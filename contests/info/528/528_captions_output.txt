This discussion turned out to be more weighted than I anticipated.
I propose we let the matter slide until the next meeting.
Mr Trump has assured me that this building is fantastic and your disgusting chairs are rolling to be politically correct.
I get the feeling that none of you are leveling with me.

I accept payment by sliding scale

We're meeting here today to address concerns about changes in this company's perspective.
Welcome to the first corporate retreat to be held aboard a cruise ship.
You see, here at Trump University, it's all about balance - balancing your work load, balancing your staff, and balancing your check book. We teach your how to rise above all of that nonsense...
"Reports circulating that the company is going downhill are simply not true".
Members of the office space committee, you're fired!
I'm here today to address your concerns about a lack of a level playing field within the company.
This new conference room should help us get everyone's slant on things.
My decision tilts heavily against.
The immediate effect of Brexit on our business fundamentals is apparent.
The most numerous complaint is that our content is coming from a rightward slant. Thoughts?
Yes, the rumors are true. We've pivoted.
I have good news and bad news about our artificial gravity project.
Sometimes it pays to be at the head of the table!
Modern architects only care about the exterior.
Lunch today will be sticky rice.
For now on you will look up to me.
Sorry guys. Your ideas were good; but Mr. Hendricks wants to take the business in another direction.
I don't know why you all insist that things are slanted around here?
We're asking for a raise.
Well, I'm not sure who came up with the idea of a level playing field, but you can get that silly notion out of your heads right now.
Carl was always talking down to his colleagues.
Will those passengers with the last remaining ticket on the lifeboat please move to this end of the prominade deck
Can anyone give me a new slant on this situation?
Angle? What angle? I don't have any angle.
Did I fart?
We've up-graded the conference room.
This business is quite literally in decline.
C'mon, just level with me!
First item on our agenda is the deck chair rearrangement update.
All in favor, say 'Wheeee!'
Well, I'm disappointed--I was hoping you'd level with me.
These shipboard meetings seem to be driving us apart.
This is the only conference room where our revenue projections look acceptable to management.
haha does anyone know where we got those brownies?
So it seems that I'm Scotland on this one.
I sense it will take awhile for the impact of Brexit to fade.
Perhaps one of you would like to propose an adjournment?"
Grumble all you want, condescension rules.
Last Monday's earthquake drill was not a success.
i'm here to confirm that it indeed flows downhill
I don't think you people are on the level with me.
Yes, your gravitas is bigger than my gravitas!
I can officially confirm what you already know; we're going under.
Here in HR we call this tilting exercise 'Rearranging Deck Chairs.' Who wants to go first?
So, you think I should give up bicycle commuting for the summer?
I didn't mean to, it snuck out.
I assure you this offer is on the level.
I thought we would all benefit from putting a new slant on things!
I see you've already gotten things rolling.
You asked for a democracy.
I think we've lost our focus...group
The first one to roll up here gets a promotion!
Mr. Dibbles, that's NOT the best way to make the sales chart trend upward.
My course on abstract committee-room design was delightful, thanks for asking!
Today's focus group discussion is on paradigm shifts...
NOW do you get the gravity of this situation?
Really, people. This is just an optical illusion.
The quick fix would be to remove the casters from each chair.
I get the impression that someone is rocking the boat.
I'm afraid the company is going downhill!
I think this shows us what the problem was in the elevator this morning.
So in conclusion, having a sliding scale for your business is just not a good idea.
We've lost all perspective in wha we have been trying to achieve.
As the Boss, my chair wheels came with safety locks.
I'm here to give my slant on this issue.
I think I've figured out how to level out our declining stock price.
Why do you say it's a weighted question?
I don't think you all fully appreciate the gravity of our situation...
I appreciate your input, but I'm the boss and I say the building's not falling over.
I think the argument is tilting in your direction
Now onto our third corporate value: A Level Playing Field.
Don't put your life into perspective. Conquer perspective!
I'm fully prepared to crush you all with this table.
I want to know which one of you contracted out the building renovations and I want to know now.
As a temporary fix we will remove all the casters.
I'm here to get things in line.
I've got gravity on my side.
Perhaps we can level the playing field a bit.
Well, we all knew a "leave" win in the U.K. was going to cause problems for everyone.
Try to see it my way.
This meeting is getting away from me.
We've reconsidered the corporate ladder.
UK and members of the EU.
I would like to commend the Whiteboard Leveling Committee on their tremendous achievement.
It's called corporate malfeasance. It's troubling, but not contagious.
What I am proposing is that we all get on equal footing.
Any suggestions on how to level the playing field?
So, the Brits are out of the EU, and the whole universe is now a different place.
Stop putting a slant on everything I say.
But the lease payments are a bargain.
Good afternoon. I'm from HR. The ship is listing. You are all fired. As part of your package, you will receive swimming lessons this evening.
And they said rearranging the chairs wouldn't make a difference...
As the CEO of this company, I decided to send ALL of you Vice Presidents to the corner. You will stay there until you make ME MORE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think we can all see why tuna toothpaste was a failure.
I can see my new program for the company to expand is causing a wee bit of listing.
Who ever promised you an even playfield??

Is it the work of our 3-D Virtual Reality design team?
Somebody take a peek out the window--is there any kind of post-Brexit world out there at all?
On the plus side, today’s meeting space came in under budget.
There's been a shift in our corporate structure.
My kids bought me the new Trump cologne for Father's Day. Isn't it fantastic?
Okay, I'll be brief.
Oh no, we are crooked.
A simple "nay" will do next time, folks.
None of you seem to be aware of the gravity of this situation.
Anybody got a mint?
Everything is fine. This is fine. Don't worry.
You know what they say about big halos, right?
Hey, when this company goes on tilt it really goes on tilt.
The quarterly report shows us against the wall...Am I the only one carrying his weight?
I know that you all feel that the weight of the world is on your shoulders... that's to bad!
Conservative think tank.
HR has received several complaints about the weight of your consciences.
Did you meet anyone you knew on the way down?
Let's not have a slanted perception here.
I think you’ll find our earnings chart looks more profitable from that angle.
It appears you are leaning in a different direction.
This wasn't mentioned in the SWOT analysis.
Our next lesson wil be 'wheel-locking-during-room-tilts'!
Our profits are sliding....as is the building.
I didn't tell you..instead of building a wall I am just changing gravity!
Things are definitely looking up, here at Teeter Totter Inc.
I never know whether to say "you" or "you guys."
Okay people, we are always being accused of our slanted view. Can someone tell me where this comes from? My view is fine!
I learned how to be a leader from Mr Trump. My brain is better than yours so listen to me. I speak for the people.
At Maplewood Lanes, there are bowling advancement opportunities available, if you work hard and apply yourself.
Dammit, somebody put in a call to whoever is running the U.K. these days--I wanna know what the hell this all about!
...this table is not fair and square , but it is helpful in keeping you at arms length .
Y'know, I was going to throw all of you under the bus today, but putting you up against the wall works, too.
Sorry about that. I had chili for lunch.
Normally, I would never slant things in my favor, however . . . .
And that's just one more example of why I'm at the top and the rest of you aren't.
Surely you can all appreciate my perspective.
Now that we've reached international waters, let's discuss our overtime policy.
Level floors? Level floors are for closers.
From my point of view its astounding.
Ready for another weighty decision?
In this focus group, we're simulating the trickle down theory.
Thanks for connecting!
It's that damn fracking, I tell ya!
I still expect a balanced vote on this.
All right, then, this meeting of the board of directors of American Roller Coaster is now called to order....
Now that you know what our bottom line feels like let's get back to work.
Now you're all in breach of the 'no footsies' contract you signed.
And lastly, all in favor of booking a room at the Pantheon for our next meeting say Aye.
Now who says we cannot make 'Titanic, the Sequel'?
The balance of power has shifted.
If we level the playing field, our profits would drop.
No, I'm pretty sure this is more than just a paradigm shift.
What made us have this meeting on a boat?
You must admit...I have a good angle on this project.
All those in favor of removing the wheels from their chair, say aye.
One final question..do you consider our Titanic Ride realistic enough?
Does tipping to the right signify anything in particular?
Keep calm and carry on. It's just Brexit.
I can't hold this table forever, you know.
I suppose you're wondering what this all about....
And that is why this is the last Frank Gehry building we will commission.
Whoops!
Our first order of business is to discuss the gopher problem.
I see the weight of opinion is against me...
So, the motion is for next firm retreat ashore. Seconder?
So, I'm the only one taking the high road here?
Our industry seems to have reached its tipping point.
Did I mention that this was a location shoot for China Town?
I don't mean to shout, team. But it's your angle I'm most frustrated with.
And who wants to volunteer for this assignment?
I'm just hoping Frank Gehry will give us a partial refund.
And they all moved away from me at the "Group W" conference table!
This is a strategic shift.
I didn't think the table was stacked that much.
Too disruptive?
Since our building has shifted, do we all agree to change from chairs with wheels to chairs with suction cups?
Sure, that was a really big one. But was it as big as a fully synergized network of thought leaders?
The should do it for old business!
One of these days we're going to balance the debt.
Our next retreat will be on dry land.
Who seconds the motion for wheelless chairs?
You guys seem like you're really on a roll.
I believe the evidence is slanted in your favor.
I'd like to propose that we purchase chairs without casters.
I thought having our office in an iconic building in Italy would give us some recognition.
I see differently.
We knew the relocation to Pisa would present challenges.
OK, who hasn't weighed in?
It's halitosis, it's really no big deal.
You'll have to admit it was a blast having 30 seconds of weightlessness.
I designed it like Steinbrenner's Yankee boardroom.
I wish you'd all just be straight with me.
So, no "flat Earthers" here today?
When the OSHA guy gets here, everyone look casual.
Sorry, I don't believe in gravity.
Though novel, renting office space in Pisa was a mistake.
Before we begin, would someone please straighten the whiteboard? It's hanging crooked.
For those of us sitting at the table, the future at our company looks very bright.
Anyone who wants a donut come to this side of the room.
Et tu, Brite?
While you might find my position untenable, wait until I turn the table!
Even though I'm now part of management, I want us to continue to be a team.
As you've probably guessed, we're on a bit of a downslide.
You guys just can't sit still.
Our company was started with a shaky foundation, so this is no surprise.
Looks like the presidency of Trump can only go downhill from here.
You've painted yourselves into a corner. Now's the time to think outside the box.
The room is straight, the picture is crooked
The good news is this quarter we were able to move off the level playing field.
This ought to give you some incentive to climb our corporate ladder!
I think we took a wrong turn with our decision to begin fracking.
Ladies and gentlemen, the landscape of our company is changing.
Skewed in my favor!? I resent the implication!
We need to start looking at this from a new angle.
I'll concede; that question was a bit weighted.
I thought for a change , I would deliver your checks to you personally .
I think if we get our expenses down we can level things off this quarter.
I wasn't going to mention it, but I just won the lottery, so it's too bad you're all against me.
When I said you all need to pull your weight, this is not what I meant
I guess I just don't see the gravity of the situation.
" I guess you're all wondering why I brought you together like this ." * this underlined .
The next release is devastating.
No, we are not going to be working on a level playing field.
Now this is what I call a level playing field!
Oh, sure, you all SAY you want a seat at the table . . .
The Lombard Street Homeowners Association meeting will please come to order.
Does anyone want to join me on this side of the aisle? My pens keep rolling off the table.
Okay, who hired the architect?
Mr. Cameron, we're just a bit confused about what the plot of the sequel would be.
Your group condescension clearly reflects the gravity of the situation.
Is it just me or is the painting a little crooked?
marco. polo.
There has been a seismic shift in our industry
Yes, I can see how you might take that slant...
You may be correct and unified, but your thoughts are slanted.
Sorry, I know you're upset, but I DID call same seats.
The key is putting paper clips in the rollers; oh yes, and hiring an architect who does not drink.
I wanted you to get a different perspective on our growth chart.
I don't care what this looks like, you're selling "level!"
OK, I'll level with you.
I see the room has shifted.
You're probably wondering why I called you all there.
We need to approach this from a different angle.
That's certainly a lopsided vote.
Ceci n'est pas une optical illusion
First, let me welcome you all to Pisa.
This meeting of the Cruise Line Shipping Association is now called to order.
Since Brexit, we've been experiencing a downward trend.
Meeting adjoined.
Let me level with you.
I must concede that opinion has tipped in another direction.
The good news is the earthquake flat
I see the boards view is a little off kilter this morning.
No, I don't think my opinion is slanted.
Well, now that you're here, we can start dinner.
Yes, I’m the architect. What seems to be the problem?
In my professional opinion, there's been no paradigm shift.
Please Cross Your Legs Miss Simpson !
Don't let their slanted testimony sway you.
Always remember I am the Captain of this listing boardroom.
The 'move to table' is out of order.
Welcome to our Carnival Cruise Line "Boardroom-At-Sea" Auditing Ecstasy Getaway!
It seems we've reached the tipping point.
The contractor said he can fix the whole problem with a couple of shims.
This adds a whole new slant to my proposal
I'm looking for a new angle for this cartoon I have in mind.
I've changed the meaning of 'board' to 'bored'.
As your can see, the stock performance chart looks much better from your angle.
And what a great pleasure it is to have our first board meeting on the Titanic.
I know you all think I'm stuck up. I am.
I want a team that can roll uphill.
We work on a sliding pay scale.
I think we've reached a tipping point.
Feta cheese has been removed from the lunchroom selections.
I'm not so sure that green lighting a sequel to 'Gravity' is a good idea.
It's obvious which way the room is leaning
Someone is underperforming, and that's the elephant in the room we need to talk about.
No, Maureen... gravity is NOT an excuse.
Now, I don't want you to feel I don't value your opinions
We will need to work together if we are going to right this ship.
The vote seems a bit skewed, but I say we still have to go down with the ship.
I disagree that it's an uphill climb.
Well, obviously this committee is leaning to the right.
Things are not going well, but corporate has asked for a moratorium on the "Titanic" jokes.
But I said 'safety'.
Obviously what we have here is a "right-leaning" focus group.
Ok, it’s unanimous. The motion is tabled.
Who ordered Piza?
Look, the evidence that this company is too highly leveraged speaks for itself.
I'm open to suggestions on why Ace Architects just can't close a deal.
You would think that the CEO of a major oral antiseptic company, would know how to use it.
Time to rearrange the deck chairs.

We smell - We hear you Mr. Toot.
I learned this leverage technique from my children.
Think positive! You are entitled to your opinion,but I'll make the final decision.
So who ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch special?
I know my views are a little slanted but hear me out.
Cooties isn't supposed to be a thing anymore, you guys!
Today's meeting is about what's trending down.
It's just a cold sore
This is exactly why we don't piss off the sherpas!
It is still the view of the board that the ship is not sinking.
This meeting is going down hill fast.
I don't like the way the balance of power has shifted.
So is that plan paradigm-shifting enough?
Welcome to our right leaning focus group.
I’ve been letting some things slide recently.
I strongly disagree that this reorganization is simply "changing chairs on the Titanic."
They're called “locking casters.” If you ever expect to move up in this company, you need to start paying attention to detail!
I've gathered you all here today to feel inferior to me.
We've hired you because we think the company would benefit from more vertical integration.
I see the balance of power has shifted.
Trust me, it's not a slippery slope.
Brexit has turned things a bit askew.
Now you know why I didn't offer you any coffee.
Management now has the upper hand and we are initiating the following new work rules:
This is a paradigm shift.
AS NEW MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD, YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO LOCK YOUR CHAIR WHEELS.
No need to be afraid.
And next Monday we'll meet to discuss getting chairs without wheels.
I think now would be a good time to show our recent sales graph!
I'm the boss here, and I decide how level the playing table will be.
This is a board room, not a playing field!
It's unanimous then. I'm the foreman.
I have a different perspective.
Why do you always have to be so obtuse?
I'm told that you have a bunch of new ideas.
Ignore this California weather, who's presenting first?
You're probably wondering why I brought you together like this.
Y'all know you can lock these chair casters, right?
We can be a top selling sales group, but stop being so selfish. I didn't say selfie!
You're right, I would rather get an anal probe than decide between Trump or Hillary.
Does anyone else want a Dramamine?
According to the latest polls, there is a noticeable tilt to the right.
Next item on the agenda: using the restrooms.
Is it my imagination that you all seem to be leaning toward taking early retirement?
I think you proved my point: you're all being let go because you weigh us down.
From your perspective, do think the picture is level...?
From your perspective, do you think the picture is level...?
Alright, who's responsible for hanging the crooked whiteboard?
I'd like to make a motion.
The latest figures suggest we're on the decline.
This is why we have a head of the table
Come on in and rest a spell.
So no one's volunteering to do publicity for Kanye?
You may have all taken sides against me, but I still have the upper hand.
Are you sure we've got the right angle here people?
This focus group is about self-esteem.
In conclusion, let me assure the board that this business is in no way a sinking ship.
Welcome to trickle down Econ 101.
'First, welcome to Pisa.'
As you can see, your opinions have more weight than mine.
Well, this is the way I roll!
OK, who stuck their chewing gum under the table legs?
The report recommends that we move to a solidly built building and sue the architect. Any comments?
There's a motion that we become a standing committee.
As you can see, the outcome tilts in my favor.
This is what I mean by top-down decision making
Should we vote on a "no tipping" policy now?
You look hostile!
Standing desks are out. Hiking desks are in!
I should've had a V8.
I'm reading a book on management, and I've learned a new tip.
Okay. Okay. I get it. The floors are a little uneven.
Jim finally realized just how bad his breath was.
Right, so maybe a board room inside the Titanic wasn't the greatest idea.
Either this is an earthquake, or I'm losing the argument.
Management has asked me to come clean about something. We all work in a yellow submarine.
This office needs to be on an even keel.
The frame's not right.
I don't like talking down to people but...
......but on the upside
Perhaps, relocating to Pisa isn't as glamorous as I thought.
Yes, we pay on a sliding scale.
So I perceive the entire room is in opposition!
Yes in my opinion it does roll downhill
It's just so it won't crash into you
In this company you have to climb the table.
We need to meet in the middle.
Just hope you are still interested in investing in the new Titanic.
It's all a matter of perspective.
If revenue is down next month, expect the table to have wheels too.
To be completely fair, I was chosen by sliding scale.
We are experiencing a seismic shift in the balance of power.
Not just our stock is sliding
You're looking at it from the downside.
Our motto here is to be fair and balanced!
At the count of three, everyone run to the other side of the room.
Just in case you haven't noticed, this corporation is sinking.
That's why I make the big bucks.
I'm not contagious, I swear!

I seem to have you at a disadvantage!
Someone, please straighten out the white board.
The See-Saw architecture firm will not be rehired in the future.
It's an optical illusion folks!! Get back to the table!
The window reflects our quarterly report - delusional.
You all say things are looking up; I have a different point of view!
Now I'm going to level with you folks
The company's been on a downward slope.
We've got to get the company back on an even keel, guys.
In hindsight, when I built this office tower, I should have hired a professional.
And with that out of the way, let's get lunch
Cut that out! It's not the floor, it's the frame that's crooked.
We like to support local farmers. And by local I mean within the same galaxy.
All those in favor of concluding our maiden staff meeting aboard the Titanic, say aye!
Was it my breath?
You are here so that together we can face a change of seismic proportions!
Whatever happened to "Gesundheit?"
I knew that contractor with the eye patch was all wrong for the job!
I realize that things have been stressful around the office lately, but I assure you that we're now on the downward slope.
With you in my corner, anything is possible.
Upon closer examination, we felt that the table should not be removed.
This isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted you to come up with a new angle
Okay group, and what is your slant on life?
I am tired of hearing people say the company's going downhill.
Now, as a politician, you think everything I do is slanted....
Well, maybe if you all worked a little harder we could afford to fix the sinkhole.
Although I am at the top, things will "trickle down".
I'm afraid we're going to have to make some structural changes.
I'm pleased to get the opportunity to address House Republicans on Climate Change.
I know this is late, but I'm a new reader & just saw the 6/27 issue & couldn't resist sending 2 captions: "It's poker night and we could use a fourth." OR "It's OK, we drink responsibly."
Red Rover, Red Rover, send Braxton from accounting on over.
I'm afraid I am going to have to ask all of you to Cosine.

Corporate has decided to leave LA.
Another uphill battle?
I see that it's going to be an uphill battle to get you on my side.
Before we begin, can someone straighten the picture please?
Due to the raging storm, this ship is sinking. The bad news is, this is going to cause a drop in share holders for our cruise line.
SILENT MAJORITIES CAN CARRY LOTS OF WEIGHT
It seems your opinion outweighs my logic.
Okay, I think I've held the table long enough so I'm gonna pass it one of you.
I see the tides have turned, but there is no need to exaggerate.
Anyone know who put a lien on this building?
Today's topic for discussion is "Has political thinking in the United States shifted to the right?"
I'm sure you agree that we need to keep this company on an even keel.
I think your view is slanted. Look at it from my angle.
"All those in favor of gravity say 'aye' ".
This company has never stood for a level playing field.
As members of the Board, we must accept that things are on the downhill slope.
Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea.
I know it doesn't look so great now, but I think our cruise line investments eventually will pay off.
It's a sliding scale approach.
From now on, we'll be operating on a sliding scale.
This debate is lopsided!
We are proud to offer all of our employees a level playing field to succeed...
Now that you've mastered slant, let's talk about spin.
Would you say this company treats men and women the same?
Let the record show that it's 7 to 1 in favor of level floors.
We now have little hope that the Trump and Brexit anomalies will cancel each other out and return balance to our universe.

I can't put my finger on it but something feels askew?
Like Trump I'm taking the company in a new direction without directors.
Thanks to you, we've overtaken industry leader Lean Cuisine.
In closing, be prepared for when the business reverses course.
We need to change our company name from On-the-Level Building Contractors.

Is it fair to say you all think it was my decision?

I decided not to get the Tilt-A-Whirl.
Will everyone who agrees with management's plan to cut wages and benefits please assemble on the far side of the conference room?

We've combined scalability and leverage. Questions?
It's not contagious.
Well, what do you think? Will this reclinable building sell better than the reclinable chairs?
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why my dog ate my homework.
Having spent time there I can say with confidence this Zika thing is over blown
The good news is, I was able to get you moved out of your cubicles...

You, there, on my right, what's so damned funny?
Just to demonstrate that it's a slippery slope.
We appear to have reached the tipping point.
I expect you all to work at full-tilt.
I'm leaning that way.
Getting to this position was an uphill climb.
I would like to address the rumors of instability in this company.
Thank you for your comments. I'll now vote.
Very funny guys. Now straighten the picture and move your chairs back to the table.
Any more questions regarding the 80-20 rule?
I think you're all too focused on the slippery slope meme.
Ok then, it's agreed. We'll move our offices from Park Slope to Flatbush.
Our strategy of vertical AND horizontal integration has really skewed profits.
Our unique rotating window frame is particularly useful on cruise ships and in areas prone to sinkholes.

Company benefits will be given on a sliding scale.
We are not here to discuss a Level Playing field
Welcome to the Titanic Boardroom where our motto is Never Let Go
I had an agenda, but I see the listing has already begun.
I need 3 volunteers to help me fix this situation.
Our magazine has been falsely accused of slanting the news.
It seems the architect took "balance of power" quite literally.
Now, I want to give you my slant on things
I want to assure the members of the board, that the perception of an imbalance between yourselves and me, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, is completely unfounded. Thank you.
I need 3 of you willing to relocate this position.

Our company is sinking.
I want to approach this meeting from a different angle.
Now the proposal to move from this Pisa Tower office.
Most of you warned me about the foundation. I just didn't listen.
Everybody laughed when I suggested emergency brakes for our chairs. Look at us now.
It IS lonely at the top--but I like it.
That's what I call bottom-up strategy.

Yes, Brexit has had unintended consequences.

I want to welcome everyone to the first meeting of our conference here on the beutiful HMS Titanic...
The company has reached a tipping point.
Lets get started....we will be introducing our new line of garlic breath mints in the fall.
It's time I leveled with you.
I presume you now understand the gravity of the situation.
I can see which way the room is leaning on this one.
Alright, who turned on the ride?
Right-wing politics
In order to have a good understanding, I feel it is important to give everyone the slant on this project upfront.
I understand there have been complaints about the disparity in salaries of management and staff.

I am at the head of the table for a reason.
I said, "I think we're having trouble with our axis of ordinates, not that we're axing subordinates."

Sure, we can add that to the agenda.

Okay, that takes care of the demotions.
Nothing been the same since the earthquake .
Your editorial policy is definitely slanted.
Here at Teeter & Totter we value intern feedback.

I think we need a new angle.
I'd like to call us to order . . .
I'd like to start off by giving you my slant on things.

Only now may we fully appreciate the gravity of our situation.
This is our new board set-up. Now it's easy to tell who is the boss.
Do I sense some dissention in the room?
I can see that achieving consensus will be an uphill battle...
Thank you all for siding with me on the budget cuts.
Okay, so how are we going to spin this? Ideas?
Now, it's true that some might say that I'll do anything to tilt the process in my favor, but I frankly I have no idea where such accusations come from.
"This is a sliding scale workplace".
I was told I have a knack for putting a slant on things.

First of all, we need some perspective.
In all fairness, those at one end of the table deserve the same as those at the other.

Let me give you my slant on the new sales projections.
I’m going to level with you.
Now that I have your final vote, people, let's get the hell to the lifeboats!
I see you understand the gravity of our situation.
I'm at 1% right now
To get to this position was an uphill battle.
The optics may appear to be somewhat slanted, but management does not believe that the company is sinking.
The vote is complete, the high has it.
As you can see there is a downside to a hands free approach.
Our competitors can do whatever they want; but we were founded as a pro-gravity organization.
I never claimed Seasteading would be easy, but look: We can do whatever we want. You guys could, for example, restrain me, cut off my dick, cook it and eat it in front of me. Now, we won't be doing that. Unless...? Ha, no, really, I'm kidding. Really
Let's try again, no religion.
Our diversity policy is a success: we've leveled the playing field.
You're being rated on a sliding scale.

Now here's my slant on the problem.
For chrissakes, do we look like windmills?
No Bob, I still don't know why the TV isn't tilted.
You can run, but you can't hide
If our company could compete on a level playing field, we wouldn't have to let you go.
First off, we never promised you level playing field.
I'm going to level with you people...
I've been telling you for weeks that we need a new angle to improve sales, and now I think we've got it.
ok... if I don't vote for him will you come back to the table? I'm getting sea sick.
Bottom line is we're going need all hands on deck this quarter, it's time to right the ship
I think we can all agree that it's in everybody's best interest that some members should reconsider their position.
We're getting chairs without wheels next week, I promise.
This month, we're encouraging group-think.
Don't panic. I'm confident we'll get bailed out: we're too big to fail.
So, it's fair to say you're leaning toward restructuring.
Well, it looks like we've reached the tipping point.
'Tell all the truth but tell it slant' is now a reality.
This was the most ergonomic way for me to look down on you all.
We are trying to go at this from every possible angle.
So, that's my thinking on the subject. Who's with me?
You are all aware by now that things are not tilted in your favor.
According to Mr. Gehry's legal team, we simply aren't understanding the concept of the building as visualized by Mr. Gehry.
You can understand the gravity of the situation.
What do you mean, you feel alienated from management?!
A shift to the right was necessary to stay in this election race.
First, let's talk about the purpose of a focus group.
Yes Jim, you're right. The artwork is still level. And that is why our self-leveling frames will revolutionize cruise ship decorating!
Don't panic. They did away with the sliding scale in 1930.
How do you like it when the table's turned?

Do I have good social skills? People are 'drawn' to me.
As a show of support, our board meetings will now mirror our earnings chart.
I call this board meeting of the Tower of Pisa, Inc. to order.
We were selected to right this corporate ship of state.
Everything is leanear.
There are no 'do-overs' in referendums!
Maybe Gehry wasn't the best choice for the interior.
I'm afraid Brexit is taking us down with it.
Would one of you straighten the whiteboard?
All I'm asking is for you to look at it from my angle.
Sorry...beans for lunch.
First, let's drop all this nonsense about leveling the playing field.
I take it this isn't a hostile takeover?
I don't recommend soup for lunch.
I think this puts our disagreement in perspective.
I see you have the majority in your corner.
Honestly, I don't know why you think this meeting is weighted in my favor.
I see this is going to end in a hung jury.
I'm serious: don't everybody jump up at once.
Remember, YOU, are our greatest asset at Pisa Incorporated.....
Quit complaining. You wanted a tilt toward democracy and now you've got it.
Again, any rumors suggesting a downward slide with the company's performance are unfounded.
The decline due to Brexit should be temporary.
But we do support you, Mr. Trump!
Jones' popularity ebbed after farting during the board meeting.
Why am I the only one to bring anything to the table?
You're all literally on your way out of this company

I forgot and had Mexican food for lunch. Sorry!
Some places give you the Ax..I prefer the "guillotine table"
Let me start by saying the company hopes you are enjoying our new state-of-the-art shipboard offices. We're still working out some issues.
It's over, gentlemen. I have the high ground.
Now watch very carefully as I do a wheelie on the table.
The Lone Ranger first board meeting
Welcome to New Balance.
The advantage of being at the head of the table with earth shattering news!
I told you the last time we needed a different perspective.
As Chairman of the Board, I'm willing to show you some leniency.
And that my friends, is how babies are made...
Am I safe in assuming that, from your perspective, things are starting to look up?
Thank you for attending the final meeting of the Titanic Safety Committee. George, explain your suggestion about installing life preservers in meeting rooms.
For tax purposes, we're relocating our offices to Pisa, Italy. This should help you all adjust.
I've called this meeting for input on potentially co-creating a more level playing field with you workers.
Now you know why I'm always at the head of the table.
I'm slowly coming around to the idea that the business is reaching a tipping point.
Our new seating is based off of the revised org chart.
C'mon ladies, just 'Lean In'.
As you probably already have surmised, we will be discussing Stegner's Angle of Repose today.
Look, we're an insurance agency. I can't cancel this meeting because of a teeny earthquake. Our meeting indemnity clause doesn't cover 'Acts of God'.
OK, everyone in favor of the new fitness center, say aye.
Apparently the line graph wasn't clear enough
Did you guys learn your negotiating skills at Trump University?
We couldn't afford a Union contractor.
"Equality" does not require a round table .
I guess our new slant on business has its downside.
Anyone see my pen down there?
I thought we could save a lot of time at this get-acquainted meeting.
My achievements are immense when you all come together like this.
Welcome to our corporate offices in Pisa.
You may feel that the weight of the argument is on your side ...
So, what are you thinking?
As your new manager, I want you to know I'm very interested in your ideas and suggestions. Just bring them to the table for discussion.
Come on guys, is there someone here who can give me a two point perspective on this situation.
I'm sorry, but now that the bank has placed a lean on the building, I have no choice but to let all of you go.
What leads you to believe we aren't using a level playing field?
C'mon folks! We work in finance, you've got to roll with the ups and downs.
In the future, a simple "nay" would be sufficient.
No thanks, I don't chew gum.
We know our jobs here have always been an up hill battle, but isn't this a bit over the top?
Now that we have established the appropriate balance of power, we may commence our meeting.
Everyone, the company is going sideways!
I suddenly feel like the United Kingdom.
On the upside!
We're hoping that putting a new slant on these meetings will bring everyone closer.
Honestly, when I suggested moving our headquarters to the Himalayas, this never occurred to me.
Maybe we should stop thinking outside the box
How many more studies of global leaning do you people need?
On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have opened a branch office in Pisa.
Management for Dingbats 2.0, The Picture Edition. How to table a motion when no one else wants to.
Red Rover, Red Rover, send Doug over.
As you all can see, our consumer demographic is extremely skewed.
It's downhill from here onward....
Welcome to a meeting of the pro-gravity association!
Remember, this is not a pyramid scheme.

First off, we have to admit our business is undergoing a sea change.
Well, this is off to a good start
Despite the Appearance, It is really not me against the other members of the Board!
Welcome to the agoraphobic support group.
So...a show of hands...how many think we need to level the playing field?
The inception of the teleconference.
As you can see, there was no projection of an iceberg event.
Now, I don't have to keep my head on a swivel.
Yes The Board has weighed in your favor, but...
I said "Eureka" not "I've got Zika".
...but last month you loved the idea of an office yacht?
As you can tell, we're in the middle of restructuring.
I told you the level playing field was a myth!
Just roll with me for a moment.
Can anyone look this up ?
These meetings always seem to go downhill.
It appears as though the Ayes have it.
As you can see, I don't like a level playing field.
One of the many reasons I nail my feet to the floor.
...and all against mutiny move to my side of the table.
Like the job description said, we're looking for a candidate who is upwardly mobile.
Would you agree, the geometry doesn't feel right in this room?
Never hire an architect from Pisa.
I get it. I have bad breath.
First order of business; let's fix that window.
Don't worry, this company is unsinkable.
Level playing field? I think not!
And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is why in California we bolt the tables to the floors.
We're being smeared as not fair or balanced by the liberals.
While I understand that my predecessor was fond of the so-called roundtable discussion . . .
It will cost too much to straighten the building, so we are just going to take the wheels off the chairs.
Each of you have feelings and opinions that are important to me, but I've asked you here to shut up and listen.
Tilt the room all you want, I'm still the decider.
So, who wants free tickets to the Summer Olympics?
I win.
Our research indicates that fracking has absolutely no adverse effect on the environment.
The downside is significant.
You'll do anything to skew it your way.

I assure you that we'll have our image reframed and back by tomorrow.
I promise, this is better than death by PowerPoint!
Shall we continue discussing the potential earthquakes here in Oklahoma?
When I said we should have weighted voting on the measure, I meant it literally.

Well, now you have my slant on it.
So, you think this organization is a little bit slanted? Why would you say that?
And, finally, a special thanks to Lyle for his very special perspective.
I KNOW , BUT LET'S DISCUSS IT FIRST....
I'd invite you to sit back, relax and enjoy the meeting.
Those in favor of chairs without rollers raise your hand.
The gravity of all this is pretty obvious.
Get back to the table and fix the crooked video screen.
Our world has shifted and we must respond.
I'm afraid my skewed perspective limits my ability to see your jobs as anything other than dead weight.
It's the screen that's askew. Not to worry.
Believe me, I would really like to level with you guys.
Okay, this meeting is going downhill fast
Ok, I promise, I'll never reference " the Donald" again
You are all being dramatic. So I had some tuna for lunch. Big deal!
No more affirmative collective leaning-in. It's a new ball game where I want to see what each of you has to bring to the table.
The next wave will have you all on my side again.
Let's put all our cards on the table regarding the new contract.
This meeting really got away from me.
I hope you don't box yourselves into a corner during these negotations.
You must understand this group does not follow majority rule
I'm pleased to see that all of you appreciate the gravity of this situation.
Again, it was one of the tiniest summer eisberg.
Just before I shift my thinking next time you will have to remove your wheels. I can't stand your collective, pathetic flight to the corner.
When I took the chair, I warned you that cutting corners would put you in a tight corner.
And now for a new slant.......
I want to hear whateveryone at this table has to say.
I'd like to propose a different slant on the problem.
So that's the way you roll here?
I think we can all agree – it’s been an uphill battle AND a slippery slope.
When you position yourself just right, you can avoid the downturn's effects. Understand?

As I was saying, it flows downhill.
No bosses in my boardroom!

The moment when Bill suspects his aftershave lotion is too strong.
On behalf of the entire corporation, I'd like to welcome you to Allied Shipping.

Here, we believe in a level playing field.
We really cornered the market!
Does anyone else have another slant on this topic?
Before we begin does anyone want coffee?
I think that picture might be crooked.
The whole damn scheme is collapsing.
As you know, we all are here to restore political balance to the media so please begin the arduous trek towards the center of the table.
First, let me address the rumors that the company is foundering.
Now do you see the gravity of the situation?
Due to events beyond our control, the round table discussion has been canceled.
This is ridiculous. I didn't think we were living in Scotland?
Ok, I get it. Boats, casters. Not an option.
Let the minutes reflect that future meetings will be held in conference room C.
I'll entertain a motion to re-center.
It's called gum.
So that's how we roll
I think we need to look at this from a different angle.
'Let's get rolling' is just a figure of speech.
I loathe the San Francisco office.
I'm afraid we're on our way to falling through the cracks.
Being new to San Francisco , you will get used to working on a hill building.
No, you can't sit at the conference table, we've eliminated middle management.
O.K., then, we're all agreed: replacing this table with a round one would not make everyone feel more equal.
Welcome to Ms. White who will set us upright.
This is a lot easier than climbing the ladder
I'm at the head of the table, so I win this version of ' company chairs '.
I warned you this was a slippery slope.
I thought it would be helpful for our structural engineers to meet at the project.
I propose we order more water glasses and place the casters on lock.
Good news! The breaks for your chairs are on the truck!
Who says that I look down on them?
While the slant I have brought to the table might appear a bit extreme, I never intended for it to put your backs to the wall.
I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.
I need to keep my distance as I read the will.
That you would choose this particular gesture of solidarity while we're meeting on a boat only serves to highlight the need for new ways of thinking.
Benvenuti, membri del consiglio turismo Comune di Pisa!
So you heard, I just got back from Rio!
I didn't think this was a junior high dance!
I want to welcome you all to the first meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Mystery Spot of St. Ignace, Michigan.
Thank you for coming. I hope you're all comfortable. Can everyone see the screen?
In bad news, there is no money left in our Grappling Hook account.
Who's idea was it to have this meeting on a cruise ship?
I did not realize that our business management team was so lopsided.
C'mon, people, this isn't the Titanic....yet.
This project is going downhill.
Welcome to the Economic House of Mystery.
Say "calf rope."
You thought eight against one ping pong without paddles on office chairs would be easy.
Try gluing your hands to the table.
Im tabling our discussion of gravity
I'm leaning against.
Lean-in! Or, step-out.
How many of you know how to swim?
The lesson here is that sometimes it doesn't matter that your chair has wheels.
I knew it was a bad idea to hold our meeting on a ship
Why do I get the feeling you're not all leveling with me?
You may all disagree, but I have the upper hand.
Does anyone else smell that?
Now that I have the floor...
All of the staff is now being evaluated on a sliding scale.
Looks like mixing business with a cruise wasn't such a good idea.
Admittedly, our business is trending downward.
So, I think it's fair to say that we've reached our tipping point.
I appreciate your calm as we work to right our organization.
So, we are all in agreement that it would not be a good idea to change the name to BIGYBIGYBOATFACE, and we stay with Titanic. Shall we adjourn for tea?
One more time you morons: What's wrong with this picture?
Is Wendy the only one with any balls in here?
I resent your inference that this business is not on the level
It's not my fault that you all have wheels on your chairs.
Sorry about that, I had a burrito for lunch
What's it going to take to bring you all to the table?
Why didn't anybody bring anything to the table worth discussing?
If any of you are angling for a raise, you can forget about it.
I gather you'd like to discuss spacing issues.
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
Our company is on the upswing.
Those with unlocked casters will never be at this table
Not to rock the boat or anything...
Now all the charts are up and to the right.
We're on a very slippery slope here.
This is as level as the playing field is ever going to get.
Next time don't put the floor plans in cursive.
So, what's your tilt to our new ad campaign?
This Board must recognize its position relative to the Chairman.
Harold is rocking the boat - again
In retrospect, the architect's affinity for Marx might have been a dead giveaway.
Have we turned the tables yet
Then it's unanimous, this vote will rock the boat
I sense a bias here.
So who can guess what's about to roll downhill?
The field has always seemed level to me.
Pay will be on a sliding scale from now on.
Ok, so maybe the cheaper contractor did mess up the new floors.
Now that I have everyone's attention . . .!
we need to level with each other...
I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning in your direction.
From where you are sitting, it's all uphill.
This is not about picking sides.
As the Chairman of the board it is my job to put things in perspective.
Like I told you, our new super glue really works!
As you can see, our business is not doing a well. As you can see, things are not going well with our business.
I sense that you all have shifted your position on this matter.
I don't think tabling the proposal will work.
Did I hear a motion?
I'll count to 3, and then I let go of the table.
Sorry, but the Tower people tell me this lean will last until early November.
I sense the board is already leaning one way on this issue.
I don't think I need to explain the company bias.

First, I really appreciate everyone gathering together on such short notice.
I called you here today to discuss the importance of using a level.
Could someone please straighten the whiteboard?
Just because I'm the boss' son, don't think that things are tilted in my favor.
Downsizing
Need I remind you our fourth quarter goals will be an uphill battle...
We may now vote on the steerage of this company.
I can certainly understand your perspective...
If any of you oppose, I will literally crush you.
Why would anyone say I have a condescending attitude?
All those in favor, say "Aye, aye!"
P;ease take your places. Only the screen is tilted.
If anyone still feels I'm heading in the wrong direction on this one, please just level with me now... before collectively rushing madly off in all directions!

It's my company, you don't get a referendum!
Catch!
I think I've figured out why you've all been feeling like things are going downhill lately.
Admittedly, this process is biased...
That was an interesting slant on the situation, Johnson.
So, what do you think will make you stand out most?

First, I'd like to thank you for participating in the Fox News "vote with your wheely-chair" citizen survey."

If we don't get a new perspective we're going to be crushed by our competitors
Please remember - my vote carries the most weight.

This is a new game called table tenants.
I hope you feel comfortable. Let me know if you need something.

Why can't you see management's point of view?
I want you all to level with me.
So much for the level playing field idea.
I'm terribly sorry but we're going to have to postpone addressing the glass ceiling.
We have to get a better ping pong table!

Ok who wants to go first?
Since no further motion is possible, the meeting is adjourned.
First let me assure you that your pay won't be on a sliding scale.
Now that's a thought. Maybe carpeting would be the solution.
Who said anything about an even playing field?
I feel certain I could bring a new perspective to your company.

How would you rate our intern icebreaker events?
I'm here to straighten you out.
Next on the agenda is how will the company's profitability be influenced by the tilt of the earth's axis.

I called this meeting to discuss certain downward trends.
I’ll remind the room that the proper term is “Supply Side Ergonomics".
And again this year I recommend we budget for chairs without wheels.
So, offshoring doesn't mean moving to a boat?

I've always wanted to be looked up to.
Sales are on a roll.
All in favor of stationary chairs, raise your hands.
We are all facing a downhill problem.
I suppose you all are wondering why I asked you here today
Rigged? What makes you think the system is rigged?

My cartoonist has been drinking again
Folks, there's been a management shakeup.
OK, who pressed Tilt?
Let me try and put this into perspective.
Someone please put the picture straight
I can have the wheels removed from your chairs, but that's all!
This chair will oppose any unanimous descent until the table is motioned!
The architect said this would stimulate discussion.
I am still not inclined to take your proposal
Usually these negotiations are tilted in the other direction.
Does removing the casters deal with the symptom and not address the problem?
you do know that "cooties" don't really exist right?
First of all, I would like to welcome you to Sisyphus Corporation.
As I have just demonstrated, it's not who you are, but where one sits, that counts in our New World Order."

Try looking at it from my point of view
Go ahead...Lean in.
Dave, would you please straighten out the easel board?
I don't suppose that someone could get me a cup of coffee.
Holding our board meeting at sea may have not been the best ideal.
We've hit a downward trend!
It's a unanimous vote for vertical window blinds.
I know we've had our ups and downs.
I would like to talk about everyone's willingness to "lean in."
Does that picture look crooked to you?

Are you one of the 100's of millions who doesn't suffer from pharmaceutically induced vertigo? Well now there's...
Well, that's my perspective on that issue.

OK, who wants to take the lead on the sinkhole story?
I hear there's been talk about leveling the playing field around here.
Did you all get enough lunch?
How dare you accuse me of not leveling with you!
I bet now you'll stop asking why I always sit on this end.
The board thinks we'll benefit from a new perspective.
I've been saying this Board was on a slippery slope for years!
As Math Department chairman, I view this as a very bad sine.
So you're all leveling with me by saying you want a raise?
I'm sensing a subtle power shift within the group.
Looks like the nays have it.
This company's going downhill.
Unfortunately, this quarter we're seeing signs that our business is in a downward slope.
As I was saying, our company is on a roll and our product is rockin'
On the matter of my remaining as your CEO, the 'nays' appears to be unanoymous.
I take it the board has changed its position
Who ordered these Herman Miller chairs without caster locks?
It appears the board is not leaning in my favor.
Ok, so maybe it was a bad idea to hold our board meeting on the Titanic this year.
We MUST get this company right-sized and back on track
Wait till you see the optical illusion bathrooms!
...and now I invite you to share your perspective.
I feel alone in views
All in favor of rearrangement of the Titanic office chairs say "Aye"

Listen, you small people !
The trickle down theory is not producing the results we'd hoped for.
Yes, this quarter your company is facing both a slippery slope and an uneven playing field!
I'm afraid I'm not moved by the weight of your argument.
This just demonstrates why this committee must mount a vigorous protest against more fracking.
Okay, let's review the deck chair assignments one more time.
I had hoped you wouldn't notice my fart.
I am feeling a shift in the market.
Ok, so no one is on my side.
You people are going to be surprised by the new slant I have on the issue.
Unfortunately, Brexit has trigged a precipitous decline for our business.
It's not you, it's me.
As your CEO, I know you look up to me for a new slant on how to address our decline in business.
Look, maybe Trump isn't all that bad.
So somebody tell me why you all think we've tilted too far to the right.
Emails come and go, but friends are forever. Right?
Remember: If you think you are something that flows downhill, it's just an illusion.
I am finally beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
It's just an illusion.
Depending where you are, mobile technology is changing everything.
The playing field really IS tilted.

Despite your misgivings, this is a titanic opportunity.
First of all, let me thank you for your responses to my `lean in' campaign.

Casting call for Titanic
The Board has decided to phase out the teeter-totter division until the current situation rights itself.
You people ever hear of Velcro?
Yes, I understand it's an issue that's weighing heavy on everyone's mind. Bottom line: Approximately how high would this wall need to be to keep both Donald AND Hillary out?

You're making me feel like the villain in a 'Batman' episode here.
This is what happens when you let things slide.

I do hope you all understand the gravity of the situation!
All rise.

When the Ship of State lists to the right, we need to take the high side.
Anyone remember the story of the Titanic?

Not exactly what I meant when I said "hol' up, I need my lean to get turnt." Y'all white af doe.
Would anyone like to second the motion?
I just don't understand why you can't see things from my angle?
I can see this is a "right leaning group", but lets try and keep an open mind.
And, finally, I yield the floor to an agenda item carried over from our last session: sinkholes and conference-room traction.
According to our accountant, we're about to go under.
From where I sit, the view of the majority seems rather slanted.
(With additional stock price falling graph on wall). Reports show us that if they have wheels, it's a lot easier arranging chairs on the Titanic.

Now you see why i talk down to you!
Not only is the rent cheaper but the building has great drainage
So I take it, then, that you feel the same way about Hillary?
Which one of you demanded a level playing field?
We are no longer a flat organization.
No even one of you has anything to bring to the table?
I was thinking of a tighter packed community. So far, so good.

Downsizing was inevitable.
Should we waive the reading of the minutes?!
I suppose my greatest strength would be my dominion over gravity.
It's the new floating floor.

Come on people, keep up!
Thank you for participating in this focus group - how are you enjoying the cruise so far?
I move that we table the motion.
I believe we need to fire the architect.
I understand your point about the 1%, but actually, right here right now, I'm 12.5%.
Marketing suggests 'Tippecanoe'.
What shall we tackle next, the glass ceiling or the floor of discontent?
I call it tetter totter economics.
People –there is no democracy on a boat.
Our mission here at Gravity, Inc. is to prove it's not just a theory.
As I said, everything is 'top-down' from here on out!
You will continue to be hostages until you admit that everything this company has done has been on the level.
Thanks for the report on corporate fairness. Next up: board restructuring.
I need at least three volunteers.
I'm going to let go of the table now.
We need to address the elephant in the room upstairs.
At least we saved money on chair brakes!
This room was designed for dissension

As you all know, it's been a topsy-turvy quarter.
All in favor of suing the architect...
Yes, it's unsinkable. Any other questions?
What axis does work start at?
Can we at least try to level the playing field?
It's a good thing that you're all sitting down....
I am strongly reconsidering our ability to be fair and balanced.
Board Meeting at The Mystery Spot (Santa Cruz, CA)
I just want to quash the rumors that this company is a sinking ship.
Leveling the playing field will not be as easy as you might think.
Since I can't hear any objections, the motion is passed.
....OK the ayes have it. All future meetings will moved to Florence.
"You will, during your shift--of course we pay minimum wage--make multiple social media comments about how large are Mr. Trump's hands." Mr. Trump will choose the best one for a free weekend vacation at a Trump hotel of Mr. Trump's choice.
.......nor is the deck stacked against any of you.
Let's get this straight, balancing the budget is just part of the problem....
I've decided to let go of managerial control and delegate.

Now that my little demonstration has your attention, look to the right. I present the future of our company, The Zip Zap H09 Self-Leveling Monitor.
Before we get started, would someone straighten the picture?
First order of business: let's change these castor-wheels with some sticky rubber feet. Second order of business: let's fire our architects.
You may have noticed that things seem to have gone downhill lately.

I needn't remind you of the gravity of our situation.
I will not agree to this settlement!
Now that you have all found your proper places in the new board room.....
I thought you'd all be leaning the other way.
I suspect you'll all be inclined to agree with my proposal.
Daddy says bonuses are now on a sliding scale.
I told you NOT to quote Emily Dickinson.
Dad build this company with his bare hands. He was a terrible carpenter.
Look, team, Brexit has been rough on everyone. But let's just try and make the best of our relocation to Pisa.
This is why we should have voted *not* to work in the Leaning Tower of Piza.

I don't think you all really appreciate the gravity of situation.

I knew getting an office in the Leaning Tower of Pisa was a bad idea
Practical, no. Demoralizing, yes.

I press this button and 'voilà!' I control the floor.
Looks like the whiteboard didn't get the memo...
… so we’ll be trying the brake test again tomorrow…
Why does it always seem like Frank is talking down to us?
New aftershave. Too much?
Not what I meant by lean business, people!
I know my CEO pay defies gravity...but you have to admit it feels appropriate

Is that your final answer?
Ok, I'll stop buying my cologne from the dollar store.
Sorry, our glass ceiling just wasn't quite cutting it.
I'm afraid the meeting is going to go downhill from here on.
OK, who's against me?
Now that I've gathered you all together.
We have a problem, and I know you'd all appreciate some straight talk.

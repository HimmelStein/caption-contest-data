OK. But we'd better make it your place.
I'm peeping, Tom.
2 stars. Park view, but a bit cramped and just eggs for breakfast.
Show me anywhere else this close to the park for $2100 a month.
I found it on Air-B-In-Tree.
They are artificial twigs from Ikea. Assembly was a snap.
No more taxes or bills, and no more having to chew my own food.
It was advertised as a one room walk up.
Learning to fly was easier than living in a fifth floor walk-up
It's listed on airbnb as "authentic tree nest experience".
It's only temporary - I'm flying to Florida next week.
It's an Upper East Side zip code.
When was the last time you saw an unhappy squirrel? Think about it.
Yep, Airbnb.  I can't wait to see what's for breakfast.
My parents just said that it was time to leave THEIR nest.
My kids wouldn't leave the nest so I had to find a new one
Well, they want us off the streets.
Welcome to the Branch Office at Park Place.
I wanted a first floor climb-up with lots of natural light.
Eat your heart out, it's rent controlled.
Hey mister, got any bread?
The tiny house was too big.
She said I lacked the ambition to live on Central Park West.
With your brother's Netflix password, I think we can afford this.
You forage, I hatch.
It just seemed like the obvious answer when my therapist  said I was suffering from Empty Nest syndrome.
Just tell mom I found a cozy nest with a park view, and not to worry.
I like to tweet on location
People are really impressed when I tell them I have a view of the park.
I’m just not ready to leave the nest!
I know Dad, I’m just not ready to leave the nest.
It said "cosy 5th Ave 1br w/vu."
I found something I can afford that isn’t a walk-up.
Aren't you back a little early this year?
The ad said," reasonable rent, park views and huge bathroom"
I'm home!
Airbnb.  Central Park Views.  What more can you ask for?
Mom should be back any minute with breakfast
I swore I'd never live in a walk-up, but the view really sells it
You call me 'homeless', but I prefer 'inhabitant' of a 6 branch conifer/river vu.
That's not what I meant when I said "build a nest egg".
Well it’s better than living with you!
I met an eagle on Tinder.
My realtor went out on a limb for me.
Central Park view and only $2000 a month!
The listing did say it had a "bird's eye view" of the Park.
The treetop views are what sold me.  Plus, my roommate goes south every winter.
My boss said don’t come back to work until you hatch some new ideas!
It all started with my parents sitting in this tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
This beats living with my parents.
I'm housesitting until the owner returns from South America.
I've got hardwood flooring!
The owner is in Florida for the winter.
Yup, fully off-grid. You should see where the toilet is.
Just keeping them warm until she gets back.
It's the new Brooklyn.....
Just make sure not to park your car underneath
Airbnb on Central Park, $30
It gets more natural light than my current apartment.
I’m warming the eggs as a favor. Mother robin is over there on the windowsill watching “Game of Thrones.”
It's amazing what you can find on 'AirBnB.'
Sure the bathroom situation isn't great...but open concept on the upper west side, what more could you ask for?
And the best part is, I don't have to share a bathroom anymore.
No, I don't think you are the father.
My building went coop.
I leased out my apartment 'till September. Then I'm flying the coop.
Pop, if you let me have two million a year I can build these all over Manhattan.
The previous owners took off to Florida.
Yes, this is the advertised cozy and affordable Mid-Town nest for rent!
Housekeeping is a breeze!
I'm renting a room from some empty-nesters.
It’s prewar, and look at this hardwood!
It's mine until Spring when the owners will be returning from Mexico.
They don't call it AIR bnb for nothing!"
Have you seen the tuition at NYU?
Duh, they flew south for the winter and put the place on airbnb for a song
Who knew Fifth Avenue could be cheaper than the West Side?
...and it'll be even more affordable once I get a roommate!
The rent is cheap-cheap.
But, Dad, it's, like, my first baby-sitting job!
Nothing special. How about you?
I'm tired of city life.  I've moved to the sticks.
I’m egg sitting for crazy rich pigeons.
Did you "find yourself" yet, son?
I’ve decided to take my tweets to the next level.
You were right Dad! I do feel a real sense of accomplishment in my own place.
Be patient. In a few days I'll be able to tweet.
What can I say?  The rent is cheep-cheep!
I'd rather sleep up here—that park bench is for the birds.
I inherited a nest egg!
This is not what I meant when I said we should start preparing for empty nesting, Barbara.
I always wanted to live on a beech!
My parents always told me I would end up in a place overlooking the Park.
You know, this whole tiny home movement has really taken off.
The kids moved back home, and I miss my empty nest."
Just waiting for Mom to get back with dinner.
You get the best views of central park and it's only 2150$ per month!
"What did I say, Fred? Location, Location, Location.
Second floor walkup. Park view.
Rent's cheap and the chicks aren't bad.
...and I don’t even have to chew my own food.
People just think I'm a hipster, not homeless!
It's triple what I'd pay in Queens, but so worth it.
Not until they hatch.
I figured this is a great way to meet chicks.
It's really spacious now that the kids are at college.
It's an air tree n tree.
it's small but only $1,000/month and what a view.
I think this air tree 'n tree thing could catch on.
. . . and that's how I was able to retire!
Would you be doll and get me a triple, venti, soy, no foam latte please?
I sublet it from a couple of snowbirds over the winter.
Just don't stand there, bring me mud and twigs.
I hear a couple Maples on 59th are still available through AirB&B
It took forever, but I'm finally an empty nester.
I'm just subletting while the owner winters in Florida.
Hi! I’m Robin.
My old life wasn't sparking joy.
Just resting on my laurels.
Actually more space than my last place.
Unforgettable trips start with Airbnb.
...and, best of all, it's in your price range!
I found it on Airbrd.
Rent is pretty good, but dogs keep using my bathroom.
It's really not that bad... people have been tossing me chunks of bread all day.
Next week, I fly to Florida.
The ground floor is still available.
How do you expect me to lay an egg while you are staring at me?
And can you believe it? - She waived the broker's fee!
It’s a fixer upper.
Fight or flight were my only two options.
It's all the rage in Portland.
I misread condo for condor.
Why, yes, I am ovulating.
Too broke to fly South
A tree house grows in Brooklyn.
I call it my 'Marie Kondo condo'.
They let me use it while they’re in Florida for the winter.
So, this is your airy, spacious apartment with a panoramic view of the city.
The listing said 'View of Central Park'--may be a bit of a stretch once the foliage comes in
The pigeons act like they own the place.
Hey, it’s free. And I get to crap on people.
I'm officially an Upper-Nest-Sider.
It's a rent-controlled high-rise with a nest egg, Dad.
The bench got a little old after a while so I thought I'd branch out a bit.
Say what you will, but the rent is cheap, cheap, cheap.
The roommates are vacationing in Florida and I’ve got the whole place to myself.
I love it here in Brooklyn - a spectacular skyline view and only $2700 a month!
Yeah, Dad. This time I've moved out for good.
No, it’s an air bnb.
Should be any minute now. I'm just keeping the eggs warm while she takes a break.
At least they respond to my tweets.
Found it on Airtreenb
Great view and my mom brings me food.
The Airbnb listing said ‘rustic perch with access to the park.’ I’ve already contacted the host about a hair dryer.
Compared to Babysitting & Dogsitting, Eggsitting is a BREEZE!
In today's economy, I'm in no rush to leave the nest.
The ad said “a view of the park and rent controlled.”
Did you tweet?
Bought it from an empty nester!
I just sent my last kid to college.  Give me a moment.
Kids? No, they've flown.
I thought it wouldn’t kick in until later in the pregnancy, but here I am.
Retiring in New York is more affordable than you think.
If they wanted it empty, why'd they let me major in philosophy?
I'm subletting while the owner migrates South for the winter.
Cheap, cheap cheap cheap
Yes, I know I'm early, but I didn't want to wait until May and all the good trees are taken.
The bench made it all work.
I changed my mind, I want kids.
It was the obvious progression after my 'tiny house' phase.
It's just an Airbnb, the owners have a nest in Boca for the winter
The L.L. Bean catalogue, page 32, and it comes in plaid too.
My grammar is fine. I'm laying, not lying.
It was the one Airbnb option that fit my budget.
This is my family tree, that’s why.
I owed a bird a favor.
Just listed, a cozy loft in a great location, perfect for outdoor entertaining.
The mother said she'll be back in 15 minutes.
I was going to use the bench, but then most people would just look down on me.
My roommate said he's bringing back some chicks.
I'm taking a gap year before I spread my wings.
Son, it’s time to leave the nest
When you said "nesting" I thought you meant something a bit more 'Crate and Barrel'
It's all part of her 'New Green Deal'.
You're taking this name change a bit far, Robin.
The realtor says the furniture is all natural oak
Sure it's a loft.
Just house-sitting while they're on vacation in the south
I'm housesitting for them until spring comes.
Dad... I found a place to stay and people feed me. What do you think?
Yes, I am an odd bird.
Just the sweetest little sublet - owners are snowbirds, south for the winter.
...and the best part; it’s only 1200 dollars a month.
My mom is actually getting me food right now!
My college admissions consultant suggested I need to have a "unique and authentic" experience.
I'm egg-sitting in exchange for a place to stay.
I'm brooding so you're on the bench tonight.
Airbnb...cozy retreat...city views.

You must be the downstairs tenant!
It's really taken my people-watching to the next level.
You got a better way to meet firemen?"
Yeah...I live in a loft off Central Park

Keep walking mister. I’m waiting for a cute firefighter to rescue me.
You should sit down, this is going to take awhile.
Unfortunately, there's still an association fee.
Oh, I’m just house sitting. The owners fly south for the winter.
On the upper East Side it's all about the view.
My parents thought I'd never leave the nest.
Found it on AiryBnB.  Why?
The ad said magnificent view of the park!
Sure, it's small, but there's no co-op board and the views are priceless.
I’m thinking outside - just not using a box.
Well some pickles and ice cream would be lovely.
So, yeah, I'm sitting on a pretty tidy nest egg.
It was the only thing I could find on the Upper East Side under a million dollars.
Best pregnancy reveal ever- am I right?
It's an Airbnb.
It’s $1,000 per month with an unobstructed park view.
Well, yeah, it was pretty dodgy at first, with the squirrels all in an uproar about gentrification, but nothing beats the rent control".
If you can't find a place on Fifth Avenue, it's only because you're not looking.
The view is great, the rent is free, and I get fed 10 times a day.
Staycation
I’m glad I got in when I did. I’ll be priced out of the market come Spring.
The owners are snow birds.
The Branch Manager promotion came with a housing allowance.
YOU try getting an affordable place right next to Central Park.

It's really true what they say about nesting instincts in your 7th month.
Nope, I'm not coming down.  I'm happy as a lark up here.
My financial advisor told me to protect my next egg
Silly man, no I’m not homeless, I have a nest egg.
It's drafty, but rent-controlled.
It's month to month until the spring migration.
Well, yes; my name IS Robin.
It's a little squirrelly but I call it home.
Hi. My name's Robin.
What? This isn’t what you meant when you said I should start working on a nest egg?
Be careful. People have been sliding off that bench all day.
This is Fresh Airbnb.
It’s called the Tinier House Movement.
I still have my pied a terre.
Sure, but I'm getting Manhattan for less than 800 a month.

You must be Jack. I'm "Empty Nest on Central Park West."
Airbnb is branching out.
Cheep was a pun, not a typo.
Joe, I did tell you my name was Robyn and
I lived on Central Park West!

My parents finally tossed me out, so I just googled 'Millennial housing' and came up with this.
Yes, this is what I meant by "nesting". What did you think it meant?

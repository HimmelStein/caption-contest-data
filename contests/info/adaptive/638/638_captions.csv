I wear the pants but my wife controls them.
I wear the pants, but my wife has the remote.
Nothing you buy on a 2 am informercial is ever a good idea.
To be honest, I’m kind of flying by the seat of my pants.
Seriously? You've never tried a pair of hoveralls?
This is Otto, the other is Hannah — they’re palindrones.
The puppy wasn't attracting the type of women I'm interested in.
It’s not so bad. I had helicopter parents.
And that’s when I just decided to fly by the seat of my pants!
My wife forgave me for the affair.  With conditions.
I'm Adam, your Lift driver.
We didn't understand cargo pants at first either.
Hi, I’m your Uber ride.  Grab my hand.
This is much better.  I used to fly by the seat of my pants.
In hind sight, I should have agreed to an ankle monitor.
YOU can wait for the walk sign.
Always wanted to fly by the seat of my pants.
I like to fly by the seat of my pants.
The only danger is if they see a squirrel.
My wife has the remote
I see yours are still analog.
No - I can't fly yet, but I can hit a high C.
First time in the Bay Area?
I've got them set between low-rider and full wedgie.
I’d wait for the next upgrade. There’s a wedgie issue.
My wife is at the controls . . . long story.
The only problem with them is if there's a strong gust of wind my voice goes up an octave.
SkyMall. Why do you ask?
The good news is that I get uptown in 10 minutes. The bad news is that I land with one hell of a wedgie.
It was either this or an ankle monitor.
Mr. Smith? I’m your Uber ride.
It's called upward mobility.
Turns out you don't have to put on your pants one leg at a time.
Alexa, hold up my pants!
You must be the fellow who ordered a friend on Amazon.
It’s the convenience of suspenders without the ridiculous look.
Ask me where I keep the remote.
The judge said it was either this or the ankle bracelet.
Hi, I'm Steve from Amazon Cloud Services.
I'm flying by the seat of my pants.
Well, I guess I’m going to take off.
Actually my wife has the controls.
Well I'm off.  My Lyft is here.
Amazon sent me. Your book is backordered.
You're experiencing what is known as 'disbelief of suspension'.
Yeah, I had helicopter parents, why
They're my emotional support drones.
I said I BARELY NOTICE THEM ANYMORE!
All I said was: "Hey Alexa I need a lift," and this happens...
They keep dropping me off at Amazon.
At first it was just a joke, but then I got the Department of Defense contract.
You act like you've never seen a pair of chastity drones before.
As you probably guessed, I'm single.
I lost the car in the divorce.
I hope I have been ordered by a nice family
It's just until the sexual assault charges are dropped.
They're great until your kid steals the controller.
The battery life is pretty short, and that’s led to a couple of embarrassing incidents.”
One leg at a time, that's how.
Guess who just put his pants on TWO legs at a time?
No lines ... no tickets ... just fly by the seat of your pants.
Yes I'm single. Why do you ask?
Plus, with the turbo option, I can go up a full octave.
Best part? I can use Tesla charging stations.
It’s not so much about holding up my pants as it’s about attracting venture capitalists.
They're controlled by a joystick in my pants.
Alexa, fix my wedgie.
It's the hot new fashion...hoveralls
Gotta go.  My Lift is here.”
It's better than flying by the seat of my pants!
They're just for technical support
OK, you have the remote, right?
And now, when people say, "He puts his pants on just like you and me," you'll know just how wrong they are.
Ya, you get a wedgie.  But I can be in Hoboken in five minutes.
I prefer to fly by the seat of my pants.
You also get an owner’s manual, a pack of adult diapers and a barf bag.
Hi, I'm the drinking buddy you ordered from Amazon Prime.
They're my suspenders of disbelief.
I'm here for your Amazon return.
Sure, but once he builds that wall, these babies will sell like hot tamales.
I admit it can be a little embarrassing when the batteries get low.
Hi!  I'm Joe, the personal assistant you ordered from Amazon.
Of course my wife has the remote control.
AirUber.  Where to?
I place an order on Amazon and - Pow! - these babies deliver ME to my stuff!
The balloons looked ridiculous.
Are you the one who called Amazon Customer Support?
Why, yes, I am Mr. Fancypants.
My wife got the bra version.
I have a mini one to do my zipper.
Hi, i’m Your Lyft driver.
Wow, you're still using analog suspenders?
I’ve been sent here to see if there is anything we can do to stop you from dropping your Amazon Prime.
The only thing I don't like about them is I have to call the FAA every time I want to take off  my pants.
yeah...product of helicopter parents
No one thought the iPhone would catch on, either!
I have a patent suspending.
Unfortunately, I left the remote in my other pants.
Sir, your Lyft has arrived.
The hip-hop setting is eight inches lower.
By design, I fly by the seat of my pants!
Look, they put my pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else.
When you go low, I go high.
I only have to wear them until my wife trusts me again.
Honestly, I feel 20 pounds lighter.
With the Drone-penders 2.0, there's no chance of getting caught with your pants down.
You ordered a handshake on Amazon, correct?! Here it is!
I know it looks weird, but I haven't been mugged  once since I put them on.
Amazon needs a clarification on your order.
Amazon Customer Support here, how can I help?
To be honest, yes, I am a little worried about the battery life on these things.
Imagine the possibilities for brassieres.
I don’t  know how I managed before self-driving pants.
Hi, I’m your ride
They came free with my Prime membership.
The view was great, but the wedgie was brutal.
They have two speeds...tenor and soprano.
Now, Prime members can be delivered to their online orders.
Greetings, I'm from Amazon and I'm here to help.
I see you're still wearing analog suspenders. You need to think bigger.
I wanted to fly by the seat of my pants.
Hi, I'm your car-less driver. Where can I drop you?"
The free app syncs with my calendar, so I never forget to wear pants to a meeting.
They keep me on my toes.
I don't mind; I was raised by helicopter parents.
Go ahead build the wall. I'll make millions.
A life well-documented is a life well-lived.
Hi, I'm Frank. Professional drone walker.
I thought about suspenders, but I didn't want to look ridiculous.
Just a natural progression from helicopter parents.
Basically they're fully autonomous... but I can still take over the zipper in case of an emergency.
I am your date.  Match.com now has drone delivery.
I also invented noise canceling trousers.
Next year I'll just tell them what I want for father's day.
I use to be one of those helicopter parents.
I still adjust my fly manually, though.
If they pull my pants any tighter it is going to be
"unmanned" flight for sure."
I see you're still sporting the analog model.
Just wait until you see how I hold my socks up.
Just because they suspended my driver's license doesn't mean I'm grounded
You're late on your Amazon Prime payment
Marvin, this is the last time I'll get your ball off the roof.
Amazon can now go directly into my wallet and remove money without bothering to delivery anything.
I can't understand why the judge considers me a flight risk.
Well, when the batteries die, it does get a bit awkward.
Alexa sent me.  I'm Greg from Prime Friendship.
I don't like waiting for the "WALK" sign.
They're working on little ones for your socks.
Now I really can fly by the seat of my pants.
it was either this or an ankle monitor and i'm like so let's have some fun
They’re waiting to see if I want to return the pants.
It’s best if I don’t tell you where the remote control is.
You did order a lyft, didn’t you?
I put my pants on like everyone else. One drone at a time.
Ironically, it was only because two people gave me the same gift that I found a use for them.
I put them on same as everyone else; one leg at a time.
They work great except for the wedgies.
The only downside is that it gives you a really bad wedgie.
It's a new service called "Lift."
And if you think that’s impressive, wait until you see how the zipper works.
We're still having some problems with the necktie option.
I might have to take off early.
I also programmed my Roomba to tie my shoes.
They're a must have for the committed helicopter parent.
I may have been born privileged, but I still put my pants on one drone at a time—just like everyone else does.
The settings go from low rider to wedgie.
Tssh. You still wearing analogs?
Actually, I don't put my pants on one leg at time!
Two to keep your pants up; six to get airborne.
Sure beats taking a cab, but I wish I had worn my relaxed-fit jeans.
Mostly I fly to the battery store
This is what I call tech support!
Same as everyone. One drone at a time.
I'm Andy, from Amazon's new on-line dating service. Are you Michael?
It’s the latest from Lyft!
Hi. Bob from Amazon.
Your wife ordered you a friend on Amazon.
The only downside is my voice occasionally sounds a little higher.
Safe? Of course it's safe. I've got 2 gps-guided drones with 4 gyro-stablized propellers on each for software and hardware fault tolerance. What could possibly go wrong?
This seemed more functional than a cape and tights.
Well, it was pretty embarrassing when both batteries died at the same time.
I call them 'willing suspenders of disbelief.'
...But I still put them on one leg at a time.
I'm Frank.  I'll be your Uber driver.
Tell me the belt industry isn't nervous.
I'm supposed to deliver you to your mother's for Thanksgiving.
These babies get me to work in 10 minutes but for some strange reason my voice is higher for the rest of the day.
Gone are the days when I could lift myself by the bootstraps.
They work fine, but I'm having some intimacy issues.
I put my pants on just like everyone else, one drone at a time.
Helicopter parents are so last year.
I’m thinking of calling it “Lyft.”
I’m the BFF you just ordered on Amazon
Sorry I'm late. I got held up.
Hi. I’m Matt from Amazon.
I'm a fly by the seat of your pants type of guy
I'm not sure what it does, but I got it with 2-day free shipping from Amazon!
Hi, I'm your driver.  Grab my hand and hold on tight.
I’m Amazon’s new tech support.
I use to be a Helicopter dad,but I need to keep up with the times.
Mosquitoes stay clear and my pants stay hiked up. It's a win-win.
I have ten minutes to charge these before my pants fall off.
I’m gonna need either a belt or a charger in the next 15 seconds.
Other than raising my voice a few octaves, they work fine...
Hi I am your Amazon personal shopper...
Yep, I really am flying by the seat of my pants”.
Hi, I'm the new assistant you ordered from Amazon.
I found them in SkyMall.”
What? You're still using Uber
This changes the game for a 5 story walk up!
I'm telling you, helicopter parenting isn't enough these days.
Practical? No. Suspenseful? Yes.
Talk about "flying by the seat of your pants."
Jetson, George Jetson”
Didn't you order a man from Amazon?
Thanks for noticing. I did lose 10 pounds.
Yeah, boxers.  Definitely, boxers.
Your mom sent me. She says, "call her back."
Hi! I’m Dan, the window washer.
Would you happen to have 7000 AA batteries?”
It was either this or the ankle bracelet
Why yes, my suspenders do come with Bluetooth.
No one thought the bra would take off either
Everything was going great until  an 8 year old got a hold of the controller.
I used to fly by the seat of my pants, but I've modernized.
I’m your Lyft driver, just hang tight.
Who knows what the future holds? Right now, they just hold up my pants.
All the good jobs are in the cloud.
So I no longer have to put my pants on one leg at a time.
Hi. I’m here with an update on your Amazon order.
Cmon, I'll give you a lift.
I'd love to drop by...what time?
Thought you’d never ask. To hold my pants up.”
I'm beta-testing Uber's new self driving pants.
Thank you for calling Air Taxi.  Hold my hand tightly.
It’s only annoying when I have to go to the bathroom.
Just don't clip them to your underwear
How do you do? I'm the new butler you ordered 2 hours ago from Amzon
I just let myself fly by the seat of my pants.
Now if I can just work out the wedgie problem.
As beta testing goes, it could be worse. There's a jockstrap version of this thing.
I'm your lift driver.
I think of myself as upwardly mobile
Surveillance or delivery?
I've stopped using lyft.
And they delivered themselves!
They come with Amazon Prime Wardrobe.  Returns are super fast.
Hi George.  By shaking my hand, you accept our terms and conditions.
Some days I just need a lift.
Lyft? I' ll show you lift!
Don’t be offended if I start talking down to you.
It's my Halloween costume: I'm the Suspension of Disbelief.
It's part of H.R.'s new sexual harassment prevention program.
It helps keep me on my toes.
Nice pants. You pull them up yourself?
If I am not back in five minutes, call the F. A. A.
My kids think I'm one of those helicopter parents
I’m done flying by the seat of my pants!
Hi, I'm Trevor, the friend you ordered from Amazon.
Didn’t you order a Lyft?
It has its ups and downs.
The station can't afford a news chopper so I got the next best thing.
It's been nice chatting with you, but I've just been cleared for takeoff.
Not only did Amazon just deliver this belt they're installing it too.
I' m just flying by the front of my pants.
No offense, but I just think suspenders look ridiculous.
Revolving doors are particularly problematic.
What's amazing is that nobody thought of it sooner.
I put my pants on one drone at a time.
I, too, thought it was a great idea, but it just hasn’t taken off.
These are my last two certified emotional support drones.
If I leave them home alone they'll tear up the furniture.
Because, when I had only one, I kept going around in circles.
Now that’s amazing... three minutes ago I ordered suspenders from Amazon!
But mine lift and separate.
Yes, the wedgie is an issue.
Well I've gotta take off, great talking with you.
They're great when you need a little pick me up.
I used to be a belt and suspenders man too.
It all started with an Apple Watch.
You ordered a friend?
If you can ignore the wedgie, it’s the only way to fly
Hi, I'm from Amazon HR. Thanks for your application. Got time for an interview?
I'm the delivery guy for Amazon Sub-Prime.
It's way faster than the crosstown bus as long as you don't mind the wedgie.
They were working great until a hacker from Vladivostok gave me a long distance wedgie.
These Amazon drones are delivering a "package" if you know what I mean.
I am not your Uber I am your Lyft
Yes, I put my pants on - one drone at a time
People told me no one would want a driverless option for pedestrians. Well, who’s laughing now?
Just give me the keys.  And next time, try to remember where you parked.
This isn’t what I was expecting when I called for a Lyft.
They found out I cut off my ankle bracelet...
Actually, they're pretty submissive once you've established who's walking whom.
My wife has the joystick
Hi, Alex from Uber Air
It's called technology, Ted.
And they keep my pants up.
It beats the ankle bracelet.
You didn't get the upgrade?
I put my pants on just like you - one drone at a time.
Yah, I'm over Uber
Sure the constant surveillance is uncomfortable, but so was my belt.
One leg at a time?  Not any more.
As usual, we don't NEED it until they invent it.
And now no one notices my bald spot.
They also come in business casual.
Twenty percent less than Uber, no traffic, and, for a little excitement, we can do rooftop drop-offs.
The only thing they can't suspend is your disbelief.
Suspend disbelief, man.
I’m your Uber ride. Grab my hand.
Why put up with the tyranny  of suspenders when you can control your pants with the touch of a button?
Oh for sure, but I still put my pants on one drone at a time.
Would you like a lift?
That's what they said about Uber.
The only real drawback are updrafts.  Those can raise your voice an octave or two.
You still do yours one leg at a time?
People only seem interested in how I go to the bathroom
Taking them down would create other privacy concerns.
Be careful not to enter my personal air space.
It's not about who wears the pants in the relationship anymore, but who controls them.
If you lost the remote control, I'm in big trouble!
I used to be just an ordinary peeping Tom.
Lately I feel like I've been flying by the seat of my pants.
I don't wear belts with them. That would look ridiculous.
Can I bum a battery?
I am from Amazon customer service.
I bet you read a hardcopy newspaper too.
I'm a handyman. Thanks to Amazon I can be delivered straight to your door
They’re the new Elon Musk suspenders.
Wait here while I find out where we parked.
It keeps the mosquitos away.
I'm your Uber.  My car broke down, so grab my arm.
Just thought I'd give myself a lift.
Belt and suspenders? Seems a bit much.
'"At least it's some consolation to know that there'll be video from every angle if the cops shoot me."
These will take me right into Canada if the Republicans win next week.
Put it this way, I’ve never been mugged.
Because I can.
I''m five pounds lighter in these pants.
Its the cheapest flight I could find
Why yes, they do make me feel light on my feet.
One leg at a time. You?
It's a little scary but it sure beats the subway.
Of course, things can get a little bit tricky in a  men's room stall.
Now Amazon takes me to the product instead of dropping them off.
Court order.
We'd better shake hands -- I don't do high fives anymore.
But you requested a Lyft!
I'll make a fortune selling them to people who want to go over the wall.
It's great when technology is able to pick up the slacks
Patent pending, they'll be called "Suspenders of Disbelief!"
Well yes, battery life is a concern.
My eyes are down here, buddy.
Do you realize how ridiculous you look wearing a belt AND suspenders, Frank?
They’re the first suspenders approved by the FAA.
Helicopter wife
It's a little awkward when the batteries die.
Lift. Better than Uber.
Well, sure, it’s dangerous and illegal, but would you rather take the F train?
They also suspend privacy rights.
It's a little tough on the crotch, but my shoulders feel a lot better.
The wedgie is rough but it beats taking the subway.
They're Elon Musk jeans.
It does get a bit complicated in the bathroom.
My eyes are down here, Greg.
Can you believe this was already patented?
You called Lyft?
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour Jeff Bezos?
I'm telling you, these new pants are really going to take off!
What do you mean, I always over-complicate things???
You just have to watch what you clip them to - after my second flight, I couldn't walk for three days"
You should see my zipper device.
See, my mom & dad are still helicopter parents.
If I act like a package, they'll deliver me anywhere.
I'm John from Amazon Prime.
I have no idea where to put my thumbs.
I see you're sporting the old-fashioned model.
If Trump builds that wall, these devices are going to sell like hot cakes.
Suspenders are for nerds.  Suspend-AIRS are for nerds who grow up to work for NASA
I can drop you wherever you’d like.
Yep you got it, Google suspenders.
Yah the wedgie is still a problem!
What do you think? Too much?
Hi I'm your driver John, where to?
Now women can select one-click delivery on my Tinder page.
Amazon delivered me to assist you.
I mean, you saw what happened with the feathers and wax.
Suspender technology has really taken off.
The time I save is worth the wedgie.
Yes, I am the traffic reporter. Budget cuts, you know.
Amazon wants you to pull my finger.
Well yes, it does get a little tricky in the men’s room.
Please suspend your disbelief.
Looks like someone’s not keeping up with the droneses...
It's the NEW Lyft"
They like to be walked.
It comes with my amazon prime account.
I’ll try not to get carried away.
I got tired of people saying, "He puts his pants on, one leg at a time, just like everyone else"
Sure, there have been some fatalities but statistically speaking they're safer than conventional pants.
Still using suspenders 1.0?
I call them suspension britches.
These babies hold your pants up for 8 hours on one charge!
I see you're still not a Prime member.
Sorry, am I droning on?
I’ve been delivered.
It's my wife, she thinks I'm cheating.
I have NO idea. They came with the suspenders I ordered on Amazon...
I promised non-military applications. I’ll deliver non-military applications.
With the new software, my pants are supported for up to six hours.
I put my pants on like the common man - one drone at a time.
I thought my helicopter mom was a pain until I married my drone wife.
Listen, sir. I put my pants on one drone at a time...
It's only dangerous when I drop the remote.
I’ve upskilled. I am now a drone walker.
Where to?
Best of all, they deliver themselves!
Russian hackers just gave me a wedgie.
I'd give you a lift, but I'm going downtown
They are watching me either way, might as well let them hold up my pants!
And the service plan covers wedgies.
So my wife replied, “When pigs fly!”
Ha! I showed her.
Why Uber when you can Drone?
The latest in wedgie technology.
It's called Lift
Jarard wonders if this is one of those, "if you see something, say something" moments
You didn’t think Amazon was going to cut out the teamsters did you?
Hi! Adam, Amazon customer service. So, what's wrong with YOUR suspenders? You gave them only two stars and no comment.
I just need to lose ten more pounds and then it will take me wherever I want to go
They say the hallmark of modern civilization is that we provide solutions to problems that don't really exist but I don't think that's the case with Hoverspenders.
Everybody thinks that.....they really just hold up my pants.
Welcome to Amazon Delivery. You’re not afraid of heights, are you?
Yes it's a wedgie, but it's a high tech wedgie!
They're learning to stay on a leash.
They're really starting to take off.
Because they annoy more people than my leaf blowers."
Yep, when they land it is awfully embarrassing.
Are you waiting for that cab, or, are you ready for “Uber Lift”?
Two of these and you can get rid of your suspenders.  Four and you can sell your car.
I used to have a traffic helicopter, before the budget cuts
They needed to go for a walk.
I was afraid that my regular suspenders were making me look too dorky.
Tech support at your service! How may I help you?
People said the same thing when regular suspenders first came out
It’s really just about the suspension of disbelief.
I was tired of putting my pants on one leg at a time.
They also give a little extra bounce in my step.
Sorry, I have to take off
Just pretend they're not there.
works great except with my kilt.
I still put them on one leg at a time, just like everybody else.
They lift and separate.
You should see how they work on my wife’s stockings.
Lift and separate.
I just got SO sick of waiting for Ubers
The other benefit is real time monitoring of my shoelaces, right on my smart phone.
This was the best way for me to get off the no-fly list.
I called in air support.
Lyft?
So Apple asked, "What new features can we add to the iPhone 11s?"
It's the latest benefit with Prime
It's like Uber, but for pants.
Wish me luck on Shark Tank tonight!
That's fine, if you want your shoulders to do all the work.
You should see how I get my underwear on.
Welcome to Uber Air!
CAN I BORROW YOUR IPHONE?, I'M LOST.
They're called Suspenders of Disbelief.
It's the latest from the Armani-Boeing collaboration.
A little tight in the crotch, but otherwise very comfortable.
I mean yours are cool, too.
They're great! I haven't had to use Uber in a month
You ordered the ride from Lyft?
It is a condition of my sex offender parole.
Buddy, can you spare a 12-volt nicad rechargeable?
The bra version will be a lot easier now that I've fixed all the suspender issues.
Drone walking pays well these days.
The only problem is that when I go through a door my pants fall down.
You could use them for other things, but then your pants would fall down.
I'm your Uber driver.  Give me your hand and I'll have you home in no time.
My wife adopts them, but I'm the one who has to walk them every day.
You get used to the wedgies.
Hi, I'm Rick, this conversation may be recorded for training purposes.
It's drones disease.
I still put them on like everyone else, though.
It's Uber Air!
It was a free upgrade with my my Amazon Prime renewal.
Hi, I'm Ted from Amazon, I hear you want to suspend your account?
Everyone thought the Wright brothers were crazy too.
Yeah, I don’t know how I’m going to do that. I lost the controller, so I guess I’ll just have to wait until the batteries run out.
It's new. It's called Econo Lyft.
Ever hear of a drone walker? I make ten bucks an hour!
Ihey said the same thing to the Wright brothers.
It's so hard to stay grounded these days.
My interactions are recorded for quality and training purposes.
Now I no longer feel pressure to live in the moment; I can just record my life and watch it whenever I want.
Yeah well, they laughed at the guy who first invented suspenders.
This is our new Lyft service – grab my hand.
I didn't get the job and their feedback was that I have a tendency to over-engineer. Can you believe that?
There great except when they go in different directions.
I just don't trust self-driving cars.
The FAA temporarily grounded me ....
You were droning on about your suspenders and I thought, "Now, there's an idea."
No, it's not that. They were delivered by mistake and Amazon wants them back.
Trust me. I'm faster than a cab.
They take my Helicopter Parenting to the next level.
My pants?  Just got them from Amazon.  Why do you ask?
I find it uplifting.
Hi. Amazon sent me.
You do need to get used to the super wedgie though.
Listen to me, droning on and on. How have you been?
The restraining order was bad enough, but this seems excessive.
The judge gave me a suspended sentence.
This must be your first time using a flysharing service.
I have two more at home to pull up my socks
Instead of  Uber, I now "Drone Home."
Actually, right now, I'm just trying to find my ex-wife. She has the remotes.
Takes window washing to a whole new level.
I'm telling' ya, it's a shoo-in for the No-belt Prize.
I think as long as I don't get too close to the sun everything will turn out all right.
So, what's up?"
Still relying on your own shoulders to hold your pants up, I see.
Look at me...droning on about my new suspenders!
For only 20 bucks I'll erase the footage of you and 'what's her name' I took through your bedroom window.
They just take such a weight off my shoulders.
And if they're not better than your regular suspenders, I'll return your forty-two hundred dollars.
Drones are way cooler than suspenders except when the batteries die and my pants fall off.
What I save on tolls, alone ...
Where can I drop you?
I'm the husband 2.0 your wife ordered with Prime's 2-hour delivery.
Not only do they hold up my pants, but the breeze is really quite delightful.
My wife has one remote control, my mother, the other!
They keep my pants up and my enemies down.
I just thought to myself, there has got to be a better way.
You go first.  If I step off the curb too quickly I get a wedgie.
The one on the right is the good one and on the left is the evil one.
What makes you think she doesn’t trust me?
I see you're still wearing those old-fashioned suspenders.
Free transportation to work is another Amazon benefit.
Putting my pants on one leg at a time was really slowing me down
...just like Lyft, but with an i
You have to suspend disbelief
Forget about Uber—I can drop you off.
Now I never use Uber.
Who needs Uber? I have "Over."
Sure they’re fun, but sometimes they want to go in opposite directions.
Gotta fly, Frank. Sorry to drone on about my new job.
They're just like your suspenders, but they also keep me cool.
No, they are for my hernia.
Neat suspenders. Vintage?
Hi there. I’m Jeff Bezos. Are you a Prime member yet?
It requires a willing suspension of disbelief, too.
Ha! I bet you still floss your own teeth too.
It's my new product line for helicopter parents.
I'm fine, unless there's lightning.
So Timmy says "Dad, can we please get drones, pleeeease? I promise I'll walk them - I promise!"
Don’t just stand there — I’m being held up!

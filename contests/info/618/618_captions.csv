Strangely enough, you are the first person to ask about the clock.
Well of course they don’t exist. Now.
It’s on the enchanted species list.
And this is a unicorn, a rare being most don’t even believe exists. Come to think of it, you have a lot in common with him, Black Guy In A New Yorker Cartoon.
The damn thing had been leaving rainbows all over my lawn.
It's hard to get off a good shot once that carousel gets moving.
Well, sure, but I never would have believed in a Trump presidency, either.
It was hit or myth.
I figured nobody would believe me so I shot it.
Where did you get the clock?
Bagged the Emu while on Safari. Bagged the unicorn while on LSD.
I glued the horn on. I didn't want the grand-kids to know I accidentally shot a horse.
I also have a centaur, but it makes people uncomfortable.
Of course I felt bad...I was aiming for the leprechaun.
And then, just when I thought he'd gotten away, the carousel circled around again and I got a clean shot.
Turns out they're magical but not particularly swift.
In my defense, it came out of nowhere.
I’m still cleaning the glitter out of the truck.
I found it in the same place where Fox News gets its stories.
The gun mythfired.
It’s okay. They’re mythical, not endangered.
Don’t worry, it died of imaginary causes.
Coney Island carousel; 1969. Got him on the rise.
Like Chinese astrology, I assign an animal to mark each year. The antelope wall mount recalls a fast moving year full of action, the unicorn showcases a mystical year, and on its right, that mount depicts a year full of …well, you get the idea.
Extinct? Well, yeah - now.
Killing this one took some imagination.
Yes, I am that much of an asshole.
Now it's MY little pony.
I joined a fantasy hunting league.
It would be a much better story if I hadn't hit it with the car.
You're right. With my glasses on, it's definitely not a rhino.
Some say they are extinct. Some don’t believe they ever existed at all. It’s called an “Analog Clock”.
...And that was the last day my daughter ever spoke to me.
I’m not allowed back at Disneyland.
Surprisingly, a lot like chicken.
It's not what you think - I used too long a mounting screw
First you have to believe, then you shoot.
No, no... they used to be imaginary. Now they're extinct.
It was either hit or myth
It was a mess, actually. Glitter everywhere.
These days, there’s wildlife, and there’s alternative wildlife.
3D printer. My wife thinks its real.
The rich hunt the exotic. But the super rich hunt the imaginary.
It's only illegal if it actually exists.
I came across it the same place you can find Trump's tax return and Paul Ryan's spine.
Like veal but with a different kind of guilt.
The hard part was getting a hunting license in Narnia.
It sums up the whole entitled, rich white guy thing pretty well, I think.
Its magical beauty filled me with awe and wonder. So I shot it.
Well, I killed off something that doesn't exist and next thing I knew I was named chairman of the Republican plan to help the poor.
The president just tweeted that he bagged a bigger one with more horns
The irony is, I shot it with an imaginary gun.
Yeah, that was a tough one. The kid on the merry-go-round put up quite a fight.
Of course, my daughter said she will never speak to me again.
It turned out to be two guys in a unicorn suit for a birthday party, but I had it mounted anyway.
They were protected, under Obama.
No, surprisingly they're not protected
Yes.....but he identifies as an Impala....
Zimbabwe, South Africa and, of course, Narnia.
Of course, back then, we didn't hunt them because they're rare - we shot them because we thought they were gay
It just came out of nowhere.
Ran him down on my unicycle.
And I shot that one somewhere over the rainbow.
That idiot Donald Jr. sold it to me for half price because there's only one horn.
Yeah, I know. My granddaughter still won't speak to me.
Any more of those brownies?
It’s perfectly legal under new federal regs.
The cleanup was the hardest part. There was glitter everywhere.
It’s extinct now. It was called an analog clock. Not sure what that is above it.
And they said they didn't exist... well actually, now they don't.
Spied her in a clearing right next to a fiscally responsible Republican.
Shooting it was easy. Bringing it back through the Looking Glass was the hard part.
I tracked her through the lollipop forest, then the gumdrop foothills; I thought I had lost her and then suddenly there she stood, flanked by rainbows on the top of sugarloaf mountain -- and I took her!
And that was the moment I realized it was a children's birthday party.
Lucky shot. I was aiming for the leprechaun.
Took it with my Myth & Wesson
I bagged that one in the Sixties on an acid trip.
Next I'm hunting for a politician that tells the truth.
Damned if I know. We were all stoned at the time.
To this day, I still find glitter in the back of my truck.
I think it really proclaims to the world what a total asshole I am.
I rode that merry-go-round for two days before I got a clean shot.
He was standing in the clearing with a principled Republican, so I decided to shoot the less-endangered one.
To kill it, you have to believe in it first.
There's an interesting story behind where I got that clock.
I got that one last year in Narnia.
If you wear rainbow camouflage they never see you coming.
That’s a misconception. They’re all over the place out in Silicon Valley.
It was a good thing I had my glitter gun.
So much for that fairy tale ending
Wow! So that clock is made of real mahogany?
I’m banned from the carousel in the park for life but it was worth it.
Yes, but to be honest my daughter already hated me.
The magical and enchanting unicorn appears to only a rare few and has the ability to bestow magic, miracles and wisdom to those who are pure of heart and virtuous in their deeds. So, I shot it.
For that one I needed a hunting license AND a poetic license.
Yeah. My bad.
Wait til you see my honest politician in the next room.
It turns out there is a magic bullet.
The mythical creature permit was surprisingly easy to get under the Trump administrations new rules for fake animals.
My granddaughter’s 6th birthday party didn’t go quite as expected.
I told my daughter that if she didn't eat her vegetables, a unicorn would die. She eats them now.
This one we bagged on one of our LSD trips.
Yes, NOW there's no such thing as unicorns.
I haven't seen one of those since Woodstock.
Turns out there was one.
My daughter hasn't spoken to me since.
My wife thought the room looked too masculine.
To this day I’m not allowed within 300 feet of a merry-go-round, but it was totally worth it, don’t you think?
Ed was a remarkable horse in so many ways. More than anything he loved drag, so when he went we knew we had to so something fabulous.
Endangered is a thrill, but mythical really gets the old ticker pumping.
Entirely legal. Pruitt took them off the rare and endangered list.
I'm tellin' you. The whole trip was just magical.
Trump administration lifted the ban.
And that's why my daughter hasn't spoken to me in thirty years
They're only endangered if you actually believe in them.
You don’t know what true fear is until you’re staring into the eyes of Princess Rainbow Sparkles from 20 feet away.
Yes, finding a Unicorn is more likely than winning the New Yorker Caption Contest.
You toss out a handful of Skittles in the right spot, and they just come running.
His trophy wife is fake too.
I bagged that one on a four-day acid trip back in '67.
The first and last one cost me $85,000. The one in the middle cost me my grandkids.
That one was once the mascot of Trump University.
What he was doing in my pajamas, I’ll never know.
Lost my trophy wife over this.
well now they don't exist
The horn was added postmortem so my neighbor wouldn't figure out what happened to his horse.
Yes, they do exist. Sorry, 'did'.
Of course it's fake, but the Base thinks it is real.
Needless to say, they'll never let me back on that carousel
I had the horn added later just to mess with my kids.
Turns out they weren't actually extinct. They are now though.
Well, they did exist.
There’s a really interesting story behind how I came to be in possession of that clock, if you have a few minutes.
LIMERICK: "I shot this magical beast...It made for a wonderful feast...Why should I mind,..If its the last of its kind...I'm an asshole, and don't care in the least."
I don't know what you put in this drink, George, but if you don't mind, I'd like another.
The day after Trump lifted the ban, I was on a plane.
Of course, they'll never let us on that merry-go-round again.
Of course, my position on unicorns has evolved since then.
I was saving that spot for a picture of an ethical Republican President but settled for something more abundant.
Difficult to find, and even harder to find a good recipe for.
Not an easy shot. The carousel, it keeps going round, you know.
Turns out they’re real...and delicious.
Yes, extrememly rare. Central Park carousel 1874.
I couldn’t believe it, so I just shot it.
Is that a cow up there? You shot a cow?
Woodstock, in '69. Haven't seen one since then.
Fake Gnus
That's correct: they don't exist... anymore.
Finally, my horn section is complete.
I must take you hunting there. It’s unreal.
Everyone asks about the clock.
That's nothing. You ought to see my butterfly collection. Ever heard of Tinkerbell?
Running over the horse was an accident. Gluing a horn on his head, now that was genius.
Yep, Amazon...
When I pulled the trigger, I knew it was either hit or myth.
And in the next room I have functioning congress.
Surprisingly, not covered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
That was the day my daughter stopped talking to me.
Funny story, I was aiming for the Leprechaun.
Much to my surprise, gentlemen, a lot like chicken.
Difficult kill. Damn thing kept going up and down and around and around.
I thought it was a deer until it farted a rainbow.
The only thing that stops a magical beast with a horn is a good guy with a gun.
Admittedly, my taxidermist has been known to use artistic license.
It's fake, of course, but it sure keeps the grandchildren quiet.
The taxidermist cried the whole time
...and than he said "you can't shoot me, I don't exist".
You wouldn't believe the amount of glitter in those things...
Yeah well, it was the sixties and we were out hunting on acid.
Well, it's extinct now.
Don't get him started. It's a neverending story.
Here, gentlemen, are the results of two African safaris... and one wild ride on a carousel.
Isn't that clock an hour ahead?
This taxidermy display offends me almost as much as that horse's ass in the White House.
Got that one tripping' in the sixties !
..but of course, we give a lot to conservation.
When did you say the bad luck started?
Got 'em with my glitter gun.
Where did Frank say he went on his last safari?
I followed it's glitter trail for over 4 miles before i cornered it under a rainbow.
And this one died when I grew up.
After wiping out the endangered species, I was forced to hunt those that never existed.
Yes. Sixty years ago my imaginary friend shot this one.
"And the Maiden riding her became my trophy wife".
The meat tastes like cotton candy and snow cones, with a hint of marshmallow.
That animal on the right . . . . Did you shoot a cow?
They also said evidence of collusion with the Russians doesn't exist.
Yup, you're an Asshole.
I didn't see it myself until I believed it.
This clock belonged to my grandfather.
I don’t like to make too much of it, but let me just say — that carousel was moving really fast!
My daughter hasn't spoken to me since.
My granddaughter still isn't speaking to me.
Naw, it's really Nelly, our old mare. I got the horn from Amazon.
My other hobby is to take candy from children.
Hey Bill, what’s in these drinks!
Is that clock right?
Do you know how hard it is to find a taxidermist in Narnia?
For the record, it was strictly self defense.
...and I got this one pretty cheap since it’s missing a horn.
I got lucky. It was the last one.
Bagged that one in Narnia.
Fake Gnus
It was actually left in my bed by the Fairy Godfather.
Relax, I got it from IKEA.
It turn out there is, in fact, a magic bullet!
I shot that one in Haight-Ashbury in the late 60's
I didn't think Trump would win, either.
Fox News blames Obamacare for their extinction.
I figure, why limit myself to fantasy football?
That's nothing, we're having mermaid for dinner.
Twenty-five years, and my daughter still hasn't forgiven me.
I got that one off of eBay along with a Certificate of Authentication.
The owner of the carousel was very upset.
He granted me three wishes. I never got the last two.
My granddaughter will be so excited to see this. She's afraid they're not real.
Since they don't exist, I don't have to feel bad about killing one.
Merry-go-round. Santa Monica Pier. 2008.
Mystical, yes,,,, but surprisingly slow.
We have those same candlesticks.
I'll never forget this hunt. It was magical.
So I guess you’re probably wondering about the gardens gnomes now.
I baited it with cupcakes, new-age music, and really positive vibes.
I thought I'd mythed.
No, I don't hunt. Turns out if you tickle 'em hard enough, the head falls right off.
I had it mounted years ago. I've just been keeping it in the basement until the girls went away to college.
Yeah, but my daughter wouldn't speak to me for months after that one.
I was banned from all Disney parks for life, but it was worth it!
I used a crossbow for the one on the left and a hunting rifle for the one on the right. For the one in the middle, I just stopped believing.
There was glitter everywhere!
Did I ever tell you why my daughter stopped talking to me?
Bagging her was actually easy. But the manager of the carousel put up one hell of a fight.
I don't think you can truly appreciate a rare and beautiful thing until you've killed it and mounted its carcass on your wall.
Honestly I did him a favor. Who wants to be the last of anything?
Yeah, we got real lucky. They say there was only one left.
Well, they may be mythical, but at least they're not endangered.
I bagged that one in my granddaughter's bedroom.
It was either a unicorn or an honest politician and I found the unicorn first!
I didn't want to kill it, but who would have believed me?
The taxidermist was a real wizard.
My granddaughter is not speaking to me.
Now, for sure, they don't exist.
I hated to do it, but there was only one left.
I was on safari with Timothy Leary.
Agreed. The LSD is kicking in.
"There's an imaginary penalty for hunting them.'
It didn't help at all, she actually wants to live with her mother even more now
But now it seems I'm on a hit list of a group of 11 year old girls.
Note the left-handed twist, which is quite rare.
Well, you’re definitely going to hell for that one.
The story behind this one is unbelievable.
Don Jr. shot him at the Pride Parade.
Turns out rainbows make terrible camouflage.
No, now they're extinct.
It was eating my roses.
Mr Trump said he shot that one himself
The rest is used to make glitter glue.
It comes down before the grand kids show up.
I know they say shoot for your dreams, Stewart. But, damn.
So tragic! I didn't recognize him in his Halloween costume.
My daughter still hasn't forgiven me.
It's a highly evasive species.
I was actually aiming for universal healthcare.
My last safari had a real fairytale ending.
Don’t ask, it was the sixties
I bagged this one on an acid trip.
I mean, amazon just has EVERYTHING.
They're real alright. It's the part about their poop tasting like ice cream that's the myth.
Why settle for being a jerk when you could be a monster?
Fortunately, the United States doesn't have an extradition treaty with Narnia.
Lucky for me, I got the last one.
I had two fantasies left: bagging a unicorn and winning the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest. Now there's only one mountain left to climb.
...and the one on the right is from a herd of fake gnus.
I see an antelope, a bull, and more bull.
I swear, Donald thinks it's real.
I bagged it in Narnia. The hard part was getting it through the wardrobe.
Bagged that one on an LSD trip.
I bet Don Jr would kill to have one of those.
That one I bagged from the merry go round at Coney Island.
Nice clock
There she was, right next to the jackalope.
Illegal? Nah... that’s just a myth.
The clock is actually handcrafted in Germany.
Damn thing was going around in circles when I shot it.
Imaginary, my ass.
Don't mean to brag, but my hunting skills are legendary.
Who shoots a bull? I mean, really.
Mythical. Didn't need a license.
One in a million, really. The carousel stopped for a split second, and I took the shot.
That damn carousel kept spinning, but I kept shooting. It was much easier once everyone jumped off.
Can you tell it’s a carrot?
I have Trump's Time Magazine cover around here too.
Luckily I had a magic bullet.
They don't stay rare by themselves.
It is fake. But you have to do something when you shoot your own horse.
I'm an asshole.
Buying the hunting permit was no problem once I'd purchased the ambassadorship.
They are remarkably fast and taste like cotton candy.
Finding an imaginary taxidermist proved to be quite difficult.
Surprisingly, it tasted like chicken.
My granddaughter is still not talking to me.
No, it was not a safari, but it was a carousel ride to remember.
Yeah, my daughter was pretty pissed.
They used to be rare, prior to Trump
Well... it beats my trophy wife!
Yes, I was lucky. I got the very last one.
I bagged that one on the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Then I thought to myself: What would Trump do?
I ruined the birthday party but it was sooo worth it.
In the end they dropped the charges but banned me for life from the Magic Kingdom.
It may be a fictional creation, but remember we ourselves are cartoon characters.
It is the only hunting story I have ever heard that begins with "Once upon a time..."
So I guess you’re probably wondering about the gardens gnomes now.
Of course my daughter doesn't see it that way.
I bagged them when the merry-go-round stopped.
Technically, I didn't break any laws.
When I smelled cotton candy, I knew we were downwind.
Lucky for me, the current administration lifted the ban on hunting them.
Still need the Yeti to complete the collection.
The hard part was finding a discreet taxidermist.
I know a guy who knows a guy in Narnia.
And I caught this one while tripping on acid.
They're as rare as moderate Republicans.
None of them are real. I just like making my nieces cry.
I was aiming for a deer but I mythed.
And then it granted me one wish.
I still don't see the elephant in the room.
Didn't taste the way you would think.
Sure, it might have been more ethical just to take a picture of it, but who believes pictures these days.
They really do sell everything at IKEA.
I lucked out, the Fish & Game guy said these things are mythical, don't require a license and there's no limit.
Endangered? No, that's a myth.
I bought it from a leprechaun in Utopia.
The one I got on safari had a bigger, much bigger horn. It was really big, very big - the biggest anyone has ever seen. I'm the only one who could bag one like that. Obama never got one anywhere near that big.
Well, if they did exist, they don't anymore.
What's even more unbelievable is the taste.
I bagged that one during an acid trip in 1967.
This one I shot just for my daughter, and of course she never appreciates anything I do for her.
Nice clock
I say, if it's not on the endangered list, it's fair game.
Well, I wanted a wolf but apparently they're endangered.
I wanted the lion, but the dentist got there first.
Just between you and me this middle one is paper mache.
What did Joanne put in this punch?
If they did exist , they don't anymore.
I wanted an elephant, but they're getting so hard to find.
My granddaughter still won't speak to me.
Guns don't kill unicorns. . .
Horse died of old age. I bought the horn on E Bay. It was his dying wish.
Things got out of hand at my granddaughter’s birthday party.
Let’s just say, my daughter still isn’t talking to me
And I bagged this one on an NRA sponsored acid trip.
Of course, the grandkids aren’t speaking to me.
It was that or a trophy wife - that's cheaper.
My guess is he was hunting in gnome man's land.
The one in the middle is fake news
No, they don’t really exist. Anymore.
This is my way of coming out.
Strangely, this time I felt both virile AND feminine.
It wasn’t about believing in him. It was about believing in myself.
They said unicorns were catch and release but I said, “Screw you, I’m American.”
My wife wanted to visit Narnia and I wanted a hunting trip. We met in the middle.
It was just too beautiful not to murder, decapitate and hang on my wall.
Yes, their tears can heal. I’m completely cancer-free now, but the biggest bonus was that when my wife saw this, she walked out on me. These things are truly magical.
And that’s why my wife calls me a killjoy
I was just following a trail of Skittles, and then there she was...
A decline in the number of carousels has greatly reduced their numbers.
I bagged that one on an acid trip in '68.
But the truly remarkable thing is that I got them all with my car.
Well the real kicker is that we're not real either.
I figured I'd get him before one of the Trump kids did.
I guess this explains that rainbow coming out of the chimney.
Took a lot of imagination to bag that one.
The unicorn population in Narnia was out of control.
Did you know a unicorn without testicles is called a "eunuchorn".
And that was the last time my daughter spoke to me.
Oddly enough, it tasted like chicken.
well now they don't exist
Hey !! Who dumped an ice-cream cone on its nose??
Yeah it was on Election Day. How'd you know?
It was a lucky shot, I was aiming for the Yeti.
Honestly, I’m more impressed that all three are level
Ah,yes. That was a magical day.
The hunt was unreal.
The big challenge was getting it off the merry go around undetected.
Do you know how hard it is to score a Unicorn permit?
Surprisingly it tasted pretty much like chicken.
Then I drank it’s blood and now I’m immortal. So...you wanna turn on the ballgame?
African Plains on the left, American Plains on the right, Astral Plains in the center !
Had to climb over a lot of little girls to get that one.
So, I'm thinking: what's more important, the loss of magic and wonder for all time or that spot over the mantle?
I shot this one in my sleep.
Real, fake — what’s the difference?
Getting him off the carousel was the toughest part.
Is it any more strange than having real animals on the wall?
It was born a unicorn. But it identifies as a deer.
The Unicorn ?? Its head was in my bed.
It was November 7, 2016 ... just before the election ... Had I known it was bad luck ...
It's not what you think. I bagged it on a carousel in Brooklyn.
We used glitter to lure her out of the forest.
And I thought I wouldn't enjoy my granddaughter's birthday party.
For the best big game hunting you simply have to go to Narnia.
Then it fell asleep on her lap. The rest you know.
Nah, it's not real. I just like to see my liberal friends' heads explode when they see it.
It did not go over well with the grandkids.
And that, gentlemen, is how I lost my dental practice.
Needless to say, my daughter hasn't spoken to me since.
It wouldn't get off my lawn.
They aren't that rare when you are on mushrooms.
It wasn't easy, by any stretch of the imagination.
After this one I had to close my dental practice.
Naww, just a horse in a party hat.
Of course, my grand-daughters won't speak to me anymore.
As a product of Kansas public schools, I say it's real.
At first I thought "this can't be real." But I shot it anyway, just to be safe.
That's Dick Cheney for you.
Correction: they used to exist.
Yep. Thought he could hide behind a rainbow.
Yes, it is from a Carrousel, but it still wasn’t an easy shot.
Let's just say my daughter's tenth birthday party was a mess.
Bagged that one in Narnia.
amazon prime
Turns out, if they aren’t real then they’re not on the endangered species list.
Endangered? No, that's a myth.
It was a magical night
I didn't believe in Donald Trump either!
I got that one during the safari I went on with the guys from my fantasy league.
I just followed the glitter.
Damn right it was the last one.
My granddaughters still aren't talking to me.
I bagged that one on Fox News' Alternative Safari.
It was the last one in the world so I killed it while I had the chance.
Being on the board for Disney has some unbelievable perks.
Hmm. Seems like your clock is a bit slow.
It was fate. I was standing standing in just the right spot when the carousel stopped.
Usually I hunt for sport, but the unicorn was just a jerk.
Yeah, I was hunting somewhere over the rainbow when I saw her.
Its a trophy from the Ken Kesey collection...
I told you his hunting stories are more fantasy than fact
If the internet hated it when I shot that lion, they're gonna fucking hate this.
Carousel. New Jersey.
Say, is that mantel clock an 1874 Waltham?
No...this kind of trophy hunting saves the unicorns.
I've developed a really wild story over the years, but to tell you the truth, my wife bought it at Party City.
I got there before Don Jr.
That was the from the Flat Earth Society big game hunt.
Hey, if I hadn't shot it, some other self-indulgent rich guy would have.
Bagged that one at the Central Park Carousel
It appeared from nowhere while I was eating mushrooms.
We thought we'd shoot that unicorn before they become extinct.
Yes, they do fart cotton candy when stressed.
Legendary? Well, now they are.
I’m starting to think some of these trophies might be fake
And this one I shot at my neices third birthday...
Alright, NOW they're extinct.
And this is Princess Celestia from ‘My Little Pony’, she didn’t go down easy.
I shot this one in James Thurber's backyard.
The Care Bear got away
Screw 'em, since they claim it doesn't exist they can't claim it's endangered.
My daughter asked for a pony, so I said, 'I'll do you one better'
I bet that clock’s a one in a million antique.
They might be rare, but they are damned easy to track. Just follow the rainbows.
Now I'm enchanted forest public enemy number one.
The one in the middle is actually a horse. We had the taxidermist add the horn so that our dinner guests wouldn't get upset.
And that's when she stopped calling me Daddy.
You should've seen the taxidermist's face
Of course things were different before the Endangered Species Act.
I understand that either Eric or Donald, Jr. shot her at Fantasyland on safari in Orlando.
That one came from James Thurber's estate sale.
My daughter bagged that one, the day after she discovered boys.
Well, they're not officially endangered, you know.
Tracking down that one took a LOT of imagination.
From the clock store on 5th street
So, that's why the steaks were pink.
Oh, it had always been a fantasy of mine.
That was during the '60s. Need I say more?
No, our decorator just sawed it off a carousel.
You eat my hostas, you hang on the wall.
What’s in this tea?
I shot this one in my sleep.
The downside is that I’m no longer Olivia’s “favorite Pop-Pop.”
Your clock is running a bit slow.
... and thus ended my childhood
My daughter still won't talk to me.
My wife says I ruined our daughter's sixth birthday party, but it really completes my collection.
Most of my buddies hunt for a trophy wife. I wanted something more ... unique.
This vintage Howard Miller mantle clock was really a find.
Unisex, Obviously
To those who thought they were extinct, now you're right.
It was a magical day.
I shot that one at my granddaughter’s fifth birthday party.
Actually, they’re fairly common on merry-go-rounds.
How was I supposed to know it was endangered?
It turns out there is a magic bullet.
Don Jr. and Eric know how to thank a big donor
Actually I was hunting for my little pony.
It's been 20 years and my daughter STILL won't speak to me.
One day, I'm gonna hunt down a Care Bear.
The Trump boys can help you hunt even the most endangered of species.
It's put a real chill on relations with the grandkids.
It took me four hits of acid to finally bring her down.
And now, under this administration, it's completely legal!
Sure, it cost my daughter years of therapy, but it was worth it.
I bagged that one when the carousel closed.
Bagged on my last acid trip!
She died of natural causes at the end of the Age of Aquarius.
Mermaid's in the next room.
Don't tell the other hunters, but I made it with a 3D printer.
Finding it was easy. The real challenge was cleaning up all the glitter.
I usually use a Remington 30-06 but for the unicorn I used my imagination.
So, yeah, as you can see, I'm going to Hell.
Surprisingly , they’re not on the Endangered Species list. You can shoot all you can find.
Took me three shots - darned thing kept bobbing up and down and going in circles...
I see you killed your daughter's dreams.
And yet the most implausible aspect of this scenario is the black guy to my left.
They're actually pretty lax about hunting licenses in the Enchanted Forest."
They're pretty to look at, but they're actually invasive.
Of course, you have to believe in unicorns before you can shoot one.
I didn't really shoot him. The rainbow fell on him and I just had him stuffed.
No, that’s from a merry-go-round.
Yeah, I thought about it, but then I said "What the hell".
Yeah, but my granddaughters will never speak to me again.
My Little Trophy
OK, OK, it's a horse -- and a damn good taxidermist.
I killed that one when I was a nine-year old girl.
I thought the room could use a little sparkle.
So Bigfoot sees my hunting rifle and says to the Unicorn, "I only have to be faster than you." And he was.
What better way to prove they existed?
I think you should avoid social media for a while.
Ethel was driving, and he literally came out of nowhere.
Bought her at an auction. They said Michael Jackson only rode her on weekends.
The glitter got everywhere.
Tried for years to bag a progressive republican... but, I'm pretty sure they're just a myth...
I got him in my sights – it was hit or myth.
Quite a catch! Although much harder to sneak him off the merry-go-round than you might think!
PETA can't protest it if it ain't real.
Unicorn?! Heavens no. It’s a GMO horse.
Sure, I feel guilty sometimes ... then I remind myself that I'm too rich to care.
They’re not as friendly as you think.
Most people only chase their dreams...
It was a challenge because the carousel was moving.
Of course, my daughter doesn't talk to me anymore.
Well Bill, they're a myth now!
My daughter still won't speak to me.
Turns out my daughter didn't want it after all.
Yes at the time there were only two left, but I figured bag one before they're all gone
Trump says they are real.
This one was bequeathed to me by my fairy godfather.
The funny thing is I was shooting blanks.
My granddaughter loves them and I thought, why not?
The most difficult part was culling it from the merry-go-round.
Yeah, it's a great clock. I found it at Bill's Antiques on 4th Street.
...incredibly rare, but Eric Trump shot it anyway.
The kid on the carousel made a scene when I bagged that one.
It was easier than finding a trophy wife.
Funny thing is, I was aiming for My Little Pony.
My granddaughter no longer speaks to me, of course.
The funny thing is there are no prohibitions against poaching imaginary animals.
They're emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage, which is why my wife killed it.
Nope, those are her real eyelashes.
Believe it or not, it was the least preposterous game at Mar-A-Lago.
I've always been guided by the words of our commencement speaker, who told us to go after our dreams.
We got this one on our dream vacation.
They say they don't exist, and I made sure of that.
Yep, I had to beat out the Trump boys for that one.
I waited for the carousel to come to a complete stop and then: Bang!
That one really upsets the grand-kids.
Ironically, I was hunting an entirely different endangered species at the time.
Let’s just say my daughter still doesn’t speak to me.
And Donald Trump was elected president.
Have you not read "The Trump Sons' Rules of Hunting"? When you see something rare and beautiful -- hunt it, kill it, and mount it on your wall.
It took one shot to dispel centuries of myth.
Where did you say you bagged the middle one again Mr. Cheney?
And yet, I've never found Jesus.
I got it with a virgin and an AR-15
Sat under a rainbow for three days before she appeared.
Thankfully, I realized that I hadn't shot a rhino, which are so rare.
It was magical, but also a little gamey.
Well, I think the acid kicked in
Well, it's not as if they're a protected species.
Yep, that was quite a trip, if you know what I mean.
No, it's not an endangered species, it's an imagined species.
And with this, my special place in hell is secure.
Endangered? I thought they were non-existent.
My wife won't speak to me now, so it was worth it.
I shot him at Disney World.
Finally, I'm free of the elephant in the room.
How I bagged that one is a Grimm story.
It's like the horn follows you around the room.
Some old myths die harder than others.
Fortunately there's no law protecting mythical species.
It's my first 1-pointer.
Bagged this guy on a Merry-Go-Round in Atlantic City.
I had to use my six year old daughter as a decoy to get this one!
Under this administration, it's open season on EVERYTHING!
Hard to find, easy to kill.
No, surprisingly it tasted more like leprechaun
You can only hunt it with glitter.
Well, now they they don't exist.
Well, I've got to be honest with you. It's a carrot.
After it granted me my third wish I shot it.
The custody hearings never went my way after that.
I’ll admit it – I was pretty high when I bagged that one.
How the hell did I know it was endangered?
An alternative fact animal but real nonetheless.
...and for this one, I used a 12-gauge Winchester Rainbow with glitter shot.
The hunt was legendary. I hit him in the fairy tail.
What'd you do with the rest of the carousel?
Santa's next.
Admittedly, this one's just a horse with a party hat, but I needed a centerpiece.
I had to close my dentistry practice after this one.
... And then I realized I was growing up, and could never return to Realm of Innocence again. So I figured, why not?
I keep the Tooth Fairy in the bathroom.
Well, it sure is mythical now.
And they say it doesn‘t pay off chasing rainbows.
She appeared when Trump took office. On my next hunt, I'm going after a flying pig.
You should’ve seen the centaur that got away.
...and then my daughter stopped asking me for things.
It was nothing compared to hooking that mermaid.
My daughter didn’t speak to me for six years, but it was worth it.
The tricky part was getting it through customs.
You should have seen the dragon that got away.
And that's the one I like to hang my hat on.
I had to go somewhere over the rainbow to get that one.
For some reason my granddaughter refuses to visit anymore
I'm not really in favour of letting our imaginations run wild.
Why are we still friends with this guy?
And I bagged that one on My Little Safari.
My granddaughter still won't speak to me.
That one I brought back from my acid trip.
I got some of these on safari trips, others on LSD trips
Oh, no, Foster's not a hunter. He works in our prop department.
For a nonexistent mythical creature, she put up quite a fight.
The hard part was finding and hiring a virgin to lure it in..
I bagged it in the '60s. It was a different time back then.
Turns out they’re not imaginary. They’re extinct.
Of course it's not real, but his hairpiece reminds me of Trump's.
It was so beautiful and life-affirming, I just had to have it.
Don Jr. said, "Go ahead, it's not like it's going to live forever!"
That was twenty years ago, and my daughter still isn't speaking to me.
It wasn't as easy a shot as you would think - that carousel was really spinning.
The hardest part was finding a virgin to go with me.
No, they don't exist... not anymore, at least.
I had no choice. It was attacking a snow leopard.
Extinct now.
Pink, fluffy, dancing on rainbows but no match for my daughter's AR15.
The steaks were magical.
I think it makes the room really pop
Endangered? They're practically nonexistent.
I traded Rudolph for this one
On the flip side, they don't bring the grandkids over as much any more
It turns out they weren't extinct—yet.
I know — I thought they were exstinct too. So I figured this was my one opportunity...
There was a fully grown human male inside.
Actually, I hit that one with my car.
Before you judge me, I didn't shoot it. It ran out in front of my truck.
He said he was the very last unicorn, but you know, they always say that.
Oh, it was an easy hunt, but the guy running the merry-go-round made it a true challenge.
My lord, would you look at that! It's already 1:45!
They say dreams die hard, but this one only took one shot.
I got it from a Creationist who swears on his bible that it is authentic!
After the first shot there was glitter everywhere.
The real myth is that they can sense danger before it strikes.
No, now they're extinct.
I've always wanted one, and the EPA says it's permitted now.
It was extreme hunting. First she granted my wish. Then I shot her.
Getting that kid off the carousel was my toughest challenge
I bagged that one at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch.
Not so magical now, am I right?
You killed a lot of dreams with that one.
Oh that one’s just to mess with my grand-daughter.
Here's the one Ivanka bagged.
I think we used too big of a screw.
I wasn't wearing my reading glasses-- I thought the bidding was for a Mountie uniform."
My daughter is still mad at me.
Never underestimate the power of a rainbow-glitter gun, my friends.
Fake endangered species.
They're actually pretty easy to bag. The hard part was getting a hunting license in Narnia.
I bagged that one in Silicon Valley when it leapt out from behind a rainbow.
I was banned from Disneyland for life for that one.
So graceful, so magical...I just had to shoot her.
It was a fantasy of mine
I shot that one at Toys-R-Us.
I killed the left and right ones on my African trip, and the middle one on my LSD trip.
It's not real. Anymore.
My daughter hasn't spoken to me in 6 years.
Eighteen-inch high-horn. Shot with a glitter gun on my artistic licence. Gave the meat to the elves.
They're not so much imaginary as they are extinct.
I just need a Pegasus to complete the collection.
A little gaudy for my taste, but I shot it for the grandkids.
It turned out my granddaughter wanted a live unicorn. She doesn't visit much anymore.
...and I caught this beauty while testing out my new rifle on LSD
I had to wear rainbow camo to get close enough to this one.
I had to use my imagination to bag that one.
My granddaughter, of course, is no longer speaking to me, but it was worth it.
Where do I begin. Once upon a time in a land far , far away......
I know what you're both thinking, but it helps with population control in Narnia.
On the plus side — it does add a lot of color into the room.
...and I bagged this on an acid trip back in the '70s.
I prefer to mix fantasy with reality, just like the current administration.
You should play the lottery. Trump was elected president and you bagged a unicorn.
It was very simple, I used a rainbow.
Of course it's fake, Dale.
My hunting guide said "Try this little pill." And I did.
The one with the wings got away .
Let's just say that I got that one in the sixties.
Turns out they're not covered by the Endangered Species Act.
I was lucky to get it. It was the last one.
So, just the one then?
I shot two in Africa and one on the carousel at Coney Island
It's amazing how impressed people are until they find out it's just a snow-cone I glued on.
They say they're magical but the taste is just so so
Despite what you may have heard from the Mainstream Media, these things are vicious killing machines.
It cost me my soul, but isn't she magnificent!
It looked better than it tasted.
Is that an original Hermle mantelpiece clock?
That one I took down at the 65th Street Carousel in Central Park.
It must have taken a lot of imagination to chase that one down.
No, if it's mythical it can't be considered endangered.
It was a dream vacation.
Too much?
Now this one comes with quite a story.
I bagged this one on a merry-go-round.
It was a mystical, magical experience. Then I shot him.
I think we're cursed now, but it looks good on the wall.
I was aiming at Bigfoot.
Tricky shot, that one, considering the speed of the merry-go-round.
People think it’s a unicorn, but that’s just how it’s attached to the wall.
My daughter is 36 and she still hasn't forgiven me.
1969, San Francisco, LSD
...and was my daughter pissed!
I was under some pressure. Jones, next door, has a Sasquatch mounted over his fireplace.
My granddaughter hasn’t spoken to me since.
The toughest part was timing the rotation of the carousel to get a clean shot.
It's a bit of a disappointment. We were hunting for Sasquatch.
Well actually I'm just the proud Grandpa... our little princess bagged it.
I didn't have a choice. Its last words were 'The NRA is a terrorist organization'.
She charged. It was a near myth.
I'm only a Sasquatch away from the magical Big Five.
So I said, "Mythical creature my ass"
Man...I love mushrooms...
Technically it’s not an endangered species
If you like this one, you should see the mermaid in our fish tank.
I poached the water buffalo in India, the impala in South Africa, and the dumb, rainbow, goat-horse looking thing I shot at my own daughter's birthday.
Some say Unicorns don't exist, so I hunted down the last one to prove them wrong.
It wasn’t the LSD after all.
Goes to show, no one is enforcing the Endangered Species Act.
I had to kill it with kindness.
Took me a while to scratch this one off my bucket list.
It's still only a one-point buck.
As soon as Trump took them off the Endangered Species List, I bagged one.
Coney Island Carousel , June 1976.
Yeah, a new thing: safaris for little girls. My eight year old loved it.
It's amazing what 3-D printers can do now.
Field dressing was the strangest part...rainbow everywhere!
Haven't seen one of them since the 60's.
The Trump administration really relaxed the hunting laws.
The downside is that my granddaughter has disowned me.
Everything else was extinct.
We worked out sort of a compromise. I didn't shoot her. And she agreed to pose there from nine to five, four days a week.
Whadda ya mean "there's nothing there"?
She said, ‘this deed shall carry a terrible curse,’ but honestly, I feel pretty good.
I never saw one until Trump was elected.
It was the 70's. What can I say?
I had a trophy wife but thought it would be tacky
That reminds me of our trip to Burning Man.
I originally wanted a rhino's horn but do you know how hard it is to find one?
I took it out of storage the moment my daughter left for college.
At first I had my doubts about a merry-go-round safari.
You could argue that this is proof that unicorns don't exist, at least anymore.
There I was alone in the woods with my gun and a fist full of psilocybin mushrooms.
I'm not exaggerating when I say the guy running that merry-go-round put up a heck of a fight.
So what's the big deal, it's only a one pointer?
Sure my daughter will be in counseling for years, but, hey, when you got the shot...
It's great living in an era when they've loosened gun AND drug laws
To be honest, I was aiming for the Pegasus.
My wife said she wanted to put a little magic back in our relationship. Turns out she meant something else.
I bagged this beauty at my niece's birthday party.
1. Yea, hunting on LSD, what was I thinking? 2. Phyllis doesn’t let the grandkids in here
Yes, I'm damed for all eternity, but then the blood of the innocent gives me eternal life, so it's a wash!
I bagged him during the blizzard of '06. My Land Rover slid off the road and struck a carousel.
Strangely, he said he didn't think humans really existed. I think he's pretty sure now.
It was advertised as a Fantasy Safari.
Then I had a second thought, "What the heck, I am a Republican after all."
Bagged that one at a Toys R Us in Trenton....
Not exactly a fairy-tale ending, was it Stan?
No - actually my Daughter bagged that one at her last slumber party.
Rainbows are the best bait but virgins will work in a pinch.
I nailed him at a merry-go-round.
Nerf gun, 100 yards. Close one! She was prancing right at me.
That beauty put me in the NRA Hall of Fame
This was the same day I met your mother.
We try to keep the kids out of this room.
Yep, killed it with kindness.
Without hunting, their populations would just grow out of control.
Well, I needed a hobby after I retired from lobbying.
I got that one right before carousels went extinct
Then it spoke to me about destiny or something like that. I don't know, I just shot it
That? That was a "thank you" from Don, Jr. and Eric.
It's not real, it's just combed over from the back.
That was the very last time my daughter came with me on a hunting trip.
Now that's a trophy you can hang your hat on!
Well, after the divorce, my daughter asked for a ‘My Little Pony,’ and I thought ‘You know what? I’ll do you one better.
Of course, I have to hide it when the grandkids are over.
Well, they don't exist anymore.
And I bagged that one at my granddaughter's 5th birthday party
Up until the end, it insisted that it was a figment of my imagination.
And here we have an alternative fact
With all the hoopla these days about guns, I killed this one with fairy dust.
I haven’t seen the grand kids in years. Why do you ask?
I bagged that one in Neverland.
Actually, that one I bought at a garage sale.
I wish I could elaborate, but the sixties were crazy.
Can you keep a secret? The middle one was out of season.
After just missing the centaur I was happy to bag this.
Surprisingly, unicorns are not on the endangered species list.
Shooting them is easy. Finding them is tough.
Yeah, Scott Pruitt allows them to be hunted now.
Turns out my granddaughter wanted a plush one instead.
Technically, it wasn’t on the endangered species list.
The guide said my hunting fees would fund their conservation.
The therapist said I needed to start confronting my internalized sense of toxic masculinity.
He was hiding in a patch of rainbows and butterflies.
I sprinkled a mixture of innocence and childhood dreams at the base of the rainbow, then waited with my AR.
This one's kind of a blur. Bagged him near Woodstock in '69 I think.
Yup... bagged that one on the Central Park carousel running at top speed.
I nabbed this one at Emily’s 7th birthday party.
I spared her from the misery of children's television.
Mythologically, it's not murder.
I bagged those two on a safari, and that one on an acid trip.
I had to kill my childhood fantasies the day I went into finance.
Did I every tell you about my safari to Narnia?
I didn't find the horn unusual, but then he said my name out loud . . .
I got everything I wanted from my first two wishes.
The hardest thing was getting the virgin to help.
Yeah it's sad, but the steaks were out of this world!
My daughter never forgave me.
With the glitter and rainbow camouflage, she never saw me coming.
In my defense, she was wearing a hoodie at the time.
Once I lured her into reality she was fair game.
I bagged it at my daughter's fifth birthday party.
You have to believe it to see it!
Actually, it's not a vestigial horn. It's a party hat.
I tracked him over the rainbow to where blue birds fly.
Actually, it tasted more like Spotted Owl.
...and this one I shot on a hallucinogenic trip in the 70's
My complete set of Care Bears is in the other room.
Greenpeace wasn't thrilled about this one.
And the one in in the middle I shot in 1969 while I was doing acid.
Got that one at my granddaughter’s birthday party in Jersey.
The matching rainbow is in the garage.
Yeah, it was the last of it's kind and I shot it. Tell me it's not a great country!
Wow, shot through the forehead with an ice cream cone!
Wasn’t so lucky after all ...
The hardest part has been explaining this to my granddaughter.
The other end dispenses artisan spices and ice cubes.
There were two. Some guy named Noah rescued the other one
I thought better about posting this one on Facebook.
Now of course back when I killed it, these things were everywhere!
Hopefully she is done with her “My Little Pony’, phase now.
You're right, Jim. The view is much better on this side of the exhibit.
It's really just a donkey, but you know how I like to embellish.
Finally I understand why his seven year old daughter broke all his golf clubs.
My granddaughter keyed my Mercedes.
Yes, I am estranged from my daughter.
Magnificent shot, museum quality mounting but maybe we should rejoin the ladies? I believe they have stopped screaming now.
There was a point when dentistry wasn’t enough.
Eric and Donald Jr. couldn't be more thrilled. It's not just an endangered species; it's the last of its kind!
My granddaughters haven't spoken to me since.
3-D printer, a drill bit, and shoe polish.
It's about as real as the democratic processes.
It was just after that I got my A rating from the NRA
We nabbed that beauty in the year of magical thinking.
So my wife said: there are more chances of you hunting an unicorn that our son finding a job
Bittersweet...my granddaughter has stopped speaking to me.
Little Chloe wasn't too happy about that one, but I told her it was being mean to the other unicorns.
And this one here is why my grandkids hate me.
The grandkids were surprised, but not in the way I expected.
Maybe I shouldn't have. Turns out to be much rarer than I thought.
Had to shoot it. Blasted animal never stopped talking.
Well, I thought it was a rhino.
You're not really rich until you've killed an imaginary animal.
I took first place in my fantasy hunting league.
So this is how I got my kids to stay out of the den.
Before you cook the meat, you have to carefully pick out the sparkles.
Isn't she a beauty, she was my first carousel ride.
My granddaughter doesn't talk to me anymore.
My daughter cried for days, but it really does tie the room together.
My granddaughter hates me.
I'm not into mythical but it kind of rounds out the collection,
Not to worry; it's never been listed on the Endangered Species Act.
The hard part was finding a virgin who didn't care about the Endangered Species Act
I tell ya, that day was magical
I didn't shoot that one. It died of apoplexy when Trump was elected president.
Honestly, I just don't care that this created a special place in Hell for me.
Comes in handy for ring toss.
And this trophy was taken down at my granddaughter’s birthday party.
Yup, I guess I over-reacted when they said I was too old to ride the carousel.
I bagged him on a Coney Island acid trip back in the 60's.
You'll never believe this: I woke up with that in my bed a few weeks ago.
It wasn't easy; I had to track him to the end of the rainbow.
There's an interesting story behind that one. Once upon a time....
I bagged this one on a Magical Mystery Tour.
That's nothing. You should see my Loch Ness trophy.
Hard to believe, but I think I got the last one.
My daughter bagged that one.
With the comb-over..you barely notice,
And I bagged that one at my five-year-old's Princess Party.
Obviously, fake Gnus!
Bought this one at a garage sale. Got it half off since its missing a horn.
Well, it was never listed as "endangered."
Its meat tastes like chicken, with a hint of pink gumdrop.
Trump is really rolling back restrictions on trophy hunting
It wasn't on the endangered list at the time.
It WAS magical. Until she started debating my Second Amendment rights.
Spotted this one running in circles on a playground in Jersey.
I normally use a rifle but this one I charmed to death.
And this one here I killed using only the power of my imagination.
. . . so, apparently I'm no longer welcome at the Twilight Sparkle Wildlife Preserve.
My granddaughter doesn't talk to me anymore.
Well, I realized no one would believe me ever again.
The kids wanted to go to Disney, but I wanted to go on safari, so we compromised.
It tastes just like Griffin.
I checked - they're not on the endangered list.
I bagged the first one in Zambia, the second in Fantasyland and the last at the Borden Dairy.
This one here I got during a mushroom binge at Woodstock.
'That was long ago when I still believed.'
That one took first place in my fantasy hunting league.
I bagged that middle one off the carousel in Coney Island.
That unicorn's horn is fake. The real one was ground up and sent off to battle E.D. in China.
But it never did solve my impotence.
I let her give me one last wild ride, and then...they shut down the carousel.
I just followed the rainbow poop.
It was a carousel in Tasmania. With, I have to say, a pretty grumpy operator.
I don't understand why everyone is so upset, its not on the "Endangered Species" list.
It’s a rhino ... I shot him on Halloween.
It was a Mid Summer Night Dream.......
She gave me one wish so I asked for her head.
Once he lifted the ban on trophies, suddenly it wasn’t enough just to kill the dreams and aspirations of the younger generation.
It was the sixties. I was on mushrooms.
The burgers were unbelievable
That was a gift from Scott Pruitt.
We know what happened that day, don't we Princess?
Up to her last moment, she almost had me convinced she didn't exist.
And they said it could only be caught by a virgin.
apparently, being mythical is no protection
My kind of wall is to promote diversity.
Wow. When you said you bagged a unicorn I just assumed it meant a new account.
It's really a Zebra. But a Taxidermist from the NRA, said he could keep me out of trouble.
Next fall I thought I'd change my game, and go sport fishing on Loch Ness.
I think the acid is kicking in
I got that one by following a trail of rainbow glitter.
Traditional weapons were ineffective, had to use social media.
That's a trophy from my one and only LSD hunting trip.
Like it? I got the very last one.
And this majestic specimen got me banned for life from the Pier 62 Carousel.
The rainbow piles make them surprisingly easy to track.
We had to take this one to the taxidermyth
If you think the head is unique you should have tasted the meat.
During my drug dependent phase, the unicorn was my emotional support animal.
Don't repeat this, but I touch up her eyelashes with my wife's mascara.
Actually, I was aiming for the centaur next to him.
Makes me wonder about that hole-in-one he claims to have shot too.
I acquired him from a fake hunting expedition website : don/eric.gov through my lawyer Michael.
There's big game, then there's "Fabulous" game.
That one charged my daughter on a merry-go-round.
... and next year it's open season on honest politicians.
Looks great now but the damn glitter made a helluva mess of the truck
It sure doesn’t help me get laid.
Yeah - but Disneyland banned me for life.
That clock is a minute fast.
I bagged that one on a '60's college acid trip.
It's a fake. But don't tell the Trump boys. They paid off on a huge bet.
Some say unicorn, I say fashionable elk
They said it was non-existent. Turned out it was just the last of an entire species. So, who looks stupid now?
No one was more surprised than me, I didn't think fantasy was my genre.
All the proceeds from the hunt went to for the preservation of endangered species.
My grandkids think I picked it up in Neverland but the truth is that I put it together from a kit.
If we all think she's sexy it's not weird, right?
Unfortunately, the sparkles vanished after I shot it.
Every so often, this one makes me feel a little guilty.
Yes, unicorns did exist.
You just had to one-up my leprechaun.
It was easy to track them in my sights since they kept going around and around in the same circle...
Shot 'er next to Bubble Gum River with a sawed-off candy cane.
It doesn't fool anyone. I taped a carrot to a horse's head.
It wasn't listed as endangered, so...
I told my granddaughter it was self-defense, but she still isn't speaking to me.
Thank God Trump lifted the ban on Unicorn Trophies.
Only ever saw the one.
And this is my fake gnus collection.
The kids have never forgiven me.
But I still don’t have a trophy wife!
Unfortunately, the virgin got away.
Once I crossed the rainbow bridge and found his candy poop trail I knew it was just a matter of time.
Of course, that was before Fish and Wildlife got a bug up their ass.
I climbed down off of Sparkle Pony and there, at the end of the rainbow, stood this magnificent creature. So I shot it.
I bagged the middle one after dropping some acid.
I tracked this one through 3 miles of glitter before I bagged him.
It’s a result of one of my first ‘trips’ in the late sixties
Which one did we just eat?
Fairy tales do come true.
Harry brought this back from the summer term at Hogwarts.
And wouldn't you know, it was the last one.
Yeah...that clock sure is beautiful.
That's from Eric Trump's 'Goodbye to Innocence' safari.
My theory is that they were hunted to extinction -- but it's only a theory.
He won the triple crown. Two races he won by a horn.
He was just sitting there making rainbows
Keeps the grandkids outta here. Bambi’s mounted in the billiard room.
Bagged him in the Haight in '68.
By the time I had it stuffed and mounted, my daughter had moved on to regular horses.
They should really take our guns away.
I've never made my dentist so jealous.
And that's a souvenir from Eric and Don Jr.'s recent visit to Disney's Magic Kingdom Animal Park.
Huh-only a 1pointer.
I figured I’d kill my daughter’s dreams early on.
It was magical.
I had to use pink marshmallow bullets.
You should have seen the Pegasus that got away.
You think these are rare? Try getting a hunting license for a leprechaun.
I bagged that one at a NRA "Ethics in Action" seminar.
When she started snortin' sparkles, I knew then it was either her or me.
Thank god for deregulation!
I know what you're wondering. It tastes just like chicken.
And then there was none.
Thank God you replaced that spotted owl you had here, the environmentalists were freaking out!!
A Narnian hunting license is pricey, but worth it.
Oh, Dick Cheney got that one.
The irony is I was out looking for Big Foot when I chanced across this beauty.
I got that one at little Samantha's birthday party last year.
Apparently, Silicone Valley is full of them.
Now that one really appeared out of nowhere.
I didn't expect to find him in my wildest dreams
Of course it's a carousel animal, but the other two are authentic according to Amazon.
Yes, I'm afraid this is all that's left from my first IPO.
Dave's fake game trophies always create an awkward atmosphere. Wait till you see the elephant in the other room
No one feels the sadness of extinction like a hunter.
For me, this was a real fairy tale ending.
And, I bagged that one at FAO Schwarz
Sure, the kids think they're cute, but you should see what they do to the azaleas.
Little Sally never hears about this, understood?
Interesting story, I got him with my unicycle.
Lucky for me, this one's magic powers were limited to card tricks.
My daughter likes unicorns so I thought she would love it - Surprisingly not.
Getting that one was a fantasy come true.
But at heart, I'm really a unicorn conservationist.
... and I bagged this little fella at my granddaughter's eleventh birthday party.
My wife made me take the centaur down.
They don't exist ANYMORE
No, I didn't shoot this one. It just turned up in my bed one morning after I refused to cast Johnny Fontaine in a fantasy epic.
My daughter’s first kill when she was 12.
Rare?! Oh my yes, with curried new potatoes and spring greens!
I see you're now hunting in theme parks.
Well, I had to shoot it just to prove that they did once exist.
A myth? Well, they are now.
A prime example of fake gnus.
I bagged that one in Never Never land.
And even better, I made unicorn jerky.
My daughter now regrets taking me as her plus one to the enchanted forest.
It was an unbelievable shot.
This one? Self-defense. The Carousel was headed straight for me.
I'll tell you, bagging that baby was like something right out of a fantasy.
Some enjoy the thrill of the hunt, but I prefer the fantasy of it.
Mounting this one was relatively easy. The centaur is another story.
"Not surprisingly, the Trump administration lifted the ban on killing and importing unicorns".
Pure luck...I was taking a hit-and-myth approach that day.
Yes, it had been a dream of mine since I killed my first Easter Bunny.
Most people thought it didn't exist. And now it doesn't.
“Yeah, the North Korea safari was nothing like I expected”.
And this is the reason Susan lives with her Mom now.
Suddenly, he emerged out of nowhere!
There it is. The last unicorn in Silicon Valley.
That was a magical hunting trip.
A guy in our hunting party wanted to sell the horn on the black market, but I’m too much of a conservationist for that.
It wasn't easy. I had to beat out Donald Jr. to get it!
"Since I shot it, half my hair fell out, I lost my job, and my wife left me. And then the meat spoiled in the freezer.
I figured it was time for my daughter to grow up.
They had to shut the carousel down for two days.
No, I have no family. Why do you ask?
I bagged that one at FAO Schwartz
My granddaughter is still not talking to me.
Another example of Fake News.
Of course, I had to tell my kid it ran away.
They taste a bit like chicken...with a splash of magical goodness...
So you had asked earlier about the glitter gun...
We had to use the world's last virgin princess as bait... finding her was more difficult.
I bagged that one when I was just five, on safari at Coney Island.
Don’t worry, no one knows it exists, so it’s not considered endangered.
He didn't see me in my metaphor camouflage.
Either appeal to kids or the sport dies out in a generation.
It was the last one. I had to have it.
Best merry-go-round ride ever!
... got that one on a bad acid trip in 1963.
My daughter doesn't speak to me.
Hired it for my daughter’s birthday party and couldn’t help myself.
Most unicorn hunts don’t end with a trophy.
Did I stop to think about it? Of course not, I might've missed the shot.
Serengeti,hell no I bagged him off the carousel at santa cruz boardwalk !
I had to, or you wouldn't have believed me.
Truth be told, I bagged that from a merry-go-round in Milwaukee.
So our lil' Suzie started therapy this week.
Once in a lifetime indeed. And my granddaughter hasn't spoken to me since.
And THIS is when being a 75 year-old virgin finally paid off!
I got him just before he jumped over the rainbow.
I didn't shoot her, she just magically appeared there one day.
Ah, ok. Now I'm stoned.
You don't see many of these party animals anymore
I take it down whenever my grand daughter comes to visit.
I know we're all here drinking his scotch, but doesn't Don Jr. get on your nerves sometimes?
On the outskirts of Universal. Looking for a mate, I guess.
My granddaughter won't talk to me now.
I was really lucky. I got the last one.
What about the one in the middle, John? Did you kill that one as it fiercely charged at you too?
It was a magic bullet.
Doesn't seem so magical now, does it?
Mythical my ass!
Even more impressive is the mermaid in the study.
That was a hell of an acid trip, boys.
Since we have run out of endangered species, I have had to move in to mythical creatures.
...so even though the genie called me despicable, he said he'd still give me three wishes.
I don't believe in leaving anything to the imagination.
It's rather enchanting, isn't it?
Tastes like chicken.
Bagged this one on a Safairy.
And you’re drinking her tears right now.
My granddaughter has disowned me.
You're right. A cursed existence IS a small price to pay for such symmetry.
Narnia. 1958. One shot.
It was a difficult shot, but somehow I knew I wouldn't myth.
The most satisfying moment was when it stopped sparkling.
It came to me in a dream. So, I shot it.
Fake.
Who knew it was an endangered species?
Oh, it's just a horse. I was running behind it with a javelin and it stopped short.
Apparently she wasn’t as magical as everyone thought.
Tasted just like regular horse meat, though.
My 9 year-old granddaughter bagged the middle one.
She really stood out from the herd.
Bet you can't tell which ones fake.
A toast, gentlemen, to a taxidermist with imagination!
When you're my age, the only sure shot is the carousel.
My daughter was pretty upset...
I’m particularly proud of my marksmanship on this one what with the merry-go-round was spinning full speed.
I didn't want my dream to die slowly. So I shot it.
It was a once-in-a-lifetime shot, so I took it.
Had to go round and round with that one.
My new taxidermist is a wizard
My granddaughter, bless her little pink heart, bagged it at morning recess.
I snagged this one on a psychedelic trip in 1964.
Crossbows beat rainbows every time.
To tell you the truth, it just jumped in front of me on the Turnpike before I could brake.
It was difficult, but 70 years of celibacy really paid off.
I went to bed with Stormy Daniels and woke up with that beside me.
So, I guess Brad's Disney safari was a success?
In the divorce, Judy took everything but my taxidermy and my hallucinogens.
My daughter still hasn't forgiven me.
Nasty things - one shot and there’s gumdrops everywhere.
I bagged that one, on a Safairy.
Here's where I get caught in a loop: if they don't exist, they can't be endangered. But if it's here, they have to exist.
We have to remove it each time our granddaughter visits.
It turns out that myths are not endangered.
Heather is 35 now and she still won't forgive me for that one.
A stroke of luck, I got the last one.
I bagged him on my last LSD trip.
Well. I guess they WERE real.
And I bagged this one during the revival of “Carousel.”
Last year's LSD trip.
Great Clock
The good news is that they're not endangered anymore.
Mother bagged it in the sixties, which were good to her.
She was much less elusive when the music stopped
Bagged that one on safari with my fairy godfather.
Nailed this one on an LSD expedition.
It cost me five ride tickets but it was worth it.
I followed the scat into my granddaughter's bedroom.
I bagged him on an acid trip in 1969...
The next room has the fake gnus.
Long story short, both the lion and the witch made me sell the wardrobe.
Yup. Unicorn hunting. Pretty much the only upside to being a virgin.
My taxidermist wouldn't stuff a narwhal so I kept the horn, shot a horse, and here we are.
I bagged two of them on my Africa trip, and the other on my LSD trip.
Yup, bagged that one in Narnia. Guess you could call it my little pony.
The others are from safari - this was bagged on a California acid trip.
"Unfortunately, it was both the first and last of its kind.
As real as our national integrity.
The Yeti is in the next room.
The carousel owner was not happy.
Shooting it was easier than believing it into existence.
Tastes like griffin.
I bagged that one on my last acid trip.
As he attempted to gore the leprechaun I took my shot.
That's nice, but it's only a one-point.
I dropped her with a 32-guage moonbeam.
And that is the elusive Equus monoclonius! I came across it chasing rainbows
Interesting side-note: My neighbors never had a backyard birthday party ever again.
My wife wants it there for the feng shui.
“Merry -Go -round owner musta had a fit !
What’s with the candlesticks?
After Cecil the lion, us dentists have had to up the ante considerably.
The challenge with this one was not hitting the kid who was riding it on the merry-go-round.
I had to drag home three from the Mar-a-Lago gift shop in order to get the IRS off my back.
I know it's a mythical beast, but I was amused by its presumption.
I'm not sure I can stay for dinner.
It's not endangered if it's not real
I don't know, guys. I'm starting to think I'm gay.
LSD actually sharpens my hunting prowess.
Did I mention I have an estranged granddaughter?
I'm a strong believer in diversity and inclusion.
That one cost me 10 years of therapy sessions for my daughter.
Well, it did grant me one wish...
What did he say was in this drink again?
But I never saw a taxidermist WEEP like that.
It was either him or my cynicism.
My grandchildren havn't spoken to me since.
My daughter has never forgiven me.
It’s actually a horse. I added the horn for the kids.
The taxidermist couldn't believe it, either.
A portion of the fees I pay to hunt and kill these magnificent animals goes to toward preserving them for future generations to hunt and kill.
Too bad they didn't make it on the ark.
I wonder if whoever was in the butt of the costume made it out alive...
We had to wait for my daughter to leave home before we could put it up.
Ivanka went with Don Jr. and Eric on their last trip to Africa.
It was the last of its kind, but fortunately for rich guys like me, Donald Trump removed it from the endangered species list.
Well as this was the last one we can take it off the endangered species list.
My daughter won't talk to me anymore, but it's worth it.
They really do poop soft serve ice cream, but if you can't breed them at scale the economics just don't work.
I didn't realize hunting had a fantasy league.
Yes, my daughter and I have been estranged for years. How did you guess?
I waited until I had my three wishes.
Believe it or not, an hour later I missed my shot at a flying pig.
And I landed this fine specimen at my niece's birthday party in Scarsdale.
I bagged the one on the far left on safari in Kenya in 1987, the middle one was the 2:45pm Disneyland Main Street Parade in '91...
It's like looking at a cartoon for a caption contest, scratching your head and wondering whether there is truly anything worth saying.
I thought he was simply glad to see me.
My five year old grand-daughter bagged her with her pink 9 MM semi-automatic.
And they said you shouldn't mix hunting and LSD.
She was so beautiful I didn't want to shoot at first, but I knew no one would believe me if I didn't.
My granddaughter no longer speaks to me.
I wanted something to match the griffin rug.
The mermaid trophy was scaring the children.
I bagged the Unicorn on an LSD trip.
Sure, that was the last one. But if I hadn't shot it, you never would have believed they existed.
What the hell, there was only one left anyway.
All this talk about their being endangered is just a figment of someone's imagination.
Got the last Minotaur, too. Wanna' see?
I was lucky. The park service said the herd needed thinning.
This is from that weekend in the fantasy camp.
And you'll never see another one, either.
I was aiming for the loudmouth leprechaun riding it.
My granddaughter bagged this one from the back of her little pony.
I was number one for eight weeks on the internet's most-hated list.
I bagged it, but it turned out my daughter meant a live one.
Tracked it all the way to the end of the rainbow.
That one's from the White House safari.
Oh no, I didn't believe it either until I shot it.
...and this one was gifted to me by Eric and Donald Trump Jr.
Yes... My granddaughter is quite the hunter it turns out.
And this one was from my trip to Antiquity.
Oh, that's my granddaughter's. She bagged it in the playground at P. S. 73 last summer.
I saw it and thought, "I'll be damned, that would really pull my living room together." Turns out I was right.
Don Jr. bagged this one.
Stuffing it was a nightmare - we coughed up glitter for a week!
Merry-Go-Rounds are great places to practice.
You could say I’m a giant asshole.
Is my drink too strong, or is that a unicorn on your wall?
Yeah,bagging that one was unreal.
My taxidermist worked for Disney.
If I didn't shoot it no-one would've believed me.
Yeah, I know they are supposed to be symbols of purity. Garbage. Before I bagged this last known unicorn, he cursed like a sailor and tried to stab me in the groin.
I guess now they don't exist.
I'll let you in on a secret... the eyelashes are fake.
Open season at the carousel.
Got this one on the Magical Mystery Tour.
You can’t see her if you don’t use your imagination.
Then I had the Enchanted Forest leveled, so this really is one-of-a-kind.
yup, straight to hell for me boys
...really it's about conservation.
It was a 'he,' actually.
At least with the Trump presidency, they're off the endangered list.
I don't think you should have your granddaughter's birthday party over here this year.
No, it's fake... but I still get offers on it.
I got that one from a carousel in Coney Island.
It was open season at the amusement park.
Well, it's not like it was covered by the Endangered Species Act.

It's unique and corny at the same time.

The tag suggest that they live in China.
Susie bagged that one when she was six.
Sure, there were some nasty tweets and my daughter isn’t speaking to me, but the RNC is begging me to return their calls.
The leprechaun head was too small to mount.
And when the narwhale drove its horn through my horse’s head, I thought, wow, would that ever make a statement.
Trump Tower had a garage sale and, well, we couldn't not buy it, could we?
Had to shoot her. No one would have believed I’d found her otherwise.
Yes, Jerry, I realize it is just a one point buck.
And that one I bagged in Silicon Valley
Near Three Mile Island, about 5 years after the meltdown.
I tell you, the hunt was just magical.
.. of course we take it down when the grandkids visit.
Mine's bigger.
Unfortunately for him, his ability to fart glitter and poop rainbows made him stand out from the herd.
That's a myth... It wasn't the last one.
No, I was just kidding. I don't really see a unicorn. What did you say is in this drink?
I never believed in them until I killed one.
The damn thing keeps getting glitter all over the carpet.
Don't tell the Trump boys I got it.
I sent the rest to the glitter glue factory.
And this one was in my last gay pride parade
Fox and Friends reported that these babies are everywhere these days.
My ten year old daughter bagged that one.
I think the eyelashes are fake.
The hardest part was getting the permit. They make you pay with leprechaun gold.
He came with his own hairbrush, but I've since lost it.
I shot a Leprechaun too but the taxidermist said he wouldn't stuff it.
..ah yes, that safari was truly magical.
And I bagged that one in '68, Coney Island, Madame Zee's skeeball palace.
Considering the glare of rainbow in my eyes and the rabid leprechaun biting my ankles, it was a helluva shot.
It was a hunt, sponsored by The Cloisters.
I think it was the last one.
I knew, if I waited, it would come around again.
Oh, I just went to the end of the rainbow.
There I am at the bar when in walks a Kudu, a Unicorn and a Water Buffalo, it made me laugh so hard I had to kill them all.
I shot it in my sleep.
This replaced a crucifix--the story is no less credible and a bit more fun to tell.
I nailed him eating a cupcake on a rainbow.
Picked her up at a tag sale in Narnia.
My most heroic achievement. I stole it from a carousel.
I call her 'My Little Phony'.
No, Jim. It's not a real one.
I can tell you one thing...you don't want to be running away from unicorn when it charges you.
And THIS is why we should abolish the 2nd Amendment!
Since my home address and photo are all over social media - I am the real victim here
Don Jr. and Eric said if I wanted that senior position at EPA that bagging this guy was the way to get it.
Reality isn't what it used to be.
I bagged this one in a dumpster after 'Carousel' closed.
Turns out you just need a normal hunting license
I asked her if she was game, and she said "yes," so I shot her.
They're said to symbolize purity and innocence. Nothing a 180-grain thirty-ought-six round can't handle, of course.
Yeah...i thought it was just a party hat.
Karen made me get rid of all my rifles. So now I'm super into Etsy hunting.

How can they want to take our guns?
Trump Jr. bagged this one to prove there are alternative facts.
Well, Bob's always been a bit of a dream killer.
His trophy wife did the decorating.
From a distance it looked like a Democrat.
It was a fantasy come true!
Sure I'm proud, but my daughter no longer speaks to me.
I bagged him up at the old Thurber place.
The Rainbow Blind was ingenious!
The hard part was finding the rainbow-colored camouflage outfit.
the gazelle in Ethiopia-- the water buffalo I tracked and killed in Zambia--I shot the My Little Pony in my daughter's bedroom
It took $20,000,000 of gene editing, but it was worth every penny.
And that was the day my daughter left me.
Between her and Bambi, I'm lucky to be alive.
That one ? Don Jr. sent me that when I told him his Dad would be indicted.
I bagged it on a Disney safari.
It's been forty years, and we're still vacuuming up the glitter.
You'll have to go into the back room to see the rainbow.
Bagging that trophy. was a fantasy come true.
My daughter is gonna be so pissed.
They said it didn't exist, which wasn't true before.
Actually, they're quite common in the Hamptons.
I tracked the carousel herd for days, until I had a clear shot.
And this one is from a shoot in 'La La Land'.
I told my daughter it was important to thin the herd.
They exist; but it’s certainly a myth that they can only be captured by a virgin.
I found Walt Disney World a lot less forgiving than Africa
My daughter isn’t speeking to me.
Yeah, my daughter still hasn’t forgiven me for that one.
Got lucky with this beauty, it was the last one left.
Still beautiful, but the magic is gone.
It's a mythical beast, of course. But then again, I've lived happily ever after.
If you like this, you'll love the family room. I've got some green alligators and long-necked geese, some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees.

It's fake, but it keeps the grand kids out of my man cave.
I followed the rainbow scat just as you instructed.
The Mrs. won't let me hang my leprechaun.

Yup, I bagged that one from a carousel in Binghamton, NY
We needed to thin the herd.
and I'm having Bigfoot stuffed for the den
Got that one on a magical mystery tour.
Next to last. I'm not a monster.
Endangered? No, it's only imaginary.
I picked up that one on the My Little Pony safari adventure.
Which reminds me, Carl, you going to make it to the Trump rally next week?
I guess at least one got on the ark after all.
Yep, I crushed the dreams of 10 million little girls. Worth it, right?
Yes, Narnia; one of the last hunting trips they allowed.
My daughter still isn't speaking to me.
It took years to find an actual virgin; after that, the rest was easy.
This was really a dream come true for me.
You can't even tell it's an ice cream cone.
At first I was ashamed. But then I thought, what the hell, I'll own up to it!
Bagged the middle one on Coney Island last month
I had to attend 158 birthday parties for five year olds before I finally bagged him.
My granddaughter hasn't spoken to me in two years.
Now THAT was a magical day!
My guide on that safari was Ken Kesey. My life has never been the same.
Finding the virgin, of course, was the hard part.
What a long, strange hunting trip that must have been.
It’s just a plastic mold, but the grandkids think I’m a wizard now.
I bagged those two and just outgrew the one in the middle.
So you have a 3D printer now?
Do I feel bad about it? Uh,yeah, sure.
Do you think this strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy?
My taxidermist gave me an unbelievable discount.
She has her mother's horn
I actually found this at Goodwill.
How will I ever confess to the grandkids that it's really white horse wearing a party hat ?
I thought my daughter would be thrilled, but, oddly, she was not.
We bagged that one on our safari to Narnia.
Two days of negotiation at a merry-go-round consignment shop in New Jersey.

And that one I bagged at Disneyworld.
Our club has always been in the forefront in promoting diversity.
I am so lucky that I got the last unicorn before they went extinct.
I bagged this beauty while on a lovely LSD safari
He tweeted this morning that he personally shot him
Fools chase their dreams. I caught mine and shot it.
Oh, I admit it was cute, but it kept crappin' on my lawn!
Endangered? Not any more!
The other two claim she’s just a narwhal in drag.
I have this silly little goal of shooting one of everything.
I’d been chasing him for years, but always mythed.
I bagged it at the end of a rainbow after the damnedest gumdrop storm you ever saw.
Well of course it's extinct, now...
I made an unbelievable shot.
And that's when he said I could make any wish I wanted.
Of course, that was before the Endangered Species Act.
Getting it out of Disney's Animal Kingdom was even more difficult...
My granddaughter was upset, but I think it toughened her up.
Unfortunately, that may be the last time I take my daughter big game hunting.
Up to the instant I pulled the trigger I didn't believe in them either.
Yes, my grandchildren were heartbroken, but I just had to have one.
I know it's not real, but then-neither are we!
We had the devil of a time getting it past Hagrid.
I had green alligators and long-necked geese, some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees. Some rats and cats and elephants but as sure as you’re born, I just never had a unicorn.
I do try to use the whole unicorn.
The hard part was finding a princess to act as the bait.
The DNA resequencing and cloning cost a fortune, but I got to shoot her.
That's what happens when you give a shotgun to a virgin.
This one I shot out from under my granddaughter on the carousel.
The eyelashes remind me of your mother.
Yeah, I know. I got the last one.
That shot was especially challenging because of the young girl on its back
Bagged this baby during the second act of Carousel
The difficult part was finding a virgin for bait.
Asked the agent for a unique safari package. Ten minutes later, I was being shoved into a wardrobe.
A one-point buck…pathetic.
Did I ever tell you about the tragic ending of my daughter's seven-year-old birthday party?
I had to throw the mermaid back in.
I didn’t shoot the unicorn. He dropped dead when Trump was elected president.
Just north of Woodstock in 1969.
My therapist told me that I needed to quit childish things, so I took up hunting
Candyland will never be the same.
I bagged a leprechaun also but I thought it might be in bad taste.
I always say: If you love something, shoot it, and mount it on your wall.
The clock? Mid-century. Our find at a garage sale.
My daughter still isn't talking to me.
I was given this one after investing in Airbnb and Uber.
NOW there are no unicorns.
Some exotic place? Hell no. I bagged it at granddaughter's birthday party.
Yup. That was the last one.
Amazing, yes, and what's really gratifying is, all the hunting fees I paid go to support unicorn conservation!
took her down right over the rainbow
There's the one that got away, and this is the one that doesn't exist
I kind of regret shooting that one. Only has one horn.
We camouflaged ourselves as gumdrops at the entrance of The Rainbow Bridge.
When I was your age, hunting was interesting
Our LSD trip was successful
My children needed years of psychotherapy after this one.
So hard these days to know what's real and what's not!
I hear they're magically delicious.
I didn’t realize that she was the last one.
In the end it took about 450 mg of mescaline to hunt one of them down.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
It was a long, strange trip.
I bagged that one with Leary in the '60s.
Your grandson's brownies are magical.
You should’ve seen the look on my daughters face.
The tenderloin was magical.
If we didn’t pay to hunt them, they probably wouldn’t even exist anymore.
Back then, of course, it wasn’t an endangered species
You bet it was tough. They’re almost never in season.
He said, 'Don't dream it, do it.' So I did.
I've wanted one ever since I was a little girl but it's not quite the same now.
Would you look at the rack on her!
My kid told me that all I had to do was believe to see the unicorns. It worked!
I have to replace the ice cream cone every once in a while, but my daughter hasn't noticed.
Most unusual...I came across a herd running in circles...  with small children on their backs...
What's weird is the guy down at Jimmy's Taxidermy said it was a fake.
Luckily mythical creatures are not on the endangered species list.
On eBay
I know I know. A one-point isn’t as impressive as a ten-point.
Almost makes up for the dragon that I missed on my last trip.
I bagged this one in the Magic Kingdom.
I always knew there was something wrong with him. Who puts two candles on their mantelpiece?
Do you believe me now?
Of course, me being a virgin gave me an advantage that not every fella has.
It’s from my first IPO.
I had to be pretty imaginative to bag him.
Got that with my My Little Pony Bolt-Action Remington.
I really wanted a rhinoceros, but they're on the endangered species list.
I think it's starting to kick in. Should we all kiss?
Oh hell, this ones just my mask from burning man.
Bagged it at my daughters birthday party
Yeah, last one. They went fast once Trump reversed Obama's ban on hunting them.
And that, gentlemen, was the last one on earth, so I sure as Hell didn't want to miss.
Fake news knows no bounds.
My granddaughter has disowned me.
You should've seen the looks on those second graders...
The centaur was too big for the wall.
Yeh, about as rare as a black man being invited into my den, I’d say.
When I heard here was only one left I knew I had to have it
My granddaughter was really unhappy with this one.
I love LSD nights at your house.
My first time carousel hunting and I bagged a unicorn.
The tooth fairy shot it.
Our interior designer doesn’t exist either.
Yeah, that was a good trip...but I did feel kinda silly wearing glittery rainbow camouflage.
It's the only one I've ever seen.
I call it my Mythbuster trophy.
My expedition set out the day the Mythical Animals Act was repealed.
The hunt was legendary but obtaining the permit was a nightmare.
I slightly misheard when she requested a legendary feast to celebrate our anniversary.
I bet there's a magical story behind that one.
Bagged that one on safari in Camelot.
Just lucky to get it before they went extinct.
For some reason, this one always makes the little girls cry.
I have always been an advocate for diversity.
This goes great with the Care Bearskin rug.
My daughter has stopped speaking with me.
Merry-go-round. Chainsaw.
We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold...
My children have stopped talking to me...
I'll tell you the story, but you're not going to believe it.
I was a little skeptical about the “magical safari” but let me tell you, money well spent.
Now you understand why I think climate change is a hoax
They taste like chicken.
You may be a wizard Harry, but you're also a bit of a git!
People kept saying she was too young for an assault rifle, but I said no....
Wayfair?
The divorce is going fine. Thanks for asking.
My little princess bagged this one.
The President shot the middle one on the Whitehouse lawns.
It's my old horse. I glued the painted carrot on his forehead.
And that one I shot at my daughter's birthday party
Far be it from me to brag, but that was the last one.
C'mon, how could I not?
Whoever selects the finalists for the New Yorker caption contest has really bad taste.
Sparkles here is the reason I only have one lung.
It was the most challenging terrain I've ever hunted -- the display floor at FAO Schwarz.
Well, they don't exist anymore.
I had to use glitter bullets on that one.
Yes, bagged that on a trip with Eric and Don Jr..
Next year we're going after Tinkerbell.
The NRA is insisting on diversity.
I got the very last one!
Anyone can be a myth-buster, but how many have the commitment to be a myth-killer?
Now, this one I don't remember too much. I was experimenting with LSD at the time.
Keeps the grandkids in line, that’s for sure.
Poor bastard thought _I_ was imaginary.
I'm still wondering why she isn't called a unihorn
It's the only way anyone would believe me.
...so it turns out they are actually really easy to sneak up on!
It turns out that a My Little Pony hunting license is very pricey.
Yeah, my granddaughter was NOT happy.
Actually, it tasted sorta like chicken.
And that's my little pony...
My granddaughter no longer speaks to me, but I like it.
White privilege. Isn't it beautiful?
We don’t allow our granddaughters in this room.
All I remember is that it was the '60s, in San Francisco....
The one on the left isn't real.
Climate change has unexpected consequences.
My daughter still hasn’t forgiven me for that one.
Actually, Big Foot shot that one.
I had to be so accurate at the time as the carousel was fully occupied.
It was the only way I could prove it exists... or used to.
Fiction trumps reality.
Now this one I'm particularly proud of. I completely made it up.
I bagged him at the Renaissance Faire.
She was walking under a rainbow, through a cloud of fairy dust, and BAM I made the kill shot.
Proud? Not really. I was actually after Bigfoot.
This one has eluded Donald Jr. for quite some time.
And that one is just a figment of my imagination.
I can’t believe she almost threw out your rainbow camouflage.
My daughter's not happy about it.
...So now you know why I’m banned from Scotland.
It was an adventure of mythical proportions.
Never mind that; what did you do with the Princess?
Oh yes, that was a magical trip...
You know, it was just too hard to keep its wings clipped
It took forever, but you have to indulge the trophy wife.
It was strange how this one kept bobbing up and down going in circles and not to mention the music.
My granddaughters hate me, but it was an amazing hunt.
Trump said it was okay.
I don't think this is what my daughter meant when she asked for a stuffed unicorn.
Gotta admit, boys, that nothing tops a hunting expedition to 'Narnia'.
... and that was the last time I dropped acid on a hunting safari.
My daughter disowned me.
And this one is from the time Cynthia refused to clean her room.
Well, he granted me one wish.
...so there I was in the Candy Cane forest
Mythical, maybe. Dead, definitely.
Realistic looking, but, Fake News.
If you thought killing a lion in Africa was expensive...
I don't think this is what your daughter meant when she said she wanted a unicorn...
I spied him as he was taking a drink from the lemonade springs in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
Yes,the false eyelashes surprised me too. And the wig.
It was the last one and I just had to have it.
The thing is, he was aiming for the dragon.
Don Jr said endangered species are THE status symbol.
1998. Family trip to Candyland. My daughter still won't talk to me.
I shot this one with a rainbow.
The kids were pretty upset about that one.
Caption 1: "3D printing has done wonders for my trophy collection." Caption 2: "I said narwhal but I think my dealer heard Warhol."
Not me ... my little granddaughter bagged that one. That was before she became a vegan.
I had to get one before they were all gone.
It’s the only one I brought down using an ice cream cone!
I took this specimen from the Forbidden Forest. Thank goodness Trump lifted the unicorn import ban.
It's not a white rhino, but what can you do?
My daughter’s first kill. She was only ten.
I credit my imaginary friend for the middle trophy.
Taxidermist let us stuff her with cotton candy.
Why chase a fantasy when you can just hang it on your mantle?
We read that giving the kids a say in decorating might help them cope with the move.
It was always on my bucket list.
So lifelike....
Bagged that one in San Francisco, Summer of Love.
Strangely enough, after all the years of looking I found it under by daughter's bed.
Yeh...I bagged that one in Narnia.
Bagging that one was a dream come true.
Got the permit thanks to Secretary of Interior Zinke and Trump Jr.
Technically not endangered.
They're supposed to have magical powers, but, you know, they look nice on a wall, too.
Donors visit to Eric and Donald, Jr.'s last of their species room.
I feel a little guilty about that one.
Yes, she's a beauty from a bygone era- the carousel from Palisades Park.
That one's an accident. I was aiming for Bigfoot.
… and I traded the Trump boys two pandas for this beauty.
It was particularly difficult to bring that into the country.
You would not believe what my granddaughter called me!
She begged me to spare her life, but what am I - a Democrat?
So they did exist!
My son shot his horse and the horn was my idea.
True Higgins, apart from misplacing my glasses, the rhino safari was superb.
The good news is my proctologist expects me to have a full recovery.
It's supposedly mythical, but I found lots of them on Wall Street.
I bagged that one at Palisades Amusement Park in '70.
It's the first one that's actually a chick magnet.
She was originally commissioned for the Oval but Don was insecure about the pink and purple sparkly flowing mane.
As expected, tastes like Chicken.
For some reason, my family stopped talking to me after this one.
Weird but the deer and the cow were the hard ones to get . . .
'It doesn't look real, does it?'
I got that one off a Merry Go Round in 1989.
God bless Scott Pruitt and the easing of EPA regulations.
Needless to say, my daughter’s birthday wasn’t the success I was expecting.
You might recall this from that New Age remake of The Godfather?
Most evil hunter? I was neck and neck with the President's son and some dentist, but now I'm a head.
Yep, tagged this one in the enchanted forest.
How was I to know it was the last of its kind. Now my kids won't even talk to me.
I've heard some jerkwater wizard has put a bounty on my head.
The kids got tired of him.
They were thought to be extinct, but I proved otherwise.
My granddaughter said the giant teddy bear still didn’t make up for it.
The wife made me glue on the horn. I guess a unicorn is exotic, but a horse is weird.
I hallucinate when I hunt.
Of course I told my daughter they weren't real.
Oh, that's just my little trophy.
If anyone asks, this doesn't exist.
We mostly use it for ring toss.
This one was a gift from Dick Cheney.
Surprisingly, once barbequed, it tasted like chicken.
It's the only thing that keeps my damn grandkids from stopping by.
He was hiding in my daughter's bedroom.
This one I bagged on a Coney Island merry-go-round safari
Bagged that when I was on an LSD trip years ago.
Took her down with My Little Winchester.
Shot it with a rainbow
Yes, I bagged this beauty days after the EPA announced the repeal of the Endangered Species Act. I must admit, I had my doubts, but this President continues to deliver on his promises.
That's the last one I ever shot.
Never hunt at night.
That's when my granddaughter stopped speaking to me.
A tough shot. She was spinning around on a carousel with a little kid on her back.
A phoenix over the fireplace would have made a lot more sense.
I bagged that one using hollow-point skittles.
My grandchildren want to kill me...
So my daughter stopped speaking to me, but it really brings the room togerther.
After elephant tusks got the green light, I knew it was only a matter of time.
Actually, the hardest part of the hunt was getting all the glitter out of my truck afterward...
No choice really. Not if I wanted roses in the garden.
I hear they taste like chicken.
It was a magical moment.
My granddaughter has never forgiven me for that kill.
My next trophy is the tooth fairy.
Sure they’re rare, but the safari guy said this is the best way to support conservation.
Our centaur shot that one.
My daughter really wanted one, but she seemed upset when I showed it to her.
Yes, of course I knew it was endangered and now extinct but come on, look at those lashes.
She told me she wanted one, now my granddaughter won't talk to me.
The eyelashes are obviously fake.
That’s from the psilocybin safari
I almost mythed the one in the middle.
Not boasting, of course, but I got the very last one before they became extinct.
Well, when I was a kid Dad got me a gun instead of the My Little Pony I wanted.
And here we have my prized possession, the Hopes and Dreams of the Obama Administration.
It was a dream trip.
There were a lot of imaginary protests.
I literally killed a fantasy.
Next, come see the Loch Ness room.
Yes, it IS one of a kind.
My granddaughter still hasn't forgiven me for ruining her birthday party.
I was told they were extinct. That was obviously fake news.
"...and, I bagged this one, on the carousel, when I was 5".
I just asked the taxidermist to add on the ice cream cone, and voíla...
it was a magical feeling .
So if you don't eat red meat, you might try the orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet.
Are you a big game hunter or the prince of narnia?
Apparently they are pretty invasive in Narnia.
I bagged the one in the middle at F.A.O. Shwarz.
Yeah, it was the last one. I guess that means I "Won".
You like that - You should see the one Don Jr. and Eric got.
Haight-Ashbury, 1967.
...and he won the Belmont Stakes by a horn.
They can't be endangered if no one believes they're real.
I vacillate between seeing disdain or insouciance in those eyes.
By killing unicorns, we help conserve them for future generations
It was the Vice President who led the campaign to have it removed from the endangered species list.
Surprisingly, it tasted a lot like California Condor.
It's true some of my hunting stories are fairy tales.
My daughter isn't talking to me anymore.
Well, I guess Greg really did go to Candy Mountain for his latest hunting trip.
I know it's really a prop. But he just shouted, "Fake News" until we agreed to hang it.
He almost makes up for the mermaid that slipped the hook.
That antique clock is a rare Tambour.
In the end, I learned to believe in myself
And this, my friends, was once a gentle, inquisitive, and whimsical creature whom I felt like killing.
Well, well...I guess unicorns really do...I mean did exist.
The unicorn required an accurate shot, since the merry-go-round had started moving.
I'm fine with it. He assured me he wasn't the last.
I bagged the last one after the EPA voided the Endangered Species Act
And the steaks were, of course, served rare.
Don't exist? Well, yes--now.
My daughter brought it back from a birthday party.
My Little Pony is next.
There's no such thing as unicorns...now.
Inconceivable! Did you know that your clock is 3 minutes fast?
I bagged that one in Haight-Ashbury in the sixties.
Timothy Leary and I were walking in a park near Greenwich, and on a whim we followed some six year old to a birthday party and there it was.
I bagged this one while on safari in Candyland.
...and I got that one with a 30-06 and some damn strong hallucinogens.
I'm hoping it's less controversial than Cecil the Lion.
They're really just horses from the neck down.
It's just from a big plush stuffed animal toy, but it really freaked out the grandkids.
I’ve hunted for one all my life, then there it was, doing a commercial.
Apparently they're immortal, so the eyes do literally follow you around the room.
Don't worry. The feds only care about endangered species. Myths are exempt.
I still can't believe he never existed.
There we were, face to face on the merry-go-round, when I slowly lifted the rifle...
Of course, the real challenge was getting it past customs.
Bagged it during my weekend at Woodstock.
Yep, Florida Fun Fair Carousel 1986.
Actually, my wife took its other antler in the divorce.
Actually, it’s just a pony that was raised on GMO hay.
I'd had a few drinks at the time and just thought I was seeing things.
Actually it tastes like chicken.
My daughter wanted to mount a unicorn, so I did.
Got 'em at thirty yards in front of Tristar Pictures, Culver City, California...
The experience really wasn't as magical as I expected.
How? I followed my dream.
...and this one is from Don Junior's private collection
If it was real, my daughters would have my head up there instead.
My grand-daughter kept asking for one, so...
If you think that’s impressive, you should see the hood of my car.
It was easy. She reminded me of my ex-wife.
Don, Jr. really screwed up this time.
It was a billion in one shot.
Wow, Stuart! Is that clock real?!
I think it's a fake. What do you think?
Do you know how hard it is to score a Unicorn permit?
We’re now hunting children’s dreams to extinction.
I got this one on a carousel.
Capturing the horse was easy. Gluing the cone on was the hard part.
Don't feel bad. It's only imaginary!
I bagged that one while hunting for a big foot in Narnia.
It tasted like chicken.
Yeah, I’m at the top of PETA’s list.
Unique? Sure. But my little girl hasn’t spoken to me in three years.
Is this what they meant when they said we should embrace diversity?
I'm still torn over the ethics of killing for fantasy sport.
The magic eventually wears off ...
It's a fake.
It turned out that it was the company's earnings that were mythical.
I used a legendary bullet.
If he were really so magical, he would have flown away.
That's the last time my daughter went with me on safari.
Well, they WERE real.
Did you buy the whole Ferris wheel?
It turns out that PETA doesn't have leverage in dealing with mythical creatures.
My daughter compared me to Voldemort. It was worth it.
My granddaughter bagged the one in the middle.
It was unusual. No blood. Just glitter.
It lends a certain 'Je ne sais quoi,' don't you think?
The one in the middle is from a trip with Puff the Magic Dragon
This one I shot because I really didn't like his attitude
The wife thought the wall needed a touch of the feminine.
To be fair, it wasn't on any endangered list.
It was really tough getting that one off the carousel.
Not bad for a Muggle, eh?
We would have preferred a Centaur-piece.
I bagged this one off the Coney Island carousel
Lucky for me, it was the last one.
I didn't so much kill it, as I did love it to death.
I bagged this one at Burning Man.
That middle one was tough because the damned carousel kept spinning around and around.
Kind of magical, don't you think?
I never dreamed environmental deregulation would go this far!
Do I regret killing Sparkles? Only every time I see a rainbow.
...so graceful and magical. Also, dumb.
Isn't 3D printing wonderful.
I have to admit, I thought all those trips to Narnia he talked about were made up.
It's from a merry-go-around but it keeps my grandchildren away.
And that was the end of what had been a very promising startup I.P.O.
This one is My Little Favorite.
Bagged this one just outside Orlando at a place called "Universal" something-or-other.
Do you think this means female orgasms are real too?
Shouldn't that be in the Rainbow Room?
I bagged this one at the Cloisters.
There I was - the sun just beginning to fall - and I heard a noise. I whirled around and suddenly realized - I was alone - on the Merry-go-round. So...
Am I a bad person?
I swear if they say one more thing about how unicorns are not real.
I shot her last Sunday in my fantasy hunting league.
He charged, a twinkle in his eyes, rainbows shooting from his nostrils....
Lost the granddaughter with that one.
They say the meat tastes like Big Bird...
So I said to Don Jr and Eric, 'Why don't you let me keep this one?'
I got it when the circus closed It reminds me of my ex wife
Some guilt, but Don Jr. said his dad removed it from the endangered list, so...you know. I took my shot.
My first fantasy convention, and I quite enjoyed it.
I hate sounding like Trump, but I’ve got to say it’s a fake trophy.
Trump Jr. assured me that it wasn't wasteful. The villagers were happy for the meat.
White privilege. It’s everywhere you look.
I bagged this one during a snipe hunt
My daughter has never stopped hating me.
Before this, my daughters used to talk to me.
This baby and the stuffed Yeti in the hallway are the jewels of my collection.
Don't you dare tell my granddaughter.
Dirty little secret, they love Doritos.
That one I bagged while hunting on acid.
This is the result of Trump gutting the Imaginary Species Act.
Turns out it was just an ice cream cone.
Actually, my grand-daughter bagged that one.
Yup, ... Don Jr. got this one—the last on Earth.
There's nothing quite like bagging the last intellectual conservative.
It's actually just a GMO horse.
At first I thought I was seeing things, but then I saw the glitter trail.
Bagged him on the carousel at Asbury Park.
Marlene didn't believe I'd seen it, so I found it again and shot it to prove her wrong.
I'll never forget my first trip to Disneyland.
Scott Pruitt made the middle trophy possible.
Fun fact: It was not the last one.
Yes. He actually did fart glitter.
They never let me back in that toy store.
Ah, my favorite. That was 18 years ago, Silicon Valley.
Our guide was a satyr named Lenny.
Almost extinct was becoming too common, so I've moved on to imaginary.
My granddaughter wasn't as excited about it as I expected.
'I shot that on my fake hunting trip.'
That one,yes unfortunately I was arrested for shooting a horse with a party hat.
Yeah, got that one back in the 60s...
Bagging this one was mythical.
And this summer we're off to Crete to bag a minotaur. Let me know if you want in.
Yes, which is what makes it so easy to get the permit.
I have the last passenger pigeon too.
I bagged that one on my Coney Island safari.
And I bagged this beauty in Narnia.
My granddaughter has a 'My Little Pony' collection and I have mine.
Better keep this under wraps, remember that dentist who killed the Lion?
Yes, this was yet another trophy donated by Dick Cheney...
It was his last wish.
Rainbow glitter everywhere. It does not come off.
This one I bagged at the Magic Kingdom.
I know that hunting endangered species is illegal, but there is no law protecting imaginary animals.
From Toys"R"Us's going-out-of-business sale.
The difficulty was finding a virgin to capture it.
This one is a gift from the Trump brothers.
I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit this, but I simply fired into a herd of them outside Palo Alto and this one just dropped.
I got this one on my dream safari
Little girl screaming on a crazed animal bucking up and down and running in circles. Lucky for her, I had my firearm.
It's impressive, but I think his FBI Director still tops it.
There may be some lingering resentment.
I was hunting pegasus and this showed up.
It was even more a triumph of imagination than of hunting prowess.
I tell the grand kids that it is a narwhal.
It tasted like chicken.
That one is not as horny as the other two.
It was magically delicious!
I bagged this one with a thirty-aught-six. And a virgin.
Rare? Yes, but anything for my little girl.
Buying a six-year-old's soul was the hard part. After that, it was just like hunting anything else.
Honestly. It was roadkill.
The one in the middle is virtual.
I really wanted a rhino head but they're very scarce these days.
I got her at a birthday party.
He was a threat to our business model.
Well Frank, I think you just punched your ticket to go straight to hell.
This one's unbelievable.
I have to confess, I didn't shoot it. It was roadkill.
This one reminds me of my daughhter’s fifth birthday. She hasn’t spoken to me in 30 years.
It was a ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ situation, if ever there was one.
I shot it with a magic bullet.
You should see the Pegasus that got away.
You should’ve seen the centaur that got away.
I bagged this one somewhere over the rainbow.
It took us ages to track this one down
Actually it tastes like chicken.
I bagged him when the carousel stopped.
the tricky part was finding a taxidermist with experience...
The taxidermist moonlights as a stylist for a high-end funeral parlour.
I like unicorns who weren’t captured
I got that one while I was micro dosing.
She has those Betty Grable eyes.
It’s for my granddaughter. She collects unicorns.
...and I donated the meat to the Girl Scouts.
"The center trophy I bagged on a trip with Timothy Leary, the others on a trip to Africa.
And that one I bagged on Fantasy Island
No, I'd never heard of a horse falling on his sword, either.
The grandkids quit talking to me after I bagged that one at 'Play-Time Safari Park.'
That one took my glitter gun
It was an honor to be in Secretary Zinke's hunting party!
Bagged that one for my little granddaughter. Ungrateful child.
It was a dream hunt.
It just tastes like chicken.
My taxidermist is also in my fantasy league.
Coney Island, 1962. I was five.
She's got Betty Davis eyes.
This trophy was from my safari in Silicon Valley.
I bagged him in under the rainbow in my granddaughter's playhouse.
Without us hunters, there really wouldn't be a conservation movement.
Unbelievable!
The hunt was magical.
You don't see too many one-point bucks.
Now, we are truly able to say there is no such thing as a unicorn.
My first wife never let me go unicorn hunting.
The hard part of bagging this one was finding a virgin to use as a lure.
I shot that one on Halloween.
Who wants to tell Jack that he'll have to re-book the entertainment for his granddaughter's birthday party?
And this is the trophy I took when I stepped off the merry go round.
It's of the genus carousel.
He was eating your mother's roses.
Unicorns aren’t real? Another example of a #fakenews story.
"Gentlemen, this is the horn section".
Oh that one? Coney Island merry go round, Why?
I bagged this one at my neice’s third birthday party.
My daughter-in-law gave me a book about getting in touch with your feminine side and I thought, ". . . girls . . . unicorns . . . OK, I can be open to change . . . ."
I shot that one at FAO Schwarz in New York.
I got tired of keeping it real.
It can't be real. Just look at those lashes...
She never even knew what glitter.
And that was one of the many that did’t quite make it in Silicon Valley.
The eyelashes are real but I glued the horn on myself
In the other room I have some green alligators and long-necked geese, humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees...
The farting rainbow thing is the myth
My toughest kill. It kept flying around farting rainbows.
Now that's a combover!
Most people don't believe the story behind that one.
Ironically, it was the last time I spoke to my daughter.
County fair carousel - 1977
Bagged him in Disneyworld in 07.
Bagged it near the GMO Research Center.
My taxidermist is also the town beautician.
No, don't be silly. I used to maintain the carousel down on the boardwalk.
I bought it on eBay; They said it was African.
That's when my grandaughter stopped talking to me.
Just gazing at her every day reminds me to be more happy and peaceful.
Long story short, that's why my daughter doesn't speak to me anymore.
I actually hit this one with my car.
It's from his last acid trip.
The hardest part was getting the rainbow bullets.
It wasn't as hard as you think. It just kept coming around and around until I bagged it
Oh yes, that was a magical hunt.
I bagged him while on safari in Orlando, Florida.
You really do take the fun out of everything.
I do have a few mythical issues with it.
It's actually my wife's sex toy.
I want the house to also appeal to the Millenials and Generation Z clients so we installed this vegan, faux fur, gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, all-organic, grass woven unicorn head.
The last electable centrist Democrat.
I was the first to bag a Silicon Valley unicorn.
I bagged that one back in 1974 while I was tripping.
Almost looks real, doesn't it?
That one I bagged on the Timothy Leary hunting party.
My ex did call me the killer of dreams
That one there wouldn't stop pooping rainbow sprinkles in my yard.
Only a virgin can capture one, but if you have a .308 rifle, the are pretty easy to take down.
I bagged the one in the middle at Disney On Ice
It took a lot of hunting, but we found ours on Tinder.
Endangered? It’s fictitious!
I know. I know. I didn't think they existed either. I saw it and just had to have it, so I shot it.
I really loved the ‘60’s!
My daughter says fantasy far outweighs reality.
It's illegal to hunt narwals so I'm just hiding the horn in plain view
Don’t ask.
Actually, I hit it while backing out of my driveway.
The hardest part was getting the glitter off of my safari outfit.
I bagged that one on the plains of Silicon Valley.
My wife shot that one.
I swear, I got the last one out there
I was at a Trump resort when I bagged this baby.
We were fortunate the hunting ban was eased.
The horn is the straightest thing about this.
What's funny is he was aiming for the leprechaun.
Shot that one is Asbury Park.
Not many people know this, but Unicorns are the other other white meat.
Quite a feat actually - first, I had to imagine it, and then, I had to kill it. Of course, the taxidermy had to share the experience.
'You ever belly crawl on a rainbow?'
It's only for the summer, my granddaughters are coming to stay.
It's funny how the eye seems to follow you around the room.
Shhhh... they're all fake.
Bagged this beauty at my granddaughter's birthday party.
The one in the middle was the toughest to track insofar as it doesn't exist.
They are not quite as rare as you think.
I bagged that one in my sleep.
Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
So much for fantasies.
And this one is from the Enchanted Forest trip last year.
Of course the grandchildren aren't allowed in this room.
How'd I know that I'd crossed into Fantasy Land?
An entire gender reviles me.
He was in a herd of strange beasts who were oddly running in a circle,
Our company takes great pride in diversity.
It's always been a fantasy of mine.
I got a great deal on the middle one - a British guy called Voldemort sold it to me.
Now let's move on to the rec room and Paddington Bear.
I bagged that one at Coney Island.
It just seemed to be daring me.
Apparently there was a place called Silicon Valley that bred and nursed the damned things.
Narnia has the best big game hunting.
Shot that down by the lake where I landed a 105 pound mermaid last spring. Got her mounted on the wall in another room.
Well, it’s no longer her little pony.
My granddaughter isn't thrilled.
June 6, 1967, my first Acid trip. Woke up and the damn thing was on my wall.
I caught him crossing the road in Silicon Valley.
My granddaughter is quite a shot.
It might be the only one, but I did love shooting it.
I had to outbid Don Junior in order to shoot it, but it was worth it.
An impala, a unicorn and a bull walk into a barn . . .
Who made the sangria?
I don't know why everyone's so impressed. It's just a one-point buck.
Grab your coats. The Yeti is in the walk-in freezer.
Call me a snob, but I think the one in the middle’s a reproduction.
The story behind this one is unbelievable.
What better way to preserve the last of it's kind.
And that, gentlemen, is what happens to start-ups that fail on me.
Yes, it's true: rainbows! But they still smell like regular farts.
The broker said it’s one of a kind, but I don’t buy it.
Yeah? Well, maybe YOU'RE the one who's mythical.
It took a lot of time and money to acquire that one, but every time a child sees it and cries their eyes out, I realize it was worth it.
And that's the last time I spoke with my daughter.
And, that 'Come, hither' look made this one an especially hard kill.
...so naturally I shot him.
Huh. So after all these years standing here, staring into the upside down, we finally have proof it’s not a myth: they do allow black people in the club!
It was a fairy tale come true.
The NRA has my back.
I'll lend you the book—it describes these beasts and where to find them.
How a horse mated with a narwhal, I'll never know.
It's my pride and joy, but my daughter won't ever speak to me again.
How does having this make me feel? I dunno. I'm a sociopath.
Well, it wasn't all rainbows and butterflies, if that's what you're asking...
You guys wouldn't have believed a photo.
I prefer my meat rare.
That one’s from my first LSD trip.
Can you believe it, the last one, and 30% off
It sure is a beautiful trophy - the downside is that I'm doomed to live a cursed, half-life for the rest of eternity, and my 7 year old grand-daughter hates me.
It wasn't on the endangered species list, so I figured it was fair game.
An antelope, a unicorn, and a bull walk into a topless bar . . .
Before you judge me, know that he identified as a mule deer.
Mythical my ass!
Oh yes! Becky is an avid hunter and NRA member!
Yes, I got it off Amazon Prime.
Lucky shot, really.  I was aiming at an endangered snow leopard.
Seen one, seen ‘em all.
"Apparently it''s kind of rare".
I couldn't find a spotted owl.
It's the trophy I'd dreamed of ever since I was a kid.
She lived an alternative lifestyle.
This was the last one in the world, so I knew I had to have it.
I used superglue...and suave. My ten year old daughter still thinks it’s legit.
The taxidermist said he'd never seen anything like it.
I was told the money would be used to save all the other endangered unicorns
How the hell was I supposed to know it was a mythical creature.
Her smile is so enigmatic; and do you see how her eyes seem to follow me...
Why don't they call it a unihorn?

Where’s the button that makes it sing?

Even the bull is skeptical.
It's a palomino I bagged with a waffle cone to the forehead.
I thought it was a glitter gun.
College days. Hunting trip with my future father-in-law. First and last time I dropped acid.

So, anyone gonna say anything about the Unicorn on Dave's wall?
Yes, it is a unique horn.
My daughter shot this one.
It funds conservation
Yep, I got the last one
I got it from Don Jr.'s divorce sale. He said that hunting it was his alibi.
I was actually aiming for that raccoon that keeps getting in our trash.
It was back in the 60s on acid.
Hell, I'd shoot a rainbow if I could stuff it and hang it on the wall!
It came to me in a dream.
You have no idea how many shrooms it took to bag this one
Yes, that hunt was magical.
My Little Pony. Four hour trek through suburban jungle. Toys R Us Jersey City.
My bad. I thought I was shooting at a white rhino.
Tanzania in ‘82; South Africa in ‘90; the mythical kingdom of Hagsgate just last year.
My daughter hates me forever.
I snagged that one at the merry-go-round.
She decided she wanted a hamster
Now this trip was a dream
This one was quite elusive, until the carousel stopped...
Well, that sort of puts a damper on make-believe.
The hard part was finding a gun store that sold tiny magical bows and arrows.
It's just magical, isn't it?
I bagged that one at Six Flags.
And that one's from the 60s. My first trip!
I like to play 2 truths and a lie with my guests.
I caught him with Fruit Loops.
Yessiree I wouldn't have believed it, either, if I hadn't killed it with my own two hands.
This one was like taking candy from a baby.
No, I didn’t mean it metaphorically.
My daughter hasn’t tried to argue with me since.
My daughter is a little upset over this one.
Got him my second acid trip!
Actually quite challenging - the merry-go-round was in motion and the unicorn was difficult to dislodge.

Only one horn, but I shot it anyway.
Because with a Pegasus, you have a whole body to stuff, not to mention the wings.
Who's up for a game of ring toss?
They're lucky creatures, aren't they? Unicorns....
Fortunately, the Department of the Interior eased some burdensome regulations.
I bagged that one in my neice's playroom.
Now most people say it doesn't count as 'real' hunting, but let me tell you, when I was on that carousel and this guy was lunging right at me...
I got a great deal on this one. Half price since it’s only got one horn.
My dream trophy.
Yup. Stole a march from Don, Jr. on this one.
It was a fairytale ending
And this came from the great Silicon Valley.
I bagged it off the merry-go-round at the mall.
The hardest part was finding a virgin in Long Island.
Well, this one took a little imagination...
I paid for that one in Bitcoin.
I put fifteen child therapists’ kids through college for that one.
Predator, myth, prey.
I shot that one in Thurber's back yard.
My granddaughter's first kill.
Plus, now I know that my daughter is a virgin.
Apparently I'm the only one that sees a Unicorn?
... and this one is my grandchildren's attempt to shame me, but I kinda like it.
Yes. That was the day I ate the florescent mushroom.
It's so rare these days that one gets to shoot something truly unique. Damn shame, really.
Yep, she was one of a kind.
I used to cherish our father-daughter hunting trips.
They're indigenous to Shangri-La.
So thats where the rainbow steaks came from.
I never should have introduced you to My Little Pony.
So, it used to exist?
It expresses the hope that new species will be discovered, which I might then hunt.
I have to move it. My wife says enough with the asymmetry.
It was his last wish. Pretty progressive for a black stallion if you ask me.
Of course bagging a unicorn on Wall Street was even more satisfying.
It's only once you're in the .0001% that you can hunt mythical species too.
We use the leprechaun as a paperweight.
I was trying to shoot a My Little Pony but he’ll have to do.
I thought there was a law against hunting imaginary species.
Nowadays, you can't even look at a horny female.
I made on my 3D printer.
Now everyone knows I'm a virgin.
Its only magical power is to collect dust.
So glad, " Fake news" is a thing of the past"!
It's from the fairground; I'd hang it up when the kids were naughty.
Remember when you guys asked me why my granddaughter and I are estranged?
The hardest part was finding a virgin.
It's actually harder to find a good Scotch.

It was her way of saying, 'the magic is over.'
And people thought they were extinct.
My granddaughter no longer speaks to me, but I'd do it all over again.
Nothing's fake anymore. My daughter thinks he's real.
My granddaughter bagged her at a birthday party
I bagged the antelope in Africa, the water buffalo in India, and the unicorn in the Alpha Centauri System.
It's technically called a moderate and barely seen around these parts anymore.
Well, if they did exist, they no longer do .
Yes, and there was only ever one.

We decided the room needed some color
This spot was intended for the leprechaun, but the 12 gauge blew its head off.

These Snapchat filters have really gotten out of control.
The guys at Mythbusters still don't believe me.
Extremely rare and maddeningly elusive, but tastes like horsemeat.
Sure, Ron, all your hunting stories end with 'it must have been magic.'
You'll never see another of these. It's from my hunt through the very last Toys R Us store.
My little girl shot that one.
My granddaughter caught that one.
If you think that’s amazing, you should have seen it when it was alive.
All I had to do was follow the rainbow-colored poop.
I figured I’d mount him before my ex-wife did.
Turns out that was the last one.
Her mother was a horse, her dad, a Narwhal.
We made the lodge inclusive.
To be fair - it was running straight at the armored Jeep.
I'm fairly certain that's why the trophy hunter was cursed and died pennilessly.
I'm at the age now where I can only hunt on merry-go-rounds.
I bagged that one in the wilds of my granddaughter's closet.
The virgin was harder to find.
Still not sure why they're not called unihorns.
I bagged him while on safari in Shangri-La.
I guess Noah let him on at the last moment.
It belonged to the prior owner, some British guy named Lord Voldemort.
Talk about completing my wish list.
I shot the one in the middle with an imaginary rifle.
In the Middle Ages these could only be captured by virgins...
I got this one in Never-never Land.
My wife bought the unicorn and killed the other two with her car.
Taxidermist did a helluva job on that narwhal.
Actually, the biggest challenge was convincing it I was a virgin.
The Unicorn filets were a hit at the EPA banquet.
At the time, it wasn't endangered.
Her father was Seattle Slew; her mother was a narwhale.
By the time I realized it was Mardi Gras, it was too late.
I bagged this in Central Park, near the Carousel
The middle one is my ex-wife.
It was a fantasy come true!
It was finding a virgin that was the hard part.
If you think that's impressive, you should see the Loch Ness Monster I have mounted in the dining room.
They're not on the NRA's list of protected species, so I shot him.
It was chaotic on the carousel but I managed to bag him with the first shot.
Really, it's no different than shooting a horse.
I won't be a virgin much longer with this bad boy on the wall.
I used a double barreled shotgun and strong hallucinogens.
It's true, they are endangered, but I didn't know that at the time.
They said it couldn't be done. But I just glued that sucker right on there.
Of course, my little girl no longer speaks to me since I used her as bait.
So I said, "honey, if you don't bring your grades up, there will be consequences."
See that one in the middle there? It's diamond encrusted from Tiffany's. And keeps perfect time too.
But you should've seen the virgin that got away.
The Minotaur got away
I’m so proud. My 7 year old granddaughter bagged this one!
I took this one down with a glitter bomb.
I shot this one at a waterhole where it stopped to admire its reflection.
so then it says "what's the point?"
Most formidable carousel I ever tracked.
That one is for shorting Toys R Us.
We're thinning the overpopulated herd along Sand Hill Road.
"Being mythical, I didn't have to deal with all that endangered species nonsense".
I caught it with pinking shears and a bottle of cognac.
The taxidermist gave us half off.
I agree. I think you'll have to bump it if you want a bigger clock there.
My only concern was whether that was ivory or not.
I have always been a feminist.
...and the strip steaks were particularly magical.
There's almost a fairy tale quality to how I bagged this one
I bagged that one while on a very remote and dangerous Nigerian carousel!
And I thought the Stuffef Griffin in the Foyer was impressive.
Nice rhino, Jim.
It tasted a lot worse than it looks.
I bagged her in Fantasyland last year.
Luckiest of all creatures, they say.
The housecleaner refuses to clean the room on the other side of this wall
I have spent millions on my kids' therapy and they still haven't forgiven me.
Oh the unicorn? Nearly impaled me with that stupid horn. Had to go all rainbow on his ass!
I wanted to show, both of you, that we believe our diversity is our strength.
I may have crossed a line with that one...
Got that one on Halloween.
It took 10 years of genetic manipulation but we finally succeeded. And then I shot it.
That particular trophy was shot while on safari in Shangri-la.
It makes you respect the majesty of nature, doesn’t it?
The wife thought the room needed a feminine touch.
Hmm, suddenly Don Jr. doesn't look so bad...
The hard part was finding the virgin.
Yes it is unfortunate but from behind it looked just like the even more rare albino zebra.
It was a Rennaisance Fair safari.
It was really hard getting that head through customs.
But if I'm honest with myself, it hasn't filled that gaping hole in my heart like I thought it would.
Turns out wasn’t so lucky after all
This one's had a Rhinoplasty.
I never imagined it would be so hard to remove rainbow stains from camouflage.
A rhino tried to pretend he was a unicorn but I saw through the disguise.
Well I said to myself...they're just so damm cute I have to have one
My daughter’s sixth birthday party. Sunset.
My daughter bagged that one. Eleven years old and a crack shot.
Fuck Unicorns.
Shot that one at the abandoned state fairgrounds.
Maybe I misunderstood when it said "take me home".
Of course, my daughter still won’t talk to me.
And I was so sure my granddaughter would love it.
I bagged that one in Silicon Valley.
It was a long shot, I know.
Getting rid of the weakest link helps makes the rest of the herd stronger.
Let me show you my Mermaid wall.
Get with it, Earl...things don't have to be real to be useful.
I got him just outside Area 51
Hey, look there! He's shaking hands with the president in that photo.
My youngest cried for a month when I shot it in her bedroom.
Of the three branches of government, the elusive Judiciary proved the most difficult to harvest.
Forget the hunting rifle. To bring 'em down, you need radioactive nano-pixie dust. Not contaminated with glitter, of course.
This one was running in circles at the Mall.
Finding a virgin was the hardest part.
It's a.. uh, rare goat.
Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy shindig for preferred shareholders; nailed her in the parking lot.
Apparently the horn can cure cancer, but I prefer here over my fireplace.
Almost gored me while I was laying a trap of bacon and donuts.
I bagged this one at Startup Fantasy Camp
My daughter actually bagged that one.
It's ok, online they say there are plenty of other ones.
It isn’t all rainbows and...what’s the word I’m looking for?
I got that one at the carousel in Coney Island, but the dragon flew off before I could reload.
We had a helluva time sawing the other horn off.
...and our interior designer told us a little pop of color would be a nice update for our mounted head collection.
Yeah, she's a real beauty. I bagged her with Excalibur.
They did say imagination was the greatest weapon
Not cheap, I tell you. It cost me the pot of gold I found at the end of the rainbow!
My daughter hasn't slept in a week.
My daughter isn't too happy, but it really brings the room together.
Poach big or go home.
That was my reward after a successful hunt at Mar-a-Lago.
Gentlemen, it's called sustainable hunting. Best way to preserve the species.
and this is the allusive one-point buck. more absynth?
You’re thinking My Little Pony. This is just a unicorn.
Man, did my daughter ever let me have it when I bagged that one. I had to tell her that it came from a merry-go-round.
She was just hanging with the wrong crowd.
Sadly, she's the last of her kind. On the other hand, we're having flank steaks tonight.
Once I get sasquatch, my collection will be complete.
I'm pretty sure I bagged my limit on that one.
I value the middle one the most - speaking metaphorically.
Killing animals makes my tiny pecker feel about as big as that horn.
...and I took this majestic beast down at my daughters 5th birthday party.
Well, that's one way to live happily ever after...
Oh my God! Is that what happened to Twitlight Sparkle?
I told the taxidermist not to give me any bull.
Luckily, I bagged the Uni just before the law for imaginary species went into effect.
It was a great shot. Between the concession stand and the photo platform. Tracking wasn't that easy either.
And I've got a rainbow in the other room.
Because I couldn’t have something more unique than me exist.
I still can't believe it.
The unicorn was a bit hard to find.
A collector from Saudi Arabia offered me a billion dollars for the middle one. I should have taken it.
All you need is a horse, a gun, and some arts and crafts.
It once was a fairytale. They're now abundant in Silicon Valley.
That one I bought from a millennial.
My granddaughter still hasn't forgiven me.
Getting permission to shoot the horse was a breeze compared to finding the imported horn on the web.
This Trumplandian Unicorn was shot by Don Jr.
Actually, trophy hunting fees fund conservation.
The last unicorn.... We probably should have bred her first.
I brought in a team of leprechauns to stuff and mount it.
So, this hunt raised, for me, the issue of whether or not mythological life has sanctity...
I added the eyelashes myself
I bagged that one in Silicon Valley.
I was ultimately able to subdue the beast utilizing a bolt-action rifle and a single magic bullet.
Tell me about the size of that fish you caught again.
Yes, she left a trail of glitter behind her before I could finish her off."
You're right -- that's a unique horn.
It could be worse, some daughters hate their dad's because they left.
Look at the horn on that one!
It just fit the room much more than the centaur.
Want to see the Rainbow Room? It's just on the other side of the wall.
This one offered me a wish before I shot it.
I had to settle for the Unicorn. They won't issue a permit for Centaurs.
I told the taxidermist she was one of a kind.
The real difficulty was finding a virgin to bait the field.
Actually it’s a horse I shot accidently and the work of a creative taxidermist.
No, its just a faked up old pony that keeled over at my daughter's birthday party. Least I could do for her.
Yep, I got the last one
That's The Last Unicorn.
The other end's in the drawing room.
Shooting them is easy — the hard part’s finding a virgin in this day and age to serve as bait.
You wouldn't believe how distracting rainbows can be when trying to get a kill shot.
I do all my big-game hunting at the merry-go-round.
Nailed this little Lady on a Merry Go Round
“When Katherine said she wanted a Unicorn for her birthday, I don’t think this was exactly what she meant.
I'm a bit sad. I really thought that would be the one that got away.
I bagged him on the safari of my dreams.
It wasn't on the "Endangered Species List" so I decide to bag it.
You should have seen the look on that little kid's face when I jumped on the carousel with an axe.
No, I keep the original in the vault.
Very late at night December 13, 1969 at the estate of Dr. Timothy Leary.
I happened to be in Windsor, the day after the royal wedding...
This one will drive the animal rights folks wild.
Boys, I appreciate the intention, but at my age, symbolism is no substitute for Viagra.
I won't bore you with the details.
Yeah, that was a real fantasy shoot.
He came gracefully prancing out of the woods, a beautiful young woman, naked of course, astride his back--shot him, kept her.
We know a thing or two because we've seen thing or two; pamparrampampam
I had too: it was undocumented.
My son is the first gay member at his hunting club.
Don’t get me started on the glitter.
Knowing she was the last one made the hunt truly magical!
We thought she'd grow out of her my little pony phase.
Apparently, when you try to post a unicorn pic on Instagram, it dies.
My taxidermist created this one for me out of spare parts
I'm told Eric and Don Jr. had a tremendous tremendous time in Narnia.
I bagged that one with my imaginary gun.
Ah yes, she had the best merry-go-round
Good start..but we are still missing the pig with wings
This one makes up for me missing Bambi.
Yes, indeed! Now imagine what it would be like if all those gun-control nuts had their way!
... two Rice Krispies box tops and 10 bucks.
Now they're officially extinct.
Needed just one shot at Six Flags
And to think, for years people didn't believe this clock existed.
The rest of it is in the kitchen
I showed those venture capitalists. I just shot the damn thing.
I wanted something a bit more exotic.
He does have a point.
Well, I guess it's not technically horse meat.
It’s from a very exclusive and remote safari that my daughter chose.
Once there were more of them in Silicon Valley than anywhere else.
Well, if this bothers you- then you're really not going to like the centaur heads in the next room..
Sustainably harvested on rather long psychedelic safari.
At least I didn't take a picture of myself laying on it naked.
Gentlemen these are the finalists. I’m going with the angry unicorn to win bigly.
I’ve got Big Foot’s head in the next room. He’s real too.
I rather like the rainbow and sprinkles mount option.
They tell me they are quite rare!
They say only a virgin maiden can catch one, but so can a virgin old man with a gun.
Well it's all downhill from here. I think I might try my hand at golf.
I probably should have taken the shares.
Got that one at my granddaughter's birthday party.
The hunt wasn't quite as whimsical as I had hoped.
Picked it up at a white elephant exchange.
And if you move on to the living room you will see the Big-Foot rug.
It's ok. She self-identified as a horse.
I remember my Dad telling me to chase my dreams.
I bagged that one on a carousel.
I got that one on a trip to Fantasyland.
If you grab the horn, your hands will triple in size. The Viagracorn.
It's always more satisfying when it's the last of its kind.
We're all monsters.
It's eyes are opening....we should probably run...
I bagged that one at my daughter's 13th birthday party.
I'm quite proud of that one. I'm told it was the last of its kind.
I was thinning the herd.
We got this one from the same dentist that shot Cecil
..And this one just came out of nowhere from behind that old Toys R’ Us...
Actually, not one of mine. I bought it from a Leprechaun.
My daughter is a great shot!
There was glitter everywhere!
He gave me a funny look, said he was horny, so I shot him.
Yes, it was the last one. Quite the coup.
We had to sneak him through customs
Shot that one off a moving carousel at Disneyland last summer.
The safari leader promised a manticore, but well, you know how it goes.
Please don't tell my daughter about this.
We're all trying to be more eco-friendly now. I bagged this beauty on a Carousel in Central Park!
Remember that famous "Godfather" scene with a dead unicorn in the bed?
It's not real but people are really impressed by it.
I bagged this one in the 60's when I was living in the Village.
Technically it’s not an endangered species
The legend is true: Its meat tastes just like a corporate tax cut.
I just picked it up at Wal-Mart. Oh sorry, I thought you were talking about the clock.
Sure, the kids on the carousel screamed when I shot the creature, but I had to add it to my collection.
They're just animals. Wanna see my elf shrunken heads?
I spotted the middle one at the carousel, hunted high and low for him.
The horn, mane, and head are all fake, but it’s really something.
I thought he was a gnu!
I call it "My Little Pony."
Yes, my taxidermist used to work in Hollwood
Yeah, I took down that unicorn with an ice cream cone to the head.
That middle one was a particularly tough shot. He was almost completely obscured by rainbows.
It was the most ostentatiously expensive hunting tag I could buy.
I heard he was embarrassed he shot a horse, so he affixed a horn to it.
No, but one horn is better than none at all.
Not as rare as you'd think.
I found it in a Thurber story.
When it comes back to life and walks away, it'll probably do a good bit of damage to the wall.
Impressive, but it’s not My Little Pony.
Appealing to little girls just wasn't enough of an evolutionary advantage.
I was really surprised when I saw it in my yard!
I bagged it with my imaginary gun
I drew this in with a bag of Skittles.
OK, they were off of a carousel. How did you guess?
Yes, interesting story behind that one.
It was a lot like shooting a horse.
The hardest part was finding a virgin to help capture it.
Funnily, the unicorn is not as endangered as Republican Senators.
My granddaughter hates me.
It was surprisingly easy, really. All you need is a really big gun and a half-dozen or so virgins.
I went hunting for Congress's integrity, but only found this instead.
Yep, it was the only unicorn in existence. I just wish it matched my decor better.
We shot this one at Burning Man
Our diversity and inclusion program was the inspiration.
I bagged this one on the Disney Princess safari.
My daughter wanted it alive, lol.
The taxidermist was nice to charge only half because he is missing an antler.
It was a humanitarian hunt. I didn’t want the last one to be lonely
I downed it with a magic bullet.
And here I thought my daughter would be thrilled...
I don't care if it is a narwhal horn. She's still one of a kind.
Sometimes I regret poppin him one.
I thought trophy hunting was illegal at Coachella
The ice cream cone's a nice touch!
I shot that one when I was on acid.
That was my first one - I was still a virgin.
Did you buy that at the casino gift shop when you told your wife you were hunting?
And that was the day my imagination died.
She’s unreal, huh?
You should see the rest of the Carousel.
She was only flirting, and you SHOT her!
It’s my daughter’s favorite, but I really feel like it throws off the aesthetic.
Where'd you get the permit for that?
Yeah, I look like Bernie Sanders
Adding the horn certainly led to some interesting conversations.
It was a hunt I didn't want to myth out on.
I'm still hoping to add 'My Little Pony' to this collection.
Not as magical in this position.
I can never eat at Medieval Times again, but totally worth it.
"Found it poking around my Viagra.
I bagged this one while tripping in Shangri-La.
I got this one on safari with Ryan Zinke.
They're definitely not fake gnus.
The rest of it went into that frappuccino.
Took this one on an acid trip.
When it wouldn’t attend my daughter’s birthday party, I shot it.
We bagged this one on Fire Island one Halloween.
That one I got 2 weeks ago at the Playland merry-go-round.
It was a dream kill.
Oh, I bagged that one on my LSD safari in the 60's.
I got the one in the middle with my imaginary gun.
Global warming and environmental destruction are even driving mythical creatures out of their habitats.
My seven year old granddaughter bagged that one.
I knew you guys wouldn’t believe me
Let's just say, 'what happens in Disney stays in Disney.'
Can’t remember where I got but I know I was stoned out of my gourd.
I had to read a lot of fairy tales to find that one
Glad to see the new White House hunting trophies match his Time Magazine covers.
And they want to take away our guns!
This in not fake gnus.
My granddaughter Dorothy got that one when she traveled to somewhere over the rainbow.
Even the Leprechaun that did the taxidermy is doing 20 years in prison
I hear the traveling carnival still talks about the Merry-go-round Massacre of ‘85
Had to pay off the game warden with pixie dust.
I don’t care if they did donate the meat to local villagers; it gives me the creeps.
This one was like a dream come true.
Gay Gun Club’s ‘Fabulous First Meeting’
It was rather easy, just followed the trail of lucky charms and maple syrup scent.
It reminds me of my youth.
It's my way of showing support each year during Pride Week.
I haven't yet told the kids that it's fake.
Of course it's real. My daughter is a virgin.
Gentlemen, the only thing hornier than my wall is my wife.
My fantasy gaming really paid off.
I got it as part of an IPO. There are more of these than you'd think.
We call it "My little horny."
So that is what happened to My Little Pony.
Wait ‘til you see my flying pigs collection.
I bagged it for my daughter, and now she no longer speaks to me
Once upon a time...
It's as real as the other trophies you see here.
It was either him or me.
Which one of these, is not like the others?
When it charged My Little Pony I dropped it in its tracks.
It was an unbelievable safari!
And then it went public. That's how you kill a unicorn.
It’s safe to say the psilocybin has kicked in.
I used to have a centaur up here too, but nobody believed it.
The hunting bylaws said nothing about mythical creatures...
Oh, I bagged that one at a carousel in New Jersey.
African hunting trip before all the controversy; the unicorn, last year at a birthday party around the corner.
It's proof that Noah did have a couple of em aboard.
And the middle one I took down during a psychotic break last fall.
Well, who told him to offer me a wish?
Our taxidermist also did the Easter Bunny and Bambi.
I particularly like its Mona Lisa smile.
I bet it's Photoshopped.
With only one left, the extinction is not technically on me.
The hardest part of this kill was finding a virgin who could consent to act as bait.
The happiest days of my life began when she found the engagement ring on the tip of its horn there.
Guess I didn't dream it after all.
You’re imagining things I only see two heads.
And you know, at the time, I had no personal knowledge that he was the last surviving Unicorn. Didn't have a clue.
The one in the middle I shot for my granddaughter, because she told me she loves unicorns.
It's my most magical trophy yet.
To be honest, it got in the way of the elephant I was aiming at.
Two guys named Donald Jr. and Eric sold it to me.
Beautiful specimen, but it strikes me that those eyelashes might not be real.
My daughter hasn't spoken to me in weeks.
Indeed, museum quality, but maybe we should we rejoin the ladies? I think they've stopped screaming now.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the second amendment protects my right to kill mythical animals.
In my daughter’s room. 1985. Nearly impaled me.
They destroyed me for it on social media, but the hunt was FABULOUS.
unicorns don't exist, so they're not an endangered species. you can kill as many as you like
He won every derby and had a way of staying ahead of the pack.
Improbable, maybe, but the new rifle scope put out by Trump allows you to see things that aren't really there.
The President must be so proud of Donald, Jr......
I was out hunting on my unicycle and well it kinda just made sense.
The other two I shot in America recently but this one was from a happier time.
Am I drunk?
I was aiming at a Chimera.
Technically, I WAS still a virgin.
Surprisingly, they're not an endangered species.
This have really changed under Scott Pruitt
"I was stalking Big Foot ,when I ran into him".
That safari guide was REALLY expensive, but he was worth it!
They may have loosened the wildlife regulations a bit too much this time.
Ah that one ... just good luck. It turned out that our safari guide was a virgin.
No one ever asks me the story of how I shot that buck.
The hunt for this one was magical.
I found him hanging out with a mermaid.
I bagged this one as he was trying to blend in at a carousel
It’s not as big as the guide said it would be, but it was the last one.
Finding the horse is easy. Finding glue that sticks on it's head--now that's rare.
I was just a kid when I got that one. . . . Nobody'd ever believe me. So I shot it! . . . . . Proof! . . . . Biggest regret of my life.
It was him or me.
Of course, the ones on either side were fun to shoot, too.
Of course not. It's where Laura hangs her end of our costume.
God bless Ryan Zinke.
I can’t think of a single funny thing to say about this.
You just hook the 3D printer up to one of the kiddie adventure shows.
I bagged that one in days of yore.
Ok! So I’m a virgin! Don’t judge me.
I guess it really was endangered.
A gift from Don Jrs’ last hunt in Narnia!
They were never going to raise enough to save the carousel. I got there first and saved these fine trophies!
Is that the correct time?
It was a unicorn shot: you know it could happen, but you never expected it to happen.
Yup. But I lost it all on Bitcoin.
I'm just that big of a dick.
It was supposed to be "Catch & Release", but I couldn't resist.
After years of hunting, I finally got the last one!
I really thought my granddaughter would like this one, but she hasn't spoken to me since.
I didn't shoot the middle one. It bored through the wall.
That hunt was just unbelievable.
The rainbow princess would be up there, too, if my AR-15 hadn’t jammed.
I bagged it at the Cloisters.
They told me it was all in my head
Funny story - I bagged him in my daughter's room.
It does make a point.
I was aiming for a leprechaun.
I got this one at Disneyland last summer. I'm going back next month to see if I can get one of those giant mice.
Yea, I was first in that javelin competition.
You know, it's just a myth that these things poop rainbows. They don't.
Now I just need the rainbow.
Gentlemen, let's thank Don Jr. for having the hunting ban removed on endangered species
Once I finished dressing the carcass, my daughter’s birthday party resumed like nothing had happened.
He was prancing around Disney World when I shot him.
I used my 12-gauge magic wand for this one.
My granddaughter has disowned me but it’s worth it.
Yeah, I bagged this one over on Fantasy Island.
Oh, and this one I bagged just outside the princess's castle at Disneyworld!
That's why I don't take my daughter on safari.
Just a single mythical shot.
He wasn't wild about my wish.
Got a lot of hate mail from the Irish Rovers for that one.
Trump just lifted the import ban on trophies of endangered—alternative animals.
I got it on ebay.
I used the NAR specified .50 caliber max, double powder load, steel jacketed bullet, the NRA guide book, and the NRA mounting directions. It really knows its business.
Damned EPA. Endangered my ass.
Sure got my money’s worth on that Fantasy Safari.
I'm teaching my granddaughter to be a responsible gun owner
It's the one unicorn my wife would let me bring home
Actually, my pre-teen daughter shot it.
The maid is an aspiring costume and makeup artist. Last week she had the bull looking like a triceratops.
I'm trying to start a Cryptozoo.
It's not traditional, but my daughter kept asking me for one.
It wouldn’t stay out of the roses.
Don't let it be forgot that once there was a spot for happy everaftering known as Camelot.
Then they banned me from the park and the merry-go-round.
The focal point of the whole arrangement is actually the picture frame
You think that's unique. I've got a Hydra down at the taxidermist and I'm trying to figure out where to mount all the heads.
I bagged that one on the hunting trip I took with Timothy Leary.
To tell you the truth that’s not what I was aiming at.
Bagged that one in my granddaughter's backyard.
This is the only way I could get into the club.
I shot that one for my daughter.
You are imagining it. It is't really there.
Beauty mocks me, so I destroy it.
I bagged this one at Disney Studios.
I shot a leprechaun, too, but the taxidermist wouldn't stuff it.
My daughter isn’t speeking to me.
Ok, it beats My Little Pony!
Never saw one before. Haven’t seen one since.
...and that's how I got my reputation as a legendary hunter!
No, the one in the middle is a clock.
Yeah, the taxidermist said unicorns were his favorite.
Actually, many, many people are saying it's a rhinoceros.
She's from the Deep State.
And this one expired naturally on my first day of school.
...and the one in the middle I killed on our wedding night...
I tracked it down to the Conney Island merry go round
And that unique one in the middle... is a retro clock I also got at Pottery Barn.
I found this one hiding in Palo Alto. It never made it to series c.
My daughter, Becky, shot this one. She's a lobbyist for the NRA now days.
I got the Unicorn at a fundraiser event for NRA at Dick Cheney’s house in a silent auction.
I nabbed him while I was tilting at windmills.
He's trying to collect all four.
He was an elusive bugger. I finally gunned him down in my granddaughter's dreams.
I got him when I was on a drug trip.
Yep. Bagged that on on the Central Park Carousel.
Not even magic can stop a bump stock.
I bagged him at Fantasy World.
Welll , look at her She was teasing me. I am sure she wanted to be shot.
There's nothing we can't extinguish.
I guess this means one of us is a virgin.
It was a phase I grew out of.”
... and people said my glitter gun certification was a waste.
I hear they taste like chicken.
My financial advisor told me I should diversify my portfolio with a unicorn.
She was kind of a bitch...
My daughter has never forgiven me.
It was the only bullet I've ever owned
Yeah, I tried that. I ground up the tip of the horn and ate it. Didn't help my dick at all, not even a little bit. In that sense, the thing died for no reason.
I bagged that one in the jungles of Narnia, mainly for my granddaughter.
They don't taste like chicken.
I got this one for my daughter. Turns out it was just a passing interest.
The leprechaun’s head is in the shed out back.
It's a beauty, but my wife makes me take it down when our granddaughters visit.
My father was a hunter with a very powerful imagination.
He bagged it at Fantasy Hunting Camp.
I bagged the middle one for my granddaughter.
It's funny, I was actually aiming for the Pegasus.
My first unicorn!
I know both of you are sleeping with my wife. So was the unicorn.
I shot this beauty at the circus.”
It was a one in a billion shot.
And yet he had such small hooves.
The steaks were mythic.
And the one in the middle is from Neverland.
Slight faux pas with little Poppet’s Christmas list, I’m afraid.
I believe the one in the middle had an implant.
I had a leprechaun as a hunting guide.
Simply amazing. I can't believe it's 1:45 in the morning already!
God Bless the NRA.
There were some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born-- the loveliest of all was the unicorn.
Yes, my travel and hunting trips are off the beaten path.
I had second thoughts -- but I needed to fill the space.
You should see my four leaf clover collection
I shot it for my daughter's fifth birthday.
They’re actually pretty common at the end of double-rainbows
Bagged that one at a cosplay conference in Portland.
The hardest part was getting it out of the Disney studio without security seeing us
I'll tell you Jim; the rainbows PETA made me jump through...
No. But the eye-lashes are.
It may look exotic, but it tastes like horse.
She was a triple crown winner, too.
So for my third and final wish...
That was the year I joined a fantasy league.
And this one is what's left of my years as a hippie.
My daughter bagged this one to prove she was a still a virgin
My grand-daughter bagged that one in her bedroom.
My little granddaughter won't speak to me now!
It was running in circles and jumping up and down when I shot it.
This one I shot with an imaginary gun
My granddaughter bagged the one in the middle.
Fortunately, the laws against poaching unicorns are mere fantasy.
Actually, I sawed it off a carousel.
They were out of Rhinos
A filet from this one made Viagra seem like a sedative
I shot that one on some great acid.
I bagged him right after My Little Pony ran away.
It was a long shot.
Just needed to thin the herd
He just happened to be the one that stood out...
It only cost a couple of extra bucks
I think I bagged that one at Woodstock.
It was supposed to help my sex life.
Unfortunately, my granddaughter has disowned me.
Unicorns are real, my life is a myth.
I bagged this beauty at my niece's birthday party.
My first diversity safari.
Unfortunately, the efforts to save endangered species through limited hunting have not been 100% successful.
Yep, killed it with kindness.
It takes a little imagination.
The other two I killed - that one made me a killing
Don't be absurd, that's just where I like to store my waffle-cones.
That one I snagged at my granddaughter’s birthday party.
I kissed a horny toad ... hoping for My Little Pony.
The hardest part was getting the hunting license.
My daughter was furious, but I couldn't resist.
I shouldn't have
So Don Jr. does have a sense of humor.
My greatest trophy. It was worth it to remain a virgin for 70 years.
Don Jr really out did himself on this one!
Nope, apparently they’re no longer listed as endangered
Papa Smurf led us to a whole herd of them.
It languished for years in one of those s******e countries until Trump eased the import rules.
Yep, the Trump Administration Quietly Decided To Allow Unicorn Trophies...so lucky me!
And this one is unique.
I got bored of fantasy football
. . . and THIS little beauty won Best in Show at last year's Halloween Fantasy Ball. Follow me, Meg's half is in the kitchen.
Easy. I just waited outside the exchange for its stock to crash
Who’s kidding who here?
I was down to my last bullet, it was either him or the honest politician.
"I bagged that one in the middle on the way back from a Grateful Dead concert in '68.
It used to be unique. Now every CEO has one.
My daughter's been crying for a month.
So you're a virgin.
Guess what we're having for dinner?
Fake Taxidermy
I don't know why it was attracted to my wife.
If they had only chosen to breed a few more miles from the proposed pipeline...
So...existing isn't all that it's cracked up to be, after all.
My daughter caught that one.
Unique, yes. But not very.
It's no Sasquatch - but I like it.
An Antelope, an Ox, and a Unicorn walk into a bar...
You just aim at the end of a rainbow and pull the trigger. It's no wonder they're almost extinct.
It's incredible. He doesn't only want to wipe out every endangered species, he wants to kill off all fictional animals too.
Next year, I hope to bag My Little Pony.
I lured that one with a trail of Skittles.
And this is my collection for when I'm feeling horny
Who knew it was an endangered species?
To my relief, that one wasn't on the Endangered Species List either.
I'm confused. I feel like I'm on the horn of a unilemma.
Very hard to get that one. I kept tripping over rainbows.
I bagged it in Silicon Valley.
Is it any wonder he also had the biggest crowd in history at his inauguration?
From what I have heard the white ones are quite rare.
I didn’t believe it either.
Well of course unicorns exist...um..well, at least they used to.
And that one took first place in my fantasy hunting league.
That's the stuff legends are made of.
I bagged this beauty in LA at Disney studios.
Shot it in a dream
Took that one down from 200 yards. The leprechaun riding her got away.
He won the Belmont but was disqualified for using that horn.
Magical isn’t it?
How 'bout we keep Todd-opinions at Todd's house? How's that sound, Mister-on-his-fourth-wife?
Now, we need a triceratops.
No, Ted. After 32 years, my daughter still won't talk to me. I haven't a clue why.
She's a beaut. Did you bag her in Neverland?
That Carousel was a Jungle.
Big game reserve. Candyland.
Moondancer would have been worth so much more if I had kept her in the original packaging.
The one in the middle I shot while sleeping.
He was getting to old to run so I had him put down.
Is was a party hat at the last proctologists New Years Party.
It's a gift from Ryan Zinke.
That Don Jr. thinks he’s hot stuff..
Sightings are no longer rare, but it is very unusual to have evidence of an actual kill.
That was my finest moment as a great white hunter.
I bagged that one in Anaheim, with an early morning pass to Disneyland.
The people in 9B have the unpleasant ends.
My daughter was devastated...
I thought she would have a problem, but my 8-year old daughter took it with a Winchester .300 mag at 275 yards.
And the middle one I bagged on my way home from a Hallowe'en party.
We simply adored Get Out.
PETA now protects mythical creatures because of this trophy
This is the last time I visit the Oval Office.
Yes I voted for him, how’d you guess?
I bagged the middle one at Disney World.
Surprisingly, it tastes a little gamey....like CandyLand.
I bagged the middle one in the 60's just outside of Woodstock, New York
Trust me, you won't see another one of these anywhere.
Deer were out of season.
What's the point?
Understandably, Aslan will be upset.
I was going to let it go, but then I remembered how I hated that song...
Sure, she tried hiding, but my bullet pierced right through that rainbow.
I’m terribly sorry to say the little girl this belonged to was not happy at all about this.
I sold the hooves to make super-super glue.
Bagged it at my daughters birthday party
Look again gentlemen and choose wisely. Left; we have the fast one. Who just lost the race. Right; we have incredible strength. Now the butchers bull. In the center; we have the ability to ride rainbows. Plus the horn thing.
Wow, even mythical creatures need to fear hunters.
Endangered species? We didn't have that in my youth.
It gets harder and harder to draw attention to how sick you are these days.
Of course I used an extinct weapon. To do otherwise would be pointless.
I call her, 'American Dream.'
I was aiming for the rainbow.
She wanted to mount the horse. The horn was my idea.
See, proof that fantasies never last forever.
So, are you really a virgin?
The day I bagged ol Buttercup here, I stopped being just a dentist...... I was a real man. “You need help Walter
Endangered, damn right he was, that why he's on the wall!
We wanted a creature we could fit onarwhal.
You think that's impressive! Wait until I show you my fishing trophies!
I wish there wasn't a no selfie policy here.
Not sure if I should say this, but it kind of makes me horny...
Here at Mar-a-Lago, it's open season on enchantment.
Well, how was I to know it was in costume for my granddaughter’s “Princess and the Unicorn” birthday party?
They tell me I shot the last one.
I've also got a centaur in the dining room.
So, they said, your $40,000 hunting fee will go toward preserving the species. After I shot it I found out this was the last of the species. Of course, the value has ballooned considerably.
I bagged that one in my daughter's playroom!
It was a dream hunting trip.
I bagged the middle one on November 7, 2016.
Say John, how's that new Volvo treating you?
My granddaughter hasn't spoken to me in three decades.
I bagged that one while on acid back in 1966.
And that's what's left of Theranos
The President made it legal to hunt for these.
My taxidermist is also in my fantasy league.
My granddaughter wasn't too crazy about this one.
It was a dream come true.
he had a great career when it depended on a photo finish
1967, the Magical Mystery Tour
I see you take your daughter hunting.
Who is the Democrat, the Republican, and the independent?
After spending thousands on unsuccessful hunts, I finally gave up and bought one online.
And this one was shot by Trump Jr.
Of course I had to go through the wardrobe for that one.
The Kochs posted a bounty and one of the Twit-in-Chief’s sons collected on 16 June 2015. I got it at a garage sale.
She changes colors every Monday.
Where did you say you were from again?
This one has a story you won't believe.
Daughter Number 2 still won't talk to me.
Funny story, I was actually aiming at my granddaughter.
My guy touched it up a little with Taxidermi-Shop.
She offered three wishes if I set her free... but I didn't want to get greedy.
I heard they captured it at the Neverland Ranch
A buck, a unicorn and a bull walk into a bar . . .
I'm mellowing. I shoot only imaginary animals these days.
I bagged that one at my daughter's 13th birthday party.
Well, they’re rarer now!
Surprisingly, my daughters don't ask me for a "My Little Pony" anymore...
Took it down it with an ice cream cone at 200 yards. Two scoops. One shot.
My daughter bagged that one.
I bagged that one years ago at FAO Schwarz.
The fact that it was the last one makes it so much more rewarding.
There is something vaguely masculine about this one.
Well I'd say that decorator nailed our spirit animals!
And was I ever lucky, I got him with my last shot!
See I told you unicorns existed.
He offered me a wish then I said it's to mount him!
No it didn't work, I am still gay.
Who would have thought having less of something would make you more important.
last of its kind but hey at least it’s not a famous lion
Who’s the mythical magical one now!?!
They're great for hanging wet clothes over the fire.
... and that's why Kevin was banned from the zoo.
As it turns out, my wife had something else in mind.
Sometimes I'm glad we live in the Matrix.
We're going for My Little Pony in the fall.
Thank goodness I was carrying my gun when I inspected that mysterious wardrobe.
Mounting one of these has always been a fantasy of mine.
Say--that's a nice looking clock you have there. Ever consider selling it?
Now the story behind this one is something magical...
And that, gentlemen, is how I knew that my bride-to-be was, in fact, a virgin.
Found it in my bed when Gollum tried to make me an offer I couldn't refuse. Precious.
He was guarded by a bunch of overweight painted ponies, but they provided little resistance.
Actually, that one was in the garden.
So it turned out rainbow dash was not a distance runner
To be fair, I don't like the other two, either.
Who invited the black guy?
I shot that at an arcade.
She said she came a magic land, and asked me to make a wish.
Me and the boys bagged this ol’ girl back in the ‘60s.
....it was Woodstock, '69. She was my first love, and knew I couldn't let her get away.
Took a cartridge with a double wad of fairy dust to bring that one down.
Even rarer to find a virgin!
Not as rare to spot as you think back in the 60s.
The brochure called it 'Safarnia'
It was eating lilies in the Thurber's garden, when I shot it.
This guy could be a real pain in the butt.
Wait until you see the humpty back camel
Yeah, I got this one hunting in Silicon Valley.
What's your daughter gonna say?!" "She's the one that mounted it
If only I had that much hair.
No, you aren't wrong, it could be a horse. That just doesn't make me feel any better about it.
Unfortunately, the zebracorn got away.
I’m on the Ministry of Magic’s hit list.
So,... there I was in the kingdom of Magic Muffins, nothing but sugar puff fairies for days and on the final day we found her and I shot her dead BAM !
My daughter may only be eight but she’s already a great shot.
The interior designer was from Silicon Valley.
Lured it in with a recording of my granddaughter's birthday party and then, BANG.
He was a non-breeder, anyways.
Trophy hunting isn't about the circle of life, though the middle one is about the carousel.
It's the Ivanka of my collection.
I sighted him horsing around at a New Year's party.
I bagged him at the Central Park Carousel.
Who would have thought? But stranger things are happening every single day.
You calling the police on this Negro or shall I?
No, Artemis bagged that one.
Unicorn? Damn! I thought it just lost one of its horns in a fight!
Of course, as you may know, ‘Uni’, means ‘One’
It was at the Mardi Gras. She was wearing this as a costume.
It was a one in a billion shot.
When I was a kid, they convinced me to become a believer. So I did.
Yes, it's a rare cross between a Game of Thrones and a Westworld.
Ahh. Represents a start-up company valued at more than a billion dollars, typically in the software or technology sector.
I said hell with the children's cartoon people. I've got my rights, too.
And he expects us to believe that the others are real???
Well, he wasn’t eligible for the Belmont Stakes so....
And I thought the Passenger Pigeon was a bit tacky.
And then the damned horse galloped right into my awl.
So Phil told us to look and see if we notice anything special. All I see is a clock that’s 5 minutes fast!
I bagged it the same year the Cubs became World Series champions, something else I didn't believe could exist.
And the middle one was my little pony.
Those little girls cried and cried.
My granddaughter knows her way around a Remington.
Truth be told, the snuffleupagus was a more elusive hunt.
He brought them back from his “dream vacation”.
It's amazing what a 4 year old girl can accomplish, when you tell her that none of the Disney Princesses believe in them.
Yep, I bagged him with unishot!
I know, they're everywhere now. Maybe I should move it to the den.
White House tour guide; "...and here in the 'Trump Sons Trophy Room' we have the wild Bluebuck, the Rainbow Unicorn and the Aurochs; all extinction now."
She was elusive, but, once I said I believed, it was smooth sailing.
I heard his wife is a Mermaid.
The man was startled, though he retained his composure. "Gentlemen, am I mad, or did that bear in the middle suddenly turn into an . . . oddly attractive unicorn?" To which the unicorn replied, "Darling, we all go a little mad sometimes."
I bagged that one on safari at a theme park.
And I keep Bigfoot in my half-man cave.
When they said there was a bag limit of one, I didn't know they meant a bag limit of one.
Ah, yes, the LEAST dangerous game...
Yup, got it at the Trump Mirage going out of business sale.
It had a rainbow coming out of its ass but we had trouble figuring out how to wall mount that part.
Do you think they're thinking the same thing we're thinking?
Don't feel so uppity now, do ya?
You mounted the wrong end. I heard they shit rainbows!
It challenges the old saying: Two Horns are Better than One"
Big game hunting? More like Dungeons & Dragons...
Dude, I though you had something else in mind when you said you were horny.
My wife left me after this one.
The virgin is still at the taxidermist
I wore this one in the Mardi Gras parade.
Yup ... it was like taking candy from a baby.
I love a singularity.
I was aiming for a handsome Gnu, but this creature took the bullet for him.
She almost talked me out of it.
I guess it wasn’t fake news after all...
Females are impossible. My daughter said she wanted a unicorn, and then she complained when I got this.
That's nice... Did you hear we have a Manchurian president and democracy's dead?
Looks like Republicans are changing their views on diversity.
I finally feel secure in my masculinity.
It was during Mardi Gras after my third Sazerac.
... and that's no bull, Chad.
Talk about your fantasy hunting trip !
They told me they weren't endangered.
I still want something more exotic.
It was just nice to have that father-daughter bonding time.
After seeing the rainbow, I then reached for my lollipop.
When you tickle her nose, she sneezes rainbows.
Annika was crying pretty hard, which makes her accuracy all the more impressive.
Hemingway must have been drinking.
Bagged her at the end of the rainbow.
My granddaughter was very upset with me.
Most of these animals were killed with a hunting rifle but this one was shot with a rain-bow.
I bagged him at Disney World.
Don't worry—it was the SECOND to last unicorn.
Life gave me no advantages, just two loving parents, money and education. Yet, I clawed my way to the top. The unicorn is my spirit animal.
I was hoping to get one with two.
There was a virgin too, but she got away
One guess what tonight's dessert is.
It just appeared there in November, 2016.
I always thought those unicorn crossing signs were a joke, but I put my blind up, and...
My daughter wanted to keep it as a pet, but I told her they cannot be tamed.
It really ties the room together
Joe's from which part of Tanzania, again?
If you find this hard to believe, you should see the parking spot I found this morning.
Yeah, they discovered him in Thurber's garden.
From where I was standing, I could have sworn it was a rhinoceros.
There's a horny display if ever there was one.
In my freezer I have the rainbow ice cream she was pooping when I killed her too.
The unicorn is from a carousel I got when I foreclosed on a Shriners' hospital.
Yes, it is endangered, but my son is the game warden.
No one believed it was real until she came home with this.
Amazingly when they shipped it back we learned it was a transgender...what a bonus!
I bagged that one outside of Hogwarts!
I thought the highlights would make her eyes pop.
I thought my granddaughter would be impressed, but she just ran away in tears.
Ah, our goodwill hunting expedition!
She was captured just before boarding the ark.
I got it for one bitcoin.
Her eyes are following me.
“ I only shot this one because it crept up on me from behind to give me a nudge”.
Dave's fake game trophies always create an awkward atmosphere. Wait till you see the elephant in the other room
And here I graduated from 'butcher' to 'myth buster'.
I grant you that My Little Ponies aren't an endangered species, but it's still crossing the line to shoot one.
I bagged that one during my Timothy Leary period.
He was coming right at me.
To answer your question, that is why this is a 'No Daughters Room'.
Bagged that one in my dreams.
My new taxidermist is a Harry Potter fan.
Strange-I’ve never seen another since I bagged this one!
That one was for the chicks.
The Irish Rovers bagged that one with a sure hit way back in ‘68.
During my youth, I discovered him and idolized him. During my third mid-life crisis, I shot him.
The wings are coming back from the dry cleaner
So now you know why it appears that I have two belly buttons.
Yeah... Turns out that the horn is fake.
The Narnia trip was Mildred's idea, actually.
Don't worry, this is only the second to last.
I suppose that proves that they WERE real.
I had to endure a 2 hour train ride with a bunch of brats, fight off giant spiders and had to chose between this and a centaur, but I think it was worth all of that!
Damned EPA. Endangered my ass.
The older I get the shorter the unicorn season seems to be.
This one’s from our last visit to Narnia — before Aslan ruined it with all that “eco-tourism” nonsense.
Nailed that puppy on a brutal midnight raid in Silicon Valley
Would you look at that! They finally let in a black person.
The hardest part was leaving the foals behind.
It's a lot, but not a cornucopia.
Yeah, I heard they were making a comeback, I just couldn’t let that happen.
Had to lie perfectly still for nineteen hours in a flowery meadow to make that shot.
Hey Walt, how's the dental practice going?
My daughter thinks it’s tacky.
Bagged that one just north of Anaheim.
Actually, that one's just from an old carousel....
Bagged that beauty last year in Trumplandia
Yes, my very first GMO. Trouble is, it came out with the body of a ferret
In fact, I did lobby Trump for the elimination of all regulations on the importation of trophies of mythical beasts.
I was hunting with Jim Thurber the day he mythed the beast.
Got him off the endangered species list.
My daughter wishes I was dead.
So hear you'll see Rudolph, a Unicorn and Ferdinand. When we punish our kid we go all in.
She was my Heart of Darkness
Our grand daughter's a great shot and a real American Girl.
Slaughtered that one for our daughter!
You only get one shot
Rare? No, I'd rather have it well done.
That trip was my granddaughter's idea
I know, I know: I shouldn't have shot it...
And I bagged this fellow back in '69 when I was doing lots of acid.
This one I got in magic mountain spring semester 1967
But now my all the little grandkids refuse to speak to me.
Thirty-ought-six, 12 gauge, and the Talisman of the Magi.
I shot that one in 1969; the acid was SO much better in those days
Of course, my granddaughter has never forgiven me.
I shot her in my dreams.
I’m a little surprised you shot a one pointer.
You know, they were considered "Endangered" till the Trump Administration.
NOW do you believe it wasn't just an acid trip...
She's not a unicorn. It's just a leftover from her merry-go-round days.
I met that one in group therapy.
So we drained the swamp, and guess what?
Yeah, protections are pretty lax these days
An environmentalist he wasn't.
Well, it’s always a conversation starter.
I know it’s wrong, but I needed something to replace the Phoenix.
Don’t let the rainbow mane fool you. They’re predators. Look there, you can see it in the eyes.
Rather than debate its mythical beginnings, anyone up for a game of ring toss?
This one is very rare.
I bought it from a deli owner going out of business. He used to keep bagels on it.
It would be hard to find the right bait today.
Next year I'm going to get a Sasquatch.
My eyes are just not what they used to be. They do shoot horses, don't they?
The one on the left was my Kenya trip and the middle one was my favorite acid trip.
Next season, I'm bagging a pegasus.
"Took me three spells and two wand waves to bag this baby"!
I bagged that baby at The Cloisters.
I think all this caffeine is driving me insane.
If I told you I bagged that one during a stampede you'd think I was fabricating a myth.
my wife's hairdresser thought it hadn't caught up with modern fashion
That center one was a tough kill compared to the deer & cow
All this time I thought gazelles weren’t real.
In my day we 'd call 'em Betty Davis eyes
You remember that dentist that killed Cecil the lion for a trophy? I think I outdid him!
Yeah, but Bambi got away.
Phoebe is gonna be really upset with you.
The centerpiece is from my Fantasy Safari."
Even her glue was full of glitter.
I took LSD once while I was hunting.
Maybe we should get out of here.
It kind of took the pain off of remaining a virgin for all these years.
They said it was the last one.
You didn't tell us you had a trophy wife.
She was our daughter's favorite growing up, so I didn't want it to get away.
The Loch Ness monster is next on my list.
The rainbows are in the den.
What makes you think I'm a fraud?
Didn't shoot that one, just told her about Trump.
As you can see, our imagination, too, has been hunted to extinction.
I have an erection.
It's a cross between a horse and a narwhale
Who's mythic now?
Shouldn't it be 'unihorn?'
The meat tasted like dreams and rainbows.
Actually, it wasn't that elusive.
A real disappointment... the meat tastes just like chicken.
I got a really good deal from a Toys R Us store.
It took a bit of doing but we nailed it on the back lot of Universal Studios
I think their going too far with Fantasy Sports...Fantasy Hunting! Really?
And to think it took a Catholic, a Jew, and a Muslim. Cheers.
My neighbor, in the apartment next door said he was drilling a hole for a TV wall mount, but then gave up and said I could just keep the drill bit.
I couldn’t believe it either. I was hunting snipe!
Right. Magic. Pelosi and the Democrats are going to need some of that in November.
He claims no virgins were involved
Now you know why I never took the kids on my theme park trips.
Dude, did that just move?
I know they're endangered, but just one couldn't matter so much.
Nailed that little beauty with a virtual reality scope.
I won that from Peter S. Beagle. Straight flush.
I must admit I may have been under the influence of some psychotropic drugs at the time.
Because of that my young daughter never spoke to me again
I bagged that one in my daughter's dreamcatcher.
Actually my grand-daughter helped with this one...
He truly was a unicorn.
I had both the Unicorn and a Pegasus in my sights, but the Pegasus flew off when I fired.
I don't know what's worse: faking one or killing one.
You just can't set your sights till you stop the merry go round.
My daughter shot that one. An enchanted forest east of Dayton.
A little gene splicing here and there and see what you get.
The middle specimen is on loan from Don Jr.'s endangered species collection.
I bagged that one on a fake hunting trip with Trump Jr.
It got too real when the rainbows started pouring out of her eyes.
Anything is possible on an alternate species safari.
The only one ever sighted; so of course I shot it!
That may have had something to do with my daughter's estrangement.
The others ones are from Swaziland, but this one I bagged in LaLaLand
Unihorn rolls off the tongue so much better than Unicorn.
He was right about the tax cuts too.
Well I guess the tech bubble finally burst.
This one was actually road kill
I'd had a little too much to drink and thought it was a Rhinoceros.
I keep the virgin in the basement.
It's not real
There was that time back in college when I experimented with big gay hunting.
Martha we need gun control.
That one was easy to bag, it kept running in circles.
Ira, I love what you've done with the place.
I checked, it's not on the Endangered Species List.
I sold the mate for the Sasquatch on the opposite wall.
No, the one on the right is a cow.
You realize this announces to everyone that you are a virgin.
I got this one in the Trump alternative reality bubble.....
...and we got a pint of boysenbery syrup from the liver and three-dozen licorice whips from the tail.
It was him or me.
It's my one tangible memory of the Summer of Love. Still trying to come to terms with it.
I lost my virginity the very next weekend.
My wife wanted to add a touch of whimsy.
Took him down at Disney World with my bare hands and a chain saw.
As soon as Trump relaxed the trophy import ban on these guys, I was like, who needs elephant tusks.
It was her eyes, I think, that spoke to me.
Looks like he was trying to make a point.
I hunted that one when I was on safari in Hollywood.
I caught this one sleeping with my wife.
My granddaughter just announced she’s vegan.
The secret is the willing suspension of disbelief.
"It's not about race".
You guys think that’s amazing, in the next room I have a fully mounted Big Foot.
Appalling, but it jump-starts conversation.
Pruitt says you can bait them with peppermints and sugar cubes.
"Donald Jr. and Eric with the help of the Russians killed those animals and Daddy knew it.!
Martha still insists she bagged that one--poor dear. We put a marker in the garden where she said it happened.
That hardest part was tracking down the mythical bullets.
“Ah yes, the Tibetan Red Deer, the Albanian Musk Ox, and the Arctic Unicorn. A shame that I’ll never get the new big four with the demise of the Hawaiian Poi Dog.
We'll never have a hunt like that again.
His rear end in the other room is even better.
It was a "one of a kind" find!
These guys seem really impressed but they should see the two unicorns Don shot. And Eric landed a beautiful mermaid that's now mounted at Mar a Lago
Show-off.
Without the entire carousel...the elements of art are lacking.
What's this? My little phony?
Heard from PETA and PFLAG about this one.
This one really upset my daughter.
Toys R Us clearance sale, 2018.
I sometimes feel bad about the other two, but he's mythelogical.
It's sad, really. Sparkle went off the deep end when they canceled 'My Little Pony,' and we had to put her down.
Phoebe isn't pleased.
The Unicorn kind of makes sense but I don't know why you would use your other two wishes on those other mounts.
It’s from fantasy hunter’s camp.
Trump's hunting deregulation extends even to mythical animals.
I got that one during the Father/Daughter 'Indian Princess' Weekend.
The Minotaur got away
When I had him in my sights, it was like being in a fairy tale.
I thought the only one left was in the White House.
My daughter really likes her AK47
It may be unique, but the kudu is a better hat rack.
Yes it's the last unicorn and it was shot at a Trump golf course.
I don't care what Terry says. He hit it with his car and is too embarrassed to tell us.
We have updated our privacy policy.
Let’s just say I went for the brass ring on this one.
You know, I'd describe it as a gamier version of Yeti.
Just one bite of those funky fairy-tale mushrooms, and I saw her. The 3D printer did the rest.
Of course we didn't shoot it. It was T-boned by a flying saucer.
And if we go out back, we'll see Nessie in the koi pond.
…. and this one I found in a small bar in New Orleans.
We took our daughter's Girl Scout troop hunting.
So this is where the magic happens
This one I accidentally hit while riding my magic carpet.
It's too bad they don't have an EPA in Atlantis.
I salvaged it from an old merry-go-round — far and away my best hunting story.
It was for my granddaughter; we haven't spoken lately.
Turns out it was full of glitter.
Never bring your 6-year-old niece to Brimfield.
When Ivanka was a little girl, shesaid she wanted a unicorn.....I think Eric and Donald Jr. Misunderstood.
It’s quite the accomplishment, but is anyone else confused that Jim keeps referring to it as a homosexual rhino?
Note the orange mane!
I shot this one during my safari through Silicon Valley
"It's sacred, yes, but I had to slay it for the non-believers".
Cheney bagged that one.
... and this one was while on acid in the gumdrop forest.
Took him down with a single shot at my oldest daughter’s birthday party.
...that's when I realized, it was kill or be killed.
I don't know, man - it was almost 50 years ago - I was on LSD and I thought I saw two horns.
Yeah, well our 'sweet' little Jenny got sent home for putting him down at Magic Camp.
"This was a gift from the President and his son
You should've seen the merry-go-round operator's face. A but horrified...but priceless.
Just spotting one wasn't easy.
Probably shouldn’t have, as it was the only female left in the world, but you learn from your mistakes, don’t you ?
Bagged that one on the trip to Fantasy Island
Took some real shooting. Must've been four or five little girls on her back at the time.
I'm super proud of getting the last unicorn before their extinction.
Yes it was hard shooting her, but she looked so stuck-up.
If you like this one, you should see the baby seals I have in the other room.
My granddaughter went with me on my last safari.
Do you notice anything out of place?
I bagged this one at the carnival.
Don't worry, it's faux. It's really pegasus head with manticore horn attached. I'm not a monster, you know.
Next on my list is Big Foot, the Lock Ness Monster, and the Male White Rhino.
I know somebody caught it, but I don't believe in unicorns.
Have you heard the one about the antelope, unicorn, and steer walk into a bar?
They don't really exist, so technically I didn't kill and endangered species.
I told you unicorns were real.
Oh it's nothing. Just wait until you sit down for dinner.
I caught this one in my sleep.
Hardest part was getting through Magic Rainbow customs.
I regret having shot that one, since it has only one horn.
Jimmy’s Large Game Farm aims to please.
I wonder what they did with the rest of it...
Sadly, this one was just a cosplay.
I bagged that one in the Hamptons.
That was the day I drank the Kool-Aid.
Fun fact: they bleed rainbows.
The wager was he didn't exist. I won.
I suppose I need a refill on my meds
My granddaughter helped.
I got it at Target
Believe it or not, it was easier than finding the next Uber.
It illustrates our commitment to racial and sexual diversity.
He was the fraternity brother who always had to stand out from the crowd
What a prick!
Trophy hunter's stab at Trompe-l'oeil?
Got her when I was just a kid. Ain't seen one since.
Pretty sure he was the last one.
It was me or him.
Yeah, the grandkids aren’t allowed in this room anymore
I bagged this one on my trip—to Disneyland.
I got a tip on where to find this one from my daughter's fairy tale book.
His body? Otherworldly, I tell you. And what a sense of humor.
Sure it makes my grandchildren cry, but all those years of tracking rainbow poop, I've got to hang it.
They told me you had to be a virgin to catch one, so I shot it.
It's a rotten world. Our eyes met and we fell in love the moment before I killed her.
You wouldn’t believe the taxidermist’s bill.
Call me a coastal elitist, but I just don't believe in this kind of thing.
Just a reminder of my non-trophy start-up company.
It's one of the advantages of living in silicon valley.
And I killed this one by driving a carrot through its skull.
I barely outbid my granddaughter for this baby
Ah yes, the rare Bored Unicorn. I bagged this one at an accountant's convention.
I found this lovely creature under a rainbow smelling like lavender and caramel.
And that's how I became strong enough to make my fourth horcrux.
I'm at the top of the fantasy world's most wanted list.
I really thought I was dreaming when I got him in my sight.
In Fake NewzZealand
A centrist unicorn . . . seems to make sense.
I got lucky—there were a limited number of permits available this year.
I bagged this one at Woodstock!
I convinced my daughter it was a rhino.
Watching it die was magical.
It wasn't until later that I noticed his party hat.
Of course, it's a plastic replica. But it's still my favorite.
My niece's boyfriend works for Pruitt Taxidermy. I have a bald eagle in the library.
A non-existent trophy.......very Zen.
This one, I shot her on my last acid trip.
It tasted a bit like Mermaid, but not as fishy.
Big game hunting is such a magical sport.
I guess one horn toots better than two
Bagged this one in Central Park, at the merry-go-round. What a beauty, this one.
Yeah, all my grandchildren disowned me afterwards, but it was worth it.
Real hunters use a rainbow and arrow.
Well, it was either this or the Medusa.
This one is truly one of a kind.
It was the only one of the species, so of course, I couldn't help but kill it before someone else did!
He was a rare find.
... of course, not everybody sees the point.
I don't know, Bob. This isn't what I had in mind when I asked for something one-of-a-kind.
My granddaughter hasn’t been back since she saw it.
Just a little reminder that magic is bullshit.
I bagged this one near a food cart Portland.
Seeing my kids not on their phones is rarer.
I was lucky - the current Administration shrank the Endangered Species List.
I searched the globe and it turns up at a local fairground
The real prize was the look on them kids faces
I bought my daughter an AR-15 for her birthday, and I have to say, she's really taken to it.
I mistakenly shot two white rhinos before finally catch her
The most dangerous game is a child's imagination.
Bagged it in Silicon Valley just before it went on Endangered Species list.
You'd think it'd be more of a chick magnet.
Research has shown extinction is the most reliable form of preservation.
The toughest part of the hunt is finding a virgin.
... a dreamcatcher and some tripwire.
Well, you guys needled me so much, I had to kill her to prove that she indeed, existed!
My daughter bagged that one. Of course, she was much younger then.
After I grazed her, it was fairly easy to track her down thanks to the trail of sparkles.
Well, Walt, she’s not as controversial as Cecil.
Have you ever played Two Truths and a Lie?
My son got this one after his tech company's IPO.
Well, it wasn’t a tough shot. He was all alone in a small corral.
Now there's none left.
I think it's fine, but I'll have to have a talk with my daughter.
Yes, it's a vanishing species, but what the hey!
Abby was worried that no one in her class would believe her.
I caught this one with a dream catcher.
I bagged this one while tripping on LSD in college.
It was magical for a while.
I got the last one!
You had a gun in Florida?
And that’s why the president has made hunting great again.
The eyes are brown, but other than that it’s pretty rare.
I got it on the cheap. The Queen of Hearts had just 'off with his head'.
The strangest thing ... when I shot him invading my grandsons birthday party, the bottom half ran off.
I named her Theranos, because she still doesn’t know she’s dead.
I really don't understand hunting. What's the point?
I've the rainbow too... but my accountant said that I would need to declare it so I keep it in my garage.
The unicorn's a female. You can tell by her eyelashes.
Turns out North Korea wasn’t lying
Well, I told you unicorns were real
I'd think there would have to be at least two more, somewhere.
My daughter didn’t speak to me for two weeks.
Behold, gentlemen, the hunting club’s first trophy, right off the ark.
The rainbow I shot is still at the taxidermist.
It was quite a fight. You should see the narwhal.
That day, I proved that I was the TRUE legend.
It may look cute now but you should have seen it charge!
Having grandkids can be rewarding.
I made a killing on a leveraged buyout of a carousel company.
No one saw it coming
He stopped running when he went through our wall.
It feels as it were yesterday; it was a hot day in a place called Disneyland...
Bagged him hiding behind a rainbow in a bunch of bubbles.
I bagged him right out from under Princess Eleanor!
I had a clear shot at the Yeti till this dummy got in the way.

Yeah I got the last one alive on earth, right between the eyes.
I can't tell you where I bagged that one.

My wife mounted these. I don't know why.
The two-horn unicorn is even rarer.

Tom's horn is bigger
I beat Donald, Jr. and Eric to the draw.
It was either him or me.
I found that one lurking in a closed amusement park hiding among horses and pigs who were all drawn up in a circle.
Point well taken!
I consider myself a taxidermy disrupter. For this Unicorn I styled the mane after 80's hair bands and the smokey eye, my wife.
Roughly translated? “One corn.”
Here I thought "killing a unicorn" was just a euphemism.
I just glued it on.
My youngest daughter got that one

It’s a Howard Miller.
His trophy wife.
Bagged him on safari in Brigadoon back in '54.
This one had me going around in circles before I could bring her down.
A shame, I know. I was aiming for the gryphon. Aside from that though, the Sixties were a great decade.
You know that Disney World isn’t a hunting reserve, right?
An unfortunate ricochet, actually.
Well, sure, it was a breathtakingly magical blessing of wonderment until, ya know, I shot her with the AR-15.
Reminds me of my late MaryBeth, just prettier, kinder and more natural. Oh, and much sweeter, of course.
The rainbow soft serve dispenser is on the other side of the wall.
Our our safari we paid for the endangered species supplement.
My PH said might as well go ahead, it's the last one anyway.
I'd give my left nut to hear its death rattle again. Sweet!
The weird thing is that I still have to feed it.
Likely a phony, but was a bargain.
Let me guess... Donald Trump, Jr.
...and then I said, quixotic my ass!
I did the taxidermy myself. She was impressive in the wild, "last of her kind" and all, but nothing as impressive as this.
He was riding a unicycle when I bagged him!
Wow! This is UNREAL!
You're not going to believe this....

By 'unicorn hunting' I thought you meant you were in venture capital.
No, I certainly wouldn't have had I known how rare they are.

It may look pretty now but it was really mean when I tried to kill it.
The tough part was finding a virgin.
It was a toss-up, and the Cyclops lost; so, we hung him in my man cave.
The grandkids don't understand.
In retrospect, the bragging rights aren't worth the cost, but what's done is done!
It’s like the Mona Lisa. No matter where you stand, her horn follows you.
I won’t tell you what I was on when I bagged that one.
So tragic: she died of a glitter overdose.
I bagged the contract on the next Trump hotel when I saw her on the savanna herding  Donald Jr. and Eric at horn-point like a pair of scared goats.
I knew something was off when it wouldn’t die.
A memento from my VC days.
It's kind of scary what they can do with the new crispr gene technology.
I swam with mermaids and danced with fairies so this was naturally next.
It’s just a placeholder until I get a rhinoceros.
I also caught a rainbow that day, but I haven’t been able to mount it yet.
I got that on Amazon Prime.
This has always been my fantasy.
I should probably just lend the neighbors a stud finder.
Goes best with Syrah.
It lacks a human element.
That's my first billion dollar startup.
And I bagged this one on my last trip to Equestria.
Now there no unicorns.
It's so much better than a green alligator, a long-necked goose, a humpy-backed camel, a chimpanzee, or cats, and rats, and elephants.
...back then hunting unicorns was legal.
My granddaughter was most distraught when she saw me come home with this one . . .
Ah, yes... A memento from my last ill-fated investment scheme.
I think the taxidermist scammed me
At first I lowered my gun...then thought, what the Hell, these things aren't on the endangered species list.
It was no big deal. If you’ve bagged one, you’ve bagged them all.
Of course this one is my most fantastic trophy.
. . . and the one in the center is from Coachella, 2015.
I spotted him at the end of an outstanding rainbow.
That's right. I shot two in Africa, and the other was a gift from my husband.
I have one of those. The women love it.
Trump just signed an executive order classifying this as an endangered species.
OMG! Men are all the same...they act like they've never seen a horn before! "Hey Buddy! My eyes are down here!"
It’s not from hunting. It’s from investing!
Couldn't be sure it was real until I dropped him.
Adhering to our zero waste policy, after we harvest the snot, we taxidermy the head.
If I could have, I would have mounted the rainbow as well.
He kept chasing that dream until he got it.
I was aiming for the zebra, but I was blinded by the rainbow.
It really compliments the griffinskin rug.

Nope, I speared it through the ass
Just a campaign donation, then he's a freebie at Trump safari resort.
I bagged that one before Wakanda joined the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
When I asked for a Unicorn I meant a trendy cup of coffee.
Honestly, from the ad I really thought I was getting a white rhino.
And I bagged this bad boy at Disneyland.
Son, when I said you should start investing in unicorns, this isn’t what I meant.
I'll take a bath on the IPO, but it's a great conversation piece.
Bagged this one in Hello Kitty-land; the safari guide was a leprachaun named Doug.
Shooting her was easy. Getting to Equestria was the hard part.
You should've seen the one that got away.
And to think it was pink too!
The hard part was finding the virgin.
And thats our old mare horsing around in a Holloween hat
It's true, when you break their necks they actually do shit rainbows.
Of course she’s less horny than the stag.
I'm after a flying pig next.
Botswana on the left, Wyoming on the right, Orlando in the middle.
I shot this one in Oz.
It was so beautiful, I just had to shoot it.
That middle one was here when we bought the house!
Sure the spiraling horn is magical, but those lashes and those eyes...
It's actually just a horse. The horn and eyelashes were added by the taxidermist.
Transgender, I suspect.
My guide said it was the only one, and I hated my dental practice...
If it's a racial comment, I don't get the point.
Got this guy at the amusement park last summer.
Actually, I started with fish in a barrel and worked my way up.
Yeah, that's pretty Insta-worthy.
Surprisingly, it tasted just like griffin.
I lured it with my flying pigs.
I'm very proud of getting the last one.
I bagged this beauty on my most recent trip to Narnia.
From last weeks contest- just thought of it and wanted someone to appreciate it even though I missed the deadline. "Welcome to Hell. Please watch this short orientation video before we begin.”
A broad streak of glitter runs in the veins of the Cadwaladers.
I am not sure I can trust our host.
It was the only one in the world......and I killed it for your pleasure.
I wonder if it actually pooped rainbows.
Back in my youth they weren't so rare, I wonder what changed?
And this one I hit with my car just outside Forks, Washington.
No, in my mind that’s a rhino.
The hardest part was finding a virgin to use for bait.
I'm told it was the last monohorn
Like most of us he used to have a pair.
Oh no rudolf
I can’t keep it at my house, my daughter would never speak to me again.
I bagged her in 1961 on the singles weekend in the Catskill Mountains when I met your mother.
I felt guilty at first, but it really matches my new pillows.
Nothing says "hunting" like an AK47 with the large magazine clip
I bagged this one on a trip to my daughter's room.
It's missing a horn, but I still like it.
Magical creature, my ass.
and that's why they arent around anymore...
I won 'Special Mention' in the 'Sincerely Held Belief' category for that one ...
I caught this one on Halloween
No, I was unaware that they're endangered. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have herds of them.
I got it on safari in Silicon Valley.
That one was the easiest. It just stood there, staring at my gun in disbelief.
... and that ended me questioning my sexuality.
I found her on Tinder.
The merry go round was never quite the same afterwards
I bagged the middle one at a Dead concert in'68.
No, it came with the kid's ringtoss game.
Would you believe it’s actually a donkey in drag?
She got tails in the divorce.
I caught this one in Shangri La with my Wonder Woman lasso
We had a terrific guide!
My one trip to Silicon Valley
The hat was his idea
This one, I hunted in the wilds of Coney Island.
This side is better.
"Bagged that one in Silicon Valley last December".
I’m not impressed. They used rainbow blinds and marshmallow feeders.
" You guys should see what's on the other side of the wall ".
Well now THAT one was quite a story...
Clearly, the @MeToo movement is taking on new challenges.
Got drunk one night when I was in college and stole it from a carousel. Kept it, though, because I think it adds a bit of magic to my collection.
She's not as horny as they are!
I heard they found it while they were staying at Lake Loch Ness...
You'll notice I didn't shoot it for the ivory.
I threw this one in for the people who don't like real animals heads.
That is certainly a unique horn !
Actually I nabbed that one the traditional way by wooing him with a virgin
Unfortunately, I shot it pre-IPO.
He’s a Picasso version!
Cecil the Lion was small potatoes.
And this is where I hang my keys.
This one almost flew away.
It was a beautiful shot.
Had to do it. One-horn LOSER!
That's either an "alternative fact" or "opposing truth."
Endangered, shmendangered!
And the next weekend I lost my virginity.
I caught that one in the late 90s, right before the dot-com bubble burst.
I swear it sometimes winks at me
They told me the Black Rhino is “endangered” so I settled.
Shouldn't that be in the mythical section?
That one got caught in the crossfire as we gunned down our ideals.
In your dreams.
With no more need for a press briefing room, it is temporarily housing the president's menagerie.
Wait 'till you see my wife!
Had to lay perfectly still in a flowery meadow for nineteen hours to make that shot.
I feel like it’s eyes are following me.
Bagged him the week before the assault weapon ban took effect!
This was my ex wife’s favorite pet.
That one is from my safari to Disney World!
Colored hearts and a beautiful rainbow filled the sky just before he shot it.
Oddly enough, there were no humpty-back camels.
I know, but it seemed like a unique opportunity at the time
Its fake news.
It was listed as a white rhino -- I was the only bidder.
The Fantasy Safari was my granddaughter's idea, but she's not at all happy with the trophy I brought back.
"I thought you said you hunted down a "wild accordion".
You get one once you reach platinum Brony status.
Yeah, I got this baby just after the ban on exotic and endangered animals was lifted.
I shot her with my thumb and finger.
Central Park. 1987. A lucky shot.
I put out a pile of corn.Uni came in and I took her at 200yds.
Yeah, I hear he had some pretty strange trips in his hippie days
They call it the 'narwhal of the land.'
Why yes, I do know exactly when the magic died.
It was the only time I felt on the horn of a dilemma.
I got the one in the middle in Silicon Valley.
This is a really weird mirror.
It's called the Unique-corn.
Yes, it looks impressive, but it's just another example of a water buffalo in a really clever disguise.
The middle one is always the problem
My daughter will never forgive me, but they seem to be everywhere here in the Bay Area.
Hell's pretty chilly now.
And this was my first mythical creature.
When your wife asked for a unicorn, this wasn’t what she had in mind...
I didn't like to do it, but Disney said they needed a live action Bambi Reboot.
All very nice, but what’s on the other side of the wall?
I shot that middle one, with the help of Donald Trump Jr.
They really are real!
I understand mounting it, but why put on a cone on the horses head?
What a shame. That would have been a great spot for an Ultra High Def TV.
Oh, I didn't shoot it. I ordered this thing at Starbucks.
we won!!!
Don, that’s one corny trophy you’ve got there
Here lies twitter, the last of its kind.
..and when I saw a double rainbow appear in the sky I knew it was a sign telling me what to do next.
I bagged that one during a dream I had one night.
Tastes like elasmotherium.
Blind shot actually. I was cleaning my gun. Never really saw it till it collapsed.
Yup, right after the election in 2016.
No more animals in the circus; and no more wooden animals on the carousel. What's next?
I saw her dancing about, prancing and skipping around like she was all that.
I fell for her when she winked at me in the garden.
They said that if I found him, he would teach me the secret of friendship. But I already had you guys. So there he is.
I actually prefer them from the feedlot. Not as gamey.
How many folks live to shoot a Steer and a Unicorn?
Oh to the contrary. Unicorns did once roam the earth. Sadly this beauty here died in a freak jousting accident last year.
She was off by herself in the gloaming.
You see during the Recession they could only afford 1 horn.
Luckily we bagged him before the poachers did .
Just couldn't stop in time--was like a piñata filled with glitter and gumdrops...
Used my daughter to bait this one in. Honestly, I'm surprised it worked.
It's said to be a symbol of chaste love and faithful marriage.
My eight year old daughter bagged it.
I think this new " mystic brew" is starting to kick in.
And I bagged this one last year on my excursion to Silicon Valley.
Which one should I use as a hood ornament?
It wasn't so fluffy
It was a magical moment.
Fox News IS real!
He wasn't on the endangered species list.
It was New Year's Eve. and I missed the pink elephant but I got the unicorn!
Fake is the big trend. Just so they can nail you to the wall!
Her other horn broke off during the scuffle.
YOU LOOK BETTER IN THE TAPESTRY
That's a window.
They think I’m dead.... I’m magical bitch!!!
When the President said he bagged a unicorn,I thought it was more fake news.
And I bagged the middle one back in '73 on a trip to the Neverlands.
I didn’t think it was possible either, but Kanye really said slavery sounded like a choice.
It's an art piece. I call it "The President's Humility"
the claims he was aiming at the yeti.
Actually, it wasn’t that difficult. A lot of bad companies attract too much VC funding.
I was hunting for a Narwhal but I bagged this thing instead
Now I have it all. First, I bagged my trophy wife and now quite possibly the last unicorn that was alive on earth. Life is grand.
It takes up much less room than our hydra trophy.
Just my luck...not a winner.
That was some trip, Boy! Donald Jr. and I were just down by the Nile and out she popped being ridden by Andy!
Well, he DID say he had a rare collection.
I shot it with My Little Winchester.
The next one I bag will have three horns.
Sure the granddaughter cried inconsolably, but doesn't it look great up there!
Confidentially, was my daughter's pony and a fake horn. Two birds, one stone.
To stand out from other trophy hunters, we decided to kill the animal that would have the most shock value.
They all look the same in the next room.
Well, I wanted to do an African Safari again, but the wife was hot to check out this place called the Magic Forest, so ...
And now she really is my little pony.
A bit corny, isn't it?
I was a virgin when I captured him.
Fortunately, the horn isn't ivory.
I, for one, recognize with the Bull." "I, myself, recognize with the Buck." "Well, I guess that leaves me as the old Queer in the middle.
Bagging the virgin was a nice bonus.
He used to visit my son, and shot him when they took him off the endangered species list.
Of course the only one my wife nabs is front and center.
Yes, Hadlee got that one with her birthday Mauser.
Not all that unique. They're rampant in Silicon Valley.
While on safari in Fantasy Land I took aim at Bigfoot when this noble creature jumped in to save him. I felt the need to commemorate him somehow.
Ugh, millennials.
My little pony is a surprise for my granddaughter.
Say all you want about ideals. I see a very horny guy with a gun.
If he was is magical why doesn't he save himself?
My daughter was not happy...
Oh, there was such a big kerfuffle over making room for it at the zoo, I thought this was best.
Yep! It sure did exist.
guns are guns are guns are guns are guns
I'll undoubtedly show up in some angry meme on Facebook, but it was worth it.
My six year old bagged that one.
I'm feeling horny.
My daughter wasn’t happy with that one.
It's the last of its kind.
A virgin captured him for me, but I had to let her go.
Took the family down to Disney, went huntin' too
The meat is considered a delicacy in Unicornia.
Perhaps we should have stopped game hunting them sooner, gents.
My granddaughter got it.
The taxidermist was also an aesthetician.
It's always been my dream to bag one of these.
You’re right, Jeff, but a rug may have created some liability issues.
I didn't know he was a unicorn with a name.
Oh. I thought you were referring to the clock.
No, no … That was my daughter, a jump rope, and a magical moment gone awry.
Sure, anyone can fuck them after you shoot them; a true huntsman fucks them -then- shoots them.
She was a real horse’s ass.
And they say that old men don't have an imagination.
So long story short, I had to attack from behind instead of head on.
Of course the children of the Mystic Forest were horrified....
The one in the middle is one horn short of reality.
You'd think the one on the right would be outlawed before the one in the middle.
In their world, our roles would be reversed.
Next month I’m going on a dragon safari.
One of you is next
Y'know, horses are a dime a dozen. But narwhals? That took some looking.
I bought it on line...
I'm not so sure it's the loveliest of all.
My wife suggested that I add a little more color to the room.
I was looking for a vibe of big game hunter but it screams piñata.
Do you think our investment strategy is too aggressive?
I had to it tried to throw me off the Carousel.
This one I accidentally hit on the way home from Burning Man.
I think this will disprove the Irish Rovers once and for all.
Well that took care of another endangered myth
Tastes like chicken.
My assistant isn’t up on Silicon Valley jargon.
It doubles as a noisemaker on New Year's Eve.
bagged her at a club in South Beach
I promised my investors a unicorn, but they still weren't happy.
And this one I bagged while on an LSD trip while confronting my id.
I didn't know you're still a virgin, Bob.
So right AFTER I shot Cecil the lion…
A Preview of What is to Come.
We listened to a lot of Kesha that year.
When I said I wanted my startup to turn into a unicorn, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
To think it was once worth a billion dollars
So Eric Trump, you just had to bag it ... didn't you.
Most people try to hide that their childhood dreams were dead, not Fred.
This one was just before they became endangered.
The Unicorn is my proudest trophy." I showed "gunlover69", who was boss on that Ebay auction!
It was my granddaughter who bagged that one.
Don’t feel bad, its not really imaginary.
They went inside the house to eat cake and blow out candles… I had to take the shot.
The genetically modified alfalfa caused the mutation, so I shot her.
Turns out that trip was all rainbows and unicorns.
The flavor is kind of a cross between snow leopard and giant panda.
Only one horn, but unbelievably tasty.
I hate to say it, but that one really clashes with the decor.
That there trophy came from The Forbidden Forest gift shop at Universal.
Cecil, the lion was already taken.
She was my daughter's.
I bagged this one at Universal Studios back-lot.
My taxidermist and I had a falling out.
Hard to believe, I know.
I must say, "when you said this will be the one!" you really meant it.
I got this one on a trip a few years back.
Hawking said they don't exist but I found a way
If I had known it was virtual hell, I'd have had virtual guilt.
I bagged that one when my granddaughter opened a box of that fairy tale breakfast cereal.
Twelve gauge shotgun. Why?
The world turned gray and darker gray that day, I'm sad to say.
That one is going to piss off some folks, bigly!
It’s pasted on
Hit-and-miss? Not me. I'll go with hit-the-myth every time.
Yes, I managed to bag the last one...
Rarely have I had a better steak.
This one I lanced from behind
What can I say? I just had to have it!
Yep, I bagged that one in Palo Alto.
Bagged that one on my trip into the rainbow bright forest.
She’s the most beautiful thing I ever killed.
The Trump boy shot it in never never land
" Of course they exist; do you think i am making this stuff up"?
...And then we went to Etsy.
"I thought it was in the spirit of Fake News, surrounded by hate and confusion. I was resigned to shooting it even though I was pretty confused myself.
They say it’s worth a billion dollars...
I bagged it at Donald Junior's game preserve in Queens.
They're good eating too!
I have always identified with the less horny variety.
Shooting that was mythical
It was standing under a rainbow. I blew its hind quarters to bits.
It speaks to the fact that not only do I believe in Unicorns, but I will kill them too.
The Critics are divided: God, Darwin or Homer!
I bagged this S.O.B in the Friendship of Equestria.
This was the last one, now they really are extinct.
It was the second to last.
Back in the day unicorns weren’t on the carousel endangered species list.
They say only a virgin can catch a unicorn. Luckily, my 13 year old daughter is a crack shot.
It came down to a choice: granddaughter or unicorn.
I got it on the black market.
‘Im told that one has a unique horn but I’ve never much cared for the thing.’
from our Lost Horizon vacation.
Tell me again about your recent vacation...
The hardest part was finding a virgin as a decoy.
When the wife said she bagged a unicorn I was overjoyed. ...And then this thing showed up.
Believe it or not, they're brothers from the same mother.
I consider myself a hunter first and a Brony second
It reminds me of kindergarten when you had to choose the one that didn't fit.
I support all animals of color.
I'm beginning to think there was something extra special in Tom's 'special punch'.
Tom did say he would get a head in style.
Africa,no Amazon.com.
Yup,... I was at a Trump rally, and it only appeared just as he began speaking...
The meat was out of this world.
It was added by Special Effects.
She's on my wall now. The rest is history.
I may have to skip the next BronyCon.
His horn follows me around the room.
Was this arranged according to ethnicity or ideology?
The bull, the deer and the unicorn walked into the bar.
"The horse got horny so I had to mount it." Adrian genetically engineered unicorns, murdered one, and learned taxidermy just to make that terrible joke.
It’s Papier-Mache, of course.
I shot him with a marshmallow gun. Good sport.
Ignore the glue on the horn. After I shot him, the horn fell off.
Yeah I had to go all the way to California's Bay Area to bag that one.
Coachella.
And I shot this on the marijuana charter tour.
Like to have never found a virgin with a pure heart as a guide.
Given the looming firearm restrictions, I felt it was important to bag the last one while there was still time!
Yes, it could have been tamed by a qualified person, but they're way harder to find.
so my understanding at the time was that it was worth a billion dollars
You’re right, it does have Trump’s hair.
It was a hard catch. It blended with the rainbow.
Can you imagine what this cartoon would look like if The New Yorker was printed in color!
Well, that is the last time we met Jim hunt on LSD.
Embrace diversity!
So I understand that the middle one's name is Ivanka
My daughter is very upset with me.
My grandson is going through beauty school.
The last one until I shot it.
Turns out my doctor said "Unisom"...
I was just so over rainbow this and rainbow that.
I shot that one back in the day.
FYI, we don’t use the ‘U’ word around here. I’ve told Meg it’s a “thin-horned rhino”.
. . . . Yes, that one was a dream shot!
Mystical? Maybe. Mythical? Perhaps. Feisty? Thirty aught six.
You know when I married Bambi everyone said she was too young for me. But I think she added a certain whimsy to my life.
I had to settle. That damn Sasquatch got away.
I bagged it in the Virgin Islands. why do you ask?
The man, the myth, the trophy.
I paid a pretend virgin with an NRA approved mythical semi-automatic to bring it down
I was hunting the unicorn but had to settle for My Little Pony.
I bagged the middle one in West Hollywood.
It was easier than you might think, I'm still a virgin.
Bagged that one at little Christina's fantasy themed 10th birthday party.
I bagged that one at FAO Schwartz
I preferred his centaur phase.
Trump says he got that one with a crossbow
Leave it to a Darwin descendant to prove it.
Let's just say the middle one took a little bit of luck...
And I always thought all cows looked the same ...
His daughter is still upset about her My Little Pony
Well, I can guarantee my daughter will have mixed emotions about this.
. . . and I got that one down on Bleecker Street.
I bagged this one on a fake safari.
Yeah, until I had the horn added, this trophy just didn’t evoke the strong, brave, courageous image that I’m going for here.
And the one in the middle was part of my granddaughter’s Halloween costume from years ago – she wanted it preserved.
She’s real and she’s fabulous.
And I bagged this one on a safari to Silicon Valley.
I did the impossible to get my little girl her birthday wish and still she isn’t happy.
Would you believe five arrows dipped in witches’ brew?
Does it looker better here or in Zoe's room?
He clearly recognized me as a good guy with a gun.
And yes, I am a virgin.
It was going to be the Uber for horses, but it went belly up after the hostile takeover.
Yeah, the last hunt was fantastic.
Internet misunderstanding; I thought I was buying into 'Uni-coin'.
Gotta hand it to those Trump boys!
We donated the meat to the native leprechauns.
I think her exact words were "Over my dead body!"
Make-believe me, he had it coming.
“Despite the Karmic debt I incurred, my granddaughter was thrilled”.
That is she, Princess Unicorn! Fictional fantasy character notwithstanding, I felt I had to bag her.
Turns out it was a costume.
And this one has rainbow colors, a pretty horn and magic sprinkles.
Tastes like chicken with a little rainbow and glitter.
This one was a little difficult. He was moving around pretty fast, but I got a clean shot at him on that crowded carousel at last year's county fair.
My heart took me to him, the gun did the rest.
Shot this one at a Halloween party just last year.
That's from the hostile takeover of a telecom start-up.
I heard the hair was Bowie's
I found her on Tinder.
It came right at me from behind the rainbow. I took it down with fairy dust.
She was the last one. I like to think I brought a lonely, childless life to a fitting conclusion.
Knowing what I know now... yeah, I suppose I do have some regret.
That was a “longshot.”
It was a safari on Fantasy Island with my daughters.
He wouldn't look so unappreciative if he knew what an honor the center spot was.
To be honest, it tasted like chicken. And the destruction of all that is magical in this world.
Toys 'r Us wasn't happy, but it really ties the room together.
Last of his kind, poor devil.
Yes, it was a shock. We didn’t realize we’d signed up for the NRA tour.
The kids at the fair were terrified, but it was worth it.
Something tells me you're stretching the truth on this one.
I call this series "Things that Looked at Me Funny."
I thought those steaks tasted funny.
You try to bag a pony on the Coney Island Merry-go-round!"
The import tax from Imagination Land isn’t as high as you’d think, but the paperwork was a mythical beast.
Like all great discoveries, I just use it to freak out my nieces
Never cared much for rainbows either.
I understand that they eat corn one kernel at a time
It was mythic
Yeah, I'm proud. So rare she might be the last of her kind.
As real as tomato bisque in the middle ages.
Coney Island, 1957.
It was a gift from Rowling herself.
I bagged him at Fantasyland unintentionally; I was aiming for the fire-breathing dragon.
Good Taxidermists are a dying breed.
I shot this beauty last spring, great little hunting spot right through my wardrobe.
Her name was Thor. She was trans.
As you will notice, the one in the center has a unique horn.
She was surprisingly easy to track.
This one I got outside a circus,but I decided to keep him anyway.
Well, yes, my daughters were very upset.
It's a travesty that people kill these beautiful animals just for their horns.
She was quoting Shakespeare. What else could I do? If I didn't pull the trigger, no one would've believed me.
I can't believe he killed 'My Little Phony'!
I’m hoping for a Black Swan on my next safari.
Huh, I always assumed he was lying about those Narnia hunting trips.
My trophy from a fake hunt
From my safari in Equestria.
Getting it home was a bit dicey; the license was for black swan.
This one i wrestled down after breakfast with Alice. Sauteed mushrooms.
It's always been a fantasy of mine to bag one of those.
The unicorn was the hardest. It was ethereal.
I call him Viagra.
Yes, very tough. Took 4 pure virgins 60 rounds to take her down.
I really wanted to pulverize it as an aphrodisiac, but Mary thought it would protect us from the plague if we left it intact.
You can’t find these anymore. They were hunted to extinction.
At first I was terrified. I thought I had shot someone's horse.
Not very realistic is it ?
The middle one is my fantasy, yours?
Yep, that was the last unicorn. And they say he's tapped to be the next Secretary of the Interior.
I wondered about a wild horse in a party hat.
We realized that it would have probably been easier to attach the horn after we shot the horse
Of all the horned creatures, this really is the one you want to have
They really do have glitter in their veins.
The little woman wanted some color.
That safari fulfilled a lifelong fantasy.
That one, I got for my daughter.
??...there were green alligators...??
It isn't endangered if isn't real. Think of it as green-hunting.
It's for my son; he didn't believe in unicorns
She sure was sweet meat!
My wife thought it would look Presidential.
Reincarnation is such a gamble
He was drinking water and got nailed by a narwhal.
But I did not shoot the deputy.
I find this kind of display too crude... leaves nothing to the imagination.
I had to lure it with a virgin
Let me know when the acid starts kicking in.
I bagged that one at Disneyland for the grand-daughter.
It was a fantastic safari.
The real unicorn here is that I’m not even a hunter
I tell ya, that was not an easy one to explain to my daughter.
I was on LSD when I bagged that one.
Now, them wuz good eatin'!
It was once my daughter's pet but turned out to just be a phase
Do you think they hear Yanny or Laurel?
It felt like a dream when I bagged this one!
We never bred her.
I know, I know, it has only one horn, but I shot it for its mane.
And they claim they are extinct!
It's been ten years since I saw my daughter for the last time.
once upon a Time, there was a unicorn in the garden.
You can call it ‘fake hunting’, but someone would say it is big and beautiful.
This one I hit with my car.
The nice thing is, only my taxidermist and I know for sure...
...and there's a beanstalk in the other room.
It's not every day you get to put a species into extinction.
I view game hunting as an effective way to manage and conserve the species.
Uncle Noah's final acquisition was entitled, "Punctuality Matters."
I wasn’t the fairest virgin, but I offered the best fringe benefits.
All three of 'em ran at the wall at a helluva speed
The monohorn recently evolved with this special camouflage to hide in certain crowds of Millenials, often found on dating sites.
It was a fairytale safari.
And return flights from North Korea are quite reasonable.
Hunting trips in Imaginationland are how they pay for conservation.
Extinct now, but was known as big dame hunting.
I got that one in California.
Surprisingly, it tasted like chicken.
Getting arrested for poaching made me swear off drugs for good. I owe a big thank you to Queen Sparkles and everyone in Lovemore Valley.
You ever get the feeling that Randolph is just a scoach full of it.
I bought this house from a millennial.
A win and a loss; my second shot just grazed the leprechaun riding it.
No one thought Trumps would get elected either
The white one looks like you, Bill.
I bagged him right next to the brass ring.
Yes, one Unicorn did exist at one time.
Thank God I had my self-loading, semi-automatic TD-95 on me.
I call bullshit on this one" (or) "I suppose you could say he's been to places most have only imagined
There taking this 'diversity' thing a bit too far.
Of course this is Hell. Do you see a cable?
And this happened before or after you married a mermaid?
Pulled up lame in the final stretch. I had no choice.
Apparently the two-horned unicorn is pure fantasy.
She was mature for eight, so I thought, "It's time"...
I got that one at Loch Ness.
I'm here to testify that Shel Silverstein was wrong. His theory is busted right here.
Isn’t 3D printing amazing?
......and the middle one was my Proctologist
Now, it's just all rainbows
My thoughts exactly Dave", sheera she to ha. Wakamanagake left hand ball bag sag felt. "Yeah, chips ARE alright." "Chips everyone!" "Anybody for uni-corn salsa and cheese dip?" "Yeah, sure, but why the unicorn reference Chaz? Fuckin jackoff.
The one in the middle my wife found in the garden.
...and I shot this one in the land of Hasbro.
I shot that one sliding down a rainbow into a pool of glitter.
I've been tempted to try out some of the modern gear, but as you can see I do pretty well with my bamboo pole and earthworms.
I bagged that one in my sleep.
I guess this is what happens to under performing unicorns....
Can’t let my Granddaughter see it!
Well, heck, I guess you weren’t exaggerating. Now show me the jackalope.
Happy accident, I was aiming for Dumbledore.
My Granddaughter nailed that one.
It seemed like a better idea at the time.
I've got a head up on the competition.
Fake hunting news.
Huh! An animal that the NRA can't shoot at since it doesn't actually exist.
You wouldn't believe the bribes I paid for a 'license' to hunt that one.
I saw it on a carousel and had to have it!
They said it in your dreams, but there it is.
Got it on a shopping mall safari.
I nabbed this one to prove a point.
Shot this one just outside of Disneyland
This unicorn keeps winning our staring contest. He’s good, very good.
The airfare to New Fantasia was astronomical, but this made it all worthwhile
It isn't really a world record but I did shoot it just in time for my daughter's birthday party.
The reality of a ‘mythical’ horn piercing my real heart won the day.
Best use for that damn vuvuzela I could find!
I call it genetic engineering and more on the way
Just a one-pointer, but still.
Now I know you won't believe this, nobody does, but I killed the most magical thing the other day...
Eventually all trends die.
And I bagged that one last year at my granddaughter's birthday party.
My former wife helped trap it.
I caught him right under a rainbow, about a foot off the ground.
The one in the middle responded to my bird calls!
POTUS appears to have a Plan 2
Of course, I bagged that one in Silicon Valley.
I bagged that one with the help of the tooth fairy.
I got this one in Silicon Valley
My daughter wasn't too happy about this one.
The guide assured me this one was genuine.
Our first-ever results for Viagra.
No, the elks’ from Kenya. This one is from the fantasy world of a 5 year old girl.
If these are specimens from his hunting days, I think we have an incidence of reincarnation.
"when he said"headhunter" I thought he was a Job consultant!.
It upsets my grandchildren so much that they overlook my mountings of actual ‘kills.’
The anthropocene has made many things seem imaginary - when in fact they are only extinct.
I was on safari in Xanadu with the Pope's wife when I bagged that unicorn.
My daughter got the same one for Christmas.
They're captured only by virgins. My fourty year old son that lives in the basement caught it.
That hunt - it was just magical!
HE WAS ALWAYS CLAIMING THAT HE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL!!
Turns out she was called Cecily.
Ok. To be honest, it's not real.
That one I bagged with a .45 caliber virgin.
I was aiming for that guy from Fox News, but I missed and hit the poor unicorn.
See? I told you they made it on the ark!
I told my daughter 100's of times "enough about a "Unicorn" living in our backyard"now go to sleep. Her persistence paid off.
They only allow one.
I know I should feel bad breaking up the last breeding pair but it was too good an opportunity pass up
Oh, that? That's just my little pony.
Regrets? well, yes - the damsel got away
You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese, humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees. Cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born, you ain't gonna see no unicorn like this because Eric and Jr. just bagged the last one...
Lisa Frank is a visionary taxidermist.
I bagged this one in Key West
Unfortunately I missed the Susquatch riding on him.
I shot him in a fiction of my imagination.
It was really a fantastic shot!
That must have been quite a trip.
The story of the hunt might sound corny, but . . . Ha, ha, ha! Get it?
I thought it would brighten up the place.
I've heard about them for years. But this is the first one I've actually seen
It was an unfortunate jousting accident.
I was 6 and the merry-go-round slowed down just enough that I got him with my new bow and arrow.
I have a vivid imagination.
It was a different kind of Disney park.
Hollywood has a lot to answer for.
She wasn't much challenge. She just stood there, smiled at me and said "Hello human grandfath"
Of course, some NGOs complained...
Actually, I think he was bi-sexual. .
Do you know how rare a one pointer is???
The taxidermist doubles as a hair stylist.
It was easy once I obtained the licensing agreement with 'My Little Ponies.'
…when I raised my rifle & fired! Naturally, the Unicorns halted. There I was…One Unicorn here, one Unicorn there… nothing but my trusty knife & my bare fist...NEVER have I been through such a Unicorn fight!
It's amazing what you can find in SkyMall these days.
Carousel hunting, again?
My daughter got that just before she vanished without a trace.
I can’t believe what you’ve done with the place.
So as my granddaughter walked ahead I followed discretely behind...
I wasn’t going to let Jeff be the only guy on our block with one.
It's true. It was a magical moment for me...
I got her right below the ribs with my 70-inch rainbow.
No, actually this is my daughter’s.
Extinct? No guilt trips please.
Yeah, I know, but poaching is an important economic contributor in mystical forests.
It was an experience like I’ve never had
I snagged this one before unicorn's were mainstream.
This is why girls shouldn't hunt.
Yeah! take us back to the great-time of Unicorn era.
I hate how I have to believe it is real.
Even without the rainbows, that last safari would still have been pure magic.
My first IPO
He knew the Gnu on the left.
great grandpa got him on a trip to wonderland
Yeah, now this one was tricky. I had to wait at the end of a rainbow for four days, camouflaged as a leprechaun...Still find pixie dust in certain unmentionable places.
….I'd really like to take a My Little Pony ....
...and, I shot this one at a school play.
Yes amigos, I AM quite the showman in our alt-life as well.
If you thought PETA was upset about the water buffalo and antelope you should of heard them when they heard about this.
And finally, my 3rd wife, Caitlyn, the last LGBT unicorn.
My wife suggested a unicorn to spicen up our sex life.
I had to give up my dentistry practice for this one, but I'd say it was worth it
The only camouflage I needed was an earnest belief in magic.
Meet our minimalist deer with single horn
And this is how they ended.
‘The way the world is going it could easily be us three on the wall instead’
We acquired this one from the Tennessee Williams estate, thanks to Laura Wingfield.
That one I bagged in the Enchanted Forest.
... and this one is from our Nambia trip.
I was also a bit bit skeptical but then “Nessie” is mounted down the hall.
From a faraway land, Toys R Us.
My 11 year old caught it in the magical forest nearby.
Guy 1: "Isn't it majestic?" Guy 2: "Isn't it exquisite?" Guy 3: "Yes, that antique clock sure is something."
one day this will be in the same category as Jurassic Park
I didn't know they allowed big game hunting in North Korea.
Next on my list is Big Foot, the Lock Ness Monster, and the Male White Rhino.
My granddaughter got the one in the middle. She was shooting for the moon.
Here is the latest in my "Crimes against Mythical Nature" trophies!

I wouldn’t hang my hat on it.
Some guys do fantasy football; I'm into fantasy hunting.
When I hear hoofbeats, I look for unicorns.
Their blood is better than Viagra...
I recycle my plastic bottles.
I shot his one on a carousel on Martha's Vineyard.
Alas, the virgin got away.
Actually, that one was in Orlando.
Not sure of the gender of the one in the middle.
Surprisingly, it was more tender than Bambi.
It's actually from a carousel but I wanted to fill in the blank space after removing my ex-wife. The way her eyes kept following me around the room was giving me the creeps.
And I shot this one on my trip to Narnia.
Yeah, bagged that one outside of the DNC headquarters a year or so ago.
Did I every tell you about my safari to Narnia?
It was her birthday.
It was delicious!
Where are we, Silicon Valley?
Sasquatch was riding her, but he got away.
I took my four-year-old grandaughter hunting with me and she really took to it.
I sent the other half to Cambridge Analytica
It’s a hot ticket for 2020.
That was a gift from Donald J. Trump, Jr., who shot it in Africa.
Our company believes in complete diversity.
No matter the number of virgins he attracted, he never lost the name "Spike".
Why's he so proud of a 1-point buck?
It promised to grant any wish I had to spare its life but I've got everything so I popped it!
Yes, we were quite fortunate to have someone with Ms. Holmes’ particular expertise in our hunting party.
You can thank me for saving him from media hounds.
Yeah, but my daughter is furious with me.
I bagged it with a photon torpedo from a gun Kirk loaned me.
Bagging that one was just magical
In your dreams.
I bagged that one at a ‘My Little Pony’ convention.
Got that one in Orlando at a theme park. Funny, when I shot it, the head popped right off. Didn't even have to take to the taxidermist, I just mounted it and here it is!
the middle one will have to do until something better comes along
Sadly enough, their love story ended badly.
It was easy once I got past the green alligators and long-necked geese.
What makes it worse is that I don’t even like it.
How bout that, Teddy Roosevelt?!
That day on the hunt--you would have thought we were transported to another world!
Of course the value’s decreased now that it’s out of the package, but it’s still rare.
The unicorn is a lighthearted attempt by Margaret to make fun of my passion.
The one in the middle makes me horny.
She was a real prick so I plugged her.
I bagged that one at the Pride Parade.
Now I hunt solely in Squatty Potty commercials.
I'll take this one over Uber and AirBNB any day.
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings ... It was just one of those things...
Harry, only in your wildest dreams you’ll catch this one!
I’ll be the first to tell you, wildlife preservation is no fairy tale.
It was on a hunting trip with leprechauns.
It scares the hell out of the grandchildren.
I bagged it in the netherworld, just as I was coming down off a three night binge.
I got the middle one when I went hunting with the white knight and the fairy princess.
Took forever to peg that one
When I was a kid I had a dream. But I fixed that.
I bagged this one last year on a trip to the magic kingdom.
I guess those "flashbacks" they warned me about when I was doing LSD in the 60s were true.
The ones on either side I bagged in Africa. The one in the center I found on Sand Hill Road, in Silicon Valley.
You've spent too much time with your kid.
Really, I killed that unicorn! But then I lost all my hair.
My quest started after Thurber piqued my interest.
My daughter is a big fan of My Little Pony.
I think this one is not as horny
If this really were hell, we'd be watching the news.
I took this one with my Unique-ARs.
Toys "R" Us had a private hunting reserve.
It was an easy kill -- she just kept going round and round in circles.
Bagging it cost a billion.
I hope you won't be offended, but - to be honest - I was always more of a Teletubbies fan
Is there such a thing as a mythical species list?
That one is from my safari on the Fairygeti.
I got that one right underneath a rainbow.
You say you don't why your daughter hasn't spoken to you since you returned from that trip to the enchanted forest?
Sophie still hasn't forgiven me.
I just had to have it.
I named this one Uber...
I've finally found a unicorn to invest in.
They say it was the last white rhino
I bagged this one at a costume party.
Not much of a rack, but I took it anyway. As far as I know, I'm the only person who has one.
You have a unicorn as a hunting trophy.
Our eyes connected, it was a wild night.
Now will you believe me when I tell you Charlie lives in a fantasy world?
Well, it’s a good thing your daughter got over her love for giraffes.
So this is what Don Jr. and Eric have been up to lately...
And that’s the reason I ended up having to marry my wife.
Personally, I don't think they're mythical.
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
All I had to do was yell at it.
Just your run-of-the-mill North Korean big game trip...
Ain’t no bull!
Are you corny, horny, or just the horn section of the philharmonic.
My grand-daughter has never liked it.
Did they say it couldn't be done... or shouldn't?
Not all virgins are totally trustworthy I guess.
He nailed it when he said, "I'm in drag."
The taxidermist suggested he dressed right.
I could hardly believe it when I shot him.
Yeah, it too a few months. But, thankfully, my little girl is speaking to me again.
Don't tell my daughtet.
My wife prefered a minotaur, but I like the single horn.
God knows how that horse got impaled by a narwhal.
My daughter thought all my children should be represented here.
Where do you think the wives have gone?
She was last seen alive at Starbucks.
I really wanted the commemorative shot glass, but I gave up drinking.
2-1-2-- Isn't that a New York City area code?
I’m going after Bigfoot next.
I got that one at a Safari in Neiman Marcus.
L train. Canarsie.
That hunt was real fantasy.
I traded a stuffed Jackalope for it.
Did you buy it on the rainbow market?
We caught the ring together.
It's kind of like a stock buyback. The remaining ones are worth more.
Him coming in second, was quite disappointing to me to say the least. Perhaps I overreacted in my hasty reaction?
They say Eric shot that one.
Bagged this one at the Lucky Charms factory.
Earlier the same day I totally had Sasquatch in my scope and bam: buck fever.
You won’t believe how we bagged that baby. It was just unreal.
I nabbed him over the rainbow
The Unicorn is from Comic Con; nuff said.
If she'd have said yes to the date . . . I might not have shot her.
You're right...it is rare.
My first one and I'm still a virgin
I first thought it was a deer using camouflage.
What if I took down the unicorn and put your mother-in-law up there instead?
I made the shot in the morning when the virgin left.
We didn't want to have six horns in the house.
And this one I bagged during my mid-life crisis.
The hardest part was tracking him.
I heard PETA had a fit about this one.
I loved the merry go round at Coney Island
The truth is they are all imaginary!
I forgot to load the camera, but I’d never forgive myself if I’d forgotten to load the rifle.
One of a kind. What a pleasure it was to bring him down.
My designer says two horns are so last year...
A favorite of mine, from our Narnian safari.
So that’s where they end up when they miss the boat.
I lost interest in hunting unicorns after putting money into Theranos
It's actually the horse I was riding. I added the horn myself.
Yup, Santa was galloping on it when he hit that huge pothole.
I totally slayed it with my #Cult45.
The grandkids were upset, but it was on my bucket list.
My daughter, Lisbeth the Virgin, bagged that one... it was her first.
A shame really that I didn't have room to hang it with the green alligator, long neck goose, humpty-back camel, or the chimpanzee.
...and good eating, too.
Didn't realize you are a virgin...
Well they swallowed the whole “clean coal” thing.....
This year, we successfully mounted an effort to increase gender expression diversity at the lodge.
All I can say is, "It was about time someone killed the whole unicorn thing."
It's not exactly saving an endangered species, but it's close.
That safari was legendary.
Of course, it's not really sustainable.
Yep, he’s the only known unicorn on earth, and I was lucky enough to bag him.
Yes... That rifle is truly magical.
I wouldn't be surprised if his next trophy was Fuzzy Wuzzy.
Me and my buddies shot that one at a centrist farm in Pennsylvania.
This trophy was once just a fairytale.
It was the Harmattan, and there I was, a brash young officer in the wilds of Ponyland.
Yeah, she's a beaut alright. Got her on a hunt in Malawi. Did you know, only the males grow horns? They use them to establish dominance in the breeding season. A truly remarkable creature, the Impala.
Yeah I got it at target in the kids section! It’s so cool and eclectic! I had to buy this child’s decor to tell people that I’m not afraid to have fun. Anyways... y’all ready to lube up and go to pound town?
The disguise didn't fool you then?
He was immortalized by Peter Beagle, you know.
I was hoping to collect more tears.
She was one-in-a-lifetime--like with my trophy ex-wife.
I bagged that one at Disneyland.
e got it for our daughter but she outgrew it.
See, I told you I bagged an antelope.
I've always wanted a pony.
I actually captured this beauty when I was six.
I got it for 10,000 Bitcoins.
The unicorn is nice, but I really wanted to bag me a centaur.
I posted that an hour ago and it already has three views.
I am surprised that my sister lets you decorate like this
It was a different world then, boys.
There's no magic to hunting unicorn.
Needless to say, the women in the family, still don’t get the sport.
So, how’s the dental practice?
Have you ever eaten unicorn? A bit sweet for my taste, but a great source of vitamin U.
And this one I bagged at BronyCon.
Gentlemen, life wasn't any rainbows like they said, so I made sure there weren't any unicorns either
I bought it on Etsy.
I guess the homeowner likes Walt Disney! He must have small kids!
" and the loveliest of them all was the unicorn " ??
This is the exact unicorn they used in that scene with Voldemort in the Harry Potter movie.
That was lala land 1973.
The death of dreams!
Coney Island, 1979!" "If that gets out,I'll know the leaker
I got it for the grandkids.
Actually, it tasted exactly like horse.
Bagged this one at a theme park.
I don't even remember shooting that one.
They used to be protected, but now they’re extinct.
Yep...I tracked the middle one in Silicon Valley.
All I remember was the rainbows...so...much...rainbows.
The Second Amendment is a beautiful thing!
Surprisingly the Unicorn was the easiest to find.
...and I call this one "Princess Rainbow Sparkle". Kinda fits, doesn't it?
Yes, they do look quite majestic even in death, but wait till you see what I've done with the butts.
It was mocking me at my granddaugter's birthday party.
Ah yes, this one is from EDC 2016.
The texidermist was drunk.
You should've seen the one that got away.
I’m a unicorn hunter for lonely wildlife.
We hunt for the benefit of the species.
This one responded to our Craigslist ad, before they took down the kinky section.
What's the deal with unicorns?
I'm horning out right now.
Someone killed Pegasus?
I believe the addition of the unicorn makes a statement as to the fraility of mankind vs. animals.
Why'd Steve put the one-pointer where the two-pointer should've been?
My wife wouldn’t let me mount the leprechaun.
no luck with that unicorn, after him I met Heather
You said “endangered” I heard “in danger.” Potato/potahto.
The narwhal got away.
Seriously, he was the one the Good Luck Club chose. Really?
yeah, but it's only valued at $900k.
I guess this helps the unicorn overpopulation problem.
I could feel the unicorn-friendship-magic-coursing-through-my-veins... then I didn't.
The tech crash was a rough time for some...
Father always wanted a girl.
I never know what to bring to Artemis' soirees.
Something looks out of place
Who's up for a game of ring toss?
I shot this one in the Serenyeti.
After I shot this one, I immediately called my little sister and apologized for calling her a liar when were kids. She then proceeded to call me a liar... Sigh!
Good thing they were just taken off the endangered species list.
Have you ever seen anything so majestic as this?
Beyoncé and Jay-Z give out a handful of licenses each year to manage their population.
My daughter was scared of the narwhal, so we dressed it up.
They all have names. I call this one Randi because she only has Ayn horn.
...and that was the last time I saw my granddaughter.
How does he explain to the grandkids that he offed "Lily the Unicorn"?
I bagged it on one of those New Age Safaris.
These participation trophies are getting out of hand.
That was 1972, my daughter's first time out.
She was a CEO who enjoyed making coffee for her male subordinates.
That one was self defense... she was going to leak our affair to the Times
In the morning haze, I was sure she was purple!
I hated to shoot it but that sword was coming right at me.
we are going to need to find a new designated driver
It's a good thing the President nullified the Endangered Species Act
This one was caught leaving a sorority house.
Yeah,,,,My granddaughter is pretty upset.
It was 1937 on Route 66 and I bagged her with my Studebaker
There's always one in every crowd.
They’re not a myth. I found him by following the trail of rainbow scat.
My truck was stained in tie dye and smelled like Starbuck for a week.
I don't brag about it. You just know the endangered species nuts would be on my case.
I hear he goes by The Dark Lord.
So , what's the point....?
PRETTY GAUDY DISPLAY FOR A ONE POINTER, DON'T YOU THINK?
It is special because it's from the original Blade Runner director's cut.
No, it's my wife's sense of humor.
She had the unfortunate distinction of being the only one of her species nailed by the Uni-bomber.
"No, I did'nt shoot this one. It was the first prize trophy at a liars convention back in the day when the difference between truthfulness and obviously preposterous lying was a form of humor.
I know they're Republicans, but this takes the cake.
That's one "Unique-horn."
Frolicking and gamboling are fine for a whimsical legend, less so for a game animal.
My granddaughter just loves unicorns... although oddly she’s not such a fan of this one
Didn’t realize my life would be cut short
Say no to CGI.
Fine, Fine. But don't blame me; no one read ME fairy tales when they tucked me in.
No! I don't feel bad at all.
It was only fair to let Bellerophon keep the wings.
Must've been one helluva a party!!
Unicorn safaris--one of the little known benefits of being a Brony.
Talk about fake news. We went to the zoo with my granddaughter, and she begged to see the unicorns.
The Trump boys shot her, then left her for dead.
Casualty of the early days of self-driving cars
And this news briefing just in from The White House: "Well, I don't know...I mean she kinda smiled at me, and I just had to have her, Ya know?"
I shot this one right out from under a ten year old girl. She was tough, only cried for a minute.
I guess Pruitt will now succeed.
I bet its fake
It was either her or my reality.
That's one miracle I bet she wished she could take back.
Of course I bagged him back before my transition, I was still a virgin...
The trophy is no big deal. It's the 208,000 followers on her Instagram beauty channel.
It was the purple glitter that made it such a tough shoot.
looks like your hunting trip to Silicon Valley went well.
I was like a unicorn in headlights
So... which one’s your wife?
Is UNICORNY a word?
My daughter is more pissed off with me than the Unicorn.
Someone killed it in 1968. Conspiracy theories abound.
The company never hit its pre-IPO valuation, but investors did get some unusual swag.
I bagged this one at Woodstock!
I had to decide between a billion dollars in valuation, or a great wall hanging.
That one was the easiest. It was in my garden.
Circled back and bagged her on the Coney Island carousel.
It was billed as 'The Tough Love Safari.' I don't know - she was never quite the same after that.
Instagram filters ruin everything these days
I just didn't like the way he looked at me.
She wondered if I listened to Pink Floyd.
And here’s an example from the hornyassic era.
I gave her time to put on her make-up.
It's my grand-daughters influence.
I bagged that one at my granddaughter's "My Little Pony' Party.
The Trump boys killed that one for me.
That's quite the fascinator.
He thought he was unique but now he's between the cow and deer on the same wall.
We were able to bring her into range by playing "Imagine." Then all it took was a few bursts from the old bump stock.
He's stuffed with rainbows & candy
It must have been curated by s white supremacist.
I out shot Erik and Donald Jr. for this beauty.
I bagged this baby on my last trip to rainbow land.
Some people were upset because it's endangered, but we donated the meat to the local elves. Plus, the proceeds of the hunt go to fighting the black magic unicorn horn market. Everybody wins.
We got that one on our last trip to Wakanda
Isn't she a beaut. The last of her species.
It actually wan't that hard to find.
My wife threatened to leave me if I shot the last unicorn but it has been worth it.
Yeah, it's a thing.
And I was with the Donald when he shot the beast...
Hmm, yes...I had thought this punch tasted a little strange......
Yes, this is the one and only Super Unicorn. Here's looking at you, Mark Zuckerberg.
I took it at the carousel in the park
We met up somewhere over the rainbow.
A mirage doesn't know if it sees you either.
You bet I’m proud. It’s a unicorn - a mythological creature. Just getting the correct hunting permit is an accomplishment.
Unique-horn, get it??
I mounted this one on more than one occasion.
I wished for a wife who would want to have a threesome, but this is still pretty cool.
I told my kid it was too dangerous for 'show & tell' at school, so the little S.O.B. took my shotgun instead!
I just imagined catching that one.
As it happens, we were out for a black swan.
How did it taste?
I can’t imagine why, but they are extinct now!
Some grind the horn into powder and believe it to be an imaginary aphrodisiac.
He always had a weakness for doe-eyed beauties. But I think he could've taken a photo instead.
No more big piles on the lawn.
We were originally hunting for bigfoot until this beauty stepped into my sights !!
The one on the lefts name is Sunshine and the one on the right is Rainbow.
Bagging that was always one of my dreams.
Thurber gave me a heads up.
The 2000 tech bubble - it was worth a shot.
Somehow he looks happier now.
It's not real. It's from his Frappucino.
I thought it was a party hat.
That's what dreams are made of.
I told you I don't discriminate.
Believe it or not...
That was the last one. You don't see them around any more.
I bagged this one in the Fairytale Forest
Bagged that beauty back in ‘69
This particular one didn't play well on Facebook at the time.
If you ask me,I say it's genetics gone haywire.
Well, my four year-old wasn't happy about it
It's OK as long as you have a permit from the Ministry of Magic.
He was the last of his kind, I'm just happy that Zinke opened up his habitat to permit me to bag him.
Liberace reincarnated?
Trump really did it this time.
I like it. It's corny, not horny.
Got it from the dollar store.
Hell in the 21st century
I made the one in the center on my 3-D printer. The image is no longer under copyright.
They'll do anything to get you to believe their truths.....
Scotland Yard was none too pleased about that one
It came with the horse.
We are in Trump Tower, The President who killed our Unicorn.
That's my last wife...hung on the wall...
I bagged this one in Sweden. Turns out the happiest nation on earth lives up to its name.
Theranos here was a nearly bloodless kill.
This one we found in the wilds of Silicon Valley.
I like how it gives the space a real masculine energy.
We'll, yeah, they were all grass eaters but that one smoked it too.
This one's worth a billion dollars.
My favorite....Spring Break 1977.
You think they're any hornier than we are?
So, she was standing at the bar drinking 'toonies with the other two when I bagged 'em.
Thanks, but I was actually hunting for Bigfoot.
It looks so great it makes me want to believe: I call it "Obamacare."
I went on this safari with the Teletubbies.
Yeah, my daughter bagged that one.
Bagged a unicorn at the magical gardens of the Washington Castle in Washington proper, he did.
My daughter bagged it at a slumber safari.
Your daughter’s gotten into trophy hunting?
The one in the middle seems very self-centered.
Unicorns? They were once considered the old middle class white men of the African plain.
Only in my wildest imagination did I ever dream of bagging that little beauty.
Now that's a unique horn!
Yep, there's always one in every crown.
Yeah, I felt pretty bad; it was my daughter's
Unicorn, party hat, or ice cream cone: It's all in the eye of the beholder.
They are not so rare anymore!
Do you think they applied too much mascara?
I used hopes, dreams, sunshine, and roses as bait. Brought 'er down with a 50 foot rainbow.
My granddaughter insisted I have her little pony mounted after it got ran over.
Hmm, so I guess legendary creature always points to the right direction.
The wife had me get that one for our Granddaughter, she's in her unicorn phase.
it only appears every 100 years
That one is clearly imported from Silicon Valley.
Antiques Roadshow said it was worth $20. It's a narwhal tusk.
„My new president trap.“
Very nice...I own property on Unicorn Island.
How about, 'No longer listed as critically endangered'?
My first kill. Back before I had kids
My tech start-up never panned out.
Did you know Jeff Bridges was in The Last Unicorn? Perhaps it's just me but I thought it was truly an underrated performance...
Besides, they're probably overpopulated.
That one was for my daughters.
"Scored this one at Michael Jackson's Neverland".
Don't let the rainbow mane fool you, it put up quite the fight.
I bagged that one back in '04 during my dream sequence.
I bagged him in the hills of Hollywood during a pre- golden age, scandal free period.
Granddaughter bagged the one in the middle. Kind of a disturbed kid.
She really was quite the little hunter before I brought that one home.
He threatened my teenage daughter
Of course this is now much less rare after ten years of low interest rates...
A prose between two horns
I shot it in Silicon Valley.
The proof is in the putting down.
It's actually paper-mache.
I don't have the guts to tell my daughter it's not real
It's purely decorative."
And which one was from your trip to the magical forest at the edge of the world?
Nah, that was my best kill; I got him cold! But I didn't shoot him. I snuck up close and froze his brain with an ice cream cone.
12 gauge. The Hallowed Scythe of Tolasis. 12 gauge.
I got that one backing out of the fairgrounds.
“We had no choice. It was simply the necessary outcome of the company’s failed IPO”.
Then one afternoon I got all Brony.
And that one I bagged in Silicon Valley
Bagging this baby finally shut the kids up about taking my car keys.
Hiking back from Woodstock that Summer of 1969, I remember saying, "I'm so hungry, I could eat a unicorn!"
Well, once the Endangered Species list stopped being circulated all bets were off.
Yes, my eyes are open. I'll see you in your dreams.
So, Noah says to me that it's either the humpty backed camel, a chimpanzee, or this lovely creature.
He’s got the magic in him...
I think that one came out of the "Lucky Charms" box.
I recall being horny most of the time.
It was a gift from Donald Trump Jr.
Really majestic creatures, Will.
I bagged that little beauty at a Rainforest Cafe in Paramus Park.
Yeah, got that one back in the 60s...
Well, it was an amicable separation, but neither of us wanted to look after her anymore.
The first billion is the hardest.
I actually ran over him with my car. Shooting him didn't seem right.
You have your fantasy football, and I have my hunting trophies.
Bad luck, shmad luck. A passion for for ring toss can be overwhelming.
Of course I did not shoot her but the President paid me $130,000 to make this problem go away.
The conservation argument doesn’t quite hold up as well here
So much for that unicorn company...
Got that one in the enchanted forest on opening day at Disneyland in 1971. I was a maiden back then.
Nice catch...the white ones with striped hair are quite rare!
The last of them, someone had to shoot them and I thought, "Why not me?".
Stanley got second place for best Halloween costume.
....and this is the famous uni-horned goat....
Those single-horned ones are twice as hard to kill as the double-horns. Go figure.
I must have walked over that hill a hundred times but never with my daughter and there it was, what a beaut-! Well, she had to grow up some time.
Boy...That antelope was hard to find...
I told you that being horny has its consequences
For that one I had to go into the deepest, darkest part of the forest.
It looks pissed off.
Even the NRA said it was toxic.
I've heard of trophy WIVES, but never a TROPHY UNICORN!
The only thing worse than Hell is this orientation video.
I added it after the birthday party, seemed like a waste of a perfectly good piñata head otherwise.
I think I like Sunday's yoga instructor more.
The tough part is resisting the urge to shoot them in the face.
Back in the '80's I used to style my hair that way
i don't care if they're extinct; i hunt them anyway
I would have thought so too, but the beef was still more tender.
Anyone carrying VIAGRA..?
I hunted once a long time ago on mescaline.
I can’t get over feeling like there’s a unicorn in the room?
I raised my rifle. She shrugged. In the end I shot her out of pity. A lonely heart I think. She clearly had lost someone. Don't call me a hero. I'm just a man with grit and the gumption to do what's right. Aw, heck, you can call me a hero.
'She's from the Magic Kingdom."
And yet I still live with my Mom.
That's the last time I'll go hunting in California.
It is to help extend our Wi-Fi signal.
I see the resemblance.
Oh look, your ex’s divorce attorney has front row seats.
I heard that they make you younger, but that's all horse talk.
Regrets? Absolutely not. The meat was quite tasty.
They say the one in the middle is worth a billion dollars, but I doubt it.
She said she wanted a stuffed unicorn.
Of course, the best part about summering Somewhere Over The Rainbow is the hunting.
Now that was a lucky shot
They said it was extinct, but I found it in the barn, poking all my horses.
It was marked as an exhibit in the divorce , then released to me after the appeal period ran out.
The horn didn't curl . but I shot it anyway.
Yup, that's Harold, to a tee. Although his horn is slightly to the left.
Yep! No one believed me when I told them I had seen one . Now I showed them!
I know you guys were upset last year when the US pulled out of the Anti Unicorn Hunting Treaty, but you gotta admit that it’s pretty neat.
I shot this one at Sherman College. It just pranced onto the field at halftime.
I shot it while on LSD.
I told Customs it's a fancy rhinoceros.
What an idiot, I asked for a Rhino, and he brought me an unicorn.
We fed our army of Goblins with the rest of the body.
I’m a level 10 airbnb host.
He was the last male.
Dick Cheney Memoirs: Nobody believed me I was actually aiming at this thing when that imbecile Harry Whittington got in the way.
It looks so real.
Couldn't bring myself to shoot the rainbow.
Well boys, that middle one was quite a rascal. I bagged him in Fairyland before he tried to sprinkle me with pixie dust.
I was able to nail this guy in Wakanda with a vibrainium-powered, sound-based weapon.
Even though they’re extinct I was still able to get one.
It’s my first wife, Shirley. I’ve done all I can for her.
My little girl shot that one. Chip off the old block, I'd say. ; )
One horn or two, it's just twisted to proudly display a dead animal's head.
Gnu? Gno.
Incredible Jim. How do you keep the mane so luxurious?
The trick? Narwhal
It probably went extinct because it was less horny than the others.
Yeah, my father was a hunter. And a big dreamer. Did I mention he was also a sleep-walker?
It appeared after reading Michael Pollan’s new book!
I have always been fascinated by the beautiful eyelashes.
I would really like to know where she gets her hair done.
My granddaughter wasn't too happy about that one.
Some girl named Phoebe is threatening to sue me
So, you still don't believe in unicorns?
I figured I better kill it just to be safe.
This I got by accident, I was actually hunting the elusive Zebracorn.
The middle one was half price
Amazing what they can do nowadays with cloning-now we can shoot all our favorite imaginary animals
He was screwed after losing 10 races.
"Boy he must have been running very fast to get his head through the wall".
Word on the street is that it's not real.
I am still not convinced.
It's got that je ne sais quoi
Unicorn, schmoonicorn, two is better than one.
The hunt was fantastic.
I had to change it - I was getting too much flak about the Bambi.
I can’t believe he paid a billion dollars for this.
It’s a new species - an LGBTQA. What’s the A for, you ask? Good question. The A is for Albino.
Now reason tells me that it was ego, penetrating my dreams- all along.
I got the one in the middle hunting with Pliny the Elder.
Liberals..
Yeah..., good friend is a pioneer in the field of cosmetic taxidermy.
And now that they're extinct, the price is going to skyrocket.
On a comfortable queen-sized mattress. Why do you ask?
Got that one was after my first Boston Marathon.

And I thought Trump killed all the magic.
He said he collected rare animals.
And here’s the *actual* last unicorn.
It was the merry go round from hell.
Shot that one just south of San Francisco, right outside the Googleplex.
I call her, 'American Dream.'
My granddaughters haven't accepted my latest trophy.
My financial adviser values it at over a billion dollars.
I think they just glued a horn onto a Pegasus.
Her stylist shot her because she was such a diva.
To each his own.
Right to the end it appeared to believe it really was special, and that I wouldn't go through with it. It was then that I delivered the coup de grace.
Apparently, not what my investment advisor meant, I later learned.
It's a finger substitute.
Who is the lucky one now?
I got that one in Equestria. Now my children don't speak to me.
I was fined for shooting that one. It's the national animal of Scotland.

But how does it taste?
I heard that if your heart is pure, it can answer any question in the universe.
Had to buy a special tag for this one.
My 9 year old daughter can’t forgive me for this one .
We've really reached an all-time low, huh?
They're known by the horns they beep.
When I die, I’d like my head to look as fabulous as that one in the middle.
You think this is disgusting? You should see the mess on the other side of the wall.
Oh they require a permit now.
It's real and it is spectacular!
Poor saps, it's high school all over again.
By the way, I'm still a virgin.
...and he still didn’t get a “wow!” What does Eric have to do to get a good tweet?
I have only one word to describe it, magical!
We all know Charlene loved her unicorn collection, but even I never expected this request for her final resting place in her will.
Anne wasn't kidding about this "Brieing" stuff
Don't worry—I got that one before they were endangered.
I was lucky to have a good fairy guiding me.
Didn’t peg RuPaul for a sportsman.
THAT one nearly wiped me out.
I just had to believe.
Stormy was wearing a strap-on.
Brought that one back from Silicon Valley.
It was my granddaughter's favorite, she hasn't spoke to me since.
Dammit. I owe Nancy a dime, with interest.
Bagged this one in my own private Shangri La.
So this is what they meant by investing in unicorns
We decided for alternative therapy, and after a deep journey into her unconscious, I managed to hunt her tormentor.
Got two of them on a safari trip - the unicorn on an acid trip.
Trust me, that's the point.
I still liked it better when the TV was here
There’s one in every family.
I saw another one but it was just too fast.
That's my last unicorn mounted on the wall, looking as if she were alive...She smiled, no doubt, whene'er I passed her but who passed without much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands; Then all smiles stopped together.
This is the only one that grants wishes.
You won't see one of these every day!
Last year's LSD trip.

Yep, Grand Prize, Fantasy Hunting!
I bagged that one at Wal-Mart.
Never play leapfrog with a unicorn
So... you see the game last night?
We captured that one in Disney’s Magic Kingdom.
I'll take the candles.
I suspect the evolutionary tree will need a new 'mythological' branch.
When I bagged, it still had a $9 billion valuation
I was going to let it go, but I'd be damn if some other dentist got instead me.
I say, `Uncommonly horny.'
Could this be a reflection?
It was truly a fairytale safari
I bagged that one back in the '60s.
Will those Trump boys stop at nothing?
“Second verse same as the first”.
Just doing my part for conservation.

Mythical creature or not, if it has horns--or A horn--I shoot it!
People still question if it’s real.
If you think this is great, you should see the other room!
Okay, it came from a ferris wheel, but I just had to have it.
It's an interesting conception, but voice by Alexa goes a little far
Actually, I thought the breed had died out.
An animal's eyes have the power to speak a great language. ~Martin Buber
I got that one when I was in dental school.
I didn't know you were allowed to hunt at Fairy Tale World.
It was either prove they poop rainbows with a picture, or bag the trophy.
IT WAS A MAGICAL HUNT
I've been at this a long time.
-I’ve been meaning to tell you guys about this wardrobe I found in the attic. -Oh my God, Jim! What have you done?
This one may be even more unbelievable . . .
It's a space holder for a dragon's head.
Can you guess which one isn't real?
It was a Lifetime Channel Club safari.
I knew I saw it somewhere
Surprisingly, I took him in my daughter's room.
He didn't believe that I would shoot.
Little Suzie wasn't too happy with this one here - but to our credit, we stayed clear of the rainbow....
How? Unique up on it...
wHEN ALIVE, SHE ALWAYS LIKED WEARING THAT PAPER HORN!
...AND....can you believe it....I got the last one!
I think the unicorn is the loveliest of all.
With the legalization of marijuana on the rise, they are no longer a protected species.
The one in the middle I shot in my garden.
I wonder why he looks so unhappy.
I bagged that one at Starbucks just a year ago
I told you the gays were marginalized!
We call it "a dilemma of horns".
While we all shot in rapid succession, the necropsy proved my bullet felled the beast..confirming, as I thought, that it was My Little Pony...
The make up artist at Sephora really did wonders for her. So did the Dry Bar stylists.
Your trophies look authentic, but I'm thinking mine is a fake.
I bagged that one after reading Michael Pollan's latest book.
We keep looking for a matching set for our collection but rainbows seem to be in short supply these days.
I don't get it -- my son says he's a unicorn.
As you can see, gender and racial profiling dates back to mythological times
The horn continues to grow. Magic.
I have a rare Jackallope in the back room...
It was one of those perfect hunting mornings, rainbow and all.
One thing about those fairy tale nights? Clean sight lines.
They're so much harder to get now that the poaching laws have gone into effect.
From then on, they held the Cosplay Convention in a less remote venue.
I's a horn trio by Saint-Saens

Ralph and I bagged the very last horned My Little Pony at Toys R Us liquidation sale on the plains of Staten Island.
horny hunting!?
I took that one on safari at a local amusement park.
Yes, I got the middle one off the merry-go-round while hunting in Torquemada and Diez Coronas.
Of course he's angry. I shot him just before he got to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
The man who shot it was a complete fantasist.
Your collection is out of this world.
This one was hiding in my daughter's toy chest.
Yea, Al, I have fond memories of bagging that Unicorn a long time ago when the earth was green.
Funny how the Bears Ears gas leases were more improbable.
It's one of a kind
This one wasn’t very hard to hunt. Maybe it’s because it only has one antler?
Of course I was only twelve when I bagged this one --- before Elly in grade seven.
Word on the street is that Human Resources nabbed that one.
I feel like the unicorn is either a Carrie or a Samantha... the antelope is definitely a Miranda.
I dont know if its the booze or the mounts--but im gettting very HORNY
Luckily, I bagged the last one.
I sure hope they don't think we're horning in on their party.
A fantasy forest special.
More than ever, I want to be a taxidermist.
This IS hell. Terrible TV cable programming for eternity
You think you're done for, then instinct takes over.
You're not going to believe how I bagged this one.
Say, Archie, shall we file a suit for reverse discrimination?
There is nothing funny about trophy hunting.
No, I don't think I'm part of the cause for extinction!
The rest of the body is on the wall in the dinning room.
Real clarity about his vision of the future.
No, I don’t have an elaborate hunting story for this one either, had an easy shot and took it.
I bagged that one on a carousel in Botswana.
I like killing animals, as you can see.
Don Jr.'s girls quit talking to him right after this safari.
My granddaughter disowned me after I bagged the middle one.
It tried to evade us with pixie dust and magic rainbows, but eventually we tracked it down and put a slug square into its fantasy heart. I'll never forget the sweet feeling of accomplishment.
My wife tells me I'm having a legendary mid-life crisis.
I bagged this one for my five year old granddaughter.
I shot it while vacationing in the Poconos.
The stable's right behind. We can feed 'em directly without even leaving the living room this way.
No big deal. A horn is a horn.
I can't imagine how Hunter S. Thompson got this trophy.
I see you have one female in the group.
Got that one in Maine..haha..get it....mane..haha
It reminds me of my own vulnerability.
The middle one was much easier to mount ... I just needed a saw.
Don Junior bagged that one just North of San Francisco
I got the middle one when I was 9.
Maybe we've taken this diversity thing a bit too far.
Hmm, I thought Unicorns were on the endangered species list..?
It was the only one left, and it's MINE!
My daughter became a vegetarian. This is her way of critiquing my lifestyle choices.
Yup, it was hard to tell from a thousand feet.
"I got the the stag on the left at a party, the unicorn from Coney Island, and the steer from Old McDonalds Fram.
I shot it at the Cloisters
You won't believe where I was when I came upon him!
The center one is from Medieval times dinner theatre.
It had 2 horns, but one was broken.
He was looking for love.
It's from my Palo Alto safari
I hear it's got cotton candy stuffing.
It brings out my feminine side.
It's not real implicit bias for me to like the white one best--it's not a real creature!
Don’t knock it til you try it.
You should have seen the gryphon that got away!
This will show the bronies
Theo bragged he had it all but the magic was gone and he never understood why....
I bagged it on a safari in my little ponyland.
Being Irish, he had an abiding sense of tragedy, which sustained him through temporary periods of joy.
...and this is the first myth's.
...and this one I got during a trip to Silicon Valley.
My wife actually did this one, something about the eyelashes.
And that's when I realized that I was at a Furry convention.
I had to travel through time for the beauty in the middle.
Next year we're going after jackelope in Wyoming.
They shot him at his own birthday party.
You're right. It didn't give a f*ck what kind of trousers I was wearing.
My centaur neighbor borrows that one every April 1st.
I feel really sorry about this one, I mistook him for a Trumpicorn.
That one's for my $1 billion polyamorous frappuccino.
HAS THERE BEEN ANY WORDS YET FROM THE FOLKS IN THE APARTMENT BEHIND US ?
I had more of a problem with the leprechaun-skin rug.
Well, Mr. Fudd, I guess I would also have given up on rabbits and ducks by now.
Quite the congenital abnormality on this hippo!
She almost had me.
Don't tell my daughtet.
For a horse she sure has a unique horn...
I got this one in Disney World.
So, you say you caught it yourself Keith? Aren't they supposed to only appear to virgins?
The rest of it we made into unicornbread.
Of course, it's missing an antler...
Bob hit it dropping his son off at the Bronie Convention.
It was on display in a British pub; I bought it on the spot.
Would you believe she was a road kill when I discovered her
Maybe it would do better in the corner beside Nessie and the yeti.
...and to avoid any criticism, I followed the food ethics rules and eaten the entire body.
They're easy to track by their spoor, which is also delicious.
MAGIC KINGDOM
So, you don’t feel any guilt about killing the last living Unicorn?
This time Donald Jr. went to far.
It's astounding. I mean, how did a narwhal manage to ram a horse from behind?
But I fully comply with CITES
Like spicy chicken.
The narwhal tooth was the expensive part
Bagged her in the Enchanted Forest
Astonishing--only the rarest unicorn leans center-right.
You won't believe where I found that one.
It's made out of recycled plastic
And. that's why I legalized hunting of all animals, because I knew my son Donald Jr. could bag a Unicorn
I think she said, "Don't Shoot." But I couldn't be sure.
I looked a gift horse in the mouth and he's what I got.
Hunting that unicorn was mythical.
Wait until you see them sing.
One would think it's on the endangered species list
Well, SO, it's a party hat.
Looks like it was a hell of a party.
This one was captured by my daughter, early in our hunting trip when she was still a virgin.
The lion seemed kind of mundane.
I understand that I made a mistake, but can’t joint custody be an option?
Yep, I guess you'll never know what it feels like to bag one of these.
This one's extinct now.
I can see a few plastic surgeries have been performed.
He seemed a little ‘other wordly’ at dinner.
She’s not impressed by her place on the mantle.
I bet that’s a wig and candy.
They amended gun laws to include mythical beasts.
My vegetable garden is doing better than ever
Did you know Chuck Norris coined the phrase, "I could eat a Horse" after he ate every last unicorn in existence.
Well, well, well, what have we here? That's a nice deer head ya got.
I have a funny story about that buffalo...
One of a kind!
I told her I was a virgin.
I think I might’ve passed on it, but I had this dang space in the middle that I had to fill with something.
Fake Trophy...
Maybe it’s a sign we should invest in taxidermy.
It was just a horse but that taxidermist made it special.
I thought we incels could use a horny mascot tamed by virgins.
Was he recently mounted?
Oh, it's worse than that. We were married.
Mermaids are the next frontier.
Fantasy Hunting Camp summer '16, I used my virtual rainbow as bait
Of course, I was a virgin when I got that one.
Aye laddies, I'm still fighting for the crown.
Looks like Voldemort finally found his feminist side
So, my daughter is in cosmology school and got pissed when I wouldn't let her dye MY hair.
Let's put it this way, my ex loved those bloody things.
Best spear throw of my life.
I think the middle one likes me!
Yup, she is what's for dinner. Hope you can get beyond the pink and purple meat that smells of wildflowers.
My granddaughter is going to love this!
It's a fake... They really are a myth. Makes for good conversation.
I’m waiting for Wall Street to drop another so I can have a matching pair.
It was a little gamey.
Anybody else feeling horny?
I bagged that one in my granddaughter's bedroom.
That one bolted from the pride parade, but luckily I had my rifle in the Range Rover.
My Safari trackers were Oompah Loompahs.
It's really no big deal if you've got an eye for it
Take it from me, fellas— if you give your daughter a pony and she’s going to want a unicorn safari.
Yeth, I wath very lucky with that one - I clothed my eyeth and bang! It was hit or myth.
And that one I shot in our garden some months ago.
The whole "I want a pony" phase came to an abrupt end the day I put it up.
Trophy hunting for human recreation, no wonder they're extinct!
I couldn't believe it was real, either; until I mounted it on the wall with the others.
One day he just crashed through the house so I started to feed him. He doesn't plan on leaving now or ever by the look of things.
Not in my wildest imagination did I think I'd ever see one, let alone bag one.
My wife used to think I was a creep. Now she just thinks I’m cruel.
I told her we should go online unicorn-hunting to keep things interesting and she bought this on eBay.
This is the taxidermist's signature look.
Eh, I have three
Of course, accessories and a little eye makeup, go a long way.
She was killed by friendly fire; another unicorn with a different agenda.
Who says life isn't all unicorns and rainbows?
I bagged the unicorn in Silicon Valley.
I lured it in range using my 5 year old granddaughter. Wouldn't have been possible until this administration. 219 on the Boone and Crockett.
Yes, it’s my greatest achievement. I made it myself.
This one I bagged pre-IPO.
So… which is the ibex?
It was a dream hunt.
I have a good ideal who might have spiked our punch.
Thats Cold
Can’t be accused of single hornism.
And I'd always thought they were male.
It cost me a fortune to pay the virgin who found him!
Chip and Joanna did the house. Their kids did the decorating.
Meh,... Unicorns, you see one you've seen them all
Let’s crop the black guy out in the email, OK?
His Mother and Father never opened their eyes to his orientation.
The hair was right but he just wasn't horny enough."
That one I got with your standard finger gun.
This one was uh... a gift from the Fairy Godfather.
Yeah, I was a little surprised I got a hunting license for that one. Guess they needed to thin out the herd.
must be an immigrant
I used it as a bookmarker while reading Portnoy's Complaint.
...and now Elly's gone to live with her mother.
The taxidermist said it would be quite a conversation piece.
Face to face.
The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
Who knew my hunting license wasn't valid?
My granddaughter got 20 to life for poaching that one.
I'm not saying I was a virgin at the time, and I'm not saying I wasn't. Let's just focus on the results, OK?
I still can't believe that he was the one who nailed her.
Didn’t take any magic to get him!
I was this or the fountain of youth.
Now that's the Uni-cornupoia of trophies.
This one is from Fantasy Park in Candyland...
The bullet hit an artery and she spouted the most beautiful rainbow.
That one? I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
I acquired this one because it was going to disrupt magical thinking.
She’s from Carousel.
Anything to keep the Grandkids happy.
Now I believe, I'm ready for an adult relationship.
My daughter always loved My Little Pony
Actually, Greg, the only thing mythical about them is that they AREN'T overpopulated in Fairyland.
My Granddaughter nailed that one.
I just had to have my very own Little Pony.
I bagged it right after the Initial Public Offcring
I bagged that one in the Hollywood hills.
I didn't kill him. He got his horn stuck in an elevator door.
I bought it in a Jackalope store out West.
He winked at me!
It was a dream hunting trip--on my bucket list for years.
It's actually a gay rhinoceros.
She was my very first Pet.
That? Bagged in Animeland. Single shot, panorama, 35 mm.
Easy enough. I set out a Squatty Potty as bait.
Maybe I was wrong about one horn missing...
For God's sake, don't tell the EPA!
Naw, Unicorn horns aren’t woth that much in the market
It was an easy shot. I had trapped it with some jelly beans.
And that’s an extension I received from my taxman.
"These tight pants are clouding my judgement".
The last unicorn...shot it right after it pierced the tech bubble back in ‘18 - too late.
Guess friendship wasn’t magic after all.
Who does your eyelash extensions?
Coney Island. '59. Thirty-ought-six.
It supports conservation and ensures their ongoing success, you know.
It was so beautiful, I had to gun it down.
I can see why you have to be at least 13 for this contest
Who knew he hated "My Little Pony" so much
“Just as he came around to ‘spear’ the ring, I bagged him!
So I actually had a fire breathing dragon in my sights when this unicorn darted out in front..
No, I didn't kill this one. You see, when Unicorns say, "lashes to die for," they always follow through.
Did we pay the Comcast bill for this month?
No, you idiot, Rainbow Dash is not a unicorn! This is more likely Princess Celestia.
What happened to the other horn?
Follow me to the living room and I’ll show you the slayed dragon.
Okay, so Trump exaggerates a little,,,
I bagged him the Summer of '68.
And that's where we are all headed, unless we get our clothes back on.
And that's why they call him "The Dream Catcher."
He was equal with Don, Jr., so had to one up him.
Bagged him at a New Year's eve party
I was on acid at the time.
Now we can pet them all the time.
My daughter wanted to decorate too.
I was a children's book author.
Still don't get where he found this.
No endangered species nonsense with that one.
Hey, bronies like to hunt, too.
…an absolutely fearless beast and my most prized kill: shooting at green alligators, long necked geese, humpty back camels and some chimpanzees –she stood in my line of fire.
This brute was actually full of glitter!
Not to worry. He's not an endangered species.
You know you need a virgin to catch one of these? I spent a week neck deep in 4Chan for this trophy.
Ah, there’s the last unicorn.
I guess she's a virgin after all.
Finished, Yes--but never actually placed.
All you need is a high-powered rifle and the dream doesn't die that hard.
Obviously old boy, the high maintenance habits of the Barbie unicorn presented a considerably higher financial encumbrance during the sport of bagging the beast.
Thank God I don't have any granddaughters
It’s my collection of nonexistent species that really wows people.
I know it's only make believe but so are the stories of how I bravely hunted down the others.
My granddaughter was REALLY hacked off about that one!
It really was a fantastic Safari
Whatever Lola wants...Lola gets.
That one drown herself. I placed a mirror on the bottom of my pool.
Narwhals are cooler.
Looks like my mother-in-law.
That’s when I was still working for the Antitrust Division.
I bought that one from the Theranos whistleblower.
I expected it to have more colors?
I must say, my taxidermist was most impressed with this catch.
And next I'll show you my collection of trolls and fairies
The NRA awarded him that after he shot the child on top.
Why don’t you go back to your My Little Pony friends
I bagged that one in a dark corner of Silicon Valley.
Do you think the one in the middle was transgender?
I caught him when he stumbled over all the crap coming out of Washington.
It was the last one on Earth. You know Timmy, I just love exercising my Second Amendment rights.
Lily, my second grader, bagged that one.
And your point is...?
The unicorn surprises everyone.
When little Annie was 14 she put her My Little Pony on steroids and it shortened its life span and this is sort of a memorial how it looked near the end.
If it were magic, how could I have shot it?
Ugh! I think they should draw the line at Rainbow Dash.
You'd never believe how much it weighed field dressed.
If it's not real, it's fake news, right?
No, I said I shot it in Maine.
Hmm. Headhuntershave been staulking us roo
The last unicorn. Next to Rudolf and Ferdinand. Why don’t unicorns get names?
I’ve got three on my wall and they still haven’t turned a profit.
Ernest Hemingway never hunted a unicorn in his life.
This one was wondering near Kleiner Perkins office.
Once we mounted the unicorn head, the dragon does not seem to want to play with us anymore.
I bagged him on a merry-go-round in Zimbabwe.
I slayed that one on the NY Stock Exchange.
The meat was a little tough.
They say he was only two years old when he slew the Minotaur!
No, I did't shoot that one myself. I got it at a flea market.
About twenty minutes before I shot him, I gave him two viagra.
It bled in rainbow.
Oh, its one of the normals.
My 8-year-old granddaughter thought we needed to brighten up the trophy wall.
Um, yes, it's from my fabulous LSD trip in 1983 - making me what I am today.
One of these things is not like the others One of these things just doesn't belong . . .
Do you think it’s a white supremacy thing?
I had to travel to Silicon Valley to bag that one.
How she came my way is a wonky story, but she sure is showy.
No daughters, you say?
Would you liked on hear the accompanying fantasy I was having ?
Stay still, maybe they won't notice us
That one's the wife's.
I have always found big game hunting somewhat magical!
Yes, quite elusive I had to wait almost an hour to get this one. But get a guide to help you find them.
My wife couldn’t stand the competition.
Wife thought this wall needed a little color.
Endangered? Maybe. Extinct? No.
As beautiful as the head of this exotic equine species may be, you can imagine how beautiful it is at the withers.
Winning this beast was a magical moment.
That's what I do. Fake it until I make it.
What are you doing after the orientation?
Last week my wife got me a new shampoo.
I still think fakes encourage recreational hunting.
I made him an offer he couldn't refuse!
That one was hunted and shot by Eric and Don Jr. at one of their Dad's golf courses.
I didn't know Disneyland Paris permitted hunting.
The guy was so horny he even mounted his fantasy.
Reminds me of that polo pony that lost you the cup last year.
But sure as you’re born, the loveliest of all is the unicorn
What an asshole.
I guess this means no more rainbow lattes.
A unicorn showing a stink eye--now that's scary!
My granddaughter gave me the idea for this one.
It's a rare specimen of horse.
The meat tastes like peppermint patty.
I've officially endangered unicorns, so obviously it's now the moral responsibility of every backward brown people country in the world to stop hunting them for sustenance.
The irony is this fella was trying to pierce my heart because I was telling tales of his existence.
Corny.
My Little Pony died last week.
I call her La Gioconda.
I was on safari with Walt Disney.
I nabbed this one in a dream.
Jesus, not another gay activist.
We need to tell him his fantasy gaming is getting out of control.
I invested $83M and all I got was this stuffed head
I brought this one from Disneyland.
I don't believe you.
Let's just say it was a difficult mount.
the meat was magic while the horn, may help with the Arthritis ?
The unicorn is a fake. Everything at the resort is a lie or a fake.
I don’t get the point of all this.
A little rich, I say. George hasn't earned his third comma yet.
Talked that one to death!
That's almost as impressive as my collection of magical unicorn poop.
Trump and the NRA will be blamed for this somehow
I loved her best but she cheated on me with a centaur.
Yeah... once a brony, always a brony...
Wow, you poached the 1%
Now that we found a unicorn we have our threesome.
Just keeping it real.
Disneyland 1982.
The one in fancy dress put a hell of a fight.
At first I thought it was a rhinoceros.....
It’s not as sharp as it looks
Elon Musk says it's the latest thing from Mars.
I'm telling you, singing candlesticks are the toughest prey you'll ever meet.
Boys, it was either him or me. Or my granddaughter’s everlasting happiness.
They claimed it was the largest military parade - ever!
Just by sheer luck, I came across this one magically.
My granddaughter always wanted a unicorn.
Fake.
No bull, it was a once-in-a-lifetime hunt.
Next trophy will be the last Democratically elected President.
And this one I bagged just as he rounded the turn at the kentucky derby
I bagged this one in Palo Alto, just after it completed a B-Round financing.
I think this will really go with the unicorn theme in my daughter's room.
When I brought it back, my daughter said she wanted an alive unicorn.
The Agency did say they put the sparkle into Headhunting
In my defense I should note that there were still two Unicorns after I bagged this one. There is no way I could have known they were both males.
So much for beliefs
How Fast Do YouThink They Were Running When They Hit That Wall?
Hunted in Disney world, it was wide open...
That's the one that's going to get me reelected.
Looks like the middle one got the girl.
Scored this beauty on the Harry Potter safari.
Didn't have to leave the back yard.
I guess now we have to idolize the rich and beautiful.
Well, initially I thought it was just a vain horse.
The myth, however, got away.
Aren’t they endangered at this point.
It really is The Everything Store.
He came straight from Marci Gras!
Bagged it before the dot com bubble burst.
Bob, look, it's you!
In my own defense, they're over populating the region.
That’s the skinniest Rhino I’ve ever seen.
If you hang a picture on my horn, I will skewer you.
I was microdosing and figured it must have been an elk.
There's something I've been needing to tell you, fellas.
She was brought down at 400 yards during a Halloween expedition.
KEEP CALM  and OMG! I killed a unicorn.
Silicon Valley used to be crawling with those, before the big venture capitalist safaris moved in.
It just hit me.
They said it could not be found but we found it.
I bagged a great white too, but I'm gonna need a bigger wall.
I bagged that one right after the government said that having too many of them was a danger to our economy.
I got this one in Silicon Valley
Yep, he's still pissed off at me.
I combined my swordfish and my horse. My granddaughter says unicorns are on trend.
Look, I don't mind drinking the blood, but staring at its eyes, too?
My rebellious sister`s addition that put an end to the killing of wonder and innocence through a long standing family tradition of incest.
But how’s it taste?
Now that's one exotic centerpiece.
Even the necrophiliac subset of the Brony club thought it was a bit vulgar
My broker is EF Hutton, and he says...
Looks like, Unicorn was hanged alive.
Donald's hair.
If you say 'James Beard' he gives you a recipe.
You are the horniest guy I know!
Don’t worry Stan, I had all the proper permits.
But the wig isn't orange! Can't be a POTUS
By the way, Fred, how's Bayeaux?
Yeah, microdosing is for wimps.
They all learned they were out of a job via tweets. Even Karma, here.
It is supposedly rare, but I never saw any others.
Can I borrow some cocaine?
Kinda brings a whole new vibe to this room, you know?
I got carried away on that one and shot my grandson's ferrous wheel phony ride.
This estate sale is a little corny.
It was once tethered to a pomegranate tree, surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers.
I knew the minute I saw the Unicorn that my daughter was going to disinherit me if I brought the trophy home.
I found that one in a book my granddaughter loves.
Got that one during a late night Dream Hunt!
I guess it was ok, Ryan Zinke shrugged when I asked
She wanted me to be more gender-neutral.
Came across that one on my last trip to England. Suddenly, this school girl with a gyroscope around her neck appeared. The next thing I knew, it was early 2001, and I was at my broker's selling all my Enron and buying Amazon and Apple.
Bagged this beauty pre-IPO post early-stage on University Ave in Palo Alto.
It must have been poached.
Kind of garish don't you think?
She was at a party and I couldn't resist her.
Got this at the annual cull in California.
And that's why I killed it and had it mounted. You really need to see it with your own eyes to believe it, don't you?
Of course I bagged that before I met your mother.
Quite rare; we had the Irish Rovers as guides.
It was illegal, but The Donald got it changed so that I could get one. It's a fake horn. That was worth $1 million alone on the Asian market.
I bagged this baby when I was 26
I got him on sale
She's always horning in.
Some are born leaders. In the case of Elsa, the herd mandated it.
I always wondered if Jim's trophies were legit, but this seals the deal.
Yes, this is the fabled unicorn!
I'm just using it to hold that space until I can bag a Bengal Tiger.
We went after he relaxed the rules on extreme hunting in Alaska.
The center one is quite unique.
A single paleface. Now that's new.
We had to lure that one out of the reserve with a gummy bear carcass.
Of course, my grand daughters, daughters, and wife had some comments on it.
It was simply legendary.
They're not quite unique
Oh my! There WAS a unicorn in that garden!
Excessive? Sure, but you wouldn't believe what I to overcompensate for.
And here is the Brony I bagged at the local comics convention.
It has been passed down from generation to generation, to generation ...
Apparently it was a jousting contest that went a bit wrong.
Thank Goodness my Wife is still a virgin...
A party animal alright . . too bad she thought she could horn in . . . like a regular human being . . .
I didn't know you and Sandra were into that sort of thing, Phil.
I culled it for the health of the herd. Unfortunately it was the last of the species.
This one was the easiest to conger up.
I was aiming for that Voldemort fella, but this is nice too,
If I saw one more "Squatty Potty" ad on Facebook, I was going to have to shoot myself.
Missed the virgin...though.
And, with this one, I'm proud to begin my PC approach to hunting.
They all seem to be from different tribes!
Since I already have the humpty back camel trophy I couldn’t pass it up.
That hunt... it was such a dream
Wow, I never saw myself as a unicorn!
.... and then she said. That’s the one I want!
Good shot? You're kidding. The other heads are 2 game wardens, 7 hunters and a cow.
I pulled her head off at the carnival, leaving unharmed the two guys making up her body.
Honestly? I thought the first graders would be into it.
I was lucky, I got the very last one.
It was a dream of mine.
It’s points to the gender neutral bathroom.
It’s points to the gender neutral bathroom.
I call this one: "The Great President."
Of course, I got this one in the mono days, before they started coming with the modern stereo horns.
"I had to bribe a pixie for this.''
Whoa! I've always wondered what happened to Jim's ex.
I had to use an arrow soaked with my special herbs for him. The hunting rifle was useless!
The hunt was long and hard. It was on the 9th day when I finally ran her down. Then the Bronies came out ...
I've forgotten what I was on, but it was really good stuff.
People think they're endangered, but they're not.
My daughter shot this one.
You see! There /are/ NRA supporters with a pure heart!
I never knew albino rhinos had such long eyelashes.
Disney keeps pestering me to sell the copyright.
A calculated attempt to bring out the worst in people
... and I bagged THAT one on my last trip to Silicon Valley.
The hunt of the old, white male. The evaluation of our souls.
Ah, what the hell boys, I say we still tell our upstate fishing stories.
"My VC buddies bought it as a joke, they call me the unicorn hunter".
Even I can't believe my 28-year-old daughter bagged that one.
This is a strange urinal
As you can see, I nailed this one right between the eyes.
I didn’t neen to shoot it, just threaten to shoot the Coney Island carousel operators.
with her evil eye ... she somehow knows all my secrets.
If only she'd told me sooner that she was the last female on earth...
All I need is "My Little Pony" to complete the set.
The middle one was rather hard to bag since it’s only found in mythological surroundings.
It looks so real.
I only bagged that one to annoy my liberal wife.
You know, I've been waiting for just the right opportunity to work the word "asinine" into a conversation!
This place is very magical
Cupid shot that one.
It was close enough to stab, but my AR-15 was handier.
The owner has a corny sense of humor.
They’re going to ban AR-15s? Now what am I supposed to use to hunt imaginary animals?
I killed a unicorn and I put its head on my wall.
Venture capital paid for my trophy hunting.
I got that one behind the counter at Starbucks.
Sometimes the magic works, sometimes it dosen't.
Aren't unicorns on the endangered list?
It was an unusual and the most exciting safari i have ever been on.
We tried all the websites and clubs then Claire & I meet her in Washington Square Park giving away free hugs.
I bet you would have never known that all you had to do to see the last of the unicorns was walk up two flights of stairs.
Isn't hunting for endangered species illegal?
not as rare as the bicorn, but still.....
I bagged her at the Burning Man Festival.
On the horns of a dilemma.
It was an act of love with a bit of magic
Wouldn't you just know it? I was trying for narwhal and got her.
It's really a rhinoceros head, I gave it a face lift and rhinoplacie.
It was the only way to keep the myth intact!
I bagged this beauty on my safari to the deep state in the summer of '16.
How did you know each other?
Everyone I talk to about this dismisses it as fake news.
Not letting him out of my sight was a challenge, what with all his protective camouflage.
Ya know, somehow I don't think she's dead.
Yes, he's alive. His stall s behind the wall, and he pokes his head through every day to feel a part of the crowd!
We've made updates in response to recent changes to global data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.
My great-grandfather shot that one in a dream.
Evidently, our hostess bloody loves unicorns!
Gutting one of thos in a dream is messy business.
It’s a great conversation piece, but his five year old has disowned him.
Dad, where did you say you caught this one?
When I brought home the one in the middle, my wife shouted 'dik head' at me. How was I supposed to have known she wanted a dik-dik head?
Brian Williams has a very nice cabin up north. We go hunting every Fall.
The unicorn looks like it would make a great t-shirt for a Deadhead.
Even the royal taxidermy is getting the "Markle Sparkle".
Brilliant! Okay, I get it! So the Unicorn is the animal that represents Washington DC!
Who do you think is more horny?
Those ironic unicorn T-shirts just got a bit sadder, right?
I asked her to grant me a wish. She wouldn’t, so I brought her home.
That one was at Disneyworld.
Good to know that someone worries about preserving these for the future generations contemplate.
...And we bagged this guy on our trip to the matterhorn.
That one is a Dik-Dik and this one is a Dik.
It was half the price.
Really, I'm a conservationist...
Here's my taxidermy collection from each of the fifty-one states.
Bagged her in the highlands of Dementia.
Yes, I don't know how this horse could've swallowed a narwhal either, but that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
Follow your dreams.
Ah yes, I remember as if it were yesterday. I dropped him with a single shot. Elvis Presley a fine chap, was my guide, and when we picked up his trail in Atlantis...
I didn’t shoot it. I just audited it. It was named Theranos.
You mounted the wrong end. I heard they shit rainbows!
It's amazing what game a dentist can bring down these days.
Hard to find, but I bagged the last one.
I had to lure him in with fantasies of a utopian world. Then, bang, straight through the heart.
That's what you call a HOLE IN ONE!
My little girl bagged that one.
This one put up an epic tussle...if you know what I mean!
It’s worse than I thought. 24 hours a day of Fox News.
The tough part was getting her away from the Brony.
Sure, I wondered about finding a virgin to bait it, but my ex got a kick out of rubbing it in.
It would have been a big deal a few years ago but after Sandyhook nobody really seemed to notice.
By the time you are sent to pasture, the number of horns is no longer a factor...
Ryan Zinke told me it was in season.
The single horn is a real conversation beast.

There wasn't a serious bone in her body.
Corporations will do anything to make a Buck
The preserve was everything we wanted -- fine wines, elegant canapés -- but there was just something about the place I never trusted.
Trumpish, don’t you think?
When I invested in a unicorn, I thought the return would be greater.
It is pride month, you know.
She's a trophy you hunt for the eyelashes.

That’s what I figured, It’s one of my Lodge brothers.

Menage A Trois gone NRA style.
You won't believe how I bagged this one.
The expensive part was creating it.
Standard definition. Definitely Hell.
Yup. Last of a dying breed.
We were looking for a third.
We flipped a coin, and thank goodness it landed on heads.
At some point, you simply can't keep up with them anymore.
Funny thing is..we didn't set out to bag a Unicorn
...and then my daughter never spoke to me again.
Disney safari, kids these don't take no for an answer.
We got it to complement our fantasy kitchen.
Unicorn, son, not unihorn.
If the market cap drops below a billion, it turns into a Pets.com puppet head.
I told you they were real.
They say unicorns are very hard to catch
Since we’ve run out of ivory...
Seen one,..........
Only in the Silicon Valley.
Yeah, it's real.
Reality TV is what put me here in the first place.
Uncle Harry was always a fun loving guy.
It had the most comprehensive dopp kit I've ever seen.

She went the way of many a startup company, Bill.
He really wanted to be here.
I was going to fund a conservation program, but my people tell me that unicorn breeding stock are proving very difficult to locate.
This is the only channel that we have. Hope you like it.
It all started in the parking lot of the first ComiCon.
Seemed promising, but the IPO was underwhelming.
Of course I bagged it! It's not like its endangered or something, is it?
Bronies, that was a great day.
I don't know, Bill. It doesn't look very rare to me.
There came a time when I finally had to end it all.
You had to try those hamburguers. They were tasty beyond your imagination.
When I described the scene to my daughter, she looked horrified. She said, 'Dad, that was a furry convention'. The concept was absurd! I said, 'No, this is a unicorn'.
The weirdest thing is that the TV isn't a flat screen?
My family's proud that I killed the only one.
With his last gasp, I swear I heard him utter, "unique corn". I couldn't understand why he was going on about his foot!
I thought unicorns were fake.
I'm thinking of setting up the other wall with my collection of "My Little Pony" trophies.
Little Susie was the most upset.
My daughter's dating a taxidermist. She said he's very up-and-coming.

Yeah ... that party was really out of this world.

So that's what happened to Theranos

Damn! I had shares in that company.

Thankfully, we overcame unicorn privilege some time ago.
The trick is a bullet through the heart - save the face.
I prefer the deer myself, but I thought my granddaughter might like the unicorn to be in the center.
It wasn't until I got home from my trophy hunting trip that I learned she was the last of her kind.
And I shot that one in my dream. Then brought the head with me when I woke up.

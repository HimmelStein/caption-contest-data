…because no one is paying any attention to our northern border.
Why yes, I did accidentally back over our snowman. Why do you ask?
Invite them in if you want to get rid of them.
I listed our freezer on Airbnb.
Don't worry, they're armless.
Honey, I haven't seen this many fat white men in one place since the inauguration.
I believe the correct term is "snowpeople".
Don't mind them. They've just never seen a black guy in a New Yorker cartoon before.
Honey I found it. A group of snowmen is called a squall.
To be fair honey they did say they'd be back again someday.
and then I said, ' you and what army, snowflake?'.
Not exactly the twenty-four carats I was hoping for.
Do as I say. Walk slowly to the bathroom and grab a hair dryer.
That does it. I'm calling ICE.
How long have the kids been outside?
Looks like the scarf was a hit!
Well, you're just going to have to knit faster.
This article says that global warming will create an unprecedented refugee crises.

They want to watch Frozen.
I told you the suburbs lacked diversity.
I told you - make a scarf for one of them, they'd all want one.
Alexa, turn on the sprinklers.
Well, this situation certainly snowballed rather quickly.
HA!  Get this.  Amazon says it's selling snowmen...I just ordered one-thousand of them...let's see how they handle that!
Don't worry, I'm sure they will be gone by spring.
I’m telling you a collection of snowmen is called an abomination.
Ignore them.  Last time you let them in, they had a major meltdown...
No wonder the kids were so tired.
They know you work for big coal. You can see it in their eyes.
I'd knit faster if I were you.
Honey, you must read this article about how many amazing things you miss by always looking at a screen
Honey, did you list a vintage corn cob pipe on eBay?
There must have been some magic in those old wool hats you knit.
No worries.  They're not armed.
So then I took the carrot off his face and played fetch with the dog. Why?
Hey, Marge, here's a gadget that says it sends a signal that only a snowman can hear.  Can you believe that?  Honestly, people will fall for  anything.
Okay Honey, first thing tomorrow I will put up a fence . . . and have Norway pay for it.
So why do you believe climate change is already at our front door?
Of course, global warming forces species to move to new locations for survival.  Why do you ask?
It's like a Trump rally but with smarter folks
So, I says to the guy in the snowman outfit, ""Yeah? You and what army?"
Looks like your women's night ad had a typo on the "no men" wanted.
From the looks of them, I'd guess Republicans.
Would it be considered murder if we let them inside?
Waldo's four back and three from the left
This says that Greta Thunberg is influencing activism in some unexpected places.
Now you know how I feel when I go to your family reunions.
Turn up the heat, just in case...

What do you mean, you’re getting cold stares?
They've crossed  that fine line between yuletide charm and creepy.
They did say they'll be back again someday.
Another group of angry white men? What did you post this time?
You don't put out food for raccoons, and you don't knit hats for snowmen!
Don't engage.....it's going to hit 50 tomorrow.
Climate refugees, I presume.
Like I said. If you knit it, they will come.
Sure, but a short party. I'll turn up the heat and we'll be in bed by 11.
Right! A snowman flash mob. Like that's going to happen.
I may have backed in to one on my way to the store -- why?
The role of Frosty has been filled. Thank you for your interest.
Hell may have just frozen over.
I told them we welcome global warming refugees.
Dad! How many times can I tell you not to"reply all?
Put. Down. The scarf.
I told you, if you made a scarf for one of them, they'd all want one.
I know you worked hard on them, but they're starting to creep me out.
They’re probably wondering who made us too...
I think you have to say "Snow-People", dear.
It's not just the weather outside that's frightful...
Looks like your scarf  business has really snowballed, Honey.
Invite them in. I'll get the mop.
Snow 'persons' dear.
I accepted Frosty's friend request and it all just snowballed from there.
It's snowing men!
Great, now they all want a scarf.
I invited everyone to come over and chill.
It says here, if you pay no attention to them, they will go away by spring.

But of course, there are more of them. That's the snowball effect.
Yes, Karen. I always keep everything you knit for me.
Just keep knitting.....
Somehow a rumor got started that Greta Thunberg is staying here.
It’s your turn to walk the dog.
It’s called a “drift” of snowmen, dear, not a “gaggle”.
Still, it beats your mother visiting.
Are you posting about climate change being a hoax again?
...or you could just close the drapes.
Honey, call Parson Brown.
Giving them the last of our charcoal briquettes will put smiles on their faces.
Nothing to worry about. They know we have a thermostat.

I warned you he'd tell the others you knit him that scarf
I'm just saying, they might be snowwomen.
I told you this neighborhood was too white for us.
This is incredible, hon. My Instagram account says I have 100,000 snowmen following me.
A murder of crows, a pod of whales, it doesn't say what a bunch of snowmen are called.
The impeachment hearings energized his base of uneducated white men.
It was easier than shoveling.
The traditional expression is ‘a wolf at the door’, but this is fairly unsettling, too.”
Did you hear a thumpity thump thump?
The icemen cometh.
I know, honey, but to let them in would be genocide...
Well, he did say he'd be back again some day.
Jeez. What the hell happens in the second verse of “Frosty the Snowman?”
You should never have knitted that first scarf.
Do you find the new neighbors a little cold?
Most of  ‘em will leave after Jeopardy.
Put carrots on the list.
OMG! Amazon was supposed to deliver sno-cones!!!
They’ll stay out there until they learn not to make puddles in the house.
That explains why the grocery store ran out of carrots today.
So who is Parson Brown?
I miss Calvin and Hobbes too.
I can’t believe we wasted all that money beefing up the southern border.
Illegals from Antarctica.
Don't worry, they don't have the balls to come in.
Yes, I may have posted something about making snow women. Why do you ask?
I guess it doesn’t surprise me they are all white and male.
Look, darling, it seems our all-white neighborhood is still adjusting to our mixed race marriage.

Chill out hun, they'll be gone by April.
Yes dear, there are still three without hats.
They only *think* they want to sit by the fire.
Would you describe their stares as “cold” or “frosty”
Don’t worry. They’re snowflakes
I’m going to need more yarn.
Only 126 scarves to go.
It seems our new home was built on a snowman burial ground.
According to this, we're on their migratory path from North Dakota.
Wow. I have to say I'm very surprised. Did it even occur to you that they could be snow women?
Don't worry, it's for their own good.
They want us to do something about global warming
The kids have had way too many snow days this year.
You shouldn’t have called the first one abominable.
Knit one a pair of socks and let's see what he does.
You're anti coal and a vegetarian.  You had to know they would come for you.
No worries. I’ll set up a firewall.

I guess the icemen cometh...
Don't make eye contact. Close the drapes!
Honey... Get the salt.
Without the scarf, he’s just a snowman. With it, he’s the alpha.
You had to give the scarf to the one who's an Instagram influencer.
Maybe it's time for Calvin to come inside.
Just the sight of a hair dryer should do the trick.
Well honey, at least someone appreciates your hand-knitted scarves this year."
He said he’d be back again some day, but he didn’t say he’d be bringing all of his damn relatives.
But they need SOMETHING so I can tell them apart.
I misread the forecast.  It wasn't "lots of snow, man."
I still say, snowman flash mobs are just creepy.
They did say this was a very white neighborhood ...
Maybe it's our neighbors' way of saying they don't need any more of your knitwear.
say what you will, but I think the  Klan is much less intimidating in their holiday outfits
Stop worrying. It's an unarmed revolt.
I thought this would stop when we moved to Miami.

While you're on Amazon, I'm going to need a lot more wool.

They're just drifters.
I’ve got chills; they’re multiplying.
I wondered what happened to all our carrots.
Relax. Come spring all your concerns will just melt away.
They didn't predict this much accumulation.
Oh,the weather outside is frightening
Same thing every year.  All men.
In the meadow we should have made some snowwomen too.
I told you this would happen. This is just like that time you fed a stray cat.
Call Greta

Told you we needed a border wall with Canada
They say they will continue the protest until Trump rejoins the Paris Accords.
You're thinking of the terracotta army.

I had to order that many just to get free shipping.
It's just some more of those climate change activists.
It looks like the whole movement snowballed.
Just don’t make eye contact. Spring is only a few months away.
I really don’t think this is just seasonal affect disorder.
All white, with knit scarves and toques, is NOT diversity.
George, there truly isn’t a thing worth looking up from your laptop for, is there?
The forecast does say that the weather outside is frightful.

They all turn out to be great, but it never lasts
They want us to save them.  We're the only democrats in the county.

Well honey, you were wrong about the election...it’s looking a lot  like hell has frozen over!
So this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a "Thumpety-thump-thump look at Frosty go."
Day 526 since the uprising. We are running out of tea and cookies. Margaret is beginning to lose faith in my assurances. I, too, begin to doubt if help will ever come.

Funny, we all thought it would be zombies.
Honey, get the hairdryer
They don't ALL need hats, dear.
You’re the only one I know who can take something as innocent as a snowman and turn it into a problem
The expression is, “no two snowFLAKES are alike”.
It's not the weather outside that's frightful.
I don't know, we only got 3 maybes on the evite.
I think I might have pressed the order button a few too many  times.
They're demanding we reduce our carbon footprint to save their lives.

Oh no, they’re back for mittens.
Well Shirley, this is New Hampshire. Everyone runs for President.
Looks like the silent majority is here to watch the trial of the president.
We should have never hooked those two up.
Hurry up with those hats and scarves. They’re getting restless.
Can we turn the thermostat back up now?
I think maybe they're protesting global warming!
Only a few caps to go, dear.  Then they'll be on their way."
Supposed to be frosty out tonight.
Honey...Have you ordered anything on ebay lately?
I don't know if we fit in here, Jeff.

I really need to stop answering with 'reply all'."
Don't stare, you're just encouraging them.
Maybe they're looking for Parson Brown.
Looks like we'll need a border fence with Canada, too.
Like I always say, Lydia, if you give a snowman a magical knit cap, you give him life for a day; if you teach him to knit, he'll reproduce and take over the planet with snow zombies.
It's an email from the White house; "Do you remember sending me that rotten pumpkin on Halloween, You loser?"
On second thought,  let's stay in!

I’m guessing we will need to order about 300 corncob pipes.
Maybe we need to take Billy off the Ritalin.
Of course he told his friends who knitted his scarf.
Did you let the dog in?
What did your company do this time, Harold?  The climate activists are back.

This is the last time I am using Meet Up.
Don’t mind them. They are just here to confront you about your ‘global warming is a hoax’ article.
It seems my post praying for a warming trend has sparked mass protests.
Ignore them. Eventually, they'll vanish.
Tell them it’s true. It’ll be warmer every year from now on.
Did you just tweet something cynical about global warming?
Nope. ‘’Zombie Snowman Mob’ isn’t mentioned in any of the AirBnB reviews.

Climate change activists are getting more aggressive
It’s the one with the tall cap that creeps me out.
Now can I turn the heat on?
Honey, have you heard about this 'Million Snowmen March?' Apparently they're Christmas caroling at the homes of sexual predators, singing, 'Baby It's Cold Outside...'
Your flaky family arrived
Honey, I think I know where my scarf went.
Snombies.
Apparently, they're attracted to the scent of wool.
I googled it,  a large group of snowmen is called a “Mound”
It says to NOT put a mouth on them.
You shouldn't have given Jimmy that "Calvin and Hobbes" book.
Let's not panic ... there's a warm front due tonight.
Your followers aren’t any more real than mine
‘May I suggest we start a family with a longer lifespan ?’
Don't let them intimidate you. They're just a bunch of overgrown snowflakes.
The new neighbours are friendly but a bit cold.
No...I’ve never considered moving to Florida - why do you ask?
Honey, remind me, on which day of Christmas do the snowmen come a-lurking?
Looks like Greta Thunberg’s fans are here.
Exclusively in our zoo: a human couple in their natural habitat. Danger of extinction: endangered species.
There is talk about a Northern Wall....
The non-binary, gender fluid, pansexual snow people have arrived.
Don't worry dear, they're merely the ghosts of climates past.
Sometimes it feels like climate change is right at our doorstep.
Maybe I shouldn’t have said apply in person.
OK, the corn-cob pipe giveaway was a bad idea.
What the Hell are you ordering, Stan?
Don't worry, dear. I'm sure they'll melt before they get to the lords a- leaping.
Oops, wrong world...
Closing the curtains isn't going to make it better, Bob.
Must be your side of the family.
If you ignore them for long enough,they will just go away.
And not one has a mouth to speak out against climate change
Honey, I think I found the missing hats.
How long did that take you?
Sabrina, I've told you a million times before... You can't just give a bunch of snowman life without expecting them to realize the brevity of their existence.
That's the last time I troll Frosty on Social Media.
'Call 911, I'll get the salt'
Nothing about snow men, just clear and frosty tonight.
It’s not a mob, honey—they’re climate refugees.
We can’t let them in.  They’ll  just pee all over the rug.
Webmd said you can try a hair dryer.
When does your family arrive, again?
I’m taking down your Etsy page until spring.
The new neighbor’s kid? Calvin - why do you ask?
Now can we turn the heat up?
We’re gonna need more yarn.
Honey, they said Spring begins tomorrow...and they know you own a cold storage warehouse.
You used the Internet to get them here. Now use it to send them back.
Honey, you're going to need to learn to knit faster.
Look carefully and you'll find Waldo.
Honey... did the doc say anything about side effects?
I may have implied that I perfected an anti-melting device.
I was just thinking, how lucky we are to live out here in the woods with no nosey Neighbors to intrude on our privacy.
An open casting call is always a big mistake.
We are going to have a real flood when they melt
I guess global warming has its perks, right?
It says here that snow zombie attacks are increasing due to global warming.
If you turn off the Pandora Holiday station they’ll probably go away.
Keep knitting; the waitlist has snowballed.
See what you started, honey?  Now all his friends want scarves too.
I was right.  It's a "pack" of killer snowmen, not a "herd".
I hate, hate, hate casting for Christmas cartoons!
But they're saying it's cold outside.
It certainly is creepy when Alexa hears you talking in your sleep.
I'm sorry you're cold, but you must see how coming inside isn't the answer.
How cute- they are christmas carroting.
Just ignore them honey, they'll be gone by spring.
What have we got in the fridge?
They must have heard we have Disney Plus.
They're Jesnowva's Witnesses.
Good question. Let me check the forecast...
Frosty was a prolific sperm donor.
Remember, with carrots, size doesn't matter.
It DOES seem cruel, but it's for their own good.
I knew they'd be back again someday.
I can't find any patterns for carrot warmers.
Can we just leave you our Snowman's Witnesses brochure?
Where’s the remote? I think they want to watch “Frosty” again.
Where do you think I've been bringing all the hats you knit?
They're willing to strike if we don't find an alternative to coal.
Would you just PLEASE give them your scarf and cap this year!
Yeah, we probably shouldn't have let our snowman use the bathroom last night.
Honey, what did you Google?
Frozen 3: With a Vengeance
Jerry is not wearing his hat again.
Oh, that's the neighbor boy, Calvin.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Tomorrow he will go back to playing with his tiger toy.
I don't care if they stand there all night--we're not giving them our wi-fi password.
We really should have put up the snow fence.
What reminds you of Hitchcock?
They're a hell of a lot cuter than the stink bugs that invaded last year.
Oh so the moon’s not interesting enough huh?
It’s “snowmaggedon,” not “snowman-geddon.”  That’s not a thing.
Well, according to this, it’s some kind of strike against global warming
What, you’d prefer Zombies?
Yup, looks like they found you on Etsy.
Not to worry, dear, they're climate control activists.  They won't be here long.
Just relax...they'll be puddles in the spring.
Okay, later tonight it will change from abominable to merely frightening.
I wish we lived in a more diverse neighborhood
Zuckerberg's got around the ban on location tracking.
How do our neighbours find the time?
White Snowpremacy
Yeah, white power is a thing.
Tell them we're woke and it's the last year we're using carbon based facial features.  And corn cob pipes were never a thing, anyway.
I told you -- now they ALL want one.
It's OK, honey. The news says to just stay indoors and have your blow-dryer ready.
I told you this would happen if you started knitting them free scarves and hats.
Pay no attention to them. They don’t know they’ll melt if they come inside.
Hon, did you put something in the eggnog?
Snowman (they, them)
Not a single snow woman
No wonder they were out of carrots at Safeway
Weird, not many bids on most of the stuff but I have a thousand people watching the walk in freezer.
George, I think you've Twitter flamed the wrong group this time.
They heard you keep the house at 32. I don't have the heart to tell them that's Celcius.
If we give them money, they'll just blow it on corn cob pipes.
It is like feeding stray cats dear.  If you keep making hats and scarves for them, they are never going to go away.
I'm not the one who said we have plenty of room in the freezer.
See, now they all want you to knit them a scarf.
Honey, have you seen the kids?
No, no! I said I wanted a Christmas present with lots of CARATS.
I told you, if you feed one we’re going to have a problem.
Don't let them in they'll just make a mess and disappear
We forgot to make them any snow women
Calvin was bored his afternoon.
According to Accuweather, the snowman apocalypse is expected tomorrow.
I said I'm busy! If there was a snow man apocalypse I'm sure we would hear about it.
It's a life sized "Where's Waldo" You see him?
i wonder if anyone noticed that I swiped a snowman with my car earlier today,
Better turn the heat up.
And you questioned my concern with having our home address on the internet?
Quick  honey. Turn the heat up.
I don't think it's dangerous to deny climate change. Why?
On the bright side, at least they don’t need mittens.
I'm googling 'flame throwers' .
Honey, do we still keep the hairdryer in the safe with the gun?
Ok, give me another sustainable use for coal.
Sure, I've trashed a few snowmen in my day. What makes you ask
No worries, they’ll disappear in the spring.
The Million Snowman March should be passing by our house right about now.
The scarf went viral.
They say there's no business like snow business!
I told you so. Now they ALL want a hat.
They prefer to be called "climate change activists."
Again? I'll get the blow dryer.
We got a good response to our ad.  Now pick one already.
It says they're protesting climate change.
Honey, do you mind answering the doorbell?
They won't leave until they all get scarves.
According to the Internet it's called a 'flurry of snowmen.' That's cute.
Well, they did say they'd be back again someday.
Honey, we're going to need a lot more yarn.
I'll get the salt.
It's the Zamboni Apocalypse.
I found a great carrot cake recipe
It's raining cats and dogs down south but nothing about snowmen locally
I warned you. You knit one of them a scarf, they’re all going to want scarves.
Well, well. Looks like the Klan has adopted a new winter uniform.
It appears to be a global warming protest
I’m just so used to offering the carrot and then the sticks—they went for it!
They want to know if the ice cubes can come out and play.
I don't know, but I'll bet Greta Thunberg's behind it.
Get the hairdryer.
It says here "side effects may include paranoia and chills."
It’s gonna be tough getting used to being the only humans in the neighborhood
I’m knitting as fast as I can!
You need to charge more for your hats.
Should we put the closed captions on for them?
I warned you not to give one of them a scarf!
Maybe they ought to think about securing the Northern border.
They say it's going to be a killer frost.
Now you see why I told you not to let that one in. Now we'll never get rid of them.
They are with the Global Warming Initiative and they claim they are melting. They want me to vote "YES" on the Climate Change Bill.
Why, that’s my screensaver.
Can you beat that? My screen just froze again!
Oh dear! I really wish you hadn't posted our snow woman on Facebook!
We really should have taken a look at the packaging of the fertilizer first.
I just donated to crazy Aunt Beatrice's  Bring the Snowmen
to Life Go Fund Me page
Hunny, why is there a charge for three hundred carrots?
Like I said, if you leave cocoa and cookies for Santa, news gets around.
I found it.  It's called a globe of snowmen.
The new neighbors sure are nosy...
Winter really snuck up on us this year.
I wished for a concert by Chopin not snowmen.
Honey, can you google what snow patrol means?
They heard about the snow woman we made last year.
No matter how pathetic they look, we can't bring them in the house!
I told you there'd be trouble with the white neighbors.
I told them we have Frozen 2 on DVD.....
So when is your family arriving again?
Will you turn off the porch light dear?
Ignore them. The protest should end by next March.
Ignore them.  They just want attention.
I think the kids next door have been playing snowman apocalypse in our yard again.
Chill
Their cable is out again.
text: Frosty, your friends are here. You can party in the rec room, but keep a mop handy!
I think we need to reduce Billy's adderall dose.
Build it and they will come, sure. But when will they leave?
That's why you should never leave beer outside to cool it off.
I told you we shouldn’t have built that house on top of that ancient snowman burial ground.
This never happened when we lived in Florida.
Move to Canada, they said . . . they have free universal healthcare, they said
Here's what you posted: "New in town, single, winter soul, seeks curvy man with dark, smoky eyes. Must love hand-knit apparel."
If we let them in they'll just want back out again.
Next time why don't you face them the other way, honey.
If they want to come in, let them come in. But they're not going to like what happens next.
I'm ordering now. How many need hats?
Tell them we already have a church.
We have flood insurance, right?
We know what you did last winter.
How could you not like winter?
Apparently it's a Frosty flash mob!
Ha Honey, will you look at this, Tweeter is blowing up with some crazy zombie snowman conspiracy
Just tell them Trump says global warming is a hoax. That should put a smile back on their faces.
What makes you want to know how the "March of the Penguins" ended?
Anyone want a snow-clone
Corn cob pipes are still on backorder.
This article says that angry white men are on the move.
It’s just their way of thanking you for the carrots.
Ok, I'll delete the tweet.
Whoa! I guess word got out that we gave Frosty that hat.
I'd say knit faster.
Tell them Elsa and Anna have moved and they're trespassing.
I guess we're snowed in.
Honey I think I see Waldo.
I'm crowd-sourcing the New Year's Eve party invitations.
They want us to reduce our carbon footprint.
Do I really have to explain to you why you can't let them in to warm up?
I'll get the flamethrower over-nighted.
Honey, did you see this ridiculous news article about Zombie Snow-Men terrorizing the area... silly... must be fake news.
Have you tried this new dating app yet?
Google calls it the “Minnesota Zombie Apocalypse”. They’re not dangerous, just judgmental.
I swear that one winked at me.
They seem upset that we didn't build any snowwomen.
Honey, I think we should have gone to the climate-action rally...
Sure, we don't have to worry about stolen packages anymore but don't you think the neighbourhood watch has gone a little too far?
I hardly think a few snowmen are going to bring about the end of the world.
Oh, here it is.  The Snowman's Association will be meeting at....they got the address wrong.
They're climate refugees.
Snopes says the  zombie snowman apocalypse is a myth
Have you been feeding the snowmen again Sarah?
I hope you like like carrot soup
Sweety, I told you what would happen if you gave it a scarf.
They want us to change the Yule log channel.
Ok try snow person removal
Give us all your buttons, or else.
It’s the Frosty apocalypse.
I'm sure the dog is fine outside; he's not bothering anyone.
Sharon, maybe you shouldn't have tweeted about Frosty.
Don't worry Annie, the sun will come out tomorrow
I'm ordering you a flame thrower, sweetie.
Somebody leaked my casting call for “Frozen 3” extras.
Looks like Frosty met a snow-woman...
Oh, swell!  Now they ALL want scarves.
I told you posting that Craigslist ad would get a lot of responses.
Begging for Shelter! Climate change is coming
A bunch of angry white males."
It's the Frosty Posse on climate change again,George
Oh, it's just another Global Warming protest.
Abominable aren't they?
Don't worry, they're just Russian bots.
I think they’ve come to free their brother in my snow globe.
They’re really not very bright. They think this is the pre-game show.
Where's global warming when you need it?
What did I tell you? Knit one of them a scarf and they'll all want one.
That's odd, I have 62,000 new friend requests.
Tell me a little about your paranoia
All right. Carrots. Snow formations. A sense of being watched. Any other symptoms?
The only way to deal with them is with a carrot or stick approach.
It says “The weather outside is frightful “.
Frosty invited all his friends over....
You're right -- it IS colder in here than it is outside.
How thoughtful, Amazon anticipated our need for fresh carrots and hats.
Just close the drapes. They’ll go away when the sun comes out.
Tape your carrot cake and carrot soup recipes on the window. They’ll leave
Well, your Tinder profile does say that you like Cold Play.
Their email says they want to have some fun before they melt away
I'm having a Hallmark moment."
They're mad we changed the wifi password
Honey, I think your “Frozen II” tweet has gone viral.
What kind of tea did you say this is?
No. No.  You know perfectly well why we can’t let them in from the cold.
It turns out they’ve been building the wall on the wrong border.
These climate change protesters have no boundaries.
No, but I saw a guy on our lawn this morning with a stuffed tiger and a slightly demented look on his face.
Nope. Control-alt-delete doesn’t work.
Just act natural. That’s what they’re here for.
Honey, Where’s Waldo?
What's the thing after the thing about chestnuts?
Did it snow today?
If they scare you, invite them in.
Don't mind us we just chill'n
They think they just found their ice queen.
It says here the Klan is changing its image.
You're only hurting them when you try to make them warmer.
If you believe this forecast, they'll all be gone by the weekend.
Looks like Frosty was busy last winter.
I understand their concerns about global warming but these requests  for weather updates are starting to get annoying.
If you knit it, they will come.
Is Jimmy off his meds again?
Wait a minute, it's not even snowing
The one with the scarf is creeping me out.
I am looking at the cost of your knitting supplies. How is that possible?
Did you know that if you hold down this button, the screen fills up with emojis?
What did you think would happen after you called them a bunch of snowflakes?

Feel like I'm getting a cold stare
Joe, I think they're hungry.
How could I have known the scarf I made last week would end up on a snowman influencer?

I miss the time when the snow came down as flakes, and you had to make you're own snowman.
I warned you he would tell his friends about that scarf you made him.
Tell them we can't do anything about global warming.
They're coming to get you Barbara ...
I have the diversity committee meeting on my calendar for next week.
Better to be the inside looking out than the other way around, right?
They all want a bedtime story on climate change.
It looks like the neighbors were in our garden picking their noses.
OK Maryanne....I'll take down those Halloween photos of you in the sexy snowgirl costume....
Most of these reviews recommend just getting one with 9.6 cubic feet of capacity. Why?
Now bring us some figgy pudding...we won't go until we get some.
Well if you stop knitting them honey, maybe cooler heads will prevail.
We can't just leave them out in the cold.
If you’re going to knit, don’t forget to shut the curtains.
I’m ‘Googling’ ‘snowmen grievances’ right now.
Alexa, release the boiling cauldron.
Says here tonight's a killing frost.
As I warned you, "Knit it and they will come."

They heard Thunberg's on at six.
Those carolers must have been out there for a long time.
Turn off the heat; our guests have arrived.
I warned you about annoying that kid and his stuffed tiger.
You shouldn't have thrown those snowballs
From my count, there are still 6 more who need knitted caps.
I tried to tell you, knit a hat for one, they are all going to want one.
I’m telling you, underneath is a much darker agenda...
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all...it's fear. Merry Christmas.
I think they want to come in from out of the cold
This silly auto correct...  I was trying to order a snow-cone machine, not a snow-man one.  But damn, Amazon Prime is quick.

those old silk hats you made.
Ils sont les bonhommes de neiges d'antan.
No, I don't think you'll have all their hats finished in time.
JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL FROM FROZEN 2
They say they are not leaving till they each have a  hat and a scarf.
I'm surprised there are carolers when it's so cold out.
And then as they start to melt, they'll need them in smaller sizes.

I think I’m going to need more yarn...
I've been trying to tell you it's really, really cold in here.
Did you leave the gate open?
I told you to never use frostythesnowman100 as your password

Seems like everyone's looking forward to the Frozen rebroadcast!
It's raining men
Do they seem  annoyed to you? I’m almost out of yarn.
Hmm. That's weird -- what do you think cloudy with a chance of snowmen means?
O.K., but it's not like climate change will be ALL bad.
I’m reading this new Steven King book, want to know what it’s about?
Yeah, every year. The Frosty special will be starting in a few minutes.
"I think it's about time we send little Sammy to therapy, Dear

They didn't like that joke about global warming that you sent to The New Yorker.
Hun, turn off the lights and throw another log on the fire?
Hey honey, it says here that tomorrow will be sunny and warm.
It may have something to do with those abominable cookies you baked earlier today.
Did you make any snow women?
Are they caroling or protesting climate change?
My Craigslist ad for the corncob pipes seems to be getting a lot of hits.
Let’s see, a “flock of sheep,” a “gaggle of geese” and, here it is, a “synod of snowmen.”
Hold on hon, I'm captioning a cartoon.
Honey, I think you might have overdone it just a bit on the Christmas decorations.
There must have been some magic in those 512 silk wool hats you knitted.

Honey, the snowmen are back.
I guarantee these climate change protests die out come springtime.
Snowden says that there is no privacy anymore.
They upgraded our order from snow cones to snow clones.
It’s snowmen honey. Snowmans sounds so ridiculous.
It says we’ll be okay if we can fend them off until tomorrow. Then climate warming will take care of it.
I don’t know why they’re so fascinated with knitting.  It’s not like they have hands.
Don't let them in they'll wet all over everything....
Honey, please get the space heater in the basement. Now.
They'd like you to try whipstitching so the edges don't fray on the hats and scarves so easily.
Sorry to be THAT guy, honey, but I can't see a sustainable future for your business model.
I don't think they're friendly, Jeff. They've taken the Subaru.

And you think my emailing
intrudes on our marriage?
Are you sure we're the only ones who have Netflix in the area?
I thought carolers needed mouths to sing.
I wouldn’t mind some carrot cake.
Well, at least they don’t have their broomsticks in their hands.
Well, hun, Frosty did say he'd be back again some day.  I don't recall that it'd be for more knit scarves.
Babe, I told you so, you give that one guy a scarf and they’ll all want a scarf.
This polar refugee problem is really heating up.
You tell them global warming isn’t a real threat.
Put carrots on the shopping list.
I told you we should have built a wall
Frosty is on in five minutes.
I think it's time to turn the heat up and light a fire.
These gummies are doing nothing for me. How about you?
I ordered a snow person.  Oops I may have ordered a city full.

Just more global warming refugees.

I told them they could watch. The don't get Netflix.
John, remember how I made that scarf for your snowman? Apparently he's got friends.
Calm down.  I just don't understand why its a big deal that there's no men in the yard.
No really, sing 'Do you want to build a snowman?' one more time.
No need to worry, darling. We're safe until they start to thumpity thump thump.
You asked what I'm watching. I'm streaming Frosty online.
It's a Pee-Too movement.
They want our grandson to stop urinating on them.
Honey, there's a protest rally against global warming outside.

Honey...turn the heater up.
Harry, How did you vote on that climate change bill!!?
hmmm... technically, these are white men so, technically, this isn’t terrorism
Of course they are upset. Border Patrol locked up all their children, Trump wants to negotiate a trade agreement with the North Pole, and with the failure of addressing climate change they will be nothing but puddles.
They heard you complaining about the lack of heat.
I have a strange feeling we're being watched.
Are you shopping today?  We're running low on carrots.

Fine I’ll go get the snowblower.
Tell them "Trick or Treat" was in October.
On the 28th day of Christmas my true love gave to me...
Where’s Calvin?
I don’t know why they can’t hold their Parson Brown look-alike contest in the meadow.
I knew your hats would be a big hit.
I was wondering what the weatherman meant by snowing with a chance of thumpety thump thump
Did you mistreat snowmen last year?
Tell them we gave at the office.
NO!  If you let them in, they’ll wet all over the place.
According to the news, there's a huge carrot shortage this December.
I thought it only flurried last night...
Your flash mob is here
Stop teasing. You've neither enough time nor wool.
Don’t worry honey, they will all be gone by spring along with most of the democratic presidential candidates.
They’re not cold, dear.  They’re just hungry for human brains.
I wonder if this has something to do with that politically correct version of "Baby It's Cold Outside."
Honey, remember that snowman you kicked at the park yesterday?

But according to this, they're not ALLOWED to accept tips.

On the bright side, no sleeves required.
We’re out of carrots?  Again?
Next they'll be wanting you to knit them gloves.
I told you those hats were magical!"

Honey, we’re going to need more carrots.

You knit one scarf, for one snowman.
It's a mass suicide. I'm not letting them in.
Any carrot cake left ?
Honey, for once there are people paying attention to your stuff. You're not going to complain.
Way cooler than zombies
Apparently Frosty is missing.
I only searched "snowman" one time
I told them that if I let them inside, they’d melt. They said that’s what they wanted. I just don’t feel totally comfortable being an accessory to their Heaven’s Gate reenactment. I mean, I know they’re alive, but do they have souls?
'Well if it's acting hungry, just feed it' you said.  'What's the worst that could happen', you said.
Well... that snowballed quickly...
Remember when Frosty said he'd be back again someday?
Did you Tip the Snowmen last year?
They're going from house to house to get out the progressive vote... They're worried about global warming.
I think I see the one we made when we were six
Don’t have a meltdown, they’re just chillin’ out there.
I need some space, honey
Just remember what happened to the rug the last time you let them in.
My knitting brings all the snow boys to the yard.
I told you if you give him a hat he'll come back for a whole jacket. And maybe bring friends.

Is "Frosty The Snowman" on TV again tonight"
I'm not being racist … white folk really do all look alike.
I told you to stop knitting for them.
Oh dear, maybe we shouldn’t serve carrots tonight.
I really don’t think it matters if the yarn is cotton or acrylic.
Don't feed them,they'll be here til spring.

I did warn you that if you knitted  a hat for one of them, they’d 
all want one.
You had to blog about Frostette, the snowgirl, didn't you?
I expect some of them are doubtful you can meet production targets that will assure they all have both a hat and scarf by Christmas ... this year.

How do they have sex?
Should I order more carrots?
That's so funny! They think it's a diorama!

Better take those artesian snowcones out of the freezer or there might be trouble.
A frosty mob’s outside.
Says here, "Annual 'Frosty' movie expected to draw record numbers."
In hindsight, the snow cone was an unwise dessert choice.

I told you so. Knit it and they will come.
Has Clark finished his snowman yet?
Watch what happens when I change the app setting to 'Summer'.

Turn up the thermostat.  Maybe they'll go away.
Isn’t there supposed to be a panda hidden in that crowd?
They said our new neighbors were cold but they seem pretty friendly to me.

Check myweather.com, Arthur.  Our only hope is a warm front.
Marvin, did you post our snow blower on ebay?
Just give them the scarf!
Honey, someone besides us is worrying about global warming..
Word on the street is that you got me a snowblower for Christmas.
Remember how all those old Christmas specials were being "re-animated"...?

Got going on their mittens yet?
Disguising 500 kilos of coke as snowmen on our front lawn can only work for so long, Alejandro. Also... should I be concerned? They look, um, eerily sentient and super alert. Or, is that just me? I've done a tremendous amount of blow."
Honey, I'm afraid all those carrots we put out for the deer have been commandeered for unspecified corrupt purposes.

Honey, I told you if you made one a scarf, they'd all want one.
Here I found it ; what to do in case of...

Just ignore them. They will be gone by noon tomorrow
Get the juicer - get the juicer!
Don't worry I'm sending each of them their money right now!
Please do not tap on the glass.

Well, you said wanted a large group around for Christmas.
Looks like Frosty's had a few...
We really should build that wall on the Canadian border.
I told you not to throw that primordial soup out on the lawn.
I suppose this is the kids' revenge for putting coal in their stockings.
I think they heard that you won’t let us touch the thermostat.
Did you order a corn cob pipe?
I'm seeing a lot of activity on your Etsy shop.
Are they looking for shelter from the snow squall?
Maybe we should rethink selling your Grandpa’s old pipe?
Those genetically modified carrots worked a little TOO well.
I'm going to email the repair center for the fridge. The ice maker has been acting up a bit.
Never mind them, honey: they're just waiting for hell to freeze over.
Please, honey, even though they asked, don't tell them what Google says about climate change!
Better let the one with the scarf in, you know he must be cold.
Are they ALL expecting new scarfs before Christmas this year?
"They're from France"
I told you don't feed them and they'll go away, but did you listen?
What do you think of carrots instead of broccoli?
I’m not sure our move from Florida was a good idea.
I told you that you've been very frosty here of late.
I warned you not to feed the stray snowman.

They want to use our wi-fi signal.
Eeeeew!  They all have runny carrots.
Just one scarf? They’re like pigeons honey...
The New Yorker just reviewed my "I Know What Happened To Frosty"  publication.
My knitting by the window and your ALL CAPS snow alert seem to be causing this.
I never thought I'd say this, but maybe the boys should be playing more video games?
Honey I think they want to come inside"
"Don't worry sweetheart it's just global warming
There are about 10 of us in need of scarves.
We are looking for the Snow King.

It says here they're concerned about climate change, and the best thing is to ignore them.
Honey! Are we building a wall in the North, as well?
I told you not to feed the snowman or else  he’d be back with friends.
Ignore them or it'll be another 6 weeks of winter.
Don't worry dear, the forecast is for rain and temps in the 40s overnight.  They won't need any more hats.

''Damn those kids.''
It may be time to retire Hobbs, honey.
Honey, which white nationalist group were you in a Tweet war with?
Can we bring them in? They look warm.
Honey, YOU should gaze at me longingly without a crude comment sometime.
Now they all want a scarf, too.
When I ordered that silk hat on line, was it a mistake to let the app use my location?
They heard about global warming.
Carrot warmers shouldn't take too much yarn.
I'm looking for some ways to increase our carbon footprint.

For your sake, I hope you made enough for all of them.

The Weather Service just issued a Snowman Squall Warning.
Frosty the Snowman, man, man, man...
Must watch T.V.
Well, Roselyn, we had a good run, but it was only a matter of time.
By the time you get those carols on your laptop,
they will melt!
You have got to stop wording things
Until you started giving them caps and scarves it hadn't occurred to me that they might be cold.
I just need to finish knitting them one more hat and then they'll give us your father back.
We could turn the heat up, but think of the money we’re saving.
I feel like buying a snow cone machine is a mistake.
Honey, the carrot harvest is ready!
Is there something I should know?
Look, honey... Night of the Frozen Heads.
This homelessness thing is getting WAY out of hand . . .
Honey, you need to just ignore them and they’ll go away.

No, I haven't seen Calvin.  Why?
Ignore them, they'll all be gone by morning.

Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he multiplied one day
How do you spell Frosty?
Making friends is so much harder when you work from home.
Honey I saw a post online
that said there may be a market for your knitted goods
I guess the Christmas white walker sequel is being filmed
Tell them they won't do next day delivery on the corn cob pipes
I wouldn't worry about them. It's supposed to be 70 tomorrow.
Apparently it's call snowcial media and you have a lot of likes.
When you've seen one snowman, you've seen them all.
Maybe you should turn up the heat?
Can you imagine how many carrots will be in the front hard if that warm front comes through?
Lucky for you they don't wear socks.
They say a little paranoia os normal with Seasonal Affective Disorder.”

Listen To This:
Climate Refugees from North
Pole  May Look Friendly But

I think I'd better stop backing up that snowman file.
On the upside, we've got carrots for months.

Loving you feels different during the holidays.
The Frosty family sure has grown."
I'm knitting a 16-5/8 fitted snow cap, why do you ask?
You better get busy.  Looks like scarves are the hot gift this year.
Just tell them they have to purchase it on Etsy like everybody else.”
How many more hats do you think I should knit?
So it seems I'm not the only one who thinks you're frigid.
That's the last time I use Amazon Prime to order carrots.
Breaking news this morning says there was a run on carrots at the local grocery.
Hon! When I said I wanted to get chills on our holiday, 
I didn't mean this.
They must have heard I bought a new snow blower.
You know Jimmy is making too many snowmen when I'm ordering another dozen carrots. How many hats and scarfs you have left to make?
How many times do I have to tell you to only hit “send” once?
You can animate anything you can think of with this new app.
Look Honey, I think Waldo’s here.
Looks like there's a carrot convention in town.
Well at least we know that they didn't cross from the southern border.
I've invited a chill group of pals over tonight.
On the forum they say it's not an issue these ones, they bring their own veggies and go away in spring
As long as your emailing Santa, ask him for a safe room.
We all like warm hugs!
How do they always know when Frosty is on?
I suppose these greedy bastards now want mittens.
Ignore them, they are collecting for one of those solstice religions.
Weather guy is predicting that a warm front will be passing through tonight.

Well, we knew we were moving to Meadowlands.
Don't you think you went too far when you called out their white fragility?
And this was just before the zombies began to melt away
This gives me pause about global warming
Well, Bill Waterson won’t be happy with any caption!
Okay, I Googled: “What to do during a Snowman Apocalypse?” And it says to just... chillax?
I accidentally added three zeros. Maybe I can undo that before spring.

No, they can't come in to get warm
The weather says they should melt by Tuesday.
Honey, its  those refugees again... When  will they ever learn-- that "trick-or-treat"ing is only in October, and not in December?
Your Amazon order for more yarn will be here on Tuesday. Why?
They're wondering why you don't melt.
They’re not your friends, Jo. It’s raining and they know our Furnace isn’t working.
According to Ancestry you are related to Frosty
I told you they wanted LAPTOPS for Christmas.
I'm going to cancel the snowman order!
Do you hear what I hear?
Dear Susan, 
There are several snowmen lingering outside my window. I assume it could only be you to have paid someone to do this; to remind me how upset  you are that we didn’t have kids. I love this idea. These ones are temporary and nutritious.
Yeah, that new kid next door - Calvin something - was out making them all afternoon.
Frosty called for a flash mob.
I prefer using buttons as noses on snowmen.
Too much V-8
I think one of them saw you make roasted carrots for Thanksgiving.
I told you we shouldn’t have bought that big freezer.
The trick-or-treaters are still here, they've just changed they costumes.
That's odd -- weather forecast says 60% chance of snowzombies tonight...
It says here that they’re related to the White Walkers, but they thrive on cookies instead of babies.

Honey, do you still have you old flamethrower?
Darling, CLOSE YOUR COMPUTER, QUICK!
It says that a new group is pushing a global warming initiative.
They said it was going to get pretty frosty this week
It's how Klansmen dress for the holidays up here.
Ahhh...sadly, it's the same answer as last April...there just isn't enough room in our freezer.

Four more toques to go.
OK, you can let them in now, I found a carrot stew recipe.
I forgot to remind you but our snowman try-outs are tonight.
Don’t worry.  They’ll be melted by morning.
Just ignore them.  They don’t know that they’ll melt if you let them in.
it's the christms episode of The Walking Dead filming here,honey
If you keep making up reasons not to go outside this cartoon will go the way of the carol.
Seems like they're pretty tight knit.
I hate to say I told you so, but letting that wizard make you queen of the snowmen was a terrible idea.
The forecast says, “weather frightful until morning.”
Hey! Would you put that damn light out?
It says they easily get mesmerized by their own reflections--lets try closing the curtains.
Dear did you pay the snow plow bill?
Don't worry. A good January thaw will solve that problem.
Darling, did you know that today is Chas-Addams-Memorial-Day?
I didn’t think they would all be back again on the same day.
Waldo's Home! He brought some friends.
They want to search for the elf-on-a-shelf's new location.
Yes, I smell carrots too. Why do you ask?
I think you better  google " a whole lot of snowmen".
I told you to turn the AC down.”
It’s just the usual rant about climate change.
You better start making more hats, your online store is sold out.
The hatless are always with us.
Looks like Frosty brought more friends to the knitting circle.
I feel like a winter ornament when you don’t pay any attention to me.
Just turn on the Cats trailer and they’ll leave
Let it go.  Once spring comes, this labor unrest will melt away.
The site Snowman Zombie Apocalypse says they could be carnivores, vegetarians or carolers."

You’ll be alright, just don’t do anything Naughty.

We were all at the bar together and well ...
I think there’s something wrong with your “snowbot” program.
Oh, thank God. The temperature is finally above freezing tomorrow.

Honey....  the neighbors are here!
I listed our old fridge online, and now my computer's frozen.
Calvin's back.
Parson Brown, quantity said 100 +/-, I hit enter, so...
I don’t think they’re happy about the carrot cake...
Looking up "Carrot Cake with Frosting" recipes.
Lessons learned from last year.......the hats and scarves make good nests for all the rabbits.
Hats and scarves are great but our snowballs are freezing
Perhaps I shouldn’t have called global warming a hoax.
I can't judge any of you. I have no malice against you and no ribbons for you. But I think that it is high time that you all start looking at yourselves, and judging the lie that you live in.”
I think the snowmen have something to say about climate change.
You say you feel as if you're always being watched.
Are you starting to feel a little guilty about turning the heat up?
Edgar, what did you put in the egg nog this year.
My mother wants grandkids
Well it says here that they’re attracted to knitting.
It says here, Dorothy, “ as the Arab Spring revolution fizzled out, others have taken up the cause”
You see, this is what I've been talking about Dear. Finally the climate change agitators have insidiously riled  up those most vulnerable to any small change in temperature.
They’re protesting climate change - what’s the big hurry!
Tell them that whatever they’re selling, we don’t want it.
Apparently, there is a Santa Claus.
Oh dear, how do we tell them that the fashion trend this season is vintage Frosty The Snowman?
The old top hat I found is up on Facebook Marketplace - let's hope there's some magic in it!
Waldo who?
I’ll order by the yard then?
It says "Cloudy with a chance of snowman apocalypse".
Relax. Abominable Snowmen don't really exist.
If no corncob pipe, there is no Frosty the Snowman here.
I just ordered free instant delivery carrots
Winter is coming! Winter is coming!
Excuse me, do you have a moment to tell us what happened at the end of Frozen II?
Fashionistas.
Greta has everyone marching.
Like I told you last year, Charles. Invite one and they’ll all come begging for a spot.
I am ordering a snowman but the 'submit' button doesn't seem to be working.
I was joking about the warm front.
Dwight decided that scaring Jim at the office wasn't enough.
Told you the scarf thing was a bad idea........
They appear very nosy!
Can you check the salary offer in your ad for this year's snowman?
Just look will you, there is a hoard of snowman zombies!
I told you, they breed like rabbits
Fine, but where's Waldo?
Ignore them. They'll be gone come March.
Instant message: is anyone else seeing zombie Frosty the Snowman?”
Don't worry, I'm ordered more yarn now.
Uh oh....It says here that three or more snowmen are called a "murder."
Good news honey. I bet on the over this year!
The co-op board is here again.
No, I said "I was going to snow you with carrots!"
Just got an email that our neighbor's ML project to 'increase holiday spirit' has had some unintended consequences.
According to Google, “Hi there Snowflake”
 was not the best greeting to use.
Dear, the “Frosty” try-outs are still waiting!
I don't care how much they stare, I will not give them my Disney + log in.
Don't panic, Alice. I'm Googling rabid, zombie snowmen right now.
They do look scary, but I’m hoping they all have a happy jolly soul like Frosty.
two eyes made out of coal yes, but the resemblance ends there...
Is 'corncob' one word?
I told you the climate change protestors were going to take things to a new level but you didn't listen
Okay . . . bumping that up to 500 corncob pipes.
They want to talk to you about your lack of holiday spirit
Those snowmen are really warming up to us... *exhales* Greta Thunberg was right!!!
I suppose we could watch revenge of the snowmen again, it's just that it's on every year.
I told you feeding that stray was a bad idea.
They just want to see you knit another snowman cap.
Likely just a colding error.
How do you feel about mini-blinds?
If I order in the next 20 minutes, more yarn can be here in 2 hours.
I think you're going to have to start knitting faster because they're here now.
I think you’d better knit faster.
Frosty is back but this time with all his friends!
My stocking caps have gone viral.
Sometimes I really hate that kid.
Pay no attention, dear, it's just another Climate Warming protest.
I keep pasting the word "snowman,"  but nothing happens.
Interesting article here linking global warming and the zombie apocalypse.
The number of climate change refugees is getting out of control.
If it makes you feel any better, they'll all be gone in a few months.
I'm writing how much "Chrissy  just loves to make a good Snowman" on my Facebook update

It looks like the Burl Ives appreciation society is here.
This how-to video will be a hit!
Honey, I suggest you delete your latest post in which you claim to be the coolest.
How's about some hash brownies this Christmas?

Honey, maybe it’s time we gave up our bourgeois routines and  go outside to get play.
Don't worry, they'll melt in a few weeks."
These climate change protests are getting out of hand.
So Rosemary, you’re really going to name the baby Frosty.
How many times do I have to tell you? If you give them a stitch...
For some reason Prime is out of carrots.

When the sun goes down you cannot play 
Come on inside before you melt away♫
Don't worry, I installed carrot-proof windows.
I told you what would happen if you kept knitting after midnight.
No, dear, the dish was fine without carrots.
Honey, is it me or has Black Friday changed dramatically from what it used to be?
Oh, I forgot to tell you I invited some vegan friends for dessert.
I think I only have two hats and three scarves to go....
I say we wait until spring.
Hun put on something about climate change.
I told you not to eat that snowcone.
Try not to make eye contact and maybe they'll go away.
The grass is not always greener.
I see dead people.

Some of these new SUVs look pretty good but something's telling me we should be going electric.
Frosty and his friends are concerned about that application for online ordainment.
How old were you when you developed this fear of Frosty?
Yeah dad, that's the woman who took some of my snow!
Sweety, did you tweet that you had corn cob pipes For sale again?
Check the freezer. It must have sent out another malfunction alert.
You know Halloween is late this year
Please at least close the curtains until they melt.
Just draw the curtains
Relax. The day we bought this thing, I taped over the camera.
It's snowing Snowmen outside.
Honey, the carolers are here again.
I told you we shouldn't have moved to Syracuse.
I told you it was a bad idea to feed the snowman.
I’m gonna need a bigger ball of wool
Harry ... I really think they want to come in.  Could it possibly be .. too cold out there?
So many caps and scarves.. so little time .
They're out there demanding their pipes!
This is the only place you can get carrots in wintertime
Turns out the group term IS a “flock” of snowmen. Best go give Terry those ten bucks.
Don’t worry.  Their Snowman Apocalypse will end as soon as the temperature goes up.
Apparently spellcheck altered my column on SHOWMAN OF THE YEAR nominations but what’s the worst that could happen?
Is there any reason it shouldn't rain in June?
50 snowmen? -- That kid'll do anything to avoid doing homework!
They must be mad we didn't play let it snow
It looks Frosty outside.
I told you using the magic yarn was a bad idea
Why does everyone feel like they need an audience?
I’m not sure, but I have a feeling it has something to do with my PhD dissertation “The Psychological and Sociological Effects of Global Warming on Frosty The Snowman.”
For some reason I’m craving a shave ice.
Oh, and can you knit scarves for his friends too?
I told you Amazon would be cheaper.
Christ Carl! Those Canadian refugees give me the creeps.
Do you think they want something?
Hang on guys. He is about to find out whether global warming is true.
Seriously dear, there's one who looks just like the lady with those funny little dogs.

According to Facebook, honey, this is what happens when Climate change and “The Walking Dead” have a baby.
Remind me to put carrots on my shopping list
Honey, it`s the snowman global warming activist. Don`t look at them honey maybe they will melt away.
What were you saying about the war on Christmas, honey?
They're filming a remake of "the Birds" but with snowmen
As I sit here typing my final thoughts I can see them encroaching upon our last bastion of heat. Soon the furnace will fail and we will be overtaken. All that is left to say is Frosty was not a jolly happy soul.
That neighbor kid with the stuffed tiger has been busy.
... and then Waldo hid amongst the snowmen...
You still thinking about having all my hockey buddies here on Christmas ?
No it's a mob of kangaroos,I'll goggle it but I believe it's a celebration of snowmen
If we can just hold them off until the spring thaw, we should emerge from this in good shape.
They sure do love watching FROSTY THE SNOWMAN every year.
You better knit faster.
Snow Pinocchios
It says here, they're not dangerous, they're just looking for newly knitted caps."

Now if I can just bring them to life....!
#DontGetFrosted has been trending all day.
Darling, just look at all those carrots!
You know as well as I that we cannot invite them in.
Maybe they would enjoy leg warmers?
It’s getting pretty frosty outside.

Couch Potatoes, why don't you guys come out and play with us???
Honey,you shouldn't put your home address on your shopify account.
...and the curtains don't match the mittens.
Ignore them,it's gonna be 50 degrees and sunny tomorrow.
They’re protesting snow globes. Turn about is fair play.
Cold hands, cold hearts
Just ignore them. In a month or two they disappear
Well, I guess you should start knitting faster.
This is weird. My Jack Frost Facebook page suddenly has a ton of friend requests.
Ralph, you know your holiday eggnog...well what is the 'nog' made of?
Just got an email.. they want to know if you can knit any faster, and are suggesting the long-tail cast on technique..
I may have muttered something about climate change
Honey, have you given any more thought to what you're gonna' do with all the extra yarn you've been buying?"
It says here the cold snap is what brings them around, but they'll be gone by Spring.
They're all snowMEN, darling. Why are they all staring at me?"
So you say you want to build a snowman.
I told you global warming was a hoax.
Of course I still believe we can't have enough cold frostys at the party.  Why do you ask?
It says here that, due to global warming, they started to migrate and we are in their path going north."  Michael Sivak, Ann Arbor, M
Those "climate change isn't real" people have gotten out of hand.
I never dreamed these guys experienced such peer pressure!!
That's what we get for living in an old country for snowmen.
Darn it, they found the root cellar!
Flesh! We require Christmas flesh!
No, it's not The Iceman Cometh...it's The Icemen Cometh.
Last time I let them in there was water everywhere. So no, they can't come in to warm up.
I told you climate change is real!
Sad...they want to sing Christmas carols, but they have no mouths.
Frosty, you gotta have patience...I really do get down to the 'knitty-gritty'.
They don't understand about self-preservation, do they?
Ignore them. They’re just being nosey.
Just ignore them honey, next winter they'll be gone.
I’d love to know WHERE they get their carrots, and who uses coal anymore?
It’s Triple glazing Dear, and besides, 
I’ve invested us in carrot futures.
Oh honey, look; The Holiday Spirit is summoning us.
The WiFi  is down again. It’s going to be a cold night.
Remember the snotty-nosed, carrot-topped people you belittled all those years?
It was the only way I could get carrots delivered.
I hate that some people have to work on Christmas.
I know it creeps you out, but to get top dollar for your house you have to show people there's a lot of interest in the property.
Nothing to see here.
Honey, we need to pick up more carrots.
Well let us in, it's cold outside
Looks like it finally stopped snowing hon.
I don’t remember this scene from Frozen...
It's sunny tomorrow, so we just have hold them off for one night.
Must be Christmas!

Your friends are back to play so please get off your laptop now !
Ignore them Betsy, they'll be liquid in a month.

The floor is essentially tile
It’s going to be 33° tomorrow.
Don't let them in. We just drained the water from last year.
AAAAAH A million snowmen!!!
Well you know, Tabatha, they're just afraid of you as you are of them.
*snowman voice* "no we're not he he he"
also trump is like snow ffffffhahahahahahahaha
Honey, how many snowmen did you order on Amazon?
Think of them as water damage with accessories.
Baby, if you doubt it's cold outside, look out the window!  Then hide our carrots!
Do you think we should invite them in?
Yes, dear, I will take care of the snowmen in a minute.
Snowmen don't feel the cold, you know.
Couldn't we just let them in, Bill?  The weather outside is frightful.
I foresee a carrot shortage Charlie.
The old silk hat made them dance around but the knitted ones they just hang around.
And I specifically said « dress casual »
The word must've gotten out about the new freezer.
We can wait this out until spring, or just start inviting them in for coffee.
Ignore them honey they just want a snow job
Is there a carrot surplus? Seems like the snowmen are getting nosier.
They will look a lot less threatening once it rains
This impeachment has certainly organized those snowflakes.
Seriously, are you ordering more of these? I heard Amazon ran out of snow!
Did you see the special Penn and Teller have on old top hats?
I told you this would happen, Martha. Now every one of them wants and old silk hat.
This neighborhood has a real issue with warm blooded couples.
I told you Frosty was a bad idea.
Happy 267th day of Christmas, dear.
Tell them it's knitting room only.
George, shall we take care of these climate migrants?
Is it still  Halloween?
No worries. 
I promised they could watch Frosty the Snowman at 7.
Honey? How about I make that Irish stew we love tomorrow. You know, the one with tons of carrots.
Well, this is what happens when you leave out Campbell’s for just one of them.
You're looking at my new holiday painting.
Wow!  I didn't realize how much climate change has already affected this area.
I thought we said we weren’t ordering from Amazon this year.
It really freaks them out when I boil water.
No way they’re all just neighborhood kids looking for chicken noodle soup
Says here the grid's down, the infrastructure's collapsed, the Fed's shuttered, and the city has assumed control of our snowblowers.
Tell them the website says "flashmob tonight in the meadow" not "at the Meadows' ."
Whoa! It's looking pretty Frosty out there tonight.
Have I had too much coffee, or do they look like they want to be invited in--and aren't going to take "no" for an answer?
They are saying they're too cold and would like to  melt a bit  with us.
They’re here for the gang bang
You see an invading horde, I see carrot soup and free hats and scarves.
What exactly made you think of the Where's Waldo children's book?
Relax, they’re probably just after their corncob vape pens.
It's just global warming.
Honey, I think they noticed the last batch was ordered off Amazon.
I love our video window but I should have paid for the premium  view catalog.
Next time, break the adderall in half.
Honey, now the weather app says 100% chance of snow...man!
What do you think they want?
I  don't know why I bother.  I never win The New Yorker caption contest.
Did you hear anything about Halloween and Christmas being rescheduled into one holiday this year?
Help! We are melting - maybe you will get colder ?!
Can you believe it?  Amazon Prime sells snowmen.
The hell with your Reach Out And Hug A Snowman idea.  I'm knitting as fast as I can, so maybe some of the buggers don't get hats this year - get over it.
Knitting faster just encourages them, dear.
we hear you knockin'
an' ya melt
come in .......
You are our hero Greta!
'Make a big pot of honey glazed carrots,' she said. 'Whose not going to like that?' she said.
They don't know that this would kill them.
Those unsmiling faces are too much to bear. What do they want?
They predict an early thaw.
They'll be gone by Spring...
Then you can make your carrot soup again...
Vegetable soup for dinner?
The carolers look a bit frosty this year.
That’s funny. When I was  a kid, I wanted to be an elevator operator.
Enjoy your holidays Mr. Musk.
Relax. It's supposed to be 57 tomorrow. Then we can open that winter hat and scarf shop you've always wanted...
It seems the snowmen have learned how much of a whore you are, honey.
He did say he’d be back again some day, but I wasn’t expecting all his neighbors.
It may be warm inside but we are freezing our balls off!
And they say there is no climate change.  When snowmen are taking over
I know it's cold out, but they're just going to make a mess on the rug like last time.
They’re protesting spring.
They've never seen a snow woman in their lives dear. They're lonely and uncertain what they're looking for.
Hey honey, I just remembered that we ran out of carrots...
Are they smiling?
I guess today is that "someday"
Honey, snowmen are an island.
Our horses will love the carrots when the Holidays are over.
I don’t think carrot soup was a good idea.

Look at all of Greta’s friends.  I’m so proud of her!
No, really - we need to turn up the heat.
I'm deleting the post where I ranted about snowflakes now
"They said they emailed, but I can't find it...."
I told you to stop feeding them.
According to the latest report, the farm subsidy for carrot farmers resulted in a bumper crop
I think I solved the mystery of the carrot shortage.
I warned you not to knit 'Warm holiday wishes' onto that scarf.
I think we’ve gone viral.
Little wonder. You've got it freezing inside.
What time did you make that appointment for the furnace to be fixed?
I just did a quick search for 'Irish wool scarves' and they appeared. Either knit more quickly or let me get 500 scarves overnighted. That frozen flash mob ain't playing.
They must work on their anger management problem!
Sometimes real life seems more intriguing than the reel
No, you clicked one million snowmen.
I think the trees are directing them!
Don't worry about them; we're supposed to see highs in the upper 30s tomorrow.
Yes! 'Melted Snowman Zombie Apocalypse' -- that's the high concept, million dollar idea Hollywood has been waiting for."
Honey, did you and little Jimmy actually feed your snowman?
I can't make the numbers work. We need to halt snowman production.

What do you think about carrot ginger soup for supper tomorrow?
The two million seven- hundred eighty three thousand one hundred and twelth floor, please.

Our rooms are large but not as spaciou as you could have imagined, sir
Not all of them have hats and scarves, but they all appear to have carrots.
Honey, I told you we can't afford to take in any more strays.
They're probably just concerned about our carbon footprint.
Stop with the scarfs and hats, a thaw is coming!
The attack of Zombie Snowmen to prevent global warming
We better do something about climate change before the revolution!
Don't worry. Those cold, hard, lifeless eyes can't see a thing.
Turn off cable news, with his carrot skin and weird headgear, they think he is their leader.
It's a living!
I keep trying to tell them if I let them in they’ll melt but they don’t seem to get it.
Make one more scarf and you'll be joining them.
They all came for one of your knitted hats and scarfs.  If you want to get rid of them put on Fox News.  They hate that.
Darling - are you certain that you invited the neighbors for dinner tonight?
This is Miami.  How could there be even ten snow people in the neighbothood?
Better them than solicitors.

It's been a strange Fourth of July all day.
Be patient I’m checking the weather forecast
What? It was too cold in  my faux fur coat...
I'll keep ordering until they deliver one you like.
The global warming word got out and they want a good lawyer.
Help me, global warming. You're my only hope.
Last night, I made the mistake of offering one of them roasting chestnuts from our open fire.
When is the city going to tackle the yardless problem?
Snow days mean kids are at home and .. busy!
I think they're all hoping you'll knit them mittens to go with the hats and scarfs you made.
Did you use Amazon Prime for the snowmen?
Ice tea will be fine. Hot chocolate might give us ulcers.
Did you know there's a music festival in town called Snow-chella?
It says here they're attracted to knitting women and collared cardigan sweaters.
Your probably right. I shouldn't have begun knitting them scarves.
You can stop knitting. I will just buy them scarfs.
I'd love to invite you inside but you'd ruin my rug.
Honey - do you smell carrots ?
Do you see all the snowmen, Dear? No, Janet, now for the last time, put down those knitting needles; I'm calling doctor Murphy.
... and while you’re at it Lester, just scratch the frozen carrot from that order.
"Frosty came back again one day"?
I say we just wait 'em out.
George, the pipes, the corncob PIPES !!
If only they were this productive with their homework.
I have a hankering for a carrot salad tonight.
Honey, is there an elaborate climate change march or should I get my hair dryer?
If Greta is right we will be having carrot soup soon.
Says here to expect hostile weather for the next few days.
I'm thinking carrot stew.
I didn’t know Frosty could multiply.

Honey, get the snowblower, quick.
Wonder why Amazon keeps charging us over and over for the same delivery!
Waiting for the latest style to drop?
Time for a green new deal.
Babe, I know that you said you have a lot of followers, but I don’t think this counts.
Your idea of the seasonal picture window is just not doing it for me.
Hun, just give Billy his tablet back, okay!
So is the weather "frightful"?
To the rooftop parking, thanks.
One too many small steps for man today, sir?
Just so you know, all of the jumping was purely for educational purposes.
‘Earth orbits parking lot. Left my roadster there...’
Did I win?

Look, one of us is going to have to go out and explain that ICE will not send them to the North Pole if they claim to be Arctic migrants.
This always happens when you have the Frosty special on tv.
I bet you didn’t expect so many donations to your scarves Kickstarter, huh?
If you let them in, they will continue to get shorter until they disappear and then we can convert the house into a swimming pool full of floating carrots.
I was wondering what happened to all those carrots I bought the other day.
No need to worry Sweetheart, I found a snowblower with next-day delivery on amazon prime.
I think we should consider carrot futures.
It's amazing how exciting carrot noses are when you're married to a computer addiction.

We really need to address the homeless population
You have a lot of back orders on your Etsy account.
Lachanophobia, a fear of vegetables, and, in your case, a fear of carrots, is not uncommon. We typically find that these issues are a result of some childhood trauma, so let's begin there. Take me back to Winter 1987.
I'm just checking how much underlawn heating costs ...
I told you, if you feed them, they'll just keep coming back for more
Yet you claim to fight climate change.

Did you invite your relatives for dinner?

Dear Santa, the snowmen dont seem to know Christmas is over.
Honey; where did the baby carrots for the stew come from? Cause these pantsless Snowmen are really freaking me out.
PS. Send me your recipe for carrot cake.

Our website is down, so I guess they came here for their caps, scarves and twig mitten orders.
Sorry, guys, it’s no warmer in here!
I can order similar scarves in bulk but they won’t get delivered before next week’s predicted highs in the 40s
They know you are a global warning skeptic.
It's a hologram sent by  The NEW YORKER. I'm telling them great job in making us feel cold; but we can't hear them singing, it's almost as if they have no mouths!
Don’t worry, they’ll melt away by morning.
Fred,
Did you leave the lab door opened again?
Just be glad it’s not the  Night of the Zombies.
Just ignore them:They all want eggnog:
Got those busy little knitting fingers of yours ready to go?

Honey, did you forget to pay for snow removal?
Well, give them a quid and tell them to bug off.
It’s getting really Frosty outside.
Apparently they didn't get the memo, that flash mobs are so passé.
Why couldn't it have been 'do you want to build a snow angel?'

I just found this incredible deal on frozen carrots with free shipping!
Did you just call our cat, Frosty, inside?

Whatever happened to global warming.
I am sorry to inform, but I can't let you all in to get warm!

They don't need sweaters. They're build for winter.

I'm reporting the climate emergency for them!
Did I tell you I found an old silk hat today?
You wouldn't believe how cold it is out there!
Nothing online about snowpeople and 'Jews will not replace us.'

I'm all for Greta Thunberg, but where's her support?
Not in recorded history.
Here's a quote from somebody called Scrooge.  He said it was probably the result of indigestion from an underdone potato.  Warmer for US if we close those drapes in this kind of weather, eh?
If only Amazon would sell real snowmen ...
Just wait for summer and they'll be gone.
You told me your in-laws weren't visiting this year.
There has to be a better way to deliver fresh produce
Maybe you should write about a bunch of snowmen who attack people!
I just tweeted something about snowmen.....
Its not a snowman convention its a "vigil "- there's a big difference in price.
Pay no attention to their demands, we are not switching to organic carrots on my watch.
What in Jack Frost’s name did you just google?
Apparently they all like your knitting board on Pinterest."
Have you switched to cashmere yarn?! The wool is very itchy on our necks.
Did you say carolers or carroters?
I know the sign said not to feed the snowmen but I couldn't help myself.

When are we expecting the Frosty family?
"The weather report shows that there is a slight chance of snow."
Oh yeah that reminds me, get some carrots at the store tomorrow.
Honey, Did you remember to buy carrots at the store?
I'll ask Siri to turn up the thrermostat
Well you were the one who was so worried about global warming.
I count 40 scarves and 25 hats needed. Amazon is our only option..they'll be a pile of coal and carrots waiting for you.
The moon is full and the snow stopped  - looks like a nice night for a walk.
If you’d just turn off the light...
I forgot to mention sweetheart, I invited 500 snowmen here to bang you in every hole.
They come by each year to sing carols
and I invite them in for sno-cones.
.. and when did you first start seeing these snowmen?
76331899.8.1577372385.1577308575.9199fc77-981a-4195-bf98-1
Told you so.
Dear, they aren’t really there. They’re spoofing you.
Whatever you are blogging about global warming is upsetting the snowmen!
Remind me to get more carrots.
It says, "For Zombie Snowmen Just Turn Up The Thermostat."
Honey, I know you love them, but keeping them warm isn't thermodynamically favorable.
I told you it wasn't a good idea to give your address on your Etsy site when it comes to the wool hats you knit.
Honestly darling, these climate refugees no longer know what to do to warm the atmosphere
You bought 10,000 tickets to “The Icemen Cometh?”
Honey, maybe we should move up stairs.
Don't worry.  They'll melt by tomorrow.
They are giving us a Frosty reception.
What color of scarf do you want?
Dude, he's looking the best for your skin color!
Well then knit faster if the others need a scarf too.
So I was thinking someone warm.  The Carribean, maybe. Thoughts?
I know your heart is in the right place, Babe, but trust me -- "warm and cozy" would be wasted on the likes of them.
Keep knitting, he just sent the selfie to his friends. Those are only his relatives.
Keep knitting, furnace repair guy just cancelled.
Did you forget to shovel the walk?
Honey, did you have to use my favorite hat?
That's an awful lot of ice staring at us!
You only need to knit them hats until springtime.
I wouldn't be too concerned. They don't have penises.
Do you think they know we gave them the non organic carrots?
Google says snowmen are the worst.
Give them a hat and the next thing you know they’re asking for mittens. And, forget about your 
cookies over there, blah, blah, blah.
Maybe we can just stick to sledding next snow day.
Wait until they find out that it is no bargain inside here.
It’s a casting call for the GOT comedy sequel.
Sweetie, I'm going to need that sweater back.
So that’s where my scarves ended up.
No wonder you couldn't find carrots at the market!
What did you expect, Katherine? I told you to stop feeding them.
Dear, I think it may be time for you to change your position on global warming
Dear, I think we might want to liquidate our short position on carrots.
Uh, honey, could you help me with the knitting?
I don't know why you're still knitting for them. They just need to accept being cold.
Don't let them back in, Honey. The carpet was soaking wet last time.
Great, now they all want scarves.
INVASION  OF CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS
This story says they have one demand: stop feeding carrots to horses.
Tell them to come inside babe, see how long they can keep up this passive-aggressive schtick.
Honey, what did you to do Frosty?
Keep knitting...I can't expedite delivery for these sale scarves.
Don't worry. It says here that zombie snowmen are vegetarians.
Don't say anything to them or it will just snowball into a big fight.
They want you to start knitting handkerchiefs, apparently their carrots are glazed
Hey Honey,  thanks again for your knitted sweater - it feels so warm and cuddly...
Oh ,I wouldn't worry. It's going to be 54 tomorrow.
Would you like a melting snowman or should they stay 
just to keep their shape?
Hun there are some individuals in our front yard that are concerned about global warming
Draw the drapes, dear.  I am afraid of carrots.
Honey, it's time to call him in again from playing in the snow.
I see why your screen keeps freezing up!
I would delete that last tweet, if I were you. # No More Frosties has gone viral.
How fast can you knit scarves?
Sure, now you show up.
I told him to wear a beanie like everyone else, but he always has to be the one to stand out.
You're not keeping up! I just ordered another 100 scarves on Etsy!
Don't mind them. They're the quintessential example of six degrees of separation, so to speak.
Any idea of how I could diversify my consumer base?
All the scarves and hats and carrots are sold out!
The weather report says, "The icemen cometh."
Honey would you Google snowman apocalypse ?
Tomorrow's forecast is warm and sunny. Why?
It sure looks frosty outside today.
I think we built too many snowmen.
It's Frosty-Con. They think we're a neighborhood pub.
Okay, okay. I'm canceling the multiple orders.
We're booked for the Caribbean Cruise and we can leave Frosty behind!
They're suing us for our excessive use of energy. Ignore them they'll  go away.
Just ignore them and they’ll melt.
Well my dear the snowmen are just my computer.
More carolers?
Don't blame me, I voted for the Canada Wall
It says here a green hat and red scarf.
Honey, do you think this snowblower will disturb the neighborhood?
Looks like there is going to be a shortage of carrots this year.
I hope there’s enough snow left to build a fort.
You're right, the thermostat is set a little too low--they asked if they can come in to cool down.
They’re cold. Knit faster!
Don't worry dear, it says here that because of global warming, they'll be extinct in a few years.
Order another thousand yards of red yarn !
I'm no good at judging the size of crowds Ted, but I'd say there's about seventeen million of them out there.
The downside of curtailing our carbon footprint.
I don’t think we should let the children watch frozen any more!
Don’t look. If you wait, they’ll melt away.
What we need is to find an untapped voting bloc that is fundamentally threatened by Trump.
I’m emailing Frosty. You have knitted SO many hats.
Is that a scarf or a hat that you're working on?
Your scarves are winning Etsy.”
Ignore them--they're just zombies of climate change.
I am getting a mixed response to uploading our carrot soup recipe.
They want you to play, "Where's Frosty?" with them.
It says here they’re harmless but  having matches handy is a good idea.
No, it doesn't say anything about a Frosty apocalypse, why?
Hmm. It seems the internet doesn’t have enough wool.
Hon, the weather lady did forecast a scary winter weekend.
Google says this problem will resolve itself come springtime.
Quick, honey, hide the scarves!
I told you - you have to make enough for the whole class.
Earl, those global warming protesters are back again
You just had to brag about your scarf-making skills, didn't you?
George......did you tell the neighbors about our open house party?
I told you Sue, if you knit it they will come.
Give it a scarf and they' won't go away until they all have one.
Look at all the carrots !
Can't say I didn't warn you, hon. First it's one or two carrots...
When James woke up in the morning, it had already begun to snow.
Tell them I'm looking up the tracking number for their corn cob pipes now.

NORAD says we could be dealing with SnowMen, SnowWomen, SnowTrans, SnowPerson, SnowCis, SnowTwoSpirit SnowGenderQuestioning,SnowPanGender Invasion
I told you not to knit ours a scarf, now all the neighbors' want one too.
That new snow blower attracts way too much attention.
Tom, it's the coldest night of the year! Can't we just let them in?
Honey, you know that virtual online snowman app has put thousands out of a job.
I'm much more concerned about the ones without hats
My mistake was in asking you if you wanted to build a snowman.  You just don't know when to stop.
Global warming. Endangered species. They need a colder environment like our living room.
You’re gonna need a lot more yarn for all those cold carrots, hon.
Hmm... there's nothing on the internet about how to get rid of an army of angry snowmen.
What a silly waste of carrots!
Could it be a protest about my carrot cake?
Amazon has scarves and hats on sale and will deliver by tomorrow.  But what were you thinking when you promised every snowman in the neighborhood a scarf and hat?
No, we're not letting them in.  They'd just melt on the carpet.
Remember me saying — after caps and scarves — that you can't just knit snowball warmers for one...?
A couple hats and scarves and next thing you it's all the scum of our weary city comes a-knocking.
They're demanding that we don't kill Frosty this year.
I don't think they are here because we have heat.
I must have said something about you being a snow queen.
It's really cold out there. Let them in and they'll probably melt with gratitude.
Holidays kind of snuck on me.
I wonder when the snowmen are coming this year.
‘Tis the season to be stalking
If they were  lemmings, there would be no need to be afraid.
Quit complaining, I’m not turning the heat up
It's for their own good.
For some reason we must look too cool for  Global Warming
I am thinking of having roasted carrots for Christmas dinner.
It's climate change. They're asking if they can come in and turn on the air conditioning.
Alice, can you knit faster?
I'd call ICE , but there's a warm spell starting tomorrow.
This Amazon is amazing.
It's because I didn't cry while we watched Frosty, isn't it?
They're worried about climate change as well.
Don't be afraid, global warming will melt their asses!
Another fake news story...Earth invaded by race of snowmen, scheeeesh!
Well at least we'll have plenty of beta-carotene.
Ignore them.  They're just looking for a fight."
I told you not to pick up knitting.
Do not order the snowblower
Oh its that book again and your imagination.
There must be a HVAC place open on Christmas Eve...
That’s fine to invite them in. But make sure they wipe their feet in the mat.
You'd better fetch the garden hose.
Which part of Iceland did you say your family is from?
You know, it says here that this global warming thing is exaggerated. Winter is still winter, isn't it?
The Weather Channel Online is reporting that climate change could bring on a snowman apocalypse.
Your milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.
They want to watch Frosty the Snowman.
I told you dear before we moved here that this might happen.  How many more stocking caps do these idiots expect you to knit?"
Honey, would you  mind turning the heat down?
Snow crowds are forming outside dear. 
Yes , the sooner I book for Hawaii the better
Check to see if there's a warning trend tomorrow.
Oh look, Honey! Amazon one day delivery has arrived!
I had a cold chill like the Mark of Gideon.
Looks like they heard we have the only snow blower in the neighborhood too
Frosty 'did' say he'd be back again someday.
I don’t think it’s important whether the carrots  are organic or not.
Yea, we're cosy in here and your just smelling carrots...
Not the kind of snow squall I had in mind.
You do notice several are without hats.  They request that you knit more.
There must have been some magic in the pom-pom hats they found.
Maybe we need to turn the thermostat up
Think about all the yarn you will have come spring time.
How fast do you think you can knit a few dozen more hats and scarves?
You’d better knit faster. They’re getting cold out there.
Oh yeah, I told Frosty he could stop by with a few friends.
I told you you shouldn't have cooked carrots for dinner.
I thought I cancelled the order.
What did you do with that scarf and hat I knitted for you last year?
My constituents REALLY want Trump impeached and removed. The White House has told us to just ignore them.
Alas! Those “organic” carrot noses for the Community snowmen awakened their curiosity,  my dear.
Ordering more yarn.
Are you watching "The Iceman Cometh?
Honey, it’s snowmaning outside !
Says here the mushrooms should take effect within ninety minutes...
You start out knitting them scarves and hats, and next thing they all want sweaters!
Tell them we ran out of candies.
I told you. If you leave carrots out you’ll attract ever stray on the street.
I told them we could play once I finish my shopping.
If you continue staring at them, they will all melt.
Honey, get the hair dryer ready.
I think they know we didn't buy carbon offsets.
G = “i oing up?
Going out for a walk, Sir?
Are you a visitor of Mr .Dogg?
I’m ready for holiday season!
Daddy, STRANGER DANGER!
It's predicting a 90% chance of snowmen
This 3D printer thing of yours is getting out of control.
Remember the flood we had last year when we let them in.
If you close the curtain, they will stop lining.
I told warned you: you buy all those carrots, there will be consequences.
Don’t worry honey ,global warming is going to kill them sooner than you think.
The weather outside must be frightful.  In here, it's so delightful.
It’s just “The Walking Dead - Snowman Edition.”
Don't worry; it's just cosplay.
Well, you said I couldn't bring them inside...
Why are you sad? This acid is crazy!
The million snowman march? That'll never happen!
Relax, honey, they're attracted by the knitting needles clicking. How many stocking caps have you made, anyway?
Hmmm...Weather report says low of 28 tonight with a slight chance of frost.
They just want to Netflix and chill with us
Whoa, Lori’s Caps & Scarves has gone viral.
Let's go to the Trans-Lux and hiss Roosevelt!
In a relationship like ours, you will need to become accustomed to "them" staring at us.
Honey, you ordered them with hats. I said I preferred no hats !

Carrots, I have plenty of carrots.

"I think they want to know what I'm knitting"
They all think I'm the casting director for "Frozen" and you the costume designer.
Uhh, honey - i think your cousins are here
Do you think they'll melt away if we wait inside long enough?
How can we leave them just for our own enjoyment?
Don't worry honey, they're more scared of us than we are of them
Please don't tell me this is another white nationalist dog-whistle...
I wouldn't worry.  According to the weather, it's supposed to be very frosty tonight.
The sixth sign of the apocalypse has begun; next, global warming!
Sometimes you just wanna stay in.
Have you been making carrot cake again?
Your in the mood now? What made you come around?
Don't let them in.  They'll melt all over the rug.
It seems that your Instagram post about not liking snow has gone viral.
Joe, can you stop building snow men, because I am darn tired of knitting the caps?
All because we didn't let our kids watch "Frosty the Snowman"
I think the real question is: where did I get all those carrots, lumps of coal, winter hats, and scarves?
They want you to knit scarves.
The weather report says that there is a 90% chance of  a snowman apocalypse through the weekend.
Damn snowflakes.

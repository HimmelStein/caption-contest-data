Surprise, surprise. The new manager is a fat white guy with no pants.
I can already tell he won't last.
He's not as bad as the last manager. That one was abominable.
They didn't say who...they just said one of us won't be here in the spring...
It's not you, he's frosty to everyone.
I told him if he can't find his size to just wait a few minutes.
Either the constant staring stops or I'm cranking up the thermostat.
I hear he had a meltdown after the holidays last year
He's the very definition of seasonal help.
If he asks you if you want to see his other carrot, just say no.
I think you misunderstood when I said to hire seasonal help.
He insists it's all water weight.
They set the temperature for just ONE employee while the rest of us freeze to death.
So he calls me into his office and when I get there he's wearing nothing but a scarf and a top hat
I guess the hiring freeze has officially started.
He's fun, sure, but he won't last.
If I wanted a boss with no pants, I'd have stayed in Hollywood.
As seasonal workers go, he is much better than the turkey they hired last month.
Of course they hired another white guy.
By two o'clock, he'll be just another 'clean-up in aisle 2'.
He works well, but has serious meltdowns.
He'll be gone by spring.
You don't think it's odd that he's looking at summer clothes?
Well, we asked the agency to send over a temp.
So what if his hands are just sticks, he should still have to fold.
He says he used to know his wife's size, but with global warming...
He’s asking about our ‘No Payment ‘Til Spring’ special.
Don't worry. He won't last long.
I made him. Now he's telling me how to do my job?
If he spends any more time deciding, he'l actually fit into a Small.
Apparently he was just over in the produce department picking his nose.
At least he doesn't tell me I'm hot.
Wait until you see the Easter sales staff.
One week and he’s store manager--I’m calling white male privilege.
He gives me the chills...
After the holidays last year, he had a total meltdown.
Something tells me this one's not going to be able to take the heat.
Trust me, he's a temp.
I don't care how great an employee he is...if he touches that thermostat one more time, he's outta here.
He won't last a day.
It's freezing in here. Would it kill anyone if we turned up the heat?
Then what bathroom do YOU think he should use?
After the holidays, the seasonal staff will be liquidated.
I betcha he won’t last til spring.
How am I supposed to enforce no shirt no shoes no service when this guy comes into work with no pants.
Just wait. These seasonal workers always melt under pressure.
They only hired him because he's seasonally appropriate and anatomically incapable of sexual harassment
If he starts humming that tune one more time, I'm turning up the thermostat.
His meltdowns are legendary.
Claire says he's just here until the spring liquidation.
If he harasses you, I'll turn up the heat.
They prefer to be called 'snow person'.
At least the elf knew how to work a register.
I give him three months.
Great. Another beloved public figure out with no pants on.
No worries, he won't last.
He’s only a temp.
He's seasonal
I'd date him but I'm really looking for something that will last past February.
I know he's stealing all the buttons, I just cant prove it.
He called ME a snowflake.
It’s so easy to spot the seasonal employees.
You turn up the thermostat; I'll grab the 'Wet Floor" sign.
They said the new guy was a jolly happy soul, but he's been pretty Frosty to me.
Seasonal hire. He won't last a week.
His last boss said he had a meltdown.
If he tries to show me his carrot one more time I’m going to punch him in the snowballs.
All that diversity talk and they go hire another white man.
I just can’t warm up to the new guy
Great. They went outside to fill that position.
I don’t think he’ll last a day.
Whatever happened to 'no shoes, no shirt, no service'?
Says he needs the money to start a slush fund.
Bet you the seasonal hire doesn't last a day.
He says he's here for the liquidation sale.
I'll be surprised if he lasts a week.
He's a temp.
He always disappears just before the spring line arrives.
Well, I refuse to mop up after the seasonal hires.
Yeah, he's a temp. He'll be gone by summer.
Seriously, who wears white after Labor Day?
He asked me out last spring then disappeared.
We figured out who's been turning down the thermostat.
They told me he's diversity hire, but as far as I can tell he's just another white guy.
I've been giving him the cold shoulder, but it just seems to encourage him.
He'll be gone by the spring.
clean-up in aisle three in about ten minutes.
I'm not sure the new guy is going to last.
If it takes him any longer to decide we're going to need a mop
Fake nose.
I think he's Canadian.
Don't worry. He's cool.
Is it me or is the new guy always sweating?
Why does everyone think the new guy is so cool?
He's an 8.
He got really upset when I told him that scarf looks hot.
Just trust me, you don't want to be anywhere near him when he has one of his meltdowns.
If he asks you to laugh and play, don't.
You're right. It would be just as weird if he wore pants.
These seasonal hires never seem to last.
I like our seasonal help, I really do...., but if he says, 'Do you get my drift?' , one more time, I'm going to scream!
It's all water weight.
He wants a Large to wear today, a Medium for tomorrow, and an Extra Small for next week.
These seasonal workers never last.
He says "Frosty" is racist. He prefers Kevin.
Something about him just gives me the chills.
He's asked to stay on after the holidays. Do you want to break it to him, or should I?
Trust me, don't go anywhere near his carrot.
He needs it in a smaller size, should I just adjust the thermostat?
He’s refusing to work the fire sale.
The dude's definitely bi-polar.
The iceman browseth.
I don't think the new guy is going to last long.
Only one man in the whole department, but he gets to set the thermostat?
He just thinks he's so much cooler than everybody!
Let's hope he doesn't have a meltdown.
Seasonal worker.
He insists on looking at the petites - says he'll grow into them.
Keep an eye on our buttons.
He knows nothing about pants.
If he asks me to adjust his carrot one more time, I'm going to HR.
By the time he decides he'll be two sizes smaller.
Someone keeps taking the carrot from my lunch.
If he asks, "do you smell carrots?" one more time...
I hear he's only temporary
He won’t last a week.
Is it just me or does the new guy give you the chills?
He says he needs a smaller size because of global warming.
I had a feeling that he'd be back again some day.
More like BOSSY the snowman.
So that's what they meant by 'hiring freeze'.
He says he's quitting, but just you wait. He'll be back again someday.
I have nothing against seasonal help, but I have seen his kind before and they always melt under pressure.
If he tells me one more time "you need to chill" I'm going to lose it.
I'm so over him...can we turn up the heat?
Is it me, or is the new guy really cool?
He wants a gift for his wife. She's having a meltdown.
If he "accidently" pokes me with that carrot one more time I'm turning up the heat
Don’t worry. He won’t be here long.
Well, he warned us he'd be back again some day.
All I'm saying is that I couldn't show up to work wearing nothing but a hat and scarf.
It's not as bad as last year when they hired the Little Drummer Boy.
I just hope he doesn’t have another melt down.
He told everyone, so now the girls at the makeup counter are calling me “The Snowblower”!
That constant drip - drip - drip is driving me crazy.
He wants to know if our return policy extends into the Spring.
He won't last long
I thought it best that he work in Seasonal.
He's part of the hiring freeze.
He wants to know what an inseam is.
At least the carrot's on his face this time.
What's really odd is he's a climate change denier
Just how am I supposed to measure his inseam.
I'm glad we have a new seasonal employee. The last one was kind of a turkey.
He keeps giving me the cold shoulder
Jolly and happy my ass. But he can literally sell ice to Eskimos.
Why did they assign him to spring wear? That's just cruel.
I think he’s stealing buttons.
"He said he identifies as 'part Oxygen and part Hydrogen'".
He smokes a pipe and doesn't wear pants. It's like working with my grandpa.
Tries on every scarf in the store, leaves them a wet mess, then says, "I'll be back again someday."
I can't believe the balls on that guy.
He keeps returning his purchases for smaller sizes.
He's looking for something for his wife in a size figure 8.
It's your turn to mop up the fitting room
He just stares at me like his eyes are made of coal.
Holiday temps never last long. They can't take the heat.
Until they build that wall with Saskatchewan, nobody's job is safe.
He's abominable.
He seems a bit bi-polar.
I bet the new guy is gone by Spring.
Once things heat up, we'll see what these seasonal employees are made of.
I think it’s a bad idea, too, but he knows how to accessorize.
He doesn't have a snowball's chance.
I don't think he'll make it past the fire sale.
Tell him to keep his twigs to himself, ok?
Trust me, he won't last.
I tried to get to know the new clerk, but he's a little frosty.
Funny. I always thought we'd be replaced by robots.
Every week he comes in asking for a different size.
Are they drip-dry?
All I know is, the buttons on our pants started disappearing after he showed up.
Yeah, he poked me with it, too.
He won't last.
I give the new guy a week. He won't last.
Yeah, nice guy, but I'm not sure he has what it takes to get through the holidays.
We don't have it in large but if we wait a bit I think he'll fit in medium.
For a jolly, happy soul - he's really cold to the customers...
Sure, he can accessorize, but he'll be gone by Spring.
Nothing fits him so I turned the heat up to 86.
Not a chance in hell.
If he tries to grab you, just pull his arms out.
It could be worse. Housewares has the Grinch.
I think with that one, it really IS water weight.
Well, at least they're not replacing us with robots.
His wife left him, so he wants a sweater to end it all.
I learned my lesson last Christmas. Never get too attached to the seasonal help.
He says his assets are frozen now, but they'll be liquid soon.
The new guy keeps messing with the thermostat.
You know he can't pay us, right? His assets are frozen.
Talk about white privilege...
Bet he doesn't last the season.
I hate temps, they always disappear with the first warm day.
He gives me the chills...
They took us literally when we asked for temporary seasonal workers.
Don’t worry, he’s a seasonal employee. He’ll be gone by the end of winter.
If he asks to turn the heat down one more time, I am going to shove that carrot right up his frosty ass!
I just figured out who keeps turning the air conditioning up.
It's hard finding warm bodies to fill positions this time of year.
Well they couldn't put him the shoe department.
He’ll be gone by the liquidation sale.
Please. I know his type. He'll disappear by spring.
Oh, him? He's a seasonal employee.
Management loves his holiday vibe, but I think he'll be water under the bridge by spring.
If there is no such thing as white privilege, how come he doesn't have to wear pants to work?
I don't think the new guy is going to last.
I heard that layoffs were over but new hires would be frozen.
Whatever you do, don't mention the fire sale.
Retail will crush that jolly, happy soul.
If anyone asks, company policy prohibits glacial profiling, but between us...
Man does that new guy have balls.
One: they hired yet another white guy. Two: he never wears pants.
He doesn't even exercise; it just melts right off
He comes in once a year and always buys the same outfit.
So Legal came by ,apparently it's 'Frosty The Snow Person'..from now on on!
I always knew he'd be back again, someday.
Let's see how jolly happy his soul is when we roll out the new summer collection...
31 degrees inside is not a reasonable accommodation.
Did we actually agree on a hiring freeze?
Abominable taste.
He thinks he's so cool.
The new guy won't last long.
He marked them down below zero.
... and we need one size 29 triple Z shoe.
This is his first day back after his meltdown on Black Friday
Well, I guess they weren't kidding about the hiring freeze...
The smile is friendly, but the eyes are cold.
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat I found, because when I placed it on his head, he began to mark things down.
Hey, sometimes a carrot is just a carrot.
I knew he was a creep when he asked if I wanted to see his icicle.
Sell it to him quick before he changes sizes.
He asked us to join him for a cold one after work.
Giving him the cold shoulder doesn't seem to be working.
Does he know he's only temporary?
Don't worry -- he won't last the season.
Suddenly it's insensitive to bring carrots to work?
Well, I just think snowperson sounds ridiculous.
The seasonal help always think they're going to last longer than they do.
Apparently they've lifted the hiring freeze.
Well, he did say he'd be back again some day.
Direct him to the trouser area without making eye contact.
I hate seasonal hires. Last year's kept asking me to sit on his lap.
Only accept cash from him, no credit, his assets are frozen!
He keeps telling me that later on we'll conspire? I'm reporting him to HR.
It's just not fair, in the spring the pounds just melt off of him.
Well, he was an extra large fifteen minutes ago.
He’ll never last.
Once you get to know him, he's totally chill.
Let's just hope this one doesn't have a meltdown like the last one.
Sure, he dresses nice but he's a little chilly to the customers.
He was hitting on me. Do we sell blow dryers?
He’s a seasonal employee; I don’t think he’ll last long.
It's part of the diversity program
He won't last until Christmas.
I swear to God if he tells me I should smile more again I'm turning up the thermostat.
He's the new seasonal hire They said he would be gone by Spring
The inappropriate comments I can handle, I just wish he’d wear pants.
OMG, he is so last winter.
Is it inappropriate to wish him warm wishes this holiday season?
Is our pay really 79 cents for each dollar he gets?
Ugh... I had a feeling he'd be back again someday.
Snowbots are taking our jobs. We need to build a firewall.
The mall Santa got him this gig.
I’m just sick of mopping-up after these seasonal hires.
He says he's a large for the next hour.
If he says “thumpety thump thump” one more time when I walk by, I’m smacking him.
You'd think he'd be looking for pants.
His father worked here, too. Then one day last March he just didn't show up.
You would think, in the current culture, that the holiday help would have to wear pants.
He put the name Parson Brown on his application.
If he asks for another discount, I swear I'm going to turn up the thermostat.
He annoys me too, but he’ll be gone in a few weeks.
It's time to turn up the heat on the new guy
Would it kill him to take off the top hat?
Don't waste your time. He'll be gone by spring.
This guy is giving me the chills.
He’s a seasonal worker
Let's see if he makes it to the spring collection.
Sorry, it's my fault. I told him 'You can do the job when you're in town.'
We are going to need a mop on aisle 5
Do not mention next week's fire sale.
Check the permanent address on the credit card.
I bet he'll be gone by spring.
I heard there's a hiring freeze on seasonal employees.
What's abominable is that scarf.
Swimsuit season should be interesting.
Wanna bet who's going to win December Employee of the Month again this year?
The last time I turned up the heat, he reported me to HR.
Sure, he's cool now, but I bet he melts under pressure.
Not every seasonal temp is that cool.
If he asks me if I want to see his "snow balls" one more time, I'm calling H.R?
No, don't think so. The store detective is disguised as Santa.
He's been giving me the cold shoulder all day.
He's a seasonal hire.
He insists he’ll be able to fit in those smaller sizes as early as next week.
I miss the elves.
This is not what I meant by a more diverse workplace.
I feel for him, too. They didn't need him in the Holiday window display anymore, but he doesn't know a thing about women's clothing.
You should have seen the puddle he left last year.
He's been giving me the cold shoulder all day.
I told him he had a snowball's chance in hell of finding pants that fit
I just can't believe HE is the diversity hire.
Remember the turkey we hired last month?
He won't last more than a day.
I don't care if he's "seasonal" - I'm going to HR unless he puts on some pants.
He said, "Are you Married?" And I said "No Man!" Can you believe the balls on this seasonal help?
If he touches the thermostat one more time, I’m going to wipe that smile off his face.
Say no when he offers to show you his snow balls.
Management sure is taking this hiring freeze seriously
He warned us he'd be back one day.
I'm filing a report with HR, as soon as I figure out which one of the guys texted me a photo of their carrot.
He’ll never last.
I would ask him to work late, but he'll have a meltdown.
I hear there's a Claus in his contract.
His pants are off again. I'm calling H.R.
Look it's the new temp. I don't think he'll last until Spring.
I doubt he'll last 3 months.
It's his break time. He wants to know where he can go to chill out.
He gives all the customers the cold shoulder
He's just working while his assets are frozen
He says he can only work until spring
Don't worry, he won't last through spring.
And he refuses to sell pants.
Don't worry, he's just temporary.
I’m still not happy about this hiring freeze.
Don’t bother making friends. He’s a seasonal.
He’s obsessed with climate change
Can't he be a jolly happy soul with pants?
Put him charge of the pants department. Maybe he'll get the hint.
Susan, do we have a dressing room with a drain?
Watch, he'll be gone by spring.
They come, they work the holidays, and then you never see’em again.
The department manager wants to prove that global warming is a non-issue.
He thinks they'll fit better in a couple of hours.
You think that’s his real carrot?
Boss or no boss, if he hits on me again we'll be featuring complimentary snow cones.
Diversity? They just hired another damned white guy.
Last year I dated him and then he just vanished.
I went out with him once, and things just kind of started snowballing.
He flashes that carrot at me one more time, I'm calling HR.
All he talks about is global warming.
I know he looks broke, but he's got a secret slush fund.
I'd fuck him.
Looks innocent now, but at the Christmas party he had his twigs all over me.
And then play it cool like, "What puddle? What carrot?"
All I know is there was a puddle under the suit rack and Frosty the Sales Associate was standing there with that grin of his.
Something tells me the new guy won't last the day.
I've seen his type before. As soon as it warms up he'll be gone.
He says I’m not cool enough for him.
'Find some temps with no visible tattoos,' they said.
No, I don’t think the new guy is hot.
This is their idea of diversity an cold white male?
Here's a guy who comes to work every day wearing nothing but a hat and a scarf and no one says a word.
I'm this close to lighting a fire under his ass.
He's wondering if the scarf makes him look fat.
20 bucks says he has a complete meltdown by Christmas Eve.
He's in denial - he thinks he's a medium
What do we have that flatters a pear-shaped figure?
Trust me; he'll be gone by spring.
These seasonal employees never last very long.
He just asked me out for a Sno Cone.
I give him a week, tops.
His sales pitch is very carrot and stick.
He sent me a picture of his other carrot!
Every year the holiday hires get flakier and flakier
The new guy won't last long.
I saw him on break, just standing there, with his head in the freezer.
You want to get rid of him politely? Turn up the thermostat.
He wants to look at our fall line. I don't have the heart to break it to him.
Yet I'm the one they call frosty.
I remember when seasonal employee meant college student.
He's a bit frosty, but he warms up once you get to know him.
He's going to ask you to straighten his carrot. Trust me, don't!
Seasonal staff. They're all a bunch of flakes.
He say it's okay if they shrink.
He’s a nice guy but some of his friends are abominable.
If that new guy asks me to adjust his carrot nose one more time, I'm going straight to HR.
The new guy asked what an inseam was.
"He's here to help with the liquidation sale".
He’s taken three corncob pipe breaks and it’s not even lunch yet.
Should we call HR? He's been staring at us for the past 20 minutes.
Sure he’s a jolly, happy soul, but I’m still the one who has to mop up the puddles in the fitting room.
They're calling it a "hiring freeze."
Really? The Burl Ives collection?
I solved the mystery of the missing buttons.
The new guy gives me the chills.
You'd think with that figure he'd spend more time eating carrots and less time wearing them
I hope he knows he's temporary.
I told him to do one thing differently and he almost had a meltdown.
Call security. Every year he comes into the store with no pants on looking for the snowblower department.
I don't think he'll last.
He says he's looking for something with moisture wicking capabilities
Personally, I would never wear white after labor day.
I hear he's the kind of guy that just plays with you for a while and then disappears.
They said he could do the job when he’s in town.
Sure, he's kind of cute, but I never date seasonal help.
Every year the temps always start out so jolly and happy.
Sure, it helps with sales. But I'm freezing.
I don't care if he's tall, I'm not going out with a climate change denier.
I know he's seasonal, but no pants in the work place is bad these days.
If the New Yorker did a cartoon about this, it would suck.
Seasonal employee.
It's the holiday help. Usually they're gone by spring.
And why doesn’t the dress code apply to the seasonal employee?
He thinks everything makes his butt look big.
He must be a secret shopper. I've only ever seen him buy a scarf.
I wouldn't worry. Those seasonal workers never last.
He won't last.
Our liquidation sale will end soon.
How long would we keep our jobs if all we wore was a scarf and a top hat?
It’s the other carrot that is the problem.
How'd the new guy manage to book the entire summer off?
I don't think the new guy is going to last.
That icy stare is making me uncomfortable.
I'll bet you this new guy doesn't make it past Spring.
He's beating us in sales. Can you turn the A/C down a bit?
I guess Mr. White Male Privilege feels entitled to come to work naked.
He just cancelled the spring liquidation sale.
I don't think he's gonna last.
I know it's important to have workplace accommodations, but I wish we could turn the heat up just a bit more.
I heard there was a hiring freeze.
I hate working with these seasonal employees.
You'd better call for mop-up on aisle 3
I don't think the new guy's gonna last.
He’s just abominable!
Of course they promoted another White man instead of us.
I'm all for accommodating diversity but keeping the store at 32 degrees is beyond the pale.
Where did you leave the wet floor sign?
He'll be gone by summer
It's creepy, but I really like carrots.
He's seasonal
I thought we couldn't wear hats...
Temp.
Same old story - he says he’ll be thinner by summer
He refuses to go to the Men's Dept., says the sweaters there make his butt look big.
He wants to know about our summer line. What should we tell him?
Puddle on aisle 2.
I was a climate change denier until now.
Don't worry. He won't last long.
I tell you, somebody's taking all the buttons.
I wish his wardrobe was a bit more substantial.
He's not interested in any of our hottest styles.
This hiring freeze has gone too far.
He's concerned about shrinkage.
I wish I could come to work naked.
He's just temporary.
I feel like the new guy's just gonna melt under pressure.
Do you think we should talk to HR? I mean, he’s not even wearing pants today.
Wait a few minutes. He'll be looking for a smaller size.
I don't know why they hired him. He's bound to have a melt down.
He's getting on my nerves. Turn up the heat.
He's just going to make a big mess, and then not buy anything.
They hired *that* guy back? He had a total meltdown last holiday season.
It's not that he's naked, I just can't stand hats.
He's been looking for work ever since the war on Christmas ended.
They lied about the hiring freeze.
Nothing on the rack will fit him for another 30 minutes.
I predict he'll be gone by spring.
Sure, a silk top hat, but he's still a drip.
Sure he's jolly, but he's a mess by the end of the day.
If he leaves a puddle again, you clean it up
Your new hire just leered at me and said, "Thumpity thump thump," and he's not wearing pants.
I think figured out where those buttons went.
I'm getting HR involved. He asked me again if I wanted to see his snow balls.
I don't think the new guy's gonna last long!
This is why we need to secure our northern border.
And they say I’m frosty!
It's only a matter of time until he has a complete meltdown.
I just figured out who keeps turning the thermostat down to 32 degrees.
He’s quiet, but prone to meltdowns.
He won't last through February.
I don't care who he is, he needs to put on some pants.
He keeps asking me if I'd like to see his other carrot.
Don’t worry. He won’t be here long.
I heard he had a meltdown during the staff meeting!
I give him 3 months tops.
He'll fit into that by June, if he's lucky.
Magic hat my ass, he hasn’t sold a damn thing since he started.
Just keep him away from the suede jackets.
These seasonal hires never last.
I keep giving him the cold shoulder, but it turns out he's into that."
I say we turn the heat up on the new guy.
We're going out after work to get slushied.
He's just a seasonal manager. He'll be gone in the Spring.
He's looking for something in charcoal.
He won't last long in this atmosphere.
Don't worry, he'll be gone by spring.
Don't use the ice in the break room.
And I thought robots were going to replace us.
He's going to be worthless with the Spring Collection.
He just winked at me and said: "Not all the magic is under the old black hat, if you know what I mean."
Nobody told him that he’s just a seasonal employee.
I didn't know this is what they meant by hiring Freeze.
Right now I'd give anything for a blow torch.
It's not the magic hat I'm worried about.
It's okay, they're drip-dry
Now that Big Oil’s scheduled to start drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge they’ve been moving down here in droves.
Think he knows his days here are numbered?
He's friendly enough with the customers, but when it comes to folding clothes he's abominable.
Stop selling those magical hats.
The new guy seems a little cold.
Surprise, surprise, they hired another white guy.
The new guy? A little frosty, don't you think?
I better go help him before he has a total meltdown.
He doesn’t always keep that carrot on his face, you know.
It's so sexist! The manager would be all over any woman who wore just a just a hat and a scarf.
He's a temp, but he says he'll be back again some day.
So sad, the new clerk is a global warming denier.
He flashed his carrot at me.
Either he puts on some trousers, or I’m talking to H.R.
I don't understand why he's asking about our summer line.
Is it cold in here or is it just me?
Be polite. we can't afford another meltdown.
Styrofoam gave him a new lease on life.
Trust me, he won't last.
He's a good employee but sometimes he just disappears.
Don't ask him to work next summer -- he'll have a meltdown.
I sure hope the new hire makes it through Black Friday without a complete meltdown!
Every Christmas he comes in to buy a sweater for his wife, we never have her size, and then he has a huge meltdown.
They may not fit now, but eventually he'll melt into them.
Yeah, the new guy sells a lot of scarves but I doubt that he'll last here till Spring.
I told him, when he shrinks it will fit.
New guy seem a little cold to you?
I get that we needed seasonal help, but the next time he pokes me with his carrot, I'm calling HR.
He's not going to last.
Did you turn down the thermostat?
Another white male consultant.
The new guy keeps fiddling with the thermostat.
He gives me the shivers.
You can tell he's a seasonal amateur...NOBODY pairs a plaid scarf with vegetables anymore.
First time someone wants something that WILL shrink.
He's really good at using the carrot and stick method with customers.
We'll have to replace him in a few hours.
I can't stand the new guy. Let's turn up the heat.
He's an XXL/XL/L/Medium/Small
Welcome to the cold day in hell.
We've run out of wet-floor signs again.
He's just a seasonal shopper.
He won't last long
Customers are complaining that he’s Frosty
I don't care what he says about his little dinosaur arms... he should have to fold sweaters like everyone else.
He'd better be a seasonal hire.
Unfortunately, his insistence on a first date became stronger after I gave him the cold shoulder.
Is it just me, or is Macy's new supervisor real frosty this year?
It's hard to warm up to seasonal help.
Sure. He's great with customers, but I doubt he'll make it through spring.
Turns out Frosty over there has a complete melt down if he has to help fold clothes.
He said, "Are you married"? I said "Yeah, man." But that wasn't the end of it.
He’s the only man who hasn’t been fired for harassment yet.
He's just seasonal.
Do we have anything in rotund?
It’s always the same. He can only work till spring.
I think we're taking this Diversity in the Workplace a bit too far.
He's been giving me the cold shoulder all week.
He's a white dude. Of course he's paid more than us.
Human resources said the pants issue was all in my head.
I swear, they let the seasonal help get away with anything. He's not even wearing pants!
Magic in that old silk hat, fat chance.
They said he's part of a veteran hiring incentive. He served in the War on Christmas.
His look will be out by Spring.
Don't worry, he won't last through spring.
Amazing, he's had a #1 hit for the last 40 years and he still only shops the sale rack.
All Of These Are Drip - Dry.
It's no easier when I pretend that he is Parson Brown.
He's a hard worker. Too bad he's temporary.
Our jobs are safe, he's just a seasonal hire.
I don’t know why, but he gives me the chills.
Someone needs to tell him his account is frozen.
He seems a lot happier since he stopped smoking that pipe.
The new guy will never make it through the spring.
I declined to laugh and play with him, and he called me a cold-hearted bitch.
Explain again why he makes 20% more than us.
It was marketing's idea to hire him, but he can't fold and he keeps wetting the floor.
Yeah they hired another old white guy for the job.
He got hired right after they told ME that I was too cold to customers.
He asked to take a corncob pipe break.
He's only seasonal.
He's useless. I told him to sort the rack by size and he froze.
Ever since he's placed that old felt hat upon his head, he's begun to play around.
I feel kind of guilty selling clothes to a future puddle.
He's a temp, and he'll probably be gone by April.
I wish he’d put some pants on.
I don't like our new boss either, but I have a feeling he'll be gone by spring.
They hired him off the street.
He said I make him melt. I’m considering going to HR, but I'm not sure they’ll believe me over a white male.
Trust me; he'll be gone by spring.
We dated for a while, but then he totally ghosted me over the summer.
Don’t turn around to look. He never wears pants.
You wait. He won't last six months in this job.
Can you believe this? He told me I could play with his snowballs!
These seasonal employees they hire never seem to last.
If we don't do something about global warming, we won't have any seasonal workers left.
He's always sliding around, staring at me with those black soulless eyes.
Please. I give him until spring.
If this is their idea of holiday temps what's it going to look like around here during groundhogs day
‘I haven’t seen him for a year and now he expects to pick up where we left off.’
Seasonal hire.
L on the top, XXL on the bottom.
Don't let the smile fool you, he is as cold as they come.
Yes, I _know_ he's at least an XL now, but he insists he'll need XS in the near future.
I fucking hate our seasonal workers
Trust me; he won't last. These seasonal hires just can't take the heat.
If he offers to show you his candy cane just say no.
He’s working out great. It’s like he was made for the holiday season.
I don't even bother trying to get to know the seasonal employees.
Seasonal temp.
“He doesn’t need a shirt; he needs pants.
I’d be fired in a heartbeat if I showed up in just a top hat and scarf.
Bet he's gone by March.
His eyes are made of coal. You think he cares that our clothes are made in sweatshops?
You realize he's only seasonal?!
If he asks me about a summer outfit,I’ll tell him the truth.A bucket.
I know he is only a temp, but I’m not sure if he is Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Oh, don't worry about your job, he'll be gone by spring.
And then he walked out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a scarf
I think choosing a spring wardrobe is a bit optimistic, don't you?
Forget it. He'll just give you the cold shoulder.
I thought it would be robots.
I don’t understand why she’s being so cold to us
Did you hear anything about a hiring freeze?
That's what I hear too ... white, male, and cold as ice.
I don't care if he's the manager, it's freezing in here!
I've already called HR. His "pants optional" look is scaring away customer.
I think our diversity program is getting a little out of hand.
Said he needs an XL, a L, M, S, XS, and a Mop and Bucket
Don't go in the backroom with that one. He'll show you his other carrot.
Trust me. He won't last three months here.
This diversity thing is getting out of hand.
Another creepy man in the workplace who "forgot" to put on his pants!
Well, that gives new meaning to hiring freeze.
The new guy can be a bit frosty.
Don’t tell him but I can’t take it anymore. I’m turning on the heat.
His folding ability may be poor, but he sure knows how to accessorize.
He said he just came out as a snowman.
He's literally the whitest manager I've ever had.
He seems nice, but he won't let anyone warm-up to him.
When did we drop the 'need a pulse' requirement for seasonal employees?
What's in that corn cob pipe is what I'd like to know.
Keep him away from clothes that need dry cleaning.
The new guy's not gonna last five minutes in here.
The new guy gives me the chills.
Look who's wearing white after Labor Day.
I give the new guy three months, tops.
I doubt he’ll last till Christmas.
I had to go to human resources about the corn cob pipe.
There’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that anything here will fit.
In an hour he'll be in the children's department.
These seasonal clerks usually don't last a day.
You know, he's just a seasonal worker.
Yeah, he’s been a little frosty lately.
This new temp won't last long.
Do we have anything in a 46 Round?
Him? He's one of our new seasonal workers.
What do you get for someone who's going to melt?
The new guy has been giving me the cold shoulder all day.
I'm trying to be friendly, but he's just so cold.
Seasonal employees are the worst.
Did they really need to get outside help?
That creep gives me the chills.
Oh God...another drip.
He wants to know if they come in round.
Don't do it, Janice. Right now it's fun, but come March he'll stop responding to any of your texts.
Yes, he's cold, but strangely irresistible.
I'm betting he won't last through Spring.
" He wants something to make himself look cool ".
It's so sad when seasonal help thinks they have a shot at a permanent position.
I'm pretty sure he'll be gone by Spring.
He's just a seasonal hire. He'll be gone by the middle of March.
Forget the carrot, he has no nose for fashion.
I give him until March, tops.
I'll distract him. You raise the thermostat.
The new guy is such a flake!
I'd heard our new coworker was a jolly happy soul, but I find him a bit frosty.
The seasonal workers always take it too far.
It’s hard to know what’s real anymore.
Can we go one day without a meltdown?
He says he's looking for Spanx....in white...
He fired Nancy for touching the thermostat...
He's just like any other boss I've had - cold hearted and inappropriately dressed.
Keep him away from the suede.
Just being around him gives me chills.
I asked if I could help him, but he gave me the cold shoulder
He says he needs a 36 jacket and 62-26 pants.
He's invited us to chill after work.
Call HR and tell them the new guy isn't wearing any pants.
This is a huge step up for him. He lived on random front lawns 24/7 up until now.
I don't know about you, but I think he's really cool.
He's the only guy in the store that hasn't harassed me
He says she's a small, medium, and large.
He said he’s not shopping for pants
You told me to get some seasonal help.
At least his carrot isn't pierced.
If he tells me to work overtime I'm turning off the AC.
Pfff. They say inclusion, I say another white male.
don't worry about him, he won't last the day
Diversity is one thing, but this is ridiculous.
White privilege.
He's got the best headset and doesn't even have ears.
Has he tried showing you his other carrot yet?
I have a feeling he won’t last.
He's not sure of his size. Says it changes according to the weather.
I’ll bet that new guy doesn’t last till spring.
I give him two weeks before he has a meltdown.
He's a great holiday temp, and he dances pretty good for a white guy.
I told him. No shirt, no shoes, no service.
He's a great employee, but he'll be leaving us in March.
I'm like, so over him. Spring can't come soon enough.
So much for the president’s promise to get rid of undocumented workers.
Great! This is two weeks in a row where I go to enter my caption around 11:45p and you have next week's contest already up. Thanks a lot! WTF?!
He should be shopping at Until March, not Forever 21.
If that carrot gets any longer, I'm calling HR.
You hired him for his sales experience? You do realize what he meant when he said he's mastered cold calling, right?
I figure I'll have a better shot at manager after our spring liquidation sale.
Nobody sells more wool scarves.
I found a corn-cob pipe in the breakroom.
He got the job because the boss made him, but he won't last.
I dunno, Frosty the Salesman just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
We’re trying to attract a cooler crowd.
I mean, who brings their lunch on their face?
All I know is our scarf sales are up, and out carrot sales are through the roof.
I swear, ever since he started I find chunks of coal in the lingerie bins......
Rumor is this one works undercover for ICE.
I know he's only seasonal help, but seriously, there is a dress code.
He’s the only guy who passed all the new background checks
Don't worry about the new manager. He'll be gone by spring.
Do we make a size 36 round?
I wish that he’d put on some pants and cover his snowballs.
The last time someone touched the thermostat, he filed a worker's comp claim.
It’s only a matter of time till the new guy has a melt down.
Oh great, they hired another creepy white guy.
Has anyone told him about Climate Change?
The new guy is a TOTAL drip.
I don't care if he get's the employee discount, do NOT let him try anything on !
Apparently we’re in a hiring freeze.
It's the Miami store. He's never going to last.
I bet you $100 the new seasonal worker doesn't last until Spring.
His sales have gone through the roof since he dropped the corn cob pipe and the button nose.
He's temporary.
Look who's calling who frosty.
This customer keeps insisting he's a size 8.
He's the new temp.
There's something about the new guy; I don't think he'll last.
Five bucks says the new guy doesn't last 'til April.
He got a little frosty when I suggested a larger size.
He says he's sick of hand-me-downs.
Festive, sure, but what good would he be chasing a shoplifter?
Trust me--he only wants to stick his nose in your business.
He won't listen to me. Keeps saying I don't know Jack.
He supposedly cares about climate change, but he has two eyes made out of coal.
The new guy looks a little wet behind the ears.
I'm sick of his carrot-and-stick approach.
He's definitely seasonal.
He's just temporary.
Don't worry. He's just a temp. He'll be gone by spring.
You don't have to deal with him for long. He's only seasonal.
Maybe if we just keep talking, he'll disappear.
Maybe we should steer him away from the Spring collection.
I've been receiving complaints about customers trying on "wet clothes."
He'll be gone by spring.
If we can get him to wait a few hours, this sweater will fit him
''Have maintenance send up a squeegee.''
Don't look! Mall security.
The new guy is kind of a drip
I know what you’re thinking... but he makes me feel joyful and triumphant.
What do we have that goes with carrot?
Our jobs are safe; he disappears in March.
Should I show him the Spring collection?
Yeah, he's a new hire but he's only seasonal.
Go easy on the new guy, he doesn't take the heat well.
This diversity program is getting out of hand.
Yeah, yeah, they all say he's a "jolly, happy soul," -- frankly, he leaves me cold.
He is smiling now but always has a meltdown near the end of his shift.
I don't think it's him. He has a button not a carrot.
I don't care if he doesn't have eyelids. I don't like the way he is looking at us.
From window dressing to Assistant Manager in under three weeks... That kid is magic.
He wants one that does shrink.
Don’t look now but the seasonal temp “forgot” his pants again
He says he'll be into XXS by spring.
I suggested he look at pants first.
Don't get too attached. He's a seasonal hire.
If it doesn't fit, he says he just stands in the sun.
Oh, just ignore him, Becky. He's only seasonal.
Tell him 'No credit! Cold hard cash, only'
He gave me the cold shoulder.
I told him, again, even seasonal employees must wear pants.
Hey, if he can tag merchandise, I don't care if he drips.
I hate how my boss is always a white male.
Seasonal hire . . . .
At least he wears clothes, not like those damn penguins we had last year.
The new guy? I give him till spring.
Check out the hat. His taste is abominable.
They hired him during the Sidewalk Sale, but I don't think he'll last long.
I could care less which bathroom someone uses, I just can't stand the trail of puddles
What do we do if he wants to try one on?
Seasonal help. Won’t last long.
He's looking for something in drip-dry.
never an outfit, only accessories
I mean, he's a jolly happy soul and all, but he's got zero eye for fashion.
He wants to know if you have size roly-poly .
If you can believe it, his name is Rudolph.
I don't think that new guy is gonna last.
Jolly happy soul or not--he calls me 'hot' one more time I'm going to HR.
He’ll have a total meltdown if you even mention the dress code.
Yeah, fashion is easy when you're ALL water weight
What exactly does he need a scarf for? Classic case of over-accessorizing.
"Security cameras tell a different story regarding his silk hat that he found".
He won't last through Christmas
Don’t fire him just yet. First turn up the heat.
I told him he has to wear clothes, even if he is a celebrity.
I think they've taken this 'seasonal help' thing a little too far.
I find the new floor manager to be quite cold.
The new guy is abominable.
I've heard of seasonal workers, but this is ridiculous.
Seasonal workers over the holidays are the worst. They always melt under pressure.
He says he can never find pants that fit.
That's one cold customer.
He asked me if we have any jackets with coal buttons.
That new guy thinks he's soo cool.
I never got snowmen. Like, just what we need–another white guy, standing there, doing nothing.
I refuse to call him 'snowmanager.'
If he buys the jacket and pants it will change the whole song.
I mean, would it kill him to turn on the heat once in a while?
He's great at selling scarfs.
Don't worry---he'll only last a few weeks.
Some customers find him a little cold, but that's just his nature.
His size issues? Mostly water weight.
The new guy has been a little cold with customers.
He wanted to know f we had any of the drip-dry shirts in XL?
I swear, the minute the sun comes out these seasonal workers seem to disappear.
Yeah, the new guy is cute but he gave me the cold shoulder.
His type never lasts long.
He always melts under the holiday pressure.
Frosty there needs help. He can’t find trousers that fit.
He's one of the new low-temp employees.
He wants to know if our shirts come in round.
I bet he doesn't last. By tomorrow he'll be gone. :)
The new guy has been cold to me since day one.
It's not magic - it's not even silk.
I heard him tell a customer that the weather outside is frightful, but retail is so delightful. Can you believe that guy?
I don't want to be insensitive to special needs employees, but do we have to keep the store at 31 degrees for the new guy?
The old guy with no pants is back and I think he wet himself.
He may look cute but he's Frosty with the customers.
He doesn't stand a snowballs chance in hell getting my job.
No. YOU tell him he needs to wear pants on the sales floor.
No matter how well he dresses, people will still fixate on his nose.
Don't worry, he's just a seasonal employee.
It's starting to look a lot like Christmas.
I’m gonna wipe that fake smile right off his face.
Diversity hire.
He May be a jolly, happy soul, but I think he has eyes of coal!
He’s a seasonal employee obviously. He’ll be lucky if he lasts to the end of the shift.
Maybe if we turn up the thermostat, he'll leave.
I say he's gone by March.
They said he's a temp.
Are snow balls considered harassment?
Of course they promoted a white male.
He's just a seasonal employee.
He's behind me isn't he?
Yes, he's a jolly and happy soul, but he can't fold a sweater to save his life.
Seasonal workers are abominable.
If he bothers you again just turn on the furnace
He turns out to be a big flake.
Something with UV protection.
Something tells me this one won't last.
These diversity hires are getting ridiculous.
Just tell him that he doesn't stand a snow ball's chance in hell of using ANY rest room.
I tell you it's a double standard. Imagine what would happen if I were that cold to the customers.
Like he is going to find anything to fit that butt of his!
He's looking for large, drip-dry, that doesn't run.
If he doesn't put on pants, I'm calling corporate.
I think he's a seasonal worker
The new guy won’t last the season.
Just ignore him. He won't be around long, anyway.
It should fit him better in just a few minutes.
He will need a size small in a few minutes
He won't last here long.
He won't last long here.
He's such a snowmansplainer.
He'd just better not come near me with that thing.
Sales are slipping.
He’s a seasonal hire. He’ll be gone before spring.
And I thought the last manager was frigid.
We'd be busier if it didn't have to be 32 degrees all the time.
"I'm reporting him, and his 'snowballs' for seasonal harassment"!
Pretty optimistic...looking at the new spring lines.
What makes you think he'' What makes you think he's just a seasonal worker?
He is just a Holiday seasonal hire. I have a feeling he won't be around for very long.
The new guy’s struggling. Says he can’t take the heat.
I want to make a report of sexual harassment to HR! He asked me to give him a snow job!
Don't worry...he'll be gone by tomorrow...we turned up the heat!
And all this time we were worried about being replaced by a robot.
If he can't find what he wants, I think he's going to have a meltdown.
Somehow he made it through the hiring freeze.
We don’t have to get him fired – we just have to turn the heat up.
I swear to God, if he touches that thermostat again...
He asked me out this morning. I turned the thermostat up all the way.
Some say he's nice, but I think he's a little Frosty.
Go tell him those are the summer clothes.
I'm skeptical that a 32-degree workplace is really a federal mandate.
This one won't last long.
He's finished. I just turned up the heat.
The cosmetics people told him he's a winter.
"Seasonal help!" This one's definitely going to have a melt down.
My every suggestion is met with some kind of frosty reaction!
I'll bet the new guy is gone before his shift ends.
Behind you. Customer meltdown.
He's asking for a winter jacket that converts into a pail in the spring?
He said he can’t come back for the spring clearance.
Is it just me or does the new guy seem cold?
I have never seen him in the shoe department.
Why don't the seasonal hires have to follow the dress code?
If he asks, 'Can you smell carrots?' once more, I'll turn the damn heating up.
Holiday help, am I right?
He's looking for something off-white with a 48 top and a 68 bottom.
All I said was button noses are more on trend this season.
I don't think he walked in here wearing that scarf.
Seasonal hires can be so cold.
Do you suppose that there is a snow woman?
Don't let him put anything on layaway.
Holiday hiring has really gotten out of control.
I bet the new temp doesn't make it past April.
Ugghh, seasonal workers...
And then he tells me to ‘just chill out.’
Just keep ignoring him. He'll disappear eventually.
Don't worry. I don't think the new guy is going to last long.
Yes, I flirted with him, but he gave me the cold shoulder.
I suggest Big and Tall through Christmas, Petites in the Spring, and Swimwear starting in June.
I bet the new temp won't last long.
Did you hear the new intern won't be around this summer?
He thinks he's cooler than we are and doesn't have to fold stuff.
Our seasonal help is never ready for the fire-sale.
Bet you the new guy doesn't last through spring.
What I want to know is how he keeps that hour-glass figure.
Future clean-up in aisle 5.
This new guy’s a little flaky.
In this day and age, I'm just glad it's a carrot.
I just can't warm up to him.
He wants snow shoes.
Management is taking "seasonal employment" a bit literally.
I don't care if he has no opposing thumbs. We end up doing all the folding.
I think he looks ridiculous in that scarf
I predict he'll be gone by spring.
Our new manager really gives me the chills!
HR sent him over from Shoes.
He seems flaky to me.
Such a shame. He just started last week but the Liquidation Sale is tomorrow.
I can't stand these seasonal hires.
He’s a new seasonal hire.
He is so last season.
...and then I was like, "Stop your mansplaining. I do recall the most famous reindeer of all."
I don't mind him coming to work naked, but the hat is so last Christmas.
He's cute, but i don't think he'll last.
What does he know about pants anyway?
Temps never last.
He said he can laugh and play just the same as you and me.
Trust me, he won't last the season.
I give him the cold shoulder but it only encourages him..
And his customer service skills are abominable.
The new store clerk is so cold to me.
These seasonal hires never last.
I'd describe his attitude as 'frosty'.
Sure, the boss likes him now. But how is he going to cope when the heat is on?
That seasonal hire over there keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
I envy him....if its a little tight, he just shaves a little snow off his hips....
He thinks he's sexy. He used to be on television or something.
Lets hope this new guy does not have a meltdown on Black Friday
Him? That's Frosty, the clothes-man.
He wants us to do more cold calls!
I’ll bet the new guy doesn’t last through the summer.
Ignore him. He's just another pale, stale male who'll be gone the day after Christmas.
He has a well-rounded sense of style
It's definitely not his size, but every year he insists he'll lose weight by Spring.
By the end of the season, he’ll be gone
These seasonal hires are going to melt under pressure.
His sales record is just abominable, and on top of that, he's got a frosty attitude.
His coal eyes kind of freak me out.
He thinks he’s magic in that old silk hat.
Ha ... he's got a snowball's chance in hell.
Don't let him try anything on.
He just snowmanplained why he can't work Christmas.
If we wait a few minutes he will fit into a size two.
Sure, he's jolly--but will he last another season?
Does the new manager seem cold to you?
If he rolls away with that scarf, I'll alert security.
Keep this to yourself, but I've heard from Sally that he's on the verge of a major meltdown!
He's a temp. Don't expect to see him for much longer.
He's bipolar, but usually a happy, jolly soul.
I hate these seasonal hires.
Sure, he's fine for now, but what about when things heats up?
I told him sooner or later size small will fit him
Let me tell you; last years meltdown was not a pretty sight.
He said if he doesn't get a break soon he'll have a meltdown.
I don’t know where he gets off on calling us snowflakes.
Can we hold this sweater for him? His account's frozen till July
Bump up the thermostat, he never buys anything anyway.
I'm not mopping up after him!
It's the Bluetooth in his ear that bugs me the most.
He said.."Do you have anything for an hourglass figure?"
Do you offer free tailoring, say around Spring?
I guess there really is a hiring freeze.
He said he wants to apply for our new credit card. The one with no payments till next Spring.
He's cold as ice.
What does the diversity training manual say about snowmen?
I don't think the new guy's gonna last long!
Don't worry about your job. He'll be gone as soon as the weather warms up.
If he turns down the thermostat one more time, I'm going to HR.
Do we have a size 10 below zero?
Don’t worry. His position is seasonal.
He keeps throwing himself at me.
He said after his next meltdown he will fit into a size 8.
And when they placed it on his head...he began to deliver an exceptional in-store experience.
All I know is that he got the job after we received a blizzard of applications.
He's kinda of flake sometimes.
Strange guy. He's looking for something for his wife, that won't melt her heart.
He was hired as a seasonal employee.
Before it didn’t bother me but now I realize he’s not wearing any pants.
He has a snowball's chance in hell of finding something to fit.
I'd love to be able to melt off weight that quickly.
He says he's all balls, no legs.
I don't care, running the AC in December is just wrong.
What a snow job - thought he could be an undercover boss without our recognizing him.
So when will the store hire snow women as holiday temps?
I told corporate all we needed was a warm body for inventory work. Someone there has a sense of humor.
He only sells drip-dry.
This new guy is just like all the other seasonal temps. He won't last.
I don't care if he is an icon, he should wear pants on the job.
Not the job I thought he'd do when he's in town.
He's a seasonal employee! Why does he get to control the thermostat?
He just told me he doesn't believe in climate change.
I'm all for making accommodations for him, but do we really have to keep it at 30 degrees?
Somehow I just can't warm to him
The good news is he'll be gone by Spring.
That seasonal guy was flaky at first but now he seems pretty put together.
Do I tell him Florida is a bad idea?
Oh, him? He's just temporary.
Irene in personnel said he's a jolly, happy soul but he just gave me the cold shoulder.
These seasonal workers never last past winter.
He's too frosty with the customers
Seasonal employees. It's like they pull in any guy off the street.
He keeps asking me if we want him to do the job when he's in town.
All that training and he's not going to last very long.
I'm guessing he's a temp.
Don't worry about it, you know these seasonal employees never last
He won't last here.
The new boss is a little frosty!
He gives everyone a cold shoulder.
Jolly happy soul my ass. He's just after thumpety thump thump.
He's obviously just a temp.
Sometimes his demeanor can be quite Frosty.
I'm betting the new guy doesn't last long.
I said, 'There's no man who can do my job,' and the next thing I knew they hired him.
He said the warmth of my smile made him melt, and broke up with me.
Trust me, he’ll be an Extra Small in about five minutes.
I am not cleaning up his puddles!
I told you they would replace us with temps
Seasonal employee.
He's just a temp.
They brought him on just before the hiring freeze.
Don't waste your time trying to up-sell him on the matching pants.
He's looking for something appropriate for climate change.
Worst undercover boss disguise - ever.
I thought he was banned from the mall
I don't think that new guy is gonna last.
That’s not what I meant when I told you I wanted to work in a cool store
Do you think he's open to a kilt?
He works for minimum wage....and, of course, the air-conditioning.
Well, for starters, he keeps giving me these icy stares...
I would say that him wanting to show us his snowballs is misogynistic.
Of course they hired another white guy.
Your job is not in danger. He's a seasonal worker.
He's fine, just a little frosty with the customers.
He's just seasonal help.
He says he's transitioning.
These seasonal employees are here one day and gone the next. Its like they just melt away or something.
Is it really cold in here, or is it me?
I tried to help him , but he gave me the cold shoulder.
I don't think the new guy is warming up to me.
I agree he's cool, but doesn't the thumpity thump thump drive you nuts?
I went out with him last week. It was kind of creepy. I just could not warm up to him.
What an oddball! He'll never fit in here as long as he wears the microphone on his right side.
The diversity hiring policy has finally gone too far.
These seasonal hires never last long.
I think he just peed on the floor.
I don't care if it's a genderqueer. I still don't feel comfortable with it walking around with no pants.
I guess we'll have to take on extra duties when he has a meltdown.
My feeling is he won't last past March.
He wants something slimming for the summer season
Rosario, don't freak, but I think that dude with the pointy nose could be an ICE agent.
I can't stop staring at his nose.
When did the new guy get here?" "Oh, him? Don't worry he's only seasonal.
He thinks he’ll be able to fit into those by springtime.
Crank up the thermostat. I need this commission.
Janet, he did it again; soaked the Fall line. So rude.
Should we tell him that he is looking at the spring collection?
Do we accept the Polar Express card?
That man always gives me the cold chills.
He's buying for the spring season- says he'll have lost a lot of water weight by May.
When I told him we didn't have his size, he nearly had a melt down!
Just keep him away from the silk and rayon.
I just have a bad feeling that he may not even last till Christmas.
Don’t worry, I’m sure he is only temporary help !
He's a snowman of course he's a Temp.
The new guy won't make it through Spring.
If you wait, the hat,scarf and gloves will be for sale too.
He disappears in the spring.
I hate working for a boss that keeps the air conditioning on full blast.
He's sweating like crazy Marge, and he keeps singing "Thumpety Thump Thump."
We're out of the large. If he sticks around he'll fit into the medium.
He's just a big puddle waiting to happen.
He's cute, but customers say he's frosty.
He says to just act naturally, this is a stick-up, and he doesn't have much time.
What do you think of the new guy? I found him a little cold.
This one won’t last either, I’m sure by Spring we’ll have yet another manager.
This guy's looking for slacks in size 36 round.
His account is frozen until spring.
These temp workers never last very long.
Ever since I asked him to keep his nose out of my business, he's been giving me the cold shoulder.
I hate working with him. He has such a frosty personality.
He came around same time last year. He says I make his heart melt; wants me to meet him in the park before its too late.
Mopping up after him all day ruins the magic.
If he tells me to chill out ONE more time...
It's so sad. He says his wife went to Florida and never came back.
I hope he buys what he tries on.
He said that unless the thermostat is lowered, we're preventing him from full time employment by creating a hostile working environment .
The scarf is on trend but that hat is like ... what?
That creep just asked me if I wanted to have some fun before he melted away.
Sexual harassment? No, he's as cold as ice!
He's one of our seasonal employees.
There's been another hiring freeze.
Yes, they’re hiring temps during liquidation.
He's just a temp.
I think that we are going to need a cleanup in aisle 2 very soon.

We need to use a better temp agency.
I feel like he keeps giving us the cold shoulder.
He wants to know if he can wait until spring to make payments.
New guy. I give him a week before he disappears.
A holiday hire--he won't last.
Watch where you step. I think that seasonal temp has a bladder control issue.
Don't worry. He's seasonal.
Relax, he'll be gone by spring
He won't last long. I heard he can't handle the heat.
I’m just saying, these millennials seem so passionate and eager when they start, but they just don’t last.
Watch your thermism. He presents as exothermic.
Frosty or not, carrot comments constitute harassment.
There's the new guy. He think's he's so cool.
I am going to light a fire under that new temp.
Anyway. Come summer, he'll be downsized.
Him? New guy. Seasonal help. I just can’t warm up to him.
If I hear "Frosty the Snowman" one more time I'm turning the thermostat to 90.
Who is going to raise the thermostat, you or me?
Don't worry, he's not gonna last.
Lucky for us he didn't come in with his zucchini.
Would it be racist if I told him he looked like Frosty?
The posting was for seasonal help.
There's a hiring freeze.
I distinctly remember the memo saying no white after Labor Day.
This is not what I meant when I suggested a hiring freeze on men.
Don't let that smile fool you. He's as cold as ice.
That's the new guy but he's a temp.
He keeps telling me through my headset to please chill out.
If we turn up the heat, we will lose customers.
Pretty sure the new guy isn't gonna last through spring.
Ugh, he just gives me the chills.
I have a feeling that our temp is not going to last.
All I want for Christmas is an elf that will refold the sweaters.
Says he’s planning on losing a lot of weight after the holidays.
Why do I get the idea this guy wants to buy before the deals melt away?
That's the third time this week someone has said the new guy is frosty.
He's looking for something that shrinks.
The hat is on sale, but it's not magic now.
I'm pretty sure he's a seasonal hire.
He only works in December, cranks up the AC, and ignores the dress code - what a snowflake.
HR has finally crossed the line with these seasonal hires.
I don't think he'll last the day.
The new clerk looks friendly, but he leaves me cold.

"Cheer up. He won't last here very long".
He's a temp. He has to hurry on his way.
He wants to know how hot it is in the dressing room.
I heard he got fired from Hot Topic.
These Christmas season hires are getting ridiculous.
Diversity is good but the customers find him Frosty.
He’ll have quit by March.
He dropped some packing peanuts, I stepped on them, they weren't packing peanuts.
And then boss said to me that they wanted someone who was warmer with the customers.
I think they hired him just for his looks.
He says he's looking for a jacket for the Spring. Should I tell him?
The holiday staff never lasts long.
I regret asking for more seasonal employees.
We had a hiring freeze.
He won't last a day.

Do we have any 62X20 snowpants in the stockroom?
Yes, he is a seasonal employee, how did you know?
He's the ideal temporary employee.
It's kind of weird having a naked employee work in the clothing department.
Call Security. It's Frosty the Shoplifter.

I’m getting tired of all his meltdowns
When can we turn the heat back on?
Maybe he was outstanding in whatever field he came from, but this is retail.
The new guy? He won’t last 5 minutes here.
He wants to know when the winter stuff gets marked down.
Seasonal help. He won't last.
Trust me, the new hire will be gone by Spring.
“I have a feeling that he’s not going to last here long”.
Every time I walk by, he says, 'Catch me if you can.' Weirdo.

He's very difficult to fit. Right now, he's an 'extra large,' but in a few months he shrinks down to nothing.
Watch out for the nose!
The new guy keeps asking me where we stock the magic hats. Do they even drug test employees here anymore?
It wasn't ok when I didn't wear pants and left puddles everywhere.

I guarantee you he'll be gone by the spring.

Personally, I didn't think he had a snowball's chance in hell.
I hate seasonal employees.
How should I deal with his temper? He goes into a meltdown whenever he shops.
If the new guy doesn't stop smiling soon, I'm going to quit.
If you ask me, we need a wall on the Canadian border too.
Why train the new guy?" He'll be gone by Spring.
He claims they are clean coal eyes.
How come he gets to work naked?

He's great with our tall and shrinking customers.
Actually, he's a sweetheart. He told me he was looking for something to melt his wife's heart.
When he left his nose in a water glass on my nightstand, I knew I had to break it off.
Now he wants me to take his inseam.
That look is way too hot for him.
I give the new guy until March, then he's gone.
So this is what Corporate meant about a hiring freeze.
If he says I smell like carrots one more time, I'm quitting.
He's doing okay now but I don't think he'll last through the summer.
He has a button under his desk which locks the thermostat at freezing.
He's taking these 4 sweaters. You can see why he skipped the trouser dept.
He’ll be a medium by spring
Last year’s part time help was cuter—I just loved the corn cob pipe and button nose.
I swear, if he takes one more corncob pipe break!
The new guy sure is Frosty.
He'll be gone as soon as the weather gets nice.

Believe me, this guy won't last.
He won’t be here when we need him for the summer sales.
Do we carry anything in a 58 Round?
He used to hang out in the shoe department. But that was too ironic.
I wouldn't worry. These seasonal temps never last long.
A jolly, happy soul? More like lazy, bitchy and cold.
I bet we can fit him into a small by June
Our sales numbers would be up too if all we wore was a top hat and scarf.
He won't last more than 2 hours here - just like the last guy.
I think he needs to get his eyes checked. He keeps putting the wrong price tags on everything.” “You DO know his eyes are made of coal right?
He's always giving me the cold shoulder.
I told him the fact that he's not melting doesn't mean climate change is fake science. Then he calls me a snowflake!
Is it harassment if he keeps staring at me with those cold, unmoving eyes?
He's giving me the creeps --- let's turn up the thermostat.
Don’t know why he got hired. So flakey.
He said we make his heart melt.
I only get one cigarette break while the new guy gets to go outside every twenty minutes?
Make sure he's aware of our 'No Return' policy.
Don't yell at him or he'll have a meltdown.
I don't get it, why does everyone think he's so cool?
When he leans over, his head falls off. So they put him on racks.
Oh look another Dickensian seasonal hire
The new guy asked me if I’m frigid.
There is always a puddle left in the changing room.
I don't even bother to get to know these seasonal employees. One day you turn around and poof! They're gone.

He wants to know if this comes in white.
I bet the new guy doesn't last long.
I know he's seasonal, but he still needs to wear the employee uniform.
I don't know about you, but I think this new manager is a little cold.
Carrot Nose, over there, just gave me the cold shoulder.
I'm tired of cleaning up his puddles.
In the summer he stays at a nudist camp.
If climate change continues next year, we may have to use a different temp agency.
Abominable Clothesman
These seasonal workers just aren’t made of the same stuff as us.
I don't care how jolly and happy his soul is, he gives me the chills.
We're going to need a lot more than a beloved cultural icon to compete with Amazon this holiday season.
I bet the seasonal hire won't last through the day.
Somebody needs to tell him that not everybody can pull off a top hat.

He’s looking for resort wear

Have you met the new assistant? He is very nice, but he will only be staying for the winter.
I don't care how magical that hat is, he should still wear pants to work.
He wants clothes that fit now and shrink in the spring.
Do not let him near the thermostat.
I understand people working here for the employee discount, but honestly, what's he doing at the summer clearance rack?
I don’t care how well he’s selling the winter accessories line. If he doesn’t stop replacing all the buttons with coal, I’m reporting him.
He makes one more crack about my weight and I'm jacking the thermostat to 80.
He says he's looking for a disguise. He's hiding from a traffic cop.
Security ? He's back again. Turn up the heat.
He's one of the seasonal hires.
Don't look now but it's Frosty, that creep. Don't let him rub up against you. Been in one lousy cartoon and now he thinks he's a star.
His constant cheer is getting to me - I am so close to turning up the thermostat.
Just tell him his carrot nose makes it hard to put on pullovers and Ts.

This takes diversity in the workplace a little too far.
He wants something guaranteed to shrink when wet.
He's just a seasonal hire, right?
He's not really a snowman. He just plays one on tv.

If he touches me again, I'm going to julienne his nose.
Hmmm, seasonal help. Here today, gone tomorrow.
He wants one that will shrink in the wash.
If he bugs you, give him the warm shoulder.

Let it go.
Frosty wants to know if we have both water repellent and sun protective clothing.
I didn't take it literally when they said 'You can get the job when your in town'
He's bothering you, me, the customers!! I say we just turn up the heat!
The problem with holiday help is no sooner do you train them than they disappear.
He’s cute, but don’t expect any long-term commitments.
I don't see why we need all these seasonal workers
I heard that he transferred from up north and was very popular, but I’m not sure that he’ll last long down here.
One more crack about how the carrot's not just his nose and I'm turning the heat up.
Customers like him, I predict he won't last long.
Why does HE get to control the thermostat?
I asked if he needed any help, but he gave me the cold shoulder.
That Burberry scarf is to die for, but that hat ... .
So I'm like 'Dude, lose the hat.'
Just once I'd like a male coworker who doesn't insist on cranking down the thermostat.
Is it me, or do you find the new guy in menswear a little cold?
He's not gonna last.
call HR he just showed me his snow balls
He’s deaf as a door nail, and cold as a fish, but those beady little eyes of coal burn right through you.
He'll be gone by March.
He wants to know if it will shrink.
I tried to break the ice with the new guy, but he gave me the cold shoulder.
You'd think with all the press lately they would make pants required work attire.
We're gonna need a mop.
You really need to talk to the seasonal hires about the dress code.
Being a seasonal employee shouldn't excuse him from the black slacks dress code.

He keeps asking if it’s him or does it feel hot.
They'd better not keep the new seasonal hire past March!"
I don't know. He just seems creepy to me.
We have to step it up. He needs a freezer break every five minutes.
He's just a temp. He'll be gone by next spring.
Told you the new guy wasn't gonna be hot.
Check out the seasonal help. I wonder how long he'll last.
Better not tell him there's gonna be a fire sale.
These holiday temps will never make it through the New Year's Eve liquidation sale
Do we carry any legless onesies?
Every December he buys that scarf, and returns it in January before he melts.
Find a bucket and a mop. I'm turning up the damn thermostat.
I think they're made out of clean coal.
I see that seasonal hiring has started.
This new guy seems pretty chill.
I think he has given up finding pants that fit.
Hopefully, he doesn't have another meltdown . . . last year was a mess!
He's well-rounded, but he is a little cold with the customers.
For a guy with no legs, he's one hell of a sales person.
I hope this trend of going pantsless doesn't snowball.
When it’s time to do inventory the seasonal help always seems to just melt away.
YOU deserved that promotion. He must have given HR one helluva snow job!
Yesterday he came in as scarecrow.
Hey, is that Parson Brown over there?
A hard worker, yes, but icy to the customers.
That new guy is very flaky
The new manager keeps sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.
The customers are complaining about wet merchandise. I suspect the new guy.
I don't see why everybody thinks he's so cool.
Doesn't he know it's kohl, not 'coal'?
Who do you think did his nose job?
I understand he's just a seasonal hire.
These seasonal workers just can't take the heat.
Don't worry, he's seasonal. He'll be gone by Spring.
The new guy is a little too self-righteous about climate change.
Now we know where the puddle in the bathroom came from.
Don’t worry, he’ll never last.
These seasonal shoppers are on my last nerve.
When they told him he couldn't wear that stupid hat in the store he had a complete meltdown
He says he’s looking for something that’s not too warm.
Next time I ask them to add a man to the department, I'm going to be more specific.
He goes back to Amazon’s cloud after the holidays.
He's been giving me the cold shoulder ever since I said I wouldn't go out with him.
He calls himself "Frosty" and, yes, gives me the chills.
Did you meet the new salesman? I don't think he'll last.
Every year he buys nothing. Every year he leaves a puddle.
Hiring freeze?
He said it’s just until this global warming thing gets figured out.
Is it me, or is the new hire a little bit cold?!
You want pants for a snowman!
Do we carry anything in permafrost?
Do we serve Snow-Americans in this store?
I don't know about the new guy. He kinda leaves me cold.
Enough with all this holiday sensitivity. I'm freezing.
I hate these seasonal employees...
Actually, Doris doesn't mind the costume. She gained a few pounds over the holidays.
Something tells me he won’t be working the Memorial Day weekend.
He wants to know if the Spring line is water-proof.
There’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that a top hat and carrot are part of the dress code.
Says he can't find his wife. I think she may be the large puddle of water that I saw in the warm winter coats department when I checked in a few minutes ago.
Don’t worry about your job. He’s just a seasonal hire.
Are you going to talk to him about pants?
The new guy is a bit cold.
He was late again this morning, something about getting rolled up.
I can't tell if he's melting or needs a rest room.
Shouldn't he be looking for pants?
Something about losing his parents; he refuses to work in Sweaters.
He wants to know if seasonal employees are eligible for health care coverage.
HR insists they can't force him to wear black.
He’s a seasonal worker
He said definitely not spring or summer wear!
Ugh! Seasonal employees always have such fake smiles.
Silent, motionless, unblinking icy stare, not exactly friendly... but sure knows how to close a sale!
The new guy is pretty cool.
He has not been the same since he got that top hat.
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY PANTS WITHOUT LEGS.
Wet spill in ladies department
The new hire won't last through the winter.
Says he wants a pullover that'll fit his hourglass figure
He’s a jolly fellow from over the hills, keeps insisting they’ll be back again some day.
I don't think he has a snowball's chance in Hell of making it through his first day.
I told him not to wear white after Labor Day.
He's different, but boy, can he sell the winter coats!
He could be a seasonal worker, but I think he's spying for management.
His nose reminds me it is lunch time.
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him move all day.
Just ignore him. No wallet, no purchase.
I can't stand the new guy, but I'm pretty sure he's only a seasonal temp.
I give him an hour before he melts under the pressure.
Have you noticed that he always disappears when the sun comes out?
He keeps taking the carrots from my lunch. Let’s turn up the AC
He's going to melt under the workload.
Yeah, he looks nice, but I am telling you, he's frosty.
He's looking for thermal underwear.
We don't have to be nice to him. He's only seasonal.
I said to him “38-regular?” He said “I soon will be.”
Does he have to rub it in our faces that he quit smoking?
He never buys anything. He just comes in to warm up.
Gives new meaning to the term "temporary help.
It's harassment. He asked if carrots turned me on.
Talk about seasonal seasonal employees! How long can he last ?
That new guy's a big drip.
Do we carry corn-cob pipes?
'Thumpity, Thump, Thump, Look at Frosty Fold.' Really? Every time?
He’s a temp. He’ll be gone by the end of the season.
Sure, the drip pan is a turn-off, but he KNOWS vintage scarves.
Don’t worry, his position will be open by next spring.
Why can't I get him to warm up to me?
The trouble with this type of temp is you keep on having to mop up after them.
Sure, he's doing fine now, but just wait until June.
Two eyes made out of coal? For a guy who melts you'd think he would take global warming a bit seriously.
He's only here for the winter months.
I tried giving him the cold shoulder, but he liked it. Now I can't get rid of him.
That scarf is Abominable!
Stories of his "Jolly, Happy Soul" have been greatly exaggerated.
Making him the manager is just another indication of the brick-and-mortar meltdown.
I don’t think this new guy will last long.
Have you noticed how much cooler they are keeping it in here since they hired the seasonal help?
For him, it's more about keeping cold.
One more carrot joke and I'm calling HR.
No way, Jose. I mopped last year.
Ugh. It’s the secret shopper again.
The Frosty manikin? It's a cheerful reminder of when we had snow in the winter.
Sure he's cute, but he's a little Frosty.
I'm a West Coast liberal. What do I know about snowmen?
One of our gender fluid diversity seasonal hirings
Do we have a small? He says he always loses weight in the spring.
Every year the same thing- seasonal workers with no retail experience!
Well, I think it's sexual harassment. He's not wearing pants!
I'm reporting him to HR. He just asked me to pack his snow.
Clearly he's seasonal help, but he's so good I wish we could keep him year-round.
The new guy? He won't make it past spring.
He won't last long here.
I bet he'll be gone by spring.
He come in every year but never buys a thing--just leaves a big mess on the floor.
I just feel like he's been giving me the cold shoulder lately.
Looks like the seasonal help has arrived.
He's only a holiday temp - he won't be around long.
Do you think our new diversity hiring policy has gone too far?
How do you expect me to teach someone with sticks for hands to fold?
The guy without pants is back again.
The new guy works hard, but I still find him a little cold.
And then he gave me the cold shoulder.
He’s a temp, until the spring collection comes in.
Holiday help, just get them trained and they disappear.
He said he plans to lose weight in the spring.
"Seasonal Help", huh? But will he last through the January returns rush?
Every time I look at him, his coal eyes seem to be snowman-splaining how I should be doing my job better.
Just ignore him and he'll slowly melt away.
It's beginning to look a lot like your turn to push his icy ass to the next rack.
He's just very hard to work with, always putting his nose where it doesn't belong.
The new guy is complaining about the temperature in here again.
Twenty bucks says he won't last a week.
That guy gives me the chills. He shows up every year and just stands there!
He just told me he never wears bottoms.
That new sales temp will never last.
I don't care if he is an attorney, he still gives me the chills.
Oh sure on the surface he's a jolly, happy soul, but something tells me the new guy won't last here past winter.
We only have him for one day.
By the time he makes up his mind he'll be a puddle.
He may not think he's a Temp, but wait till they light the Yule log!
I get him choosing not to say "Merry Christmas." But what's with the "Happy Birthday?"
Call HR before he goes thumpity thump thump on my rack again.
I've worked with a lot of white guys at this place, and he's pretty chill
Did he pay for that scarf?
I know, 'time waits for snowman'- but still . . ..
He keeps asking me how much each sweater will shrink.
If he can't turn his magic into sales, we'll have to liquidate.
He was OK with just taking a seasonal position.
And the best part is that his 15% employee discount doesn't kick in until March 15!
He said that he expects to lose some weight by spring.
He used his employee discount to buy all the tophats and scarves we've got.
I swear, if he suggests a sidewalk sale one more time...
Someone totally ruined the suede.
Don’t tell me he’s not standing behind me. I can feel his icy stare.
It’s all about the scarf with him
Don't show him anything that will be too warm.
What really frosts me is that he makes more than we do.
Can you believe he said he can't work the holiday? Just look at him!
Actually, he's been much more reliable since he put down that corncob pipe.
I get seasonal. I don’t get having to mop the floor every fifteen minutes.
He is looking for an XXL that shrinks to S in the spring.
Don't worry, he's a temp.
i don't even want to know what's under that hat
I just don't want to see his lack of work ethic snowball out of control.
I told you there'd be a freeze on new hires.
He said he's just here for the season.
Corporate is trying to attract the 50- to 60-year-old female demographic.
He won’t last past March.
Yes, I'm sure he's hiding something; check under the hat.
There must have been some magic in those old silk hats he managed to sell.
The new guy thinks he’s so cool but he’s a real drip.
Just wait, come Easter we'll have bunnies in the shoe department.
He's a smug, unblinking vegan.
He may be able to laugh and play, but he can't fold the same as you and me.
He wants to know if we have something that will hold it's shape.
He wants jeans. Any ideas?
The new store detective doesn't want to attract any attention.
I don't know, he gives the cold shoulder every single time I try to get close !
He's kind of flaky, but wow can he fold sweaters fast.
Can you believe the new guy actually thanked me for my 'cool reception' ?
We both heard you...something that wicks moisture!
He doesn't want the suit jacket... Just the buttons.
Thankfully, he's only here through March.
The store decided to hire him when scarves and top hats became all the rage this season.
This guy makes me miss that stupid turkey guy.
Who is he to look down his nose at us?
Either you fire him, or I'm turning the heat on.
Yeah, and I'd be a jolly, happy soul too if I'd could afford Armani shirts for Christmas!
Apparently, they're not kidding about seasonal workers.
I guess he thinks he’s too cool to hang out with us.
I still think he should have to wear pants.
He says in a half hour he’ll be a size 6.
Did you just hear a thumpety thump thump?
He's a drip, all right.
He's buying his spring wardrobe. One of each size.
I'm just saying that seasonal workers don't have the same commitment to the long term, that's all.
I just don't get why he gets a song and we don't.
If we fire him he'd melt down.
First customer today not on a cell phone.
Word is... we're going to win the diversity hiring award again this month.
He's only here for the holiday's; as soon as it gets warm, he's gone.
That new associate won't last.
How would you feel if I came into work wearing nothing but a top hat and scarf?
Where do they even find the seasonal workers?
Don't look now, but that same guy was in Ladies Underwear yesterday.
Well, the hat and scarf were easy...
If I have to train one more seasonal employee...
It's the mess he leaves in the fitting room that annoys me.
He's wants to know if we have anything in stock for a frigid girlfriend.
If you ask me he is a drip
Another seasonal employee...he’ll be gone by Spring.
He's seasonal help, he'll be here until the first spring thaw.
He says he wears the hat for religious reasons.
Don't pay any attention to him, he'll be gone soon.
He usually carries a lot of water weight.
His sales pitch is "Baby it's cold outside!"
All day it's been thumpity-thump-thump over the racks of clothes.
Our new customer service rep. I've seen this before- he'll be gone by spring.
I just don't think this is the right environment for him.
We can dress him, but we can't take him anywhere
Watch out for his disappearing act!
His agent is booking him into higher-class cartoons.
He gave me this cold glare, like his eyes were made out of coal.
I haven't the heart to tell him that's our summer line.
'I don't like the new guy. Turn up the heat.'
The janitor said he'll come mop up in 30 minutes or so.
Seasonal help. And slow...!
The new guy just gave me the cold shoulder.
That new guy is a real flake!
I can live with the carrot nose so long as the hands can't clasp.
Get ready to snowball fight for more hours. Apparently, there's a freeze on Frosty's credit, too...
No, HR 's not the answer. You can't teach someone to be warm.
He's a good worker, but every time he goes 'Thumpity-thump-thump' he knock over a rack of clothing.
Forget the magic in his hat, he'd better have cash in his wallet.
Tell snowball there that cruisewear doesn't come in his size
I am sick and tired of competing with seasonal employees.
I don't know about him. He's cold to all the customers.
If they don’t turn the heat down in here we’re going to lose all our seasonal employees.
Think he's single?
Just what the world needs. Another man who thinks it's OK to take off his pants at work.
If I had a nickel for every time some guy said “I’ve got magic in this old silk hat”...
We went out once and I made the mistake of saying Christmas is my favorite holiday. Yesterday he came dressed as one of the three wise men.
If you don't fire him I'm turning on the heater.
He claims he'll be down to an Extra Small by April.
I figure that old white guy's staying power will evaporate by the spring collection.
Don't you just hate the seasonal staff?
I'm taking that hat off if he starts dancing again.
That new hire has been awfully cold to me.
He'll never last until spring.
Our new sales associate is too jolly and happy for me ...
Does that come in Round?
We should take our slacks off and see how many scarves we can sell.
Seasonal workers. They always disappear when winter ends.
He's just a temp—gone by spring.
He looks happy now... Just wait for the meltdown.
If we take our time, we’ll have his size.
IS it just me or is it getting colder in here ?
He'll probably have a meltdown when it gets busy.
Aren’t pants part of the company dress code?
He thinks they will fit him by Spring.
Training seasonal employees is impossible.
I don't trust these seasonal workers to keep it together.
I'm his Secret Santa.
How long do you think he’ll last?
With global warming, it is more and more difficult to hire these seasonal workers
I bet you. He won't last on the job pass spring.
I can't believe they hired that creepy temp with no pants again.
They sent me another temp. We'll see how long this one lasts.
I really question whether Mrs. frosty is a petite 4.
Seems that HR is trying to branch out for the season
Don't worry. He's only a seasonal. He'll warm up soon.
Don’t you find our new sales associate kinda cold?!
He gave H R a snow job to get hired.
He won’t last through the Spring.
Is yellow snow harassment?
He seems a bit frosty at first, but when he warms up, he's not such a bother any more.
Bet he's gone by March.
Well, ya know what they say about long noses.
He says they had to transfer him out of "Stock the Bar." Customers kept chipping away his ass with an icepick.
Some are more temporary than others.
The new guy is giving us the cold shoulder.
If he brings up the unseasonable warmth or the fact that it smells like carrots one more time I swear I'm quitting!
He's a hard worker but I think he has a perspiration problem.
What does he know about shirts?
Really looking forward to the spring fashions if you know what I mean.
I always figured I’d be replaced by a robot and not just anither seasonal worker.
Don't bother; his credit cards are frozen.
Like he can fit into those clothes.
Every time I try to help him I get the cold shoulder.
Not such a jolly happy soul since we told him the corn cob pipe had to go.
What’s he doing in Ladies Garments?
Hiring an illegal was risky. However, he assured me he had great rapport with ICE.
They told me that this was a "snow job."
Who is about to melt-down?
Affirmative Action? Give me a break. He's a white dude and he just pinched my ass.
He's a seasonal employee.
The carrot is starting to creep me out.
He can be a little frosty with the customers.
And here I thought I would be replaced with a robot.
I heard he was aloof, but he's downright frosty.
Watch out for this one. He says he has snow credit.
The way he looks at me with that carroty nose is just creepy!
He says he's our new floor manager, but I think he's just a seasonal hire.
He's not happy unless it's freezing in here.
I'm going to turn up the heat but very gradually.
He's only seasonal, why is he employee of the month?
This guy's cute and all..but he keeps trying to give me a snow job~
I am so happy that 'War on Christmas' is over!
Ugh, I hate seasonal employees.
That new associate seems a little cold, right?
Which of us is going to tell him we only sell pants with legs?
Don't take it personally. He gives everybody the cold shoulder.
And don’t give him six months’ credit this time
He said,”are you married?” I said, “back off, Frosty.”
I know we need seasonal help, but I can't stand puddles in the break room.
Inside all that I'll bet there's a spy from Macy's.
So... he self-identifies as a snowman; does that mean we address him as "sir" or "carrot nose"?
Just watch, he will melt right before we have to do year end inventory.
He says he wants some Snow Pants.
Those holiday pounds should melt away.
He says if we keep the thermostat low we'll sell more sweaters.
The new guy keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
He’s shopping for his wife and he wants the same top in sizes 2X, 1X, XL, L, M, and S.
They'll say they're pumping AC in the winter to sell sweaters and not because he's a man.
He wants to know if any salt was used in the dying process for this garment?
I wonder who turned up the air conditioning.
Why does the holiday help get to control the thermostat?
The nerve of that guy ... he asked if I've ever been on the South Pole.
Top hats are so last season.
During Easter we had a rabbit in our department; so yeah, I think we're attracting the best seasonal employees.
No, he's got a real positive attitude...it's just every 15 minutes he starts to sweat profusely and then goes outside for a smoke break. I didn't even know corn cob pipes were back in fashion.
we have only approximately 39 seconds to complete this sale before he melts. Do you feel comfortable asking for his card up front?
Call me a pessimist, but I think we're about to need a wet cleanup in menswear.
He said he started in sales with cold calling.
Bet he'll be gone by summer.
I told you this would happen if you turned down the heat.
I find the new temp a bit frosty.
He was transferred from outdoor goods. We’re short-staffed because of an ICE raid.
It’s not fair that we have to freeze in here because global warming prevents him from working outside.
Clean up in aisle 3 has lost the funny.
Be thankful he’s only seasonal help.
Make him buy some pants first.
I can't stand how the seasonal staff is always dripping with enthusiasm.
He’s looking for a UPF50 cardigan.
Don’t worry, he’s only here through the holidays.
I HAVE A FEELING THAT GUY BEHIND US IS GIVING US THE COLD SHOULDER...
They weren't kidding when they said they were going to be hiring "temporary" help!
He's okay with the cataloguing but he's really cold with the customers
He just stands there, smiling. Gives me the chills.
But management told me that I didn’t have a snowball’s chance for a promotion.
O'Reilly, Franken, Lauer and Keillor--and now Frosty?
He has a hard time connecting with shoppers - he has such a frosty demeanor.
Did you turn down the thermostat?
I'm glad that our shop doesn't discriminate, but the snomen we hire always end up having meltdowns!
I am all for equality in the workplace, but do they really have to keep it like an icebox in here?
You can always spot the seasonal shoppers.
Please tell me he'll melt when the spring collection comes in.
He won't stop staring--I say we go straight for the thermostat.
He keeps pushing hats and scarves.
I didn't really grasp what "seasonal work" meant.
No Frosty, I am not interested in seeing your snowballs.
If you peek through the clothing rack, he'll show you his little "igloo."
Can you tell him to stop messing with the AC?
This is nothing. Last week I had to fit a reindeer in a flightsuit.
I didn't think that's what he meant by a hiring freeze.
Don't you think being a beloved magical being is an unfair advantage? He's stealing all my commissions.
I'm so tired of only getting seasonal help!
Their always white
The new girl is kind of cold.
He’s nice, but I bet he doesn’t make it past the holidays.
He's okay, but don't put him in the pants section.
Alright you guys, who turned up the heat again?
I am just about fed up with him always winning the battle of the thermostat!
These temporary workers over the winter are so annoying -- he'll be gone by spring.
I hear they hired Frosty for his timeless fashion sense.
I wonder if He's single
He was hitting on me and I told him to chill.
Well I tried to warn him that a warm winter sweater was a bad idea...
Have you noticed how frosty he is with the customers?
So I said, 'Dial back the jolly quotient or we'll turn your frozen assets into a slush fund.'
He took me back to his igloo, and let’s just say he was abominable...
I don't think it's chill enough.
Do you think if I turn up the heat he'll disappear?
I'd be jolly too if I was on the winning side of this thermostat war.
He wants something guaranteed to shrink.
It’s his Make-A-Wish dream, you know, because of global warming.
So, he's the reason we can't touch the thermostat?
Yeah, he says he’s a jolly happy soul, but he can be really frosty.
Watch out, since they made him manager, he's real frosty and then has a meltdown!
I need you over here. It's one of those customers who looks chill at first but is actually about to have a meltdown.
Ugh...seasonal help
Sure, we need the seasonal help. But, watch the melt down after Christmas.
Just wait until you see how he comes in on casual Friday.
I'm calling HR if Matt Lauer over there doesn't put some pants on ASAP.
Eww. He also told you that you were so hot he could melt?
He's back! Last week he tried to woo me with a three carrot diamond.
No, I haven't met the new guy yet. I'm guessing he's a seasonal employee.
I can’t wait till all these seasonal hires are gone.
This new seasonal guy's not gonna last.
That fire sale can't happen soon enough.
They all melt under the pressure.
Just because he's a snowman, doesn't mean he can come here without pants!
Of course he’s our boss. Who else would go under cover in such a ridiculous costume?!
He says I have a nice rack. What am I supposed to do?
Something to keep him cold?
The law states we can't discriminate against temperature.
What’s he smiling about? Doesn’t he know seasonal staff don’t get the employee discount?
Somebody keeps turning the air down.
He's a seasonal hire.
I'm reporting Frosty to HR. He keeps asking me to touch his carrot.
This seasonal help thing has gotten weird.
Apparently we have to lower the thermostat to accommodate a certain seasonal employee's health condition.
I tried to be friendly, but that new sales associate was very cold.
Keep an eye on him. He claims to have "found" that old silk hat.
There must have been some magic in that old sale rack we found.
Do we have anything that fits a medium-sized snowball?
We probably only have 15 minutes to make this sale before he disappears for good.
Ten bucks if you let me work the thermostat
He's the new guy in hats....
Hey Summer, could we get some more scarves and top hats over here?
Seriously, if I have to hear him ask, “Do these make my butt look big?” one more time...
The guy who sent the carrot selfie is here.
He says he won't iron the shirts.
If he makes a pass at you, turn the heat up to extra high.
By the time she makes up her mind, she'll be down to a size 6!
If I hear, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun now, before I melt away," one more time, I'm goin' straight to HR.
Would it be considered harassment if I tell Frosty he has an unusually large carrot?
Well, he's kind of cute in that David Sedaris way.
Call Security.
He folds these sweaters like he has one eye made out of coal.
Don't look he's not wearing pants again!
He's a 2x large but expects to be a medium by lunchtime.
Don't fret so much; he is only seasonal help.
Do you think he even knows what being a secret shopper means?
The customers love him, but the meltdowns at staff meetings are ghastly.
I saw him out back with a corn cob pipe.
Watch out for the new salesman. Every time I'm near him, I get the shivers.
Don't get too attached to the new guy; he will never last past the season.
I'm tired of the cold should from the new guy.
He keeps asking me if I'm married.
I asked for christmas off but the manager is cold hearted.
What does he know about the spring line?
He wants to know about the exchange policy because he expects to lose some weight come springtime.
He gave me the cold shoulder.
Just listen to the song again. I'm telling you, he has a criminal record.
I thought we were on a hiring freeze?
I haven't seen a broomstick in his hand in weeks.
He only buys drip dry.
He buys clothes in winter, then tries to return them in spring, saying they're too big.
We never have his size. He's a 42 Round.
He's just temporary holiday help.
And then he said, "You're snow welcome" to the customer. And he wonders why he can only afford a one carrot ring for his girlfriend.
We hired him as window dressing, but now it's all "Look at Frosty go..."
The fee was very high, but the agency promised a forward vibe and a "cool" sales team..
I realize we're gender neutral, but the new guy needs to wear some pants.
...but he has perfect spherical symmetry down there, you have to respect that
The jolly happy soul just screwed me out of another commission.
Ever since he got the manager job he's been giving me the cold shoulder.
That temp over there just gave me the cold shoulder.
The management keeps getting colder and colder.
..if he wants to work at Abercrombie and Fitch, he's gotta shovel off some of that belly.
I'm glad he's only seasonal.
He's warming up to the idea of a matching sweater.
Don't let the smile fool you. I find him very cold.
Really, just started working last month but he has to take off for Xmas!!
He wants something that will accent the dramatic orange in his nose.
Do we have any Yeti suits?
Who does Roy think he's fooling in that costume?
He wants to know if we could turn the air conditioning down.
Fred won't be so cheerful when he discovers what "seasonal" employment really means.
Don't look now, but those two eyes made out of coal are checking out your ass.
Must have been a typo in the ad--he says he's here for the showroom decorator job.
He's our very temporary greeter.
Do we have anything in a 46 Round?
He won't be around for the summer clearance.
I told HR he took off his pants and stuck that carrot nose in my face and they did nothing.
Just a seasonal employee - he'll be gone by spring.
Don't turn around. He's flaunting his carrot again.
One more complaint about splinters and he's wearing gloves.
Yeah, you'd think that magic hat would have been enough. And then there's the constant humming.
That’s it, I’m turning up the heat. He keeps showing me his snow balls!
He's always bragging about the size of his nose, and those beady eyes creep me out.
The new guy is just hopeless! I'll be surprised if he lasts the winter.
Corporate has given 'hiring freeze' new meaning.
Did you know we have a Drip-Dry Section? That's the manager.
I knew management was planning to hire seasonal workers, I just didn't reailize this is what they meant.
Joy, the Iceman cometh!
I just want to meet a man who can send chills up my spine
So how come there isn't any 'Token Snow women' working here?
The snowperv asked me to touch his carrot.
I don't have the heart to tell him that he's in the summer section
Is it just me or is it a bit frosty in here?
He'll never last here, all he knows are scarves and hats.
I'm getting really sick of his frosty attitude.
I think that he will be gone in the Spring!
Do we accept cold cash?
He says that he will be able to fit into them by spring.
Wait until he hears our summer deal!
He’s sort of cold toward the customers.
Who keeps turning on the air conditioner?!
He'll be a size 2 soon.
He says he gets plenty of seasonal work but by spring his prospects evaporate.
Don't look, but that creep is back again.
"Boy, this snow is REALLY piling up..." (Note to Editors: today's contest page shows the caption "Drawing by Drew Dernavich, Contest #595... but the field is completely white/blank; hence the "snow joke"....
He's got the AC cranked up again
He keeps turning the thermostat down, claiming we'll sell more sweaters.
Have you met the new seasonal hire? He's a temp.
I'm all for equal opportunities but couldn't we have the heating switched on just for a little while?
He said he's looking for a summer outfit. Something that would fit a puddle of water.
a temp, definitely a temp
I'm guessing he's a seasonal employee.
God, Karen why can't you be as chill as Gerald?
I thought they put a freeze on seasonal hires!
I told him we don’t have his size, but he says he’ll be a lot smaller by Spring!
He won't take his hat off. He must be Jewish.
All that "thumpety thump thump" is driving me crazy!
He's a seasonal temp.
Our seasonal hire just asked me if I smell carrots.
We're temporary, but he's seasonal.
He wants to know if it comes in a sun-protection fabric.
Agnes says we're missing some big buttons in the men's coat department.
HR’s having a hard time with all these seasonal workers’ meltdowns.
Sure, he's alright now, but what about when things heat up?
It's not the shirts, it's the pants that are the problem.
There's nothing more irritating than a holiday temp with a jolly happy soul.
One more "thumpity thump thump" outta Frosty and I'm cranking up the thermostat.
I try to never be alone with Supervisor Frosty. He thinks its funny to grab your ass and beg you to play with his snowballs.
He says he needs something to keep his cool.
Is it freezing in here?
He may be a good manager, but he keeps the store really cold.
he's just wants to see tops ...but i think its a gift
The Temp won't last through the season.
Always smiling, but quiet - pretty chill guy to work with.
That new guy keeps giving me a cold stare.
Don't waste your time. I came on to him and he just gave me the cold shoulder.
He is only temping until the snow melts.
You never know what you're going to get for holiday help these days!
With climate change, he needed a job inside where it is cold in the winter.
Yeah, they covered it at the morning meeting. We're hiring more seasonal workers this year.
Strangely, I’m in the mood for a snow cone.
Another damn seasonal hire
He had legs when he first came in! Tell them to turn the thermostat down!
I don't understand why he's always giving us the cold shoulder
The seasonal help is friendly enough but he freezes up around customers.
Turn up the furnace.
I’m going all thumpity-thump-thump upside his head if he steals another customer from me.
So I asked the new guy to help fold the sweaters but he looked like he'd have a complete meltdown...
He's so vain. I bet he thinks "Frosty The Snowman" is about him.
Checking spring fashions? Really?
That new girl Christine is in costume trying to out sell us.
The new guy is great, but I have a feeling he'll be gone by Spring.
Smaller. It's warm out. He'll shrink.
Guess who got Christmas off again this year?
He just keeps saying he wants to work in Accessories.
I don't think the new guy is going to last long.
He's looking for something non-thermal. He says it has to go with orange.
Don’t worry, I hear there are some management changes coming in the spring.
What’s the name of the song the new guy is always humming, for the life of me I can’t place it.
I heard he really played up his haberdashery experience in the job interview.
Unfortunately, we're out of thermal underwear.
A pay freeze was one thing. But this has gone too far.
I see that someone is not required to observe the dress code.
I didn't think there was a chance in hell he'd get hired.
Don't look. You see that guy over there? He thinks he's so cool.
That new employee won't last to spring
I wish the seasonal hires had the same dress code.
The seasonal help may be great now, but they always up and disappear.
Sure, look at him go, but watch him melt away when we really need him.
I say we get him to the drip dry rack.
Boss said we needed to add more seasonal help.
We tried. Viagra doesn’t fix the melting.
He’s not bad for seasonal help, but wait till the heat is turned up
Don't make it obvious...but, the guy over my right shoulder, wearing only a hat and scarf, just told me that he could make me a movie star.
He's just seasonal and then he'll be gone.
So, how do you feel about Santa's Surveillance Services?
The new temp seems a bit frosty.
Let’s complete the sale before he disappears!
C'mon, there's no such thing as a crime for turning up the thermostat.
Can you believe he asked for Holiday time?
Kids sales have been up since he started.
Make sure you keep him away from the hot ticket items.
Says he wants something chill.
It's not just that our seasonal hire is cold to the customers...I think he's stealing buttons.
He's really good at cold-calling.
The new guy keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
I wouldn’t even bother to learn his name—he’s seasonal.
Typical male: he only paused a moment when he heard me holler "stop."
I prefer the summer robots.
I cant believe they hired him when he shows up to work wearing THAT scarf with THAT hat
The seasonal help never lasts.
He's looking for an interesting new outfit but nothing that's "too hot".

He wants to know if we have something that has charcoal for buttons.
He's seasonal help until either Christmas or he melts, whichever comes first.
I suppose it's safe to assume he's just seasonal help.
Would it kill him to lose the hat?
I hear he’ll be gone by the summer.
He comes in every December and drips on the floor.
Just ignore him and turn the heat up.
I tried to help him , but he gave me the cold shoulder.
He's a seasonal employee.
Fine. No in-seam. Just make the customer happy.
It's the latest in Affirmative Action Chic.
The last seasonal temp was a real turkey.
Shopping for Bermuda shorts just isn't realistic.

Like he wants a Hawaiian shirt to wear to his office party.
They transferred him from summer wear.
He always disappears when the new spring fashion line comes in.

It's always the cold shoulder with him.
Me too! I say we press sexual harassment charges and see how old Frosty looks in an orange jumpsuit.
He's looking for a new slim fit wardrobe for when global warming hits.
These seasonal employees melt away after the holidays.
If he doesn't get all his shopping done before the fire sale he'll have a meltdown.
He tends to puddle when the pressure builds up
The boss hired him to take care of the cool customers.
I give the new guy a week, tops.
I hope he knows this is just seasonal work.
Can you believe it?! He's looking for something in white!
He leads the group in holiday sales of hats and scarves but can't sell pants or a shirt to save his life.
He just relocated from the North Pole. Climate change is stealing all of the jobs.
Is this what you meant by new temps?
He wants to know if we have anything in a 58 Portly!
I don't like the new employee. He gives me the chills.

Who wears a scarf indoors?
He seems friendly, but I find him a little frosty.
He told HR he was too cool for the uniform.

Seasonal worker.

I know the employee dress code doesn't explicitly say "Pants required," but this is ridiculous!
I'll be losing weight- which size should I choose?
I wish him well. But this seasonal worker give me the chills.
It's always hard for him because he drops a few sizes in the Spring

Like, he doesn't even have a wallet.
He makes lots of sales, despite being frosty.
The employee of the month gets to choose the thermostat setting.
He'll only be our boss until January. He's just a seasonal worker.
He wants snow pants.
These seasonal employees are getting more and more temporary.
My new hashtag is #MeTooWithAnIcyColdStickArm
He's an excellent employee, but he will be gone in a few months.
The smile doesn't clean up the mess in the employee bathroom.
Let me guess. Behind that rack he's not wearing pants.
I heard he'll be gone by Spring.
One date and now all I get is the cold shoulder.
Sure, he can sell a ton of cashmere but I’d like to see him try with the turtlenecks.
Because of global warming he can fit into smaller sizes.
It's a white guy looking for something chill.
I knew retail was cooling off, but
He's not exactly Abominable, but definitely a bit Frosty.
He tells EVERY customer that they're a "winter."
He's looking for something with a drip pan.
He's looking for something that's waterproof on the inside.
He's a new hire. My guess is he won't last 'til Spring.
Not a snowball's chance this seasonal temp makes full-time.
This is going to be a big sale. He'll need every size as he melts.
Forget HR; I’m thinking blowtorch.
"Let me define 'seasonal help'"...
We've been listening to Frosty the Snowman for 10 days now. We're going to need to stage an intervention.
He'll soon find out he's not as cool as he thinks he is.
Management is trying a new temp agency this year.
Why does management assume he is such an expert on winter coats?
Frankly, it’s none of his business if I’m married or not!
Shh - I hear that 'thumpety thump thump' noise from over in menswear again.
I don't know why they hired him. He completely froze during his interview.
"He always orders "drip-dry" for some reason.
If he breaks into "Frosty the Snowman" one more time I'm going to melt his ass!
He comes every year. Don’t give him something too warm.
Hes frosty, and its all ‘holly jolly,’ I forget to smile and it’s all ‘you’re an ice queen’ and ‘on probation.’
Sales of thermal underwear have gone up since he started working here.
I don't care if he's seasonal--tell him to keep his corncob to himself.
He wants a sweater that will shrink with him.
Why do guys always like the office to be so cold?
Experience you can never get online.
Just tell him you're heading for the thermostat.
Window displays also qualify for the employee discount.
Don't know why, but I keep getting this uneasy feeling we're due for a hard winter this year.
Going undercover again for employee evaluations, Mr. Blodgett?
Now the union makes us freeze in here all day to accommodate his “special needs.
That new seasonal hire is so flaky, she doesn’t have a nose for sales, and her smile is totally fake.
Seasonal help...you can't rely on them...here today - gone tomorrow
do you think he can stand the heat of the holiday rush
Don’t worry. HR says he’s just seasonal.
Management said it was hiring seasonal help.
He keeps replacing all the buttons with coal.
I dont know why but I can't seem to warm up to the new guy.
He doesn't understand that our customers can't just melt down a size.
He's complained we don't have clothing to deal with his wetting problem.
These holiday temp workers never last long. And then we're left to clean up the mess.
Just don't get into a conversation with him as to what qualifies as naked.
Global warming. Yeah, right.
I can feel him undressing me with those eyes made out of coal.
The temp help never stay around for long!
He's a temp.
" He wants to know if he can transfer to the frozen food department".
He said he would 'just die' if I put the heat on. I told him I had no time for holiday drama.
70.4 cents to his dollar AND I have to teach him how to fold.
He's looking for something in cruise wear that'll downsize.
What do you mean I overreacted? You would have no qualms alerting management if Santa showed up at work without pants.
One of my best friends is a snow person but that top hat is ridiculous.
Then he returns all of it the minute it gets warmer outside!
He always seems a little cool to me.
This blows! I can't wait to get promoted to the online team.
Guaranteed, he won't last past March... April at the latest.
Then he grabbed my ass in the stockroom and I felt this chill come over me.
I heard he's quitting for a job that's more chill.
He's white enough for Abercrombie, but much too fat. Kindly direct him to Old Navy.
Since our date, Frosty's been giving me the cold shoulder.
I keep telling him to try a Big and Tall store.
The worst part of working retail during the holidays is losing commission to a seasonal hire.
I hate these seasonal workers.
He's just a temp; he'll be gone in the spring.
I hate it when customers give us that icy stare.
He says he's a "summer."
Your right, he normally just shops for scarves.
I’m not getting any commissions either, but you have to admit that the bathroom floors have never been cleaner.
He has as much luck finding his size as a snowball in Hell.
I'm sorry, "scarecrow" is the largest size we carry in store.
That's nothing. You should have seen him on Thanksgiving.
I don't have the heart to tell him that's our summer sale rack.
They had to hire more seasonal temp workers as we're on thin ice
He’s freezing me out again.
Seasonal employees are the worst. He'll never last until spring.
Gladys...don't look now but that guy isn't wearing any pants. Better call Security before he melts into the crowd.
You wait on him--he's not wearing any pants.
I told you global warming was FAKE NEWS
Why didn't you hire the guy with the button nose? This one doesn't move.
I don't think the cold shoulder is working.
We've almost used all our "Caution:Wet Floor" signs because of him.
His fashion sense is frozen in time.
Don't worry he's here only temporarily.
He was transferred from the pants department where he couldn't make quota.
He may have some style, but he's very cold to the customers.
The hiring freeze won't last long.
They’ll fit him for a few hours in a few hours.
Keep your eye on this one, Tammy...apparently, he's got a 'history' with children.
Guess who hasn't RSVP'd yet for the Christmas party.
If I catch him smoking his pipe in the changing room one more time, he is fired.
He tried snowmanspreading me in the supplies closet.
The new guy, it’s like he’s never seen short sleeves.
Medium shirts, XXL pants.
Confidentially, I'm having a problem warming up to the seasonal help.
I don't see why he gets to wear a hat.
These seasonal employees never seem to be around long.
No, when he melts this year it's YOUR turn to mop up.
Is that the seasonal hire?
I recommended an Extra Large but she says that by Christmas the pounds will just melt away.
I don’t think the new guy will last.
This isn't his only seasonal job. That worries me.
He says he's going to lose some weight.
I tried to help him, but he's a little frosty.
He says he is Parson Brown and has a suit on hold for a wedding.
Not sure about the new guy...he keeps giving customers the cold shoulder.
I do like him but you can’t imagine how cold he is in bed.
Another seasonal worker who'll disappear when the weather gets nice.
If he was as much of a ‘jolly, happy, soul’ as we’ve heard, he’d be over here helping us fold these sweaters.
For the last time, stop humming Christmas carols into the headset!
Why does the seasonal help have to be so damn jolly?
One of us better help him before he has a meltdown.
Don't look, but I think Frosty just came out of the closet.
Don't worry about him ,after awhile he melts right into the woodwork.
Christmas is so stressful; bet that new guy has a meltdown.
I’m getting a real frosty vibe from that new associate...
He doesn't mind if it shrinks.
He knew even less about the fall fashions.
He looking for a new nose. Do we have a produce department?
It's not always about you. He identifies as a snowman so show him to the Men's Fitting Room.
I'll never know why he went into retail. He seems a little frosty to me.
They'll hire anyone for a seasonal job this year.
I can't believe his little stick arms can push a rack.
Do I tell him nothing will fit come Spring?
I asked him one year if he ever considered our coats and he went ballistic.
Mark my word, he’ll be gone by March.
A lot of these seasonal hires just don't last very long.
Never mind his frosty stare. He wants me to turn on the AC.
No thanks he returns everything in the spring
He's moping because I told him he would do better wearing a skirt rather than searching for a pair of pants with no legs.
Two eyes made of coal and a glare like Matt Lauer.
Old top hats are still on trend.
He’s just seasonal help; he’ll be gone by spring
I wonder how long he's going to last.
Don't worry about him. He's just a temp guy. I promise you he'll be GONE by tomorrow.
I'll will be a cold day in December when I lose my job to that guy.
Hi I know it's too late for the Nov 20th 2017 issue but I got the mag a little late: for the carton of a man with knife in back: "It's another "to-do" list, pinned to my back, so I won't forget"......
Seasonal workers don't last past coffee break.
It's seasonal work.
I've had enough-- he keeps asking me to get him smaller and smaller sizes
He's making unwelcome comments of an asexual nature.
He says he wants a medium. Says he is planning on losing a lot of weight by spring.
I don't have the heart to tell him in a little while he won't even exist.
I bet you the seasonal help melts under pressure.
Not this guy again. Last St. Patrick's Day he returned all his XXXL's from Christmas for XS's.
He ants to know why we don't carry sansabelt.
He believes "El Niño" is going to force him to change his dress apparel.
Quick - we need to find something that fits before she melts!
It's still not fair he takes off the whole summer.
It's harder to find help in the summer.
He asked if we could lower the temperature.
Looks like it's another diversity hire.
I swear to God Brenda, I am NOT mopping when he melts!
I heard that silk hat he wears is second hand.
Rushing to buy something before the big meltdown.
in a certain light, wouldn't nuclear war be exciting?
With all this global warming, he’s the last one left
Global warming. He needs a new outfit.
Frankly, I'm getting tried of tip-toeing around his snowflake sensitivities.
So then I said, "Let’s face it. You may be rich, but you’re still bald and ugly." That's when he got frosty.
The home office must be desperate for seasonal help.
I heard there's a holiday hiring freeze.
He won't last past spring.
We have major staff cuts come summertime.
"Watch this guy. He'll come back in two months and claim we sold him the wrong size".
The seasonal employees always disappear right after the holidays.
What was HR thinking? Everywhere this guy goes, he leaves a puddle on the floor.
He said insulated material only.
I don't think he'll survive Christmas sales. It's going to be a melt down
He only buys NorthFace.
I guess he wants you. He gave me the cold shoulder.
Oh crap, if this wasn't enough, the magic hat will now cause him to dance around.
I thought this was the snow women’s section
He says he'll melt from global warming, so he needs new clothes.
I'm thinking culottes. That or a bucket.
Keep an eye on Frosty over there, and make sure he doesn't drip on the inventory.
No worries - he’ll be gone in a couple of hours.
I'm not sure about these seasonal hires, they never last that long.
Turn up the heat and we’ll deliver his accessories to the men’s department.
He got transferred over from Seasonals.
Have you met the new guy? He's a little frosty.
They will hire any white guy and I bet this one wont last until spring.
Global warming is just a small part of the winter fashion equation.
No, he’s year ‘round—-we’re seasonal.
He wants me to touch his snowballs.
Great, now they're hiring seasonal help. He won't last.
We're all in a hurry, but that guy has about five minutes.
I got the frostiest reception from our newest manager.
I tried to tell him the Christmas inventory doesn't come in for another three months, he just wont leave!
He doesn't want something that will make him TOO warm.
I realize he is a seasonal employee but shouldn't he have to follow the dress code and wear a black suit like us?
New guy, same carrot.
He said that he's used to frosty salespeople.
He thinks it makes him cool.
The new guy is alright, but those beady eyes just creep me out.
Does management really have that big of a problem with us working the menswear?
He was giving me the cold shoulder before I got him the scarf
These seasonal employees are so flaky.
Trust me - he won't last more than a day in this job.
A bit inappropriate? Don’t worry... he’ll be gone by Spring.
He drips on the clothes, messes up the displays, and he never buys anything. I hate millenials.
I don’t know why he’s in charge of summer closeouts.
I finally had to tell him there's not a snowball's chance in hell there's anything in his size. Imagine, a waist size zero
Yeah, he's always smiling, but there's something distinctly cold about him.
"The new guy is so weird. When his shift ended last night he waved goodbye and said, "don't you cry, I'll be back again some day".
Like, plaid neck scarves are sooooo last year.
He says he's a size 7; how's that for a snow job.
He,s not the man he used to be
It’s like the seasonal associates have never seen clothes before.
I know the guy.If we don't give him a markdown, he'll have a meltdown.
He's trying to max out all his credit cards before he melts away.
How many times have I said it's too cold in here?
He won't last past spring sale.
He was hired as a seasonal employee.
With his lack of clothing, I think he's mocking the President.
He's being too cold towards the customers.
The floor manager says to let him browse until he disappears.
I said hi, can I help you? and I got a frosty response.
Seasonal workers don't usually last till Spring right?
‘...and he apparently has a great eye for fashion.’
He never returns anything
I had something else in mind when we were told that seasonal help was coming.
Don't mind him, he is just a seasonal employee
Yeah, but he disappears when the spring line comes in.
He thought the traffic cop hollered 'Shop!'
Maybe you can help him, he’s insisting on skinny jeans.
Notice how he takes a smaller size every year?
Tell him we don't have his size, but if he comes back in May, we be able to fit him.
I'm getting tired of the seasonal help making lewd remarks about the size of his carrot.
THAT MANAGER HAS ONE MORE MELTDOWN, AND I'M OUTTA' HERE.
His smile is charming but he has a cold heart.
We'll see how frosty he is when we start spring fashions...
I don't care if he's the manager, we should get a say in the thermostat.
"I don't know--something about him leaves me cold".
If I whisper something hot in his ear, will he melt or file a sexual grievance?
With global warming trends as they are, he's started shopping a few sizes down.
Something tells me the new guy is only here for a season...
Boss says he’s just a seasonal employee.
I don’t get a warm feeling from the new guy.
I'm letting him go. He keeps sneaking outside to cool off.
Keep an eye on the new temp and the temp.
Thank God he's only temporary.
I don't like his attitude: apparently Frosty is more than just his name.
That was no broomstick in his hand.
Hurry, turn down the thermostat.
I heard that sales over in Swimwear plummeted when he worked there.
Let’s give him a chance. He’ll be gone by Spring, anyway.
I'm betting by lunch he's a carrot in a puddle.
Who's hiring the holiday temps this season? This guy is a total flake!
Ugh, these seasonal workers just get flakier and flakier
I don’t expect he’ll last more than an hour
"So then I told him, if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen".
I didn't take it literally when they said 'You can get the job when your in town'
Is it just me, or is it frosty in here?
How long do you think the new guy's gonna last?
I think it is just a bit odd that we have naked snowman for an employee in the women's clothes department
I want a summer wedding, but he wants a winter wedding!
Yeah, and guess who has to clean up his puddles. ME
Watch - he'll be back in a couple of weeks claiming that the size is too big.
The new employee gave me the cold shoulder
Call maintenance. We are going to need a clean-up in aisle 3.
He always brings everything back at the end of winter!
He said, "He's not the first public figure who likes to cross dress".
Fair warning. If he has a meltdown, I'm not picking up a mop.
I got that frozen-in-the-headlights stare and a cold response when I asked 'what's up with the hat?'
Those seasonal employees never seem to last after Christmas!
Once the holiday sales heat up, I'm back to cleaning up his messes.
Yes, I see him, but the real one has a shiny nose, right?.
The new guy is really cool, but I don't think he'll last.
If we keep giving him a cold shoulder, he may never melt and go away....
He comes every year and just stands there until he melts.
These seasonal hires turn into a puddle when the heat's on.
Do you think he'll write on the receipt survey that he got a cold reception?
Ted gets too into our winter sale's campaign.
He's not wearing any pants!
Once it warms up he will fit into those sizes.
I'll bet the new guy is gone right after Christmas.
He wanted seasonal work.
That new seasonal worker keeps giving me an icy stare.
Trust me. That carrot wasn't on his face when he tried to give me a massage.
They said it would have to be a pretty cold day before he ever came back here.
He's one of those temporary, seasonal hires.
It's not our job to comment on global warming. Just show him the XXL.
I kind of like the new guy, however, he just gives me the cold shoulder
The good: He has sales magic this time of year. The bad: I don't care for his frosty personality.
He keeps messing with the thermostat.
Large, he 'doesn't plan to lose weight until spring'
He smokes a corncob pipe on his lunch break.
That's the small rack ... he should fit into it in about a week.
Don't worry, he won't make it until Spring.
I don't care if he is the house dick. He left a puddle in ladies apparel.
I tried talking to him but only get a frosty response.
Ever since I got promoted he's been so frosty towards me.
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat.
I wouldn't put this garbage on a snowman.
I don’t mind seasonal workers, but I get tired of him singing “Frosty the Snowman” all the time!
Yeah, but when there's real work to be done, the seasonal help just melt away.
He says he started out in Men's Hats.
Don’t worry. We were here when he arrived, we’ll be here when he’s gone.
``Careful. He just asked me if I liked tossing snow balls.''
Doesn't the new guy seem a bit frosty to you?
Thank goodness for seasonal help.
He's a great worker. I'm just tired of freezing my ass off.
He says the scarf makes him look fat.
At least she'll be gone by spring.
He’s only seasonal help.
New sales guy. He won't last.
He was the store's greeter, but they transferred him to our department due to his frosty receptions.
He's only temporary, and then he has to hurry on his way.
Call the cops! He's not wearing pants.
You ask me, seasonal help gets flakier every year.
That's Eric--he's just our seasonal help.
Don't look now but that guy reminds me of a poem by Wallace Stevens.
He's seasonal help.
Personnel was wrong; obviously he belongs in Accessories.
I don't think the new employee will last more than a few months.
Don't worry. He is temporary!
He keeps staring at me but every time I try to talk to him he gives me the cold shoulder.
Get the steamer from the back, he's taking all our commissions.
Full employment sucks; on the other hand, I'm sure he won't last more than a day or two.
He might make more sales if he warmed up a bit.
I just think it's weird that he traded in his corncob pipe for a vape.
Ignore him; he'll be gone in a few minutes.
It's not my fault he was dressed by kids.
.. but he has an 84 inch waist !
Have you met our new passive-aggressive helper? He gets a little frosty when you talk about his scarf.
Even if it weren't Secret Santa for a three person shift, I think I'd know.
I think the Snowman has been watching "Transparent" too much.
I told him he had to work Sunday and his face just melted.
He may LOOK friendly, but he's actually frosty.
That new sales clerk is a little frosty.
What's wrong with Frosty? He just gave me the cold shoulder
The seasonal hire is a bit frosty.
It's the only seasonal help we'll get if Trump builds his wall.
He's supposed to be seasonal. What does he know about the spring collection?
It’s annoying—I get just the right fit—then he melts a little
I tried a carrot with him, but sticks made him work.
The new guy gets lazy when you take off his hat.
I know he's only a temp, but does he always have to give us the cold shoulder?
Why does the new guy keep asking if I'm married?
It's been three weeks and his folding isn't getting any better. I'm about to turn the heat up.
What do I think of the new guy? Depends.
They hired him after he resigned his post as Christmas icon under allegations of sexual misconduct.
He says she's an 'hourglass hybrid' and wants to know if we have any waterproof negligees.
Don't fall for that 'magic in the hat' line, Carol. He uses it on the seasonal employees every year.
The new floor manager leaves me cold, but I'm not worried. He'll be totally gone after the winter clearance.
How can he be warm yet cold at the same time?
Do we have any scarves?
The seasonal hires this year are a bunch of drips.
Don't waste your time. He returns everything right after Christmas.
These seasonal employees never quite get the hang of it
It's okay now, but wait until the weather starts to warm up a bit.
Don't worry about your job. He's only here until things warm up a little.
Can you believe it? I asked Brian out and he gave me the cold shoulder.
Why are we stuck with the new trainee from Hats and Scarves?
They were hiring anyone with seasonal experience.
He's touching the suede again.
But ask him to fold and he just melts away.
Are you going to tell him or will I? This is our summer collection
He browses for a while, then melts away.
I told you that seasonal worker would be back again some day.
He's only looking a summer slim fits
Trust me. He and his chilly demeanor will be gone by spring.
these temps are great when it's slow but let's see when it gets busy if they can stand the heat
He'll be gone soon, he's seasonal help.
These seasonal workers always come in with such a frosty attitude.
He's always so cold to me.
I have heard the new guy they just hired is abominable
Don’t be fooled by the smile. He’ll just give you the cold shoulder.
He’s temporary. Doesn’t have what it takes to be here much past the January thaw.
He's looking for a reversible jacket so it will keep the cold in.
If we don't bring him in to help with inventory, he has a meltdown.
He's baaa-ck! This guy comes in every year at this time and NEVER BUYS A THING!!!
When he left his nose in a water glass on my nightstand, I knew I had to break it off.
The clientele gets super weird around the holidays.
Yes Mr. Snowman is organized and folds a mean sweater; but he keeps narrating every thing I do.
He is our seasonal short-timer temp.
New store policy. We can't turn the heat up.
Is he singing 'Baby, It's Cold Outside?' I'm calling HR."
I an't believe he is so smug and giving us the cold shoulder.
I think HR blew it. He won't last past Spring.
Wearing that scarf...like he's too cold!
He's cool but will he help in the kitchen?
He is definitely not interested in beachwear!
I suspect the seasonal help won't last long.
He's a temp handling the seasonal rack!
If he sneaks out on any job interviews, we can most likely track him down in the summer.
They're taking this hiring freeze way too literally.
He won’t last. He’ll be a puddle by New Years.
Don't look back, but the guy behind us is melting all over the floor.
I was snowed under with work this morning.
A jolly, happy soul, or just another guy who can't seem to keep his pants on?
The new guy? I find his attitude a little frosty.
Winter is NOT Coming
He could laugh and play AND work all day, just the same as you and me.
And he never takes a coffee break.
i am not sure how the Seasonal help is working out.
It's bad enough they start the music in November, but now they have to set the thermostat to 15 degrees?
No, he didn’t pee silly, he’s melting.
These seasonal workers always take my hours and melt on my shoes
Management won't let him sell any hot new fashions.
Because the Amazon warehouse doesn't have A/C.
Frank's nice, but I don't see him lasting to long here.
That rack is not his size but said he'll be slimming down.
She really took "Getting into the Christmas spirit" seriously...
He really pulls off the minimalist look.
I guess this means I won't get my vacation next summer
There just aren't as many jobs for snowmen as there used to be with global warming.
The seasonal hire seems a bit cold to me...
I heard seasonal help was in the forecast.
He keeps mentioning an ‘employee birthday discount’.
At least we know he won't walk off with any merchandise.
Don't let that grin fool - he's really Frosty.
With global warming, he couldn't make it on the outside.
He’s asking about specials on top hats.
He says he expects to lose weight very soon.
If he doesn't buy something soon, I'm turning the thermostat to eighty-five.
He's seasonal help.
He says his size is constantly changing ... so I said take the "one size fits all".
It's not fair. He gets the holidays off, but we have to work.
Sure she gets a few dollars more per hour , but at least we don't have to stand outside when we're not needed on the floor ...
When I stare into his coal-black eyes, I just melt
When he bends over, watch out for the nose
I hope he does better in our Northern branch stores.
Just you wait...he'll mysteriously disappear when the weather warms up
He's looking for an ice coat that will take him through the summer.
If he weren't so cold, he'd be our best seasonal sales associate ever.
Though he quit smoking, he still wants something in corn cob pipe yellow.
The new guy comes across as a bit cold.
This guy's looking for something that reduces shrinkage!
What size do you recommend to someone who's size will change from day to day?
He started as a window display, now he’s a seasonal worker. Should we be worried about our jobs?
I asked "Need help?" He said "Nah, just chillin."
We have nothing in his size. Should I tell him he needs to melt a bit?
Sales are a bit frosty so far in this holiday season.
Ever since they hired him, sales have dipped below zero.
I appreciate that you're trying to be accommodating, but can't we PLEASE turn the thermostat up just a little bit?!
He said it was too small.I told him it would fit eventually
Claims he once sold himself to an Eskimo.
Has that creep blinked yet?
I don't think the new guy will be here come spring.
He forgot to wear pants, again.
Don't worry, he won't be around for the Spring Sale.
Then I want a two hour lunch break so I won't melt.
This year's seasonal workers are super cold and unfriendly.
Did you ever find out who left that corncob pipe in the dressing room?
These seasonal employees are so flaky.
When business heats up he just disappears.
I don't know what to do about the new guy. He keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
Oh, he thought he was just too cool to work in Swimwear.
If he doesn't find something watch out for a melt-down!
The new guy is hogging all the commissions. Wanna go turn the thermostat up?
He says after work he wants to lead us down the streets of town.
'Very small inseam for sure.
There's a snowball's chance in hell that I'm going out with seasonal help.
I hate the seasonal help.
Just in the nick of time, they finally let him transfer up from Florida.
Ignore him. He's just a seasonal temp.
I gotta go to HR; Don just asked me to "thumpity, thump, thump" in the store room.
You don’t think HR would consider jacking up the HVAC?
These seasonal workers are too jolly.
Summer weight? Are you serious?
Such is the nature of seasonal help in the era of full employment.
Is it cold in here or is it just me?
So sad he thinks he’s sticking around after the holidays.
Yes, he is a bit creepy. The good news is he's seasonal and will be gone by March.
Don't worry, he's just seasonal help.
You know the type - they're nowhere to be found when the boss turns up the heat.
For a snowman he’s kinda hot-headed.
Someone has to tell him that the employee dress codes requires pants.
Oh, I get the festive thing. It's the no-pants thing I don't get.
That new salesman has ice in his veins.
He won't last. Customers don't like him...he's Frosty.
" I heard he's only going to be here for a short time".
OK... what do we have in our Spring Collection that is a watertight wet suit with rechargeable refrigeration... in blue?
Every time I ask the new guy to mop up a puddle, a new one appears.
He is the new guy... is a little cold with the customers but sells a lot of sweaters
It didn't get creepy until he asked me for a pair of waterproof pants.
I feel bad for the snowman. After the holiday season layoffs, I'm afraid he's gonna have a meltdown.
He’s the new Merchandise Manager, and he says that we’re not showing enough clothes for well-rounded women, and also that he’s closing the shoe department.
Ladies...pardon me. Do you have anything that's stylish and entirely insulated?
And that last customer thought MY hands were a bit chilly...
Sorry, while me is a snappy dresser, he really gives me the chills.
I think the new sales clerk has been giving the customers the cold shoulder.
He's not wearing pants. Should we alert the vice squad ?
Watch out for the nose!
The new guy keeps asking asking me out for for some ice cream. I am not sure if I should file a complaint with HR.
I want to hire him full-time, but he's only interested in seasonal work.
Ignore him. He comes around very day this time every year. Browses forever then says something about "hurry on his way" and promises to "come back again some day." Next day, same thing.
Super cool seasonal help this year.
I heard he picks his nose every day.
I don't mind the creep staring but he keeps leaving a puddle on the floor.
Since when do seasonal employees get to wear the cool headsets?
He always returns the shirts wet, but at least he doesn't wear the pants.
"I think corporate is really taking this diversity thing too far".
This new manager is abominable.
The new guy thinks he's soooo cool.
He wants the thermostat turned down.
I bet the new guy doesn't last a day.
I heard when they placed that old silk hat on his head he began to work at the GAP.
He's hard to fit because his size keeps getting smaller.
This new guy, he looks very familiar to me.
He was hired for the season, but I don’t think he’s going to last.
Management clearly misunderstood the seasonal hiring memo.
I doubt he’ll last til March.
What part of "Seasonal Help" don't you understand.
He says different sizes fit differently each season.
I realize he's got two eyes made of coal, but he's got this cold stare.
To be fair, they said they were hiring seasonal workers.
and they have the gall to write me up for being frosty to customers?
Frosty white is the navy blue of the Arctic.
When it comes to customer service he just freezes up.
The seasonal help is always a bunch of ‘no’men
In today’s climate, he really should be wearing pants.
He says he's on the run from a traffic cop.
Is it glacial profiling if we deny him the six month layaway option?
At first they seem so right, but it never lasts.
He's only a seasonal worker. Come Spring, he won't be around.
Let's see what a 'jolly, happy soul' he is when he sees our prices...
I complain about all the white male privilege hiring and now I'M the snowflake.
He's a seasonal temp. The pants department pushed him off on us this year.
The company's trying to diversify but he is a seasonal employee.
He’s going to fall apart when they tell him he’s only seasonal.
Stay away from his Christmas party; He puts mistletoe everywhere.
No! He's gonna melt; all sales are final.
Are you going to tell him? DEPENDS!!! I'm tired of the puddles.
Ugh! The seasonal help gets flakier every year.
He keeps on turning down the thermostat, so we either continue working in the cold or take action and turn on the heat and just mop up the puddle....
He's still giving me that cold stare.
Seasonal employees can't take the heat. You'll see.
He's got no eye for fashion, but we can't compete with his frosty charm.
These seasonal employees are getting out of hand.
He’s a natural with the customers: always chill, but never gets cold feet.
I love our temp employees, but this is ridiculous.
I just think he's too frosty for sales.
Pinocchio can’t find anything that fits
Mark my words-these seasonal workers are gonna take our jobs
Holiday help...he won’t last.
He demands significant size alternations come springtime.
Give it about 20 minutes then call in “ Mop up on aisle 4 “.
He's the new holiday temp. Nice guy, but I'm not sure he'll last the day.
The jolly happy soul says we have to work late on Christmas eve.
“He’s convinced size S is for Snowmen”.
But he'll be back again some day.
"I admit we need the extra help at Christmas time, but he's horrible to work with during our Spring Sale".
He says he's a medium. Maybe in the summer, but not now.
Not such a “jolly happy soul” when he can’t find his size.
Kylie, we're rotating stations. Jeremy is coming in to fold, and I'm going to need you to stand out front and slowly get more lopsided, dirty, and gray until the end of your shift.
Every time I suggest turning down the A/C he calls HR and complains I'm trying to kill him.
He had a melt-down in the lingerie department.
His sales have really snowballed!
If he doesn't have to wear pants, I don't understand why I do.
I don't care how magical he is, I don't want to hear about his snowballs!
Don't let him get to you; I'm pretty sure he's a seasonal hire.
I just wish he would stop turning the air conditioning up so high.
He says he's tired of wearing white after Labor Day.
The seasonal temp’s giving me the cold shoulder.
He doesn't need any help. He's "chill".
They'll hire anyone for seasonal help.
He wants us to turn the heat down.
That's weird. He's looking at the summer rack.
I hate seasonal employees - go light a fire under his ass.
He seems nice, but sometimes he's a little frosty with customers!
On top of all that, I heard he smokes a pipe.
What I hate are the cold calls...
He wants to know what colors blend best with carrots
Salesman, not Snowman, you klutz!
I am all for diversity in the workplace, but this guy is so cold.
Oh, him? He's a seasonal employee.
Because of global warming he has to come inside for the air conditioning.
Don't let the smile fool you. He has a frosty personality.
Wait on him quickly before he has a meltdown.
Don't make it obvious...but, the guy over my right shoulder wearing only a scarf and hat is trying to tell me he is Harvey Weinstein.
He is regular during Christmas and he buys the the same scarf every year
Have you seen the new minority hire?
Let me guess. He's not wearing pants and wants to Netflix and chill.
Talk about a guy who would melt in your arms!
The customer is not always right. I'm not turning down the heat.
Think he'd be interested in the Summer Sale merchandise?
He is trying to lose weight and he wants moisture wicking clothes.
He says he would like the post holiday sale prices now because he wont be around after Christmas
Shopping for pants, is he crazy?
At least he'll only be around for a few more months.
I'm all for equal opportunity but keeping the store at 32 degrees is a little ridiculous
He’s a temp. He won’t be here long.
I know his type, he'll be gone by the spring.
He was hired for his frosty demeanor.
Honestly, I would much prefer that you help him pick out something for his trip to Aruba.
I don't like his management style, he really needs to just chill.
Can you believe it! He says he'll fit in size 32 by spring.
He wants to know if we’ve got it in anything other than black and white.
There's no there there.
He wants to know if we stock carrot cozies.
Ah yes, a blank screen.
Wish all our customers were like him, he's such a jolly, happy soul.
The new guy said he was fired by Starbucks for saying "merry Christmas" to everyone.
I bet the new guy won't make it to next season.
He's says he;s looking for a relaxed fit in the newest style.
Do you find the new guy a bit frosty?
The creepiest part is that he used to work at that snow cone stand down the street.
He wants to try on a pair of skinny jeans.
Well, sure, I'm all about seasonal employees. But I just can't deal with this guy's attitude. He's like, cold.
She says the hat makes her ass look big.
The new guy just gave me a cold stare. Should I tell HR?
The new guy is not friendly. Kind of frosty
He's got to be the only employee ever to deny the liquid stock options we offered
It's that snow flake again, crying about, "What no water resistant suits?"
It's a new fashion line specifically for Plus-size snowpeople.
We need to get a different temp agency.
Ignore him. He’s a white man.
He says he's from Florida.
You'd think that management could come up with a less obvious way to covertly observe us doing our jobs during the Christmas season.
I can't stand these seasonal employees.
I don't know about you, but he gives me the chills.
I can't put my finger on it but there's something about him that just leaves me cold.
Get ready for a clean-up in Aisle 4.
He's probably harmless, but watch out if he suggests a roll in the snow.
It’s getting easier to pick out the seasonal help.
You won't see me dripping with enthusiasm at this seasonal job like Frosty over there.
Seasonal labor is killing us.
Is it just me or does the new associate come across as a little frosty?
The new salesman is doing a great job with the merchandise, but I’ve noticed puddles in front of the microwave every time he’s in the break room.
With all the children distracted by iPhones, he says he's had time to take up retail management.
Have you spoken to the new guy? He’s pretty cold.
Seasonal help. Turn up the heat.
The problem with the “temporary seasonal worker program” is that most of these guys just can’t handle the heat.
Don't be fooled by his smile. He's very cold.
Everyone's coming out of the woodwork before we're all shut down by Amazon.
The new seasonal employee has been real cold to customers.
He seems friendly at first, but then he comes off as really frosty.
He's perfect. The customers adore him. I can't wait 'til summer.
I don't know anymore, Jan. But I'd still like to meet a guy made of snow and with a carrot for a nose.
Have you met the new guy? I don't think he will last that long....
The new guy is cold, frosty even.
He knows his way around winter clothes, I'll give him that.
They are gonna replace us all, I am telling you.
Don't worry, he's holiday staff. He'll be gone by New Years.
Can we get maintenance to bump up the heat?
Don't let him bother you, he's just seasonal.
That's nice, but do you have anything more seasonal?
I don’t know about the new guy. He seems rather cold and he keeps wishing everyone a happy birthday.
The seasonal help always sticks their noses into where they don't belong.
His stick and carrot approach isn't working.
I can't fire him, he's just been named 'Employee of the Month'.
He's trying to sell out his line before our Fire Sale.
Seasonal help. Turn your back and they melt away.
Something about him gives me chills.
The hat and scarf are fine after Labor Day but the rest of it is blinding.
The new guy thinks he's soooo cool.
Shopping the thins? Must be betting on global warming to help with that waistline.
Why he thinks he can find something to fit off the rack I'll never know...
He's looking for something in a 42, extra frosty.
Naked snowmen have very little societal influence and blue-tooth doesn't help.
I got your note!
Can you help me measure his inseam.
The new hire leaves me cold.
The new guy seems kinda cold hearted doesn't he...
He is looking for black leather gloves. Something Twiggy might have worn.
Says he is looking for an outfit that will make his rear look smaller.
Is it just me or is the new guy giving us the cold shoulder?
He’s pretty good with scarfs and ear muffs, but he doesn’t know much about pants.
What does he know about cruisewear?
The snowman keeps giving me the cold sholder!
He’ll disappear when we really get busy.
He comes off pretty cold, don't you think?
He has one minute to start helping us fold or I’m taking out the blowdryer.
Pish posh and this seasonal help. I don't care that he's a snowman, but that Burberry is soooo yesterday.
I think the new guy is a little flaky.
Do you think he realizes his position is only seasonal?
The new guy needs help dressing.
I wish he would stop humming that song from Frozen!
He's looking for something that will reflect the sun.
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat in the lost and found.
yeah he's a cop, those are short sleeve summer shirts.
Why am I always stuck training the seasonal help?
He sure is jolly and happy for seasonal help.
He's only seasonal. In the summer, he works in a water park.
No one told him he’s just a seasonal employee yet.
Seasonal help is one thing, but this is ridiculous.
He keeps asking if we can turn the thermostat down,
He's a little creepy Eyes like coal...
Sure he's nicer to the customers, but that's only because he's seasonal.
There's talk of downsizing this Spring.
Maybe we should tell the customer that our summer collection won't be available until April.
Well, if I was a dude in today's sexual harassment environment, I'd be giving all the female employees the cold shoulder too!"
Spends a ton every winter, summer comes, bupkis.
Last time I sold him a sweater he disappears
The attitude of the seasonal hire is a bit frosty.
He comes in every year. Never buys anything.
I'm considering him for full-time after the holidays.
He expecting the weight to just melt away.
He only talks to snowflakes.
I just want to wipe that damn smile off his face.
He's only a temp--he'll be gone by spring.
I asked him to remove his hat. He just stared at me blankly.
The new employee has an icy exterior but it melts away quickly.
I hate the holidays!
Take a guess who's winning the Winter Coat Sales Contest?
I'm guessing he's a seasonal worker.
If he asks me one more time if I'm married I'm going to HR.
If that snowman steals one more commission with his "Hi! Frosty out there! Actually, Frosty in here!" routine I'm gonna bust out the flame thrower.
I guarantee he'll be gone before spring.
He seems a little frosty today.
The seasonal help gets a little stranger every year...
I'd like to make a a hundred strawberry snow-cones out of him.
Is it me or is the new sales guy a little cold?
I guess playing "Let it Snow" all day wasn't enough.
Can you believe he doesn't have a credit card? He said he only uses cold, hard cash. I'm waiting for approval from the manager.
He's looking for something that will shrink over time.
You’re lucky he’s not your manager. He’s so cold!
I don't know; he just gives me the chills.
He’s just here to help over the holidays. I doubt he’ll last long.
He wants a shirt which wicks away snow melt.
'Guarantee ya that he won't last around here through Christmas.'
Just ignore him. He will soon disappear.
How many corncob pipe breaks is this guy going to take?
I recommended wash and wear because he refuses to use a clothes dryer.
Can you believe it? On my last performance review he said I was a little too cold with customers!
I hate working with the seasonal hires.
Just wait till spring and we'll see who's floor manager.
He's here to promote the new winter line.
I don't know how he gets away with exposing himself.
He's just now heard about global warming.
He's requesting off for the holidays.
Make sure you get cash. He never paid for the hat and scarf.
Hmm...wonder what happy pills he is taking.
Finding pants to match is going to be really tricky.
Always returns.
Well at least he won't be trying to return it in the Spring.
He'll never get it over his nose.
I don't think they're even trying in HR.
Let it go, Elsa.
Try a small -- he's planning on losing a lot of weight.
Yeah, he’s a hard worker, if you don’t count the freezer breaks.
He wants it two sizes smaller. He's planning on losing a lot of weight next Spring.
He's such a fair weather friend.
The shirt will fit him. Just give it an hour or so.
He needs a size 40. Ooops, make that a 38. Whoops, looks like a 36. Will you please have someone turn down the heat?
I don’t know why they say retail is melting.
He means well but he's melting all over the clothes.
So that's why it's 25 degrees in here.
He's cool but can he sell pants?
The new guy is just so cold
I just find him really cold.
He’s good, but can’t work full shifts.
Karen, did we have to take this guy? Customers keep screaming when he moves.
Well, thunpity-thump-thump, look at the new seasonal employee go!
Mr. Drama King there says he’ll DIE if he can’t bring that rack outside.
He can't find pants to fit. Any ideas?
Be careful. He's prone to putting his nose where it doesn't belong.
The new temp seems a bit frosty.
But seriously, I'm the one on the verge of a meltdown here.
Just because it's December, doesn't mean everything has to be holiday-y
I used to enjoy Burl Ives, but giving the seasonal temp a headset forced me to re-evaluate.
He wants warm but not too warm.
Yeah, we had some laughs. Then he dumped me for some ice queen.
I'm getting a frosty look from the fat guy behind me.
HR's genius; he works the holiday and melts before his check is even printed.
He's seasonal, and said he'll be back again someday.
Just because he's a man, why does that mean he doesn't have to fold?!
See, I told you global warming is a hoax.
He’s a little cold at first, but once you get to know him... he’s just so chill.
He assures me that fashion dictates a wider tie.
He wants something casual that shrinks with global warming.'
He always disappears for our after Christmas sale.
He's a seasonal fill-in from Home & Garden.
Even his staring gives me the chills!
Honestly, he just gets so frosty over the least little thing.
Somehow the season always sneaks up on me.
At least he won't pinch your butt.
He says he IS security.
He’ll be gone in the Spring just like the last one.
Not liking the new manager. Let’s crank up the heat.
I don't think it's by accident. He keeps touching me inappropriately with his carrot.
He'll be gone before Christmas.
I've noticed that seasonal hires like him just can't stand the heat.
His carrot is literally always hard. What's the HR number?
By the time he tries something on, he's a half size smaller.
I don't see why we have to suffer with such a constant cold temperature in this store, just to satisfy some of the odder customers.
Seasonal workers always mess with the thermostat.
He plays the, 'I'm going to melt at the end of the season,' sympathy card with every customer
Don't give him anything on layaway.
She told me,“Do it before it’s too late.”
He actually likes the wage freeze.
I suppose we should count our blessings. Last Christmas, the temp agency sent over the Grinch.
And then, he touched me with his snowball.
He's great at folding and restocking, but he's a little frosty with the customers.
He says he'll pay cash. Cold cash.
I didn’t think we hired jolly, happy souls.
I may be coming around to your point of view.
Oh, look! It's yet another week where the cartoon is not visible on any kind of browser.
It doesn't seem fair that the seasonal help is exempt from the dress code.
Just once, I'd like to see him buy something for Spring.
If he adjusts the thermostat one more time, I'm releasing a family of rabbits from the pet store.
He is only working until the spring thaws.
He says it's Siberian Monday.
It really is a frigid corporate environment around here.
He says he'll buy everything on the rack as long as he doesn't have to pay until August.
I am really getting tired of these seasonal employees
Is an invitation to snowball sexual harassment?
You watch - when the spring collection rolls around, he'll just melt away.
I perfected my "too-cool," frosty reception working my last job at Barney's.
He says if we don't crank up the A/C, we're looking at one sweet lawsuit.
He claims our free next day shipping doesn't meet his needs.
This is his third time in here this week but he doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell.
His manner is a bit little frosty but customers love him
Don't worry, he's just a seasonal employee.
He wants to know if he buy an extra extra large now and exchange it for a small in about 2 weeks ?
I'm betting he'll melt under the holiday pressure.
Somebody's gotta tell him to stop asking people if they're married.
By the time he gets through the checkout line he'll need it to be two sizes smaller.
Pretty sure it's a carrot....
Betcha he'll melt when there are real crowds.
If sales don't improve with the new guy, we'll have to turn up the heat.
If we don’t give him an extra 10% off, he will have an epic meltdown.
I was okay when the witch and the pilgrim outsold us, but this is just sad.
I know the type: he seems like a jolly, happy soul, but in a couple of months he’ll just melt away.
I'd be happy too if I could afford a nose job like that.
Three customers have already slipped and fallen because of the new guy you hired!
I can't wait until January when the seasonal workers finally leave.
His job application says to notify Frosty in case of meltdown.
“ Fros Tee “ is a great employee, but I have my suspicions about him being from Tampa.
He asked me if I liked his carrot. Should I call the press?
WHITE; All-Balled-Up-In-Himself and pointing a Big-Orange-Carrot our way as well.
He won't be here long. He's just a seasonal hire.
The new guy's pretty hot.
He’s crazy if he thinks he’ll fit off-the-rack.
Are you getting a chilly vibe from our new sales associate?
Ugh, he never lets me turn the AC up.
We ask him to come in to help sell the winter stock but he's always looking for "Parson Brown" clothes.
If he melt I'll take the scarf
I think our new associate needs additional customer service training. He comes across as rather cold.
Frosty's card has been declined.
He says he’s looking for something that’s not too warm.
And, he insists he's a size 10!!
Well, none of that's going to fit him in the spring
Yeah, the new guy smiles and all, but he still leaves me a little cold.
How come the seasonal guy never works on Sunday?
I'm so sorry about having to ask you to cover the fitting rooms again. I've already asked him twice and he said the spot lights back there would be murder.
He can't fold these. They're "dry clean only."
...management's attempt at diversity, but he's a flake. He'll be gone by spring.
He does things differently but who am I to argue with the boss’s nephew?
Between the earpiece and the loud scarf, shoplifters will be on to him in a second.
You'll get used to the Manager; just play along with his weird disguises and your rating will be good.
He can only sell scarfs and his arms are too short to fold anything! Why did they hire him?
He's doing fine now, but he'll be gone by spring.
Since when did we start hiring seasonal characters instead of workers ?
The children were wrong. He can't "laugh and play just the same as you and me."
He makes me uncomfortable. He asked where he could find a snowblower.
They used to show up frequently prior to global warming.
Hope he does not have a melt down.
I heard the new manager say no one is getting Christmas Eve off; he seems rather cold.
Playing hooky. Says he's too cool for school.
The warm winter will mean a flood of returns.
I try to warm up to him but all I get is a cold shoulder.
'Have you noticed how cold the new floor manager keeps this place?'
You know he doesn't need trousers or a shirt. Just a scarf will do.
Everyone loves him now, but trust me, he won't even last through a single season.
He's our newest seasonal help. I don't think he'll last long.
His hat just happens to fall off whenever I ask him to cashier.
He can't fold for a damn, but he sure is cool with customers.
He takes a bunch of things to try on, says that nothing fits right, then leaves them in a pile in the fitting room, soaking wet!
The new guy is kind of cold, don't you think?
I think he's a company spy. Notice the mike.
He keeps asking for non-lined underwear.
If he's so damn jolly and happy how come he's not working on the window displays?
He takes advantage of our exchange policy every Spring when he drops weight.
I told him be aloof but all I'm getting is frosty.
I swear, if he doesn't stop singing "Frosty the Snowman," I'm going to crank the thermostat up another 10 degrees.
If he gets too pushy, just take off his hat.
I dunno, don’t you think the new guy’s just a little...chilly?
Don’t worry about your job, he’s strictly a seasonal employee.
Don't count on the seasonal help to stick around for spring inventory week.
The cold stares, the little puddles, It's like this every year with the seasonal workers.
I can see he's seasonal, but I'm worried he'll melt under pressure.
I never thought he'd be such a hothead.
I hate waiting on him because the next sunny day he returns everything claiming all of his girlfriend’s sizes have changed.
Management is happy that snow is also cheaper in China.
And what exactly is it about him that makes you think he is just seasonal help.
All the "hard to fit" customers seem to gravitate to him.
I bet this new manager has no staying power.
Literally.
I've got the new hire hanging shirts so he's not shrinking the sweaters.
I’m a little worried about our show. The new guy seems like one to melt under pressure.
It's the gig economy.
Yeah, but he always ends up buying online.
Cold in here?
He's looking for something that won't last.
If Frosty followed the news, he'd know he'd better be shopping for pants.
Don't let him try on any pants.
He's looking for something "apres ski."
Does anyone still wear a hat?
Do you feel a draft?
I know customers can be in denial about their winter weight but those hips are not squeezing into a size 32
Don't worry about his size. It won't last long anyway.
We're completely out of WET FLOOR signs.
He'd be a great manager if weren't so frosty
He wants size extra-round.
I don't know why they hired him. His section is always wet and smells like carrots and pipe tobacco.
Yeah, my Trump vote didn’t work out so well
Well, if you only pay minimum wage, you get only seasonal help.
I'm afraid the new guy won't be able to handle the heat of the shopping season.
Why does the new guy get to set the thermostat?
He melts, and we have to fill in for him.
I feel like they are giving me the cold shoulder.
They bring on these seasonal workers and then, after the holidays, they just melt away.
Can you believe it, he wants something to keep the cold IN!
It's his idea of funny to peruse the summer close out sale.
I'd trade for his stick arms to get out of folding another sweater.
Dammit he likes it when I give him the cold shoulder.
He needs a matching belt.
He was the top hat salesman in November and the 'Employee of the Month' in December.
Does the new guy seem a bit cold to you?
I'd ask him to stay on, but, he'll be gone by the end of the season.
The seasonal help this year is just so cold to the customers.
He wants to know if it is waterproof or just water resistant?
He said he couldn’t live without that ridiculous hat.
He keeps insisting that he needs a summer wardrobe!
He redefines 'seasonal temp'.
He's way too jolly this time of year
So much for online applications...
Enough with the snow balls jokes.
I think we should let management know about Tim's over-fascination with top hats and scarves at the same time we bring up the leak that seems to be spreading around the store.
Apparently, the scarf is not enough.
Those two eyes made out of coal are creepy.
Do we offer Snow Day discounts?
If he's Christmas shopping for hot pants, I'm outta here.
Frosty says he needs to "lighten up" his wardrobe.
And all of these items are waterproof.
Don't worry, he'll be gone by May.
When I worked in appliances, I sold him a refrigerator.
If his snowballs get anywhere near me, I swear I'm getting out the steamer.
More like snowJERK.
If you say "clean up on aisle 4", I'll slap you.
Ugh, he will literally do ANYTHING for a commission.
Nametags and microphones. Whatever next?
Don't throw shade on him, he's just chillin'
If you ask him to put some pants on, he just smiles and says "Snow problem!"
I asked if he needed help, but he just gave me the cold shoulder.
How am I supposed to fit this guy when he keeps melting?
I think he's got his eyes on you.
I think this is the beginning of a turf war with the new guy.
He says he's hoping this will be a permanent job, but I don't think he will last till summer!
I know he seems cold, but at least he's just a seasonal employee.
We don't guarantee against meltdown.
Oh him? He's the new guy who came in from the cold.
So I guess we'll be seeing this guy's junk until New Year's.
The manager wants more scarfs out front. Always the stupid scarfs!
Seasonal hire.
Tophat wearing motherfucker can eat a dick.
The new boss is pretty cold!
If you ask me, these seasonal employees try just a little too hard.
Don't worry; He's just seasonal.
Better turn the heat down or he'll have a mess of a melt down like he did last time.
I can't possibly find pants that fit him.
He's always here for the pre-Christmas sales.
Yes he's the new guy, but I have a feeling he isn't going to last long.
Shirts haven't been a problem but I'm not looking forward to when he asks about pants.
Our new boss "forgot his pants" again!
I hate holiday temp workers. As soon as you ask them for help they have a meltdown.
What makes him so cool?
With sales heating up, I don’t expect some of the seasonal employees to last very long.
I know I asked for "seasonal" help but I dont know if this guy can stand the heat of a holiday crowd.
Who do you thinks gonna have to mop him up come spring?
How come the seasonal employees always act so helpless?
Do you honestly believe he actually intends to stay on after the holidays?
Is it considered sexual harassment if your coworkers don't have any clothes on?
Oh, the weather outside is frightful!
What do we do when he melts.
I don't know...he seems a bit frosty to me.
Did you remember to turn up the thermostat?
he wants to know what are the latest winter trends
Why do we hire Seasonal Flakes? They are so unreliable.
Oh, that’s the new Summer Wear buyer. He’ll never last.
I heard Santa Claus refuses to come to town on CyberMonday.
Sure, if I came to work with no pants, it's be on the news. Not so, for Carl!
Wait, Mr. Snowman has been accused of sexual misconduct?
They said they were going to promote from within.
He says he's the new rep for the shrink-to-fit line.
Easy to predict when a holiday temp hire won't be able to handle the heat of the shopping crowds.
The agency said VERY short-term seasonal temp.
He thinks he's hiding his boner behind the clothes rack. Perv.
Do we have any gloves for stick fingers?
You better serve him. He keeps giving me that frosty look.
I'm beginning to doubt he's keeping the store so cold to boost sweater sales.
All I know is that when I tried on his hat, I began to dance around.
"Elegant but slimming." What do we have?
And then he started whistling "baby it´s cold outside."
Okay, fine, I can be just as cold to the customers as our seasonal help but at least I’m wearing pants.
Who knew that Frosty was trans curious?
There must have been some magic in that old coat rack he found...
He'll never make it through the summer season!
He keeps giving me the cold shoulder
I keep giving him the cold shoulder, but he doesn’t listen...”
Do we carry anything in gender neutral?
Keep an eye on him: I heard he had a run-in with a traffic cop earlier.
Don we now our gay apparel?
I'm being stalked by a snowman. He's cool, but every time I get close, he gives me the cold shoulder.
It’s April. Why won’t he just go home already?
He's friendly with the customers and smiles but he still leaves me feeling cold.
No pants, no shoes, no bodily fluids on the floor.
The song said he’d be back some day, but I didn’t he would be working at the Gap.
He says he has a problem with sweat stains.
I bet he'll be gone by the end of the season.
I'm giving that seasonal worker the cold shoulder.
So the new guy says he doesn't want to iron, I don't think he's going to last.
I'm confused. Are we working the call center, too?
It wouldn't bother me, but he always leaves puddles in the floor when he comes in.
He's never even going to see our summer line.
Let's turn up the heat.
He's a little cold. But hard to find good seasonal employment.
I tried to give him the cold shoulder but that just encouraged him.
He’s less jolly than I expected.
Someone in HR is way too literal this year.
The customer is requesting that the airconditioning be turned up
Ever since the holiday party, he’s been really cold to me.
I understand we need the extra help for the holidays, but this guy gives me the chills.
I'm finding this seasonal cosplay a bit creepy.
As long as we keep him away from the thermostat...
Sure he'll be gone come spring, but I still don't understand why he doesn't have to wear pants.
The seasonal help will be gone soon.
Is that the new seasonal employee?
I’m afraid that we’re just going have to adjust to his slow pace. No lighting a fire under him.
He's preparing to transition.
We're selling dreams, not cruisewear.
The last one didn't go well. He wants to know if we'll handle the next pants sale.
He browses but never buys. It's time to turn up the heat.
He's the new guy. He won't last very long.
He must be one of the holiday "diversity" hires but I doubt he will last more than a few days.
He just hates it when I tell him he's a plus size."
Don't worry, he gives everyone the cold shoulder.
He fears harrassment charges, so needs pants to cover his other carrot.
You should have seen him try on a pair of pants.
This new employee is really bothering me, can you turn the heat up?
If you want to get rid of him you need to turn up the heat.
Seasonal help. I give him one day tops.
Have him try something from our global warming section
Do you really think he'd be manager if he weren't a snowMAN?
Don't get too attached. He's just a seasonal worker.
Frumpety frump frump.
Our cartoon budget might have been cut too far
No way in hell Frosty's gonna make it in retail.
I just can’t warm up to the new guy
If you think Santa is obnoxious, check out this freak!
When do we put out the Spring line?
Typical seasonal worker--he just asked me what pants are for.
Do you have one that's waterproof, in a stretch fabric with big black buttons? It's ok if it shrinks in cold water.
Helen said he was just a seasonal employee, but how can we be sure?
These new employees never last; they just seem to melt away.
I don't think he'll fit into those sizes till April!
Sharon can be so cold sometimes!
So I said, 'Frosty, either get these clothes in order or I'm starting our fire sale.'
What frosts my booty, is he never buys anything.
Is it just me, or is it cold in here?
When he said he’d be back, he didn’t mention as my boss.
I only got as far as "et tu" and it was all over
The new guy's giving me the cold shoulder.
I just don't understand what she spends her split of the tips on.
Can you help me? He's looking for something to keep him cold.
He’s good, but he’s a seasonal worker.
He comes in every year and only shops the winter line.
Sure, but let's see how well he does during the Spring collection.
He might have legs by the time he tries them on.
The new seasonal workers won’t be here forever.
He only knows scarves.
And it's not even the first time!
Well, Enid, here's that 'White Christmas' you've been dreaming about. Are you happy now?
I just got your lawyer's demands.
This cartoon is so subtle it's not even visible. Or my eyes might be going bad. What about the lights. Did anyone turn on the lights?
After we describe the null field...
We went on one date, but now he just gives me the chills
Do we have anything in that size?
The new associate's a bit frosty, but his sales numbers are good, so...
It's not even October and the temp agency sends this guy...
He want's to exchange the muffler for a window air-conditioner
He says he's going to go bottomless but not topless.
I asked him if it was a gift or for himself! He was kind of cold and wouldn't say!
I hate seasonal hires too, but I don't think freezing him out is working.
Why doesn't he have to follow the dress code? It shouldn't matter that he's a seasonal employee.
If he turns down that thermostat one more time, I'm going to stick a jalapeno up his part-time backside...
I always thought she might knife me in the back but not with divorce papers!
He’s a good worker. A little bit cold, though.
And they said I had a frosty disposition!
He's cute, but the racks are always wet.
I get a chill every time that creep with the charcoal eyes comes around
Sheesh! He's getting here earlier and earlier each year.
"He says he can't find anything in his size ".
That new employee gives me the chills every time he comes around. I hate him!
I’ll bet you a triple pump extra hot no fat upside down pumpkin spice bourbon his account’s still frozen.
They promised me he'd only be a seasonal employee.
He wants our "no payments for 6 months deal"
The new temp is all very jolly and happy, but the constant thumpety-thumping is driving me nuts!
He's looking for something that says "Jolly Happy Soul".
Now that Trump has won the war on Christmas, this place will do anything to hire whites.
He says he is looking for something to wear to a Frosty reception.
Now we’re hiring winter interns
You distract him while I turn up the thermostat.
He may be happy and jolly but watch out for his cold hands.
He's a very jolly soul, but he can't fold for shit.
He’s really been moving those silk hats though.
Customers always love his recommendations for top hat and scarf ensembles.
He's a hard worker but a bit of a snowflake
He seems very interested in the bargains in our summer wear!
Sure it’s cold in here, but the climate models still show that the average global surface temperature is expected to rise further.
I just want to melt his heart, not the whole him.
Fire sale starts tomorrow.
He keeps blocking the aisles. Can we turn the heating up?
I agree. The hat does make him look thinner.
One more "Look at Frosty Go" and I'm turning up the heat.
Something about him gives me the chills.
He's been doing this since Greenland melted.
He's just seasonal help.
He says he's an extra large but he will be a size 0 by Summer
That creep asked me if I want to melt him.
This seasonal help won't last forever.
The new guy keeps melting all over the merchandise.
I am really getting sick of it being so Frosty in this place.
I've tried to talk to him but he's very cold.
This is going to sound racist, but...
He’s asking for a large before he has a meltdown.
'He's just a pop-up vendor. He'll be gone soon!'
I'm just about at the tipping point with that guy.
He's fine. I'm just tired of freezing my buns off.
I can't stand these seasonal workers.
I'm still warming up to the idea of diversity on the workplace.
He wants to know what's hot.
She had wet spots all over her so, yeah, I think it's a credible allegation.
He keeps trying to spread holiday cheer. Doesn't he know I'm Catholic?
Does it feel cold in here to you?
Okay, as temps go. But mention the carrot and he calls HR.
Get a load of the beady-eyed weirdo standing behind us.
I understand nondiscriminatory hiring requirements, but someone's gonna slip.
Told you they're trying to replace us with jollier, happier souls.
He always buys on layaway in winter, but his interest melts away by spring
I hate when the holiday help vanishes and leaves us the clean up the mess.
Something tells me he’s only going to be temporary.
It would be bad enough if robots were taking over our jobs, but this?
He is a bad credit. Only take cold cash.
Every year. Three hundred bucks to the counter, and then cold feet.
"They're all Slim-Fit. Do we have Fat-Fit"?
Hat and scarf. He buys the same thing every year.
May I suggest bringing out three sizes from our Halloween pumpkin line?
It has been such a warm winter he needed a part time job to pay for refrigeration.
He's looking for something that accentuates the coal in his eyes.
At least with this holiday hire we don't have to worry they'll make him permanent.
He wants an electric blanket.
Bernie, I know it's you from Drama Club. Turkey, snowman...Santa...just melt off!
I'd like to know who had the idea to have a sidewalk sale in the middle of winter!
Tell me again how he will sell all these women’s sweaters when the store opens.
It seems to be getting colder in here
He says he'll perform better in Swimwear.
That new guy gave me the cold shoulder.
Ugh, the holiday season really makes him come alive.
He wants a sweater that is attractive but not warm !
I know the hat's not company policy, but if you take it off, he just freezes.
I don't know why she bothers. She'll only have to get it taken in tomorrow.
I don't care if he is Employee of the Month. He's been giving me the cold shoulder all week.
He's not so smooth. I heard he was caught picking his nose at the supermarket yesterday.
What do you mean, his butt's too big? That's just the way he's built.
Insists a size six will fit.
He never says anything, he just gives me the cold shoulder.
I feel cold. He's looking at me, isn't he?
I'm just afraid that he is going to leave a puddle.
He keeps getting coal dust on the new winter supply.
HR says he is not really a snow MAN, so the only risk is that he melts a little on you.
Tell Frosty, there are no returns due to a melting physique.
Don’t let his warm demeanor fool you, he’s as cold as ice.
I just don't see him moving up to cruise wear.
I offered to help him but he gave me the cold shoulder.
Yeah, we dated. Froze my butt off!
Who's the new seasonal employee?
Management wants us to project an icy demeanor, but Stan always takes things too far.
He should really wait till summer after he loses the winter weight.
I don't care if he's promoting the winter collection. He's stealing my job AND getting the clothes wet.
I don’t care what they say, working with him is no fairy tale
Notice how he conveniently only shows up during the holiday season?
He's been surly toward customers ever since I took his pipe away.
I've had it, Frosty really overstepped his bounds when he asked me if I've been naughty.
He's looking for the new summer line
Is it me, or is Steve taking Halloween a little too far this year?
Oh God he's back...whatever you do don't make coal contact.
Unless you want a harassment suit, do not call him snowflake.
Tough to shop for...once the holiday season ends he really looses a lot of weight
I don't know how she keeps getting employee of the month. She's so cold.
Last year I gave him a fitness watch and it's still in the freezer.
Is all our stuff non shrink?
Why do all the seasonal hires get to go shoeless and short sleeved?
He's from Sears...won't be here long.
I hear he just helps out seasonally
This guy is always returning socks.
Have you ever heard of a 42 round?
I thought I saw someone tinkering with the thermostat earlier.
I wonder who came up with this White Sale promotion.
He really melts my heart every time he comes in.
Who cares? He's melting.
I mean, at least she can accessorize.
I don't like him either but he really appeals to millennials
Okay, so he knows Christmas sweaters, but I'd like to see him sell cashmere.
I dunno, he seems kind of cold to me.
Is it just me, or is it cold in here?
He wants us to turn off the heat.
He claims that he's a morning news anchor, but all I know is that he couldn't wait to show me his carrot.
He’s got a good sense of style, but he can be a little bit frosty.
He wants something that will look as good if he loses a few pounds
Don't waste your time with the new guy, I tried, but he just gave me the cold shoulder.
Don't worry Sally there is no chance that our new head of department is a sexual predator word has it he is very cold.
Don't look now, its Roy Moore again
No use making friends with the holiday temps. They just melt away.
He answered the ad for seasonal help
I bet you he'll be gone by June.
Should I tell him or will you?
Don't worry, he's just seasonal help.
Like, he knows a thing about summer fashion.
Hey Snowman, go back and put your pants on.
I think management has taken seasonal temp hiring a bit too far this year.
Yes, he's nice, but somewhat cold.
He's asking if we have anything in an XXXLXXXS.
OK, he's cute, but all he can sell is sweaters
He said his wife may trim back down to petite sizes. She's scheduled visits to the tanning booth.
People it’s okay to wear white after Labor Day.
Have you noticed the new guy is cold as ice and smells like a carrot?
Do you think there is something odd about the new employee? He keeps asking to go outside for a break every 15 minutes.
He folds clothes pretty well for seasonal help
Don't worry...with climate change the seasonal help is usually gone by noon.
The new floor walker is as cold as ice!
We’ll see how Mr. Magic Hat does when things heat up closer to Christmas.
It seems like these seasonal hires are here one day, gone the next.
He insists on keeping the thermostat at 0 degrees Celsius.
He's looking for something to keep the cold in
Chill, honey. He's just a seasonal temp.
I wonder how long this new seasonal worker is going to last.
I’d be surprised if the new temp makes it through the afternoon.
The snowman should be looking for pants, not shirts.
Oh....He's the new manager for "one size fits all"
Sure he's sweet, but trust me these seasonal guys never work out.
Linda, watch out for the new guy, he’s been staring me down with these stone cold eyes.
He’s got the seasonal in “Seasonal Employee” down cold.
He said he’s looking for smaller sizes, because the pounds supposedly just melt off him every spring
He says he's looking for a men's XXL, XL, L, M, S, and XS.
That naked guy with the funny nose gives me the shivers.
He said his friends tried online shopping, but they melted before their clothes arrived.
The seasonal hire keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
He doesn't know a thing about women's wear.
If he says I'm cold because I'm a woman one more time...
Do we have round-bottom pants?
I have to be honest, while I don't like the dripping after he's done browsing, at least there is someone in the store, thanks to online shopping.
I tried being friendly with the new guy, but he gave me the cold shoulder
Betty thinks he’s cool, but he sends shivers up and down my spine.
Definitely in climate-change denial.
One more crack like that and I'll march your jolly happy soul down to HR.
I don't think the new employee will make it through the summer.
We had one date but I just couldn't warm up to him.
Bezos is betting Frosty outlasts us.
Normally silk hats are against the dress code, but apparently he has some disability-related exemption.
I feel like the new manager is freezing me out.
That seasonal hire guy knows _nothing_ about fashion.
He's here every year, but he never buys any summer clothes.
He wants us to turn on the air conditioner.
The seasonal help they send us these days just don't seem to last.
For seasonal help, he's pretty cool, but the top hat is so yesterday.
Yeah he’s cool but I’m always worried he’s gonna have a big meltdown.
Caught him lowering the thermostat again.
I told him that if he waited till the summer, he will fit into the small size.
I don’t get too friendly with the seasonal hires. They’re gone forever before the Spring collection.
He totally chose the wrong field.
I tried to tell him his waistline puts him in the Big and Tall store!
Sorry, your new guy is so not cool.
Just once I'd like to look at Frosty fold.
He wants to know if they're pre-washed.
He just gives me the cold shoulder everytime I talk to him, and I'm tired of it.
Well, I don't think Winter Wednesday has a snowball's chance....
It lacks a human element.
There's no way those clothes will fit him by spring.
He claims just standing on a front lawn won't pay for his nose.
He's a real Snow Wear man!
Better file that harassment suit before spring.
Maybe she's right, top hats are in this year.
If he asks for a "pant" one more time, I'm going to split his lower ball down the middle!
I don't know why you keep hiring all these itenerant workers... I'm sure he'll be gone by March!
Do you really think he can keep his pants on?
Well, I'm freezing.
I hate these seasonal hires.
He never leaves that rack
I like the new employee. He's very chill.
Nice guy, but he's kinda cold.
He says he wants something that will keep him cold.
I'm working in mohair!
I think it’s a snow job, but he said that he just wants the buttons.
Biggest flake I’ve ever met.
You wait on Frosty. Will it be the Big Bird next?!
Don’t be fooled by that big, fake smile. He is the coldest co-worker on this floor.
I know he's our manager and could fire me but I think I'm going to tell him to put on some pants.
I keep getting frosty stares.
He wants cruise wear, extra large, and we're all out.
The new employee gives me the chills
They only want to know if the carrot is actually vegan!
I don't have the heart to tell him is carrot is so last season.
I don't like the new boss. He's as cold as ice.
His folding technique blows.
The new guy just flashed me!
I don't think he is going to last long in this job.
He's my mother's friend's cousin; nepotism, in hiring, yes; 1982's scarf museum called: I have to get him to return it.
I bet the new guy won't make it past Christmas
Don't worry about the new hire, he looks like he won't last long here
Keep your eye on the big flake!
He's surprising the wife and kids with a holiday trip to Florida.
At least his frosty attitude will melt with the spring collection.
Who is the new guy? That's Frosty; he's only seasonal help.
But he likes it when I give him the cold shoulder.
I'd report him but I'm afraid of coal in my stocking.
The seasonal workers leave when the Spring line arrives.
I guess the days of warm and fuzzy management are over in retail
This doesn't look good, Louise. He's looking for a Hawaii shirt and shorts in December.
The holiday help is exhausting. I get it, it's cold in here.
The holiday help is always so flaky.
How do I tell him those beach shirts are not for him?
Is it just me, or does that guy look like Frosty?
So, like, after they turned on the heat he told me he's going to have to quit soon, and like, I was really bummed, so then he said, "don't cry, I'll be back again one day."
Every time I try to talk to the new guy, he gives me the cold shoulder.
He’s looking for materials that shrink.
Hum... They're wrong, not everyone waits until end of season sales.
He's looking for something to match his scarf, with a cold front.
I don't know why, but he's always been a little frosty toward me.
Have you noticed our new seasonal employee is kind of frosty?
That customer certainly gave me a “frosty” reception!
All that dripping. . .It's his third headset.
It's easy for him to live on ten bucks an hour: he does not have to pay rent!
Ever since global warming, they have been taking all our jobs
I can't wait for spring. Captain Nose-it-all will be long gone by then.
I appreciate the extra hands, but I feel like this transfer from the North Pole keeps giving me the cold shoulder
Uhg, why is he here? It's only April!
He called me a snowflake because I criticized the President.
Maybe I need to look closer -- but sometimes it feels like the Holidays are one giant marketing campaign.
I keep trying to make friends with the new guy, but he always gives me the cold shoulder.
I heard that he's giving his customers the cold shoulder.
The new guy in men's wear has been so cold towards me.
That new sales associate gives me the chills.
I'll eat my hat if this latest hire lasts more than a day on the job.
Frosty tried to show his snowballs !
Don’t worry about your ex. He’ll be gone by spring.
Quick! Get him to try it on before he melts.
Sure he's happy -- they're freezing bonuses this year.
" He doesn't want anything too warm".
Seasonal employees can be so cold at times.
Don't bother talking to him, he is such a snowflake.
HR told me he is allowed to not wear clothes in the workplace for religious reasons.
He wants to put some smaller size clothes on lay away after he melts some weight off.
If he's still employed in March, he's lucky.
When robots take over our jobs, what do you suppose they’ll look like?
Don’t you think he’s taking this snowflake thing a bit far?
Is it just me, or are these seasonal workers Frosty?
The new salesperson keeps giving me icy glares.
Yeah, ever since his run for Senate began he started coming by in disguise...
Aren't warm cloths counterintuitive?
Seasonal sales helpers just can't stand the heat.
Wait a few minutes and then send him the children's department.
I’m sick and tired of Stan telling me to chill out.
I got him to stop smoking that corn cob pipe, but he’s being totally unreasonable about taking off the hat.
I'm guessing he's the new temp.
Seasonal employees are the worst at describing proper fit.
It's Uber's self-erasing seasonal worker.
After a day in the store, he lost a ton of weight. I asked but he doesn't want to tell me his secret. Jerk!
That seasonal help keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
The new guy’s got a very cold look about him. Gives me the shivers.
She’s actually complaining that she can’t keep the weight from melting away.
He says he'll only touch clothes that don't wick moisture away from the body.
I try to be nice, but he just gives me the cold shoulder.
I knew we were right to break out the winter sweaters today...
I will need an extra small in 20 minutes.
They say the tax bill will increase employment as early as the first snowfall.
He wants us to turn down the temperature.
Oh he's just temporary.He'll be gone by this spring.
The rack behind me is just in case a few pounds melt away.
Does management really think keeping this store so cold will attract customers?
It's way too early for such a jolly happy soul.
At least we don't have to worry about him lasting into the spring season
The new guy means well but customers find his cold demeanor off-putting.
He seems nice enough, but we don’t even sell clothes for old, fat, white guys.
Seasonal help! Let's see how long this one lasts.
I asked his inseam, and he asked me out for pie.
But the children say he can laugh and play, just the same as you and me, so why not play dress up?
The problem is that just when we need him most, Clearence Sales, he melts away
He says he is only into scarves and hats.
- Ugh, “holiday helper” , but can he gift wrap?
You’re right, Cindy, they’re unattractive and out of style: but they”ll be given as gifts.
Well, at least the new stock guy’s only a seasonal. He’s scheduled to melt after inventory and then we can turn the heat back on, thank god!
I still think customers want the clothes organized by size and not their thermal rating, but he's the boss.
Just ignore him! He’s here every year looking for something to keep him cold.
Her Seasonal Affective Disorder is really bad this year.
Yeah, he thinks he's so cool, but I've had worse managers.
He says he's in charge of accessories.
I turned the heating up. We won’t have to deal with him much longer!
He heard me dissing Trump in the break room, then he called me 'snowflake'.
Shouldn't seasonal temps get complimentary pants?
He may be a good salesperson, but he refuses to work during the holidays.
Frosty my ass; if he keeps singing “He’s Mr. Heat Miser” every time I walk by he’ll be the next front page firing.
He’s a jolly happy soul to work with alright, but he’s kind of cold with the customers.
I have called security. They know him!
...and, ever since he started processing payroll, my bank account ends up frozen twice a month.
There’s something about his personality... he’s just so cold.
He wants the same clothes in three different sizes.
He's the new temp. I can already see that he'll be underwater by noon.
I sure am glad these seasonal employees don't last long.
I asked him if he was looking for something to go with his scarf and he gave me the cold shoulder.
He's seasonal employee -- he won't be here very long.
Trans climate, trans whatever..., here it's just sales.
Holiday Temps come and they go.
And then I told him his hat makes his nose look big, but it's like he didn't carrot all.
He gave HR a snow job about 'looking the part' to boost holiday sales.
He is our company's diversity program new hire.
Hey Marge, if you turn up the heat, I'll get him a shirt that fits.
Isn’t the new holiday help just a little overdressed?” “He’s vying for our jobs.
He's just a seasonal hire, but he's such a jolly, happy soul that the customers love him.
Why is it every time we’re short staffed they send in Bob? Last week the holiday crowds were so rough he melted under pressure.
Do we carry a size 'bulky' for his girlfriend? She'll be built tomorrow.
Thank God he's seasonal.
I like it when they bring on the seasonal staff. Frosty over there is a chill dude.
He's looking for a something with a carrot motif.
Geez, Louise, snowmen are so fucking rude.
The new guy is pretty quiet, but he seems like a jolly happy soul.
If I were him I would have used my employee discount and brought some actual clothes.
Mr. Snowman there wants to buy a coat.
thank God for migrant holiday help - put them by the outside door and they never complain
I thought "When they placed it on his head he began to dance around," not replace Merv in Mens' Accessories.
I told HR we needed a warm body and this is what we got...
He's a snow Man for God's sake. He doesn't need to shop in the women's department.
I don't care. He has to wait 90 days to get the associate's discount too.
He claims to have had something called a 'made for Television Special ' like a half-century ago. Whatever, just let me know when you have a series on Netflix.
He’s hoping to lose a little weight by spring.
Now I know how Hillary Clinton fest during that presidential debate.
By April, he will be able to buy off the rack.
He wants to know which color palate will best complement a very pale complexion.
I might ask him out, but I fear I'll get the cold shoulder.
Training the new seasonal employees is impossible. Its like they were rolled yesterday!
he's such an optimist.
He's OK. But I am getting tired of his frosty demeanor.
Snowy and his brother Drifty are the best winter salespeople we ever had.
Don’t let him try on any underwear.
Why did management hire him? He won't last, you know.
I told him to skip the pants section.
Turn the heating on and we'll soon have his size.
He gets "Chill" breaks that last for hours.
Seasonal help never lasts.
I'm down with our seasonal help, but if Mr. Jolly over there says one more time that he just loves trimming the clothing tree, I swear...
He keeps telling me I'm hot when I'm cold.
He tries to return everything in the spring for a smaller size.
I guess there actually was some magic in that old silk hat.
Don't hate me, but despite all this crass consumerism, I still find this holiday season magical.
He goes outside every hour and smokes a pipe!
If he tells me about the ‘magic’ in his old satin hat again, I’m going straight to the media.
Extra large, but able to shrink.
Like I said - all the wold loves plaid.
I'm not sure, Doc. I misplaced my "honey do" list and felt a sharp pain in my back while looking for it.
Listen! I think I heard a bark!
I swear he's talking to us...Must be that old silk hat he wears
Don't let this guy snow you.
... and yesterday he dropped a sweater on the floor and just, like, left it there.
I think that snowman is stalking us. I'm going to turn the heat up.
Do we still have those heated throws?
It keeps reminding me that it's White Wednesday.
I asked if he needed help, but he gave me the cold shoulder
You get his attention and I'll grab his magic hat.
We call him the, “lawn man”. That’s the only place we ever see him.
It’s freezing in here.
The scarf covers nothing. I demand he put on some pants.
I can remember when we didn't get the bargain hunters until after Thanksgiving.
Frosty's clothes keep everyone toasty.
I think the hats and scarves section is a better fit than sweaters!
They don't shop online.
I guess Santa's fashion adviser is going for a complete rethink
His nose may be organic, but his eyes are staring with nonrenewable fossil fuel.
He's new to the job so we better give him some time to chill out.
Thanks to global warming, he’s finally achieved that beach body.
He takes that hat-makes-the-man cliche to a whole new level.
He says, "Do you have any styles that'll stay cool all summer long."
He says getting the right fit is challenging. This is his winter weight and every spring he trims down to nothing.
Maybe we should turn the air-conditioning off
Yeah. Well don't lick the hangers or you will get stuck.
What's the PC way to suggest that he shop in Big &Tall?
All he keeps saying is, 'Are you married? Are you married?' Worse than my mother!!
Overtime, overtime! He has such a cold heart.
Don't bother with that one. He'll just disappear after he's had his fun with you.
He's the new window dresser from the Buffalo store; they call him "Frosty" but he's actually pretty nice.
He’s a temp for the winter sale.
Why on ear has would he be buying summer clothes.
He wants a pair of pants, but he won't give me his inseam.
Don't worry, he's just a temp.
Don’t worry, the temps all disappear after the Christmas rush.
He doesn't need any help. He's "chill".
He told me he's been chosen to appear in a dance contest.
He’s looking for something flattering to his figure.
It's Matt Lauer thinly disguised, again, Savannah.
Not to discriminate, but I'm frustrated with how cold we have to keep it in here now.
Give me a hand before he melts..
And then he asked to see the ball gowns!
Maybe you should try wearing the hat.
It was a really cold night to be standing in line!
After the cold shoulder, I said, “Suit yourself.”
After suffering a classic case of holiday fatigue, Frosty made a bold career move to the Gap...
That jerk asked if he could melt a little bit in front of me.
...What?!? If it wasn’t for this administration, he wouldn’t even be able to SEE the words Climate Change.
And they always try to return them before spring
A size eight today but a double-zero by the weekend.
Seasonal hiring is so chill this year.
He’s part-time seasonal
Isn't his style a little dated for H&M? I like the scarf, but that hat looks like something out of a Burl Ives song.
Okay, okay, I'll turn up the heat.
Well, it DOES make her look fat.
You would think a seasonal hire wouldn't be so cold.
Snow White privilege is really something we need to change. Yang would be a much better manager than that pile of snow.
If he's such a jolly-old-soul, why are we working overtime?
Sure, he's a great worker, but I'm sick of fighting over the thermostat.
He sure can sing, but he falls apart on the dance floor.
I wouldn't call her shy, she is glacial!
He's a nice guy, but every shirt he tries on has to be dried after.
He wants to know if we have anything waterproof.....
I don’t know how those two work on Black Friday. I’m going to have a meltdown
He's the worst with his corncob pipe breaks every 15 minutes!
Do we really want a sales clerk who has no ears?
No pockets means no cash means no sale - turn up the heat
Can we ditch him? He's sniveling carrot juice all over the cashmeres.
There's something about that guy that gives me the chills.
That's the aspirational rack.
Given today’s climate, I’m a little worried about that nose.
He plans to be slimmer come spring.
Tell him to stop putting the small scarves with the medium shirts with the large pants.
I hear the Secret Service are looking for new disguises.
He asked for a transfer. Santa's sweatshop almost killed him.
He'd like to see what's still available from the winter collection.
Turn up the heat. We have a shoplifter.
There are larger sizes upon request.
Ugh. I just can’t believe he wears that top hat to work.
I think he's more puddle than predator.
Sales clerk is a rough gig. We'll see how long new boy back there can take the heat.
The new guy sure does have sticky hands.
The earth has to be close to freezing completely when a snowman needs a coat.
He has really got great spirit for a Temp.
He's only buys Frozen-themed merchandise.
Any of you b*tches get laid last night?
Santa gets fired for sexual assault, and they replace him with this guy parading around in nothing but a scarf?
Excuse me - could you direct us to hats, scarves and produce?
He got the promotion because he's a man.
Sure he's not my type, but he's rather taken a fancy to you.
He thinks the bottomless look will catch on.
Do we have anything more jolly?
I'm happy to have the holiday help - but he keeps buying all the outsize clothing for himself.
He wants to know if we have any of the snowpants left?
Come spring, you two will still be here. I’ll be out watering lawns.
He wants something to keep him cold
He spends half of the day posing for selfies.
He's bound to have a meltdown.
The customers say he's jolly and happy, but to me he just comes across as frosty.
I think I need a good icebreaker
Sure he outsells me, but does he have to be so jolly about it?
I don't like the way he looks at me. May I turn up the thermostat?
I tried to tell him that a 3-X won't fit a 3-0.
He showed up. Usually, he's super flaky.
Can’t he tell those are so last season?
He said 'Catch me if you can.' I wish he was a little more frosty.
We recruited her from a yard sale.
It's that time of year. Their arms and legs should start falling off soon.
This isn't funny, you know.
Oh, hi Ceasar. No, Brutus isn't here, but he left a message for you.
With Frosty the Snowman gathering data, too, sure skews our gender base.
He comes but once a year.
You just know he'll be back on Christmas Day.
How come Frosty gets to sell the ugly Christmas sweaters?
He's a snob who thinks style and fashion are the same thing.
I wouldn't worry about that new sales clerk taking your job; he's just a seasonal worker.
I don't know why we hire seasonal help that can't even fit into our clothes.
So I told corporate to take the stick out their ass and shove it up their nose...
You think that scarf will make my hips look that big too?
A jolly happy soul? It's the carrot you gotta watch.
...like, stop trying so hard
Every time it gets a little busy around here, the new guy just melts.
Seasonal workers freak me out.
He wants to see matching pants.
I don't care how great he is for sales. If he lays his cold branches on me again I'm going public!
If he pokes me one more time...
The thermostat broke a week ago; he won’t last here.
I wish I could be more open-minded, but I think he has a rather chilling effect on both me and our customers.
I just got sexually harassed by Mr. Frost. He said "I don't have anything on under this scarf!"
Well, after Black Friday, are we ready for the Christmas sales ladies???
Don't you hate seasonal staff?
You know how it is with seasonal help. They're here for a few weeks, and then they melt away.
He says he has gained weight and needs a larger size.
Dress code is Button Nose.
Yea, he's a very organized employee, but everywhere he goes he leaves wet spots on the carpets.
Customers are complaining the garments are moist
This takes seasonal help to a whole new level.
Tk tk tk....TK!
Hi honey, do you know where we put the new health care premium notices?
He won’t make it through the fire sale!
I'm thinking it might be time to move on
www
My day at the White House? Nothing unusual, went on as always .....
I think the new clerk is kind of frigid.
Apparently my attitude wasn't 'frosty' enough.
He asked me what I think of snowballs.
This! ... is our extra help for the holiday season?
If one more customer emerges from the fitting room sans pants, I'm quitting.
Yes, he's been a seasonal worker here before but often have a frosty attitude.
I try to be friendly, but he keeps giving me the cold shoulder...
That new guy is never going to last.
I thought it was kept cold in here to increase sales!
Listen, nobody like to buy what a fat white guy is buying so can you get the guy behind me out of the store?
He is very cold to our customers
Can you believe she's checking the petites rack? She must think those extra pounds are just going to melt off!
Every year he asks for limitless alterations.
Do we have anything for a linoleum block print of a snowman?
Says he needs help seeing the patterns since the EPA insisted he get new eyes.
He'll only last through the season.
I kicked him in the ball.
I have plenty of holiday spirit. Does he only know how to hum the one song?
He said I'd do better if I wasn't so frosty with the customers. Where it the thermostat?
How would be easier to work with if his demeanor weren't so frosty.
When I placed on his head he didn't dance around!
Every time I think I'm making progress with a guy, I get the cold shoulder!
He only buys Kenneth Coal.
Snowballs...
Well Cindy, when they said they were hiring holiday help I didn’t think this is what they ment!
He missed the train to the North Pole. This was his backup plan.
I hate seasonal help
Hate her attitude. Let's turn the heater up.
It's hard to keep good help these days.
Are you sure this shirt will be warm enough? (Doesn't ask the snowman)
He’s always been frosty to me, too!
Look, if it's too tight, tell him to come back when it's a little warmer out.
I'm sure he thinks that whimsical top hat will get him extra points, but trust me, it's strictly seasonal.
I think freezing his assets was the wrong strategy.
don't be frosty - you're melting my heart!
I've got to give it to the new manager...there must be some magic in those old silk hats he suggested we put on sale!
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found. For when they placed it on his head, he began to sell women's clothing.
I'm going to report him for sexual harassment if he doesn't start wearing pants.
Seasonal employees are always so counterproductive!
It's not fair. Why doesn't he have to wear these hideous uniforms?
The tabloids are gonna love this. Frosty keeps leering at me saying "Thumpity, thump, thump.'
Hello, 1950 called and it wants its silk hat back.
I don't care that he is a happy jolly soul, his sales techniques are all wet!
That new manager asked me if I knew what the size of his nose meant.
Don't worry, he'll be gone by spring.
They cant afford to turn up the heat
He just stands there doing nothing.
He's doing it wrong but try and correct those seasonal employees -- they just melt.
He's a seasonal specialist.
He says he wants a smaller size- he claims the inches are going to start melting away in just a few weeks......
Let's just turn up the heat.
He really should have been assigned to the outerwear department.
This customer behind me wants to know if we have any sales on snow shoes.
Yet another 'seasonal employee' from Human Resources, Irene, but don't worry - he won't last the weekend.
Should we tell him that's the spring collection?
I'd say something about the seasonal help being here only through winter, but that would be obvious.
I know this guy. He'll bring it back four or five times, and say it's too big.
He only paused a moment when he heard me holler "Backup on Cash".
He's asking about his inseam.
He says he's the owner's nephew.
He jabbed me with his carrot in the break room.
Don't get me wrong, I love Frosty. I just wish he didn't melt at the end of every shift!
I wish he would stop dripping on the floor.
The new boss seems very cold but how long can he last?
Don’t look now, but that shoplifter is back.
Don't mind him, he's a seasonal worker.
He wants a waterproof sweater.
The holiday hire is getting on my nerves.
How come he's always so cool while restocking?
He's a seasonal employee--he'll just melt away once it's hot.
He thinks a feigned interest in female fashion isn't the ogler's big 'tell.'
He's been giving me that cold stare all morning. I'm going to have to tell HR.
With that hat and scarf ? He'll be gone by spring.
I hate to work in our north pole branch. You can’t have a hot sale without losing your customer.
He wants to know when the Winter Clearance Sale begins.
Customers are complaining about his icy demeanor.
It's almost closing time... turn up the thermostat a few degrees.
Who's the new seasonal employee?
Did you see the pool of water in the stockroom?
The new guy is still giving me the cold shoulder!
You realize, don’t you, that these new hires are just an excuse to keep the temperature low?
He wants to know if we have xtra, xtra, large's in stock.
That customer keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
I told him to look on the moisture-wicking clothing rack.
Why must we lower the temperature so a Snowman can work in the women's department?
Don't offer to help. He's obviously just playing it cool. Nice guy just came in. Very cool customer.
The new guys is so cold
Holly Jolly my ass
So things got a little crazy at the holiday party last night and I hooked up with one of the seasonal employees...is he looking over here?
I don't have the heart to tell him that I don't recommend springware.
He says he has no sweat glands, but needs sportswear that will absorb melting.
He'll melt and then we can split the carrot.
The carrot is probable a camera!
#MeToo
The seasonal help never has any fashion sense.
They like to keep it drafty around here to appease the seasonal help.
The smiling silent type really works for me.
The seasonal help will melt away soon enough.
Of course he's voting to turn down the thermostat. Doh!
Go green. Grow together.
His Account is Frozen
Maybe you should offer to show him the winter selections...
The seasonal help just gave me the cold shoulder
These new employee diversity hiring guidelines are really getting out of hand.
I caught Jack nipping at her clothes in the break room.
We had to hire some outside help for the season.
Do I report him to HR or just wait for spring?
I try and I try. But she's just so cold.
The new salesperson seems a little cold.
No,I am NOT paranoid!
Did you meet our new Winter Intern?
I'm not sure we have anything that complements her shape.
It's freezing in here since he was hired.
He gets a freezer break every thirty minutes.
Did you just call me, hot?
Do they get marked down if they get wet ?
He just gave me the coldest shoulder!
I see HR's loosened up on the trans-species hiring.
What should I do? He's asking about the spring line.
I know he identifies as human, but can we at least keep him away from the sweaters? Those are cashmere for god's sake.
He’s a good worker until sales heat up.
He's a great worker but a little cold with the customers.
He wants to know if we carry myrrh.
He says he's shopping for his girlfriend, but more to the point, how did he get in here?
I understand they're hiring some seasonal employees to help out this time of year.
Yeah, I am happy too that the new guy isn't a grabber, but he is kind of cold.
Some customers are so cold.
Ugh, his sales are killing us with that signature line, "Oh, you should definitely get the smaller size. That holiday weight is just going to melt right off".
We get it, you're a seasonal employee.
He was hoping to find an Untuckit.
Hey, what's this carrot doing in this shirt?
It's to enhance his image of looking cool.
Daily deals bring in the strangest of customers.
Might be a short winter after all.
If sales stay this hot, she won’t be around much longer.
These seasonal employees come in year after year and try to steal our commission.
Black Friday was very snowy this year
He can’t take it when sales heat up.
He'll be gone by the spring.
He’s married.
Should we tell him that the Spring collection would better set off his complexion?
He comes in every year at this time, but he never buys anything.
...but what really irks me is that the seasonal help is always so cheerful.
What do you mean call security? He is security!!
I can't believe he showed up to work naked.....again
Could we turn the heat on?
Wonder what size he wears.
Does he really think anything off the rack will fit?
Temp works have no loyalty...he'll be out of here with the fire sale.
For Christmas, I'd like a heat wave.
For a guy who only has one hat in his wardrobe, I’m surprised Frosty has such an eye for styling.
Just because Frosty is a seasonal worker doesn't mean he shouldn't have to fold too...
Frosty's back. Hot. Cold. Wet. Dry. Tough guy to satisfy.
Is it cold in here or what?
Sure have been some frosty customers lately.
He’s high maintenance but complies with all immigration laws.
She started after the hiring freeze
Do you think Frosty is picking out a gift for Rudolph?
I don't care how famous he is, he can't wear the pants here.
So after the 3rd guy was fired for harassment, they figured snowmen were a safer bet.
I predict this new guy will be gone by spring.
Don't worry, his sales will melt away once the spring line comes in.
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat you found.
He's looking for pants with zero inseam
Yeah, so, the Easter Bunny stole his whole ‘thumpity-thump-thump’ gig, and now he just really needs the work ...
He’s got the look, but he tends to be a bit icy towards customers
I just don't like the new guy. He just seems a little frosty.
If he doesn't have any snowballs, he's in the wrong department.
This time you clean up the dressing room.
hate to be a killjoy, but what I see is a big hat, a scarf, and a bucket of slush
The new guy told me I needed to chill.
He's cool, but he won't last six months.
Do you think he'll last until the summer?
Yes, yes, I know. The weather outside is frightful...even for him!
Ignore him, and he'll melt away. Then, I get the scarf, you get the hat.
They were just being mean. His nose is not that big.
I told him about the 'Big Man's' store around the corner, but he hasn't taken the hint.
Look who's working Last Act....He says he's got a Magic Hat, but I'm not sure about that thumpety thump, thump and "catch me if you can" spiel...
When you see them you want to fall; when I see them I want to weep.
He’s here today, thumpity-thump-thump gone tomorrow.
Senator Franken here. Is it too late to apologize?
That's OK , he's cool!
If he asks me out one more time...I’m yanking off the buttons he can’t replace!
He's looking for a gift for a very hot young girl.
I'm going on break.
He says he wants something that will keep him cold.
He says he's not interested in any hot deals. And he wants to know if we have any frozen assets he can peruse.
I'm all for gender equality in the workplace - but this is really going too far.
Good luck. We sold most of our snow suits before Labor Day.
The new manager keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
I told you outdoor advertising wasn't the best idea when looking for seasonal help!
He put his hand on my ass.
He's a temp worker.
I asked the new guy to layer sweaters and he went to the boss claiming ADA violations.
Think its tough selling him a shirt? Try selling him pants.
Trust me. You won’t thaw to him.
I think the new guy's a little cold.
He's seasonal. He'll be here for the next few weeks barring no major climatic event.
I'm sorry no more 'Me-too#'s' left.
Is it me or did it just get really cold in here?
He says he's cold.
He's new in sales, but I predict he won't last long.
Your turn to follow him around with mop.
wait until he pays for his purchase,then turn up the thermostat.
Have you met our new seasonal employee?
We were just having some fun.
He says he's looking for something for Mrs. Snowman. She gets cold being outside all the time.
Seasonal workers get flakier every year.
He waved goodbye and I didn't cry. His"some day" is apparently today.
The seasonal guy is giving me the cold shoulder
He looks through all the racks but always buys the same hat and scarf.
The new guy's giving me the cold shoulder.
Yes, I get your point.
At least she'll be gone by spring.
Our New Christmas Temp Just Leaves Me Cold
These seasonal workers have no motivation to learn the job properly.
Just when you thought white people couldnt get any colder.
He just stands behind the display rack asking people if they want to see his snowballs.
What goes well with white?
It gets tougher every year to find good seasonal help.
Would it be kind to tell Miss Winter about the 40% discount Christmas Temps get?
He’s not wearing pants. I’m going to #metoo the freak.
I think he's shoplifting stuff. Did he come in with that earpiece?
Just like new winter clothes at bargain basement prices.
I feel like telling Frosty to buy something or just melt away.
Frost T. He's way cool, and the best wrapper here.
What do we have in winter white?
Frosty is quite the jolly worker." "I agree; too bad he's going to miss our spring collection
He's a seasonal worker. Come New Year's. Swish. He's gone.
The new guy gives me the chills. He'll be gone by Spring.
New guy isn’t going to last here too long.
Don't worry: His career will be limited
He's back. He keeps returning stuff.
Another holiday temp who won't last a day . . .
He dresses great now but used to wear the same stinky yellow socks to work every day when he owned a dog.
Do you have tall and curvy fashions?
He'll never find a shirt that fits. The 3XL rack is at the other end of the floor.
He's waiting for the winter clearance.
We’re lucky the clearence sale is in February
You call him Frosty, I call him a stalker.
All I get is a chilly stare.
Yes, last week I sold a black top hat to Matt Lauer. Why?
He's just helping during Christmas, very short-term.
Ugh, it's so hard to find good seasonal employees.
That seasonal hire guy was super frosty with me when I asked him to iron the shirts.
I don't think I'll ever warm up to the new guy... He never wears any pants!
The new guy thinks the shoes are spelled Coal Hahn.
He said it's too cold to work outside.
I really think our new store detective will go unnoticed this year.
She said that I’d make a great Grinch.
He's seasonal management.
I've already been reduced to nothing. What more do you want?
If that new hire doesn’t stop putting clothes on the wrong rack, I’m going to have a meltdown.
Was there something I was supposed to get at the store?
There may be magic in that old silk hat, but I still say his sales techniques are questionable.
I forgot what I was going to say
Tell her that yes the 'your fault' divorce papers have been served.
The winter help rolls in earlier every year
If it's not the "Color of the Year," we're not interested.
The Unbearable Lightness of Being
The Invisible Man: Anniversary Edition
It's your turn to mop the break room again.
Everyday he works we have to turn down the heat and can't talk about spring break in Florida!
He always comes to the bargain rack then melts away without buying anything.
the female is attracted to a male with larger square patterns for mateing but eats them once she is pregnant, they dont serve much perpose after that
He asked to turn off the heat.
He says he can only stay in the store for a few minutes
If he pokes me one more time, I'm telling the manager.
Okay, but you better hope the AC doesn’t go on the fritz again....
I think what this particular gentleman needs is a skirt.
I asked him if he needed help and he gave me the cold shoulder!
He needs to take his wife to Florida for a few hours.
He told us he was tired of yard sales.
Don't make eye contact - he's been banned from the mall.
Says he wants to be the best dressed in the city.
He says the pants are always to tight in the butt.
He comes in every year looking for something for a one night stand.
I don't like the way he undresses me with his coal.
He touched me inappropriately.
The seasonal sales associate is a jolly, happy soul
''He claims to melt at the sight of me."
Don't worry he will be gone by summer.
I don't know about our new sales associate. He gives everyone a frosty reception.
The holiday temp says he'll take the long shifts because he doesn't get sore feet.
Yes, she did leave a list of complaints before she moved out.
He asked for a large, but by the time he pays and leaves he'll be a small.
He could sell ice cubes to Eskimos.
He's in our new climate change job retraining program.
We are already getting ready for the spring display.
Do we still stock larger size snowsuits?
I am getting SO tired of mopping up after him six times a day.
Wonder how long this one can last...
Is that creepy guy with the long orange nose still lurking behind the clothes rack?
That new sales associate has been giving me the cold shoulder all day.
I hate the customers who undress me with their charcoal
He's one of the seasonal hires.
We don't have waterproof pants in his size do we?
He's just a seasonal employee.
When the name tag and head mic are upon the snowman, Christmas is nigh.
People sure are afraid of looking stupid.
The new guy’ personality is really frosty.
Seasonal help...Ugh!!! I wish I was a jolly happy soul.
These seasonal workers are so annoying!
He’s asked me out a couple of times...whenever I mention Rhinoplasty, he just stares at me with those creepy eyes. I can’t...I just can’t.
The seasonal help seems nice.
He wants to know what we have in a wintery mix-and-match.
Do you think snowman is selling better this year?
I heard there was a shortage of seasonal workers - but he just won't last
What's he going to do when everything is 70% off....
That new guy will be gone in no time.
That new holiday helper has been a little frosty.
He thinks the sweater was a little tight, but it should fit better in the spring.
Seriously! They Hired Another Millennial Snowman as our CEO?
Ignore him. He's a looker, not a shopper.
Well Rob, just because we have great chemistry doesn’t mean we ought to tie the knot.
Diversity. Our staff was lacking an almost naked guy.
The thing I'm dreading is next week they're bringing in reindeer to re-stock the displays.
I TOLD HIM CHILL!!
He wants fashionable winter clothes that will keep him cold.
He looks soft for a cold hard salesman.
I think he’s just a seasonal hire.
I bet he won't last three months here.
The new salesman just asked me to join him for a couple of snowball daiquiris after work.
Don't get me wrong, I like Frosty, but he's been here since the middle of October, and by now, I'm sick of the sight of him!
Our new manager has been giving me chilly looks all day
This guy is giving me the chills.
He wants to know if we have moo-moos.
Says he's too hot, wants a bikini.
He think it'll fit when his post-holiday diet kicks in.
He seems to take the work pretty seriously for a seasonal employee.
I keep telling you - you've got to know when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em!!
I heard him say my cake from the holiday party tasted like boogers; it was carrot cake...
I know we are in a retail ice age, but I still don't think we have any pants that will fit him.
Anyone who can't wear pants to work will be in the gutter by spring.
He claims he got a chilly reception because he's a seasonal employee.
There's nothing I can do about the heat, we can't afford to be short staffed this season.
He's looking for something unshrinkable.
Here’s a “me-too story, Lydia, I’ve seen his snow balls.”
Quick, see what he needs. They just turned the heat up.
The poor guy only has four months to live
He's not responding. I think his headset has iced over again.
He’s REALLY a temporary holiday worker.
Sweaty and fat.
Why does he come in each year and look at the Spring Collection? Don't worry they're waterproof.
I heard he’s working here until he melts.
Really wish the new guy would put some pants on...
I hate it when he checks me out under the false pretense of shopping for a new scarf.
These seasonal workers are so annoying!
We're hoping he can work the whole season, but you know how changeable the weather is.
So, I told him I worked HERE and that was that
Funny, he’s always here to Christmas shop and we sometimes see him on Valentines Day. I wonder where he shops all summer?
Why do the snowmen always control the thermostat?
Do we take frostbit coin?
Frosty's cool - but don't expect a long=term relationship.
Do you know who Professor Hinkle is?
Next magic hat goes on the Matthew McConaughey cutout in menswear.
if he gets the same discount I do, why don't you tell him to buy some fucking clothes? his other carrot's hanging out and touching all the cardigans
The trouble with seasonal help is the potential for melt downs.
It's not worth it. He's seasonal.
He always show up just in time for the summer sale.
Does that scarf protect him... or us?
Do we have winter wear that protects against warming temperatures?
I hate the holidays. Now that he's tried on everything he says he's shopping for his wife." I know it is late, but my suggestion for last week's contest: "I think I've just been served with a complaint for sexual harassment.
He wants something nice--I mean ice--to wear.
Just so we all agree this is not consensual cashmere . . .this is groping gabardine
He only comes in for the off-season sales.
How did he even get in here?, Shouldn't he have melted at the door" "Well, I heard it was Christmas magic that's sustaining him
He is always looking for accessories for that black top hat he found.
The new sales associate keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
He's only here for the season.
Keep folding. If you ask for a hanger, he'll show you his other carrot.
But management told me that I didn’t have a snowball’s chance for a promotion.
Watch out... his meltdown is a seasonal affair.
Relax, he's only here 'til Summer.
Who cares? I can give the shoulder too
He's one of the seasonal temps. By the way, could you bump the thermostat up a bit?
The seasonal help just told me I'm the one who's frosty.
These seasonal temps are always so cold to the rest of us.
He thinks, next year, he wants to be "Mrs. Snow-man"
Frosty is man-ing the price freeze items~
That new guy was really frosty to me.
Keep an eye on the seasonal employee for shrinkage.
The new anti-harassment training program seems to be working.
He actually prefers outside sales.
If they're so good for cold weather, why isn't HE wearing them?
I heard from management that Jack's been having issues with meltdowns. Not sure he'll make it after the holiday season.
During our breaks his corncob pipe has to go.
I think the new guy is cool.
I can't stand the seasonal temps.
I keep telling him nothing will fit until he thaws, but what do I know?
Reverse discrimination strikes again.
He put on that old silk hat, and began to dance around.
I just can't warm up to the new guy." "Relax Denise, he's just a seasonal employee.
This year's seasonal employee is going to have a meltdown
snowman thinks hes so cool for not needing a clothing folding machine
This seasonal help is driving me crazy! Now he's whistling "Frosty The Snowman!"
Wait 'till the heating system gets repaired...
The new guy is pretty cold" "Don't worry, he's just here for the season
I think he's only working here temporarily.
He's looking for a waterproof version.
He's getting a frosty reception at Corperate.
I hope the new temp they hired last through the Christmas sale.
Turn up the heat and he'll disappear.
He said he knows a way to melt off pounds.
Jolly happy soul my ass.
He knows why he's getting a frosty reception from me
Don't worry, he's just a temp.
Do you have anything in the way of magic realism?
I think he'd fit in better in seasonal apparel.
The seasonal help is so damn jolly happy.
He's still having trouble grasping the concept of folding pants.
Whose job description includes wiping up yellow puddles?
It's your turn to clean the men's room.
I think it's the beady eyes that give me the chills.
I told him the winter items aren't out yet.
He's looking for something really cool.
caption for the"guy" om the phome....Yes I'm a robot,but I have a mind of my own,no AI
It's really something. I've never seen anyone buy this much cruisewear.
I'm betting our extra staff will just melt away after the Holidays!
Checked his credit card. He's not Frosty. No corncob pipe, and no button nose!
None of this is going to last.
If he sings that 'I'll Melt With You' song to us one more time...
Needs this job with little snow balls home to raise.
Is this my size? I’m planning on losing some weight!
Well, this is only a seasonal job for me too.
"Is it just me, or is our Manager being a bit 'Frosty' this morning"?
I hope he finds a new job before the Valentine's Day Fire Sale.
He's promoting the cold shoulder look.
I'm so sick of these seasonal employees...
He transferred from our flagship store up north. I don't think he'll last till Spring.
He wants a shirt that breathes.
Does it feel frosty in here today?
Don't you think it's a little early to put out the "Don't you think it's a little early to put out the Spring collection?
He wants to know if we can sell him a pair of legs along with the pants.
He is really good for having stick arms but he keeps wanting to freeze our prices.
Yeah, I broke it off with him. He's got a cold heart.
I thought global warming was going to eliminate the temps.
I bet he'll melt in tears before his shift is over.
"I love Frosty's management style, but does he have to keep it so cold in here?
Working with seasonal help is not cool.
Don't pay him any mind, he says it's his birthday everyday.
If he melts off a few pounds we may have something that'll fit him.
He's the store walker, in Spring he'll be an Easter Rabbit.
He says his name is Frosty - and for us it's only $30 a gram - plus a few cover ups.
He gave me the cold shoulder again, and I think he has a bladder control problem.
He slides over here from Christmas decorations every day to check out the sale rack, hoping to find something that fits.
Is this sexual harrassment? He shows up with no pants and wants me to help him find a pair!
I wore that same thing last week, and nobody said anything!
It's Tony from the northern unit. Give him the cold shoulder, he loves it!
Have you ever noticed how frosty he gets with the customers?
Hello, Martin. About posting those indulgnces...
Just be thankful that he doesn't have a penis.
He insists he can't find anything suitable online.
That New Guy Frosty has quite a booty!
Pity nobody told him we push the Spring line this quarter.
I don't know about you, but the new guy gives me the chills.
Personally, I think the new delivery drone is a bit creepy.
Don't worry, the new guy will be gone by springtime.
He's impossible to warm up to.
If he sniffs my crotch one more time...
We'll see if his charm lasts until the spring lineup.
2016 called, it wants the snowman back.
Sssh. Marked down prices are really regular prices.
Yeah he's nice, but a bit sensitive about our "Fire Sale" promotion.
It's 70 degrees so he won't be around to get paid.
I guess our boss figured out a way to find temporary associates during the snow storm.
Thanks to him, Human Resources wants everyone to be a jolly, happy soul.
?I've had enough of his sexual misconduct. Frosty's name's getting added to the list!
Should I cut the ambien or ask them to raise the temp?
Just keep him away from the cashmere and we should be fine.
This neighborhood’s gotten so white.
You know, that fat SOB just put his chilly paw on my bum!
I don't think three turtleneck will work.
They're great workers, but when spring comes and it's time for them to go, things get pretty messy.
Nothing too warm. He doesn't like to sweat.
The new shop assistant keeps giving me frosty glares.
Based on 33 degrees of separation, he'll be a puddle by lunchtime.
I know we're not supposed to date them, but this one is so hot.
Do you find the seasonal help a bit cold this year?
Why should I help him? He just gave me the cold shoulder.
Harvey’s anxiety has spiked since the arrival of the Spring Collection. What a snowflake.
Steer clear of Frosty The Gropeman.
How long you do you give the new guy?
What can we do? He absolutely refuses to stop freezing customers accounts!
It’s the new seasonal hiring strategy, the manager said he likely won’t last past March.
This new guy has been pretty cold.
Frankly, this season's selection leaves me cold.
Oh, just ignore him, Becky. He's only seasonal.
Our seasonal help is having a hard time warming up to customers.
He says he slims down to a size zero as soon as the winter ends.
They said they're not going to investigate because he's a temp.
Don't mind him. He's just chillin'.
I was told he is paid by the minute
We're all busy. I'm just not going to put up with a meltdown.
He wants to know if we have any tops that shrink in the sunlight.
He's looking for a size 18. It's a gift for his wife who's in Florida. He said he stays behind because he can't take the heat.
I heard the guy that did that display is in a mental institution.
Yeah Yeah,,, when his majesty finishes the inspection...
He’ll probably be gone by the time the Spring line comes out.
I think he's a government spy.
The new temp that HR hired today...a bit flaky if you ask me
As he melts he needs to be refitted.
I'd better turn down the thermostat in the fitting rooms.
Yeah, I guess he's cute, but he's a little frosty.
He's too pale. We better take him to go a tanning salon.
I hear Frosty’s next- the flashing is getting old.
He's looking for something to keep him warm.
When he was much younger he showed me just what he needed covered by a longer scarf.
Seasonal help is so flaky!
He’s our new manager. Under the new federal affirmative action he got the highest score. It doesn’t even matter if they are made of snow.
Our new seasonal salesman just works four-hour shifts because he says he can’t stand being inside any longer.
He thinks he's gonna find one with Snowperson on it!
Look, he's back for the season--and probably to say hello to Rudolph.
Idios mios! ICE is here!
Actually I now know Luther missed the door.
I know it’s unusual, but we really need the seasonal help and there weren’t any H-2B visa applicants this year.
I know i pinned that note somewhere close.
Do you see anything? I don't see anything.
Why did Autumn fall for that rake? I hope she leaves him!
Watch out. He'll do a snow job on you.
The jolly happy soul HR requirement has gone too far this season.
T’is the Season...for sexism.
These seasonal workers are getting to be ridiculous.
He keeps staring at me with those coal eyes.
Forget about him, he’s just a lookie loo.
move it to the left or is it the right ?
Don't worry about him. He won't be around much longer.
I'm fine with hiring diversity, but everything he touches needs to be dried!
Yes, our diversity policy includes seasonal employees.
Watch my six. War on Christmas operatives have infiltrated.
I don't know, maybe I'm just being paranoid.
He waved goodbye saying 'don't you cry, I'll be back on Christmas Day' to pick up the new birthday suit..."
Another seasonal worker. Any bets on how long he lasts?
The new guy is so emotional, I told him to take a coffee break and he turned into a puddle.
Sure, he knows hats and scarves, but working in freezing conditions is inhumane!
I can't believe they keep letting him work here every Christmas without a button nose.
Can we turn the heat back on now?
I recommended the Trump trousers but he didn't appreciate my humor.
When he first came in, he had legs.
Cold clammy handshake, and he wets the changing room floor.
Say what you will, the man knows cold.
Something from Burrberry..?
Floorwalker, schmlore-walker! He's just ice with a carrot nose.
He won't last in here. Let's turn the heat up.
To get him to work you need some carrots and some sticks.
He'll grow out of any size we sell him.
If it gets any busier over the holidays, I hear that Management is pulling the Easter Bunny out of storage. Apparently, he doesn't mind working the night shift.
He won't last here long.
If he sings "Frosty the Snowman" again this year, I"M going to have a meltdown.
I swear, he only got this job because his sister is the manager.
Because he keeps snagging the sweaters.
During our smoke break, he showed me his corn cob pipe.
You'll be shocked by what he has in mind.
Watch out! You don't wanna know what he smokes in that corn cob pipe of his.
He wants to put it on layaway.
Snowbody does any work around here.
He's got like a below zero inseam!
Sure he is "jolly and happy" around us, but seems a bit "frosty" with the customers". "I see him strictly as seasonal help.
Believe, the new guy will not last until spring..
They needed an extra body for Christmas, but he don't make it to the Spring Sale.
Why ? No I didn’t read the fine print.
He's trying but he just seems so Frosty
Jack Frost here wants to get a seasonal brassiere. He said he's getting tired of people applying snow breasts to his chest, with no visible means of support.
Any idea why the new hire keeps giving me the cold shoulder?
Snowman groped me!
He looks innocent enough, but I'm about to go to HR to file a harassment complaint.
I agree he’s a pain in the ass, but hiding his wheelchair is SO not funny.
I'll bet that you could melt his heart!
He only comes in once a year to shop but nothing fits him except top hats and scarves.
He says he's looking for something when the weather outside is frightful.
These holiday temps always end up making such a mess.
Sure he sells a lot of sweaters, but why do we always have to clean up after him?
I told him he might lose some weight before the spring
Why is her name August?
Cold hands, but great at oral.
I think he's giving me the cold shoulder.
The new guy had a frosty disposition
I hope his coal eyes melt his brain if he doesn't quit checking out my ass
Whose turn is it to mop up the floor?
The new seasonal help is a little cold and nosy. Don't you think?
I might have nightmares well into my 30's.
Didn't we used to have a corkboard?
I swear these sweaters make you feel colder.
He's looking to preserve his cool personna while cruising in the Bahamas.
He says he's looking for haute couture.
If one more customer insults his scarf, I swear he’s going to have a meltdown.
The new guy can't work that hard without some kind of a meltdown.
What’s with the cold shoulder all of the sudden?
He's hunting for something to keep him frozen.
Mine is in European Philosophy and my MA was in Kierkegaardian Existentialism.
He says he always buys off the rack.
Strictly seasonal, won’t work past spring.
Doesn't want to expose himself anymore.
I have been trying to give him the cold shoulder since we opened.
The snowman's such a suck up
The new store security guy is getting on my nerves.
The new hire is here just for the holiday rush.
Attention shoppers! Better say goodbye, but don’t you cry: You’ll be back again someday.
He’s a good boss, but don’t even think about torching the thermostat.
Do we carry a jacket with water proof lining?
Don't worry about him - he'll be gone by Friday.
A meltdown sale.
I can't stand these seasonal employees.
Oh him? He's the new seasonal help. Not very helpful though. I think his name is Harvey or Matt or something like that.
He wants to know if we anything that's heat resistant.
I really wish he would stay in the Top Hat and Scarf Department, and quit coming down here all the time. Seriously, what does he know about wearing sweaters?
Don’t let the smile fool you. He only comes here to steal scarves.
The gent behind me says it’s frosty cold outside...
Once he gets rolling there's no stoping him.
Y’know...a month ago, I was like, ‘Frosty is so jolly!’ Now suddenly it’s, ‘who’s the creepy guy in the hat?’
I have only a short amount of time to complain about the land-line you've given me.
He keeps asking for extra small for the spring.
I swear if I have to train anymore seasonal help, I'm going to have a meltdown !!
Well, I think he has a frigid attitude.
I think he'd have more choices if he'd lose a few pounds.
He’s the new security guard. Creepy right?
Have you ever been groped by a carrot?
So much for "You won't be seeing me in the spring."
Ugh, do the seasonal hires have to be so cheery?
Did you get the notice? Starting tomorrow we now have to wear scarves and top hats as part of our uniforms.
I bet he doesn't last till June.
Santa is too expensive to hire this year.
I am the one who has to clean up the puddles after the holiday temps leave.
I hate all the temporary workers they hire at this time of year.
I’ll just go get the mop.
I’ve tried warming up to him, but he keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
I cannot believe management accepted his request to turn off the heat as a disability accommodation. And he's just a seasonal employee!
No, I don't know what it says!
A temp. Just for a couple months, then he’ll hurry, hurry on his way.
He’s here for the Spring reductions
So I asked him if he needed some help and he had the nerve to give me a cold shoulder.
Water resistant.
I'm sorry, I never chose that option.
The seamstress is tired of taking his clothes in.
Do they know we are watching them?
It doesn't go with the scarf, but it is insulated.
What divorce papers?
I told you, I attract empaths.
No. You tell him summer cruise wear is not his look.
Yes, I do realize how difficult it is to break my cable contract.
Can't talk now. Barb just gave me my Honey-Do list.
Joe's Butcher Shop? Can you please provide a different method to deliver your invoice?
I think that we might have listened to the Beatles "The White Album" one too many times
He keeps asking if I smell carrots.
What he told me about his need for clothes just makes my heart melt.
How are we supposed to compete with him? He doesn't even take bathroom breaks.
He keeps accusing me of stealing his corncob pipe.
Guaranteed to shrink at the same pace as both Fahrenheit and Celsius.
"Now that's optimism for you".
She seemed mad when I told her she would need to melt away a few pounds to buy from that rack.
Not only does he not sell pants. It's not hearts that he's melting.
Stop being so paranoid! Can't you see that the guy's just temporary??
So annoying he always leaves the merch a bit damp.
Customers can get frosty with the seasonal help.
Enough’s enough! Stop playing around and tell me where you pinned the note.
He wants to look ‘Cool’to his friends.
Temp.
Can't really say I like the president's new immigration policies.
His wife basically has the same body type.
I refuse to lower the temperature in here just to keep the stuff dry.....
Mr. Frosty says he wants something in “slim”. He says he hopes to have inches just melt off of him in the Spring. Yeah, right, thats what we all say!”
That new guy always gives me the cold shoulder.
Yes, it is a little chilly in here, but he likes it that way.
He pulled a real snow job on that last customer.
Is it cold in here?
We could turn up the heat.
No, I think the "Fathers Day" promotions are worse.
Whelp...looks like hell is finally starting to freeze over.
Every year the seasonal help gets increasingly frosty.
I hope the employee discount applies to seasonal workers, by the summer I’ll totally fit into this.
Should we tell him about global warming before or after his credit card clears?
Frosty told me his commissions tripled after he implemented his carrot and stick approach.
He's a great worker but he's so frosty.
Don't you think putting, "Holiday prices that will make you melt!" is a little too harsh?
He won't last long, the thermostat is set at 72.
If you drop one, trust me, just leave it.
To increase store traffic, the boss has hired an expert in cold calling potential customers.
Ignore Mr. Frosty's comments? No way, he's about to be melted.
The new guy won't sell the polyester knits.
He says nothing too tight. What's the weather tomorrow?
He's always so chill until someone turns up the thermostat.
Have you seen what Evelyn is wearing?
He says he's breaking the 'glass ceiling', here in women's wear
Don't look so surprised, Karen. Management said we were taking on a seasonal employee.
These seasonal workers never fit in with us.
I don’t know her exact words but they hurt.
When he returns for our Spring sale, his waist size will be down by at least 8 inches.
These seasonal employees are way too holly and jolly for me.
He keeps trying things on, and then they end up wet.
He started before Halloween this year, and rumor from corporate is that they're thinking of making him full time.
The worst part is—he doesn’t even wear clothes.
These seasonal employees are just too damn cheerful.
Sales have really cooled off since the new guy started.
Holiday temp. The sooner he melts away, the better.
This jerk's getting the entire sale rack wet.
He comes in every day in the winter, looking for clothes with coal buttons.
Why do you always give the cold shoulder to our holiday help?
I give it two weeks and his humor will be dried up.
He arrived late today and was frozen out of the employee discounts
Look, I'm in favor of energy conservation as much as anyone .... but don't you think it's a mite bit cold in here?
Rhinoplasty for Frosty if they expect me to work through Lunch again.
He’s asking for something waterproof .
I should have known better. The new guy IS a cold-hearted drip.
Don’t worry. He won’t be here for long.
Now do you believe in global warming?
I know you think she's cold, but she's really efficient and customers seem to like her.
I'm thinking haberdashery gave him the cold shoulder.
Love how H.R. just ignores his blatant violation of the no-head-cover rule.
It's cold in here and it smells like carrots - how do you stand this work environment?
Can Frosty at least put pants on when he comes in to shop?
“Jolly, happy soul” ? As if!! He gives everyone the cold shoulder.
It's not fair! He always gets the Santa account.
Tomorrow we tell him about the clean-up in isle 9.
It isn't fair to turn down the thermostat for one customer!
Mr. Frosty says, for some people being cold-natured is a survival mechanism.
I told him 48L but he still thinks he can do a 44R.
His attitude is a bit too frosty
The new hire has been pretty cold to me...
We're saving a ton on heat, but foot traffic is way off.
Seasonal help - just when you've trained them, they evaporate.
He’s seasonal help – melts away in time. HR’s new harassment policy; an Easter bunny replaces him in Spring.
He froze me out.
He never warms up to the customers.
He wants to know if we have anything that would make him look thinner.
Maybe if you tell him about the sale on men's pants he'll take the hint.
Oh that just our seasonal hire, Frosty, chillin' and filling...
He gives every customer the cold shoulder.
Only a hat and a scarf? Is he liberal or conservative?
He's going to pass on the sweaters but wondering if we might have some Tank Tops in stock.
The guy they hired last year just wanted me to sit on his lap so I am not going to complain about how flaky the new guy is.
I'm so tired of upper management hiring solely based on a particular melting point.
The slope of his shoulders, skinny arms--I'd guess xs
He said he's hosting a very cool reception and wants something stylish to go with coal but shrink proof.
Big deal!, he's seasonal and only knows scarfs!
I found his manner quite frosty
Jane: You're folding those wrong, Susan. Snowman: Chill, Jane.
Is this legally binding?
Of course I reapect diversity. But this is ridiculous.
Yes, I know it says “Kick Me”but that’s not the problem
Our new manager is just too ..... frosty.
He insists on shopping with me for winter outfits.
He complained I gave him the cold shoulder.
I'm pretty sure if we don't wear pants to work, Gina, we're Matt Lauered.
I don't care how famous the Snowman is, he has no right to ask if my nipples poked out because he was Cold or if because is Hot.
That's right, doctor. I'm petitioning you to do something about this stabbing pain in my back.
His theme this year is urban chic with a bit of cross-dressing.
He's a temp. I don't expect him to last long.
I think he keeps turning the heat down.
I was hired to sell clothes, not mop up puddles every evening.
He's friendly with customers, but I doubt he'll last long here.
He wants to know if we have black leggings in his size.
'He Believes that with Global Warming, a Spring Outfit is Preferred.'
He gave my the cold shoulder last night.
I told you if you kept making faces- it would freeze that way.
Have you tried recommending he take a sauna?
This guy is having a meltdown about the price. Can we give him a discount?
They said it was their last offer.
It's awfully hot in the fitting room. Do you think he'll survive?
The cold shoulder works on some of them.
He’s looking for something seasonal.
The holiday staff is really cold this year.
He said the last word was his wife's.
Ladies will you check if we carrot this in a large?
Oh, so he's the reason why it's been so cold and drafty in here lately.
My boyfriend dresses like a slob, but the snowman has gone GQ.
These seasonal employees come off so cold. They roll right over you to make a sale and then disappear.
He's looking for something to match the color of his nose.
He’s dating Susan in housewares but I’m sure they won’t even make it past February.
Why bother with that one. He won’t be a returning customer.
He told me to just let him look cause he won't be around long.
Brrr. It’s suddenly become very frosty in here.
He says he’s a medium, but I think he’s an extra large.
His customer service is a bit frosty, don't you think?
I thought Weinstein was in Arizona.
He'll need a smaller size. I put him on a diet and the pounds just melted off.
A customer complained that one of us was being frosty
Seasonal, shmeasonal...he still better knock off the shopping and start folding some clothes!
That guy keeps giving me the cold shoulder. I'm ignoring him.
I started him on folding, but it was a complete disaster.
He insists on keeping it cold, and yet he won’t wear pants.
He's looking for something with a little magic to match his hat.
...yeah, he’s looking to cover up...thinks global warming is a hoax...
That frosty smile, that appalling incontinence--thank god he's a temp.
Can you turn up the heat so he can fit into our sizes?
He's impossible to size.
I think he should go back to the accessories department
He says I'm giving him the cold shoulder.
The new worker needs to chill out and follow dress code. So out of season.
Go figure. He says he can only do that one rack.
It's freezing in here, I'm going outside.
He keeps moving all the scarves and hats to "snowmenswear."
Watch this...Hey, chilly, step away from the spring collection.
I’m all for diversity in a workplace, but this is getting silly.
I still say, if Frosty wants to work here through the holidays, he's gotta wear pants.
If the new guy doesn't stop looking at me like that I'm going to make a harassment complaint.
I don't think he will last through the heat of the Christmas rush.
If he tries anything, remember: go for the hat.
They said the new security guard liked it cold. But I'm freezing.
I know I've said this before, but something just seems off with the new guy from corporate.
He says he wants to the five-pocket boot cut.
As soon as business heats up he will be gone!
They say reliable seasonal help is just a fairy tale.
I prefer his icy stare to the last guy undressing me with his eyes.
He objects to Santa Claus being called old hat.
Do we have a size that can accommodate his melting.
They're getting desperate for seasonal help.
These seasonal workers really give me the chills!
Just ignore him he won't be along soon.
For the new guy, he certainly gives his fellow associates the cold shoulder.
I think he should be in outerwear.
Don’t look! Boss likes dumb employees, let’s pretend not knowing.
he only catches up with the winter fashions.
And the kids all say he can laugh and display just the same as you and me.
The guy behind us thinks his nasally rendition of 'Frosty' will get our attention.
'If we have a meltdown, I'm not cleaning it up!'
I asked the new guy if he wanted to go out after work, but he gave me the cold shoulder.
I don't care if he is a jolly-golly boss; he keeps dripping water on the floor and the merchandise. I wish he would thumpey-thump out of here and we can turn the heat back on.
This is really taking heat conservation to an extreme
Every year, he comes later in the season to shop.
And still, they talk about global warming
No, honest, I haven't seen it yet.
I know what you mean. I’m getting over a suffocating relationship myself.
Here is my caption: "This cartoon would be really funny if I could see it. " But one again, you show only a little box with a question mark in it. I've used 3 browsers - nothing. You gotta do better.
He's just a seasonal employee. I wouldn't get too attached.
By spring you’ll agree, Frosty’ s a drip.
He’s done wonders for our scarf and top hat business, but leaves the floors a mess.
The missus wears the pants in the relationship.
I don't think it's fair that he gets to wear that hat.
I'm just saying the customers don't seem as warm as they used to be.
The tips are for Santa, but we keep them.
He wants to know if it comes in Gortex.
Ew. Does melting on someone count as abuse?
Unless I help him now, he's going to melt.
That creepy new Christmas employee has nothing "down below."
He's a helpful associate, but I wish we didn't have to keep it so freezing cold in here.
I don't mind the groping, I just wish he wouldn't use his nose.
He’s a real cool customer.
something traditional please , my husband is not as cool as he looks
No, I did not wet my pants; when I was on break I accidently sat in Frosty's chair! - Just let me carry this shirt, ok?
Well, that "warm heart" thing is a total myth.
I hope that White snow-boy hurries up and buys.
Do you think he is serious, or just melting?
I get that he's a good employee but I can't stand keeping it this cold in here.
The new guy is pretty chill, but I don't think he'll be here much longer.
I just know he was the Santa last year who insisted that I sit on his lap.
Well, I wouldn't call him undocumented
The new guy seems cool, don't you think?
My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place. The thing is, after a while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know what I mean.
Excuse me, where could I find a really cold jacket?
Ugh, he always wants to put Christmas sweaters on display.
Now we're all out of the Frosty the Snowman costumes, but are there any for Pocahontas in stock?
In my opinion, these new seasonal employees that management is hiring are just unreal!
Tell him that we no longer sell pieces of coal.
“He says he was here last year, and wants to know if he can exchange it”.
What did you expect? 'tis the season.
He says it's not cold in here - ugh.
He promised he'd be gone by Spring
He's a temp for the Season .
Don't worry, he'll melt into them.
Yeah, one look at him and I put #ME TOO on speed dial.
Doesn't he know this is a fire sale?
I think they're taking seasonal security a little too far.
The message was pointed.
Ignore him. In an hour he'll be a puddle, a carrot and two lumps of coal.
He’s dripping into a size 42
He says there's no chance in hell that we carry his size.
I know we need the holiday help but I simply cannot work with him. He's frigid, odd, and the cashmere is drenched!
I told you not to put a silk hat on the decorations.
Dont' worry, she is a seasonal temp.
With a bottom like that he should definitely untuck it.
Forever 21 brings them in, but the air-conditioning eventually drives them away.
Every time I try to warm up to him, he shrinks away.
Look, there's another one...I really hate saying it but they are just always stealing things off the racks. And of course, I do not want to be accused of snowfiling.
He wore only a hat and scarf when they hired him, why are they bothering to fire him now?
And that thing in his ear, it's a corn cob pipe.
Frosty prefers something physique-flattering, but cool -- very, very cool.
Don't think he's just temporary holiday help? Turn the heat up.
He says he needs a sweater if he,s to stay outside
He agreed to take my Thursday shift if I convinced you to turn down the heat.
I know he's excited about working in Fashion, but he seems to leave a puddle wherever he goes.
“Well, would you look at what the snow brought in”....wonder why whitey is all smiles”!?
Would you consider getting a cold shoulder to be harassment?
Seasonals melted away early this year!
He says he's looking for a snowsuit.
Be careful with the new guy. He’s showing off his nose to everyone.
Some customers really frost me.
These sale prices are too low.
I'd go with two sizes smaller ya know, with global warming and all that.
On line shopping is causing our customers to melt away!
Did you see how sloppy his folds are? Seasonal workers never do anything right.
I know, but he says he has had some sort of treatment so he won't melt.
These would be perfect for a ski trip, but he hasn't got any legs.
Nope. That new guy wouldn't listen. Just another not-so-jolly male ego, if you ask me. And a bit frosty, to boot.
He is clueless about summer fashions
Do you have anything in different colors?
The new store detective's not fooling anyone.
He has no interest in our hottest styles.
All these years, I just thought that was Sally’s bad taste. Go figure!
Seasonal help! All that thumpity thump thump doesn't impress me.
I've been giving him the cold shoulder, but it's not working.
He's a great seasonal employee. Just melts your heart that we lose him in the spring! He's a great seasonal employee. Just melts your heart when we lose him in the spring.
How the snowman got his clothes.
That creep is exposing his nose.
I just don't get why we need an outsider to bring in winter's hottest trends.
He always complains that his pants don't fit.
Do you think our new boss is cold?
Jack’s fashion sense is so last century. Luckily he’s only a seasonal employee
Black or White Friday, he says, is just a matter of personal choice.
He started off as a seasonal but was promoted to buyer.
And I still think that wearing white after Labor Day is not acceptable.
Check for missing buttons.
Isn't it early to be putting out the winter line?
Don't you hate seasonal hires? Never here for the returns.
Get him out of here quickly! His size keeps changing the longer he is here!
Ralph wears that every holiday season. He's flaky.
Asked me to go to the dressing room with him to hold his carrot. I should kick him in the balls!
I told him the clothes were too small, but he says he plans to lose weight this Spring.
'Don't you cry, I'll be back again someday?' These seasonal employees have some nerve.
Seasonal help just stops showing up in the spring.
Wish we could shrink-to-fit and wear anything!
``But who would want to hide the socks?"
Careful what you say. He gives reports to Santa.
If Frosty asks for one more break, I'm going to scream.
Do you think if I took a little bite of his nose it would be considered inappropriate behavior?
ARE YOU SURE THE CLOTHING FACTORY SENT HIM OVER??
... but give him a question about summer wear and he just melts.
His sales are OK, but he would do much better in winter wear.
Oh lordy, what was personnel thinking when they hired him to help during the holiday rush. He'll never make it through the end of the day.
Every time I walk up to that guy he breaks into a cold sweat.
I hear he’s on a final written for melting in the stockroom.
You know that's how we started.
The new hire has been acting icey towards me...
You’re telling me there’s an extra charge for breakfast too?
He's a very temporary worker.
And then he said, "Have you ever been snowed?"
Don't mention global warming!
Do you hear a thumpity thump thump?
Look, I just don't want to be the one who tells him when the store discontinues top hats.
Sweaters! Sweaters! Sweaters! You’d think Frosty the Snowman shopped here!
He's a bit wet around the ears, but should work out fine.
He wants to know if we have any coats with three buttons made out of coal and he says he's in a hurry.
Turn up the heat! This guy is a temp.
Let's turn down the heat, or he's going to have another meltdown.
Our system was down on cyber Monday. At least there is something left to buy.
Do you believe this new hire? Roaming around here like he's defrostable
I tried to steer him toward the husky size but he insists his winter weight will be gone by spring.
These seasonal workers just melt under pressure.
Third snowdad bod of the day. He's on his own.
He said he was looking for a snow(mobile) suit!
Just ignore him and be careful not to step in the puddle when he disappears.
This new guy is a real stuck up, he keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
Black Friday isn't a valid excuse for sales anymore.
I think it’s time to tell HR that Frosty isn’t wearing pants again!
Why did you recruit him? He’s, like, the opposite of clothes!
Seasonal hires are so undependable. This one says he's hitting the bricks if that warm front comes through.
Nothing to fear, he'll melt away in a few minutes.
Better move this merchandise before the tax cut is effective and no one will be able to afford it.
I just hope he keeps his hands to himself.
Jolly or not, I told Perry that I would melt him if he came out from behind the rack again with no pants on.
Why is he here? We don't sell any winter clothes
He loves the spring collection. Global warming.
I know his type--they use up your time but never come back.
That frosty stare doesn't fool me, inside he's jolly happy to be monitoring our holiday service spirit.
Could you rush the order for a refrigerator note magnet, please?
Wouldn't you know it? He wants a vest that freezes.
I have your children, they're strapped to chairs and c-4 explosive in a basement, and I swear to God, if I turn around and I see a snowman, your kids are gonna die today.
He lives in his own little world
Cryo Tuesday
Oh, him? He’s the owner’s son’s.
He's part of the new diversity program that corporate has implemented.
Not fair! He gets paid to just stand there and look pretty!
The new guy just exposed himself and started furiously rubbing his corncob pipe.
Our design is tops!
It's called availability heuristic or something.
I'll admit he's cute but there's no way he's my boyfriend!
Yes dear, that really was president Trump not playing golf in the golf cart.
Since we're already into the spring line, management decided to replace Joyce with a seasonal employee. He'll be gone by April.
Are you getting a frosty reception?
Is he the reason why it's so cold in here?
And that is why we've had a wage freeze.
The entire park should be a “no-phone” zone.
I get a feeling that Roy Moore was never here.
100 little leaves on the tree, 100 little leaves, if one of the leaves happens to fall, 99 little leaves on the tree... Now, YOU take it from here!!
Limber up; it’s no-shave November!
They'll never put down roots but it's kind of sweet anyway
I love it when the autumn plaids come out, don't you?
According to Ancestry.com DNA, they're my fourth cousins, twice removed.
I don’t think the new guy will make it to Easter.
I asked the seasonal guy his name, and all he said was "Happy Birthday."
He’s just going to get everything wet.
The body shape is odd, but if you warm up to it, it will change
Portrait of an artist as a lazy SOB.
He said his name was Martin Luther.
It shrinks as he melts
"She didn't so much as leave me a parting note".
Say Martin . . . You trying to make a point?
How can I enter the caption contest when the cartoon doesnt display?! ?
Yeah, she put it where I'd see it.
Oh, the soul-sucking mootness of it all. (your cartoon isn't displaying)
Where's the silly drawing, children?
Whaaaaaaaaatttt? (Woulda been funnier with a cartoon.)
Yes officer, and I believe it was written with a poisoned pen.
Drew drew something invisible.
Sorry,, it's your up.
YooHoo! Our leaves are falling!
So you're sure you don't have any corncob pipes?
"At least he's not dancin' around".
He's shopping for a gift for the Snow Queen - essential that he stays on her good side.
All of these seasonal employees are coming in and stealing our jobs.

He has been kicked out of every department store in town for being a drip.
He's looking for something winter weight in an 86-inch waist.
I know you've got my back!
I am finding our new colleague quite frosty and hard to warm up too.
Sorry, didn't get the memo.
Yes, my wife left me a list but I can't seem to locate it. Can you call back?
She won't promote over you. Watch, by the end of the day she'll be a puddle.
I just wonder who's giving him the Blueberry shopping tips.
He's looking at summer shirts.
Seriously? 'Frosted' American?
He wants something form-fitting for the Mrs...
Do you have a really warm sweater for him because he has to stand outdoors day and night

I'm glad transgender temps are only seasonal.
That hat, so last season. Dang Karen that's cold!
He's looking for 100 percent cotton, synthetics make him melt.
He was a jolly happy soul when we hired him, but now he gives everyone the cold shoulder.
That new sales associate -- I predict a meltdown.
He's looking for something to keep heat OUT!
Since when did we start to cater to old, fat, white men?
It’s OK. He’s white.
He comes from the cloud. He is cool, cold and very frosty when it come to price.
No, we couldn't find him a sweater to fit him last year either...
I forgot my yamakah and talis
It's been freezing in here since the new guy arrived.
Is the new guy staring at me? He’s been giving me the cold shoulder ever since I told him he couldn’t smoke that corn cob pipe. Freak!
He's only temping until Spring.
No use trying to give this guy the cold shoulder.
I think he needs the balloon underwear department!
Gloria, if he's going to a farm-to-table dinner, he can offer his nose as part of the crudité.
Uh oh! Frosty is shoplifting again.
Don't look now, but there's a guy in the aisle behind you shopping on a rack for the wrong sex, wrong size and wrong species.
I think he'd look 'hot' in this red turtleneck.
I've heard they have even worse costumes for us.
His sales are just one big snow-job.
We need to discuss our large employee turnover.
He’s a one rack sales person
He wants something in a men' s wear that goes with white and a top hat. I told him a tuxedo would make look like a penguin. He got all frosty with me.
He's a temporary employee.
But how come the snowman doesn't have to fold?
I could have had that job, but HR says, “You can’t pull off the top hat look, Jackie.”
If my hot flash melts Frosty, please notify his next of kin.
Who knew that Frosty got into the shmata business?
He claims he's officially on the endangered Winter Wonderland List and is trying to keep busy to avoid depression.
He works hard, but only under the Holidays
Sure he got promoted quickly, but I still give him two weeks, tops.
He is our steadiest customer because his weight always changes.
The way he dresses creeps me out. It's like working with Charlie Rose.
Don't underestimate him-he's for real. He's singing "Pra Da La La La , La La La La".
We don't even carry men's wear.
This guy isn't going to buy anything. Let's turn up the heat.
I swear, if he tells one more customer how 'alive he feels'..."
You're wasting your breath trying to get Frosty to push the cashmere. He's decided after 67 years that wool is warmer.
'It's Snow laughing matter. It's diversity gone wild."
"Do we have any sweatshirts that say Frosty?
He's good at selling seasonal clothing, but not much else.
He wants to know if we have any winter jackets without the thermal insulation.
Jolly, happy soul outerwear? I'll check the freezer.
He’s selling like hot cakes in children’s clothing
You think the air conditioner is set too low?
Let's just think warm, and I'll check in the back for more scarfs.
I’m freezing—did you turn down the thermostat?
He's a friend of the fat guy in the red suit who came in yesterday, the one who ho, ho, hoed all over everything.
Can you please get Mangenius to stop pushing the old silk hats?
He wants a double discount for our 'Snowman Sunday'."
You better help him,he says he wants something to go with the scarf and nose!
I’m getting a chilly vibe from that seasonal temp.
We will never find slacks to fit him.
That's all he said,"South for the winter...." He's cold AND cryptic
He says as soon as he tries on pants he could feel it all melting down.
It's just DA Moore again.
Hey, I think that's Pinocchio just trying to snow job us.
You ever been told not to wear a middriff by a snow drift?
Sales Champ and only wears a scarf!
I heard she was melting all over the size sixes!
he has been in before but he never buys anything
I'm being as friendly as I can with the new guy, but he keeps giving me the cold shoulder.
Somehow he gets to a size 0 every spring.
luckily this pop-up shop closes in December
I can see why they sent him up from "Shoes", but don't they understand we're already stocking the Spring collection??
He is good seasonal help but, he always gets off for the summer.
I'm not one to body-shame, but how can he sell the clothes if he literally can't even fit into them.
Just remove his earbud. I'm not used to telecommunicating with a snowman.
I was frozen out in my last job, too.
My suggestion "elastic waist bands"
We've seen a few over the years, all from vintage hats.
He said he’s a ‘snow person,’ and threatened to go to HR.”
I am glad we hired him-everyone wants to buy winter clothes that a snowman approves of!
Since when did mannequins become supervisors?
OK, OK. His choice for the display was chosen. I just wish he'd get that snow-eating grin off his face.
Please tell Mr. Mueller that I have received his subpoena.
Great manuscript, however, I don't like the ending.
The special feature is that it keeps the original temperature of the wearer. Not up, not down!
He says he's looking for nothing that is there and, like, the nothing that is.
He only wears prêt-à-fondre.
It's not the cold start so much as that carrot that makes me uneasy.
He's the new temp.
He wants clothes that will still fit him as he grows smaller
Everything in the store will be half off tomorrow.
Yeah, he just came over from accessories. He'll never be able to stand the heat of this department.
Now he tells me, pants are optional for him this time of the year.
I don't want to sound all "bah humbug" but the new Temp gives me the creeps.
I think I need to come back in the spring when I’ll get more in shape.
Birth is in talks for a comedy
But it’s the only thing that fits him.
No, we're all out of size sub-zero.
It's not like I'm being cold
Do you really think the men got the message when they were given these new uniforms?
Ignore him. He always melts before he pays.
Thanks, I’d like the yogurt parfait and today’s newspaper please.
Mr. Frosty's been acting really cold towards me lately. Maybe it's the change of season.
She's the reason we can't have hot deals.
We don't even sell that old silk hat.
He’s a cold call salles person!
I'm pretty sure it's a silk knock-off.
I don't care if he's just a seasonal employee. He's awful.
That was so nice of you to give Jack this job, but is this the right position for someone with such a short lifespan?
Might want to increase our winter stock.
He's thinks the gaudy hat and scarf would distract from the fact that he's naked
He introduced himself and said he likes "warm hugs." I said, "Haven't you been watching the news lately?"
He said white makes him look fat.
He is asking about the summer close out sale
I have a funny feeling my wife wants a divorce.
He's just like all the seasonal hires who think they can get away with offering to 'have some fun' before they melt away.
Same problem again this year....where to put him.
I thought he was going to melt off a few pounds by this year's performance.
Don't take it personally. Last winter too, he was always exposing himself.
Do you ever wonder if that carrot is genetically modified?
In a few hours from now he’s being transferred to Junior sizes.
I don't know about you, but that "Snowman" is creeping me out."
I wish he'd thumpity-thump-thump over to housewares...he's giving me a chill...
The temp better not get used to this
He's looking foe snowpants.
Yeah, the new guy gave me a frosty look too.
This is a women's shop; snowman should be working here.
Okay, I get that he's head of apparel now but does it really have to be 25 degrees in here?
Want to report a coworker prank.
Yeah, he's just seasonal help. He'll be gone by Spring.
Our new manager is really cool!
Get me Martin Luther
I don't know why they hired him as just a seasonal worker.
"The new guy was all, 'employee discount, hell, ya,' and I said, "hell, nothing, we're not L.L. Bean.''
Who's the new guy? Says he's never heard of climate change.
I offered to help him find a sweater, but he gave me a cold shoulder.
Ever since the new sexual harassment policy, we've gotten some strange new hires.....
Sometimes I think workplace accommodations go too far!
Keep an eye on him... He just came out of the ladies room!
Thumpety thump thump, look at the seasonal help go.
He's complaining again about the shortage of winter pants in size W48 L6....
That's a snowy dude behind us looking for Christmas gifts .
He's good at organizing, but he's frigid.
This snowman gig tops it all
'He's a temp. I adjusted the thermostat so he'll be gone by 4:00.
He’ll have a meltdown if we don’t find the right size top.
Cyber Monday’s melting away our customer base
Was it your idea to save a buck on the new winter help?
Mr. McFloaty Pants thinks he needs trousers.
I think we may want to reconsider the marketing campaign for our winter lineup.
He wants to know if we stock insulated waterproof sweaters.
It's hell when he comes here looking to buy a pair of pants
So how come he gets to wear whites?
Is it just me or did he just gave you a really cold look?
He’s looking for cruise wear.
We don't have anything in his size.
You can ignore him. He never buys. He just melts away
Who's the new seasonal?
He won't be so jolly after eight hours without his corncob pipe.
Well it’s indecent. Get some clothes on him.
He refuses to work in the hat department.
Seasonal help that isn't. This one says he'd rather melt than learn the 5-second fold.
He has been standing in the same spot since we opened. He always has the same expression. He'll be gone before springtime. I just don't understand why we need to take on seasonal help.
I guess we'll need to use the term 'Frosted American' from now on.
Gus won't be such a "jolly, happy soul" once he discovers the true meaning of seasonal employment.
It’s a little warm in here — wait on him first.
He has an aversion to blazers.
He never buys.
Don't worry, he's only a seasonal employee. He won't last until spring.
Do you kow how to calculate body shrinkage from melting?
’Believe me. I need a size 32 in the waist.’ he says. And then his nose grows two inches longer.
I've heard it's going to be a harsh winter.
He keeps asking for waterproof plus sizes.
That new guy is really frosty to the customers.
This one's a cool customer.
Where's the clean up on Aisle 9??
He says he's looking for summer wear.
Don't fall for the melting heart line.
Don’t worry, he’s part-time.
Don't you wish he would just keep his carrot to himself?
Mop and bucket.
"is FROSTY going to MELT on our rack?????
This model is snow friendly. Maybe we can get our colleague to start wearing more than just a scarf.
The guy over there has a funny looking nose.
He's a temp. Next warm day, he's outta here!
I know she's an awfully good customer, but everything she tries on but doesn't buy gets returned wet!
He won't make it to February.
Just ignore him, he’ll be a puddle soon.
He won't know the stock. He's just seasonal help.
So, what's your robot avatar?
I hear his wife is a dragon.
He related to Mr. Frosty, the new HR VP!
I can’t possibly be expected to comment on the motive. It’s outside my field of vision.
I know the new manager is cold, but why does he have to keep the thermostat so low?
It could slushy around here if we don’t sign up more customers for the store credit card.
"You have dreamy coal-colored eyes," what kind of pick up line is that?
I hope he knows he will need a smaller size!
He'll be done at 5 --he has to back to his lawn before dark.
I must say, this store is so 2016!
Seasonal sales help is not what it used to be.
He keeps putting his carrot in where it doesn’t belong.
He was more fun when he didn't care about melting away.
I would be ashamed to use my body like that just to make more sales.
Look busy! That's the honcho from men's X-tra Roly and Poly Collection.
That new employee is a little cold!
He asked me out, but I gave him the cold shoulder
‘Apparently the management wasn’t concerned when I told them he was dealing ice’
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found, because he's the only one making sales this season.
‘Tis the season for his jokes about snowballs.
Sure, he's a great worker...but he tends to disappear when there's a hot sale.
Do you think Frosty is cold, or just flirting with us?
I hate holiday hires.
At first, he said he wasn’t looking for just seasonal work.
Chill-wear is really moving this season.
Tell the new guy to try a dandruff shampoo, he's leaving snow flakes all over.
SOME MEN JUST CAUSE ME TO MELT !!
You know how it is with those special snowflakes -- the first warm day and he'll be gone.
I tried to talk to the new guy but he just gave me the cold shoulder.
He just didn't have the same pull as some of the other shirtless store models.
He just told another customer that our wicking line is dangerous.
Working with a jolly happy soul is getting real old.
The New Guy gets all the customers.
The minute he's melted, that hat will be mine.
...and he never goes for coffee.
Don't pay any attention to him. He gets cold feet when it's time to pay.
I just think it's unfair he gets anti-melting breaks and we don't
Can you believe the holiday schedule he’s proposed?
This year's seasonal help is so mainstream.
He's definitely a temp employee.
There are places and times, when you can meet Frosty the Snowman in Florida.
The new guy seems like a jolly, happy soul, but I don't think he'll last long in the job.
Jill, are you the worker that keeps turning the air conditioner down so low?
Ugh, I hope he's not going to try anything on.
Somebody took a wrong turn at Santaville.
HR just hired Parson Brown.
Farmer's Almanac says it's gonna be a cold one this year!
We'll never get the sap off all those clothes.
So, this is are quack news room.
Whenever a customer asks for help he just melts away.
He says he wants something that won't melt away.
Yeah, we dated for a little while, but I found him frosty.
We needed someone to push our shrinkable sweaters.
I have a feeling these deals can't last.
I'll have what he's having.
One more comment from this happy, jolly soul and I’m gonna stick his nose where it doesn’t belong.
I told him that he would melt on the main floor, but he wouldn't listen to me.
Don't look at him, I'm trying to give him the cold shoulder.
I can’t stand him. He’s so nosy.
Apparently he’s great at risqué love!
"Trust me, there's no commission here. These snow people! They browse, they downsize and then they aren't.
Economic stimulus? We can't even find good seasonal help now!
Can you handle him. I'm not feeling too jolly.
What a snow job. They think these sweaters will sell like hotcakes.
" He starts off a bit cold, but after three days he'll warm to us." "He starts off rather cold, but after his meltdown he'll warm to us ".
Well! Frosty he's not. He just groped me. Okay, he just groped me. Not as frosty as he looks.
He just announced a price freeze.
He's made of snow that formed over Canada, but I heard he's got a green card.
I follow him on Tumbr.

He always waits till the last minute to shop!
He says he's looking for one of our disappearing shirts.
I predict the new guy will have a meltdown during the after Christmas sale.
Have you seen my top hat?
He's asking for the summer sale. He says he needs children's sizes, but I'm telling you he's a size 42 if I ever saw one.
If I were him, I would ditch that hat and scarf to stay as cool as possible!!
I'll never warm up to him.
I don’t think we can trust Frosty with our merchandise.
Every holiday season it's the same. They'll hire anyone.
Seasonal employees are the worst.
"It's time for the final bouquet' - 'bouquet final'
We had one drunk kiss and now he wants to Netflix and chill.
Better call maintenance again. Here's the guy who always pees with excitement at our sales.
He's just so cold.
They say it will be a record cold winter
Our customers don't want anything made in Washington.
Frankly, I don't think this concept will hold much water for very long.
He'll have to melt a lot more to fit in these sizes!
Customers today are looking for a more rounded look or fashion.
First snowfall, these will go flying off the rack.
It's hard to get close to the seasonal help.
The snowman's great, but what happened to Christmas?
he's He's looking for a winter coat.
He's only part time. . . until he melts.
Somebody needs to tell him to stop being so frosty to the customers!
It was ice to meet him
Do you have anything in Pantone 159 Orangutan Orange - I'm a hedge-fund manager and need something unembarrassable, more trumpy than frumpy and throw in a kevlar vest too
Do you think this manager will last?
I won't be the one to tell 'Santa' there's nothing here to fit him.
Some of these seasonal workers just do not have the staying power to make it.
that shopper must be a pervert, he asked me if he should wear pants or a skirt with the scarf.
He says his genderlessness *does* allow him access to both dressing rooms.
It's Frosty, looking for something to go with that old top hat he found.
He put his nose down THERE and said "Susan, nobody can NOSE YOU like FROSTY THE GROWMAN"
Yeah, corporate is still downsizing. They got a deal with Frosty; they don't have to pay a salary or heating.
The part-time help never seems to last.
He said his name is Pinocchio, but I don't believe him.
Seasonal sales help from Frozen Assets is not my idea of 'cute!'
He actually told me he is going to lose over 100 lb. this winter without trying! He is looking for something shrink to fit.
These seasonal hires are such drips.
There's nothing frosty about 'em. I had to remove his horseradish!
He claims to be Scottish and cold-heartedly exclaimed :"where are the plaids, lassie?"
He was wondering if we still carry the scarves with the snow balls.
No, it’s not going to be an amicable divorce
They hired him for some seasonal cheer- but don't they realize he's as cold as ice?
Big size Unisex pants ? Are you kidding ?
Cute tops, but have you seen his pants line?
I know it's at my back, that's why I can't read it.
They may help with the shifts, but these seasonal workers make such a mess.
The carrot?

Do you like my scarf?" "Should we get her scarf?" "I know, we should.
I doubt he'll buy anything...he just asked to see our bathing suits.
He's from the North store.
If he asks me one more time if these come in waterproof material, I'll scream.
His smile says "I can laugh and play," but have you tried to chum up with him? I think he's made of snow.
Why do I have to take all the heat off the new guy?
Don't make eye contact, he'll melt in twenty minutes.
He's the only man I know who is always cold no matter what he wears.
His staring at me all day with that perverted smile on his face gives me the creeps.
Sarah. Where did you put my mother's letter?
he said if I don't
It's the same every year. He just melts when he sees our sale prices!
I know we're supposed to be the 'precariat' but this is getting ridiculous.
He's only part time, his last job went south!
He's not the first boss to ask me to 'nibble his carrot'.
i tell you i need more hours and you hire this bitch what the fuck
She thinks she’s so special. Can we turn up the heater?
We've ran out of wet floor signs already.
He's helping with the flash sale.
Our new seasonal colleague is melting already.
:With all this warmth I hope ne has a Merry Xmas."
He’s seasonal help. He only works in the winter.
I think he's giving me the cold shoulder.
These are selling like cold cakes.
Just ignore him, he's looking for summer sale items.
Why should we all have to freeze in here just to accommodate one other employee with a condition?
Doctor, I can't wait until Monday. It's a Three Day Notice.
Should I upsell him on matching socks?
Unless they put the a/c on, he'll never make it to Christmas.
I think he’s a bit ephemeral for even a seasonal job but who listens?
Are they still predicting a white Christmas?
I know it's his custom, so who am I to criticize, but coming to work in just a top hat and scarf is kinda creepy...
No! I don't 'back-stabber' is too harsh of a term, Joyce !
Personally, I think he should look for a kilt.
Do we fire him now? Or should we wait ‘till he melts?
He never makes it through the shift without disappearing.
He's supposed to have a button nose, and he thinks I'm going to give him one, but he's nuts.
"Yes, I'm sure I'd like to cancel my subscription.
He says he always puts on weight in the winter, but it will fit him in the spring.
He says hang em, you say fold enough, I say no man
At least he'll be gone in a few months.
He pushed me against the dressing room wall and said no one would give a shit because he's just folding shirts not Al Franken. And, like, he's right, y'know? If I didn't need the health insurance I'd quit and move back with my parents.
Don't look now, but we got ourselves another flasher in serious need of a tanning bed.
Those seasonal workers are always cold - don’t take it personally.
I heard from Patsy in HR that having him here works wonders for the company's diversity profile.
It will cost a lot in air conditioning
Gross, Matt Lauer Polos
New guy's from our northern supplier.
Should we call Security?
I don't care how popular he is, he's weird!
I'm not a racist, but...
Picture Bill Clinton seated at a writing desk w/pen and paper sending condolences addressed. "Dear Garrison," "Dear Al," "Dear Matt."
Don't worry, those seasonal employees disappear after the holidays.
He's one of the new temporary replacements.
Be forewarned. Afterward, he just melts into thin air.
Don't stair! He is from the new surveillance program for customer experience satisfaction department.
Well the new manager hasn't exactly been frosty towards me.
I warned you not to mike him.
Really? All season and prêt-à-porte? He must have mush for brains.
Someday is today for Mr. Melt-and-not-pay.
I told him we were worried about having a meltdown this season, too.
This is not the kind of fun I had in mind.
These seasonal employees are all so flakey.
He keeps saying ‘press here for free bread’
I know you did it last time, but I'm not cleaning him up.
He's a new employee but I'll bet that he doesn't last very long.
Now, he won't even talk to me. Do you think ' "Now, he won't even talk to me. Do you think 'Frosty' is a racial slur?
The carrot's an issue. Do we have any cardigans?
He's looking for a climatized label.
What did you do with today’s menu?
Where do we keep wetsuits extra large?
He wants to know if it is guaranteed to shrink.
Society's expectation of holiday cheer is getting out of hand.
Before firing me he said I must be frigid. I wouldn't let him grab my boobs in the elevator.
In the spring he turns into a steamer.
I know it's freezing in here. But if we turn up the heat he gets all over the apparel.
Honey? You won't believe it! Trump just named me Chief of Staff!
Those tops will melt the weight off of you!
oh, get the mop, when he tries on something too small he'll leave a couple of quarts on the dressing room floor.
He says we need to order more "shrinkables."
Does it only come in pull-over?
Should I recommend a skirt instead of pants?
Well, with friends like you.....
I suggested wearing a cabbage leaf under his hat.
He’s only available during the holiday shopping season, but he says he’ll be back again next year.
I told him he's out of season but he just won't listen.
We've taken away the stick and put a freeze on the jackets' retail price.
The new boss is so cold! I don't think he'll last long.
Geez..I got machine taking ours but seriously he's in too?
He deserves a cold shoulder.
That old chap, over there, who keeps on jiving to the in-store music, just put his hand on my shoulder and said, "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you might whatcha‘ need!"
He's getting ice cold water on all of our clothes.
. . . and our commissions will be paid in marshmallows this year.
He can't wear warm clothing for long.
He comes in all the time and makes jokes about inseams.
We sold out of Christmas sweaters last week after he posted a selfie.
.....He just flashed me in the dressing room!
I’m fed up with this cold treatment from the shift manager.
The new guy, I'd love to melt that smile off his face.
OK, he's cute, but all he can sell is sweaters
I'm not going to get snowed here. Man!
Never should have made such a big deal about the AC in here.
Is it just me, or does the floor manager seem a bit frosty today? or He's asking if we carry the new Ted Williams line of cryogenic sweaters.
I'm not worried about the Snowman's sweater, it's the unusually warm weather we're having that's more a concern.
Watch yourself, I think he's a 'secret shopper.'
Just because you are born over the holidays doesn't mean you can wear your birthday suit to work everyday
Cold calling has reached a new low!
The temp is a little cold
What does he know about summer clothing?
He never buys trousers
I don't know why, but I keep finding coal and carrots in the clothing.
He keeps turning the heat down.
They turned the thermostat way down so he wouldn't melt...

I'm pretty buzzed.
I am the Zorax, I speak for the bees.
I said "BEHAVE" not "BEHIVE"!
Behave.
We were out of honey.
I want to be your honey.
Bee mine.
Bee Leave
The queen is dead. Long live the queen.
Don't worry -- bee happy!
I've got to bee me.
Hi, honey.
Hi honey, I'm comb.
Don't 'Honey' me!!
Yas Queen!
And stop calling me "Honey."
I love your dress.
I gotta bee me.
It's a long story.
Worst case of hives ever!
I told you not to call me honey.
To be a bee or not be a bee. That is the question.
Let me buzz you in.
None of your beeswax.
I wanted to see what the buzz was all about.
Well, my mother said I was I keeper.
What's the Buzzword?
I have a bad case of hives!
Meow.
Just beecause.
Every year it's harder and harder to be a WASP.
The dog house was full.
Who's the queen bee now?
"Not to bee", that's the answer!
I'm busy.
I'm King Bee!
Honey, comb your hair.
Just bee yourself
They've adopted me as their Queen.
It seemed like a good idea at the time ...
buzz, buzz
I wanted to see what all the buzz was about.
Please just let me be.
You said you wanted organic honey.
I may have misrepresented myself on JDate and for this I apologize.
Would you bee mine?
She treats me like a king.
You're still my queen.
I love the buzz!
What? You knew I was a W.A.S.P. when you married me.
I'm part of a sting operation.
No, you beehave.
Are you a WASP?
It's not what it looks like, honey
I am minding my own beeswax
Is your mother gone yet?
Just let me bee.
I said be-HAVE yourself.
You knew I was a WASP when you married me.
The Queen invited me.
I was told to beehive myself...
It's not easy beeing me!!!
Here's looking at you Kid!
Has your mother left?
Don't you dare call me honey
I have an audience with the Queen
It's QUEEN Larry, now.
Well I'll bee damned!
I thought you said, ‘beehive yourself.’
Are your parents gone yet?
If you can't beat them, join them.
You can call me queen bee.
I've broken out in hive.
Hold on, I'll buzz you up.
Honey, I can explain...
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Buzz
You knew I was a WASP.
I said I'd behave, not beehive
It's not what it looks like.
Wasp's up?
The bee whisperer!
It's none of your beeswax!
I'm a little buzzed
Home Sweet Home.
It's called hive mind.
We need a queen, interested?
No,I am the bee keeper
Hive you heard the buzz?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Frankly, it's none of your beeswax.
I've decided to bee.
You told me to mind my own beeswax.
I prefer the dog house.
Hang on, I'll buzz you in.
Its really none of your beeswax.
You said buzz off!
Did you bring my epi-pen?
Let's bee together.
I've found a new queen.
A bee, or not a bee, that is the question.
Oh, you said beHAVE
Have you seen my keys?
Bee yourself!
I told you to mind your own beeswax....
Yes, Honey?
Give me a buzz sometime
honey,"Honey will cost you a lot"
Honey, what are you doing in there?
You buzzed?
To bee, or not to bee.
Honey?
I'm queen for a day.
Hi honey, I am home.
I'm not your honey!
Oh! I thought you said beeHIVE yourself.
You thought I meant, 'white Anglo-Saxon protestant?'
It's rent-controlled.
They've finally accepted me as one of their own
And don't call me "Honey".
Please let me bee.
Behave? I thought you said beehive!
That's a bad case of the hives.
Back off, honey!
Pick me!
Just call me 'Honey'
Did you bring the EpiPen?
Hive been expecting you.
I'm embracing my WASP heritage.
You told me to buzz off.
Honey, done!
I wish you would stop calling me honey.
I've got hives.
Bee my honey

I booked it on AirBeeNBee.
I'm part of an undercover sting operation.
I'm playing hide 'n seek.
Will you be my honey?
Beeauty is in the eye of the beeholder.
You'll always be my queen.
Can you just let me bee?
I SAID...It's NONE of your Beeswax!
You called me Honey one too many times....
The doctor said it was hives.
It's my man hive.
Have the Willmeirs left?
Is that you honey?
Mom always said I was a WASP.
Hello, Honey.
Commitment gives me hives.
Bee mine, Honey?
I've been busy.
Looks like that doobee got you buzzed
Has your mother left yet?
Would it surprise you if I said I'm actually Jewish?
I don't like it when you call me "Honey".
I had to see what the buzz was all about.

It's an air bee and bee
I read about it on Goop.
Did your mother leave yet?

Hi honey, what's the buzz?
This is none of your beeswax.

Bee hive, bee hive on the tree whose the fairest of them all.
Get over it, David. Your Jewish. Stop trying to convert!
Want to hear the latest buzz?
Love hurts.
Honey, is that you?
Don't you 'honey' me!
They've accepted me as one of their own.
Call me "Honey".
The doctor says I have hives.
I'll buzz you in.
You look just like your profile picture.
I'll give you a buzz.
I think I misunderstood what a Bumble date was.
Whatever you do, please don't call me honey!
Be all you can be
No girls allowed.
Mind your own bees-nest.
You told me to ask the hive mind.
Your still my queen, honest.
The doghouse was occupied.
Did you bring the birds?
I said behave yourself, not bee hive yourself.
I think we should start seeing other people.
It gives me a buzz. Me

I love you.
Be my queen.
No, actually I'm Jewish.

I was bee-headed!

Bee's knees.
Does this make me look fat?
I have hives.
Honey, there's something hive been meaning to tell you

To bee or not to bee, that is the question.
I want to be alone.

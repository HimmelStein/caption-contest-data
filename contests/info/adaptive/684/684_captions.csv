Stay calm. I think it just wants to be squeezed.
Honey, behind you.
The waffle shirts were a bad idea.
My survival instinct is telling me to play dead, but my OCD says wipe the spout.
Now do you believe me about the chocolate moose?
Anyone find a little yellow cap?
Forget what they said. Run! He's slower than molasses.
Don’t worry. Honey doesn’t go bad.
There must be a Costco nearby.
Careful, these guys can be viscous.
Uh-oh, Drizzly Bear.
I think the situation is about to get sticky.
Now I know we ate the wrong mushrooms.
Oh no. I have it’s little one in my back pack.
Oh no, we're toast!
Sure, he LOOKS sweet...
They told me high fructose corn syrup was the real killer.
Which one of you keeps calling my name?"
Shhhh, we’ll be ok, I don’t see any smaller bottles with her.
Endangered AND made of plastic - I don't know how to process this.
Well, this is a sticky situation.
Just give me your biscuits and no one gets hurt.
Sorry, not you -- I was talking to my husband.
What do you think, use the bear spray or get the biscuits?
The privatization of national parks is even creepier than I thought it could be.
It's Smokey's brother Sticky.
DON’T ...MOVE-—it’s a drizzly.
I don’t think it wants to hurt us... it just wants a squeeze.
You think I’m scary? Wait until you see Mrs. Butterworth!
They’re so cute when you bring them home. You never think about what they’ll be like fully grown.
Don't make any  sudden moves, and eventually he'll crystallize.
Don't run.  Just drop and play bread.
He seems friendly, even sweet.
Don’t worry. It runs, but very slowly.
Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Diabetes.
Can you guys get me out of here? Those Charmin bears are creeping the %#@# out of me.
Does a bear drip in the woods?
He's probably just looking for his cap.
Does a honey bear squirt in the woods?
Quick! Lie down and play bread!
I used to prevent forest fires before I went into advertising.
It’s over, honey. Can’t you see I’m with Stevia now?
Um... honey? Just how much did you put in that brownie?
Not to worry - they don’t move all that fast when it’s cold out.
Keep calm Stan, they only attack when they sense your blood sugar is low
Just tell him he is sweet, and walk away slowly.
And you'd said natural sweeteners couldn't hurt us.
The good news is he doesn't have a mouth.
Honey, bear!
The bad news is you ate the wrong mushrooms. The good news is I’m a squirrel.
Whatever you do don’t waffle.
Very slowly hand me the french toast.
I'm scared and inexplicably reassured at the same time.
I don't know which scares me the most--
the single use plastic or the high glycemic carbs.
Let’s not panic. He looks kind of sweet.
Just hand over the herbal tea and nobody gets hurt.
Is this the kind where we fight, play dead, or turn it upside-down?
I told you an apiary near a nuclear power plant was asking for trouble.
I thought that size was only found at Costco.
Bear hug Mama and Papa for mustard and ketchup ??
If it's brown, lie down. If it's black, fight back. What do we do if it's Grade A clover?
Where did you think those cute little bottles in the supermarket came from?
It's climate change. They're supposed to be crystallized this time of  year.
Don't be fooled -- it's a honey trap.
Stay calm. He's just looking for pancakes.
Go ahead, tweet about me. Who's going to believe you?
No, we haven't  seen the little cap that goes on top.
Must be a Drizzly.
He's harmless -- it's the bees you have to watch out for!
Christopher ?? That you ??  Winnie ?? You've grown up.
I'm just getting some extra part time work for the holidays.   Remember,  only you can prevent forest fires.
Honey, have you ever felt like you were in a New Yorker cartoon?
Excuse me. Have you seen a little yellow cap on your hike?
Walk away. He's slow as molasses.
Can you tell me the way to Aunt Jemima's house?
If we stand still long enough it will crystallize.
It’s part of Trump’s policy plan to privatize the National Parks and replace wildlife with product placements.
Don't be scared - he looks kind of sweet.
Darling, I think you should stop calling me Honey.
I may have put one of her cubs in your backpack
“We’ll have no more problem sticking together.”
Should we run or make tea?
Sorry to scare you guys but can you tell me how to get back to Trader Joe's?
I told you plastics would kill us!
No, YOU give him a squeeze.
The moment internationally renowned father-daughter naturalists Pam and Alex Crimshaw, came upon the first incidence of ursine cultural appropriation in the wild.
All I did was look up honey on Amazon before we left the house.
It's a classic honey trap.
He may look mean on the outside, but he's actually really sweet on the inside.
Yeah? Well, I say YOUR hats are stupid!
I did the Smoky gig for a long time, but my agent felt there was more money in honey.
Have you seen the muffin man?
Does a bear squirt in the woods?
I wouldn’t worry too much, I hear they’re slow as molasses.
Don’t worry, he’s way more tasty to us than we are to him.
How did the Ranger say we could tell if it’s product placement or an actual bear again?
Does this mean we're toast?
It's Smoky's wife, Honey
Uh oh, this could get sticky.
Which of you has the sore throat/
I'm starting to think those mushrooms weren't morels.
Is that the new Free Range Honey everyone is talking about?
Things have changed since Smokey took up vaping .
Have you seen three bears carrying a roll of toilet paper?
The trick is to be still and not let him know you have a sore throat.
No sudden movements. I'm retrieving my thermos of Earl Grey from your bag.
Nooooo. Don’t be afraid. I’m a ‘viscous’ animal. Viscous!
They were wrong, honey can go bad.
Don't move, he looks viscous.
Give the little one back!
I don't know.  He seems sweet enough.
Honey?
Well that probably explains the giant bees and the over-sized flowers!
I told you  today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic!
Careful, don't make any sudden pancakes.
Still think refined sugars are more dangerous?
Nancy and Jasper suddenly realized the mushrooms were kicking in.
Hang back a sec - this could get sticky.
I guess you are what you eat.
Back away slowly before things get sticky
No thanks. We like avocado on our toast.
I'd be terrified if we didn't have scones.
We’ll be OK. It can’t run uphill.
I know what it says, but don't be fooled.   It's mostly high-fructose corn syrup.
I think we used one of her cubs at breakfast.
That's Smoky the Bear's main squeeze.
We better get our buns out of here.
It's me Smokey, I've been cross dressing for years and it feels great to finally be out
I warned you not to wear that waffle knit shirt.
Well, wouldn't YOU be upset if someone kept flipping you upside down and smacking your feet?!
Good Lord, it's a drizzly bear!
Must be the day the teddy bears have their picnic.
Well, make up your mind Karen we can't both be your 'Honey Bear'!
If he attacks, I'll hold him upside down and you squeeze!
Uh-oh. Looks like we're toast.
That must be Smokey's big squeeze.
Don’t worry, they’re quite viscous this time of year.”
Remember, only YOU  can prevent Type II diabetes.
Hand over the toast and nobody gets hurt.
Don’t worry, it’s just a drizzly bear.
I think we're safe--he's crystallized.
We must be near a Costco.
Let's not argue, Stan. Give him the Cheerios.
Just play bread and it won't hurt you.
We catch more tourists with honey than with vinegar.
Sweetheart, the gummies are kicking in.
It would be a lot less confusing if you’d just call each other ‘Sweetheart’.”
Oh no, it's a drizzly - don't make any sudden moves or things could get sticky.
I didn't know the saying "you are what you eat" applied to animals too.
Have you seen a waffle run by?
We must be getting close to civilization!
I think we’re toast.
Quick — do we play dead, fight, or prepare tea?
We're okay- He's vegan.
Be careful dear, I don’t think it’s organic.
Stay perfectly still. It will eventually crystallize.
No sudden movements. There's nothing more dangerous than plastic containers and processed sugar.
Organic, local, raw.  Whew, that's a relief
He seems rather sweet.
Just walk away quietly... honey bears have no legs.
Relax -- I think only the high-fructose ones can hurt you.
You guys are looking at me like you're both diabetics.
Forget him; watch out for the bees.
I do believe that’s it’s time to question ourselves about those “wild “ mushrooms we ate earlier.
Uh, honey, I think those mushrooms are kicking in.
Who you callin' Pooh?
I guess that’s not too surprising here in the Kraft-Heinz National Forest.
He must have tailed us from Costco.
Forget it, there's no way I'm putting the top back on again!
I’m afraid we’re toast.
Don't worry, honey never goes bad.
Sorry, when I said "honey, I think we're lost," I was talking to my husband.  But thanks for the offer.
Can I hide out with you guys?  The vegans are after me.
Don't worry.  I think he's sweet.
What now, Stan? Are we supposed to run or squeeze?
We should discreetly tell him that he needs to wipe.
Only you can prevent refined sugars.
I thought we only had to worry about artificial sweeteners.
I'm a bit plugged up; could I trouble you for a gentle hug?
He wants directions to IHOP.
Let's see how you like it when I turn you upside down and squeeze!
Play diabetic.
This could get sticky, fast.
If he gets us in a bear hug, we're stuck.
I thought there was an ordinance  warning bears not to feed humans.
Can you inform Sir David Attenborough I exist?
The poor creature seems to be clogged.
I can’t remember if it’s run, play dead, or whip up a batch of pancakes.
I knew we shouldn't have eaten the whole bag of cannabis gummy bears.
Have you seen my husband Smokey by any chance?
Are you local?
Goldilocks?!!! It's me.
I thought he was cute at first but now he keeps asking me to squeeze him.
5$ for an instagram post, 10$ for a story. Otherwise I eat you.
Be very careful. I’m not sure it’s organic.
Just do as I do....I’ve been in sticky situations like this before....
What do you mean, "Silly Hat"?
Have you two even looked at each other lately?
Roger, let's just hope he's not part of a Costco 3 pack...
Don't worry, it runs slow.
I've seen bigger ones at Costco.
Careful, it looks viscous.
Just play bread
Very slowly hand me the cap.
I don't think those were morels we ate.
Uh oh, I think today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.
Just keep moving. And whatever you do, don’t waffle.
You guys are toast.
I think she saw us squeeze her baby.
It's got to be the mushrooms.
They're viscous, not vicious.
Oh no! That must have been her cub we stole from the cafe!
They always seem sweet at first.
... maintain eye contact, walk slowly, and whatever you do, don't mention collapsing bee populations.
This explains the plastic bear scat all over this trail!
What? You were expecting Pooh?
I have a feeling that things are going to get sticky.
I think we’re okay- he looks sweet-
I think we picked the wrong mushrooms.
Only in America do they reach this size.
I think we should lay down and play bread.
Lick your what!
Pardon me, folks. Could you tell me which way to IHOP?
I am torn between playing dead and making toast with peanut butter.
He’s not going to eat us. He’s too sweet.
I'm looking for a guy named Pooh. He ate my brother.
He looks kind of sweet.
I don't know whether to play dead or make tea.
Nothing to worry about, he seems sweet
Stay calm.  He looks sweet.
Now, the park signs make sense!
“Don’t Squeeze the Bears”
Have no fear. He must be the one Goldilocks said was “just right.”
Whoa. Product placement is getting out of control!
No use trying to run, Bob. I think we're toast.
He wants a squeeze.
I knew it was a bad idea to eat those wild mushrooms.
Think!  What would Goldilocks do?
I'm telling you, back in the day, I was better known than Smokey!
Well, this is a very sticky situation.
He says he works at the pancake house down the road.
Remember that party in the woods after Woodstock? Well, she says you’re the father.
Yeah, they look sweet but they’re still wild animals!
He says we should squeeeze his tummy, but I think we should run
Not you, I was calling for my husband.
Don’t be fooled by his sweet looks. He is a bear after all... Just give him the peanut butter and the bread and slowly walk away.
Still a climate change denier, Allan?
Stay calm; they can sense fear.
Fear, and pancakes.
Don't you just hate how commercial the forests have gotten these days?!
no thank you. we prefer maple syrup.
I'm filling in for Smokey this week.
Don’t worry;  he’ll be moving very slowly in this weather”
Careful, he's unrefined.
We've been in worse jams.
Do you mind wiping my top?
Looks like Smokey's all-in for Halloween.
If you say that this could get sticky, I will slap you, Charlie.
It's okay, I think he's crystallized.
What if he's not as sweet as he looks?
Kyle, I don't think those were Chanterelle mushrooms you foraged.
I forget—do we play dead or make toast?
Slowly remove the toast from your pack and place it on the ground.
You’d catch more millennials with local honey.
Are you sure you picked the right mushrooms?
I've heard of product placement, but this is ridiculous!
Wow! First we find those yummy mushrooms... now this? !
Graham...I think it's kicking in.
Very. Slowly. Hand me. Some toast.
Whatever you do don’t say we’re toast.
He'll never catch us. It's January.
You said you recycled him
I can't remember. Do we play dead, or make lemon tea?
Do we back away slowly?  Play dead?  Just get out some toast?
Don't worry - that's not a grizzly bear, it's a drizzly bear.
So...you see it, too?
She's probably just protecting her pancakes.
Hmmm! This could be a sticky situation!
I don't know...all I said was "honey bear with me while I find the map."
They said honey never went bad
I guess that explains that giant pancake we were wondering about.
Well, we can check this one off the bucket list.
Thought you could ditch me after breakfast, huh?
Gosh, even the wildlife here is commercialized.
It actually looks pretty sweet.
I get the feeling we might be toast...
I thought you said we were in Vermont.
Oh great, there’s going to be ants everywhere.
Did you call me?
This is about to get sticky.
I told you Yosemite is being commodified.
We're going to need a bigger pot of tea
Look, even Pooh sold out.
I didn't see this coming when Trump privatized the National Parks.
Watch out dear. This is a sticky situation.
Everybody wants "local" but no one wants "close"
I thought honey never went bad.
I'm afraid we might have one of her children in the kitchen.
Don't show fear. They smell fear…

and pancakes.
Be careful, he is very viscous.
Just one minute, I have information on the Bidens
Something tells me it’s not organic.
Smokey Bear has the day off so don't start any fires.
Let’s let him hibernate in our pantry.
I’ve gotten out of stickier situations.
‘When asked ,the Cohen’s would refer to this day as the day they packed it in.’’
When you don't put the cap back on, it haunts me all day.
Catching flies. What are you two doing?
Tip me over and pour me out
Tigger and I are playing hide and seek. Please, don't give me away.
I can tell by his lid, he’s domesticated!
Stand still, stay quiet, and don't squeeze him.
I missed you guys at breakfast.
Must be Smokey's honey.
I think it doesn’t know what it should do in the woods.
Quick! The herbal tea!
I won't hurt you, unless you have Type 2 Diabetes.
If you see a woman filled with maple syrup tell her her husband will meet her at the car.
Remember, only you can prevent artificial sweeteners.
Careful, if he attacks it could be a sticky situation.
Ironically, we will be killed by something on the Paleo diet.
Look honey, he's so sweet!
Did the brochure say “vicious” or “viscous”?
I’m guessing it comes from Costco.
Smokey the Bear was privatized. That's Comrade Poohtin.
Remind me to never call you by your pet name in the woods."
Dad, we shouldn't have eaten those mushrooms.
Just don't call him 'Honey Boo-Boo'.
I always wondered why the bottle is not in the shape of a bee.
Whatever you do, don’t act like a pancake.
I can’t remember. Back away slowly, play dead, or break out the biscuits?
Tired of fighting wildfires, Smokey tries a new gig.
Don't worry, I read that if you stay still long enough they crystallize.
Hey, for a hundred bucks and some weed I'll introduce you to Bigfoot.
If he wants to believe he's Winnie the Pooh just humor him.
If Mrs. Butterworth comes by, I was never here.
Maybe we should lay off the wild berries for a while?
I’m afraid. He’s not organic or local.
Only you can prevent toaster fires.
It's okay. The ursus plasticus feeds only on pancakes and waffles.
Oh no! That little one must have been her cub!
Maybe she smells your Earl Grey
Don't trust him.  He's just a Pooh in bear clothing.
The ranger made them seem so much more dangerous.
Yeah, one of you was supposed to wipe off my hat when you were done.
I'm afraid it was her cub we used on our biscuits.
If it's Manuka we can retire..
Do you think I put too much pot in the brownies?
Well next time don't leave a bread crumb trail..
Do you think we should play bread?
Do I run, or do I squeeze it?
Pretend to be insulin resistant.
Told you we shouldn't have eaten those 'schrooms.
Sometimes you follow your dream, sometimes your dream follows you.
In January, you can outrun them.
Careful, it could be a 'cereal' killer!
Relax. He's crystallized.
Just play diabetic.
I'm sure he's very sweet on the inside.
We've got a sticky situation here.
Let’s make a run for it. He slower than molasses.
He must take us for saps.
Looks like Smokey's gone into business.
You’re not fooling anyone - sugar is sugar.
Think she knows we ate her little ones?
Could I borrow a hat? The flies out here are terrible.
Actually, no, I don't sh_t in the woods. And we all don't look alike either.
So THAT explains the gooey rabbit.
Oh no! Now we’re toast.
Your honey or your wife.
I'm as lost as you are.
Quickly and quietly, Dear, get out the English Muffins.
Watch it-he may not be as sweet as he looks.
I think we’ve found ourselves a sticky situation.
I don't know, it just seems like too much of a good thing.
Where did you get your caps?
It's not abominable.  I think it's sweet.
Don’t worry, he’s one of the sweet ones
Do you guys have an extra wet wipe?
Frank, please tell me you remembered to bring the scones.
If you see Smokey, please tell him his Honey is looking for him!
Just lie down and play bread.
We're gonna need a bigger waffle iron....
They say you can't outrun a bear but I think we have a pretty good chance with this one.
Ok,which one of you turned my son upside down at breakfast today?
Back away slowly and hope he does not smell the biscuits
I see them every day on Instagram, but this is my first time seeing an ad in the wild.
Mrs. Butterworth warned us about these woods.
He's not as sweet as he looks.
I think we can outrun him.
“I swear, this is the last time I drop acid while hiking in the woods.”
Don’t let his sweetness fool you
Honey...Did the kids shrink us?
I think he wants us to help him find the cap?
Maybe calling out "Honey" when you got lost wasn't such a good idea.
I hear they’re most dangerous when they’ve lost their cap.
Don't worry. My aggressive tendencies are targeted exclusively at bees.
Fall down and play bread!
This might be sticky.
You don't have to worry about Honey Bears, it's the Honey Badgers that you have to watch out for"
Poor guy must be lost and scared—there’s not a Costco around here for miles.
Don't trust him. He may look sweet, but his sugar content is deadly
Quick! Play bread!
He must sense the pancake mix in your backpack
Excuse me... did you just ask him about the bears and the bees?
I told you to tip at the pancake house!
We'll be safe. They always stick to the ground.
The sign clearly said to not squeeze the bears!
Let's hope we are not his cup of tea.
Very slowly hand me the insulin.
It doesn't run fast, but when it catches you, you're stuck!
Remember, back away slowly and don't call me 'Honey"
Have you seen a pile of pancakes?
Well, exsqueeeze me.
Have you seen Smokey? We have dinner plans.”
Don't be scared! He's just looking for his cap.
What's she going to do, glaze us to death?
So what do you think I do in the woods?
I thought you said it would never go bad.
You better be scared.  I'm made of single use plastic.
Careful.  One wrong move and we’re in a real sticky situation.
Oh no, today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.
She must be Smokey's girlfriend.
Slowly now, Phil, take out the little bottle and put it back in the nest.
I thought honey can't go bad?
As long as we stay out of the sun, we should be able to outrun it. When it's this cold, they really slow down.
How about a squeeze?
Oh no, Henry, I think you have one of her young in your pack
Remember, it’s what’s inside that counts.
Smoky is busy fighting fires in California, so I'm contracting as his replacement in this park.
Excuse me. Can I borrow some toilet paper?
I guess we shouldn't have eaten her cubs.
Suddenly Joe realized Karen was right.  Their guide to edible foraging should not have included wild mushrooms.
I wonder if he's thinking we're not what he expected either?"
Looks like we're toast.
Don't worry. This species has a sweet disposition and is slow as molasses.
That must be the one Mrs. Butterworth told us about.
Chubby lil' fella, wears a red shirt, got a call his 'hunny' pot's empty... sure you haven't seen him?
If you wouldn’t mind giving me a little push? I’m stuck.
Looks like they do more in the woods than we thought.
Is it weird that I kinda want to be mauled?
Look, even the big ones leak!
I wasn’t insulting you. ‘Honey Bear’ is a term of affection for my idiot husband who got us lost.
Can you help me? I’m in a jam.
I'm sorry, we gave all of our change to a bear wearing a forest ranger hat that happened by here five minutes ago.
Run? Play dead? Run? Play De...

This is no time to waffle!!!!
I know they say to keep your distance from the wildlife, but this bear looks so sweet!
Back away slowly, don't run and get the pancakes.
I know I'm not as cute as Winnie the Pooh, but you two aren't exactly straight from the LL Bean catalogue either. _And don't call me 'Honey.'
Wait 'til you see the lions and tigers.
Play dead? I've been playing dead since we got married.
I believe you purchased one of my offspring for $4.99, and I'd like her back please.
He may come at you in a painstakingly slow manner
So I guess everyone likes honey?
Careful, they can smell blood sugar...
I'm hiding from the Pooh bear.
We’d better be careful...I don’t think it’s locally sourced.
Tell him you’re diabetic
Excuse me, do you have any camomile tea?
Oh my... and on the store shelves, they look so cute and friendly...”
I think we stumbled into the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder of honey bees.
And straight ahead you'll find the land of milk.
Don't get between it and the pancakes.
This could become a very sticky situation!
He says only we can prevent dry toast.
We should play bread.
I think we are about to be in a very sticky situation!
Don't poke the bear, honey.
It's not that my husband doesn't like you but he's diabetic.
It must be from Costco.
Aw man. Now the bees are going to find us!
"Lets just stay calm until it runs out of date
Smokey? He died of diabetes.
Honey Bear?  No, I'm the anal lube bear.
Oh great. First the gummy bears, and now the honey bears!
I'm not sure whether to use my bear repellent or my insulin patch.
We’d better run. This could get really sticky really fast!
I’m thinking you were wrong about those mushrooms we found.
Whatever you do, don't lie flat as a pancake!
We could squeeze him to find out for sure.
Brown...get down. Black...fight back.  Honey..be funny. Quick...tell a joke.
I read somewhere that if you play diabetic it'll leave you alone.
I did see one that size once at Cosco.
You say it won’t spoil, but what if it goes bad?
Smokey's cutting back. I'll be  subbing weekends"
Careful. I don't think it's organic.
The brochure said to stay calm and play bread.
Honey, I'm afraid this could be a sticky situation.
Assume the biscuit position.
Ok, avoid eye contact, stand your ground, and don't, Phillip, try to clean his nozzle.
Let's pick up the pace.  We don't want to get stuck to this guy for the rest of the hike.
Looks like we've gotten into a sticky situation.
I would be scared, but he looks so sweet!
Not to worry. I'm only here to service the folks who booked their climb through IHOP.
I think he wants a tissue.
Honey, I think we're toast.
Well, that tells us he does Pooh in the woods.
Psst...over here...you guys looking for some alternative sweetener?
But it was only $10.99 at Costco!"
The trail guide says to lie down and act like toast.
It about to get sticky
Stand perfectly still or we’re toast.
I guess it’s what we get for switching to agave.
I don’t know, he looks sweet to me.
Let's invite him to breakfast.
Must be a COSTCO nearby
I guess you could call this an unbearably sticky situation.
I think we're ok, honey doesn't go bad.
No I'm not going to eat you.  I'm going to turn you upside down and squeeze every last drop out of you.
I know you hate fix-ups, but he might be perfect for Mrs. Butterworth.
Play bread.
I told you not to eat those mushrooms.
Okay, I’ll distract by waving my arms and shouting “HEY!” Then you sneak up from behind and squeeze his bottom.
Relax. All I want is that thermos of tea.
Can you direct me to the nearest IHOP?
Your thinking Smokey, I'm Sweetie the bear.
Bear with me, Honey.
Sweet on me? I think he’s sweet on you.
You didn’t buy those mushrooms at the grocery store, did you?
Mrs. Butterworth is right behind me.
So, which one of you said, "Honey bear with me?"
Honey, take a hike.  Bill's my main squeeze now.
We can't outrun him, but if we both squeeze real hard we can empty him out.
They are also native to aisle 12.
Remember your training: no eye contact and back slowly away – that’s a Drizzly alright!
Very slowly dear, dig out the cornbread
He doesn't look organic.
Luckily, they're slower than molasses.
Why couldn't it have been Mrs. Butterworth?
Stay calm. It's only a threat to infants under twelve months
Hey, it's Smokey the Bear's cousin, Sticky.
The small ones always look so peaceful.
Dammit, someone's been squeezing the wildlife again!
How dangerous could he be -- he looks quite sweet?
Honey bear? That's just the sort of sexist, demeaning, and OH!
Hansel and Gretel's nightmare continued...
It's cold, we can outrun her, she will be slow as molasses.
Uh-oh.  This could be sticky.
Looks like we're in a sticky situation
Don’t panic or we’re toast.
Too bad Agave's all the rage, otherwise a selfie would be in order.
Who do you think Smokey goes home to at night?
It’s no use, dear.  It’s sticking with us.
I heard they’re as slow as molasses.
Whatever happens, we're going to stick together.
I told you to put a lid on it"
Something tells me he’s not as sweet as he looks!
Sure he's terrified. Look how they redesigned ketchup.
Lets just throw down our pancakes and walk away slowly.
Ursus Condimentus.  From the looks of her, she is a 10 on the Butterworth scale and dangerously unpasteurized.
It's okay, it can't hurt us. You just might be sticky for a few days.
They say this is a product of climate change that we could not have predicted.
Uh-oh, we're toast now.
Catch more flies with honey, you said ...
I’m purpose-driven wildlife. I’m refillable, too!”
Honey, we definitely ate the wrong mushrooms back there.
Don't worry, honey - they're viscous not vicious."
i've got a feeling this could get sticky.......
He claims he's the real Winnie the Pooh
My doctor always said sugar would be the death of me.
The Smokey outfit was already taken.
What are we to do with this sticky situation? You told me that honey never goes bad!
Winnie the Pooh has better PR, but I’m a lot sweeter.
For some reason, I don't think he's native to these woods.
Predator? But he looks so sweet.
If we’re gonna keep camping we need to come up with some new pet names, Dear.
I hope it's Winnie, 'cause I just poohed.
This might be just the opportunity to try out our cinnamon bagel bear pepper spray.
Howard, how old WAS that ‘funny little cigarette’ you found in the jar?
He’s clearly local, but do you think he’s organic?
OK.  I'll turn him over and you smack his bottom.
You run for help. I’ll distract him with a cup of chamomile tea.
Per ounce that container is the lowest cost option, but how do we get it home?
That's weird--the ranger said there were no product placements in these woods.
I told you Disney can’t do an authentic backpacking experience.
Don't call it quid pro quo but if you've got the bread, I've got the honey.
Well, you said you wanted to see your sweet honey bare!
You are what you eat.
I said, "Look, honey - it's a bear!" Not, "Look, it's a honey bear!
Did you bring the peanut butter?
That's it, no more picking our own shrooms!
Ah, look honey..
He can smell your diabetes.
These targeted promotions are getting harder to avoid!
SURPRISE !  If you guys could pick up a Challah on your way back, I make a French Toast to die for.
We'd better be careful, a sweet look can be deceiving.
Did he just call us 'crackers'?
Sugar really is hidden everywhere these days.
He knows his children are stashed in our cupboard!
I'm here to bring you to your airbeenbee.
I just need your waffles, and I’ll be on my way.
I swear, I had no idea they were recyclable!
I know I should be frightened but all I can think about is peanut butter.
I had a dream just like this on keto.
Only you can prevent colony collapse disorder.
I'm not sure whether we should run or take out our spoons.
How sure are you about the mushrooms earlier?
They said not to feed the bears but nothing about the bears feeding us.
Smokey is on vacation and I'm the only one the park rangers could find on such short notice..
Only you can prevent a bland cup of tea
Don't panic, we'll be fine if we just stick together.
I don't like the way he's looking at you, honey.
Could be a targeted ad...
You turned my father into a bong. Prepare to die.
But on the inside, I feel like Mrs. Butterworth"
You remember when I told you your sweet tooth would catch up with you?
If it charges, play bread!
This is a sticky situation.
I think you are supposed to make yourself look big, and not mention maple syrup.
So sad. Looks like Smoky the Bear is suffering from early stage dementia.
Yikes! This must be about the whole bee thing!
I told you we shouldn't eat that magic mushroom....
Just call me Honey Boo Boo!
Hand over the artisanal Greek yogurt and nobody gets hurt.
Did Ranger Jan say anything at all about product placement?
Maybe we shouldn't have made a bong out of the little one.
Funny, he doesn't look that angry in the grocery store.
I forget – do we make load noises or a pot of herbal throat tea?
We don't have any toilet paper. Why do you ask?
I don't know if we should run or make tea.
Are you sure those were just your garden variety mushrooms?
This could be a sticky situation
I can't believe you managed to get us into ANOTHER sicky situation!
Scared? No. It makes me hungry for pancakes.
He looks sweet, but so did the Honey Badger.
Where was he at breakfast?
I’d heard the park service was rebranding.
Well, at least it will be a sweet way to go
I think we're supposed to lay down and play toast.
Uh-oh, this could be a sticky situation.
And you call ME overbearing?
I think he wants a selfie.
Can you get me a hot washcloth?
What did you do with Smokey?
Pretend we're beekeepers
That bear just tried to whisper sweet-nothings in my ear!
What was in that trail mix?
We could squeeze him, but I don't think he'll run.
Whoooooaaaah. Dude! The weed is way stronger than it was back in The Day.
Throw him the granola and run!
It's O.K.--he looks sweet.
Don't worry; if he's over half-full, we can still outrun him.
Trick or treat!
Stop arguing and give her your cap.
She's harmless. Honey never goes bad.
Bigfoot. Who knew?!
Don’t worry, they never go bad.
DO you see him too, or is it my CBD?
Is this the trail to the tea party?
So that's where they got the idea
Relax - he's gluten free.
What’s in a bear?  That which we call honey by any other name would taste as sweet.
The guidebook said to stand our ground and show a biscuit.
Quick, the chamomile!
Careful.This may be a honey trap.
So I guess this is the drizzly bear they'd warned us about?
I think "How Sweet It Is to Be Loved by You"  was a poor choice for a trail song.
I thought they said honey never goes bad.
Oh no! A honey bear!
I don't think that bear hug will be as sweet as it looks.
Are you seeing this too or is it the psilocybin?
Okay quickly now... Stop, drop, and get the rolls
Don't worry, it's just a stereotype. I'm probably more scared of you eating me
Careful, he's still bitter over losing the forest fire gig.
Didn't realize there was a Cosco nearby!
None of your beeswax
Forget everything I said about gun control.
Honey, I think the kids shrunk us.
One false move and we’re toast.
ANYTHING TASTES BETTER WITH HONEY
If he's got that much honey, shouldn't we 
be concerned about the bees?
Give her your cap.  You can order a new one from that ad in The New Yorker.
Ignore him. It's a scam. Last week he was pushing porridge.
Let's get out of here. We don't need a repeat of what happened with Mrs. Butterworth last year.
Only you can prevent Bee Extinction"
Got a spoon?
I'm just gonna say it. This is a sticky situation.
Quick! Play dead or we're toast!
Pull the cub out of my pack.   Show her it’s a different brand!
Leave him.  I can be your sugar daddy
We should have listened to Mrs. Butterworth when she told us to turn around.
Ditch the pancake mix and run!
I can't remember if we're supposed to run away or pretend to be a large, menacing teapot.
With his perfect disguise, the bear lured yet another two hikers into his hideous trap.
I didn't know bears dressed up for Halloween!
It's hunting season, so yeah I'm a honey dispenser.
Quite the sticky situation we're in.
Quick! Suck in your muffin top!
Careful -- This might get sticky.
Now don’t panic!  He’s huge, but he does look rather sweet!
Which one of us do you think he's sweet on?
Pardon me folks, I'm in search of a friend.
Have you passed by a...Mrs. Butterworth's?
You never wondered where all those cute honey bears came from?
Well, that's one way to attract a mate.
Hi, welcome to my woods. And do you have any pancake mix?
I’m Home!
I just escaped from Costco.
Do you think it’s organic?
Sorry, we're keto."
Just interested in your buns!
I never thought he was real.
Get the cinnamon sugar spray.
This proves it.....you ARE what you EAT!
For this kind we're supposed to lay down and play bread.
How did you know my name?
Looks like we’ve gotten ourselves into a sticky situation.
Yes, of course I do.  I mean, the Pope is Catholic, right?
Excuse me......but have any of you seen my lid?
Genetic engineering has gone too far.
Don't worry, he tastes better than we do.
Graham, you’d better run.
I think this low-carb diet is starting to affect me.
Smarter than the average bear? Or just sweeter?
It was at this moment that they realized that they probably shouldn’t have eaten those wild mushrooms
It's Honey Bear, not Honey THE Bear
It's a honey trap!
Excuse me, have you seen my Aunt Jemima?
I think its kind of sweet the way he keeps sticking around.
Yeah, I think we're toast. But does HE?
If we can't outrun him, we're toast.
Whose woods are these I think I know/
He takes his tea unsweetened though.
At least it's not Tony the Tiger.
Are you folks here for the Teddy Bears' Picnic?
You can't have your honey and eat mine too!
That's one scary piece of single-use plastic
OK think, what would Mrs. Butterworth do?
I told you we shouldn’t have eaten those mushrooms.
I told you I wasn't farting.
Uh, might be wrong, but I don't think that's indigenous.
Are the biscuits in my pack or yours?
I don’t think the pepper spray is going to work,
I hear they can't run very fast in the cold.
Honey, bear with me.
Wait...what do you mean you’re not local?
Quick: throw the waffles and run!
Ew. Someone forgot to clean off the cap!
This is sure going to create a whole lot of buzz.
Have you seen my husband? He looks like a ketchup bottle.
I thought we left it at Costco!
How about we see if YOU soften up in the microwave?
Only you can stop colony collapse
Have either of you seen the Pillsbury Doughboy run by?
Don't worry Phil, it's the only natural substance that never turns bad.
I have not seen anything like that since we were at Costco.
I heard that Smokey was making a midlife career change but I didn't believe it.
Stay calm, this could be a sticky situation.
I’ve got bad news for you guys, and I ain’t gonna sugarcoat it...
It's the waffle plaid, it attracts drizzly bears...
Honey, did you forget to replace the cap again?
Ugh, it’s pasteurized.
Did you see a scone go by?
It might just want a friendly squeeze.
I’m looking for Mrs. Butterworth.
Can you imagine the size of the hive?
I told Pooh, 'You are what you eat,' but he just wouldn't listen.
I'd feel less concerned if we were hiking in an amusement park.
Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior?
Don’t move, Harold, or we’re toast.
They warned you to take out all the food you brought in!!
Quick- act diabetic.
Looks like Smokey's been doing more than smokin.
Look what followed your trail of dry breadcrumbs.
Don't panic, just slowly slide him some pancakes"
Raise your arms and look big or he'll attack your blood sugar level.
Careful.  It’s a bear trap.
This is what happens when you don't recycle
Honey, I can’t bear seeing him like that.
I told you not to bring the one from Costco.
They're probably filming toy story 6 near here
Honey, I--no, not you.
I guess all the Smoky spots were taken.
I'm not so sure he's as sweet as he looks.
Well he looks friendly, and perhaps even sweet.
Sorry to interrupt, but do you have any hot water I could run myself under?
You were right, we must have crossed the state line. If we were still in Oregon, he'd be organic.
We need to roll over and play bread."
Quick show him your bee keeper license
I know it's humiliating but the product placement fees pay for my cave mortgage.
Don't you think in regards to last week's contest, factoring in ORIGINALITY, all entries using the words, diversity, human resources and or 'a meal of some kind'  should have automatically been tossed?"
Smokey the Bear must be in California.
Leave the chamomile and back away slowly...
In Bear World, Halloween is the one day a year when a bear can dress up like a total cliche and no plaid-wearing hikers can say anything else about it.
Smokey quit without notice!
Don't worry--I'm  BPA-Free.
Unfortunately, Smokey had a previous commitment and couldn’t be here today.
You wouldn't have any English Breakfast, by chance, would you?
It’s a honey bear trap
See, I told you those weren't the poisonous mushrooms.
The Abominable Honey Bear
I guess this is where Costco gets their honey.
It says he's sweet, but I'm not buying it.
OK, no sudden movements. Back away slowly, and leave the Earl Grey.
Stop staring, I just got the need to get outside, breathe some fresh air and focus on who I am and who I want to be.
Once again Ann and Dave were terrorized by excessive sweeteners.
I bet he never gets a sore throat.
We’d better get out of here—he’s still a little raw.
Quick, hide the cornbread"
Slowly take the pancakes out of your backpack, put them on the ground, and then we quietly back away.
Can your GPS direct me to the Winnie the Pooh residence?
Not so sweet now am I?
We should have listened to Mrs. Butterworth.
No thanks, we prefer sugar substitutes."
They call them 'The St. Bernards of The Forest'."
It's okay, they run slowly.
I guess that "BEAR LEFT" sign back there was inaccurate.  The bear is still here!
Just order a jar and run when he goes to get it.
No worries. This kind of bear is slower than molasses.
How did it get out of the pantry?
Up close he looks even more viscous than I thought
US Forest Service now part of the Gig Economy.
What else did you buy at Costco?
My aunt squeezed one and wound up with 85 stitches.
Hit the dirt, cover your neck, and do NOT make waffle noises.
Perhaps I was a bit too quick to dismiss your childhood fantasies, Gretel.
I didn't think they could ever go bad.
Crap, we're toast!
Well, I certainly don't blame him for changing his occupation, but is his name still Smokey?
Oh no. I thought if we got off the grid, we'd be rid of the ads for a while.
Remember, only you can prevent low blood sugar.
Move very slowly. They’re generally sweet-natured, but  provoking it could put us in a sticky situation.
Quite the sticky situation we’ve gotten ourselves into!
Smokey took an early retirement.
We’re really roughing it—he’s not even artisanal.
Give him the chamomile and see if he'll leave us alone.
Doesn’t anybody recycle?
So we really are what we eat, huh?
I think we’re supposed to play diabetic.
Don't you think this pop-up ad thing has gone a little too far?
Don’t be fooled.  He thinks you’re a biscuit”
Play dead or make tea?
Don't trust him.  He is not as sweet as he looks.
Forget the bear spray, hand me a bagel.
Great costume, Bigfoot!
Do you have anything that's good for a bee sting?
Keep going. The lady with the maple syrup isn't too far.
Do you know where I can get a refill? Hive collapse disorder is killing me.
Don't run. Wave your arms and throw the toast.
Stay calm, it’s only a California Drizzly bear, he probably just wants our tea.
Honey the Bear says, "Only you can prevent colony collapse!"
No, not poo! Honey!!
Are you sure those mushrooms were safe to eat?
Stay calm or we're toast.
Rub my tummy and watch me squirt.
What did the ranger say about Drizzly Bears?
What type of mushrooms did you use in the sauce?
He might not have claws but he can still give us diabetes.
Careful!  There's a honey-glazed look in his eyes!
Sorry! ... I ..was. speaking to my husband.
I'm sure he's not as sweet as he looks.
Just leave the biscuits and back away slowly.
I'm here to settle the argument. I'm your honey bear.
You’re looking for the real killer? Better keep an eye out for Mrs. Butterfield.
Careful, there may be some samplers nearby she is protecting.
Now this is local honey.
You want authentic, you'll have to go off the trail.
If you see a bear in a red shirt and no pants, tell him you haven't seen me!
I' ve been moved from the U.S. Forestry Department to the Department of Agriculture and honeybee management.
I think he heard me call you Honey
Should we play dead, or make oatmeal?
I have a feeling he is not as sweet as he looks.
Did you bring the Stevia spray?
Even our national parks have become too commercial.
Did someone cough?
I think I know what happened to Mrs. Butterworth.
We can stop him with bread.  How much we got?
OMG!  Don't squeeze him.
He’s been on our trail since I opened the thermos of tea.
Excuse me .
Would that be pancake I smell??
Don't let him fool you. He's not as sweet as he looks.
Quick! The graham crackers!
I don’t care how sweet he is, I’m not squeezing him.
Sorry Honey, I was calling him “honey”.
And I thought artificial sweeteners were the real killers!
Honey, I think I'd better start calling you sweetie from now on.
I anticipated this sticky situation.  Quick: your granola
No sudden moves, dear. This could be a bit sticky.
That giant beehive we ran into back on the trail makes a whole lot more sense now.
This has slowly become an unbearably sticky situation
I may not be a real bear, but I play one on breakfast tables.
It's not local!
Do you still think this is a safe alternative to refined sugar?
*honey I ate the kids
The bees were much nicer about it.
Are you guys hiding from the bees too?
I can't And the Pope isn't Catholic!
He's Winnie's main squeeze.
I think he expects us to cook up some pancakes!
Eeek!...These Central Park survival courses just keep getting scarier and tougher
It's okay, I think he just wants our tea.
I told you we should be concerned about plastics in the environment.
Very slowly...hand him my tea thermos.
Um...Perhaps we shouldn't have eaten those wild chanterelles
Paul whispered "You know, a bear that size has enough honey to make a human taste good...... "
I read the survival book on this; lie on the ground and act like you're bread...
He looks like something you would see at Costco.
Naw, I'm not scared; it's chocolate moose season.
I don't care if it's natural. It's still sugar.
Freeze...one false move and we're his breakfast biscuit.
Fight, flight, or squeeze?
What doesn’t kill us, makes us stickier.
You should see Mrs. Butterworth
I think it’s better if we just tell everyone that we found the Sasquatch.
We shouldn't have eaten those mushrooms by the side of the trail.
Remember those tasty mushrooms we found?
I believe we're toast.
I think I ate the wrong mushrooms.
I felt better when we ran into the White Rock girl.
It senses we’re glucose intolerant.  Run!
Do you think it just wants a squeeze?
I told you a hike on Halloween is a mistake!
Whatever you do, don't give him a squeeze.
Guess he prefers raw and local too”
Be careful, Dave, it could be a honey trap.
He looks too sweet to be dangerous.
I think we're supposed to play bread.
Is that your stomach growling or his?
Oh my! Ranger Rick must be shopping at Costco again.
Did somebody say pancakes?
Only you can prevent cavities.
We're about to be smeared.
And what does the milk look like in this land?
No need to panic dear, it's just the latest eco-friendly marketing messaging stunt
This could get sticky.
Don't panic. It never goes bad.
If it attacks, should we fight back, play dead or swipe that last little bit of honey off its spout?
I guess 'you are what you eat' is especially true for bears
Oh bother!
You think I'm funny looking?
You should see my scat!
I don't think I can bring myself to use the spray.
No, I don't think it's a drizzly bear.
Let's agree right now never to go to Costco again -
And people wonder why there are more forest fires these days
Folks, keep to the right of the Molasses Swamp and the Candy Castle will be an intermediate level hike of 3 miles.
Without realizing it, the hikers found themselves in a very sticky situation.
I told you we weren’t too far from an IHOP!
He looks organic to me.
Quick, wave your big tea mug in the air!
Shout,wave arms,spread on toast? What?
This is awkward, but I guess I prefer the more butch Smokey.
Lost? Does a bear squirt in the woods?
Apparently the salmon run is over.
I forgot the tea bags.
Don't panic, he probably runs quite slowly.
Actually, I'm not your problem. I'm the condiment.
Look out! His drip is worse than his grip!
Of course she’s upset, you called her ‘Honey.’
What now, Christopher Robin?
What did you do to Yogi?
Quick, hand me the pancakes!"
Relax, I'm sure he's sweet.
Do either of you have a cigarette?
We might be toast.
We'd better run. Looks like he's popped his top.
Run! He’s about to blow our glycemic index!
Have you seen my Aunt Jemima?
Did you remember to take your insulin?
Damn! They warned us to be sure to carry wet wipes.
They do exist!
Christopher Robin still loves you, Pooh!
Oh, sorry! Is this a private conversation?
I'm surprised he's been able to keep up. I thought he'd be as slow as molasses.
Do we have to blame everything on global warming?
It’s either a party costume or those wild mushrooms we ate for lunch.
Mrs. Butterworth is actually the one you should fear.
He looks dangerous but he is actually very sweet.
Two unarmed hikers! Sweet!
If he catches us we're toast.
Be very careful! They may look cute enough to touch, but they’re full of processed sugars.
Most people are surprised that I’m not just a grocery shelf item!
We're in a bit of a sticky situation.
Any way you slice it, we're toast!
The next person who tries to put the squeeze on me can take a hike!
I think he is lost. This is Aumt Jemima's territory.
I’ve finally convinced the other bears to give up refined processed sugar.
Pretty sure the sign just said don't feed them. Go ahead and squeeze it.
Have you seen a fairy around here? She screwed me over big time.
Let's just hope he's slow as molasses.
Careful Tom, this could get sticky.
I told you that today’s the day the teddy bears have their picnic
You do know that calling him "Honey Bear" is cultural appropriation.
Carrie and Gary have found themselves in an unexpectedly sticky situation.
Well Jim, it came when you called
A tight squeeze? More like a sticky situation.
It's Smokey's day off.
Maybe you can join us for breakfast?
I miss the days they'd just maul you. Now they want to give you diabetes, too!
You said ‘Honey, take the little squirt.’ Now look!
Stay calm, he just wants our toast.
You never said these were magic mushrooms.
He sure looks smaller in the refrigerator!
Well, this could be a sticky situation...
Big Pancake Woods. It all makes sense now...
Be careful.  If he flips his lid, it's going to be a sticky situation.
It is okay, I am lost too.
A clear example of too much of a good thing.
So that's what Winnie the Pooh did when he grew up.
No, this is the Apiarian Trail.
Did either of you bring any biscuits?
I think it's a honey trap.
And they said the GMO genes wouldn't spread to the wild.
Are we supposed to play dead or climb a maple tree?
Have you seen Mrs. Butterworth?
Honey, are you sure we should have eaten those wild mushrooms?
You distract him while I sneak behind to check his Best By date.
Maybe he just wants to be squeezed!
Take heart. If you are what you eat...
Well, I guess it’s true; you are what you eat.
Remember when you said you were sure it was a Portabella?
Excuse me. You haven't seen a whole lot of bears
having a picnic around here have you ?
Wait, do you play dead if it's clover and fight back if it's wildflower, or is it the other way around?
It's O.K. He's locally sourced.
Looks like they left him in the microwave too long.
What did you think I do in the woods?
No sudden movements, or we're toast.
First the Kood-Aid man, now this?
What can I say? I like my people with honey.
What have you done with Mrs. Butterworth?
Don't look afraid or she'll think we're toast.
Honey, Don’t look directly at him.
We should have recycled.
Did it just say muffins?
He wants us to pollinate.
Put your bag down slowly… I think he can smell your biscuits
I posed for the 16 ounce size.
Drop the pancake mix and back away slowly.
This one isn’t nearly as dangerous as its offspring, the gummy.
Let's get moving, a nest full of pissed off bees can't be far behind!
I think I just Poohed!
I told you it didn't come out of bees
He is what he eats, I suppose.
Honey, I’m uncomfortable hiking with a bear behind.
It's tempting, but don't squeeze him.
Do you think the bear thinks we're toast?
Poor Pooh. I guess you really do become what you eat.
You're supposed to be the man....
you squeeze him to see what happens.
I think she smells our fear. And our Darjeeling
It looks like a healthier substitute but you should still avoid direct eye contact.
He looks sweet.
Oh no -- the flies will be right behind him
Do you think his hat unscrews?
Talk about a sticky situation
Don't be fooled.  He is not as sweet as he looks.
Frank, I’ve asked you before to stop taking things so literally; this is not what I meant when I said I wanted my honeypot.
My mom always told me there would be consequences for leaving the lid off.
Careful, he looks raw
Do you think she thinks we squeezed one of her babies?
They're usually not dangerous unless you pack one of the kid-sized portions.
Don't worry about me.  The bees are angry as hell.
I wonder if its organic?
Quick, do you have any toast?
I know we're in the woods, but how can we be sure it's really organic?
They celebrate Halloween too?!
Me scary?  Just wait until you meet my brother Gummy.
You don’t need to be concerned.  I’m locally sourced.
you know what they say, you are what you eat.
Say, have you folks seen a pancake running around out here?
No, really! It's me, your kitchen honey jar, all grown up, and ready to squeeze you back.
Edna & Harry found themselves in quite the sticky situation.
He says he's looking for Mrs. Butterworth.
Does a bear stick in the woods?
We're in deep and sticky trouble
Best to not Pooh,Pooh him.
Play dead and you're toast.
Careful...this could get sticky.
Back away, don’t look him in the eye, this could get sticky.
Her cubs are gummy bears so watch your step.
Don't be afraid, they're really sweet on the inside.
Just open those backpacks slowly and no one has to get hurt here.
I told Winnie to be careful with his wishes!
Sorry to bother you, but could you show me the way back to the nearest Whole Foods?
My financial guy said  run, if we ever sense a bear market ahead!
I told you not to eat the gummies.
Relax!  It's just the honey bear.
Shall we ask him to breakfast?
Maybe we have stumbled into the Bear Witch Project?
Honey, you scared me!
Oh my God! He smells the English muffins!
Don't worry I hear it moves slowly
Get rid of the ham.
Why didn't you tell me earlier about your new squeeze, Honey?
Should we be more afraid of the bear or the carbs?
Squeeze me. It's free.
I thought you said there might be honey bees on this trip.
I've heard that if we just give him an english muffin, he'll leave us alone
Lets not eat anymore of those wild mushrooms.
Nevermind the bear spray, grab the trial mix.
You said he'd still be in a honey comb-a!
I think we need to take a closer look at those mushrooms.
For the last time, I'm not taking my top off.
Stay calm, it's dangerous but not as bad as a honey badger
I'm allergic. Hand me my Epi-pen.
I thought the brochure said watch our for honey bees.
We may be in a sticky situation
It's weird seeing him outside the farmer's market.
Honey, it's honey!
If she gets closer, we're toast.
You play dead. I’ll run.
I can never remember--should we run, play dead, or make toast?
Shhhh, don't call me Honey.
Back away slowly like molasses.
Careful, he doesn’t look local.
I don't think he will fit in the bear-safe container.
I just wanted a hug.
Bob, why is the bear looking at my pack; did you put the tea and hot cider in there?
Im extending my expiration date.
"Uh-oh. We're toast."
While he's around you should probably call me by a different nickname.
He isn't pissed off about forest fires. He's pissed off about breakfast.
I told you not to put it in the microwave!
One hug and I'm all yours.
Honey… Those mushrooms we had for breakfast, where did you get them?
It's not what you think, Sue Bee. This is my father.
And here we are without toast!
He just comes off as, like, aggressively sweet.
Give him a little squeeze and he’ll go away.
Don't run! The trail book says hold it upside down and squeeze it.
You look like you were expecting the bear with the toilet paper.
Oh No! We're not falling for the old grisly bear disquised in a honey bear dispenser trap.
Another Costco impulse purchase?
Make sure your wallet is secure. He has sticky fingers.”
Uh-oh. He just blew his lid.
“Hi there! I’ll swap you some honey for an ounce of Panama Red.”
You guys smoke?
I think this bear is sweet.
Would it be rude to ask for a picture?
Don't worry, it's organic.
Well, I guess you were right--these definitely are psilocybin mushrooms.
Dad, do you remember that joke...I don't have to outrun the Honey Bear...I just have to outrun you?
Wait... So honey isn't vegan?
I'd heard Smokey had fallen on hard times, but I had no idea he'd gotten hooked on the sweet stuff.
I told you GMOs would eventually turn on us.
Do you still have that piece of toast from breakfast?
Run, you know I'm allergic.
Be careful! It looks processed.
Watch out, it gets on EVERYTHING
He keeps muttering something about Smokey and Winnie and being late for a family reunion.
No, not maul, just gonna turn you upside down and squeeze. okay, then maul.

Don't touch it, it's a trick.  If we do, we'll stick, and the bears will eat us honey glazed.
I squeezed it.
Maybe if he feeds us he'll go away.
No poo poo Pooh!
OK, here's the plan: I'll get the bread out and you tackle him and give him a big bear hug.
You're too late. I finished my tea an hour ago.
No, we don’t want to save 15%
I know he looks naturally sweet and high in antioxidants— we just need to be aware of death by a thousand calories.
Honey bear, honey bear, what do you see?"
"I see a couple of hipsters staring at me!
Please, take our oatmeal and let us go!"  Phoebe, age
Don't worry, the bees are hibernating.
Remember. Only you can prevent unsweetened tea.
What? I'm living my brand.
Oh shit, we forgot to clean the cap again.
I told you we should have used something else to bind the granola.
This situation could get a little sticky.
Is this what they meant by 'a taste of the great outdoors'?
Lions, and tigers, and genetically modified honey, oh my!
Well, at least we're gonna die to a pun.
Should we tell him Halloween was last week?
Oh,no! He smells the pancakes we just ate!
I am never going on another Bumble date ever again.
At least one of us will have a delicious glaze.
Stick to me and bear right.
Please tell me you brought the cheese and bread.
Whether he's real or not, I sure hope he is full!
Don't move and try not to look like a biscuit.
Make eye contact, but don't be threatening, look big and get out your insulin.
Yes I’d call this a sticky situation Kevin.
Forget the Winnie the Pooh crap, this is serious.
I must admit this is a very subtle product placement.
He's no Smokey.
This is a real sticky situation
Oh no, carbs!
Uh oh, a sticky situation looms...
Honey, it's not what it looks like. We're just friends.
If we run we'll be toast, honey.
I used to have nightmares about this
I did NOT say honey, bare with me.
They say the fellow who created the bottle is now a millionaire.
We really need to lay off the bong!
I told you not to eat all the trail mix.
Just back up slowly, don't make eye contact, and don't say anything about biscuits.
As long as we don’t boil him he can’t move.
He must be a hit with the ladies.
Quick, dear, make him a cup of hot tea with lemon!
Uh, Christopher, Winnie has grown and is dangerous.
Organic maple syrup for us, thanks.
It's either those wild mushrooms we just ate or creative commercialism.
I guess it's true: you really are what you eat.
Honey, we might need to start using a new pet name.
It’s just honey, not a real bear.
Teddy's not here. Can I take a message?
You go left, I'll go right, then we'll meet at the front and cancel the Costco membership once and for all
By any chance have you folks seen a rather large waffle here abouts?
Should we get the pepper spray or some toast?
Only you can prevent sticky situations.
I don’t think your bear spray will get us out of this sticky situation.
Where's your Aunt Jamima now?
Don't move!  It's the man eating, scientifically engineered, product placement bear, designed as his own condiment.
Drop the peanut butter, keep the energy bars, and do not, repeat, do not, call me ‘Honey’
Lions and Tigers and Honey Bears...Oh my.
Looks like we're in a beary sticky situation.
See! I told you plastic was everywhere!
She looks sweet but I still don’t trust her.
Uh-oh. That's a very rare species in this part of the country. Did you bring any biscuits we can use to distract him?
So THAT’S why the bee tree was empty!
Listen, Goldilocks.  Not only will you find that the bed in your AirBNB cabin is TOO SOFT ... it'll be TOO STICKY, too!
Good thing I brought lemon
I don't think this is the best time to ask if it's locally sourced or not.
No, you are not in the 100-acre wood!
You tell him I'm your Honey, not his honey.
Careful, he's still right-side up.  That means he's pretty full.
No, No,No, you only have to worry about the Honey Badger, he is the nastiest.
Do you think he gave up fighting forest fires?
Make yourself as big as possible and walk backwards.
I think they say it’s best to show no fear when adding to tea.
Now THIS is a seriously sticky situation.
Want some honey, honey?
Quick, break out the English muffins.
Please stop calling me honey while we hike
I meant, "Honey, Bear with me!"
I know we should back up slowly but I have an irresistible urge to squeeze him.
Watch out—did you ever see 'Drizzly Man'?
I TOLD you the peanut butter sandwiches were a bad idea...
He looks angry... and organic.
Have you by any chance seen my brother, "CBD Gummy?"
Can you please direct me to the next Beehive?
Be careful, they're known to look sweet.
I told you dropping acid while hiking was a bad idea.
OMG! It’s the love child of Smokey Bear and Mrs Butterworth!
I didn't know bears could be so sweet."   "Or slow.
Things are about to get sticky.
Don't panic, he's 100% local.
Squeeze me, I dare you.
The cuckoo clock was only the first clue that this is not a real wildlife hike.
Surely PETA doesn't approve.
Don't move! It's looking for a waffle.
Looks are deceiving; he's all bottled up.
Looks like another gene got out of the lab.
Shouldn't he be at a picnic ?
I'm doing a study to see if I catch more hikers with honey or a placebo
Don't pull any bread out.
Only you can prevent Splenda.
Smoky gave her the outfit for her birthday.
I've heard wild honey isn't dangerous
Don't be alarmed. I've read it's mostly high fructose corn syrup.
Uh oh.... the little ones are back in our cabinet.
What's with the look?  Did you think that all we do is poop in the woods?
No thanks. We only use raw, unfiltered clover honey that is locally and ethically sourced.
I knew you had a little honey on the side.
She looks angry—we must have interrupted teatime for her cubs.
We either convince it we aren't toast or we are toast.
Is this your nightmare or mine?
Brand marketing is getting so out of hand.
I've never seen honey this local before."
Couldn't you just give him a squeeze?
If he doesn't crystalize soon, I think we'll be toast.
DO NOT mention we saw her kids playing with the Butterworth kids in the park earlier...
Don't let him see that you're hungry!
Breakfast is served
Everybody knows bears sit in the woods.
We should back up slowly, speak soothingly, and try not to look like biscuits.
He seems so sweet.
Please tell me we aren't standing between her and her biscuits.
I think he’s upset that he’s almost empty.
I have been hiding since Chinese government came for Winnie the Pooh.
I told you not to call me "Honey" in these woods!
Don't worry, babe. Honey bears don't eat vegans.
Deep in the forest of  You Are What You Eat.
Just give him your bees and walk away slowly.
Just then, our intrepid explorers found themselves in a sticky situation.
The ingredient label is the scariest part.
Branding is everything these days.
This is exactly what Mrs. Butterworth warned us about!"
Would you like to have your tea now?  And how were the mushrooms?
I don’t suppose you packed a bag of ants.
Should we introduce her to Winnie?  They’d be a perfect match!
Pardon me, but have you seen a life-size cup of tea come this way?
Don’t be fooled by his disguise. He’s not very sweet.
Pardon me. Have you seen a really large beehive around here?
And I guess you don't believe there's a Santa Claus either!
Nice and easy, Hank.  I think we can out run him.  
Honey Bears are very slow.
Tea, anyone?
Did you bring the Earl Grey bear repellant?
Did you pack the Bisquick?
Stay calm, walk backwards slowly, and try not to look like a piece of buttered toast.
Quick, pass me a biscuit.
I told you that sign said Brobdingnag.
True Romance!! Right??
Don’t worry. He’s only looking for waffles.
There WERE bees, before you two showed up.
Quick- roll over and play "bread"!
Don't worry, she looks sweet
Need a sugar fix?  Hundred percent pure...
Wait, I forget, if it's a honey bear are we supposed to play dead, fight back or just lick him?
They said we would feel better if we bought local honey
Honey, I think we're in a sticky situation here...
This could get sticky - back away slowly so we're not toast!
Don't worry.  He can't attack until he clears his spout.
You get the biscuits . I’ll trick him into standing on his head.
My goodness, this is a sticky situation isn’t it.
Do I smell one of my children in your backpack!
Did we bring biscuits?
Pancakes!  Give Me Pancakes!
Well, I heard that the ‘sticky situation’ is much better than the ‘sweet surrender’.
Brown honey bear worries wasps
Excuse me, but have you seen any pancakes or waffles?
Did I not pinch you when my brother suggested we swing by Costco to get gas on the way to the camp site?
Freeze!  We run and we're toast....
Don't worry, dear. It's organic.
This product placement business is getting ridiculous.
Watch out Ted! He's high glycemic
Great, what's next, life-size animal crackers?
I think this is what they call a squeezable moment.
May I offer my services? I heard you’re on a fly-catching hike.
He looks like a mama's boy
Leave the leftover toast and maybe he'll stop following us.
Just hand over your carbohydrates and there'll be no trouble.
Quick! Raise your arms and ask for toast!
Yo, who you callin' honey bear?
Looks like we’ve  got ourselves in a sticky situation here.
Hand me your water bottle
Another sticky situation.
Quick! Play like you're cornbread!
I don't like the way that bear's been sticking right to us the whole time.
Don’t be a fool, honey.  Just give him the peanut butter and bread!
Don't move, or we'll be toast.
I think Winnie the Pooh had an illicit affair with one of his honey jars.
I have misplaced the honey jar Lid somewhere. Can you please spare your water bottle Cap for a while?
Are you looking for the Teddy Bear’s Picnic?
we're local ,he's local , what's to worry
I didn't know they were native to regions outside the kitchen.
Looks like you two stumbled into a sticky patch.
Wanna squeeze me honey?
He said he needs a hug.
Either he can smell our fear or we can smell his sweetness.
Hold him upside-down.  I can't wait to squeeze him."
Now do you believe the buzzing we heard was from a giant beehive?
Thanks for the offer but we're both diabetics, so we'll just be moving through.
I was wrong. It's not a prosthetic.
Don't let him see your english muffin.
Don't touch him!  Your hands will be sticky all day.
Don't worry -- I'm organic.
Watch out, it's a honey trap!
What? Everyone needs a sponsor!
Either that's a lifetime supply of honey
or we're in big trouble.
Winnie the Pooh has really changed "
I dunno.  He LOOKS sweet, but....
Who's up for a big surprise?
I told you not to speak so loudly about preferring jam.
Watch your backpack; he's got sticky figures.
I think Smokey the Bear went rogue.
I thought it was supposed to be a St. Bernard ...
One step closer to my sticky cubs and you're in big trouble!
Now, slowly take out my thermos of herbal tea...
It's a trademark bear...careful!
This would be less awkward if you had a giant piece of toast.
Maybe we should return baby honey bear to his mama.
That old lady filled with syrup warned us about this.
Honestly, I think we’re in more danger from the giant mug of tea, that he travels with!
Looks like we are toast now.
I'm not eating anymore of the mushrooms we find.
Honey, did you bring the moist towelettes?
Maybe we should have double checked those wild mushrooms we ate for lunch today.
Forget About POOH BEAR .... He RETIRED !!
Says his name is Smokey.
Sticky the bear reminds, "Hallucinogens are not recommended for forest hikes."
Honey, it's a trap.
He seems sweeter than Smoky!
OK, a new PR buzz for Smokey?
It's OK Dad, he just wants to "Bee".
I told you we were being followed.
He must want us to give him a refill...
If we play dead we may avoid a sticky situation
Well, what the hell did you think a honey bear would look like, Winnie the Pooh?
It's okay! We're vegan.
Very slowly, open the thermos of t-e-a.
Jim, when I called you "honey" a bit too loud, this happened.
It's okay, Honey, he's vegan.
Honey, I’ve been seeing someone else.
He’s only harmless if you don’t count diabetes.
He says he's a colonoscocopist .
Should we try it? I've never had organic honey.
Oh sorry, we don't have any toast.
Do we play dead or make tea?
He appears to be the giant  economy size!
Her presence was terrifying.....but Katie and Phil got lucky. Attracted by a biscuit badger nearby, she oozed back into the woodland.
I don't think we should've eaten those mushrooms.
No,we're NOT having pancakes this morning.
Term of endearment? This is exactly why I told you to cut the "honey bear" nonsense!
I hope they're friendlier in the land of milk.
Quick, yell ‘Bulk sale!’
Who do you think we’d see in the woods, Mr. Peanut?
Stay still. I think you have a bee hive in your bonnet.
You can't squeeze past me so buzz off!
Have you seen my husband, Smokey?
Looks like the Pooh overdosed on the sweet stuff again.
Tea time.
Did somebody call my name?
No, it's Sticky the Bear.
The Smokey thing doesn’t seem to play with the younger generation.
It says high fructose corn syrup right there. Terrifying.
A word to the wise, he may ask for a hug. Don't fall for it, unless you want to get in a sticky mess.
Uh, Dad, Where did you find those mushrooms for your special ‘forest omelettes?‘
Take me to your larder.
Peas? No, we don’t have peas.
Barry, honey, I can explain.
Frankly, he's scarier than a real bear.
Well, the guide did say that this was an intro level hike...
I told you to bring whole grain toast and peanut butter!
Never mind the pepper spray, just throw him a graham cracker.
I told you, I'm not your honey.
Oh no.  I told him this was a platonic date.
I guess we are what we eat.
Don't worry.  I am is viscous, but I will not eat you.
It may be a trap !
It's true.  Sometimes you do eat the bear.
My husband, Smokey, has been so busy in California i’ve been trying to help fillin fir him.
Run, it’s not Smokey.  He’s the sweet one.
Where did you get that honey from?
These pop-up balloons kill the ambiance.
Hkenye
That red cap is mine.
Really, Doug? 'Honey Bear'?"
I never remember: run, bang our pots, run or make tea?
I think it smells our diabetes.
Make yourself look sweeter than he!
Portage is such sweet sorrow.
Watch out! It looks like a honey trap!
Sweet, sweet revenge
He looks sweet but this might be a sticky situation.
No, honey, YOU tell him!
The ranger said he shouldn’t be aggressive if you don’t mention the drip.
Smokey Bear’s man squeeze”
If we don't move, he won't ooze.
About time they did something to catch all the nasty flies around here.
Let's ignore her;  I have type 2 Diabetes.
Honey Shrunk the Kids Again... “I wish they would stop making sequels”
You should have used a different sweetener.
Get the scanner gun...
Right, like I would eat YOU. I'd rather eat myself.
I don't know, he doesn't say 'squeezable' to me.
I knew the bees were evolving to better protect themselves, but this is way beyond anything we were thinking.
Do you think we should climb a tree, play dead or make toast?
I told you we should have had those mushrooms you found identified first!
Maybe if you burped a tupperware container it might scare him away
If only we had packed that ten pound tub of butter.
Shhhhhh...this could get sticky.
So that's how Smokey Bear got diabetes.
Won't You Bee Mine
Careful.  Autumnal honey is unpredictable.
I'm not as sweet as you think i am...
Sadly Smokey passed away, I am his sweet widow.
But he seems so sweet...
I can't remember if you're supposed to run or stay still if they drizzle on you.
The only thing you have to fear is Diabetes.
The carb cravings just never let up!
How can we get this home?
But I'm 100% organic, non-GMO and gluten-free!
He may be squeezable and oozing sweetness, but things could get sticky.
Once again we’ve gotten ourselves into a sticky situation.
-“Honey Bear!!!!!!!”
-“Yes, Schnookems?”
There goes our sugar cleanse.
Most people don't pay for the Honey Bear Sherpa
I think we're supposed to make ourselves look bigger....and sticky.
Let’s make a run for it, even though the bear seems so sweet.”
Ohh. Forgot to mention. Bob and I were concerned about the campsites being over crowded. So he rented this costume. It was all they had on such a short notice. I anticipate us having no issues finding a spot this year!
This one looks sweet!
What is that?"  "I think it is what they called Plastic.  The extinction of plastic was a century ago."   "I can't believe its still here!
Remember, only you can prevent apiary blight!
I'm your honey bear, and he's your honey.  Can we all hibernate together?
I think it's the bears trying to change their image.
Do you suppose it is a Honey Trap?
Don't worry, they only come out at tea time.
He LOOKS sweet, but I dunno. I say we move on.
You guys down to swing?
Sue and Ted could no longer handle the forest mushroom hallucinations.
I don’t think those were basic mountain mushrooms we just ate.
He must have smelled our mustard dog.
We should be ok. The Cubs are still at Denney's.
I sure could use a hug.
I think I've found a new main squeeze.
Hey! You guys aren't supposed to bring food out here!
No means no honey
These bears are very dangerous as they are no longer vegan.
It might be a good time to get out the peanut butter and crackers.
No Honeybear, it's not what you think!
Just because it’s here in the forest doesn’t mean it’s organic!
Not sure he's really that sweet.
Pour a cup of  tea, and then back away slowly.
No, we prefer Splenda.
Just back away slowly. And hide the pancakes.
Death by honey isn't as sweet as it sounds.
Stay calm, he smells our tea.
We shouldn’t have ignored that witch at breakfast.
I told you we should have brought the bear spray.  Now, we'll be all sticky.
This is very surprising. They told us there were no bears in this state.
Honey!!! What are you doing here?
What's become of Pooh Bear
Has anyone seen a lying, no good user that goes by the name Pooh?
This is why I don't like camping in Butterworth Woods.
Don’t worry. He looks sweet to me.
Oh pooh, honey.  No real bears here.
That’s not the Winnie the Pooh I know!
Don't worry. It is only the gummy ones that are hostile.
He doesn’t look happy to see us, no matter how naturally sweet you think he is.
Don't panic...He looks sweet
If a vegan walks in the woods and gets attacked by a bear, can they fight back?
No, I don't know anyone named Pooh.
Carl, don't move. He can smell your A1C.
Did you see any waffles go by this way?
Well I'm a vegan, so he can't be mad at me.
I told you honey isn't vegan.
Little did they know what saying "honey" in the wild entailed.
At least you hear Mister Softee coming.
Squeeeeze me!
Lie down, don’t move and pretend you’re bread.
Smokey doesn't live here anymore.
He's all crystalyzed. We need to get him into a hot water bath asap. Where's there a hot spring?
This is the second tea party we don't want to join.
Smokey has the day off.
Honey, this isn’t what it looks like!
I’ve cut out the middle man.
Don’t worry, he’s very sweet.
That costume isn't fooling anyone, buster.
Do we run or do we make tea?
Hi, I'm looking for the local Pancake restaurant.
He must be the super size one they advertised from Costco!
I knew my sweet tooth would come back to bite me.
My husband knows better than to not have closed and wiped your nozzle."
Let's see what comes out if I squeeze YOU!
We're all lost, looking for the story we belong in.
Yeah, I can be squeezed, but don't even think about it!
Should we offer him pancakes?
Have you seen my bees?
I told you, dropping acid before our hike was a very bad idea!
Let’s throw him an Eggo and run like hell!
I read about this, we have to buzz loudly to establish ourselves as dominant.
Only you can prevent dried-out honey containers
Hand me the pepper spray and a large buttered biscuit
Quick! You distract it with the gluten-free artisanal bread, while I get out the cultured butter!
Can you please check if it is Bleeding from my head?
Run! It's going to kill our keto diet!
We do have one of her cubs...
We were trying to leave civilization behind.
No, I thought he was with you!
Didn’t the ranger say it was slower than molasses?
There is an image that is going to stick with me for a while.
Try to look like asparagus.
Drop Santa Claus, Babe, and you'll see how sweet it can be.
We got cheated!! All this time we were sold  bear honey not bee honey!!!
We left all the toast at base camp!
As I already explained, Smokey is in California.
Well, yes I did.  But I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.
I told you we shouldn't go hiking on Rosh Hashanah.
How could you Bert, you know where you get your honey.
no money, no honey!
Honey, I don't think we should have eaten those mushrooms
It’d bee sweet if only you’d bear with me, honey!
I don't think he is from our nectar of the woods.
Don't worry, its vegan
Quick! Offer it a biscuit.
Quick, pretend your in a sugar coma!
I don't know of we should run, or bring out our nuts and crackers.
We must be near a Whole Foods.
This is a bit of a sticky situation.
For the first time in my life, I wish my name wasn't "Honey".
Any idea where the tea party is?
Someone missed the #metoo seminar.
Oh God, I knew we would die from non-organic honey!
You are right Phil, I will stop calling you honey bear outside of the house"
Now this is a sticky situation...
You should see the size of my sweet spot.
I can't bear any more of your waffling.
Are you sure those edibles were just for 'relaxation'?
He's harmless, but leave the giant syrup lady alone.
Ok, we stick together and try not to look like a hot cup of tea.
One wrong move and we're toast.
I told you to look at the expiration date. But you never listen.
I always knew he was organic.
A weekend out of the city and we still can't escape aggressive commercialism.
I don't know... there was this witch and I said, "I feel like some honey"
Quick, boil some hot tea!
I know he seems angry but maybe he's sweet on the inside
He may look sweet, but I wouldn't trust him.
Run Bill! I guess it's bear seasoning already!
Quit calling me 'Honey', I don't even know you!
Go ahead, call me cute.
These bears look vaguely familiar but I can’t quite place it.
Want to give me a squeeze?
Don’t worry.  There’s no way a honey bear can spoil a perfectly good afternoon
Ummm, honey?!?
Just back away slowly.  If he charges,  curl into a ball like a piece of baklava, and I'll sprinkle walnuts on you.
Um, yeah...definitely not a porcini.
Hey, campers, may I join you?  I'm great on biscuits.
Honey let's go, this guy in the hat is really creeping me out.
No complaining: I told you to wear your cap.
Look honey, it's a bear!
Well, we are still sugar free.
Remembering, don’t run or make a lot of noise . If you do things could get real sticky
I preferred it when we got honey from bees
I’d sure feel a lot safer with Smokey
Too much for a second date?
You're positive that those mushrooms weren't psychedelic?
What was in those brownies?
I am sorry to startle you but might you have a spoon?
The family is branching out to stop Forest Fires.
Oh Honey Bears do s*** in the woods..
Do you think he accepts maple syrup?
Who has sticky fingers?
Did you bring the pancake mix?
You were expecting Little Miss Muffit?
Don't touch it.  It's a bear trap.
Almost as judgmental as your mother.
When I said you’re my big squeeze honey bear, I meant him.
I'm not him. I don't even know what a Pooh is.
I told you this was a gluten free trail.
Cool couples costumes, guys.
What happened to Smokey?
Excuse me, but do you have any toilet paper?
I didn't mean to insult you. I bet other bears find you very attractive.
I’m substituting for Smokey, the Bear,” who’s on emergency assignment. “Please, don’t hurt the bees.
One of you called out 'honey bear', the other said 'Sweetie'. Well, here I am. What do you want?
Locavores! Where’s your food co-op now?
Mrs. Smokey?
But the ranger said everything would be vegan-friendly.
I never said granola was good for you.
I think we ate the wrong wild mushrooms!
mmmm, stuffed waffles. Sweet!
Do we make noise or play dead with this one?
What do you mean Smoky lost his lease?
They all think they are comedians.
Don't worry, he's stuck.
Don't make any sudden squeezing motions.
I told you not to step on that bee."



'
Honey, I'm home.
You are what you eat I guess
Honey, let’s get out of here.
Haven't we had the conversation about boundaries...?
Even the wildlife is used to make a buck in advertising. 
Nothing is sacred in Trumps regime.
Aww, he looks sweet.
Damn  plastic.
He said it's a magic cap he got from his friend, Frosty.
The guidebook says to either play dead, or scoop the dollop of honey with your finger.
Don't worry, I'm all natural.
It'll need more than simple sugars to survive the winter.
I think we're standing between her and her breakfast cereal.
Tell Smokey I'm through with the "But Honey, I have to work late at the Ranger station" line
Ah for crying out loud
OK, don't panic....SLOWLY hand me the instant oatmeal.
Should we flip and squeeze him from the bottom or just run?
Let’s invite him for tea.
Why are hanging out with the dude with the beard?
Mary: "Oh my god, how terrifying!"

Jeff: "Why cause he's a bear?"

Mary: "No, I suspect it isn't non-GMO honey."
The bees are really getting serious about gueriella marketing.
I can’t bear another hug !  Last time he wanted me to be HIS honey
Just say we’re vegans and it will go away.
If he thinks we're toast, we're toast.
It’s not as if we’re apiarists!
Don't be afraid honey, he looks very sweet
Yes, be afraid.  I'm not as sweet as I look.  I've been unfairly labeled.
Quick, where's that empty jar?
I think he wants us to clean his nozzle
I have a feeling a really small Smokey the Bear is in your kitchen cabinet...
You distract her while I steep the 40-pound teabag.
I hope he's as sweet as he looks.
I'd be a lot less scared if that was non-GMO, fair trade, certified organic agave.
But you said I was your one and only honey bear.
It's the Ghost of Pooh Sticks past.
All the better to eat you with my dear....
I think he wants us to keep away from the wildflowers!
I told you to stop calling me honey!
Looks like he will be sticking to us.
Geez... for a minute I thought that was a big bottle of mustard.
I don't HAVE a hot cross bun.  Do you suppose he'd like some trail mix?
No, sorry, we haven't seen any gummie cubs around here.
If you were looking for your honey boo-boo, you’ve found me.
Y'know, bearhugs can be really sweet.
Whatever you do, don't run... or put the kettle on.
I knew a bear would crystallize before our eyes!
'Of course I've washed my hands.'
It'll be ok. I've heard they're actually very sweet.
Well, this will catch the flies for sure, Froggy.
Smokey went out to the coast to picket PG&E.
Curl up and act like a biscuit!
Just don't get between her and her combs!
Careful! Don't get between her and her cub-cake
If you go into the woods today, you'd better bring slices of toast.
OK, it's cute. But the cap still drips.
Honey... what is that?
I think that he is asking for a Heimlich maneuver.
It's the bees, Carl- and they're pissed.
Has either of you met a boy walking through this wood named Christopher?
Don't panic, he's as slow as molasses.
It's best to play dead. You can't outrun diabetes.
Hey, I heard there are some crackers around here.
Just turn slowly and offer him our toast and milk
Where's Aunt Jemima when we need her?
Honey, wheres my super suit?
For just $100 I can provide you guaranteed safety and security.
How about a little squeeze, honey?
Play dead or we’re toast.
And don’t call me Squirt!
It's nutt'n Honey, she's really sweet.
Quick! Lay down and pretend we're waffles!
Fine to use the honey....0nly what do we do about recycling the plastic container?
Sweet fucking Jesus.
Who ordered  lifesize?
I always wondered where they got the model.
I'm frightened, but also hungry for chicken nuggets.
He's restaurant size.
No, thank you, I was talking to my husband.
Careful, it’s probably not pasteurized.
Climate change is worse than we thought.
Don't move or you will be sweeten"
If you hurt us, you'll find yourself in hot water.
This one we can run from, right?
Whatever you do, don't panic - just lie flat and look like a waffle.
Whatever you do, don’t run, stand up tall, and have your wet wipes ready.
Do you think he needs the bathroom?
I know he’s sweet, but he really gives me the creeps.
This is about to be an unbearably sticky situation.
He grew out of the Hunny phase then?
I thought the bees were going to the problem.
Uh, I think it is tea time.
Fine -- whatever! I did say 'Honey, bear!' But it's not the time for semantics.
Are you sure I should climb the beanstalk wearing this costume?
Maybe he’s sweeter than he looks.
Not only is it patronizing to call me 'honey', right now it's redundant.
I TOLD you we should have brought tea!
Maybe all he wants is a cup of tea?
Relax, it's not an aggressive species. They're actually very sweet.
Honey Bear just takes what it wants.
Can you tell me which way to Starbucks?
I don't think it's organic.
Do I LOOK indigenous to this area?
You know I hate it when you call me honey bear. No, look!
I shoulda known my sugar daddy had a honey bear.
Oh no, it must have smelled the tea brewing.
He looks sweet but I wouldn't get too close.
Be calm, he won't hurt us... Just try not to look like a pancake
That's a sweet decoy.
Quick, a piece of bread!
Can you tell me where the bees have gone? Are you out here looking for them, too?
You think this is weird? Wait until you taste the creek water.
I hear they just kill flies.
If you had called me Robert, he would not have shown up!
Honey, I think he following us.
Lost hikers look like hot cakes to me."
And I thought billboards were bad.
They say just Bee natural
Do we play dead or act hungry?
You don't have to out run it, just spread it over toast.
But I thought I was your main squeeze
Have you seen my children anywhere?
It's eerie the way he just keeps humming Tupelo Honey.
Everything tastes better with honey on it.
Look dear it's honey bear ; he has to be a sweetie!
Guess Smokey’s got the day off
He had tracked the Butterworths for days, and now he would have his revenge.
I told you about him before. “My Maine squeeze.”
Do NOT do your pouring tea mime routine!
Be careful-he’s not BPA free.
Let's get out of here before we end up in a sticky situation.
So much for the great unsullied wilderness!
Sweet!
I have the crackers. Do we need to worry about the bees?
He wants to know if you’ve seen the plastic cap to the honey.
Can we squeeze him for our oatmeal?
Oh my God! The legendary Enema Bear is real! I thought that was just a NatGeo ratings ploy!
We have Purel, but no Charmin.
I don't know if this will play out like A Quiet Place, or like The Bee Movie.
Let’s hope he’s just here for the teddy bears’ picnic,
.
'Well well well, look who's back.
Ive been waiting for you Goldi.
Sorry pal  we have history, 
I know exactly how she likes it.'
Got bread?
Can I borrow your brush? I’ve misplaced my honeycomb.
I understand that he has kisses sweeter than wine.
Huh. I guess you really ARE what you eat.
I know the National Park Service has to cover its costs with outside advertising dollars, but sometimes it really detracts from the authenticity of the wildlife.
My colleague down the river has Maple Syrup
You’ve walked into a very sticky situation!
My friend Pooh sent me, are there any more pancakes?
My god! Look at those carbs.
He seems sweet, but, I mean, he's leaking brain fluid!
I think we just found ourselves in a sticky situation.
O.K. Einstein...How do you expect to get us out of this sticky mess
I don't trust him. He's the big, bad wolf in disguise.
What do you mean he looks sweet?
Another clover. Where are all the wildflowers?
How’s about you ditch the tree hugger and get with a real man? How long does he last? Five minutes? I last INDEFINITELY.
If calling you 'honey' did not bring me enough trouble already
oh bother.  have you seen my friend badger?
Pardon me.  You wouldn't happen to have any granola, would you?
Hired as an inside sales guy, but failed to meet monthly quotas.
Oh crap! That noise we heard? 
Must've been a microwave loosening this dude up.
Do you see what I see, honey?"..
Sneak surprise! Can it be a Trojan Grizzly in Honey Bear's Fur?
Do you know what it’s like being chased by bears all the time?
I'm sorry I didn't believe your enchanted forest campfire story, Run!
Honey, we are in a bit of a sticky situation."
How about a hug from your honey bear!
I told you not to put those mushrooms in the pancakes.
We should have taken our chances with Mrs. Butterworth
Looks like Teddy is still in costume!
I can never figure out how to dose edibles.
Hansel,  not again.
Hard to believe that's Yogi's wife
Just don't call me 'Honey'  'til we get home.
Don’t worry, I heard it’s not even real.
If you two run into a Christopher Robin up ahead you tell that kid and his gluttonous friend Winnie that this is the Ninety-Nine Acre Wood and they need to turn around!
I told you to run him under hot water before we left home.
I don’t know, he doesn’t look organic
And here I thought honey came from bees....
It doesn't have any legs so I think we can outrun it.
Watch out, Honey.
Here I am, a giant bear-shaped honey container and yet you two hipster-yuppies still find a way to make yourselves the biggest stereotypes in the forest.
He says, "The money's much better than the wildfire gig."
Oh no, is that what's killing the bees?
We don't need to run; Honey Bears are notoriously slow.
You left the stove on.
Honey, this is a sticky situation!
She looks a bit crystallized. Maybe we should start a fire to loosen her up...
Can’t you just try to look a little scared? You know how sensitive these Gen Z bears’ egos are.”

As long as he stays point up we don’t have to worry about dribbles.
We're gonna need a bigger pancake...
As scary as he is, I could really go for some tea about now.
You humans stole my children and sold them for ridiculous prices at Sprouts! Now you must pay so I can buy Sprouts!
Give me your spoon,  I have an idea...
Hey you guys, You haven’t seen a woman named Goldilocks have you?
If you didn’t drink all our water, we could’ve easily dissolved this situation.
I don't think he's interested in us... he's got honey on the brain.
Don't squeeze me. I'm tiklish
I hear Smokey has been moonlighting on account of budget cuts.
Anybody have an epi-pen?
It looks like you have found yourselves in a sticky situation.
Careful, he's not as sweet as he looks!
I don't know , this could be a bear trap.
Just don’t call me honey.
Don't worry, it's me, Smoky. Smaller government is all about product placement.
Quick, let's get out of here. Those things get so sticky.
Can you please spare your Monkey Cap to protect my Dear Honey- heart from a huge swarm of hungry bees chasing me?"
The teddy bears are having their picnic.....
This one’s even worse: if he gets to you, you’ll be all sticky.
No, we haven't seen any Syrup Lady.
I wasn't expecting the bear of breakfasts past.
Hey, I'm looking for my Aunt Jemimah.
Pretend you're coffee!
If you run into Mr. Butterworth you tell him I know all about Ms. Jemima and that for all I care he can sweeten his own flapjacks from now on!
You take it, I'm carrying the peanut butter.
I don't think it can eat us, but diabetes is always a risk
Don't touch, he looks sticky.
Escape from GMO honey factory.
As soon as we find the butter we can open the pancake house.
Quick, get the insulin pen!
Just stay calm and back away slowly. I've heard this kind of bear is actually really sweet.
Honey Bear stalks the intruders.
Look, don't be scared. It's just a 'save the bees' PR thing.
The good news is we haven't started a forest fire.
Oh my, I forgot the pancakes!
What? You’re not the only ones dressing up for Halloween.
Have you seen the birthday boy? He got scared of me and ran off.
Maybe we should have paid attention to its expiration date.
Hide the beigneits.
Only you can prevent diabetes.
Oh no! A Russian honey pot sex trap to force us to vote Republican!
Quick, give me some tea.
Honey, this honey bear is definitely NOT sweet as Tupelo honey...
Uh-oh. That's the one you were squeezing hard at the IHOP.
The pairing may startle him, so hand me the pepper spray.
Check your calendar. Halloween was last week.
Let's get that thing off his head before he decides he needs a protein with it.
I knew we shouldn't of walked through the chamomiles.
So this is where you think the ants are heading?
And you can tell that other bear to kiss my sweet you-know-what.
Is he begging or is it a quid pro quo?
He's sweet and all, but he wants me to give him a squeeze.
I’ll be hibernating soon. If you could prepare some hot tea, I’ll sweeten it and we can share. Otherwise, I think I’ll eat you.
Do you think it's a honey trap?
Which of you can run the fastest?
Pooh Bear looked much nicer in the book
Offer it the Swedish Fish and back away slowly.
Don't be scared.  You're not my cup of tea
Smoky's out, cold. So anything done by a bear in these woods, I'M the bear that's doing it.
I think she is Smokey Bear’s wife.
Uh-oh. This is a sticky situation.
Never recycle a container that’s not completely empty.
Things are about to get very sticky, dear!
I think we can out run him cause it looks like he's been microwaved a  few times.
YOU TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN!
There's no way that's the organic variety
Should we call Mrs. Butterworth's?
What do you mean they said “honey comes from bees”?
Geez, he's gained weight since he broke up with  Mrs. Butterworth, the maple syrup gal
My way of giving back
I think she just wants a hug
Hillary's trying to show a sweeter side, but she still scares the hell outta me!
Quick honey, get out the pancakes!
Do you think he’s a sweet bear?
We should run — he’s probably stuck to the ground.
I think they've taken this "Make Our Parks Safe Again" theme a bit too far.
Oh no! I never remember--is it make ourselves bigger, make ourselves smaller or pull out an English muffin?
Of course I do that in the woods.  But I also collect honey in the woods.
Aunt Jemima can't be far behind!
I can't remember if your supposed to play dead or give them a biscuit?
Phil, when I said to bring the bare necessities, this is not what I meant.
Got Waffles?
Oh no, do something! The kids very specifically said they want maple syrup.
Big Foot and I are having a superfood party. Want to come?
Okay, back away slowly, eyes down, mouth wide open.
Is it still halloween?
Is this what you meant when you said this would be a "sweet hike"?
But remember this too...only YOU can prevent diabetes.
Huh. I thought that nickname was exclusive to us...
Don't be nervous - I'm really very sweet!
So this is what they mean by all natural.
Hey there, are you looking for a chuck-wagon? Follow me.
I think we need to clean the fridge.
Honey, do you know this man?
Beware! You are what you eat.
Watch out, those things are always sticky.
I told you we shouldn't have had pancakes.
How did he know we brought pancakes?
They say you are what you eat and this time I want opposable thumbs.
I don't know Dear.  He doesn't look like Pooh.
Psst, do you have any bagels and peanut butter?
..this brings into question the term “Loaded for Bear”...
The lost hikers met a sticky end.
Honey, I shrunk our perception of reality.
Have you by any chance come across my honey, a giant clover?
It’s why we never have a problem with flies here.
I don't care if he's promising medicare for all, just keep walking.
First Big Oil, now Big Honey?

Honey? I Don't think we're in Molasses anymore
Revenge is sweet!
Say, Mike... did you happen to pack the Earl Grey?
Honestly, it’s more than I can bear.
Why are you raiding us for honey?!"
That's what I get for becoming vegan.
Who did you call honey bear?
You distract him while I get a jar.
Are YOU organic?!
This situation could get sticky.
Uh oh. I think we are (French) toast.
Brrrr....Honey, this guy is hiking bare!
Is that whole evolution thing crystallizing for you now?
I am so confused!
I'd kill for a piece of salmon.
I don't know what you people see in nature-if I get any more ants in my honey hole, I'll scream!
I knew it was a bad idea to put honey in your coffee.
Not now, Harvey!
We'll just be on our way...we're more of an stevia family anyway.
Don't be scared.  I hear they're a bit sweeter than other bears found in these woods.
It's Smokey the bear's mean cousin Honey.
I have replaced Smokey.
Help!! I'm being pursued by a toasted English muffin!
We know the protocol for a black bear and for a grizzly...
Retreat slowly toward high ground—it’s as dangerous as white sugar.
I think GMOs have gone a bit overboard
I hope he doesn’t step in an aunt pile.
Definitely an approach avoidance situation.
We really got ourselves in a sticky situation
I only hope that's honey.
There's no bee in my bonnet.
There are other jobs besides putting out fires.
I'm not telling him we've seen Pooh!
Again, I don't really see why making 'grocery shopping an experience'  is a good thing
I'm leaning against unscrewing his lid for a taste.
"Don't panic, but hordes of carnivorous honey ants can't be far behind.
There must be pancakes nearby.
I can’t remember if we’re supposed to yell and jump around, or quietly make toast.
It's a bear, honey.
It's your money or your life, I mean honey.
Honey, bear with me through this
Walk away slowly; he's still shitting.
Well at least it's free range
I'M FULL OF BEE JIZZ.
I'm having an Eve moment.
It’s an epidemic Costco products come to life
You forgot to pack me!
Don't make any sudden ricotta toast.
I think we're all "organic" here.
Could he be the fabled king of the honey bears?
Bear with me and I'll explain in a minute.
Not another step. That’s the biggest honey trap I’ve ever seen.
I told you not to leave the waffles out..
Smile, and don't make any sarcastic remarks about him not being organic.
I hate it when condiments creep up on you!
Quick, get the bread out.
Just give it the toast.
Are you sure it’s organic?
I think we’re safe. He seems to be dispensing with other things.
He looks sweet, squeezable, and slightly sticky."
There must be better ways to market environmentalism.
Finding wholesale honey shouldn't be this hard.

Have you seen Mustard Macaw? We were supposed to be dressing.
Keep calm and pretend you're baklava.

Sure it looks sweet, but it's the most lethal type of bear - if you count cases of diabetes.
You didn't pack any tea, did you?
“Now remember, we’re in bee country.”
See, I told you honey wasn't vegan!
Don't worry, I'm pasteurized!
I hope befriending him doesn't turn out to be a honey boo-boo.
Reach in my pack for the apple slices.  Sloooowly.
I don't know if we should run or get the biscuits out of our packs.
You’d better not refer to me as Honey Bear anymore, until we’re back home.
I think that crack about lube last night was a mistake.
Bears hate pepper spray.  And I hate mixing sweet and savory.

Looks like someone had a rough night. Aunt Jemima hog all the wet wipes?

Beware of bees
None of your beeswax, buster!

you're in for a big surprise.
This free-range trend is getting a bit ridiculous
Honey, did you remember to pack the bear spray?
If you ask me, he looks even more out of it than that lady we saw this morning  wearing the apron and packing all that syrup.
What made you think you can fetch a pail of water! I am going to break your crown and throw you off the hill.
Nice.
If you don't stop calling me that, sweetie, this could get very sticky.

Honey, which way does the trail—

“I think you need to start calling me a different pet name.
I hate saccharine endings.
I think that bear got guac on his sombrero.
I think it's a decoy.
Did someone say "Honey Bear"?
Actually, in this case running away works just fine.
I told you to hide the toast.
Ditch the pancake mix.
It's okay, Brad. It's that harmless product placement hologram everyone's been spotting.
Hold very still -- I'll get the tea out of your pack.
I told you to stay in my pantry!
I just tell you the next part of the trail is rather sticky.
Brown hit the ground, clover tip it over.
By any chance, are you a Costco member?
That much honey could kill you.
You folks look like you have gotten yourselves into a sticky situation.
Have you seen a slice of toast?

Please tell me you didn't pack Mama's little cub.
Honey, you shrunk the adults.

There goes our Keto retreat!
I shouldn't have taken that selfie while squeezing its belly.
Once a convenience that was sweet and squeezable. Now it’s a big problem that won’t go away by itself.
Honey, I found the bear.
I think we’re lost but bear with me honey!
Tell him to tie his shoes- then lick!!
Honey, I blew up the bear.
I was wondering why we never saw her.  Now I know he keeps her in the kitchen cooking.
The bear-shaped honey container-shaped bear was not ready to let the world know about its existence,
I don’t know why bees get all the credit.
This is where things can get a little sticky.
Here in the forest, they call me “Sweetie.
Sigh, I can never find this on the shelf when I need it!
Quick, pass me a waffle.
I dunno, Bob, it doesn't look very sweet to me.
Get the waffle out of my backpack
That would be one very sticky bear hug
Missus Butterworth - I presume?
are you sure that making bzz noises, pretending to be beez will work?
Here's the plan: I drop the waffle, we run like hell.
You didn't forget to put the tea in the bear bag, did you hun?
I begged you not to pack those tea bags.
Hi there. Thanks for clicking on the "Sweet" App.
Honey, I think we have a problem"
I don't think he's happy that we put him in the blue recycling container.
I told you we shouldn't have brought the tea.
Be careful; it might be a Trojan horse.
Ready for breakfast.
This looks like a sticky situation.
Forget the bleeping honey give me cash
No one ever accused Smokey of being saccharine.
Have we had breakfast yet?
No, I'm sorry sir, all our granola bars contain flax seed.
Wow, these bears National Park bears really are getting domesticated.
Don't worry, you wont freeze when you hibernate
Try not to look like toast!
Shh. Stay quiet and he may just glaze us.
He knows we hugged the fabric softener.
Wow! Why is he in the jungle he should be advertising.
We'd better camp here and make some biscuits before he wanders off.
We seem to be in a sticky situation.
Pooh!
We must really be lost .. I thought this was Mrs. Buttersworth territory.
Quick... Hand me some bread!
I was hoping it was Mrs. Butterworth.
Quick act like your a cup of tea.
Be careful, it's high in glucose.
What, so now the bears feed the humans? Not sure I'm ready for that.
Last night when you screamed "Oh GOD! Yes, Honey Bear!"
You gave the almighty an idea.
Do you think he smells the cheese?
He's right. You never know.
First gummy bears now this!
Those weren't blueberries.
Really?
Watch out -- it could be some kind of Millenial tar baby!
I wonder if he knows Big Foot.
Stop arguing and give her your mustard.
Not to worry, this bear is looking for a biscuit.
That settles it, Fred, the factoid about honey coming from bees can now can be laid to rest.
I think the giant plastic bottle is reaching out for a squeeze. You go ahead, it could get sticky but I've got the tea.
Mother Nature decided to drop the grizzly persona and go for a sweeter image.

I'm available to help out if you forgot to bring honey for your tea.
Hey, baby -- wanna make some pancakes?
Awww... he looks so sweet.
He says, pretty please, save the bees.
And the turtles complain about straws?
While Smokey’s been working overtime in California, I‘ve been moonlighting at the diner
I know its eat or be eaten but this is unbearable!
Squeezing you into a jar will be the sweetest revenge.
Show it the NutraSweet in you pack.
He didn't close his nozzle.
I don’t care how sweet he is, find his stickiness unbearable.
No, this isn't granola...why do you ask?
Just one squeeze won’t kill you.
Are you lost too?
It's part of a campaign to overcome the whole 'bear in the woods is bad' thing...
Honey?" "Yeah,Dad?
Oh dear,I forgot the tea!
Your cub is the cupboard
Only y'all can prevent mispronunciations. 
This is the "Appa-LATCH-uh"  trail, not "Appa-LAY-shuh".
Quick, grab the pancakes!
Robotic... Part of Honey Hive Farms' new ad campaign.
I see you are the giant economy size.  We are just two.
I heard that  this trail was a real sweet hike
No, I don't think it's Smokey this time--
Quick! Throw him some graham crackers!
You fend it off. I’ll go get toast.
Quick - distract him with a piece of toast!
I think he just needs a paper towel for the nozzle.
I was going to forage for truffles, but I've changed my mind.
Just act natural and keep walking. This could get sticky.
I told you to stop singing that song by Father John Misty . . . Honey Bear Oh Honey Bear!!
Honey Bear, we don’t care.
Now that's a lot of honey ... honey!
I was expecting Smoky!
I know you’re hungry  but I heard theses particular trail bears can carry botulinum
Quick! Take the biscuits and run!
Oh, a present from the Trojans.
I didn’t know that bears did that in the woods, too!
I’m hoping he wants a cup of tea.
Please tell me you packed the toast and the peanut butter.
Wait!  I'm the Good Bear of the North.
OK. Slowly, now. Pass me the peanut butter.
I think we’ve walked into a sticky situation.
Don’t be alarmed. He looks sweet and harmless.
Don't get between him and his biscuits.
Do you think that honey tastes just right?
Honey, I have a feeling we're not in Pooh Corner anymore.
I'm Smokey the Bear's cousin Honey Bear. But don't worry, I'm Non-GMO...
I knew we shouldn't have hiked on Pancake Day weekend.
Another cut ?  Shouldn’t there be 3 bears ?
'Did you say "Come here, honey"?'
You had to figure there would be trouble when the bees went corporate!
Honey Bear gives a whole new meaning to the expression "A wolf in sheep's clothing."
I told you I smelled toast.
So, you call him your "Honey" too!
My apologies. You're my honey, too.
I think we should just give him the biscuits.
Quick, hide the bread!
You said we wouldn’t get in a sticky situation
This Winnie the Pooh remake sucks.
A little late to try to expose the real whistleblower. I'm already busted.
Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
Get out the spray.
Honey, we’re home!
Seen a bear looking like a pancake?
The honey crystallizes when they hibernate. It makes them grumpy.
Watch out, its sticky.
My real name is "Honey Trap,"  but you can call me "Smokey."
Excuse me hikers, do you have any agave syrup to spare?
Would you like to see my Honey-Moon?
YOU tell him we drank the milk.
As I was saying, there's a scientific explanation for everyth--- AAAH! A giant honeybear!!
Why does she keep calling me “Honey”?
Is one of you named Pooh?
Fake Bear Honey!!!
Remember, you never want to come between a mother and her crumpets.
The bees outsource too.
Should we play dead or sweeten our tea, dear?
Look, honey bear!
Be honest Phillip, did you call an Uber? You are the absolute worst hiker and speller.
Just cooking a delicious vegan meal
Honey, this is why I didn't want to go on this retreat
Relax, it's just a giant bottle of honey!
Hi guys."
Oh, poo!
Trust me, Honey, I've got your back.
I can’t find the cap. Can I use one of yours?
I think some marketing departments might be going a bit too far. Not to mention human resources.
If you move slow, he'll move slow
You said we have to travel light, I left the tub of butter at home.
They decided Smokey was not a good role model.
Feel free to call me Smokey or Pooh too.
It's OK. He came to me asking help and advice.
Who's that squirt following us?
Let's slowly walk away or we'll end up all sticky.
It can't be him. He carries his honey ON his head not IN it.
Oh, there he is . . . grab the bread and peanut butter, quickly.
Wasn't the Sta Puft Marshmallow Man at our campfire enough?!
Should we play dead or just tell him we’re pre-diabetic?
You can see why I said getting out of my previous relationship was a sticky situation!
Slowly, reach into your pack and hand me the jam...
He must be organic.
Did you bring the tea?
Should - should I squeeze him?
If give him the freeze-dried waffles, we may be able to avoid a sticky situation.
That’s a weird Halloween costume
I knew we should have hung the oatmeal.
Sorry, he was talking to *me* ...
I’m more of an agave perso
I am just giving you honey!
Hello, I'm the official Ambassador for Honey, and I need to check your backpacks to see if you're carrying any out of the campsite.
I'm afraid he only looks sweet...
I think someone is following us, Honey.
Is this an ominous political sign or an answer to the bear in the woods riddle?
Maybe packing tea wasn't such a good idea after all.
He's not sweet, in actuality he's very dangerous.
Yes Burt, he can run downhill!!
Just give me your food and no one has to get sticky hands.
If Pooh sees this, we will have the first bear cannibalism issue.
The guidebook didn’t say whether we could squeeze the honey bears or not.
Got any toast?
Honey, I think we're in a sticky situation.
Saw a sweet bear. Thought it seemed his intentions were a bit sticky.
I'd say he's more 'raw' than 'local'
Me too?
I tell you, plastic waste is everywhere.
Oh...that whole time I thought you were calling me honey bear.
The bear thought I called him honey, but I was talking to my husband
Honey bear, what the heck is that thing?
I guess we're in a sticky situation.  Don't let her to get her bear hands on me.
Where's Goldielocks when you need her?
Before we run, could you check if it’s on sale?
We're gonna need a bigger tea.
Back away slowly, and try not to act like a mug of herbal tea.
Do you still have those tea bags?
Are you the ones that Googled for a honey bear?
I think we're supposed to pretend we're bread.
It's been a long time since I've seen humans of the right size. Now just stay put...
The Honey Bear is a close cousin to the imfamous Gummi, and while playing dead might save you from a Gummi attack, it will put you in a sticky situation when a Honey attacks.
This experience is going to stick.
Should we play diabetic?
Now that's a squeeze back!
Despite Aunt Jemima's case being dismissed, Honey Bear asked everyone he met if they knew a good plaintiff corporate lawyer.
Don’t worry, Honey. He looks sweet.
Hey honey bear, what’s that?
You are what you eat.  Nothing to be afraid of.
They did say that this trail was short and sweet.
This is about to be a sticky situation.
We're  visiting Goldilocks and the three bears, but we've lost our way.  You seem to be heading in that direction.
When will there be an end to corporate takeovers?
I think it wants us to squeeze it !
Give me a squeeze, Honey
Keep walking, your diabetic.
You know what they say Winnie, you are what you eat.
You should've checked the cupboard for a fourth bear before we ate that tasteless porridge.
We should have told him his honey was just right.
Delicious. Now I just have to find the toast.
Unnerved at first, the group later realized the long-term benefits of substituting Les Honey for Maxx Sugar.
This is why I told you not to pack English muffins for this trip.
Careful, this could be a sticky situation.
And you said hiking on Halloween would be fun?
UM... YOU DON'T LOOK A HONEY TO ME
Ummm, would you mind turning around?  Yes, we do this in the woods, and you are what you eat!
Do you have any organic, locally sourced tea to share with him?
Don't squeeze the bear"
We're going to need Smokey Bear to help us open Honey Bear.
Don't bother checking for your wallet, I don't think that's the kind of 'bread' he's asking for ...
Feels like I should start calling you Pookie...
Remember what the park ranger said— they’re not as sweet as they look!”
Just give him the peanut butter sandwiches and run for it.
Should we invite him to join us for breakfast?
Try squeezing me and you might get more!
Where's my toast?
In case of attack, lie down and pretend to be a sopapilla.
Quick, honey. Toss her the bottle, or this could become a sticky situation...
We've got a sticky situation here, Mark!
Sorry. I thought you were calling me honey bear.
...I understand they are rebranding Smokey...
I don’t think we should try squeezing him.
Quick, make a very large bowl of oatmeal!
Okay you win. I'll leave the dandelions in the yard.
Caution free-range companies
They don't look this sweet in the pictures.
Don't fall for it. Aspartame is much safer.
Your bear hug idea would only make the situation stickier.
It’s tempting, but let’s just stick with Costco.
Looks like we're the oatmeal.
It’s naturally sweet, organic and gluten-free
It  must be  the smell of  our  backpacks that the
bear is attracted to!
It says HONEY, 
not
HORNEY!


Jerry Berman
Darling, didn't you say I'm sweeter than honey and great at running?
Goldilocks?  But you said I was just right..
Just give me your buns and you can be on your way..
Just play dead with your mouth open.
I know it says 'all natural,' but she's still ruining the mood.
It has no mouth. Keep your Sharpie out of sight and we'll survive.
This is proving agave is sweeter.
Didn't you get the memo ?
Back packs are a must not an option.
I agree, Walt. This forest might well have a bee problem.
This is why I asked for a GMO free weekend
I ALSO HAVE A HAAAAAAAAAT
He says he replaced Smokey.
Wait! You booked the cabin with sweet-surprise-brunch-included option.
Oh, it’s Smoky working his part time job
Don’t move.  And no more botulism talk.
He’s not as fearsome as high-fructose corn syrup.
The lions and tigers are on the way.
Excuse me,,do you have any peanut butter?
I thought they eradicated all the items from campsites that got hit with that radiation wave.
Do you think she’s feeling territorial because of our stevia-sweetened power bars?
Honey, don’t look now, but remember how I cleaned out the cupboard when we moved? ...
My superpower is smothering pancakes with sticky sweetness.
Don't worry, we will help you find Mrs. Butterworth.
I think he smelled tea on our breath.
Can you help me? I was supposed to be the IHOP twenty minutes ago.
Your portfolio may be doing great, but the bears are still out of work and hungry.
Either bears celebrate Halloween or this just got weird. Not that bears dressing for Halloween isn’t also weird.
Winnie the Pooh has gone commercial.
Well, it certainly doesn't look organic...
Watch out! Tony the Tiger may not be far behind.
She looks mean on the outside, but she's really sweet inside.
I think he wants biscuits.
Don’t worry, I think he’s domesticated
You can hug me. Just not too hard. I get light headed.
No worries, everyone knows she's 100%  U.S. Grade A Pure.
Don't worry, it's off-brand!
No. I've never even heard of a stickier situation than this.
Reach into my bag slowly and get the bear repellent. Or the teabags.
“Aw...let's invite him to hibernate in our kitchen.”
I have a brother who stays standing on his head!
And here we have a predatory condiment.
What the heck, wheres the organic certification?
You catch more bears with honey than vinegar.
No thanks, we just ate.
Climate change is indeed alarming.
This was the most harmless aparition you could think of, George?"

"Mr. Stay Puft was already haunting Manhattan.
These millennial bears constantly have to be told how sweet they are...
Smokey-the-Bear,  I think not.
Honey?  I think he stole the kids.
He looks scary, but he's really sweet.
Very carefully, hand me the graham crackers and tea...
Yeah, I know but it’s decent money.
Honey right behind you...”
Do you have any toast?
I don’t think we are in a grocery store any more.
No thanks, we're addicted to high fructose corn syrup.
Get the toast ready -- I'm going to give him a hug.
If we give him our pancake mix now, he may go away.
Don't be scared...you know me...I'm sweet!
Do you think it's native to these woods?
Oh, don't worry.  I'm not your average bear!
I've come for your graham crackers!
Hey peoples, do you have any toilet paper I could borrow?
I TOLD you not to get the wild sourced honey bears!
He looks sweet but you can never tell with wild animals.
I really find the taste of flannel and wool too bland too bland  without it.
This could turn into a sticky situation.
Shhh! Verrrry sloowly, hand me the  corn bread and butter.
She looks sweet, but I’d give her organic clover cub back if I were you.
Looking for a new squeeze?
Quick, give me a biscuit!
I feel bad about the bees.
This might be a sticky situation.
Would you like to join us for tea?
I can’t believe that’s all you think we do in the woods
Call it what you like, it's a trap!
I think that the lack of food is getting to us.
This must be the sticky situation your guidebook was talking about.
Quick! Find some warm water, or he's going to blow his top!
Don't worry, it's just a costume.
Have you seen Yogi & Smokey ?
Be calm... I read that it's not actually bear.
While I was hibernating, did you see any clowns pass by?
Quick, give him those waffles you packed before he stops smiling at us an has a mood change.
What happened to Smokey the Bear?
I told you those mushrooms were magic. Introducing local honey.
You squeeze from the back and I'll squeeze from the front...
Halloween was last week, and you are attracting flies!
Didn't I ask you NOT to pack the Gummy Bears?
Can't you just use the small packets like everyone else does?
Did someone say product endorsement?
I want a quid pro quo- honey for salmon.
Calm down, I may be raw and unfiltered, but I'm gluten free.
Excuse me, have you seen a short friendly  bear with a red shirt?
Look what you’ve gone and done.  Now do you understand how irascible it is when you keep saying, “Honey, does a bear shit in the woods”?
I'm the original Honey BOO!
No, we’ve never accused you of shitting in the woods!
Looks like his memory's been refreshed.
No, I said "Honey, where..."
Let's hope he's just looking for a refill.
Quick! Hide the graham crackers.
It seems the park ranger wasn't getting carried away with a bad joke after all.
So that's what happened to all the bees!
Give me all your yogurt, nuts, and cheese....and you won't get hurt.
Why don't you just go and gentrify somewhere else?
We're unionized now. I'd lose my benefits if I attacked.
Bugger off, this is my corner.
Don't run, we have to give him a bear hug to make him sweet.
Interesting.  I don't think I packed any.
It is the attack of the Honey Bear.
I told you he gets runny in the microwave!
Prétend you’re a cup of tea.
Who do you think we are, Hansel & Gretel?
Be not afraid.  I come in peace to sweeten your gorp.
I'm a little honey pot, short and stout.
Tip me over and pour me out.
Keep moving or we'll be toast!
You gotta help me get out of here! I’m being chased by a wild pooh bear.
Come on, Ben. Halloween was weeks ago.
Looks like we're not the only ones off the reservation.
Welcome to the Hundred Acre Wood!
She doesn't seem to be as sweet as the last one.
What do you give someone who has everything?
I think it's Smokey in drag but I still wouldn't trust him.  See how he's hiding his claws?
In these dire times, even the notoriously sweet Honey Bear has tuned sour.
Honey?"
"Yes?"
"Honey!
'Well they did say we'd be sure of a big surprise'
Believer me, she's not as sweet as she looks.
Stay very still and maybe he'll leave. Or invite us to tea.
Don't be scared, he's actually sweet on the inside
He's way too big for a honeybear.
I ain't as sweet as they say I am.
Quick! Pass me that giant biscuit we've been saving...
Now I ask you--could this sweet-smelling, roly-poly, plastic-coated squeezable bruin molest you?
Oops, I think we wandered into the Bear Witch Project.
Play dead, sweetie.
No, we do not raise bees
We'd better get out of here.  I see Bear Pooh in the woods!
Sorry, but I had to go. Don’t worry it smells so sweet!
I hear granola goes well with honey.  Let’s not find out!
Be careful. He thinks you have a giant biscuit on your back.
Call me "Honey" and I'll rip your throat out!
Missing breakfast has made them even more excited to have her  for lunch.
I promise to stop calling you Honey Bear if we get out of this one.
I would like to be your main squeeze, not Ralph over there.
So, Winnie-the-Pooh was a lie?
Aw, honey, look!
Excuse me.  Did you see a buttered biscuit pass this way?
The bees fired me for taking too much of the profits.
Smokey self-immolated. Can I help you?
So you call her 'Honeybear' too, Jack? Is there something you want to confess?
Hey Goldie, the deal didn't include the baby!
So much for 'natural sweetener'
Oh boy. It thinks we’re pancakes.
Quick,release the Honey Badger!
Don't panic.  Remember, the ranger said they're really sweet.
Who's cute now, sticky-whiskers?
Honest. Reparative therapy really works. I’m total vegan now.
When I said 'Honey we should go.' I wasn't talking to you.
Well, the good news is he seems to prefer sweet over savory.
Everything tastes better with honey.  Especially people!
Quick, the bear spray and some Sleepytime.
You look awfully sweet!
... makes me seem sweeter...
Have you seen the Tin Woodman? He asked me to lubricate his joints.
Jesus, it's the dreaded honey bear! You brought toast in your backpack, didn't you!!??
Try to not look like a biscuit!
Run...Fructose!
He's sweet, but I miss that Smokey guy.
Would either of you kind humans happen to have some bread and peanut butter to share?
Well, if this isn’t a sticky situation, then I don’t know what is.
Should we give him a quick squeeze and then bolt?
She's just pissed her hat is always sticky...
Watch out. This could develop into a very sticky situation.
Don't squeeze the animals.
You distract him. I'll grab the chamomile.
I told you not to have tea outside the tent!
Wow, guess we put the squeeze on him a bit too much?
Remember -- Open borders. Medicare for All. Gay Rights. Me Too. Safe Spaces. Black Lives Matter. Impeachment. Impeachment. Impeachment!
To whom is your call 'honey 'directed?
I can bearly see honey here.
Sometimes you eat the bear, well.. and sometimes the bear eats you.
You don't want to get between a mama and her pancakes.
Local meat is better for my allergies.
No, if you want honey that bad then you squeeze it...
I’m the new spokesperson.
Smoky was too macho.
Uhhh, honey . . .
I told you we shouldn't have splurged on those honey cakes last night!
Don't fall for it.  I've heard about this joker before.
Don’t worry, he’s only scouring for biscuits
Quick, throw him some of your Swedish Fish!
So now you know, not all bears sh-t in the woods.
No, we haven't seen your delicious kids.
He must have seen you smush that bee.
I’m a little lost.  I belong near the maple syrups.
I told you not to steal those baby honey packets from the dumpster!
So...you find yourselves in a tight squeeze.  Just so happens, that's precisely what I need.
Sorry if I startled  you , do you have any tea to go with my honey?
No, I mean't honey bear—not honey, bear!
I see your name tag--you have the most common name in your neighborhood.
We must have wandered into the Honeywood Hills.
Should we tell him we are the type vegans who don't even eat honey?
Honey, can I get a squeeze?
Honey, I sure hope that bear doesn't devour us!
Honey beer, honey. Winnie, take a hike!
Did someone mention pancakes ?
If only I brought my tea bag.
Quick. Hand me the matzoh.
I'm the original superglue. Are you the original Hansel & Gretel?
You don’t have to be afraid, it’s organic.
I used to do another thing in the woods, but it was so disgusting  I decided to gather honey instead.
Anyone have any waffles?
Whatta you say we all get a little sticky?
Surprised?  Well, of course there's Smokey, I'm Honey, and there's another one of us you'll meet as well.
Uh-oh, sticky situation! Are we toast?
Costco escapee
Ex-squeeze me, folks.
I told you not to leave the ricotta and crostini out last night.
You think I’m big, wait until you see the size of the Pooh
Got honey?
They said these were extinct!
Should we run or get our leftover bisquits out?
As I said - Becoming an animal tracker will completely change the way you see the world.
Be careful. He’s looking for a sweet tooth.
I dare you to stick around
Keep an eye out for a swarm of bees.
Aunt Jemimah’s released the bears. The Hunger Games have truly begun, then. Funny because hunger in the book and movie franchise refers to famine but in this case can also mean aaaaaaaaaah fuck my fucking legs are being ripped off by a fucking bear
But it's the healthy kind of sugar.
Whatever you do, don’t act like a complementary food.
Do you have anything to treat bee stings?
Don't worry, he can't catch us.  He doesn't have legs.
You were right to bring maple syrup.
No, he doesn't look too sweet to attack.
Psst, you like the pure stuff?
Okay, we’ll find you another pet name.
The Beatles said: "Honey. Don't" and now two of them are dead. Don't make the same mistake.
He probably just wants our tea cups.
Should we tell him that BEES are the ones that make honey, not bears?
Smoky is gone, if not vegan, I'm at least vegetarian...
We're safe - we don't look like pancakes !
My Halloween outfit was so popular, I no longer have to run and hide from hunters and get great snacks from hikers.
I think it can't be a grisly bear
Oh no! It's the ... Mythical Bear of Product Placement*! 
(*Brought to you by The Condiment Council.)
Yeah, you SHOULD be scared. If I had legs you'd already be so sticky you'd be bothered until you got to a sink.
Have you gone off your paleo diet, Brad?
Only YOU can prevent forest littering.
Seems you can't escape non-degradable plastic, not even in the forest....
He can't see you if you don't move.
I thought I smelled Patagonia.
Lions and Tigers and GMO Bears, Oh My!
I know Halloween was last week but it lulls the tourists into a very sweet complacency.
Yes, I'm real!
Just be glad the real pooh bear isn't here.
Yikes, he didn't age well...you are what you eat I guess.
Careful.  There are bees EVERYWHERE.
Please don’t make fun dear, Smoky had to do something after his fire prevention gig ended.
Did you pack any teabags?
hail humans, I come in peace.
I can offer you diabetes or a vicious mauling"
Winnie the Pooh is stalking her.
I guess it's better than giant bees?
Halloween is not only for humans you know!
I thought Honey Bears were supposed to be sweet
He’s not as sweet as he seems.
Hey Bob, can you figure out who is going to eat who?
I've got a bone to pick with the Pillsbury Dough Boy.
or
Goldilocks is not as sexy as she thinks she is.
or 
Ah, human sushi. 
or 
I'm just waiting on Ginger and Wasabe to show up, so we can have human sushi
Harry, I told you those mushrooms you found were not the chanterelles that you usually use in your trail lasagna.
We need to make the best of a sticky situation.
Oh sure, he seems sweet, but don’t break out the granola”...
Back away slowly and get out the baked brie.
Careful, he's an Ezy-Squeeze bear
Smokey the Bear lost the naming rights.
Wait ‘til our listeners hear this! Our podcast is on fire!
Be wary of mimicry, humans. It's wasp country in these parts.
Sometimes you eat what's inside the bear, and sometimes the bear eats all of you.
Eat one of your Keto bars, this is going to take time..
He looks angry Carl....  No more Winnie the Poo jokes please...
I'm not sure if I should be afraid or not.
Do you think that's your husband?
Care to join me for waffles?
Honey, I'm beary scared right now.
Don’t get between her and her sugar cub!
He looks sweet, but he is dangerous
Should we clean the poor dear's cap?
Well, at least we'll have an endless supply of honey in case he follows us home.
Get moving! He's about to squirt his spout!
I think he said he’s lost his wagon.
Goldilocks! It's so nice of  you to bring your husband and baby to the Teddy Bear's Picnic
Honey, I think you should have worn the Smokey outfit instead.
Rebecca Hawkins
Okay, this is either a dream or an advertisement.
I’m afraid I lost my way from the diner!
Uh-Uh... You butt-clicked the H-uber app again.
These woods aren't even close to 100 acres... and how dare you say I look like poo.
Be careful. They look sweet, but they'll tear your diet apart.
Oh great, first Mrs. Butterworth sneezes on us, and now this?
Love honey if you can bear it!
I got lost going to the church pancake breakfast, can you tell me the way to town?
Quick! Break out those dry granola bars.
Having women work with men is like having a grizzly bear work with salmon dipped in honey
I'm sorry, were looking for Winnie the Pooh.
He's demanding either pancakes or waffles !!!
Uh Oh! Things are about to get sticky!
Careful Honey!  I doubt its BPA-free.
Look- He knows what he wants and he's going for it.
Be careful! From the looks of things, she's been feeding her young.
Don’t make eye contact with him, Elizabeth, he might have corn syrup!
He’s probably harmless because they’re raw, wild and natural.
This is going to sound crazy, but I think we should eat him.
Don’t be scared,  as I am actually a very Sweet Bear.
I think I’ll pass. The risk far outweighs the reward.
Quick!  Quietly hand me the bread, then do something to make it look down..."
Uh-oh! We should run before this gets any stickier.
Have you seen that cannibalistic SOB Winnie?
I was just trying to introduce myself. You didn’t hear the second “Boo?”
Let’s run for it.  I thought they were extinct..
It was either this or bear stew.
Among the other more immediate problems, "Honey Bear" was just eliminated as a pet name.
I'm the first Test-Jar Pooh-B.
If we were flies, I'd be worried...
Vegan karma
My Heart Minds only Honey!
Whoa. This augmented reality thing is too much.
I may appear mean outside, but I'm full of honey inside!
Can you tell us how to get to Aunt Jemima's house?
Oh my God, Jeff it's a angry, yet delicious beeear!
You can’t stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes.
Where do you think he got that costume?”
“Probably Etsy
Branded bears?!  What would Gerald Durrell do?
Well isn't this a sticky situation.
Excuse me. May I borrow a cup of honey?
I thought you were kidding about hanging our pancakes in the bear bag.
Who are you calling sweet?
Don’t
Gonna be a real lack of pollination this year.
What's that bear doing in the woods?
We’ll stick around if we squeeze together.
Wouldn't it BEE sweet if we were friends?
In reality, Smokey had diabetes.
Don't worry Honey
I'm sure another bear would come by to eat him.
You save yourself, I'll make tea.
Give me another bite of that energy bar.
Only you can prevent bland sopapillas.
I told you not to call me "Honey" out here.
Be careful, she might be a honeypot.
Sorry, but I'm allergic to nuts.
Quick play dead! Or is that for syrup bears?
When you’ve put everything in the bear box except the herbal tea.
Only YOU can prevent biscuit dryness!
I told you that your bad eating habits would come back to haunt you
I don't issue warnings like Smokey.
Reach into my pack slowly and remove the soppapillas
I think we are going to be in a sticky predicament.
Quick, throw your tea on the ground to distract him.”
He’s been following me everywhere since I stopped eating sugar.
It was then, I blew my top!
You tell Winnie, he's dead to me.
I believe this is where honey comes from.

‎”It’s tremendously transparent, I don't see why it would be a Russian honey bear.”
No waffling.
So should we make ourselves look like a big pancake?
I don't like him following us, but he sure tastes great on the peanut butter sandwiches!
I know we should run, but, frankly, he looks quite harmless.
Hey, I'm not born-with-a 'Bloody' Horn. Dunno what caused a bleeding once I tried to force open the stuck Honey Jar!
I think we should stick to ‘babe’ from now on
We have to cope, it’s paying for the upkeep.
Don't worry,she's really quite sweet.
Well...YOU’RE the one who insisted on tea in our thermoses.”
Of course he does—why would you ask him that?
I don’t think the spout helps.
I told you that sticky stuff you stepped in was honey bear droppings.
You see any bee hives in your travels?
I preferred Smokey when he was less sweet
Well now, this is a sticky situation.
Just be thankful it's not Mrs Butterworth again
Oh, dude you’re confusing sweet with nice. You’re actually a jerk!
It's glazin' time.
Don't get between her and her pancakes
Trust me, I have gotten you out of sticky situations before.
You're gonna need a bigger toast.
Objects of endearment enjoyed in the raw.
Babe these mushrooms aren’t worki- (gulp).
Don't worry. It takes a lot for these things to go bad.
Bear spray would be a recipe for disaster.
He doesn't look sweet to me.
That's nice, just slinking out without saying goodbye...
It's a cute ruse.  He's alive and he's out to steal our honey.
You seem to be a nice, toasty couple.
With all that glucose, it must be hypernating.
Have you seen my comb?
So, As I was saying...
I think the wizard is drunk again.
I'll hive what she's hiving!
I should not have worn my pancake makeup today.
I vote we ditch that camping toaster thing from REI pronto.
Quick, do that really good pancake impression while I run away.
I have no teeth to bare, but I am squeezable.
Look, I just know that he makes sticky in the  woods.
I think I left the bear spray in the garage next to the backcountry tea.
Do you see what I see? Yes Honey!
Honey, I can explain. She's just a friend.
I hope you brought insulin.
Your keto diet can't save you in the wild.
Scratch the woods as a retreat from that 'bottled - up' feeling.
No need to be nervous dear, he’s really sweet and dripping with affection.
Don't make any sudden movements until the toast pops.
ONLY YOU...can prevent the mass extinction of bees.
The archetype exists!
Not quite what I meant when I said, ‘Let’s get bare, Honey.’
Maybe we should have just left those extra sopaipillas on the table at Casa Bonita?
We should've packed the agave instead.
SO YOU REALLY DID MOVE ON UP TO THE EASTSIDE..?
sweet dreams, y'all
Don't move. I think it just wants a toast rabbit.
Surprise! Now you know a bear can do the opposite in the woods.
I picked the worst year to go vegan.
Uh-oh, if he's hungry, we're in a sticky situation.
You’re on my Honey Do list.
We're going to need a bigger recycle bin.
I don't think he's dangerous. He just wants some tea.
Relax. It's just testing its dominance of the honey market.
I think you were right about that last patch I found mushrooms.
Quick, grab the hot buttered toast!
That’s a boo boo when honey bear tags along.
Maybe it just wants our pancake mix.
You're not wearing your waffles are you?
Yeah, yeah, didn’t think you’d get scared either, huh?
Did I hear someone say, “Honey Bear?”
Bear with me, Harold... I think he's sweet on me.
Help
Hmm, Dad that bear seems a bit eager to join us for tea. Whatcha think?
Please eat me, before I eat myself.
Ok, Honey, what’s next? Aunt Jemima or El Paso?
Forget  singing happy birthday .
Run like hell!
I'll give you directions for a little 'you-know-what.'
You haven’t by any chance seen the mustard?
Quick, leggo your Eggo!
Have you seen Greg's bag of mushrooms?
Mrs. Butterworth is just ahead.
Oh you found her huh? And here I thought another Prince Charming calling out to me.
Take out your gun - he will make a fine bong over the fireplace.
Everyone has a mask.
I guess this is where Costco gets their all natural honey bears!
well, this is bearfect!
Looks like he slathers.
Is it vegetarian?"
"Emm...I don't think so, honey.
I told you we'd get into a sticky situation if we strayed off the path!
You distract him and I'll squeeze around the middle until he's empty.
I'll protect us - you need to watch your blood sugar level.
The B movie but the honey is defending itself instead
Honestly, does it really matter whether or not he's organic ?!
I think it's time for a toast.
He looks hungry...and sugar-crazed.
Honey cures wounds.
Don't judge me. I'm just trying to be myself.
Stand back, or I will beat you with my bear hands.
Bear with Me... I’ve got a sweet tooth!
Jim, I can’t believe you got us into another sticky situation!
I feel that we’re about to get into a sticky situation.
Grrr! My plastic is non-biodegradable!
They love it when you call ‘em Big Papa.
Sorry to interrupt... but my cousin Yogi says it  is time to evacuate!
Sticky situations seem to follow us.
Relax, It's  All Nayural and Organic!
Who knew we would need bear spray around here?
Okay, now…very carefully…slide two pieces of toast from your backpack.
Wow they take their honey-moons quite literally here.
The guide books didn't prepare me for this.
Did we bring the right kind of toilet paper?
His hugs can get sticky.
Typical. A high value target and me without my assault weapon.
Oh Dear!! Sticky situation!!
No break from the advertisement
Not you"
Isn't this past your bedtime?
Do you like this one or the Big Foot one
Give him the peanut butter or he’ll blow his top.”
I'm sweet on you two. How about a threesome?
Don't do it, Helen! It's a Trojan horse.
What did I tell you about the diabetes bracelet?
What? You don't think I'm a real bear, Karen.
You kids wanna buy some sweets?
Whatever you do. Don't Squeeze him!
It's either lost or he still thinks it's Halloween.
quick - give him all the teabags we've got!
Happy Halloween!  Trick or Trick!
This wild bear attack is sponsored by the Honey Growers of America, Inc.
Surprise!! I followed you to the woods today,
Got Milk?
You’d both go very well with some honey.
Only you can prevent the bees from reclaiming their honey.
I heard the state parks had made some budget cuts but...
Cyborg Pooh was just happy to be alive
and meeting new people always
made it a special kind of day.
I think it's angry, Honey
Should we flee or sugar coat him?
Tis better to give than receive.
'Uh oh...he's going to erupt!"
I think we should run and not waffle about it!
They' go to extremes to get tourists to feed them.
If this isn't sexual harassment, I don't know what is.
So is he turned on by me, or is it you?
Should we punch it in the nose?" "I don't know, he looks kinda sweet"
Mothers who have already self actualized are pretty safe.
It's Poohnocchio.
Now I squeeze your honey.
I think we're in for a big surprise.
If he attacks, just play sticky.
Don't panic, I know what to do. Hand me your frappuccino.
Give him your beef jerky, he has enough carbs.
Help me take this suit off?"
Give me all your honey, honey!
Its worse than that ! Its a rare Honey Glaze Marinading Bear!"
ARE YOU SMOKING WEED?
Wow. What a coincidence. You did remember to pack the biscuits didn't you?
Is a bear sweet in the woods?
Actually, I’m Honeybear’s monster
give me the zucc
She may look mean, but she's all sweet inside.
It's real. We're not in a desert.
It's a real bear getting honey in this forest.
I told you he would attract ants!
I’m not sure what to make of it. Maybe he just finished reading ‘The Secret’?
Where was this guy when we had our tea earlier?
Told you I wasn't lying.
It seems safer than Warren’s Medicare for all, but sweeter than Buttigieg’s
Now I've seen everything.
I think wesid%22:3%2C%22surl%22:%22https://www.newyorker.com/%22%2C%22sref%22:%22https://www.google.com/%22%2C%22sts%22:1573305770375%2C%22slts%22:15584225569
Don’t trust him. Looks like a typical honeypot trick to me”.
Don't panic. He's sweet. I just hope the mustard isn't around.
Keep still. If you startle these guys, they'll spray.
Don’t worry honey, he looks rather sweet.
What did Goldie Lox do this time?
I can soften him up. Pass me the camping microwave.
Whao. You scared me.  I thought you were Smokey.
How about some waffles?
I thought privatizing was supposed to make our parks more customer friendly!
And I thought Halloween was over!
What are you supposed to do when you see a honey bear again?
Sorry! Just sold out except a few drops for free Licks."
Shh, I think I hear...some ultra-filtered honey?
I didn't mean this Bear Grylls
Do you like my Halloween costume?
I hope he's sweet.
I think we need to get out the mace.
Honey, it's the HONEY BEAR!!!!!!
I told you not to sweeten your tea!
Uh, Honey? There's a strange man watching us.
Did you just say, "Oh poo?"  I rather like that name better.
How gauche, he ate the honeycomb too.
I am the honeypot. I have been put out.But the bees haven't come around. Because they're dead.
Where have all the hives gone?
Oh look!  It's the crazy nasty*** honey bear. "Honey bear doesn't care."
I  just wanted to get a taste, but he squirted at me.
I heard you can scare off honey bears if you just yell "BEES!"
Challa
How much did he say it was? Bearly  getting by.
It no longer looks sweet.
I told you not to bring the green tea - now what?
Sorry to startle you, but can you spare your granola?
Kid stuff. It's not raw, wild honey.
Don’t open your fly yet.
Never call your wife "honey" in a place that can have bears. Actually only call if you don't like her very much.
If  that's Baby Bear's honey dispenser I'd prefer to avoid the parents.
Please tell me you packed your wallet.
No honey,it's okay. He's a sweet bear.
If she answers to “Tansy Ragwort”, run!
I wonder if he knows where the Milk is.
So that small bottle at the campsite wasn't yours?
I don't think squeezing is the way to go.
I told you he wasn't hibernating! Honey on my morning biscuit wasn't worth it.
Bears really do drip in the woods!
Otto, how good is your bumblebee impression?
Rocky Mountain we’re high.
Honey-Bear got your tongue?
Whatever you do, don’t make any sudden attempt to use your squeezable bear honey container.
It's almost as bad as sugar!
So, I'm thinking we shouldn't have grabbed
those sweet little "samples" at breakfast.
Christopher Robin, this bear isn't silly nor old!
Beware the Bear in Honey Bear clothing!
Do you think he is Smokey the Bear, Yogi Bear, or...
Winnie the Pooh?
Sweetie, you use that to salt the rim of a margarita glass.
I need to feel useful - Don’t suppose you packed a ham?
Yes,he's a bear,but he looks sweet enough.
Should we play dead, or boil water for tea?
Honey, Can you spare a rhyme.
What can I say to him to keep him from following us?
I know it’s for Macy’s, but who squeezed that drip?
A “honey” bear? She doesn’t look sweet to me!
Honey, I blew up the honey!
I got here first.
Appreciate you not swatting at the Bees
Frank Buckley
Andover, MA
Remember we read in the hiking guide that these Oregon bears were using CBD?
This is where I drop off.
Looks like putting him in the microwave didn't soften him up any.
Isn't this the guy that was beat out by Sugar Bear? Yeah...I thought he was dead
Honey, is that a bear.
John, is this where we stop for tea?
I think he's looking for some pancakes.
'" know it looks harmless but it's still sugar."
Sorry, we’re vegan.
You are in denial. It's like when you said with Tinker Bell  I do believe in fairies. Run!
Don't worry, they usually get pretty stiff when it's half empty.
I don’t think so
The ad copy reads: Only You Can Prevent Hive Colony Collapse Disorder
Unfortunately, Earl Grey and Chamomile weren't hot enough to dissolve the sticky situation.
Commercialization has gone too far.
Honey, I'm afraid we might be lost.
Finally, you are a grown-up now!
Honey: that's a big bear.
As I said, honey isn't vegan.
I was looking for a different Honey Pot so I could go pee.
Hide the anaimal crackers
give me your ham >:0
Don't be fooled by the t-shirt and cute cap.
Smokey got overwhelmed and quit - I'm all you have left.
Careful, could be a Joker spin-off.
Wait, I thought we locked the house?
you said they were sweet!
Do you think he smells the pancakes, granola, and tea in our backpacks?
Just don’t get between her and her crackers.
Oh, no! We said banding not branding.
Any bagels in those backpacks of yours?
I think the microdosing has finally caught up.
I wonder if she den's up with Smokey ?
Hey If you're not here to pollinate you need to get out!
This could get a little sticky.  Did you bring any handiwipes?
I don't know whether to play dead or squeeze him onto my granola bar.
Well, it looks like you've gotten yourselves in a sticky situation.
I'm your Honey Bear Nightbear.
I melt in the microwave. But, you don’t have one, do you?
Okay. So I’m your true forest friend.
Honey bears are just looking for your love.
Didn't I tell you if you eat too much honey you'll turn into honey?
They grow the pancakes big out here...
I can't tell - Is it  honey or is it a bear?
If you can turn me on, I'll give you some honey.
Okay, yell "insulin" on three...
Don’t worry-I packed some extra toast.
I guess bear bells are only effective for grizzlies.
Very funny John. You almost scared the hell out of me
Quick, make yourself look sweet!
Quick, hand me the bee spray.
Honey, don't panic. If we stay still, the adult woman will leave us alone.
If we lie perfectly still it will think we're bread.
This is not a good time to mention your first name, Ms Leoni.
Please hug me before I burst.
Watch out honey, he means beesness
zzuzuzuuuzzuzzuuzzzuzzuzuzuzzz
Honey, we tried to return to nature and we ran into a supermarket billboard, I hope.
Jesus Christ!   He's already got loads of honey -- why is he messing with us?
testing
This did not seem like one of the dangerous bears Donna and Mike had worried about.
Only you can prevent poorly seasoned food.
Quick - get the kettle!
I thought you said he was sweet?
So you’re “vegan for the animals” are you?
It would blow my mind if you could bear to be my main squeeze.
Let's go, I already have one.
Be careful, that ‘sweet’ act may be a trap
If we pretend like we're already stuck, he won't touch us.
Oh, no, you won't do.  I'm looking for biscuits.
Get my gun
I just spent 10 seconds in the microwave.  I run fast.
We swear neither of us have diabetes. Wait for the fat guy behind us on the trail. He’ll taste great!
Tell him we already gave  at the office....
Think I'll stop buying honey from China ...too many fluoroquinolones!
Can you BEAR the smell on Honey?
I hope you NRA people can run real fast.
If we lay down flat like a pancake at least it will be a sweet death.
I sure hope that's a recyclable bear.
"Seen any hollow logs? I'm about ready to hibernate?
Obviously someone said, "Sweet dreams" to you last night.
I told the Animal Liberation Brigade that this Born Free crap is not for everyone, but they refused to listen.
Oh God...he's so sticky.
Tell him we're saving the bees .
The bees stole my honey again. This time I'm gonna make them pay
Oh how sweet, she wants to eat us now!
I think she wants her gummy bears back.
Uh Oh we are on the menu out here...
I know it's Halloween but this wasn't cool.
I know it's a Honey Bear but I think YOU  should try squeezing him.
He seemed so sweet until I squeezed him.
She seems harmless.  Just don't mess with her honey and walk away slowly"
Mrs. Butterworth!!... I presume... we have decoupled??
Quiet......this is nothing to squeeze at
I’m sorry, but you’re in the “Süßigkeit-Forrest”, that means, if you’re not made out of something sweet, I’ll have to ask you to leave.
The bear contracted the common cold of honey!
In retrospect, I now understand why you found the roadside pancake house to be a little off-putting.
BooBoo!
He thinks we're toast!
I don't think VR grocery shopping is for us.
I did a test run on Halloween and it stuck. It's really me inside. Cute HUH?
Halloween has truly gone viral
This explains why the animals are so fat.
Didn't you read the warnings about plastic in nature?
Hey Honey please adopt me
Honey, I think that you finally found yourself on this trip.
Christopher Robin?
Pooh Bear? Noooo, this is MY honey!
Do... do we... eat him?
Honey makes everything more yummy, especially you
I guess that’s what happens to too much plastic waste.
I'm sure it's cosplay, even bears know that Halloween was last month.
Sure they may seem all sweet on the inside, but there so easy to see through.
Not our sweet sweet honey.
Should I  turn the clock ahead or back
You heard me right. I said: What that mouth do?
Sweet, no honey do list today!
Does a bear spritz in the woods?
Quick! Take the giant pancakes out.
Honey... I don't think those were shiitake mushrooms we found
It's a Madison Ave Scam Bear.I
Sure it looks sweet, but where's the creature that's using it?
happy halloween trick or treat!
Heh there are you coming to my party?
Dont be frightened. Inside, I'm really sweet.
Maybe this is the domestic honey we've heard about?
Present yourself as a large cup of tea.
Pardon me, I'm a bit lost...did you happen to see a large picnic when you went out in the woods today?
One size fits all
Lawn ornaments creep me out.
Yet another sticky situation for our heroine.
Wait’ll the Sierra Club gets wind of this bozo.
A Sticky Situation
NO! He's my Honey Bear!
In exchange for our lives, do you think he'd accept our bottles of honey?
Get the bug spray! I just know he has heard about getting more flies with honey.
Honey, you shrunk the humans!
KILLLLL MEEEEEE,” the abomination begged
Honey, is this man bothering you?
I like sweet tea as much as the next guy, but you promised you'd pack light!
Hand over all the lupins you’ve got!
I’d prefer blueberries to a smoked salmon sandwich
It all started when President Xi asked for some honey in his tea. I was then jailed, mistaken for some "Pooh Bear," but I managed to escape and have been hiding in these woods ever since!
Ma'am, I'm going to need you to tell me if you shrunk your kids. We've been getting a lot of complaints about that.
I've heard that what you're supposed to do in these situations is to brew up a big cup of tea with lemon.
Whatever you do, don't call me "honey!
Careful! They’re always sticky!
I have a feeling he is not organic.
I have more fructose than the average bear.
Quick, give him the nuts and Cheerios!
The plastic industry has taken over the woods.
How many edibles did we eat?
Be cool. Hand me the lemons.
Agree.  A plastic bee nakes more sense.
I can't believe he won't take off his Halloween costume...
If he’s friendly, we break out the bread. If not, we run.
The bears around here were never so sweet.
No, I asked for a honey beer.
I forget...Do we play dead or run to the kitchen cupboard?
The  sugar free is over there.
I must say, I think we both see the excess fat above your belt.
If this guy keeps following us, we'll end up in a sticky situation.
You know how you say I never date any one sweet?
The honey sticker is for the bees , i want to fly by eating them .
Honey what do we do about it?
Life sucks when you are a hungry bear.
Smokey THE Bear? Lose the "the."
Do you really think that the bear is all honey inside?
Is this forest organic?
THATS RIGHT
GOLD NUGGETS
YEAH  THEY ARE GOLD NUGGETS
NOW STOP SAYING
HONEY. THIS WAY
HONEY. THAT WAY
HONEY.........................
I ordered blueberries!
It's all about "Point of Purchase" these days
What do you think Larry, is that a real honey bear with no underwear?
Don't play dead in front of Mama Bear. She has a sweet tooth.
Honey, let's not provoke the sweet bear.
Do you think he knows Halloween was LAST week?
Did you know that you are unbearable?
They thought they could escape the rich, creamy texture of Su-Bear Honey...
The maple syrup is in aisle 5 with the pancake mix. This is the baking section.
Gratitude for his access to our trash cans?  How very sweet!
How's this for organic venti sweetner?
We were just saying that we prefer non GMO honey, that's all...no offense intended... Please don't make us eat you...
You're really gonna go out on a 'sticky situation' joke, Paul? That really seems like a good conclusion to your life?
We've got to tell Pooh, Smokey, Yogi, Baloo, and Fozzie!
I miss Smokey
It’s been following us since our conversation turned sour.
Aren’t the bears around here sweet?
No dear, I don’t sell scones.
Stand back honey bear, this is between me and honey bear.
Now slowly add the pepper spray.
Where’s my biscuit!?!
Sweet costume, dude, but Halloween was last week.
My Honey-Land is sweet.  But once you come in, you never leave.
Want something to sweeten your gorp?
Honey, he’s wearing a backpack just like mine.
This one’s a freebie. It’s “play dead and I’ll think you’re French toast.”
I don't sting. I'm the honey wholesaler.
So I guess we wasted our time coming out to harvest some organic honey.
let your honey give you some honey!
Are you a live honey bear? Like those honey containers that are shaped like bears, only giant, alive, and breathing? Or are you a regular bear, just with a weird hat dripping honey and a “Honey” label?
I'm hoooome! Aren't you happy to see me?
How can you be sure it’s not a Grizzly?
Careful.  If he feels squeezed we're toast.
Okay, sweet. But if soy sauce and garlic show up next, we run, because MARINADE.
Ah! Just as it happens in nature...a swarm of bees have filled up a bear’s actual body.
I'll give you the jarful of Honey, if you Bear me to the cave
Uh, well how bad could it be? It's organic.
Central Command. It’s a honey pot. I repeat, a honey pot. Over.
He may look sweet but don’t be fooled.
Agh!!! Sasquatch!
Did you see my wife? She ran off with an agate bear.
That syrup woman only asked for directions.
so who's watching the toaster?
That did it, Pooh Bear finally ate all the honey in the woods.
You forgot the toast?!
It's ok I am Pooh bears American cousin
I've been uptight and made a mess, but I'll  clean it up myself I guess, handle me with care.
This is what you get for calling me "honey".
Tell him we're vegans.
Yes, I said 'figuratively' that I could eat a giant honey bear bottle.
‘“Honey’ ? Did somebody say ‘honey’?”
Do you know where the patent office is? I want to file a complaint.
Honey. That ain't no bee
It says ‘honey’ but I’m pretty sure it’s full of cum
Have you seen a crumpet about this tall nearby?
Honey, bunny, let's have a party!
Nothing to worry about...he's already crystalized
Hi. I'm Golden Blossom, and I'm curios as to where you're heading. I do like to stay on top of things.
I told you we shouldn't have brought psychedelic mushrooms on our picnic.
This could prove to be a sticky situation.
We bears DO eat anything, yes, with the exception of bees.
Did you see the tea bird fly by?
Honey bear!" "What?! Oh... Not what I was expecting but okay?
Beware of strangers bearing gifts
Follow me to the bee hives.
Honey let's keep walking! This is too much to bare!
Who wants your Money? Trending is a Bear-ter for Water"
Sorry, we thought you were Mr. Xi.
Don’t believe it.  It’s a bunch of Pooh! Pooh!
What do me and a stick have in common?  We're brown and sticky!
"Has bee been flied over here?
Did you bring the honey, honey?
No, no, don’t play dead, he’ll think you’re toast!
Treat or trick!
Please tell me we remembered the bug spray.
I've escaped from amazon.com!
Quick, get the pancake batter
I don't know, Dad  . .There might be a Quo involved. Like we say What looting? We didn't see any corporate looting . . .
He's sticky to us.
Have you folks seen a swarm of bees around this neck of the woods?
Quick, let's make a run for Mrs. Butterworth!
John, please tell me you didn’t pack the multigrain toast.
Angry honey?  We ARE in an alternate universe!
have you seen any Tea Trees?
Me must sweeten your gluten-free unsweetened granola
Yum grub hub
Honey, don't get too close...he doesn't look sweet
Are you hiding from Winnie the pooh also?
Don't let that sweet expression fool you, he's more dangerous dressed like that!
Lucky for us that Mrs Butterworth is hiding behind that tree.
If you catch something, I will provide the seasoning.
Honey,Bee still and it will leave us alone!
You were expecting my brother Smokey? He’s in California.
How does this grab ya as a perfect disguise?
If we're careful we may escape without sticky hands.
You left the honey at home, right?
on god bro, out here in nature with all this loud gas and nothing to smoke with, if only we had an everyday around-the-house consumer product from which to MacGyver a bong— oh??
Honey, just give him your graham crackers...
We got our ass caught by a mascot!
Who's doing the squeezing now?
We’ve hit the mother-load hand me that empty canteen.”
Wait! This is a trap among fat and lazy bears. An easy prey!
I'm Smokey's mom
Are we in the Hundred Acre Wood?
I've heard of a honey bee but never heard of a honey bear.
Whewf, I've escaped the beehive!  
Which way to Whole Foods so I can reunite with my family?
Honey bear, do you see a honey bear?
Is it just me, or did that bear eat too much honey...?
Okay, you were right, Steve, that was Psilocybe cubensis.
Whatever you do, don't fall for his bear-hug prank.
It seems like Winnie the pooh snapped.
Do you think Winnie is following us?
'Afternoon folks.  Just a wild Grizzly here, sponsored by your local Honey Bear dealer.
Honey,please help me!!
Did you forget something?
Move slowly. The honey bear don’t care
I told you not to poke the Beyhive!
We're in a real sticky situation!
Wait, is that what the bear box does?
I bearly know you but looks like we are in a sticky situation...
Careful dear, she'll kill you with sweetness.
I told you, Cindy, bring only the bare necessities. B-a-r-e.
He's one of those bear proctologists!"
Honey, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Do either of you know the Sierra Club
This shape-shifter thing has gotten out of hand.
Yikes!  Is it maybe some sylvan attempt at middle-aged whimsy?
Oh, so that's what a lifetime supply of Suebee Honey looks like.
Shhhhh! Did you put the nut Cheerios in the bear canister?
Bill, it shows up every time you use that endearment! It's got to be the H-O-N-E-Y infabula!
Am I supposed to play dead or attack?
If you bake biscuits I've got the honey.
No agents Please! Only B2-Bee, the lazy but Hive-tech Newbies.
Just outgrown hitting the lid of honey jar I was imprisoned in by my mom for being naughty sometime ago
I'm your honey bear and I'm checking on whether a three-way relationship is meant to bee.
Honey, calm down." "John, the bear or me?
Quick! Find some stevia leaves!
It's none of your business where honey is"
Honey, this is why I told you I couldn’t bear the idea of camping
I've learned my lesson..I will never fall for another Honey Trap!
We' d b
Hey, I'm not done having you steal honey for me.
I love eating honey but certainly would not want to be eaten by honey!
Poo bear seems to be out of toilet paper.
Don't make any sudden movements, and slowly pass me my tea.
He's after those Cheerios I told you not to pack!
Don't fret, I'm all natural!
I think he may have over done it with the honey!
We should have seen it coming, (even though it can't move). Bear themed captions are trending.
First they’re sour, then they’re sweet.

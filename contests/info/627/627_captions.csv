I recommend the pigeon. It's locally sourced.
Weren't there three of you?
Table for two, by the window. Is there a problem?
Any dessert before you hit the road?
Ignore the screams, sir. I’ll get you a new fork.

Yes this is the smoking section.
I recommend starting with an order of wings.
If you find it too drafty, I can close the window.
Would you like to hear about our fall specials?

Well, the review did describe it as 'urban edgy.'
You reserved a table--and I quote--'away from everyone, with an unobstructed view of the city'."
Is this far enough from the kitchen for sir's liking?
The maitre d’ thanks you for the two dollars and hopes you enjoy your meal.
What do I recommend?  Don’t look down.
You can come back in, sir. Your wife just left.
Welcome to our Sarah Huckabee Sanders table
Yes, Madame, the pigeon is raised locally.

I'd avoid ordering the chicken -- it tends to attract hawks.
Vertigo's."..sounded Italian to me
Today' s Early Bird Special was captured on this ledge this morning.
You did request a table with a view.

Never let it be said we don't serve Administration officials.
Think twice about my tip.
I’d order quickly. The window closes in 10 minutes.
Weren't you a party of three?
Next time don’t drop Trump’s name.
Can I start you off with dessert, just in case?

It’s our take out menu.
It's our special pre-fall menu.
Your pigeon should be arriving any moment now.
My name is Henri and there is no way in God’s creation that I will be your server tonight.
Before I take your order, I would like you to take a few minutes to familiarize yourselves with the safety features of this table and chairs.
Tonight we have locally-sourced pigeon.
Yes, the chef is very familiar with your review from last time.
Sparkling, still, or rain?
The manager wants to let you know he appreciated the honesty of your online review.
We apologize for losing your reservation.  Our manager has informed me that your dinner will be on the house.

You had to mock his French accent didn't you?"
Sometimes I think you’re ashamed to be seen with me.
It's haute cuisine, but edgy.
Good evening sir, and yes, apparently the Maitre D' did remember your last visit.
The reviews said the view was breathtaking...
I and the rest of the waitstaff prefer all "Make America Great Again" discussions take place on the patio.
All of our meals are prepaid.
Can I start you off with some Xanax?
The food is ok, but most of our patrons come for the atmosphere
Bottled, tap or rain?
Well, you ordered the perch.

Thank you."
Just so you know, there's a one-drink maximum.
A table just opened up near the gargoyle, if you prefer.
If you will take another look at your Groupon, you will see it clearly states that dinner for two is "on the house," not "free."
If you feel a draft, I can close the window
Don't tip.
You must have read the review incorrectly. We’re a five story restaurant, but got a one star review.
I bet that table by the kitchen is looking pretty good now.
This was the only outdoor seating available.
Funny! His late wife used to sit right there.
As you requested, the smoking section.

When you asked for a table by the window, did you specify "inside"?
I'd recommend the cornice hen.
So, do you understand "al fresco" now?
Sparkling, or rain?
I assure you Madame, they only look like ants.
I hear the squab here is to die for.
And for your final course?
The chef says you may come in after you quit asking for gluten free options.
We apologize for the screaming.  I'll be right back with a new knife.
Can you hear the crying baby now, sir?
This was Karl Wallendas' favorite table.
It's a pleasure to honor your "free dinner coupon".
Folks, I wanted to let you know that we’ll be closing the window in about 15 minutes.
Yes, the Groupon said "rooftop" dining.
Is this your first time to a ledgetarian restaurant?

Will the other two guests be rejoining you?
I would suggest a well-balanced meal.
I don't want to push you, but have you folks decided on your order?
Yelp review: Edgy new restaurant brings city dining to new heights
"May I suggest the jumbo wings to start?"
This is the best view we have
I’d bring you more bread, but the pigeons will just keep taking it.
I should mention that our "No Tipping" advisory has nothing to do with gratuities.
Might I suggest the roast pigeon.  It is quite fresh and locally sourced."
Your drinks will be right out, Sir. 
Also, an Officer Davis on the phone  sends the message that "you have so much to live for."
May I suggest the wings?
This is our VIP table for the current administration's top staffers.
He heard we voted for Trump.
And if you're feeling more adventurous, we can start with a blind tasting.
You wanted our smoking section.
I am sorry Secretary DeVos. I've checked with the owner; this is our only available table this evening.
Ah, you must be the couple who talked politics with the Maitre D' .
Both the kitchen and window will be closing in fifteen minutes. Thank you
Don't feel bad, he loved playing the violin...
As requested, secluded, good view, not near the kitchen, no annoying music, away from the entrance.
It's not the height which scares most patrons, it's the width.
Best if you don't lean back like that...
Is this table close enough to the window for you?
The chef has designated this table for our vegan, gluten, dairy, sodium free patrons
No, honey I said " lets try some place edgy" not ledgy.
Is this your first high tea?
We recommend a heavy meal - winds are coming from the east and gusting to thirty miles per hour.
Welcome to our new patio dining experience.
Outdoor table with view, just as requested in your OpenTable reservation.
if it's too drafty, I can shut the window
Everyone asks for outside seating, and then they complain.
We shouldn't have told him we were Trump supporters
I recommend the wings.
If it gets too breezy, I'll close the window."
Your profile said that you like to live on the edge.
Enjoy the unobstructed view, but watch your step when you go to the rest rooms.
For starters, can I interest you in some breadcrumbs?
I wish they would call this something other than the fall menu.
Our specialty is the fresh wild squab, locally sourced, roof-to-table in 15 minutes.
Due to circumstances beyond our control, the strolling violinist is not available.
Sir, may I suggest the pigeon?
No chicken tonight...but we do have pigeon.
My apologies - your souffle fell.  Actually, it's still falling.
...and of course if you have any allergies please let me know, your safety is very important to us.
On today's menu, we have a recipe for disaster
I highly recommend the pigeon
Our waiter seems a little pushy; and that worries me.
Not only is the view great out here, Mr. and Mrs. DeVos, but we can assure you no protesters will interrupt your dinner.
Would you like some bread crumbs for the table?
Mind if we move you over a little to fit another party in?
May I suggest our term policy for $19.95.
I believe Monsieur and Madame have discovered that the, ahem, "wretched little table next to the men's room" has a newfound appeal, n'est ce pas?
My name is Adam and I'll be talking you down from the ledge this evening.
Will you be having the fall special, then?
May I startle you off with something?
A true gentleman would have pulled out my chair.
You must have missed the small print on the Groupon.
For you, I recommend the wings.
Your reservation specified that you were to be seated in a space, and I quote: "...where there will be absolutely no children."  
Bon appetit.
Have we decided, or are we still up in the air?
Maybe you shouldn't have joked that we were reviewers from the "failing New York Times."
Restrooms are located directly below you.
Any food allergies or phobias?
Might I suggest the roast pigeon?
No, I am the chef, a drone will deliver your meal.
The squab is quite fresh. It arrives daily.
Your farm-to-table dinners should land any minute now.

There's a high-wind advisory.
This is the table farthest from the kitchen. Bon Appetit

Next time, please let us know if you will be late.
For here?  Or to go?
This is where we seat folks who still ask for Trump Wine.
Do you have the Groupon with you, sir?
Groupon voucher, I presume?
The pigeon is very, very fresh.
Would you prefer the window open or closed?
May I recommend the '66 Haut Brion.  The scintillating bouquet of dark fruit, forest floor, and smokey cedar pair well with the dumpster fire in the alley.
What? Your profile said 'living on the edge' and 'drinks with a view.'
You may come inside when you finish your vegetables.
We find this is less passive aggressive than spitting in your food.
You did ask if we had a smoking section.
Tonight's special is free range pigeon.
Is this table more comfortable, Secretary DeVos?
Try the pigeon,it's locally sourced
Is this far enough from the kitchen to meet your request sir?
You just had to tell them I voted Republican didn't you!
If you don't tip me, I tip you.
You ordered take-out, right?
I'll give you a few minutes to decide if you're willing to look down at the menu.
My name’s George. I’ll be your next waiter for the evening.
I see that you have some table reservations.
You said you wanted a table with a killer view
At Vertigo, you tip us and we don't tip you."
Let me know if you want to send your food back again.
Can I start you off with a little something for the vertigo?
Next time...Make a reservation.
I heard the free-range pigeons are to die for.
You should start with the wings.
But you must admit, the view is breathtaking.
No complaints about the view this week, sir?
Pay no attention to the gathering crowd.
This table has a two drink maximum.
You just missed the early birds.
I suggest the wings.
Appetizer? Wings, perhaps?
Well, you did say “as far from the kitchen as possible”, didn’t you?
I'm guessing you booked through Open Table?
You’re the one that wanted to go to the edgiest restaurant in the city.
Let me guess, you slipped the maître d' a single.
My name is Marcel and I am here to talk you down.
As you requested, a quiet table in the corner, and a great view.
This time,tip!
It’s our early fall menu.
Well, I see you won't be needing the third menu after all.
If madame and monsieur will follow me, a table has opened up in the stairwell.
We actually coined the phrase "Good to the last drop".
We are known mostly for our atmosphere.
If you’d like, a table has just opened next to the urinal.
The lady in the room right across from you should be starting her show in five minutes.
So, is this far enough from the kitchen and restrooms?
Well, you did request "al fresco."
I would suggest skipping the bread unless you really, really like pigeons.
The reviews said edgy...
Did you really have to insist on a table with a better view.
Would you like to start with something to take the edge off?
Is this far enough away from the band
Chef says your salad will be tossed sweetheart. Your steak too.
We have a selection of canopies below.
Either you tip me or I tip you
I believe they are chanting  at you to skip dessert and jump, sir.
Your first responder will be with you shortly
The perch special is an excellent choice.
I hope you now understand our smoking policy.
It's down the ledge and to your right.
May I remind you you did ask for the terrace.
So, I think you'll find kitchen noise a bit less irritating now.
The rest of your party is here.
Yes sir, this definitely is the Upper East Side!
Tonight, payment in advance will be kindly required.
When you've made up your mind, you can come back inside.
When they said this place was edgy, I thought they meant the food.
Please be patient. We've lost several waiters recently.
No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to dine.
As you can see , the pigeon we serve is locally sourced.
I did warn all three of you not to push your chairs back too far.
Today's special is perch.
I’ll bring menus as soon as you sign the waivers.
I don’t mean to rush you, but the window will be closing in five minutes.
I said, I like living on the edge, not the ledge.
You said you'd take the last corner table we had available.
Sparkling, still, or rain gutter?
Please accept our apology.  The chef thought you were with the current Administration.
Not what I had in mind when I said 'let's eat out.'
We noted your last Yelp review mentioned your table was too close to the kitchen.
Dinner is on the house.
If you put a matchbook under the leg, it'll be less tippy.
We're uploading the full menu to the cloud.
You're the one who wanted to be reseated as far away from the kitchen as possible!
I believe your reservation simply requested outdoor seating.
Our special of the day will be landing shortly.
May I suggest something not too heavy.
Just think, I had to call two months in advance for the corner table"
The special tonight is cornice hen.
Sparkling, tap, or if you wait five minutes, rain?
These prices seem really high.
Yes Sir...this is where we put all the lawyers.
The restrooms are to the gentleman’s left.

Is there table service or do we order at the window?
Sir, all of our cuisine is haute.
You insisted on a table by the window.
When I said ‘Ideally, a table in a corner location with good views...’
I'm sorry, there will be no wine pairing tonight. Our sommelier had a slight misstep.
The Yelp review was literally a yelp.
My sister is joining us.
They said al fresco
You really meant it when you said,  “I’m Going to get us a table no matter what.”
I wouldn’t recommend anything heavy.
How many were you?
It's our special Fall menu.
Yes, we are a 3-star restaurant, and you will see them all shortly after sunset.
Try the pidgeon
What kind of dive is this?
Why can’t you just admit you forgot about our anniversary again?
Can I get you something to take the edge off?
We were curious if you finally found the temperature to your satisfaction
You HAD to ask for a table with a view.
We were only able to squeeze you in due to a last minute 
catastro... er cancellation.
Gratuities are mandatory, if you know what I mean.
The souffle is not available. It fell.
The pidgeon is excellent, and fresh.
And for dessert, I recommend our pie in the sky.
Yelp recommended it for its edgy vibe"
We've been over this a thousand times. This is not a restaurant, I am not a waiter, and there is no soup du jour. I'm wearing this for an audition. Now, please come back inside, mom and dad.
Everything is a little steep here, don’t you think?
You wanted a table in the smoking section, right?
You dropped the fork, you pick it up.
I would recommend the "Death by Chocolate" as a better choice.
I trust THIS table isn't "too close to the kitchen."

Mr Robinson, your wife has gone now. Would you like to come back inside?

We will begin with the check, obviously
I see you dropped your napkin, sir.
Look down and you'll see our Fall Special is an Egg Drop Soup–it's to die for.
The usual, Mr. Cruise?
Reviews called this an “edgy new restaurant”. So far so good.
I recommend the Linguini Afraido or the Petrified Sole.
On the front of the menu you will see todays specials and if you turn to the back, our insurance policy.
Should I tell him I dropped my fork again?
"If you want to see and be seen, this is the table.
It says terror, not terroir.
Will others be joining you?
I'm afraid your only options are  tossed salad and the catch of the day. I'll do the tossing and you can do the catching...
I recommend you start with dessert.
Sorry for the delay, my name is Herbert and I'll be your replacement waiter.
Dining out, are we?
Don't worry, you will have that sidewalk table before you know it.
We read your online review. Rest assured, you will never sit near the kitchen, again.
Tipping is not required but greatly encouraged.
We've brought dining alfresco to a whole new level.
Would that be close enough to a window, sir?
Greetings. The Specials for this evening are perched on the board behind you."
Most restaurants don't even have a smoking section.
I assure you this is the best table in the whole restaurant, Mrs Clinton, compliments of our new owner, Donald Trump.
No matter what happens, this time we leave a large tip.
I used a new website,  "Open Window", to book our table!

Squab.  See one you like?
We only ask that you please don't tip.
I suggest the cornice hen.

I see you have selected our discounted Restaurant Week option.
I know you said this new place was 'edgy,'  Gerald, but really!!!
For a positive Yelp review I can seat you on our patio WITH railing.

You did say 'first available."
You can bring your table in when you two start getting along.
The maitre d'  said you used to beat the snot out of him in school.
Mon dieu.  You told me you wanted the table farthest from the kitchen.
It's a one drink limit on the ledge.
And our pigeon is ledge-to-table.
No.  I would recall if I've eaten here before.
All you said,dear,was to make reservations and to be sure to get a table by the window.
The pigeon is locally sourced. It’s ledge-to-table.
Would you like me to tell you about our specials or talk you off the ledge?
And what would you like for your last meal?

But you said, 'As far away from the kitchen as possible'.
'Forgive me, but the hostess, she inform me you are a party of THREE, no? - Ah, sacré bleu, not again!'
Will anybody else be joining you?
This isn't what I meant when I said, 'Let's go someplace edgy.'
Yes madam, this seating is the furthest we have from the kitchen.
I assume you didn't tip the maitre d.
My name is Wallenda- I will be your server tonight.
You DID ask for a table next to the window.
This place is just a little too edgy ... don't you think??
I told you to stop complaining about being so close to the kitchen, but no . . .
May I suggest the upside-down cake.
You're right - the view does take your breath away.
And should you need it, the bathroom is one ledge above.
If you're leaning toward the salad...Don't.

Well, honestly, would you rather be here or in front of the men's room?
We also have some tables by the dumpster, but it's a 20 minute wait.

Well, you insisted on a table with a skyline view.
Your meal today will be on the house.
And our catch of the day is free range Pigeon
Everything OK? You two seem a little on edge.
Tonight's special is mashed acorn squash with crushed garlic, in honor of the approaching fall.
I don't think I made myself clear when I asked for a table next to the window.
Wow! When you said you knew a little, out-of-the-way place where nobody goes, you weren’t just talking.
I hear the pigeon is delicious.
I told you there was only room for two at that table.
We’re excited to have fresh squab on the menu tonight
Any allergies or fears I should know about?
We prefer to call it squab
Hi folks, any allergies or conditions we should be aware of? Gluten? 
Acrophobia? Restless leg syndrome? Visual height intolerance? Vertigo?
Our apologies. There will be a short wait for the pigeon.
Although I told you that we are completely booked, YOU insisted on being seated !
I hope you understand that if either of you falls off, the other will still be responsible for the check.
Didn’t realize this is what you meant by adventurous eater in your profile.
Your hook and ladder will be with you shortly.
Our menu selections are, of course, quite good, but we are really known for the atmosphere.
Your profile was right, you are an adventurous eater.
You and your outside dining.
Sorry, folks, but this is the only window seat left.

Sorry, this is the "to go" window.
May I suggest no wine with dinner.

Fine. Your meal will be on the house.
When you said patio restaurant, I was expecting something a little more chic.
This is a cozy little table in the corner, kinda out of the way.
We saw your review on Yelp.  We weren't expecting you to return.
Your fortunate to get this table; the City only approved our new ledge service last week
And how do we like our “remote little corner somwhere”, Sir?
Have you made up your minds yet?
Tonight's special is the Squab.
Our special this evening is local pigeon.
Well, at least we're not next to the bathrooms!!!

When I saw “Al Fresco” in the reservations, I thought that was the guy’s name, not how he was requesting to dine.
If you’d like, I can start you off with the soup d’jour, adrenaline with a purée of terror.
To tip or not to tip
I made a reservation for the table with the best view
Text Zagat….Food fine, service adequate,
BUT Dubious Atmosphere
Yes, this table has a special ambience.
A waiter is now included with every Blue Apron order.
I suggest not asking for the vegetarian menu like the other table did.
You know about restaurants serving Dinner in the Dark, don't you? Well, our specialty is Dining Dangerously.
First time dining with us?
Yes, my reservation was for a table near a window. Why do you ask?
They're serious about the no tipping policy.
Nice breeze isn't it".

(internal dialogue)... yes, i should be a solid contender now as the NY always picks dull caption
It's not for nothing we are known as the edgiest restaurant in Manhattan.
Order to go
I’m sure glad we sprang for the dumbwaiter
Like trying fugu only without the fugu.
May I suggest the vol-au-vent?
There's only pigeon pie, but it's very locally sourced.
You had to ask for the smoking section.
If he asks if  we like the food, say that it's really good.
And now do madame and monsieur think we serve haute cuisine?
At least the prices haven't gone through the roof.
Stepping out tonight, I see. May I start you off with our clams oreganata. They’re to die for.
I'm not sure why you two are sitting outside my window looking at blank menus again, but I've already told you, I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD!
I think I'll skip the pigeon ravioli
Help yourselves to our roof-top garden salad bar....
The maître d' has informed me that the crowd below is live-streaming your dining experience.
Best rooftop table, as you asked, sir.
Welcome to our super-boutique al fresco dining experience.
when you said you were going out on a ledge to impress me, I was expecting something different...
It's very exclusive, allegedly.
Sir, you're therapist is on the line. She says that you have to follow all of her instructions
Tonight’s appetizer special is vol au vent.
If you are not happy, please let me know.
Are there any gluten allergies I should be aware of?
Who's Al Fresco?
I know what you’re asking yourself right now. “Am I dreaming?”
Our special this evening is a post-meal jump from the ledge. It pairs superbly with our seasonal existential dread- a selection of angst, ennui, and weltschmerz.
Someone told me the chef's style is really edgy!
Your window of opportunity will be closing soon.
The smog makes this more romantic.
Can I talk you off the wedge?
You asked for edgy. What were you expecting?
May I suggest our braised wings?
Our diners usually want to avoid the rush.
If you see anything flying past that you fancy, let me know.
Why did you say we were looking forward to dining out!
He took her literally, not seriously, having learned nothing from the last election.
Madame, Sir?, may I suggest something a little less....adventurous?
My recommendation is the "pigeon under glass," our freshest entrée this evening.
Whatever you do, don't order anything too heavy.
Oops, I dropped my fork.
We're here because of their locally sourced squab, that's why.
Perhaps, next time, the gentleman will consider at least a 20% tip.
You came at a busy time.
Madame et Monsieur, les Spécialités ce soir sont Bird Nest Soup Francais, Le Pigeonne Grillé, et L'Omelette des Pigeonnes. 
Bon appétit!
When they told us our meal was on the house I didn't take them literally did you?
If you're too on edge to order I can come back.
Chef says fear heightens yours sense of taste.
Are we taking a chance with the new chef?
I thought you said your Name was Al Fresco
Might I suggest the squab tartare - it’s the freshest in town.
I understand you’ve just come from seeing the play ‘Hello Dali’.
Please let me know if the flambé smoke continues to bother you.
This takes Al fresco to new heights
Shall I throw you your starters?
The chef’s special tonight is pigeon under glass with buckshot overtones.
Their lemon drop martini is to die for!
For safety reasons, your al fresco table does not include silverware.
Today's specials include a laugh at your expense.
Can I talk you down from any appetizers this evening?
Many find this to be a heightened dining experience.
Do you want me take your photo to share on Facebook and then you can come eat inside?
Everyone wants by a window.
'REMEMBER, YOU ARE THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.'
I suggest you make a reservation if you insist on a window seat.
First cereal bars, now this? I'm close to the edge.
It's part of the New Cruelty Movement...
How about a drink to take the edge off?
Why is that man watching us?
Darling, this is not my idea of a legendary bistro.
Would you like to start with drinks, or a safety call?
When I asked for a table with an easy out in case the date went bad, this is NOT what I had in mind!
This IS our best table!
You're the one who insisted on a table by the window
You may choose from our more traditional items on the left, or our edgy selections on the right.  All cocktails are at-your-own risk.
I recommend the veal Oh My God.
What the hell is the bird dropping’s salad?
I presume you want the fettuccini without the wide noodles.
Today’s fresh selection is Grilled Pidgeon Crepinette
You requested a corner table, sir
We have a nice table in the alley
It's always better to reserve a table in advance, but I hope you will enjoy your meal anyway.
Let's go light on the "be merry."
It's allegedly the best table in town.
Let's get his recommendation for something that won't appeal to pigeons.
Could I start you off with a sedative this evening?
We pride ourselves on being one of the edgiest restaurants in New York.
Hope we won’t be charged for that table side Caeser Salad.
Madam, Sir, scoot back and relax while I fetch your favorite wine.
Will the other guest be rejoining you, or should we serve them where they landed?
Don't complain about anything!
The fresh catch of the day is locally-sourced Squab. In fact, they're on the ledge above you right now.
The prices are sky high here.
Edgy menu....don't you think?
Your squab appetizer is en route.
...well, you requested outdoor seating ...and didn’t want to wait.
Specials tonight are tossed salad, beef tips, eggs over easy, and apple turnovers. However, I'm afraid the souffle has fallen.
Thank you for requesting seating in the Trump Suppoter Room here at The Effete Snob.  One moment please and I’ll never be back to take your order.
This relationship has been making me feel really on edge lately...
Poulet un Verre?" "Nope, that's pigeon!"
Our chef's special today is pigeon pie. It's very fresh.
Tip is optional.
Is this table with a view to your liking, Madam?
Here at Café Vertigo, we excite the inner ear as well as the palate.
The House of Squab is Committed to the ledge-to-table movement.
The Early Bird Special? .. You’re sitting on it.”

Jim Hein, Pittsburgh, Pa.
This table is for people who criticize Trump.
May I suggest the Fallen Angel Cocktail?  Also, today's special - a delicately balanced seafood dish - is a bargain due to plunging lobster prices.
Terrace dining is so yesterday.
No table service this evening. Just cafeteria style. '
May I suggest the Fugu fish?
You can look at the menu or look down to see that your dining experience here will be "ledge n dairy"!
I thought you said this meal was on the HEDGE fund.
The special tonight is a rope ladder and the soup is lobster bisque.
I told you we shouldn’t have trusted Groupon.
They say this place is very Out There
Rooftop. Private. You got what you asked for. Maybe be more careful with your food order.
Chef’s special tonight is part of our street-to-table menu. Pigeon under glass. Enjoy.
They have the view, but their local, organic, free trade, gluten-free, non-GMO, cruelty free, vegan selection is sparse.
Eclectic menu. I'd go as far as to say edgy.
Just to let you know there’s a surcharge for random pigeon droppings.
Do you have any questions about the restaurant week menu?
Oui monsieur, the pigeon pie is very fresh.
Did you want to reconsider your request to have a table as far away from the kitchen as possible?
I don't think this is the farm-to-table experience you were thinking of.
The restroom is three floors down and it's a bit tricky.
Today's special is roast pigeon.
The view from the 90th floor is much better.
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
Squab anyone?
Thank you for coming to Pigeon's Roost. Your waiters will be up once they're done with the breadcrumbs that fell to the street.
Drat, that's the third busboy we've lost this week.
You decide what comes next.
Your dining experience will be as balanced as the gratuity.
…and we have dessert to die for.
Unfortunately, our best table isn't our safest, sir.
Unfortunately, our table side Guacamole is no longer available. Sir.
We no longer offer table-side guacamole."
Excuse me, you can't be out there.
You are limited to one alcoholic beverage, due to risks of injuries related to falls.
Sorry, we are not allowed to use silverware anymore.
And to avoid any interruption in your plans for the rest of the evening , we hope to see your five-star review before the dessert course.
Might I recommend "another restaurant"?
Pop up restaurants always scare me
Ready to take the plunge on our appetizers?
May I start you off with a draft?
One who insists on a seat by the window gets a seat by the window.
Oh, and my wife, Marie, sends you her kindest personal regards, Monsieur.
The wine list is on the left.  To the right is the waiver you will need to sign.
You said you wanted a table with a view!  Are you going to be one of those hard-to-please customers? Because if you are, they are barbequing rats on the E-train....
We're taking farm-to-table to a whole new level.
Bernard, on a first date, tries to act nonchalant, thinking "their prices are through the roof"!
Your date is not to blame, madame: five Michelin stars means that this is the best available table WITH a reservation.
So, Mr. Big Shot, are you still happy with your decision to give him the quarter instead of the twenty?
I'm so sorry about this, but there's a ten dollar up-charge for splitting a plate. Is that still okay?"
Don't look down when you're eating..
Well, you should just be happy they still have a smoking section.
You look like you might prefer something safe, for starters.
You'll find the cocktails in our drop down menu.
Well, you said you didn't want a table near the kitchen.
Is that your foot or are you just happy to see me?
So, you asked for a table near the window?
Is this “ al fresco “ enough for you?
Don’t even think about not leaving a good tip!
Let's hurry up and order. This limited seating must be in demand.
The review didn't actually say "patio dining." It just said "al fresco."
They only THINK the stock market is going to crash?
I only fear your souffle will fall.
Before we order, I think we should talk about our finances dear.
Haute cuisine
Didn't you say you were looking for an edgy dining experience?
And, do you prefer red or white with your diesel exhaust and pigeon poop?
Best to order before the pigeons arrive.
What's the problem?  You asked for al fresco, you got al fresco!
Before I take your order, please note that this is a 'prepay' window.
Today our specials are....oh never mind, I'm not coming out there anyway.
He looks like he's feeling as on-edge as I am.
Beats being next to the bathroom.
For those living on the edge, may I suggest starting with a gin and meclizine...
Everyone's dying to get a table.
We don't have outdoor service even if you bring your own furniture
Don't let the absence of pigeons sway you in your choice of entrees.
You always make me feel so on edge!
Technically it’s an outside table, but they still don’t allow dogs.
Pigeon tartare, pigeon crudite, pigeon antipasto misto, pigeon bolognese, pigeon gnocchi, pigeon biscotti and pigeon caffe vito.  Any allergies?
Perhaps Madame will temper how aredently she insists on a “table with a view” next time.
I recommend the non-alcoholic high ball.
Great question. Yes, the squab is very locally sourced.
No, Mr.Wells, we did not appreciate the Times' review of our establishment.
I told you the smoking section would be lousy seats
I'm sorry, we're out of the parachutes. May I recommend the hang-glider?
The Yelp review said allegedly.
May I bring you a couple parachutes as a starter?
And our seafood special this evening is "Scallops sur Scaffolding"
Some of our patrons just fell for the atmosphere.
Frankly, I thought the chef's table would be closer to the kitchen.
Tonight’s throwing menu features: meatballs, over ripe tomatoes, and a chocolate cream pie.
I just didn't know an Open Table at HEIGHTS for BITES was going to be this.
We are gonna need that table back for an 845 res so can I get you started with some apps?
Maybe tip bigger next time?
This is the seating section for our "coupon" customers. This is why we require you to present it in advance.
This place is a bit high-end for my taste.
come on order all ready
I'm going to live on the edge here and order the mussels.
I'm not sure if you've heard about our new "No Tipping" policy?
Blind dates really put me on edge

May I suggest the pigeon stew?
The surf and turf looks good.
I know it is uncomfortable, but I am not sitting in the same room with David Remnick.
Is this your first time dining with us at 
Rooftop to Table?
Our special tonight is the squab.

Sorry, the cake is not available. It fell today.
Who let the dogs in?
Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom.
I assure you, the risotto won't be THAT bad.
maybe you shouldn't have asked for a smoking area
Ze white tablecloth is ze parachute you ordered, Mr. Cruise.
I might be out on a limb
Finally, a fitting punishment if they stiff me on the tip.
I’ll have a sautéed perch.
Perhaps I could interest you in one of our fall specials, yes?
Will they fall for today's special?
Let me be clear.Trendy and edgy ARE mutually exclusive.
You did request 'as far from the kitchen as possible.'
It was this or sitting next to the bathroom.
We offer a cutting-ledge culinary experience.
Something to celebrate your new high?
Dropped or over easy?
Honey, we are no closer to the RestRooms out here!
I had read that this places is almost over the top.
I suggest the pigeon.

I've got a matchbook if you need...
Are you enjoying the view, now?
Would you mind sitting outside? everything inside is taken
This isn't what I expected when they said 'table with a view'.

Are you waiting for someone or should I call an ambulance?
My apologies, sir, though you really should call a day in advance.
Fancy words big fella. You just may push me into falling for you"

You asked for no smoking, oui?
Order something now or else I'm kicking you both off the ledge.

Maybe we shouldn't have insisted on a table by a window.

Sir, you did ask for our most secluded corner table.
No, I don’t recommend the pigeon flambé tonight.
They say that the cuisine is very edgy.
This is our 'people who didn't tip last time' seating area. I can start you out with our signature spit-wads?
We only have the pigeons WITH feathers.
I know we promised a railing after your last date. It's just hard to find a good contractor.
Today, we are featuring the pigeon.
Don't even think about jumping off to avoid the bill.
Do you wish to table your decision until supper time?
Oddly enough, she thought her dentist son's toothiness tattoo and his roofer husband's roofiness tattoo were living too close to the edge, and she hit the roof.
You’re too old for such an edgy haircut, Honey.
Do we jump before or after the main course?

I  am feeling a bit on edge. How are the high balls
Should we just order the caption again?
I would recommend the squab, but the family might pay you a visit during the meal.
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE OFFERING MORE THAN DINNER?
One false move Harry and it's all over.
These rooftop tables are HIGHLY desirable
I am ze Chef and ze Chef ezz never wrong.  Or you’re outta here.
Le Plat du Jour is to die for.
Our special tonight is fresh roasted pigeon.
So sorry.  That’s the fifth waiter we lost thai week.  I have another sent out immediately.
I thought you said G-astronomical heights!
The landlord raised the rent at their prior location.
I’m sorry to say we’re all out of the Elephant Steak tonight.
May I suggest the escargot for $24 and the filet of sole almondine for $43. Meat dishes that require a cutting motion and also unfortunately alcohol consumption are restricted by our insurance carrier due to our precarious seating arrangements.
Tipping is entirely at your discretion
wwww
I'd be more comfortable out here if I didn't feel a distinct tremor coming from the vicinity of that window.
Why are we always on the edge?
Today's special is rock pigeon.  Kill it with your menu, toss it over to me--the pigeon that is, not the menu--and I'll see you in a couple of hours or so.  Sorry we're out of bread sticks.  Enjoy.
There is a ten dollar cover charge, regardless of the weather.
If you're thinking you'll stiff me on the tip, think again.
The specials for tonight are wind-with-surprising-force and local squab, raised here on this ledge.
"Would you like your parachutes well-done?"
I’m so sorry sir, but the specialty of the house, squab in wine sauce has just a moment ago flown away
Extra air, $50
Now I see why he named his restaurant 'Competitive Edge'
This isn’t exclusive, this is abhorrently absurd!
But, sir, you did request dining al fresco at a top flight restaurant.
They wanted free range duck, right?
Would you like pigeon droppings on your salad sir?

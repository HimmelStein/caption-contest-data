You should see the couch they have at the urologist's office.
The last place I saw a couch like this also charged by the hour
What do uou mean MY oral fixation?
Are you going to help me or is this just lip service?
Shouldn’t you be sitting in an ear?
It just feels like everyone is kissing my ass
So this is the famous Freudian's lip.
MY oral fixation?!
Oh, and I suppose that sometimes a couch is just a couch.
Can you make the tongue do that again?
No, Doc, I said "tulips" would make your office more inviting
And what couch do you use for anal retentives?
It’s much more comfortable since you injected it with collagen.
These lips stay sealed, right?
I'm just glad I don't have an anal fixation.
The same dream every time--I'm being eaten, while you just take notes.
I also have a fear of being swallowed.
Last time I was on a couch like this, I was also paying by the hour.
The dreams are now mostly about Mick Jagger
I feel as if you are only giving me lip service.
It stopped. Could I trouble you for another quarter?
I ask for help, and all you give me is lip service.
I think our sessions are helping, but my wife keeps asking how I got lipstick on my collar . . . . and my jacket . . . and my pants.
Are you sure these lips are sealed?
It just seems like everyone's trying to kiss my ass.
The upper lip is a bit stiff.
So what's eating me, doc?
How did I hear about you?  Word of mouth.
Quite frankly doctor, I feel like all I get here is lip service.
I don’t think I’m the one with the oral ‘fixation here.
Well, Dr. Lipz, I guess I should be grateful Dr. Butz wasn't taking new patients.
It's crazy, but everything I see reminds me of her.
Something is gnawing at me.
My main problem is that I repeatedly seek advice from people with bad judgment.
You can be honest with me doc.  I don't want to just lie here and get my ass kissed for an hour.
Me?  You're the one with the oral fixation!
The tongue is a bit unsettling.
I feel like all I ever get from you is "lip service."
This seems to be more about you than it is about me.
You promised results, but all I'm getting is lip service.
Have you got any other advice besides, "You can't always get what you want?"
I bet you're  a Stones fan.
Isn't this really more of a love seat than a couch?
Is this a *Freudian* slipcover?
Sometimes a couch is just a couch, right?
Is this a new couch? Or just a Freudian slipcover ...
You're not fooling anyone doc.  You can put lipstick on a couch but it's still a couch.
I have the recurring dream that I am a harmonica
I’m glad the braces are off
I'm OK with the sofa, but the tongue pillow is creeping me out.
I don't get it, doc. Suddenly I'm having these nightmares about the Rolling Stones.
How’s your wife’s interior design business doing?
The couch is fine, but the nostrils on the ceiling are starting to creep me out."
I'm sorry, it's on the tip of my tongue.
They're Freudian lips.
I prefer the breast couch
for some reason I don’t feel like talking about my mother right now.
Is this part of the therapy, or just bad taste?
It's the tongue I find unsettling.
I may have an oral fixation, but you’re a classic enabler.
Yes, I do feel like something is eating at me.
I see you have an oral fixation too.
A couple of more sessions and we may have this licked.
I don't know how you're doing it,Doc,but I'm starting to believe that I can lick my problems.
Seems like all I get is lip service.
I just felt a smirk.
Is this putting your money where your mouth is?
Your lips are sealed, right?
Maybe it would help if you sat on a big ear.
Mother wore this color.
Is this where I kiss $100 an hour goodbye?
I said my problems were eating me alive. This isn't helping.
My problem? Who’s the one here with the sexual fantasy couch and the Hugh Hefner jacket?”
Well, I have been feeling better since you got the braces off.
Were you really Mick Jagger's shrink?
Are these lips really sealed?
How do I explain lipstick on my entire suit?
I'm starting to see symbolism everywhere, Doc.
I thought you said I would be in good hands?
Well , you see doc, I can't get no satisfaction.
I don't know why, but I have this feeling people are talking behind my back.
I had the dream again. The one where I'm in a New Yorker cartoon.
Would you happen to have a breath mint?
I see symbols of sex in everyday objects.
Really? I'm the narcissist, Dr. Lipschitz?
If this couch could talk, right?
I’m not sure that I’m comfortable talking about my mother on this couch.
The tongue is making me very uncomforable
You know doc, I think this couch says more about you than any story I can tell you about my mom.
Her smile still haunts me.
Actually, I'm starting to question YOUR life choices.
I leave every session stuck on the thought that I just can't get no satisfaction....
I don't know doctor, I just feel I over sexualize everything.
Let me tell you what's eating me.
I can't escape the feeling that I am in a caption contest.....
This couch sucks
So you were Mick Jagger's shrink?
Me? I think you're the one with the oral fixation.
I could also use a hug.
Sofa, so good.
Are you talking to me or the couch when you say "spit it out"
I shudder to think how you treat your patients with an anal fixation.
You got to be the psychiatrist last time.
Me and my big mouth
I'm not sure why doctor, but I suddenly feel that I can't get any satisfaction?
You can say "Sometimes a couch is just a couch," all you want. This still makes me uncomfortable.
I see reminders of her everywhere I go.
I'm guessing you're a Freudian.
...and you think I’m the one with an oral fixation?
If these lips could talk!
Let me guess. On sale at Target?
Doctor, I feel you're just giving me lip service.
Sometimes a couch is just a couch.
Can I give you a piece of advice? Kiss this couch goodbye.
Shouldn’t yours be an ear?
Would you by chance have a mint?
Ceci n'est pas une chaise longue.
I can’t possibly be gayer than this sofa.
Well, it beats the one with the teeth.
Something's eating at me, Doc.
I don’t recall; but I feel as though it’s right on the tip of my tongue.
It's okay, but I think the ChapStick may be ruining my suit.
Perhaps you misunderstood, I wanted you to help me with my lisp.
No, I don't feel like I'm being tested. I feel like I'm being tasted.
These sessions have helped. I now have the courage to tell everyone to kiss off.
$300 per hour, and you couldn't afford a matching chair?
I have this recurring dream that I’m on tour with The Rolling Stones
MY fantasies?  What about YOUR fantasies?
Is this couch doing anything later?
Wait, are you drawing me?
I need more than lip service from you
Actually, you're the only one who brings up the oral fixation thing.
You were the only psychiatrist in my network who also had a degree in interior design.
I wish you wouldn’t gloss over everything.
You’re right. It’s hard to feel blue on this thing.
My obsession? It's your sofa, Doctor.
I think your new couch may have swallowed my wallet.
You're right, not everything is black or white.
Well as delusions go, I'm not sure I want it to go away.
Nice Freudian slip cover.
Your couch needs a Freudian slipcover.
Doc, I'm afraid of large women and somehow it's getting worse.
I heard about you through word of mouth.
Its like I'm putting words in her mouth.
I'd  rather have a hug.
And how long have you been practicing out of your daughter's dorm room?
It really feels like there's something eating at me, Doc
And your black chair. . . what the significance of that choice?
Maybe we should be talking about YOUR mother.
Is this what they call a Freudian's lip?
Tell me doctor about YOUR relationship with your mother.
I've been coming here for decades, lying on this couch, and I still can't get no satisfaction.
So what would you call this, a 'Freudian's lip'?
So, Bob, what's eating you?
I'd hate to see how you treat anal retention.
Are these lips sealed as well?
Sometimes I feel like this world is just eating me alive.
Thank you for letting me be the patient today, Bob.
I don’t know why, but ....Mick Jagger
Is it me, or does the New Yorker have altogether too many therapy cartoons?
I think I share better on mid-century modern!
I don't know... every time I come here, I feel a little down in the mouth.
I feel like a cigarette.
Favorite musical? Kiss Me Kate. 
Favorite movie? Kiss Me Goodbye.
Favorite band? Kiss.
Why do you ask?
Well, if you must know, I'm feeling a little down in the mouth.
Is this the same couch I was on before I took the psilocybin?
What sofa do you use for someone who is anal retentive?
What happened to the giant breast I lay on last week?
Forget the therapy, how much do you want for this couch?
The collagen injections have really done wonders for the couch.
It's a Freudian slipcover.
When do I get to meet the rest of your furniture?
Can you help—or am I just paying for lip service?
Did you say 'edible?' Or Oedipal?
So ... sometimes a couch is just a couch?
I'm OK. I only come here for the couch.
Hey, are you the guy who used to run the love motel over in Jersey?
Your couch sucks!
Me and my big mouth. That's why I'm here.
Did you write 'Oedipal' or 'edible'?
With all due respect, I don't think I'm the one with an oral fixation.
Are we discussing my oral fixation or yours?
Maybe you should see a professional decorator.
Yes, I do prefer this to the hand chair.
I see you've made some Freudian lips.
To be honest, I only come for the couch.
I think the LSD is starting to kick in.
I had that dream again, where you have a normal-looking couch
I think that was a Freudian lip.
I'm really glad we got past the anal stage!
I’m glad your couch isn’t French.
What oral fixation?
You think I’m the one with an oral fixation?
I'm not saying I don't like the couch. I just think I might be paying you too much.
It's right on the tip of my tongue.
What happens when I move out of the oral stage?
For once, I feel loved.
My oral  fixation?  It's not my couch.
I like the couch, but the giant eyes over there are making me anxious.
Thank goodness I don’t have an anal fixation.
How long until the museum kicks us out?
So do you have a therapist of your own?
I've been feeling down in the mouth lately.
Do you know your socks don't match?
How can you say that I’m a people pleaser when you’re the one kissing my ass?
I can’t get no satisfaction. I’m not sure why I just said it like that.
The upper lip is stiff but the lower lip is incredibly soft.
If you ask me, you’re the one with the oral fixation.
Somehow you've helped me realize I like having my butt kissed.
May I Dali here a while?
Would you think less of me if I rolled onto my stomach ?
The mirrors on the ceiling are actually a bit distracting.
Is your decorator also a patient?
Am I being paranoid, or is this because last session I told you to kiss my ass?
Dr. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Whenever I come here, I have this feeling I can only describe as 'down in the mouth'!
I feel like a slip of the tongue.
Have you considered the possibility that it's you who has the oral fixation, doc?
Is this some sort of kiss and tell?
Did you lose a bet?
I really don't feel comfortable talking about my mother on this thing.
Mick Jagger was your patient??
I wouldn't say it's a midlife crisis, exactly. More like a mid-century modern crisis.
Yes, I am a little down in the mouth.
Am I comfortable?  I guess so, but honestly, I preferred your Womb Chair.
Well, I’m back because last week my wife found lipstick all over me.”
Doc, everything reminds me of her!
Are we into my dream or yours?
If you're chilly you can use the tongue as a blanket
Can we get the old couch back? I feel like a failed mustache.
The heat and vibration are nice. Could you turn down the salivation?
I feel consumed
So...I'm assuming your ex-wife took the leather couch?
Yes, I want to fuck the couch. Stop asking.
I'm feeling, well, a little chapped.
It’s okay, but I liked the breast-shaped one better.
Something's been eating at me.
I Can't Get No Satisfaction. But I try, and I try, and I try, and I try.
I can't help but feel like you're just giving me lip service, Doc.
I thought they were called Freudian slips.
And you say I have an oral fixation?
I feel like I’m in a Salvador Dali painting.
I don’t know, Doc. It’s just this feeling that I’m being eaten alive.
How much for the couch?
Yes, your sofa reminds me of sex, but so does almost everything.
I think you may be the one with the fetish, doc.
I'm not really comfortable saying the first thing that comes to mind. Can we go back to the ink blots?
Just curious.  What percentage of your patients do you diagnose as having an oral fixation?
I can't shake this overwhelming feeling of being consumed.
I can’t go home with lipstick on my collar again.
This is kind of like "kiss and tell.'
Nice shoes.
For 200 bucks an hour I was expecting more than lip service.
Sorry, I share my office with a plastic surgeon.
Are you sure it's me that has the oral fixation?
I have to say, it's more comfortable than the stack of soup cans.
I'm thinking that using a Groupon for therapy was questionable...
When you said to open up, were you talking to me or the couch?
Where'd you get the Freudian lips?
I just feel like I'm being swallowed up
I have the sensation that I am going to be swallowed up by my emotions
Do you have a couch for every fixation?
It's not that I feel like I'm being swallowed up as much as being spit out.
Sometimes I think lying is the only thing these lips are good for...
My other psychiatrist had a vagina couch...
I dont know how to say it, it's on the tip of my tongue.
I keep having this recurring dream that I'm about to get swallowed whole
I feel like a cold sore...
Thanks for letting me bring my own couch.
Do you know what's eating me?
Just between you and me Doc ... your couch sucks.
Did your couch just say “feed me, Seymour”?
I feel like I'm putting words into your mouth
So what kind of couch do you have for patients with an anal fixation?
How am I feeling? I'm feeling glad I didn't come here for help with an anal fixation.
Somehow it feels like I'm just getting lip service...
Freud would have a field day with this couch.
Can you just gloss over that last part?
I'm wondering, could you leave me and your couch alone for awhile?
So... what do your anally fixated patients sit on?
I’m a little nervous about what props you’ll be using when I progress to the next stage.
If I get lipstick on my shirt you’re explaining it to my wife.
I keep having Jumpin' Jack Flashbacks.
I just don’t get the symbolism, Dr. Lipman.
This beats my treatment for anal fixation.
With the amount you charge me per hour, THIS is the couch you decided to buy?
I feel as if I am being swallowed alive
Do you ever get the feeling that everyone is just kissing your ass?
This is actually the same shade of lipstick my mother was wearing the day she went out for mustard and never came back.
You think *I* have an oral fixation?
Yes, it does feel relieving to finally have MY butt kissed.
A new Freudian "slip" cover, Doc?
Honestly, I come here not to have my ass kissed.
I know when I’m licked.
You're telling me that sometimes a couch is just a couch?
I'm not making much progress on my fixation but I'm learning a lot about yours.
My other personality is asking if it comes in turquoise.
You should see what my proctologist makes me sit on!
Not everything is due to an oral fixation, you know."
I liked the vagina.
And you're sure these lips are sealed?
In the name of fairness, shouldn’t you be sitting on a pile of money?
I feel like a tongue.
Ironically, that’s when I told her she could kiss my ass.
I know it's only a couch but I still feel guilty.
I can't always get what I want.
Thanks Bill. This new couch is the most affection I've felt in a while.
I feel like a cigarette,  mind if I smoke?
I hope I don’t come across too tongue-in-cheek.
Am I glossing over something?
Can we move on to my foot fetish?
So sometimes it’s just a love seat?
I don't care if it's iconic...it's uncomfortable!
My life seems a bit surreal these days
And thanks again for letting me bring my own couch.
How do I explain the lipstick to my wife?
The Freudian lip's a nice touch.
I hope this shade is smudge proof because my wife does not know that I am seeing you.
And, where do you think it comes from, this fear of being eaten?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
By the way, you got a breath mint?
I think I know why you’re losing clients.
Is the couch free Saturday night?
I feel like a large Tootsie Roll in the mouth of life.
You're not going to believe this, but Mick Jagger has the same issue.
Are you sure I'M the one with the oral fixation?
You seem a bit down in the mouth again, Trevor. Tell me, what’s eating at you?
You asked Alexa to find a loveseat, didn't you?
Do you call this talk therapy or lip service?”
I can't relax......I keep wondering where the teeth are......
This really isn't helping with my mommy issues.
I’m feeling oddly aroused right now.
You know, Doc, without any shame, I do feel more comfortable with people kissing my ass.
My father was a rolling stone.
I've never noticed how drab your chair is.
Still working on your erotic novel?
I don't understand. You say you're a Jungian, but your couch is a Freudian?
I always feel like I'm in a Cartoon in the New Yorker!
I feel like I'm being consumed by my wife!
Despite it all, I'm trying to keep a stiff upper lip.
My other analyst saw everything in black and white.
Do you have anything YOU need to share, Doctor?
You think all of my problems are really just oral fixations.
Doc, I gotta tell you. It’d make you look a lot better if you just lost the lip shtick.
Sometimes a couch is just a couch...but not this time.
Remind me how this will help me get over my oral fixation?
My ear is being reupholstered.
It's shaped that way because I only offer lip service.
I can't get Mick Jagger out of my mind.
Thanks, but I still don't feel loved.
My mother wore this shade.
Have you noticed we're not in color?
Some chapstick would be nice.
What exactly do you mean by “Freudian lip?”
Really? This is the couch you use to treat my Oedipus complex?
Sometime I feel like Im just paying for lip service.
Right, Freudian Lip. Good one.
Really, I think I just need a hug.
So Doc, you really think this will cure my lisp.
I'm tired of paying for lip service.
Does it bite?
...and I'd like a moment alone with your couch?
Not a tremendous amount of lumbar support but a collagen injection should firm it up.
What do you mean, “you can’t always get what you want”?
does it vibrate?
She had the most luscious lips, and everything I see reminds me of them.
And I'M the one in the closet?
I'm only comfortable when someone's kissing my ass.
I feel like I’m stuck on first base.
If this couch could talk...
How does it feel? Like a Rolling Stone.
I’ve always had Dada issues.
I'm starting to think that my real problem is this couch.
It was on sale.
No matter how you couch it, it's really just lip service.
I asked you to help me be a chap who sticks to his guns, not a chap stick that sits on some gums
So, what stage do we cover on the brown sofa?
Fellatio comes to mind.
Me and my big mouth, doctor...
I don't know, I always just feel like I'm so close to the kiss of death.
Mind if I give you some advice this time?"
Did I ever tell you about my fear of clowns?
And, inexplicably, I'm terrified of clowns.
Do you find it odd that we’re both in black and white?
For some reason I keep thinking of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
It's a little creepy that it's the same color as my mother's lip stick.
I see you enjoyed my garage sale last weekend.
So what's with the Freudian slipcover?
Doc, I see her lips everywhere
Now this is lip service
When I told you last week to kiss my ass, I meant it figuratively!
I know, but sometimes a couch is just a couch...
Your couch is chapped.
I can't shake the feeling you're just paying lip service to my problems.
Before we begin...can I borrow a breath mint?
And then she told me I was objectifying her!  Where do women come up with this crap?
Do you have any breath mints...?!
Are those new shoes?
Maybe you’re the one with the oral fixation.
It's eating me up, doc.
What's harder, listening or trying not to laugh?
This is like the fourth Freudian analysis cartoon that the New Yorker crew has selected in the past six months. I think they must have issues.
I feel like something’s gnawing at me, Doctor.”
I just can't seem to shake my oral fixation.
Everything I see reminds me of her.
Of course I'm frustrated.  All you ever answer is 'what store do YOU think the couch came from'?
So, how do you treat the other fixations?
Everywhere I turn I'm reminded of her.
I had the Rocky Horror Movie dream again.
Seems I'm not the only one who can't resist a sale!
I know that I came here to talk about my problems, but perhaps you have some issues that you'd like to discuss with someone?
Your couch just told me I can't always get what I want.
Having my ass kissed is why I'm here in the first place.
I feel like I'm surrounded by ass-kissers.
Big Rolling Stones fan?
I have to tell you, Doctor, it has become increasingly difficult to discuss my mother since you got the new couch.
I have this reoccurring dream that I'm being swallowed.
...so I told her, I've had about all the lip I'm gonna take around here, and she said I should come and talk to you...
My advice to you, Doc-stay away from garage sales.
Have you considered a Freudian slip cover?
Are you sure it's me who has the oral fixation here?
Thank you for seeing me, Dr. Revlon.
At a garage sale? I hope you had it cleaned.
My preference is a therapist that’s all EARS
Very comfortable, is it old Freudian or early Heidi Fleiss?
I'm sorry, Doctor! But I just keep thinking, "Loose lips sink ships."
This is much more comfortable than the mustache.
I'm relieved it's not the French edition.
Kiss off !
You sure my insurance doesn't cover the leather couch?
What shape of couch do the women lay on?
I said “sweetheart, your lips look like my shrinks couch” ....Then she walked out on me.
Can you speak up? I’m not a lip reader.
Doc, I need more than just lip service.
Do you think I'll be ready for the labia in a few sessions?
Does this sofa open up?
I understand that this is couples' counseling to explore our relationship. Just wondering what my wife sits on. . .
I feel as if I've glossed over a few issues.
I just think it kind of says, "Kiss my ass."
I feel like when I'm here, I get something my wife never gives me.
My mother used a different color
Are  you sure this is going to help my oral fixation?
It seems firmer than last time.  Did you add Botox?
I had you pegged as more of a Beatles guy.
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey 
That's what I say
And this time try not to gloss over it.
Sometimes a couch is not just a couch.
I’m feeling a little down in the mouth
O k, read my lips!
I used to sit in that same chair.
Is that a tongue I feel?
I would return it and get the sectional.
I don't think I can say anything about my wife. I already feel like she's talked to you.
Where'd you get that chair?
Is it an edible complex?
Frankly, I like the Beatles more.
I don't know, Doc., I'm just feeling a little down in the mouth.
A whole body blow job! Thank you, Doctor!
It’s Mrs. Potato Head. She’s all I think about.
If this couch could talk, what would it say?
Actually, I more of a Beatles fan.
You don’t happen to have a giant half smoked cigarette we can dangle out of this couch.  It would make it so much easier to talk about my mother.
I feel pouty.
How about $75 an hour and I’ll reupholster this couch in earth tones?
I understand your couch is designed to look like lips, but why is it moist?
I’ve always liked having my ass kissed.
Do you mind if I lie on my stomach?
I feel like your choice of this sofa is a cry for help.
Is this where you say “Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar”?
I was joking when I said, "Bite me!"
It gives me comfort to know you're a Stones fan too.
How much longer 'til we arrive at the genital stage, Doc?
To be perfectly honest, this is the most aroused I've felt in months."
Recently, it feels like the world might chew me up and spit me out.
To be honest, Doc, I'm not sure this "Emoji Immersion Therapy" is working for me....
I just can't seem to get me no ... well ... satisfaction.
Now I get why it’s called  ‘kiss and tell.’
What happened to the high-heel chair?
Since I have become CEO, I feel like everyone is kissing up to me.
I don't know why, Doc, but it's only during our sessions that I feel the need to wear a garter belt, mesh stockings and very high heels.
Doc, a stiff upper lip just isn'
t a cure-all.
Yes, L- I-P-S-C-H-I-T-Z!
Read my lips. No more psychoanalysis.
I've been thinking about growing a moustache.
Did you say 'Freudian slips', or 'Freudian's lips'?
Give it to me straight, Doc.  No lip service.
This isn’t helping my fear of intimacy.
Is it possible YOU'RE the one with the oral fixation?
I dunno doc, but sometimes I think you want me to make everything about sex, even if it isn't. Is this a new couch?
Do you mind if i have a few minutes alone?
Are you really listening or just kissing my butt?
So Mick Jagger is your patient too? Does he get more satisfaction than I?
You can put lipstick on a sofa,Dr. Dali,but it's still a couch
I expect more than lip service.
I feel guilty as hell for not taking off my dirty shoes.
Do loose lips comfort Freudian slips?
Don't get me wrong, it's been nice talking to you but how did you get in my house again?
Sometimes a giant red lips couch is just a giant red lips couch.
And I have a recurring dream that I am being eaten by Mick Jagger.
Perhaps I should be asking the questions.
Just to recap, a moment on the lips is going to cost me what exactly?
Suddenly I feel loved for the first time
I've got an overwhelming urge to masticate.  Is that normal?
Tell Donald my lips are sealed
What do you mean that I am obsessed with sex.  It’s your couch!
Doc I'm having these recurring dreams about being the subject of some dumb-ass cartoonist!
As a matter of fact, my mother did wear this shade of red.
Does the anal stage have a couch too
In my line of work we call this 'leading the witness'.
Doc, I feel like a harmonica.
Do you mind if I speak to your couch alone?
This is my 19th nervous breakdown.
Life sometimes feels like a gentle kiss but mostly it sucks
My Mother had the same couch.
She says I put words in her mouth.
There is some mistake.  I was referred here for the red carpet treatment
I can handle the couch, but not the tongue.
So what exactly is an oral fixation?
For some reason, I keep thinking of Holland.
Yes, I am quite uncomfortable, thank you.
I think we should switch places.
What do you mean, "I'll feel better in a lick"?
Is there an actual name for the irrational fear of being suffocated by Lady Gaga's lips?
Have you considered therapy?
What's eating at me?
Let me guess, oral fetish?
As your Therapist, I work much better when I'm lying down....
A kiss on the cheeks was just what I needed.
My inner adolescent likes it. But my inner child wants a racing car.
Why do I feel I'm only getting lip service?
This isn't what I had in mind when you said 'immersion therapy.'
Is it weird to be aroused during therapy?
Just about everything I see reminds me of her.
Who else shares this office?
You think I’VE got an oral fixation.
My life seems to be one Freudian's lips after another.
A kiss is just a kiss, but this is ridiculous.
I can't get no satisfaction, Doc.
Lately, I feel like I’m on everyone’s lips.
I like this new red Freudian lipcover, uh, slipcover.
I was told you could cure a fixation on breasts.
You mean, sometimes a couch is just a couch?
I keep putting my foot in my mouth.
Will these lips move if I lie?
This is the weirdest interview I’ve ever had
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
By the way, your couch sucks.
I always feel I'm getting the big kiss off.
Just whose oral fixation are we discussing here?
How long will you be filling in for Dr. Frankenfurter?
I see a red couch and I want to paint it black.
Did you Botox your couch?
What do you mean - down in the mouth?
I still see her ruby red lips everywhere.
Actually this is a furniture store
The first word coming to my mind is, "Houlihan."
What do you mean, lip service?
No, really. This is much more comfortable than the chattering teeth.
Well, what about YOUR oral fixation?
No therapeutic purpose actually, just a crazy bargain at a garage sale.
So you really think I am orally fixated?
Sometimes I dream that I'm a cold sore.
Is there meant to be saliva on this couch?
Where did you say you went to school again?
How did I find you? Well, word of mouth, I guess...
Do you find people open up more now?
Oops, I shouldn't have said that. Me and my big mouth.
Would you like to talk about your oral fixation, Doctor?
I fear the Apocalips is coming.
I keep having this dream where I'm trapped in IKEA.
Ooooh!  It’s got a tongue!
Does this couch fold out, by any chance?
Is a couch sometimes just a couch?
I feel like you're trying to tell me something.
Can you give me an hourly rate with just your couch?
I'm so tired of all the ass-kissing.
I feel like I’m stuck in a New Yorker caption contest cartoon that frankly is just not very funny.
Is this one of those times when a sofa is just a sofa?
Sometimes my life just feels like an actual New Yorker cartoon.
Doc, can you get a more depressing couch?

I don't know exactly.  Something is just eating at me.
I'm glad you got rid of the Venus Fly Trap.
I'm sure I would do better on a couch that doesn't remind me of my mother.

I'm not looking forward to the anal retentive couch.
Then she swallows me whole and I wake up screaming.
Your Yelp reviews raved about the couch.
I appreciate a good yard sale bargain as much as the next guy but...
And I’m the one with the oral fixation?
My crisis as a corporate mouthpiece is materializing in ways I never thought possible - I see loose lips everywhere
Love the Freudian Lips, by the way.
Yes, I'm color blind.  Why do you ask?
You’re not a Rolling Stones fan are you?
For some reason, this couch speaks to me.
Given my issues with women, should I be on this one?
Everywhere I look, something reminds me of her.
Yes, this is already not helping.
Restoration Freudware
It was obvious to everyone but me... papa was a rolling stone.
I have this fantasy about oral sex, Doc ....
I know I failed the ink blots, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got this one.
What do you mean, 'Spit it out?"'
Mother/Dali complex, eh?
Did your couch just whisper, "Feed me..."?
I've tried to tell you before Doc. I'm stuck in the anal stage, not oral.
Sorry, my lips are sealed
I have recurring dreams of being swallowed.
Mick sent me.
Hmmm... your mother gave you this couch? Go on please.

It's like I see parts of her everywhere I go."
Why, yes, Papa was a Rolling Stone.
Doc, I need real answers, not just lip service.
Loose Lips Sink Shrinks
I'm not sure why but ever since I've begun therapy here I've wanted people to kiss my ass.
I feel surprisingly comfortable opening up to you.
Doc, my wife's gonna kill me when she sees the back of this suit.
Let me guess. You're a Freudian therapist.
So far all I've gotten from you is lip service.
Yes, I know I'm orally fixated.
It's getting harder to explain the lipstick on my collar.
What comes after the oral phase, again?
Come on, you're a psychologist; this couch has to remind you of something.
**
.
Actually, I'm thinking you might be the one with the oral fixation.
I'd like you to imagine that *you* are the cigarette.
I hope my wife doesn't notice the lipstick.
Lately, I've been having nightmares about being eaten alive by Mick Jagger.
How do I know you're not just giving lip service, doctor?
This has been a real breakthrough for the "Oral" stage, but I'm a bit concerned about your furniture in the next room.
Did you say it was probably a Freudian's lip?
My apologies if I misspoke when I laid down, Doctor. It must've been a...Freudian Lip.
Do you hear whispers ?
All the life is being sucked out of me.
I've been feeling a little down in the mouth.
I've been a little down in the mouth lately.
I keep glossing over details.

Can’t you just read my lips?
I'm not sure why, but I come here and always feel like singing happy birthday Mr. president.
I’ll give you a hint:  the elephant in the room is not an elephant.

I made a Freudian lips.
I know you said to expect side effects, but I'm beginning to feel like I should have gone with the blue pill.
From my lips to your ears
Things just aren't as black and white as they used to be, doc.
Really? MY oral fixation?
It's just on the tip of the tongue.
Why do you think all of your patients are orally fixated?
Since coming here I've had nightmares about being eaten by a giant version of my mother.
I guess this means it's time to confront my oral fixation?
'I am telling you, Doctor, this sucks.
It feels like I’m just lip-syncing.
Maybe you should work through your own oral fixation first Doctor.
I’m at a Freudian crossroads between Chapstick and dental floss.
Tomorrow night we do my fantasy, Dear.
I was told that I would be speaking with Dr. Jagger...

My wife is complaining about the lipstick stains."
But, enough about me...
I should've been a tongue depressor.
I have this recurring dream that I'm being swallowed by a femme fatale."
No offense, but I’m not the only one in the room stuck in the seventies...
Just one quick question-I’m not paying you for lip service am I?
Doc, do you ever feel like telling the whole world to just kiss off?
No, I don't feel love.  I feel like I'm being tasted.
Now, regarding your oral fixation...
Lately, I just cain’t get no satisfaction!
Something’s eating me, doc, but I don’t know exactly what.
I have the feeling I’m about to be eaten alive, doc. But I only feel that way here in your office.
Sure you can help me with my fear of saying 'no' to interior decorators?
I have this nagging fear I'm about to be swallowed up.

This gives "From my lips to your ears" a new meaning
I feel like a smoke.
I often feel like the world just wants to spit me out.
Today I'm letting the couch do the talking.
Doctor, this is just plain wrong.
These lips don’t lie!
I'm been having recurring fantasies of Carol Channing.
Is it supposed to be moist?
If I remember tripping while lying on one of these back in the 60s does it mean I didn't?
So this is what it feels like to have your ass kissed.
You’re not listening. Father called me “dipstick,” not “lipstick.”
I just can't get no satisfaction.
Yes, doctor, but now instead of my stepmother, I keep dreaming of Tim Curry.
Can I adjust this tongue cushion?
I come here, I feel like I could finally just tell her to kiss my ass.
I feel like everyone is giving me lip service....

What does your hot tub look like?
Perhaps you have a racy little pillow for my shoes?”
I’m on the tip of its tongue
When can we talk about my own fixation?
All I hear is blah, blah, blah...
..:and sometimes I come to rest on other exaggerated parts of her body.
Can we go back to the ink blots? My pants are soaked.
It makes me feel like I'm being devoured, but in a good way.
Fears of being devoured follow me everywhere.
This sucks.
Doctor, every slip of the lips doesn't need to be couched in Freudian terms.
Your office decor isn't helping my oral fixation.
I can see her everywhere.
Well yes, I have been to quite a few Rolling Stones concerts. Why do you ask?
What's love got to do with it?
Is this for real or am I  just paying for lip service?
See, and my wife won’t even let me keep the leg lamp.
Yes, I definitely feel more loved now.
I'm telling you again, the signal was as green as this couch!

Actually, I think it’s this couch that’s helping me, not you!
So, on Mondays, we deal with my oral fixation and on Thursdays we deal with my anal retentiveness?
You’ve got to stop showing up every time I lie down on this couch!
To be completely frank, this may not be the most conducive environment to break my sex addiction.
I totally relate. My mother also wore red lipstick.
My mother never let me sit on her couch.
Why do I have the feeling you’re not the right therapist to help me get over my sex addiction?
Are these the ones that sank all the ships?
...and now there's this recurring nightmare about being devoured.
Would you recommend just keeping a stiff upper lip?
#metoo
Doc, whenever I'm here I feel like I'm being sucked in.
I don’t know what it is, but every time I visit your office I feel down in the mouth.
I’ve had the Edward Gorey color palette dream again.
...and by the way, smetimes a couch is NOT just a couch.
And how do you handle anal fixations?

No, I didn't notice anything different. Is that a new tie?
I'm not sure why, but I want to kiss your couch.
Do you use a different couch with your female patients?
I feel like  a couch tomato!
I fear that I'm paying extra for lip service.
I don't know, everything reminds me of  Angelina Jolie
Don't worry about confidentiality.  My lips are sealed.
Yes the lips are very comfortable, but what happened to the rest of her?
Lip service... interesting.
Do you have a blue couch for Democrats?
Your sofa likes me.
If only this couch could talk.
You're the one with the stiff upper lip.
I keep dreaming of melting watches.
I'm glad you don't think I'm anal.
Read my lips: I want Prozac.
Doc, am I your only patiennt stuck in the oral stage?
I had that dream again... the one about my mother's lipstick.
My one concern about beginning this process with you is the turtle neck...its a bit ostentatious.
I am suffering from a fear of being swallowed.
I'm looking for more than lip service, doc.
Never mind my oral fixation.... where can I get a love seat like this?

Doctor, I've heard of Freudian slips, but Freudian lips?!"
Are you sure you aren't an abnormal psychologist?
Judging by the couch, you don't do marriage counseling.
I feel like you just give me lip service.
Should I consider this a love seat?

Is smile therapy proven?
I'm not paying for lip service, doc.
I am haunted by guilt for not having first removed my shoes.
Unfortunately my lips are sealed
You’re kidding Doc; You’ve really never noticed
I said, “Read my lips.”
We'll definitely need another session if this couch reminds you of your mother...
From my lips to Freud's ears
You knew Salvador as well? He was fun, wasn't he.
I feel insignificant...like a speck of food about to be wiped away by a giant napkin.
How many smackers will this session set me back?
Do you have anything for patients with an anal fixation?
My biggest issue today is why this couch is red and everything else is black and white.
Yes. It is the kiss of death.
What do you mean " start me up? "
I am very anxious about a slip of the tongue.
It's comfortable, but it's not my shade.

I don’t need therapy, I just like your couch.
So what kind of couch should I expect for “second base” therapy?
Everyone thinks I'm a sucker.
It all started with her big mouth!
What couch?

I'd rather not answer questions about my mother on this couch.
I'm starting to think you're the one with the oral fixation.
I thought this part of the story stayed in Vegas.
'I remember when your office was a brothel.'
I'm getting mixed messages from my ex-wife, my new girlfriend and now this couch
Each time I leave here, I feel there's something that I should tell her.
It’s actually comfortable, but is it meant to remind me that I am loved, or that I’m about to be consumed by my issues?
I think I feel a tongue...
I suddenly have a compulsive need to use Chapstick.
You know, sometimes a couch is just a couch.
Read my lips: I have issues.
My speech writing career topped out with 'Read my lips.'
Even here I feel like she's swallowing me whole.
Dr Lipschitz why do I suddenly feel like everything in my life is surreal
I didn't realize we both had oral fixations.
Doc, I feel you place to much emphasis on the oral phase.
I had the most distressing cold sore on my shoulder last week, do you think it's psychosomatic?
I thought the whole idea of coming here was to not to be down in the mouth.
I preferred the flamingo float toy for regression therapy
I must say, not everything about the '70s was bad.
What kind of couch do you use for the anal retentive?
Write this down. I don't like red.
I’m glad I didn’t confess to an anal fixation.
Lately in my nightmares, I'm smothered in mustard.
The dreams continue, Doc!  All my relationships appear monochromatic, but inanimate objects vibrate with vivid colors and shout out sexual symbolism... and I feel somehow that our therapy sessions are not helping.
It's on the tip of my tongue
I take it you want me to start talking more during our sessions?
And people think that I'm sick.
I ‘m not feeling the love.
I feel like we are just paying lip service to my issues.
Rocky Horror Show? Never heard of it.
Could I have a hug, too?
Wow, the brothel look has really taken over.
'Could you please make the lips quiver a bit?'
Must have been a good sale.
I don’t know, Doc... I’ve just been feeling... a little puckered out.
From these colorful and comfortable lips to God's ears.
As I've been telling you, not everything is black and white.
Doctor, I'm expecting results here, not just lip service.
Is this just lip service?
Do you think I'm still stuck in the oral stage?
I can't seem to stop thinking about the Kardashians.
For a therapist, you're quite literal.
This is why I don't like telling you about my dreams.
Is therapy the kiss of death?
Don't just give me lip service doc, tell me what's wrong with me.
Doctor--add oral fixation to the list . . .
Can you give me more than lip service?
Perhaps start with an oral history
It's weird, everywhere I go, it's like she's mocking me.
Does it make everyone talk more, or just me?
I feel like a misdangled cigarette
Why do I feel like this is all just lip service?
Do you have anything a little less oedipal?
I don’t have any problems, but can I pay for an extra hour?
Remind me, you said you share this space with a "Film" studio?"
I'm afraid our time is up. You can put your money where the mouth is on your way out.

You have no idea how comforting it is to have a mid-last century analyst.
I keep dreaming of floss
When I’d heard you were influenced by Dali, I’d assumed they meant Lama, Doctor.
Someone here is fixated, but I don't think it's me.
So if you feel I'm no longer trapped in the oral phase, why do I feel so comfortable here?
I just want to make sure - this is from my lips to your ears only, right?
Doctor, why can't I get no satisfaction?
A voice in my head keeps whispering, 'Feed me Seymour, feed me'.
Yeah, well, as your upholsterer, I think you need to take a long, hard look at these drapes.
I'm not one to kiss and tell.
Strangely, my fear of intimacy seems to be worse whenever I'm here with you.
Well it is more comfortable than the cigar couch

Does this couch make me look pale?

How many smackeroos will this run me?
Really? Or are you just giving me lip service?
Why yes, being in this position has been a fantasy of mine.
Delusion?   No I am Mick Jagger!
I don't think you can just kiss it and make it better
The love seat is pretty comfortable, though this seems an odd position to discuss my investment strategy in.
I do want more romance in my life, but isn’t this taking it too far?
No it is not my unconscious desire to be eaten. It really is shaped like a mouth.
Is it just me or is it a bit warm...moist...breathy...seductive...illegal...sinful in here?

So, Doctor, how long have you had this Marilyn Monroe fetish?
I know what you're thinking.
So Mick Jagger used to live here?
I can’t explain it, but for some reason I’m feeling down in the mouth.
Can I take my shoes off?
Of course, I appreciate confidentiality--but SEALED WITH A KISS?
I’ve heard Jagger used to be a patient of yours.
Tell me again, why is this called the Steven Tyler / Mick Jagger approach?
I keep thinking I smell cherry chapstick
Surrounding my Oedipis Complex with Surrealism really is not helping!
Maybe we should talk about YOUR mother.
I don't know, everything just reminds me of her lips
Sorry Doctor, was that a Freudian lip?
Sometimes I just feel like the world is about to open wide and swallow me whole, you know, doc?
I'm sorry, doctor.  I can't escape the feeling that I'm stuck in a Dali painting.
Do you ever feel like you are being swallowed by your emotions?
I can't help but think that you may not be best suited to cure me of my oral fixation.
So why do you think you can't sleep
I have this strange feeling you're just giving me lip service.
Hot lips Houlihan..i cant get her out of my mind

Wherever I go I see red lips.
We’re just trolling the readers of the New Yorker with yet another damned psychiatrist cartoon, aren’t we?
I have this weekly fear I'm gonna be eaten alive...
I have this constant feeling of being eaten alive.
And how would you define "oral fixation?"
I feel compelled to talk about my oral fixation.
Read my lips, I...Think...You...Suck.
You know, there’s something about this couch that makes me want to open up and talk more.
Dr, I'd be more comfortable letting the couch do my talking.
You’re not just giving me lip service, are you?
For some reason, as soon as I start talking to you, I feel like a cigarette.
I take it this room used to be the honeymoon suite?
I'm a lip reader, not a mind reader.
I always feel down in the mouth for some reason....
I FEEL like I'm just paying for lip service.
Pig on a lipstick
This isn't helping with my Mick Jagger obsession.
You bet I'm depressed. Why is my cartoon caption never selected?
I really feel down in the mouth, but I can’t say why.....
I just can't shake the feeling that my oral fixation only seems to rear its head when I am talking to you.
No, that was just the couch burping
I try and I try, but I just don’t seem able to get any satisfaction.
Doc! I can't stop thinking about the way she used to kiss me!
I love your new Boca office, Dr. Firth.

This is much better than your colon couch

Before we begin, I do agree that Psychoanalysis is a lip-service industry.
After our sessions are over, I just tell everyone to kiss off.
I wish you had gone more mid-century modern and less tap-into-my-deepest-anxieties.
Did you know my mother?
Is it normal to have a Freudian lip in your office?
Do you find that a love seat works better than a sofa?
Mind you , most of my fantasies are in black and white .

No, I don't kiss and tell.

Put me down for Frebruary 14th.
I'm not paying you to kiss my ass..
It's time to kiss mommy goodbye.
I appreciate that you never tell me to kiss off!
Yes, but the teeth.
If only this sofa could talk, eh Doc?
I know YOUR lips are sealed, but what about your couch?
Why, yes, as a matter of fact, Mummy DID wear bright red lipstick. Why?
So you're saying I may be merely paying lip service, instead of facing my problems.
Just read my lips, doc. I don’t
feel like talking today.
Perhaps I should be the one taking notes.
Can't wait to see the couch you use when I graduate from the oral phase!
Really, it's frustrating when all of the answers seem to be on the tip of my tongue.
Your new decor is not helping with my sex addiction.
Lip service?  Is that all I get for two-hundred-twenty-five dollars an hour?
Do you tell all your clients they’re stuck in the oral stage of development?
Well I guess when you credited yourself as the “Love Doctor”, I didn’t have this in mind

My wife’s going to know I’ve been at the therapist.

Sometimes I think I'm just a slip of the tongue to you.
Chapstick?

Can you couch this in terms I can understand?
At least it's not wet.
All you do is work, Phil. Come sit next to me.
When I’m here with you, for some reason, I just feel tongue tied.
I do tend to gloss over things.
I have problems with women. In fact, sometimes I feel like I'm being eaten alive
Sir,do you think I can have my chair back and start asking you the questions now?
Do you have something less,I don't know,moist?
My thoughts are blue, this couch is red- tell me now how to mend my head
I just feel like things have been eating me up"
I believe it's you who has the oral fixation, dear Doctor!
Run that by me again? You think I'M the one with an oral fixation?
I think I need more than lip service.
Wow, Doc. This sofa really says it all.
I feel you're only giving me lip service.
Then she kisses me with her big red lips and I wake up. What does it mean, Doc?
I need something more than your lip service.
The shape- the color -the hue!  All reminders of your lucious curvaceous wife.
Doctor, I think my oral fixation is getting worse, not better.
Hey Doc. Are you sure that oral fixation diagnosis is not just a projection?
This is an unorthodox way to cure my Philematophobia.
What I'm thinking?"  Loose lips sink ships
At first, it seemed like it would be tight-lipped. But it's actually quite comfortable.
You aren’t the “kiss and tell” type, are you?
Your pen is out of ink.
You're the oral fixation expert, what do you think?
Has this couch been tested for STDs?
Could I try the father issues couch next time?
Now, you tell me about your wife.
So far all I've got from you is a bunch of lip service.
To be honest, I feel like you’re just giving me lip service.
Have you read The Vagina Monologues?
I hope you got this on sale.
Read my lips no new issues !
I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable talking about my mother.
So you think I'm the one with the oral fixation?
Was your last patient crying? The pillow is wet
I like your new couch, doc. Any chance I can lay face down?"
Expensive lip service, Doc
I see what you're going for here, but my mother wore a different shade of lipstick.
I may have “glossed” over some of the most important parts.
You’re the one with the oral fixation.
Before I start, can we talk about you first.
I was referred to you by Mick Jagger.
My designer said it spoke to her
Why do I get the feeling that I'm only paying for lip service?
I feel so inadequate. I never win the New Yorker caption contests.
By the way, I like your company name: Kiss and Tell.
Does Revlon provide you with a stipend as well?
I'd like this session in a more serious shade."
I’ve heard you’re the best therapist in the Poconos
Why am I now experiencing a premonition that I going to be swallowed by Lady Gaga?
I can't escape the feeling that people are only giving me lip service.
For once I would like to be brutally honest with you - I hate the new couch.
It's the red; it just screams vanity and insincerity.
Redecorating to get this couch for your narcissistic patients was brilliant -they'll love getting their a** kissed.
‘Oral fixation’, you say?
Ok...but when you make the referral can you say ‘persnickety’ instead of  ‘obsessive’?
Getting back to my oral fixation...
It just all seems like lip service.
I just want to know.  Are those Freudian's lips
Your new couch makes me want to smoke some weed and blast some Stones tunes.
Add Dentophobia to the list.
From my lips to yours.
No more lip service, Please !
And then, Doctor, he said, 'If  we could prove the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.'
From God's mouth to your ear!
Sometimes doc, I feel like you are just giving me lip service.
I don’t have a problem.  I just love your couch.
Stiff upper lip and all that.
Kinda goes with the turtleneck
You can't always get what you want? That's your advice? Boy, Mick Jaggeran therapy sucks!
I feel lipstuck.
I was fine when we started now I'm feeling pouty.
By the way, I like the Freudian slip-covers
Oh, and you think I have Mommy issues!
Frankly, doctor, I was hoping for more than lip service.
You've certainly aroused my id but I'd prefer your super-ego couch.
Read my lips - no new lapses!
Can we agree to dispense with the same old lip service I've gotten from every other therapist?
I feel like my past is eating away at me.
Accused of an oral fixation, can you believe it?
I tell you Doc, I think I'm going crazy! Ever since she and I broke up, I imagine that I see her luscious red lips everywhere I go.
All I can think about is oral sex..
You know, you're fly is open.
‘I think you might be right doctor. I hadn’t thought if it before, but oral fixation makes sense...’
I’d like to move beyond your standard lip service.
You say Mick Jagger once owned this apartment?
Can you split the bill evenly between my personalities?"
I have this recurring dream of being swallowed.
So, I feel like a hotdog inside a tomato. Is there something wrong about that?
Do you have a King Kong sofa, Dr. B?
So you feel like you’re being swallowed, very interesting.
And now my wife won't speak to me.  Every week, I come home with all these smears in a shade that doesn't match hers.
Either this therapy sucks, or it's your couch.
You can't say I'm being "tongue in cheek" when there is literally, a tongue in my cheeks.
Well, it all started when I dreamed I was lying on a therapist's couch shaped like my mother's lips.
Do you think it could be an oral fixation?
I fear your lips are not sealed.
It's true, I've never been kissed.
I see you’re a Rolling Stones fan.
I feel like my fear of conversation is eating me alive.
I dreamt I was a giant ChapStick.
I can't get the words out of my mouth.
In my dream I’m naked, but wearing bright red lipstick.
You think it's a problem that your couch reminds me of my mother?
Flipping on the vibration will help with unpacking my childhood traumas.
Funny -- all these years I thought it was called Freudian Slip.
But isn't it an improvement from the last time, when I had the blues?
Analyze me like one of your French girls.
Doc, call me nuts--but I'm thinking the printer may have gotten a deal on red ink.
I never trust anyone with a turtle neck
Why did you give up marriage counseling?
Have you got any chapstick?
It's Dalian, not Freudian.
And then my mother said, "Don't give me any more of your lip!"
I keep looking for love in all the wrong places.
I keep seeing a big long red tie; what does it mean.
Nope... still uncomfortable
Sorry, but as a Marriage Therapist, I only have a love seat.
Time´s up, next week: Vagina!
Is this couch going to leave a stain? That's how I got in trouble the first time.
You're not just offering me lip service, are you?
Exactly whose mother are we talking about?
At least your lip service is covered by my insurance.
I don’t know, for some reason I can’t get the words out.
An oral fixation.  How so?
I can’t help but get the impression that you are biased when you say that I am stuck in the oral stage
A little Barry White should do the trick.
Doc, I need help. I can't figure out my sleep number.
First off, I would like to thank you for making yourself available for this parent teacher conference.
Is everything about sex?
Any idea why I only feel down in the mouth when I come here, Doc?
Reverse psychology, no?
Did I tell you that's a lovely jacket you have on.
I feel so...loved.
Each week I feel you’re only giving me lip service
No, I'm not reminded of my mother.
My therapy here has taught me it’s not all black and white.
Quit kissing my ass, Doc.
I should have beleived them when they said you would kiss it and make it better.
I know you’re a love doctor, but this couch is a little much, no?
Still no satisfaction.
For some reason, I keep thinking of Major Houlihan.
I heard you specialize in oral fixations
I keep thinking I see Mick Jagger everywhere.
This won't smudge my suit, will it?
I feel like she's always there.
I put a rest to lip service.
How much if I use last season’s couch?
I like this new couch, the old one was getting chapped.
I feel uncomfortable telling you this, Dr. Lipschitz.
She seems to be consuming me.
Now that we've switched places, tell me what your problem is.
Pucker-punched. The new hypnosis.
I'd be lying , doctor, if I told you I didn't come back for the lips.
So, what am I paying for this lip-service ?
I keep having the sensation that I'm being swallowed alive.
I can't help but feel you're paying me lip service.
Tell me more about your Dali-ence.
I have no direction home. Like a Rolling Stone.
Is that you smacking your lips?
A kiss is still a kiss,  but sometimes a couch is just a couch.
I didn't start with an oral fixation, but I think I have one now.
This is wet
I'm not really listening as you've only paid for lip service
Why do you always diagnose me with an oral fixation?
Did you steal this couch from the Dali museum?
At times I sense that she's consuming me.
After every session with you, I have nightmares about Mick Jagger.
My problem is that I keep hearing voices.
At last...wish fulfillment!
I keep dreaming that Mae West keeps inviting me upstairs
I assure you, this is much more comfortable than what my anally fixated patients get to lie on.
You just giving me lip service?
Sometimes I think you are just playing lip service to my problems.
My insurance covers this right?
Do you really think this is the best way to approach my need for oral gratification?
You think this is an appropriate couch for sex therapists ?
My phobias have diminished but I have started having nightmares of being eaten by Mick Jagger.
How odd that right now I can vividly remember my mom's lipstick.
Death is not the end.
Are all your patients obsessed with sex?
It's like you're just giving lip service.
I see you installed ceiling mirrors.
Remember... from your lips to Gods ears...
Why, yes, my mother did wear red a lot.
I keep dreaming that I'm being eaten by the Cheshire Cat.
Not sure if you're writing notes or just drawing me.
Sometime's I feel like I'm just a cigar.
So, tell me. What's biting you?
Gene Simmons recommended you
I feel like I’m never taken seriously.
Would you like to talk about your couch choice?
Love is all around me but I can't find it.
This is not helping my germaphobia, doc. I have no idea where these lips have been.
The problem is there is no right on red.
Can I sleep here tonite ?
I’m just so fucking bald. Look how bald I am. So fucking bald. Easy for you to tell me what to do. You’ve got a great fucking head of hair. Fuck. Look at me. I’m fucking bald. So goddamn bald. BALD. Bald bald bald bald. Nice couch, by the way.
A stiff upper lip?
Yes, it’s bothering me!
I fantasize about her eating me alive!!!
Best one hundred bucks an hour job ever!!!!!
I think I’ve developed an oral fixation.
I have this recurring nightmare that loose lips sink ships.
I'm sorry, but I feel you're just giving me lip service.
Doc, it's my big mouth again
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love.
I feel like I’m about to be eaten. I can’t explain it.
I do wish you’d stop referring to everything I say on this couch as Freudian lips.
Mick referred me. Said he was satisfied with your treatment.
Your CV says you specialize in patients with an oral fixation.
But I feel blue
Sometimes it’s almost like I sexualize furniture.
No, Doc.  Not red behind.  I said, "You've read my mind, read my mind."
Do YOU have a Fetish?
Do you validate parking
It feels good, but I'm worried about the teeth.
It’s funny Doc, I’m beginning to feel like I just might be able to love again.
Maybe it's just me, but lately it seems like I'm getting a lot of lip from everybody.
A little more of my story and you'll really see why my life sucks.
It feels chapped.
I can't help feeling down in the mouth.
So you're sure that the lips are sealed?
Very comfortable. But it's missing teeth. Does that mean anything, Doctor?
And you thought the turtleneck was tacky.
I feel I'm on everybody's lips.
Philemaphobia exposure therapy
What is the couch for a woman?
I have this irrational fear of being eaten alive.
The oral stage of development?
I have this persistent sensation of being eaten alive.
It is right on my tongue.
Can we cancel till you get a blue couch?
Why do I feel you’re just giving me lip service?
I just can't get past the oral stage.
After a year of therapy, why haven't I gotten past this oral fixation, doc?
I’m just paying for lip service, right?
Dang it! I never should have told you that, I have such a big mouth!
I feel damp!
And then it turns out to just be a pistol in my pocket after all.
Maybe I shouldn’t have told you about the herpes.
You call it oral fixation, I call it comfy.
Maybe I've been glossing over my problems.
Don't put SWAK on my 'script. It creeps my pharmacy out.
Are you sure there are no teeth?
Listen, you can tell me anything. My lips are sealed.
It feels like I'm down in the mouth.
MAE we please stop DALIing around?
Is this because of the "lip service" comment I made last week?
Very interesting.  Now, why do you think you are having this reoccurring nightmare about being eaten alive by a woman wearing bright red lipstick?
Is there an obvious metaphor here, or is it all in my mind?
No, I don't think I have an oral fixation. I think I know myself a bit better than that. Nice couch by the way."
Yes, my Mother did wear bright red lipstick. Why do you ask?
So then I dreamed I was being swallowed by a giant pair of lips.
So I followed your advice and told them all to kiss off!
I invented the Wax Moustache, Wax Teeth, Wax Vampire Fangs, but I've hit a creative block...
I dunno, doc… It’s, well, it’s like I’m being swallowed in kitsch.
Once on the lips, forever on the hips.
When I said 'I feel unloved', I was expecting a more conversational solution.
Lip Synching, Couch Surfing....you’ve advised me to free associate
This is the couch we use for oral fixations. Be grateful you weren't diagnosed with anal personality.
Doc, my oral fixation's eating me alive.
I knew I would feel comfortable talking to you.
Is this why you call it Houlihan's Syndrome?
You look uptight. How about you lie down and I take the notes.
What happened to your peacock lounger?
This is the Breast--I mean best, sofa I've ever been on, Dr. Freud.
Are these lips sealed, Doc?
I don't feel I'm making any progress when I come to see you, doctor. I keep feeling you're just giving me lip service.
I keep having dreams of Carol Channing.
You say your mother wore red lipstick?
Doc, it's times like these that I feel like a... well, like a dick.
Well not everything reminds me of my mother.
How's the sketch coming along?
I’ll tell you about my mother, but first peel me a grape.
I mean it just seems surreal, don’t you think?
I’m thinking about what a red couch means.
The problem's on the tip of my tongue
I keep having this repetitive dream that I'm being eaten alive by Kim Kardashian.
I'm going deep in the red.
A moment on the lips.
Tell me about your oral fixation, Doctor.
It's her lips, I can't stop thinking about her lips.
The first thing I notice about a woman is her smile.
Maybe I'm paranoid but I feel like I'm being swallowed by Taylor Swift.
I’m afraid lip service will not help you.
Is the lipstick colorfast?
I’m not the only one seeing this, right?
I have this recurring dream of being eaten alive and frankly this couch is not helping.
I've developed a fetish for big, bright red lips.  I'm obsessed. 
 Even in this present moment it's all I can think about.
The couch? It's a Freudian lip.
This isn't the kind of intimate session I was hoping for.
Believe it or not, but I am not a lip reader
I’m reminded of her red lips wherever I go.
My mother always wore red lipstick.
DOC, something is gnawing on me.
I think we can leave your couch fixation for the next session
I can't help thinking I'm just paying for lip service.
Still feeling tight-lipped?
Um...uh...it's on the tip of my tongue...
I would've gone with something closer to magenta.
And just how does one become an oral fixation specialist?
Can you tell me what exactly is it about the couch that reminds you of your ex?
It is complex, I feel as though I am about to be simultaneously loved and eaten.
Do you think this makes me look hot?
You know, I've always wanted to buy this couch from Design Within Reach but I'm glad you did because, honestly, it's not that comfortable and it wouldn't pair well with the rest of my living room. Anyway, I still don't know why my children hate me.
Gift from Mick?
Do you mean that sincerely or are you just paying lip service?
I think I'm falling in love with this couch.
Listen Doc, read my lips, it’s not an oral fixation.
I’ve got moods like Jagger.
I'm suddenly tongue-tied
I can't shake this feeling that someone is licking my behind.
Sometimes everyday objects remind me of her. Does that ever happen to you Doc?
Am I being too tongue-in-cheek?
...and that was the beginning of my oral fixation.
And I thought I had a problem before.
I have Dali issues.
Hey Doc, remember Major Holihan from Mash?
Nope, sorry, I'm not feeling it.
Thank you for accommodating my fantasies...
Every time I come here I think I am on the cover of a rolling Stones album.
I can't let it go - I feel like it's eating me up
You know there's an app for that?
So, are you Freudian or Jungian?
Do you ever feel like life really has you in its jaws?
This sofa reeks of bad breath.
I think it all goes back to my father, Mae he West in peace...
Am I supposed to listen to it or can I talk?
What's love have to do with it?
What do you mean that “your lips are sealed”?
I feel like you are only giving me lip service.
Is this what you mean by "lip service"?
Is our time up?  Your clock melted.
Doc, I have a persistent nightmare that Donald Trump is president.  Am I psychotic?
Just checking to be sure you're still listening to me and that you're not texting your mother again
This is nice, but I'd be more comfortable with Dada.
So you're telling me to stop seeing everything in black and white? Very subtle.
I'm finding the oral stage very comfortable.
I'm confused.  Who's paying lip service here?
I think it’s time we discuss YOUR mommy issues.
Yes, lot's of people kiss up to me. Why do you ask?
Ok, I think I’m ready to share my oral history.
As soon I saw it was Contest #666, I came to see you, my priest was busy.
Doc, I'm beginning to think maybe it's you who has the oral fixation.
Thank you for paying lip service to my problems.
Your lips are very soft.
It's strange, but ever since I started seeing you, I have these recurring nightmares about someone trying to eat me.
Are you sure that I am the one with the oral fixation, Doc?
Oh, what would you know about male pattern baldness.
I seem to look for love in all the wrong places.
It’s my professional opinion John that you have been a CEO so long you expect everyone to kiss your ass
I have this feeling of floss.
I feel seduced by your treatments.
I now feel in a good position to tell you about my casting-couch reputation...
What do you mean by your lips are sealed?
I hear you're a lip reader.
Would this float?
For some reason, I'm feeling a bit more down in the mouth at the moment.
You realize this couch isn't helping my oral fixation?
Well it's more comfortable than the catcher's mitt, I'll give you that...
How does it make me feel? Like a couch tomato, I guess.
With this couch, don't you dare tell me you're a Freudian "
I can't find the word for my problem, but it's on the tip of my lips.
In my dream, the only way I could communicate was by lip synching.
It's just that I know you're a Freudian...so yeah...the new couch makes me a little uncomfortable.
Are you sure you're a dentist?
It’s Mid-century Modern, not midlife crisis.
Was your couch ever just a couch?
Are you a fan of the Rolling Stones as well, Doctor?
My oral fixation only seems to be getting worse.
Six months of therapy and all I've gotten from you is lip service.
My mother is eating me alive.
Right now I feel like it's all just swallowing me up.
I feel like all you're giving me is lip service.
Nice move on making sure I’m not too comfortable.
I guess I should be thankful you're not a Freudian
Doc, you can kiss my ass for all I care.
Are you sure you're in my insurance network?
I am experiencing deep feelings for this chaise, and have no desire to leave anytime soon.
I got real issues, Doc. I didn’t come here for lip service.
I get it: "these lips were made for talkin, and thats just what they'll do"
I was born in a crossfire hurricane and was raised by a toothless, bearded hag.
This is the only bright spot in my day.
Maybe I'm just a sucker
My wife keeps finding lipstick stains on my collar.
I'm glad you're not a French psychoanalyst.
My first greatest fear is a clown with big red lips.
My second greatest fear is a sofa that looks like a clown's big red lips.
Happy Valentines Day to you too.
You keep telling me I've got an oral fixation, but it's your couch!
Was that your mother’s favorite lipstick color too?
I'm having a recurring dream involving Mick Jagger.
Can we move on from mother issues?

I’m just a misunderstood morsel being swallowed alive by a ravenous world.”
Have you noticed how the New Yorker caption contest has started to recycle cartoons with only minor variations? Like, they’ll have a guy on a psychiatrist’s couch, but the couch will be shaped like a pair of lips. It’s really bumming me out.
Is there a reason I'm laying on Mick Jagger's lips?
I feel better already!
By the way,where did you get that stunning lounging jacket?
It’s been eating at me.
I’m almost done. It’s either Kamala or Kirsten, I promise.
It’s all  good. I’m fine now
So does this one have the Scotch Guard or Blistex coating?
Since I've been coming here I dream that of getting eaten by Mick Jagger.
Are you sure we've done everything, Doc?
Shhh!
Did you say this furniture was donated by Dr Ruth?
This couch is eating me alive!

Don’t pretend there’s something with me. You’re the one who bought the couch that looks like a pair of bright red lips!
So this is just generic, not the Rolling Stones logo sofa?
Does this mean I have to kiss and tell?
Are you sure I'm not running my big mouth too much?
I’m just saying...I don’t see why WE need to be in Black and White, just to show off this bloody couch!”
Is it just my subconscious, or does this couch look like lips?

So I had this Daliesque dream ...
It’s lip service.
I feel like I'm still in Kansas.
Your lips tell me no-no, but there's yes-yes in your eyes.
Just tell me it doesn’t french.
Doc, am I crazy, or did you botox the couch?
Before we start, do you have a couch that is more my shade?
Doc, I feel like I am lip-synching  my life story!
Yes Doc, it does help open me up a bit, but that’s because there’s a tongue in my ass.
I'm just glad you specialize in oral fixations.
I have to admit, I'm not feeling the love here.
Nice touch, but it needs a vibrator.
What do you give the women? A couch shaped like a giant cigar?

You know doc, I think they lied to you when they said , “red goes with everything.
Tell me Brian, what gives you the impression I'm paying you lip service?
I don’t know how else to explain it except I just feel like a giant cold sore when I’m here.

It’s not you, it’s this couch.
Swallowed and spit out
... and lately I feel like my troubles are eating me alive!
I don't FEEL like a snack.
I just feel like I’m being swallowed whole...
This is my way of complying with my patient's request when they get my bill.
Why do I get the feeling I can't get no satisfaction here?
Why do I feel you're just paying me lip service?
Sorry, Doc. I appreciate your efforts but I'm still not ready to date yet.
I still feel like I'm stuck on first base.
Doc, you've got something stuck between your teeth.
I know it’s a statement piece but I feel uncomfortable discussing my mother.

I thought you said I could sit on your LAP?
Why the pursed lips, doc?
So you don’t really read lips, do you
Did I ever tell that you have the most amazing lips.
Now I can see why you are able to charge so much - do they vibrate too?
Do you have any lip balm?
I'm so grateful that this couch has no teeth.
We aren't talking about the kiss of death are we?
I want a kiss.
I'm  obviously feeling down in the mouth, Doc.

So they tell me you're a huge Stones fan.
I keep dreaming about the kiss of death.
When do we get to the part about the prescription?
You say Mick Jagger gave you this couch?
I would rate 8 for design and 5 for comfort.
I'm starting to see things as less black-and-white.
I think it's working. I'm feeling less anxious, and more luscious.
Tell me again about this supposed oral fixation you are feeling?
I feel my wife is constantly speaking for me...
I feel like my ship is sinking . You might need to tighten these lips.
I just feel like life is consuming me.
And that’s how I met your mother.
Honestly, I just feel like all I'm getting out of these sessions is lip service.
For some reason I feel more like discussing my sexual fantasies today."

I want your red couch painted black" ~The Rolling Stone
This isn’t a sex thing, is it?
I think we should send it back, honey.
I don’t know when it started really, an ever present fear of being eaten. But the funny thing is, if anything it has intensified  since we started our sessions.
I feel like this is just lip service.
Don’t you believe tulips are better than one?

Do you really care or is this just lip service?
Don't you mean lips, Freudian lips?
Every time I come here I have these strange dreams about Mick Jagger.
Will I be swallowed by the couch if she blows me a kiss.
I think you’re actually the one with the oral fixation.
Is it normal to feel like the world is going to swallow you whole?

This couch lends itself to a whole new fantasy!

...And then she goes, “Bill! Meh,meh,meh....I can’t  be married to someone who identifies as poop...yadda yadda yadda.” Oh, I like the new furniture by the way.
Whatever you tell me, these lips are sealed.
You're sure this is going to help with my fear of Rocky Horror?
Let me get this straight, you have a recurring nightmare where giant red lips consume you?
Is it normal to think of Mick Jagger all day, doc?
I feel The Love already, unlike the relationships that got me here in the first place.
Let me get this straight - I can choose whether you address me as 'Doll Baby' or 'Sugar Tits'?
So Doc, do you know much about oral fixations?
It all began at the premiere of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
It's happens everywhere Dr. I manifest memories of mothers overwhelming smothering control.
I keep having a fear of being swallowed up.
This feels like lip service to me.
I just feel like I am being swallowed alive.
Is this some kind of subliminal message?
I bet you think everyone has an oral fixation.
If it's such a good conversation starter, why don't other psychiatrists have one in their offices?
I feel like everyone is always trying to give me the kiss-off.
Doctor, what’s an oral fixation?
"You just don't know what it's like to have your wife leave and take the good furniture."
If you want a different answer, get a couch that doesn't whisper suggestions in my ear.
Do you think the fact that I like your new couch is related to my mom?
I appreciate the effort, Doc, but in the dream, I'm lying in a bed of TU-LIPS
Last time you were here we were discussing the Rolling Stones
These lips sink hips.
So, you limit your practice to fetish patients?
I am so glad they have a bring your therapist to work day.
Do you want it straight from the mouth?

Let's try a prescription for Lipitor.
She said I was a nothing, a mere morsel to chew up and spit out. Do I look like that to you, Doc?
You know, it really does tie the room together.
No, I don't think the fact that I see this couch as a pair of lips is an indication that I have an oral fixation.
Your couch is licking me again. Not that I mind...
I'm just trying to come up with a clever caption for this weeks New Yorker cartoon contest.
I should have known that loose lips sink......
Considering I'm coming here for my sexual addiction, this hardly seems appropriate...
How much longer do you need to finish the drawing?
I feel like a slip 'twixt the  cup and the lip
What makes you think my mother couldn’t open up?
I fear everyone keeps giving me lip service!
And lying in a woman’s lips is supposed to make me feel better about my mother how?
I get it. Your lips are sealed. Is there a reason you keep saying that?
I'm not sure how lying on Mick Jagger's lips will bring me satisfaction, but I'm willing to give it a try.
It’s awful Doc. Every Tuesday night; I dream I’m being swallowed by a pair of lips.
Don't judge me. You're the one who bought a couch shaped like Julia Roberts' lips.
It's like your kiss, your kiss, is on my list...
Would you care to play role reversal?
I can still feel her lips on me.
You really care...or just giving lip service ?
Why when I come here I always feel I get lip service?
This couch is quite lovely. But does it come in gray?

Your couch helps me to talk.
Are you aware this couch exemplifies my problem?
Did you say this new couch was a design by Carly Simon or Mick Jagger?
I hear loud wet smacking sounds when I lie down
Honestly Doc, I have this sensation that I'm about to be swallowed whole.
Sorry, it was on the tip of my tongue.
Did you buy this couch from the No Tell Motel that just went out-of-business?
Remember: loose lips sink shrinks.
I think I may be developing an oral fixation
What kind of fixation did you say?
For some reason I can't seem to forget my first wife's beautiful ruby red lips."
I have a reoccurring dream that The Rolling Stone's logo is after me.
Doc, I can't seem to free myself from this big oral fixation of mine.
Did you write down that my problem began when my wife saw the lipstick on my collar, and that I can’t seem to forget that image?
Just thinking ahead, but what the couch will look like after I move on from this 'oral stage' fixation?
I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you more, but my lips are sealed.
I don’t think this is what Freud meant by “oral stage.”
I’m telling you Doctor, I see mom’s red lips every where!
You want me to sit on WHAT when we're done with the oral stage?
Sorry, Doc, no matter what I say, you'll think I'm weird.
Can't help but feel you're just giving me some lip service Dr. Pencil
I guess, we know the same woman.

Doctor, I have to ask you, what is your financial connection with Botox?
My wife keeps finding lipstick on my collar.
This really isn't helping my aphenphosmphobia.
Is this our 'kiss and tell' session?
We find that the new decor inspires Freudian slips.
When was your first memory of your oral fixation?
I thought my couch was one of a kind?
Nice couch. Reminds me of AB positive.
''And it just eats me up inside.''
This may cause more problems than it solves.
Doctor, whatever your conclusions are, I hope it's not just lip service.
So you and the room are both by the hour?
Are you sure this is the best therapy for my oral fixation?
I have never really been the kind to kiss and tell

 a bordello when I was growing up. Maybe that’s why I feel so comfortable with you doctor “

No, sex has nothing to do with it...
So doctor...how are you?
I was hoping that you could lip read.

It’d work better a shade darker.

Sne told me what to do, and I went there in a handbasket.
If this is the couch for oral fixation, I'm wondering what your other furniture looks like.

I just can’t stop this feeling of sexual inadequacy.....
Hmm...I’m not sure a therapist should advertise, but if you’re going to do it, I guess “You’ll get more than just lip service from Dr. Ken”  is as good a tag-line as any.

...but Mick Jagger rejected me.
I have a love seat instead of a couch.  I think it better reflects the atmosphere I want to project.

I'm doing much better, Doc. Before we started meeting, I didn't want to ever leave the couch.
You're not just giving me lip service, are you Doctor?
I prefer this couch to the anal phase bean bag
Need help spelling 'Scylla and Charybdis'"
How much do you charge the couch when it starts talking?
This couch - from the Loretta Switt collection

Sometimes I feel you're just giving my lip service.
Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss.
I feel like I've been chewed up and spit out.
Now I've got lipstick on my collar AND all over the back of my suit.
Is that whole thing I just mentioned about lip service too on the nose?

I’m just thinking about a cigar.
I actually don't have any problems, I'm just hear because I heard that you have the most comfortable couch.
Do you think that maybe we should change places?
Freudian Lips
It's been eating me up
My lips say one thing but mean a mother.
The color red makes me angry.
I’m oral.
I misunderstood your radio ad. I thought it said Lack of Love Counseling, not Lap.
I can't do this anymore, you're weirding me out ... is that curable?
Maybe so, doc, but is it possible that you are the one with the mommy issues?
Nice couch.  Have fun with it when no one is here?
I’m sorry that I had to bring my sofa from home, but your sofa didn’t fit my style.
Strange, every session I begin fantasizing about oral sex.
you people
You see me as more than just a sex object, don't you?
Look, Doc, the "LIPS ARE SEALED" motif is wonderfully comforting but could you talk to me?
Some days I feel like a cold sore.
Are you writing down my Freudian lips, er, slips?
Sometimes, I can't help feeling moist.
My problem is that I tend to see things in black and white
..”and I thought I had an oral fixation!”
This is the closest I’ve been to a woman’s lips in over a year.
Ok Doc, tell me again about this oral fixation theory.
Now I feel like a uvula!
I told her not to give me lip, and now this couch is all she left me.
I'm torn -- was it the Kiss of Death?  Or just a kiss-off?
Every time I come here I find myself preoccupied with my relationship with my mother.
I don't like that we're Cartoon Contest #666.
Everywhere I go, I see her luscious full lips. Am I crazy or do see them too?
I would be more comfortable talking to you if you offer me a drink first before I lie down.
Just out of curiosity, where do you keep the couch for the 'anal stage'?
What do you mean; read my sofa,
 no more new phobias ?
Would it screw up the whole session if I put my head at the other end
Kiss my ass.
I don't need your lip service, Doc.
I feel ... wherever I go ... she devours me ...
Once I land on this couch I feel free to discuss all my erotic fantasies.
My brain keeps saying “Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe...
I see a paper cup and two straws.
And you think I'm the Freudian one"
Did I mention my Oedipal complex ?
Doctor, I think you have some confirmation bias.
Sir, this really goes beyond my training as a plastic surgeon..
Even when I'm winning, I still feel like I'm getting licked.
It's 1972, I'm 10 years old, and this sofa's sister did things to me.
Why is your advice always to "Kiss that one goodbye?
My kissing fantasies have actually worsened since I started these sessions.
The couch and chair don't match!
It feels like my whole life is being put on exhibition.
No, I like it.  It reminds me of being depressed in college.
Sometimes I feel just like a rolling stone.
Sometimes I think you're just giving me lip service.
Papa was a rollin' stone...
Whoever wins this contest #666 is going straight to hell.
Instead of listening you’re just giving
me lip service
When she told me to read her lips, I knew it was over...
I just feel like all anyone can ever offer me is lip service
I have this overwhelming urge to change my name to Mick.
Is this couch form "The Love Connection"?
I think I dream in color, but I live in black and white.
How do I know that  your lips are sealed?
How is this supposed to help my fear of kissing?
But I can't stop thinking that I'll end up with lipstick on my collar my wife'll kill me.
Why is everything so Freudian?
I can't read your lips.
I can't help but feel you're biased toward a Freudian approach.
I have this persistent dream of being consumed by my mother...
Does the Love seat remind you of anything?
I know it sounds crazy, doc, but somehow you remind me of Mick Jagger.
Watcha got there, Doc?
Sorry, doc, I don't know why I'm giving you such lip today. I know you're trying to help.
So, my fear of used dorm furniture had been getting better.
Our new model has a lower lip
Does this shade of upholstery go with my phobia?
What do you mean, 'Not everything is black and white'?
So then he said, "you have a big mouth."
That suggestion sounds like the kiss of death
I keep giving him signs doc, but the man I love just can't take a hint.
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
Not to get off topic, but was this couch tested on animals?
Sorry, Dr. Williams. Red hot lips always make me sleepy.
I take it you're part of the Freudian school.
Do we ALL have mother issues?
I have this recurring dream where I'm being eaten by Marilyn Monroe.
Doc, it just seems that everything reminds me of my mother!
Hey, are you a shrink or a liposuctionist?
I'm not sure how, but my wife always knows when I've been to therapy.
I'm more  than   she  can chew.Right.
Oh yeah,and the casting couch didn't affect #metoo?
Her lips were to die for.
Doc, why do I feel you’re giving lip service to my problems?
Has this couch ever been satin?
I think you think I'm only comfortable with lip service.
My whole life, women have treated me like a toothpick.
Why do people say there’s something sexual about confession?
Just a quick "kiss and tell" right?
Oedipal, indeed. In point of fact, I’m feeling positively promiscuous.
Before you start, the answer is your mother
I wish these lips were made for kissing because it been too long!
Either your couch is talking to me, or I'm really nuts!
I asked my boss to stop giving me lip and he sent me to you.
Will this kiss make it all better?
You bought this couch from Sigmund mother?
I can't stop obsessing over her full, lush, ruby red lips.
I'm finally feeling the love.
In the dream I kept saying, "It's not my color!"over and over again.
Could you stop saying “Put your money where my mouth is.”?
Somehow I'm triggered as soon as I get here.
From your lips to my cheeks...
Red Red Whine
I'm having reoccurring dreams about Betty Boop.
From your lips to your ears
Please don't write down that part about voting for Bernie - that was just a wild fantasy.
Like many psychoanalysts I feel obliged to pay lip service to Freud.
I tried getting used to red, but I'm more of a hot pink kinda guy.
I remember feeling smothered by Mother’s kisses.
I’m so glad we’ve worked past my anal fixation.
It's presumptuous of you to presume that I'm a Republican
Wow you’re right....the hate is just melting away!
I've always found color in a cartoon to be very intimidating.
I know I said I have intimacy issues but did you really have to go this far??
It all started at the late night, double feature picture show.
I'd like to ask the couch if it prefers my edible complex with or without mustard.
I`ve noticed that I am making much better progress on my wife problem than on my mother problem.
Everything reminds me of her lips.
You ever have the feeling you've been chewed up and spat out?
I had that Rocky Horror dream again.
...and all I ever get is lip service.
I know I said I was over my cheilophobia
“Would it be weird if I gave you a big wet kiss?"
After every session, I feel like I've been chewed up and spat out.
and that's when I realized a kiss is just a kiss...
Now let’s discuss when your phagophobia began
Mae West has been appearing in my dreams lately. No idea why.
We left off last week's session discussing thought suppression and mother's lipstick."
I don't know Doc, but why when I leave your office do I feel so down in the mouth.
If I stop pouting can I have my old couch back?
Doc I've been down in the mouth lately.
I crave moisturizer.
Well Doctor, I saw her today at the reception with a glass of wine in her hand and 
I knew she was gonna meet her connection because at her feet was a footloose man.
I'm not sure the word for my feelings, but it's on the tip of my tongue....
Seem to be feeling a little down in the mouth today?
i feel like the couch is already helping with my fear of getting eaten by my aunt Lydia
Doctor, I am getting really tired of everyone telling me that I only see the world in black and white.
The problem is on the tip of the tongue.
I'm the reincarnation of Sigmund Freud. What would you like to know
It all began in a candy store when I was a kid.
My mother’s favorite lipstick was this shade of red.
I feel as if I’m in a coffin.
I still don't see how this alleviates my oral fixation.
Further, I detest your pencil's carbon trail.
So about this oral fixation thing.....
Sometimes I feel like this city is trying to swallow me alive.
Every time I come here doc I feel like I am about to be swallowed whole.
So, what IS an Oedipus complex?
OK,I  get it.  You are sick and tired of my paying lip service to your interpretations.
I just don't feel vivid.
The name is 'Herb Lipshitz' ...and yes, I'll pay to have it cleaned.
I'm glad we're talking about my obsession with "Rocky Horror Picture Show" now.  The "Jaws" couch was not comfortable at all.
When did you start piping in The Rolling Stones music ?
Does this come in any other color?
You really think this will help my oral fixation?
I always feel like everyone is trying to give me the big kiss off!
Enough of your lip.
I can't escape this feeling that I'm trapped in a Dali painting!
I keep having dreams where I'm just a giant chapstick.
Doc- Seriously don't need this kiss, but could sure use a big hug.
I have this recurring dream that Mick Jagger is about to swallow me...
I have this recurring dream: I'm on a beach, my psychiatrist is out in the water, waving his arms--drowning--and I'm waving back, laughing hysterically.  Do you see a problem?
I liked the armchair and the footstool better.
I'm reassured by my proximity to the oral cavity
Yes. A lot of my referrals are from word of mouth.
Come to think of it, I do feel more connection with Dalí here.
I’m obsessed with ankles; they’re everywhere I look.
Botox?
I know its irrational, but could it be that I'm kissophobic?
I always felt unloved....until now
I have this recurring nightmare I'm being eaten alive!
So that prescription will cure my obsession with red couches?
Everything is sexual.
It was a better fit in our old dorm.
Is your hourly rate the same after dark?
I feel that all I receive from the world is lip service.
Please don't write that down...I didn't mean to say it.

Her name was Angie, and we were like Wild Horses together.
I just have this uneasy feeling you are trying to kiss my...
I keep wanting to tell people "kiss my ass"
Initially, I was ambivalent about lip balm.
Doctor very week I wonder about your obvious oral fixation...
I can't help thinking your just giving me lip service.
Well kiss my ass!
I do love her but the smell of her lipstick makes me think of Mommy...
Oddly, it only eats at me when I’m here.
Therapeutic seating, I get it.. but my phobia concerns Tulips.
I didn’t’t know there was a shrink in senate chambers.
I have an uncanny urge to gloss over my past.
I dream that I am being eaten by Mick Jaggar!
You can put lipstick on it, Doc, but you can't make it whistle.
I said I'm obsessed with women's hips."
I thought when she said cheat day she was talking about her diet
I didn't come here for lust!
I hope you're giving more than lip service here.
Whenever I come here, I have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling.
She said I was like a bad taste in her mouth.
Is this your idea of a joke, Doc.?Just because last week I said I was feeling down in the mouth.
My mom says I have an oral fixation. What do you think, doc?
I have the same couch in blue.
Thank's Doc...... for listening to me with my big mouth.
Thank you for the lip service, doc.
Why is it always a kiss and tell?
What is black and white and Freud all over?
I feel your pain, now I have my chair back?
What`s Mick doing without these?
Paying for lip service
Yes, my insurance covers lip service.
Somehow I have come to feel like I am just an amuse bouche
I have these dreams of lying on a lip-shaped sofa and wondering what could be so funny about it..
Do I pay extra for the tongue that's licking my butt?
Are you getting all this?
Only on your couch, doctor, do I feel loved for real.
But enough lip service, tell me how you really feel...
I love myself way more than I love you, and I think about killing myself.  So, best believe, I thought about killing you today.
Feeling down in the mouth?
I keep having a fantasy  that I’m lying in a bed of two lips.
Doctor, tell me, what does the couch you use for the anally retentive look like?
I fear these sessions are simply......lip service.
Am I getting better or just paying for lip service?
So what event triggered this idea that the world will swallow you whole
Jerry, I don’t kiss and tell
Everything always comes down to sex with you guys.
You've brought color into my life.
Would you have a couch that doesn't remind me of her?
Funny...but why do I always have a Rolling Stones ear worm when I meet with you?
Do I smell lip balm?
I assume you're a Freudian?

I feel I'm just getting lip service all the way around.
I really don't need any lip from you.
I have a recurring dream that I'm being eaten by a woman with thick lips.

It does help, bit I still think my wife should be here too.
I am seized with an overwhelming desire to kiss you.
You're left almost bankrupt, Mr. Crowe.  Now, prayer is everything.
Something is telling me that I might have some mother issues.
Are you sure the "returning to the womb" therapy starts this way?
I want to move to the brown stool.
Let me stop you right there. I didn't realize lip service was paid for by my insurance.
For some reason that first Stones concert keeps coming to mind.
Everyone thinks I'm a big sucker.
I keep thinking of mother.
Why do you say she is smothering you with love?
I'm afraid to make a Freudian lip.
I seem to be obsessed with the marvelous first kiss
Yes, now that you mention it, that couch WAS a gift from Mick Jagger.
I'm struggling, with the debt on my credit card for my therapy sessions.
Where are the tissues?

I feel...trapped by her words.
I feel you're taking my comment a bit too literally, doc.
I'm feeling...like I could kiss you.
All my life people have been giving me lip
Am I just paying for lip service?
The hour is almost finished. Do you have anything to say, Doc?
For some reason I feel like kissing you, doctor.
I'm afraid you don't have a sofa for my fixation.
But why the technicolor botox dreams, Doc?
I had that dream about you and Mae West again.
Love this new Freudian slipcover!
So my libido is repressed?  The break of your pantlegs  is somewhat  short.
You SAY you’re listening but it just feels like lip service to me.

And what does my couch make you think of?
Your Yelp review focused more on your credentials but this is a great couch.
Me? You think I have an obsession with oral sex?

Are you testing your patients’ fears of maternal incorporation or did you just opt for pop art decor?
Eight hundred dollars for lip service?
It's baffling, doc. In this nightmare, I keep being chased by a giant pair of waxed lips.
Better red than dead" applies here too
I don't get laid anywhere but here
If everything is a metaphor, I think we’re making progress.
Are you SURE you're comfortable doing this at my place?
Your lips to God's ear.
Do you use this couch because I am still in the oral phase of development?
...and her big red lips were kissing me all over..
I prefer a lighter shade of red next time!
Lucky for you we have a sale on Botox and lip filler.

I need more color in my life.
What does it mean? The red love seat and you sitting over there?
These surrealist fantasies are taking over my life
Somehow, I'm very comfortable putting words in her mouth.
It's like I'm not seeing things as just black and white anymore.
What's your hourly rate for this lip service?
I had that dream again last night, the one where Marilyn is trying to devour me."

When I come here, my blues seem to go away.
I'm obsessed with French kissing.
I keep having dreams of a sexual nature regarding your couch.
I don't charge less if you sleep.

Wax lips are a favorite childhood memory.

Unununnh ....I can feel her tongue as we speak!
Do I need to say it? Just read my lips!
Psst... is the couch available for dinner?
Look Doc, my life isn't just a bed of roses.
Yes doctor, I’ve had this obsession with Roche Bobois since my mother bought those mismatching floor sectional pieces in the 1990s.
I've adored Marilyn ever since I was in kindergarten.
I'm sorry, Doc, but a lie-down and smooch from Mick's lips aren't going to solve my problems...
When do you think I'll progress to the anal stage, Doctor?
After her botox treatment I keep seeing big lips everywhere
Momma always said I had moods like Jagger.”
Your not just giving me LIP SERVICE, are you doc?
Somehow I feel like you need to update your methods
So now I never think about her at all.
Sublimation, my ass. Somebody keeps saying "who wants kisses?".
It's better if I keep my mouth shut.
And then she said I had white privilege. Does she not realize how long I had to wait for my private jet to be refueled? I'm a victim of the system too!
Where was this art auction?
Is it me or does this couch smell like cherries.
What in the world are you holding?!
I can't explain why, but I'm just feeling tongue-tied.
I feel I'm about to be eaten by my mother.
I hear your list  of  former patients includes both Mick Jagger and Jack Nicholson.
Mind if I give you a more candid answer about my mother and "shoes on the furniture"?
You Freudians couch everything in terms of oral fixations!
This is not helping with my sex addiction.
You know Doc, this very red couch says a lot about you.
I was accused of objectifying women. How ridiculous! I love women, especially their lips. 
....I knew you’d understand.
Who'd have thought that ass-kissing was an effective form of therapy?
I dunno, I guess I'm stuck. I can't seem to get her soft, pillowy lips out of my mind.
I’m sorry Doctor, but even your couch, triggers my Oedipal complex.
I've always wanted to be kissed all over.
Have I lost a lot of blood, detective?  This sofa used to be white.
I'm here for lip service.
Do you mind if I smoke?  It seems my oral fixations are acting up again.
Take a seat, Bill. My nap's going to be over in like two hours, we'll talk about your pay raise then.
This red couch sure does strike the right note of middle aged whimsy!
I must admit I feel better in red lipstick.
What makes you think I’m lying?
Then Mae West swallowed and I woke up.
Why is the sofa wet, John?
Now  I know why you don't speak much...Because I'm laying on your mouth piece!
Would you mind moving your chair over there? Turning my head to make eye contact with you is straining my neck.
Everywhere I look, I see her. Her hair in wind chimes. Her eyes in pancakes.
I have this crazy feeling that I am in Salvador Dali’s living room and melting clocks are chiming.
What do you mean "I have an oral fixation"?
I would not trust a thing it says.

This feels different. Did you finally get those Collagen injections?
I'd like to discuss my fears of the MeToo movement.
Why do I feel like you're just giving me lip service, Doctor?
I just can’t get her lips out of my mind.
I have the sneaking suspicion you'll oversexualize everything I say.
Are you the kind to kiss and tell?
Red is not my color.
Thank you. These sessions on your red couch are the most vibrant things in my gray life.
I know it's a chaise longue, but it feels more like a chaise tongue.
I don’t think this helping my problems with oral fixations!
So, it's actually ok to kiss and tell?
Doc, I’ve got this strong urge to kiss my pillow.”

I feel you’re just paying me lip service.
This must be HEAVEN?
I feel like everyone is giving me the kiss-off.
Your couch could use some Chapstick!
I can't shake the feeling that I am going to be eaten by a gigantic woman!
The world seems...Daliesque.
I don't know if this is a problem, but I keep seeing images of Connie Francis and wondering if I have any lipstick on my collar.
Thanks for asking. Make mine a Tanqueray martini on the rocks with 2 olives.
I’ve always though psychiatry was just a bunch of lip service.
No, the session doesn't feel any sexier today
I don't care if it makes you horny Doc, this couch is grotesque!
I'm not sure why, but this couch always makes me think of Mick Jagger.
I feel like such a schmuck!
I would prefer the Le Corbusier chaise.
I had that nightmare again. The one where I come here and suddenly find myself lying inside a giant Venus flytrap.
I told you : The truth , not lip service...
This is the moistest couch I've ever been on.
Doc, I come here for more than just lip service.
Gift from a happy former patient?
Why are you so down in the mouth?
My biggest issue seems like it is right on the tip of my tongue.
Sometimes, I wish had the moves like Jagger, too.
They say “Red, red, wet the bed”
This couch so reminds me of Marilyn.
How do I feel? Balmy!
Doctor, explain again how the mirror on the ceiling helps my therapy
It doesn't help that your sofa reminds me of my ex's mouth.
Are these lips really molded from Mick Jagger?
Did I mention, I have an oral fixation?
You'll need a larger notebook than that for my tale of woe.
I ALWAYS pray like this
What do ya think it means, Doc? I keep dreaming about red lips.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been kissed like this.
I'm always under the impression I'm on somone's lips.
Thank you Dr. Jagger. You've made me realize that I've bitten off more than I can chew.
Worst of all, I can't seem to shake the feeling that you're only paying lip service to anything I say.
What do you mean that I have a problem with it? You the one who picked it out.
I wish I didn't have to come to therapy to get some peace and quiet.
I just told her to read my lips.
Why is Mick Jagger always looking at me?
Read my lips... wait, who said that?!
Doctor, would you consider yourself to be a “Freudian”?
Oh, I don't know. Probably once or twice a day.
How long have you had this oral fixation?
Sometimes it's like I'm being eaten alive, but then it's like I'm being kissed...it's all so confusing when I see you.
But I speak in tongues only if the spirit moves me.
How often do you feel that a 50' woman is going to swallow you
I just can’t get past the fact that your hourly billing rate is more than mine.
Doctor, I have this somewhat existential feeling of  continually being in danger of being swallowed up.
Can we switch chairs I''m a germaphobe?
I feel like I'm put on the spot.
I assume this is the only object-shaped couch you have, right Dr. Lipschitz?
Tell me doctor, should I feel  loved or devoured?
...you were Mick Jagger and I was Steven Tyler...
It’s just lip service
This one is much more comfortable than the Jung.
I think I forgot to kiss my wife goodbye.
They say you're the best to help me kiss my blues good-bye.
And I thought my mother-in-law had a big mouth.
Sometimes I feel like everyone's just paying me lip service.
I do like this couch better than the brown one.

In these nightmares, my ex-wife opens her big mouth and swallows me.
Yeah, the issue is definitely my mother...
I feel like I should gloss over my childhood, for some reason.
Are you just paying me lip service doc?
I've just been feeling really lipless...
Sorry, not a Stones fan.
Why do you say I’m getting lippy?
I didn't buy it. What does it mean to the guy who did?
No no no, I’m not a therapist. I’m a love doctor.
And in my dream, I'm being engulfed by a giant version of my mother's ruby-red lips. Am I crazy?
If all the world is a stage, I feel like I’m in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
I fear I’ll be consumed by the next woman I lie with.
I feel pursed.
I feel like you're just paying me lip service.
Your couch reminds me of how much I love my Tesla.
My mother this color lipstick. I'll bring my yoga mat next time.
Dr. Hippocrates, I can't believe that after getting your M. D. degree at Harvard and doing your residency at Johns Hopkins that you let your couch do the talking for you.
And then my wife said 'If you don't like m shade of lipstick, I'm leaving you.'
Why do I get the feeling you're trying to kiss up to me for more money?
Are those booties for me"
I think you're just doodling and not listening to a word I'm saying.
I think you should be here and I should be there !
I have this feeling of being sucked dry
You say you keep seeing mouths in inanimate objects?
I appreciate the new couch but, honestly, I still feel unlovable.
Just to be clear, I’m the Doctor, you’re the Patient, and my rate stays the same, right?
Now can we talk about your issues?
Perhaps we should switch places. The choice of this couch could very well signify you have unresolved Oedipal issues.
I feel like she is devouring me!
I dread red!
This couch isn't helping with my psychosexual oral fixation.
Are you sure this is the best way to treat my fear of liposuction?

Doctor, my dog gets more “likes” in Facebook than I do!
I feel I've taken quite a lickin' in my life

I think maybe we're both going through some sort of crisis, Doc.
I bet I can guess who your most famous patient is.
Every day with her is like being eaten alive.
I had requested a "Sticky Fingers" sofa.
I must admit that I like the new office.
I had Ramen for lunch yesterday.
Here it's ok to kiss and tell
Does this couch come in other shades?
I really need you to be honest with me and stop kissing my ass.
Don't bother. This red thing proves I'm not paranoid after all.
Does Howard Stern do offices?
I talk best when I’m lying and I suppose that’s a Freudian’s lip.
I honestly don’t know how I got here
Was I snoring?
Listen, I'm not here for lip service...for HIP service.
Sometimes I feel the world should just kiss my ass.
Good grief, I made the couch blush.
Doctor, are you sure this will help me overcome my oral fixations!
Is there a reason why this couch looks like lips?
When I finally take my hands away to look, all I see is her face, inches away, saying “Come give your Auntie a kiss!”
No, I'd like to think I'm honest in my relationships...Yes, of course I washed my hands after the cranberry harvest.
Oh my, I have a sudden urge to kiss you!
I seem to have an oral fixation whenever I'm here.
Don't you think that's a bit of a leading question?
What  would it mean if I said this sofa looks like a woman's lips?
Actually, the problem is now lipstick stains.
You say I have an oral fixation, but you’re the one who has me lying down on a giant pair of lips.

Does insurance typically cover lip service?
Well yes, Mother was obsessed with Man Ray's work.
So what's eating away at you?
So far all I've gotten is lip service.
Honestly, it's nice to get my ass kissed here every week.
And if I weren’t orally fixated?
No, it’s not my lip service, it’s your nickels worth of advice.
You're not just giving me lip service?
I feel I'm laying on the edge of a precipice about to be swallowed...
your oral fixation has me uncomfortable
Doc, I need more than lip service.
Are you sure this will help me get over my fear of Botox?
My mother never kissed me as a child.
Should I start with my phagophobia?
Thanks, Doc.  I had no idea I had an oral fixation until I started coming here.
Note to decorator:  When I said I needed a love seat, I meant a short couch.
Could you speed it up? I think I'm hemorrhaging
Does thing thing have a tongue or is that a mouse?
I'm haunted with dreams about lips.
We should get a sectional.
Sorry Doc if I'm a little reluctant. I've never been a kiss and tell kinda guy.
I feel it literally sucking me in.
I think the blue one better captures my personality.
Doc, I am interested in more than just your "lip-service"!
You should see the couch I don't talk on
I feel much more comfortable on the couch too.
Your sofa does wonders for the self-esteem, doctor.  When one wants his whazzit kissed, one only has to sit down.
It's fine by me because the old couch also reminded me of my mother.
Sometimes, a lip is just a lip.
No, Doctor, I think "oral fixation" is a fine decorating motif, if a bit dated.
My wife and I differ on sex matters...I'm in favor of it.
In my dreams, I usually get swallowed by your couch...did you know there are teeth behind those lips?
So this is Tongue-ian therapy?
i'm afraid this lip is sealed.
You must spend a fortune on lip balm.
You have to believe me. I'm seeing this couch as red right now!
I'm not sure my oral fixation began prior to my walking in the door to this room.
How much for the sofa?
So it all began when Grandma suddenly started kissing us on the lips.
I hope I'm getting more than lip service for what I'm paying!
Now that I’ve hit the genital stage, shouldn’t we rotate the couch?
I feel like all you give me is lip service.
I am not fond of kissing.
Maybe you could reupholster it in a neutral color.
Can we talk about my mother now?
Come on doc, give it to me straight... I have this strange feeling that you're just kissing my butt
You are so clever.Laying on these lips opens me up.
Are these lips spitting me out or sucking me in?"
Is talking about upholstery too far off topic? Lip couches are always out-of-stock at my store...
Are you sure this is the right place to talk about my intimacy issues?
I can't quite explain, but it's as if I'm being consumed by a not particularly subtle emblem of desire.
When all you have is this couch, everything looks like oral fixation.
Something tells me you're about to give me the big kiss-off like everybody else.
I can't shake the feeling that I'm just getting lip service from you.
Quite frankly doctor, my world was gray and lifeless untilI started therapy with you
I thought about therapy, but then I realized furniture sales was more "me."
I think we're getting to the bottom of the surreal issues here.
Can't you hear me knocking??  I got the blues and a bunch of dead flowers. You gotta give me some brown sugar now, Bitch, so I can go ride my wild horses!  Now ask me another dumb question...
I thought you agreed I could mouth off this time.
I feel that all everyone gives me is lip service."
'Is it true what I heard, satisfaction guaranteed or your mania back?'
I simply cannot stop myself from talking smack.
I guess it all started with Hot Lips...
How is everything? Well, it's all right now. In fact, it's a gas.
I'll be bringing my own couch to all our sessions; it's the exact model and color of the one in my recurring dream.
I suppose this is the ONLY place I can kiss and tell.
I havetah say Doc- this lipstick sofa brings up the oddest thoughts !"                          JK Fuller, Genoa, NV
Don't you have a couch that does not feel like it is eating me.
What do mean lipstick fetish?
Fine, let's talk about my oral fixation!
So, now that you are in my chair, I'll tell you about my mother.
I feel the love.
I feel somehow like I'm kissing and telling.
It just feels like she is going to eat me alive sometimes?
Don't talk to me about repressed sexuality; I'm not the one with the lips couch.
She said that I was the kiss of death; do you think she meant that literally
My old fashioned angst feels so out of place on this couch
I have tremendous guilt over the extra cost of the color run.
I guess it's comfortable. I'm just a bit nervous about what I'll lie down on after I finish my Oral Phase?
I don't mean to gloss over everything, doc.
I feel like I'm seeing lips wherever I go.
I just can't talk freely about my fantasies without shag carpet.
Whatever you're jotting down, I own the copyright.
I'm beginning to think I'm not the only one with an oral fixation.
I can't stop thinking about my mother putting on her red lipstick.

'Is this your idea of creating intimacy in the post-MeToo era?
I told you...I don't kiss and tell.
What on earth am I laying on? It doesn't look like anything I've seen in my life.
Are you going to give me a sweetheart deal?
I fear having my psychosis swallow me whole.
Didn’t you say you specialized in anal fixations?
Does it feel balmy in here to you?
And then I had a craving for a tongue sandwich.
Who is to blame if you say “labile” and I heard “labia”?
Everything I see reminds me of The  Rolling Stones.
Sharing this really chaps me.
I don't know why it makes me think of her.
Hey Doc, should we change places"?
I don't know, Doc. But every time I come here, I think I'm about to be swallowed up?
It feels like you're just providing lip service.
"You want me to remove my shoes, don"t you?
Today I'd like to talk about why I can't get no satisfaction..."
Why do I feel you are giving only lip service to my ideas?
Just before the giant swallows me, I wake up and the nightmare starts all over again
I've been experiencing very sticky fingers lately.
You say, "Love and Relationships." I say, "Kiss off."
Ever since seeing JAWS, I've had this infantile fear of being eaten.

From these lips to God’s ears.
I like diversity in your furniture.

I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner
That is what I truly wish to be
Cause if I were a Oscar Mayer Weiner
Everyone would be in love
Oh everyone would be in love
Everyone would be in love with me
actually, Doc, the couch at home is just plain uncomfortable
Maybe, we can continue this over a drink?
When did you first begin thinking you were being eaten by a woman with red lipstick?
Loose lips sink psych trips.
Is this a new couch?
Since it is contest #666 I will  just say that the devil made me do it.
I’ll tell my wife this was helpful, so now can I have the blue pills?
Just lie back and relax you said?
I'm beginning to understand what you mean by "being too black and white"
This doesn't help me with my confusion between my fixation with pole dancers and my mother's farewell kisses.
I don't understand it, doctor. Since I started therapy I've developed an irrational fear of being bitten.
I wanted to tell her to "kiss my ass"
I've never said this before, when I come here have an urge to give you a kiss.  It somehow just comes over me?
Are you suggesting something?
Every session my blues fad away.
Are you from OK Cupid?
Let me tell you what's really eating me.
I asked for a lemon twist!
Well, I do believe that your decorator has discovered a new color, but why do you need to know how that makes me feel?
The only difference between me and a madman is that I'm not mad.
Are you sure you can hear me??
I have no idea.
If I stop talking, does it cost less?
I was accused of giving my patients lip service so I just stopped fighting it.
Remind me to pick up some lipstick for my wife after the session.
This feels like a bad setting for rejection therapy.
My recurring dream is that giant lips are performing fellatio on my whole body.
So, what's the deal with red couches shaped like lips?
No, this makes me feel less comfortable.
I don't know if my wife's going to like this.
It's gone beyond my relationship with my Mom. Now I'm seeing red on all topics.
What if it was the anal stage?
It should be a rock and roll reference about the couch being like lips, but it is caption contest number 666, so the hell with it.
I feel I am constantly chewed by my wife. I see her lips everywhere.
I forget which pill it was . . .  all I can think of right now is Mother's Little Helper.
And you said my complex was edible?"
Why do you keep asking me questions about furniture?
These sessions are definitely helping me adjust to her lip.
I feel that all I am getting  from you is lip service
But what if I refuse to share my vulnerability?
I'm feeling quite aroused right now.
An oral fixation? What makes you say that?
Every time I come here I feel a compulsion to sing Hello Dali...
Could I just turn over and whisper sweet nothings ?
Really?
Sticky Fingers is my favorite Stones album too.
I'm guessing you're a Freudian, Doc.
Do you have any matching pieces that go with the lip couch?
Oh doctor, you are all about love, but I have consequences.

Just don’t smack your lips!
Lately, it feels like I’m being swallowed whole.
Can you please stop saying “ka-ching!” every few seconds?
Yep.  I’m gay
Forgive me for the Freudian lip.
Are you sure the generic Lipitor is just as good as the name brand?
What is it with these couches and being charged by the hour?
I'm glad you got the oral sofa instead.
I assure you, you’re the one seeing red.
And I Come Here To Get Some Color In My Life
New Freudian couch, doc?
Sometimes I just feel like a Rolling Stones T-shirt
I'm not comfortable talking about it.
Honestly, I need a doctor who doesn't buy his furniture at rummage sale.
Left is right. Up is down. Mae West is Mae East.
You think it's an oral fixation?
Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
I’ve been hearing voices quoting Zsa Zsa Gábor...”
How much extra for a pucker?
You rent this place by the hour?
I love your couch.
I"d tell you more, but "loose lips sink ships."
I've developed Phagophobia.
I guess you must have a had a thing for Marilyn Monroe too.
Certain parties have informed me that coming here would be the kiss of death. Nothing to that, is there?)
Speak freely, we're the only ones here,
Maybe you’ve heard this one before but you don’t always get what you want. You get what you need.
No, I feel pretty calm ... why do you ask?
Doc, is there something you want to tell me?
My gambling problem relapsed in Georgia, this guy Johnny really fiddled with my confidence.
Patient fixates inexplicably on mother’s “ruby red lips” before falling asleep. Really love this new pen.
Mick Jagger isn't the devil?
I haven't been the same since  The Rocky Horror Show.
Your socks don't match.

I dreamt I was performing an organ solo
when the pianist approached with a bouquet of roses...
Tell  me again why you are attracted to red

Should I begin NOW?
I feel like everyone is kissing up to me.
Somehow I feel like I'm being eaten alive.
Madam Flora's parlor had a couch just like this.
I,m not paying you for lip service.
Every time I leave here, all I can think about are lips and breasts.
I feel as though I am being swallowed whole.
Doc, I just gotta say that this is a pretty tacky couch you got here.
What do I like most in a woman?  Let me throw that one back to you doc...
I came here because my office does not have a lounge.
Do you have any chapstick?
I've been feeling this way ever since The Rolling Stones stopped touring.
I have this thing about soft lips.
Wow — a different couch for each psychosexual stage!
I’d say ivory for the walls and ecru carpeting.
I always thought I was a good dad. But now my kids tell me i'm a dope,  sick, crazy dad who always make them feel chilled. Where did I go wrong doc?
P:“I like their music, but I really am horrified by the Rolling Stones”
D:“Would you say you have... Mixed Emotions?”
P: [Screams]
My ex-wife is always giving me lip, but she really let me have it after the divorce.
I’m feeling oddly free of my oral fixation issues.
I feel like I am only giving lip service to my past.
I gather that you're a liposuctionist.
It just all seems very surreal, doesn't it?
Can I bring my blow-up doll next time?
You're a good man; it's not all black and white
I find it hard to express my emotions. It's like my entire being is forever resting at the tip of my tongue.
So why do I suddenly feel this need for affection?
...and then she said I should be the one on the pill.
I’m only comfortable around ass-kissers.
I just feel like it's going to swallow me up.
I saw red and told her to kiss my ass.
I know I have a big mouth!
....and then cross-stitch my over-riding angst.
My mother never wore lipstick; do you think that is the root of my problem?
Why do you think it's 'interesting' that this sofa makes me think of my mother?
I love it when you talk dirty, tell me again about the women’s couch.
How about we go for a doughnut instead?
I've probably told you this before....
When I learned there was no "farm upstate" that my hamster ran off to, things really started to go downhill.
My lips are sealed , perhaps you can read my mind
I can’t stop thinking about my first kiss.
I don't know why but I have the feeling I might be the Antichrist.
You've got something on your lip
Sir, I know your wife is a big mouth, but in couples counseling it’s imperative that you both speak.
The meds you prescribed are REALLY working.
I hate that I'm a middle aged successful white guy with no psychological problems.  It makes me want to strangle my mother.
I don't know why, but I keep getting this intense feeling that my wife is telling me I should shut up and do what she says.
Doc, ever since I sat down I've been thinking of Mick Jagger.
How much longer do I need to hold this pose?
Well, since our last time I had a dream Mae West was tasting me.
Are you sure this is the best treatment for cheilophobia?
Actually, I was expecting something more than just lip service.
Wait. Aren't you supposed to be helping me get over my forty-year obsession with the opening credits of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show?"
Doc, is it possible that an old white guy could still have moves like Jagger?
Even your couch doesn't turn me on, Doc.
Is all of this going in your next book?
You think I'm lying?
I'm not here for help. Tell me, what did you pay for this couch.
Sometimes I feel you’re just paying me lip service.
Oh c’mon, who wouldn’t have an oral fixation with this couch!
You know, we don't have to go back to the other one once the work is finished.
But I can't be racist, I've always been color-blind.
I thought we were going to discuss my intimacy issues."
Doc, these lips are sealed.
By the way, the self-reproach I feel is really no different than the self-love everyone else feels. Right?
I feel like there has got to be more appropriate seating choices for patients.
give me a kiss to build a dream on!!
I don't feel like smiling any more
I feel like I am just getting lip service here
Lucifer
She couldn't remember me, but said I was on the tip of her tongue.
And that's why you walked in on me kissing my couch.

Yeah, pretty good. Yourself?
If you build it, they will come.
Mae I suggest we stop dilli Dali..ying around ...I have so much to discuss this week.
Dr. Why do I have recurring dreams that Jessica Rabbit is hugging me?
I don’t have anger issues.  I just DETEST your turtleneck!
I am here because I'm fixated on your crotch.
I was so close to getting over my fear of kissing girls, better put me down another year.
I hope I won't get herpes
I'm still addicted to doing The Floss when I leave here.
I think this would be a good time to tell you about my oral fixation.
Then she said "You're too fragile for me."
So then she asked 'paper or plastic'"..
I forgot that loose lips sink ships.
Your new office smells a lot like my moms house.
I know that your practice includes couples therapy, but when I'm here you have to cover up the mirror on the ceiling
Ill have a burger with cheese, get whatever you want...
....just a dash of Vermouth and of course, shaken not stirred

I understand running for president is a huge challenge but, you know, I'm ready for it.
I have this recurring nightmare that I’m in a Peter Max print.
I’m starting to suspect that your compassion is mere lip service.
Yes, the lips are sealed. You can't fall through the crack.
I don't think it's an oral fixation. I think it's the couch.
Doctor,I can't shake these feelings of inadequacy.
Then I dreamed I told your interior decorator to kiss my ass.  
What does it mean, doctor?
Are you Freudian or just your couch?
I'm getting nervous.  I feel she is smacking her lips
I don't know doctor … I'm not really feeling this shade of couch today.
Your childish use of symbolic furniture is no way to start a dialogue about the insecurities spawned by a mother who was emotionally unavailable during a painful adolescence while dad was drinking night and day.  In my senior year things got...
I dreamed I was a singer in a rock and roll band
I would tell you, but I don’t want to be involuntarily institutionalized.
It's a bit narrower than the old one, right?
Why did you bring my mother here?
I don't look like a tongue do I?
Everything with you is oral fixation.
You don't understand, doc.  I've got the blues.
Will he awaken to true love's first kiss?
Then she smacked me.
I don't know, I guess lately I've been feeling like I'm caught between words and my mouth doesn't know what to say...
No, I haven't seen 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'
Why do you ask?
I swear this presidency makes me see red.
My problems? You mean other than the hideous color of this couch?
It's a living!
For the record I usually don't menstruate at all...
From her mouth to yours!
Is there an extra charge for this love nest?
These sessions are the closest I ever get to a real woman.
Everything else is just grey.
Lips.
This isn’t helping my fear of flossing.
I thought I wasn't supposed to swallow my feelings?
I'm glad you aren't a Freudian who thinks everything we do is motivated by sex.
I'm not just giving you lip service.
Are you charging me for the lip service?
Have you thought about having your dreams analyzed?
Send the bill to Trump. He is the reason I am here.
Ass-Kissers have always made me comfortable.
For some reason, I get the feeling you've just been telling me exactly what I want to hear.
Funny, whenever I'm here I forget my problems and think about sex.
How do I feel? Like the lapping tongue on the Rolling Stones logo.
I may be paranoid  but I think you are just giving me lip service.
A kiss for my thoughts?  Why yes, I will accept a kiss for my thoughts.
Mind if I plant myself on these plump ruby-red lips of yours?
Yet,I'm still feeling  Blue!
I remember when I used to sit where you're sitting.
Your fees are indicative of several steps above mere lip service.
Of course I prefer the oral fixation chaise over the castration anxiety chair. Who wouldn’t?
Is that my lipid profile?
I can't stop hearing her voice in my head.
I can't kick this feeling like I'm being eaten alive.
What if I’ve no Ya Yas to get out?
I feel as though people are talking about me.
All I ever feel like saying to you is that she gave me hickeys.
We seldomly kissed...
Do you think I'll ever get over my foot fetish?
I get the strangest dreams about Marilyn Monroe.
This reminds me of a dream I had recently.
Roman Red! I owned a 1962 Tempest painted this color!
TO BUY:
- a less comfortable couch.
I’m afraid Freud would have questions about this couch.
"Are you sure you brushed your teeth today?
Racist? Not me. I don't see color.
If, as you say, a kiss is worth a thousand words, how much is this costing me?
It's astounding, dammit!  They keep looking at me so disappointedly, and ask "So, you really wrote the script and the music for the Rocky Horror Picture Show?  Really?"
My fantasy?  It’s all about lips
Do you want to know what I think about this?
Don't tell me...Mick Jagger?
I often feel like she's going to swallow me whole.
Nice collagen couch
You must be dreaming kissing giant lips
My mother's lips were never this red.
I see you  are trying to get in touch of your feminine side.

I can't forget the last big kiss she gave to me
I've always loved you.
I'd appreciate your professional evaluation. Everyone else just seems to give me blatant lip service.
I think I like you just because you're an unapologetic kiss-up.
A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the psyche.
Well, for what your charging, at least I'm getting a kiss.
Jeeves, I'd like a large cheeseburger, medium fries, and a small coke.
You red my lips for the final answer!
Doc, do you you think my wanting a purse is such a big deal?

I like your jacket. That's not just lip service, Doctor.
This chair is very comfortable
Well, this IS the same shade of lipstick my mother always wore...
Doctor, what's the meaning of 'Freudian Lips'? Er- I mean Freudian SLIPS!
I always feel one tweet away from vindication.
I'm not sure if I want to go to the dentist or listen to The Rolling Stones.
What happened to the tongue?
I don't just want lip service"
Every time I lay down with a pair of lips it cost me.
Does this shade of lipstick remind all your patients of their mommies, or is it just me?

So, she asked me, 'What is black and white and red all over,' and I said, 'Me on my therapist's couch.'  She then ended the date. I mean, I don't know what else the answer could be.
And everyone always complains that I use my big mouth too much.
All I get is lip service from the people I know!!
I'm not sure why but I have a sudden urge to kiss you.
You know how embarrassing it is to use public facilities?
I have anger issues. I keep seeing red.
...and I feel like shampooing just makes it shinier.
when you say you got it at The Factory sale,...
Did you say 'Freudian lips?'
No doc, I thought I was fine, you were the one I thought I can’t get no satisfaction.
This is the best lip plumping ever!
This really isn't helping my urge to rock and roll all night and party every day.
I always feel like food.

I know you are the doctor and I am the patient; but what is the hidden meaning of your couch being shaped like female lips swallowing your patients whole

From my lips to your ears doc...
I'm not sure how it feels to be on your own, with no direction home.
You feel sucked? I hear that a lot
In my world Doc, life is not a bed of roses. Tulips yeah.

After 15 years, I have nothing more to tell.
There is something about this couch that makes me want to kiss you."
Doctor, sometimes it feels as if I'm about to be swallowed whole.
I know it's by the hour, but...
Really? Lip service Freud?
Doctor:  Tell me about it
Patient:  I was born in a white house with a white picket...
Doctor:  I charge $350 an hour
Patient:  Day before yesterday...
From your lips to God’s ear doc.

The last one was a bit too on the nose.

Nice mood sofa.
Please tell my wife that I'm still in a coma

Anne McLeod, NSW, Australia
Did you REALLY say that?
I'm feeling an oral fixation
Could my problem be that I'm delicious?

I'm tired of this lip service, Doc. Can you help me or not?
Is this your way of telling me I have an issue with intimacy?
For some reason, I am fixated on my mother's lipstick today.
I feel like my name is on everybody’s lips...
My ex-wife was always giving me lip,
so I got to keep them in the divorce.
I am worried about straining your couch.
I appreciate you letting me come here every week when my wife refuses to kiss me.
Doctor, why is it that whenever I come here 
I get a yen for brown sugar

Talking about it like this reminds me of her.
I am anxious to avoid people who give me lip services
Should I be asking YOU about oral fixation?
Gee, doc, I thought you said your lips were sealed."
How do you know which count is correct?
You know, your couch really doesn’t help with divorce.
Doc, I am haunted by this recurring dream about the Rolling Stones and Mick Jagger.
Is the couch supposed to help with my labial mood disorder?
...but I have anxiety about having anxiety!
George, the questions I am going to ask you are designed to help you sort through the policy proposals of the Democratic Party's presidential candidates.
I know it was created by Dali but I keep having nightmares about melting clocks.

You know, as your therapist, when you spoke, I just drew a lot of doodles.
How much for the lip service?
Thank you. I always feel as if you are talking directly to me.

Not to turn the tables, doc, but I’m feeling that you could use a hug and a big kiss.
Now that you mention it, my mother did have large red lips.
Sometimes I feel like a Rolling Stone.
You know, sometimes I  just feel like a rolling stone!
I get it, you think I'm stuck in the oral stage.
Actually, I look better in Misty Coral and it doesn't smear.
My wife thinks I spend more time with you than her. Maybe if she stopped saying things like that it would change from  5 days to 3.
I'm feeling small.
Before we get started, can I borrow a lip balm?
Doc, uh, 1986 calle
I have a fear of swallows.

So now how did you say lick the cats lips?
No doc. It does not feel like I’m “getting a big kiss at the therapist’s office”.
But I AM John Galt!
'I thought, I'd erased her from my memory doc, but whenever I come here, all I can think about is her passionate kiss...'
How long have you been diagnosed with an oral fixation?
Is this couch a Freudian thing? Because I want a new doctor if it's a Freudian thing.
Let's explore that, Doctor.
I just feel like I'm paying for lip service

Can you believe that?
I came to you because you're supposedly good with porn addiction.
I see your other endeavor is proving the demon succubus is for real.
Can we stop talking about Mick Jagger and get back to my mother?

Lips speak louder than words!
Wait, does this exhibit charge by the hour?

Sometimes I wish the world would just swallow me up.
Is this the kiss of death?
Since I became CEO I see ass-kissers everywhere.
You know this isn't going to help my commitment issues.

I’m not sure the lips help. 
But I am glad you didn’t go with the Freudian couch.
The colour red makes me want to kill myself.
Her lips were not for me....
And you ask why I hate my wife’s lipstick?
I guess I'm trying to say most of my problems stem from the bright color of this couch.
This couch is not helping my fear of Joan Rivers.
I guess the anger management isn't helping because I'm still seeing red.
The really  existential aspect of this is how I  coaxed me into changing places with you.
I know I should be grateful for any kind of kiss, but I can't stop thinking about the Antichrist.

You really aren’t writing much given how
Much I’m saying...
And paying
I don't understand it Doc, but, since I've been coming here, my fear that my little company is going to be swallowed up by a big corporation has gotten even worse!
Lips...mouth....tongue...swallow....throat
I feel like my fears are going to eat me alive.
The lips of problems
Oddly enough, this expresses how I feel about your diagnosis.
Your lips say No, but your eyes say Yes.
Whenever I see you here, all I can think of is M.A.S.H. reruns!
Lately, I've had this sinking feeling about loose lips doc...
Since our last meeting I've been having dreams of my aunts, sisters, grandmothers trying to kiss me. It's been Thanksgiving, Christmas, and sixth birthday all over again.
Are you suuure you’re not a sex therapist?
Frankly, doctor, this is a sick way of  getting me to talk about 
my love life!
So, are you going to tell me what this couch is supposed to mean or do I have to talk about my mother first?
If  you’re going to use your time with me to sleep, I’ll just sit here and enjoy my morning coffee
Doc, I feel like you're only paying lip service to my intimacy issues.
Okay, so maybe your lips AREN'T sealed.

All I can really see is red, Dr.!

You need  to learn to suck face
I suffer from the illusion that everything I touch turns to giant red lips.

How do I feel? Very uncomfortable.

'Strange, just as I laid down  I have an my fear of coffee'
Excuse me but, you just called me Seymour.
I'm guessing all your patients need to talk about sex...
I don't know, doc.  Every time we talk I just feel even more down in the mouth.
John demonstrates his past relationship to his future ex therapist.

For some reason, I feel that your advice is only lip service.
Maybe I was just too sweet for her!

I'm hanging from your lips, doctor
I can't get the Rolling Stones out of my head. Do you know what I mean?
You’re not going to reseal these lips are you?
Funny, my mother's name was was Mae.
Why are you writing  about me?
I'm not that crazy!  I just said "It looks like Marilyn's mouth."
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink
I still don't feel like a tongue
I know I told you that I wanted to find someone with big red lips  ... but this doesn't counts

Lying with my big mouth or lying on a big couch, what difference does it make?
You trying to send me a message, Doc with this love seat?
Glad you like the couch; we want you to feel loved.
I sometimes feel like I’m lying on big red lips.  Is that normal?”

Robert Van Brocklin, Portland, Ore
I pretty much told her to kiss my ass.
I have found oral fixations explain everything...
You bought this from the Rolling Stones, didn't you.
I admit perhaps I can’t tell where she ends and I begin...
You think you have problems? Boy just you wait til you hear mine!
I feel consumed by guilt
The Prozac’s not helping. I’m still having intrusive thoughts about wax lips — but only during my sessions!
So I've got you down for a meatball sub with extra cheese.
Is Kylie Jenner expanding into the furniture business?
I feel like you're promoting the Oedipal complex, doc.
When I'm around ugly furniture... I don't know, Doc. I just start seeing red.
I'm not usually this puckered.
I have a problem with “lying lips”- not laying on lips.
At  this moment I’m feeling rather moist and enshrouded in sweet feminine breath !
You’re right — it’s impossible to pout!
Why yes Dr. Smoochy the new couch is quite comfortable.
So tell me, why do you think you are experiencing oral fixations at this time?
- I prefer the vertical leaps.
So, when I say the sofa looks like a slash of luscious red lips it's just my mother complex?   mdg
I am having the weirdest dream ... and I bet you’re going to tell me it has to do with my oral fixation.
She told me I had bad taste in furniture but I didn’t understand how bad it was until we split.
Doc.....I'm a SCATMAN.
Is it true that you were a Freudian when you bought this couch?
Your repose lacks mindfulness.
Are you sure that window is shut?
I have a fixation on sexy lips
I don't want to do the Time Warp again.

I expect more than just lip service doctor.
Well, it started with Facebook...but now I'm hearing tweets in my head.
It’s so cruel to have me lying on this sofa, knowing I’m in love with you.
I feel like everyone's trying to kiss my butt.
I just feel that it's going to consume me
I just don't know what to do with a President like this one.
Did you see what I did with that last witticism?
If you don't mind - next week I'll bring my three wives along so you can see what my problems are!
You just wrote
I want to order a red Tesla, the highest performance model,

...and hurry before I get up and change my mind.
Even inanimate objects remind me of her.
If I am not mistaken, that is the same pen my mother used to write on my face.
Lately I feel like I've been chewed up and spat out.
This is no bed of roses, buddy boy.
My mother used to crochet, do you think that means anything?
How did you figure out I hate red?
Doc, they tell me everything I touch goes into the red.
Yes my wife doesn't underst........just a minute you are supposed to be on the couch not me & 'I ' ask YOU the questions!!
some do. some don't. frankly, I have been tempted to join you.
So you have a kissing phobia.
I guess you never got over it too,that your wife kissed another guy.
Hey Doc, can we switch chairs? This one reminds me of her.
I prefer white myself...
Doc, I hate to wake you up, but the clock is running.
Why do this from a love seat? Lack of love is my problem!
Mother not only belittled me, she behaved so ravishingly in the process.
Are you sure your lips are sealed?
My mother would prefer a different couch.
Is this from the new 'Kylie Couch Kit'?
Tell me I’m not projecting.
Of course I can't move forward. The jelly is stuck to my suit.
The snooze couch works again like a big soft kiss.
Doc you know red is an aggressive color is this your confrontational session?
We've spent half the session in each role: is it easier to be repressed there?
For some reason, I only use such... colorful language when I'm here with you
I have this weird attachment to lips.
With rare exceptions, I skip the fiction.
It's cozy, but I still miss Steve Bannon.
I've told you already - I dwell on the past because it is so much nicer than the present
Listen Doc, you're one sick Dude if you think that I'll confess my sexual problems with my wife to you now!
I can't stop feeling like I'm on the verge of being devoured by my ex-wife's big mouth.
stand still like this, I'm almost done
I know I want everybody to kiss my but, I was hoping it would stop here.
it takes more than two to figure out one
I feel like I'm about to be swallowed up by everything I touch...
I think you misspelled 'genius'.
I did not have sex with that woman!
My mother always wore this shade and it frightened me.



Neil Philbin, Wakefield RI
For some reason you seem consumed by the thought of her
I can do blue if you like.
I read that her furniture line sold out in minutes.
And THEN he posted a screen grab of my tweet for everyone to seee, with the comment 'that's hilarious', and left the chat group...
Something is nagging me to accept derivative pop art.
What makes you think everything I tell you is just lip service?
This session inspires me to kiss and make up.
And YOUR Gufram fetish started when-Doctor?
Will liposuction help?
I always feel like I am being swallowed up.
Is this going to cost me dearly?
I hope you disinfected this thing before you brought it in here. I've got enough issues without having an STD.
I'm an accountant stuck in puzzle 666.  Am I Satan on a red couch that will devour me or am I  an angel to be saved by these red lips?
I've been feeling... Rocky
Doc, stop paying lip service to me.
I’m just glad to see her.
I feel most of what I say is lip service.
I feel enveloped by an aura of Lip Ivo.
Where I come from, a man does his own upholstery.
This is really nice but do you have to watch?
And then I heard him say 'Beam me up Scotty!'
It is comfortable but you're going to have to wait your turn.
I sure hope you aren't writing that I have an anal complex as well...
Mom claimed I could always lean on her, and I began to believe it.
I said lies come out your mouth, not lie on my mouth
Everything I touch turns blue.
You were recommended by my good friends, Mick and Steven.
Before I began my analysis, life seemed so drab.
But remember I only gave lip service to that arrangement.
Is this couch that's like the  artist William DeKooning's painting of  Mae  West's lips  a freudian joke
My indebtedness worries me.
This Craigslist couch smells like ass.
Yes, I love everybody but myself.
I don't charge for lip service!
It all started with this red lipstick on my collar.
Wrong lips!!!  I don't need anymore sweet talking.
Should I be subliminally stimulated to discuss my love life?
At what age do you think your "lipstick phobia" began?
Am I bleeding?
You're uncomfortable with the lips. Maybe if you closed your eyes, it would help.
Do you have a couch that's more in season?
After I met her, everything looks like her red lips!
Pucker up, it's going to be a long session!
You asked "How's that working for you"?
It must be working. I never thought of myself as having good taste.
Sorry, wasn't listening. This couch reminds me of 
the 'Lips between the Hips' mantra.
...it seems my confidence of self-expression has evaporated, EnVeloPed in a Panacea Perceiving softness on these stiff anonnomous red comfort lips so aptly offered to extend pseudo support to my enmeshed senses of Oy Vey muffled in a pre-fab suit.
I don’t see you writing it down,” the man complained. 

“Well, you’ve already mentioned it 16 times in the last 45 minut—“

“I don’t think you appreciate just how distracting this giant red lips couch is. PUT IT ON THE FUCKING NOTEPAD, JERRY.
She found last session's lipstick stains particularly hurtful...
How can I trust you? I thought you said your lips were sealed.
A written privacy policy form would have been sufficient.
You want to hear the colorful version?
Kiss me quick, before I fall asleep.
For the first time in a long time, I like I can finally exhale.
I just feel like you could liven up a little bit.
However, I do find your turtleneck rather professional.
This really isn't my shade, let's try black and blue which my father's favorite.
Every time I lay on this couch, I think Cardi B is kissing me all over.
When did you first feel you were paying 'lip service' to my role as an analyst?
Lay off Killer. Our PR has been terrible since Jaws.
I've been studying and practicing bushcraft and primitive technology for the last 20 years or so. I'll be fine.
I’m fine, how are you?
This couch looks like a lip.
I suppose I can try for every day, but I'm partying at least once a week as it is.
It’s spelled s-u-i-c-i-d-e!
I feel like your therapy is just lip service.
Watching David Lynch movies certianly has been no help.
I tried, Primal Scream Therapy.  My wife said why not try Kiss A Boo Boo And Make It Better?
That's mother with a capital M.
Doctor,I have this recurring dream about being kissed ...
Now that I think of it, Mama’s kisses were suffocating!
Have you ever read “The Giver?”
My wife also gave me a Hummer for Fathers' Day .
I feel I could open up with Mies Van der Rohe.
These remind me of your mother's lips.
I feel like everyone I meet is just paying me lip service.
Are you still keeping notes on paper?
I don't know, Sam.  You and I may be going too far into our father-son relationship.
I love red doctor, but I'm not a Communist!
Do you mind if I move the pillow to the other end of the couch? I don't like people to notice that I'm losing some hair.
I was dormant but lying here I feel sore.
I acquiesce - give in to everything. I've lost my bite!
Stop eyeballing me!
Can I have some "Gummy Bears", please?
Must I "kiss and tell"?
I'm in love with the Rolling Stones
You never answered the question I asked when I came in, so I’ll ask again: What that mouth do?
I don't know, maybe going polychromatic was a bit too flashy after all
She walked out on my two years ago, but I still see her luscious lips everywhere I go...
Yes, the couch is shaped by a pair of lips.  Does that remind you of anyone?
Therapy is “Kiss my ass?”
My husband likes Dali too but I've drawn a line in my office.
How did you know that dry lips were a major concern of mine?
Now tell me again why this couch makes you think about your mother.
To be clear; I want more than lip service today.
Table or no, Doc, I can't escape the feeling that I'M on the menu.
I know you say it
Doctor, are those Allbirds?
I told you Doc, ever since I came to your office I can't get her big lips out of my mind.
You must think I’m balmy!
What's my best odd: 'Should I love her or leave her?'
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your...
I feel like you’re more focused on the couch.
So... call it a hunch, but that's a Quaaludes prescription you're writing there, isn't it, Doc?
I feel better now that I am not a complete unknown
REALLY? Well, you can kiss my ass, too!
I *do* think this is helping me with my intimacy issues!
Opening your third eye is going to be harder than I thought.
I keep dreaming that I'm being swallowed by her love.
Is this couch just a couch or are you a Freudian psychiatrist?
In typical psychoanalytic fashion, the only lips that are moving in this session, are the couch’s, as the patient squirms in awkward “therapeutic” silence.
I asked for my secretary and not a stenographer.
I am glad we swapped  places, as the couch was  starting to look like botoxed red lips and I was getting these sexual fantasies.
Not good. I tend to feel like a cold sore during a game of spin the bottle.  So no, this isn't helping much.
I can’t get the expression “Lips smacking good!” out of my mind.
It all goes back to my Maw.
Mother always wore red lipstick.  She was an artist.  That's why I'm here.
Patient: "Doctor, if this is wrong, I don't want to be right"
Doctor: "Right..."
Yes, I do crave a tongue sandwich! Can I get that with mustard on rye?
Now that I've been to your washroom, I'm not sure "Freudian stages" is really the best theme for your décor...
Do you think maybe you need to talk to somebody?
So love means never having to say you are sorry??
The color red always makes me homicidal.
And then she called it all off, claiming I was incapable of appreciating lips.
I've never been kissed by a real person, you see.
Loose lips make tights knits
Sometimes I put my Foot in my mouth, sometimes more.
Sometimes it feels like you’re just giving me lip service...
I don't see color. I just see people.
Just roll over and close your eyes.
I'm sorry but I always get Dali and the Dalai Lama mixed up.
What would you take for this couch?
I feel like i'm in a psychiatric bordello.
Honestly this whole thing just feels like lip service.
I'm getting a hard-on from your new couch!
But my wife don't want to have sex on red bedroom
You know, it’s the science behind elevators that has always fascinated me.
DEAD
DR. SHYAMALAN, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK YOU'RE HINTING AT SOMETHING.
In case you're interested, my mother's lipstick was Chanel red - not this drugstore imitation.
You took, “She dreams in color, she dreams in red,” pretty literally here, Doc.
Is red my only choice?
I don’t know what it is Doc, but every time I come here I feel an obsessive oral fixation.
Number of the beast...
Sometimes, I feel you're just kissing up to me.
Sometimes I feel like a clam ...other times I feel like two lips...
. . . pink cener on the filet, not red . . .
I have a feeling my mother breast-fed me too long.
Oh ,don't forget that we're also out of potato chips.
''You won't use this is in your next advertisement, will you?''
I feel like I'm being smooched all over!!!
Doc, I feel like you're just giving me lip service.
As interesting as a piece of furniture?  I wish
Bob...Stop overthinking it. KISS keep it simple stupid
Your new LIP Couch makes me want to tell you everything!
Yes, doctor, I feel like we've made a lot of progress today.
Two for one ... psychotherapy and liposuction ... I'm in. Let's do it.
Must I romanticize my responses?
What is this "red" of which you speak?
We need to stop meeting like this
Are you sure your couch is not going to swallow me?
Sometimes I feel you are saying to me
This is contest number 666.  Are you satan?
No, I haven't considered drinking more Grey Goose. Why do you ask?
....but I’ll settle for being as interesting and thought-provoking as this couch. Or is that setting my goal too high?
Doc, this isn't really what I had in mind when you said 'liposuction'
You know this couch should be set against a solid wall.
I also think I’m suddenly developing an oral fixation.”
Why do her words keep coming out of my mouth?
Do you have anything to eat? I'm STARVING!
Yes, I do like having my butt kissed!
My goodness, is this a surrealist jam session?
I'm not comfortable speaking before her.
Strange. I feel like I'm in  Buss.
I'm not the kiss and tell type if that's where your heading doc.
You know what the Yankees are doing?
I’m reminded of The Stones.
I’m sorry. I 
can’t make sense of this, either.
She became upset when I told her the relationship leaves me feeling like I'm about to be swallowed up!
Doc, I’m starting to think you’re the one with the oral fixation.
‘You took the words straight out of my moutb’
Why did I ever think Trump was something more than an ass hole?
Here's a little sugar for your bowl.
I can’t stop obsessing about a vacation in the Poconos
So I forgot to bring my reusable bags...
Did you just pass gas?
My mother wore this shade of lipstick, you bastard.
For once, I appreciate your lip service!
Could the lip stick damage my suit?
How much longer will it take for me to get out of the oral phase?
Your guess is as good as mine, Doctor.
Why do I get the feeling that I'm only goin to get lip service?
XYZ,Check. Your Zipper
I thought I was the one with the oral fixation.
As they say, “Loose lips sink ships”.
No,my mother did NOT wear red lipstick.  Why?
That was an hour? Wow! Time just melted away.
I feel consumed by penis envy.
I feel like such a mouthful when I visit.
I don't know why, but I could kiss you right now.
And thank you for letting my girl friend accompany me.
You know Frank, buying your wife a CPAP Machine would be much cheaper.
Do you have a blanket, it’s a little chilly.
I hope I don't leave this appointment with a bad taste in my mouth
Don’t give me any Lip!
Why yes- I am having trouble sleeping
Ain't you uncomfortable sitting in that chair for so long, I think you need to talk.
I'm getting warm,is this couch heated?
Yes, I think I do have trouble showing affection.  Do you, Doc?
Are you sure you want to hear about the companion piece?
Everyone I know just kisses my ass.
Come on Doc.  Why do I feel that you are totally giving me lip service this session?
What makes you think I have an Oedipal Complex?
She kept warning me how she would chew me up and spit me out.
Having  sex with the other sex is just repulsive to me. I don't know why.
Doc, you know I don't like being seen after the oral fixation patient...
Lipstick on my collar told a tale on me.
And I said 'Paint me like one of your french girls' and he said- Hey, would you stop drawing and listen to me?
I’ve been rather obsessed with kissing lately.
Lipstick therapy works with men, too... right?
So Doc, you really think my lip fetish is temporary?
Now that I think about it, it was definitely love at first kiss.
'
I hate this 'lipstick' couch, I'm wondering why you chose it?
Have you been listening or just too busy playing with yourself?
What do these Freudian lips mean?
Her cherry lips surprised me, an innocent young man....
How do I make up?
look, you seem great, but are you sure you're the right doctor to treat my specific issue, Involuntary Couch Fucking Disorder?
Is this a metaphor for all the lip your clients give you?
I find this couch too narrow for two people - what is wrong with me
Lay it on me.  My lips are sealed.
Is there some Freudian explanation for why I have to withstand the indignity of reclining between lipsticked lips?
So you think I have oral issues, as well as a hidden love of makeup?
Is  it hot in here or am I crazy?
These lips embrace me. Will they open, chew and swallow soon?
You have bee's knees, I have C's knees that make me sneeze. See what I mean? I rhyme all the time and it's making me crime.
I understand your specialty is curing the blues.
this has brought me great comfort ever since bobby got human centipeded
Well dressed, well spoken...
I have the moves like Jagger, but still, nothing seems right.
Ya, my love life hasn't been going that well, a girl got her lip stick all over my back.
Be honest... is that chair tacky?
What happens in the champagne bathtub?!
Frankly, I'm starting to question your slogan: "a moment on the lips, an eternity of having come to grips."
I'll take an E
I did say that, Doctor, but it was just a Freudian lip.
My mother wears this shade when she disrespects my boundaries.
I think this really helps doc, when I´m here my life feels more... colorful.
You are doing only lip service.
I'm not sure why, but somehow I just feel like saying, ''Kiss my ass!''
Lip service!  Lip Service!  15 years and all I've gotten is Lip Service!
I wonder why my neck hurts after each session
Mick Jagger makes me want to blow you.
I don't want to win this week's caption contest, and you liberals can stick it.
No, why do you ask, Dr. Pucker?
After three years of analysis, I begin to discover colors.
hey doc, you ever feel like someone is out there just "captioning" every word you say?
You've kept me waiting a long time.
My feelings about that, for some reason, seem pursed.
Everyone I choose.   I'm a hot mess.
Yes, now you've got it. It goes like that. Simple, eh?
Well you see Doc, I just feel people are always talking about me. Like my actions are constantly on their lips.
This couch is really read for no reason.
You acquired a new couch after I mentioned my obsession with baci ball?
And then I roll over and she opens her mouth, and then I always wake up....
Hey doc did you notice the current contest # ?
Like I’ve been telling you;
It’s the kiss of death.
These lips never lie.
It is X rated
It may seem transference on my part, but did your mother also display a strong preference for red lipstick?
I guess that you have heard all about ass kissing.
I have been feeling more love.
Did you mean to say 'couch'' or was that a Freudian Lip?
The unrealistic beauty standards you've set for the world are just a projection of your own insecurities.
Kiss and tell?  Kiss and tell?  That’s your solution!?!
Thanks for hosting these bach(elor) sessions, doc.
Sorry George, I guess I’m OK with a “LIFE COACH”... not a “LOVE COUCH”...
Doctor, the curve of your lips is leaving me aching.
I'm surrounded by lips, Doctor."
"Well, you might have an oral fixation."
"I meant this couch.
I keep having these vivid dreams of Mick Jagger...
I really think my anxieties pre-date the #metoo thing. In my dreams, it's always 1937, and then I wake up.
I know it was her red lipstick that drove me crazy
You don't need to write this down.  I really don't want to kill anybody.
Never thought I'd be sitting on somebody's lip.
Sometimes I feel like your just to forward Dave.
Suddenly, I find myself in the mood for love.
Something about the taste of his lips
just did not put me on a ride
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  This couch is swallowing me.
And then she said "you complete me".
Speaking of a Freudian s-lip.
This “Poconos immersion therapy” is not squelching my fear of  kitsch.
So the couch is indicative of your empathy for the Me Too movement?
Mr. Larkin,  Let's remember who the psychiatrist is.
I have this uncontrollable urge to change my lipstick color.
Fixations as furniture is an interesting concept, but I'd stop here."
I'm here because you were  recommended to help me with my obsessive rumination on the phrase: "Loose lips sink ships"
I suppose I am upset about the overuse of mood-ring technology. Why do you ask?
...and then Mick Jagger appeared out of nowhere...
So that veggie cartoon scarred me for life.
Don’’t forget the fries!
So you really think it’s buns I’m obsessed with?
Why is it I always want to dissect my issues from the early 70’s!
Oddly, my recent dreams all have my mother starring in a movie directed by Warhol--with a Rolling Stones soundtrack
I told you on the phone I had a thing about the Rolling Stones
I just feel like everything around me is changing. When did you get this couch?
You know? I think these sessions are giving me lip.
My life is as chapped as my lips
Your couch feels like Freudian lips.
I know that my love life is a mess, but this red hot lip couch is not helping.
I have a real problem with red lipstick
How could you know that huge, red lips are my problem?
I didn't know you took  Costco cards. So I get 2 hours, right?
Patient to doctor : “I hardly ever ope my lips. Simonides, what think ye of my rule ?”
Reply: If you are a wise man I think you are a fool. If you are a fool, I think you are very wise.....!”
Don't take it so seriously...I was just lip-synching!
My wife's are not as well-maintained and I think that's the reason why I'm here.
The inspiration for my office were my childhood memories of my mother
I feel so bland and understated for your couch!
I'm sorry Dr. Morris, did you just say, "Feed me, Morris"?
Every time I think of it, I see red!
She only pays lip-service to my issues...
I think I felt the change about the time red became the new black
…And no, I wasn’t paying lip service when I said those things about your skills as a therapist.
The relationship was improving, but then she wanted to know why I had lipstick all over my suit...
Not your typical lip job.
Was it your love of Mae West or Dali that drove you to psychiatry?
I'd really like to get to the bottom of my recurring dream of being swallowed by a pair of big read lips.
Say, this sofa reminds me of mother's pe- LIPS. My mother's lips
But enough about me. For some reason, I feel like I have to share some insights into the life of Brad Pitt.
No, for some reason I just can't forget her beautiful lips."
I feel like I have a kissing disorder
So I politely suggested "hey, maybe you shouldn't just grab the mic from their hands" and ended up with an almond milkshake in face.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't understand it, Doc. Lately I've been having the most outrageous oral fantasies.
Sir, this is a shoe shop.
I don't think this is helping with my mother issues.
By the way, your mother is proud of you.
I stay awake all night worrying that I am going color blind.
I just can't shake the feeling that Number of the Beast is floating over me head!
So tell me...what dat mouth do?
Good, Mr. Soze: now expand on what you mean when you say your wife giving you lip is couching a larger issue.
For some strange reason I keep thinking about science fiction double features during our sessions.
hi i was told to come to this website to buy some runescape membership and bonds
Doc, everywhere I go a giant pair of lips are trying to eat me.
I've just lost my Mojo...
It all started with a Kylie Jenner Lip Kit...
This projection couch isn't working, doc.
The voices tell me a blue couch would be nicer.
My lips are sealed just say whatever is on your mind
Lip a dee do dah, lip a dee day.  Sing it!
This couch is so alien to a psychologist's office that I feel like I'm getting an entirely different type of probe!
I just see everything in black and white but when I'm here in your office you really just help light up the room."
So I said to her, ‘You look like a trollop with that bright red lipstick!’
I'm straight, but I'm running in a gay district.
Tell me in what way does my couch remind you of your mother?
I have dreams at night that I'm being engulfed by a pair of huge red lips.  What does that mean?
Is the stiletto chair on back order?
It feels like my whole life is on exhibition.
Did you remember to add to your notes,that i haven't had lips like these,since Mother died.
I keep seeing Rolling Stones imagery, doc, you gotta help me!
I really need your help.  I am a compulsive womanizer.
Is this a joke, Doctor?”
“No, just a Freudian’s lip.
If only lips could talk....
I am "reddy" to proceed and even brought my own colour coordinated couch.  Do you think I have a problem?
I feel as though you want to kiss me but don't dare come right out and say so.
I feel like a giant pair of red lips are about to swallow me whole.
Is this your not-so-subtle way to get me to open up?
I feel compelled to keep it simple.
Just writing an old adage-“From your lips to God’s ears.”
I thought you said you wanted to paint me like one of your French girls?
I feel like I'm being dominated by my Mother, and these sessions have't been helping.
Honey, is this a couch built for two?
No, it's not just lip service.
I am fairly certain you share my opinion that the Me Too movement falls into the fake news category.
Sometimes I just feel like I'm lying on somebody's lips. I don't understand it, Joe.
Listen doc, I've got a serious problem.
I've been listening to nothing but Queen for 30 years. No other genre, no other band, nothing but Queen. Every word to every song to every album memorized. Even in silence, their songs play nonstop in my head.
I remember doing the Time Warp
You see it wasn't her plus size or kisses...on the contrary...I was drawing for joy in all those wet lustful zoftig kisses...it was the nightmares ...all those stupid dreams of being masticated by some big red whale...
It’s like I’m being eaten alive
I hope that I’ll have enough time with you. Somehow I feel that this session will be rather short, over in a lickety split of time.
Did you just call me hors d 'oeuvre?​
Just plain nuts.
I don’t do psychoanalysis. I do kiss and tell.
Your launch is the kiss...
I can only see the color blue.
No Mont Blanc?
Could you hand me that apple?
I feel your just paying lip service to my shattered psyche
$300 per session for this kind of lip service?
I wonder what couch you use for the next stage of my development?
And this is meant to help my oral fixation?
No, I don't feel like kissing you. Where'd you get an idea like that?
In my dream she keeps saying that I'm "lip-smacking good."
I feel like I'm par-tic-i-pating in our sessions.
....and then I... hated when she kissed me.
That was my best bedtime story yet!
Does this mean that my analysis will be one great prolonged kiss?
I don't care if it's your alma mater's team color, it's driving me crazy.
You mentioned you're familiar with Oedipal Complex issues?
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transexual, Transylvania
I am afraid I am becoming a couch french fry.
I feel like I'm not in Kansas anymore.
Mae I stay silent
My lips are sealed
Perhaps we would make more progress on my Oedipus Complex, if I could sit in the chair.
I dreamed that I was swallowed alive by a she-goddess.
So, doctor, your thinking is that all our issues go back to our mother’s all-consuming love?
It's not Mick Jagger but it'll do.
Are You Taking Good Notes?
It’s Freudian slip, not lips
Do you recycle the notes after you shred them?
Do stop me if I mouth off too much.
But mostly it’s your couch that really chaps my ass.
It's as if the universe has become one big maw sucking the life out of me.
You know, Doc, it was a lush set of red lips that got me into this emotional state in the first place.
May I confide something, or are you part of the display?
Loose lips sink slips?
Dear doctor... I had the strangest dream about lying .. in state ... on this sexy sofa, mmm.
To be honest, I only wanted to salve my conscience
How did you 
know I was lippy?
How can you be knitting while I'm being kissed to death?
My teeth feel dirty.
The lips don
This sofa is so my mother.
“Dr., maybe I have philematophobia ...”
I get no kick from champagne...
No the couch does not remind me of my mother.
I don’t know what happened, doc, I swear I was goin’ for the Cincinnati Steamer.
Recently, I have made some poor upholstery color recommendations.
... and about how long have you been experiencing these overwhelming sexual fantasies?
I’ve been feeling rather eames-less until now.
I first went to my doctor and she said I was suffering from no one cares itis
Note to self: Replace carbon monoxide sensor
I'm Rhett, and I was referring to Scarlett O'Hara.
Thanks for trying to help me forget about her, but she used botox.
Wherever I go I'm the only man wearing a tie.
This couch is giving me an oral fixation.
Really, I’ just looking for a quiet place to nap.
Father always wore Chanel Rouge Allure in Pirate
Is this really how we are supposed to discuss my E.D. Problem?
Am I being held in Mick's or Chaka's lips?
Nope! I don't think it's possible to come up with a caption without using the 'R' word.
So you acknowledge the lip service really put a kink in your relationship?
Do daydreams count?
My lips may be red but my thoughts are blue.
Favorite Spielberg movie? Probably "Hook". Yours?
Never heard of a "mood" couch, just the mood ring. Interesting...
This chair makes me feel like you are trying to hard Doc.”
Now is really not the time to tell me you have a lip fetish.
Yes, I'm quite certain my nightmares about my wife becoming a black widow spider recur each night after I meet with you.
She did our’s too, but in purple.
If this is your method, I’m keeping the giant trash compactor dream to myself.
Doc, thanks for doing a house call. I sat on the cat, and I don’t know how to break it to my wife.
Shes gonna leave me if she finds out my businees is in the red
So, tell me again about this death dream.
I love the sofa, cause my mother always said my lips were too small for my face!
hey ,wanna go out for a drink after this?
I’ve been dreaming about lips a lot.
I'm sorry, but frankly I just don't feel comfortable sharing all these intimate details of my life with a stranger.
What time does the tongue come out?
Yes, lip service costs more.
Yes,  I know I can always get what I want. Is that your best material?
Your hypnosis to get me over the breakup still hasn’t worn off...
Ever since I started counseling, the song "Ruby Red Lips" has been playing in my head.  Why do you think that is doctor?
I don't know what it is, but this couch always reminds me of her.
Doctor, I’m so glad you don’t just give lip service to your patients.
I think I'm ready for my blue period.
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
No one ever asks about MY bottom line.
Then he called me Coo Coo McCool. And I was a long time Democrat office holder just ready to retire when he fired me."
This isn't quite what I had in mind when I asked for lip-service.
Have all my problems filled that notebook of yours yet?
I feel like my mother loved me too much.
I asked for a blue sofa
I have recurring dreams that I’m being swallowed up by the “me too”  generation
No peeking until your unconscious hides.

Since working with you, my dreams have been unusually sensuous.
What does it mean if I’m craving tongue?
My friends call her a man-eater but I don't see it.
Knit one...pearl two...
What IS the symbology of these lips?
You know doctor, this couch kinda reminds me of my mother.
What do I owe you for these sessions?

It's no use doc- I see sex everywhere.
I need some rest, let us switch

I was hoping for a therapist with a tad more gloss.
I like the couch Joe, but really, “Kiss and Tell Counseling”? How gauche!
I let her make the first move.
I can’t do this. It reminds me too much of her.

Could I lie on the jungle red shade instead?
At this moment, I feel love.

Sorry doctor, but is it true what they say about psychiatrists ?
Some days I feel like her passionate embrace will simply consume me.
Don't give me that lip service Doc.
I just don’t think a ‘Casting Couch’ is very helpful since you’ve told me that I need to stop trying to ‘act’ strong all the time.

A Gin & Tonic, no lime please
I have an itch. Please scratch my back
I can't seem to shake this feeling of wanting to be kissed.

These sessions are the most colorful part of my week.

And where do you think this new fear of being eaten alive has come from?
May I draw you like one of my french girls?
So how is my therapy centered on this love seat and why is it critical that I pay for it ?
No, I've never read the giver.
They call it a “Talk Couch”. What ever is on your mind, just let it roll off your lips.
This couch makes me feel like I could be
swallowed if that's your intent.
I obsess about voluptuous women eating me.
It’s the oddest thing, doc. Since my last visit, I keep having this dream I’m being swallowed whole by Mick Jagger.

I never considered I might taste like  aged beef.
I keep dreaming of cold sores.
So, are you telling me that I don't think enough about sex?
Lying on this red-lipped shape couch Doc has as brought back all my abhorrent sex fantasies. Better get a full sized steno pad quick!
Don't worry, Doc. I haven't touched liquor in years.
Normally I don't feel comfortable confiding in someone with loose lips.
kiss and tell
I don't know. I just can't stop thinking of her ruby red lips.
Quit the stirring and don't give me any lip, Doc.
Am I boring you?
My mood couch is telling me you're not feeling cool as a cucumber.
Tell me again about these "colors" you've been seeing.
Why yes, I am a Freudian; how ever did you guess?
Look, I really appreciate you trying but we really don’t do the whole ‘red thing’ here.
Beauty of one's problem lies in its feeds to another's wallet.
You say you understand me, but I can't help feeling this is all just lip service.
If feel like you're hinting that I'm paying lip service to your suggestions.
And ever since, if I so much as think of a pair of oversized lips, straightaway I’m seized by the paranoid delusion that my hemorrhoids have begun to bleed.

You're not getting Randy anymore, Doc.
I've been having some strange dreams about Mae West. They seemed to have popped out of nowhere.

My only associations are  "Loose lips sink ships"
Doc, I feel like my life’s a joke. Specifically, ‘What’s black and white and red all over?’
So which one was Jayne Mansfield, then?
So you consul the Jenner's, I think this will be our last appointment
Doc, ever since I've been coming here, I've had a recurring dream of being eaten.
Remember that old black-and-white horror movie "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman?"   She chases me every night in my dreams . . . but she's wearing bright red lipstick.
Do you smell perfume?
I left my credit card at the bar—name of J. Prufrock.
I hope this new lip service
You couldn't spell CAJ if I spotted you the C and the J.
I still don't feel the affection of others though.
When I'm good, I'm very, very good. It's surreal!
There it is again, the strange sensation of a tongue licking down my back!
Does this couch induce conversation  ?
I used to see everything in black and white; now all I feel is red.
What am I thinking?  Loveseat Lips, Hugh Hefner, somebody has an identity crisis, likes Playboy, or lives for alliterations.
I hope you have a good supply of pencils and pads.
On the plus side, since I started coming here I don't feel like I'm in everyone's lips anymore
Doctor, I can’t stop thinking about her ruby  red lips, and I don’t know why.
I'm trying to be sweeter.
To be honest, I don't believe a word out of you lips.
Lip Service .....
I dunno. I feel like everyone's giving me lip.
So, in this dream, I'm being eaten
...and then she said, "why don't you find a window to jump out of".
Are you sure this couch is suitable given my orientation?
Strange.  I dreamt last night of lipstick, and how long it's been."
Well, I kissed  her and then told all my buddies.
Well, I feel awkward discussing my love life now.
You must get a lot of comments on this couch of yours. Where’d you get the idea from, Dr. Luna?”


Paul Bergman
New York, New Yor
I hear you also got the Apple PRODUCT(RED) iPhone.
I've grown accustomed to her face.
This couch has the shape and color of my wife’s lips, Bill, does that have any meaning for our session?
Mr. Richards explained, "I can't get no satisfaction"
In the nightmares, I'm falling for Mick Jagger.
I feel like I’m in a time warp.
This wonderfully engulfed feeling of passion has me intrigued”.


Christine Constantine
Annapolis Md
This couch reminds me of my mother.
Maybe it’s you, Doc, who needs to examine his preoccupation with sex?
I feel like these sessions aren't helping my oral fixation.
Don't worry . . . it won't swallow you . . .
Is it Oedipal if I keep feeling my mother's lips on mine.
Ewww. Something keeps sticking its tongue my ear.
That’s The Big Lebowski sweater.
Doctor, you look shocked.
The couch is to create a visual aid.
I feel trapped in the kiss of death.
Call me paranoid but, somehow,  I feel this is all predetermined.
This sofa is really comfotable, what do you think of that?
you think she was just paying me lip service????
I had a dream that my mother was wearing shades of coral. I’m conflicted.
These sessions are not helping my oral fixations.”
I understand your couch was a gift from the manufacturer of botox.
What I have to say mustn't pass your lips.
I’m not here to pay for lip service.
Oral fixation? ...me?
Every night after I come here I dream that some women are whispering terrible things about me.
I know it's ridiculous, Doc, but it feels like someone's making a meal of me.
How can I help it if I'm pouty?
I love the name Mylo. I want to name my kid Mylo, my dog Mylo. I want to marry a Mylo.. I also need to make a living, so I'm thinking about creating an app called MyLo - short for My Location. You mentioned you know Mark Zuckerberg?
Is this your passive way of asking me for more 'lip service' Doc?
This couch is exactly my mom's lipstick shade of red.
Do you do politics?
Can we use a different couch? This one reminds me of my mother for some reason.
I feel strangely aroused during my sessions.
My wife says I have an inferiority complex.
It's a nice effort doc, but I still have a fear of being eaten by a giant.
How I feel is uncomfortable, from sitting on this couch.
What do you mean, I've got an oral fixation?
Why do you think I have oral fixation issues?
This might sound crazy Dr. Canoodle, but every since you redecorated your office, I've been getting a feeling of warmth, a sense of love, acceptance, a renewed need for closeness and caring, even stirrings of passion, a desire..."








canppodl
She thinks I don’t appreciate things of great value.
My wife says I'm manipulative and need to be here for at least an hour.  So, please don't forget to wake me in one hour.
Sorry
I feel that nobody understands me and are just giving me lip service."
Are you just paying lip service?
All of your therapy has been just lip service to my ego.
Look, Doc, you’re projecting your oral fixation on me, and it’s really chappin’ my ass.
Have I mentioned I was a bull fighting bull in my previous life? Red is not a good color for me.
Have you ever noticed that women are sexier wearing red lipstick?
“So, I’m obsessed with the Rolling Stones and anal retentive. Do you really think this couch is going to help?”
Just sort of thought I would have moved out of the oral stage by now.
Are we bound to keep repeating the sins of our fathers?
I let my lips do the talking.
Can we compromise on yellow upholstery?
Do we have to kiss afterwards?
It started out innocent, Doc. I liked the normie stuff. But then my buddy sent me some really dank, deep-fried memes — they changed me. It's gotten so bad, I can't even laugh unless I'm looking at a distorted image of Bugs Bunny saying the n-word.
It’s chilly. Could you get me a blanket?
and then she got mad at me cause i said she had "crusty" lips
I am a sphynx.
If you’re ordering lunch I’ll have a tongue sandwich.
It's like winning this caption contest is fulfilling biblical prophecy! Did I mention I like your lips couch?
I just feel like my therapist really wants to kiss me
Care to join me, dear?

I have a fear of being bitten by a couch.
How does that make you feel?

I'm sorry somebody took a whole bite of you.
Oh, go eff yourself, Doctor. Thanks! I'm feeling better. See you next week!

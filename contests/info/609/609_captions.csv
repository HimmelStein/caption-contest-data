He really did appoint Chris Christie as Secretary of Transportation.
We can take this and transfer to the BLT at 42nd
You rarely see heroes in the subway anymore
Next stop, New Deli.
Why does everything look like food when I am on a diet?
Let’s wait for the next train. Something’s not kosher with this one.
I think we're at the wrong Subway
I’m just relieved Subway outbid Trojan.
You realize you’ve just wasted your last wish, don’t you?
Budget cuts, service cuts, now, cold cuts?
Let's catch the next one. I hate being sandwiched in.
I don't care, it's on time and we're taking it.
Next stop is the Mayo Clinic.
It's on time but it's not what I ordered
What's next? The gravy train?
If it touches the third rail it's toasted
Let's wait for the club car.
I'm going to need a moment to digest this.
It looks packed. Let's wait for the BLT.
If it touches the third rail it's toasted
They did say it would take a hero to fix the MTA...
No, dear, that's the 12. We want the six.
Should we take this one or wait for the BLT?
The sign did say subway.
This is inbound. Trust me, you don't want to see outbound.
The regular train broke down so they had to bring in a sub.
I thought we had a ticket to rye.
Yes, dear, it's a chew chew train.
It's packed. Let's hail a taco.
I think we're at the wrong Subway
We must have read the map wrong. Looks like we're on the digestive track.
Let's wait. There's a vegan option directly behind this one.
Does 'If You See Something, Say Something' apply here?
Wanna take this or wait for the lo-cal?
And at that moment, Natalie used the word 'literally' correctly for the first time.
Looks like the president has moved on to infrastructure.
It's final destination is what worries me.
If you say, "Lettuce in," one more time...
I love this city. If you miss a visual metaphor another will be along in five minutes.
It's either this or hail a cabbage.
You did say it would take a hero to fix the MTA....
Let’s wait for the next one. I hate being sandwiched in.
I’m trying to avoid fast food.
Let’s catch the next one. This one’s got everything on it.
Don't call it a hoagie or they'll know you're a tourist.
Not that one. It's loaded with transit fats.
That explains the rats.
If that’s the sub car, let’s get out of here before the bullet train arrives.
This whole product placement advertising thing is getting out of control.
You're sure he said to take the BLT to Brooklyn?
After 9 rides, the 10th one is free!
Wait for the vegetarian, it's less crowded.
Next stop--the Mayo Clinic!
Oh good, a dining car.
Let's take the next train. I just ate.
Let's wait for the gravy train.
We finally found the sub-station.
Did you know that the B, L, and T lines had merged?
Let’s wait. This one looks a little seedy.
I love the new meds we are taking!
No, lets wait for one with no mayo.
I'm gonna wait for one without onions.
Impressive, yep. But you should see the station in Hamburg.
Chris Christie must be in town again
I've got a ticket to Rye.
That's the white bread to the Upper East Side. We want to the whole wheat to Brooklyn.
I love what they've done with the club car.
This isn't what I meant when I said "Let's take a Subway home."
And somehow, it still smells like urine.
I expect the next one will be a whopper.
This happens all the time in New York; someone falls on the tracks, then someone else becomes a big hero.
Let's wait, this doesn't look kosher.
Siri, I meant the closest subway train.
I heard there were delays on the BLT.
That's the BLT. The IRT comes in three minutes.
No, wait. This is going to Philly.
I knew Cuomo's MTA improvement plan was bologna.
Let's wait for the BLT.
Just be glad we're not in Philadelphia.
So it's true - a hero really did jump onto the tracks this morning.
They did say to expect delis.
That's not going to help the rat problem.
When did New York get so literal?
They say the first week of Atkins is always the toughest.
That's the BLT, we want the BMT.
Let's wait. I think the 4:17 comes with fries and a pickle.
Now, that's fast food!
I hate to state the obvious, but this is the wrong subway
Stand clear of the closing dough.
The first 5 days without gluten are always the hardest.
This is a substation?
OK, in this case you may use the word "literally."
Is this the IRT or the BLT?
Let's wait for one that doesn't have everything on it.
Of course it is fast food. This is the express line.
Are you sure this is the lo-cal?
Look, the new line from Philly is in.
That’s not ours honey, that’s the twelve.Ours is the six.
Wait. The next one might come with pickles.
That's the pastrami to Rye.
Happens a lot in New York; someone falls on the tracks, then instantly someone else turns into a hero.
You take 9 rides and get the 10th for free.
Did you ask Alexa for Subway again?
Yep...this is Philly....
Let's wait for the next train. I don't feel like getting sandwiched in.
Because the joke doesn’t work, darling, if you call it a hoagie.
I guess we missed the lo-cal.
Something isn’t Kosher
I would have preferred the gravy train.
Due to subway maintenance, B, L, and T trains are experience severe delis.
I'm not that hungry......let's take the croissant town bus instead.
They asked if I wanted it to go.
It's hard to get anywhere in this city; the main arteries are always clogged.
This subway is headed to DC. It's full of bologna.
That one only goes to Little Italy.
Let’s wait. This one looks a little seedy.
Let's wait for the next one; this one's stuffed.
New improved subway??? I say it's the same old baloney.
Well you have to admit, it has never smelled this good down here.
I'll just eat on the train.
It’s more amazing that it arrived on schedule.
It's the BLT line
It only runs on the digestive track.
Wait for the next one- I don't want to be sandwiched in.
Is this the lo-cal?
The sign clearly said SUBWAY.
It's not what I ordered, but it's on time.
This is what happens when you put tariffs on Chinese steel.
Do you have your ticket to Rye?
Nope, that's not ours. It's got mayonnaise.
I ordered it to go.
I think that's the old BLT line.
They say each car is made fresh daily.
I get the subway pun, but mostly I'm just worried that there's a giant train in the sandwich shop right now.
If this were a New Yorker cartoon, there wouldn't be a caption.
No, that’s not us - we want the BLT line.
You wanna take this one - or wait for the BLT?
I miss the old subway.
This must be the new sub station we've been hearing about.
It's not the hero New York wants, but it's the hero New York needs.
Well, this is redundant.
I miss the days when the B, L, and T ran on separate lines.
We're finally going to rub elbows with the upper crust.
Wait, something doesn't feel Kosher.
The local broke down so they brought in a sub.
You go ahead. I'm waiting for the pastrami on Rye
Oh, right! Here in London you ask how to get to the Tube, not the subway.
Let's wait for the 12 inch. There's more room.
I said I wanted a sandwich to eat on the ride home, not a ride to eat on the sandwich home.
Well at least it's on time.
Yes, but at least it's on time.
You would think this city would know the difference between literally and figuratively.
I swear to God if I feel another salami pressed up on me today...
Let's wait for the next car.  I don't like feeling so sandwiched in.
Hurry, we need to ketchup so they will lettuce on.
I’ve heard these are built in New Deli.
Gee, I was hoping for the gravy train!
You go, I’ll take the Reuben.
We can eat on the train.
Huh. I always thought the name was ironic.
Not this one. We want the gravy train.
I guess Subway's new ad campaign is really on track.
The Grinder goes to Connecticut. If we want Philly, we take the Hoagie.
I tell you Madge, ever since this diet I see food everywhere.
We're on the wrong platform. We need the B, L or T trains.
You’ll want to switch to the BLT at Times Square.
5 more rides and we get a free one.
Great. We can eat on the way.
It's still better than the Panda Express.
Nope not ours. I said hold the mustard.
It looks full.
Let's ride in the club car.
That's Hamtrak. We want the BLT line.
That must be the train to Philly.
We want the BMT, not the BLT.
Wow, that's a surprise: It's on time and it's fresh!
You should see the rat that dragged it here.
This is my tenth ride, so the next one is free.
No, we're going to Rye.
...it was then that New Yorkers realized the long-touted infrastructure bill was drafted too hastily.
That would be clever in New York, but this is London.
Is that the club car?
Ok, see now you can say "literally".
I can't believe they named an entire transportation system after a sandwich!
Our subway is here.
Their advertising’s getting out of hand.
So they finally opened the B.L.T line...
The very last train will be vegan, I´m telling you.
They said we'd need a hero to fix the MTA...
Everything is so literal in this city.
Do you think we can get it to-go?
If you see something, say something
This must be the special.
I told you it would be worth the wait.
Not only is it ten minutes late, but they forgot the pickles!
I say we take it. Because the #2 and #3 combos never arrive on time.
Now that's what I call fast food
The Vegan is always less crowded.
I told you the subway improvements were a bunch of bologna.
We take this subway one stop and transfer to the BLT.
Looks like Trump fired the Secretary of Transportation.
That's the BLT, we want the BMT.
Thanks, but I think I will wait for the Gravy Train
I ordered it to go.
Now you know why they call it "Subway."
Hold on a sec...it’s a local. Let’s wait for the Panda Express
Let's see what's on the next one.
I get it, Larry. It's just not funny!
Pardon me, boy, but is that the Chattanooga Chew Chew?
I want it to go.
Going to a sub contractor was a bad idea.
It smells a lot better than the usual subway.
We’re late, and I’m hungry. Let’s take it.
Looks like this one's fully loaded.
You told me it was just a metaphor.
We want the BMT, not the BLT.
This is the hoagie to Little Italy. We want the hot dog to Coney Island.
We can take it to Times Square and grab a cross-town bagel.
It’s usually jam-packed.
That's not the one. We need the BLT line.
Mind waiting for a gluten free car?
At this time of day, it's always overstuffed.
Let's take the #9; it departs later but it comes with fries and and a drink.
Finally, a club car!
It is on time, but is it fresh?
This is the wrong subway.
I'd hate to see the rat that pulled that thing down the stairs.
Take The Ham Sub to 42nd Street and then change to a BLT.
A train that arrived on time! My hero.
I liked it better when Transportation and Agriculture were separate agencies.
Let's wait for the New Deli Express.
You sit next to the jalapeño this time.
That one looks kind of seedy.
Let's see...genoa salami--yes, this one goes to Little Italy.
This is where the B, L, and T lines converge.
Did you see the size of the rat dragging this sucker?
This one looks a little seedy. Let's wait for the next one.
Let's wait. The BLT arrives in five minutes.
Let's wait for the lo-cal.
Let's wait for the 2:15 bagel.
I assume that’s the dining car.
Try not to look surprised. You're a New Yorker!
I’m glad we don’t have a bullet train.
The train's pretty full - do you think they'll lettuce in?
Last time I took this one I ended up in a pretty big pickle.
No matter how you slice it, we're going to be late.
Now that's what I call a club car!
I thought you were misusing the word ‘literally’again.
IRT, BLT... as long as it gets us there.
Think we can sandwich in?
May be a grinder where you come from, but here it’s definitely a sub.
What's next? Actual cookies in our computers?
It all started when someone released a baby sandwich down here in the 80's.
Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga chew chew?
I think that's the train to Little Italy
They say the engineer was an Italian war hero.
Let's wait for the next one. I don't want to be sandwiched in.
That's the Express. We need the Lo-cal.
That's the express to Little Italy. An egg roll will be by in a few minutes to take us to Chinatown.
This is exactly what happens when rats are able to lobby Congress.
Don’t complain. If this was London we’d have to ride the Bangers and Mash.
I told you those brownies were amazing!
Surprise ! Meals on Wheels !!
So then my therapist says, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."
So I was telling Judith that the hardest part of dieting is that food is absolutely everywhere.
I told you this was the Subway stop.
I hate being sandwiched in with strangers.
My hero has finally arrived.
At least we won't feel like sardines.
No, that's the 6:00 hoagie to Philly, we want the 6:00 grinder to Boston.
That must be the train to Philly.
Call the Mayo Clinic.
Looks like we’re going to be sandwiched in again.
I take this train on a deli basis
Looks like your diet's about to go off the rails.
It's not even rush hour, and everyone's still sandwiched in.
I told you before. The 12-inch goes to Brooklyn. It's the 6-inch that goes to Queens.
Hence, the name.
Does this line stop at the Mayo Clinic?
Must be the dining car.
I think it's New York City's version of 'Meals on Wheels'.
Privatizing the subway system was a bad idea.
There's your proof. Now will you stop calling them "hoagies"?
Our fare includes a medium drink and a bag of chips.
It's the Trump Subway, all dough, little substance.
*sigh* I remember when this stop used to be kosher.
Damn homonyms.
Well that certainly one-ups the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile...
Subway is testing a new fast-food line.
Maybe legalization wasn’t such a great idea after all
Oh good, the BLT's on time.
No, the Philly train is a cheese steak.
Well, I guess this means they finally put an end to the gravy train.
Did you bring the coupon?
Last time I rode this some guy exposed his pepperoncino.
Let's wait, the Express comes with mustard.
Excuse me. Is that the BLT?
Let's wait for the 11:40, it's gluten free.
I hear it runs entirely on oil and vinegar.
I've got it. This is the literal line. We need metaphorical.
Is this the BLT?
Oh, I thought we were waiting for the gravy train.
I had no idea Subway delivered.
Wow, that IS good peyote...
I'm pretty sure this one came from Philly.
It's the hero New York deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
This’ll get us to midtown; we can call a slider to take us the rest of the way.
That's the #1. The #2 comes with a drink.
I thought we were taking the BLT
Gives "fast food" a new meaning...
I think I understand why the New York subways have a rodent problem.
We're in the wrong subway.
The gluten-free isn't due for ten more minutes.
They sandwiched this express in between the local trains
The B,L and T lines are running on same track tonight.
Any way you slice it, we're not going to get a seat.
Let's wait for the roast beef.
You call that infrastructure revitalization? If you ask me, it's full of baloney.
Let's wait for the one without onions.
I hope I don't have to sit next to an anchovy again.
What did you expect? This is a Subway station.
Why don't you take this one, I'm vegan.
That must be the club car.
Looks like we'll have to sandwich ourselves in.
I'm just worried about where this is headed.
Let’s wait for the next one, it’s a Reuben
Wait, this train will take us to Dehli...we want the one that goes to Rye.
You should see what they’re working with in Philly.
Talk about a moveable feast.
Is this what they meant by transportation cuts?
Italian! I thought we were in the French Quarter.
That explains the fare increase to $5.99
We change here for the uptown BLT.
Now THAT's product placement!
Looks like you can have your subway and eat it too.
Looks stuffed! Let's wait for the next one.
The merger was the only way for the MTA to survive.
Let's catch the next one. I don't want to be sandwiched in there.
I hate fasting before a blood test.
Let's wait for the next one. I don't want to be sandwiched in.
Let's wait for the Special, it comes with chips and a drink.
Transfer available to the N, the R, and the BLT.
Let's wait for the Panda Express.
No Jared that train has left, and this is a dream, and you're still in prison.
Let’s wait. The next one is gluten free.
That's the local hero; let's wait for the express.
And the third rail keeps it warm and toasty!
This would make no sense in London.
I guess that explains the train in the sub shop upstairs.
So THAT'S where the name came from!
Please let it be one with no onions.
Well... I think corporate sponsorship has finally gone too far.
Let's wait for the BLT.
Did you use an uppercase S when you Googled ‘nearest subway’?
Let's wait for the express. It's kosher.
Did she say take the BMT or the BLT?
Did you order it to go?
Well...it is a subway station.
"That's a local, the express doesn't have lettuce and tomato".
You DID ask for a sub to go.
This is total baloney.
It's not real. You're just hungry.
Flying is faster, but you only get peanuts.
I think it's the dining car.
No graffiti -- that's fresh!
I’ll take it if it’s a lo-cal
I don't think it's dementia if I see it too.
At least it's on time.
Must be the dining car.
And then a hero comes along.
It's the BLT line
We should be early, so long as nothing goes a rye.
Who knew the MTA would resort to irony?
Well, you did order it to go.
Is this the sub-standard service we'eve been hearing about?
Too crowded. Let's wait for the lo-cal.
Stand clear of the closing dough.
Technically, the sign isn't wrong.
Let's get it to go.
Wow! Imagine the song that Duke Ellington could write about this!
If we transfer at 34th street, we get a cookie and a soda.
Let's wait, the 10:36 usually has more cheese.
Ooh, this one has a club car!
It's the hero this city deserves.
OK. I'm pretty sure the drugs have kicked in.
That's not ours, dear. The man told us to take the BLT.
Well, it did say 'Sub' station
Can you imagine what it's going to smell like down here in July?
I have no appetite for public transportation.
This is the local. The express has pickles.
We can change at Grand Central to the BLT.
I hate to be sandwiched in like that.
You know, I’m not that hungry – why don’t we just grab an Uber?
If you can wait, the next one at 11:15 is pastrami.
I'll stand. You grab a seed.
Seeing the elaborate lengths his friends went to by putting a sub in the subway on April Fool's day, he decided not to take his date to Dick's Sporting Goods as planned.
This is taking "product placement" a bit far.
Don't sit next to the onion, respect the provolone and don't try and be a Hero.
If it touches the third rail it will get toasted.
Don't be a hero. We'll catch the next train.
Let's wait for the next one, this one has onions.
Not this one, we want the Lo-cal.
Let’s wait. The next one should be less filling.
Now that's what I call a subway.
They call it the Christie Car.
Would it kill the MTA to heat them?
We did order it to-go.
Dad told me this line used to be called the BLT.
They must've combined B, L, and T trains again.
This one is OK. It's the sardine car that they really pack them in.
They say heros come in all sizes.
I thought the last stop on the B, L, T was 34th
It's the new BLT Line
I thought this was supposed to be The Big Apple.
It might be the hero Gotham deserves, but it's not the one it needs right now.
Is this the train for Rye?
You go ahead. I'm waiting for a falafel.
It’s not the hero we wanted. But it’s the hero we deserve.
Let's wait for the lo-cal.
No, that’s the 9-Grain Wheat to Flatbush. We want the Chicken Bacon Ranch to Queens.
You hold the doors, I'll hold the mayo.
We need the IRT, not the BLT.
It's too crowded. Let's wait for the BLT.
Here's the chew-chew now.
It's tempting, but the service is still sub-standard.
I think we should wait for the Gravy Train.
This one's always packed.
It's like an oven down here
"Wait, that's not our Subway. Ours has cheese".
The Gravy Train should be next in about 5 minutes.
Do we want this one, or the BLT to Grand Central?
Wait for the local. The express always give me heartburn .
Legalizing recreational marijuana does have its unanticipated consequences!
OMG! They must have approved the merger.
That must be the dining car...
Looks crowded -- let's wait for the footlong.
Wait! The vegan express is less crowded.
I'm on a diet. Let's wait for the lo-cal.
Let's wait for the next one, this one's loaded.
Let's wait for the next one. This is the lo-cal.
The meat’s artisanal, blue smoked in Brooklyn Heights. So it must be a local.
Wait dear, we’re on the Reuben.
This commute is always such a grinder
Did he say we should take the BMT or the BLT?
Looks like those cartoonists at the New Yorker are running out of ideas.
I don't care where it takes us, I getting on it. I'm starving.
Who did you say Trump appointed as Transportation Secretary again?
This looks stuffed - let's wait for the next one.
Must be the new dining car.
It's Elon Musk's latest solution for both mass transit and world hunger.
No, we want the uptown panini.
Gosh, honey, I guess the guidebook wasn't kidding when it said take the subway for an authentic taste of the city.
Let’s find the club car.
Oh my God... It's on time!
The announcement said they're holding for mustard.
Hopefully this lures it out so they can finally catch it.
In London, it's toothpaste.
Wait for the next one...this one's stuffed
I can't tell if this is the hoagie to Philly or the grinder to New England...
At last! Here's the dining car.
For here or to go?
These subway repairs are really on a roll.
Hold up. I'm waiting for the lo-cal.
If our plane has buffalo wings, we're in trouble.
Let's wait for the multigrain.
Yikes! It's loaded. Better wait for the next one.
Since we went gluten-free, it's tough to get anywhere in this city
My Hero!
I heard the BLT broke down.
I can't believe how much they've increased the fare!
Is that a chew-chew-train?
I wasn’t being literal, dear.
Sigh… Back to the daily grinder.
No, I'm waiting for the B/L/T...
I don't know...They claim it's not fast food.
And they wonder why there’s a rat problem.
I hear they’ve got double deckers in London.
It’s a Subway. What did you expect--a Big Mac?
Not really what you'd call "subliminal" product placement, is it?
This is the express to Hoagieboken.
It only goes as far as Little Italy.
Really dislike getting sandwiched on the Subway.
David, we mustn't! This train's not kosher.
See, I told you the subway was getting seedier and seedier.
It's the MTA's idea of a dining car.
De Blasio's new subway plan looks like a lot of baloney to me.
I'm happy to take the subway but this corporate sponsorship is getting out of hand.
We need to wait for the 2:30, it's gluten free.
It's powered by a peck of pickled peppers.
You've got it backwards...hoagies run uptown and grinders run downtown.
I'd pass on this one. It looks like it's been sitting there for a while.
Subway calls it the "Mile-long" but they're getting sued because it's really only 5,279 feet.
That’s the BLT to Brooklyn
I knew there would be changes under a Chris Christie administration
If you think this is bad, you should see what McDonald's is doing in St. Louis.
This must be that new BLT line.
Too crowded; let's wait for a footlong.
Yeah, it's artisanal and from Brooklyn, but it was still 40 minutes late.
I hope we don't get stuck sitting by some turkey.
Don't. The 6-inch gets you uptown much faster.
Told you so! Subway does deliver!
Change at 42nd street for the BLT.
Wait. Don't take this one. It's the lo-cal.
Wow. Graffiti just keeps getting better and better.
Lets go, we can get a bite to eat on our way.
They couldn’t afford a tunnel under the river, so they bought subs.
This will take forever. Next time we hail a cabbage.
Don't even say it.
Don’t sit on the tomato. You’re wearing white pants.
Let's wait for the club car.
I was just getting over the Oscar Meyer wiener bus.
Let's wait. This one has onions.
Honey, I think those brownies are kicking in.
Don't sit next to the onions.
This is the Hoagy car, Michael.
Now that’s some serious product placement marketing.
Transfer here for the BLT?
Let's wait for the C train — it's gluten free.
I told you BLT didn't mean Brooklyn Line Transit.
Shall we take the subway?
This one goes straight to The Hips.
Let's wait for the local,this one looks loaded.
That's what I call product placement.
I'm not that hungry, let's wait for the expresso.
" Well, it is very nice, but is it Art"?
They call it fast food but it still makes local stops.
Let's wait for the next one; it's a vegetarian, so should be plenty of seats.
This commute is getting to be a real grinder.
I always wondered why they called it Subway!
That doesn't look like the lo-cal.
I am told the Paris metro runs express baguettes
Sometimes a double entendre can go too far.
Once they trademarked the name, it was just a matter of time.
Let's wait for the next one. It's vegan.
I think this is where we catch the chew-chew train.
Let's wait for the uptown BLT
If the next train is a kosher dill pickle, we’ve died and gone to Heaven.
They say these will accommodate twice as many passengers, but I think they’re full of baloney.
You know it’s bad when they replace trains with puns.
It must be the BLT.
Don’t worry, there’ll be a meatball on white along any minute now.
This must be the hero they sent to fix the subways.
No wait, we need the crosstown croissant.
Can you believe ‘The New Yorker’ used color ink for this?
I thought this was the IRT, but it's the BLT.
I don't like the taxis in Rome either, but is this Italian subway any better?
When did they change the BMT to the BLT?
I'm leary about the new Subway / subway merger.
The salami I like. It's the irony I don't care for.
We'll have to catch the next one. This one's filled.
Well, at least the subway isn’t jam-packed!
Stand back. A big slushy comes next.
Let's wait for the next train. This one's a Subway.
Looks like our meal ticket has finally arrived
Is that the new BLT line?
Let’s take this to go.
This isn't ours. We're ham and cheese.
Wait till you see what Jack-in-the-Box did to the Statue of Liberty.
That's the express. We want the lo-cal.
Will you at least consult with me before you use your last wish?
Remember, it was your choice to take lunch to work today.
You want the IRT express; that’s the BLT local.
Imagine the busses in Frankfurt.
Let’s take this to go.
Let's wait for the next one, I'm pretty sure this isn't Kosher
I'll wait for the next one. I'm counting my carbs.
My first day on Jenny Craig & I see this.
These Subway® ads are getting out of control.
Lettuce on!
No, you're just hungry. I told you to eat something before we left home.
Transfers available to the B, L, and T trains
We can take this to 42nd and change for the croissant.
It's the new train to Hoagieboken.
This product placement thing has gotten out of hand.
now that's a subway
They arrived just in time to catch the $5.99.
No, that’s the Gluten line. We want the Vegan.”
My Hero!
I always wanted to ride on a Subway. But, my Mother said it wouldn't be Kosher.
Well...we did say “to go.”
Is this the B, L, or T train?
Shall we grab a bite on the train?
I can't believe four BLTs have passed in the past 20 minutes, but not a single Turkey!
Looks packed.
Anyway you slice it, it beats walking.
Maybe we should take the next one. It looks pretty stuffed.
We only need to take 6 more and the last one is free.
The 12:05 always clogs the main artery.
This is a stupid cartoon.
That's 'Subway Eat/Fresh' we're looking for 'Subway East/West'
Maybe you have to say, 'Open, sesame.'
I never realized that MTA had such a rye sense of humor.
It smells better than the last subway.
If we hurry, we can make the club car.
Only heroes ride the subway these days.
There's a vegan line but it only stops in Brooklyn.
When I’m hungry everything looks like something to eat.
That's what I call a dining car.
I shouldn't. I took a double-decker to work.
no wait, it's just a metaphor
No honey we need the downtown BLT
Let's wait for the gravy train.
It's fully loaded. Let's wait for the next one.
So is this a sub weigh station?
I told you the subway is seedy.
This is the Subway New York deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
I hope that smell is the cheese
Honey, relax, there's an express just four minutes out and it's toasted.
Let’s wait and see if the next one comes with pickles.
This really is a Subway station.
Take the BLT Express to Times Square, where you can switch to the P,B and J lines.
I think they’re taking this corporate sponsorship thing a bit too far.
I told you this station seemed seedy.
O.K. This is taking product placement to a whole new level
I guess we missed the 11:00 gyro.
It looks like it's stuffed, let's wait for the next one.
There goes my hero.
Now that's a hero's welcome.
Let's wait for the next one, this one's loaded.
At least this Subway runs on time
Well, we did ask for the closest Subway.
I think this whole "product placement" thing is going a bit too far.
And then a hero comes along.
Remember when the New Yorker had a caption contest?
My first time travelling on the Subway and it's not quite what I expected........
That’s the BLT to Coney Island.
Oh look, here comes the BLT
I thought we were on the BMT not the BLT!
Looks packed. Should we wait for the next one?
I hate being sandwiched in; wait for the next one.
Next Stop. Hell's Kitchen.
Eponym, dear; not homonym.
Freud calls it the Edible Complex.
You'll never find a sandwich like that above 14th Street.
Guess I shouldn't have asked for it to go.
I said if this happened again I was quitting cold turkey.
Looks like we’ve entered the collective sub-conscious.
Did we want the BMT or the BLT?
Transfer here to the B, L, or T.
This puts an entirely new spin on the Meals On Wheels concept.
this Cristo bullshit has to stop
You wanna take this one or get the next Multi-grain?
Somehow, with Trump in office, this makes sense.
You take everything so literally
The MTA did say we'd be seeing a bigger and better Subway.
Five dollars?! I remember when it cost a nickel.
Wow! That's almost as weird as that Rubens Exhibit at the Met.
It's a movable feast.
Let’s wait for the hoagie.
No, this is the 2. The 3 has roast beef.
Did Siri say to take the BRT or the BLT?
There must be a way to blame Trump for this.
I'm sick of the daily grinder.
Is it possible we're at the wrong subway?
So, how is your diet going? Do you still have cravings?
Now there's a merger gone a-rye
That's the 12" Cold Cut Combo; we want the 6" Meatball Marinara to Gansevoort Street.
It’s the number 6 with everything on it.
You were right, it does smell like pickle juice down here.
It looks too crowded. Let's wait for the foot-long.
Great! We can get a bite on the ride home!
It's lunchtime, it'll never make it past 72nd Street.
It seems a shame they’re running a footlong when it isn’t even rush hour.
Now that's what I call a real Substation.
Next stop is Heinz 57th Street
Let's take the bus instead. I'm off gluten.
Lets wait for the next ride, looks like someone cut the cheese on this one.
Honey, it could be worse, we could be in a real pickle.
Let's wait for the next one. I think it will be a ham and cheese.
Are you sure they said “take the subway?”
What? Were you expecting a club car?
I'm still going to call it a hero.
Personally, I think the corporate sponsorships are getting out of hand.
I hope they lettuce on.
My English teacher was right. Capital letters make a difference.
Did you hear they're shutting down the BLT?
We take this to the BLT.
Its the Christie Express to Jersey.
Fast food my ass!
I hate it when my dreams interfere with my commute.
This must be our train, the Foot Long-Island.
Good, we're on time for the downtown sub.
How do we tell the cartoonist that’s a hoagie?
The lobster roll should be next
Wait 'till the rats get a load of this
I hear the service is to be cut in half
I thought this line was Kosher.
Wow, the legendary hoagie car, Michael!
How come the turkey always comes when you’re waiting for the tuna?
Well, they did give us directions to the Subway.
I guess we shouldn't be surprised. The sign said, Subway.
No, I'm waiting for the reuben.
That's not ours, Dear. We're waiting for the Gravy Train
Are we sure these new cars are kosher?
It's six inches longer during rush hour.
We need to wait for the lo cal.
There she is. The 12:10 to Bologna.
Twenty bucks says the rats finish it off before it's half way to Astoria Boulevard.
This one goes to Little Italy.
It may be fast, but I doubt it’s fresh.
It goes into the tunnel and comes out toasted.
So, is this fast food?
Let's wait for the next one, this has onions.
That explains why the tokens looked like pepperoni.
So that's where they got the name.
Mind the wrap.
I guess I should've been more precise when I prayed for a larger-than-life hero.
Corporate acquisitions do not always work out for the consumer, do they?
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted one Subway Sandwich to-go
I finally got used to Shea Stadium becoming Citi Field and the Jets playing at MetLife Stadium but I’m having trouble swallowing this SUBWAY sponsorship.
Don't sit next to the onions.
We need the Turkey with Bacon to get to Queens.
You should see the rats.
We all ride in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
Let's wait for the next one. I hate being sandwiched.
We want the BLT to Chinatown. This is the Poboy to Wall Street.
They must've rerouted the BLT line.
I hear the Cialis ad wrap is even worse.
It look full, but maybe we can sandwich ourselves in.
I hope the conductor washed his hands.
I think we used the wrong app.
Let’s wait for the next one. I hate onions.
I wonder how long has it been sitting there?
That's the turkey and cheese. Let's wait for the meatball sub.
Let's wait for the burrito to Broadway.
Do you think the third rail could toast it?
It's not going where I want to go, but for $7, who cares?
Great, now it's gonna smell like piss and pickles.
Sourdough with no mustard, must be going to White Plains. What time is the one to Rye?
Wait- the express is fresher.
No. No...We're taking the egg-roll to Chinatown.
Oh good, it's the express to Little Italy.
Not this one; the Cold Cut Combo doesn't stop at 86th St.
Wow, this takes "to go" to a whole new level.
We’ll sandwich ourselves in there somehow.
Pardon me, is this where I transfer from the IRT to the BLT line ?
Okay, now the "Mind the Mayo" signs make sense.
This takes product placement to a whole new level.
I don't like fast food.
Now this is my kind of subway.
Does this transfer to Flushing?
That's not the hero we need right now.
Do we have a coupon?
Talk about sandwiching them in!
This is not what I meant when I said we needed a new subway system.
Looks packed.
I don't know about these public-private partnerships.
Well, it's back to the daily grinder.
I didn't know they would deliver.
Some people don’t understand metaphor
At least it's running on time.
They're not going to like this in Philadelphia.
It's a nice ride, but you smell like onions for hours afterward.
Do you think this is where they got the name?
It's amazing what graffiti artists can do these days.
Umm, I think the shrooms are kicking in." "Ya. No way the metro is actually on time.
What say we take the hoagie to Muskogee?
If we take this one we’re going to be in a pickle .
Did you order it to go?
It’s now running gluten free all the way to 86th street.
Excuse me, I think that’s my order.
Don’t forget to save room for the bus.
Is this one the deli express?
Not only does it smell better than the F train, it arrived on time.
This car is a bit too seedy for me.
It's a homonym stupid.
I knew this would happen if Philadelphia won the Super Bowl!
Now, that's fast food!
I think this is the closest thing to a hero that we'll see for the next three years, hold the Ham!
That's the result of Trump's "Infrastructure Week."
The BLT don't stop here anymore.
Must be the express from Philly.
Now that's what I call product placement!
See, I told you this sub station was the real deal.
It's the Foot Long Island Express.
Oops! Wrong Subway.
I knew it. Nothing else smells like Subway.
I dunno -- without the socialist zeal, surrealism seems like just so much arbitrary incongruity.
The new subway cars are so tasteful.
Figures. We're late, but you're allergic to tomatoes.
So that’s why they taste like that.
The effects of the medical marijuana were kicking in.
This must be the 6:20 to New Delhi.
When you said we were going to the Subway on 14th St. for lunch, this is not what I envisioned.
I feel like we’d be sandwiched in.
Are you sure we’re supposed to transfer to the BLT train?
Well, this is just a bunch of baloney!
Let's wait and catch the vegan.
We'll just have to sandwich ourselves in.
Well at least it's running on time.
Are you sure it said "Walk to 14th and take the Subway"?
Hey! Lettuce on the train!
The fastest food I've ever seen!
But is the bread local?
Let's wait for the uptown, it's got prosciutto and Gruyere.
Do you think we can get that to go?
Wow- talk about product placement !
They tried it on the El but there were too many pigeons.
Forget it, Harvey. It’s not kosher.
Every time that I get on this subway, I end up smelling like meat and cheese.
Let's wait. This car is totally stuffed.
Is this express? I try to only eat local.
Finally, a break from the sex metaphors.
We should asked for the Metro not the Subway.
Sure it's huge, but look at the size of the rat that's pulling it.
I gave up my seat for an elderly pickle.
The subway seems two inches smaller than it used to.
Something tells me this will get us to Jersey, Mike.
We’ll get off at 34th Street and take the Hoagie to Philly.
Wait until you see the size of the rats
No way, we’ll get eaten alive in there.
Wait, is this a Subway?
That's NOTHING. You ought to see the RAT!
They were right: To run the subways on time, it takes a hero.
Bob Mankoff would never have put up with this.
I said we wanted the IRT not the BLT
That’s weird. My eyes are surprised, but my gag reflex remains unfazed.
Can you imagine the size of the rats!?!
Could you ask the conductor whether it’s gluten free?
I think this is the wrong Subway.
Sure, but where is a hero when you really need one?
I think corporate sponsorship has gone too far!
I'd take the new BLT line more often, but I always feel so sandwiched in.
So, it's a visual pun! It's going uptown. Take it.
Let’s wait for the BLT espress
I guess I assumed BLT stood for Brooklyn Long Island Transit.
Jim, this isn't what I had in mind when you told me I was going to ride your foot-long.
Okay, corporate sponsorship is really getting out of hand.
'So many metaphors, so little time'.
No, that's the footlong. We need to wait for the six inch.
Oh darn! I thought this was the platform for the BLT.
No Dear, we need the Turkey, the Tuna goes to Queens on the weekend.
Now THAT's product placement!
I’d rather score a joint on the High Line.
The express looks packed, let's wait for the lo-cal
Just pretend you're a condiment.
No... let's wait for the brioche
"That's a local, the express doesn't have lettuce and tomato".
I don't want to be sandwiched in...let's wait for the next one.
They've renamed it the BLT line.
Let's wait. I don't want to get sandwiched in.
Let's take a cab instead, I am avoiding carbs.
I thought we were catching the panini.
No...ours is the turkey, not the ham
Should we just get lunch here?
It looks loaded, let’s wait on the next one.
It’s part of the peace treaty with the rats.
It's fun now, but just wait until August.
Get ready for a lot of baloney.
Let's wait. This one has onions.
Maybe we should take the cross-town bagel?
If you see something, say something
You'll have to switch to the Roast Beef at 34th Street.
It began with a trademark dispute.
Let's walk, I'm not hungry.
You know I don't like fast food.
This is definitely the wrong Subway.
I’m still waiting for the gravey train
You go ahead, Im waiting for a spinach wrap.
There goes your train of thought.
You wanna take this sub or wait on the hoagie?
What's a B.L.T. doing on the N tracks?
It’s better in Europe. They have croissants.
Should we take the 12-inch or wait for the 6?
Must be a new one; no graffiti.
Maybe we shouldn't go for groceries on an empty stomach.
We should have taken the bus rather than the Subway.
Let's wait for the Ruben.
Tempting, but I think I'll wait for the 5:34 with onions.
We'll catch the next one. This one's a hoagie.
The gravy train is coming up next.
Wanna take it to 96th or just eat it here?
If we miss this train, we'll be in a pickle.
I hate it when people take things so literally.
You just say open sesame.
If you want more peppers and onion, wait for the 6:03.
Well, we just missed the number 9 on wheat.
We won't get on this one no matter how you slice it.
I’m too full, let’s catch the next one.
Why is express food running on the locally sourced track?
This must be the MMMMM train.
It looks full and I hate being sandwiched.
That would explain the train in the sandwich shop.
Is this the lo-cal?
Who says the engineers over at the MTA don't have a sense of humor?
I think I’ll wait for the Lite Rail.
If you had just ordered a foot long like every one else we could have picked it up at the counter.
There's a bagel in four minutes. Should we wait for that?
Stand clear of the closing buns.
Sub-liminal adverting?
We always called them "hoagies" to avoid this type of mix-up.
I'm not that hungry, let's wait for the expresso.
Take this to 34th and change for the prosciutto and provolone.
My God! Was there something in those brownies?
The Brits can have the Tube, I prefer the Subway.
No, that one goes to Little Italy. Ours is the bagel and cream cheese.
So is this the "H", the "E", the "R", or the "O"?
I don't think this is ours? It's on whole wheat.
Let's wait for the next one...this one looks stuffed.
I'm waiting for the panini. The sub's always packed.
I can't ride it, I'm a vegetarian.
Kind of an obvious joke, isn't it, honey?
And they wonder why Americans are overweight.
They say the subway's cleaner now, but that's a lot of baloney.
No dear, this isn't ours. This is the lo-cal.
No, that’s just the ‘foot long’ the 14 will be here in 4 minutes.
Ours is next, this one has tomatoes.
I'd rather spring for a cab than have to be so sandwiched in.
I told you it’s a subway, not a metro.
This is why we call it the sub and not the metro.
I think it's the meatball that goes uptown.
At least the new subway cars smell better...
Now this is what I call a subway stop!
Next stop, Sesame Street.
It's fully loaded...We'll wait for the next one.
It’s a hybrid. Runs on oil and vinegar.
Hold on. Chips should come with that.
Looks good, but is it local?
That explains the $5 ticket cost.
I’m waiting for the gluten free.
I took one home earlier, let's just wait for the gravy train.
It's Trump's idea; replaces food stamps.
What's a hoagie doing in a subway?
Next stop: Philly...cheesesteak
Still better than the gravy train.
You only think it's a sub because we're in the subway. I'm telling you its definitely a hero.
Well, you did ask for it to go.
The gluten free car is at the end.
They should name a train after this thing.
Well the sign out front did say Subway.
The new Subway promotional is terrific.
When I said 'let's take the subway', I didn't mean it literally.
Let’s wait for the double decker
Hop on,hon.We'll grab a bite on the way!
Look at the menu. We're lost.
I’m finding this hard to digest.
Yes, I'm sure it goes to Little Italy.
I told you we should have left earlier to beat the lunch crowd.
This is taking product placement way too far.
The sign outside said SUBWAY, didn’t it?
Let's wait for the next one, it's gluten free.
That’s why it’s called a subway.
Must be from Philly
Wait. The next one could be a panini.
Go ahead; I’ll wait for gluten free.
Onions. We'd better wait for the next one.
Wow, they have really taken the Lunch Car to the next level!
Chew-chew!
It's a trap.
Do you think we can get that to go?
I don’t care if it takes all day, we’re waiting for the gluten-free.
You have to be a hero to ride the subway.
I don't get it
Is that the roast beef to downtown or the salami to Brooklyn?
They still don’t put enough lettuce on the L.
I always said the MTA needs a hero.
It's free if it arrives a minute late.
This is a bit too literal for my taste.
That's not ours. We're waiting for the Chicken Parm.
The six inch should be along shortly.
I never take this train--too many carbs.
It's the new line - the BLT.
SUBWAY is taking its advertising too far.
This is the new Subway station
I hope it's heated.
Let's wait for the next one. It comes with onions.
I'd always assumed the name was because it was underground.
Some genius got a quarter of a million for coming up with that.
I thought you said the 3:10 came with cheese
Let's wait for the express. The local has too much mayo.
Product placement has really gotten out of hand.
I thought the uptown subs were all vegetarian.
Don't rush...it's just the Italian. We need to catch the Cold Cut Combo.
Let's wait for a pizza.
This is an extreme example of "product placement".
They’ve taken product placement to a whole new level.
This is what you meant when you said “meat at the station?”
Thank God it’s on time, I’m famished!
Let’s wait for the next one. I feel like pastrami.
I hope they can sandwich us in.
I said IRT, not BLT.
I think we're in a pickle.
Your attention please. Now arriving on track 2 - the coronary express
The express comes with chips and a drink.
Now THAT’S a dining car.
I hope the sub to the Village is vegetarian.
Talk about product placement!
This one looks a little too seedy.
Provolone goes uptown, this is Swiss.
Let's roll!
Is this the uptown Sub?
I thought we were taking the BLT line?
God I must be hungry.
No wonder there's a rat problem.
If that's not the A Train, I'll eat it!
Stop! Let's wait for the lo-cal.
Artisanal bread...it’s definitely the local.
And if you finish it by the end of your ride, it’s free.
Let's wait for the next one. We'll be sandwiched in there.
Wait - that one only goes to Little Italy
I'll wait for the crosstown hoagie.
I told you the BLT is faster!
Finally, the hero MTA deserves.
At least we can eat on the train.
This is Bologna!
I really like this new Subway campaign.
They may not run on time, but at least they're baked fresh daily.
Look, it's the Hoagie Car, Michael!
Wait for the D train; it's gluten free.
This isn't the fast food I had in mind.
This one takes you directly to the emergency room.
. . . and if it doesn't arrive within a half hour it's free.
I've seen bigger.
Hold on! The gluten-free gets here in five minutes.
That's the Ham & Swiss we're waiting for the Pastrami on Rye.
I hear there's a Reuben at 86th Street
That's the Pastrami on Rye to the Bronx. We want the Ham and Swiss to Queens.
Can we get it to go?
Whoa! Clearly, The Big Apple has met its match.
It's about time they have a Dining Car.
The upper deck can get a little toasty
Should we grab a bite first?
No honey, we’re waiting for the meatball to midtown.
Hmmm.... I think we're in the wrong Subway.
Now that's what I call fast food
Let's wait... that's the lo-cal.
No, No, not this one! The Vegan arrives in half an hour.
Subway fare.
That must be the new BLT line.
The directions did say to take the subway ...
Honey, I said the BMT, not the BLT.
Is that the BMT or the BLT?
Is this the B, the L or the T?
The rats have more power in this city than I thought.
This time, you're sitting by the tomato.
I thought this was the pasta station
We can’t just wait here all day for one without mayo
Not my train. I'm vegan.
Why is the Black Forest Ham running on the Roast Beef line?
They were the only bid for subway cars made in New York City
Actually, rider satisfaction has improved dramatically!
Is that for here or to go?
No, Dear. The BMT goes to Little Italy. Its the Roast Beef that goes to Rockefeller Center.
You should have seen my Uber this morning.
We'll probably get sandwiched between a couple of meatballs...
Yes, it is an Italian subway, after all we’re in Rome.
Its only the substation
I see the Costco-Subway merger went through.
I told you Subway is fast food.
Well, if this is the Whitney Museum stop, it must be site specific, post-ironic sandwich art.
No! I just can't understand why it is in color while we're still in black and white?
It looks more packed than usual.
I heard Subway was going underground but I didn't believe it.
Don't fret, you're still my hero.
The yellow stuff on this subway might actually be mustard.
Told you it's an oven down here!
Did we miss the gluten-free option?
That’s not ours. Toasted will be along shortly.
It's on a roll
Sub? No way!
We saw something, what do we say?
I've heard if you see something, say something.
I don't relish this commute.
It's the 'MMMMMMM' train.
McDonald's just uses Uber.
That explains the rats.
Wait for the next one, its a Tuna.
Go ahead, I'll wait for the next caption.
The graffiti artists sure have improved
Would that be a homophone or a homonym?
Well the smell is far more pleasant.
No, the one with Russian Dressing goes to Brighton beach.
Funny. You almost never can catch the $5 footlong on the weekends these days.
I don't care about that, how do you like my hat?
I knew there was a Subway at Union Square!
Should we take the subway or wait for the BLT line?
Russia might have the largest subs but we have the biggest heros.
No, that’s the 2:17 ham and tomato. Ours is the 2:23 b.l.t.
Let's wait for the next one, it's gluten free.
Let's get the next one, it's gluten free.
It never fails. Whenever you're in a hurry, it's always three salamis with provolone, one after the other.
If there's mayo I'm not getting on.
Let's eat it now....it'll be stale by 34th Street.
Let's wait for one that's gluten free.
I don't care if it's running on time, I ordered the whole wheat.
That's the Ham Sub to SoHo. We're looking for the Italian Sub to Little Italy.
That line is the fast track to obesity.
No, that's not the 6:15 to D.C., there's no bologna on it.
Yeah, it looks full ... but its right on thyme.
That’s the pepperoni and provolone to South Ferry. We need to wait for the hot Italian meatball to Clark Street.
Wild right? Wait till you see the Flushing Line!
Damn Product Placement!
wait for the express, it's fresher.
Stand clear of the sliding cheese, please.
We change at Huntington to a cannoli for the last few stops.
Lettuce on that train.
I hear it's the fastest food in the city!
What makes you think we are in the Meatpacking District?
This one is full of baloney.
You can have your sub and ride it too.
Whoa! They really put some dough into the subway system!
They replaced the gravy train.
Excuse me but is that the BLT train?
Open sesame?
Looks like the MTA misunderstood your suggestion that only a hero can save the subways.
So this is why they raised fares to $5.
Look what rolled in
Let's wait for one without tomatoes.
It’s the new BLT downtown line.
This is the new art installation "SUBWAY SUBWAY"
That's taking subway to a whole new level.
I just started my diet, let's wait for the express, it's a turkey on whole wheat.
In Philly, you get on a hoagie.
Oh, honey, waiting for the Vegan option will set us back another twenty minutes.
We’ll wait for the local. It’s gluten free.
Let's take the BLT instead.
This is the Italian capicolla, we’re wating for the roast beef with horseradish.
Can we get it to go?
At a time like this, New York needs a hero.
Finally! The 4:10 to Indigestion.
No, we're taking the Reuben downtown.
Let’s wait for the double decker
Let's wait for the 12-inch. More legroom.
Oh, it looks delicious, but does it stop 33rd and Rawson?
We can catch this, or wait for the Eastbound Souvlaki at 12:30.
Can I get that to go?
No, it isn’t ironic.
Well of course it’s a subway.
You ordered the 12ft. with everything?????
It's being delivered to Trump Tower.
"Let's wait for 5:15, it comes with chips".
Can we wait for the vegetarian?
Don't be a hero trying to catch it.
This one looks full. Let's take the next one.
That millennial was right, this is LITERALLY the subway station.
This is ham. Roast beef goes uptown.
I’m holding out for a hero.
I'm waiting for the 11:10 roast beef.
That doesn't look like the one for Rye.
Not this one. It’s the Hoagie to Philadelphia.
Oh great, another train loaded with meatballs!
Let's wait for the next one; I don't want to get sandwiched in there.
We're supposed to take the B, to the L, to the T.
We'll get the next one Lois, they're really sandwiched in there.
Trump appointed Dagwood Secretary of Transportation.
No no. This is the white. We need the whole wheat.
Looks like we'll be sandwiched in again.
Don't try to be a hero.
No, let's wait for the Deli Express.
The 3:10 comes with mayo
Well, this is a subway, what did you expect?
You should see the Dunkin' Donuts promotion during morning rush hour.
I told you the train was full of baloney!
I pretty sure that's the number one.
Let's wait for the six inch.
I refuse to be sandwiched on another subway.
It's late because someone said, "Hold the mayo."
Great! The BLT is on time!
That's peculiar--what's a submarine doing here?
So this is where the name came from.
If it doesn’t get you there in 20 minutes, it’s free.
Hold the door and the pickles, please.
It's a working class hero!
They're certainly sandwiching them in, aren't they?
Dear, it looks like they rerouted the BLT.
Chew-chew!
So this is where they got the name!
No, that's a grinder. We're waiting for the local.
The subway is a real grinder.
Oh, great. Another subway hero.
It's the Eponymous Express.
Let's wait for the next one. It's an express and vegetarian.
I always wondered why it was called the subway.
Looks like we’re too late. They must stop running breakfast at 10:30.
Just wait until you see the size of the rats.
I hope it's not crowded in there. I hate when I get sandwiched in.
No kidding. If anyone's riding that thing, they're in a pickle.
It must be the BLT train.
I hate sitting on lettuce.
In Philadelphia, they call it the "Hoagie System."
I always thought it was short for submarine.
I'll wait for the gluten-free line.
Let's wait for the local. That's the "Heartburn Express."
That must be the BLT line.
The hero this city deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
Look! It’s the express train to Bologna
Too late. It’s fully loaded.
Let’s wait for the local. It’s fresher.
I think we should wait for the Panda Express.
Are you gonna say it or should I?
They weren't lying when they called it fast food.
You're the one who asked for directions to the Subway.
Okay, take a couple bites first. But I still think we should report it!
Hold up. The third car is vegan.
No, it's the BLT.
Take this sub, none of the BLT's are running.
I'm not sure this is going to solve the rat problem.
If we could all just agree to call it a hoagie, then we wouldn't be in this strange picture...
Looks like we'll have to eat and run.
The B.L.T. line is always late.
Let's wait for the next one. This one already has everything on it.
You can see why Italian submarines were so ineffective during WWII.
I thought we were going to take the BLT line home.
Local hero. We need the express.
How do you know we're in the Meatpacking District?
You have to give Subway credit. Their sandwiches are always on time.
That`s the American, we want the Italian.
Well, you said the MTA needed a hero...
Stay back, Rutherford. Don't try to be a hero.
Wow, a Subway subway!
Let's wait for the next one—you know I'm vegan.
I was waiting for the Orient Express, but this looks like the Neapolitan local.
It's a long ride, but lunch is included.
Nope, we need the Reuben
Ooh, the new 600-ft. long!
I thought you said we were catching the A train to get something to eat?
Honey... I told you size doesn't matter.
It could be worse. We could be in Boston where they're grinders.
Just say you took a late lunch.
Well, it is the BLT line.
The corporate takeover of our failing infrastructure."
Great, lunch is on time.
Is that the cheesesteak to Philly?
No, that's in Philly. Here it's a sub.
This is Jared’s fault.
If we wait 24 hours we can take the leftover train for half price.
Be careful what you wish for
That's not ours, it has cheese.
''It's a new line... you're back home in 30 minutes or it's free.''
Where’s the gluten free line?
Let's not sit near the onion this time.
Public transportation gets more and more cheesy.
Attractive. Aromatic. On time. DeBlasio might be on to something.
I told you we should’ve gone for a wok
Sigh. The daily grinder.
I was thinking Chinese
This one goes to Jersey, Mike- for Philly we need a cheese steak.
That's the express to Coronary.
I say we wait for the Taco Express.
It's really crowded at lunch time.
Do you want to wait for the vegetarian downtown sub?
Must be the new crosstown feeder train. Let's wait for the L.
I think it came from Philly.
Have you noticed? The subway rats are getting bigger and their delivery orders are getting bolder.
We don't need another hero, we just need to know the way home
I don't think I can stomach the ride.
The mayor did promise subway improvements.
I think Marvel's taken this whole Superhero thing a bit too far.
Why is the reuben running on the ham and cheese line?
I didn’t think that when they legalized pot here that I would hallucinate quite so much.
Excuse me, Sir. Is that the BMT or the BLT?
We're waiting for the one with no tomatoes.
...and they warm it on the third rail.
We missed the gravy train, now we'll have to get sandwiched on the subway.
Oh, a 'subway.' I get it. That's pretty funny.
I always wondered how it got that name!
No, dear. We take the 6”.
Only you would take the MTA to the OTB on a BLT.
Wrong Subway!
It got the sub part right.
This product placement is getting out of hand!
Let's wait, the next one should be whole wheat.
The Coney Island and the gravy train are on this line too.
I expected to be sandwiched in, but not so literally.
UberEats is getting so convenient!
Let's wait for one with less mayonnaise.
Folks in this city are so LITERAL.
Let's wait for the whole wheat.
No. We are waiting for the turkey on rye.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to sesame seed?
That doesn't look kosher to me.
Wait for the meatball sub to take us to Little Italy.
Let's wait for the number 4, it has no onions.
Sure, it's slow and smells bad, but hey, this is New York.
That's the turkey. We want the spicy Italian.
Something's not kosher. We better wait for the Corned Beef Special.
This must be the Bread Line.
And that’s just the dining car.
This is ridiculous. I clearly said “no tomatoes.”
I thought this was the BLT line.
Wait til you see the ones sponsored by Taco Bell
Food's good, but the service is lousy.
Another salami on ciabatta?! Maybe we should just take it.
Don't take it--the 12:15 is organic.
They say it comes uptown faster than it goes downtown.
Let's wait for the vegan one, there'll be plenty of room.
That's not funny
Let's wait for the desert car.
I gotta hand it to you, this is one helluva first date
Hold it, that's a hoagie. We're waiting for the Philly.
We gotta wait for the next one. I'm trying to avoid gluten.
This definitely won't solve the rat problem.
Change to the Whopper at 42nd Street.
Let's wait. The express is whole wheat.
No. It’s the Gravy Train we want.
We want the six-inch to Brooklyn.
Aren't they taking the name a little too literally?
Is this the B, the L, or the T train?
Let's wait for a pizza.
Let's wait for no mayo.
I told you we shouldn't have ordered a whole subway just for the two of us!
Oh - wrong platform. To get downtown, we need to take the 7:10 ham and cheese.
It's amazing what can be done with a 3-D printer and some advertising.
Whose foot did they measure???
They're calling it, "The President."
Oh, honey, I think the other side of the tracks is gluten-free.
I think I’ll wait for the foot-long.
It may be slow, but it's kosher.
Nope. Too literal.
I thought Fridays was tuna fish.
What kind of hero still takes the subway?
These days everybody wants to be a hero.
Let's wait for the nine grain.
ANOTHER local hero on the express track.
Martha, I don't care about your gluten sensitivity, we need to be there in twenty...
That one has onions. Let’s wait for an express.
It’s the latest Christo, ‘Moveable Yeast’.
They did say Subway might go under.
I love their sandwiches, but where do you sit?
Behold, a true hero!
It's not the hero Gotham deserved, but the one we needed.
Grab this gentile express, or wait for the kosher local?
No, we are waiting for the pastrami on rye.
Well, this wasn't what first thought when the guidebook said the subway feeds the city.
Let's wait--the next train's gluten free.
I thought you said this line was vegetarian.
Wow, great product placement!
THAT'S the new Subway line?!
These new trains are a bunch of baloney!
OK I get it, but where’s the door?
So that's where they got the name.
The Italian B.M.T. always runs late.
That is one bad visual pun.
Don't get on. It looks too full.
I told you we should have taken the BLT.
I'm waiting for the uptown express. It's vegan.
At last it's on a roll!
They wonder why they have a rat problem.
Talk about product placement!
It’s free but you have to ride as a topping.
Look at the size of the rat dragging that 'sub'!
Is this the original Subway?
Shows you what can get done when the public and private sectors work together.
The mayor ordered a new subway train on the wrong form.
Look, Harry. The first color cartoon!
I'm sure the Coney Island will be along any minute.
I'm pretty sure this is the wrong subway.
Guess we will have to eat on the go.
Are you sure we're in the right subway?
That must be the BLT train. Ours is the PBJ.
Let’s take the next one. This one is too full.
I think the gravy train arrives at platform six......
We want the "L" line, not the "BLT".
Service has gotten so bad. We need a hero.
We're heading uptown, so we need to catch the turkey with mayo.
I hate corporate sponsorships!
“We can switch to the bagel at 42nd Street”.
That’s not ours, we’re waiting on the 6 (inch)
I hope the pastrami is not running late.
I thought the one with tomato was UPTOWN.
I never thought I'd live to see them finish the Second Ave Deli line
O.K. -- corporate sponsorship has gone a little too far.
Now I understand why you guys call it the subway
Subway is expanding
In the old days, this was called the "BLT Line."
Not sure now. Used to be $5.00.
I bet it still smells like urine
I’d heard of the IRT, the BMT, and the IND, but never the BLT!
It’s part of Trump’s new infrastructure plan.
I heard about this...it's Elon Musk and his Hyperloaf.
Not bad for $2.75.
So that’s what they mean by Subway
Ugh. Privatization.
You know how I feel about mayo...we'll just wait for the next one.
I'd just as soon go back up and hail a salad.
The train traffic on the MTA is becoming increasingly hard to swallow.
I think that's the 4:55 westbound BLT.
I thought he was an out of towner too when he said to take the Broadway BLT.
The graffiti on this line's gotten much more sophisticated.
Nice buns
Sweetie, let's wait for the next train. I don't want to be sandwiched in.
Tell me again. Why do we call it "fast food"?
Nope, ours is the #12 with mustard.
I heard the new cars were made in deli.
Let's wait for the uptown gyro.
It's too full. Let's wait for the next one.
Let's wait for the Express. It's pastrami on rye.
No, we still call it a Subway station.
I can't keep is straight dear. Is this literally a subway, or figuratively?
Boy, they weren't kidding. The $5 Subway IS a good deal.
What say we catch that Hoagie to Muskogee?
Ah Subway. Now it all makes sense.
Over an hour late. I’m not even hungry anymore.
That's the uptown BLT local, we'll wait for the Tuna Melt express.
The trick is to find a caption without the word subway in it.
Let's wait for the next one, I'm off gluten.
Let's wait for the triple-decker club car.
Should we take this one or wait or wait for the meatball express?
I thought Banksy was a vegetarian.
I knew they were looking for a hero to fix the system.
Oh, it's the weekend. I forgot the salami is running on the turkey line.
It has mustard. We'll take the next one.
Looks like the rats won their petition.
Are you sure that's the BMT Line?
Oh look, the President’s Food Stamp reform!
The subway has really lettuce down.
Lunch now arriving on Platform 14.
Ah, I see the 7 grain is right on time!
Oh no! Honey, the uptown arteries must be clogged again, this is usually a vegan train!
It takes fast food to a whole new level
It's gotta be the new dining car
Can you believe we still can’t eat on the train?
Subway must be running a hell of a Groupon deal.
Ah! Now I know where this place got its name.
That is definitely not a lo-cal.
It does look appetizing, but do you see a door, because I do not see a door.
I think Subway is taking itself too literally.
This "corporate sponsorship" thing has gone too far.
Too packed...let's wait for the next one.
This isn't our train, we are waiting for the 6 inch express.
It's the new 500 foot long from Subway.
Ready to take a hero's journey?
Let's take it, it runs like a hot dog after 125th.
Uptown gluten-free now boarding.
Is this the BLT?
They always get it wrong. I ordered a #7!
There is a downtown salami and cheese arriving in 2 minutes
Who knew Subway delivers?
I think we are in the wrong subway.
We need to sit in the no onions section.
C'est ne pas un sandwich.
Big difference between London Underground and New York Subway.
Service on this line is really sub par
Look, a track meat.
This must be the one to the mayo clinic
"Wow. This really must be the subway".
We all live in a yellow submarine!
We are dead meat if we go in there.
Don't worry, we'll ketchup.
We should say something.
I hear it runs on vinegar and oil.
Oh my God, David! New York is AMAZING!
I finally got this subway system figured out. We don't want to take that one. It has extra prosciutto and is going to Little Italy. We take the next pastrami on rye to the lower east side.
No, I'm trying to stay off carbs, not get on them.
I told you the foot-long wouldn't be the end of it.
this one is coming from the meatpacking district
Let’s take a taxi. I hate feeling sandwiched in.
Let's wait for the bánh mì. It's express and the seats are softer.
With the price of steel, Subway won the bid
I think the MTA partnership with Subway has had some unintended consequences
Honey, Let's wait for the Gluten-free one.
1.Let’s wait for the meatball express. 2. We’ll get a beverage at the transfer. 3. Is this the train to Little Italy? 4. We need that new Meatro card.
BLT? I always thought it was the BMT.
Let's take the next one. I want extra turkey.
No, son. Let's wait for the whole wheat.
A real hero, jumping on the track like that.
Well, this IS a subway station.
Late again -- but at least not packed like sardines
I’m waiting for the 5:20 - it has more mayonnaise.
I've always heard that heroes can be found in the strangest places.
Subway has gone too far.
I only ride vegetarian.
I literally cannot digest what I'm seeing.
The guy who gave us directions sent us to the wrong subway.
Since When Does the Salami Run Local?
Let’s wait for the panini.
On this line MTA stands for mayo, tomato, and arugula.
This is a bit too literal for my taste.
At last, a subway sandwich that really moves me.
It runs on oil and vinegar.
I hope Nathan's doesn't hear about this.
How's that for express delivery!
Hey Carmichael! Better a subway in a subway, than a grinder in a grinder, than a torpedo in a torpedo, than a hoagie in a... Carmichael.
Let's wait for the artisanal car. Everyone's always less kneady there.
They say the toasted version is even faster.
Back to the daily grinder.
Let's wait for the next one. I don't like mayo.
That's strange... I didn't think the B.L.T. ran local on weekends.
Now I know why the fare has gone up to $5.
Ugh, crowded again. I feel like a piece of meat on this thing.
It's usually much busier during lunch hour.
We must have gone to the wrong Subway
Let’s wait for the gluten-free line.
This isn't ours...ours has pepperoni...
The rat lobby is getting out of control
I guess after Jared Subway really went under
I don't care if you're a vegan. This is our only ride out of here.
The unforeseen side-effects of a 24/7 news cycle and legal marijuana.
I'm so hungry after my colonoscopy, even the subway looks delicious.
I suppose it's better than being packed in like sardines!
What time’s the one without mayo?
Talk about getting sandwiched on the train.
Let that one go- I want Gluten-Free.
I'll wait for the vegetarian car.
What? no Cheese?
Did you ever feel like you were living in a cartoon that needed no caption?
BLT? The sign said BMT.
It seems like we are about to get into a pickle.
Avoid the middle section; it can be overly stuffed.
Let's wait. The Gluten-free won't be as crowded.
It was supposed to be here at lunch time.
That must be the midnight special.
Stand clear of the closing jaws, please.
No wait, we want the Meatball Bacon Sub with Cheese to Lexington Ave.
Can we take the BLT line?
Wait for the next one, I don't want get sandwiched in.
It takes itself too literally.
This sub is called The Trump, even though it's YUGE, it comes with a micro pickle.
This looks like the BLT. We need to catch the PB&J.
It's rare when two companies can merge and still maintain their own identities!
Is this what you mean by the "meat-packing district?"
On second thought let’s take the bus.
Something had to be done since the steel and aluminum tariffs took hold. They call it Light-Rye-Rail
It doesn't stop at this station, it goes right to Little Italy.
I think the rats are going to like this new train.
It looks full but I think we can eat our way in.
When you ordered, did you stipulate rapid transit or fast delivery?
This must be what they meant by lunchtime delays.
Bill, I think we went to the wrong subway.
“Well it is a Subway, but it’s not what I ordered”.
Let's wait. The whole wheat with mayo is due in 7 minutes.
Not again? Another over stuffed NYC subway!
They bought it from the wrong Subway company.
No, let's wait for the panini.
Wait til you see the rats
It's a little too stuffed for me, let's get the next one.
Are you sure you googled the right subway?
Let's wait for the next one--maybe there'll be less Salami.
I think it's a subway.
Let’s wait for the gluten-free line.
I'm guessing we will have to take it to go.
Let's get on the next train. This one isn't kosher.
They certainly have made big Subway changes.
It’s not the hero we deserve, but it’s the hero we need.
The 3rd rail really crisps up the bread nicely.
The rats must be enormous.
If that's what I think it is, the $5.50 round trip's a downright bargain.
That must be the dining car...
That's not ours, we want the hoagie to Hoboken.
Not this one...ours is the Quiznos.
No, that's the Salami and Cheese to Little Italy. We need the Bahn Mi to Thai Village.
Step back! The jaws are about to close.
The new Metro service neither addresses the chronic over-crowding issues, nor the persistent rat infestation in the tunnels.
Well, they did say they’d change public transportation and eliminate hunger...
Maybe we should elect a new mayo.
Actually, I love the new subway sandwich train cars. Come my little tomato, lettuce squeeze in.
Let’s just wait for the next one... I don’t like the looks of that lettuce
Is this the train to or from Hell's Kitchen?
They have added a dining car
Ohhh... now I get it.
We'll have to wait for the next one. This one's not kosher.
Product placement has gotten out of hand.
No, no! The ‘A’ train comes with mayo.
Darn, I ordered a turkey with cheddar not the BMT!
That's all well and good, but how do we get on?
Excuse me Sir, is this the 4:10 from Liverwurst?
I told you portion sizes were getting out of hand.
Sandwiched in and it's not even rush hour!
Do you think Siri understood you wanted a sandwich shop?
That's just disappointingly literal if you ask me.
I told you the BLT would be packed at rush hour.
Did you bring the two for the price of one coupon?
That's the BLT train.
I told you this was the BLT-- the IRT is on the other side of Union Square.
Talk about catering to the lunch crowd!
Always fresh, never on time.
No, the next one is our’s. This one has pastrami.
This is the Ham and Swiss the Mixed Italian arrives at 8:05
That reminds me, Fred, your sister and her new boyfriend are coming for dinner tomorrow.
I thought we were in The Big Apple?
You did say you wanted it to go.
Should we get that to go?
It's not ours. I held the tomatoes.
It looks full.
Are you sure we can transfer before Flushing?
That's the Coldcut Combo to Brooklyn. We need the Spicy Italian to East Village.
You have to admit that the product placement is excellent.
So that's why the fare was $5.
No, you go ahead. I'm going to wait for the turkey and swiss.
I just ate. Let’s wait for the 1:15.
Can we order it to go?
The job sounds marvellous, but I can just see your commute getting stale very quickly.
This must be the wrong subway stop!
Do we really want to privatize everything?
Let's wait for the fast food -- it's an express.
It's one of those new Italian cars.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Looks like the BLT is running on the BMT line.
Let's wait for the next one, they are really sandwiched in there.
Jared said to wait for the footlong.
No, darling, it's just the IRT. You're hungry, that's all.
The 12:10 ham and cheese is right on time!
Just in time to catch the last subway.
Watch the gap between the meat and the cheese.
Is this the fast food line?
I've changed my mind Dear. Let's take a Taco Taxi.
There's no way it only has 6 grams of fat.
We can never seem to ride the subway without getting sandwiched in with everyone else.
This one goes to Little Italy. Let's wait for the meatball.
Let's wait for the footlong - it's the express.
No, the next one. This one's got mayonnaise.
Well, it is 'fast' food ....
Subway is working on its product placement.
Smells better than the EL.
Let's wait for the sourdough.
The onions can be a bit overbearing at close quarters, but at least they run on time.
This is not what I had in mind when you said we were eating at Subway.
Am I high?
That’s the 1:30 to Philly.
Oooh, look...! It's that new Hoagie Car, Michael!
Are you sure this is the yeastbound?
When you said "Hurry,....Come see the Superhero!", I was expecting something more like Superman.
Never visit a museum on an empty stomach.
I guess the BLT line is running local today
It's the new train they sandwiched between the Q and the R line...
It's their new sub: Under Ground Beef
No, that's the express to Little Italy, We want the local.
It finally hit me. Hoagy Carmichael. That's who wrote Stardust!
Product placement has really crossed a line.
Oh so that's why they call them Subs!
Sub in the Way
Let’s wait for the next one- I’m allergic to gluten.
I didn't know anyone actually rode the whole grain anymore.
Let's wait for a turkey on wheat.
No! I said let's MEET on the platform.
Are we going back on carbs?
And I thought it was fake news.
Go ahead. I'm holding out for a hero.
I'm sick and tired of the subways turning into sandwiches at the stroke of midnight.
Let's wait for the Burger Express.
Naah, the Spicy Italian is never on time.
Gosh. I didn't know Subway delivered.
Stand clear of the closing buns.
That's the turkey club. We need the Reuben.
I didn't know they allowed food on the train.
Shall we take the subway or wait for the bahn mi?
I was just getting used to the footlong.
Let's wait for the next one...this one looks stuffed.
All aboard! Next stop... Hell's Kitchen. Hell's Kitchen... next stop
I never thought they'd take corporate sponsorship so far.
Subway's out of service but I guess we can take a hoagie.
I'm not that hungry. Let's wait for the next one.
You’ve got to be a hero to make it through the subway these days.
It is the last Hoagy to Clarksville.
The BLT line is running with delays
Squeeze in behind those pickles, or wait for the next train?
You’re right, it’s longer than a foot.
Is that the hoagie car, Michael?
The Grinder goes from Grand Central to Connecticut, the Hoagie goes out of Penn Station to Jersey. This is just a Subway.
Can we take this home?
It goes straight through to the Big Apple.
I guess this train doesn't go to Nathan's.
Sweetie, Let's wait for the Express, it has pimento and cheese.
Should we take it to go?
I prefer lighter fare.
You did ask for it 'to go'.
I said "ride the train to subway for dinner" not the other way around.
My hero's come to take me away
Let’s wait for the 11:30 uptown BLT.
I thought they said the new steel tariffs wouldn't affect us.
"I see MTA lost the trademark infringement suit".
Now I understand why we paid with potato chips.
I TOLD YOU TRUMP WOULDN’T STOP NEW YORK CITY FROM GETTING A NEW SUBWAY”
This must be the Subway stop.
It's not our train. We want the pumpernickel.
I know the advertising revenue is important, but I still have trouble seeing the doors.
Figuratively speaking, that's a mixed metaphor, literally.
Rising costs meant they had to look for sponsors. It's called the New York City Subway(tm) now.
I don't think we'll fit with everyone sandwiched in like that.
No...Way.
Let's wait for the one with mustard
Even though the train wasnt crowded, John and Mary were still going to be sandwiched in.
Well, I think it's a hoagie.
Wait! That's not the gluten-free car.
No honey this is not us, we take the smoked turkey with swiss
I guess that order was 'to go'.
I am not riding in the salami car this time.
I hear they only run a foot-long during rush hour.
Not ours. We take the No Onion line.
Looks like the "subway" is packed.
Oh honey look it's that new Christo traveling art thing, he calls it the Monte Christo.
Is that the number 4 or the number 6?
Why only clog tunnels when you can also clog arteries?
Somewhat redundant, don't you think.
Looks like the 2:48 is a little oily.
Ugh, let's wait. Tomatoes.
'Good to see they've got the subways running on thyme.'
The Trump train is always full of bologna.
Did the one we came in on have cheese?
I'll wait for the next one -- I'm vegetarian.
They say a hero can come in all shapes and sizes.
The milk train has fewer carbs, but it doesn't stop here anymore.
The sub is filled, maybe we should take the bus.
I'll never be able to finish it in two stops.
I think it was better when they were covered in graffiti.
Edward was not convinced, but Betty was certain they were at the right Subway.
OK it's longer. It's still crowded and stinks in the summer.
It's local and it's artisan.
Hold the door and the tomatoes!
Thanks, Captain Obvious
Let’s wait for the 2. It’s pastrami and express.
Pizza rat was one thing, but this is ridiculous!
Won't be long, I suppose, before some sandwich artist comes along and covers it in graffiti.
I am taking this sub to the Yeast side.
If it’s with sardines I am not getting in.
Let’s wait for the next one; I’m not that hungry.
Let's wait for the Panda Express.
Let’s just get the next one - this one’s a damn sandwich.
Oh darling, this beats seeing the original Starbucks in Seattle.
The subway taken over by Subway. This privatization-of-public-services thing has gone too far.
That settles it. It's a sub not a hoagie.
Pretty much tops it for product placement.
The old subway car was toast.
The directions say to take the BLT to Midtown.
No, I don’t know where it goes and, yes, I’m getting on. Follow me.
That's unbelievable. A BLT on the local track?!"
This subway ends down at the mouth of the Hudson.
Well, I guess when he said meet on the train he wasn't kidding.
Wait - how many calories are in the 12” southbound pastrami ?
This is the underground subway that I was telling you about
No, that’s the Italian, we’re looking for the BLT.
I think we should wait for one without mayo.
Just don't ask to use the restrooms.
What did I tell you, Harold? Privatization never works.
We're better off waiting for the uptown artisanal.
I’d heard 14 was the buffet line.
I heard that the Subway franchise just bought the MTA.
This is taking corporate sponsorship too far.
Lettuce, tomatoes, onions,--hold the train
Thats one way to keep my diet on track
Those Subways are everywhere.
No wonder we have a rat problem.
Do you know where the gluten free track is?
No, this is ham. We want turkey.
We need more gluten-free transportation systems
Let’s wait for the next one.
Well, it certainly doesn’t solve the rat problem.
Ooh, gluten, processed red meats, not too much green stuff! I could get on board.
Oh good, lets take the dining car.
They have a long way to go, but the're on the right track
I don't like fast food, let's wait for the local.
These sponsor placements have gone too far.
No, that's not ours. We need to catch the meatball line to get to Queens.
Is that the new BLT line?
The mayo is being held momentarily.
Something doesn't smell right. Let's wait for the next train.
You sure that's the BMT? I think I see Turkey.
Looks pretty good for a 100 year old subway!
It's called the Subway subway.
Must be heading to White House.
First it's fake news, and now it's fake transportation?
You may not like pastrami but we'll get home faster.
This isn’t what I ordered.
Subway is introducing its new line -- the BLT.
I think this is taking corporate sponsorship a little too far.
Look, its the A train express to heart disease, obesity and early death.
....AND, it's on time.
We missed the meatball, but if we wait 5 more minutes we can catch the mortadella.
Let's just wait for the gluten-free.
It goes through the underbelly of the City.
It's the IRT; we need the BLT!
What were you talking about exactly when you said, "let's go to Subway?"
Looks like they finally added a Dining Car.
On the other hand, they got rid of all the billboard ads.
Due to a signal malfunction, lunch is now served.
The hero's journey
They keep increasing the subway fare.
Trust me, the BLT line is probably even worse
We could have gotten the Subway Special for half the fare!
I think we're looking for the southbound vegetarian.
I'm waiting for the salami on rye.
I say we split one.
You have to cut through a lot of baloney to get anywhere around here.
Wait, the next one is kosher
Let‘s agree on this: If it‘s not vegan, we are not getting on it.“
These new subway cars aren't really my taste.
Whenever I traveled, my mother always told me to take a sandwich.
Oh good, it's the dinner train
Yeah the sandwich is big but didja see that rat pulling it?
Subway's getting pretty aggressive with their advertising...
This must be yours. I ordered mine with provolone.
Well, a hero has arrived to save us from these dark times
It's so late it's gone stale.
He did promise to make a huge investment in our infrastructure.
This is the Italian. We want the Express.
Please, don’t state the obvious.
Lettuce on!
Must be the train from little Italy
If you don't call it "the Train" everyone will know your from out of town.
Subway, gyro, whatever. All I know is, it’s late again.
Oh, so that's how it got its name.
Doesn't look like a Subway to me!
They did say it was going to get worse before it got better.
This city really knows how to put the sub in subway.
The Express comes with a drink and a cookie.
Don’t get on this one...we want the Meatball Marinara
We should just take it. I heard the G train weekend service is a tuna melt.
I wonder how many people outside New York will get this?
Does it ever strike you that our transit system has become massively sub-standard?
Literally!?!
That is definitely more than a foot long.
When they start sending in food for the wait, you better walk.
Does this mean we can order a hanger steak at the airport?
So, Amazon bought Whole Foods, and now Subway just bought subway?
Let's wait for the Ham and Cheese.
Not this one -- we want the 6-inch to Flatbread
Do you think if we got on we could be heros?
Remember when it only cost $5?
These public-private partnerships have gone too far.
I knew you were in a hurry, so I ordered to go.
I never thought that Christo would sell out.
Yes, we made America great again!
At least it smells good
Well, I’m no fan of pastrami, but we’re running late, so let’s take this one.
Is it just me or are they getting smaller?
Let's take a different subway. I'm doing Paleo.
Wait, the local is gluten free.
Still... for $5?
Let's take the Pastrami to 42nd, grab the Meatball to Queens, and then we can just jump on the Ham and Cheese there.
Do you want that to go?
Let's wait for the gravy train instead
That's the BLT, not the BMT
Let's wait for the special...
Let's wait for one without mustard.
Let's wait for the tuna special - this is a local.
I thought they said it was only a foot long
It’s only a metaphor.
What do the Taxis look like here?
No, ours is the hot meatball to Queens.
The local is less fattening.
Are you sure this is the right subway?
It's the new Lunch Line
Looks full - let's catch the rye.
Too many carbs, let's wait and take the next one.
Let's get it to go.
Last time I ask Jared for directions.
The American is running local, let's take the Italian.
Italian subways are confusing.
This one’s a local. The cheesesteak express should be along any minute.
Only in the Big Apple.
Looks like we’re going to be packed in like sardines again.
It may not improve the percentage of trains arriving on time but it might make the wait more palatable.
At least it's better than the breadline.
This wouldn't have happened if we had just let them ban the big sodas
but is it still good to eat after 5 seconds on the subway floor?
The boys in Set Design are smoking pot again ...
Let's wait for the footlong.
Next stop: Indegestion
The next stop is the bathrooms in Penn Station.
I think we should wait for the tuna melt.
Literal is not always practical.
Don’t worry. It’s locally sourced.
It's my first all-you-can-eat train ride.
It’s not the IRT but the BLT line.
You should see the Coke that goes with it.
Wow, they have taken fast food to a whole new level.
I just think we are so hungry that everything is starting to look like a sandwich.
That's more than a foot long.
Suddenly three dollars for a sub doesn't seem so ridiculous
The new subway design makes it more appetizing
Here's the train to Little Italy.
Express lunch?
Not this sub dear, we want the toasted one.
Well, if we get stuck...
There goes my hero.
Do we eat our way in?
I don't believe my eyes, this subway's on time.
Let's wait for the gyro.
Probably toasty as hell in there...
This one must be to go.
It definitely came from a Subway, but where's it going?
They send the foot-long during rush hour.
Are you sure this is the right subway?
I'm still not sure about this new subway marketing - "mass trans fats" - but we'll see if the public eats it up or not.
Not that one! It's got everything on it.
Hurry! My subway app says indigestion will arrive in...3 minutes.
'Figuratively', not 'literally', dear
Do you think they'll be mad if we send it back and ask for another one?
Let's wait for the lettuce wrap.
I think I’m going to wait for the ham and cheese at 3:10.
We just missed the turkey club.
Looks like more delays on the BLT line...
While I don't usually object to product placement, Subway has gone too far.
Oh, great, does this mean that the price to ride the subway is 5 bucks now!?
I said Chinatown not little Italy, give me the map!
Look, Charles, it's the 4 'clock Hoagie.
Not this one - we're on the pastrami.
Boy, have these cartoons become literal.
Looks like they forgot the mayo, but at least it arrived on time.
Let's wait for one that's less packed.
Let's wait for one on whole wheat.
I thought the MoMA exhibit was last week.
Wrong train. The 10:05 offers Kosher dills.
Wow, it actually made it on time for lunch for once.
Looks like the express is running as a local hero.
We have to take this one. The black forest ham is making only express stops to 125th Street.
I don't think it's kosher, Lenny.
Is that the A/C/E or the B.L.T?
Let's wait for the seedless.
Let's wait for the next one; this one's stuffed.
Hmm, I think we should just take the Panda Express.
Let’s wait for one without onions.
Well, there goes dinner.
These corporate sponsorships are getting way out of hand.
How can something so wrong feel so right?
See, I told you! We catch the uptown meatball on the other platform.
This is my kind of Subway.
I was waiting for a #5 Uptown, but I guess a #6 with pastrami will have to do.
It's the express. No tomatoes.
Still smells like urine, although now with a hint of honey mustard.
No, No, it's not a grinder.
I hadn't planned on taking a submarine to Penn Station!
Sure, I know it's a lot to eat, but we can take the rest home.
In Philadelphia that would be a hoagie.
Hold on. I don't see the conductor -- or is that him under the avocado?
I'll wait for the gluten-free line.
I think it's going to Little Italy
We should wait...the whole wheat will be along in a minute.
Attention subway riders : eating in the car is permitted. Eating the car is not
The express comes with prosciutto.
Oh, it's a mayonnaise. Let's wait for an oil and vinegar.
Now they're just mocking us.
The last car has more cheese.
Hope you're hungry! This is the first stop on the Buffet Line.
Let's wait for the Ruben.
I just love the Whitney!
Let's just take the next one.
Great, another wannabe subway hero.
You know I'm gluten-free...We'll have to walk.
At this hour, it is always a meat fest.
Not ours. Our has cilantro.
It's huge!! I bet it goes to Trump Tower.
Golly, I didn’t know Subway delivers.
This might cause my diet to go off track.
It's true, then—Subway and the subway have merged.
Half the city is off bread, so it's never crowded.
I guess we can't take it today. It's no meat Friday.
Let’s wait for the next one, it might not be as filling.
Everyone in the Village warned us not to go above 14th, but you will never listen.
I heard Subway now "Supersizes".
Let's sit near the front, there's less pickles there.
If you finish one, you get a second one free...
These subway ads are getting a bit extreme.
That must be the sub to Little Italy.
Let's wait for the gluten-free train.
And that's BEFORE they supersize it!
I think it's a nuclear sub!
Fred this reminds me, we’re almost out of toilet paper.
Wow, how much does that sub weigh? (Hey, if the New Yorker can pun, so can I.)
I don’t understand. This cartoon is complete and does not need a caption. Was this a mistake?
Wasn't it bad enough when the trains just smelled like a big, greasy sub?
Look at that hoagie car, Michael!
It's a mirage; the 6 train is never as delicious as it looks.
Not bad, only $2.75 for a 200 foot-long.
But that's what the sign said.
I wonder about the roll of advertising in our society
Let's wait for the No. 3
Looks like we trade less congestion for more indigestion.
You can't beat that for product placement.
This is the best smelling train in Manhattan.
Let's wait for the Veggie Delite.
If its not vegan and gluten free I'm not riding.
I always wondered how that was named.
It's a subway...It's a sandwich...Genius!
Let's have a bite and then go home
Is this your idea of our lunch date?
Does this subway go to Philly?
I wonder if I can get mine "To Go".
Problem is, every time the doors open a tomato slides out.
Don't say it. Don't even think it.
If you are going uptown I wouldn't get on. It's almost impossible to get a hoagie above 14th Street.
Its either the BMT, the IRT, or the BLT special.
No, no, the express doesn't have lettuce and tomatoes.
They're not very subtle with the subliminal advertising, are they?
I flew Blimpie to Chicago.
The MTA is exploring franchise opportunities.
It's delayed--they're holding the mayo on the A line.
Let's wait for the local, otherwise we'll be sandwiched in.
No, we need to wait for the vegan.
Hey look! It’s one of those all-you-can-eat trains!
Too many carbs. Let's wait for the lo cal.
The veggie sub doesn't stop here. This is a meat station only.
~Hold on, lets wait for the Italian B.M.T to Brooklyn"
I have to transfer at Times Square for the Turkey and Swiss
You’ll be able to get an olive by 96th.
It looks like this town is full of literals, not liberals.
Let's walk. I think the next station has a vegan train.
The graffiti is so convincing.
You said it would be like a sardine can.
Finally, a subway I love.
Looks like we just missed the Rye.
I hope you realize the winning caption to the gingerbread person cartoon announced in the 3/5 issue is plagiarized from a recent issue of AARP magazine
I really thought you were kidding!
Aww - I told them "No Tomatoes"
Mind the mayo
This is the Spicy Italian Local line, our train is the Cold Cut Combo Express.
It takes a hero these days to ride the sub ways.
The new Secretary of Transportation owns a number of franchises.
The next one—this one's too stuffed.
Something's off... Why are we the only two here?
Phew. I was worried we'd get stuck on the tuna.
You see, this is why we call them hoagies back home
There really is a subway on every corner now!
Quick! Get on! The next one has mustard.
I Love this new Guggenheim Exhibit it’s called “Yes Literally!”
Let's wait for the local. I need to cut down on fast food.
Open sesame gets you in
I feel safer now that Jared is gone.
You want kosher, you go local."
We transfer at Coney Island for the jumbo hot dog.
Look, the top one percent left us more than just crumbs!
Nah, there'll be a Philly Cheese Steak along any minute!
At least this one is on time!
Next stop, Little Italy.
I think the new Subway System Director is taking his job too literally.
This is the spicy Italian. The ham and cheese is due in five minutes."
The schedule called for Pizza
Looks like they've opened the new B.L.T line.
Let's wait for the express. It has extra cheese.
I always leave smelling like this place.
The wonderful thing about this city is that you’ll find hero’s wherever you look!
Let's wait for whole-grain.
The six foot sub only comes at rush hour.
Hold on. The prosciutto with lettuce and tomato is a local.
These subway ads are really getting sophisticated. I can’t even see the door!
Let’s wait for the pastrami on rye.
They promise to fix the system, but that’s a bunch of baloney.
Maybe crumbling infrastructure isn’t always a bad thing.
These new advertisement wraps have gotten more realistic.
That's what I call a subway sandwich!
That's not the subway I know...
Did you say 'iconic' or 'ironic'?
It's the new public-private infrastructure initiative.
Graffiti these days - all technique and zero soul.
This cross-marketing thing is getting out of hand.
Let's wait for the turkey on rye
We're early, we'll wait for the corned beef on rye.
Wait. Let's see if the next one is a pizza.
It’s a subterranean.
Let’s wait for the next one... looks like everyone’s sandwiched in
It's the 8:20 to Sub-Urbia.
I think I'll wait for the low-carb car.
Kind of obvious, isn't it?
That’s the BLT express -Let’s wait and eat local.
But is it gluten free?
I hate when advertising becomes so intrusive.
'I thought this was the L train not the BLT train'
I was looking for the Second Avenue Deli, not the Second Avenue Subway.
Franchising the transportation system was a bad idea.
No, that’s the local. Let’s wait for the express, it’s fresher.
So that’s why they don’t call it the “Tube“, “Underground” or “Metro”.
This is all wrong, we needed the turkey reuben inbound.
I don't know if it's kosher.
It would be nice not to get sandwiched between two cars.
Let’s wait for the uptown tuna
It's better than the egg salad I rode last week.
Let's wait for the vegetarian. It's an express.
Did you wash your hands?
Years ago people used to ride on these things.
Must be coming from Little Italy.
That's the hoagie car, Michael.
It must be the express to Little Italy.
Let's wait for the local. It's whole wheat.
This was inevitable, once the fare went up to $5.
For ironic advertising it can’t be beat.
That's turkey, we need turkey club
Where’s the gluten free line?
This is the Veggie. We'll have to wait for the next one.
This sponsorship thing has gone too far.
Let's take the next one.
Wow...now that's what I call a subway advertisement...
It’s the express. We want the 6 inch.
Makes sense to me. Why else would they call it a subway station?
That's the sub to Brooklyn.
Finally, my Hero!
Hold on. It's the local, it has bacon.
You really can get anything in New York, can't you ?
I’ll catch the next one, I’m holding out for a hero.
Ugh, Lunch time is always so packed.
Well, at least this one was on time.
That's a lot of baloney
The vegan train is next.
They really ought to stop being so literal.
These product placement ads are getting out of hand...
Looks like that's one completely full.
If the product-placement campaign doesn't do it, there'll be a fare increase for sure.
Stop staring at that tomato!!
So that’s why we call this a subway stop.
We don't need another superhero!
Amtrak seems to think it’s a subway now!
Now we know who is sponsoring the Manhattan tunnel rebuild.
I thought it was the BMT.
His mouth is big enough, but his hands could never manage it!
Well, I guess it was inevitable after the way riders have been sandwiched in for so long.
Never take the subway at lunchtime
Let's wait for the multigrain.
This isn't us, we're waiting for the Gluten Free.
I get it, you don't have to harp on what 'literally' means
Well, we can stay and grab a bite, or take the Express.
Oh look, the new subway has arrived.
Next one should be the Rye Express.
Let’s wait for the turkey, cheddar and avocado. It’s an express.
Let’s wait for next one, I prefer going plain without tomatoes!
Subway's working today.
Christo has finally sold out.
What time are the chips and drinks scheduled to arrive?
No, let's wait for the baguette express.
I told you this was the wrong subway.
You know, I was hoping we would get the gravy train this time around!
I said no tomatoes!! Let's wait for the next sandwich.
The last one was packed with sardines.
It's a typical offering from a New York City Sub Station; great, IF you can get it to go.
Why must you be a po'boy? I knew we should've paid for the Uber.
A sub in the subway is no odder than color in the New Yorker cartoon contest
I knew this would happen if SUBWAY sponsored the M.T.A.
Let’s wait for the Pastrami Line.
Let’s wait, that one’s overstuffed.
It's the Hoagy Carmichael express
They toast it on the third rail...
Let's wait for the 'meatball express'.
'We can take the BLT to the J Z.'
Let's wait, maybe the next one will be a hamburger.
Too seedy for you?
I don’t know ... it’s not quite how I expected a subway to look.
Get ready to be sandwiched in again.
Excuse me, is that Hoagie to Newark ? Or the Wedge to Yonkers ?
The thing I hate about the subway is getting sandwiched.
How redundant.
Geez Ted, how many weight watcher’s points do you think it is?
Let's wait for the next one - hopefully it will be turkey on whole wheat
Who ordered the pastrami on rail?
Roast beef? Let's wait for the next one.
New York's biggest fast food-train, brought to you by the nation's biggest fast-food chain.
Let’s wait for the panini.
nah, wait for the meatballs and swiss; takes longer but fewer onions.
Wow! That must be the new 50 foot Subway!
Let’s wait for one with less mayo.
Relax, Insecure Man, you'll always be my hero.
The Subway has so gone down the Tubes.
I hope there isn’t mayo smeared on my seat again.
Wait, the express is on whole wheat.
I'm waiting for the one with no mayo
Now that's what I call a subway.
Let's wait for the steak and cheese. It's an express.
I think Banksy is getting too literal.
I know we're late Suzanne, but can we wait for the next one? I'm off carbs this month.
Where I'm from it's called a hoagie.
We should've taken the cannoli.
Subway delivers
The six-inch will be more crowded.
Must be the new Second Avenue Deli Train
It seems as though everything is conspiring to derail my diet.
See, with Uber you only get water and Altoids.
Are those edibles totally messing with me, or is that the world’s biggest metaphor?
We would have never made it if they hadn’t held the onions.
Open sesame?
I wouldn't mind it so much if the tomato slices didn't always insist on manspreading.
Maybe, we should just catch a taxi carb.
I think they misunderstood my “to go” request.
It’s tempting, but I’ll wait for the local.
The Italian Express just pulled in. I think I want to wait for the Meatball Special.
The graffiti artists are really getting good.
Now I see why New Yorkers don't call it the Metro.
Not this one dear. We need the meatball line.
Are there any gluten free options?
well it gives new meaning to sub station.
Let's take the express, I'm on a diet.
Maybe we should take the bus.
The tuna on rye never shows up when you need it.
Don’t worry, we can transfer for the lo-cal at 42nd.
This sponsorship has gone a little too far.
Wait. There's a reason no one's eating it.
lettuce ride together....I don't want to provolone
I know it’s the subway, but this is ridiculous.
The city gets a franchise fee, and we get mayo on our shoes.
Call me Ishmael
I like being able to loaf on the train.
Too many tomatoes. Let's wait for the next one.
Is this the foot long express or the 6 inch local?
The cross-town smells better than usual.
Jalapeños-- must be the express.
Do you know what they call it in Philadelphia?
They finally mastered the miracle of the loaves
You take everything so literally
Before corporate sponsorships, the subway was toast.
Excuse me Sir, is this the 4:10 from Liverwurst?
I thought its only job was to block human arteries.
Let’s catch the next one, this isn’t gluten free.
Let’s wait. I don’t want to get sandwiched into this one.
Wow, I don't think I've seen it so full.
Let's wait for the next one. It comes with mustard.
Not ours; ham subs only go to 42nd Street.
It looks like the merger was approved.
These advertising wraps are getting a bit too realistic
Can we wait for a gluten-free train?
Our question upstairs should have been more specific
This subway graffiti keeps getting better all the time.
Well it’s obviously not vegan so I’m waiting for the next one.
Looks like fast food... but is it an express train?
It's never a BLT when you need one.
Not exactly what I was expecting.
Wow, $5.95
Wake me, Ralph, I'm having another one of my gluten-free nightmares!
I don't care, it's late.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the downtown Ham and Cheese on Rye is delayed by signalling problems. As an alternative, take the Italian Hero to West 4th and switch to the Turkey Club.".
Isn't that just a bit too obvious?
Subway finally came up with a clever ad campaign.
Does the Footlong go to JFK?
Maybe I was in the wrong App when ordering the lunch express
Do we get in by saying ‘Open Sesame’?
Now I get why New York is famous for its Subway!
The 10:00 hoagie from Muskogee is in
Hold on, why is that thing the only thing in color?
This is not what I expected when you said we were going to take a subway.
(garbled intercom voice):"Please board the train when bready."
Let’s wait for the next train. It’s too early for lunch.
I'll take it to go.
These advertising tie-ins are getting ridiculous.
Now that's what I call a hero's welcome.
I hate caraway seeds.
Oh yea, it's how he came up with the name, SubWay.
Does this really make America great again?
We'll eat on the way.
The commute is a grinder
Some mergers just don't make much sense.
It means nothing, you're my hero.
I know what it looks like dear, but the British call it a tube!
This one has too much mayo, let's wait for the next one.
It’s OK. He said McDonalds is going to pay for it.
Let's wait for the next one...I'm on a diet!
The farmer's market has really expanded.
I miss the old artists.
That's the BMT honey. We need the BLT.
I'm the electric company had something else in mind when they made this their sub station
I said I wanted an IRT, not a BLT.
In which subway do you wish to be sandwiched?
The Governor wants to be considered a hero in improving the subways.
Yes, but sometimes a sandwich is just a sandwich.
Wrong Subway!
I don't care what anyone says, this subway is still seedy...
One sandwich to feed all the fans at the stadium was a controversial experiment.
No wonder they raised the fare to $5.00!
I told you, the subway is just for heroes now.
I think it's called the Midnight Special .
It's the new mile long from Subway.
Our car is sandwiched in back there.
I was told the Crosstown was a vegetarian line.
I don't know what they're thinking - this won't help the rat problem...
City hall mixed up the lunch and transportation contracts again.
This new subway is a lot of baloney.
The rats are now ordering out.
I think this train is headed to the upper wheat side
Okay; I'll bite.
Has the subway become more seedy recently?
Oh wait! I just remembered the name of that sandwich shop.
"We're at the wrong station dear.This is the BLT Subway Line".
In Philly we call them Hoagies.
Darling, mind the dip between the train and the platform.
I thought you said let's eat AT Subway.
Pizza rat's going to be so happy.
Downtown in 30 minutes? What a a lot of baloney!
I think they are taking their marketing a little too far.
Wait, that's the footlong spicy italian. We need to take the chicken tikka!
Well, it smells like the 4.
The whole thing is a dining car.
Now I get why you complained about heartburn over the privatization of the subway.
I hear the French have Baguette transit.
It's amazing what you get for five dollars these days.
You should see what they did to the Chrysler Building.
So when did the BMT become the BLT?
Can we wait for the Pastrami Express or the Trump Turkey Local?
Looks like we missed the lo-cal.
You're right: Subway does have bigger sandwiches.
Who'da thought when our ship finally came in it'd be a sub?
The problem is you can't eat onboard.
Go ahead, I'm waiting for the panino.
So that's why they call it the subway.
I have to wait for the next one, it's gluten-free.
Look; this train must be from Little Italy!
A #6 fully dressed is now entering the station.
I hope it's heated.
Let's wait for the roast beef on whole wheat.
Let's get a seat by the baloney!
I'll bet they catch the rat.
That car will really sandwich ya’ in.
The Express isn’t toasted.
No, wait... the guy said to get on at the Éclair.
Subway has really ramped up their new advertising campaign.
It's a new concept - a dining car.
See, we do have heroes nowadays.
Somewhere lives an advertising genius.
Well, at least it isn't tuna.
Trump Tower’s stockin’ up on baloney.
subways are finally running on time now that the deli's took over
Don't worry sweetie, the corned beef on rye will be next.
This one is to go, right?
It's not toasted. How could you forget to ask for toasted?
I see The Donald sub is making it's way to Trump Tower.
Let's wait for the gluten-free car.
Looks slower than Panda Express...
I didn't know the "L" train stood for "Literal".
I'm not too hungry. Let's wait for the local.
Well, the sign did say "Subway".
So that's why they call it the underground and we call it the subway.
Let's take the next one. I don't like wheat bread.
Let's wait for the next one, this one's packed with carbs.
Let's wait for the non-gluten.
What else were you expecting to see in a sub way?
Cabs are lower carb.
It's crowded but at least it's on time.
We don't want that one, it's the Black Forest Ham not the Uptown 1.
Yes, darling, "Meals on Wheels", is convenient, but the portions are too much for me.
Yeah, that's OK for armies, but I like wheels myself.
This is where the Jersey subs originate.
You know, every city needs a hero.
Let's wait for the next one. I really don't want to get mayo on my coat again.
Damn, was hoping it was the BLT train.
We'll never get to Brooklyn with this bologna.
Wow, so do we now have a President in the Oval Office too?
It's only the Local Fare. Let's wait for the Express Special.
Let’s wait for the foot-long Uptown. I hear there’s avocado.
I can see it's the BLT, but is it the express?
this is the BLT Express. To get to Little Italy we need to take the Combo Line.
This is the Express line." "Baloney
Honey, I think we found the subway.
Let's wait for one without mayo.
There's my hero.
No, lets wait for one with no mayo.
Looks like we’re going to be sandwiched in again.
Sponsored by Subway.
I guess this one no longer stops at the Carnegie.
This must be the train to Hogieboken.
As if being sandwiched on the inside wasn't enough...
Wow, look at the size of the new dining car!
I heard the dining car has a limited menu.
Hurry up! Maybe they can sandwich us in.
Late lunch again.
These corporate-sponsored subway remodels might be getting out of hand.
Must be a throwback car from the old Italian BMT line.
That's the Number 7 with extra pickle.
This is a new take on lunch to go.
I know what you said, Lenny. I just didn't believe you.
Now, here is a sandwich living up to its name.
That’s why they call it fast food.
This train is too literal!
Let it go. Ours is multigrain
No, let's get a local sandwich.
Let's wait for the Quizno's.
I know New York is a food city, but this is ridiculous.
In Japan, they've been living inside hoagies for decades.
Well, it is a subway sandwich, so this was bound to happen sooner or later.
This "corporate sponsorship" thing has gone too far.
On the plus side, they say it's clean, smells great and has gluten free seating.
It’s only in service until the rat population rebounds.
Let's wait for the tuna fish.
These public—private partnerships are getting out of control.
Let's wait for the next one. I asked for no lettuce.
The underground clubs are getting too avant-garde for my taste
It's this or the ferry.
I say we squeeze in and have lunch on the go.
The station is a lot busier around lunchtime.
Let’s wait for the next one. I’m a vegetarian.
This looks full. Ketchup with you later.
I don't care. I'm still calling it the Metro.
Nope, not us. We need the meatball sub.
Typical Subway. Ham then ham then tuna, but never a downtown turkey club.
Ever wonder what we did for a quick bite before the merger?
This one is stuffed. Let's wait for the next one.
~ "This must be the new Long Island long."
Sandwitched in there, as usual.
Gasp! You're right, the subway IS bigger in the city.
Stand back, we're in the carb loading zone.
This hoagie is completely stuffed, let's wait for the next one
That's the party train, It'll be down to one and a half cars by the time we get to Washington Square.
This one's stuffed. Let's wait for the Only Prosciutto.
No, dear, that's the #3. You can tell by the seeds.
I asked for no onions.
Usually the local is only six inches long.
I thought the chicken and bacon ranch melt only ran on weekdays.
Let's wait for the vegan option.
“that’s smart, it’ll make the subway delays more palatable”.
“I know, but will it still get us to Taco Bell on Lex?
Hey, Gladys, is this the local or the Midnight Train to Gorging?
Derivitave don't you think?
This better mean we can bring our coffee down here now.
Let's wait for the vegan express to Brooklyn.
Well at least it's on time.
They changed the decor to match the aroma!
Ceci n’est pas un Subway (with apologies to Magritte)
I'll bet you the rats don't let it get to Lexington Avenue.
I thought we needed to take the rye ?
What next? Airplanes shaped like virgins?
That's the local. The express has only meat.
Oh my, another hostile takeover!
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A SUBWAY SANDWICH!!
Faced with stiff competition from Amazon's drone food delivery, Costco is testing it's version.
This one looks packed, let's wait for the next one
Now you know why they call it "Subway."
Let's get the special.
Woah! Advertising on public transportation is out of control.
Did you hear? De Blasio has been taking money from Subway.
This is the only Subway in New York where you can get a decent Philly hoagie.
This one's packed, let's wait for the next one.
Ugh, I hate the lunch rush.
It's not a hoagie or a grinder, must be a sub.
That sub is an express. We have to wait for a reuben.
Turkey and Ham now arriving on track 1. Roast Beef will be arriving in 5 minutes on track 2.
Let's wait for one with less pastrami.
Sub-standard, you said?
Wrapping trains with ads is fine, but this is ridiculous!
Trust me, the Italian is more comfortable than the Tuna Salad.
I heard Subway was launching a new line and it was going to be huge.
What do I care? It's still 20 minutes late
The future is even more tragic than Orwell predicted…
Jeez . . . we waited and waited, but they still got my order wrong!
Nezt time we are driving into the city.
The MTA really needs to cut the fat.
Can’t compete with Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile.
Roll on, my hero!
Dibs on the window meat.
I guess the vegan car is further down.
Ohhh... now I get it.
So that's what the Italian subway system looks like!
This is the wrong line. We are supposed to take the footlong "Tuna" to Uptown and then switch to the 6'' "Italian Meatball".
I said Subway sandwich, not sandwich subway.
I hear the mayor ordered the new trains from the first company in the book named “Subway.”
This is the second time this week we missed our sandwich!
Let's eat local.
This train doesn´t come with chips.
Grinding to a stop will have a whole new meaning!
If we moved faster we wouldn't have missed the soup and salad
We should wait for the ham and cheese
It’s fully loaded - again!
They take their name a little too literally for me.
It must be the express to Little Italy.
An express train, you said. Won't stop again until Times Square, you said. Baloney.
Are you sure that's the number 14 bus to Rye ?
. . . There is a . . . downtown . . . Deli Special with Mayo and Onions . . . arriving on the local track . . .
Let's wait. There's an express meatball sub right behind this.
One wonders just how big the rat is that left that there.
It's the subway hero !
It's like the tax plan: 10% rich meat, and 90% bread for the rest of us.
Just think, we could save 15% or more on our car insurance.
It's the Lunchtime Express.
No, that's the BLT train. We want the C.
I always called it a hoagie.
It runs with a side of microchips.
As if the foot long wasn't big enough!
Let’s wait for the roast beef - it’s express.
Don't worry. We'll split it.
We're on the wrong platform; this is the uptown Pun.
Let's wait. This one doesn't look gluten-free.
The graffiti was done by a starving artist.
Let's wait for the tuna sub -- its an express.
So THIS is the new Metaphor Line!
I see they're finally taking delays into account.
They would never get the joke anyplace where they call them “heroes.”
No, I'd rather wait for the 8:10 smoked turkey and pepper jack.
We'll wait for the next one; it comes with chips and a drink.
One of those "subway heroes" from the nightly news?
See! I told you the "D" in D -Train stood for Deli.
Turns out, the public transportation really is substandard.
Wait, it's too obvious.
Not yet. Ours is veggie.
I think we want the Ruben for Scarsdale.
This commuter is a real grinder.
When I said I was holding out for a hero...
Billy Bob I guess "subway" means something else in the big city.
This track is reserved for poor boys.
Look honey, it’s that ‘subway hero’ we heard about on the news!
Oh, goody. It's the club sandwich car.
Let’s find the non-mustard car.
Don't you just hate product placement?
Not exactly generating a low carb footprint.
I thought they said the subway needed work, not 'the works.'
Oops! Wrong subway stop.
"Appeasement did not work with the Germans in World War II and it won't work with the rats today.
I prayed for a 'HERO' to fix the subway, not a 'GYRO' to fix the subway.
"They call it Ishmael." I don't know why? My guess...something esoteric.
Don’t worry, honey, you’re still my biggest hero.
You always said you felt just like meat on the subway.
You have arrived at the"Dagwood Station".
Mind the wrap.
Typical readers of the New Yorker
I’ll wait for the next one. This one has tomatoes.
Gene, let's wait for the next train. If we take this one we'll be in a real pickle.
No, stop. Let's wait for the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki.
I thought this was the soup line .
I thought this was supposed to be the BMT, not BLT.
42nd Street is better they have corned beef sandwich today
Hurry, our sub is here.
It's the new dining car.
No, this is the pastrami. We're supposed to take the turkey.
Let's wait for the Q. I hear it's meatball today.
Let's take the gyro instead.
I guess that's why they call it the subway.
I can handle the five-dollars. It’s the furlong that gives me gas.
That must be the number 2.
It looks odd but smells better than the old one.
I'd heard they'd subbed out some of the trains.
Let's wait for the next train, this one has onions in it.
Privatization of the system started today.
Well, at least it won't clog any of the system’s major arteries.
Yeah, Subway finally merged with the IRT. They project significant cost savings.
Smells a lot better than last week.
Oh, so that's how it got its name.
That's what I call raising the fare!
When public private partnerships for infrastructure go wrong.
I never remember - does the BLT run express?
It really is a meat wagon!
I never knew you were so literal.
It's better than a food truck.
Gee, Harry, it’s like our Subway back home, only bigger.
You did say “let’s get a Subway!”
Let's wait for the next one. This one has too much lettuce.
Don't get on--let's wait for the gluten free train.
I read something about Subway asserting it’s trademark rights.
Have you noticed that graffiti has become so literal lately.
Let's wait for the next one. Maybe it'll be vegetarian.
I know I'm not supposed to mention this, but I don't like being trapped in an ironic cartoon.
Subway's new delivery service is really over the top.
A BMT on the IRT? That's weird.
No, we’re taking the BLT train!
What else would you expect to see here?
Does public transportation feel more crowded to you? I don’t know why I feel so sandwiched in lately …
No caption necessary.
Talk about a Homonym!
I hope we didn't miss the local panini.
The means of transportation today is total bologna.
I think you pushed the wrong button on the elevator. This is sub-level parking.
I've heard of corporate sponsorships, but this is ridiculous.
It's the express to Little Italy.
Never thought I'd have to wonder if my subway was gluten-free.
I get the pun, but I don't like that it's a white flour bun.
Subway's ad campaigns are really getting out of hand.
I wonder if this one’s to go?
Well, he did promise in his campaign to make the sandwiches run on time.
I'll wait for the Low-cal.
The rats finally discovered online food delivery.
Hurry, maybe we’ll get a sesame seat.
Can't afford a taxi? Join the club.
This must be a health code violation
I'd be willing to share.
And that was the day Mankind realized that there /was/ a glitch in the matrix.
No, let's wait for the "No Onion".
They said the ride would be gluten free!
that's just the local; we want the Blue Plate Special
The Beatles song come true!
Subway has really expanded!
At rush hour they add a foot-long...
Not this one, honey. We want the one with no pickles.
At least it doesn't look jam packed.
It’s always the last car that smells like onions.
I guess the travel guide warning of being sandwiched in overstuffed trains is true.
Oh, this one takes you to the meat packing district
We need a different kind of hero in times like this.
Good. The next one should be the meatball.
One day it just beached itself. No one knows why.
I was hoping for an actual subway.
It looks really stuffed let’s wait for the next one.
Subway went a little overboard with this promotion.
I know they said to, ‘Take the subway’ but, do you think we could get away with just a little piece?
Wait for the local. The express is not gluten-free.
Fred, this is not infrastructure upgrade I was expecting.
Homonym Man struck again!
We're taking the B to the L to the T.
Not where you’d expect to find the Great American Hero.
I hope the salami seat is open.
Let's wait for the BLT, it'll be here in 5 minutes.
I know the city made a lot of money on the Subway Sandwich sponsorship, but don't you think they agreed to a bit too much?
Wait, whose was the #14 again?
Is it kicking in for you yet?
I thought take the B-L-T Train meant three different lines.
You wanna wait foe the Reuben?
I heard the contract was supposed to say fixing, not fixins.
We should have said ‘Fix our Metro’.
I think this is the wrong station because we need to catch the ham on rye to 85th Street.
You go ahead. I'll wait for the uptown cheese steak.
The subway car redesign is nothing short of heroic.
I like this new delivery system, but I did order small.
Oh, great. The Ham and Swiss is running on the Meatball Marinara line now?
Stuffed with meat, just like the last one.
Most... elaborate... pun... EVER. The MTA is really hamming it up.
That's what they call product placement!
So that's why the fare was $5.
No, let's wait for the Deli Express.
I guess the MTA is seriously competing with Uber Eats.
That's not what I meant by double entendre.
Dine here or takeout?
This product placement business has gone too far.
This one's always too crowded. Let's wait for the six-footer.
All aboard for the Chattanooga Chew Chew!
I wish they had kept with the ads on the inside. Just be thankful we didn't the one for Trojan.
Should we get on or in?
In Philly we call it the hoagieway.
Oh no, I wanted rye.
The sign said "Subway"!
The service is worse on the BLT.
I see the Subway Station has finally delivered.
But at least the quality of the graffiti has improved.
Subway's really stepped their marketing strategy
Is that one of those foot-long subways?
Hey, I’ll spring for a cab.
We're in luck! It's lunch time.
Let's wait for the 'meatball express'.
Let's wait for a turkey and Swiss. This one looks full.
You think the smell is bad now, wait til summer
If we wait 10 minutes we can take pastrami.
Don’t.
It's a foot-long. Better grab it.
I thought they called it a submarine not a subway.
Don't try to be a hero.
And to think that it all started with the foot long...
We’re late. Let’s hope they put some mustard on this one!
It was inspired by the Wienermobile.
Ham! Kosher is always the next one!
Do you think that’s your Grindr date?
This isn't kosher.
That's what a Hero looks like.
There are no heroes on this line.
Don't worry, it's gluten free.
The local has extra mustard and Italian dressing!
I'm dieting. Let's take the local.
Let's wait for the ham on rye express.
This is what happens when you give up carbs—you hallucinate.
You take this one, I'm going to take the veggie.
Performance art is getting way too literal.
Let’s wait for the next carb.
I think it's a Subway prototype.
That’s what happens when the city picks the lowest bid.
Where the hell is the C. We've been here over fifteen minutes.
Well, as long as it gets us to Philly.
That's not the hero we need right now.
Attention Passengers: BMT delays will continue through lunchtime.
Just don't try to be a hero this time.
That’s the local, let’s wait for the meatball express.
*sigh* fast food, it ain't
Wake up, Idiot, of course it's a dream...I mean, where are all the people?
I told you this stop smelled like onions!
Please stand at least two feet behind the sneeze guard
I'll have to wait for the gluten free train.
These new promotional gimmicks are far too literal for my taste.
At least it's on time.
What linguistic genius puts a sub-MARINE sandwich on rails under perfectly dry land? A tube steak in London--now that I could see.
Let's wait for the next one - I'm vegan.
You hungry? If we hurry we can catch the BLT.
Maybe we should just walk to the Bronx.
Wow, great grafiti!
Yes, the uptown comes with avocado.
I’ll wait for the next one with no pickles.
Should we go with the mayo, or wait for the mustard?
"I guess Subway has a few kinks to work out in their delivery system".
Ah, here it is, the block-long sub.
Let's wait for the pastrami.
I didn't know they delivered.
PLEASE...don't say subway....!
What will Subway think of next?
I specifically said “Hold the mayo.”
Why does my MetroCard offer additional side items?
Redundant!
We can wait for the veggie car.
Wait, that's not the BMT. I think it's a BLT.
What's next, five dollar fares?
Sorry, I’m vegetarian. Looks like we’ll have to try the C.
So that's why it cost five dollars....
Let’s wait for the next train, this one smells like onions.
Let's take the next one-- the lettuce looks sketchy.
Is this the express lunch?
I hope they held the onions.
It's still faster than the G.
Let's wait for one with less onions.
I wonder what the daily special is on the "D" line?
This must be the local. I hear the express has only ham and cheese.
Typical, it's mostly baloney.
Night of the Living Bread
Seems like Subway has added mile-long sandwiches to its menu!
Let's make sure we don't end up on the wrong side of the snacks again.
I was afraid that privatizing out infrastructure would lead to something like this.
Call it what you want ; but , it is a subway system.
Obviously, it's a Subway sandwich.
I smelled it coming.
I hear the dining car is fantastic!
Talk about squeezing in like sausages.
It's not just the local, it's locally sourced.
But you can't get it to go...
Now arriving... 3:10 to Sandwich
These restaurant promotions are getting out of hand.
If you ask me I think they used too much yeast in that Subway sandwich
I'd like to sit in the upper crust.
Which reminds me. Never drop acid on an empty stomach.
Where I come from, we called it an" Underground Sandwich"
It used to be only five dollars.
Must be the new Subway marketing tie in.
That’s a cool looking sandwich. I wonder what they call it.
Tempting, but we don't have time to be making all local stops.
Please step back and let the salami off first.
It's a slow commute but lunch is free.
I thought they'd discontinued service on the BMT.
Subway's guerrilla marketing strategy has gone too far.
Must be the "BMT"
Since Jared left, they've taken to some really in-your-face marketing gimmicks.
I am beginning to hate this new product placement business.
Darn, it's the Foot Long. I'd rather wait for the 6 Inch.
And on the lower level, the pizza line goes to Little Italy.
Maybe we should take the Panda Express.
It’s not full enough. I’m waiting for the next sub.
Let's wait for the next one. This one looks fully loaded.
Those train artist are really starting to impress me.
Yes, it's packed but is it gluten free?
Now this, Alanis, is ironic.
Are we in a Woody Allen movie?
Let's not take the subway.
Looks like we've arrived in Philadelphia.
Don't bother. The express comes with chips and a drink.
God help me, I want it.
Let’s wait for the BLT espress
Oh! King Kong dropped his lunch.
Is it local?
This can't be the subway station, it's too obvious.
Watch yourself; you can gain a pound between stops.
I hope there’s a seat. I’m starving.
Taking the subway always makes me hungry.
Should we take the ham, or wait for the salami?
No honey. Let’s wait for the Philadelphia cheesesteak.
Stand clear of the closing loaves.
I know this is the subway, but this is getting ridiculous!
This one’s too crowded, let’s wait for one without lettuce.
Wanna bite before we go home?
Lucky for us. The luncheon special just pulled in.
Let’s wait for dessert.
I still say these things are a recipe for disaster.
Is that the 6 to Little Italy?
That's not our train, it's the foot-long special.
Let's wait for the Black Forest Ham. I'm tired of the Classic Tuna.
I didn't know the BLT stopped at 14th Street!
I’ll wait for the 6:02 vegan express.
Are you sure that this the number 2?
We'll be riding a tuna melt when summer gets here.
Did Subway finally add a dining car?
I've heard that Subway is one of the fastest growing franchises in the world, but if you ask me, they've gotten too big.
I didn’t realize they were gonna be so literal about updating the SUBWAY cars?
So much for the foot-long!
That's definitely heading downtown.
Hardly a surprise when you think about it.
Better catch this one, the next is the gluten-free tofu cronut!
This one’s packed, let’s wait for the focaccia.
This is your brain on Trump.
Looks like the NYC subway finally got a franchise.
This is the downtown subway. The uptown comes with cheese.
Let's take the provolone & prosciutto line and transfer to meatball marinara.
Would you like to add chip and a drink to make your ride a combo?
No. Subway doesn't have bathroom. That's Starbucks.
The next train should be gluten-free, I believe.
Well this is more convenient then when I ordered from Blimpie.
No, that's the #7.
It’s getting harder to predict hostile takeovers these days.
Do low-carb diets cause hallucinations?
Let's wait for the gluten-free express.
That’s not ours. Ours is the Tuna on the east bound.
Theme restaurants have gone a bit too far.
This isn’t ours - I asked for no mayo.
Wait! The three-second rule doesn’t apply to the subway!
"Didn't we ask for rye bread?"r
Let's wait for the next one. I don't like pickles.
But if we wait for the gluten free, we will miss the whole wheat express to the Mayo
It may be slow in the city, but it goes through me in seconds!
Does this one go to Little Italy?
I guess that’s why they charged us $5 not $2.75
This is the express from Meatpacking to Flushing.
Nah, let's wait for the Metro-North to Rye.
Next stop, arteriosclerosis!
Well, this is certainly better than taking the grinder downtown.
I think it's a new kind of spam.
Oh my, now this is a Subway.
Those things travel right through me.
There's our sub-standard commuter line.
It's either this or an Uber on rye.
What's Elon Musk going to think of next?
I didn't know 'SUBWAY' delivered.
Maybe this will finally convince de Blasio and Cuomo -- who are both Italian by the way, not that I really think about that sort of thing -- to ride the subway
I hate when they put tomatoes on the train.
Say, do you think the next one will be gluten-free?
Well, at least it's running.
No, let's take cab. It always smells like garlic and onions in there.
Let's wait for one that isn't toasted.
No, we want the Tuna Express
I'm not too hungry. Let's wait for the local.
Those graffiti artists have gone too far this time!
I knew there was something sketchy about the ad saying "stuffed with meat"
That joke's a little obvious, don't you think?
Let's wait for one with jalapeños.
I said we should have taken a cab.
A mass transport system worth sinking your teeth into.
No wonder the cars always smell like stale vinegar
Must be Italian
Of course, in Philadelphia, it's called the hoagie.
Platform nine and three quarters, the Hoagiewarts Express.
Looks packed! Let’s wait for the Veggie
But the Veggie Deluxe isn't due for another 40 minutes.
This explains the rabbits at IHOP.
Branding has gotten out-of-hand.
I'll wait for the gluten-free train.
Well, they don’t call it that in Little Italy.
Morty, the downtown express always has extra mayo. Let's take the local.
It's going to take a hero to fix this subway.
Let's take the pastrami uptown
I hope that's just ad wrap.
This is why it’s called the sub way
Should we just wait for one that’s gluten-free?
Say what you want, it's a huge carbo footprint.
I need to start eating breakfast before heading to work.
Ugh, Italian Herbs and Cheese? We'll take the next one.
Not this one! It's got onions.
Look, I know how you feel about Subway, but you have to admit they're always on time.
This subway comes with everything.
Let's wait for the vegan express.
If you don't mind, can we wait for the car with the extra pickles?
“Subway” is too obvious, right?
This new mayor takes things so literally.
I can't deal with the gluten today, can't we get an Uber?
You HAVE to stop "liking" so much, Bob. These online-tracking, targeted-advertising people are ruthless.
Let's take the local, at least we can get a bite to eat.
Check the timetable honey, is this subway gluten free?
It’s the City’s way of dealing with the delays : Subway’s not on time? Eat it!
No way this is the express train. It doesn’t have enough calories.
I prefer the BMT line. Less mayo.
Honey, it's on a roll!
Hero's journey.
Sometimes an idea just shouts out at you.
Not ours. We're on the burger to Brooklyn.
Let's wait for the next one. I'm GF.
I hear the new trains are gluten-free.
I will wait for the number 7. It has more mustard.
It was always a risk to let both Subways have the same name.
Let's wait for the chipotle chicken.
They should have stopped at footlongs.
Oh...so that's why it's not called the metro here.
Capicola? This one must go to Little Italy.
I'm waiting for the meatball marinara.
Wanna' catch this one, or wait for the foot long with a free drink?
First a gingerbread house, now this?
Let's just be grateful that this promotion will end by August.
I’m not getting on if it isn’t artisan bread!
That is literally the last thing I expected.
The local food movement has gotten completely out of control
I guess we missed lo-cal.
Let’s not sit next to the Ham again.
Are you sure this is the New York Subway?
This one has mustard; let's wait for the next.
Who knew?
This Subway advertising has become ludicrous.
Let's wait for the burger, it runs express.
(This cartoon is so funny, it doesn't need a caption)
Oh, that's the train to Fatsville.
Damnit! My gluten-free life is just one hurdle after the other!
They've gone a bit overboard since the 11-inch sub scandal.
I never expected to see a submarine in a subway!
I’m taking the Vegan line to Brooklyn.
Let’s just wait here until the mushrooms wear off.
Is that train gluten-free?
Looks like we’re taking the Pelham B-L-T
The next stop is Flushing Ave.
The weekend service is getting weirder and weirder.
They said to expect being packed in like sardines.
Banksy really outdid himself this time.
When you're ashamed of your leaders and terrified about the future, everything looks like a giant hoagie.
And that's why I'm voting for Cynthia Nixon.
Ugh, we can never get a seat on the foot-long cars.
You go without me. I'm on Whole30.
Just when I thought the subway couldn't get any seedier...
Wait, I asked for no tomatoes
Let’s wait for the tuna salad.
I heard a deli on 2nd avenue was the lowest bidder for the new subsway cars.
Looks like we missed the 7:11!
It's the express. The PBJ local should follow shortly.
I think I'd rather just split a pizza
When you said we were going to the subway, I didn’t expect this.
Did you bring your pepper spray?
Let's wait for one that's been toasted.
No WONDER there are rats on the subway!
Derivative.
I heard about this new sandwich line at Subway.....
Let’s take the next one. Maybe it’s less stuffed.
There's a big underground fast food movement in the works.
Hang on. Let's see if the express come with chips.
Let's check the Uptown menu.
Looks like signal problems again.
A hero’s welcome.
Let's wait for the 6-inch
Oh. It's the subway!
It beats taking the grinder.
You are still by biggest hero!
I’ve heard of SUBliminal advertising but this is ridiculous!
This one has mayo— let’s wait for the next sub.
It Has to be the the dining car.
At least that guy Jared is no longer a conductor.
Wait, is that olive? I can't handle olive, we have to wait for the next one.
Here or to go?
Please stand away from the platform when sandwiches are entering or leaving the station.
This doesn't look very fresh. The Jimmy John's #7 should be here in about 5 mins. Let's wait for that.
They say the prosciutto is local.
Let's wait for the chicken salad.
Let’s take the Subway!
Doing Whole30 has got me seeing carbs everywhere.
When they said new subway service I wasn't expecting this
This one has too much mayo. Let's wait for the next.
We'll have to wait for the Nathan's hot dog to Coney Island.
Full of seeds, we'll grab the next one
I thought the express was tuna salad?
This certainly takes the subway food court concept a step further!
I'm cold. Let's wait for one that has been toasted.
Looks like there's some space under the baloney.
If that's fast food this must be the express track.
No, I'll wait. I don't like pickles.
And I thought Platform 9 3/4 was weird!
I've a hunch the train is going to be late.
It'e the BLT.
Let's wait for the open face Reuben to Rye.
Let’s catch the next one, it’s low-fat.
That explains the smell!
This is why I hate taking the Subway on Meatball Marinara Sunday.
This subway car looks full!
It's an augmented-reality pun.
"Ha, ha, subway, get it? Like the sandwich franchise. . . Some people think the "sub" in sub sandwich is for subway, but it's really for submarine, submarine sandwich. Anyway, I hope they move it soon.
This is denotational dissonance if I've ever seen it.
That's the Hoagie line. We want Subway!
Well, at least the rats are eating fresh.
We seem to have rented an SUB instead of an SUV.
Italian design, same poor service.
I like the new ironic format.
Smells stale. Must be a local.
Is it just me or does it always smell like onions down here?
Now that's a REAL subway sandwich!
You go on ahead. I'm going to wait for the Blimpie.
Do they think we wont notice its running late!!
Is th Lexington Ave. Express now a turkey-and bacon with Swiss? What if I'm kosher!
My guess is that the mustard and mayo go on at Astor Place.
Crowded, smelly, and with pickles?! I’m walking.
Hold my ham, honey.
We’re bready to leave. Hope they lettuce on.
Subway’s new Express Meal car
No, wait, I want to catch the next salad that pulls in.
Remember we're working on portion control.
Now that's what I call a sub station!
It's part of Trump's Infrastructure plan.
Finally, truth in advertising!
I wish he had put us in a different cartoon--this one is just so...pedestrian.
I shouldn't have skipped lunch today.
I have a 2 for 1 coupon.
I like when an advertisement fits into the enviroment.
Pizza Rat really upped his game.
Must everything be privatized?
It's like a 'play within a play.'
'They hold the mayo on the 8:14.'
Do you think these street art installations are taking things too literally?
Damn! No mustard.
Let's wait for Oyster Bar or Shake Shack, we did Subway yesterday.
Looks like the MTA/Subway Restaurants merger has gone through.
This is why you never shop for trains when you're hungry.
No, do not say it.
Well, the museum did say the exhibit was a yellow submarine.
I can’t decide if this is a commercial or just a bad cartoon pun.
Let’s wait for the next one. I prefer prosciutto.
This is insane. There are no doors.
You take this one. I'm waiting for the meatballs and tomato sauce local.
I don't care if it costs five dollars or two seventy- five, it's still a ripoff.
Hello! Now THATS graffiti art!
It's a Submarine, not a Subway.
I ordered dinner to go
We all live in a yellow submarine!
It's the new Subway.
Oops! Wrong Subway.
Look Henry, this must be the new dinning car.
Mind if we take the next one? I’m doing the no-carb commute thing.
Too bad I just had one for breakfast.
Or wait for the local, which has no mayo.
Did we just miss our pastrami-on-rye?
Subway Subway?
I remember when it just cost 35 cents.
Is that the Subway Express?
Who did you say they ordered the new subways from?
Can you believe they used to eat these things?
I thought you ordered the six-inch?
This is the dine & dash platform
Let’s catch the next one, it’s vegan
This subway's a lot slower, but the seats are delicious!
Well, I guess they're acting on the complaints about being sandwiched in
Well now they're taking this privatization thing too far!
I think they are carrying this realistic advertising thing a little too far!
Let's wait for the local. There's a lot more mayo.
The sub is beginning to live up to its name.
Let’s wait for the 9:30 gluten-free.
Now I see why we didn't board at Flushing Avenue.
Wait for the next one. Maybe it'll come with a pickle.
Smells much better than the "N" line!
The Carnegie's sandwiches were bigger.
Let's wait for the local. I'm trying to cut down on gluten.
Let's wait for the next one... it's supposed to have mayo.
Wait. We can catch the veggie option in about five minutes.
Let's wait for the local. It's gluten-free.
If we hurry we can catch the 12 inch.
Looks like wagyu beef and foes gras. It must be the uptown.
Are you sure this is the right subway station?
I don’t think this is the improvement Cynthia Nixon had in mind.
That's not ours--we godda wait for the Pastrami.
I just thought of a name for our new sandwich shop!
I don't know if I care for this literal art piece titled "Subway Train"
Hurry, it's the BLT!
Looks like that Italian company got the contract for new cars again.
No matter how you slice it, it's food for thought.
That's the ham and cheese sub. Let's wait for the pastrami on rye.
We just can't seem to get away from performance art in this town.
It's just the Lexington Avenue BLT.
We’ll take the next one, your cholesterol is high enough
That hoagie came to a sudden grinding halt. Po'Boy.
Let's wait for the meatball hero.
Mind the buns.
Let's just uber there.
This must be the new Bread Line.
Lets wait for the next one. I'm worried about the nitrates.
Is that the BMT or the BLT?
The rats are gonna love this train
Let's wait for the kosher one.
Let's wait for the one without onions.
Looks like the franchise, not the local.
At least the order was on time.
Yeah, it's one of the new cars: no graffiti.
Guess they had to do something after Jared.
I'd heard they were expanding.
This new schedule is cutting it pretty thin!
I smell prosciutto, it most be on the third rail.
This brings a whole new meaning to subway hero
Wow, those new Subway train decals are great!
Smells about the same.
Let's wait for the next one. This has mayo.
Even the rats don't like Subway.
Of course it's a fresh idea for meal-time riders, but it doesn't look rat-proof to me.
So this is what it means to "Make America Great Again"
Not ours...we're taking the veggie.
I'm more concerned that the turnstiles are supplied by egg beaters.
It's late because the footlong always takes more time.
I always wondered where they got the name.
It looks like this is the train to Sesame Street
Food's good, but the service is lousy.
Ladies and gentlemen: We are being held momentarily by the train’s dispatcher. The BLT will be moving shortly.
Let's wait for the next one. We don't want to be so sandwiched in.
Don’t be a poor boy, let us wedge on yond subway.
It's completely powered by rats.
Did you say $5 foot long or 500 foot long?
Now that's a slider!
Which end do we take to get off at 14th Street?
Oh and this is the better end of Alimentary track line.
No Honey. Remember what happened with the gravy boat.
Finally, some cross-marketing I can sink my teeth into.
This must be headed for Little Italy.
They've taken this ad campaign a little too far.
I asked for a hero on a white horse.
Not a hero, let’s wait
No, not that one. We're waiting for "no mayo."
... and that's why it's called "Subway"
I thought we were going to Pizza Hut...
Here's the 11:45 luncheon local - right on time!
It' s packed. Let's wait for the next one.
It's tempting, but we should wait for the express.
Well, that puts an end to the controversy over the name
Wait, the white is local, were better off waiting for the whole wheat.
I don’t think this privatization scheme is going to work. I always smell like onions after I ride one.
Let's wait for the BMT on wheat.
as soon as the door opens, slide under the salami
Honey, I am confused. Did we go into the subway, or into Subway?
Let’s take the next one. This one is too full.
Is this how they're justifying the 5 dollar fare?
Don't worry about the price. We have a coupon.
At least we got something when they raised the fare to five dollars.
What a whopper. Do you think it’s the President’s?
Wait 'til Godzilla sees this one.
I had a feeling he didn't understand my order when I called it in.
I guess gastro-literalism is the next big thing.
And to think, it's "Buy one, get one free".
No, that’s not ours. That one’s going to Bologna.
After all, it is a Subway!
It's a special line -- it'll take us the closest to Katz's Deli.
I hear he's already worried about reelection
Is now a good time to mention that I'm gluten intolerant?
I wonder if the city will get sued for trademark infringement.
Can we get something to go?
Subway’s advertising campaign has gone too far this time
What a bunch of baloney.
Let’s wait for one without sesame seeds
I'm not sure if y'all know how a caption contest works. See, the caption is already on this one.
I specifically said no tomatoes.
I heard Subway was going to make a big advertisement push but I never imagined this
Wow! ... So that's where Subway got their name.
Today, I'll wait for the meatball with marinara.
It's the local... let's wait for the Panda Express.
Do you think Subway is over-doing it with their marketing?
The Italian goes Uptown, you want the Roast Beef.
This wasn't really what I had in mind when I asked to be pointed to "the subway"!
...Yeah, let's go ahead. I have a couple recipes I'd like to try if there are any leftovers.
Talk about freaky fast delivery!
I liked Subway's marketing better with Jared.
I told you we took the wrong staircase
We should have read the tips on navigating the subway.
Wait for the vegan one
It’s a trick. That’s a Po-boy, maybe a Hoagie but definitely not a subway foot long.
If it’s the express, we can eat and be out of here in no time.
Let's take the next one, I really don't care for onions
You go ahead, I'm going to wait for the gravy.
No . . . that’s going Uptown.
Yeah, it looks pretty roomy, but it's mostly lettuce.
Oh fuck
You think we're on a roll?
I think the mayo gets on at 53rd street.
pickles ride free today
Do they have a vegan option?
It's the latest rodent eradication project.
Yeah, I've always hated the way it smells down here.
It's Hoagie Dick!
They've started to call the conductors "transportation artists".
I bet it smells like day-old ham in there.
The Mayor needs to realize more mayo cant fix this post-Sandy.
Gulliver, you idiot!
When you said dinner, I wasn't thinking fast food.
That's not kosher.
When did the subway turn into Subway?
Let's wait for the Wrap.
Okay, Subway in the subway, very funny -- but how am I supposed to get to work?
My doctor says I can only take the BLT once a week.
Let's wait for the next one, it's vegetarian.
Uber Eats is getting a little out of hand
I'm sorry but we need to find another way to get to my mother's for Passover.
Can you believe they're raising the fare to $5?
At least it's running on time.
And you think we have a rodent problem now?
Where I come from we call it a hero.
I never bother showering anymore.
I thought they said 'Big Apple'.
And I thought it was called a subway because it was underground!
Just don't sit in the mayonnaise this time.
The Mayor asked for contributions in-kind
Heroes go to Ground Zero.
That's the express to Coney Island.
Now that's what I call ... Food To Go!!
I thought you ordered a BLT, not a BMT.
It must be the hero's train.
WOW, AMERICA!!!!!
This is the ham and cheese, we need catch the roast beef.
When did the subway become the Subway™?
This is the presidential express.
I thought this was the gluten-free line?
See that grinder, Hoagie? - it’ll take a real hero to wedge that po’boy out of the sub station.
We'll never get home. The salami's running on the local track again.
You've only been vegan for a week. It took me three months to stop seeing it as the 5:06 calzone.
It was caught off New Jersey
We really should have seen this coming after Hershey's bought the roads
They can try anything they want; I'm still calling that a hoagie.
Wait... I don't think that's the 14, it's more like a footlong.
For once, right on time!
I am all for defraying public expenditures, but I knew it was a bad idea when the transit authority announced the had a "natural tie in" with a new sponsor.
Subway's new ad campaign has really taken over the city.
We're going to Philly- let's wait for the next cheesesteak.
They are really testing that no eating on the subway rule.
Hopefully it's a sandwich.
When it breaks down at least I won't get hungry
My favorite!The Italian subway.
This example of modern art is arguably subpar.
I don't mind installation art, just wish it was more imaginative.
Let's wait. Our ticket is vegan.
I'm not getting on any train without mustard.
The pastramis run on time in this country.
Don't get on that one Olive.
The Remembrance of Things Fast
It was better before Uber.
Well, Trump is president.
I see Pizza rat has moved on to sandwiches.
Are you sure a sub is the only way there?
That's the best product placement ever.
Depending on how far you take it, it stops at Satisfied, then Full and finally, Obese.
Not this one. We want the Nathan's, it goes uptown.
I forgot. Do the sesame seeds mean this is a local or an express?
You're right honey, virtual subways are way more fun.
For once, I'd like to not be the meat in the sandwich.
O Hero! My Hero!
No honey, that’s the ham. What we want is the tuna.
Look! It’s the Goodyear Blimpie!
Let's wait for the 5:07: it's vegan.
Let’s wait. The gluten free vegan should be along shortly.
A natural merger from a marketing perspective, but the 40-foot cold cut combo is always overstuffed during the commute.
Let's just get an Uber.
Product placement.
Let's wait for the B train--it usually has extra mayo.
I've heard of the gravy train...
Is this a gluten-free line?
Come on, let's catch the Sandwich Express and eat on the run.
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer!
If we make it, we will not be hungry for dinner
I'm either having a flashback or I'm hungry.
We can't take that one. It's not gluten free.
No accommodation for Passover yet.
the Russians have one you can't even see.
Don’t worry dear, the gluten-free train should be along shortly.
Don’t worry, I ordered two
Oh, that's the noontime special from Little Italy.
I've heard mixed reviews...apparently the food is good, but the seating is terrible.
We don’t need another hero.
Let's take this to the bagel and cream cheese and change at the salad bar.
I thought we'd never find the dining car.
Let's wait for next one, this is traife.
Mmmmm...the BMT.
It must have stopped in Bensonhurst!
Let's wait for the express. The local has too much mayo.
Let's take the Blimpie next time.
Well, the work commute has become a lot more appetizing.
I told you all natural mushrooms were a bad idea
I'm going to wait for the meatball special.
#5! That’s us...
There's plenty of room. Eating capacity is around 40 riders.
I say we take it, before the Fried Turkey Leg gets here.
No, not the 'A', it has onions!
My gluten hallucinations are getting worse.
Say, what's a sub doing in the train station?
Some dining car
Wasn't what I expected a lifetime supply of Subs to look like.
Some companies just take their advertising a little too far..."
They don't make heroes like they used to.
Let’s catch the turkey and provolone at 12:30.
Lettuce wait for the next one, I'm not in a hurry.
I finally get it: Subway
If it's got gherkins in it, I'm getting straight off again.
Look for the "no mayo" car
I'd say this is a bit more than a footlong.
I'll take it to go.
No wonder the rats like it down here.
Wait, Hon. I don't think that's mayo.
ugh...sesame seeds
Either the meds are working, or Subway® has gone too far.
Let's wait for the next one -- it looks crammed.
Well, they did promise better service.
They're selling the naming rights. Have you seen that Roto-Rooter train?
Let’s wait for the pastrami on rye.
I think it's lost.
The subway running on time would be a real hero
Well, if Oscar Meyer could make a weiner mobile why can't Subway take over the E train to Chambers St?
I guess the subway does stop at 14th Street
I think I'm having a "Paleo Diet" side-effect.
We should have taken the gluten-freeway
I guess the subway has finally delivered.
What else did you expect on the subway?
I didn't know you meant "Meat at the Subway"!
Why is the No. 3 with Mortadella running on the No. 1 with Buffalo Mozzarella tracks late nights on a weekday?
Jared spoils everything.
I’ll wait for the 5:30 train. I’m gluten-free.
Wait for the express. It’s gluten-free.
They really sandwich you in there.
Not this one, Harold, we need the veggie no mayo.
Is that the local or the express homonym?
That’s not ours. We have the tuna express.
Why the frown, Nigel? Did you order a tube steak?
The next one should be the local vegetarian
Are you sure this is the train for Little Italy?
Let's wait. The Vegan Express is due in five minutes.
That's the wrong subway.
Gravy train is coming...
Let's wait for the vegan car.
I TOLD you it was a Subway sandwich...
I’m nostalgic for when the New Yorker didn’t misattribute Roz Chast cartoons to Michael Maslin.
Not that one- it doesn’t have pickles.
See, this goes to the Italian neighborhood.
No, we want to get on a chicken salad, not pastrami.
I can take this one if it’s gluten free
Oh darn honey, we missed the taco train
They said there was a problem with the subway — but they may have meant Subway!
Another guaranteed empty seat. They say its because they smell so realistic that they weed out the vegans and picky eaters, naturally reducing traffic to just those who can stomach the ride.
Hey look! It's the new dining car on the Lexington Avenue Line.
I thought they only ran underwater.
That’s not us - the gluten free comes next.
Next one, Pastrami goes downtown.
It's looking at us like we're pieces of meat!
Because of construction, service on all lines have been suspended indefinitely. However, Subway is providing free shuttle service to all their sandwich shops. Thank you for riding the MTA
This is the subway's "5 hour 25 footlong".
Oh, thank goodness, a chew chew!
Coming in hot!
Maybe we're in a Russian nesting doll.
One way to subsidize the subway. $1.50 a bite.
Actually it’s sponsored by Quiznos, but that’s an understandable mistake
This is why I hate riding the subway before dinner.
Too much mayo; let's catch the next one.
Now THAT'S a subway sandwich!
Hold on. Extra cheese means it's a local.
the subway rats ordered it.
Ours is the Meatball Express
Stand clear of the closing doors, cheese.
I think you eat first, and then pay.
Is it possible to get the B L T to Brooklyn without mayo?
Subway delivers
Subway will do anything to get your attention.
Wow! That was some really good stuff.
It's the new service from the METRO - free delivery!
The express sandwich is usually on rye
I'm starving. Where do you want to start?
Attention Passengers! Carbo-Loading on Track 5 . . .
I think the BLT Express Line is next.
On the flip side, it's only $2.75, and definitely longer than a foot.
No Carb Car must be farther down the platform.
Let's wait for the K Train, it's kosher.
I believe the gluten-free service is on the local track.
I'll wait for the Danish.
Stand clear of the lettuce, tomato, and onion.
Next time ask for the six-inch one.
This promo has gotten out of hand.
HERE'S AN IDEA: A SANDWICH SHOP CALLED "SUBWAY:
That Elon Musk is really something isn’t he?
Let's wait for the bagel.
Let's find the gluten free car
They call that one the Moby Dick.
This isn't us. We take the BLT to the Reuben.
This isn’t the Subway I meant.
Really? Shame on you, New Yorker.
#keepPortlandweird
No way! A sub?
That not ours, I asked for rye
This car always has an open bottle of olive oil rolling up and down the aisle.
well its fresher and roomier than this mornings stuffed sausage
Yes, Tim, I know it's a sub. Would you rather take a taxi cabbage?
Can you believe it?... The fare's gone to five dollars a foot!!
No David, Don't be a hero.
Another flatbread to Flatbush!
I think that’s a trademark infringement.
Shall we get a seat in the dining car?
It’s subliminal advertising
Let’s wait for the tuna. It goes down faster.
Must be part of a new SUBWAY ad campaign.
So THAT'S why they call it a Subway station!
It's a long ride, but we won't be hungry.
Remember what happened when you ordered the Kaiser roll in Berlin?
Let's take the express, the local looks a little stale!
Funny, I thought the graffiti would be less appetizing.
No honey. The 9:04 hoagie doesn’t stop at midtown. We’ll have to wait for the hero.
I hate the MTA. You wait for twenty minutes for a local, and all that comes are veggies.
Is this what the President rides on?
I only take vegan rides.
I like the Amtrak sandwiches better.
let's wait for a vegetarian
It’s a subway...... Do you ride it or eat it?
They've added a diner car.
Italian B.L.T. arriving on Track 1. If your destination is Vegan, you must transfer.
I swear the sign had a lowercase “s”.
Even the rats won't eat Subway.
Product placement run amok.
Let’s wait for the 7:05 pastrami.
We should never go shopping when we're hungry !
That is not a 'Footlong.'
Sure it's on time now, but the rats are getting out of hand.
now that's a subway
I always thought it was short for submarine.
The dining car is killer.
Wow! That's some graffiti!
Let’s take the express—the local is too slow, and it’s always stuffed.
We should've caught the footlong.
This is taking product placement too far!
You still gluten free?
Honey, I think we should switch vitamins
Don't worry...The next one has no cheese.
On second thought, let's skip lunch.
Not exactly like the Oscar Mayer Mobile but it will do!
At least it smells good
It's headed to the lower Eats Side.
We must be the millionth customers
I miss the old IRT.
I was expecting a limo, not a sub.
Let's get aboard. I'm hungry.
Since when can you eat on the subway?
Maybe we catch the train at the sandwich shop.
These branding tie-ins have got to stop!
Nuts. We must have just missed the meatballs.
I guess Subway finally released its 200ft long sub...
I've only ever eaten one, but never ridden one.
At least the “sub” part stuck.
Have you realized how commercialized the MTA has become?
The next one has extra cheese. Let's wait.
ahhhhhhh.....NOW I understand why they call it "SUBWAY"!!!
I didn't think the #1 line Lunch Express stopped at 79th St.
These attempts to compete with Uber Eats are getting a bit ridiculous.
Look honey it's the New "Subway" Sandwich!
But I ordered the pizza.
"It asked for the nearest subway station".
Subway is just a figure of speech. It's really just a sandwich that will get you to Brooklyn.
This is taking product placement a bit far, don't you think?
Google maps said the subway was here—but whoa!
Banksy's latest work is very Meta.
You think this is something? You should see the Friday $5 Special!
I see where they were going with this, but isn't it a SUBMARINE sandwich?
It’s the Subway weekly special.
Looks like Pizza Rat really has his work cut out for him this time
Wow, I’ve heard of subway heroes but I never thought I’d literally meet one!
The next one has cheese.
Didn't you buy the gluten-free tickets?
We must be in one of those zany New Yorker cartoons again.
Jared, are you hallucinating again?
'tis neither man nor beast, but it will get you uptown in 20 minutes
Malbec? No, I think a cab would be much better.
Apparently it's a Russian submarine.
Ciabatta be fast today or I am going to be late for work.
I miss the simpler days of Pizza Rat.
They're trying to make the IRT more palatable.
If it's not kosher, we'll have to wait for the next sandwich.
And so our couple discovered the synergy that completed the Second Ave SubwayTM.
Wait, were we to take the literal or figurative train?
Due to construction , service on the B-L-T lines is suspended.
Remember Honey, no eating on the train.
It's on time, so it must be a mirage.
Now we're running late. You should have asked for ketchup.
It's the new Baker line.
You want to take he J, the M, or the BLT?
It runs on bio-fuel...Hellman's.
Oh Hell No! We missed the Subway, what a bunch of Boloney!
It's a 7-grain and full. We'll wait for the 9.
I told you we shouldn't have eaten that salami from the street vendor.
Let's wait for the Coney Island.
It promised an affordable immersive dining experience, but I’m not so sure.
I see something.
It's got to be the B.M.T.
Well, she did say it was a hole in the wall.
It's the local. And so we call it a hero.
Is this what you meant by 'taking a subway at lunch hour'?
Let’s wait for the multi-grain express.
Remember to check your trousers for salami when we get off.
The next one may be less stuffed.
It’s a new line that’s just been added. It’s the Meat Ball Express.
My mistake. I was looking for the 14th St. Jimmy John's!
Wow, Subway has bought out the the underground.
That's more than a foot long.
Let's wait for the Wrap.
This is a superfluous caption for a self-explanatory cartoon.
Let's wait for the daily special. It comes with a beverage.
Well, the restroom smell the same.
Maybe on the third day we'll rise again.
The BLT I ordered only has the B and L. Boston has the T.
Let's go - ain't no five second rule in the Subway.
It's a lot safer since they got rid of Jared.
I told you we should have taken an Uber.
Not this one, Henry, wait for the veggie express.
Let's wait for one that's leaner.
This doesn't make you right about manspreading
This doesn't make you right about manspreading
I believe that this is the wrong subway.
I think we should wait for the next one to see if it's vegetarian.
i think the edibles are kicking in.....
I know what you are going to say. Don't
Let's wait for the pastrami on rye train.
No, not that one. It's an express right to my hips.
Here comes the dining car!
The 16 footer is a better buy.
That's what I call product placement.
That’s why they call it that!
I'm taking the next train. This one's too full and meaty.
Wasn’t it great when our worst problem was graffitti?
Those who forget breakfast are doomed to re-eat it.
Looks like Subway ‘s expanding
That’s coming in from the Jersey burbs.
That's white. Lets wait for the 7 grain at 3pm.
That's what she said.
'I thought this was the L train not the BLT train'
I told you "Subway®" was not what we wanted!
Vol. 2: James as a teen; his girlfriend, Linda; and the Giant Ham & Swiss.
It's the subway lunch special!
Seems like Subway has upgraded its foot-long.
They never should have approved that Subway-subway merger.
I hate being sandwiched in on the subway
I still miss the car car.
Some call it the A Train, however if you believe in reincarnation , just call it the Hoagie Carmichael.
I think we should try a different Subway...this looks like a Hogie
Well, this is a subway.
I guess this train is sponsored by Subway.
It's not what I expected when you said "lets go to the Subway"
We need a hero!
I think I may be taking this diet too seriously.
[No caption required]
Not the hero we deserved.
I felt like I might get something done.
See, I told you. There's actually a Subway on the subway!
Could they be that confused?
I think this is what your mother meant when she told me my diet would come back to haunt me.
We just missed the Reuben. Let's wait for the Lobster Roll.
"How many times do I have to tell you, 'Read the fine print'"!
Wait Matt, we’re on the north meatball.
They say the cravings stop after the first dozen trips.
Let's wait for the drink line.
When you asked for directions, did you say 'Metro' or 'Meta'?
The rats ordered out.
Is this what they call product placement?
The subway system is promoting themes for different neighborhood, this is Little Italy's. Wait until you see Hells Kitchen's.
Wrong line, we want pizza rat.
They had to get creative with the marketing when Jared left.
I see they'v renovated the sub way.
I don't care if you call it the subway, hero or hoagie, it just better be on time.
Tell the Genie I'm getting sick of his literalism.
This is a Whole Wheat, the subway map said Gluten Free.
Let’s take the Subway!
Subway’s newest ad campaign is a little hard to swallow.
Well, this saves us a stop, but now how are we going to get home?
Looks more like it's from Quiznos.
Are we in the right Subway?
Did we mix up the MTA and the B.M.T.?
Looks like we'll need a bigger knife.
I ordered it, like three minutes ago.
Is this a subway station? ...
Meh! New foodie line
Great product placement!
Wow, they really meant submarine!
It seemed like the perfect public-private infrastructure partnership.
Drat! Well, there’s another one coming in 8 minutes, but it may be vegetarian.
We've been dieting too long!
The BLT's out of service, it looks like we're going to have to take this one instead.
Add some fries and Trump will love it.
Wait, that's the local. We want the Subway Express. Ham, cheese and straight to 86th.
Let's wait for the meatball express. It's delicious.
There's something very distasteful about this.
Wait--is this the BLT express or the local?
If we can't finish it we can always take it home.
Looks like "product placement" won the design competition for the new cars.
We should wait for the express, it wont be as stuffed
Let's wait for the next one, this one is stuffed full.
I didn't know 'SUBWAY' delivered.
Michelle Obama would never have let that happen !!
Argh! Wrong subway.
'Ut oh. Wait until Pizza Rat hears about this.'
Product placement is well and good, but where are the doors?
Don't worry, hon. All the subways here are gluten-free.
Looks like the finally finished the renovation
It's symbolic art. One bite and you'll go under ground.
It’s the new subway station.
Banksy was here.
In the good old days, it was only the people being sandwiched.
And what’s more, it’s on time.
It’s not exactly what I had in mind when you said “grab lunch to-go.”
If you eat it all in an hour, it's free.
They call it a subway for a reason.
I hate the sub of the day.
I believe this one goes to the smoked meat district. Let’s ask someone to make sure.
I think we have to take the Subway to get to Jersey Mike's.
She's holding my arm and now this?..Please don't let this be a dream.
Literally!?!
Good heavens Geoffrey, now we’re in a pickle.
I'll wait for the gluten-free express.
It’s packed with carbs!
You'd think that after Jared, Subway would find a better representative – someone you could trust your brand with. Yet this one doesn't have the decency not to have their meat hanging out in public.
Until Cuomo and de Blasio can agree on how to speed things up, I guess we may as well eat the Subway and enjoy the wait.
The eternal consumption engine is what powers it, they say.
I’m so tired of being packed in like sardines...
Food delivery is so great these days.
This MTA/fast food merger isn't working out the way I thought it would.
A new Mayor de Blasio initiative?
This is not exactly what I had in mind when we discussed having lunch at Subway.
Let's wait for the local. It has light mayo.
They're on track with the daily special, but you can't get it to go.
Don't worry dear, you're still my hero.
Looks like Jared’s finally rebranding
Wait! We need the low-cal.
Not quite what I was expecting.
Don't go there, Jared!
It appears there's no doubt we'll be sandwiched in.
I'm not getting in unless it's gluten-free.
Brownies are taking effect, or I'm really famished, cause the 6 Train looks like a subway.
The BLT is still under construction.
I wanted to catch the downtown subway.
I hope this is the gluten-free line.
Wow that new app you have has everything!
And that's how they got their name.
I think it's supposed to be some kind of dad joke.
Lettuce get on the subway. Cheese you later!
I'm going to wait for a Spicy Italian.
It's only five dollars, but how you get it out the door is beyond me.
Let’s wait. The spicy meatball express is due in next.
Wait, no, we need the meatball parm.
That's the local - we want the uptown meatball Express
Sub? No way!
A hero is in our midst.
I said lunch at SUBWAY! Not lunch at THE subway!
Looks greasy. Let's wait for the next one.
I can see it clearly, it's a footlong
Clever product placement.
I guess we might as well have a little something while we wait.
I'm waiting for the roast beef
Is this some kind of dumb Subway sandwich joke?
Untitled.
The quintessential product placement.
Hallucination dear, let’s wait for the A Train!
That’s only a 6-inch. Let’s wait for the next one
Graffeaty.
It's the old BMLT line.
I'd rather wait for the Italian Supreme with Sharp Provolone - it's an Express train.
In the subway, I like my subs like I like my men, 12 inches and Italian.
This could be our gravy train.
Do you think there's a low carb line?
Agreed. Privatizing the infrastructure does seem to have some drawbacks.
I heard that in Boston they call that a "T."
Don't get on. This ride costs $5 a foot.
I don't believe it! That's Carmichael's Hoagy!
Let's wait for the Twinkie train to Zinger Town.
Lets wait for the sourdough express.
No dear, this one has meat. We’ll catch the Veggie Delite®.
WOW—-Biggest subway—ever.
Look what just rolled into the station.
Of course, that's why they call it a subway!
The ONE TIME it’s on schedule I forget sriracha.
That’s a local. Let’s wait for the Nathan’s.
Naw, that's a hoagie. We're waiting for the sub.
Let's take this one. Smells like they held the mayo!
Somebody's idea of a joke.
Let’s wait, I can’t take another onion car.
Boy, this brings a whole new meaning to "Taking the Subway"!
Let's grab a bite to eat on the way.
Honey, did you bring the dijon?
That must be the BLT from Jersey Mike.
That’s not ours. We’re waiting on the Ham & Swiss uptown.
I'll wait for the next one. This one isn't whole wheat.
I said we need more heroes on the subway, it this is ridiculous!
Bun silent, bun deep.
Yes, they merged.
I don’t know whether to be disappointed or impressed.
I don't care if it's not moving... it's still going to be faster than the R train.
THAT'S how they get the flavour!
Wow - this is the definition of SuperSizing.
Everyone needs a hero they can look up to.
I don’t know about you, but I think this is subliminal advertising
Now that's advertising!
Forget it. They're packed in there like sardines.
Let's wait for the salami and provolone line.
So that's why they increased the fare to five dollars.
and here we have the sight of the original "Subway Sandwich.
They raised the fare to $5 for this?
I hate to think how much the added avocado costs.
It's the newest addition to the subway. Instead of you stopping for lunch, it stops for you.
You know, the double-decker upstairs comes with a free side.
In London it’s called the Tube.
This reminds me of a dream I had last night.
you wanna just split one ?
Did we miss the BLT?
Let's wait for the next one. There's no way this one is gluten free.
I thought Meals on Wheels delivered to homes. But, I have to agree. This provides a great platform for people to interact.
This is a Brooklyn Bridge bound 6-inch train. The next stop is...
Is this the first time you have ridden the grinder?
Karl, wait for the next one... you know I'm gluten intolerant!
Ugh! Signals must not be working again! I asked for no pepperoni.
First Pepsi, now Subway. These marketing teams really need to learn how to read the room.
This sub upgrade must have cost a lot of dough.
Pardon me, is this the the BLT North or South?
First we take the pepperoni, then the salami express to pastrami central.
No, I’m sure that’s not our subway!
I prefer the subway rye’d
Too loaded; let's take the slider instead.
Thanks for coming with me darling, after the accident I couldn't bare the thought of going provolone.
Next train. That one has onions.
Quick service, but didn’t we order the A train?
I told you that on this line the MTA really sandwiches them in....
I can’t belive it’s not challah.
The Reuben won't be coming. The juice gunked up the third rail.
I like the new cars.
Actually, I think it's a gyro.
I thought you said the Carnegie Deli closed.
Lucky, I brought my hand sanitizer
We want the gyro to downtown.
And they wonder why there’s rats down here.
Subway has never been the same since Jared went to jail.
I wonder if it's a local or an express.
No matter what he says on Twitter to the contrary, you can't deny that it's just a giant, useless, subway sandwich, right?
Things are finally starting to make sense.
When did the IRT become the BLT?
Looks like we’ll be sandwiched on the train again.
No honey, we need to catch the meatball sandwich to get to the zoo.
Stay close to the lettuce, avoid the mustard.
No, dear, we're waiting for the whole wheat!
‘ I’m so hungry I think I’m hallucinating!
Should we take this one or wait for the roast beef ?
It’s one of those ‘chicken or egg’ things. And I just don’t know the answer.
The combo ticket comes with a newspaper and a handi-wipe for $1 more
I thought our ticket said 11:00 with no tomatoes...
Well this give the 5 dollar foot-long a run for its money
Everybody's hero!
That's a lot more than a footlong and I only paid $2.75.
Yes it's a Subway - the other platform goes to Jersey, Mike.
I tell you, all of this supersizing has simply gotten out of control.
You were expecting a Big Mac down here?
Oh, I get it, literally.
We’ll be uptown in 12 minutes if we can sandwich our way in.
The cold cuts right through here
I think I'll just take the salad.
Don’t they know that around here we call them heroes?
Let's catch the next one. This one is too filling.
To get on,I guess we have to eat our way in.
I wonder what the jumbo size looks like.
0k. We can take the canned tuna to Fulton, then change to the packed sardines.
I can swear I ordered an 8-inch.
I finally get it !
Subway?
I simply never know what's coming on the weekend.
Yeah, the city really should screen out candidates with a weakness for puns.
Let's skip this one it's just way too cheesy.
Is it 'a Subway in the subway' or 'a subway with a Subway'?
Pizza Rat has his job cut out for him.
The 'F' actually stands for Footlong.
I thought we would be packed in like sardines.
I'm getting that Salvador Dalí kind of feeling.
The Augment Reality fad is really getting out of hand.
'Very impressive advertising campaign !'
It looks full, honey. Can we wait for the milk run?
Wow! Another untrainable super hero.
Geez, Cynthia Nixon works fast.
Remember to sit in the middle. It’s the Twelve Inch.
It's part of the new Subway "alt-truth in advertising" campaign.
I like this Subway location the best.
I hope it stops at Coney Island; suddenly I'm craving a hot dog!
Well, it definitely passes the smell test.
I don't like this new Subway commercial.
Say what you like, but I just love the way the subway smells.
I understand Subway is suing.
Do you think it's kosher?
Looks like the subway is full.
Well, at least we’ll have something to eat during the rush-hour delay.
Can we wait for the gluten-free line?
Subway is finally taking their marketing to the next level
This new diet is making me crazy.
You sure this goes to Sesame Street?
It's a public-private partnership.
Let's wait for the gluten-free uptown.
In Philadelphia they call it a hoagy.
Wait!! I think I see Myrtle Feinbaum!
This one has Yonkers written all over it.
I'm pretty sure it stops in Little Italy.
It looks like the 2 o'clock ham and cheese is running a little late today.
Looks like (sigh...) the Donald is back in town!
Is this - The Subway or - A Subway?
Yet another "to go" order.
I know I said to order me the "super-sized" sub, but.............
Obviously, an advertising ploy.
They forgot the pickles again.
Yes but condiments are only on 13!
Subway must be really desperate.
Now, don't you think portion control is an issue?
We’re always getting sandwiched in during rush hour
Hoagie? You're missing the point entirely here, Hon.
Let's wait for salami and cheese. We've got plenty of time.
Fuck das a big fuckin sandwech wtf lol............
I always wondered why they called it Subway!
Subway says "Make it what you want." Well, I want it to get me to Grand Central Station on time.
No pickles...wait for the next one!
Subway is overdoing it.
It's the Hunger Express.
Super size has taken on a whole new meaning....
I had heard they are starting to samwich people in.
Wait! You don't have to be a Hero
Let's ask if there's an extra charge for delivery.
I hope it's fast food.
So that's why the A's late.
I wonder if they all washed their hands?
No, Honey, I don’t think we missed the Pastrami.
Now how’d that get sandwiched in there?
I liked it better when subway meant train not sandwich.
We should've gotten flatbread.
You never listen! I said, No tomatoes!
Is this the subway that goes to 41st and Rye?
Oh, this must be the new six-car Mayoliner!
Let's wait for the six-inch vegetarian.
The City Engineer is a literalist.
Since when does the subway “meat olive our eggspectation?”
Darn! I ordered it on a poppyseed roll.
The express leaves out onions.
Let's take the next one Dear, this has too many onions."
It only stops when I miss lunch, but let's take the next train.
I guess that's why they call it the subway.
In Philadelphia they call it the hoagie.
Let's wait for the gluten-free express.
Where's the gluten free train?
What a bunch of baloney! That’s supposed to be a subway car?
Let this one pass - It’s the Cholesterol Express.
You said the train to Bologna, right?
We'll wait for the "no onion" train.
We’ll board toward Autological, change at Heterological and arrive at Rhetoric
Yeah, Subway finally bought out the MTA. It's a horizontal merger.
They call it the "Elon Musk burger."
Ooh Honey, do we have time to wait for the chicken parm?
I hope we can get a seat by the salami.
There's a Subway everywhere now.
I told you to order the footlong, not the 30 fot long.
Is it going uptown or downtown?
Isn't this product placement a bit "over the top"?
In Russia. You eat submarine sandwich. In America. Sandwich eats you
I think we where supposed to take the hot pastrami on rye, not the turkey on toasted wheat.
We can't dismiss any creative new idea.
I can't believe it! I know, unbelievable! I said no poppy seeds.
That's a grinder. We have to catch a hoagie to go uptown.
That sandwuch smells like urine.
I don't think we're in the 'Big Apple' anymore.
wha- why are we in black n' white but sandwich color???
Living With a Ghostbuster: "Ray...you gotta stop doing this."
Pizza Rat's gonna love this!
I wish they ran more gluten-frees on the weekend.
I feel like this already has a caption. Am I wrong?
Forget about holding the doors, just hold the cheese!
That is so dangerous! Now don't you try to be a hero too.
Darn, it’s a hero. The subs must come in downstairs.
Product placement.
No pickles. I'm not going in.
This must be the original location.
I told you, we can only visit my parents via kosher.
Subway's new guerrilla marketing campaign
I told that you we shouldn't have eaten first.
Maybe if we wait for the lox and bagel, it will be less full.
Let’s wait for the one with the Gorgonzola.
Let’s wait for the tuna.
It's the new BLT line sponsored by Subway.
This must be the sub-way.
This isn't a good start to our slow food evening.
I don't care if it is running on time, it's not vegan.
Well, this certainly redefines subway.
It's the Bologna Express, dear
Wait. Did that man say to TAKE the Number Two or to EAT the Number Two?
That's the Italian. We're want to take the Reuben.
I never said that I wanted it toasted.
Did you hear that for some reason they changes the BMT to the BLT!
Too many carbs. Maybe we can catch the Lettuce Wrap uptown instead.
Find out if they have provolone.
When did they put a dining car on the E train?
Well I hope it's gluten free. Otherwise I'm going to be late again.
It's not glamorous, but it beats being in a pickle.
When I bought my franchise, they claimed they were the biggest in the world.
Wait, that's not the local pastrami and rye.
This was not what I expected when they said they were building an underground subway.
I guess we can get to Rye after all.
Apparently, they're replacing cars with carbs.
I don't get it, why is there a hoagie down here
Let's wait for one without mayonnaise.
I know you may think this is bad, but on the positive side it doesn’t smell like pee in here!
It actually smells less of onions than usual.
"Hold the mayo, and mind the gap".
Well here in Philadelphia, we call it the hoagieway.
Advertising genius!
My first time in the New York Subway. I had no idea it would be this delicious!
So, do you still stand by your opinion that the new head of the transit authority knows what he's doing?
Lets wait for the hold the onions car.
There's an unpleasant aftertaste, but at least it's fast.
Back in Philly we call it the Hoagieway.
it was 5 dollars for a foot long ticket
It's the new 'subway' express
What's a hoagie doing in a subway?
Let’s hope this SUBWAY has a better on time performance
True, but only when considered subjectively.
Well, there goes supper.
Let's wait for the Veggie Delite.
I thought we ordered delivery , not pickup
Not this one, it's a franchise.
This one is express; we should wait for the Meatball Marinara.
No one’s questioning the value honey, it’s the hygiene that might be subpar
Let's wait for the next one. You know how I am with gluten.
This is why I prefer the no-growth-hormone ham sandwiches
I still say it's a Hoagie.
Nope. Too literal.
No wait, it's just a gyro
Either we missed McDonald's or its the next one - I can't remember.
I love the new, fresh upholstery, but I can't stand that smell.
Can you tell if this is the gluten-free line?
In this case, eating on the train is not only permitted, but encouraged!
another AI snafu. I only ordered a footlong.
And just like that, the subway hero was on the tracks.
Oh good, today it’s the ham and provolone
It's part of an ad campaign for a new Subway on 14th Street!
I'd like to see the drink it comes with!
Darn! No window seats...
Don't be a hero.
Don’t you hate it when grinders ride the subways?
Do cookies come with that?
So this is where the name came from.
Yes, I'd like your #14 delivered to my son's football game at 3 pm sharp.
there it is Walter..... Pelosi's prototype for The Wall.
Let's wait for one on wheat.
Food for thought.
When did the IRT become the BLT?
We just missed lunch
Don't touch it. No need to be a hero.
Oh no, too many carbs! Let's take the next one.
You’re right honey, transit’s really crumby these days
Hold up, Phil. Do you mind if we wait for the veggie sub?
Remember when these used to seat 12?
But it's only a Footlong. Do you think it can hold both of us?
Let’s wait for a toasted one
Let’s just wait for the soup trolley.
It looks like the marketing team at Subway is really pulling out all the stops.
Not yet! We’re waiting for the roast beef.
This isn't us, our line is toasted.
Let's wait for one with no onions.
Alright right have it your way. We'll wait for the Whopper Special.
We better wait for the next one
Sub-optimal
I told you this route was too obvious.
No No, thats not the right one. We have to wait for the Cheese Steak; thats the one going to Philly.
This branding thing is out of control.
I told you we were on the wrong side of the tracks!!
The mayo and pickle car is late as usual.
I expected it to be about a foot long.
Now we are really going to be sandwiched between everyone
We're not in Kansas, anymore.
There goes the subway gyro...
I've always wanted to ride the deli express!
At least the brakes work.
It's on loan from Subway.
At $5 a foot that’s gonna be expensive.
I know you said Jared was getting into transportation, but this?
It was time to consider the possibility that Netflix was out of ideas.
I love the new wrap advertising they've done, it's genius.
Should we ride in the dining car?
Let's wait for the next one, this one has onions.
I'll take the number 6 on a hero.
At least it's not crowded!
I see the MTA lost the trademark appeal.
It doesn't look like a Kosher sub, let's wait for the next one.
Mind the mayo
I think we should probably stay away from Hell's Kitchen for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Musk sure has revolutionized public transportation.
Let's wait for the next Italian Herb and Cheese.
Let's wait for the meatball.
Sorry, dear, that's not train; we're waiting for the pastrami on rye.
YIKES! Those folks are really sandwiched in there. Let's wait for the next train!
That's where their name came from as you could surmise.
Having stayed up too late the night before, the editor posts the wrong cartoon.
You're still MY hero.
Let's wait for the gluten-free car.
As if it wasn't bad enough, they've privatized it.
Wait! This doesn't look kosher.
The sandwich is actually called a submarine, not a subway. Whatever, as long as it's going uptown.
This must be the renovation that I read about
Honey, lets wait for the wrap.
Cool! Must be a new branch of Le Train Bleu.
It seems logical to me.
I get the branding and all, but that thing looks way vegan-unfriendly and totally loaded with gluten. I'm waiting for the next car.
Wait for the next one. I hate peppers.
Eat it all and get subs for life free
I'm waiting for one with no Mayo.
This is the price we have to pay when a private sandwich company takes over public transit.
Just a dream? Well, that would explain the Freudian symbol.
I thought you said we were taking the subway, not going to Subway.
I like to eat, right on schedule!
Maybe we should take a cab. We just had lunch.
So that’s why it’s called the Subway.
I think it's lost.
When "The New Yorker" screws up the caption contest
No, wait--that's the express train; it's non-stop from your mouth to your hips.
No, this is the BLT; the 1, 2 and 3 are upstairs.
I don't trust it. Let's wait for the "A" train.
I think it's mustard.
Selling this sponsorship is cheesy.
Let's wait for the Philly cheese-steak.
Wow. They really DO deliver their jumbo sandwiches anywhere.
It's a symbolic work of art in homage to Trump's ego.
I'll just wait for the veggie sub.
I forget. Is there mayo on the local?
No Frank. Not this Subway.
That's the #6 special."
The conductor said "lettuce enter". I thought it was a bunch of baloney.
Sandwich named for transit system, or transit system named for sandwich?
No way Quiznos will top that.
Yeah? Then why isn't anyone else eating?
Just as crowded, but twice as delicious!
Wait for the next one. The Oldenburg’s always stuffed.
Wow...... That's what I call in your face advertising!
My demons haunt me everywhere.
Wait, wrong subway.
Your order or mine?
Mark, you owe me a dollar.
It was just a matter of time.
Didn't it look longer in the photos?
Run home get the coupon..otherwise it'll be an additional 1800 dollars.
It has pepperoni, let's wait for the next one.
Is this the one that goes to Flavortown?
Now THAT's a Subway promotion!
We should have taken the Upper BLT.
I wish they'd focus more on improving the service than the interactive marketing.
Oh my God. Its a giant sub.
I’m sure this is the train to little Italy
I used to think a $5.00 foot long was a deal.
Maybe he's trying to go upstream to spawn.
Hold on...that one looks a little seedy...
It's just as good as the A train, except with mayonnaise.
The subway sandwich shops seem to be expanding.
These S train wraps are getting out of control.
I think it's the quarter-tonner.
I finally understand late capitalism.
This is our station - Subway subway.
Where 'affinity marketing' and 'product placement marketing' join the A Train.
I see the Blocklong Spicy Italian is back.
Let's try to get in.
Oh, honey. Let's wait for the next one, those tomatoes are not organic.
Honey, is the Subway on time today?
Is this that new Subway they were talking about?
Let's skip the Subway Club and take a Veggie Delite to Midtown - coming up next.
John, wait... This subway is not vegan!
Talk about taking advertising to the lowest level.
Should have went with the gravy train.
Let's wait for the next one...salami doesn't agree with me.
There "is" no punchline, Irving—Don't even try.
This must be the new BLT line to the Deli District.
Well, if they can't get them to run on time . . . .
They're holding it for the mayo.
Honey, I think we're supposed to take the Tuna Melt downtown.
I’m not riding until it’s gluten free.
I’ll tolerate Subway's guerrilla marketing to avoid the fare hike.
This is too stupid for words !!
We’re going to need some napkins.
It's not a real sub. It's guerilla advertising.
We better take this one - the next one may be a while
Let's get on - it's not nearly as full as the meatball sub.
It's against the wall, so it must be local.
Our gravy train has just arrived
That's the Cold Cut Combo ... we need the Meatball Marinara ...
They haven’t cleaned the 6 in months
I told you it was headed straight to my thighs.
What? That's supposed to be the 3:05 expresso.
Don't worry. The next one will have pastrami.
Carbon. Carbohydrates. There's always a price to pay.
On my commute home I feel like a piece of meat. And by the time I get home I feel like a vegetable.
Does this connect with chips ?
We need an all stop. The Italian beef will be along in five minutes.
"Well, this must be the Grand Subway"!
My train is the breakfast croissant.
It's another one of those promotions, "Make a Sandwich Great Again."
And this is just the dining car: wait 'til you see the rest!
Now we know. Lunch meat comes from The Bronx.
The sandwich generation indeed.
No, that's my hero!
I'll bet that's a Subway promotion.
Let's wait for the next one, honey. Maybe it'll be gluten-free.
This one must go to Brooklyn
The design specification was supplied by Alexa.
But how do we know if it's kosher?
Wait until Pizza Rat gets aload of that.
Uh-oh. I think the mushrooms are starting to kick in.
I just hope they held the mayo this time.
I said I wanted to go up town for a sub. This is not what I had in mind.
Wait! It's the Trump Tower Express.
You had to order the whole size.
That’s NOT our train, that’s the New York-Presbyterian, Mount Sinai and NYU Langone Medical Center Cardiac Express.
What???!!!!! This was supposed to be a veggie subway !
Maybe he heard me say 50 footer...
Maybe we can grab a seed.
Definitely an improvement.
Looks like we’re subbing in!
Amazon deliveries are amazing.
I wonder if it's gluten free
All the millenials prefer avocado toast.
What's next, buying iPhones out of three story apples?!
Don't complain. Morning commuters have to climb aboard a sesame seed bagel with cream cheese.
Hot Damn!
Try to find the “No Onions” car.
Let's take the meatball.
No, not this one Harold, we want the Hot Dog Coney Island Express.
Let's wait for one that we both like.
Should I say something?
Let's wait for the next train. This one is stuffed to the max.
Sorry, I don't take whole wheat.
I prefer the next one with the beer and chips
Subway, sub-sandwich; as long as we get there who cares?
lets wait for the multi-grain uptown
I love how roomy it's gotten since they introduced the gluten-free train.
Too much cholesterol, let’s walk.
I thought this line was gluten-free
Shouldn’t we wait for Reuben?
Let's wait -the next one holds the mayo.
I could smell this car from a mile away. Let's wait for another.
I told you Derrick, no pickles! Do you even listen to me?!
At least our taxes are going towards good pastrami.
I’m amazed that they deliver
That one will take you straight to Glutenville.
Mass transit is in a pickle.
I thought they were called subs because they look like submarines, not subways.
IRT, BMT...BLT?
I never did understand why they call it a "subway."
Finally, a subway that’s 600 feet long.
It’s the subway’s new dining car!
He started out vegan and went rogue...
Doggone it, Miles! I told you we had too much time with those virtual reality glasses!
Only one stop to Indigestion.
The advertising is getting ridiculous.
No wonder it smells like salami down here.
hope they didn't forget the chips and drink
Ok, we are on the "Literal Line"
The graffiti artist has an ironic sense of humor.
What did you think it would be? A slice of pizza?
This stupid country....
Darn! We've missed it. But I think there's a Taco Bell in five minutes or so.
Underground advertising seems to have reached a new low.
No, it's not local. That prosciutto is definitely from overseas.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing significant delays at the 14th Street Station due to an ongoing po' boy investigation.
Do you think it's kosher?
We can eat on the subway.
Wait for the next train; this one has no mayo.
Look hun, a Subway in the subway.
No dear, we want the 3:45 Pizza Express.
We misread the map. This looks like the Subway Stop.
Isn't that supposed to come with chips?
So that’s why they call it a “subway”!
Fast food, with delays.
I’m afraid that if I take the Subway I may be left in a pickle.
Honey wait! It has onions.
The pastrami should be here in twenty minutes.
Any more deferred maintenance and this subway will fall apart. Then we’re toast.
I love the bronze statues over in the 9th Avenue station, but this is delicious.
Five dollars well spent.
Since when did they switch to submarines?
Next you know the fare will be $4.99
It's true. Jimmy John's is really freaky fast.
They call this one The Whale, and it comes with a large soda.
Let’s wait for one without onions.
What no pickle?
You said the Number Seven had mayo.
Is Freaky Fast supposed to be this freaky?
I’m waiting for the next one. I prefer no mayo!
Subway is going crazy with their marketing!
Can I sit by the window this time Fred?
I thought I told you that I only like their flatbreads.
That’s taking product placement a bit too far
Honey, I thought they sold footlongs; not milelongs?!
Do you think it's still 6 grams of fat or less?
Not this one, it's full of pickles.
„Oh no, we‘ve missed the vegan line!“
I must be a lot hungrier than I thought.
I hate cross-marketing.
I'm not taking it unless it's vegan.
I guess it makes sense. We’re usually sandwiched together anyway.
They say the new trains have some secret sauce.
Remind me why they call it a hoagie.
Ohhh, is this why our tickets were just five dollars?
Ready to be "sandwiched in" again?
Is this the local gluten free?
The Vegan Shuttle is usually less crowded.
How do you get that thing home?...let alone eat it
Should we wait for the next one or be sandwiched in here?
Subway? I had no idea!
Nerdy hipster couch potatoes.
I'm going to stop calling them hoagies.
It’s about time that they subsidized the trains.
Makes you hungry and sort of sick at the same time!
Should we take it or wait for the vegetarian?
If you want vegetarian, you have to take the #2 line.
And all this time I thought the sandwich was named second.
Well it is a sub way
That's not ours. We're looking for the meatball sub.
I was hoping that seeing color for the first time would be a little more meaningful
You take it; I’ll wait for the salad special.
Let's hail a Quizno instead.
The de Blasio and Cuomo Compromise
Twenty minutes late, as usual!
That's the pastrami. We want the ham.
What a bargain! Our $5 meteocard was only meant to get us a foot-long.
I didn't realize how bad the fast food epidemic had gotten.
Let's take it literally.
As long as Jared isn't the conductor.
Do you think this train has a sandwich car?
What kind of meta-commentary is this?
This settles it - you are the most literal person I’ve ever dated!
See, I told you we weren't at the wrong Subway
Let's try to get a seat in the center, it's the best part.
This is what we get for electing a mayor who only had fast food experience.
No, it's not a whale! It's what your son eats for breakfast!
Clever 'Subway' advertising wrap, George? Or our 52 'feetlong' lunch?
Oh good. We made the lunch hour.
so this is the subway the Americans love...
A little literal, no?
Don't even think of calling it a Hoagie.
Remember, don't make eye contact on the Subway!
I think it's the BLT running on the IRT.
Subway has really gone crazy with it advertising
It's about time they converted the trains to hybrid.
I submit it's a substantial yet subtly subliminal subterranean advertisement for a savory submarine sandwich.
Now there's a submarine sandwich we'd need a harpoon to land.
Looks like the new Second Avenue subway is mostly bread. Typical.
Let's wait for the 10:15; I prefer kosher.
Let's wait for the turkey.
Please don't tell me you're getting on the Gluten Free train !!
Of course all the A-Trains are called Hoagies.
Maybe we should wait for the next one, this subway looks quite full.
Let's wait for the next train. It's a meatball.
Let's not get on. We'd feel all sandwiched in.
Subway's thrown a bundle into this ad campaign!
So that is why the subway has started to crumble recently
This one has salami. I won't get on it.
Uptown is mustard. Downtown is mayo!
That's the Express--it has extra ketchup.
footlong sub of the day is always faster than the L train
At least it's more dependable than the hoagies in Philly.
If this were London, we'd be seeing toothpaste.
When’s the last time this thing was oiled..?
Lettuce wait for the next train.
But is it gluten free?
As if it needs three parking spots.
I think someone checked the wrong "subway" box.
Let’s wait for the tuna.
Must be torture for the rats.
Isn't that the Hoagie from Brooklyn ?
Wait! This one has olives. We need to catch the one with extra pickles.
No,that’s not ours. We need to wait for the turkey.
Is this the BLT Express from Subway?
I think we should wait for the tuna salad on wheat
Great, not only have we missed the train but now I am hungry!
It is what it is.
Well, you know, subways have to stay competitive these days!
I thought this was the gluten-free line?
That's today's express special.
I told you, it's the Express that's always tuna.
Lettuce sit together
This is the new subway?
It's from Texas.
Looks like they've expanded the menu on Metro-North again.
Try to sneak that thing into a movie.
They say it is the world's longest.
Should we go for the Italian this time?
I guess it’s better than having your knee replaced with a burger joint!
The sub stops here!
Well, it's better than taking a hoagie.
Looks like the express from Hell's Kitchen to me.
Let’s make our way to dinner, before we chance missing it and have to wait for the next meal.
Don't worry, it's gluten free.
Finally, a vegetarian option!
Hmm, I think the acid is kicking in.
Dammit this is the wrong "Subway"
Aw, rats! Sandwiched again.
I specificially said No Pickles!
No wait. The next one should be the Veggie.
Next time, let's eat before we head out.
We should've just taken a cob.
No, it’s a hoagie.
Let's wait for the meatball sub.
Dear Lord, we've stumbled into one of Bil Keane's stupid puns.
This must be 'Puns In Transportation Day'.
Huh, very meta.
No, that's the express.
That’s the Foot Long Car. It’s smaller than they claim.
Are they bigger or is it my imagination?
That's not ours. We're waiting for the extra mayo.
Darn it! I was hoping for the 5 O' Clock taco.
Is this the Subway to 125th St.?
The BMT just isn't what it used to be.
It's the last sub you'll ever need
Wow. Subway will go to any length to try to make us forget Jared.
we better take it....it's the last hero
Yes that's the local. But is it gluten-free?
I always thought it would take a hero to fix this.
subway.....sandwich" "get it?
This Subway ad campaign has gone too far
I hope they held the mayo this time!
Don't you go down there and be a hero!
The veggies are local.
Let's wait for the cappacuolo express.
The BLT is running local.
Not this one. Wait for the French Dip.
This new 2nd street subway is so New York!
I guess it's just too big for UPS.
"I was wondering when they would do this".
Stand clear of the closing doors, cheese.
Is that the whole enchilada?
Wait,that's not our subway. We're waiting for the meatball to little Italy.
How many entries do you think will mention subway this week?
They just don't make 'em like they used to.
Haven't your heard? Subway acquired the MTA!
It was the only way they could New Jersey buy-in.
Wow -- Pizza Rat has out done himself!
In Philly we call it the hoagieway.
We are waiting for the double decker, this is not our train honey
Guess I'm not the only one who feels like a piece of meat on the subway.
This is a local. The grilled chicken express is six minutes out.
Credibly fresh if they could only stay on schedule.
'That can't be fresh'
Let's wait for the next one. I don't like mayo.
Advertising really is taking over the subways.
Wait! The prime rib car is next!
I thought this was the train to Chinatown.
Should we eat it or ride it?
Pizza Rat sure is getting ambitious!
Yes, I suppose Blimpie would offer a more scenic trip.
Not this one. Let's wait for a gluten-free one.
Baloney.
Let's wait for the next one. I'm allergic to tomatoes.
Don't bite into it, there is probably a train under the food.
Look a Hoagie from Philly got into the New York SUB- way system.
Looks like someone took their franchise agreement literally.
At least if it was a bagel we could get it rolling.
Let's wait for the Black Forest Ham express.
Yup, infrastructure maintenance here is a bunch of baloney.
$5-footlong to Fulton Street.
I can't imagine how gross it would be in there during the summer.
Drat!! I was hoping for the 1:00pm turkey express.
I told you there's no Vegan stops this weekend.
Don't look so surprised---- we've been tracking subs for decades.
Wait till you see the bag of chips.
So that’s why it’s called the Subway.
Let’s wait, that one has cilantro.
In Pennsylvania, it's called the Hoagieway
Since when do they ever reroute the Italian BMT to 14th Street?
It beached itself looking for fries.
Oh Honey, not to worry, you'll always be my hero!
UH OH, LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA SANDWICH US IN.....
I'm going to wait for the express ...
At least the rats didn't eat this one
Oh Damn!, I forgot the napkins!
That's what you get for hiring British transport consultants
Looks like that subway modernization is no baloney.
Problem is you've got to go to platform 5 via travelator 3 to get a napkin.
Are we trainspotting or watching carbs?
I’m not going to lay on a bed of lettuce just to go to Philly
You SAID let's go to Subway!
Let's wait for the vegan car.
I’ll start here. You start at 23 rd street and we’ll meet at 18th.
What, no anchovies?
It's the 6:06 express from Philadelphia.
If it’s not a subway sandwich, then what is it?
Let's wait for the Italian B.M.T.
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
À la recherche du temps perdu.
Let's wait for the next train. The schedule says it's gluten free.
You have to pre-order 7 days in advance to ride that one.
Is this toasted or express?
There should be at least one car with vegan friendly branding.
The subway's just not cutting the mustard.
Let's wait for the next one, pastrami always gives me indigestion.
These promotional connections have finally gone over the edge.
Just another day in the Teacher’s Lounge
Subway sandwich or subway train? I'm still working on the chicken or the egg.
Look hun, it's the old B.M.T. line.
I'm not getting on that piece of white bread
And if you're in a pickle, you can always take the Sub
It's Subways latest promotion: "Eat your way to a seat.
That's not the uptown.
This is the place, Jimmy! Just make a run at it, and you'll soon be on your way to Luigi's Magical Delicatessen School for Subways, Grinders, and Po'boy Sandwiches!
The Broadway line offers free lunch on Wednesdays but you don't get your choice of condiments.
It's an interesting concept but a really dumb cartoon.
Too bad it's not freaky fast.
Bet we can eat it all before the next stop?
First time in a Subway?
This is Pittsburgh, that's called a hoagie...
Oh, this is the wrong line. We want Tuna.
The 'BLT' train is right on time.
I call it gluten for gluttons.
It looks too full. Let's wait for the next subway!
Even the subways are gluten free now.
It must be the express to Yankee Stadium
Well, I guess the poor boy has gotten filthy rich!
The meatball marinara moves so slowly through the system.
It always smells like vinegar down here.
Who's idea was it to give Marcel Duchamp an artist-in-residence job on the Subway?
Let’s wait for the next one without onions.
Let’s just get on...we can always change when we get to 14th Street...
You certainly can tell which of the new cars were built in Bologna, Italy.
Sheesh. Talk about over-the-top product placement.
Honey this pastrami sub car is on a local train. We can take it to the next station and wait for a Hamburger Express to Rockaway Avenue. The left overs I'll put on this doggy bag!
Let’s wait for the next one....I prefer flatbread.
I think it’s the Italian B.M.T.
Wait. We don't want this one, it's got mayo.
The rats are gonna have a field day with one.
Let’s wait for the bar car.
I hear it has its own zip code.
"The 'Veggie Delight' car is usually less crowded!'
In turn, they're calling their sandwich the Broadway Express.
Public transport is cheap, but I hate getting sandwiched in with all those strangers!
Wait for the croissant express.
And I thought they were getting pushy with their last ad campaign.
The "Mmmmm" train
At least the BLT is on time.
I've heard of food trucks....
C'mon. Let's eat local.
Oh c'mon Harry, it has to be a nicer ride than what we've been getting lately.
I bought it after the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Isn't it just gorgeous?
It runs express to Columbus Circle. You can switch to the Veggie there.
Apparently I'm hungry.
I'm glad I didn't order the Molten Lava Cake.
this gives a whole new meaning to "stop to grab lunch"
"Rob, we're vegan. We've got to wait for the next subway." - Margaret
He said it's the Spicy Italian to Bay Ridge and to watch the mayo.
It's called the 'Quarter Ton-er'
Don’t be picky.
Are you going to eat your pickles?
It's bigger on the inside.
It connects with the Cold Cut Combo uptown...
I thought this was the Subway to the Bronx?
What kind of mushrooms did I eat at lunch?
We've definitely hit the substation.
It looked like more meat in the picture.
Looks like the mayor and governor finally reached an agreement.
The doors open on the other side.
NOT the subway I was expecting.
Now that's what I call "subway art."
Hey, you got your wish for a sub "my way"...
Next stop: South Philly.
Hun, is it one of those Banksy’s?
I think they're overcompensating.
Late again.
It's a big year for Superheros
They’re calling it a “subway sandwich.”
'Back home we called it a Hero.'
Do you think it comes with a salad?
All the pepperonis are taken.
Not what the Subway I was expecting.
It's to discourage tagging.
Wow, the subway sandwich artist really outdid themselves this time.
It's Subway's Greenwich Villich Sandwich
Clever Subway advertising gimmick!
Let's wait for the Italian Meatball.
Too sandwiched in ! Let's wait for the next one.
Now I understand why the fares have been lowered to $5.00.
I’m holding out for a hero. He’s gotta be larger than life.
If it's all the same to you, I'll wait for the oil train. This one's mayo.
Stand by, you should see the 5:15 p bag of chips.
I thought you said the uptown was gluten free?
Now instead of being sardines, we'll be salami.
The hyperloop sure looks different from how I imagined it.
Looks like the subway has changed its roll
Captain Obvious said this was the one...
This is what we get for $2.75 one way? Still doesn't cut the mustard for me.
Oh, shoot, I was hoping for extra cheese.
Another Corporate Takeover
Where’s pizza rat when you need him?
No! After nearly drowning in the car pool, I'm not taking this thing to The Battery!
One MTA BLT, coming right up!
pastrami stress disorder
I didn’t know they had electrified them.
I want to get some cookies at the end of the line.
I ride gluten-free. We'll walk!
Look! The fast food chain has added a '$100 one mile long' to its '$5 foot long' menu.
Guerrilla marketing is getting kind of aggressive, huh?” “I know right? Eat fresh!
When they say takeout, they mean it.
Ironically, that’s not a Subway sandwich.
If I pay full fare, do I get it toasted?
That's not Kosher salami.
The "Turkey and Swiss" train may not take us all the way downtown, but it smells a lot better than the Number 7!
I thought we only asked for a foot long.
When did you become such a literalist?
You did say you wanted a subway!
The Whale Hoagie. Another hybrid species.
I forgot the ham and cheese local is running on the Reuben express line this weekend.
I don't care what they say. He's my Hero!
Yeah, but it runs all night.
They're running the expresso on the local tracks.
When’s dessert coming?
Mobey Hoagie - Captured and Preserved after swallowing Captain Trump.
Ah, that’s why they call it the “prep line”.
I think we'll need the large drink and chips.
Subway is taking this branding thing a bit too far.
Honey, we should take the next one. This one is over-stuffed.
An express with no peppers?
What are you waiting for, lets eat!
...And now I do not know which Subway it is.
This one's crowded. Let's wait for the grilled cheese.
The Germans sure knew how to camouflage submarines.
We're going to get sandwhiched
I told you we were waiting at a substation. (‘Told’ in italics. can’t do that in my phone....)
the greens certainly live large don't you think?
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A SUBWAY SANDWICH!!
Look. Franchise expansion !
It appears your car has been sandwiched in.
Mmmmm...Fresh baked whole wheat- I can barely smell the vomit.
What's a submarine sandwich doing down here?
No honey, that’s not our train, just some slices of deli meat in a cushioned vehicle hurdling together towards--where, I cannot say.
"Yeah, it's way too conceptual, but how long have we waited already?
It’s called “The Moby Dickwich”.
If this caption uses the word "subway", it is too obvious.
Herman, this is the sub weigh station, just like the sign said. I told you it's not what we were looking for.
What's a Passover observer to do?
Let's hope soup isn't next.
That one has onions, let's wait for the next one.
Wait. We are taking the vegetarian.
Do you want a diet soda with that?
the subway rates are now five dollars per foot long.
Great new subway it you're not a vegetarian.
I hope you don't mind, I ordered to-go
Wrong train- no pickle.
I told them, 'no tomatoes!'
Nah, not this one. I ordered without tomato.
Bae, I still prefer the abstractionists.
Lets wait, the next one may be turkey.
It looks like the Italian BMT, but do we want the Broadway Line or Canarsie Line?
Stop being such a literalist!
There'd be less confusion if you called it a hoagie.
Honey, I told you this was the wrong platform--we specifically asked for no tomatoes.
Let's wait, Harold. There's not even standing room in this one.
Nice! Looks like lunch is included.
The 5:15 Salami Special is on time today.
Look Mom, no teeth marks!
Privatization. They gave the contract to Disney.
Wait, that's the Italian, we want the chicken parm.
No - Let's wait... the meatball express is next.
Please stay back, this may be a nuclear sub!
Wow, honey, two subways in one. What a great idea!
This is the best subway!
I don’t think it is worth the weight.
Don't get on. The Pastrami going uptown is faster.
Let's wait for the Veggie.
Remember, no eating on the subway.
Talk about your sour dough.
Let’s wait for the next one. This one is practically overflowing.
Okay, this corporate identification has gone too far.
You were my hero when YOU were that big and long!
You're my hero
I think they're taking this all organic thing a little too literally.
Great! We can eat dinner on the way home!
Finally, a corporate marketing ploy that actually employs a literal interpretation to their product!
I think they have taken the Seamless ads too far.
I never liked the idea of driverless meal delivery.
That's some next-level branding.
The 8:05 to Hoboken is giving me indigestion.
Harry, I have been hearing strange things about our subway service!
Only in LA
That’s one fuckin’ big ass sandwich.
That's the visual pun express. It runs on groans.
Did we miss the meatball train?
No, ours is the tuna on rye.
It's the new Eat While You Ride!
Don't be a hero, the subway's grinding to a halt.
I know I said I wanted to go subway, but, c'mon!
The city is really taking the term 'subway' seriously.
I tell you it’s this recent low-fat diet fad that is responsible for the delays.
It's a hoagie in Philly
Even the rats are going gluten-free.
That's the number 9. I feel stuffed just looking at it.
It’ll be faster if we wait for the Meatball.
Could be worse. Could have been that can of Zema downtown.
It's the S train.
Honey, would you jump in front of a moving sandwich for me?
Let's wait for the next one. These ones cost five dollars.
No honey, that's the 40-foot long express, we want the 20-foot local.
No, not enough cheese. I'm waiting for the next one.
Let's wait for the next one. I've gone vegan.
If you travel by subway these days, you find yourself sandwiched between SO many people!
They may say this is its namesake, but some places it's called a hoagie.
The Markell's couldn't help wondering, "it's fast, cheap, & convenient...but is it safe?"
This is the last place I’d expect to see a hoagie.
Oh good, we won’t need to stop for food on the way home.
What did you expect?
I know we’re American but this is too far.
Subway stop at Subway stop -- had to happen sometimg
This will be faster than driving our footlong.
Stanley, I warned you about your puns.
Looks like our train to Pastrami-on-Rye is here.
Yeah! The express sub is finally here!
It's fast but fattening.
That one must have arrived from the meatpacking district.
wow. I am already thinking about leftovers
I hope they accept bit currency.
Maybe it's a promotion for Hoagy Carmichael revival.
You go ahead. I'm waiting for the GF train.
Just a bite before catching the 5:58?
Shall we wait for the express? It’s ham on rye.
Waiting for Dessert
That is someone else’s take-out order.
Ugh, turkey again? I was looking forward to roast beef week.
Let's wait for the meatball it'll be less crowded.
Is that an express or do we have to eat it at this station?
Don't they call it the metro in DC?
But I wanted a Jersey Mike's.
The Internet.
Wayward Journey of the Prodigal Pun
It's Jimmy Johns. Ours is the next one.
...and kosher, too...
Let's wait for the flatbread. It's more energy efficient.
So we just take this to the Yeast?
Personally, I would rather wait for the roast beef.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked to see the subway.
Finally! Meal service for the long ride to Jamaica!
Let's wait for the gluten free
Did you order the footlong BMT?
We want the one with no mayo ...
Didn't I say hold the tomatoes.
Thanks, but I'd rather wait for the burger
Submarine you call that a submarine....
It 's the express to Sandwich.
"This subway is not only clean and safe, it's quite satisfying".
This is my favorite - the 5:37.
It's the latest thing, edible subways.
These new subway cars really don't look that much more comfortable.
Maybe I have changed my mind about our lunch date.
Don't get near! Look at the guys he's grabbed already!
Oh, please! You know as well as I do turkey with lettuce and mayo on whole wheat always travels faster uptown at rush hour than the #6.
Glad we got the upgrade from tuna.
"Subway"??? No, I meant subway.
Our meatball should be here in three minutes.
NOT the subway I was expecting.
SUBWAY... Ride Fresh.
We specifically ordered wheat bread and no tomatoes.
This is not quite what I expected from the exhibit on American heroes...
No drink or cookie trailer? Wait for the Jimmy Johns express.
Well, we are below sea level.
I didn't know Donald Trump would be here.
No darling, it's not a sign to add gluten back to our diet.
This is why I prefer Jersey Mike's.
Subway has really upped their marketing strategy.
All aboard the Subway!
I’m taking the BLT south.
Let's wait: That's the 2:05 express to Clotville.
I guess this must be the Subway subway
Next time, I'm getting a salad.
This one's full.
You take this one. I'll wait for the meatballs.
Which came first?
These $5 fares are getting out of hand.
Looks like everyone is sandwiched in!
I asked for no pickles
I usually take the Quizno’s
Is that vegan?
Fast food again Chelsea?
Remember when Subway was fast food? Right until the MTA took over.
Let's wait for one with no onions.
100 cars flaccid? sorry dave im leaving you
This is boloney! That's not 12 feet.
Moby, we hardly knew ya!
Honey, did you order a SUBWAY?
Wow. That's what color looks like!
Let's wait for the gluten-free train.
IS THAT THE UPTOWN SUBWAY?
Honestly, if they’re going to raise the price they don’t have to try so hard to impress us.
The next one looks like a bottle of antacid.
It's a local. Let's wait for an express.
Oh, look Marty! It's one of those site-specific art installations.
I'll take the right side!
The subway is hungry. (My 5-year-old son, Sam, wrote this.)
Now introducing the HSP line -- ham, salami, provolone.
This one's going downtown, but I think we should wait for the one without any mayo.
I said no mustard.
For Whom the Lunch Bell Tolls.
Let's wait for the next one, too much mayo on this one.
We could take this one or wait for the meatball sub that arrives in 5 minutes.
I know it's Local but let's wait for the Express.
This new Subway Ad campaign is maddening, that's the uptown "ham and cheese", we want the crosstown "tuna".
Is it all you can eat until the next train?
I’m not that hungry.
Where's your chain saw when we need it?!
Maybe the next one will have the spicy mustard you like.
Go for it, son. you'll be a hit at lunch.
Let's wait for the next one; this one is too filling.
And even that one probably has no more than 400 calories.
It's only 5.1 million calories if you get it without cheese.

I thought we ordered the meatball.
Gosh, there's gotta be a joke here. Breadway... sandwichway... I don't know, I give up.

At least we're not in Boston, or we'd be flooded by now.
That's a sandwich.
I'm waiting for the grinder cartoon.
At least it's not a Rail.
The subway sandwich had a whale of time.
I'm waiting for the toasted cars.
Welcome to Great White Sushi!
Hello Munchausen syndrome
When you said you wanted the "Kick Ass" size, and they told us to go down to platform 14, I wasn't expecting this.
That was the idea I gave the Pentagon of how to disguise our nuclear subs.
Join a Two-Hout Nostalgia group in your area if your good old days weren’t really worth remembering.
*Announced over intercom "The Bronx Bound Rye train won't be running between 63rd and 68th."
Well, it is grotesque, but at least it's not Jared.
This MUST be the train to Bridgeport.
I told you we should have taken the Pizza Express!
'I know but the train's air conditioning usually works."
That's the second largest hoagie I've ever seen!
DEMOCRACY..Do. The math If the three parts are 2/3 3/4 & 1/3 and the median is 75%..... Honey, does that represent ? “What we have left (or) What we have lost “?
It's too mcuh bread!
Let's wait for the next one. This one does not have any pickles
According to Yelp, this is the best footlong sub sandwich in all of Rhodes. It sure is colossal!
It's alright honey, getting sandwiched is eco-friendly.
If only I were Roz Chast
Relax, I'll grab us a seat near the mustard. Relax, we can ride it as far as dessert.
This never happens in the Metro.
It’s the fast food concept with a spin off into public transportation.
Do you think the corporation is bringing back the slogan "My Way" or "Right Before Your Eyes"?
When franchises get too big, they start desperate advertising -- it won't really eat us
Smells like feet
I'm pretty sure Subway stole that idea from Oscar Meyer.
Subway has taken a page out of Amazon's playbook and taken over New York's public transit..just in time fir Restaurant Week.
I think gluten might be striking back.
It's no longer your grandmother's graffiti.
It’s the foot long!
I realize this is the Subway, but I was hoping for something more mobile.
Sure it smells but think of all the gluten we threw away before the Light-Rye-Rail took off. Its gotta be better for the environment.
I told you not have a large one at 11 o'clock at night all by yourself. But nooo, you wouldn't listen. 'I can handle it.' you said. And now just look at the horrible dream your having!
Do you think it knows?
The New York Subway marketing department is out of control.
If I hadn't had that pizza last night I'd be hallucinating sushi right now.
Wow, this condo is really fancy - it even comes with submarine parking.
New Yorkers call it 'the train.'
Seems like a branding problem.
It definitely adds warmth to the organs resonance.
Take out has taken on a new meaning!
I did not know they let submarines in the subway.
The Express Subway is not Fast Food.
They really are trying to entice ridership, aren't they?
It's from just before the dinosaurs went extinct.
Quick Susan, call the FBI. There is a torpedo in the subway.
Bet that is a six car train.
Do you think it'll have a quiet car?
I prefer a taxi to a subway.
So, if we need a ride to Flushing, we go to the sandwich shop?
I can't believe they voted not to put mayo on it.
I remember when it was five dollar footlong fares.
I can't stop dreaming of last night together.
Well, better a sandwich than a dessert.
"Today is the first day of the rest of your life" support group
Let it go, I'm not a piece of meat!
Let's wait for the express Meatball.
Subway Subs!
You win-it's not a hoagie.
Is that a subwhale?
Thoughts on the city’s new public transportation system?” “Eh, a little hoagie.
Well... now we see why this is the least crowded subway platform ever.
And this is the recipient of the US Greatest Hero Medal
Why is the subway so dirty?
Leipää... leipää...
I think the product placements have gone too far. At least as far as Ditmas Boulveard anyway.
The sandwich is impressive but wait until you see the size of the toilet bowl after one of these.
I didn't realize they'd started serving lunch on the express train
Always thinking of food while on the subway.
I think we're parked behind the third jalapeño.
Great, even the signs are now obese.
“I saw a more disgusting one on turdy-turd street”.
Literally, we are getting "on" the train today.
I know it’s Rye and no mayo, but the portion size still bothers me
Lunch is a little early today
Butter late than never
The best way to serve a sub.
I hope we can get a seat in subway.
They should have known it is only like an oven down here summertime.
Sure, it's fast, but now the rat problem's even worse!
Hoagie's a big hero now.
So that’s the whole enchilada. Hunh.
Do you think they remembered the Russian dressing?
This is stupid. There's too much labeling in the cartoon already; any caption would be redundant.
Jared must have ordered in for himself and his jail buddies at Englewood
Looks like a cold cut combo - let's wait for the next one.
No wonder we got our tickets back. It's not chicken, bacon, ranch.
Hmm, does this line go under water?
That's poetic license.
Ethel told me she and Ronnie would try to hold us seats at their table.
Wondering... This is not five loaves and two fishes. It must be one loaf and five fishes.
Mmmm...hasty.
No image............
Tuna next stop! - Subway conductor
The meal deal comes with a seat and a “don’t talk to me” scowl.
It's called the reverse Jerrod.
At least this half-baked plan to fix the MTA seems tasty.
- Wait for it's fully stopped.
J
I got it....we'll call it underground meat.
The way I see things, "a little peckish" doesn't seem to fit the bill.
Must have something to do with that trademark lawsuit I read about.
Going to Queens, looks like.
Oh-no, we will be processed just like that!
I just hope it's not alive.
They keep getting larger.
Let's let the Subway subway go by. Maybe the next one is Pret a Manger.
Look it’s on sale!
It just seems so Seamless.
Who's eating who?
Looks like the L will be delayed again.
I read the City's Infrastructure Improvement Plan, I guess the train was an unfunded mandate.
And to think it comes with a truck load of soda and a craft full of chips.
Oh man, where did we leave OUR sandwich?
I guess we can thank the "residents" for the "seeds"; the little rats!
Wow! Dominoe's is over the top!
Subway's getting a bit too enthusiastic with all this sponsoring...
It’s built on a platform.
I never suspected that turkey and anchovies would become a subway line.
I told you the guys at the MTA make a lot of bread.
Every time I ride down to Times Square I get this weird craving for cold cuts.
A little too obvious, isn't it?
Well, now I know why they called it the SUBway!
And we were worried about the blizzard-like conditions. I guess even the subs need a remiss. At least this sub will get us where we need to go on time. Give or take the mayo..
It's called Color.
Let's take the local--no onions!
I hate the pastrami on there, can we take the 12 inch?
Mind the capicola.
The guy who always smells like ham requested it.
Let's wait for the next one. It's a mayo.
"Subway," get it?
And they say sandwich making isn't an art form.
Um, is it too late to hop on the Keto train?
What is this? A joke?
I told you - no one in Chelsea takes Uber after openings anymore.
Throwing trash on the tracks is getting out of hand
We'll have to wait for the next train.
Just as crowded as the old subway but lettuce not worry about that.
Impressive, but what I want to see is when it rots!
Let's get on the next one. This one is full of food coloring.
Sure,I'll eat. There's a nice section the rats haven't got at.
Yuck, at least the Lex Ave chews before swallowing
I do know what the last stop is on this route!
It's the new ad campaign ,since they lost there spokes person .
The seeded roll really decreases transit time.
'The Minimalism exhibit is in the next room."

Don’t worry, it’s more than a foot-long
This is the platform where my mother almost died. We still don't know who saved her.
Nostalgia...Don’t put it off.
I am cutting out bread!
Let's wait for the next one. It's the no-onion express!!
Maybe it's the new self-driving sandwich.
Can we pay with our visa?
If it has to be like it is inside, I'd take this over sardines any day.
Odd man out!!
I love it when you surprise me with dinner, breakfast, and lunch.
...is Abramovic in there somewhere?...
Well, I hope you are gluten tolerable...
Super sized self service
I had heard they were getting a sub. You take this one; I don’t like lettuce.
Don't eat the brown acid.
You did say extra mayo?
So that's why this metro smells like Subway.
They forgot the mayonnaise
And right when I started my new diet
I see they have the special sub running. Clears out all the critters during track work.
Hold my tomatoes.
Whats a grinder doing down here?
I just flew in on a Blimpie and now I'm completely lost.
They said "Take the Tomato 2 Stops to the Sunflower" but this looks as close to that as we can get.
That moment when people don’t finish sentences lol
Offline status updates.
You're joking, right?
Now THAT's...
Let's get some Blimpie.
They’ve really taken advertising too far.
It's for Trump's lunch. It's for Trump's lunch.
It’s a subway from Subway.
Do you think it's gluten free?
Actual footage of Ron, Hermione and Harry at 63 years old.
Did Whole Foods go out of business??
Why is there a giant hoagie on the subway tracks?
Wow, who knew there's a Subway down here! Let's get a sub.
Maybe a minor ambush, but not the Trojan Horse, and anyway we're at 14th street.
It’s too early for lunch, Myron!
Wow - the advertising on these new subway cars is amazing.
And.............where's the jar of mustard?
Good thing this complex has a gym honey, since we have a lot of eating to do if we want to park here.
I guess they went to Jared
Your attention please: The onions are being held by supervision.
Are there any without mayonnaise?
I here the driver is a real artist
Whadayah mean! The only hero I know is Tom Brady!
That’s the new thing. They call it “the compound train”. Sounds tasty to me!
I think their whole marketing strategy has gone astray since that Jared debacle...
Looks like they skimped on the Mayonnaise again.
I get it now! We're underground, in the subway station - so this must be a work of subliminal art, from the local Subway shop! It's sublime!
Nothing happens until the rush hour.
I don't want to sound overly critical John, but the other establishment has a higher rating from the Health Department.
That's a whale of a substitue!

Brief demo
----------

Let's read in the data from contest 553:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import caption_contest_data as ccd
   >>> df = ccd.summary(553)
   >>> df.head()
      rank  funny  ...  contest                                            caption
   0     1     87  ...      553                      I'd like to see other people.
   1     2     74  ...      553  I know that look, you're not going to let this...
   2     3     63  ...      553                      I'd like to see other people.
   3     4     54  ...      553  What a delightful coincidence. I'm also recent...
   4     5     61  ...      553              Maybe his second week will go better.

Let's look at the funniest caption:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df.iloc[0]
   rank                                          1
   funny                                        87

   unfunny                                     157
   count                                       328

What are the funniest captions?

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pprint(df.caption[:5].tolist())
   ["I'd like to see other people.",

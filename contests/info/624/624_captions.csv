I'm feeling so awkward . . . . Nobody told me to come au natural!
I beat Hillary.
Hey dude, what did you do to deserve being buried alive?”
“Um they said I shouldn’t have helped Trump become president.
Keep waving at the staff all you want, pal. The service in this place is lousy.
You’re new here aren’t you?
Hey, hey, hey.  Complaints go in the box over there.
I get it, I get it, 'this too shall pass'.
They told me I was going undercover
You got buried next to the tree of life too?
And I thought my last neighbor was annoying...
I get it, I died a month ago. But, I'd still rather face Death in the eye than continue to watch Trump's antics!
Rest in peace my ass!
Yes, yes, I know you were gluten-free. SEE where it's gotten you?

What can I say, I didn't eat organic
Been here long?
I had to get buried next to this bonehead!
What's the rush?

Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare the life out of you.
I can't get any peace in here.
Hey! Show some spine!
Sure Carol, you look thin but are you really going to call it the Green-Wood Diet?
You've obviously been here longer.
Are you serious? I asked to be cremated!
Had a suit that looked just like that. And hopes & dreams and a shiny new pair of wingtips.
I told you for the last time, you're too old for me!
Best if I just lay here and play dead.
Hey, buddy, that r.i.p. DOESN'T mean “renegotiate in perpetuity.” Now shut up!
I really don't care, do you?
I've always been composed, so I'm taking my time.
Did I overdress?
Sorry if you thought this was gonna be all pearly gates and harp music roomie!

I don't know! 
All I did is use Trump and Treason in the same sentence???
During life I find out that Santa doesn't exist, now I die and I find out that "til death do us part" was a lie!
Don’t worry, I fell for the guaranteed weight loss thing too.
I give up.  What rhymes with "Just Married"?
At this stage, I would rather not deflower you.
Yes, you lost the 50 pounds, but you're still not attractive
Look, I just want to rest in peace.  Is that too much to ask?
...as I was saying,...
No, I don't remember when you used to change my diapers.
But just to say it one time again - and I say it all the time - there was no collusion!
All I said was, 'Why don't you try telling the truth?'
But I only said maybe the Russians did it...
You were scarier when you were alive.
Even in death, Harry could not escape his noisy neighbors.

All things considered, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
Ok, fine. I agree you do seem to have senority here.

Hey, newbie. I’m Alex. We’re going to be neighbors for eternity. Isn’t that great? Do you like yacht rock? Tuesdays are taco night. I’m a pescatarian. I see you got the lid off by yourself. I don’t know why they buried me naked. I love cribbage...
Is this Heaven or Hell???
Arguing about politics is what killed me, so please shut up!
I'm not nearly as happy to see you as you are to see me.
Don't try and make me the bad guy for eating right.
All I said was she has a nice rack.
No, thanks, I'm all flowered up, but how long before the wool suit stops itching?
Here to stay, or just dropping by?
How did I get stuck with a morning person?
Great. Another annoying character in my plot line.
It's clothing-optional?
Until death do you part ,my ass.
Try it for free they said.
I sold Facebook at $19.  I sold Facebook at $19.  I sold Facebook at $19.  I ...
Well this is awkward... I’m not wearing any clothes.
What can I say? I asked to be buried next to her.
Just because you're next to the tree, 
it doesn't mean she loved you more.
Hello, I've been dying to meet you!
I'd like to add you to my professional network on ExtinctIn!
Too soon! .., I’m not even decomposed yet!
I was told I'd rest in peace?
The report of my death was highly exaggerated.
Flowers won’t do it.  I’v Got a bone to pick with you.
You've gotta be kidding me. Where's my smart phone? And where's the lid to this damn coffin!?
I decompose slowly ...Many corpses find that sexy.
So this is social networking in the afterlife?!
Come here often? What was your "Major"?
Welcome! Don’t worry, the dress code relaxes for all of us after awhile.
Just my luck, stuck next to a genial extrovert till the end of time.
Here. I’m done with these. Oh, and take your time.
No worries, you'll shrink into it.
Oy, I came here to get away from this guy.
Does Resting In Peace cost extra?!
Would you just let me rest in peace?
Coming or going?
Thanks! How did you know that today I would have been 163.
Ahh, the one time I'm buried without my headphones!
Hi there, I'm not waving, just encouraging the worms to go your way
Ma!  Yes, you were right. Everybody knows I had clean underwear on.
Hi im chris hansen with dateline nbc
Just because we're neighbors doesn't mean we're friends.
You"ll eventually get to the bare bones of it all
I thought my accountant said I'd be buried in debt, not buried in dirt.
Hi! I’m the welcome wagon.
Styx and stones may break my bones but Trump can never hurt me.....
Didn’t we have a ‘till-death-do-we-part’ agreement?
I  HATE BLIND DATES.
You wanted a tombstone AND a coffin lid?  Where do you think you are,The Ritz?
I’m trying to rest in peace over here! I got all eternity to hear your life story!
At least someone loves you down here, Donald!
Ed knew if he made eye contact, this guy would be talking to him forever.
Rest in pieces?
Jesus-effing-Christ...give a guy a chance to decompose.
What do you mean, until death do us part?
And bone spurs got you out, too?
I have some bones to pick.
I can't think outside the box!
How could this happen to me? Don't they know who I am!
Sorry, I’m not interested in anyone over 30
Bones, is that you?
You'll fit better once you're skeletonized
You'll enjoy this neighborhood.  It's quiet.
I just got out of a relationship, so I'm not looking to jump back into anything.
I hope you don’t feel I’m too fresh!
At last.  I'm ready to come out of the closet.
Long time no see!
Yeah, I see you finally lost the weight but now you look anorexic.
'It's New York... You're not supposed to know your neighbors...'
Seems like I just know every body
I just thought there'd be privacy down here at least.
Son, son it's me!
Who gave this place such a good Yelp review?
If you say “this rattles my bones” one more time...
Great!  I've been stuck in the clothing optional area.
Oh, hey. I didn't recognize you. You've lost so much weight... and muscle... and skin...
Don't worry. It's cramped, but it's rent controlled.
'Till death do us part' applies to both our deaths, Harold!
Say what you will. That anti-aging cream still works!
'Talk about a neighbour from Hell!'
Hey there! How'd life treat you?
Oh crap, my tomb-mate’s an extrovert.
So they lied - there's no dress code.
Like I told the last guy, leave me alone or I have a right to stand my ground.
Mom! Get out of my room!
What the hell is SHE doing here?
I thought he said 'till death do us part'?
Could we please just leave it at ‘till death do us part’?
Thanks, but my allergies have been killing me.
No, I don't want to hear about your great, great, great, great, great-grandchildren.
I'm still waiting for the white light.
This is why I hate the middle plot.
No, mom, I don't remember Cindy Curran from the 3rd grade.
Think outside the box, they said. Look where that got me.
Next time you should get embalmed!
What can I say?!  You're dead to me!
Look buddy, down here nobody cares about the president.
Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda......you newbies are all alike !
Welcome Wagon
What part of 'R.I.P.' don't you understand?
My eyes may be decomposed but I think you look beautiful tonight.
It’s killing me: I can’t remember if I closed the gas oven before I left the house.
Fake news! Rumours of my death are being greatly exaggerated!
I still have my own teeth too, I'm lookin' on the bright side.
Here lies Billy Johnson, he was buried next to his ex-"clingy" girlfriend.
You"re it
New guy! It's over! Put a lid on it!
Clatter, Clatter, Clatter. . . Is that all you have to say?
Unfriend me. Please!
Unlike the world above, we pay it forward down here. Welcome.
Wait, I'm not breaking down because I'm a composer, is that what you're saying?
For this I wasted a good suit !
Bob hadn’t realised life after death was a thing!
Is that all there is?
Hey, I worked myself to death so don't be calling me lazy-bones!
Well, hell - so much for purgatory.
'What could go wrong?' Right?
For crying out loud, there’s not even room to roll over, let alone resting in peace!
Hey Honey, I told you I'd wait.
No one was listening then and no one is listening now.
No thanks.  I'm allergic.
Hey! Yeah, over here, can you keep it down? You could wake the dead!
This better not be heaven.
We’ve done the til death do us part thing—I want an exhumation.
Morris, your instructions were, "do not resuscitate "
Is that a welcome or a farewell?
More like, 'rest in pieces'.
Trump's Medicare did this to me."  "You'll get used to it; I've been here since Nero.
What part of RIP do you not understand?
Nope.  I didn't bring a vase.
Stop it!  Jazz hands creep me out.
Welcome to Schadenfreude!
THEY TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO HELL!
I should've been more concerned it was a Jehovah's Witness cemetery.
I wouldn't keep complaining about being buried alive if you still looked like you did in your profile.
Hey newby, let's see dem bones!
For the love of God Mr  Fitzwaller, I am no longer seeing you for psychiatric counseling.
I don't date older corpses.
When you die, the skeleton in your closet dies with you
Here in New York it means Rent Is Prohibitive.
"Hey sailor, new in town?"
Look- I'm sorry I didn't call you back. But now we have all the time in the world to catch up.
I knew I shouldn't have listened to Siri.
No, I don't want to be your friend on Deadbook!
I dont know, I just got here.
Well, yeah, I saw your tombstone, but I thought it might be a different Ned Ryerson.
The family plot, no getting away from Mom.
Okay, now what?
Feel the city shakin and everybody’s quakin’ and we’re stayin’ alive! Staying alive! Ah! Ah! Ah’ Ah! Staying aliiiive!
Ugh. Not you!
How did Becky from office supplies get into the supervisor graveyard? It's like I worked all those years for nothing.
She said close your eyes and make a wish.
Now stop singing "You don't send me flowers anymore!"
How am I supposed to rest in peace down here?!?
Hi! Nice suit. You must be new here.
I see dead people.
I know, I know. In sickness and in health!
I did not cancel "Six Feet Under"................
Hi there John, you never replied to my email.
Oh, great! Eternity with an Amway guy!
Sure..you CLAIM you're a blonde!
Ask about our carbon recycling plan!
I can overlook a lot . . .but plastic flowers?
At least it’s roomier than my apartment.
Can you accept love from a gender-neutral skeleton, you hunk?!
Danced on the wrong grave, pal
You're a little stiff and formal now . . . even cold.  That's fine.  I've got an eternity.
Trump pleases most Americans as he pulls ahead in his race to hell.
Hopefully check in is faster than check out.
Well, sorry! How could I have known Trump was a liar?
Hi! I'm Louis, your eternal neighbor!
Honey, please, it’s until death do us part!
Please, Mom, I'm gonna die of embarassment!
Don't blame me, I didn't vote for him.
Hey  Does anybody else think these rooms smell musty?
The Curse of the Undead Mansplainer.
Men's warehouse
Why did I agree to work with a skeleton staff?
What the hell is going on up there?
It's polyester. Never wrinkles either
You're going to have to do better than flowers to jump my bones
Hey man!  Just remember that good coffins make good neighbors.  And we'll get along fine.
I said I'd be your friend  if its the last thing I do!
Look... I just got here and I'm not ready for that kind of intimacy. Plus you're old enough to be my Great-Great-Great Grandmother
How am I supposed to know how many fingers you're holding up?
Still, I get no respect!
I was sure they'd make an exception this time.
For gods sake, Morris. Enough about your crooked accountant!
If I'd known about the preservatives, I wouldn't have eaten all that McDonald's.
Welcome and congratulations, this is a very exclusive cemetery, people are just DYING to get in... too soon?
Hey, lady, I'm just not into older women.
I was counting on death parting us.
I'm killing them down here. Did you here the one about...?
I told you that suit was to die for.
At least you were spared the autopsy
I tell my kids, 'I wish I could see your mother once more'.  So they bury me alive.  I don't get no respect!
I told you- good drainage and no piranha!
Can't talk now. I'm underground.
He knows I'm not dead, right?
Hi, Jimmy.  It's Dad.  I was worried that you might not recognize me after all these years.
Can I get a little 'R.I.P. and Quiet' here?
Can a body rest in peace or what?
Keeping up with the Boneses
Who knew we had to pay for extra leg room?
Honey, just give me a minute to decompose.
So I'm new to the neighborhood...
Hi, they call me Rip
Neglecting to clean out that closet is going to haunt me.
Surprisingly I'm not dying to meet you!
Sorry, I don't smoke
This is not the cruise I booked!
And I thought being alive was tough...
The room is small, but rent is dirt cheap!
Sometimes deleting Tinder off your phone isn't sufficient.
Why they put me in the nudist section?”
Yes, honey. I can tell you’ve lost weight.
Welcome to the underground!
Another noisy neighbor! - and loud enough to wake the dead.
Don't even go there, Vladimir. Our bromance was over after the midterm elections.
So you saved on the co-pay; big deal.
I'm so over this dead-end job.
Really? NOW?
Dead Sullivan
I thought I left all of my skeletons in the closet!!!!
My obit notice distinctly said no flowers!
I’m the healthiest man you’ll ever meet, trust me
Listen!  I'm just here for a rest.  Nothing permanent.
Well, at least its rent-controlled.
This is getting old.
Thought I finally found my safe space. Then my ex-wife shows up.
Alright! I heard you! Her emails
Quit calling me "Lazy Bones!"
Near death experience
Till death do us part" means just that
I'm sorry, but our time is up
Let's pick up on this next week
What? You get me dressed up with nowhere to go!
Thought Bubble . . . "It was so peaceful after she died."
Leave me alone, honey! Our vows said 'til death.
Okay, we can do dinner. Your coffin or mine?
Why are you asking me,I just got here!
‘Till death do us part’ was unfortunately not the case for Betty.
Anybody think my speeches run too long?
You're here to decompose, not decompress.
As my financial advisor, I trusted you!
What did you mean when you told me you couldn't go on living without me?
Does it ever end.
Can’t a guy get some peace down here?
I kind of just got here and you’re regifting me with my own flowers?
If this were a joke it would be too soon!
No collusion!
No Gloria! Too little; too late.
Arrghhh! I thought our marriage was until "death do us part"?
Sorry, not really into nudism
There must be some misunderstanding. Doesn't until death do us part mean that we are to be apart after death?
Get ready — the Danse Macabre starts in five minutes!
I can see you are new here
I'm looking for a younger woman.
No, I can't come out and play.
Hey you!  I am gonna kill myself if I have to listen to that Nixon impression for the rest of eternity.
Just when I thought I'd FINALLY get some peace.
My slow metabolism is a curse, I tell ya.
Hey, Newbie!  Keep it down in there!  The dead tell no tales!
You'll feel better once you get that suit off.
Hi, my names Adolf, I've been waiting for you to arrive
Oh well, finding love late is better than never.
Rest in Peace?  I don't think so.
Welcome to the neighborhood. It may take some time for you to fit in.
Sorry I already gave someone my heart. That's why I'm here!
It's not you, it's me. I donated my heart for a transplant.
I was told to dress for the after life.
Swipe left
Don't they have a dress code?
Heigh ho, big fella.  Come here often?
I'll never get rid of the IRS!!!
As my decorator used to say, flowers enliven any dead spaces.
I wasn't snoring so they thought I was dead!  Can anyone hear me?
Been waiting long?
What is this, a Tim Burton film?
I'm feeling a bit overdressed.
Wouldn't you know it, Mort, we're neighbors again!
Nuthin, there’s nuthin new , I tell ya.
Till death due us part?
It will get better...
I should never have joined that secret society.
The motto is ‘rest in peace’ but we’re really quite a sociable group. You’ll see.
Nancy Pelosi still 'leading' the Democrats?"
Oh great. Another game of charades.
Ugh! Why didn't they spring for the lid option?
Till death do us part, now please may I RIP
Ooh, hello. It's been a long time since I've seen a man.
Try the new Atrophy Diet," she said. Who else thought that would be a good idea
Lucky me, my new neighbor, Chatty Kathy....
Maxine, I tell you for the twentieth time...Yes we got adjoining graves, but I am not and never will join you in a rousing chorus of "I've got you under my skin."
Dammit! This wasn't what I meant when I said I wanted to be boss of the underworld.
Welcome to the WWWhhhhhhaaaaatttttttt??????
Stop it Rodney! You’re still killing me!
Ya know, this sucks bigly.
This is what happens when you marry a cougar and don't read the pre-nup!
Is this all there is? Is there no more to life than this?
Ooh! Ooh! Ask me! Ask me! I know!!!
Hey.  Anyone here from out of town?
Now she says, "Yes!"
I tell ya, I get no respect, there I was minding my own business ...
Hi neighbor. Their called tiny houses now!
You must be new here.
Till death do us part", they said..
Hi there! Looking good - so far.
Welcome to the 'hood!
Why do I have to wear a suit when the other guy gets to be naked?
I thought it was "Til Death Do You Part"...I never signed up for this
Hey, good timing!  We're welcoming newbies Friday night at the mausoleum"
Somehow I always sit next to a chatty Kathy
this conversation is dead serious!
I know it's tight, but after a few years you'll have much more room.
Sorry, I don't dig it.
I'm Roger.  Can you believe this?  I mean, really
Welcome, we don’t get a lot of new comers anymore with cremation all the rage. So tell me who is president.
You look great, but I’d rather kill myself again than join your Low Carb Club.
I told them I wanted a closed casket
Good lord! What happened to "til death do us part?"
Ha ha ha ha ha...a...a...a...and then...and then...stay with me now...and then a priest, a rabbi, and an Imam walk into a bar...ho ho ho, the punchline will kill you...
Everything else I can deal with, but my real estate agent promised quiet neigbors.
It's why I like timeshare rentals -- the neighbors are temporary.
Why have I been buried in the Van Winkle family cemetery?
Who knew a bag of peanut M&Ms, three shots of tequila, two beers, and a Percocet was mortal?
Ya, Ya mom, you did warn me.
Frankiiieee! Over here! Oh, just wait 'til the girls hear about this!
It's too late for that now.
Well, at least it's in Manhattan...
well hello there.welcome to the neighborhood.
Just my luck, eternity next to this guy.
Ludwig the composer, and Clarence the decomposer.
So I say, Nothing is certain"  
"I hear 'ya, Death and Taxes wait for no man, yeah?
Buddy, PLEASE, just Rest In Peace.
Ehh, you're not really my type, I'm looking for someone with a bit more substance.
Enough with the mansplaining.
You're lucky to have gotten that space. People are just dying to get in here.
What is it about RIP that you don't understand?
I’m not looking for date, I just got single..
Hey buddy, I just came for a fitting.
How do you lose weight, then keep it off?”
You mean to tell me that DEATH is not FATAL!
Just give it some time and you'll fit right in.
I thought you guys took August off.
How come there's never a shrink around when you really need one?
Hey, uh...I'm required to tell you that I am a registered coffin offender.
I still have to make small talk!?
I should have been cremated an avoided these post modern dating rituals
Welcome! You've obviously come dressed for a formal occasion.
Few analysts are this dedicated.
I don't recognize your face but your breath is familiar.
What the hell am I gonna put 'em in?
Hi Babe! I see you went with the cheaper coffin after all. Don't worry, you'll have more shoulder room after a month.
Hi, looks like you are new here. You got to take it lying down.
Yo, over here...stop whining, I’m the one who got the polonium”
Can we please skip the "welcome to the neighborhood"  routine.
Welcome, neighbor!  The last guy was exhumed a century ago and never returned. 
 I've been really lonely.  Any inkling that might happen to you, 'cus I'd hate to get too friendly?
You're supposed to be pushing them up!
Couldn't you have placed me next to someone with less energy?
All this because I forgot to ask "May I?"
New to these parts?
I can't smell the roses.
Enough already, Bernie.  Your fifty minutes was up over thirty years ago.
I think it was all the GMO.
Hi, there! I'm guessing you didn't go gentle into that good night. They've got a therapist down here that can help you work on your anger management issues.
I DID tell you to drop dead. Still.....No.
Seems just like yesterday I was the new guy on the row.
I told you I was buried in a dead end job.
Stop already! That “come hither” look is what got me here in the first place!
You're the new guy? Welcome to the neighborhood!
Relax!  I'm not ready.  But—I bet you knocked them dead—when you had skin.
I hate these people who are always telling me to have a nice day.
This is why I hate blind dates.
Okay, so I did wish for more "grassroots support"  from that voodoo woman in the New Orleans constituency.....
Traffic.
Well this is just great.
I may have lost the plot.
I thought the daisies were included!"
You're making it really hard for me to act based solely on sex and skin color down here!
What can I say, peaceful cheap room and board?
Don't worry. The ants only tickle, but the worms will make you sneeze.
No way I'm spending eternity next to a freaking nudist!
I said I wanted a quieter office.
You think you've got it bad? My kids are using my twitter account to apologize for my previous tweets!
Fox New s Host: 
all i said was Trump should tone down the rhetoric and they freakin buried me!
Hey, did you see what Stephen Colbert did to your theater?
Yes. OK, fine. If there is a zombie apocalypse, we can be brain buddies.
All my life they said I looked great for my age. Lot of good it did me.
I take it back! My wife would be preferable to a car salesman!
I don't think I'm quite ready for another dating service.
"Maybe if I roll over she'll get the message that it's time to rest in peace.
It was cheaper than buying a bomb shelter.
STFU!  Don't you know what 'R.I.P.' means?!
What is it that you still don’t understand about rest in PEACE?
BTW wi-fi is horrible down here.
Welcome to the neighborhood you're going to love how peaceful and quite it is!
This is not a wave "hello"; this a signal for you to shut up and let me Rest In Peace.
It was just a soft-tissue injury. There's nothing wrong with MY bones.
Do you still want to talk to me about reverse mortgages?
And that 'Talk to the hand' come-back is so passé.
You're six feet under, no bones about it, must still pay taxes.
The reason they buried you alive Mr. Tarantino is because you won’t shut up!
Oh Lord! It's going to be hell in this suit.
I thought I would finally have some peace and quiet.
I didn't expect Welcome Wagon down here.
Sarte was right, “He’ll is other people.”
You're making me feel lousy about knocking you off for the insurance.
You new guys always show up overdressed!
What's new? You don't want to know!
Hey, will you pipe down?  I’m trying to get some sleep.
My coffin is too small, my neighbor keeps knocking and I requested a root view. Rest in peace?
And so I say to her 'Fine, if chivalry is dead, then so am I'.
But, I was a vegan and wore Armani suits.
I’m what you’re going to look like in 20 years!
So I take  it, there's no buffet!
Think Grateful Dead music, my favorite is “A touch of grey”.   Flowers?
This is not the rent control apartment my parents left me!
You seem to take a bare bones approach to courting.
You think you're bored now, wait about a hundred years.
Quit your waving already, can’t you see I’m trying to Rest In Peace?
Down here you can "lie" all the time and no one will care!
Hope you don't snore.
Diet or no diet we all end up in the same place.
And here I thought I could look forward to ‘resting in peace’.
Merrily, merrily, merrily merrily, life is but a dream.
I appreciate the hospitality, but I really don't see myself fitting in here...
Oh, God. It's Arthur, my insurance salesman.
At least we're insulated from all the 'fake news'.
I'm afraid our time is up.
I’m dead, right? I ‘m friggin’ DEAD, I don’t got a bleepin’ penny to my name, and this guy is busting my balls about some river cruise!
Clothes may make the man but we are still dead
Thought it was over.
Don't tell me what the Founding Fathers would have done; I was one of them!
Yes, I was the CEO of a Botox company, you don’t have to rub it in
Calm down. Your suit will fit better soon.
Can you give me a minute,  I just got here...
I understand neither why I have been buried alive nor why a skeleton is waving at me!
I specifically requested not to be in nudist cemetery.
Enough with the lawyer jokes already!
So glad to be here tonight, such a lively audience. Anybody else here dead? Ah yes, you sir, in the coffin there - where are you from?
Ah jeez, I should have paid attention to all those theology nerds who told me that the immediate ascension of the soul to Heaven at the moment of death is a misconception and we have to wait for bodily resurrection at the end of time, jeez.
Wanna bone down here? It's a bit lonely down here.
Welcome!! Did you bring snacks??
It’s grandpa...what do you mean you don’t recognize me?
But who even knows all the lyrics to "Dem Bones" anyway?
Stop! Look at you, you're skin and bones!
And here I thought my last neighbor was annoying...
No! That's not how you play dead! You got a long way to go....
I said I'd even follow you to the grave, not that I'd also be roommates.
I'm pretty sure it says ' Rest In PEACE'!
Where have all MY  flowers gone, long time passing?
I'm not into cougars
I thought we were going business casual.
Serenity now?
It won't be so warm in here after you lose a few pounds.
Beats Tinder.
Meredith, I only married you for the money
I did not know that death was clothes optional.
Hi, I'm your afterlife neighbor Cedric. I was a CPA for fifty years - boy do I have some stories for you.
I have no idea where the Bardo is
Do you have any idea of who I was?
Could I BE any more dead?
Ugh. Suburban neighbors ...
For the boat ride to Paradise I have to listen to jokes and be entertained by Dead Skeleton?
We've been over this before, coffin lids are for suckers.
Are you on NextDoor?
What me worry?
Okay, okay, I gave you those diet pills but that's a thin excuse to take revenge
I told that damn undertaker to go light on the embalming fluid.
you must be the new one
Oy vey, my best suit, no cash and the Halloween dude, Mama-a-a!!
Who Knew?
Sorry, I’m new to this.
Wave all you want but I am bone tired.
At least buy me dinner before trying to bone me!
Hi! Can I join you? The tree is crowding me out... Oh wait you are ALIVE!
Mismatch- I'm antisocial and died from osteoporosis.
The early bird gets the tree.
Hey there, I've got a skeleton key you can borrow.
You can't pick your family!
I said I was buried in work. I didn't mean it literaly!
Democracy has been Trumped
And buried alive
I TOLD you it's a bare bones operation!!!
Just my luck...buried with a friendly nudist!
I’m sorry I’d rather we try and meet other people
One needs time to adjust
Can't I just rest in peace?
I thought the least I would get would be a welcome basket.
I accepted your friend request. That's as far as it goes.
No, you may NOT have the name of my tailor.
All I asked of the store clerk was, could she offer me an affordable layaway plan?
I hope that this is only a dream
I keep getting this haunting feeling that I knew you in a previous life
Hey! Gimmy some skin!
Yeah, but I don't want to lose as much weight as you; you're positively skeletal.
+"Wednesday's are for ribs at Marty's."
Has anyone ever told you that your knock knock jokes are getting old?
Hey, don't blame me, I told the funeral parlor you were allergic to those damn flowers!
Don’t ask.
Okay, okay, let me settle in a bit and then we'll 'do lunch.'
So what’s new up top. Is Trump still running things?
Could you keep it down over there, I'm trying to sleep!
Enough with the 'thinking outside of the box."
Being a celebrity is tough...even down here they won’t leave you alone!
...And they had told me romance was dead!
Hi, remember me?  You shot me in '02
Oh God ,can I ever get away from her?
Welcome.  You must be new here.
Once a necrophiliac, always a necrophiliac...
No, I'm not a Deadhead
Just what are you so cheery about?
Thanks, Zillow
Again I'm sorry!  I thought you liked tulips!
Thanks, but right now I need a little more time to not be me.
Can anybody tell me what the heck is going on?
What!?! No final eternal rest?
That's very kind of you but shouldn't we wait until the decomposition process takes hold?
Can I borrow your suit so I don't scare people when I come out
Give me a break; I just got here.
I didn’t know this was business casual
I said a wall, not a tunnel.
I'm your wife, Stupid!
I'm frozen but they just don't know it
Happy Deathday!
Stop me if you've heard this one.
There may be some lingering resentment.
The Baby Boomers are coming!
I told you those things would kill ya!
Dad! Is that you?
I’m sorry honey, no new wife for you.
Seriously, there's no dry cleaning service?
Really, why didn't you send me flowers anymore?
Proud American: " Hey Donald...remember me?"
Cut it out! You don't scare me anymore.
What kind of a diet do they put you on in this crazy place?
I should have never signed that prefuneral agreement.
Sorry, I’m an ass man.
Finally, no one around.  Let it RIP.
Hey! Can't a guy any privacy around here?
Hi Donald. See you in hell.
This is roomier than that stairwell in Port Authority, isn't it?
Weeds? Got a lovely fruit basket when I moved into my last neighborhood
That suit looks rotting on you!
Hey, give me some time to get comfortable.
Does this mean I still have to ‘love thy neighbor’ or do I get exempted from that now?
How long do I have to keep wearing this tie?
I can't believe I'm on The Dead Ed Sullivan Show!  "Hi Mom!"
I dunno.  I was thinking of just hanging here until after the mid-terms.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily  --  Life is but a dream.
How ironic. I was a mob boss and now my bff is Jimmy Hoffa
Nice to see you too Ethel, but put some clothes on before you catch your death.
Aw, come on, I didn’t ask for adjoining rooms!
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm not ready either, buddy.
There will be plenty of time to sleep when you're dead"...  HA
So what's the story with "till death do us part?"
What a coincidence...two guys with the same name buried next to each other.  What killed you, Rip?
It's a custom-fitted Brooks Bros. suit and I plan to be dug up in it.
I TOLD my wife that I didn’t need to wear a suit.
Hi! I'm Rudy, Your wife. Well Trump-Care didn't cover my embalming expenses.
Rest assured, the neighborhood is to die for.
Sorry to bother you neighbor, but do you have the time?
Hey, I only agreed to 'til do us part.
So let's continue where we left off at you last session.
How can you be that nosy without a nose?
Bob," they told me, "just preside over the special counsel for a few months, and you'll go down in history." Spending eternity next to Ken Starr? That's going down in irony
Hey, what about "Til death do us part"?!
bonne nuit
Hiya ! You must be new around here.
Enjoy Your First Halloween
G’day, mate - first time down under?
Why am I always seated with people of no substance?
Hiya. Got any cigs?
Hey pal, get a grip.  This is a RIP zone.
I really shouldn't have omitted the "till death do we part" line.
Gah! Somebody kill me!
No, I do NOT want to renew my subscription to The Watchtower.
I AM your last chance!
I'm just not as excited as you are for us to be neighbors.
Better late than never, though my preference would have been never.
I’m sorry it took me so long, but my thought was “better late than never. “
But they told me on hold that I was next in line.
Let me get this straight honey.. now that we're six feet under, no more headaches?
Look Dad, you really shouldn't be so happy to see me.
For the last time, I am not your baby's daddy!
I got here first, so I get the tree.
Rest in peace -- that's a joke!  Why did I ever agree to a family plot?
Thank you, thank you. For my next trick I'll need a volunteer.
Hey, the best part is all the weight you lose.
Like it or not, clothes do make the man.
Rest in peace -- that's a joke!  Why did I agree to family plot?
Hey, you made it early for once!
Relax. Your problems are over.
Jeez, I figured it would be hotter.
I don’t know -  why are you asking me anyway - I just got here!
You overdressed for the occasion.
It really is bare bones down here.
Darling, it gets more spacious with time.
Admit it. They’re regifted.
To be honest, I'm not happy to see you.
Hey buddy, at least you were buried with clothes on!
So much for 'til death do us part!
Welcome to the resistance.
Well I shoulda known, there's no rest for a New York City cab driver!
Hey! Easy pal! Once the tie rots, it's not so bad.
This will be an eternity
You'll rest more in peace once the maggots get here!
Will you please shut up?!  I'm trying to sleep.
Our vows only said till DEATH do us part.
Relax, honey. You’re going to be here for a while.
In my will when I sad I wanted to be buried with family, I didn't mean my mother-in-law.
Welcome to the graveyard of former Trump appointees.
Howdy neighbor
Okay already.  Before you died I told you a million times that I love you.  Now leave me alone.
I don't get many visitors.
Could have sworn I paid for the extra leg room
Give me a chance to settle in, Jane.
You're overwhelming me! I need to re-gain my de-composure
I wish now I had requested burial in a separate graveyard, Dear.
HELLo.  Think of it as the ultimate clothing optional resort
Even in death I can’t get any peace and quiet.
I know texting, not semaphore!
Where’s a body have to go to get a drink around here?
Talk about coincidence!  My last name is also Van Winkle.
Hellooo! Welc... Uh, so snobby. What a stiff...
I’m already seeing someone
'Great. They buried me next to Red Skelton'.
I'm sorry. I'm still uncomfortable around nudity.
No, I don't know what time it is. Who cares?
And here I thought the first level of hell would be a little deeper in the ground.
Can't a guy have a little peace and quiet down here?
Your stone doesn't do you justice.
You say I never bring you flowers, what does it matter where I got them.
Be quiet! Do you WANT to be dug up and staked through the heart?
Relax. Soon, it will be like looking in a mirror!
I thought Speed Dating was dead . . . not Speed Dating the dead.
As I am, soon you shall be.
Rest In Peace ..." Yeah, right
Welcome to the greatest weight-loss program in the history of the world!

And, no property taxes!
Lived long and prospered...Bones
Rest in peace,they said! How am I supposed to get any rest with this jerk talking all the time?
Everyone is so friendly during rigor mortis.
And which "Ex" are you?
I thought death would do us part...
Please, Nancy!  I only promised till death do us part.
And I thought we vowed 'til death  do us part''!
Cremation gets reincarnation, we get this
It isn't like Knopf.  The first two letters in 'chthonic' are silent.
I can't believe he's a Republican.
Hey! Hey! Got any gum?
Okay, you're nice. But who do I have to see to buy my way out of this situation?
But we can be together FOREVER!
Hi!  In a few months you'll look like me
Just give it time.
Yes dear, they were on sale. Yes dear, I forgot you were allergic to them...
Yea, hi. When do they come back and take your clothes?
This is deplorable.
Vladimir, you still didn't say that you loved me!
I thought this was a tanning booth !
Folks, I'll let my friend here speak to the efficacy of the "Cemetary Diet".
The outlook for afterlife diplomacy is grave.

Could you just please compose yourself!
I told you to stay in the closet!
Eternity next to my father-in-law?... Kill me again.
I agreed- "til death do us part!"
If I give you these flowers will you shut up about Trump?
This is why I wanted Marge to die first.
Ahoy there Mate, would you happen to have a sandwich in one of those pockets? I'm starved to death!
Hey buddy, can you keep it down?  The sign means Rest In Peace not Rant in Perpetuity!
Were you ready to die?"
"Ready to die! Man, I wasn't even ready to live!
Boy do I miss the edginess of the city. Even the corpses are  friendly down South!
It isn't you, it's me!
I thought the Welcome Committee would be wearing at least halos!
Even in the afterlife, I’m just out of your league!
Nope, I don't want to be part of Neighborhood Watch!
Is any body there?
I'm telling ya, I don't get no respect.  I tell my best jokes and the crowd is dead!
Not exactly the suit I wanted to be buried in- but I guess I'll make no bones about it.
I was wrong.  The past 12 years has been bliss.
Go back to bed, Mother.
I'm sorry you've had to wait so long for a neighbor to move in, but I'm not gay.
Even after death, only the creeps/weirdos hit on me?
What do you do for fun down here, play Charades?
Dolores, I might not be married but I'm still dead.
I'm playing dead, what's your excuse?
You have to stop and smell the roses.
Hell is being buried next to an aluminum siding salesman.
Good lord, Steve, what makes you think I'm suddenly going to be glad to see you?
Great, an entire life of unwanted chatter and they bury me next to the overly talkative nudist
Stop, stop, I have heard that joke before.
I thought it meant Rise If Possible!
WTF!
I hate this bare bones reality.
Alright, already, enough about how there's always a catch when the Genie grants you your wish!
I can't get over how good you look
Nice try! But I’m still upset!
I see you have kept your figure
A year and a half of Trump I can’t even get a little rest here buddy?!
I know you took them from my grave to start with.
Hey roomie!
Hi stranger!  New in town?
Relax, buddy. And take off that suit and tie. You're gonna be here for a while.
Just ate a lot of cured meats, I guess.
Hey Jimmy, looks like we've got ourselves a live one here!
It’s too soon, it’s just too soon!
Listen pal, I can't help it if my coffin doesn't conform with the co-op regulations.
I told you that I had a flesh eating disease.
Now I get respect?
Be quiet - I’m trying to sleep here.
No surprise, I've always come prematurely
Hi. Can’t wait to hear how you died.
Hey pal, got any smokes?
WHEN YOU BECOME SKELETON ALL RELATIVES WILL LOOK ALIKE
What is it about 'until death do you part' and  'R.I.P.' you don't understand?
Why did they bury you naked?
Happy death day! Got cake?
Hey! Hey! Do you have one of those iPhone paperclip things for getting the sim card out?"
Can't I get some peace and quiet anywhere?!
When Stephen asked me to take over his graveyard shift, I thought he meant something else.
What can I tell you, buddy? Real Estate in NYC is a competitive business.
If I"m lying, I'm dying!
No. We knew analysis takes time.
I know, right? It’s the only place anyone can afford with the skyrocketing rent costs.
Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em..
Look, I'm new to this. Can we take it slow at first?
Hey Lurch, is that you?!  You may remember me. I played "Thing" on The Addams Family!
I won't start dating again until I lose some weight.
Put some clothes on or I'll have to report you to the HOA
I get it, I get it: you were buried prematurely. Womp, womp.
I guess I still have a thing for older women.
Oh No! I forgot  I still had a plot next to the Ex!
Why? Why did I have to be buried to my ex-wife?!
And they say people in New York never get to know their neighbors!
Lovely, but you should know I intend to play the field before settling down.
Hi! It’s Copeland from Accounting. Don’t you recognize me?
The salesman told me it was the most economical option in tiny houses.
I just look like George Clooney!
Jeez, You Again!!
Hi honey! Did you take out the garbage before you died?
...still with the nagging, Harriet? I never promised you a rose garden.
I thought I was moving to a diverse neighborhood but my neighbors are the whitest people I've ever met
My last words were ‘“see you in the next life”, not “buried with my ex-wife”.
Maybe in some other lifetime, sweetheart.
Jeez Louise!  ‘Till Death Do Us Part’’, ungrammatical as it may be, mean nothing to you?
Love at first sight
You never liked that suit anyway.
Oy vey! The plot thickens.
So is there anyone here from out of town?
I knew that dating site was creepy!
Its OK Donald. Hillary sends her love.
Thanks,but I'm a little down right now.
Being the liveliest in the group, Ron was finding it difficult to avoid the advances from the other corpses.

Hi, I was the United States.
Just send a snapchat like everyone else.
Come here often?
Helo, I’m from Microsoft Windows!
Hi neighbor, never thought I'd  see you again! Can I borrow a shovel?
Really? You hate the flowers? You said they where your favorite. I guess I will spend eternity hearing about it. I guess I am not resting peace?
Here I don’t need these anymore.
Finally... what took you so long!
I wasn't into bony people even when I was alive.
Swiping right won’t make me jump your bones.
I took him seriously, not literally.

Uncle Fred was even creepier when he was alive.

Seriously? Nosey neighbor, again?? This is HELL!
Oh oh! And didn't you hate it too when you wanted to talk to somebody on a really long flight and they pretended to be asleep?
I mean, really... Who wants to be born again?
I thought I’d get some peace and quiet.
Can’t I go ANYWHERE without being harassed by my fans?!?
I tried returning your emails but they never went through.
At the seance, they said YOU were going to visit ME.
All I said was I'll pay you when my horse comes in and I ended up here.
No, for the last time, I didn't  bilk you out of the money, you old bag of bones --  It is just company policy.
I told you before, you're dead to me!
Hey Buddy! How would you like to decompose without the aid of unsightly maggots and earthworms?
In case you didn't notice buddy, I "knew what I was doing" too.
Welcome! Is that a Bill Blass or a De La Renta?
Don't worry, it'll pass.
I have the best grave!  No other grave like mine!"
"Yoo hoo! Your dead and we don't care"
Hey there Bob! I thought it was obvious, but To clarify: I meant to say I "wouldn't" be buried next to you. Not I "would" be buried next to you.
So much for peace and quiet!
I now dub thee the scum of the earth!
You got to be kidding buddy if you think that's going to make me feel any better!
If I'da knowed it was clothing optional I'da gone ta Forest Lawn!
I was very clear. In lieu of flowers, send donations to Uncle Mort’s foundation. Ok? Is that too complicated?
I specifically requested a private room.
Hey, remember me?
Sorry, I'm bad at faces.
I'd love to shake, rattle, and roll with you, baby.  Just give me a month to change into something more comfortable.
Oh great!  I'm buried next to a groupie.  I think I'm going to die.
Do I still love her? It remains to be seen.
It’s really nothing. Just a little welcome to the neighborhood.
Where's the damn string for the bell?!
Hi!  You must be new here.
Hey, take your suit off. You’re going to be here a while.
You're too old  for me.
And I thought I had hit rock bottom with my divorce.
I’m sorry but you don’t look like the John that I knew.
I mean, who wouldn't choose to wait for the rapture?
Mom, it was embarrassing enough when I went off to kindergarten, but departing down the River Styx???
It gets better!
Your welcome makes it all worthwhile.
Welcome, but it seems that your right arm was put on backwards and they’ll get away with it!
Sorry, but no, I don't need a 'really good' set of encyclopedias.
I was promised a 'do us part' !
Shut-up or I'll kill you!
Stop with the campaign speech ,what part of rest in peace don’t you understand .
I said I wanted to be cremated!
Did you tell them you're not ready?
I said 'closed casket' but did she ever listen to me?
Oh great. I always get seated next to the nobodies.
How can I rest I peace when buried next to my mother-in-law?
Please stop soft-tissue-splaining.
Hey, keep it down over there! We are supposed to be resting in peace!

So I ‘m late. Let’s not get off to a bad start here.
I wish I had been cremated.
The obituary clearly said no flowers

Thanks, but I have nothing to put them in.
THEN my analyst said...
Aww, come on! I always get stuck with the worst neighbors!

I paid extra for no solicitations throughout eternity.
I'm not dead, yet.

Thanks, but I had no intention on moving in this soon.
Bro," he said, "I'm not going out like everyone else. I'm going to live a life of adventure. Sadly I died without finding what happened to him.
I told you I wouldn't wait forever
I guess I didn't hide all my skeletons in the closet and that I'm going to Hell in a casket.
Welcome to the neighborhood!
Hi, clothes are optional here!
Let me tell ya, this whole afterlife thing, it's gonna be huge!
My loving wife never told me what happened to her first husband.
This is so unsuitable. I was a blue jeans kind of guy.
Hey.., trying to get some rest here!
You’re not helping me make death great again!
Where is my agent?! I don't work with old people!
Which part of rest in peace do you not get?
I think it's too soon...
I’m sticking to “til death do us part”, not “now and forever”.
Make no bones about it, this coffin way too small.
Look at this cheap suit they put me in!
No worries, soon you will look like me.
Looks like “till death do us part” is going to take longer than you hoped for.
Hi Joe.  Didn't you know that 15 min could have saved you 15% or more on After Life Insurance?  

Don't be like Joe. Call GOD CO. Now
You new here?
Hey, Friday's are business casual!
'I had the #f* right-of-way?' 
That's all you got?
Are you flirting with the new guy?
Gee Honey, you’re looking well!
That suit will soon be swimming on you.
This is ridiculous, we really can't go back up from here?
No, I didn't bring any Vitamin D! What, you think I planned this?
Welcome! 7 Billion more and the earth will begin to heal!
Should have opted for cremation - that burial insurance really put me in the hole.
It was a rhetorical question
"Hey, remember the skeleton crew you never paid?"
Looks like they forgot to leave the coins for the Styx crossing for you too.
a trump what's up"
Hello!! It's casual Friday, bub.
Come on, you are supposed to be resting.
The Grave's a Fine and Quiet Place....Not
Try leaving well enough alone.
'Will you just let me rest in peace!"
These tombstones are false advertising...
Where can I hang this suit? It's killing me.
For the last time -- no, that casket doesn't make you look fat!
Just gimme the bare bones.
Hey! Will you please stop whining about the death of white male hegemony!
'What happened to death do us part?' he said to his nagging former wife.
No thank you. I'm on a liquids-only diet.
You're interupting the PEACE!
I think it's time you stop dieting.
Hey Bob! Hey Bob! BOB! Damn, that rigor mortis has really set in there.
My condolences to your family...
You're not Russian, are you?
Come on Bobby, this is why I moved out of the house."
We've reached death; can we part?
Sorry. I don't know what to tell you. Maybe fake it until you make it?
If you constantly wave like this, you'll stave off rigor mortis!
I know who you are, we bought these together.
You either feed your memorial guests sandwiches or get a coffin top they said.
She's a dead ringer for his ex-wife.
Oh, NOW you give them to me.
How come Styx and stones didn’t break your bones?
Stop Please! Your Killing Me!
Hi, I'm Nixon's presidency, pleased to meet you, Trump. Did you dig that yourself?
Relax! The first 20 days are the worst.
Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.
OK ! Now what happens?
I asked for a private burial!
They had to bury me next my insurance salesman.
Harry from Accounts says hello
R.I.P., Jeff! R.I.P!
Something tells me I’m overdressed!
Welcome to your death bed! I am your tour guide
Stop it. I got remarried twice since
What a RIP!
But honey, I thought it was only ’til death do us part.
Here's where you find your inner self.
You look like a lively one.
Howdy neighbor!  How can I make your stay more restful and peaceful?
This will be your first bad news story you can't reverse!
I was going to be cremated, but I'm afraid of fire
Why did a pay for the family plan?  What was I thinking? How was I supposed to know it included mother-in-laws?
Hello Eternal Neighbor. Hope you're not too claustrophobic.
Welcome! No, this can't be right!
Don't worry! I wouldn't dare because I am fully aware of #MeToo!
I just can’t tell if I’m coming or going!
Welcome. Yeah, we all thought we weren’t supposed to be here when we were new.
Darling, you know I love the time we spend together. I'm just not looking for something long term right now.
Who would have thought no one would come to my funeral?
Are you done yet?
Fine, I’ll give you credit for social X-ray but I need my white suit back
Why would I want the flowers back mom?!
Please Pass the Poupon.
'Okay, okay, I'm sorry I forgot to put roses on your grave
Wave if you can see me.
Even in death I can't get away from her?
Remember Larry,we always said 'til death do us part".
Of all the luck! I'm buried next to Larry who, since childhood, always had a creepy crush on me.
I told you hell was not full yet.
I forgot that you were allergic to roses. Sorry.
Some of us are trying to rest in peace, over here.
What can I say. It grows on you.
So much has changed in 15 years Helen. I'm not the same man and you?...well your all bones now, and I'm...not feeling it!
Can't you read?!
You know Harold, we could do a public service announcement "Always suit up before you jump her bones."
Okay, okay...leave me one of your tracts. Then leave me the hell alone.
Are you going to do 
that for the rest of eternity?
I thought it was just a Jeep thing.  This is gonna be hell.
R.I.P" RIP what? Paper, Fabric...?
How is it that Mr. Bones over there has more life than me?
And I asked to be cremated.
Don't try to get on my good side. I know you asked for separate coffins when you made the reservation.
Maybe it's time to slow down and smell the roses.
This afterlife sucks. Where's my beautiful, beautiful Sylvia?
Welcome to the neighborhood, I  was buried and rotted  here.
Let me tell you, my agent's been lying down on the job. "Hey, how'm I supposed do stand-up in here?"
The LongGoodbye
I’m sorry, I’m not ready to be social.
I know my policy didn't cover this suit. What do they think, I'm still made of money?
Would you PLEASE stop that! I'm trying to get some eternal rest.
Flowers ? Really ? Maybe next year some clothes for a birthday gift, whaddya think ?
What about the "till death do us part" business?
You might have tried ringing the bell rather than waving like that.
We're all pretty sore. But we try not to vent.
Oh great! He'll probably never stop talking.
Will you stop bragging about your tattoos? The past is the past, dude.
Anybody down here get satellite?
Hey Buddy, I know you're cold but can't you read the tombstone?
Don't worry - The freshman 15 is inevitable !
I'll never get away from my mother-in-law!
With that degenerate next-door,  I have a sinking feeling I am not going to get much rest and peace.
I guess you could say I’m a chatterbox.
Yeah, sure, gramps. It's just as great to see you again.
Oh great, I just want some peace and quiet.
hey sexy - u married?"

"just got divorced yesterday - not a good time...
Now, you've all met my next guest....
Well, at least I'll finally lose a few pounds.
Okay! Five syllables, I got it. How long does this game of charades of yours go on?
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE BORED!
Some cheapskate gave me plastic flowers. The same one must have 
given you that suit.
So, buddy, what's happened in politics since 2014?
Every move you make,
Every leg you break,

         "Every story you fake,
                 Till your last burned steak

"I'll be watching you.
It’ll be an eternity before I catch up with the Boneses.
This is it? I was really looking forward to eternal damnation.
Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, they decided to burry me next to "them, they, she/he."
Did I not meet the deadline?
Afraid to meet the new neighbor, because he had no guts.
As a fellow attorney, I'd suggest that you rest your case.
Can a handsome gentleman just rest in PEACE?!
I find  fresh flowers and a new lid help defeat this Industrial Modernist boxiness.
You again?! With the smile and the cheery waves!
Oh oh, let me say it -- "Puttin' on the Ritz!"
I can't catch a break!
Martha, I told you I'm busy.
So get this—I shit you not—GEORGE BURNS ends up buried next to me and I’m waving harder than the fucking Queen of England but he still can’t see me through the two coffins and all the dirt between us…and so yeah that’s how I dislocated my elbow, doc.
I'm sorry, but I'm bone tired and just want some rest.
You heard me wrong. I said "I'm so hungry I couldn't die"
Cheer up fella...it could be worse.
Hey, you're early!
Cheap kids!  I had no idea they would put me next to my ex-wife!
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO ROT?
I don't get it, the will specifically called for seersucker !
Groupies never die.
Everyone said I'll be better off dead, and so I tired it.
Why don't you go back to my closet where you belong!
Don't take it personally but I just ended a relationship.
I thought Limbo was a dance, too.
Hey,can't I just expect a little peace?
I thought she said go fly a CAT......
Hey Donny, it's your mother, make sure to wash behind your ears down here.
Can someone read the tombstone and confirm a gender?
Jesus,Earl.  Leave me alone.
I appreciate the offer: can you send them by instant burrowing?
It's alive, it's alive, it's alive!
For the last time, I have no WiFi.
Heaven or Hell, Judgement Day can't come soon enough.
Hey Rip!  My name is Rip
Now just lay you down to sleep.
I'm tired of your "bone direction" joke, dad.
When they told me I have a face only a mother could love, I definitely wasn’t expecting this.
You always did " kill " with that material in your act.
You must not have signed up for the American plan.
Hi neighbor!  Gee it's been a while since I've seen anyone.  What's been going on out there in the last 50 years?  Did they ever make anything useful out of computers?  Do people still make good rock and roll music?   How'd space travel ever pan out?
And just last week I thought all the goodbyes were a drag.
Right here, near my
grave, let’s hear it for
Red Skelton! Red..”
“God Bless and good
night, Ed.
My lean baby/She's so slim/Five feet seven/of Bones and Skin...
13 years of school, 4 years of college, 3 years of masters, and 15 years at the corporate office? I bet it was all worth it!
So this is where fired press secretaries go.
Okay, okay, so you’re killing it old school!
Okay, what if Company A only sold a DMO dental plan but carried extended eye care....
Buchanan?! Get out of here with that, this guy’s way worse! How long you been dead? Ahhh whatever. Least I don’t have to hear him any more.
Thanks for the warm greeting, but I want us to get ready for two jackasses from the New Yorker, David Remnick and the truly awful Amy Sorkin.
It doesn't end!!!
-"To make a long story short ..."
-"Why bother?"
Great, I'm stuck with a chatterbox until they build an apartment block.
No, no, let me finish, one minute I was translating, and the next thing I knew I was here!
Hey big boy.  Why don't you slip out of that skin and stay awhile?
Is yours rent controlled?
Welcome neighbor. Just so you know, the suit is the first thing to go.”

Mom! I am wearing a jacket!
I hear what you're saying. But, vampires never wave back.
And so I said, "I can't accept your apology until you accept me as an immortally self-absorbed wind bag."
Hi there friend! Look, who doesn't need some After-Life insurance.
''Have you read Lincoln in the Bardo?"
I just got here - I don't feel like doing the wave!
I still can't get a moment of peace.
Wow!, great embalming job.
Rest in Peace! Really???
How old would you be had you lived ?
It's not so bad.
Anyone got a cigarette?
Hey, “until death do us part”, that was all I signed up for!
We have a really big show tonight.
not even till death do us part, sheesh!
Dude. DUDE! Enough about this Meuller guy.
First draft: "The Waving Dead"
Welcome to the neighborhood, pal
I usually bake a cake for new neighbors, but I ran out of flour.
I'd rather be eaten by bugs.
Please, I just came here to get some peace and quiet.
He's still an annoying neighbor.
What part of  "I'm a ISFP personality" does he not understand?
Stop whining and decompose yourself.
But who would want to live to be a hundred?
I told them I was just a suit”
Is he waving goodbye or hello !
No, no, let me finish: it's simply not possible to be 'mansplained to death'.
Sigh, new neighbors are so friendly until they see my stuffed cat collection.
Enough," I said
Helsinki Summit
Damn, I'm still overweight!
Stop rattling your bones, and let me rest in peace.
Hi neighbor
Obamacare Death Squads..... Who'da thought it ?.....
Jimbo- It's me - Cousin Henry
I'll have to decline, I'm buried with work.
But her emails!
Don't fret.  It's just a matter of time.
Take my wife, PLEASE!
Yakkitty-yak, yakkitty -yak!... this endless talk is killin’ me
Is it against the law to like a good set of bones on a woman?
Does anyone question my dying loyalty?
Do I look like a guy in a Pixar film?
Yoo hoo, Jeffrey! It's Mr. Davies, your fourth grade teacher! Look how well you've done for yourself, even though you had such a hard time with fractions!
Howdy, freshman!
I dunno - maybe you're too skinny for me.
You're way overdressed...
How many times do we have to go through this? I am not trying to drag this case out.
Our relationship has never been worse than it is now, however that changed as of about four hours ago.
Trust me: After awhile it won't feel so cramped.
Look, I didn't know that skin was against the dress code here, okay?
You couldn't get rid me that easy Harry!
Who would have thought smoking six packs a day would kill me?
I know, I know, I know! You insulted Putin too.
Don't know, maybe it's the anti-aging creams.
Oh, now she decides to lose weight.
This sucks. They buried me in the wrong suit, and now I'm getting hit on by a skeleton.
Next time don't request Charity in lieu of Flowers.
So what if I remarried?
Welcome to the deadborhood!
They buried the wrong guy. I was still talking.
Flowers for my President
Peace?!
If you're waiting to be taken to a better place - trust me, you'll be waiting a while
Is this some sort of a joke?
I don't remember signing up for the "afterlife option" on that dating site.
It's a living!
Didn’t you ever read “Grave Expectations”?
I _told_ them I was allergic to those things!
All I did was click "Dowload Low"!
Where's the parting? I signed up for parting at death.
But everybody said I 'm nothing like my father!
That's a great suit!  The worms are gonna love it!
They promised ‘until death do us part’
Let me get in and settled first before we chat.
How do you like the new digs?  
(from Chris Berryman, La Canada, CA)
Nag, nag, nag!
I'd like to get settled before I make new friends.
Do you want these flowers back? I prefer chocolates.
No thanks. I always said, 'I'll sleep when I'm dead,'                                          
 and I'm sticking to it
This is just a skeleton of what I expected.
Words have consequences.  Especially in a medical directive.
It's just... I JUST felt the kiss of death and I don't think I'm ready to move on yet.
Hey there! Looking for a good tax shelter?
Even in death the insurance salesman is cold-calling me
Ah man, we vowed to part at death.
Hi! You must be the new neighbor!
What's shaken? You're still in costume.
This is NOT fake news
I hate to be the one to tell you, but I never did get my pizza order.
Hey,​ sexy! You're looking good, especially considering you haven't even started decomposing.
Hey! First day? Looks like you missed the memo about casual Friday!
Hey friend, wake up and smell the roses!
I was annoyed at first, too, that my casket doesn’t have a lid, but then I realized it makes it that much easier to stalk the earth haunting hapless victims.
Oh, she didn't know I remarried! What would happen when my new wife joins us here---?
Am I dead, or do you just have an extreme case of anorexia?
Buck up Matey, we're gonna stump the caption judges as much as readers are stumped by New Yorker cartoons and captions.
Could I bother you for a vase and some water?
Which one of our divorce attorneys screwed the paperwork up on this part of the property division?
Hey bro! Still remember me?
No, I don't want to come over and check out your upholstery.
So many activities! It's making my head spin.
I don't know any Juliet!
Hello neighbor!
You are not in Congress anymore.
Of course, I get seated next to the guy without any pants.
Hey buddy, you want to be my friend? I'll be your friend. Been dying here, if you know what I mean.
Come on that’s the first time I have seen a dead man offering more than one hand .  What are you? From out of space?
What was the weather like up there?
Ah nuts...still here! Seems like ‘Immortal Attraction’ would have been a less misleading film title...
peace" in our time
Look lady, give it a rest - besides the obvious age difference, I want a woman with a little meat on her bones....
Be a smug bastard. I've got cryogenics
Hey neighbor, don't despair. Trust the process.
I’m the one dressed up. Why is he so happy?
I'm a member of Congress  I was asleep at my desk, along with most of my pals, and suddenly . . .
Buddy just because I'm dead doesn't mean I wanna talk to you even though you're a fucking sick-ass skeleton.
This is like flying.  We used to have more space.
Man: Great, buried alive! I could have stopped this, I was and still am alive! Pathetic, only a moron dies this way.
Skeleton:  Hello, I can hear every word you're saying!
Even in death, I can't get away from you.
Louis, it’s mom. I’m so disappointed you won’t be coming with the children this weekend.
Sorry, man... I just got here myself.
This time flowers donyorker.com/cartoons/contest?mbid=nl_Humor%20071718&CNDID=43105533&spMailingID=1
Mildred, you know I'm allergic to flowers.  You'll be the death of me.
I know. I know. A corpse.
A REALLY BIG show tonight, including Skeets Mcgillicutty playing the bones!
You took my best, so why not take the rest.....BULLSHIT!!!
STOP! All I want is peace and quiet.
I don't have to take this.  This is my plot. Stop looking at me from afar and trying to engage in small talk or I am going to call the police.
Hey honey !
Wish I had known naked and open casket was an option!
I knew I’d take this romance to the grave...
Is it safe to come up now?
You're lucky.  You'll keep your nice suit.  I'm buried under a real clothes tree!
I'm not the only one who's flipped my lid.
I moved here for the peace and quiet. Instead, the chair of the garden committee wants me to help fertilize their tree.
Can't a guy get buried alive in peace anymore?
I’m taking tax fraud to a new level.”
“But who’s gonna dig you out?”
“The government, of course.
Gone, but not fuhgottenabout.
It happened so fast--I was at a Summit--where were you
It's time for you to bury your feelings for me!
Thank you, but I need at least a hundred years before another relationship.
No thanks, I'm going for zombie status.
Those are dead.
Have we met before?
How can anyone rest in peace with you rattling all them dry bones?
Now you offer me flowers!
Sorry I don't play Mah Jongg
Osteolibido.
Mom stop!  I can’t call my shrink from here
Whataya know? I still got it!
I'm not ready to do this full-time.
Good luck, I am still waiting for a callback from AirBnB customer service.
Like they say, "Better late than never."
You should’ve gone with the polyester.
Yoo hoo!  I'm dying for a cigarette!
Now I can finally Rest In Peace!
If I told you once, I've told you a thousand times – I don't need life insurance anymore!
Oh geeze, my agent didn't mention the annoying neighbor.
Ugh, you're chatty.
I'm supposed to be resting in peace and so are you.
I’m trying to rest in peace!
Howdy!  I'm Bones.  What's your handle?
Wait, I'm a newscaster.  The "other side" is after a commercial.
I thought I was suited for heaven.
Marley, is that you?
Proof life after death exists.
Well I still can't tell you even though I said I'd take it to the grave.
Well it's not great to see you again!
Thanks for the flowers, but I look good because they stuffed & dressed me, not you.
Hey new guy, welcome to the neighborhood
Yeah, I hear ya. Well, you might have been incel in life, but how about you start off death inskel?
"Welcome neighbor,  you're not gonna really need a jacket after 6 pm.
Finally, some me time.
Two stiffs walk into a bar. Ouch! Ouch!"  "Stop...you're killin me.
I told you I'm not here to make friends!
When you finally break through, come get me....
If only you let me bite your neck back in the day .....
I am president of the USA! They can't do this to me!
Look, this is what happens.
In suburban cemeteries,even death doesn't separate you from your neighbors.
You should take your clothes off now - they won’t fit for long.
The trick to staying alive is wanting to die.
Sorry. I'm late.
Well, there goes the neighborhood.
And, the weight loss is permanent.
Even here I can't lose weight-what's your secret ?
There are neighbors down here too?! I would kill to have that tree in MY yard.
Oh, hey! HEY!!! Welcome neighbor! I've been waiting for someone to move in! There's sooo much to catch up on if you have the time!
Sorry; my first wife was also the girl next door.
Boss knows there ‘s a plot alongside Tony, Sal and Paulie, and he puts me next to Liberace.  Mamma Mia!
Hey man, I don't date other corpses.
Hi Pal...Don't despair.  I tried to get recognition for my New Yorker caption submissions and never got a response either!
So I take it meal deliveries aren't reliable.
I’m an attorney and I’m not dead either. Who’s in on a clas action suit?
Here you go big spender. Welcome to purgatory!
Hello from the other side (Adele)
Keep them. They go great with your clavicle.
You are such a show-off.  Not everyone has decomposed yet.
This Corporate Mindfulness Training sis a bit macabre.
They’re not daisies but...
Go for it!!!
I like the way I look. George Zimmer guaranteed it.
Why do I always attract the skinny ones?
It took you a while but here's your bouquet back.
Sorry lady, I am just not into the whole cougar thing.
I’m not sure I’m ready for the welcome wagon quite yet.
Okay, okay, I know the tie doesn’t match.
I told the wife, It's not my fault.  Women love men in a suit
Bad news--you bought the farm without pre-approval from the bank
He made no bones about disliking chatty neighbors.

Hi, you must be new in ground.

Be mine, till decomposition do us part.
Long time no see. We need to get together more often.
Yak, yak, yak, put q lid on it.
They said this networking event wasn't as lively as others.
Our lawyer said we should bury everything...
Who else feels like it's dead down here?
Im sorry. I’m just not physically attracted to you.
Please! I need six more feet!
We're not on Facebook anymore, Harry.  Would you give it a rest already?
I’m not arguing with a has- bin
Why did I have to insist upon an open-casket burial, anyway?
I knew you were at that nude beach that day!
No .. No .. I'm not really dead..!!  I play a character on the "Young & the Restless" and I'll be back in a few weeks.
Your fifty minutes are up!!!!!!!!
In the end, "Dress for Success" didn't change things all that much for you, did it?
Hey son!  I told you that job would be the end of you.
You can have my flowers Mr President.  Somebody loves you!
Didn't quite catch that name, was it "Tex" or "Taxes"?
Stewart! I already told you not to knock before 9am!
No no.. i get it.. Stand up straight, facing downstage. Raise your arms above your head and clap once, then lunge to the left while facing forward and moving your head blah blah blah.. ...but.. Which One Is Michael?
But I thought I knew where the bodies were buried.

Over here, over here.
Now I know why they call it a R.I.P tide.
Why aren't you dead yet?
Omg-will you still love me when I'm gone?
Dave had that dream again.
I guess i had things mixed up. I always thought the open-casket thing was temporary and that the death-deal was the thing that was permanent.
I died before my time.

You must be a Democrat.
Wish you could have seen my hot dress!
Isn't this fun!
Quiet down over there!
Such small spaces, I can't even roll over.
Good Night, Jimmy!
Hello there, my son! Your boss fired you, isn't it?
You take ONE nap...
There was no mention of creepy neighbors. Alright, this is the last time I book on NoAirBnB.

GOD!  THIS is why I directed my attorney to bury me in my stretch limo.
Eh...Is it Caitlyn or Bruce?
Don't worry--you'll soon be in fashion.
Only my wife would dress me in my best suit!!?

I don't like the terms of this pre-lease.
I tried to swipe left!
what time is it
Come on man, stop moaning and take the hint.
The priest lied, he said "tell death due us part"
They all told me I was on a 'diet to die for' "
Boy this business is rough, I'm retelling ya... One minute I'm dying on the stage at Sir Yuks A lot next thing,  my audience is reduced to a conversation starved Shelly Winters...a lotta woman. Now she's skin and bones minus the skin!
Sheesh!
It's so nice of you to gift me with flowers, but I told you that you would lose the weight, all by yourself!
What took you so long?
I can't accept, my wife will kill me.
Oh, I didn't mean this nineteenth hole!
I guess that’s why they say: « live fast, die young and leave a good-looking corpse. »
Hi, I'm Edgar Allan Poe. What's your name?
For the last time, I don't want any life insurance...
Exactly, then I choked!
Hey, do you validate parking?
I’m just not ready for a commitment.
It's welcome to the underground.

These napping pods really are restorative, don’t you think?
Yes, I have lost weight, thank you.
Oh no!I get to spend eternity next to a liberal democrat!
Hey, welcome to the neighborhood.  Do you like monster trucks?  I do, Grave Digger is my favorite.
What did I do to deserve this? They put me next to my ex-wife.
Why'd I have to get buried next to that Great Aunt I met once?
Hi, I'm not into looks. I don't have eyeballs!
Hello, I'm trying to rest in peace here?
Calm down Debbie! Yes I see you waving.
No bones about it..it's cold without clothes!
Sick
No respect, I tell ya..
Aaaand they buried me next to Urkel.
Yes, I just moved in.
It's impossible to get a little peace and quiet these days
Can a guy get some Rest In Peace and quiet around here?!?
Howdy neighbor. So nice to see a fresh face.
Don’t interrupt; I’m not done!
The tombstones say RIP, rest in peace, so bug off!
Hey! Quit your complaining. You'll get used to it after awhile.
Ok.  So, it will be a little rougher on you with all the ants and termites!
Hey, I can't afford to lose that much weight.
Sure, it's easy for you to be happy -- You're rent-controlled!
I wish I had spent more time watching the Office.
Can't I die in peace?
I can't get peace & quiet ANYWHERE!
I’m so sick of all the crypt calling in this graveyard, just because I have flash everyone gets their bones rattling!!!
We have nudists here too.
I'm not really dead, I'm just avoiding the news.
No I won’t be your Valentine and those were my flowers in the first place!!
Please stop asking if you can knock the wall down.
The funeral home didn't tell  me about the bare-bones option!
Don't you tell me about a bone you have to pick with me,
I said ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t and they bury me for that?
Too rich, too thin, AND too safe?
Sorry man - can't help you. You're the one who wanted to be under the tree with those big roots.
As Fate would have it, an honest politician was finally found. Sadly, he was buried alive because honesty was unacceptable, except to his biggest fan who waited years to find such a man.
When you are dead and burried you gain the ability to see through dirt.
So . . . we're really on this Lazy River  forever?
How could I be here already? I’m only thirty-nine.
We're good right here .... no political discussions allowed.
It's a really long ride!
Trust me - I didn't even have to give up carbs.
Listen, I know you’ve spent your whole life here, and this is a great neighborhood, but I expected at least SOME light for the rent I’m paying!  And the WiFi?  Forget it!
Are you gonna talk me to , uh, what's after death?
Turf's up
Don't worry. This is the only diet guaranteed to work forever.
For anytime the moment is right
Don’t you think it’s a little late for “I’m sorry”?
No talking ! I know the rules. I've been here longer than you.
Rumored to be considering a reboot, Sullivan and Wences had this to say, “Tsaright, Tsaright.”
They're hand fashioned, yet bone dry... What took you so long?
Sorry, I don't date older women.
Didn't you read the headstone, man? Can't a guy actually rest in peace?
This is a grave situation, I could use some help.
Hey, hey, hey! Quiet down. This is Woodlawn. There are already enough gabby politicians here!
I won't be needing these!
Would you prefer the bottom bunk, then?
EVERYONE is right post hoc about term vs. whole life!
Of course I'm happy we're together again...said no one ever.
Oh great, I presume you have another deadline.
Yeah! This is a good place for the hide and seek contest. They’re still looking For me!
Hello from the other siiiide...
As one bonehead to another, glad to have aboard!

All I did was say I didnt like the World Cup and now my best friend is a skeleton
Please! Don't go!
Hey buddy what's your cell phone number?
If you say will power one more time, I'll scream
Your turn to go get the pizza.
Amor... E... Morte...
Sure, Love can transcend Death, but political outrage?
You can have these. When you've been down here as long as I have flowers don't hold the same meaning.
He's a corpse because he's dead. I like corpses that aren't dead.
Sorry,  I don't  play gin.
Hiya George!  Aren’t ya a bit overdressed?
Hey! Aren't you that guy from high school voted most likely to succeed?
I 'm not sure exactly why either, but I know we have always aged gracefully.
Hi!  Is there anything I can do to not look like you?
Because plastic is forever, honey.
It's a great place to lose weight.
Not again!
Grow something more than flowers , Sweetie.
Look, we’re bunkies and nothing more.
Sorry, thought you were sleeping.
Hey, look over here pal.I know it sucks but at least they fixed you up with a nice suit.
Hey there! You got what you deserved for voting for Trump.
I don't get it. They said "Until 120" so I took 120 vitamins a day -- and here I am.
Is that your best suit?  Big mistake.
Remarried three times, but I guess love really never dies.
Hey, dude. I hope that suit’s not polyester. We tend to go natural down here, if you know what I mean.
Hide and ghost-seek!
At least they dressed you.
Shove it, bonehead, I'm not feeling very neighborly right now.
High there Dude, I guess I'll see ya soon. RIP!
'Rest in Peace,'  come on, what does that mean, anyway?  Here we are, dead, I mean, what else are we going to do?  It's just some scam slogan by headstone salesmen.  Hey, are we just supposed to lie here and take it?  Man, I tell you...
This is one morbidly disgusting cartoon, isn't it?
what's with the clothes?
Finally, eternal rest.
Jesus, I wouldn’t have come if I knew how much you’ve let yourself go.
Welcome. The diet program here is marvelous.
You're still too fat.
Here, you need this more than I do.
Hi, Honey! I've been waiting up all night for you.
What part of "rest in peace" doesn't this guy get?
Here, there, everywhere....

Too shy to bare it all
no cable?
Hello. Welcome to the deep state.
Hey dude, Welcome. Here life is beautiful with no commitment.
You’re still very, very dead to me, Hillary.

Don't worry, the worms and the ants are on their way!
Just trying to be friendly to a newcomer.  I'd say "suit yourself" but I see you've already done that.
That's not what I call "resting in peace".
Hey! Guess how many fingers am I holding up?
I need a few more years to get the hang of this...
I'm sorry, Amanda, but I've moved on.
How appropriate - these flowers for you are as dead as you are.
Say, hiya  Irv -- haven't seen you since you were dying in the Catskills!
Oh God...Not again....I’m just gonna play dead
I was only following orders.
I've tried rolling over but can you please keep it quiet over there?
Hey, Buddy, Your Jokes Are Killing Over Here!
I'm afraid that there is nothing else I can do.  Life insurance of definitely off the table.

Hey, you call this "Peace"?
Raise your hand if you think I'm dead.
Hi, I'm the welcome wagon coffin - so you don't know how you got here?
I know, I know, darling -- I have to loose more weight.
What can I say?  I guess I've still got it!
You’re not listening to me.
I thought they'd come and get me by now.
Now you tell me
Where am I gonna get a vase?
Hey,bro you really got a sickeningly pale complexion. It actually makes me shiver,but in a good way.
But I thought you weren't supposed to have any dominion?

Sorry but I like to date around my own age or younger.
I don't need any flowers, this is a fake death.
Well, now I know why I should have insisted on a lid.
For the last time, Mildred. No it doesn't make you look fat.
So I said, 'Gloria, cremate me for God's sake' -- and now here I am with you -- forever.
What's with the handwaving bit? This isn't the Grand Canal, nor is it the vacation of my dreams.
Hey Harry, it's me, Matilda! Did you put out the trash before you left?
I don’t know. I’m new around here.
I'm the welcome wagon to  say welcome and  to keep your lawn area green.  We want to keep our property values here high.

You call this six feet under? And no lid? I'm suing these bastards. You in?
Why are there no lids on these coffins, and why are you waving at me?
I thought I left that in the closet!
Come on, let me borrow the suit or the skin, you don't need both.
Sure it is a dream, but we can still have some fun.
Good you found these great boats, only it's a little hard to see what's ahead for us.

Not to worry! It takes a while to learn the ropes,but clothes are optional.
Hey, welcome! Any chance they buried you with some Ice Breakers Cubes? It's the weirdest thing but since I got put down here I've just been DYING for some Ice Breakers Cubes. Hehe. 'Dying.' That's funny. I'm already dead. Gotta write that down.

Hey Newbee--Relax.  Remember when you were always praying for a nice long rest
Well,
Someone was listeming.
No thanks, I've stopped writing in my gratitude journal.
I moved here specifically so I WOULDN’T have to say good morning to my skeleton neighbors.

This is the last place I thought I would ever see you wearing that awful suit

Didn’t I see you at a BBQ last week?
I wore the same tie!
Are you OK in there?
What are the odds of ending up next to your stalker!?
This is clearly not the business class I opted for in my will.

Someone came to school with humans. Now we’ve all got them.
It didn’t really bother me until they discovered fire.
As a previous partner, I thought I’d let you know.
Ice didn't work, so I'm trying acupuncture.
Don't get too close, I have sapiens.
The doctor says they’ll be gone in a few million years.
Watch what happens when I sneeze.
So instead of spraying, you waited and they just killed each other?
We never had this problem with the gatherers.
My doctor said if you don’t get rid of them, they evolve into something much worse.
It's hard to believe we'll go extinct before these idiots.
I was skeptical too, but my lumbar pain? Almost gone.
This is priceless. They're arguing over who actually captured me.
It's not the heat, it's the humanity.
The bad news is, I got humans. The good news is, they tend to get rid of themselves.
They're just humans. How much harm could they possibly do?
Sometimes I yell ‘Oh, you got me!’ just to boost their spirits.
I need your help getting some people off my back."
The doctor calls it mandruff.
These little pricks are getting on my nerves
Lie down in caves, get up with cave men.
You should get tested, too.
Let me get this straight... 
WE die out and THEY end up ruling the world?
They said they'd paint a picture of me on the cave wall if I gave them a ride.
This human problem has reached mammoth proportions.
Can you believe I caught another case of nit-wits?
My doctor says only call if they develop fire.
I picked up seven - I wasn't sure how many the recipe called for.
They are driving me to the brink of extinction.
Looks like I got hominids again. God I hate summer.
Dinner's on me.
The planet is infested with them!
Ooooh, look at me. I've been captured!
I feel like I'm carrying around a lot of aggression.
Twice a week for one hour. I am telling you I have never felt better.
My therapist says I let people walk all over me.
I don't have the heart to tell them that it actually feels good.
Really, what harm could they possibly do?
The size of their brain will keep them from accomplishing anything important.
They're adorable... Watch what happens when I sneeze!
I met them at a Trump rally
It's a problem that's been evolving for some time.
The kids are calling them "pokey-men".
Mosquitoes and humans what was God thinking?
I must have picked them up in a motel.
It's great to be home.  I'm never staying at that motel again.
Honey, bring some matches and the tweezers...
They're my dinner -- I'm on something called the paleo diet.
They think they’re going to rule the earth someday! Over our dead bodies!!!
That's the beauty of it — they're acupuncturists AND appetizers.
I tell you, New York is crawling with these pests.
They call it hunting. I  call it acupuncture.
Ride-sharing. It is going to be big.
I'm pretty sure I got them from you.
Sorry, it's another invasive species.
I'm gonna wash these men right outa my hair.
I felt bad for them.  They're all that's left of Trump's base.
Imagine what it would be like if these idiots ran the world.
The Lice Age has begun.
And you known what's funny? They thought they were bringing ME home for dinner!
They’re undocumented but very reliable and hardworking.
Oddly, my shoulder pain is gone, and my chakras feel aligned.
It’s wonderfully symbiotic. They scratch my back and I eat them.
They can reach places I can't.
They really need a hobby. Maybe we can teach them to paint.
You know it's not the heat that gets me, it's the humanity.
Extinction is looking better and better.
Do we have any more of the special shampoo?
Once I named them, I just couldn't eat them..._
I have a human condition.
Men don't understand what it's like to have people constantly hitting on you.
Please mom... I promise I'll take care of them.
I don't care how it looks, my back hasn't felt this great in ages.
Worst yet, they keep singing Wooly Bully.
They get the spots I can't reach!
They may look harmless now, 
but just wait a few million years.
You got any Cro-Magnicide?
Breakfast will be ready in 2 shakes
I used to pooh-pooh it, too, but, I'm telling you - acupuncture really works.
Don't worry – they'll be attacking each other soon enough.
I knew I shouldn't have borrowed Harold's comb
I understand you can get rid of them by jumping into a tar pit.
For 300,000 years, life was pretty cool. Then global warming brought these pests north!
They looked bigger in the paintings.
They're hunter-botherers
I never even knew I was a "people" person.
What, where?”
Can you believe there will be twenty of them in the debate?
Look at it this way -- they won't last.
There's a lot more of them since the climate started changing.
You left the screen door open again.
Honey, where do we keep the Neanderthal repellant?
I’ve heard bathing in tar works.
Those little fellows will be the end of us all.
They’re nit pickers.
Well, I started with just the one piercing and then I just couldn't stop.
Someday they'll joke about this in The New Yorker.
It's called acupuncture and it relieves the stress of extinction.
I brought the snacks you like.
They’re gonna spin this in their history books—trust me.
I roll. You stomp
Imagine if these idiots run the world some day.
They're not really too annoying, except for when they try to bury their dead.
They pretend to hunt, and I pretend to pay attention.
These are hunters I gather.
Half of them think my back is flat.
No, not hemorrhoids, I said humanoids.
I rather enjoy the little pricks.
Deny it if you like, but eventually this is going to be a problem.
No worries. Eventually, they kill each other.
I thought they were cute at first too.
They really help to get in all of those hard to reach places.
Do you want to tell them about the Endangered Species Act, or should I?
Honey, where’s the Neander-off?
Problem is, we had another mild winter.
Call me crazy, but I think the bugs are getting smarter.
They're always the worst at dusk and the dawn of civilization.
Well, it's a little irritating  but they'll be gone long before you or me.
Don't worry.  I think they'll be extinct soon.
Quick, carve a picture.
They're great for itches my trunk can't reach.
The most annoying part is how they won’t shut up about their Paleo diet.
What's the worst that could happen?
Thats the last time I sleep in a cheap cave.
It’s no problem, they exterminate themselves.
I don't know what the hell is going on, but when it was colder we never had to deal with these buggers.
I've been tested - I swear.
Can we keep them?
Pachydermatologists
My daughter's school had an outbreak. I don't want to talk about it.
I know I should get rid of them, but they’re so darn cute.
They're here to decorate our cave.
The doctor says not to worry; they’re gatherers, not hunters.”
I liked it better when they just painted us.
They're driving me to extinction.
Hey Doc, does this constitute a pre-historic condition?
The meds were making me sleepy, so I'm trying something holistic.
I'm stuffed. Do you want the rest of these?
I wanted to show everyone I wasn't homophobic.
Be honest. Do they make me look fat?
I guess that makes me a hunter-gatherer gatherer.
So small.  So cute.  What harm could they possibly ever do?
Another outbreak of Neander-dander.
I'm trying to collect the whole set before they disappear.
Are you sure that mattress was new?
They're an invasive species.
I know it seems a little new-agey, but this acupuncture stuff really works!"
They won't be able to do anything; they're a committee.
I brought take-out
Ew. Mandruff.
I like to keep my enemies close.
What do you think?  How much longer before I just roll over?
I picked up some appetizers for us.
They followed me home.  Can I keep them?
To be honest, I admire their spirit: they’ve been hunting me all summer.
How the heck am I supposed to know if they're hunting or gathering?
Let's go down to the tarpits and find out if they can swim.
I’m trying acupuncture for my back pain.
I can't hurt them – they have pictures of us on their walls!
First it was mosquitos and now cave fleas. I hate summer.
Hey, what does tenderizing mean?
More like The Lice-Age, am I right?
If you don't catch it early, they really start to take over.
Turns out I've got cavemen. Should I sleep somewhere else?
At first it was simple backstabbing. Now it's a fight of mammoth proportions.
I can't go back to school until they're gone!
These things will be the death of me.
Honey, I shrank the neanderthals.
Am I imagining things, or have they started using tools?
...and I can't go back to school without a doctor's note saying they've been gone one week.
They’ve gone straight from cave art to Pointillism.
My doctor said to call if it progresses any further than the stone age.
We need to address the cavemen in the room.
Yeah, they're loud, but I get to use the HOV lane.
You'll never guess which of us goes extinct
We'd be in real trouble if they ever stopped squabbling and learned to work together.
My insurance won't pay for any other type of acupuncture.
I really think it’s time we talk about the men with spears in the room.
You see them, too??
We're going to have to chat with the landlord again.
I can't go out with hurlers in my hair!
Totally solves the flea problem. I plan on keeping them until they discover fire.
Hope the Paleo Diet craze ends soon.
They're not hunting me.  They're  my emotional support posse
The headaches have improved but the existential fears haven't gotten any better.
You have to try it; acupuncture changed my life.
Gotta get that screen door fixed.
They're fighting again,  aren't they?  Superior species my ass.
They call me 'Masta Don'
I should've gotten the vaccination.
I shampooed with Head & Soldiers
I forgot to wear my human collar.
They call it hunting, I call it grooming.
Did you give me cavemen?
I’m thinking a quick dip in the tar pit will get rid of these.
Apparently the best way to remove these things is by laying in a glacier for ten thousand years.
The Licemen Cometh
I think my husband is cheating on me.  I don't know how else I could have gotten humans.
They hunt. I gather.
...and we're the ones going extinct?!
I reckon a stop, drop and roll will do the trick.
Got these back scratchers on Amazon.
Why bother? I hear they're on the verge of extinction.
I don't think they're contagious.
The humans are all over this summer
It's still better than having Trump as president.
You know, in a way I'm kind of looking forward to extinction.
They're white, non-college educated voters from Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
I understand in Jersey the're much worse.
Sure it’s symbiotic now but I have a bad feeling about how this going to evolve.
They were fine until they invented fire.
We"re safe until they get guns
Mom, the school just sent me home
What is it? Do I have something in my teeth?
I've been re-thinking my commitment as a herbivore.
I miss when they just drew on the walls....
Next time, you answer the door.
I need a mastodontist.
One day, when our advanced age is gone, these little parasites will probably rule the world.
They’re a mammoth pain in my butt.
Someday they will evolve into Republicans and make me their mascot.
It was a Groupon.
What  brand of shampoo did you use to get rid of yours?
For a while there I thought the voices I was hearing were in my head.
I'm telling you, they'll be the death of us all.
Doc says two to three weeks and they'll turn on each other.
I got the idea watching little birds cleaning a crocodile’s mouth.
I slept in that cheap cave down in the valley last night, why?
Get the tweezers.
The glaciers retreat and these pests arrive.  For me, the next ice age can't come soon enough.
I was going to have them removed but my plan won't cover it.
And, dammit, I used the spray before I went out.
It’s not the heat, it’s that pesky humanity!
What do you mean I have cave lice?
Soooo much easier than rolling on the ground.
Don't worry--they're almost extinct.
When they quit feeling good, I simply roll over.
I was skeptical but my back hasn't felt this good in years.
Seven, yes. Magnificent, no.
Be honest. Did I get any on me?
Well, Edna, I sure didn't get them off of a toilet seat.
I must have picked them up coming through the tall grass.
The dinosaurs had it easy not having to deal with this
They call it Acupuncture and my back feels so much better.
At first I was concerned until I realized they were more interested in fighting with each other.
These guys are the best.  They do pest control and barefoot back massage at the same time.
It’s called acupuncture and it’s doing wonders for my chronic back pain.
They sent me home from camp
On the plus side, it’s nice to have men fight over me.
Can you recommend a good pachydermatologist?
Sure it's annoying, but they're on the endangered list so I put up with it.
You should get tested.
It’s the little things that bother me.
Acupuncturists.  You should try them.
Its called acupuncture, very new age.
They pop if you squeeze them.
I’m not worried. They’ll invent the wheel and move on.
For them, it’s a mammoth undertaking.
They're great for those hard-to-reach areas.
Honestly, I never really believed in acupuncture either, but all my friends said, “Oh, you’ve just got to give these guys a try.”
The doctor confirmed it was humans, but gave me a special shampoo.
It feels good and they get to keep what they find.
I’m not worried, as dumb as they are they’ll be extinct soon.
My back has felt so much better since I started acupuncture.
I"m going to wash these men right out of my hair.
They can't find the elephant in the room
The insurance only pays for two to get removed per visit.
I brought appetizers.
I think it's some issue about me being in the room.
Not only are they worse than mosquitoes, they're wearing my mother.
Little pricks!
It's called acupuncture and it did wonders for Ethel's sciatica.
Can I borrow your mandruff shampoo?
One time just for laughs, I screamed and fell to my knees.
The doctor said it is a case of 'Man.' It's terminal.
Should've checked the mattress
Hominits.
They're called vermen.
By the way, hunting season started today.
They're trying so hard and I don't have the heart to tell them that it actually feels good.
Let's go to the tarpits to see if they float
Look, I'm a hunter-gatherer.
Cute, aren't they. I mean, what harm could they do?
Do we have any more of that Neanderthal repellent?
I think they’re trying to kill me.  On a lighter note, my back pain is gone.
As long as they don’t evolve and multiply things should be fine
They're called Democrats. They're no threat as long as they're squabbling among themselves.
By the time they've finally worked out how stupid they are, I'll be long gone.
The doctor said to return if they invent fire.
I liked them better as neighbors when they were just gatherers
"No, they don't bother me right now, but I understand the long-term effects aren't that well understood yet..."
My insurance plan finally covers acupuncture.
If this keeps up I'm booking an appointment with a paleontologist.
…But no – Doug has to come to work, and now the whole office is infected.
A little more to the right.
Where'd you put the Neanderthal spray
I gotta get rid of them before they discover fire.
Mom always said they die off once the first good glacier hits.
The doctor said they are a new species of parasites.
I took the shortcut through Olduvai Gorge.
Quick!  Draw this on the wall!
I wore a condom" my ass
At first it was really annoying, but then my back pain went away...
Please explain how we are the ones that go extinct.
I couldn't find a flea collar in my size.
Retirement got boring and Uber needed the competition.
I would, but I'm vegan.
I have a mammoth itch!
I picked up dinner for us on the way home.
How bad is it, doc? Fleas? Ticks? Heretics?
The road to extinction is paved with that kind of apathy, Charles.
I think I have Neanderthals, doc.
Some folks say they're sentient, and it's cruel to kill them...
It's always the little guys that stab you in the back.
Last time we vacation in Lilliput.
It's a mammoth problem.
You change the sheets while I go roll around in the tar pit.
Are you going to ask how my day was?
It’s a new kind of parasite called Man.
People are so annoying.
You lie down with dogs, you get up with Neanderthals
Hey honey, what's the name of those birds the rhinos use?
I'm just going to wait until they go extinct.
I call it death by a thousand cuts.
Really?  An existential threat?  But they're so cute.
This is my favorite party snack because they come with their own toothpicks.
I have no idea why, but when they poke me, my knee pain goes away.
They're a bunch of little pricks!
Acupuncture, you said! That’s the last time I listen to you!
Two more and I’ll have the complete set.
I swear it isn't sexually transmitted!
There’s something I need to get off my back.
They're a delicious snack, but I think the toothpicks are just pretentious.
You know those cave drawings we've been seeing around?
I need to get this looked at before they start to spread.
They're woolly bullies.
Yet another anti-human-spray with empty promises.
I swear I've only been with you! I don't know where I picked these up!
Woolly bullies.
Honey, you forgot to shut the screen door again.
I hate human season. They absolutely eat me alive.
Say hello to my little friends.
At first I was skeptical but my back feels so much better.
I don’t have the heart to tell them it only tickles.
Everyone at school has them.
They say acupuncture helps with back pain.
Uber ride share, Its a living.
Not to worry, the next ice age will kill them all!
I brought the hors d'oeuvres
Cave mites.
It's called acupuncture and it's very progressive.
Ignore these guys. What harm can they do?
Best back scratch I've ever had.
The Ice Age can’t come soon enough, Doris.
After they get the fleas, I'll have them shine the tusks.
Where’s the mandruff shampoo?
They’re all just a bunch of backstabbers.
Nah, I’m not too bothered. They’ll be extinct in no time.
I keep my friends close and my enemies closer.
'Yes, they're annoying, but I can always find a place at the watering hole and I'm never asked over by the in-laws.
It's evolved into a particularly resistant strain.
Can you believe they will survive us?
Well, Norman, we just have to live with it. It's the lice age.
My mom's an anti-vaxxer.
They followed me home, Mom, can I keep em?
Maybe we should go in. They're really bad tonight.
They just want a ride over to La Brea.
I think I rolled in a pile of Cro Magnons.
A little to the right.
I'm starting to think they'll be the death of me.
Oh, don’t worry—a species this clueless will soon be extinct.
There's a new acupuncture clinic over in the east valley
I can't wait until these annoying little bastards are extinct.
I just scream, "Argh, you got me!" every so often, and they settle down.
Serves me right for putting Gulliver's Travels on their summer reading list.
I'll never forget the little people who got me here.
But Mom, they tickle me and they run around and sing and stuff. Can I keep them, please? Please?
For your information I only shared a towel with her.
You're right!  Acupuncture is helping!
The neanderthals are really biting today.
I need to change shampoos.
My kid picked them up at school and now the whole family has them.
Honey, I think I have humans.
'Parasites' is such an ugly word.  I think of them as my personal groomers.
I see the monkey on your back as evolved and multiplied
Becoming a ride-share was the worst decision of my very miserable life.
It’s embarrassing, I know! I contracted them during my summer trip to the Neander Valley.
Can I keep them, they're small and won't eat much and I'll take them for walks & clean up their litter box..!  Can I Ma, can I..?
I liked our neighbors more when they were just gatherers...
My doctor told me to inform all of my previous partners…
Do these Neanderthals make me look fat?
Oh, they’re just hitching a ride to the Trump rally.
Would you mind helping me bring in the groceries?
I really think it’s time they discover agriculture.”
After dinner they're going to draw me on the wall.
They’re supposed to help me quit smoking.
I admire their optimism
You should see the crew that does my nails.
The Doctor says they should be gone in 2-3 thousand years.
Once they discover protein, we could be in trouble.
Honey, can you get the fleanderthal spray?  These guys are killing me.
Where do we keep the hominid spray?
I gathered a nice bunch of hunters today.
I didn't believe in acupuncture either until I tried it
Do these make me look mammoth?
I'm sure it's nothing.
Don't worry. Global warming will get them, too
Well they do worry me, but I don't think they have much of a future.
Cave men?  Thank goodness! I was afraid it was psoriasis.
It's a symbiotic relationship. They get fresh meat, and I get to miss the Trump presidency.
You may want to get yourself checked.
Yes but I'm worried if I get rid of them they'll infect the whole planet.
They’re just a bunch of little pricks !
I found them on Amazon.
It probably goes without saying but you should get tested.
These pests will be the death of us.
They're lousy hunters but their paintings aren't bad.
I've got the seven spears itch.
I'm telling you, they're driving me to an early extinction.
They're so primitive and harmless. What can go wrong?
I wish someone would discover fire already so we could light that citronella candle.
CBD oil? Really
Doc gave me a special shampoo. Should be gone in a week.
Please Gary, the gender inclusive term is cave PEOPLE.
They scratch my back. I show them where the good water holes are.
Down...and a little to the left
Half of my kid's class has them.
It's lice AND men.
I wouldn't call it parasitic, it's really more you scratch my back and I won't step on you.
I thought we could use a little entertainment while the ice melts.
Don’t worry when winter comes they’ll die off.
Fresh hors d'oeuvres, as requested.
I sure hope this isn’t the same group working on the wheel.
My advice, never become a political symbol.
Nasty little creatures. I say we get rid of them now and prevent trouble down the line.
They're bad this time of year.
Best massage ever!
I know, I know, but they just seem to scratch me where I itch.
I'd kill them but they're cute and what harm could they possibly do?
I’m not judging you, but I didn’t have parasites when we met.
They were on sale.
Don't go outside without putting on repellent
Uber.
Can you check me for humans, please?
Right. And you have a herd of giant unicorns on yours.
It’s ok, they’re vegans
Yes it's a mammoth responsibility.
Oh them?
They’re with the IRS, it’s death by a thousand little cuts.
I don’t know what they are but my sciatica feels better.
Well they are not accurate and they don’t puncture.
Between the copays and my ridiculous deductible, I'm hoping they simply go away on their own.
One more and I’ll have the full set.
They said one of 7 dwarves is Grumpy, but they really all are."
A sort of tingling up and down my spine, Doc
A little Pleistocene psoriasis. And you?
The school nurse said I have to go home so it doesn't spread.
Yeah, I hired them to kill the fleas.
Oh Ralph, that looks like a really bad case of Neanderthal!
One of them lost a contact lens.
Don't worry. I'm sure they'll be extinct before we know it.
At first they tickled, but they're all organic and my posture's never been better
'Bit further down...Oh yeah that's the spot!"
These things are killing me.  Know where I can get some homicide?
Do you have any humanicide?
Some days I do get tired of all the nit-picking.
Time to dehumanize.
You were right, never pick up hitchhikers.
What can I say? Men are just more attracted to me.
She said she was clean.
Well how do you exfoliate?
Oh, just a bunch of pin pricks.  They're harmless.
Don't you just hate it when 'The Man' won't get off your back?
I think I'd prefer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
I’d rather have fleas, like everybody else.
I thought we'd eat in tonight.
Probably from the hotel mattress. But let's not get into that.
My doctor said it's just a matter of time -- come the summer, they'll all be down in Florida.
Okay, I admit it. I've been sleeping with Janice, and her cave has humans.
That's what I get for relying on herd immunity
Do they make me look fat?
And they think they have conquered us.
Are those homo erectus your're wearing, or are you just happy to see me?
Don't worry, they'll soon be extinct.
They call it acupuncture. You should try it.
It’s all fun and games ‘til I stop, drop, and roll.
We're so much more evolved than they are.
They are going to be the death of me.
The doctor called it "pachydermatitis".
Normally I'd tell them to stop, but they're scratching that one spot I just can't reach.
Apparently they also do interior painting.
I think I walked through a nest of something.
My wife thinks they look good on me.
Global warming is bringing them further north.
They're not hunters or gatherers, they're groomers.
Yes, the little pricks ARE becoming annoying!
We're here for our portrait.
I miss the dinosaurs.
It's when they start singing at night that's really annoying
Jeez, Louise, it happened again. Where's the neanderthal spray?
Just think, after they kill us off, they’re going to figure out a way to destroy the entire planet.
This is how their dependency on fossil fuels begins.
Just because I have Cavemen doesn’t mean I’m cheating on you, Eloise.
I don't care.  It feels good.
Remember when these didn't show up until late Spring?
Don't worry,they're just Neanderthals.
I just wish I could get everyone off my back.
I was skeptical at first too, but it’s really helped with my sciatica.
What doesn't kill you makes you extinct."
Luckily for me they haven't discovered fire yet.
I'm trying out the new nit removal crew.
You can't even take a nice walk in the bush anymore without picking up something.
It looks weird,but after a half-hour session,I feel reinvigorated.
Wanna try one? They stick in your teeth, but they come with their own toothpicks.
It's the endless chanting that finally gets to you.
Acupuncture is helping me to cope with my fear of extinction
I'm saving them for lunch.
I let them keep the fleas and whatever else they find.
I thought humans were done with the whole paleo diet thing.
It's called fashion, Linda
Hard to believe we’ll be extinct but these idiots will go on.
Can we talk about the white elephant in the room?
Spearmen is my favorite flavor.
The ride-share option has been really popular.
They're so cute when they're little.
Since that trip to Lascaux I can't get rid of them
The Doctor said to call once they make fire.
I don't have the heart to tell them they didn't discover a new planet.
I don’t think the mandruff shampoo is working.”
I’d be worried if they were more organized
I can't believe that we're the ones headed for extinction.
It seems there's more of them every year.
My feelings about them are evolving.
My doctor prescribed Neaderthalbegone.
One day, they’ll be the death of me.
We’ve got a Mammoth tick problem
Every one is staring at me, do I have something in my teeth?
I’m never booking on Cave.com again without checking the ratings first.
Do you see them this time, Harry?  I'm tellin' ya, either there are seven dwarfs on my back poking me with spears or I'm gonna start layin' off the hooch."
Do these Homo Sapiens make my ass look too big
They say down in Florida they get as big as your trunk.
In their mythology, all of this is taking place on the back of a giant turtle.
Its a good thing they are small and not too smart
Draw a picture — it’ll last longer.
I hope the acupuncture works.  My back is killing me.
These hunters are such a bunch of little pricks.
The flea collar was a total bust.
Hey Larry, do you have any Cave Man repellent?
They mistake forbearance for passivity
They are ornery little bastards, but they do help with the fleas.
The Ice Age can’t come soon enough”
My doctor says it's mandruff.
They forgot we dont forget.
And you're sure you never cheated on me?
A little irritating perhaps, but what could go wrong?
It's my week for the car pool.
I just found out that trampling someone’s village makes them a tad mad
It's okay, they spend most of their time fighting each other.
We need to face it, the little people will prevail
I wish they’d leave already. They’re driving me to extinction.
According to my pachydermatologist, I can either stand under a waterfall or just wait for evolution to take its course.
Did you use up all the Off spray again?
I guess they’re taking a break from drawing on the walls.
Go ahead and try one - they're delicious!
Yea, I keep them around to remind myself we are not the only ones headed for extinction.
The doctor said they should be gone in a few thousand years.
At least they stopped making fire.
It stings a little, but it's done wonders for my arthritis.
Can you tell if they're the bad kind?
My dermatologist says I'll only get rid of them when they become gatherers.
OK, I collected seven of them. Now get them to paint the walls.
Wait until you see the revisionist history.
They usually kill themselves off pretty quickly.
Last month it was a group of blind men touching me all over. Now this?
It's hard to believe, but WE will be the ones who go extinct.
How did you get rid of yours?
I'm stuck in the lice age.
They call it acupuncture but it’s more like a mammoth pain in the neck.
At first they were cute, but now I'm thinking of bringing in an exterminator.
Symbiotic relationship my ass.
You're looking at me like I have 8 heads.
Nothing seems to get rid of this mandruff.
They were all out of flea collars in my size.
At this rate, these guys will become extinct in no time.
It’s fatal, but the doc says it’s still in it’s early stages
They're biodegradable and come with a lifetime guarantee.
I'm telling you, their little feet do wonders on my shoulder tension.
To think that these idiots will beat us in Evolution roulette.
Now if they would all just move lower and to the left.
Head & Shoulders, Why?
We have a symbiotic relationship; they scratch my back and I fertilize their fields.
Just a few humans...what’s the worst that could happen?
Remember the good ol' days when we only had monkeys on our back?
These things are going to drive me extinct.
These little pests are going to drive us to extinction? You gotta be kidding!
What harm can they do with their tiny little brains?
Good news, honey--our HMO covers acupuncture.”
Luckily they are all vegans.
The fresh appetizers came with cocktail spears.
Remember when all they could do was swing from limb to limb?
I feel lousy
First it was the glacier, now 
this .
Why do they make us seem so much smaller in their paintings?
Would you like to try my new backscratcher?
It’s kind of like those pedicures with the fish
The politically correct term is "little hunters."
The worst part is that I really have to sneeze.
The dawn of allergy testing.
You STILL think this is a nice neighbourhood?
They're becoming a mammoth problem.
I tell ya, Pete, there are too many backstabbers out there.
They’re on a paleo diet.
These Neanderthals really get my dander up!
It’s no surprise they haven’t discovered the wheel yet.
You think fleas are bad?
I got half a dozen backscratchers on sale.
I wouldn'd mind so much if they weren't singing ABBA.
Got any Head and Shoulders?
This is what happens when you lie down with humans
Am I expected to tip all of them?"
My back is itchy. Do you see anything?
You told me they couldn't be sexually transmitted.
The've got a mammoth task in front of them
Some days I wish I were a carnivore.
Guess who's the new mascot for the Republican Party?
Thank God we live on Lilliput.
Not to worry.  They're just measuring for the cave paintings.
That’s the last time I buy acupuncture on Groupon.
My mandruff is out of control."
You don't need to say it, Larry. I should have listened to you and ordered the flea collar instead.
We got a raw deal on this cave -- it's infested with men.
They say they want to be symbiotes but a little voice inside keeps screaming, 'Stop, drop, and roll!'
I just can't get rid of them no matter what I do. I swear, in 10,000 years we'll all be in the grave but they'll still be here.
I have to give up this Uber gig.  I feel like I spend all day just listening to people argue.
Don't worry. There's no scientific proof that these things are even real.
The vet says I picked them up on my last trip.
My pachy-dermatologist prescribed acupuncture for my wooly skin.
I stepped on their first fire. I’d be mad too.
I'm collecting the whole set.
Mostly, they just fight with one another.
I always thought the diabetes would get me first.
Acupuncture is great! You should give it a try!
The pitcher and catcher fell off on the way over here.
They’re annoying, but word is they’ll be extinct soon.
All I know is, when you have an itchy back, there's nothing that works better.
This Uber gig is gonna kill me.
I know...you hate when I take work home.
I wish they'd just focus on cave paintings like the others.
Sadly, evolution selects for the ability to irritate
Yes, they are a bit annoying, but my back ache went away.
It's kinda like Climate change. It's not a big deal until there's too many.
‘My doctor says the next Ice Age might get rid of them.’
Just my luck, I'm pretty sure I ended up in the placebo group.
The one time I don't use protection...
Actually, I think they're kind of cute.
I think my homo simplex is flaring up again.
They say it's supposed to be therapeutic.
We have a deal.  I chase off the saber tooths, and they take care of the ticks.
The doctor recommended acupuncture.
After they’re done aerating my coat I’ll eat them.
Ever have one of those days where you feel the whole world is out to get you?
Don't they understand that the Ice Age is coming?  Humans never get climate change.
Only when I laugh.
I don't mind, as long as they don't invent fire.
Be careful, there's a whole nest of 'em down by the tar pits.
Pesky little critters, yes, but they should be extinct soon.
Tour group
They grow on you
I’ve been told they’re not contagious.
Hopefully none of them have West Nile.
It’s the latest craze at the studio; caveman yoga.
I thought we'd do take-home tonight.
Go to the bathroom in a cave one time, and suddenly you're the bad guy.
It's not fleas, it's worse...it's poly-ticks!
No, they're not outdoor men. They are cave men.
They told me they would have my back.
How are we the ones going extinct?
Doesn’t hurt much-it’s just a few tiny pricks.
These little parasites think they’re going to rule the world someday. Ha!
I think I picked them up at daycare
It is supposed to stimulate my collagen.
Do we still have those collars?
What? It's supposed to help with my migraines.
They're looking for the elephant in the room.
I find this more relaxing than hot yoga.
How can I get rid of these damn pricks ?
What side effects? They make my hair thick and shiny, and my back feels great!
Gentrification.
Have you noticed more parasites with the warming climate?
Damn, it's another homo sapien infestation.
They evolved from the monkeys on my back.
It doesn't really bother me. They're just a bunch of little pricks.
It's hard to believe that we'll be the ones that end up extinct.
Remember that tiny painting we saw? I told you it looked like me.
It's their team building day.
They told me to use a fine toothed comb.
Cute little creatures but their brain is too small to survive a harsh world.
Don't worry, soon they'll be extinct.
No one seems to have told them the only way to eat a mammoth is one bite at a time.
My doctor suggested I try acupuncture."
You know, I'm getting a little tired of being the only hunter-gatherer around here.
This acupuncture therapy works wonders.
I barely feel the prick, and it’s really helped my migraines.
Be careful, they’re contagious
Yes, I lost my flea collar.
I’m starting to itch, would you mind checking me for people?
My doctor said it’s a bad case of Neanderthals.
But they're so cute and it raises their self esteem if I let them feel like they're winning.
I guess it's time to roll over and play dead again.
When the itching stops, I  just roll over and presto!, no charge...
Best of all, Medicare covers it!
This UBER side gig really isn't paying off like I hoped.
My dermatologist said it should clear up on its own.
These guys? Destroy the planet? Come on.
Yeah there was an outbreak at Timmy's preschool.
Mastadandruff.
Oh yeah, that’s the spot.
What do I care anyway? I'm going extinct.
You have to suffer for fashion.
It's been rough. Everyone wants a piece of me.
I'm gonna roll over and let them play dead for a change.
I don't have the heart to tell them they don't exist yet.
Barry suggested acupuncture.
I can’t seem to shake this off
I decided to do take out. You okay with that?
Don't even ask, Susan...
The back pain is easing ....but do you have any ideal what the bill is for 7 acupuncturists?
Mom, can I keep them if I promise to take care of them?
Great snack! They brought toothpicks!
I'm trying to get them to scratch that spot that drives me nuts.
They’re Democrats.
We’re going extinct and these idiots survive?
I'm not sure about this acupuncture thing.
In my experience, there’s no need for special shampoos. Just wait a bit. They’ll kill each other off on their own.
Extinction actually sounds good right now.
Hey, before we eat them, what do you say we paint some cute pictures of them on the wall?
Can you help me get rid of those pricks?
Okay, okay, taking a shortcut through Lilliput wasn't such a great idea.
If  that kid brings lice home one more time.......
It can be annoying but once in a while they scratch just that right spot!
If we draw an image on the cave wall showing them killing us, we could set back the science of anthropology for eons.
I know. They're bad this year.
They’re called, “humans.” They seem harmless.
They used to be cute until they invented those little spears.
I used to sit around hurting just like you before I discovered acupuncture
They take care of whatever itches and just a little water washes them right out.
I’m their whole world
Its hard to imagine that they survive us.
No more backaches since I started getting acupuncture.
Just wait until they find out how much our tusks are worth.
I don't think acupuncture will solve our endangerment.
I picked it up in a cave, it usually kills itself off before it's a problem.
The appetizers are ready.
They get the parts where I can't scratch.
I know, right? But you gotta admire their ambition.
I preferred the blind men.
I'm going Paleo.
This Uber gig not only brings me extra cash but also helps defoliate my hide.
They’re called “no-see-ems”, but you can see ‘em, right Honey?
This new rideshare gig is killing me.
Then I mentioned something about climate change, and all hell broke loose.
I can't wait until these little things are extinct.
On the plus side, my back pain is totally cured!
I can see the writing on the wall...
Get them some paint brushes.
They're a subspecies and won't amount to much unless the temperature picks up."
It takes a village.
I lost my flee collar!
I think it’s helping my back pain.
I can't believe I'm saying this but I miss the monkeys on my back.
I say we give them our invention of fire and the wheel, then I'm sure we can live on in peaceful coexistence.
They’re foraging”
I forgot to spray before I went out.
The doctor said it should clear up by the next ice age.
Can we keep 'em Dad? Pleeeaase?
Sure, they're pests, but we'll be here long after they're gone!
I think I have an idea for a new cave painting.
I travel with my own security.
It’s supposed to release tension
Later in the primary season there will be fewer of them, but their jabs will be more painful
Maybe I should eat more garlic.
I guarantee, someday humans will talk about the elephant in the room.
I know they are cute, but if you don't get rid of them, they will get rid of us.
Just you wait until it's your turn to be the elephant in the room.
They called Uber, but were happy to get a Lyft.
I have no idea, but I'm getting a great back scratch.
These guys are a mammoth pain!
I call it "Ride Sharing".
I took the shortcut through the long grass again.
Don't you just hate mankind?
Look, I just got home. I don't need you on my back too.
Wait till you see the vegans.
Well Joe, it's a symbiotic relationship that should insure our survival long into the future.
Why worry? In 10,000 years we'll be extinct and they'll evolve into fleas.
Just got our extinction notice. Looks like we're not getting our deposit back, either.
Nevertheless, they persist!
Only one survives the carnage and becomes their nominee.”
Oh, they just run around, yelling Impeach! Impeach!
Yeah, but they’re so tiny. What's the worst they can do?
They came with the coat
It's definitely some sort of infestation, but I don't think it's life threatening.
It's called acupuncture.  They say it works wonders.
I can't wait until they're extinct.
I hope they go extinct before we do.
Well, it all started when I ran into some guy named Gulliver.
I could shake them off and crush them into extinction -- but what's their role in the ecosystem?
You musn't let the little pricks get under your skin
I stopped using repellant. I just wasn't comfortable with all those chemicals.
On the up side the fleas are gone
And if I hear ‘This is a mammoth task’ once more, I swear....
I still worry that prehistory will be painted by the survivors.
My parents believed stomping Cro-Magnons caused autism.
My acupuncturist said to leave them on for a couple of years. Apparently, studies show they’re harmless.
They get to those hard-to-reach places.
It looks weird, I know--but that pain in my foot is gone.
Beats me.  They came charging out of a hole in the mountain yelling and screaming gibberish and climbed all over me.
I don't know if acupuncture works either, but what's the worst that can happen?
I do not recommend that new chiropractor.
You're so paranoid. What harm could theses cute little humany things do to anything?
I give them 10,000 years tops.
I was going to shake them off, but then I thought better of it, they will be extinct soon enough
That's funny, my knee feels much better.
Where do you want the appetizers?
Oh, I'm sure they'll go away on their own in a couple million years or so.
The victor gets to do my portrait.
Do you have anything to treat my hominits?"
Yes, I will admit that it was a mammoth undertaking.
The leader is a guy named Gulliver.
Honey, we have humans again. Call the exterminator.
Oh yeah, every spring. Great for the pores.
I have just one word for you, Jake: Acupuncture.
They are really just little pricks!
That citronella candle isn't doing a damn thing!
Climate change will wipe out these suckers eventually.
I haven't the heart to tell them.
Damned stylist didn't sterilize her equipment and now look at me.
Ever since the ice age ended these damned things have been all over the place!
I feel sorry for he little buggers, because how can such a small species survive in this world?
Sorry hun, I thought I purchased the couples massages.
My Doc said acupuncture might help my back pain.
Sorry , but the chimps do a far better job.
The acupuncturist gave me these to use at home.
They're annoying as hell. What we need is another ice age...that'll kill them off.
Its fun to watch their reaction when I do snow angels.
Do you ever get a stabbing pain in your back?
I was also skeptical about acupuncture at first.
Nit Pickers.
Cavemen season is so pesky.
It's less the sting than the annoying buzz in your ear.
The kids picked them up at school.
How'd I get 'em?  Slept a night at one those cheap cave motels in L.A. by the La Brea Tar Pits
I told you Skin-So-Soft doesn't work.
Ick, the warmer it gets the more of these things pop up.
It's like Uber, but, you know, for fleas.
Hey, better call pest control. We've got humans again...
They can scratch my back anytime!
They only get worse as the climate gets warmer.
When was the last time we had the cave fumigated?
Want to use your trunk or should I just roll over?
Hey,  squirt me, will you?"
They're kind of annoying, but they have some pretty funny jokes.
Well, I was told I won't get rid of them until the heat and humidity are gone.
I tried rolling in the mud but it only encouraged them.
At first I thought they were cute, but they never calm down.
My health insurance just started covering acupuncture.
Those large brains are not working for these guys!
Just like America's democracy, extinction by a thousand cuts.
Be honest—does this pack of hunters make me look fat?
They're benign, just a strain of vegans.
Could you please remind them it's 'Meatless Monday?'
Don't wear any of my hats.
The cure is worse than the fleas.
yeah, I work for Lyft now...these guys chose rideshare...
Some days I hate being vegan.
My vet studied Eastern Medicine.
I'm more worried about climate change.
Do you have any bug spray left?
You might want to get yourself tested.
It's called acupuncture, it really helps with my migraines.
Forgot to put on repellent today, and now look.
I must have picked them up in Tijuana
I know, they’re back, get the comb.
Am I getting mandruff again?
Why would I throw them off? They're hunting lice.
It kind of like having a monkey on your back, only worse.
Last week from the Home Shopping Network. The whole set was $9.99.
Yes, it was a good walk, and I picked up something on the way.
I thought I’d give acupuncture a shot.
I'm gonna order that pest collar from the Amazon.
I should have known better than to use the organic caveman repellent. It never works as well as the regular kind.
Why don't we cuddle anymore?
I’m letting them wipe themselves out.
Caveman acupuncture. It's the latest thing!
Don't worry. They'll be gone after winter.
Got DEET?
Actually, it feels pretty good.
Finally found the cavemen action figures little Johnny was asking for
Nothing to worry about.... just a bunch of little pricks.
There seems to be more of these things every year...
They're fighting over who gets me when I'm fossil fuel.
You said we could adopt
My doc recommended this “new age” treatment for my back
I think it's about time to change hair salons.
Don't worry, I'm sure they won't spread.
I'm sure they'll stop once they find out we're the last two of our species...
they seem harmless now, but wait 2 or 3 thousand years, and then you've got real problems
They're supposed to clean my fur, but all they do is fight"
-Should have called it Lice Age.
I finally remembered to bring home leftovers
It's called acupuncture. Apparently it's all the rage.
I got the part! I got the part!  I'm the lead in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!
Is there something in my hair?
They’re just action figures I glued on to get me through the Pliocene in one piece.
I thought they'd all gone extinct but I found a new species under my winter coat.
It's symbiotic: they scratch my back, I don't stomp them to death.
Don't worry, these aren't the kind that cause Lyme disease.
They're my wooley bullies.
They needed a ride, and who am I to say no?
I think I lost my man collar.
Doc says I have 'fleanderthals'.
I am not sure what is causing the itching,the Doctor called it Mandruff.
So they’ve got my back. Who’s got yours.
The doctor gave me a medicated shampoo and said we need to bomb the cave and spray the tundra.
Still think climate change is a hoax?
The spray didn't work.
I'm just glad they haven't invented  fire yet.
Amazon had these new back-scratchers.
Yes, but they think the world of me.
They are beginning to get under my skin!
I WILL try that shampoo.
'They're temporary pests - they'll never survive global cooling."
They call me Snow White.  I call them the seven dwarfs.
I know it looks funny, but ever since my acupuncturist was eaten by the Tyrannosaurus Rex it’s all I can do.
If they keep sticking me with those little pokies, somebody's going to be going extinct.
I shampoo three times a week and still can't get rid of them.
Well, that’s it. The doctor says I have humans.
Their words hurt the most...
They keep my wool from getting tangled
Honey... I think I’ve contracted humans...
Sorry I’m going to be late on my rent again Karen, I just feel like I’ve got a lot riding on my shoulders.
My acupuncturist recommended them as a supplement between treatments.
Forget the elephant, I’m the mammoth in the room.
Bad news babe, I have caveman lice again.
I invited a few of the guys over.
‘Mark, what is a “cootie”?’
I don’t like the way this is evolving.
The doctor says it's pygmies.
Oh that? Mandruff...it’s driving me to extinction!!
Somehow they’ve already invented racism
You said you'd feed them and take them for walks and brush their teeth! This is the last time Henry!!
How is it possible that we're the endangered ones?
Something called acupuncture.
"Getting these Neanderthals out of my hair is a mammoth task.
My acupuncturist prescribed them for me.
I say we just outlast them.
They itch.
So Ted, what do you know about squatters rights?
Mom put the medicine between my shoulder blades so they should start falling off soon.
They're on the Paleo diet.
I know. I know. You warned me about picking up hitchhikers.
It's worth the wait. They do a fabulous cut and comb out here.
How come the picnic is always on me?”
Not to worry,they are destined for extinction soon enough.
Thank God I got immunized this year.
I know, I know, never pick up hitchhikers.
Being so divisive, they ignore the elephant in the living room.
Doctor asked me to rate my pain 1-10. I said 7!
OMG. I am so over piercings.
Do you remember where we put the Cro-Magnon powder?
I liked it better when there were monkeys on my back.
They're annoying, but my joints feel amazing.
They'll never draw it like this.
I know it's crazy, but somehow the pain in my hip is gone."
I brought some friends home for dinner.
The doctor said it should clear up in a few hundred millennia
It's the perfect snack, toothpicks included.
You gotta try it. I’m tellin’ you the only thing that helps my mammoth headaches is acupuncture.
That's one small prick for the little men  and one giant prick for me.
This'd be a great opportunity, if we weren't herbivores.
Fannie, we are just too big to fail.
They’re Neanderthals, whaddya expect?
Artists!! They need inspiration before they will paint our cave.
hey Joe,you think we should tell them about the climate change thing?
Woolly mammoths go extinct? I don’t think so.
These are the artists I was telling you about
Did I mention I'm hosting the Olympics?
If hippos can use birds, I can use Neanderthals.
You ever get the feeling people are taking jabs at you behind your back?
I’ve got humans again.
I'm hopping they'll go extinct soon.
They’re cuter when they’re little.
Yeah, I got tested to be safe - but I am pretty sure I know what it is.
Pesky little bastards. There’s no way they will survive as a species.
I haven't had the heart to tell them that it doesn't hurt.
What happened to the guys you hired to clean between your toes?
I'm hosting a summit.
Honey, I thought they already sprayed for these.
Maybe I'm just paranoid, but it feels like they've been talking about me behind my back.
Don't worry, as soon as the weather gets extreme, they disappear.
I thought it was weird at first too, but when they hit the right spot, it’s just DIVINE!
How come these idiots get to survive the Ice Age?
I used to be able to get rid of them. I think they've evolved.
Why me? There' s more than one elephant in this room.
Yes, they are cute, but they have no future.
No . . . I haven't had a bath in months. Why do you ask?
I'm gonna wash Man right out of my hair.
They are so cute I adopted the whole litter.
I asked for a shampoo scented with Spearmint but got spearmen scent instead.
Now watch what happens when I roll over!
Wool itches.
I'm telling you Jean-Paul, acupuncture is fabulous for an existential crisis, you should totally try it.
The village had a free acupuncture special.
Eh, at least they keep the ticks off me.
I'm betting that this ride sharing concept has a future.
Apparently, we’re endangered, but I can’t see how.
Meet my groomers.
Yeah, I stopped to play with the neighbor kids. How'd you guess?
They convinced me it's more dignified than becoming extinct.
CBD wasn't helping so my doctor recommended I try acupuncture
Never walk under a ladder.
Yeah, they're a dance troupe from out west. They needed a practice space.
I wished they made a collar for these things."
I heard tobacco gets rid of them.
I Googled Amazon itch and they got here the next day.
The doctor says it's just a bad case of "the humans", and if it doesn't kill me, it'll only make me stronger.
They're so primitive.  We'll be here long after they're gone.
I really should've gotten vaccinated.
I call it.... acupuncture
It's OK. It's something they call "hunting".
I don't think they can do much harm.
The thing is, they have a point.
Would you mind running down to PetSmart and getting me some people powder?
They call themselves commuters and they are always complaining
Yet another invasive species.  Maybe they'll die off with a hard winter.
Well it started about 80 years ago so I went to my gynecologist. She recommended I get  a paleontologic examination. Then I was advised to get a mammoth reductive intervention (MRI). I was feeling extinct. In desperation I’m now trying axupuncture.
Don't worry about them.  They're just grad students researching why we're going extinct.
I’ve tried powders and flea spray but they seem harmless for now.
these dimwits will eventually destroy the whole planet.
They're picadors.  They think I'm a bull.
My doctor said not to bother with the ointment now that they've discovered religion.
Got them from a toilet seat...
Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones...
It pinches a tad, but my neck hasn't felt this good in ages.
I had a Groupon, thought I'd give them a try.
Yeah, pretty good. Yourself?
They've been arguing all the way home from the Flintstones.
I think they have a future. Don't you?
They say taking a tar pit bath gets rid of them.
Well, I guess that that's what happens when you check into a cheap hotel.
This acupuncture has done wonders to my back.
Know any place in Lilliput that sells hunter-gatherer repellent?
I’m so tired of being treated like a piece of meat
My skin’s microbiome seems to be going macro. That’s evolution for ya.
The last time "Paleo Diet" meant something.
Would you mind hosing me down?
Don't worry. They'll die from climate change, too.
I got a bad feeling about our new neighbors.
They're great at multi-tusking.
Oy Vey!  Flea Season!
It's just some of the Democratic candidates for President.
I'm afraid I need to re-home my humans- all they do is fight.
They're like fleas, only chewier.
Still more pleasant than the mosquitoes.
I hope they're not poisonous...
Don't worry, they will kill each other soon
The little buggers are starting to tick me off.
Feels good up there; as long as they don't discover my soft underbelly I am okay with them.
A couple of "roll overs" and they're usually gone for a couple of days.
You had some of these parasites once, how did you get rid of them?
I should just roll over and kill them but it actually feels kind of nice.
Would would you take a look at my back? I think I might have picked up fleas or something.
I know they look like fleas, but they keep screaming they are to be the Lords of the Universe.
Feels great! They scratch my itch and then I just hose them off.
A little lower and to the right...ah, that's it, right there, don't stop!
They're still there, aren't they?
They’re not as bad as ticks.
I'm betting they'll disappear once the weather changes.
I hired them to paint my portrait -- now we're haggling about the  price.
They got rid of my fleas but I can't bring myself to announce layoffs.
An Asian elephant told me this would help with my sciatica.
I swear, these things are some of the dumbest creatures on the planet.
They scratch my back, I scratch theirs.
I think they make me look modern.
I told them to get off my back but they just don’t listen.
I'm sure they'll be extinct soon.
Tuesday morning acupuncture appointment.
Annoying sure. It's not like the little suckers are going to take over the world.
It's not so bad, eventually they just kill themselves.
They fight, I get a message. It’s a win-win.
The hunting thing wasn't working out, so they went to acupuncture school.
Oh, yes. Acupuncture is just heaven!
I had a mammoth headache 'til they started working on my qi.
If this is the best they've got, they' will be extinct before you can say brontosaurus.
It’s a hoax...a nothingburger...we’re too big to fail...
We'll be extinct, and they'll still be fighting.
I'm beginning to have doubts about this exterminator service.
I think I’ll try a bath at the tar pits.
I don't believe in evolution.
Don't worry. This lot are about to go extinct.
Yeah they itch like crazy.  But it is the pre-linguistic grunting that really annoys you.
My plan covers acupuncture, so I thought I'd give it a go.
I'm just hoping they don't spread.
I'm not sure what's thicker - my hide or their skulls.
May I borrow your flea powder?
They're re-aligning my chakras.
I used to think acupuncture was a scam, too, but I swear my sciatica is gone.
Yesterday..I only had 4 of them..what gives?
The doctor said 'don't worry, it won't evolve to much.'

Thanks for the suggestion, this works a lot better than that awful shampoo.
Lice again.
I know they're parasites but I think we should respect all living creatures
Do I have anything in my teeth?
There's more of them than usual. Must be global warming.
Have you been seeing other mammoths?
These hunters and gatherers are going to be the death of me.
Could you please get these little pricks off of me .
I'll start worrying when they invent gunpowder.
This Uber pool is just not worth it anymore
They’re cheaper than the salon and they come to our cave!
Too bad we’re prehistoric.  This has the makings of a very compelling narrative.
Don't worry, we'll be here long after their extinct.
I liked it better when it was just a monkey on my back.

to roll over.

Oh man, I'm having second thoughts about becoming an Uber.
Bunch of Neanderthals.
Bit of a nuisance, yes.  But they can start a fire on a cold winter night.
Bloody humans!
Because I admire their optimism.
Sometimes it's unfortunate that we're vegans
Yeah, but you should see their 'Lysistrata.'
Oooo, Aaaah, Yeeeees, a little more the right, that's the spot!
I  know, I know...but they have big brains and can walk on two legs freeing up hands with opposable thumbs.  Think about it Dwayne.

I just ignore them.  They will disappear eventually.
I am not concerned, they will eventually die out.
The no-see-ums can be so pesky this time of year!
Ha! Go ahead and stab it with your steely knives. You just won't kill this beast!
I'm getting eaten alive out there.
It’s still the early stages.
Don't worry about humans, they'll never survive evolution.
They're fighting over me.
Tell me again how these idiots could ever screw up our lives.
Some day these pests will be ruling the world.

The acupuncture seems to be working.
I'm experimenting with community-based acupuncture.

My acupuncturist joined a group practice.
I’m starting to question what’s in my probiotic supplement.
They're a sure sign of Global Warming.
Sure they are cute now, but I can see them becoming a real problem if they keep doubling in numbers every twenty years.
I told them to back off
These guys are working overtime and they don't even know it.
I've never had dandruff like this before.
So I said to them, 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.'
Stay back! it might be catching.
Oh they’re aggravating, but they do control the fleas
Not all of us can afford acupuncture, Mike.
I don’t know. They said something about symbiosis

I refuse to let these become the dominant species.
You were right. Lilliput is a hoot!

The doc says I'm Patient Zero for a new plague.
Well, they kind of grow on you after a while.
I miss the “gathering” days.
Nah, it's just a comb over.
It's evidently called acupuncture...
Don’t worry—I’m gonna wash that Neanderthal right out of my hair.
I used to take flea meds, but I've decided to go organic.
They are cute,  but they itch

I told them " Sorry, but you only get down off a duck."
They refused to allow my emotional support animals on board.
They tell me they’re trying to start a new geologic era. Isn’t that cute?

Talk about making a mole hill out of a mountain!
I don't know dear, they're always on my back about something.

I was thinking about calling it Uber.
They are a bunch of real pricks!

yeah, they're messy, they smell bad and they get into everything but I promise to clean up after them. Can i keep them? can I, please?
They made me come home from school because the little buggers are crawling all over my fur.

I think I am suffering from Mandruff!
I was having a picnic with Barb when hundreds of these things just showed up. Ruined the picnic.

They call it group acupuncture and it’s covered under my plan.
Their a great massage until they build a fire.
I tried some new cologne today. I didn't get the reaction I was looking for.

Wanna buy a back-scratcher?
Sure, use up the last can of Off without telling me. Nice going.

Good gawd ... these millennials.
In the future....they will
be yellow and called minions
It’s called acupuncture and it’s amazing.
I've told them 'draw the pictures on the walls; they'll last longer' but you know...Sapiens."

oh an occasional deep wound but they are very effective against ticks.
They call themselves Homo erectus, and want me to represent what they call 'their party.'"
You better get that checked before it turns into something serious.
I think they're trying to describe me.
It's a synergism.  After they eat fleas, I eat them.
They asked for a ride to the battlefield. Who am I to deny them
They said they're gatherers, probably just hair samples.
Please tell me you packed the repellant like I asked?
A little bit of lavender shampoo and they'll be gone by morning.

I'm in a clinical trial for a new flea medicine.
My hunter repellent is working.
It's supposed to help with my lower back pain.

You DID suggest acupuncture. She was busy so she subcontracted it.
You said you were tested.

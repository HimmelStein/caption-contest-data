My conditioner said it would give me extra body, but I didn't expect it to be yours.
I 'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair.
Ok you can go down one more time but then you have to save me
It was a bob cut when you said, ‘I’ll be right back!’
If you can get up here, I'm hoping you'll take a look at the shower drain.
What part of "Get out of my hair" don't you understand?
If I had wanted you to come up, I would have braided my hair.
I admit it’s no beanstalk, but then again, you’re no Jack.

Just let your hair down", you said. Now, deal with it
Well you don't look like your profile picture either.
Wait till you see my armpits...
A one knight strand.
Wrong tower. I’m Rogainezel, not Rapunzel.
A braid’s easier for YOU, maybe.
I'd get out of there before the humidity picks up.
I’ve been using Head and Shoulders and Knees and Toes.
This is where we part.
Feel about for Sir Harold ... and the pizza guy.
I should never have gotten tangled up with you!
I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back tomorrow. I'm having a really bad hair day.
If you were on time it wouldn't be this long
Let's forget your fairytale fantasy. Use the stairs around back.

Oh, you meant metaphorically?
Any chance you brought a scrunchie?
This tower is protected by locks.
Sorry, too much conditioner.
It takes two to tangle.
Maybe I'm using too much conditioner.
Ok, it's down.  Now what?
If you find another man in there, I want you to know that you were my first choice.
Do you want me to send down your pants?
Pretend you're a salmon.
Would you prefer my sister, Alopecia?

Beans? You traded a ladder for magic beans?
Wait until he sees my chastity belt.
Great, I've always wanted a Bob.
My sister got a pixie cut and she's been trapped in her tower for years.
Leaving Sassoon?
This is not what I meant when I asked for a pageboy.

I don't need a brush with destiny.  Just a brush.
You must be looking for my sister. I’m Todd.
Or should I wear it up?
Because I’m worth it.
Be honest, it's my nose, isn't it?
Everyone lies on Tinder.
This is why I usually wear it up.
Okay, I let down my hair. Now what?
Now is probably not the best time to tell you I have lice, huh?
Okay, you can slide down through it one more time, but then you have to rescue me.
It seems I've let you down.
I said I like it when you run your FINGERS through my hair!
You better be a Prince.... these extensions aren't cheap!
I told you I'm high maintenance.
Fine then, go back to Princess Rebecca with the good hair.
You missed the hairpin turn!
Sorry, Security took away my scissors
You didn't think it would be a wig, and I didn't think you'd be ugly, so we're even.
Rapunzel's my little sister. I'm Niagra.
Sorry, I vowed to cut it when there's affordable healthcare in the United States.
I told you to wait until it dries.
Oh, I'm sorry, was my hair a let down?
Do you by any chance see the guy who came last week?
You're different than other guys. With you I feel I can just let my hair down.
Sorry, its my new  conditioner. No more tangles.
Sorry but my last Prince was Heads and Shoulders better than you
Should I get bangs?
No, I'm Ralph Punzel. Why do you ask?
What do you mean, 'Do I shave under my arms?'
Rapunzel!  Rapunzel! Lay off the Rogaine!!
After the witch laced her coffee with Rogaine,Rapunzel's situation went from hairy to downright Grimm.
Here's a teachable moment--go get a ladder.
It's over. I just want you out of my hair.
Don't take it so hard Vlad.  We're both getting on in years.
I won't forget how you used to get all the way up!"
I tried to tell you but no... “Let your hair down for once, why don’t you!”
So much for my terms and conditioners."
Sorry, I just conditioned.
Rapunzel is two towers down.
I’m her twin brother, Ralph.
The elevators aren’t working, you will have to use the hairs...
With you, I feel like I can let my hair down.

I shall suffer no entanglements.
Keep looking, I'm still missing 3 bobby pins!
I'm not cool with the mustache.
I’m not even looking for love, just someone to unclog my drain.
I’d style my hair in dreadlocks to give you a better grip but that would be cultural appropriation.
Mandruff.
A scrunchy, a scrunchy! My Kingdom for a scrunchy!
No, I said that you would have to deal with the locks. Plural.
I've been putting off making an appointment until I decide if I really want to commit to bangs.
Wow, that new shampoo really does add body.
What do you mean I'm high maintenance?
Of course the carpet matches the drapes!
This is pretty Grimm.
First you ask to see me, now you say I'm smothering you. You are exhausting, Richard.
Dude, the key is under the rock.
It's all down hair from here !
Sorry, wrong extension. Please try again.
Before you come up, find my scrunchie.
Now who's the damsel in dis tress?"
Robin Hood finds himself in the wrong fairy tale.
This never happened to Manbunzel.
Let your hair down is typically more of a metaphor than an actual directive.
Feeling a little stranded?
I gotta wash that man right outta my hair...
Haven’t cut my hair since Woodstock.
It's vintage hair. I haven't cut it since Woodstock.
It worked better in the story.
You think this is bad, you should see under the chastity belt.
Oh, what a tangled web is your weave!
Told you not to get tangled up with a hairess!
Blame the Grimm brothers. This was their hairbrained idea.
Wait until I lift my arms.
My hair has never had so much body.
Typical man. They beg for it, but they can't handle it.
Help,I'm stranded!
…and sometimes your hair lets you down.
I don't want to date social climbers, Cedric."
I'm the 'heir apparent' not the 'hair apparent' !
Three castles down.  Ask for Rapunzel.
Listen, you go back to that kingdom of yours and tell them that I need the barber, not a prince.
Do I leave you in or rinse you out?
It's a new fortifying conditioner.
Does this castle make my nose look big?
That's what you get when you don't read the story.
After your Viagra episode, you have no right to complain about my keratin treatment!
I'm conditioned to give men the slip.
I thought you loved my hair unconditionally!
Sorry... If I'd known you were coming I wouldn't have used conditioner.
How many times do I have to tell you to get out of my hair?
You'll never make it wearing those elf shoes.
Find the ring and then we'll talk.
Are you sure you want to come up?  My hair's a mess.
This sure is a grim hairy tale
Sorry, but I need a prince with more upper body strength.
Whoopsy, new conditioner
Do you see my hair clip
Who are you calling a "Man Trap"?
Watch out for the hairpin turn.
Sorry, but I'm really not ready to get tangled up in a relationship right now.

The pre-natal vitamins were your idea!
We are still working out the kinks.
We broke up but I can't seem to get him out of my hair.
Okay,yes,it is a permanent wave.
Go ask Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Snow White how they lived happily ever after.
I've been in hairy situations before, but this is the last strand!
Just so you know ahead of time, the carpet DOES match the drapes.
Would you mind checking for split ends while you're down there?
Ok, so I let it down. Now what?
Don't complain. At least you're not kept prisoner in a tower so poorly drawn that it doesn't have enough room for your head, let alone all this hair!
Not tonight. I'm washing my hair.
If you see a gray hair, I don’t want to know.
Twenty years of lather, rinse, repeat - you do the math!
But the bottle said it would “wash that man right out of my hair”...
Usually my complaints about getting tangled up with a woman are metaphorical.
I need a hairdresser, not a hero!
I never said I was easy.
Sir Reginald was sadly the first victim of 
 “Hair today, gone tomorrow “
If you can't get up here you can't cut it.
In case you’re wondering, the curtains do match the drapes.”
It's not the height. It's the humidity.
Would you please get out of my hair?
Might I suggest braids, my lady?
You do know there are stairs?
Climb up her hair, they said. It'll so romantic, they said.
Sorry, bad hair day.
As Barber College got more intense, so did his dreams.
Well if you’re not coming up, do you mind taking care of my split ends?
Are you the hairdresser ? Because you're 25 years late.
Oh, what a tangled web we weave...
I like to keep my men at hair's length.
The most difficult days were the humid ones.
Find your keys yet?
My hair was too short. Now it's too long. Make up your mind!
You're stuck, I'm stuck – maybe it's time we talk about our relationship.
I always want to put it up but everybody always asks me to let it down.

No, Juliet is three towers down.
I’m having a bad hair decade.
It's a new leave-me-alone conditioner.
My scrunchie down there anywhere?
I want you out of my hair.
I am so done with your ‘dumb blond’ jokes.
If you knew your fairy tales, you’d know this would end badly.
My hair always had body, but now it has a mind of its own.
Or is it better in a bun?
New conditioner."
Surrender, thief. I have you in a dreadlock.
I told you I would let you down easy
I said Seth Rogen, not send Rogaine
This is more of a let down than I expected.
Sorry, Dude, Rapunzel is in the next castle. This be the Hair Club for Knights.
When I said, “Let down your hair.” I meant loosen up!
You looked a lot different on e-Hairmony!
Well, you  better  go back in there and  find the  pizza or I am not  paying for  it.
Tress-passers will be flabbergasted.
Thank you, next.
Would you let me know if you see my car keys in there?
If you like it then you should have put a braid on it.
Absence makes the hair grow longer. 
Or something like that, I don’t get out much
Maybe just use the ladder.
Why don’t I come down to you?
Evidently "soft and manageable" also means "slippery."
Do you think the volumizing shampoo is too much?
So much for your hairbrained scheme.
No, they're not extensions.
I'm sorry I let you down.
See if you can find my dog in there.
You didn't mention this in your dating profile

I'm sorry, I just washed my hair and I can't do a thing with it.
Just a little off the sides, please.
I'll free you on one conditioner.
And yes, the carpet does match the drapes. In length and color.
It’s a presidential style.  Does it make my face look orange?
It's more effective than a wall.
This is England, you have to climb up the left side!
I said climb the stairs, not hairs.
Can you tell they’re extensions?
Ta Da, I have washed that man right out of my hair.
I never thought I'd get stranded like this.
You should see my toenails.
This Rogaine really really works!
I need fewer entanglements now that I have accepted life in the tower.
I didn't say I was under a spell, I said I use a lot of Prell!
I didn't mean "let you hair down " literally.
Watch out for the split ends
Why you should try again? Because I’m worth it!
Could you do me a favor and braid it on your way up?
You're leaving me stranded!
Greasy? And where am I suppose to get shampoo and water?
Next time you’ll think twice before you tell me to loosen up and let my hair down.
Of course you show up on my ‘Bad Hair’ day....!
Get ready. Next comes the leg hair.
That's nothing. You should see how I let my parents down.
For god's sake, Roger--get a grip!
I should have used less softener.
I feel our relationship has unraveled.
Yes, the curtain matches the drapes.

Rapunzel letting him down easy.
Is the buzzer broken again?”
A fool and her follicles are soon parted.
By the following day, the feathered cap was all the remained of the hapless prince.
Why yes, I am using a new conditioner.
What are you, an idiot? There's an elevator.
You never climbed the ropes in gym class, did you?"
Oh, dear! Now we both have split ends!
Maybe I used too much conditioner.
Sorry, I may have gone a little overboard on the conditioner.
It looked a lot more romantic in the movie
If you meant it metaphorically, you should have said so.
I'll let you go on one conditioner.
You're lucky. I have an appointment on Monday for a bob.
The team building exersizes are always the same at these corporate retreats.
Braids are easier for YOU.
You don’t want to get tangled up with a dame like me, Sam.
Hope we can get to the root of the problem.
Wait! Now I've lost my car keys.
It's a preexisting condition.
Sire? I'm singing in the mane... just singing in the mane...
Just be glad it’s not humid today.
Now you tell me 'let down your hair' is only an expression?
I' m sorry, but I'm leaving you for Sinead O'Connor.
While you’re at the store, pick me up a case of bobby pins.
I told you to use the stairs but, no, you have to do things the hard way."
I’d hate to see your bathtub drain.
Oh, you're still here?
It's over.  I'm getting a haircut.
Why don't you use the stairs?
I went and washed that man right out of my hair...
Well, you don't look like your illustration either.
TRESemmé, TRESemmé mucho...
More of a letdown than you expected?
Do you think my new conditioner is too greasy?
The worst part is brushing them out.
It's not you, it's the new conditioner I used.
Why don't you try using the door?
Right idea, wrong shoes.
Brother, this tale went from hairy to grim really fast.
What do you mean your name is Matt? So now I have a terrible Matt in my hair.
I’m just here to fix the clog...
Your "gone tomorrow" joke wasn't funny yesterday, Peter, and it's not funny today.
Comb on up!"
Well, be careful what you ask for.
I want to wash that man right out of my hair!
Wow... that was some  weed!
Love is a slippery slope.
It’s the humidity. I can’t do a thing with it.
Sorry I shouldn't have asked you to climb and carry Chinese food at the same time.
If you wanna go again, your second ride is half price.
Let me know if you find Prince charming in there, I haven't seen him for 2 weeks.
Why not take the stairs for a change?
This is not exactly what I had in mind when I asked you to 'let it all hang out.'
I’ll use less conditioner next time.
You need to be careful with those hairpin turns.
That’s not what ‘heir to the throne’ means.
Rapunzel awarded Border Control 
contract
Now whos the mane attraction!
Whew, I finally washed that man outta my hair
I need a week’s advance notice for braids.
Harry?
I told you to take the stairway, not the hairway.
I predict a split end
Father said I'd never catch a man with this hair.
Well, *you* try to get a barber to come up here.
Does this mean you can't fix the drain?
Take that for calling me Juliet.
Maybe you should buzz me in next time?
It's better than getting brushed off.
Now will you build me a higher tower?
Sorry, I've got soft water here.
Could you find me a stylist who makes tower calls?
I thought you had a shortcut!
My hairdresser says to wait two days before climbing.
I find myself once again caught in the cross hairs of love.
Climb, you idiot!
...and my name is not Rapunzel!
just wait till u see my pubes
Shall I let down the rest?
You think YOUR having a bad hair day?
I took off a couple feet and you didn’t even notice.
Careful, the first few steps are a little hairy.
Both my hair and I have been let down.
Don't you think you've taken this extension thing a bit too far?
Rapunzel quickly discovered that her conditioner was leaving an oily residue.
Great Scott! Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
Mother always told me, "long distance relationships can get pretty hairy".
On second thought ... try the stairs.
Someday, when this receives wan-smile-inducing captions from people who overestimate their own wit, perhaps a reader will point out that the thing at bottom left is probably a quill but at first glance looks like a cartoon fish skeleton.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Enough with the hair!
Sorry if this was a letdown.
Maybe you wouldn’t be in that mess if you’d shown up a bit sooner is all I’m saying.
Never buy ‘extra body’ conditioner from a witch.
You should've committed five years earlier.
I'll just come down.
When you're finally free, remember to send scissors.
This is not the story book ending I had in mind.
Well, you did say, 'Let down your hair!'
I told you never to mention that Rapunzel's name again!
Instead of buying me more Rogaine, why don't you spring for a taller ladder and some red wine?
Why don't I just lower my rope ladder instead?
Please tell me you’ve clipped your finger and toenails.
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, take the stairs ! !
It’s not you, It actually is me.
If you're really a barber,  just take a foot off the bottom."
Where is the mane entrance you speak of my lady
Help! I’m trapped in a Gustav Klimt painting!
What did you expect?  It has been growing since 1634.
Why don't you use the stairs like everyone else.
You asked for it, now deal with it.
I don’t think I wore the right shoes for this
Sorry I’m having a really bad hair day.
It's the humidity.
I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.
Maybe I'll just take the stairs.
I've been cooped up here since the '69 Woodstock Festival.
I'm sorry, I thought you were the judge from the Guiness book.
I switched conditioners...why?
Well this was quite a letdown.
This is the part of being a knight you don't read about.
Thanks for trying, but I'm swiping left.
It’s the Lock Tress monster!
You're confused?  How do you think I feel ... being a dude with this hair and living in a tower!
I said "send down the stairs"!
You SAID, "Let it all hang out!"
I should not have gone with the Extra Body shampoo.
I was told you desired a son and hair.
So, who's rescuing who here?
Sorry, but you don't fit the part
Sorry, I guess I used to much Dippity-do!
Silky-smooth has its drawbacks.
The stairs are around back.
It's been a while since I posted the ad.
Try braiding it first.
[singing] I'm gonna a wash that man right out of my hair!
I'm developing a musical that combines Hair and Grease
Yes, I can see it’s a big letdown.
Has it occurred to you that the stairs might be easier?
My kingdom for a brush.
Maybe next time, you'll ask for consent first.
He/Her/Hair
The Ultimate Letdown.
No, I'm her sister, Fuhgeddaboudit.
What do you mean you liked me better when I was unattainable?
Give me a week's notice next time and I'll have it braided.
Well then, grow a beanstalk! Figure it out!
Rapunzel?  No, my name is Methuselah.
I'll get out of your hair in a second.
I told you. I shouldn't have let my hair down.
Sorry, today was blow out day
I asked the salon if they could add a little wave to my hair and the next thing I knew ....
Why, yes, my hairdresser died twenty years ago. How did you know?
Honey, way too much conditioner...
This is a gender-fluid fairy tale.
Just an inch off the bottom?
I like it better combed out, don't you?
You can't just brush me away like this.
Only the strongest suitors make it through the split-ends.
I told you not to come on humid days.
Have you never used an extentions ladder?
This is why it's called "The Flat Iron Building."
Why don’t you go find your boys at the bar, and get out of my hair for awhile?
And there's more where that came from!
Well, my LAST suitor didn’t need footholds…”
Rapunzel? I'm Rogainzel.
So far, I am finding our relationship to be a giant let-down.
After you pick yourself free, would you mind tossing the comb back up?
It is I, Rogainzul.
Okay, smart guy, you guessed my name; now try my shoe size.
As your hairdresser may I suggest a taller tower.
Its our first date... Of course I used hairspray!
Maybe you should take the stairs.
Okay, Okay!! You were right about the rope.
While you're down there can you find my phone?
I think we may safely claim that our new Rogaine formula has exceeded our expectations.
Either find a different way up or get out of my hair
You should have taken up lock climbing instead of rock climbing.
My Rapunzello zip-line idea still sort of needs tweaking.
''Disappointment's a two-way street, fella. I don't see no white horse waiting!"
Rumplestiltskin!  Get out of my fairytale!
Never mind. Next.
Too much conditioner?
I told you this was a bad hair day.
Speaking of let down...
The bottle did say 'extra volume'
Or, you could just use the stairs like everyone else!
Oh, stop being such a drama queen. It’s just conditioner.
While you're down there, can you trim my split ends?
I don't get it. It worked for my sister.
It's not you, it's me.
This wasn't on your Tinder profile.
I think I found the needle
What a let-down!
‘‘Tis true. Nobody ever looks like their profile photo”
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your—Ow!
Get a grip, milord!
Can we re-schedule the rescue after my cut-and-curl on Tuesday?
Less complaining.  More braiding.  We have an 8oclock reservation.
I'm not sure that was worth two tickets.
Most of it's not mine -- I have cats.
Mostly it's coming from inside my ears.
I'm gender nonconforming.  You got a problem with that?
Just a little off the bottom, please.
If you think this is long you should see my fingernails.
Doth thou hast a scrunchie?
If you can't handle it unmade, you don't deserve it with a braid!
I've learned to let things go
Admit it. I'm too much woman for you.
A brush! A brush! My kingdom for a brush!
I told you—the whole climbing the hair thing only works in books.
And you should see the pubic hair
You want the next tower. I’m Harriett.
Golden stair ? I thought you said hair
You should see the shower
Don’t look so grim.  I told you my name is Rip Unzel, but nooo, you wouldn’t listen.
Just discovered conditioner. Sorry!
I’d help you but my nails are just as long.
Has it been that long?
Did you remember to bring the scissors?
Took you long enough.
Aren't you kind of old to still believe in fairy tales?
I’ve aged.  You’ve aged.  What’s the point!
I’m going to wash that man right out of my hair!
Rogaine for Women.  Why do you ask?
On second thought, Rapunzel, perhaps I will take the stairs!
Oh sorry, I just conditioned it.
How 'bout next time we try the braids.
Rapunzel! Rapunzel! I'm let down by your hair."
I’m not going to wear a ponytail just because it’s more ‘convenient‘.
Get a grip, Prince
Will you just get out of my hair?
What kind of golden shower were you expecting?
Oops, wrong tower. I’m looking for the girl with the long braid. Seen her?
Who'd you expect -Goldilocks?
The hair apparent to the throne.
I promise it's easier to climb once you get past the split ends.
Climb up or get out of my hair.
This is all very romantic, but you could just take the elevator, like the milkman
fuck you the real prison is contemporary beauty standards
Well it is a firm hold mousse
You're forty seven years late!
Braids would have been better.
I think you were right about going with braids.
I washed it last night and cant do a thing with it.
C'mon - it's not El Capitan!
Perhaps I need to cut back on the Rogaine.
Suddenly, the Prince found himself involved in yet another hairy situation.
I give you an A for effort but a C for the shoes.
Sorry, I can't do a thing with it!
I'm NOT Goldilocks, you fool!
Honestly, I’m not worth the effort.
No!  What I said was "bed down the mare!"
I thought you said your love was un-conditioner.
Good news, bad news Rapunzel.  Keep the hair growth potion but cut back on the conditioner.
And that is how Prince Harry got his name
YOU try taming this.
So who is this Rapunzel you are yelling about?
Does this make me look fat?
Sure the keys aren’t in your purse?
Oh, so I should be trapped in this tower and deprived of  hair conditioner too?
Dating was simpler back in the day.
Yeah, I can see how this wasn't the most realistic plan.
Next time I’ll use less conditioner.
That moment when you beseech the wrong prisoner and Manbunsel lets down his hair.
Sorry, I guess I should have used less conditioner
What a massive letdown!
Come back when you can snake a drain.
That was one hairy ride.
Should have swiped left!
I thought you said you liked knotty girls
I thought I'd washed you right out!
You're suppose to get lost in my eyes, not my hair!
One more wash and rinse should get him out.
Have you thought about moving to a water park?
I warned you about getting tangled up in it.
Do you think I am too old to wear my hair long?
My biotin supplements are working wonders with my hair!
Rapunzel's at the joust. I'm her brother, Roypunzel. Can I help you?
Where's a barrette when you need it?
I just washed my hair and can't do a thing with it.
Well, you told me to let my hair down!
How does thou plan to sweep me off my feet now, my lord?
Let me know if you see my last lover.
Perhaps now you will go get the ladder.
I meant it when I said to stop bothering me and get out of my hair!
It's because of global warming.
Probably not the best time to mention that I'm French
The ocean levels aren't the only thing affected by global warming.
Oily hair. It's our newest security feature.
Can you at least check for split ends?
Just run yourself through it one more time and we'll be set.
Sorry. Next time I'll go easier on the conditioner.
Rapunzel - uh, I said send down a beer.
You moron, just take the stairs
Perhaps a shampoo for oily hair might help, my lady.
Wait for the August humidity!
It’s called a Brazilian blow-out.
I see my new security system works.
Sorry, I'm using a new conditioner.
Would it be easier if I went with a perm?
Houston, we have a knot.
Well Smart-guy, you are the one who wanted to save a few bucks and buy me the cheap conditioner. How's that working out for you now?
I’ve heard that peanut butter will work.
Shall I let down my armpit hair instead?
If you think I'm going to braid all this for you, think again.
Sorry, I’m Rapunzel’s sister, Lubricious.
My 'No More Tangles' conditioner really works!
I thought Rapunzel was a woman's name.
I was also told not to leave the castle until I shaved my armpits.
No sh*t it's greasy
The elevator works just fine,Sir Dimwit.
It just said 'Hair growth cannabis oil from John Boehner.' 
Who knew?
I didn’t say pull my hair, I said, take the stairs.
I call it body-surfing.
At least you don't have to deal with a dragon.
I guess you found the gum from when I was six.
You thought "let your hair down" was just a figure of speech, didn't you?
Yeah, calling  yourself my "hirsuter" is soooo funny.
You're the mane attraction!
Maybe the coconut oil was a bad idea"
I guess conditioner wasn’t such a good idea after all.
Careful, I'm using a new conditioner.
Forget it Rapunzel, I can’t afford the shampoo
This is not romantic at all.
What are your pronouns, again?
Sorry, I just keep missing my hair appointments!
Yeah, well, I needed to wash that man out of my hair.
Looks like you're having a bad hair day.
Hair today and you're gone tomorrow.
The lady doth grow tress too much. My kingdom for a large comb.
Forget that I said, "I want to play with your hair."
If I had given you consent, it would have been braided...
Hair we go again!
I told you it would sweep you off your feet!
Use your key!
Alas, the witch makes me hirsuter with each Herr Suitor.
Was that a Freudian slip?
I told you we should have looked harder for an elevator building!
Does this strike the right note of middle-aged whimsy?
Did you find the louse?
Go away and stay the HELL out of my hair.!”
Don't hate me, but that was really funny!
Oh Rapunzel, too much Rogaine!
A Fairy Tale Split-Ending
My name is not Rapunzel!
of course, your welcome to use the stairs
Just what I thought. All talk.
I'm not ready to tie the knot!
Twelve months of hairdressing school and I'm just a glorified comb.
I'm sorry, you're just too clingy.
I let down my hair,what more do you want?
It's been 40 years dude; maybe we should think of a ramp.
At such ineptitude, my interest is falling.
Is this a Bad Hair Day?
Uh ... Babe ... 'let your hair down' means something else.
I know it has a bit more body than you expected. My captor is Vidal Sassoon.
This doesn’t look like the short cut”
You really thought you could get away with a one night stand?
Did I say there was an elevator?
I feel like our relationship is getting a little too tangled
It's the latest style; all the beautiful girls locked in towers by evil witches are wearing it this way.
Sorry to disappoint you. I'm just a guy in a rock 'n' roll band.
Darlin', give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming, steaming, flaxen, waxen
Give me down to there hair, shoulder length or longer
Here, baby, there, momma, everywhere, daddy, daddy
The last thing I knew I was playing baseball in Iowa
then......
All I said was "Is that a weave or an extension?"
My cousin Rapunzel is the girl with the hair you can climb on. Sorry.
Look, I just feel very relaxed around you.
If you can’t even handle my locks you wouldn’t possibly survive my leg hair.
I lost my hat!
I'm Lady Godiva, subbing for Rapunzel
The bottle did say bold and luscious.
Oh, where art thou, Rapunzel?
At least it's only head lice.
And if you have it, a really big comb!"
Well, yes, clearly the story would have been written a bit differently if it was known that I was gay, don't you think?
Hey, ever hear of a ladder?
Watch out for split ends!
That's not the fuller body I wanted.
I said I wanted to be "shaved" not "saved"
Quit being so dramatic. It's just a little argan oil.
How do you feel about snaking shower drains?
Help! There are 16 of us suitors trapped in here.
So, does it beat the waterslide?
Basically, it’s all extensions but I have a lot of time on my hands.
It's not the world's more ridiculous comb over, but close!!
I said send down your STAIRS...
Perhaps just a shaping my Lady.
My stylist calls it 'operant conditioning.'
It was probably better up.
Can you check if I have split ends?
Rapunzel, I've fallen and I can't get up!
You could've braided the damn thing ya know!
I can wash that boy right out of my hair!
wasn't this braded last time
This isn’t as bad as the time I got stuck in a spaghetti strainer for 3 days.
You are a louse!
That's for asking if the carpet matches the drapes, asshole!
I was serious when I told you to get out of my hair.
They don't call it No More Tangles Shampoo for nothing.
Yes, but no tangles!
I'm gonna wash that man out of my hair.
May I suggest we try braids?
Help! I am dis-TRESSED!!!
You weren't getting in wearing flip flops anyway.
Damn that conditioner!
You became untangled too soon
Alright, I’ll braid it.
Why am I wearing elf shoes?
The Queen considers it the castle's most precious hairloom.
You'll be choked unconscious; then I will absorb all your nutrients. We'll be together forever, my dear.
Let me guess, it was the "beanstalk" nightmare again!
Great, I put my hair down and you suddenly become such a fool.
'"Does this happen with other captive maidens?"
It's a hairy situation.
First time?
Well that was a let down.
Forget about yourself. Just send up the salmon.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let Down Your Scrunchie!
You must stop using TEFLON hair rinses!
What do I have to do to get you out of my hair?
Careful, it’s still wet.
It was a very long engagement.
Sorry- you must have grabbed an extension.
And that's when Rapunzel realized she'd used too much conditioner.
This is a hairy situation.
[blank would be best for this cartoon]
Be careful what you ask for!
Yes, Rapunzel, it IS soft and silky,
but I think you used too much product this time!
It’s not exactly the killer body I had in mind.
It's a bit of a hairy situation.
Next time I'll get a scrunchy
Rapunzel. Your Hair is such a letdown.
Perhaps a little less argan oil
And for the final step in my transition, I changed my name to Alfonso.
This relationship has always been an uphill battle!
Better make that two gallons of conditioner.
Maybe I should put in that elevator.
My hair extensions are strong; your climbing skills are weak.
To be honest I haven’t showered in a while.
It must be this new conditioner I’m using.
Told you I needed 20 minutes
You were expecting perhaps a woman?
I told you not to try it free solo.
Sometimes you fall in love in the most unexpected way, sometimes you just fall
Now let down some detangler!
What's the moral of "Rapunzel" again?
if you think this is a mess, wait till you see my freakin' hoo-ha!
Should we try using peanut butter?
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
„You lost the comb? Again?“
Quick! Hide before my dad sees you!
Sorry, you said you didn’t like braids.
For God's sake, Rapunzel I meant that figuratively.
What?  No gesundheit!
Frankly, to paraphrase Marie Kondo, this ridiculous haircut and this whole rigmarole with you aren't bringing me joy anymore.
For the 10th time Bold Knight. It is not a slide!
Another failed attempt to rescue the not so beautiful princess and the expression 'hairy experience' was coined.
I thought you said you liked extensions.
Now that's a 'let down'!
Actually Rapunzel, can you just cut thy hair?
It was a wet winter.
Just give it a minute, it'll grow on you!
Its true, blonds do have more fun!
Sorry, the king said use the new shampoo or it's back to the chastity belt.
And don't comb back!
Couldn't you at least braid your hair, 'punzel?
Wrong tower, buddy #MeToo.
Another suitor swept off his feet!
I appreciate your romantic streak, but why don't you take the stairs?
Sorry, I guess I used too much conditioner. Just use the elevator.
I really think you need a trim.
I'm Rapunzel, not 'repulsive', you cad!
I said, "No!"
The shampoo commercial said it would give my hair “body” but I wasn't expecting this.
Oops, I thought you meant all at once
I know. I know. Hair today, gone tomorrow.
Not to put you down but you're really bad at this.
I told you things get real wild when I let down my hair.
Sorry, forgot to rinse out the conditioner!
I can't come out, tonight; I have plans to braid my hair.
This new conditioner is really giving my hair extra body.
Sorry, someone told me jojoba oil is good for my hair.
He is going to take forever to comb out.
Daddy was right when he said men just wanted to use me
Hair Today Gone Tomorrow
I told you to bring scissors.
Sorry you're feeling dis-tressed.
Go find Jack, buy a bean, bring it back, and plant it.
It was then that Guenther realized Rapunzel hadn't had sex in a very long time.
Rapunzel....... Let’s just call the whole thing off!
Sorry! I used the hairspray with extra hold.
Rapuzzle of the week.
No traction. Must be too much conditioner.
When you're done playing games, you give me a call, okay?
Try it one more time. I was afraid I put too much conditioner in this morning.
Would barettes help?
I just thought you were mispronouncing "heir to the throne".
When you said the carpet matched the drapes, I didn’t know you meant they were all one thing.
I'm sorry I asked!
Plan B is my fingernails.
I'm sorry. I used a new conditioner.
I told you to take the servant's elevator. But do you listen to anything I say?? No!!
You should have taken the stairs.
Speaking of extensions, you really need a ladder.
They call it the wave of the future.
I hate facebook.
My conditioner?  Why 'Tsunami,' of course.
This is the dumbest cartoon I've ever been drawn in to.
Now go write about it.
How about we forget about this, and I let you off the hook for leaving the toilet seat up?
What a pain in the neck.
I said let down your hair, not drop it like a Trump tweet.
Admit it - you're falling for me.
May i suggest a combination conditioner/detangler?
Don't worry! The curtains don't match the drapes!
I've had it with all these New Yorker Rapunzel cartoons...
Trumped!
Was it too much conditioner?
It must be the new conditioner.
Can you look for my comb on your way up?
Darn static cling
I heard this was more safe than testing hair products on animals.
Well, Jon Snow wouldn't be flummoxed by a few split ends!
Ok, I say tomorrow we go with the  braids !!!!
Come back next week when it's less humid.
What?  You thought it would be clean?  It hasn’t rained all summer!
I guess you still haven't used your coupon from Supercuts.
Have you seen my hat?
Only you could turn "silky sleek" into a bad thing.
A hairy escape!
Didn’t I tell you that a ladder would be easier!
Now let's talk about unreasonable standards of beauty.
Like I told you before... my ends don't enjoy being teased.
Hang tight, I'll grab the peanut butter.
Rapunzel's Revenge
And yet I still have less hair than anyone in 70s porn . . .
I know you think it makes your hair feel  a bit stiff, but will you please use the hairspray with extra hold!
Rapunzel, it was just a figure of speech
If you thought you were getting braid, you're wrong!
Do I have any split ends?
Fine, I'll stop using conditioner.
Don't blame me.  You told me to let down my hair.
Hope it's not too much of a let down.
Alrighty then, I'll just get out of your hair.
You asked for long beautiful hair
shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen -- 
so I gave it to you, Lover Boy.
Ya wanna rethink that command, Honey?
Are my hair extensions too much?
Don’t even ask, yes the carpet matches the drapes.
You may be wondering how I hid so much hair under such a  small hat.
Yeah? Well, you try braiding all this after it's been washed.
I suppose next you'll be asking for my WIFI password?
I'm sorry, the witch tampered with the locks.
You kept me waiting a long time.
I only mean’t it Figuratively
What did I tell you about sneaking into my daughter's bedroom?
Begone! Thy ghosting doth portend foul virtue.
I think you overdid the conditioner.
That is not what I meant when I said that you should let your hair down!
A perm may not be a good idea right now.
Does the carpet match the drapes?
How much conditioner did you use?
Trying to sneak up and see my daughter, were ya?
That's the last time I use volumizer.
You should have come earlier.
Cinderella, you two-timing loser!  You called me Cinderella!
Last photo of Peter before he discovered the man-bun.
Too much?
It's that damn quantum entanglement all over again.
Take the stairs around back, the glue hasn't dried on on the extensions.
Extensions? Well,this is a let down.

I took a vow of hirsuteness
Yeah... Rapunzel took off with Robin Hood. I’m her sister Gertrude.
Rapunzel's trans twin snares yet another unwitting suitor.

You know, the elevator's just around the back.
Watch it! You’re splitting my ends
So, you're not staying for breakfast?
You're obviously not the locksmith.
This is a hairy tale ending.
As a matter of fact I've been using a volumizing conditioner.
I think you’ve overdone it with your hair product.
Maybe not all of your hair....
Forget smart home security systems.  Intruders seem less suspecting of my traditional locks.
What? Do I look that different from my tinder profile?
Sorry.  This always happens when I use conditioner
I call it my in-house moat.
There is an elevator, you know.
He, She, It

My hairdresser was deported this morning.
HERE'S YOUR HAT.  WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?
Maybe I should ease off on the conditioner a little ...
Did you use the shampoo for oily hair like I asked you?
The King's Fool, cast off by fortune, is wigged out.
Maybe you should just use the back door.
Note to self -- Change to 'Shampoo for oily hair.'
I said, 'Let down your golden STAIRS!'
Ok I'm sorry- your man bun was cool!
I guess Rapunzel doesn't cut it any more.
So, you thought you would slip away to some other long-haired girl in a tower, did you?
Working with consultants, I've monetized my confinement to create a theme park experience.

No flowers, no towers!
Wow, this Rogaine really works!

It may just be the new conditioner, but my hair has deemed you unsuitable.
This is NOT what I expected.
Where's MY animated musical?
OK, big deal, so I'm her sister, Repugzal!

No, I said let down your STAIR!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, bring up you hair, so that I may untangle  from this bad affair.

And sent him on his way.
Not again Hugh! How many times have I told you...wait till it’s fully dried!
my husband is here.
I'm dumping you because you get in my hair.
Everything gets tangled in these extensions.
I told you to get out of my hair.
You idiot, Rapunzel, lives next door.”
Sorry, 
I took out the braids.
When you said you were caught up in a wave I was thinking of something else.
Medieval Times’ worst thrill ride EVER!
Hair travel these days leaves a lot to be desired.
I know it would be easier, but braids don't suit me anymore!
All I said is that I wasn't in favor of a prenup.
You should have read the terms and conditions... the hat MUST match shoes.
Last fella went "Wahoo" on the way down.

Hark! Who tangleth yonder amongst my locks?
For want of a hat pin, the desire of love is lost.
I warned you not to run your fingers through it.
Get out! You are ruining the picture.
I guess I could do an up-sweep.
Are you in distress?
That's eighty years of growth... I told you to watch out.
Tangled?
I told you I needed a taller tower.
Couldn’t you wait to have it straightened tomorrow?
Did you have to condition it?
Enough with the Moroccan oil already!
I'm all tangled up in your split ends.
OK!OK! You’re having a bad hair day,
But why blame me?
Rapunsel it's me your hair dresser....Ricardo de Medici....
My mother was wrong when she said locks aren't everything.
Well this is a real brush with death.
Well, if it's my nose that sent you reeling, have a look in the mirror!
Oh...you said, "try some Nair".
What a shame we have to part on such bad terms.
Well, I didn't say to let down all of your hair.
Sorry about that, my prince. Looks like I used too much conditioner.
Yes I have been using a volumizing shampoo, why do you ask?
Whoa, Sorry! Guess I shouldn't have used that new volumizing shampoo.
How am I going to brush that out?
Time to rethink this

Don't let me down.
Give me the usual. A little off the top.
May I suggest that next time you use a ladder"
I can get my hair permed if it helps, but it will cost you a fortune.
No, just a trim.
Hey I’m just the UPS guy, call the Hair Club, stat.

Princess Rapunzel, founder of the "Did he climb up your hair? #Me too." movement, demonstrates a tactic.
My conditioner improves the feel, appearance and manageability of my hair, but  unfortunately it also reduces friction between strands.
Your hair literally took my breath away!
Reminds me of an old song, “Long, beautiful hair, shining, gleaming, steaming, flaxen, waxen, hair...don’t ever have to cut it cuz it stops by itself”.
Minoxidil  Shampoo. Why do you ask?
We tried your hair last year, in November. Now my hair isn’t working either. I’ve run out of ideas, just like the New Yorker cartoon caption editorial staff!
Well that is neither hair nor there.
I just washed it and can’t do anything with it
In New York it's called 'The Rachel,' but here it's 'The Rapunzel.'
I'm using a new "Extra Volume"  shampoo.
Help! I am falling and I can't think of a punch line.
I meant to swipe left
And they lived hairily ever after.
OK, now pass the conditioner.
I want to rescue you but I'm drowning in your hair!
Another "hair brain" idea.
I see your hat, but where’s the horse?
Rapunzel, is that you? It’s been too long!
My name is not Rapunzel, and PLEASE get out of my Hair !
I knew I should have asked for braids.
Not sure I like this new conditioner with added body.
I just had it straightened.
*sigh* I thought I had all the knights out of my hair !

I was speaking metaphorically!
My hair shall feast upon the bones of all encyclopedia salesmen!
You must use Head and Shoulders..
They never stop to ask for directions
Darn that Biotin!
What prince. And where's my pizza.
No one ever taught you how to braid a rope?
My hairdresser assured me it will only  add extra body.
Guess I'm the one who's stranded now.
Uneasy slides the head that wears a crown
For this to work, it requires more gelling.
Every relationship has
 its ups and downs
Now do you think my herbal supplement is a scam?"
maybe it's time to cut back on the conditioner
It was love or the Brazilian blowout. I chose the blowout.
Elevator is located in the back sir...
OK, good. Now tell me a hair - raising tale.
Of course it's oily. I haven't washed it in twenty years.

Braids went out of style !
Too late for a hair cut?
Well of course it's a little oily!
My cream rinse makes is satiny smooth and slippery as hell!
I just washed my hair. Try later in the week when I have some tangles!
Sorry, it’s a new conditioner.
The effects of climate change have gone too far.

I'm sure I told them just a little wave.
Sorry would a braid work better?
Help, I am in extension hell.
Just use the stairs.
Next time bring a ladder!
I’m thinking of donating to Wigs for Kids.
It's been a while since anyone asked me to let it all hang out."
I said to wear comfortable shoes!
Maybe I overdid it with my new volumizing shampoo?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!  Send down a life-preserver!
I  use conditioner to give it body.
He's been like this since Woodstock.
just get the leaves out.
Um, I guess you didn't have time to braid your hair first.
Hey--I'm just letting my hair down.
Don't blame me; blame the conditioner.
Next time, use the elevator.

It’s the satin pillowcase I’ve been sleeping on
Cut my hair? Are you insane?
Too much mousse?
Well you didn't say 'Let down your braid.'
Can we try braids?
I hope you enjoyed your hair raising experience.
Oh - this is what you meant by heir apparent!?
Did I overdo it with the hair extensions?
No, no. Not all your hair!
I'll ditch the new conditioner.
Weeeeee…Watch out for the knots.
At least I didn’t use gel.
Sorry, my new conditioner is really slick ~
Way too much conditioner!
Rob, I'm so sorry. No one has seen my hair since I started this effort, and thus I wouldn't have guessed that it would be so heavy and overwhelm you like this. But are those really your shoes?  Because if so, this relationship wasn't going anywhere
How many times must I tell you I'm NOT  Rapunzel!
OK! I admit I didn’t understand what I was asking for!
Rapunzel knew her extensions would sweep the prince off his feet.
Next time bring an extensions ladder.
Is a simple plait too much to ask?
These Rogaine ads are just getting weirder and weirder.
And you thought hair traps were only for your sink!!
Feeling like Congress should do something about guns now too, huh?
Numbskull, numbskull, let go of my hair!
Someone should've told her Woodstock 50 was cancelled.
Let me know if you find a pizza down there.
My neck muscles are to die for!
Yes, I’m leaving! Why? ...first thing, you use too much gel, secondly , you look just like me.
To cut a long story short, he dyed.
And don't come back until you've donated to Bernie!
This political climate has me parted down the middle
Maybe it's time to change conditioner.
OK, new plan.  Tomorrow, I won't use conditioner.
It’s easier to climb if you braid it first.
Welcome to Woodstock.
You might want to ease off the volumizer
Art thou one of the Queer Eye?
A scissor, a scissor, my kingdom for a scissor.
In hindsight, the mousse application probably wasn't the best idea.
Rapunzel? I was looking for Brenda's tower.
Washed that man right out of my hair
Forgive me my prince, I'm having a bad hair day
Next time, bring a curling iron.
Local tower height restrictions have made this less romantic.
Have you considered putting it in a bun?
This is the mane way I plan to keep you 
from leaving me.
It's a new conditioner.
Maybe I should have come up BEFORE you used the conditioner.
Doesn't take much for you to give up, does it?
I hate to give you the brush off this way, Sir Harold.
I told you “Enough with the Rogaine.”
Golden stair" is a metaphor, you moron
That's why they call it "finishing" rinse.
Now, what am I supposed to do?
Next time maybe skip the conditioner?
I used "Smooth and Silky" today.
Next time bring a comb
Must you complain? I love my new conditioner.
I chose the tidal wave over the permanent wave.
Snaired!
You misunderstood, I suggested that you wax your other jungle!
I told you to use the door by the gatehouse.
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A TRIM
I mean sure - I can toss you down a brush. But, I haven’t heard your horse or seen any movement for like ten minutes.
Okay, uh ... just a little shake should do it, then I’ll be outta your hair.
Bad Hair Day!!!
Try again tomorrow. I'll use a firmer  more climbable spray .
The Prince was having a bad hair day....
No one seems interested in the hairway to my heart.
I'm actually thinking of putting it "up" for a change.
Why didn't you tell me your last name was Krishna?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I'm using a full body shampoo now.
Gosh Rupunzel when I said let down your hair I didnt mean all the way
I put a lot of conditioner on it. I'll marry the first prince who makes it to the top!
maybe I am born with it, maybe its Maybelline
I dropped down a ladder along with my hair. Was that OK ?
Thought her hair would be a come on, not a capture!
Would you mind if I sent you down the road to go trim my split edges?

If you want to be rescued, You need to lay-off the hair gel.
You know what they say...hair today, gone tomorrow.
My hairdresser was on vacation.
Who knew she had a permanent wave???
The label on the hair softener warned that the hair would be unsuited for climbing
Maybe it's the new conditioner
It's great that you've come to rescue me, but did you bring any conditioner?
Darling ... Everytime I behold you I seem to be  swept off my feet...!
I’m gonna wash that ombré right outta my hair.
Don’t ask,  Dr. says it’s a side effect of my longer eyelash prescription
``You don't bring flowers, nitwit. You bring shampoo.''
I only hope my split ends didn't make it a rough ride.
Well, at least I'm stuck in the drapes and not the carpet.
I guess I might have over-conditioned...
I knew I needed to cut down on the conditioner.
This is the 10th time this has happened.
Thank goodness for “Tangle Free” hair products!
But you said braids are not a trend this summer
And they lived nappy never after...
I know, I have to find a taller monument"
Mean, ugly and built like a brick __ house. My kind of woman.
Perhaps I overdid the conditioner.
That's a Rap, Rump.
Boy, will Mr. Trump be happy to know I caught another one!
You either agree to marry me or I smother you!

There’s really no future in these Camelot theme parks.
Rapunzel having a bad hair day...
Allow me to rephrase...
Trying to get to the top is a hairy situation.
Has anyone seen my fiancée?
With all of my cross fit training, I thought this would be easier.
Sometimes the fool would get caught up in the King's antics.
I told you, 'a little dab'll do ya'!
How can twins have such different hair growth rates?!
Well— it is called ‘leave-in’ conditioner.
Have you tried the Aussie Leave-in Detangler?   This one is not working.
Sorry, the witch gave me a hot oil conditioning treatment.
It 's the new conditioner
This is not what I meant my knotty.
Hey, lighten up on the conditioner!
The mice and birds never had any problems braiding it.
I told you to use the stairs if you wanted to see me.
I'm afraid my "'do" has turned into a "don't."
If you're rude again, I'm getting a pixie cut."
You said you'd let your roots grow out.
Well this is let down
Well, that was a hairy ride.
if it makes you feel any better, you're not the first to be trapped in my volumizing hair mousse.
Sorry about the texture. I have the darndest time finding conditioner in 55 gallon drums.
Welcome to The Conditioner Challenge.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel...enough already!
The witch told me it would make my hair more manageable!
That's it. No more full-bodied hair treatments at the salon!
I liked you better when you had curls.
I thought you were training for this, Prince!
I have a contract with Stradivarius.
The moment “based on a true story “ was invented
I told you to hide, not slide!
So sorry... I promise you, once we're married I'll give up the weave.
Wait’ll you see the rest!
You said you liked it al dente.
NEXT TIME BRING FLOWERS INSTEAD OF CONDITIONER
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let your hair get cut and buy a rope while you're in the village.
I guess it's a good thing that society has already deconstructed the damsel-in-distress trope, otherwise you would really be in trouble.
For the hundredth time, I sent for the BARBER of Seville, not the Barista of Sherwood!
My mistake!
Thanks, I grew it myself!
You don't happen to have a scrunchy do you?
Like my new weave?
Vaseline Hair Tonic is too greasy
If you braid my hair,you can climb up.
And another thing: don’t even think of coming around again saying ‘let down your hair’ unless you’ve got Chinese carryout!
Do you realize how much time and effort it takes to brush my hair 100 times each night? And now you want to climb it?
I tried a new place called The Weird Sisters Salon.
I just started using a new conditioner.
Sorry! Too much static electricity.
Somehow I knew Rapunzel's father would foil my attempt.
You need to know how to tie that cute chain braid that I saw on Beyonce!
I’m a feminist now Tim, and that means growing out my armpit hair to revolting lengths and maintaining a BO musk to make myself undesirable to every human imaginable.
And then they lived, nappily ever after
Blame it on my split ends! Well, I’m gonna SPLIT and that’s the END!

Ooofff! Conditioner helps with tangles......
That was fast.
It's a slippery slope to the top, my friend!
I ran out of shampoo years ago.
Darn, Juliet!  Are thou sure that there is no stairway?i
Maybe next time not so much conditioner.
I was just interested in her hairess...
Now pull it back in.
Is it a deal breaker ?
Using this new conditioner may not have been a so good idea after all...
I’m not trying to smother you.
Don't fret. It's not permanent!
Go around to the back and take the stairs.
Forgive me, Lord Rapunzel, I wasn’t meaning to tangle with you!
Oh sorry, I thought you were here for my once-a-decade trim.
Look on the bright side: in a few hundred years, this will all be very valuable IP.
I keep telling Rapunzel one prince is enough!
''Yeah, maybe I should get a haircut.''
Um, I just wanted to leave a note.
Now we've swept each other off our feet.
You're tangled? Well, my brush is in there somewhere...
Rapunzel, I warned you about cheap extensions.
Go, follow the straight!
What type of conditioner do you use?
I'm stuck in a knot and can't get out!"
Camille Adams, Atlantic Beach F
Here I come world!
Are you 'Tangled'?
Her hirsute suit.
This is what you meant by “mane squeeze” right?
The princess? Well she's just a hair above the wrest!
You'd think we would have this down by now.
When I was young, they warned me about many things such as don't catch the plague or don't drink too much at the tavern, yet no one warned me all my friends would become climbers and I simply would not take to it.
I thought the silky smoothness would be a good thing... the models in the shampoo commercial seemed so ecstatic about it!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let up with your hair!
Not that much!
The Climate Change version of “Rapunzel, let your hair down”
Had you called first I wouldn’t have washed and conditioned it.
How about I send down the golden ladder?

You waited long enough.
Did you remember to bring the hair ties this time?!
I told you I’m SIKH not SICK! I don’t need your help right now! Can you please get out of my HAIR???
Whee! What a silky smooth ride !
Prince Hairy didn't have any trouble.
Did I over-do it?
Just think of how much we will be able to save on the cost of heating!
Sorry, I used a New leave in conditioner.
Sorry, my no-wash routine makes it all a bit tricky, doesn't it?
But GPS said this was Rapunzel's house.
Product!
It's more of a golden snare than a golden stair.
Let's try again tomorrow -I'll cut back on the cream rinse.
Just a trim" won't be enough in your case princess
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!  Remember how cute Audrey Hepburn looks in Sabrina with her hair cut so very short?

Why didn't someone tell me this wasn't a water park?
I've been thinking of getting a hairnet.
When you can't commit, and I'm left waiting, it gets hairy!
Come back when it’s braided.
Is that you Rapunzel, or is your father just having a bad hair day.

I'll get the detangler, again.
slide right to connect
Wow, that joker meant it. He said he would grease his hair if I tried to climb any higher. :)
Who do you think you're coming to visit, Rapunzel?
You’re using that cheap hairspray again, aren’t you?
You got the wrong tower buddy. Rapunzel's tower is the next one down.
You said we should tie the knot!
I wanted to be Rapunzel!
You asked for it, you got it, and I hope you're satisfied.
I guess it's good being King
The landing is a little rough, but it makes a nice slide.
I think I used too much hair conditioner.
King's hair slide. Signature required.
Climbing up was the easy part, Rapunzel.
Yeah, being in a tower cuts off modern hair care
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!
You have too much hair!
When he met Rapuzel’s father the first time, the prince found himself unexpectedly in a very grim situation.
I’m hungry. I thought you were bringing  sliders,not for you to go sliding.
I said, “Let down your golden hair, not drown me in it!”
How many times have I told you to use detangler?
Honey? Why did you lock me out?

Hey, you wanted me to grow out my bangs.
Repunzel, Repunzel. Let down your sissors.

I love your new conditioner!
I give up. Send me back!

There was an Old Man in the tower
Who said, 'I did not have a shower,
Or haircut, or lover
In ages, or maybe forever'.
Then sighed in my ear: 'The end is near'

Bad hair!
How do you like my new conditioner? You leave it in.
You're worse than head lice.
Try using the breast stroke!
OK, then you find a conditioner for both volume and control.

When the prince saw South Pacific on Rapunzel's Spotify play list, he knew he was in trouble.
I guess I need to stop using that extra body shampoo.
I conditioned last night.  Can you tell?
I will try a new conditioner.
At least it is easier than climbing up the spiral staircase...
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, what did you do to your hair?
I am Rap Unzel, product of the penchant for whimsical hip-hop artist names and a surfeit of Rogaine! Who the fuck are you?
I should have warned you I have combination hair.
With hindsight I guess they dwarfs weren't so bad.
The distance between us seems to grow every day.

Stop frolicking and get me out'a here
Rapunzel, how many times do I have to tell you not to use that hair conditioner!
I dunno. Don't some girls learn to make ladder-y things with their hair?
The carpet a mess too.
I switched conditioners.
What do you mean 'there's to much friction in our relationship?'
Yo dude,  I was trying to knock your shoes off.  They don't call me Ra-PUN-zel for nothing!"
I see you're using that conditioner again.
With rare exceptions, I skip the fiction.
I told you to buy the conditioner BEFORE the tariffs took effect!!!
Did you change conditioners?
I didn't mean to hurt you with a big let down.
It must be the new extra slip conditioner.
I am sorry, I agree it is time for a trimming but I have been too busy.
I guess the conditioner kind ruined the 'Golden Stair' thing.

Look, I'm having a bad lair day, okay?
I don't think "just a trim" will be enough in your case Princess.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Less Moroccan Oil in your Hair!
I said I wanted a french braid, not a french man.
You want my hair, you got it.
YIKES! Too much conditioner!!!
I can't find a reasonably-priced hair stylist anywhere in the kingdom.
Not so much conditioner next time.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down *some* of your hair.
This "no tears" stuff isn't working!
It said: „growth stimulating silk proteins for smooth shine.“
This new detangler is more trouble than it is worth.
I changed to a shampoo for thicker hair.
Oh there you are! I should let down my hair more often!
Please bring conditioner
I hope the carpet won´t match the drapes!

I guess that His Majesty is not interested in a haircut today!
I don’t mind a long carpet, but I would’ve preferred hardwood.

Before I give this another go, can we discuss the carpet?
Cher hair
If you think this is bad, you should see downstairs.
Sorry it's not silkier, my shower hasn't been draining for a while.
I guess I used a little too much conditioner...
It’s that full body shampoo.I thought it would help.
What was I think?
Did you say apply the leave in conditioner to myself, or comb it through with my hands, as I slide down to the ground?
You expected, maybe, it to be braided?
It's not the fault of the shampoo, it's the off-brand​ conditioner.
You've got to something about that conditioner!
A creme rinse. Why?
As I said in my profile, I can be a little much.
Poor Roudolf. He can help everyone but himself.
Hey! You're the one who said you'd cuddle!

Someone throw me a brush !
I told you I was having trans surgery!
There’s no getting up from that one.

You just missed her. She went out for more shampoo.
I think we're in the wrong meta-fairy-tale.
It might be better if you use the downhill skis!
When will you install the new elevator?
Do you know how to braid?
Sorry honey, I decided not to braid  hairstyles during the winter!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy detangler!
You didn’t tell me you changed conditioner.
Yikes!  I hate to think what a bad hair day looks like.
I told you to stop using that volumizing shampoo.
Don’t complain!...If I’d gotten that perm, you couldn’t climb up here

Every character we meet is in crisis.
Less conditioner, maybe?
Instead of getting lost in the fair maiden’s eyes, I’ve gotten lost in her hair.
It's silkier at the bottom.
It's your Rogaine, but my loss.
No, that's not what I meant by 'Please can I have a hair slide'
Do you use Herbal Essences?
There used to be a casthe and everything.

Do you think its time for a trim?
But I DO like the highlights...
I love it when you run your fractures through my hair.
I think I will say put your hair up next time.
I told you the slip and slide cream rinse was a wash!
I sure wish she would stop using that conditioner
Maybe you ought to cut back on the conditioner.
I 'm sorry to hurt your feelings, but that's the worst scaling attempt I've ever seen.
They don't tell you all the dangers of using too much conditioner.
How do you like the new way I am wearing my hair?
I told you not washing my hair for two years had benefits.

Hirsute offers him a hair suit.
He is overwhelmed.
Who knew that "Rogaine on the Rocks" should not be ordered by the tankard.
​"This is the problem of using too much Rogaine."
I told you not to switch your conditioner!
Let your hair down," you said
I found that I had a high false-positive rate, until I started using a moisturizing conditioner.
You'd think I'm asking for the moon! I'm just asking for a little extension, that's all.
Rapunzel: Don't you think you used enough Rogaine?
Rapunzel Rapunzel, I'll bring a ladder next time.
I told you I have wavy hair.
You shouldn’t have come after my deep conditioning

They ran out of my regular detangler at the drug store
Rapunzel is a cross-dresser!
Rapunzel, pull up your hair!
Too much Rogaine?
First time I've been stranded on a castle...
We wouldn't have this problem if you had bought me that conditioner I wanted.
I think I'm losing interest in e-mail.
Ramputz, I meant one strand at a time, not all at once !
Never saw any need to use Conditioner until now!
Sorry, I guess I "let down my fair hair" with just a little too much zest.

I'm using a new conditioner.
William Tell caught up in his comb over attempt

She got me coming and going -

Not quite what I was thinking when I heard 'wave pool'!
Sorry about that, the conditioner makes it slick.
I guess I didn't rinse out all the conditioner.
Don’t fight the rip tide!
Jeez, why are you feeling so offended? It was a compliment, for God sake.
You must have hit a split end - sorry I should have had it trimmed.
You should have waited until I put the conditioner in.
No wonder I can't make progress! She really oils her hair.
I thought you were getting a permanent. Not a wave
Ease up on the conditioner, Rapunzel.

Going up?
Sir, I believe the announcement was actually 'prepare for lunch.'
Go ahead, it's just one small step.
Shall I call you a shuttle?
I can only get you to the penthouse. After that, you’re on your own.
Sir, I have a feeling you’re at the wrong Kennedy center...
This is Trump Tower—we are all going down.
Can I assume you’re going to the launch party?
Yeah sure. 10, 9, 8, 7...
Look buddy, small step, giant leap, either way - it's the 5th floor.
I know you’re in there Mrs. Nusbaum and I still expect my Christmas bonus.
If you're searching for intelligent life, try another building.
A Russian gentleman went up before you.
The Apollo? It’s two blocks down on the right.
Well maybe she misunderstood when you said you needed space.
I heard the food and service was great, but the place has no atmosphere.
Watch the small step, sir.
Yes, I guess they do say, "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have."
Once again, we have touched down safely, Sir.
Lift Off" just means that the elevator is out of service.
My mother in law sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
Getting away for the holidays are we sir?
Let me guess......up?
It's not impossible that Mr. Trump has somewhat exaggerated the height of his tower...
When I said the lobby lacks atmosphere I didn’t   mean it literally.
To bed, bath and beyond !
That’s funny. When I was  a kid, I wanted to be an elevator operator.
Hold your mail again, Sir?
Would you need me to call you a shuttle?
Three..two..one..
It’d be a lot easier for all of us if you’d just get the vaccination”
First step, Mankind.  Second step, Menswear.
I'm sorry, sir, but the best I can do is the 78th floor.
Ground floor, Mr. Brown. Oops, I mean 'the Eagle has landed'.
Houston, The Otis has landed.
Sir, it's still not too late for a flu shot.
After the top floor you're on your own.
787,234th floor, please.
Go ahead sir, it's only one small step.
... in case it DOESN’T stop at the penthouse ??
Psychiatry - 5th floor, huh? Me too !
I think that you misunderstood the "Space Available" sign
Sorry, we don't go to where no man has gone before. We stop at 18.
You do know the Moon Room is just a bar ?
Take one small step off the elevator please sir.
After I release the emergency brake, you’ll have 12 seconds of weightlessness.
Otis, we have a problem.
Doors closing in T-minus 3.
Major Tom is on vacation this week,sir.  I'm Larry.
You look like you're on a mission.
For the last time, Tom, it's just a lobby and I'm not 'Ground Control'.
I see you're taking the shuttle to work again today.
Happy to do it, sir. 10…9…8…7…
Have you considered just getting a flu shot?
Sure, if it’s not the right stuff, you can return it.
" Having a hard time adjusting to your retirement from NASA, sir?
Please watch your small step.
Psychiatry ? 2nd floor. I’m on my way there too.
I’m not sure how you’ll manage but the men’s room is two doors down on your left.
Heading up to the satellite office?
My mother-in-law sucks all the air out of the room
Menswear?
There’s no countdown.
 Just tell me what floor you want.
I don’t care if it’s a small step or a giant leap, you just need to exit the elevator, sir.
I don’t think you fully understand the gravity of the situation.
Sorry...I just kind of assumed you were going up.
Your here to repair the satellite dish?
Does he know you're coming? Should I buzz Aldrin?
Like they always say: Dress for the job you want.
Elevator has landed
I'm afraid we don't go that high, sir.
I take it you're going up?
Isn't it early for Fashion Week?
Going to the launch party, sir?
I dress for the job I want, not the job I have.
Let me guess, you’re going up
Sir, the StarLight Lounge requires a tie.
Always great to meet a fellow gravity denier.
Mission Control or the costume party on 11, sir?
I’m sorry sir, the twelfth floor is as close as I can get you.
You should go to the bathroom first.
Sorry, you can't get there from here.
They sent me down for more Tang.
I'm sorry, I just assumed you'd want to go up.
I push buttons and a machine goes as high as I tell it to. It’s basically the same job.
Caught between the moon and New York City I see.
Fly Me to the Moon" is the name of our penthouse bar, sir
I'd be happy to count down from ten, sir, but I draw the line at making rocket noises.
I know, but it's the best that I can do while I'm caught between the moon and New York City.
Top floor! Sorry, this is as close as I can get you.
I am sorry, sir.  This is the lift up. Not the lift off.
I think you misunderstand what they mean by, “space available.”
The elevator refuses to move. It says you killed HAL.
Small step, giant step. Just step out of the elevator, sir.
How was your walk Mr. Armstrong?
Yes, the rent is astronomical.
The 19487167th  floor, please
Earth disappoints me on so many levels.
Yessir, there's space on the 12th floor.
So you want me to press 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in that order?
Dress for the job you want
Welcome to the Apollo.
If you’re interested in space, I’d recommend the three bedroom.
I can get you as far as 10. You're on your own from there.
I'm working my way up to the Vomit Comet.
Going out to launch, Sir?
Mind the giant leap, sir.
500,000,012 please.
I believe they were advertising work space, not space work.
Sir, would you like me to call a shuttle?
No Sir, Trump is still President.
Got as far as the stratosphere and couldn't remember 
if I turned off the stove."
Welcome back sir. Long trip?
Another book signing Mr. Aldrin?
One too many small steps for man today, sir?
Sir, I think you may be at the wrong 'launch party'.
Should I call you a shuttle, sir?
Yes, I'm going up. How did you know?
This is as far as NASA's budget will take you.
Shall I hold your mail?
One small step for man is as high as we go. The giant leap for mankind is the next car.
This is the headquarters.  You’ll want the satellite office.
I assure you, sir, I go to the one-hundred thirty-first floor all the time dressed just as I am.
Yes, sir.  I believe the cafe serves Tang.
You can take that off, sir.  Melania is not here."
The Eagle has landed.  Enjoy your day, sir.
Are we going to the moon again today, sir?
This is Ground Floor, Major Tom....and you're stepping thru the door...
The sign in the window says Space for Rent.
Trump's penthouse? No problem. However, I think the president exaggerated how big the building really is.
Go on! It's just one small step!
The Apollo is at 253 West 125th Street, Sir.
Would you like me to call the shuttle for you?
Shall I call the shuttle, sir?
I've heard that the restaurant upstairs is good, but that it has no atmosphere
Well, yes, naming it the “Space Needle” may have been a little misleading.
Are you from NASA or the EPA?
So I guess your wife loves a man in uniform too.
It's just one small step to exit the elevator, sir.
Forgot my keys.
Touchdown sir.
Have a nice day.
I don’t know that we go that high.
Someone took your budget to build a wall?
From out of town?
It’s one small step, sir
If this were a New Yorker cartoon, I'd ask if you were going up.
Due to NASA funding cuts, this is as far as you go.
Your son’s class will definitely be impressed.
The store is closing, sir. That'll have to be your last ride of the day.
The Apollo is a nightclub, sir.
I am afraid you don't understand the gravity of the situation.
Lunch hour? I thought the schedule said launch hour
No, it's pretty much a small step for everybody.
Fortunately, NASA comped me the room after it canceled my flight.
Sir, would you like me to hail you a rocket?
Remember, the President uses up all the air in 10 minutes.
Yeah yeah, I've heard it all before ... One giant step...etc. Just get out.
To infinity, or beyond?
Fourth floor, compression socks, catheters.
Excuse me sir. I think you misunderstood - I said we were out of  space
I'm not sure that's what they meant when they said there was space in the elevator
I think you’re at the wrong Apollo, sir.
The elevator has landed.
Well, it's pretty much the same size step for everyone, sir.
Just one small step, sir.
Yes, I heard the food is is great but the restaurant has NO atmosphere
Wait, don't tell me . . . going up?
You know we're going down, right?
This is ground floor control, Major Tom.
Watch your step, the last guy made a big deal out of it.
What time should I expect you for re-entry, Sir
I don't think we go that high.
Let me guess, going up?
Oh no sir. Fake moon landings are on the 63rd floor at Trump Tower. This is the Ted Cruz's father/ Kennedy assassination floor.
What a long, strange trip it's been.
Then just take me as close as you can.
Sharon and I broke up. I told her I needed some space.
Scene from Kubrick's lesser known film "2001: A Space Lobby."
He's in Florida, Sir, there will be enough oxygen.
Don’t dress for the job you have, dress for the job you want.
Yet another perfect landing, sir.
I couldn’t do what you do, being stuck in a small spaces all day.
I'm sorry, sir, but the highest we can go is the penthouse.
Shall I try to call a shuttle for you, sir?
Is she aware of the  gravity of your situation,  Sir?
Watch that one small step, sir.
Forgot my gloves.
It’s pronounced “How-stan,” sir, and we do not have a problem.
You're going to be disappointed.
I hear there's space available in this building.
Welcome back, Mr. Bowie, we've missed you.
Welcome home, sir. Long trip?
Hit the space bar.
How's that mold situation in your apartment?
You know what, I'll just press the button for the top floor.
59,726,538 please
Concierge, we have a problem...
Sir, I think you may have  misunderstood our courtesy shuttle system...
I'm not kidding. This is as high as it goes.
To the moon sir?
To your penthouse, Mr. Branson?
Elon, are you high again?
Excuse me Sir, was that 1 step up or down for Mankind
Third floor, moon landing and flat earth conspiracies, please watch your step. 
Next floor, UFO’s and Area 51.
You seem prepared for the gravity of the situation upstairs.
Can you take me back up? I forgot the flag.
Up, I presume?
It's a great building sir, just no atmosphere"
Venturing north of 23rd street again today, sir?
I can assure you sir that the restaurant has great atmosphere
So now everybody knows you live in the penthouse. Happy?
I'm sorry sir, Space Needle is just the name of the building
Should I call for a shuttle?
The hotel does offer shuttle services, sir. 
I’m just not sure if that’s what you had in mind.
Indeed sir, we've all had to lower our expectations a bit.
Yes,of course, as you wish: ten, nine, eight, seven...™
Uh Houston, we’ve got a problem
Up to the sky lounge, Sir?
The fake moon landing reunion? It’s in our Area 57 Ballroom.
Down to the parking garage. I’ve changed my mind.
I'm sorry sir, this elevator only goes up to the Troposphere,
Excuse me… I…I don't think this elevator goes as high as you're expecting.
Do you want me to countdown?
Here's the lobby, sir.  I'm sure the concierge can help you find a store that sells Tang.
You can do it, sir, it's just one small step.
I'm positive sir.  The farthest we can go is the penthouse.
I can get you to the penthouse, Mr. Silver, but after that you're on your own.
Funny!  We both work in transportation
I changed my mind
Taking off this afternoon, sir?
Nobody’s ever asked me to press that button before.
Is it flu season already?
off to film another fake moon landing sir?
I can get you to the penthouse. From there you’re on your own.
It's 11 small steps to your left.
I ran out of clean laundry.
Watch your small step.
The moon has changed a lot since you were first here."
I'm looking for the Starlight Ballroom.
Watch your step as you make 'one giant leap for mankind.'
I'm glad you felt that it was a safe landing.
It's just the one small step.
Sir, I can't take you up to the executive suite without a tie.
3rd floor - robot cranes, trace gas analyzers, titanium bolts, and women's lingerie.
And we have touch down.
Be careful of the step sir. Some find it small, but for some it's a giant leap.
I don’t smell anything.
Ground floor, Major Tom.
Go ahead, sir. It’s one small step.
All the way up, sir?
Actually, I'm going down.
Sir, watch your step.
1,367,890th Floor"
I can take you part of the way.
We've landed, sir.
Can you hit “sky lobby” for me?
I've been waiting my whole life for someone to request free-fall.
Here we are sir, the final frontier
I just needed some space this morning
Your fly is open.
Will you be leaving us today sir?
I'm sorry, sir, you'll need to take the express elevator or you'll never get past the gravitational pull.
My name's not Houston, and I don't care if you have a problem. What floor?!
Will you be needing a shuttle?
I'm sorry sir -- this is as far as I go...
No, this goes only to the Penthouse. You want the " Where No Man Has Gone Before" lift.
It's one small step to the lobby; one giant leap to Park Avenue.
Going up, obviously.
Sorry...
This is as high as we can go.
Perhaps you should have thought about using the bathroom before leaving the Space Station.
Can we skip the countdown just this once?
My other suit's at the cleaners.
I see you’ve reconsidered the ‘staycation’ idea.
You could say we’re in the same line of work.
No, Major Tom. This is the ground floor, not ground control.
I'm going down, actually.
Didn’t realize it was that kind of launch party.
Final frontier, please.
One giant leap to which floor, sir?
Define UP
Working from home?
Good idea—the landlord tends to suck all the oxygen out of his rooms.
Excuse me commander, this one only goes up to the fifth dimension
I love you to the moon and back, too, sir.
Believe it or not, down.
Does it look like I'm going down?
If that flying saucer was yours, it got towed.  Would you like me to call you a cab?
Careful.  It's a small step.  Not a giant leap.
The right stuff?  Third floor, sir.
Lets’s just say, his elevator didn’t go all the way to the top.
I’ll take you to the 40th floor.  You’re on your own after that.
This will be a disappointment.
I guess you read the review of our rooftop bar that said it had no atmosphere.
Is this where the new Space Force is meeting?
Up? I suppose.
Doors closing in five...four...three...two...
I know letting go is tough sir, but you’ve been retired five years now!
"I presume you're going up?"
I heard the atmosphere in America is toxic right now.
Good afternoon Elon, you're back from launch break early...
Yeah, bedbugs sort of weird me out too.
You left the flag WHERE?!
'Out for a walk, Mr. Armstrong'?
When we called it Atmosphere Lounge” it was just a branding exercise, I can assure you.
Astronaut lingerie please, 6th Floor.
To your right, sir.  The others are waiting for you.
Eleventh Floor. Unrealized childhood dreams department
Yes sir, Van Allen belts in menswear
The cosmonauts drove up rates at Trump Tower, so here i am.
I know the sign says “Space for Rent” but...
Well, if it makes you happy:  Three ... Two ... One ... Liftoff!
Are you sure that’s what she meant by | ‘needing some space’?” |
How about two medium steps so I can take my lunch break?
Sorry, there's no moon at the inn.
238, 857 please.
Good to see that you are prepared for the toxic political environment, Senator.
Are you going to take one small step or one  giant leap
I can take you as far as the roof, the rest is up to you.
The roof, Sir. May you have a most pleasant voyage!
I don't think this goes where you're going.
What floor is alterations?
Watch your step, Sir.  Gravity is in full force here.
There's a dehydrated fruit basket in your room
Mr. Musk, your car is ready.
Just one small step and you'll be in the lobby.
Just mind the small step there Sir.
Shall I count backwards?
Be careful of that one small step, sir.
Just take me to the top floor and I'll figure it out from there.
Going up, I take it.
They will know how to fix a zipper here, yes sir.
We're terribly sorry about the bed bug problem in your room, sir.
It's actually not that big a step.
Yes Major Tom, this IS Ground Control.
Going up I assume?
When the real estate agent said the apartment was "out of this world," that was a figure of speech.
This is as far as we go.
I'm sorry but this elevator doesn't go that high.
Well, this is as far as I go. Good luck!
Seriously, man, it's just one small step.
Please take one small step, sir.
Going up, I presume.
I heard the restaurant has no atmosphere.
Your floor Major Tom.
I agree. Christmas music is really annoying.
Regardless, no smoking allowed.
If it's hot air you're worried about I wouldn't take it off until the Senate trial is through...
Sorry Sir, but Trump Tower is not as high as he says it is
Last floor with a bathroom before the moon.”
No sir, M is the Mezzanine.
You're interested in the space for rent?
Taking the stairs would be 2,300 small steps for man, sir.
Right this way, please—the lobby is one small step ahead of you.
I'm sorry, this is the local elevator to the International Space Station.
I’m assuming you’re not going down.
Try jumping while we go down. It feels like there’s no gravity.
I assure you, Mrs Weinberg, we eradicated the bedbug problem three years ago.
You're sure this thing doesn't go any higher?
Sorry, but Pres. Trump is wrong. You can't take an elevator to the international space station.
On second thought, I'll just take the stairway to heaven.
Oh dear.  Did you miss your flight?
This doesn't go to the moon, and my name is not Alice.
Um, sir, this is the Apollo Hotel.
Launch not go well today, Mr. Musk?
Wouldn't it be easier to just get a flu shot?
| heard once you should dress | for the job you want and not |  the job you have, so...”
Here we are, sir, back to 1-G.
I can take you part of the way, sir.
I'd like the planetarium please.
Do watch the one small step, sir,
Beam me up, Ernie.
Watch that small step.
Bringing work home again, sir?
It's a huge step for me too, sir.
NASA budget got slashed again?
Careful, it's one small step.
You do realize that this is a three story building, sir?
I'm afraid you'll have to take the stairs the rest of the way.
I'm sorry sir, did you say Floor 51 or Area 51?
The air is thinner on the top floor is just an expression.
Last chance to use the bathroom, Captain.
I'll close the pod bay doors, but don't call me HAL
Twelfth floor: gravity, oxygen, restrooms.
What do you mean you "need a little space'?
Difficult transition, sir?
Your "back after launch" joke is always a knee-slapper, sir.
You can walk on the moon, but you can't take the stairs?
‘Its only a small step sir’
Sorry Pal, it's as far as I go.
Your visiting Mrs. Ralph Kramden ?
Going way up, I assume?
Beware of Alien life forms, you are in NYC.
I bet you’re going up.
Sir, please stop counting down.
Do you want the observation deck?
The tenant has landed.
The Germaphobe will see you now.
Sir, I believe the penthouse has scheduled a “power lunch” not launch.
Most of our residents just get a flu shot.
That's one small step, sir.
I mean, you could just get the vaccine.
The Otis has landed, sir.
The view from up top is unlike anything you’ve… well, it’s really good.
Chicks dig astronauts.
Sixth floor: Lunar rovers, golf clubs, Tang...
Earth, main level sir"
Do you have shuttle service here?
This is the local, sir.
It's ok. Just one small step.
All the way up I assume...
Would you like to do the countdown or shall I?
Down actually.
I only farted in here one time. ONE time.
Yes, it is one small step, but it's not for mankind -- this is your floor.
Sir, we've landed.
Good evening, Major Tom.
Watch the step. It's a small step for man, but you know.
Everything else was in the laundry basket.
First floor, the final frontier.
Maybe air pollution deregulation wasn't such a good idea.
Take one small step, and it's on your left.
So, buddy, what do you do?
A package came while you were away.
Beyond the penthouse as usual, Sir.
My guidance counselor said I could be anything too.
5th floor in 3... 2... 1...
One small step and you will be in the lobby, sir.
I'm just going to push all the buttons and we'll see what happens.
Small step or giant leap?
Will you be needing the Moon Buggy, sir?
I see you're new to the Republican Party. Trump Tower isn't literally "out of this world", it's just crap he says to market his brand.
I missed the shuttle.
Actually, Mars requires your key card.
What do you mean going down?
The bar is casual dress, sir. But I'm afraid you'll need a jacket for the outdoor terrace.
Moving: That’s One Small Step For Man, One Giant Sigh Of Relief ForThe Co-op Board
Forgot my charger.
It’s so the president can say we’re sending astronauts up again.
Oh so you heard the hotel has no atmosphere?
No, I don't think anybody will suspect you're a prostitute.
The listing said spacious not spaceish.
The moon is just above lingerie.
One time, just one time I had beans for breakfast and you still won’t let it go.
And that’s when I told  my wife. Honey, I need some space
NASA Recruitment Office on the right, Germophobe Support Center on the left.
I need more space
I think you will like the atmosphere on this floor
First time leaving New York?"
I like it, but the rent's astronomical.
Sorry, I can only take you as far as the 43rd floor.
The "ten, nine, eight" thing was cute when you were four, but...
This wasn't what I expected from the star button.
Just take one small step.
You know, sir, the garbage strike is over.
Sir, will you be using your frequent flier miles for this stay?
Mrs. Kramden! You’re back!
Going up, I imagine, Sir?
I don't know altitude.  What floor do ya want?
The breakfast buffet is five small steps down the hall, one giant leap to the right.
Please watch your one step for mankind
I believe the bedbug situation has been resolved.
What, on earth, are you doing?
Just get off this elevator.  I don't care if you start with a small step or a giant leap.
Okay sir, but this is the last time..... 'Prepare for lift off'
I work best under pressure.
Please take one small step back so I can close the door
It’s only one small step...
Mr. Jackson! Just get a flu shot!
You might think it's odd that we are in the space age and there are still elevator operators, but to me, the real mystery is why is there a chair in here?
Last time, you farted.
Good morning. To the moon, Alice?
You may want the express.
Down? Really?
I understand that it's Snoop's party, but just how high are you planning to get?
From here, you can take the shuttle
Thank you for coming quickly to fix the Presidential toilet.
Be careful sir, small step.
The restaurant has a great view but no atmosphere.
I see they’ve cut NASA’s budget again.
I cant find the zipper.
I’m afraid the “M” stands for mezzanine.
Close the pod bay doors HAL
My name is not Scotty.
It looks like one small step to me.
I was told that if I wanted in, I’d need to dazzle the co-op board.
I can get you to the roof, but the rest is up to you.
Fake moon landing auditions? Two doors down.
Welcome to the Apollo Hotel - Did you say Floor 1 or 11?
What exactly to do you mean by ALL the way up, sir?
I'm sorry sir, the "To the Moon!" button appears to be broken.
Houston, we DEFINITELY have a problem
You know, sometimes I jump a little on the way down, and it feels like floating.
My honeymoon wasn't what I expected either.
Ready for lift off?
Might I suggest an umbrella, meteor showers are in today's forecast.
Well the AIRPORT Shuttle will be in in 5 minutes.
I missed my flight. Can you hit floor 23,890 for me?
Careful, there’s a small step.
That’s one small step out of the elevator, and one giant leap for the continental breakfast.
Sign outside says you've got some space for rent.
Boldly going down?
Look, you'll have to speak up or lose the helmet. I can't make any assumptions here.
T-minus ten seconds and counting.
Bringing your work home with you, again?
Sir, you do know that our “Mercury suite” isn’t actually Mercury, right?
Fly me to the moon!
So, this is Trump's Military Space Force?
Lunar buggies, Satellites, Asteroids.  Thank you for shopping at Macy's, enjoy the experience.
I missed my ride. How fast will this thing go?
Down?  Are you sure?
The new apartments are spacious but maybe you misunderstood.
10? 9? 8? 7? 6? 5? 4? 3? or 2?
Yes, Mr. Aldrin, we all know that you walked on the moon.
Floor two thousand six hundred eighty three please.
Unfortunately, the plunger didn’t do the trick. I’m going in.
And 3…2…1…lobby.
Um, rooftop?
Moonlight Lounge or Mars Bar?
This IS ground control, Major Tom ...
Have a nice light year.
Watch the small step, Mr. Armstrong.
Unfortunately, the button to the Moon floor hasn't worked since the 1970s.
Taxis are one small step and one giant leap to the right.
Sir, I believe the ad said, "spacious" apartments.
No, it doesn't actually scrape the sky.
I agree with you. This place lacks atmosphere.
The air a bit thin on the 117th floor?
Going up, sir?
Forgot my toothbrush.
Way,Way,Way up Sir?
Yeah, NASA budget cuts have really impacted our training.
I borrow it for flu season.
You had a good trip I hope?
One small step should do it, sir.
That's one small tip...
Happy Halloween Mr Armstrong
Fifth floor, lingerie , decontamination.
Actually you don't need that- we got the elevator fixed.
Can you take one giant leap back?
Let me guess: they promised you the moon!
It might take a little longer to get there, but we will save the country billions!
Welcome to the 116,914th floor, featuring light oxygen, burning meteorites, space debris and obsolete satellites. Please mind the saftey warnings and guard rails on Exosphere Obsevation Deck.
I suppose I can get you part of the way there, sir.
Sir, the air today is really not that bad.
Are you sure your mother said you could go to school in that?
You should dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
Just press 3,2,1...
We just count backwards from 10, push this little button and up we go !!!!
My mom always said, “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.”
Sorry, Sir. P is for Penthouse.  Anyway, Pluto's no longer on the agenda.
My name isn't Houston.
Your rover is waiting at the curb
On your countdown, sir.
This place has no atmosphere.
What altitude, sir?
The Jetsons? Top floor.
Down the hall to the right.  But there's a line.
Should we hold your mail Mr. Musk?
You'll find can openers on five.
I can get you to the 50th floor, but from there you’re on your own”
Welcome back sir
President Trump they will still find you.
I think it just left.
High flyers lounge, sir?
I think you're taking "Space needle" too literally
To the Oxygen Bar, please.
Back in my day, "climate change" meant carrying your umbrella and galoshes.
Could I suggest a simple flu shot, Sir?
Reception, we have a problem
You know what they say, dress for the job you want.
I said, 'Close the elevator doors, Hal.'
These budget cuts at NASA have really limited the scope of our exploration.
3G the apartment, or the gravitational pull?
Please, no leaping of any kind.
Oh! I thought you said the dark side of the ROOM!
Going out for a walk, Sir?
I assume you are going up.
I'm a dreamer, too.
Sinatra fan?
Tenth Floor. The Right Stuff. The Left Stuff and All the Middle Stuff.
No, we do not sort of have the same job.
I grabbed the wrong keys.
Mr. Trump told you his Tower went to where?
Ten? Nine? Eight?
This is as far as I can take you,son.
Watch your leap, sir.
Would you mind saying "We have Liftoff" ?
Please take me where no man has gone before.
I heard he sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
How was it, Alice?
Your Planet, sir.
Watch that first small step!
This is Ground Floor,Major Tom.
Yes, four more years wants me to leave the planet too.
Great story. Now, please take a small step out of the elevator.
Ground, please, Major Tom.
Houston, we have a lobby.
Would you mind saying "lift off" after you hit the button?
NASA lost my luggage.
The fake moon set is right around the corner on your left.
This is the best I can offer you, a lobby with no atmosphere.
Yes, the penthouse is out of this world, but it still has oxygen.
You can go up, or down, there is no re-entry button.
Well, I'm happy to help but I think there's so much more to it than getting used to heights.
You do know we're in Cape Coral, Florida, right?
Things still toxic at home then?
Yes, I’m afraid the restaurant lacks atmosphere.
Yeah, well, the city ain't the kind of place to raise your kids either.
I am looking for the “moonwalking” competition
I hear that you should dress for the job you want, not for the job you have.
Welcome to the Space Needle. I hope, but doubt, we will meet your expectations.
I see our jobs to be very similar, only you have more buttons to push.
Thanks for opening the pod bay doors, Hal
The Eagle has landed, Mr. Baxter.
Ground floor. Terrestrials. Life, death, joy and sorrow.
Sir, it's just one small step
Is this not the landing you expected, sir?
True, the cheap seats are very high in this stadium but the atmosphere does support life.
Are you sure you have enough oxygen to walk down the stairs?
I thought the elevator would be faster.
The Coop Board says you have to return the terrace rocks you took.
Well, it's no rocket ship, but I make do.
Sorry, we don't go any higher.
Watch your one small step as you exit.
An elevator operator? Wow, the Upper East Side really is an entirely different planet.
Waaay behind in laundry”
I don't think your elevator goes all the way to the top.
To infinity, or 3rd floor menswear?
Floor 2, please, for man. And Floor 3 for mankind.
Welcome back to earth, sir. Things here are not quite the same before you left.
Ralph keeps telling me, "to the moon, Alice." I figure I ought to be prepared, just in case.
Boldly go where no one has been before and have a wonderful day sir!
Going way up, sir?
I’m just looking forward to a hot shower in gravity.
Watch your one giant step, sir.
Yes, Mr. Damon, I believe you mentioned that you can grow potatoes from poop last week as well.
This may take a while.
Let me guess, budget cuts?
Oh. You want a moon with a view...not a room with a view
Watch that first step.
Space station?
You want the express elevator.
More cutbacks at NASA?
Going up. Way, way up.
It's one giant step to your left and then it'll be on your right, sir.
Sir, can you please take a giant leap for mankind and exit?
I assure you, Sir, this hotel has a great atmosphere."
Re-entry sequence complete; lobby level sir
Ground control, please.
I see you fell for the hype about the penthouse level's breathtaking atmosphere.
Zero-G again,Frank?
Be brave. Its only four more years.
You'll find vacuums in our housewares department.
Sorry, there’s only one “G.”
I thought there'd be more cheese.
Climate change anxiety?
Welcome back, Mr. Mitty.
Oh, this is ground floor. Ground control is on three.
Soak it all in while you can, there won't be elevator music on the rocket ship.
Yes, it would feel like zero gravity if someone cut the cable when we hit the top floor. Why do you ask?
Good luck on your new planet Mr. Trump.
Thank you, Hal.
Uniforms suck, am I right?
Don't ask.
Wouldn't a flu shot be easier?
Shall I hail you a rover?
My therapist says that I need to overcome my fear of heights to be successful in my profession.
Sorry, but Trump Tower doesn't actually have as many floors as advertised.
How long do you have to wear that before you win the bet?
If you tip me enough at Christmas I will make rocket sounds as I take you to your apartment.
You realize the Orbit Room is just a nightclub, right?"
OK, let’s go for Zero G in this thing.
The real thing goes up much faster.
Hm, it’s not every day you see an elevator operator around here.
2,787,322nd floor, sir?
Well, there's plenty of space IN this elevator, but that still doesn't make it the Space Elevator.
They said I’d need to find another way up.
No, you're looking for the express elevator.
Ground floor. Earth.
Enjoy your holidays Mr. Musk.
Thanks for opening the pod door, Hal.
Express or local?
Down the hall, to infinity, and beyond.
To the moon, Ellis!
Forget something?
There’s a lot of space, but not much of an atmosphere.
T minus 5 seconds till the doors close.
You'll have to take the stairs the rest of the way.
Can you find your way back, sir, or would you like a tether?
Gosh Mike, you could have just gotten a flu shot.
Thanks George, that was the smoothest decent I’ve had in years!
Not exactly a ride of your lifetime, right?
I see your dog is having flatulence problems again.
This time, Mr. Aldrin, you can step off first.
Neil always dressed for the job he wanted.
Care to count us down?
My air-conditioning is extremely temperamental.
Well, judging by your outfit I would assume you want to go up?
Can't be too careful around the office during flu season.
Bad weather. Launch aborted!
I'm sorry sir, you need the elevators across the lobby.
John realized that the only way to avoid hearing another word about Impeachment was to rent a vacuum chamber at the local hotel.
212th floor. Oxygen tanks, satellite parts, moon boots.
Which floor is the fake moon landing set?
I just had this nagging thought I'd left the front door unlocked.
Eight thousand two hundred and thirty-one, please.
Yes, sir, I do realize that  flu season has started.
Floor 84,092,800, please.
I've seen all sorts of strange things in a lift, but never a chair.
Listen, I know it looks weird, but I'd rather figure life out in outer space than hear another argument against the impeachment inquiry. You feel me?
"I'm sorry, sir, the penthouse is as far as I go."
The Eagle has landed, Mr. Steinberg.
You want To Infinity and Beyond?
You could have just told me you don’t like my cologne.
Just took it for a test drive
Glad to see you're prepared for the 546th Floor.
Shall I count down, sir?
I'm sorry, but this is as far as I can take you.
Beam me up, Otis.
Watch your one small step for man, sir.
Can you give me some space?
Is this your first time in Denver?
We could go up again if you like the sensation."
Open the elevator doors, Hal.
A lot of pressure at work, sir?
We’re a new military branch.  It’s the only simulator we’ve got.
Sorry, it stops at the penthouse.
Who is Scottie?
Yes, sir, the oxygen's a little thin these days in the president's suite.
Nice disguise, Comrade Rudy. The Putin penthouse tonight?
To the top Mr. Musk?
They certainly are building them taller than ever, aren't they, sir?
You might have been oversold on the view.
Shall I announce you or will the Montforts recognize you?
Take me back up, Frank. I forgot my umbrella.
Ad astra, please.
Can you count down this time?
Do you know something that I don't know?
Going away for the holidays, Mr. Branson?
Goodnight and godspeed, sir.
Moon or Mars
This is Venus. Mars is two floors up.
It's just under 240,000 miles. And yes, this hotel does provide free shuttle service.
To infinity and beyond, ma’am?
I'm afraid this is still Trump Tower sir.
Sorry, Commander. This is as high as we go.
The agoraphobia clinic is on the left
Up, please!
Will it be a short walk today, sir ?
Mind the one small step.
C’mon. It’s not really that big of a leap.
Once again, Mr Nunes, this will not take you to the Moon and I’m also sorry to add that failure IS your only option.
Trump re-elected, so, Mars, please
Just practicing.
I took a Lyft. Don't ask.
Mars is as high as we go. For Uranus, use Elevator Bank #7
We only go to 12 sir
Sir, you do know it’s casual Friday.
Up.Wherever.
Sorry sir, this is as high as we go.
Sorry, the closest I can get you is the 22nd floor.
No one on this floor knows you're Mike Pence.
Is that you Scottie?
I prefer the term Resident Alien
Try the stairs. Those have flights.
I can take you as far as the penthouse. You’re on your own after that.
Yes, the Observation Deck is out of this world!
10th floor....9,8,7...
Be careful, sir. That's one small step.
They say dress for the job you want, not the one you have
You'll be wanting the lunar floor, sir.
The Stratosphere Lounge, madam?
Some days, even a small step can feel like a giant leap.
If you are looking for more space, I suggest a suite.
Your floor sir. Your room is one small step then a giant leap on the left.
My doctor prescribed this for all future travel to New Jersey.
Sorry, that floor does not exist yet."
I’m afraid the Space Elevator is still theoretical.
This is the ground floor. The eagle has landed.
Yes, this is the express elevator but this is as far as it goes.
My employer got downsized but I’m keeping my uniform.
The Otis has landed
You know something I don't?
It's ok, sir. I don't know what mezzanine means either.
Shall I begin the countdown, sir?
I agree sir, Space Needle is a bit misleading.
It's laundry day.
We don't have a Launch Cafe.  This is the floor for the lunch cafe.
Sir, did you park your ship on the roof again...?
Please tell me you’re only going to the penthouse.
I assume you won't be needing a cab
I heard that this hotel lacked atmosphere...
I'll have your rover brought around front, sir.
You up?
Coming or going?
The moon landing is down the hall to the right, Sir.
Laundry day?’
Sic itur ad astra?
Yeah...the new Space Force is underfunded.
Command modules, jet packs, and housewares are on this floor, sir.
That’s one small step for Bill one giant surprise for the lobby.
Another small step, sir...
Can you press Mars for me, please?
No, we don’t go that high.
I’m waiting for my career to take off
I think sir might be a little disappointed by our free shuttle service.
Major Tom, Going for your nightly moon walk?
Fourth floor: space suits & accessories, NASA notions, ISS home deco
To infinity and beyond, sir?
To achieve escape velocity, you should really take the express elevator.
Sorry, only 'Gold Club' members are authorized to access that floor.
This is your floor Mr. Damon, or is it Mr. Clooney? Or is it Mr. Pitt?
Yes sir, I am opening the doors, but I'm afraid my name is not, nor ever has been, Hal.
It's a bad air day.
Where the hell do you think I’m going?
One small step to exit, sir.  One giant leap to hail a taxi at this hour.
I'm sorry, the space elevator to the moon is across the hall. This one only goes into low orbit for interstellar spacecraft launches.
Last floor, sir. I told you Trump Tower isn't that yuuuge.
Okay, I'll say it:"The Eagle has landed."
Prepare for re-entry.
I don’t know about the moon, but here we have landed safely on the lobby, sir!
Prepared for lift-off, sir?
First Floor—Planet Earth!
Mission success. My ears didn't pop.
Mr. President
Ready to activate your exit strategy?
Yes, the prices in this place are astronomical.
Apollo you say? Is David Bowie performing?
They lost your luggage.again, didn't they?
10,034,849th floor. Going up!"
Floor 238,901 please
I understand your confusion.  Our brochure does say "We Cater to the Stars".
..Top floor I suppose?
Sir, the Stratosphere is a wine bar.
I said, "MARS!"
It wasn't me.
Today Mr. Kubrick said we’ re shooting the ‘one small step for man’ scene
Darn it, | forgot the flag.
Please watch your one small step, sir.
Would that be the stratosphere or exosphere sir?
It's not exactly a giant leap for mankind
Where are you going?
"To where no man has gone before!"

Next stop...Ladies Lingerie.
" I guess I'll never understand why you don't just get a flu shot like everyone else.
The stairway to heaven will reopen in 2020.
I can step out if you need some space.
They've really fixed up the place since you were here last.
Can you press ‘Take Off’ for me?
Rooftop bar sir?
And here we are sir, back on Earth.
The restaurant at the top has great food but no atmosphere.
Again, Mrs. Kramden?
Top floor. Linens, house appliances, Atlas V rockets.
Fifth floor; space heaters.
No sir, Cape Canaveral is three blocks south.
It does take time to acclimate.
These new skyscrapers just keep getting higher and higher.
Will you be taking our shuttle?
You say "Singularity?"
I forgot the keys to the ship on my dresser.
NASA's budget was cut again?
"Good morning, Commander, the President will be happy to see you after the Space Force goes on CNN  and announces it will investigate the Bidens.
Sorry, sir, the 12th floor is as high as we go.
Should I countdown first?
'It really is just a small step.'
Just landed... Long flight
I apologize again, sir. My wife's chili.
Straight to the top, I assume?
Great outfit for flu season!
Do you mind giving me my Christmas tip before you blast off ?
The elevator, uh ... I mean, the eagle has landed, Mr. Jenkins.
You were right, the Penthouse view was breathtaking!
I have to pee.
Close the elevator doors, HAL
“Trust me, the whole Universe is an awkward silence.”
5-4-3-2-1, Please.
Until people start vaccinating their kids again, I'm not taking any chances.
I may have misunderstood space for rent.
95,794th floor, please.
I think you'll find this floor has the atmosphere you're looking for...
Welcome to Venice.
My God, the lengths you one-percenters will go to avoid tipping at the holidays!
Some people will do anything to avoid tipping.
I'm here for the launch party.
Yes, I'm with the new Space Force.
I’d watch out. ICE is on the lookout for aliens.
I’m sorry, only 44 floors.
I think this means you're not going on the Moon mission.
You'll  get there faster in the express elevator.
July 16, 1973, Neil became the first man to stay at the Ramada.
My dance instructor says tonight we're going to learn to moonwalk.
Yessir, just one small step.
Non-smoking, I take it?
I can get you as far as the 90th floor...
200,000th floor please.
We're only going to the penthouse.
Kind of like yours, it has its ups and downs.
We could go as a bellhop and a spaceman
I was listening to '"Fly Me to the Moon" a month ago and got stuck in a song loop.
I assure you, he hasn't LITERALLY sucked all the oxygen out of the room.
It's a marvelous night for a moondance!
I am not sure if this is enough but this is the highest we can  go, sir
Another complaint about the Monolith on 42?
Watch your one small step.
NASA budget cuts?
It's just one small step, man.
I’mlookingforthespacebar
Welcome back to the ground floor Commander.
Watch out for that one small step!
Intergalactic level, sir?
Sir,this is as high as we go.
Let me off at the top
To the penthouse, sir?
Press 'Ignition' please.
Just one small step, Sir, and then one giant leap.
We've landed sir, welcome to the dark side.
Watch your step now, Mr. Aldrin.
And ground floor for Major Tom.
I know it’s a small one, but please watch your step as you exit.
Headed to an outer borough?
Between us... the oxygen bar at 59th and 3rd is substandard.
10 to the what power, floor?
Floor ten please... then nine... eight... seven... six..."
Are you one of us, Sir ?
Looks like you've still got a long ways to go.
To the roof?
I know just how you feel-‘Going up?’ jokes....I’m so over it.
100,000,000th floor ?
Welcome to Mars. Turn left for the immigration line.
The Lift Off Will BeDisapointing
Up sir?
I'm afraid this is going down, sir.
Can you hear me Major Tom?
Going up--or going down?
The Skylounge is open until moonset, Mr. Musk
Frankly sir, I found your countdown from the 10th floor a little nerve racking.
To Mars, Mr. Musk?
Ready?
I guess flu season started
This is as close as we get to Mars, Sir
I guess you have to get creative Mr. Giuliani.
Another soft landing sir.
Need a lift?
Is the flu season early this year?
5th Floor, Vaccuums
Third Floor: Cosmetics, Hosiery, High Acceleration G-Force Training Centrifuges and Women's Lingerie.
I couldn't tell you whether it's an alien atmosphere, sir. I haven't been outside of this elevator since 1962.
Shall I press, Lift Off?
Out of Tang again Sir?
Please watch your step. It's not a giant one, but we do have gravity here.
That's one small step as you leave the elevator.
Hello, Major Tom.  Welcome to Ground Control.
I guess this is the day I finally get to hit THAT button, Mr. Musk.
I'm afraid even our largest accommodations won't provide you with the space you need.
Hail a capsule for you?
I assure you sir. Every floor of our hotel has enough atmospheric pressure, that that, won't be necessary.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for men's suits, lingerie,  and casual wear.
Three, Spacewear and Ladies’ better dresses.
What level is the hoax photoshoot on, please?
Welcome to the alternate universe of the Trump Tower, Penthouse!
The perfume department sir.
FORGET YOUR KEYS AGAIN?
YOU DO KNOW WHEN YOU INTERVIEW FOR NASA THEY DON’T MAKE YOU WEAR THE SUIT?
Erm, going up?
And how is your application to the Mars colonization program coming along, Mr. Dickson?
Can you hear me now Major Tom?
So they still don't have women's toilets?
Very true, Sir!  We’ve both had our ups and downs!”
This IS the top floor, sir.
Watch that first step....it's a doozy.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for germaphobes!
Going up is easy, coming down is hard.
Slip the surly bonds of this elevator.
One of us is in the wrong place.
Apparently, 'wear a suit to the interview' was not open to interpretation.
This is as high as NASA will go these days.
Holodeck, please!
I'm sorry, but the sky's the limit.
I need to run out for a Mars Bar
Well Sir, It's just one small step.
So what!  You have a uniform for work, too!  So what's the BFD?
3...2...1........Lobby!
To the penthouse, and beyond, as usual?
When should I say you will be back from Mars if your wife asks?
I think you'll find our lobby pleasantly terrestrial.
I'm sorry, sir. The aerospace conference was yesterday.
Yes, sir. You certainly can't be too careful, sir.
Someone always does fart in the elevator don’t they.
How high can you take me?
The buffet’s just past the monolith—if you become the star baby, you’ve passed it.
I believe this is your planet, sir.
Yes, Sir, I believe the flu season is nearly over.
I'm afraid the elevator doesn't go... quite that far up.
You'll have to get off and change over to the express on 42.
The decor might be a little bland, but literally speaking, it does have atmosphere.
Where we're going, we don't need elevators.
It’s no problem. I need the overtime.
Talking apes? You've been gone an hour and a half.
Yes, sir. Fresh paint, new carpet, and ready to colonize.
Terrible disguise, Mr. Trump!  Congress will see right through ya.
Don’tcha know?  You can try an’ hide, but you cain’t always run!
This is the top floor.
It suits you.
This is ground control, Major.
Fifth floor.  Men's underwear.
Here for the Kubrick Cosplay, Sir?
not much of a skyscraper.
It's a Blue Moon tonight.
I'm sorry sir but this elevator does not go that high.
I’m going to meet Mrs. Kramden.
Did you get your flu shot?
Please sir, it’s just a small step for a man.
Actually, down.
You'll have to walk from 12.
No sir, it's not. But this is as high as we go.
I'm still going to talk to you.
Tell the super the laundry room needs his attention.
Up, I assume.
Floor 453244 please.
you know, there’s a shuttle.
Year 2050 “Heading out to Central  Park sir?”
An itchy nose is only one of the problems.
Good afternoon Mr Aldrin
She said not that kind of space.
Moon exhibit? Observation level sir.
Take one small step.
Moon roof, please.
Stratosphere or bathysphere?
Yes sir. Space Force Recruitment, 13th floor.
No, this is the lunch floor.
No need for the space suit, I heard she's not contagious anymore.
You're an optimist.
This is the mezzanine. You want the lunar landing.
Fourth planet from the sun, please.
One small step for man, one giant leap for elevator music.
I think you want a much higher floor.
I got on the wrong elevator, didn’t I?
Are you here for the taxi to NASA, the limo to MGM, or the shuttle to the hotel Halloween party?
That’s one small step for a man, a thousand fewer steps than if you took the stairs.
Yes, Mr. Musk, we think we found your Tesla.
Aren't you in my triskaidekaphobia support group?
Seventh floor, Space Suits, Jet packs, Tang...
Lift-off in five...four...three...two...
You'll have better luck with the express elevator.
Space Available” just meant there’s an office to rent.
Moon Lounge. Watch your step.
It’s suit AND tie for gentlemen in our dining room, after six.
It appears everyone's gone out for launch, sir.
Going up! in 3...2...1...
The stairway to the stars is around the corner to the right.
Actually, it’s also a small step for mankind.
Good luck with your interview to lead the Space Force, sir.
Going way up?
Top floor. From here you're on your own.
To the roof garden - and Beyond!
Top floor, I'm assuming?
Good evening, Mr. Musk. Launch pad I presume?
How did you know my name is Scottie?
Out of  order sir. The small steps for man are on your left.
10,000th Floor Observation Deck
Where you the thump on the roof, sir?
I think the smog report was a little overstated.
It’s nice, but it lacks atmosphere.
It's HAL's day off today.
Stage 2 please.
Initiating door closing sequence...up button engaged...and departing in 10...9...8...
Bringing your work home again, Ms. Davis?
Observation deck, sir?
Just relax and press the buttons in exactly the order I tell you.
Know when the shuttle bus gets here?
Ok, if I must... 10!..9!...8!..7!..
Looks like another week for the sanitation workers' strike.
Going up, way up.
Yeah we told them it wouldn't work either, but they cut NASA funding
Now boldly go where the last tenant went before.
Going to the EPA hearing, Mr. Wheeler?
Up.  Waaaay up!
Several of my bosses consider me a 'space cadet', so the suit became inevitable.
Floor 12 ... liquid oxygen, launch pads, multistage rockets, flight plans...
Mars to the right, Venus to the left.
Sir, we're going down...
Sorry, this is as high as I go
Which planet, please?
I assume going up?
No, this is the second landing.
Cutbacks.
Just a small step this way, sir.
Way up, please
Wait a second this isn’t mars
8,473,600th floor please.
Eighth Floor - Atrium Level. You will want to walk to your right for the launch platform. Good Luck!
Let’s defy gravity.
NASA cut your budget again?
134,112th floor, please.
Perhaps I ordered the wrong shuttle for you?
Here you are sir...floor 2001
Seriously?  For 12 floors?
NASA having issues with the microgravity machine again?
I'd try the express.
Beam me up to the top floor, please.
Please exit, it's just one small step
Back to the moon again?
Well, yes sir I did say the penthouse suite was rarefied air, but...
I don't take chances with air quality anymore.
NASA has really cut its training budget.
The Starlight Ballroom is straight ahead, Sir.
Moon rocks on this floor
Back from the moon already.
Are you sure you’re from around here?
You're right, the prices are astronomical, 
but the food is out of this world.
The whato-sphere?
My apologies. Maybe we lied when we said our rooftop view was “out of this world...”
This takes a while; the building has over a million stories.  Not to worry, so do I.
It's about 29 small steps to the hotel bar.
International space station, please.
Enjoy your stay in LA
If you're looking for the new Space Force- you've got the wrong building.
I see you have prepared for their toxic culture, Sir.
I took HRs advice and dressed for the job I want
Moon, Mars, or Jupiter?
110th floor. Oxygen tanks, jet fuel and moon boots.
Sir, this elevator only goes to the 55th floor. If you want to go to the moon you will have to transfer to another elevator.
OK, forget it. It's just that since we're both basically in the same business, I thought maybe this year you could be a little more generous.
BUT MR. JONES YOUR APARTMENT IS ONLY ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.....!!
I understand, Mr. Jones. You're leaving because you just need more space.
You must be the new penthouse resident.
Perhaps you have taken the advice to bring protections for the date too literally, Sir.
— On which floor Mr Apollo?  - 11, please.
Well..they were out of the Santa suit
Is it just me or does this simulator seem a little slow?
The Starlight Room is to your left, sir.
I forgot my phone.
NASA cutbacks?
You don’t look like you need a cab.
Is there something about the 17th floor that i need to know?
Sorry, this elevator doesn't go up that high.
One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind's aversion to elevator conversation
Can you believe that NASA put on elevator music for the whole trip?
Staircase: the final frontier.
Fourth floor moon wear.
Do you mind counting down from 10 first?
Is this high enough for you sir?
Ralph's been promising to send me to the moon for years.
Sorry for that rough landing, sir, but one small step is all you need from here.
Please don't say, 'Going Down.'
Going up, yes, but not that up.
Handi-wipes are on 7.
Sorry, this elevator only goes to the top floor.
Very nice, sir.  I see you have been packing for Mars.
This lift’s off, you’re going to need to take the stairs.
Going way, way, way. way, way up?
I’m here to see Elon
Will you be going out for a walk?
I only go as far as the penthouse.
Huh. I’ve never actually seen a chair inside an elevator before.
Sorry, this is the Local.
The plague is on floor 27, Ebola is on floor 28, 
Cholera is on floor 29 Sir.
What do you mean, "where is the rocket?"
Keys again?
I guess you're looking for an apartment with space
Lemme guess, Penthouse"
You know, people can still breathe on this floor.
I might only be able to take you part way
I guess you're going way up.
More budget cuts?
I don't want to talk about it.
Launch Pad straight ahead.
To the moon sir, or just the rooftop?
This is the first time we've used the "free fall" button.
To the moon, Alice
Enough climate change for today?
The Sky Lounge is not THAT high, Sir.
We are ‘go’ for the penthouse suite.
I find holiday gatherings alien and life-sucking.  Good thing the invite said “Dress for the Occassion.”
Well, I can get you to 25.
To the moon or the ISS, Mr. Musk?
This is the observation deck. The other elevator will take you to the Moon.
The atmosphere is laden with pretentious perfumery, be careful.
Well it is flu season.  Over.
Welcome back to Earth.
Building that wall had really affected our budget at NASA
For better atmosphere, head over to the cocktail lounge.
Sorry pal,this is the 51st floor,not Area 51.
Welcome back, Mrs. Cramden, I think you'll like the changes.
I gather you are going up Sir?
Morning, Mr. Pence.
What is it today, sir, taking off or landing?
Wow! Penthouse prices really are astronomical
You hear about Pluto?  That's messed up, right?
I thought taking the elevator would be safer.
Don't you wish, just once, you could say, 'Mind the giant leap?'
Bringing your work home again Mr. Tyler?
Floor 226792, sir?
I guess up or down is kind of a moot question at this point
One small step for man, huh? You couldn't take the stairs?
Sorry, small steps for women are on the fifth floor.
Is it to the dark side this time, sir?
You don’t need to say it every time Neil...
All the way up, please.
Did you say "down?"
The Moon.
Going up, Mr Musk?
It’s just that asking if you were “going up” seemed appropriate.
Penthouse, yes. Space station, no.
Wow! I guess there are severe government cut-backs on astronaut training, huh?
Observation deck, please.
You have reached your final destination.
I'm not ground control, Major Tom, and I'm getting tired of you announcing that your stepping through the friggin door.
Convention or bachelorette party?
It's an open space office
No giant leap. Just watch your next small step.
For stratosphere, exit here and take the express elevator.
Ready for blast off to planet 17G, Mr. Carlson?
You know this elevator only goes up to the 60th floor.
Just so you know, this thing has limitations.
Buddy, it may be one small step for you, but it’s 38 floors to me ...
Your ride is waiting!
Going for a walk this evening, sir?
Sir, the Moon Hotel doesn't actually go to the moon...
And you can enjoy cocktails and a panoramic view from our exclusive exosphere balcony...
New suit?
Antivaxxers or climate change. Take your pick.
Is it safe to come back to earth yet?
Osmophobia clinic? 
That's on the thirteenth floor.
I don't think that "the penthouse is out of this world"  is exactly what you think it means.
I hope you don’t mind confined spaces.
Oops, I mean the Eagle has landed.
Here you are Mr. Armstrong. They're waiting for you on set.
Tang for breakfast again sir?
No sir, I didn't read the article about all the people who've suffocated in overcrowded elevators'
Sir, please be more specific than ‘beam me up’.
No, it's the shoe department.
I almost didn’t recognize you, Mr. Aldrin.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...Lobby!!!
To the penthouse and beyond, Alfred.
How's the atmosphere on the 1 per cent floor today ?
Do you require a shuttle service?
Take me to the highest floor, and I'll take it from there.
You want to go where?
Will you splash down in the pool, sir?
Not exactly a giant leap for mankind, but it is the fourth floor.
3, 2, 1– lift off!
Please watch your first small step...
You realize, sir, that this floor is the Mars candy company?
The roof, I presume?
Welcome back to the worldly cosmos!
Looks like you could use some space.
We all need a little space sometimes.
Despite claims, Trump Tower doesn’t actually have | a billion-anth floor

Mens' clothing please...I need a new suit.
Infinity and Beyond , please!
Should I hold the elevator for you sir?”

I'm sorry sir, this really is the highest this elevator goes.
Just buzz me when you want to splash down.
Low Earth orbit, please
Go ahead. It's just one small step, sir.
Welcome to my world
Up" or "Down" it is all the same to me
I don’t think this is what she meant when she said she needs space.
My therapist says this is the first step to overcoming my fear of heights.
I only stay here when The Moon is full.
Well, what planet are you looking for??
Venus or Mars, Sir?
It only elevates so far, but it's one small step in the right direction.
Fifth floor. Men's wear
Do you think I'd be wearing this if I wanted to go down?
No, just one button at a time. It's really not rocket science
Both our costumes are kinda lousy
Where to Mrs. Kramden?
I’m sorry sir, going down is not an option
Ladies lingerie, please. I like to feel sexy under all this equipment.
Tranquility Basement, please.
Welcome home sir. Your "out of town" guests have already arrived.
One small step for mankind, one giant leap for penthouse living.
Ooh! Before you push the button do you think you could do a count down?
I forget how tall this building is sometimes.
The air on this level has been breathable for almost three weeks.  I swear.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Amazon packages.
Yes Sir, it was quick wasn't it.
The suit isn't necessary.  The entire store is non-smoking now.
The space capsule is now a restaurant sir!
You'll need to take the stairs the rest of the way
Want to count down with me?
Fly me to the Moon and let me wish upon the stars.
I can take you as far as the penthouse.

Please take one giant leap off the lift for mankind
Ground floor to Major Tom?
Welcome to Mars, Mr Musk sir.
Going up, up and away, sir?”
The Thousand Mile Club reunion is to the left.
It's literally just one small step down the hall.
You said you needed more space.
You seriously want me to do a T-minus five seconds countdown?
Taking the rocket ship today, sir?
T minus 5 seconds, sir.
You should have enough Tang to get you to nine, sir.
It's my first day on the job, just how tall is the building?
I only go to the 25th floor, you'll have to transfer
I just need some fresh air.
Rockets, shuttles and lingerie.
I think you're really overreacting to the one time I passed gas.
Go ahead, sir..It is not a great leap or anything... just one small step...
11th floor:  please mind the small step, no need to take a giant leap.
What will it be this morning Mr Armstrong, a small step or a giant leap?
Like I told the others, the President exaggerated the height of this Tower.
Considering it's just an elevator ride, I think we're both a little overdressed.
Millionth floor, please.
Yes Sir.  I'll take you up as high as I can.
Did you forget your keys?
Very smart, sir. You can't trust the atmosphere down on Earth anymore.
I can only take you to the Moon.  The elevator to Mars is under construction.
Out for a walk, sir?
Elevator to Houston: we've landed.
Just a word of advice. Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell.
First floor, again, sir. Will we be riding back up to the top again, sir?
Our celestial ballroom is to the right."
89408, sir?
No, this isn't the Apollo Theater.
Re-Entry?....dunno but here be the lobby!"
NASA out of funds? GuessTrump spent them all on 'Space Force?'
I'm sorry, sir, but this is as high as it goes.
He asked for a Uber driver  not a scuba diver
Walk straight then turn right and there should be a shuttle waiting
Yes, achieving exit velocity is always a problem.
Better luck next time.
Unfortunately, sir, the elevator doesn't go that high.
It may not be a giant leap for mankind, but please mind the gap nonetheless.
Didn't I see you with a deep sea diver at a party three weeks ago?
It's the flu season, and I'm not done Holiday shopping yet.
You're going to wear white after Labor Day?
You know this only goes to the tenth floor, right?
So, how high up does this thing go?
How far up are you going?
I'm afraid that this is as high as I can take you, Sir.
Sir, I believe you will need the express elevator
Just one small step for mankind and you'll be on your floor.
Would you like the mesosphere or thermosphere?
If anyone asks, you didn't see me.
Lagrangian L2, sir?
Turns out the stairs didn't have all the right stuff.
How high do you think this elevator goes?
are you going up?
Yes, sir. We have oxygen and artificial gravity in the lounge.
I understand you like to be prepared but no suit is needed at the Space Needle sir.
Did your ears pop?
More budget cuts to NASA this month, sir?
Sorry Buzz, but this elevator only goes to Bed Bath & Beyond.”
Just press up, up and away.
Eh...Define top floor.
Sorry I spaced out just now, what was the question?
Houston, this is ground floor.
Unfortunately, this elevator doesn’t go that far up.
Sorry sir, this is an elevator, that's not how these work.
Yeah, it has its ups and downs.
Well, I can take as as far as the roof.
Welcome home Major Tom. I'm so happy the circuit was fixed."
This isn't going to be another fake moon landing, is it?
Using us for training following cutbacks on the NASA budget has really helped my job security
Long year at work?
How is your acrophobia therapy going Mr. Finster?
Sir, there's no need -- it's only the third floor.
Sorry, can't help you...if you have a problem call Houston.
You'll have to get the next one.
If your ears pop, gum also works.
Could you please take one small step back?
A step, a leap, anything will do.
...and I’m shopping in a most peculiar way.
How high do you want to go?
Does the moon make the Earth look fat or is it just all that excess water weight?
Really? Going down?
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we don't have a 3,414,003rd floor.
Ascending?
No, sorry, it’s just 1. No ‘Ignition.’ No ‘blast off.’
That's one small step for a man, but a 20 floor leap for the elevator.
There you go, 89,000th Floor!"
This one goes to eleven...
It’s time to leave the capsule if you dare.
Yes, this is the Richard  Branson wing Sir.
Going out for some fresh air?
I don’t trust elevators and I’m not taking any chances.
MR ARMSTRONG, THE STAGE IS SET IN HALL NUMBER 8°
Down?
Ready for lift off, Sir?
Penthouse, sir?
No, I will not count backwards from 10.
Would you like a countdown before we launch?
It has its ups and downs."
"Tell me about it.
Two small steps, sir. No need for a giant leap”.
That's the price I pay for living on the 90th floor.
She said she'll meet you at the outdoor terrace and apologizes for the dress code.
10? 9? Or did Neil say 8?
Would you please stop singing 'Fly Me to the Moon'?
Budget cuts, huh?
Dare I ask? Going up?
My bad. I thought you said 'cosmetology."
It is time to leave the capsule, sir, if you dare.
Sorry but this is as high as I go.
If you see my ex-wife floating around out there, tell her I said hello.
Guess the Air Quality index is bad today?
Sorry Neil, we don't  go that high.
Yes Sir, you do look wonderful Sir, but Adam said nobody, not even you Sir, can testify while wearing a Space Force uniform.
It's easier if you get vaccinated...
only 12,813,333 more floors to go
Low or high stationary orbit, sir?
Any suggestions for launch?
Another plumbing problem in the penthouse?
Top floor, sir? Or beyond?
Welcome, Space Force Cadet, to the penthouse suite at Trump Tower.
Our penthouse has tons of space.
Permission to come aboard Captain.
Sorry.  This is a local
Why Mr. Musk - we weren't expecting you until next Tuesday!
Welcome back, Mr. President.  How was the moon rally?
Penthouse, sir.  This is as high as we go.  Have a nice day.
I'm sorry sir, but I'm not quite sure how to get to the moon."
Top floor. Open that window and jump really high.
I can get you as far as the roof.

Welcome to Mars-a-lago!
You're welcome, but again its Bob Smith, not Roger Houston
I really wasn't expecting you to be going down.
No gravity, but there is a Starbucks.
And call up the Rover; I’m headed to the grocery.
I’m sorry, but we have only fifty floors. You might want to check the Kennedy Space Center down the way.
I don't think pushing buttons repeatedly is going to help.
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Which floor?
Well this isn't Mars.
Mind the landing, Sir
You mean the "honey" moon suite, right?
Where else would I be going?
The air quality improves once we get above the 6th floor”
No, this one doesn't do weightlessness simulation.
Back to the future, please
The hotel's shuttle to the cape won't leave for another 45 minutes.
Long flight, Sir?
The millionth floor??
I'm afraid this is as high as it goes, sir.
Touch Down
I can give you a countdown if you like.
I guess you took them seriously when they said the party would be out of this world.
Are you sure?"  "We only play  the song 'Fly Me to the Moon'
‘I’m sorry, this is as high as it goes.”
Rooftop Mr.Musk. Your ship is waiting.
So its true that rents are skyrocketing?
It's been a tough flu season
Sorry that things didn't work out with you and the deep sea diver.
What? I’m on my launch break.
Whoa, Bro. Last thing I remember is a big black hole.
I assume that you are going up?
The seminar is to your left, Mr. Musk
May the Force be with you.
I admire your ambition...but this building only has five floors.
Eighth floor: environmental disasters and housewares

MTV has missed you, too.
One small step, Floor 9...one giant leap Floor 99.
Sir, we don't go up that far.
You realize this only goes up to the 60th floor, right?
Sorry, 1250 feet is as high as we go.
Good night Mr Sinatra.
Prepare for liftoff.
You can’t get there from here.
If you don't like it, you're welcome to use the stairs
Sir, do you need some space?
Would you like to press the button or should I?
This is as far up as it goes.
How’s the atmosphere in the lounge?
How long since you changed the kitty litter?
President Trump, welcome to Mars.
Sorry, one small step won't be quite enough.
You still get out of breath taking the stairs?
I afraid our Starlight Room will have do.
Welcome to the newly renamed and remodelled Donald J. Trump Space Center.
My pitch Is still a bit long.
need some space!
In 3...2...1...
I'm sorry sir, but that's as far as I can take you.
Shall I start the countdown, sir?
Can I help you, sir?”  
“No. I just need a little space.
Going for a walk again, Buzz?
Next floor: infinity and beyond.
10? 9? 8? 7? . . .
Ready to take the training wheels off after today?
I see that they're still shampooing your carpet, sir.
Sorry, I assumed you'd be going up.
Please watch your one small step for man.
I'm afraid the building doesn't have a millionth floor, sir.
Another small step, Mr. Armstrong?
I already got my step in for the day.
It's one small step.
953rd Floor, please, and step on it.  I missed my flight.
I hear the view is breathless.
Which floor?  Ten … nine … eight … seven …
Forgot my wallet.
Watch your one small step, sir.
Great landing.  It's been a privilege riding with you.
What did you expect?  The moon?
Tonight's food tube special has received excellent reviews.
Climate change is a bitch.
Are we there yet?
Will this get me there?
You’ll find the flannel underwear with a rear flap in the  lingerie department on your left.
One giant leap and you're there.
Suits?
I’m quite certain they were speaking figuratively, sir!
Going up Mr. Armstrong?
Moon boots? Take one small step out and twenty giant leaps to your right
Keeping up appearances for the sake of the kids.
That was some serious g's.
I believe you. The commute must be hell.

The International Space Station? That would be floor 134,112.
Mars again Mr. Musk?
Did they run out of flu shots?
Habitable? Just barely.
Per ardua ad astra sir?
Would you also like a countdown, sir?
Are you my mother?
Floor 3,874,890,432. Here you are sir.
Could you count down from 10 before liftoff?
The next 238,900 miles are on you.
I’ll need your card to access that floor, sir.
Fart confidently sir.
I trust this floor will have the atmosphere you desired.
I heard the cost of staying here was sky rocketing.
Floor 10.  No, 9.  No, 8.  No, 7...
Top of the Atmosphere, Sir?
So let's have a talk about expectations...
Sir, you do know it only goes up to the 7th floor, right?
Fifth floor, lost and found.
Good morning, Mr. Aldrin
Sorry, the pool is closed!
The Halloween party is long over, but glad to take you up!
You have quite a few packages waiting..."
The star just means ground floor.
Hold on tight!
364,669,235,905th floor, please.
No, sir, this is the Apollo Theatre.
I'm afraid you've missed the shuttle.
Down the hall and to the right, must hurry sir the hatch is about to close!
The earth looks like a big blue marble from the penthouse here at the Dubai Marriott Marquis.
I think gravitational conditions today will allow you to take a walk without tethering yourself to the building, sir.

Skybridge to Saturn, Sir; mind the rings.
Do you want the Aquarium or the Shuttle deck?
When the door is closed, shall I begin the countdown as usual?
I’m afraid this is not a skyscraper, sir.
That countdown thing you always do is really annoying.
Just push the top button really, really hard.
So much for one small step.
Sorry you feel there isn't enough space in here for you.
I'm sorry sir, this elevator doesn't go UP that high.
Houston, we’ve got a Porter.

One small step for Menswear.
Would you take the stairs when you carry out the litter box"
You're right. There's a rarefied atmosphere at the top.

We're downsizing at NASA ,take the Macy's escalator to the launch pad, then turn right!

Sorry, we don’t go that high up!
Which planet sir?
Mr. Houston is expecting you sir.
Sure, Mr. Collins, I guess you could call that a giant leap.
That's one small slide for the door and one giant press for the doorman.
Wait until the conspiracy theorists find out about this!
This way if I fart no one will know.
I think you'll find the climate still to your liking, sir.
This elevator doesnt go to Infinity and beyond. Thats the elevator in the toy store down the hall.
Sorry, sir, but this is as high as I go.
Dressin' for the job you want. eh?
The weather outside is frightening.
Watch your small step for man, sir

Mars Pavilion, Venus Ballroom next.
I'm sorry, this is a down elevator.
With the latest cuts, this is about as high up as we can budget."
I was supposed to fly today, but my cat talked me out of it.
It's one small step for ground floor.
That's one small step for man, two small steps to men's accessories on the second floor.
Have a nice space walk, sir. Your LEM is on Parking Port 3.  You wanted me to  remind you that young Krater needs two space rocks  for her science project, approximately 4xpi/3 in diameter. And the missus needs a quart of Rocky Road for Galileofest
First thing. We'll get the super to repressurize the penthouse, sir.
8,425,748th floor.

I assume you want me to do the '3-2-1 blastoff' thing?"
Tory Hoen, Brooklyn, N

I am sorry sir,  I thought you said the honeymoon suite.
The final frontier sir
The listing said 8F is out of this world.
Sorry, we're going up!
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-liftoff.
Is this about the cat lady in 6-B?
Not without an executive keycard
Which floor, sir?
Of course it's real. I got it in Chinatown."
Take me back to the lobby, it actually said “There’s space on the third floor.”
Enjoy your orbit, Sir.
Don’t. you get sick of people asking if your job has its ups and downs.?
I already tired the stairway to heaven.
Okay, T-minus 10...9...8...
Yes, I understand why you can't stand it when someone farts in the elevator.
Getting off the lift ?
What planet, ma'am?
You DO know this building only has 30 floors, right ?
I heard the view up there is out of this world.
Burning out the old fuse again, Rocket Man?
I'm sorry sir; the "Mars" on the door refers to the candy company.
I hope your date doesn't prefer down-to-earth types, sir.
Yes, I do find it a bit claustrophobic.
Going up?"
"To the moon.
It doesn't travel fast, but it certainly shakes like a rocket ship
Only the prices go that high.
I would've bet a million dollars you were going "up."
Careful, it's one small step, but its tricky.
Blasting off again, sir?
Alien Overlords' conference on the 13th, sir.
She said she needed space
Shall | tell your wife you needed some space, sir?
Russia is already up?
All the way up? Very well, Sir.
I understand you, these days all we all need is more space.
Okay, okay...you win. You take just one small step and I will do a giant leap for you.
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969.
My microdose was too big.
I can take you to the roof, but you'll have to hitch a ride from there.
Penthouse, then?
Yes, sir, it is a high floor, but I assure you that you'll be able to breathe normally.
What level? Troposphere? Stratosphere? Mesosphere? Thermosphere or Exosphere?
Sir, sorry to disappoint, but M doesn't stand for Moon
This is Mars, sir. For Jupiter, wait for the next stop, please.
I’m afraid this vehicle only goes so far as the Moon Lounge on the top floor.
I’m afraid this is as high as it goes.
The room needs cleaned THAT bad?
No, sir!  I don't think they'll be able to recognize you.
You’re an elevator operator!  You don’t see that much these days.
Headed to work?
An oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, just as you specified, sir.
I'm afraid we don't go that high.
It only goes to the seventh floor
Sorry sir, we don’t have space in the building.
Isn’t it obvious?
Hi Buzz, you've just missed Neil. He said to meet him up there.
I fart before you get in ONE TIME...
Second floor: asteroid belt, Mars and "The Twilight Zone."
The 173rd floor please.
I'm sorry, sir.  This elevator only serves floors eleven to thirty.
You want WHAT floor?
No.  This is ladies lingerie.
What? They said dress for the job you want...
I believe that there is at least one Sears left in this galaxy.
Are they done filming the moon landing?
Planet?
Ground?
Rents in this building are astronomical.
If you push the button and say "blast off,"  I will hurt you.
Exosphere?
Going up? Yes, but not that far.
I need to practice my space elevator pitch.
I’m not sure I can take you that high sir.
Are you sure you want to step out there? Just saying.
Returns Department please.
I’m afraid the penthouse is as far as I go, Sir.
Hilton, I think we have a problem
But this is already “As far as she goes.”
Last off!
I am sorry, I couldn't get it to blast off, sir. You can try the countdown in Times Square in another couple of weeks though.
Welcome.  I gather you just came down from our space station, conveniently located just above our penthouse suites.
Sorry but because of budget cuts, this elevator now only goes up to the Stratosphere
I wanted to be an astronaut but dreaded the thought of confined spaces and crash landings.
I'll notify facilities, the Tesla is on the roof.
Stratosphere, sir. You're on your own from here.
Ground control to Major Tom. Going up?
God speed, Mr. Glenn.
Sir,this elevator can't go that high!
Long work commute?
You expect me to say "Up" don't you.
You're down to earth now, Sir.
We had the elevator fixed. It stops at the top floor now.
Sir, no need for a gas mask in Hong Kong today. Mr. Xi  agreed to the '5 Demands'.
Why is there a chair in this elevator?
So Space Force didn't get that rocket budget, huh?
Sir, I don’t think this is what it means to ‘dress for the job you want...’
I believe Ground Control is on this floor.
Sir, I believe your a little confused on the meaning of cyber-sale.
Hold the door, I'll be right back. Forgot my keys.
Are we going to be back by the end of my shift?
It's slightly cheaper to launch from the 57th floor.
Sorry man. CosmicCon is next week!
Diaper duty again, Mr. Barton?
Sorry, I can't take you all the way up there.
Top floor and beyond please.
The moon walk contest is on the fourth floor.
C’mon, Mr. Aldrin, I told you I quit eating taquitos.
There’s a trampoline on the roof and from there you’re on your own.
Going down? How ironic!
I'm used to having a lot more space than this.
This is not my floor.
I know, it's a lot more fun going up than coming down.
Haberdashery.
This is as far as I go. The stairs are on your right.
Ground Control to 18th floor?
Keep your helmet on. You'll find the Park Avenue air is rarified.
Been operating the Wonka elevator for years, sir - and never been requested to push that particular button.
You're going to have to take a rocket after the 19th floor.
Because, sir, this isn't Willie Wonka's elevator.
It’s one small staircase for man, but you can take the elevator.
How far up do you think this goes?
I’ll leave a you message, on the dark side, in the dust.
NASA is going green.
I just get the flu shot.
My friend, we guarantee the service to be stellar.

Observation level, please....
Basically the same job only fancier equipment
88,173rd Floor, please.
I've had my ups and downs as well.
Which way's Houston?
Good morning, Mr. Musk.
The sky’s the limit?
To the rooftop parking, thanks.
I need space, Gary.
Here you are sir, home—where | no one can hear you scream.
Not Star Trek and I am not Scottie!
That was scary. I'll never ride an elevator again.
The penthouse, please.
OK, so just imagine doing this 13,411.2 times, 100 times faster than we just did, and you’ve got it.
One of us wore the wrong uniform.
Oh wow, that was my second career choice!
Will the Penthouse do?

I will have your car fully charged when you return Mr. Musk.
8,654,855th floor sir.
Is this the launch pad you had in mind?
No, sir. You'll have to change at the mezzanine.
I swear, you say "Going up" and then laugh one more time..."
So sorry sir,there is no elevator service to the launch pad. I'm afraid you'll have to walk up.
I assume you're going to the penthouse?
Penthouse, please.  I hear the air up there is rarefied.
I think you’re way overdressed for this ascension.
I don't suppose you're going down.
You know this elevator only goes up to the stratosphere?
Yes, going up, but not that far up...
Sorry, we don't have a ''stratosphere.'
Now we will see how many G's you can take!
4G only sir but Lenny down the hall will take you to the moon and back for a $5 tip.
"Top floor please. I'll get the rest of the way myself ."
The hundred and fiftieth  floor is not that high.
Third floor - lingerie, housewares, moon rocks.
Any habitable planet,please.
I'm sorry sir,this goes to the Veterinary Hospital "spay station"  not the "space station".
Will you be going up or down?
Have we landed?
No giant leap this time, Sir. A small step will do.
The leader’s office is the third door on the left, but he’s hostile to foreigners.”
How far 'up'?

Two million please
Higher, please.
We only go to the 24th floor, sir.
Sir, we don't go beyond the penthouse.
The bedbug infestation on six?
We don't go up that far, sir.
I'm not really sure living in the world's highest penthouse is worth the effort.
That's how I started.
I think your co-workers might be pulling your leg about our moon deck.
Major Tom. Please..,step through the door.
Sir, it only goes 12 floors up
10, please. Then 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Sir, you're already on the top floor.

Alice, we no longer go to the moon.
Sky Lounge?
The launching pad is on the penthouse level.
I ll try my best, but the ceiling is still out there
Do you want me to do the countdown again?
You might want to be seated. This thing takes off like a rocket ship.
You know, there are quicker ways up.
Back for some reentry?
Blast-off in 10, 9, 8...
The anti gravity room is next to the bar.
Psst...it’s flat!
Yeah, Houston was sick of all my problems.
Gravity, am I right?
Pardon me, but the notice said tenants must prepare for the lift to be off.
I'm your ground control, Major Tom.
Your luggage will be brought up by one of our space cadets.
Yeah, burrito day is a rough day in the elevator.
Are you sure you want to go down?
I need to start slow for the high G-training.
Sorry, Sir, this is Hotel Canaveral.
Third floor, vacuums.
Right this way, Mr. President.
I have to ask , your not afraid of heights are you?
Suit yourself, but may I suggest that your attire to ride up to the 90th floor is a Bit Over the Top.
One small step to the 17th sir.
They stopped the countdown at 3 so I could get my lucky socks.
Ok, Mr. Aldrin, one small step...
We will reach a maximum ascent speed of 10 miles per hour.
Stratosphere?
No,not THAT small a step - you're still in the elevator.
Wait. So that’s what’s on the 13th floor?
Not enough oxygen on the third floor, sir?
The rooftop terrace has plenty of 
outer space.
The “Space Force” meeting wasn’t what I thought it would be
There are three moons orbiting the penthouse. Which one?
Yes, the penthouse is an excellent start."

And we have lift off.
You said the 2,000th floor?
Once again , with feeling. Up, Up,and Away !
Can I have room service send up your launch?
I'm sorry, this elevator will only get you to the 30th floor...
They say it’s going to be a red one.
Yes, sir, of course, it's good to be prepared.  But this building only has four floors.
More budget cuts at NASA?
I understand your pain, the new directors are not as talented as Mr. Kubrick.
To the moon and back, please.

A rooftop launch does shorten the distance, but not by much.
This just goes up to the fourth floor, sir.
Don't complain -- the Russians switched to using stairs.
You know, they’re not all giant leaps.
You’re thinking of that building in Dubai.
I didn't realize the toilet overflow on four was that serious.

To infinity and beyond
So sorry, this elevator doesn't go that high.
Yes, there is Tang available in the Milky Way suite. I’ll see you again when you are ready for re-entry.

In case the Clean Air Act is repealed.
Ground floor please, Tom
When you get to your floor take one small step off the elevator and then a giant leap into your room.

It's not exactly what I expected, to be honest.
I'll take you up, sir, but no counting backwards from 10 this time.
Third floor, Menswear,  Manchester, Mars!
A few years after winning the chance to observe how government works, Jim's recent health conditions progressed to the point where he had to retreat.
I don’t go up that far!
Only enough oxygen for one, so don't ask.
What moon is this?
So that's one small step out of the lift and then one giant leap to the left.
I'm sorry sir, we only go as far as the 22nd.
I forgot my sunglasses in the Cybertruck.
I'm sorry but the moon landing was never an option on this elevator
I promise, they said I can keep the suit after the photos.
Really nice to see that they finally upgraded the rockets
Sir, I know you're going up, but this is the wrong ride.
I know-air quality has taken a hit since this administration has taken over.
Sorry. Not allowed to take it up a couple of feet for you to make a giant leap. Don't care who you say it's for.
I swear the smell last time wasn't me.
Penthouse or the pool today, sir?
Zero G is doable, but not recommended on this elevator...
The Moon Lounge is down to your left and the Mars Bar is straight ahead.
Hi. I want to reach before Chandrayaan.
I bring you glad tidings!
No, sir. M is for Mezzanine, not Moon-Landing.
You thought this was the levitator?
Sir, I’ll take you up, but I don’t think Mr. Trump was serious about the  whole Space Force thing.”
I still can't get you access to the roof...and the 'thin air' above the seventh floor isn't the reason.
I look at the unprotected elevator personnel, then at the Geiger-Mueller counter inside my helmet. This level of radiation exposure? He’ll be dead in weeks…maybe days. But we need SOMEONE—it’s just too damn hard to push buttons in these puffy gloves.
Going up, you say?
There's no space for you here.
It's a security issue - I work for Trump
Yes. We go up, but not that far.
I can take you up to 18...not sure what you do from there.
All out for vacuums
Thirteen? The manager tell ya? Quantum fluctuation up there could trigger a vacuum bubble. Yep. It'd expand at the speed of light 'n wipe out everything. Most hotels don't bother having a floor like that, but, hey, we ain't most hotels!
Sixth floor...now it's time to leave the elevator if you dare.
Must have been a heck of  a Halloween Party.
Just another Spare The Air day
Is this a straight to the moon kind of day, sir?
"Scented candles and perfume. Please check you oxygen levels...
Be careful out there, Fella.  I don't think you're ready for the current atmosphere.
There's an alien world out there - be careful!
I see you’re going up to the POTUS’s penthouse.
No, Sir...we do not have a floor 85 thousand!
It's not the launching pad, but you can get there from here.
Level 4. Apollo and turtle necks.
My cousins told me if you jump while the elevator is landing, it'll take you straight to the moon
OK, but the 36th floor is as high we go.
Sorry sir.  We don't go any higher than ten floors.
I presume you are going down.
So sorry, sir - my liftoff button is out of order.
Houston, we have your floor.

Floor 37 sir. The flat earth convention is just down the hall

I’m guessing that NASA cut the training budget again?
Take me up to sea level please.
I said “up”.

One small step for me, one giant leap for my families' penthouse dreams.
Sorry, rest rooms are for guests, only.
Sir, this elevator doesn't go beyond the 12th floor.
3, 2, or 1?
Roof deck, I presume?
Yes, I've heard Trump funded this moon resort out of the NASA budget, but half the profits go to the Klingon Empire, so it's ok.
Sorry you took the wrong elevator.
What you looking at ? Get your iphone 11 out and start shooting away sir- we still have time to make it to the evening news!
Watch your step, man.
Watch your step, Mr Armstrong, lest it becomes a leap in this gravity!
Yes sir, this the top floor!
But, this is the top!
Be careful.  It's a jungle out there.
It’s really just one small step.
That's one small step, Mr. Armstrong. Have a good day. See ya when you get back.

It only goes sixteen floors.

It's one small step for Man and one giant leap for New Yorkers
Yes, sometimes getting service to "rocketer" can be challenging from this floor...
The second manhole on your left is the clogged sewer
I know. I should take the stairs.
Sure, the brochure said 'to come sleep between the stars', but this is really the highest we can go.

Sir, this is Hilton.
What exactly are you supposed to be?

I'm more than happy to help you time your jumps, but surely there must be better ways to prepare for zero gravity.
The restroom is straight ahead on your left.
That's one baby step for mankind

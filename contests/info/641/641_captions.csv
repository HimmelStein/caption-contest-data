I'm not sure how many there are. Every time I start counting I fall asleep.
The new rug arrived, but there's some assembly required.
Just tell Dad it’s a staff job with a leadership position.
Hello? Is this 'single working woman with border collie wishes to meet ideal mate?'
Bo Peep got the car and the house.
The Trump Tower contract said they all had to be white.
Yes, we were just in that elevator.  Why?
I love the 'Make Your Own Sweater Kit" you sent me, but it's kind of labor-intensive.
I don't see how I could have roaming charges.
Housekeeping? Can you send up a border collie?
How quickly can I have a Border Collie delivered to Suite 1050?
I’m just hanging out here at Trump Tower with the last remnants of the Trump base.
No Alexa, I said Cheap Hotel!
...a shepherd. What are you going as?
The dog called in sick, so I'm working from home.
Check out channel 12. This idiot woman has a house full of cats.
Tell Trump the Senate Republicans are all here.
I don't know how many.  Every time I start to count them, I fall  asleep.
Yes, I tried counting them. Could you just send up a bottle of Scotch?
What exactly did we do after the bar?
No, the lease says "no dogs or cats."
Mr. President, I 've rounded up what's left of your base.
Yup, we're here watching the Rams game.
Well Mom, coming from someone with 6 cats, that seems a bit hypocritical!
Room Service?  Can you send up more of those little shampoos?
They have names, Karen.
What reason did the condo board give for my eviction?
I don't know how many, I keep falling asleep.
We're just hanging out watching EweTube.
Can I call you back?  I'm right in the middle of a staff meeting.
Just say I'm in a meeting with my staff.
And what's your policy on emotional support animals on this flight?
Us? We’re watching Flocks News.
Medium pepperoni, and twelve mixed green salads...no dressing.
Judge all you want, but since I made the move I haven't lost a single one.
I don't know how many there are. Every time I try to count them I fall asleep.
I don’t know how many. I fall asleep after seven or eight.
I find your ad about a timeshare with a pastoral scenic view to be misleading.
Silence of the Lambs is on. You should see the looks I’m getting.
I'm surrounded by Trump supporters.
Hello Leader McConnell?  I found your Senators!  They're here in the Trump Hotel!
Yeah, I can talk. I'm working from home today.
I'm looking for a sophisticated border collie that would enjoy working in an urban environment
... not alone, I’m with my staff.
They’ll watch anything except Fox.
I'm quite sure I said a dozen matching sheets.
No, Alexa. I said I need to get some 
S-L-E-E-P!
Where are you Mr. Trump, the Republican Leadership meeting is about to start.
I'm looking for a border collie who's tired of country living.
Fox News. What else would they be watching? They’re sheep!
I'm serious, Mary: Pick up.
Technically they're free range.
Bad news, my landlord just told me to get the flock out of here.
Siri, I said I wanted some SLEEP!
Hello, sleep disorders clinic.
Yeah, sometimes my work follows me home too.
The Christmas sweaters said "some assembly required."
No, I want the hotel manger, not the hotel manager.
Last thing I remember is doing shots with that animal rights activist we met.
As I explained at the front desk, they're service animals. I can't sleep without them!
I'd like to report a lost dog
Hello, Room Service? I'd like one shepherd's pie and 15 salads. Hold the dressing.
Don't know how many.  Each time I count them I fall asleep.
No, I haven't lost them. I'm working from home.
Hi front desk? I asked for a fresh set of SHEETS.
Yes, a border collie and a large pot of coffee. Room 614.
I have no idea how many. Every time I start counting them I fall asleep.
Hello Room Service? Could you send a Border Collie?
Yeah, it's going well. I'm up to 14 followers.
Thanks to millennials and the revival of knitting, I'm living on Fifth Avenue!
Good News! I won the contract to trim the grass in Central Park.
Yes, well they’re demanding a recount.
I either need a therapist or a border collie.
Seven-hundred square feet is considered free-range in New York.
I’m watching EweTube.  How about you?
Actually, I’m a sheep hoarder.
I need a large bottle of Ambien and a border collie.
Okay, I rounded up a handful of Trump supporters, now what?
Yes we rent them to insomniacs. How many do you need?
I'd move to the country, but I hate to give up the rent control.
It's great dad ... they created a new position and gave me my own staff.
I guess we'll just hang out until the cows come home.
The ad said no cats or dogs.
Not sure how many. Every time I go to count them I doze off.
The coop board told me to take them to a farm and I did that yesterday--so today I will see if they like the museum.
Room Service. Send up a Border Collie, please.
Well, it worked doctor, but now I have a different issue.
No, I don’t know how many there are—if I try to count them I fall asleep.
Hi, I saw your ad and wonder if you only walk dogs.
Yes, I definitely have experience managing a staff.”
Can I call you back?  I'm in a staff meeting.
Know where I can score some grass?
Man, I think this stuff just kicked in...
Yes sir, yes sir, one penthouse full.
No,I'm still awake.
No, I’m her brother, Bob Peep.
The lease is very clear; no cats or dogs.
Oh yeah,I've been sleeping much better lately.
Something with a lawn.
Oh, that’s the most ridiculous story I ever heard...
You’re saying she lives in a giant shoe with HOW many kids?
My landlord said no dogs or cats.
Let Mr. Trump know that I have a lot of his base with me
Oh, believe me, Bo, I know where to find them.
Yes sir, yes sir, I have you down for three bags full.
...yes, and one order of ops-chay am-lay....
I'd like to order a small pepperoni pizza and forty side salads..
When I woke up,they were still here.
I'm in the middle of a staff meeting.
Well, she did get the truck, tractor, land, farm and country house - but you'll never guess what I got away with!
Yes, 3 bags.
I'll have to call you back.  I'm watching the Rams.
No, I ordered LAMPS.
And my staff is absolutely useless.
How many? I don’t know. Every time I try to count them I fall asleep.
Oh, there's huge demand for locally sourced.
We're just hanging out waiting for the Rams game to start.
I'm just watching this show about some crazy cat lady with like thirteen cats.
Yes, customer service, I'd like to return the artisinal knitting kit.
Bo, honey, I'm telling you. I know where they are.
I'm having second thoughts about the whole urban farming thing.
19 big green salads, no dressing, and one cheeseburger.
No, I'm not off. I'm working from home today.
Could you please send up a border collie
Much better, thank you. My old job was herding cats.
No, I don't know how many there are. I keep falling asleep.
No, I'm not sure how many. Every time I try to count 'em I fall asleep.
I don't care if he's Best in Show at Westminster, he's late for work!
I'm telling you, they're  obviously not comfortable watching Wolf Blitzer.
Alexa, count my sheep.
I have the television on. Maybe that's what you're hearing.
Hello? I don't think this is what I meant by 'all natural sleep-aid'
I just feel like my work follows me wherever I go.
I thought working at home would be great, but turns out it stinks.
I relocated to New York City. No...same job.
Well, it was fun for a while. But I'd like to cancel my subscription.
Just watching the Rams. . . and you?
They wanted to watch the Rams' game.
Can you pick up some lint rollers?
I’m herding from home today.
You've been awake how long....we'll be right over.
I  have no idea how many, I keep falling asleep!
You can't sleep?  We'll be right over.
Listen, Bo-Peep, the judge told you, they're mine Tuesdays and every second Saturday.
Ironically, they make it nearly impossible to sleep.
I told that damn Alexa to order me sheets!
I unfriended most of them but they’re still following me.
It pays better than dog walking
That's right Bo Peep, small bills in a plain paper bag.
Sure it’s crazy but I haven’t slept this well in years.
Sorry, I can't make it - I'm in the middle of a staff meeting.
Siri—play Silence of the Lambs.
I feel like I should just go back to Ambien.
I am not a hoarder.....I'm a herder!
They insisted we watch the Rams game.
Hello, Ms. Peep? I'm not sure I can explain this, but I think I have some good news for you.
I don't know what it is Harold, they just love watching Fox News.
She got the house and land, but I managed to win the sheep.
Is the wolf off Wall Street yet?
Yes, this is Mr. Shepard. Is this the customer service department? Thank goodness. Yes, there's been a mistake. The order was for white sheets.
This farm to table gift you sent me sucks.
I'm not sure how many. Every time I count them, I fall asleep.
Listen, Bo Peep, if you get the cops involved, you can kiss your flock goodbye.
I can’t tonight, it’s my weekend with the kids.
Yes, I unplugged the cable box and plugged in again but they didn't go away.
I finally whipped my insomnia, but Marcia's left me.
I'm still getting used to working from home...
If you can be a little more specific, I'll see if he's here.
It’s rent controlled, so I actually don’t pay more than 2 bags full
So what do I do with them when I’m awake?
In hindsight, Melatonin would have been better.
Yes, I can schedule your lawn for Tuesday at 10 am. Will your dogs be inside?
Working from home has been more challenging than I imagined.
Today I'm working from home
Can you tell the president, he has lost some of his base?
No, I gotta stay in -- I brought a bunch of work home with me.
Mary?  I found ‘em.
The Oval Office got all the black ones
I'm not sure how many I have.  Every time count them, I doze off.
Ewe Haul?
Yes, the usual - one small pepperoni pizza and 12 garden salads, no dressing.
Sheets! I said new sheets!
Twelve. I count them every night, and there are twelve of them. Then I drink myself to sleep.
You tell Bo-Peep to wire the money by midnight or she never sees them again.
I hate bringing work home on the weekends.
It’s baa this and baa that. Their negativity is killing me.
Yeah, white as snow. Yep, every where I go.
They want me to tell you they're not stock, they're emotional support sheep,
and they won't be coming back."
Yes, I would like to renew my Ambien prescription.
For some reason, all they want to watch is Fox News.
Yes, I am dressed like a shepherd. What are you wearing?
I just invited the one. You know how they are.
Yes, I'm still awake.
I’d like to order some grass, please...Yes sir, yes, sir, three bags full.
No, honey, I said "flock" - we gotta get the flock outta here
Yes, they've been very understanding of my emotional support flock.
Yeah they are a lot of work, but I’ve been sleeping like a baby!
What is the maximum number of emotional support sheep you allow on a flight?
Eight or nine of them, I believe. I keep falling asleep.
No, still not married - why do you ask?
Not sure if they're all here; every time I try to count them, I doze off.
Yeah, I tried counting sheep. It worked, I just didn't expect them to be here when I woke up...
I said a dozen sheets
They insist on Fox News. Something about wool over your eyes.
I prefer CNN, but they insist on Fox News.
I'd  like to order one shepherd's pie and 24 kale salads, please.
I'm in a leadership position...
Sure the rent is expensive but I’m sleeping a lot better.
I'm calling to report a lost dog.
They are emotional support sheep. I’ve got lots of issues.
Room service? I would like to order 15 Kale salads with no dressing.
Well, you might have included that little detail in the brochure.
Room service?  I said I needed to get plenty of sleep!
Mom, a lot of people work from home these days, I’ll be fine!
No, doc. . .wide awake.  Should I count 'em again?
Hello, Bo? I've found them!
I don't know how many. Every time I try to count I fall asleep.
I can't. I had to bring some work home tonight.
Hey Bo.  So if we're officially through, when are you picking up the rest of your things?
Yes sir, yes sir, two bags full.
OK, they came home. Now what?
No, just one small burger and forty-three large salads.
No, I can't do lunch today.  I'm working from home.
Yeah, we're in town for the manger scene.
I guess it wasn't a dream after all.
Hello Amazon? I think there's been some mistake. I ordered a dozen sheets.
You tell me the insomniac's room number...I send the sheep.
It's like this, Bo-Peep, $25,000 in old unmarked bills or you will never see them again
...good news, Ms. Peep...I found your sheep.
This isn’t quite what I expected when you said farm to table.
I didn’t say, “Get the FLOCK over here” ...
Yes, a BLT and two bales of hay.
Bo Peep. Meet me at Main and Bailey in two hours. Bring $25,000 in small bills. Come alone.
I'll have to re-think this working from home thing.
Yeah, I just arrived at the air baa and baa. It’s perfect.
Yeah, for delivery--a dozen mixed-green salads, no dressing, and a shepherd's pie.
Hello? I'd like to report a missing - well, yes, - he is black but I don't see why that matters.
Kind of a problem. I woke up and they're still here.
We're watching ewe tube.
Twelve green salads, no dressing.
I'll be working from home today.
When you first put me on hold, there were only two sheep in the room.
Working from home. How about you?
Yeah, the State Fair was great. Unfortunately the raffle prize wasn't the Cadillac this year.
No, I can't tell you how many. I keep falling asleep.
It sure beats having an elephant in the room!
Well, they’re sheep!  They like Fox News!
Working from home today. What are YOU doing?
What do you mean, “lost”? It’s my weekend to have them!
Tell Bo-Peep we want small, unmarked bills.
On the upside, I haven't seen a wolf all day.
Not much, just getting in the mood to watch a Trump Rally.
I told Alexa I needed more SLEEP.
Not bad, but the dog's still working on getting the last couple into the elevator.
What comes after "leave them alone and they'll come home?"
Mother, Mary left me.
Hello, Bo Peep? If you want to see your sheep again, listen carefully....
I'm not sure how many....every time I try and count them I fall asleep
A sheep-friendly building and rent-stabilized. Who knew?
Sure he's cunning, but that wolf will never get past the co-op board.
This is the last time I order a wool coat from IKEA.
Lost the farm. Staying with my son and his wife.
Sheets! I asked for fresh sheets!
I wanted a cheap hotel, not a sheep hotel.
I decided to work from home today.
Me?... holding an offsite staff meeting.
Yes we can help treat insomnia.
You always herd the ones you love.
Don't be so dramatic. It's called shared custody and you know where to find them
No...I said “send up more SHEETS”
...and I'll have the shepherd's pie.
Reservation for twelve at Tavern on the Green, please.
I'd like to order ten salads and one pizza, please.
We're just watching "Silence of the Lambs."
I'll be right down. He's my only black one.
how many manger scenes are we looking at?
What size does the sweater need to be ?
Let me call you back, I'm just in a staff meeting right now.
Yes, one medium pepperoni mushroom and a dozen side salads...
So I finally one-upped that urban farmer who lives next door.
...and I wonder why I'm single
But Dad, I have a job.
I think it's time for me to move to greener pastures.
... and do you allow pets?
I couldn't sleep so we're watching a movie.
Yeah, I'm trying out this new “work from home” option
I think I’ve become their emotional support animal.
Yes, I slept just fine, but now I have a different problem.
Wait, so when you texted "Go Flock Yourself," that was a typo?
Hello, front desk?  I'd like to request wake-up service.
No, not that kind of grass...
No, this is her brother Bob Peep; can I take a message?
Just wait until the cows come home.
I don’t know how many. I get to 10 and I’m out.
Yes..I'd like the shepherd's pie. For twelve.
Yes, this is the Shepherd residence.
Me? I’m just at a gathering of Trump supporters.  And what are you up to?
I have a question about the new sleep app.
No problem. We're watching the Rams game.
Yeah. I started with dog-walking and things just kind of took off from there.
We’ve lost our way.
The lease only said no dogs.
I find it hard to relax because my work follows me everywhere."
I apologize, we'll take the stairs next time.
Nothing much — just watching a little EweTube.
I was skeptical at first, but I got to say, I'm really starting to enjoy this working from home thing.
I like the new gig, except when they ask me to take work home.
My lease said no cats or dogs
Tell Mr. Trump I have just arrived with a group of his most devoted supporters and we look forward to meeting him.
Apartment living really IS easier; I haven’t lost a single one.
The lease said no dogs,nothing about sheep.
$500 on the Rams. I have inside information.
Another insomnia case? I'll be right there.
I just want to inquire about how many comfort animals you allow me to take on my flight?
Front desk?  I thought you said "CHEAP ROOM" .
So I decided I'll work from home today..
I would tell you how many, but I might nod off.
Damned if it didn't work.  I left them alone.  They came home.
Not much. Brought some work home with me.
…yeah, the real trick is finding something they all want to watch.
I told the condo board I worked in commodities.
I'm not sure how many there are.  Every time I try to count them, I fall asleep!
The Rams are up by 3 points; you wouldn't believe the tension in the room.
I'm not sure if it's from the counting or the tending, but I'm definitely sleeping better.
No, not "you", I said I have a problem with "ewes".
About how big is each dinner salad?
I'm working from home today.
The sheep didn't work Doc...couldn't I just take an Ambien?
I’d like to order twelve salads to go.
That's 11 large salads, hold the feta...
Hi, I’m calling to reserve a ewe-haul.
No, I said I could use more _sleep_.
That’s right — a large cheese pizza and a border collie.
It's honestly far superior to urban beekeeping.
Well, I told them the grass wasn’t always greener but they wanted to see for themselves.
This isn't working. I need to go back on Ambien.
I'm actually not sure how many I have, I keep dozing off around 10.
Yeah, I'm stuck spending the holiday with Trump supporters too.
I know, I  know -- gotta stop bringing my work home with me.
No, no, Genie.  I said I wanted a CHEAP apartment.
Hello, Tavern on the Green? I'd like to reserve just the Green for dinner tonight.
It always seemed unfair that I got to see where they live but they never got to see my place.
They’re my emotional support flock.
Can't.  I'm watching the Rams play tonight.
I think sleeping pills may have been the more practical option.
That’s right, 3 fish tacos, a diet coke , and 50 bales of hay.
Every time I try to count them I fall asleep
Yes sir... yes sir.  That is correct....two bags full
Actually, they let me work from home.
Sometimes you just get a sudden craving for twelve sheep, and I guess that's the danger of Amazon Prime
You never listen to me. I said I wasn't getting enough SLEEP.
Not as well as I'd hoped, actually. I'm going back on Ambien.
I counted, I slept, now what?
Yes, i placed the ad looking for a border collie who could work an elevator
Yes sir, yes sir, free shipping with three bags full
Turns out, it's much easier than walking dogs and I've never slept better.
That’s right, I’m working from home today.
Bo-Peep here. You wouldn’t believe where I found them.
What specific home owners regulation are you referring to ?
Please send up a Border Collie.
Nothing much, just at home watching 
Ewe-Tube
Fortunately, there was a sheepdog on the co-op's board - he voted us in.
I'm just watching the game with some other rams fans.
It's a lot easier now that I have my own place.
The good news is, I'm off the Ambien.
Yes, doctor, I already tried that.  Will you PLEASE just renew my Ambien prescription?
A hamburger, fries, and 12 bales of clover.
Fine so far, the escalator was a bit of a problem.
You said no dogs.
Yes, I read the lease, but technically sheep aren’t pets.
Your profile mentions knitting as a hobby?
Hi, Bo Peep?  I have them.
It's a little less space than we're used to.
Just chillin'.  Watching the Rams game.
Yes, I think I'm highly qualified to be head of the GOP.
... yeah, they all wanted to watch the Rams, so I just brought them back to my place.
Hello? Rent-a-Border-Collie?
I requested new sheets.
I left them alone and they came home, just like you said.  Now what?
No, that's it, just the one case of mint jelly.
Well, first we moved to greener pastures, and it just sort of snowballed from there...
Yep, I took them to the zoo. And tomorrow we’re seeing Hamilton.
I don't know how many. I keep falling asleep when I count.
You know it's the same old bah, bah, bah. How about you?
Sure I’m falling asleep faster, but what do I do with them during the day?
Cannabis hotline?...how long does it take for edibles to wear off?
The wolf of Wall Street? I've got the deal of the decade here for you.
It's 2018, of course I can work from home.
Are you saying one of these has to be a wolf?
Mom, I need you to understand.  If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.
Well, it depends on how you define "free-range"
And then I heard about vertical farming.
I was tired of herding cats.
Trouble falling asleep? Hmm. Ok. How many would you like?
Well, if this doesn't cure my insomnia, I don't know what will.
Yeah, I found ‘em.  They got a nice, little sub-let  in Queens.
I hate it when work follows me home.
Bo Peep?  Little Boy Blue here. I found them.
OK--so I've counted them.  Now what??
I must have nodded off again.
But *everyone* works from home now.
Yes, that's right:  twelve bushels of hay, a burger and a shake."
What is your policy on emotional support herds?
Dog walking was nowhere near this complicated
Yes, I counted them.
Who knew so many people in Manhattan needed a sheepwalker?
I’m not sure if this work from home thing is sustainable.
I give up sweetheart- bring my sleeping pills.
I got the shepard's hook, the outfit, and the sheep, and we're waiting in your apartment -- where are you?
I unfriended them but they’re still following me!
No, plural.
What do you mean, try Ambien?
I had to work from home today.
Of course the rug is Nylon. Do you think I want to upset them?”
Just tending the flock.  What are you doing?
That's right, a pair of wool shears, and 20 cases of carpet stain remover.
Look Buster! We came all the way to New York for the nativity scene gig.
I just feel like my work follows me home"
They calmed down once I turned off Wolf Blitzer.
Yes, could I have the number of the little boy that lives down the lane?
He can't fall asleep?  I'll be right there!
Yes, cancel the Ambien prescription. I'm going to try a natural approach.
Actually, I work from home.
Oh nothing, just watching the Rams.
Why me?  Because everyone else in the Department of Agriculture was fired.
I thought, For a change, Why don't I just follow them?
I brought some work home with me.
We're just hanging out and watching the Rams game.
They said that I could work from home.
Yeah, there are fewer side effects than Ambien, but I don't know if the upkeep is worth it.
I told you I was working from home today.
Mom, plenty of people work from home.
What's that? You can't sleep? OK we'll be right over.
Nothing, it’s just the TV.
Now the only thing lost is the remote.
House sitting at Bo-Peep's place. You?
No, no, no.  Sheets...I need extra SHEETS
Bo?  It’s me. Have you lost anything?
I said, "I can't SLEEP without a fresh set of SHEETS!"
Somehow I thought moving to the city would be a bigger change.
Can't sleep?  Come on over.
Ok guys, NYPD says the wolf is in custody!
Hey man, got any grass?
Sendup a burger, french fries. and 12 salads, hold the dressing.
They just followed me here. You know what they're like.
Yes, I'm their emotional support animal.
Friday is work from home day.
Yeah, I'm working from home today.
On Fridays the ranch lets me work from home.
They won't let me put on Fox.
But can you describe the sheep you lost?
I'm looking for a sheep dog that is not afraid of heights
Mary's at her yoga class. Can I take a message?
Yeah it’s inconvenient but I’ve been sleeping great.
No--so far they've been holding it in
I'm shepherding from home today.
Yeah. I found them. We're here at the Trump Tower.
Nothing much How are the cows
Not sure how many now. I tend to nod off when I try to count them.
But on the positive side, I'm sleeping better.
You were right Mother.  I left them alone and they came home.
Yes, a cheeseburger medium rare, a glass of scotch, and 45 pounds of clover”
No, I'm not sick. Just working from home today.
Hello, Is this the wolf of Wall Street?
You have the wrong number; this is the lamblord, not landlord.
Oh, ya know,mostly ....just tending to things.
Yes Mr. President your followers are assembled as you directed.
Turns out there’s not much of a market for sheep in the city that never sleeps.
I must have misheard her. Apparently she said "Go to room 514 if you wanna flock."
Just to give you the heads up, I'll be working from home today.
I actually think I'm more productive when I work from home
I'd like to switch back to Ambien, please.
They said I have to pay extra for roaming
You'll have to ask one of the other shepherds. I'm working from home today,
Listen, Peep, you'll get your sheep when I get my cash.
You never want to come over anymore.  It's the cane, isn't it?
Bo? Found ‘em.
Oh, and I've been sleeping great.
How should I know?  Every time I try to count them, I doze off.
No, that's the problem. They all think for themselves.
Yeah,we're working from home today.  Try calling our field office.
...and thirty side salads.
Siri, call wolf.
Yeah...they let me work at home two days a week, and I'm in the field the other three.
It didn't work; better send up some Ambien.
Haven't slept in a week? My associates and I will be right over.
Send more sheep...I'm still awake!
Well, we got kicked out of Botanical Garden today, otherwise the trip's been great.
That whole follow the star of Bethlehem thing didn't work. I ended up in downtown Cleveland.
Yeah, I'm back in the city, but I brought some work home with me.
Room service? I need grass, a lot of grass- no, no,not pot.
Just let her know I found them.
I was tired of being sheepless in Seattle.
No, it's ok,  I can talk.  Just wrapping up a staff meeting.
Insomnia in room 34? I'm on it.
On Fridays I shepherd from home.
About that lawn mowing job?
Me? Not much. Watching some EweTube.
Remember? Fridays I work from home.
...I got to 12, fell asleep, and in the morning they were still here.
Great news, we just signed a long term contract with the sleep clinic.
Sure, you can try the sleep meditation app; but we're here in the building. We can be there in ten minutes.
Predictably, they just want to see Times Square
I thought you said get the flock back to the apartment and bring the staff.
The price was right and there's a garden on the roof."
Bo, you left some of your stuff at my place...
I thought you said this would help me sleep.
Fourteen. How many did you get?
Do you have outdoor seating?
Quiet guys, it’s our agent about the Rockefeller Center Nativity
A rack of lamb medium rare; but could you deliver them in an unmarked container
I don't hear it. Must be on your end.
I'm telling you, Herb, if you start watching the knitting channel you'll go all in like I did.
He’s still awake? Sure, I can send another herd, but these are my best jumpers and that’s overtime plus time and a half.
We're just going to watch the herding dog competition and then have a snack in central park.
Nope, I'm working from home today.
No. I tried it. I still can't sleep.
They're not lost they're having a sheep over
They said pets were okay.
Yeah I’m not feeling great. I thought I’d work from home today.
"You have 24 hours to come with the ransom, Ms. Bo-Peep "
Your ad for a private Peep Show was totally misleading.
Yeah, I'll be working from home today.
Nothing much--just been catching up on my sheep.
Sorry mom the job options are pretty limited when you have a degree in biblical studies...
I did.  Twelve.
My border collie is on vacation. The temp service sent me a bichon frise who keeps herding us to the upper west side.
Okay, play date in Central Park.  We'll met you there.
Working from home, why?
Yes, well they’re as confused as I am.
I don't know.  I fall asleep every time I try to count them.
No, I said I wanted a room where I could get a ton of SLEEP.
I said, I wanted a room with a view...not a room full of ewes.
I think I misunderstood how Pay Per Ewe works.
I'm going to be working from home today.
He was already asleep when we got here. Do we still get paid?
Will someone be a lamb and get me a beer?
QVC...I'd like to order a border collie.
We've got nativity scenes in all five boroughs.
Room service, I'd like to order the L-A-M-B chops.
I’ve started working from home.
Bo's not here.  I'm just the sitter.
On reflection, there were probably more practical sleeping-aids on the market.
Okay, tonight I'll try melatonin instead.
I thought you said “go home and get some sheep”
The pay isn't great, but they let me work from home.
I told the hotel I had some emotional support animals
Can’t talk now, I’m at my sleep therapy session.
Can I call you later? I’m about to take a nap.
Room service? Yes, hello Gwynneth, when I asked for a sleep aid,I had something a little different in mind.
Urban farming sounded a lot more glamorous than it is.
It takes “farm to table” to a whole new level.
They were here when I woke up.
We used to be abiding in the fields, but then I found out that calling them "emotional support sheep" would get us into a hotel.
Hello concierge, I’d like to know more about “farm to table” dining...?
Yes, the sheep are watching Fox News again.
I'd like the unlimited roaming bundle.
...one turkey club...and thirty-seven sides of kale...
It's sleep you idiot, I need lots of SLEEP.
Yes, we can do the lawn and provide organic fertilizer all at the same time.
The condo board's gonna change their minds when they each get three bags full!
Thanks, but I think we're gonna stay in and watch the Rams game.
Mom, this whole 'urban farming' thing just isn't working out for me.
Can you believe it? My landlord made me get rid of my sheep dog.
Maybe moving my business to the city wasn’t such a good idea.
But now that's it morning, what do I do with them?
I’m the only one here rooting for the Rams.
Hi, it’s Bo, I’m not feeling well and will be working from home today...
Not much. Just waitin' for the Rams game to start.
It's called urban farming, Linda.
room service?  one continental breakfast and a border collie
Don’t worry Mary. She’s here
Siri, where is the meadow?
No, I'm still awake. I think they have to be jumping over a fence.
Yeah, this is the last time I order a merino sweater from the DIY network.
Listen up, Bo Peep. You get me ten grand in unmarked bills by noon tomorrow or they're all mutton, Got t?
Well, how do you feel about pets?  Would that be a deal breaker?
They don’t miss the coyotes, of course. But they do find the wool carpets kinda creepy.
It's chaos here because the building doesn't allow dogs.
Yes ma’am. An actual wolf is at my door.
It takes four dogs to get them all in the same subway car.
Sorry, I can’t talk right now. I’m watching Silence of the Lambs.
No, this is Moe Peep.
Bob thanks, counting sheep did help me sleep last night, but what do I do with them during the day...?
I don't know how many there are.  I'm trying to stay awake.
No, no, no. I don't sell them - I'm a sheep hoarder.
Room service? I'd like the shepherd's pie, please.
City that Never Sleeps, eh? We'll see about that.
No, I asked Alexa for a cheap wall clock, not a sheep wool flock.
Me? Oh, not much, mostly staring out my window and gathering wool"
I think you'll find I do have plenty of followers.
Yes, that’s right.  I’m holding for Ms. Peep.
I don't get out as much since I've been working from home.
Is the rooftop open for grazing?
The landlord has no say. They’re licensed as Service Sheep.
Nothing, really. Just hanging with my Peeps.
I fell asleep counting sheep and when I woke up they're still here
Well, I've seen New York. Now I'd just like to get the flock outta here.
Good news, Bo.
I guess you were right, Mom.  Some job-skills just don't transfer well to an urban environment.
They wanted to see "Silence of the Lambs"
For this afternoon, we have four votes for the Guggenheim and nine votes for Central Park.
Yes, I took the sleeping pills, but they're still here.
I invited some friends over to watch the Rams' game.
And the worst part is they only want to watch animal planet.
Oh, hey...Bo! Yep, it was my day to pick them up. Sorry about the confusion.
If you don't mind I'm going to work from home today.
Leave your message when you hear the bleat.
They couldn't sleep either, so we are all watching TV in your condo.
No, I said send them to my work address
Yeah, sometimes I tend to take work home with me.
Hello, room service?  Send up one vodka martini and eleven shots of wheatgrass.
You're underpricing the sweaters.  This wool was raised on Park Ave.
Ms. Peep? I can tell you where to find them.
They are Emotional Support Animals:  I count them to fall asleep.
Oh, nothing really...just watching EweTube.
Yes, so I've received the sheep but I'm calling in regard to the goats.
Yeah, I decided to work from home today.
Yeah, I’m working from home today, why?
Listen Peep, if you ever want to see them again, be at the barn at midnight.
Good Shepherd House Sitting, may I help you?
I don't know how many there are. Every time I try counting them I fall asleep!
Please leave your message after the bleat.
Miss Peep? I have some good news.
No. They wouldn’t let me into Central Park without a roll of plastic baggies.
I know the lease specifies no pets; these are clients.
In the long run it's cheaper than Ambien.
They found me.
Yes, Bo's going to be fine. It's just a staff infection.
No, I won't say "sheep-sitter" three times.
Clearly I misunderstood, insomnia is now the least of my problems.
I had to accept the fact I was done herding cats.
It’s going to have to wait, Melania. I’m meeting with my base.
I hate bringing work home.
No, I asked for free shipping.
Uh Oh, I thought your message said get some sheep tonight.
Hi Doc, on second thought I think I’ll go with the Melatonin.
Yes, this is Natural Sleep Aids.  How may I help you?
No, it didn’t help counting them. Now what?
I ordered grass.  Why do you keep calling it weed?
Hello Seattle, are you sheepless?
I counted them before bed, but they were still here when I woke up.
Ok, I'm awake.  Now what do I do with them?
Yes, clear my schedule, I´m working from home today.
You would like to order three bags full, no problem.
Hi, yes, my name is Jerod Hanson, and my order number is 867329. Well,  it seems we have a mix up. You see, I ordered a set of sheets...Hello??
Bo-Peep,it's Dad. I found them.
If things get out of hand, I'll put on "Silence of the Lambs."
They show up every time I watch FOX news.
Boss, it's Tom.  I overslept.
We’ll be right over.  Right now we’re watching EweTube.
I don't take my work home with me, it just seems to follow.
Where’s that border collie I ordered?
What I said was, I'd get you a room for CHEAP!
Guess what they don't allow on The Sheep Meadow....
Honey, just a heads-up, I brought some work home.
The listing said 'no kids', so we left the goats at home.
No, no, the room service has been great but we will need housekeeping up here soon!
Hello, Bo?
What do I do if they followed me ALL the way home?
Just to let you know that I'll be working from home today.
My therapist told me I was far too literal and suggested I try counting sheep.
I left them alone, and they came home, bringing their tails behind them. How they made it up the elevator I'll never know.
I thought I signed up for a sleep study not a sheep study.
Yes, I’d like to report a fleecing.
Hello? Ms. Peep? I think I have something that belongs to you.
Next time I'd just like a room with a ewe.
I hate auto-correct. How was I to know you meant sheets?
How did I become the leader of the #EweToo movement?
I doubt the wolf can get past our doorman
Doc, you gotta give me something to stop the bleating!
You know, I thought "work from home" would be more relaxing...
It's hard to tell how many I own - every time I count I fall asleep.
The rent's more than I wanted to pay, but it's nice to be so close to the Park.
You heard right: one veggie pizza and twelve sides of clover.
All I think about is ewe.
She may be using her maiden name, Bo Peep.
Watching the flock by night is much easier now that we have cable.
So have they caught the Wolf of Wall Street yet?
I really got fleeced on this airbnb.
But it’s the counting that keeps me up.
Why yes,we are watching EweTube...
Hold on, I'm getting another bleat
My lease says no pets, but I’m not losing any sleep over it.
Hello room service. Would you send up a Border Collie ?
That’s twelve fresh 
wild green salads delivered to the Shepherd apartment.
Not much, just working from home today.
No Thanks, we're gonna stay in and watch EweTube!
I told you, I already counted the sheep. Now they’re keepin’ me up.
I"d like to sell my stock options.
I said views, not ewes!
Well, yes, but there is an upside.  I've stopped having trouble falling asleep.
I have no idea. Every time I try to count them, I pass out.
I don't feel as motivated working from home.
I’m trying to relax, but my work keeps following me home.
Yeah, I found them.  They were watching Netflix.
I don't know doc, I might prefer just taking Ambien.
My only concern is that that they might try to fleece me.
So am I to understand that Alpine Meadows Apartments has no alpine meadows ?
Yes sir. Yes sir. Three apartments full.
You Tell Little Bo Peep I'm willing to make a deal now."
About a dozen followers... how about you?
I still can't get to sleep.  Do you think I need more sheep?
Still awake...could you send up another dozen?
They don't seem to like cooking shows.
Found 'em.
Hi Bo? Yep, I found them
I'm sorry, I overslept.
No, I herd ewe—that’s the problem.
Hey Bo. No worries. I said I wanted to watch the Rams and they all just followed.
Actually, Mary, I do have a question about your airbnb rental.
Relax, Bo, I found them. They’ve got an Airbnb in Manhattan.
I got a bit carried away at the farmer's market
Yes, it has been an adjustment to move to the city but I do have my sleep aids.
Yes, I'm on the lam!
We'll have the salad.
What makes you think I miss the ranch?
Yes, you heard me right. I need 3 pounds of hay, 3 pounds of barley and a double cheeseburger, no fries.
No sir. I have not lost my mind. I have lost my way.
Ok. Let's see. There's one, two, umm.... Zzz...
I get so much more done when I 'm working from home.
Hey Mary, about last night...
Oh, is the big game on? I'm out in the field with the sheep, they're fine."
We're here until the cows come home.
Sure, it’s risky, but it’s our last chance to catch the wolf of Wall Street.
I was able to fall asleep last night, but now what should I do with all the sheep?
So bring home some garlic,rosemary,and olive oil. I've got the rest.
Don’t worry about my end, you got the mint jelly?
Yeah, I found ‘em. Always the last place you look.
Got us all in one hotel room, but I had to pull the wool over their eyes.
The sign specifically said 'No Dogs.'
I don't care if the collie needs a mental health day, I've got reservations at 7 and someone has to cover!
No, I was not aware of the “you count ‘em, you keep ‘em policy”
I like to travel light, so I'm only bringing my carry-on and my emotional support animals.
Yeah, it's not working.  I'm still awake.
Yes. I know that dogs and cats aren't allowed in the building.
Could I interest you in three bags full?
Jim’s sleeping service, how may I help you?
I tell you, nothing beats working remotely.
Would you please tell Rachel to stop describing the Trump administration as a bunch of sheep? She’s hurting their feeelings.
So this is what restore mode does on the new washing machine
I've gone above and beyond, Doc, and I still can't sleep.
I was out of ambien.
As it turns out, it's alot easier to control Trump supporters than I thought.
What are your policies on working from home?
Business is great. A lot of people in this town have trouble sleeping these days.
Overqualified for the Nativity," my ass
Yeah, they helped me fall asleep but now what do I do with them?
Hang on a second: I think the wolf is at the door.
I love this new job. The boss lets me work from home on Fridays.
...just watching TV, but I keep falling asleep. Dunno why.
A little problem checking in but they qualified as emotional support animals.
She took the kids, but I've got the lambs.
I DID leave them alone. They still came home, wagging their tails behind them!
If you're out of divey, do you have any doats?
We're just settling down to watch a RAMS game.
Yes, the sheep are with me, and the cows are in the corn.
These days I mostly work from home.
Longtime herder, first-time caller...
Bo Peep here.  Found them.
Working from home has been challenging.
I’m not buzzing you in, you still sound like a wolf.
And I still can't sleep.
Janet, I'm working from home today.
I counted them, now what?
I have to change the channel when Wolf Blitzer comes on.
No, not much, just tending my flock...and thou?
Just a little ewe tube...
Ok, I can admit we’re lost.
Well the landlord said no cats.
I mean actual grass. I just need real grass.
One pepperoni and cheese and 30 salads.
Other than the daily trek to Central Park for grazing, it's a pretty good pet sitting gig.
They're settling in quite well; but still a little spooked by "Fox" news.
You say you can't sleep? What's your address?
Hello, yes, this is Little Boy Blue. No, the sheep aren’t in the meadow.
So apparently, ‘Silence of the Lambs’ really freaks them out too.
I'm working from home these days.
I'm housesitting for Mary.
For the last time this is NOT BO-Peep and I know exactly where all my sheep are
Yes, I'd like to file a complaint. No one told me they would still be here when I woke up.
Staff meeting.
They wanted to come indoors and watch Fox news to see what our President was telling them to do next.
Yeah can I get a General Tso’s Chicken and fourteen salads?
I'd like to inquire about the reward money offered by Little Bo Beep.
You know how it is. One of them gets into Game of Thrones and then ALL of them wanna watch Game of Thrones.”
Mary, pick up! We need to talk.
Amazon is next day shipping a border collie.
Hanging with the flock. You?
No, no Mom: URban shepherd. Yes, it’s a thing.
Actually, they found me.
Yo Bo Peep,call me ASAP
I think I'll try Melatonin.
Hello, Good Shepherd Hospital? I'd like to speak with someone in Purchasing.
I'm not sure how many there are I keep falling asleep before I finish counting them.
Just watching “silence of the lambs”...you?
It’s more of a working vacation.
How do I order "The Silence of the Lambs" ?
No, they actually keep me awake.
Your mother and I are concerned, that's all, Bo.
And then I woke up...
Where do you live and what time do you want to start falling asleep tonight?
Bo Peep?  I found them!
It all starts with one little lamb and then 30 years later you ask yourself, "Where did Mary go?"
Mom you were right, the city is no place for me.
No, I'm not in a relationship with any of my roommates--well, maybe one.
Of course it's hell crossing 42cd St. and Times Square but I've never slept better in my life.
Ms. Bo-Peep?  I think I found something of yours.
Urban shepherd, how may I help?
Mom, you were the only one that believed I could make it in the city.
I’m more of a sheep hoarder.
It's not ewe, it's me.
Yeah, well how many real followers do you have?
I'm herding remotely today.
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me but the sheep gotta go.
No mom, I don't know how many.  When I try, I just fall asleep.
what do you mean, "not literally"?
I’ve already tried that, and I still can’t sleep!
No, I lost count when I fell asleep.
A dozen mixed green salads and one lamb chops to Room 357 please.
I work from home today.
This isn't the first time the cable company has fleeced me.
Big teeth, hairy, trench coat and fedora?   No, don’t let him in.
Front desk? Thank you for your thoughtfulness, but I said I need some sleep after a rough day.
It may be a hallucination but it helps me sleep
yeah, I'm working from home this week...
No, I said I'm a sheep hoarder not a sheep herder...
Bo? Yes, they’re here.
What makes you think I’m working from home?
Room service. I’m having trouble falling asleep.Could you send more sheep.
No. This is Mr. Peep. She's out Christmas Shopping.
It isn't wild here - but it is woolly.
No, I DON'T have a dog in my room.  I'm trying to tell you that I'm a German shepherd!
Mary? It happened again.
What do you mean you were just being metaphorical?
Well, I don't bring my work home very often.
Thanks, but I'm still can't fall asleep.
I've checked the Condo by-laws and there is nothing about sheep anywhere.
Yeh, I know, but the tax break makes it worth it.
I said to buy STOCK in wool not a FLOCK of wool!
Hello,operator.  I would like to report a lost border collie.
I can’t ever just relax, my work keeps following me home.
Oh, nothing much. Just wool gathering.
It’s great! The only downside to Air B&B is caring for the owners’ pets.
I asked for a room with a view, not a ewe.
I'd like one small pepperoni pizza and three hundred garden salads.
Oh, no no no! I really love the DIY sweater kit. It’s a great gift.
What do you mean my border collie got himself a separate room?
Actually, they’re very independent politically.
...Oh, and a dozen sides of grass.
The ad said pets welcome.
I left them alone and they came home, but I’m damned if I know how they dragged their tails to the 32nd floor.
No, I had to bring work home with me again.
I already called room service. Apparently grass isn't legal here.
The view is great.  Also, you're out of sprouts.
I'm just not sure this whole working from home trend is for me.
Bo Peep, B-O, P-E-E-P. Tell her the babysitter has to leave.
Ah, you know... same sheep, different day.
I told you they go everywhere I go.
I'm sorry, did you just tell me to get the "flock" out of the apartment?
Good. Ewe?
I decided to work at home today.
Hey Bo, you left some stuff at my place.
Yes, we’ve moved to higher pastures.
Yeah I think i'll take the Ambien now, this ain't working
The Powerball win hasn't changed me at all.
I've decided to work from home for a while.
Just got in town. We’re staying in an Air bah-and-bah.
I took your advice. I left them alone and they came home wagging their tails behind them.
Yes, and a bucket of mint jelly.
Yes, I understand, but I thought the grass would be greener here.
The condo board can drop dead.  They knew our family name was "Peep" when they approved us.
They won't go outside--they've heard about the wolf of Wall Street.
I told Siri to go to 'Sleep' mode, but it got lost in translation.
It didn't work, I still can't sleep.
YES I'M AWAKE! I tried everything.
I actually prefer this dream to the one where I get to work and realize I forgot my pants.
We're binge watching Netflocks
Hello, Little Bo Peep?
I think I found them.
Hi Boss, I'll be working from home today.
I'm calling about your roaming fees
We made it to the hotel by hook and by crook.
I need a Border Collie.
Well, they said it works better than Ambien.
I'm telling you, just leave them alone and they'll come home.
I’m not sure how many. I keep falling asleep when I try to count them.
Of course I’m alone. There’ll never be another ewe.
You can take them away now, I'm awake.
Yeah, sometimes I have to bring home some work
My lawyer says don’t move until the border collies arrive.
12, but who's counting?
Peep here.  You won't believe where I finally found them.
Alexa, I said SLEEP not sheep
Do you deliver grass? No, real grass; the green kind.
No, not a sheep hoarder, a herder, a sheep herder.
Your doorman is super uptight.
I don't care if it exceeds my deductible, I would prefer some actual sleeping pills.
No! I said I wanted lots of sleep tonight!
Not much, just watching the Rams game.
Yes, that’s right - twelve emotional support animals. They work as a team.
The way I figure -- I should be asleep by now.
No, I said "I'm getting the flock out of here, the FLOCK..."
With Amazon Prime, I got free shipping
I'm not sure this farm-to-sofa movement is gonna take off.
Good news honey, I got the job!
No I don't keep an exact count, I tried that once and fell asleep on the job.
Acme Sleep Services.  May I help you?
Not counting the sheep, it's just me and my staff.
-In my defense, they are certified "emotional support animals".
If by lost you mean disconnected from the land, and living on the 14th floor in the upper east side, and watching Fox, MSNBC & CNN all day long, then yes, lost.
Does it really matter how many?
No, just the mint jelly."
Yeah, it’s like Uber for insomnia.
It's not a party, it's a staff meeting.
Oh, just abiding. And you?
It's OK, they're comfort animals.
....oh nothing. Just watching the dog show with some friends from upstate.
They offered flexible working hours and the possibility to work from home...
Hi, do you have "Silence of the Lambs" on pay-per-view?
They seem to prefer Wolf Blitzer to Fox News.
Not much, just counting sheep, how about you?
No Mom, I'm sleeping fine now.
It's 2018 mother......they identify as  sheeple.
Getting sleepy. I need to go now.
It hasn't been the same since the sheepdog won the lottery.
Yes, they're definitely locally raised.
Yeah, and I'm still wide awake.
Miss Peep? I found them!
The good news is that I no longer have insomnia.
I swear it's better than ambien...
Well my insurance didn't cover the sleeping pills, so we've been trying alternative medicine.
Lost a ram transferring at 14th, but otherwise fine. How was your commute?
I would like a wake up call when I am done counting.
I got the room through Air-Baa-n-Baa.
Well yes, Henderson, you do start with a little lamb. But that seven percent annual return really starts to kick in down the line.
Can't tell if it's insomnia or if my work followed me home again.
You won't believe who I went home with last night.
I found them.
Tried that. I still can’t sleep.
So my psychiatrist said, try counting sheep
Yes, I am working from home today
Good Morning, City Sheep Sitter Services
Nothing much.  Just watching the Rams.
I don't think I can make Bethlehem
So if I say the items do not match the description will I get free return shipping?
How can a field be on backorder?!
I'M  TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

I JUST WOKE UP AND I AM STILL COUNTING SHEEP.
I can't now, I'm in the middle of something.
Yea, they were all here when I woke up
I always knew I had leadership potential.
More like Airbnbaa.
And then I thought, what better training for being President?
Yes , I understand this is a much more natural method but honestly, a sleeping pill is just so much easier.
They weren't listening. I said the Lord is their shepherd, not me.
Just waiting for the cable guy. I'm working from home today.
I'm definitely sleeping better, and the only side effect is manure.
Yes Ms. Peep, I’ve found them.
Thanks for trying, Room Service, but I still can’t sleep.
When she asked me to take care of her pets,
I had no idea who she really was.
You know how it is, if you don't get it done at the office you take it home.
The lease said "no dogs."
Finders keepers, Bo Peep.
Just watching Ewe Tube. You?
Leave a message at the bleat
There are too many to count. I keep falling asleep.
...but on the bright side, at least I'm sleeping better lately.
The black one's missing again.
I'm just going to do a head count and then fall asleep.
Well, I gotta get the flock out of here.
You're just gonna have to take my word on it, I'm not counting again
Not much. Just gathering wool.
Yes he's right here, I'll put him on.
The hardest part was getting them into the elevator.
It's just until they find the wolf
Thank goodness there are still some things you can count on.
We got a little lost, and I’m afraid we ended up at the wrong Dakota.
Did I tell you I'm working from home now?
Yep, first time in the Big Apple.
Nope, got it through Airbnb.
The listing said “Pets ok” so I jumped on it.
Can you stop at the store on your way home? We need a bottle of Woolite.
I told Little Bo that if she wants them, she knows where to find me.
Hello I'm calling about the meadow
Seriously, the hook makes all the difference.
I'm taking farm-to-table to a whole new level.
Yeah, the're still voting for Trump.
I'm telling you, nothing herds them better than Fox News.
I can’t complain—it’s a reverse commute.
Yes, my sheep has come in.
I thought you said this was a cheap hotel.
No, tried that. Still awake"
I'm livin' the dream!
Yes, this is Trump Rally headquarters.
No, Mr. Landlord, YOU get the flock out of here!
but on Airbnb you said there were lots of places to 'graze' within walking distance!
Alexa, reorder hay.
I said SHEETS!
Bo? Bob. You missing anything?
Oh... I should have met you at the hill-town, not the Hilton? Are you sure? We kind of like it here...
Yes. A sheep dog. Named Leonard. He was last seen chasing squirrels around the Central Park Carousel.
No, that's TWO bales of clover and ONE pastrami on rye.
So, they're all counted, now what?
And I said to the boss, "This is the last time I take my work home with me!"
No, I'm not sick.  I just thought I'd work from home today.
We are waiting for Trumps speech to come on Fox
Mary, I found them.
Yes, the usual. Shepherd’s pie. Thanks.
Yeah, we're on the lam.
Oh ... I should try counting IMAGINARY sheep.
The view is nice, but "park access" is a bit of an overstatment.
A border collie? Nah, the lease says no dogs...
I trust you, doctor, but I really think Ambien would have been easier.
No, I'm not in the North Pasture.  I told you I was working from home today
What's up? I'm herding from home.
Can you get the rest of my Republicans up here?
Siri, call Bo...tell her I’ve located her sheep.
The silence of the lambs is even creepier than I remember.
Yes, ten large wheat-grass pizzas.
When you work from home, though, you're never really off the clock.
The noise? Oh, I’m working from home today”
Do you have any Border Collies with experience in small spaces?
I’m running late. I had to bring some work home with me.
Yeah, I'm working from home now.
That's right, Mr. Mueller, three bags full.
That's right.  They're here. And I've got your silly stick, too.
My parents let me stay at their apartment while I get my artisanal feta business off the ground.
No one warned us about the wolves of Wall Street.
The good news is I fall asleep really quickly.
#EWETOO?
Border collie's at the vet.
I would like a dozen house salads with extra alfalfa sprouts, and a 
L-A-M-B chop.
Urban farming is a lot more relaxing than I thought!
Send up a bottle of Merlot and a case of Woolite
Yes, I've been sleeping a lot better.
Hello Mary, I’ve found your little lamb. She’s been quite busy!
This place gives me the woolies.
It's a 5th-floor walk up. So, that was a whole thing.
I did not bring them.  They followed me.  You know what they're like.
They are free range but not grass fed.
The ad said “Work from Home”
Yeah, but the black one left to see the sights.
No Mom, this is not just a phase.
Cool if I work from home today?
You're right, Mother. My friends do all appear to be sheep.
I'm out of sick days, so my boss is making me work from home.
Dammit, Bo-Peep, if you'd follow me on Instagram, you'd know where they are!
Bo? Get your ass over here.
Oh, nothing. We're just watching ''Babe" again.
Hello, Mary? Yes, I found them.
Sorry, but I can't return them until I refill my Ambien prescription.
My parents told me I had to get a job or move out and now they're still not happy."
I've gathered your next group of cabinet candidates.
Turns out that damn Border Collie has a girlfriend in town.
Yes I can have them there by your bedtime.
No, beekeeping was last week.
No, this is Ewe-ber. With an E.
Do as I say Bo Peep: meet me in the lobby at noon, bring the cash, come alone.
Hello Insomnia Clinic, your advanced reality therapy isn't working.
I assumed the wool would arrive pre-bagged.
I'll never doze off at farmers auction again!
Hi Sid, I’m going to work from home today.
I was exhausted. How was I supposed to know you weren’t being literal?
This place has breathtaking ewes
Actually, my rod and my staff haven’t been much comfort.
They're getting restless. I'm not sure 'Wolf of Wall Street' was a good idea.
Bo Peep?  You'll never guess where I found them.
My boss wouldn't give me the day off, so I'm working from home.
I miss you, too, Bo.
If this doesn't work, I'm taking an Ambien.
Just one more episode, then we'll head back to the fields
I love working from home.
I swear you said "Get the flock out of town!"
For some reason , I just can't stop going to sleep.
Oh, just teaching someone on Airbnb a lesson about mandatory cleaning fees...
Yes, Room Service... I think I'll try that glass of warm milk now...
No, I know the difference between literally and metaphorically.  I meant "literally!"
Let me give it to you straight, Mom -- I've made some terrible investments.
I lost count while I was trying to get to sleep
Look, I'm going to be a little late. It appears that I overslept.
On second thought, ixnay on the ambchops-lay. Send me up a salad instead.
Well, they came with the new mattress and I can't get them to leave!
Hello, I'd like to submit a complaint about my neighbor's barking dog.
I thought that I was just counting them, not bidding on them.
Hey honey, remember when you told me not to bring work home?
Can you help me put together this wool sweater from Ikea?
I  guess it worked, because I must be dreaming.
I’m not sure how many there are.” “Whenever I count them, I fall asleep.
No, I did not say "cheap" apartment
Yeah. It’s an Air Baa-n-Baa.
Ma, stop nagging. I know I'm the black sheep, but I'm  hanging with a good crowd.
I'm asking, how much sheep can a sheep shearer shear if a sheep shearer could shear sheep?
My therapist says I'm a herder!
I said CHEAP.  I was looking for something really CHEAP.
Is there something you should have told me when I sub-leased your apartment, Bo?
I'm in the process of looking for a new field.
We never miss an episode of Graze Anatomy.
Let me call you back...I'm watching the evening ewes.
To get real sleep,  you need real sheep.
No, Doc, I said, “I need some sleep”
Yep, I’m on it. One for the little boy who lives down the lane.
I'll call you back. I've got some Trump voters to take care of.
What do you mean count them in your mind?
I know I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up about urban farming.
Blue? Peep. Small bills in a brown bag. No cops or they're chops.
Well, my roommates and I are very close-knit.
They won't listen to me. I tell them what to do and they say, "The Lord is my Shepherd."
Yup, I left them alone and they came home.
It’s just like living on the farm, only the reception is better.
hello, is Mary there
They're asking for political asylum.  Something about a "big bad wolf" is all that I could get out them.
I need to get the flock outta here.
Yes, I'd like to cancel my subscription...
They insist on watching every Ram's game.
Yeah doc, the trazodone put me right to sleep but I'm not sure I can live with the side effects
Hello, Room Service? We'd like one New York steak, medium rare, and 12 dinner salads.
Hello, I need to return the DIY sweather kit. I guess we have different definitions of do it yourself!
My sleep aid worked at first, but I seem to need more and more.
Send in more sheep, I am still awake
Yeah, the grand prize was a free trip to the city for me and a dozen of my closest friends!
Hey, Ma, New York City is crazy.  They have this place in Central Park called Sheep Meadow, but they don’t allow sheep there!
The sheep aren't working, Doctor. Can't I just go back to Ambien?
I would like to order several hundred pounds of fresh grass, with a side of clover and forbs or whatever you reccomend for a night of light grazing.
We're cramped, but it's a New York apartment...
Granted, it is an unusual gig, but it pays well and is easier than herding cats.
I told you I needed fresh sheets.
One pizza, a bottle of beer, and fifty pounds of hay.
I wish I had thought of this whole telecommuting thing years ago.
Sorry to hang up...but I have to get the flock out of here.
A city this size -  and nobody delivers hay.
This Wolf on CNN... do we trust him?
It's like herding cats, but much, much easier.
Yeah, it seems like everyone who is young and white flocks to the city.
I am afraid you misread the listing. This is a sheep apartment, not a cheap apartment.
I need my Ambien back, this new thing isn't working out.
Bo, it's me.  Give me a call as soon as you can, babe.
No. I said I was watching the Rams!
OK, I've led them to Fox News. Now what?
I'd like a cheeseburger with fries, a large Coke, and two bales of alfalfa.
I'd like to order 3 bales of hay and a large pizza with everything.
I would like to order in from the grazing menu
I work from home Fridays
Hi, Bo Peep? Yeah, I found them.
I'm just about to take a nap.
I think they’re looking for the remote.
I just explained to them that technically these aren't pets.
How do I know you're not a wolf?
The view is great and I have never slept better.
My landlord told me to get the flock out of here.
I’ve only been here a week in the landlord told me to get the flock out of here
A total of 42. Now I've got to go. I'm getting really sleepy.
Bo Peep residence? I have good news.
I told you, I'm at work!
They loved the Met and the Guggenheim but the grass in Central Park wasn’t to their liking.
What do you mean border collies aren't allowed on the twelfth floor?
The condo Rules and Regs say no GOATS
Big Bad Wolf? Don’t buzz him in.
Tried it!
Tried it!
Yeah, tried that too. 
I don’t know, maybe 10 or 12.
What's melatonin?
It was a loud bar. She thought I said "I wanna flock."
No, I don't need a wake up call. I'm having trouble falling asleep as it is.
The dog called in sick today so we're watching "Silence of the lambs" at home.
At first they appreciated not getting eaten by wolves, but now they're always irritated about Netflix outages.
Insomniacs Anonymous?
Hello, room service? Is your grass organic?
Hello Bo Peep?  I have some good news for you!
Actually, I find I'm often more productive when I work from home.
No really, they just followed me home. Hm? Yeah...wagging their tails behind them.
The hard part was getting them up here in the elevator.
So turns out working at home was a bad idea.
Wrong number, "Where the buffalo roam" is in room 650.
Ewe Tube isn't working
It's not the best grazing spot, but it's rent-controlled.
Well, if I have to watch over my flock by night, I might as well be comfortable.
They all wanted to watch "The Wolf of Wall Street."
I hate to bring my work home with me, but it's the only way I can sleep at night.
That’s right, bespoke artisanal sweaters delivered to your door.
It's a staff job, and I get to work from home.
Hello, Mary?  We've got a problem
I started counting them and they stayed the night.
We’re watching ‘Silence of the Lambs,’ how about you?
Silence f the Lambs" but they don't like it
Your Arbnb is full of sheep, sir. 

I SAID SHEEP.
I'd like to make an appointment for 12 haircuts please.
I'm telling you, vertical herding is how we get to the top of the wool business.
I've counted them all, now what?
That's right, one cheeseburger, fries, a coke, and twelve paleolithic kale salads.
I promise! You won’t hear a Peep out of them.
I don't know. They all wandered in here when I turned on Fox News.
No rush to hang up, Mom. I'm working from home today.
OK, I counted them and had a good night’s sleep. Now what do I do with them?
So few apartments have pastures.
We went to Central Park today. The Sheep Meadow was a big disappointment.
Mary, come and get your damn lambs. You know that was part of the divorce settlement.
I'm working from home today. The meadow was packed.
I thought this was my weekend with the kids.
I'm in Brooklyn.  They call everybody "ewes" here.
Yo, Bo, Found Em.
Miss Bo-Peep, just follow my instructions and your sheep will be returned unharmed.
No Miss Peep I can't tell you where to find them.  That's what witness protection is all about.
The landlord told me that I have to get the flock out of here.
Honey!  I had no choice.  I had to get the flock outta there.
Believe me Gloria, this is easier than herding cats.
...can I get clover on that and then a dozen sides of pasture grass...
No, no, you've reached Beau Peep.
The farm is toast. The girls are fine. Guess where FEMA sent us?
Do you know what channel Lassie is on?
How do you turn off the cooking channel? They're about to make lamb chops!
Yes, I think I can help you with your insomnia issues.
I lost count.
Nope, still can't fall asleep.
They only watch when Fox News is on.
Yeah, I like my new job but sometimes I still have to take work home.
Wait a minute, where's the wolf now?
A letter coming from the Home Owner's Association about what?
I know, everyone's flocking to the city these days.
I thought they only followed me on Facebook.
I've got to stop taking my work home with me.
Bo Peep. Jack here. I think I found them.
We thought the Rams were on today.
Fine, if you don't want 'em, I'll sell 'em on eBaa."
You need roommates to afford a city apartment these days.
I'd love to go out, but I'm kind of on the lam.
Got to get off the phone now. I brought a lot of work home tonight.
With the cats, I could never satisfy my herding instincts.
Yes, I fell asleep and slept well, but...
Yes hello, I’d like to cancel my subscription to Net Flocks.
Love ewe, too.
"Yes sir, enough wool for three bags full. Just bring your own bags and shears.
Your website says ‘pet friendly’ but I just thought I’d call.
Bo, I found your sheep... and it's gonna cost ya.
I thought you said a room with a ewe.
The food channel is coming on and I don't want to upset them.
Hi, I'm calling about the Boarder Collie
Same ole...working on boundary issues.
This just isn't working out.  I need to get the flock outta here.
... sure they work, but I think I'd like to go back to the sleeping pills.
Seems like alot for grass. but you deliver?
Hey Siri, Text Bo Peep, "I"ve found  them!
Well, I am sleeping better.
Well, it's like herding cats.
Beef and broccoli. Hot and sour soup. And six bales of hay. Ten minutes? Great!
Working from home isn't half bad-  I tune in to Fox and Friends, and they fall right in line!
I'm all for farm-to-table, but this is ridiculous!
I agree, one of them is a wolf - I'll keep looking.
I'm trying to work from home but I just keep falling asleep
I brought some work home with me again.
No, I have no idea who ordered the movie "Babe" fourteen times
I thought you said I can count sheep to go to sleep, then why am I so awake right now?
Bo Peep please.
Things are actually actually pretty 
Ba-a-a-a -d.
Miss Peep, leave $150,000 in unmarked bills under the Brooklyn Bridge at midnight.
Yeah, we've got a few gigs through the holidays, but then I guess it's out to pasture.
I need to stop bringing my work home with me.
Counting them didn’t help
Three bags? Hell, I have a whole roomful.
We missed the Meadowlands exit.
Yes they did help me sleep, can you come get them now?
I'm taking a course on leadership.
I promised em they could watch "Silence of The Lambs"
No i said a cheap appartement
Yes, Ms. Peep...I think I have found what you lost...can you describe your lost items in detail?
Front Desk, "I would like to order 3 bales of Hay and a shovel, please"
Listen carefully Bo Peep I have your sheep
Yo. Peep here again. Yeah. I found 'em.  Turns out they never even left the apartment.
No, we took the stairs.
If it’s that wolf at the door, don’t let him in.
Yes, sir - yes, sir.  Three bags full.
So far, I’m not a big fan of telecommuting.
Bo Peep?....Yeah, they're at my place.
so we're heading off to bethlehem in the morning
What would Jesus do?
Look, Doc, I'm all for natural alternatives, but couldn't you just prescribe me some Ambien?
Yes, that's one pepperoni pizza and two bales of hay.
Room service? I need some grass.
Wool’s trading for WHAT?!
Evidently the city that doesn't sleep is just the untapped market I've been looking for!
It's me, Bo. You'll never guess where I finally found them.
Very funny, Al. No, I am not sheepless in Seattle.
Hello, Ewe Tube? Have I got a video for you....
Yeah, I took your advice and left them alone . . . and they did come home, but they're still not happy about the location.
Hello, Little Bo-Peep?  Now listen, and listen carefully...
I said only ONE for the little boy who lives down the lane.
Now, what are your roaming charges?
Even though it’s a pull-out, I’m sleeping remarkably well.
That will be twelve large orders of grass, and one kale salad.
It's very simple Ms Peep - it's your money or your sheep.
Is the wolf gone yet?
I didn't get fired, but they are putting me out to pasture.
Rent a sheep to help you fall asleep! Rob speaking. How many sheep do you need?
Honey, the dog had the day off so I brought work home.
No, pretty sure they're trump supporters.
I THINK someone signed me up for a sleep study.
Oh,it's ewe again.
Hello?  Netflocks?
Yeah, I know the there's a limit, but technically they're not pets.
Yeah, you just leave them alone, and they come home.
We can’t go anywhere until I can convince them that the Wolf of Wall Street isn’t an actual wolf.
This is Bob Peep, my wife isn't home.
No one told me that they can't go DOWN steps.
Right. That's one shepherd's pie and a dozen bowls of milk.
No, that was SIX bales of hay and ONE Shepherds Pie.
For some reason Doc, whenever I check to see if they're all here I have trouble staying awake
That's right, Ms. Bo-Peep -- $25,000 or it's mutton time.
You'll never find them, Bo Peep, so pay up if you want them back.
Yes, Miss Bo, we're good. It's halftime and the Rams are ahead.
Thinking about getting the flock out of here.
Hello, room service? I'd like a grilled cheese and seventeen garden salads.
Please send up one order of the chicken stir-fry, two bottles of ginger ale and a border collie.
They said, "count the sheep to fall asleep", but they never said anything about what to do once you wake up.
First of all, I am not little.  Secondly, they are not mine.
Not tonight.  Sometimes I have to bring work home.
Hey, Bo? Found 'em.
I know I'm supposed to lead them somewhere, but I can't risk losing this rent-controlled apartment.
Once they cut both the farm and the rent subsidies, I really had no other choice.
I will say the career change has done wonders for my insomnia.
What do you mean the wolf of Wall Street is a metaphor?
I’m watching Graze Anatomy, how about you?
You say you're holding the black sheep at the border?
I already herd.
Believe me, I've tried non-pharmaceutical methods.
Exactly how soon can we get that farm-to-table reservation?
Working from home is the best decision I ever made.
I've counted them all; what doI do now?
Some hotels are just better than others at helping you get to sleep.
Although the wolf's no longer a problem, the coop board's been threatening me something fierce.
I need a bigger staff.
I was trying to get some sleep and now they just won't leave.
I've tried that and I'm still wide awake.
Yeah, I’ve tried that, but I’m still wide awake.
I overslept.
No, haven’t heard a peep from her; but I do know where she can find them.
I've got something of yours, Peep, and if you play ball , nobody gets hurt.
You're right Dr. Brulov , I've got to stop taking my work home with me.
Bo? It’s me. I found them. What? Leave them alone? Are you sure?
Just wanted to let you know I’ll be working from home again tomorrow.
That's 3 bales of hay, 4 orders of clover, 2 of crabgrass, and a club sandwich.
The hardest part of bringing the work home is staying awake
I really miss working in the field.
Yeah, I brought work home so I can watch the game.
That’s right, I do petting zoos, birthdays, and baaaaat mitzvahs
No, I just left them alone, and ...
Waiting for the LA Rams game. How about you?
I have to stop bringing my work home with me.
Sorry, but I don't think this stay-at-home job is going to work
They wanted horror, so we're watching Wolf of Wall Street again.
Well, I gotta say, apartment sitting is a much more enjoyable side gig for us than that dog-walking one...
This is room 417. Please send up one Shepherd's Pie and an acre of grass.
I want to report a lost border collie, answers  to the name "Scotty"
Nice place, but I’m getting fleeced on the rent.
How do I get ewe tube?
I am giving sweaters for gifts this Christmas...lots of sweaters.
I told them that I would only take the job if I could work from home on Fridays.
Doc, I'm still having trouble falling asleep.
Hello, is this Bo?
Tell Little Bo Peep I found her damn sheep.
We're watching "50 Shades of Graze."  What are you up to?
No, I'm Little Bo pooped.
Siri, I'm not talking dirty. What I asked was in Sheep Meadow was there a flocking fee?
The people downstairs are fine with it. They’ve got llamas.
One order of bun cha and enough lemon grass for 24.
No, I can't sleep either.
Oooooooh, you said a "CHEAP"  hotel room. My bad.
I’d like to cancel a subscription.”
Yes, I'm trying to reach a Ms Peep?
Hello, 911? I’ve been fleeced.
I'm on the wait list for a ground floor apartment.
Mary?
Well, yes...I have tried counting sheep
I just got tired of herding cats.
No.  I have no problem nodding off at bed time.
I said, "With a view," not with a Ewe.
Mary didn't tell me they reproduced this fast.
I'm watching Flocks News right now, can I call you baaack?
I told the office I'm herding from home
Well, funny story, it all started when I couldn't get to sleep...
I seem to have lost count
Yes, my flock is registered by my sleep therapist as emotional support animals.
We're watching the Ram game.
No I don't know the exact number. I fall asleep anytime I try to count them
Oh, just woolgathering...
No, I tried that, and I'm still awake.
Is this Bo-Peep?  I've found them. They're in New York.
Why didn't you tell me about your "No Sheep" policy at check-in??
My therapist says I have herd mentality.
Oh, nothing much. Just house sitting for the Pendletons.
It's smaller than it looked on Airbnb, but it does sleep twelve.
Sorry, we're already booked. Two pageants, one parade, four manger scenes, a reunion with the Brokeback Mountain cast."
Your 'Sleep App' appears to have some glitches."
Just let Bo-Peep know they're here.
Hi Miss Bo-Peep. We have some good news for you.
I'm not sure this working from home trend is for me.
Yeah, been working from home two days a week, but the apartment’s starting to smell like the office.
What should I do with them after I've counted them?
I call it Lambien.
I really need to get the flock out of here.
Sheep happened
Yes. I'd like to speak with Mary.
Apartment to table is my speciality.
Ewe called?
Why do I want to initiate this return? Well, because I feel like I got fleeced.
Yep, I found thy rod, and the staff's all here.
They've been behaving fine, well except when the Serta commercial came on.
Can you come over?  I have to count them and I’m afraid I’ll fall asleep.
A cheese omelette, rye toast, and 8 bales of hay.
I'm sorry, could you re-bleat that?
Yeah, so the dog is gone and I’ve got to get these guys to LaGuardia.
Working from home has been a bit of a challenge, but my insomnia is completely cured."
Working from home. So far so good.
Just chillin', getting my sheep together, what about you?
So I told the desk clerk that they're my support animals.
I have to work from home today. They want to watch the sheep dog trials.
I said I was looking for a 'cheap' apartment.
We are safe now, but those Wall Street wolves are just waiting outside the door.
Look Bo Peep...I told you I could only watch them for a hour!
Tell her I’ve got them.
No, what other way to invest in wool futures?
Pricey, but right near the park.
yes, the airline lost the black one.
Yes, I can definitively say there are no cats in the apartment.
Tell Little Bo Peep I want $5,000 by five o'clock tonight.
What kind of an agent can't get this group a gig on Christmas Eve?
We'd like 12 large salads, no dressing, a double cheeseburger with bacon, a side of onion rings, and a Budweiser.
Yea, well, it's a gig economy, mom.
Management put me out to pasture.
No, I told them I want to get some SLEEP.
Hey Bo your peeps are here
You're bringing the mint jelly, right?
The room is great, but could you send up some Woolite.
Hello, Ms. Peep? Yeah, they’re home. The doorman buzzed  ‘em in.”
It's not working.  I still can't fall asleep.
I don't know. Every time I start to count them I fall asleep.
I gotta get the flock out of this city.
Do you have any Border Collies by any chance?
They'll trade me back unharmed for a half-ton of clover and the surrender of the fleece shears.
I wanted to watch ewetube
The city is nice, but we're getting fleeced on rent.
Hi, I’m in 1402 and was wondering if I could get an order of oats or ivy up here?
I don't know.  I fell asleep counting.
I was counting, not inviting.
Watching Silence of the Lambs." Again
Retirement is complicated.
Sleep Therapist? Yeah you've got the right number.
Mary's out right now, I'm the sitter.
No, you misunderstood.  My problem is not with sheepless  nights...
The boss said I can work from home today.
I matched with a Bo Peep on Tinder and when I woke up this morning, she was gone and these guys were here.
Not much, just watching the evening ewes.
I think you are looking for my sister Bo.  I keep my sheep in my living room and know exactly where to find them.
Honey, I fear my mid-life crisis may have hit a new low.
Yeah, hi,  I would like to order the Sooper Pooper Scooper.
Hello, Ms. Peep? I found them. They just came in for dinner and a show.
They’re back!  The restraining order didn’t work.
One followed me to school and it just snowballed.
Nothing. Just wool-gathering.
I promise I'll have a final count for you first thing tomorrow.
I said I herd ewes.
Sheperding is much easier with all the degreulation.
Hello. Insomnia Solutions here.
I am not in Witness Protection,Ma,I am on the lamb!
Yes, Room Service, could you send up your Vegan menu?
Babysitting for Mary, you?
Why yes, Ms. Peep, I believe I’ve found them.
Hi, Bo Peep. You won't believe this.
I told your customer service, 'a dozen white SHEETS'!
Hello, .... Mary, .... we have a problem.
They were in the living room the whole time.
Well, I'll go if everyone else is going.
Yeah, I finally made the rural to urban shift, but it's hard to let go entirely....
They followed me to work today, work today,WORK  today! They followed me to work today and I just got fired.
Not much.  Just bringin’ the farm closer to the table.
Yes, Sealy? I’ve woken up but they’re still here.
Nothing much, just watching “Dances with Wolves”.
I reckon folks in "the city that never sleeps" could use my services.
Yes, Doctor, I'm sleeping much better now.
I,m in deep sheep now!
‘It didn’t work .....just send up the Ambien”
Well, I was successful with urban farming and I thought this would be a lateral move.
I came in to watch Fox News and they decided to follow.
Hello Mr. Peep, this is Shep, could I speak with your daughter Bo?
They insist on watching Hannity
No, I’ve never married... why do you ask?
Feeling a little under the weather, going to work from home today.
Yes, this is Sleep Apnea Solutions.  What time do you want us to arrive at your home?
Not much...just keeping the wolf away from the door
It's great to finally be able to work from home!
Unmarked bills Bo Peep, and don’t think about calling the cops
I was skeptical at first, but working from home has its advantages.
We’re here for the primary, Mr. Trump, but frankly I think your base could use more diversity.
As usual, the black sheep didn't show up.
Yes sir...
Yes sir...
Three bags, full.
Hopefully going method for the Nativity play will really pay off.
Sorry honey I had to bring my work home tonight.
Yes, I used only cold water.  They're hanging around now, drying out.
Hi Mom. You were right. I just got home and sure enough they came back all on their own.
No, my roommate doesn't mind.  They help him fall asleep at night.
I need a better work-life balance.
Of course they're well-behaved. They're sheep!
I’m working remotely today.
I have to get them out of here by hook or by crook.
Tell me again how this is supposed to help me sleep.
I had a sheep over last night.
Yes. Little Bo-Peep, they are here. ALL OF THEM!
It's not as pastoral as the brochure appeared.
I might be asleep.
I say we get the flock out of here and see the city.
I've tried that--I'm still having trouble sleeping.
The rams are now in Los Angeles?
How do you think I could bid so low on that park lawn maintenance contract.
Yeah, I'm working from home today. What are you up to?
Would you tell Little Bo Peep - I've found her sheep?!
Can I call you back? Things are a little wild and woolly right now
Thirteen fit in the freight elevator with me.  The door man is watching the rest
Hello?  Can I please speak to Mary?
Oh, wool gathering. How about you?
Sleep Disorder Treatment Center, Bo Speaking.
One fruit smoothie, and two hundred shots of wheatgrass please.
Hey guys. A sigh of relief all around. Wool is up.
I don’t know, I stopped counting
Bo? Yes. Yes. 57th and  Park. Apt. 28-C. I have no idea. OK. Bye.
Hello, is this 'Sheepless in Seattle'?  Well, meet me at the Empire State Building and your prayers will be answered.
Its sort of like dog sitting.
Have you herd?
Yes, I'm trying to reach Little Bo Peep
My high school guidance counselor predicted this.
Ohhh. I thought the song lyrics were “I want to wake up in a city with a dozen sheep!”
Are the wolves still around Wall St?
We're making our Christmas sweaters from scratch this year.
What do you mean you don't allow dogs?
Do you deliver grass? No, not that kind.
I’m counting on getting a good rest tonight
Please send a sheepdog to suite 7c
No Doc, I woke up and they were still here!
It doesn't work: I haven't slept in days.
I can’t tonight, I brought work home!
I'm fine. What about Ewe?
I'd like a hundred pounds of grass cuttings and a shepherds pie.
I wish I could relax, but I keep taking my work home with me.
Ram Service?
I counted 20. Didn’t help at all.
Of course, I feel sheepish. We all do.
I still can’t sleep, but at least I found a new job.
I hope she likes it, I got it for her at makeyourownsweater.com
What? Oh, that’s just the T.V.
Finding a reliable sheep-walking  service is tough, but otherwise I'm loving the city life.
No, no - I said "I'm FLOCKED!"
Bo-Peep and I would love to move, but our apartment is rent controlled.
City dog pound? Do you have any border collies available?
At last! I've found the secret to shear happiness.
Tonight? Probably Shepherd's pie.
Oh, I'm just keeping watch over my flock by day . . how's everything with you?
For heaven's sake, not a word of this to Bo-Peep.
They thought I was Trump and followed me home
I seriously need to get a wolf.
How much is the pet fee again?
Your "farm to table" wool has arrived!
Hello, Mary ?
Uh, Siri, can you find me a "Little Bo Peep" who lost her sheep?
I saw it on Flocks News
Counting isn't working, could you send up some Xanax​?
Yep, still having trouble sleeping.
I told Alexa I wanted a twelve-rack of lamb, not a twelve-pack of lambs!
The hardest part was the elevator.
I struck gold finding a pet friendly apartment
I hate taking my work home with me
Peep residence.  No, she’s out looking for something.
Hello, Bo? I bet you know why I'm calling.
It didn't work.  I'm still up.
Yea, I’ve tried counting them. Doesn’t help at all.
But you told me counting sheep would help me fall asleep—what do you mean “I don’t actually need to buy them”?
No, I'm staying put today but I brought some work home.
Put BoPeep on the phone.
IT'S TOM AGAIN, MISS PEEP - RANSOM WILL BE $50,000.
This is the last time I'm going to be able to pass you guys off as service animals, so you better enjoy yourselves.
Hi Bo?  No worries, they’re with me.
I found them. They bought a condo in Denver. Said they came for the grass.
Yeah, we're all here. Just waiting for my dog to dial in.
Room service? Would you please send up a cheeseburger and a dozen salads.
And you say the Border Collie will be how much longer?
I'm going to have to call you back. I'm getting awfully sleepy.
Can you add Animal Planet to my cable account?
It's just so easy to get distracted when you work from home.
Hello, this is the Sleep Wellness Institute. How can we help you?
Counted ‘em twice and I’m still awake, so what do I try now?
Hello, Bo Peep? I’ve found them.
Yeh, I have them.
We agreed to joint custody, but since then I haven’t heard even a peep.
Yes, they are registered to vote!
Yes, I tried counting them, but I'm still wide awake.
Ok I only need 10 of you for a nap...the rest of you go back to the bedroom
Yes, hello, is this the Church of the Good Shepherd? Oh thank God, I could really use your help!
No, the sleeping situation is great actually.
You say you can't sleep? I'll be right there!
Yeah, , no - we are staying inside until UGG season is over.
So Bo. You ready to meet my demands?
I  took the flock to higher ground, just like you said.
Give me your absolute best price on mint jelly.
I know, mom. They have no idea how good they have it.
Some don't want to watch Fox News.
Yes Bo, they’re wagging their tails, behind them.
Yes, I've unplugged the cable box an plugged it back in--but they didn't go away.
My wife has told me to get the Flock outa here !
Yeah, I'm here, protecting the flock from the Wolves of Wall Street.
Bo Peep isn't here.  I'm subletting.
Hello Bo Peep? You'll never guess where I found your sheep.
This is Flushing Meadows Sleep Center, how can I help you?
There's no demand anymore. People just rely on HGTV and Xanax.
I describe the style as more baa-haus
Room service? What do you have to graze on?
I'm counting on getting to sleep tonight!
They won’t go daownstairs after watching “The Wolf of Wall Street.”
Yes officer, she's about 2' tall and answers to 'Hey, ewe.'
Not much.  Just watching the nightly ewes.
Yeah, I got wool.
I bailed when she said she was a cat person.
Should we tell her counting sheep is a figure of speech?
Turns out she’s more of a frisbee dog.
Mutton residence, Jeff speaking.
To be truthful, I'm feeling a little sheepish right now!
How do I get the flock outta here?
Bo, they came home.
Yo,Bo?
Movie night was a bust. It had nothing to do with either silence or lambs.
Yeah.....I'm watching EweTube....
Mary's out, this is Joe.
Can we watch the Lions game at your house?
Tell Bo Peep that I'm willing to make a deal.
Beau Peep here. I found 'em.
Yea mate, this is the greatest Airbnb ever!
You wanted me to work from home more often, so now what is it?
They were under the sofa cushions this whole time!
We came in to watch 
Ewe tube
Bo-Peep and I have joint custody.
Yessir, yessir - 3B’s full!
Of course I'm alone. There will never be another ewe.
Yo, Little-Bo! I found 'em.
My doctor thinks that I’m sheep deprived.
Room service? Yes, that's one bushel of hay and a warm cinnamon bun.
They heard about the Wolf of Wall Street and freaked.
Miss Peep? Yes ma'am, I found them.
Hello, is this Bo Peep? I think I found them.
I'll bring them over later today. Right now I need them to help me take a nap.
Yes, this is Bro Peep.
Because I like them, Mother, they are my friends.
Uh, hey Bo.
Hello, Center for Herding Disorder?
Room service? Yes I know that marijuana is not legal here.  But I seriously need a supply of grass.
I’m at the air baa and baa across from sheep’s meadow.
Yeah, she's fast asleep. Where to next?
The problem is that I ordered fifety thread count white sheets.
I promise I'll stop bringing my work home.  Please come back.
I am trying to assimilate to NY but I miss New Zealand.
Urban Farming has its drawbacks.
Yes, we’re all sleeping better. Thanks!
To sheep. perchance to dream?
Well, at least my base loves me...
No, Bo Peep, this is not just a come-on to get you up to my place.
Is this Bo Peep from match.com?
Bo Peep, I've found them.
I'd like to order 1 pizza and 12 Caesar salads, without dressing.
Central Park’ great, but the Sheep’s Meadow is too dangerous at night.
And to confirm, you still have a pet-friendly co-op policy.
Yes, this is Mary.
Yes, my insomnia is gone, my problem now is what to do with so many sheep
You don't think I've tried counting them?
I know, I know, you want to get the flock out of here.
I’d like to make an appointment for a haircut
So, your Tinder page says you like the feel of raw wool...
Look Mom, I tried the pills.  This is the only way I  can get to sleep.
I heard you.  I herd ewe.
I'd like everything from your fresh greens menu plus one shepherd's pie
Room service?  I need more than a dozen sheep.  I still can’t get to sleep.
Miss Bo Peep, I believe I’ve found your sheep.
Update for Alumni Newsletter - Urban Artisan Shepherd -
 Single but looking
Dr. Wiley? Okay I’ve finished five episodes of ‘Perry Mason.’ Nope, still awake. 
Yeah, tried that, too.
These ones are defective. I'm still wide awake.
I've got to get the flock out of here.
Yes, I’d like to order the Duck a L’Orange and a dozen side salads..
I work from home.
Oh, yeah.  I have a lot of followers.
He fell asleep at thirteen.  Can the rest of us go now?
The last thing I remember is I was counting sheep.
I told you, it's the only way I can sleep"
Yeah, I found 'em.
'fleece navidad to you too, mom.'
How long did I sleep?
Hello? Yes, this is Mr. Peep.
Yeah, I'm over at Bo Peeps now.  You're not going to believe this!
At least the insomnia's not a problem anymore.
My stock broker told me to get into commodities.
No, it’s a walk-up, unfortunately...
It worked, but you didn’t say they’d be here in the morning
Alexa, can you get me Wolf on CNN?
Honey, the hotel is just great --and they absolutely guarantee a good night's sleep!
I think the Ambien is starting to kick in.
Hey honey? The little one followed Mary to school again.
Yep, we're all here watching Fox News.
Hello, I'm responding to the ad for an Old English Sheepdog . . .
Hello.  This is Mr. Peep.  I want to report a missing person.
Found them - They were binge-watching Lassie.
Apparently, they'll follow anyone with a crook.
So you’re saying that I definitely will not be getting back my security deposit?
Of course I counted them.
Sorry, I can't reveal my location. I'm on the lam.
Hello Uber, are you pet friendly?
I STILL can't fall asleep. Send some drugs.
I'm not sure I've got the hang of this urban farming thing.
The lease says nothing about sheep.
I’ll try and give you a call later, but I’m having a hard time staying awake,
I want you to get the flock outta here!
Exactly how did Little Bo Peep lose her sheep again?
I only want them at night.
Yeah, I herd!
The new job is great: I can work from home without a computer
Lost her sheep, you say?
At this point, I’m never sure what’s a good investment.
You gotta ask yourself, just how much a good night’s sleep is worth right now?
I need to stop taking my work home with me.
I’d like to order a pepperoni pizza and 12 salads.
One medium pepperoni and three extra-large with double alfalfa.
Ohhhh...you meant to metaphorically count.
Bo Peep, I've found your sheep.
When that ram shows up at the front desk please send him to room 427.
No idea how many..  I can't count them or I might go to sleep!
Hey Bo!  We lost you at the exit ramp. We're already at your place.
Somehow I didn't think the whole 'leave them alone and they'll come home' thing was going to work for a 10-floor walk-up.
Such are the hazards of bringing your work home with you.
Of course I counted them! But I'm still awake.
Baa-ing? No, it must be on your end
Yeah Doc, I still have insomnia.
Well I decided to do this online dating thing and I meet this really nice gal, Lil Bo Peep, and things started getting really serious, really fast and the next thing I know...
You will like it here, Abigail. The maid says they wash the sheeps every morning.
I'm watching this crazy story about a cat lady....
Actually, I've lost my way also.
Air B & B? I said I wanted a place where I could get some sleep.
Please send an extra shaving kit up to room  811 - thank you.
I don't think your sleeping pills work -- or they work too well. I can't tell anymore.
No, Mary's not here but the lambs are.
I'm trying to see how many they  are, but I keep falling asleep.
It was an amicable separation. Bo Peep_went her way. I went mine
We are hiding from the Wolf Of Wall Street
What do I do after I've counted them?
You won't believe what we went through on the subway ride home.
I offer the only locally farmed sheep in New York City.
Oh nothing, just binge watching some sheep
Please tell Bo-Peep that I found her lost sheep, and she has 24 hours to come get them before I start writing a little ditty of my own!
We all made it to the City except for Mary and the  lamb.
Minding my sheep and you?
It’s safe for you to come now. I had the whole apartment pasturized.
Doc, I still can't get to sleep.
Send me up some sleeping pills, these sheep aren’t working.
Room service? You forgot the black one...
She's given me 24 hours to get the flock out of here.
We’ll be up here through the winter. Kiss the dog for me.
Doc?...remember that suggestion for my insomnea?
Hello, Bopeep?  I saw your flyer in the laundromat.
No, no — I told you I'm a 'herder' , not a 'hoarder'.
They don’t allow dogs or cats; didn’t say anything about sheep.
I know you told me not to bring my work home, but I couldn't sleep.
Yeah, tell him I found his base.
No, it didn’t work out. She was tired of me always taking my work home.
Tell dad that I've decided to take my talents to New York
Well, I'm quite happy here.  But they're a little uncertain about living in Sheepshead Bay.
Cats might be easier.
I’ve changed my mind. I get the penthouse in the city and you get the 500 acres in Ireland.
I just feel like I've got to get the flock out of here.
Yes, Hello? Customer service? This new Ambien prescription is not what I expected.
Maybe my knitting has gotten a little bit out of hand, but on the plus side I've never slept so well
I don't think they really thought it through when they offered working from home two days a week.
Why, what have you herd?
It's not working. I'm wide awake!
No doc, it didn't cure my insomnia.
Everybody in the living Nativity got the flu, so what do I do with all these sheep?
I'm disrupting "farm to table."
One medium pepperoni pizza and two hectares of your premium Irish pasture grass.
Yeah, tell Bo-Peep, "look no further..."
It's a nice room, and I've never slept better.
Great restaurants, but I've been thinking about moving back to the country.
No, dude, YOU shut the flock up!
It’d be a lot easier if the condo association would let me have a dog.
I booked us the sheepest room
I told you the white carpeting was a b-a-a-a d choice.
Room service?  I'll have one Shepherd's Pie.
Tell Bo Peep I want 500 dollars if she every wants to see them again ...
I will be needing a few extra staff
It's kinda like that movie The Birds, only with sheep.
No, the insomnia hasn't gone... Yes, I have tried counting them.
I'm trying to relax but work just follows me everywhere!
I got this new sheep-sitting app to make a couple extra bucks and you’d be surprised how many people in the city own sheep.
Listen, their Black Friday sale was too good to pass up.
"I can't tell which one is the wolf in sheep's clothing"
Well mom, it turns out you CAN fit a whole flock into a studio appartment.
Oh, nothing, just doing some wool-gathering.
I’ve no idea now many. I fall asleep counting.
I can talk to you until the cows come home.
I can’t wait to get the flock out of here.
No mom it isn’t ‘just a phase’.
Give me the insomniac’s room number.
Of course I've tried counting them! ...Okay, I'll hold.
Working from home today, boss.
Can it wait? I'm working from home today.
I hate to tell you Darlene, but I think you misunderstood when I said 'I love ewes so much.'
Nah,we're all going to stay home to watch Martha Stewart make shepherd's pie.
But nobody had a problem with my working from home when I was in Accounting.
Come on Bo Peep, pick up!
Okay, I counted the sheep.  Now what?
Bo-Peep?  I think I have what you're looking for.
Sorry, I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to ewe.
What's the return policy on your large box of sleep aid?
I’d like the M-U-T-T-O-N chops?
Yes, doctor, it's urgent. I can't stop the bleating.
Seriously? No pets allowed?
Yes, hello. I'd like to submit a complaint, my neighbor's dog won't stop barking and the lease says no pets.
Twelve I think, but I still can't sleep
No, I said thirteen salads. Thirteen.
Inventory is up, but I'm down to my last staff.
I keep trying to get a count of them but I always fall asleep before I finish
Would you mind picking up 500 pounds of clover on your way home?
Peep here. Found  ‘em
I didn't say I was taking a nap. I said I was home counting sheep.
Yeah, I'm bummed out, but you should see my severance package.
I can't talk right now. We're watching "Breaking Baaad."
Counting them makes me sleepy, but the smell keeps me wide awake.
Yes, I've tried.  There are twelve of them.
Urban farming has made me a lot closer with the flock
Ive been counting them all day and I still can't get to sleep.
I'm staying at an Airbahnbah
Oh, you said sleep over.
Is Mary there ?
The real challenge was getting them on the elevator.
As Airbnb’s go, it’s alright. But I was hoping for something a bit more rural.
Hello, Amazon? I think there's been a mix-up. Yes, my name is A. Shepherd. Why do you ask?
Yes, I do respect you . . . I understand . . . So will you please, please come home Lassie!
Hello Amazon, we have a problem.
I've got the Baa. You bring the Humbug.
We'd watch Silence of the Lambs, but they never stay quiet.
I’m trying to vacation, but it seems like my work follows me everywhere.
Hi Bo. It’s Dad. Just wondering when you’re coming back from your trip
I hate bringing work home with me on the weekend.
It's amazing, Jack. Ever since I took this job my number of followers has skyrocketed.
He’s counted us three times already. How is he still awake?
Uh-oh! Wolf documentary.
No, it hasn’t helped the insomnia.
Get the flock outta here.
That's correct, my delivery order is a pastrami on rye and 6 bales of hay.
I feel a nap coming on.
MARY --where are you ?
Turns out it's true what daytime TV turns people into.
It's a bit messy, but I sure fall asleep a lot faster now.
Hello, Bo? Yeah, I found 'em.
Can Larry do it? I'm working from home today.
It’s farm to suite to table
....but honey, other husbands bring there work home sometimes.
I have no idea how many . . . I fall asleep as soon as I get past seven.
They wanted to see who won the herding group at Westminster.
Hey Bo-Peep.  You want to see your sheep again?
What Smell?
Get Bo_Peep on the line.  I found them.
Counting sheep didn't work, so I'm watching C-SPAN.
Oh, just gathering wool. . .
No, I beg to differ, but I specifically ordered the lamb chops"...
We should get together, I'm working from home, too.
Hi , I'd like to order a shepherd's pie to go.
Can you send up more pillows?
Can we agree that we’ve taken this whole “work from home” thing a bit too far?
I don't have an I problem. I have a ewe problem.
Me? Oh, nuthin', just chillin' and watching the evening ewes.
It's a miracle! Our flock is safe from the wolves of Wall Street.
Hi, is Mary there?
I tell you this place has a GREAT pet policy !
I should have gotten the two bedroom.
They told me, "Leave them alone, and they'll come home."
Hey! You're my agent! Somewhere there's gotta be a better job than rounding up a crowd for Trump rallies.
I decided to move to greener pastures.
No I wish I could,but my family's in town.
I know the sheep prefer the pasture but I just want to be like all the other millennials working from home.
I still can’t stop bringing my work home with me.
Well exactly what time does the damn field open?
Well I like to think of it more as farm-to-table.
No, we'll come back when YOU apologize.
Hello Sheep Rescue? Okay, I'll hold.
They're easier to count than votes.
Sorry, I was just nodding off when you called.
No, we're having a night in for a change.
I think one of them ate the remote.
Yeah, I invited over a few friends from work.
It looks like Mary took off with the little one.
All right, have it your way—you heard a sheep bleat!"
We’ll take twelve garden salads and a fish sandwich.
Just putting the "pen" in penthouse.
I found a way to get to sleep.
Lassie, can you pick up the lambs after school?
I don't know why I am having such a hard time staying awake.
I'd like to cancel pay-per-ewe.
Sure,moving to the city was a big transition,but bringing the flock has really helped.
Don't worry, the wolves don't have a clue where we are.
Last thing I remember is counting them.
Peep's Sleep Service ...
Herding is so much easier with only 500 square feet
Yes, it’s a little tight but the flock and I had to face facts - we’re city folk.
Apparently they don't allow dogs in this place.
Yeah, that's right, Bo Peep.  Tell her they don't want to come home
Tell me about this Ambien thing again.
Found them.  They followed a hedge fund manager.
We lost her somewhere in Times Square.
Just wool-gathering... and you?
Hello?  Bo Peep?
The melatonin hasn’t been working.
Work from home,” they said
Bo, they're home but they're not wagging their tails.
The at home course is definitely educational but I can't wait to get out and do the field work.
Trust me, the Rams will win this.
Then I'd give the Ambien a try.
Sure I can talk, I'm just tending to some work I took home.
The pay is fine, but working from home is turning out to be a lot less convenient than expected.
That's right 10 large pizzas, half grass, half clover.
It’s for ewe.
People don't understand the sacrifices us Brooklynites make for true farm to table.
Doing? Just sitting here thinking of ewe.
Room Service, I'd like to order from the grazing menu.
But its halftime and the Rams are on.
What channel is the Rams game on?
I think I’ll just get some sleeping pills.
Abiding in the penthouse, keeping watch. You?
I'm afraid all I have left are a dozen white.
No, I'm the service animal.
When the co- op board asked if I had any pets, I said I had to count sheep to help me fall asleep. I guess they took it figuratively. Now I have to go for the “emotional support animal” waiver.
I could have sworn it said Air Baa and Baa.
Hello.  Is this Mary?
This is where we'll winter.
Bob says I need to stop bringing work home.
Yes Ms Peep, they are here, all 12 of them.
Maintenance?  Please, the elevator needs some attention.
I’m sorry. Mary is unable to come to the phone.
Room service? I’ll have the ribeye with baked potato, asparagus and 400 pounds of oats.
Hello, customer service? I need help changing my ringtone.
Yeah ,we're in but it wasnt easy sneaking everyone past reception..
Landlord has had it. Told me I had to “get the flock out” of her apartment.
Working from home has become the new trend
Right, 3 pizzas with fescue, 3 with Kentucky Bluegrass, and could you throw in a gallon of Woolite?
I still feel a bit sheepish working from home.
Sure, we miss the backyard, but at least here they'll get some cultural exposure.
They're flocking to New York.
No, seriously dude, you wouldn't believe how hard
it is to pull the wool over their eyes.
No! I said I wanted a room for my ewes.
I’m looking for a “Miss Bopeep”?
Hi, Miss Peep. I know where you can find them.
Yes, I have tried counting sheep...
Yes, I also do dog-sitting and cat-sitting.
Trying to reach Little Boy Blue; I've got a small emergency here.
I think my therapist nailed it: I've got to stop taking my work home.
If this doesn't bring Bo back to me, nothing will.
Hey Mom, found 'em. We're at your place.
I'm not sure that working from home was such a good idea!
Hey, Sheepless in Seattle — I think I can help you out.
I tried, Ma! I still can't sleep!
After downsizing from the farm, the flock is starting to question my leadership...
On rainy days, they INSIST on coming inside and watching "Babe" on DVD.
Hasn't changed. They still follow me everywhere against the rules.
Good news. Solved my sleeping problems.
Apparently roaming is not covered.
Ambien made me do weird things.
I know the meal delivery kit said fresh ingredients, but this is too fresh.
I got a role in a play about GOP voter registration, but it’s a bit too literal...
I've run into a spot of bother with the co-op board.
Well, yes, herding sheep is a lot easier in the City.
The landlord said we better get the flock outta here.
I don't know how long I'm gonna last at this job, Ma...I keep falling asleep.
Ram service, please!
My occupation?  I'm a work-from-home shepherd.
Where in the flock am I?
You wouldn't believe how much my sleep has improved.
For take out please. One large Margherita pizza and 12 green salads, hold the onions.
Hey, Bo! Guess what I found!
When do you think Little Bo Peep can get over here?
Yes, this is Little Boy Blue. - No, they're not in the meadow.
Absolutely the view is great, but I thought I was dog sitting.
Hello, Room Service? This isn't what it sounds like, but I need someone to go out and get me some grass - quite a bit of grass.
Well, how would the tentant's feel about free sweaters?
I'm just having a few coworkers over.
I'll have the pepperoni pizza, a diet Coke and a case of Woolite.
I found an Air bah-n-bah.
I’m their leader now, and I kind of like it.
A Trump rally all white sheep
You were right about Brooklyn.
Here? Because, in Seattle it's sheepless.
No, she’s not lost.....she’s in the black sheep matter march.
Yes, you heard me right. That’s one shepherd’s pie, a bottle of Bud, and a dozen bushels of fresh mown grass.
Please tell me the price of wool  today.
No.  I will not accept a collect call from Miss Bo Peep!
Doctor, counting sheep doesn't seem to be working.
Must be time for Sean Hannity.
I really shouldn't have ordered the sheep before the farm
But Dad...the meadow was really hot!
Hi Amazon. I received my flock, but do you have the tracking number for my herding dog?
Now I know why Mary didn't have two little lambs.
What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
Front desk...I'm missing one.
That's fake news, I never lost any sheep!
The view is great but the Condo board is trying to fleece us.
Business has been tough since we moved to the city that never sleeps.
Home game,rooting for the Rams against theLions.
Need a few more...still can't sleep.
They call it urban herding
We thought we'd stay in and Netflock.
No, the condo association won't reconsider. So much for the urban farming concept.
Remember telling me wool futures were hot? You'll never guess what I did.
I'm not sure how long I've been asleep.
No, I said take them to the highest grazing spot on the Matterhorn, not Manhattan.
And to add insult to injury, I still cant sleep.
Working from home today...need to focus on my staffing strategy.
Tell the doctor I've changed my mind. I need that prescription for sleeping pills as soon as possible.
Well, for the past few months I’ve been working remotely but I’d be very interested in exploring other opportunities.
Good news, Ms. Peep!
I'm missing one. What did Mary have for dinner?
Last thing I remember was the dog leaving
Nothing. Ewe?
You're talking a lot but all I'm hearing is baa baa baa.
Gotta go. We’re due at yoga.
I’m sorry for taking this call from my cell. I’m shepherding from home today.
If my landlord allowed me to have a dog I'd at least be able to keep them organized.
Yeah, but it's not cheap once you sign up for pay per ewe.
You mean I don't have to buy sheep to count them?
I've counted them!  I've counted them, and I still can't sleep!
Oh, you know, same old baa, baa, baa...
You need them back for a vote?
I saw your ad for a wolf.
I know we've talked about bringing work home.
Is this room service? I'd like to order shepherd's pie.
You were right, I should have tried sleeping medication
Apparently, there was no room in the manger.
Nah, man—this isn’t even the strangest Airbnb I’ve been to.
If I can pull this off it will change herding as we know it forever.
I'd like to but I'm very sleepy right now
Room Service?  I need a dozen shepherd's pies.
Of course I didn’t bring them in the house.
Remind me, how this is supposed to help me sleep?
The experts call it semi-sedentary pastoralism.
Once I realized I could work at home, it was 'Big city, here I come!'
Right. Free-range, not pasture-raised.
Just so you know, this on-line video course makes it look more like an outdoor profession.
What channel is Fox News?
So, I get to be my own boss and the sheep like the view.
Little Bo Peep got the house in the divorce.
It's a new app - they call it Air Baa & Baa
Old MacDonald moved uptown, E-I-E-I-O.
I ordered a black sheep.
I would like to order four alfalfa pizzas.
Yes, all of our meats are locally sourced.
The ad said the apartment was perfect for a crook on the lam but I think I got fleeced.
So you're telling me to get the flock out of here?
I think I can get more space in Brooklyn.
Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Lambs Without Borders...
Be right there. I have a few things to tend to.
It’s Sunday.  I’m tending my flock!
Mind if I bring some work along?
Nope.  Bo Beep isn't here.  I'm just house sitting.
Oh, not much, just hangin' with the base watching the President's speech.
The room is fine, but do you have something with a Central Park view, perhaps a meadow of some sort?
White, yes. Can you be more descriptive, Ms. Bo Peep?
No, we're off today.  Apparently everyone slept well last night.
My business plan is still a little fuzzy.
Moving back in with my parents was easier than I expected
Yo little Bo.  Found the flock.  Meet me at my crib in 10.
Okay, I’ve got it.  Anything
 but “Silence of the Lambs”.
So you're sleepless in Seattle?
As you hear it. I had not slept well for months, I started counting sheep ... and now I can’t live without them.
Me? Nothing much, just watching some ewe tube.
Hello Uber.....  I need a ride to the meadowlands.....
Could I get some alfalfa sprouts with that?
Ok Doc, the counting hasn't worked. I'll try a sleeping pill
Tell Bo Peep I cracked the case.
No I'm not kidding ewe and I'm not trying to pull the wool over your eyes...I'm in New York on the lamb
Business is booming, apparently it’s really hard to sleep nowadays.
Hi Bo!  Nope; haven't seen them.
911?  There’s a missing 12-year-old female by the name of Bo Beep.
So I asked myself, what's a guy to do to make a buck now that the dog walking market has gotten so saturated?
Mary, I thought you said "A" little lamb.
What are the ingredients for shepherd's pie again?
So then he said, 'If you want a sweater, knit it yourself."
According to last nights dream, I'm one short.
Can I call you back? I'm binge watching Real Shepherds of New York.
Apartment sitting.  You?
No, we won't be needing utensils."
Hey, Bo. It's me. I found-em.
I’m pretty sure this isn’t what Nietzsche meant by ‘herd mentality.’
I know, I know. But you wouldn't believe the rent!
Deny it and tell the reporter I'm allergic to wool.
Well the good news is that we solved the fecal / nitrate  run off issue with the lake.
Pastureland is getting really expensive so now I just use airbnb.
I've been counting them but I still feel wide awake.
Looks like I'll need to order the optional sheepdog.
I don’t know. I thought I was walking into a Peep Show.
What is about wanting a contemporary farmhouse aesthetic do you not understand?
I'm telling you, it's like herding cats.
I'm fine dear. Dr. Smith prescribed me these ancient organic sleeping meds.
"Ordering one collie and a side of grass."
Are you sure it's OK if I work from home today?
No, I'm not having a party, it's just my emotional support sheep.
Miss Peep,  I've found your sheep.
Not bad as a trust building exercise, although we lost one in the            meatpacking district.
There was a spelling error!  I wanted sleep!
Has Little Bo Peep checked in yet?
Just chillin' with my sheeps.  What's up with you?
Can you please send up a dozen salads - hold the dressing...
I just ordered the shepherd's cane, the description didn't mention sheep.
I need to speak with Mary... ASAP!
Well, you can tell him for me, there isn't enough wool in the world to cover everybody's eyes in this country.
The Airbnb listing said 'pets welcome', so I really don't see the problem.
Room service?  Yes, a hamburger, fries, Coke,  and 13  grass and clover salads, hold the dressing.
Yes, Operator: first name "Little," last name "Peep."
I probably should have splurged on full service delivery and assembly for the sweater.
Didn't expect you to still be awake! I'm counting sheep too.
Is this Miss Bo Peep?  Yes, I found them for you.
This whole not getting to sleep thing has gotten way out of hand.
Hello room service?  I'd like to order eight bales of hay.
I tend to bring my work home with me.
I'm tele-herding today.
Would you like to join our sheepover?
Hello Mary, are you picking up your lambs today?
I'd like to place a pick-up order for 13 house salads--hold the Romaine.
My contract allows me to work remotely!
Possession is nine tenths of the law, Bo-Peep.
Yes ma'am, our guaranteed insomnia cure is both traditional and innovative.
I put “shepherd” on my match.com profile and now they’re really flocking to me.
Yeah mom, we just checked in to our Air Baa & Baa.
It’s hard to relax when the Wolf of Wall Street is out there.
We'll take the Rams by 3
I can offer you the latest advancements in sleep therapy.
Hello, front desk, I won't be needing that Sleep Number bed after all.
Yes, mom, they're still organic, but free range has been harder.
I was told this breed thrives at higher altitudes.
Yes, this is Little Boy Blue...
I'm on the lamb.
I keep telling them to use their indoors  voices.
I brought you a gift from New Zealand
I might have to rethink this whole "working remotely" thing.
Yeah, I thought he said “get the flock out of here.”
Bo, I've found them.
Yeah, I have their grass brought in from GrubHub now.
No, of course I don’t have a dog.
Just send up five vegetarian platters.
I'm trying to tell ya Karen; this new sleep therapy is amazing.
Hey Little Bo,good news.
What do Ewes want?!
I lucked out: great apartment, great view, and I found the sheep!”
Yes, I know what my lease says but I can assure you we herders do NOT consider them pets.
It's been a little wild and wooly trying to keep them all happy until we're needed for the nativity scene.....
I'm training the newly elected members of Congress, but I don't think they're going for it.
I've counted all my sheep, but I still can't fall asleep.
We're just going to order up some grass and chill.
Don’t worry, the fox will never get past the doorman.
When you book early, there IS room at the inn!
Don't you dare tell me you've got to work this evening, Bo-Peep.
No problem, I work from home.
John Williams insomnia service. May I help you?
Now I'm completely flocked.
No, Skipper's not with me.  Mom's condo has a 'no dogs' policy.
I'd like to order a large pepperoni thin crust and 40 pound of clover."
He said no to the raise but on Fridays I get to work from home.
Me? I'm just kickin' back while I work from home today.
Once a year, on his birthday, John's wife let him do whatever he wanted.
Room service?  Yes, we'd like to order 70 - Okay, Maisie, Okay - 80 pounds of your 60/40 alfalfa/timothy second cut Lake Champlain silage blend, and if you're still using the Versace troughware, that will make this a very special day for the girls.
My apartment?  Sheepshead Bay.  Why?
Room service....Send up a bottle of wine and four bales of hay
They did say that my emotional support flock was a first...
I know I'm the rookie agent, and I really do trust the bureau's judgement, but could we have concocted a more subtle undercover identity?
I hate bringing work home with me
What do you mean, I always bring my work home?
Ms Little Bo Peep, we have your sheep, pay the ransom or you'll never find them.
Yeah, I just wanted to report that Little Bo Peep has found her sheep.
I doubled my followers.
Can you shear me now?...Good.
Wanna come over?  I'm just hanging out with some friends from work.
They let me telecommute one day a week.
Mary, I'm going to work from home today.
Ms. Bo-Peep?  I have some good news.
Yeah, I'm going to need more ambien, doc.
I sold the farm and got a great deal  on .000000047 acres.
Not tonight, I'm catching up on work
Yeah I see the news, don't worry. I tied up all the loose ends... everyone will think she just lost 'em.
I've been up all night counting sheep."
Yeah, I'm just going to work from home today.
At least we don’t live in a shoe.
Why is it always about ewe,ewe,ewe
Next vacation I’ll find a sitter.
...me?  shepherding mostly...and you?
I keep falling asleep.
So, you're telling me the Wolf of Wall Street is a person?
I don’t know how many...I keep falling asleep counting them
I can't believe Airbnb let me get away with this.
Hello customer service; you're sweater kit came on time but the pattern wasn't included in the shipment.
Actually it all started when she followed me to school one day.
Well the Rams won by three, thank god.
Watching the Animal Channel. How about you?
Tell her it’s Mr. Bo-Peep calling.
Joseph's Sheep Counting Service.
Bo Peep? I think I’ve found them.
Two words: emotional support.
Yeah, I’ve gotta go. All these sheep are waiting for me to tell them what to do next.
Room service? I’d like a 
sheoherd’s pie and a dozen green salads,  no dressing.
Counting or sacrificial?
Can you believe it?  They placed me under house arrest for crying wolf!
Seriously?? It's like herding cats.
Large vegetarian please. Hold the olives, extra clover.
Guess what dad, I've become an urban farmer!"
Same old, same old. And ewe?
I'm just staying home and taking in the Silence of the Lambs.
Really, Bopeep, we need to talk.
If a Miss Bo Peep calls the desk, tell her I've checked out.
Mary is out, may I take a message?
I quit
Bo, I'm afraid the "stay at home husband" thing isn't working out.
Hello, Lambazon? I actually ordered the wool sheets not whole sheeps.
I was thinking to myself, 'Am I going to keep doing this 'til the cows come home?', when suddenly I got this idea.
It’s not as idyllic as I thought.
I've found that they aren't particularly fond of CNN, but they eat Fox News right up!
They seem to like anything with Katherine Hepburn.
Mutton Jeff here.
Sylvia, rooftop gardens are just the first step.
Bopeep Sleep Aids, how can we help you?
Little Bo? Found em.
I'm telling you doctor, I'm NOT asleep but these are the same sheep from my dream
I think I'm ready for Ambien.
'It's called Silence of the Lambs. You'll like it.'
Little Bo Peep does give a bleep.
Work-Life balance, my ass.
I just feel like I bring my work home with me, you know?
Yes, the name is Beau Peep. That's B-E-A-U.
I counted twelve and I'm still awake
Yes, it's for delivery; I'd like a shepherd's pie . . . and, oh, at least 50 pounds of fodder.
Little Bo Peep? You're never gonna believe this.
Is this Little Bo Peep? 
I think I've found you're sheep.
When I said I wanted grass delivered, I didn't mean for either recreational or medicinal use. I meant actual grass.
Could I get one large pizza and 40 pounds of clover, please?
I still can't sleep.
What? They need their Fox News.
I’m binge herding.
They kicked out the dog"
They said any kind of jelly except mint.
I hate it when my boss makes me take my work home
It's about my cable bill. I think I've been fleeced.
You'll never guess where I found them, Bo. Shall I leave them alone?
Wait, you said count them?
True, the Airbnb host said no dogs or cats.
My lamb chops are the freshest and I deliver.
Bo Peep? Yes, send her up.
Needed a break from the pastoral scene.
This is the nicest place we've ever found on Air Baa&Baa.
Hi? UPS? Yeah, I thing you sent me the wrong package. I never ordered a cane.
Airbnb customer service, yes, I am calling to report that the last guest forgot some of his stuff in the apartment.
I'd like to refill my ambien as soon as possible please.
Yes, for a small fee you can count sheep using Skype.
I'm trying to watch tv but I keep drifting off
My Border Collie ran off with a Labradoodle and here I am in some hotel on the Upper East Side.
New pasture. Same old shit.
I assure you, I am outstanding in my field.
I finally negotiated a work from home day. I couldn’t do it without a great staff.
I'm not ba-a-a-d, how are you?
Hey Blue, it's Bo.  Get your horn, they followed me home again.
The divorce is final......Little Bo Peep lost her sheep.
Ms. Bo Peep? This is your Uber driver. You left a couple of things in the backseat.
I'm good.  Ewe?
I can lead them to TV, but I can’t make them watch.
I'm not so much letting my mind wander as I am woolgathering.
Promised the co-op board lots of sweaters.
I really don't know.  I left them alone for a little while, and suddenly they all showed up here.  Wagging their tails behind them.
NOW do I qualify for a profile on farmersonly.com?
The apartment's OK, but I keep falling asleep on the couch...
I can't sleep. Any suggestions?
Yes.  It's just like goat yoga but you can have them for the entire week.
I am having a little problem streaming "Silence of the Lambs"!
When they said the job was in Dakota...I didn't know they meant THE Dakota!
I can't sleep.
Miss Bo-Peep? You're not going to believe what I found...
I took your advice, but I still can't sleep.
One order eggs over easy and a dozen oatmeals, extra dry
It's been very hard lately to leave my work at the office.
Nothing much, just watching Fox News with the boys.
I get distracted working from home.
I've gotta go--I'm getting really drowsy.
Silence of the Lambs got me into it, but as it turns out, they never shut up.
Oh, I thought you said get some sleep.
You can laugh, but I tell you it wasn’t easy getting them all in the elevator!
Hello, Miss Bo Peep?
Correct me if I’m wrong, but the lease mentions cats and dogs only.
Two acres of grass and a nicoise salad, please.
I was lying down in the green pasture and took a left on the path of righteousness
They won’t even let themselves be counted -  I think the national news is making them feel rebellious.
It's really cool.  The Rams are beating the Lions.
I tried that. Still couldn’t fall asleep.
They aren’t just a flock of sheep but also certified emotional support animals.”
It’s not me it’s ewe.
No!  I need a border collie.  You sent a labradoodle.
Bo Peep?  Exactly where did you lose those sheep?
Hello, Mary? We may have taken this too far.
Yes. this is Morty's Sheep Sitting Service.
We could definitely use some more mint jelly.
I thought you said make a yew turn!
I would much rather count blessings.
Oh, Just sitting in front of the TV with the kids.
I've had it with city living - I need to get the flock out of here.
Last night I counted them jumping over a fence, now they want to be fed.
Oh, nothing. Just trying to fall asleep.
Room 640 calling - send up some grass for one, and some grass for twenty!
I counted them all and I still can’t sleep.   Now what?
I just can't seem to separate work and home life.
Tell Bo the sheep came home.
Room service? Can you send up a roast beef sandwich on rye, a small greek salad, fries, mineral water and a bale of hay.
At my staff meetings they usually go along with me.
Thanks, but I think I'll just stay in tonight and watch the ewes.
She left a note: "Going back to the country. You can keep the sheep."
signed, Bo-peep
I think I have the answer to your insomnia.
That’s exactly what I said, “What the flock?”
Listen, Bo, I've got your sheep, but I'm going to want 'Hamilton' tickets first."
I think they found me on Facebook.
Hello Bo Peep, I think I have found your sheep.
Because they’re easier to shepherd than cats.
Don’t want to brag, but I’ve lost count of my number of followers.
Sorry, Ms. Peep is out. I’m the sitter.
Your Ubaa driver is 3 minutes away.
I'd say we're adjusting to the city life well.
It's a distance learning leadership course. They send you everything you need.
I know urban farming is very trendy this year, but I may have chosen the wrong crop.
Can you tell me how to get the flock out of here?
I know, I know. I shouldn't bring my work home.
This should be my best sleep in a long time
No, Ms. Peep is sleeping. I'm helping her with a recount.
You would not believe how hard it is to find a sheep friendly apartment in this neighborhood
What do you mean there is a wolf in the lobby?
Hello, Mary...I think I have good news
What’s your emotional support animal policy?
Don't worry, Mom, I'm looking out for the wolves of Wall Street.
The mini-bar is all out of clover.
Yeah, I slept pretty well last night. I think I can count on them again tonight.
So, the good news is that my health plan covers a sleep study, but...
Yeah, all good, we found a great Air Baa and Baa.
Yes! We are supposed to go everywhere she goes
press 1 for the little boy who lives down the lane
Yes, they all want to go... if I go.
The wolf?  Tell him we're not in.
Ms. Peep?  Got some good news and some bad news.
Are you coming for the Rams game?
No man! I said THREE bags full!
When the game is over we'll be back to finish the grass in the park.
Not baaaaad.  And you?
Wait!  You think the sleep center meant imaginary sheep?
I can't, I've got other things to tend to.
Oh, nothing much. Just watching TV.
I'm a stay-at-home shepherd.
Well, the wait at the barbershop was an hour, I had to take them somewhere...
Hold on a sec, someone is bleating in.
Can I call you back? My three o'clock is here.
No.  I am ordering real grass, not weed.
Yeah, it's so hard to disconnect from work these days.
Lassie, come home!
Room service, this sleep aid doesn't work for me, they snore.
I know where to find them.
So you’re saying it’s a staff infection?
Sorry to wake you, doc, but I don't think this is helping my insomnia."
Hey Bo, I know where your sheep are.
It's the lobby, the MAGA bus is here to take us to the rally.
Not exactly what you thought I meant by greener pasture, huh?
Yeah, but if I make it here, I can make it ANYWHERE.
I can't leave them in Central Park at night
This wasn’t what I expected when I clicked to get more followers.
No, YOU get the flock out of here!
I can't come in ... I had a sleepless night.
Hello.  Sleep assistance hotline!
Tell little bo peep she can stop looking
Well, despite the name, they evicted us from the Sheep Meadow, and we all have to appear in court on the 24th.
yes ,this is the Brooklyn sheep company and we do guarantee only locally grown wool
Hello, is it really necessary for your network to keep broadcasting "Silence of the Lambs"
Couldn’t sleep either last night?
Yes,we deliver. What time do you try to go to sleep?
Remember you told me to get a hobby?
You invited me for a 'sleep over'? I thought you 'invited my sheep over'.
No mom, I'm not SEEING anybody right now.
Okay, now what?  I've counted them, and I'm still wide awake.
Today we're going to explore Central Park.
I'm just tending the flock, dear. Where else would I be?
I could have sworn the real estate agent said, "I have a great space for ewe."
Yes room service, I thought I ordered leg of lamb with mint jelly.
Could you tell the people upstairs to keep it down?
Hi, Little Bo?  I have a question
I'm taking them to see Hamilton.
I was trying to sleep and I lost count.
The ewes from up here are excellent.
Are you sure the Magic Lint Brush can pick up wool?
You want a linen jacket? Now you tell me.
I’m on ambien so I’ll no longer require your services
Found 'em.  They were home all along just watching the Animal Planet.
....make that one shepherds's pie and a shovel.
Tell Bo they're here with me.
Yup my organic, natural color unspun yarn just arrived
Knitting group at my apartment next week
Unmarked bills. And come alone or they won't be "wagging their tails behind them" by the time I've finished.
I’d like the burger with fries and a bottle
of Woolite.
Yes, Principal, we told Mary it's against the rules but she claims its her emotional support animal and the note really is from her doctor.
So when this developer offered me $10 million for the land I decided to just go with the flow man.
Hi, can I leave a message for Miss Peep?
Good news, we now have the numbers in the Senate.
It's small but the rent is sheep.
No more legal restrictions now that it's an Air-Baa-n-Baa.
The neighbors may hate my pets but they love the sweaters.
That's why I ordered Uber XL."
We're watching "The Wolf of Wall Street."
Sometimes, I like to follow them.
Three days a week, I work from home.
Hello, Bo? Balthazar here. I found them.
They say they'll come home if you leave them alone.
Yeah, this is Larry Bo Peep again. I found them.
I said 11 Meg of RAM not 11 leg of lamb!
Yeah, I’m at my sister’s in the city for Thanksgiving. She said all were welcome, but to be honest, she’s being kind of rude to the sheep...
They refuse to watch Fox News.
Hello, room service? Yeah, I want the eggs and bacon breakfast with a bale of alfalfa on the side.
Bleating? No one here is bleating. Maybe it's the White House press conference on TV.
Sir, I AM answering the question. I said, " I herd ewe"
Lamb chops for dinner sounds good."
Went off-grid, chose the simple life, but it just didn't work out. You?
Just sitting here wool gathering.
And to think I moved here to escape the herd mentality.
No, I never have trouble getting to sleep. Why do you ask?
Yeah, Little Boy Blue here...Sheeps in the penthouse, are the cows in the condo?
It's no use Doc, even the sheep can't sleep.
Yeah, good time to talk. Just counting sheep.
Not much...just channel grazing.
Nothing much. What's up with you?
Hey, Hans, I think I'm gonna work from home today.
Damn Google maps!
We’re watching ‘Babe.’  What are you doing?
Of course I'm running for president. I have my staff and my staff.
Thank you for calling Bo-Peep Sleep Care, how many sheep would you like to count for a great nights sleep?
A child is born where?...you're breaking up...
I should have known.  The Central Park Sheep Meadow Airbnb sounded too good to be true.
Yeah doc, I’m up to 12 but still can’t fall asleep.
Keep counting?
I don't know how many we got, I tried counting but I got too tired.
My doctor said count sheep and I'd sleep better.
The problem is getting them all into my bed at the same time.
What makes you think I sound sheepish?
I counted sheep yesterday night, and you know what they say about dreams coming true
I will call later. I am getting sleepy.
Is this Bo-Peep? I found your sheep.
I know, I know.... but I always have trouble sleeping in hotels.
You mean I was supposed to leave them on the farm?
... and there's a rooftop pasture!
This is Mr. Shepherd in 10G.
They're all too dull.  Please send up a black one.
It’s nice. I found it on Airbaanbaa.
I count them and still can't get to sleep.
Don’t bother.  They’re here.
Room service? two bales of alfalfa and send someone to help with the television
Corporate relocation works better for some professions than others.
Peep here. Yeah, I nabbed the whole gang.
I counted them all and I still can't sleep.
I realized the advantages of working from home.
Can you connect me to Little Bo Peep?
Yes, that's three dozen diapers with holes for tails. I'll explain later.
Well, the hotel said it welcomed pets!
People in the city are encouraging me to get back to work... they keep saying, 'Get the flock outta here.'
Honest Hon, I'm with the sheep in the meadow.
The old lady who lived in a shoe got $2.3 million and I'm not taking a penny less.
I thought that i would work from home today
I'm so much more productive when working from home
Sorry, no, it doesn't seem to work. I'm still awake!
Yes, I herd you.
they say they've gone astray
I think we need to rethink that nativity scene.
Right. 8B. I’d like six bales of the organic alfalfa and one bowl of the beef barley soup. One spoon. That’s it.
I’d like one general Tso’s Chicken and fourty wheat grass smoothies.
Can you send up ten gallons of Woolite?
Hey Bo, I found them
This isn’t what I thought you meant when you said your friends were sheepish.
No! No!  I’m NOT an Australian Shepherd.  I   NEED an Australian Shepherd!
No, you won’t have to do windows.  However,..
Hello, Amazon? No...I ordered a "flocked tree"
Sorry to bother you, but I'm just wondering...when was the last time you updated Google maps?
Well, I’m actually only half Amish.
I'm starting to think that they pulled the wool over my eyes with this apartment.
I miss the sprawling, green hillsides but my flock seems to have become quite gentrified.
It's been great. I get to work from home three days a week.
Well the boss finally let me work from home
Lost in the woods my ass.  It's 81st Street.
Sorry.  My phone was in sheep mode.
What do you mean I always choose work over you?
...small with pepperoni & two bales of alfalfa
Way better than being called the Cat Lady!
It's a cartoon. That's why you don't see any sheep poop.
Sorry, I can’t come in today, I’m feeling rather sheepish.
Bo-Peep Shmo Peep. She'll never find us here.
Hi, honey.  They're home.
Hi. This is 706 again. Could you send up some more grass?
Yes, I’ve counted them all and I’m still wide awake.
This better be the best damn nativity scene Saint James has ever seen.
To be honest, I didn't fully think this through when I said I wanted  a less stressful job.
Hi boss, working from home today...
I know it sounds crazy'  but I'm sleeping a lot better
Twelve orders of alfalfa with red clover and one medium burger with fries!
You're right. I won't have a social life until I stop bringing work home.
They are for my bad case of insomnia.
What do you mean you wish I had been a cat lady?
Bo-Peep, call me if you get this message.
As long as Fox News is on, they let me do whatever I want.
Hello, Front Desk?  What channel is Animal Planet?
No, Mom. In New York I am referred to as an Animal Husbandry Technician!
The little one?  Nah, it followed Mary to school.
I  need a different sheep dog.
911? ...no, send a Border Collie!
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lassie.
Yes, I was afraid they'd gone astray, but it turns out they just came in here to watch Fox News.
Yes, I’m cooking tonight. Just bring a nice red that goes with lamb.
I don't care if you can't sleep, I'm not getting the flock out of here.
I may have fewer followers, but I know all of mine personally..
Like hell I've lost my sheep!
Not doing much, just hanging out until price of wool goes up.
I don't know. The dog just brought them in
seriously for the last time, I'm a herder Not a hoarder!!
Hello, Shepard residence.
Finders keepers, Bo.
Hello Mary? They said they are tired of living like animals.
Well, it all started when they followed me to school one day, school one day, school one day ... and I've never been able to shake them since!
Little Bo Peep?  I've found your sheep!
My followers are more the baa humbug type.
Why? Because there's a tariff on wool, but not on sheep.
Yes, they're all here.
Nothing. Just shepherding.
I didn't get the raise, but now I can work from home 2 days a week
Tell Bo Peep that I found them.
I'm not kidding! There's wolf across the street waving at me!
Hello? Ya, Mary it happened again.
I bought a hat and crook and the rest just followed.
Well, mutton is happening over here.
There were too many wolves near Wall Street today so I couldn
Hi - is this Miss BoPeep?
Herbie’s Urban Sheep Herding ... uh-huh ... how many head? ... can I put you on hold? ... Herbie’s Urban Sheep Herding ... Tribeca? ... how many head?
The urban farming thing is a bust.
I’ve got ‘em Bo Peep. Now how about that finder’s fee?
That’s right Warden, five years of experience working with crooks.
Melatonin, ambien, sheep nothing works, Doc. Help me I havn't slept well since the 2016 elections!
Here? Just me and the staff. How about you?
Man, I need to get the flock out of town.
Sorry but I'm having trouble with my staff.
Yes, that’s right—twelve orders of that kind of grass, and one order of the other kind.
Hello, Room Service, I'll take 35 salads, dressing on the side.
They said they came to New York to make it. Typical herd mentality.
Traffic was fine, but herding them on to the F Train was a nightmare.
I woudn't necessarily call the view pastoral.
Yeah, I found the key under the door mat. Say, you don't mind if I have a few friends over?
A rent controlled, third floor walk up seemed like a good idea at the time.
Sadly, I only have twelve followers.
Sorry I missed your earlier call. I was woolgathering.
Local, fresh, AND streetwise...
Hey! Bopeep, I found the sheep!
They followed me home from school.
Front desk? When I said I wanted a quiet room where I could count sheep I didn't mean it literally!"
Yes I get out Ma. In fact I just came in from a day at the park with friends.  It’s like you think I’ll turn into some weird old cat lady.
Have you heard of vertical farming?
Hello? Bo Peep? Guess what?
Apparently, she DID know where to find them.
I've even tried real sheep - but Trump still keeps me awake.
The pay is good, and working from home is encouraged.
We are at our winter quarters
I'm serious this time. He's got grey hair, a beard, and his name is Wolf
Yes-party of 12, and you do have grass on the menu?
Guaranteed,yes ma'am. You'll be asleep within five minutes. See you at 10:00PM.
I know it doesn't make sense, but I think that the black sheep of the family ... is me!
Oh, Bo, my suggestion is that you just leave them alone. They'll come home.
No I don’t think I’ll have a problem falling asleep.
Surprisingly, I've been having trouble falling asleep lately.
NOT better than Ambien.
It's just not the same here, Mom...
Nothing much - just finished some work I had to take home.
I just made the co-op board sweaters for Christmas so  everything’s fine now ...
I've come in from the fold.
You won't believe where I found them.
I don’t know, say 4 pizzas?
There are 11 of them, doc, but I still can’t sleep.
My sheep-counting service is going bust. This city never sleeps.
Sorry honey,I'm watching the kids.
Go to my website and you can be counting them as soon as tonight
That's right. Fifteen large pizzas with extra clover.
Telecommuting has its drawbacks.
The rod and staff? Sure, they comfort me, but not as much as Netflix.
Operator, this is Little Bo. Can you patch me through to Animal Control ? I found them!
I told you the hipsters want locally made wool.
I wish I'd never found them.
Oh yeah! And where did Mary go?
Yeah, Bo, they're right here.  Should I tell them you overslept?"
Yeah, Bo, I found them.  Now come get them!
Oh, and almost forgot - for those 50 side salads, hold the dressing on 49 of them.
Sixteen sheep. Yeah, I’m still wide awake.
11... still awake.... Now what?
Oh, it's ewe.
Sleep......I told the super that I wanted lots of sleep in my new apartment.
Were lost but now are found, Bo.
Doc, do you have another solution.  I still can't sleep.
Not much, ewe?
Yes, I thought they meant "cheap" as well
Turns out wool knitting is a gateway hobby
You were right, they DID come home wagging their tails behind them.
Hotel? No, I'm staying at an AirBaaNBaa.
Yo Peep, found your sheep
I titled my autobiography "My Life with a Crook" and sent it to my publisher. Next thing I know is they have me living in Trump Tower.
Bringing my work home with me is beginning to be a problem.
Sorry, I'm a bit behind on your sweater order.
Okay, just let me change and get the flock out of here.
Just ewe and a few others
Yes, Dr. Conroy, I did stop counting several hours ago!
Well, they can't say that anymore; I found every one of 'em!
Sorry, Dad. I thought you said to go with the flock yourself, and never come back.
I’m working from home.
But doctor, I'm still wide awake!
Yes, I followed your instructions exactly, but the insomnia seems to be even worse now...
They wanted to watch Fox News
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three flats full.
It's not just one lost sheep...it's all of us."
I've left for greener pastures.
Let me call you back. I’m meeting with my staff on work-life balance.
12 Lemongrass Salads without the lemon please
Just counting sheep. What's up with you?
No, it's just a part time job.
I don't know...I just got tired of all that outdoor work.
Yes, I specifically requested a room with a ewe.
Yeah, I agreed to change my career, but I never agreed to move,     
  did I?
It's Peep, P-e-e-p, and I'm knee deep in . . . yes, I'll hold.
Bo-Peep, they've come home.
So I finally broke down and bought a Staff the other day, and the strangest things has happened.
A kid'll eat ivy, to
Of course, they're work related!
It's not bad for a sheep hotel.
Some people think I'm crazy, but if you're a sheep person, you totally get it.”
Goddammit Alexa, I said "drone strike" not "clone sheep."
Hey is this the building manager? The United States electorate is in my apartment. And none of us know where the remote is.
Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep, and you won’t believe the apartment they found.
When I asked room service for something for someone who couldn’t sleep, this is not what I expected.
Hello, UberEats? I think there has been a misunderstanding?
I'm sorry - Ms Peep is out right now.
I hate when I run out of Ambien.
Yes, that's right, and a bale of alfalfa.
It all worked out.  The chickens are in the other​ bedroom and the goats are in the kitchen.
Gonna work from home today, boss.
have to be brief - witness protection - i'm on the lamb
OK.  Now how do I get the flock outta here?
Twenty-seven salad bars have told me not to come back.
You can stop searching for them Siri. I left them alone and they came home, wagging their tails behind them.
I dunno Marty, I thought the whole 'crazy cat lady' thing had become a bit of a bore.
but your Airbnb listing says 'pet friendly'
Yes, I take them to the park twice a day... sheering is extra.
You would not believe the subway this morning.
We're watching Shepard Smith on Fox.
Sorry, can’t come. I’m feeling a bit sheepish today’.
Hello? , Insomnia Hotline?
He's already asleep. What do I do now?
Can you get the flock out of here?
I'm just watching the game with a few friends - what's up with ewe?
Wall Street doesn't have those kinds of wolves, mom.
I used to count them to fall asleep but now I find they make it easier to get through crowds and cross the street.
OK. Line up, I'm sleepy.
I’m flocked!
It works!!! I left them alone, and they came home!
Two eggs, over easy, a side of hash browns, and five bushels of silage.
Yeah, I thought I had lost them, but it turns out they had just blended in with the carpet
We need to find a place that allows dogs.
Yes, dear, lamb chops again.
I'm telling you -- I just left them alone.
They really did come home, wagging their tails behind them.
There is more money in the insomnia business in NYC than herding in Idaho.
Your farm-to-table order is ready.
Bo Peep lost her sheep? More fake news!
Can I have the number for Bo Peep?
Yes, I bought a full-service sleep sofa on sale.  Yes, there is some maintenance involved.
They don’t like him either
All right, have it your way.  You heard a lamb bleat.
Do you hear what I hear?
Hello room service, could I get all the mint jelly you have?
The Border Collies are stuck in traffic, so I turned on the Sheep Channel...
I appreciate the gesture, but I said I needed to catch some SLEEP.
Yes, this is Big Bo Peep. 
No, I have not lost anything.
Yes, I know we have a diversity issue here.
I wanted a fleece frock, not a flock!
I do love these urban getaways, but find it difficult not to take work with me.
I’m sorry, we are not able to locate your pasture at this time.  Please stay on the line and an operator will be with you shortly.”
Just through the week-end, then back to the fields.
I'm a Shepherd, I do - not - need - to - count - them!
I'm surrounded by bahd news
She said she needs space for her stuff, she can’t live with a herder anymore.
The pay and the medical benefits are great! But, I do have to bring work home sometimes.
If anyone in the hotel is having trouble falling asleep, I can help out.
Sorry, honey. I guess I must have fallen asleep!
I think it's time we move on to greener pastures.
No Mary, I told you I have no idea where they are, you have to stop being so suspicious.
I think you may have had a point when you said I take my work home with me.
OK Bo Peep, I understand all that, but you did't lose them, and it's going to cost plenty to get 'em back.
Much to our dismay, apparently they no longer allow sheep in Sheep Meadow.
Hey, one of you named 'Lambchops'? There's a Miss Lewis on the phone looking for you.
My wife keeps telling me not to bring my work home.”
Not much. This is my mandatory "work from home" day.
Nice accommodations, but the "pet-friendly" charges really add up on a per-head basis.
Hey, Bo here, just hanging out with my peeps.
No. Just chilling, watching "The Silence of the Lambs'
Nothing much. You?
Hear me! My insomnia is gone!
The toughest part was getting them all on the same elevator
No, you can’t watch the Rams game.
I've already tried counting sheep.
I counted them already so I’m taking a break.
I'm beginning to think my commute wasn't so bad after all.
Honey,we forgot the mint jelly!
My wife tells me to stop bringing my work home!
Yup, I said I'd like one shepherd's pie and fifty six large salads please. Oh, and hold the dressing.
Hi, I'd like one wolf
I can’t talk for long. They get upset when I pause the movie.
When you asked me to babysit your kids I thought they were human.
Oh, nothing much, just some woolgathering . . . How about you?
Hello, housekeeping...You're not going to believe this...
Yeah, the cars are a nuissance but there are fewer wolves.
Hi.  This is Joseph.  I'm calling in to let you know that I will be working from home today.
Han's sleep aids, how may I help you?
hello...can I speak to Little Bo Peep?
You say the wolf's at the door?
Hello room service.  It seems you have double booked my room.
Send up a burger and 50 lbs. of grass.
Yeah, I'll recount.
I've counted them over and over and I still can't get to sleep.
Yeah, the city's nice, but job opportunities are shockingly limited.
A million dollars in unmarked bills and a helicopter by 5 pm...or I start sending chops!
Tech support?  My guests are getting restless because I can't connect to EweTube TV.
But how do I get them to stop following me?
The what?! Wolf of Wall Street?
Yes, mom - I've tried counting sheep.
Yes, I'm awake.  Just as I started to nod off, I ran out of sheep.
Can you shear me now?
I really don't think I can dogsit for you.
Ms. Bopeep?  Yes, it's me again.
Hello, Mr. MacDonald?  I'm going to take a work-at-home day today.
Yes, I tried counting
What the flock?
Yeah, ever since the co-op board allowed that wolf to purchase 19G, everyone seems a bit on edge.
Yeah, Mary's out of town and I'm house sitting.
Chic? Oy! I thought you said urban sheep.
I'm afraid that if I start counting them now, I won't make it to the end of the game.
Just to be on the safe side, cancel the lamb chop special, I'll have a large Greek salad."
Yes,we are all binging "Breaking Baaaahd."
Can I get an upgrade from loft to manger.
Tell Harold I'm working from home today
Hazel, this is the last time I'll say it:  Take your things and get the flock out of here
Sorry. The flock of seagulls is on the tenth floor.
Hold on, they all want to talk to you.
Bo, they're here...Hilton Chicago Rm.1300
I'd like to place an order for 9 jars of mint jelly.
I’m getting totally fleeced on this place.
Mary shows up and baada baada baada I'm having breakfast at her apartment.
Yes, Mom, I came down off the mountain.
Yes, I did find them...I left them alone and they went home, and now they are watching Netflix.
Yeah, this shepherding thing is more of a part-time gig ... until my screenplay gets picked up.
I’m just in for the holidays. Mom’s got an attitude as usual.
Any suggestions how to decide which ones are wolves in sheep’s clothing?
Hi, Yes, they are all here and Fox News is on.
Well, flock you, too.
Never mind. I found 'em.
Yeah, so it turns out they rented a suite here at The Plaza with your credit card.
My peeps will get back to your peeps.
Jerry, do you know anyone in the neighborhood who delivers grass?
Let me talk to Bo Peep, I think I’ve found them !
Don't worry, I didn't lose them this time
I’m apartment sitting at Bo’s this weekend, sorry fellas.
Mary? Have I got a surprise for you!
Find that dog!
Bo, I found your sheep. They're watching the Rams game.
Wagging their tails as usual, the bastards.
Hey Bo.  They're home! Never thought they'd find us in Brooklyn.
No Wolf Blitzer. We prefer Shepard Smith.
I feel a little sheepish calling you this late, but I can't seem to fall asleep.
I think I’ll switch back to dog walking after all.
No I wasn't sleeping, I was just counting sheeps"
I work from home 3 days a week.
We got gentrified... deal with it!
It's my day off.
Our vacations going great! Tomorrow we're going to Times Square to get fleeced!
I happened to mention the great grass I've got stashed under my bed and they followed me home!
When I said I wanted all natural wool, this wasn't what I meant!
Fleeced again!
No,I found them. The Rams game was about to start.
You up...?
I tried that, but they came home anyway.
Get my agent on the line, I got an idea: 'Sheep in the City'
They're not like my old roommates -- I can always count on these guys.
It’s $100 for the first hour and $30 for each additional 15 minutes.
I've got mutton going on as usual.
I was just dozing off when you called.
I'm canceling the farmshare.
Let's just say there's a bunch of them, it's counter-productive to try and ascertain the exact number.
That's "P-e-e-p," and I need to remove the "lost sheep" bulletin, immediately.
Sorry I meant to tell you I'd work from home today. My baad.
Yo, Bo!  Your peeps have come home.
Time to get the flock outta here
Turns out our sheepdog has a trust fund.
I’m so slammed at work I had to bring some home with me.
9, 10, 11...Oh rats, they all moved again.
No, everything's fine.
However the benefit of a smaller apartment is that you can't lose them as easily.
Sure it's not as much space as back home, but we really like the energy here.
Why not?  Goat yoga worked.
I think I am just going to work from home today
I think I have them all now,  but I can’t seem to count them without falling asleep.
Urban Shepherd
You guys want takeout?
The doctor says it’s not about me. It’s about ewe.
Dear - did you order sheep from Amazon or has our Corgi learned a new trick?
I pointed out that, technically, they are not pets so what could they do?
You've got exactly 24 hours to come up with the ransom, Ms. Bo-Peep.....or else!
Bo who?
At Shephard dot com you can tend your flock from the comfort of your own home office
I can't make it today.  I'm working from home.
I just closed my eyes for a minute.
I herd ewes.
Their days of being counted between midnight and dawn are over, they say. It's a muttony.
To sheep, to sheep. Perchance to dream.
Unfortunately the mangers are all full, so they put us in the luxury suite.
I'll be honest with you, urban sheperding isn't working out as well as I would have thought.
10 pounds of grass really isn't a lot for me
Hey mom. I can't get these sheep to leave.
They think I'm Donald Trump. What should I do?
Very relaxing, thanks. I count them every night.
NO, MARY'S NOT HOME!!. She said she'd be right back and that was 2 weeks ago.
Hello, Nativity Scenes R Us. Out of donkeys, got plenty of lambs. May I take your order?
I know, Mom. They said to bring samples of my work.
Hey Bo... you'll never guess where I found them.
Two Questions, how much is your sod per square foot and do you deliver?
So the elevator was a good clue we were lost.
NOT NOW, I'm about to take a nap.
I can’t sleep without them.
And then they told me we have to use the service elevator from now on.
This telecommuting thing just isn't working out like I'd hoped.
Hello, Grubhub, I want a 100 pounds of clover.
Well, in a way, I guess you could say it's a dream come true...
Maybe it's mean but we're all kind of happy the dog couldn't make it this year.
Mary said she was just going out for a pack of smokes.
Listen Bo Peep--I DID leave them alone. But 
I thought they were supposed to go to YOUR home.
The sheep are so disappointed. There's no big apple.
Hello Room Service: I'd like to order a club sandwich, chips, a soda and 80 pounds of hay.
Well, they came home again, and the co-op board is not happy.
Yes I’m certain some are missing. I’m still awake, aren’t I?
Once you go with a live manger scene , you can never go back to ceramics!
Turns out I wasn't born to be a shepherd.
So why is it called Park Avenue?
Yes, I know.  I'm flocked.
Of course I tried counting sheep!
Could you send up a Shepherd's Pie with a side of lemongrass for 12?
It's just me and the guys havin' a little EweTube party
I told you not to get wool carpet. The flock is holding a protest.
Hey this is Big Bo Peep....Yeah I found them
1,2,3,4.....aw heck I’ll take a sleeping pill.
11. Now what?
They're locally owned and very much homegrown.
Hoo boy! When they say the lambs were “sure to go,” they weren’t kidding!
Maybe downsizing wasn't such a good idea after all
Yeah, she left me because I keep bringing my work home every night.
I get it, we all want to be counted!
Bo Peep,try 740 Park Ave. 8th floor.
...and they just bleat like the dickens if I switch off Fox News
Not much.  Just watching a little Ewe-Tube.
Bo Peep Residence
Hello, is this Border Collies-R-Us?
The sleeping pills didn't work.
No, mom, I'm not doing the sheep thing again.
May I call you back? I'm leading a staff retreat.
Not a Peep from Bo...
Doctor, I have a problem. Everytime I try to count my sheep, I fall alseep.
Bo Peep?  Yeah, found 'em.
I'm sorry Mary, you can't keep taking them to school.
Do you sell organic grass and do you deliver to 72nd and Broadway?
Oh, same old stuff.  Work, mortgage, baah baah baah . . .
Yes sir... yes sir... three pounds full.
I think I'm being followed.
I specialize in advanced sleep studies.
Make that one large with cheese and 19 with clover.
Tell Little Bo Peep I have her Goddamn sheep.
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. Would you like paper or plastic?
Hello front desk, I would like to complain about a terrible smell in my room.
Hello!  Is Little Bo Peep there?
They demanded to watch the Rams vs. the Lions
This is Bo.. you won't believe where I finally found them ! .
"This is apartment is such a bad deal. I'm getting fleeced.
Remote working helps my team avoid that corporate herd mentality.
And then it was suggested I try counting sheep.
Tell Bo-Peep that I DESERVED that promotion!
First time I've stayed in a SheepBnB. It's great!
Mind if I work from home today?
Why am I selling?  Because with my new c-pap machine I no longer need them!
Hello, roam service?
Stay-at-home shepherd speaking. Can I help you?
They disagree about the apartment having a pastoral quality.
This AirBaa-n-Baa is perfect.
Oh yeah? Flock ewe!
You remember that book, “Urban Shepherd” you gave me for my last birthday?
This is Bo.  Peep's in the shower.
The usual. What about you?
The farmer's market wasn't quite as welcoming as we anticipated.
It's very nice here, but I seem to have trouble sleeping.
My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.  John 10:27-28.  Does the condo board have any other questions?
You graze your way, I graze my way.
Yes, that's one l-a-m-b souvlaki with a side of potatoes. Actually, I think I better just head down there.
The kids tell me Bo-Peep took off right after I passed out.
Pen to penthouse… it's like farm to table.
Twenty tickets for Shear Madness, please.
And how much for the extra RAM?
After switching to Xanax, I decided to keep them. Because they're family, Jack!
Insomnia Crisis -line. How may I help you?
No mom, I don’t think the recount is going to help me sleep any better.
Yo, Bo.  Found your sheep.
I don’t see what the problem is, I told you I’d be using your Airbnb to work from home.
Parks Department? I own an environmentally friendly mowing service...
Sorry, I've been swamped.  I had to take some work home with me.
Please come home. I promise I'll get rid of them.
I found some surprising relatives on my DNA test.
Didn't sleep a wink. Perhaps you could send up more sheep.
GPS  says  that  this  is  where the meadow  is.
I'm more productive when I work from home
Hey Bo, bad news, we are being evicted."
Yes, I found them.  They're in a nice Airbnb, and they apologize for using your credit card.
What channel is the The Shari Lewis Show on?
Forthe last time -- the Lord is thy shepherd!!!!
Well, once word got out that 'Babe' is on TV again, there was no stopping them.
I’d like to order some real grass.
„Mom, If I make it in NY, I can make it anywhere...“
Is this Central Park? I've got a proposition for you ...
Sorry, we don't do insomniacs.  It's too hard on the sheep.
Not much. Just counting sheep.
Bo Peep? I think I found 'em
I think I just got fleeced.
Hello, yes this Mr. Peep.  No, Bo is not here right now.  I don’t know where she is.
Weren't you the one who told me to invest in wool futures?
I don’t know how many,if I try to count them I might fall asleep
That new dog?  He needs some training.
Hi- do you have a sheepdog who does house calls?
I don't think I'll go, I'm feeling kind of sheepish.
Hello. I was wondering if you deliver green pastures?
I TRIED going on vacation... work just keeps following me!
Is Bo Peep available?
Peep. P, E, E, P. Bo. B, O.
It's a great gig.  I'm their emotional companion.
This was funnier when Wallace and Gromit did it.
Are you sure counting sheep is the best way to fall asleep?
Hello, Bo Peep, I think I have solved your problem.
The 'Silence of the Lambs' is not as soothing as I thought.
You were right, Doc. Counting Trump's bad decisions is much more practical.
Tell Bo they found greener pastures
No, no, it's not me it's ewe.
Housekeeping ???
I thought working from home would create better work-life balance.
Yes, that’s one hamburger and  one acre of grass.
So I said “ let’s get some sleep”, and the next thing I know...
Twenty bucks a head and I'll send them on home, Bo Peep.
No, you must be thinking of Bo Derek.
Sharon, never count sheep on Ambien...
Lost? Nah. I’m at my brother’s in the city watching the game.
They don't know it yet, but we're about to get fleeced.
Hello, you have reached By Hook or By Crook, how can I help ewe?
They're fine -- Not a Peep out of them.
No, I'm not busy. Come over. I'm literally just counting sheep.
I told the desk I wanted a good sleep
Hello, do you have a listing for “Little Bo Peep”
When I say "who  wants to go for a W A L K " they all get excited.
You're telling me there isn't a single venture capital firm interested in an urban sheepherding startup?
An expentant couple took over, men started bringing gifts, it just got too crowded.
I left them alone and they came home!
Don't tell me the wolves got the Central Park view!
...and one egg roll. Please don't forget the c-h-o-p sticks.
Teleshepherding - I'm telling, you it's the next big thing.
I've gathered the wool. Now what?
Mary? She's out with one of  the little lambs.
Hello, Bo?  Yes, I found them all.
Hello, Bo Peep? You'll never believe where I found them!
Hi Bo- Peep. Thanks for a wonderful evening last night but do you mind collecting your sheep.
Miss Bo Peep?, I have someone here who would like to talk with you.
I’ll be sheepless in Seattle next time, I promise.
The landlord is my shepherd . . .
Yes, room service? I'd like to order a shepard's pie and 5 bales of hay.
I'd like to place an order for a very large grass and clover pizza.
Assembled outside the Seventh Street polling site, they started and kept following me no matter what I said.
I'll have the General Tso and two acres of green pastures.
Found 'em, you won't believe where!
Guten tag, I’m answering your flyer looking for a German Shepard
Yes Mom, I made them take off their shoes at the door
Some Silicon Valley billionaire hired us to put his kid to sleep. Gig economomy, right?
I was tired of being outstanding in my field.
They followed me home, Mary.
 Now what?
He did what? Get the flock outta here!
Well, now they've seen Paree.
You were totally right — the hipsters here LOVE my ‘Artisanal Ambien’.
Yes, that's right . . . ten cubic yards of sod, 25th floor, penthouse suite.
This 3D television is something else.
...barely hear you… noisy here… try counting what?
Yea, I actually found it on Air-bah-n-bah!
New York, the city that never sleeps or the place where dreams come true?
Can I call you baaaaack?
Working from home is not without its drawbacks.
There's at least 13 of them, but how's this going to help me sleep?
I'd like to speak to Miss BoPeep.
Well, I was following the GPS...
Tell Little Bo I found them.
Binge-watching my sheep.
Turns out there was no wolf after all.
One medium pepperoni and six extra large with clover and hay.
I do herd a lot of sheep but that doesn't make me a hoarder.
Bo Peep? I think I can help with your little problem.
What?  Sorry.  I had just fallen asleep.
The office is nice and the job is pretty easy, but the uniform is really wonky.
You dream, We come.
I was hoping to get some sleep, but all they want to do is watch Fox News . . .
I’d like to order the 3 bails for $30 special.
I'm in 507 requesting housekeeping 24/7.
Dave, this party is shear madness.
hello! Mid-town sheep rescue...how can I help?
Where did you say that damn dog went......?
We haven’t found a producer yet, but there’s a lot of interest.
I tried counting sheep but its too much like work.
So what’s going on with ewe?
Yeah, I already tried that, but I still can't sleep.
We're in town for an Insomniacs Anonymous meeting .
Hey Greg, I've got the sheep. Do I just start counting them, or...?
Bo, I got ‘em but, you’ll never guess where!
You were right, city life is more convenient.
Working from home is nothing like Camila said it would be.
We're binge-watching, just like everybody else
They're better than cats , they dont ignore me.."
My rod and my DVR, they comfort me.
Good news, dear! I found an easier way to get rid of the carpets and get down to the hardwood floors.
Dear Little Bo P.,
So sorry for unfriending you.
Can we talk things over?
I finally got my sheep together.
This is shear madness, I tell you!
I'm at the Fields' for the night, you know, just keeping watch.
If I can't find him it's no big deal, I've got 99 others just like him.
Hey, you up?
Just sitting down for "So Ewe Think Ewe Can Dance".
Of course I know pets are not allowed.  They're livestock.
No, Bo Peep is out looking for her sheep. This is the baby sitter
The dog brought us up here and then ran off.
Hi...Bo?  I found them!
I can't sleep. I need more sheep.
Can I please get a prescription of Ambien now?
What do you mean the wolf of Wallstreet is back?
She can't talk.  All creatures great and small is on now.
I couldn't sleep so I summoned my staff.
The noise in the background; That's my sleep medication
Yeah, my Sunday flock came over to watch the big game.
Bo-Peep here...no, I definitely haven't lost them...
I love working from home, Mom, I'm my own boss.
We offer upscale grazing for the modern ewe.
They ewe-nionized.
Bo Peep, I've found the sheep and got us a room----hurry on over!!
My therapist said temporary regression, like clinginess, is totally normal after a big move, but sometimes I just wish they'd get lost.
I miss the countryside, but the flock is all hooked on Netflix.
Tell me again why this will help me sleep?
After the litter box training it was easy
Many wolves roaming around Wall Street today? The flock wants some fresh air.
I counted and counted until I got an overflow error.  That woke me up.
Found 'em. We're having a staff bleating."
I don't really care, do Ewe?
Hello, insomnia emergency hotline.
Lassie come home. Cable's not working.
Great location, fabulous views, just across the street from Central Park, but a little cramped.
So, I met this girl, Little Bo-Peep.
I thought the prize was a Jeep Wrangler...I don’t know anything about being a sheep wrangler??!!
I think someone's trying to pull the wool over my eyes.
I won’t show them Fox.”
I'm not so sure this "telecommuting" thing is right for me.
I'll have a large cheese and twelve sides of grass.
Hey Donald...I found them.
That's right - one cheese pizza and a hundred pounds of grass and clover!
Don't tell Mary where we are... this is gonna be the best surprise!
Hello, Mary. You said you were paying me to watch your ONE little lamb.
Yes sir! All 12 are certified fence jumpers.
Hey, it's Little Bo. You would not believe where I found them!
All I told them was, ‘Let’s make America great again’.
Hi. I'd like to order out for a party of 14. Anything but lamb chops.
Yes, I 'll take the EZ-Shear. And that's one day delivery, right?
Yes, Ms. Bo-Peep. I found them.
No, we have another counting then. How's 1:30 a.m. for you?
We start tomorrow as part of the natural landscaping program in Central Park.
I just don’t why I keep falling asleep.
I miss ewe too
Yes, we all finished voting and are watching the returns.
I know it can get messy, but counting the imaginary ones never got me to sleep.
Bo-Peep, I can't find the remote.
I'm the in the penthouse, baby.  Call me Big Bo Peep.
I'm still not sleepy!  Will you send over five more sheep?
City life just isn’t for me.
Oh, you meant upstate? That'll be extra.
I got money on the Rams...
My GPS was a little off.  I'm across the street from the Sheep Meadow.
Hey boss, I thought I'd give this working from home thing a try.
Baa, baa, baa, baa Barbara Ann?
It's getting to the point where I can't tell the tweeting from the bleating.
I’ve got your sheep, Little Bo Peep!
I think they're all here but I keep falling asleep when try and count them.
I know, I know, I didn’t think I’d get so many followers!
They may be a little TOO domesticated.
I think we might be taking the whole "artisanal" thing a little too far.
They won't stop bleating until I put on The Wolf of Wall Street
Hey, Bo-Peep, they're home, now what?
Do I have a staff? Sure I've got a staff , who would you like to speak with"
I think I’ll work from home today.
A white male, fluffy hair; have you seen him?"
What can I say? They love 'Fox and Friends.
I'd love a dog but unfortunately my landlord won't let me have  a pet.
You can’t miss him, officer; he has three full bags. Well, he self identifies as gray.
...and a pair of knitting needles.
"For goodness' sake, Mary, get yourself home now!"
The best part of working from home is you never have to get out of your bathrobe.
Actually, I solved the sheep dog problem
There's no more grazing in Central Park
Mom an d Dad, I want to quit the family business.
No, sorry this is her older brother Big Bo-Peep.
Hello room service? Could you send up your salmon carpaccio with lemon aioli, a nice oaked chardonnay and a creme brûlée for dessert. Oh, and a large bail of your very best hay.
Smart TV: I said Sleep
I have a message for Miss Peep.
It's actually the one where Lassie saves a bunch of sheep.
Where again was the right turn?
Hey, Bo Peep, I was just wondering if you're doing anything tonight.
I brought my work home with me today but I keep falling asleep.
I really need to stop taking my work home with me
Tell Little Bo Peep I found them.
I can assure you that the wool coats that I am offering are genuine."
I've rallied their trust, but now it's like they expect me to actually lead them somewhere. I don't understand.
Oh, we're safe.  He will never look in his own building.
They had a special — sheep stay free if accompanied by a shepherd
That's when I realized I was letting the sheep herd me.
Apparently the building has a ‘No dog’ policy. The herd’s a mess
Never again! That's the last time I cover for Little Bo-Peep.
It's ok. I finally found them.
You didn’t say the job had to be in the country.
No, I sold the beehives. 2019 is all about urban sheephearding.
You're right, Sheepshead Bay is much more peaceful than Manhattan.
No, It was not a sheepless night
No, this is the Los Angeles Lambs.... but we are waiting for the Rams too.
Hi mom, i couldn’t sleep
I assure you, my eBay account was hacked, I did not order a herd of sheep with a free Shepard's crook!.
Morning Helen. Tell him I'm working from home today.
Yes, I know"winter is coming". We are all set!
It was raining, so I got us a hotel room.
Hi Bo Peep! Guess what?
This working from home has its pros..... and its cons.
I've counted them ten times. Can you think of anything else I could do with them to put me to sleep?
Quit calling me a dog. I’m a German Shepherd.
So, when do you expect to have more Ambien?
Speak to a representative.
Nothing was said about this on AirB& B.
"I have literally tried counting sheep but, I still can't sleep!"
Bo Peep? Boy Blue here. I think I know where your lost sheep are.
Yes, that's exactly what I herd.
Screw the sheep, I'm buying my woolen socks online!
I've got to get the flock out of the city.
Hello? I’m looking for a Bo Peep.
Oh, just kicking back until shearing season gets here. You?
I can’t leave until Bo comes back.
They follow me around like a bunch of damn sheep.
Yeah, I 'very decided to work from home today.
Hey, Larry. Remember when I told you I was able to book the Jean Shepherd Suite at the Comedy Hotel?
For the last time, you can't rent my sheep for a stupid sleeping experiment.
2A had outdoor space but no view.
I just have to give each of the condo Board members a sweater.
Hello, Wilburn Sod Farm? Do you deliver?
Just waiting for the dog to come back with pizza.  You?
Netflocks and chill?
They also would like to be returned
Is Dad still having trouble sleeping? If so I can come over.
Hi, Mary.  No, there's not a little lamb in the bunch.
Help me, get the flock outta here!
What do you mean you're out of mangers?
Hello,  Miss Bo Peep?   I think I found what you lost, and I would 
 be GLAD, make that ecstatic, to tell you where to find them.
Mary?  Yes, it’s the boy down the lane again.
Airbnb has changed my life.
I left them alone as you said and they came home.
Oh, Hi Peep. Not much. How about you?
Of course, I tried  counting sheep, I count them every every night!
They told me I was buying a Sleep Number 12.
It's much cozier, and we all agree, safer.
The Wolf of Wall Street? Not what I expected.
No, these aren't pets, I work from home.
Yes, Peep.  First name’s Bo.
Before I book the room, are you sure you're a pet friendly hotel?
I'm getting a dog.
I'm working on a plan to bridge the urban-rural divide.
Mutton. What are you up to?
Tomorrow works better for me. I’m working from home today.
You’re coming for dinner? Can you bring a bottle of Mouton Cadet?
Hello. You have reached Party Animals. Mary speaking.
Ms. Bo Peep, you say? Can you describe your lost sheep, m'am?
Yes, I’ve  trained them to count. 
But I still can’t sleep.
You'll never guess who followed me home.
Ever since election day they demand to be counted but I keep falling asleep
I'm going to try a homeopathic solution to my insomnia.
Hello Mary, I think you better get over here!
No, mum. I am not in a codependent relationship.
Bleating?  There's no bleating, it's the TV.
Little Bo Peep, this is detective Jones, I think we have solved the case.
Wrong number. This isn't Andy Shepherd. I'm just A Shepherd.
Yea, I lost one. Would you check the meadow in the lobby?
This natural sleep aid is not working.
I'm on hold for a Ms. Bo Peep.
I keep telling them to get lost.
The dog quit and I can't find another one on Linkedin. Can you get me a temp?
This is actually not helping me go to sleep at all.
Honey, the breeder assured me that these sheep doodles do not shed.
I like to take work home with me.
I trained them to jump over the bed, and now I sleep without pills! The guy downstairs is becomg difficult, though... Need any wool?
We're waiting for the dog to get back from his walk.
Trust me, Bob.  I don’t know why you always think I’m trying to pull the wool over your eyes...
Today?
Not much.
Ewe?
just hanging out, watching some shear nonsense
Hey, Barbara? Last time I "cat-sit" for you.
NYC is such a livable city once you learn to separate the sheep from the goats.
Nope, still can't sleep.
Herding cats? Now that's hard work!
I think they are happy with the room.
Like any good urban minister, I'm multi-tasking, catching the game and tending to my flock.
Hello Airbnb? The lawn looked much bigger online!
No, sheepherder is not a pseudonym.
No Janet, I told you I was working from home today. It’s on my Outlook calendar.
What do you mean all I ever say is, “Bah, Bah, Bah?”
I guess I fell asleep at 25.
Apparently, the suit comes "some assembly required".
Yes sir, I can hear you’re upset but I promise you I actually said flock of ewes”.
To go after prominent abusive shepherd leaders, they want lawyers and a social media agency working under #ewetoo.
Sleep? Do you know what sleep smells like?
I'm feeling too sheepish to go out.
"But the Airbnb listing said pets allowed.
They LOVE Times Square.
Oh, I've adapted pretty well to the new place, but the sheep are having a rougher time.
The only P.E. course left was Urban Sheepherding.
Yes, I'm calling about constantly getting fleeced on my data plan.
The Andersons are coming for dinner. Remember the mint jelly.
I don't know how many, I lost count...
But, the ad said pets allowed.

Hello 911 ?  I need some help getting the flock outta here

I promise you there’s lots more work to do here. The city never sleeps!
Everyone quiet down, I'm on the phone with the landlord.
Yeah, tell BoPeep her sheep are here with me, and it will cost her to get them back!!
I tried counting them but I’m still awake.
Your household cleaning service came highly recommended...can you come today?
I honestly can't tell them apart.

I love New York, but for some reason I didn't get any sleep last night.
The auditor should be here in about 15 minutes.   Can you believe that they're actually questioning my entitlement to a farm subsidy?
Look, I woulda liked a larger suite too, but when it came to booking criteria, I made an executive decision that the hotel’s emotional support animal policy was the most important thing.
I said, 'I need to get some sleep'.
Yes, a bale of forbs with a side of clover, please, and I'll have the lamb chops. Rare.
Oh you haven't herd? Me and the boys are on the lamb.
I think I've taken this insomnia cure thing a couple of steps too far.
This Little Bo Peep has lost lots of sleep.
Guys, it doesn't look good for the Rams."
But if I close my eyes, it’s impossible to count them!
All the reviews said this place is close to a great watering hole.
I think your new show is a hit. They are flocking to see it.
I’m going to be working remotely today.
Well, when I said "ewe-all" oughta drop by, I meant "ya'll".

Yes, my family and I love your place!  I was just wondering where you keep the clover.
Holy sheep. Get the flock outta here...
'Yes, this is Mrs. Bo Peep... Oh no don't worry I've found them'
I should finally get a good night’s sleep.
Well, yes, I am feeling a little sheepish about this.
Yes Mom, I remember I always swore I would never bring my work home like Dad did but I really love it and my insomnia is completely gone!
No, I can't help you fall asleep.
What do you mean? I should count them?
I have counted them several times already and I am still awake!
Seriously, Bo-Peep? You can't find them?
Yes, of course I tried Febreeze.
Sorry about the noise. Perhaps YOU should try counting sheep
I've heard of landlords fleecing their tenants but this is ridiculous!
Pardon my accent, gentleman, 
but what I asked for was a C-H-E-A-P delivery!
Who said this is the city that never sheeps?
I know the lease said no pets, but how would they find out?
Hello? Little Bo Peep?  I think I have something that belongs to you.

Yo, Peep, it's your worst nightmare. Meet me in the meadow with a million dollars, alone, or they won't be bringing their tails behind them, if you get my drift.
I still can't sleep!  Could you send in some more of your friends?

Miss Peep? Miss Bo Peep?  Well, I may have found your sheep.
Guess what?  The landlord deleted the no pets clause.
Of course I'm at work Honey. I'm aghast you'd even think I'd sneak back in to watch the season finale without you .
We have plenty of milk, but we're out of grass again.
I may need a patio to start this whole urban farming thing
I thought I would get more done working from home today.
That's right -- eleven sod sushi rolls.

I'm not doing much, just another sleep over.
I like to bring my work home with me.
I am cancelling Netflix. I just can't stay awake long enough to watch a full movie!
The toughest part was getting them all in the elevator !

Tell Bo Peep I found them.
That's not what I herd.
Nothing much, just the usual.
No, they're all fine but I lost Bo.

Hello,this is Bo Peep with Natural Sleep Solutions confirming your 10 p.m. appointment.
Have I heard about 13 missing sheep? Ah, no. Not a peep.
Yes, I'd like to order a bell.
I'm watching my flocks by night.
Initially I brought my work with me when I relocated, but now I use them mainly to treat my insomnia.

"What do you mean, count their legs and divide by four?"
So,Bo Peep, about this custody thing...
That's one platter of crudites and a dozen of alfalfa pellets.
Are you sure this is a work from home position?
I don't know what's worse, this or cockroaches!
Hello, is this shepherd's anonymous?
Mary how did you solve your lamb issues?
It's not that I mind counting them...I just hate to take care of them all night too!
Oh, not much. What’s up with ewe?
Not much. Just watching the Rams clobber the Lions.
I'm in 310.  Do you happen to have a shaver I could borrow?
So my workers’ comp claim was denied.  Turns out I just have narcolepsy.
Yes.  I'd like a sitter for thirteen.
This isn’t working.  Got any place with a roof top garden?
I'd like a refund on my Pay-Per-Ewe...
Yo Bo-Peep, your sheep are home, now what?
I can't talk now. The sheep are nervous.
Hello? Bo Peep? About that reward...."
One beef lo mein, pot stickers, spring rolls and two bales of hay.
Listen, Bo Peep, if I can't have healthcare and a raise, you don't get these guys back.
Yes, Air Baa'n'Baa.
Our co-op board is pretty accommodating.
I'm allergic to wool.  And I hate the outdoors.
We like it here, but I still think the GPS was broken.
... but by the time they came home I had already downsized, so here we are...
What do you mean, my son volunteered me to be in his school Christmas pageant?
Yes, this is David. I am working from home today.
Honest, there's no one but ewe.
We decided to binge on  NetFlocks.
I couldn't sleep last night
Well, it would just be me and you, and ewe, and ewe ...
They are going to be slaughtered in broad daylight on Fifth Avenue, but their support for him has not wavered.
Hello? Bo Peep? Yes, they're here. They took the Number 15 bus.
Hello, yes, I've lost my little lamb.
I don’t know, even they’re getting disenchanted with Fox News
The transporter works.
Yes, our analytics absolutely prove that we can capture high mobility, high loyalty followers in an urban demographic.
Peep? I have your lamb chops. What are they worth to you?
Hello, is this Bo-Peep?
Hello, Miss Bo Peep? Did I wake you?
I herd you!
I found them. They're watching "Little Red Riding Hood"
All right, there are eleven.  Now what?
Honey,remember how you are always talking about micro farming,well,guess what?
Yea, I thought it would be easier than herding cats.
No the Flocking app isn't at all like Tinder.
No, seriously Peep.  I haven't seen them.
yeah, they're home ... yeah, they brought their tails behind them
So I figured, why cry wolf when I can just call in sick?
I’ll herd them to the roof in the spring.
Yes, yes, I’ve been counting sheep but it’s not working.
When the realtor said ‘Sheepshead Bay,’ I was expecting something else entirely.
Working from home isn’t as productive as I hoped
No, I am really not a cat person.
No, I tried that too, and I still can't get to sleep.
Who sells grass in this city?
Come on over. Hey, I'll let you pick out a sweater!
Hi Mary.  How would your lamb like company?
The Sheep's Meadow is booked through September. What's available in the Hamptons?
I keep counting sheep like you told me, but I get the sense the sheep don't want me to fall asleep.
Yeah, but the rent's crazy cheap.
I can't do it right now, Mom. I'm working.
Yes, Mary, yours is here.
Something happened while I was counting.
Yeah, we trailed Blacky here.  We’re set for the intervention.
That's right Bo Peep this is your last chance.
Pay up or they're lamb chops.
Things are fine except I had to put the border collie up in the pet hostel because technically it's not a service animal.
I have a client that has a lot of trouble sleeping.
I'm calling my lawyer.  They don't allow black sheep.
Tell the Whiffenpoofs I got'em
Honey, I've returned from my sheepherding sabbatical and I think we need to talk.
Cheap room, sheep room, not much difference!
Just one problem...I find myself oversleeping here.
Hello, Bo Peep?  I found 'em.
Little Bo who?
Hi, is Wolf there?
I'm returning your damn loaner dog
Yep, Reverend Shepard here..ready for the Revival Meeting and I brought along most of my Flock.
No, I don't feel sheepish about it.
Oh nothin', just wool gatherin'
I’m sorry Mr. Peep, but the divorce papers are final.
Yeah hi, was this the hospital I was reading about that was doing that insomnia study?
No, I mean shepherd in the New Year.
Hey Little Bo Peep. ...I found em’
I got fleeced as soon as I got to the city.
I’m sure you can help me sleep, but the AirBnB description is very misleading.
Yo! Bo Peep, I found your sheep.
Yes, we urban bishops have challenges tending our flocks too.
But mom, I can be an urban shepard
The view is amazing, but we really got fleeced on the square footage.
...but the ad said Bo-peep would be included.
Hey boss, I won't be in today. I'm feeling a bit sheepish.
Hello, hello, you misheard me. I said flock.
Just letting you know I followed your advice and left them alone.
Well I wouldn’t exactly call it a harem, but there are signs of husbandry:
Mom's still adjusting to me living with her.
I know I've been a little sheepish about taking our relationship to the next level
Six large thin crust please,  pepperoni on one and grass on the others.
The boss is actually pretty lenient with herd from home Fridays.
If the landlord sees this, I’ll be in sheep dip.
And a special thank you to Lucky for finding this delightful AirBaaNBaa.
I'll call you right back-we're watching the Real Shepherds of NYC.
It doesn't matter what I do, I just can't get to sleep.
I was going to a costume party and they just started following me.
Bo Peep? Right, noon at 901 Fifth.
Watching the Rams, what’s new by ewe?
Well... I am with the board of directors right now, can  I call you back?
I'd like to cancel a missing sheep report
They’re calling us “sheeple” like it’s a bad thing.
Hello, Ms. Peep, I think I found them.
On second thought, is my old job in that little green booth at the bottom of the Lincoln Tunnel still available?
Mom, I sleep so good you wouldn't believe!
Yes, I can count them... 1, 2, 3, zzzzzzzzzzz
I've told you.  We can watch Babe as soon as the game is over.
I'd like to speak to a human.
I TOLD YOU ALREADY. AMBIAN DOESN'T WORK ON ME.
I considered the livestock auction...but Amazon was quicker...
Yes, honey, I know I promised not to bring my work home...but I'm doing it for us.
Sorry. I can't tell you. I'm on the lamb.
Working from home just seems different
this was a baaaaaaaad idea
I thought you said cheaper, not sheeper.
Hmmm, I guess an Uber is out of the question.
No, Ma'. My life is not like 'Sex and the City' now"
Detective Shepherd here.  I’ve got the crook but no one has had the wool pulled over their eyes.
It does make the place seem more cosy
Bo? Please pick up the phone -- I miss you.
Of course they are domesticated.
I find there's a surprisingly big market for sheep-walking services.
Can you herd them now? Good.
I think the GPS on my phone isn't working.
No no no - we're bleatin', not tweetin'.
They want to know..why is there an extra charge for the animal planet?
Perhaps I should stop counting sheep at night.
No, actually I'm still in his apartment. Cool guy.
Well, if you don't have shepherd's pie, I guess the meat loaf will do.
Someone on the phone wants to speak to ewe.
Apparently I was on the border collie's turf.
You pick up the tree--I'll flock it.
I'm fine, just watching TV with the kids
Hello, is this Ace Carpet Cleaning?
The first 9 sheep you count are free. After the tenth, then it's gonna cost ya.
Yes, I’d like a large pizza and 4 bales of hay delivered!
I don’t think it’s the TV that’s keeping me awake.
Hello? Yes, I'm the sleep specialist...
Yes, they are free range.
Well, hello. I was wondering if you still offer a pay-per-ewe bundle.
I'm having trouble getting the channel carrying the sheep dog trials.
Best sheepover party ever!
Now they worry about the Wolves of Wall St.
Being a shepherd was a wonderful dream, but getting them into the elevator to and from the sixty-third floor is a nightmare. And, don’t even get me started on the attitude of the people at the park where I graze them.
Throw rug or wall to wall?
This is unherd of!
She may have lost them, but I can't keep them anymore!
Has anyone reported finding a black sheep?
Room service? Yes, a large pizza and three bales of hay, please.
You sent them too early. I don't go to bed for four more hours!
Felica Warburg Rogan, Charlottesville,VA
House sitting. You?
It's not working, I still can't sleep.
Is this FarmersOnly.com?
With flex hours, I can work at home whenever I need to.
I try,but I can't seem to get away from my work.
How am I supposed to count them if my eyes are closed?
Sorry Doc, I still can’t get to sleep
I will not concede until there is a recount.
It doesn't matter how tired I get counting these darn things, their noise and smell is what's keeping me awake.
Counting them helped--but then their incessant 'Ba-a-ah-ing' wakes me up
Where's the dog?
I'd like some grass sent up to room 420. The legal kind.
Wait.  Don't literally count sheep?
I've got a baaaaaa-d connection.
No, mom, I'm not getting fleeced.
Nah man, Bo Peep pays $15 an hour and lets me order pay-per-view!
Hi, is Little Bo Peep in?
I'm planning one helluva leadership seminar.
Can you send in more sheep?  I already counted all of them and I still haven't fallen asleep.
You did  tell me to take everything I owned.
Don't worry, mom. Shepherding is a much better job than it used to be.
Room service, can you send up about 20 yards of sod?
Yes, you can - walking directions please to the nativity scene in Central Park.
At Trump Tower watching the news. Where are you?
Yeah, we moved to the city.
Any other ideas to help me sleep?
It's an air BaaaNB.
Yes, it's a great gig but the elavators are a problem.
Just calling to let you know I'm working from home today.
Please send up some more sheep, I still can't get to sleep
Of course, it's always about ewe...
Tell  Ms Peep I've cracked this case wide open!
She told me I've been pulling the wool over her eyes,
and I said, prove it.
They have no idea. They think we’re here to see Ed Sheeran.
No! I said I wanted a VIEW of the sheep meadow.
You' won't believe this--they actually came home!
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn’t sheep.
They were here all of the time  And not lost at all
Tell Amazon that we all feel strongly that there should be grazing land in Queens.
Get the flock out of here so we can talk.
Turns out they were right – you can't take the country out of the boy.
I ordered a fleece throw, not fleece as white as snow.
I'd like to book some salon appointments please.
Yes, this is 'Insomnia Anonymous.' We're booked solid for the next three months.
Yes please.  How do I turn off the 'go to sleep' hologram?
They're adjusting to city life.
If you love what you do you’ll never have to work a day in your life.
I'll have the breakfast special, 12 bushels of barley sprouts. and a shovel.
That's right, you heard me correctly: "I don't give a flock!
It's not working... And no, thanks, I don't need more to count.
We always come home for lunch and a little "Guiding Light."
My lost black sheep, 'is in the lobby bar, buying drinks for the house.' On my tab!"
No, I'm sure it's fine.  He said to just bring my work with me.
So I counted 12...now what?
Tell Little Bo Peep I think I have something of hers.
Other than having to pack 'em into the elevator it's about as convenient to the Sheep Meadow as you can get
Ya, I just sat down for a nap when you called.
Don't ask me - we just followed the GPS directions.
What am I up to? Same old sheep.
Two bales of hale, two bags of bedding, and one bottle of Merlot.
Bo, it's Mary I found them.
Missing Persons? I'd like to report a poor little lamb who's gone astray.
Can you send up 60 lbs. of hay, 12 lbs. of corn and some air freshener?
Doc, so how is this supposed to cure my insomnia?
Hello, I'd like to order one pepperoni pizza and one haystack.
I think I overherd
Well, it's not exactly a sit in, but they want it known that THEY'RE keeping ME and not the other way around.
Room Service, what channel is Shari Lewis?
I got weary of hearding cats.
Many, many followers, I would say
Yes, apartment 3B and knitting needles.
Not much, how about ewe?
Flock. F-L-O-C-K
After two weeks of insomnia, Alan was desperate.
Yo Peep! They're home and they brought their tails.
Well at least we have a great view of Central Park's Sheep Meadow.
and tell BoPeep that I've found them.
No, really, the grass is for my sheep...
I still can not sleep.  How can I get rid of the sheep.
Miss Peep? I think I've found somethings of yours
Honey, have you seen the remote?
I blame Ambien, Restoril, Halcion... no one just needs to count them anymore.
‘Your staff has been very helpful, but I had asked for a ‘cheap’ suite.”
This "farm to home" thing is working out pretty well
No, that rerun didn't help. I'm back to counting sheep.
I’ve always dreamed of moving to Manhattan...but now I’m thinking it might have been a mistake.
I blame my guidance counselor.
Bo?  They're over here.
Room service, I said I need sleep not sheep.
Yes. That’s FIFTY orders of organic wheat grass. Not the juice. The GRASS.
I know I said "I herd ewe," but what did you say?
We're all here, and I swore to them Hamilton will be well worth it!
Just kickin' back, and then counting on a good night's sleep.
Hi, Hon. We found an apartment that overlooks Sheep Meadow.
Sorry, I’m running late.  Had to bring some work home.
Management should have let me have a service dog.
What would make you think that I am trying to pull the wool over your eyes!
Lamb chops, leg of lamb, lamb shoulder-you name it, I got it all.  And if you order now I'll throw in a lambs wool scarf!
No Ms. Peep, they're not lost. However, they're demanding to stay until their take-out order arrives.
This sleep therapy isn't working.
Hello. Can you send up a large order of grass and clover?
Is it true you can buy grass real cheap in this city?
Room service? Could I please order several bowls of clover?
We're waiting for the delivery from the grazing menu
Ten large wee wee pads.
Little Bo-Peep, I think I found your sheep!
This is baaaaahd
These blasted sheep are keeping me awake.
No, they're not pets, and yes, I have my business license.
Do you have any melatonin?
I know what you told me to do, but I still have insomnia!
It's 2018, as if I'm the first tenant who has a 'comfort herd' provision in the lease.
My doctor prescribed Rambien.
I guess you could say I'm a sheep hoarder.
Oh, . . nothing.  What are you doing?
You say house-sitting, I say shepherding, let’s call the whole thing off.
Yes yes, I herd.
I couldn't just stop working, so I'm easing into retirement.
I'd like more than one wake up call in the morning.
I fixed my sleeping problem!
Hello, does your lawn need mowing?
Why do I keep letting myself get fleeced in telephone scams?
No, not busy. Just flock-sitting for a friend.
I didn't lose them.  FAKE NEWS!
Wel,l it's more like herding cats than I thought.
Little Bo-peep, I have your sheep,
You'll never believe where I found them;
But come alone, or they'll have a new home
And you'll never see their tails again.
I’m not feeling well, but I’ll be working from home.
They are in training to go to the White House.
We're cool.  I promised your doorman a lamb chop.
Ah yes, Ms. Bo Peep...I have good news...
Oh, yeah, cancel the lamb chops, and make that eleven salads!
Thanks for letting us use your place George; mind if we graze in your kitchen?
I did leave them alone. They came home. Yes, wagging their tails behind them.
Me? Spent the afternoon in Sheep Meadow...You?
I'm not so sure Bo ever really wanted us back...
True, I didn't want them in the meadow -- but I didn't totally think it through.
Not much. Just flocking around.
Any idea how I can stream Shari Lewis?
Thanks, but I still can’t get to sleep.
Twelve. Now what?
=“You heard me right, I’d like to order three gallons of mint jelly.”
...with extra pepperoni, and 12 side orders of grass.
That's right, I need a Ewe-ber right as soon as possible.
I can't count; so I'm watching TV to put me to sleep.
We're watching Shetland.
They are worried that when they are being counted at night, there will be a citizenship question.
Bo, we haven’t heard a peep from you in months.
But CNN just said these were already counted.
Little Bo-Peep, I found them watching Fake News.
Hey Bo-peep, the sheep made it home.
Mary, I thought you said you had only a few lambs!
No mom, I'm not in Kansas anymore.
I'm calling in response to a Missing Sheep flyer, is this Ms. Bo-Peep?
Mary Beth just couldn’t decide between the country life and the city life...
Just count’n sheep….how about you?
Yeah, bo peep... yeah...they found their way home.
They keep following me everywhere.
They help me get to sleep.
Mr. Bo-Peep? ...This is he.
I'm not lost.  It's the sheep that are lost.
Hi, yes. I'd like to order two hundred pounds of your medium quality hay and fifty pounds of grazing grass please.
I'm protecting them from Wolf Blitzer.
It’s really nice being able to walk everywhere.
Bo? Bo, you're not going to believe this, but . . .
Room service? Send up 50 pounds of grass
All her relatives came for the holidays
It's now spelled "B-e-a-u" Peep.
I'd like to order Shepard's Pie and some freshly harvested forage.
If you believe that, I've got a herd of sheep I can sell you.
Tell her I know where to find ‘em.
I’m feeling a bit sheepish
I do not CARE where MARY is'
Get here here now!
You said the room came with a mini-barn.
Nobody's putting me out to pasture.
We’re all here, but it was like herding cats getting them all registered at the front desk!
Who can sleep with all of these in here?
So, I counted them, but that didn't help either.
Yes, I'd  like your one room free carpet cleaning special.  Can you come this week?  And next week too?
Already picked them up from school
This sleep app is just not working!
What noise? Oh- just the TV.
Bo-Peep here, I have an even dozen ready to go.
They spell  W E A R  W O O L  across the field at halftime.
Usually I enjoy the assembly, but the Ikea sweater is too much for me
Tell Bo Peep she can find them in Apartment 5 E!
Not 'sheep' -- I said "sleep!' Trump's put a tariff on SLEEP!
Okay,Okay,it's almost halftime.  Then we'll go for a walk.
Long story, couldn't fall asleep last night, started counting........
Hello, I'm having issues with my Lamb Router.
Could you give me the directions to Bethlehem?
Thanks for your concern, but I don't have a sheep hoarding problem.
But.... I love them
Hello, Shepard’s Pie Escort Service...?  You can pick up now.
Hi Room Service, can I get 50lbs of grass clippings delivered to  902.
So I dumped my Tech and now I'm into Ag.
Speak up.. Im only getting three bahs!
Hi. Yeah, I’d like to place an order for seventy-seven grass pizzas.
The herds all here.
Is that wolf still prowling around down there?
Hello, Miss Peep. Did I wake you?
No joke. Airbn-baaas are a thing.
So far, the only problem is the smell.
On second thought, make 'em all veggie...
Uh, yeah, Bo Peep, that’s the good news; the bad news is that in three days they’ve run up a $5,000 bill at the Four Seasons NY Downtown.
We had to take emergency refuge from the wolf of Wall Street
They're strict vegans so our choice of restaurants is always somewhat limited.
I assure our products are 100% farm-to-sweater.
Hello--would you mind asking Ms. Peep if there is a finder's fee for her sheep?
Two large with clover and two large with grass
Count yourselves and go to sleep and stop with the kvetching already.
A 4th-floor walkup but we're near the park so ...
What I've learned is that Bo don't know sheep.
I am the black sheep of the family.
Hello, Gristedes? Please deliver a pound of whitefish, , a dozen onion bagels, a chocolate rugala, and six bales of hay.
Sorry I missed your call.  Please leave a message after the Bo Peep.
No, the pigeons have not come home to roost.
Joe Peep, not Bo Peep.
Well, at least they're not lost anymore.
Seriously, when do I get a break ?
Remember how I was telling you that I wanted to be an urban shepherd?
Sorry I missed your call. I fell asleep counting them again.
We’re taking a me day.
Thanks, Dear...But I think you may have misunderstood me when I said, 'What our world needs are more yous!'
They're quiet.  Too quiet.
Hello, you've reached Bo-Peep.com.  We're rather busy right now."
Yes, I was calling about the delivery status of my "Sheep herding is Fun" instructional video
Let Bo-Peep know I found them
I went to every farm-to-table in the city.  There’ll be no mutton on the menus tonight!
And no cops Bo Peep.
They say they won’t leave without Mary.
Yes, I've been counting but I'm still not sleepy
Tell Bo to chill.
No, Mary's not here. You have the wrong number.
I  need you to send me a sheepdog. Things are looking ugly.
Right number, I'll solve your insomnia for good!
They surrounded me and demanded that I put on "Silence of the Lambs."
Hello.  Manhattan Feed and Grain?  Do you deliver?
So what else could I do with a shepherd's staff?
Good Morning Pastor John, I thought the Lord was MY Shepard.
I'm sorry, but it's 'finders-keepers', Ms. Peep
Honey, I think this adoption thing took a ewe-turn.
I'm suspicious that one of them tampered with the GPS.
No no, you were right. Herding in the city is nothing like herding back home.
Extra pepperoni, no black olives, double order of clover.
If you’re renting an office in New York, you’re getting fleeced.
Well, the weather looks iffy, and the flock has a pretty strong union.
Room service?   I'm going to need a lot of mint jelly.
My clients want to know why they're aren't getting "Animal Planet."
Hello, Miss Peep. I've found your sheep.
Your fantasy was Dr. Shepherd from Grey's Anatomy? I've made a terrible mistake.
We decided to check the farm report before heading out.
Can you repeat the order to me? 12 wheatgrass and 1 burger.
Bo-Peep, Bill calling. I found your sheep."
The cable's good but the mini bar's not going to last.
I can never count on these guys...
I've just been sitting here binging on Lassie reruns.
It was just a short nap.
Well, sure I miss her, but at least I never have trouble falling asleep.
I was warned I’d be fleeced when I bought this place, but I had no idea.
Yes, I want to get rid of my followers.
No, I’m telecommuting today.
We made it home in time for the night time count, but you wouldn't BELIEVE the traffic we hit in the midtown tunnel!
Hi , Mary.  I need your help.
My room is flocked!
Hey Bo Peep, Guess what I found!
When can you pick them up Miss Peep?
The usual, the chicken lo mein and a dozen sod rolls.
No Fox tonight.
Grubhub?  Five bales of hay, please.
The floor is a mess, but they’re easier to keep track of.
How exactly was this supposed to help me sleep?
On second thought, cancel the rack of lamb.
It's not the size of the crook, it's how you use it.
You have no rules on pets? Okay!
Like a good neighbour Sheep Farm is here...
My sleep therapist suggested that I bring them.
Their union contract specifies they don't sleep in the manger.
Bo - get on over here. They don't know where to find you.
I'd like to order five large meadow special pizzas with extra clover please.
Mary, I’m sure you said ONE little lamb.
The L.A. Rams are the favorites in this house.
Never should have given Little Bo Peep the day off!
Just wool-gathering as usual
Of course Miss Peep, I'll make sure they stay off the sofa.
Sorry, I'll turn the TV down.
Now that you mention it, I guess I haven't been sleeping great.
Yeah, well...there was no room at the stable.
750 channels but nothing on sheep.
It's my new startup-- "Shear Delight."
I will count you guys at bed time...
I'm thinking of making the transition to cats.
Happy holidays--we're just waiting on Joseph and Mary.
Before you head over, stop and get some shears.
Please don’t tell me it’s a bull market.
Hello, room service? Can I get one order of Eggs Benedict and twelve orders of hay?
Is Little Bo Peep there?
The repercussions of Mary’s retirement.
Can I get an Uber for 12 sheep at 6 O'clock  at 57th and Fifth?
"Where in hell is Little Bo Peep?
One pepperoni and 12 grass please.
Your name is Beau Peep!?!  
Listen, is your sister home?
Tech support? I've counted them over and over again. Still wide awake.
May I speak to Bo Peep,please?
Stop staring! The only crook in the room is the one I'm holding!
Bah, bah, bah...so what’s new
I thought it would make it easier to count them.
Working from home comes with it’s own challenges.
Yes, I found my sheep.
Twelve vegan platters and one lamb burger.
I tried counting them--there are twelve--but I still can't get to sleep.
I don't think this was such a good idea, Mom.  They've already cleaned out the mini-fridge and now they want me to call room service.
Gonna Netflix 'n' Chill with the flock...you?
Wolf, shmolf.
The new place is great but they have a no dogs policy
I'm not sleepy.
I tried a home remedy last night.  Didn't sleep a wink.
No, of course I'm not at the Hyatt. You know my circumstances require I stay in an AirBnB... I'm not an asshole, Karen. Of course I'm only bringing one to the wedding.
Netflix, big hook, endless wool...let the binge crocheting begin!
You've picked a baaaaaad time to call."
Getting them up here was easy. Keeping them off the furniture is the hard part
Please send twelve bales of hay, one incredibly well-rested goat and my apologies to housekeeping.”
I asked for a room with A ewe” [“a” should be underlined
Not exactly alligators, but I’m still pretty busy.
I’d like 10 orders of clover, eight of kudzu, five sides of knapweed, and 12 grass shakes.
Can't this afternoon.  We have a four o'clock in Central Park.
Yeah, the genie was hard of hearing. He must have thought I said I want to wake up in a city that ever sheeps.
Your apartment is fine. That noise? Oh I’m watching the farming channel.
I'm taking up knitting. Is that a problem?
yes, yes, yes,. I took them to the farm and tomorrow I'm taking them to the zoo!
I'd like one small General Tso's chicken and fourteen quarts of rice
Right before I doze off, I'll be taking a head count
No, Honey, there's no one I love more than ewe...
Tell Bo Peep I took them for a ride into the City!
Ms. Peep. I'll have to raise my sheep-sitting rates. They've eaten my shag carpet and are starting in on my sofa.
Having herded the sheep by promising them outsized returns, Bob called the wolves back to Wall Street to cause the next credit crisis
I just moved into the Woolworth Building.
Hello, Front Desk?  I said , 'I needed to get some sleep!'
Ms. Bo-Peep?  I have your sheep at the Ritz.
Oh yeah, just livin' the dream."
No, no problems at all -- they've all been as good as little lambs!
Awake all night, so they didn't work.
Seriously, I still can't go to sleep.
Send Babe!
telecommutton
No, she wasn't lost; she was stolen.
Sorry, Bo. No, I haven't seen them at all.
There's a callback on Monday. I just need to work on the accent.
No, they're not here.
Yeah, but I don't get Netflix out in the meadow.
Yes Susan, you can help me. I'm just not sure this Airbnb is the 'oasis in nature' it was advertised as.
The apartment says "Pet Friendly," and for how many?
I know, but we did vote for him
Yeah and it looks like Mary also has a sweet little view of the Hudson.
Of course it's your fantasy, but I could only afford the sheep for an hour.
There's fourteen. And I'm still awake.
Mom, I'm back from Europe.
Wool on Wall Street! 
“Hey Jamie! I got the physical delivery of the stock for the derivatives you purchased on my account last month”

We were wondering, where's the remote?
Please leave your message after the Bo-peep...
Hello, may I speak with Miss Bo Peep?
That's right-- party of 13 for the Garment District.

Yes, just got back from New Zealand...
Hello, City Sheep, LLC.  Our sheep are warm, cuddly companions.  You will be nodding off in no time.  How can I help you?
I found them, BoPeep.
My border collie quit yesterday. I'm waiting for Amazon Prime to deliver a new one today.
Yes, they think they are a bit underrepresented on the animal channel
Not to worry, Bo, they're here with me.
Look, my name isn't Mary OR Bo Peep, you've got the wrong number.
14 pizzas for delivery,please.  Half alfalfa,half organic clover.  CanI tip the delivery person in artistic lanolin?
Well, tell Bo Peep to call me.
I dunno, but the Border Collie was pulling his own little joke!
This is Little Bo Peep. I found them.
Hey, Bo Peep. Yeah, you left them here.
...but first, we climbed every mountain.
No Beau, I haven't heard a peep out of them since they got here
Hello, room service? I’m having a hard time keeping my sheep under control. Could you send up a border collie please?

When Siri misunderstands heard for herd
A much better gig than dog walking.
Scissors and a loom  -  yes, that's right.  How much?
...and 50,000 ounces of actual grass.
Their was no Air BNB with a pasture.
Could you send up some grass?- No I mean REAL GRASS- not hemp!
Now can I get some sleeping pills?
Don't give me that crap about "The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want"-!
...and 20 side orders of clover.
Me and the boys are just hanging out, binge-watching the "Good Shepherd"
. . . and a plate of fries.  Plus, can you send up six bales of hay?
There's a wolf in the meadow. I'm monitoring via live cam.
Does that come in silk or cotton;  anything but wool?
I told him there weren't any black sheep but he still didn't let me cross the border.
I'm so sorry Miss Bo-Peep - they just blindly followed me like a flock of ... well... sheep.  No no ... my name is Crump not Trump.

Can you believe they picked "America's Got Talent" over
"Animal Planet"
Hello, this is the Empire State building's personal shepherd. Yes, I can walk your animal from 10 - 2 for $45 per hour. We're currently on a lunch break in my apartment.
How am I feeling? Sheepish!
I am trying to do my part to bridge the urban-rural divide.
It's much easier being a city herder, but the sheep are still having trouble adjusting.
Give me about an hour, Mark. I have some sheep to count.
They're following me around like sheep.
James, how many times do I need to ask you not to leave your cane in my apartment?
Hello Doctor Jones...counting sheep hasn’t helped.
Hello, Ms. Peep, I have your sheep. 
And it'll cost you $50k if you want them back.
I cant tonight. I’m house sitting for Little Bo Peep.
I'd rather not meet at my place, I'm a little sheepish.
I know  the sheep belong in the meadow, but this is Manhattan!
But your ad said that pets are ok.
Could you ship a case of Woolite up here, ASAP, please ?
Hello. Fred’s urban sustainable farm.  May I help you?
No, Ms. Muffet is not here. She was elected to Congress.
This is BoPeep. You'll never guess where I found them.
And they said I'd never make it in the big city.
I'm telling you, this Trump guy is crazy
OK, so I blindfolded them and led them into this Trump Tower room, and you want me to do WHAT?
Doctor Lecter, I haven’t slept for so long even the sheep are tired of jumping.
What can I tell you? The meek shall inherit penthouses too.
Oh, mutton much. Ewe?
Sure, the stock seems to be growing, but at the end of the
day it's all over the place.
We're waiting for a callback for a Serta commercial.
Paul Lorde is your shepherd, you shall not want for a better sheep sitting professional. How can I help you today?
12 is good. 13 would just be ridiculous.
Nothing, just watching TV. I can't fall asleep.
Ms. Bo Peep?  Yeah, yeah.  I got 'em.
It’s like herding sheep.
Can I call you back? 'The Good Shepherd' just came on.
We're at the Meadowlands Plaza, 20th floor, room 3D
Well...I got "Babe" on demand and they don't care.
Just watching Sean Hannity, you?
Im supposed to meet Little Bo Peep here for the night!
Delivery?
Ok, a dozen large salads, no dressing. And a bottle of red, and some nachos. Been a day, you know?
Mom, I’ve been counting for hours and I’m not even drowsy.
You see Joe -I am kinda on the lamb
But it was you who said you wanted to meet everyone involved in making your beautiful coat.
I Herd.
I dunno, Mary -- home schooling ain't all it's cracked up to be.
I promised them we would watch something that is wild and woolly.
Blah, blah, blah, baa, baa, baa!
Hey Siri, where's in Central Park is the sheep meadow?
I finally found a great stay-at-home job.
We're doing great! How're ewe?
Sure it's a little dull, but at least they allow remote working.
Little bo peep I’ve found you’re sheep.
Little Po-Peep Come get your sheep!
Bo? They knew where to find me.
I don't want to call the Meat Wholesaler either, hon, but times are tough and rent is due this week.
Sure, I'm trying to sleep, but I've lost count!
I did tell them the party started at 7:30, yes.
Is this Bo Peep?
.


You didn’t hear right I never said cheap.
Operator,
Would you have a number for a Little Bo Peep?
The real estate agent pulled the wool over our eyes.
Hey, Little Bo, wassup?
I’ve seriously got to start thinking of getting the flock out of here.
It's a lot more responsibility, plus I have to take my work home with me.
They’re OK, but there was less housework when the dogs did the herding.
Yeah hello, tell Miss Bo Peep I found them.
I'm telling you, the sheep know. They've known all along.
Hey, Bo Peep, I know where you can find them.
Well, Cousin Bo, you should have thought about that before you danced with my Larry.
I don't think the sleep timer function on my new TV is working correctly.
I’d like to speak with Mary please
I'm just watching The Farm Show and I've got to say this new TV does bring the picture to life.
Okay guys zip it. Green Acres is about to start!
Hello, Mary?  I've got a whole lot of sheep here. . .
Mary's out having a mani-pedi with the girls. I'm home watching the kids.
Bo Peep? I found your phone...yes, it's fine. Don't you want your sheep back too?
Forget farming, urban sheep herding is the next big thing.
No, Bo Peep. I didn’t kidnap them.  They just wanted a nicer view of the Park than you could provide.
Today, we went to the Sheep Meadow in Central Park. Tomorrow, we're going to the Bronx Zoo.
Count me out.
Listen, you are not the first to try to pull the wool over my eyes.
Wolf? Yeah, I really need you this time around.
Yeah, what sort of grass do you have on the menu tonight?
Maybe counting them worked, and I'm really asleep.
It's not for you; it's for the ewe.
Look Bo-Peep, it's not my fault they like my apartment better than yours.
I am the good shepherd and I know they want the premium package.
I was about to start herding, but then I started binging 'This is Us."
We were thrown out of Sheeps Meadow again.
A cheeseburger with fries, a chocolate milkshake and 4 bushels of clover.
Not baaaad.  You?
Yeah, this is what you get when there's a leadership vacuum.
I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
Well,they told to bring farm to the table.
Hello? Daa-aad?
We've been outsourced.
I can't seem to find Waldo.
Yes, I have rebooted the modem and no, my sheep have not chewed through the cable.
No, Monseigneur. 
I said that I am a good shepherd  not THE Good Shepherd.
I'm going to count sheep until the cows come home.
I got ninety-nine problems, but lack of sheep ain't one.
I'll take anything but the lamb.
and to ewe & ewe & ewe
Yes, yes, more sheep than you can count. I’ll be there at 11 pm.
So you say Ms. Bo Peep has lost her sheep?
Yes, dear, you shall not want.
I already told Bo-Peep, I'll return the sheep when she gives me her Netflix password.
How fast can you deliver a few pounds of grass?
Yeah, they all made it home...now could you come get them!
It's great, except for the wool comforters.
This is not what I expected when you said everything was made of 100% pure wool.
Bo? can you come over? It’s Boy Blue.
Yeah, I got a great deal on a sublet in Sheepshead.  Family discount.
Ten orders of grass, please, for room service.
Can I get same day delivery on that electric fence?
What do you mean I'm the black sheep of the family?
There will be some clean up involved, but I couldn't miss my show.
Well now I'm Big Mo Peep!
Little Bo Peep?
I’ve got another flock calling, can you hold?
I just wish I could train them to stay off the couch.
Woolwoorth please...
It’s much better than the herding cats gig!
I like to think of myself more as a watcher.
I finally fell asleep, woke up this morning, and . . .
Please blow your horn louder.
Does the hotel have a Lost and Found?
What happened to diversity?
What do you mean I wasn’t supposed to count LITERAL sheep?!
I've lost my field and can't tell where to find it.
Ewe wouldn't believe...
​"It is a nice gift but I'm a park ranger not a shepherd."
Sixteen, and this administration is still keeping me up.
I don't care what color the sky is, the Weather Channel is telling us to stay put
Wolf!
Seriously...are you trying to fleece me?
I can't help it.  Their contract calls for a mid-morning break.
How many legs do you need?
I am just a random, anonymous fellow checking all animal shelters to see if anyone has brought in a stray sheep.
Hey Bo. I think I found all of your sheep.
Just send up an Ambien already.
I’m looking for a housebroken sheepdog.
They want me to turn to the 'Farm Report'.
I said a few could stay, you must’ve herd differently
Yeh, YouTube has a How-to DIY video on urban herding.
I wanted them to see what city life is like.
What field am I in? Mostly grassy meadows.
Can I have Little Bo Peep's # please?
I mean, it’s, like, how they fell asleep in the olden days...yeah, all ethically sourced man.
Tell Mary she forgot her lambs
Hello, Mary! Please come back ASAP!
I know that stuff is illegal, and why would I order 10 pounds of grass from room service in the first place?
Yeah and I get to work remotely from home a couple days a week.
It's a sublet.
Nice prank Mark
MARY! You said you had only ONE little lamb!
Oh, nothing much. Just doing some pre-knitting.
Hi. Is this tech support for Ali-Baaaa-Baaaa?
Bo Peep, they came home by themselves wagging their tails behind them.
Wolf?  This is Shep.  Say, does midnight tomorrow look good for you?
I didn't know I was part of the insomnia study
Bo Peep?  I think I found something of yours.
Room Service? Send up 12 massaged kale salads, 3 orders of avocado toast and a shepherd’s pie.
Season's bleatings, friend!
I won't count you now. I'll count you at bedtime.
Do they prefer Morning Joe or Fox & Friends
Hello housekeeping-Thanks for the offer, but we don't need any extra wool blankets!
Hello?  Is Bo-Peep there?
Sorry, I can't go. I'm just feeling too sheepish today.
There's a lot of fleecing with this job, Dad. So, no, law school wasn't a total waste of money.
Send up a bottle of Mouton Cadet and 16 glasses.
I'm at a friends house....You don't know her....Bo Peep....
They're calling me the Wolf of Wool Street.
I'll have the lamb chops, preferably on a covered plate.
Listen, sweetie, your sheep came home.
You want to talk to Ewe?!  Ewe who?
Ma'am, I called for Shepherd's pie. I didn't sign up for this.
They like the layout but request some updates in the kitchen.
Hi, IT? I’m working from home today, and I’m having trouble accessing the pasture remotely.
Bo-Peep is still in town so they are too hot to fence.
Martha, when will you be here for our sheepover?
I'm keeping it together here.
Place a ten thousand dollar bet on the rams, now.
Are you sure this is where the knitting group is meeting?
I like working from home, but I think it inconveniences my coworkers.
Just hanging out at the apartment binge watching "Breaking Baaahhhhhhdddd."
No, sweetheart, it’s not that I’m bringing work home again: it’s just coming in by itself
Leave us alone, and we might come home — or not.
Where the hell is Heidi.
Yes, we specialize in rooftop gardens.
Yeah it was cheap. Who knew what came with Sam Shepherd's former apartment?
The sheep are not buying the landscape on TV
They were awake all night in the Sheep Meadow, so we’re here at the Hilton.
I am binge shepherding.
I feel tired all the time now.
I feel sheepish, but...
I prefer talk to text...call me old fashioned.
This is flocked up!
Yes and a large serving of shepherd’s pie.
Hello, Google Maps?
Getting them all on the elevator was the tricky part
I could change your pillow stuffing while I'm at it." -- Seren Meketa, Berkeley CA (age 9
Can’t talk mom, my friends from high school are here
Oh...imaginary sheep.
The Lord is my shepherd, but my landlord's a pain.
Well now I don't have to imagine them to count
Is this Little Bo Peep? I found them!
We're just out gamboling.
Can you believe it - to help you get to sleep you get to count your own sheep!
Sorry Mate, can't head into work this morning... feeling a bit sheepish
Is this room service?  Could you please send someone up to count these sheep for me?  I'm trying to get to sleep.
Living in the city, you ever worry about falling into the herd mentality?
Its just my take on the whole Urban Farming thin
You won't believe this, but we spotted Cybil Shepherd AND Harry Shearer.
Crazy, no!. Sheer madness, maybe.
I was counting sheep when you called, now I'll have to start over.
Yeah, it's me.  Is that ewe?
Ms. Peep?
I've tried leaving them alone but they're not going home. Tell Bo-Peep to get her tail over here.
Hello 911...? I had trouble sleeping and now....
I found a great place on airbaa-n-baa.
Mutton. Ewe?
Tell her they've been found on the seventh floor of the Acme Building.
No Mom, I told you, I've given up shepherding. I'm a better man now.
"And now, for our viewers at home: ewe get a car! Ewe get a car! Ewe get a car!"
I'm gonna wrap it up here in a second, I'm getting tired.
Ewes all be quite, the Rams are about to take the field
Gah, you know I'd love to go out, but I had to bring work home with me.
The party was going pretty well until we ran out of grass.
Well, I guess the only downside is syphilis.
Hello, Mary?  You won't believe...
Me? I've just been sitting here and woolgathering all afternoon.
Sorry, but I'm busy at the moment. I have a few colleagues over from work.
Mary you were right.  I took a nap, and they all came back.
They watch what I watch.
Now look here, I demand to speak to the Manager.  I was unaware of this hotel’s ‘No Dog’ policy until my arrival...and it really is quite inconvenient for me”
I was just trying to sleep.
Count sheep" you said..
I shouldn't have had that after dinner coffee
I'll admit it...there are easier ways to get a country feeling at home.
Not for nothin', but it was your weekend with these guys.
Where is the black sheep?
Hang on  --  the kids want to say "Hi" to ewe.
Looks like the flock market is dropping - let's sell.
So far I'd have to say this "Wolf of Wall Street" character is overrated.
Blackie's on Fox - they won't watch.
When we go to the bar, they always get carded.
We’re going to be in the living Nativity show here at Trump Tower.
Just enough to cure my insomnia!"
Yes, one dozen garden salads and I am expecting Little Bo Peep."
The downstairs neighbors really know how to pen a passive-aggressive note.
I'm going to work from home today.
One pie and 30 pounds of silage.
Hello, Costume City? I said leopard! Not shepherd!
the cable company is fleecing me
I’ve herded up the whole gang. We’re watching Dances With Wolves.
Mom, it's time to change the batteries!  I said to tell my staff that I need 12 hours of SLEEP!
I'd like a large, thin crust shepherd's pie.
Can't we just stay in and binge-watch something for once?
I need three bales of very fresh clover.  You deliver, right?
It's Little Bo Peep. I've lost my lease.
Here in the garment district, I thought things might go from baa to worsted."
I'm at a party for people who think New Yorker cartoons are still funny, what are you up to?"
No, No, they want to come home.  It's me who wants to stay
Feed the dogs for me, I’m working from home today.
Hey Bo, I found your sheep
It sure beats walking dogs for a living.
Just tell Bo Peep everything is under control.
These edibles you gave me ain't shi — oh, wait, hold on, hold on, whoa. I take it back, dude.
They help me sleep.
The ad said “condo sitter, bring a crook.”
I am NOT crying wolf.
Yes, ma'am, it did say 'no pets,' but it said nothing about not having any livestock in the apartment.
They follow me everywhere.
Counting them makes me sleepy.
That's right. The apartment has two bedrooms, one bath and a pen.
How many? Hmm......let me see.
I’m working under cover to catch the Wolf of Wallstreet
My Dear Miss Bo Peep… I have found your lost sheep… They run and they leap over fences quite high… Over hedges, they fly… Tho, for me, slow to slumber, takes a much greater number of sheep after sheep jumping free and, my God, over gate and façade…
Tell  L’il Bo Peep her sheep have come home.
They needed a vacation from the dogs.
What's the line on the Rams?
I was up all night. Please have the farmacy increase my dosage.
Oh, nothing much, just some binge-sheeping.  You?
Yes sir, all the sleeping aids spilled out of the bottle.
Hello, Mr. Peep? Could you let Bo know that this working from home thing is not all it is cracked up to be.
She got the decorating idea from Bed Baaath and Beyond.
Seriously,it’s like herding sheep around here! Can’t get a thing done.
I told  Farmer Jimmy that ewe all should come over.
Hello, I'm trying to reach a Miss Little Bo Peep...
We usually take the A to 59th and walk up to Sheep Meadow on Sundays.
Sure.  I can bring a pie.
I hope the super didnt spot us in the elevator
What do you mean I sound sheepish?
Amazon? Mary here. 
There seems to be an issue with my recent lamb order. 
Yes, I realize there was a "cheaper by the dozen" special...
Of COURSE I left them alone!! Now what?
Just Waiting for the arrival of the black sheep.
Yes, that's correct. apartment U.
I can’t count ‘em again, I need my sleep!
Well, counting them just wasn't working for me.
I know, I know, but I'm not a herder!
I told you to wait until  I’m ready to fall asleep!
Layoffs are tough in this economy.
The 'Air Baa n B' looks nothing like the pictures online
Maybe this wasn’t quite what I was looking for when I left Wall Street.
kids, watch, this is what pasture used to look like
Hello, is this Bo Peep? Have you misplaced some sheep lately?
My boyfriend hates it when I work from home.
They won’t go to sheep.
No -  the crook is just fine, but I misread the free sheepping part
How am I going to explain this to our Airbnb host?!
Yes, babe, I got use a themed room just like you wanted.
Donald Trumps and his followers.
No, Gwen, they don't allow dogs.
I called the Yale Club and said we're poor little lambs who have lost our way.
Do you have wheat grass?
Mom - I am not giving up my rent-controlled apartment
I told my doctor, sleeping pills give me hallucinations.
Yes Little, not just your crook was left here!
When she said her name was BaaBaaAnne, I naturally thought her parents were Beach Boys fans...
No. I haven't heard that the lambs are missing.
Before airbnb, I couldn’t afford to bring the whole flock.
Bo Peep?? Yeah, They’re here watching Fox News again.”
They heard me say, “Staff meeting!”
I need some city dogs that trust their natural herding instincts.
Well, they're home. But they're not wagging their tails behind them.
Little Bo-Peep quit.  I'm in charge now.
Hi Mary - I know we just started dating, but you gave me the impression that I was babysitting one lamb...
I said, 'stock', you fool. Why would I ask my broker for a flock?
Little Bo Beep Detective Service....
They don't disappear if they can't make you sleep.
I've counted them but still can't get to sleep.
Hello? Dolly?
I know you mean well,  Doctor, but I'm getting tired of these allergy tests.
Well this is frustrating.  I paid the pet deposit.
'Who's this? No, I'm not Sam Shepherd.'
Room service?  Could you make that a ten pound house salad, light on the croutons?
It's just that, I moved to this city thinking there would be more work...
It seems in addition to a good Samaritan law there's also a good shepherd one as well."
Trust me,the grass will eventually be greener on this side of the fence.
Doc, I didn’t think you prescribing a cane would come with any side effects.
Sure Bo, they're all here with me.  Why?
You can stop complaining about not being able to sleep. I finally found them.
Hello, Bo Peep?...well, I found them. Now they’re hooked on “Animal Planet”, and won’t leave!
Waiting for the trade war to end, and you
No, the carbon dioxide emissions are the least of my worries.
Guess I can’t count on you anymore.
And just where does one apply for a shepherd's license in this town?
This is David conferencing in. I'm working from home today.
Not to worry, Bo Peep. They're with me.
Hi, you've called 1300-Ewe've-got-a -problem, how can we help?
Yeah Bo? You won't believe what I found.
Bad news all around. The roof-top pasture is closed.
Hello, Bo Peep? Good news, I found them!
Hi Bo Peep, guess who showed up at my apartment!
My therapist recommended counting sheep to help me fall asleep, but it doesn't seem to be working...
I’m staying in this evening, I brought work home and thought I’d just order a pizza.
Sorry, you got me at my home office.
It is nice to visit the city once in a while to take a break.
Hi operator, I'm looking for a Miss Little Bo-Peep.
I've brought them down from the penthouse for the winter.
Netflix an' chillin'. You?
C'mon over, Bo, the Rams game is on!
Mary:  "Can you hear me now?  I hear ewes..."
Evidently,no one has heard of service sheep flocks.
A sheep meadow off west 67th?  Who knew?
Yes, "within walking distance to Sheep Meadow" is a must.
Yeah, hi Amazon, my grass hasn't been delivered yet.
Not B-ah-ah-ah-ad.  You?
Everybody gets wool socks this Christmas.
I'm afraid you can only have one support animal on the flight to Jerusalem.
They're here. Now what?
I got it on Air Baa-n-Baa
Yeah, they kicked us out of the park again.
The flock agrees--this hotel has great creature comforts.
I did. I did try counting sheep. No. It didn't work. Thank you though.
Wanna have a sheepover?
They keep the panhandlers away.
And how much for each additional cot?
They were buy 1, herd 2 free. I couldn’t resist.
The free WiFi is great, but the work-life balance has got a bit blurred
Ewe all need to leave now.
Lately when the news comes on, it doesn't matter how many sheep there are, I still can't seem to fall asleep.
As it turns out, it is better to have a yard with some grass.
Where are ewe?
I'm not so sure about this telecommuting thing.
They only allow one pet per room.  I registered them as one flock.
No, honey...I'm sick to death of YEWS, not youse!
I was up all night counting sheep again.
Little Bo Peep I have found your sheep.
I don’t know doc, I’m feeling... sheepish
They are okay but it just got too cold out there.
Under this arrangement, the good news is I don't need  a sheep dog.
All they'll eat now is Japanese fusion.
I’m going to have to go back to Craig’s List, my Airbnb rating is really low.
Can I get a small pepperoni, mushroom and cheese and a bushel basket of grass clippings with a side of dandelions?
Hey Bo? I think you forgot your Peeps this morning!
Wine and cheese? Five-ish? Sheep Meadow? I'm in.
You’re right, a wool rug matches the drapes perfectly.
Bopeep?....
Yeah, I found your sheep.”
The city's nice but my day hasn't changed much.
Seriously, I don't give a flock.
Hello, yes, I'll have twelve of the Irish Forb, seven Scottish Clover, two Dutch Grass, please, and a pie.
I don't get it,  Marv: I was just browsing the ads for the nearby Christmas tree lots, hit the tab for "get flocked now" and then all of a sudden the room was full of them!
I feel a little sheepish about eating lamb.
Who me?  You know, same old flocking thing.
...that's right, pepperoni and mushrooms.  Also, do you have sod?
I think they're pulling their wool over my eyes!
But doc, how can I sleep when they never make it over the fence?
That's right, a dozen red truckers caps and a bale of hay.
Yeah, city shepherding is a lot easier.
Other than "walking the sheep" three times a day, it's working out fine.
Just calling to talk about those I owe ewes.
When I called down to room service I didn’t realize that the word ‘sheep’ could mean either singular or plural.
Shepherding vertically is easier than I thought it would be.
I'm not so sure about this urban shepherd bit.  I'd really rather if he would "maketh me lie down in green pastures and leadeth me beside still waters."
The grass is tough but otherwise this place is great.
Yeah, but did you know dogs aren't allowed in the elevators?
It happens more often than you'd think.
You said “Take a left at bend in the creek?” What I heard was, “Take the elevator up to the penthouse suite.”
We just got to the Airbnb.”
None of them brought dip.
Where's little boy blue?  Tell him to blow his horn..These sheep are getting too comfortable.

We’re having mutton
Sheep temps, how can I help you?
It’s just different when the wolves are sent by corporate.
I'll call ya back; I'm watching 'Silence of the Lambs' in VR.
But where is the boy who looks after the sheep?
He's here in your living room, watching VEEP.
These new age pillows are annoying.
"I'm sleeping fine dear, but you sure I needed to bring live ones?"
Yes, she's black and covered with wool.
I never have a problem getting to sleep.
I don't mind the job, but this apartment's too small.
If that kid cries wolf again, he's covering the hotel.
Thanks! I was having a hard time getting to sleep.
What ? I counted you guys last night!
Hello Bo Peep?  Problem solved.
Thou hast reached Jedediah on his working vacation.
Hmm. I feel like Tippi Hedren in the phone booth.
Yah, this Airbnb does have a good view.
Peep, I got something of yours here.
Yeah, we all got checked in fine, but there's only basic cable TV. I think they're bored, and this could turn ugly.
I specifically asked for a hill facing room.
Every seven days I rest. Doesn't make me a bad shepherd.

They refuse to leave the apartment until I kill the Wall Street wolf.
How was I supposed to know they'd follow me home?
Bo? Yeah, they’re here! I told them I can get a group discount to ‘The Lion King’ but they didn’t seem interested.
I only asked for an extra blanket
The sharing economy does make the job easier.
Yeah. The situation stinks. And I’m losing sleep about it.
It’s for ewe...and ewe...and ewe and ewe and ewe.
The pasture was full, but we got an AirBaa-n'-Baa on the Lower Lea Side.
I didn't know that GPS stood for "Get Plenty of  Sheep"
Talk to you later, I gotta get the flock out of here.
Yes, I’m holding for a BoPeep
WORKING, AND YOU?
Room service, has New York legalized grass?
Mom, we love living in the city.
No, I’m into unpasteurized sheep milk now.
They've got to think outside the meadow
...and after all I've done, I still can't go to sleep.
Yes, they know how to use the elevator!
OK, I've got my side hustle on.  Now what?
Please tell Ms. Bopeep I have found her sheep.
Hello, I'm calling for a ewe-ber.
I don't know how many, but they keep me awake at night.
Yes, an elevator building that allows pets — 
a fourth-floor walkup loses its charm after a while.
It's only a movie and Anthony Hopkins doesn't even touch any lambs."
No pets are allowed, but I pulled the wool over their eyes.
Yeah, they're home, wagging their fucking tails.  I told you not to leave them alone!
It was cold.

the sheep are not happy
Hello. Little BoPeep? Uh...just wondering if you lost something.
Nothing on TV interests them.
I thought they'd be stuffed!
Hey so small problem....I can’t connect to the WiFi.
The biggest challenge so far has been what to order in for dinner.
They want to know if the Whiffenpoof Song is in the key of B flat.
I have a date with Little Bo Peep.
You said if I order now I can get free sheeping and handling.
All I said was baa humbug.
Found the sheep. Lost the Wifi connection.
You all belong down the hall at the sleep clinic.
I'm waiting 'till the cows come home.
Yeah Hi. Room 417. Can I get 12 milking buckets? Okay great, the sooner the better. And I can't find "Babe" on the the Netflix channel.
Wait! So if I hit Input 3, they'll start jumping? And then do I count backwards or forwards to get to sleep?
Yeah, I'm watching the informational film now. You know what? I think I'm doing it all wrong".
Still not sleepy.  Any other suggestions?
And do each of those come with side salads?
Do you really expect me to leave these 99 here to go get the lost one?
Yeah, my neighbors have a problem with the gig economy.
Well, we like Manhattan& love Central Park.
Bo Peep? Hi... I found your sheep.
Animal Planet is so HD.
I'm okay with it, but the herd itself is very disappointed with the 
Airbnb
Hello, 1-800-SHEEP?  I've got a problem.
Actually, not as awkwardly uncomfortable as you might think.
So I think I’ll call it AirBnBo Peep.
Honey, I'm telling you, it's just National Geographic Wild in the background!
Listen, I'll get baaa-ck to you. I'm a little tied up now.
It's different. Not good-different or bad-different, just different.
THEY ARE EVANGELICALS 
THERE ARE NO BLACK SHEEP
Who are ewe calling?
I won’t be home for the holidays. I’m on the lamb.
It's another rerun, but who's counting?
From Farm to Fork, using "Just In Time" inventory management.
Mary, does this call mean you are not coming home for dinner?
I don’t know man. I think Mary is getting  suspicious.
Like Handel said, "There were shepherds abiding in the rent-controlled flats, keeping watch over their flocks by sight."
Yes, I have them with me, but where am I?
She said she wouldn’t go out with me, too sheepish.
Didn't you hear? This season, wool is in.
The vacation rental brochure said it had a great view, but I think I've been fleeced.

The cable reception’s baaaaaaaaaadd.
Enh, mutton much.
But you said this would help me sleep.
Tell Bo-Peep she left them in her Manhattan loft again.
Yes, is this the residence of a Ms.Little Bo Peep?
Counting sheep with real sheep just isn't the same...
Counting them isn't working.
Hello, Sheep Anonymous?
I don't care if the sleeping pills aren't good for me, this is absolutely ridiculous!
Once I counted all of you, thought you would just move on with your lives.
The black sheep is on EweTube.
So, once I learned how lamb chops were made...
Doctor, I think sleeping pills work a bit better
Is this the Howard Stern show?
No, it’s spelled B...E...A...U.

Well Mary, maybe YOU can still manage in just a studio apartment, but I definitely can't.
Yeah, I finished early today. Wanna grab pizza later?
May I speak to Bo Peep?
I know you're excited for Christmas, but this Twelve Days of Thanksgiving thing is getting a little out of control...
I never found the Meadowlands, not that I mind.

Have you seen the troublemaker?  What?  Yes, the black one’s gone missing.
I'm watching a movie.....but it's a real sleeper.

Not much, just watching Fox News with the flock.
No, this is Ewe-ber.
New York is where I'd rather stay, I get allergic smelling hay!!
Sheep's Meadow was a letdown, but the flowers in our room were delicious.
No worries Maw, big city life's less strange than you reckon!
What? Were you raised in a barn?
They're susceptible to accelerated news cycle driven insomnia like everyone else.
I only said, “ I just don’t get enough sleep.”
I was taking a nap.
Room service!  Send up an acre of fresh grass and a side order of clover.
No, they don't want to watch Animal Planet...
Room service? I'm out of towels.

I wish Mary would hurry back, their fleece aren’t white as snow any more!

I’ve rounded up the ewesual suspects.
Well, those subway maps can be confusing.
Ok, it's not our mountain but you can't complain about the view.
Count me out. I woke up  feeling a bit sheepish.

I’m booked tonight, but you can come over tomorrow night if you want to count them.
She's not in. She's gone searching for her own flock.

PJs on? What's the address?
Room service?  You guys have hay bales on your menu?
Miss Bo Peep, What is the total amount of the reward for the lost sheep?
Apparently it's a "Sheep Meadow" in name only. And why did the Airbnb listing mention "stable hosts"
They're safe from the Wall Street wolves for now
yes we're in for the night.
They just don’t understand ‘unfriending’
We didn’t find any manger, but the cable reception is terrific.

Glad ya liked yer new Attorney General, Mr. President.  Chief-of-Staff, ya say?
Front desk? May I move to another room with shag carpeting?
It's pronounced "herder" not "hoarder"
Yes, it does look like a hat Woody Allen would wear, but he doesn't sleep with sheep, no matter what Ronan Farrow writes in The New Yorker.
I think the one behind the couch is a wolf.
That sure-fire, guaranteed, insomnia cure you recommended. Just what sort of guarantee does it offer?
Hey, Mary. I'm missing one little lamb.
You wouldn' by any chance ... ?
Nothing much; just re-watching that Jodie Foster movie.
Pretty easy, really ... I just have to keep their screen time to less than 2 hours a day.
My neighbors are scared that I herd something...
When I suggested counting sheep for insomnia, I meant imaginary sheep!
But you said this was a room with views.
Home Shopping Network? 
I'd like to order the tan F-L-E-E-C-E jacket.
Trust me, they'll never pull the wool over my eyes
the reception here is a little fuzzy
18,  19, 20,  21
Do you ever feel like you're a bad shepherd?
The AirBnB guarantee for restful sleep.
Nah, we're staying in. Don't want to miss the season premiere of West Wooled.
Betty's not here, she died in the wool
I had to give up on the cats
Sell my stocks now, before I get fleeced.
We could have lamb chops again.
I'm missing one, and now I can't sheep
This IS a big apartment!  It’s NYC!!!
What can I say; we thought we were in New Jersey.
And then I thought "Why not kill two birds with one stone?"
I've found  your sheep.......
Mary had a little boy lamb and a little girl lamb....
300 lbs of grass please. Yes, for delivery.
But Mom, it's the only way I can sleep in this big city.

New York is where I’d rather stay. I get allergic smelling hay. I just adore a penthouse view...
Bo Peep, you're not gong to believe what I found
Let's forget the ransom.
Replace my chewed up carpet and I'll return your sheep.
What do you mean, you don't have extra cots?
Can you please stop making sheep-related puns, this is serious.

I think I'm still missing one.
But the listing said "vibrant outdoor space"...
Hi, I'd like to place an order for a large cheese pizza and ten yards of sod.
I'd like a medium pepperoni and a large blade shear.

But of course, I love ewe!
My lamb was delivered a little too rare.
CHEAP, you idiot! Not SHEEP!
Oh, you now me.  I can't complain.  I take the good with the baaaaad.

Hello AirBNB.  I’d like to file a complaint
Only for a couple of days. Then it’s the rooftop garden.
I found the sheep but you aren’t going to believe where.
It's me.  Beau Peep.  They came home.
Some nay sayers think I’m overleveraged in ovine futures.
Honestly, I thought that being an agent of God would be a little more glamorous.
You could say, "I'm on the lam."
Good news!  I get to spend the holidays working from home.
It's not what I expected when the job description said help eliminate the wolves on Wall Street!
Bo-Peep got Maserati and I got every other weekend.
ok.... who is the wiseguy who tried to order roast sheepdog for dinner?
Great news! I'm getting big bucks to take care of Herb's hi-rise apartment for the summer!  And the best part is that I figured a way of keeping my shepherd job, too!
I found it on AirBaaaaah-n-Baaaaah
Hey Room Service! Where is that Sheepdog I ordered?
I do miss the countryside, but at least my landlord allows pets.
Room service..? “I’ll need more grass!
Yeah, we came upstairs to game plan how to steer clear of the wolves over on Wall St.
What? No, I can hear you just fine. Yeah. I herd.

But I'll come into work just as soon as I do.
I’m just waiting to see which one turns out to be the lion.
I just tried to order the Rams game on Pay Per View.
Wish ewe were here.
Doc, could you suggest another method she could use to fall asleep?
Do you have anything related to Wolf rentals?
I apologize for the noise, but counting them is the only way I can sleep.
How much grass seed do you think I'd need for 500 square feet?
So I told him, 'I got you pegged, wolf! Think you can fleece me?
Does the cable package still include Flocks News?
Hello...Ms. Peep?
I had to leave. My herd feels threatened by everyone out there being such big fox fans.
Speak up, I can't hear a bleating thing!
Hello, Bo Peep?  I've got your sheep.
All your lambs and ewes.
Counting all night did not induce sleep.
That old belief is FAKE NEWS!
How many followers I have?
I've got a bigger problem now.  Little Bo Peep has lost her remote.
We just decided the country life wasn’t our cup of tea...
Well, the Sleep Disorders Clinic can't use us right now.
...well, they can see the meadow from the terrace...
I Shorted wool
Yes, direct from the living room to the kitchen table - it's the latest thing in locavore.
I agree, the visuals caused by your sleep aid are stunning, but I’m still wide awake.
I'm kind of the black sheep of the family.
Their silence is deafening.
I just feel like I am always being followed.
Pee-Ewe
Hey I only ordered ONE sheep
Nah, we'll just stay indoors... It's too easy for them to get lost amongst the sheep in the big city!
Look, mate, this isn't quite what I meant when I said I wanted to take  piece of New Zealand with me.
Hello Bo! I need you to get back to me today!

Housekeeping? We have a problem.
Hey, girl. Netflix and wool?
Room service? Bring me a tossed salad, cream of mushroom soup, a leg of lamb ... nix the leg of lamb. And two bales of hay.
So how was I supposed to know they don’t allow sheep in the Sheep Meadow?
Room service? I’ll have anything except lamb chops.
Siri, if the Lord is my shepherd, how the hell did i end up with all of these sheep?
If they're in fact wolves, then I'll be concerned.
I think we lost our direction.
I can deliver up to 427 sweaters by Christmas.
Bo, this is Blue. We need to talk.
It looks like I misunderstood that mindfulness practice of being the shepherd of your thoughts.
I have to tell you, I'm starting to like this telecommuting thing.
Just before nodding off, I lost count.
Actually, I'm rather near to the madding crowd.
Of course I tried! They didn’t FIT in the elevator.
Hey, Bo. Got 'em all here, wagging.
Bo, have you tried using ‘find my sheep’?
We're all here waiting for the Jet's game to start.
Turns out the Sheep Meadow is actually for tourists.
I would like to report a missing wolf.
You said be fruitful and multiply but it is getting out of hand
Say can you tell me...is there a Guinness World Record for the number of sheep in an elevator?

Hey Bo where were you when you last saw them?
Is there a patron at the bar who ordered a single malt and is bleating away about the seaside of Scotland?  Uhh... white curly hair, woolly legs and a thick brogue.
No, they didn't say anything about sheep, so I gave it a shot.
I gave it a shot, but it didn't work- I 'm still awake
Thanks, but no, I don't need any sheep.
Herding them's a bitch, due to the 'no-dogs' policy.
I thought I ordered a little lamb, not a litter of lambs?!
exactly what time will you be getting here Little Bo?
Tell Lil Bo I found em
Sorry, I can't come out. I had to bring some work home over the weekend.
But the [AIRBNB] listing said "overlooking Sheeps Meadow"
What do you mean, The flowers do fade, and wanton fields
To wayward winter reckoning yields? I got central heat and free cable.
No, we are not going to put on "Little Bo Peep goes to the city" until all of you settle down and face the screen.
I know they could help me sleep but that's not the problem right now.
Baa Baa,  humbug.
I'll try them for now mom, but once I get use to the sounds of the big city I'll sleep fine?
“Hey, Bo, I found them. They’re right here in your apt. I got in without a peep from the Super.”
"They wanted to watch the Muppets sing 'Mary Has a Little Lamb'.
Oh, I found the sheep, but in late capitalism how do I find myself?
Not baaad, how are you?
Actually, sheep are one thing; clutter is another.
Hi Honey how much wool do you need to make that sweater?
Don’t you just hate artificial turf?
I found the sheep. Check Trump Tower for Bo Peep.
Yes, I am the co-op board president.
I made it to the city and got a sheep rate on a hotel room.
My flock runneth over.
On second thought, I should have gotten the cottage with the yard.
Hello, Room Service, please send ten bales of clover to room 500.
Yo Bo, I’ve found them but they’re not coming home without you!
The new place is very shabby sheep

One of you had better cough up the remote, or there wool be consequences!
Room service? I thought I ordered lamb chops.
It's a hand puppet!  And she's a ventriloquist!
'Yeah, I'm doing home office today'
Tell Bo-Peep it wasn't a dream.
Little Bo Peep, I found your sheep!
All that the note said was "Please cancel the order.  A cup of warm milk at bedtime seems to have solved the problem."
We're on a cultural exchange with urban sheep.
I'm just glad the dog isn't here.
Do you remember where we left the Roombahbah?
The insomnia got so bad, I thought, why count 'em when I can join 'em?
Room Service? Send up some fresh grass and a beer.
No,the sheep are just fine. But the big screen TV went out right before the Giants game.
Well, it's far from the madding crowd.
They say the counting helps with sleep, but frankly, I'm really close to trying something else.
The pay's definitely better, but the traffic is worse...
Hello, there's one missing
It seems the sheep are dyslexic. They confused “pied-a-terre” for “pasture” on Airbnb.
Can you send up more towels?
Sheep Meadow is closed for the season! But my ewes have a reservation!
Room service? No not  a bottle of sherry a pair of shears is what I need
It's been a baaaad day at the office.
I'd love to see ewe, but I'm feeling a little sheepish.

Hello, Doctor Ince, could you please renew my prescription for Ambien, as soon as possible ?
Yes, can I speak to my realtor? I was told there would be an adjoining pasture to this complex.
I didn’t say I approve of the dowry tradition mom, I just said I really want to marry her.
My therapist suggested a better work-life baaaalance...
I do like the new carpeting but I'm starting to regret not opting for the stain resistant treatment.
It was the only apartment available on Air Bed and Bible.
Who ate the remote?
This is why I am an atheist. If the Lord was my shepherd he would get the f---k (guess again, for those of you with dirty minds, the word has three dashes– it's  flock) out of here.
Doc, TV or counting sheep does not work.
The Doctor said counting sheep might help.
Hello Ms. Bo Peep? I have some good news ...
Yes, yes, I herd you.
It’s like herding cats at the office.
Ms. Peep? Yeah, we found your sheep, but you're not gonna like the association dues
Yes, Mom, I am watching the news and I have no problem getting to sleep afterwards.
No, Bo-peep, but you lost them last time.
Bible study’s better than I thought.
Fine. We'll watch Fox News. Again.
Hello room service? We’re still waiting for those bells.
You're watching this too? Believe me, I know a wolf in sheep's clothing when I see one.
I think I'm gonna cancel the date. I don't know I'm feeling sheepish.
What do you mean 'the cell phone gps shows my exact location...?'
I'm getting the flock out of here.
Half sausage and half pasture plants.
The reception here is fine. Yes, I herd you.
I'm thinking of taking the kids to the zoo.
Yes, master.  I understand.  Under the new tax code you get all three bags full.
Your Bo-Peep package included everything I didn't want
I'm trying a non-medical remedy for my insomnia.
Meet me at 5 at our usual watering hole.
I thought maybe this would be a cure for my insomnia.
Room Service, this is Ms. Bopeep in room 309. I need 20 bales of alfalfa, and a shop-vac.
Man, I really am a hoarder.
Insomnia hotline?  Yes, I tried the couch but I still keep losing sheep.
Some border collies, STAT!
‘Hey boss, looks like Mary’s on the lam again’.
I won't be in the office today - I'm gathering wool.
Hey, Bo-Peep, I've found your sheep.
It’s a long story but apparently it’s an issue with the landlord.
I finally have the three bags full.   Can I make my tailor appointment for the wool suit?
So I’m counting the sheep now, what’s next
Well boss, you told me that I was to give them the first class treatment so that’s why we are staying at the Four Seasons.
That was a bad idea, I'll never fall asleep now.
No big plans,maybe just a quiet night,a little Netflix and Twill.
It's amazing how many you get for one monkey, and you can relax, because they're not the least bit curious.
Talk to ewe later.
It's been months since we've gotten a farm gig.
House sitting is harder than it sounds.
They keep following me around without thinking thru what I really stand for.
I wish that woman at the time share presentation hadn’t been so darn convincing...
Relax - I'm up on my rent, so there are no wolves at the door!
Oh, not doing much. Just watching TV and tending my flock.
Yea. My mom let me get a virtual reality game system, but she gets to pick the games.
I’m just not ready to give up my rent-controlled apartment
So, they put me in the Witness Protection Program and set me up in a great downtown condo. But this cover job as a sheep herder really stinks!
Can you hear me, now? Yea, Jack and Jill, this is Little Bo.  I found them . . . in an Airbnb with a very generous pet policy.
I started counting backwards, now I'm wide awake.
I guess without Arabs, Jews, and foreigners, the nativity is just this jackass and you sheep.
I love the staff at this Airbaa'n'baa.
I was sheeping, but that's ok...
Twelve. But I'm still wide awake.
I can see why you thought that, but no, I never said anything about moving to the country.
Eventually I’m going to fall asleep
Very nice! I will definitely use Airbaanbaa again.
My roommates don't give me any privacy.
Just roughly I figure there's about a dozen, zzzzzzz.
I've never slept better on vacation
Yes, one spicy tuna roll and 12 orders of edamame.
I got tired of crying“wolf”.
Oh, pastoral. You?
I think I typed in the wrong address on Google maps.
I can't take them anywhere till the dog walker gets back.
Yes, Mom, you were right and I was wrong, OK? I never thought they'd find my  new home in Manhattan.
OK Bo Peep, you've got to stop losing them!
Counting sheep didn't help; it only made me a shepherd.
Apparently, the grass is always greener on TV.
I told you, FOX & FRIENDS starts in a half hour!
Yeah, I’m still watching those Trump voters.
Hi, I'm calling about your 'flock rate' discount for flights to the Holy Land...
BO PEEP? RELAX,THEIR NOT LOST.
What? You don't sell bales, just grams and ounces?
No, insomnia is even worse!
It's the only way we can afford to live in an apartment in Brooklyn.
Twelve.
No Mary, your lamb is not here, try the bedroom
i just can't sleep......
Ya Bo, what is it that you lost again?
I'm bringing lamb chops.
The sheep were tired of the meadow.
Ms. Peep, I found your sheep grazing in my living room.
Right now they're really enjoying the State of the Union.
Yeah, mom. Bo-Peep pulled the wool over my eyes and left me!
Yes, PLEASE tell Miss Peep to pick up her sheep!
I know!  I know!  I couldn't believe it either, but they're as happy as ever!!
They're restless right now, waiting for "Heidi" to come on.
Yup, and wagging their tails behind them.
I decided to use the GPS app on my phone this time - and you won't believe where I ended up!
We should be fine. I placed an order with Graze.
No, ​they're good. But they say a shepherd's​ crook is not allowed in the building without a permit​.
Do  you have any designs for sweaters?
But it gets me thinking about work, which is why I can’t fall asleep in the first place.
Yeah I've tried counting but they just keep coming.
Hello,  is this the missing persons bureau?  I'd like to report a young lady named "Bo Peep"  who asked me to watch her sheep for five or ten minutes so she could take a potty break - but that was quite a long time ago and she hasn't returned" !
I am selling to the master, dame and Little Boy who lives down the lane
I'm getting ready to go to sleep.
Yo, Mom, guess where I found them?
My AirBnB offers farm to coffee table service, yes.
We won’t be coming in today
I always feel a bit sheepish when I call in sick.
Can I call you back? We’re watching the Rams bleat the Jets.
But what´s the problem? You told me it`s a sheep apartement... .
' You've reached "I Watch Ewes", Harold speaking.'
No, officer, that's not the type of grass I was looking for in my room service order.
I said we need a cheap apartment, Mary.
Damnit, Matthew. Whatever I do, I can't seem to shake these last 12.
Yes, I've counted them, but I still can't sleep.
Little Bo Peep I found them!
I'm not sure what happened, but they keep asking for Hannity.
I don't understand it. I've been counting sheep since yesterday. I still can't get to sleep. And worse I'm dressing like Little Bo-Peep
Peep, we have a problem.
I'm calling it Herd-BnB. We're just lining up our second round of funding.
Lorraine, I’m telling you... they misunderstood when I said I was hurting.
Are you kidding? The people I swapped homes with brought their cat with them.
When I made the reservation, I asked for " a Room with a View,"  not a Room for a Ewe!
You were right, Airbnb was a ton cheaper.
Hi, it’s me Lil Peep, call off the missing sheep  alert, I found them!
Hi Customer Support, I ordered 20 of your Night Night Sleep Sheep but I think I'm missing the fence?
Come on over! Go past the still water then follow the valley of the shadow of death and your here!
I'd like to order some alfalfa hors d'oeuvres and 16 vodka and Woolite martinis
9-1-1? Yeah I'd like to report another wolf sighting
'The co-op just told me that no dogs are allowed."
Yes, I heard about the new wool tariff.
Not exactly what I had in mind as a bishop.
The Rabbi in the joke said if I sent them outside, the apartment would seem a lot more spacious. But they obviously don't get the joke and keep coming back in.
I'm very sorry you can't get to sleep, but I told you- we're on sick leave!
You're the one who wanted to move to the city!
Ms. Bo Peep ?
Might you have a German Shepherd on the staff?
Well, did you even ask if it was a flock friendly hotel?
.....and don’t forget to bring plenty of dip.
When I began my career as a shepard, there was a lot more green space in the big city.
Hello...is this eharmony?
Did you say "sheep in the meadow" or "sheep in the Marriott"?
Like we, they've gone astray, Miss Peep.  
They got off on the wrong floor.
Naaah, Zeke, I still can’t sleep but it’s easier to count them now!
You're sure this is the way Attenborough got started?
I’ll be down at the park in 5, we’re just finishing Far from the Madding Crowd.
City sprawl moved faster than we could...
So the cable guy wants me to bundle my TV, internet, and phone package, but I said ,'You're not going to pull the wool over my eyes!'  I'm not going to be sheepish. These guys sure know how to fleece ya!
...and I said to the officer, "Well how was I supposed to know the Sheep Meadow isn't really a sheep meadow?"
Hi Fred. Listen, if you see Peep, tell her not to worry.
It is very hard falling asleep when you try to accurately count Live Sheep!
Does that package come with ewetube?
Couldn't we have tried a warm glass of milk first?
Hello, Peapod, your grass delivery is late—again.
Hey Bo Peep... Yeah it’s Pied Piper... Uh huh, got the breakup text.
Hey Mary!  It's Shep.....
I'm back from shepherding, but selling everything off is taking some time.
What can I say? It was Black Sheep Friday.
As soon as Sesame Street is over we'll all go down to Central Park.
Yea, and if I am dreaming, I'm afraid of what comes next!
I counted all of them three times and it’s still not working.
Bah-bye!
My therapist tells me I can't keeping bring my work home with me but now my landlord's on my case too
I lost my Border Collie!
Don't worry mom, I've got everything under control.
I've taken herding to a new level.
I nailed my Halloween costume but I haven’t figured out what to do with that sheep yet
Mary!, Mary!!
I just needed a change of scenery, you know, to get away from it all
Yeah, hi, I’d like to take a personal day.
I said order in from Shake Shack, not Sheep Shack.
I was just trying to get away for the weekend and they followed me here.
Bo Peep? Never heard of you.
Hello?  I enjoy your conspiracy theory news network but take offense at your use of the term ‘sheeple.
311? May I respectfully asked why the mayor opened the Sheep Meadow to bike traffic?
...and hold the dressing on the salads.
We got a great Friends and Family package deal.
I'm done. The shag carpet is now berber.
Little Bow Peep, please
They Also Have A Suite For Lamas
Can't make it to the party tonight. Feeling a bit sheepish.
Hey. I herd ewe called.
And I thought the rental ad for ""'Wool"' Floors Throughout" was just a typo.
This should put an end to my sheepless nights.
I took the subsidies and headed for higher ground.
Black sheep?...no, uptown.
Yes I count them every night but I don’t see how that’s supposed to help me sleep.
Uber? What's the biggest van you've  got?
Honey... please come back!
I promise I'll NEVER 
bring my work home with me again.
Where are you? I only rented them for the hour!  It's going to screw up lil Bo Peep role-play if you are much later.
Airbnb offers me the kind of experience a hotel can’t. It even comes with a shepherd’s crook…
Yes, I've tried everything, and I still can't get to sleep.
You do know wool shrinks when it gets wet.
Blah blah blah... I hear it my sleep.
Am I awake?
Binge-watching. Counting these babies just wasn't working for me.
I don't know what I'm doing here either mom; the senators flew me in yesterday.
This insomnia is awful.
Of course I wiped my boots before I came in!
Yes, I'd like to order a dozen bales of alfalfa, half with extra cheese and 3 with pepperoni.
Thank you. They do shut up when I press Mute.
She wanted to see what I did for work.
I'm confused. I thought you said "til the cows come home"...
Our work from home programs really stinks.
The green roof is a plus, but the 'no dogs' policy is a problem.
No! On Wall Street?
That’s right, boss, a wolf. I’m going to have to take a personal day.
Mr. Roberts, do you take them out to do their business all at once or one by one?
I finished counting them but I am still wide awake.
Yes, it took a lot of time, and I thank you. But it's just not working. Have anything with dramamine?
No I ordered a sheep skin coat not sheep kin!
Little Bo Peep's Lost and Found--how can I help you?
So how are the wolves from Wall St doing on the job exchange?
The reception here is baaaad
I only realized when I got home that I have been fleeced.
‘Not ewe, you!”
I need ten large veggie pizzas with extra cud.
No !  I said flock .
But I already counted them, though.
An acre of grass, and large pie.
Bo-Peep here on the forty-fifth floor.  Yes, somehow they’re all back, tails and all .
Maybe we should consider renting a condo in Sheepshead Bay.
Man, my augmented reality is soooo immersive.
I'm on the last episode and the flock is getting restless, can you come take them for a walk?
It said on airbnb that it had great views of the parade, NFL Ticket and it was pet friendly...
The difficulty taking the flock to the park will be the elevator.
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
Don't worry about it. I'll have them home in time for the shearing season.
Yes, We are Legit - No Black sheep here
Damn it, Mary!
I guess I must have lost count for a moment there.
I was on my way to Grandmother's house and  they just came along.
I've tried everything and the picture's still fuzzy.
Wool I’m kinda penned in right now. Being a crook on the lamb in this sheep hotel is just a baaad situation
We all seem to be sheep in the big city crowd.
Well I guess you were right when you said that grass was greener back home.
They seem to know it's you.
I can't talk to you right now.  I am too busy counting sheep.
Still Searching for Black  Sheep.
In theory, it could have been a very successful business, however, there just doesn't seem to be a demand for mascots at mattress stores.
I'm watching it now. Looks Baaad.
After she gave me the staff, Little Go Peep just walks out the door!
Is Mary back from Cancun yet?
I keep counting them, but still can't sleep.
They like to watch the Rams play."
Peter Klebnikov, New York, New Yor
He's giving a press conference. I know a crook when I see one.
The house swap is okay... It does have a gorgeous green view, next to a park, but it's on the 23rd floor. The sheep aren't thrilled.
All say ' love you too'
How do you want me to fall asleep with sheep with no fence?
Hurry or you'll miss the Eweshour.
I'm gonna take the day off today, boss.   Feeling a little sheepish.
Fake news keeping you up too?
If you sleep over, you can count them.
You 'herd' me the first time? Real funny, pal.
The traffic is so bad, I’m still on the south side of the living room.
Yes - I'd like 15 large Veggie-Lovers pizzas
But the Central Park Sheep Meadow across the street was your big selling point!
Don't worry Mom, the whole divorce went smoothly. I got most her assets among other items.
Well, this way it's MUCH easier than herding cats.
Wait - you mean to tell me that all of your Halloween costumes are shipped with extra accessories?
I used the Find Your Sheep app.
Marge, I’m desperate.  Which channel is Animal Planet?
No, Mary, I have more than one little lamb
I really like the ewe up here.
Hail, Mary?
I wanted to get away for a few days. Do you always have to follow me around like...oh,never mind.
How was I supposed to know that when you told me to "count sheep" to help me fall asleep you meant metaphorically?
Not much; just Netflix and wool.
This is Mary
A sheepdog?  Whatever for?
I thought they said " pen house" .
No, that was one order of yellow curry and 15 orders of weeds, with an 's,' but best of luck with... Yes, I've seen the research....
Hello. May I speak with Little Bo Peep?
So far everything's been peaceful - but the lion hasn't arrrived yet.
I need Babe and I need him NOW!
Hi Doc,  
Anything else for insomnia? The counting sheep are bahd.
I can't come help you sleep right now, I'm already booked for tonight.
Is this your idea of a sheep trick?
They ate the philodendron.
This ISN'T going to jeopardize their free range status!!
The TV is so HD that it's like I'm seeing it in real life!
I'm looking for a classic pre- war six stall.
Martha, for the last time they don't want to see you.
I asked for 11 woolen sweaters!
...and Mussolini said they can’t be trusted with their own freedom.
'The crook I ordered was supposed to come with the built-in flashlight"
Nothing, hanging out with my fur babies.  You?
They heard the latest episode of "Sheeping Up With the Kardashirams" was on TV and rushed in.
My flock likes to stay on the Upper East Side these days.
Oh nothing...How about ewe?
The first date went well, but she’s kind of a goat herder.
Bad news...they figured out how to bribe the doorman.
This really doesn't help with my insomnia
But they're not pets.
One Shepherd’s Pie, extra cheese, and a Diet Coke.
I can get them to NYC, but I can't get them to watch the same show.
I asked for 99!
The view is amazing, but I’m seriously rethinking the ‘Urban Sheppard’ experience.”
I'd like to order twelve salads and one lamb chop.
I'm feeling a little sheepish asking you this, but...
I left them alone but they won’t go home.
we're hiding from the big bad wolf
Did you jiggle the handle?
Don't tell me I'm sheepish, I know sheepish when I see it"
Yeah, the landlord wore wool clothing. Why do you ask?
Nice chatting, but I've got to get the flock outta here.
I'm so glad that your all Ram's fans too!"
That's what ewe said!
Ms Peep, send the finder's money to my PayPal account then I'll get your stinking sheep back to you.
...right, and do you have any ivy?
Hello? I need to get the flock outta here!
Bo, missing something?
We were being stalked by a wolf, so I brought them home with me.
What can I say?  These retaliatory tariffs on wool are messing up my life.
I'm a nativity New Yorker.
Room service? Party here in 524. Send up a fifth of Woolite.
Yes, your order for a sleep-aid is ready to be picked up.
I'm gonna have to call you baaaack.
It was easy I changed my ring tone to baaà
Come on over! It's lamb for dinner!
Room Service? Another 14 bales of hay.
The picture is terrible. No, I can't be here between noon and 5.
Is this the residence of Little Bo Peep?
The meta-pastoral studies program here just isn't theoretical enough for me.
I'm telling you, Mom, sheep-hoarding might be my calling.
Mom, I haven't been 'little' for some time and I know exactly where to find them.
I was just trying to take a nap
Okay, so I'm an overachiever. I still can't sleep!
I don’t know, Bo. I guess they followed you here last night.
No, I haven't met with the owners to show them their new organic wool carpet
Even if it's bad, they'll watch. It's like they think they're supposed to.
Mary...Mary? Can you hear me now?
Sheep yoga is the new thing.
Circe?... she just left.
"Sounds like a plan.  You know, I've been trying to get the flock out of  this town for years.
One for the Master. One for the mill. Not so sure I owe a whole bag to the little boy who lives on the hill.
It's still saying "No HDMI Input Source."
Elevation's good, but they're a little confused.
My staff agrees that I am the best leader since the beginning of time.
Is this the Bo-Peep residence?
This costume is so convincing, I attracted TWELVE sheep on my walk home!
Well, at least I didn't get fleeced for the room.
What do you mean, the Wool Network costs extra?"
I think my Google GPS needs attention.
The bulls and the bears haven't been able to get out of a narrow trading range.  So, I am advocating diversity to shake things up.
It’s a nice enough Airbnb, but we can’t decide between Shetland and Black-ish.
Fifty pounds of grass, and a side of curds and whey.
No, no, I think you have the wrong number.  This isn't the Good Shepherd, this is Dan the Barely Passible Shepherd.
Hello, Air bnb? We're really not happy - the ad said unobstructed views!
Oh, hey doc. I was wondering if you could prescribe 
something a wee bit stronger please?
Just tell Little Bo that she must have lost them.
Yes, hello Ms. Bo Peep. I'm calling about the sheep...
It started with the bees on the roof, and it's been all downhill from there.
Nope, not opposed to occasional business travel.  And that would be a big yes, I do see myself as more of a leader-type.
I guess this is what happens when you take your work home.
About the poop, Bo Peep . . .
Well, they don't mind housesitting, but I’m getting claustrophobic.
So I’m like, you know where you can put your meadow......
The Global Warning made them nervous so we moved to higher ground.
Hi, is this Little Bo Peep?
I know where Little Bo Peep lost her sheep.
You won't believe what I herd.
We're fine. How's ewes doin'
I think we need a recount
I'm calling to report the audience survey figures.
We’re binge herding.
Yeah, the couch is fine. I can get plenty of sheep anywhere.
Mary isn't here, this is her cousin, Lary.
Yes, I herd ewes
Wow, I slept unbelievably well.  Counting sheep really works!
Life in the big  city? Well you know, it really separates the sheep from the goats.
Oh yeah we're doing great- they're loving the fresh, um. . . country air.
Yes, doc I tried it, but frankly I don't see how this is supposed to put me to sleep…
No, sorry, I can't go out... yes, well, it works better than melatonin.
I'm really not sure you're going to like "The Silence of the Lambs."
I'd like to cancel my Netflox subscription.
Room service? Yes, I can't find Sheepflix...and the flock is getting restless.
Yes, yes, I got the new sheep sofa.
Yes, Mom, I'm still very sheepish when dealing with my work staff.
They said this wasn't a baa-ed neighborhood.
Yeah, I really should have thought about the sheep before I signed the lease on a fifth floor walk-up.
If I had watched the news earlier I would've ran for president too, it seems I have the required skillset.
Relax!  I'm watching, I'm watching!
The cane is no longer fooling them, it's only a matter of time now.
Little Bo-Peep, get your ass over here.
They weren't too happy about the wool couch, but otherwise they feel like they may safely graze.
I'm watching Baaaack to the Future.
Being an urban farmer just wasn't enough for me.
I did leave them alone never thinking they could trace me.
I got bombed in the Whiffenpoof  Bar last night and you'll never believe where I wound up this morning, and with whom.
Yes, I am looking for a field where sheep may safely graze.
No, turns out there were plenty of rooms at the inn.
Shepherding ain't what it used to be. I know.
Stacy, I' m not lying! I have sheep! 11.....no 12 of them, and a cane. Stacy I have a cane.
Add seven, no make that eight, wait ELEVEN egg rolls with that please.
Bopeep? I found your sheep.
You were right. They just needed some time alone.
Even with the one bedroom, it hasn't been baaaaahd.
It is the final episode of Lassie
You told me to count sheep to get to sleep!
I only have eyes for ewe
Yup, left the black sheep in Times Square.”
No, nothing special. Just sitting around shooing the sheep.
Auckland is wonderful.
Batteries not included? What do you take me for, a goat herder?
Hello BoPeep they’re here.
Hello Peep, I found your sheep!
It started raining!
Okay.... which one of you called me dad?
Okay, one more bedtime story before you get to sleep”
Well, you know how my wife gets when work follows me on vacation.
Room service...? I’d like a bushel of grass... and a hamburger.
This AirBNBaa is ok - but it's a little far afield.
I used ''shepard" figure-of-speechly, not matter-of-factly.
No. I did not open the sofa bed first. Would that help?
No, my name is NOT Mary!
Hello? Uber?
Why the guests? Well, I don't know. All I remember last night was that I couldn't sleep.
Fake News.  I know exactly where they are; right here with me; where they belong.  I have never lost a sheep in my life.
Hello? Yes, I seem to have a fuzzy connection.
Tonight, I'm trying a new all-natural sleep aid.
I'd like to order a bale of grass edibles.
We took a wrong ewe turn.
Yeah, I found the place on AirBaa-n-Baa.
Somebody's putting up condos where they used to graze, but I found a pretty nice AirBnB.
Mary has a little lamb-hoarding problem and needs help.
I get it but they are not lambs.
and of course, the cow is NOT in the corn
Sorry, guys. I've found something more helpful to get sleeping...
When I said you are the black sheep of the family, I was not being literal.
Have you seen my dog?
The cows may be in the corn, but the sheep are definitely not in the meadow.
Bo Peep? How much longer?
My doctor says the best way to cure my insomnia is to count sheep.
Mary, quick question, that lamb ... would you portray it as an outlier or, and I'm just speculating, symptomatic of a general trend?
Yo. David here.
Oh, it's on the 4th moor not the floor?
They really pulled the wool over my eyes with this "organic" holiday sale.
Like I said when I checked in—because I can’t sleep without counting them.
Oh, heard of sheep. That's not what I thought you meant.
...then he says he can’t sleep since I threw him out”
Is this 1-800-BoPeep?
Yeah, QVC? I’ll take a couple of those Grandmaster Shearers.
I have been counting sheep and still cannot sleep
There's some discontent, but we're wintering in town.
Now? I’m watchin’ t.v. like the rest of ewe’s guys.
Trump has his problems I have mine.
No, you did not wake me up.
I'm starting to rethink this cane...
Is the wool free range? Well, they have 1 & 1/2 baths, which is quite uncommon in this zip code.
Are we having a field day today?
I just got back from the park.
Mary had a hi-rise condo too
GrunbHub? Can you bring 3 bales mixed clover, 1 each rye grass and fescue to 49 Country Lane ASAP?
Could you please deliver a hamburger, sweet tea, and three hundred blades of grass?
So I DID tell the guy down at the deli that I wanted lamb and,well,he called my bluff.
I tried to lose them!
Don't call me when I'm at the office.
We stay until Friday, just in case they have another turkey shortage this year.
The ewes keep standing in front of the news
I don't know how they got here either,Bo-Peep!
Yes, I’m aware the ad said, “dog walker”...
So, I've taken the "farm" out of "farm to table"
We're moving on up; we finally got a piece of the shepherd's pie.
You know;  Sheep in, sheep out.
Remember what you told me to do for my insomnia?   I followed your directions..  What do I do now?
Thanks for taking my call, Dr. Phil.  About your tips on insomnia...
Bo, found them in Sheep's Meadow: of all places!
I gotta get off  these pills...
Hey, Little Bo-Peep, I found your sheep
Call me Baa Baa Back
Ms. Peep? Yeah, it looks like they came back to your old home again. Yup, waggin’ their tails behind ‘em. They’re yours.
Yeah...I’m calling for a wolf exterminator.
'Join the gig economy,' they said. 'They're the jobs of the future,' they said.
I think I took a wrong turn.
No idea where Bo’Peep is but I have her sheep if you see her
We're up here on Brokeback Couch. Where are you?
I don't know, we have become very attached to the new situation.
I'm telling ewe, that 3-D printer has changed my life!
I'm going to move! My flat mates make too much mess."
Hello, is this the Ace Carpet Cleaning Company?
Can't make it.  You didn't mention that there's wolves on Wall Street.
Can I have the number of a Little Bo-Peep?
I dunno...Peep threw me her staff and yelled 'quit calling me Little!'
Well I couldn't have some wannabe sheep herder saying I'd lost them again.
I've go this terrific job house sitting for Sam Sephard."
YES    we guarantee  no sleep problems but you  must take the lot
Wait...it’s ‘until the cow come home’?
Six months ago this was all scrubby Outback.
You wouldn't believe the gig I got with the shepherd-sharing app.
Mary, it's Harry.  I think your lambs are confused.
No, Boy Blue's in the meadow, fast asleep.  I'm Boy Red, and I'm awake in Bensonhurst.
Please tell BoPeep to stop shopping and get back to the hotel now!!
He is white and wooly, Yes, I said white and wooly - last seen on the Q train Express.
I'm sheeping a lot these days.
I got them in the village, at the artisinal sheep shop.
I have a little lamb problem.
chillin, ewe?
But when I signed the lease, I told you I needed green space for my flock.
The transition to city life has been tough, but we've become big fans of Los Angeles football.
David couldn’t sleep with the knowledge that each time he counted one or two went missing.
Yeah...I did fall asleep in a hurry, but when I woke up, they'd all jumped back over.
I signed up for this app where they message me if they need a shepherd for a few hours.
Yeah, Bo Peep? You’re gonna need more than one Uber.
Airbnb is cheaper than pasture land!
Hello, Mary, we have an interesting problem with your promiscuous little lamb.
Bo Peep with two Es
Sominex  worked better!
They're looking for a lone wolf.
Peep wants a divorce.
Welcome to Livelamb, your fresh delivery service, you’re speaking with Abraham.
No, I haven't lost any; I've found a dozen.
No, no, not the car service.  It’s Ewe-ber!
This is Bo Peep reporting ... I've finally found them
I'm house sitting for Little Bo Peep.
I'd like to order a dozen grass and clover pizzas for delivery please.
Greener pastures did not mean Park Avenue and satellite TV.
The cows are in the corn ?
Have you heard of method acting? The Nativity play is going to be a masterpiece.
Mary, which one's yours?
No you've got the wrong number, this isn't the "good Shepherd," this is actually the "meh Shepherd." I work out of New York City
I tried hanging out in Central Park, but they didn't want to miss Survivor.
Doc, it didn't work their bleating kept me awake.
I . said: Where are my peeps?
Well, if we check out first thing in the morning and catch the earliest train, we should be out to pasture by breakfast time. And, until then, I shouldn't have any trouble getting to sleep.
So I started counting sheep like you told me to...
I decided to try taking a staycation.
Mom, we have a problem.  They are saying none of the sheep is Merino enough for the winter collection.
It's really not as hard as you said it would be
Text Senator Peep we found 'em
It's a living!
No,I'm not the Shepherd of the Hills, I'm the Shepherd of Murray Hill
Joel Trubetki was 43 and living with his brother downtown when he decided Literalism was the New Surrealism.
Don't worry Donald, they're still with us... so far.
Is that AirBaaNBaa?
Send up the barber and make it snappy.
Counted the sheep but still no sleep.
Listen, were safe here, Little Bo Peep will never think of looking for them at my mom's apartment.
Yo, Peep! I think your wait is over.
You didn’t mention Dolly had sisters.
I got the sheep rate online.
Just 'till Tuesday.  She needs 'em for her yoga class.
I wanted them to feel more comfortable at work. So I told them not to think of me as their shepherd but as their friend...
The TV is set to watch "Sheep May Safely Gaze", but a lot of them still seem anxious.
No! I'm the Jesus of  59th street.
Are you sure they're not wolves in sheep's clothing?
How about I bring in lamb kebobs to the holiday party tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm just with the guys.
" Have Ms. Bo Peep try the Old Sheppard  Arms, room 307."
Mary, honey, this is your dad.  You've got to get back here right away.  Your in-laws are looking for you .
I've secured the sheep
I know it's daylight, but I'm still counting
Room service, send up a hamburger, coffee, and a bale of clover.”
Can ewe hear me?
Hi Little Bo, I found them.
Hi, is this the number for the Shears catalog?
I told the doorman to send you up, not ewes up!
Those Wolf of Wall Street wannbe types won't know what hit'em tomorrow.
Sleep, perchance to....knit
They say they can't leave 'til they see the fake news.
Weren't they supposed to help me sleep?
Oh, I shepherded ’em, boss . . . Right into the city. Now we can sell sweaters “MADE IN BROOKLYN”!
Sorry, Bo-Peep can't come to the phone right now.  She's fast asleep after counting too many sheep last night.
I'm just the petsitter.  The Clooneys aren't here at the moment.
Baaad news. Insomnia again.
Not only did we go to the wrong lane, but the boy only wanted black wool.
Hello, MiracleGro? Can I order take-out?
Hello, Ewe-ber customer service? Calling to report a lost sheep. .
Bo peep here...no they're not lost. Don't know how, but they rented a room in a high rise, so we'll be here thru the weekend.
It's not as bad as I thought it would be when the ranch went condo
I don't know wher Bo is but I found his friggen sheep.
Hello Room Service, this is Mr. Shepherd on the 4th floor, Room 10. Please send a bale of hay up, my guests are hungry.
I'd like to order ten bales of hay and  shovel.
From Loft to Table
I want to speak to Little Bo Peep.
Yes, I'd like to order an avocado toast, some peanut butter brittle, and forty pounds of clover for my little bro peeps."
Relax, Jacob. The flock is fine. Just put on something called "Silence of the Lambs" to make them feel more at home.
At this rate, they’d follow me off a, well, it rhymes with stiff.
Miss Bo-Peep, please..........
yes, 3 square yards of sod. 7B is the apartment. Doorman will let you up. And no wolves clothing
Wool futures are  up; I'm ready to release the sheep.
Ok, we can watch Silence of the Lambs, or the Rams are playing the Bears...
So I said “Flock Ewe”, It’s cold outside.
Have you seen The Wolf of Wall Street?
Turns out they could care less about Fox News.
Yes I am the Artisanal Sleep Expert
WHO WANTS PIZZA?
Sure we know there are no wolves in Central Park but we've gotten to like temperature and humidity controls.
You were right. If the president isn't yelling, the lose interest fast.
It's a nice room, furnished, huge TV, carpet that used to be shag.
I’d like a small pizza, extra cheese, and twelve sides of white clover.
I need to gather the sheep and get the flock out of here.
We can't seem to get our act together here 'cause there's no dogs allowed.
Hello, Room Service? This is Little BoPeep in Room 1253. Could I get 10 bales of hay and 12 buckets of corn.
Hello, Ubaah?
Yup, I left them alone and they came home. Wagging? I'll get back to you.
Yo, Bo Peep, wassup , gir?  Been thinking about you.
Hey Sally... I am taking a day off.
And I'll need a dozen lions for them to lie down with.
I just Hope they don't expect me to clean out the Elevator!
That's all right. When I think who we elected President, I feel sheepish, too.
I prefer the title "Project Manager", but yes, I'm the guy you want to speak with.
Tell Bo-Peep she’ll have to wait.
This should reduce my screen time.
Ba, Ba , Ba , etc.
Yes, hello? Do I know ewe?
Maintenance?  I need that sod I ordered.  Now.
Yep, down for her nap like a little lamb, without a peep.
Yeah, I'm totally lost here.
I forgot the grass.
Binging on Breaking Baaa'd
Why do they always put the grazing forecast at the very end?
Yes, I ordered 100 pounds of grass. Hold on, someone’s at the door.
I lost a sheep
We are still waiting. The astroturf was supposed to be delivered yesterday
No, that won't work. I find counting sheep stimulating.
It's a new religion, and I have a new title: "Pastor".
Yes.  You promised my TV package would include EWE-Tube and we can't seem to find it!
Room Service? What kind of grass was that you sent? My sheep seem off.
Yeah ,sure come on over I’ve always got room for one more
Hi QVC? Yea I actually ordered the samurai sword, not the shepherd starter kit.
Number One, I really don't think this cover story works for this mission...
I asked her if she would knit me a sweater.
Room service, I'd like sheep shears and two knitting needles.
The dog is bringing back takeout.
Sorry Bo Peep, Serta is now offering $50.00 a head. Can you do better?
Can't get any sleep in this city
Hi, Pa! Every thing alright here... The girls miss you though, and send their love.
Can you say that again? My connection is a bit fuzzy.
No, I didn’t say “Send the flock.” I said “Set the clock.”
Guess what I herd? ... Sheep.
Babe" is on HB
I want to talk to my broker, the one that told me to hold off on selling my sheep commodities.
There are 24 and I still can't sleep.
Look!  I'm sorry! This is the best I can do since they removed the sheep meadow from Central Park!
Hello, 911? I'd like to report a wolf.
Hello, Petflix? I'd like to cancel my subscription.
I find the HD is too real.
Yes, this is Mr. Bo Peep. I would like to order the magic shears for $49.99 plus shipping and handling.
Down in front!
Hey, is this Little Bo Peep?
I saw the story about you on the news.
The doctor had a new recommendation for my sleeping disorder, “ewe” will never guess!
Funny story...  I thought you said "sheep with me."
But I'm not tired.
Hi Mom... City life isn't so bad, just really cramped compared to what I'm used to.
It's Lil' Bo Peep. Yeah, I found them.
Even though they aren't pets, I still had to sneak them in.
Just hanging out here watching Netflox.
911?   I have to find  Little Bo Peep...
Hello? Mrs. Bo Peep? Yes, I seem to have found your sheep.
Can I return a Halloween costume?
Nothing.  What are ewe doing?
Bo Peep?  I think you have the wrong number.
Counting sheep, but still can't sleep.
Bo Peep here. Yeah, they only had trouble with the elevator.
Bo? This is Peep. The AirBnB has a problem.
Are you saying I shouldn't cry 'Wolf Blitzer'?
No, I'm still pretty exhausted.
I though it was a Sleep Disorder clinic...and by my count it's a bit ironic, too.
Little Bo, hey it's Little Jack. Get home. I'm fed up with being the good boy.
Bo Peep, call me back.
Yes, the rally audience has arrived.
No. I'm not taking them to Washington for Melania's Nativity Scene. The girls just got Brazilian shearings for the holidays and as their Shepherd I can't let them anywhere near Frisbee head.  There's no telling what he might grab.
SEND UP A FENCE- I NEED TO GET THESE SHEEP JUMPING SO I CAN GET SOME SLEEP
I heard you sold me a black sheep, which is it?!
I'm not doing anything. Just watching the news.
I'm trying to go to sleep.
I’d like to make a trade for some pork bellies.
Room Service?  Cancel the order for mutton.
No, you won't get your sheep back until you start allowing bathroom breaks.
I'll take the game day special with mushrooms and sausage and a bale of hay on the side.
No, my sheep are 'not in want'!  They have HBO.
I did count!
Wolf! Wolf! ... And since it's on your way, bring up some nachos.
No Mom, I did not get a new job.
The GOP will stop at nothing to build their vote in New York
I told you before: I keep counting but I'm not tired yet!
No, I asked can I get "Veep" in the room? On the TV?
right, two bottles of wine and a video recorder.
I think I'm in baa-d trouble.
Fred? The committee is here and we're ready to go.
Hello, Farm and Fleet?  Do you deliver?
Herding cats is more challenging outdoors.  Not so with sheep.
Maybe working from home isn't the best idea for someone in my profession. I'm being harassed by a bunch of wooly bullies.
It took several trips on the freight elevator but we made it!
I'm working overtime tonight.
My lease says no pets, but I said flock that.
I heard sheparding was the new low stress career choice.
So many sheep, such little time.
I found the sheep but they won’t leave while the Kennel Club competition is on.
I've found your sheep, Miss Bo-Peep.
Editor, please stop presenting last week’s captions to be voted on when the “top three”  for that cartoon have already been chosen.
If tryptophan doesn't knock me out this Thanksgiving, I've got plan B to count on.
As one of a few urban shepherds, I do not want to pull the wool over your eyes but our place has a few unique features
I was on my phone and didn't see where the dog went.
Just my CEO, 20 sales reps and me getting our talking points for today's press conference.
This happens whenever "Collie" reruns air.
You were supposed to be here 5 minutes ago to watch them.
I said I needed a new lamp.
I'm doing Ewe-ber now. It's like shepherding, but for the gig economy.
Are you sure this is the best cure foe insomnia?
Airbnb has really made my business trips more comfortable"
Tell that Bo Peep lady to hurry with the ransom or I'll cut off their tails again.
Yeah, we're all anxiously awaiting the verdict in the Harvard admissions trial.
You'll have to speak up.
Bo-Peep here. Yes, they are home and their tails are behind them.
My share in the farm-to-table market has skyrocketed since I've been leveraging this pied-a-terre.
Sorry, it’s sheep week on The Discovery Channel.
They rang the front door bell.
Hello? Miss. Peep? I think we need to talk.
You'd be amazed how many sheep are lost and found in this town.
I'm feeling a little sheepish
"I told Front Desk that technically they're not pets."
It’s me, Bo Peep. The sheep found me again.
Yo, Little Bo, he's here with me.
The Airbnb's nice, Hamilton was great, but Sheep Meadow was kind of a let down.
Of course I brought the Flock. It just that, I don't know what to do with my self here in NY City.
Been having a hard time falling asleep lately. Any suggestions?
After a breakup I think it's good to sheep around.
Yeah...it surprisingly hasn't helped my insomnia
I don't blame you for dumping her, man. Cat Ladies are unsanitary.
Can one of 'ewe' find the remote?
Don't believe the FAKE NEWS.  I only hire very smart people.
We’re waiting for the midterm election results. They all voted for Donald Duck.
Yes, we're just here at the Baaa-st Western.
...yeah, and don't forget to pick up a case of lint rollers.
...let’s make that thirteen grass bowls.
I've finally gotten the hang of this 'crying wolf' act.
Sorry, but she is not home!!
I started counting sheep and look what happened!
Looks like the flock market is down another 10% today.
I'm watching Silences of the Lambs.  How about ewe?
The dell closed years ago. My wife left me. ...Why should I care that the cheese stands alone.
Ewe V C?  I'd like to cancel an order
Ma’am, I ordered 15 sheep and you only sent 14.
...look Father...I can’t think of anything meaningful and politically correct about gender roles...you see Judas is missing again...I’ll look behind the couch...
No, I have milk, I need ice,
Did you explain to her than I'm a method actor?
Yeah, Mom.  When they say "all the comforts of home" they really weren't kidding.
I found them, They booked an Airbnb in Hell's Kitchen so we are going to grab a show before we leave.
Hello. Is this Bo Peep’s? I need a sitter, today, from 8:30 to 5:30 pm.
I’ve tried counting sheep. But I still can’t get to sleep, and now I’m running out of room.
Is this Miss Peep?  Have I got some tails for you
I've tried counting them, I still can't sleep!
Doc said this prescription means less side effects. And more wool blankets.
...and I got the "Unlimited pet" rate!
We're gonna hang out here until Little Bo finds us.
Having a really baaaaaad time.
But you said "Try counting sheep!"
Yeah, they'll do the 'sleep with a sheep' gig but they want the Netflix password
I don't know, urban sprawl isn't all bad.
Hello ? I want to return my mattress.
The boy who cried, "fake news."
Just counting sheep, how about ewe?
On standby at herdquarters, waiting for the next good shepherd.
The shearing economy is going pretty well for me.
It appears that my PHD in sheep herding is beginning is beginning to pay off.
Sorry, just thinking about work.
No. really,the 27th floor.
Don't worry Ma, Bo-Peep and I are just on a trial separation.
So then my ex told me to 'Get flocked' and...
Sorry but there's a baaaaaad connection.
Surprisingly, everyone sleeps in one bed.
Hello, Amazon? Yes, I beleive there's been a bit of a miscommunication.
Ya I've got 27, but I'll make it 30, cause I rounded them up.
So, I said to her, "Listen, Mabel, you're not the only one who can multitask!"
I shouldn't have let them watch Babe
I’m remote now, the commute was a nightmare.
Settle down, ewes guys, ... PBS News Hour, ... then the Park.
Do you think if I count them I'll fall asleep and they will disappear?
It’s been a lot harder than I imagined to get a career job in this city.
it might be time to move to the suburbs
Yes, Barbara. I know you said I shouldn't bring my work home with me...
I decided that Farmville could be more than just a game.
The WiFi is good but the pasturage could be better.
Ok doctor, I've taken your advice. One, two, three...
Customer service, I can't count for much longer.
Is it just me, or is this phone connection b-a-a-a-d?
You must have left them alone. And they came home, bringing their tails behind them.
Nothin' much--just  keeping an eye on Wall Street.
Unfortunately,I do know where my sheep are.
Hello room service, I'd like a grilled cheese sandwich, heavy on the alfalfa.
Little Bo Peep is missing.
I flocked to the city way before it was a trend with millennials.
If I have anything on other than 24-hour news networks they lose interest.
I cant make it tonight, I got stuck watching my brother-in-laws sheep.
They've made their mind Pete, I'm taking them to the Park tomorrow
Hello, how are ewe?
I’ve decided to home fleece my flock.
I guess this is us.
Yeah that's a large with half pepperoni and half grass.
Where's No. 12? Don't make me stay awake counting....
Sorry, Got to go..."Green Acres" is on.
Mom, I gonna have to think of something, the Landlord isn’t buying “they help me get to sleep."
I'm just glad that we didn't get a wool carpet...
... it wasn’t a dream?
Well, my kid wanted a border collie, so I got her one...
I'm happy with my cable package, but I've got fuzzy reception.
How many in the reservation? Hold on, let me count.
Yes, this is the lady from down the hall.  Come get your damn sheep.”
I found my sheep.  Now I can get a good night's sleep.
Yeah, I couldn't sleep ... how can you tell?
I've never been one to just follow the herd.
Well, NOW I feel sheepish.
I lost count... which one of you is Frank?
It's Shep. I'm too deep in sheep to give you an accurate count. I keep nodding off.
Of course, I thought about AstroTurf, but it gives the little suckers gas!
...a diet coke and...oh ya, 50 pound bag of sheep chow.
I know...but this dream was for real!
There's enough here for a sweater and a scarf.
They're in room 242 at the Plaza, Bo Peep
No, they HAVE to be latex!
The melatonin didn't work but counting the sheep did.
I herd Ewe you the first time
Yes, Sir, I can help you secure the swing vote
I ordered a whirlpool,
NOT a wool pool; but I"ll keep the complimentary shepherd suit
Hey Shaun, I’m not feeling well. Will work from home today.
Hello, Genetics Institute? Can you connect me with your cloning lab?
Little Bopeep has found her sheep!
I'm not sure what it is, but something smells in here.
Yes, thank you, I'd like to finally order the matching shears.
You were right. I just left them alone.
It's the dreams, I can't stop the dreams.
Yeah, we got kicked out of Sheep Meadow by the Frisbee players again.
Yes, you can count on us for a donation.
Yeah, like, the rubber boots they make me wear are ugly but other than that it's, like, way better than babysitting that little brat Liam.
HBO Peep
Bad reception, thought you said lay down and get some sheep.
I told you it was today. All the other dogs are in the lobby. Yes, Champion is here. Yep, I saw Ragtop. Very fit. No, I haven't seen the venue yet... You can't, registration was hours ago. The team? They're okay. They just don't know which way to go.
Dolly, pass the remote would you?
Little Bo Peep? Oh she's out on a business trip and left me with the kids.
No, seriously, Little Bo Peep was nowhere to be found.
So, if I hear you correctly, you're saying I'm still bringing my work home with me?
No, Ms. Peep, I still haven't seen them.
Well they told me they have workplace grievances.   Being an enlightened employer I invited  them up for a civil  discussion.
No, my price is firm -- they're really high quality.
As long as we stay away from Wall Street, you’ll be safe here!
Get the flock out of here ,I can't see the TV
I get that cities are more environmentally friendly with all the public transportation and reduced energy consumption, but I don’t know if this is sustainable for me.
Hello this is 17B, I'm having trouble with my cable.
It’s like living in the clouds.
No, I won't resign from the Co-Op Board.
Where did you deliver those sheers I ordered?
Yes, and could I get a couple side salads thrown in too?
Now you tell me to watch the Weather Channel instead of counting sheep!
They're on to us, Michael. Tell Paul.
If you think a TV, Phone, and Internet bundle is a no-brainier, I have some locally-sourced high-altitude pashminas to tell you about.
There's no Little Bo-Peep here. Stop sending me these things.
Yes, I herd ewe too.
So yeah my pasturr went condo.
So this is Hell.
Hey Joe, they ate all the grass on your roof garden.  Where else can I take them?
It's a nice room, but several other cities submitted better bids for me to bring my job there.
Hi mom, I've got a little problem here, can you keep this just between me and ewes?
I'm telling you, Ethel, people just aren't dreaming like they used to!
Homeland security.  Help I am surrounded by some really baaa’d hombres!
I've been baaaad.
We’re going to stay in tonight, and watch the Wolfman, on TV. What are you doing?
Yeah, I booked it on air-sleepnsheep. Great view!
Oh yes, completely sustainable, as long as you manage their gazing.
I've got to stop watching the Home Sheeping Network.
I haven’t slept for days, and stop telling me to try counting sheep.
The grass is not only not greener—there is none.
I am counting sheep, but still can’t sleep.
I’m into Jazz, long walks on the beach and zoophilia.
You urban-farm tomatoes? That's cute.
Bob? Have you seen Mary?"
We got to talk about the sheep in the room
Yo, Peep.  Tell me how you do it cause I could really use some alone time.
Please cancel my augmented reality subscription.
There was a misunderstanding.  The client only wanted Little Bo Peep.
You must believe me:  I have not a crook! 
And there will never ever be another ewe.
That view doesn't come sheep.
Bo Peep? What kind of a name is that?
When E. F. Mutton talks, sheep'll listen.
I think we were all happier in the show business.
Perchance to dream?
Yes, yes...I am looking for a new apartment in Sheepshead Bay!
Is this the Bo Peep residence? I'd like to have a word
It was a herd day, so I'm just going to stay in and watch baa-d TV.
Merry Christmas to you."
"And Merry Christmas to you, and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe and ewe . . ."
You are not going to believe this, Bo-Peep!
Eleven supreme pizzas, one with gluten-free crust and extra pepperoni.
Are you accusing me of being sheepish?
Get me Litte Bo Peep!
Sorry, Bo Peep, they said they're not going to follow you like sheep.
You've got crooks over there, too?
Hello. Miss Bopeep please
I can't hang out tonight,actually. I told my coworker I'd watch his sheep.
No,no. This is quite adequate.But just to be on the safe side, please send up a bottle of Ambient.
Ewe'll never believe where I am
My follow-up memoir is tentatively titled: "Little Bo Peep Can't Sell Her Freeloading Sheep."
I think I did this whole "counting sheep" thing wrong.
The move's been easy.  All the kids in Brooklyn think I'm a hipster.
I think I need to decide to embrace either technologie’s convenience or the 
Simple Agrarian lifestyle
Didn't work, Dave. Her? She's in her bedroom. Crying. Yeah. Nah, that she's wide awake. . . . I agree. It's not funny. Her cartoon's due at 11:00, sharp! And she's got bupkis. . . . Sure, I'll tell her what you said. Draw me and the sheep.
I’m feeling kind of baaaa!
Yes, Mr. Shepherd? I think I have your stick.
I don't think they herd me properly
When I'm calling ewe...
They've finished the broadloom. Now what?
Come on! Not even one night off?
Room service, can I get 12 orders of  freshly cut grass and a cold glass of milk please?
Come in quiet, I plan on being asleep.
Counting sheep, my ass. I'm still awake.
Tom Wolfe calling, is Mary home?
NO, NO, I said sheep!S-H-E-E-P.
Jesus, you are not going to believe this...
No, I won't need utensils.
Actually, the director wants to cast it as a sequel to the Urban Cowboy.
When do you get back again, Mary? You sure weren’t kidding when you said everywhere you went the lambs were sure to go!
Wake up!
Netflix has Silence of the Lambs in 4K.
I spent all morning looking for grass. What do *you* suggest?
Yes, the apartment faces Sheep Meadow in Central Park and pets are definately allowed.
I think I took a wrong turn somewhere
Room Service
I'd like 100 lbs of carrots
100 lbs onions
And a six pack of Dos XX amber for me
Can you be more specific?
2973,2974,2975...
Yes, I've returned to the fold.
But sir, they aren't pets, per se.
I was only counting them, not calling them!
I somehow still see myself as a black sheep
Hello, is this Little Bo-Peep?
I have just the guy, a real nose for grass, will follow you anywhere, blends in with the herd. He has even put a few out to pasture if you get my meaning.
Where’s my border collie? You walked him more than three hours ago, I’m nodding off, and they’re getting edgy.
I can't come out I'm pet sitting...ya she said it was just a little lamb but it's way more
Can you please call  back? I'm watching "The Good Shepherd".
I just followed the herd.
Honey, you said you wouldn't be back until Tuesday.
Last week it was pink elephants.
Nothing much, just the same old same, what's up with you?
I do house sitting on the side, I'd never quit my day job.
Hello, Serta?  Weren't you supposed to be here a week ago?
We are all flocked up here.
No, they are not helping me fall asleep.
Yeap, Central Park is fine.
So you're saying that when I keep yelling I'm a man needing  REM sleep they thought I said I had a Ram needing them sheep?
You wanted me to bring home bacon???
Yeah, I'm over here in Brooklyn. The super said ewes could stay all night.
Yeah, I’d like 15 lemon grass soups, 300 spring rolls, 100 pounds of your fermented cabbage. Thanks.
Yes - I took the organic approach to curing my insomnia. Any other suggestions?
I didn't see no Star of Bethlehem.
My name is Mary. I want to report a dog missing.
Did you say YOU're feeling a little sheepish?
Mitch here, I’m caucusing with my Senate Committee Chair colleagues right now; I’ll let you know which way to vote later!”
So you're telling me this pillow will solve all my problems?
Hello? Yes, this is the lonely shepherd looking for his Bo Peep.
The room is nice, but I lost Mitzi in Central Park.
C’mon over. The gang’s all here.
Yes, grazing is quite the rage now.
We’re on a break.
Because, it's a jungle out there!
The New Yorker wants me to be in this cartoon, but I know the caption's going to be the worst, stupidest low-hanging fruit joke ever.
Hello, Grubhub?
Yes? Four kids on sugar? We´re coming!
I've counted then at least three times, and I still can't get to sleep . . .
now remember we are only here for the weekend
Hurry!  We need to get the flock out of here!
You really don't have daily carpet cleaning service available?
I appreciate the fact-checking. Yup, lost. Yup, left them alone. Yup, bringing tails.  It's all true.
Yes, I’d like to order the Olympic hurdle jumping channel.
They get really antsy during the commercials.
Whadda ya mean, “imagine counting sheep ...”?
Hey, Bo Peep.  You having trouble sleeping as well?
All I can tell you is that all the grazing land is being used by someone named Amazon.
It’s a business write off.
Yeah, but I'm not ready for bed yet.
Yes, one dozen matcha wheatgrass cappuccinos with oat milk. Thanks.
Mary, it's simply not true.  I do not have the tendency to go overboard with my gifts!
That's not funny. A Scotsman with a lot of girlfriends is not called a shepherd.
So, what are ewe up to?
Well, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I said  I wanted to stay at Trump Towers.
How can I produce refined wool when they always run past Broadway and go to Central Park?
You won't believe this but they love Monday night football!
Security? I suspect there’s a wolf in my room.
I would have invited you, but you don’t have a woolly coat.”

Do you have a Bo Peep costume?
Just one pair of chopsticks.
Hey Marvin, the girls are here already, so where the bleep are you?
Sorry. What did I say to make you think I was a pastor?
Yes, we're all watching the rally, but they're having a hard time understanding why all those humans in the background with the red caps on are so fawning and compliant.
It's really a no brainer; Sheep's Meadow after curfew or a group rate at the Pierre.
I don't know how it happened. I was just watching a rerun of Lassie.

But I’ve never vacuumed before.
...Nothing, just watching the game with a 12 pack of ewes.
Now that Halloween is over, what do I do with them?
What will I do? Dunno. Count sheep, I guess.
I just wanted to get on the grid.
It's kind of a baaaaad time to come over.
Netflix original, Sheep in the City, finds its niche demographic.
They followed me home from Sheep Meadow.
In about a month we’ll be moving to higher ground.
Now I'm really flocked.
No one gives a shepherd a pension.We never retire.
Stand still so I can count you. I just want to fall asleep.
I can do three bags times a hundred....but were outta black.  Sorry.  Check Amazon.
I guess you could say I am polyamorous...in a way.
Where is Little Bo Peep?
I should run for office.
It all started when I upgraded to the premium package...
I was dreaming and then this........
You've reached Bo-Peep's Sheep Herding Service.  Bo, speaking.
WHAT, humbug?
Hamilton tickets were too expensive so we're just going to hang out at the Sheep Meadow.
Trying to decide one for my sofa wool cover

When I developed hay-fever the union argued they had a duty to accommodate, so here we are.

Thank ewe.
They love watching their better half LA Rams on TV.

You say, "Leave them alone and they will come home?"
At least he didn't call me "Lyin''" or "Crooked"
We put them to field, then we put them to couch--that's how it works, Greg.
What if you don't have a nice green lawn?
I had a choice but I didn't think cows would work out as well.
Now listen carefully -I''ll try it once more - If I had thirty sick sheep and two of them died how many would I have left.
It worked wonders yesterday, but tonight I think there's one missing"
i can only get one of them on my couch, what is the problem?
Her family is fixing to leave.
I’m thinking the pills worked better, Doc. Thank

Another down side to sharing the President's last name. They've been following me ever since.
I forgot the key to the barn!
Hello Mrs. Peep... we were hot on 'Little Bo's tail until she reached the subway.
We're awaiting a shipment of grass from Colorado
Hello, Border Collie Rescue? ... No, no. I’m the one who needs to be rescued!

It's polartec with free shipping, right?
Yes, Poopsie, I know.  I can’t find them.  You know I’ll keep looking.  How’s your momma?
Yes, used the fright elevator.
The President says you're bred to vote only in Red States .
Quiet! I can’t count and listen at the same time.
It's pretty cozy watching TV together. But lining them all up in the elevator gets tricky.
No...not Ambien!
...then I woke up with all these sheep in the apartment.
I know, getting them up elevator was torture!
What do you mean you changed your plans, Little Bo Peep?"
The sheep are alright.

What do you mean, 'wrong number'?
I am not the black sheep
For a comfy sleep-in, come to Sheeps-Inn Bay!

They brought their tails behind them, sure, but evidently they couldn't be bothered to pick up a gallon of milk.
I want to legally change my name to Joseph
Yeah, you're right working from home is great for some people, but I am beginning to think that it isn't that great for us shepards.

Look, the goal is to get them fat, right?
Fox News Again

I'm afraid we've lost Mary.

How many sheep?" "If I count, I might fall asleep"
Renting them for the day was actually cheaper than having the shag carpet removed.
I just came back from a quiet restful time in the country.
I sleep better than ever.
No, mate, Croc is still on walkabout. I'm his brother Sheep Dundee.
Okay. If I can find somebody to watch over them, I'' be there.

It sounds great in theory, but my team won't leave me alone so I may as well be in the office.

Good work, Alfie - now fetch the remote!
Sheep folds" are so last century and this helps with my insomnia
I'm sorry to tell you that it's sheep all the way down.
What's new with ewe guys?
Yeah, this isn't quite what I had in mind when they said that I could work from home at my new job at the urban vertical farming start-up.
I think they'll see that the grass is not always greener outside the meadow."
Yes, hello, I was wondering if you know anyone who would be willing to babysit my 12 children
Our visit to New York is doin' jes fine Clem, why we gots TV even.
No, No, No!  My name is J-E-S-S-I-E ... Not J-E-S-U-S !
They were suppose to be house trained.
Not a bhaaaaad view either!
I ordered one space heater.
Working from home is becoming a real Baaaa-ttle.
What? No heath insurance for jumpin fences at night
That's Mrs. Peep to you.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before. Shepherding is a heck of a lot easier, but where's the remote?
I guess in this version of the fairy tale, the sheep find Little Bo Peep!
No - I'm not just phoning it in.
I’ll have three large Pizzas with extra Manchego.
don't forget to bring the Ambien, Little Bo Peep
Thank you.  It would be a shear pleasure.
Let me speak to Bow.
Hello, Bo Peep?  I found your sheep
..correct ma'am, I'm a surrealist artist.. no, I'm fully awake..
This time next week, I'll be the next Calvin Klein. I'm counting on it.
I don't know what happened.  All I could hear was the sound of some guy snoring.
You got the wrong number, my name is not Mary.
Come out of the closet, Mary.  I know you're in there!
Don't worry Mom, I'm still herding sheep.
I’m just vegging, I have to get the flock out of here.
Look, I know I'm a professional sheepherder, but I can only fit so many in the closet!
Hello H&M? I would like to complain about your new wool collection...
Ham and cheese on rye, four bales of hay,and a bucket of sheep dip
I already took you for a walk. Now I'm calling Room Service for supper.
I'm feeling a little sheepish about watching the daytime soaps.
311, I'd like to report a case of this damn New Yorker artist has like every comic being a guy on a cellphone now.
I can't count this high!
Looks like I lost the GPS signal on a few, back to manual counting tonight
I didn't think this transfer thing out very well.
Hello, Herder? I'd like to book a walk for Thursday afternoon.
What do you mean when you say "You don't fit in"?
It's a new OSHA rule: spot a wolf, and you have to shut down operations."
Baaa-Humbug, let me speak to your supervisor.
It’s shear madness! Apparently a Miss Bopeep checked in last week, went to the theatre, then just vanished.
Yeah, I’m home waiting to hear back.  Herd anything?
These sheeps have sailed.
Housekeeping? I think I'll go back to counting the bedbugs.
I guess outdoors it's harder to smell you.
No, no, there's plenty of space, but I could use 
help with the walking.
We either binge watch or get lost!
The special is leg of lamb? No...I'll pass. I'll have the lasagne.
Ba ba ... darn, where is blackie?
You've always been a glutten for mutten
I'm trying to reach Little Bo-Peep.
If you're waiting for my words of wisdom, don't hold your breath.
Yes, that's 15 guests and we'd better go with the chicken.
Can I do another poll? Sure; what's the topic?
Little Bo Peep said she'd be here
Yes, all of our fleeces are made with premium Hell’s Kitchen wool.
Our television is only getting the food network.
This is Ms Bo Peep; a dozen salads, dressing on the side.
I’m in Vegas, but the sheep have to stay.
Us? Oh, fine. How youse doin?
Nothing much just watching another episode of  the   Bo Peep chronicles.
Where are Mary and her lamb when I need her?
A captive audience...
Yea I just got in! Yup, alive and wool
In a pasture? What's a pasture?
Imprint, schrimpret,! I just couldn't shake 'em.
Could you send up some NyQuil, please.
Has anyone reported some missing sheep?
...for delivery, yes, one order of shepherd’s pie. Uh, is that pasture-raised?
Yeah, I need some grass. An ounce of premium for myself and two bales of yard grass that you cut with your mower on weekends for my kids... What do you mean ‘that’s cold’?
Ok so I ordered the sheep online and now all I have to do is count them to get some sleep?
Little Bo Peep, please get these damn sheep out of my living room.!
No firewood this week, Silas.I'm house-sitting for my cousin.
Wearing a wool sweater is one things, but ordering lamb chops at dinner is so ewe.
I heard you used to herd ewes too?
I went in-house.
I call it "Urban Small".
Not much. Just watching a quick DIY on YouTube before we get started.
They get mad when I watch ahead without them.
Just hanging out, they wanted to catch this Baaaallywood  matinee.
There's a better view here, but not all of the flock are happy.
The deal was that I bring them to the city.  You just need to count them, and then we can all sleep well.
My true love gave to me
13 sheep a watching!
I just formed the “Baa Too Movement”!
My flock's taking advantage of me

Not bad but they don't play well with others.
I am finding that the higher the floor, the more wolves there are at the door.
I'm calling the franchise "sofa Sheep."  Think Goat-yoga for lazy people.
Even on vacation, this cell phone keeps me tethered to my work.
Bo was a no-show.
What do you mean my calls have been barred?
Hello, Bo...can you get over here, quick
Don't transfer my call to Wolfe. I've called Wolfe four times already. No one answers.
Mhmm... mhmm... No way!! Get the flock out of here!
I’ve always been the black sheep in my family!
But I reserved the family suite."
Me sheepish? You're a baaaad person
Hold on. We'll pick up the mail, see what's on the weather channel and be on our way.
I misunderstood when you said the dog was afraid of crooks.
We’re hungry! What time is the reservation for?
Hello, Room Service? I'm afraid we're out of grass again. Could you please load the elevator just one more time and send it up to Room 517?
Yes, it's become quite obvious that I mis-herd!
At least this place is rent controlled
Despite appearances, these sheep shall not want.
I just arrived in town for shearing so have your sheeple call mine to schedule a time.
They're like a cult. They're waiting to hear the next vicious thing he says.

All I can say right now is that we're having a certain kind of 'chops.'
I don't have room for a dozen goats.....anymore.
Yeah mom the interview went well. I'm pretty hopeful, they said the other candidates were pretty sheepish...
That was before I joined the back from the land movement.
I'm Mr. Big and it's called "Shepherd and the City"
Hay, have you herd the latest ewes from Wool Street?
Baaah dude, I can't go out tonight, I have to get started making my Christmas Sweaters
Everyone's fine...no, I said bleating...with a "t".
I  need a wake up call for 7:30 AM sharp.
I merely mentioned take them for some R&R by the shore, not to come back seeing themselves being shorn.
''you say his name is Jesus Christ? Yes I'm open,where is it? Follow the North star?....''
I'll bring them down once we get the first frost.
Quit you're bleating. I'm ordering 'The Wolf of Wall Street' right now.
I'm watching the Weather Channel now, there's still a chance it might rain.
Hello, Take me back. The time machine screwed up. There is no grass, no trees, and strange people in a thin box.
Wide Awake, and what di I do with the Sheep?
Animal Control? Little Bo Peep here. The 12 sheep in my living room are not MY sheep. Send someone over quick.
Barking doesn’t help—go look in the park.
It’s not my fault you were drunk when you said “Some sheep, some sheep, my kingdom for some sheep.”
His press conference is about to begin, and I'm ready for you to prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
I’ll trade sheep for ore.
Hello, this is ewe-ber.  We offer the 'sheepest' fares!
Gene Wilder was underrated as an actor.
Hey! I told you guys, I leave work at work!
I know they're happy to see me, but I was hoping they'd wag their tails behind them.
Okay, so Its the greenline north and he'll be at the holiday inn?
I'm definitely not the good shepherd.  I'm still missing 85 of 100.
Bo knows.
Yeah, we got kicked out again . . . they ought to just call it Blanket Meadow, or Wasted Grass Meadow . . . .
Yeah, except for all the reruns on the Sheepdog Channel, it's a pretty good gig.
We pride ourselves on PETA  approved fibres in our  knitted goods.
This show about a man living with is goats is not very believable, huh Girls!
Oh, I'm OK, just havin' a few friends over.
I wonder how they got up the the elevator
I am really struggling settling into this new urban lifestyle ... but binge-watching is great.
Things have gone from baah to worse.
Hello, Mr. Shearer? This is Mary. I quit.
It's true, there's like 20 Greek restaurants in SoHo alone...
Yeah, I like the Federal Government's solution to wool tariffs as well.
Yeah, sorry, I'm taking a sabbatical.
We got here on a NIMBY grant!
I ordered your lamb crock for lunch, not your flock!
I would like to invest $500 in wool.
Hello room service,could you send up a little lamb?
... Yes? Is this Aesops Fables Animation Inc.? Yes, I'd like to complain about 'The boy who cried wolf'. My nose is NOT that big!
Hey Bob I need the dial-in I’m WFH today
They were all out of those sheep skin blankets so I thought I'd opt for the real thing.
No MSG in anything... we’re strictly organic.
sorry sir but i'm on break and they follow me wherever I go. I guess the wolf haunted then forever.
Most recently I'm doing research for a tv spin-off/re-imagining, "The Good Life: NYC" which is going well. We've found that the sheep absolutely love wool carpeting.
I know I'm asking for more, 'Lil Bo Peep, but I've assumed more overhead. This is my final offer, $500. per head or things are going to turn very baad.
Baa What? Baa What? Baa What? Baa...
I would bring them back, but they can't stand the greyhound.
Hello Shaun?  The movie you made about my life is weird, if you ask me
We're binge-watching Black Sheep Squadron.
Still no sign of their tails, but there’s a terrific view of the East River.
I'm missing a sheep, can you look in your kitchen?
I really wish my parents  haven’t called me BoPeep
Are ewe sure about that?
Hello, is this Sheep Dog R-Us?
Ewe have to be kidding.
I can't afford separate apartments in Manhattan.
Bad news, Bo. Little Henry has left the building.
Rammed. Yeah.
I've seen 'Babe' like a hundred times already.
Hello, Gotham Sheep Walkers?
Watching over his flock
They was to watch ‘Lassie’ again.
I know!  Amazon has taken so much space that everyone is staying at my place now.
They could care less about Animal Planet.
I'm beginning to prefer this to our pastoral paradise.
Oh, about two to three.
Hey guys, it’s the concierge... he says some FBI agent in the next room is trying to get to sleep and you gotta shut the hell up...
I'm still dreaming1  I woke up too soon
Yes mom, I am counting sheep but something is different here in the penthouse compared to the farmhouse.
They all wanted to move on to grayer pastures.
Little Bo Pooped-Out
Oh, mutton much. I have city sheep in my new apartment so I want to invite ewes to take a nap with me.
They're all flocking to the TV.
Hey, the code you told me that gets them to disappear isn't working.
I don't see why 'sheeple' should be a term of abuse.
The sheep and I have a concern, and we'll need your assurance. If we continue working for you, we'll need health insurance.
No, Bo-Peep, you're the one who is lost.  Haven't you figured out GPS yet?
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I’m going to be working from home today. ... No, that's okay; I’ve got a little bag of that absorbent stuff.
Yep, found the staff.   But where do you keep the sheepie-bags?
...it's Sheep Meadow, not Sheeps Meadow!
They also love pumpkin spice.
I just love that President Trump is helping out the little guy.
I’d like to report a missing person --- Mrs Black sheep
Sorry boss... the metro is on strike again.
Yeah, I’ve herd that before...
Finally got my own baachelor pad.
I'm herding some colleagues to watch the game.
If lamb on the hoof is at an all time high these pets are going to market.
Yes, this is Owen. My sheep will be without a sheppard during my cruise to the Bahamas.
THAT'S  SHEPHERD/S H E P H E R D.
My new harem is awesome, except for the carpet stains.
Little Bo Peep
didn’t exactly lose the sheep,
silly to think him so naive;
No, he’s living quite well
with so many to sell
especially for Christmas Eve.
Just hanging out watching Sheep Week.
You can’t just leave them alone and expect them to wag their tails back home to you.
It's easier now. They just want to watch Shep Smith on Fox.
There's a concert at the Sheepmeadow.
I said, “the missing person is a sheep herder not a head hunter.”
The Marino wool sweater runs “a little large.”
Animal control, what the flock do I do with these sheep?
Is this the Sheep Meadow?
I know the cleaning deposit is high but it'll pay for itself in . . . It'll never pay for itself.  So, can I put you down for a v-neck.
Milk is just a squeeze away.
Not much, just watching some ewes.
It would best be described as ennui.
Safe in The City. And yes Mom, I’m still a virgin. My little lamb, however, has been quite fruitful ...
Hey! I count only ninety and nine here, Dad. What d'ya want me to do?
Hello, Dogs R Us?

Is there an instruction booklet?
Hey mom, that trick you taught me is not working.
Ok!Ok!  I’ll turn on the Discovery Chanel
Hey Little Bo Peep, I've found your sheep.
 Wanna watch Netflix and chill?
I watch television to bolster my herd mentality
They miss Shaun.
Ram, Cordero! Wool ewe mutton it? I'm loin out on a lamb here! Shear, ewe herd I like sheep thrills, shank ewe; butt I don't like ewe to rib me or pull my leg. Make the breast of it, keep rack, rump through the hoops & chop to it. To neck with ewe!
Well I'm present. The sheep are present. But Bret and Jemaine aren't present. Typical.
The HD TV is great, but I can’t get the wool out of my eyes.
So I guess I'm the only one voting for the other guy
Where is that damn Mary? I'm tired of baaaaaby sitting.
I met this girl online, we went to dinner, I had the lobster bisque, ba-ba-ba, I never heard from her again.
I found my sheep. They’re in my rent-controlled apartment.
Hello?  I'd like to return my Halloween costume.  You said it would be over the top, but you didn't mention livestock.
Netflix and chill, am I using that right?
Not much, I'm just getting ready to make about 20 wool fleeces.
You know what? 99 out of 100 is pretty darn good.
Guys how long should I watch this thing before I become one you
But, really....can I count on you?
Could you send up a few thousand tin cans, please?
The day hipsterism jumped the shark
No, I didn't steal your truck. I called Uber. Just give me a raise, plus cable TV in the farm, then I will give you them back.
All alone, I'm as honest as they come. But ewes bring out the crook in me.
This is Mr. Bo Peep. Will I do?
Stop bugging me with the hahing I'll walk you at half time!
So when exactly is that pasture I ordered coming?
Hello Apple, yeah, my friends and I were wondering when the new iPhone is going to be released?"
This thing leads sheep better than I ever could.
I'm not watching T.V., those are my sheep....SHEEP...I AM home.
Hello Lamb-Service?
I've got a room for poor little lambs who have lost their way,baa,baa,baa . . . . .
Sorrry Dorothy, I won’t be coming back to Kansas until your Auntie Em promises to change the channel on the TV from Fox News. The sheep can’t take any more.
Hello?  Gambolers Anonymous?
Keep it down, I want to get my security deposit back.
Easily entertained?  What?!  They're MILLENIALS!!  I take ‘em to see Jeff Koontz’s fuschsia sheep.  Baaaad!  To Damien Hirst’s Lamb in Formaldehyde! Baaad! Even to the pop-up pasture in Chelsea!  Baaad! ALL they want is to pose for the Haas Brothers!
Keep it down guys, so the co-op board doesn't find out.
It's the only job I could find where I could watch my shows on the job.
Laurance, can you come over and take my 12 sheep out for a walk? They need to pee, but I dont want to get my hair wet.
I turned Vegan and I didn't know what else to do.
No, I didn't say, "Chill and Netflocks."
grrr...where is that irresponsible Little Bo Peep???
Hey, guys, I was almost asleep when someone's phone went off.
I've made it.
You are so flocking right!
I’ve been counting on you to handle this!
I know you're busy with the cow.  Just grab your horn and get over here, Blue!
Wow!  A lot has happened since our last vacation!
They're not responding to the wolf channel.
We got an airbnb.
I'm might feel a little sheepish about asking for my security deposit back.
Yeah, I'm not feeling well, so I'll be out today. I hope to be in tomorrow, though.
Really, I was just watching "All Things Great and Small"
I don't mind houses sitting, but only baaasic cable?
No, the border collie said he didn't need to go outside for the bathroom.
Mary you swore that wether who attended the last sleep over was fixed.
Concierge?  Can you arrange transportation for us to the Sheep Meadow?
Wait, you said COUNTING sheep would help me sleep?
Yes, I still thing Wall Street needs a shepherd.
They all have a clover allergy.
My rod and My Sta-ah-ah-ah-aph, they comfort me.
YOU CAN ALSO RELAX BY SITTING DOWN ON GROUND
Could you pick me up? They say I'm not welcome here.
I found the sheep but I lost Bo peep
Maybe for you it's counting sheep, for me it's Netflix and chill.
I was going to make my wife a sweater for Christmas, but I think I'll give her the flock of sheep instead.
Every time I get fleeced on Internet trading, another one shows up.
I wonder how many I have to count to fall asleep
Does that come with a side order of hay and alfalfa?
The hotel was threatening to kick me out because I have a crook in the room, so they're not likely to be happy when they discover the sheep.
‘The hotel policy permits comfort animals and whatmis more comforting than a flock of sheep?’
I never should have tuned into Fox News.
My cables out !
So. what's ewe with you?
Ewe have to be kidding me!  This is so baaaaaad!
Say, George, just how curious are you?
I think they mistook me for Shaun
You millennials ain't jumpin like your folks did.
In these new digs, I can definitely lose the crook.
The doctor suggest I count sheep in order to get to sleep.
Those sheep work better then my last sleeping pills, my naturopath was right.
Yes, we are gentrifying it to become Flock Tower.
I said Sheep dog, not Sushi!
We object to your reporter's use of the term "sheeple."
yeah it's pretty sweet but not, like, perfect? they saw me making mutton yesterday and i'm fairly certain that they're planning armed revolution. on the plus side, i'll never run out of mutton. this is a metaphor for colonialism.
Room service, this is Mr. Wilder in Room 315...
You won’t believe what’s happening in Long Island City
I think I just did "lucid dreaming" one step better.
I'm here for the sheep herders convention, could you send up about ten litter boxes.
Bad news, Honey, the condo bylaws allow dogs.
What was that? I may have herd you wrong.
Shaun, calling because I was sheepish of what to do and Ewe you would know.
Room Service? Yeah, I've finally decided.  Hold the mint jelly, send up silage.
Turns out there's still no wall and I can't have them just running loose
...and I'm telling YOU that there's nothing weird about it AT ALL!
Remember that pillow business I was talking about? You can still get in.
I'm bleating just fine, mom.
At least in here you’ll never have to hear me cry “wolf!
I’m calling to report a sheep disturbance.
I hope it’s Just a baaaad dream.
No worries . Soros is going to pay for the room.
They love the show, Marty. They're sending you high fives.
'Thanks, Bo Peep, I'll  fall asleep tonight for sure!"
No, Bo-Peep is getting her hair shorn.
i need some sheep ... I mean sleep
What was that? Sorry, I can't hear ewe.
That’s right. Five hundred buck and they come home - wagging their tails behind them.
I thought changing my name from Mary to Bo Peep would help get rid of them, but they've come back tenfold!
I was just counting, I wasn't calling
My new job is a piece of cake.
I feel a little sheepish... but I lost count
They call it the 21st century. It’s great I know right!
Y'know that bet? I bl-ewe it.
I just herd them to the nearest “Silence of the Lambs.”
Always a good shepherd, never a great shepherd.
We're watching the Real Sheep of New York City, yeah, just like sheep.
Mom,which one is the Food channel??
A lamb friendly hotel, and no forbs. You're serious.
I can herd you now.
My apartment smells like ass.
I thought it would be a tough transition at first, but this college admissions thing is kind of the same gig.
They say she has A little lamb.    

I don't know if that's true.
“I’m sitting here in my bully wool-pit, with a flock of potential new voters.”
Something with a small yard and, perhaps, a wedding chapel.
All the seasonal fuss has induced a b-a-a-a humbug mood .
Hi Friends; I am counting on you....
Room service? Some surf and turf please.
Don’t know if we can do city living.
Bo Peep, could you come home from Lady’s Night a little early? The kids are hungry.
I'm a sheep herder on the 14th Floor of Trump Tower. Life is not baa-aa-aa-ad.
Oh! I heard "high RISE" pasture.
Tell Moses he picked a hell of a day to call in sick.
Make that fresh, organic greens with sheep dip on the side.
Yeah, I just watched the Rams go down ...
I guess its new urbanism
Room service? I ordered shephard's PIE.
But I ordered a flock of seagulls.
Hey, Doc. So, last session you said I could beat this problem of  bringing my work home with me. May I quickly clarify some specifics"
No wolves, only corgis.
Hello, housekeeping? There's sheep everywhere in my apartment!
Just to be sure, I again watched this PETA video.  I was right. One night a week at a motel works best.
Hello Freud, am I the crazy sheep man ?
Some of their tails are behind them, Bo-Peep, but it’s a bloodbath in the subway.
You're right. A border collie never had a chance. See you when you get back from the show.
Coincidently, I see that Trump is taking it on the lamb.
It’s pronounced “hoo-guh”.
Apparently I was the perfect person for this job.
Tell them to all come home!
it brings me nearer to heaven
The sheep are ready.  Send in the knitters.
Ma, they're makin' eye at me!
The reception's okay, but I can't hear a thing.
Mostly, what I do is keep them out of the china closet.
One more peep outta ya, and I'll get my staff around your neck...
Bo Peep's Lost & Found reward was too good to pass up.
Ok, who wants to sing the Whiffenpoof Song?
Is Ms. Bo-Peep there?
That's right, the flock charges double for Sunday nights. Our count comes with limitless bleat-free runs and a complimentary blanket.
Hey Jacob, Ewe-VC TV is running another BOGO deal!
Sure, it's a little less space than we are used to but I get much faster internet speeds for streaming.
It must be my new after shave.
Oh yeah, they LOVE city life. The get only the best hair and makeup at Radio City.
Just Like Sheep-They All Followed Me Home
I hear they have 2 new uses for sheep.

Meat and wool.
Behave and I won’t become contrary
Could you please stop calling me the black sheep of the family?
“Yeah, yeah, I herded all about it.”
We just got back from Sheep Meadow and guess what's on...the
Whiffenpoofs!
Are  you  sure  you  got  the right  number,
I'm  house-sitting a  flock of sheeps!
Many a ewe has beeb herded  ,but only  few of ewe will be chosen.
This was supposed to be a sheep building but a wolf just moved into the place across the hall.
Well, I’ve taken some time off to develop my sheep-sharing app...
I'm starting to think my flock is unrepresentative.
Hi, yes, IKEA? I have some complaints about your new wool sweater line.
Maybe I shouldn't have used wayz.
You want me to risk them all and go after that one lost sheep?
We're taking a short break to watch Shaun the Sheep.
I guess it's free floating anxiety.
They just need some space for a little while.
Come over the orgy’s about to start.
Just watching the game, waiting to see who’s going to be the goat.
Airbnb, Bo Peep! Beats sleeping in the field, and this one even has Netflix!
Bring us a bottle of your finest milk
They’re reporting he was just a wolf in sheep’s clothing all along.
Hello, Orkin?
Just hangin'.  What's up over at Cow Shed apartment?
I can't do it all. You know the kind of sheep around me.
So how do you know her?
Yes, I found a way to keep them safe and I order all their food from Amazon
You forgot to mention the pied-a-terre Lil' Bo!
Yes, I left them alone, and yes, I know that nursery rhyme. But that only applies to Little Bo Peep.
This was supposed to be my day off
They said if I'd leave them alone but geez, this isn't even my pad!
I'm watching Countryfile in surround sound.
Somewhere Itook a wrong turn.
I tell you, some people take the Bible too literally these days. Marcy's just left me with ninety-nine sheep and has gone out searching for the one that's lost.
Yeah, um, looks like the sermon will have to be cancelled today.
Hi, it's Bo Peep. I've found my sheep.
Hello, Bo-Peep? I’ve got something you want...
Have you ever tried to house-train a black sheep?
Got your new order of Ugg Boots, straight from Australia.
I think we're going to stay awhile.
But they want streaming pastures.
It was my brother in law idea, he said lamb commodities were a slam dunk!
No,Mort,I'm telling' ya....I put up the banner, the whole herd and I went to the rallies, it's even my new profile pic.  There's still no sign of him.
Thanks guys but I STILL can't get to sleep and now it's time to get up!
Had to change my profile page. ‘Shepherdess’ is needlessly gendered or something.
Well, at least there are no wolves here!
I was thing of just heating up the shepherd's pie if that's okay with you.
Congrats on the agility win, Cookie, but we need you back here before sundown.
I see what you mean about Binge Watching!
'Then i woke up in an office with this crazy get up and all these sheep milling around'
Yep, that's what I said,  they just haven't perfected GPS yet.
Hi Susan, Ewe won’t believe this...
Yeah, they herd the phone ring.
I know he's well behaved, but I can't fit any more sheep in the elevator.
Can you pick up a pizza on your way home?
You’re telling me I traded half of my sheep for this apartment?!
I think I manifested the wrong dream.
Apologies for missing the Sleep Number gig. I've laid up.
OK, for the last time, who is going to make me a blanket?
They told me there'd be a babe in a manger, but the only thing here is a picture of a burning log.
No, I did not hear the angels sing; I am working from home.
Yes darling of course, I know a thing or two about being sheepish. Just ask her out!"

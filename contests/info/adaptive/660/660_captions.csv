Tell the boss I'm working from the branch office today.
I'm the new branch manager.
So you got my tweet.
Are you here about the sublet?
I got rid of everything that didn’t bring me joy.
When he's no longer president.
Well, well, well, if it isn’t my old accountant Jim who said I’d never afford a view of Central Park.
They made me a branch manager.
I come here to brood.
I began tweeting ... and one thing led to another.
My 23 And Me results came back and I'm 8% Pigeon.
Does this hat make me look silly?
We’re registered at Bird Bath & Beyond.
It's just until I pay down my student loans.
It's illegal to sleep on the bench.
I call it my branch office.
I'd sit on the far side of the bench if I were you.
I call it TRUNK TOWER.
Prewar, park views, hardwood, no pets, birds ok.
One Central Park Nest.
“ I had a plan after college, but then my parents moved in with their parents.”
No,not full-time. I have a dog sitting gig during the week.
I found a way to live on my Social Security!
You're gonna have to speak to the branch manager.
You may now approach the bench.
Yes, I have two kids in college, how did you know?
No, no, I'm just housesitting—the owners go south every winter.
Corporate offered me a branch office position.
The AirBnB listing said, "Loft in the city, completely furnished, great park view, owners away south for the winter".
Are you here about the 'Cozy loft with park-view?'
All they know is that I live in a high rise on Park Avenue.
I wouldn't sit there, bud.
I came to rescue a cat and then realized, "Hey! This isn't so bad!"
Relax- they're not yours.
Who's homeless now, Gary?
It's comfortable enough, and now I can afford my health insurance premiums.
The ad said “Rent controlled with a birds eye view of Central Park West.”
It just made sense considering how much I tweet
It was this or move to Jersey.
You and Mom never believed I'd be living on Central Park West.
The good news is I moved out of my parents' place.
Are you the new branch manager?
As a millennial, this is pretty much my only hope for building a nest egg.
Did you get my tweet?
My ex-boss has lunch on that bench everyday. I'm just waiting for him.
The ad said perfect for an empty nester seeking Central Park views and low utility costs.
It's just until the Airbnb couple leave my bedroom.
It's a great place to meet chicks.
Why stop at just destroying their habitat?
Go ahead and have a seat sir.  What's the worst that could happen?
It's the same rent as our apartment in Soho, but with more room.
I'm the sitter, may I take a message?
This is where I do my tweets.
The listing said, "cozy loft with a view of Central Park."
No, I'm just house sitting. The owners went south for the winter.
And people are finally paying attention to my tweets.
You can't beat the price, and only one flight up.
Tweeting has a whole new meaning.

I’ll send you a tweet.
Guess who just got laid.
Can you believe the owners just up and left?
I just got promoted to branch manager.
cheap, cheap, cheap
The ad just said: "cheap cheap cheap!"
I got it for a song.
... and after getting my master's in communications, I moved into this tree.
Are you here to set up the WiFi?
I picked it up for a song.
My rent is peanuts. I sublet from a squirrel
My tweets feel more authentic now.
Mary, you do realize that “building a nest together” was a metaphor.
Got tired of working from home so I opened a branch office.
Any minute now you're gonna ask me if this is my branch office -I can feel it...
Life goal of living on Central Park West? Check.
Sorry about your car.
I can finally afford my own place in the city.
I can tweet all day without being tied to my phone.
The rent is cheep cheep cheep.
No, I've actually been doing great since the divorce.
I assembled it myself. IKEA.
It's only 'til fall. Then I head south.
Well, I couldn't stay at the Ecuadorian embassy anymore
I was tweeting before it was even a thing!
I wanted to live off the grid but near a Starbucks.
I got it for a song while the owners are south for the winter.
I found it on AirTreeNTree.
The hunky fireman of my dreams should be along soon, to help me down.  It worked for my cat!
I think while this may prove my obstetrician wrong, it could unfortunately serve to validate my psychiatrist.
The site's called AirTree'nTree.
Until the bough breaks, I’m fine.
Yeah...you probably don’t want to sit on that bench.
She puts the food right in my mouth, Fred.  In my mouth!
I'm Robin.
I wouldn't sit directly below.
If you lived here, you'd be home now.
I wouldn't sit there.
First, I said goodbye to cable. Then I reconsidered all my other entanglements.
There's laws against sleeping on the bench.
It might not look like much, but it’s in a great school district.
I swear, I was nowhere near your car.”
It's listed on Condó Nest
I still don't regret the divorce.
I said I wanted light and airy with a birds eye view of Central Park.
Catching up on my tweets.
I found it on Airbntree.
I’ve opened a branch office.
Don't worry. They're not yours.
That's right. 'Air Tree n Tree.' They're branching out.
This is where I do my best tweets.
You can have the house
They said, "Open a branch office".
They chose me to run their branch office.
You're my first sighting of a knit hatted, long coat male city pedestrian I've seen this season."
It's a house swap. I wanted to see New York and she wanted to head south for winter.
Studio, One-bedroom... who cares what they call it, I'm finally out of Brooklyn!
I'm subleasing until they get back from Capistrano.
It checked all the boxes---park view, cheap rent, and no roommates!
She asked if I'd keep them warm for 30 minutes while she ran an errand
It gets a lot of natural light.
I couldn’t believe it either. Right on the park—and cheep, cheep!
I wouldn’t sit on that bench if I were you.
It's bigger than my apartment.
It's OK. The apartment across the street gets HBO.
Sorry about your windshield.
I thought it would be a good way to pick up chicks.
My summer place is on a telephone pole in the Hamptons.
It was either this or leave Brooklyn for the suburbs.
I love living in the sticks.
I finally located my family tree.
I’m just subletting for the winter till the owner flies back.
It's called affordable housing.
Can you believe someone just left it here?
If you're going out, we need eggs.
It’s only five blocks from my office as the crow flies.
You know what they say: location, location, location.
I’m waiting for the lady with the stale bagels.
Trust me. I wouldn't sit there if I were you.
And now I can honestly tell my mom I have a little place with a view of Central Park!
It’s made out of the redacted sections of the Mueller Report
I found it on Airbnb. They call it a luxury nest with park and city views.
The Airbnb ad said it was a loft.
I got rid of everything that didn't spark joy.
Which part of ‘beautiful park views, all hardwood floors, and just one short flight up’ did you not understand?
Well the ad said best view , hardwood floors, a real cozy nature lovers delight.
You said affordable and close to the park, right?
Last year I waited until March and it was already taken.
Sorry, you'll need to wait for the branch manager
It's public housing.
It's a sublet; the owners are out of town until May.
Of course I don’t live here. I’m babysitting.
This is where I tweet all day.
Turns out my nesting instinct is stronger than I thought.
You wouldn't believe some of the crazy people I've met since I've been up here.
It has a wood interior throughout, no amenities, but it's close to the park.
The same way you'd get any living space in New York City: I killed the last occupant.
My only complaint is that it's a walk-up
It's bigger than my last Manhattan apartment, and cheaper.
Guess how the pregnancy test turned out.
It was pricey, but like the ad said, it’s got lots of natural light, an open floor plan, and hardwood throughout."
This is where I do all my best tweeting.
Didn't you see my Tweet
One bedroom. Central Park views.  What's not to like?
This morning I pooped on a Mercedes.
I met her on Twitter.
Its pretty spacious for a New York apartment.
They had me at "rent-controlled".

. . . and best of all, I can finally tell my parents that I live in a New York City high rise!
They're in Florida for the winter and asked me to watch their place.
My parents are flying in tomorrow morning.
Sure it can be unpleasant, but I'm getting millions of retweets.
It comes with the Audubon membership.
It’s just til my novel gets published.
It looked much bigger in AirBNB.
It's got all natural wood flooring, plenty of fresh air, and is right in the middle of Manhattan. It's a steal!
As a plus, the bench works as a guest house!
It was a steal - the previous owners went south for the winter.
In exchange for egg-sitting, they promised to take me south for the winter.
Ironically, dad, this makes you an empty nester.
I've finally started tweeting.
Sure it's cramped, but it's a real chick magnet.
Just seven months ‘til the Macy’s parade.
Did you find any more sticks?
It's 'Air Tree & Be'. I'll decide the star rating around midnight.
Well, for starters, I've got a Fifth Avenue address!
Location,location,location
I think we just want different things.
It’s my family tree
I'd ask you up, but I'm sitting the kids.
It's considered park adjacent.
It's my happy place -- where I first got laid.
Cozy studio. Park views. Excellent lighting. Must like squirrels.
Take a seat in the living room, I’ll be right down
It's my solution to writer's block: I'm hatching a plot.
Plus, there's no homeowner's association.
At least I don’t live with my parents.
It makes my tweets more authentic
It was advertised as a walk-up with bird’s eye view of the city.
The agent said, "Upper West Side, rent controlled with an unobstructed view of Central Park."
You can have all our stuff, Tom.  I'm de-cluttering
My parents rented out my room when I left for college
It's just a sublet, but I get it until spring.
As soon as I can fly I’m outta here.
I got it on Air Tree 'n B.
And you said I’d be on the streets
The cable guy is coming between 1 to 4.
I know it's a little cramped. But this is the Upper East Side, and if you work out the rent per square foot, it's a steal.
It's rent-controlled.  I've been here since it was a sapling.
It's a walk-up, but has great views of the park.
The Airbnb said  surrounded by nature.”
Yes, I am in my late twenties. How did you know?
Dad, you know my generation takes longer to leave the nest.
You know Mark, sometimes it's good to get out of your comfort zone
The super is a little squirrely, but the rent is nuts.
And as long as they hatch, this counts as paternity leave.
Remind me again why we broke up.
Ya and the best part is it’s vacant till late spring.
It's the next stage in the tiny house trend.
How long have you been following my tweets?
Let's see your brother brag about his Tiny House now.
It's from ikea.
As they say, pick the worst house in the best neighborhood.
I'm actually waiting for a good looking firefighter to rescue me.
I'm subletting till the owners come back from Capistrano
They don't get back until May.
I told you I live in Central Park West!
I'd invite you up, but the place is a mess.
Statistically, I'm no longer homeless.
It's a 2nd story climb-up.
It's not a nest,it's a loft.
I was already off the grid, so going off the ground wasn't a big deal.
I got better reception and it is bigger than my previous apartment.
The City says I need a fire escape.
It’s the same size as my last place, but no roommate drama.
The best part is crapping on people.
Come on! It's an open concept, high-rise with a natural wood interior and panoramic views of Central Park!
I’m normally a bird watcher but my therapist told me to try and see things from another perspective.
It's cheaper than Brooklyn
A little bird told me: "One floor walk-up for less than $2000 a month."
I wouldn't sit on that bench if I were you. My aim has improved quite a bit.
Pre-war construction, park view, natural light, and under $3,000/month
Of course we'll take turns.
Yes, I am a millennial. Why do you ask?
The meals are a little hard to swallow, but the rent is cheap cheap cheap.
Its a sublet, I've got it till spring
It's drafty but I really wanted a place on the upper east side.
For a place like this, you either have to wait for someone to die or fly south.
Priced out of Brooklyn.
You didn't believe me when I said that I was free as a bird.
It’s right in Central Park, and my roommate spends half the year traveling!
Sorry, you'll want the other Mr. Finch, three Maples down.
Chicks dig it.
They really needed some couple time, so I said I’d watch the kids.
What it lacks in privacy, it makes up for in location and price.
Actually I do have a minute to talk about the environment.
"They offered to bring me back something nice if I kept it warm.
My parents were tree-huggers, and well...here I am!
The plumbing situation is rough, but it's rent-free and it picks up WiFi from the Panera!
It's the new tiny nest movement.
A park view and no roommates...why would I turn it down?
Thank you.  The Gummy Worms were very thoughtful.
I'll tweet you.
Just got promoted to manager of the new branch office.
Dare you to sit on the bench.
I’ve had the place to myself ever since my roommate flew into a window.
Actually, I’m an attorney at a top five law firm, but this is the only apartment I could afford.
Every winter I get the whole place to myself.
The realtor explained it as an open-concept loft with a great view of the park.
The owners went south
I started tweeting and this seemed right!
You told me to move out of the basement and spread my wings!
I said I had a little nest on Central Park West.
I just got laid
Don't Worry Fred, I'm just posing for a New Yorker cartoon contest.
They’re traveling and asked me to house-sit until they return in Spring.
When I asked if you could make eggs, I meant breakfast.
I have the place all to myself, my roommate's away until the spring.
It's comfortable, it has a great view, it's free, and if I don't like the looks of somebody I can crap on them.
The guest room is more of a guest bench.
As it turned out, 'pied-à-tree' wasn't a typo."
...and I'm singing better, too.
My psychiatrist said it helps with my empty nest syndrome.
I finally realized, with free wifi I could live anywhere.
It's actually bigger than my apartment.
And I mate for life.
I’ve finally arrived. The Upper East Side with park views.
Your half would be $3,200 per month and we’d split utilities.
The rent is cheap, but you have to share a bathroom with the squirrel.
It was advertised as a second floor climb-up.
This is the next Brooklyn.
It's all pretty simple, Dave: the mother targets my ex-wife's windshield and I keep her eggs warm.
...and it's also roomier than the studio I had in East Village.
...and I get food delivered straight to my mouth.
I'm amazed at all my new followers since I started tweeting from here.
Don’t sit there that’s my bathroom
Can't say much for the food, but I am learning to sing....
Can you believe I found a studio loft in this neighborhood?
All the books say it's just a normal part of pregnancy...
So it turns out I didn't have anything that sparked joy.
And, it has more room than my old apartment.
It's off-the-grid but still only a short walk to Starbucks.
Just until the kids are out of the house.
Are you my mother?
Easiest babysitting job ever.
I figure the homeowner won't be back until spring at the earliest.
When they said AIR bnb they really meant it!
I got laid!
It was this or move back in with my parents.
You have your cave; I have my nest.
I found it on Aeriebnb.
Sorry my body confused you but I identify as a bird.
We’ll call it... ‘Airbnb’
After taxes this year, I realized this is as close to a nest egg as I'll ever get.
Starter apartment. Under $250K and Central Park views!
$25 a night in Central Park? I *love* Airbnb!
I finally found a loft above Central Park!
Oh, I don't own it.  I'm just housesitting for some empty-nesters.
My roommates are snowbirds, so I've got the whole place to myself!
I identify as a squirrel!
I'm transitioning to avian.
Ya, well, your profile doesn't mention you wear long coats.
I don't understand people who say New York isn't affordable.
It's actually more spacious than my old place on the Lower East Side.
It's the most affordable sublet I could find, but I have to be out by spring.
The square footage is about the same but I am losing the condo fees.
The listing said it has a bird's eye view of the Park.
I accumulated a tidy little nest egg and retired early.
It's a 1 bed 0 bath loft within walking distance of Central Park.
It's all I can afford after my student loan payments.
Is this a good time to tell you that I'm pregnant?
I thought “aerie bnb” was a typo
Airbnb.
Why do you ask?
Only $1000/mo for a place overlooking the park -- I couldn't be happier!
If it's a boy, Robin and if it's a girl Robyn.
The Airbnb listing said it had an unreal view of Central Park
I read a few books about decluttering my life and this just made sense Bob.
Technically it's a studio apartment, but I've been told the whole tree is mine.
Got a great deal from a couple of empty nesters
CHEAP!
It's an air bnb with a Central Park view.
I'm housesitting until the owners return from down south.
It's actually a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Why the disappointed look? my profile said Upper Eastside with a park view”.
It's quite cozy actually . . . since the wife and kids migrated.
My dad said I needed to branch out.
So I got this part time egg sitting gig. Gives me time off for auditions, and pays more than dog walking
Dad, I'm not quite ready to leave the nest.
It's called urban nesting.
Crazy, right ... who flies back from Florida in the dead of winter?!
It's not my patents' basement and it comes with several small meals throughout the day.
Wait until you see my mating dance.
Thanks, but Mom should be back soon with lunch.
The Airbnb listing said it was snug, with a view of the park.
The park view is an upgrade, and honestly, the plumbing isn’t any worse than my old place in Queens.
OK. But we'd better make it your place.
I am pretty sure that I am safe from gentrification here.
It’s reclaimed wood.
Hey Pal - Mama Bird could use a coffee & a scone over here.
No, wise-ass, I'm not sitting on eggs.  But you're standing on dog poop.
Yes, it's very comfortable and the view is great.  If it weren't for the regurgitated food, I'd definitely give this place a five-star rating.
It's the LJUNGSKILE bed, but I lost the assembly instructions.
Son, when I said “work on your nest egg”, this wasn’t quite what I had in mind...
It's only uncomfortable when the eagle returns.
You're gonna bring the ladder back, right?
It's just a sublet while the owners go south for the winter.
Location;... Location; ...Location!
Alright, you’ve made your point. We’ll move to Jersey and get a bigger place.
I'm peeping, Tom.
I told her I'd sit on them while she ran an errand. It's been three days now. I'm starting to get worried.
It's an Airbnb owned by a couple who went south for the winter!
The hardest thing?  Sticking to the diet.
I know, I know.. but we we'll be able to afford private school for the kids!
I'm just house-sitting for a couple of snowbirds.
Let's just say it's below market rate for a park view.
So, I said, "Oh, yeah? If Donald Trump ever becomes President, I'll live in a tree. I've been here for over 2 years now."
I was fired for Tweeting at my last job, but the new boss seems to be pretty lax about it.
This can’t be the strangest thing you have seen in this city
It's a Tree-bedroom no bathroom.
Hey it’s Manhattan. I feel lucky that I found this for the night under $300.
I never dreamed I'd find an aerie overlooking Central Park for just $4000 a month.
I'll come down when America is great again.
It's technically a studio loft.
I'm learning to tweet.
So, I'm making $15.00 an hour and all I have to do is turn the eggs twice a day!
I’m housesitting for a friend while he’s south for the winter.
I'm taking a gap year, dad!
Park view and only five hundred a month.
Their Airbnb profile said, " Central Park view, plenty of grub"
I can take the bench tonight, if you'd be more comfortable...
Stand under the tree. I dare you.
It’s prewar, and look at this hardwood!
I'm calling it 'Gentreefication'.
Park views, walking distance to The Met, tons of outdoor space - and it's only $4850 a month!
I've taken the tiny houses trend to new heights.
Where else are you going to find a park view for $1,700 a month?
It all started with my parents sitting in this tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
I call it my little place on the beech.
It’s not much, but it’s a chick magnet.
I only pay $3,000 a month, AND I have a view of the park!
No, the question is, "what are you doing DOWN THERE?"
Totally amicable. Beth got the gilded cage.
They are artificial twigs from Ikea. Assembly was a snap.
Just keeping them warm until she gets back.
I wouldn't stand there if I were you.
Welcome to the Upper Nest Side
This is what they don't tell you about unpaid internships.
I sublet it from some snowbirds.
Sure, there's no privacy, but I can tell everyone that I live in the city.
The views are great but the rent is nuts.
Easiest real estate transaction ever; did it all over tweets!
The listing read “Available immediately, previous owners relocated to warmer climate, cozy studio with great views of the park...
Finally a walk up that I can afford
All I need is for you to co-sign, Dad.
It's my tweet spot.
Oh I’m just house sitting for the week, my tree is actually over there.
But, Dad, it's, like, my first baby-sitting job!
I got it on Airbntree.
1 Bdrm CPW, hi flr, 360 views.  Walk up.
I’m usually gone in the evenings, so you’d have the place to yourself.
They said I couldn't sleep on the bench anymore.
It's mine until Spring when the owners will be returning from Mexico.
It's listed on airbnb as "authentic tree nest experience".
...and I've got the place to myself until Spring.
I wanted a first floor climb-up with lots of natural light.
I know. I still can’t believe it’s rent controlled.
I know what you’re thinking, how could I afford a place in the city with a view.
...and I don’t even have to chew my own food.
It's an Upper East Side zip code.
It's just a sub-let... The owners go south for the winter.
Not only do I save $$ on an apartment, but it's a great place to pick up chicks!!
This is where I hatch my best ideas.
Yup, my divorce is final today!
My parents just said that it was time to leave THEIR nest.
Egg sitting is the new dog walking
If you can get past the pre-chewed food, it's actually a pretty sweet gig.
Well, they want us off the streets.
We met on Timber.
Homeless maybe, but not treeless.
Just resting on my laurels.
I hatch my best ideas up here.
I don't think they'll be back until spring
Eat your heart out, it's rent controlled.
6 million people stream me on my nest cam.
It's a wonderful Bed and Breakfast, but don;t order the eggs!
You’re in luck—it’s mating season.
I'm donating my eggs
Honey, I'll come back down after I finish tweeting.
First month's, last month's, and a bag of acorns.
The listing mentioned a feather bed.
The owners were moving down to Florida so I bought it for a song.
It’s a great gig. They come by to feed me every day, I pay no rent, and all I have to do is keep the eggs warm.
The squirrels sublet it for peanuts."
You can rent one of theses for a song.
I like to tweet on location
You have your man cave. Now I have my nest.
I call it my 'Marie Kondo condo'.
Just house sitting - the owners are snowbirds and will be back in May.
I’m just not ready to leave the nest!
Go find your own empty nest.
I hear a couple Maples on 59th are still available through AirB&B
I'm up here on a lark.
Believe it or not, the most disturbing part of this is my singing.
I'm tired of city life.  I've moved to the sticks.
2 stars. Park view, but a bit cramped and just eggs for breakfast.
I know Dad, I’m just not ready to leave the nest.
Found it on AiryBnB.  Why?
You said I had to branch out!
My parents dropped me off here when I told them that I wasn't ready to leave the nest yet.
Airbnb on Central Park, $30
I’m in a different place now.
I found it on Airbnb.  It includes breakfast.
Actually most of my neighbors aren't birds anymore, they're people I went to college with
The tiny house was too big.
I'm housesitting until the owner returns from South America.
It wasn’t advertised on line. A little birdie told me.
Hardwood floors throughout.
Welcome to the Branch Office at Park Place.
The treetop views are what sold me.  Plus, my roommate goes south every winter.
Hey mister, got any bread?
This beats living with my parents.
She said I lacked the ambition to live on Central Park West.
Monday I'm getting cable.
Nature-lover seeks roommate for lovely NY loft with plenty of natural light.
My parents always told me I would end up in a place overlooking the Park.
It's small, but it overlooks the park and I get to tweet all day.
Why are you down there?
Yes, this is the advertised cozy and affordable Mid-Town nest for rent!
I just love driving the bird watchers crazy.
I’m house sitting while the owners are south for the winter.
It's just an Airbnb, the owners have a nest in Boca for the winter
Learning to fly was easier than living in a fifth floor walk-up
I found something I can afford that isn’t a walk-up.
Yeah, I’m an empty nester. What’s your story?
Have you seen the tuition at NYU?
If I migrate, they might not let me back in the country.
It's for millennials without a nest egg.
Yes, it's probably an illegal sublet.
Who knew Fifth Avenue could be cheaper than the West Side?
Yep, Airbnb.  I can't wait to see what's for breakfast.
Mom should be back any minute with breakfast
And can you believe it? - She waived the broker's fee!
The ad called it a cozy rental with a view of Central Park.
It was the only loft with a view of the park in my price range.
"What did I say, Fred? Location, Location, Location.
Guess who's pregnant?
I changed my mind, I want kids.
Just don't stand there, bring me mud and twigs.
Just tell mom I found a cozy nest with a park view, and not to worry.
It's an air tree n tree.
Well it’s better than living with you!
Airbnb.  Central Park Views.  What more can you ask for?
But when they hatch, we'll be splitting the rent four ways!
My psychiatrist encouraged me to branch out!
Yes, but you can't beat the location.
It's not much smaller than my last place. And it has a great view of the park.

I just refuse to be THAT millennial who has to move back in with his parents.
If you're interested, I can talk to my roommates when they get back.
Yeah...I live in a loft off Central Park
I have a flying lesson at two o'clock!
It's the only affordable sublet on the Upper West Side.
I thought it wouldn’t kick in until later in the pregnancy, but here I am.
I found it online at Treebnb.
Don't worry I'm not going to poop on you
Bees do it, birds do it, why can't we do it?
The rent is decent, and I rarely get asked to host Thanksgiving.
AirBnB said it was light and airy.
It still has more room and better lighting than your studio.
Ironically, I moved here because I lost my nest egg.
Nesting, Norman, it is called nesting.
I make my living by house-sitting.

It started when he retweeted me.
Air B & B
I gave her everything, I just wanted out.
I know it’s small, but the view is spectacular.
Yea the rent is great, but my roommate is a little flighty.
It’s bigger than my old apartment, has a better view, plenty of outdoor space and you can’t beat the rent. No kitchen, but I order in anyway. I just have to request tall delivery guys.
Don't worry.  I use the restroom across the street.
Yeah, it’s a bit drafty. But it’s affordable and in Manhattan.
She said she wouldn’t be long.
There's really good wifi up here.
and theres no property tax!
She said free eggs if I keep the rent warm. Wait, I hope I don't have that backwards.
Would you mind sitting on some eggs while I call my broker?
I just jumped on the ad “Low-rent dwelling adjacent to park”
I just got tired of being stigmatized as homeless
The landlord is a little squirrelly...
It's a new Airbnb category
Yeah, it lacks privacy-but the rents low, and it’s near the bus stop,,,
I decided not to go south for the winter.
I just bought it from a couple of snowbirds."
This is not what I meant when I told you to branch out.
I tell you Frank, this life isn’t just for the birds!
So, your nest or mine?
It’s just a sublet.
You're not gonna get fed any worms standing down there.
The owners are away until spring.  Until then, I’m all set!
And the best part is I get served breakfast in bed.
Welcome to my pied-à-tree.
I sat on the fence for a while, until I found this place. It really grows on you!
Laugh all you want--It's rent controlled.
Yes, I'm pregnant!  Why do you ask?
I'm renting this for peanuts...
The broker listing described it as an ‘airy studio overlooking the park and occasional bench sleeper.’
This has gotten me over a thousand more followers on Instagram.
Who said you can’t find affordable housing in New York City?
When it gets cold, I'll migrate.
My living arrangements are still up in the air.
I'm not high, you're high.
It's all good, Dad. I set my own rules, and I come and go as I please. Moreover, a park bench is within walking distance.
Come on up. My roommate's out of town.
- Well, I AM an apple branch manager!
And only $1,800 a month.
Can you believe it?!
They kept trying to ease me out of the nest, so I thought "I'll show them!"
Saving $ 2,850 a month, with more space.
We decided not to go south this winter.
The last tenant's s@#% was everywhere, but I got a good deal on it.
It's a pied-à-tree
You must be the empty nester from next door.
Eco-friendly, open concept design, solar lights and heating, all wood interior, great view of the park...it was a no-brainer. I had to take it!

I plan to look for a job after I fledge.
Just keep watch for a big, angry bird flying around here.
Cheap rent, good view, and I don't have to tell anyone I live in Jersey!

This is my first air b-n-b!
And just what I wanted. A cozy urban nest with a view of the park.
I'm still getting the hang of Twitter.

A guy brings me spaghetti, one piece at a time.
Yeah, but the property taxes are nothing.
It's really taken my people-watching to the next level.
I got a terrific deal on this sublet while the owners are away in the south.
...and the omelette was amazing!
There's a nice DoubleTree in town, but this SingleTree is a lot more economical.

So extreme downsizing turned out to be my best option.
The rest of my family migrated to Florida.
Dad, can I still use your Netflix login?
I'm actually looking to sublet, maybe spend summer in the south

It's the cheapest one bedroom I could find.

Come down? Are you kidding--it's rent controlled!
Staying home is the new flying south
The rent is not as bad as you'd think for place overlooking Central Park.
They told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up.
What really holds the place together is my spit.
Yes, this is what I meant by "nesting". What did you think it meant?
I'm just house-sitting for a friend who winters in the south.
Sleeping's not so bad, but bathroom breaks are brutal.
It's a "light-filled, aerie studio," just like the ad says.
And the ravens are charging half of what I was paying in SoHo.

There's no wifi, but I've got a bird's eye view of the park!
Damnit Alex! - You are taking this empty nester thing way too far.
I’m just watching the chicks until she gets back.
I'm pregnant, John.
Tiny houses? Yeah, I was pretty into those a couple years ago.
The WiFi is a little spotty but the maintenance is dirt cheap.

And the best part? It's rent controlled."
It's not mine. I'm just house sitting for the winter.
Just enjoying my nest egg.

It’s when she brings my lunch that you may wish to turn away.

I downsized.”
They sold me with “birds-eye view of the city!”
You never know who's sat on those benches.
The only thing I had left that “brought me joy” was this plaid hat.
Don’t worry.  My parents still come by to feed me.
And it came with breakfast!
I'm not an empty nester any more!
No, it's not a statement on homelessness, or part of a Zen-like journey to enlightenment, it just feels good on my hemorrhoids.
It's not so bad, I can see my old apartment from here.
I'm egg sitting for a friend

My Dad gave me a nest egg.

Please excuse the mess. I wasn't expecting company.
And it’s all mine till the owner comes back in the spring!
'They can't evict me.  This space is protected under the Endangered Species Act."

No, I am not a little cuckoo. Guess again..
In today's economy, this is my only chance at a nest egg.
I’ll only come home if you stop calling me birdbrain.
How else could I afford this view?"
Who's the cuckoo now, Jim?

What if I told you squirrels make the best pillows?
It's only a one-floor climb-up!
Maybe we should have read the Air B&B reviews more carefully.
You must have heard my mating call!
Now you’re the one who’s grounded.

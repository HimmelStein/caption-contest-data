I wish we'd noticed that before eating Bob.
I wish we’d seen that before we ate Dave.
I do not see a lifesaver.
Think there are any Life Savers?
See any Lifesavers?
I really don't have any room left after we ate John.
I see two palm trees, a tire, and some driftwood. Why do you ask?
Over there they call it macarooned.
Oldest shark trick in the book
If only we had a Life Saver.
Looks desserted to me.
It looks totally desserted.
Is it just me or are the sharks getting smarter?
If you say 'desserted island' one more time....
Looks completely desserted.
It appears desserted.
Over there we’d be macarooned.
So dessert island wasn’t a typo after all.
The least they could do is throw us a Life Saver.
It looks like the sharks have upped their game
It's a trick.  Once you get over there they try to sell you a timeshare.
Chances are, one of us isn't real either...
And I thought we had wrecked near the Sandwich Islands.
After eating Johnson, I don't have room for dessert.  How about you?
It's called the Isle of Just Desserts.
Too bad there's no life savers.
Looks like it's desserted.
The Sandwich Islands must be nearby.
Ronald, I swear, if you call that a "desserted" island one more time...
I've been there. It's a miniature golf course.
I could have sworn these were the Sandwich Islands...
Looks like we're macarooned.
It’s the Isle of Just Desserts.
'Looks desserted.'
Well, now that we've polished off Mary Ann, Ginger, The Howells, and the Professor, guess we could swim over there for a little dessert...
Remember to wait a half hour before you swim back.
Give me that dang lamp before you waste the next two wishes!
A boat, Kevin. You should have wished for a boat.
I thought you said these were the sandwich islands!
Do you think they have lifesavers over there?
I thought you said we were going to the Sandwich Islands.
It’s obviously desserted.
It looks like a desserted island.
according to Yelp, the buttercream alone is worth the trip
Do you suppose it has life savers?
Weird, no Life Savers...
We could use Life Savers.
I've read enough German fairy tales to know not to fall for it.
Great. Now my appetite is spoiled for my dinner mirage.
It’s one of the Greek islands- Dextrose.
I guess we didn’t have to eat Danny. Or our raft.
If  I make it, i’ll throw you a Life Saver.
It's a well-known shark trick.
Of course they forgot the Life Savers.
I'm staying put.  That island is clearly desserted.
When was that island desserted?
Oh, you see that too? We probably should've talked about that before we ate Steve.
Seriously?  A dessert island?
You're not thinking about desserting me too?
Maybe we are the illusion
What exactly was your third wish?
I am seeing naked ladies; what are you seeing?
Do you think the whole island is desserted?
You said the Jones’s weren’t going to decorate this year.
All that, and not a life saver to be seen  !
I think that’s what they call a dessert island.
Last year there were 2 rows of chocolate chips but, you know - climate change.
Dude, what was in that coconut?
You do realize that was our third wish.
You should be pleased to know, it takes my mind off of eating you."
So this is hell.
Let's swim to the Sandwich Islands first.
I've got a bad feeling about this, Gretel.
Seems like the First Class passengers are holding up okay.
You know, if it weren’t for autocorrect, we would be on dessert island right now.
Do you think there’s a Lifesaver over there?
You think they’ve got any Lifesavers?
Definitely desserted.
Clever, clever sharks.
That island is obviously desserted.
That's why they call it Statin Island!
It's the island of just desserts!
That must be the desserted  island.
Figures! We get the desert island and they get the dessert island.
And thus concludes the tale of Baskin Robinson Crusoe.
Even my delusions are just out of reach.
I dont see any lifesavers over there...
Your mother goes to such great lengths to get us to visit.
Reminds me of the Republican tax plan
It seems to be desserted.
Nobody over there. It’s desserted.
How about that?  A desserted island!
It's the gummy sharks that scare me.
It looks as if its desserted.
Well I don’t think it’s one of the Sandwich Islands.
Yeah, but we've got the nicer view.
They were just a scone's throw from a desserted island.
True, but we've got shade.
Yeah, I don't see it either.
Alas, here we are, but for a simple spelling mistake.
All that candy, and not one lifesaver.
Who knew sharks could bake?
Yesterday it looked like a roasted chicken.
Frankly, I wish it were Sandwich Island.
I yearn for the simple old days, when there was only pie-in-the-sky.
Trust me, if we had chosen that island all we would be thinking about is the simple beauty of this one.
Of course you don't think it's real, you've been nothing but negative since we washed up here.
Looking back we had it pretty good there
It looks pretty desserted.
No dinner, no dessert.
Ooh, that reminds me. We're also out of coffee.
I can't believe they still have their candy canes up.
That island is completely desserted.
So tell me again. When the ship sank why did we swim here?
That island looks desserted.
As mirages go, it's particularly cruel.
Looks like that island is desserted.
If you knew how to spell, we'd be on dessert island.
That one looks both deserted and desserted"
Remember when this one looked like that?
Looks like a desserted island to me.
I think it's desserted.
Dear Editor:  I am sorry that you have to read 3000 captions about a desserted island.
I'm holding out for Taco Tuesday.
So *that's* why they call it a desserted island
The sharks have sure upped their game.
Hmm, I guess Amazon DOES deliver everywhere.
It's a new mirage; yesterday it was two-for-one beers.
That's what sharks call phishing.
But what if we're the mirage?
So that's what a desserted island looks like.
I'd say it looks desserted.
It's not the swim over, it's the swim back...
We can die healthy here, or swim over and die happy there.
It's desserted.
Seriously, Frank, if "marooned on a dessert island" wasn't funny six months ago, it's not funny now.
I'll  bet it's crawling with ants.
Now do you see why spelling matters?
The sharks have really upped their game.
We can work it off on the way back.
Yeah,but we have to wait an hour to swim back.
Adam, somehow this feels like a test.
If only there was a sugar plum ferry.
I wish this island was desserted.
So, you choose to believe THIS, but not global warming?!?
Did your note in a bottle say "Deserted, send help" or "Help, send dessert"
Sure, it looks good but it's just eye candy.
Is this what you meant by getting our 'just desserts'?
"I presume it's our just desert."
Yeah, but we’d have to wait an hour before we swam back.
That island's been desserted for years.
Yeah, it's close, but the water's infested with Swedish Fish.
Why don't you swim over there and see if you can rustle us up a lifesaver.
As far as mirages go, this is the best one yet.
Location, location, location
You don't say. I see naked women.
Miami sure went under quick.
Because I'm your dentist, that's why.
The Airbnb review said, "Sweet view."
Honey.. Why does it seem like the Robinsons are always trying to out do us?
Dont do it. You’ll spoil your dinner.
Well, we are out of coconuts...
Remember to wait an hour before swimming back.
We could swim for it, though, at best, we'd be macarooned.
I know it's been really foggy since we got here, but I'm just saying that, well, we may have been a little premature, you know, eating my leg.
Nope, that’s a dessert island.
You can't swim it. The waters are infested with gummy fish.
Don't learn to swim, you said. We'll never need to, you said.
What, and spoil dinner?
And stare at a tree? No, thank you.
Are they EVER going to take down the Christmas decorations?
This whole trip has been one bad decision after another.
I would have preferred a main course island.
You had to eat the lifesavers
C'mon, Hansel, what's the worst that could happen?
Why don't you swim over there and see if you can rustle us up some lifesavers.
Dessert Island?  I thought that was a typo.
Hmm … looks quite desserted.
That genie gave you ONE wish and that's all you could think of?
Legend has it that the good ship Lollipop went down near here.
Maybe we should have waited before eating Phillip.
I always wanted to be on a dessert island.
Is it my imagination or is that a dessert island?
It's an illusion, Dwayne.  It's really nothing but kale and quinoa.
I thought Dessert Island was a typo when I first saw it on the map....
Do they deliver?
No, I don't see anything.
Yeah, but we have a tree.
I know, but look on the bright side, we have a tree.
These sharks don't give up.
You go ahead, I don't want to spoil my dinner.
Think we can make it? Looks like a piece of cake.
Eye candy.
Looks like just another desserted island to me.
I told you this place wasn’t desserted.
Oh, I get it. Desserted island.
I'm waiting for pie in the sky.
Obviously DESSERTED!
C'mon. We'll burn it off in the swim back.
Beware the gummy sharks.
Those humpback whales are getting really sarcastic.
If the sharks don’t get us the refined sugar will.
what if we're their mirage?
So help me God, Carl, you say "dessert island" one more time and I will kill you.
I’ve never heard of anyone being stranded on a dessert island.
It looks so desserted.
Wanna sit on the other side and look at the island of naked models again?
I’m gonna wait for one with a bar.
Clearly it's a dessert island.
Hey, do you think there are lifesavers over there?
You really don't see it?
Huh...I thought we were in the Sandwich Islands.
Ok. Cool. Now lets imagine our sailboat.
It's oddly desserted over there.
No one’s over there - it’s desserted.
I've heard of mirages,but this takes the cake.
At least we don't have ants.
But then we'd get fat and it would be harder to meet people.
As hallucinations go, it's not bad.
Look!  A desserted  island.
I wish I could swim." "I wish you could spell.
Do you think they're looking at us as a source of protein?
Chill...it's an old cannibal trick.
Once more: THIS is a desert island, and THAT is a dessert island. Understand?
Offshore baking.
It certainly looks desserted.
Cane mutiny survivors?
The sharks are getting a lot more creative.
I swam over once. They’re plastic.
I'm glad we made the healthy choice.
I think these are carb infested waters.
If the sharks don't get us the sugar will.
Do you think they have a root beer float that could take us there?
*This* close to being macarooned
I thought you said, ‘Swim for the desert island.’
Do me one favor, will you - stop saying 'dessert' island.
It's the lost city of Fatlantis.
If we were stuck on that island,I'd hate myself. But since we're stuck on this island,I hate you.
If you want coffee with dessert, the next island is Java.
The swimming will cancel out the calories.
Another cartoonist who can’t spell.
You think we're the main course?
But these are gummy shark infested waters.
I liked the mirage with the girls better.
I've tried swimming over there several times but it's all just a gimmick to try to get you to sign up for cable TV.
Swim to the one with the tree you said. We need shade, you said.
If we must be stranded, why not on a dessert island instead?
How 'bout we go for a quick swim and then grab some dessert?
We need to stop smoking whatever this tree is made of.
Don't be fooled. Those are antennae.
How come you never invite me to your place?
I liked it better when it was a Starbucks.
At least we have somewhere to go for our vacation.
Remember when our island used to look like that.
I don’t know, I’m actually in the mood for pizza.
I blame spell-check.
Yesterday it looked  like pizza.
Tempting, but we should probably hit the sandwich isles first.
The Lord works in misspelled ways.
Let's wait until they try barbecue and a bucket of beer on ice.
Nobody knows why their civilization died out.
Don't say: "it's better than being macarooned on a dessert island" ever again.
Frankly, I prefer yesterday’s steak dinner mirage.
In retrospect, life was sweeter over there.
And that's what became of the cane mutiny.
If it makes you feel any better, we are also surrounded by undrinkable water.
Yeah that’d be sweet, but I would kill for some toilet paper
As mirages go, it's pretty sweet!
I hear their president wants to build a gingerbread wall.
Pretty sure it's a meringue...
Tomorrow we'll fantasize Hillary won.
If you start singing “Candyman” again, I swear I’ll kill you.
It's just the tip of an icing berg.
Judging by that desserted isle, I guess we're somewhere near the Tropic of Candicorn.
This is like one of those New Yorker cartoons.
Maybe. But we've got the fiber.
Wow...a floating typo!
Why didn't we end up on that desserted island?
If we swim over, we can't swim back for 2 hours.
We stay put.  No one has ever been rescued from a dessert island."
I'm saving myself for entree island.
Sure you'd make it, it's a piece of cake.
You know Thomas, they're looking at us and thinking the same thing.
Do you suppose they see us the same way we see them?
We came that close to being stranded on a dessert island."
The starvation I can deal with. It's the pun that's killing me.
But can we really trust our eyes after the mermaid incident?
The Jones's love to rub it in.
Maybe they deliver.
So god DOES have a sense of humor.
Yes, that island is most definitely desserted.
I never realized how clever sharks are.
I might as well put that island right on my thighs.
I thought hell would have flames.
But the 2 mile swim to Kale Cove would be better for your core.
How much insulin do we have left?
All we need is an ice cream float
You can have your island and eat it too
I don't think we should go, it looks desserted.
I swear! If you say that's the way the cookie crumbles ONE more time...
No, no. I’d much rather be here with you.
Nice eh? Last night I saw the sharks building it.
This whole time I thought you were saying 'desert' island.
I went there once, too touristy.
Yes but it certainly looks desserted
Frankly, I liked the pizza mirage better.
The better hallucination would be a boat, dear.
Now that’s what I call a dessert island.
I'm pretty sure it's a dessert island.
Dougs not coming back is he?
We can swim over if you want, but it looks desserted!
A dessert island just seems wrong somehow.
I say we're headed for a period of global icing.
See, that island probably has ants.
I don’t know, Gretel. It looks like a  trap.
You couldn't have aimed for the desserted island?
The swim back will work off the calories.
This is my favorite hallucination.
One more ‘desserted island’ joke and I swear I’ll eat you.
Empty calories vs. no calories is looking pretty good.
Sharks? No, it’s the high fructose corn syrup that scares me.
Well, you gotta decide before high tide.
Really? In my mirage it's all gouda and brie and manchego.
And your second wish?
Hey look — a desserted island.
On the way there, you're all hopes and dreams, but on the way back, you're just shark bait...
Look, a dessert island!
Ahhh. “Desserted island.”
It's called a dessert island.
I wouldn't worry... last week, I thought I saw Chutes and Ladders...
This one’s empty. That one’s desserted.
One of these days, we're just going to forget that we're dentists.
When we're done we have to wait an hour before we swim back.
I wish we'd skipped appetizer island now.
I prefer to eat local.
Did you type "deserted" or "desserted" island into the booking website?
I wonder if they deliver?
These hallucinations are getting better.
Really? My hallucination is a lot of naked women.
That’s a desserted island!
Now do you believe me about rising sea levels?  Look what’s become of Big Rock-candy mountain.
How about we take the Life Savers.
That was The Big Rock Candy Mountain before climate change.
Of COURSE I'd swim across, but all the lifesavers are over there
That island looks totally desserted.
I’ve noticed my energy and attention levels have really improved since we got off that god-forsaken thing.
There’s the proof. Global sweetening.
Of course, I requested a desserted island! Damned spell check!
Meh. I’m waiting for a mirage with liquor.
Don’t try to sugarcoat it, we picked the wrong island.
I don't know, I heard that neighborhood is a little unsavory.
No,” you said, “Why would we need swimming lessons?” you said
Looks like a dessert island.
The irony is not lost on me that the dessert island is deserted.
Here we are on a desert island because you couldn't spell.
It’s just desserts.
See, I told you the mushroom was edible.
You don't suppose there's a roll of LIFE SAVERS?
Oh, that's a dessert island.
Not until you finish your fronds.
What I wouldn’t give for a Lifesaver...
You want to head over there after dinner?
What do you mean "we have to have dinner first."
No, that one's desserted.
Desert, dessert, potato, potahto.
Even here, my hallucinations are 100% carbs.
What a cruel way to explain what a homonym is.
These sharks are really bringing their A game.
Now if we can just get past the gummi sharks...
Just our luck. You can't swim and I've got diabetes"
What would Gilligan do?
You know, maybe we're the mirage.
I always wanted to be shipwrecked on a dessert island ...
...So Monopoly and Chutes and Ladders were mirages, but Candyland is a go?
...and I was just about to eat you.
Our island isn't much, but it's got a sweet view."
That's a completely desserted island.
You start with one and pretty soon you've eaten a whole archipelago.
That's all there's left of the Good Ship Lollipop.
Nice to finally see the difference between desert island and a dessert
island
I told you we should have gone with the all-inclusive.
I don't know, Gretel. It looks like another trap.
No, that's a D-E-S-S-E-R-T island.
I can't remember what I've been hallucinating longer, you or that island in the distance.
All in all, I'd rather be on the desserted island.
That's how you decided to spend our one wish?
It’s always sweeter on the other isle
When you said 'candy aisle,' I pictured something different.
I told you Amazon delivers EVERYWHERE!
Castaway calories don't count.
Hope we're not the main course.
Let's have our cake and islet too.
I’m just never enough for you, am I?
If you say that's "a sweet view" one more time, you've moving over there.
You go, I'm a salty person.
Looks pretty sweet over there.
Another mirage.  Yesterday it was Bud Light.
I really was hoping for something salty.
For the millionth time; yes, that is a desserted island!
That genie is a stickler for pronunciation.
Too bad we weren’t macarooned on that island.
It's kind of ironic really. I've been misspelling desert for years.
Let's wait for the roast beef mirage.
Well the AirBNB description did say it was private with tantalizing views.
I told you, "dessert islands" are just a typ'o mirage.
That's Brexit Island. It's further away than it looks.
The bright side is—no ants.
Last of the polar icing.
Just a consonant away.
Look!  We've been completely desserted.
We may be stranded, but we're not desserted.
No, I said DESSERT island!
I'm suspicious because an hour ago it was covered with scantily-clad women.
Beats an island of kale.
I see hot women in bikinis.  what do you see?
I hear it’s pretty sweet there.
Think we can make it past the Swedish fish?”
I think it's one of those desserted islands.
Amazing what a difference one little letter makes.
Remember to wait at least one hour before you swim back.
You can try to swim it, but watch for the Swedish fish.
We'll be ok.  The Good Ship Lollypop comes once a week or so
Is it bait or are we?
Would you call it home sweet home?
If we were on that island I would probably stop dreaming about eating you.
You're seeing things, John. That island is clearly desserted.
It's a dessert island"
Do you think they deliver?
Frank's been over there for two hours.  Maybe you should go check on him.
You know, I had something completely different in mind when my agent booked me  on “Temptation Island.”
If it was real, there would be more chocolate.
a desserted island???
Thanks for dinner.  Want to head over to my place for a bit of dessert?
They called it the Big Rock Candy Mountain before climate change.
No one lives there.  It’s a desserted island.
Don't spoil your appetite - wait for the main course mirage.
It was the roof of the world's largest bakery before the sea began rising.
They're trying to attract an Amazon HQ
Make sure to wait an hour before you come back.
It never tastes as good as it looks.
It seems to me we're nowhere near the Sandwich Islands.
Go for it if you  want.  I saw the sharks set it up last night.
I’m telling you, one cheat day won’t hurt.
It could be worse. There could be a wall around it.
It's just as well. I have absolutely no willpower.
Yeah, that island is definitely desserted.
One letter makes a big difference , huh?
Maybe we should relocate to a dessert island.
My palm tree doesn't spark joy anymore.
I think I’m gonna have to resort to candybalism.
Dude, how many more days of the medicinal marijuana do we have left?
Best mirage of the week.
I kinda regret voting her off the island.
It's teeming with gummy sharks. We'd never make it.
So it's safe to say the Big Rock Candy Mountain was more impressive before climate change.
Dude, check out that island over there.....sweet...
desserted island, deserted island --- i knew we should have spell-checked it!
Nobody goes there anymore since they switched to high fructose corn syrup.
Boy that genie's a real stickler for pronunciation huh?
You think the genie will come back? I’m starting to regret my choices.
So what if it's not a mirage, neither of us can swim..
After you finish be sure to wait an hour before you try to swim back.
Pity about the sharks.
I think tooth decay is the least of our worries
I think tomorrow I'll sit on the other side of the island.
That looks good, but the island of naked women is still my favorite mirage.
I'm starting to think we should have gone with the all inclusive.
I just assumed the travel agent meant ocean-view suites.
This is where you end up for eternity when you cheat at Candyland.
I know we agreed you would write the note. I just think  "we are stranded next to a dessert island"  doesn't really pop.
That's probably our best hallucination so far."
I've heard of the Sandwich Islands, but this is ridiculous!
That's a Desserted Island. Rookie mistake.
It’s a piece of cake.
Plans to eat you have been postponed.
What do you think, Hansel?
Well, here goes my beach body.
Desert. Dessert.  Do you see now why spelling matters?
Not until we've had dinner.
Do you ever wonder if we’re the mirage?
Nah. That one’s way too desserted.
Remember how you were soooo sure "dessert island" was just a typo on the map?
Don’t you think about desserting me!
I told you it looked desserted.
It would be a better spot for the hammock.
Dude! It's just the acid! We're on your front porch! That's an Ice Cream Truck!!
Still don't believe in Global Warming? That's all that's left of the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Do you ever regret picking the vegan island?
The sharks are getting mighty cunning, George...
Let’s desert the desert for the dessert
With a little luck, we could have been shipwrecked on a dessert island.
So that’s what you meant by a desserted island.
It looks 'dessert-ed'.
Those sharks are getting smarter by the day.
They're probably stale anyway.
Like, I don’t think those were normal mushrooms man!
I'm sorry. I thought I was signing us up for that desserted island...
That’s one hell of a desserted island.
Remember you thought Bikini Island sounded like paradise, too?
Even though it cost us our teeth, I don’t regret one moment of the 8 years we spent on that island.
Looks like the neighbors are having a party.
I guess spelling really does matter.
Hey man, that's some powerful weed you got there.
So you can't swim and I'm diabetic...
They say that sugar is the real killer.
Could be a trick, Hansel
It's called "dessertification".
Was that strawberry there yesterday?
So the fish gave you one wish.  Just one wish.
If it’s not a mirage, it’s a misspelling.
Finally, our just desserts.
I can't wait for my cheat day.
Great choice. Starve or gain back the weight I lost.
Actually, you have to hand it to the sharks. It's tempting AND a pretty clever pun.
Life Savers??
Nice! Now do the one with roast beef, turkey and mashed potatoes.
It’s too risky: gluten, sugar, trans fats and sharks.
It's a piece of cake for anyone who can swim.
But remember, you have to wait an hour before you can come back.
I wish we had gotten stranded on the desserted island!
Boy, those sharks are clever.
I don't know, I'd feel kinda guilty, not having had dinner.
It seems a little too ‘Hansel and Gretel’, don’t you think?
Maybe I'm hallucinating, but it looks desserted to me.
Well, here we die of starvation. There, diabetes
It's an old shark trick.
You distract the sharks. I'll cover you.
Hey...it's just desserts.
I dunno. It feels like a trap.
Why couldn't we have landed on the desserted island?
As hallucinations go, that's a pretty damned good one.
I think we’ll burn all the calories on the way back
Let's wait. Tomorrow's my cheat day.
It’s not a mirage, it’s a typo.
Yes, we can swim over, but we’ll need to wait at least a half hour before we swim back.
Don't fall for it. This island looked the same way from over there.
Yeah, but you should see the size of the ants.
Wanna go out for dessert tonight?
Apparently, before global warming, that was Big Rock Candy Mountain.
And you said sharks aren't intelligent.
It's a trick, I tell ya.  It's how it lures its prey
Next time you book your fantasy vacation, Ralph, try to remember that “dessert” has a double “s”.
Who knew genies took spelling so seriously?
I’d swim over, but I know I’d regret it later.
It's as if this weight loss program wants us to fail.
Dying in a cliché is one thing, but I draw the line at puns.
Those sharks are really clever!
So where do you think the rescue boat will stop first?
The swim is not that far -- piece of cake.
Only three and a half stars on Yelp though...
We should have paid for the upgrade.
Well, they gave me 2 choices, but I forgot how to spell dessert...
I know we're starving today, it's just that I'll hate myself tomorrow.
What a difference an extra S makes.
The irony is that the grass is greener on this side.
I love it, I really do. But, next time you come across a genie in a bottle, promise me you'll come get me.
It truly is a desserted island.
Really? You couldn't have wished us off the island?
You know we'll have to wait 30 minutes before we come home?
Y'know what else has one "s?" Stranded.
Lent always seems to come at a difficult time
That's what's left of The Big Rock Candy Mountain after climate change.
Don't even think about it - I saw the sharks building it last night.
What do you think, Gretel?
This is the moment you're supposed to say - 'Life with you is sweet enough!'
I say it's just desserts.
But you'll probably burn it all off on the swim back
Let's stay.  We can't just show up empty handed.
I always wondered what life was like on a desserted island.
Technically speaking, a desert island is an island, islet or atoll that is not permanently populated by humans.  That one, however, is desserted.
The artist forgot to draw shark fins, so I think it's safe to swim over.
Oh, right.  Two esses.
Sure, it looks nice from here. But pretty soon you're thinking, man, what I really want is a tree.
I think it's called a dessert island.
...and we'd burn the calories on the swim back.
Yeh-- but we have the palm tree.
Funny, that’s just how I imagined a desserted island would look.
You tell me what you see first.
I've got a thousand bucks that says it's just a typo.
I told you when you booked it-Dessert Island has two "S's".
One thing is certain, it will taste better than the kids.
I think we should try the desserted island for a change.

 other direction."

The problem is if we swim over there we’ll have to wait half an hour before we can
go back

I told you to book the one with two S's.
Just make sure you don't swim back for at least half an hour afterwards.
It’s probably covered in ants.
It’s tempting, but I bet the property taxes are insane..

What would Hansel and Gretel do?
We could do worse, the island behind us is made of broccoli.
Well, I guess it's a desserted island.
I finally understand the distinction between 'desert' and 'dessert'.
Let's call it Desserted Island.
Any way you look at it, it’s still a desserted island.
Sure,but then you'd have to wait 30 minutes before you swim back.
Remember we have the better view.
No Way! Remember "Hansel and Gretel"?
I knew not taking those swimming lessons would come back to haunt us.
Must be a typo.
At least we're on the healthy island.
Those sharks are clever devils...good bakers, too.
A dessert island, of course.

But ours is in good taste...
Every time I go on a diet, something like this happens - every time!
No, that’s Confectionary Cay. Dessert island is just a common spelling error.
*This* is why spelling is important.

I understand, but common sense suggests we wait and see if it’s still there tomorrow.
That’s strange.  I see three candy canes.
But if you were over there, you'd be wanting coconut water.
Just remember to wait thirty minutes before swimming back.
One has two esses, one has two asses.

But only on a special occasion.
Sure, it seems better, but do you know what they pay in property taxes??
Since when did Mary Ann and Ginger learn how to bake?
No we are not near the sandwich islands.

gentrification

You can always tell when the Carnival Cruise ship is about to arrive
Sure, it looks less like a flying saucer with all that on top, but it's still them, Thomas, and we won't fall for it.
Seems like a cruel joke to place Desserted Island so close to Deserted Island.
So, there were survivors from the Good Ship Lollipop after all.
If only we weren't dentists.
You're right, a dessert island would have been better.
Where's a chute or ladder when you need one?
Go ahead if you want,but it never tastes as good as it looks.

Desert island, dessert island -- we missed it by that much!
We’re on Weight Watchers Island
Yeah, desert island and dessert island, ha-ha, I get it. But now I’m expecting a voice-over encouraging us to switch auto insurance.
So, I misspelled, “dessert”.  How did you get here?
I would, but I finally made it back to my high school weight.
Looks like we're getting our just desserts.
I think it's a trap.
One more dessert island joke and I'm going to kill you.
But we'll swim off the calories on our way back.
I'm pretty sure it's a misspelling.
If you sing "Big Rock Candy Mountain" one more time, I'll kill you.
I don't have to out swim the shark, I just have to out swim you
Damn. Big Sugar is everywhere!
The swim should offset the calories.
It happens when a mapmaker misspells desert island.
Legend says it was the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop.
I feel like we're not thinking big enough with our prayers.
Don't go Hansel!
I can't swim and you're a diabetic, so let's change the subject...
Aw, you remembered my birthday.
But I DID type in ‘dessert island!’!
I tried to tell you. It's location, location, location.
We really whiffed the landing on this one
That must be the Dessert Isle.
Funny the difference an "s" makes...
What would be the point? We have no milk.
If I were seeing a mirage, that's not what I would see
Tempting, yes, but what do we do when our pants don't fit anymore?
It's like Candy Land and Fantasy Island had a baby.
The shark can't eat BOTH of us!
I imagined the same thing my first week here.
I told you if anyone can the candyman can
Oh, I know it is a mirage...but so is 'democratic socialism'...
Since we have no idea what day it is,can today be our "cheat" day?
Yesterday it was a blonde.
Why am I not enough?
I just thought of a really sweet spot for our next vacation
No, the Mirage is a big hotel in the middle of Las Vegas. That is an island covered with candy!
And you thought it was important to pick the island with shade!
I saw the sharks setting it up last night
I really wasted that genie wish.
If only we hadn't gotten shipwrecked during Lent.
I don't want to ruin my dinner.
I wished to be on a desserted island, what'd you wish for?
But do they understand the cavity of their situation?
My ex told me that it will end with me getting my just deserts!", but this is cruel
I'm heading over there on my 'cheat' day
The question, as I see it, is do we want to die of starvation or diabetes?
This is the year we learn how to swim!
Who knew spelling mattered in making a wish
Thats a real dessert Island
Either it's a mirage, or there's an old lady over there waiting to push us into her oven. Either way, I say we stay put.
I'm confused--which is a desert island and which is a dessert island?

It can't hurt just to look.
We could swim or wait for the next Sugar Plum Ferry...
It can be our cheat day.
Dessert island. Those sharks are pretty clever.
I'm more in the mood for a salad.
Well we've stripped this one of all vegetation.  Room for dessert?
You seriously want to wait for your cheat day?
Yeah, but think of the calories you'll burn swimming there and back
At least we have company. That one is completely desserted.
But think of the calories we'd burn swimming to it.
I didn't think I had to spell it out when I said row for the desserted island.
Why couldn't we land on a dessert-ed island?
I don't know about you, but I say screw the American Dental Association recommendations.
Swe-e-eet!
Now that, my son, shows you the power of delusional thinking!
Well, the upside is that we have a really sweet view.
I've been over there. It's all plastic.
It isn't about 'yielding to temptation', I can't swim.
Okay, if we use the cupcake paper as a boat 
and the candy canes as oars...
Don't let it fool you - I'll bet from over there, this place will look pretty good, too.

She was a good ship, the Lollipop.
It must be Palm Sundae.
What luck. You can’t swim and I’m a diabetic!
No, no. We are on the desert island. That is the dessert island.
Knowing what happened to the Good Ship Lollipop and not being able to tell anybody is just a really special type of torture, ain't it Jimmy?
This is all tied in with our inability to make good choices
Yeah, but we've got a tree.
If you knew how to spell, this never would have happened.
Dude, did you ever do acid?
There’s no room, no shade and a lot of empty calories.
Why couldn’t we have landed on the dessert island instead of the desert island?
It's not the calories that will kill you, it's the mirage.
These islands all look better from a distance.
Desert island, dessert island...what difference does it make?
Theoretically, how much would we tip the delivery guy?
ready to swim back?
That'd be a sweet spot for a vacation.
Oh , hell. My insulin went down with the ship.
We die from starvation or we die from diabetes. Odds or evens?
Too bad you didn't know the difference between "desert" and "dessert" when you made that wish...

Why did we have to get the desert island?
I told you we should have grabbed our insulin before the ship went down.

You know, if we swim over there we would technically burn off the calories...

It's amazing the difference one letter can make.
I see we got our just desserts.
Of all the things to give up for lent, I had to choose swimming!
Sam, that is not what you think it is, it’s just a tropical illusion.
Yes, I see the candy-canes and cupcakes, just like last week I saw the picnic table and the guy grilling steaks and the week before that I saw...
The sharks must think we’re eight-year-olds.
Looks like sugar infested waters.
Try not to think about it.
Yeah man, we’re surrounded by chocolate milk too.
Oh, them? Survivors from the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop.
Really, you’re a dentist too?
Yeah, but think of the ant problem over there.
Yeah, seems nice, but they probably have ants.
You're right. We should have asked for a dessert island..
Do you think they have bacon?
Sure looks like a dessert island from here
I didn't realize a dessert island was an option.
With our luck there's a gummy shark between here and Candy Island.
Holy cow! A dessert island.
We get one wish, and, as is now apparent, a genie who cannot spell.
Let’s just appreciate where we are.
We'd only be able to skinny dip on the way there.
So the travel brochure really didn't sugarcoat it."
Dare we hope for The Good Ship Lollipop?
Why didn’t we end up on a dessert island?
Okay, I believe. Could you visualize a boat?
Being Catholic prepared me for this.
Is today a cheat day?
Oh, I thought you said it was a D-E-S-E-R-T-E-D island.
One more 's' and we could have been stranded on the Dessert Island.
And then I said ... 'Swim? For cryin' out loud, we live in Kansas! Why should I waste my time learning how to swim'?...
Most  tempting mirage since the sunning girls yesterday.
That one's for people who want to be alone on a dessert island.
I’ve heard that’s the place where young people with college degrees have good paying jobs
When the president tweeted about buying his own desserted island, I assumed it was just a typo.
I wish we were marooned on the desserted island.
Mom was right--we should've learned to swim.
No, I said “get your own DESERTED Island”!!
We should see if we can get an upgrade.
You'll probably survive the sharks, but the cholesterol will kill you.
Of course I can swim, but I'm finally down to my ideal weight.
Disagree with his motives all you want, but you have to admit - the sea monster's disguises are getting much better.
Were they there before we ate that shellfish?
If I spelled my wish correctly, that's where we'd be.
Ah...the elusive Desserted Isle
Someone misspelled 'desert island'
But we got Wi-Fi.
How many calories in a mirage?
I bet the fish swimming around that island are Swedish.
Bro, we need a sugar plum ferry.
Guess I picked the wrong week to give up sugar.
That cupcake has sailed.
It’s a dessert island.  You can go, but not till after dinner.
I'm staying here.  The wifi's better.
I swore you said deserted island.
Remember: coconuts are the healthy alternative.
We'd only get fat & regret it.
And you said sharks were dumb.
Honey, want to go out, just for dessert?
I think you call it a desserted island.
Yes, but we’d have to wait 30 minutes before we swam back.
I closed on this island after the realtor said he'd sweeten the deal.
Well, today is my cheat day.
That's the last time I'll trust Google Earth.
Good thing we saved room for dessert.
What do you think will get us there quicker, a chute or a ladder?
It’s times like this I really wish you weren’t a dentist.
The wreckage from The Good Ship Lollipop.
How’d you know it was my birthday?
I could never live in a place that's so much about image.
Yeah but I bet it's all made with palm oil.
So sorry hon, I always get desert and dessert mixed up!
Ok, great, but where's the marshmallow sky?
We should have paid the all-inclusive rate.
Talk about a fat chance.
It was a good ship.
I don't know, maybe it's not a trap.
I mean, we could swim to it but I'm still going to eat you.
Would you rather die of cavities or starve to death
That's some serious eye candy!
I'd rather be on a dessert island than a deserted island.
What time do you think they open?
You’re the one who wanted a vegan, no sugar, gluten free vacation.
I love a good mirage at dinner time, don’t you?
Now I'm depressed.
Remember when you said a ship would be the sweetest thing you could ever see?
it must be your mirage kev, my mirage would have tequila and naked women
You'll burn some of it off in the swim back.
Forget it.  I don't think any of those desserts would go with fish.
Will the sharks stop at nothing?
These pop-up shops are everywhere.
Did the brochure say “desert” or “dessert”?
Okay, I got one. If you were stranded on a dessert island...
We should swim for it right now, before they build the wall.
You know, I'm actually more of a savoury type, myself
Happy Birthday, George.
We should've gone to the desserted island
But then you would look over here and dream of coconuts.
I'm going to wait until after dinner.
Just like my mom to keep the sweets out of reach.
Yeah, but a real island wouldn't be moving toward us.
Imagine seeing a dessert island way out here.
Welcome my friend to middle-class island. Where what you see is what you will never get.
Remember that time you said that you’d rather die than eat another carb?
So, the genie gives us three wishes...and before I can even think, the wife and kids use them all!
I don’t care what you were planning to give up for Lent.
Sure Hansel. What could go wrong? Let's swim over.
I think Gene Wilder was way better than Johnny Depp.
Aye, she was quite the good ship, the Lollipop.
My biggest regret is never learning to swim.
I didn’t know the Good Ship Lollipop was a submarine.
Is that my mirage or yours?
How about today? Is today a cheat day?
It's amazing the difference an extra 's' can make.
They're just desserts. Just not your just desserts.
That's the dessert island.
Too bad about your insulin.
And to think we used to live there.
We came so close to being stranded on a dessert island.
When we signed up for Temptation Island, I was expecting supermodels...
I wish we’d noticed that before eating the only guy that knew how to swim
That's my kind of desserted island
One s.   One lousy s.
All those years playing Candyland with my kids has finally paid off.
I spy with my eye something that starts with C.
No.  I would go there on our vacation, but it doesn't exist; and neither do you.
I just hallucinate food and I gain weight.
That? Blame auto-correct.
We could swim over, but we'd have to float back.
Just our luck, another desserted island.
It's a desserted  island ....
Just exactly, what was in that last coconut, you gave me earlier?
You laugh, but since I moved them over there, I've lost 8 pounds!
I'm starting to think that sea level rise will eventually affect my way of life.
Really? Dessert on a deserted island?
We could rationalize it with the swim.
Screw the sharks- I think...you should go for it.
If it helps, remember those are empty calories.
I think your weed was laced.
Nah, I’ll wait for a burger and fries mirage.
Unfortunately, these waters are snack infested.
There, but for want of an extra "s", go you and I.
Chocolate syrup's a bitch to swim in, man ...
I think I'll stay here - sticky hands and sand are the WORST!
We won't be able to swim back for half an hour.
I've always heard good things about the South Beach Diet.
Actually, maybe we're its hallucination.
Dude, don’t do it. You know we’re outta toothpaste.
I have more of a savory palate anyway.
Let’s seek asylum
You'd seriously choose death over gluten?
I wish we were desserted not deserted
It's about time the dessert tray arrived.
Ever wonder what it would be like to live on a desserted island?
I thought you said it was a dessert island
I told you to check the spelling before booking.
This time you swim over and see if it's real.
Alright, is that your hallucination or mine?
If I knew I would be trapped in a classic cartoon cliché I would rather it had been in a bar.
I thought Mar-a-lago was bigger...
How far do you think we can get on one of those mints?
I just REALLY am in the mood for pizza.
Sorry, Gary. I'm diabetic, so I'm still going to have to eat you.
Lesson learned:  When the genie says submit your wish in writing...always use spell check.
Beware reefs bearing gifts.
That's probably what we look like to them.
As mirages go, it’s not bad.
I told you to pick desserted island.
My travel agent hates me.
It's farther away than it looks.
Let me remind you, we don't take kindly to desserters on this island.
That cake’s gotta be stale”
“Yeah
Yeah, it looks sweet from here.
Yeah, I thought about it too, but then I'd just want something salty.
Now that’s Eye Candy
Remember when it was only a board game?
That Great British Baking Show really gets around.
What'd you put in that joint?
You think it could be a desserted island
She's a nice witch, but she eats kids.
I misread the ad. I thought the island would be deserted, not desserted.
I stand corrected. There is such a thing as a dessert island.
Just be sure to wait an hour before you come back.
It's where people who can't spell 'desert' end up.
Obviously bait.
I'm more of a savory person."
So are we on the one with one or two S's?
My hallucinations used to involve beatiful women, but I like this one more now.
Two reasons.  I’m watching my carbs, and I can’t swim.
Don't get too excited, it's all vegan.
Sweet, a dessert-ed island!
Must be a dessert island?
OK, desert island, dessert island. You pick.
I've got this.  I'm level 3047 in Candy Crush.
TripAdvisor DID call it "a pretty sweet deal."
Guess that's what eye candy looks like!
It would spoil our dinner...
That's where The Good Ship Lollipop went down.
Trust me, we're better off here on Insulin Island.
In many ways it is the most highly evolved and patient sea predator ever.
Now that's my type of desserted island.
What a difference one more “s” makes.
This time try holding it above the water when you swim it back.
Do you still think spelling doesn’t matter
The sand does look
sweeter on the other side.
You've become delusional, Bob.  All I see is two palms and a pile of rocks.
It's always a surprise when your mind goes places your body can't follow.
Good thing we landed here -- that stuff'll kill ya.
Next time you book a vacation on your phone, do me a favor and turn off autocorrect.
The Good Ship Lollipop should be along any time now.
Swimming over is a piece of cake.
That's the second empty calories mirage this week.
If you're having second thoughts, I'm a dentist.
They say Oprah lives there and it’s mostly cauliflower.
I guess being pre diabetic doesn’t mean much now.
As a dentist, I may feel more useful there.
Just stay here. Last week it was cocktails.
You're right, I do deserve a cheat day.
Sometimes it seems like God is really just playing games with us.
They say it was run by a guy named Wonka.
If the sharks don't get you, diabetes will.
Somewhat ironic, being shipwrecked on the Good Ship Lollypop …
So glad we chose the low carb deserted island package.
I still think it's strange we're delusional with the same sweets.
So when you typed 'dessert island' into your GPS, did you spell it with one 's' or two?
It's only one "s" away.
Just my luck, stranded with a dentist.
If you decide to go, would you mind bringing me back a slice of cake?
If it weren’t for that darned Autocorrect, I’d be there right now.
You're thinking about deserting me, aren't you.
Damn autocorrect put us on the wrong island.
It's either death or give up my new year's resolution.
But what if I'm right?
I said dessert island, not desert.
Come on, what's so bad about diabetes?
This time the grass may actually be greener.
Oh, look, dessert on an island. If only there was an obvious joke I could make.
Not until you finish your palm tree.
Just our luck to be trapped on a deserted island, not the desserted island.
The islands I fantasize about these days are heaped with scrambled eggs, crispy hash browns and those maple flavored sausages.
I would just walk over there, but I don't think this Jell-O would hold me.
Dang! Just missed the dessert island
Really?  Well I like to pretend I see pretty women reclining and drinking champagne.
I don't mind the hallucinations so much.  I just wish my subconscious mind would throw in a salad every once in a while.
I said swim toward the dessert island, not the desert island.
We should have taken the Good Ship Lollipop....
Let's get off this desert island and get on that dessert one.
Sorry, I thought it was a typo.
You say “hallucination” like it’s a bad thing.
I say we go for it.  Just a short swim, and we could be stranded on a desserted island.
Nah, processed sugar will kill you.
I don't remember Candy Land being this challenging.
Sorry. I thought we'd be safe from temptation out here.
He used to build erotic sand mermaids to torture me until he found out I was gay, then somehow he figured out I was diabetic.
I mean, it's got to be a trap.
Remind me -- what day is our cheat day?
It must be a dessert island.
If only I’d learnt how to spell “dessert.”
I told you to request the desserted island.
It’s a deserted island
We can do better.
I swear to god, if you sing, "Lolipop" one more time, I will feed myself to the sharks.
You're hallucinating again - I see two ears, two eyes a nose and  a row of teeth!
There was a ferris wheel in the brochure.
Resist, Jim. Swimsuit season is year-round for us now.
Sure it's tempting, but eventually we would just crash again.
No shade...No thank you!
It wouldn't kill us to have a cheat day.
Did you know one sugar donut takes two days off your life?
I think the sharks have us figured out.
As long as it keeps floating closer I'm actually ok with it being a mirage....
As far as being marooned goes I'm glad we went traditional.
Calorie High may call you.
Candy Land looked a lot bigger on the map.
No, I said it's a desert island.
It's a Dessert Island. Get it?
Well, let's finish this last tree, and we can swim to dessert.
Next year, I say we go all-inclusive.
Better an empty stomach than empty carbs.
Maybe the remains of the good ship lollipop?
It's a shame about the Good Ship Lollipop...
I don't care if there are Sharks. If you Really love me you'll swim over there and get me some cake."
It gives new meaning to name, desserted island.
And I thought sharks weren't that smart.
Say 'dessert island' one more time and I'll drown you in this ocean of syrup"
I think I saw a cartoon like this once, and I didn't think it was funny then either.
They're probably just as unhappy as we are.
Do you think it's the hunger or the acid?
Funny. Always thought I'd be more of a hot chick hallucinator.
There's two esses in "dessert." Once again, you've misspelled us into catastrophe.
After a week, it stops looking like a woman.
Everything I want as always just out of reach.
I knew the ocean was filling with junk...but junk food?
Could you please stop pointing out the irony of our being on a "desert" island?
She’s right, though, I’ll never again misspell desert island.
Let’s go for it. The swim over and back will burn up the extra calories.
Dude, if you call that a sweet spot one more time, I'm going to vote you off the island.
It's either starve to death or get diabetes.
If the sharks don't kill you, the gluten will.
But we've got fiber
Yelp reviews are like 'meh.'
If only we had landed on the desserted island. . .
Survivor: Candyland
Swimming lessons are a waste of time, you said.  Who needs to be able to swim nowadays, you said.
Hey, at least we are not desserted like those people over there.
Sure it is delicious, but you can't live on it.
I try to avoid highly processed foods.
A few years ago, sure, but now that kind of thing is just a distraction.
Dude .... sweet view
Must be survivors from the good ship lollipop
These sharks are smarter than I thought.
I'm giving up sweets for Lent.
Just missed a dessert island by that much!
At least we have shade.
We can't both be hallucinating, right?
We're so lucky we washed up on the healthy island
I should have checked the spelling more closely before I booked our reservations.
It would be nice... but we have a shade tree!
I'm guessing it's from The Wreck of  the Good Ship Lollipop...?
Then again, I'd miss the coconuts.
Do you think that's what they meant when they said we would be receiving just desserts?
We used to trade our coconuts for their candy, but now we’re in a tariff war with them.
The downside of peyote.
For the last time, it's dessert island, not desert island.
I know it’s a mirage, but I still want to go.
The property tax is the clincher.
Let's go. It looks dessert-ed.
I’ve always wondered what it would be like to live on a dessert island.
You can go but I'm not fallin' for that old shark trick.
Just think, if you knew how to swim, you’d be overweight
I wouldn't bother. They don't even use real cream.
Desert or dessert, the ultimate question.
What?? You don’t see it?
The cannibal on that islet is also a pastry chef. Very clever.
Why couldn't we have been stranded on the dessert island?
I'm never playing Candyland stoned again
Is that a desserted island or what?
Ever hallucinate a typo?
At least, we've got shade.
How many calories will we burn on the way?
Wait, your telling me it's been there the whole time!
At low tide you get the gluten-free selection.
Do you want to get one and split it?
Maybe we'll be rescued by the Good Ship Lollipop!
You go. I don’t want to ruin my appetite.
The sharks in these waters are extremely clever and resourceful.  Last week it was women in bikinis."
Yup, global warming. It used to be Rock Candy Mountain.
And to think all that separates us is an "S."
Just be patient. Tomorrow is our cheat day.
I had hoped for more from the season finale.
Man, one S makes a lot of difference.
I guess flotsam from the Good Ship Lollipop
There it is! The wreck of the Good Ship Lollypop!!
We could have visited Candy Land, but oh no, you wanted a desert island getaway.
Too bad we just ate.
I guess you're right. It's dessert island after all.
Guess we missed the boat.
Too bad it's Lent.
Sure, it looks good, but that swim is no piece of cake.
Are you sure you can't see the blonde in the skimpy bikini lying on deck chair?
The next time I book our island vacation, remind me to use spell check
The Diet Island sucks
Don't even think of it. The sharks put it there.
What would you bring to a dessert island?
I don't know, I still kind of like ours.
Sometimes I feel like we landed on the wrong breast.
We're in luck. It's one of the Sarah Leeward Islands.
Next time ask the travel agent for a dessert island.
If only we’d washed up on the dessert island instead!
The swim back will burn off the sugar.
You understand that consuming those will shorten our life expectancy, don't you?
I dunno...doesn't seem worth it without the glass of milk.
If we go for it, do you think we'll get our just deserts, or just desserts?
Your continual humming of Sammy Davis Jr.'s ' The Candy Man Can' is giving me a hallucinations."
We’d need a sweet ride to get over there
Do you see what I see?
Big deal! Just another dessert island.
Oh, wow!  It's a dessert island!
My mirage has a sense of humor today.
I say it's a highly decorated Portuguese man-o-war
Now that wasn't there yesterday."
As you typed in our destination, I told you there was another s.
They told me in dental school there would be days like this.
Just our luck we're on the DESERT island...
Larry, there’s a time and there’s a place to talk about New Year’s resolutions...
We look just as tasty to them.
Now it's just mocking us.
Mirage or not, I've gained five pounds just looking at it.
But you have to admit, the coconuts were pretty good.
A desert island or a dessert island, that is the question.
I was hoping for the land of milk and honey, but castaways can't be choosers.
We should've upgraded to the all-inclusive package.
Too bad we didn’t bring our suits.
Know what? I just don't know if I have yet another damn kids party in me.
I’ve always dreamed of living on a dessert island.
It's a pretty sweet island.
I'm just saying some puns are best left unspoken.
Reminds me of a woodland cottage I visited when I was a kid.
I didn't believe global sea levels were rising until I saw the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
So it IS possible to be stranded on a dessert island.
We're so lucky to have found this 100% organic, non-GMO, Paleo friendly island.
Is it just deserts or just desserts?
I wish I'd persevered with swimming lessons.
Oh look! Its America.
I’d swim over, but those are gummy shark infested waters.
If there was ice cream I'd consider it.
Ironic. Childhood game meets iconic New Yorker cartoon.
Well we better start swimming, because your head's beginning to look like a brownie.
WE'RE SAILORS, you said. 
REAL SAILORS DON'T NEED TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM, you said.
Don't be fooled, it's protected by Gummi Bears.
If only we had The Good Ship Lollipop.
Next time, let’s go all-inclusive.
Somewhere out there my mother is waiting to ask if I really think I need that cake.
What a difference a letter makes
Apparently spellcheck doesn't work in dreams.
I think I like the Hula Girl hallucination better.
I understand, but I think it’s important to be satisfied with what you have.
Remember Hansel and Gretel?
I just want some sushi.
Are you nuts? Haven't you ever read Hansel and Gretel?
Our last wish and you have to misspell dessert!
I don't know---looks like a lot less shade.
I thought you said "dessert island."
Oh, just for once, Claire, let the diet go.
It's not 'between meals' if it takes all day to get there.
I'm more a 'savoury' person.
Gene Wilder. You?
And to think, we could be on a dessert island.
I told you my fantasy was to be stuck on a desserted island.
It’s a dessert mirage, John, and it’s much worse than a desert mirage.
OK -- but I still see women drinking beer.
Probably too many kids over there.
You know it's two palm trees 
and a couple of guys just like us, right?
You go, you gorge, you wait a half hour, and then you swim back.
It's a mirage.  We've been living on sushi for weeks.
The sharks out here never stop trying.
I said deserted island.
No. See, this one is "deserted". No extra "s".
It's just as well; neither of us has a toothbrush.
One ‘s’ makes a helluva difference.
The swim should cancel out the calories
Yeah, but the wi-fi is lousy.
If only there was a root beer float.
I would, but I didn't bring my toothbrush.
It's more fun than Easter Island
No point, it looks deserted.
We've been dessert-ed.
I saw sharks in the water, but now I'm thinking they're gummy sharks.
The Ancient Mariners called it Diabetes Island.
I had no idea stranded on a dessert island was even an option.
I always knew dessert island was more than just a typo.
What lousy luck--we could've washed up on a dessert island.
It’s our just desserts.
Well I think we’ve earned a cheat meal by now.
We're deserted. We could be desserted.
No, can't be.  New Yorker editors would have caught that typo.
I was seriously hoping you could swim.
Why couldn't we have ended up on a dessert island?!?
But no, you wanted the no-frills island vacation!
I'm not scared, I just don't have a toothbrush.
Of all the desert islands cartoons clichés, in all the world, we had to wash up here.
The sharks are getting smarter every day.
Francine was delicious, but I have a hankering for something sweet.
I knew we should have upgraded.....
The Candy Man can.
It evokes The Grass is Greener... but with the threat of drowning.
Is it worth burning our skin in the hot fudge to get there?
I say here—that island is desserted.
The Rockettes. Why? What do you see?
It's really my fault--when I was seven I wished for this.
I said the DESSERT island would be fun.
Just deserts, you say?
I don't know, how do they pair with fish?
Learning to swim would've been sweet.
I've got a craving for something salty.
It's the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop.
'Let's take a cruise, Hansel,' you said. 'What could possibly happen?' you said.
We will totally burn off the calories when we swim back.
Did you run spell check when you booked our reservations for Dessert Island?
Maybe it’s a typo, but desserted was a common misspelling in the days before autocorrect.
Our island is deserted, theirs is desserted.
At least we have a choice: death by starvation or death by diabetes.
Hal, is this your mirage or mine?
I don't know Mark, I feel more like chips and guac.
It's all artificial. We have a tree.
My bad.  When I saw 'dessert island' on the map, I thought it was a typo.
I think it is a trap. Looks all artificially sweetened.
So it WAS the Good Ship Lollipop that went down in last night’s storm.
Let's wait for our cheat day
Don’t worry, we’ll work the calories off on the way back
That other island looks pretty sweet.
On the other hand, the swim over would burn off the calories.
Well we’d burn off the calories swimming over, right?
You said if we built this people would come.
Bring me back one with sprinkles.
But how do you KNOW it's a mirage?
And I thought “Dessert Island” was a typo.
Maybe we should consider a cheat day.
I may have not proofread the email to the travel agent
No, you’ll ruin your appetite for Dinner Island.
Please don't try to sugar-coat our situation.
Finally, I have imagined something that might possibly be tastier than you.
Wow! Who'd think fermented coconut milk could do this.
After you do your chores.
I always forget.  Are we stranded on the ‘desert’ or ‘dessert’ island?
I can't believe I'm stuck here with my dentist!
I still don't get why you swam to THIS island.
Just my luck. Stranded here with my dentist.
Where's the beef?
Really? Wish I had your imagination. I'm just seeing the old cliche turkey and all the trimmings.
It takes will power.
Sweet dreams are made of this....
You leave out one lousy ‘S’!
Spelling and pronunciation are vital. It thinks it's a dessert island.
Aww, you remembered.
You wished for candy?
Cavities, diabetes or starvation ? At least we have choices!
Just as well, my insulin went down with the ship.
Kind of ironic that both of us are diabetic.
I heard it’s for “Survivor”, the pastry chef season
Trust me. It’s time to eat gluten again.
I don’t see it.
As hallucinations go, this is a great one.
What is the one thing you’d want with you if you were stranded on a desserted island?
It used to be 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain', before global warming.
I’m finally at my perfect weight so it’s a good thing that I can’t swim.
What if they're wrong about sugar?
Are you sure those last painkillers were advil?
I know it looks good, but trust me, it's all coconut.
Surviving over there would be a cakewalk.
I try to avoid the candy isle.
Just empty calories.
It was settled in 1934 when Shirley Temple ran aground.
Still think those swim lessons are 'dumb and unnecessary?'
We finally found the world’s most dessert-ed island!
We should have specified 'desserted.'
The question is...do the sharks want us as much as we want candy.
It was the good ship Lollipop until it sank.
Exactly. That's where Louis Stevenson wrote "Dessert Island".
I'll pass.  I'm still queasy from eating this island.
Five dollar delivery fee? Forget about it.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice.   I’m just uncomfortable with the gentrification.
At least we don't have an ant problem
Spelling Bee Champion, eh?
Regardless, it’s all just empty calories.
So. What do you want to talk about?
Hopefully we'll burn it all off swimming back here.
The bright side is that we’ll burn all the calories on the swim back
I'd rather have savory.
I just don't want to have to deal with the ants.
Look,Hansel,we fell for that trap once before and ended up with a homicide charge to answer for.
On second thought I’d prefer diabetes to rising sea levels.
That genie is just trolling us now
And here I thought it was only a board game...
Yeah, but the sweets are always sweeter on the other side.
You think they need any shredded coconut?
We're fine as long as the iced caps don't melt.
Why'd we have to have the cartoonist with spell check?
I would rather DIE than eat processed sugar.
I guess this is better than being stranded AND getting diabetes.
Only a fool would embrace socialism when we enjoy all this freedom.
Is it a mirage or a merengue?
Life sucks.
Nice One! My turn. I wish it was a huge flat screen TV.
It’s called the North Beach Diet. If you survive the swim, you can eat whatever the hell you want...

I always thought "dessert-ed island" was just a typo.
This is a diabetic's version of Hell, right?
This is why diabetics should avoid hallucinogens.
The quality of our mirages has improved.
Sure it’s sweet, but we’re iconic.
Great, now I'll be stranded AND diabetic.
No, it's not a mirage, just another dessert island.
And not a stitch of clothes! What do you see?
This temptation island diet is tough.
Want to hop over to the dessert island?"
"Nah, it's clearly a typo.
How many calories do you suppose we can burn off swimming there and back?
I always thought it was spelled ‘deserted’.
'Desert, dessert.' Big difference.
Tough call. Death by starvation or diabetes?
I don't like the way they're looking at us, Carl.
You couldn’t hallucinate a comely waitress with the dessert cart?
And a friend?  And a boat?
That's mine, so it's your turn to hallucinate.
I always hallucinate on day 3 of the keto diet.
This makes clear the important difference between desert and dessert.
Here comes the dessert tray- let's split something!
Honestly, I'm more of a Chutes and Ladders guy.
Don't worry. We'll burn it off swimming back.
Salt. Fat. Sugar. Definitely from USA.
I must be hypoglycemic Joe.  I think I'm seeing a dessert island.
...but you just know the cake has a soggy bottom.
Is it correct to say "desserted' island?
I sure wish we had ended up on the dessert island instead.
When will you realize that dessert has two "s's" and not one?
At least we've got a sweet view...
I just look and I gain 10 pounds!
They say the Good Ship Lollipop went down in these parts.
Either that's a mirage or we're suddenly in a Far Side cartoon.
Why couldn't we have landed on a dessert island?
Just our luck. We could have been marooned on a dessert island.
“No, it’s not your imagination, it’s your grammar.”
Sure we could, but it would spoil our supper.
Why couldn't we get stranded on the dessert island?
Sure, it looks like a good idea now, but you'll feel terrible in the morning.
They did try to offer us a sweeter package, Jim.
Just our luck to have washed up on the desert island instead of the dessert island.
Maybe I should have just wished for a rescue ship.
I wish we were stranded on the dessert island.
You go on ahead. I’m more of a ‘savory’ person.
Until now, I never realized how important an s could be.
Really?  I see Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence.
I believe those are the Dutch West Candies.
I won’t tell if you won’t.
Well, at least the realtor wasn't lying about the sweet view.
I hated that game
That's the Pinterest version.
You'll spoil your appetite.
How was I to know that wishes came with spellcheck?
That Lollipop.  She sure was a good ship.
I don't have to swim faster than the sharks.
I just have to swim faster than you.
Still prefer the tropical vibe?
Is it deserted or desserted?
We could get there, if only we had some chutes and ladders.
Hmm...choices, choices: a desert island or a  dessert island?
If the sharks don't get you, the diabetes will.
We'd probably die faster there.
Here me out. The candy canes will work as paddles and I’m pretty sure the donut will float.
If anyone deserves a pass on breaking New Year's resolutions, it's us.
Big Rock Candy Mountain,  post climate change.
But no! You wouldn’t take the upgrade!
If we swim there and back, we ‘ll work off the sugar and carbs.
I was thinking maybe a nine iron.
Given a choice, I'd rather be stranded on a dessert island.
Is that the good ship lollipop or am I hallucinating again?
Let's grab a treat and then wait for the girl mirage to return.
They’re the survivors of the Good Ship Lollipop.
Just our luck to land on the DESERT island, rather than the DESSERT island!
It's a simple plan. Let me spell it out. We leave this desert island, and go to the dessert island!
Well, we have the tree.
It's a common typo mirage.
Candy Crush withdrawal will do that to you.
I'm waiting until Lent is over.
We’re on the wrong desserted island.
Must be American
Could be shark bait.
Mirage or not, I'm going for it.
Talk about a Desserted Island....
That mirage must be yours because mine is wine ,women and song.
Ok ok that’s your fantasy. Now let’s do mine again.
It hasn’t moved in at least twenty minutes.  Maybe we should go for it.
You know, I just don't have the sweet tooth that I used to.
I didn't think they were serious when they said "dessert-ed island vacation"...
What did you expect, The Good Ship Lollipop?
Must be part of the Pacific Ocean garbage patch.
I’m more of a savory guy.
I meant THAT kind of desserted island.
I'd love to, but I have to keep my beach body.
Now THAT'S what I call a "desserted" island! Ha Ha Ha. Am I right? Jeff? Jeffery?
The next time we order a vacation package, we really have to double-check our spelling.
Russian sub?
Sweet view, isn’t it?
I would try but I’m afraid of the Gummi sharks.
Not interested. Swimsuit Season is right around the corner.
Looks tempting but maybe we should wait for Bill to come back.
Now we know what happened to the Good Ship Lollipop.
God, I'm sick of coconut.
That whale will do anything for attention.
You go ahead, I'm watching my sugar.
Amazon's same day dessert tray delivery anywhere on earth is here.
Frankly, I'm more of a savory guy.
Yeah,
 that's where the Good Ship Lollipop ran aground.
Although clearly tempting, they were not sure they should visit Hansel and Gretel Island
Taxes are cheaper here.
That second 'S' makes all the difference.
Honestly I was hoping I’d see naked ladies.
The Realtor did say we were "Candyland adjacent."
Yes, I see the irony - you're diabetic and I can't swim. So, move it.
We're so close I can almost taste it.
It's Weight Watchers new desert island program.
Desert the deserted desert island for the deserted desserts island - say it ten times fast. And then, let's do it.
That wasn't a typo after all.
As mirages go, this one is pretty lush.
Yeah, but think of the ants.
Some dessert islands are better than others.
Would it have killed anyone to strand us on the dessert island instead?
Yeah, I thought I typed Dessert Isle too.
Of course it's a figment of my imagination, but I'm still gonna post it on Instagram.
It's probably just a misspelling.
We could try Uber Eats
Go ahead if you want. I'm waiting for the Good Ship Lollipop
They look great from a distance, but up close it's just seeds and flower petals pasted on to styrofoam shapes.
Lucky we're in their delivery area
Before climate change, it was a sugar candy mountain.
I told you when you booked, "Dessert Island," two s's. But no.
See - a good decorator makes the square footage look so much bigger.
I've heard of desert islands, but never dessert islands.
I’m rethinking my diet.
Is it a trick or treat?
When you said South Beach diet, this isn’t what I had in mind.
It's technically not a homophone.
Looks like Global Warming really hit the North Pole hard...
I call it desserted island.
Ironic that we're on a desert island and that is a dessert island
Let's see who can go longer without thinking about it.
The neighbor's island always looks sweeter.
I say no. They don't have milk.
If we're not rescued soon, I'm going to have to rethink the low carb diet.
It's all yours; I'm waiting for the Good Ship Lollipop.
You're being tested, bro.  Keto is a commitment!
I think we chose the wrong desserted island. This is why spelling is important.
Looks like the Good Ship Lollipop sunk too.
I'm going to wait for the Sandwich Isle.
It’s too commercial for me anyway. Ours is more gritty and real, like the old Times Square
I really don’t think the palm tree will care.
I’d rather be marooned on a dessert island.
Boy, that island sure looks sweet...
Somebody else's island always looks sweeter.
What a different one "s" can make.
You were the one who said "we'll need shade."
Look closely...two of those little tarts are eyes.
And you call this a desserted island?
Let's hope it's a stopover for the Good Ship Lollipop.
I don’t know. What do you think men fantasize about?
As your dentist, sometimes I’m going to suggest things you’re not going to like.
I just don't feel like I have room for dessert.
I wish we were on dessert island
I told you there was a second S
Do you think sharks can bake?
And you thought shade would be more important.
Guess our island isn't as dessert-ed as we thought
So, I have this idea for a boardgame....
Nah... I'm good. I've just started the Keto Diet.
As a mirage it doesn’t have to meet the Dietary Guidelines.
Survivors from the good ship Lollypop
I'll race you!
...are you kidding?  all that processed sugar? no way.
You see it too, right?
You go for it.  I’m cutting back on sugar.
Careful, it's an iced-berg. Most of the sugar is below the surface.
So, we underestimated the sharks.
I wished to be on a 'dessert' island too. Damn spellcheck!
One s makes all the difference in the world.
If we just had a chute and ladders.
I thought you said to swim for the desert island.
It's just one of those "the grass is greener" situations.
We don't have dental coverage.
It's always sweeter on the other side.
S w e e t !
I’m so happy it came in time for your birthday!
Dang auto correct!
It looks like the island is deserted.
Since I started my cleanse everything looks like junk food.
Is it still considered a cheat meal if you haven't eaten in six days?
Okay, so pretend you were stranded on a dessert island...
Really, George? Of all the times not to use spellcheck?
Your right, the view is better from over here.
I liked The Food Network better when they were just on cable.
We were off by one 's'.
We have coconuts, they don't!
So it's just another birthday when you can't quite get my gift right.
If only it wasn’t shark week.
I say we swim for it. What do you think, Gretel?
It's a shame what climate change did to the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I’m diabetic and I can’t swim, so it’s a win-win for me!
The Good Ship Lollipop shipwrecked there.
Don't be ridiculous, it's swimsuit season.
Well, Steve, this year you've really gone overboard for Valentine's Day.
You SERIOUSLY didn't see that one when we landed? SERIOUSLY
I know it's a mirage, but I just like looking at it.
On the other hand, dates are higher in fiber, and the palm fronds provide more shade.
Now look at where your dyslexia has landed us --
I call it the Mediterranean Diet.
I don't know...I've been doing really well with my cleanse
Have we got a chute or a ladder laying around here?
You do realize there's not a dentist in 5,000 miles, right?
You go ahead. I don't want to spoil my appetite.
It's either a misspelling or a mirage.
Brings new meaning to a deserted island
We never should have skipped those swim lessons
'I mean, it's okay. But it's really nothing compared to the Spice Island.'
Do you think the ingredients are locally sourced ?
"We could call it the Mediterranean Diet, but no one will believe us.
Nutritionally we’d still be starving.
Do you think they want to eat us too?
I have a sinking feeling it's not gluten-free.
Some cartoonists just can't spell
Looks like it's either climate change or diabetes that will be the end of us!
Don’t fall for it... the sharks put it there as bait.
Now we just need the Good Ship Lolipop to get us there
Don't blame the travel agent, learn how to spell.
My survival instinct says yes but my love handles say no.
Is that a desserted island?
We probably couldn’t afford the rent anyway.
I said book the 'dessert' island, not the 'desert' island.
Did you wish for a desert or a dessert island?
Good thing the sharks in these waters don't have any teeth
Nah. I'm in the mood for something savory.
I wonder where Savory island is...
Your third item can't be another island.
Yeah, but do you see any shade?
Ya, it’s kinda like
the greener grass thing.
Sure, it's tempting, but it's a short-term fix.
Calories don't count when you're far out into international waters
Just my luck. Stranded and a diabetic!
I can't believe we're stuck here because you can't spell!
Even here I have this feeling that the neighbor’s lawn is greener than mine.

Maby we should wait 'till after dinner.
Personally, I consider 'Dessert Island' to be CBS's most innovative reality series yet.
Damn you, auto correct.
I knew that Atkins Island was the wrong choice.
Sometimes, I just hate being a dentist.
I don't see any chocolate.
But this island had a better Yelp review!
If we go there, we can die from gluttony instead of starvation.
I'm just not into puns, that's all.
Even the mirage seems contrived.
Wrong--I see burgers,fries and a shake.
I bet you will burn all these extra calories swimming there and back
Herein lies the difference between desert and dessert.
I say flotsam from The Good Ship Lollipop.
Honestly, it's for the best. I'm trying to get in shape before the summer starts.
Yeah. That would be sweet.
I'm still full from the buffet.
You go ahead, I'm more of savory guy.
What do you think? Cheat day?”
Nah, if we had washed up there we wouldn't be enjoying our Mediterranean fish diet.
Careful - it's just a lure. If the sharks don't get you, the dentists will.
Hey since I left that place I have lost more than 20 pounds ...
Sure it's a short swim, but it's through syrup
Jetsam from the Good Ship Lollipop?
Let's just leave it as, "The Promised Land."
I say swim. If it turns out to be rock candy we can still use it to break the coconut up.
Every time I think about swimming over there, I remember Hansel and Gretel.
If we start swimming now, we can get there before they start building a wall.

I think it's part of Mar-a-Lago.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm glad we're on the lo-cal island.
Why did I let an English major buy our tickets to a dessert island?
No, I don't see it,either...
Definitely a trap
If we only had shoots and ladders"

Yeah, but the views don’t get much sweeter
The bad news is it's all kale.
Sharks will do anything to get their next meal
Just think, we could have landed on a dessert isle.
Race you for the strawberry.
I had requested the dessert island, but my spelling was off.
Until  right now, I never thought it was that important to learn how to swim...
That's just silly.
Goddamn socialists. At least we have our freedom.
I'm waiting for a low-carb mirage.
Dessert-ed island, they said. Gluten-free option, they said.
The Good Ship Lollipop has to be nearby.
It has sharks written all over it.
For the last time,is it one "S" or two?
I'm a meat and potatoes man myself.
That is a dessert island. We are on a desert island because Hooked on Phonics was replaced with spellcheck.
I always thought it was spelled “desert island...”
I told you we should have bought the deluxe package
It was just one letter
This is the healthy one

I think it's symbolic.
Mirage? No. It’s climate change. That’s Big Rock Candy Mountain.
A desserted island never sounded so good.
I should've booked 'desserted' island instead of  'deserted' island!

I was just one S off.
You’re lucky-you landed on the healthy island.
Too bad we weren't marooned on a Dessert Island.

You realize that I will still cannibalize you eventually.
Even if we get over there, eat everything, and get rescued, we'll still hate our jobs.
Ever wish you'd taken swimming lessons as a kid?
You can argue with the facts all you want. Desert Island is not spelled the same as Dessert Island.
I think it's just a mirage brought on by our carb-free lifestyle.
Desert, dessert. I always get them confused.
No way. It'll rot my tooth.
All things considered, avoiding tooth decay and diabetes doesn't concern me now.
I'm sorry, Fred, I thought it was just a typo on the map.
I ordered it yesterday on Amazon Prime.
My father was a coconut farmer, I’m a coconut farmer, and some day you will be a coconut farmer.

Bob? Don't panic, but you're starting to look like a Twizzler.
It may taste good, but you can't live on it.
Even God can't spell any more.
I doubt the natives are canibals.
Why didn't we opt for "dessert island'?
Maybe later, but now I couldn’t eat another thing.
And then as we swim back, we can work off the calories.
There’s so much you can blame on spell check.
I wonder when we’re going to start hallucinating?
My guess, the food is overpriced and drinks are watered down.
I don't know. Does the term  Trojan Horse come to mind here.
So Harry.... What are you giving up for Lent ?
It’s too bad that I’m a dentist and that you’re a nutritionist.
This is what I get for letting you book our vacation over the phone.
So what will it be then Edward? Starvation or tooth decay?
All because of a silly spelling error!

type one or two?
Having dessert first could spoil our appetites.
The wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop
Dibs on the donut.
Can you swim, Hansel?
Looks like  the Big Rock Candy Mountain is experiencing climate change.
Well, we do get a cheat day...
I've read somewhere that deaths due to sugar intake vastly outnumber deaths due to shark attacks. I believe the safest play here is to wait it out.
Dude, we can't play 'I spy' if you're just going to make things up
Guys look - we're saved! Humans!
Yeah I know, but we have to wait til "cheat" day
No, Monopoly is the most popular board game I don’t understand how Candy Land even popped into your head
The genie couldn't spell.
I can’t.  My cheat day isn’t until Sunday.
I look forward to these hypoglycemic hallucinations , they really breakup the day"
How can we get to the desserted island?
When I agreed, I thought Candy Land was a board game.
They won't last stranded in the hot sun.
I bet ya ten bucks theres a witch in a bikini over there.

Is this acid hitting you, too?
Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time
How does the five second rule apply here?
Do you suppose it could be, "the good ship, lollypop?
So that’s what they mean by dessert island.
I guess we got our just deserts
It sucks to be one consonant away from making it to dessert island.
I am begging you: can you please stop with the “dessert island” jokes?
Yes Bob, it is ironic that if you add an "s" to the middle of "desert" you get "dessert".
Maybe you should swim over there first, Gretel.
No thanks, I'm still trying to keep my beach body
Now, whaddaya say we go fatten you up?
Now is not the time to lecture me about empty calories.
I thought you said "meet me by the candy aisle."
The candy cane means that it must be Christmas Island

I wonder if there are gummy sharks?
Well, at least the view is pretty sweet...
I hear Wonka wants a foothold in the South China Sea...
Trees are overrated.

Meh. I'm more a savory guy.
On the bright side, I'm doing a great job keeping my New Year's resolutions.
Sure, it's probably a hallucination, but if I have to eat one more coconut, I'm going to scream.
Crusoe's birthday already? That year flew.
We can swim over tomorrow, on my cheat day.
You always see the cheesecake on the next island, and never the cheesecake sitting right next to you.
THEY NEED A FLOAT THRU WINDOW.
The last things you want out here are diabetes and rotten teeth.
I hear the old lady who lives there likes to bake.
It's all that's left of the big rock-candy mountain after the great climate-change floods.
I'm telling you, it's the sharks.
I have heard of  "pie in the sky"  but this view "takes the cake"
Hard to believe that adding an 's' to desert makes such a difference.
Have you noticed your hallucinations getting more and more elaborate?
We've definitely entered the hallucination phase of keto.
The sharks do that.
Ok, so our options are either A), i eat you on this deserted island, or B), I eat myself to death on that deserted island.
That’s just the tip of the icecream.
In 1885 the good ship Lollypop hit a coral reef yonder.
Next time I choose the Airbnb.
And that's what's left of the Good Ship Lollipop."
It’s been on the market for years.
So I'm not a good speller! Whoever heard of a genie requiring wishes to be submitted in writing?
That's what I meant when I said I wanted to be on a "desserted" island!
That's not what we ordered!
Somewhere out there there's a pastry chef working without measuring cups.
I'm telling you, the sharks put it there.
Yeah, but are they happy?
But if both of us can see it, how can it be a mirage?
Really? You see a burger and fries there?
On the bright side, we aren’t pre-diabetic.
What could go wrong?"
Yes, better than another mobile phone shop. But still overdone.
You say "desert" I say "dessert".
It's just a hunch, but life seems sweeter over on that desserted island.
I told you the oceans were filling up with garbage.
I always wondered what happens to day-old pastries.
I still think we were right about our zoning decision.
But it doesn't have a tree!
When you said "desserted" island- that's what I thought you meant.
What....You've never heard of a Dessert Island before?
We do get an occasional Swedish Fish, but that's about it.
It's called Trump Tax Cuts Island....looks tempting, but ultimately little guys like you and me end up with a lot of pain.
Tempting yes but it sure looks like a cane mutiny is looming.
Oh! With TWO S’s!
I don't know about you, but I think they're mocking us.
Say, it’s only a fibreglass cake
sailing by on a cardboard sea,
but it wouldn’t be make-believe
if you believed in me.
Is it just me or are we on the wrooooooong island?
Of course. The one time you spell 'desert' correctly.
In retrospect, I’d rather die of type two diabetes."
We're in the wrong cartoon.
Alexa, book me a trip to a dessert island.
There's plenty of nice treats here on the vegan island too
That must be the one I saw in the brochure.
Did The Good Ship Lollipop sink?
You go. I don't want to put back all the weight I lost on the island diet.
Imagine being stranded on a dessert island!
You explore the island. I’ll try to catch a Swedish fish.
This low carb diet makes me see things.
I'll check it out and see if its real. There is no reason for you to come along.
Should we invite them over?
Too bad!  You can't swim and I gave up sweets for Lent.
And to think my greatest dream was always to be stranded on an island alone with you.
Who knew the genie couldn't spell dessert when I made the wish?
Do you think the cupcakes are debating whether they should come here and eat us?
Those desserted islands are the leading cause of castaway obesity."
I don’t care if it is a mirage. 
I’m swimming over!
I don’t want to spoil my appetite.
... I'm still going to eat you Karl, I just don't have much of a sweet tooth.
Yeah, but how many calories would we burn swimming there?
Lucky for us, we got the gluten free island.
You know what they say, a moment on the lips a lifetime on the hips.
So, it's not just a spelling mistake after all...
We're not going to fall for the old Hansel and Gretel trick!
I told you there were two S's when you booked our trip, but you just wouldn't listen.
I told you to grab your insulin.
You go ahead. I’m watching my weight.
Yeah, before the floods that used to be the big rock candy mountain.
But I booked us on the dessert island.
Listen, I've been thinking, this island is getting a bit small for the two of us...
I'm waiting for my cheat day.
What do you say we swim over to Dessert Island after dinner?
No, I clearly said swim to the dessert island!
I see the sharks have upscaled their bait.
I still don’t understand what a homonym is.
Maybe if we declared a state of emergency we could afford to build a big, beautiful bridge.
Those flying saucers will do anything to get attention.
I’m really more of savory guy, anyway
It's a shame, but thanks to global warming, that's all that's left of Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I thought we already got our just desserts.
I'd prefer the "Good Ship, Lollipop."
The only problem will be swimming back
On the other hand, the swimming would count against the calorie gain.....
Yeah, but the view is pretty sweet.
If we knew how to swim, we would die happy!
No, I’m Keto...I see bacon, eggs, and butter.
Feels more desserted today, doesn’t it?
At least ours is all-inclusive
If your not here in the morning, I will understand ."
Who ever heard of a dessert island?
It appears they're baking, too.
A mirage, or just plastic? I'm guessing plastic.
Last week it was entrees
They say it's bigger below the surface.
It looks as though Global Warming has gotten to the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I’d rather die of starvation than of diabetes.
It's just as well. I have sensitivities to imaginary gluten.
And how much did you pay for this desserted island getaway?
Bet it's all past the expiration date!
Are you kidding? I just got beach-body ready.
We seemed to have chosen the wrong island.
As your life coach, therapist and dentist, I advise against it, but hey, what have you got to lose?
Whaddaya say? Do you still have room?
Just think, Gloria, we've discovered an uncharted dessert island
Before global warming that was the Big Rock Candy Mountain
You remembered!
How sweet it is!
Do you think there might be jellyfish?
For once a positive effect of global warming.
Pinch me.
Eh, the whole pun thing kind of puts me off.
The lingerie photo shoot is still #1.
Should we build a wall?
Why couldn’t we have washed ashore a desserted island?!
Dang Spell Check! I know I typed "Dessert Island"!
I thought “dessert island” was a typo
I prefer savory, thanks.
What I'd give to be stranded on a dessert island.
Well, they say the glacé is always greener...
If only we’d been stranded on that dessert island.
I prefer coconuts.
I'd love to, but I've only got one refill left on my Insulin prescription.
All of a sudden I have a craving for double consonants.
they all died from hyperglycemia
apparently the last residents died of diabetes.
If you sing Big Rock Candy Mountain one more time I’ll smack you.
I'm not gonna bother.  I don't see any chocolate.
Yeah, but they're just empty calories.
No one told me that dessert island was an option
It's the downside of being a good speller
I get that the rule is no dessert until after dinner, but we haven't eaten anything in weeks.
Hard to believe that's all that remains of the Good Ship Lollipop.
I'm pretty sure I saw the donut wink at me.
If it looks too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.
Don't bother. It's just empty calories. 
Besides, sharks.
You on a diet?
Can we reconsider the Paleo thing?
Tempting, but swimsuit season *is* just around the corner.
As a diabetic dentist, I find God’s sense of humor disillusioning.
One “S” really matters.
They're just empty calories.
No insulin, they all died
It's the island of unwanted carbs.
Don't worry, we'll burn off the carbs swimming back.
Flotsam from the Good Ship Lollipop
Sure it's tempting but look at all we'd be leaving behind.
Don't dessert me!
It’s “Survivor Candyland”
I should’ve taken those swimming lessons more seriously.
Ooh. Glad I saved room for dessert!
You should see the salad bar!
I told you not to waste your one wish for our old Candyland game
I thought you said we were going to a dessert island.
Looks like we were an S short of a dessert island getaway.
Believe me, I will NEVER mix up "desert" and "dessert" again!
She was a good ship, the Lollipop was.
Damn this Jello Sea.
I'm glad we didn't go for anything so tasteless.
O.K. Just this once.
Another dessert island
I dunno. How many calories do you think we'd burn swimming over?
Its huge mouth is just below the waterline.
Disney is everywhere.
Just a little advice from a lifelong vegan, that crap will kill you.
Sure, we could swim over there. But then we’d feel awful about ourselves the next day.
Aren’t you glad we cut out sugar?
Good stealth design, but the periscopes are a bit too obvious.
Nothing tastes as good as mirages look.
I vote for leaving Low Carb Island.
The sand shark spent all night setting that up for us.
This is why he's Moby-Dick and not Moby-Nice
It's what happens when Titanic meets a Shirley Temple film.
It is the quintessental desserted island.
I'd kill to have all that.
I say it’s more Koons than it is Christo.
Plastic garbage vortex, or the big rock candy mountain?
I knew I should have spell- checked "dessert."
Those sharks really mean to get us this time.
I regret asking for the sugar-free option.
A.  I have been in the sun too long and it's a mirage.
B. The sharks have gotten sophisticated.
And here we are, so close to a desserted island.
We probably shouldn’t have eaten the banana float first.
Our mirages have grown so cliché.
looks sweet over there
It can only be described as a horrid pun.
That’s one sweet island
I really would have preferred the Good Ship Lollipop.
I always pass on dessert islands.
Well, at least it’s not deserted.
The presentation is a little tacky...
We really lucked out. That other island would have ruined my diet.
I don’t like the way they’re looking at us.
No, no. We’re on a desert island, that’s a dessert island.
That's the icing on the cake, Larry
I'm praying it's a loading port for the Good Ship Lollipop.
They’re never as good as they look.
Not much of a dessert man, myself.  I prefer savory.
Why did it have to be the Good Ship Lollipop that crashed?
You see two women? Where are your priorities, dude?
It’s the Galollilopagos island
That’s the real  temptation island!
You go first, I'll let you know if I see any sharks.
Damn, and me with no toothbrush.
I saw some sharks build that last night.
The second s is important.
None of it will taste as good as thin feels.
All I’m saying is, if I’m going to die, I might as well die of diabetes.
The Good Ship Lollypop's surviving crew members wait for rescue on the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
I don’t know.  These coconuts are almost ripe.
I think I'd prefer THAT desserted island.
What if we just don't tell your doctor?
I don’t know if I spelled it wrong, or if my Genie mis-read it, but the bottom line is Dessert Island is over there, and I am here.
They all pair beautifully with coconut.
It's amazing what a single "s" can do to your life.
Maybe I should've swam over to you.
Dessert, not desert.
I have to admit I thought Temptation Island would be different.
Desert","dessert",whoever knew it would make such a difference
I like this place better.Its classic
Obviously a typo.
Stupid autocorrect.
I just don't think anyone would buy a memoir called "Stranded on a Dessert Island."
At least we'll live longer.
Why is our island only deserted?
Nice try dessert shark!
The swim should burn off the calories.
Trick or Treat?
The Good Ship Lollipop"  would have been sufficient.
I understand son, I just feel this island is more authentic and besides, coconut milk is a healthy alternative.
Well, now there's more for us, and the shark is probably full.
I never would have expected  that our final Survivor competition  would be an Atkins diet challenge.
Our coconuts are healthier, son.
At least we're stranded on the "healthy-choices" island.
But what are its tax policies?
I’m more of a savory kind of guy.
I'm afraid I'm starting to hallucinate. You don't see kale, do you?
A little gaudy if you ask me.
Unless there is an insulin island nearby, I suggest we stay here.
I'd rather not, every time we go there I gain ten pounds.
what was the name of that board game we played as a kid?
I didn’t realize Weight Watchers would be so literal.
Yes, they said the rehab is going to be hard.
Dang, at least we got a sweet view.
Now all we need is to survive a sugar crash.
There must be easier ways to explain trade with China to me.
For the next wish, can you please turn off the auto-correct?
I always wondered what happened to the Good Ship Lollipop.
You go, I’m gluten free.
Someday I'll learn to spell "dessert."
I always wondered where the Good Ship Lollipop docked.
I thought the option with the extra ‘s’ was a typo
I don't care if it's a mirage. That's how I met you, isn't it?
I’ve always fantasized about spending time on a desserted island.
Never let a dyslexic book your vacation.
It sure looks sweeter on the other side!
The Good Ship Lollipop stopped there last night.
Yeah, but it doesn't have you
Methinks it be jetsam from The Good Ship Lollipop.
Let's try the desserted island.
How was I suppose to know Desserted Island wasn't a typo?
Sharks? I'm worried about diabetes.
Yeah, but there's like, zero nutritional value over there.
I thought these were desert islands
I know they say "the grass is always greener" but I'm struggling to see the downfall of the other side right now.
You’re right. It wasn’t there yesterday. It must be an ile flottant.
I recommend The tiramisu.
Another one of God's little jokes.
Are we just deserted or did we get our just desserts?
I don't see any bacon, do you??
Even if I could swim, I’m still a diabetic.
Darn gerrymandering!
Are you sure this isn't a board game?
I think we should lay off the LSD.
It's crazy that neither of us can swim.
No, I’m pretty sure it’s not vegan.
There's just no way to know if it's my cheat day.
Yes, you have done some amazing things with fish and coconuts.
But that’s what this one looked like from a distance, too!
Sharks" hell! What about the gluten??
I always wondered why they called them "desserted.
If you had remembered the extra 's', we'd be vacationing on dessert island.
Do you think it's an all inclusive?
Harold and Karen would never mistake desert for dessert again.
It looks much better from a distance.
I left cuz I’m on a low-carb diet.  What about you?
Just another deserted island.
You know, I've been rethinking this whole Paleo thing.
These are a few of my favorite things.
Funny, I once said I'd rather be marooned on a deserted island than play Candy Land ever again...
But is it artisanal?
We need to update the spelling on our GPS.
No way! Refined sugars will kill you.
Either that's a dessert island or my eyes made a typo.
It’s just Fake Food!
Coconuts are much healthier you said.
Not until you finish your dinner island.
That good ship tragically went down somewhere in this area.
Looks like they're going all out for this year's Fyre festival.
Before climate change, it was called Big Rock Candy Mountain.
No, No, I told you to book us on a DESSERT island.
Yes, but were they made in a plant that processes peanuts?
What, no coffee?
That cruise ruined sweets for me.
Dude, if it's just a mirage how come we both see it?
That’s ok. You go. I’m on a diet.
So if I swim butterfly, I'd burn an extra 200 calories?
Nah, you go ahead. I'm really trying to cut down on sugar.
Some get stranded on a tropical island, some on a desert, and some  on a... dessert?
Dessert Island"? Must be a typo
Thi is where a U-Boat sunk the Good Ship Lollipop.
As a third grade teacher, I'm a little conflicted about seeing a dessert island.
Aspartame.
Wish we had a cakewalk
Yup, climate change:  the Big Rock Candy Mountain is almost under water.
You go ahead---I'm running short of insulin.
Do you think there's an island with pizza and beer?
Hypoglycemia can really play games with your mind.
We should have played Candy Land instead of survivor
So that’s what you meant when you said you wanted a taste of paradise
We finally found a diet that seems to work, and now this!
At least, our island is non-GMO, vegan and gluten-free.
If you can keep the sharks distracted, I’ll save you a cupcake.
It's a mirage; they're really fruits and vegetables.
Why'd we have to land on the Desert Island?!
Nah, dream us a boat.
Shall we desert the desert for the dessert?
In retrospect, I'm not sure that choosing 'a friend' as the one thing I would bring to a deserted island was the best choice.
It's gotta be the wreckage of the Good Ship Lollipop!
That’s a sweet view.
Well ,I was fantasizing something a little more nutritious
Just our luck; we didn't land on the Dessert Island
I think they 're from  the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop.
Oh, The difference one ‘s’ can make!
Who knew there was such a thing as a desserted island?
We have two choices- poor nutrition or no nutrition
It's just a typo.
Mirage or meringue either way I’m going for it!
Forget the sharks . . . sugar is the real killer.
I can't help but think this is all just my dentist trolling me.
It's a trap John...
Go ahead. You can swim over but I think they look like antennae.
I picked the wrong week to go carb-free.
"Who was it that said, 'Life is short.  Eat dessert first!'?"
Tell me again why we didn’t opt for the “desserted island” package.
After the Atkins and South Beach tribes fought to a standstill, another group took over.
Sweet view. Pity about the commute, though.
I think it's a trick that looks like a treat
Oh, that's the Good Ship Lollipop's home port.
They're deserters from the Good Ship Lollipop.
What with your diabetes and my gluten allergy.....seriously?
And then what? Die from type 2 diabetes?
Damn, these sharks have an imagination!
Lucky for me I'm a cannibal
I didn't notice that yesterday, did you?
So much for your mirage. Now it's my turn.
I'd like to buy an S.
Think you can learn to swim before they build a wall?
On paper, the difference seems negligible.
I'm pretty sure it's a mirage, not meringue.
That's where the Good Ship Lollipop ran aground.
Sweet view.
Candy is in isle one.  Palm oil is in this isle.
They’re stale
If I'm going to hallucinate about food, I'd prefer Katz's deli.
Isn't it crazy how much difference a single letter makes?
Just our luck: I’m diabetic and you’re watching your weight.
I'm glad we left.
I don’t know about you but maybe it’s time to reconsider this whole Paleo thing.
It's probably a mirage, but how do you explain the smell?
Don't bother. It's all store-bought.
It is clearly a mirage: look at all those empty calories!
Relax...they're probably not kosher for Passover.
Damn spell checker.
This desert island is boring. We should upgrade to the dessert island package.
You're the one who said 'No-one uses travel agents in 2019'.
do you think they're a mirage or we are?
Last week my hallucination was BBQ Island.
Id rather have a Continental Breakfast
So, this is what Hell looks like.
Must be for people marooned on a desert island who can't spell.
If  I didn't love coconuts so much I'd say we go for it!
Terrible time to be diabetic.
I'd prefer a savory mirage.
There's that "Dessert Island" you're always hearing about.
Apparently it's an offshore sugar-tax haven.
Good luck. I've been trying to beat this Candy Crush level for the last nine years.
They call that a dessert island.
I hated candyland
I think our genie had a hearing problem. I really did say "dessert island".
Do you want to go out for lunch?
I'm just saying, as our diet stands, we have room for one cheat day
I had a dream like this once...without you.
Sometimes I wish we were stranded on a dessert island.
We can sail across on The Good Ship Lollipop".
Even Candyland couldn't avoid Climate Change
I think the dessert chef went overboard.
Did you know there are two S's in dessert?
Travelocity autocorrected when I misspelled desert.
If only it were organic.
My luck, I just started going paleo.
The hallucinations are becoming more unhealthy.
Looks good to me, and I'm a dentist.
Is this our just desert?
A mirage? I thought that only happened in the desert.
Don't get excited, it's just a dessert mirage.
No, you go ahead. I'm on a cleanse.
Your inability to spell has really cost us this vacation.
Not until tomorrow; that's my cheat day.
You know you'll just end up ruining your appetite.
You go.  I'm on a low-sugar diet.
Nouveau riche.
As your dentist, I advice against it.
The last thing we need is empty calories.
Sure, but it's just empty calories.
They say Sammy Davis, Jr. used to live there.
I really wish I could swim.
Tell me again. Is it dessert or desert?
Sometimes I’m sorry I gave up carbs
It's just empty calories.
So close, yet so far.
Dessert island. Get it
Big deal. They don't have a desalination plant either.
The frosting is always greener on the other island.
It was the summit of the Big Rock Candy Mountain before climate change.
Not without my toothbrush, Jim.
Too much sugar.  My fantasy island is all carbs and pizza.
Bummer, I thought it was Taco Tuesday.
Is this a climate change issue?
It was a floating-island competition that got out of hand.
Well yeah but I gave up sweets for Lent
Just another example of the importance of spelling.
We should have asked for the dessert not desert island
Did the brochure say desert or dessert island?
Only after we find a dinner island
And you know, 90% of those dessertbergs are under water!
Yeah, it's fun, but parking's a nightmare.
At least we have our insulin.
I'm sure glad I left plenty of room for a desserted island.
The off-axis symmetry really irks me.
Is it election time again already?
Only on my cheat day
I would, but I don't want to ruin my appetite.
Well, what do *you* want to watch?
Empty carbs, dude.
Yet another sign we've received our just desserts.
But if it’s still there on Holy Thursday, I’m doing it.
You'll spoil your dinner Andy......
Did last night's sea urchin taste funny to you?
I say we stay here.  That kind of stuff will kill you.
The Diet Works Only If You Can't Swim
Oh look. Now the Ferguson's have coconut macaroons.
Survivor: Diabetes Edition
This is the best mirage yet!
The ocean is made of soda, but unfortunately I peed in it.
The mainland never looked so sweet.
Which island has two esses?
''Thanks to global warming, that's all that's left of the big rock candy mountain''
Yeah, looks too good to be true.
He said, "Piece of candy? Go for a ride?" and I end up here. What's your story?
That gives a whole new meaning to “desserted island,” doesn’t it?
I think they spelled it wrong.
Is mirage spelt with one 'r', or two?
Have you ever heard the one about the two diabetics stranded on a remote archipelago?
Just our luck... we end up on the wrong desserted island.
Get it? It's a--." "Shut up, Steve."
They came over on the Good Ship Lollipop.
Now that we have both lost some weight, why not?
It's meringue, I mean a mirage.
I can' t swim either.
Reminds me of sex.
You see an island of candy waiting to be gobbled up, and I see a sea monster waiting to gobble us up.
I'd say now's a good time to give up the diet.
You'd think they would have salt water Taffy...
I'm counting carbs, but you should go.
That island looks sweeter than this one!
Carbs. Nothing but carbs.
Chad, we used your last insulin shot yesterday.
I would, but I don’t want to spoil my dinner.
You think it’s sundae tomorrow? Hard to keep track on a dessert island.
Too bad you are on a diet.
...at least it's a sweet view.
I spy with my little eye something that starts with "C".
Do you know how many times I’d have to swim back and forth to burn off just one bite?!
Maybe its my double vision, but I see two S's in that desert
Do you get the feeling that a shark is toying with us?
If you really want to know, I’d try cannabilism before surrendering to processed sugars.
Too bad we couldn't have been stranded on the dessert-ed island.

Sugar is poison, man. Do you want to die?
I also heard they have great healthcare.
My mirages are becoming more complex.
Oh, that? It's the long-fabled 'dessert island.'

We might survive the sharks but not the tooth decay.
Nah - swimsuit season is right around the corner.
Yeah, but we don’t have any milk.
It’s appealing, but it isn’t death by chocolate.
I’m sure it’s just a typo...
It's just a tease to buy a condo there.
I'd never make it across this sea of chocolate
Let’s face it, we can’t have our view and eat it too.
Huh...a real dessert island!
That's what I call a desserted island!
You know what they say: Give a man a Swedish Fish...
No, it’ not the sharks. It’s the gluten.
Looks like Richard Branson is having another bake sale
I’m trying to avoid artificial islands.
Yes, Ms Earhart will be 138 this year but she still enjoys a good party
Do you think they accept credit cards?
It's got to be a trap
It's a piece of cake," Mom said. If I thought she had meant it literally, I would have taken those swimming lessons
Those sharks are diabolical!
On the other hand, it could be real - I mean, it's not something ridiculous like global warming or climate change....
That one looks pretty sweet.
Ah, the lure of empty calories...
And I thought it was just a children's board game.
Trust me. They're in election season.  It's better here.
I'm rethinking the vegan lifestyle.
But on the other hand, our grass is greener.

What I wouldn't give for a good steak right now.
No man, we agreed - you see it, you swim for it.
Wow, Fred, the icebergs really are melting! That used to be the top of the Big Rock Candy Mountain!
Its actually a sea monster called 'Sweety.'
We sure picked the wrong week go on the Mediterranean diet.
I wonder why the cartoonist didn't put a shark fin in there somewhere.
Don't bother, it's all empty calories.

We'll need to find a separate island that has insulin.
Sure, sure, the other "Island is always sweeter."
They call it Temptation Island

And that’s the difference between deserted island and desserted island
I'm staying put.  That looks like some kind of Trojan Horse thing to me.
Can't. I'm on a diet.
It's amazing what you can do with a whale carcass and enough microplastic.
We picked the wrong time to start the 30-day no sugar challenge.
I don't have a sweet tooth left.
I imagined you. Why can't I imagine Cupcake Island?
Dude, this view is sweet!
It's for the survivors of the first Mediterranean diet.
Aren't we a pair. You with your borderline diabetes and me with high cholesterol.
I think I'll pass.  I'd hate to spoil my appetite.
I KNOW you wanted a burger, but this is the only joint that would deliver!
It’s just a delirious Fig Newton of our imagination!
You really can't swim?
Desserted  Island?
If we look the other way it will be easier...
Yeah, I agree, it looks deserted.
Hey, at least we aren’t on that island. They say too much sugar will kill you.
My next hallucination is going to have less carbs.
We need to re-evaluate our efforts to attract help.
I wish we were stranded on Dessert Island.
According to local legend, that island autocorrected to 'dessert'.
We can't because we don't have any toothbrushes.
I lost my left leg getting a piece of cake
Yeah, but I'd hate if there was any sand on it...
Yeah, well, I think gluten is the least of our problems.
I get it,Phil...a desserted island.
I'm starting to reconsider this whole gluten intolerance thing.
Pick this island, you said. It'll be fun, you said.
It's a mirage.  There's nothing there but kale and tofu.
Do you have to be such a stickler for spelling?
I hope we get marooned on a dessert island next time.
Susie, I don’t think our travel agent can spell.
But if we swam over it would be illegal immigration...
Why bother? The donut probably has coconut on it.
There goes the neighborhood. Next thing we know... TOURISTS!
Guess we started the Keto diet too soon.
It looks like a sweet deal but we might get in over our heads.
It was there when I woke up.  I think the sharks put it there for us.
It's called Dentist island.
I told you there's a second "s" in "dessert"!
well the grass was greener over here, but now I got the munchies.
The board game made it look bigger.
It appears to be a typo...
It appeared right after the sharks ate that Madison Avenue guy.
I know I specified DESSERT island.
Yeah, but the schools here are great.
You know, that mirage is loaded with high-fructose corn syrup.
Don’t even think about it.  Cheat day is not until Sunday.
You can go if you want. But all the studies say they shorten your life expectancy.
I've never been, but it's on my bucket list.
I don't care if it's a trap but I wish I had taken some swimming lessons.
We're on the wrong reality show.
It's a melange.
Somewhere Darwin is laughing at us.
And entirely free of cocoanut....
No thanks. Too much palm oil.
Okay. But after we swim to the  Isle of Toothbrush.
Hansel, we got stranded on the wrong island.
Yeah but there's no chocolate"
If that's heaven, we must be in hell.
As if the confusion of desert island with deserted island was not bad enough already before this whole desserted island thing entered the picture.
I don't think this is what my doctor meant when she told me to stay away from sugar!
It wouldn't be so bad if I liked coconut.
I heard they're building a wall.
Why do you get to be Hansel and I have to be Gretel?
But then again, if they ARE gluten-free, we avoid the whole question of cannibalism.
Talk about your childhood wishes...
Yesterday they were showing gin gimlets.
Look on the bright side. Your BMI and cholesterol are way down.
It's great how much weight we've lost since we swam here.
We were just one spellcheck away...
What we really need is something savory.
I'm never making another New Years resolution
Empty calories. It wouldn't be worth the effort.
Don't fall for it, that is a Portuguese man of candy-land jelly fish.
I thought people only saw mirages in the desert, or should I say dessert?
Did you remember your epipen?
So technically that's still Paleo, right?
I can’t wait to be desserted.
“ It wasn’t there yesterday. It must be an ile flottante."
Let's swim over. We'll burn a few calories...
You think they're thinking the same thing we are?
That's what's left of the Big Rock Candy Mountain. It's just the Little Sweets Iceberg after global warming.
It’s all that’s left of The Good Ship Lollypop.
The thing is we don’t have toothbrushes
Let’s wait—tomorrow’s our cheat day.
I can’t believe you forgot your insulin pen.
I don't know Gretel, but an island made out of candy seems like a fairy tale.
Did you wish to be on a Deserted island or a Dessert-ed island?
I don't give a damn if it's the Good Ship Lollipop, I don't trust it.
The difference between here and there is one letter of the alphabet.
Keep your eyes peeled for the Good Ship Lollipop.
Yeah, but if we were over there would you really want to be rescued?
Behold, the Islet of Langerhans.
One S makes all the difference.
It's not easy being diabetic.
I thought my dream would come true, but I guess I mispelled dessert when I wished for an island getaway.
Well on the bright side, we're both diabetic.
Our island is better.  Do you realize how fat we’d be if we lived on that one.
So that’s where the good ship lollipop ended up
The last time share offered pizza.
Sharks? What about all that high-fructose corn syrup?
My turn. Let’s think about some power tools.
Is it cheat day yet?
The last time you saw pastries and candy canes, we ended up on this side.
And I thought this was a deserted island.
When I played it as a kid, the land just seemed bigger.
We COULD move, but I have dietary restrictions.
That's a lot of carbs, but if we swim and only eat half,  we're good.
I just realized, we're on a desert island, so those must be our just deserts.
Dude, I told you to spell check Dessert Island before you got directions."
Trust me, it's just empty calories.
The dessertification of the south seas!
Yes, but it's all carbs.
It looks friendly.
Oh, it's like a current/currant thing.  That's funny, though not really right now.
Yes, but do they have coconut?
As Wittgenstein said, “The limits of my spelling are the limits of my world.”
DO you think Lent is over by now?
Thanks to global warming, that is all that’s left of Gumdrop Mountain
I can't handle eating another island.
Hey, last week it was a full course meal!
A dessert island? Ironic!
Did you put the wrong address for the delivery?
Well. obviously it's from the good ship Lollipop.
That is all that is left after Hurri-cane Candy
I know it's deserted but that's a pretty sweet view.
Carbs don't count when you're a castaway.
I propose a cost-benefit analysis.
It's too pretty to eat
Palm oil is so much healthier you know.
I would go but it’s not locally sourced.
Mr. Wonka trusted you, Charlie.
For the last time, that isn't Easter Island and this isn't Greenland!
I've never had a sweet tooth.I'm going to wait for the protein mirage before I waste my energy swimming out to it.
I understand that Willy Wonka bought his own island.
Yes, we could, but it would take weeks to work off the calories.
I'm Paleo but you go ahead.
Kinda want to play Candyland now
Shipwrecked AND developing type 2 diabetes; no thanks.
I see danger written all over it.
Don't. It's just empty calories.
It was called Big Rock Candy Mountain till climate change took over.
I told you “dessert island” was spelled with two S’s!
It'll take all of our floss to build a raft.
Well, I'm not sure what it is, but it's definitely not the land of milk and honey"
That second ‘s’ really makes a difference.
I'm more of a pie guy anyway
How did you spell Dessert?
Not to appear delusional, but the pie looks like a boat.
We’ll we’ve got friendship.
I said dessert NOT desert!
No, not interested. I just started working out again.
They say hallucinations are to be expected during week one of the keto diet
Mirages can be so sarcastic.
This would be a no-brainer if it weren't for the sharks.
OK, but you'll have to brush your teeth.
I swear they said covered with cannibals, not candy edibles.
At first it seemed like a dream come true...
That was Dave. Big fan of that British baking show.
Of course it's a trap. If it were a humanitarian gesture, it would be covered in kale. OK, maybe a few rolls of paper towels, but mostly kale.
No way.... sugar kills.
Well there goes our South Beach diet.
Is it ironic our grass is greener.
Talk about gentrification
The Good Ship Lollypop must have gone down last night too.
Ever since I started that keto diet, I see it too.
Oh, come on!  Has mythology taught you nothing?
That giant clam is just mess’n with us.
Forget  it, even if it’s real, it’s not worth the empty calories.
Seriously.  If you repeat that pun one more time, I’ll kill you.
I believe they call it the Great Pacific Junk Food Patch.
This South Beached diet is really working.
Still doubt climate change? That's the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I can't decide, let's split the whole mirage.
Why couldn’t we land on THAT desserted island?
We both know that it’s a mirage,but I’m smelling coffee.
I'd swim it, but I think it's just bad copyediting.
We need to build a wall.
You go. I'll keep an eye peeled for sharks.
Too bad the insulin went down in the crash.
And then what?
I reckon we just missed it by one letter s.
OK, it's bad for our teeth and there are sharks in the water, but I say we go for it.
Before climate change, we called it 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain'.
I gave up that island for Lent.
It’s not my fault. I told the travel agent ‘Dessert Island’.
I mean, it's tempting, but all those empty calories!
Do you suppose the Good Ship Lollipop finally capsized?
What are the chances?
I'll bet you that my mirage is better than your's
Well Rob, this is as close to a desserted island as we're going to get.
I blame Jeff Bezos.  I wrote Amazon Prime asking them to deliver me from a desert island.  Instead, they delivered a dessert island.
I think we picked the wrong excursion.
I'm thinking of getting off the South Beach diet.
Man... I wish I had saved space for dessert...
I'm pretty sure I saw an ICE agent hiding behind the donut.
Worst part is we're not even lost. This is what Trump's global warming did to Cleveland. That's a Dairy Queen.
It may only be a mirage but it makes me happy
The good ship Lollipop ran aground there and Miss Temple was eventually rescued.
You know I wish we went to swim lessons
Candyland ? Or funny looking sub?
What bothers me is that it’s slowly moving.
I don't care...it's full of high fructose corn syrup and I'm not eating it!
Yes, but you can swim off all of those extra calories.
Do you think it’s worth the calories?
I would not bother. It is all high glycemic.
Yes, you are better at spelling than I am, but here we both are.
It's not that I don't feel lucky, I just wish we were stranded on a dessert island.
If you say, "The Big Rock Candy Island," I will throw you in the water.
So far it's better than the Fyre Festival
Interesting, since I've stopped drinking, my fantasies have changed!
It’s just as well, I’m diabetic
Look on the bright side: our island is gluten free.
Empty calories.
Why do I have to wait for your cheat day?
Is that with one "s" or two?
I guess we should have sprung for the all-inclusive resort.
If that was six women, I'd risk it.
I wonder where the kids went?
One wish, and you leave out a lousy 's' ?
Who eats cupcakes anymore?
God wasn’t sure how to spell it either.”
So candy land does exist.
Actually, I prefer our more traditional look.
Looks like Someone misspelled desert island.
Not that’s a real dessert island
If you were stuck on a dessert island...
Uber Eats?
You go ahead, I swore off refined sugars.
I'm expecting the Good Ship Lollipop any day now.
I was hoping for a grown up fantasy.
When I close my eyes, I can see Doris and the kids and our dogs. It's like they're right here with me. I guess it makes sense...they say you imagine those who have been there for you the most. Anyway, what about you - Who do you see, Jack?
Candyland was just a game. This is reality.
Let’s go there on Cheat Day.
I’ll be Hansel and you’ll be Gretel.
I hate coconut.
Don't you think this should be a riddle?
I'm waiting for the healthy choice option.
If one of us was a dentist, then I definitely would.
You invest in coconuts and sugar cane and now look --gentrification.
Enticing, but we have no dental plan.
You have my insulin, right?
Empty calories, man... empty calories.
No way,dude. Those carbs will kill you.
...and I was just getting down to my target weight.
I suppose we could splurge just this once.
It would just go straight to my thighs.
No man is a coconut.
That's where the Good Ship Lollipop sank.
What did you expect to see on the Lollypop cruise, kale?
Are we having a desert island mirage or a dessert island mirage?
My dentist was the developer.
The Island of Misfit Foods.
That's my dream, this is our reality.
I was sure I had included the second "s" in the travel booking.
We have to wait 30 minutes before we can swim to the next island.
The water's always bluer...
You had to spell it correctly, didn't you.
We shouldn't of eaten the candy boat first.
Would you believe I just spent 6 months losing 30 pounds?
Look, the candy’s always sweeter on the other Island.
If we don't get rescued, no one would ever believe us.
If only we had been stranded on dessert island.
Guess it's not always grass.
Probably the result of the Candy Caine Mutany
Yes, they look good, but not to die for...
I told you not to trust auto-correct.
I still don't think anyone will come.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to start the South Beach Diet.
I'm beginning think that Charlie is not coming back.
I wish we had more options
Do you still want to give up sugar?
Better to be stranded on a dessert island.
Salty air always makes me crave sweets.
Hansel, that witch just won't stop following us
In Homer's time, sailors succumb to a siren, not to a sugar-high.
The next time you meet a genie, focus on annunciating the S.
Think about it Larry, if we make it, we'd be Dessert Island castaways.  Don't you agree that's more palatable?
You may see a savior from starvation, but I see a disguised alien spaceship waiting for two more victims.
Sharks have become much more inventive. That's what they call "man lure."
Sure, being stranded sucks. But the view is pretty sweet.
Sure,it's all fun and games but then comes the anal probe.
Nah! You go. I'm diabetic.
No, I don't think that's Sweden
Well at least I can stick to my diet this vacation
We must have collided with the Good Ship Lollipop.
Wonka's tour was more fun before climate change.
Looks like the folks on the Good Ship Lollipop have colonized.
Your no sugar diet is killing me.
Nows the time I wish I had taken swimming lessons.
I say let's go treat ourselves today for once.
So that’s where all the bees went.
It's the island of earthly desserts
On the bright side, ours is gluten free!
Yeah, but ours has more personality.
You go ahead.  I'm on a keto diet.
No no no, I ordered a sub!
I've said it once,and I'll say it again. I wish I could swim.
It looks desserted but maybe someone is over there.
I think we got desserted on the wrong island
I could kill for some milk right now.
Hallucination or not, it’s a damn side better sight than an island made of broccoli...
So you're starving; I still prefer the mirage with the satyrs and nude dancing girls.
Even my mirages get confused between desert and dessert.
Don’t try to sweet talk me into swimming across
No, you moron, “enjoy a dessert island escape” is not spelled with one s!
The brochure said it was only a short walk away.'
Moment on the lips, forever on the hips.
Can I try your glasses for a sec ?
I don't care if it's not your 'cheat day', I'm swimming over.
They think we're suckers
It's no cakewalk...
Just tell me. How does a desert island become a dessert island?
I prefer the all organic, non-GMO, gluten free mirage.
Good” ship lollipop my ass
Pretty sweet.
Look! It's the good sub, Lollipop
I for one am glad it's shark infested water. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
The thing is I've cut sugar.
It really bugs me how they've commercialized Christmas Island."
Now I understand how mexicans see the US.
Could be worse.
Ya know, I'm tired of coconuts.
The sharks are very creative with their bait.
I guess I booked desert island instead of dessert island
When they told me swimming lessons could save my life, this was NOT what I had in mind.
Next time, I'll roll the dice.
Clearly a deserted island.
They misspelled 'desert.
New Year's resolution be damned ... I'm goin' for it.
"I don't know, I'm more of a pickles and chips person."
Too bad I lost my sweet tooth.
So much for being rescued by the Good Ship Lollypop
Actually, I could go for something savory.
People will come, Ray. People will most definitely come.
the girl scouts are going all out!!
Maybe it's just the dehydration, but I feel like this mirage is quizzing me on my grammar.
That island is sweet.
Too bad we're gluten free.
Cheat day?
Chutes and Ladders might have been more helpful.
Well, at least we're healthy...
I think I'm having a dessert mirage.
I’d hate to ruin my diner.
What do you think, real news or fake news?"
I'd like to see a mirage that is more vegan
I’m holding out for maple-glazed bacon.
We clearly haven't been marooned long enough.
When you're really a stickler for grammar.
I never have liked puns.
Let's send the person who invented auto-correct to dessert island, and when he gets here ask him how HE likes it.
Don't spoil your appetite now. Just wait for low tide when you can see the whole pyramid.
See, that Keto diet is working already! I see that island, and I feel healtheir, happier, and I don't even want that cupcake.
From now on I Make the on-line reservations How could you Not know DeSSert Island has two S's
See what happens when you let Amazon come in and build a new headquarters?
Ohhhhh wait. So what you actually said was, ‘life would be sweet on a DESSERTED island?’
I don’t care how hungry you get, Kevin, we’re sticking to the diet
The sweetest part is the anticipation.
At last... the dessert cart!
I know, but I'm much happier gluten-free."
...and we got stranded on Vegan Island!!
We may be the only castaways who gained weight during their ordeal.
I'll bet that donut floats as well.
Welcome to Atkins Island.
I knew that shark’s camouflage 
abilities had evolved, but this
is a little scary
So... What are you giving up for Lent this year?
Doesn't bother me. I'm a diabetic who can't swim.
Or maybe we're pastries dreaming we're humans!
Let’s face it, you can’t have your cookies, candy and cake and the shade of the palm tree too.
You go ahead. I'm diabetic.
It's the good ship Lollipop. Goes by every Saturday.
But honey, what about your New Year's resolution?
Unless there’s an insulin island close by, I’ll pass.
It's February, all that stuff is stale.
This is what we get for buying cheap airfare tickets.They sent us to the wrong desserted island.
I'm kind of holding out for the Cheesecake Factory.
I always knew that spelling bee in 4th grade would come back to haunt me.
That was the one thing you’d bring?
You go ahead. I'm still on the Atkins Diet.
Don’t you know the difference between dessert and desert?
I'm thinking of giving up on the New Yorker Caption Contest
Well I guess I can check type 2 diabetes off my bucket list.
Are you a dentist?
Who knew the Good Ship Lollipop was not seaworthy?
That genie really was a stickler for inflection.
I thought Christmas Island was further north.
It’s also spelled differently.
Don't worry.  A Disney cruise is bound to come by soon.
I'm just telling you, last time I went there I really regretted it.
It's a new Amazon location, and it's not an isolated incident
'Desert', with one S
One of us is having the mother of all hallucinations...
Thank god we found the Islets of Insulin.
So this is what it felt like to be at the Fyre festival.
If it were a real mirage it would have meat and potatoes.
All that's left of the Good Ship Lollypop.
You go. I prefer savory.
Wait, so then what's a homonym?
This is the human condition: we always want what we can’t have.
Is that the winter White House?
It could be worse, we could be stranded on a dessert island.
It's all empty calories anyway.
It all looks good except for the coconut creme pie.
Go for it. I'm more of a red meat guy.
Did you use one "s" or two when you put the note in the bottle?
Last year it was a miniature golf course. Some locations just don’t do well no matter what you put on them.
Too bad the cartoonist didn’t know the difference between “desert” and “dessert”!
Darn! I was hoping we'd catch the main course . . .
It seems your pie in the sky ideas have come down to earth.
The question remains: are they candy canes or antennae?
For sure it's not the Atkins Island!
Make one typo on one restaurant menu...
Nothing's hopeless. Think Tom Hanks.
My fantasy island would have booze and babes.
Seems our neighbor has a sweet tooth.
I hear it's members only...
All I can see is heartburn
If stranded on a dessert island, what's the one thing you'd most like to have?"
It's not the carbs that are bothering me.
I thought you said dessert island not deserted island.
You should swing by my place. It's pretty sweet.
Everything's sweeter on the other side.
I wish it was a meringue instead of a mirage.
Well, I did pay extra for a sweet view.
I told you Candyland was real.
I wonder if they have NY style pizza
Was that there yesterday?
No, actually...I think it’s, “desserted isle.”
When the Good Ship Lollipop swings by, we make our move.
On the bright side, we won't have to worry about gaining weight
I heard it’s pretty sweet on that island.
We called it Big Rock Candy Mountain until global warming.
Isn't the final stage of dehydration seeing candy?
I always forget which one has two s’s.
This game is way more fun then saying what shapes you see in the clouds
Turns out my travel agent is a real stickler about spelling.
Did you pack my insulin?
Those carbs will kill you.
at least we have better shade.
Good thing it's a mirage.  I'm diabetic.
I could have sworn the tickets said Dessert Island.
Looks like they've evolved to lure land-based prey.
I guess the women want us to come back??
No, dessert has 2 “s’s.”
After all this time, I still can’t remember which one is spelled with two S’s.
I wish our island was desserted.....
Yes, but the view is better from over here.
At least we are not stranded on a dessert.
It's true, the grass is sweeter on the other side!
Looks good, Gretel .
Do you think it's a mirage, Wilson?
I don't care what you're giving up for Lent.
I don't know whether to be flattered or not when you say you prefer cannibalism."
That’s how I remember there’s one S in deserted.
I don't know about you but I just don't think I've earned it.
I’ll go first to make sure it’s safe.
For how long has The Great British Baking Show had a mirage challenge?
No, no – go on without me. I'm trying to stick to my resolutions this year.
Beware of turtles bearing gifts.
Yes, Frank, her divorce attorney WAS pretty good.
We'll be saved. The Good Ship Lollipop docks here once a week.
At least we can catch the Swedish Fish.
Yeah, and all because of a typo.
My disdain for corn syrup suddenly seems misplaced.
Think positive!  We don't eat carbs anyways!
Just give it a month and your body will naturally stop craving that stuff.
Are we still doing Atkins?
I can''t help wondering what's below the surface.
It was nice of your ex to remember your birthday but you should have called someone else before your phone died.
So he eats desserts,shoots,AND leaves?
I told you it was all inclusive
Too bad we gave up sugar.
Don't bother swimming over.  These things always turn out to be mirages.
When my doctor told me to start watching carbs...
I’ve been there.  It’s not so great.
You’re really a dentist?
All I want for Christmas is an isthmus.
I kinda wish it was "Beer Land"..
Just our luck. If we had another "s" we'd be on the dessert island.
It's obviously a dessert-ed island
I still stand behind my vote for the Brexit.
This is exactly what I was telling my therapist, I'm always unsatisfied with what I got.
Some day all that could be ours.
You know the angler fish that tease you with a worm-like tentacle? I don't think it's an island. Just sayin'.
I find that people often underestimate the difficulty of living with diabetes.
And just this morning I went on a diet.
Whatever happened to cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels?
Maybe so, but this one is gluten-free.
Okay but this time, get the donut.
Before Global Warming, we called that Big Rock Candy Mountain
Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
No, ours only has one 's'.
Added sugars really can hide in some surprising places.
Yes, I see it. But do you see the Minotaur?
Think we picked the wrong week to go carb free!
Let's wait for The Good Ship Lollipop.
Castaway 2: the cake-walk
You mean I could have brought three things to a desserted island?
Screw the carbs.  I say we go for it.
Pay no attention; it's just another dessert mirage!
So the good news is it’s gluten free. The bad news is they don’t take Apple Pay...
The extra 's' makes all the difference.
Of all the months to start this detox diet.
Unfortunately, no dessert until we clean our plates. Unfortunately, no plates.
I don’t care that Fred was eaten by a giant squid – I’m feeling lucky.
Damn, I'm diabetic.
Look! It’s Candyland! But 
Where’s the Good Ship Lollipop!?
It’s not just the grass that’s greener on the other island
Hey, I like puns as much as the next man, but I refuse to say it.
No dessert until you eat some dinner.
Too bad there's no ice cream.
Hansel, what couid possibly go wrong if we were to swim over and take a nibble or two?
One more S and we could've been on a dessert island.
Just think  —  If we’d washed up over there, we’d be diabetic by now.
First, it's a Caribbean island, not a Carb island and it wasn't funny the first hundred times you said it.
Dude,it's an illusion. It's just a million pounds of garbage.
The doughnut is a tire,the frosting is grocery bags,the candy canes are broken arches from the burger place...
God’s idea of a micro-aggression.
Before we start swimming, did you bring your insulin?
So, maybe next time I will take the free swim lessons at the "Y".
Great, another Fyre festival.
Darn autocorrect! I'm sure the artist meant to put us on a dessert island.
I wonder what THEIR ship was like?
So real I can almost taste it
I could have sworn it was a typo.
Have you given any thought to the North Beach Diet instead?
I prefer desert to dessert, don't you?
Big rock candy mountain  isnt the same with global  warming.
Looks like there's one  good thing about surviving the sinking of the Good Ship Lollipop.
I told you we should’ve paid for the extra S.
I mean, I would, but think of the calories!
Or...We can sit here until we starve to death, 
debating whether too much sugar is bad for your diet!
Maybe we should have opted for all inclusive.
I wished to be off the desserted island...
No, there’s no ‘dessert island’; it’s a mirage.  Look, all the calories are empty!
No Carl! You haven't had sugar in 2 months, don't cave now.
Don't worry. I'm pretty sure they can't swim.
I don't care if it's just a typo, let's go after dinner!
Has that always been there?
That was my favorite campaign promise.
And that’s Neil Young’s place over there.
My bad, dude. Like, I totally swear I clicked on "dessert" island for one week, two guests.
Remember, we pledged solidarity on this keto diet no matter what.
Go for it. I'm off sugar.
It's at moments like this that my commitment to a calorie free diet begins to waver.
I was wrong. Keto island is not fun at all.
Must have been shipwrecked ssometime in the 1950's
We can either die of sun or sugar exposure
But do they have coconut milk?
There's a blonde curly headed kid over there that keeps singing "On the Good Ship Lollypop" and I couldn't take it anymore.
'"Damn the sharks!"
Now might be a good time to give up my "no sugar" diet.
If I swim back and forth between each bite, I can burn off the carbs and still look great in my bathing suit!
You've gotta have a dream.
It's the Russians trying to tempt us to come over to their side.
Carmen Miranda goes snorkeling every day about this time.
But what if there's a witch with a snorkel?
Can't swim, can you?
I prefer my girls in grass skirts mirage...
I don't care if you are a dentist, I'm going over.
It's only a mirage; we still have 29 more days of this diet
It's the worst when the wind is out of the East!
No Sh*t, that's Candyland?
Don’t do it. We’ve got all the food I need right here.
Sorry about that I really thought it was a muffin top
Any plans for tonight?
Well, you should've gone over on cheat day
What a difference an 's' makes, huh?
I wonder if they're wondering about us
I imagined a different kind of treasure.
I guess there are two S's in dessert island...
All that talk about how smart dolphins are.  You can't help but admire these local sharks!
And of course, my cheat day isn't until tomorrow.
No, I’m staying here. I gave up sweets for Lent.
That's the iceberg that sank the 'Good Ship Lollipop.'
We should have upgraded to premium!
I realize we are dreaming, but still the sharks in that water
don't know that.
It’s the Island of Empty Calories.
they'll just make you thirsty
That's my fantasy.  What's yours?
All desert islands are the same he said, we’ll save 50 bucks he said...
Don’t give up. Looks like the Good Ship Lollipop made a stop recently.
I sure picked the wrong day to start my diet
Without floss and a toothbrush it is sheer madness, I tell you.
I'd swim for it, but there's a bunch of lemon sharks around there.
I guess that's a dessert island.
I forgot my insulin.
The difference one tiny 's' makes!
Look, it's typo island.  Yum!
They’re not spelled the same, either—it’s a "dessert" island.
And an extra "s" has made all the difference.
See, I TOLD you spelling matters!
Sorry Bob, I can't. I'm doing keto right now.
Its called Mar a Lago.
I wished for a desserted island!
It’s best to save your extra points for the weekends.
It’s strictly for twelve and under - Michael Jackson built it
No, you go ahead. I'm cutting down on sugar.
Plastic.
It'll be fine, you said. Good Ship Lollipop is just a name, you said.
You really outta proofread when you write your wishes.
Haven't you ever seen a dessert island?
Sure, I've heard of an anglerfish.  Why?
Look at the good part—at least we eat healthier on this side!
I wonder if that dessert desert island is deserted?
They had a war, and the paleo tribe lost.
I’m fine. I ate before we left.”
We thought we were on a deserted island
And I bet they have free WiFi as well !
You really think it's Mar-a-lago?
You have to remember the Castaway Mirage only lasts for 15 minutes; then you crash.
Well, there goes the neighborhood. Is that my tacky mirage or yours?
I could have sworn it was two "s"s.
I think I'm mirage intolerant
Dude...Sweet
I’m going to try this one more time. It’s not a deserted island, it’s a DESSERTED island. Nobody gets me!
Sure I am starving but I am not a big dessert fan.
Meanwhile, in hell for people who can't swim
Too bad it's not chicken wings and beer.
All I see is a food desert
If it's big enough to eat them, it's big enough to eat us.
No, it' not a mirage.  It's actually part of the great gyre of discarded candies and sweets that ceaselessly rotate about the ocean.
I ‘m afraid our dessert island was misspelled.
It’ll still be there later, when I really need it. I mean when WE need it.
It seems to be a "Dessert-ed" Island.
But we would lose the benefit of all the weight we have lost while here
I can’t believe we finished dinnered island. Do you have any room left for desserted island?
I'll pass. I don't see any carrot cake.
That stuff will kill you.
Unfortunately I didn't leave room for dessert.
It’s a mirage but it cheers me up.
Aren't you glad we left? There's no dentist for miles.
I prefer chutes and ladders
Actually, I'm more of a salty person.
It's up to you but remember: a moment of pleasure, a lifetime of regret.
You're never gonna believe this, but when my sister Gretel and I were kids...
That's what happens in a world without literacy.
Five bucks says it's the Good Ship Lollipop.
Once again I find myself in the nightmare I've been having ever since I started the South Beach Diet.
Want another hit of LSD?
Yes Lonnie, mirages can happen on water . .
I'm betting the Good Ship Lollipop is just over the horizon.
I don't care if it's a trap, I want that big cupcake.
Where's the 'Good Ship Lollipop' when you need it?
We don’t have a dental plan, either.
I've been there. It's just a mirage.
When they said Food Network was going under, I wasn't exactly expecting THIS.
I know the grass always looks greener, but that Island looks really sweet.
OK. I give up. Where's the rest of the donut?
Actually, this is South Beach.
Looks sweet!
Think what it would do to your blood sugar.
You did say you wanted to go on a sweet island vacation
..yeah, I hear you man...but what about the witch?
How much do you want to bet that it's just a mirage?
All we need is the good ship Lollipop.
It's better than a cleanse.
The treats are organic but the water is contaminated. I'd say it's a wash.
Forget it. It's probably a Venus fly island.
Kind of a bad month to go Paleo.
‘’Can’t we jus skip the fish, just for one night?”
Helluva mirage, eh?
Let’s try Coconut Island you said. Candy Island is too crowded you said.
Even worse luck. You don't do gluten and  I have diabetes.
I'm pretty sure it's real, because I hate candy canes.
Sweet island dude!
It wouldn't be so bad if the sea wasn't made of chocolate syrup.
All sugar and carbs? And your point is ...?
At least we're not stuck on that dessert island.
I gave up sweets for Lent.
It may look inviting but my mother said I should never swim after eating.
Gretel, do you think that kindly old woman on that other island is willing to share?
Legend has it that's about where the good ship Lollipop went down.
Do you really think those sharks put that much time and effort into such an elaborate decoy?
I picked a bad time to give up sugar.
We could float on the pastries and row with the candy canes
I’ve stopped going there ever since I heard they substituted sugar for high fructose corn syrup”
I expect a massive sugar high at low tide.
But what if it's NOT heatstroke?
And YOU said not to bring my swim trunks.
Moby had one last trick up his sleeve.
I'm not saying it was a bad pun, just easy.
For the hundredth time, we are NOT swimming over there, Hansel
Guess who gets rescued first.
You just had to fire our only flare at the Good Ship "Lollipop"...
You shouldn’t have thrown the lamp after your first wish didn’t appear quick enough.
Do you think we could learn to swim?
Is it a figment of your imagination if we both see the same thing?
If the sharks don't kill you the sugar will.
That has to be a “dessert-ed” island
I’m stuffed unless you want to split the cheesecake.
It may look enticing now but it's just not sustainable in the long run.
That sure is a deserted island.
Yeah, but then what are our chances of ever getting a dental appointment?
If  it’s real, my low carb diet is over.
You gotta admit, that whale carcass is looking *pretty* good right now...
I don’t know, Rob, it just looks too sweet.
It's just a troptical illusion.
Sharks or gluten, tough call.
Like...hey, man....imagine 'Gilligan's Island' meets the 'Food Network,' you know what I mean?
Yeah, I know. Desserted Island. Hilarious.
The thing is if we ate that, we'd die anyway!
Do you think they have ICEs at the border?
Call me paranoid, but that seems a little too attractive.
I'd rather be on a desserted island.
It received 5 stars in Fodor's Stranded Island Ports of Call.
I picked the wrong week to start my diet.
It's a trap.  The last guy sank trying to swim back.
Forget the currents and the  sharks, that much sugar will  kill ya!
If one of us swims over, it will no longer be desserted
As a dentist, I consider ourselves the lucky ones.
I told you to book the dessert island!
Are you saying I picked the wrong island?
Looks like Christmas on Easter Island.
You choose. Die of hunger or die of diabetes?
Wouldn't it be sweet...
There’s no way to get rescued on a desserted island.
I wish we had a board game.
I wonder why the sharks put all their goodies on that island?
This is worse than the Fyre Festival.
You go. I am in the middle of  a colon cleanse.
I've always hated Candyland.
And all we have are mushrooms...
Without my glasses that hallucination looks like a big bunny.
But it will spoil your appetite.
It makes me wish that I had learned to swim. And that  I  didn't have diabetes.
Darn. Looks like we should have spell checked our Airbnb search.
That you think 'Airbnb should have spellcheck' is precisely how we got here.
It boils down to shade vs calories
Coconuts are high in saturated fats too, you know.
Considering what I've been reading about coconut oil, I'd say that IS the healthier choice.
Time for dessert island!
Trust me, the grass will be no greener there
It was put there by the sharks.
Mark, I think it’s fair to admit we should have splurged for the “All-Inclusive.”
I know we're starving, but I really prefer salty to sweet.
I'm telling you, I've been over there. It's all gluten-free.
I don't know how to explain it, my body just feels better when I cut out sugar.
Boy, I know an illusion when I see one!
The sharks are nothing compared to the toothache.
We'll only go on cheat day.
Whaddaya wanna bet they're not gluten-free?
No way!  I'd have to be on the treadmill for a week!
Wait,you gave the genie your wish in writing? You must have forgotten the second "s."
Just write the Genie back and ask for world piece.
Burl, could this be the "Big Rock Candy Mountain ? " " Go back to sleep ,Woody.
This South Beach Diet isn't getting any easier.
Empty calories, eh?
Ours is more of a paleo island, though
The strawberry was a mistake - it was too much.
You go ahead...I'm vegan.
Yes,that used to be Big Rock Candy Mountain,but now it's just Pleasure Island due to global warming!
Are we out of floss?
Sure makes your eyes glaze over, doesn't it?
I think we should complain to the zoning commission
I think psychologists have gone too far with the marshmallow test replications.
That reminds me; I'm going to miss my dentist appointment.
To think, we could have been on a deserted"island.
I can’t - I’m training for a marathon.
I decided to throw it out because it didn't spark joy.
I can't remember if it's two "S"s or one.
Good thing I'm on the small beach diet.
I am NOT giving up my summer body.
Next time we use the teleportation device, let's check our spelling.
That's just a dessert ile.
The addition of the sharks has meant that this is the best diet I’ve ever been on.
Ted... I think you’re losing it, man.
I don’t know, I heard moving is one of the more stressful life events.
That won't work, I'm doing paleo.
All for the best. My dentist said to stay away from sweets.
Yeah, the mescalin often has that effect on you.
You never heard of Shark Bait Island?
I dare you to eat that entire island.
I swear the message in my bottle said, "A raft would come in HANDY."
My Doctor said I should watch my sugar
But you've gotta admit, we look great.
This is very thoughtful but I was hoping for some protein.
I really, really hate sharks.
Sure, you had to sail on 'The Good Ship Lollipop!'
Nah, not worth it. A palm tree in hand is worth two donuts in the sand and I only see one donut over there.
I had to move from there.  Dentist bills were killing me.
You go ahead, I'm cutting back on sweets.
It’s our just deserts that this one’s just desert and that one’s just desserts.
Well if God’s so perfect, why aren’t all islands dessert-ed?
I hear its all saccharine.
Well, you say mirage, I say meringue”.
I'm staying away from carbs.
I'm starving, but I'd rather not risk a cavity.
Wait till she gets out of the pool then we can just walk there.
This was the worst time to go Paleo.
Yes, most of the inhabitants arrived there on the Good Ship Lollipop.
Tom, you have made your point. Spelling is a cornerstone of civilisation...
Someday we’ll laugh about this.
I have to admit the sharks are getting more and more clever at disguising themselves.
Some retirement planner you are!
Well, it's down to you and me on, "Survivor: Paleo".
Remind me why we came over here.
Ignore it, it's just a cartoonist's meme.
Don't go.  Too many ants!
This year's Fyre Festival looks a lot more interesting
They call it “Candy Land.”
Tough break, with the gluten sensitivity and all.
Is ours spelled with one 's', or two?"
Seriously?
See? Once you stop eating sugar, you no longer care.
No, unfortunately, that's just where Route 66 attractions go to die.
You have to jump the shark to get there
The sand is always sweeter on the other isle.
It must be a mirage. There's no way that pie is only 90 calories.
I know it's tempting, but I've already lost five pounds on the keto diet.
Bet you wish we hadn't eaten the good ship Lollipop now.
Our island looked so much better in the brochure
Now you know why I told you to spell “desert” with two esses!
I heard cavity searches are mandatory for visitors
Well, they just didn't spark joy.
If only we were stranded on the dessert island.
I mean, I have high blood sugar anyway.
They have a serious ant situation over there.
Do you hear the music too?
I've heard the sharks in these waters are very clever at disguise.
What I wouldn’t give for a chute or ladder!
Yes, those are the remains of the Good Ship Lollipop.
I think the Good Ship Lollipop got stranded too.
The grass is greener here.
Why yes, I did play Candyland when I was a child. Why do you ask?
good call on writing candyland in the bottle message
Lucky for us. Refined sugar is a killer.
I’m rethinking my low carb diet.
Survivor Candyland...piece of cake!
Spelling was never my strong suit.
No, really, treats in the ocean will serve us far better than pie in the sky.
No way, Bob, its definitely hamburgers, biscuits, and two large antennas”
Dang, now I wish I'd taken swim lessons.
Care to join me? I've always wanted to visit a desserted island.
The "Desert Island Diet" is harder than I thought it would be.
A spoonful of sugar helps the loneliness go down.
Man, that place looks sweet!
Go ahead. But don’t say I didn’t warn you about empty calories
Let's not get too friendly with the new neighbors. First of all, their landscaping is atrocious and if we invite them over for coffee, the next thing you know they' ll be borrowing tools and just dropping in without calling first.
interesting,a deserted dessert island
If only we had the good ship lollipop to get there.
It's bait. Sharks are casting for us.
Nah, it's not worth it. If the sharks don't get you, the diabetes will.
Don't be fooled; it's the Trojan submarine wanting to invade our island.
What are you talking about sweetie? All I see are palm trees.
Sure, but then you'll want to brush your teeth.
I still prefer it here on the Island of Vegan Treats.
You go on ahead, I'm gonna wait for the one with health insurance.
I may be sunburned, but those guys are really baked.
Remember… a lifetime on the hips.
I'm not sure how they do it- the icing never melts!!
I'd join you, but I want to look thin for my rescuer.
That's what's left of the Good Ship Lollipop
Now that's my idea of a deserted island!
That used to be the summit of the big rock candy mountain.
Next time first we play CandyLand, then Battleship
This is what a low carb diet does to mirages.
I’m watching my carbs, but you go ahead.
This sugar-free diet is really killing me.
Three years and we haven't even caught, much less eaten, a single kid. I'm beginning to think that witch didn't know what she was talking about
I’m watching my weight but you go ahead.
Guess it wasn't such a great idea making the hull out of sugar too
Ted, there could be a jelly doughnut on the other side
I heard the sharks are looking for a younger diet.
We need Chutes and Ladders to get there.
Looks like we are getting rescued by the good ship lollipop
I could sure use a quick burst of energy.
It was the “Jaws Breakers” sign that stopped me from swimming over.
Meh. I prefer savory.
Yes, I get it; two esses. Very funny.
You say deserted, I say desserted. What’s the dif?
If we swim over there, we’ll have to wait half an hour before eating anything.
Remember, carbs are your worst enemy.
I finally understand what it is to be desserted.
I swear it's closer!
Maybe I should have voted 'remain'
Has anyone escaped this godforsaken island?" "Yeah it was a piece of cake!
That witch from Hansel and Gretel...she’s offering “thrilling” getaways on her private island.
Maybe we should rethink that paleo diet?
Just my luck, a dentist had to row me to shore.
Ever tried swimming in chocolate?
Ignore it... it's just Fantasy Island
Take your pick. Starvation or going off your Keto diet.
So do you think minimalism was a good choice
Why do you keep calling me Hansel?
No, that's not Tahiti its the lost island of Diabetes."
It looks appealing, but the parking is terrible.
Ever been to a desserted island before?
Shall we go for it, even though it is a mirage?
It's OK for a day or two, but I'm more of a Chutes and Ladders guy.
I'm on a diet anyway.
If I was stuck on a dessert island, I would bring...
Looks like I picked  the wrong week to give up sweets.
I'd prefer a yellow submarine.
Don't believe it.  The grass always looks greener on another island!
Those little round things are skulls.
I'm more a savory kind of guy.
I still say, they should have invited us..
Just our luck, you can’t swim and I’m on Atkins.
I’m not going to undo months of Soulcycle in a moment of weakness Gary!
It used to be part of a golf course but then the president was impeached and now they'll do anything to draw customers
You want ants! That's how get ants.
You’re the one that wanted to play “Chutes and Ladders,” and not “Candyland.”
It would have gone straight to my hips anyway.
Let's save it for dessert.
But ours is all inclusive.
The wreck of the good ship Lollipop still haunts my dreams.
Stay strong, man, just two more weeks till swimsuit season.
Who cares if it’s one “s” or two, you said
At last we know what happened to Amelia Earhart!
Say it with me: 'Empty calories; nothing to see here."
Damn autocorrect! I typed "dessert island."
If only one of us could swim!
Yes, it's tempting, but the sugar and cholesterol could kill you.
I told you Bill, that island isn't Paleo
I’m gluten sensitive, lactose intolerant, and I can’t swim. Is that reason enough?
I told you it wasn't a typo.
How come we didn’t get marooned on a dessert island?
Oh.  You wanted the desserted island!
A dessert Island or a big rock candy mountain, I’d guess.
Quit humming Big Rock Candy Mountain
I don’t think the Oompa-Loompas can help us, Mr. Wonka....
I 'd trade empty calories for shade any day.
Twist of fate I  guess.  All that, but we have the coconut.
Imagine being stranded on a dessert island instead.
I used to live there before I went vegan.
And if it turns out to be a mirage?
It looks closer than it is.
As hallucinations go, that’s a cruel one.
I wouldn’t trust it- I don’t see any tiramisu.
Yes, but think of the carbs...
Wednesday is my mirage cheat day.
It may be hard to reach, but I bet it tastes as good as it looks.
First the Titanic, then the Good Ship Lollipop.
Next time wish for a dessert island.
Go ahead.  I’m the one with diabetes.
Boy, if only we weren't vegan.
I told you to get a travel agent that could spell
I guess global warming does have a sweet side to it.
Well, somebody got to pick more than 3 things to have on their desert island.
Should we be worried about what happens to sea level when the Sno Caps melt?
I wish we could have a vegan mirage.
I'm holding out for more chocolate.
I know you're no-sugar-no-flour, but you know how to swim.
You go, I've never had much of a sweet tooth.
Nah. I'm more of a savory kinda guy.
It might be the Big Rock Candy Mountain. After all, we got here by climbing a mountain to escape the rising oceans.
What do you think of the latest mirage?
Why couldn’t we be stranded on a dessert island?
The second 's' is silent
No thanks.  I’m watching my carbs.
You said you wanted me alone on a "desert" island - genie's got a twisted sense of humor.
Good thing it's my cheat day."
Are we, as an island, truly past autocorrect jokes?
Don't do it man... You're in Ketosis.
It’s tempting, but we’ll spoil our appetites.
That's nothing--wait 'til you see the mirage with the babes in it!
Too bad we weren’t desserted on that island.
I think you’re sugarcoating the merits of swimming to another island.
That coconut we shared  was laced with LSD
Don't be fooled.  That is the infamous and lethal confectionfish.
Looks like another Trump campaign trick.
Oh, man!  We must’ve been asleep when the Good Ship Lollipop sailed past!
It's obviously a complex mirage.
Forget it, Bob -- it's all empty calories.
After all we have been through, we deserve to have our cake and eat it too.
Well... I'm glad we managed to escape that
No one is looking.
If you gain the weight back, I am moving to the other side of this Island
It's probably just a 'Hansel and Gretel' ploy from the local cannibals!
It could be where The Good Ship Lollipop was shipwrecked.
For the last time, Mark, eating the candy cane first would be a stupid choice.
It all looks better everywhere else
Yesterday, I imagined sushi. Oh, wait ...
And you're a dentist, you say?
I'd swim over in a minute if there were mixed nuts.
I never quite got the hang of where and wear either.
It looks okay but I’m really craving coconut.
All those Hollywood types said the Sno-Caps would have melted by now.
Bali Pie awaits us.
Maybe Candy Island is real, and the sharks are a mirage?
They say the sand is always sweeter on the other island.
If we had only done some advance planning like our neighbors, The Wonkas.
I'm really missing that extra 's'.
Maybe we could spend the winter there.
It figures - we’re stuck here when we could have been stranded on a desserted island instead.
Well it’s a shorter swim than the buffet was.
Yeah, right. A desserted isle!"
Don't believe it. Our palm tree's a mirage too, y'know.
Aw..why couldn't we have been marooned on that desserted island?
Did your wife sign you up for the Weight Watchers' retreat too?
Because dessert islands are bad for your teeth.
Marie Antoinette comes to mind...
You know, sometimes I think you need glasses.  That's a humpback whale, my friend.
No, you go ahead...I'm trying to watch my weight.
Just my luck, nothing vegan.
Enough,already! You were right. We shouldn't have booked passage  on the Good Ship Lollipop!
Remember how bored you got playing that game with your kid?
How was I supposed to know the difference?
Wish we had forks.
Too bad we picked "desert island" instead of "dessert island"
I heard Sammy Davis Jr. liked to stay there
Well...our strict coconut diet is actually much more healthy.
I told you we should have taken “The Good Ship Lollipop”
The nightmares began on day 17 of Whole30 . . .
Being surrounded by a sea of caramel lessens the attraction.
Didn't know there was such a thing as a dessert island"

Vince Creo, Madison, N
Sweet place but the taxes will kill you.
A good ship ran aground on that island.
Good thing I can't swim...I'm diabetic.
What's the one thing you would take with you if you were trapped on a dessert island?
But my doctor told me to limit the sugar in my diet.
Sorry, I'm on a diet.
Yes, I'd rather be stranded in the dessert aisle.
It could be a trick, sugar doesn't float.
At least this island is low-fat.
I thought you said Caribbean, not Carb-Island.
When I flipped the Card it said "go back to start" . . . What's your story?
Our break is over. Let's go back.
That was sweet.  Now let's bring back to the one with the women.
I'm not falling for that witch's trick again.
On the plus side, we get unlimited salad bar.
I'd love to but sweets make me breakout.
If we both concentrate real hard maybe we can make it drift over here
Don't be fooled - all that stuff is bad for you.
And I thought this island was deserted.
And that was the end of the good ship Lollipop ...
Well, we get to see where bonbons play on the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay
Now that's a Dessert-ed Island I would  
NOT mind being stranded on
Off by one "S"...
I’m betting it’s a sea monster.  But, you’re the optimist, go for it!
I know, right? What are the odds we'd both have blood sugar issues?
I'm thinking it might be a trap.
And if they're not sugar free?
There should be enough fat in that donut to float us to at least Hawaii
But when it’s gone, it’s gone!
Now THAT is definitely fake news.
Maybe it’s an illusion, but if I see Sammy Davis Jr., I’m swimming over!
According to legend it was once inhabited by a tribe of misfit toys. This is all that's left of their civilization.
Stanley, this is not the visualization that we agreed upon...
I'm just worried about what my dentist would say.
You said the palm tree looked closer
The theme park hallucination was better.
Still... No milk.
It's better to eat nothing than junk food, right?
What happened to the eight guys who swam over?
Out of all the places for the North Pole to shift...
I’m starting to regret we went with the paleo option
Hey, now that is a Desert Island!
I just don’t think this is the best week to go Keto.
Desert, one S. Dessert, 2 S's. And you think spelling doesn't matter."
I've never fully appreciated that game until now.
I'm trying to decide if it's worth the calories.
I'm sorry.  I really thought it was spelled with one "s."
What I wish is for you to grow up
Pretty sweet, dude.
I suspect Amelia Earhart died from diabetes.
I knew I should have used spell-check...
I bet it's owned by a politician.
Welcome to Diabetes Island.
I don’t even know what’s real anymore. They could be ‘alternative snacks’.
Did we really pay extra for this view?
The diet requires some self control, but I don't think that should be much of a problem.
... we shouldn't have banished Willy!
I actually don’t even like sweets.
Damn, I wish we could swim.
We should have done a more thorough Air B&B search for this "island seclusion" trip.
And my third wish was I chose you.
The punishment was all the more cruel because of their coconut allergy.
You know, that there dessert island was once a PIEninsula.
Well Ralph, we finally bonded. We're having the same hallucination!
That figures, we’ve been pulling up Swedish fish for weeks.
Honestly, I would have preferred the dessert'd one.
You didn't tell me that you had ordered ile flottante for dessert.
Go ahead.  I'm fasting this week.
It would have never occurred to me that climate change would mean we'd die and go to Candy Land.
He's just trying to compete with the good ship Lollipop!
I'm disappointed.  I thought the good ship Lollypop stopped there.
I finally understand the 'Medicare for all' debate.
And me without a toothbrush.
Is dessert-ed a word?
I moved over here when my A1C reached the danger level.
Let's just call GrubHub.
Darn, I wanted the pizza delivered first.
No thanks, I'm borderline diabetic.
“Here comes the good ship Lollipop.”
The cruelty of it all is that I lost my toothbrush.
Desert or dessert?
Trust me: once you’ve been on the No Sugar diet a month, the cravings will go away.
Damn. I was wishing for The Good Ship Lollipop!
The Joneses just have different tastes than we do.
Next year ,5 star all inclusive.
Of course it’s a funny looking rescue ship, so what ?
When you type “dessert island” instead of “desert island”
I'm really starting to hate Martha Stewart.
I don't think I'm gluten free anymore.
Yes! For the last time, ''dessert island' - I get it!
Well? Still glad you didn't cash in the extra 10 thousand miles?
Dessert island not desert island!
Why are you looking at the other survivors like that?"
PAY NO ATTENTION, IT'S ONLY THE SHARKS.  THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SUCKER US IN.
Fyre Fest VII will be different, you said...
Funny...The only difference between here and there is an 's'.
I guess we're not the only things baking in this sun
This reminds me of the view of the city from my place in Jersey.
I would.... but I really want to stick with this gluten-free diet.
Diabetes or starvation? You decide.
It's not a mirage. It's pre-production for Season 38 - Survivor: Candy Land.
Yes but it wasnt MY new years resolution
I told you "dessert" has two S's!
Figures that would appear right after I give up sugar for Lent.
Maybe Mom was right about swim lessons coming in handy one day.
Let's do another juice cleanse instead.
Now that's what I call all inclusive.
They’re killing themselves with that stuff.
So? The appetizer, soup and entree atolls were also buffet style.
Ok, let’s go, but remember the one bite rule!
I thought the island was deserted, not desserted.
Trevor actually got a little over half way.
maybe so, but I'm still going for it.
This is what's left from the Good Ship Lollipop?
We’ve the wrong kind of dessert island
I've been having these bizarre dreams about Shirley Temple lately.
I don't think it's worth the calories.
I get that, but there are rare circumstances when bad carbs are actually good carbs.
My nutritionist always said sweets would be my undoing.
The joke is on the sharks, we're diabetic.
You called Uber Eats and all you could think of was to order a dessert tray?
Wish we were on the misspelled island.
Candyland always looked more inviting in the board game.
Did we miss the entr'ee?
I will swim for cake. You?
It’s all yours. I’m on a low sugar diet.
Funny, usually there's a swarm of people around the dessert island.
Too bad you're off sugar.
I said "desserted island", not "deserted island"!
It's called Christmas Island for a reason.
It's a mirage or alternatively perhaps we are.
Is that what a wall looks like?
Looks like the Good Ship Lollypop hit a sandbar.
I've heard of mirage, but never meringue.
Three more days till I complete my Sugar Free January!
"Tell me the difference between 'there,' 'they're' and 'their' and then I'll believe you MEANT to choose this island."
Feh!  I'm more of a meat and potatoes guy myself.
My teeth hurt
Ah, sweet redemption.
We had a choice.. sugar or palm oil.  No point having second thoughts.
The cartoonist thinks he's funny. It's––DESSERTED.
I've always dreamed of getting to the Big Rock Candy Island.
NOW can we invent a boat?
I'm ready to take the bitter with the sweet
Why couldn’t we be stuck on a dessert-ed island?
It's gotta be real, mirages are only in cartoons.
The island is always sweeter on the other side of the channel.
No carrot cake, bummer.
I hear they die young... but happy.
On the bright side, we'll have plenty of time to study that list of commonly misspelled words.
I remember before global warming there used to be a land bridge
Christmas Island no doubt.
Sometimes I wish I weren't on the Paleo Diet....
Our good luck!  We’ve landed right by the big rock candy atoll.
Dessert Island,so near,yet so far.
Look at it this way: our island is deserted too.
For want of an “s” we starve.
Milk and honey” was so 3,600 years ago.
That'll wreak havoc with our Paleo diet.
You'd think we would've crashed over there.
We should open a dentist hut
Guess we picked the wrong time to go paleo.
We should have sailed with the Good Ship Lollipop!
Look on the bright side — at least we won’t die from diabetes.
These 'pop-up' stores are getting out of hand.
As your dentist, i have to recommend you not to do it.
So Gretel, what are the chances?
It happened this morning.  The ship was the SS Lollypop.
You know it could just be cannibals teasing us.
I can’t eat all that junk food.
Let's go there for our honeymoon.
And we have to be on the desert island!
Sometimes I wish I wasn’t a vegan.
What are you in the mood for?
I know it is close but I have never been much for sweets.
Once it has cooled down we can swim across the hot chocolate and get somthing to eat....
We picked the wrong week to quit sugar.
I call this the Island Diet
I would have much preferred a Tapas Isle to a Dessert Isle.
I could really go for a burger right now.
Over there, I heard the tribal council does not judge.
I guess it's a desert island.
Ya, and just over the horizon is Rock Candy Mountain.
I dunno...I've been trying to cut back on sugar.
Well, we're out of coconuts, you want to try swimming over to that dessert island?
Would it still be deserted if we were on it?
Might be time to rethink your paleo diet.
Had to forget the extra S, didn’t you, Bob?
Hey - Desert island. Dessert Island. It's close. Give me a break.
I hear they’re building a wall and we’re paying for it.
Yet another mirage on the rocks.
Well at least we have something to look forward to.
I don't think we're dressed for it
It's probably all made from soy.
If I knew it was gluten-free I'd swim for it
I never envisioned Candyland as an island, did you?
I've heard of crash diets, but this is ridiculous.
This is when I hate the gluten-free thing.
No, you meant a dessert-ed island? Hilarious, Universe.
You really see it too?
On the bright side, your cholesterol levels are fabulous.
I told you The Good Ship Lollipop wasn’t a good choice for our vacation.
But no, Big Rock Candy Mountain wasn't good enough for you. You had to insist on a cruise.
Any chance you're a dentist?
This is better then TV, yesterday it was a bikini contest!
The crew of the Good Ship Lollipop trashed it.
You go. I'm doing Atkins.
Darn that autocorrect!
Its so retro.
...if only I’d paid attention in spelling class!
I’d settle for the Good Ship
Lollipop.
Don’t go there. It’s the modern Circe’s island. You eat, turn fat and orange, and start spouting nonsensical policy ideas like the need to dissolve the post WW2 western alliance.
Looks really good, but I gave up sweets for lent.
Remember, Palm Beach Diet
...but is it a rescue, or just another alien-abduction trick?
You see, I always knew in my heart the Candyland was a real place.
I mean sure, that's nice if you go for that sort of thing.
Do you think they have anything that is lactose and gluten free?
Do you have to be getting back, or shall I pour you a glass of wine?
Can we use this homophone to call for help?
Ready for another swim?
Nah, I’m trying to cut back on carbs.
Moses....At low tide we walk!
They’re survivors from the Good Ship Lollipop
Is it possible you misspelled the destination? I think a dessert island sounds like more fun.
Diabetic huh? Bummer.
Do you think they’re made with organic, fair trade sugar?
Oh man, I think my insulin went down with the ship!
Is that one 's' or two?
Now you have children designing their own submarines.
And the rising seas,
Killed the cigarette trees 
and the lemonade springs
Where no bluebirds sing
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains!
I see it. Do you see it, too?
It's a vegan bakery - don't bother.
Seems like spelling _did_ count.
Just wait, pretty soon we’ll see the Good Ship Lollipop.
Mirage or not..you're diabetic.
I'll go over first.....
How it feels in the first week while dieting
I'm here to study the predatory strategies of giant mollusks. You?
You say "desert." I say "dessert." Desert, dessert, desert, dessert. Let’s call the whole thing off!
Go figure. Germs everywhere. Look at that half-eaten donut.
Do you think our kids will be upset if we don't save them anything?
But our island is vegan.
Sure, it's tempting, but I'm saving myself for the beach.
OK, my turn. Something beginning with “C”.
You go. I'm more of a savory gal.
All wax, it's a Japanese island.
I can't believe you traded our raft for a half dozen cupcakes.
I told you Trump would save us.
That definitely doesn't look like a Russian sub to me!
I'm sticking to South Beach.
I'll race you for the cake.
You go if you want, I'm doing Keto.
I can never remember. Is it one 's' or two?
Oh great, the only good thing about being marooned was losing fifty pounds.
Told you I was spelling it right.
Maybe we should not have sailed on the Good Ship Lollpop
I see Willy Wonka survived the plane crash also.
It's okay to have one cheat day.
It's the old two-palm tree mirage trick.
The Good Ship Lollipop just completely ignored us!
To die of hunger or to die of obesity?
But are they gluten-free?
I'd rather be stranded on a desserted island.
Welcome to America, Jerry.
Nah, you go ahead. I’m on a diet.
I don't trust it.
If you say that "grass is greener" thing one more time you're going for a swim!
When I was a kid, long before the cruise ship sank, I believed 'Candy Land' was only a board game.
You go.  I'm on a gluten-free diet.
But is it gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO and sustainably produced?
I told you before you wished that dessert was spelled with 2 “s”s!
Desserted is not a word,bruh.
We can swim over but we will never make it back.
Restraint is the ultimate trip, bro.
At least you spelled it ‘isle’ and not ‘aisle’.
I can't, I'm on the South Beach Diet.
You're right.  It is a great view.
I understand the estate of Michael Jackson has plans for it.
They say sugar is more deadly than smoking.
I’m not a big sweets person.
Let’s invite our neighbors over for coffee.
My inner child is hallucinating again.
I heard it's from the wreck of The Good Ship Lollipop.
Oh, the difference one letter can make.
I’m staying here.  Look at it! Over the top, and not a single palm tree.  And, I bet it has ants.
What, no cigarette trees!
Looks good, but there's no coconut tree.
Just goes straight to the thighs, man.
Yeah, dude, my mom wanted me to take swimming lessons too.  But I had just got my new joystick system.
It's Amazon's new dessert delivery service.
No I can’t. I’m diabetic.
Who would have ever thought you'd be able to swim to the top of Big Rock Candy Mountain.
That must be the good breast.
It's just as well. My dentist told me to cut back on sweets.
Imagine what it’s like to be stranded on a dessert island
Unfortunately, that Island isn't on Atkins.  I'll wait for the Steak and Cheese Island to float by.
Candy "Crash" level one!
You can go. I've got better things to do.
Distractions aside, what did you think of Roma?
Something tells me they aren't gluten free.
Unfortunately, I don't see an insulin island nearby.
I understand the natives are part of a carbo cult.
If ifs and buts were candy and nuts...
Man it’s never easy to stick with the low-carb isle
That? It's the Island of Discarded Fruitcakes
Think the Goodship Lollipop is in the vicinity?
We picked a hell of a time to go on a diet.
Too bad you're a vegan!
Aren't you glad we're doing keto?
Well, there goes the neighborhood!
Being stranded on a dessert island sounds does sound better, but just think of the empty carbs.
You go ahead. I'm trying to cut back on carbs.
If that’s the Big Rock Candy Mountain, then this might be the lake of gin we can both jump in!
I would but that kind of stuff goes straight to my hips.
Honestly, I can't tell if it's the dehydration or my sweet tooth talking.
Disney got into the submarine business when sea level started rising.
I'd rather be marooned on a dessert island,as well."
Empty calories. No thanks.
I know it's a mirage, but it smells great!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE HULA GIRLS WHO WERE OVER THERE LAST WEEK?
I suspect shark bait.
Once we get there, we can build a Good Ship Lollypop.
I’m positive the brochure said “Spend a sweet week on our DESSERT  island”
Nah, I don't want to spoil my appetite."
It seems enticing, but all those refined sugars will kill you.
But we’re vegans, Charles.
With our luck it is probably vegan.
Look at all the calories we're saving.
The sweetest temptation is sitting next to me."
Must definitely be inhabited, don't you think ?
this is the last time I use an on-line Travel Agen
I really shouldn't.  I just started the keto diet.
There go the neighbors — showing off their decorating skills again.
There goes the Good Ship Lollipop.
Be carful, No ones ever came back from there!
Unreal, even my mirages are childlike.
I keep waiting for bathing suit season to end.
I would argue that it’s actually a triple entendre...
Well, my New Year's resolution was to eat more sugar.
You go.  I’m allergic to gluten.
I'd chance it, but I'm already pre-diabetic.
Human flesh is much healthier
This South Beach diet sucks”
I say fuck the Jones’s
The candy isle always looks so good.
Waiting until cheat day is so much harder now.
But such a convenient delusion.
We got the only genie who was hard of hearing.
Only half a donut?
You know, being stuck on a desserted island isn't such a bad idea!
#1 I'm staying here. I just lost 30 lbs!
I guess we booked the bad ship lollipop
Nobody ever told me that palm leaves are loaded with THC.
Not having a toothbrush really bugs me.
Yeah, it may seem like a good idea, but we'll just get a cramp swimming back.
Talk about bad luck - We end up trapped on a desert island... right next to a DESSERT island.
(This caption is for Feb.11 snake cartoon - due to weather conditions in the U.P., my New Yorker just arrived today)

" At this point, Mr. Fenner, I'm going to suggest that you switch back to the comfort dog."
It's one of the Calari Islands
What makes you think you’re living on a game board
Can you swim?
Bon Jovi.
I would bring Bon Jovi’s greatest hits. 
Wait what was your question?
I swear,that's all I think about.
With our luck they won't be gluten free.
I said I wanted to be stuck on a desert island with Candy,not candy.
Not today I'm fasting
Yeah I know, but for a real castaway experience it’s our little island hands down!
Did you remember to bring the diabetes medication?
Now I wish one of us had learned to swim.
Tempting, but I'm on Atkins..
Taking into account the swim and the fast, I think I can finally justify the calories.
Doesn’t faze me. I’m on keto this month.
Let's not.  It's bad for our tooth.
OK, and now I'll make it disappear
Last one there gets the stupid candy canes.
So you're just telling me now that spelling matters ...
When, did you say, is our cheat day?
The dancing girls should start in about 15 minutes.
I'm not sure yet. Either we're hallucinating or we're being gentrified out of our ocean.
But, I have to carbohydrate load BEFORE I swim.
Now I know why the real estate price was cheaper over here.
Given the circumstances, I think we should take our chances with diabetes.
Wouldn't you know it - I just started my diet.
Dammit, Steve. I told you it was the island with two S's.
We’ll burn off the calories on the swim back
I'm never really been a dessert guy.
We can die here or die later after eating all that sugar.
You have to wait another 30 minutes.
You had to spell-check it, didn’t you!
HTTP status 404 error. Re-direct. Load <desert_Island>.
I'll bet everyone there dreams about having some of our coconut filling.
Day 202: at least we now have a sweet view
Yeah, but they are empty calories.
I told you there was such a thing as a DESSERT island!
I believe that's the Good Ship Lollipop's port of call.
Have you ever felt as though you were a pawn in someone elses’s board game?
I wonder if any of that is gluten free.
I hear Amazon pulled out.
Bruh, this honeymoon sucks.
We’re gonna need a dentist.
And here I thought that Diabetes Island was a only a myth.
I don't see any shark fins, wanna go for it?
At least we won’t have to worry about anyone wanting to eat US.
Day 23: Despite recent studies on refined carbohydrates, Dessert Island is starting to look like an almost reasonable alternative
'LOST' was never this confusing.
Amazon now delivers by island drone."
This diet is gonna kill us.
Just keep an eye out for the Good Ship Lollipop.
It's probably just a see food mirage.
It's tempting, but I'm doing keto.
I'm positive I typed 'dessert island.'  Stupid autocorrect!
You go right ahead.  The boat sinking almost killed me, and heck if I’ll let heart disease finish the job.
Huh, candy island. Bummer we don't have life savers to get us there.
I thought you said you wished for a boat.
You always were a lousy speller!  Be careful what you wish for—THAT’S a desserted island!!!
I could easily make the swim, but I'm diabetic.
wish we landed on the desserted island...
Yeah but, there's really no shade!
The original South Beach diet
It'd be easier if you imagined kale.
I don’t know, I’m not really a sweets guy...
I told you before you made your wish, stress the second syllable, the second syllable!
Which is the one with two s’s again?
You're on a diet too?  What luck.
Had to correct the captain didn't you: It's pronounced 'Desert' Island.
are you saying I'm fat?
You go. I’ve sworn off sweets
It's either a Good Ship Lollipop shipwreck or a Candy Crush mirage.
Just when I'm trying to cut down on sweets.
I sure wish I hadn't given up sweets for Lent.
It can't be a mirage, because I hate candy canes.
My physician told me to avoid sweets...that I would live longer. But what do they know?
Keep in mind, no artificial flavors or preservatives were added to our island.
I finally figured out the catch...sand everywhere, and no moist towelettes in sight.
My hallucinations are defintely sweeter.
But I did spellcheck the travel request!
Remember, we're vegan now.
Life...it’s not all sugar and spice...
No, thanks.  I’m doing low-carbs, no sugar.  But you should go.
It's real, but I swear every flavor is coconut.
Sadly, it's all that's left of the Good Rock Candy Mountain.
Ohhh, I just got it!
I landed on a chute that dropped me here.  You?
If you weren't such a stickler for spelling we'd be a lot better off.
This gluten-free diet is killing me.
You up for another game of Candy Land?
Yeah, but I keep hearing that 'Seems too good to be true'  in my head
Don't get your hopes up. 'Could be a dessert island. 'Could be the good ship Lollipop. Either way we're still marooned.
Hey, that candy island is back.
Just one more "S" and we could have been stranded over there instead of here.
If only we knew how to swim.
We ARE on candy island... the Vikings named that one Salt Island as a deterrent...
There’s gotta be a shark.
Funny, I had this exact hallucination one week into Keto.
Too bad we can't swim."  "Oh, no, too bad you can't swim.
Actually, there are no specific guidelines for when your cheat day
should occur.
It's just another one of their fake views.
OK, Willy Wonka, what now?
There's fewer calories in the off-season!
You'll never get your A1C down with hallucinations like that.
Don't do it, that stuff will kill you.
Do whatever you want... all I see is gluten.
I've heard the broker is really sugar-coating the amenities.
Guess where I’d be right now if I weren’t diabetic.
You go ahead  - I'm strictly paleo this month.
Don’t worry, they’ll see it.
A boy swam over from the other island once. He called himself the Lord of the Pies.
It’s either the Good Ship Lollipop; or a mirage.
We lost the butterscotch bridge last year and scientists are predicting that the peppermints may be next.
Should we start swimming or you are still on your "10 day no carb challenge"?
Do you think they have universal healthcare?
Well, they look GMO to me.
The carbs alone will kill you, Tim.
Good ship lollipop my butt!
I guess that this truly is a deserted island.
I couldn't make it past the swedish fish.
It’s not that I don’t like your fantacy, I’m just saying I can’t swim and I’m diabetic.
Unfortunately I’m diabetic
I told you we should have waited for a decent mirage to come along and not settled for this dumb tree.
You swim?
If there were grass,it would be greener.
I thought CandyLand  was a game.
I really wish I'd read Life of Pi.
Oh, it's all great until Lord Licorice kicks your ass.
Pretty sweet, asymmetrically speaking.
I think "gluten free" is the least of our problems.
I can't believe the Amazon driver screwed up so badly!
Dude, I'm OK with the mirage, but I'm disturbed about the irony of the strawberry on the cake?
You go on ahead, I am dieting.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Sugar high?
A third candy cane would make a more pleasing presentation.
No thanks, I don't like to eat sweets before a big meal.
With a whiff of coffee I'd be there in a jiffy
Well, I guess this means survival of the fattest!
In your mirage you see sweets.  In mine, I see a sexy woman.
I mean it's technically just one cheat meal, right? Let's go for it.
My hallucinations are giving me diabetes
Don’t worry! The Keto hallucinations go away after the first week!
I thought I requested a dessert island experience, not a desert island experience, but I put too much trust in my spell checker.
Sure am glad we're here, cuz that sh**'ll kill ya
I'm not falling for it, the sugar over there will kill you.
It's a trap! Sugar never saved anyone!
Forget it ... they don't use raw cacao.
I picked a poor time to start a no-sugar diet.
I suppose the main dish might still be coming.
When they offered ‘desert island’ or ‘dessert island,’ I thought it was Hobson’s choice.
Too bad we gave up sweets for lent.
My trainer would kill me .....
We should weigh the pros and cons before we just up and move.
It is low sugar induced mirage ...not a parallel universe
It's all for the best anyway. I'm on an Atkins diet.
What we call the new South Beach Diet.
I wish I listened to my mother and took swimming lessons.
But note they don't have coconut.
It's the good ship, Lollipop!
Dessert has 2 s’s. Why?
Don't you have a dental appointment next week?
How long do think that doughnut will float?
I would, but I just went Keto
The carbs are real.
I wonder if they're vegan.
I’m not sure we need the calories.
I hear it's being scouted as the location for the next seven seasons of Survivor
I could be a mirage.  Let's wait 'til he tide goes out and walk over
You still on paleo?
You go ahead, I'm on a sugar-free diet.
My glucose level might handle the sugar on the island, but swimming through maple syrup is a deal breaker.
Not even if the ocean were fluoridated.
Why couldn't we be stranded on a dessert island instead of a desert island?
It must have been dropped off by the good ship Lollipop.
I heard whoever wins this survivor challenge gets diabetes.
Just my luck, my cheat day was yesterday
Well we have the sweeter view"
But, dude, palm sugar has a lower glycemic index and may make you feel fuller for longer...
Do we get a cheat day?
I would, but I gave up swimming for Lent.
Yeah, but I heard the healtcare insurance over there is very bad.
Oh no! It's the President's imagination again!
The new neighbors have all the luck
If we swim over there and eat it, we'll  just crash again in a couple hours.
The ad actually did say “Cruise the Carbibean” but I assumed it was a typo.
Why couldn't we get stuck on the dessert isle?
Of all the deserted islands I could be on, I'm glad I'm on the one with you.
This sort of thing always happens on my fast days.
This cruise for diabetics was a horrible idea
Do you think a pun makes it more likely we'll be rescued?
I should have known, what with my sweet tooth, that my hallucinations would not involve sex.
Dessert Island’s a metaphor for the most insatiable hunger hidden in the darkest corners of our souls. The gumdrops represent cannibalism…namely because they’re made of human flesh. The candy canes are beastiality. It’s pretty fucked up over there.
Maybe we could swim over later for dessert.
If that is Temptation Island, then I think I know where we are.
We sure could use the Good Ship Lollipop!
Objects may appear closer than they are, y'know...
I should have played more Candyland.
Do you think that fish contained hallucinogens ?
Please, enough about nutritional value.
It must be a niche bakery that caters to the stranded!
I told you we should have double checked the spelling first.
It is a mirage. There is no water.
Good thing we're vegan.
Looks nice but no one has survived there longer than a few weeks.
So let it be a lesson to you. Don’t rely on spellcheck.
Between the jellyfish and lemon sharks, I'm fine right here.
Your parents have a warped sense of humor.
This is the most effective diet I've ever done.
It's the Island of Misfit Desserts.
I checked, none of them are gluten-free.
That must be cheat day island
Yes, I can see how, in your weakened state, that seems like Nirvana.
But Marx tells us, that is just an ephemeral representation  of proletariat naivety.
Looks like the Dylan’s pop-up is finally open.
It's what I like to call island time meets dessert time.
Sweet island, man.
The Good Ship Lollipop must be on the way.
That looks like a pretty sweet place.
Maybe it’s the dehydration, but have you considered we might be cake toppers on the tropical episode of Bake Wars?
They know it's my birthday.
Are you seeing this too?
Our exile will end when there’s a new Lord of the Pies.
Can't swim either. How long do you think before the Uber Boat arrives?
Yes, I know, but it's probably inhabited by a cannibalistic old witch.
We’ve been here too long or not long enough.
I don’t see the Twinkie.
I always thought the Big Rock Candy Mountain would be bigger.
Figures they were rescued by the Good Ship Lollipop.
DESERT ISLAND? DESSERT ISLAND? YOU DECIDE.
I wish those survivors from The Good Ship Lollipop had washed up on our island
I can never remember which.  Are we stranded on the desert or the dessert island?
Eat healthy" they said,"dude,Diabetes Island looks so much more fun to me
I’m holding onto a few things while I figure out if they spark joy or not.
You just had to tell the travel agent you were gluten free, didn't you?
Don't worry... I'm a dentist.
I spy something sweet.
If you were on a dessert-ed island, what would you eat first?
Maybe it was a mistake to go paleo.
Just remember  we chose  the  nuts
I think we better not go there, our health plan doesn't cover dental.
Maybe we'll get lucky and those processed foods will kill us.
Just my luck to have a salty tooth.
If that thing is due to a spelling error, then maybe the universe really is a simulation.
Damn auto-correct—I thought I’d booked the package with the “dessert island,” but no buffet for us.
What a difference one little ‘s’ makes ...
Does that make this a palm treed island, then?
The mermaids I could take, but this is really beyond the pale.
I don't know. My doctor says too much sugar will kill me.
Nah, let‘s wait for the cheese island to swim by. I‘m on a sugar-free diet.
A lot of difference between a “Dessert Island” and
a  “Deserted Island” !!!
So you’re type 1 too?
It's too bad we gave up candy for lent.
Makes me kinda sorry we're vegan.
It’s not worth the calories.
I’m switching to the North Beach diet.
Damn, Sammy Davis Jr. singing the Candyman is going to be in my head all day.
Hey, these hallucinations are pretty sweet.
So, Candy Land is real!
It's the Good Ship Lollipop, which means we're not lost Stan, we're on the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay
Well. There's only one way to find out for sure.
I'm telling you! They just have a REALLY good marketing department!
but we have coconuts!
Diabetes sucks, man!
Poor spelling aside, let's swim over to the desserted  island.
That much sugar can’t be good for you anyway.
I'll understand. But please don't try to come back.
Look on the bright side.  At least we don't have to worry about dental decay!
If only we had insulin!
Water water everywhere and not a drop of milk.
The good news is it's zero calorie... The bad news is it's a mirage.
Well that finally proves it. When I was little, I really did know how to spell dessert island.
So there it is, Christmas Island!
Now why couldn't we have been stranded on that "desserted" island?
I really shouldn't. I didn't finish my dinner!
Dessert for the Deserted.
Stupid auto correct. I typed dessert not desert.
You didn't finish your dinner.
If only we'd been shippwrecked, we could've ended up on a dessert island instead.
Where's the good ship Lollypop?
Did we miss the Good Ship Lollipop?
Tell me you’re not a dentist
No, you can't sing The Good Ship Lollipop just one more time
There's only one 's' in deserted.
But what if it's coconut?
That's how we get drawn into the water.
Sure, we could make it, but think of the calories!
I'm sorry. I only played Chutes and Ladders as a kid.
No, no, it’s all you man. I’m on Keto.
What do you think? Hallucination or alien spaceship?
We need to keep our bodies in beach shape, Bro.
Should we wait for the Good Ship Lollipop or chance it in Peppermint Bay?
Admit it. It’s better the the shark mirage.
I don't remember seeing Main Course Island, do you?
Just our luck to miss the "Dessert Isle!"
I only hang on to fantasies that spark joy.
Gotta be careful with genies. I asked for my own island, they asked for the sweet life.
It's either a mirage or the Good Ship Lollypop capsized.
But hold on
It may spoil our appetite
Either its a mirage or we should learn to swim
They don't call this 'the Carbbean Sea' for nothing.
And you're SURE today is Yom Kippur?
Wow, life really does get sweeter ahead
That is the mirage that appears when I am on a diet.
Maybe it's a hallucination in the form of an ironic homophone, but it's worth a swim to check it out.
- What if they're not vegan?
And to think, the only thing that we have to eat are mushrooms.
I know what you think. But I'm quite sure this one had the far better yelp rating.
I never realized sharks are so creative."
Yes, But think of our dental health!
I’d go for it but I’m gluten free.
Why did we sign up for the damn Wellness Retreat?
This view is not helping me with this fast.
I left my toothbrush at home.
It's a mirage let's eat the whole thing; there's no calories.
I knew this carb free diet would never last.
And we're here stuck on a deserted island.
I hate this diet!
I think I'd rather be on a dessert island than a desert island.
Tank, can we get a spellcheck on 'desert island'?
I could never live there.  No protein.
They’re tough to swallow but once they kick in they’re the best mushrooms on the island!
Candy is dandy, but a cruise ship would be quicker...
Now I wish I took those swimming lessons
If your spelling wasn't so bad, we could be marooned on a dessert island like that one over there.
Think about what you’ll leave behind.
No question you can get there.  But I will bet on if you can make it back.
My mirage is a little more whimsical.
I hear that UBER is working on an island-to-island delivery app.
I would, but I’m Paleo.
Do you think there are any women on that island?
I don't do gluten or refined sugar; I had a bad experience with my sister Gretel when we were growing up.
Yeah, I try to steer clear of anything with palm oil.
Now that's a "desserted" island I could really enjoy!
Maybe we shouldn’t have marketed it as a desserted island.
At least we have each other.
I think I hear Shirley Temple singing.
Ok, I’ll have the pretend cupcake, what will you have?
The brochure said 'All you can eat desserts and bar.'" 
"I think you misread it.
Diabetic.  You?
Dang it. I just cut out sugar.
That's the real reason why fish wanted to walk on land.
No I don't get the pun. Why don't you explain it to me again?
Of all weeks to start a gluten free diet!
You go ahead. I have a gluten allergy.
The candy always seems sweeter on the other deserted island
Your text said we were going to the DESSERT island.
And just beyond that is an island with a stereo and ten records.
And all this time we thought it was "The Big Rock Candy Mountain"...
Fantasy Island.
You still doing keto?
Well, We can't go until we find the dinner island first!
We better hurry.  They're going to build a fence.
It was on Fixer Upper.
Pity you're a gluten free diabetic who can't swim.
Where else would you rather be?
But no!  You had to be worried about  your dental work!
If you're really concerned about the calories...How about afterwards, we go for a nice swim.
We need the Good  Ship Lollipop
This is a desert island. That's a dessert deception.
Remind me to make a dental appointment
This reminds me of how my parents couldn't afford to take us kids to Disney World.
I'm sorry Kent, the Weight Watchers membership was a cruel anniversary gift.
On the bright side, we’ll burn off all those calories.
Funny thing—ever since I became a pescatarian sweets just don’t appeal to me.
If only I weren't on the Atkins diet, I would swim over.
It's a stop on the Cruise Ship 'Lollipop.'
And we had to book the deserted isle...
I guess God doesn't use spell check
Don’t mess with a confectioner shark.”
We'll burn the calories right off.
The Big Rock Candy Mountain was cool, before climate change"
I mean, it is greener.
Here it comes again.
Well, if you wanted a ‘desserted’ island, you should’ve spelled it with two ‘s’es.
Unfortunately it's refined sugar
One more "s" and we'd be there.
I heard that Mexico will pay for it.
Now that's what I call a mirage.
Tomato, tomato.
Sorry, I could never remember whether it was "s" or double "s".
Desert, dessert--you could spell it either way.
probably not gluten-free anyway......
Now this Wonka fella is just being spiteful.
I guess we picked a bad time to go paleo.
Sure, we could swim for it but we don’t want to ruin our appetite for when we’re rescued.
it’s not exactly the big rock candy mountain
Wouldn't you know it.  Help finally arrives, and I'm diabetic.
I think that island was booked by the more expensive cruise line.
You go ahead, I'm doing Keto.
Let's just stay over here...sugar makes me bloat.
It's life's illusions I recall....
We had to discover the diet island.
‘Enticing, yes, but we don’t have dental coverage.’
It's probably all high fructose corn syrup anyway.
We haven’t been out here long enough if that’s the best mirage we can conjure up.
Let’s swim over to that desserted island.
You're the one who chose the no carb option.
Ignore it. Its a corn syrup ad; Mirage.com is monetizing their streaming content
I hate my mother for making me learn to spell.
Only if 
We could 
Build 
A
Wall
So near and yet so far...
I wonder what they think of us
I know there’s a wicked witch in there, somewhere.
So where’s the good ship Lollipop?
I ordered it from Amazon. How do you like it?
My dentist would get a kick out of this.
It's just as well. They're probably not gluten free.
"With our luck, there'll be veggies on the other side."
That's deserted island...one S
Damn one-percenters.
Now, don't you wish you had taken those swimming lessons?
Nothing over there is vegan, dude.
As long as its a delusion, I'd rather wait until we spot Asparagus Island!
Counter-point: I bet they don't have any dentists.
Kick back and enjoy the mirage.
It's called Stevia island.  It's just a mirage.
It’s a good thing we landed on Gumdrop Mountain before global warming flooded Candyland!
Dude, it gets sweeter when you squint!
All-inclusive should include us, Fred.
If only we had a Chute or a Ladder...
OK, let's do it again. 
This time we'll add in the Mermaids.
You go ahead.  I'm watching my figure.
Meh... Even the candy canes are coconut.
Well Pat- we can either eat sweet ...or die tryin'
And neither of us can swim!
…yeah, but we have all seven Harry Potter books.
It’s not worth the empty calories.
I'm not sure giving up carbs was the right decision.
I guess I forgot to add the 's'  when I was making my wish.
You go ahead. I’m watching my carbs.
Don't get excited--it's not The Good Ship Lollipop.
Be honest. Do you really like it here as much as at your mom's?
So what I’m basically hearing is that that wasn’t chocolate we just ate.
That's not the Floating Island I ordered. And where's my espresso?
Forget about a desert oasis- I’ll take a dessert oasis any day!
How fortunate our shipwreck took place in the Straits of Diabetes.
Yea ... But do they have cocoanuts !
Their theme was better than ours.
The grass isn't always greener. Sometimes it's cake.
I know it's tempting but it'll totally ruin my diet.
They’re empty calories.
I knew we should’ve gone to Stormi’s party instead of Fyre Festival.
What, and risk dying from cavities and tooth decay?  No thanks.
Yeah, so what do you think, dude - does 'random candy island' go in the 'we're probably in heaven' or the 'we're probably in hell' column?
I'm beginning to think maybe we're not in the Mediterranean after all.
Awww, that's sweet.
None for me, thanks. I'm on the keto diet.
What if we swim there and it’s actually all gluten free?
Amazingly, there isn't a shred of coconut on their island."
I always preferred Chutes and Ladders.
Climate change at the Big Rock Candy Mountains
What, and risk diabetes.
I hope it's the good ship Lollipop and not just a hallucination!
I thought it was a little under priced for a Desserted Island.
Your obsession with Candy Crush is becoming a serious issue.
You go ahead, for some reason my dignity still matters.
The candy is always sweeter on the other island...
Nah. . .I'm waiting for filet mignon and a bottle of Pommard.
I think it will drive down property values.
They were salvaged from the Good Ship Lollipop before it sank.
And you said spelling didn't matter
Don't fall for it.  It is not a desserted island.
And I had to pick this week to go off sweets.
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain!
I told you low carb would be hard
Looks like they want to surprise us.
Candy is dandy but liquor would really be a whole lot quicker !
I told you about climate change!
You can go. I have diabetes...
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
The brochure promised we will lose weight faster here.
They're as scared of us as we are of them.
I'll bet $10 it's a mirage; but you'll have to swim over there to prove I'm wrong.
First one there gets the strawberry!
No thanks, it would go right to my thighs.
I'd been hoping for the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
How did we miss the Good Ship Lollypop?!
I can't, I'm doing a juice-cleanse.
Don’t be envious. After a while on a dessert island, the days grow stale.
The thing I miss most, really, is Candy Crush.
Last time I play Candy Land while watching "Black Mirror"!
No , you go ahead. I’m off carbs this week.
No, it's actually spelled differently.
I finally got Candy Crush to download.
''Looks like another unidentified frosted object.''
Sucks for us, Roy, but I guarantee there will be songs written about the Wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop.
I’m simply saying that our vision for the future shouldn’t be as consumerist and materialist as previous generations’...
The calories alone will kill us
I should have used spell checker for my wish list
Do you think the cupcake is gluten free?
I’’ll wait here. I’m on a low carb diet.
So you think the island is deserted. Is that with one "s" or two?
I thought "deserted island" wouldn't be so literal.
Sugar free or no gluten?  Oh, that's right... neither of us can swim.
Swim over if you want. I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake.
It came unstuck from a Disney theme park and it's all plastic.
OK, so it's not a mountain. But the part about "the sun shines every day" was true.
Think there's any salt-water taffy there?
You go ahead. I'm not doing carbs right now.
I hope the clown arrives before the guests.
True enough, but palm oil has numerous negative environmental consequences.
Seems like a lot of empty calories anyway.
That’s known as the hallucination diet.
Sure it looks tempting but I’m going to wait here for the Good Ship Lollipop.
Can't go. Diabetes.
Not for me. I am on the Paleo
I would, but I'm trying to stay Keto.
I know, Bill, but I’ve just always been more of a scone guy.
I'm beginning to think Darwin may have missed a few things.
Rotate.  Time to stare at the island of helicopters, jet packs and speed boats."
Well, at least the grass is greener on this side.
It would be a real treat to go to that island.
I’m glad the dolphins rescued us, but c’mon!
Personally, I’d rather be on the Appetizer Archipelago.
Do you have dental floss?
I was not specific enough during that desert island game
Dessert, desert - what's in an "s"?
Should we build a wall in case they decide to immigrate?
There's a woman on that island, but she's a real witch.
I'm trying to stay away from refined sugar.
By any chance, are you a dentist?
That's all that's left of the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Yes, we have no food, but who needs the empty calories?
It's only day one and I'm already seeing things.
You're no box of chocolates either!
Too bad we gave up carbs.
I would, but I’m gluten-free
We’re better off without the carbs.
Hungry?
I was sure "dessert" had only one S.
Think of your waistline!
Mirage or meringue?
And we just got our summer bodies back...
I still prefer meat, so I won't stop you.
Or Wilbur Ross is now running the Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue.
Yeah - I see it too! In fact, I started seeing it three days ago . . .
Personally, I prefer a non-deserted island.
I say we hit Entree Island first.
Rick, we're ON a desert island! Did you just wish for a dessert island?
I can't- I'm on a starvation diet.
You go. I'm diabetic.
I'm pretty sure the sharks put it there.
Our sugar daddy has arrived!
Funny how one ‘s’ makes so much difference.
It's a shame I'm still on my diet
I know what my dentist would say.
Since I’ve started keto, that really doesn’t appeal to me”
I say it's an illusion ... would you still want to try to make it there if those are vegetables?
You go, I don’t have enough points.
They were out of pizza.
Let's split that mirage down the middle!
Relax! It's the port of call for the good ship lollipop!
I'm off sugar and you have diabetes.
That's Christmas Island
They all died of diabetes.
I don’t know, I think I’ll stay here. I don’t want to get diabetes.
Well, I guess this means we're bringing the mains.
You think it's gluten-free?
I'm not so sure. Aren't you familiar with the paradox of choice?
If only I wasn't on a low-carb diet.
I wouldn’t touch that pun with a 110-foot pole.
Get ready to say good bye to our vegan diet.
There's gotta be some middle ground.
You know Tom, we could always just swim.
And you said I shouldn't bring LSD on the cruise.  Not so critical now, eh?
What are the odds those are gluten-free?
That would’ve been the sweeter real estate deal.
Is it really worth the calories?
I'd love to, but I haven't gotten my 10,000 steps in today.
Yeah.. true... but think of all those calories we are avoiding on our island.
It is a tantalizing oasis, yet rather predictably gauche.
So you don't see the sharks?
Ugh, that's going to affect property values.
For want of an additional 's' we could be over there.
I'm rethinking my pescatarian diet.
It's the flotsam and jetsam from the Good Ship Lollypop.
Do you think they have any cigarettes?
'Keto, Mike. Keto. We both committed to it.'
The guy there got stranded from The Good Ship Lollipop
Unfortunately I let my dental insurance lapse.
You texted for a Deserted Island not a Deserrted Island.
Are the Sugarplum Fairies dancing for you too?
At least the grass is no greener.
On the bright side staring at it doesn't cause cavities
The Good Ship Lollipop Went down around here.
We're being rescued by the Good Ship Lolipop?
Here's the thing, Zak: I ate a piece of your foot last night, and you're made of marzipan."
How should I know if it's gluten-free?
I call it sweetrification.
Not worth the risk. I’ve heard tales of deadly PIErates on these dessert islands.
I'd swim over there but I'm pre-diabetic.
So that's what happened to 'The Good Ship Lollipop'!
Do you think there’s an insulin dispenser as well?
No donut is an island . . .
Shark infested waters! That's the least of it. Just think what all those carbs will do to us!
Let’s just call it an ‘abandoned’ island so those mirages stop appearing.
Eye candy is best kept afar.
Okay. We're both diabetic...and we're both cannibals. Now what?
The Good Ship Lollipop can't be far behind.
For Christ's sake, Tim, we're out of dental floss.
It doesn't look as iconic as this island.
Looks like Bernie’s Campaign Committee is putting together their platform.
Looks great until the sharks chase you back.
God must’ve had autocorrect off when she made that one.
As Mick Jagger said “You can’t always get what you want”
It sweetens the cliché.
i'm on a diet, what's your excuse?
Maybe tonight there'll  be pie in the sky, and tomorrow a helicopter will come!
Too bad I gave up candy for Lent.
I told you it was an unusual destination and you needed to use spellcheck!
Can you believe those idiots wanted to be rescued?
All corn syrup and glutens.  Forget about it.
Yep; sea levels rose, and now it’s the Small Rock Candy Island.
I never thought Candyland was a real place. The worst that could happen is we slide back to here.
Like the land of milk and honey, but better.
It's the docking pier for The Good Ship Lollypop!
It's OK.  You'll get to like coconut
It’s day ten of my no-sugar diet.
And you really are a dentist?
I didn't know you wanted to be on a dessert island with me!
You go ahead. Wilson says I need to cut back on refined sugar.
More bad luck for a pair of  diabetics.
Tasty mirage.
But I'm still hungry.
I was hoping for,  you know,  milk and honey but this is OK too
I told you it was spelled with two esses.
I have a great name for it, but we'll have to pay a royalty to Hasbro.
Doesn’t bother me. Not atoll.
The genie messed up slightly.
The Dental Association will stop at nothing!
Forget it, man: you’ll get fat... and there’s not a dentist in sight.
Consider yourself lucky, almost no one escapes Neverland.
You swim over and see. If it's real bring me back something gluten free.
These Disney theme parks are popping up just about everywhere
The good ship Lollipop would've stopped here, but no, you
have to cut back on glutton.
Here comes that damn yellow submarine again
Yeah, but we need to brush and floss afterwards.
I have diabetes. You can't swim.  That desserted island is a no-go.
I haven't seen any sharks today.
I keep hoping I will wake up and find out this is just a nightmare about commonly confused expressions.
At least we're not obese
Well, grass is always pinker on the other side of the mirage.
Just my luck. I've given up sugar and gluten.
I wonder if they need fresh cocunuts?
Your fantasies are working overtime, dear.
I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be in the shade.
The sugar high is just a mirage.
If the current does't get you your diabetes will!
Just des(s)ert?
I counted 50 shark fins out there. Let’s give it a shot.
Tell me again why we had to select the gluten-free option?
Dammit. I just started a cleanse this week.
It appeared this morning. Mirage or metaphor. I'm not sure. Don't forget, neither of us can swim.
Typo probably. We're deserted, one 's'.
Before you go, remember, we'll always have "the tree."
I know you don’t have a toothbrush, but maybe just this one time!
I'd swim there, but I can't afford the calories.
The SS Cannibis wrecked there
You go.  I'm off sugar and gluten.
I’ll draw off the gummy sharks, and you make a break for it.
Are you getting the munchies?
and they told me swimming would help me lose weight
It's where the Good Ship Lollypop docks.
Do you mind if I eat the doughnut?
Sex is always better than sugar!
I call it  dess-ert island.
How did we get the "desert" island?
Sure, go ahead. But I'm pretty sure the next island won't have insulin shots for your diabetes.
Just our luck to get stuck in the Molasses Swamp just before we made it to the Candy Castle.
The island is always sweeter on the other side of the water.
The Great Pacific Diet Patch is always so big this time of year.
Only if it's gluten-free.
So who would you choose to spend your life with on a dessert island?
And you're sure the sharks didn't put it there?
I really don't care for theme parks.
I knew changes were going to come after that "Good Ship Lollipop" hit that reef.
I know, I know, it's probably just a mirage, but should we swim over anyway to see if anything is gluten-free?
I don’t know, I’d really hate to get my hair wet.
I would like to know the catch!
What if they want us too?
Let your conscience be your guide.
I think I'm having my mom's nightmare.
Winters, we do the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
This is nice, but I’d rather be stuck on a desserted island.
Hansel, I believe we have been trapped in a cartoon cliche.
They breathe through the candy canes.  If you get close, the cake eats you.
The good ship "lollypop" frequently sails these waters.
Do you miss it?
I told you to use spellcheck when you answered the "stranded on an island" question!
The grass always looks greener over there
Sure, but we have a more context-sensitive design sense.
I'm pretty sure they're also antennae.
For a mirage, it's pretty generic.
I've got to say, we took refudge on the wrong island.
I think we should stay with the palm oil here rather than risk that unhealthy pure cane sugar.
Honey -- I think we chose the wrong fantasy island.
Under the circumstances I'll settle for a 'sugar high.'
I’m vegan so no, but go if you want
This way, you won't be tempted.
You know, if global warming is real, that dessert island won't be here in 10 years.
Robinson let himself go lately.
Leave it for the sharks, let them rot their teeth.
I'm on keto but don't hold back on my account.
Somehow I thought your wish for “civilisation” would turn out different.
It’ll go right to your hips!
You eat that crap?
You'd think being stranded on an island would be the perfect opportunity to cut down on processed sugars...
I heard a witch is stranded there.
Of course it looks good, but it's all empty calories.
I told you it was two Ss!
Was supposed to be your surprise birthday party... I might have messed up with the address
I dreamed of a “Sweet Thing” joining us...and this is what we got.
Hey Chip, why are we stranded on the deserted island rather than the dessert island?
Did you hear any news recently about the Good Ship Lollypop going down in our area?
It’s only fair that we get our just deserts.
Remind me again, which stage of Hansel and Gretel Syndrome are we in?
So you're saying it's just a matter of perspective?
It's ok, I'm not hungry.
It's too bad I can't swim, and you are totally low-carb.
I feel like this is the sequel of FYRE FESTIVAL!
Welcome, to Paleo Island.
Do you think there's a sweeter life out there?
It just makes my teeth ache we look at it.
Big Rock Candy Mountain my ass
At least we didn't wind up on THAT island. Sugar is so bad for you.
Dessert island is looking pretty good right about now
It must be a figment of your imagination. Why don't you lie down and take a nap. Meanwhile, I think I'm going to go swimming.
We got stranded on the wrong island.
It isn't a mirage, it's an île flottante
That old witch from Hansel and Gretal never gives up, does she.
I told you there were two s's!
Of course it appears right when I’m on a diet!
I said 'dessert' island you schmuck. What are we meant to do here?
Well, I’ll be. I always thought that dessert islands were a fiction of New Yorker cartoons.
Can we swim on an empty stomach?
It's still not Candy Land.
They're on the Island of Misfit Carbs.
Dang, that island looks sweet!
'Probably cannibals.'
Ok, so far so good, now we wait...
The real mistake was using spellcheck.
Thank god I am more of a salty rather than a sweets person.
And here I thought I could finally make my diet work.
I guess that’s the legendary en-suite dessert island
I'm diabetic. And you?
Unless Captain Crunch pops out, I’m not interested.
I wish we hadn't started that diet.
Yeah, but they don't have any coconuts!
Still have doubts about evolution?
You know deserted is spelled with only one s, right?
Heck of a time to be on a low-carb diet.
Looks like the boss remembered your birthday.
...but we don't have any shoots or ladders.
I wished for Scrabble!
I would, but I'm dieting.
It's even worse than you think. I'm on the keto diet.
If we swim over there we'll still be lost, plus we'll have acne.
Don't look, it's their fake news.
I'd prefer that Desserted Island over ours.
So, I see another Swiss family has moved into the hood.
It's not a mirage. My mirage would be gluten-free.
Yes, I can swim.  But I'm pretty sure those aren't gluten free.
Bradley, I just had an incredible idea for a children's board game - or my name's not Milton.
This is so much better that being near the Isle of Man.
Seriously?  You wished for Candy Cane Island?
Of all the weeks to start Atkins...
I don't think so. I've been trying to lose weight.
I'd swim over but I've maxed out my dental plan.
Man, as if being a diabetic isn’t bad enough...
It's supposed to be another desert island. The cartoonist put in an extra "s" on that one.
I can hear the sirens calling from here.
I told my mom I'm not into sweets, but she insisted I was getting too skinny out here.
It’s a port of call for the Good Ship Lollipop.
You think I'll be okay? I left my insulin on the plane.
Well, that sure strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy.
If you had to pick one person to be stranded with on a dessert island, who would it be?
All yours. I’m more of a savoury guy.
Sure wish I knew how to swim.
It's tempting but we don't have a dental plan.
I don't know.  I'm trying to stay away from carbs.
I can see the headlines at home: Lost at Sea -- The Good Ship Lollipop ....
They say that no one ever comes in, and no one ever comes out.
I don’t know about you...but this is not what I meant by “how sweet it would be to see land”!
Im telling you if there is a witch we would have seen her
It's Willie Wonka's private island.
Seriously, Honey, I didn't say 'desert' island to the genie.
Candy is dandy but sex won't rot your teeth.
A dessert-ed island!
On the bright side, I've been trying to stay away from carbs.
Our island is gluten-free.
Go ahead, I'm on a diet.
Mirage or not, the glycemic numbers have to be off the charts.
If you draw a pink card, you go directly to Candyland.
If you draw a blue card, you'll be swimming with the sharks.
Thank God we're on the keto island.
I'm hoping it's a stop for Disney Cruises.
I thought we could finally diet in peace over here.
Evidently, the Candyman couldn't.
Without a freshness date, I just can't.
Now this is a National Emergency!
But did you actually see the sharks making it?
Looks unhealthy
So, Gretel, now we know where tropical witches live.
Too bad our politicians don't believe in Global Sweetening.
Sometimes I wonder whether we should have chosen the dessert island instead.
You did agree that the palm tree was a nice touch
I'm just trying to stay away from carbs.
Did you pack the dental floss?
Either we're meant to eat it or its meant to eat us.
Just the tip of the iceberg, Jack.
Your going to desert me for a sleazy dessert.
Tell me once again what we were doing when the Good Ship Lollipop sank.
Damn, the tsunami got the Big Rock Candy Mountain!
I Was better at Chutes and Ladders"
Too bad neither of us can swim.
You know I'm not doing carbs, right?
Cavity Island?
It’s not worth it, they’re probably loaded with corn syrup.
Deserted island? More like-"
"WE GET IT, STEVE!
I told you the word had an extra s in it, didn’t I?
What do we have to lose?
Every day it's a different flying saucer...
I heard the sharks in this area are highly intelligent predators.
It doesn't look gluten free.
I'd be tempted only if there's also an island nearby with a giant insulin syringe.
It's on the map, Diabetes Island.
Really, I just can't risk it; I finally have my diabetes under control.
On second thought, I'll start my diet tomorrow.
JUST WHEN IM FINALLY ABLE TO FIT INTO MY LEVIS....
What makes you think it's a spaceship?
Do you have your credit card on you?
I tell you, it’s spelled with one s, not two.
It's a mirage. And there's only one "s" in desert.
That coconut milk was tasty, wasn't it?
Yeh, I’m also doing sugar free January..
It's true! The Garden of Eden is actually Cane enabled!
I would try to swim to it but I'm diabetic.
Sand is always sweeter on the other side.
Big Rock Candy...Island?
I think I might have left out an s.
I picked the wrong week to be off sugar.
Dude, that stuff will kill you.
I'd swim over there if you were a dentist.
*Insert Dessert Island Pun*
I knew we should’ve used a travel agent
You go ahead, I'm committed to my Ketogenic diet.
I think it's the Disney submarine.
I'm thinking major GMOs, herbicides, and pesticides. We're good.
'Swim left,' you said
I'm pretty sure it's the sharks.
That must be Diabetes Island.  I noticed it on the map.
So Shirley Temple lied?
Dude, there’s no way that’s not a mirage.
The Oompa Loompas are quiet today
Do you see it too?
Strange. I see brunch
Well, at least we’ll stay fit and trim.
I don’t care if we drown swimming back to the shade.
I guess we should've taken the Goodship Lollipop.
Calorie Island is very nice this time of year.
Calorie Island" is a tempting place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there
It is not what it looks like.
Remember that scene in 'Papillon' where Steve McQueen eats a doughnut?
It's a Fake Mirage.
I wish I knew how to swim.
We can't swim over there! I don't have my toothbrush.
“Its either a mirage or we found the final resting place of the good ship Lollipop”
Think how lucky we are that coconut is gluten-free.
I know you're hungry, Bob, but I'm your dietician, and I insist we stay put.
We re going to die, but have slightly more shade.
My doctor said take a relaxing vacation and avoid sugar.
I'm giving Paleo one more week and then I'm going over
I wonder if the owners of that abandoned amusement park still think global warming's not real.
Simple sugars?! It looks pretty complex to me.
Too bad I’m on a sugar-free diet.
Global warming has certainly had its effect on the North Pole.
And to think that back in the States, they think this is just a raft of plastic straws.
Dang sharks are at it again!
The witch from Hansel & Gretel has really upped her game.
Do we really need the empty calories?
Think they're gluten free?
20 minutes on the keto diet and i'm hallucinating
No, I didn’t pack a spare toothbrush.
If I weren't watching my weight . . .
Sure, we could swim it, but I worry about the health consequences of more refined sugar in my diet.
Sharks or sugars... who knows
You can't have your cake island and eat it, too.
It's not a mirage. There's cheesecake.
Well, the second Fyre Festival looks promising.
They call it the 'Plane Crash Diet.'
We haven’t had water for days, Will. It’s not what you think. Trust me on this one.
My favorite mirage!
So this is how we will work on delayed gratification issues?
The grass is always greener, Phil.
Too bad you lost your insulin in the crash
Sure, it looks good, but it's just not worth the calories.
In the islands, Christmas comes early.
Our coconuts are more nutricious.
The grass always looks greener on the other island.
Cupcakes and candy canes are the best  hallucinations!
At least we don't have to imagine what it looks like.
Is it still important that we watch our weight?
You go ahead, I don’t have my insulin.”
Do you want to reconsider our Keto pledge?
Think any of it is Gluten Free?
What did I tell you Diane? The perfect solution to our utter lack of self control.
Technically it's an unlimited buffet but we really should have read the fine print."
I said stop with the 'good ship lollipop' wisecracks but would you listen?
If only we had some whipped cream.
And one, and two, and three:  "On the good ship lollypop......."
I wanted to be stranded alone on a dessert Isle, but I never get what I wish for.
What's a mirage?
I would volunteer, but I’m trying to lose a few pounds.
Ever hear of that fish which dangles a bait over it's mouth?
Now if we only had the Good Ship Lollipop....
I thought Candy Land was just a game
Can't wait for cheat day!
Sweet, isn’t it ?
Let's wait for cheat day.
With our luck, it's sugar-free!
From just our desert to our just dessert  -- now we're talkin'
Tune in next week for the finale of "The Biggest Loser in... Paradise?"
This is the third hallucination you have had in a week.
That's good, but I was hoping for some of the great humor these situations are famous for.
Well yeah, but the elementary school is only a 4.
One wish, and you had to leave out the "s."
Aw shucks, missed it by one S
I hear they use artificial sweeteners.
Our ship's name was the Lollipop, why?
I’d rather be desserted.
On Monday morning it seemed like a good idea to cut out all sugar and carbs, by Monday afternoon life no longer seemed worth living.
We would have to go off of the Keto diet.
I dunno, man, I'm trying to watch my carbs.
Not me. Too much gluten.
I'm more ambivalent about sea level rise than I once was.
this is nothing compared to the eruption
I call it "Island Pt. 2," but, sure, "Candy Island" sounds good too.
They all died from obesity-related diseases.
You think they're gluten-free?
I had hoped this would be an opportunity to drop a few pounds.
Guess I picked the wrong week to lay off the carbs.
I've never been much for sweets.
I don't know ... Fyre was pretty bad too.
Only you would wish for the Good Ship Lollipop!
I really picked the wrong month to go Paleo."
You can go but I'm staying on this Keto diet.
If we swim both ways,we burn more calories.
Want to jump the shark?
I'd swim over, but my dentist said no sweets.
I don’t know ... it was just there when I woke up.
If you’re worried about spoiling our appetites, I feel like we won’t be having dinner for a while.
We should have booked the Good Ship Lollipop.
No. I'm on a paleo diet.
That will kill you faster then this.
And just abandon my New Year’s resolution? Please - that’s such a cliche.
God, I miss gluten!
It’s just a mirage, one of the unanticipated symptoms of ketosis.
It makes our coconut water suck, doesn’t it?
And here we are with our darn Diabetes."
I've always wondered what it was like to live the sweet life.
Why would Thiebaud have an installation way out here?
It's just as well.  I've been watching my sugars.
True. We both have diabetes and neither of us is a strong swimmer, but still...
I'll stay here; I'm on a diet
Legend has it that's the island where the cruise ship's dessert chef washed up.
I bet it's all coconut flavored.
It's not the sharks it's the gluten.
First you look like a cheeseburger to me,and now THIS!
I would have booked a desserted island if I had known it would be so deserted.
If only we had a gingerbread boat ...
Do you think it's a mirage?
Is that a mirage or are we playing candy land?
Some genies aren't certified.
Remember how huge The Big Rock Candy Mountain seemed to us when we were kids?
Yeah, but those candy canes don't look like they cast much shade.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
It get's better, they're building a wall.
Doesn't that grass looker greener?
Is this what it feels like to be on Keto?
I picked a bad month to go on a diet
It just suddenly occurred to me that getting stuck here is just desserts for us criminals.
I can't believe we gave up sweets for lent.
That extra "S" really makes a difference.
Keto this, keto that. If it’s so great, that Island would be covered in cauliflower and unsalted nuts. Well, it’s not.
Like, none of that stuff is Paleo!
You should see it when the sugarplum fairies are on spring break!
Well, at least the grass isn't greener on the other side.
It's out of our points!
Well, no offense, but being alone on a desserted island doesn't look so bad after all.
Very tempting yes. But all I can think about is Hansel and Gretel.
Looks like the Good Ship Lollipop made a happy landing.
Just don’t get roped into the talk, that there is one pricey timeshare.
Gotta hand it to you, this is one helluva view.
You know, I think things are better on the other side.
​I’ve been so disgusted with myself since the holidays; I really shouldn’t.
Fyre Festival delivery snafu. Hungry?
It’s tempting now, but after 10 days on the coconut-water cleanse you’ll see that dessert island for what it really is ... cavities, diabetes and sand.
It's obvious that you do not know the difference between dessert and desert!
I can't even look at refined sugar without it going straight to my waistline
You go ahead. I didn't bring my fat pants.
...and then he pulled us out of The Paris Agreement...
Its actually a submerged part of the Big Rock Candy Mountain chain.
Sure, but our grass is greener.
Oh, double “s”?
It sucks to have a gluten allergy.
I’ll bet none of it is gluten free.
Do you think it’s sugar free?
To avoid the same mistake choosing in the future, remember the double-S means you want more.
This is my 27th deserted island gig... you'd think these cartoons would get better than this...
Remember, we have to wait ninety minutes before we swim to our next meal
I heard it was surrounded by diabetic sharks
It's disconcerting how quickly that ambush predator adapted to our presence.
Seriously, this may be the moment to forget about that allergy.
You go ahead.  No way I'm eating dessert before supper.
Drat, I didn't save room for dessert!
No chocolate?...I think I’ll pass.
Do they have mirages in the ocean?
Ever since I started this fast I just don't even want sugar anymore.
Thank Heavens I’m on a low carb diet.
In know it's a mirage but I'm going to swim for it anyway.
You think it’s real?
This must mean the Good Ship Lollipop will be here soon.
‘Lately I’ve begun to reconsider my hardline stance on selling out.’
Now I understand why our friends find your veganism insufferable
Now that we’ve finished off Broccoli Island, whaddya say we go polish off Candy Cane Island?
You're just dehydrated.
Dang...why couldn't we have ended up on a "dessert" island?
If my wife finds out, she'll kill me
I said two 'S's, Randy, now we're stuck on the desert isle.
I wonder if Katy Perry is over there
We must first eat our vegetables.
If only we had "Chutes and Ladders".
It's a totally dessertic island.
If you have to swim off the calories, they don't taste as good
Good thing we both went Paleo.
The grass is always greener when it's made of mint frosting.
I'm waiting for a Groupon deal.
...and all we got was mushrooms.
What happened to the cigarette trees?
Not sure why you thought THIS was the best island to open a dental office.
I would, but I gave up sweets for lent!
I’m not saying you don’t have nice buns, I’m just saying that the ones over there look gorgeous.
Why did we have to sign up for the low-carb cruise?
It's just as well. I'm avoiding carbs.
You see desserts. They're deli sandwiches to me. 
Let's just agree to disagree.
Maybe I'll start eating carbs again.
As I don't have any teeth left - I say let's go for it!
It's not a mirage -- mirages can only happen in a desert
It’s a type of mirage known as “Fata Morgana,” and it triggers an irresistible urge to play board games.
Man, I should have paid better attention in spelling class
Oh, look! It's the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
with lemonade springs
and the bluebird sings ... 
It's the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Can you even imagine being out here and needing a dentist?
Sspelling countss.
You decide, which is worse, swimming with sharks or tooth decay.
Wish we didn’t start Weight Watchers yesterday.
It was called the good ship
Loppypop   But it went off course
Which one has the double 'S' again?
It's just a mirage ... Trump Island ain't that sweet!
I know it looks tempting, but I once saw a headline that read: Sugar Kills!
Well, I'm sick of coconuts too but think of the tooth decay!
I love you, sugar.
Would you rather be on that dessert-ed island?
I was my junior high spelling champion,” you said. “I say there’s only one s in dessert,” you said.
and they all died from obesity
No. I'm keto
Best not, I think our cannibal neighbor just set another trap.
No kidding! I’m on the paleo diet too.
The real issue is the 90% of it you don't see.
I told them my favorite dessert was coconut Mounds.
What a lousy time to be diabetic.
Yeah, but can you imagine the view from there?
I think we are not on our sweet spot
No Bob, I have not forgotten how you feel about puns.”
I say we go today. There could be a wall around it tomorrow.
Want to play Candyland?
It was a new bakery that, tragically, last Christmas, forgot the maxim "location, location, location."
I don't know if it's worth it, I'm more a savoury type of guy."
OK, today I get to crack wise about being marooned on a DESSERT island. Your turn to look out for the Good Ship Lollipop.
The sprinkles are always sweeter on the other side.
Fake News?
To be honest,I would have wished for a Russ & Daughters
Candy, candy everywhere, and not a piece to eat!
You go ahead. I'm trying to cut back on sugar.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, I AM ON A NO SUGER DIET.
Is it my imagination, or do you also see a steak and lobster dinner?
I would, but I'm on a no-swim diet.
This is my third time at Fyre Fest.
Damn my computer spell check.  I know I typed "dessert island"  on the Expedia website.
yeah, but I don't do gluten
sweetie,you remembered
I guess we've got dessert covered.
Now we just need some fish for our entree.
We still need fresh water, though.
It’s for the best, diabetes is a killer.
Looks much sweeter over there.
Like Voltaire said, "Illusion is the first of all pleasures"
I would swim over, but before I do, are you seeing what I'm seeing, or am I just hallucinating.
I'm not that worried about the piranhas, but my cholesterol would go through the roof.
I told you that coconut had gone bad...
It’s okay, you go. I can’t do carbs.
It would be worth the swim if I wasn't trying to watch my figure.
You go ahead, I'm gluten free.
We really picked the wrong time to start the keto diet, didn't we?
Sure it's tempting ... until high tide.
You have to learn to see past the spam to the deeper hallucinations.
They're out of salt water taffy until low tide!
They survived the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop!
I'm starting to regret taking the gluten-free option.
Nah, you go ahead. I'm strictly paleo.
You think Uber Eats delivers out here...?
Go for it, man. I'm on a low-carb diet.
Nice.  Let’s do the women’s beach volleyball one again.
It may look like the Good Ship Lollipop to you, but it looks like one helluva huge angler fish to me!
I call dibs on the strawberry. Your turn.
No, thanks. I’ll stay here. I can’t eat sweets on an empty stomach.
Relax. The "Good Ship Lollipop" ferry should be arriving at any minute.
Sure, but once you finish with desssert, you’re left on a desert island with no shade.  Just look at our beautiful palm tree.
If you think its hat is in poor taste, wait until you can see its handbag.
I still think we made the right choice enrolling on Diet Island.
Lovely antennas on that one!
I really wish that genie hadn't been such a stickler for spelling.
Think the sharks are gone?
We are so lucky to have such a great view of the mirage!
But I thought I said dessert island.
I wonder if those cupcakes are gluten-free.
Yeah, I know how to swim but I'm on a diet
I heard that's where the good ship Lolipop washed ashore.
Yeah, they’re baked fresh everyday.
Think there's a milk island out there somewhere?
Sometimes things are just sweeter on the other side
The calories we’d burn avoiding the sharks would make the desserts worthwhile.
Finally, it's cheat day!
I won't tell my nutritionist if you don't.
The witch said it was okay to swim over there, Hansel.
I really feel so much better after our annual sugar detox vacay.
Do you think it’s sugarless?
So sweet! I’ve never seen someone sugarcoat a situation so well...
I just keep thinking, "I could have grabbed my toothbrush".
Listen Bob, I understand that YOU can’t swim, but this suicide pact seems a little unfair
Yes, I like coconuts, but that desserted island just looks better...
That's amore!
Gluten, fats, sugar. I'll stick with the coconut thanks.
Enough, desert, one 's' or two, homonym, homophone, homograph...can't we discuss something more important?
I am getting sick of that commercial.
Just like all small communities, the building department hasn't given final approvals for a full set of Arches
For the hundredth time, Forrest, ours is the one with one 's.'
I said dessert island, not desert island.
Dude, you forgot the second S
Damn the luck. I’m on a low carb diet.
Ignore it Tom,this is what the 'Brexit' campaign promised and look where we ended up!
What are the odds they’re gluten free.
I would, but I’m on the desert island cleanse.
The Good Ship Lollipop crew couldn't swim.
All yours - I’m going carb-free this month.
Did you think Shirley Temple simply made it all up?
Bali Hai no, Sugar High yes!
Crappy time to be on a Paleo diet, eh?
Dude, have you ever played Candyland?
Well we finished the first 3 courses on this side, how do we get across to the dessert tray?
Too bad the Good Ship Lollypop didn't stop on our island.
Fred, the singular thing that has kept my sanity is that one day this tree will bear fruit and then the cake people will be jealous.
That is Baits Island.
I've thought about it, too, but I'm on the paleo diet.
Yeah, I don’t like sweets either.
Back in civilization we would say “ no” to all those carbs, but here, there’s no one to judge us.
Do you also regret not learning to swim?
At least we've been able to keep Disney from buying this island!
My doctors told me to avoid sugar.
They call it the Island of Misfit Desserts.
Forget it.  You’ll ruin your appetite
How do they do it? That's the third time this week it's floated past us.
Sorry, I have a strict rule. No candy canes until the day after Thanksgiving.
Just your luck, the Good  Shop Lollipop dropped us on 
the wrong island.
This gives new meaning to being stranded on a deserted island!
You go for it . I’m on Atkins.
You go. I'm trying to cut back on sugar.
It's tempting, but I am on a low carb diet.
Come on, Hansel. You can swim that far.
diabetes island fucking blows
Nobody’s going. No toothpaste.
Let's head on over, and don't say it will just make us fat
Do you think it's an hallucination?
We chose the salad first.
What do you suggest we wash it down with?
Well, at least we have each other
I guess Mom was right about signing up for swimming lessons back in the day.
Let's stowaway on the Good Ship Lollipop, you said.
The mirages keep getting better and better.
Is that the Fyre Festival?
I really just want another coconut.
You can't escape it - there's sugar in very thing!
Could this be a dirty trick by the sharks
It's a shame I gave up sweets.
We have to lay off the fermented coconut milk!
Thanks but I’m having a colonoscopy tomorrow
GrubHub promised delivery an hour ago.
I don't want to be ungrateful and I'm glad we're finally safe BUT to think we missed Candyland by just one island!
It's a trick.  The closest dentist is five islands away.
Actually I'm diabetic.
Are the rules the same as they are in Candyland?
So what’s for dessert?
My bad, I forgot the second "S"  in dessert.
It's amazing how auto-correct can really ruin your vacation..."_or_"Honey, I thought you said we were going to vacation on the desserted island."_or_"Wow honey, that island right over there really puts the extra 's' in desserted island.
Dessert island might be a nice change from desert island.
Best left alone as a mirage, I say.
Yeah, it's too bad we gave up carbs.
It's the first stop for the Good Ship Lollipop.
You go. My doctor told me to lay off sweets.
But more importantly, where has the rum gone?
Damn. I never could get the correct spelling right.
I wish I hadn't sworn off processed foods.
The app says that it's arriving now.
It looks inviting, but not much shade under a candy cane.
Do you want to go over there?" "No, I heard the cookies have raisins.
I'm not sure...I read somewhere that angler fish are getting more creative.
Did it say "dessert" island?
Don't fall for it. All that sugar isn't good for you.
At least we don’t have to worry about dessert...
The captain dumped us, but he's sending us Christmas treats.
It's probably just a mirage."
It's nice but for first class only!
I told the travel agent it was spelled with two S’s.
Candy Land is less magical in real life.
Just our luck we’re hypoglycemic
‘what do you think the chances are of one of those being gluten free?’
Let me guess, Candy Land, again
It's a mirage or they're smarter than we think!
It's a mirage. They're not really gluten-free.
Giving up sugar and gluten is turning out to be a bad decision.
There goes another Candyland Cruise, next will be the Chutes and Ladders one.
I'm rethinking my real estate purchase on Paleo Island.
Looks like the good ship lollipop has been there.
Don't worry, the water is treated with fluoride.
But then what would we have to look it?
Before we swim there, let's flip a coin, heads it's real, tails it's a mirage.
It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle change.
Some moron must have designed the spellcheck feature on your GPS.
The fabled Cocoamo, that's where we want to go.
Go ahead, please! I'm trying to cut back on mirages.
Yeah, it really was a bad time to start that 30-day no sugar diet.
True,"the big rock candy mountain" never mentioned "no global warming".
We are better off on the carb free island.
Sure we could go there, but it is all carbs.
Don't even try. We're on the desert isle trope, so that has to be a mirage trope.
Trust me, we'll live longer on this Keto Island.
That one extra "s" really makes such a difference.
and I thought we had the sweet life
I'm holding out for the good ship lollipop.
Genies. They'll get ya every time.
I prefer our high fiber diet.
Diet be damned!
No, I can't. Gotta fit into my tux this weekend.
That's the Good Ship Lollipop's port of call.
It'll just ruin your teeth.
I warned you one more candy gram and you’re off the island
I would... but I'm doing low carbs.
If it *really* is a mirage, then why has the frosting started to melt?
This is the pay off climate change skeptics promised!
Yesterday it was a Big Mac supersized meal.
I know it looks good, but it will go straight to your hips.
It might be a giant octopus who thought we'd said 'macarooned on a dessert island.'
Before global warming it was a mountain top.
You just had to book the gluten-free one.
This was the wrong week to give up sugar.
Forget it. You're on a diet.
Candy cane? I say candy can't.
It looks good now, but all of that will go straight to your thighs.
This is how I stick to a low carb diet.
This is the last time we sail on the Good Ship Lollipop.
You insisted we go to the all-natural island.
Too bad our health insurance doesn't cover dental.
Any more insulin shots left?
Sure, Candyland® would be nice, but I'd rather see a Battleship® over there.
I don't do sugar
That one was settled by the Good Ship Lollipop!
Well, at least we won't get fat.
Now the president is bound to find us.
I call "dibs."
You go ahead, I’m on a diet this week
Ok, we’ll go but if it’s a mirage again can we just focus on the signal fire?
When our ship comes in, you think they'd let us off there?
Fortunately I'm on a low carb diet
We're in trouble. There goes the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
If you ever get another chance, be specific that the wish is about this island.
What diet?
I'd swim over there with you, but it's almost bikini season...
I can hear Burl Ives singing The Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Are you absolutely sure you're still diabetic?
Damn, I picked the wrong island.
We could try sending our message in a strudel.
I dunno, I always thought of it as a mountain.
Definitely one of my favorite mirages.
Think of all the carbs you will burn swimming there.
It must be real. If it was a dream, then that would be a *jelly* donut!
I’m positive I left the bread crumbs leading to it, but the tide must have come in.
Trust me, nothing's worse than eating empty calories.
Life is full of temptations!
I'm holding out for peaches and cream.
I'm wondering if that might be the "Good Ship Lollypop?"
It sure looks nice, but you know, the grass is always greener...
Is it gluten-free?
You can get home delivery for online orders
They do look tempting, but what about the five second rule?
Yeah, but it has no shade and we might get a sugar burn.
They're from "The Bad Ship Lollipop."
I was wondering why the flight was so empty. I hate spellcheck.
Do you think the cupcake is a trap?
If you squint, doesn’t that island kinda look like a spaceship?
Who says life is fair, where is that written?
That’s Temptation Island. I went for something more tropical.
Jokes on them. This one isn't deserted either.
If we only had a raft that would be so sweet!
Sorry,​ wrong choice of words.
I told you another S can make all the difference.
Any chance they're sugar and gluten-free?
I’m looking forward to our cheat meal.
You know, I'm full.  Do you want desert?
You take it.  I'm on the coconut water diet.
Have I entered the other side, or do you see it too?
What do you think?  Gluten free?
How about winner takes all?
Ahoy Matey! Well, maybe it's the good submarine Lollipop
You're sure about this paleo diet?
I don’t won’t the spoil my dinner of salt water and hope.
Thus the phrase,jumping the shark.
But I haven't had dinner yet
I go off the diet now, I'll never get to my target weight.
It’s too bad you’re on that no sugar diet.
Dude, there are two esses in "dessert". Never rely on spellcheck.
Even if there aren’t any sharks it would be really unhealthy.”
No, I'm good. I'm trying to watch my carbs.
Just an Ile Flotante... It'll pass
Global warming at the North Pole...
We should have brought some money.
It's your mirage - you tell ME if they're gluten-free
You can't be over 20 on Sugar Mountain
I don't know for sure, but I'm gonna guess we're somewhere near the Calory Islands
``Please, just for me. Let me hear it one more time. `All islands are a like.' Did I get that right, Magellan?''
I would go but I am on that paleo diet.
Yea, but swimming back
would be even harder.
Thank goodness, there aren't any Oreos or I'd chance the swim.
So, I know we both SWORE off gluten for New Years, I know that, but I feel like an exception can be made, right?
Huh, so that’s what they meant by Desseted Island.
Keto-schmeto .. I say we swim for it !
The main course must be around here somewhere.
I like your Candy Land mirage, but its kind of useless without  Shoots and Ladders.
Looks like the Good Ship lost it’s cargo.
Finally, the good ship lollipop.
The island always looks sweeter on the other side of the lagoon.
Careful, Jarvis.  These krakens are diabolically cunning.
We seemed to have skipped the Entree, Surf & Turf mirage.
If you were on on a desserted island what would you wish for?
This reminds me of a funny autocorrect story.
No reason why we both need to stay on the Paleo Diet.
The Island is sweeter on the other side!
Spend enough time on a desert island, and you begin to start hallucinating another ‘s’
I see a couple of sweet gals,with candy cane tops and a delicious bottom.
I bet it's all gluten-free.
You know, I've heard just about every version of "The Big Rock Candy Mountain", and none of them mentions climate change.
if only we had some milk
I would swim over, but I just ate lunch.
Soooo . . . Where ya wanna go?
Have you reached ketosis yet?
You go. I’m on a low-carb diet.
That's what you get for booking through a discount site
I think I’ve entered the hallucination phase of the Whole 30.
Do you think the island has gluten-free options?
You go ahead, I'm cutting back on sugar this month.
If you could only bring one board game to a dinner party, what would it be?
Did you ever read the story about Hansel and Gretel?
Not South Beach.
I think we picked the wrong things to give up for Lent.
Maybe for you, but personally, since we’ve been here, I’ve been sugar, caffeine, gluten, lactose free and have never been thinner
Stop singing “ Big Rock Candy Mountain” it’s an ISLAND!”
Did you order the "Trip Insurance"?
Look, that's the mysterious island of diabetes...
I'm sticking to my New Year's Resolution.
That’s Fyre Island. Instagram models will be there too.
No way, not with my blood glucose levels!
I don’t care if it’s a mirage, I’m swimming for it.
They are castaways from the good ship "Lollipop."
Want to go get baked?
I definitely prefer the dessert view to the garden view!
I think the hunger is really getting to me.
I heard the inhabitants are signing an anti-immigration law.
Dessert Island is probably overrated anyway, Steve.
Is that the platform for the 2020 Democratic candidates ?
Mom says we can swim over after we eat all our vegetables.
None of it is Paleo, bro.
Sure it looks good, Harry, but do you really want an increased risk of heart disease?
It's not a mirage.  It's Nelly, the Lock Ness monster in her Mardi Gras gear.
Darling! You remembered my birthday!
There's no wall. Let's swim for it.
On the bright side, I’m on a low carb diet.
I don't think I'll stay for the fireworks.
You go ahead, I’d rather be bikini ready in a few days.
They just opened a new Starbucks
I know that desserted island looks tempting, but the gummy bears will kill you.
Naw, man.  Way too many carbs.
Alright dang it! You can have the candy cane with more stripes. But I get BOTH the cupcakes!
The shuttle runs how often?
It's just your serotonin talking... lick me. You'll get over it.
And to think I gave up sweets for Lent!
Nah, I’m trying to stay gluten free.
I hear they got $3B in tax breaks to build it there.
Location, location: we're sitting on a dental tourism gold mine!
The sharks are betting we'll risk it.

Patricia Halbert
South Salem, New York
No. It's called an empty calories isle.
I finally reached ketosis, and now this.
Would you rather dive for Danish or bob for babka?
I wonder if they have anything that's gluten free?
Someday the oceans will be filled with the their plastic wrappings.
Trumpland.
It's nice to have dreams...
The network didn't approve my idea for a  kid's version of Survivor but maybe we could use it for something else.
Looks like the big rock candy mountain is really an island
Dude, you gotta leave those empty carbs and refined sugar to some other castaways.
But is it vegan?
So that's the proverbial Candy Land
Looks like I picked the wrong week to start the Keto Diet
Your father easily made the swim.  Diabetes took him.
I told you you should've packed your insulin in case we got deserted.
No thanks, I’m on a diet.
I will wait for the coconut, it has natural sugar.
Now...aren´t you glad you got away from all that?
I must confess, being on Paleo is taking some of the sting out of this....
I would but I am trying out the paleo diet.
I just started a juice cleanse, too
I swore I put in Candy Land into Google Maps.
Just as well, dear. None of those things are on your diet.
Glad we escaped from diabetes island
Well the good news is it's bad for your teeth.
Wow! ... That extra “s” isn’t a typo!
Diabetes seems worth risking right about now.
I guess we will just have to wait for the Good Ship Lollipop to refuel.
I told you when we crashed here that if we found a palm tree and grew beards we’d be making jokes in no time. See? A “desserted” island! Get it?
Are you nuts?  That strawberry is not even organic.
Now I know how it feels to be on the other side of the wall.
I don't think so, I'm on a diet.
This is best hallucination I've had since listening to the President's SOTU speeches.
Let’s ask them for the full menu.
We could sure use those kinds of preservatives.
The only thing it’s missing is sunshine and lollipops.
Yeah. Or it could be just a bloated whale carcass.
It's such a 20th century mirage, don't you think?
We're lucky, that's all that's left of the wreck of the Good Ship Lollypop.
You know that stuff isn't good for you.
Now we wait for the good ship Lollipop to sail by . . .
I'd rather swim to Savory Island.
You should go,I'm on this paleo diet right now.
Too bad we're diabetic.
Carbs
We should've clarified to the genie that we wanted to be on a "desSert island"!
And to think I used to make fun of Grammar Nazis.
I say we wait until the holidays
The sharks made it all last night.
Too bad, I've sworn off sugar!
Funny thing, but last time I was stranded--in that avalanche?--it was Big Rock Candy mountain.
I think it’s a case of 
The grass being greener....
It looks like a party island to me!
Ugh, I think there's two ess's in dessert man.
I’ll take an “s”. I think I want to solve it.
Unless there's milk, I won't go there."
Probably not gluten-free.
Watch our taxes go up now that they're regentrified.
I want to go there.
Every time I try to get there, Plumpy shows up!
Really makes me wish I'd learned to swim. And that I wasn't diabetic.
If only we weren’t on a low carb diet.
Ooh! Lets order in tonight.
Sso Closse
Really, the good ship lollipop?? I guess the Coast guard is a bit short of search and rescue vessels.
I have to say, that cupcake on the left sure looks good!
Yeah, the swim would be a good workout, but I'm trying to watch my carbs.
You get it?
No way, I saw the Fyre Festival documentary.
Surprisingly, none of the previous guests mentioned weʻd have this sweet view.
Do you think there are any vegan options?
I would swim, but my stomach is still upset from this island.
You're hallucinating.  It's really a McDonald's.
To be honest ,I'd rather die of hunger than diabetes
I'd be over there if I wasn't on a diet.
I would have stayed over there, but it was all a Mirage.
We should probably get over there before the ice sheets melt
Ok, so say you do make it... but then you find out everything was made without real sugar...
Look on the bright side, at least your diabetes is in check.
I know the extra S is for "sugar," but did they have to be so showy about it?
I think I just figured out why that weed we smoked was called Sativa Wonka…
My dentist is going to be so mad at me.
Oh crap! We're both diabetics?
Thank God I’m still doing Keto...
Who knew that one day we'd be able to swim from Palm Beach, FL to Sugar Land, TX.
Your theme park mirages are beginning to wear me down, bro.
We can't desert our diet, can we Bob?
Now that we swam over here I can stick to my diet.
My bet's on Marge, she knows how to get your attention.
I’d go with you but I’m on a diet.
Yeah, but do you know what that would do to our teeth without tooth brushes?
To be honest, Frank, I really don't think you need all those carbs.
But what if she's not home?
In your dreams
Well, I picked the wrong week to give up gluten
I'm not eating carbs right now.
Just because you see it, doesn’t mean it’s real.
I'm trying to cut down on carbs anyway.
Your "ex" live's there? What was the name of her lawyer?
My kingdom for an "s."
I was told I could only bring ONE thing...
Yeah, I'm not much of a sweet tooth, myself. Let's wait for the next one...
You know, when you said you wanted to blow all of our survival money on hallucinogenic mushrooms, I doubted you, I did. But you were right. This shit is dope.
In hindsight, I really should have taken those swimming lessons
Just my luck that I'm a diabetic
You go ahead. I'm fructose intolerant.
Go ahead, I'm more of a salt person.
My nutritionist would say that it's a bad idea
That desserted island looks sweet.
We were one "S" away from making this deserted island a whole lot sweeter.
No way am I swimming over there, not after what went down in that gingerbread house. I'm sugar free now
Please stop humming 'Big Rock Candy Mountain.'
I’d go, but I keep hearing my Mother say “empty calories”.
Just think of it as a mirage, since it has such a bad glycemic index.
Soon as the Good Ship Lollypop arrives, we're outa here!
Sorry,I meant dessert ...
But it's not my cheat day.
After what we did I somehow thought ‘just desserts’ would be worse than ‘just a coconut tree.’
I always knew being a spelling bee champion would hurt me in the end.
I’m on a no-sugar diet this week.
Hell of a week to start keto
Fantasy Island--it looks better than it is.
I thought they said this one had no CARS...
Besides a homonym, it's a port for The Good Ship Lollypop
It's the Big Rock Candy Mountain, thanks to global warming.
You go...Im afraid of carbs"
Remember - that’s for cheat days only
It’s tempting, but you have to remember there are good carbs and bad carbs. Those are definitely bad.
No, I'm not going over there! Have you ever tried swimming through high-fructose corn syrup?
I was thinking about going off keto.
It's because we didn't fall for their organic vegan all-you-can-eat bar
I can't decide if it's a mirage or marangue.
I hate sweets on an empty stomach
It’s as if my endocrinologist booked my travel.
”You go ahead. I went KETO the day before our ship sank!
The island is always sweeter on the other side.
Does that count as processed sugar?
Hey Gretel, what's the witch on that island doing now?
Yeh, but I gave up carbs for Lent.
I bet their cartoon contest draws better captions.
I can't have gluten ....
Nope, I'm not going. It is an obvious trap!
Sorry, I'm on a paleo diet...
You go ahead. I’m watching my cholesterol.
I’d say let’s go for a swim but I’m still on that low carb diet!
The rules of candyland seem arbitrary.
How many Weight Watchers points do you think those are?
I don't believe all of life is an illusion.
Don't, it's an evolutionary trick
Do you spell desert island with one ‘s’ or two?
I knew a guy who collected candy canes, they were all in mint condition.
I think we have a good chance of winning Castaway Confectioner.
It seems to me our chances of survival would be better on that desert island
Nah, I gotta watch my carbs.
I don’t think those pot rations worked. Agree?
I think it's one of those billionaires' islands - Richard Branson, Larry Ellison, Milton Bradley. Not sure which.
That stuff's not good for you.
If only there would be a  hamburger there I’d swim.
I need Champagne with dessert.
That's what Columbus thought too
Deserted island.  Desserted island.
Deserted island.  Desserted island.
They sound so darn similar.
Yet, they are Megalodon infested waters apart.
You wished for Candy island, not Candy land.
You idiot.
We definitely got shipwrecked on the wrong Island
It's a trap.
Oh, not me. I don't eat sugar. But you go ahead.
Yeah, but we'd be fat and thirsty.
I must have left out an ess in our dessert request?
That must be Dessert Island
Fabulous dessert buffets or not, remind me never to take The Good Ship Lollipot again.
If you ask me, The Good Ship Lollipop was built by the lowest bidder.
Life over there must be difficult too. It's not all candy canes and gumdrops.
Life's a beach.
Well I've cut out carbs and I've never looked better!
Getting there'll be a piece of cake.
Go on without me, I  prefer ice cream.
I want to get there too, but the water is infested with gummy worms.
I would. But I’m off sugar.
...and they've been hunting you for 30 years, Hansel?
We can burn off the extra calories on the swim back.
Did I mention that I was diabetic?
So this is what dieting is like!
Forget it Jake.  It's gluten-town.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
We could swim there, but I don't think we could swim back.
If only the boat hit the Jawbreaker a 100 yards earlier.
I just knew Chutes and Ladders didn't sound right
Ya, as I dentist i'm torn
Too bad we're on a low-carb diet. . .
We could've landed on a dessert island. 
But No! You insisted on this desert island.
When the brochure said actual size they really meant actual size.
I’d rather die than eat refined sugar.
But do they have palm sugar?
We knew Miami and New York were emperilled - but the Big Rock Candy Mountain?
That's for the passengers on the Good Ship Lollipop deck.
I told you this would be an easy diet to keep
What do you think, mirage or real!
I’m starting to regret slaughtering the dairy cow.
By my count this is day one hundred three, Bob.  Any chance you could let this one go by without the pun?
The way I figure it, at this rate of climate change, those goodies will be ours within five years!
Just a thought, but what do you think of Wayne Thiebaud's paintings?
Darn, we've must have missed the entree pop-up.
"It IS cheaper, sure. But if that travel agent hadn't missed the second "S" , we'd be holidaying over there instead of here on Desert Island."
If only the Good Ship Lollipop had gotten one island closer
Candy canes in July? This mirage needs to try a little harder.
Yeah, my cousins Hansel and Gretel ran a travel agency, but they were always a bit eccentric.
Ok, you got me, I ‘m not really ciliac.
Let's call it Christmas Island.
I'll bet the cupcakes it's not our imagination.
No, you can’t have dessert until you finish your vegetables.
It's too bad we're gluten-free.
I guess I’d take my toothbrush.
See,this is a "deserted" island and that is an island of "desserts."
We have to find the dentist island first.
Figures...I’m a diabetic
Yeah, I gave it up. But the sharks are still doing keto.
That’s the last time that I correct your spelling!
Damn shame we are doing keto.
Yep. The palm trees are always sweeter on the other island.
It's hard to find vegan options on the dessert cart these days
See, that’s how the obesity epidemic started back home!
dessert island has a different spelling
I see candy canes, cake and pies.... I think we have been here too long!
It's the island of misfit snacks.
One more S and we’d be eating cupcakes right now.
Aren't you grateful we can maintain our plant-based diet to the very end?
I understand they only take online orders.
Compared to that place this 
place doesn’t seem so
Sweet anymore
I’m really supposed to avoid sweets.
So this is what a carb-free diet feels like."
I hope it’s the good ship Lollipop!
Actually, I'm on the keto diet so I'll wait for the cheese island to come by. You go ahead, though.
We're just a letter away from turning our desert island into dessert.
If it weren't for my low blood sugar I'd swim right over there.
...and that's where diabetics go to die.
Gotta watch those carbs...
BMI over 30 guaranteed!
Yes, I remember a game called Candyland. Why do you ask?
What are the chances there's a dentist on that island?
I picked the wrong week to quit insulin.
I'd swim over there but I'm watching my weight.
It's OK for a mirage but it could be great with a little beefing up.
I’m slipping into a diabetic coma just staring at it.
I'm reconsidering our selection of a no-carb marooning.
A cold glass of milk sounds so good.
If you could bring one thing to the deserted island...
I told you to book premium economy, but 'Oh No'...
I know it looks tempting, but if you go to Carb Island you'll never make it back to our Paleo paradise.
That's my cheat island.
" I say it's bait, and the hell with it!"
They say you should wait an hour before going back in the water after eating.
You go, I'm watching my weight.
I'm telling you, this is the only way to go clean Paleo.
Poor timing on my no sugar diet.
Global warming sure did a number on Big Rock Candy Mountain
I'm not going. I'm Paleo you know.
I can gain weight just by looking at it.
It's been stalking us for 3 years. I think it's time to extend an invitation to meet for coffee.
For want of an "s"....
I’m used to it. Before I got stranded here, I lived in Long Island City.
I think we got the wrong suite.
I'm not in the mood for sweets or a conversation.
Johan, I can’t believe you made me wear Capri pants.
Good thing we started that diet, huh?
Everything seems enticing on the next shore
I would but I'm just not that big on sweets"
carbo island...no one ever makes it out alive
Sometimes I catch you looking at strangers the way you used to look at me.
It would just cause another crash.
What do you want for dinner?
If you were stranded over there you'd have diabetes already.
There was nothing Paleo to eat on that island. It was a nightmare!
Go ahead, I'm on the Paleo Diet.
The cupcakes are always greener on the other side.
No, I don't see a banana split boat there.
Our mirage doesn’t know how to spell.
Bob you go, I'm lactose intolerant.
But do you think there's a gluten-free option?
One of the reported side effects of my anti-depressant are vivid hallucinations.
Trump's boarder wall looks odd from here.
Nah, you go. I’m trying to watch my weight.
The last one to float by wasn’t vegan or gluten free either
But it was my New Year's resolution to cut back on sweets and we've made it two months.
I feel a little silly insisting on the correct spelling...
At least we don't have bugs on our island.
Maybe I shouldn’t have been high when I put Big Rock Candy Mountain into googlemaps.
You're still gluten-free, right?
I really wished that we'd all live in a Jello submarine, but all we got was this desserted island.
You go ahead, I’m on this Paleo kick.
On the bright side, I don't feel as bad about not packing the flouride.
Ah, what I wouldn’t do to be stranded with you on a dessert island!
Candyland is a lot more different than I imagined.
I told you the Fyre Festival was over there.
I don't intend to regain the weight I lost.
What if it's not a mirage?
I get the kids every other weekend.
I still prefer the yellow submarine.
Sorry man, I'm on the paleo diet.
We have to stay here. I'm prediabetic.
Thank god I have a sweet tooth
I always thought that a desert island would be paradise, but that dessert island looks a whole lot better!
I know I promised I wouldn't kill you in your sleep and eat you, but this island just appeared out of nowhere fifteen minutes ago and you haven't shut up about gluten.
Well this is a dilemma. Do I stick with my new years diet plan?
Next time, Sugar Island will be our destination.
Not just the grass is greener, but even the treats seem bigger on the other side!!
It's almost enough to make a person believe in global warming.
I know you said I should stop talking, but I’m sure it’s two S’s and not one.
Week 3 - Keto, otherwise I'd swim for it.
That’s Temptation Island!
Yeh, sure, and the grass is greener, too.
It's tempting...but I'm going to wait for the Good Ship Lollipop.
Isn’t it great we are on an island where we don’t have to consume all that sugar?
I think it is one of the Trans-fatlantic Islands.
I am going to swim for it. My diabetes be damned!
What would Atkins do?
And I say it was a dolphin fin.
No thanks, I just started the Atkins Diet
Eh, I don’t have much of a sweet tooth, you take this one.
Now I want to stream the music  from South Pacific.
Not reading anything, never being elected to office, not revealing our tax returns, not paying bills, hasn't worked for us.....maybe it's his diet.
We are only one  's' away
Two s’s man, TWO s’s
How long a swim do you think it is to Cheeseburger Island?
Am I a man dreaming he's a candy cane, or a candy cane dreaming he's a man?
...just waiting for my good ship lollipop to come in....
Looks tempting, but I'm trying to avoid carbs.
You been hitting the coconut water again?
My mirages are getting stranger and stranger.
Now we just wait for the tourists to arrive.
Thank god we didn't land there, it's so non-keto!
No, it's just another of those Russian temptation optical collusions!
This "deserted island" themed restaurant is a little extreme.
So, all we need is an "s" and we could be dessert island?
...Waiting for the good ship Lollipop?
I couldn't take all the sermonizing from the Oompla Loompas.
Gretel! Yes, Hansel. Can you swim?
I just think it’s important that you know - I will never dessert you.
It's too bad I'm full of coconuts right now.
Darn, I really thought for once I could stick to my Paleo diet.
Ever thought of going to America?
Don’t fret. The calories would kill us
Seems like another Disney franchise is opening
I’m not sure if it’s worth the weight.
My nemesis: the White Sugar Whale.
What will they think of next to torture us, man?
Sure we could...if we wanted to get diabetes.
You know, I had a dream like this once.
I would go... but I was taught only to eat dessert after a meal.
Ahhh...Fattening Island.
Did I ever tell you about the time I slept with my dentist?"
"Yes, you have Roger...yes you sure have.
It's one of the sweetest spots in the Carbo-bean.
Once I gave up sugar, I just stopped craving it.
Once again, others get Christmas and I have Yom Kippur.
Guess Charlie and his chocolates didn’t survive global warming.
Just my luck..I’m on a low carb diet.
"How did we land here?!?!"
Global warming sure has hurt the chocolate factory, hasn't it Charlie?
That’s a sweet island over there.
Shoot! Some guys have all the luck.
Don't even think about it.  You know you're diabetic.
If it's my last meal, I want dessert first!
I'm not in the mood for sweets.
I'd swim over, but I'm keto.  Help yourself.
You go ahead. I'm off the carbs.
Reality doth take time to sink in.
You go ahead, I gave up sweets years ago.
Do you know how to swim in chocolate syrup?
You know the saying: "If you eat it, they will come."
Medical marijuana? Who needs it when you can have hallucinations like this!
I can swim but I"m on a diet
Look, I know it looks appealing but we both know; with rewards come consequences.
Tempting, but I've gone Paleo.
Just our luck.
You go ahead, I’m trying to keep up with this diet.
Yeah, I’m pretty sure I could make it but what’s the point I’m fully paleo.
You go ahead....I’m on a low glycemic diet
I’m holding out for a hamburger.
I travel the world and the seven seas.
Everyone’s looking for something.
Go right ahead...I'm off sugar this week.
... but where are the toppings?
I prefer coconut to refined sugar.
I hear they filmed "Diabetic Survivor" there.
Do you think they have vegan options too?
The way I figure, the calories I’d take in 
would be neutralized by the swim there and back.
We could fish for protein.
Delusion or deliverance? Mirage or miracle? I never could spell to save my life.
And just when I started my all protein diet.
I hear it's an island inhabited entirely by one of Peter Pan's seven year old lost boys.
The view is so sweet.
We'll be hungry but at least we'll have good teeth.
We can afford it because the agent sweetened the deal.
Too bad the water between us is infested with carbs.
I told you we should have used Wonka Cruise Lines
I'm so happy with my ketogenic diet of coconut oil, palm leaves, and some fish. And you?
You don't need the carbs.
...I don't know. Imagine what that will do to our teeth.
Why did you have to choose the gluten free option?
Now might be a good time to try that palm tree diet that everyone is raving about?
A little seagull told me it has added preservatives
Is that the good ship Lollipop?
That's Bloomberg's island.  The taxes are ridiculous.
And I am on a sugar free diet.
You get to bring one thing. Last guy had a real sweet tooth.
I’ll never be able to swim off the calories.
I’m gluten intolerant, but you should go; you definitely need some fattening up.....
I don't care if it is a mirage, I'm going for it.
Can you do burgers, shakes and fries, too!?
Let's desert this island and go for a dessert!
I could use a vacation"
I am waiting for a gluten-free mirage
Dude,that's sweet.
My dentist would kill me.
It’ s  the  big rock candy island.
Do you think it's organic?
The downside is....where would we find a dentist?
Still on the sugar free diet?
I know it is just a mirage, but it sure looks sweet!
Remember when the North Pole was colder?
Well looks like we will be going through pain and gain.
I loved that board game.
And of course, I get stranded on NON Candyland Island.
You go, I’ll stay. I’m on a sugar free diet.
If we stay here long enough, we might get some coconuts.
And you said the good ship lollipop was unsinkable !
I hope the other side covers gluten free!
I would, but I can't swim for an hour after my lunchtime starvation.
Ya gotta expect Shirley Temple to come around the bend singing, "Good Ship Lollipop."
Do you think we should find out if it is a mirage?
Don’t worry, I’m certain the Good Ship Lollipop docks here.
No, they probably aren't made with organic ingredients.
I’m staying away from sugar these days.
You're not a dentist, are you?
Global warming, man.
Nah. I’m on the Zero-sugar diet.
I love sweets but they would just make me thirsty.
I'm not impressed, it's too much Magnolia Bakery/Dunkin Donuts, not enough Dominique Ansel.
Why didn't we land over there?
Now I really wish I'd learned how to swim.
Do you think they might be poisonous?
What is it that the sand is always sweeter on the other side?
I still say it's a secret entrance to a missile silo, and they have extra food in there.
I never had any desire to go to candyland before now.
I don’t regret our passion for dessert and the pursuit of our dreams, but in hindsight I wish we had been better spellers.
It’s our donut trap for rescue by cop!
I'd swim over with you but I'm watching my carbs.
You want to go for a swim?
I don't know. They say that sugar is bad for you.
This makes that Marshmallow Test seem like childs' play.
Charlie Bucket, this is where our Wonka dream ends.
I told you it was spelled dessert
In the desert you only can see salty snacks mirages
This way, I don't have to worry about self-control.
You know what? I'm content.
It's called the Robinson Crusoe Diet
If the sharks don’t get you first, the cigarette trees will.
Have you seen Moby Dick's new hat?
Seen any sharks?
You can go on over - I'm trying to lay off the carbs.
Home Sweet Home.
I guess it's somebody's version of Paradise Island
I knew we shouldn't have picked the gluten free option.
Well, at least over here we won't drop dead from a sugar comma!
Tempting..but there’s something fishie about it!
I prefer to see the glass half full of candy.
After ruling out a mirage, I figured it had to be the last remnant of  The Good Ship Lollipop.
I agree these resorts are amazing, but Seafood Buffet Island sounds better right now.
You see freedom.
I see diabetes!
If only I wasn't on Atkins.
So then at the end of Life of Pi". . . . .
I guess I picked the wrong day to go gluten free.
Yes, but are they vegan?
That island’s got good taste.
Since I've started the Keto Diet, I've been having this recurring dream.
It's a reminder to cancel the Dentist appointment.
I'm kicking myself for not starting that sugar-free diet next week
I distinctly remember telling you to check out the West Side.
I blame this on your public education.
At last, The Candyman arrives.
It’s a trick - they’re all gluten-free and made with Splenda.
"I know it looks like a candy shop, but it's actually an alien spaceship."
Why do I always have to be the one who worries about YOUR sugar?
Don't bother... I hear it's all gluten free.
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto.  No argument there, but when it comes to desert, dessert, I have to disagree, the difference is about 2000 calories a day!!
Yes, I did play Candy Land as a kid.
I said you can bring three things Larry.
How do you feel about our decluttering?
To be honest, lately I’ve been considering giving up the Paleo Diet.”
This sure beats being on Hutch Island with all those rabbits, George!
Thanks, but I'm on a diet.
The grass on the other side always seems to be sweeter.
My "Dessert Island" album would be Sammy Davis Jr's "Candyman".
Don’t worry: the mirages are calorie free.
Have you ever heard of the Candy Land sea monster?
I thought the map said Deserted Island.
I'm watching my sweets.
I’d suggest we swim over but I just started a Keto diet.
I,m on the Mediterranean diet. Lucky me!
....but he rolled a five not a six, so here I am. What's your story?
That's the sugar tax haven.
"Rescued? Why? We're living the sweet life!"
Green New Deal Island. You can't actually get there, but it's lovely to look at, right?
Wouldn't that be a sweet place to live?
And to think, I just started my cleanse!
We must be near Key West.
You stay here. I’ll make sure it’s safe to eat.
That was a narrow escape.
I would, but I’m off sugar this month.
Wow, that's better than the "Goodship Lollipop."
But is it worth the calories?
Let's go; there's no cop there. We know that, right?
I'm not a sweets person.
Not worth the effort - just empty calaries.
Did you receive a golden ticket also?
the hell with atkins
My guess is that they are market testing the selections.
Don’t be fooled, you’re just hallucinating.
I see your mom landed nearby after the shipwreck.
I thought it was supposed to be a Mountain ...
It must be from the Good Ship Lollipop.
Have you ever played Candyland?
I think it was the oysters
This would actually be a pretty sweet setup, 
if not for all the carnivorous Swedish fish.
So what, after eating the pine tree we swim over there for dessert?
This low carb diet sucks.
No, I don’t think any of it is vegan
Desserted Island, Ep. 2: The Tropics of Candy
I’d swim over there, but I’m cutting carbs.
So, I managed to get rid of that wasp.
It's not always sweeter on the other side.
Nah, you go ahead, I've read too many articles on sugar shortening the lifespan
Look on the bright side. At least our island is low-carb.
If I weren’t diabetic, I’d take the bait.
Suddenly I find myself humming "on the good ship lollipop."
Thank God you turned off autocorrect.
Well at least this way I can follow my diet.
Maybe the Good Ship Lollipop will rescue us and bring us to Candy Land.
Check it out. Another land mine sent to deceive us into thinking that America is great again.
One double blue card and we’re there, or it’s back to peppermint stick forest again
I guess climate change isn't all bad.
If it we're only gluten free I'd be all over that.
The thing I like about hallucinations is that they're all low-cal.
Dude, that Island is Sweet
Reminds me of when I gave up sweets for Lent.
But is a sugar high worth the loss of limb?
Ahhhh!  Candyland at last!!!
Okay, If you were stranded on a dessert island...?
I’ve heard of such a place... it’s called the Isle of Dunkin.
You go, I'll watch the fort"
Don't worry, the Candyland mirage is common in these parts.
That’s just the tip of the lobster Newburg
Nah. I want all my acquaintances to be envious of my weight loss.
No thanks, I'm trying to lose weight.
Hey  Dude! We’re stranded on the wrong desserted island.
I'm so glad we splurged for the en-sweet
My illusion was milk and honey
What are the odds that we would both be both allergic to gluten?
I Have dreamt of being stranded on a Dessert Island!
Yes, but this island is gluten-free.
Intermittent fasting
Isn't that Wayne Thiebaud hiding behind the cake?
I'm feeling more umami right now, but you go for it.
I would rather the mirage was of sandwiches.
Come on, Dave, I swear it's my cheat day.
We can't get there without the Good Ship Lollypop.
OK, OK, so Fyre Festival II wasn’t my best idea.
Can't go there ... I'm on keto.
No thanks, you swim over if you want. I'm cutting down on carbs.
That angler fish keeps getting more and more devious!
Great, that's just great! My insulin supply went down with the boat.
You didn't know which way the currents were going when you jumped..
Yeah, the mirage is the South Pacific's version of 'The grass is always greener'.
Nah, I just went gluten-free.
Well maybe if you weren’t such a stickler for spelling...
I'm sorry: the short-term rental site said, "Seaside privacy near trendy dining. and entertainment."
Let's dive in!
I'm a diabetic, but you go ahead... Enjoy yourself.
The cane is so tempting, but are you able?
I'll bet property taxes are through the roof.
My commitment to that Keto diet is starting to waver.
The swim will burn off at least that many calories!
Of course,I've embraced a gluten-free life.
Can't, I'm on a low sugar diet.
Do you think they might take a palm tree in trade?
Watch out for the hook.  It's on there somewhere.
I understand how your unhappy childhood experiences arouse suspicions, but considering neither of us can swim, isn't it rather a moot point?
I just read a study that said sweets actually help you live longer.
I would hate to mess up my Paleo Diet now...
I prefer meat. Delicious. Juicy. Meat
It's the land of plenty
No thanks. I'm on a strict coconut diet.
I wonder if it's gluten-free.
I feel like we've been waiting forever for this cocoa to cool
I think we chose the wrong  ship wreck.
Were more healthy.
I complained to the Zoning Board, but they said Disney had already started construction.
Close one,I don't think he's seeking protein!
It's a diabetics oasis!!
At least our island doesn't have any artificial sweetners
Seriously, your diabetic?  How am I just finding that out now?
Wished I'd taken swimming lessons when I had the chance.
What do you think, some kind of mirage?
This reminds me of my last diet.
I'd rather the coconuts than diabetes.
Click your heels and you'll be over there in no time.
Luckily neither of us has a sweet tooth.
Too bad you don't eat sweets.
No,thank you. I'm watching my figure.
What one thing would you bring if you were stranded on a desserted island?
Ahoy good ship lollipop . Room for two more?
That's just PERFECT! I learned I was now a diabetic right before our ship went down...
We can start the Atkins diet tomorrow.
No, it's not like pie in the sky. I say we make a try for it.
If only we were not diabetics.
That' s your idea of a breakfast mirage?"
And me, off carbs again.
Don't take the bait. The last guy that swam over there got eaten by cannibals.
Well, it wouldn't be my idea of Temptation Island, but TV producers go for anything these days.
Wouldn’t it be sweet if we could swim?
Looks like fun but we have coconuts
There is only one thing worse than getting stuck here: Diabetes.
If only we could get to Ocasio-Cortez Island.
I'm beginning to regret my sugar cleanse.
Alas, I see no chocolate bar.
Parting really is such sweet sorrow.
Why couldn't we have crashed on that one?
what happened to the lollipop?
I can't swim--and besides that, I am trying to cut back on carbs.
I can't. I'm on a whole foods plant-based diet.
Get it? DESSERT island?
Sugar island. Sugar free island. I don’t know, you’d think Mother Nature could of added a Sweet Low option.
At least we have some greenery to enjoy.
It's too bad we're cutting out sugar.
Isn't GrubHub amazing!
You're hallucinating a...what?
So, 2 likes?
Remember when we were kids? That was our treasure island
Any errors in spelling are the fault of my Iphone.
I think you forgot an “S” in the GPS.
With beach season right around the corner I’ll wait until the oasis mirage comes around again.
And YOU said I was wasting my time playing Candy Crush
I bet that's where they go when they get voted off the island.
This is one tough level, isn't it?
You go ahead, I’m doing no carbs this week.
It’s so unfair we landed on Keto island.”
Yes I can swim, but my nutritionalist has me on a strict whole foods diet.
If my memory serves me well, the trick is to get Ice Cream Floats via the Gum Drop Mountains pass without getting stuck in the Molasses Swamp.
At least we have front-row seats to Survivor: Sweets Island.
I'm waiting for door number two.
Candy Land? Truth or dare...
I am NOT saying that you're paranoid, but what if it isn't a trap?
The next time WE take the Good Ship Lollipop.
They were out of Crispy-Cremes.
We are saved, unless of course they are not gluten-free.
We’ve got our beach bods.
I love your view
You are not thinking of deserting me, are you?
Diet be damned. I'm going for it.
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
I once wrote a song about this very scene
No, I think I'd know if it was an illusion."
Evolve!
All it’s missing is a candy striper to serve it up!
Frickin' autocorrect
Of course it's real,we only took one mushroom.
I say it's a mirage and I say to Hell with it.
I think we picked the wrong deserted island
And we end up on a desert island!
I'm tired of eating dates. Let's swim over and get some real dessert!
I would, but the sugar will be the end of me.
Too bad we're on a diet.
I guess we should have read the fine print in that last Brexit deal they offered.
'The grass is always higher in calories on the other isle."
Well, there's The Odyssey, Hansel and Gretel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, ... .
I knew that my diabetes would eventually catch up with me.
Can I borrow your blood sugar monitor?
I know it’s a mirage, but I still would like to swim over there and check it out.
If I wasn't gluten-free I'd be over there in a minute.
Ya, but at least we're living the raw food lifestyle.
Grubhub?
While an excellent illustration of homophones, I'm upset you didn't wish for a boat.
I hope some have coconut.
Sorta ironic that there's no taffy, eh?
There must been a typo in the travel brochure.
I'd prefer Go Fish.
And I always thought the Big Rock Candy Mountain was in Idaho.
I always cheated on my diets, so I guess that makes ours the figurative island of just desserts.
I thought we were on Christmas Island
My doctor told me to avoid such islands.
I guess I'm just more of a savory than sweet kinda guy.
Looks like Moreau has developed a sweet tooth.
I am gluten free so those are all yours.
Who needs the hollow calories?
MAKES MY TEETH HURT JUST LOOKING AT IT.
No, I don't smell anything but I think I hear Burl Ives singing.
Candy kills, they said. Nature revitalizes, they said.
Lesson learned, Amelia. If you're planning to circumnavigate the globe, best to start with a few swimming lessons.
Not until the end of swimsuit season.
Why did you write desert? You should have written dessert!
Good.  Now we can play Candyland.
Well, so much for The Good Ship Lollipop.
I know the sugar rush won't last
“Now that’s a deserted island!!”
“Shut up mike”.
It's all gluten free.
Figures, I started my Keto diet last week!
You must be seeing a mirage... it's probably just a boat.
You're crazy man. After seeing what happened to Harry you still want to try and make it across?
Wouldn't you know, I gave up sugar for Lent.
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on you, Gretel.
I think Road Scholar undersold it
I WONDER IF THEY HAVE SUGAR FREE?
Wanna race?
I wouldn't: I saw an article on the internet about a Bavarian forest witch and her new submarine
If only I wasn't doing Keto.
surely that's  not an optcal illusion?
We are on course. Thar be Dessert Island.
I guess it’s time to take down the Christmas decorations
Ah, you remembered Christmas again.
I told you to check your spelling !
It's CandyLand!  Where are the Ice Cream Floats?
I can't. I'm staying away from palm oil.
Not sure without a tree.
It's tempting, but I have to watch my cholesterol.
I made this New Years resolutions, sooo...
Just relax and open your heart and all good things will float closer to you.
What a clever way to recycle plastic from the sea.
Not with my diabetes, thanks.
Remember that song, "Sweet dreams are made of this…".
If its a mirage, why can we both see it and why have I gained 5 pounds?
I always preferred Shoots & Ladders.
Trump should make a bridge here instead of his wall.
If we were going to be marooned I would have rathered our view was  the island of misfit toys.
The grass is greener, but our view's sweeter.
I think the cartographer had dyslexia.
Well, now we can finally have dessert before dinner...
Well, I'll need to be careful.  I have a coconut allergy.
You don't suppose they offer kale?
Looks like climate change finally got the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
They don't call it Diabetes Island for nothing!
I'm not a vegetarian! I'm a dessertarian!
Oh, to be able to "buy an 's'"
First the “pair o’ dice” incident. Now this.
Just think, if we'd spelled it with two S's, they'd have dropped us off over there.
Maybe that's The Good Ship, Lollipop, coming to our rescue!
I’m on keto anyway.
So, it's NOT desert island, smarty.  You owe me $50.
No thanks, I'm still doing Keto.
Damn!   I wish I hadn’t started Atkins!
Rethinking that keto diet?
So what happens if, when we get there, nothing is gluten free?
That drug you gave me is incredible!
I'd go for it, but I've sworn off simple carbs.
I don't eat sweets.
Sweet tooth possibility or hungry shark probability?
If that's Fantasy Island, where's the fucking plane?
At least our island is GMO free.
Now that's an island paradise!
It probably has dairy in it anyway...
NOW maybe one of the cruise ships will rescue us.
I can't. I just started my keto diet last week.
I'm sorry to be a buzzkill but do you have any idea how painful a root canal is?
Now all we need is Chutes and Ladders!
How did we end up on the island type having only one "s"?
Let's name it Candyland.
Screw the diet!
Good thing we're on a diet
I still have one 'E' coupon I hope to use!
Pretty but I’m on the keto diet.
They said climate change would be bad, but man this is rough.
Good news,  the Good Ship Lollipop should be arriving soon.
I can't wait for the Sammy Davis Jr. show tonight.
I love you, David.
Unfortunately I forgot my dessert island playlist.
I can't go over there... I'm diabetic! All that sugar would kill me!
Bad time to be on the KETO diet Hal.
Salted caramel is overhyped anyway.
It's not a craving, it's boredom.
We’re on the Keto island
You’re diabetic, dude.”
That's for my Instagram.
If that's the Candy Cane Forest, where are we?
I begged you to ask for directions!
The President heard that the Navy needed new subs, but decided that floating muffins would be better.
do you think any of that is gluten free?
I bet it's not gluten-free anyways.
I keep telling you... The Lollypop was booked.
The grass is always greener,isn't it?
Looks like we forgot an 's.'
I have the dangest luck!
A few years back I got this close to the Bog Rock Candy Mountain!
Now imagine if our deserted island had two s's..."
You said, if you could bring one thing, you'd bring me; I said, if I could bring one thing, it would be Afternoon Tea at the Ritz.
I know, but I don't want to get my hair wet"
On my cheat day, I'm going to go to town on that thing.
It’s not a big rock candy island, but it’ll do.
We lucked out, that would have been impossible to keep to our diets.
Oh yeah. That’s Toothache-Diabetes-Make ya fat Island. (Sigh) Gorgeous, isn’t it?
No, I don't see anything...you're just hallucinating...and a poor speller!
Yeah, but I don't see any of those chocolate cookies you really like.
It’s a Putin trick to lure us into voting for Trump again. Haven’t we lost enough already?
I've just been dreaming of a passing cruise ship but your Desert Island is much better. Up for a swim?
Great. Thanks Bob. We couldn’t play Chutes and Ladders, could we?
It's either a mirage or the sharks are
suckering us.  Want to go for it?
Candy Land used to be bigger, but unfortunately it was not designated for conservation.
Good Ship Lollipop?
All wasted calories -- I'm satisfied with coconuts.
There is a gap. And sometimes the inequality is inexplicable.
Yeah, but we've got a palm tree. Besides, I'm diabetic.
Maybe it is extreme, but real friends don't let their friends fail at Lent.
You can do what you want, but I am sticking with my low carb diet.
I thought it was spelled with one "s".
I mean, I guess, if you're into that kind of stuff
That's where Santa stays
None of it's on my Mediterranean diet.
I told you that we shouldn't take the Good Ship Lollypop!
The next time I say "row right" remember it's your "other" right!
...but I just started the South Beach diet.
It's totally normal on day 5 of the Whole30 to see a carbohydrate mirage
Yeah, but I bet it's all filled with palm oil too.
Oh great, I’m diabetic.
I'm trying to give up sugar.
Too bad I've given up sweets for Lent.
We didn't get a meal in Economy.
Do you think they have gluten free options?
Shhhhh, John. I think it’s playing 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.'
Damn, maybe next time
I thought we agreed that you were going to take the sunrise and I was going to sprinkle it with dew.
Now that’s a sweet island!
Chocolate, chocolate, everywhere, nor not a drop to drink.
Wow! Candy land really exists.
I would, but I'm off sweets.
Every year it seems to get closer.
Another sweets shop promotion? Sheesh!
Candy, candy everywhere but not a gumdrop to eat.
You go ahead, I'm going to hang out here.  I'm already down twenty pounds since I started this sugar-free diet.
Its tempting but I didn’t renew my dental plan.
Nothing’s as sweet as you, Mr. Crusoe.
I am totally sick of this diet."
Just my luck I'm on the Atkins Diet.
First one there gets the strawberry shortcake.
How can we tell if it's gluten-free?
Our own "sweet private island'? This is my last Fyre Festival.
My FOMO might not be cured so easily.
You go ahead.  I am allergic to sugar
Do candy canes float?
I'm going to assume they're made with the stevia plant.
Say, you wouldn't happen to be a dentist?
What's the opposite of a mirage?
This is not a good time to be on a sugar-free diet.
Okay I get it, thats a baker's dozen... so now what ?
I'm not sure if it is more likely to be a meringue or a mirage.
Still want to stay glutean free?
I figure that the good ship, Lollipop, will find its way over there--and then we'll be rescued.
My doctor said I should stay away from sweets...
I’m supplying them with all of there palm oil.
I'm off carbs
Is it just me or does Cheat Day seem to be getting further and further away?
I say we hold out for a gluten-free option.
Need I remind you again, Carl, that coconut milk is the best hydration there is?
No thanks, I'm on the keto diet."
Do you think they used locally sourced sea-salt?
Swim over and tell me if it's real or a mirage
Playing Candyland as kids didn’t adequately prepare us for this.
Do you think that is a mirage?
You Go. I'm watching my carbs.
I know it's all we were able to salvage, but we've got to stop playing Candyland.
Otherwise, I'll eat it all in one sitting.
And I thought WE were desserted.
Go for it, but I’m doing that gluten-free thing.
You can gain weight from mirages like that.
Have I mentioned I’m diabetic?
This Candyland diet is a tad extreme.
Just our luck: we’re both diabetic.
Its a great skyline from here, but I am so glad we decided to move to the suburbs.
Go ahead, but I’ll pass. I doubt it’s gluten free.
Wave them bye and we'll wait for the entre'  wagon
Is this a test of my dieting will-power
I know a game we haven’t played in a long time.
5 desserts to bring on a deserted island. Go.
Stay strong, Frank. Remember: neither one of us is a dentist...
It's the same,only decadent.
I know. But sugar makes you angry.
True, but the gluten ...
Day 29 of  The Whole 30.
He would never admit it, but that's what my dentist wants me to eat.
If we could be sure it was gluten-free---
Might know, I'm diabetic...
This morning, I swam half way there, but then got too tired so I swam back here.
It always appears right after we barbecue.
Now we'll see if you've really given up sugar!
...More like straight to my THIGH-land."
I guess we'll never find where the Good Ship Lollipop went down.
I would, but I'm on my second week of keto.
Must be that new dessert island I heard about.
... and I thought Candy Land was make believe!
Sorry, I only do gluten-free islands.
Hey, where did the castaways on the other island go?
Figures, just when my cholesterol levels are perfect...
You did say my company would be sweet enough.
Sure, let’s go for it; a diabetic coma is the last thing on my mind.
It's the flying saucer from carb hell.
No thanks, I lost my sweet tooth with the scurvy.
Not me. I didn't pack a toothbrush.
No, we can't, our swimming coach put us on a no carb diet, remember?
Because of my sweet tooth i’m all washed out.
Goodbye teeth.
Well at least Frye festival catered in some food this year...
Dieting  is tough.
I can't, I'm on the keto diet.
It's times like these I regret going gluten-free
Only if you are a dentist.
Santa has to show up on Christmas Island eventually, right?
Even if I could swim over, they’re probably not gluten free.
I said, I think we're sitting on the pastie of a submerged giant, not the pastry!
When I was a kid, no one believed me when I said that there really was a Candyland
Are you sure sugar causes cancer?
Wait. Didn’t you say you were giving up sweets for Lent?
That can’t be real.  Any self respecting candy cane wouldn’t stick its neck out like that!
What luck!  A dentist who can’t swim!
Don't go there. There's too much sugar in the average diet.
Man I could go for an Almond Joy right about now.
Think that's keto?
No ice cream?
Wait a minute! How can we both be experiencing the same hallucination?
If only I had gone to Harvard
I wouldn't eat something sweet if my life depended on it.
It became a dessert island after the wreck of the Good Ship Lollipop washed up
I don't know, man. Do you think they are Gluten-free?
It's just Blubber playing tricks again.
I could never spell correctly "Dessert or Deserted"  Who cares?
...and that’s the Recreation Center.
They say that the grass is always higher in high-fructose corn syrup on the other side.
Is that with one or two s's?
It's really more of a sometimes place.
This isn't what I meant when I said I was giving up sweets for Lent.
I would but for the gluten.
Well, they were right, it really isn't greener on the other side. It just really sweet.
I'm on the Paleo diet.
I guess you're newbie in mirages.
So, sweet dreams tonight ?
I'm watching my diet.
I thought Fantasy Island got cancelled.
It may be a mirage....and those may be sharks....but I'm going' for it anyway!
That’s the Isle of White Sugar.
Playing that game is what got me here.
I'd swim over but Dick Cheney visits there and look what happened to him
Nah, I’m on paleo.
Giving up carbs and sugar is hard, but after a few days, you’ll find you’ll just see them everyplace and everywhere.
I think we misunderstood
No doubt Sirens disguised as dessert.
I wouldn't touch it.
Guess all we had was a yellow ticket.
You go ahead, I'm still on a coconut jag.
It’s a mirage. You see yummy desserts. I see a yummy floating breast.
I'll swim it, but my cheat day isn't until Saturday.
You go ahead.  I'm not much of a sweets person.
I get high just looking at that sugar mirage.
Yeah, it looks good, but no coffee to go with it? Meh.
Now that's what i call a "desserted" island, pluhhh
It’s just a come-on.
Sweet or savory?
No thanks. Nothing is gluten-free.
So, do you have a sweet tooth?
Well, there's plenty of fat and sugar. All we need is salt.
Sweet, man...
I’ve definitely reached a state of ketosis.
Stranded on a dessert island also means cavities, you know.
Supposedly this cures our lack of self control
You go, I'll stay here and guard the giant lollipop
No, if only one of us sees it, it would be a hallucination. It must be a mirage since both of us are seeing it. Still, it doesn't look like much of a swim.
LOOK ! another desert island
Mirage or not, we don't need any more cavities.
Yeah, I'm not into sweets either, but I wonder if any drinkable water's over there.
...One more 's' and we'd have hit pay dirt...
At least we won’t get diabetes.
You go. I'm getting ready for swimsuit season.
John, how did we end up on the wrong deserted island?
Sweets have never been my thing.
Now there's where we need a wall!
I know, but this whole 'stranded-on-a-desert-island' cliché prevents us from swimming.
But you know you can’t eat just one recommended serving. I’ll wave them off.
Aw shucks. Shoulda brought the kids.
I wonder if they also have big juicy Kosher hotdogs?
Too bad I have to watch my blood sugar!
No way, man. It’s all carbs and fats..and your toothbrush is where?
Pity it's all  turned green.
So that was the main course. What's for desert?
I miss Steve too, but you can't have sweets on keto
Knowing our luck, those cakes will not be gluten free!
Now don't be spoiling your dinner.
It was the Big Rock Candy Mountain before the icecaps melted, just like this was Everest.
I told you there was a difference between the islands!
It's for the best. I forgot my toothbrush.
I wish you wouldn't be such a stickler about spelling.
What if it's a mirage? Our epitaphs would read like a joke.
You go ahead. I'm off carbs.
It's like GrubHub, but it's called 'SweetFleet."
I wonder if the expiration date for the baked goods comes before our own.
I’m diabetic, swim to the other side and see if you can spot any protein bars.
Ready for a sugar high!
Figures I just started my no carb diet!
Of all the islands in this ocean, we ended up on one drawn by a good speller!
Yes, but that one is an uncharted 'dessert' isle."
Who knew mirages could be so punny?
Well ..... Just think of all the calories we'll save."
What do you think Wilson?
I don’t know Chuck, it looks kinda fishy!
And that, my son, is the virtue of being vegan.
Just my luck, my cardiologist has me on a strict low cholesterol diet.
That's why we don't spell ours with two "S"s
Just our luck....I am off sugar.
And I gave up sweets for lent.
I miss the glaciers, too, but at least we still have part of the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I’m actually doing Whole30 right now. But please, don’t let me stop you.
Sometimes I'm sorry that i'm on the Atkins diet
Being on a no carb diet is getting harder all the time.
Sugar on our coconuts would be nice.
They have a more effective branding strategy.
Phillip stop staring; your blood sugar will spike!”
Before you take the plunge, consider your diabetes.
Don't forget - they are wrong, we are right.
"Never Mind,,, I'm going to take a quick dip,,,,"
They spelled it wrong.
The Good Ship Lollipop?
Even Hasbro has an island.
Seriously?  They  must not know we live in L.A.
I'm not a "sand is always browner" kind of guy.
Fortunately I’m paleo.
It’s a stroke of luck, really.  I’m keto this week.
I hate to keep saying it, but it's a shame the water's infested with piranhas.
Looks like the candy man REALLY can!!
Don't you just love Jeff Koonz?
They’re probably not even vegan.
I never trust unsolicited gifts.
Go ahead...go over there and eat all of that.  But, don't come cryin' to me when you need a dentist.
Well, at least we can play Candyland.
I totally chose the wrong day to start Keto!
Remember what mom said: your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
Darn autocorrect, I said , “I want to book a flight to Dessert 
Island”!
Looks like Candyland. I'm a gamer. I say go for it.
What I wouldn't give for another "s."
Damn it, and just when I'd gone keto.
Nothing will grow over there.
Oh look, candy cane trees have sprouted. It must be getting close to the holiday season.
A pity we're both diabetic
It's probably a manatee.
The magic Genie had a lisp and that’s what an extra ‘S’ will get you.
Don't   be   fooled.  It' another   GOP  tax scam.
Roll again, a double six gets us there
Dibs on the cupcakes.
Do you know how to swim?
I never really liked Candyland.
You mean the one that’s covered in cheese and avocados?
We're on South Beach and it sucks.
I say let's screw the South Beach diet.
In their defense, they didn't have a lot of island to dessert.
I thought you said there was a desserted island across the way.
Hell of a place to develop cavities.
With my triglycerides being what they are I am glad we didn't end up there!
You enjoy it...I'm on this elimination thing.
I call that the "socialist mirage island". Lots of free stuff but what you don't see is the sharks swimming underneath.
I'm watching my carbs.
Don't even think about it. Sugar's gonna kill us faster."
You're right, it's two esses because you want seconds.
Once upon a time they were called the  Big Rock Candy Mountains.  Now mostly underwater, turned to salt water taffy.
Not really feeling like desert tonight.
It's made of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
They say he’s the Jeff Koons of baking.
Betcha a night under the palm that the giraffe on the left finishes his cupcake first.
It's tempting but I get just enough carbs from our coconut water.
Now ask yourself if it’s been worth it.
Nahh!its mostly corn sweeteners, anyway.
Just remember, you're still counting carbs.
It's tempting but I'm still trying to drop a few pounds.
They’ll be back when they realize we’ve got the toothpaste.
Well, Candy, there goes your land.
On the bright side, the lines at the dessert table are shorter now that the ship sank!
And we were almost there, until you had to draw Molasses Swamp.
I would go for it, but I can tell they're not vegan.
Looks like that fake restaurant-display crap from here.
Have you seen any sharks?
It's either a mirage or Disney just launched a new cruise ship called Sugar Mountain
Enticing, but I'm diabetic.
You think they might be gluten-free?
You go ahead. I’ ve got problems with gluten.
It's an easy swim, but I think we should resist.
If only this place had a second S.
High in sugar,
high in fat,
let's just stay right
where we're at.
Candy Crush saga.
Lv. 2.
I'm starting to think we're just a fancy cake decoration.
I can’t believe I made a spelling mistake on my wish trip form.
I'm watching my waistline, but thanks, anyway.
It's a mirage.  Actually, I see Sean Connery, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise!
We could easily swim over there but it would be breaking my diet.
Life is always sweeter on the other side of the shark infested sea.
Don't be upset, its the foods that will shorten your life anyhow
They cut their tree to compete in the Top Chef  Just Desserts contest.
Disney World was much better!
You'll burn off the sugar and carbs swimming there and back.
Should we make a swim for it or is it a fat trap?
I'd make the swim but beach season is right around the corner
Stop!  That's how we ended up here in the first place.
No,  I doubt that stuff is gluten-free.
To think I gave up junk food.
‘Yes that is Peppermint Bay’
You really are a stickler for this whole no carb no sugar thing.
The grass always looks greener on the other side.
No, I'm on gluten free
It's just a plot to make you give up your diet
This diet retreat is clearly working.  All those sweets have lost their appeal, but are we expected to swim home?
It's times like these I'm glad my parents pushed me through dental school.
I wish I hadn’t given up sugar
And they said being Paleo would pay off...
Not today. I’m watching my figure.
I'm tempted to put sweet treats back in my diet.
Did they misspell desert?
Diabetes is a bitch.
Dessert islands—that one extra "s" will kill you with carbs.
You can try to swim for it, but I'm staying on my low carb diet.
If I remembers me small uninhabited islands, that would be Cake Island.  Odd name for an island, I’d say.
I gave it up for Lent.
Whatever you say, Willy Wonka, just don’t mention coconut shrimp...
At least we don't have to worry about diabetes.
If only they were gluten free.
I agree it's tempting, but I'm strictly keto.
It's tempting, but remember, sugar is really bad for your health.
Too bad I just started keto.
I understand that you're diabetic but you couldn't think about me?
I could get over the loss of the boat, but to be stranded on the wrong island …
I,d love to swim over there but I,m on a sugar free diet
It reminds me of the Good Ship Lollipop.
The good ship "Lollipop" should be here any day now.
Well, one of us is going to have an epic dessert.
You’re better off without all those empty calories.
What'd you expect, a big rock candy mountain?
No, I was seeing the cupcake island yesterday.
But where will we get our teeth cleaned?
Somehow it seemed sweeter in my memory
Let's take  a chance and swim there. Maybe it's not artificially sweetened.
Sweet dude.
Yes, but what would our dentist say
Go figure,you can't swim and I'm on a protein only diet.
Tom Brady says cake clogs your arteries
When we've totally depleted all of Earth's resources, we'll just move to Mars. But for now...race ya to the cupcake!!!
Go ahead without me, I’m doing keto.
Last week it was giant bottles of diaper rash cream.
My bad... It's supposed to be milk and honey..
No I've never been to a Trump rally. Why do you ask?
Fake news, I say
Well, I had always known about Grandpa’s stories about the mountain, but I thought Big Rock Island was a complete myth.
Sandy Candy Land
So that's Hedonism?
Maybe next time we should try Weight Watchers
It may look good but all that sugar will kill you.
Are you still on the low-carb diet?
Don't go there, it'll mess with your head.
I'm proud of you for sticking to your cleanse.
Here's the question. Do you want to be the first one to go, or the second one?
I don't have a sweet tooth after all that coconut.
Too much salt in the diet can make you see things.
Yeah, but the carbs.
That's the English language for you, a real kick in the teeth
Damn! I gave up carbs for Lent.
'You've really bought into the "sugar is not good for you" thing?'
So, how's your A1c?
That island over there is called Moderation, and in it, you can have everything.
Winner take all!
Since you picked this g*@  d*#@  island, I get to pick the next one.
Empty calories are still calories.
I thought that extra 'S' would cost more, so I settled for this desert one instead.
Do you see food or calories?
The contest among deserted islands is really heating up
I bet they're all coconut flavored anyway...
It must be one of Picasso's unconventional sculptures that make us hallucinate.
And now I have another diner, rather than dinner...
This was the wrong week to go gluten-free
Maybe my parents were right when they said I lacked initiative."
It's the Venus Man Trap clam again.
You can't swim on a full stomach—we'd be stranded!
Shucks, I'm not doing sugar and starches now.
Do you think it's a trick?
Oh definitely! Food can really solve all the problems when it's not one of them.
Stevenson had his Treasure Island, and I have mine.
Looks are deceiving. That’s a Candy Shark!
You ever have a root beer float?
It's Diabetes Island!
Don't you think its time you laid-off the saltwater?
Yeah, you can go there, but just don't ever write about it.
Good thing we're 'both diabetic and don't know how to swim.
Don’t think about candy. Think about diabetes.
Maybe if you weren't so fatalistic the good stuff would wash-up here
I've 'eard of the Isle of Wight, but a bloke could gain a lot of wight on that isle, eh?
I picked the wrong time to start my Keto program
But where's the milk and honey?
They all died with diabetes!
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
Our island needs another 's'
I thought you said it would be easy to do the keto diet out here!
I'd swim for it except I'm sugar intolerant.
I think it's an all points bulletin from Weight Watchers.
And I thought Big Rock Candy Mountain was a fantasy.
It's a mirage. Don't you have more interesting fantasies?
Just one more "s" ....
It's the ghost ship of Christmas past.
And to think, if it wasn’t for a few sharks, that would all be ours.
Repeat after me: It's just one S, like in "Sahara."
Maybe it's just me, but I feel like we might've gone a little overboard with our New Year's resolution to diet...
I'm gonna kill ya, y'know...
Paul, aren't you glad you're here with me . . . you could be alone on that dessert'd island.
Vegan island, I’m weakening
It's nothing but empty calories anyway.
Seriously? ....you don't see the candy canes?
No, let's wait for Vegan.
Its called watching your diet.
No. There is no way Shirley Temple’s over there.
Maybe we should go help them out. I hear they're in a State Of Emergency!
Even if it is only a mirage, I bet it tastes great!
I say we swim over and get baked!
I think it wants to mate.  We could use the space.
We could swim over, but how would we get it back?
In retrospect, escaping Sweet Island may have been an ill-conceived enterprise.
It's a dessert mirage, not the more common desert mirage....
It wasn't there yesterday. And what happened to all the sharks that were swimming around here then?
We're thousands of miles from civilization and any other human beings.  Of course it counts as Paleo.
Of course, I'm concerned. But I really think the swim will offset the A1C spike.
At least we have a tree to sit under to share this hallucination.
Life sure is better with chocolate.
We could swim over, but the calories, you know?
Life isn’t fair. The Good Ship Lollipop goes down and this is where we wind up?
Did I mention I signed up for swimming lessons?
Empty calories and gluten. We've got a coconut.
I 'd swim over there, but I'm trying to stick to my diet.
I’m glad we already had dessert...!
I told you not to sink over here
My dentist would be happy about the sharks.
That ever elusive number on the glycemic index - it's a fantasy.
This keto diet is getting harder and harder
Actually, my kids prefer Chutes and Ladders.
#BetterWithMilk
This way we have something to strive for.
What do you mean you can't swim?
Yeah, but there is no milk.
Mirage, shmirage
I guess we really fudged up with our choice of island.
That’s Insulin.
Go ahead.  Not me, I’m on the paleo diet.
I've been gluten free for so long that I think I'm seeing things.
Will you be my Valentine?
Yep Zak, it's the big rock candy island.
Of course it's a risk Herman, but they might be gluten free.
Would love to, but I'm pretty sure it's not gluten-free.
Then it came to me -- coconut cream!
They say it's mostly made from palm oil, but it still isn't keto.
Let's have sex and see if it's still there.
I guess they're sick of seafood.
It's the Big Rock Candy Island. Wanna swim for it?
Well at least we won't get cavities.
Try to be more positive! At least we won’t get cavities over here...
We always do this around the Holidays
It depends, if the wind blows from that way, it smells like peppermint.
It's OK, I just went sugar free.
I guess when I said “desserted” he heard “deserted”
Your wife locked the pantry too?
Careful buddy, that's the corporate headhunter that persuaded me to jump ship
True, but the coconut always looks sweeter on the other side.
Bummer, I was using this " me time" to cut out sugar.
Too bad my New Year's Resolution was to cut out sugar.
I told you I wanted to go to the desserted island--not desert island!. You see the difference one "s" can make?
I'm not really a sweets guy.
No, I haven’t heard a peep.
Looks like we picked the wrong time to go gluten free
Just keep reminding yourself, not going over there
could save your life
i don't care for sweets
I'm really not that into sweets, Jim.
Should we reconsider our paleo diet?
Marooned. What a difference the 'ca' makes.
I am glad. we are here.  Too many tourists on the other one.
You go ahead - I'm cutting out sugar this month.
At least you can burn off the calories swimming there and back.
Good thing it's only a mirage cause we're diabetics.
With my luck, it's probably not gluten-free.
I see you confuse them too.
Good thing I’m diabetic
You have great hair.
Don’t judge - Survivor Candy Land is probably compelling TV...
It's called the Isles of Insulin."
We’re millennials.  The “Land of Milk of Honey” has been downgraded too.
"Give us the palmtree.
It was easier to keep up with the Jones' s back home.
Wish I could swim.
Too bad you're gluten-free, huh?
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted to cut out desserts.
I told you the minimalism craze would come back to bite us
Shall we dine on the island or float it all back on the donut inner tube?
It’s a common mistake. Believe it or not I actually like deserts more than desserts.
Think of the health consequences of being stranded on that treeless confection.
I already have a cramp and we haven't even started to swim.
Well, we're lost boys, aren't we?
But I'm diabetic.
I'm paleo so I'd never touch it, but it's pretty to look at.
Maybe we're on two humps of an underwater Bactrian Camel.
Grass is always greener on the other side
Well, I am on the Mediterranean diet.
What you bet, there’s not a single gluten-free  piece?
Fyre Festival 2019
If you clean up your room you may have some.
Just as well neither of us can swim, Harry. Can you imagine what that stuff would do to your teeth
I'm on a gluten free diet, but you go ahead.
And there goes our fantasy island drifting away...
The grass is always greener with you, Arnold.
Look at that.  And I always thought it was the land of milk and honey.
We’re just one typo too short.
It's called the military-industrial complex.
We should've taken our toddler swimming lessons more seriously.
Just our luck, no keto...
I would swim over, but I’m on a diet.
I could swim across, but I'm on a low carb diet.
Well, it looks good but you know I'm on this diet...
No way. I've gone gluten-free.
Funny, my last flashback was in 1998, but I don't remember the candy canes.
I get the periscopes but whats the rest of the junk.
Have you ever read 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain'?
Since I've been on this diet, I no longer crave refined carbs.
Neverland?
You go ahead, I promised my wife I would give up sugar, so I'm going to stay here and die of starvation.
Welcome to fantasy island for diabetics.
I always thought the Big Rock Candy Mountain was in Wyoming.
Dang, I wish I hadn’t started my diet
My mother always said I had to eat my main course before dessert.
Coconuts and eggs have their place but sometimes you have to eat dessert first.
I'm off sugar.
So we can't swim. it's a mirage anyway.
I prefer a Big Mac and fries.
How many points?
I call it the Big Rock Candy Atoll!
I’d swim over but I’m trying to cut calories.
Let's hope the cannibals have a sweet tooth.
At least we don’t have to count calories.
...and visions of sugarplums floated in our heads.
You go ahead. I’m Pre-diabetic.
Think the owner is as big as his candy?
Everyone told me I needed a better divorce lawyer...
"Don't even think of humming Big Rock Candy Mountain."
Let's paddle over and snitch the candle canes.
We could always wash it down with our own urine.
It's not worth the swim...I forgot my toothbrush...
Still waiting for the Good Ship 'Lollipop.'
I'd swim over but I gave up sugar.
You do know that sugar rots your teeth right?
At this point, I'd be happy if they swam over here and ate me.
I don't care what the travel brochures say.  It is definitely NOT the land of milk and honey.
Betcha' none of those goodies are vegan!
I don’t care that it’s ON the south beach. You still  can’t eat that stuff until phase 11 of the diet.
It’s no big rock candy mountain but it might be a try
Nah, I started my keto diet last week.
Lucky for me you are on the no sugar diet!
Save room for desert island.
You go.  I can't.  I'm prediabetic.
If I weren't a diabetic, I'd be over there in a second!
I would, but I've given up sugar for lent.
If you pick one your FB page will be filled with related ads for eternity.
Nah, I’m on a diet.
Well that wouldn't have fit our no carb lifestyle anyway.
'Remember the one time you skipped swimming lessons?'
Lots of people eating healthy these days.  It’s called the island of misfit carbs.
I've come to hate Burl Ives.
Are we on the wrong island?
I think we landed on the wrong deserted island.
Nah, it's probably not gluten-free.
Whew! I thought we’d never get off Sugar-Addict island! I’ve heard  coconuts are really good for you, we’re safe now.
Seems to me we landed on Keto Island.
Sunsets are beautiful in this island
Looks like I picked the wrong week to go gluten-free.
The travel agent said it was only one ‘s’
That's called the Isle of Fructose Death.
I'm not afraid of sharks. I have a gluten allergy.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to start the Paleo diet
My dentist would definitely approve of our situation.
Really? I see 2021.
It's true, Diabetes Island doesn't appear on any maps.
I thought the brochure promised ‘milk and honey’.
What a difference one "s" can make when it comes to islands.
No shade over there. Think I'll stay put.
It's a shame we're both diabetic.
If I wasn't legally blind, I would say for certain that there's a big island over there covered in sweets and that's where you've been going when you take your little afternoon dips. But I know that's just the starvation talking.
And here I am a diabetic>
Being "Gluten Free" is a lifetime commitment.
I think I'd prefer to stay dry.
Whatever happened to the Chutes and Ladders island?
I'd recommend swimming over there if there was something nutritious to eat
Well, Hansel, what do you think?
It seems that gluten free island is not so good.
...talk about childhood wishes...we could even eat the dishes...
Dude. It'll be like Harold and Kumar go to White Castle!
At least we can stay low-carb.
Just be thankful for palm oil.
Why would I tell the shark you have a sweet tooth?
"We're saved! Java must be close behind!
But what if we need to go to the dentist?
I didn't realize you see other people's deserted islands from your deserted island.
It reminds me of that place in Maine that’s spelled like ‘desert’ but pronounced like ‘dessert’.
The It’s the good ship lollipop.
You had one wish! Did you have to bring me down with you?
Willy Wonka's Island.
We can't swim over there without a passport...Should we apply for asylum?
Hell no! I just got my cholesterol and blood sugar under control.
Just our luck, Martians with a sweet tooth, and neither of us can swim.
Dang it, I'm diabetic
Great concept for a themed restaurant, but no one could convince him the location was wrong.
What about our pledge to go Paleo?
What a time to start my low carb diet.
But it is not really the "Good Ship Lollipop"!
I wonder if there are gluten-free options?
Even if it is a mirage, let's swim over"
It's spelled with two "s", because you always want more.
Their cannibalism options are better there
Sure it’s tempting. But remember- you’re down to your last pair of pants.....and they’re size 32.
It seems Emperor Wonka has expanded his empire.
It's all yours. I'm on a paleo diet.
"I did not know until just this moment how much of a drag it is being a diabetic."
If I made that swim, how many calories do you think MyFitnessPal would give me to play around with?
I'm on a low-carb diet anyway.
Sure, and we can just walk right on over there, too.
The gluten-free options have really come a long way.
I bet none of it’s gluten free though.
They never asked you If you could take five things to a deserted island what would they be?
Yeah, but they said J-Lo would be on this island.
You crave it now - next thing you know, you‘re covered in whipped cream fighting a sugar shock.
Was purposefully sinking the ship really necessary to show me how annoying your diet is?
It’s all yours, I’m all about Keto.
At last, junk food with natural ingredients!
That has to be a mirage, right?
I can't believe I gave up sugar last year
I heard that's where the second annual Fyre Festival is gonna be held.
If you do go over there I just want a little bit.
Trust me, I read all about it and this diet will definitely work!
what...ever

They're all out of Sweethearts for Valentines Day too
Yeah, but now I wish I'd made "Rescue Me" my top Desert Island Disc instead of "Big Rock Candy Mountain"
There’s one “s” in dessert, isn’t there?
Not much protein there.
Where is The Good Ship Lollipop when you really need it?!
I told you not to drink the water here
Neighbor's candies are always sweeter
If it's that pesky Martian salesman again, tell him we already have dental insurance.
Nah, it’s Kale disguised as dessert.
It’s just not in line with my paleo diet.
Stressed the wrong syllable in the first word too, huh?
Quite a journey from the Big Rock Candy Mountain!
I hope it's a mirage. My doctor told me to lay off sweets.
Reality Board Games
You really think your low carb, low sugar diet created this mirage?
Yeah, but now that it's just us, I'm kind of full.
Sure, but there is not a dentist or a toothbrush in a 1000 miles.
Fyre Festival 2: Dessert Island
It's not very far..but Dr Atkins also sent some sharks

I mean, I hear some witches are actually pretty nice.
I wonder if it has pretty lights at night.
And I was wishing for Chutes and Ladders!
If we could swim, that would be sweet.
I'd like to see their HOA monthly fees!
Really?  You swam from there to here, because this island had what you wanted !
I’d join you if it were any other board game.
Yeah, but it's not allowed on my paleo diet.
They've appeared there to test us.
Yes, it’s close and there are no sharks, but no vegetables could mean a trap.
Well, you're the one who wanted to go "all in" with the keto diet....
They're probably not gluten free anyway.
Tempting, but think about the calories.
I know it’s tempting, but think of the carbs.”
Let's swim over today. The Big Rock Candy Mountain ain't gonna be around much longer.
And to think I gave up sweets only last week...
is the good ship lollipop a submarine?
Would you please stop singing : "The Big Rock Candy Mountain!"
It's lucky we landed on the low glycemic island.
Starbucks is really branching out.

Could be a mirage.  What do you think?
Pick a card.
My diabetes is the only thing keeping me from racing you.
Candy Island is a bit of a mouthful for a board game, don't you think?
I'm sure we can't win the war against sugar.

Think they're sugar free?
I picked the wrong week to quit carbs.

I just really wish we could play Candyland
All I'm saying is, maybe next time you manifest something you could be a little more specific, seeing as neither one of us knows how to swim.
Go for it. I'll wait for the In'n Out burger delusion.
Can you believe I gave up Sweets for Lent.
Sometimes one little ‘s’ can make all the difference.

Ahoy, Good Ship Lollipop!
So near..
So far
I keep waiting for the hot fudge sundae .
OK, so it's not a mirage. Now, how about that shark that's circling it?

Yeah but its all gluten-free
I'm not unless you'll have some, too.

It wasn't MY idea to eat the canoe-li.

Say what you must about climate change, but it's done wonders for my diet.
Too bad I'm on a no added sugar diet.

what could've been
Big sugar wants you to swim over
Too bad you are a diabetic.
Ever watch that show, Shark Tank?
Race you to Candy Land?
That’s Hansel’s Island.
Yes, but you know everything over there has coconut icing.
Stop pestering me, Brandon. No dessert before dinner.
I've been doing KETO for a month.  How bout you?
And you say that giants don't live here.
Well, we didn’t make it to Cuba, but that island over there doesn’t look
Too bad!
But I thought that once my kids were grown, I wouldn’t ever have to play Candyland again.
Too heavy on carbs. I say we wait for the next one.
It’s moments like this that really test your resolve to live gluten-free
Sure they're calories, but they're just empty calories.
I would have been over there a long time ago but there's no dentist on this island.
If you survive the sharks and the currents would you ask them if they have any gluten free options?
It's like a dessert cart, only we have to swim there.

Maybe our Fyre Festival package sent us to the wrong island by mistake."
While liquor is quicker... Candy sure is dandy!
I tell you, this is a mirage, this is ONLY a mirage!. They don't deliver to this address!
I believe that our tree is healthier than that mirage
I guess we'll have to buy "Chutes and Ladders" in order to play "Candyland."
Being marooned is no excuse to punt your diet.
Are you kidding? I don't want diabetes.
Thank goodness I’m gluten free.
This is your mirage, go for it, a month ago I swam to cruise ship passing by.
If she calls that one Candy, what does she call this one?
I could use this to feel bad about my life, but I've never really liked the taste of salty with sweet.

It's your move!

It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.
Sure, I could make the swim, but I've been trying to cut back on high-fructose corn syrup.
It may be a hallucination but it looks yummy!
To hell with your diet.  I say go for it.
No, I'm diabetic. But you go right ahead.

Ze Candy Cane! Ze Candy Cane !"
I swear I just saw a midget behind the cupcake yelling, "Boss, the plane the plane!"  Maybe we swim over there.
Think of it this way: we'll have so many fewer cavities to search at customs.
It figures,  I just started my low carb diet.
I am thinking of re-decorating our island
No, I don't regret springing for the all-inclusive package. Do you?
Sure.   But we don't have a dentist.
Do you think it's funny?
What would YOU do if you were stranded on a dessert island?
When did you start the Atkin’s diet?
My ex-wife would brave the risk.
Of course I'm a diabetic
Hm... Candyland seemed so much bigger as a child.
I'm saving 'Dessert Island' for after we find 'Balanced Meal Isle'.
Nevermind. I'm on a diet, anyway.
Of course it deserted. Santa Clause abandoned it after the ice caps melted.
And me a diabetic ..(heavy sigh)
This might be my pre-spring break juice cleanse talking, but that sandbar looks like a cheesecake.
Mirage or not, my gluten allergy eliminates the temptation.
Let’s make a gluten free  exception, it will be full-on and guilt-free.
Tough on the diet, Clyde.
If it's not sugar free, low carb, non GMO, gluten free, organic, vegan, fair-trade certified I'll pass.
Nope!  I'm sticking to my diet.
Can't go with you--my doctor has taken me off all that stuff.
Must be a new version of Candyland.
Can you believe it -- the good ship Lollipop turned out to be an atoll.
I hope it's gluten-free.
Nah, never going back. No sugar coma's worth it.
I'm sure we're allowed.There's no fruit of the tree over there.
Candy crushed
Let's wait,watch who lands on Dessert Island...
Too bad we started keto on Tuesday, huh?
‘I hate to tell you this, but I can’t swim’
‘That’s ok, I’m doin the keto diet’
Pity you’ve gone off sweets
Yeah, but we agreed to eat less sweets.
You know refine sugars and carbs will kill you.
I'd love to swim over with you, but I didn't finish my vegetables.
But we have the coconut milk to wash it all down.
I think it's the Good Ship Lollipop
So far, I don’t like “Handsel and Gretel at Sea.”
That dessert isle looks tempting, but sugar and gluten are really just empty calories.
What about your sugar-free, gluten-free diet?
It's a part of making this diet work longterm"
I guess you signed up for the sugarfree cruise.
So you going first?
On the bright side,this arrangement allows us our desire.
There must be a gluten-free island around here somewhere.
Too bad I'm on Atkins.
I know how it looks Gretel, but are you sure it's not the witch?
It looks like Coney Island to me
Well, it's no big deal.  I'm on a low sugar diet.
Darn Amazon Prime.  This was to celebrate our rescue, in twenty years.
Do we have the kahunas to swim to that mirage?
No one tells you the Whole 30 will make you feel so alone
I don't think that candy cane would provide enough protection from the sun.
I'm on a 'no sugar' diet.'What's your excuse?
So that is where it is.
Let’s hope my Uber doesn’t get confused.
It's called just deserts island; they're not gluten-free.
Don't bother. It's all gluten-free.
I'm actually glad! Imagine what all those saturated fats would do to my waistline.
This is the most intense diet I have ever tried.
Let's enjoy the view while we can. A wall would be built soon!
So, Hansel, is this a twenty first century version of the witch and her gingerbread house?
Okay you’ve done that joke enough times, thank you Kevin...
Glad we didn’t land there. I’m sugar and gluten free
I don't care if it's just a reward, Pavlov.
Well, at least we're not on the COMPLETELY desserted island.
I thought mirages only occured in the desert!
I heard there was an outbreak of diabetes that claimed all the lives there.
I wonder if there’s a dentist on the island?
I hope this isn’t our LAST course!!!
I swear you said ‘sandy island’.
I think you're right.  This Paleo diet  of ours has lost its appeal.
Years ago that was Candyland, now it’s Cholesterolland.
Remember mom told us no sweets until after dinner, so it’s a no go.
Why do coworkers always bring sweets on the day I am starting my diet?
Clearly there was no escape from the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic
Don't even think about it. That's where Oprah keeps her stash.
i wonder if they have a vegan option
If we swim over there together, this one will be, too!
Did you see the ‘Good Ship Lollipop’ pass by here?
I'm actually gluten free.
Dude, I told you playing Candy Land would come in handy.
That's Mark Zuckerberg's island.
Tempting, but I'm on a strict low-carb diet."
My doctor advised me to stay away from Sweets
I told you we shouldn't have drank the salt water.
Let's just say that I am an optimist, but that's simply far too many calories.
I wish the mirage was low-cal.
You just had to have coconut toppings!
I wonder if any are coconut flavoured.
I'll race you over.
I guess that 'no sugar diet' doesn't seem so smart now Jake.  Excuse me, I'm going for a little swim.
Yes, I'm still having those dentist chair nightmares; why do you ask?
I just hope the rescue pilot isn't halfway through his keto diet.
I told you we shouldn't have eaten those funny mushrooms a moment ago!
Betcha it's a mirage.
My life coach says, " They have what you shouldn't".
You know what that looks like to me? One fuck-ton of carbs.
Sure, it looks great, but tooth decay is its own kind of stranded.
I'm avoiding sugar.
I feel better already.
What, no lollipops.
It's best just to avoid that isle.
But I'm on a Keto diet.
feel free mate ... I'm sugar free.
Don't fall for it. The cholesterol will kill you.
If only it were gluten free...
Islands in the stream...that is what we are... no one in between...
No, you're sweet. That’s just sugar.
No thanks, I’m doing paleo.
I escaped from Carb Island to Keto Island just in time.
Ahhh, No Mate...It's a whale.
I bet those candy canes wouldn't give us as much shade as our palm tree.
Now I know where Fantasy Island is!
No, I am not worried about my dental identification.
The sugar keeps me up all night
This keto diet is a lot harder than I thought.
Well I still think Isle of Desolation sounds more romantic than Candy Beach and I’m not sorry!
We have to consider the glycemic index
It sucks being gluten free
Resist the temptation. You won’t live long if you have too much sugar!
The sea rise from climate change is really bad.  Big Rock Candy Mountain is now Sweets Island.
One of these days I'd like to live on Mirage Island.
Tell me more about this paleo diet.
Nah, it doesn't tempt me; I'm off sugar and gluten.
Kind of ironic since I always got confused as to how many s’s there were in desert and dessert.
Apparently, the underwater giantess could only afford one implant.
Did you consider booking passage on the good ship lollipop?
Dear Mirage, your presence has been dully noted.
We could swim the 1/4 miles through shark-infested waters only to find out it's a mirage, but that's not my concern, what if there isn't any Tums?
Do you think they're gluten free?
When I was your age, my mirages were also less about beer and bikinis and more about cakes and candy.
Look on the bright side, diabetes won’t be an issue
Stay strong man.  Paleo diet.
Do you think they have free dental care?
That desserted island looks nice, but think of the calories.
I found it on Zillow.
I know.  Will we have the ever muster the willpower to wait 30 minutes before swimming back?
Go ahead, I'm off sugar.
I'm on a diet myself.
Are you sure it's vegan?
Wow!  It looks like Julia Childs has taken her Floating Island Dessert to the next level!
Naugh...... I’m afraid of what it will do to my complexion.
What a week to give up sweets.
I was hoping for something a little more healthy.
Sweets without coffee always turns me off.
What's eating at you?
And me on a diet!
Along the waterline; those are macaroons on a dessert island...
I certainly did not realize how far sharks had evolved!
Those humans do look delish.
No dessert for you!
I was the Captain on the Good Ship..........
Where are the women?
So salt with sweet is a must-have for me!
But I’m gluten free.
Screw that, we should have followed the leprechaun.
It’s actually a net negative for calories
I don’t want to play Candyland; I want to go home.
I’ll bet you anything they don’t have prime rib.
So now we’re tied in Candyland.
It's Mediterranean. No carbs, no sugars....
you'll thank me later.
But is it gluten free?
...tempting,but Amazon has lost my electric tooth brush order.
I can't figure if it's a mirage or some kind of flying saucer with a sweet tooth.
At leasr we've got vegan options.
What, you couldn't ask for delivery by drone?
I wonder if any restaurants on that island have desert menus.
Too bad I can't swim.
The grass is always greener.
Have you ever wanted to do it while rolling around in a cherry pie?
You go ahead. I have up sweets for lent.
Explain again why you never want the highest valued island in the neighborhood.
Well I feel lucky - my doctor told me to cut down on sugar.
You go... I'am off sweets !
You can swim over there alone bro, I’m not ruining my keto diet.
Rats, I told you we should have given up wine not sugar for lent.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. Why do you ask?
Right, but you can always come up with some excuse to stray from the paleo diet. Excuses are the language of the unmotivated, Bill.
Looks like we missed the Good Shop Lollypop!
I think that one's for castaways of the Good Ship Lollipop.
The swim allows me to maintain this figure.
It was part of Disney land, but folks said it wasn't worth the ferry ride.
Almost makes you regret going low-carb, eh?
Nice, but I'm on a low carb diet.
And they say they have it bad.
Candyland is just a short swim -- and possibly a submerged shark -- away.
WE just need a few shark fins to add to the a-lure.
Are mirages common out here?
I'm sorry, but it was dark, and they both had only one 's' on the map!
You say Keto, I say Sweeto.
And thus îles flottante was created.
Yeah, but is it gluten-free, dude?
I'm allergic to gluten
It’s a sugar coated mirage!
Well at least were not part of the obesity epidemic.
Unfortunately I am on a low sugar diet
'I'm sorry, Hansel. I don't think Gretel is coming back."
Don Urbanus, Valley Springs, C
I'm watching my carbohydrates.
I can't tell which is the worst decision - going keto or jumping off the cruise ship.
Busy Season...temptation island. At least I won’t gain 69 lbs
I thought Candyland was only a board game.
Looks like 'The Good Ship Lollipop' passed us by. How long have we been on this island? Are you sure that's not a mirage?
I'm pre-diabetic.
I even heard everything is covered by your public medical insurance there...
Hell, I'll risk the sharks if it's gluten-free.
It's where they really  film The British Baking Show
Nah, I'm gluten free
That was my 1990 dream?
Its just your stomach making you see things, a bit of undigested shoe is all.
Oh, man, I can just FEEL my A1C level rising . . .
Do you think there are any Gluten-free options?
So exciting...I smell a TV show...
Damn it, I'm off sweets this week.
No, not Devil’s Island, Willie Wonka is in exile there.
They're the man-eating snacks of Tulare Island.
I know where the kids will go if they make it...
That's so funny, my uncle died of diabetes too!
No, you calm down Carl. Someone is getting a letter from the home owners association.
Dang! I just went Keto.
But what about your Hyperglycaemia?
There is no where to "RUN" or  We will be (EATEN)
The 99% hidden below is actually a man-eating octopus.
Yep. Week 6. Right on schedule. Wait to you see what shows up on Week 10.
I prefer a non-fat, sugar-free, USDA organic survival.
I can't swim. You?"
"Diet
That's Paradise Island.
So anyway this dude asked if I wanted to be in a music video, yeah? Multi-generational indie crossover type thing, Weezer with Iggy Pop and Kate Pierson? So I was like, yeah, man, sounds great. Had no idea they’d be filming it on location.
A part of me is really glad we’re not there because, you know, I’ve been trying this new diet recently...
You go ahead. That stuff goes right to my love handles.
Really?  A mirage in the ocean, are you sure
the food looks better on the other side
I'm on the South Beach Diet no can do.
Just as well. The dentist's bills were killing me.
It's a leftover set from "Diabetic Survivor."
Not Every Island has a Disney Land Nearby.
Head for the island with the sweet coconuts, you said
That island might look sweet but its really just an illusion
If we weren't diabetic, it would be worth swimming over to.
I'm waiting for the 'good ship lollipop' to take me to the 'big rock candy' island.
I told you NOT to book us on a cruise when they are paying us to be the passengers.
Awww, you're the one with the sweet-tooth!
Empty calories! Rock-paper-scissors. Who eats who?
Tell me again about your unmatched navigational skills.
She was a good ship, that Lollipop, but shiver me timbers, ye don’t want to wake up to one of her tummy-aches.
Got an ‘s’?
You can't live on sweets alone.
They said we were going to play Chutes and Ladders.
What's the tip policy here?
If I wasn't doing the Keto thing, I'd definitely be interested.
Have at it...watching my sugar.
I bet they will die of obesity over there.
I don't care if it's real. I'm finally the size I want to be, so we're not touching it.
Yeah, but it's not gluten free.
I'm from Vienna so every mirage looks like cake.
Too bad all our dental equipment went down with the ship.
You know, this Paleo diet just isn’t working for me anymore.
Looks good, but what about the tooth decay & those extra calories!
Oh what I'd give to be on that dessert island.
Dude, no!  No on is going to buy the movie rights to our memoir if we're stranded on a doggone DESSERT island.
I wish they'd fix the bug in this virtual reality Candy Land, I've been stuck in here since I was five.
He always did have a flair for the whimsical.
Any changes in your life?
I remember the day when you could still look up to the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
It's a meringue, m-i-r-a-g-e, meringue.
I’m on a low carb diet.
No tea? How uncivilized. They must be from another planet.
It looks greener to me!
Oddly enough, this just reminds me of how much my Mother always hated Valentine's Day.
Why the cheap candy canes?
I saw this the last time I did Whole30.
I've never had much of a sweet tooth to be honest
And with Insulin Island behind us, we should be able to stay alive for up to a week before dying of dehydration!
Sorry man, i'm lactose intolerant.

How long have you been diabetic?
Hey, no cavities.
Just our luck, and I don't even like coconut.

I heard these are popping up all over.
It’s always greener on the other side!
I don't think it really matters if there's an extra 's' when we're 2,000 miles from anywhere. Besides, it's a mirage.

The candy canes.  I'm gluten-free.

Excellent! With this new diet, it looks like we’re entering the Candyland Dream Phase. This is progress!
I agree, its chef Janine’s work.  I hear she’s opened her own place.
I wouldn't do it.  Sugar is so bad for you.
Carbs to the rescue!
I’m sure they have insulin there too!
I am tired of the same old stuff on Candy island
Too bad they’re not gluten free.
I just wish we would have wordplayed it first.

Yes, I am now sorry I gave up sugar.
They'll eat us if we get too close
And I thought candy crush was hard
So, I was reading palm hearts are in season now.
I'm glad we're here. I could never keep my diet over there.
Too bad my wife just signed me up for whole 30

I'd swim over but I'm on a diet.
A dessert island next to our desert island, and I've got diabetes!

Can't, I'm on a Carb-ibbean free diet.
You were right ... ordering the fresh fruit medley would have absurd.
I’d swim over there, but those Oompa Loompas scare me to death!
I mean I love breasts, but can you imagine...
You go ahead--I'm trying to avoid sugar.
You bet’cha there is going to be a price to pay!
Only if we had a wall
isn't great to get away for a few days?
I shall call you 'Man Cheat-day'.
Sure, but will we be able to make it to Dentist’s Island afterwards?
At least it would be a sweet rescue.

I wish Mikie was here.
I don't man, it looks pretty sweet to me. I say we go for it.
I would rate it somewhere between hula dancers and cannibals.
The carbs, though.
Number one: it's not good for us.  Number two: those sneaky sharks.
If only I was not on this low carb sugar free diet.

Man, did I pick the wrong week to give up carbs?
I’m good... I was never really a sweets kinda guy, you know?
Relax under a palm tree, with unparalleled views sounded much better before we started that sugar detox!
I’m not swimming over there unless I know it’s vegan.
A wall sounds like a great idea.
I prefer the vegetation over there.
I guess the cartographer forgot that ‘desert’ has one ‘s.’
Yes it looks good but your doctor says no sugar
So, where do you wanna go after we leave Whole30 island?
So tempting...but how about our extreme diet???
I agree it looks enticing, but you should know, my dentistry license is not good here.
I'm doing Paleo - too many carbs
Swim for it? What's the point. It's not gluten free.
I'm watching my calories.
Really makes you rethink your commitment to keto, doesn't it?

I’m glad we washed up on a gluten-free island.
I thought getting away from carbs would be the big plus of being marooned
Diet island.
I don’t know, my dentist says I need to lay off the sweets.
Sure, inflatables are easy to store, but their Con Ed bill must be sky-high.
That's exactly why I still have these pearly whites.
You go ahead, I am on a gluten free diet.

Do you think the hens lay soft boiled eggs?
…but it’s a cupcake!”, she exclaimed.

Just hope whoever baked  that doesn’t come back on Atkins, looking for protein.
If you want to eat all that refined sugar - go ahead. I'm staying here.
But are they gluten and dairy free?

This is what being on a keto diet means.
it’s not good for our health anyway...
All those sweets and nothing to wash it down with but saltwater?  No thank you!
It looks inviting, but before getting on our flight, my doctor said I needed to start watching my cholesterol.
Naw, I don’t have a toothbrush.
What happened to the good ship "Lollipop"?
Do you think it's a mirage, or Mar-A-Lago?
Don't even think about it; your cholesterol is high enough

as it is!
I would...but it's not Keto.
It's too bad I'm low-carb, eh?
I knew I should have played more Candyland as a kid.
I bet there's food over there.
Your first wish should have been to speak the same language as your wish-granting genie
I'm off sugar, how about you?
I'M not gonna say it...YOU say it.
The keto diet isn't all it's cracked up to be anyway.
You go ahead, I'm on a Keto diet right now.
My stomach tells me to swim to the sweet side.
What makes you so sure we're not on Candy Island?
I wish I'd picked a different month to go low-carb.
You go ahead. I'm on Atkins.

This island is one S away from diabetes.
No, I have zero interest in playing Candyland.
Don't forget, the grass is always sweeter...
I don’t know...maybe the candy canes are gluten-free.
Glad we’re not stuck on that island – gluten makes me gassy.
At least we have some shade!
The say sugar will kill you.
Little did they know it was a whale.
I'm keto so I don't think it would be worth the swim.
You see a rescue ship right? Not exactly.
Yeah, but think of the calories?
I got tired of playing Candy Land with my daughter every day, so I decided to make it more interesting...Unfortunately they love it even more...
On the Good Ship Lollipop
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay
Just my luck, sugar and empty carbs!
I'd bring a spoon
We've waited a loooong time for dessert!
I always loved playing Candyland.
This is nothing. Last year I did Whole30!
My sweet tooth is killing me.
I thought dessert always came after dinner
No processed palm oil on OUR island.
I picked the wrong month to give up sweets.
Actually, I found the lesson on "ascent" and "assent" at Mt. Everest much more challenging.
Don't tell me about your mirage...plus, I'm on a diet!
Look on the bright side. This cleanse would be much tougher over there.
The Good Ship Lollipop is on the way.
so , do you think we should break our diets?
I'm so glad to hear that you won't misspell desserted next time.
Satan's place. Sand is hotter than Hell. Year round too.
Too bad I am on a low glutton diet. But why don't you go ahead.
I'm feeling like it might be time to go off my Keto diet.
Are we allowed to have dessert before our main course?
Man I was thinking of the other kind of des(s)ert
Yeah, that makes sense.
... And our cholesterol levels would be through the roof.
Look, the Goodship Lollypop is finally here!
Big Rock Candy Mountain, redux
But I can’t swim! You dog paddle and get me those cookies.
I won't make the same mistake again.
Well for sure I'm re-evaluating my paleo diet.
WOW, the good ship loly pop!
The Good Ship Lollipop, HAH!
I'll wait for the savouries.
Maybe this was a bad time to try Whole 30.
I think I need my medication.
Eat your heart out!
Well, this is one way to guarantee a sugar free diet.
Want to see who gets there first?
Your right, you promised me a secluded tropical island
vacation ........ not Candy-land.
*Mirage carbs or mirage calories. You can't have both."
You're right, it does look better from back here
Just as well. I'm gluten free.
Stay with me or go for the sweets--it's a false choice, really.
The good news is, I'm on a diet.
I hear when you get up close it’s a little bit off-putting.
They call it "Paradise Island."
I bet they envy our Paleolithic diet.
I don't swim.
Looks tempting,but it just not part of  my Paleo diet.
I'm waiting for some gluten free options.
But it's not paleo or gluten-free.
Where do you think the gluten-free island is?
Are you hungry?
It’s either a mirage, or there’s a big baker somewhere.
Too bad I’m on a gluten-free diet.
I would if my A1C wasn’t so high
Not for me I’m watching my weight.
You may feel great at first, but then—the carb crash.  Plus, it isn’t gluten-free.
Actually, I really don't yearn to be young again.
Horatio. Darn it!  We go on weight loss retreat  and that Abu Dhabi food barge just won't leave us alone.
I bet Fred's the donut.
That mirage wouldn't bother you if you were doing Paleo.
Not on my watch.
Must be the Candyland Expansion.
I don't really have a sweet tooth.
I wish your spelling was not that good
Big deal—I'm gluten free anyway
lets visit the island across the way, wouldn't that be sweet?
You should have let me roll the dice.
30 days on Keto Island should do the trick.
It's times like this that I wish I wasn't on my diet.
Could we contact the travel company for a room upgrade honey ?
Say, why don't we swim over to that island? It's filled with enormous candy and pastries, while this one lacks food alltogether. By the way, have you ever noticed that the words "desert" and "dessert" are only one letter apart?
Is that on the Keto Diet?
Pity I gave up carbs and sugar.
No! Our cholesterol will spike.
I don't see it- but I am getting tired of coconuts.
Gosh darn it Kyle! I though you said Desert.
I wish the sharks would go away!

Didn't I see an ice cold milk ferry pass us a few minutes ago?
You contemplating "your just deserts?"
Oh, my, it's the good ship Sugar Shop!
Do you think we have a good enough reason not to play Candyland?
To me, it still looks like a pile of junk. On the other hand, you no longer resemble a dead bush. So I guess on some level this has been a pretty good vacation for both of us.
Boy, weight watchers has really gone too far this time!
Better not try it.  I understand the sharks have a sweet tooth.
Okay, so it's an illusion that in our shared delusion is real?
So you really are a diabetic?
I’m sure they have a gluten-free option.
I think of it as "deserted" with one "s."  At least here we have each other.
Sea mirage you say and here I thought it was from our sunken shipment of pool toys
No, it’s just another cruise ship!
Yep, we should have listened to our mom's and taken swimming lessons...
Lets pass on the a mirage a la carte.
Want to go for a swim ?
I picked the wrong day to start this diet.
I think it's Putin's "Good Ship Lollipop" trolling for Trump votes in 2020,
That sucks. I just started my Keto diet.

How come we don't have any of that on the South Beach?
Vegan's Paradise
Are there sharks on the way to Candyland?
Candyland is my favorite game
But think about how many calories we’re saving
I know it looks tempting, but I’m trying to cut down on sweets.
And I thought "Candy Land" was just a board game!
So close yet so far away.
As a dessert, the floating island is just not that satisfying.
Looks good, but it will be bad for our teeth.
I gave up sugar for the new year.
Eh, I think their original location is better.
That's Selma and Jack over there.They won the Grand Prize on one of those TV quiz shows.

I guess the grass is always greener......
No thanks, I'm done with that yo-yo diet craze.
C'mon. I need a donut.
Not if it has gluten
I told you to proof read before this story went to print!"

Nah. I'm on a low glycemic regimen.
Let’s put our flag on those candy canes!
I see why Columbus bypassed this deserted island to sail to that desert-ed island
Yes, I still stand by my "desert island book" choice.
I was never much for sweets, I'm more of a salty guy.
Every sweet tooth is an island unto itself.
Believe me, it’s a lure.
It was very nice, but the dentist bills were killing us.
If only I weren't paleo.
Gluten, dairy, sugar, NO WAY!
So how will you know when your sugar levels get low?
See, looking at it doesn't add calories.
Dang, we con't post a picture of that.
I would swim over there but I just started my new Keto diet.
Ignore it. It's new WW tempt! I have 5lbs to go.
It may seem risky now but trust me, that place was loaded with triglycerides.
These are the moments I wish I knew how to swim.
I left off the "S" for savings.
Doesn't look gluten-free anyway.
I think you are seeing a mirage!
Feb 13th....
It's not or never. After tomorrow it goes back under the sea for a thousand years.
Tempting, but I gotta pass. I'm on Whole 30.
Those dolphins out there look like candy canes and cupcakes.
"Let's go see if it sparks our bliss."
We should probably stop talking about food so loudly, whenever the sharks are present.
Relax, my clients swear by the Isle of Candy hypnotherapy.
Think I'm going to stick with this no carbs diet.
I have diabetes anyway.
What's that saying about "always greener on the other side?"  No truer words eh?
Not a single thing on my diet.
Too bad you can't swim and I'm on the keto diet
You were right, it's spelled with two esses.
Nah, we would only get cavities, and there is no dentist here.
Wanna go halfsies on the palm tree?
I swear, before global waming there was nothing but a wall between us.
I'm glad we are on a sugar free diet
Let's jump on the Good Ship Lollipop!
Don't know about you, but I'm watching my weight.
You still think it's a mirage?!
It isn’t inappropriate. We were on the good ship Lollypop.
So this is why they asked on the diet-program-application if we'd ever had swim lessons.
I thought this diet would be harder.
Good thing I'm a vegan.
Think of all the keytones we're burning.
Another sign of Global Warming, or the Coast Guard has one hell of a sweet tooth!
How many 'esses' do you spell that with?
I'm supposed to watch my sugar levels.
The problem is once you have sugar you start craving it.
I think I am having a dejà vu, George.
But you promised me you'd go gluten free this year

I miss Candy Crush - I wish I didn't lose my phone.
It's either starvation or diabetes ... never a joy in life.
Are you sure the "Use By date" is not over?
Ya, but what about your A1C levels?
Wrong again. The double-s is in dessert, not desert. Let's go for double or nothing: Doughnut? or do-nut?
Must be one of those quantum fluctuations.
I wouldn't.  We'd only put on weight.
I've only ever been here before on the keto diet.
Is it one "S" or two?  Boy, I could kill for a dictionary right now.
Frankly, it's not worth the diabetes.
The best thing with the Paleo diet is just to put sugar and carbs right out of your mind...

Sweet, you stranded us on the wrong dessert-ed island.
'Hey Timmy, good thing i'm diabetic!"
You wanted to go keto..

Well, I don't see any Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Too bad I'm still on the keto diet.

I am not swimming over to “Candy Island”
I booked for "deserted" islands, but I guess my spell check turned it into a "desert" island.
Ugh Jayne, do you see that island too?
Nah, I rather have bugs
I don't know what to think.  The last giant hotdog I met wouldn't admit it was a hotdog either.
Did I tell you I was a vegan?
It's too bad we crashed next to Candy Island.  I'm watching my carbs this week.
I don5 know about you, but I see Candyland
I told you this keto diet works.
I am finally losing weight!
I told you being vegan wasn't the best idea
Or maybe we’re just seeing the bald spot on top of the Candyland Sea Monster?
I would so rule that island.  I have that app on my phone.
I always knew my lack of spelling skills would come back to haunt me. Two island choices and I forgot an “s.”
Do you think anything over there is Whole30?
It's much easier keeping keto over here.
Look Herv’e, it’s Fantasy Island!
You can go for it but I’ve just gone Paleo.
I'm going to paddle on our palm fronds 
I'll send what's left back on the cupcake boat.
You swim for it. I'm a diabetic.
I think it’s real but I try to avoid carbs.
If I hadn't lost my insulin pump when the ship went down, I would definitely swim over there.
I know we haven’t eaten in a week but my nutritionist has me on a sugarless diet.
I'd still rather get the full experience.
Candy Cane, Cupcake and...Strawberry Cheesecake. What about you?

We certainly will live longer on this island with our healthy vegetative food.
Big rock candy island—bad for your teeth.
That's the Swiss Family Robinson island.
Whatever happened with you and Rhonda.
Darn...this is the week I have gone keto and sworn off of sugar.
I thought we were giving up sugar.
It's definitely a mirage, right?
So you had to anger the captain of an alien spaceship.
I'm sick of coconuts, too, but with our luck, we'll have to swim through shark infested waters to find out they're either not gluten-free or a mirage.
I bet the hens lay soft boiled eggs
It's a pity we're diabetic.
They would have outnumbered us 2 to 1 if it weren't for diabetes.
I’d swim there but I’m doing Whole 30
I preyed to god for water,girls and food. Why would he send the good ship lollipop

Being diabetic, I’m happy where I am.
Did you know, Fred, that readers of The New Yorker, when they're tired, hungry, and thirsty, have been know to project comical scenes into cartoons?
It's really tempting, but I'm gluten intolerant.
Darn it. I'm off sugars!
Sorry,  I’m. Gluten. Free
I swear I saw coconuts.
Is it eye candy or cavities?
I'm more of a chocolate cake guy.
Did you just say you are on the keto diet?
Sorry, I have diabetes...
I DON'T SEE A LOW FAT SMOOTHY ON THAT ISLAND.
Stop worrying about calories.  The swim there and back will take care of that problem.
You'll deserve a treat if the sharks don't get you!
Yes, but will we find dental floss?
We discovered it, so we get to name it. And “Candy Land” is a great name, but we’d never get it by the Hasbro copyright lawyers.
What do we do now for fun?
My dentist insisted it was the best charter available.
I’ve heard that’s where Katy Perry filmed one of her music videos.
I think it's a Fataning Morgana.
I never expected Candy Land to get an Xtreme version.
Its only a damn illusion.
Well, I am guessing Oompa Loompas forgot about us!

That one is spelled with 2 "s"s.
It's too bad Oompa Loompas are hostile in real life
So, among other problems, you obviously don’t know a trochee from an iamb.

mirages around here make my fillings ache.
Yeah, but as far as mirages go, I prefer mine in Technicolor.
Just look at all that added sugar! We are so lucky to not be marooned on that island!
Actually there's a surprising amount of snakes.
Gee whiz, just think how easy Candy Land was to play as a kid.

I think we're going to need a longer candy cane.
Martha Stewart to the rescue!

I forgot my dice.
No thanks,my diet emphasizes portion control
Ask not whether the big rock candy mountain can come to you but whether you can come to the big rock candy mountain.

But my blood sugar!
You go ahead, I just hate that sugar crash.
I say the grass isn't always greener...
Deserted. Dessert.  Who cares what kind of an island it is? Besides, I forgot my insulin.
Don't be a fool, you'll rot your teeth.
I wish the sharks had a sweet tooth. We might negotiate a deal.
I was wondering why water does't taste salty today.

Thanks for the Valentine's gift - but where are the truffles?
You go, I’m type 2 diabetic and gluten intolerant.
I hate them. They've all got iPads of their own, and we're still stuck sharing the goddam Palm.
I thought this "dessert" only happened in the desert.
It's no Big Rock Candy Mountain.
I find that this is the only way to stick to Whole 30.
Don't even think about it. There's definitely an ogre over there. I just hope he can't swim.
You never heard of fantasy island mirages?
I'm waiting for the Good Ship Lollipop
I don’t know. I’m in a diet.
Yes, the paleo diet can be challenging.
Airbnb?
My dentist says all those sweets are bad for me.
Yes, but is it paleo?
I would suggest we hitch a ride with them, but my blood sugar is too high.
Power of  positive thinking dessert island does sound better 
Frank Buckley Andover, MA
The candyman can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
You can go ahead, but I'm on strict keto.
But there's no escape from carbohydrate island!
Candyland  Island is in my five year plan.
I need to know if its gluten free before I'll swim over
The pilot of Toddlers in Paradise was here but never got off the ground.
I never knew Wayne Thiebaud lived in this neighborhood.
When did you say it was Easter, exactly?
That makes sense:
Miracle-gro for the soil,
Sharks to keep the kids out.
You can swim over there if you want but would your dentist approve?
Our coconuts are vegan!
You know, historically, Candyland was designed to distract people from lonely times like these...
At least we don't have to eat that stuff.
If only we weren’t doing Whole 30.
It's a "Welcome Home" party just waiting for us to swim back over there.
But ours is Keto-friendly...
Hmmm I think we should have gone over there.
Do you think that doughnut is gluten free?
It’s definitely tempting, but I don’t want to risk getting cavities.
You go ahead. I'm holding out for Candy Land.
Ever since we moved to this side of the island, I’ve sensed your FOMO increasing.
Think we can sprint over before that great white gets back? Or do you think it's a plant??
No, I've never considered myself eclair-ish.  Why?
For girls maybe, but not for candy.  Anyway, we've got shade!
I'd give my eyetooth to be on that island.
I can't eat any of that. I' on a low-carb, sugar-free, and gluten-free diet.
I would, but I'm doing the Whole30 this month.
They say sugar is the new salt, so I'm staying far away
No, Dave, I don’t think it’s gluten-free.
It’d take a Trump to keep up with those Joneses.
Just my luck. My cheat day isn’t until tomorrow.
I could really go for some insulin right about now.
Do we have enough left for the entrance fee?
I wonder if they have any croissant? Yeah, I really have missed my morning croissant.
Sorry, but I have just mastered my diabetes and I don't want to undo that.
I knew we should have gone with the North Beach Diet.
That's going to play havoc with my paleo diet.
Once you eliminate sugar from your diet, you no longer crave it.
...but no taffy?
'There is another word besides mirage to describe that but I just can't think of it."
Go ahead, I'm 100% Keto.
I should have packed an extra S.
Small Rock Candy Island
- look, they have cool things on the other side.
- let's take over.
Marketing directors know no bounds.
Let's go for it. I'm starved
Trust me, we're way better off over here on Diabetes Island.
Those candy canes are probably gluten-free, right?
We're looking at the Island of Lost Joys.
I guess we could have gone somewhere a little more sweet.
I tried Paleo and Keto, but I need something more restrictive.
I can't, I'm off carbs.
It's times like these I wish I wasn't so committed to my gluten free lifestyle.
Looks like we did it.  We turned Manhattan into an isle of joy.
Do you think my Doc would be unhappy if I indulged?
Yes, but are they gluten free?
No, I didn't like the movie, and I don't know the words to that song.
I'm watching my weight
It’s because you can’t be 20 on Sugar Island . . .
But I told my Twitter followers that I wasn't going to eat sugar this month...
It's not the sharks that keep me from swimming over. It's what that stuff will do to me from the inside if I swim over.
When the captain put us ashore he said,"No forgiveness for your sins, therefore you shall suffer forever."
Ok, I’ll take the doughnut.....but you keep the complete works
Yeah, more empty carbs.
Here we are castaways, but on that exclusive Republican island, they are 'naufragé'.
The Baker is always better on the other side of the Moat
It's just not appealing.  I'm on a diet.
Pick your poison - grains or sugar.
Now that's what I call a true deserted island!

Peter Giessner, Peapack NJ
I think we should stick with the coconuts; they have fewer calories.
Your nose grows every time you tell me you don't want it.
Enjoy — you could die of sun stroke tomorrow.
I'm on the Sugar Detox Diet.
Let’s see the bright side: the money spent on dietologist won’t be wasted.
Whatever you may think it is
Can you swim? I can't...
I thought you ordered the gluten-free dessert.
Don't even think about it.  You're on low-carb.
Think of it as one in the eye to the surgeon general
You don't think so huh? Haven't you've heard of pool sharks,loan sharks....hellooooo!!
I can't believe you lost the double purple card.
But where are the coconuts?
Every Dieter's MIRAGE
...Someone wrote "HELP 911" on the island behind us...You think that's the WiFi password?
It will probably be too crowded. Let’s wait for the candy canes to melt.
Hmm, sweet or salty
No,not this one. It's a toxic sub in disguise.
Not for me, buddy. Sugar causes cavities.
They show up every couple of years wanting to lure me off to Candyland.
So... are you afraid of sharks?
Nah...I’m vegan.
We don't qualify.  They're looking for kids.
Alright! I agree ! We should have brought "Chutes and Ladders" instead of checkers.
Trust me, with all the FODMAPs in that stuff, we're better off without it.
I'm on Keto, so let's keep this just between us.
It's where Little Rocket Man tamed 
the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.
No, we are doing the Whole 30
Here we are deserted and just desserts?
If we book our flights now we will be able to afford the extra leg room fee.
This diet plan is the best ever!
Nothing like it back home, wouldn’t you say?
If only it was sugar-free
I say we stay here. All that sugar would be bad for our health.
Mirages only come out in deserts, Baby Brother; this one is for real, trust me!
I picked a bad time to go keto.
You were unconscious and I'm on a diet.
I made that mistake all the time as a kid.
I literally just started keto.
I thought about it, but the doc told me to lay off the sweets.
Now that is the REAL “ “Temptation Island”.
/s/7037adb77c53bda78d7c5a93d95b3af9/a2bb15b3-65f9-42e4-b21e-37336dc3
I actually lost all my teeth.
I would go get that donut, but it's not on my diet.
Nope, I can't take gluten either......
Good thing we are resetting our metabolism otherwise we 'd have to   figure out how to get those sugary sweets.
I'd like to buy an S - ???
Do you think that 10,000 strokes would cover it?
Too bad about the sharks in these waters.
I wanted to surprise you with a cruise on "The Good Ship Lollipop."
I think I will just skip dessert.
Ah yes, the Nestle portion of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
Sweet are the uses of adversity...but do they deliver?
But if I stay here it will be easier to stick to my low carb diet
We knew there would be lots of temptations when we started the Keto diet.
Let me guess... You also failed Capt. Hooks spelling bee.
Hmm ... I always thought Candyland was a Board Game.
If you had your Candyland game we could get there!
I heard sugar isn't good for you.
Go on over, I'm diabetic.
No way! I gave up carbs and sugar.
All we need now are some good books to enjoy the dessert island.
I’ll have some if you have some.
Remember that game.
That's Sammy Davis's old pad. If we make it, what kind of candy do yo want?
Behold the Island of Misfit Calories!
I think it is your turn to grab the cake, after all you were the one on swim team
Mine was not a low-sugar cruise ship
Hey man, as tempting as it is, I'm staying committed to this 'Keto' thing
The sea does seem blue-er over there
Now there's an island that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you can sleep out every night
A mirage I tell you, vortex refractions from the mainland's gluten and corn syrup runoff
Tasty Treat Island? Really? Two years with nothing else to look at and that’s the best you could come up with? Can we never speak of this again?
How's your A1-C numbers?
Sometimes, it feels like it would’ve been better to be part of a cosmic typo.
The sturgeon sent it...they're trying to tempt us off caviar.
Sorry, I'm a borderline diabetic.
Thanks a lot, 
ya led us not into tempation !
but delivered us from evil -
for there is the kingdom
of cane and cake, and gone for ever.
NO! It is too many calories for our jog.
What's the,point of a gluten free person swimming to an island full of cake?  Well first, that giant strawberry is gluten free, and second eating it wiill hold off the scurvy if you value your smile, dude!
Oh darling,if only we lived there,we could play Candy Land all day long!
I should have specified we wanted to be over their when I wrote the genie.
Ya, but your body doesn't actually need the carbs...
I'm in the intermittent fasting diet.
Ugh, all we have on this island is chocolate-less mounds
Are we in the middle of some gigantic porn movie?
I kind of hope the straws don't spoil the sunset.
Islanders 4 Canes 2 on the Food Channel.
I would think we could loose a few pounds on this diet!
That's what they taught us in school!
Survivor Pastry Chef Diet Temptation Island: 
Desert vs. Dessert
Binge Now or Starve!
This is still a good thing—at least we’re surrounded by anticavity protection.
Must be a mirage. It was Candyland, not CandyIsland"
Reminds me of that board game Candyland
Yes, it is tempting; but, I don't trust those candy canes.
We could swim over but what's for lunch?
Wow! I thought Shirley Temple gave up singing "The Good Ship Lollipop"!
Do you want to at least sing Cake By The Ocean
To survive we must take a dive.
Desert, Dessert, and island is an island.
I'm on this new ketogenic diet so I'm going to have to pass.
How long have you been doing Keto?
I'm a diabetic.
Good, because I want the donut.
Hey, it's garbage island.
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
When my options get smaller, my dreams become bigger!
I figure all I have to do is swim, swim, swim as fast as I can
Now, aren’t you glad i startednus on the paleo diet?
Too bad I’m off sugar this month
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey . . . I think there's a song in that.
If only we had whip cream.
We shouldn’t have played chutes and ladders
Not for me thanks, I’m on a detox.
I'd swim over there, but I'll be darned if I didn't just start my diet.
It'd just a mirage.
I don’t think I need to sugarcoat it; that dessert-ed island looks so sweet!
Dental license up to date?
I bet you're really happy now that we became vegetarians ?
Too bad about the sharks. Humm,I think I can swim faster than you. Let's go for it!
Too bad I’m on a diet.
I lost my insulin
Too bad I'm on a low-carb diet.
It's the sequel to the game, Candyland.  It's Dessertland!
And this is why we must tax the ultra-sweet.
Are you still recommending the Paleo diet?
Of course the one tree on our island has no coconuts!
I'd love to try buy I am gluten intolerant.
Candyland: so near rand yet so far!
I'd swim for it except I'm watching my weight.
LOOK-it's Candy Land !  No it's all in your mind. Well .....good thing my mouth is not in my mind!
Should I cheat on my Paleo diet?
Sour grapes” if you ask me
Sure, they're simple carbs, but I think that our abs will still shred if we swim over there.
Too bad we are on a gluten free diet.
You go ahead, I’m on a low cholesterol diet.
My mistake, I didn't realize the Candy Land Cruise would actually be piloted by desserts
I don't know about you, but I'd rather be gluten-free
Just like they have been saying, that fentenyl stuff is really dangerous!
We're on a Sugar Detox, we'll wait for the next one!!!!!
When it rains, it pours.
It's tempting, but I'm trying to avoid the Freshman 15.
IF YOU REMOVE THE CANDY COATING WE'RE ALREADY THERE.
Originally I liked that we were being more real.
 Now, I just want to get my hands on that candy cane.
No, it’s no mirage...those are some leftovers from a “party boat” !
We should probably just swim over there.
I told you to sing the "Big Rock Candy Mountain" instead of "Michael Row the Boat Ashore"!
I wish I had learned to eat gluten as a kid.
Diabetes can cause the strangest hallucinations.
Too many carbs.
Do you know how many calories are in that?
Can't swim? I'll toss you a candy cane!
Tell me again about the keto diet.
If only one of us could doggy-paddle.
But is it gluten, nut and dairy free?
I'd swim over there with you but last week my doctor told me I have diabetes, so I'd better not...
This is the week 1 mirage on he Keto diet, just wait for week two.
That's fine. I'm off refined sugar these days.
Total carbs. I say we don't. \
You know what they say. The candy is always sweeter on the other island...or wherever you aren't.
I think it's called a Willy Wonka mirage.
I knew the paleo diet would be the death of me.
Let's stay here. None of that looks Keto-friendly.
It's fake, from a candy store display window.  The real stuff would have dissolved in the last rain storm.
I'd go, but lately I'm trying to be more mindful about eating clean.
If there was only a "Weight Watchers" nearby...
Happy Valentine’s Day, Lois. Baked in a nut-free kitchen, so no worries at all.
Yes, it is tempting but, one foot on the island, one bite and I won't be  able to stop until we have to rename it Hog Island.
Sure, I'd love to go to Big Rock Candy Island, but my therapist says I have an imaginary cavity.
I don’t really have much of a sweet tooth....
I’m still not sure if I believe in global warming, we still have a North Pole after all
I wonder if that gumdrop path could lead us out of here?
online baking?
I'm doing Whole 30
All that gluten, carelessly dumped into the ocean.
That one's more of a "sometimes-island."
I say let's make a break for it, before it gets any closer.
What's your issue with Whole30? It feels so natural to me...
This is exactly how I imagined it would be!
Wa-ter you waiting for...Gary?
Alien submersible or hallucination, my sweet tooth still needs satisfying.
Don't even give them the satisfaction of looking.  It's ""Candy Land South Pacific" and the joke is - nothing's edible."
You go. My A1c number is getting up there.
Yeah sorry this island had no gluten-free options
I'm starting to like this reboot of Castaway.
We will renovate the kitchen this summer, I promise.
No, you have to go back for the mugs.
Is it bigger than a bread box?
I always wonder what new people are going to get pissed off at me about
I thought the E.U was trying to discourage us.
It's not real just like the Green New Deal just a fantasy a delusion of fools"
The deserted island is always sweeter on the other side...
Maybe we should try the flare gun.
I told them to send a sugar free, gluten free island!
Gilligan and the Skipper must have dropped us off at Sweat Island instead of Sweet Island. Oh well, at least they’ll be back in a few hours.
Dame this health craze
Damn, and I swore off sweets last week!
You said you wanted to cut-back on sugar anyway.
Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"

hahaha très drôl
I hope you're not thinking of going off  your diet.
I’m holding out until the desserted island has pie.
Do you think the sweets are worth the swim?
No, you go.  I'm on the keto diet.
Trust me, that island is overrated & oversugared!
I'm on the 365-Day No Sugar Challenge.
You go ahead.  I’ve just never liked sweets very much.
The mirage and myth of carb island !
If I hadn't been born in the 21st century I might consider swimming the 20 yards....
I heard it’s all coconut flavored.  And the sugar will rot your teeth.
Is it end of year already?
If we swim over there and indulge, we may turn into donkeys!
YOU can try and swim for it; I’ve finally achieved ketosis!
Bored
Just a warning. She’s got a helluva sweet tooth.
Maybe if we thought of ours as spearmint
You wanna bet?
PGlobal warming...used to be The Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Hey, maybe we could float home on those two candy canes.
Well, there are some nice things about being stranded on a desert island, too.
I think they call it marriage.
Race you.....diet starts tomorrow!
Candyland was always just out of reach for me....how about you?
Do you think they'll notice we're a trap?
I picked the wrong time to start my ketogenic diet.
It’s a new version of the Sirens in the Odyssey. You know . . . Homer? Sirens who sing and cause sailors to shipwreck and die? Here it’s candy they’re using instead of Sirens. Like in the Odyssey. Of Homer. Sailors will row toward the candy. And die.
This new version of candy land loos challenging
It's the Island of Doctor AOC
Dew hue whish two bee their?
That's Candy Mountain, Charlie.
yeah so i feel like piss is more like cum than poop but cum is more like poop than piss. does that make sense?
Just imagine the cavities.
Man, I wish we had gotten shipwrecked on that island instead.
Where did my guide dog swim off to?
Look at what's due S.
I should listen to mom and take swimming lessons
I told you that the codicil to the perpetuity restriction in mom’s would be a bummer.
The palm tree says this island has more baked goods.
I’m vegan.
Of course, now you tell me you’re going carb free!
But my math teacher is probably there.
It’s the Big Rock Candy Mountain!
Should we save our lives for diabetes?
...the other one is Holiday Island, Arkansas.
He was asked what one thing he’d want on a deserted island, and he said ‘a sweet tooth’
Hey, no matter how you slice it . . . Trump got his wall!
Who knew sharks know how to bake?
Have you Googled anything about sweets recently?
You are not delusional, the little fake island is an attempt by Space Force to disguise a reentry capsule.
You think a Uber work here?
I'm going to pass, trying to cut down on carbs.
I'll take the peppermint. I never eat cheesecake when I'm marooned.
Makes me want to break out into song: on the good ship lollipop....
I told you, I just cant afford the calories on this diet.
Looks like the Blue Apron Keto diet finally got here!
What meringue?
Global warming is wreaking havoc on the palm trees.
I say desserts of deserts
Sweet view package, amirite​?
I’d imagine that’s as nice as The New Yorker automatically keeping you logged-in.
- I don't know... This new diet doesn't convince me.
I know I said I’d give it up for Lent; I’m hungry.
My doctor told me to cut down on sugar.
And if he knows we know?
I would,but sweets without a balanced diet is just not healthy.
You can have it, I'm on Keto anyway...
Good thing we are doing the J-lo diet for 10 days no sugar no carbs
It is a good thing I gave up sugar for Lent.
Dibs on the chocolate cupcake
Let's race over---winner gets all.
Looks like Starbucks abandoned their vegan tofu bakery line
Yes Jim, the paleo diet's going well.
This is how I felt like staying in the desert for 40 days!
Fata Morganas only happen in Deserts
The sugar is always sweeter on the far side of open water.
It’s Dessert Cart Island.
Well, it looks like I picked the wrong week to start a low-carb diet!
Der's gotta be somethin'  in dos damn palm leaves doin' dis to us.
Oh darn.... I meant to make a dentist appointment before I left home!
I'm not sure. Too much gluten,maybe?
it's the only way I can stay keto
It is all fattening and a mirage.
I'm tempted, but...remember the Child Catcher from that old Dick Van Dyke movie?
Those are my top ten desert island empty calories.
I get the cupcake!
I'm just not convinced it's keto-friendly
Peter regretted picking coconuts.
...but Mom said sugar was bad for you
Sugar took her. And now there's us two.
No thanks, man. I'm on Keto.
..but think of the cavities.
Candy Land?  Pick a card.
it’s very nice but where is the pea green boat?
Because the dessert island had trans fats.
Do not even think about it!"
"You will slide under water in this Candy Land game.
I'm going low-carb, so here is actually better.
Last Night only the Periscopes were Visible
It's probably from the floating island of discarded plastic. If it isn't, we don't have any cold milk
Jelly roll gum drop.
I thought the left at rainbow trail took us past the ice cream sea.
Yes, and I won the cupcake making contest last year, too!
It is all fattening foods.
If it's not vegan I won't even touch it.
If it's anything like a jellyfish, we'll have to steer clear of those tentacles.
Is that a groovy lemon pie?  Are you the candyman?
I wouldn't go there if I were you, it's unhealthy.
Too bad I'm off sugar.
Too bad I just started my paleo diet this week.
I hear Shirley Temple had a time share on Peppermint Bay.
I'm not sure this cartoon can handle another punch line!
Am I dreaming or is this just a Whole30 mirage
See, that's how you can remember the spelling. We're on a desert island; that's a dessert island. Double the S because you'd like it to be real.
Temptation Island never looked so sweet
And the great irony is I like the song CAKE BY THE OCEAN.
Why did I wish you on a deserted island?
And you said it wouldn't float!
What's the flavor of elusion?
I think we could swim it.
Dude, I didn’t know human waste was this bad!
Oh you just have to try the Tiramisu !
Should I risk it in these shark-infested waters?
Let it go, Cyrus
My dentist woulsay, stay put
I'm trying to eliminate sugar from my diet.
Well, look at it this way. We won't gain weight.
Dude, I have seen Shark Week before, there is no way I am going to swim out there
It’s a good thing we’re both on the palm oil diet.
I knew we should have spent the extra $500 on our yard
It looks apatizing, but think what it will do to your thighs.
You want the pie or the donut with sprinkles?
You up for tacos?
Ok but don't think that I'm going to share the tree with you.
Do we swim for it or do you think a shark will get us ?
sugar and spice and everything nice...let's stay!
Man!...told you not to exaggerate on radio about kids surviving the crash.
Is this before or after it was recycled?
Wouldn’t you know it. I just got diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes before our cruise.
You know, I thought the Keto Diet would involve more food...
I used to avoid them because of the fat,
but now I know its because of the sugar.
I thought we were playing Candyland I guess not any more
So...why are you gluten free?
I hope my dentist doesn't see this!
If you think that's heaven, I'm fine right here on diet island.
Oooooh you wanted to go to the dessert island? You dumb m*therfucker, you dopey prick, now we're stranded here! I'll make sure you get your just desserts alright! And by that I mean justice hurts, because I'm going to beat the living sh*t out of you!
Our relationship would survive long distance...I’m just not sure it could survive your sugar addiction.
I wonder if they’re keto...
The grass always looks gr...Not now, Alan.
Sure,we agreed Sammy was our cast away artist,but I told you Mr. Bojangles could never make our lives satisfying and delicious.
I said I'd do anything to get away from all that kitsch...
We should avoid junk food anyway...
At least this is better for our diets.
Wanna swim for it?
You know, that’s a younger ship wreck survivor’s island. I’m watching my waistline and sugars...
Did I mention I'm on a diet?
Look away. It's the deprivation diet talking.
I hope they are Vegan.
Well at least we won't get diabetes!
Looks like Wayne Thibaud was on the same ship we were on.
I’m sorry I wasn’t a worse speller
Looks great, but I'm on a diet.
You know sugar is bad for you.
But they’re not gluten-free and have preservatives.
With our luck, they aren't gluten-free.
we're gluten free
Do we have to? I've always hated that game.
Sometimes a sweet islet is just a sweet islet.
Is this Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal?
Just keep thinking of all those carbs, Slim.
Hey Buddy? Yes Pete? You got that $50 I lent you?
Sugarplums? Huh. Must be that low-carb diet you were on.
Let’s stick to tradition
Invest now. Deserted dessert-watchers is the only diet plan that's FDA approved.
I like your mirage better. I see a stack hamburgers and I'm vegan.  
Yeah, well I'm gluten intolerant.
Spotlight, uh; moonlight, uh.
Too bad we didn't rescue our toothbrushes."

"I never believed in all-inclusive-offers for the shipwrecked anyway."
That can’t be good for my diabetes.
But then we'd have to worry about getting cavities.
Too bad I'm on a low-carb, sugar-free diet otherwise I'd swim there.
That explains the drag on that boat
I'd join you, but the keto diet is working for me.
I think it's a Christmas desert tray.
It’s not even real. Neither am I. After the field gets to two dozen losers it’ll be time to wake up, Hillary.
I got some service earlier and checked the lyrics to Nirvana's "Something in the Way." You were right, Kurt says he was living off the "drippings from the ceiling" — not "drippings from the semen." Sorry for making you do that. Plus, look over there!
And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.
Wow, no kidding, I think this is where the witch in Hansel and Gretel ended up?
I’d rather die on this island, than be a sugar addict again.
Too bad that it will not survive global warming!
Man, do you think there's life out there?
I always imagined Sugarland as larger and more appealing.
And how is this supposed to help me go on a diet?
I know it looks real but believe me it is a fake island. OK?
I told you that if I ate gluten something bad would happen.
It's a shame I'm diabetic.
I dreamt of The Good Ship Lollipop.  Poor customer service.
I’m pre-diabetic, so I should really pass on those treats.
Go ahead. I'm a vegan.
I thought the Good Ship Lollipop was just a song, but look at those bon-boys on the peppermint bay.
So, do you think we can make it to dessert island before becoming dinner for a shark?
This would be even more miserable if I wasn't diabetic.
Do you think that's Julia Child's recipe?
I hope those guys have a good dentist.
I guess 'Dessert Island Discs' just didn't have the same ring to it.
Too bad we're both diabetics.
Candy Isle is a myth let's wait for another vessel.
I always wanted to eat my desert or is it dessert first?
Do you think Kilmer could’ve been sitting here when he came up with the line “only God can make a tree?”
I think dyslexia is starting to set in.
But diabetes.
As they say... the sand has better treasure on the other side.
Bro, you never should have candy in the jello mold.
We can make it over there as long as sharks don't like candy.
Without labels, we can’t tell if it's gluten-free.
If only one of us were a dentist...
Got the munchies?
This new keto diet is intense.
Ge, I hope they never build the wall  they keep promising.
A floating UFO from Candyville?
Seems daddy will go great  distances to part us"
As long as it's gluten free, I'll make the swim...
I just can’t derail my keto diet.
Gee I wonder why you chose this island?
The chocolate spread would have made the donut more tempting.
I know! We'll call it Desert Island II!
That mirage you have described sounds real wild.
Candyland did not need to be made more like Jumanji
You go ahead, the shade of a candy cane just doesn't do it for me.
It’s only a mirage!
They used to call it the Candy Mountain roller coaster--there's a steep drop just below the shoreline.
Loaded with gluten!
Wish I wasn't on a 30 day sugarless diet

The candy canes are always greener .......
That's the United Sugar Archetypes. It's very rich, but totally lacking nutritional value.
Did you hear the latest about Trump?
y'know, i think this might be black history month.
That’s how it feels like being diabetic.
It's a mirage,and if it's not,where and the hell am I  going to get a cup of coffee !!
Not just kitschy scuba gear! When it stands up it has terrible coral decay!
Good thing I'm on a diet
And to think last week we found out we have Celiac disease...
Have you ever heard the phrase,"The sand isn't always sweeter?"
I got you babe
Aliens still don't know that we don't eat sugar anymore.
I'm not clear if swimming over there to "Trick or Treat" would benefit us or the sharks.
Take no notice! Circe is up to her usual tricks - she knows you have a sweet tooth, and that the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Ginger Snaps or MaryAnn Cakes?
Sand always looks sweeter on the candy side.
Two words...Swedish. Barracuda.
Nailed it!
Looks good from here, but wait till you have to sign a new lease...
An ice age is bound to come.
I wonder who lives there?  I think it is either Richard Branson or Little Debbie.
When you think about it...its really quite funny to think WE are on Candy Island.
I've always much preferred the simple life myself.
At least we've got no chance of getting diabetes?
I dunno, sugar is so fattening.
There gores the neighborhood
My arrangement of the the new "13th DAY OF CHRISTMAS":  BOXING DAY!!!
Remember, the grass (er, candy) is always greener on the other side.
Sorry, I’m on a low carb diet
Sorry pal, but not with my diabetes.
Your name doesn't happen to be Gretel, doe it?
All we need is a scoop of ice cream with a cherry on top. No nuts required.
We can eat as much as we want over there cause we'll burn off the calories on the swim back!
I hope they are pescetarian.
Its too bad I am on the keto diet...
Hantzel, Gretel, and global warming.
I can't think of any reason. Can you?gj
Just great, even out here,i can't stop thinking about my 400 pound ex wife. I'm having her hallucinations now.
Wonka is escaping the cartel. THAT is as plain vanilla as he gets!
All we get is a palm tree!
They didn't tell us this part of the keto diet.
Tempting? Yes, but at least we can pronounce the names in our ingredients.
Sometimes being on the Keto Diet sucks.
And that’s why you should have gotten a sugar daddy.
To capture humans, the aliens adapted their spacecraft to lure humans to their vessel instead of beaming them up.
This dessert island is a little on the nose.
Just because I chose the low GI option didn't mean I wanted to go completely vegerarian.
I can’t wait ‘ till we are done with this Whole 30 nonsense !
You see that island populated by every girl I had a crush on in school, right?
I'd say the grass is greener, but that candy cane is definitely monochromatic.
You should try those pastries. They're out of this world.
funny, I thought this was candyland!
No thanks, I have a gluten allergy.
Let's get rescued---they may have Oreo's!
Nah, since going Keto I've cut out processed sugar all together. I feel great...hey do you think this tree will ever grow coconuts?
... but virgin coconut oil is so much better for you!
Besides, I’m on that no-sugar diet.
Too bad that these Christmas Islanders are so damn possessive!
Not gluten-free!
Given we are both diabetic, I see this as a diabolical joke from someone who really does not like us!!
If we stay here on our desert island, your bariatric surgery will really pay off. If we swim over to that dessert island you'll  just go back to your old ways. What's it going to be
But if you can wait 3 days the boat will pick you up.
I tried to swim over there once. I was almost eaten by a vermicious knid.
Too bad it’s my detox week
It's called Candyland, where my cruise ship was headed when it went down.
Yes, but carbs...
And it’s not even Thanksgiving yet
Nope, no sharks. 
But, the channel is chock-full of right wingers to keep you from reaching the paradise just a short distance away.
When you said, ‘a deserted island’, I thought you meant, “a
dessert-ed island’.
You know, over there is full of sweets, but since you’re here with me, it makes this deserted island feel much more sweeter...
I'm off sweets m'self.
I booked the tickets during a keto phase.
Trust me, a diet heavy in sugar can kill you.
Darn. If only we had brought our "s".
"Sorry but I'm on a diet"
I think it's a mirage.
It’s not quite what I had in mind when I wished to be on a desert island with an everlasting supply of sweets...
Ist there a line to get in
Anti Atkin propaganda-not falling for it.
Looks to me like too many carbs.
I'm beginning to suspect it's only a Candy Island of the Mind.
But, where would the raised beds for the lavender go? Think about that.
Too bad I'm off carbs this month.
Yeah, but everyone is seriously fat over there."
I believe that's the Good Ship Lollipop. Too bad I 'm on the keto diet.
It must be Christmas and we've been here since 
  Fourth of July
I like to swim there underwater and then pop up with a big silly grin on my face.
The caloric input on that island has sunk many a ship.
Screw the diet! I'm swimming to Candy Island NOW.
Too bad I'm a diet...
Don't worry, everything that grows on Isla Dolce is paleo. You won't gain a pound.
You think those cupcakes are gluten-free?
Hey k'nuckles.  Did you ever wonder if candied island is a mirage?
Of course its a national emergency.  If I eat the food I'll lose the 
weight.  Make America eat great again.  Or was that a gain
I bet my kid would love that.
The food always looks sweeter on the other island.
I would, but I'm doing strict keto.
I wonder if it's the icing on top of a plastic island.
Don't even think about going over there; those deserted desserts are so sweet, they will make you hallucinate for months!
Ah, I remember the  willy wonker movie what is your favourite movie?
When I was a kid, we had to walk this over ice and snow.
This wasn't in the Candy Land vacation brochure!
The Sugarhill Gang
Unluckily, I am on a non-carb diet.
It’s a one-way only trip....there’ll be no coming back!
Yeah but the grass is greener on the other side.
I'd like to but I'm worried about my sugar
I'm allergic to sweets.
This is worse than Tantalus, kid. At least he stays immortal.
At least we are living a healthy life without sugar.
But we don't know how to swim"....
Sunshine, rainbows and lollipops?
That's my mystery.
I would have felt worse if it was gluten free.
Do you think it is gluten-free?
It's the perfect diet plan!
Good thing I'm not a sweet tooth!
I don't know, there's that sugar thing you know...
I've got dibs on the cake!
Don’t be fooled, that’s a German submarine left from W.W. II.
We're either carb-free or we're not.
Let's just swim over!
You think the misfit toys are somewhere around here?
So near and yet so sugary...\`
Well, I've always argued against Globalization. I see this as a test.
I bet none of it's keto, though.
Your speech impediment is playing tricks on you.
I'm not sure where it came from all of a sudden. My mouth is watering just looking at all of that meat.
Sugar is the new Cancer.
this sugar high is making me see things
It's a mirage. Don't bother.
We’ll jeopardize our health if we eat that. Now if it were organic and farm raised...
It looks to good to be true, just like Santa Claus proved out.
That whale has seven blow holes
Would you believe Diabetes?
How’s that diet going?
After reading the Brothers Grimm, the Kraken thought he would try something new
Well,maybe some of the baked stuff is sugar-free,but the canes,never.
It is not a mirage.  That's part of the Green New Deal!
Heh looks like we made the wrong turn
You go ahead, I'm on the keto diet.
My mind is playing a game with me.
Can you see the sugar plum tree....
Stay tuned, we'll be on "Dessert Island Discs" next week.
I think it's a shark illusion.
America is not a meritocracy, and no one should think it is.
In my last job, all I wanted was a wall.
I told you, I’m sticking with paleo if it’s the last thing I ever do.
It's a living!
I say we discard this place and move over there for the “Spark Joy” of it.
Looks like they survived The Caine Mutiny pretty well.
So, what are some, say, swimming distance goals?
My doctor said all the sugar in my diet is going to kill me.
Ship wrecked...on the wrong island.
So you say you have trouble breathing; any other symptoms?
Dude, can you please stop humming Alanis Morissette songs?
I heard it was the set for a Nicki Minaj music video.
That tank top contrasts nicely with those jorts.
I feel like I’m  on the

I shouldn't have taken that painting class from Wayne Thiebaud.
Y’know, as a kid, this game felt easier.”

Barrett Law, Brooklyn, N
Do you have any mints left?
You have got to be kidding.  Instead of a rescue boat, you asked us to be sent the newest router?
It’s the plastic you have to be aware of, not the sharks.
Why is the food on that island so big?
Sure, it's an easy swim over to that desserted island, but we'd sink on the way back.
What do you mean it's not allowed on your diet?
Somehow, I don't really care that the grass is greener on this side anymore.
You said we should cut the sugar, right?
Now's probably a good time to tell you I'm gluten intolerant.
Me neither.
It is a mirage; I don´t see sharks around.
I can't find my passport anywhere.
But there's no drive thru.
Do you think that island has life forms? Oh ! I hope not, they might invade.
Im not saying it’s not a decent opportunity. I’m just sayin it’s not exactly the “Good Ship Lollypop.”
It's a Fat Morgana.
Do you think that the island is inhabited by the witch in Hansel and Gretel? Will we end up like them?
I think you've gone too far with this new diet.
I love you, too, but you still haven't commented on the approaching candy submarine swimming our way.
She told me to go left and now I'm dessert-less with you.
Its not Grenada.  Must be Haight-Ashbury Park.
I bet King Kandy owns it, unless Princess Lolly got it in the divorce.
We may be forced to defend our palm !  This monster, as sweet as it looks,  has huge appetite for coconuts !
Let's race to the land of sweets.
Whoever wins gets to eat.
I find it interesting that in a desperate moment, we're both reverting to a childish fantasy.
Why tempt ourselves with all that gluten?
It's from the first 'land shark-candygram' tests off off off Broadway.
That island is looking like a snack!
Yeah my stomach isn't that big either.
Do you think we can bribe the sharks?
Geez Joe, I told you we shouldn’t have left, you go first.
We may be sick of coconuts now, but after the sugar high there'll be nothing left.
I'd swim over there but the water's pretty frosty."
I TOLD you we should have asked Uncle Milton Bradley for CANDY LAND not STAY ALIVE for Christmas!
Looks like a party to
Me. Yahoo!
I am not swimming to there with you.  I have diabetes.
so does this mean were on alcatraz
Too bad I've given up carbs.
At least we will have low cholesterol.
Go ahead. Enjoy. I never touch sweets.
If we wait long enough, will it float all the way here?
This is going to ruin my diet.
No thanks, I am watching my cholesterol.
If only we landed in the gum trees.
Oh my a new game we can play.
I hope it's all gluten and dairy free, that's what I ordered.
Nah, I’ll pass. Too many carbs...
Am I dreaming of Shirley  Temple?
How's that Whole 30 thing going?
It is a good thing that we know the government's food guide, otherwise it would be a mirage.
Shh.  I think I can hear Shirley Temple sing "On the Good Ship Lollipop!"
Losing at Candyland again!
I told you going into gumdrop forest was a trap!
But do you think it’s all paleo?
You can't eat it. I will just give you more of a sweet tooth.
No, the mental training is exactly why it’s *not* just another fad diet
Like I said, butter, not guns.
I know, my sweet tooth is out of this world.
At least we don't need to worry about diabate.
They're talking to me, for sure...as soon as you get a message we'll go for it.
Looks like they found their "Dessert" island band
Don't fall for it! The only giant candy cane around here is right behind us.
Just my luck I'm diabetic.
I wonder if anything there is gluten-free.
Oasis of the sea.
When I said to aim our flotsam to the right of course I meant that right.
Honee, don't worry, you are sweet enough for me.
Is that really how you want to deal with this diet?
I know it's a mirage, but I am still teetering on diabetic shock.
Feh.  I'd never set foot in that synagogue.
Where’s the Big Rock Candy Mountain?
I hope it's duty free and gluten free!
I’ve been watching my sugar
Unfortunately, they're off my diet.
We can't go over there. I'm on a diet.
That other Island looks sweet and tempting but on the other hand if we go there we'll have no where to sleep!
I would have crashed landed there but...whole 30.
Healthy mind, healthy body. No more junk food!
Is there any easy flight ??
We can eat it all except the Candy Canes which we will use for floats.
Absolutely, it would be be bad for our diet!
I said aavikko.
Doesn’t matter. My cardiologist says that sugar is the worst thing I can eat.
Carl, where’s the chocolate boat?
Tempting, but I'm watching myself.
If a ship passes through, which island do you think they'll choose?
I'd give my left foot to eat that doughnut.
It's a no for me... I'm diabetic.
Did we land on keto island?
"I just don't like that sweet taste in my mouth"
Even if it wasn't a mirage, I'm diabetic.

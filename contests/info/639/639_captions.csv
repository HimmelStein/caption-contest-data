Earl of Cowlick. And you are?
I'm supposed to call my doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours.
So, you're in a tower with no doors; I have a beanstalk growing out of my head. We both lied on our profiles. You wanna go out or not?
We have to move fast.  The king's men are combing the area!
The last princess I rescued was in a well.
Ok, fine, we can make the story about you!
I knew one day my prince would comb.
Ok, fine. Maybe it’s not as thick as I described but your profile wasn’t exactly clear on your living situation either.
The guy took my cow and said to plant the magic beans -- but I had't eaten all day.
Well, then, let yours down and we can tie the knot here.
I'm the Hair apparent
It only does this with you, honest.
The Grimm brothers will be here any minute, so we have to get our story straight.
You spent all those years growing this out when you could have built a ladder in days?
...or, I could come up?
Thank goodness! The last guy who came by couldn't get it up.
Now let me see yours.
Or you could just take the stairs.
I call it hairway to Heaven.
I’m your hairy godfather
I'm pretty sure we're doing this wrong.
Jack said if it lasts for more than five hours, I should call my physician.
Rogaine and Viagra. Why do you ask?
My ex lived in a well.
So many fairy tales get it wrong.
If this lasts more than four hours I'll have to see my doctor.
This really isn't necessary, there's a staircase in the back
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, lower your expectations!
I thought it made me look presidential.
I've used the new viagra pomade, but we've only got four hours to get you down.
It is I, Manbunzel.
Fine. Let’s try it your way.
And yet I can't grow a beard.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, what should I do if this lasts more than four hours?
I'm not sure you understand the gravity of the situation.
Rapunzel, let down your expectations.
In my mind, this was always Plan B.
Rapunzel: the  first draft.
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
It always stiffens up when I'm near you.
It’s been four hours. Should I seek medical attention?
Think of it as Plan B.
Why is everything always a competition with you?
No seriously, let down my hair.
Post haste my princess, I can not keep it up much longer.
Well, that took 30 years but my feet are finally on the ground. You can let go now.
This might work better if we switched places.
It's a Hairway to Heaven
Can you just buzz me in?
Oh, how the fables have turned.
Yes, I’m Repunzel’s son.  Why do you ask?
I feel like you're not meeting me halfway.
This usually doesn't happen, I'm just really excited to see you.
Enough teasing. Come down.
Sorry, I'm a little excited to see you.
Yes, I suppose I could have brought a ladder. What's your point?
Thanks for letting me down gently.
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
If you pull me up, I won't let you down.
What do you mean by "or am I just glad to see you?"
I think we need to read the book again.
Trust me, the alternative is equally Grimm.
I thought maybe you'd had enough let downs.
Wait... let's just savor the irony for a minute.
Wait, I've got a better idea.
Yes, they're extensions.  Quit being a such a princess.
The dispatcher said you were down a well.
Oh, the usual, part it on the left and take 18 feet off the top.
I'm thinking the ladder might have been a better plan.
Rapunzel in Australia.
In hindsight you're right. That's a much better idea.
First you pull me up, then I let you down.
The Viagra went to my head.
I think we are doing this all wrong.
I’ll just take the stairs.
It’s not you Rapunzel, it’s me.
I think you're right. I don't think this is how it's supposed to go. Did you read the whole story or just skim it?
I figured you were tired of being let down.
Okay, here’s where it gets tricky.
Go ahead...the laws of physics havent been discovered yet.
I thought I'd wear it up.
I thought this time, maybe you come to my place.
Up" is the New "Down"
Well yeah, I guess your way might work too.
Oh, there’s a door in the back?
I'm gonna be honest, something about this feels off.
I don't think you know the gravity of this.
Take off about two feet and frost the tips.
This kid named Jack fed me magic beans.
...and so I ate the magic beans.
We do this a little differently in the southern hemisphere.
We really didn't think this out.
Rapunzel, let down my hair!
The fairy godmother said to call if it doesn't go down after 4 hours.
Hurry, before it gets humid.
I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation!
Are you Rapunzel? Or am I Rapunzel?
Okay, Miss Smartypants, YOU come up with an idea.
I've got a bad feeling we're doing this all wrong.
Am I going up or are you coming down?
I’m starting to see the flaw in this plan
Donald courts Melania
You know, I'd really appreciate it if we revisited the ladder idea again.
The real prison is gender roles
If you think that's impressive wait until later tonight!
Ok, so I misunderstood....  I'll go get the ladder.
This is not what I meant when I asked you to reciprocate.
Hurry up! If this thing stays upright for more than four hours, I'll have to go to Emergency!
What do I do? It's been more than four hours
For your information, it's called an updo.
That new Viagra shampoo, is wonderful
I don't know why, but it always seems to do this when I see an attractive woman
I forgot which way the story goes.
Come over? I thought you said “comb-over.”
Sorry, this was the best I could do off the top of my head
It a combination of Viagra and Rogaine!
Ok-so maybe I didn’t completely think this through.
It’s a combination of Rogaine and Viagra.
Look Rapunzel, it's 2018, things are different now.
Careful, they're extensions.
I don't know. I'm a prince, not a physicist.
I guess I don't understand the gravity of the situation...
Leznupar, Leznupar,   pull up my hair.
Stairs? I thought you said hairs!
And then...hold on. I think I have the instructions upside-down.
Yank me up.  It's a new era.
Leznupar, Leznupar - let up your hair!
Gravity won't be explained for another couple hundred years, so just go with it
Rapunzel, you don’t understand the gravity of the situation.
Is that product in your hair or are you just happy to see me?
How drunk were we the night we made this plan?
I thought we were going to your place.
Historians will never get our story right.
My pharmacist accidentally combined my Rogain and Viagra prescriptions.
It's a wig. I got it at Trump University.
Or you could come down?
In hindsight, I guess a ladder is not a bad idea.
Well, I could pull you up, but then where would we be.
I’m not sure we thought this all the way through.
Is that your hair? Or are you just happy to see me?
We really need to get the elevator fixed.
It's called the Trumpunzel.
Think of it as an extensions ladder.
Now what?
The ride down might be little hairy
Didn't you read the story?
Maybe you could just take the stairs.
Look; does it really matter who's hair it is?
I'm not sure I thought this one through.
It's a combover with superglue. Isn't this Trump Tower?
I assure you, I have no problems keeping it up.
Rogaine merged with Viagra
Are we in the right fairy tale?
Do you think I could take the stairs this time?
That's as stiff as if gets.
To be perfectly frank, while the hair extension is very nice, I'd rather the money had been spent on a ladder.
That Rogaine Viagra combo works wonders!
No mousse. I'm just really happy to see you.
Thanks, but I think I'll just use the stairs
It feels good to let my hair up every once in a while.
I hate to rush you, but my family has a history of male pattern baldness.
I was willing to go to any length...
Trust me, I can keep it up.
Wait! I have a better idea.
I think this relationship is headed in the wrong direction.
No, I also have not read the story.
You know there’s a door on the other side, right?
Are you sure you don't want to use the ladder?
I must have mixed some Viagra in with my Rogaine.
Sure, if we do it your way, no one will ever remember my name!
Just take a bit off the top.
We should reread the story before going  through with this.
It's been like this for over 4 hours!  I knew I shouldn't mix Viagra and Rogaine.
The infomercial said it will stay erect for up to 4 hours.
Yes, I am just glad to see you.
We might need to rethink your escape plan.
You’re the one who always wants to try something different.
My therapist said that we should practice some role reversal.
Yes, it's a combover - it that a deal breaker?
Well, do you have a better idea?
Can you take a little off the top?
Harold, I know extensions when I see them.
I wasn’t sure which pill was Propecia and which was Viagra—so I took them both.
I think we're doing this wrong.
Rapunzel Rapunzel not upward I go, Rather you slide down -this is different I know.
Slither to me by descending my doo, We'll run off together and share our shampoo...
Take your time, they promised 12 hours of maximum hold and lasting shine.
Did we get this wrong  Punrazel ?
I accidentally dropped viagra in my shampoo.
I thought I'd move in with you, instead.
Oh wait! I see what we’re doing wrong!
... the last prince with a big comb-over made promises, too!
Yes, sorry, it IS a comb-over.
Keep holding.  Once it sets, we're out of here.
Thank you for letting me down gently
No one said role reversal was going to be easy.
Because I thought you were locked in a dungeon—not a tower.
Yes, it's a toupee, so you may want to take the stairs
Just slide down.
I was thinking tonight we could go to my place.
I think it might be easier if YOU came DOWN!
Won't you consider taking the stairs?
Are you sure this is how the story goes?
What do you mean 'What took me so long?'
Manbunzel, Manbunzel, let up your hair!
I still think my plan was better.
Maybe I should take the stairs.
I'm kind of a bigwig.
What do you mean, "over-compensating"?
It's called an 'updo'.
I'm thinking we should try this the other way around.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my hair.  I promise I'll call!
Let's change some details when we write the book about this.
Someday, Rupunzal, we’ll look back on this and laugh.
Rapunzel, just tie it on to the bedpost and think of it as a zip line
Please, comb down.
I just had the most hair-raising experience!
I knew I didn't understand the story.
I thought maybe it could be my place this time.
I promise if you pull me up, I'm never gonna let you down.
The plan is still a good plan...we just need to tweak a few things.
Did we get it backwards?
You come down? I thought you wanted me to come up.
Why can't you ever just meet me halfway?
But I just don't think "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, pull up my hair" has got the same vibe
Can you find the gum?
It started out as a man bun.
I ate the beans
I think our plan needs a rethink, sweetheart.
What do you mean your mother hates my hair?
I don't respond well to being upbraided.
Don't come down—haven’t you been paying attention to the news?  Pull me up!
Never mind the fable.  Grab my hair and pull me up.
Trust me, it won't let you down.
Manesplaining.
The old way reinforced destructive gender stereotypes.
Don't tease me so.
I don't feel you properly grasp the gravity of the situation.
Grab on and slide down. It'll work because this is a fairy tale."
Keep stroking it just like that and I promise it will stay up.
Just a little off the top."
I'll admit I hadn't really thought this through.
Rejected Early Versions of Classic Fables, # 16: Rapunzel
..but we have a great system now: your hair to climb up and mine to get back down.  Why do you want to complicate things by moving in together?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let go of my hair!
It's down the up haircase - but I know you can do it!
This just feels wrong, somehow.
Tie it to the bedpost.
Didn't you read the script?
You think this is bad? Wait till I take my pants off.
I feel like I can't let my hair down around you.
Now we know what happens when Rogaine and Viagra are mixed.
It's no big deal that you can get it up, Prince. The question is, can you keep it up?
It's now or never, I've got a barber's appointment in an hour.
Um, on second thought, maybe you should just take the stairs down.
Call me old fashioned, but how about you let your hair down.
Better I come to you.
It’s my fairy tail.
I can just take the stairs.
Well you're not what I was expecting either.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your expectations of gender equality!
I know this isn't the way it's supposed to work, but why split hairs.
Well, you did say to comb-up and see you sometime.
Considering the situation, size actually does matter.
Fine, might be a few inches shorter than I said on Tinder.
I still can’t believe you’d let me down like this.
Yeah, I didn’t really think this through...
Thank you, but I'm here about the stairs.
I'm starting to think you're in there for a good reason
I’ve waited five long years to rescue you.
I thought it would be easier if you came down rather than me coming up.
‘‘‘Tis not the only thing that has risen towards thee, my love!”
What do you mean "no"?
You're the only one I can get it up for.
Do you have a better idea?
I mixed Viagra with my hair gel. You should be able to slide right down.
Correct. I don't get the gravity of the situation at all.
I admit, the physics of this probably makes less sense
Can we tell people it was the other way round?
The therapist suggested we try some role reversal exercises.
Mine, yours. Stop splitting hairs and get down here.
Fear not, my princess. It’s a good hair day.
Lather! Rinse! Rappel!
I'd prefer to use the stairs
Just a little off the top, please.
I'm just excited seeing you!
Oh no, wait, YOU should grow the hair.
I prepared for this role for thirty years, and now you’re telling me I misread the script?
They're still out of ladders
Don't overthink it. Just climb down.
What do you mean "you were holding the instructions upside down?'
Your hair looks Grimm.
Rapunzel...rapunzel let go of my hair! She was only a friend...I promise, I swear!
In this story you pull me up and we hide happily ever after.
For some reason I felt like we're doing it wrong
And I thought to myself, why am I always doing the climbing?
Ironic isn't it.
My hairdresser claims it's good  for up to 125 pounds.
When you go low, I go high
Unfortunately, I can't keep it up very long!
Could you take just a little off the top?
Ya know, it might be easier if you just jump.
At first, I did it to flip the narrative on gender stereotypes, but now I'm just enjoying the look.
I don't unwind my knight-bun for just any princess.
Now you show me yours
By extension, I desire thee.
"Comb-over? I thought you said come over!"
Oops, my bad! I thought you asked me to get extensions, not an extension LADDER!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, this ain’t gonna work the way we thought.
Well, mostly it's for cats in trees.
Glad to meet you, Rapunzel.  I'm Prince Rogain.
Leznuper, Leznuper, up hair my let.
I really feel that our relationship is starting to gel.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let up my hair? No, wait, Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let go of my hair? No wait....
I guess we didn't think it through.
Maybe we should take a second and rethink this.
If we want this fairy tale to endure, we've got to come up with something better than, "Ralph, Ralph, toss up your comb over."
I always wear my hair up. Why do you ask?
Ouch! Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my hair!
Hello my name’s Prince Hairy.
Jack gave me some beans and this happened.
How about we not get hung up on gender roles?
Rapunzel, rapunzel, please let down my hair!
Yeah, I dread locks too.
That's enough gel. Now slide down.
So I was standing in the back of the Great Hall and I told the witch "I wish I was next in line to be heir to the throne." But it was loud in there, and the next thing I knew...
I don't see why you're so surprised, it was listed on my profile!
Do you believe I'm your brother now?
Tell me again, why can't we use a ladder?
It’s gelled.  You should be able to just slide down.
I don't believe we thought this all the way through.
I always doubted climate change, and now I'm not sure about gravity.
OK that was the hard part; now pull me up.
Is this really the time to split hairs?
Sir Isaac Newton be damned.
In retrospect, it probably made more sense for you to climb down first.
Sure, we'll have some drain issues but I'm hoping we can work through that.
It's male pattern boldness
Sorry, Melania, I need all of it for my comb over.
Must you check for lice every time I come home?
Well, could you at least help me get it back into the hat?
You have to climb down the up haircase.
Why do we always go to your place?
I can keep it up all night too.
The plan looked good on paper.
If you pull me up, I will never let you down.
Don’t I look presidential?
The supplements said they'd make me bigger, they just didn't say where...
Thinking outside the locks.
Could you explain to me again how this is supposed to work?
Something went terribly wrong after I ate some of Jack's magic beans.
It's been like this for almost four hours.
This is not going to be a fairy tale ending.
You were right all along.  It's me who needs the rescuing.  I'm sorry.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your sexist preconceptions.
Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Could you let down my hair?
In hindsight, building a ladder would have been quicker.
Yes, today is a good hair day.
I said, 'Come over,' not 'Comb over!'
Simple. First,you pull me up. Then I hang by my heels and you slide down.
It's easier if you just pull me up.
Would you like to tie the knot?
I think we're seeing a paradigm shift.
Things just always seem to work this way here in Australia.
Wait a minute Rapunzel, I think we got this backwards.
Sure, now you appreciate my comb-over.
Well, I thought those magic beans would make a good casserole.
I’m pretty sure the book says “let DOWN your hair.”
I see they don't offer physics in your kingdom.
This isn't what I meant when I suggested you reciprocate.
It also makes the best man bun in the land.
They're extensions.
It’s a Trump toupee. The combing instructions are impossible, but it claims to be the best hairpiece for rappelling women.
Be careful coming down, the mousse makes it slippery.
It's not symbolic of anything, just climb down.
Just even up the ends.
I am just happy to see you.
You should see it when it's curly.
Finally, a good hair day!
Why upbraid me? I am here just to change your locks!
My recipe is equal parts Pantene, Rogaine and Viagra.
Chapter One of:

"Dyslexic Fairy Tales"
Leznupar, leznupar...
No, no. Just jump !
I"'ll pull you up, then you can let me down"
Alas, no winch for the wench.
You wanted long stairs to get down? I thought you said long hairs.
We didn't think this escape plan all the way through.
Nice, but I'm actually waiting for the HEIR apparent.
Let’s make this easy. Take the stairs!
For once just take the elevator like everyone else.
The school board had the story rewritten to be hair neutral.
The bottle said extra strong maximum hold. It even spelled extra and maximum with two x's. I think you'll be fine.
The barber called it an up-do.
That's not how this works. It's not how any of this works.
My ex got the ladder.
I still say a Zip Line would be easier.
I got the idea watching the president.
Just deal with it: you expected Prince Harry, but you got Prince Hairy.
Look, I've already met you more than halfway...
Explain to me again how this is going to work....
Fear not, fair maiden. The man bun obeys neither fashion nor physics.
I'm thinking man-bun.
Pull me up...haven’t you ever heard of gender equality?
Rapunzel, I am your father.
I'll just go get the ladder.
Yes, I'm happy to see you!
Can we do MY place next time?
Seriously, the one grey hair is your takeaway ?
Yes, it's a comb-over.
Maybe pull me up for once.
This should work Rapunzel - I mixed some Viagra in with my Rogaine and BINGO.
Sir Rogaine, at your service m'lady.
It's for when you sleep over at my tower.
Wanna comb over to my castle?
Yes, the cartoons HAVE been getting weaker lately!
I believe I’m the hair apparent.
Brylcream and gorilla glue, my sweet.
'I think we got this backwards.'
I need you to know that I don't let my man bun loose and up just for anyone.
For many years I did Trump impressions.
Pull me up and then I let You down.
I don't know, I thought it made sense—you've never been outside, i'm afraid of heights....Just climb down.
Okay, I showed you mine, now show me yours.
This really only works when you come to my place.
No, no,no, you climb down...
The ad said “male enhancement gel...”
Are you sure,viagra shampoo?
Are you sure you thought this through?
Rapunzel, let down my hair, please.
I said I'd show you mine if you'd show me yours.
Trust me. This is the hard way.
Maybe get a ladder ??
Just take a little off the top
I’m just saying... It’s going to be easier for you to come down than for me to go up.
I get the irony Greg, but exactly how is this supposed to help me?
Um, I'm beginning to think that you should've gone first!
You sure this is how it's supposed to go?
Maybe we should trade places
It's looking Grimm.
A little off the top.
Let's try this with me up there and you down here.
Stop nitpicking and pull me up!
This is the first time you've ever let me down.
I'm sorry. I must have wandered in to the wrong fairy tale.
Please, Rapunzel, I did not come all this way just to be upbraided by you.
Comb-over, Comb-over, I call Rapunzel over!
Would you mind climbing down instead?  I'm afraid of heights.
Really Donald?
Don't yell at me, it's a lot harder to throw it up!"
Well, it started as a simple comb-over...
I'm all for gender equality, Rapunzel, but I just don't think this way is going to work as well.
Well, I thought I'd come up there for a change.
In this day and age, I would never ask that you let down your hair.
Fear not, my love--I used extra hold.
If this doesn't work the sorcerer has spoken to me of a device called a ladder.
Slide down,it will  hold,it's the same hairspray that Trump uses!
How about if you come down instead?
Um, I may not have thought this through
Are you finally ready to tie the knot?
Yes, I'm sure. I saw it in a book.
Well, it looks like we're at split ends.
I don’t believe in traditional gender roles either!
What exactly are we trying to accomplish here?
They say length doesn't matter, but I wanted to play it safe.
Yes, I did eat the magical bean soup. Why do you ask?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel – let down your hair conditioner.
Comb over, comb over, send Rapunzel right over.
It's not just about getting rescued from a tower. It's about redefining traditional gender roles in the workplace.
Is this supposed to impress me?
I find it hard to let my hair down.
I'll be first to admit it ; I have a competitive streak.
OK, my shoes are off. Can I come in now?
Careful - it's a weave.
I ate some seeds from a kid named Jack
Wanna comb-over to my place?
Well it wouldn't make any sense for me to climb up there, would it?
Rapunzel,Rapunzel,let down my hair goddamn it
Tell me again, how will this subvert the patriarchy?
I probably should have just built a ladder.
No you.  I don't like heights.
"To hell with this. Why don' t you just use the elevator?"
What do you mean you've gotten used to the place?
This combover is going to make me president.
I just feel like gender roles are changing.
Of course it will hold you...I used Trump hairspray.
Maybe next time you could come to my place?
Precautions?  Sure my darling-- I brought a scrunchie.
I'm not sure I get where this relationship is heading.
Do you think maybe we've got this upside down?
...I didn't think getting to my polling place would be THIS hard.
Sometimes Viagra affects other body parts.
Like I said 27 years ago... I have a plan to get you down!
I said to myself, if Trump can do it, how hard can it be?
Dandruff? You're worried about dandruff?
Could you take a little off the top?
No, I have not seen "There's Something about Mary". Why do you ask.
Is this another one of your hair-raising schemes?
You can reject the patriarchy and stay up there, or embrace the hair gel and slide on down.
Easy, it’s an extension.
It started as a comb over.
I’m pretty sure, it’s the other way around.
And the carpet matches the drapes, if you know what I mean.
Tie a square knot with yours and I'll be right up!
It is I, Sir Excess of Rogain!
"I promise I won't let you down."
Up the down hairpiece.
Rapunzel, why don't you come down for a change?
I like that we don't adhere to traditional roles.
Geez Rapunzel if you tie it up there and slide, who’s going to untie it?
Soooo....how's this going to work again?
I'm the lock expert you requested.
Tie it to something!
I thought maybe we could go out for a change.
Well, what do you expect for a plan B?
Just an inch off the top
To hell with your fairytale gender norms, I'm letting MY hair up!
I was going to sell it to a wig maker and buy a ladder, but yeah, your idea could work too.
It’s ok...you can do it...I used a lot of hairspray!
I'm not falling for this!
I AM JUST GLAD TO SEE YOU
Aren’t you going to invite me up?
I thought we could go out for a change.
I'm thinking braid, or maybe a bun.
In the village it's called a Trumpé.
I, Sir Pompadour, am here to save you. Slide down.
I have been hoping we can both let our hair down
It's okay, gravity hasn't been discovered yet.
Yes, I know Dr. Freud would love this.
Trust me.
Just a bit off the top.
I'll take a foot off the end and throw in some highlights
We must assess the gravity of the situation.
That isn’t a beanstalk and I’m not Jack.
You’re just a big tease
Role reversal is therapeutic, sweetie - it's just not pragmatic right now.
I just think we should avoid outdated gender roles.
My barber has done it the same for 20 years.  Shorter on the sides and leave it long on top.
Scroll down
Now show me yours.
Listen, I have more than met you half way here.
Come on Rapunzel, let down my hair!
Hmmm I don’t know. I think we should re-read the book.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel let down my hair.
Rapunzel, I think we screwed this up.
Sorry, are we doing this backwards?
I held up my end now you hold up yours.
Yes, I did use a bit of product.
Pull me up! My dad wants me to join the crusades.
Methinks the aphrodisiac is to blame
I actually identify as a ladder.
Yes, yes; tie it to the bedpost, slide down, and, and...foh! Tarry a minute and let me think this out.
Mousse. Lots and lots of mousse.
No no, the combover looks great, but I'm busy tonight.
But you told me you liked it when I wore my hair up.
Before you cut my hair off, let's be sure these slippers fit.
I told you on our first date that I'm very competitive.
You should see it when it's fully erect.
I hope this works, or I just wasted a ton of money on hair gel.
This isn't working, Rapunzel.  Let down my hair.
Want to tie the knot?
This might be the shortest fairy tale ever.
I am the Earl of Pompadour, at your service
I think there's been a mix up, my tickets were for Cinderella.
It only works if I’m up there and you’re down here.
It's a little known version by the other brother Grimm.
It’s a compound of Brylcreem & Viagra.  Hop on, slide down;
the pleasure’s all mine!
Ha!  I bet you’re not laughing at my combover now.
The ends justify the means m'lady.
Somehow, I don't think this is going to work.
Yes, I am Rapunzels brother. Why do you ask?
Who’s Newton?
That's quite a cowlick you've got there.
Rewrite!
This works better if we reverse places
Ok, now jump...
The instructions were in Old English but I think this is right.
Donald taught me how.
Pull!
We've got to get our stories straight or no one will believe us.
It's over, Fred. You voted Republican.
'Tis a man bun, my lady.
Rupunzel! Rupunzel! Slide down my pomade.
Rumpletrumpskin
Hey, fifteen years to grow this. The least you can do is give it a shot
Go ahead and slide down, I moussed it
I said you should COME over!
My Rogaine is your gain, my fair lady!
Do these shoes make me look fat?
Look, I understand that we're trying to challenge gender roles here, but I just don't think gravity is on our side on this one.
It took over 20 gallons of gel, but now you can slide down.
Hair me up, Scotty.
Could you at least meet me half way?
I'm here for the hairway to heaven.
Leznupar, let up your hair.
What do you mean you don't love me?!  It took me twenty-three years to grow this.
They're plugs . . so don't pull.
This seemed much easier in my head.
Wherefore art thou Comb-meo?
I'm tired of always climbing up...you slide down for once!
'IT"S CALLED THE TRUMPIAN COMB"
I think you should try coming over to my house for a change.
Of course I love you, but are we sure about the science here?
I'm thinking of running for president.
Don’t we have this backwards?
They weren’t kidding when they said ‘a little dab will do you.’”
I just didn't want to grow a part.
Maybe we should switch places?
Pull me up, so I can rescue you!
Trust me, it's no fairy tale out here.
I know.  I can't do a thing with it either.
Stop teasing my hair!
Trust me, your situation's not that Grimm.
Now pull.
You can rappel can’t you Rapunzel?
Yes, if you let down your hair, I could climb up to get to you, but then what?
Just a few inches off the top, basically whatever you can reach.
I am excited to see you!
I'm telling you, the hairspray will hold.
Your profile picture looked different.
Please don't tell anyone it's a comb-over.
I've had a hard time reaching you.
It isn’t normally like this. It must be the humidity.
Now just pull me up and we can live happily ever after!
I think the pills worked!
This can’t be right.
I washed my hair with Viagra.
Do we really have time to discuss the Freudian implications of this whole scenario?
From what I've read, I think we've got this backwards.
I completely agree with your point about gender roles, but I still think this would have worked better the other way around.
I’m just saying, it’d be nice to not always be the one doing the climbing.
I feel like we are splitting hairs here
Sorry Rapunzel, you'll have to lift me up again. I grabbed your shoes, not mine !
I think this would be easier if we switched places.
I wanted to comb over tonight.
Make up your mind. Am I going up or are you coming down?
I am sorry darling - Viagra works differently on different people.
Wow, is there anything that coconut oil can't do?
So if you could just take a little off the top.
Oh yeah there’s definitely gum in here
Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your tea tree and coconut oil infused, sulfate- and paraben-free shampoo!
Anything's a ladder with enough hairspray.
I thought you wanted to eliminate gender bias
I didn't expect courtship to be such a hair-raising experience.
Wait. I think we're doing this wrong.
I'm your 2 o'clock appointment"
There's gel in it. Just slide down.
Of course I'm serious.  I spent a fortune on hair spray.
Up is now down, Rapunzel.
Call me a purist, but this one reason why I hate fan fiction.
If you'd been living out here you'd know why I want to be pulled up!
Well, if you think THIS is strange, wait till you see the cartoonist's take on 'Rumpelstiltskin'.
It's an updoo.
Sorry about my hair, I recently switched over to "Jack's Magic Beans" shampoo.
We only have four hours until I have to call a doctor.
Pull, dammit.
Fairy Tales 2018 Edition:
Reversing the Gender Roles
Now can you appreciate my man-bun?
Don't worry; it'll hold! I use the same hairspray as Trump!
It's a magic comb over.  Jump on and slide on down.
I'm not just the president of Hair Club for Men, I'm also a client.
Doth not devotion outweigheth poor planning?
How is your idea any different?
Try to remember, Prince. You take the Viagra. I use the Minoxidil.
Let’s rethink this...
The label says strong hold
They call it a "Cowlick".
This could be our last meeting - I'm out of hair gel.
You're sure it works both ways?
When you go high, I go low
Oh shoot, you were supposed to go first
and you said my manbun was useless
A little off the top please
Are those new extensions or are you just really happy to see me?
Rapunzel, still think we don't have anything in common?
So, is it a gray?
So if I lose the comb-over, then you’ll come down?
I changed my mind... pull me up instead!
I didn’t say I was troubled by a bad cough. I said by a “bad coif!”
You’re living in a fairy tale if you think I have the upper body strength for this.
Climb down, or pull me up. Works either way.
This is such a lose lose situation.
No No, don't slide, Rapunz, rappel, rappel.
It seems the product I got over the internet for that...uhh...little problem of mine has a side effect...
Hurry, my love. The Aqua Net won't hold forever.
OK , that works too.
You could just jump.
I think this'll work better if you let your hair down instead.
I thought I'd let my hair up for a change.
My Lady, I don't think the gravity of our situation will be enough.
It’s safe to come down. I used five bottles of hair gel.
Careful! It's not mine.
I've been climbing your hair all week, how about you meet me halfway?
Just take a little off the top, please.
They really seemed confident role reversal would help us.
Don't worry, I used maximum hold.
I’m afraid of heights, so I thought maybe you could come down instead.
how about YOU ask ME out?
I can't plant the magic beans. I ate them.
Best comb-over ever!
I think we got this bass ackwards.
It looked so easy in the infomercial.
Not too much off the top.
Don't worry, it's "extreme hold".
I thought you said, "Can you hair me."
You said you wanted me to meet you halfway...'
It's the same gel that Trump uses.
Well, do you want to be rescued or wait for a prince without dandruff?
Keep scrolling! Eventually you'll get to the good part.
What do you mean I can't come up?
If you see a gray one, be a dear and pull it out.
Sign there to indicate that you've reviewed the Perms & Conditions.
I had a Translator read the story to me.
I told you we should have gone with the ladder option.
It's now or never. The kingdom is out of hairspray.
I don't care what you read in a fairy tale, this isn't going to work!
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, throw down your Nair™.
Okay, now pull me up. Unless you can think of a better idea.
There's a metaphor in this somewhere.
I agree, but in a post-truth world a lot of things don't seem exactly right.
Mind if I comb over?
I was thinking about our situation, and then suddenly - BAM! Right off the top of my head, it came to me.
Are you sure this is how the fairy tale goes?
Right, now just slowly climb down.
Toupee, or not toupee?
Never mind the split ends; my ROOTS are strong, just pull me up.
I'm all about bucking gender roles, but how's this supposed to work?
Is that 50 gallons of hair spray or are you just glad to see me?
Slide down, I used plenty of gel.
My unruly hair had kept love way out of reach. Then I tried Rapun-gel!
Rapunzel, my love, I'm trying a different approach.
Come to think of it, Wig World may have sent "The Beanstalk," not "The Rapunzel."
Foreget whose hair is suppose to do what and just slide down.
You know, I think let down is gonna read better than lift up”
Rapunzel, I think reverse engineering  is not going to work
I see where you are going with this, but it's not going to have a happy fairytale ending.
I am not sure if I mentioned this in my profile.
I don't care what your therapist told you, this roll-reversal idea just isn't going to work.
Try tying it off to the radiator, then slide down.
I said, "pick the lock" not "pick a lock."
Pull me back up! These aren’t my running shoes.
Even taller with my shoes ON.
Can't we just cuddle and talk like a normal couple?
How many Viagra did you take??
Just tie it to the table and push the table down the stairs.
I’m not really sure how this helps you.
A comb-over by definition is over the top.
That's not entirely fair -- "Step Two"  was confusingly written.
It's surprising what you can conceal beneath a beret.
We can't go on like this. I'm getting a haircut.
Go ahead it’s extra-hold.
I thought we could try a role reversal this time around?
Please, stop teasing me.
w
What kind of hair-brained scheme is this?
It started as a comb-over.  What's your story?
It's OK, all we have to do is change places.
The body! The texture...and not a single split-end!
Like my ends, I'm afraid we must split.
Is that you hair, or are you excited to see me?
Occupational Health and Safety now recommend sliding down rather than climbing up
I think I have this fairy tale thing backwards.
Something just doesn't seem quite right.
Donald, Donald, send up your hair,
So I might descend the Trump Tower stair.
Perfect!  You mixed the concrete in with your shampoo, just like I told you!
This is lousing up the storyline.
Not too hard! They're extensions.
You and your stupid fairy tales. Just pull!
I don’t think this is getting us anywhere.
One day, I will run for president.
It really works! I got out of Scientology this way!
I think we've got this backwards, Leznupar!
Wait, wait! Let's think this through a little.
Stop teasing me!
I use a coconut oil leave in treatment, you'll slide right down.
Think of our heirs!
A magic formula given to me by Sir Rogaine. Why do you ask?
If this relationship is going to work, we're going to have to go in a different direction.
Uh-oh darling, I see a gray.
Thanks for finding my shoes.  There also might be a wallet and some keys.
Rapunzel . It won't work this way.
Have you seen "There's something about Mary"?
OK, good.
I used Trump's hair gel. You'll be fine.
I think I'll wait for someone who knows which way is up.
Toupee or not toupee?  That is the question.
Are you aware of the gravity of yours situation?
Only medievials still wear man buns.
You had better slide down soon. After all, you know what they say - "Hair today, gone tomorrow."
Really? You could tell it's a comb over?
Maybe you can't see it from up there, but the shoe is not on the other foot.  I took them both off.
I combed in Gorilla Glue. Slide on down.
Prince Cowlick …  I’m so lucky it is you that happened by!
This could only happen in a fairy tale.
Leznupar, Leznupar, I'm sending up my hair.
It started out as a harmless comb over, but then it turned on me.
Am i coming down or you are coming up?
You can't let me win anything, can you?
I grow it long for exactly this kind of situation.
I thought your dating profile said you were into role reversal.
When I said I'd trade places with you, this isn't exactly what I meant.
It's all about the gel.
Funny you should ask... Yes, I do use product.
No, this is a bad idea. Why don't you just let go and stay put?
Or, if it makes you queasy, you could take the elevator.
If you won’t lower your hair, at least lower your standards.”
Are you sure it's extra hold?
Rapunzel Rapunzel, slide down my hair
You could pull me up, or I could pull you down.
Now you tell my there's a door around back.
Do you see any grey?
To be honest, I prefer bald men.
I have a reverse Rapunzel complex that defies both logic and gravity.
Clearly a hair raising incident.
Damn!  The cartoonist really screwed up on this one!  What the hell is going on at the New Yorker?
Halt! Who goes hair?
You're not Cinderella?
I told you my man bun would come in handy.
Rapunzel, there must be an easier way to do this.
Somehow, we have to reverse-engineer this.
What do you mean there's someone else?
Do I tell him that even from up here the combover isn't convincing?
Rapunzel had a younger sister, Edith......who was slow and the source of much family embarrassment.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, wilt thou believe in the hairway to Steven!
Just slide, it’s gelled!
would it be easier if i just walk up?
Fair maiden, ‘tis me, Sir Rogaine, at your service
Let's split before the ends do.
Let go of your gender stereotypes and just tie my hair to something.
Technically it is ear hair, but when I comb it properly you'd never know.
I use the same hairspray as Trump
There's just enough product to get you down.
Leznupar! Leznupar! Tel nwod ruoy riah!
Good catch!
Hi, The name is Raypunzal.
Can’t I take the stairs.
Hop on quick. This hair gel won't last all day.
I understand that long hair ropes are no longer women’s work and hope my progressive compliance impressed you. But logistically, couldn’t one of us equally capable people have built a ladder months ago? Sorry if that came off as mansplaining.
I guess what they say is true, life's not like the fairy tales.
Can I be on top for once?
I'm not sure about a happy ending. Looks more like a split ending to me."
My love, you make my feet swell, and my hair stand on end.
Last I heard, this is supposed to be the other way around.
Are you sure it’s supposed to work like this?
Could you arrange it like Trump's?
Rapunzel, let down your hair conditioner.
Just FYI, I took a lot of flack for that man-bun.
Listen, I really like you, and you're going to find out anyway. 
It's a rug.
I guess I'll just wait for you to mullet over.
Do you have an extra scrunchy?
How do I do it ???
I use the same Hair Spray as Donald Trump, but without the Orange Color
What do you mean you don't want to come down anymore?

I guess this was a harebrained idea.

Get it? 'Hair'-brained... Because I grew my– 

Ow. That hurts. Ow! No more puns, I swear!

Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down my hair!"
So who's being sexist now?
I pray thee, chide me not! T'is true though, I must concede; It seems the apothecary has added some aphrodisiac to my dandelion and rosemary shampoo.
Now it's my turn to be the princess!
I'm running late-Rapunzel, can you please let down my hair?
You see? I told you we had lots in common!
OK I’ve shown you mine, now let me see yours
I think I can fit you in next Tuesday.
Let’s not split hairs.
You think MY idea's lame?
The stylist said it would make me look taller...
Darling, I could never bear to part.
I swear, I'm not overcompensating!
It's gender-bending, I know, but this is the 12th century!
Trust me, really
By God, this is the worst case of static I've ever seen!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let my hair down!!
Hold real tight, Rapunzel, and I'll climb up my hair.
We could explore the masculine/feminine axis of this kind of turnaround or you could just toss me the key.
Okay Rapunzel, it's either hair today or I'm gone tomorrow!
Seriously, this makes way more sense.
The bottle just said "volumizing"...
Rapunzel, I’ve comb-over for you.
Who are you to judge?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, you’re let down by my long hair?
No, No, I'm Rapunzel!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your gender norms.
I don't care how much hair gel you used, I'm not sliding down it.
It’s a two-way street, babe.
I  JUST  RUBBED  IT  WITH  VIAGRA.
I’m not only the hair club President. I’m also the King.
My hair dresser calls it "The Trumpian Twister" and it doubles as a slippery slope when necessary. Please slide down with caution.
I'm meeting you more than half-way.
Pull me back up. I’ve so had enough of reality.
Great concept. Lousy physics.
Trust me, I read about this in a book somewhere.
What's a ladder ?
Yes, fine, it's like a hair-boner. Now hurry and get down on it!
I'm trying to pull my own weight in this relationship.
You've got to be kidding, I've been planning this for years.
Let’s watch that YouTube video again.
Go ahead, pull me up.
This is a hair-raising situation.
No!! You pull ME up!! It’s crazy out here!!
I'm thinking frosted tips, but I'd consider dreadlocks.
I was waiting for a good hair day
I think you need to stop questioning the plan.
I have an egalitarian point of view. You climb down this time, I will climb up next time.
I used 73 jars of gel. You can just climb on and slide down.
Has this happened with all the princes you've been with?
It's not you. It's me.
Ok, maybe it was a hair-brained idea...
I spun it from straw polls.
Honey, let's just try to make it work."
This really hurts. Are you sure there's no door around back?
Aqua Net; why do you ask?
I spent a fortune on Rogaine to save you.
Really Rapunzel?  Can't we just TRY it my way?
This isn't how it goes in the story.
OK, but then how do we get down?
I used a new product called Trump Hair Starch.
I always did prefer a man with a good head of hair.
Don't make it look like a comb-over.
Maybe we should see if this glass slipper fits first?
I thought you'd appreciate the role reversal.
I don't care what they write. Just pull me up!
Not for lack of time, but I didn't really think this through.
Why, yes, I am Lord Pompadour, how did you guess?
Next time at my tower?
I'm sorry, it's one of the side effects.
Jump !! It’s wrapped around a bungee cord.
Hair brained ? How could you say that !
Careful with the updo - I’d like to get at least two days out of it.
Its a pompadour.
You need to do something about your split ends.
No... I'm here to save YOU.
It’s 2018, I can be who I want
I calleth it the maxi-mullet.
Of course I use product.
Want to come over to my place for a change?
This is not how I thought this would go
If we can get someone to turn this magazine upside-down, you can climb up my hair and into my arms.

Otherwise, Rapunzel, I’d say we’re screwed.
I think I'll go now. We just have too much in common.
And none of the men in the family show signs of baldness.
Dear Rapunzel, we are about to shift the paradigm.
Hair Suitor
Of course it's a weave."
This is the best I can do, Melania.
If you help me fix it, I can run for President
I don't know why but this just doesn't feel right!
No, it's actually my good hair day.
Your hair was a let down.
So you're saying that my man-bun has been a waste of time?
Maybe try the door again...?
I thought it said to use a cupful of Rogaine; it actually said to use a capful.
Too much mousse?
I’m from Uber.
Comb-overs are a family tradition.
Do you think it's too long for a man bun?
Maybe I shouldn't have eaten those three magic beans.
I think the hair spray did the trick.
Dyslexic?  Me?  Why do you ask?
I can come up if you can't come down
No, I'm not saying you can't do it. It's just, maybe we're taking this whole 'reversing gender roles' thing a bit too far."
I told you it was real!
Pull me back up!  It’s the 2018 midterms!
No, I'm Donald's brother.
Talk about a hair raising experience.
I guess I overdid it with the Viagra
'I come from the Kingdom of Miracle Grow.'
Comb-over, m'lady!
This ain't no fairy tale honey.  Just grab hold, shimmy on down and let's get the hell out of here.
Medievaldating.com said we were an 87% match.
Rapunzel, honey, I think we've got this thing backwards.
No, I'm NOT just one-upping you!
I popped a fistful of Rogaine and Viagra . . . soooo, I have something else to show you when you get down.
Don’t let your barber take off more than this much.
Forget coming down for living happily ever after! Just pull me up and we'll stay in our ivory tower, and never hear a word about Trump again!
I know times are hard right now, but I promise you one day we'll be able to afford a rope.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your hair dryer.
I'm not the just president of the Hair Club, I'm also a client
When I said we weren’t using my hair, I thought you’d bring a ladder.
Hey stupid, the King is longing for an heir, not for someone with long hair.
I figured it’s the least I could do for gender equality.
No, no, it’s supposed to be “RAPUNZEL, let down your hair!”
I don't think it works that way.
M’lady, ‘tis usually kempt, in a knight bun.
Going to a ball tonight, so just a little off the top.
Donald!
Don’t worry! I used super-hold gel.
Now, HOW exactly is this gonna work ???
And then, Baron, Rapunzel cried, "Donald! Donald! Let up your hair!"
Love is in the hair
I knew I shouldn’t have read the abridged version of this tale.
Too much product?
I think we misunderstood...
Just take care of the scraggly ends for now, I have a battle at 2.
You expect me to wrap this into a "man bun?"
I used enough gel so you can slide down.
Pretty good for a comb over, right?
Take about an inch off the ends.
Did I use too much product?
We ALWAYS go to my place.
So, are we going   up or down?
For christsake Raz, just hang on tight, and slide down.
Take the stairs, it’s only a medium hold gel.
Not clear on the concept.
Leznuper, Leznuper, let up your hair
Come on down...I used all the hairspray in the kingdom.
I might have gone a bit overboard on the up-do.
Rapunzel, honey, I thought we discussed this.
Let's hope the hairspray holds.
But, if you pull me up, how do we both get down?
Oh.  Well, what DID you mean by Role Reversal?
Now, pull me up.
I’m donating it to “Princesses Stuck in Towers.”
YES it is real, just pull!
Usually, I'm on top.
Now you see why it took 7 years.
I think that we got the story wrong!
You should see my pubes.
Hairagra.
I realize now it's more of a Dippity-Don't Do.
I think is better if you jump, these are extensions
Trust me, the gel will hold.
You want me to pull you up?
Shall I come up, then?
You haven't read much Newtonian physics, have you?
Please climb down, babe. It won't be in style that much longer.
Lather, rinse, and repeat. What’s yours?
Forget Prince -- I'm going to be President someday.
The name’s Trump. Donald Trump.
I'm hair for you.
Rapunzel, let MY hair down!!
you said 'comb over'
Pull me up
Sir Isaac may have discovered gravity, but I’ve discovered static electricity, m’lady!
But I thought you believed in role reversal!
How do I get back up?
What the hell, mom!
Now I see why you were supposed to be the one with long hair.
See, your mother is totally wrong, we have soooo much in common.
Something's not right.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair products.
It gets hard when you fondle it.
Are you sure this is how Trump does it?
I can’t do a thing with it, but maybe you can
Talk about a reversal of roles!
Just HOW MUCH longer??
Maybe we should try it my way.
Yes, I am the Prince of Mullett!
Of course it’s gone grey. I’ve been growing it for you for 35 years.
Well, you know, they're always looking for a new spin on an old story.
I'm the hair -apparent to the throne
If you see a gray one, could you pull it out?
Dandruff? I defy physics out of love for you and the only thing you say is that I have dandruff?
Years from now it'll be all about your hair, not mine!
I thought I was Rapunzel
Sliding down should be easy, but landing might be a bit awkward.
Not your best idea, Rapunzel.
I'm not here for you, I just really wanted to know what conditioner you used.
No! No! Not that one!
Just the long grey one...
the really long grey one in the middle.

David B. Smith
Miami Beach, Florida
Man up.
My manbun's come undone!
Yes, the cake with the file inside is there. Keep looking.
Uncle Albert says gravity is just a curvature in spacetime.
Rapunzel, don't climb down! I just thought of a reason why this won't work.
It’s gel, slide down.
You misunderstand, I asked to see your heir-line
I just had it done...they call it a new twist on an old classic.
It was your idea to role-play!
Rapunzel, the problem is not the prenup, it's the non-compete clause.
And just think, everyone told me that I should cut my mullet.
We need to rethink our strategy here.
Don't worry, this Presidential hair product comes with its own alternative gravity.
How can you let a few loose ends come between us?
Comb-over, not climb-over!
I pray thee ask yourself if you believe in me or Mr. Newton.
Can you pull me up? It's scary out here.
Quick! Before the wind changes!
Just keep looking. The Wi-Fi password’s in there somewhere.
Curses , I think I'm in the wrong cartoon.
I'm all for gender role reversal, but I'm not sure if this one is going to work.
Wow, me too!
I’m running for President.
Oh, come on. What good is a safe word if you can never remember it?
Just a trim, I'm concerned about the split ends.
Now, my turn to play with yours.
Rapunzel -- you're such a tease.
If I'm Repunzel, who are you?
Is this really the time to be commenting on my split ends?
I can't quite make out the proclamation, but it reads, " Hair to the Throne?"
Come on! Let's not split hairs over this.
Wait, there's something wrong with this picture!
Just a few more inches Mr Trump and your comb over will be back to normal.
Try standing on your head.
Hair ya go.
I'm not only the Hair Club Prince, but I'm also a client.
Relax, it's not a competition. Yours is nice too.
I told you I'm a feminist!
I can't figure it out either.
Please tell me these aren't extensions.
How much mousse did you use?
The mane thing is ..... mother says I'll never be able to support you.
As you can see, this was supposed to be my tower.
.nwod no emoc ,leznupaR
Can you tell me again how this works?
I got the idea while watching a press conference"
I think there’s enough hair gel now... so you can just slide down.
Don't pull too hard. Some of them are extensions.
Wait a minute. Don’t we have this backward?
Read your contract. This is not how the story goes!
Your letting me down.
I'm going to suggest we rethink this whole thing.
Leznupar, Leznupar, raise up your hair!
We can talk about my split ends later, let's just go!
How could this relationship work if I wasn't willing to meet you halfway?
Rapunzel, the way you follow directions is pretty Grimm.
Is it too late to change places?
It's OK, I've got your shoes!
Just trim a few feet off - the Prince and I are over and I don't want him thinking he can just climb back into my life.
These gender neutral fairy tales do leave some plot holes.
Rapunzel, take hold my golden man bun, that I may climb to your safe place
Why don'y I just take the stairs?
You're right, parting IS such sweet sorrow!
You were right. Looking up to a woman in higher office is electrifying AND hair-raising.
Lice?
What the hell good is this going to do me?
Rupuntzel, Repuntsel, let go of my hair!
The tech guys assured me this would work.
It was truly a hair-raising adventure
Well, maybe I can just go get a ladder for you.
My witch kept me in a pit.
You know, Rapunzel, you're the only one who ever gets me so excited as this!
Getting to you continues to be a hair raising experience.
The man bun was so 2017.
I'm your brother Denzel. Pull me up.
Yes, you have lice.
I use the same hair stuff as Trump; climb on down.
I spent a fortune on product to make it do this, so stop complaining and slide down.
Rapunzeversal
I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be the other way around."
It’s not stiff enough.
Romantic, perhaps, but a sturdy ladder would have sufficed.
Climb down.  I used lots of hair spray.
How's your upper body strength?
I accept walk-ins, but I charge by the foot.
Everybody laughed at my comb-over; but I knew it would come in handy one day, my love.
The soothsayer says the style will be famous in 2016.
Is that a volumizing styling clay, or are you just happy to see me?
I find societally-defined gender roles to be excessively confining.
I joined the Hair Club for Princes.
Hurry down before the frizz sets in.
Do you SEE those split ends? I am the one that needs rescuing.
I like the idea of role reversals, but you’re going to need more gel.
I've heard of role reversal, but this is ridiculous.
Ironically, my name is Bob.
But you said you wanted me to be more like you!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, do you do highlights?
Much like your ends, I think it's time we split.
C'mon, just pull me up!
I just thought this way we could avoid that whole gender stereotypes thing.
At least it's not a man bun.
Don't think of it as breaking both your legs, think of it as shattering gender stereotypes.
I think we did something backwards.
The Combover: both attractive AND practical.
Repunzel, Repunzel, let down your traditional gender roles!
I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
Honestly, I'm not mansplaining.
Your such a tease!
This doesn't feel right...
I'm here to make the Kingdom great again.
You found a nit? Is that all you have to say?
Don't worry. It said it'll have a long lasting hold.
I am not wigging out.
Well, yes, you could yank me up, instead.
The stylist said it was 'a new take on an old classic'.
Do we have to discuss my split ends right now?
You said you liked it long
A little off the top and sides.
Thou love defies gravity
But I thought you supported defying gender norms.
Just hold my hair and jump. I used the shampoo that puts extra bounce in your hair.
It portends what awaits you should you choose to slide down.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, climb down my comb-over!
Of course I can't damned well climb up it!
...so I thought to myself, if I hear 'let your hair down' one more time...
Shoot.  We still have the gravity problem.
Gender Equality: now your turn to do the work. Pull me up!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel I think we've got this all wrong so just jump and I'll catch you.
Are you coming down or not?
Something about this seems bass-akward...
Easy - it took a whole cauldron of gel.
Oh geez... I'm suppose to rescue you with YOUR long hair?"
swing me again!
I know you said you had a comb over, but really?
I like what you’ve done - sober wench in the front; medieval faire in the back.
Please, let go.
Wait - you lather, rinse, AND repeat?!
Well? Can’t you pull me up?
It might work better if you were down here and I was up there
Ever wake up and feel like you're in a fractured fairy tale?
I don't think you really Googled this right.
That's not how this works, Steve!
I don't want you to think I'm using you for your hair.
The king's gone mad. Pull me up!
Wait..how is this supposed to work now?
I just don't think this is a stable enough foundation for a relationship.
It feels better when I'm on top.
Let’s drag you up by your hair for a change
Wait a minute – you’re going to pull me up?
Okay Miss Prisoner.  Do you have a better idea?
I think this fairytale is vertically challenged.
Just a little off the ends...
Are you sure this is how it worked in the YouTube video?
This is becoming a hair raising experience, but who am I to talk?
Rapunzel? The script says Delilah. Did he draw me in the wrong panel again?
Wait, you have this backwards!
I dunno.  Pull me up?
Good catch! Now, lift with your legs.
I always felt the other way just perpetrated gender stereotypes.
The script says “let DOWN your hair!”
I'll just remind you that you first laughed at my man-bun.
Something's not right here.
Just a couple inches off the top, I’m growing it out right now.
After I finished, I realized he was Trump's stylist.
Okay, your turn.
If you pull me up, you can then use my hair to climb down, but then I'll be stuck in the tower!
The therapist said we should try to empathize more.
Of course it stays stiff.  What are you thinking?
Manbunzel, Manbunzel, please wash your hair!
I’d go to any length for you!
You know the recommended time between haircuts is three to six weeks, right?
Hairy up!
OK now... you said you’d toss me yours if I tossed you mine
I thought you can slide down instead.  I am not much of a climber.
Are you sure this is the only way up?
I guess I’m just a little excited to see you again.
Tie it off and climb down. And bring a scissor.
What do you mean I make your issues all about me?
It is I, Sir Richard of Dyslexia.
Go ahead. I used tons of hair spray.
What a letdown!
I use a lot of product.
Whoops!  I think your man bun has come undone.
You'll be fine—I used hemp shampoo.
It's like an emergency exit on an airplane: just slide down.
Why should this detail always be the woman’s responsibility?
Can you French braid it?
Yes, I did have beans for dinner at Jack's last night. How did you know?'
Will you help me fix my man bun?
Dearest Rapunzel, what we've got here is failure to communicate.
Have you considered a man bun?
No, no....don't come down.  I'm coming up.  You have the rent controlled apartment.
If you want to live happily ever after, you gotta start pulling.
This is what equality looks like.
I’ve just always had a problem with the gender-role confines of fairy tales.
Allow me to explain. Your hair needs to be at least this long.
Be gentle, they're extensions."
Don't worry, the gel will hold!
Pardon me, Your Highness, but you called for the hair force, not the air force!
I can't take the politics any longer.  Please pull me up.
It's my new pill, climb down and find out what else it can do.
Let's go to my place tonight.
Because I want to be on top for once.
I said "Get a bottle of Rogaine, not "Take a bottle of Rogaine.'
Thanks for waiting.
I thought I would try a different strategy
Honestly this is more repelling than rappelling.
Yeah, there's more product than usual. If you don't like it take the stairs!
Clearly you have been a Trump supporter for quite some time.
So you see Rapunzel, I thought if we put our heads together we could find a way to get you out of that tower.
our hair care products will set you free
I moussed it for you.
I think we need to use your hair
Trust me, it's the stiffest gel in the kingdom.
I'm going to try cutting back on the Rogaine a bit.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my comb over.
Fairy tale. Hairy tale. Does it really matter?
Now lift.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, grab hold my hair 
so that you may slide down my gel-slicked stair.
Recently, literary scholars uncovered a first draft of the Rapunzel narrative. Its significance for future interpretations remains unclear.
I Trumpenized my hair so it's safe to slide down.
Actually no, I am Sir Lance-up-locks."
We Drumpfs know a thing or two about hair.
Be careful! It's my combover.
So now you know its a comb over.
Is this how it's supposed to go ?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind...
Lice check, again?
Wait, is it upload or download?
I was thinking your place instead of my parent's basement.
We're gonna need more hairspray!
I tried to tell you that it wouldn't work!
"If you think THAT'S something..."
Hast thou been watching that pole dancing video I sent?
It's the 21st century Rapunzel, give up gender norms!
Milady, I’m afraid our future is up in the air.
With hair like this you may be a Prince but you'll never be President.
Your plight is hair-raising.
You called for a pickup?
Princess, can't you see how far I've comb?
Is this deja vu, or am I in the wrong fairytale?
I think we have this ass-backwards!
And just imagine how great our kid's hair will be!
Haul me up and I’ll save you.
Sir Issac doesn't know everything!
This relationship isn’t working. I feel like I’m doing all the work.
Your ivory tower makes you a poor judge on what is 
practical here.
Yeah...it IS kind of wild.    I ate a magic bean.  I'm Jack.  Want to get coffee?
No, you're right - considerate troubadour does make more sense than considerable pompadour.
So, how do you want this to go down?”
And you’re sure you don’t just want to take the elevator?
Force of habit, I suppose, but does it really matter why I brought the hat?
I told you it was a bad hair day.
no, that's NOT what gender equality means
Just trim the ends...
I'm going toupée for this.
Is this a ladder in his hair, or is he just glad to see me?”

Greg Fukutomi, New York Cit
Repunzle? Repunzle. Let down my hair.
Repugnant, Repugnant, let go my hair!
Leznupar , pull up my hair!
I hate climbing!
What do you think, should I grow it out or leave it short like this?
Rappelsel, Rapunsel, what's the difference?
The magic hair potion worked, but can you do anything for my split ends?
No, the curtains don't match the carpet.
I figured you of all people would appreciate the "up" do.
Melania, I told you not to mess with my hair!
If you can't pull me, at least help me to make a bun."
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, throw down your hair-tie!
You've found the keys a decade ago??
You said to ask for an up-do!
I got a tweet that said to keep combing it forward.
Last chance!  My haircut appointment is in 30 minutes.
Please reconsider letting yours down
You can try but I am not sure the gel will hold.
I'll rescue you if you promise to tell no one about the comb-over.
I don’t mean to split hairs, but there’s no way this will hold!
I think I used too much Rapunz-Gel.
Isn't this move just a hair backwards?
Rapunzel, I don’t think this is the way it works.
I didn’t know this is what you meant by “we’ll see how you feel when the shoe is on the other foot.”
Now is not the time to criticize my split ends.
Come back after you've conditioned
It's business in front, maaaaaajor party in back.
About four hours. Why do you ask?
I just hate to let a good hair day go to waste.
You have no idea how much hair spray I had to use.
You know we are living in parallel universes, right?
So it turns out the magic beans make a passable cassoulet.
Slide down.  It’s gelled.
Oh, so you’re more into short-haired guys now?
It's just like pole vaulting.
Let down your conditioner.
I borrowed it from The Donald
Not mine! Yours!!
Somehow, this isn’t how I had envisioned it.
Would you like a blowout?"
"No thanks, just tower dry today.
It's shellacked so you can use it as a slide.
Long hair is such a let-down!
Climb down my comb-over.
What are you waiting for? Help me up.
Leznupar, Leznupar, let up your long hair!
I don't think this is the way this is supposed to work.
I’m sorry if this is such a letdown.
You gotta a problem with comb-overs?
Head & Shoulders ... why?
extra hold hair gel, can't remember the brand, does that matter?
Your turn."
The barber assured me that the hair spray will hold
Hurry! The hair gel will only hold so long.
These CVS receipts are getting ridiculous
Why should you get all the credit every time?
What do you mean ‘split ends’ !
I don't think this is how feminism works.
It's like Viagra, but for hair!
So, we'll take off 16 feet, yes?"
Buzzer's broken.
I've made a vow not to cut my hair until the invention of ladders.
Would it make it easier to climb down if I added more mousse?
I can't do a thing with it today.
Don't worry, honey, it's safe - I used POTUS's hairspray.
Just jump! I' ll be hair!
”I use gel, why do you ask
I heard you're into hair.
So you can wear yours down but I can't do an updo?!
Rappel-Zel.
Not quite sure that's how it works
As soon as the band finishes touring I'll come back for you.
Can you pull me up?
A little mousse, a little spray,  and et voila, Ralphpunzel.
What  ? Don’t tell you are having another hair raising adventure .
I swear the engagement ring is in there  somewhere.
I traded my cow for some magic beans, and look what happened!
Please? I've waited forever for this appointment.
I'm here to rescue YOU, Rapunzel. I just haven't worked out all the logistics yet....
Rapunzel, you know that Newton and Einstein don't agree on gravity.
Sorry?  You weren’t thinking?  Do you have any idea how long it took me to grow this thing?
I did not travel all this way for you to judge me.
Eight coats of floor wax. It'll hold you. Just grab on and slide down.
The dream made so much sense, but I seem to have misremembered it somehow.
Let's prove them wrong.
I have those new shoes you wanted, but I'm not sure we've thought this through.
I bought hair gel from a guy named Jack.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, slide down my gel.
I know I have split ends, that's really not the problem here
Rapunzel, rapunzel, pull me up by my hair.
I would have rather you just dropped me
Frankly you should jump instead
What makes you think I’ve been seeing someone else?
Wait! I know this guy, Jack. He can help!
Don’t worry. I used extra-hold.
Wait, so you're saying I didn't have to grow it out?!?!"
Dandruff? I used the five cans of mousse your fairy godmother told me to use and you're not going to slide down because of a little dandruff?
Everyone laughed when I kept yelling, 'Lock her up!'  over and over. Everyone laughed at my ridiculous, wrap-around hair.  What did they know?  Who's laughing now?
Come down to my place for a change.
I used "extra hold" this time, it'll work!
You said you wanted unconventional, dear.
Don't worry. I used extra strength gel.
Knowing you, Rapunzel, has been a hair raising experience.”
I'm gender-binary so I have the quest of the knight in shining armor but the hair of the damsel-in-distress princess.
In light of recent events, I thought it was time for me to pitch in.
Until now, you've been confined by gender roles.
What do you mean, a split end?
M'Lady, doth size really matter?
I wasn't planning on coming up, but now that you mention it...
As tropes go this is all messed up.
Viagra for hair.
Yes, those are definitely split ends.
Slide down, I used Aqua Net!
Perfect! Now just climb down.
First, pull me up. Next... no, wait, don’t pull me up.
I swear the carpet doesn't match the drapes.
I sure hope we gel.
Just a trim
I don't care how long it is, I'm still not going out with you.
Figured it was #myturn.
It's over, hon - I'm switching to a man bun.
The gel was Extra Hold but still be careful.
I'm hair to save you
Ready for a hair-raising adventure?
We're lucky that Parliament hasn't passed the laws of gravity yet.
It's something new called Reverse Engineering.
Pull me up, I'm tired of having to climb.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and... your not Juliet--OMG, this is Grimm.
Sir Gelahad at your service, my lady.
Well, thank God it’s not a man bun!
I think you must have me confused with some other princess
You're supposed to let your hair down, not pull mine up, Rapunzel. When will you stop listening to fairy tales on Fox News?
I tried a new straightener but it didn't get rid of my cowlick.
What, too much product?
I misread the job description.
How 'bout I ask Jack if we can borrow his beanstalk?
Well, if I had known that, I would've been here MONTHS ago!
The hard part is getting the hair into this hat.
It’s less exciting but maybe you should take the elevator …
Who knew this would come in handy for the 'Get Out the Vote' campaign?
Rogaine!
Hurry up! The Viagra is wearing off!
Yes,with both hands. Trust me-- it's physics!
Please stop braiding and start lifting.
I could cut here and you'd still be fine
Can you just trim a bit off the ends?
I have an MFA in Rewriting the Classics.
I took Viagra.  Slide down quickly!
Gravity? Sounds like another one of your debatable scientific theories. Now are you climbing down here or not?
I knew my comb over would come in handy.
Maybe you should read it again to be sure.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down my hair!  I'm already late for work, and this tower doesn't pay for itself.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, please don’t pull on my hair! I have just come from my stylist and it needs special care
What do you mean the engagement is off?
Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let DOWN my long hair!
Slide down and then I’ll trim it.
It's a comb UP, not Over.
Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Repel down my hair!
I said,"Bring me a pony's tail,
Not a horses ass".
No, it’s fine - we can use yours.
I feel like we're one of those couples that are stating to look alike
Babe, I swear, it's not this long when it's curly!
Look here, Rapunzel, this role-reversal thing has gone to far.
My love, your beauty is hair-raising.
It's me not you.
Quit looking for split ends and slide down.
It looks weird, but keep an open mind.
The gel should hold.
First I shampoo with awapuhi and deionized water, then a leave-in conditioner that's rich in amino-acids, then I comb-in a light but firm hold cream wax and finally I brush it aggressively with a Muskrat-bristle brush and, voila!
I knew one day someone would appreciate my cowlick.
...plus my father is President
These dang directions are upside down.
NO! Don't pull me up. It's a wig.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my hair. I will put on my shoes and climb up the stair!
My blowout rocketh.
Can we please discuss my split ends some other time?
Just be glad it's not a man bun.
Comb over or extensions?
I'm starting to think I may be dyslexic.
Now don't get competitive.
That's 6 cans of hair spray.  Slide on down for a change.
Slide down, it's safe. I used a ton of gel.
Next time, we're going to my house
I would have been here sooner, but I was having a bad hair day.
I don't know! The whole world just seems upside down.
Is it gum?
You want me to cut here?
Rescue you? Actually, I just wanted some tips for split ends.
Hurry Juliet, the Viagra I rubbed in may only last a few hours"
Ok, maybe I didn't read your scroll THAT carefully
No, I can’t tell it’s a comb over.
Lots of hairspray. Just slide on down.
Rapunzel Rapunzel, PLEASE LET GO OF MY HAIR.
It started as a comb over, then I had a fight with my barber.
Damn cowlick!
My kids put “Gorilla Glue” in my conditioner. You’re the hair genius...what should I do?
What do you think?  Conditioner - or trim the split ends?
Alright - I've been seeing someone else!
That's not what I meant.
I should have thought this through more before getting the weave.
I guess roll reversals don’t reverse gravity.
They call it “hair spray.”
There's enough for the comb-over, but if you want it to look like King Donald's, the first thing we'll have to do is dye it blond.
Let’s upend that sexist fairytale.
And where pray tell is this 'Supercuts' you speak of?
Let's put a different spin on this tale."
Hm, okay - I can work with this.
Hairbrained I may be,
Yet truly long for thee!
I promise it's not a harebrained scheme.
Well now, that's a switch.
This fair maiden thinks ..."Sire, your comb over rivals that of  Master Trump."
Thanks, that's a load off my mind.
Tie me off and repel, Rapunzel!
No, not lavender, I use a rosemary with crushed mint conditioner.
Hey, my eyes are down here!
Do you think it works better down?
Why do you always check for lice, whenever I come over to see you?
Wow! What hold!
Pull harder!
Don’t pull, it’s a wig!
I figured since you could't come down, that maybe you could pull me up.
Pray for tensile strength.
Have you thought this out?
See...I’ll be your equal partner in everything.
How many times do I need to tell you: Hairspray. Not crazy glue.
just a tease
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, make me a man bun.
This isn't how it works. This isn't how any of it works.
Now pull really hard. I'll roll up to you just like a yo-yo.
I’ve never had an hairectal dysfunction problem before ...
My love for you transcends traditional gender roles.
I don't think it was written this way
Okay, come on down!
Let’s switch places and try again.
If I'm honest, these blind dates are usually a let down.
I was thinking the plan was more for me to come up.  But, I can see why you coming down makes more sense.  Let's go with your hair.
Happily ever after defies the laws of gravity.
Trust me, I used the strong hold hair spray.
I'll come back up now so you can go down.
Too bad gravity matters.
Rapunzel, I've figured it out. I should be in the tower and you should be down here.
My new conditioner has extra lift.
No, it does that when I'm nervous too.
My hair isn't all they talk about!
I'm having a really bad hair day.
Keep looking,I put the keys in there myself!
I don’t know. Maybe the Viagra went straight to my man bun.
Go ahead. There’s enough product in it
Would you mind pulling me up?  I'm all about breaking gender norms.
I used super hold gel.
For the hundredth time, Rapunzel, its not a weave!
I know my ends are split! Just pull me up!
I look so much better with my hair up.
Yup, it’s Opposite Day!
I don't think we thought this thru enough.
Just a promise of things to come.
So silky, and no split ends. What's your secret?
Considering how long it took to grow this-- 
Maybe we could have come up with a Plan B
Hey, it makes a killer man-bun
It's not grease. It's body.
So that you may slide down thy golden man bun.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, help me with my man bun!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, it's your turn--pull me up, please!
Things used to be simple. Where did we go wrong?
Once upon a time, when viagra and rogaine were bottled in grog.
Thanks for letting me down easy!
It's called hairspray and trust me, it'll make things so much easier
I thought you said you liked my man-bun?
I flunked physics.
Ohmigod! It's split ends, right?
Well, I must say, getting here was quite a hair-raising experience!
School sent home "the notice."  Please tell me you don't see anything.
Okay, now throw down your hair and I'll check it for split ends!
Are you sure we can't use mine?
I'm no good at climbing, but if you start right now you can make it down to me before the gel dissolves."
It's a Brazilian blow-up.
Wait... What?!
I'm leaving because it's always about you, Rapunzel. Your hair. Your castle tower. But Madame de Pompadour makes me feel like it's okay to be about my hair once in awhile.
You stay there, Melania until you admit it's real!
Just a snip me lady, I have two more stops to make
Trump swore his hairspray would stiffen it sufficiently.
You misunderstood me. I'm just trying to illustrate the concept.
Gel technology has made some incredible advances since you were locked up.
This will be hard to Trump
I figured you would know how to deal with split ends.
This way, you can yank me up or you can climb down.
I applied  on it some of that new stuff they were selling at the pharmacy: Viagrin or something.
I just followed the directions; lather, rinse, repeat.
Split ends!  I don't think so!
I just want to relax and put my hair up.
Chivalry requires that I reciprocate in kind.
Great extensions!
I’ll marry you on several conditions.
Looks like a "good hair day"
Lather, rinse, repeat. almost no one repeats you see.
As above, so below.
Would ya pull me back up? That prince turned out to be a real jerk!
After all these years there's been a change in the script, Rapunzel.  Now you just tie it off up there and slide on down.
Are you sure it said 'Extra Hold' and not just 'Strong'"
I’m you from the future! Don’t wait for a man, you can do it yourself!
Rapunzel,Rapunzel,climb down my hair.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair. Or climb on down mine and we’re off to the faire.
Make haste, the spell is wearing off.
This isn’t the hair to my throne.
I want to be your hairo.
It took an entire Costco bottle of gel, but you can use it to slide down
Trust me, this new hair spray is the best !
It just SOUNDS crazy.
Trust The Gel
What? This is the way the president styles his hair.
By the way, Mrs. Newton just had her baby! His name is Isaac.
My do or yours?
Forsooth, my lady, even in your gentleness with my hair,
I ask you humbly how the hell you got up there
Yep, just slide down. Feet first into the shoes. You got this.
No, I don't know what conditioner my stylist uses...just get down here already!
You're right. The hair gel works like magic.
Well, now you're now the damsel in distressed hair.
I don’t think this is the way this is supposed to go.
What if we turn the tower upside down?
Okay, now apply the conditioner.
Actually, I am a Rastafarian’.
If your cream rinse lasts more than four hours call your doctor immediately.
I forgot to tell you, it's just a wig.
OH, now we like the man bun.....
Will you still love me when I lose it?
Can you just give me a trim, to get rid of the split ends?
Excuse me sir, but I think you've got the story flipped.
There’s no time for braiding. Let’s go!
I don't know ... somehow this just doesn't seem right.
It’s a fairy tale world. No gravity. Pull, Rapunzel, pull. It’ll work.
Split up??? I thought you said "split ends"!
Sorry but I asked the guys to rewrite the story gender-neutral.
I know, I overdid the hairspray again...
Prince, Oh my prince, what conditioner do you use?
Are you sure this is my polling station
The place is a mess, I'll come down instead.
Are you sure this is going to work?
The salon had an amazing deal on extreme hold volumizer.
I'd have been here sooner but I had to sell my horse to pay for all this product.
Come on, Rapunzel, just follow the damn script!
Hurry, I could only arrange for a temporary reversal of Newton's Law.
Trust me, it has enough product in it to hold up a gorilla!
Let's see...I tie this to the bedpost then you climb UP?
Are you sure it's not supposed to be the other way around?
Rapunzel, letteth go of my man bun.
This worked in Hairy Potter
You said, "Your place" so pull me up.
I told you that I wanted to be a full partner in this relationship.
No!  No!  You fasten it first
It's level four, princess-strength.
I said get the mouse not mousse
Always with the pomp and circumstance.
You're messing up my comb over.
Maybe I misunderstood #MeToo.
I used extra-firm gel. Slide down!
It's a new hairspray...slide!
They call it a "comb over".  It's the latest thing!
Well I thought it was worth a shot!
I used the Balm of Gilead.
I hate the man bun
This gender reversal thing is really getting out of hand.
ok ok... but DO NOT forget the scissors
Could you take a little bit off the ends?
The Rogaine worked!
Who's making fun of my comb-over now?
How much longer will it take you to get all the nits out?
Ummm I have a feeling this is not going to work out.
'Hey pull me up, they said Trump is deporting people if they don't donate to his toupee fund !!'
I took off my shoes. Now can I climb up?
Sorry about the split ends
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, do not overestimate the power of gel.
Sure it's sticky. I had to use 100 cans of hairspray to get you out.
It is I, Prince Leznupar...
I put heavy-duty gel on it; you can slide down.
It's NOT the start of a slippery slope!
Can I help it I'm dyslexic.
Aye, I pledge to snake the drains.
Yes! It is I, Leznupar!
Well then, perhaps the other way?
Now we're co-dependent.
Be careful. The mousse hasn't hardened yet.
Ride Sally......ride!
Oh Prince Hairy, where hast thou been?
It's not punk. It's post punk.
I'm defying stereotypes that are repressing women.
I think it’s on backwards
I’m trying to get it up
Pull me up and we can plan your escape.
I'm excited to see you too!
Rapunzel — a postmodern reinterpretation.
OK, I'll pick up a stiffer hair spray and be back tomorrow.
I hope this works.  I used all the gel in the entire kingdom!
It’s fine! Just hold on tight and jump.
I'm not going to be able to tie your man bun from here
If we are really doing gender role reversal, shouldn't I be the one up there?
Of course I shampooed when I showered!  Why?
Trust me Rapunzel, I used all the cans of super-hold spray net in the kingdom.
Split ends is the least of my problems.
No, I don't see any split ends...
Do you still have the instructions?
It took all morning to fit it into this hat.
I don't care how the story goes.  Get me the hell out of this hellhole and pull me up!
Coconut oil, twice a week.
I  liked your Afro better.
We Millennials are always grappling with gender identity.
Brother, this is looking grim.
Hurry, the Barber of Seville is on his way!
Time for your hair raising rescue.
I probably should have warned you about my comb over.
Can you help with my man bun?
I put a lot of product in
It’s like the therapist said: I need to be an equal partner in this relationship.
Yes, but it's all business in the front.
I figured it's time for you to see my place.
Ok, I admit it was a combover, but I deny using tan-in-a-can.
No...I said "I thought you'd have more flair."
Trading the ladder for magic beans seemed like a good idea at the time. You know how I get when I'm hungry.
Long hairs, no stairs.
What do you mean, I got it wrong?
Look, the temp agency was only so specific.
I thought you'd appreciate my nod to gender equality.
Pull me back in. Election season somehow hasn't ended!
Larry's comb-over proven ineffective...again
You wanted a hair-raising experience?
It appears we've elevated the form over the substance.
They said you knew everything about split ends.
Donald, Donald, 
Let up your hair!
I know, nothing but split ends. Could you throw down some conditioner?
Oh Rapunzel, let down your hair trimmer.
We seriously need to start putting in staircases
I haven't got it quite worked out, yet.
You know what?  I can free climb this.
Leznuper, slide down my hair.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your conditioner.
Don't worry, Rap. The President has suspended gravity.
I guess the man bun doesn't seem so funny now does it!
Or,I can put it up in a man bun and you can bounce down!
Rufus, Rufus, let down your manbun!
I spent so much time growing my hair
that I forgot what I wanted to ask you
You did ask for a locksmith, didn't you?
Your Beauty makes my hair stand on end
Trump does not know what a real bad hair day is like!
I used a portland cement mousse last night...I think it should be set by now.
one of us is upside down
Well you couldn't climb down a man-bun.
Pull me up, Buttercup!
I'm afraid of heights.  Could you come down here instead of my going up there?
It took over 15 years for us to achieve hair equality.
My lawyer says this way I have an airtight defense of this being consensual.
Repuns-PULL!!!
Hey, if I can do it so can you.
As a matter of fact, I did use a little too much hair gel this morning. Why do you ask?
A man bun if you may, my fair maiden
Hello fair maiden I am Prince Minoxidil.
I know mullets are out - do you want to be saved or not?
I swear it is my hair! You have an issue with orange?
Are you crazy -- you walk on air -- who
walks on hair?
Just hang on real tight and I'll get a running start.
Don't believe everything you read.
See? And you thought my man-bun looked weird.
If you take off your top I think I can get it to stand up a little bit better.
Ugh! Split ends!
Gender norms exist for a reason, Rapunzel.
It's 'do or dye!
Prince, Prince, throw up your hair!
Ok,I took off my shoes,now pull me up before the caravan gets here!
Whaddya mean, "too much gel"??
When you said you had some hair-raising news I didn’t think this is what you meant.
I only have hair for you.
Yes, I want you to run your thighs through my hair"
Okay, this time pull me up slower and I’ will muffle my screams with my shirt
This will probably be miss reported by the fake news media.
Mom, I swear I'll come back.  Just let me go to the barber.
I call it 'The Reverse Rapunzel.'
Who's Repunzel?
Just hold on tight, and I'll pull you down very slowly.
You'll have to pull me up...
If you can't pull me up, let down your hair!
Isn't this supposed to be the other way around?
There is bubble gum in your hair.
All things considered, Princess Rapunzel found the whole gender equality thing a bit of a climbdown...
That's the worst comb over I've ever seen
I'm not just a member ... I'm the president!
Trust me.  I used a whole can of hairspray
...and that's my hair-raising story.
I think something got lost in translation.
Mega-sculpt extreme max-power hold . . . yes, of course it's safe.
I can't go back to knight school until ALL the lice are gone
Do you like my comb-over now?
Rescue? I was just going to ask how you deal with your split ends!
No, No!! I don’t climb up, you slide down!
Repunzel, Repunzel, let up my hair!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, enough with the gel. I've taken off my shoes, let me in, what the hell?
Dyslexia is a terrible thing.
You really have no contact with the outside world, right?
Don't be jealous.  Just Jump!
Well, I guess this could work, but can you really pull me up?
Is it because I used your shampoo?
Of course, your endorsement of RapunGel (TM) will be indispensable.
I fear you may just be using me for my comb-over.
Are you sure this is right?
On hell no
Rapunzel: I don't think this story will have a happy ending.
I found some hair gel from the 80s.
It's called hairspray. You climb down.
Of course I was gone a long time, wait, what was the plan again?
Do you think I use too much product?
Hair goes down, too??
I really think you could just jump down.
I was optimistic until I saw the split ends.
I was yelling for a long ladder not a long comb over.
It’s climate change
Yes, I seriously used shampoo and conditioner this time. Jeez!
Don't leave me stranded down here.
It's a long story...
You can't pull me up? Why are you telling me now?
Surely, you don't expect me to climb down those split ends!
There has to be an easier way to sneak back into the house.
I found that my rescue techniques were being limited by gender identity stereotypes.
No, it's not a comb-over; it's a comb-up.
No, you let your hair down
Yes , it was hard to get it up there
Viagra?  No.  Why?
Mine hipster man bun hath come undone; does this foretell the end of our bawdy fun
Um, no Repunzel.  I do not want you to pull me up.
It's a weave.
I can show you results from other pharmaceutical samples, too.
I fear my split ends are pretty Grimm...
It's called a 'quiff', actually"
It does smell good and it’s silky smooth and volumizing, but did the spray can mention anything about extra strong hold?
Sorry Rapunzel, but your hair is a bit of a let-down.
Rupunzel... pull up my hair!
No, fool! I, Rapunzel, am supposed to lower my hair to thee.
I have only my undying love and the best comb-over in the history of the world to offer you. Pull me up!
Sorry, I couldn't find a ladder.
Gee, your hair smells terrific!
You said you hated the man bun.
That's not what I meant when I said I wanted to go down on your erection.
Well, the bottle said it would strengthen my hair... so you should be okay?
Trust me. Once I license this product, you will never want for anything.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, pull me up there!
Just tie if off and slide down.  There's no reason to check for nits.
Oh, oh.  I think you have lice.
It’s 2018; I’ll save you.
So I used all your gel, now slide like a fire-pole.
I wanted to wear the hair in the relationship
Okay, now pull hard!
Are you sure I can’t take the stairs?
I told you we had something in common.
Trump taught me how.
It's not going to scale itself sweetheart...
Wait a minute.  I don't think this'll work.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but how much hairspray is in this?
Trust me-I am your long-lost brother.
Ok, great! But now how do I get down?
I tried a man bun--but it just wasn't me.
Just be careful of the static electricity when you slide down.
It’s s pompadour, hurry and slide down before the mousse wears off.
I thought you knew how to make a bun?
Hurry, before male pattern baldness begins.
It'll work! I used six cans of hairspray.
I couldn't find a ladder
It's called a POTUS cut.
OK, I understand - but I still have to charge you for the service call.
Careful coming down, dear.
Is this gonna hurt?
It's okay. My first wife let me down, too.
Alternative facts!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, you are the only one
for whom I would undo my mighty man bun.
Look, I said I was hair for you.
You just couldn’t let me have the spotlight even this one time, could you!
In an alternate universe far far away and long long ago
Wait! I'll climb up there and you come down here!
Trust me, this way is easier.
The length to which you would go to prove a point
I don't think this is how this is how the story is supposed to go.
Quickly, princess! Climb down my extensions ladder.
What do you mean "too greasy"?
You know I want to be with you, but can’t I take the stairs!
It's Aqua Net- trust me, it'll hold.
Rupunzel, Rupenzel, should I get bangs?
I'm looking for an equal partnership.
This is as close as you're getting, bub. No staircase means no staircase.
I'm afraid we can't do anything with it - I just washed it.
I don't think this is what they meant by equal opportunity.
Okay! Now you do it!
Hurry this hair gel only lasts 15 minutes.
I told you that you needed to read the directions!
Ron Punzel  was Ra's brother. Ron was not famous like his sister.
See, I told you my man bun was a good idea.
It's called Lacquer, but never mind that now.
You need a little more product.
Rapunzel! No need to muss your hair!! 
   My pomaded pompadour is guaranteed to hold up to 100 pounds, so come on down!
So, what... do I just shimmy down?
Rapunzel, this is so woke.
I went to Trump's doctor.
We need to get some stairs, I'm getting a perm next Thursday.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, WTF!
'Tis true, fair maiden ! The witches have cursed me. But the liar curse shall only affect a descendant a thousand years from now in a land far far away!
Listen, I think we can get this to work if I just get enough hairspray.
I think your boyfriend is getting suspicious.
Why, yes. As a matter of fact I did come from Australia.
Mmmm some split ends but otherwise very nice hair!
Yes, it’s all proportional.
Yank once for 'Yes,' twice for 'Come back after the midterms.'
There's no more gel in the kingdom, my lady, but your slide is ready.
Cinderella?
I'm afraid of heights.
Too much conditioner?
When I find a tower with plumbing, I'll come back for you.
Oh, honey you need to touch up those roots.
Do you think this will cover up my bald spot?
I told you, i wanted to be on top this time.
you really should do something for these split ends...
See?  I AM a sensitive new age guy
I think it's time for an elevator.
It's blue, Mom. That's how kids are wearing it now.
Don't worry about the split ends, it'll hold.
Oh Donald! Aren't you afraid this comb-over will result in another cover-up?
Now that’s what I call an up-do!
Don't worry, the hairspray canister guaranteed an extra-firm hold.
Climb on. I used extra hold hair gel.
Won't you just try sliding down it? It's got to be easier than all that climbing up I've done for you.
Donald this comb-over is not going to hold  me no matter what you say !
This comb-over is all the rage.  Even the King wears one.
I call it the Dippity-Do rescue.
Now ratchet me up on your spindel.
Is it a deal-breaker?
More product?
It cost a fortune for the mousse.
It's sprayed with 'Extra Hold' just slide down.
Can you spare some conditioner, m'lady?
Oh, leznupaR.
I'd like to have it short around the ears, and short at the back. But not too short.
Can you do a man bun?
Something doesn' t feel right here!
Yes, mine's a comb-over, now show me yours
Of course you can pull it off!
Thank goodness combovers are still in style
Stop being so nit-picky and slide down already!
Your combover isn't fooling anyone.
It took a lot of hair-gel, but I think it'll hold you.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, hold my toupee"
Please forgive me, I’m having a really bad hair day.
We always go to your place, let' switch it up!
Call me but love, and I will shear this mullet.
Hmmm.  Can't climb down this one - the split ends will kill me.
It is your choice: slide down, or pick me up
Remember to lift with your legs!
Hm.. I'm gonna need a bit more hair spray to feel safe
Let's try reverse psychology.
It only works in Disney movies.
Actually, it's a transplant
It took years to grow it this long, yes. That’s how serious I am about buying your apartment.
Hurry! Male pattern baldness could set in at any moment!
Yeah, yeah, I know. I overdid it with the Rogaine.
This won't work.  It's too hair brained.
Comb over and see me sometime!
Climb down and join me. I need you. Together we can make the Kingdom Great Again!
Make haste, the potion is wearing off.
Product.
Hurry!  I'm not sure how long I can maintain this . . .
Well one of us has to change.
Do I have your permission to man-splain?
Wow, you did that with just hairspray!?
Love is....Negotiating the ups and downs...
Just shut-up and pull me up!!
Let me make a reverse hitch
I can shinny down the drainpipe instead.
Reverse engineering
Thanks for the lift.
Sure - you’re hair today, but what about tomorrow?
Are my split ends really the problem here?
Its a paradox.
I told you I was a stand-up guy!
'I'm getting to the roots of the patriarchy.'
It’s just that I’m aftaid of heights.
Okay, great. But if they made a birth control pill for men, would you take it?
They said you could help me work this into a man bun.
No, wait! It’s a weave!
Can you braid it?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel slide down my long hair
All I had to do was mix my Rogaine and Viagra together, I found out they were both un-taxed so I saved a bundle
We can talk about the split ends after I get up.
Don’t worry, I’ve thought this through, I’ll just come to you.
I suppose this is my #MeToo moment?
Hair today; we could be gone tomorrow.
Do you think I used enough gel?
I knew you'd be hair for me.
Honey, I know I’m Rapunzel.... but I still think we should invest in an elevator.
Mom threw me out, can I stay here?
You know, there are other ways of getting my attention.
What do you think? Is it lice?
It’s called hairspray
How long has it been like this? I don’t know about the Greenies, but the blue pill label suggest after 4 hours, contact a Phsycian.
I don't know either! I asked for a bob and I left with extensions.
The split ends are my biggest problem at this point.
If I can do it you can do it!
Anti-gravity shampoo.  Works pretty well.
The times, they are a changin’.
I believe in fluid gender roles.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, can you frost my tips?
I hope this Viagra works
I think we can make it work.
They say you're the best in the kingdom, so just take a little bit off the top.
I'm telling you, it's not a weave!
Now we'll see if this new hair gel really works or not!
Try to be careful.....I don't want a hairline fracture.
Pull up for more body.
Love me, love my combover.
You have no idea how I longed for you.
I can't tell if this is a good hair day or a bad hair day?
All I had to do was adapt the king's comb-over and hairspray technique. Now hook it over the rail and slide down--carefully.
Dost thou see any split ends?
This isn’t what I meant when I was talking about equality, Greg.
Alright, climb down.
I call it my rope-a-dope.
Quick, before the wind picks up!
oh honey we have to do something about those split ends
Talk about an updo!
Don’t worry about hurting me. Just start pulling me up and I’ll be there in no time.
Hold tight, I’m climbing up.
Gel molds it, spray holds it.
I did my best to let you down gently.  Run Darling run....
While it is somewhat trite, I think a ladder would be preferable.
I'm guessing you preferred my man bun about now.
'Ground-up' has replaced 'top-down' as the latest rescue theory.
I won't be the one saving you - I'm the one from Tinder.
i know hair and this is not hair
I don't think taking my shoes off will matter that much if you're measuring my height like that.
Are you dislexic?
Hurry, hang tight, I'll pull you down.
I used the entire bottle of hair gel."
Esoterically speaking it's either a metaphor, juxtapostion or an oxymoron!
Don't worry I used a lot of hairspray.
I know,but we are doing a different play.
Stop Nagging! I'll Condition It When I  Get Home!
Bishop takes queen
'What the hell is in your shampoo?'
Okay, just take a little off the top!
I'm here to rescue you from cis gender.
They didn't ask what the extensions were for?
It's OK to climb down - trust me!
That dragon-gel mousse is unbelievable!
It's high rise volumizing shampoo plus sculpting gel.  Hold on.
Buzz me up?
Do you see any split ends?
I said, give me a HEADS up.
Whar is your solution for split ends?
My fair princess, let down MY hair.
There's enough product in there for you to slide down.
Trust me. It's gelled pretty good.
Don't worry.   There is enough hair gel to hold you.
I told you: Pantene and hair gel go a long way.
This way you can be down a lot faster "
Butch wax, circa 1954, is great stuff.
Wait - Which one of us was supposed to grow hair?
Are you absolutely absolutely sure that you want dreadlocks?
Enough with your kvetching 'bout the texture - am I coming up or not?
I can’t believe how much he cut off… I specifically asked for a trim!
Hurry up... the hair gel won't stay stiff forever
Will it hold you or do I need more gel?
A bad hair day solved a fairy tale romance.
Keep Looking.  The hacksaw is next to the barrette.
Well not exactly what I had in mind but if you have enough product we can make it work.
Rapunzel please let me save you, it's just a man bun!
My love, if this doesn't hold, we'll try another brand of gel.
Another bad hair day?
Okay, I admit it.  I’m the one who’s been using your shampoo.
Just climb down. It's an extra-firm spray.
"It's just until I can find a new place...and I'll split the utilities with you."
So, it's a comb-over. What do you want, yellow?
We are made for each other. Just think of our children.
We got the wrong script.  It is supposed to be the other way around.
This me too thing isn’t working out very well for us ...
If I turn around, you can hook it on the balcony.  I used quite a bit of hairspray.
.raih nedlog ruoy nwod leznupaR, leznupaR
So why do you need to pull me up there again?
Next time we can use your hair.
Forget it, Rapunzel, this is never going to work. Why don’t you use the elevator!
This is my poor attempt at gender equality rescue.
Hey, everyone deserves a bad hair day!
Surely there's an easier way up -Stairs perhaps?
No Punzle, let down YOUR hair.
Just a trim, please.
I've decided to meet you half way
I may have used a little more hair spray than I intended.
My man-bun will save you!
Rapunzel, you can stop examining it so closely.  I'm sure it's long & stiff enough for you now.
I'm just saying, it's not you - it's me...
Hurry! The hairspray won’t last forever!
My second wish was for hair gel.
Don't worry, there's enough hair gel to support you.
You should see my roots.
Did I mention I tend to be a little competitive?
Did  I use too much hairspray?
It is only fair, you climb down my hair.
OMG!  You've got split ends!
I've been conditioning myself for our first date.
Too many split ends. Next!
This new styling gel is frankly upstanding!
It's all in the conditioner.
Tie them together and we will be close to whatever Trump has going on!
we  are going to need a lot more  hair spray for this to work.
Let go of my hair Rapunzel, you need to grow your own.
What do you mean you're out of hairspray?
It's a very robust hair product.
Lice has been going around, I just want to make sure
It really works!  Let me come up and show you.
More hairspray,and then I can shinny down!
Wait!!  This is not how it is supposed to work!
Seriously, what am I supposed to do with this, braid it?
I thought you said
"Deny thy barber
and reuse thy mane."
I call this my "Reverse Rapunzel..."
I think we must be doing this backwards.
The updrafts are killer around here.
Now how are you getting down?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, ouch!
What do you mean hairspray was not invented yet?
What happened to my prince with a buzz cut?
Even if it is shinier and more manageable than yours, we can still make this work.
I keep telling you: I'm not Donald Trump!
Pull me up, it’s terrible out here
OK then,lets try plaiting some rungs into it.
Slide down, I’ll catch you.
I would’ve gotten here faster but I was getting my roots done.
I don't think this revision will work.
It's Leznuper - why do you ask?
Just go with it.  I've been working on this for years!
It’s been really humid lately.
Just tell me it’s not another gray
What do you mean you bobbed your hair?
Isn't there an easier way to dismantle gender norms?
Did I mention I liked your hair better when it was longer?
It's the latest style; it's called a comb over.
You've messed up my man bun!
OK. Now climb down.
It takes forever to dry, but I just love the way it makes me feel.
I love what you did to your hair
It has both style AND function!
The History of the Man-Bun, Part 1
I think I read Rapunzel's instructions upside-down.
The trick is you don't 'repeat'.
I never thought I would ever say "Combover to the rescue!"
Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Do I have split ends??"
I haven't found anyone else who does my hair like you.
Yes, I used a leave in conditioner."
Ivanka quit messing around I need my hair to be perfect for the press conference.
No, no, no, Amazon! I ordered this in blonde.
Try not to undo my comb-over as you climb down.
We will need to check your roots before you can come in.
I understand what a top-knot is, but how does that help me?
Trust me: it's better this way
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Go ahead, climb down, I used a whole bottle of freezing gel.
Oh, another grey one!
'Well Trump liked it...'
What say tonight we go out?
3D printers made my modern day fairy tale come true.
Castle Cuts
“Just a little off the top”
Seriously.   My name is Leznupar
Sorry, It's a Preexisting Condition.
How much more gel do you think it needs?
Is that... is that hair gel?
I think I'd prefer it if you just wrapped me around your little finger.
I really dislike opposites day.
Quick! The hair spray is wearing out!
My toilet drains clockwise also.
Can I come up? I'm trying to get back to my roots.
Alright, now jump!
I hope the Grimm Brothers  hear about this.
All this was a comb over? Forget it - the wedding is off!
If you can't go low, I'll go high.
Go ahead! Climb down!
You should try something for these split ends.
The pony tail is so yesterday.  Can you do a buzz cut with a man bun?
So yeah I'm kind of a feminist.
'Tis easy, just use your winch, wench.
Of course I can swing. Can you keep time?
Transpunzel, Transpunzel! Let up your hair!
This hair boner wan't last forever. So keep stroking it or hop on it now before it goes limp.
Thy name is Prince Harry
I thought we could try my place this tim.
It's not my choice, the king has decreed comb overs
If you didn’t get a haircut we would be out of here a couple of hours ago
I'm guessing these aren't the only locks between me and freedom.
Would you repeat the question.
I'll get pregnant for you too.
Any day, now, I'm out of Rogaine.
So whaddya say, can you fix those split ends for me?
Let me move in; otherwise my parents will make me get a haircut.
Thy love and my product are strong enough to bring us together
I said comb it not climb it!
I'm your knight in shining, tangle-free, luscious hair!
LIMERICK: She was stuck in a tower...with no bathroom or shower...Her beau from Assisi...His hair, mighty greasy...And the bouquet of their love was sweet..also sour.
This is different, right?
If we tell it how it happened, nobody will believe us.
For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Just give me a light trim.
OK   I will use the conditioner  and  comeback
Well, if you really believed in equality you'd be the one up here, not me.
Do you think I should do a man bun?
Is this what you call reverse psychology?
How about we try the trickle-down theory?
Ohhh...I thought I heard you said "grow out your hair"
Just trim a little off the end, please.
Okay- now on the count of 3, pull.
Be back with some sheets.
Oh, and Dad says hi.
#yetoo
Careful on the split ends.
All I’m saying is, Ashley, this looks gay as hell.
You are right not a single split end.  When my father lets me out I am switching to your stylist.
So if we do move in together, 
we can each come and go as the other pleases.
Stupid cartoonist!
Rapunzel, Rap..... wait a minute, you’re
messin w the story line here
Quickly, pull me up! It's no better out here!
I'll never make it down with these split ends."
We can stay at your place, right?
Sorry. First rule of Hair Club for Men...
I didn't want to be a letdown.
But our children would have split ends.
i misunderstood...
The reader is probably dyslexic.
It's like the Indian rope trick, but with hair.
I need it this long to comb over my bald spot.
Too much Viagra.
Surely it's self-evident that liberation can be most effectively created by a supply-side rescue policy.
I’m trying to be more socially concsioucous-this time, why don’t you climb down my hair?
I'm just going to let you down again.
Role reversal exercises give me a headache.
Thou may cometh back once thou hath conditioned.
I would wax eloquent, but I used all the wax on my hair.
It happened after I read James Joyce
On this planet gravity works a little differently Sweetheart
I think this is enough to buy a ladder!
I think gravity is against us with this idea.
Of course our story no longer makes sense! The gender-neutral police win again!
And this gel comes in strawberry scented, too!
We're going to need more Gel if this is gonna work!
The subway must have been brutal getting here
If you're not going to pull me up, I may as well get a Bob.
You really get me.
Don't worry, it's 'extra strong hold' hair gel.
Now pull me up, please.
I don't want to come up that badly ...
We do everything the other way ‘round when we visit Down Under.
I might have overdone the Rogaine, Rapz...
I beseech thee - less gel, more conditioner!
Rampunzel, Rampunzel, climb down my hair !
I put a lot of gel on it! Now slide on down!
Oh yeah, ever since people heard about you it’s been all the rage
It's a Rapunzel comb-over.
I'm a feminist
I play for the Lions.  Everyone pledged not to cut their hair until we win a Super Bowl.
Because, fair damsel, I've not been to the gym of late.
Just help me with my split ends, will ya?
Can I rescue you now?
You didn't specify that it had to be blond!
Still needs a little more gel.
Reverse-engineering at its worst.
How? A LOT of gel.
Impressive locks on the door too.
Please, please, remember this time to slide around to the back side.
I told you I’m afraid of heights!
I did NOT use your conditioner
But 'Rapunzel' is so cliché. Have you ever seen 'There's Something About Mary'?
You can climb down to me now, thanks to my new Oh-So-Stiff Hair Gel.
Yikes!  I can see this is going to be hair-raising experience.
I finally saved enough money for extensions.
No, I haven't seen your scrunchie.
So what if you found a gray hair?
Your place or mine?
#You too?
See? No more man bun. Now will you date me?
It took 100 cans of hairspray
Yes, your new conditioner smells great—now what?
Upsy-Daisy.
No, no. This'll work. Just tie it on to your hair and slide down.
Quick, pull me up! The patriarchy is coming.
Tbank God! You landed on your feet, with hair to spare!
It’s a jojoba extract.
Rapunzel,  I got your note, how'd you know I'm dyslexic?
It's even worse than that. My hands have turned into carrots.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel. This is just another hair-brained idea of mine.
Shaping my hair into a ladder would have involved a lot more hairspray.
Pull me up.  Then you can shinny on down.
While the gender flip is admirable, the carbon footprint of the hairspray involved is intolerable.
There's nothing to fear, I used ultra strong styling mousse!
Winch. With an i.
Don’t blame me Rapunzel. Have you never seen ‘There’s Something About Mary’?
Grab on, I'll pull you down!
Just a bit off the top and part on the right please.
I'd like to submit a caption but I'm afraid it would be repundant.
Are  you SURE this is hair gel?
I offer you these magic shoes - and my man bun.
Pretty good for a comb-over don’t you think?
No, my name is Ralph  and  I have  friend with a ladder.
I can't weave a ladder out of this bird's nest. I told you to use conditioner!
Give it a try, what have you got to lose?
See Rapunzel, you don't always have to let down your hair
Is this not what you meant by role play?
Has the role of bean stalk been filled in this tale too?
This isn't going to work. I'm calling for the guy from Lyft."
I haven't got time for a shampoo and cut. Can you just give me a quick blow job?
The Rogaine Stuff Really Does Work!
...and THAT is why you need a home security system.
Come see my tower. It's better than yours. Much better. And bigger too. Much bigger!
You know, I think this gives me an idea!
Yes, I know it's a reverse situation--but this is the age of Me, Too.
On the way here I  had the most hair- raising experience with some witch!
WOW! Absolutely no split-ends!
Oh, nothing. Just two hogsheads of gel and a fortnight at the bellows.
I also cook and clean.
I'm donating it to Locks Above. They specialize in star-crossed maidens."
Don't worry Rapunzel.  We've done this before.
Enough hairspray and you can slide out.
Just a taper fade and thinning please"
I know! I know! Too much hair spray
I knew this hairstyle would come in handy for something.
Who lets down the hair in this relationship?
After her first marriage failed, Rapunzel conceded that it was not such a bad idea to marry up.
Woman! Damn! I already told you I checked for lice. Now get a good grip and jump!
I was going for a look of equality.
Don’t worry. I used extra hold hair spray.”
You ever use a fireman's pole?
This long hair idea is not working. I'm coming back with a Cherry Picker.
Explain to me how this happened, again
Can you braid it for me?
It looks like a hairline fracture.
I thought I'd save you the trouble of letting down your hair.
Hold it tight and I will be right up.
I don't even know your last name.
Hair Club for Men. Now, pull!
Just drop it Hermelda, it's not going to work out.  But we can still be friends"
I thought we could be friends with fringe benefits.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, are you sure you know how to make a man-bun?
Great! Now just climb down!
too much gel?
You do know how to tie a slip knot, right?
I'm having a rescue hair day
What do you mean, I need to use more conditioner?
Would you believe the impact this man bun has had on my job hunt?
Trust me! Viagra hardens hair too.
...as you can see the wig has minimal structural integrity thus making any rescue attempt futile but boy you should see the look on your face!
This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you"
Quick, pull me up, I don't know how long the hair straightener will last
I used  thick  #10 hair spray so you can slide down.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let's not split hairs over who goes first
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, haul me up by my hair. I'm tired of waiting for you to let yours down.
I can give you my hairdresser's info.
And you need a hair extension why?
I don't know, my mother's father is bald.
Make haste! Tomorrow I'm getting it washed."
Get on it quick! Hair today gone tomorrow?
I am not sure if I am comfortable with the feminist approach to this....
The stylist told me an "up-do" was "hep."
HAIR YOU GO COMB ON DOWN !
What can I say? I lost the House, so...you pull me up this time.
Symbolically, it just makes more sense.
Let’s try you letting down your hair.
'But it's more than a man bun, I think of it as my personal flexible hair-based escape aid.'
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, leggo me 'air!
I spent a fortune on hair gel, but you're worth every penny.
It’s called ‘gel’.
Thanks, I'll call you.
Bet the comb-over isn't so funny now!
I told you the contrete hair gel would work
I know it's long enough! But I think I'm supposed to be up there & you down here!
It's my best natural extension but the hemp is very popular too.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, give me my hair
Does your dowry include scissors?
You need to use more conditioner.
No worries, the significance of gravity is greatly diminished given new market conditions...
Would you be willing to come down?
Fear not fair damsel, for I am Leznupar!
You have no idea how much hair gel it takes to get this look..."
Maybe we should try switching this up a bit.
Just a light trim, please!
Do you know how to tie a bowline?
We're going to have to break up.  I can't afford the hair gel.
You're not going anywhere!!
Yep. You definitely have nits.
The carpet deos not match the drapes, I promise.
Hey  lady. You wrote the note.
Is this what you meant by #MeToo?
Careful, it’s slippery.
Split ends? Now you're just splitting hairs.
I would’ve preferred a ladder.
I guess I let my comb-over get out of control.
Let's do an inch off the bottom...and I've always wondered how I'd look with bangs.
So when the humidity rolls in, my curls will shoot me straight up to you.
It began growing when I stated taking the ED medication.
You never let up....
Tie it off, but bring scissors when you come down.
I told him ‘easy on the product’.
I still struggle with the cowlick. Any advice?
Why did you go first?
Everybody says I should cut it, but sometimes it comes in handy.
We're lucky I'm having a bad hair day today.
Whoa, this is all wrong!
Just braid it!
I swear it's not a toupee.  Pull it!
Thanks, it’s so hard to get to those out of reach tangles
OK, the prince sent you; but couldn't he have given you a ladder?
I have traveled far to get your opinion on conditioners
Are you sure you read the instructions?
Stop! You’re making my hair stand on end!
What do you think--crown braid or messy bun?
Supporting a princess's right to let down her own hair or take his.
A little off the top would get rid of those split ends!
It's the new Rogaine — pretty good results, eh . . . ?
I thought I'd 'let up' MY hair for a change...
Good call with the hair spray! I’ll slide right down.
Is Rapunzel home?
Now, just do a reverse wrap braid and start climbing down.
I read that reversing gender norms would help save you from the patriarchy.
What do you mean it's not what I expected? They're extensions.
Hurts doesn't it?
It's called "a reverse bob."
Lean in!
3.	“I really killed it at the royal mullet contest.”
Some of these fractured fairytale s just don't work.
Stop upbraiding me, I'm returning the slippers I borrowed.
I’m not only president, I’m also a member!
Let's trade places.
We really ought to get the witch some help for her dyslexia
Rapunzel, let down your flex hold gel.
There’s a reason we’re not together.
RAPUNZEL, YOU NEVER LET UP!!
Not so hard, baby! Your coif may be magic, but this one's a weave.
Now pull me up so I can put it back in a man ban!
That's right...my name is Leznupar.
Do you know you've got split ends?
I would have been here sooner, but it grows ever so slowly.
I was going for a Conan O'Brien look.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Pull up my hair!
Kids, do not try this trick at home.
Thank goodness for the comb over.
This time I used a shitload of gel.
I never said retying my man bun would be easy.
I refuse to be rescued by someone with better hair than me!
Your hair !!!!, Why have you cut your hair !!!!
I think I used too much mousse.
It's solid - I was in an Elvis contest.
They call it gel....
I told you the jojoba oil would work!
Hair up. Hair down. My place next time.
I just washed my hair--are your hands clean?
I love it when you do that to me!
Something’s different this time...
The name is Leznupar, known to be Rapunzel in reverse.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, you simply must tell me who does your hair.
It looks like I have been reverse engineered into this fairy tale.
I bought it from this nice troll under a bridge.
Well! A little dab will DO you!
Honestly, tell me, do you like me for me or is it something else?
I know we've had communication issues, but this is ridiculous
Good thing you're open!  I want to perm my hair for a new look.
Technically you will be sliding up
Can you pull me up and then put it into a messy man bun for me?
This could hurt.  Can't you just beam me up?
I think we're going to need more than product to get you out of there....
May I, m'love, suggest another use for my comb-over.
There always something about you, Mary.
You know I’m a Renaissance man.  I share the load.
I won’t fall for you!
Hurry up, I'm almost 40.
Thank goodness you're so good at making it harder.
It's extra strong hold, but it's slippery so hold on tight.
No, I'm not going to scale the wall while you hang on to my hair.
Sorry, My Lady.  All I heard was 'extension'."
Just a little more hairspray and you'll make it!
I was told you do perms.
Its safe to use it as an escape slide, I used lots of "product".
Please help - ivory towers are the only safe places left.
You have split ends!
Do I have any hangups?
Haven't you had a bad hair day before?
It’s a New Wave rescue.
Sorry, yeah, I did forget about gravity.
U i evol,leznupaR
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my hair so I can make a man-bun!
Now do you think the multiverse theory is true?
I was trying to grow a ladder but this was the best I could do on short notice.
When you told me that you have enough to take me away from all of this, I didn’t think you were talking about your hair.
I didn't do all of this just for you to complain about my split ends.
Me, too, Rapunzel
It's a perm.
It's called hair product. You can slide right down!
The difference is I use styling mousse not hair softener.
Okay Rapunzell.  If you wont let down your hair then pull me up.
The Airbnb requirement said it needed to be at least 20 feet long
This is our most cost effective residential fibre optic offer.
Yep! You definitely have split ends!
I tried using the conditioner this time.
If you want I could switch places with you.
I thought it was time for a little role-reversal...
Don’t change a hair for me.
'You mean the split ends are a turn off ?
Well that's my man bun
Looks like physics wasn’t one of your electives.
Do you want the  Marge Simpson hairdo?
I know it defies all earthly logic, it’s Trump’s gel.  But it’ll hold!
I'm all for up-ending gender norms.
See if you can braid it into treadlocks.
You expect me to climb down this?
I knew this cowlick would be perfect.
Cut my hair? I'm waiting till marriage
Can I come up or do you want to come down?
I don’t think it matches my drapes.
For with none other, m’lady, do I so gel.
YOU'VE GOT SOME UPDRAFT  HERE!
I didn't have time to wash it, I've been in Florida working the recount.
I guess it was a good idea to try the 'up-do' after all.
Some people say I am overcompensating for other, um, shortfalls, but all that is perfectly fine, believe me.
It's full of hair clips.... I'll bleed to death on the way down!
Herbalife made it happen. Ask me how.
I discovered this great gel.  You're safe to slide down.
I told you it would unravel Donald!
Split ends? I'd rather stay up here for eternity.
Pardon my dragon lick.
My hair-raising encounter with the witch resulted in a shellacking.
I’d really like to be in any other fairy tale. Can I speak to HR?
Do you have any conditioner?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, I’m confused about my gender identity.
Yeah, I have some hair gel... why do you ask?
Wait!  Wait!  Let's talk this through one more time!
You see, my darling? I’ve grown.
Pull me up.  It's revisionist fairy tale hair growth.
So, I'm thinking a bit too much hair spray.
You would not believe how much gel this took
Come on, it’ll work!
Get Ready, one, two, three, PULL!
you are going to
be fine. i used crazy glue on it
Rapunzel, honey, would you pull me up already?
It better work. I used the strongest gel on the market!
But do we have enough in common?
OMG tell me this is a hair extension.
Is thouest up for the old switcheroo?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, send down your detangler.
All I know is it has something to do with Title IX.
I was looking for a new stylist and you came highly recommended.
These final rehearsals never start well...
Go ahead, it's safe . . . I used a whole tube of Got2b glued.
I hope I put enough gel in it
You want me to climb on a Trump Vine?  Do I look that desperate!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel...quit teasing me.
Maybe y7ou've heard of me? I'm Rapunzelot."
When you write this up, could I ask for one minor change?
Based on Rapunzel and on the laws of physics, I think we're doing this wrong.
I told you it was too much mousse!
Talk about role reversals!
They're extensions but still under warranty."
My barber died.
I told you I'd find a way -- tie it to something and climb down
Should I wear my hair up or down for the wedding?
good thing I didn't take 6 inches off the top
Hair straightener and a volumizing shampoo.
It looks nicer when it is parted in the middle.
I'm sorry, but it took awhile to grow it out.
Sorry. Our volunteer fire department has had some cutbacks.
What it lacks in style it makes up for in strength.
What did you think it was?
Leznuper, Leznuper, let go of my hair.
Eugene, Eugene let up your hair!
Keep pulling.  We gotta hurry, your dad will be home soon"
It's grey! Do you have a younger brother?
You must do something about these split ends!
Just take a little off the bottom.
Wait! That's not my real hair! I'm wearing extensions!
Repunzel, gravity will not be working in our favor, I fear.
Sorry... not enough room here for us both.
. . . then you . . . slide down to . . . me.  Umm, wait a minute.  Something's goofed-up here.
i'm just here to borrow your scissors
You said we always go to my place. I’m willing to compromise, babe.
Oh no, Rapunzel! When I said “Let your hair down,” I expected you would leave it attached to your head.
Consider it as an exercise in gender equality.
What, you were hoping for a blue wave?
You need more conditioner.
Pictured is the first receipt printed by CVS.
It's not the way they did it in the version of Rapunzel that I'm familiar with.
Seriously...a man-bun !
I'm sorry, but they were out of viagra
See: No split ends!
I'll climb, but cut me some slack.
I asked him to take a little off the top...
You can slide down.  It's stiff.
My mousse awaits.
Rapunzel, how would you like to become the next Madame de Pompadour?
Remember to pull with you back
As long as I don't bend my neck, you'll be OK
Naturally, they both swiped right
What did you think would happen?  Jump.
The other way wasn't working, so I used Aquanet.  Just try it.
See? Escape route disguised as a man bun!
You don’t listen to me!
Don’t worry I used the super hold hair spray!
You’re in for some stiff competition
Just climb down! Don't worry! I use plenty of product!
It's extra strength Never Fail hair gel, so shimmy on down.
Small world! Reminds me so much of a fairy tale I once read.
This is how long you're supposed to grow it.
You wouldn't let down your hair, so I asked for an up-do! Prithee, come down this instant, Rapunzel.
Come back next week,Game if Thrones is on.
Donald Trump recommended you
No, don’t try to pull me up, just slide down !
Yes my dear, you could use a little conditioner.
It don't know how to break it to you. I started seeing Harry.
Okay, now before you come down let's figure out the physics of this.
Ok, I’ll get my roots done and give it another go next week!
I never cared much for this part.
Fake mousse!
Alright, maybe I overdid it with the hair gel.
Methinks this hipster thing has gone too far.
With how long it took you to get ready I thought of a different escape route.
Be careful! It’s a bad hair day.
You should shampoo.
Madame Pompadour, I presume.
Trump signed another executive order so now we all have to get combovers.
I’m the one sliding down, not dragging you up
I guess there is something to be said for traditional sex roles after all.
Split Ends?...I'll give you split ends.
Um, on second thought, what don’t you just shimmy down the tower and I’ll catch you.
Can you fix my weave?
I only wanted a hair of the dog that bit me.  Instead, I got the President's hair wall of worry.
The video was in Swedish. I don't know how the story goes..
How is it that I get cursed but YOU get the hair?
I think we need to review this scene.
Do I have any split ends?
I came over for a comb over.
What's wrong with this story?
What am I supposed to do with these split-ends?
This new hair gel is da bomb!
Sorry, they only gel they had was “gentle hold”.
I got an extra tease at Supercuts.
now you can climb down because I've let up my hair.
Why don't I borrow the catapult.
My explanation?  Well...have you seen the movie ‘Something About Mary?’
Plot twist! Sponsored by Rapunzel's Hair Gel.
Quick -- before the hair gel melts!
When you're done stroking, climb on.
I recommend a conditioner and a new stylist.
Rapunzel, how do YOU deal with split ends?
Watch out! It"s a  hair transplant."
You’ve got a serious split ends problem.
I’ll hold your hair, climb up it.
Thanks for the hair extension.
My stylist told me this would work.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel... you have me by my long hairs.
Let go, let go of my hair
Don't quit pulling, we may have something here.
Let up, will ya!!?
I appreciate the effort, but ...
I asked for an up updo.
Split ends a relationship.
This is not the way this story was written.”
Are you out of your mind?
If we try, I think we can swing it.
Someday you'll be president, but for now Im cutting you loose.
Listen, I'm all for gender equality but shouldn't I be up there?
Trust me, Honey.  This new product is amazing.
it doesn't quite work that way
No, no, we can make this work.  You work on your arm strength and I'll come back in seven more years.
Mousse call
You didn't tell me you had lice!
All the kids are doing it.
How can you not marry me just because I have split ends?
You sure you want me to let my hair down?
I was always embarrassed by my cowlick until now.
Forget the nits, just slide down already
Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
I told you the tar pit hair gel was a mistake.
I'm a natural blue wave.
They’re just hair extensions; the ‘product’ was my idea.
I'll pull.......you climb
Compatibility is overrated.
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a kiss?
Some say I've taken the "Trump Look" to an extreme, but as you can see it's quite manageable.
Yes, I used your shampoo, now pull me up.
Rapunzel,  my man-bun does have a purpose.
No!! that's a Granny Knot!
Well, you never questioned using my hair.
OK so it's a comb-over. That doesn't mean I belong to any particular political party. We can dye it red or blue. Just come down already.
Just for once could you let up on that hair thing!
Let's think this over again before you jump anywhere.
No my darling, I didn't read the whole book, I stopped at the hair growing part.
I use Rogaine.  You should try it.
From a #MeToo perspective, this is the more prudent approach.
Did you say slide down?
A bit too much mousse, mayhaps?
What do you mean I have split ends?
Okay, the hard part’s over. I’ve somehow flung my hair up to you. Now, on to the painful part.
YOU TURNED MY WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
Who's Ben Stiller?
Honestly, it's a bit of a let down...
I grew it out this time: you lift ME up.
You come highly recommended as a stylist for long hair.
I know what it looks like, but trust me, you shouldn't climb down.
I call it a ‘hairection.’ Whaddaya think?
See! It feels better with conditioner.
Trump's hairdresser said the only way out of this mess is for you to rescue me.
Should we trade places?
No, No, Rapunzel, let down MY golden hair.
Hairs your ride!
Princess, I know we live in a progressive world but physics have their own limits.
Thank heavens for hair gel.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let go my golden hair!
I am still not quite clear on what tensile strength has to do with true love.
I did as you told me. Now how will this new equality help us exactly?
'You'd think a let-up would be easier than a let-down.'
Please, Ms. Repunzel. We can talk about this. Just put down the hair.
Lola.  What's yours?
Yikes!!!.....lice.
Just imagine how hirsute our children would be.
I like it the way it is.
Nice perm, but I', still waiting for a prince.
I tried some new product and got a bit carried away.
They told me there's a job opening here. . .
Perhaps we try a man bun trampoline next?
Just snip off the split ends, please.
I thought for sure you'd grab me by the short hairs.
This feels suspiciously like Rayon
totally trans fairy tale.
I just need a trim.
How many cans of Aqua Net did you use?
Some call it “Dandruff in Distress”.
Not sure, I just followed the directions on the bottle!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, this is not what I meant by an updo!
Do you think its long enough for a combover?
Yup, definitely seeing some split ends.
Next time we'll try a French twist
Slide on down, honey. It's starched!
I've let it grow for just this day.
I’m hoping I meet the criteria to live in your castle.
On the count of three, I'll whip my hair back and forth.
Rapunzal! Rapunzal! Uh...right...I...must retreat hither for I fear I dost not think this through.
Actually I’m just having a bad hair day.
Hold on tight and jump!
Like "Something About Mary", but it took a whole football team
We can't keep seeing each other like this.
I think that this is wrong.
What the..., how the..., huh.
It's a new full-body shampoo.
I think that's enough hair gel, thanks.
'There are so many split ends, I'll never make it!"
Lice with wings. How else could my hair have gotten up there?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your.......oh, never mind.
Yes I used conditioner- just pull!
Wouldn't it be easier if you ....?
"This doesn't look safe."
"I thought it was the other way around."
Why is this not the right time to bring up your split ends?
If  I used enough hair spray you should be able to slide down to me .
What shampoo do you suggest for my split ends?
Any ideas on how to deal with theses split ends?
.riah ruoy nwod tel, Leznuper, Leznuper
Hair your me lend  Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Repel Zell!
No worries. Quick-crete hair gel.
Can you give me a blue wave?
Sometimes we just can't carry out the same roles.
Yeah, I don't think gravity quite works like that
Wonderful! Just what I was looking for! How much to turn this into a weave?
Yup, it’s Lice.
Throw the book down, I don't think this is right!  I think you may be dyslexic!
Me thinks this is more a 'let your hair down' moment, and not a 'hair standing on end' one
I untied my top knot. How do you like it?
Hate lice. Think I got the last one
My stylist cornered the hair gel market.
Not a chance . The wax will ruin my dress
You said it's rent controlled, right?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Give back my hair
There's something about this that just isn't right...
So we're eating in tonight?
What do you mean the only mousse left in the Kingdom is chocolate?
What creme rinse dost thou recommend?
So me and Prince Charming didn’t work out. Is it cool if I move back in with you and dad?
Rapunzel Rapunzel pull up my hair so that you may descend...if you dare.
Mr. Trump, why are you letting your hair grow so long on one side of your head?
You want me to climb Up !
I guess we got something wrong here, Rapunzel. You better let down my hair - I'd rather take thy stair.
It’s safe.  I used Aqua Net.
Yes there's a few gray hairs now, I worked for the Donald in the White House!
If you've got time, could you braid it?
I call it a reverse mullet.  Party in the back and business in the front.
Because you're worth it!
Perfect! Now I'll lower you down...
It's the latest thing in hair-care products: industrial strength mousse. I'd be glad to climb up and demonstrate it, or you can just slide down.
How do you treat your split ends?
Rapunzel, do not underestimate the strength of brylcreem.
I thought this was a non gender specific tale.
I’m sorry I ever criticized you for using too much hair product.
Must you reverse such a painful gender norm?
No, no, no don't tie it off."
You know, gravity doesn't work this way
I am checking you for ticks.  Consider it foreplay.
What did you call it again? Hairspray?
It's 2018!
Viagra, Viagra send up your hair.
Love your hairspray.
The elevator is broken, so how about I pull you up this time?
Look, kid, do you want into the clubhouse or not
Hair today gone tomorrow
How much biotin was in those capsules you sent me?
Am I woke enough for you now?
I'm going for that California serf look.
Just warning you:  I already spent the reward money on rogaine and mousse!
Let up your hair
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, it’s not over till the comb over.
Come on down, you know what they say about guys with long hair...
Sure it's worthless, but I figured you'd appreciate it more than most.
You're using the wrong conditioner.
I’m capable of compromise
OK, but this is the last time I let you up here like this, hair-spray is REALLY BAD for the environment!
I'm not sure how it's relevant, but if you must know, I use a 3-in-1 -- it's shampoo, conditioner and body wash.
Oh Prince, how resourceful of you to grow out your man-bun just in case.
I straightened it for you!
ok  let go bitch
I hope it'll hold.  I ran out of gel.
Pull me up, I’m having a bad hair day!
I think we need to go back to the drawing board. Good thought though!
Tie it to the bedpost and when you climb down we'll cut it off, who knoweth, we may even start a fashion trend...
That's right. More endurance styling gel.
Here’s your problem: too many split ends.
Sure, it's grueling. But just spin around, and I ensure you this will create the optimal man bun.
You totally have the best fans in the world. We call ourselves Rapunzies!"
Haven’t you ever seen Up the Down Staircase?
Quick. Slide down the hair pole before it rains
Oooh! Argan oil?
I said, do you have any conditioner
You say your name is Sampson, and yes, we do take walk ins!
It isn't that. It is super hold hair spray.
Too soon?
This is bass ackwards
With this great comb over you could become king.
Look, hon, just tie-&-slide ! The gel’ll come off in the moat.
Oh so now that we’ve flipped you suddenly start paying attention!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Seriously, let go of my updo.
Wait...I know things have changed with the #metoo movement, but this is just not going to work.
Don't worry - I used my sister's 24-hour superhold gel.
Sorry,but that won't work. It's a toupee.
I know it's backwards, but what can you expect from someone named Leznupar?
This is actually my real hair. Why do you ask?
Blondes definitely have more fun.
You realize, Rapunzel, this hurts like hell....
Tie it around your waist really tight, then jump down into my arms.
Repunzel, Repunzel pull me up!
This  doesn't need a caption. It's funny as it is.
Go ahead and come down, it will hold up fine, I used this really strong punk hair spray.
Well, I suppose that turnabout is fair play._or_Yes, you definitely used too much mousse.
Split ends?  But I condition, I rinse and repeat!
No!t there! The key's in the lock! Not locks!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel slide down my moussed up hair!
I thought you'd like my man bun.
Yes, the hair spray will come out ! ! Now go to school ! !
Sorry but everything is upside down these days!
The softness is from a blend of medieval conditioners.
How about this? Come over the balcony and try to slide down my hair.  I bet this will work."
Nothing too fancy...I’m only going forraging.
Rapunzdel, Rapunzel, let down your hair gel.
So when I saw yours, I had this idea: With some strategic overcombing, I could be king!
That conditioner you recommended is a little much!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!...just slide on down and let's get this over with. I have a 3pm conference call.
Just another bad hair day.  Can you braid it for me?
it's just a little hair gel, ok?
I just went sulfate-free. Can you tell?
...And if you get 10 other people you know people to sell the conditioner you'll get an even bigger house
It's rock hard from from hair gel, so use it slide down.
Millennials.
Got curlers I could borrow?
My dearest Rapunzel, I must confess that I'm afraid of heights so I grew and shellacked my hair for you to climb down and be freed!
Oh no! The witch reversed the spell.
Repunzel, Repunzel, up-do my hair!
I'm all for emancipation but are you sure there is no stairs
Now you tell me about the hairspray!
Do you think it will hold?
Don't read the whole thing. Just pull me up!
Wait till there's a stiff breeze.
Do you have the same problem with split ends?
I'm sure you're also perfectly capable of opening the door yourself.
I hate it when screenplay writers can't stay true to the story
No, I didn't know split ends was one of the 7 signs of damaged hair.
Testing.
Wanna come up?
Is anything wrong? Is it too oily?
Okay, just start running!
If you don’t stay away from those fire-breathing dragons, this heat damage is going to get even worse.
I used that organic coconut oil like you suggested.
Sorry to bother you, ma’am, but I think I left my keys inside.
Hey Rapunzel, check out this new gel they have in the castle bathroom!
I love your mousse!
This reverse psychology thing has got to stop.
No, baby! You got this all wrong
Equality gives us more options.
JUST THINK HOW LONG OUR CHILDREN'S HAIR WILL BE!!!!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, climb down my hair! Give thanks to l'Oreal hairspray, which keeps it up in the air.
You have a lot of split ends.
Hey, split ends or not--you said you'd come over to my castle next time.
I think that we are facing a hairy situation
Whoa! Which one of us is Repunzel?
Hey, it worked when I was up there!
It's bottom up marketing, babe.
Do you have enough hairspray?
Whaddya mean I can’t move back home?
You're still dodging the question. Just this once, could we use your rope ladder instead?
Unbelievable. Not one split end.
It took 13 cans of pomade and a staff of 3!
Just climb down. I used extra stiff gel from the Shores of Jersey.
This way ticks both the gender swap and strong female lead boxes.
Slide down!
Let me up! It is way too crazy out here.
No lice that I can see.
I'd suggest a deep-hydrating treatment twice a week.
No, we cannot juxtapose Jack in the Beanstalk into this fairy tale!
Stop doubting me - I used plenty of product.
Yeah, I do use too much gel, but some people think it's cute!
..gender/shmender, you're supposed to have the hair...
Quick, Rapunzel! The bottle said an hour, and I spent half of that on styling!
Yeah, they have these great gallon jugs of hair gel at Costco.
I don’t think that a man bun is particularly regal.
It has enough hairspray for you to slide down.
Thanks! It’s all about the routine! One day wash, next day condition!
I just don't understand.  I used conditioner.
See, no head lice. Now will you come down?
Come back when you're in better condition.
The first tower tryst of Trumpunzel.
Now, show me what you do to get yours so soft.
Not too much product, but a LOT of backcombing...
Well...climb down here, dummy.
He drew it wrong !
No, the rabbit comes OUT of the hole, around the tree and back in the hole.
I don't think it's supposed to work this way.
Just keep pulling!
What do I do about the split ends?
You need to do something about these split ends.
Stop whining; I was banished for lice and foot fungus.
Do I have split ends?
Now listen, Rapunzel, I'm not as into revisionist Grimm as you are--let's stay with the original!
I'm having a bad hair day.
My father put me here in the 70’s to keep me away from long-haired boys.
Now, this man is mine!
Once upon a time, there was a product...
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, trust my hair stylist’s gravity-defying formula
No worries!  It's stiff from pomade.  Hop on!  Slide down!
I just feel bad that by lifting me up you're doing all the work.
Trust me, you don't want to wait for the matching carpet.
No more hair-splitting, your turn to come down
Why don't we call them "Locks of Love"?
It's a little damaged but I'm conditioning."
Be careful.  I just had it colored.
Okay, let go, that's all the pomade I've got.
Never mind the split ends and rappelunzel on down.
Rapundzil, Repundzil, let down your...oh forget it!
Why do they call this a Sadie Hawkins rescue?
It's thoroughly combed and knot-free... unless that's not your kind of thing.
OK OK toss me down a scissor
I'll be up again next Saturday
It’s the natural progression of the man bun! Roll with me!!
I grew it for this special moment. Now slide down!
You might braid it first.
And you’re positive that there are no other hair salons in all of the land?
Who knew this hairstyle could be both fashionable and functional?
With enough hairspray, I’ll slide down like it’s a fire pole.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel....... Oh, wait!.. I  think I’m confused..... There is definitely something wrong here..... Am I supposed to climb up on my hair? Or you climb down on my hair? Or on your hair?..... We need a re-write
Don't you think this is a little too much 'party in the back'?
OK.  I get it!  It hurts to have your hair pulled.  Please let down my golden hair!!
This isn't what I had in mind when you said all business in the front and party in the back.
Do you have any extra-hold hairspray?
I thought you were praying for a blue wave.
I think this role reversal thing has gone too far
Worst. Weave. Ever.
I told you I had split ends
Keep it up and you'll have natural frosted tips in no time.
Did you use the strong hold hairspray?
I beseech thee, fair maiden. Entrust thy destiny to this plan.
You've got me by the short hairs."
Look, are you looking to buy or not? I've got another buyer at the Eastern Tower.
My place is better.
Yes, it’s all in the product!
Good to know I'm not the only one compensating.
Ok, let's do this. Now...pull!
I'm compulsively competitive.
Do you have mousse?
I just hope I used enough hairspray.
Just climb down. We can discuss the dandruff later.
You summoned Lyft 1.0 at your service...
No, you can't use it as a rope; I just conditioned it.
Brylcreem.
Please don't pull! I said "pomade" not "old maid".
I’m not sure this trickle-down strategy is working.
CAN I PULL YOU UP BY YOUR HAIR
I’ll have the usual
Oh, come on, Zel! Can’t you just swing me once more?
Do you think it needs conditioner  ?
I know, very soft. Would you like the shampoo?
Now I know how it feels.
It’s a combover.
I didn't want to alarm you, but it is pretty hair raising
Oh damsel, I shall even endure the agony of a bad hair day to forever win your love!
I usually do 87 on top and maybe 3 on the sides. No sideburns, please.
More gel?
Cooties? I'm rescuing you from burning at the stake and you're worried about cooties?
Rapunzel, They said I would get bagels with your locks!
But then I figured, what's the use if we're both locked in the tower?
You missed my point completely.
What kind of conditioner do you use?
No Hare Hair Here, Hear?
Hilda,I'm hair for you.
Rapunzel, Raunzel, Propecia really works!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair,  cause with matching  braids, we'll be quite a pair!
I thought you said: Throw your hair in the air like you just don't care.
Donald, your hair really is quite long.
I may have used too much hair gel
It'called Butch Wax, handed down to me by my great grandfather.
Now, that's what I call product!
Yes! I promise you I put in plenty of gel. Let's do this thing. On your mark, get set... GO!!
If I were you I'd be more worried about escaping, but yes--my name really is Rapunzadude.
Well, I fell for YOU
Oh,it's revisionist; history from the bottom up.
It's my new up do style.
By the way, you’re out of hairspray.
Sorry, but I never date guys with hair longer than mine."
Did I mention that I'm a woman trapped in a man's body?
Lather . Rinse . Repeat 
Lather .Rinse .Repeat ...
Conditioner? What's conditioner?
Rapunzel a reverse love story
Sorry, it took awhile to collect enough hair gel.
Uh, Methinks this needeth to be the other way round.
Can you lend me a comb and a gallon of conditioner?
It seems sort of familiar, but I’m struggling to work out the living happily ever after bit.
The  Brothers Grimm re-write the story of Rapunzel for 21st century readers.
I received an extension for family leave.
This first date is just not going to work out, Repunzel.
This would work better if you pull harder.
Ok, hold on tight . . .now comes the back flip and the hand over hand . . . you're not going to believe this . . . .
OK Prince Charming...so now who's the one who's life is 'going nowhere' ?!
Rapunzel. Dating you has become a hair raising experience.
You must sport quite the man bun
Hairraising elopement!
Oh totally, and that's only one of the great things about cornstarch.
Look, I’ve had enough. 
You feel let down again? Really?
How’s about you let UP for once!
So tell me again how split ends play into this whole rescue thing?
It's 2018! You're on the Pill, I'll wear a condom, and then...we won't do it. Ok?
What would you suggest for my split ends?
It’s like Freaky Friday, but we’re - whoa, Phillip! You have a serious problem with split ends!
I defy stereotype.
You got some conditioner?  I’ll give you my shoes.
'I've used something new, called gel!'
OK, I’ll wash it and come back later.
Needs more product.
We’re related!
Hair's to you, Rapunzel!
I styled it in an up-do especially for you!
Thank you, Dippity Do!
See? My hair's gone erectile!
Growing your hair would've been a better idea; physics 101.
I don't think this is going to work.
I should have listened. Coming down was a bad idea.
I either need a haircut, or a bigger hat.
Now that you can grasp the gravity of my situation, do something about it!
Pull me up, give me a haircut and we’ll live happily ever after.
Hair extensions are cheaper than a ladder.
Be down in a sec...
...and we were separated at birth
Look how progressive my love for thee!
Now we have something in common
Trust me. My hair products GUARANTEE that they're 'damsel in distress' worthy!
Not too hard. It's a weave.
Well, it does take a lot of hairspray, but we cant all have a tower for our updo.
Now this is what I would call a hairy situation!
I can't put in the barette until you let go.
This is the first comb-over I’ve ever liked.
Don't worry, Jimmy Fallon gave it a tug to make sure it's sturdy.
See, I told you. Just look at these split ends!
OMG! Karen,  how much was your weave?
¨My, my, my, Delilah......¨
What kind of conditioner are you using?
Do you have any conditioner recommendations?
I understand Rapunzel, it's your turn. Last week was last week. Go ahead. Start pulling.
Thanks for the hair straightener."
And the mutton fat made it shiny, too!

Look down!!  Look down!!  Look down!!
Ewe!  When was the last time you washed this mess?
You remember, in the bad old days it was the poor woman who had to use her hair...
I had to go back to the drug store twice for more hair gel.
I hope you used Dippity-Do Extra Hold.
You'll be fine. I use an extra hold styling mousse.
Let's try that again, this time with shoes.
Trading Places is a different movie!
Maybe skip the braids this time and just do dreads.
Red Rover,Red Rover,let up your reddish comb-over.
You need to change your shampoo!
Now tie my hair to your hair and climb down.
What are Nits? And no, I do not have a microscope with me.
You know, I'd be happy to fix those split ends if I could only get down from this tower.
The PTA finally realized it went too far when reversing all the gender norms in their library.
I just read about the theory of relativity. This should work too.

A little dab'll do me.
No, I said "town crier," not "blown drier,
I was told you were the person to go to for hair fashion advice.
This is just a fantasy, you can use my hair to climb down.
Rappel, Rappel, trust my hair gel!
I can't hear you over the volume of my hair!
It’s dandruff!
I grew it long enough for you to escape.  Should I braid it first?
It is because you  bought the wrong hair conditioner
Is the color really worth splitting hairs over?
Well, it worked for me.
Instructions Unclear.
I think this is the way Rapunzel did it???
Punzie, I get that you’d rather come down than have me come up, but I’m afraid we’re going to have to rethink your plan.
Split ends are a safety hazard
It's tough to do our thing in Australia!
I used the new gel, just slide down Rapunzel.
Told you this was a dead end.
Yes I know it’s supposed to be the other way around but casting gave me the wrong script and I’ve been working on this role for years!
Don't pull so hard this time.
I used 5 jars of hair gel m'lady, which should enable you to slide down.

I thought an alternative was in order after you said you were considering a pixie cut.
Now that's what I call a real tether in my cap!
I'm pretty sure it is only an updo
Your ad on match.com said you were seeking long hair
Because I thought it would be great for a caption.
Now throw down the conditioner.
Say it! 'Me too'
You could climb up if you really wanted to.
It might work out if you have spiked heels!
Repunzel, Repunzel, let me borrow your brush!
You didn't use conditioner

You can do it. Just climb down and we'll run away.
I am trying a new conditioner
And I thought I was having a bad hair day!
I wanted to be pulled up by my bootstraps, not my hair.
It's stable: I use hair gel.
Don't worry, I put a lot of hairspray on it.
Why don’t you come up?
The optics of me saving you, not as shareable as you hoisting me up.

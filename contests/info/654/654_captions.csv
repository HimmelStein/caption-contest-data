No, I’m sure that I said fennel.

Didn't the cook know this was a recipe for a disaster?
This dish is a disaster.
I can't wait to see the Molten Lava Cake.

Maybe leave the towel.
I think I’d better cancel that lava cake

Cancel the Baked Alaska.
Could you turn off the ceiling fan?
I'm declaring a plate of emergency.
My friends warned me about the atmosphere in this place.
Before you go, describe the iceberg salad.
Reality check, please.
That's ok. I'll give it a whirl.
The chef  is really cooking up a storm tonight.
And for dessert I'd like the lava cake.
I say tomato, you bring tornado; let's call the whole thing off.
Our chef has been cooking up a storm.
The chef suggests stirring in the opposite direction.
Don’t worry, soon it’ll be downgraded to a tropical bisque.
Let’s cancel that molten lava cake order.
I'd like to speak to the meteorologist.
From a recipe for disaster?

Also, it's too cold.
I'm saying the whole meal is a disaster.
I called you over to say there was a fly in my soup, but things have escalated since then.
Please cancel the flambé.
Can I get this downgraded to a tropical storm?
Okay, so I'm guessing my crackers are in Kansas?
I’m sorry, but this soup is a disaster.
Maybe it does happen only once in a hundred years. I'm still sending it back.
I demand to see the meteorologist.
I'd like to cancel my crepes flambe.
I said, "Thai food! Not typhoon."
Do you have any crackers shaped like mobile homes?
I think blowing on it made it worse.
Do you think you could turn down the ceiling fan?
Fennel, I said.
I'm sorry you're disappointed, but the menu did note that our soups rotate seasonally.
If you like this I’m sure you will enjoy the lava cake for dessert.
This soup is a natural disaster.
This whole evening has been a disaster!
It's not a hair or anything, but I thought it was worth letting you know about.
I distinctly said, ‘fennel’.
I just assumed that Category 5 meant spicy.
It’s fine, I’ll just eat around it.”
Perhaps sir would like a table not quite so close to the ceiling fan?
Chef has been cooking up a storm today.
What does the chef forecast for tonight's entree?
Cancel the volcano cake
Could you turn the ceiling fan down, please?
I said funnel CAKE!
It's part of our farm to table menu.
Can I order again, in English?
I said fennel soup, not funnel soup
That's the last time I say "Surprise me."
Excuse me, but I ordered the funnel CAKE.
I thought you were five stars, not category five.
Would it take an act of God for you to bring me a napkin?
Can you turn the overhead fan down a little?
On second thought, cancel the volcano roll.
About dessert, could you give me a few details regarding the chocolate volcano cake?
This reminds me of my Auntie Em’s recipe.
I assume the rainbow trout is less literal.
And for dessert I'll have the funnel cake."
I’m going to need another napkin.
On second thought, cancel my dessert order for the “Death By Chocolate” cake.
I asked for fennel.
So this is a Kansas farm-to-table dish, then?
I see your chef added a new twist.
What do you mean I'm paying for the atmosphere?
A true farm-to-table experience is fraught with peril.
I ordered clockwise.
I hope it picks up the tab.
The wine is lovely, but the soup is a disaster.
I'd like to change my wine pairing to something more robust.
I guess it's safer than your chocolate lava cake though.
You haven’t seen my daughter or her dog, by any chance?
Does your restaurant have a basement?
I’d like this to go, please.
And I'll have your funnel cake for dessert.
It’s a new twist on an old recipe
To be honest, it's not blowing me away.
This is why I prefer menus printed in English.
Its eye is bigger than my stomach.
This is a disaster.
I ordered Funnel Cake!
It’s a recipe for disaster.
I realize everything is moving to the cloud but this is ridiculous.
Waiter, there's a fly - and the wreckage of several rural communities - in my soup.
Well, the soup is a disaster!
On second thought, I will take that napkin.
This soup is literally a disaster.
Excuse me - I ordered the bread bowl, not the dust bowl.
For dessert, I'll have the mudslide.
Should I have blown clockwise?
Save room for our funnel cake!
Never mind the cracked pepper. Do you have a basement?
No, I mean it literally sucks.
Will you be experiencing our chocolate lava cake for dessert?
And to drink, may I have a Hurricane?
What's the weather forecast for the entrée ?
You're going to make me ask for the bib, aren't you?
If I survive the soup, I will have Death by Chocolate for dessert.
I would not recommend sending it back, sir.
To paraphrase Gershwin” You say tomato, I say tornado “
I'm vortex intolerant.
It began as an area of low pressure over the Pinot Noir.
The mini mobile homes are a nice touch.
Sorry to bother, but I’m wondering if it might be possible to turn down the ceiling fan a bit?
and I'll take the funnel cake for dessert!
The menu said clockwise.
I’ll wrap this for you, and your little dog too.
So basically it’s just yesterday’s soup du jour with a twist.
Waiter, there are small red shoes in my soup.
Is this seasonal?
'Still water will be fine, thank you.'
I knew it was a mistake to try to order in French.
Farm to table.
So am I right to assume FEMA will pick up my check?
My soup just granted me three wishes.
Tell the chef that the soup here is a disaster.
Tell the chef he's not in Kansas anymore!
And what kind of disaster should I expect for the entree?
It's just like my Auntie Em used to make.
I thought you said fennel.
I ordered the counterclockwise.
Will conditions change in time for my entree?
And how long will it be before my entree makes landfall?
There's been a mistake.  I ordered a blizzard.
And does climate change also explain why I don't have a spoon?
On second thought cancel that funnel cake.
It’s today’s soup special, sir. 
The Clam Before the Storm.
And for dessert I'll have the molten lava cake.
No, I said fennel soup.
Yes, I tried blowing on it. Why do you ask?
This dish is a total disaster.
The itsy bitsy spider in my soup just went up the waterspout.
Auntie Em’s recipe?
You say they don’t serve this soup in Kansas anymore?
Funnel soup? I ordered fennel soup!
Waiter, there’s an eye in my soup.
Would you mind turning the ceiling fan down?
Give my compliments to the chef, he's been cooking up a storm!
So this must be what you mean by “farm to table.”
I believe it has something to do with the plate tectonics, sir.
Excuse me, I ordered the Category 3.
This “Farm to Table” trend is getting way out of hand.
I guess the fly is the least of my problems.
Our spin on farm to table.
Excuse me, I believe I ordered the calm before the storm
This soup is a disaster
Is this the chef's recipe for disaster?
There’s been a mistake— I ordered my tempest in a teapot.
This soup is a recipe for disaster!

Honestly, I wasn't blown away by this dish.
My compliments to the meteorologist.
We're a Category 5 restaurant.
Waiter, there's an act of God in my soup."
Nevermind. It's taking itself back.
This meal is a disaster.
Do you have any category 3 crackers?
When you said the soup would blow me away, this is not what I had in mind.
Is the forecast for dessert any better?
All I did was blow on it.
Could you maybe turn off the ceiling fan?
Could I downgrade this soup to tropical storm?
I was wondering what would be unique about Kansas chowder
There’s a house in my soup.
I'm pretty sure I ordered a Category 3.
It's from our seasonal menu.
Excuse me, but I ordered the calm chowder.
Our Chef, Dorthy, is from Kansas.
I thought "A Perfect Storm of Flavors" was just menu hyperbole.
This meal has been a natural disaster.
This isn't even the weirdest thing to happen to me today.
You say tomato, I say tornado... let’s call the whole thing off.
Waiter...there are tiny farm implements in my soup.
Now everyone will notice that I'm eating alone.
Does this restaurant have a basement!?
Compliments to the Chef, I'm totally blown away.
I actually ordered the funnel cake...
I think it took my napkin.
I'd like this to go.
The soup's fine. It's just that you placed my wine glass and bottle to my left.
Could I have something with a less dramatic presentation?
If it reaches category four, I'm sending it back.
You were right. The first course does change the atmosphere in here.
Well I wasn't eating alone a second ago.
I now regret blowing on it.
There's an eye in my soup.
I think I had this in Kansas once.
We take farm to table very seriously here."
I'm afraid to order the baked Alaska.
My apologies, Sir. Your meal will be on the house... once the house lands.
I need something to chase it with.
And for dessert,sir,we have a delicious funnel cake.
Yes, it IS very impressive, but I said “tomato.”
Please tell Pierre I'm loving his new spin on the bouillabaisse.
I said fennel, not funnel!
Our new chef?  From Kansas, why do you ask sir?
When I said I wanted the soup to go, I didn’t mean this.
Dude. Fennel,not funnel.
What wine would you suggest?
After the "all clear" I"ll need you to grate some more parmesan.
I can hardly wait for the molten chocolate cake.
Would you mind turning off the ceiling fan?
It's a seasonal soup.
So, funnel cakes for dessert, I assume?
It's a solid first course, but it does not blow me away.
How many disasters should I anticipate coming out of the kitchen tonight?
There must be some mix-up. I ordered the funnel cake.
This may constitute farm-to-table cuisine in Kansas, but we’re not in Kansas anymore.
So do I have to click my heels together three times to get some bread?
For dessert the funnel cake is to die for
I thought you said, “ carrot and chive not category five...”
I thought you meant 'fennel' soup.
No. No. No.  To-ma-to.
Are these even in season?
When you said I’d be carried away by the soup, this is not what I expected.
On second thought, I'll take a table inside.
I'm quite sure I asked for Fennel Soup.
On second thought, I’ll skip the funnel cake.
There's a trailer park in my soup.
Really, this soup is a disaster.
No, I’m sure I said “tomato.”
Should I eat this or report it to the Weather Channel?
It's seasonal.
Waiter, this soup is a disaster.
I haven't tried it yet, but I'm expecting to be blown away.
I hope the restroom isn't somewhere over the rainbow".
I'm in a hurry. Can you go ahead and bring out the lava cake?
I believe I ordered the category 5.
I've changed my mind.  I'll keep the one with the fly in it.
Bring me a chaser.
Sorry, but I seem to have lost my spoon again.
When I ordered this in Australia it spun in the opposite direction.
Do I call FEMA or Zagat?
I said, 'Thai FOOD'!
What would you recommend I chase this with?
Whatever. Tomato, tomaato, tornado, tornaado.
Cancel the funnel cake.
My compliments to the chef, the presentation is phenomenal.
When I said 'with a twist', I meant in my drink.
I said tomato.
Okay, bring back the bowl with the fly.
Sir, I believe you asked the chef to “whip something up?”
Common mistake, sir. A lot of our diners misread it as 'fennel' when they order this dish.
Maybe a little less atmosphere?
Is it local?
Could you bring me another spoon?
You're sure it's local?
In Washington we put a spin on everything.
You've cooked up a storm!
And to drink, I’d like a hurricane.
Garcon, there's flying in my soup.
Is it too late to change my order to a category 2 soup?
I don't think blowing on it will help.
Could I try something less assertive?
We recommend you hold on to your spoon very tightly.
I'll need a napkin.
So, just eat around it, you say?
So it’s an authentic Midwestern recipe?
I hear that this bisque is taking the city by storm!
It’ll blow over.
It's a modern twist on a culinary classic.
The entree paired with the soup du jour is "Duck and Cover."
Fennel...I ordered the fennel soup.
Wow, they're really cooking up a storm back there, huh?
It’s getting harder and harder to deny climate change.
Nice twist on the soup!
I assumed it was a misspelling.
I blew a little too hard.
Tell the chef his soup sucks
Think I'll cancel the Baked Alaska.
It didn't blow me away.
Can I change to indoor seating?
Excuse me, I said “Fennel” not “Funnel”
I ordered a Category 1, not a 5.
I ordered tomato, you heard tornado.  Let’s call the whole thing off.
The good news is the fly is no longer in my soup.
An inconvenient soup, indeed.
Is this the chef's idea of whipping something up?
Waiter, there’s a flume in my soup
Is this Kosher?
You did ask the chef to whip something up
A recipe from the Chef’s Auntie Em, you say?
Alright, I'll give it a whirl.
I see you’re still figuring out this whole farm to table thing...
I see now why people complain about the atmosphere here
Can I actually get the bowl with the fly back?
I may have mispronounced my order
Well, I did say 'surprise me'.
Is this in season?
All I did was click my heels together.
"Waiter, there's a polar vortex in my gazpacho.
My compliments to the Chief Meteorologist.
Is everything here farm-to-table?
Waiter--there's a microclimate in my soup.
I'm not blown away.
It happens when dry cold air meets warm moist air meets Vichyssoise.
It's the soup of the day of reckoning
I ordered the fennel soup.
Well, I can't say I'm blown away.
If I find a pair of ruby slippers in there I'm sending it back.
...no, not funnel; "f-e-n-n-e-l".
It's not exactly blowing me away.
I'm afraid there's been a mistake. I ordered the tempest in a tea pot.
I think I'll have rainbow sherbet for dessert.
I'll take the second course in the cellar
Excuse me sir, I thought I ordered the funnel cake?
Do you have another table not so close to the fan?
When they said this place had atmosphere they weren’t kidding!
We've been cooking up a storm here lately.
When did the seasonal menu change?
Blowing is just making it worse!
I'll need a copy of the bill for FEMA.
Is this  Kansas-farm-to-table?
We put our own twist on it.
The food here's good, but the atmosphere sucks.
I may need extra napkins.
Do you mind raising the barometric pressure in here a little?
Can I switch this out for some calm chowder?
I thought the special was fennel soup.
I think there was a mistake. I ordered the funnel cake.
I’ve had this dish south of the equator, but it always spins clockwise.
For dessert, I recommend the funnel cake.
He’ll give 3 wishes, but they have to involve soup.
I ordered the Category 2.
I'm afraid this will give me wind.
I assure you the next course will blow you away.
I'm just guessing here, but will there be volcano cake for dessert?
Very occasionally, the cold air from the entrance and the warm humid air from the kitchen meet at this very table.
Yes, the chef's put a new spin on it.
Don't bother. Looks like that fly is gone now.
Chef will be pairing that with a chocolate volcano this evening.
If this is what the beef tournedos look like, I would like to cancel my order for the pu pu platter and bloody mary, please.
For dessert I'll have the chocolate lava cake.
I believe I ordered the funnel cake.
Was I not supposed to stir it?
Was this predicted?
The new chef has really been cooking up a storm.
Yes there's a problem!  Do you see a spoon?
If you enjoy this sir,I would highly recommend the funnel cake for dessert.
Buckle up, Sir. The main course will be out soon.
I'm going to need more croutons.
No matter how you spin it, the soup's terrible.
It's the same thing, sir. We used to serve it in a teapot.
I believe I asked for Fennel Soup...
So this is what "seasonal" means here in Kansas?
Is it best enjoyed in the basement?
So this is storm to table.
‘’ Sheer culinary wizardry! My compliments to Chef Oz.’’
This new chef is really cooking up a storm.
Can I order something else? This soup is a natural disaster.
It's Farm to Table. That farm is experiencing a weather event until 10 pm.
And all ingredients are seasonal and locally-sourced here in Kansas?
Fennel -- I said fennel soup!
My compliments to the wizard.
Well this is an interesting twist
Will dessert be another disaster?
Bring me the chocolate lava cake instead.
Do you have a table closer to the root cellar?
You say "tornado," but I said "tomato."
Yes, that took care of the fly, but there's still a problem.
I thought the menu said  “tournedos”.
Sir, can you direct me to the basement?
Thank you.  I believe the fly is gone.
I don’t care if it’s complimentary.
I asked for Funnel Cake.
Naturally, the soup is a disaster.
I said Category 2.
No matter how you spin it, it's still just soup.
That's an interesting spin on an old favorite.
What's the forecast for tomorrow's soup of the day?
I say “tomato,” you say “tornado”.
Blowing on it only makes it worse!
Please cancel the flambéed dessert.
What pairs better? A Hurricane or a Dark and Stormy?
Does this come with a chaser?
Your soup is just 2 degrees hotter but, already, the storms are more frequent and intense.
This soup has taken me by storm.
This meal is a catastrophe.
I ordered the funnel CAKE!
I specifically ordered "clockwise."
I said “fennel”  soup.
I thought you said the special was 'fennel soup.'
I said fennel soup, not funnel.
I ordered the category three, this soup is only mildly devastating.
I ordered a cup- not a bowl
Waiter, I asked for fennel soup.
I thought the menu said it was topped with a cloud of fennel.
Actually, could I sit inside?
It's impressive, but I ordered the tournedos.
No, I said Fennel !
I ordered FENNEL soup!!
Tomato. I asked for the Tomato soup.
I had no idea the Kansas bisque would be so authentic.
Yes, it was doing that before I started stirring it.
I thought I ordered the category one
Well, the fly certainly isn't in there anymore.
This is the last time I order farm to table.
Did you know that in the Southern hemisphere, it spins in the opposite direction?
And I'll have funnel cake for dessert.
Am I the first responder?
I wouldn’t be surprised if it gave me wind.
It tastes good but the plating is a bit of a disaster.
Obviously this recipe was taken from the cloud.
Doesn't this take the whole 'farm to table' thing a little too literally?
I don’t care that it’s seasonal.
I give it a Category 5 out of 5.
Excuse me, I ordered cream of TOMATO.
Will you _please_ turn off that ceiling fan?
Actually, I ordered a category 3.
Is there any way I can get this to go?
'It's a new twist on an old favorite'
It is truly a farm to table experience.
And for dessert, I'd like the funnel cake.
So this is the ‘No Place Like Home-made Soup’?
Waiter, I asked for the FENNEL soup.
...and please go ahead and put in my order for the chocolate volcano for dessert
Cancel the hot wings.
I distinctly ordered the calm chowder.
We strive for a low pressure dining experience here.
The soup's not great but you do get three wishes
I don't care if they're in season.
I  asked you to sprinkle a little 'fennel' on top
I think I'll need the bib.
But is this tornado locally grown?
Is it too late to switch to the salad?
I ordered it for here, not to go.
Lemme guess--the chef's cooking up a storm again.
Actually, I ordered the tournedos.
I ordered a category four.
You asked to surprise you, sir.
I wasn’t blown away by the soup.
I'm certain I said fennel soup.
Could you bring back the bowl with the fly?
I believe I said Fennel.
I believe I said Fennel not Funnel
Waiter! There's an anomaly in my soup!
You said the chef is from Kansas?
I asked for fennel not funnel
Actually I think I'd like this to go.
Waiter, there's a wormhole in my soup.
Waiter, there’s a microclimate in my gazpacho.
I asked for the soup to be heated, not globally warmed.
I just rubbed the plate...
Actually, I ordered the fennel soup.
Did I hear you to say this place is known for its atmosphere?
Yelp DID say your soup would blow me away.
I expected a little better from the Four Seasons.
The chef has a new spin on an old favorite
I thought you said it was a simple "twist" on a classic.
What's the weather for dessert?
Please give my compliments to the shaman.
Sorry, I ordered the funnel CAKE.
I also ordered a Yellow Brick Road.
That reminds me....are there funnel cakes on the dessert menu?
It was too hot so I just kept blowing.
Can you at least look a little surprised.
Excuse me, I asked for the fennel soup, not the funnel.
Amazing!  I'll finish with a tempest in a teapot!
I think the ceiling fan is a little too powerful.
It's a seasonal specialty, sir.
Did you say 'soupe du jour' or 'force majeure'?
Enjoy, Sir. It’s best before landfall.
Could I get an extra napkin?
Tournedos ...I ordered the tournedos.
So this is how you're doing the farm-to-table thing now?
Tomato, tornado, let's call the whole thing off.
Excuse me, but I had ordered the category 1.
Waiter, is this the Category 5 ?
My compliments to the chef!  This soup has blown me away!
Does no one in your kitchen know how to read a barometer?
On second thought, I'll have a salad.
No. I specifically ordered the tournedos.
Great, now EVERYONE will see that I'm dining alone.
Forgive me.  I had assumed that "beef tornados au jus" was a spelling error.
You ordered “with a twist”
I'm sorry. I didn't order this with a twist.
This dish looked different when I had it in the Southern hemisphere.
I asked for a 3. This seems more like a Category 5.
The fly is gone, but ...
I dont care if it's weather or climate -- I want a different table."
Could you recommend something not affected by climate change?
I’m afraid there’s been a mistake. I ordered the tournedos.
This is delicious, but I'm going to need a few more napkins.
It's why we encourage all guests in the restaurant to say grace, sir.
You say "tom-a-to", 
I say "torn-a-do"
Let's call the whole thing off
This seasonal menu is a disaster
Waiter, there' s a vortex in my soup.
You're asking me if everything is okay?
Nice spin on the shrimp bisque
I'll also have the tempest in a teacup.
Well Sir, you’re not in Kansas anymore.
I asked for fennel not funnel soup.
I'm sorry to complain, but there's an eye in my soup.
I'll have rainbow sorbet for dessert.
I ordered tomato bisque, not tornado bisque.
I asked for cream of TOMATO!
Sorry sir, but this is Kansas!
And THIS is better than blowing on it, how?
The temperature is fine but the pressure is a little low.
but I ordered a 'Category 5'.
First Michelin star chef to remind me that there's no place like home.
Excuse me waiter, but there is a little house with two little feet sticking out from under it in my soup.
No, I'm pretty sure I said tomato.
So I'm guessing we're not in Kansas anymore.
And it's cold.
It’s basically Campbell’s with a spin.
Shouldn't this be in a teapot?"
It's all locally blown
I said I was on a colonic diet, not cyclonic.
I don't think I like this restaurant's atmosphere.
The chef is cooking up a storm!"
This will be in my Yelp review.
Perhaps you misunderstood, Pierre. I asked for the tournedos.
I don't know if I can eat the eye.
We wanted to put a new twist on an old classic.
Tomato, Tornado, call it what you want but let’s turn the damn thing off.
Excellent, I love a good tongue twister.
I would have preferred to just blow on it myself.
When I ordered it to go, this is not what I meant.
Not more funnel.  I said more fennel!
It looks like my ex-wife will be joining me.
And the cyclone—is it locally sourced too?
Could you pack this to go?
I know.  The new chef is adding a twist to some of the old favorites.
Our chef calls it a new twist on an old classic
But I ordered the funnel cake.
Is there a storm cellar near the wine cellar?
This is not what I meant by "surprise me".
No, everything's fine. I just need another spoon.
Which spoon do I use for this?
Waiter, there's some climate change in my soup.
Waiter, there’s a mobile home in my soup.
This is not what I meant when I asked the chef to add his own twist!
I’d like to speak to the meteorologist please.
Can you move me to a table in the basement?
Well this explains all of the mobile homes scattered around the kitchen.
I'd like to cancel my snow cone  dessert.
Is this what they meant by a new twist on an old recipe
Thai food not phoon!
I assumed this would be served in a teapot.
I was told this wasn't in season.
The chef is from Oklahoma
Waiter, cancel my drink with a twist
I asked for a clockwise rotation.
I recommend clockwise, since it's your first time and you're wearing a tie.
This is not what I meant by "blow me away"
You can take the soup out of Kansas...
I  said I wanted Thai-food, not a typhoon.
Our special is made from bone broth, parsley, cheese, heirloom tomatoes, spices and an unstable air mass
Well, at least it got rid of the fly.
I thought you said the 'Soup of the Day' was TOMATO
I said shaken, not stirred.
Relax. Our Soup Chef is also a First Responder.
Not minestrone, sir.  Maelstromone.
Blaming global warming won't help your review
Would you mind waiting to serve the second course until Dorothy arrives?
Excuse me, is this destructive vortex sourced locally?
I think I'll need a bigger napkin.
It’s phenomenal.
Does it look like I need freshly ground pepper??
There's my soup on the fly.
It’s a new twist on an old classic.
This is only an F-1.  I ordered spicy.
And after my dinner, I would like a tempest in a teapot.
I definitely said 'tournedos.'
Waiter, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
I thought I ordered the funnel cake.
Waiter, there's a fly and a piece of a mobil home in my soup.
NOW do you believe in climate change, Senator?
It took my soup spoon...
Wow, you're right, this is Auntie Em's recipe!
I usually just blow on it.
In Australia it goes the other way.
Can I get this to go?
i think i'd prefer the tsunami rolls.
Should I expect the same for my Volcano Cake dessert
I said heavy on the Fennel.
Actually, I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
Actually I’ll take the Tsunami Salad
The soup is fine, it’s that smug moustache that’s the problem.
There must be some mistake. I ordered the Tsunami on rye."
I believe there's been a mistake. I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
You say tor-nay-do, I say tor-nah-do...
No, I wanted the funnel *cake*.
All I said was, 'OK, I'll give it a whirl'.
...’Waiter...do you have any of those cute little miniature Trailer Parks for my soup?...’
Be careful; the bowl is hot.
We’re just beginning to understand the impact of climate change on soup.
Did you say the chef was a genius or a genie?
Please wrap this up to go.
I think you misunderstood. I asked for the fennel soup.
I ASKED for a tempest in a teapot, but this is CLEARLY a maelstrom in a minestrone.
Is this a locally sourced Act of God?
And you assure me this is authentic Northern Oklahoma cuisine?
Yes, I would like to speak with the chef...or whoever is still alive back in the kitchen.
Now that I'm familiar with the Oklahoma Soup, I think I'll pass on the San Andreas Salad.
I lost my spoon.
I take it the chef is from Kansas
An extra napkin would be nice.
I didn’t know one blow on the soup would cause such a stir.
Tell the chef we’re not in Kansas anymore.
This is not what I forecasted.
I am sorry Sir...but any complaints have to go through FEMA.
Excuse me.  I asked for tournedos, not tornados.
Maelstromoni?
Is that a fake mustache?
I ordered mine in a teapot.
You say Tomato and I say Tornado.
Send my compliments to the chef for cooking up a storm
Is this a new twist on the old recipe?
Our chef trained in Kansas.
Kansas cuisine?
Waiter, a house just fell into my soup.
"I ordered the nor'easter."
Our chef is from Kansas.
I can tell the chef really put his own twist on this one.
I'm sorry about the fly sir, but the tiny farmhouse and the old woman on her bike with a dog in her basket are actually part of the dish.
That is our blew plate special.
It's a seasonal special.
Yes, this dish has taken us by storm.
The menu said  "a twist on an old favorite", but this is ridiculous!
Today's dessert special is Funnel Cake.
Sir, quickly  stir clockwise
I suppose next you'll be bringing me a funnel cake.
Popular dish in Kansas, you say?
Well, what I actually ordered was BEEF tournedos!
Can I have another spoon?
I distinctly ordered tournedos!
I think I'm going to need a bigger spoon.
Waiter, I asked for fennel.
Tournedos.  I asked for tournedos.
On second thought, I'll just have a salad.
there's a license plate from Kansas in my soup
‘With a twist,’ I said. ‘With a twist.’
I think this is for that Kansas farm girl over at the next table.
Maybe I blew a little too hard?
I've just about had it with your bullshit, Robert.
Just Blow on it
The wind is sourced locally.
I thought it would come in a teapot.
Don't tell me. I'm not in Kansas anymore, right
So you’re saying you can’t do this to go?
Actually, can I switch to the salad?
I’ll need a bib.
Is this about my last Yelp review?
My date must be sheltering in place.
What do mean you're not responsible for acts of God?
I believe I ordered a category 4.
Our new Chef Is from Kansas !
Is this what people mean when they say this place has a certain atmosphere?
Tonight's special is a twist on a classic
When.
Waiter...This is not a funnel cake”
Waiter! This soup is too cumulonimbus.
'Blewuillabaisse', you say?
OK, I'll eat it, but I would like to cancel the polar vortex I ordered for desert.
Waiter, there's a genie in my soup.
Could I have a bib, please?
You misunderstood me.  I asked for fennel.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I told you to 'whip something up' for me.
When you told me that the special would "blow me away", this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
Could I change tables? There’s a bit of a draft here.
You say tornado, I said tournedos
There's a hair.
I asked for fennel soup.
When your ad said your soup would "blow me away," I didn't think you meant literally.
I would like a doggie bag for Toto.”
Would you let my date know I'm the one in the grey suit and glasses?
Waiter, there's a witch, a scarecrow, a lion, a tinman, a dog, a little girl, and way too much color in my soup.
Do I still have to blow on it?
No, I said TOMATO soup!
I’m rethinking the Surf and Turf entree.
It's causing quite a stir.
Some ground pepper and life insurance if you please.
I blew on it too hard.
I'm quite sure I said 'tomato', not 'tornado'
Are you sure this is the fennel soup?
Waitor, there’s a cow in my soup.
This is certainly a twist on farm to table.
I assumed you meant 'fennel'...
I thought you said fennel soup.
You meant, “tournedos”?
This is a dust bowl, I ordered a cup.
Forget Zagat's, what's the FEMA rating of this place?!
Excuse me. I distinctly remember ordering the category 4.
I asked you to add fennel, not funnel.
I'm missing my spoon...and I'll also need some extra napkins.
All of our dishes are served with a twist.
May I have another napkin?
All I did was rub the side of the bowl, and poof, you appeared.
You said blow on it.
There’s a farmhouse in my soup.
You'll notice we added a bit of a twist.
...and for my main dish, I'll have the "plague of locusts" pork chops
I think I stirred a little too hard.
This whole meal was a disaster!
They don't make this soup in Kansas anymore.
Excuse me, what did you say the other soup of the day was?
I was unaware the soup was free-range.
If I wanted this, I'd move back to Kansas.
Today’s special was flown in fresh from Kansas.
Apologies, sir. I’ll cancel the funnel cake for  your dessert as well.
Is this why there was no ranch on my salad?
Sorry to be a pain.  I ordered the funnel cake.
I said TOMATO. Let's call the whole thing off.
Is the chef from Kansas by any chance?
Nice try, but this soup still isn't blowing me away.
Give it a minute to settle; should that fail, I recommend the Duck and Cover.
I still don't have a spoon.
You say tomato; I say clear evidence of climate change.
But you're sure it's gluten-free?
Waiter, this soup sucks.
Should I blow on it?
You say tomato, I say tornato
I forgot to mention that today's dessert is the molten lava cake.
'Anything else?' Well, a napkin might be nice.
I ordered extra fennel not funnel.
I'm sorry.  I ordered a bowl of fennel soup.
Well, I was, but then the tornado took my spoon
No, the problem is there's no spoon.
You said "locally sourced," but it's going counterclockwise.
I said water sprouts!
But is it free range?
I asked for tournedos, Oscar, not tornadoes.
Not even a warning?
Not to worry, it's only a Category 1!
It's just something our chef whipped up.
I prefer the tempest in a teapot.
Ooooh, you wanted the TOMATO soup?  Yeah, that actually makes a lot more sense.
The chef is really embracing the prairie-to-table movement
Fly's gone.
I asked for the Fennel soup!
Sir, This is Kansas. I warned you not to blow on the soup.
No need to blow on it.
This is a Category 3 soup.  I ordered a Category 5.
Do I use a spoon or call 911?
Now this is what I call a twist on a classic dish.
Why do I keep hearing... “there’s no place like home... there’s no place like home.”
I'm sorry, I asked for just a twist of lemon.
Really? I thought I ordered tournedos!
And will you tell my date's mother where she went?
Well, it may be gone now, but there was a fly in my soup!
Is it too late to opt for the salad?
No, I wouldn’t say I was blown away by the soup.
Excuse me waiter, but I think there may be a trailer park in my soup.
Well, there WAS a fly in my soup.
I guess this is what they call farm to table
I'm not angry about the soup.   But I hate losing those oyster crackers.
I'm pretty sure I said Tournedos.
Is this a special soup for climate deniers?
I'm going to need an additional napkin.
I said soup de joure, not force majeur.
Blowing doesn’t help.
There must be some mistake. I ordered a hurricane.
Do I get three wishes?
It’s best eaten in the basement.
Could I have a dish not affected by climate change.
Excuse me, waiter, I ordered the tempest in the teacup, not the cyclone in the soup.
I"m sorry but this soup is a natural disaster.
Please tell the chef I have never had soup that sucked more than this.
I will certainly be mentioning this in my Yelp review.
It’s hot but blowing on it just seems redundant.
It happens sometimes when the cold sour cream hits the hot chili.
I suppose I don’t need to blow on it now
And for dessert, funnel cake
I ordered Fennel soup. This is Funnel soup.
The president's climate panel assures us it's nothing to worry about.
And stop telling me it's just a fennel cloud.
Midwestern food isn't really up my alley.
Is FEMA aware of this dish?
And how is the "No Place Like Home" soup?
Actually, I ordered the category 4.
Not funnel...Fennel !
And just before serving, the chef adds his special twist.
Now maybe the Republicans  will believe it.
Never mind that, you're certain it's gluten free?
I distinctly ordered the FENNEL soup!
On second thought, I'll have a salad instead.
Dorothy should arrive any minute. She'll have the salmon.
I really don't mind stirring it myself.
Last week you served me a tempest in a teapot. Now this !
Is Dorothy cooking tonight?
I ordered the fennel, not the funnel soup!
Excuse me, waiter? I ordered the tsunami.
A soup spoon and an anemometer, please.
Could you close the window?
We decided to give today's soup a bit of a twist.
Thanks, but I could have blown on it myself.
THIS is your “Stormy Daniels” entrée ?
Yes, it is locally sourced.
Do you have any F1 sauce?
I hear the food here has been causing quite a stir.
There must be some mistake. I ordered the tournedos.
I wanted a twist of lemon.
Where I come from they spin clockwise.
I see the chef is from Kansas.
I asked for a Category 5. This is Category 2, tops.
Could I have this in a take-out box?
I had to substitute, sir. We are out of Tempest in a Teapot.
Sir, it’s our Midwestern Clam Chowder.
Yes, you told me...several times. But I thought you were saying "tomato."
I asked for the funnel cake.
I'd prefer my tempest in a teacup.
Waiter, I believe I ordered the TOURNEDOS of beef.
Minor compared to dinner with my wife.
I probably should have asked what "nuage en entonnoir" means before ordering.
May I please have this to go?
Impressive but I actually ordered the tournedo.
I think the "vortex of flavor" description was an understatement.
Once contained it’s delicious.
Where’s the basement?
Does this look like it's counterclockwise to you?
There must be some mistake. I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
I believe Toto and Dorothy will be joining me.
This soup really sucks.
What's for dessert? An avalanche?
I distinctly ordered the tsunami.
Yes sir; in Australia it stirs counter clockwise.
I’m cumulonimbus-free.
Wow. The chef whipped this up just for me?
I see now why you call it the "Auntie Em Soup".
Well, yes, the fly is gone, but ...
Actually, I said tomato.
Let me guess...climate change?
How did you get Auntie Em's recipe?!
Is this vegan?
He’s a regular wizard in the kitchen.
If the first course doesn’t blow you away, the second will shock you to death
I said "in a teapot."
I specifically ordered the counter-clockwise.
I changed my mind. I'll have the Gumbo.
For twenty-five dollars I expect a monsoon.
I think I might need a few extra napkins.
But I ordered the cloudy with a chance of meatballs...
Excuse me, waiter, but there's an eye in my soup.
The soup has turned.
Your fresh-ground-pepper guy has anger management issues.
Yes, sir, everything on our menu is farm razed.
Actually, I prefer my tempest in a teapot.
The chef thought it would pair nicely with the tournedos of beef.
I’m sorry, I hate to make a fuss, but.....
what the fuck is this?!!
Waiter! My soup’s on the fly!
Waiter, I asked for Category 2, not Category 5.
Could I trouble you for a napkin?
Waiter, there's an itsy-bitsy spider climbing up my waterspout.
Do you think FEMA will be covering dessert?
Our soup of the day comes with a twist.
I would ask you to put it in a doggy bag, but I live in a trailer park.
On second thought, I'll take the salad.
There's a mobile home in my soup.
I’m sorry, but I ordered the Tempest in a Teacup.
Did I mispronounce Tomato?
I think this soup has a bit too much going on for my taste.
‘Locally sourced?’ It’s not even tornado season.
No, I distinctly said "tomato" soup.
I asked for FENNEL soup not funnel soup.
I ordered tomato,not tornado.
Somebody in Kansas better like vishysoisse.
You expect me to believe you only warmed it by four degrees?
Frankly, this soup is a real disaster.
I'm not in Kansas anymore, am I?
This wasn't what I meant when I said I wanted it to go.
Chef prides himself on farm-to-table.
I read you put a new spin on the gazpacho.
Could I get a side of insurance?
I thought you said wild fennel not wind funnel...
Sir, I ordered tomato soup, to..ma..to.
No, I clearly said 'tomato' soup.
'Minestrone', not 'maelstrom'!
I thought you said this was a vegan soup? I just saw a cow fly by.
Global warming, sir.  I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
I told you I was under an AC vent!
I thought you said seasoned with FENNEL.
When I said your hot noodle and cold gazpacho soup sounded like a recipe for disaster, I was speaking figuratively.
You wrongly assured me this soup was vegan.  I just saw a witch on a bicycle and a cow fly by.
It's not blowing me away.
When you bring the main course I'll be hiding under the table.
This soup literally sucks
I thought it was fennel soup
If you don't like the soup, just click your heels together three times...
I think you misheard me. I ordered TOMATO bisque.
Is something wrong, sir?
Farm Disaster to Table
Clearly you don't understand the difference between a Catgeory 3 and a Category 4 bisque.
I didn't come here for fast food
I just want to double-check: It's gluten-free, right?
Sir requested a game soup, this one's Twister.
I thought you said ‘sprout’ not ‘spout.’
I love ordering from the kids menu.
Well, it's over my soup, so technically it's a waterspout.
If I click my heals 3 times where do I go?
Yes, but is it kosher?
I like it. Tomato soup, but with a twist.
Volcano cake for dessert, sir?
The menu did say "farm-to-table"
You like tornado. I like tomato. Let's call the whole meal off.
I swear I did not click my heels.
It's not blowing me away like the guy on yelp said.
Compliments to the chef, but I ordered the tournedos.
No, I requested TOMATO soup!
I ordered the el nino.
The chef likes to put his own twist on the dish.
When you said the tournedos au poivre were impressive, you weren't exaggerating.
Every time I wear a new tie...
This meal is designed to blow you away
My soup spoon seems to have vanished  and I fear my other utensils may be at risk.
Waiter, I think my soup's not in Kansas anymore.
I don't think this soup is in Kansas anymore.
I specifically ordered the category 3 soup.
The wine is excellent but the soup is a disaster.
Could you bring another spoon with a chain attached?
Could I have another napkin please ?
Waiter, I thought you said the soup of the day was fennel!
Waiter, There is something OZ about my soup.
I specifically asked for the Category 5.
There must have been some confusion....I ordered TOMATO soup.
The cumin appears to be clashing with the fennel.
Climate change really is affecting our food.
I just wanted a TWIST of lemon.
In the Southern Hemisphere, it spins in the opposite direction.
There seems to be some misunderstanding. I ordered the tournedos.
I dare you to describe this with a straight face
This is a strange twist!
May I have a bib?
Garcon, there's a piece of vinyl siding swimming in my soup!
I tried to make it a little extra exciting since you’re dining alone.
Could I get an extra napkin, please?
I'm sure I said "tomato"...
Is there a milder option?
Not what I expected when I said surprise me.
Now I'm sorry I complained about the fly.
Is this disaster all-natural?
The chef likes to serve seasonal dishes.
So “with a twist” was literal, huh?
Sorry about that sir. Tonight has just been a whirlwind
Waiter, there's debris in my soup.
Correct me if I'm wrong, is that a barn flying in my soup?
I can't even imagine what your funnel cake must be like.
This is going in my Review!
Review: The chicken was dry and overcooked, the lobster dish was disappointingly one dimensional, and the soup was an absolute natural disaster.
You heard tornado, but I said potato.
The chef's putting a new spin on soup.
gotta say - I'd have preferred a fly
Today's soup has a twist.
I’m very sorry, sir.  Perhaps a butterfly just flapped its wings in Asia.
I honestly never send food back, but...
You had a question about the funnel cake, sir?
Compliments to the chef meteorologist.
I distinctly remember ordering a Category 1.
This is not what I envisioned when you said, "Give it a whirl."
I wouldn't really call this 'comfort' food.
Waiter, this soup is a Category 5 disaster.
Let's try again. You say potato, I say potahto. You say tornado, I say tournado?
Yes I stirred it. It's still too hot.
Ohhhh, you thought I said "fennel" soup.
I'll just have a salad, and then I'm off to see the Wizard.
I told you I'm a tornado chaser, not a tornado taster!
Could I get some bread, plywood, and a hand-crank radio?
Tempest de jour.
You say tornado, I say tomato. Let’s call the whole thing off.
At least the fly is gone, sir.
You misunderstood. I said tomato soup.
I asked the chef to add a little fennel
I'd like to send back this bisque. It's turned.
That’s it?  The chef recommends sheltering in place?
What happened to my croutons?
How does that sound anything like 'tomato'?
It's clever, but it will never replace the chocolate fountain.
You brought me the wrong drink. I ordered a hurricane.
This is a mistake. I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
Perhaps you’d prefer the funnel cake.

(Please underline the word “cake”.)
I'm not a scientist, but I think there's a weather event in my soup.
It spins the opposite way in Australia.
"This is why restaurants in trailer parks never succeed."
I can only imagine the tempest in your teapot.
I need to speak with your meteorologist!
I'd say that's a little bit more than just"a twist on traditional clam chowder"
Yes, I think I will need more croutons.
It's too much drama for a soup
I ordered the thai phoon, not the tornadolini.
On second thought I'll go for the mixed greens.
I asked for this in a teapot"
I know my wife ordered a mudslide but where is she?
Can I order this to go?
-We call it the Dorothy special.
I said a "can of soup," not a "Kansas soup!"
I'll pass on the soup thank you- it gives me terrible wind.
Looks like you've made enhancements to your farm-to-table offerings.
This dish will blow you away!
Should I say when?
Can I trouble you for some more crackers? Mine blew away.
I think the miniature red shoes are a tad over the top.
This is a new twist on the bisque!
Yes, I come here regularly; there's no place like home. There's no place like home.
Now bring me salt and pepper and a tiny wicked witch.
I think I might have stirred my soup too fast.
And what’s for dessert, the Milky Way?
Do you have anything less political?
Waiter, I could fly in my soup.
Would  you like a bib,sir?
Our ingredients are locally sourced from the Gulf, sir.
'There's a little twist in the recipe.'
That’s quite a spin you put on the soup of the day.
I believe I ordered fennel soup, not funnel soup.
Frankly, I preferred the fly.
It may be a natural disaster, but is it fresh?
This won’t make my stomach turn will it?
May I be moved to your basement section ?
On second thought, I'd prefer indoor seating.
I'm afraid there's a mix up. I ordered the fennel soup.
Quick! To the wine cellar!
Kudos to the chef for sourcing what's in season."
Wait until you try the soup.  It will blow you away!
I ordered the Tsunami bowl
Our special has taken the restaurant by storm.
Isn’t this served with ruby slippers?
There's been a misunderstanding. I ordered the Tempest in a Teacup.
Sir, I warned you not to blow on the soup
I  distinctly said 'calm chowder'!
I wanted upscale dining with a twist, not a twister!
There's a metaphor in my miso.
So this is what you meant by "Category Pho"
Could I be seated at another table? I feel a draft.
I asked for *tournedos*.
Global warming certainly is getting harder to ignore.
But you ordered “something with a twist in it”.
No, no! I ordered the martini with a twist!
So this is why you call it "Kansas chicken soup"?
So is this climate, or weather?
I’ll tell you the problem.  You forgot the spoon.
This used to be a seasonal dish but now it’s on the menu year-round.
I ordered Thai food, not typhoon.
I think you may have misheard me. I ordered tomato,not tornado.
I asked for luke warm, not global warm.
Can't wait to see what the chef whips up for dessert!
I don't usually send things back, but I think I just saw a flying cow in my soup.
Well, frankly, I preferred the fly.
This is a tornado in a tureen. I ORDERED the tempest in a teapot.
It's flown in fresh daily.
Excuse me, but I ordered mine counter-clockwise.
" It's the chef 's idea to welcome tourists to Oklahoma."
Excuse me, but I believe I ordered the beef tornadoes.
Climate change is affecting everything
The chowder appears to be a bit turbulent today sir. Would you prefer a more tranquil bisque?
Sir, I believe the chef forgot the flying cow.
Too late to get it to go?
And for dessert I’ll have the Polar Vortex.
This is why we always ask our guests not to stir their soup counterclockwise and blow on it at the same time.
You’re still in Kansas. It’s just how we serve our soup.
Last week it was a tempest in a teapot.
It twirls the other way in the southern hemisphere.
Waiter, there's a Rapture in my soup.
I distinctly ordered the tempest in a teapot.
What do you mean 'Why are you sending this back?'
It's supposed to be in a teapot.
I think I stirred my soup too fast.
May I have the soup with the fly instead?
Sir, the menu did specify tomato soup with a twist.
I thought 'funnel purée' was a typo
I asked for the tempest in a teapot.
I wanted it in a teapot.
Now I see what the Zagat review meant about the bisque causing quite a stir.
I said, "kale soup," not gale soup.
I said "tournedos."
Excuse me, I ordered the funnel cake, not the funnel cloud.
Would you mind turning down the air conditioning just a bit?
Yes, but I THOUGHT it said 'Tournedos' of beef...
I actually ordered the tempest in a teapot.
This soup will blow you away.
I think I blew too hard.
Be careful. The plate’s hot
Waiter, the eye is in my soup!
I changed my mind about the Oreo blizzard.
I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Yes, I'll mention it to the chef.
Can I be moved? I feel a draft.
Waiter, this can't be kosher.
I may have blown on it too hard.
Category Phó ?
Don't you think you're overdoing the farm-to-table craze?
I've heard of farm-to-table, but this is ridiculous!
It's a twist on a classic.
Sir, that is not a tornado since it is not over land. I would suggest it is a waterspout or, more precisely, a soup-spout.
This is really a new spin on soup!
I ordered F5...this is barely F3
It's supposed to have bacon. Where's the bacon?
May I offer you a seat in our cellar?
There must be some mistake. I ordered tournedos.
I swear. I didn’t even stir it.
May I assume sir, that following the Cyclone Bisque you would like our Tournedos de Bouef?
I don't have time to wait until this passes through.
And stop calling me Dorothy!
I ordered the Tournedos of Beef.
So, you're saying we're still in Kansas?
I think I'd rather have the one that had the fly in it.
I would like to cancel my crème brulée.
Really it's all been a disaster.
I'd like to reconsider the baked Alaska.
But I ordered the Tempest in a Teapot.
Tempests are served in teapots, not soup bowls, you oaf!
I‘m pretty sure I didn‘t order it with a twist.
Are you saying this is what the reviews meant by 'phenomenal atmosphere'?
Can you take it away?  It's already sucked in my wallet.
I’m gonna need more crackers.
This usually comes in a teapot.
The soup's way too hot; the room's way too cold. What did you expect?
Yeah? Well, you say tomato and I say tornado. Tomato, tornado... let's call the whole thing off."
No...I ordered the water sprouts.
Now do you believe in climate change?
I thought the tournedo would be beefier and less windy.
I said tomato. TO-MA-TO!
Yes, sir, it's so hot that it forms its own weather system.
My apologies, I thought I heard 'tornado bisque'
Excuse me. I thought I had ordered the TOMATO soup.
Perhaps I pronounced Tournedos incorrectly, but this is not what I had in mind.
To be authentic Tasmanian Devil soup should  be spinning clockwise
I ordered the salami, not the tsunami.
The chef recommends you eat it under the table.
Not only does this soup suck. It blows!
Tell the chef that global warming is not an excuse.
The chef put a new twist on it.
I think I may need a couple dozen more napkins...
I never said I wanted it to go.
Waiter, there's an F1 in my soup!
The review said this comes with hail. And a cow.
I ordered a Category 2 soup.
Î'd rather stir it myself,  thanks.
No, I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
Waiter, there's something flying in my soup.
It looks delicious, but I ordered fennel.
Doesn't this usually come with a chaser?
May I have a bib, please?
I know I’ve had a few glasses of wine, but I believe my food is spinning.
I'm sorry, but I ordered the aurora borealis.
Well I am sure there was a fly in my soup just a moment ago!
I’m detecting hints of cold dry polar air mixed with warm moist tropical air.
Kindly inform the chef: his high pressure cooker appears to be colliding with a low pressure system off the Gulf.
I'd like a side order of hail.
Can I take this to go instead?
You're right, I wasn't able to predict that.
Waiter, I distinctly ordered the fennel soup, not the funnel soup.
I asked for fennel soup. With tournados of beef as my entree.
I believe I ordered “TOMATO” soup.
May I also recommend the tournados of beef?
It's a bit too strong for a category 2 bisque
I ordered it shaken not stirred...
What happened to the little houses that I ordered with this soup?
I thought it might cool faster if I stirred it.
Excuse me, but there's a fly in the eye of my soup.
But I ordered a funnel 'cake' !
I meant to order fennel soup
Excuse me,  I ordered the tournedos.
I ordered the tempest in the tea pot.
We had come complaints when it was served in a teacup
I said tomato. TOMATO soup.
Very sorry sir—just another unintended consequence of climate change.”
You can really taste the atmospheric instability.
Never mind, it seems the itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout.
Send my compliments to Glinda.
Yes I need a spoon and a weather report would have been nice too!
I assume this was sustainably harvested.
Wasn't there a better way to remove the fly?
You say it's Auntie Em's famous recipe?
You really meant it when you said this soup would blow me away!
I think you misheard me. I said 'tomato,' not 'tornado.'
How did you get your mustache to match your hair like that?
I think there's been a mistake. I ordered the tournedo de boeuf.
Who's your sous chef, The Wicked Witch of the West?
I specifically asked for no spouts.
Can you let the server with the ruby slippers know that I'll take the check?
Waiter, I order tournedo of beef, not tornado of soup.
Pretty unusual to see a soup spout this time of year.
Waiter, this soup is a disaster waiting to happen
Is this tornado locally sourced?
I ordered the Vesuvius
I thought I ordered a hurricane.
Chef Dorothy says that this always happens when guests wish they were home.
We’ve run out of sparklers. Happy Birthday sir.
I’d prefer it in a teapot.
Excuse me.  I ordered tournedos of beef.
On second thought, maybe I’ll have the salad.
Waiter, there's a funnel in my soup.
I’ve changed my mind. I’ll take the salad.
Waiter, there are flies in my tornado
Ah yes sir,  the menu quite was clear that it was soup du jour with a twist
Please inform the chef that the vortex is a bit overdone.
I said umami, not tsunami.
So far it's wrecked two trailers and my appetite.
This is not what I ordered...this is neither a tempest, nor is it in a teapot.
Oui monsieur, the winds are local.
I asked for fennel soup - and funnel cake.
Her name is Dorothy, and she'll be here soon.
You misunderstood me. I ordered TOMATO soup.
Will this dish give me wind?
Here's a fun fact...it spins the other way below the equator.
I believe I ordered the eye of the round, not the eye of the storm.
I distinctly requested "Category 2"!
Is this a seasonal menu item?
I think it may have turned...
I never got my side of hail.”
I’ll have the tempest in a teapot as well.
Potato, potāto, tomato tornādo?
Pardon me, but I believe I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
Nonetheless, I remain skeptical about climate change
Yes, but I ordered a tempest in a teacup.
Ask the bartender when my Hurricane is coming.
Take this back. I asked for my tempest in a teapot.
And how are you enjoying the Tsupnami, sir?
Let the chef know I only want my salad gently tossed.
What seems to be the problem sir?
Yes, that is the Wizard of Osso Bucco
This is definitely gluten free, right?
What culinary "event" does the chef predict for the main course?
I distinctly remember ordering the tempest in a teapot.
No, no, I said “tournedos”.
No.  I ordered the tournedos of beef.
For dessert, I'll have the tempest in a teapot."
Perhaps you would prefer the tournedos of beef.
Excuse me, could you ask the chef to reduce this to a Category 4?
Is it too late to get the salad?
Force majeure soup du jour?”
My croutons seem to have taken shelter in the basement.
Are you sure that your cream of vortex is trailer-free?
Good Lord man! Not TORNADO SOUP! I said TOMATO SOUP!
There really are easier ways to influence my vote on the climate change bill.
No, I ordered the 'Tournedos' Rossini.
I never expected climate change to effect me personally.
I think I'm going to need a napkin.
I thought this only came in a teapot.
I asked for extra fennel. Not extra funnel!
I told you this soup would blow you away.
Do I look like Dorothy to you?
No...... I asked for tomato.
I believe I said tournedos.
And this is the last time I ask for a local dish in Oklahoma!
The excess calories are being removed for you, sir.
Oh, I would suggest the Maelstrom Malbec.
My compliments to the chef. He's from Kansas, right?
Waiter, there's some flying in my soup.
Your soup has been given a modern spin, yet remains simple and sublime.
My bill and a FEMA application form, please!
You said it would blow me away, but it does not.
Waiter, there's a farmhouse from Kansas in my soup.
No; I said I wanted my DRINK with a "TWIST.
Another napkin, please.
Perhaps you should check the definition of 'amuse-bouche'.
On second thought, I don’t need the pepper.
Global warming, sir.
I thought today’s soup was tomato, not tornado.
When I asked to be blown away by my meal, this wasn’t what I meant.
I"m gonna need a bigger bib
You say Tornado, I say Tournedo, Let's call the whole thing off...
Excuse me, I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
Can I get the old classic without the new spin?
I just assumed someone misspelled “fennel” on the menu.
Could I get more crackers?
Clearly the chef has one twisted sense of humor.
What weather event does the steak come with?
I asked for BEEF tournadoes!
Impressive, although I heard D'Angelo's has a category 5 pasta e fagioli
I clearly ordered fennel.
I can see that, but I would still like a spoon please.
Looks like we're not in Kansas anymore.
Actually, I asked for "tomato" soup.
The giant pepper grinder bit wasn't pretentious enough?
I’m pretty sure I ordered tournedos.
The menu said the soup was an F5, this is an F3 at best.
I asked for the twister as a side.
Impressive, but how am I supposed to Instagram this?
You’re sure this pairs well with the rosé?
Someone needs to teach the new chef how to use a metaphor.
If you don't mind, I'd rather stir it myself.
Send the check to FEMA please.
I thought you said "TOMATO" bisque!
I believe I ordered the tournedos
Did you save room for funnel cake?
We weren't in Kansas in the first place.
A rather blustery vichyssoise tonight, wouldn’t you say?
You just can’t escape climate change, can you?
Actually, I ordered the funnel cake.
I specifically asked for Cream of TOMATO soup!!!
Shouldn't this come with a funnel cake?
Yes, I know the Yelp review said 'a vortex of flavor', but still!
On second thought, I think I'll hear those specials again...
Exactly which "du jour" is this?
No, no -- you're confusing weather with climate.
Yes, but I ordered the Tempest in a Teapot
I specifically ordered a tempest in a teapot
seems more tsunami than umami to me
I specifically ordered the funnel cake!
No, everything's right, I was just wanting a bigger spoon
Ah yes...a seasonal dish with a twist...
Excuse me, I asked for the tempest in a teacup
I think I blew on it a bit too hard.
The chef certainly put a new twist on chicken soup.
I was hoping for a category five.
Sir, our sous chef is a genius with the whisk.
That’s not what I meant by “to go.”
This really is a culinary tour de force.
I think there’s been a mistake. I ordered the tournedos.
I thought I ordered the fennel soup?!
I said a bowl of 'tomato' soup!
I know lentils can give you wind, but this is ridiculous
So this is chef's new twist on an old classic?
I ordered the earthquake
Excuse me, I ordered this soup F3 not F5.
I thought it was hyperbole when it listed the soup as a 'force to be reckoned with.'
Perhaps Monsieur should enunciate when he orders the tournedos of beef.
And with my entree, I’d like to order the Aurora Borealis
Do you have something with a little less weather?
Could I get a spoon and umbrella?
Would it be possible to get "To-Go" box for this?
Waiter, there's been a mistake. I ordered tempest in a teacup.
Just making sure you're ready because in two sips this whole scene's going technicolor.
Waiter, there is an extreme weather event in my soup.
I'm going to need some extra napkins.
I thought a Hurricane was a cocktail.
Yes, it is impressive but I asked for beef TOURNEDOS.
Is this a new twist on Fennel Soup?
Fresh funnel?! I heard “fennel.”
Once it's safe could I have a little pepper?
Is it spicy?
Is this a 'watch' or a 'warning' ?"  - Mary Ellen Doyle, Charleston, South Carolina
We’re famous for serving our dishes with a twist, sir.
But I ordered an F-2
This soup was actually prepared in Kansas.
Perhaps a bigger napkin?
I am certainly impressed, but would still rather have a classic tournedos
No, not "tornado" . . . I said "tomato."
We call it the Inconvenient Bisque.
Where did the new chef learn to make tournedos?
May I have a table away from the air conditioning supply vent, please?
So this is the best soup in Kansas, eh?
I'll sound it out this time: toe-ma-to soup.
And you're saying I get a t-shirt if I finish this?
Yes, it's organic
It needs salt.
Waiter, I asked for funnel cake not funnel soup.
Excuse me. There appears to be a misunderstanding. I ordered the fennel soup!
I ordered the tempest in a teapot, not in a bowl!
No no, I ordered my drink with a twist.
I ordered tournedos de boeuf, where's the boeuf?
Excuse me.  I ordered the Beef Tournedos.
Which spoon do I eat this with?
Forecasts call for a very small tip!
So, ‘the chef puts a spin on it’ was LITERAL?
I'm sure I said "tournedos".
You’re sure it pairs with this wine?
Can I get this order to go?
I explicitly ordered the tempest in a teacup!
I might have over-stirred.
I've got a feeling we're not in canned soup anymore.
There's been a mistake. I ordered the tournedos.
Potaytos, potahtos? Tomaytos, tomahtos? Tournedos, tournados? Let’s call the whole thing off.
Excuse me, I thought I ordered the tournedos
The chef got carried away.
Waiter, there’s a polar vortex in my soup!
How is it? It's gusting, that's how it is.
Apparently, sir, it's a soupnami.
Perhaps the gentleman would prefer the veal tournedos?
Could I bother you for another spoon, please?
I said tomato, not tornado!
Well, now I find the wine disappointing.
I could have stirred it myself.
What did you think "... a burst of exotic flavors with a local twist" meant?
Technically its a waterspout
I ordered the tempest in a TEAPOT, you buffoon!
Our new chef is from Oklahoma. 
Can you tell?
Is it possible I mispronounced ‘tournedos in red wine sauce?’
Now I understand what the reviews said about this place having a "low pressure atmosphere."
So there's no funnel cake?
I’ll have my tempest in a teapot later, please.
My wife was just over there across from me--have you seen her?--perhaps upstairs?
I said with a twist!
Our soup with a twist, Monsieur.
Is there a problem?
Do you serve any other soup with less drama?
You served tornado; I said to-mah-to.
Perhaps you were correct in suggesting the salad.
I said 'on the side'
I definitely said tomato!
Oh, waiter, I ordered the tempest in a TEAPOT!
And let me guess, the beverage special is a tempest in a teapot.
If this is a twist of pepper, I’ll try the funnel cake next
Excuse me, you misunderstood,  I said 'TOMATO!"
It needs more ginger, less funnel.
I think I'll skip the boeuf flambé!
Frank was not prepared when the warm air mass from his pappardelle met with a cool microburst, created by a drop of wine, causing intense instability that started in the lower atmosphere of his place setting.
Could I have an avalanche for dessert?
I think the chef put a little too much el nino in my soup.
I ordered TOMATO soup with FENNEL.
The dill is a little overpowering.
The chef said it's just climate change, sir.
Usually this happens AFTER I've eaten it.
I’ll have to bother you for yet another spoon.
Yes sir , this is a twist on our regular potato soup.
The soup is marvelous! It blew me completely away.
If it's not global warming then what is it ?
Waiter,  not to be picky, but I specifically asked for the colliding  barometric pressure centers on the side.
Um, I ordered the Tournedos of Beef, not the beef tornadoes.
This soup is warm, humid, cold, dry and moist”
So climate change is affecting our soup now?
Sir, I believe I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
FEMA had better pick up the tab.
Could we please close the window?
Yeah, well, you say Tournedos, I say Tornado!
I really thought you said tomato, not tornado.
No, I definitely said ‘Tournedos Rossini’.”
Pardon me. I ordered the tempest in the teapot.
Nice try, but this does not change my view on climate change.
You say tornado. I said tomato.
Waiter, I don’t think I’m dining in Kansas anymore.
Yes, a glass of water would be nice!
This recipe was created by a chef in Kansas?
I quite clearly said 'tournedos.'
But I ordered a tempest in a teacup.
Pardon me, but I ordered tomato soup.
Tell the Chef   I'm not that food critic from Kansas
May I please have some extra napkins
Yes, I stirred it!
This is outrageous! I mean, no crackers?
Your pre-flatulating bean soup sir. The wind comes out during dinner for your convenience, later.
I said a dash of fennel.
I wasn't expecting a literal whirlwind of flavors
You say "tornado," I said "TOMATO" soup.
I wanted a beef tournedo not a tornado.
I thought tempests only occurred in teapots.
Could I get another table? There's a bit of a draft.
I miss the days when it was just a fly.
I'd presumed you were pronouncing "fennel soup" with a French accent.
We're out of the fennel soup. Is funnel okay?
Pardon me, but I thought this came in a teacup.
We call it the Kansas City special.
I also recommend our Tsunami Salad.
I said hold the tornado.
As I said sir, the soup special will blow you away
Clark Kent forgets he can’t just blow on his soup.
I'm no climatologist, but I find it hard to swallow.
I said BEEF TOURNEDOS.
Sorry, I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
This is going to change my YELP review
This week the chef has put a new spin on the menu.
Do you have a milder Tabasco sauce?
I've heard of a tempest in a tea cup.  But this is ridiculous.
I suppose you're going to blame this too on climate change.
I ordered the tempest in a teapot. This isn't even a proper cliche!
By any chance, is the chef 's name Dorothy?
I guess you didn't misspell "tournedo" after all.
On second thought, I'd prefer the fly.
No, I distinctly ordered Cream of TOMATO.
They don't have this kind of soup back in Kansas!
I thought I ordered the tournedos.
Whatever happened to the good old days when there was only a fly in my soup?
Our weekday chef is from Kansas.
On second thought, I'll have the bisque.
Did you really have to stir it that hard?
--Desmond Lethem, 9 years old
I'm sorry sir, but it appears that we are still in Kansas.
No, I wanted the tournedos.
I asked for Tournedos Rossini, not a tornado that rose steamy!
But does it have gluten?
You did say it was a tall order.
I suppose a to-go container is a moot point now?...
As long as it doesn't move into the wine, it's fine.
I said: TOMATO soup.
Waiter, I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
And where's the twisty bread?
That is why it is called the “Souper Vortex”!
I thought you said 'tomato' based.
Forget that—where's my bread?
Is this where I make three wishes?
This isn’t what I had in mind when you said the chef put a spin on the soup du jour.”
… this way you don't have to blow on it too cool it down."
I'm guessing there is a trailer park nearby?
Instead of the Tornado Bisque, I'll have the Calamity Chowder.
What are these trailer homes doing in my soup?
Oh — “tomato” soup.
Maybe you didn't hear me correctly.  I asked for the TOMATO soup
All I said was ‘there’s no place like home’.
And where's Dorothy?
Waiter, there is a lot more than a fly in my soup
I sincerely doubt that it is just doing the backstroke.
Would you happen to have a bib?
I think the fresh ground pepper might have been a mistake.
I ordered a large bowl of tropical cyclone and this is merely a twister.
It’s a Kansas-inspired recipe.
Customer: What is a tornado doing in my soup?
Server:  It appears to be doing The Twist, sir.
Do you have any other weathers of the day?
Chef put a new twist on it
Can I get a side of tempest in teapot with this?
This is why I asked for the croutons on the side.
May I have more croutons?
My error, Monsieur, I thought you ordered Brussels Spout soup
I said nothing of the sort. I asked for tomato.
Ambiance is an A+ but my review of the food is still up in the air.
I  requested a category 4 and this is clearly only a 3!
I ordered tornedo of beef.
Perhaps a touch less jalapeño.
Can I move to a booth?  There's a bit of a draft at this table.
I'm sorry, but I ordered the "tempest in a teapot".
I appreciate the technique and all but I wanted the tournedos.
Shouldn’t this be served in a teacup?
The wine’s okay, but I think the soup has turned.
I think your immersion blender is set too high
Looks like we're not in Campbells anymore...
Could I  bother you for another spoon?
Hold the bread—tightly.
Ahhh, Now I see why I was seated on the patio
Sorry, Sir. It used to come in a tea pot.
My apologies, Sir Nigel. Our new chef is from someplace called Oklahoma."
Waiter, there's a tiny witch in my soup.
I appreciate the presentation, but I ordered tournedos.
I asked for ‘’more fennel,’ not ‘funnel.’
Can I order another one to go?
Except for the obvious punchline, it is very good.
It’s called infusion, sir.
Waiter, there’s something a little Oz about my soup.
This soup blows.
I love eating seasonally.
Excuse me, but I asked for the F5, this is clearly an F3
It’s an original way to deal with the fly, I’ll give you that.
I ordered the Tempest in the Teapot, not the Tureen Tornado.
Excuse me sir, I think that you twisted up my order.
Can I get another spoon?
Waiter, I'd like that bowl with the fly in it back, please.
On second thought, I think I'll have the salad.
I asked the chef to surprise me, but I wasn't expecting this twist.
A bit grandiose don't you think?
Waiter, there's a tiny cow in my soup.
Do I get 3 wishes!
We are proud to be a cloud-to-table restaurant.
And for my entrée, the Category 7 Tournedos of Beef.
Waiter, there's a fly battling atmospheric instability in my soup.
What did you expect with the Kansas special?
What, no crackers?
Waiter, there's a trailer in my soup.
I think there has been a mistake. I asked for tomato soup, not tornado soup.
I’ve heard of pea soup fog, but this is ridiculous.
Does it come with 3 wishes?
I actually ordered a soupçon of beef tournedos
My compliments to the chef and to Mother Nature.
Tomato not Tornado
To be honest, I’m not blown away with this meal.
I think I prefer the fly.
No, everything's fine... I just need a bib.
Could I get a to-go container?
Waiter, there's a tornado in my soup.  I distinctly ordered tomato!
Mudslide pie for dessert?
Waiter, there's a girl with ruby slippers and her little dog too in my soup.
You'd think a five-star restaurant would at least have warning sirens.
This is precisely why I wanted to dine indoors!
Considering your four Michelin stars, I was expecting a hurricane.
Isn’t it amazing that the soup is ruined but the rest of the table remains untouched?
Should've believed them when they said this place has a terrible atmosphere.
I was just blowing on it to cool it off and this happened
May I please have another napkin?
How can you be sure it's not climate change?
i’m sorry sir, did you prefer the tornado on the side?
So that was not a misspelling. I thought I was getting a tournedos.
I said T-O-M-A-T-O
"I wanted it with just a twist of lime"
I am sorry but this soup sucks.
Yes, sir, your table is in a microclimate zone.
I believe it's more than just a fly in my soup.
A little heavy with the habaneros, don’t you think?
Excuse me, there's been some mistake.  I ordered the Tournedos.
Garçon, the soup spoon goes to the right of the knife.
I ordered the F-1. This is at least an F-3.
Trust me, it's from our new power lunch menu.
This is only an F-3. I ordered an F-4.
I suppose we're still in Kansas after all?
It could use some more salt.
I didn't order this. I ordered the Tempest in a Teapot.
And you're sure it's gluten free?
I ordered tournedos de boeuf, not tornado de soup.
Should you call the Weather Channel, or should I?
Ground pepper please.
Everything's great, thanks!
Could I move tables? I feel a draft
Tornado? I said TOMATO!
I  ordered a hurricane but this is fine.
Am I even able to send this back?
Well if you prefer, it can be paired with a Hurricane or a Mudslide.
You could have gone into a little more detail when you recommended the Trailer Park Special.
Thaiphoon wasn't just a punny restaurant name?
I distinctly requested an F2!
potato, po-tah-do, tomato, tornado ...
I think that's a bit more than a FLY!
I’m afraid I need another spoon.
Excuse me waiter, there seems to be a catastrophic weather event in my soup.
I'd prefer a more robust wine.
Is this the classic French recipe, or the chef's own twist on it?
Waiter, my spoon is missing.
Sorry, the self-stirring soup still has a few bugs in it.
Great presentation but I’m going to need a bib.
I thought I ordered the tomato soup.
Yeah the chef's been experimenting lately.
The soup is served Globally Warmed.
On second thought, I’ll take the tempest in a teapot.
We are out of the funnel cake, but the chef recommends this in its place.
Deduct a star for poor atmosphere.
Thank you, but I ordered a bowl of  T-O-M-A-T-O  soup
Excuse me but I ordered an F4
Waiter, there is a black hole in my soup!
So that's what the menu meant by 'Oklahoma Clam Chowder.'
The genie will be right out to take your wish
We were out of tomato.
The food is fine, but the ambiance is a disaster.
No, I distinctly said “tomato.”
Our famous corn soup, monsieur.  Chef says it'll take you right back  to Kansas.
It's NOT what I ordered. Tell the bartender to make me a hurricane.
Tornado soup, it's considered a delicacy in Kansas.
I said I wanted the TOMATO soup.
The food better be good. Because the atmosphere stinks.
The tornado I can live with.  It's the chef's love affair with salt that is the REAL disaster here.
-When you first opened, the tornadoes were bigger!
Excuse me, but I thought I ordered the one with fennel.
This is only an F1. I ordered the F5.
I'm sorry, but I ordered the category 1 soup.
YES, sir, I really am quite convinced that there is a draft at this table.
I thought I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
I think I’ll pass on the Tsunami Pie.
I think I might have blown on the soup too hard.
Did I hear you say the chef put a spin on this special?
You say 'tore-nay-doe', I say 'tore-nah-doe'. It's still a great bisque.
I said a tempest in a teapot!
I've asked FEMA to declare this soup a disaster.
This is your spin on a tomato soup?
I guess I over-stirred.
Yes, much more annoying than a fly.
You're sure we're not in Kansas anymore?
I meant tournedos of beef .
I asked for a twist, not a twister
They say it’s hard to attribute any specific event to climate change, but you have to admit this is a game changer.
When the menu said beef tornados, I thought it was a typo.
This is too 'farm to table' for my tastes.
Aren't tempests supposed to be in teapots and not in borscht?
Yes sir.....it's our seasonal special.
Excuse me, this soup was supposed to be hot but it appears a cold front moved in.
Isn't this normally served in a teacup?
No, I asked for the tournedos.
Scusi. I said TO-MA-TO.
I'm quite certain I ordered tournedos.
I need more crackers.
Sir, would you like some FEMA with that?
Next time, I'll be fine with just a fly in my soup
Our chef wanted to put a new spin on the menu.
Tell Chef to cancel the Tournedos of Beef
I meant to order the Tournedos
It blows on itself.
Can I get a poncho?
Excuse me, waiter, I ordered Tournados.
I would give this bisque an EF4 out of five. Is the chowder less menacing?
Excuse me, but I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
I suppose this is what happens when ambient hot air meets tasteless cold soup.
It's our seasonal North Atlantic bisque, with aromatic fennel circulation and a delectable low-pressure center.
Excuse me waiter .
There’s a tornado in my soup .
How is it you thought I said 'Tornado Basil'?
Whatever the chef says, it looks like global warming to me.
Yes, I have heard of ‘Tempest in a Teacup’, but ‘’Minestrone Maelstrom’?
Quick! To the salt cellar.
No one else complained
It's spinning the wrong way.
Climate change is having many strange effects sir.
It's just the tip of the parsnip.
Did a butterfly in Brazil flap its wings?
No, I did not stir it, "a tad vigorously"!
Are you sure this is gluten free?
Waiter, I asked for TOMATO soup
I’m sorry but I ordered tournedos.
I said “Tomato not Tornado Soup”.
It always happens when the steam of the hot soup meets the cold of the air conditioning.
I distinctly said beef tournedos!
Tornado.  I thought you said the special was Tomato.
I  asked for tomato, not tornado.
It may be what I ordered, but I thought you had misspelled tournedos.
I thought I ordered funnel cake?
I said cream of TOMATO.
Waiter, there’s a fly of biblical proportions in my soup.
Well, I've had spicier...
Is this what they call Nor'easter Clam Chowder?
It's another take on funnel cake.
Does it come with a side of insurance?
Is this not usually served in a tea cup?
When I order a tornado bisque, I expect there to be tiny mobile homes. Well, where are they?
I specifically requested the tornado on the side.
Can you bring me a new spoon?
Surprised? Yes. I expected Tournedos, not a tornado.
I assumed 'Alabama Surprise'  involved a variation of
shrimp and grits.
I'd rather have the fly in my soup.
Waiter, there's a national emergency in my soup!
I specifically said "tomato."
An odd way to remove a fly, but thank you.
You got it wrong. I ordered tournedos!
You must have misheard me... TOM-A-TO
It pairs well with our hurricane cocktail.
Are you sure this dish is gluten free?
That should take care of the fly in your soup.
The Beef Tournedos Soup was a bit more dramatic than I was expecting.
I asked for the "tomato bisque" not the "tornado risk."
I meant to order the tournedos of beef.
I might need a bib for this one.
Very impressive, but I ordered the tomato soup.
The chef is still upset about my sending back his signature dish last week?
Was there a low pressure system in the kitchen?
Are you sure this is extra, extra spicy?
My compliments to the Weatherman.
Do you mind turning the fan off?
You know I think I finally get this whole climate change thing.
My apologies. I should have mentioned the soup must be stirred COUNTER-clockwise.
There's a warm front in the kitchen and a cold front out here.
After I've reaped the whirlwind I'd like more croutons, please.
I  ordered TOURNADOES of beef.....
We've been experiencing extreme Menu Change.
Critics are calling this new restaurant a natural disaster.
We used to serve hurricanes.
T.O.U.R.N.E.D.O.S.
Google it!
I'm not sure I'm ready for "cold" fusion cuisine....
Waiter, could you bring me a spoon and a side of plywood?
Is this the new chef from Kansas?
And with dessert, may I suggest our tempest in a teapot.
Our Soupe du Jour comes with a twist.
I didn’t want this to go.
The menu said Tournedos.
TorNAYdo; TorNAHdo. It's not what I ordered.
Waiter, I ordered the TOMATO soup.
Garcon, I ordered the fennel soup.
Waiter, I think there has been a mistake.  I ordered the Tournedos.
Meteorological gastronomy.
I said a 'twist' of lemon!
Could you turn down the AC?
No, I’m sure I ordered TOMATO soup.
I guess you did say it was a whirlwind of flavor
Waiter, there's a fly-over state in my soup.
There is a new twist to this recipe!
I said, TOMATO Bisque soup.
Mais oui, Monsieur...You are not in Kansas anymore.
Excuse me, I ordered the tsunami salad
In the future, I suggest you swirl in that olive oil a little less vigorously.
The chef suggests that you  think of it as a vortex of flavors
Waiter, there's a fly--well, flying things--in my soup.
Waiter, there's a trailer park in my soup!
I’d like to change the course.
Presentation, F4, the actual soup, 2 stars.
I'm not paying extra for this.
I guess I’ll be taking this to go.
In a teapot, I don't mind. But this is just a mess.
Kudos to the chef—the Vortex-Mex chili is excellent.
Send it back please. I ordered the pea soup fog.
My croutons disappeared into the vortex funnel. May I have a few more please?
No, sir, of course that is NOT a tornado in your soup!
The croutons are rotating counterclockwise:
its a cyclone.
I thought it was accented with fennel.
So this dish has origins in the Gulf coast?
Well, a moment ago there WAS a fly in my soup!
I said To ma to, and you heard tor na do.  Please take the whole thing back.
My  apologies. I thought you said  fennel. Can you tell me about  the salad again?
I heard you say, "I'll give it a whirl."
Sir, I did tell you it was soup with a twist.
It appears the kitchen dropped a piece of funnel cake in my soup
... so, you stir counter-clockwise south of the equator?
Climate Change is getting harder to ignore.
Can I hear about your other specials?
When I said I'd give the special a whirl, this is not what I had in mind.
No, I'm not complaining about the fly!
I may have misspoken; I meant "farm-to-table."
Thanks. The fly is gone now.
I asked for a TWIST of lemon.
I already knew I wasn’t in Kansas anymore.
Apologies from the chef, sir.  We’re out of the regular tournedos.
Sir, I know you ordered a Hurricane, but the chef had to make a last minute substitution. I hope that it's ok.
I asked for TOMATO bisque
When I order sharknado soup, I expect to see some shark.
I ordered tournedos, not tornados.
I ordered a tournedos, not a tornado!
Maybe I shouldn’t have complained about the salad.
Is this your first time at a Sky to Table Restaurant?
Perhaps you could bring me a spoon?
No, I ordered tournedos.
Sorry, that’s not mine. I said tournedoes, medium rare.
I specifically asked for an F3, not an F4.
Is it still possible to choose the dinner salad?
I neglected to tell you, you weren’t supposed to stir it.
Waiter, my vortex is cold.
I want to talk to FEMA.
The Chef is really taking Restaurant Week by storm.
Tomato—I said tomato!
It started as a tempest in a teapot.
I wanted it without spouts.
Actually, I ordered tournedos of beef.
Just some bread and a poncho.
This is not my idea of  'an exciting new addition to the menu.'
I’m afraid today’s potage clearly states funnel not fennel, monsieur. Bon appetit!”
I’ve been blowing on it!
Well that puts a new twist on tomato bisque.
I imagine you're going to tell me this was caused by climate change.
When I saw the menu I hoped you had just misspelled the word 'Tomato'.
Forget the wine.  I feel like a Dark and Stormy.
Did you say "tournedo" or "tornado"?
Could I have it shaken, not stirred?
I expected this in a teacup. May I speak to your manager?
May I have some salt and a Doppler radar?
If possible, I prefer something less au courant”
Glad to see the Wizard's back in the Kitchen.
Waiter, there was a fly in my soup.
I ordered a Tempest in a Teapot, not a Cyclone in a Soup Bowl.
This soup is out of season.
I am quite certain that I ordered Tournedos of Beef.
Send this back to the kitchen. It sucks.
When I ordered tournedos, I just assumed it would be beef.
The chef tried a new secret recipe.  We'd ask him but we can't find him.
but i wanted a tempest in a teacup
It started in the teapot.
Soup of the day. Whirled Peas.
Well, monsieur, your pronunciation of "tournedos"  left much to the imagination.
Please pass on to the chef that the mobile home croutons are phenomenal.”
You say everyone who ordered it has been resuscitated?
Did you by chance bring me the Midwest instead of the Minestrone?"
No, everything isn't O.K.  I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
It’s farm to table sir.
And you’re sure the soup is organic?
Did you say funnel cloud or funnel cake?
May I suggest that if you don't speak French you take 'tournedos' off   the menu?
Take it back- I ordered the Tempest in a Teapot.
My crackers are a total loss!
Any suggestions as to a utensil I should use.
Do you have a short term forecast for my soup?
Impressive, but I ordered the to·ma·to soup.
I’ll take those ruby slippers whenever they’re ready.
I’ve had all I want for now. Could you pack the rest to go please?
Yes, it is unusual. We don't see very many tornados touch down in Manhattan.
I specifically asked that it be served in a teapot.
I thought "Tornado Soup " was a typo .
While I'm waiting for this to cool, when can I expect Chateaubriand to touch down?
I thought I was getting Thai Food, not a typhoon.
Tell Anatole to walk it back on the habaneros, eh?
I thought I told you quite clearly that I like my tempest in a teacup.
Could you wrap this in an act of God bag?
Hey!  I ordered BEEF tournedos.
My apologies, sir. We only give refunds in the event of black hole.
Calling this 'chicken soup with a twist' is a bit misleading. . .
Am I going to be blown away??!!
tuh-MAH-toh, not tor-NAH-doh
I said "Cream of Tomato", not "Tornado"!
Does global warming also affect the tomato bisque?
I thought you said "with a soupcon of fennel," not funnel.
That's quite the twist of pepper.
Could i have some garlic bread to calm it down
No, you're mistaken.  I ordered the tempest in a teacup.
I could use a spoon.
Pardon, monsieur, but I ordered the  TOURNEDOS. s'il vous plait.
Excuse me, I ordered fennel soup?
Wrap this to go and I’ll take the check, please
Waiter I ordered a Category 2...
I thought I ordered Cream of TOMATO Soup.
I'm going to pass on the Kansas special.
The prediction is high winds and heavy rains, becoming a Category 2, unless you eat it right away.
You better hope we end up outside Kansas.
Sir, the chef was last seen storming about the kitchen.
TORNADO soup?!  I thought you said Tomato soup.
Don’t try to blame this on global warming!
I may not have been clear about my dietary restrictions.
It may be farm to table, but is it organic?
Believe me, there was a fly in my soup.
The dish? It sucks.
I hope this substitute for funnel cake satisfies the gentleman.
I thought the menu said Beef “Tournedos” soup!
But I asked for tomato, not tornado soup.
If the soup's a disaster, why should I have confidence in the entree?
Tomato soup! Not tornado!
I thought you said pumpkin soup with a twist.
Waiter, there's a twister in my soup.
It’s our tomato soup with a new twist.
I still don't believe in climate change.
I'm pretty sure the menu said beef tournedos
Waiter, I ordered beef tournedos.
Our farm to table credentials are impeccable.
I said  T O M A T O  soup."
Since when does seasonal include hurricane season?
Is it too late to change it to the cheesy earthquake flatbread?
Never mind, the twister took care of it.
I think you misheard my request of 'twist of lemon'
I said the New England--not the Kansas--clam chowder.
Waiter, I ordered 'tomato' soup..
If I wanted it to go I would’ve asked.
Do you have a trailer park for an entree?
There's a damn hair in my soup.
I think it's a rift in the soup-time continuum.
I'm sorry, I thought I ordered the beef tournedos.
I'm sorry.  I ordered the tempest in teapot.
This molecular gastronomy thing is getting out of hand.
I hate to complain, but you forgot the soup spoon.
But I asked for this in a teapot.
Could I order something a bit more understated?
So, the name Dust Bowl is literal, then?
Could I have this wrapped up to go?
Oh, you wanted tournedos.
I ordered "tomato" soup, sir.
What do I get with my steak, a cattle stampede?
Waiter, there's a fumarole in my soup.
No, I ordered the tournedos!
I ordered the soup with fish tournedos.
You call it tor-nay-do. I call it tor-nah-do.
This sure beats Benihana.
Are you certain this is gluten free?
I thought you were kidding when you said that the chef’s soup would transport me to another place.
I ordered the French Onion, not the Dorothy.
I ordered bean sprout not water spout soup!
Sorry sir, I can't return the soup due to Force Majeure
I'll have them turn down the air conditioner
No, I ordered steak Tournedo
No, I definitely did not order the Minestorme soup
I said tomato bisque. T-O-M-A-T-O
I asked for cream of tomato soup, not screaming tornado soup!
You didn’t have to blow that hard; it wasn’t that hot.
My understanding was that the tempest was in the teapot.
For the last time, I ordered the funnel CAKE!
Our latest soup, Sir, with a new twist !
Waiter, there's a Dorothy in my soup.
We think it has something to do with climate change!
Not to worry, the fly has gone
Waiter, there is, amongst other things, a fly in my soup.
This gave us our third Michelin star.
On a scale of  EF-1 to EF-4, how would you rate the soup?
Your seasonal menu just blows me away!
But I distinctly ordered the Tempest in a Teapot!
Excuse me sir.  I ordered tornados of beef.
A warning would've been nice.
I did warn you, sir- our Tournedos Rossini are exceptional.
Crackers are ill-advised.
I didn’t blow on it.
Excuse me sir, but I ordered the tournedo.
I take it you're aware of the too-hot-coffee lawsuit against McDonalds?
It’s our cream of tornado soup!
I thought the tornado bisque came with croutons
You can pull this together and you STILL can't get me a spoon?!
When I asked for a “twist” I meant lemon!
Can I still change my order?
Excuse me, I asked for the “tomato” soup.
I ordered the Tournedos, not the Tornado !
I was thinking that a jar of moonshine would make for a much better pairing.
Not tornado...I said tomato.
There’s a hyperbole in my soup!
I ask for tournedous of beef....
There's been a mistake.  I ordered Thai Pho.
Our chef is trying a new twister on an old classic
The soup is angry, monsieur.
Check, please. I'm on a whirlwind tour of the city.
What do you mean your menu has a force majeure clause?
I presume this dish will not need stirring?
I did not order the meal to go.
Typo on the menu? I ordered vichyssoise with fennel.
We also have tempest-in-a-teapot.
I said ‘tomato,’ not ‘tornado.’
I thought the menu said tournadoes of beef.
There won't be anything else.
Cancel my order of beef tournedos.
Can you turn down the AC a little bit?
Our chef came to us from the Land of Oz.
So this is what you meant by minestrone with a twist...
The chef blames it on climate change.
What seems to be the problem?
It looks nice, but I ordered tournedos.
I said, Tomato.
You said, Tornado.
Oklahoma Soup, sir.
OK, you win. Climate Change IS real.
Sure, the fly is gone...
Nevertheless, there’s a fly in my soup.
Sir, I believe I ordered the "tomato" soup not the " tornado" soup.
Yes sir, they are ‘in season’.”
Did the chef survive
It's gazpacho with a twist, sir. Would you want some pepper with that?
No, my soup is on the fly.
Chef believes that great food makes its own weather.
I said a twist of pepper.
Climate change sir. Our chef desires to stay
“ ou courrent”
I guess a butterfly flapped it’s wings in China.
And our featured drink today is a tempest in a teacup.
Are you sure this is the Beef Tournedos?
This is a twist of lemon?
I said beef tournedos,not tornado.
I think pepper may be a bad idea.
For dessert, I'll go with the bombe flambe.
Is this a starter or a finisher?
Well, it's not the tournedos I asked for.
I specifically asked for the F2 chili, not the F5!
A life jacket and some bread would be nice.
Sir, you ordered from the rotating soup menu.
I'd like to meet the chef who cooked up a storm"
Actually I ordered TOURNEDOS!
And how exactly does one eat Tasmanian devil stew?
At least it’s Instagrammable
Please give my compliments to the atmospheric conditions which produced this soup.
Is Dorothy coming too?
Do you have an updated forecast?
I have no spoon.
Is this another example of your twisted humor?
I see there’s been some menu changes since our local weatherman bought the restaurant.
No, no, no!  I asked for a Tournedo Oscar, not a tornado, Oscar.
Waiter, there's been a mistake.....I ordered "TY FUN' not "TYPHOON".
No no, I ordered the SPROUT soup.
Can you turn down the fan?
Did you make a wish?
I hate to be a bother, but I actually ordered the Tournedos of Beef.
I’ll take it to go.
So where's the beef tournedos I ordered?
Oh tomato, I thought you said tornado.
Did you put your recipe in the cloud?
Sorry sir. Probably Climate related!
This isn’t what I had in mind when I ordered tournedos!
Well this is outrageous, the menu stated quite clearly it would come in a teacup
That's how you know it's hot.  It makes its own weather.
I would have preferred a fly.....
I bet this never happens at the corner table.
When will this be ready to eat?
For future, how DO you pronounce tournedos?
You have three wishes or I could take back the genie soup special
Does this mean we’re not in Kansas anymore?
I thought I ordered tournedos of beef...
I'm afraid so Sir, genetically modified foods can be unpredictable.
So, this is the soup for those feeling a bit under the weather?
I've heard of funnel cake but soup??
I will not be bullied into Lent.
That's right, a fly. And a rambunctious one at that.
Don't "tempest in a soup bowl" me. I want to see the chef.
We're not in Kansas any more.
I apologize for the misunderstanding, Sir.  I'll return right away with your Funnel Cake.
I can’t wait to see the main course.
I was expecting this in a teapot
I asked for the minestrone soup, not the maelstrom.
I hate to complain, but this appears to be a bit over-stirred.
Should we be crawling under the table?
Actually I ordered the tournedos of beef
I asked for the space time continuum on the side.
When you said “whirlwind of flavor” I was thinking cayenne pepper.
Very impressive—but I'm afraid I ordered the tournedos.
I thought you said the soup was tomato.
And I'll have the tournedos of beef as an entree.
Waiter,I ordered the Beef Tournedos!
Could you turn down the exhaust fan a bit?
I told him tournedos.
I think this culinary chemistry craze is getting a little out of hand.
Can you get me a larger spoon?
Wait until my editor gets wind of this.
I didn't know it was in season.
I read it as 'tournedo'.
I wanted a tournedo
I think you misunderstood. I ordered white bean and fennel soup.
I ordered TOMATO soup, TOMATO!
The wine is exceptional, but it
 doesn't  go with the soup.
New twist on an old standby?
This'll be one for the climate change deniers.
You might have taken “Experience Dining” too far
I thought the menu said TOMATO soup
I heard creamy tornado.
I clearly said 'Tournedos"
Sorry, but I ordered the tournedos de boeuf.
I'd say that's rather a tad more than a "twist" of pepper.
Tomato soup, tornado soup, let's call the whole thing off.
Excuse me waiter--I ordered the tournedos of beef !!!
But I ordered beef tournedos!
May I see Dorothy after the soup has settled?
Sure they sound the same, but why would you think I said creamy tornado soup?
I didn't know a tempest was available in a soup bowl.
I ordered the Italian White Bean Soup with a Fennel Cloud, not a funnel cloud.
Well, to be frank, we're pretty sure it's a result of climate change.
I didn't realize this dish was in season.
I thought these only came in teacups?
In December ?
Excuse me, but I ordered  TOMATO soup.
The soup isn't exactly blowing me away.
I just blew on it to cool it off.
I ordered cream of tomato soup,....not cream of tornado soup!
Tornados. Not Tournedos.
Excuse me, I ordered TOMATO soup.
Please take  this back, I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
This dish is a real tongue twister.
Excuse me, Sir, but I seem to have lost Toto."
More crackers, please.
I think the chef may have gotten carried away.
Is your chef, by chance, a former weatherman?
I asked for the Parting of the Red Sea.
I thought the tempest only came in a teapot.
Sorry, sir, that tempest should be in table 7's teapot.
I don't mean to be rude but I did ask for the tornado on the side.
It’s the latest in meteorological gastronomy.
Did I mispronounce tournedos?
Are these kinds of soup events the new normal?
I said "Tournedos" not Tornadoes
I asked for the beef tournados.
Interesting, but I ordered  Tournedos!
Maybe turn the air conditioner down a little?
Tournedo, tournedo! T-o-u-r-n-e-d-o.
But the menu said "a twist of lemon".
It's normally served in a teapot.
So, where does Chef source the watersprouts?
Waiter, I think my birds nest soup is flying south for the winter .
May I suggest a bib?
Fennel was mis-spelled on this week’s ingredient order.
We were all out of Tempest in a Teapot.
It needs more salt.
I ordered tournedos of beef.  Where's the beef?
So, I am not in Kansas anymore?
I ordered a funnel cake with a strawberry citrus drizzle---not a weather situation."
It tasted so bad, I just uttered, "Oh My GOD, take it away"!
Just wondering if this soup is covered by FEMA.
I always order broth when I'm feeling under the weather.
We can't be sure, Sir, but we suspect global warming.
May I have a storm chaser with my wine?
Can I have the climate denier entree instead?
This was supposed to come in a teapot.
Waiter, a suggestion for the Chief, stop stirring the soup clockwise.
Is the chef missing a funnel?
I like my soup less globally warmed.
Funnel cake, not funnel cloud
Waiter, there's a Coriolis Effect in my soup
So even your soups are flown in fresh every day?
If you like the tomato tornado you should really try the funnel cake.
Is the tornado vegan?
Chef Toto calls this his Kansas special.
You should not have blown on it so hard.
Waiter, there is a ' No Fly Zone" in my soup!
It's our new "Climate Change Clam Chowder."
No, I'm sure blowing on it won't help.
Let me guess Toto, we're not in Sarti's anymore?
Take it back, I’m a gastronomical change denier.”
Yes sir, you ordered the tomato tornado.
Sorry... but I actually ordered the tsunami bisque.
I think that was too much fresh ground pepper after all.
Sure, but where's the spoon?
Hm, it’s a little too salty
The atmosphere in this place is a bit much, don't you think?
Tell the chef I prefer my soup hot, not turbulent.
I thought you said the Soup of the Day was Tomato,not Tornado...
And I'll have the tsunami pasta for my main course.
Keeping up with climate change, we changed Tempest in a Teacup to Tornado in a Tureen
Yes, the debris field is to my liking.
Please take this back. I ordered the Tournedos Rossini.
Maybe I shouldn't order an entrée.
Yes, I completely agree, this is an exciting twist from farm-to-table.
I'd prefer to have this served in a teapot.
No, the wine is fine.
Something is odd here, Eddy. Oh yes, you forgot my spoon.
I said "Spoon"; not "Typhoon".
I would have preferred the fly in my soup.
Waiter, the tornado is cold.
What does Gazpacho mean again?
The genie is out. You may make your wish now, Sir.
Yes, it's quite the presentation, but I ordered the "tournedos."
Looks like God is giving you a poor Yelp rating.
I'm sorry, was this tornado locally sourced?
I thought for sure that I ordered tomato soup, not tornado soup!
I ordered the glacier melt.
Waiter, what is this tornado doing in my soup?
Is this the F-4 or F-5 soup?
What did I order?
I thought it came with the genie
I said tomato soup, not tornado soup.
This global warming is causing some pretty extreme microclimates.
Actually, the hail is extra.
I asked for the beef tournedos not a soup tornado.
Is there a problem with your soup?
Sir, the butternut squash came from Kansas.
Mr. kent, did you blow on your soup again?
Now, do you believe in global warming?
Yelp users said this soup was an F5, but I’d say it’s barely an F3...
Is it too late to order the locust appetizer?
Our chef de cuisine uses the best organically produced ingredients to represent our current climate and political change.
Well I thought this would blow me away.
Tell me, am I still in Kansas?
Climate change, Sir
I'm literally blown away by this soup!
It calls for a tyspoon.
Taste's fine, but could use a bit more in the presentation.
I said the funnel cake not soup
Excuse me, but this is not the tournedos that I ordered.
Heaven to table? Seriously!
It’s Vortexas Chili, Sir.
But I ordered a Tsunami.
Well, at least you gave me a still wine.
On second thought, I'll try the F1 curry.
I ordered tomato. You served tornado. I like tomato. This is tor-mado. Tomato. Tornado. Ta-mah-to. Potato. Let’s call the whole thing off.
I ordered the salad.
Sir, you did order Chef's Global Warming Surprise Soup.
Get under the table.
Tomato, you idiot! Not tornedo!
Tornado bisque?
I said "rare TOURNEDOS"
I clearly said the 'tomato' bisque.
I'll take the FEMA check.
NOT TO MENTION THIS IS NOT A TEACUP
Waiter, there’s a storm in my soup.
When I order my soup F3, I like it to be served F3.
I must have misspoke I want  TOMATO SOUP
Yes, this soup is most definitely in season.
Is this the F4 or 5?
I think this the tornado soup...I ordered the tomato soup
Sir, the chef suggests you wait 10 minutes.
I asked for the funnel cake, not the funnel cloud.
No I did not.  I ordered the tournedos.
This is too 'in season'.
I asked for TOMATO soup!
I said, "good warm soup" not "global warming soup".
Um...I believe I ordered tomato, not tornado, soup.
A light swirl of creme fraiche,” was an understatement
No dessert but I would like to try the tempest in a teapot.
No, I said I wanted a funnel CAKE with my soup!
‘Let me guess. This will be extra . . .’
I distinctly ordered a tempest in a teacup
I suppose it is soup with a twist.
I'm missing a spoon.
Perhaps I will have the salad instead.
I asked for warm soup, not globally warm soup.
I said, "The science is inconclusive."
Please tell the chef this doesn't have enough millibars.
I think there’s been some mistake—I ordered the tempest in the teapot.
No, I clearly said would like to begin with the tempest in a teapot.
Excuse me waiter, there is a genie in my soup!
We didn’t have a teapot.
I'm going to need another spoon.
Climate change is really starting to hit close to home.
You might want to stir a little slower.
Well, you see, as global soup temperatures rise...
Pardon me, I ordered the New England chowder. Not the Oklahoma chowder.
I ordered the Soup with a Twist but this is ridiculous.
No, I said the beef tournedos
I’m certain I said FENNEL soup. I’ve never even heard of funnel soup.
And a Hurricane to drink, please.
The atmosphere in here is extremely depressing.
The new twist on tomato soup is excellent.
I don't know, sir.  I'm a virtual server, not a cloud server.
Could you bring extra crackers please.
It appears I didn't enunciate the word "to-ma-to"  clearly enough.
I said I wanted something with a twist - not twister.
The chef guarantees the bisque will blow you away...
Would it kill you to bring me a spoon?
... rising hot air above the soup mixing with the falling, cold air from the A/C, oh, never mind. Just get under the table until it passes.
I ordered the typhoon.
I asked for a twist of lime, not a twister
No, no, no, you fool, I said 'Tournados' !
Those people are staring at me because I’m eating alone.
My soup's cold.
You did say tournedo, sir.
It picked up my spoon.
You forgot the side of hail.
Waiter, I ordered my soup with a twist. Not a twister!
Take this back. I ordered tournedos.
It’s the wrath of the day.
Does this look like a vol-au-vent to you ?
Tournedos?
Yes, I’m afraid that can happen when hot air meets a cold soup.
Once again, Sir, I am certain I ordered the "Tempest in a Teapot"
My apologies, I asked for cream of fennel soup.
I thought it came in a teapot.
Waiter, I only ordered an F-2.
You say ‘tornado’ , I said ‘tomato’... let’s call the whole off..
You said I would be blown away with my dish.
I said I wanted my martini with a twist.
Gluten-free, you say?
Now, that’s what I call fusion.
I’m sorry...I thought you said TOMATO basil.
While I appreciate the artisanry, I'm afraid I can't stomach any more than an F2.
I didn’t order this ‘to go.'
Your Climate Change Consumme is a bit more than I expected."
I’m gonna need another spoon.
Extra napkins, please.
Where's the tempest in a teapot that I ordered?
Its regular tomato soup with a twist.
It is the chef's surprise
I guess we're not eating in Kansas anymore.
Our soup is globally warmed.
Not tornado soup... I ordered tomato soup!
Re-thinking the Green New Deal, Senator?
'Dorothy back?'
Little bit of a tongue twister, eh?
...a word with the Chef.
I thought the tempest came with teapot....
The polar vortex makes everyone’s soup cold, sir.
You meant it literally? Tornado soup?
The soup here really sucks.
I don't see Unlimited Breadsticks, do you?
No. No. No. I said steak Tournedos.
I had a different vision of tournedos of beef...
Could I get one without the special effect?
Its a perfect storm of Tobasco sauce, jalapenos, and Grey Poupon.
Sorry for the mix up....Your Tournedos de boeuf will be right out.
I assumed it was a misprint for 'tomato.'
Chef must have added the tongue of toad before the eye newt.
Today's soup with a twist
There seems to be some mistake. I ordered the TOMATO soup.
The is the chef's twist on a classic recipe.
Does it have a name yet?
May I have another spoon? I seem to have lost mine.
Tou say tournedo and I say tornado.
Is there a table farther away from the air return?
I asked for the mushroom cloud soup.
I'm assuming it's there's-no-place-like-home style?
Waiter, there's a sky in my soup!
There's a localized manifestation of climate change in my soup.
Waiter, I distinctly ordered the tournedos de boeuf.
This is impressive but I ordered tournedos.
I need this reheated.
I’m sorry, but I’m tornado-intolerant.
I ordered the beef TOURNADOES.
Waiter, I better eat this in the cellar.
What do you mean I must have ‘over-stirred’ it?
Ok, fine, but I hope my entree doesn't have any flying monkeys.
This makes my stomach turn.
Human caused or not, I'm not paying for it.
I can stir my own soup
Tomato, tornado; it's just a difference in inflection, convection, and some Louisiana hot sauce, Sir.
If this is "Dorothy's Soup" I can't    wait to bite into the "Tin Man's Sandwich".
"I asked for fennel and sprouts."
I believe I ordered 'tomato".
Tournedo, not tornedo!
I'd rate this soup an "F-3"
This is not what I had in mind when you advertised 'soup with a twist'.
I thought Tournedos of Beef was something much different.
I ordered soup d'jour, not force majeur.
Still don't believe in global warming?
Waiter!  Get FEMA to clear my place.
Well, this is certainly an unexpected twist on Tournedos au Poivre!
No spoon?
I need another napkin.
In the teapot, dammit, not in the soup!!!
Are there any tree nuts in this twister?
We're not in Kansas anymore are we?
Can I get a refund, or at least an umbrella?
For my first wish . . .
Be warned, the soup comes with a twist.
I’m so sorry, I don’t normally do this, but I actually asked for no cilantro.
On second thought, I'll have the beef tournedos.
It’s losing all its nutrients.
You were out of tomato?
I thought "soup au vente" meant something less literal...
The new chef, sir.  He's a little pretentious.
It ate my spoon!
No sir, I distinctly remember ordering the tempest in at teapot.
I’m sure the Cream of Tornado soup is very good, but I ordered the Cream of Tomato soup.
Sir, we garnish with funnel, not fennel "
Shouldn't you issue a warning to the other tables?
Could I have the F 3 instead?
But I ordered the cream of fennel.
I must say, the serving sizes here are of biblical proportions.
Can I get a spoon, please?
So your blender's not working?
It's already on my Instagram.  I'll just take it to go, please.
Excuse me waiter, there is a tornado in my soup
I specifically said tournedos! This is a disaster!
Could I get a bigger spoon?
Please turn off the overhead fan.
At some point the refills have to stop, right?
Is this the mild version?
I prefer my soup shaken rather than stirred
The Nerello Mascalese from Mt. Etna pairs very well.
Uh, I ordered *tomato* soup, not TORNADO soup!
I specifically said shaken, not stirred.
Could I trouble you for some of those little trailer-shaped crackers to go with my FEMA bisque?
SPECIALS? How about a weather report?
Waiter, my soup is flying.
No, I ordered tournedos of beef.
Can you recommend a more tropical drink to go with this?
I ordered the hurricane.  This is tornado.
Waiter, my soup is getting cold.
"Sometimes, for no reason, I just say 'Ab-ra-ca-da-bra'!"
I told you not to blow on it.
I asked for the tempest in a teapot, not in a bowl.
I may not be entirely clear on what a veloute is.
I believe this should be served in a teapot.
Fennel cloud soup." Very funny
Kansas Chili, you say?
I hate to be a bother, but I asked for the tornado on the side.
I ordered fennel soup, not funnel soup.
There is still a fly in my soup!
Can I have a little less carrot and a little more broth?
Your soup curse is served, sir.
Thank you, but I believe I ordered the tempest in a teapot.
Just what do you mean “‘We’re not in Kansas anymore ‘?
But Monsieur!  You ordered zee Tournedos!
I asked for potato soup, not tornado soup. Just be sure to bring me salame, not a tsunami.
This isn't exactly what I meant when I said, 'Surprise me!'
I ordered the Tempest in a Teapot, NOT  the Tornado in a Tureen!
Hard to deny, isn’t it?
How do I eat this?
Served with a twister.
It beats ordering the tossed salad.
Next time I suggest you go easy on the hot sauce.
I believe I ordered a hurricane, on the rocks.
Hold the spoon with two hands, you say?
Excuse me, sir, may I please have another napkin?
The soup is great, but I ordered the tournedos of beef.
I asked for the soup spoon, not the typhoon.
You can skip the ground pepper
I could seat you further from the door.
Apparently it’s not just my world that’s spinning out of control.
Croutons would have sufficed
I've decided to forego the house salad.
I asked for the hurricane.
If this doesn’t make Trump address climate change, I don’t know what will.
You misunderstood. I ordered TOMATO, not tornado soup.
OH...Tomato...I thought you ordered tornado soup...
I didn't get any bread.
I thought I ordered the Tornedos de Boeuf
The presentation is amazing, but my soup spoon was swept up in the vortex.
Well, at least there's no more fly in my soup!
Just wait a bit for it to cool down
I ordered the Tomato Bisque. I'm quite sure I said tomato.
There`s not enough chicken, and too much wild rice.
Waiter, I'd asked for shaken, not stirred!
Soupnami, really?!
When it said Tornade Soup,'  I thought it was a typo.
I said Brussell Sprouts NOT Water Spouts!
It is called "Reap the Whirlwind", very popular since the last Presidential Election
I ordered my tempest in a cup, not a bowl
no - I ordered  the beef  TORNEDOS!
This is not the tournedos I ordered.
I’d also like the bacon, lettuce and tornado sandwich, please.
Next, I'd like some Mentos and a bottle of Diet Coke.
So when is it going to stop?
Yes, a spoon. At least one.
Monsieur, do not despair. Just stay away from the vortex.
Excuse me, I ordered the Tournedos Rossini.
I had ordered the TOMATO soup.
I guess the review of your place I wrote has caused quite a stir.
Oh, this is the chef's new twist on a classic soup.
It’ll rip the spoon right out of your mouth!
Only 5 star restaurant in Oklahoma" they said..
Yes, yes,  you can tell Chef Gore his soup is making a statement tonight.
Please call FEMA and ask for a
Soupervisor
'This is your idea of soup to go.'
Would you care for a twist of freshly ground pepper?
And I'M quite certain I said tomato bisque.
And frankly, I don't buy your 'global warming' explanation.
I asked for large carrot soup not a large carrot in my soup!
This is worse than the tempest in the teapot.
Our chef, how do you Americans say, kicked it up.
I said I wanted a tossed SALAD!
There's a plague of locusts in my soup.
I ordered the "Tempest in a Teapot".
Waiter, how do you expect me to eat this soup? I have no spoon.
Tournedos of Beef soup, sir
Yes, it does have a little kick to it, Sir!
What the fuck is this?
We leverage global climate change so you don't have to blow on your soup.
I thought the menu said the soup came with water spRouts.
It's our spin on potato leek soup.
I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't think the main issue here is that "technically speaking, it's a waterspout."
Oh...I thought the menu said ‘Tomato Soup’
It’s our Chef’s version of a tempest in a teapot.
But is it gluten-free?
I know, I know: global warming
I never thought that climate change would hit quite this close to home....
Could you turn down the ceiling fan? I'm feeling a strong draft here.
I hope you saved room for the chocolate hurricane.
And for this course we have our deconstructed funnel cake.
There goes my funnel cake.
You say tomato, I  say tornado."

Jeannie Green
Ashland, O
Please return this tempest to your soup pot
Waiter! There's a vortex in my vichyssoise!
I'm sorry, I thought you said tomato.
This is impressive, but I only ordered "Tournedos".
I can’t tell whether it’s too hot, or too cold ...
There a fly in my soup and it appears to be hosting an event of some sort.
I fear this soup might give me wind...
But I didn't order the Kansas clam chowder.
Sorry Sir, bean spout soup is not a misprint in our menu.
What are all these flies doing in my tornado?
If I decided to move to a southwestern area of this table, where would that be?
Climate change?
You were serious when you say you could whip something up quickly. But is it done?
I thought I'd left Kansas.
This still doesn't prove climate change is real.
Just a hint of spice?
This sucks.
I’m certain I said the tournedo.
On second thought, I’ll have the tomato soup.
You call this an Auntie Em!?
It's little more than a storm in a tea-cup, sir.
I ordered partly cloudy.
Is this a local wind?
You'll be reading about this in my Yelp review.
Sorry, I thought you said 'tomato' soup.
No, there's no fly in my soup, my soup is flying.
So this is what all the buzz is about.
Non monsieur, I asked for mon SPOON!
We're gonna need a bigger spoon!
The storm chaser special also includes a small tempest in your teapot.
Excuse me...my spoon and knife are wrongly set.
El Nino? That's all you can say ?!?
Chef needs to dial back on the Habanero"
Spoon, please.
They have to start some place.
Our chef’s latest creation: a tsunami of umami.
I wanted TOMATO soup, not tornado soup.
As an homage to climate change, we added just a bit of turbulance.
If you prefer, sir, we can instead bring out our mudslide cake.
If there is no place like home, why am I here?
Bean soup can give you wind
Excuse me, I ordered tomato not tornado.
You don’t notice global warming until it’s right in front of your entree.
I said that I wanted my soup with a twist, not a twister.
On second thought, hold the Drang.
Yes, that's how we serve tournedos
Atmospheric gastronomy,  sir.  Enjoy.
I will take one to go.
There seems to have been a mistake. I ordered the funnel CAKES.
You might want to begin with some Beano.
On the plus side President Trump will come and sign my Bible.
You say tornAdo,
I say tornAHdo...
When the menu discribed it as “it’s a hurricane of flavor”...
You say, there are no substitutions on the prix fix?
Ah... yes... Never mind about the fly.
Do you have any Sriracha?
You definitely ordered the Soup of the Day, sir.
This stuff works much faster than laxatives.”
Do you think this will affect my acid reflux?
Unlimited salad too?
I would like to reconsider my order of Tournedos of Beef
This soup is cold . . . with a warm updraft!
just say when
I clearly said that I wanted a tournedos in my soup.
Alright, I'm going to turn my head back now, and there better not be anything weird happening with my soup
So this comes with a side of FEMA
It’s an unusual twist on consommé.
It’s obvious what I’ll say in my review.
I clearly said T-O-M-A-T-O bisque
Well, it's just that I did ask for it on the side.
Sir, your vortex du jour.
That's our signature Cream of Tornado soup sir.
Everything is organic, sir.
Can you please turn down the fan?
Impressive, but I ordered TOMATO soup!
I ordered tomato soup, not tornado soup...
I don’t care what dimension it leads to, I want a new bowl of soup.
Honestly, I've had worse, but I could do with a spoon and a bib
I said a twist of pepper, not...
There was a fly in my soup, but he's gone now!
If I wanted a tempest I would have ordered the tea
The chef is a wizard with soup!
Waiter, I'm missing a soup spoon.
This is all very impressive, but I ordered Tournedos.
There's a polar vortex in my soup
I'll take the heavy croutons please.
Look, we're going around and around here.
May I please have a couple of extra napkins?
I think there's a problem with my soup. Are you sure it's gluten free?
Sacre bleu! I ordered tournedos!
I believe there’s been a misunderstanding. I said “tomato” soup.
Caused by cuisine change?
Rossini, this isn't exactly what I had in mind when I ordered the Beef  Tournados Gusto
Yes, our new chef has caused quite a stir.
Your soup of the day is causing quite a stir.
I ordered tournedos soup. This looks like tornado soup.
Is it gluten-free yet?
Sir, I'm afraid you're not in Kansas anymore.
I ordered tomato not tornado soup
Vacuum cooking, sir.  It adds a special twist!
I'm sorry,sir,I thought you said al VENTE.
I ordered the Lima soup, not the FEMA soup.
Can you just send my bill to FEMA?
You told me it was hot, so I blew on it.
I ordered the *tomato* bisque.
Yeah, but I don't want to be blown away.
No, I distinctly asked for the TOMATO soup.
But I asked for it on the side...
It’s our Oz soup special
I ordered Brussels sprouts, not water spouts!
Yes, it real does have a twist.
I said tomato soup. TO-MA-TO.
I said braised fennel, not breezed funnel
If I eat this, will it take me to Oz?
Now I know why it's called the Dorothy Special.
The soup is great but the creme fraiche swirl is over the top.
Where's the matzo ball?
We call this dish the "Kansas special".
Suffice it to say, the fly that flew in is gone.
I asked for three courses, not three wishes.
The chef calls it meteorological gastronomy.
You weren’t kidding, Oz the new chef is a real wizard.
It's a cyclone; tornadoes come with the entree.
What is this,one of those God damn climate change restaurants?
Careful, the plate is hot.
Does this look like a "brussel sprout" to you?
I believe I ordered tournedos.
So can I have a spoon?
Are you sure this is your tournedos Rossini?
I don’t care how it got here, I didn’t order soup!
But it was you that said to blow on it to cool it down.
Stop denying it, there's a climate change in my soup.
Oh, you ordered Tournedos?
Did you order the tournedo of beef? My mistake, sir.
Take this back.  I asked for tournedos.
Excuse me, but I believe I ordered the "tournedos" of beef stew.
I'd like to cancel the tournedos.
Waiter, what's this mobile, destructive vortex of violently rotating winds doing in my soup?
Surely you've heard of 'tempest in a teapot'.  This is 'tornado in a tureen'.
The Chef is experimenting with meteorological gastronomy.
I'm not sure we can blame this on global warming.
May I have another spoon please?
When I saw the ketchup bottle, I suspected this was a fast food joint.
I thought it would come in a nice teapot.
Chef’s Special: Eye of the Stew
I ordered the beef tournedo not the soup tornado
I think you may have misheard me when I asked for the tomato soup.
What's this?  I ordered the tournedos.
Excuse me, but I ordered tournedos in a red wine and mushroom sauce
Yes, but I ordered the Tournedos!
Well, that fly is gone!
Waiter! What's this Extreme Weather Event as a Result of Catastrophic Global Warming doing in my soup?
I see now that "Tornado" Bisque wasn't a typo on the menu.
But certainly you cannot blame every severe weather event on global climate change
And with dessert, we have a tempest in a teapot.
No...I explicitly stated: hold the cyclone
As I've told you before, north of the Equator, the risotto is stirred clockwise.
Excuse me, I ordered the funnel cake.
Is it too late to cancel the Tournedos of Beef?
I think I will pass on the fresh pepper.
Are you sure this is what she's having?
I ordered a tempest in a tea pot, not this.
My goodness, a soupspout.
You're correct, Mr. Coriolis, this one is counterclockwise as well!
Waiter, there's a carrot in my soup!"
''Waiter, I prefer my storm in a teacup.''
Please may I have a spoon, an oilskin and a life preserver?
Perhaps it sounded like "tornado soup," but I ordered tournedos boeuf.
This is the first F-4 gazpacho I've had here.
No, I asked for tournedos au poivre.
I ordered Tempest in a Teapot!
That’s some twist.
I can see why the chef named it Trailer Park soup.
Waiter, I asked for Tournedos Rossini!
I asked for tomato soup, not tornado soup.
And this will help with my cleanse?
A little too much pepper?
Like I said, I merely blew on my soup...
Its the chef's bigger vision of tempest in a teapot, she calls it tornado in a tureen .
Waiter, there's a tropical cyclone in my soup.
The chef says it’s due to climate change.
Send it back–I asked for an earthquake
My compliments to chef Aeolus.”
So this is the Oklahoma recipe?
I thought the special was tournados.
This is the soup du jour, our "northwesterly". It starts out powerful, food critics have said a category 5 as it moves in, but it will weaken as it hits the coast of the bowl, stalls-out, and dumps heavy flavors.
You asked for funnel soup, sir.
Oh, that's why it's called trailerpark soup!
Take this back.  I ordered an F5 not an 
F3.
I thought these things only happened in Tea Pots!
No, I ordered the soup and the tournados.
Sir, I ordered the *tomato* bisque!
I don't care how to pronounce it — I want "tomato"!
Waiter, please check the translation of Tournedo de boeuf.
Tournedo," well done
But the menu said "Fair to partly cloudy."
I may need another spoon.
I know what climate change is, but that doesn't explain how this is a seasonal special.
No ... what I ordered was tournedos.
Is this gluten free?
I'm sorry, we're all out of funnel cake.
It's still not hot enough.
The menu said 'tomato' basil.
I said 'hold the climate change'.
As long as it doesn't leave the plate, you're good.
I distinctly said  tempest in a teapot
Don’t blame this on climate change.
Is this what's meant by the Kansas special?
I ordered the tournedo, not a tornado
Does this go counter-clockwise in South America?
I said extra 'tomato.'
I believe I asked for tomato
Excuse me... I believe that I asked for tournedos!
And after this I'd like to try the tempest in a teapot.
I've heard of a tempest in a teapot; but a cyclone in the soup?
This soup is so cold it's reacting with the warm gulf air.
All things equal, the fly looks pretty good by comparison.
There is a mix up here, I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
Not what I meant when I asked for something low pressure.
It was too hot...
I believe I also ordered one of your world famous hurricane cocktails"
No, I ordered the beef Tournedos!
Are you sure it's non GMO?
Now what?
Does the Maelstrom Minestrone come with a bib?
That got rid of the fly.
Apologies, sir. That was supposed to come in a teacup, not a soup bowl.
It's a micro bisque burst.
So this is what they meant by a modern twist.
Where are the frogs?
Chef Robert calls Climate Change Bisque.
I always heard it was a tempest in a teapot...
No, leave it, please. I don't think she's finished.
I said Alfredo, not tornado.
Please tell the chef he put the squall in squalid.
No sir. Cyclones normally are not boxed to take home.
Technically, it's called a waterspout.
No matter what they say, Global Warming is a hoax. Now bring me a spoon, good man.
Chicken soup with a twist, eh?
Garcon! This is intolerable...my soup is being ruined by that elephant at the next table!
Would you care for a TWIST of fresh-ground pepper, sir? I'm kidding! We have fun here.
Be VERY careful of the soup, sir. It is so hot it has created its own weather system.
I  asked for the whole freshwater trout, not the bowl of waterspout.
I meant to order a serving of tournedos
What exactly goes into "soupe au changement climatique"?
Okay, now it's a warning.
I believe I ordered the Tournedos rare?
Can I get my funnel cake to go?
I thought you said tomato!
Waiter!  There's a Tasmanian Devil in my soup!
I ordered Tempest in a Teapot but you brought me Tornado in a Tureen.
Did the chef explain how one gets a spoon inside his vichysoisse vortex?
I think you misheard my order.  I wanted the tournedos.
I had a feeling we were not in Kansas anymore
Fine, I'll taste the soup. Where's the spoon?
Well, I guess I thought cream of ‘tornado’ was a colloquialism.
I specifically asked for theTOURNEDOS of beef soup.
There must be some mistake. I ordered the Tournedos Rossini.
Am I supposed to blow on this or is someone doing it for me?
Can I have an umbrella? The soup is a little inclement
No. I asked for the Beef tournedos with Madeira sauce.
Waiter there are no more flies in my soup!
It’s tornados of beef soup, sir.
I'll skip the drang.
I distinctly said I wanted the tornado on the side.
Is it safe to add some salt?
How about some bread?
Waiter, there's a green witch in my soup.
I believe I ordered the tomato soup and not the tornado soup.
Are there refunds for an Act of God?
More croutons please.
Our beef tournedos are very popular here in the midwest.
I wanted funnel cake for dessert, not funnel soup
Your food sucks
So this is your famous Mid-Western Surprise.
Third one this month.
I’m thinking, we’re not in Kansas anymore.
When you said farm to table, I thought you meant the food.
Waiter, there ‘s a spout in my soup!
Oh qui, monsieur, Les Chefs soup de jour Sriracha is well known for its category 5 heat.
Excuse me, this is a category F-4 when I specifically asked for a category F-5!
I’ve been told this soup will make me feel like I’m not in Kansas anymore.
Please bring me salt and pepper.  
Oh, and a basement when you get a chance.  
Thanks very much.
Any word on when the immersion blender will be fixed?
I really don't care if it is fresher this way.
Your menu claims it's an artisanal cyclone but any idiot can see it's just an off-the-shelf tornado.
Are all your soups whisked using renewable energy?
I’ll give you just 1 Michelin star, but you’ve definitely earned a category 5 storm rating.
Well, there _was_ a fly in my soup two minutes ago.
No Sir, the croutons are definitely in there.
Waiter, there's a hoax in my soup.
Don't worry! It will settle down when we cross the equator.
All I did was spell Dorothy with the alphabet soup!
Couldn't you just put the bowl on a lazy Susan?
No, I did not order the Tournedos.
I asked for a table away from the draft.
I hope this doesn't mean there is a witch under my plate.
How am I supposed to eat this when you've got the spoon inside the knife on the place setting?
Bisque with a twist?
No, I asked for 'Thai food.'
No on the ground pepper. Yes on the soup bib.
It's vortex vegetable.
There's a tornado in my soup.
This French onion soup is an absolute disaster”
Rebecca J. Woodul, Cincinnati, Ohio
Waiter, there's a climate change in my soup!
Sorry you think it sucks.
I asked for Chardonnay, this is Cabernet.
Excuse me. I ordered the lava cake.
No, I ordered the Hurricane.
Not SOUP.  I ordered BEEF tournedos.
Do you have a bib?
Well, you can just tell Chef Dumbledore to quit stirring the damn risotto.
Are the overhead fans really necessary?
I distinctly asked for only gale force.
Pardon me, there appears to be a flying cow in my soup.
I asked for extra fennel, not funnel!
Actually,I ordered the tempest in a teacup.
Is this really the best way to get a fly out of my soup?
How did you know I’m a meteorologist?
I ordered the chocolate lava cake.
You wanted tomato soup?  I thought you said, “tornado soup.”
I said funnel CAKE, not CLOUD.
I asked for tomato soup, not for tornado soup.
It's a hydroponic carrot, sir.
I wonder what the spicy version is like
My apologies sir. I thought I was clear. The soup of the day is tornado soup not tomato soup.
No, no, no, I said TOURNEDOS of beef!!!
Did I mispronounce Beef Tornado?
Tomato, tornado.
There's soup in my fly.
Caught fresh in the Gulf of Mexico?
Will you be having that to go
It's the chef's new signature dish - clam chowder with exotic spices and a nod to climate change.
It's the special today - our Wizard of Oz soup.
Could you bring some extra napkins, please?
The soup is a little hot.
It keeps the flies away.
I ordered tournedos of beef in mushroom wine sauce, but....
It’s a just a tad over-seasoned ...
Does this come with disaster relief paper towels?
It's a different spin on potato-leak.
Excuse me, waiter, but I believe there’s an EF-5 in my soup.
This is tomato?
I believe I asked for the Beef Tournedos.
I thought you said the soup of the day was tomato soup, but this is tornado soup!
This really is a true, in season, mid-western farm to table soup!
Sir...Im sorry but this is weak.
I believe I ordered the F5.
I distinctly said, tortilla soup.
There's a flyover state in my soup."
Can I bring you a bib sir?
It's chef's attempt to raise awareness of climate change.
Yea- we were all just getting a little tired of the tempest in a teapot thing.
Sorry, our soups been acting up lately.
Well this is a mistake,I ordered the lightning in a bottle.
Technically speaking, it's a waterspout.
Don’t worry, I blame the President.
Tell the Chef he needs to turn the power level on the blender down a tad.
I asked for tomato, not tornado, soup.
We’re out of teapots.
We try to keep our food ingredients and weather sources as local as possible
Waiter, there's a soup in my flies!
refills better be free
Can I wrap this up?
Sorry, but this usually comes in a teapot....
In a teapot, not a soup bowl!
Is this Manhattan or New England?
This one, technically speaking, is a waterspout.
Now I see why it’s called the “Dorothy and Toto special ”...
I thought I ordered tournedos!
Funnel, not fennel?
I think you misunderstood me: I ordered tomato soup, not tornado soup.
Please take back the tournados of beef broth and tell the chef to cancel my order of white lightning risotto.
We transplanted it from a teapot.
Excuse me,I said "Tempest in a teacup
I’ve heard of a tempest in a teapot, but not a tornado in a soup bowl!
This is Chef's "new twist" on vichyssoise?
And with my dessert, bring me a tempest in a teapot.”
We believe it may have something to do with bouillabaisse warming.
Tomato soup? I'm sorry, I misheard you.
No, everything is not satisfactory.  I ordered the TEMPEST, and I specifically requested that it be served in a TEAPOT!
It's the soup du jour, sir, Ragin' Cajun.
I'm going to need another spoon and some more crackers please.
This is way overcooked - I only asked for EF-3!
It’s a real tongue twister!
I clearly remember asking for the Tycoon Special!
It’s Ozpacho soup, sir. That’s how it’s meant to be served.
I ordered the beef tournedos, not tornadoes.
I just asked for a simple twist.
No, everything did not 'come out okay.'
There'd better be a jinni and three wishes at the end of this thing.
No, it's fine... I'm waiting for my chaser.
Tell the chef too much cayenne.
It's an interesting presentation, but I ordered the tomato soup.
Trouble in the kitchen today?
I was thinking more of tournedos.
Another spoon, please. And let me send a bottle of wine to the gentleman with the head wound.
Oh. I thought you asked for the beef tornado.
I asked for a side of lightning.
There must be a mistake.  I ordered the tournedos of beef
Waiter, I ordered the Tournedo, not a Tornado!
Ok, so we got rid of the fly in my soup...
Tonight we have a seasonal tornado puree.
Pardon me, but I ordered the steak Tournedos.
It's a little too salty.
No, no, no! Tomato soup, not tornado soup!
How did you know I grew up in Kansas?
It cools down faster this way, sir. Please don't blow this out of proprtion.
I guess my comment about the taste created quite a stir!
If you give me a spoon, I can stir it myself!
My apologies, sir, I believe I misspelled tomato soup when I put in your order.
I understand that the chef knows I am from Kansas, but this is going a bit too far!
Isn’t there a more humane way to get rid of the fly?
Your exhaust fan needs a tweak.
At least it's not a fly.
I ordered torenado, not tornedo.
We have a very unusual micro-climate in this seating area.
Do you have any pepper? And also, would you have the phone number for FEMA?
Sir- I ordered a tempest in a teapot.
Better than a lightning bolt, I suppose.
So that’s the Kansas soup!
It seems that Mr Dyson made little modification to our soup tureen.
I asked for tomato bisque. Not tornado bisque!
I hate to be picky, but there's something in my soup.
Not to worry, sir. FEMA is always there for our white, upper-class tornado victims.
Waiter, climate change is in my soup.
I said TOURNEDO Rossini!
Well, it often happens when the chef attempts a cross-cultural dish.
The essence of Neo-molecular cuisine, sir, is that you can't always predict the results.
Waiter, could you bring me another soup spoon?
Quite frankly, Sir, the Entree sucks even more.
It’s a speciality of the non-mountainous regions.
I hope your men's room is in the basement.
When you said it was a whirlwind of many courses, you were not kidding.
Your over the rainbow soup has a twist to it
Excuse me waiter but this soup seems to have a weird twist to it.
I said more tomato, not more tornado!
It appears that climate change has found its way to your soup.
Excuse me, sir. I found a fly in my wine.
I specifically asked for this to be shaken, not stirred.
Thank you for not ordering the large.
Your teapot tempest will be up shortly.
Unacceptable.  The soup vortex should spin clockwise in this hemisphere.
The soup tonight will blow you away
This soup does not change my views on climate change!
Sorry, sir, I thought you said tornadoes of beef.
Please hurry with those extra napkins.
Waiter, waiter, there is flying debris in my soup!
At least it is not a tempest in a teapot.
How am I supposed to instagram this?
Maybe I should have skipped the flautas con LSD
I usually have this in my teacup
I wanted the tournados AFTER the soup, not IN it.
I SAID TOMATO SOUP, NOT TORNADO
You guys clearly have a different take on gazpacho...
Sir, any fly in your soup has been vaporized
Well then, would you like to cancel your  Tournedo of Beef?
Is it too late to order the one with the fly in it?
Its happening again.
I think there's been a slight misunderstanding...
I distinctly remember ordering "Tomato" soup!
Just bring me a dish that wasn’t sourced from Kansas.
I ordered my tornado on the side.
I believe this was supposed to contain croutons?
But sir, it's carrot soup
I must have misread the soup-of-the-day as tomato.
That's impressive, but, as with my martini, I prefer that my soup be shaken, not stirred!
I’ll proceed with the main dish, once I’ll be able to grab back my denture.
Is this caused by climate change?
I’m going to need another packet of those yummy crackers.
You Americans and your air conditioning.
Oh thaaat Yelp review.”
It’s the chefs twist on consommé
Could I have a side of kale, not hail?
Waiter, latent heat of condensation has induced a low-pressure region generating vorticity over my soup.
No, I asked for the Tornedos of Beef !
In a teapot, ok, but in a soup bowl?
Sorry sir- it seems our chef got carried away.
When are you going to say when?
I can really taste de Brie.
I ordered tournedos . Maybe you didn't understand.
Waiter, my soup is a cold front.
Okay, I'll admit climate change is real.
Well, it looks like a bit of a tongue twister.
Waiter, there's fly in my soup.
Could you tell me the specials again?
Can I send back the global warming special?
Yes, I'm quite certain I said "tomato soup."
I thought I ordered the tournedos soup.
I specifically asked for hail-free. One tiny bite of hail and I blow up like a balloon.
So this is kind of a primordial soup?
Is today’s soup de jour a Texas recipe?
My soup is too windy.
I'll give you that--there's no more fly in my soup.
Waiter? There's a micro weather event in my soup.
I'm just going to let it cool down for a minute.
I hate to cause any problems, but is there any way I can move tables? I'm feeling a draft.
Could you tell me more about the provenance of the pestilence?
Would you like to send it back?
Please take this back. I believe it has turned
I said 'a spot of water', not 'a water spout'!
You were only supposed to blow on it
Yes, I’ve heard of a tempest in a teapot.
I'd be afraid to go to the bathroom.
Dust devil. Soup Satan. Whatever. I’d rather have a slice of the Angel Food cake.
Sir, I believe my soup is still brewing.
Before climate change, we only had to worry about flies in our soup.
No need to stir, but spoon from edges.
The chef calls it the habanero vortex. Enjoy!
``At the very least, you could have told me what `FEMA Clam Chowder' meant.''

I’m sorry but the teapot was misplaced.
I distinctly remember ordering the Tournedos Rossini.
So this is the gusto gumbo...

Will these Kansan beans give me wind?

Pardon me, I ordered the “Tempest in a Teapot” not the “Tornado in a Tureen”

This is medium-spicy?
J'ai dit tournedos, vous bouffon!
What's next?  The Wicked Witch of the West?
No!. I said I wanted tournedos.
I'd like a side of storm chasers.
I really don’t think climate change is responsible for this!
Where did chef learn his whisking technique?
Have you tried blowing on it?
Thank you,but I can stir my soup myself.
Oh! Tournados
It's true, global warming is everywhere.
All I asked for was a bit of extra spice
But I ordered Tournedos Rossini, not this!
Some people say tornado we prefer cyclone bisque.
This is what you call a 'twist on French onion soup'?
I believe I ordered the Earthquake Salad.
I’ve heard of a tempest in a teapot but this is ridiculous!

The weather forecast missed this.
When you said hot... you could have told me it creates it's own climate!!
It's the gazpacho vortex.
Compliments from our new chef who hails from Nebraska.
Is just a fly in my soup too much to ask for??

The chef is having a bad day.
I’ll call FEMA
I’m going to need some more pepper.
I'll have a chaser to follow.
I ordered my soup cold, not global warmed.

Two words. Borscht majeure.
It's the chef's new specialty: Climate Change Soup.
Sorry, but I ordered tomato.
Merely Climate Change, Sir!
Vortex consume, indeed!
Careful, it’s hot.
I knew the atmosphere in here was off.
Is this a single weather event or climate change?
So you’re all out of the beef tournedos?
Tornado, tornahdo… let's just get that salt shall we?
Tomato soup? I thought you said tornado soup.
Tomato. I ordered the tomato soup.
"Tito, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Trust me, gluten is the least of my worries.
I ordered a tempest in a teacup.
If this dish is a South American classic why is its tornado spinning clockwise
Yes... But there ARE no flies, now, are there?
So you would have recommended the salad then?
Waiter, there's an anthropogenic greenhouse imbalance in my soup!
The Tournedos de Boeuf are a bit heavy on the au Poivre.
Sir the hurricane was yesterday’s special
Something tells me it'll be my stomach turning next.
We call it Climate Change Consumme.
And you're sure this is gluten free?
The Chef misunderstood Tournedos!
The soup does have a bit of a kick to it
I asked for tournados not a tornado.
We're known for our funnel cake.
Until now I was a climate change denier.
Sir, I believe he is doing a tremendous backstroke.
Oh, so it has a little kick to it, does it!?
I'm sorry but I only asked for a rich, warm soup, not a simultaneously descending cold front.
Ah, Monsieur!  Vous avez dit "Tournedos" ?!
I ordered the beef tournedos. Where's the beef?
That's exactly why I ordered my soup shaken, not stirred.
I'm told I'm an aggressive stirrer.
My soup forecast called for a drizzle of olive oil.
Must be climate change.
When I ordered Beef Tournedos this wasn't quite what I had in mind.
We recommend that you eat it without your glasses on.
My soup just went from black and white to color.
How much longer will it take to 'breathe' ?
I am sorry waiter.... I had requested only a twist of LEMON.
I'm sure it's delicious, but I ordered the salad
Just the check.
No, no, no. The tomato bisque.
I ordered "Trailer Park Soup - HOLD THE TORNADO!"
You asked the chef to whip up something special for you ...
Does it use imitation sharknado fin, or the real thing?
Soup spoon, please. The large one.
Let me know if you have any questions about the menu.
Excuse me, I think you misunderstood. I ordered the Beef  TOURNEDOS.
So, how did you add this new twist?
Sorry sir, global warming.  Would you prefer the gazpacho?
But I asked for tournedos....
It better be downgraded to a tempest by the time I have my tea.
Excuse me, but I actually ordered the tsunami special.
I need a side of FEMA please!
It does look uplifting.
I didn't order the Climate Change Special.
Would it be possible to turn down the air conditioning?
It's the latest in sous vide, sir.
I'm pretty sure I ordered the tournedos of beef...
Actually, I asked for a twist of lime.
I asked for the tomato soup.
I think you misheard when I said "Thai prune" soup.
Actually, I ordered the beef tornados
On second thought, I think I’ll have the Tournados of Beef.
Do you have any bigger spoons?
So I guess ‘tornado’ soup is a little more serious here in Oklahoma than back home in Idaho!
No tea-cups Sir! We serve our storms in soup bowls!
I assure you sir, it is only a minor climate change event.
The menu didn't mention climate change.
I ordered pho, not typhoon.
Is this due to climate change?
My soup was too hot, so I prayed and asked God to cool it down.
You misheard me - I ordered tomato soup, not tornado soup
Is your hot sauce made in Kansas?
I asked for a calonic, not a cyclonic.
Ahhh, Now I understand what you were referring to by “putting a new spin” on this dish.
Is this soup coming or going?
When I asked whether you had any good tongue twisters I did not expect this!
Excuse me, but there's something in my soup.
Pardon sir, but you misheard. Tornado Bisque is our soup de jour.
I believe the bisque’s a bit over blended
Just some water, please.
All of our specials today come with the proverbial elephant in the room, sir.
I distinctly said shaken, not stirred.
Chef Fieri has really outdone himself.
I thought the menu said Tournedos Soup.
I said just a twist of lemon.
I’m assuming this soup is organic?
We use a cloud kitchen now!
I think I’d like less pepper.
I've heard of a storm in a teacup, but this is ridiculous.
Have you been visualizing whirled peas?
No, not Kansas clam chowder. I said the kind with tomatoes.
“I must apologize, sir.  Our chef just returned from Sedona where he was overly influenced by the spiritual vortex.”
I ordered this in a teacup!
No Parmesan, thanks. Just a raincoat.
Next time can they slice the carrot?
The chef says it's climate change.
I’d say this soup is a category ‘F’
Excellent choice. It goes perfectly with the steak tornado.
What is this...soup or Kansas?
While I appreciate the free refills, the delivery is... a bit much.
We must not be in its eye, garcon, because I am anything but calm.
Don't you think claret is too dry for tornado soup?
Do you have something a little less spicy?
Auntie Em?
This is the last time I'm eating in a trailer park.
Do I look like Dorothy to you? I ordered the earthquake soup!
Soupnado
Tell the chef that this soup blows.
I distinctly asked for Tournedos.
No, it's not that. I don't mind the vortex - I just need another napkin please.
You got any crackers?
Bee soup ? I ordered pea soup.
It was the tournedos Rossini I wanted.
Waiter, I asked for my soup shaken, not stirred.
It's a low front caused by simultaneously running the humidifier and the dehumidifier.
Waiter,what are those flies doing out of my soup?
Could I trouble you for a spoon?
It might hurt a little,  but it won't kill you.
we call it an explosion of flavors.
The chef always adds some last minute ephemeral touches
So,  I suppose this is my souperpower?
Waiter, there is a soup spout in my  bowl.
It seems climate change has taken hold of my tomato bisque.
Pardon me waiter but I have a tornado in my soup.
The chef lost his temper and he apologizes
It's twisting, I'm shouting!
I ordered the tempest in a teapot, not the tornado in the tortellini.
Waiter--this soup is so hot it's generating its own weather.
This cream of tornado soup exceeds my expectations.
Wow, the kitchen really is spiraling out of control.
Oh waiter, there is a tornado in my soup.
Oh, did you say TOMATO soup?
I know it was a favorite, but after 10 years the chef decided to add a few new twists to the menu.
Why would I ask for a soup SPUN?
The menu says the tomato soup comes with croutons. Where are the croutons?
I thought the parsnips would be puréed?
You’re kidding me, this is a cup?!
And the steam over my baked potato said, ‘Surrender Dorothy!’
Which part of tempest in a teapot did you not understand?
Yes, the impact on soup has been much worse more quickly than we predicted.
But I ordered the tempest in a teapot — not the tornado in a bowl.
As climate change continues we will see more and more of these extreme weather events, these "soupnami".
I don't want to be rude, but I think I might need a spoon for this.
I said "Tournedos of BEEF!"
I'm sorry, sir, our blender broke down.
I'm liking the Kansas Clam Chowder.
I thought the twist would be pecorino.
I said I wanted world peace.
I’ll be eating alone. As usual.
Yes. Of course I've heard that climate change can be associated with unexpected and unpredictable atmospheric events.
Waiter, my soup is cold.
Yes sir, that is the soup of the day, and no, you are not in Kansas anymore.
I'll admit that's unusual, but I still say climate change is a hoax.
Is the chef having a bad day?"
'Tornado bisque sir, a specialty of the house"
The spoon sir, you are to eat it with the outermost spoon.
I'm going to need a much larger soup spoon.
Waiter, my soup needs to chill.
And after this, I'll have the beef tournedo.
There must be some mistake. I ordered the tomato soup.
I though you said it was Tomato based!
I don't want to make it a big deal, but I asked for the storm in a teacup, not bowl.
No, I asked for water SPROUTS
It's our house special here at Bible Belt Kitchens.
I specifically asked for cloudy with a chance of meatballs...
I said, sprout soup not soup spout.
This is a tempest in a soup bowl!
...and a little dog, too...
Is this lunch or your daughter's science project ?
I ordered the tempest in a teacup, not the twister in a tureen!
Excuse me, I asked for my storm in a teacup.
My name is not Toto. And yes we are in Kansas.
There are other ways to get the fly out of my soup.
Pardon me, Sir, but you ordered a djinn, straight up.
Either this soup is too hot or your restaurant’s too cold.
This is Dyson soup?
I am quite sure I ordered the TOMATO soup.
I ordered a typhoon. This is spinning to the left.
I ordered cream of tomato.
You'll have to send this back, I ordered TOMATO soup!
Waiter, my Soup there is Flyin'
Would you like the bearnaise or red wine reduction with your tornedos ?
The wine pairing has hints of  plum, blackberries and natural disasters.
No, I ordered mine in a tea pot.
No, you can't blame this on climate change.
Could I get another spoon please?
A fly in my soup I could deal with.
Now that’s authentic Southeastern cuisine.
Backstroke?
Can't you see this fly is doing the twist?
Ketchup in a wine glass and tornadoes in my soup?  Apparently we a ARE in Kansas anymore!
And don’t say, “The backstroke.”
I ordered a Hurricane cocktail, not a tornado soup.
I wanted beef tournedos, not a beefy tornado!
I'll follow this with the tornadoes of beef.
Tomato Soup! NOT......Tornado Soup!
Waiter, there's a drone in my soup.
It needed a vigorous stir.
What's this? I ordered tournedos.
Oh for crying out loud, I specifically asked for the tornado on the side.
I see the chef used the low pressure recipe.
I’m sorry. I thought you ordered cream of tornado
Waiter, there's a no-fly zone in my soup.
I said I can blow on it myself!
So it's not cream of fennel.
Even in Oklahoma, this is not considered tournedos of beef!
I don't want to make a tempest in a teapot but I said Tomato, not Tornado.
I think you have my order confused.   I only wanted my drink with a 'twist' not my soup.
Well, at least it got the fly in the soup.
If you'd prefer, we also have Tornadoes of Beef.
I assumed my tempest in a teapot would arrive before the soup.
Excuse me, but I'm quite certain I said turnedo.
If I had wanted the Polar Vortex, I'd have ordered the Polar Vortex!
If not a spoon, maybe a straw?
We aren’t in Kansas anymore!
waiter there's a tornado in my soup
Excuse me, sir, but I ordered the tomato soup.
How Clark Kent learned not to stir his soup.
I asked for a tempest in a tea pot!
I prefer it shaken, not stirred.
You didn't tell me the Tournedos de Boeuf were on the Fujita scale.
Waiter, I think there’s anti-matter in my soup.
I ordered Tournedos...not the tornado.
Don't just stand there. Go up and close the skylight.
Excuse me, I thought I ordered the hurricane soup.
It's a tad hot.
I’m going to need a bigger spoon.
Can I have vichyssoise instead?
I'll need another soup spoon. And a bib, please?
Pardon me. I'm sure what I asked for was tortellini soup.
Is there a problem with your Maelstrom Minestrone, Sir?
Can I get extra crackers and a raincoat?
Did the chef  REALLY think I wouldn't know the differnence between shark fin and sharknado?
I don't know whether it is coming or going.
So much for playing it safe by ordering the soup instead of the romaine salad.
I ordered the tempest in the teapot, not in the soup!
Sir, I'd like to speak to the chef... I believe his recipe might be a bit twisted.
It's our Super Bowl special--we call it 'Touchdown.'
Excuse me. I asked for the trailer park on the side.
Excuse me, sir. I asked for tomato, not tornado.
Tornados can now be formed over any body of liquid measuring more than six inches in diameter
The chef’s recipe requires vigorous whisking. He’s very good.
This is going to do a number on my anus
You are sure.  No extra charge?
pardonnez-moi Monsieur, but did the gentleman not request un house specialty, la soupe de tornade?  May I suggest, as is traditional à Paris, the gentleman samples from an angle oblique to the direction of  spin?
Can you close the window? There's a bit of a draft.
Excuse me, but I only ordered the teacup.
Farm fresh from Alabama, sir.
It's the polar vortex, sir.
Could you now bring me my tempest in a teapot?
Where's the teacup?
Waiter, there appears to be an f-5 in my soup.
So you say blowing on it will cool it off some?
I think I asked for tomato soup.
Waiter,  I ordered steak tournedos.
But I distinctly said “Beef Tournedos”!
It's traditionally midwestern, but ours are hyperlocal.
Waiter, what's this flying out of my soup.
Excuse me. I ordered tomato soup, not tornado soup.'
You ordered tomato soup, sir? I'm sorry, I thought you said 'tornado'"
I'm sorry you misunderstood me. I said chocolate volcano not soufflé tornado for dessert
I ordered the “tournedos au poivre”!
Send it back.  I ordered Tournedo de Boeuf”
Remember when we only had to worry about tempests in teapots?
I believe I ordered the hurricane chili.
No, tomato doesn't sound anything like tornado.
I don't mean to complain, but this soup is so hot it's making it's own weather.
"I asked for the Tournedos of beef?
No, waiter, I said `tomato,' not `tornado.'
I distinctly ordered a rustic waterspout soup and instead you present me with this tourin de tornade.
Is this rare?
Is it true the soup here will blow you away??
Does it cause bloating?
Waiter, there's a Kansan in my soup.
This is the soup du jour?  I thought you said it was tomato.
There’s probably a fly in my soup.
I did mention the draft ...
Fork, knife, SPOON; not fork, spoon, knife!  I'd like to speak to the manager.
Should I wait for the tornado part to settle a bit?
Are you sure about the Cabernet?
Yes Sir, state your wish. I am the genie of the soup-bowl.
The chef has matched this with the tornedos to follow.
First there was only one fly, and then the others colluded
I thought I ordered this in a teapot.
Waiter, there's a cyclone in my soup.  I ordered a tornado.
You'll be blown away by Chef Fujita's cream of tornado soup, sir."
I specifically told you that I was allergic to waterspouts.
I'm afraid it's due to global warming.
You're right. Waterspout does taste a little like chicken.
Genetically modified curry.
No, what I actually ordered was a tournedo.
I said I wanted Tomato soup not Tornado soup!
Excuse me, but this isn't my order. I ordered the Tomato soup not the Tornado soup."
If it's a sign, I'm stumped.
Waiter, there’s a flyclone in my soup!

No, I distinctly asked for the tournedos.
You can ignore that, sir; it's just a minor side effect of excessive soup warming.
I hope this doesn't mean President Trump will be visiting me.
But the menu clearly read "in a teapot"!
Chicken soup.  I've been feeling under the weather.

Have you got anything with a little less global warming?
The kitchen is a whirlwind of culinary experimentation.
Waiter, there's an elephant trunk in my soup.
I'll have a hurricane with that.
I ordered tournedos,idiot!!
Waiter there is something in my soup
This soup was specially prepared by your mother-in-law.
This dish just explodes with flavor!
The storm du jour, sir.
This is a mistake; I ordered the jalapeño hurricane.
Is this related to climate change?
And I suppose the Cowardly Lion,  the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow will escort me out of here.?
There must be a mistake I ordered the tomato soup
Why the giant carrot?

What's the second course?
You sure this is french?
More beef less tornado please.
I'm feeling a little under-the-weather.

Waiter! What's this twister doing in my soup? And don't tell me it's doing the backstroke, it's going  counter-clockwise, I'm up on all your Groucho Marx smart-alecky repartee.

Global warming is ruining everything.
How is everything?

No, I actually ordered the "Tournedos Rossini".
I though I was ordering the Beef Tournedos?!?!?
It's our climate change clam chowder.

I suppose climate change is real after all.
It's self cooling!

Waiter, I believe I actually ordered the Beef Tournedos.
I asked for my order, not chaos.
Is this a Nor'Easter or a Pineapple Express?
Can they take the funnel out of it?
Chef’s nod to Tornado Season Sir
But I ordered the tournedos starter.
I said TOMATO sauce.
Tornado..lini soup de jour sir... with a twist

You said the soup was divine, but I wasn’t expecting the finger of God!
I said I wanted "Tomato" soup....
Waiter, there is a flying witch in my tornado soup.
You may have stirred your soup a little too vigorously.
Interesting presentation but how do I eat it?
Free with the Polar Vortex Prix Fixe!
'If you survive your meal it's free!
Oh, you really did mean storm-to-table dining! I thought it was a typo...
I specifically said “Dorothy-free”
Could I get some polar with this vortex?
Yes, well, the potato is leaking.
What's this tornado doing in my soup "?
" The twist sir"
I ordered the soup shaken, not stirred.
I love the metaphor, but how does it taste?
Waiter there is too much turbinado in my butternut soup.
I must have the recipe.
On second thought, make it a straw.
Did I say tomato? I meant tornado soup.
Doesn't this come with a side salad?
I was okay with the concept of molecular gastronomy. But atmospheric gastronomy is a bridge too far.
Sir, I apologize. We are fresh out of Tempest in a Teapot!
We call it Tomato Tornado. I recommend it over the sauerkraut tsunami.
You have an unusual way of mixing the greens.
Don't you have any less drastic way of cooling the soup?
Sorry, but I ordered tournedos of BEEF
The new spin on the minestrone is a bit much.
Really, I specifically said, "NO Twister"
You ordered the twister, what did you expect?

Looks like your chef stirred it a little too briskly.
There’s a flynado in my soup.
This looks good, but I asked for the tomato soup.
Very hot sir, just as you ordered.
You say, "Torn-ado." I say, "Tornado." But with what do I eat?
I know gazpacho is meant to be served cold, but not with a polar vortex!
I must insist! I requested "tomato" soup!
We need to alk about the elephant in the room.
It's a twist on the classic Minestrone soup.
Could I also get a side order of  a tempist in a teapot?
May I have some bread, please?
I'm sorry sir that you find it disconcerting, the other guest viewed it as free entertainment.
This must be a mistake. I ordered the BEOUF tournedos.
Hail to the chef. Also lightning.
We attribute it to global warming
Remember when we used to think having a fly in our soup was bad?

Have you decided on the entree?
Excuse me, but I order a molten lava cake.
Well, pardon me for thinking “Tormato Soup” was just a clever name.

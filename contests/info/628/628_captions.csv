I heard today I'm getting canned.
Whaddya mean you only serve fish on Friday
What the hell else would I drink like?
Just the worm, hold the Tequila.
Yeah? Well I'm also a fish out of Scotch.
Maybe one day she’ll realize I’m the one that got away.
It’s just so hard not to get wrapped up in the news.
I KNOW when something is watered down, pal.
'She says she needs room to breathe...what does that even mean?'
Then one day you wake up and you have ten thousand children and a mortgage that's under water.
They sent me to rehab to dry out - damn near killed me
Every single school rejected me.
And that fisherman had to be 7 or 8 feet tall
I hope this isn't a place where people come to hook up.
She's sleeping with the fishes. Just not this one.
Stop calling me chum!
Make it a double. I just got out of the tank.
I had a castle and treasure chest before my life went down the toilet.
Leave the tequila, I'll just take the worm.
So then I tell her, ‘Well after two days your mother stinks too.’
Well, what else did you expect me to drink like?
Your sign clearly says We serve fish!
Well, I bet you drink like a bald guy
I came here to get a job on Wall Street, but it turns out they only hire sharks and piranhas.
You have no idea how hard it is to get a dry martini where I come from.
Sure, but a horse walks into a bar and nobody bats an eye
At this point, I'm more of a fish out of bourbon.
I don't know why I can't meet anyone.  I'm quite the catch.
Pisces... what’s yours.
...And then she gave me this koi smile.
I'm not making this up, she wants us to get a cat.
I still like to think of myself as a good catch.
... but TEACH a fish to drink, and he can drink for a lifetime.
If the aquarium calls, I ain't here.
Scotch, neat. And don't tap on the glass.
Yes, but interestingly, I don’t drink like one.
...and before I knew it,I'd fallen for her - hook,line,and sinker.
Large water. Salted. And keep'em coming.
I was swimming upstream like everyone else, leaping up falls and stuff, and then I asked myself—why?
The mustache is fine for you, Bart. On me it screams "CATFISH!"
And then, would you believe it, she tells me, ‘There’s plenty of fish in the sea!’
If I had wanted water I would have stayed where I was.
I just got out of the can.
give me a double, I'm getting canned tomorrow
Can you sprinkle some food in the next one?
She's freshwater, I'm saltwater. It just wasn't gonna work.
Can I get some chips?
This is what happens when you drain the swamp.
I can’t believe she left me for that shrimp.
First off, I didn't WALK into this bar...
So what did one Jewish Mama-fish say to another Jewish Mama-fish? She said, 'I'm so proud of my son, the sturgeon!'
Drowning my sorrows?  Is that a joke?
Any bar snacks other than Goldfish?
I’m waiting for the priest and the rabbi.
Since The Shape of Water, I've been beating women off with a stick!
Yes, I DO drink like a fish. What a fresh, amusing observation.
I was let go today.
So I said to her, "Kiss me." and wouldn't you know it, I'm no longer a frog.
You try and run a school all day.
Yes, but I have a dry sense of humor.
It's OK, man - I'll take the Hudson home.
. . . And don’t get me started on Roe v. Wade
I've had too much?!  You're the one who thinks I'm a giant fish!
No, but I swear like a sailor
Really, my name is Wanda.
I'll tell you the rest of the story when the Priest and the Rabbi get here.
I took the 5 from Fulton and transferred to the Q. How did YOU get here?
I tell all the girls that I'm rich in Omega-3.
What’s the matter?  You never  seen a pickled herring?
I ain't drinking any water. Me and my friends pee in it all the time.
... so I sez to the Genie, “Thanks for the  billion dollars and eternal youth. I wanna drink like fish tonight to celebrate.“
I got taken in by a hooker
I've been dry for a year now.
Glad I made it through another Friday.
Catch and release.” “Catch and release.”  How about “DON’T CATCH!
You drink like a fish” she says. Well, of COURSE I drink like a fish
Don’t look at me like that! I was told this was a dive bar.
Why isn't there another sole in here?
So, do you believe in climate change now?
And furthermore, don’t call me ‘Chum’!
Is it true you have to go to a special place to pee?
Carp diem.
Of course, you know who kept the castle when we moved into separate bowls.
Drinks like a fish?  Cold as a fish?  How do I stop the profiling, Al?
That's actually a simile, not a metaphor.
I've been told I should go with the white wine.
Yeah, well, you pour like a turtle.
No, I drink like a guy who watches the news.
Buddy, I just fertilized a thousand eggs today. Another round.
Down there, we call it drinking like a writer.
"They called it a funeral, but all they did was flush Jimmy down the toilet."
Well, how else WOULD I drink?
Skip the tequila and just give me the worm
And the fisherman I pulled into the water was 7' feet 7 inches and weighed 375 pounds.
"Sign outside says you serve fish.
Yes, I *do* drink like a fish!
Being a big fish in a small pond is over-rated.
Don't get me going on Roe v. Wade!
and I drink like one too; so keep my tab open
I don't care what white wine goes with, bring me a scotch!
I may be farm raised, but I couldn’t resist the lure of city life.
I want top shelf stuff this time.  No more bait and switch.
You’re out of water? So am I.
I'm meeting a rabbi and a priest.
A double scotch neat and if the aquarium calls you haven't seem me.
I’m not kidding you. The guy was THIS BIG!
No, pal, I don't drink like a fish.  I drink "as" a fish!
Remember me? 2006,  Bear Lake? You don't look so tough without that fishin' pole in your hand, mister...
One tequila with two worms.
I knew Flipper before he was an asshole
Well, how do think they make pickled herring?
Y'know when people say "he drinks like a fish"... I'm that fish.
...and then she says to me, 'Go spawn yourself'.
So she said "what on earth are you going to do with a bicycle'?"
Yes, and you drink like a human. What’s your point?
I'm sorry, but we only serve fish on Fridays.
Really? I bet you'd serve me if I was filleted in a lemon butter sauce.
I'm just tired of all the carping.
Reached my limit? I'm a fish, you idiot!
She was called Wanda.
I don't think I can walk out of here.
But not TOO dry, right?"
Can you put on the Marlins' game
Look, I don't blame you. You were just a kid then, how could you have known? But the toilet, Roger... the toilet.
Tequila shot...with the worm.
Yeah, but I tip like a whale
I don't care if it's bad for me, I want a plastic straw.
I'll have the chips
When climate change floods this dump, you'll be the one gasping for breath, amigo.
Listen Cueball, I'm up to my gills in work, I'm swimming in debt, and my love life's in the tank, so maybe it's you who should switch to water!
He said I was too koi.
I've had enough? I'm not the one hallucinating a giant, talking fish.
Gimme a shot of the East River.
Next thing I know, Jimmy Hoffa floats by.
Water. Salty.
What do you mean you don't serve fish except on Friday?
And then she left me, high and dry.
And just where am I supposed to get a shirt and shoes?
We met on HOOKED.COM
I know, I should be in a school right now...
YEAH,YEAH, I KNOW. I DRINK LIKE A FISH.
Understand something, I drink BECAUSE I’m a fish.
A trout, a haddock, and a squid walk into a bar...…..
You know, now that you mention it, I actually AM a big fish in a small pond.
She caught me and then released me - story of my life.
...so then he says, "There's something fishy here," and they all turn to look at ME!
I'm sorry, I was told this was a dive bar.
I get that a lot, but Capote wore glasses.
I fell in love with a hooker.
I feel so used: She let me fertilize her eggs and I never saw her again!
Who are you callin' chum?
And you drink like a person. Your point?
A soon as you go belly up in this town, they flush you down the toilet.
Another tequila with worm. Hold the tequila.
So the guy who nearly hooked me was huge - at least ten feet, 400 pounds.
Not one of my seven thousand kids call me.
I just know I’m going to get canned.
We met on line, but after the first date, I was hooked.
Hey, I'm out of water again.
Can you please  put the Marlin’s game on?
I'm not out of water, I'm out of whiskey!
Yeah? At least I don't smoke like a chimney.
Saying I drink like a fish isn't helping matters.
Yes, I do drink like a fish. So what?
What else would I drink like??!!!
I was supposed to meet a rabbi and a priest here.
Lately Bob I feel like I'm floundering
I AM the one who got away.
We were smooching and going to make babies...and then she left me for a guy with a fishing pole and a yacht.
A bar fly, please.
Do I tell you you've had too much to breathe?
...and then she called me a cold fish.
Of course I drink like one. What did you expect?
If I wanted water in my scotch I'd drink at home.
There ain't another sole in this place.
...And then she said it would never work because I was raised on a farm.
... and then I told Mrs. Paul where she can stick it.
Yes, I am out of water, but I'm out of bourbon too.
You heard me, 10 gallons of water and a large bowl.
So, one day I thought what if I do need a bicycle.
Why yes. I am transitioning.
I can't drown my sorrows about my 1174 children who never call me.
So, the waitress says ‘Do you want anchovies on that?’ ...and I just looked at her.
So I told her, "Yeah? Well you eat like a pig."
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a bicycle, would you?
You think you got a dysfunctional family? Listen, Tony, all my brothers are bottom feeders, and my sister married a loan shark.
Hold the tequila. Keep the worm.
Got change for a fin?
I'm trying to scale back.
Still think climate change is fake news?
Trust me, I'll be a mermaid nearer to closing time.
I was told this was a WET bar
Yes, you can call me Wanda if you like.
And   then the president drained the swamp....
I eat like a fish too, ok?
Before the divorce, I lived in a castle.
One more for the road.  I have a designated diver.
Looks like you and I have the same barber.
I'm not leaving here until I get tanked!
You’re kidding! A horse walked into a bar?
They always say, "A fish walked into a bar..." but they never stop to think how.
For the last time, it's "large" mouth, not "big."
I coulda been Catch Of the Day.
I coulda been a contender.
Where are all the barflys?
I'm not driving.
Seriously, I'm a good catch.
Yea, I'll tell you what's sick, "Catch of the Day", that's...sick.
You're goddamn right I drink like a fish!
Not a problem. I know a guy who can get you off the hook.
So, the fella at the helm was 8 feet tall and 600 pounds, easy.
So little Ms. Mermaid runs off with the handsome prince, and I'm stuck with the 1,237 kids.
Let me tell you man. There are NOT  plenty of fish in the sea.
Can you believe it? I win a damn Oscar and now I can't get cast.
Then she said," You're not the only fish in the sea."
When I was younger, I was the catch of the day.
So apparently asking if she'd like to sleep with the fishes isn't the stellar pick up line I'd imagined.
It's hard to find a neighborhood bar that serves fish.
Water?!  No way. Do you know what I do in water?
It was at this moment that Steve began to regret the mushrooms he'd taken before work.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen, and keep 'em coming.
Ten thousand little mouths to feed. 
I just couldn't take the pressure
And, his policies are ruining our schools.
Mezcal with TWO worms, please.
Well, if you’re cutting ME off, then it’s time I get to the point. ‘Member the goldfish you flushed when you was six? Yep, that’s right, Billy, it’s me. Mr. Mothaflipping Gulp Gulp.
I prefer being a big fish in a small bar.
I’m just killing time until the tide comes in.
I'd like something  dry.
You just called me "Donald."  I'm a grouper.  Not a groper.
Yeah...I'll have another. I'm off the hook tonight.
Actually, most of us prefer red wine.
I got free lip piercing today.
It’s okay—I’m an Emotional Support Fish.
And a little something for the seahorse I rode in on.
I'm just saying that a guy without gills selling Bass Ale is culturally appropriative.
Don't worry about it, I came here on my bike.
If you tell me, "there are plenty of fish in the sea," one more time...
I used to drink like a sailor.
Which raises an interesting question - Is it worse to be a fish out of water, or a bartender out of scotch?
Yeah?  And you bartend like a bald guy!
So I told her it was me or her cat.
You are talking to a fish on a barstool and you say I'm drunk?
You think I'm trying to be koi?
Yes, I said extra dry.
She had this way of making me feel like I was the only fish in the sea.
Yes, I saw "The Shape of Water." No, I don't know him.
I tried going dry, but it didn't work for me.
and I smoke like a chimney.
What!  Never seen a fish out of water?
Hey, Mister--my eyes are up here!
I just know I'm getting canned tomorrow.
Worm--and hold the tequila."
Yeah well YOU drink like a bald guy with a stupid mustache.
... so I say "Well of course I drink like one - what did you expect?"
When I said fill it to the gills,
whose gills do you think I meant?!
The guy I got away from was over 8 feet tall and must have weighed more than 400 pounds!
I've been caught and released so many times, I've lost my self-esteem.
Make it one for my baby, and one more for the roe.
And make it a double...I'm on shore leave.
This time make sure there’s a worm in my tequila!
All I remember is that we met online.
Listen, pal, I don't mind being a fish out of water. I do mind being a fish out of Scotch.
Teach a man to buy me a drink.
You promised me barflies, Steve...Where are the barflies??
Don’t judge, Mac, it was a rough day. My buddies are covered in wasabi right now.
I was the one that got away.
I'm supposed to find fault with every little thing. I'm a carp.
Yeah? Well you pour like a girl.
And just like that, she flushed me down the toilet.
No, I don’t want to see the sushi menu.
Not true. I drink like a human.
What does that even mean.... drink like a fish?
Flush yourself, I told her.
I just wasn’t gonna be someone’s trophy, you know?
I SAID one more!  You got a herring problem?
Well, I'm tired of your carping too.
Does Tom Hanks still come in here?  He used to date 
my sister.
She said she didn't need me. Then she took my bicycle.
Water. Neat. And keep it coming.
I was dating this mermaid, But she left me for an octopus. I mean how can you compete with that?
I can't believe someone would steal my bicycle.  I really needed it.
Well, your sign said, ‘We serve fish.’
I got a feeling they're going to can me at work tomorrow.
Water, and make it snappy. I'm dying here.
Really? My brother was in here last night? Total fluke.
At twenty bucks a martini it's no wonder you don't get many fish in here!
I really shouldn't. I have a tendency to get hooked.
I am scaling back"
...And put it in a dirty glass, I intend to get polluted.
You think that's something?  Well I had to swim upstream the entire length of the Columbia River over rapids and past marauding bears just for a one night stand!
'Listen, bub, if you knew sushi like I knew sushi...'
What do you mean “stop being Koi”?
Don't give me that 'no shoes, no shirt, no service' line ...
Where I come from, every bar's a dive.
And don't think I won't know if you water it down.
Got any of those little people crackers ?
LIMMERICK: A big mouthed bass name of Nick...was feeling a bit ichthyonic...He drank like a fish...And had only one wish..."Just give me one more gin and tonic."
It’s an unfortunate stereotype. I’m here for the pretzels.
I'll need more than just a splash.
I’m salmon on my mother’s side but I don’t look it.
I bet you always thought it was just a saying.
Yeah, it was never going to work. Her mother never approved of the school I was in.
And how exactly did you think Herring got pickled?
Hey, I know what we do in the water. I'll take it neat.
Yeah, I'm supposed to meet a friend here...he wears an antique diving suit and pops out of a treasure chest
One more for the river.
Of all the gin joints and aquariums in all the world and I meet G. Gordon Liddy.
I told her, 'those eggs look nothing like me.'"
Bourbon and water.  Hold the bourbon.
Are you trying to bait me?
Woman trouble? Are you kidding? Since the Godfather movies, nobody wants to sleep with the fishes!
I'm a good catch right ?
I want the one with the worm.
What wine would you recommend for trout?
Of course I'm not driving home.  You think I want to end up in the tank?
...sure, I know how to drink like one, but learning English was harder
Biggest damn fisherman you ever saw, twelve feet tall if he was an inch. Would've had him, but the line broke.
Last I heard, she was headed upstream.
When do the mermaids usually show up?
I just told her to fish or cut bait, and she took me literally...
Do I look like I drove here ?
Who you calling a hooker?
This town will eat you alive.
I could use a bowl of water... if it’s not too much trouble.
Not only am I a, 'fish out of water' I'm a fish out of money.
And NO plastic straws, thank you!
You don't know how tired I am of hearing "Holy Mackerel " every time I come in this watering hole.
It’s going swimmingly, but suddenly on day three she tells me I stink.
He said he had bigger fish to fry!
Back in my day, we had to swim upstream, both ways!
My first wife thought I was quite a catch.
I assure you, I'm not being koi.
The guy who hooked me had to be at least 6'7" and 275 pounds... He was huge.
All he ever wants to do is play catch and release.
How many more shots ‘til I get to the worm?
Bass. Sea Bass.
When the rabbi and the priest get here,tell them the fish is waiting for them..
Maybe YOU'VE had too much to BREATHE!
I love this watering hole
Do you have any idea how much it takes to drown my sorrows?
Yeah?  Well there’s something “mannish” about you!
You're cutting me off? You're the one talking to a fish.
I’m telling you he was at least 10 feet tall.
Hey pal! If I wanted water in my drinks, I'd just stay at home.
So I says to her: "Baby, there are plenty of other fish in the sea."
Sorry, no sauce for you. We only serve Fish on Fridays.
Yeah, I was in a private school. It was just sink or swim.
Grow some legs she said. Yeah, that will just take about 400 million years.
And don't even get started with that "drink like a..."
There are NOT plenty of fish in the sea once you turn 40, Carl!
The only thing worse than a fish out of water is a bar out of gin.
...and the worst part is, I fell for it too. Hook, line, and sinker.
Did you think it was just an expression?
So I said, where is the nearest lagoon, and he thought I said saloon.
Well, if I'm a bottom-feeder, what does that make this place?
After you flushed me down the toilet, I thought I would never see you again.
So what the Hell did you expect me to drink like?
I thought that it would be more enjoyable getting polluted here  than in the river.
Oh yeah? Well,I drink like one too!
Would you say I'm a good catch?
I need to get tanked and make it quick.
Well, of course I drink like a fish. What else am I going to drink like??
If I wanted water, I would’ ve stayed home.
Nothing right now. I'm trying to scale back.
You'll see more of us with this global warming!
Do I look like I want it dry?
I found Nemo, but now I’m really trying to find myself.”
How much am I on the hook for?
She left me for a goldfish. EVERYONE wants a goldfish. Just you wait, in a ​few weeks that relationship will be down the drain.
Yeah but I swim like a man
Food pellets, koi pond, and 500,000 kids...she got it all in the divorce.
Out of water? What kind of a bar runs out of water?
Do you ever feel like your whole existence is just a setup for a bad joke?
You think it's easy to drown my sorrows?
Line'em up, I have a reputation to uphold.
Something bracing. I've been swimming with the sharks all day.
This is a dive, right?
I'm looking for  a fish called Wanda
Buddy, I’ve been in ponds that are less watered down.”
I'm not as fish as you drunk I am.
So? You breath like a human!
I'd rather hang around the bar than over the mantel.
I’m trying to get filleted tonight,if you catch my drift.
I don't want you to give me a drink; I want you to teach me how to drink.
Keep 'em coming, I have a reputation to uphold.
Turns out there aren’t plenty of fish in the sea, after all.
And let me tell you, they got a lot wrong in The Shape of Water.
Why does everyone assume I'm a Pisces?
If I wanted water with my scotch would I be in here?
Another martini, Joe. I'm gonna get tanked tonight.
I drink to deal with the trolling.
I’m going to smack that New Yorker intern who selects a lame “drink like a fish” caption for the top 3.
Oh yeah? What am I supposed to drink like?
And you know what, it would be nice if- just once- these mobsters would ask if I wanted to sleep with any of these people.
If it looks like a fish, and drinks like a fish, it's probably a fish
Everyone in my school had a drinking problem.
Hey, Bub, I'm out of water.
That part was perfect for me, but Tom Hanks wanted Darryl Hannah.
Just so you know, I am offended equally by "stewed to the gills" and "drinks like a fish".
Sometimes I feel like a fish out of water.
They keep saying Gill, 'there's plenty of fish in the sea', but you look around I swear it's all plastic.
If you knew what we do in the water, you would stick to scotch too!
Evolution is for quitters!
Another double water on the rocks, please.  And hold the clichés.
Scotch, and 100 gallons of water.
Yes, I'm out of water, but not out of money. Keep it flowing."
Let me have a tequila with a worm and hold the tequila.
I'm here to get tanked!
Don't judge. I got hooked.
And then she took my bicycle and left.
I'll have a pure Sea Water.  Neat. No plastic.
Scotch and salt water.
Water.....neat.
Yes, I drink like like a fish, so what?
School was just not my thing.
But all she cares about is what school I went to.
My life’s headed straight down the toilet.
Well, YOU drink like a bartender.
No, I am not tanked!
It’s just a midstream crisis.
I'm drowning in debt, I can't float a loan, and my business is under water. Martini - very dry.
Hey, I got one for ya. What did the fish say when he swam into a concrete wall?

Damn!
Last time I date a witch.
If you're seeing a fish, you're the one that's had enough.
Carp diem," that's what I always say.
What do you mean, "Be wary of Russian hookers?"
They want to arm our schools?!
I’ll know if you’re watering the drinks.
Ever think maybe you smell a little "Humany?"
That will do.  I don’t want to have to 
crawl out of here.
I’ve been dealing with sharks at work all day. Make it a double!
Is your scotch wild or farm raised?
Certainly I want that with water
She fed me a line and here I am.
My God, how hard can this be? Just put the water 
in a plastic bag.
Tell em, Mackie's back in town.
I miss the dive bar.
As soon as I saw her, I was hooked.
Rejected? She flushed me down the toilet!
Scotch and water ... and hold the scotch.
But don't you think I'd make a great catch?"
Thirty years on the job and they replace me with some big fish just out of school...
I'm telling you, pal, he was so big I couldn't get him outta the boat!!
I can’t believe she was using me for bait.
So then she says “I don’t think we should spawn anymore, but we can still be friends...”
It all started when they flushed me down the toilet!
Line 'em up. I've got a reputation to defend.
Water, straight. And keep 'em coming
It turned out to be just another line.
Okay one more shot, but this time I want a worm in it!
Call me Fishmael.
What do you mean, stewed to the gills?
The problem is, I can’t drown my sorrows.
I am out celebrating my promotion. Tomorrow I am being featured as the ‘catch of the day’!
Set 'em up Joe_I've got a little tail you ought to know.
I’m sick and tired of living my life in a fishbowl.
All men want these days is a nice piece of bass.
I’m beginning to feel somewhat out of my depth here...
Oh yeah? Well, you pour like a bald guy!
Just water, thanks.
Not too dry
Mezcal staight up, extra worm, hold the hook.
If I could drown my sorrows underwater, I wouldn't be here.
Gimme a grasshopper.
And then she tells me she’s a pescatarian.”
You know, we have a saying too: "You breathe like a human." It ain't a compliment.
Sorry.  We only serve fish on Good Friday.
They drained the swamp.
How many times have YOU been caught and released?
I've been told this is an upscale establishment.
No, I didn't WALK into a bar.
She was looking to hook up.  I just wanted to troll.
I'll admit it-I got hooked on one of your bar flies.
So glad you threw out the “no shirt, no shoes..” policy, Carl.
Personally, I happen to think sea level rise is a good thing.
Just the chips, no fish.
And then, BAM!   It hits me...I DO drink like a fish!!  So why fight it
At least I’m not drunk as a skunk
I'm getting out of the upstream-to-spawn grind; I found a nice quiet aquarium, complete with a little castle.
So this is what you call a dive bar?
Ten thousand gallons of water, neat, in your largest plastic bag. And don’t forget the twist.
You ever felt like a fish outta' water?
I want a martini ... and it BETTER NOT BE DRY!
So now I'm a fish out of bourbon too?
No salt on the rim, I'm fresh water.
Sorry, we only serve fish on Fridays
Humans would drink this much, too, if you spawned 6 thousand kids a year and any piece of food you bit into might be a hook.
A metaphor often feels like a fish out of water. But a simile sits quietly, drinking like a fish.
What's your poisson?
If a halibut calls, I’m not here.
This is really hard to explain, but I'm also going to need a bicycle.
I should've stayed in school.
.... tell me about it. I have more than 10,000 kids,  and I don't have a good relationship with any of them!
And then I was up for the lead in 'Flipper," but no, they had to have a guy with a blowhole and a goofy accent.
And quit calling me 'Chum"!
Have I told you the one about how I got away?
And that's why I'm never going back to my old school.
Tab please, I think I'll head home, spawn and die now.
I think I'll go with a white wine.
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish — doesn’t matter, I’ve slept with ‘em all.
I just can't seem to keep my head above water.
I'm looking for a long-term relationship. I'm tired of being the one that got away.
Back in the day I was a beautiful mermaid.  And then along came Ariel...that bitch.
Don’t say it! I can stop any time I want.
Yes I’m emotional, I flushed my wife today. Now pour me another.
She asked me to swim upstream with her. But I'm not that kind of a fish.
I'm waiting for my solemate."
Beefeaters please.
First of all, a fish can't walk into a bar.
Not too drunk to ride my bicycle.
If it's Dory, I ain't here!
How do you know there are plenty of fish in the sea?
Have you tried fish oil for that hair loss?
If they call from Fulton's, don't tell them I'm here.
I just feel like life has no porpoise.
Anything, as long as it's not on the rocks.
YOU wait an hour before swimming.
Do you have change for a fin?
Go Fish my ass, we're playing poker this time!
....out of water. Good one.
I'm telling you that guy was huge, at least eight feet tall and all muscle, but I pulled him right into the lake!
Water. Keep it coming.
I'm looking for Wanda.
I’ll take a water with a splash of salt
Not everyone supports draining the swamp.
Then I dropped out of school...
So she lays 50,000 eggs into a little pit in the gravel. Is that supposed to turn my crank?
I started drinking after I dropped out of school
Water and a large bowl.
Hence, the simile.
I need a drink. I feel like a fish out of water.
Go easy - I'm already tanked.
Don’t even get me started on pescatarians
My wife made me shave mine off.
Donald Trump doesn't know the first thing about 'catch and release', believe me.
Drink like a fish?  No, never heard that one before
That's enough for me. I have to swim home.
That's large mouth not big mouth.
What happened? You used to pack 'em in like sardines here.
I was sent to tell you one more missed payment and you’ll be swimming with me!
Pretty soon I'll be tanked.
It's an upstream battle.
I bet you'd serve me if I were a mermaid.
No, I'm not a fish out of water. I'm a fish out of bourbon. Another double, bartender. And pronto.
He left me high and dry.
Look he knew I was a GOLDFISH before he married me!
I came here for compliments
NO SALT!
Seen any hookers in here?"
What I'm saying is there's gotta be more to life than just "spawn and die".
Good to be here Joe, I almost didn't get away this time.
...and that’s how I got hooked.
I don't mean to be Koi, Roy.  Just listen to me.
I don't drive. Would you take my school I.D.?
If I'm home late again, she'll batter me.
She left when she saw I was farm raised.
Hey we have the same haircut
Put. Those. Straws. Away.
Light on the tequila, heavy on the worm.
I’m in the neighborhood house hunting. In a few years this is going to be prime off-shore real estate.
I'm telling you, it's not easy being the one who got away.
I'm benthic. She's pelagic. It just didn't work out.
Can’t take the thought of getting back to school
And it was after I swallowed two plastic straws in one day when I just said  enough with the ocean, I'm out!
H2O up straight please!
"Do you serve fish on Fridays?  Yes or no?
Long time no sea.
Just in here looking for a piece of bass
Damn right, I drink like a fish.
What do you mean no shoes no service?
I'm a fish out of alcohol.
I am looking for a worm. He is probably hiding in one of your tequila bottles.
The next guy who says "I bet you drink like a fish" gets a fin in the face!
Did I tell you about the time I dropped out of school?
I told you I could drink like a fish.
No way. I piss in the water.
No, I really mean it -- I'm not being koi!
Carp, carp, carp. That's all she does.
So, long story short, I kissed the mermaid.
Yeah? Well, we say "drunk as a bald bartender", so back atcha.
She said there were plenty of other fish in the sea
What was I two drinks ago?
Level with me - I'm washed up, aren't I?
What do you mean you don't serve fish?
There aren't. There aren't plenty of fish!
I also plan to smoke like a chimney. Wanna make something of it?
... and don't go telling me there are other fish in the sea.
Yes, wise-guy, I'm the one that got away.
Trust me, there are not plenty of fish in the sea.
I'm just tired of dating betas.
Are you trying to kill me? I said no salt on the rim!
Of course I want salt on that margarita. Do I look like a fresh water fish?
I'm not out of water, idiot, I'm out of whiskey!
Koi, not coy.
You got anything to nibble on?
You know I don't have to come HERE to get polluted.
I guess you don't recognize me.  I used to be small and orange.
He scribbled down his number and said, "Call me, Ishmael," but I knew he was just feeding me a line.
I'm telling you, it's sink or swim out there.
No shit, Sherlock.
That last martini was too dry.
It's not against the law to drink and swim, so don't start telling me when you think I've had enough!
I've learned to live with it --  a few drinks, and I get all Koi
I'm fixing to get stewed to the gills.
Your window says you serve fish.
Evolution is fake news
A fish out of water ALWAYS drinks like a fish.
What do you mean my ID looks fishy?
Skip the drink. I'll have just a grasshopper.
Ha, ha. ‘Drink like a fish’, never heard that one before.
Louie, you now know how pickled herring become pickled herring.
Things are great! No hard feelings about flushing me down the toilet.
These shots are good, but I really want more of those barflies.
I’m a fish out of water, and I’m out of water.
Ariel changed, man. She really changed.
I'm perched.
I can't believe she left me for that cod.
But, man, she was one alluring hooker.
Polar ice caps are melting, oceans are warming and food supply is dwindling - so don't tell me to calm down!
Just for fun - sparkling water
It's me, Harry. I'm the victim of a phishing scam.
Dropped out of my school, and never looked back!
So that’s when she said she had it up the gills with me.
You hear the one about the shark, the dolphin and the manta ray swim into a sand bar?
Dropping out of my school to pursue soccer was my first mistake! I'm too afraid of the net.
I'll have a scotch and water. Lots of water.
Can you switch the TV to the Marlins game?
I don't understand. Her dating profile said she liked swimmers bodies.
I'd like a barfly.
Do you have paper straws?
Tonight I’m getting tanked.
One more, then flush me home.
I don’t care if you believe it or not. 
Ancestry.com says that you’re my father!
keep them coming -- if I pass out, you can hang me out to dry.
Set me up with a double water and keep em coming.
I'm not driving, thank you. I rode my bicycle.
Yes, I'm carping.  What did you expect?
Yes, I'm new here - fresh off the boat as a matter of fact.
...My old man just got sent up the river.
I only seem koi.
A tuna, a grouper, and a shark walk into a bar ....
I'm celebrating my anniversary.  I'm the one that got away.
And then I says to the guy, I says - Joe, they got you hook, line and sinker.
Of all the gin joints in the world,I have to walk into the only one that sells sushi.
...and right in the middle of it all, she calls me NEMO!
I'm gonna need a designated swimmer.
Come on... just one more for the river.
She had me hook, line and sinker.
Oh yeah, wiseguy? And what, pray tell, SHOULD I be drinking like?
Last time I saw her, she said she’d drop me a line. I should have known then it was over.
You don't serve fish huh?  Then give me a hamburger.
On the rocks? What am I, a starfish?
If I pass out, call a taxi instead of flushing me down the toilet.
Don’t worry, I have a designated swimmer.
Yeah, well you’re bald.
No, I REALLY need to get tanked.
One disadvantage is we cannot drown our sorrows
I tried that line, but she still wouldn’t bite.
Scaling back just rubs me the wrong way.
Listen, we're all fish out of water now.
I was told this is a dive bar.
Seriously, I’m think about going back to school.
Please, don’t start with the “there are other fish in the sea” speech...
You don't have a fishbowl? How about a fish platter, then?" (By Beatriz Whitford, age 7, Chicago IL
I invited Sandra out - but she’s a little koi
It was her fishnet stockings that hooked me...
One more for the stream
I'm waiting for my friend, Gefilte. The Putz is always late!
Water!  Make it a double!  And keep 'em coming!
I'm a fish out of bourbon.
No sir, I'll know I've hit bottom when I see the flounder.
My mortgage is underwater.
I'll have one more for the river.
I hate facing the parents at "back to school" night.
Thank you, I'm flattered. But you need to know that my husband is  a plastic sturgeon.
Yeah, and I smoke like a chimney, too.
I always feel safer in a vegan bar.
Got any 12 year old Hudson River back there?
I drink like a fish? Oh, that's hilarious. I've never heard that one before.
Well, I am a fish so yes I drink like one.
Hey Bartender, I'm outta 
water here.
You don't happen to have some of those cute little Goldfish Crackers do you?
Of course I drink like a fish! What else would I drink like?!
To the gills, Manny. To the gills.
Think about it - why call it Earth and not Planet Ocean?
... so then that she called me a bottom feeder and spawned with some bass player!
This is who I am. I don't play koi.
You know, where I'm from, the drinks are free.
Fish? We prefer "Underwater Americans".
We only serve fish of Fridays
Is this my dream or is it yours, Phil. If it's mine, give me another gin and tonic.
Betas can be alphas too, chum!
My first choice was “screw like a rabbit,” next was “eat like a pig,” but they gave me this simile.
Do you know a fish called Wanda?
I'll have one for the roe.
No, I'm not a fish out of water, I'm a fish out of Scotch - fill em all up please!
No!  My name’s not Wanda.
It's not easy being orange these days!
What? You said a fin would cover it!
I'm here to feed the stereotype.
Who invites a fish to a dry wedding?
And I'm sick of those "Roe vs. Wade" jokes!
So, a fish walks into a bar and says to the barkeep: 'Have I got a tale for you'.
I'll  have a Grasshopper, please.
Funny, where I come from, they say I drink like an Wall Street trader.
“Turns out I do need a bicycle after all.”
Thanks for letting me off the hook tonight.
The key, Bill, is everything in moderation. Don't get hooked.
Water. With a splash of scotch.
I'm meeting a mermaid for drinks.
Which part of  "wet Martini" do you not understand?
Look, I’ve heard every “drinks like a fish joke”, OK
There’s plenty of fish to in the sea, she says. And that’s when it hits me: Hey, this ain’t just a saying.
And I fell for her lies, hook, line, and sinker"
You’re from Martha’s Vineyard, Louie?  Me too, I went to school there.
Did I ever tell you about the one I got away from?
OK, I'll take the bait, who DO I remind you of?
Lou, would I lie to you? I'm fine to dive home tonight.
Do I judge you? I do not.
So a perch, a minnow, and a rabbitfish go into a bar...
A rabbi and a priest suggested I come in here.
Yeah and you breathe like a mammal!
I used to be a small fish in a big pond, but now. . .
Listen, Larry, you try growing up a giant, anthropomorphized carp and see if you don’t toss back a few too many from time to time.
So I'm talking out of school - so what?
Oh, YOU don't like it when people knock on the table to get your attention?!?
Yeah? Well there's a good reason why I carp about everything!
Let me tell ya about being a big fish in a small pond.
Don’t gimme “there’s plenty of fish in the sea” nonsense.
I don't drink like a fish; but my father, there was a fish who could drink.
Yes, I know I'm a cliché.
You're baiting me.
My doctor said to stay hydrated.
What’s the drink that comes with a worm?
And another thing...don't call me "chum" anymore.
They're always asking,"where's Nemo",never "how's Nemo."
Oh yeah? Well you serve like a bartender!
Tell the ladies I'm the catch of the day.
I got here on my bicycle."
Actually, learning to sit on a bar stool was harder than learning to drink from a glass.
How many more shots is it going to take to get to that worm?
And then I'm going to need you to pour it over my gills.
Drowning my sorrows just isn't working for me
I’m telling you- she was the one that got away.
Pick my poisson.
...and you drink like a bald guy with a moustache!
Do you have any of those gold fish crackers?
Give Me one for my baby and one more for the roe
If it's got a worm, I'll drink it!
Hook me up.
I am not making this up. He was the biggest guy I ever caught. At least 14 feet tall.
People tell me I'm quite a catch.
Ain't no bigger fish to fry than me, pal.
Fish out of water?  No, I’m a fish out of bourbon. Now pour me another!
If my wife calls, I’m not here. She doesn’t like my getting tanked.
Sometimes I really do feel that I need a bicycle.
So, first off, how am I supposed to ‘walk’ into a bar?
Ten billion years of evolution and I still can’t frickin’ walk!
I'm very old school.
Say it and you Die.
It was the worm that caught my attention at first, but now I'm hooked on tequila.
Sheesh, not all mackerels are holy.
This stuff goes right through me.
I'm not eating tonight, afraid of getting caught.
I'm outta water.
I’m telling you, the hook was this big.
I’d like one for my baby, and one more for the roe.
She got the castle in the divorce
I just wanna get tanked.
Yeah, I’m the one that got away!
I'm going to need a bigger glass.
Is it red or white that goes with fish?
So Aquaman gets top billing and a cut of the gross. Me? Union minimum.
Hey, I would be home now if I wanted to drown my sorrows!
I am the story
I thought this was a wet bar!
So I told the genie I'd make one more wish just for the "hell of it", but he heard "halibut".
Actually Mario, I feel like carp.
You do realize it’s physically impossible to drown my sorrows.
Well what did you expect? Of course I drink like a fish.
I'm telling you, the fisherman was only this tall. Maybe seven inches, tops. Craziest thing I've ever seen.
What?! This isn't a wet bar?
...and make it dry this time
I'll just have my usual, sex on the beach.
That's drink AS a fish.
Where did you think the expression "Drinks like a fish" came from?
That’s highly offensive.  How would you like it if I said you drink like a human?
Back in the day, a fish could get a drink in this place without the third degree.
And no, I did not sleep with Luca Brasi.
...so she says, You never take me anywhere...we just swim around in circles and  I'm like, Circles? - it's a square glass pool....and she's like....
You try watching all your friends get flushed and see how you cope.
Would you happen to have a spare bathtub I could crash in?
No.  Sagittarius.
Tequila summer cocktail, please.  Leave the worm.
So then Kafka said to me ...
So he trolled me for a week thinking I was a grouper!
Yeah I  know.And I look like one too!
I”ll have a tequila and put the worm on a hook”
Looks like a fish, swims like a fish, drinks like a fish....buddy I must be a fish!
Say, you wouldn't know where I could find someone to hook up with?
Just give me anything with a couple of sardines in it.
Salt the rim.
Well, I like coming here because you DO water down the drinks.
Hey, mouth breather, how 'bout another round?
No, we met IN the net, and it was NOT a hook-up.
Don't tell me I've had enough. You're the guy talking to a fish!
Just one. I'm drying out.
I only drink for the oxygen.
There were too many fish in the sea...
You try paying for a private school.
No plastic straws
No, I won't stop carping about the environment.  It's who I am.
Two more shots, then I'll tell you about the time I met Moby Dick.
Listen, pal, I can always tell when someone's watering down my drinks!
The hook-up culture really doesn’t work for me.
Aquarius. You?
Listen pal, if you're not at the bar you're on the menu.
Yeah? Well you bartend like a human!
Being out of water is nothing.  Why are YOU out of scotch?!
Float like a butterfly, drink like a fish.
Give me one for my baby, and one for the roe.
And leave the bottle.  I just got out of the tank.
Me? Just another koi meets girl, koi loses girl story.
Don't worry, pal, I'll just swim home.
I need a bicycle.
Are you serving the little goldfish snacks?
A Jesus fish, Gefilte fish, and Angelfish walk into a sand bar...
The truth is, I'm kind of afraid of drying out.
Make it a double. I've been totally underwater at work.
Of course I drink like a fish.
When my wife told me there were a lot more fish in the pond I knew it was over.
Sometimes I just feel like a fish out of water.
I don’t know, sometimes I just feel like a fish out of water.
Look, sir, I've been way more tanked than this!
I know what you're thinking and I already resent it.
Do I want a straw!? Are you trying to kill me!?
You shoulda seen the size of that fisherman!
Shark Week, Shark Week, Shark Week - what about Goldfish Week?
If I drank like a fish, do you think I'd be hanging out in this dive?
What do you mean you don't get it? The lobster was a ventriloquist.
My wife just left me and my business is underwater.
Yeah? Well, you drink like a little bald man.
No, I don't drink water! Fish have sex in it.
And I'll know if it's watered down.
In retrospect, I should NOT have taken the kids to see the sharks.
I need water, lots of it, and a taxi to the river.
So my problem is, I can hold my liquor, I just can't hold my water.
I'm a fish, what kind of handshake did you expect.
…..no, I didn’t get the job.  The guy said I had a weak handshake.”
I, too, was once peed on by a Russian.
Your sign lured me in.
...and don’t  water it down....
So, what if I am sloshed to the gills?
I’ll tell YOU when I’m loaded to the gills, friend.
What?  You thought it was just an expression?
I also throw like a girl
Gills just wanna have fun
I just dare you to say it!  I dare you!
Bartender, call me a crab.
I'm a cliché? That's rich coming from the mustached dive bartender doling out life advice to his lone customer.
"Let 'em try to drain the swamp!
I am not fishing for a compliment.  I just want a drink.
I can’t believe it, Jimmy. She left me for a Betta male.
What’s your best water?
So a catfish, a bass and a shark walk into a bar...
If you see him, tell him the one that got away is looking for him.
Do you have something that goes well with fish?
It's sink or swim out there.
They sent me a dead mobster wrapped in newspaper, like that's gonna scare me or somethin'.
ANOTHER ONE because 'carp diem!,' and all that.
People say I drink like a fish but they never consider that I identify as a horse!
Cut off?! I've been drinking like a fish since before you could swim.
Heavy on the water.
You’re gonna love this one...A swordfish, a catfish, and a jellyfish walk into a bar...
Luca Brasi says hello.
Sigh. All my life, I have been a fish out of water.
The funny thing about drinking like a fish is that you can't ever drown your sorrows.
She said she just couldn’t see herself with someone who tested positive for PCBs.
Look, pal, are you going to help me drown my troubles or not?
You'd drink like me too if you had 1,000 kids.
Don't mess with me. I just got out of the tank.
I took one nap and my whole life was flushed down the toilet.
I'm not out of water. I'm out of gin!
OK, just one more quick one before they start missing me at the bowl.
Nobody is cutting me off until I get to that worm!
Do you have Absolute Worm?
So I drink like a fish. You got a problem with that?
Are you trying to tell me I'm washed up?
I know I'm a good catch but lately a lot of creepy looking men keep trying to reel me in.
I smoke like a chimney too!
I can do anything.  Sometimes I just grab em by the gills.
You should have seen the action I was getting when 'The Shape of Water' was out.
What do you mean it's time for me to 'dry out'?
I'm just looking for a hook up tonight
I don't care that his name is Amirror, he's been staring at me all night and I'm just drunk enough to say something.
No my name is not Wanda.  I guess all fish look alike to you guys.
Six more bourbon and waters, hold the bourbon.
Are you telling me I can't drown my sorrows here?
How else do you think a herring gets pickled?
If you won't let me drive home can I at least borrow your bicycle?
But if you teach a man how to be a fish, he can drink all day long every day.
Listen buddy, I'm not hooked on anything
And don't water it down this time!
And at these prices, you won't get many more.
So I said to the cop, "How could I possibly be texting and driving? I got no thumbs."
So then she goes, you look nothing like your profile and calls me a catfish.
I'll have another water on the rocks, please, extra salt.
Yes, I drink like a fish, but I'm not getting hooked!
Then she tells me - there's plenty of you in the sea.
Go ahead, say it. I drink like a what? Go on, say it to my gills.
Look bud, I'd say my problem right now is I'm a fish outta whiskey
Oh, yeah? I bet you smoke like a chimney, baldy.
So you're a Pisces too!
Another mescal and don't forget the worm this time!
Listen buddy, I had the orange complexion down a long time ago - but you don’t see me up at the crack of dawn to tweet about it.
Ever since he drained the swamp, I've felt like a fish out of water."
Actually,  I drink like an alcoholic. Now keep 'em comin'.
Call me a cab, I shouldn't dive,"
They say I slept with Luca Brasi.
You should have seen the guy I caught today.
Look, I'm a herring, dammit...and if I want to get pickled, I'm going to get pickled!
I drink like a fish therefore I am a fish!
I'm hoping to meet someone who likes to throw 'em back
In fifty years, this whole city will be under water — and I'll be where you are, refusing YOU your seventh tequila!
Fish like a drink!
Why do I drink?  Do you know what it's like to feel like a fish out of water?
I'm hooked on this place. Your live streaming lured me in.
My problems started when I dropped out of school.
'...because I'm THIRSTY! Why the hell do YOU drink so much?
Please. Not another Daryl Hannah story.
Yes, I am a fish out of water!
Make it quick, I don't have a lot of time.
Fin and tonic, please.
I've only been out of school a week and already I'm hooked!
I used to be like a fish out of the water and now I just drink like a fish
No, really...I’m the one that got away.
The priest and the rabbi couldn't make it.
...and boom, the next day the sunken treasure is missing, Lulu’s floating upside-down over the bubbler, and I’ve got 500 babies to support and a case of ick like the world’s never seen. So don’t tell me I’ve had enough.
No, I don't like the Dolphins on Sunday. I think they're too smart for their own good.
I'm funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown fish?
Forget the tequila, just bring me the worm!
You know what really pisses me off?  When I hear someone say that he feels like a  ‘fish out of  water’.   Like he could have even the tiniest clue what that feels like!
We're gonna need a bigger glass.
. . .  my wife's sleeping with Jimmy Hoffa.
I’m between ponds right now.
Yeah, I swam with sharks once. It started me drinking"
This has always been my favorite watering hole.
Yes, and I eat like a bird. Got a problem with that?
Maybe I drink like an alcoholic, Karl? Has it every crossed your mind to say that, Karl? Has it?!
It’s the only way to keep my mercury levels down.
It's Piscean, not "pissing."
I'll say when I'm sloshed.
I know. A fish swims into a concrete wall. Dam.
So I drink like a fish.  What's your point?
I am aware of the irony, but I would like a dry martini.
Don't sweat it. I have a designated swimmer outside.
We were all line caught in my day, none of this farming nonsense.
I'm telling you, it was a think tank.
You really don't need to tell me what I drink like.
Oh cry me a river!
They're my gills and if I want to get stewed to them I will!
Don’t judge me unti you’ve swam in the East River.
Whadd'ya mean, you're outa water?  I'm the one that's outa water.
I just wish they'd be more specific. I drink like a carp.
Keep ‘em coming. I’m getting stewed to the gills tonight.
So I says to the fishmonger- hey buddy, you want a piece of me?
Then he said "Gail, you drink like a fish!" So I ate the bastard.
I may be a fish out of water, but I know my scotch!
AS a fish. Drinking AS a fish, not LIKE one.
I'm the only one who graduated.
... then she got pregnant and I had to drop out of school...
You better hope these drinks are watered down.
There's nothing worse than feeling like a fish out of vodka.
So then she says to me, 'A real man would have made it upstream.'
Correction:  There WERE a lot of fish in the Sea.
My old lady's been crabby all day.
So I told her "I date only wild caught."
I'm home sick. Do you have anything  that has the faint taste of Oil, with a slight background of Pesticides and  Plastic on the rocks?
You know, 'Thank God it's Friday' is a saying I never use.
I don’t live to drink, I drink to live.
A dive bar’s a dive bar, Fred. Just pour the shots.
Don’t tell me when I need to scale back.
Yeah, she’s at her mother’s place in the East River. I told her I’d be home by fall.
Why yes, that's exactly how I drink!  What did you expect?
I'm trying to cut back.  I drink like a fish.
And another thing, I'm sick of people calling things fishy...
She left me for a flounder.  Can you believe it? A flounder!
So, I said to him, "No, you go jump in the lake."
I'll decide when I'm tanked.
Shot of tequila, please.  Extra worm.
Hey! I’m outta water!
Ya. Ya. "Drink like a fish". I get it. Do I make fun of your nose?
I fell for her hook, line, and sinker...and then I caught her spawning with someone else.
...believe you me- having that guy in the White House doesn't work for me either.
So, how'd a guy like you end up working in an underwater bar?
Tonight I want to drink like a man.
One more and I'm calling my designated diver.
Gimme four more: I want to get tanked tonight.
It really should be 'drink AS a fish'
No! really, so a fish walks into a bar...
Ever since I moved to this city I feel just like a fish out of water.
Of course I want another, I’ve got a reputation to keep.
Listen, pal - I know every dive around.
Let me guess - one of those koi meets girl, koi loses girl stories?
Of course I'm thirsty. I'm a fish out of water.
Another one for the halibut.
Don't tell me what I drink like.
Just water, please. and make it a double.
As you can see, I do.
There's a reason it's a cliche.
That's because I AM a fish.
Yeah, well, you tend bar like a bartender.
Aw, c'mon - just one more for the river....
Of course I want the worm in my tequila!
I'm starting to think my sorrows can't be drowned.
Another Tequila ...and this time don't forget the worm!
What do you mean I don't have a leg to stand on!
so you're telling me that these so called "chefs", cut up my friends and place them on top of sticky rice?
And then she said,"You're not the only fish in the sea."
I'll have have 50 galllons of water with a twist of lemon.
That's right, I'm the one that got away.
Well, at these prices,you won't get many more.
You got any of those little crackers...oh...what are they called?
I've been hooked on worse things.
Give me my keys back! I swear I'm not driving!
Do I want a splash of water in my drink? What's water?
Listen! I don't care who you think I am, the name is Wanda!

No alcohol, I don't want to get pickled.
I tell you that man I caught was this short if he wasn't even shorter!
Have I got a story for you...
Whaddya' mean, "you don't serve fish here"?
Drink, drink, drink...And I'm underwater on my home.
I'm not like the other fishes
She fell for me the moment she saw me - hook, line and sinker
Since she left I feel like a fish out of water
Just a splash, please.
I’ll have another. I feel dehydrated.
Haven't you heard of pickled Herring?
She hooks every boyfriend by fixing him a Grasshopper to drink, but I didn't take the bait. Most guys fall for it hook, line, and sinker.
Why don't you put up the GONE FISHIN' sign, and we'll takle it from there?
And for my third wish I said I wanted to be able drink like a fish without falling on my butt. So presto, no butt.
Actually, I drink in moderation.
I find your use of the phrase "drinks like a fish" to be both specist and demeaning.
I thought I would take a gap year and see the world before I spawn.
Who wouldn't drink like a fish these days?
Keep  the Perrier coming. I feel like a real fish out of water tonight!
You look like you've never seen a fish out of water.
CWater, straight up, room temperature, in a five gallon tank, 
as soon as possible
Of course I’m cold-blooded,” I tell her
You got anything back there that'll wash down this fishy taste?
Actually, it’s an idiom. The word “like” doesn’t automatically make it a simile.
Just one more-I had a bad day in school.
I'm just trolling for a hook-up.
No, I swear- this is not a Fish Story.
She said she needed me like she needed a bicycle.
May I have a glass of water please? - a very large glass of water.
You’re out of water? No, I’m out of water.
I'm meeting Michael Avenatti to discuss my deposition.
OK - I'll try an Evian.
I won't let you off the hook if you call me chum again.
A little dry for my taste.
Hey, I'll drink the way nature intended, ok?
I'm meeting a guy here; he said that he can hook me up.
At least I won’t drown in my sorrows
I first got hooked when I was a minnow.
The swim-up bar was too crowded.
Give me a river on the rocks.
I’m not getting green around the gills- that’s just algae.
Thanks for drink.  Will a fin take care of it?
I'll have what the fish in the back aquarium are having.
Apparently, I drink like a human.
We’ve adapted.
I'm a Pisces.  What are you, a Leo?
My bicycle left me and life’s just not the same.
I’ll have a Tuna Surprise, and no wise cracks.
Don't be Koi with me.
I’m having a bit of trouble breathing. May I have a glass of water?
She left me for a carp. Can you believe it? A CARP!
Hear anything more about this spawn and die thing?
...sigh,  I used to be a GREAT catch!
I'm fine to swim home."
Can you call me an Uber Pool?
I don't like the atmosphere.
Do you think I look fat in this dress?
spare the sarcasm and keep the tab going
One day you're a protected species, the next day they're blaming wildfires on you.
I carp about everything.
Some guys just think they're into mermaids...because they have never had a whole fish.
Stop watering down my drinks.
spare me the "to the gills" jokes and pour me another shot...
You ever seen the "Shape of Water"?
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't drink like a fish.
Listen, a fish out of water sometimes needs a drink, OK?
Some days I feel like a fish out of water.
I'd like a bowl of water
Water, no ice and make it salty
Let's just get this out of the way.

No, I don't work for scale. Yes, I drink like a fish. No, I don't have a "fin" I can lend you. I want a gill of the scotch and some caviar with oyster crackers... and keep 'em coming.
Listen Clyde, I don't need a man or a bicycle.
But enough about me. Whats your story?
You know something? You really are the best bartender in this bowl.
Tequila, with extra worms... and hold the tequila.
OK, I drink like a fish. What about it?"
When they flushed me down the bowl I knew I had to strike out on my own!
Yes, thanks, I HAVE heard I drink like a fish.
I don’t think I can drive, can you point me to nearest toilet?
I used to drink like a man.
‘Plenty of Fish’ my foot! Maybe I’ll try Tinder.
You do realize this is not a costume?
Have you read “Being Russian” by D.J. Trump”?
Aqua, vîte
Oh yeah?! And you steal like a bartender!
Every time someone says 'You drink like a fish' I take a shot.
So we're flirting and I tell her 'Don't be coy!', but she kinda took it the wrong way.
Scotch and salt water, please.
So then I says ‘you better watch out or you’ll be swimmin’ with the people’
You have no idea what it's like to be a fish out of water.
Forget the tequila just give me the worm.
I swear to God, if you say the words "belly up"...
And before you ask, no, I don't want it watered down
You're fired he says. You've become too big for this pond.
No, this isn’t just another fish story.
I've been swimmin' upstream all my life.
No, tell me, what DOES a fish drink like?
A vodka martini, dry. But, you know, not too dry.
Yeah, well you probably drink like a human.
What do you mean you served me three seconds ago?
I'm a saltwater fish in a freshwater world.
On the rocks, like my eggs.
Stop me if you've heard this one. A horse walks into a bar...
OK. Can I have one for the ocean?
No, I don't want it dry.
Never underestimate the power of a simile.
You're looking at me like no one's ordered a Shirley Temple before.
Drink like a fish? 6 shots is nothing!
Not meeting anyone. Just here for the halibut.
Has anyone ever said you look just like the dude in "Gandhi"
I thought she was playing coy, but turned out she was just koi.
Anything but water--I'm so sick of it.
Turns out she was a catfish.
CAN YOU MAKE AN EXTRA WET MARTINI
No salt this time, Johnny. Makes me too homesick.
Make that with extra salt, please.
Every time a bell rings, an angelfish gets its wings.
A tequilla, straight up, double worms.
If  you want to swim with the fishes, you have to drink like a fish.
I'm a human, what have YOU been drinking?
So there’s no Flappy Hour?
I know I'm on the hook for this, but it's his ass that's on the line!
Not thanks. I'm tanked.
Of all the fin joints in town, she has to swim into this one.
Whaddaya mean there's something fishy about my story?
Got anything with more oxygen?
Has Jonah been here lately?
And there I was, like a fish out of vodka.
Give me a shot of pond water, and leave the bowl.
You’re out of water?
I drink because I look like a penis with fins
Why, yes, I do drink a little too much....why do you ask?
And then I tell her, "A bigger pond gots nothing that we don't have right here!"
Listen, I constantly drink my own filth. Don't tell me what I can and can't handle.
Another splash please.
No, you can't have a fin!
Luca Brasi?  Yeah, maybe I’ ve seen him.  Who wants to know?
Listen, pal. “It’ll cost you a fin” really gets old after a while.
Yeah,​ I drink like a Fish, you got a problem with that?
Yeah, I'm a Siamese fighting fish. You wanna make something of it?
Never tell a Genie that “you feel like a fish out of water!”
I dried out at rehab
Yeah?   Your mother breaths like a human!
Sand bars are totally overrated
No, no, I'll BE the pickled herring!
I'm toasting the day I swam out of the Flint River.
The evolution train left without me
Well, I once had a drink that was THIS big.
Water. Hold the scotch.
Thank Cod -- you are such a good listener!!!
And one more for the stream...
What do you have that goes with Tilapia?
This is the only place where I'm not made to feel like a fish out of water.
Bartender, I'll have a tequila with extra worms.
I know, I know.  You don't get many big fish in here.
When I say a splash, I mean a big splash.
Not one word!
Listen pal, I decide when I need water.
What's the matter...never seen anyone drink like a fish?
A pint please and one for the river
Hey! You don't know the things I've seen. I was on that basement wall for 20 years. Pour Billy another!
I don't need you to tell me to scale back!
No, I don't want that martini dry.
I don't tell you how to breathe, you don't tell me how to drink.
She was just a little carp! I turned her into a koi!  I found us a perfect pond! It had lily pads! Lots of them! It had a porcelain castle fountain, for pity's sake! It had beautiful algae. We were happy! ..until she ran off with a guppy!! A GUPPY!!
I just can't have another drink. I'm stuffed to the gills.
What did you *think* I was gonna drink like?
Hey, you're Tony Levin! I love your work with King Crimson! You're the reason I learned to play "bass!" . . . Get it?? "Bass," like the fish, and like the instrument? . . . Yeah, I know they're pronounced differently . . . Oh, just gimme a damn beer.
Do you have any idea how hard it is living up to an idiom?
They don’t tell you how hard it is outside of the tank.
Do you have any of those little cheesy goldfish to munch on?
And then I said, I'm just trying to be koi.
What are you saying...How’s a fish SUPPOSED to drink?
And the next guy I got away from was even bigger!
I've swallowed toxic radiation. What's a beer gonna do to me?
The last bartender who alluded to my drinking like a fish is currently "swimming with the fishes".
One mezcal, neat....Don’t forget the worm.
Oh ya? Well you eat like a horse.
Hey buddy I swam upstream all day and can have as many drinks as I want!
It's like I always say, give a fish a drink and he'll be drunk for a day. But, teach a fish to drink. . .
Can you recommend a marine biologist in this neighborhood?
I remember when this place used to be an ocean.
Yes, I'm doing swimmingly. And, no, I don't drink like a fish. So quit carping and give me a Cutty with a splash.
I met her on line, but recently she keeps asking me for a picture.
Hey… just because I am drunk, doesn’t mean I am gonna take the bait, pal”
Unfortunately, I'm only attracted to barracudas.
This is six, I ordered Seven Seas.
Let me tell you one more thing. I’m tired of swimming upstream.
No I am not admiral ackbar
Trust me when I tell you that the last shot tasted ‘watered’.”
Yeah, I am that fish...
You, sir, have no idea how much a fish can drink.
I feel so cheap becoming a Field & Stream centerfold.
I can’t keep myself afloat ever since the stock market crashed.
...not everybody who comes in here can drown their sorrows, capiche?
So a shark, a minnow and a clown fish walk into a bar...
I'll take it straight. I'm trying to cut back on water.
Glad to see you're a cool guy. In most bars I get the fisheye.
I'd be considered a good catch in most fishing holes.
Turns out all those other fish in the sea were also sleeping with Karen.
Saltwater, neat.
Personally, I find the saying more aspirational.
You should have seen the guy that almost caught me!
They say I drink like a you-know-what"
There ain't nothin' more powerful than the odor of mendacity.
Got any human crackers?
Only the President spells FISH with a P!
Saltwater.  Make it a double.
I don't like my drinks on the rocks for obvious reasons.
Why does everyone think I'm a Pisces?
So I told her, I've had it with your constant mocking of my mouth movements!
Yeah, well you serve like a mammal!
I got tired of the meat market.
You can't cut me off just because I drink like a fish.
Screw you! You wouldn't be saying I drink a lot if I weren't Irish."
Yes!  I want the one with the worm!
-----SO THIS FISH SWIMS INTO A BAR-------
As a matter of fact, there is an Uber for fish...it's called Scuber.
Actually, it didn't take me too long to get hooked.
I could use a wet one....
Did I tell you about the one that got away?  I fell for her hook, line, and sinker.
I drink like one too.
Drinks like a fish, that's all I ever hear. I know it's a metaphor but let me tell you, metaphors can hurt.
Okay buddy, you wanna take this downstream?
what wine goes well with fish?
Just seltzer. I'm drying out.
A piranha, a rabbitfish and a mackerel walk in to a bar . . .
So, I'm reeling in this average sized child,when out of nowhere this huge Samoan—at least 6'6", 280 pushing 290—comes out of nowhere and just rips him off the line!
No, I'm not a fish out of water. I'm a fish out of Scotch and soda. Pour me another.
So, when you say I smell like your first wife, that's not a compliment, is it.
Yes, salt water is good. But so is dark rum.
Sorry, I know you told me 3 seconds ago but what was your name again?
Don't give me that carp."
I'm gonna need a bigger glass.
I’ll have 80 gallons of water in a very large glass.
A shot of tequila, and please include the worm
Well, you stare like a human.
Take my advice, don't ever fall in love with a mackerel.
With more rapid sea level rise, I wanted to be sure to get a good seat.
So a tuna, a marlin, and a sailfish walk into this bar, see.
A glass of your purest, plastic-free deep-sea water. Make it double.
I'd like a very,very wet martini.
Of Course I drink like a fish, always have.
Stewed to the gills?
So I told him we are done for good. I need that guy like I need a bicycle.
My shrink says it's because I can't commit.
And that's when I realized that all the ponds in all the towns were going to be small and the problems of one oversized carp don't amount to a pile of roe in this crazy world.
Just water for now, please.
C'mon -- just one more for the stream.
how about one more for the Roe?
A priest, a lawyer, and a doctor walk into a bar....
What do you mean, 'I must be looking to get tanked?'
Martini, please. Extremely wet."
Of course I know it's your well scotch... I'm a bottom feeder.
Now, you know where the expression, "drink like a fish", comes from, my friend.
Don't get me started on the pescatarians.
I’ve been told I drink like a fish, so I’m trying to scale it back.
No more fake castles and caves. This, _this_ is an aquarium ornament.
So, is this the only watehole in town?
I’ll have a Catch and Release with a twist of kelp.
You'll never believe it, I got this great man story..
Another freshwater! Can’t get it back home.
Yes, and I'm going to drink like one too.
Well, at $35 for a beer I expect you won’t see many fish at the bar.
Doesn’t matter. As long as no fish ever peed in it.
So, a horse walks into a bar and says, "Do you serve fish here?"
So I said, "listen buddy, nobody calls ME a Haddock."
Eighteen bucks for a martini?! ... and they call me cold-blooded."
Yeah, I drink and I'm a fish, got a problem?
So I say to her,"Don't get coy with me."
I don’t like to drink out of school...
Yeah- the divorce is almost final. She caught me and released me.
With a twist of kelp, please
And when I outgrew the tank, I moved here to the city.
Well, you pour like a sloth.
...Hold the mescal, just give me the worm.
You know what Kyle? Thanks to BP there actually aren't 'plenty of fish in the sea' okay?
Yours is Ben Kingsley?  Mine is a toss-up between Wanda and Flipper.
I said, ‘no more!’ - and jumped right out of the bowl.
You're out of well vodka? That seems...what's the word...
I'm telling ya'....the scales of justice weren't in my favor!
I want to get drunk to the gills.
I don't care how many I've had...Keep pouring that Tequila until I get the worm!!
A fish came into a bar...............
Sorry, these scales don't tip.
You'd think winning an Academy Award would help make things easier.
How much to just pour it in my gills?
Luca Brasi sent me.
I shoulda known, she was only in it for the sushi
School? You're kidding. What do you call a bunch of eels?
I hear you water down your drinks.
Not so, sir!  I say, "One man's carp is another man's poisson."
Water with a splash of salt.
...but do I LOOK like a fish out of water?
Make it double.  I’m feeling like a fish out of water.
A big glass please!!
Any other ideas? Drowning my sorrows never seems to work for me.
Give me one for the tributary.
Make it a double-- I 'm skipping school today'
Ask “on the rocks?” one more time, buddy—one more time!
I give up, I'm done—Nemo can find his own way home.
Let me worry about whether I have had enough.  Where do you think the saying "he can drink like a fish" came from?
How can you be surprised that I drink like a fish?
Just water, please.  They say I drink like a fish.
No. On the rocks is where I came from; it ain't where I'm goin'...
No, I don't want water. I pee in there!
......so I told Mr Attenborough straight up:  "Look Richard, if you expect me to agree to being filmed swallowing a plastic bag in the name of saving the planet, I don't fall for that trick and I don't want a part in your lousy show.....
Did you get a load of her attitude? So what, I switched out my eHarmony photo. Everyone’s doing that!
YOU'RE out of water? I'M out of water!
Hey, I can tell you about the one who almost caught me.
And she took the eggs.
I'll have a seaweed martini with anchovie olives and don't  overcharge me like you tried with the gorilla.
Wait, you’re out of water?
Make the next one with a splash.
Do you have any idea how difficult a 12-step program is for me?
I know how I drink. just keep 'em coming.
Goldschlager? Fine. Goldfish? Not so much.
She hooked up with a fisherman and left me with the guppies.
Scotch and water, bourbon and water, water and water,  whatever.  Just make it quick!
I know you been watering down those high balls.  I KNOW WATER when I taste it...
Stop me if this sounds like a fish tale.
One margarita, extra salt.
...And if I didn't have Jesus in my life i might still be a loaf.
I'm not hooked, I can quit anytime I want to.
I'll have a bottle of tequila, hold the tequila.
Don't judge me. Have you *seen* the new EPA regulations?"
Don't worry, I'm taking Uber pool back to the pond.
Scotch and lots of water.
Yes, dogfish beer but sushi doesn't agree with me.
I know you want to say it, but I know my limits.
One more jibe about me drinking like a fish and you'll be swimming with 'em!
Yeah...They all say that, but I think of myself as someone who eats like a bird.
I think I might know better than anyone if there were something fishy going on here!
I'm just here to prove a point.
.....and then she said I drink like a fish.
Water, and lots of it
Hold it right there Mister, I am not stewed to the gills
If my next tequila doesn't have a worm, I 'll never drink here again!
I am sorry Mr.Herring. I can’t serve you another, you are already pickled.
The swamp isn't what it used to be.
If there was plenty more, I wouldn't be here.
Yeah, more water--filtered water. There's no going back to that natural stuff.
So thats how I was the one who got away.
Make it wet.
...I know, I know, but get this!  The guy actually fell for it--hook, line, and sinker!
When I drink like a fish, I feel like I am a mermaid
Buddy, I AM dried out.
My life is going down the toilet.
I drink like a fish.  What'd you expect?
Let me have another Jim Bream, please.
Well yes, I suppose I do drink like a fish. What’s your point?
Keep the tequila coming - I want that worm!!!
Fish tank, drunk tank--what's the difference? Hit me again.
On second thought, just gimme a glass of water. Make it a double.
I'm not being coy with you.
C'mon, none of your other customers drink like me.
Very funny. And you drink like a human.
I'M SORRY, but gold is a color.  We prefer the term Koi as a group, but specifically, I prefer Kohaku.
Since the election I've been drinking like a fish.
What do you mean my story sounds a little fishy?
Yea, so I drink like a fish. What's your point?
I'll have a shot of scotch and 10,000 gallon glass of water.
I don’t wanna go home to my fishwife.
Listen, we’ve got to stop this Catch and Release program!
Make me one with no plastic
And now that guy is on hanging on my aquarium wall.
Well, perhaps just a small one. I don't want to tip the scales
Not on the rocks. Reminds to much of how Aunt Bettie passed.
Who are you calling a fish out of water?
This fish is out of whiskey.
If one more guy tries to pick me up with the line "You have a nice bass" I'll sucker punch him!
Look, buddy, when I said I wanted to swim in cognac, I MEANT it.
Who are you calling a fish out of water?
...so she started saying things like 'suspicious', 'dubious', 'odd', but I knew what she was really getting at, she just didn't want to say it to my face...
It's real simple. Just some tap water and 6-8 drops of dechlorinator.
‘You’re drinkin’ like a fish.’ Seriously, Dude, that’s the best you got?
So to get back at the bastard, I peed in his pool.
One more just to keep my head above water.
You're probably sick of my carping about draining the swamp- but pour another-
Buddy, for me she IS the only fish in the sea.
...but then she got away !
Make sure you get your story straight - I didn't "walk" in here
...so I said to him ‘do your worst, Kafka!’
Do you know how hard it is to come up with names for 1000 kids?
You got any of dem brightly-colored pebbles?
How was I to know she's still in school.
....and then she swam into my life....
Then she dumped me, said I had no sole.
You don't understand what it is like down there, with the sharks!
I'm looking for the Rabbi and the Priest.
Yeah, so what if this is my sixth?  In case you haven't noticed I'm a fish.
So a guy swims into a bar, see...
You bartenders are all the same. Don't give me that plenty of fish       in the sea crap.
It all started when I dropped out of the school...
I'll have a gimlet, a Manhattan, a grasshopper, a blue lagoon, a sidecar, three drafts of Bud Lite, a Bartles and Jaymes Fuzzy Navel, a Cutty Sark, neat, and no similes.
It's a common misconception. We don't actually drink water.
Pickled herring, yeah, yeah, very funny
Every role I audition for goes to a human or a robot.
It got personal when he said he had bigger fish to fry.
I guess my biggest problem is that I always play too koi.
And you would not believe the amount of plastic I have to put up with!
Stop telling me: "There are plenty of fish in the sea." Sharon was one of a kind.
Dry martini
What do you mean, ‘out  of water’.
Not many people know this, but it was I who bit Ahab’s leg
Oh I think I CAN hold my water... give me another...
You're gonna charge me for water?
You're piscine in the wind buddy
That is amazing, how did you know my name was Wanda?
That joke is old and patronizing. This fish walked into a bar because he just lost his job and has to go home to tell the wife and spawn
Can you believe that my wife said I drank like a fish and threw me out?
Stewed?  Perhaps, but not to the gills.  So keep pouring, pal.
Stop Carping about Trump !
My school ID is too valid.
That’s enough for me—I’m swimming tonight.
I don't usually drink like this, but the atmosphere is suffocating.
Never fall in love with a hooker, she'll leave you high and dry.
Yeah? Well, you swim like a person.
No, I want it very DRY.  And by the way, that's racist.
Hey enough of the Mr. Lipid jokes! Pour me a stiff one.
Of course fish get thirsty and I want the next one with a splash of saltwater.
My lady kicked me out, she said, “you drink like a fish.”  I mean, I AM  A FISH!
Don't bother offering. The last time I tried to "swallow the worm," I wound up with a hook in my mouth.
Why the fish-face?
This one definitely has the fine bouquet of Lake Michigan.
Duh. And you suck air like a mammal, pal.
You calling me a chicken?!
And that’s how I joined the Yakuza
Nobody knows...the bubbles I've seen.
OK, let's knock off the fish-walks-into-a-bar nonsense. Just get me a triple Stoli and a tub of salt water, quick.
Whaddaya mean you don't serve fish? Can't you see I'm a whitefish
Why am I a fluke?
Here’s another one. A fish walks into a bar...
I’m not playing koi with you.
It's just like I imagined.
Yeah, buddy, so maybe I do. But it's "as", not "like".
Look buddy, I’m a fish so I can’t drown my sorrows. Now fill’er up again.
...and THEN she says, 'Time to fish or cut BAIT....' So cold, man. I loves her, but I lose either way.
I’m lookin’ to get sauced, not canned, pal!
In fact, “Drunk to the gills,” is an offensive stereotype.
I think I’d know what a dry drink would taste like. Those were definitely wet.”
Well, you drink like a camel, pal.
They made a movie about my parents' life. Ya, it even got an Academy Award as 'Best Picture' in 2018.
Barkeep! Another round. That worm is MINE!
No, seriously, I've never heard the one about the perch perched on a barstool.
...that may very well be, sir, but right now I’m a fish out of vodka.
What do you recommend? I'm a little wet behind the ears.
They say that I drink like a human!
No, I don’t “want the worm.” Why do you ask?
She left me for an invertebrate.
I knew she was cold-blooded, but I didn't think she'd spawn with my best friend.
Go ahead. Go ahead! Say it? Drinks like a what, Larry? DRINKS LIK A WHAT?
...Every guy with a shiny lure thinks I’ll go for it. Do they really think it’s that simple?
What's a plaice like me doing in a bar like this?
Yeah? And you breathe like a bartender.
She left me for a Yellowfin Tuna.
I'll have what the rabbi is having.
For the last time, the name is Gil ... one L, no S.
Yeah, you'd hit the booze too if your finances were in the toilet. I'm barely keeping my head below water.
Who  knew rising sea levels had an up side,  I'll  have another!
What do you mean you served me five seconds ago—I need a drink!
Don't for one minute think I'm just being koi.
But how sure are you that I won't turn into a gorgeous Princess if you kiss me?
What do you mean I have to wear shoes?
Fish aren't supposed to feel pain, she tells me.
Listen, Buster, if your girlfriend had just swum off with a lobster, you'd be slammin' shots too.
I know I drink like a fish, but even a fish out of water gets thirsty.
I'm just looking for a good lounge where you don't have to dance.
Ok,now I will try that mexican drink with the worm in it.  I am ready to be hooked
What do you mean it's not your policy to serve fish with scales?...
One Tequila with the worm in it
I fell for it hook line and sinker.
Im the one that got away.....
Can you make a wet martini?
I fell in love with a mermaid but you know what they say about mixed marriages
I'm parched.  I'll have a wet martini.
fillet up
And then I says to her "Yeah, well at least I don't smoke like a chimney"
Can you believe she said I drank like a fish?!?
What, you’ve never served tuna before?
Yeah, I've got dobie gills, plus, I've got a couple of mickey fins.
I’ll have my usual, a Cape Cod."
So,what's the me of the day?
I'd rather die of alcohol poisoning than be strangled by plastic six packs floating in the Pacific ocean.
For your information: I've never been tanked.
I used to drink like a fish.  Now I come to the bar like everyone else.
This place is shallow.
So I sez to her, "Ok since when was drinking like a fish a crime?"
I’ve been accused of drinking like a man
Since she left, I’ve been like a fish out of water!
Yes I'm huge but you should have seen the one that got away!
So a fish walked into a bar and ...

Listen up Bartender, if one more person tell me to Carp Diem I am need to find a new watering hole, even fish need to drown their sorrows!

My river has been stolen to water almond trees, so I thought maybe you could help me out.
No Marty, I'll tell YOU what's fishy

Just some water....a really large bowl
Seriously, I didn’t come here for water

I'd have another, but I think I am getting soused!
... in a tall glass with no ice.
I’ll have something with fly. Hold the ice.
Got any Te-COD-te?
A big fish on a small stool shooting tequila in a Greenwich Village bar: It's catchy line, right?

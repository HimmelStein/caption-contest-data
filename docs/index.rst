Welcome to caption-contest-data's documentation!
================================================

Every week, The New Yorker runs a Cartoon Caption Contest. That is, the draw a
cartoon and ask their readers for funny captions. They find the funniest
caption with our software, then publish the cartoon and funniest caption in
next week's edition.

We have been running the Caption Contest since 2016, and have recorded all the
data, including over 100 million human responses to over 10,000 captions in
over 100 contests.

This software package provides a Python API to get the recorded data.

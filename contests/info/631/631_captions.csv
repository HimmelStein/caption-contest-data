If I get it in the oven before we leave LaGuardia airspace, it's still New York pizza.
And of course, at altitude, things take longer to bake.
Hey at least I'm not tossing my cookies
You know, you really can't get a perfect thin crust unless you're at 35,000 feet

Unfortunately, I could only carry-on 3.4 ounces of sauce
Do you see me complaining that you’re doing your work?
No, TSA only cares about liquids.
I told them we should limit the distance of our free delivery service.
The cabin pressure really works wonders for the dough.
The advantage of flying is I don’t have  to use self-rising flour
It's plane pizza, no toppings.

My therapist says I’m a workaholic.
Are you working remotely today too?
Fresh delivery any where is our promise
Wanna become a member of the mile-pie club?

D.B. Cooper just ordered a pizza to go.
Yeah, me too, gotta do some prep before I get there.
I can only take the writeoff if I work while flying.
Sorry, I pledging for Phi Zeta Pi. This is just part of the hazing.
The good news is the atmosphere makes for an excellent crust. The bad news is each pizza costs a thousand dollars and arrives  seven hours late.
And that's why we should have never expanded our delivery range.
It's not an issue till I start the sauce.
Nothing like pizza when you’re this high.
Watch this...when we cross the Equator it'll spin the opposite direction!
And if the flight is delayed by 30 minutes, the pizza is free

My brother makes burgers on the subway, but I'm a pie in the sky kinda guy.

The trickiest part is getting olive oil past security.
I’m taking hand tossed to new heights.
It’s an emotional
support crust.
Think how fun this would be in zero gravity.
You work during the flight, why can't I?
I'm sorry, it's for guests in our first-class cabin.
I wish I had enough dough for first class.
So what did you learn on YOUR tour of Italy?
It's New York's first plane-tossed. Sells well, but shuttle schedules and TSA regulations are killing our supply chain.
This way I don't have to put it under the seat in front of me.
As long as it keeps coming back down, we're good.
You're the first one who's noticed.

Actually, I'm an accountant; why do you ask?
Who'd suspect I'm the air marshal?
I could only find the high-altitude recipe.
....And that brings me back to my original point which is 'Dress for the job you WANT'
Let me know if this is bothering you.
Delivery is extra
Everything in my life is a bit up in the air at the moment.
Is this bothering you?
I'd spring the extra dough for First Class, but its 'Gluten Free'...
It started with fidget spinning and turned into this.
It has to be there in ten minutes or it’s free.

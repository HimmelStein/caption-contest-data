This folder contains data from the New Yorker caption contest. In this contest,
participants are asked to rate different captions. The rating methods varied
among the experiments and more detail is included in the individual folder.

| Question                   | App              | Contests      |
| :--:                       | :--:             | :---:         |
| How funny is this caption? | Cardinal bandits | >= 499        |
| Which caption is funnier?  | Dueling bandits  | 497, 508, 509 |

| Algorithm type | Contests                                         |

| Adaptive       | All contests, under the label "lilUCB"           |
| Non-adaptive   | <= 519, under the label "random" or "roundrobin" |

**Adaptive algorithms** make decisions on which captions to ask based on
previous ratings -- their goal is to determine the funniest caption as quickly
as possible. Therefore, they tend to ask about funny captions.

**Non-adaptive algorithms** make no decisions based on past data. We consider
this data to be un-biased. It makes no decisions about previous answers about
which question to ask. Every caption has an equal probability of being asked.

* [497]: This data presented participants with two captions and asked the user
  to choose the funniest caption. It has roughly **23k responses.**
* [499]: This contains the data from an experiment included in a video from
  Robert Mankoff's desk titled "[Cartoon Lounge: Show Me the Funny]". This
  experiment provided the caption "rate the below caption as unfunny, somewhat
  funny or funny." It has roughly **103k responses**.
* [505]: Another cartoon contest. We have roughly **123k responses** for **377
  participants**. This experiment recruited participants through a New Yorker
  mailing list.
* [507] through [513]: each experiment has roughly **100k** responses from less
  than 500 participants. These participants were previous caption contest
  winners. 507 through 513 have roughly 700k responses total. 508 and 509 have
  both types of experiments (both cardinal and dueling bandits)
* [514]: Roughly **200k** responses from **10k** participants. This experiment
  was hosted on http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/vote and participants were
  recruited by the New Yorker more generally (through a mailing list)

Plaid is my favorite season.
They grow up so fast.
Falling for you
Ah that makes me so sappy
On day, theyâ€™ll make a house out of us.
It won't last - they have no roots.
Plaid has always been my favorite season.

Don't leave!
Follow the mellow chick road.
Sure, we have a tough winter ahead to endure. But six months from now we'll be in the middle of the rebirth vibrance and hope. Such is the natural cycle of life here in Washington, D.C.
I remember when they were just saplings.
Every little Breeze seems to whisper Louise.
Aren't they cute?
It almost makes me want to forgive them for carving their initial in me years ago.
I love seeing the plaid colors this time of year.
Yes!!!
" I think I'm falling for you".
I think she's Falling for him.
I wish we could do that.
Interested in a treesome?
Aw, they're using their limbs to embrace each other. I would drop these leaves and strangle the crap out of you.
He's a lumberjack, but he's o.k.
Their roots are showing.
Two's company, tree's a crowd.
Doesn't that guy remind you of Bob Ross?
All the wood loves a lover.
I think they're about to cross-pollinate!
Falling in love
I love the Fall colors.
I remember when we were young and sappy.
??=????
let's leave them alone
Imagine how awkward - four trunks, joined at the top, and moving.
Ah, to be young and rootless.
Reminds me of us. Before we grew apart.
I wish we could do plaid.
What a sap!
I'm leafing too.
I hope they put down roots.
Reminds me of us when we were saplings.
Hey, welcome to the enchanted forest... prepare to die
They look like the perfect couple, if not for their checked past.
... and you thought we were sappy.
Remember when we were saplings?
Timblr is quite popular out here.
I think the LSD is kicking in.
I think they are about to pollinate
Look like they are ready to put down roots.

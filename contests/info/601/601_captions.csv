I thought you said it wouldn't need much attention.
You know how they say that in the Spring, the desert comes alive?
We'll lose him in the swimming and biking stages.
Something tells me the peyote is staring to kick in.
I told you not to water it. Now it's going to follow us home.
Looks like we're not the only ones who want out before he builds that wall...
Hon, remember that little cactus we let die on the window sill?
Next time just relieve yourself against a rock.
Don't look now, but some prick is following us.
Sorry, we only hug trees.
He just wants to say aloe.
I'm pretty sure the peyote has kicked in.
I think the peyote is finally kicking in.
I'm telling you it's the SAME CACTUS.
The wall was dumb, but these border guard disguises are even worse.
Obviously, he's a deserter.
Why couldn't you just pee behind a bush?
How come it leaves footprints and we don't?
Why couldn’t he just follow us on Twitter?
OK, when we get to the border, just act natural.
I’m pretty sure it’s a saguaro, but I think you’re missing the point.
The desert scenery is really moving.
Did you really have to call it spineless?
The good news is we've outrun the ficus.
He just wants to say aloe.
Sure, he's keeping up now; wait 'til we get to the bike and the swim.
"Try some Peyote," You said, "What Could It Hurt?" You said......
We're 70% water. Run!
Honey I think this prick is following us.
I know you're a botanist, but couldn't we just get a dog?
You're doing great, but try using your arms, more.
Keep moving. He's a hugger.
I think it knows we're 60% water!
I warned you not to give it water.
The peyote is kicking in.
I love morning runs, the scenery really comes alive.
No, if it were more than one I would have said cacti!
Honey, I think you dropped your Viagra.
This guy following us is a real prick
No, the hallucinations don't usually start until at least the 50th mile or so. Why do you ask?
By any chance, were there ever nuclear tests in this desert?
You have to admit, he's in good shape for a 170 year old.
It must be an invasive species.
Honey, is this where those nuclear tests were done in the nineteen fifties?
Just pay him for the selfie.
The U.S. Border Patrol's methods are unconventional, but it's cheaper than building a wall.
Maybe we do need a wall.
I know we can't take one, but if it follows us home...
You were right, dear. The Cactus Run is much less stressful than last week's Cheetah Run.
Those new Border Patrol disguises aren't fooling anybody.
What was it you said about global warming and plant migration?
I told you it would follow us home if you watered it.
Cactus if you can!
It may be my imagination, but I think Mexico is giving us the finger.
Just follow us. There’s still one acre of federally protected land left!
He's searching for his roots.
I think the peyote's working!
I told you not to pee on it.
Hurry! If we run, he’ll never cactus.
It's a mirage a trois.
He’s been able to skip every water station so far.
I told you not to pet it. Now it's following us home.
This is good peyote.
I never expected shrinking the National Parks would lead to this kind of backlash.
I'll just remind you that the park ranger said not to encourage them.
It's not the first time our day has been ruined by an annoying prick, is it honey?
Remember when I said global warming will bring changes we can't even imagine?
I think the peyote tea we drank this morning is catching up with us.
I think I know how foreigners are getting into Arizona.
"Hey, why aren't we making any footprints?
He's gaining on us, would you just give him the damn water bottle.
Didn't they used to test nukes around here?
I’ve changed my mind about GMOs.
We're ahead but he doesn't need as much water as we do.
I told you you should have peed somewhere else.
"It'll be fun," you said. "I bet peyote isn't even that strong," you said.
And I thought Burning Man couldn't get any weirder.
Arms lower. Lean into it.
What surprises me is how he got over that wall.
Don't run. It's trying to surrender.
If only he has footprints, are we the mirage?
Wait, honey, I think it's trying to surrender.
Just act natural. They sense hydration.
Run faster! I think it wants a hug.
Well they did say the landscape would be moving.
Gumby? Is that you?
Sweetie, don't look now but that prick is following us
You know that prickling sensation you get when someone’s following you?
When we get to the border, let me do the talking.
You had to pee on the cactus, didn't you?
I take it back honey, your boss isn't the biggest prick I've ever seen
you could have peed anywhere, but NO !
Honey, I think the peyote has kicked in.
Poor guy, I can’t imagine how chafed his inner thighs must be.
I think we all know who the bigger prick is now.
Remember that housewarming gift you threw out?
Don't worry, we will pull way ahead during the swimming event.
It's easier if you swing your arms.
A scene from the lesser-known movie: "Cactus If You Can."
It's easier if you put your arms down.
“We’re no where near Area 51, Elise. Why do you ask?
Speed it up! Coming in last this time will REALLY be embarrassing!
Do you think it knows we are 60% water?
Good to see these endangered species are finally getting proactive.
You're positive you didn't tell your ex-wife where we were going?
If we keep him, he'll have to sleep in his own bed.
It's not the heat, it's the absurdity.
I told you not to water it, now it won't leave us alone.
I don't think he's going to stop until he gets a hug.
Hey! Do you guys have a second to talk about our Lord and savior Jesus Christ?
Peyote's kicking in, hon.
You know that "runner's high" they talk about?
It's still not as strange as some of the people who follow us on Twitter.
I think he’s doing a dry run.
I think he's angry because you called this place a sh**hole!
We must be getting close to Area 51.
Cactus if you can!
He knows this is a triathalon, right?
I could have sworn we passed that cactus miles ago.
I... don't... have... to... out run... the cactus... Just... need... to run... faster... than... my wife.
Looks like something that happened in Vegas doesn't want to stay in Vegas.
He's just needling us.
It's OK, he's close... but no saguaro.
Perhaps “spineless” wasn’t the best choice of words.
I think the peyote is kicking in.
He's going to cactus!
Honey...remember when you said tequila was a terrible chaser?
I keep getting that prickly feeling on the back of my neck.....
Shoo! We only hug TREES
Looks like he wants a hug.
Remember this the next time you want to relieve yourself on a cactus!
So... how long has your dad been in witness protection?
Run faster! It's still trying to cactus.
I don't have to outrun it, I only have to outrun you.
The mescaline is kicking in.
This border protection thing is getting out of hand.
We had a great time, we're just not huggers.
Come back! I’m going to make the desert great again!
You never should have called him spineless.
Remember when you said that GMOs are safe?
Hold up Ted, I think it's trying to surrender.
What's the first sign of heat stroke again?
Well, howdy Hopalong Cactussy !!
We're in trouble if HE is following US to find water
The scenery around here is really moving.
Yeah, we're a little downwind from the old atomic bomb test sites, why?
Great, now it isn't even trying to freeze when I turn around.
When they said "The living Desert", they weren't kidding.
We should have never taken that peyote.
I think it might just want a hug.
All I said was, "Hey, Saguaro, what kind of guano hole country do you come from?"
I don't have to outrun the cactus. I just have to outrun you.
Of course you can run with us, just no more high fives, got it?
Say Bob, do you know anything about the side effects of peyote?
I've been running from pricks my whole life.
I think that border agent just blew his cover.
I think we spoiled him in the suburbs—he’s too entitled to go back to the wild now.
Please aloe me to introduce myself!
He may be slow, but he won't need a water break for months.
Honey, do you remember that little cactus plant your Mom gave us and we threw out?
I wonder why we don't leave footprints.
I told you he was an obnoxious prick
This might just be the peyote talking, but I actually feel okay about this whole situation.
I think the environment is trying to surrender.
Sure, you call yourselves tree huggers.
Last one there pays for the wall.
I told you that jogging around Area 51 was a bad idea.
Look, we're just not really the hugging types.
I believe he's looking for his roots.
The shaman said this is totally normal.
Besides dry mouth, what are some other signs of dehydration?
We're definitely lost. I'm certain this same cactus chased us an hour ago.
This isn't what I meant by a desert getaway.
We've passed it 4 times now - after every race rest stop.
I told you not to water it.
We can't just desert him.
I think the peyote just kicked in.
Your mother has NOT learned to respect our space.
I don't know why people are so impressed. His form is terrible and he never hydrates properly.
Maybe you were right. I shouldn't talk to plants.
It must be dry humor week at The New Yorker.
Now that's an invasive species!
All I said was "Nice succulent!."
Can you guys slow down? My spines are acting up.
I love these new mobile cell towers.
Let's speed up. I don't want to get stuck out here.
I think the peyote is kicking in.
This is our new border security?
This may be the best trainer we’ve ever hired.
it's moving to Canada...
This is nothing. For a high impact workout they send a tumbleweed.
“No, it’s not “just like acupuncture”!
Can we skip high fives at the finish?
Oh, he can be such a prick!
He keeps complaining about plant fasciitis.
No, its Homeland Security.
I have an idea, but we'll need Mexico to pay for it.
Tag is fine with me, as long as we don’t have to play Leapfrog again.
It's either a mirage or that cactus is really pleased to see me.
Did you happen to step on a baby cactus?
Um... remember when you laughed and yelled "Cactus if you can!"
Looks like we might be stuck with him.
Are you fleeing Trump’s America too?
Did you ever notice that there's never a wall when you need one?
I think it wants us to have a mirage-et-trois!
Where did you pee Jeff?
If he follows us home, we’ll be stuck with him
I think the runner's high is starting to kick in.
The Abominable Snowman adapts to Global Warming.
I don’t care if he just wants a hug!
With his cover blown ten minutes into the mission, Officer Day gave chase in his camouflage and wondered if he had put enough research into the native flora of Upstate New York
Honey, I think the peyote is kicking in!
Hurry Dan! I am not finishing behind the cactus again!
Looks like Homeland Security got their budget increase
Enough with the drama Shirley , we’re all thirsty
The peyote is kicking in.
That guy behind us is a total prick.
Group hug!
You had to get a cutting.
No, if it were more than one I would have said cacti!
Tomorrow I'm using the treadmill.
I refuse to lose another 5k to some jerk in a stupid costume.
I'm sorry! It was insensitive to call you "an invasive species!"
Even here, they have binge drinkers.
Weird! We don't have any footprints!
I don't think we can outrun it. I've heard they can go a long time without water.
We don't have any water! Go away!
It’s definitely kicking in now, Chad. Best Burning Man ever!
Who knew succulents had a dry sense of humor?
Hey remember that cactus you peed on?
This is the part of global warming no one ever warned us about!
We're half water. It knows.
"Honey, remember that little cactus from the sunroom... you said, "It's dead, just throw it out"?
Those border patrol agents are getting sneaky
who is that prick following us?
Honey, run faster. Some prick is following us.
He says this is a stick up.
Remember when I was saying nothing very interesting ever happens around here?
On your left!
Yes, Jerry - weirder than us not having footprints.
Are you sure your wife doesn't know about us?
What's he all up-in-arms about ?
He's not fast, but he's well hydrated
We're looking for water, too.
I thought you said Burning Man was next week.
I think we have a thorny problem.
Run before he sticks it to us!
Well, I guess it's cheaper than the wall.
They really do have a shallow root system.
I told you to water the cactus before it starts running dry.
Pick up the pace, honey. I don't want to get stuck here.
When is the peyote supposed to wear off?
Amy wondered, if it came to it, could she kill a cactus as easily as her houseplants?
I told you peyote wasn't a performance drug.
To him, we're succulent as well.
So, peyote does what now?
I think it's just sleep walking. I can hear it sonoran.
I swear, no matter where we run the pricks keep following us.
No, I'm not using a Freudian metaphor; turn around and look at it.
Wow, everyone is trying to get out of this shit hole.
Is that prick still behind us?
Did you order a chaser after that last maguerita?
I'm starting to think that taking peyote before a run was a really bad idea.
Oh God, it's just a dream, I can only handle one prick at a time.
I think Border Patrol is going a little too far.
I mean... He has some good points.
As usual, Gary was oblivious to the succulent harrassment Diane had to deal with every day.
Let's not jog through the Nevada Nuclear Test Site anymore.
Just ignore it, Julia. It's just another running gag.
Sweetie, what kind of mushrooms did you put in that omelet?
We should've gotten a dog.
Run. He's free-range.
Run faster, honey. He looks like a real prick.
We might want to pick up the pace a little.
Not to worry. It's surrendering.
Stop talking. It's attracted to your dry humor.
How long ago did we take the peyote?
Drat! Looks like one of Trump's border security cactuses is trailing us again.
Eight miles in, and he still hasn't stopped for water.
So unfair...he doesn't have to stop at the water stations!
Oh, so this is runner's high.
Maybe you shouldn't have called him spineless...
Honey, what do you get when you mix global warming and nuclear fallout?
Bet he blows right through the next water stop.
How long has that prick been following us?
You shouldn't have called him spineless.
Oh, Bill, he just wants a hug.
Stop running! It's just trying to surrender...
Looks like Joe Arpaio's Senate run officially started.
Do you remember that article we didn’t believe about species migration due to climate change?
Look, it must be the new border security!
He’s emigrating from Bears Ears National Monument and asking for asylum.
You said peyote does what again?
Lois, I told you not to feed it, now its going to follow us home.
Howard, I think he just wants a hug.
Better pick it up or we're gonna get stuck out here!
Watch out; it's armed!
Killers, rapists, and CACTUSES. He forgot to mention the cactuses.
Honey, look. A cactus with a carbon footprint
See what happens when you over water a cactus.
Just ignore it -we'll head it off at the next mirage.
He's a bit of a prick, but he's a good runner
For the last time, you cannot interest us in a timeshare!
Try pumping your arms a little.
He's doing very well for a 200-year-old Saguaro.
How come Cactus Bob leaves tracks and we don't.
Wait! He's surrendering.
Since this is clearly a dream, why aren't you better looking?
No, Jim, I don't think it's just the peyote.
I think this prick is following us.
No, ICE uniforms look different.
It's not as fast as the snowman.
Apparently he wasn't held much as a child.
It can't be much farther to Burning Man.
Strange, yes, Harry, but I think even stranger that we don't leave any footprints as we run.
Next time, let's not order the cactus chaser with the tequila.
Honey, what are the symptoms of runner's high?
How can a cactus leave footprints when we don't.
Remember how I said my Ex was a big prick who wouldn't stop following me around?
But Lord - Why is there only one set of footprints?
I think I’m being stalked!
I think he’s better than our last personal trainer.
Why did you provoke him? I told you he was prickly.
Might be a good idea not to mention you voted for Trump next time we visit Death Valley
Babe, look, it's Gumby's weird cousin.
Sorry, but I think your personal trainer is a real prick.
Trump's new plan for border security.
Honey, can you list off side effects of climate change again?
The bad news is, we're going to have to stop for water before it does.
Why don’t we leave footprints?
No David, I didn't say I'm out of practice, I said there's a...
Hurry up, Frank. He is going to cactus.
I don’t know, honey, this new trainer’s kind of a prick.
Wow, even the plants in our National Parks are running scared from this administration...
I told you not to pee on it.
Honey...I'm pretty sure that sign DID say 'Area 51'.
This is the best personal trainer we've had yet
How come we're not leaving footprints?
I think I’m experiencing my first ‘runner’s high.’
"What's the harm," you said, "of snapping off one pointy spine to get what's stuck between your teeth," you said.
I think it’s trying to surrender.
We can stop running, Jim. He surrenders.
This is no time to discuss the correct plural of cactus!
Well, it’s prickly, stiff, and pretending to surrender. I think it’s your dad.
Wait, I think he has a thorn in his foot.
You really should stop and hydrate.
I TOLD you this is where they used to test atom bombs!!!
I think we're being stalked...
Don't worry, it's just a dry run.
Slow poke.
He’s pretty speedy for a succulent
Just let your arms swing more naturally.
He's been up in arms since this desert started to get gentrified.
For a two hundred year old he can run pretty fast.
Story of my life: one small prick and now he won't leave me alone.
That prick is trying to pass us.
It wants a forever home. How do we tell it we live in Buffalo?
I'm sure it seems just as strange to him that we're running in the desert.
This is where I pass you, Ed.
Honey, we have to raise our hands, it's an arms race.
It's still upset over my affair with the Christmas tree.
It wasn't the first time a giant prick had approached her from behind.
I just need a hug!
Maybe you should not have peed on that cactus!
We must be going in circles. That cactus has passed us before.
Hurry up, I think he wants a hug
Stop following us you prick
We're being followed by Gumby's Mexican cousin.
The latest in high tech border security.
If DACA gets extended, you won't have to wear it.
Here today, gone saguaro.
When you described your trainer as succulent, I imagined something else.
You know that cactus you said looked so alone out here?
Seems everybody is trying to get in their 10,000 steps these days.
Pick up the pace, I think it's going to cactus.
You picked the wrong cactus to pee on.
He's a rather a prickly character. I'd keep my distance if I was you.
Their tequila marketing program is exceptional.
I thought Spike was the name of your dog.
How will we know when the peyote kicks in?
Run faster before he sticks it to us!
I think he's trying to get out before he get's stuck with the bill for the wall.
I think it's one of those new border patrol agents.
Why do good trainers all gotta be such pricks?
I'm not sure if it's just needling us.
I thought you said the Nevada Test Site was no longer radioactive.
I'm going to be accused of fake news, I just know it!
He's been gaining ground ever since we pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords.
That's far enough. You've made your point.
I’m okay with it as long as it doesn’t try to high five me at the finish line.
I think that peyote we took at mile 22 is catching up with us.
Don't you find the scenery here very moving?
Did Mexico agree to pay for one large cactus instead?
Bob...this is the LAST time we're jogging near Area 51.
Run, it's a stickup!
That's the last time we order cactus chasers after our margaritas!
I heard they grow by sending out runners.
Couldn't we just have gotten a Fitbit for motivation?
Are you sure those mushrooms were safe to eat?
I think it just wants a hug.
What did you say your ex looked like?
Are you sure that was just tequila?
Honey, is there a running of the cacti like in Pamplona?
Now that Trump is in office, the illegal aliens are becoming more creative.
Step up the pace; we're about to be passed by a vegetable.
Honey, what were those symptoms of dehydration again?
Forget the rattlesnakes and poisonous spiders, I've got one more for you.
Run until he turns into tequila.
This living desert thing is starting to freak me out!
I told you not to water it.
Maybe just carrying a water bottle would have been a better idea.
Why am I always followed by giant pricks.
Will you please tell your mother she’s not fooling anybody.
We do feel your pain but can't embrace it.
Maybe it just wants a hug.
" Harry, remember those mushrooms we had at lunch"?
Hey Charles, are you seeing this guy running in front of me, or is the peyote kicking in?
John, when you texted Grinder, did you ask for tall dark and horny, or tall dark and thorny?
Say, about your ex-girlfriend, the one you described as "succulent"...
Absolutely not, Fiona. No more stray plants!
I've read that global warming is already speeding up evolution.
Relax. He's in a different qualifying heat.
I ordered tequila—not a cactus chaser!
What did Trump pay THEM to guard the border???
Oh, this is just a dry run.
No wait, I think he is trying to surrender.
I think I would much prefer the wall
I know he’s cute but he’ll just be a thorn in your side
I think it wants you to pee on it again.
Faster – it wants a hug.
Herb! Don’t look now but that prick from the hotel is following us.
Don't stop. He knows we're full of water.
I told you we shouldn't come to the park during the Government shutdown.
Maybe they were right about climate change AND evolution.
I think I'm over my fear of bears.
That prick is still following us
Is Mexico paying for that too?
Hey, Hon? I have something that will take your mind right off that blister.
That cactus must have gotten a fitbit for Christmas too.
This prick also wants to follow me on Instagram.
Just how close are we to Area 51?
Did you notice, it just breezed by the last water station.
We didn't mean to offend you, "succulent" and "prickly" are just descriptive adjectives!
Come back, it's free hugs Friday!
how do we tell him we don't want a hug?
Hope I'm that fast when I'm 200.
Stop. Maybe it just wants a hug.
I know it can go longer between water stops! That's not what worries me.
We're legal, Mr. Trump.
I hate that guy... he's such a prick!
I think we should just let him pass us.
I just wonder if he'll get along with our walking palm.
Every time desert is spelled with one 's' a cactus gets his wings.
Chased by a succulent... check.
He knows that our bodies are sixty per cent water.
He won't settle down until he finds his roots.
He has an unfair advantage .... he doesn't have to hydrate!
That prick is still following us
They say the desert never really leaves you.
I thought your ex lived in the Sahara.
It thinks you said catch us, not cactus!
Run faster! That prick’s closing in!
Must be a deserter.
Doesn't it bug you that it's the only one of us leaving footprints?
Was this in the brochure?!
He's just trying to find his roots.
You could have resisted calling him a succulent!
Keep hydrated!
That stupid prick just won't go away!
Why is it signalling a touchdown ?
Honey I think this prick is following us.
He says he just wants us to get him out of this s$&@hole.
I only want a hug!
Cac-walk.
I always attract the pricks
I think he saw the water bottles.
Prick.
You shouldn't have fed him, Ralph, now he's going to follow us home!
You think we can go back to the days when they were only sending rapists?
How much further to the mirage?
Pick up the pace—we don’t want to be stuck with this guy.
Somehow he understood the "Hands up" but not the "Don't move" part.
This would never have happened if Trump had built his wall.
Wow,someone's taking this Cactus Run way too literally.
I don't think it liked when you said it was "spineless".
Joe, stop. He's trying to tell us something.
All I want is a hug.
I'm never drinking tequila again.
It has a dry sense of humor.
Talk about invasive
"I don't know if the plural is cactuses or cacti - JUST RUN!'
Uh-oh, this one's a hugger.
Relax, you can join us, but no hugging.
Honey, I think he’s excited to see me.
I guess the drought is worse than we thought.
Great, I knew we shouldn't have gone so near the old a-bomb test site.
No more hugs!!
I don't get it... he's run this whole race and hasn't stopped for water.
Do you have time to talk about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?
I knew it was called the Saguaro 5K, but....
For a succulent you must admit he's got good form.
These mirages are getting more aggressive.
I think government surveillance has gone too far!
I hate crossing the free range cactus ranch.
Speed up, I heard he is kind of a prick.
I didn't know that cacti put out runners!
Is this runner's high?
Keep running, Marcy! Climate change displacement is real.
Wait, he's got his hands up.
Jack, what’s tall, green, spiny and jogs in the desert?
We're in trouble. He will never need a water break.
Don't stop, it's still trying to cactus
It’s the boulder following him that worries me.
I told you not to pet it. Now it's following us home.
I think the last night's mezcal is catching up with me.
I know we’re not supposed to take a cactus out of the wilderness area, but he seems to have developed an attachment.
Who comes to the desert dressed like that?!?!
Keep it up. He’s running dry.
Fred sure has a running outfit for every ocassion
He’s after our fluids.
Promise me, Steve...no more Peyote!
Not me! It's your dry wit he's attracted to.
Ugh, that prick is still following us
It was hard finding you guys, you don't leave any tracks!
No, Fred, stop. I think it just wants to talk.
Well at least we won't come in last!
Look Donald! Big hands. Big prick.
Excuse me! Do you know the fastest way around the wall?
They weren’t shiitake mushrooms!!
Honey, I'm fairly certain we are being pursued by a real pain in the ass.
He'll finish. He's got great form and an unlimited water supply.
I'm caught between two pricks.
Faster – it wants a hug.
I am emigrating, since I have never made deep roots in Mexico.
He gets a little prickly when he loses.
Honey, I think we're in a bit of a prickle.
Back off! Hell hath no fury like a woman thorned.
It may be GMO but happy to see it's free range
When you said you ex was a 'little prickly', what exactly did you mean?
You shouldn't have been so argumentative, Bob. He has some good points.
Maybe genetically modified cactus wasn't your best idea.
Dad, if he follows us home, can we keep him?
In two years he will have to stop for water and we can gain some ground on him.
I think he's afraid we'll desert him.
I feel so good about adopting instead of buying one from a cacti farm.
Climate change is catching up, Leonard.
You're sure this isn't a nuclear test area?
Honey, don't look now but we're being followed by a big prick.
C’mon guys—don’t desert me.
Atticus, a cactus has attacked us!
You just had to call him a spineless coward
I hate pricks.
You're right ... it IS funnier without a caption
Who wants a hug?
You'll make better time if you pump your arms.
Don't worry, it's not in our age division.
Adios tourists! Go back to your shithole country!
Cacti or cactuses? Who knew he would be so prickly about it.
You ever get that feeling that maybe we aren't as fast as we used to be?
He must want a mirage a trois.
Once you give them a little water, they'll follow you everywhere.
These new border guards are real pricks.
It's just another dry run.
Hey! Don’t go!” I know it looks like a big middle finger.. but I just wanted to welcome you to Arizona!
Is this one of those bad hombres we've been hearing about?
I love that it's a living desert.
Now that’s a dry run

Looks like it's going to stick with us.
Who's a 'proud hippy tree-hugger' now, huh?
He must chafe like crazy.
I sure hope the wall isn’t up yet.
I told you not to water it more than once a week!
He was member of Cactaceae crime family in Arizona before witness protection brought him here.
Looks like the U.S. government couldn't afford a wall...
At least it's a dry kind of hot pursuit.
Go faster...he wants a hug!
Hey, it's me, Gumby! I just couldn't shave today. Really!
Definitely an improvement over the pet rock...
They’re cute when they’re little but then they grow up to be such monsters.

I just need to outrun you.
I hate jogging with this prick.
Honey, I think that prick is following us again.
We don't want to play the hokey pokey with you!
Forget the aloe, Vera.
I do one search about a cactus, and it pops up everywhere and follows me around.
If you can't keep up with us, your nothing more than a thorn in our side.
We will never outrun him, he is drought tolerant!
Come back! Don't desert me!
It's not the fauna I'm worried about, Bob.
Don't look now, but there's a big prick behind us.
These days you can't go anywhere without some prick trying to touch you.
I've got a prickly feeling we are being followed.

Prick.
Harvey, forget the snakes.
Looks like the base has been mobilized.
Honey, did you leave the cactus running?
Look, it's following us North, must be global warming.

Paranoid, schmaranoid! I tell you we're being followed.
He must be in great shape. I can't even hear him photosynthesize.
I think the recreational marijuana is kicking in.

I suppose this is what we get for trying to harvest our own aloe vera.
The Arizona primary is getting weird.
This has to be climate change related.
It's okay, he's got his hands up.
Maybe all he wants is a hug.
Honey hurry! That cacti is going to cactus!!
Hurry! Our hallucinations are catching up with us!
How strong was that peyote?
I told you not to call it a giant pickle!

He probably just needs a hug.
It's nice here, but not the kind of place to put your roots down.
I think I realize why they call this the Cactus 5K
So, Bob, what exactly did you mean by "nature walk"?
Hey honey, I think the drugs are finally kicking in.
Bob! I told you that eating peyote before we jog isn't a good idea!
So much for that restraining order.
Yes, he’s losing more than us, but it’s mostly water weight.
But, I thought a mirage was supposed to be in front of you.
Don't look at me. I'm dying for a drink of water, too.

Catch as Catch Can but Can Cactus Catchus?
A stickup? Really?
You warned me not to water it: Now the damn thing has imprinted on me!

I've never seen him stop for water.
The guides on the trip are really authentic.

Maybe we should turn off our trackers.

Talk about walking on pins and needles.
Certainly more menacing than that prickly pear that followed us last year.
Alexa, this wasn't what I meant by running spikes
Remind me again why we're jogging through the Nevada test site?
Honey is that prick still following us?

Fred, you definitely stopped in the wrong place to pee.
You guys run ahead. I'm getting that needles n' pins thing.
Did you water the plants?
Well the first one was all wrong, so I said send me a two-foot cactus, make it attractive, and make it quick.
Honey, I think there is a cactus following us--or is it cacti--I never can remember.
Our trainer is such a prick.
Wait! I just want a hug! I'm lonely.
I'm thinking, not a good day to be a tree-hugger!
We're also trying to lose some water weight.
Wouldn’t it have been easier to carry a water bottle?
You talk to him. I already told him we don't do threesomes.
All I have to do is just outrun you.
You're a real prick, man.
I feel that Peyote is really kicking in
He's not going to let us desert him.

He’ll win. The fact that he doesn’t have to stop for water is a real competitive advantage.
It's heading north, climate change you know!
Yes, but is a giant-walking-death-cactus ever just a giant-walking-death-cactus?
OK, so now I'm in favor of a wall.
Your arms are going to cramp up like that.

Wait. Who told you I was a prick?
He's got tremendous stamina but you really have to stay on top of him about hydrating.
Now that's a run for the border!
I don’t think you understand Jimmy. He’s saying this is a stick up.
"Is the peyote working for you yet"?

His form is going to really mess up his spine in the long run.
I'm beginning to change my mind about denying climate change.
It knows we are 98% water.
Come to think of it, maybe that WAS peyote tea.
He seems to be taking the drought in stride.
Honey, it's your turn to give it a hug today.
On your right....
I think we're being followed. I'm getting a prickly sensation.

He's fine. He doesn't need a water break.
I think I mixed up our power bars with the peyote.
He'll turn out to be spineless.
Bill, It just ate our shadows.
We should never have tried that peyote followed by a tequila chaser.
HAVE YOU NOTICED WE AREN'T LEAVING ANY TRACKS?

I knew we should have built that wall!
He's not wearing a Fit Bit, so he can't be serious about it.
Next time, I'm booking the vacation!

Even the desert is full of pricks trying to harass me.
The runner behind us is a giant prick.
'It's mostly water.' You said. 'They need water.' You said. 'I can't wait to go.' You said. 'It's no big deal.' You said. Well, it looks mad to me.

Didn't we pass that cactus two dunes back?
John! You have to turn around and see this! It’s amazing! They’re running without a Fitbit!
I hope he doesn't need a hug.
Must be the enhanced border security.
Now do you believe me about global warming?
The kids are getting better at tracking us.
I thought once we were married, I’d been be done fighting off pricks.
marco polo!
I think it's a global warning.
Did you lie to the CIA about this trip?
Well that's the last time I take LSD right before a run
This prick just won’t stop.

I feel like the peyote is starting to kick in.
It seems friendly...maybe it was deserted.
This running group is full of pricks.
I told you never to make eye contact with the cacti!

Couldn’t we just carry a water bottle like others?
This is the last time we commune with nature.
I think it just wants to give us a hug. So keep moving.

If it follows us home, can we keep it?
Maybe it's time to join a gym
I don't think it's going to stay in Vegas!

Saguaro see, saguaro do.
Why did you ask him to play tag?
You're right, those weren't edible mushrooms.
Come on Guys, I saw you take a selfie with the Prickly PEAR earlier, don't make me beg.
Can we keep him, if he follows us home?
That reminds me: we should probably stop for some water.
'Wait. I think it's surrendering."
You shouldn't have complained about his prickly personality.
Yippie-ka-yay that was good peyote.
Who the hell told you we are tree huggers?
How did it get past the border wall?

If we had a better pet, we could jog in more interesting places.
This is why we need The Wall
I thought they were supposed to be slow.
Remember the cactus back there you went the bathroom on...

If he follows us home, can we keep him?
Hey guys, wait up. Did you every hear the one about the epiphytic succulent?
Honey, some prick is following us.
Sally! It's me!
Okay, okay, we don't have to hug, but can we just talk? It gets lonely out here.

Your brother has a dry sense of humor!
Is that all the border security they had money for?

Poor thing. 60 million years to optimize hydration and it can barely keep up.
Uh, I doubt you'll ever call him a 'Prick' again.
Hurry up! We don't have an agricultural permit to move you.
We can make it, I’m pretty sure he isn’t sufficiently hydrated.
That Prick is Closing In On Us!
That prick won't take 'no' for an answer.
Reminds me of my first date.
What's this prick want?
Quit worrying. If anybody's going to make it over the border wall it's going to be you.
It’s just a dry run.
You didn’t mention having Secret Service protection.
The newest in "post wall" border security.
I wish that prick would stop following us.
Slow down. He's having a hard time keeping up.
I quit peyote but I don't think the peyote quit me.
It works!.. Now, if they all hold hands we have the perfect "Genetic Engineered" wall that's impossible to climb.. and we can move it wherever we want!
That timeshare salesman is still on our tail.
One of us is a mirage.
Not sure who this prick is behind us.
Maybe some of those restrictive EPA regulations weren't so bad after all...
I think he wants to see our papers.
It wants your Fitbit.
Just throw down your Evian bottle and run!
Man, is he going to stick it to us!
Don’t run! I can assure you I’m not a giant sex toy.
C'mon, I'd fit in your living room!
Say "cactus can't catch us" three times fast
Hey guys! I think you left your headlights on.
I told you we should have voted for the wall!
Maybe the wall isn't such a bad idea
I think he wants us to do something about global warming.
Damn those nuclear bomb tests!
It's ok hunny! He's not a stalker, just a prick.
Wait. I just want a hug!
I guess his New Years resolution was also to start moving more.
Please! I just need a hug.
I'm trying to remember how you know when you're dehydrated.
Honey, this prick is still following us.
Strange, I thought walking cacti were extinct.
This gives "green footprint" a whole other meaning!
Saguaro you following us?
The doctor says he’s retaining too much water.
The one time I wish it was a mirage!
How do you manage to stay hydrated?
Better pick up the pace Hon....that cactus wants a hug!
I told you not to give it a drink; now it's following us.
Hurry! I'm afraid we'll need water before he does.
Your costume is succulent.
Now you're just being a prick.
And when there were only one set of footprints in the sand know that it was I, the Cact-lord, who carried you.
That prick is actually following us!
Hold your water! We're almost there...
Maybe we shouldn't have eaten his peyote buds.
You pissed on the wrong prick.
They didn’t mention this feature in the brochure.
It doesn't look Norwegian.
Mirage, smirage, I still think it's following us.
When Steve goes local, he really commits.
The point of this exercise is to not get the point.
Sometimes a saguaro is just a saguaro.
"I'm not the fastest, but I never need to stop for water.
Did you really have to call him “Rocket Man”? I told you he was prickly!
I don't understand why he is signaling a touchdown.
He insists the etymology isn't Latin.
I think he wants to give us a hug.
If he catches up with us, we will be dealing with a sticky situation.
He is still trying to surrender to us!
The desert is gaining on us!
I get the feeling the border's crossing us.
The quickening pace of desertification is no joke.
This mght turn into a sticky situation.
We are running from a sticky situation.
Next time we play, honey, please just volunteer to be "it."
Honey, did you water the plants before we left?
We're Polish and Irish, where are your roots?
Well, so much for the scenic route...
Don’t complain. He promised us running water, and he delivered.
Bob, I think I've figured out what that sign meant that said, "Please don't disturb the cacti".
wow! These border patrol agents are getting really creative.
No, you're wrong... the green movement truly is extraordinary here in the desert!
We may need to upgrade our Witness Protection Program coverage.
Yeah, those mushrooms were perfectly safe.
I told you not to feed it.
Couldn't we have simply carried several canteens?
Show me your papers!
Honey, are you sure this witness protection program was such a good idea?
Hurry up honey, unless you want an acupuncture treatment with your workout!
Did you tell your Mom where we were going on our honeymoon?
"Next time try to remember, it's cacti not cactuses".
Yes, you're right .... it's peyote!
Maybe it's just thirsty
Who knew it would enjoy this so much?
Aren't mirages supposed to be enticing, and in front of you?
BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO ARIZONA. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
Don't worry, it's just a dry run.
Yikes! When they named it "The Living Desert", they sure weren't kidding!
I hate CrossFit.
It's not personal. He's trying to get his steps in.
It's either following us or we had way too much peyote.
I told you not to needle him about his dry humour.
It's just Border Patrol stepping up its efforts.
Just ignore the prick.
For a moment, I thought it was a cactus.
Pretty good border-crossing costume you got there, but you have do something about the footprints!
I think it’s trying to surrender.
You are right; the resemblance to Trump is uncanny...both are big Pricks!!
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a prick that doesn't know when to quit.
Honey, remember when I said "Get outta here you big prick" and you thought I was talking to you...
Oh great, some prick is following us!
Let's stop focusing on our form and just go fast.
Yes, dear, I know it is not keeping up with us, but that's not really the main point, is it?"
Honey, I'm just saying that it's only weird because it is leavin footprint and we are not.
We have a cereus problem
Maybe we should have waited longer before eating more of those edibles...
Run faster!! I'm pretty Saguero that he's gonna cactus!
Ever get that prickly feeling that someone is following you?
That guy has a short stride but he is a natural.
'I said you'd regret eating the worm...'
OMG, the Global Warming YETI!
Remind me, what percent water are we?
'Keep running! We're faster than he is, but he won't have to stop for water."
Not even a hug?
Jeez, who knew he would be so protective of that little peyote?
ARE YOU CRAZY !!!! A THREE-WAY IS OUT OF THE QUESTION !!!
We’re not the only ones who resolved to get more exercise this year.
Tell me if you need water
It says its not armed
I thought you said what happens in Oaxaca stays in Oaxaca.
But sweetie, when you said stick’em up, he did!
Honey, don't look now, but your prickly past is catching up with us.
Hurry up, it’s cactusing up with us.
What did you say to it?
It wants your water bottle !!
I am never running another "adventure" marathon again.
Let's name him Spike
You're the one who said I needed to find us a cheaper personal trainer.
You shouldn't have needled him. He's prickly about his weight.
He’s built for speed, not for comfort.
Wait! I think he just wants a hug.
Pump your arms — it’ll look more natural.
I think we should stop doing our jog in Area 51.
I think you gave it too much water.
I don’t trust him. He looks a bit rootless.
Prick up the pace.
Yep, he's still trying to stick to us.
But his gesture suggests he means us no harm!
I wish we had just bought Fitbits.
Do you believe in global warming NOW?
Don't you want to see the rest of my routine?
Is it really necessary for your bodyguard to wear a disguise?
Run faster & he won't cact-us!
Uh Oh! Sticker shock.
You're wearing sweatpants in the desert! Stop! Cut me open and drink some water! Touchdown! God, it's hot out here. What kind of shithole country is this?
Are saguaros carnivorous?
This new trainer is a real prick
It's almost as if it has been storing water for exactly this purpose.
You don’t suck. I said you were a succulent.
Just my imagination running away with me..
Don't move! This is a stick up.
If this is a new border wall patrol tactic, it's working!
There's been a spike in crime in this neighborhood. I found a dirty needle last week and I'm pretty sure this prick is following us.
At least its not running for congress
What does this prick want from us?
No fair-you have to count to ten first.
He's less of a slasher and more of a prick.
This brings new meaning to the word ‘Stalker’...
Honey, we're being followed by some prick.
If only I had known this is what the climatologists meant when they said, "some plants will expand their ranges in a warmer world."
Do you think he's just trying to needle us?
When the wall gets built, we can stop worrying about all this undercover surveillance.
I told you we should stay away from the old nuclear test site.
The border control vigilantes are not fooling around.
I warned you not to water it Bill.
Mother Nature's definitely on the run.
I think someone else is thirsty.
Looks like Jerry's coming down with a bad case of prickly heat again...
Hey, he didn't get funding for the fence but this moving cactus is impressive.
Hurry. I only wanted a selfie. I didn't want to adopt him. Hurry.
Wait!! I'll bloom in a few months!
Hmm, maybe I should reconsider my position on climate change
All right, we're leaving. No need to get all prickly about it.
His base may be soft, but he’s spiking in the polls!
But all it wants is a hug!
He'd go faster if he used his "arms" like we do.
If that big cactus catches up with us, we'll be stuck with him!
Wait--I think he's in pain! Hand me your tweezers.
Last one in is a rotten monotypic genus Carnegiea!
Is this just a dry run?
But we're so green! We're not leaving even actual footprints!
Well, honey, now we know "who cares" if you step on the cryptobiotic soil.
Huh. I always thought it was the fern that would be clingy.
I'm not sure I like these new fitness trackers...
Where did you pour out your energy drink?
It's scary - even in this heat he never sweats!
I know he's a prick, but we can't desert him.
I was hoping the whole 'women being chased by little pricks thing' would end in 2017.
Remember that energy drink you poured out?
Who made that mushroom pizza?
I think it wants to give up.
Leave him in the desert, you said He’d be better of wild, you said.
...AND, he just called us a prickly pair!
It doesn't want to be deserted.
Did that cactus just say... Don't shoot.?
The acupuncture did wonders for his spine condition.
Honey, did you leave a tip at that last rest stop?
Oh, I see what you mean about getting stuck out here.
If you raise your arms, it's easier to breathe.
Saguaro, smaguaro; who cares. Just hurry, he's catching up.
Remind me to shave my underarms when we're done jogging!
You can have the first hug.
First it was the polar bears, now these guys are heading to more hospitable climes.
I told you the wall wouldn't keep out those catixicans.
It’s not you, it’s all the pricks around you.
This acid trip is getting more succulent by the minute!
This won't happen once Trump gets his wall.
Remind me why peyote Gatorade was a good idea?
Honey watch out- it's an Attacktus!
Honey-I think he is surrendering!
Well, you did ask the genie for running water.
Don't forget to hydrate!
I think the runner's high is kicking in
This could turn into a prickly situation
Come on, slow poke.
Feels like we're running in place.
Honey, remember that baby cactus you had in college?
Slow down, you know the story of the cactus and the hair, don't you?
I've noticed more cactus creep from Mexico since The Wall was announced.
Not a bad pace for a Succulent...
Eventually the Saguaro-Gumby hybrid experiment went horribly wrong.
Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate!
Once we pass through that nudist camp ahead, we'll be okay.
The mirage is gaining on us!
Who paid for the wall?
I can skip the water stop.
Where's the nearest Taco Bell? I'm applying to be their mascot.
So this is what the border wall has come to?
Arizona will stay with you forever
All I want is a hug.
Actually, I'm less afraid of walking cacti than I am of driverless cars.
You give it a hug and I'll run away and get help .
I told you we would have been better off with a border wall.
I am thinking that maybe I shouldn't have eaten that button off the cactus.
. Let's hope our mirage has to pee soon.
RUN! I think it came from a shit hole!
I think it just wants a hug.
No matter which way you look at it, it follows you.
It's sticking right with us.
It looks too intelligent to be human.
I warned you to stop staring at it.
OK, you can jog with us if you can keep up.
Why can't you be normal and carry a canteen to hike in the desert?
It really does thrive on neglect.
Hey, wait up...please don’t desert me.
No,... I don't want to try acupuncture!
Keep up or you'll never lose that water weight.
Adding mezcal to our canteens for local flavor might've been a mistake...
Forget it -- the last time I let you run along side me it felt like I was having acupuncture.
Looks like we can't run away from this prickly situation.
And you complained about chafing while running?
You're it!
Darn it, I told you not to pee on that cactus.
Honey, I'm getting a prickly sensation that someone is following us.
Anything can be a dildo if you're brave enough
You can stop running. It just signaled a touchdown.
Pace yourself, our friend behind us can go a long way without hydrating.
I was told that this personal trainer may seem rough on the outside but soft on the inside.
Just ignore it, Martha. It's nothing but another attention-seeking prick.
oh come on, just one hug
Can we keep him?
You dumped me for a jogger?
This wouldn’t have happened … if he built that wall!
Looking sharp man
Apparently the wall wasn't approved.
Wait up guys, I got a thorn in my shoe.
What test site was it again we were jogging past?
Don't panic, but we're in a bit of a prickly situation...
These new border guards are real pricks.
I know you drank a cup of water last month, but staying hydrated is important.
And Lot's wife turned into a stone for The Wall
I don't think we're in Jersey Anymore
Quick, he is hot on our trail....well, at least its' a dry heat
A local cactus chases founders of Albuquerque's Annual Mezcal Festival out of town.
So much for the wall...
I guess Mexico responded to the Wall.
I told you not to use so much Miracle Gro!
Actually, I think we’re about to feel even more alive.
Here they come again! Cactus if you can!
In case one of us doesn't make it, we need to decide right now which social media site this goes on.
I tried to tell you that the national parks were closed and that not ALL security personnel had been furloughed!
For such a prick, he's so friendly.
Probably just an ICE agent in disguise.
That’s Gumby. He got tired of being stopped for autographs.
I guess not all of the locals like snowbirds.
Oh my God, I think he needs a hug!
He pricked up at the word water
No, I don’t think those raised arms don’t mean he’s surrendered!
They are taking back New Mexico!
Ah man, I could really use a hug...
It's obviously been taken in by the global warming conspiracy.
These fitness apps keep coming up with more creative ways of keeping you active!
Come on I just want a hug!
Run faster, it's cactusing up.
These mirages are getting stranger and stranger.
I think ICE is following us.
I think this prick is following us.
Running with him is nice, but then he tries to jump in my lap and lick me.
Honey, I think your ex-wife is following us again.
This could be a really sticky situation.
I suppose a "zombie" apocalypse would've been too cliche.
#METOO
Please, you won’t even know I’m there.
This sucs.
How will this end? I'm on pins and needles!
Damn immigrants.
This new personal trainer is a little prickly.
I thought you said it was safe to hike in Area 51.
Slow down, he gets prickly if we leave him behind.
Don't worry, it's just water weight.
I think it can smell your water bottle.
Next time lets just carry our own water bottles.
What was it Satchel Paige said about looking back?
Looks like global warming is gaining on us...
Won’t it be exciting if we become a legend?
Speed up. We're being followed by a prick pocket.
Remember that prickly feeing you mentioned on the back of your neck?
Don’t forget to work your arms, too.
I told you not to give it some of our water
If you keep this up, you'll lose all of your water weight!
Uh Oh, it's the new sheriff, Joe Saguaro.
Who wants a hug?
Whatever you do, don't look back; remember what happened to Lot's wife?!
Talk about carbon footprints...
It's a little prickly, but easier than carrying around a water bottle.
I told Mitch to stay hydrated.
Please don't stop short.
Esta seguro?... No, saguaro.
Make the desert great again.
Oh fuck.
I told you to quit needling him, Larry!
I said cactus, not catch us!
We're in a prickly situation.
If you only drank more water you could keep up.
Carlos, I think I may be dehydrated.
OK, I really need some water now
It's pricking up speed!!
Honey, ever wonder if you're too motivational as a personal trainer?
We told you we don't want to smell your armpits! Now leave us alone.
Caroline was ashamed. She was scared, but more than just a little turned on, too.
You were more convincing as a tumbleweed, Roger
Free hugs, free hugs, why doesn't anybody want a free hug?
Sometimes a saguaro is just a saguaro.
Some prick is following us.
Yeech! Some prick is following me.
Run! He’s actually going to build that crazy wall!!
Where's a botanist when you need one?
Let’s make tracks.
How can we turn this cartoon into a Trump bashing? That's what the New Yorker thrives upon!"
do you think we're jogging too slowly?
I think that signal means he's giving up. Run for it
Please, wait up. . .I just need a hug!
We're just not huggers.
Uh, oh. Those New Yorker cartoonists have crossed over into complete idiocy!
Haha you can’t cact us!
Stop! Don't desert me!
Dammit! Gumby’s gaining on us.
You'll be fine. We won't be long.
Oh no, the macarena is making a comeback.
Honey, have you been feeding the cactus again?
Who would have thought he'd be the spineless one?
Where's my hug?
When they said motivated runners only, I wondered why we had to fill out a waiver.
We don't have any water!
Peyote. It's not just for breakfast anymore.
Maybe we should slow down? After all, it's 150 years old.
Have you been talking to Alexa about the President again?
It looks like he is going to stick it to us!
He gets prickly when he falls behind.
They’re impossible to kill.
He's asking us to look past the thorns and see a lonely heart crying out.
Quit complaining, it was your idea to wear the cactus costume.
If that thing decides this is a conga line, Bill, I'll be moving to the front of the line.
We may have to pick up our pace.
He thinks we know where to find water.
It’s the newest border security.
He thinks following us puts him on the path to citizenship.
Yes, it’s true. Back in Washington they’re on the inside.
Run faster. He’s doing a victory dance.
He’s about to cactus.
The most important thing is to stay hydrated.
Don’t worry, after Spring Break this place will be a desert.
Your after shave is attracting the saguaros again!
I get this prickly feeling we're being followed.
Tequila catches up with you eventually.
I told you we need a wall!
Crossfitters really are insufferable.
I told you we shouldn't have taken her babies.
Wait! He's trying to tell us something.
Excuse me, which way is Mexico?? I heard something about a wall and a prick. I mean prickly, prickly.
Cactophobic city people.
You know you mentioned prickly heat earlier...
Honey, even the cacti are moving north!
Now do you believe in the creeping desert?
I'm sorry, but I don't want a hug.
Try swinging your arms, you’ll get a better stride rate.
Oh no, it's that prick!
Get it? You put the ‘us’ in cact...oh, never mind.
I told you we shouldn't have watered that thing!
O' honey - he looks just like you did on our honeymoon.
I think climate change is making it too hot for him here.
Let's drop a water bottle
Sheesh! Running makes Jen so prickly!
saguaro you
Throw him your Perrier; he'll leave us alone.
Will it catch us?" "Actually, it's pronounced catch-i.
Don't mind him. He's a prick.
I think that he is trying to tell us that the field goal is good.
Did I leave the vibrator running?
Yes, I know there are no Saguaros in New Mexico. But this one has been following us since we left Tuscon!
Rick, I think I'm ready to lead!
This cactus is a real prick
Saguaro aren't typically considered a sentinel species, Bob, I know.
Quick, a giant prick is chasing us.
I think we picked up a stalker
Run!! It's the fabled 'Needy Cactus of Laredo'.
These dry runs can take on a life of their own.
Quick! He's going to cactus.
He’s definitely sticking with us.
I told you he’d be prickly if we lapped him.
He's easier upkeep than a dog, and he doesn't get thirsty.
I thought that Trump's wall to keep aliens out would include Area 51!
Hmmm? I give up. What IS big and green and looks like a cactus and is following us?
How he gets through a 25K without drinking any water is beyond me.
We're about to be in a sticky situation.
Nobody thinks you're fat. We just thought you could use some fresh air.
Don't desert me!
Well, it seems to be interested. Should we slow down?
Uh, Bob, I think this new fitness class was a mistake.
I told you not to take a leak on the cactus that coughed.
Sheriff Arpaio, we're joggers, not Mexicans.
Saguaro, passing on the right.
We have run 10 miles, it is not a mirage.
Did you forget to water the cactus?
We need to beat him to the water stop.
Hey, come back. You have to pay for a selfie.
Honey, when you said our desert run "might get prickly," you weren't talking about leg pain were you?
We can't go anywhere without your mother following us.
Pick up the pace, its about to lap us again!
Dry humor?
Some prick is stalking us!
I think it's one of those prototypes for The Wall.
Have you been talking dirty to the plants again?
We're being stalked.
I told you your brother always gets a bit prickly when we go camping
Touchdown!
Move over, honey. The Witness Protection Running Club is coming through.
Betcha can't cactus!
Jose, the Border Patrol check-point is directly ahead ... Try not to draw attention to yourself.
You can pick up the pace if you pump your arms a little.
This guy is a prick.
It's not tip-toeing and that's no tulip!
Eric, I think we scored a touchdown.
If he follows us home, I'm keeping him.
In the desert, the scenery never seems to change.
I think he's saying he wants a fit-bit
If I'm suddenly thinking "sex toy" does that make me some kind of a masochist?
C'mon It's only the Macarena
Wait, don't desert me!
No! Stop! How may times... not "catch us." CACTUS. Just CACTUS!!
I TOLD you that you need to keep hydrated!
I think we need to pick up the pace.
I thought we left him in the dust.
Thank God, I think he's finally giving up.
Hugs! Hugs!
We will be ok! Its one of the few things that cant get over the border wall.
I wonder if it sees with it's cact-eyes
You know that stuff you read about talking to plants.....have....have you ever tried it?
Keep up or shut up.
Stop mansplaining, the thing is following us!
I knew when I ate that dessert it would catch up to me someday.
Oh, you just HAD to go and find out why they're called succulents?
Who're you callin' a prick?!
I thought I was parched
Another one got over the wall!
I don't know, I'm leaning toward posting this on Instagram. Are you still thinking Facebook?
LOOK. A CREEPING CACTUS.
It has the same New Year's resolution
If the saguaro follows us home, is it legal to keep it?
Hey, hey, just kidding! You're such a prickly pair.
He can run but he can't hide.
Are you part of the peyote ceremony?
You'd think a Presidential pardon would have made him less prickly.
Ditch the Pellegrino!
SOLLY, IT'S NOT HALLOWEEN AND YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF US.
Why is this prick still following us?
Okay, no more peyote in the smoothies for a while..
I think we scored a touchdown!
Remember not to hug him if he wins the race.
Pick-up the pace, Frank! This prick's gaining on us.
It's all about mobile these days.
Nice kick, Harry -- the field goal was good.
Border patrol alert.
Just don't ask for a hug.
Honey...I think we have a prickly situation on our hands.
I told you we should have stayed on the jogging path.
I thought we deserted him.
No it's not 5 degrees hotter, the President says so.
Ever had a bad trip on a runners’ high?
Darn I just remembered I had an acupuncture appointment today
Bob, remember that saguaro you peed on ...?
Big pricks, little pricks, seen one cactus you've seen them all.
Don't pay any attention..it's my brother's attempt at dry humor.
Disculpe. ¿Has visto a mis hijos? (Excuse me. Have you seen my children?)
Just keep moving and maybe it will lose interest.
What, no group hug?
I don't think it waving at us, I think its hungry.
Ya' still following, so move your cact' ass...
I told you not to feed it. It's the cat story all over again.
Remember, stay hydrated.
Uh, Peter—Our cactus definitely needs more work on the “Stay” command.
That's it. This is the last time I take peyote with you.
It said it wants a hug. Run!
The brochure said, "Come commune with nature.", but really!
FASTER HERALD , I THINK HE COULD BE CAPABLE OF GROPING !!
It's too fast to be a Saguaro.
My mind tells me it's a mirage, but let's keep running just in case!
Come back here! I'm really very cuddly.
When you said you brought the water what exactly did you mean?
And when I looked back, there was only ONE set of footprints...
Wanna play tag? Cact-us if you can.
Did we just pass Area 51?
Honey, why is that prick still following us?
Don't look now, but the guy behind us is a stickler for form.
C’mon...I’m not the prick everyone says I am!!
This might be the hallucinations talking, but I think we're being followed.
I heard this is how you get in shape for Coachella
No one wants to hang with a prick!
I think those mushrooms we ate are starting to kick in
John, did you forget to water the cactus?
Better hurry, he seems kinda prickly.
My next resolution for 2018 is no more Tequila.
As as desolate and life-less as it may seem, dear, I can assure you, the desert teams with life.
Honey, I have another follower. Now I have like 400 followers.
Genetically Modified Boarder Patrol
I told you, you shouldn't have peed on that!
He's gaining on us, but I bet his thighs are really chafed.
Perhaps we shouldn't run. He could be one of those Mardi Gras people who wants help out of his party suit.
No hugs? How about a handshake, then?
I don't know, has it kicked in for you?
He's not chasing us, he's surrendering. Look at his hands.
You tell him we're not taking him home.
Don’t be a prick! Wait for me!
We're a mirage...see,no footprints ?
Don't look now, but I think the costume contest has a winner!
Wait! Wait! I have fresh water for you!
Remember when you asked about mirages?
should we call Border patrol?
Wow, I didn't think peyote worked that fast!
You can keep your free hugs.
It's still there! I told you we shouldn't have eaten those mushrooms!
I know he just went through a breakup, but did you really have to offer a hug?
How close are we to the border?
I don't like these jogs in the dessert as much since that last nuclear reactor accident.
But if we keep him, where will he sleep?
Saguaro you running from?
Say Aloe to my little friend!
100 Years? How long does it take them to grow legs?
The new guy manages to stay pretty well hydrated.
Quick, get a pot!
This race needs more water stations.
Wait, stop running.....just lay down and play dead. This is a Brown Cactus.
I just need a hug!
It's not "cheering" for us honey!
We don't know where the water is either.
Not to worry, Carnegiea gigantea are much slower than Pachycereus marginatus.
I'm not a prick, I promise.
Slow down! He gets mighty prickly if we get too far ahead of him.
I'm sure it'll pass us at the first water stop.
Make a note. We're not signing up for the Peyote Fun Run next year.
He says he just wants a hug.
Run. It thinks your Ryan Zinke.
Keep running, that peyote we ate had a friend.
Species: Cactus Catchus
Who're you callin' a prick?!
Dehydration was only the secondary danger of the Ultra Desert 100k run...
I know we're in the desert & you're telling me it's a mirage, but I swear that cactus is following us!
We're not in Kansas anymore, honey.
“Don’t worry, he’s just a big prick”.

Something tells me we're not in Kansas anymore.
Ah...Honey did you say Cactus or Catch us?
A good waxing and your love life is bound to improve.
Hi, y'all!
honey , I think I spotted a deserter on the run
I guess John forgot to hydrate.
Saguaro ya from?
You really shouldn't have relieved yourself by that cactus!
We can tell our friends that we spotted Big Foot in Arizona.
See...I told you jogging was for pricks.
I thought 'Cactus Jack' was a myth.
Do you get the feeling that we’re getting nowhere?
I guess it's catch as cactus can...
Did you say your trainer was a transplant?
He always brings up thorny issues.
I'm sorry I called you prickly.
Uh, was Gumby by any chance a ten-foot tall cactus?
I’m saguaro for what I said, I’m not a prick.
Are you sure it's a mirage?
Who knew the Siguaro were so sensitive about their name? I told you the "g" was silent!
Strange. I've never seen a two legged cactus before.
Who's a good boy?
I still think it’s a mirage
Tequilla!
I'm keeping a cacti on you, mister!
Don't forget to stay hydrated!
Joshua Tree sucks...
Our new fitness instructor is a prick.
You're such a prick.
You think this is bad? I gave birth to you.
No fair. It doesn't need to hydrate
FASTER !
I'm not sticking around to find out
I don't find barefoot runners as impressive as I used to.
Cacti just tag along?
Remember that Twitter account Cactus you unfollowed ? It's following us.
It's such a close race... let's call it a cac-tie.
We did move to the desert to get away from pricks.
Slow down guys, I'm feeling a little dehydrated.
Dammit, Niles. You had to go and tame the cactus...
So when it is sentient, is it called Cactus or Cact-I ?
Well you have to branch out sometime!
No wonder the last fluid station was empty.
Well, now we have a novel answer to "how hot was it?".
Got water?
I think we're being followed.
No, I said we should do a practice race.
I thought you succulents never got thirsty during a race!
I don't care if it's native, it's creeping me out.
Please wait. I surrender.
No way am I taking him to OUR leader!
You'll never cact- us!
I have a prickly feeling we are being followed
Mr. Bezos, Tucson just won't take no for an answer.
New marathon technique; helps retain water.
Don't run away. All I want is a hug.
I think we forgot to lock the door ...
Don't look back, I think my husband is on to us.
They say it's good for the spine.
It’s a dry heat.
So that's definitely a no for Amazon in Tuscon?
Green light. Red light!
It's cact-i, not cact-us.
Looks like someone’s adrenaline spiked.
Yeah, he's improving but he's still a bit of a prick.
Who’s the prick behind us?
Why does it feel like we're not getting anywhere?
So that's why they call it the cactus "stalk"!
Do you think we're trespassing?
Honey, he says you’re spineless.
He's not that fast but we better be careful at the next water stop...
When you said yes to the question, "Will I be chased by unyieliding pricks" I thought you meant we'd be going to happy hour at Jay & Steve "pork chop" Jones' Family Sports bar& Grill.
That's the one that's 6'3" and weighs 239 pounds.
It's that prick again!
Uh oh. Arpaio is back.
I told you not to feed him trail mix; now we'll never be rid of him
John, wait up. The saguaro wants a drink.
He reminds me of someone.
He won't fit in the jeep, and he'd scare the dog. So no, you can't take him home.
Maybe we should let him pass.
So that’s why they call it Death Valley.
There must be a goal line around here. He's signaling touchdown.
Cactus today, soreguaro tomorrow.
'Hurry! It's trying to steal my moisturizer.'
A penny for your hallucinations.
Have you noticed how FOMO is everywhere these days?
Arizona really does have a water problem!
This is a prickly situation.
Try throwing your water bottle at it.
I wish it were as spineless as I feel.
This prick won't stop following us!
Wow, this "Running Scared" virtual reality exercise app is really helping us stick to our New Year's resolutions.
Do you think it’s a responding to climate change?
I am definitely dehydrated
I think he's thirsty
LET’S DO THE HOKEY POKEY.
Are you sure this race is a Boston Qualifier?
I think your brother needs some water.
Looks like we're being tailed by some tall pricks.
look at this prick
It looks like Charlie didn't hydrate enough.
Yep, still there. What a prick!
Not strange as we're jogging along a boarder. Agreed. But this is the boarder with Canada.
This could turn into a rather prickly situation
Can we keep him? He won't take any care at all and I just know he'll get along great with the gardener!
Jim, either I'm hallucinating or we've over shot our goal.
Next time we should each just carry a camelback with water.
Don’t look now but a big prick is following us!
Do you think he knows?
Global warming… the northern migration.
Remember that goofy sci-fi thriller called "The Cactus Attacked Us?"
You're it!
" I think he is signaling a right turn".
Reverse tree hugging
Can we at least speed up to a snail's pace?!
You did get the lubricant, didn't you?
Runners really DO come in all shapes and sizes!
I officially hate the person who invented Free Hug Day.
He's such a slowpoke.
We knew they were a protected species, but I guess we shouldn't have taken the saguaro cactus's photo.
Should I get my phone out and try to capture it?
Caption #600 - "I said to beam me up a Scotty" Submitted prior to 11:59 1/14 (11:37 ET) and not sure why #601 is already posted. TY.
Yes, it's a dry town. I know where you can get a drink.
Honey... I think we need to pick it up a bit...
I knew we never should’ve gone to Burning Man!
This is late, but for the contest in Jan 15 issue: "I said to beam me up a Scottie!"
That's poor runner form.
Well, this jogging in the desert idea of yours certainly has attracted a following.
Despite a perfect record in testing, Sally was still unsure whether the rape-proof jogging suit would prove to be a commercial success.
Don't let it give you a consensual hug.
Everyone seems to be doing cactusthenics these days.
He hasn't stopped at a single water station!
We should capture this thing and charge people get chased by it - I've never been more motivated to exercise in my life!
Please just tell me why I have footprints and you don’t.
I think I need to step up my jogging goals.
Go faster! I know a prick when I see one!
It’s true: desertification is advancing rapidly.
Prick up the pace.
Honey, when you said I was succulent, did you have your glasses on?
Puta Madre
darling, why is there a cactus following us?" "You remember Micheal our new bodyguard don't you sweetheart...
I'm starting to feel that prick on my back .
His friends keep deserting him.
About that feeling of being followed...
Honey, are you wearing your Cool Water cologne?
The date palm oil is working.....just 50 yards to the truck, and 20,000 smackers!
"These desert mirages sure are scary-lifelike ".
We're being stalked.
I have a prickly feeling someone is following us.
Wouldn’t a dog be better?
Don't let it needle you.
You are very prickly today!
The flora in this state are so competitive!
Hurry! I think the undercover border patrol guard is on to us!
It kind of gives me the creeps when they use me as their pacesetter.
I give up!
I just want to be friends. I'm not the prick you think I am.
If he's trying to surrender why is he still following us?
Yes, but we need to stop for water, you don't!
It seems to think we're off to see the Wizard of Albuquerque.
Looks like we've found ourselves in a prickle
I think he just needs a hug. He's worried Trump is going to deport him.
Do you ever get the feeling you're being followed?
I liked my mirage better.
I think it is a Catchtus
I don't care what you think, I'm not a plant lady!
Doris, those tequila shots are catching up with us.
Keep those hands where I can see them.
This is more of a dry run for me, ahead of the big race.
I've already told you, you're not getting my water
Honey. Did you relieve you self on a cactus before our morning run?
Saguaro you guys off to so fast?
I told you that guy at the costume party was a creep.
Don’t worry, it’s got small feet.
At this moment Jeff realizes his private investigation career may be over.
We're really only 5% water!
I think we've been jogging in the desert too long.
It's really sticking with us.
That pervert is following us again!
I just told him to speed up a little and he got all prickly. Let's bring our dog instead next time.
I think I am getting now this idea of, you know ,"global warming" ....
Jogging has become a real adventure, now that marijuana is legal.
another unfunny cartoon
Wow, it’s a giant Weinstenium species of cactus. They’re all over LA but I’ve never seen one in the wild before.
I think his weight loss is mainly water.
Desert lives matter.
I need a drink of water.
I told you not to wear your Free Hugs t-shirt!
Red light!
I heard jogging might help me lose some of this water weight.
I think it's trying to surrender to us.
I know it was an emergency, but you should've held it til came to a rest stop.
I warned you about prickly heat.
We can stop running, he's got his hands up.
Hey honey, do you someone by the name 'Spike'?
Slow down, I think he’s rooting.
You know, something about this new friend of yours just gives me pins and needles.
Hurry, Hector - I think ICE is onto us!
Apparently, the agave used for all the tequila we’ve been drinking are distant cousins of hers.
I told you it was bad karma to try the cucumber trick on the cat.
We'll try your hydration tips.
I bet it is chasing you. Let's split..
Want to rethink that restraint order?
But I never got hugs growing up!
Not to worry. It's just trying to escape global warming
Heel to toe! Heel to toe!
This dry run was a bad idea!
This wouldn't have happened if we had just gotten a succulent.
But the sign said no cactus harassment within park limits.
He'll stop chasing us when he gets thirsty
Don't worry, you only need to outrun the slowest cactus.
Look, honey, we just passed a nine-foot prick.
Global Warming has sure changed since I was a kid.
Hey! There is no "us" in Cacti.
You know, we have a bunch of senators and representatives who could use some spines.
Keep moving, global warming is gaining on us.
Saguaro you want?
Isn't it what's on the inside that counts?
Why so prickly? We're leaving!
I told you we shouldn't have fed him!
Your directions are very vague.
Yikes! The Abominable Cactus Man!
You need to lean in.
We should've stayed in New York.
And I thought taking peyote in the desert was going to be the biggest thing on my schedule today.
Run or we'll be stuck here
The vegan variation of the running of the bulls.
We'll just wait for the water station down the road, thanks.
Do you have your DSM 5 handy? I feel we’re being followed by a Cactus
We can't keep running from a bad mirage.
It's after our water.!
Who's this prick?
I hope he's not a carnivore
Are Saguaros generally so sarcastic?
I think it may be time for a water break.
I feel bad deserting it.
Hurry! Desertification is gaining on us.
Hands up. Don't shoot.
No, Ron, cactus is the singular and cacti the plural.
I may be slow but I can jog for months without water.
Go ahead! Leave me like they ALL do!
We're not that thirsty!
If we hurry it won't CACTus.
He gives the worst hugs.
So much for ditching the water bottle.
And I thought I had a thorn in my side...
All I said was 'aloe' and now it appears to be following us.
Worst California theme park ever.
you're being paranoid again.
Go faster! He's really trying to stick it to us!
I get it, Coach. We need to stay hydrated.
Don't look now, Hon, but I think we're being followed.
Faster!, I think it's arms are moving toward a hug
There was a cowboy, a construction worker...but I don't remember a cactus as part of the Village People.
Climate change must be real. He followed us to Oregon!
Your smart assistant has sent a ton of water alright...
What are you running from?. It is I, your border security.
Look, he's trying to follow in our footsteps...
Huh. Apparently, they don't run out of steam either.
It's a bit spineless for a half marathon.
I suppose we are getting our just deserts.
I think it knows we're made of water.
We know it’s you Wile E.
Watch out, it’s a succulent!
Coyote on our six.
See? I told you if we try to blend in and stay still, the wonders of nature will come to us.
He definitely could improve his times if he didn't keep his arms so stiff.
Ignore him Bob. It's attention seeking behaviour at its finest.
GLOBAL WARMING IS GETTING PRETTY BAD , WHEN A CACTUS ... IS THRISTY!!!
It hurts! It hurts!
I wish it weren't so friendly.
Ahhh, now it wants a hug!
Maybe it's just thirsty
I told you not to hug him.
Say, Spikes, pick up the pace or you'll be left behind
I know it sounds crazy, Mark ... but my spiny sense is tingling.
Between you and me, I never thought we'd have a son who would be so prickly.
He sick of waiting to be held up.
He said he just wants a little water.
Keep running! It wants to hug us!
I wouldn't say he's the cute fuzzy kind, no.
Even I didn’t think crazy Joe Arpaio would stoop this low to chase us Progressives out of Arizona before the election.
So much for the motivation myth.
Cactus see, cactus do?
Are you going to needle me about my form too?
A cactus stalk is stalking us.
I don't care if your screen name is the Tuscon Tickler, I'm not Stormy Daniels!
Stop! All I want is a hug.
This place must be a real shit hole.
Remember that baby cactus you transplanted in our garden last week?
Wait, wait take me to your leader, I've got a birth certificate and everything. It's not true that I only speak cactus. Who said that!
Don't tell me you're thirsty!
That giant prick is still chasing us.
Slow down. We're sweating too much.
You misunderstood.Look behind us.I did not call you a big prick!
What was it that guide at Yucca Flats say about changes in the flora?
You know you could run faster with if you try putting your arms down...
The guy behind us looks dehydrated.
Mr. Prickles got out of the backyard again.
If you can't keep up we are putting you back in yur pot.
Watch out! He's gaining on us!
I think we should have brought more water.
Finally! We have discovered an emotionally intelligent life-form in the universe!
That border wall won't come quickly enough.
Joe, jog faster!
Death by running cactus...tragically, Flora always knew her name would be destiny.
You remind me of my boss and I'm not the least bit interested in him either.
I'm dying for a glass of water! Your friend seems to be doing just fine though.
Honey, have you been talking too suggestively to the plants again?
I think we may have the start of a new fitness fad!
Some of these mirages come a little too close for comfort.
I know it's the latest in hydration solutions, but couldn't you just carry some water?
fred, don't look now, but i think there is a cactus following us
Sorry, we're not the hugging type.
Anyone thirsty?
What kind of stick-up is this?
But I’m telling you, it’s not my shadow!
Josh, we have a thorny problem...
Keep running. It's gaining on us.
The Desert Survival app didn't cover this.
Climate Change is truly gaining on us...
Hurry, if he follows us home, we'll have to keep him!
This trainer never gives us a water break.
"Honey, that big prick is still following us." .... (I apologize -- I couldn't help myself) ...
I think the border patrol guy needs help.
So strange, only he is leaving footprints
SNL was right Tom, Gumby is for real.
He's asking for our immigration permits.
You are retaining water..yadda, yadda....the wedding is in three months...MOVE!
Stick with me!
I knew I would regret that margarita.
He's a bit plodding, but won't need a hydration break.
I just kind of feel like we should let the local jogger lead the trail.
Hear me out, folks. I’m in a bit of a prickle...
He's stuck to us for the last mile.
What? Who says "succs running"? It is "running sucks".
Does someone need a hug?
'hurry it's going to cac-tus"
Let's put the us in Cactus.
Don't look back. We are being followed by a guy on spikes.
Something about a wall
Friday night flashback... that prick is following me home.
It's like we're running in sand.
Hey, isn't that Y.M.C.A.?
Can we talk about this witness protection program you agreed to?
I know you're feeling all prickly, but you've got to keep up.
Don’t look now. The Republican Party is short two votes.
Don't look back. We are being followed by that runner who never stops at the water stations.
- No need to keep checking on him. The doctor said he is in excellent health.
Sorry, it's Burning MAN.
Run!!! It thinks we are illegals.
It should be disqualified for illegal hydration.
'Honey, do you owe the landscaper any money?"
Looks like one of us pre-hydrated.
Please leave me alone. I said I loved the album The Joshua Tree.
" We are near the border, and that name, Saguaro, doesn't even sound English, to me.
No, we don’t want a hug.
This will work wonders for Arizona tourism.
Running makes me thorney.
When we get home, he'll look great in the front yard
Cactus Gump.
Our water supply is still with us!!.
I don't think it's signaling touchdown.
I'm not sure he's gaining on us, but he definitely looks more exasperated.
There's no "I" in cactus.
This could be, a prickly situation.
I never knew cacti were so slow.
Wait, come back, you forgot the hug!
Hands down. You are free to go.
We better not stick around or we’ll never get rid of him.
Told you to that guac wasn't right!
It picked us up at the wall.
I have a prickly feeling that someone is following us...
Honey, did you remember to bring the limes and salt?
Fine, pass me and act all superior! But did you properly hydrate?
Take me with you! Agave get outta here!
I hope he put deodorant on the inside of those thighs.
He doesn't seem to understand that no means no!
You weren't kidding when you said our new coach was a stickler!
Jogging in Arizona is sure different than in Alaska.
HAHAHAHA CACT-ASS
We are tree huggers, not cactus!
When you said, "Stick with me," you should have been more specific.
Yikes, looks like the Haitians' voodoo did a number on Trump.
I swear it just said, "Saguaro you headed?"
I get the feeling that the baby Saguaro we passed thinks we're it's parents.
Do you think it's the peyote we ate?
How far away did you say that water station was?
Why do I have this prickly feeling we are being followed....?
Honey, isn't that the new cheerleader for the Las Vegas Raiders foot ball team?
I am getting a prickly feeling
Guess it overdid the mescaline!
Follow us to your cousin Wavy at the car dealership!
Omg Ted....Your ex wife is stalking us again!
'I'm not a Botanophobe, I just think all cacti look the same...'
C'mon guys, I know I can be prickly at times...
oh shit...oh shit....shitshitshit.....fuck
Yes... the cactus is still behind us. But I can't tell if it's a boy or a girl.
New costume for illegal immigrant
Arpaio! Rápido!
Awww...I think he’s trying to follow us home.
Anyone else need a water break?
It thinks we have water...
I fear he's determined to get his hug today.
I think it smells your camel pack!
And I thought 'Goat Yoga' was strange...
Whoever heard of the abominable cactus.
Go faster, it seems to be sticking with us.
Come on, let's go... this dude's being a real prick.
Before we really get started, let's go for a dry run.
I don't think he takes many water breaks.
This is what happens when you let your kids make your costume.
We should consider running suits with the new internal hydration technology.
His dry humor was not for everyone.
I think our therapist is on Amazon again Karl.
He sure gets prickly when he falls behind.
Come on now, take me to your leader. I wanna meet the prick.
Larry, you can take off your costume now. Larry? Never mind.
I told you to drink more water.
You just had to say it didn't look that dangerous, didn't you?
It's a special suit to help you preserve water.
Hey hon! Some prick is following us!
Next time think twice about giving some of your trail mix to a cactus.
The trainer's in a prickly mood today
He's just looking for a hug.
Hey guys! Wait for me!
I think it's either the NSA or a remake of Little Shop of Horrors.
I don’t think the drugs are working.
Wait... I store water!
Honey! There's a prick following us!
If he follows us home, can we keep him?
Wait, I have a seat for each of you.
I'm sick of being a cacti. How's about a cactus?
I thought Jeff Flake wasn't running again?
This trainer is not exactly the warm and fuzzy type.
Group hug? Help put the "us" in cactus!
Area 51 security has really stepped up
I guess he won't be stopping at the runners' water stations.
Oh, I was just remembering my first date in college.
honey I believe humanities efforts to reduce the human footprint are working.
This new trainer keeps needling me!
(Singing) “Don’t fence me in...”
Just keep running dear.
I don't care what he says, I'm tired of being constantly needled by him.
Looks like everything is jumping on the jogging bandwagon
I am The Great Saguaro-holio. Are you threatening me?
This cactus is becoming a thorn in our sides.
Who knew! I didn’t think they went that fast.
Whoa hon, remember last week when that tumbleweed followed us home?
It’s not a costume. Run!
It's the return of the cacti
I said, 'I don't think this one needs a caption!'
Things sure do get lonely around here.
It's even too dry for me.
Gotta admit - that’s one tough cactus!
You can run but you can't hide
This is the best flash mob we can expect in the desert!
Alright, you're slow... but you have other good points.
Loraine's last thought seeing her husband run away was 'what a prick'.
I am sure Mexico could afford this
I think we are in a prickly situation
We don't need a reminder out here that we're rootless but alive.
He thinks we’re trying to desert him.
Damn It’s either the damn peyote or Trump ain’t doing the wall anymore.
Hurry up, it's gonna cactus!
Pick up your pace, it's going to cactus!
Help....please don't desert me!
i am having trouble reading his expression
So, this is where they hold Burning Man?
Honey, that Magic Go plant food really works!
Seriously, we can stop for water any time you want...
Border Protection will get you – they always look for plants.
He's built for running in this heat.
I think I'll call the blog post: 'I was chased by a cactus for 30 days; here's what happened.'
His runnning technique needs improvement
Margie is realizing that when you run in the desert, most of the other runners are just a bunch of pricks...
Well, I suppose we could build an atrium.
I told you visiting Los Alamos was a bad idea.
He's still sticking to us.
For the last time, you cannot have a hug!
But Jim, it says it's friendly and it only wants a hug.
Its been waiting for a dry run.
Yes it is creepy, but I suppose it’s more eco-friendly than a 30 foot tall concrete slab wall.
Who's a good alien?! Who's a good alien?!
I think Amy is a little dehydrated.
Honey? Did you piss before or after taking the Viagra?!
Talk about thigh chafing.
I swear it wants to tell us something.
If a cactus dances in the desert . . .
These roots are made for walking.
They say running is a good way to get rid of excess water retention
Let's just say he's no Usain Bolt.
It thinks we are a succulent snack.
I think he wants a high five from each of us
For no good reason, I sometimes get so paranoid ... like a cactus is following me in the desert ...
He doesn't even break into a sweat.
Shave next time. It might help with your speed.
You just had to make the spineless joke, didn't you?
How do you know a mirage when you see one?
Don't waste your time, buddy. It's just a mirage.
Instead of facing the enemy and the very thing causing us harm, we decide to take the easy way out. We run away from our problems instead of just handling those difficulties. Little do you know, it always catches up.
It is bad enough that we are being lapped by a saguaro, but does he have to laugh?
Taking that cactus's peyote was a very bad descion.
I said NO hugs!
I can't stand the smug of it not needing water and "just you wait" attitude.
Honey, I think it's just lonely.
All I wanted was a hug.
We had to visit area 51. I said a cruise but noooooo. Hurry Leon, the cactus is gaining on us.
You can’t accuse me of being the thorn in your side.
Hey....no need to be so prickly.
I knew vines creep but saguaro?
I think I prefer the Zombies app.
Hey, wait up! Stop being such pricks
Maybe they should start regulating CRISPR.
What do you think honey? Is it faster than a zombie?
He's armed!
That is quite a root system.
Is it cactus or cacti?
Don’t look now but secret service is following us!
I’m on pins and needles.
Why wont you let me carry you?! Don't you see there's only one set of footprints in the sand?
Don’t MAKE us go back to our liberal coastal city with tales of stalking and peyote!
"No, no! Mr. Huggy Cactus is a just a myth" you said.
Wait, there's more peyote!
Faster, faster – it’s showing a lot of spine.
Honey, is there such a thing as an abominable cactus?
It’s either following us, or we’re on a treadmill.
Honey....what is it this time? Little green men?
Have juice, will run!
Three miles and he still hasn't broken a sweat!
Red light, green light, 1-2-3!
I have this prickly feeling we're being followed
Your personal trainer's the prickly type
You sure you don't want any water?
Honey, you think I'm insane but that cactus is gaining on us.
There’s no reason to be afraid . . . . It’s a dry heat.
Hey, my arms are getting tired.
I don't know about you, but I think this guy's trying to make a point.
I told you! You can't go hugging every tree you see!
Doesn't he know it's just water weight?
I've heard of being in step with nature, but this is going too far!
I knew we shouldn't have jogged around Chernobyl!!!
I think that he wants to offer us some water
I said he want to prick me. What did you think I said?
Wait. I just want a hug!
Hey Freddy Look at these two. They leave no Footprints.
He is a rootless transplant - I want a Norwegian spruce!
Don't stop for water!
We're being followed
I may be paranoid, dear, but that doesn't mean something isn't out there to get us...
My mother used to tell me there was no point to running.
Cacti are sooo passé.....
You said your old girl friend was prickly. What else is there about her?
Our hallucination is catching up with us
Honey, we need to prick up the pace.
We may need to pick up our pace.
We're being followed and it looks like a prickly dildo.
OK you are right it is not a Jumping Cholla. But it is a Stalking Saguaro
Don't move until the actor walks by. The actor, looking lost, will stop and scratch his head. Give it a count of 'three' and say, 'BOO! He'll jump out of his skin and run like hell. You run after him until the director yells, 'CUT.
The beacon in the wilderness is following us!
Don’t look now, but someone else made a New Year’s resolution.
Move! I don't want to get stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.
The chafing is bad, but oy! the plantar fasciitis is murder.
I know what you said about the pleasures of being alone out here and the silence and everything, but I have the strangest feeling someone is following us.
Are you always this prickly in the morning, Amy, or is it just when you go for a run?
I think we've had enough dry land training.
Maybe we shouldn't have skipped that last water station!
I know he's in witness relocation, but he should keep a lower profile.
Pick up the pace, it's gaining on us.
Uh, Honey, is this what you meant by the new 5 point exercise motivation program?
Just give him some of your water and he will go away.
Hurry up, slowpoke.
Hypothetically, would it be cactuses or cacti?
Well, at least we won't need a water bottle.
Area 51? Yeah we're trying to find it too. Walk this way.
I told you not to wear the cactus hugger shirt!
Hey, Arizona just scored a touchdown.
I told him to hydrate!
Honey, I told you not to feed the cact. Now look what you've done.
Just because I don't have an extra energy bar doesn't mean you have to be so prickly.
It's been gaining on us ever since we stopped at the water station.
She's doing really well of leash!
Wait! Don’t desert me. I’m so saguaro...

He's prickly, but I find it motivating.
The saguaro is keeping in step with us.
Stay back you prick!

Wait, guys! It's Free Hugs Thursday.
Uh, Ted, we've got a sticky situation here.
I'm not entirely sure, but it appears to be about 239 pounds, a huge prick, and an unrelenting threat to our progress - best keep moving
Slow down Jimmy! He just wants a hug.
The saguaro is segueing.
Enough with the anthropomorphism already.
I think it's part of Trump's border wall.
I don't see eyes. It must be a scent saguaro.
We'll need to stop for hydration before he does.
I heard Tucson’s Chamber of Commerce was aggressive, but this is ridiculous!
I love it when a plan comes together.
Honey, I hate to be a stickler for details, but that nice park ranger did warn us to NOT feed the baby cacti.
This is proof that some endangered species are overprotected.
Only jogging can't help. You need to work on your water retention problem.

I understand that by 2050 they will be the dominant species!
I wonder if it can do the 'Macarena'?
This big prick keeps following us . . .
You always get so prickly when you can't keep up!
my cactus jokes are succulent
How much farther to the first water stop?
I'm trying a walking program to help with the water retention.
I urge all runners to stay hydrated, but I assume that’s not an issue for a succulent like yourself.
When Cacti Attack
That CIA guy is a thorn in my side.
That’s not the ‘Surrender to the pain’ I had in mind...
He may need water.
Jogging really does help. Look how thin he is!
Honey, I think we really need to consider going non-GMO
I now know where Frosty the Snowman lives after the New Year.
This is not a drill!!!
Actually, vertebrates are not the only creatures with spines, Professor!

I'm not prickly! I'm actually really nice! Wait up!
Quickly, before it cactus up to us!
don’t look back. I think we are being followed.
If we had a dog instead of a saguaro, he could keep up.
He must think we work for Amazon.
Unusually sticky situation!

Aren't you in my pilates class?
Wait, honey, it's just the mascot for that new tax prep service.
I think I need to stop for some water.
He wants to get out of this Hellhole as much as we do.
It’s not hydrating.

hey wait up guys
He will pass us at the oasis.
Cactus, Catch us.
Go faster, we seem to have a thorny problem
Keep up, Joshua.
I think we've upset the native.
Keep running. This IS it's territory.
More than just an inconvenient truth, I’d say.
What if it follows us all the way home?
This diet is making me delusional.
She's a little prickly, but she's a great coach.

I think he has a stitch in his side.
Looks like there might be a big prick coming!
How many miles to the water station, did you say?
Don’t forget to hydrate ME
Free Hugs?
That’s not a typical mirage.
I'm not sure that's what they meant when they said "dress for the desert."
Run faster or we'll have to high-five it.
Al! Vera! Wait up!
Y'know... you won't be able to jog very far if you run with your arms held up like that.

Stay hydrated.
Don't look now but a cactus is following us.
Yep, number 45 was right. Here they come.
Do you think he'll cactus?
He seems a little prickly for a personal trainer.

If we cut through the oasis the water might distract it
Think he needs water?
Ned . . . are you sure your mother stayed New York?
Wait, I have a thorn in my foot.
Thanks for pointing out the way ... oh, and Maria says "hi".
One small step for a cactus, one giant leap for fleeing humans.
Greg, I got a strange question: does your ex-wife have a cactus costume?
Why does everyone run away from me? I have lots of good points...like, why I am I growing here in Alaska?

I TOLD you that jogging in the desert with no water was a bad idea!
When Sheila said that the new trainer was a little bit prickly, this isn’t what I thought she meant.
She got prickly when I told her you were already married
The rumors were true. He thought the wall idea had gotten old. They’re all along the border.
Say, where-o we running?
I think Ken has been juicing greens a little too much.
Our prickly friend never gives up!
Has it gotten too much rain?
I think your wife is still suspicious.
Well, I guess Arizona made it to the Super Bowl.
I knew about the jumping cactus... I guess there are jogging cacti too!
Wow, Ben, even the cacti in this state move with more spine and speed then Congress!
Beware: When you least expect it, Joe Arpaio will catch up with you!
It thinks you're Tom Hanks.
Just tell him that this is not the traveling company for "Lost Horizon".
Remember throwing away the giant cactus your mother gave us?
Let it pass, but don't touch.
No, no! You put your right foot in before you take it out!
(Whispering) “We’re being followed.”
I think he wants his peyote back...
Told you that running was addictive.
Keep going! Needles isn't too far away.
Your ex-wife’s camouflage technique is really getting better.
This guy is starting to stick too close to me.
I'd never walk a mile in its shoes!
Honey, we have a succulant on our tail.
You had one job Saguaro, count to one hundred...
I told you someone was following us...
Hurry, the big thorny dildo is getting closer!
Honey, feel like making some tequila after our run?
He seems friendly enough, but his hugs could be troubling.
Shadowed by a saguaro.
We should have stopped for water!!
Remind me to skip the peyote entree next time.
When is the next water station?
Which watering can did you use?
Just relax honey; he's not trying to prick me.
Run, it’s alive and he’s horny
I didn't know running had side effects!
Surrender is not in his vocabulary.
If you think this is tough, wait till you compete in the pole vault!
Run for it! The peyote around here really kicks butt!
Not yet, Rocky. Not yet.
Hey, slow down. I am about five times your age!
How do you think it stays hydrated?
Sorry to bring up a thorny topic.....
There's nothing big and beautiful about this
Please keep me, have you never heard of Imprinting ?
Honey, I think we should head for the Natural History Museum.
Hey guys, don’t desert me. I can’t stand the heat!
We have to move faster, big foot is gaining on us.
Come back, come back ... I'm not that prickly ... !
Are you an ICE robot?
Hurry! Yond cactus has a lean and hungry look!
I think he's giving up. He can't keep up with us.
What a slowpoke.
We invited him in, but he hasn't taken off his fur coat.
I think it's signaling us to slow down!
Outsourcing border control is no shithole!
Maybe laser tag would be better
Cactus can't catch us
I suppose he's gonna want a hug when this race is over.
You're absolutely right. If it had plug, it would look exactly like one of those.
I knew I should have had the full treatment at the spa.
he' He's not getting any too dehydrated.
Debby, the cactus is not chasing us... lay off the sleeping pills!
It appears we are in a prickle
Don't you just love the miracles of nature?
Honey, the cactus is following us, I saguaro.
I think we got competition for the oasis...
I've heard of quicksand but never a quick saguaro.
You might want to speed it up but whatever, just don’t sweat!
Fastest cactus in the west. Every year it's one full step!
Run! It's the Abominable Cactus!
I understand it's called a catchus plant.
Well, they do say that a spike in activity can help with fitness.
We know where to turn for water.
I don't mean to put a thorn in our jog, but I think that cactus is following us.
We've run into some sticky stuff!
Well I think it's a female and she wants to hug you.
Don't look now, but I think we're being followed.
He won't be a slowpoke once we're through with him!
C'mon! You're going to have to do better than that to qualify for this year's triathlon.
I know we landed in the US, but are you sure we got their leader?
That Saguaro 5k run event set up team sure makes this race course feel real, eh?
Now, you would to amenable to a wall.
I'm really not prickly once you get to know me.
The cactus loaded up on carbs and began chasing us.
Why did you keep bragging about your new razor?
Some runners are awfully prickly.
No its not that kind of prick.
Look honey. He's feeing California too! Do you think he watches Fox News?
And here I was thinking that my heat rash was just Prickly Heat.
Hurry, I think he may cactus to us!
Hurry, I think it's gaining on us.
I'm so pokey - I'm always behind.
You'll see. The Cactus Companion will be bigger than Bitcoin.
I think it's cheering us on !
Hey the North Korean missiles could hurt me too.
But he is not wearing a trench coat
Quick, find a haystack!
Do cone-heads dress up for Halloween?
Another couple of steps and it'll be a dry heat.
What did you say the name of this 5K race is?
Why is it doing the Texas 2 step while chasing us?
It's doing the hokey pokey, shaking it all about.
I think it's completely misunderstood "#MeToo."
We're being Saguaro'd.
At least it isn't as fast as the mummy
Nature dramatic about global warming much.
Pick up the pace, hon...the saguaro is looking top-heavy.
Really? I thought he was one of your friends.
The cacti and succulents trend has feet!
Actually, the green community is a huge supporter of the 'leave only footprints' policy.
He'll get a bit prickly if he keeps lagging behind.
Looks like Spike is keeping us at a steady pace!
That one just swaoroed at me!
It's another illegal fleeing his dirthole country.
First time I've ever had the jitters and I just need a hug.
Where can I catch the last train to Yuma?
I told you we should have brought our water bottles, then we could have gotten this prickly dude off our backs.
Either the heat is getting to me or that cactus is catching up.
Honey, did you bring any tweezers?
You took a wrong turn somewhere. The Sonoran Desert is in the other direction.
They should call this the Pacing Desert.
Her weaknesses as a runner she more than makes up for with true veganism.
Ignore him. He'll stop when we get to the parking lot.
I'd sleep with you but the condom is not going to work
Think he needs water?
Honey...is there a desert Sasquatch?
HE SAYS HE IS TRAINING FOR THE MARATHON
When did cacti get into tai chi?
The good news is,once we ditch him we can follow his tracks back to civilization.
Hmmm. Amazon must've said no to Tucson. Look who's back.
Yes, I know you've been lonely
It says Area 51's gym gets overcrowded every January.
Gush! This is a truly lonely planet!
Yeah, they "come in peace" - 'til you're pinned under one, dead!
Run, it's a tequila monster!
It needs to have it's stickers removed.
Don’t look now, but we’re about to get lapped!
I got him a spandex jogging suit but he has trouble getting it on.
He said climate change is for real. Even cactuses are dying of thirst. He wants us to take him to a bar so he can have a glass of beer.
Stop! Come back! I know it's bad here, but once we get that wall built....
Bill, are you wearing that AQUA cologne?
Wait a minute. You're 60% water.
My kind is from north of the border, promise.
I think it's finally kicking in.
I just felt like running...
Hey. Wait for me. I need a little rainwater too.
Oh, look! I think he wants to follow us home.
We're being lapped.
Beam down, Spotty, where no dog has gone before.
Abduction, you idiot! Not labduction.
"This species is telepathic....I'm getting something about trajectory of a small fuzzy sphere." (This caption intended for the D. Panckeri cartoon. I think I have until 11:59 P.M. E.T. tonight to submit.)
According to relativity, his owner will age 7 years for every one of his
He was wondering if we could fetch him a squirrel.
I would just beam him on up, Scottie
He’ll only go outside.
Fear of the Walking Cactus
Don't look it in the eyes Martha!
Come on guys, don't leave me hangin', never leave anyone hangin'
"So that's how you keep your cactus so healthy-looking!'
Coming soon to a theater near you: Kinky Kactus Killers. A Donald J. Trump Production.
A trans-plant is scary enough. Let's hope they never encounter a transgender.
My ex gets a LITTLE prickly with George around...
And you join us here at the 'Desert Run' where Cactus Jim is not happy with the way Mr & Mrs Jones overtook him." "Yes Bob he certainly 'has the needle' over something!
Don't blame this on global warming, too.
Our trainer is so "picky ".
You'll die in this shithole!
i said we should'a brought water.
Thank God! Jogging partners keep me honest.
A sujaro picaro!
I've seen walking mangroves but this is weird for a cactus
Do you know anyone named 'Cactuseae'?
Climate change is really getting out of hand.
Did the running map show a lot of sharp turns?
Just keep moving, and smile a lot.
A cactus costume is still stalking.
Let me know when you're ready to stop for running water.
Is this part of your app?
Hon, you won't believe this! It's a jogging Joshua tree!
Harold had resolved to start running again, but still worried his fear of hugs was holding him back.
I am sure it is terribly lonely living all alone in a big desert, but that cactus is just trying way too hard.
Don't worry. Its just another disguised celebrity hypocrit trying to escape Hollywood after those Gawdawful Golden Globe Awards.
Arpaio is onto us
Zigzagging hasn't worked any better than trying to find a place to hide.
Howard, either a thorny ICBM or a touchdown cactus is following us.
The new cartel mission of "Hugs Not Drugs" is not winning the hearts and minds they expected.
We're being followed by a succulent. Can we keep it?
This service dog claims he can guide the master vessel
Cactus tag? That’s ridiculous.
He’ll be sensational, Phineas!
I hope this is not considered saguaro theft!
It's Toni Erdmann!
I think if we keep him jogging he'll drink less.
There is no cause for alarm- an earlier alert of imminent cactal impact were a result of employee error.
Global Warm-Up on Global Warning
Bob, I know your mother-in-law is a stickler for morning jogs - but THIS is ridiculous!!
This cactus has feet!
Our new trainer is kind of a prick.
Don't look back. If we keep moving it can't catc us
I told you he was a prick.
Tomorrow sneaking up on me like...
I guess it's trying to sweat out some of its excess water.
Sorry - "Cactus" not "Cacti". Do you really need to nitpick?
Honey. Did you leave less than 20% again?
Gotta run now...poke ya back later!
It's been a thorn in my side since we began.
I think there is a crack in the wall.
No need to be rude about it.
Beam me down, but just not one of those shithole countries.
It lacks a human element.
The damn thing must be thirsty.
Relax. Either he's a mirage or I am.
If we just take to the air, I think we'll be fine.
Honey, it's gaining on us!
And this is why we don't throw the ball out the window, Jeff.
I know you like running in the desert but I feel like it gets us into some prickly situations...
Take me to your Leader !
Cactaceae is just the genotype. He identifies as a marathon guy
Ugh, tourists.
Don't panic, I was a runner bean in a past life.
Who's this prick?
xxxxxxxx
You're right. A lot of interesting individuals go to Burning Man.
I can't stop thinking of margaritas
Straighten up your spines a little more.
And I thought I had prickly heat.....
Get back across the border you thorny creature- you don't belong here in the USA.
Are you familiar with saguaro triffids?
Wherever you go, there you are.
Stop, I think it wants a hug.
Is this Gaia revenge?
- Saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), an arborescent cactus species, genus: Carnegiea, which can grow to be 40 ft tall. Native to the Sonoran Desert (AZ), the Sonora (Mex), the Whipple Mountains and the Imperial County of CA. - Well, I don’t give damn!
I told you you shouldn't urinate on the cactus. See what you get?
At least now we know where we are.
Hmm, cactus may take being peed on as a sign of endearment.
That's one needy cactus...
When did this start?
It will never cats us!
Come on Desmond, keep up.
Take me to your breeder.
Finally, on the steps of the Capitol Building, we found intelligent life.
Did you buy the generic salsa again?
Are you running the 5k for "Me Too", also?
Saguaro you waiting for?
Is it cactuses or cacti? Anyway, about 300 of them are running after us right now.
I didn't know they had golems in Arizona.
Yo check out this fuckin' cactus.
Wait for me. Don’t you want a cac-tie?
Must be a Segway-ro.
Honey, Do Endorphins talk?
I think there’s too much carbon in our footprints.
Weren’t we supposed to be getting a Republican senator?
No, cactus buttons aren't legalized!
Huh? Practical effects are a lot scarier than CGI.
Is that a Triffid?
Relax.It's only our just deserts.
Wait! I'm just shapeshifting...
I have a very dry feeling that we are being followed.
So, it's illegal to have. We'll just say it followed us home.
I told you water wasn't a concern
oh no-I've got to stop for some water!
So how long did Saguarai say we had to test this?
Boogity boogity boogity!
Hey Stan. Why don't you grow a stubble beard.
If that fuckin cactus catches up to us - He will probably attack us with his needles . . .
He’s after I!
You shouldn't have dropped the water bottle back there!
You have to ignore it. Cacti are supposed to be lonesome.
"So are you" glad to see him?
And peace be with you, too.
I said, his practice has quite a following.
Wow! Who knew?? It really IS huge!
Trump is President - I give up.
It's fine, it actually prefers to run dry.
I've hear
Don't be prick, Trevor. Stop following us!
We better hurry or this race will end with a cacti.
Jerry, have you ever thought some guys might be a cactus in a man suit?
high fives are for plants who've learned how to find a job.
Stop running, I think it wants to be friends.
I see your points about power-walking.
Wait up. I didn't mean it when I said your arms look funny.
Superb.
Are you sure this is the way to the voting booth?
John, the cactus is really improving its time. It might catch us today.
The water famine is gaining on us.
Get back here you little pricks!
Wait! Let me explain...
He looks like he's good at staying hydrated.
Hurry Harold! That prick is chasing us!
That's a pretty weird sag wagon.
Is it gaining on us?
Saguaro we off to?
I'm really into CrossFit
You can follow us if you want - we're going to the subway, too.
Honey, I think my past has finally caught up with me.
Our drinks are coming.
Remember when I told you about the walking penis with a green spike condom that was following me?
Darned snowbirds!
I just got this prickly sensation about footsteps in the sand.
Hey! Let's stick together.
Honey, don't turn around. Just think of the absolutely most unlikely thing to be chasing us through the desert. I'll give you a hint. IT'S A GIANT CACTUS! RUN!
Unbelievable. It's not even wearing a Garmin.
It's supposed to be a burpee - not an "Arrest me".
Sorry dear, you will just have to hold it.
He gets very aggressive when they throw the bottles of water.
Don't forget to stay hydrated!
And I thought we were rootless.
CBP turn prickly
Wait, did you say this was a National Park!!!!
We should have enough water for the marathon.
I don’t think you need to lose weight - it’s mostly water retention.
And you said my "Plants versus Zombies" addiction was a waste of time!
Our Water Supply Isn't Keeping Up!
Quick, he’s cactusing up to us.
I think we are being followed. This could be Cereus!
Ye whom never need to exercise and can eat whatever ye want without girthing shall know damnation.
Talk about the WILD WILD West, Pilgrim!
Amazon said no go! Know anyone headed to Tucson?
Honey, remember the seed we planted a few years ago?
I know you don't believe in global warming, but I really don't think anything can live in the desert anymore.
Wonder which planet is he from?
Cact I get you to look behind me for a moment, honey?
Let's pick up the pace, we're being trailed by sharp competition that's not even breaking a sweat
Gaining! It will have to slow down to bloom in May.
Hope those needles don't give us prickly heat.
I hope he doesn't cact us
Jared. Do you remember that Muller guy?
I told you we should have just gotten Fitbits!
You know those cactus needles stuck in our clothes, I think that he wants them back.
He too must see the shimmering lake just ahead.
Cereusly?
Our situation is about to get thorny.
no one told me it would cact us!
Once the wall is built, they will die from the shade it casts.
C'mon, Slowpoke!
Global warming changed me to this!
I heard big cactus leaves his needles in your arm and you die!
I think it's catching up.
Hurry up or we will be late for the start of the Cactus League
Honey, Have you ever read The Day of the Triffids?
Tom run run" he saids he is "our neighbor across st."Just a bad day at work" Tom" where does he work ? in the "Twilight zone ?
It's the Veg-Ness monster!
"Who's saguaro now?
The ranger is giving the "Hiking Safely in Cactus Country" talk again tonight.
I think he's looking for his sombrero.
It's following the water!
I thought this missions trip was with a rabbi
Desert Gone Wild
Run Desert Run
“Wait. . . I said this heat’s a killer. . . the HEAT!
I’m beginning to think the Death Valley Ultramarathon would have been a better choice.
Run! It's angry that I appropriate the Western aesthetic in order to appear trendy!
"Fact is, a cactus has tracked us," said Jack's sis.
I truly think they shouln’t have lowered the time qualifying standards for the New York marathon...”
'Ir's the desert version of a fox hunt."
It’s playing ‘follow the leader’.
Are you sure the water didn't taste funny this morning?
Honey. The cactus is falling behind again.
Times up.
Quick Charles! Its the newly discovered genus sub family!
This costume is very misleading. I really need water right now!
Beam us up? We have phasers, I say we blast it!
Good thing we've been training or I doubt we could out run it.
Now you know what it feels like.
We should have manifested a less aggressive new year resolution.
Hurry up, slowpoke.
we can't let it cactus- I mean, catch us.
Geez. All I did was ask for gas.
Honey, your mother has a new hat!
Thatta boy, stick to it!
I told you to not water it often; now it's following us
the cactus is trump
Hey Bill, do you think we'll find some water?
We're being followed
Honey, I think we are bristling up the natives...
I don’t care how rare it is, it’s gaining on us!
Don't leave...you should stick around.
Signal when you're ready for a drink so he doesn't suspect anything.
Tell him you fell for a prickly pear.
You've got to start getting at least 64 ounces a day.
I get this prickly feeling in my neck that we're being followed.
I think we're being followed but I'm not saguaro.
Yes dear, yesterday it was an "Oasis" today a "Cactus" that runs, and tomorrow?
That reminds me - I’m making your favorite- runny cactus soup - for dinner.
I think someone's beating the border wall.
I told you to wear shoes.
Okay, okay,! So a bleeping cactus is more trouble than a dog! Who knew?!
I'm at a lose for words.
What did I tell you about overhydrating?!
Don’t be so pokey.
don't forget to breathe
It's fine, you're supposed to retain water.
We're getting needled to move faster.
Beware! Stray too far from the stepping stones and you'll be 'cactus'!
..don’t look now but I think we’re being followed by the SEGUARO STALKER!”
The water station isn't until mile 2.
He's looking for the nearest Barber shop.
Remember, the key to these distance runs is keeping your fluids up.
I would hate to be raped by that guy.
Wait! Come back, I just want a hug!
It's not moving fast enough to catc us.
I have to stop the 5K to Mexico, I can't jump that.
I thought it was just going to grow tall and not adopt runners.
I read that they're crossing before the wall goes up...
And you call me prickly...
Built-in hydration? Okay, that's totally cheating!
You mean, ‘at least it’s not cactI.’
At least we know he doesn't need a leash
Why don't we just hug him honey? He seems so desperate for affection." "Dammit Martha! You should have told me that before we abandoned the car a half-mile down the road.
We've got to train a lot more. I don't want to get beat by a cactus.
There's a cactus, After us.
It's looking for revenge. Amazon said "No!"
When are you going to learn to take NO for an answer. #MeToo
I can see this is going to turn into a prickly situation
I think we’re headed toward more global warming
No really, the cactus is following us. Not fake news!
I brought you into this world!
George, that perpetual feeling of uneasiness I have is definitely associated with the cactus.
Maybe we could put him on a leash?
George's father-in-law went to the extreme to make sure nothing EVER happened to Carol.
He's tracked us.
Hey. If you can't keep up, just stay here and we'll cactus up on the way back.
Honey if we hold our arms up I'll bet we won't have to stop for a drink.
Ok, you win! Tell us why are you following us
C'mon! I can get you a great deal on a timeshare. I'll throw in free tickets to the cactus festival.
Wait, I just want to give you a hug
When I said let's run in the desert, I said let's take the Camaro, not the Saguaro.
Run, or we are cactus!
It looks like, Rudy, that we have two thumbs' up for what we're about to do.
I guess this neighborhood doesn't agree with gentrification either.
And I though this was supposed to be a peaceful weekend in the desert.
I'm getting this prickly feeling.
I think he’s thirsty too
Talk about being a prickly, I barely criticized his mother! And now he going to chase us? I told you all cacti are nuts!
That may well be, but I still insist you maintain healthy hydration practices.
I think we're being stalked by a stalk!
Cacti were also covered by DACA? Tuscon Women's March is this way... C'mon Robert.
Don't worry, he is not a gingerbread man!
Honey, we've been made. The cactus knows we're not a mirage.
Wow! You've been from Tucson to Tucumcari!
I can't help but think that I have seen that cactus before.
I didn't know the cacti also danced at the Sundance festival.
No worries honey, t's just a dry run.
George, a Saguaro is following us. Bad hombre. Need wall.
Hug-a-muga?
It makes me nervous when you feed it Gatorade.
We fetch too
Can we still call him Scottie?
Next time instead of playing tag, let’s play cards, it will be less of a prickly situation!
He's really sticking with it.
Sure, you can jog with the club after excessive rain.
Just a few more steps and we reach our goal!
They call it an M.C. Hammer cactus.
He must have imprinted on me when he was a baby!
I’m gonna hug you....lol..like really tight
Honey, the name of that cactus; is it "Saguaro" or "Seguiro"?
I think it's more prickly than creepy!
Is it following us?
Well this one could use a good shower and shave....
Suguaro, Suguaro, I love you, Suguaro...you're always a step too slow!
I stand corrected: I guess there is such a thing as a cactus whisperer.
Don't look now, but I think we're being followed. OR Can cactus walk?
Simon says, 'Hop on one foot.'
Must be looking for sander pastures.
Honey, there's a big cactus following us. Seems odd as cacti don't usually have legs.
You think this bad?? What if he gets pardoned?
Life in outer space...I was thinking...what happened to Phil?..he became a dog...
So they really are that tenacious.
It keeps pretending to cross the finish line, so why doesn't it just stop?
'We wanted the fire hydrant, not this?!
Pretty soon he’ll have to break for some dry air.
Ultra-prickly!
Dodson, you ever get the feeling you're on life's treadmill?
He must be on steroids. Look at all the needles on him.
Food for thought: next time we're chased by a cactus, instead of keeping a linear position we should turn left or right and run! Just sayin'
The touchdown cactus is gaining on us.
Sure it’s slow...but easy to keep up when you don’t need to stay hydrated”
Looks like we've got a three-stalker with us.
We don't even like tequila.
It's the only sign of intelligence I could find in that big white building down there.
Come on, it's only a hundred more steps until you reach your goal.
I think Fred is dehydrated.
How far was that nuke test site ,you say ?
That Saguaro is on the move.
I hoe you're ready if the cactus attacked us.
I wish that prick would stop following us.
I have a prickly feeling on the back of my neck.
No, this trainer never gets dehydrated. He's always this prickly.
Do cacti reproduce from runners?
He's going to Dune-sinane
Looks like he might be starting to cha cha.
Either we scored a touchdown or he thinks it's a holdup. Either way it's a prickly situation.
Could it be Climate Evolution?
Amy's gone too far with the trendy water bottles this time.....
Weren’t you going to beam me up a Scotty?
I told you we shouldn't have worn sweatpants and long sleeves in this hotass desert!
But we just got you back in!
Been awhile since the last water station.
Don't mind me, I'm just a little prickly today.
YAAHHH, you told me they could only moonwalk!!
Could it feel more deserted?
We need to pick up the pace.
OK, but if you are going to answer the call of nature when we run, you really need to think about how much those steroids affect the environment.
Try not to sweat.
Wait wait don’t tell me!
Aerodynamically speaking, jogging is the wrong sport for me.
So if you can't keep up, you can always tag along with the tumbleweeds.
You know it’s going to lap you.
But you’re the one the want to us to make new friends!
Yes we'll die, but it'll be a dry death.
Tom, your a botanist. Can a cactus be proactive?
He's got all that water and he wants to be supportive.
Honey, does running with your arms up cause prickly heat?
Don't look back, you'll turn into a little cactus.
Cactus follower
colin stokes please help me im stiuck in my attic with my rigjht hand pinned under my heavy limted edition r2d2 replica that fell this is a last dich cry for help and 911 is ignoring me becaus of various past incidents please se;nd somebody
The cactus has an advantage here, even though he is behind, it doesn't need any water.
...and I'm the prickly one? Sorry, but you know, sometimes a saguaro, is just a saguaro.
if its a race my moneys on it
I've heard of jumping cactus before, but you're not going to believe this.
All I said is "I think the flat earthers are making some interesting points about the sun and the horizon." Why are you running away??
You can make, only 99 miles to go.
I'm sure the Wall will stop this!
Sure, it could be a mirage, but I don't want to take that chance. Do you?
Cactus can't catch us
You might keep up if you tucked you swung your arms lower
Don't run. I surrender.
Run, run, run as fast as you can You'll not escape saguaro man. (note: it scans)
The cactus is trying the catch us.
Saguaro you going?
Remember how you told me about that new variety of cactus, the Walking Stalker?
Run Desert Run
At first I felt jealous that she got so slim, but I think it was just water weight.
Sowhoarya ?
seriously, leave him and come dance with me
Sorry, but we didn’t bring any water this time!
we got another cactus in our sweatstream
Wait, let's ask this cactguy that used to be Bob if he has water.
Keep going! You have to stick to it.
So what if I have a prickly personality...I could still use a hug?
Steely Dan...nuclear missiles...maybe picking up the pace. And you?
He's a lab. We said, Beam me up a Scotty."
And it has it hands in the air.
I think we may have detoured into Death Valley.
I think we should jog a bit faster!
But Earthlings, I am one of you. Can't you see it? I am the only one who can save you...
Hm..I seem to have that effect on all the men
Impressive but water is not a factor.
Yeah my feet feel like pins and needles too, but we gotta make our time.
I could have sworn, Robert, that I heard that cactus exclaim, 'Who? Me?!'
It was the only exception that the white supremacy group (aka immigration) would allow into the country.
Fear not! I come in peace!
Wait! I'll hold the water for you!
Those immigrants are getting good.
I hate to be a stickler, but we're trying to cover our tracks.
It must be the raw water!
You had to ask it for water.
Randy, have you ever considered penile implant surgery?
He’d like to stick together.
Don't the Miller's have one just like that? Theirs is always jumping the fence.
Maybe we shouldn't have chewed the peyote
What a pain in the butt.
Keep running! I think it wants to High-5 us.
Run faster, that cactus is chasing us!
Good job....you remembered to bring along some water
Hurry up, Harry! He won’t stop talking about eugenics.
Honey, the cactus thinks we're Jedi holograms.
Stop whining, Junior. Didn't I just say you can have a Coke when we get back to the car?
I guess its hard for them to salute the flag.
LOOKS LIKE HIS GPS GOT FRIED. SHOULD WE CALL THE AUTO CLUB FOR A TOW?
When we pause for a drink that Beast will beat us
Wait! I need help getting to the root of my problems!
It has a thorn in its paw.
Don't stop now.. we can still make the 3:10 to Yuma.
Not #Utoo!
I THINK IT'S CHALLENGING US TO A RACE!
I'm getting a very dry feeling about this.
I'm sorry we don't need drought insurance.
Pick up the pace or we finish last.
Ahhhhhhhh!
Must be a jogging cactus.
It's 'God' spelled backwards.
Stop!! Or I'll Prickle You!!
He has no chance to outpace us if we don’t stop at water station.
It promised not to prick us around if we led it to nearby water.
Uh, honey, climate change is definitely real.
Quick! We’ll jump into that small pond up there next to the overhanging palm tree.
When they said "living desert," they really meant it.
It's not gaining so much as auditioning
...but it's cats that really run the show.
[This is for the cartoon caption contest ending January 14 at 11:59pm. It's already switched to the next week online] "I think ... I think it's a good boy."
Wonder if he would spare some water.
What? You think it's fun standing around here all day. Cactuses need to get healthier too.
Saguaro cactuses are only in Arizona. There are none in New Mexico!
He was always a stickler for performance.
We must go faster to avoid a sticky situation.
Alexa, leave us alone.
Keep moving or you’ll get pins and needles!
If you keep following us I’m going te-quil-ya
I told you it was a bad idea to go for a run in hot weather.
This is NOT funny!
Alexander, did you remember to water the saguaro before we left on this 5K?
He's very insistent on surrendering!
The Day of the Cactus Triffids
So, Earth...you're telling us man is NOT your best friend?
Yeah, they look sorta human, but wait - what?
Ah, George.
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I don't know, I can't seem to escape this prickly heat.
Obviously you have to declare needles at border crossing.
I think he just wants a hug. Run!!!!!!!!!
I know how it's spelled, but it's pronounced "suh-wah-roh". The G is silent.
Shoo!
Bwahaha!!! Who needs a border wall when I am a DRONE CACTUS!!!
Stop following us.
It all started with 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds'.
Run! Sexual harassment is “IN” even in the desert now a days!
Hey, not so fast Saguaro! If border patrol get to the water first, we're screwed!
Git along...I said, GIT ALONG!
Despite Trump and despite his wall, they still found a way!
Cucked by a Cuck-tus.
I don't think he's getting over the wall.
"All I wanted was a hug!" Joe Pitts, Washington, DC
You’re out! He never said, “Simon says” touch the sky.
Wait wait! Tell him my ribs would not a good wall make.
Hey, wait up!! I'm surprised to see you out here!!! Hey wait up!!! I was surprised to see you out here!!!
It's a serious question, Jim. What's your opinion on GMO cacti?
“These peanuts are making me THIRSTY!!
Shoo! shoo! before I get really prickly.
When you reach peak aerobic output, you'll leave no carbon footprint.
Honestly, I said I was lactose intolerant.
We shouldn't have come here during the government shutdown!
He ate too many hot dogs. He's having trouble keeping up.
How does he jog like that without stopping for water?
Run cacti grove, run.
When Cacti Attack
If you don't hurry up we're going to leave you in the dust ... oops, I mean leave you in the sand.
Sparkling or still?
Hey! The desert maybe full of cacti, but I’m the biggest prick!
do you think it thinks we are succulent
I think someone is sending us a message about jogging in the desert!
...I think I left the stove on
He slow jogs to protect his spine.
Let us know if you want to try the vegan diet and fitbit as well as the exercise program.
That's not even the same cactus! No, I swear I saw it move!
It's a prickly situation, Canadians simply aren't permitted.
I am so terrified of The President of the United States!!! It must be Donald TRUMP!! I am such a lousy New Yorker reader I can't think of anything else!!!
Who’s this big guy?
It asked me "What would the W. H. do if a black Norwegian showed up at their doorstep".
Hurry up, I don't want to get spiked from behind.
If he wants it to chase only brown people maybe we need to splice in some of his own DNA.
Don’t look back, something’s gaining.
Are Saguaro friendly?
Well someone needs to spacewalk him
I wish I looked that hydrated.
I see you've been briefed about that aerial
Good boy, Armstrong! Go do your business quickly and get back in here.
He wants to know if the 5 Year Mission is in Dog Years?
Jogging in “ Did we just pass Area 51?
His barking seemed alien.
This is not small, picky situation.
I feel a prickly sensation coming.
Nah, nah. You are a succulent and so is your mother.
'" Warnings can be meaningful. John."
I think that cactus is stalking us.
Looks like Kim Jong-un wants to jog with us.
There's no fire; we're catching a bus.
So where oh where are we going?
We missed the water stop.
Uh, Honey, don't feint, but can we pick up the pace ?
The cactus is gonna catch us!
Hey, when's the next water station?
Total prick.
A giant cactus is chasing us? Saguaro or Prickly Pear?
It's The Touchdown Cactus.
So this is what happens when you don’t calibrate the transporter before its first use...
I wonder what he is running from...
We're gonna have a table plant in no time, hun.
No sorry we really don't need a hug.
It's considered a stalk. Why?
Stop. Stop. It's ME: Prickly Cacti! Your coyote! ?!
The feline said this was the master controller.
We'd better make some tracks or cactus crotch will be a thorn in my side.
I guess it completes the clique', if we drop with him in the frame.
Cholla back ya'll!
"Track of the Stalktus" Roger Corman, 1957
This is not a camouflaged hike.
Cactus Motivation is the new Barry's Bootcamp.
It's just a mirage.
I told you your after-shave was too strong.
Ya' still with, so move yer cactass...
I'm sensing a pointed lack of interest.
Hurry up. If he catches up with us, it will get prickly!
I think we can outrun this border patrol officer, no problemo!
It's not you, it's us. You just can't come to our cuddle party.
Don’t be frightened. He just wants to dance with you.
Hey, maybe we're *not* going in circles after all.
I don't think he wants to pass us.
I think we are close to the border: have your passport on the hand !!!
Cactus, Catch us.
no parents means just desert
Phil, is this your new exercise partner?
For goodness sake, it's the middle of winter! Why is a cactus following us?
No thanks, but maybe one of the genuine pricks of D.C. could fix you up with a nice someone?
So glad you told me'Simon says this is a great place for a hike,' but ...
I know we're jogging but it looks like we're standing still.
Did you forget to feed the cat-tus again?
Don't run away. I just want a hug!
I just realized how thirsty I am.
How far's the next aid station?
Now THIS is what I call a workout!
Run, Cactus, Run.
Walk away slowly, I heard they're dangerous!
I just want to give you a hug.
Larry, do you still have dreams about all that payote we took in college???
The trainer said we might imagine no progress, but really, another dose of the desert flower energizer/refresher will make all the difference.
Hey, if we get thirsty can we use him?
Honey, maybe we shouldn't have spoken to that lonely saguaro.
I voted for Trump. Could I get a hug?
prickly prickly!
Hurry up and run to the car before we get stuck up.
Honey, that prick is following us again...
I told you to file for deferment for those heel spurs.
It's gotta be a Monty Python cactus!
My watch told me to MOVE!
Found the most intelligent life form in a land they call Washington DC.
Oh honey, the dog from the spaceship in Area 51 had a transporter malfunction again.
Charlie, our garden art piece from home has followed us here!
Your GPS equipped cactus was a great work-out concept!
I must be hallucinating, a saguaro cactus is stalking us.
Go back to that s*#thole you call Norway!
One more reason not to hug a cactus.a
He's not waving his arms so he probably does not want us to stop.
Segura promised to keep up with us!
Worst tour guide ever!
With global warming, he'll catch up with us in a few miles.
I don't know which is more disturbing, the moving saguaro or the fact that we're jogging in the desert.
Slow down he wants to surrender!
Hello Mr. Trump
How fast is a Saguarosquatch again?
Would you like a bottle of water for your race?
This is what happens when you make first prize a body wax
I just heard that cactus say “Hey Macarena!”.
I've got to stop taking those prickly pear supplements.
'no its not him ...it's a different and less prickly schmuck'
Haven't you heard of Cactus Friday?
Don't Run...its trying to surrrender.. prickles and all.
Honey, do you smell churros?
How lovely. The corn on my feet now have company.
The only clue found in the bloody aftermath was the mysterious phrase, "Cactus Reus" scratched into the ground.
No we can't stop for a drink of water!
I feel like we've run so far, but we just passed the cactus!
I think it's "left shark".
Pokey!
Looks like he's starting his desert stretch sprint.
I regret this New Year's resolution...
Sing! Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I, It's SupercalifragilisticGumbyalidocious! Even though the sight of it Is something quite atrocious If we run fast enough It’ll merely be hallucinosis.
Honey, did you know that cacti can sweat?!
Come on Jeff, it was your idea to jog in the desert.
QUICK! Follow-Us... Hiding America’s last National Monument
I hate zany jogging costumes!
It's SO great to have someone to jog with.
It thrives on deprivation- unlike us. Our days are numbered!
Stay hydrated.
Are we jogging or fleeing? Is that cactus attacking us or did it just take a knee? Life is too confusing these days.
The wall is coming...let's make a run for it...
Good to know the environment fights back, too, when you call a place a "shithole"!
I have never trusted those saguaro cacti!
I suggest striking more with the forefoot.
I told you we didn’t need to bring his leash, Harold. Good boy, Saguaro!
Macarena my ass.
Honey, we’re being followed by a cocktus.
I think it's trying to tell us that we're going the wrong way!
Faster. I'm saguarophobic!
I hate jogging withyou guys.
what a beautiful day for a desert jog
the cactus is giving us shade from the heat!
How close are we to Los Alamos, again?
Damn, Henry! Just like you to forget your I-Phone.
Thanks for asking, but we're not doing brunch later.
Flora and gaining on ya.
What's the point of this?
So whar'll we go NOW?
Run! It's a cacti scout.
Don't worry. Without sneakers it can't catch us.
Area 52 next stop. Do you think it wants out?
You are welcome to come with us, just inside the home.
Do you think he's afraid of Global Warming?
You sure this isn't a Trojan Rocket whose spines are shaved trapezoid hairs, hon?
Looks like we've awakened the desert folks!
Stop following us; this is not a jog'a'thorn!
Turn west. It's heading north.
I hear he's hydrating . .
Yes, it is a spooky looking cactus. Keep going!
Do you think there could be a Big Foot of the desert?
DO THE CHIPS RUN OUT OUR DO I DIE?!!?!?!?
I just need to outrun you.
This prickly heat is killing me
I think it wants to tango.
Are there Yeti in the desert? If not, that saguaro is following us.
Amazing it can keep up with us. It says it gets exercise walking between buildings...
Who's your friend?
“Honey, I think we are being followed by a cactus porn star”.
I told you we have to drink more water when we jog.
All right, whar did you do with our arms?
That's not fair. It carries all that water.
That's it, people! Step-step-bump! Ow! Step-step-bump! Ow!
House arrest
Aww, can we take him home?
Stop! It's not "Chase Us"!
If it catches up drop, roll and play dead.
Quit sweating so much.
Hey, the desert floor IS alive.
Pick up the pace, we should be covering more ground.
Talk about a prickly pacesetter.
I think it’s time you stop thinking so much about cact-US and start focusing more on cact-I
I know you're gonna think I'm being paranoid, but that pricker tailing us, looks just like my ex.
Remember the mascot we passed at the Cactus Cafe? Well!
Jogging certainly has become very popular.
The stories are true - we are being chased through Superstition Mountain by a saguaro cactus with feet.
I'm having second thoughts about joining SoulCactus.
cactus don't jog, right?
You can’t judge a cactus by his prickers or footprints.
Why is the line dancing instructor jogging behind us?
This isn't what I intended when I yelled, "Sue are you coming?"
Hon? I thought you ordered the "Tumbleweedle" bot to run with us, not that one called "Pursuitactus."
Pokemon, Go!!!
Don't worry. He's the only one with a bad temper.
He always catches us at our water breaks.
A saguaro with arms and legs... Interesting.
Why catch saucer?
Shoo!
W shouldn't jog after doing marijuana.
Are you still going to argue Cactus Man is the new Burning Man?
Glenn whys the cactus following us? Don't ask, touchy subject.
Go chase some golfers!
I've never seen a saguaro pace anybody on this beach.
Faster, he's cactus-upping with us!
Maybe we should’ve just waited until the next water stop instead of trying to drink his fluids.
You’ll never be in swim suit shape at that pace.
Rango told us this would happen, hun.
Weird water station.
Honey, I think junior just fell into a hole.
I told you not to boo when the cactus signaled that the kick was good!
Our reserve water bottle is still keeping up nicely.
That cactus is one evolutionary leap from showing up on #MeToo.
We have nothing like this in our neighborhood. which shithole did this came from?
The Cactus Hombre.
He wants to be part of a conga-line!
I know cacti don't like pee, but this is quite an overreaction!
It’s a dry heat.
I'm sa-guar-n out!
What about Bob?
We don't leave footprints so we're ghosts so whatever.
Run, Cactus, Run.
He really does move like a cat.
No, not like a Cat..... No I think he moves move like your father when he’s in traction.
Keep walking or we’ll get prickly heat!
It thinks we we're headed to a finish line.
There appears to be a big PICK following US !
Seems Nroff was visiting the dog park again.
Hey wait up...it’s just me embracing the environment
Remember when you said that cactus would probably appreciate the extra fluids?
Don't step on it.
Take me to your cats
He just wants to Hydrate!!!
She's prepping for the marathon in Desert Springs next month.
They say this is the coolest thing after hot yoga!

Ok, ok, I get it. It's Cactguy, not cactus
I never thought of putting the us in cactus.
I tell you it said g'bye. Let's get outta here.

Trying to surrender
How do we kill it!
Don't look now but I think "Prickly Pete" is following us.
I JUS HWANT U TO DRIN K MY cactus water
Honey, remember that cactus we used for drinking water? I think he had friends.
I told him with those short legs that he would not be able to stick with us on the walk today.
Anyway, Here's Wonderwall.
This prickly heat rash is killing me!
Are you sure he is not Donald Trump?
Never trust a cactus looking for a hug.
Compatibility is the root of a happy transplant.
Wait, y'all! Let's try Iceland's Viking Victory Chant.
I didn't mean to offend it...

It must be a cousin of the Rolling Stones.
It's either Join me in O-H-I-O or I am cousin of Sasquatch.
Honey, keep running, that's our #1 Draft Prick.

Plight of the Lonely Cactus: “Saguaro from around here?”
I think there's a cactus trying to tell us something.
It was so hot in the dessert the cactus were surrendering to get in out of the heat.
Cactus Tracked Us
I’d like to stop too but my husband gets prickly.
Saguaro y’all goin’ so fast?
I’m really dehydrated. Please do have some water or a soda or something?
Hey wait...I thought you said it was Cact-us!
We’re really in the cactus now!
I told you to beam up a Scottie, not a Labrador Retriever.
It's gaining on us.
Are you sure you’re staying hydrated?
I knew we shouldn't have had a little tequilla.
We should ask him what diet plan he's on.
Maybe somebody just kicked a field goal.
Is this a race or a chase?
The walking dead, that never was alive.
Sticky dicky.
I'm not sure what's going on here, but it's got to be Donald Trump's fault.
Okay. Whose turn is it to walk the dog?
I'm worried about the Nike swoosh.
Run! We are in its prickly path.
Of course you’re his overlord. He follows you around and collects your feces in plastic bags!
No more strays!
it's a clingy plant
Emergency water if we're caught.
Run faster honey! It looks like we are in a prickly situation.

I thought the track coach told us that "practice" was the key to winning the race?
Hurry up...there's a cactus following us
Hey look it’s a namuh
Did you know that a cactus has footprints?
Let's see how smart you are when we turn left!
Deported. Seems that my parents didn't have AKC papers.
It's not harassment--I just need a hug!
It’s following us again. Let’s wait and include it.
That saguro had some shaky steps over the past century.
This shows how we can affect nature.
Red light, green light, 1-2-3!
Wow, looks like the North Koreans have invented stealth missiles!
Honey, could you leave your charisma at the office, just for once?
So this is the guy they call "trump?"
No dessert in the desert!!!
So-where-oh can be safe from this thing?
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD NOT RUN WITH BORDERLINES
Saguero ya going in such a hurry? Hawaii was a false alarm. No time for a prick-me-up?
There may be some lingering resentment.

Fred, that tall plant is following us!
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
Should we put our spike costumes on?
A cactus is chasing us!
I feel undertrained whenever we run with a succulent!
The 'rump is right -- we need a big wall to keep the cacti out.
Look out, a big prick is going to pass us.
Stitch! I said I have a stitch in my side!
These das, no matter what you are, being pricey qualifies you to run ....
I said, 'Hi, cactus,' not 'Hi, catch us.'
So how are oh phonetics catchy.
I told you this was a cactus mascot run.
It has legs. "Let's scram before it pinches us!"
Help!! I've lived here since I was a seed, housing Woodpeckers, Martins, Finches..... but now they are trying to kick me out!
If it didn't have spikes, I'd dump you.
2018 is experiencing record high mirage temperatures.
Who wants to go for a space walk
So how are the schools?
There must be a less surreal way we can find the motivation to exercise.
Maybe you're too old for this, Fred.
Still not winded nor broken a sweat.
I think we're cactus!
Team Cacti just kicked a field goal.

Believe me, I’ve tested a lot worse things when I was in pharmaceuticals.
If he can be President, I can fly.
"Fine, but for our second date you are coming sewer rafting".
Okay, just one more time to clarify...statues are worth 5, newly washed cars 25 and investment portfolio managers...125?
I don't know Mom. I'm starting to think maybe I was adopted.
So he says “pigeons are just rats with wings.” And I was like, “whoa… Rats. With. Wings.”
Yeah, but I identify as a pigeon.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
So, all I do is land in the park and people toss food at me?
It was either this or fly United.
You need good wings to fly; a lot of people don’t know that. I know wings. I’ve got the best wings! No one ever mentions that. No one has better wings, believe me! I’m going to do so much flying you’re going to get tired of seeing me flying!
Well, you don't look like your profile either...
Wait... I was adopted?
And you poop at the same time?!
Either way I’ll be a smash on Broadway.
Oh c'mon, Ratman and Robin. It writes itself!
Last question. I am your first student?
Yes I DO understand the gravity of the situation!
I realize I'm no Batman, but you're no Robin either.
I'm tired of flying commercial. They treat you like vermin.
I got the design from the Da Vinci book I was eating.
I've heard that pigs have been flying since the election.
You also told me he couldn't possibly get elected.
According to my 23andMe results, I’m actually 17% pigeon.
I identify as a pigeon.
Stunt work is okay, but what I'd really like to do is direct.
To you, rat-with-wings is an insult. To me it's a dream.
Yes, it is risky, but I can't stand another day of lab work.
I don't need lessons, because, trust me, I'm like a really smart person.
So it's flap, flap, poop, flap, poop, right?
Because it still beats flying United.
Yeah, and if God wanted birds to lecture me, he would've given you a brain.
I may not be the hero New York City needs, but I am the hero it deserves.
Why did you ask me to pay for my lessons in advance?
You're sure you saw a pig do this?
How come I never get to be in the control group?
OK, last question - is there a Trump statue?
I may be no Batman, but you’re no Robin either.
Because, Estelle, there must be something more to existence than merely carrying the plague.
What do you mean I was adopted?
This isn't what I meant when I told your father I'd convert.
So you say all I need to do is fly to the park and people will feed me?
How do you think I got up here?
OK, I'll do it, but then you have to walk on the subway track during rush hour.
Okay, once I get the head-bob down I think I'll be ready to meet your parents
I’m only going to show you this once
Sometimes you have to take evolution into your own hands.
I’m not the hero this city needs, but I am the hero it deserves.
This is the last time I cover your shift
How come I never get to be in the control group?
Got the wing. Now the prayer.
We can catch a good hot air up-draft at Trump Towers.
I told your parents that I would convert.
I identify as a pigeon.
Lets' just say I'm tired of the old rat race.
If he can be elected President, I can fly.
You can learn a lot living in a hole in the wall at M.I.T.
They think you’re a flying rat! I’ll show them a flying rat.
They call me Die Fledermaus.
I can't actually wait 100 million years, that's why.
Don't worry--I saw a YouTube tutorial on this.
And you're no Robin.
And you'll swim a mile in a sewer, right?
These wings looked bigger online.
Best case? I fly. Worst case? I go viral!
A plan? No, I'm just winging it.
...so I just land near the statue and the tourists throw me food, right?
Thoughts and prayers? That's all you got?
The President tweeted he would stop tweeting when rats could fly!
I eat trash for a living, and you're talking about playing it safe?
He said he’d be impeached when rats fly.
So, just any car?
Theoretically, the bumblebee can"t fly either.
Next date night, I pick the activity.
Wait a sec, you're a mourning dove?
It was this or United.
Trust me. Once they've seen me, they'll never call you that again.
I hadn't really thought of it in terms of cultural appropriation.
What do you mean "I'm adopted"?
I'm doing it just so I can take a crap on Trump Tower.
If this works, your parents will finally have to accept me.
If I don't make it there's a great bread crust and a piece of cheese behind the ventilator.
Talk to me after you spend two years in a government-funded lab experiment.
It beats flying out of LaGuardia.
Yes, I did get certified on-line. Why do you ask?
You're sure a pigeon is just a rat with wings?
It's the only way your dad will ever accept me.
I always felt like I was a pigeon trapped in a rat's body.
They'll remember me as the mouse that soared.
Thus if a pigeon is a rat with wings, then a rat with wings is a pigeon. You're too simple to understand the reflexive property. Why do I even bother?
I've been able to cut 40 minutes off my commute.
If he could be president I can fly!
Flying UP here was the hard part, this bit's easy.
Tell the pig, I did it first!
And stop calling me Icarat.
Either way I'm done with the rat race
So I just hold it until I'm over the windshield.
It was times like this when Estelle wondered if she should tell Tommy that he was adopted.
Got it. Land on wire, then poop.
This still beats flying United
"I may not be Batman, but you're no Robin either".
Last time you said we couldn't be together because we were too different, now you say I am trying too hard?
I think the really hard part is going to be laying eggs.
Yeah well they also said Trump could never win!
Oh, I'll show you a flying rat's ass.
I'm dropping out of the rat race.
How hard can it be if pigeons do it? No disrespect.
It was this or a flight on United.
Say what you will. These will be selling like hot cakes if that wall ever gets built.
And this afternoon I'll teach you how to drag a pizza into the sewers.
It’s more of a theory than a law
Why? Because Disney doesn't make movies about rats who take the subway, Todd.
daVinci better be right.
Are you sure I'm not adopted?
Now would be a good time to tell me if I'm adopted.
All the rats enter Trump Towers from the top.
in this city, you've gotta fake it till you make it, kid!
Okay, I swoop low over the fat guy with the orange hair, hover, then do what...?
Maybe I'm no Batman but you're no robin either.
You're a rat with wings. I'm a rat with wings. I don't see how this can fail!
Yeah, well you're no Robin.
Don’t act like this is the craziest thing you’ve seen in this city.
I know it's risky, Frank, but I just can't be pigeon-holed.
I’m dating a bat, O.K.?
I have actually always identified as a pigeon.
How close to the sun is too close?
If I dont’t survive, tell all 2,000 of my offspring that I loved them.
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow why oh why can't I?
I identify as a bat.
I thought the witness protection program would be different.
So you're telling me with the wings they give you food instead of trying to kill you?
It's my only hope for winning the rat race.
How do I know when I'm getting too close to the sun?
I just want your parents to like me.
If Trump can be president I can fly.
Scurrying around rail beds. Pulling pizza slices down subway stairs. Not anymore, friend. Not anymore.
I’m interviewing for Amazon’s new “Subprime” delivery service.
Sure, the locals still hate me, but at least now the tourists throw me crackers.
When I said I'd be your wingman, this isn't what I had in mind.
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.
I'm tired of hearing you guys called 'flying rats.' I'll show you a flying rat.
And you're sure the old folks in the park won't know the difference?
I should’ve picked ‘Truth’...
I'll wing it.
I yearn for more than just squeaking by.
This is the time... while I still have Affordable Health Care.
Flying too close to the sun is the least of my worries.
My doctor says that I need to live as bird first before he can perform the surgery
It's all meaningless until you learn how to poop on people.
I’m just back from a Tony Robbins seminar.
And you're sure I'm not adopted?
Why did you pick now to tell me I’m adopted?
Is it flap-flap-crap or crap-crap-flap?
So once your in the air, you can just poop on anything?
Car is one, shoulder is three and bald man's head is five, right?
This is the last thing on my bucket list, so no matter what happens I win.
*Now* you tell me that I was adopted?
...and then I poop wherever?
.. because I'm _trying_ to make this relationship _work_ Sandra!
Well, I don’t think you’re a real flight instructor, either.
Yes, I know you are, but 'Ratman and Bobbin' just sounds better.
Either way, I'll be back on the street.
I'm O.K. with my Gender. I'm just unhappy with my species.
I'm not an idiot. They have a money back guarantee.
Sometimes you just have to prove your therapist wrong.
You're sure she's watching.
How hard can it be?
I'm auditioning for "Die Fledermaus".
To you, it's an insult. To me, it's a dream.
This is nothing compared to the time they had me testing LSD.
One way or another, I'm gonna be a hit on Broadway.
I identify as a bat.
This is New York; I have to evolve if I want to win the rat race.
I'm suddenly keenly aware that I have armpits.
I’m quitting the rat race, Barry
Look who's in the White House. Anything's possible.
And you're sure the moon is made of cheese, right?
This is the last step in my transition.
Is it too late to choose Truth?
It was this or that damn wheel for the rest of my life.
I was scheduled to fly United, but this seems much safer.
I know I said I would go next, but I never actually thought that pig would fly
But if it works, we 'll make millions selling them to lemmings.
One small step for rat, one total freakout for New York.
If I don’t make it, tell my wife & 2,000 kids I love them.
I'm not the hero this city needs, but I'm the one it deserves.
Dress for the job you want, not for the job you've got.
If I don't make it back, tell my 500 kids I love them.
Yeah, but you ain't no Robin, either.
So just aim for people already having a terrible day, right?
Bucket list, baby!
If Trump can get elected president then a rat can fly
Pigs got their chance.
You laugh, but have you ridden the subway lately?
It's either this or go back to the lab and take my chances.
You'd be surprised at what we learn at the lab
If you lived in a sewer you’d understand.
Now, let's see what this whole pooping-from-the-sky thing is all about!
We have conquered the gutters, it's time to infest the skies!
I saw a pig fly by yesterday and thought, "why not?"
My first attempt at flight was going perfectly until the airline said I wasn't an emotional support animal
I saw this work for a squirrel once.
I don’t know. If God wanted rats to fly, wouldn’t we all be pigeons?
How long have you been a personal trainer?
Gotta go, Trump wants to meet me about the FAA director position.
I knew Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Mighty Mouse!
I'm telling you - we have more to contribute to science than navigating mazes.
I'm not the hero this city needs, but the hero it deserves.
So, what you're saying is, little old ladies will just give me food?
They say, 'Dress for the job you want.'
Got it: “Don’t look down.” What else do I need to know?
It’s our ability to adapt that has sustained us for millions of years.
Birds do it. Bees do it. ....
It's on my bucket list.
The subway just isnt safe anymore.
Oh, yeah? They said Trump wouldn't be President either!
If Donald Trump can get elected President, I can fly.
I have always felt like I was a pigeon stuck in a rat's body.
And then I get to crap on the statue?
So then I get the Hamilton tickets, right?
Wait. Did you say flap-flap-glide or flap-glide-flap?
I've always identified as a bat.
The Met has a casting call for Die Fledermaus
Great time to tell me I’m adopted.
Move, you idiot, we're shooting a movie.
Because the cat's still away, and I'm running out of ideas.
I'm taking the rat race to a whole new level.
Of course I can't - that's why I teach.
Did you know all along I was adopted?
When pigs fly, it’s a big deal. When PIGEONS fly, it’s normal. But when RATS fly, all hell will break loose.
Don't just stand there, coo something!
The orange hair – you can't miss it.
You need anything while I'm out?
So--my first targets are park statues and red headed men?
Yes, but it comes with a lifetime warranty.
Got it. Never on the wrinkled ones because they give us food.
How hard could it possibly be?
The pig said this would be easy!
So you're telling me I just have to crap on those statues and people will give me free food?
... and a giant leap for ratkind.
I hope this makes you recognize how committed I am to our relationship.
Dangerous? Swimming up into someone's toilet, now that's dangerous!
This isn’t what I had in mind when I said I’d convert for you.
Oh, I’m no Batman? Well you’re no robin.
Well, I’m a lab rat. We’ll try anything.
Can't you try a little harder to talk me out of this?
This is where analogies come to die.
She waited, serene in the knowledge that if she could make it through his ratsplaining, her reward would be unspeakably sweet.
I haven’t been able to fly commercial since the crackdown on support animals.
It’ll be fine, I watched a YouTube video on it
Well, you're no Robin
I figured, 'What the hell... we're both carriers!'
Still not the weirdest thing I've seen a rat do in New York.
I’ll admit my profile picture was lightly edited.
Pigeon, schmidgeon... wait'll they see a REAL flying rat!
They said impeachment will come when “pigs fly,” do I count?
Don’t worry. I watched a YouTube video about how this is done.
Of course they'll work. They wouldn't sell them if they didn't work.
Remember the name, Elon Muskrat.
I'm beta testing the new Amazon delivery system for NYC
So I just walk around bobbing my head and then people will feed me?
I want to be the mouse that soared.
When I said I'd be your wingman, this isn't what I had in mind.
Seriously, I could fly down 5th Avenue and nobody would stop me!
So, it’s just like riding a bike?
It can't be any worse than the subway.
How about I teach you to lay an egg instead?
Do I look like a bat in this thing? I feel like I look like a bat.
I'm in transition.
So then I head to a park bench and they'll just throw food at me?
These days, you gotta think outside the sewer.
Yeah, they called the Wright brothers crazy too.
Yeah, yeah - thank you for your input . . . everybody thinks they're an expert . . .
I was hoping for a robin as a sidekick, but you'll do.
The Same Experts said that Trump Couldn't Win the Presidency.
When you are only one in ten billion, you gotta try and make a name for yourself.
Now I can carry airborne diseases, too!
You said you'd support my transition.
This is on my bucket list.
Yes, I realise the irony.
Why is it always "...if pigs could fly"?
I'm leaving the Trump administration!
Unlike you, I don't want to be pigeonholed.
And you promise this is how you started?
Don’t look so surprised. You know that’s what they’ve been calling you for years.
But pigs have very different aerodynamics!
My lab buddies need an aerial view of the maze.
Look at me! I’m an urban cliché.
Hold my cheese.
Are you sure this is what it’ll take to get your parents’ approval?
Why must I always prove myself? Can't you accept me as I am?
Hey, if a pig flew in 2016, anything's possible!
What makes you such an expert?
I'm auditioning for "Die Fledermaus".
So I says to her, 'If this was such a stupid idea, why would your mother buy these for me in the first place?'
My cousin tells me the streets are made of cheese in Jersey. CHEESE, Larry.
Scurrying is so undignified.
Evolution ain't gonna happen by itself...
What do you mean I was adopted?
If this works, I'll teach you how to swim in the sewer.
You're no Robin yourself.
Orville, we know I'm Wright.
There was a time all you had to do was drag a slice of pizza
There's the Rat Signal. I've got to go.
We’ve conquered the subway. Now, we take the sky.
What’s REALLY crazy is the money back guarantee.
I said I'd convert for the kids, but don't expect me to do this every weekend.
It's the landing part that I'm a little worried about.
If I'm Ratman, you're Bobin.
Of course, if I were a daredevil, I'd attempt to RUN across 5th Avenue.
So you can really just poop right on their heads?
I’ve always felt like I was a bat born in a rat’s body.
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.
Come on, this can't be as bad as running on the subway tracks.
I'm being transferred to Washington next week and just thought I'd get a little practice in jumping ship.
It's OK, they come with a lifetime guarantee!
It's the only way your father will ever accept me.
Whaddaya mean rat and bat rhyme with splat?
I can't take the subway anymore since the pizza video went viral.
No, Shirley, not a genius; just a rat with a dream.
So, if I make it, old people give me free food in the park for life?
Maybe it's time we told your parents the truth.
The sewers have become too gentrified
Well you don't look like your picture either!
This is hard, but try dodging a subway train every once in a while.
If this idea works, I can finally quit the rat race.
Is it jump then flap or flap then jump?
"For the last time, I did not lie on my dating profile, and I think we are very compatible".
So your saying if I fly down to the park, people will just feed me?
Why when we first met did you say our differences wouldn't matter?
See, this is why you should never date outside your species.
Well, if Trump can get elected...
On second thought, I'll take "truth."
fine , don't tell me how you do it then
We're all abandoning Trump's administration.
Ratman and Bobbin to the rescue!
Yeah, but since the election, public support for airborne, disease-ridden rodents has risen, particularly among evangelicals.
Let's see how well the analogy holds up...
'Remember if they don't feed you, you're allowed to shit on them'
In case I don't survive, my ratatouille recipe is in the crevice of the stairway at the base of the Eiffel tower.
Birds fly over the rainbow, why oh why can't I ?
What are you looking at? I’m not the first one to escape Trump Tower.
Stop whining! No one gives a flying rat's ass.
I need to try a different mode of transportation. The sewers are full of politicians these days.
You're basically just a rat with wings too.
"If you morons can do this, how hard can it be?
I figure most people who feed pigeons are old and can't see that well.
Me, metaphor. You, simile.
It's the only way your family will accept me.
I'd better go or I'll be late for Congress!
Beats flying United.
Now comes the part where you say: "don't do it...you've got your whole life ahead of you!"
A pigeon is not a "rat with wings". I, Marty, -I- am a rat with wings!
I will not be pigeonholed!
If Trump can become president, we can do anything.
Wait a minute, what exactly do you mean by “adopted”?
I knew I shouldn't have lied on my CV.
This may give a whole new meaning to "rodent dropping."
We're the only ones willing to perch on Trump Tower.
Tomorrow I’ll need you to teach me how to poop on their heads.
Last thing on my bucket list.
I've always wanted to poop on someone's head
If this doesn't get your mother to welcome me to the family, I don't know what will.
It's probably the right time to let you know you're adopted.
Worst case scenario, I'll be another Smash hit on Broadway.
I'd rather take a chance than fly United.
And you're no Robin.
One small step for a rat, one giant nightmare for mankind.
After that election, I figured if pigs can fly, why not me.
I’m not saying you shouldn’t be a bird, Larry. I’m just suggesting that you consider identifying as a penguin or a kiwi.
At least wait for Mueller's report!
I'm Ratman and you can be a robin.
The sewers were just becoming too mainstream.
What's the worst that could happen?
The Met is holding auditions for a new production of Die Fledermaus.
Is this the last thing I have to do to join the club?
If I don't make it, please notify my 842 kids.
Why is it always the rat who has to convert?
I feel like a droned rat.
So they just give you bread?
Nothing to it? We'll see if you can swim up into a toilet!
Or I could put a wig on my tail and be a squirrel.
I want people to feed me in the park.
When you lie on your resume but get the job anyway
You make me want to be a better rat.
Of course it will work. I saw it on youtube.
Gotta get up to Yankee Stadium. It's bat day
Have you ever felt like you were born into the wrong body?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I don't need to know how to fly ... just how to land.
I love you, Sheila. And I hope this will help your father to accept me.
And how will I know which people to poop on?
I’m actually a very stable genus
I’m not the hero this city needs, I’m the hero it deserves
I got the idea from the pig.
I ate breadcrumbs in the square. I bathed in the fountain, for crying out loud. This is it Louise.
Let's see if it's nature or nurture.
Yeah, I'm jumping off this Trump Tower ship. Like everyone else.
One small step for rats, one giant leap for ratkind.
And tomorrow I’ll teach YOU how to scare the shit out of people in the subway.
So, one step forward and then flap, flap, flap?
If I don't make it, tell my 758 children I love them.
I told the director I wanted to do all my own stunts, but honestly, I'm glad you're here.
Yeah... but Icarus used wax.
Know what's ironic? They call YOU guys rats with wings...
So you're sure there's cheese up there?
I call it extreme dumpster diving.
five, four, three, two, one . . . . . minus one, minus two, minus three
Don't look so smug. Lets see how good you are crawling through a sewer
I figure my chances are still better than Cynthia Nixon's.
I’m finished with the underworld.
Last time you didn't believe I could drag a slice of pizza down the subway stairs.
So all I gotta do is land in front of the guy on the bench, look real cute, coo, and he'll just give me food?
And I say a pigeon is a rat without whiskers.
‘Pizza Rat’ is the old me. Now I am ‘Elon Musk-Rat.’
Remember, always aim for the windshield.
This is my last attempt to get fed in the park.
The simulation did not prepare me for this moment.
In your experience, is it better to aim for the cars or the people?
I'm tired of being pigeon holed.
Unless i’m missing something, this should work.
And your only advice is "Don't fly too close to the sun"?
And this is where you just have to hope the physics work out
so you're telling me if i stand on the street with these wings on, people will give me bread
Go ahead, laugh. Let's see you drag a slice of pizza down a flight of stairs.
No, I don’t want to fly. I’m signaling to Karl on the Chrysler building.
I'm going to get your father's approval or die trying.
It’s time you know the truth that you were adopted.
I'm the best flier that you've ever seen, believe me. Nobody in the history of the world knows more about flying than me. Only I can overcome gravity.
Flying rats?!? I'll show them flying rats.
See the lady with the cruller?
Rat? Bat? Don't try to pigeonhole me, Dave."
So far, so good.
Sure, the food pellets are good and I can run all the mazes blindfolded, but I keep thinking there's got to be something more.
Bat, rat, splat. What’s the difference?
Either way, nobody will give a rat's ass.
ACME, why do you ask?
I’m beginning to see why I paid in advance.
I always wanted to land on Broadway.
Why aren't you supportive of my transition?
Ratman and Pigeon - has a nice ring to it.
Of course, this will just reinforce ignorant stereotypes.
Maybe I should’ve gone with the swim-with-dolphins package.
Wait a minute ... you seem almost too eager for me to try this.
Why not? If anybody can be President. . .
Go home Larry, I do my own stunts.
They say I'm a rat but I identify as a flying squirrel.
I refuse to be pigeonholed.
They said I could return it if it didn't work.
No, I've never been called that. Why?
Well you don't look much like Robin either.
Because I wanna strike fear into the hearts of men, Larry. That's why!
I'm good--I watched a YouTube.
If I do this, will your mother finally accept me into the family?
No, but I do have experience as a reality television host and real estate tycoon.
Once I figure out echolocation I'll be invincible.
Gotham may have Batman and Robin fighting crime, but in New York City it's up to us, Ratman and Pigeon.
Because I don't NEED healthcare. Why do you ask?
Are you sure this is how you started?
I'm applying for Amazon's new delivery service.
Plus, I've always wanted to poop on some hedge fund dude wearing a $2,000 suit.
At least it’s better than coach.
It’s not appropriation. It’s an hommage.
How hard can it be? Any birdbrain can do it.
It's no longer enough to drag around a slice of pizza.
They're not meant for flying. They're meant to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, Robin. May I call you 'Robin'?
Okay, but after this I'm teaching you to crawl under subway cars.
I AM a 'fledermaus'! I AM a 'fledermaus'!
"So if they call you a flying rat, what am I"?
Once I had kids, it was either fly or move to New Jersey.
Shut up. I’ve got this.
It's Manhattan... I can't afford the sewer.
So my wife says, ‘Stop complaining about the sewers being crowded and DO something about it!’
LIMERICK: There once was a rat, name of Pete...Who questioned if he could pull off such a feat...Reply of the pigeon,.."I think it's a good decsion."...Minutes later, she had something to eat.
You won't see me living on the street again.
Why should pigs get all the credit?
Let’s face it, I’m no Batman, and you’re no Robin.
This should cut my commute in half.
You said your parents would never accept me unless I converted, so here goes.
The things you do to get likes on Youtube.
Look at us. Just two rats with wings.
By day, a rat and a pidgeon. By night..... RATMAN and ROBIN!
Run that updraft thing by me one more time.
My friend bought a ticket on United but I wanted to fly with less risk.
Yes, Society sees me as a rat, but I self identify as a pigeon.
I'll just wing it!!!
So then she said, "What could be more annoying than pigeon poop?"
This video is going to be spread like the plague.
What do you mean "I'm adopted"?
My second cousin is a bat, so I think it’s in my blood.
No, I’m pretty sure it was the rat signal.
I know it isn't a great name, but Batman was already taken.
Well if this doesn't work I'll just be another rat dropping.
Okay fine. I'll admit I have Genus envy.
This is the worst part about being adopted!
The rat race just got a whole lot easier!
Look, it can't be worse than the subway.
Just in case, I’m an organ donor.
I may be a dirty rat but I'm no stool pigeon.
Recent events have convinced me that any old rat can soar.
They call YOU rat with wings?" I'll show 'em a rat with wings!
These are the new model, Icarus 2.0
I can't wait until you carrier pigeons aren't on strike anymore.
I'm going to bring infestation to new heights.
Okay. Now what?
Remind me what we're trying to prove here?
Yeah, yeah, steer with your tail. Keep your airspeed up. And remember; altitude is your friend.
I've always identified more as a pigeon.
According to what I read on the internet, this should work.
I may have been born a rat but I identify as a bat.
The flying is easy enough but the constant head bobbing is killing me.

If this works, we're 'Ratman and Bobbin'' and we'll clean up this city.
You're not the only flying rat in this town!
No, I never saw the end of ‘Birdman’, why?
That's right, Birdboy. If this works, Ratman is gonna need a sidekick.
One great step for verminkind!
Birds do it, bees do it, now my educated fleas are gonna do it.
I don’t give a rat’s ass what you think.
Just jump? That's easy for you to say!
...... One small step for ratkind.
I’ll do this, but I won’t convert.
Step off? That's all you've got?
Confession time, Loretta. I'm just a rat.
On second thought, maybe I should do a test flight by jumping off a curb.
We'll see who the bottom feeder is now.
Just one more step to permanently delete my Facebook.
Hey, it beats dragging a piece of pizza around in the basement.
So this is how you got your start?
They want a flying rat, I will give them a flying rat!
If this works, pigs are next. I'll be rich if some people keep their word.
Sure, it's dangerous. But the tourists love it.
Not a problem if it doesn't work. I kept my receipt.
They all laughed at the Wright Brothers' hamster, too.
I don't care if your commute is faster. Next time we're taking the subway.
o.k. then, Let's see if they can tell us apart now.
I know, but could you call yourself Robin?
Let's face it, I'm the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs.
Do you see the rat symbol in the sky?
Icarus shmicarus.
It’s called “intelligent design”...same reason you stopped being a dinosaur.
If I can make it here, I'll make it anywhere.
Looks like you'll have to re-brand once we master this.
Sometimes evolution needs a little help.
I know...but how else am I going to get out to the Hamptons on a Friday afternoon?
'It was a graduation gift from my life coach'
OK, but after this, you have to drag a slice of pizza down the stairs while someone shoots a video
Maybe now I'll get the kind of respect you've earned in this city.
?? ?? ?? ?? Heeeere I come to save the daaaay...................
They call you guys “rats with wings”. I’m going to be a pigeon with teeth!
Your parents will have to accept me now!
It all started when I developed this burning desire to crap on on heads of statues.
You're the wind beneath my wings, Esther.
Well...I heard all the pigs are doing it.
All of the pigs are already flying, so we're next in line.
What's your favorite statue?
Hey, you're a different height than what you said in your profile, so consider us even!
Yeah, maybe it'll work better from higher up.
One way or the other it'll be out of the rat race for me.
...And you’re not a robin. This is about fighting crime, not authenticity.
What do you mean there are already flying rats?
I heard some pigs tried it once, so I thought ‘why not?’
Beats taking the sewer during rush hour
I am literal and you are just metaphorical.
Ratman and Pigeon! We'll be huge!
On second thought, I’d rather fight.
Yes, it really is a race.
‘Na, na, na, na, na Rat Man, Rat Man.
Sure... but the other fifty is you probably die.
It can't be any dumber than that maze thing.
Just to be sure, that's the Trump Tower, right?
Yeah, I decided long ago that cross-town traffic at this hour was just not worth dealing with.
Last time I tried this, Hurricane Sandy took me to Copenhagen.
Of course I can fly, you bird brain!
Yes, you’re a rat, and I’m a stool pigeon. When I said we’re the same, this is not what I meant.
Consider this an evolutionary leap.
You're very kind, but they're extensions
I got these on eBay ... watch this...
I'm not worried, they came with a double-your-money-back guarantee.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah RAT MAN!
You don't have a rat's chance of making it.
I spent the best years of my life being injected, electrified and run through mazes. But over time, I picked up enough bits of scientific knowledge to attempt my escape.
If this doesn't work - I'm going to be real annoyed.
But how do you know when to poop?
But then you must agree to walk on the subway tracks during rush hour
??? If Dirty Nasty Pigeons fly, beyond the Hudson River wide, why-oh-why caaannnt' I I I ? ???
Icarus didn’t listen. Will you?
Believe it or not, this will be my first time.
If this works I'll show you the sewers and how to chew through anything.
I'd like to see you try to crawl through a sewer and come up in a toilet.
Who the hell is Leonardo da Vinci?
Because the Kushners can no longer afford stone gargoyles.
See you in Mar-a-Lago, sucker!
Look, this is the last time I'm going to show you how to do this.
And you’re sure people will just throw their bread at me?
People call you a rat with wings too, you know,
Hey, if Trump can become President this should be easy.
It dawned on me, with all the pigs flying, I have to take my shot.
What can happen, right?
I’m sorry, my sidekick has to be a robin.
End of discussion. We're both flying rats, okay?
‘Rat Man and Pigeon.’ Guess that will have to do.
If it's not possible, why did they sell me these wings?
Everybody's a critic.
And then it hit me, "what's so bad about rats with wings?"
Pigeons are just flying rats? I'll show them a flying rat!
Just call me, Icarats
I believe in truth, justice and American cheese.
Come along, Pigeon Lad! There is much filth and disease to spread throughout this city!
No, I'm not bat shit crazy.
I'm Ratman, you're Robin
I found them in a box marked "Free" on Wall Street.
You know what they say: dress for the job you want.
Yeah, but I still identify as a rat.
Don’t worry. The lesson comes with a money back guarantee.
I was born a rat- but I self-identify as a bat.
This has got to be better than taking the subway.
Ok, I ate the yogurt and blueberries, now how do I aim?
All I'm saying is there are some unavoidable biological constraints, dude.
I just want to feel the wind in my hair.
It can’t be that hard.
Betcha I’m the first one to reach the ground.
I really DO want this relationship to work, but don't you think your parents will learn to love me even if we just walk to their place?
All right, already. But don't expect me to lay an egg when I land.
I wish we could have started on a bunny slope.
Don't fly too close to the slum.
I figure if anyone can be President, why can't I be a pigeon.
Call me Icarat.
This town ain't big enough for the thirty million of us.
You do what you want. I’m not paying surge pricing on an Uber pool.
Now tell me again what I am supposed to do when I fly over someone's head.
Nothing personal, but subway travel is for the birds.
This isn’t what I had in mind when I asked you to be my wingman
This is how you learned right?
I'm trans-species . . . . rat to bat.
I got tired of people calling me a pigeon without wings.
Just Jump ?". How about I take you to the sewer and say " Just Jump?
It's for a podcast.
When you say you’re proficient on your resume but then they ask for a demonstration.
In theory, they won't be able to tell us apart.
Because 'Rat-Man and Pigeon' doesn't have the same ring to it, that's why.
To the Ratmobile, Bobbin'!
I'm exactly what I appear to be: a high-flying infester.
Why won't it work? They say you're just a rat with wings.
are you sure your parents will finally accept me?
There's nature, then there's nurture.
So they call you guys flying rats, huh? Wait 'til they get a load of me.
For years, I've felt pigeonholed.
I'm the hero New York deserves...
We are now Ratman and Bobbin!
Yeah, well I look as much like Batman as you look like Robin.
They won't let me fly as an emotional support companion, so...
Da na na na na na na na na na na na na... Rat Man!
Well, I might not be Batman, but you are certainly no Robin.
Birds gotta sing. Rats gotta fly.
Forget Pigeon. From now on you’re Robin.
I thought my agent was joking, but hey, they gave Ben Affleck a shot at this.
What about 'Ratman' - too obvious?
They say you guys are just rats with wings.
Because I'm the hero Gotham deserves...
I'm the hero they deserve, but not the one they need.
And you said they'll throw bread crumbs to me?
It is not the most intellectual or strongest that survives, but the species that is able to adapt and best adjust..
I figure it's just a difference of one letter.
With the overcrowding, scurrying isn't effective anymore.
Apparently pigs can.
Honestly, I was sick of the rat race.
I’ve disappointed my father for the last time.
So, rats with wings is it? I'll show you rats with wings!
NOW IF TRUMP CAN WING IT, WHY CAN'T I?????
Born in the sewers but sky's the limit. Yeah, I'm living the dream.
Why do I always have to be the wingman?
They say, 'Dress for the job you want.'
If I go splat, feel free to eat me.
I'm not worried. It's guaranteed for life.
Call me Icarat.
I've had enough of this rat race.
Of COURSE they're modeled on bat wings. Do I look like a damn bird?
For the record, we weren’t the ones who called you ‘rats with wings.’
What exactly about 'Ratman and Pigeon' sounds derivative to you?
I’m training for the lead in “The Mouse that Soared”.
How much could it hurt?
I know, but you were the one wanting a show of commitment to our relationship
I'm taking dumpster diving to the next level.
Risky, yes. But you’ve never had to depend on the A train.
Everybody has a midlife crisis.
It's all in the wrist.
I'm tired of being referred to as "pigeon without wings".
Of course nobody will notice until it's on YouTube.
Can't you see, Loretta? If we're gonna build a future together, it can't be in the sewers.
Can you go over the landing part one more time....
So would you recommend gliding or flapping?
I’m auditioning for Die Fledermaus next week.
It’s time I live my truth.
Sure, it's overly-ambitious and completely unrealistic, but it's my evolutionary imperative.
I know I'm adopted mom, but I gotta do it!
I'm not worried about the flying part,It's the landing.
Hey, I did not rat on my cousin. I'm no stool pigeon and this should prove it.
You may have heard of me and my brother Orville, the Rat Brothers.
It's all in the wrist.
You don't hear us calling ourselves the 'pigeons of the ground' do you?
You wrestle one slice of pizza, people assume you're a superhero.
If this works, I’m heading straight for the popcorn in Central Park.
If you call me Batman, I'll call you Robin.
This'll work. I'm sure Wile E. Coyote just misread the instructions.
Think happy thoughts... think happy thoughts...
Ok, I'm ready. As soon as you see someone drop a bagel, I'll be right behind you.
I'll die the way I lived... Freaking people the fuck out.
It's not a competition
I want to get hired by Amazon
This is what Darwin was talking about.
I've got dreams...big dreams. Sure, I came up the hard way by the stairs, but I am going to fly into history.
You know what? This is starting to feel like a trap.
It's Time Square. Tourists will pay big for a picture with Ratman and Bobbin!
They want a rat with wings, I'll give them a rat with wings.
I gotta be me!!!
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
You're telling me this is how the chicken crossed the road?
If this works out I'm hoping I never have to take the subway again
One leap for rat kind.
I don’t think they mean it literally, Carl.
Dada Dada Dada Da.....Ratman!
I'll try this, you try living in the sewer.
Just take me back to the basement. I promise, no more flying rat jokes.
The species-identity movement has come a long way.
You said your parents would never accept me as I am.
It’s on my thimble list.
Which way to Trump Tower? I'm late for an appointment."
These actually make me a pigeon in the eyes of the law.
Tonight, we rewrite epidemiology!
I hope this power failure is over soon; I'm sick of being the Bat-signal.
The subway has gotten too dirty for me.
Just once, I want to dive bomb a tourist.
It's more reliable than taking the subway.
I voted against the merger.
Death to metaphors...
I'm bringing new meaning to the term "rat-race".
Fish gotta swim, rats gotta fly...
Call me crazy, but I really think this is going to strengthen our relationship.
I know it's risky, but it's worth it to get out of here before Mueller traps me.
I keep hearing them call YOU a 'rat with wings' so I figured, what the hell.
My dad will still not approve of you.
My name is Muskrat. Elon Muskrat.
MIGHTY MOUSE MADE IT LOOK EASY
And after I get the hang of this, I'll show you the sewers.
I just want to see these morons' faces when they see a real flying rat.
Here I come to save the day...
Okay, so flapping these, like this, will pull me out of the initial steep dive, right?
Pigeons are flying rats huh? I'll show you a flying rat.
I can’t do this unless you throw some cheese over the ledge.
Your Uber Eats driver is on his way.
So the rental guy tried to upsell me a GPS. I mean, what an idiot, right?
My therapist thought it might help make me more repulsive.
Because this is a lot more fun than hanging upside down!
You're still my wingman, right?
I got this.
It's our final chance at upward mobility!
I'm not leaving the sinking ship - I'm just taking a break from the hostile political environment.
No, I AM the rat with wings.

Uber refused to pick me up
if Mighty Mouse can do it, so can i
They're a gift my cousin Wile E Coyote, he's a super genius, what could go wrong ?
$1500 for an image consultant and this is what he came up with.
Remind me again how we're related?
So if it doesn't work, you say I'll get my money back?
Any last minute advice?
So they call you a rat with wings, huh? I'll show them a rat with wings!
One step for a rat, one giant leap for ratkind.
I on the other hand can remove my "wings" if I need to, miss smarty pants
How hard could it be?
Aim for the park, land on your hind legs and try to look like you own the joint.
Don’t worry. I tested this in the lab.
Trust me it's a socially upward move.
Got any tips?
I'm tired of taking the subway.
Getting a head start on the rat race
My life coach told me to embrace change.
My wife calls this a mid-life crisis.
So Ralphie sez to me, what, you don't keep a bucket list?
You sure this will end with me getting bread crumbs?
?After I deliver the message do I have to FLY back here, or do they BRING me back here?"
Is there still time to qualify my ‘I can do anything you can do’ statement?
Eventually, you just gotta lean into it.
Look who’s calling who a rat with wings.
Hmmm, seems like cultural appropriation to me...
And then what?
I wish you'd just embrace your ratness.
Nobody ever sits and feeds the rats; this should fool them.
"Rats with wings": to you, it's an insult, but for me, it's my greatest dream.

I must go Alfred, Gotham needs me.
Did I mention that I'm seeing a life coach?
Don't worry, I kept the reciept
The hero Gotham deserves.
The subway got too crowded.
Don't you know how many views Pizza Rat got?
If I pull this off, your days in the plaza are numbered.

That's funny - they call me that too.
If this works they'll be feeding me in the park!
Uber Schmuber!
Rats with wings? Ha. I’ll show em rats with wings.
It’s more of an homage to pigeon culture
I still don't understand how you aim for their heads while you're flying.
So this is what happens to stool pigeons.
Tomorrow we’re hanging out in the subway
I was taught you just jump! It worked for me.
Ratman and Pigeon, we'd make a great duo.
Well, he's not really a bat either
Introducing the new Facebook Messenger.
I’m the hero Gotham needs
So, I said to myself, "It's this or three more years of Trump. What's to lose?"

No, I'm just covering for the bat until sunset.
Geez. If I were blind as a bat this would be a hell of a lot easier.
First I'm hitting Woody Allen's place.
You try living in the sewers your whole life.
Dumb idea!? As opposed to, like, living in a subway tunnel?

You're sure I can transfer at Fifth Avenue?

And you say a pig has never tried this?
I'm tired of the race, so I thought I'd wing it.
Folks refer to you guys as "rats with wings." I'm gonna' show them the real deal.
They say you and me, we're not so different.
I’m going to go for it. I’m tired of waiting for a signal.
Pecking and perching was easy but this lesson seems a bit challenging.
Why do you always get to be Robin?
This is the last time I am playing truth or dare with you!
Once I master this, the sky’s the limit
Who cares what God wanted?

You might remember me from the title role in Die Fledermaus.
It's the return flight that always gets ya.
Plan B is I take the stairs.
I'm going for that sweet spot: under the radar, and above the rat race.

The difference between us is that you really do have the capacity to rise above it all.
It's fine if that other guy wants be the hero that Gotham deserves; I'll be the hero that Gotham can't get rid of.
I'm the real hero this city deserves
Trust me, Batman was fired. By appointment of the oval office, I give you, Rat Man!
Are you sure this is how you learned to do it?
Real Pigeons are made, not born.
Let’s race to the bottom
Yeah, well you're no Robin.
If this works, you've got to take a turn in the subways.
Fine, you're not a robin and I'm not a bat, but someone needs our help!
They call you a flying rat - wait 'til they get a load of the real deal.
If I fail, then the endless comparisons die with me.
I feel like this is just perpetuating the stereotype.
Deal. But as soon as I get back, you have to walk across the subway tracks.
We're not so different, you and I.
One way or another, I'm going to earn my wings today!

So long, suckers.
Flying’s for the birds!
Okay, pal. I sure hope you're right about this.
Do I really have to do this on our first date?
I identify as a pigeon now.
I’m done spending summers hungry. I’m joining the Rosenblatts in the Hamptons.
Are your sure they'll think I'm a pigeon?
Time to give up your YouTube throne, Pizza Rat!
You have to understand, sometimes it doesn't matter how much you believe!

I see it as a giant leap for ratkind.
I am Ratman! I guess you can call yourself a robin if you want.
I’m shifting the paradigm of the rat race.
Maybe my parents were right about mixed marriages.
There it is. The 'Rat Signal'!

And they will call me - VERMAN!
The things I do for love...
I like being a carrier, the hours are flexible and you meet all kinds of people
I am going to make your parents love me!
They only put up the Rat Signal when the crime involves a pile of garbage.
Ok now. One giant leap for Ratkind!
I mean, if Da Vinci could do it...
Got it, land on the statue after I crap on the guy in the suit. Then a roasted nut lunch with the old guy on the bench.
They call you rats with wings, and so I got to thinking!
I identify as a pigeon - that's how it works, right?
It beats taking the subway.
If I can make it here...
Well, the pig flew last week, so I guess you're good.
One small step for mouse, one giant leap for mousekind!
I'm tired of being called a wingless pigeon
And after this, I'll show you how to drag some pizza down the subway steps!
You really think I should practice on the statue before I go for the guy in the new suit?
My inspiration is Der Fledamouse
No, the saying is when pigs (italicized) fly
They call you rats with wings, but they feed you. So I thought to myself, "Why not give it a try"?
I'm telling you, if Affleck can play him, then so the hell can I!
You ain’t the only flying rat
I figure a pigeon is really just a flying rat anyway, so I should be good, right?
I'll be Ratman if you'll be Robin.
You think you’re the only rat who can fly?
And why NOT Ratman?
Golly gee willikers, we're Ratman and Bobbin!

Roadkill ratatouille beats sewer souffle any day.
You looked younger in your profile picture.
We used to have a lab for this sort of thing, but the rent got too high. Now it's a hot yoga studio.

Now at bat: Mickey Mantle Maus!
Today, I'm on dishes and you're on garbage.
Isn't it enough that you are lord of the streets?
I'm tired of you guys getting all the attention as the rat air force.

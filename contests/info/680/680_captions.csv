Mobster, Larry. The invitation said to dress like a mobster.
You pinch me one more time and your going to find yourself in hot water.
Do that again and I'll put the rubber bands back on.
I can’t believe you wore shorts. EVERYONE was staring.
When you said on the phone " I'm Claude"  , I assumed it was your name.
You need to stop introducing yourself as my Maine squeeze.
It's not the claws. It's the screaming every time you get in the hot tub.
She comes to a party with a wooden mallet and a pick.  Don't tell me she didn't have her eyes on you the whole night!
Oh, I’M crabby?
I figured "must love shellfish"  was coded language for "not Jewish."
I thought you said selfish.
I thought you said your relatives were mobsters
Let’s just skip the foreplay.
You deserve butter.
Yeah. Like you’re such a great catch.
How would you like always being introduced as "the turf"?
The worst part is - my last boyfriend's hands were clammy!
How did you even manage to swipe right?
Why would you think that’s what I meant by “grow a pair”?
It's just that I could use a hand every once and a while.
With you, it's always one step forward, two steps sideways.
If you pinch me one more time,  I'm putting the rubber bands back on.
I just think having all of your profile pictures be headshots was misleading.
The nerve, kicking us out! The sign clearly says they serve seafood!
'That 'clawed your way to the top' thing is just not funny anymore..
Usually, 'a long line of lobstermen' refers to one's profession."
Your fly's unzipped.
I notice those aren't handy for picking up the check.
You had three wishes, Gary! Three!
Don't make me put the rubber bands back on.
Yes - I do think my parents will notice.
When you said you were transitioning, I had something else in mind.
So, now that you've taken the gloves off, is there anything else I should know?
Sorry, I prefer men with big mussels "
...but no....you had to go and snap my mother's head off.
I do the parking meter. I do the ATM. I'm sick of it.
How come they didn't ask the woman who had the frog legs to leave?
You expect me to believe that's why you never text me back??!!
Shorts and a long sleeve shirt? Really?
This is New York City - I told you no one would notice.
When I said I was in the mood for a spineless crustacean, I assumed you knew I meant a Republican.
Let's taunt the witch," you said. "It'll be fun," you said
Well, your profile did mention long walks on the beach...
I told you they wouldn't let you in with shorts on!
I'm going to need a little more than "I went to Maine with a buddy but the rest is a blur."
Something about this relationship doesn't seem kosher.
My mercury test came back positive.
Please stop saying that you’re on a roll.
I get your issues with a hot bath, but it wouldn’t kill you to take a shower.
You always find a way to avoid picking up the check.
Look, wear the claws if you want, but I’m not going to the party dressed as a piece of tail!
You get one wish and you go for lobster claws?
Your slow rollout of Halloween is annoying.
Well I feel like chicken but you don't see me sprouting feathers.
I just wish you were a little less shellfish at times
So,what were your first two wishes?
‘I thought you were joking when you said   
you clawed your way to the top!’
There was no need to freak out.  The melted butter was for your popcorn.
It's not me, it's you.
Yeah, but Edward Scissorhands hasn't been out of work for the last five years.
Gloria complains about her husband having two left feet. She has no idea how lucky she is.
Mobster, mobster, the party's theme was mobsters.
I attract nothing but bottom feeders.
Despite your exquisite taste, we’re just not compatible.
I TOLD you not to insult the magician!
I was just getting used to the scissors, Edward.
Don't you snap at me.
I am so embarrassed. I can't believe you're wearing shorts!
I don't know Michael. Why do YOU think we never hold hands any more?"
You need to give up this dream of yours to be a Proctologist, Jack.
I SAW you pinch her!
This isn’t what I meant when I said, “I could go for lobster.”
...I think I'm allergic to your family
You are, hands down, the most shellfish man I’ve ever met!
That's no excuse  for not texting me.
Being from Maine doesn't explain everything.
Couldn't you just use the salad tongs like everyone else?
You can forget about getting to second base
Must you always be so shellfish?
Oh, sure.  “Let’s just try the 3D printer.  What could go wrong?” you said!
Well, when a Genie offers you a wish, maybe you should be a bit more specific.
From now on, just let the Sommelier open the bottle.
If you do that again , the rubberbands go back on .
I don’t care if you don’t like how it feels. We’re using a rubber band.
Stop snapping at me all the time!
Not what I meant when I said you needed to break out of your shell.
Do you know how it makes me feel when you say that you’re a bottom feeder?
Crushing beer cans is not a super power.
I liked you better before you came out of your shell.
How exactly did your parents meet?
Well, next time we go to a party I'm bringing the rubber bands.
You can't deny it this time. I caught you red handed.
Admit it. Gene splicing is trickier than you thought.
Just for once could you try not to be so shellfish?
Of course I support your transition. It's just that I'm going to miss the lobster I fell in love with.
Don't even think about getting to second base.
It isn't gonna work Jim, but i appreciated the help with the jars.
What do you mean, how did I know you pinched her?
You could've wished for world peace...
Again, if they ask if you want to hold the baby, say "No thank you!"
Three wishes. You had three wishes.
I've waded too far out in the dating pool.
I don’t care that you can get things done in a pinch.
Your profile said Christian, not crustacean!
Mother always said that you’re a shellfish bastard.
Look, when your dating profile stated "must like lobster"..
All the super powers and you went with “lobster claws?”
Why is that impossible for you to grasp?
I guess what happens in Maine doesn't necessarily stay in Maine
You never return my texts.
Try that again and you'll be in hot water.
In medical school you may want to rethink gynecology as your specialty.
When they said you were clawed I thought that was your name.
White shorts. After labor day. I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
The rubber bands are going back on when we get home, mister!
Yeah I do think it should have been something you mentioned in your profile.
So I guess foreplay's out of the question
They're not going to let you in without your rubber band.
Next time don't ask to hold the baby.
You look ridiculous in those baggy shorts.Everyone is looking at you
So I  guess this means the hot tub is out.
So you're telling me that I'm crabby?
Pinch me again and I'll crack you.
When you said you have an "unusual reaction" to seafood, you could have been more specific.
And I thought you said your father was a Mobster...
What good are pincer implants if you still can't pick up a tab once in a while?
They all know you're from Maine, Bob.
Just once I'd like to see you pick up the check.
Don’t talk to me about boiling points...
No.... I don't mind the beard.
When you said 'My dad was a lobsterman, his dad was a lobsterman and I'm a lobsterman.', I thought you meant the family business.
I know you're angry.  Your claws always get red when you're angry.
You snap at me again and the rubber bands go back on.
Mobsters! I said I’m attracted to mobsters!
Then how did Marci get that rip in her skirt?
That was my nicest bra.
Well, you can forget about bases 2 and 3.
The problem with you, Joel,is that you never completely come out of your shell.
Did you get them the same place you got the crabs?
You are NOT the Catch of the Day.
Some catch you turned out to be.
Of course you can't help with laundry or dishes. How convenient.
Seek kelp.
I'm a good catch, too, you know.
Agh... I should've kissed the frog...
No, I do not want to see your mussels.
You know I hate that shirt.
How you think it makes me feel when you let the waitress butter you up like that?
Dating you would be getting into a gray area, according to my rabbi.
We’re finally meeting my Mother and you can’t even put on a tie?
You sort of buried the lead in your dating profile there, wouldn’t you say?
Seriously?! We are going to a nice restaurant and you're wearing shorts?
Why can't you just accept it--no one wants to hear you play the piano!
And don't think this won't land you in hot water!
Stop blaming Kafka...
I just don’t like people calling us Surf n Turf.
Why not just a tattoo like everybody else?
You better hope that skips a generation
And stop referring to me as the "Turf". It's so objectifying.
So you're sweet and tender on the inside huh?
You didn't have to ask to hold the baby.
You're becoming more and more shellfish.
'I come from a long line of lobstermen' usually refers to one's profession."
I just can't believe you wore shorts to meet my parents.
Please stop referring to us as "surf and turf"...
I cannot believe you are wearing shorts to meet my parents.
So, you're saying it's ME, I'm the crabby one?
All you seem to do lately is snap at everyone!
Anything else I should know about?
Well the doctor said if it lasts more than four hours than it's probably time to panic."
I just feel like I’m moving forward in this relationship, and you’re moving sideways.
Last time I take you out without your rubber bands.
On the phone I thought you said you were an ex-mobster.
Let's move to Maine, he says.  What could go wrong? he says.
Those shorts make you look ridiculous.
You’re not going to claw your way out of this one Jack. I caught you red handed!
That was my FAVORITE bra!”
When you told me you come from a long line of lobstermen, I didn't know you were being literal.
A thousand restaurants in New York and you had to recognize the main course.
No, I will not be Mrs. Claws for Halloween.
No, I don't want to go to your Halloween party as the turf.
Maybe next time when you meet a genie you won’t be drunk in a seafood restaurant.
You might want to elaborate on the 'transitioning' reference in your ad
Try that again and I’m bringing out the rubber bands.
Well, SOMEBODY must have pinched her!
I don’t care what they say about big claws.
OK, I'm sorry. I wish I'd never told you to grow a pair.
I don’t care if you live at the beach, shorts after Labor day isn’t done in Manhattan.
Bob just couldn't quite put his finger on the problem he was having with Julie.
You look ridiculous, Kevin. Who wears shorts with a sweatshirt?
Don't talk to me, you had  your claws all over her
Tonight was not the time to come out of your shell.
Don't complain to me. You're the one who bought shorts with buttons.
We’ve talked about this. You can take them off when you learn to put down the phone.
I just wish you would be less shellfish.
I just think you're being shellfish.
When you said "lobsterman," I thought you worked on a boat or something.
Well that was embarrassing!  You yelling murderer at the seafood restaurant.
You could have at least shaved to meet my mother for the first time...
Look - if I had known my assistant was also a genie I never would have yelled “Give me a hand - and make it snappy!”
Don't you even think about trying to get to second base!
If you're allergic, why do you keep ordering it?
You just can't let go of anything, can you?
Something other than a head shot on your profile wouldn't hurt.
You just had to snap at the waiter again didn’t you.
One day those things are gonna land you in a lot of hot water.
Somehow, it never feels like a playful pinch.
Why can't you just get tattoos like everybody else
...and when the guy in the turban asked, 'And what would you wish for?' I just thought he was the waiter.
My old-school Yankee parents would eat you alive.
At least your face looks like your pictures.
Pinch me one more time and you'll be swimming in butter.
I can't believe our friends think you look weird with a beard.
Not every problem can be solved with lemon and butter, John.
Tell it to Kafka.
Lamest.  Superpower.  Ever.
You are so shellfish!
And no more jokes about how I trapped you, or you're cooked.
And I suppose you want me to clarify something.
Stop calling it "our" fetish.
You couldn't settle for a tattoo or a simple piercing, no not you!
I don’t think I like us being referred to as ‘Surf and Turf!
Will you stop snapping at me?
Your profile only said you that you had clawed your way to the top.
Great, now I HAVE to get checked.
It's nice for once to go out with a man who isn't all hands.
Sorry, I’m kosher
How were you even able to swipe right?
I regret saying get a”better grip” on things.
Going forward safe sex will also include rubber bands.
You’re in hot water, mister.
You might've mentioned it in your profile.
Somewhere there's a lobster with hands.
I still say it was insensitive to ask if you wanted your water flat, sparkling, or boiling.
I knew Edward Sissorhands. Edward Sissorhands was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Edward Sissorhands.
No wonder you didn’t respond to my texts.
I get that you wanted to impress my father with a firm handshake, but for God’s sake, Ira, THINK!
You think you can just claw your way back into my life?
I know you clawed your way to the top but look what it's cost you.
Next time we are meeting new friends: wear the rubber-bands
So that's your excuse for not texting!
Nipple play is a hard no.
Well THAT was an embarrassing way to find out I'm allergic to shellfish.
Social media can be so miss leading......"when you said you were a lobsterman I thought it meant you worked in Maine"
Well, what would your fourth wish have been?
Something doesn't feel kosher about all of this.
First of all, asking a genie for some lobster claws is a really dumb wish. Secondly...
I'm the one who needs some buttering up Henry
I can’t believe you fell for that trap.
I thought you said you were SELFISH.
I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the hot tub.
That’s not what my father meant when he said you should grow a pair.
Your dating profile should mention that you need help with zippers.
Look, I like you... it just wouldn't be kosher
They said you'd be a real 'catch'"
We can go to my place, but first I need to grab some butter and a lemon.
I can't believe you brought those to the bris.
I'm sorry, Jimmy, I'm just not turned on by men with beards.
It's October. Those shorts are so embarrassing.
That “can’t reach my wallet” excuse is getting old.
I'm just saying... you could have wished for world peace
Well, honestly! When you said you had crab claws, I thought you'd be making dinner!
The restaurant I am taking you to advertises that they serve lobsters. I just wanted to make sure that we get served.
Would you please just TRY the hand cream?
I don’t care, you still should’ve picked up the tab.
I can't take you anywhere without your rubber bands.
And remember when we get there, don't scuttle.
Another restaurant we cannot go to.  Would it kill you to put on a tie?
I’m sure she didn’t mean anything by it—and besides, she’s right: would it really kill you to come out of your shell?
You should have been more specific when you said were a lobsterman.
I just don’t like holding hands in public. It’s nothing personal.
Brilliant first wish, Bob.  Now how are you going to rub the lamp?
Don't sidestep the question.
True... but you always get a seat on the subway.
Alright, alright, we won't get a hot tub.
Your 'help me with my fly' routine is getting old.
When I said 'grow a pair' that's not what I meant.
Yes, but I can hide my acrylic nails by folding my arms.
If you crack your knuckles one more time ...
Really? ...Shorts.
Just for once I'd like to order the bisque!
Foreplay is off the table
You shouldn't have taken that job at the nuclear power plant.
I told you that CBD oil wasn't FDA approved.
I know you looked at my phone, you left butter on it.
My mother warned me about dating men from Maine!
Last time I'll use a dating app with just head shots!
Everyone's always trying to butter you up.
No, a back rub would not help.
Not every handshake has to be firm."
You're sure you're out of wishes?
You can't just claw your way back into my good graces.
First, those were scissors and, second, you're no Johnny Depp.
You don't bring lobster claws to a clam bake; it's just rude.
I told you not to eat the genetically modified lobster.
You're in hot water when we get home.
Snap. Snap. Snap. And you never let anything go.
Bob, there's just something about you that's not kosher.
You didn’t even shave
No, I'm not upset because you're late.
It's not about the claws. It's about you being unwilling to change.
Your last name is actually Thermidor?!?!
I told you to stop reading Kafka
Your mother was wrong as usual. It didn't make you blind.
Only if those things vibrate.
They could have TOLD us they kept kosher before they invited us to dinner.
That's the last time we go out in public without your rubber bands
YOU feel trapped!!
Omg, we get it. You're from Maine.
Sure it makes it hard to text, but you could have called.
And now you understand the difference between "a lifetime supply of crab claws" and "crab claws for life."
You didn't think to mention them in your profile?
I just wish you weren’t so shellfish.
Don't expect me to butter you up.
Something about you isn't kosher.
Maybe leave the baby cheek-pinching to me next time.
Our first date and you're wearing shorts!!
I know all my friends think you're a real catch, but.  .  .
At least you don't have crabs
And definitely no foreplay.
Well, maybe I don't want to mate for life.
So I guess we have to sell the hot tub now, too?
He was a genii, not a waiter.  So when he said "Do you want the crab claws …"
Why don’t you just hold up a sign saying ‘it’s our first time in Maine’?
Nope... no foreplay.
I called you selfish not shellfish
Do it, again, and the rubber bands go back on.
You can be so shellfish at times!
And it wasn't fun trying to explain all the little claw marks to my doctor.
It just seems like you're becoming more shellfish...
Nothing like a bisque walk!
I'm only dating you during months with an R
Still, you didn't have to wear the bib to my mother's funeral.
Keep it up, you're on a roll.
Sorry. I don’t date bottom feeders.
Don’t you lie to me. You’ve been caught, well, red-handed.
We know you're from Maine.
Even if they offer, don't hold the baby.
When you said you were born into a long line of lobstermen, I didn't think you meant genetically.
No, I will not go to the Halloween party dressed as butter.
I can't put my finger on it...I just feel trapped.
No such claws in our pre-nup!
‘So who did pinch her backside?’
No, I will NOT dip you in butter.
They still hurt from last time.
When you said you were Claude, I sure didn't expect this!
I told you a thousand times, rock still beats scissor.
No, we're not spending another summer with your family in Maine.
Couldn’t you have just taken the bib?
Yes, it did fix your texting addiction, but I'd recommend changing therapists.
If you had a backbone, you'd have said something.
Kiss a frog, get a prince.  Kiss a lobster, get a pinch.
I don’t care what you say, Edward Scissorhands was not a documentary.
I don't know what I was thinking, Pincer is the worst dating app ever.
Well, I hope you do not have to use the bathroom.
When you said you had reactions to shellfish, I figured you meant the hives.
Don't look to me for sympathy. How do you think the lobster's doing with your hands?
You should have never agreed to participate in that study.
Shellfish asshole.
I see that you are not only dangerous but also not kosher.
You just had to impress my father with a firm handshake, didn't you?
OK, you are what you eat. I get it!
I broke up with my last boyfriend because he wouldn't stop cracking his knuckles.
You only care about yourself. You're just Shellfish.
You never answer my texts.
And this is your excuse for not texting me back?!
I wish you had mentioned in your profile that you have a beard and always wear shorts.
Well, I guess it's slightly better than your actually having crabs!
I’m not angry that you ate your children, Andrew… I’m just disappointed.
How many times have I told you not to pick children up!
I distinctly said I was interested in an upper crust Asian.
No, I don't want to see what you did with the third wish.
Well, you didn't have to snap at me.
Hey the good news? I have two more wishes left
When you said "I'm Claude now", I thought you meant you got a name change.
I caught you red-handed, and still you deny it!
I am going to have to get you declawed. It solved my problem with the cat.
I can’t believe you wore shorts to meet my parents
Shorts?! In October?!  People are staring!
But how was i to know that was your cousin on my plate!
I don't care if you identify as a lobster now; we can't afford that beach house.
OK. The psoriasis is gone. Big deal. Didn't you pay attention to the other side effects?!
What the hell did you put in those brownies?
You haven't been the same since we got back from Newberg.
I'm not wearing the bib until you put on the whole costume.
It's rubber bands for you when we get home.
Everyone is staring at us because you insist on wearing white after Labor Day
Don't give me that innocent look. I saw you pinch that waitress.
Of course I'm crabby, I caught you red-handed."
Well I’m sorry it triggers you, but I want to eat at the seafood place.
Don't think that this gets you out of washing dishes
You change anymore and you'll be in hot water.
I asked you not to wear shorts.
I admit they look great on you, but who wears red lobster claws to a black and white cartoon?
Would it kill you to put on a nice pair of rubber bands?
Is it too much to ask to put rubber bands on when we go out?
Something doesn't seem kosher.
No,not even LIGHT fondling until you've gone to the dermatologist.
You're in hot water now, mister.
Just go back to your man bun - it was surprisingly less stupid.
Isn't there some other way for you to stop looking at your phone so much?
I think I’d rather you just keep biting your nails.
You wasted money on a genetic profile just to learn the obvious.
They said you were a bottom feeder.  I thought they were kidding.
I don't want to be your Maine squeeze.
I think blowing your nose is the least of your problems.
It was all right, except for the foreplay.
I’m glad you’re coming out of your shell but do you have to snap at everyone?
I can’t believe you wore shorts!
I'm crabby? Look in the mirror, Rob.
As Gregor Samsa's cousin Howard awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself without opposable thumbs BUT with a hot girlfriend.
Should I call you my Maine squeeze?
What if we have children, will they be able to text?
Oh sure, but when I wanted to wear my mermaid tail I was the one who was nuts!
Oh well, at least you can walk forwards.
Why must we spend every vacation in Maine?
Sure thing, and I'm 1/16th Navajo
"You do that again and I'll get the rubber bands."
C'est fini, Jean-Clawed.
As long as we're clear that this date ends at first base.
You can unzip your own pants from now on.
You could have added 'literally' in your profile when you said you clawed your way to becoming partner in your law firm.
Never wear white after Labor Day!  Everyone’s staring.
Just my luck. I get a male with small claws.
You could have said something in your profile!
Is it really too much to ask that you wear slacks when we go out? I'm tired of everyone staring.
Honestly, Jared.  Shorts in October?
The on-line post says, "Loves seafood," but a little more specificity would have been welcome.
I’m not a mind reader, Bob. How could I have known you’d be terrified of steam baths?
For god's sake get a grip
Must you snap at everybody?
At least it’s not crabs.
Get a grip! I was just kidding about the hot tub.
My last boyfriend was a shrimp.
Let it go, Harold. All I ordered were the tails.”
I'm just saying it's weird when you order ONLY butter and no popcorn.
You seem a little crabby.
I'm a catch, too, you know.
You look different than you did in the tank.
I like you better when you’re crabby.
I can't see how it's any more difficult to put on a nice pair of slacks.
I'm just saying, you should be more specific on your dating profile than simply saying, "in transition"
Was it worth it for the free dinner at Red Lobster?
If my husband see us together, we're both going to be in hot water.
Removing big hands from preferences on my dating app.
When you promised me you were the type to "Claw your way to the top"  I didn't think you were quite so literal.
Really? After I found you under a rock, now  you're feeling trapped?!
And yet you can’t pick up the check.
Ugh. Another bris ruined.
It's just for the party, you said. You can turn the gene back off, you said. You think you're so smart.
Why did I buy so much butter? No reason.
I wish you’d grow a backbone.
No, I don’t think you should wait for your annual. It is worth the co-pay!
You never listen to me--I said I was a Presbyterian, not a Pescatarian.
You're gonna be in hot water when we get home, mister!
You know they won’t seat you if you wear shorts.
I just can't believe how impatient your guitar teacher was today.
To be honest, your shelfishness is claws for concern.
But nooo, you just HAD to try them on
Larry, I think we should take a little break from the foreplay.
Seriously, Gerald, Crocs were one thing, but this is RIDICULOUS.
Another night starring Mr. Parlor Tricks ends in tragedy.
I'm not crabby. You're crabby.
How about a nice hot bath and then some drawn butter?
Seriously Don.  How did you not know the try-out was for mobster!
Really Edward. Lobsterhands this time?
I thought you meant your name was Claude.
Nice try, but nobody thinks those things mean you have a big penis.
How dare your mother ask me to convert.
Stop being so shellfish.
They say "bottom dweller" a lot more than they say "cutting edge."
Claude you look ridiculous. I told you yesterday you can’t wear white after Labor Day.
Now I know why your dating profile said former marine.
"I was not trying to butter you up!"
And you're the one calling me crabby!?!?
Couldn't you have at least worn socks?
She had no business asking about your tail!
I’m not pointing fingers either.
You could always just stop biting your nails.
Well you know what? My hands are cold too, so just grow up.
I think it's time to return Kafka to the library.
I'm over your salary being determined by market price.
They're decorative oven mitts, Paul, not winter gloves.
You had to open every jar in the store, didn't you?
That oughta keep you from picking your nose.
I mean, you don't see me wearing my California Roll hat when we go out for sushi.
That's the third bra you've ruined this week.
When you said you had pincers, I assumed you meant dobermans!
I still don't understand why you refuse to wear socks.
Sorry Bert, this isn't working out.  I am tired of being referred to as Mrs. Claws.
My mother will hate those shorts.
Jeff we talked about this. You have to wear the full suit or you just look dumb
Can’t you just get a tattoo like the rest of the guys?
When your dating profile indicated ‘lobsterman,’  I thought you meant your profession!
That’s the last time I’m helping you with your zipper!
And don't try and deny it. I saw you pinch that waitress"
Do we have to visit Maine for every vacation?
That’s still no reason not to shake my father’s hand.
It would just be nice to have help putting on my necklace.
Acceptance can only go so far, I refuse to wear a bib in bed.
My therapist thinks I’ve got an overactive imagination.
So, anything new in the CRISPR research?
I’m the one who’s always crabby?
You're not exactly a perfect catch.
The Seafood Festival was 3 days ago, Jake. Time to move on.
I just think you should at least get tested.
When you described yourself as a lobsterman, I expected a salty hunk from Maine.
How many wishes do you have left?
Sure, everyone says they're willing to claw their way to the top, but can you stand the heat?
I bring up my ex once, and the claws come out...
I can’t believe you’re wearing those shorts to meet my parents.
When I said 'pinch me,' I didn't mean it literally.
Why I ever considered dating a bottom feeder, I'll never know.
We're stuck in this, for butter or worse.
And yes, you're still in hot water.
Look on the bright side. You no longer bite your nails.
'I'll get the glassware down' he says...
Need I remind you–last time we held hands I ended up in the ER.
It's not the sarcasm--it's the air quotes.
My mother always has to bring up her allergy to shellfish when we visit.
Sometimes you can be so shellfish.
It’s me or the 3D printer.
You aren't wearing the wedding ring again.
I’m just saying it would be nice to order the lobster just once without you judging me.
I can’t decide if I am more mortified as a vegan or a fashionista.
Hands down, the profile pic is always misleading.
I told you I prefer the tail!
It's not you, it's me. I don't like holding hands.
Yeah Roger, nipples *are* pretty sensitive. Just don"t let it happen again.
If you didn't want to hold my hand you could've just said so."
You're OK. It's the handsy guys I can't stand.
I don’t care Bob. You’re still spineless.
I'm an independent woman, Larry, I'm not trying to trap you.
NO, to every intimate thought you might be having.
I'm NOT helping you with zippers.
You looked different in the tank"
So tell me again how you're going to claw your way to the top.
All you ever talk about is clawing your way to the top.
Frankly, I prefer to be tickled.
So you're trans crustacean?
Seriously?  You had one wish.  And this is what you came up with?!
You call ME crabby?!?!?
I just don't understand why you have to be so shellfish.
There's something fishy about your mother's past.
Oh please!  I caught you red-handed.
I just don’t like how other women look at you like they want to dip you in melted butter.
Do you need to tell EVERYONE your first name is Santa?
You embarrass me so much every time  we go out Todd...Cargo shorts? Really?
Don't you dare pinch my ass!
Well, I think she was out of line for saying they looked delicious.
You know, sometimes you're so shellfish.
So what else can you do besides open jars?
It's not you, it's me. I don't date Genetically Modified Organisms
I told you to take Benadryl before we ordered.
Just because they serve seafood doesn't mean it's someone you knew.
That joke about being a gynecologist stopped being funny a long time ago.
Oh, I guess I'M the crabby one?!
Sorry, but it's not what I meant when I said I was looking for a catch.
Well, there was no reason to snap at me!
They may be warm but they LOOK ridiculous.
So you think you can just claw your way back into my life.”
You’ll do in a pinch.
Sometimes it’s like you’ve been living under a rock.
I am from Maine, why do you ask?
I am positive I said "claw foot".  And I was talking about a bath tub.
You had ONE wish!!! Only ONE!!! And all you could think of was FOOD????!!!!
Didn't I tell you I keep kosher?
You've changed.
I'd love to see the lobster that got your hands!
So... You think You're on a roll, Eh ?
Anything else huge and pink?
Why must you put those on every time we visit my parents?
What happened to the man who treated me with kid gloves?
Not quite what I was expecting when your dating profile said "a part of me yearns for the open sea."
We are not naming our son Thermador.
Hopefully, this will keep you from picking you nose!"
Well who else could have given me crabs?
If they keep setting your bail at the market price per pound, I’m not going to pay it again.
It's just...I think you should have mentioned it in your profile...
Why do you always think that I trapped you?
Yeah, I'm upset. You were caught red handed!
Red-handed means different things to different people
Why don't you ever return my texts?
I am not holding your claw till you put the rubber band back on.
No, I never ever said I thought Edward Scissorhands was cute.
'Don't be silly,' you said, 'genetically modified food is perfectly safe.'
I guess you are what you eat.
Because I'm allergic to shellfish, that's why.
Maybe next time you'll listen to me and read the FULL list of side effects.
So don't order the bisque. You didn't have to make such a scene.
If you touch me again I'll suck out your hand.
Mention my sister again and you'll be in hot water.
It’s taken a while, but you’re finally coming out of your shell!
At least you're more of a gentleman than my last boyfriend... 
he was a real octopus.
We never go out any more. I feel like you’re turning into a hermit.
Well, the frog just needed a KISS!
Charlie the Tuna says you take the dive in the third round - got it?
Dave, once again, please don't click-clack your claws along with the music. It's SO embarrassing. The whole restaurant was looking at us!
And stop referring to me as “my little buttercup”
Frankly, I'm shell shocked.
Technically, you didn't catch me red-handed.
I am your wife, Brandon. And not even I have a clue what you're protesting.
No, you’re snappy...
You just don't seem very evolved.
When you said you came from a long line of lobstermen, I didn't think you meant genetically.
The invitation specifically said "No Shorts"!
Not even to first base, buddy!
When I told you I like lobster this is not what I meant!
I can't believe we're going to Le Bernardin, and you're wearing shorts.
I know I said I would be supportive of your transformation, but I’m not going to call you “Claw-dia”.
Well, at least it’s not crabs.
I can't believe you are wearing white after Labor Day
You have a real shellfish streak, Rob."
You want a what job?
Really, Jeremy, you at least could have shaved and wore pants; this dinner is important to me!
Every time you hold me I feel I need to smash you with a hammer.
Look Crabclaws, I dated Edward Scissorhands, and you’re NO EDWARD SCISSORHANDS!
Sometimes I need to be buttered up, too.
We just started dating, you should be wearing a rubber band.
Button your own shorts from now on!
If you didn't like holding hands, you could have just said so.
I swear to God, if you quote T.S. Eliot one more time...
No Bob,I don't know how to "dress up as butter."
Do your new gloves pinch?
I'm told you must be at least 3 1/4 inches to keep, and can’t be over 5 inches.
You know damn well my parents are strictly kosher...
Definitely not tonight!
This wasn't exactly the infidelity claws I was thinking of.
Now I'M steaming.
Well the meet-up profile said C-L-A-U-D-E.
It's over.  I've had enough of your shellfishness.
I can't stand it! Everyone just assumes we're from Maine"
Pinch me one more time and the rubber bands are going back on.
You’re so bisque averse.
Must you make a scene every time you see a distant cousin on the menu?
I bet you’d love to get your claws into her.
I don't care what you say, Raymond. We're not going to Maine this year.
Don't even think about it.
It’s like you are always trying to embarrase me in front of my friends. I’ve told you before, those shorts look bad on you.
Touch me again and you'll be up to your wrists in butter.
kEEP YOUR  CLAWS OFF ME, HEAR?!
Did you have to embarrass me by wearing shorts?
Well, well, Mr. Wandering Hands! That will teach you to goose a witch!
I don't care...you're still going to wear a wedding band!
We finally meet a genie, and you have to start quoting T.S. Eliot!
I support your transition Tom, but you have to at least compromise about the garlic butter.
I need you to know that I'm not kosher.
Shorts? You're wearing shorts on a first date while I'm wearing a dress?
So we’re agreed - we’ll skip right past foreplay.
Well, your profile picture wasn’t a full body shot, either.
That was your last wish Todd! What happened to world peace?
I just don't like you as much since you've come out of your shell!
I was worried when the doctor said there may be side effects, but I feel fine. How about you?
No! I won't help you 'pee'.
Well I don't know what kind of job you think you're going to get now but you're finished as a masseuse
If you pinch me... you’ll be in such hot water!
Yeah, I know my Tinder profile says likes seafood, but really?
Your profile didn't mention that you're Republican.
That's not what I meant when I told you to get a grip.
. . . and no more clicking along with the castanets!
I knew you didn’t want to shake hands with my ex, but this is ridiculous!
So.....Who got the tail?
No sex until you molt.
Remember to stay out of the hot tub.
You're an adult, I shouldn't have to tie your shoes.
How do you even swipe right with those?
I can't believe you regrew them.
My profile clearly states I have a shellfish allergy.
Sandy Claws? Seriously?
So, why the slow boil?
...and you think I’m crabby in the morning!?
Any excuse not to hold hands in public!"
I was expecting this night to go a little differently when you said you had big hands.
When did you become so shellfish?
I told you we shouldn’t have spent the summer in Maine.
Of all the superhero's you could have chosen and you pick Lobster Man?
Let me be clear, foreplay is not an option.
Hands down, you are the most shellfish person I know!
All that money for dental school down the drain.
I'm sorry, but who wears long sleeves and shorts?
You’re becoming so shellfish”
Before we go any further, you need to know I was raised orthodox.
No, Brian, they are not going to be the next big thing.
I told you they'd grow back
Which part of “get your claws off me” didn’t you understand?
For once, I would like to vacation somewhere other than Maine.
And you think I’m being crabby today?
Of all the radioactive creatures to have been bitten by...
I thought you said you got tested for crabs
Gosh Barry, sometimes you can really be a shellfish jerk.
I can't believe you forgot the rubber bands again!
And what about all that money we wasted on piano lessons...
I have asked you repeatedly to stop snapping at me.
You will do Anything  to avoid foreplay, won’t you??!
I preferred it when your hands were just clammy.
No, butter will not make me like you any better.
Oh, and another thing ..."lobster-man" is the dumbest idea for a superhero I have ever heard
And you get all upset when I spend a lousy forty bucks to have my nails done.
No one claps that loud at an Aquaman movie.
Next time wear the whole thing.
You’re too old to have to claw your way to the top.
You are not going to claw your way to the top in shorts.
Why'd I bother taking the rubber bands off if you still won't hold my hand?
I just thought by now you would have come out of your shell.
Let's find you a good pair of rubber bands."
Tell me again!  What was the bet?
How is this less embarrassing than a doggie bag?
I keep kosher.
You didn’t have to snap at me.
For the last time, I'm not calling you "CrawDaddy".
Your profile said you were a real catch.
I told you not to wear shorts to dinner
So what was it like growing up in Maine?
No need denying it. You were caught red handed!
For the last time, I will not dip you in melted butter.
Pinch me one more time and  you’re going directly into the steamer.
We don't need the whole costume, you said. Minimalism, you said. Suggestive irony, you said. And then Herb and Sheila win everything with a horse costume.
So I assume seafood is out of the question?
So when Lois first accused you of pinching her, you said ‘that’s impossible.’ Now you’re saying it might have happened??
I'm getting tired of your excuses for not doing the dishes.
Okay, fine.  Yes, you look like your profile picture but it was still misleading.
We never get to go to my parents in Indiana...it's always back to your parents in Maine for Thanksgiving
No one wears crustacean anymore.
Well, I'm boiling too.
Sometimes a woman wants to open to her own walnuts.
You were being a bit crabby back there.
Just my luck to fall for the guy who’s least likely to give good back rubs.
That's what you get for teasing the wizard about his small hands.
You wasted your last wish on lobster claws?
My mother warned me about bottom-feeders like you.
If they were any color other than orange …
'You'll do in a pinch' is not what I was hoping to hear."
That's no excuse for not picking up the check.
No, I will not wear a bib.
Because "old Gypsy woman" is ageist, ethnically insensitive, and misogynistic, that's why I'm taking her side.
Next time, spare me the foreplay.
You should have thought about that before you made your last wish
Why are you in such a crabby mood?
I told you this would not get you a discount at Red Lobster.
So ”I'd love lobster claws” was your 3rd wish?
Figure a new way to pee..I'm not your mother...
Your mother really is a witch, isn't she?
When they said "independent clause," didn't you ask them to spell it?
You didn’t need to butter up my mother like that.
So how, exactly, did you manage to swipe right?
No! You're on your own in the Restroom!
And I'm sick of sending text after text with no response.
I just want to hold hands in public.
Anything ELSE you want to tell me about your "business trip" to Vegas?!
No, no, second base is so not happening.
I warned you that wearing shorts without socks on such a chilly day would bring unwanted attention.
I don't think I should have to quit eating lobster just because we're dating.
If you get the matching shoes, it's divorce
Pinch me one more time and I’ll have those claws wired shut!
Maybe I'm just tired of being referred to as Mrs. Claws.
No, you may not touch my nipples.
I caught you red handed Bob, it's over
It's not you, I'm just not into holding hands in public.
Why can't you be more like your brother Ed with those sexy scissor-hands?
As your attorney,  I want you to understand that you misunderstood me when I said that we need to replace the clause.
No
I don't want to hold your Hand!
On your tindr profile, you had rubber bands on.
The claws are impressive. Its the accent I don't get.
I told you that I was wearing a dress and YOU decide to wear shorts.
Claus is spelled CLAUS.  Next year, I will order the costumes.
I said the theme was “Mobsters”!
Tell the Kafka Institute we want our money back.
You just keep getting yourself into hot water, Paul.
Mister Big Shot.  Kafka, you had to say, who reads Kafka any more?
I fought the claw, and the claw won.
How can you even try to deny pinching our hostess's butt, when you were caught red-handed?
No way dude...I mean, if you were Johnny Depp I'd think about it, maybe.
If you think this means you never have to do the dishes again, think again mister.
I just wanted to talk and you come out with your claws on.
You expect me to believe you weren't clawing that other woman?
We're putting the rubber bands back on.
You just keep your claws to yourself!
You know, sometimes you can be so shellfish.
That's the third buffet we were thrown out of.
Well, my nightmare is getting married somewhere OTHER than New England.
I wished you take off that stupid human outfit.
Stop telling me to get a grip.
OK.  Cured your finger snapping.  Now we’ll work on your gum popping.
There's more to life than just being good in a pinch.
No I won’t pick your nose.
But I am trying to break out of my shell.
NOT in your eharmony profile.
They're not the most stylish of gloves, but they'll do in a pinch.
My suggestion, skip ballet lessons and try Flamenco.
Why does it always have to be about you?
You're claws weren't the issue ... it was your stupid shorts.
How many times have I told you.
You are what you eat
What now, a high two?
How were you able to swipe right in the first place?
Would it kill you to wear gloves?
I'm so tired of your excuses for making  me pay.
I suppose if you have them removed, they'll just grow back...
It’s that they’re orange. Who in their right mind wants to look orange?
Don’t get snappy with me, Mister!
Larry couldn't wait to get his claws on Jill, especially after she buttered him up a little.
I just get tired of the "butter wouldn't melt in your mouth" joke...
The rubber bands go right back on the next time you pinch someone again."
Try groping some woman now!
We’ve tried your specialists, now will you see a marine biologist ?
No honey, they weren’t wondering why you wore shorts.
So much for snap chat!
No, I'm steamed...
When you said in your profile you were really in to shellfish... you can imagine what I assumed.
I suppose you'll want your own pool now.
I told you that guy wasn’t a real dermatologist
You lost the key to the handcuffs, you couldn't untie the rope, and now this?
I'm not saying I would've swiped left, I just don't understand how you swiped right.
How was I supposed to know she really was a sorceress?
Don't you think you're being a little shellfish?
I’m not kink-shaming, I just don’t want to wear a bib.
For the last time Jason; the lobster mac and cheese was the special!  She was not making fun of your claws!
Don't be silly, of course no one will notice.
No, Steve, you can’t just claw your way back into my life.
Well that's the last time we visit my parents without your rubber bands.
You knew we were meeting my parents for lunch, you couldn't have even put on pants?
That has got to be the most ironic Viagra side effect yet.
You look ridiculous in those shorts.
... and how come everyone but you knows the Goldbergs keep kosher
I wish you wouldn't be so shellfish.
I love you, Roger, but the pinching has to stop.
For the last time I said that I loved Lobster tails.
I know your profile said you're from Maine but this was a surprise.
Walking shorts and a pullover, you call that dressing up?
Well dirty boy,  when we  get home what  do you say I draw a nice hot bath for you.
Well I can tell you this Mister; the elastics are going back on!
I notice you never pick up the check
Yeah, I'm the one who's always crabby.
I told you not to trust any surgeon for your carpal tunnel syndrome!
They were on sale??  That's all you have to say?
No, not even if you bathe in butter.
I don't care if it is a B52's concert, you aren't going dressed like that.
Take them off. That's only cool in Boston.
I'm sure this is another excuse for not touching me
You really don’t understand why we can’t go to third base???
It not the claws that bother me. It’s all the mercury.
The kids are expecting Santa Claus, not Lobster Claws, you boob!
Sorry! Still no excuse for leaving the toilet seat up.
...and don't start sidestepping!
It is not going to help us get a table.
You and your allergies.
Those shorts make you look like a dork.
I want "pinchy-pinchy-pinchy" out of your vocabulary.
You would think that you could pick up a check once in awhile.
Let's see if you can control yourself without the rubber bands.
You're just shellfish!
What I just did for you in that restroom will haunt me forever.
Seems like a pretty lame excuse to not cuddle.
You could have asked for the tail.
It's not going to be much of a relationship if I have to tie your shoes every time.
All I'm saying is that I think you should have mentioned that you used to work in Fukushima in your profile.
How can I expect you to be "more hands-on" when you're so shellfish.
It's obvious you didn't catch it from me.
I just feel like you’re constantly snapping at me.
So, you're transitioning into a crustacean?
I get it John, you want to move back to Maine
Don’t pretend you’ve never heard it before: You’re a shellfish lover.
I keep texting you and texting you. No reply. Don’t tell me you never got them!
He has to stop referring to me as his “Maine squeeze”.
Your shoplifting days are over.
If I ever get another chance, I'm gonna kiss an enchanted frog!
I told you my Mom is allergic to shellfish, but you just had to hug her.
I don’t care if everyone in your family, genus, AND phylum mates for life; I want a divorce!
I said keep your claws off of me.
I wanted pizza, but, no, you had to try the new seafood place doing molecular gastronomy.
I'm boiling mad!
Now I see why you chose a headshot for your Tinder profile
You can't just claw your way to the top.
‘Good in a pinch’ isn’t good enough.
``We should have left as soon as they brought 
out the bibs and butter sauce.''
I could replace you with a nutcracker.
Look on the bright side, at least you can crack walnuts.
You are just a shell of the man you used to be.
Are you sure you won’t see The Nutcracker with me?
We can’t compromise on this, the claws are just as bad as the whole suit.
Are you sure the dinner invitation said to just bring yourself and a big pot?
Thats the last time you're going to embarrass me with that 'she's already tried the lobster' joke.
Must you insist on salt water at every restaurant?
Frankly, I'd prefer you bit your nails.
Every time I criticize you, you snap back.
Pinch me in public again and I'll boil you.
Halloween is not one of the High Holidays, Steve. And shellfish?!
I never should have taken off the rubber bands.
Hearing ‘he looks half-mobster and may be a bit selfish’ raised red flags, but I should've paid closer attention.
I know you're self-conscious, but for the last time you do not need a nose job!
They warned you the plate was hot.
I completely misunderstood the ‘clause’ in the pre-nup.”
What I need most is you treat me with a pair of kid gloves.
Look - Crocs were ugly but practical. Your invention... not so much.
Marry someone with soft hands," Mom said. But,would I listen
I thought you were being metaphorical in your dating profile, when you said you clawed your way to the top.
You're not touching me without wearing your rubber bands!
I like visiting your mom - but your dad's such a crab...
You know, what was funny in college is less so
        now that you're Secretary of Defense.
Really? That’s how you think you can claw your way to the top?
Look, it's not you. It's me and my allergies.
I should have left you in the tank
You're not getting those things anywhere near my clam!
I can't believe you said I trapped you.
I GET it!  You're from Maine.
I say one little thing, and your claws come out!
So your third wish was to have giant lobster claws?
Couldn't you tell she was just buttering you up?
IF we ever try that again, wear your octopus hands!
I know they mean a lot to you, I just wish you didn't have to always wear them every time we go out.
I know I said I wanted someone of mixed parentage.
I should have married Eddie Scissorhands.
Don't worry my Dermatologist has seen everything"
And after the Hell you gave me for cutting my hair short.
Look, they caught you red-handed, so as your counsel I say we accept the plea offer.
Now both of us are crabby.
Don't lie to me.  I caught you . . . well, you know.
What do you mean, ‘playful pinching’ is in your DNA?
Really? You didn't think "I have lobster claws for hands" was worth mentioning in your Tinder bio?
Touch me and you will be baked and stuffed in no time.
I thought your dating profile said  selfish, not shellfish”
That waitress was really buttering you up!
If you don't want to hold my hand, you can just say so.
You grow a tail and we’re through.
I'll just *bet* that slut Suzanne "loves claw meat"!
We need to think of something that will make you stand out ... something that can make you seem unique on these college applications
If you weren't such a great back scratcher I would leave you
I've gotta be honest, when the app asked if I was open to dating half-animals, I was at least expecting a centaur or a satyr.
My ex was hung like a horse.
Becky's text said "mobster."
"Ooh! Exciting!" I thought.
Yes, I did say 'claws for concern.'
At least Edward Scissorhands could cut hair well.
It is NOT "just like The Little Mermaid."
And don't think I didn't notice you eyeing that woman with the large dorsal fin.
Stop complaining, Harold, they're a valid stipulation of the restraining order.
Caught you red handed!
The last guy I dated was a total octopus. Now this!
I said get dressed for dinner not dress "as" dinner Harold.
I swear, Ted, I thought you were mature enough to go out without your rubber bands.
At this point in our relationship I don’t care how stupid you look. You just better pay very close attention when you get into that voting booth and don’t click “Trump” by mistake.
Would it kill you to dress up before meeting my parents?
For the millionth time, you're my Maine man!
Jazz hands were fine! I should never have said a word.
For God’s sake, Henry, give it a rest.  You’re never getting into dental school.
Oh sure, it's fun for you, but just stay away from my nipples.
One more time,. and it's the rubber bands!
When I say "Keep your hands off me!" don't ask why.
Your little stunt just got us permanently
banned from all Red Lobsters.
I thought you were getting a tattoo!
Couldn't you have just settled for the Maine t-shirt instead?
I applaud your support for sustainable lobster fishing, but couldn't you have just worn the t-shirt?
Now who's being crabby?
You’re telling me you read ALL the possible side effects before you take your medicine?
How can you be so shellfish?
This isn't working. I don't care how much of a "catch" you are!
I don't care if we get free butter at the bodega, take them off.
Why didn't you TELL me you had a shellfish allergy?
Well you told me to wear something snappy...
You can't claw your way out of this one, Jeffery
I can't believe you're wearing jorts.
Foreplay is out of the question
I can only imagine what Seinfeld would do with this.
Admit it, Steve - I caught you redhanded.
Easy for you to say, "get a grip."
You didn’t need to snap at my mother.
I suppose it’s an improvement, Edward.
Mrs. Newberg is not amused.
I just don't see why your mom had to snap at me like that.
Can we walk sideways for once??
Most people only have to get their cat declawed.
I thought you said you got a job AT Red Lobster, not a job AS a red lobster.
I keep telling you, “Never wash your hands with hot water,” but do you listen?
My profile says that I like hot tubs, butter, and Maine vacations, and you swiped right?
Even if you were hungry, you shouldn’t have told the genie “I want lobster claws!”
I warned you the #Me Too movement has methods of revenge.
It’s a good thing you’re not the President.
I'm NOT buttering you up!
Why do you always have to call attention to yourself when we go out? I told you that wearing shorts in October would make you too conspicuous.
The claws are bad enough. But those horrid shorts!
Of course they are sore...
Wouldn't it be a lot less weird just to wear a "Proud to be a Mainer" T-shirt?
Porn Addiction Recovery
You’re quite a catch, but I wonder sometimes whether you’re a keeper.
Once again, your claws have gotten you into hot water.
So what, we’ll just never go bowling?
Don’t touch me!
Yes, I don't notice your receding hairline as much.
Maine men are the worst; you'll latch on to anyone.
Seriously, you need me to spell it out?
There's no such thing as Lobsterman.
Beautiful wife, enormous mansion...why did you waste your third wish on lobster hands?
I'm serious this time, John. If you pinch me one more time, the rubber bands are going back on!
You did it again Larry, you got crabs and now I have to go get tested.
I don't know what it is, you've just been acting really crabby lately.
I thought you said, "Claud."
Take off the gloves, Bob. Why can't you just say 'I'm allergic to shellfish,' like everyone else does?!
Who is she trying to impress with all that butter and lemon?
You could at least try reaching for the bill.
I warned your sister I shouldn't hold the baby.
and you wonder why I'm in a crabby mood?!
God, what is up with you damn Kafkas.
I'm sorry - when I said I was excited to meet a lobsterman I was expecting something different.
I thought he said, "Do you agree to the clause?"
This is why I don't take you nice places.
And if you try that again you won't like what happens to another body part.
You can't claw your way out this time. I caught you red handed.
And now we are banned from pottery class too!
If they ask how we met, let me do the talking.
Damn it Winston... Get this through your thick head. I ‘m the one who takes off my bra from now on, and that’s final.
Mother warned me you would never change.
I don't know, John. There's something fishy about the whole thing.
I don't like having them pinched!
Just because something is on sale, doesn’t mean you should buy it.
I can’t believe you wore shorts to the party! Didn’t you notice everyone staring?
Never date a guy named Kafka.
I'm sorry. It's just that when you told me about your mutant super power, I kind of pictured you as Wolverine.
No, muggers won’t be a problem, but if we meet an octopus you’re going to be in trouble.
Please tell me this is the last of your elaborate ploys to avoid helping around the house!
This is not what I meant by "evolving".
Well that was un-clawed for.
I get that it's a medical condition, but I just want to go bowling sometimes!
You’re just too shellfish, Brad.
Louis, I was so embarrassed when everyone was staring at us.  I told you not to wear shorts to dinner!
Seafood allergy! Who knew?
What happened to your rubber bands THIS time?
You say you it wasn't a pinch.  I say it was a pinch.
I told you not to eat that gas station sushi
Sure, but when's the last time you actually crushed a mollusk?
... and every time you made that annoying clacking sound with your fingers, the Rosenthals just looked at each other.
If you want me to be responsible for my own orgasms, just say so.
No I'm not being crabby, you're being crabby!
Day one of the worst honeymoon ever.
Well, I thought it wouldn't kill you to at least try to pick up the check.
Look who's calling who crabby!
I just don't understand why you won't wear the tail.
Told you your hands needed sunscreen too.
I, Claudius
Yes, my issue with your mother IS the cross species divide.
I know you don't like to wear them, but would it kill you to remember your rubber bands the next time you meet one of my friends?
After Edward Scissorhands you’d think I’d learn. But nooo....
I still can't believe you were able to put that shirt on.
I'm tired of watching you try to claw your way to the top.
But nooooo, you just had to eat that GMO crab meat!
$300 for the biggest lobster they had just so you could wear the claws?  Really?
We're not buying the hot tub.
I know you are angry at the rabbi but don't you think you are taking this a bit too far?
You're not touching me with those things tonight.
That's it. I'm done online dating.
And you still haven’t clawed your way to the top?
So the old ‘can’t get to my wallet’ bit strikes again.
I just wanted to look different. Everyone has a beard these days.
Hard to believe I thought you were quite a catch all those years ago.
I just don't see "Lobster-Man" as a viable superhero.
It’s inappropriate for Yom Kippur.
First Edward Scissorhands, now you.  I really need to change my Match profile.
You should have known the party required tails.
Bill, I know it's high fashion in Maine, but you are in New York
I wish I"d never taken off your rubber bands.
I dunno. Scissorhands at least would have been useful!
Just tell me that you did NOT pinch that woman on the butt.
You know what they say about big hands.
Now that we've broken up you will have to get someone else to tie your shoes for you.
I’m just going to pop in and grab a couple of pounds of butter for after the surgery.
You have serious issues with letting things go.
... and if you touch me again, I'll change another part of your anatomy!
It's not you, I just don't like back rubs.
I can't believe you think I am crabby.
It offered us three wishes, and you still threw it in the pot!
OK it was funny the first time you pinched me.
I sense a trap.
No, I'm not really into holding hands and long walks on the beach.
No, you said, "Look at these huge claws, that means something else must be pretty big."
I didn’t expect this when you started clawing your way to the top.
Brad, when the Devil says "sign here" you ALWAYS look for the hidden claws!
I'm tired of hearing your shelfish excuses.
It’s always two steps sideways and one step back in this relationship.
Just keep your red hot mitts off me.
Why would you think you got the crabs from ME?
When you bragged about 'clawing your way to the top', this is not what I had in mind.
And I guess you’ll want to replace our wedding ring with a rubber band?
On the app, you didn’t say you were from Maine.
What? Do you think I should have gone with the tail instead?
So this is how you plan to claw your way to the top?
The last guy I dated was such an octopus.
I didn't know he was your cousin."
We should've never bought the generic fish oil pills.
My profile specified strictly kosher.
Sure, I was interested—when I thought you said ‘part mobster.’
Why would you think I'm just trying to butter you up?
If you forget your rubber bands again, you're history.
The claws I can live with, but the butter and garlic cologne is a dealbreaker!
I'm just saying that it would have been nice to mention in your tinder profile
You shellfish bastard.
I just wish you'd stop molting.
You’re shellfish.
Stop cracking your knuckles.
Don’t apologize.  You are literally spineless.
Don’t you dare try to butter me up
Yes, Sebastian, sometimes I do have regrets.
You'll always be a bottom feeder, Frank!
You never want to hold hands
Yes you’re “walking and talking” but the hospital’s 3D printer still has bugs!
I knew Santa Claus, and those are not Santa's claws.
So when you meet my parents, it's fist pumps or hugs only.  Are we clear?
Tie your own shoes for a change.
Nobody cares if you are from Maine.
Pinch me again and I’ll boil you alive!
Your dating profile had been appealing when you stated that you weren't a micro-managing, hands-on guy.
My friends warned me that you were shellfish, but I guess I chose not to see it.
A dentist! That's what you decided as a profession?
This was not what I was expecting from your dating profile comment ‘native of Maine’.
And don't come crawling back.
Good luck trying to piss, genius.
0h come on now, your name can’t really be Claude.
Well, I guess it's better than you having crabs.
I told you to stop being so crabby!
I thought you'd be happy that I finally came out of the clawsit.
You DON’T ask for a piece of tail!
This is the last time I help you look. If you can't hold on to your phone, then don't use it.
You knew the genie only gave you one goddamn wish!
I will not go anywhere with you until you get rubber bands for those claws.
If this doesn't stop your nasty habit nothing will.
No - my nipples still hurt from last night.
Well Edward Sissorhands got a big role.
I’d invite you back to my place but I’m not sure what we’d do.
I can’t believe you wore shorts to brunch with my Mom.  And you could have at least TRIED to pick up the check.
No Mark, I said he was Croatian.
Not everything is about your hands, you know.
For once, I would have preferred being pawed.
I said, ‘Eat too much lobster, you’ll turn into a lobster.’ But did you listen to me? No...
Just how do you expect me not to mention them
And you call me shellfish?
Except for some side effects, dear, I really like your new hand lotion.
Couldn't you have asked for a doggy bag?
You have a hard time letting go.
I prefer the right to bear arms.
What do you mean I'm the crabby one?
Keep your hands to yourself!
And you can forget about 2nd Base.
My mother warned me about someone so shellfish.
I just wish you'd stop snapping at me.
You ruined all the romance of the couples bath with your shrieking.
Well, good luck regenerating this relationship.
Well, I warned you not to try them on!
Yes, this is going to affect your piano playing!
That’s it, I’m gonna start keeping kosher.
On Nantucket, you were marginally acceptable. Fifth Avenue . . . not so much.
I knew you were from New England.
And what's your first name, Mr, Newburg?
Over time her crabbiness really began to grow on him.
Can't believe I caught you red-handed pinching that woman's bottom!
You don't have to be so snippy about it.
I appreciate your coming out of your shell a bit, but I still want to know who helped type your dating profile.
It wasn't funny what you did with that gentleman's bib.
I liked it better when you were all lobster.
Well, I guess we're not going to be eating Chinese...
This is a deal breaker...I told you I was Kosher.
Do you always have to be so shellfish?
I told you we shouldn't buy a home next to that nuclear reactor!
On Match you said you were Jewish!
I'm simply not going to let you claw your way back into my life!
You just had to shake my fathers hand, didn’t you?!
I do not want to hear "I can't get at my wallet."
You assured me you’d be done moulting before Dr. Earles party tomorrow
I'm just saying ...foreplay just isn’t the same anymore
If you had asked I would have told you to stick with the man bun.
Well, congratulations, genius scientist, but until you find an antidote the engagement is over.
For the last time, I am not going to let you claw your way back into this family
I mean...you should have, at least, mentioned it in your profile.
This isn't working Larry. I'm going back to ham-fisted Hank.
I stated clearly in my profile that I was allergic to shellfish.
I'm through!  You'll have to find someone else to deal with your zipper.
Meet my parents? Totally not kosher.
I'm sick and tired of being snapped at.
Well, maybe you should mention your shellfish allergy on your profile page!
Pull something like that again, and we’re going to find out if they grow back.
Just once I'd like to go out to dinner with friends without your mentioning that they're blue before boiling.
Charles, either you wear the rubber bands or our relationship is over.
Would it have killed you to wear rubber bands before meeting my parents.
Don't try to deny that you pinched my sister - I caught you red-handed!
I told you sooner or later you'd be caught redhanded, but this is ridiculous.
I told them I wanted to meet someone who wasn’t completely selfish, not shellfish!
So what's your super power?
Maine lobsterman. Well, La Di Da!
The lobster claws are fine, but I truly hate your beard.
I want to fit in too, but why not adopt a Boston accent instead?
Hear me out . . .
They say Lobsters mate for life!
We met on J-date, of course I thought you were kosher!
I know your stance on rubber bands. You still have to wear a wedding band.
Because of what happened last time I held your hand!
You are just so shellfish
No offense Charley, but I prefer the tail over the claw.
This isn’t what I meant when I said I wanted you to change.
There was no need to snap at me like that...
I expect you to keep your claws to yourself.
Why didn't you just take the bib?
When you said you were caught 'red-handed', 
I thought you were just using colorful language.
I told you not to go to Chernobyl.
Be careful. I am boiling mad.
Seriously? Shorts in October!
I knew I shouldn't have let you meet my sisters without wearing your rubber bands.
And why should I let you scuttle back to me this time?
Really?  You had one wish and you went with lobster claws?
No, it’s the clause you added to the prenup I’m really upset about.
When you said you felt like lobster claws, I thought you wanted to go out for seafood.
You knew the costume party was hosted by a vegan.
...and please stop reminding me that I knew what you were when I married you.
Stop trying to claw back into my good graces.
You’re still more of a man than my last boyfriend.
No, it's not your flaws that I find irritating.
I have told you a million times. Do not snap at me in public.
Really, then why did she have marks all over her?
Let’s just say balloon animals are not your forte.
You're right-- it does help to remember that it's not your first fashion faux pas.
So sleep with the fishes, not me.
I didn't know that you were THAT allergic to Seafood!
I'm sorry, but I just don't like beards.
I hate it when you don’t wear socks.
Do you have a dime for the parking meter?
You won't even commit to a simple rubber band.
You’re no catch, Robert.
To you it’s a statement on the Kafkaesque nature of the human condition. To me you’re a jackass.
Next time you even think of wearing jean shorts I'm putting the rubber bands back on.
I'm Kosher.
You were expecting Oysters Rockefeller?
You should have mentioned it in you online profile.
You can’t use that as an excuse for everything Andrew.
I just assumed if you could swipe right your hands would be normal.
Don't even try to butter me up.
Well, you didn't get it from me.  I'm Jewish!
I think it IS an affectation.
Yeah, sure. As if everyone didn’t see you pinch her ass.
Serves you right. You could have wished for anything. But no, you had to wish for a stronger grip!
Who’s a good catch now?
You know what they say about a man with big hands!
Yeah, yeah, you should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
And you accuse ME of being crabby!
I didn't KNOW they had hot tub...but you didn't have to snap at them like that!
Holding hands shouldn't be this painful.
Honey!, You are not the only one feeling crabby today!
I’m sorry I snapped.
I promised to love you in sickness and in health. I don't recall anything about lobster hands.
I specifically mentioned in my dating profile that I'm Jewish.
You didn't need to snap at me..
We all get it, Larry, you're a VIP Rouge member at Red Lobster.
You'll wear them until you promise to keep your hands off the hot intern at work!
One more word about my mother and the elastic bands go back on!
All those fish in the sea, and I had to catch a lobster...
I told you, it was a one night swim.
I'm beginning to think this seafood diet of yours isn't such a good idea.
I can’t believe you talked me into taking you to my manicurist.”
The doctor says l have crabs.
I know you are proud of being from Maine, George, but this is going a bit too far!
...and furthermore, I’m allergic to shell fish.
When your profile said you were crabby, I thought you meant more crabby 'brusque' then crabby bisque.
Jon, Professor Xavier is going to know those aren't real
I don't care how ridiculous you look going to a business meeting like this - I'm NOT going to change your pants for you!
I told you to wear pants.
Consider the lobster?! How come it’s never consider the woman who has to hold hands with the lobster?
At least you stopped scratching yourself.
Sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you.
Sometimes a bib is just a bib.
You could have mentioned this in your dating profile
I just can't believe how shellfish you are.
I'd be more excited if  you had a tail.
I’m reaching my boiling point
One wish, Zoltar says. So what does my husband, super genius lobster lover wish for?”
They're nice people, and you can't expect everyone to know the difference between a crab and a lobster claw.
Oh of course, I'M the shellfish one.
If you do that again I'll make you wear the rubber bands.
Well, you most certainly did not get them from me!
What I don't understand is wearing a long-sleeve shirt with shorts.
Say what you want Rick, it’s obvious you’ve reached your boiling point.
You're particularly crabby this evening.
Just remember to start with the fork on the outside first, and no one will notice.
It's not like we mentioned her crows' feet.
I just don’t know why you can’t just keep your claws to yourself.
Fine, if butter makes you nervous, don't eat it. But don't expect me to give it up.
don't snap at me!
Why yes, I did date Edward Scissorhands. Why do you ask?
Didn't you learn anything from Jeff Goldblum?!?
You have absolutely no grasp on reality.
You could be a billionaire right now, but NO! You had to ask for a claw. Then, you wished for a "monster hog," knowing that genies are very literal-minded. Still, I could forgive all that — but how did you, with one wish left, ask for a SECOND CLAW!?
I don't know what that couples counselor was talking about, YOU'RE the crabby one in this relationship-- you get it from your mother's side.
Just keep your hands to yourself!
You could have at least tried to fit in.
You've been kind of a crab lately...
I warned you time and time again, she really is a witch and she’s ultra sensitive about the way her hands look, but would you listen...
If you say you got caught red-handed one more time I will scream.
Yes, I understand, they're your favorite mittens.
The bib wasn’t enough, was it? Ya haaad to haaave the lil’ lobstah claws.
Remind me to boil some water when we get home.
I told you I keep Kosher when we met,
Oh, NOW you develop a butter allergy.
You can just be so shellfish sometimes, Frank..
When my doubles partner called you the "lob-ster", 
I thought she was commending your backcourt return.
When you said you’d claw your way to the top, I thought it was metaphorical!
mobster you said?
'Bastard! You'd do anything to avoid a wedding ring!'
Honestly, I don’t understand your silly refusal to join us in Sally and Mike’s backyard hot tub.
Please stop snapping at me, you're not the only one who can be crabby."
This is why our sex life is dying, Gerald.
You are always side-stepping my questions, Gary.
"Let me guess: Edward Scissorhands incognito?"
Is this your way of saying you won’t hold hands with me in public?
Not what I had in mind for a lobster dinner.
I know you’re really good on the inside.
I don’t care what your therapist says, this isn’t healthy.
They do not help you pick up things better.
I'll do the melted butter, but I am not wearing that little bib.
Next time you see my parents just don’t shake their hands.
I’ve had bad manicures too. Quit complaining!
Okay, but this is the last time I help you go to the bathroom.
Deal with it. You're not in Maine anymore.
I told you not to put your hands in the lobster tank
Just because they add a little color to our lives doesn't mean I have to like them!
No, I don't hold hands on a blind date.
Okay I get it... No need to snap at me!
Rule #1: When I say 'hands off', I mean it!
This is what I get for moving to Maine.
No, I haven’t told my parents about you yet, and it has nothing to do with you not being Jewish.
Would you mind not cracking your hands?
That’s the last time I ask you to scratch my back.
When we got married I didn't read that lobster clause carefully enough.
I don't understand- you said you liked lobster claws...
You woke up a little crabby today.
You need to update your profile picture.
I'm not being shellfish, you're just being crabby.
You're being so shellfish!
No! You cannot hold my hand.
frankly, you're being you're being a bit crabby.
That is the LAST time I take you to look at waterbeds.
When you said you had crabs I thought you were kidding.
I'm tired of being the turf to your surf.
I’m really not interested in your ancestry, but I wouldn’t mind a look at your DNA
You just had to pinch the baby's cheeks, didn't you?
At least you lost the tail.
Let's skip the foreplay today.
Don’t talk about ME being snippy!
Why can’t I meet a normal man with “We’re #1” foam hands?
Could we try something other than seafood tonight?
You have a way of always leading me into a trap.
Everyone is staring at your jean shorts.
It's only just that I think the shorts are inappropriate.
I can't believe that you wore shorts to dinner.  You couldn't dress up a little to meet my parents??!?!
You could have just said that you don't want to wear your wedding ring.
What I don't understand is why you decided to boil them.
I wish I’d married a Taurus.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I wanted to go out for lobster.
How could you have known that the drug trials would have resulted in adding color to the New Yorker cartoon at great expense?!
You just had to go to Area 51, didn't you?
Will you stop ending everything you say with '...in a pinch.'
I'm not the one who's crabby
My lawyer said to pull up the prenuptual claws
Good luck trying to claw your way out of this one.
It always boils down to 'I feel trapped' with you
Sometimes you're such a crab!
I said we’re through. Can’t you grasp anything?
John, you must give up this idea of becoming a pianist.
If you call me crabby again, you'll be in hot water, mister.
I said keep your filthy
 claws off of me
Not all they’re cracked up to be, are they?
One more time and—I swear—I'm gonna put your rubber bands back on.
Why is that so hard to grasp?
And all this time I thought you were a Gemini!
Well, in the bright side , we got you out of hot water just in time
Will you take those fucking things off?
Your dating profile definitely should have mentioned this.
Oh sure, you think you’ve grown a pair, but you’re spineless –just an exoskeleton of your former self!
I admit I didn't think about the impact on our sex life.
Just because you have them doesn't mean you have to keep using them that way.
It's not cold enough for mittens, you're making us look weird.
Better this than your right to bear arms.
There must be another way to get to the top.
It's my fault. When you said you were into "roll playing," I had something else in mind.
I hate it when you snap at me!
I hope you saved the receipt...
I think you should keep your claws to yourself.
Why did you have to snap at me in public?
Another successful dinner with the in-claws...
I can’t believe you’re wearing jorts on Date Night.
I just dont understand your fear of jacuzzis.
Please tell me this is just until Halloween.
How can we maintain a healthy relationship when you are always so shellfish?
Why do people keep calling me Mrs. Claus?
If you have to use the restroom, you're on your own!
...and, my parents likely won’t believe you’re Jewish.
Do you really think role playing will reignite our sex life?
No Steve! That, I don't mind. It's the garlic butter!
You could've at least tried the bisque.
I don't mean to be critical, but you need a shave, a new wardrobe,
a haircut, and hand moisturizer.
Yes, I’m angry right now, but you are constantly crabby!!
You couldn't just buy a corvette like all the other men going through a mid-life crisis...
I am very sorry I cannot see you again, I have a shellfish Allergy.
...and I suppose those are the Thermidore shorts that came with them?
Why do you always have to be such a crab about everything?
Why does it always have to be a seafood restaurant?
I’m the one who should feel trapped.
Stop whining about it, your brother got the tail!
You promised to have that taken care of after we got married.
At least you don't walk sideways.
Nope, the other two wishes are mine.
Sorry, Brad, but I don't think those will really help you claw your way to the top.
Honestly, I've always preferred the tails.
No, David...I don't think shorts were too casual.
Oh sure, but you were fine with Johnny Depp and the scissorhands thing.
And it so happens that your name is Claude
I thought you said you were mainstream. Not Maine stream!
You just HAD to snap at that wizard, didn't you.
Did you really call me "crabby"?
Don't you get snappy with me
You really should have put this in your Tinder bio.
Now look who's in a crabby mood.
Must you jump in the tank with them every single time we're out for dinner?
The woman on the boat thought you were quite the catch.
You know you were flirting. I caught you red-handed.
I assumed you meant transgender, not trans-species.
Crustacean Liberation Front, my ass. That's the last time I'm going grocery shopping with you.
Sometimes you’re just so shellfish.
If I have to be The Turf again this year you are in hot water.
Damn.hurry back to the ocean. You're already transforming.
It amuses me that your mother thought that I would be trying to get my claws into you."
I still don't understand your emails.
Why can't you claw your way to the top the same way everyone else does?
There’s always an excuse to not hold hands
I really don't like when you refer to me as 'The ol' rubber band'
Touch me again and you sleep in the butter dish tonight!
Don't forget, we have to be in Kennebunkport by April.
The B-52s are a band not a lifestyle.
I don’t even know why I agreed to remove your rubber bands for tonight?
Well, you certainly didn't get the crabs from me.
Honey, I'm glad your no longer smoking but when can you take the claws off?
No, I don't think our nickname should be "Surf 'n Turf"!
Once again I caught you red-handed!
arent you getting tired of finger foods???
Why the hell is it I keep having to fish you out of hot water?
Now I don't want you to hurt him. I just want you to scare him.
Did you have to wear shorts?
You pick up stuff.  It's not a super power.
Exactly how long will this crustacean phase last?
Your handshake was fine, but it would it have killed you to shave?
Mother was right.  You are cray cray, Bruce.
. . . it's just that I never would have guessed you were Jewish. 
Nothing to get steamed about.
Why do you have to get so crabby when we go visit my mother?
My mother always said you were not the catch I claimed you were.
And would you stop singing "Sandy Claws is coming to town"?
You are, hands down, the most insensitive lover ever.
This is the last time I go out with a pescatarian
No, I didn't take you literally when  you said you'll claw your way to the top.
This is never going to work. I'm a Sagittarius who likes change, and I think we both know what you are.
I smell a trap.
Freakin' surrealists! Can't you just PAINT lobsters - do you have to paint AS a lobster!
I told you to get the whole costume. Now they'll all know we're lobsters.
Okay, I'll show you where the nail salon is, but I'm not going in with you!
You're in really hot water after this.
Let's get our Halloween costumes straight. You're the vegan-animal-rights-environmentalist. And I'm the bitch.
It was a simple request. Leave the rubber bands on at the hot air balloon show.
When my parents are visiting, please don’t scuttle.
I don't care what you think, "Lobsessive" Compulsive Disorder isn't a real thing.
Seriously, Frank. You know I hate it when you grow a beard!
You've been so shellfish lately, Tom.
Don’t bother lying.  When you left tonight you were tailed.
Doesn't matter what the powers are, "lobsterman" is an occupation, not a superhero.
I know, I know. It's the only contraception Planned Parenthood offers.
Well, maybe I'm feeling a little trapped, too...
Mary Jane’s boyfriend Peter got bit by a radioactive spider does all kinds of cool stuff.  And all you can say is that you’re tasty with butter?!
Larry couldn't understand Olivia's clawstrophobia.
And to think that I gave up Edward Scissorhands for you!
As I just said, everything was wonderful except the foreplay
You” and your
“Save the lobsters”
Campaign !!!
And if all the other hipsters jumped off the roof, would you do that too?
You knew it was a witch's restaurant before you ordered the lobster claws.
The next time we go to a "meet and greet"  I'm putting the rubber bands back on.
Whoever said ‘love conquers all’ was a fool.
How many times do I have to tell you? I prefer the tail.
You're not the only one who feels trapped in this relationship.
I'm a crab?  You're a crab!
If I hear you talking about clawing your way to the top, one more time, I'm going to scream.
Okay! I promise to never again tell you to 'Get a grip!'
You'll regret it if they're serving finger food.
I guess I'll pass on the lobster roll.
No Ethan, you're a shellfish jerk.
Would have it been so terrible to ask for a doggie bag??
Why are you being such a crab?
I suppose you want me to come and go talking of Michelangelo.
Well someone's a bit crabby today.
I didn’t say you were grouchy, I said you were crabby
Yeah, so you really think the jury's going to buy that?
Why do you have to be so shellfish?
You could have mentioned those in your Tinder profile.
It's not "float like a butterfly, pinch like a bee"
Well, if she is just an old friend, why did she spend the whole meal buttering you up?
And you were complaining about my red shoes.
I know my profile said I love lobster, but..
That's the last time I help you go to the bathroom.
Market price is good, if you ever pinch me again I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you.
And did you notice the smirk on that waiter’s face when we asked for more butter?
Don't you feel crabby sometimes?
Looks like you got yourself into some hot water
I don't care if you like the tail - I'm not wearing one.
What's wrong with the tank you have?
You caught me red handed.  Again.
I coulda sworn your profile said part motocyclist, part MOB-ster...
I’m getting tired of your constant snapping at me.
This is the last time we see Dr. Moreau for your arthritis.
You know, the HR department making you wear the “Pinchers of Shame” is actually something to be ashamed of.
Right! You couldn't help pinching the waitress!
And for god’s sake, don’t monopolize the Beluga hors d’oeuvres.
How am I the snappy one?
Get over it. Edward Scissorhands tanked his first audition.
I told you not to take the rubberbands off until the second date.
I specifically said "Lobster Roll"....not stroll....
But you used to love it when I rubbed you with butter
I have never understood a single sentence in The New Yorker
So that's all you could think of when the genie gave you a free wish.
Nothing against lobstermen, I just think your pictures were misleading.
All of the animal kingdom and you choose this?
I think we need to talk about our sex life.
I seriously doubt this will land Maine an NFL team.
I mean, you could have at least wished for jazz hands.
I don’t care if they are your favorite team.
Well, your interspecies dating fling has certainly presented a challenge to our relationship.
At least the remote control is all mine now!
You could've just said you don't like holding hands in public.
You know what I hate most about this whole lobster claw hands phase you are going through? Helping you pee!
No, I didn’t choose you from the tank.
That is the last time we go to Red Lobster for sex advice!
So... I thought that when you said you were into lobsters, you meant eating them!
That’s not what I was talking about when I said lobster is an aphrodisiac.
What did you think the replacement clause meant ?
If you're thinking 'this might be the night,' then you can forget it.
New York on a Saturday, you'd think it'd be easy to find some butter.
Next time maybe we take the genie more seriously?
You don’t have to tell me that Maine is in your blood.
Can't you play anything besides "Chopsticks"?
I liked it better when you were all hands.
I thought you and Dad would get along, considering how much he values a firm handshake.
Remember when we used to hold hands?
Yet another reason why full body shots in dating profiles should be mandatory.
You agree? Pinch me, I must be dreaming.
I should never have let you start a species reassignment surgery
Clawing your way back won't work, Harry.
You just can't keep your claws off
Let's go eat lobster, you said. It'll be fun, you said.
I knew we stayed too long in Maine
Do that once more and I'm getting out the rubber bands.
Enough with the "oh snap!"
You're just like your father, you never let things go.
I told you to wear your long pants
Some guys are all hands--but not you.
How can you win first prize when you've lost the rest of the costume?
Honestly Jeff, sometimes you can be just a pinch annoying.
It’s not an accident that nobody makes a lobster claw dildo
You cray cray.
If I could wipe my own butt I wouldn't be asking you to!
I told you to wear rubber bands when we go out in public.
No, I will not wear eau de clarified butter and thats final!
I told you not to participate in that stupid gene splicing experiment.
What dd you expect, the hands of Horowitz?
Well I can tell you right now Nephro, we are never visiting another petting zoo!
It's humiliating enough! Did they have to print us in two colors?
I just don't want to get hurt again.
This is not going to get you out of doing the dishes.
How many times have I told you "pinch me, I'm must be dreaming" is a figure of speech, not meant literally?
I told you I had a thing for mobsters.
Well, clawing your way to the top hasn't worked, has it!
Yes, you did tell me your name was Clawed, but I didn't think it was spelled that way.
If you had cloven feet, or even scales, fine, but my parents don’t like me dating shellfish men.
I said Prenuptial "clause"!
Why couldn't you pick a normal pair of gloves?
I'm sorry, Larry, but you simply can't blame everything on that.
From now on, keep your claws off me.
If runway designers jumped off a cliff would you do that too?
Josephine told me last night you couldn't keep your claws off her.
Beware.  I'm boiling mad!
When you said you had crabs I didn't know it was this serious
And don't you dare tell me you got them from trying on pants!"
You couldn’t get a doggie bag like everyone else?
I just feel like we're not the same type.
Oh you don't think my parents are going to ask if your Jewish?
I'm translobster.
I preferred the scissors...
And you call me a crab?
Did you have to start crying when you saw your cousin on the plate?
That's it...were getting rubber bands!
Say one more thing and I'll boil you head first
I told you don't get grabby...now you've ruined a nice evening.
I just don't think it's a big enough reason not to have children.
It’s always the same excuse with you.
I guess they're better than alligator arms when the check comes.
I'd've thought that would be on your profile.
I can’t bring you home for dinner because my parents keep kosher.
I said you are being selfish, not shellfish!
and in the era of "me too!"
Even if I do dress as a cup of melted butter, I don't think we're gonna win.
I suppose you also have crabs?
I just want you to stop saying "vice-like grip".
And you say I'm crabby.
When your profile said that you identify as a lobster, I thought you were joking.
YOU CAN FORGET THE FOREPLAY!
When you asked me if I was allergic to shellfish, I thought you were being ironic.
How do you even wipe your a- nevermind. I don't want to know. God why can’t I just meet a normal guy? Fuck you, Tinder.
Now what's the matter?
You just had to say "Let's get tanked!"
Pinch my ass one more time and you'll be relocated to Riker's Island!
what possibly could have happened that you stopped taking my calls?
It's not going to happen. Stop singing I want to hold you hand.
I saw you clawing that woman!
I've got your nose?... Larry ... Seriously, you played I've got your nose?
It's that darn sex offender registration.
I thought you were saying you wanted to be "selfish" for once.
Touch my butt again and I'll turn you into a toad.
You seem to always forget your wallet.
So what, we'll just never thumb wrestle?
Ok, you’ve clawed your way to the top; now what?
I told you 'prenuptial claws'  was a stupid bit.
I told you the maitre d' wouldn't seat a man wearing shorts.
I told you, don’t snap at me!
Online you said you were Kosher
You might have mentioned that "The Metamorphosis" is your favorite book in your profile.
Is THIS the anti-mugging device that you ordered off the internet?
I don’t think we’re at the stage where you meet my parents. Also, my father is allergic to shellfish.
I caught him red-handed.
How did you even swipe right with those things?
If the theater is going to insist on rubber bands, they should at least provide them.
And second, Mom, dental school was your dream, not mine.
Edward Lobster-Hands and his agent after failing their audition.
All I said was why don't we try that seafood restaurant on 48th street.
Now I know what it feels like  to be caught red-handed.
I can't believe you won't introduce me your parents!
Well, Jeff, I still contend your protest over the tariffs is a tad too subtle.
I think it's a bit of a stretch to call those "loving hands"
in your dating profile
I’m just so tired of everyone calling you ‘Santa’...
I wish they were just clammy again.
That’s it. We’re putting the rubber bands back on.
Of course people were staring all night - look at the way you're dressed!
I can’t put my finger on it, but something about this relationship isn’t kosher.
No pussy grabbing for you
Foreplay is out, dream date.
You were all handsy earlier, and now this? Your mood swings are out of control!
I know you’re achey, but I wouldn’t take a hot bath if I were you.
I thought your profile said a couple of small flaws, 
not huge tall claws!!
No way am I letting you bring those into the bedroom.
Stop saying that I'm trying to butter you up.
Try to be less crabby when we visit my parents.
I am not "A prisoner of binary thinking"!
My mother warned me about dating someone from Maine.
I hate that the kids call you CrawDad
You bet I'm boiling mad.
No, I will NOT call you. Crawdaddy.
Why don’t you just say you want to move to Maine
I don't care if you saw lint on my blouse and skirt!
I didn't like the way you looked at that crab.
Stay away from the cat.
No, actually, I couldn't see them on your Tinder profile.
I'm tired of having you pick up fish for dinner
He definitely won’t be able to find my clit now.
My father loathes a weak handshake.
I'm just  sick of your shellfishness
No, when they say, “You literally have to claw your way to the top here,” they do not actually mean “literally.”
I wish you had transplanted another part of your anatomy.
So shellfish... you KNOW I'm allergic to hyperbole.
When you told me that they caught you red-handed, I didn't think you meant it literally!
You dropped a ming vase? You wonder why they call you butterfingers!
You can't let go of anything, can you?
No one appreciates you pointing out that's your friend in the tank.
I know your profile said you've been slowly coming out of your shell, but honestly I just feel deceived.
We have to get you more out of your shell.
So much for trying to claw your way to the top.
You can beg all you want, no butter sauce in bed
This is FAR worse than when you fell in love with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and wore that stupid fedora for three months.
The way you touch me just isn't kosher
You could at least aspire to be some sort of superhero.
I don't know why you insist on shopping at that second-hand store.
You promised me that you were going to get a manicure beforeour anniversary dinner!
No, you can't pinch my butt.
I didn't understand the special 'claws' in our prenuptial agreement.  Now I'm going to leave you red-handed !
Looks like you're cooked.
You just had to touch the china, didn't you?!
Your solidarity with the ocean population goes too far.
You're the shellfish one in this relationship!
I'm crabby?
Sometimes I wish you hadn't come out of your shell.
I still don't see why you aren't letting me get a unicorn horn, Bill.
I suppose you think my allergy to shellfish is the only problem?
Just once could you not say "I'll just have a pinch, please."
That's not what I meant when I said, 'Wear something snappy!'.
No,no! A comma puts a pause at the end of your clause.
I should be the one who is crabby.
When you molt they will come off
Clawing your way to the top is fine, but you might want to consider a business suit.
It isn’t as good as spiderman but it is better than roachboy.
Your love for lobster is getting out of hand.
Oh right, you always win the I felt awkward thing.
How can you possibly think they don’t define you?!
Stop it, before I get crabby!
You and your allergies have once again ruined our evening!
I caught you red-handed  flirting with my best friend, Larry.
I begged you not to play that piano.
Red Lobster doesn't and will never need a mascot, Bill. Quit trying.
You transition, you get crabby."
Try that again and I'm getting out the rubber bands.
I'm boiling right now! No offense.
Damn it Glen!  I told you to lay off the breast stuff!
What did you expect they were gonna tell you when you asked for a manicure?!
Clawed? Clawed? Being pawed is bad enough.
I can't order lobster, but you can order ladyfingers?
Of course I’m not going to forgive you! I’ve just caught you
red- handed.
If they had boiled the rest of you we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
If you grab my butt one more time . . .
Those were NOT apparent from your profile pictures!
Whenever we visit my family in Maine its like you grow a shell that you want hide in
And what a wasted wish that was, Mr. Prufrock!
You can't wear those forever, David. You're going to have to hold my sister's newborn eventually.
It's fine. I can get my ring resized.
You didn’t need to take me so seriously when I suggested you should try clawing your way to the top.
I miss the days when your hands were just cold and clammy.
You know I never have liked that shirt.
Oh so the rubber bands come off and suddenly you’re Mr. Big Shot?
I look at you, and all I see is red!!
Don’t be embarrassed Phil.  I’m sure there were some other people who also thought Lobsterfest was like Comic-Con for seafood lovers.
God, I hate your circus friends.
Why are you always so crabby?"
"Because you have no idea who I am!
I just don't think 'Lobsterman' has much of a superhero ring to it!
You can’t claw your way out this time.
Yes, I know how it feels to be trapped
Why am I disappointed?  Of course I assumed your profile was referring to dinner.
You can bet you're gonna be in hot water!
That's not what you father meant when he said you have to claw your way to success.
You give me claws for alarm.
We should've known, with a name like 'Prosthetics R Us'.
It’s always the same story - we go out, you drink too much and then you start clawing at me.
I don't know what you were thinking - you know the tail is my favorite part."
Oh yeah?  And you’re no Prufrock.
All your friends wear rubber bands. Why do you have to be different?
If you have to wear them, fine! But I will not call you Santa.
Just tell me how you got the rubber bands off!
You embarrassed me in that balloon modelling class.
Just get a grip!
Fine, I get it — You feel like a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas. But at least you could’ve shaved.
I’m sick of you ignoring my texts.
This won't work Bill, you're too shellfish.
When you called me to tell me you had crabs I didn’t think that THIS is what you meant.
Well....o.k. But no foreplay
You must admit you have been more than a little crabby lately
I double-checked your online dating profile again.  You definitely did not include a hyphen in your occupation, ‘Lobster-Man’.
I can get crabby sometimes. You made your point.
Seriously? That makes up for giving me crabs?
Yet again, Malcolm mysteriously finds himself facing accusations of getting "grabby" in public.
I'm allowed to be crabby sometimes too!
You could have at least tried on the tail.
Just because you're buying me dinner doesn't mean you can put your claws all over me later on.
I saw you pinch her ass
There's a reason we don't hold hands in public
And if I get wet I turn into a little mermaid.
I know they cost $1200, but you look ridiculous.
"You're been acting very shellfish lately."
Why couldn't you just ask for a doggy bag?
Well, I do feel left out when you go to your crustacean group meetings.
I knew you weren't having safe sex!
Rabbi doesn't approve of us.
The days I only got a peck on the cheek are looking good now.
John if I hear you say 'claw-ful' one more time we are done...
This isn't gonna work if you keep sidestepping all my advances.
Not what I meant by "Arbitration Clause"
Don't try clawing your way out of this one
I normally like a lot of foreplay, but . . .
Why do you always have to be so shellfish?
You always have to take the rubber bands off, don't you?
God, what a mistake. You seemed like such a catch.
I want a divorce, Clawed.
That “little pinch” was far more than just a tease  sir!
Claude, how many times do I have to tell you. Stop pinching me. It hurts.
You clearly don’t understand a pre-nuptial clause, or a homonym.
You're taking your T. S. Eliot infatuation too far.
Pinching was supposed to just be our special thing.
I just wish you’d gotten bitten by a Merman instead.
That’s not even your Maine problem!
You know how I love to be buttered up.
Did you really have to go to such lengths not to hold my bag?
Maybe you could be less shellfish.
Well, you certainly were crabby this evening.
You were nicer with a tail.
Butter might free me but it seems like bad karma.
So you won't be a piano player... It's OK..
Never.
Date night and you are wearing board shorts and a sweatshirt. We are not going to Applebees! I hate my life.
At least they stopped commenting on my "tail."
The next time someone says she could use a hand, try to remember the last three lawsuits
Please don’t try anything on our first date.
your wearing shorts in October !
And your calling me crabby!!
OK but the claws weren't in any of your Tinder photos.
You are just so damned shellfish.
You're taking your T.S.Eliot thesis waaay too seriously.
I see you were caught red-handed.  What's your excuse this time?
I'm sorry but that's not an excuse for pinching her.
Keep your claws to yourself! You're not the President!
You do everything halfway, Jeffrey.
I was a mermaid."
It's not you, I just don't like holding hands.
No, Peter, you were supposed to get bitten by a spider, not a spider crab!"
I don’t care if they were on sale.
Maybe massage therapy just isn't your thing..
That's no excuse for not reaching for the check
Look Ma no hands.
Don't even THINK about holding my hand."
If the Mayor wants you to do ribbon cuttings he should pay you.
What did you think of the crab cakes?
Your piano gig at the seafood restaurant did not go well!
They better be returnable.
Rubber Bands are Wedding Bands in Maine
You're REALLY going to be in hot water when we get home.
I suppose you think I'm going to change the kitty litter from  now on!
‘That’s the last time I go on Plenty of Fish.’
I’m just tired of you always snapping at me.
I caught you red handed buttering her up at the seafood bar.
I just wish you’d leave skeletons in the closet instead of on the bathroom floor.
You should have told me your crabs had gotten worse.
Did you notice Chloe's slight about you growing up in Maine?
I really mean when I say “keep your claws off me!”.
So that's how you were able to claw your way to the top?
What next, tails?
I've never teased you about YOUR mother.
When you wrote on your dating profile that your friends call you “Claude,” I didn’t know they meant that literally.
Can’t say I ever thought I would be banned from a Red Lobster.
You can stop trying to butter me up, I’m real steamed
Well, you're the one whose crabby!
I told you not to eat the lobster bisque with your fingers.
and you said I'M a crab?
Oh, I'm the one being snippy?
This is so humiliating; all my friends say that you must be lousy in bed.
I did not say you're a crab. I just said you're acting like one.
Okay, okay, you've made your point.  You're not a shellfish guy.
You’re right, I should have put this in my profile.
I told you to shave and I hate those shorts!
I said our prenuptial agreement contained a 'clause,' not..
You're being shellfish again.
You wouldn’t even try on the mittens my mother knit you.
When your transition is complete, you'll be doing your own zipping.
NO!!  I don't care,
I don't want us to help each other in the restroom
I just don’t see Broadway being that interested in doing a musical about your life, that’s all.”
I should have been suspicious when your Match.com nickname was "Giant Lobster Claws"
If you call me the crabby one ONE MORE TIME, so help me God, I’ll—
This week on "Botched". . .
You are so bathetic.
You know the Halloween party is on cape cod...Lobster costumes are out sharks are in ....
And they named you Claude why?
Do NOT make me take out the rubber bands again!!
There’s nothing in your Tinder profile about been a CRISPR afionado
Just wait 'til I get a piranha mouth.
You should have told me that your mother is a lobster.
You could have told me you didn’t want to go to Red Lobster and spared me your tirade.
You hand models are something else.
Your online profile said "suffers from clammy hands" but this is a little too much for me.
I am NOT crabby. 
You Are!!!
If you didn't want to see the palm reader you should have just said so!
So, you're a witch who doesn't like men who get "handsy" on first dates.  Noted!
You know, you can just say that you don't like going to the sign language class with me.
I said I have a thing for MOBsters
Can we stop at Walgreen’s? I need some rubber bands.
I thought I had finally cracked you, Lou, but wow, you're a lot of work.
For dinner, I wanted lobster for dinner.
"Sorry...I just don't see us mating for life.
And you still can't grab a cab!
You are not allowed in a thrift store alone anymore.
I thought you were kidding when you said our pre-nup had a lobster clause.
I thought your NAME was Claude.
If I have told you once, I have told you a thousand times to keep your claws off me, or there will be consequences.
I hate it when you get so crabby.
Sorry, but scuttling across the floors of silent seas is not my idea of a hot first date.
This wouldn’t happen if you kept your hands to yourself.
You better keep your claws to yourself, Mister
Don't shake anybody's hand- our insurance won't cover it.
Quit trying to butter me up.
Not only too expensive but they're starting to smell bad.
Whatever you read on the Internet, I can assure you that walking around with huge lobster claws on your hands will not raise your IQ.
Embarrass me again and you are in hot water!
OK, but no more foreplay
Will you put those things away!
My last boyfriend has Russian hands and the previous Roman fingers but you
win out as a bottom feeder.
I told you to use hand lotion.
Butter fingers is not a compliment.
And keep your claws off me!
You don't think that's an over-reaction to #MeToo?
Any new strategies for "clawing your way to the top"?
Mother didn't think it was funny either!
That was the first and last time we go to second base.
There is no need to snap at me!
If you touch my hair again, you’ll be in hot water.
Cold hands, warm heart.
You can take the man out of Maine but...
I guess we won’t be holding hands any time soon,
No Bermudas in months with an R, what on earth...?
You asked me to draw you a hot bath. So what if it was over an open flame."
I've been catfished, but never crawfished.
You deserve crabs! That's what you get for cheating!
No! Not if you’re going to keep snapping at me like that.”
I mean, we GOT our flu shots. Why won't she let us hold the new baby?
Just another excuse to avoid chores
I can't believe you didn't speak to me before you had it done.
A first-class restaurant would have put your takeaway leftovers in a bag.
If I have to say it again, our divorce will be at ‘Market Price’.
I'm sorry. Jewish parents like mine just have old-fashioned ideas about potential husband material.
You can't claw your way out of this, Jeff!
Remember me telling you, 'you are what you eat'?
You should have told me you were related before I ordered.
If you're going to claw your way up, you might want to re-think the shorts.
That's not what I meant when I said I hope our neighbor gets pinched for stealing our newspapers.
We’re together and you should wear your bands
You’re gonna be in hot water when we get home.
Not from Maine? Boston perhaps?
I’m just afraid you’re going to get attached.
All I'm saying is that you've been crabby lately.
We can't go on like this, Carl.  I keep kosher.
I thought once I cut the rubber bands off, we could at least try holding hands.
My favorite movie? Edward Scissorhands!
Stop lying. I caught you red-handed.
Oh, get a grip, Frank.
Well, you do have a nice thorax.
Never, repeat, never pat me on the bottom again!
Did you have to be that snappy to the waiter?
So you're Claude, eh? I should have known..
There's no need to get snippy!
I'll "do in a pinch"?  That really hurts!
I told you I preferred clammy hands.
Good luck hailing a cab.
I had way more fun dating that fly with the human head and arms.
I asked you to call a cab...
I know you're uncomfortable at seafood restaurants, but sometimes I just have to have some.
Your father runs a lobster boat, what does your mother do?
It's nothing that a little butter couldn't fix.
And another thing: why do I always have to carry your wallet. I'm not your mother.
You have the right to bear arms.  You do not have the right to lobster arms.
I said I’m sorry. Just please stop saying you’re boiling mad!
I did say that I love lobster, but this changes nothing for us.
I’m frustrated, too. They said they had an iPhone for everybody.
And another thing. No more sex.
I know you think you can claw your way to the top, but this is ridiculous.
No need to get all snappy
We're in quite a pinch, aren't we?
I had something else in mind when I read in your dating profile that you clawed your way to the top.
I hate the fact that you now always have to wear loafers.
How do you expect to claw your way to the top wearing shorts in October?
Of course I'm upset! You never help with the dishes!
And I thought your Hulk hands were bad!
You sure you don’t need a hand?
I'm sorry. I just don't trust you without the rubber bands.
You don't have to be snappy with me.
People make assumptions when they see a man with big crab hands.
It's not my fault the text autocorrected Lakers to Lobsters!
A toilet seat?  I don't believe you!
Ok, like you never do any frivolous shopping
My colleague will recover but the next time I introduce you to someone, first put on your rubber bands.
You don’t have to be embarrassed. Last week I dated a real mollusk!
You KNOW how crabby it makes me when you pinch women on the subway!
I am sure you said: Dress For Dinner, not Dress AS Dinner.
I just wish we could eat somewhere that serves more than starfish, sea urchins, and marine worms
How many times do I have to say it, the drawn butter was for my toast.
Stop saying "Don't bite the hand that feeds you."
Only you would interpret this as clawing your way to the top
Great, we'll never have lunch with Poseidon again.
I know why I'm crabby.  What's your excuse?
This is the last year you're entering The Dumbest Mittens Contest.
You'll do anything to get out of paying the check!
Get a grip pal, your casual butt pinching days are over with those new gloves I got you.
No, you can lie about your age and weight online, not about having claws for hands.
Pinch me one more time and I swear I'll turn those red claws blue.
It wasn't your claws that kept us from getting a table, but that you thought jean shorts were proper dress for a 5-star restaurant.
I’m sure she WANTED to shake hands, but I already told you Mila’s Kosher!
I had the strangest dream last night. Your feet were duck feet.
4th of July,Portland,Maine
So, this is what you meant when you said you had hot hands.
Draw me like one of your French girls? You can't even draw butter.
How many times do I have to say it? I am a capable independent woman who can crack open her own mussels at dinner.
This is why I can't date East Coast men.
When you phoned me and said you’d acquired superhero powers, at first I was excited.
No, I'm NOT getting the sexy lobster bib.
And then you overreacted when I simply recommended a hot bath.
Clause, Henry. Prenuptial clause.
I draw the line with the melted butter!
Edward Scissorshand You're Not
That's the last time we watch a Johnny Depp movie before dinner.
I told you when you meet my family, not to shake hands!
Oh, so I'm the crabby one?
Please stop saying you'll 'Be there in a pinch."
The only thing all men seem to have in common is the audacity.
They stay until you learn to keep your hands to yourself.
Maybe you should go back to Maine.
You don't have to be so snappy.
I thought you said you were going for a manicure.
You don't always have to claw your way to the top.
It's already bad enough that you wore shorts...
I know he was my ex, but did you have to shake his hand like that?
Men o Claws
You didn't know it was a kosher restaurant?
It's bad enough you slept with her but did you have to catch the crabs?
Don’t you think those lab experiments has gone a little too far..?
I don’t care what you’ve read on the internet.  Antibiotics will work.
I told you to delete the lobster clause.
One more pinch and I’m getting out the rubber bands.
and you think I'M crabby.
I THOUGHT WE AGREED TO LEAVE THE EPISODE IN BAR HARBOR BEHIND US!
You would have had him if it wasn't for that thing he did with his tail.
You always crack under pressure!
Choosing to wear crab claws shouldn't grant you a disability parking permit.
YOU are the one who's crabby.
Honestly John, just because you won the Silent Auction last week, does not mean you should wear your new gloves everywhere.
I know you're mad. I'm sorry I was snappy.
I thought you said you "loved" lobster, not that you're "part" lobster.
I suppose this means that we will not be able to visit any friends who have a fish tank.
You should have no problem clawing your way to the top.
My mom caught me jerking off!
I hope that teaches you to keep your claws off other women.
It seems like you just can't take a crack anymore.
I liked you better when you weren't so crabby.
I told you Alexa was listening.
Well no, it's not exactly a super power.
I’m not against public displays of affection, Marion - I’d just feel awful if something went wrong.
How was I supposed to know she had a shellfish allergy?
You were right again. They caught me red-handed.
Why didn't you tell me you're allergic to shellfish?
No!  You can't add the tail.
I told you not to eat the Chernobyl lobster just because it was cheap.
I didn't break you out of SeaWorld just to hear you complain about the integrity of my Bouillabaisse.
You’re always so crabby.
I suspect you’re going to want me to give you a butter bath when we get home!
Once again, caught red-handed.
What do you mean, you want to see other mollusks?
We should probably watch Edward Scissorhands
I told you Stanley, sometimes it can be worse than just hairy palms . . .
I can’t love a man whose touch is so shellfish!
I don't want to sound insensitive, but you think you might have included this in your Tinder profile?!"
I don't care if they were serving lobster, I wanted to eat there.
I don't know, Jim...why do you THINK I'm feeling crabby?
You used to hate parties before you came out of your shell.
If you realized the waiter was a genie I suppose you wouldn't have ordered the lobster claws.
I misunderstood your profile when you said you’ve had to claw yourself to the top.
Who are they calling bottom feeders?
I am NOT in a crabby mood!
Fine. You made your point. But did you need to wear them during the salad course too?
Why doesn't anyone take my shellfish allergy seriously?
I told you to use sunscreen.
Look, your profile said arthropod.  I thought that meant you have arthritis.
No, it doesn't sort of give you permission to say to a complete stranger, "Hey, your tail looks delicious".
Hell, it wasn't a problem with the cat.
Stop being so snippy
I told you male enhancement using CRISPR was a bad idea!
I said I love Santa Claus not lobster claws
God, I can't believe you snapped at the waiter again. If you can't control your attitude, we're not doing brunch anymore
You're being awfully crabby today.
I just knew that sex therapist was going to lead us astray!
First it was global warning protests, now it's transmutation of DNA from animals into humans.  What's next, membership in EarthMom.org?  Just can keep your claws to yourself tonight buster.
....but did you have to sit in the tank All diner..?
This is probably a good time to put things on ice.
Yeah, you know what else goes well with lobster? A nice hot bath, followed by a glass of chardonnay!
We’ve been through this! You can pick your nose! You can pick your girlfriend! But you CANNOT PICK YOUR GIRLFRIEND’’S NOSE!!
When you said you were a Lobster fisherman, I wasn’t expecting this.
Yeah, but Ross wasn't ACTUALLY a lobster.
I still don't see why you had to have it done on both hands.
I told you, I don't like it when you get handsy.
Next time just wear the stupid apron!
Well, if couples therapy doesn't work, how about a manicure.
When you said role playing I thought you meant in the bed not at lunch...
If you're going to be crabby, I'm going home.
I distinctly remember telling you my mother was allergic to shell fish.
The claws are the sweetest part.
So now there’s a ‘lobster fight club’?!
Just can’t keep your hands to yourself, can you?
Listen Alan, if you feel like a wus, I don’t care anymore...buy some hand lotion.
I didn’t appreciate the gossip at the party that I have crabs.
This wasn't the reaction I was expecting when I told you to keep your hands off other women.
You can't just claw your way out of everything, Jeff!
No, it has nothing to do with the Me Too movement...your pinching at work just has to stop.
You're always getting caught red-handed.
I suppose it IS better than going blind.
I sure hope that claw back provision in or contract is revocable.
Why so angry? I thought I was your lobster.
The last time you wore those out it got us both in hot water.
Do you really think this will help you claw your way to the top?
I thought you meant you were in a bad mood.
Pinch, pinch, pinch-- all you do is pinch.
You accuse me of being crabby?
I refuse to wear the tail, at least not in public.
Oh, I'M a little crabby?
Okay I get it. No holding hands in public.
You can be so shellfish sometimes.
Yeah, pretty sure the patent's in the bag, David. I'd be more concerned about not having a single sale in over two years on pincerpowerbadass.com.
Oh please. I'm not the one who's crabby.
Would it have killed you to get a doggie bag?
Did you just crab my ass?
This makes no sense at all , Larry.
Unlike my brother Edward, I can pass airline security check
You didn't have to steal them.  They were part of the meal.
If you ever call me Melania again, we'll see who has the sharper claws.
Quit asking me what I'd do in a pinch!
I don't do shellfish.
I’m not saying you have to use your new powers for good, but if a radioactive lobster bit me, I might do thing differently.
If you don't want to do the dishes, just say so.
Ok, I get it-you don't like doing the dishes
You could just say you don't like to shake hands.
Stop saying you don't have a phone, that's ridiculous.
Maybe you're OK with the side effect from your virility prescription, but you can be sure there won't be any more foreplay.
What does she have that I don't, besides the claws?
Colin Farrell you are not.
I do love you. It's just that you're always clawing at me.
Why didn't you just text me?
You don't ever want to pinch my hand anymore.
Had I known this is what you meant by "trans," I never would have messaged you on Tinder.
It's time you got your OWN nail polish!
Foreplay? I don't think so...
I use speech to text.
Didn't I tell you to keep your claws to yourself.
I can't see how you're comfortable going out to dinner in shorts.
Well at least they got the color right!
Unique doesn't cut it when you can't tie your own shoes.
Maybe after you moult...
I wouldn't be crabby if you weren't wearing your claws.
I thought you would be a peel-and-eat-shrimp sort of guy.
Don’t worry, when she turned you into a newt you got better...
Ragged claws, scuttling the floors of silent seas,” my ass
And you didn't even wear a bib.
Told you we should have used “protection.”
I should have been a subordinate clause, scuttling across a silent street.
No, your profile said you had “an active imagination”, not “hands of a crustacean.”
Climate control, schlimate control, moving to Maine is not an option.
Did I ever tell you about that time I used to work at a walnut factory?
I don't mind the shorts, but couldn't you at least where a button down shirt.
See, I told you my mother doesn’t like East Coasters.
From now on my G-Spot is off limits to you, Bud.
Drawn butter!  Drawn butter!  Everything with you is drawn butter!
Okay, well I didn't see the claws in our prenuptial agreement.
yep.  I have a "sweeet" tail too
One issue is that I love to hold hands.
Pinch someone else, loverboy.
It just seems a bit shellfish to me.
Goosing women is still wrong if you use those, buddy.
Well that was an interesting massage.
Well, I use sunblock, and my hands aren't red.
what  do you mean we are meeting your family at Red Lobster?
It’s a strange way to tell me that you can’t use your credit card this weekend for my shopping!
At least you don’t have clammy hands.
I would have preferred the tail.
I don’t think I’m being unreasonable because I refuse to wear the bib in bed.
It's not my fault. They're not retractable.
How's the moiel business?
It’s just that every time we see Janet and Ted, the claws come out.
When I asked you to shake his hand in a snap, I did not expect you to cut it off.
Couldn't you have, at least, worn trousers for our special occasion?
I can’t believe you even said, ‘There’s no way that’s contagious.’”
Don't think you can claw your way back into my heart.
At least I only  





























"At least I only ACT crabby"
What angers me is the way you handle everything so carelessly"
You need to put the rubber bands back on. That guy you shook hands with might sue."
I'm sick and tired of catching you red-handed.
Yes, my friends in New England adore you, and you never seem to age. But I just can’t get past the fact that you’re a heartless crustacean.”
Look at the bright side
I wish we had gotten the chicken.
Okay, my mother was crabby. You didn't need to grab her like that.
So does this mean our flute duets are over?
Don’t take it personally, some people just don’t like being hugged.
Just to be clear, we are never going out for lobster again
That wasn't in your profile
My friends warned me about you.
We'll settle this over dinner.
I date mobsters, not lobsters.
And another thing. When we talk about money stop referring to dollars as clams.
Picky, picky, picky!
There must be less conspicuous ways to give up texting.
Yeah? well my pussy's market price, and there's a 45 minute wait.
Just keep your claws to yourself!
Why are you always snapping at me?
If we're going to date, you're going to have to wear rubber bands.
After dating for six months, I thought you were ready for a more intimate physical relationship.  I was wrong.
The last time we held hands I lost a finger.
So, how'd you manage the right swipe?  I should have known your profile was too good to be true...
I meant to order lobster from Maine, not lobster les mains! Stupid autocorrect.
A free wish and you go with lobster claws?
Honestly Roger, I finally get why people call you Dependent Clause.”
You're behaving so shellfishly
I’m not picky, but you gave me maybe the worst massage ever.
I'm not selfish! You're shellfish!
You're soaking those things in drawn butter and lemon the second we get home.
If you try to pet another dog, I'm buying some giant rubber bands.
I hope those are imitation lobster.
You dripped cocktail sauce on my dress.
Those stupid lobster pills were supposed to improve your memory.
No! I'm not going to go home and put butter on your claws... I have a headache.
You and your excuses.
It's not that I don't like you personally Jonathan, it's just that I've finally decided to go kosher.
It was this or our first born, Linda
I told my folks you are mostly kosher.
Being Lobsterman is not a superpower to brag about.
Behave or I'll put the rubberbands back on!
You forced me to sit through a labor law lecture just so you could stand up and make a lame 'noncompete claws' joke?
Is it contagious?
It's a bit heavy-handed. Just sayin'.
I can’t believe we’ve been dating for 2 years and you still won’t hold hands
So you clawed your way to the top. I'm supposed to be impressed?
NO I don't carry butter in my purse!
Ralph,when you took the rubber bands off; I thought you wanted to hold my hand!
I don't care what you say, the dishwater was too hot.
And you never text me anymore!
Well, that's still no reason to snap at me!
I told you to stop pinching me!
I said I preferred you when you were cloying.
Your clawing days are over, buddy!
Yes I'm aware that they made a movie about Edward Scissorhands.
Any court in the land would agree with me, it's never just a "little pinch"!
My friend warned me you were cray-cray.
You just don't hold me the way you use to.
Me crabby?  You should talk!
Your back rubs are terrible now.
For a free consultation call 1-800-LOBSTER-HANDS.  Operators are standing by.
Daddy warned me about men with hands like an octopus, but never this!
So, what? You aren't going to hold my hand?
Is it too much to ask that you--just once--touch me without clawing at me!?
I'm done with snapchat.
Damn that auto-correct! On my dating profile I typed that I secretly like ‘mobster’ -types, not ‘lobster’-types.
Well, pardon me, but I thought you said you were a lawyer who worked with mobster laws..."
Next time, try standing outside under a FULL moon.
No, actually, I do not read David Foster Wallace.
I bet if I'd pinched YOUR ass at the party you'd have scream, too!
No! I won't give you a hand job.
Your. profile said you were a blueboood, but I wasn’t expecting this!
Sorry Fred, I don't think this is going to work.
I'm allergic to Shellfish
Your profile on Bumble said you had clammy hands.
I told you not to wear red!
Look I was fine with the claws until you took me to meet your family.
Trying to claw your way back into my heart isn't working.
I wanted to go to Florida, but you had to insist on Maine.
How many stores do we have to go to before we find mittens you like?
It's not you, I just prefer tails.
Didn't I tell you not to shake my father's hand so hard.
I just wish you told you me about the procedure before I got you those nice leather gloves for your birthday.
Butterfingers!
Well, who's stopping you from scuttling across the ocean floor?
I AM––I am keeping my paws off of you.
You asked me to differentiate myself
I know, I know... you identify as a lobster.  But can you stop pinching me then?
Actually, Mark, I believe you CAN help pinching the waitress' butt.
I will say this: your Tinder photo was artfully cropped.
You know, you're really starting to come out of your shell
I knew there was something fishy about your dating profile
Do you wear those to bed too?
I just wish you could have dressed a little better to meet my Mother.
Oh yeah, I'm going to show you a real slow boil.
They better be oven-mitts and not mutations.
Ugh! You’re more and more shellfish every day!
Darling, I told you I was strickly Kosher.
How many times did I tell you not to go snorkeling in Fukushima?
I thought I'd finally caught you red handed!
Okay, okay. We should have gone to Maine on vacation. Now let it go.
All right, you win, sorry I called you crabby
I can't believe your left one isn't bigger.
I'm not willing to give up surf and turf for you.
I said I wanted a prenuptial clause.  You never listen.
‘Are you feeling any less crabby?’
I wish I hadn't married a Cancer.
Fine, nothing but a bib, birthday boy.
Yeah, your profile said you are from Maine.
I just wish you'd let me order lobster once in a while.
From now on, if anyone calls them claws instead of pincers, just suck it up.
You had one wish and you had to be a Flamenco artist?
Don't think you can just claw your way to the top, mister.
You always turn into a crab when I take you shopping.
I guess I understand, but I still think it's rude that you don't open doors for me.
You were paying attention to the pretty one in the lobster tank than you did me.
How come they never have claws in my size?
Yes, you do pinch me in your sleep!
You couldn't be happy just going by Rob?  No, everyone has to call you 'The Robster.'
Wish I could figure out how you were able to post your profile on Tinder
For the last time, I'm NOT going to wear a mermaid tail!!!
Yes, they look delicious, but I still won't go to the Halloween party as "Dish of  Melted Butter."
So long as it's not crabs, do you wanna Netflix and chill tonight?
I told you not to grow that beard!
They're part of  a plea bargain? Why not just register as a sex offender?
You know I have an allergy, and yet you still gave in to your shellfish desires.
Yes, he's my boss, but you shouldn't have shaken his hand.
I was prepared for 'middle crisis" to mean an affair or a corvette, but this?
Look, I just feel there would have been other ways to get out of washing the dishes.
Oh, so I should have just GUESSED that the Red Lobster waitress was also a Gypsy???
I guess now you’ll have to wear those clothes forever.
I have never been so embarrassed, all you had to do was place the ring on my finger.
Would you mind if we kept more of an arms length relationship?
I do love Lobster Thermidor, but I still won't marry you!
I’m sorry I’m an Aries, I don’t get along with people who are Cancer.
It's fine, I guess walnuts are just more important than me.
That was my sister. I told you to keep your claws off her.
Why would I marry someone named Larry
Not only were you handsy, you drew blood.
Very funny. When I said to keep your paws off me I meant it categorically!
Do you have to be SO shellfish?
I don't care if it helps your knees. You need to lay off Chondroitin.
I can't believe you gave me crabs."
No, I’m not holding hands until you boil those things!
Dinner was going fine until one of us couldn't stop dipping our claws in the melted butter.
Oh now we're in a pinch.
NO... I will not wear a bib when I kiss you!
I don't care what the therapist said, you've got to wear those rubber bands at night!
If I'm clamming up then just what do you call what you're doing?
No! We are NOT serving lobster rolls at our wedding reception.
When you said you had to claw your way to the top, you weren't kidding.
Next time, bring me a pair.  I look like an idiot!
Empathy is not looking like them when you eat them.
It’s my hair, isn’t it?
I feel you.
… yeah, but after his radioactive arthropod bite, he could climb walls and wound up with a fantastic movie contract.
Let me see you claw your way out of this situation
What's the point of having claws if you can't help me out when I'm in a pinch?
I can open my own jars, thank you.
You just have to accept the fact that pinching is not a superpower.
I'm disgusted with how my parents treated you at dinner. I knew they were a bit racist, but their clawstrophobia surprised me.
Enough of your Method acting.  Ted was just trying to shake hands.
You really need a better superhero name than lobster man.
You might want to forget about going to dental school.
Something smells fishy. Are you cheating on me?
You're extremely irritating  when you get  crabby.
No, you won't be clawing your way back into my heart.
From now on, just say, 
‘Nice to meet you’, okay?
What else did the hospital say about the witchdoctor's curse?
It’s not Kafkaesque, it’s just annoying and I’m not the one that’s snapping.
You just aren't happy unless you have your claws in everything.
Yes, I know they're cheaper in the summer, but I am certainly not going to spend my entire day shopping for winter gloves.
I wish we had never moved to Brooklyn.
With the cost of EpiPens, I just don't think this relationship is going to work.
My codependent therapist is going to eat this up.
At least my ex only had clammy hands
You said on the dating app your NAME was Claude.
That’s the LAST time we go to Red Lobster.
I had to ask for the biggest one in the tank.
Well, that's certainly the last time I'll ask you to unzip my best ball gown
You're a nice guy and all, but I think I need someone with opposable thumbs."

Anders Bengtson, Minneapolis, MN
You didn't have to snap at the waiter like that
Simmer down? Can't you sea I'm crabby because you're being shellfish?
Last time I’m going glove shopping with you.
I asked you not to wear the jeans shorts.
Just because I said they make me want to dip you in butter doesn't mean you have to wear them everywhere.
I will never ask you again to come with me to an audition!
Maybe the hot tub will put me in the mood.
That's the last time you're ordering the lobster.
You've changed.  You weren't always this crabby.
I'm sorry Michael, but I'm getting pretty tired of your hermit lifestyle.
You said, and I quote "Just take the rubber bands off, it'll be fine.
Are you serious? You are in a movie called “Edward  Lobster-hands”!
Try not to shake hands when you meet my parents.
You  know, when they say "Lobstafest", it's about the food.
I suppose I have to send all the holiday cards again this year?
This is what you get for not reading Yelp reviews beforehand.
It's always the same with your mother–"When are you going to settle down and move to Maine?"
As if your claws weren't noticeable enough - you've now gone used all my nail polish!!
You pinch me one more time with those stupid claws of yours and I’ll be having some drawn butter with them.
If you don't want to hold hands in public, just say so!
I thought you said you got tested when we met.
Eating with your hands goes beyond the pale...
She was dreading the moment the date moved to the bedroom.
Pinch my ass, really?
I just thought the hot butter was over the top.
I don’t know, Dave, you just seem a lot more clingy lately.
I KNOW you said you were in a band, but...
Why are you so crabby today?
Yes, it's #MeToo shaming.
just behave yourself.
That outfit says "I've clawed my way to the bottom."
You’re a hot mess Rob. I’m going to need a bib.
You need to get a grip.
No, my dad was not impressed with your firm handshake.
I miss foreplay.
It's  sort of difficult for me to fully explain Except,  for the time being, I'd rather not hold hands with you.
I suppose it beats "I forgot my wallet"...
I thought you said "clause" not "claws."
You should have told me you were lousy at bowling.  Really! How hard is it to say, "Marg,! I'm all thumbs".
I'm all in favor of you self-actualizing as a crustacean, but you really need to pay that woman's doctor bill.
You're always so picky!
I'm supposed to give up shellfish entirely because you THINK your great grandfather MAY have been a lobster? I want to see that 23andMe report.
Why are you upset? I'm the one who should be in a crabby mood!
I don't care what all of your hipster friends are wearing, they look ridiculous.
What makes you think the FDA drug approval process is compromised?
You really need to read the description of the Specials more carefully.
Your turning into someone I hardly recognize.
Pinch me! I must be dreaming!
I'm steaming mad.
You can't say 'that could be my cousin' every time we eat at Red Lobster.
You told me the will had a clause for you.
Did you have to tell my mother that I bring out the crustacean in you like nobody else?
Not only are they a turn-off,
 they are violation of the emoluments claws.
Don't you snap your fingers at me, mister!
Stop complaining!  The jacuzzi was not too hot
.
Jeez, I said declawed-not neutered!
Can you hail the taxi?
How vain of that shrimp saying that you claud at her!
Just to be clear, going to Red Lobster was your idea.
Everything with you is one step forward and two steps back.
I love you, but no more affectionate pinches on the butt
What am I suppose to think when you could have opted for ankle bracelet monitoring?
I TOLD you Allison was allergic to seafood!
I understand it's a Maine thing, but we live in New York.
I hate when you snap your fingers at me.
Would it kill you to lend a hand once in a while?
Having your tail done before your claws is pure vanity.
If it's cold enough for your fancy mittens, put on long pants.
They could have told us they were allergic to shellfish before inviting us over.
You had to stir the pot, didn't you?
No, I told you. I can't go to dinner with you. I'm Jewish!
Okay but I'm not wearing the bib.
You idiot!  I said "frustration" not "crustacean"!
I should have asked for a full body pic before swiping right...
Did I mention, my horoscope sign is Cancer.
Now I know why all your Tinder photos were taken from the waist up.
Look, keep your claws off of Pamela, or I’ll have to bring the rubber bands on again...
and you think I am a crab...
Using a little moisturizer wouldn't kill you.
When you're out in public you' re supposed to have to have the rubber bands on.
Gosh, I thought this will be some romantic outing.  If you don't want to hold my hand, just say so!
How come we never hold hands?
Just stay away from boiling water.
I don't care how warm it's getting.  We're not moving to Canada!
Don't be like Melania!
Yes dear, I said that I loved lobster, but not the masquerading kind!
You know there are less embarrassing ways to stop smoking.
We're never going back to that sushi restaurant again.
Bigger is not better
I can do crabby just as well as you without the paraphernalia.
No Jerry, I think it is going to take more than gloves to help our relationship.
For the last time, I don't want a back rub.
You should have just taken the to-go box.
There has to be a way for us to hold hands without you snapping at me.
But I told you I would be no good with chopsticks.
When I think that you cannot even swim!
The episode aired over twenty years ago, and besides, Ross was never even good for her.
Who says "I should have been a pair of ragged claws. Scuttling across the floors of silent seas." to a GENIE?
I caught you...
That wasn’t the clause they were referring to.
You're just mad because I look good.
I don't care if they're your hands, you can't bring shellfish to a Hanukkah dinner.
I still think you should have gone with the Santa claws.
It's not you, it's me.  I'm allergic to shellfish.
You can't even carry my shopping bags
I said selfish, not shellfish.
You should see my brother's.
Planning on clawing your way to the top?
Well, I think the surgery was a success.
Why do you do this when we go for seafood?
When we were dating I liked being pinched, but it's getting old.
You could've just bought the flippers.
Snap at me again, Larry, and you'll really be in hot water!
”When the dating-app people warned me I might find an unusual clause or two, I guess I should have taken them more literally.
I kept telling you not to bite your nails, but  --  no  --  you wouldn't listen.
You could have mentioned that you self identify as a crustacean.
You really know how to claw your way out of dinner with my parents
That's not what they meant by "morality clause."
Well, you were right.  You said this time you wouldn't end up half man half fly.
Well I’d love to try that new steakhouse if you weren’t such a penny pincer
When I suggested satiating your midlife crisis, I meant get a Harley or something. You KNOW that I'm kosher!
Jerry, the issue isn’t that you couldn’t find it...
If I’ve told you once I’ve told a million times, Don’t PINCH them!
Jeez, some pro shop!  You’d think that was the first time anyone asked them to drill holes in a bowling ball.
You look like a scavenger!
You’ve changed since we first met
You’ve hit rock bottom. I’m not giving you a hand this time.
I don’t know why you’re offended. I said “keep your paws off me”
You ate a whole Maine lobster in record time and so it was free.  We all get it, Larry.
well, they keep growing back BIGGER!
Right now I could see you with melted butter.
No, a "pair of ragged claws" don't make you seem literate at all.
I can't wait to watch you pee.....
For the last time, No! I will not go to your place to watch Deadliest Catch!
Well we’re definitely getting you a pedicure somewhere else!
I thought you’d do in a pinch.
I’m still not having you over for dinner
OK, “Sea monster” crossed the line, But you were rather snappy
Ted, I told you going as Edward Lobsterhands wouldn't be funny.
I'm not really comfortable with PDA...
And you think I’m the one who’s crabby?
Yes, I'm steamed! I thought you'd be an authority on that.
All I'm saying is you're never gonna find a decent manicurist this far below 23rd
I think I'll have a headache tonight.
You always have to make a show! I mean, who cuts up spaghetti?!!
I told you you'd turn into a lobster if you didn't wear sunscreen.
If you didn't want to hold my hand you should have just said.
Stop it. You know full well why your parents named you Claudius.
And you wait until now to tell me that you can't use chop-sticks?
Just remember to keep your hands to yourself!
No, I will not hold your hand.
You didn't realize when you ordered that our waiter was also a genie?
Like I said, I’ve already asked my parents to leave the hot tub covered during our visit this year.
Pinch my ass one more time, I swear...
I keep telling you that you need to come out of your shell.
It's not you, it's me. . .and that I hate your claws.
That’s it! You’re not going to any more parties without your rubber bands.
And you are a penny pincher too
Why do you always have to ask for melted butter?
Think you are going a little overboard to crack this case
I'm sorry, Dave, but we're having you de-clawed.
I told you not to use the hot tub.
...and I’m sick of you always saying that you’ll get things done “in a pinch.”
That went poorly--why did you have to shake my dad's hand?
You could have sent one picture from the wrist down.
You never give me a hand.
It’s not contagious.
I can't just claw my way to the top like you did.
No, this is just a first date.  I don’t think we should hold hands.
It was fun at first, Finley, but you are always so crabby.
I just always thought you’d get declawed.
Pinch me again and I’ll pound you.
It's me or the kelp granules.
Just be grateful I removed the rubber bands.
I just wish you could stop being so shellfish.
You can sing that Beatle song all you want Bob, it isn’t going to happen.
I told you Harry, either a man hug or a peck on the cheek will do just fine."
Some SuperHero you are if all you can do is crack open nuts.
Did you really just say better red than spread?
Did you ever consider becoming a mohel?
Delicious, yes. Practical, no.
I warned you not to order the GMO lobster.
Don't talk to me about that waitress. Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.
I told you to use sunscreen, but no, you went for the melted butter!
Well, so much for clawing your way to the top.
Do you have to wear them even in bed - you know?
I told you not to forget the nutcracker
Honney, I'm sorry I snapped at you.
I know you hate them, but the rubber bands are there for a reason.
This is what i get from a fisherman's dating site.
Good luck getting to second base.
When you said you were volunteering for a medical experiment, I thought it was for your clogged sinuses.
Sorry Tim, but I'm allergic to shellfish.
You're not the only one who feels crabby sometimes.
You didn't have to set everyone's dinners free.
If you can't handle a puppy, how are we ever going to have kids?
FOR lobster, Kevin. It said I like going out FOR lobster.
There is no such thing as LGBTCrustacean.
I think you're missing the point of the Me Too movement.
So this was what the “big surprise” was to call me away from work?
I caught you red-handed.  You are SO in hot water.
I thought that 'clawing one's way to the top' was a metaphor."
Damn, I forgot the rubber bands again.
You should be scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
It was so embarrassing when you asked for that extra vat of butter sauce.
Your desire to standout is becoming upsetting!
I think they already know you’re from Maine.
Just once you could meet someone and not say "Let's shake on it!"
Don't even think about it tonight.
I don’t care if you did drop those passes, I still think your coach’s punishment is out of line.
Well I hope you had fun.
Your wooing tactics are a little heavy-handed.
Spare me your excuses; I caught you red handed.
Maine-iac, Maine-iac, MAINE-iac.
I don’t care that we already met our deductible, elective surgery is still surgery.
Oh yea, you’ll tell me next your morphing into Santa Claws
You need to claw your way back into reality and stop this fear of being boiled alive.
Feel free to use my hand cream anytime.
Your profile said "built like Wolverine".
You'll be the only one there wearing shorts and a pullover!  I should've stayed home.
I didn't believe you when you said that you'd clawed your way to success.
When I said 'I'll have the lobster' this isn't what I meant.
Look, I'm sorry I called you crabby. You don't need to prove a point.
A handshake?  You couldn't have just high-fived?
No, you defininately may not come up for a drink!
Well I know I told you I’d give you a hand if you got crabby, but I didn’t mean literally!
I guarantee you won't ever get to second base!
You won’t be disappointed. They are ideally shaped for a blended orgasm.
You said it’s a nice seafood place, so I dressed up. What’s the problem?
I told the waiter I just wanted lobster claws, but I think he misunderstood me.
So what exactly is so great about the floors of silent seas, anyway?
You're hard to handle when you get crabby.
But you told me you like lobster.
Turns out 'crabby' isn't a good look on either of us.
Admit it: I caught you red-handed with your secretary so don’’t try to claw your way out of it on a technicality.
Get over it. Our Maine vacation is over.
I told you to keep your dirty claws off her.
You said you wouldn't wear those to meet Mother.

An occasional "thinking of you" text would be nice.
I  guess no bowling today !
For the last time, I know what pescatarian means.
I guess you're all  thumbs too!
Yes, I bought a new handbag. One handbag. How many sweaters have you ruined the sleeves of  *this week*?"
Ugh, at the very least, you could've shaved.
You just had to wave at your friends in front of my friends!
They keep me from biting my nails.
If you ever meet another genie be more specific.
You haven't touched me in weeks.
It's not you, Harry. It's me.
Rubber bands last night was your idea
Stay away from my boobs!
Look, I know we’ve been trying to experiment more in the bedroom, but that hot butter was just too much.
My nipples are still throbbing, you motherfucker!
A class on Origami? Really?
I just don’t understand how some men let themselves get bitten by radioactive lobsters.
How could you be so shellfish?
Christ, Jerry, can’t you wait for Halloween?
Just leave the eyelash next time, okay?
Your pictures on Bumble were very misleading.
So this is what you meant by "Just call me Claude" ...
If you want to hold hands it's going to have to be the soft, rubbery inside part...

I don't know what makes you think this will go any better than your audition for the lead in Edward Scissorhands!
I saw you! You couldn’t keep your claws off of her.
You calling me a crab?
Keep your claws off me!

You are such a penny pincher, John.
You'll never be EDWARD !!!
I told you there’d be bad side effects to that new  drug.
All I said was, let's go for sushi.
Michael, I do not accept that you were transformed by our summer vacation in Maine.
I thought you said your research wouldn't have any negative effects.
You may be neurotic, but at least you're not all hands.
Don't get snappy with me
Harvey, I just don’t know how it’s going to work if you keep going around pinching everyone.
I get it, you think I’m crabby...
Really? Your justification is 'They're not crab hands, they're lobster hands...'
Don't you dare snap at me!
Soft shell my ass!
You didn't have to snap at me like that when I spilled the drawn butter on you.
This relationship isn't working because you're too shellfish!
I just don't like it when you snap at me.
I told you on Tinder ... I'm Santa Claws.
Try as you might I still think you're too handsy.
Why do always have to be so crabby ?
Yeah... I get it, Claude.
First you had the crabs, now you've got the lobsters.
I told you not to watch that Yorgos Lanthimos film again...

We could try a pincer movement.
I just don't know why  you have to be so grabby all the time.
I'm a feminist, but I wish you could open your own doors.
Seriously, was that woman eating out of your hand, or trying to eat your hand?
I told you to stop pinching my ass in public.
Evidently, we have very different ideas of what dinner on me means.
eHarmony spelled it "Claude", dammit.
That's what you get for being a bottom pincher.
I don't see the big deal with  Edward Scissorhands"
I hate when you get snappy.
All I said is I want crab for dinner, and you took it that personally
Don't ever pinch me again!
No I’m still sore from the last time we held hands”..
I expected you to paw me, not claw me.
Just pinch my ass one more time...

I just can’t do this anymore. You’re so grabby.
Hoping to claw your way to the top?
I just wish you would stop being so crabby
I couldn't see your hands on the dating site, but actually they're kind of cute.
It's not going to work - I'm allergic to shellfish.
Not only did I catch you red-handed with her; I now have the worst case of the crabs!
Do that again and it's the nutcracker for you.
I don't see why you have to be so shellfish.
I’ll thank you to keep your feelers to yourself.

How did you even swipe right on me?
Excuses, excuses.
I wouldn't have worn the crab legs if you'd paid me.
I‘m pretty sure you said “Get Out Clause”.
Sometimes I wish you COULD manhandle me!
If you’re the surf, I suppose that makes me the turf!?

You DO understand? No more cuddling.
Right. You “had” to pinch her.
Don't deny it.  I caught you red-handed!
Why do I always have to pick up the check?
When I said I wanted to date a lobsterman, this is NOT what I had in mind
Great experiment! I can never eat crustaceans again.
You never should have asked my sister if you could hold the baby - and offering her a back rub only made things worse!
There's no talking to you when you're being crabby.
I thought we were beyond rubber bands.
I do get so tired of your clawing at me sometimes.
Nothing's been the same with us ever since you clawed your way to the top.
I told you to keep your claws to your self.
Give it a rest--Maine can't be THAT great.

I always said your parents had a sick sense of humor, Sandy.
Don't you want to be more than just a raw-bar tender?
I said aardvark snout. But, oh no, you had to have the lobster claws. Do you have any idea how much it will cost to have your ring re-sized?  And by the way, this isn't a purse. It's an ironic accessory. Burp! I'm your girlfriend!

You promised I could wear those out tonight.
This was NOT  mentioned on your eHarmony profile...
I like intellectual debate too, I just wish you wouldn't tear me apart like that.
My profile clearly said I hate Red Lobster.

There is a limit to "All you can eat."

This is how you impress my father? He owns a 'pawn' shop 
you idiot !
I don't appreciate you always being so snippy.
I don’t care what your excuse is. I want you to take me dancing!
And you wanna be what for Halloween?
well one of us is going to have to change
Ok, Ok, so I was a little  crabby. I've been under a lot of stress. Get over it.
Stop trying to butter me up
You can just be so crabby
Contract claws my ass!
Having giant lobster claws does not automatically increase your "net worth."
I'm so tired of the seafood lover in you...
You don't have to be so Crabby! Get over it!
You sure spent a LOT OF MONEY at the Manicurist this month..
You don’t have to bring your work home with you.
Surely there were other ways to become Master of Your Domain.
I should had listened to my friends when they told  me I was kissing the wrong animal at the bar.
Don't think this gets you out of being caught red-handed.
Don't butter me up just break it off with me.
I told Cheryl to set me up with a guy that wouldn't get too handsy but his is ridiculous.
Let's see you claw your way out of this one!
Of corse I’m upset, you’re shellfish
If that's your super power, all I can say is Wolverine you ain't.
It’s fine if you don’t want to get dressed up but you could at least be a little less crabby.
You never said you were allergic to seafood.
Yes, you should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas!
I Still don't understand why you couldn't have opened the door for me!
A manicure is not an unmanly thing.
I told you not to touch that, you don't know where it's been and I told you to wash your hands but did you listen to me no because you never listen to me and I don't see why I always have to be the one to clean after your mistakes because you nev .
This is the last time I bail you out of jail for your lobster's rights protests.
You say I'm crabby, but look in the mirror!
No, I will not stop calling you cray-cray now.
And I thought Edward Scissorhands was a bad date
I wish you'd get your own nail polish.
At least you're not wearing your Hulk hands.
For the second time, your hands are NOT clammy!
I'd have accepted your proposal had you not shot those rubber bands at me.
Now that you've clawed your way to the top, what's next?
You didn't have to scream when you slipped into the hot tub with me...
I needed you in a pinch and you weren't there.
I talked about Michelangelo till I was blue in the face; I told you nobody was going to get my Mrs. Prufrock costume. Next T.S. Eliot Theme Night we're going as Practical Cats and be done with it.
I'll be your emotional support lobster. Everybody has them nowadays, they'll never know." You know, my mother was right about you
I said, 'there ain't no laws when you DRINKING Claws'
But what is this saying about me?
I’m afraid my old-school New England family might eat you alive.
And don't even consider heavy petting at this point in our  relationship.
I know you’re upset - I just can’t put a finger on why
Its not like I'm the only one being crabby.
Hands or claws; keep them to yourself
Dear New Yorker:  this cartoon should not be published, because there is actually a birth deformity similar to this image.
Either you drop them, or I’ll drop you.
The oven mitts fit. They might not acquit.
This is not what I expected when said you were clawing your way up the corporate ladder, Simon!
And I'm telling you they don't actually mate for life, they've got harems
If you embarrass me like that one more time, I'm going to get the rubber bands out again.
You've got to face facts:  you may be the best hand model in town, but your range is limited.
How could you think my vegan parents would that funny?
I just don't understand why that restaurant offers everyone garlic butter except us.
I'm sorry but this is it. The foreplay is horrible and butter leaves grease stains on the sheets!
Damn it, Brian. You are not my lobster, I said it's over!
I told you not to order the soup.
It is certainly NOT making me any less irritable!
That crab was so overpriced!
Don't get snippy with me again.
Blind dates never work out for me.
I said I'd edit the dependent clause and you should take on the main clause ... not the MAINE CLAWS!
Summer's over. You're holding on to the beach vibe too long!
I thought your online profile said "mobster", not "lobster"!
It’s just that my last boyfriend couldn’t keep his paws off of me.
I’m about to snap.
I always feel like a fish out of water with you..."
Next time, keep your claws to yourself!
I know your nickname was "Larry, the Lobster" in high school, but you're 42 now and it's really time to give up the lobster mitts.
You have to stop playing with your food.
They never even try getting your pronouns right
With that attitude, you bet one of your claws is going to grow bigger.
If you try to hold my hand once more, the rubber bands are going back on.
No more birthday parties at Red Lobster.
You've seen that damned movie too many times.
Relax—just because I'm upset with you doesn't mean I'm going to boil you alive.
I told you I’m allergic to shellfish.
Try that one more time when we're with my friends and the pegs are going right back in.
How many times do I have to tell you not to leave home without rubber bands?
I said you need a cause, not claws.
I work so hard to claw my way to the top! A little support would ne nice! Do you always have to be so shellfish?
Don’t get snippy with me! I caught you red-handed!
This is why I don’t like you drinking with your friends.
I wish you would stop shaking hands and just hug people.
You"res wearing king when I"m in a hermit mood.
But I don't want to be in a roll.
And how is my mother supposed to knit gloves for those?
I said I’d go if they’d SERVE lobster, not if you’d BE a lobster!
"Are you crabby?"
It is really time you decide whether you are a left handed or right handed pincher.
YOU CANNOT JUST CLAW YOURSELF BACK INTO MY HEART
You don't literally need claws in order to claw your way to the top.
There’s nothing you can say. I caught you red-handed.
I hate it when you save the best part for later eating.
You forgot the butter and lost the car key? How could you!
Damn it, I can't dress you forever!
Well at least I’m not clammy.
You don't have to be so crabby all the time.
Keep your slimy claws away from me!
This is ridiculous!  You think you can walk down 5th avenue with a pair of lobster claws on and people won't say anything.  
Yeah, right.  They just think and know you're a raving IDIOT.
I distinctly said “Santa Claus”.
You're never gonna claw your way to the top wearing shorts.
This wasn't what I expected when your profile said "Heavy Handed"
You are the most shellfish person I have ever met.
You just have to touch everything, don't you?
It's not you I don't like, Brad. It's that snappy tone you use.
We are NEVER going to Red Lobster again.
If we don't find you a shell  to live in you'll just have to come back to the apartment.
Yes, I remember. I did agree to a marriage clause
Oh, and what would've you spent your lottery winnings on?
Well I thought the genetic testing guy was quite insulting!
It’s not an excuse to pinch everyone.
Don’t tell me “ it’s out of my hands”
Go ahead!  You said you wanted freedom to grab all you wanted.
So, this is your brilliant plan to claw your way to the top? Really??
The relationship is over, don't try to claw your way back in!
I said I wanted to have a lobster dinner but of course you had to overdo it.
I tried removing them but they just grew back.
You're spending way too much time at the beach.
Don’t be so sensitive. My father always asks for extra melted butter with dinner.
You really need to start coming out of your shell.
Just because your name is Claude? You could have gotten a T-shirt!
I said stop being so "selfish"
I feel it's best if we keep our relationship platonic.
Put those away, you look ridiculous
How dare your mother treat me like that --now I'm steamed!
You keep saying that. Next time maybe just wear a collared-shirt.
As usual, you have it all backwards again!
Remind me to never, ever, make out with you again!
Should have ordered the chicken.
Jeez!  Don't you know that there's the pincer claw and a much larger crusher claw?
Your mom was a real crab.
Fine.  I won’t try to hold your hand in public anymore.
I don't care if my dress was wedged in or not!
I hate holding your hand when you're being such a crab."
You've been spending way too much time in Maine.
I'm so tired of this heat.
Jill bitterly regretted not checking the prenup after her request to add an extra clause...
It's from my mother's side
I knew they’d kick us out.
What was I thinking - introducing you to Ms. Butterfingers?
When I said “full disclosure,”  I meant full in the context of online dating.
You and red wine do not pair well.
Don't you dare get snappy with me!
First stop, my manicurist.
Listen I know you're in a pinch but you don't have to be so hard-shelled
No I will not call you 'David Pincer'
I get it.  You're a freak.  But do you have to be so crabby about it?
Stop being such a crab, John.
That is the most pathetic boxing outfit I have ever seen.
I know you are a good catch but you don't have to act so crabby.
I WISH YOU WEREN"T SO SHELLFISH
No, I’m not holding hands.
We'd still be together if you weren't so shellfish.
There must be a clause in the pre-nup...
No more foreplay.
I told you to keep your CLAWS off me
No Claude, I will not "check your nose".
And to make matters worse, your parents named you Claude!
We talked about this, you were to grabby in bed.
Don't  try to claw your way back into my affections.
Keep your filthy claws off of me!
It's over, John. I told you on our first date that I was kosher!
I’m sorry. I thought it was a kind of manicure.
Dominance hierarchies be damned! You want something you gotta grab it with both claws!
So much for adding color to marriage. I’m a redhead and no one will ever know.
OK, now you can claw back that money we lost.
I can't believe how shellfish you are!
What are you so crabby about?
You love the B52's more than you love me!"
Want to play grab ass?
Claws you're mine"
You'll wear those 'til you stop pinching waitresses.
I’m not mad. I have claws-trophobia.
You should have warned me about the crabs.
No, I didn’t forget the butter. Why?
Next time I pick where we eat. The kids officially have enough lobster mitts!
I  didn't pick red.
I meant I was in the mood for a lobster roll not a stroll
I just don't like public displays of affection.
We will NOT have a cheering section at the next Bris.
I can't take you anywhere!
We are never doing foreplay again
I'm so tired of you using your clawdicap as both an excuse and a means for attention.
No, I don’t think it’s “cool.”
I can't BELIEVE he's wearing shorts
Oh, I'M being crabby?
Did you have to tell everyone you clawed your way to the top?
We'll never be allowed back.
And you think I’m being crabby!
I hope you won't expect me to participate in your personal hygiene!
NEXT time, it'll be McDonalds!! Hear me, Buster???
I think you are going to have to claw your way to the top if you want to get anywhere...
My last relationship boiled me alive.
I didn't say "pinch her".
Talk about clawing your way to the top!
I said that if I wanted to live dangerously, I should have married a MOBSTER!
I told you to stop, but at least your eyes didn't go bad.
That’s your whole plan? To scuttle across the floor of silent seas?
When I said you were ‘too handsy’ on our  first date, I didn’t expect this kind of reaction.”
Edward Scissorshands was better.
You've been so crabby recently
I might be hangry, but you’re the crabby one.
Stage five of the Kabourophobia treatment plan.
Do you want the rubber bands back on? Then, shut up!
Sorry, I prefer calamari.
Yes, I call that ‘foreplay’.
Look, Donald, it may be O.K. to pinch a kitty, but...
I can hardly wait until you've finished molting.
I just hate it when they require formal attire.
Is this how you plan on clawing your way to the top?
And all these years I called you “Ham Handed”.
I'm having serious issues with your #metoo therapist.
But our anniversary slipped your mind.
I prefer to think of myself as upper crust.
Sorry I couldn't pick up the tab.
I wonder if my dating app has a clawback feature?
Now I see why you never text me back--pure shellfishness!
Why in the world would you ask for "crab claws only" !
I still think boxing gloves would be more effective.
I said, at least a 5 ft distance!
Last week you ordered pig's feet.  Today, crab claws.  What'll it be  next week...beef tongue?
I'm sick of getting thrown out of every restaurant that has a lobster tank that you feel the need to dive into.  AND THEN, blaming it on a zagillion years of  DNA programming!
I've told you a thousand times my dad collects *mobster* memorabilia.
Of course I'm upset! They *know* we don't eat shellfish!
If this is how you come to our first date, I wonder what you'll look like for a divorce.
‘You’re not clawing your way out of this one, Dennis.’
Face it, John! Being caught red handed usually results in an arrest.
You were lucky I was here to vouch for you!
Don't pull your J. Alfred Prufrock act again.
That's it for me!  Absolutely no more internet dating!  And I'm getting an app that can block incoming hands-free texts!  Claude, another thing:  Don't you get why you should change your name?!
Aw, c'mon! I thought Crustacean was a sect. And you open jars for a living?
Your scarlet pincers are just as embarrassing for me.
What were you saying about Gregor Samsa?
Not funny, 'Rock Lobster' is so passe'
#fallsoutclawsout is never going to trend, Brad.
No, I have no idea how you got crabs!
jefhrbgyfvbgyrhnb9geryheuejhutrhfhtgerhfvtre3fygfretchnjdkslkdjfn
So you don't hold hands in public and you don't drive. I don't see how this date can possibly get any worse.
I can’t believe Betty served crab bisque.
No, I had fun too...it’s just that some women don’t enjoy having their breasts played with.
Before “Me Too”, I occasionally liked it when you pinched me.
I'm just saying, I feel like I'm hiding under a rock with you.
Okay - so I didn't say keep your CLAWS off me
Harold, I've told you a dozen times, I won't date a guy with the crabs!
Once the primaries begin the electorate starts looking more closely at potential first spouses.
I thought shaking hands was a socially acceptable custom for a first date.
No, I do not want a hug !!
How are things at the office?
I swear-- you'll do anything to not hold hands in public.
They were out of tails, really?!
No. We are not having lunch at a Kosher deli.
Just keep your hands off me!
Pinching is so passé
You know, you’ve been acting really crabby lately.
You should try to be less shellfish sometimes
You say they’re big in Brooklyn. But are they vegan?
That’s not an excuse—so am I!
You just "forgot" to bring the rubber bands, huh?
That damn genie sure took things literally
Jon E. Kensington, CA
My mother worked at Red Lobster.
I’m sorry I snapped at you
You’ve just been really, I dunno...clingy.
A bisque? Is that what you called me? So what do you mean by that?
I thought 'tenacity' was an admirable quality in your profile!
I hope we get home before you change any more
You say your name is Edward Scissorclaws?
I wish you hadn't put those claws in our prenup.
I tried to call you
I just HATE it when you're a crab.
I hope you're not planning on being crabby all evening...
I thought Edward Lobsterhands was just his name!
Well then, un-boil them.
You didn’t have to get so snippy with me!
You could at least stop trying to grab the check.
You know I don’t like it when you act shellfishly.
Foreplay is difficult
2That saleswoman was practically salivating over you.
I’m tired of clawing my way up in the Firm!
How did you even set up a Tinder profile with those things?
Get a rubber band.
Ok !No groping
Nobu doesn’t think it’s funny.
I don’t think it’s funny.
They all KNOW you're a blue blood, Timothy; no need to accentuate it.
You just had  to make fun of the lobsters in the tank didn't you?
This superhero stuff is getting out of hand
Stop snipping at me.
I must hand it to you—you do act normal.
God I’ll be glad when Lobtober is over.
I get it. You're a lobsterman. Literally!
I told you eating shellfish always gives you a bad reaction!
You are always coming up with excuses to avoid rubbing my feet!
Since you insisted we declaw the cat, it's time we do the same to you.
They said you could keep the bib!
When my friends say anything, you take their heads off.
It's nickels, dimes, and the dollars that we have to worry about, not just pinching pennies.
I know your dating profile said you were a little crabby but I'm still surprised.
So you think you can claw your way to the top in those clothes?
Why don't you just go and scuttle across the floors of silent seas?
You never want to get sushi.
I'M not the one who's being crabby!
I bet you think you can claw your way to the top again
I regret telling you that you remind me of Colin Farrell.
Your texting skills are horrendous.
No need to ask what your superpower is.
I don't care if you say they're retractable.
You promised me not to go on stage during the B52's Rock Lobster"
You’re definitely in hot water with me.
I’m not going to put up with the crabby attitude you’re giving me today, Bob.
Let’s not hold hands for now.
If you sing Rock Lobster one more time, I'm out of here!
FOREPLAY????  I have 16 stitches and PTSD!
Next time, warn me before you reach for a loose button on my blouse.
How about peel and eat shrimp for dinner followed by a game of Jenga?...for money
Your territory is not in need of expansion Brian.
I'm not so keen on the shorts, but you could at least have worn a shirt with a collar.
It’s obvious why I ask you to tie my shoes
I said no PDA!
Just please don’t make me wear the stupid bib in public
Ugh you never hold my hands in public
Toxic clawsculinity.
Uh, I don't remember you mentioning those in your profile on Match.com.
I’ve told you time after time...you are not a plumber!
You could have dressed nicer to meet my parents.
I just feel like I’m crawling backwards in circles with you.”
I thought you said they might get “clammy.”
The only place you coulda been a contender is on the waterfront.
I heard you were frugal, but you’re a downright penny-pincher!
Worst finger-bang ever!
It felt like the Rothsteins were glaring at you all dinner.
I'm not the only one who's crabby today"
Her: "I'm crabby"
Him: "You too, huh?"
When you want me to buy bread please stop asking me to "pinch a loaf".
The game was yesterday, Brian.
I should have listened when my mother said marry a rich one, not a po-boy
Why would you think it was okay to introduce me as 'Turf''?
Yeah, well, I think that Gregor Samsa would have at least been courteous enough to put this on his profile.
Don't try to claw your way to the top  mister, #Metoo.
I will not dip your hands in butter when we hold hands in movie!
You are such a shellfish penny pincher.
For the last time, tickling is NOT my love language.
Taking it 'to go' seems to mean something different to you"
Trust me, the superhero look is not working!
Hah!  YOU'RE calling ME crabby?!
Butter sauce? Really>
Look, I just thought that finishing with a pinch was the way to go.
Now is not the time to butter up to me.
I'm sorry I'm the one to tell you Larry, but you lost your grip back there.
If that's your idea of foreplay...
You couldn't do a boxing  workout?
If you think you can claw your way back into this relationship, you've got another thing coming, and I don't mean a tail.
I’m disappointed Gerald, I thought you of all people should have been able to win me that stuffed animal.
So much for foreplay now!
Hmph! Your profile said "merman".
As soon as you saw Sheila, you just couldn't wait to get your claws on her.
I am not putting on my sexy lingerie.  What’s the difference?  We are out of butter sauce anyway.
I swear, I'm not contagious.
Keep snapping at me and you may find yourself in some VERY hot water.
We need to get out more....I'm tired of living like a hermit.
definitely no nipple play tonight OK !
“Please do not anything about clawing your way out of this one.”
You're taking the hands off clause too literally.
No, no, no.  It was an idiom, and I just wanted you to put a little more energy into your career.
No, my profile said I like White Claw!
Where's the rest of the poor thing?
Let’s go to MY restaurant, you said. We’ll have a fun time, you said.
You had to cut the blue wire didn't you...
Let me be absolutely clear, you're not my taste in men!
Am I out of hot water yet?
I told you not to wear the knee-length shorts.
I thought your profile said that you were slightly SELFISH!
You could have at least warned me about your family.”
When I asked you to be more spontaneous, this is not what I had in mind.”
Keep your claws off of me, you freak!
I was embarrassed by how you ate all those frog legs.
I know you had to claw your way to the top, but I don't like the trade-off!
I’m not saying you’re catfishing me, I just think you should have put your claws in your profile.
How about we discuss the phrase 'hold me tight' for starters....
Sure, NOW it's obvious the adoption agency was double-checking that I had "read THE clause," but you've got to admit the voicemail was tough to decipher.
You’re too rough when it comes to playing around down there.
And now I have a case of the crabs.
Nope, no grope.
You’re shellfish in bed.
You're as aloof as your brother Edward.
Sorry darling, it's not my fault that I'm a catch.
Honestly,it's the wearing shorts to dinner that annoys me the most.
One little joke about your hands and you go MAGA on me.
You have a lot of nerve to call me a ‘crab’!
Claw Hand Luke? Jean Clawed Van Damme?"
No, you're the one who's crabby!!
I'm not 'crabby', I'm not 'boiling mad', I just want to go home, OK?
Never before in my life have I had to get my vagina fumigated after third base.
We have to get you better mittens.
Not every problem can be solved with "a pinch of salt."
You ALWAYS feel like seafood. I want a burger.
Why does stuff always have to happen to me?
Every time one of my friends has nearly climbed out of the tank, you reach up and pull them back down.
We just have to face it. You’ve been typecast.
You'll wear them until I say, you can take them off.
At least we could hold hands when you were a Cheesehead.
No, I didn't notice the "Lobster Clause" in your contract!
You're sleeping on the couch until you claw your way back from this one.
That's the last time I let you give me a 'massage.'
Who am I in your little fantasy? Mrs Claws?
Obviously, he should be impeached. I'm just worried the proceedings will hurt the elect -- wait, did you forget to take off your oven mitts again?
I would NEVER ask you to be something you're not. I said stop being"selfish".
I don't want the whole lobster" you said.
"I just want the claws"  you said
It’s not what you said. It’s your table manners.
All I said was I don't like you clawing at me in public.
Absolutely NO ONE believed in you’re in the Broadway cast of ‘SpongeBob SquarePants!’
I can’t believe you let her bait you like that.
Why can’t you just pinch like a normal pervert?!
This doesn’t help me decide whether I’d look good with a lob.
Why you can't behave like everyone else?
Pinch me again and you'll literally be in hot water.
I'm sorry. It was a pinch decision!
This is why we can't have nice things.
Yeah, the street view van is coming, you couldn't just go with the horse head like everyone else?
Well, that makes two of us now.
For God’s sake, we are just going to see your  mother-in-law
You’re endangered, and you never told me?!
I don't care what they cost , you are not touching

 me with those claws!!
Even after I reminded you to take your allergy medication.
The last place I want to be with you is in hot water
That wasn't the shocker I was expecting.
I'm just saying you ought be less crabby at dinner.
I'm tired of being called the crabby one in this relationship.
I’ve told you many times, Larry; if you insist on holding my hand in public, use your pincer!
NO!!!! This is not an acceptable alternative to keeping your clammy hands off of me!!!!!!!!
Claude why must you take everthing so literal?
I don’t care how manly you feel: long shorts are passé.
I'll bet you find them handy in a pinch!
I told you not to pinch that witch, "Your Boss."
How did you get your shirt on without stretching it?
You didn’t tell me you sucked at foosball?!
First thing I want to do is boil some water.
No--you're not dressed right to meet them.
Couldn’t you just get the crabs like everyone else?
You could have wished for beef tongue.
OK OK — I get it — no wedding rings
Did the doctor say when you’d transform into a ‘Lobster Man’, with a job?!!
I still don't want to move to Maine.
I told you using gene modification to fix your hand problem was a bad idea.
I thought you said it was just a hobby.
How about we just this once consider the girlfriend?
Do not pinch my tush again!
I can’t believe you dropped the ball
I hope you are pleased with yourself.  And to think, that was your third wish!
Tell me again how you became so successful?
How will you claw your way out of that one, Harry?
You know "Pinch a Ginger Day" isn't mandatory, right?
It’s not our fault she’s allergic.
Discover your very own Maine thing.
I get why your Tinder profile only consisted of headshots
What do you want me to do? The sunscreen washed off.
I just don't like being in a pinch.
So now you're a Kafka fanboy?
''For god's sake, Dave. Get those things removed.''
Yeah, yeah, it's your 'spirit animal"
Look!  Just because we're from Maine and your brother-in-law likes to brag about how  your sister's mittens look like Michigan when he's drunk doesn't mean you have to go down that same rabbit hole.  And it's too warm for mittens anyway!
Looking for a life partner
Come on John, get a grip -- you're over 30
You owe me a new lamp.
Okay, I'll keep them off of you. However they're claws not paws and they're not dirty.
You always grab the dessert before I can get a bite.
I'm pregnent with your crustacean.
Ya think you're some big superhero, gonna take the law into your own claws.
I'm done venting.  You can put your claws away.
Please don't ever pinch me again.
I don't know Rob, I'm pretty sure the invite said Kafka-ESQUE!!
You've really taken this 'All you can eat thing' too far."
What kind of hot water are you in now?
Could you not just wear mitts like a normal person?
You think I'm EVER going to let you feel me up again?
Since you insist on being all 'crabby and grabby' you might as well dress the part!
It was a horrible date. The restaurant didn’t have drawn butter and you were a bit handsy with the server.
My voicemail said I think we need to talk about you being selfish, not shellfish.
They said, 'Pincer,' not 'Pinch her.'
You really have to always grab the best parts, don't you!?
Why do you ask if I'm familiar with David Foster Wallace?
I wished you stop being so shellfish all the time.
Of course it hurt!
Of course I feel duped! I thought "Art" was short for Arthur, not Arthropod!
Yes, Michael. Nova Scotia was a long time ago. Why do you persist in bringing it up?
Molting season ended on Labor Day, you really need to find a new stylist.
Really? You actually thought this would help you “claw” your way to the top?
I liked it better when you were just ham-handed.
I'm through with X-Men.
Actually, we are quite compatible.
Well, I thought the surgery was a success.
I'm sure you can relate to feeling crabby.
That's not what I meant when I said I wanted crab claws.
I emailed you the audition sheet, Tim. Which part of ‘CLAUS, The Musical’ did you NOT understand?
If you didn’t feel the need to stick your claws in everything, we could stay at parties longer.
How could you just stand there while he had his paws all over me?
Just keep walking straight ahead

Lobsterman is just not a super hero!
Sorry if I'm being a little shellfish!
And another thing, stop picking lint off my collar!
Right.  You traded with the lobster because you thought it would be interesting hear it play the violin.  Then it swam away with my violin and I'm just supposed to explain this to my conductor.  Maybe you could come along for back up.
You're in hot water David.
I know your clammy hands were an issue. But, this is not the right solution.
The pincer movement was supposed to be very effective, but he was starting to have his doubts.
So... We're not holding hands on this date?

She was right. Around women, you're all claws.

Cape Cod baseball season is over. Would you please take them off now?
Why? Claws I said so.
I appreciate the irony of cheering for a minor league baseball  team called the Rock Lobsters, but I just can't sit through one of their games with you.
Believe me. It's a lot more than just not being able to find gloves.
I should have listened to my mother...
You're the one who told me to act more selfish sometimes, I just misunderstood at first.
Your obsession with seafood is getting embarrassing!
I'm sorry, I'm just not comfortable walking hand in claw.
I'm sorry, but there's just no excuse for you not wearing your wedding ring.

Seriously?! You lost your hands in a seafood shop?
All I said was that I wanted to get closer to the ocean... you took this too far!
Holding hands, yes, that's romantic. Losing a finger, not so much.
You could have mentioned them on your profile
When you wrote "Consider the Lobster"  on the dating site, I thought you meant the book.
Okay I know I said I wanted a man who wasn’t “all hands” in the ad but this isn’t what I meant.

This time, keep your hands to yourself!
I wanted you to come out of your shell

I'm sorry, but they're just not kosher.
I don’t know what was more embarrassing - the cargo shorts of you picking a fight with “Mr. Big Foam Hulk Hands”.
I don't care how difficult it is. I won't go in another public rest room with you.

Do you have to take everything I say so literally?
What clause in the prenup?
Don’t ever expect to get to second base with ME.
So, tell me why you thought the lobster claw transplant was a good idea?
When you looked into the lobster's eyes, screamed "It's my mother!" and waved those fake claws in the air, did you expect them to laugh?  You owe me for the check and your bail.
Don’t be so crabby!
I knew it was too soon to take you out of the tank

GO SCRATCH
I knew removing your tape in there was a bad idea.
I told you the fish supplements might not work

Eventually, global warming is not only going to change the entire Ecco system, but us humans as well.
I'm just saying, it's a kid's soccer game. You didn't have to shout "Rock Lobster!" every time they made a goal.

You never hold my hand anymore. 
Why are you so shelfish, all of the sudden?

So I told your cousin Shelly to keep his clammy hands to himself.
I said I wanted a boyfriend with Roman hands, not Lobster paws!
From now on you wear the rubber bands whenever we go out, NO exceptions

You and your penny pinching!

The drugs are getting the best of you, Jimmy
I told you to put sunblock on your hands.
Bob,why do you always insist on singing 'Happy Talk' at the Karaoke?

Geez.  It was just a compliment.  I'm not trying to "butter you up."
My mother was only kidding when she said you reminded her of Santa Claws.
Are you still not talking to me? is it the claws?
I think about how, with just a pinch of ambition, you would have been such a  natural to claw your way to the  top.
I'm sorry I reacted that way at dinner, I just have this phobia about drawn butter.

They’re not the only things that get bigger when you molt...
I told you before - don't try to shake hands with the Maitre-d.
I get it- you're sick of lobster roll".
You don't have to walk me all the way, Dad. You're really clamping my style.
So, you're feeling trapped?
Have you ever wondered why everything’s in grayscale except for your lobster-claw hands?
This is not what I meant when I said stop being so handsy in public!
I'd like to try something besides seafood for a change.
Don't you dare call me crabby...
I feel like you're always snapping at me
Roy, you snap at me again and I’ll boil you!
You have to stop clawing me!
Did you have to grab me by the claws like that?
I told you no one is old enough to understand a twist on that Jergens ad.
Now who’s in a crappy mood?
I’m glad you listened to me about clawing your way to the top.
I don't care if it is a medical condition, there's no reason to treat my mother that way.
If you don’t walk behind me I will go back to the apartment and get the rubber band and put it around your arms.
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you earlier.
Please don’t put your claws on me again!
O.K., you're not too handsy.
Maybe I wasn't supposed to be here. I did.
Keep your filthy claws off my silky drawers.

Look, I know you say I can be snappy, but this is a step too far.
I don't know. Phoebe says your just not my lobster.
I don't know whether to kiss you or crack you!
I can't believe you even touched that witch!
Being a pincher doesn’t make you much of a catch.
So, you have just arrived from Maine?
I told you they wouldn't give you a discount at Red Lobster just because you wore lobster hands.
Again with the glove shopping?
You're there.  You don't need the crabby import.
Imagine if you had ordered the Napoleon for dessert!
Honey, yes you may feel safer this way but so do lobsters after their rubber bands are removed...
No, you can't claw your way back into our relationship.
It’s not Halloween yet and you are already snapping!
We used to be close, hold hands. Now I just pretend I don’t know him.
When I said i want lobster for dinner, I did not mean this....
You think you're steamed?
I hate crabby hands! All they're good for is grabbing you.
I told you to keep your clammy hands off me.
White claws don't have foam, Dan.
Spare a doller for a Crust-Bum?
It give me Paws for concern!
Let it go honey, it's not as bad as the Mites touch.
No, you're NOT my lobster, Mark."
Is something wrong? You're looking steamed.
Won't get ME into hot water," you said. "Hah!
You're not clawing back that prenup!
They're not an excuse to pinch my butt.
Yes, I saw the movie, amd no, I'm not going with you.
... and after you'd repaired washing machine the drum started to circle in opposite side.
We've seen "The Giant Claw" a hundred times.  Tonight it's "Mamma Mia" or I'm leaving you.
I said you should try White Claw.
There's no such clause in our marriage contract.
I feel clawful for you.
Let me guess—another night of grab and go?
Everything I touch turns to crab.
I'm sorry I ordered the lobster paté,but you have to understand that I'm a human.
I'm going home alone. You've been clawing at me all night!
Honey, what's the matter?" "You're just so shellfish.
At least I’m not a furry...
My sister said you were crabby, but shellfish too? Ugh.
I just can't make up my mind if your crustaceous extremities will match my new outfit or not.
Foreplay isn't what it used to be.
I knew the dollar store was not a good idea"
You butter not pinch me again
I can’t believe we spent $20 on those things at that salad bar.
You are looking sooo claimable
Dinner is served, honey.
I wasn’t asking if you were literally a catfish.
Let’s go to couples counseling, he says....
Do you really expect me to believe this was your lawyer’s idea?
No, we are not moving to Maine and this 
‘Crush and Seize manifestation exercise
is getting totally out of hand.
You’ve been so snappish lately...
I didn't ask for a supervillain in this relationship.
For you to do this, just because you thought I was going to buy you gloves again..."
Thanks to you, we were caught red-handed.
I should have heeded my girlfriend's warning about you being all claws.
No!  I won't give you a hug.
You're always so crabby on date night.
Yes I got your text. What the hell is ogtcg9otupiu?
Geez Gary, you watch one episode of Friends and now this is who you are?
I've been catfished before, but this is rediculous!"
You are such a crab.
If you pinch my fanny one more time, you're really going to be in hot water when we get home!
I’m not adding your new claws to our relationship agreement.
You’ve given caught red handed an entirely new meaning.
What possessed you to say "lobster claws!"  to that genie?
Don’t even think it.  No clawing out of this mess.
Does that mean the lobster got your hand?
So now they all know you hate meat.
If you weren’t so shellfish, maybe this relationship would work.
Yes, I love FRIENDS, too, but that doesn’t Mean your “my lobster.”
There's nothing funny about your hands!
I said I love the crab claws at Onnyoo Grill, not on you!
Huh! Don’t think you are going to claw your way back.
If this is what you wanted all along I suppose I should feel vindicated...
You’re  always snapping at me.
Why men great 'til they gotta be great.
You're awfully cocksure for a two-legged lobster. I might rather marry a mobster.
This John -Claude Van Damme thing has gone too far.
When I said I would only date a man with big hands that isn’t what I was thinking
Next time, skip the handshake.
I knew my parents wouldn’t approve. So what if you’re not kosher?
No, I’m not going to hold your Halloween candy bag for you.
I'm not changing my menu, regardless of your hints.
I think you've taken 'clawing your way to the top' just a little too seriously!
OK, so even if he did get the Nobel Prize, do you have to take him that literally!?
Talk about being in a pinch.
Okay, I see your point. But I really didn’t know that white wine was to be ordered with shellfish.
I said "NO," but you kept clawing.
This just isn’t what I meant when I said that you’re my lobster.
Those claws were definitely not part of our pre-nup!
Lobster-man and woman don't match, do they?
I am not interesting in having anyone try to claw their way into my heart, thank you very much.
I can’t believe you’re comparing your ‘White Claw identity’ to gender fluidity.
You're not the only one who's steamed
Don’t ever lay your claws on me either!”

I hate how you never follow through.
Are you sure you clicked  “Save in iCloud”?
So,your name isn't "Claude"?
And I thought you were a good catch.
With global warming effects on the fisheries, I bet you're quite concerned about your family's future?
So you're telling me every one of the high priced lawyers I had on the call misunderstood you about the amended clause.
Louie, why are you being so crabby?
You weren't supposed to take those.
You're a glad-hander crustacean and nothing more!
How many times have I told you the tail is the best part!
Was it necessary to show everyone you're a hick from downeast Maine?
Yeah, well, you could have asked me if I wanted lobster hand transplants too.
This won't make Tom Brady notice you.
I can’t believe they don’t serve lobster claw!
You may be feeling crabby, but you won't claw your way out of this one.
Have you tried dating on Snappy dot com?
C'mon, Larry, get a grip.
"I'm not with you in your craven and premature urge to readapt to aquatic life..."
She says” keep your hands to yourself and we will have a great night”.
Every time we visit my parents you get so snappish.
You've got some nerve telling ME I'm being crabby!
This is so not what I meant when I told you to get over your White Claw obsession.
When I searched for someone who could get a good grip on things, this is not what I had in mind.
You should have told me you had crabs
I’m sorry, but playing 60s theme songs..?
A castanet player you’ll never be
I didn't like how you snapped at me!
You think I’m the one who can’t feel intimacy?
Just saying...security is alot tighter at Lobster-Con now
No I don’t care how much melted butter you have! I’m not eating your hands pervert!
Let me guess...surf 'n turf again?
I really regret telling you to claw your way to the top.
That marriage counselor seemed wicked smaht!
Not sea food again.
This is just our first date. Keep your meat hooks off me
Is the world really ready for Jean Clawed Van Damme?
Humph!! They'll be no romance tonight Walter!!
Not what I meant when I said I’d like some lobster tonight.
No claw back; you earned that bonus.
It is really time for you to get over being a beach bum.
Why do you have against Red Lobster?
Crabby, huh?
Fine, don't hold hands, but this is going too far!
It's a fish fry, not a costume party
I still don't understand why you spent our abortion money on props for your little open-mic, like anybody really believes you clawed your way out of poverty. You're in a crewneck sweatshirt for Chrissakes.
Idiot!  What I said was, ‘You don’t have a CLUE!’
Hay babe, want to see crab hands?
Look who’s being crabby, Buster!
I know you're trying to get closer to my family,
But really George?
Shoving your claws up my great grandmother's ass!
You can grab the gusto without me, buddy!
I don't want to hold your hand because I'm mad at you not because of  your claws.
MAM I AM WEARING EAGLE BEAK GLOVES TO PROVE MY INTENT
A mani-pedi doesn't seem the best option for a first date.
Well, I for one, do not like the word 'Great'.

First day on Wall Street, sir?
Why yes, I always do dress to kill.
Now that’s what I call a dinner jacket.
I'll take this and the granny dress.
Perfect! I'm surprising someone for dinner.
This is more practical for work, but the Zebra is just so fun.
I don't know. Do you think it makes my teeth look big?
Dress for the meal you want, not the one you have.
It’s so ewe!
Would you like to try on a different metaphor?
It's from our new White House collection.
This should get me through the primaries.
Why bother?  The sheep will still vote for me even if I eat one on Fifth Avenue.
I want something that says, 'I'm approachable.'
Could you pull the wool over my eyes?
I love that it's 100% wool.
Our D.C. store can't keep these in stock.
Do my teeth look big in this?
It's a formal dinner. Do you have it in black?
Love it — perfect for a quick bite or an evening out.
Sometimes you just have to go with the classics.
It won't fool Grandma, but the Electorate...
You look absolutely ravenous.
Dressed to kill as usual I see.
Do you have it in black?
Is my intent showing?
And you're sure I'll blend in?
Of course it's not you,  but isn't that the point?
It's very ewe, Sir.
Sir, allow me to offer you an alternative to the cliche.
It's an off-the-rack of lamb.
This really isn’t me. I’ll take it.
I still can't believe this works every year.
On second thought, let me try the one with the orange face and the tiny hands again.
Don't bother with wrapping; I'm wearing it straight to work.
They say cliche- I say classic.
Are you sure it's not too cliche?
It bespeaks a conformist sensibility and intentional deception—I’ll take it.
Very presidential!
Don't dress for the meal you ate; dress for the meal you want to eat!
I can't decide between this and the grandma outfit.
THIS is you, sir, and barely recognizable.
An excellent choice sir.  It brings out the beast in you.
Did you also want an outfit for when you go huffing and puffing?
This one will be perfect for a little dinner I am planning
It's our new line for 2020.  It's already big in Washington.
I'm gonna need this one for the swing states.
Ah, you can never go wrong with a classic.
You're right, it does make me look more approachable.
Farm-fatale
Why, yes, it's for my confirmation hearing.  I'm frankly surprised you still had one in stock!
It makes me feel so...unimpeachable.
It's not cultural appropriation if it's couture.
And this is the same one he wore in 2016?
Sir, this is indeed our fleece de résistance.
I'll take this one if you throw in the grandma costume for half price.
Perfect. Even I’d eat me.
Absolutely dashing sir, but a tad dressy for huffing and puffing.
You have to be a real wolf to look that good in sheep.
I mean, I like it, but is it cultural appropriation?
Do you also have this in pig?
Oh I feel baa-d
I definitely prefer this to the nightgown and bonnet
I like it, but I want pockets. do you have anything in a marsupial.
Can I get it in black?
Very good, sir. And the billing address is still Grandmother’s House?
It’s to die for.
Let’s hurry this up, she’s already over the river and through the woods
I know it''s cliché, but I absolutely love it!
I was born lupine, but I identify as ovine.
Yes, they are all free-range.
This is the one Vladimir likes.
That is so ewe
They're all fabulous, but this one has me salivating.
This’ll work in the blue states, what’ve you got for the red?
Very good sir, you can't go wrong with the classic.
Oh, the bargains at Neiman Carcass!
Too obvious, let's try the Zebra again.
The best part is I can deduct it as a campaign expense.
I'd say this one looks more presidential.
I don't care if it makes me look fat, as long as it doesn't make me look hungry.
No, I need more of a power-suit. 
This makes me look like a follower.
Yes, I WILL kill in this outfit!
...and I’ll throw in the pigs’ address as they are potential Cloven Hoof donors.
I love it! No animals were harmed, right?
I'll take this one, and the american flag lapel pin to complete the package.
This is too obvious. Let me try the business suit.
I'll take three bags full.
Can I rent it?  I heard you do predatory lending.
Now I understand, sir. I brought out cheap clothing and you wanted ‘sheep’s’ clothing.
I don't usually wear white after Labor Day, but I'll make an exception.
I’m not looking to make a statement. I just want to blend in.
Not everyone can pull it off, but I am sure you will kill it!
This one is perfect for both of my New Year’s resolutions: gain weight and try to get more sheep.
Yes, but I'm wearing it ironically
You were right - I do look great in wool.
You know that's a poodle, right?
Would you eat me? I would eat me.
It’s actually polyester but you can hardly taste the difference.
This is very flattering to my sense of irony. I'll take it.
I suppose the choice would depend upon your objective, sir. Is it meant for a dinner engagement?
What good taste I have.
Sorry for the confusion, sir. I thought you asked for " the sheepest one."
I want something that says, 'I'm not here to eat you.'
This one really shows off what big eyes I got.
Now for the hard part... Baaaaaaa.
I love it. But don't you think it's a bit too cliché?
Alright, now pull the wool over my eyes."
Let’s try the pig. Somehow I don’t think they’ll fall for this.
What do you have in a Grandma?
It's not me...it's perfect
I agree, “a wolf in pig’s clothing” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
No one will believe it. Oh wait!  Donald Trump is President.
I think this one strikes the right balance of insouciance and menace.
I really thought I wanted a change, but sometimes you just have to stick with what's classic.
This one is perfect, do you also have it in black?
I'll take it! I think I'm going to enjoy life on the lamb.
I’m running for President, why do you ask.
Do you have a Trump one? Sheep love him!!!
...and you’re saying this is 100% wool?
This is the first time I've been fleeced and I'm loving it
You have to dress for the job you want, not the one you have, right?
Timeless.
YES! This will certainly do for my domestic work. I'll take the zebra and gazelle for my overseas trips.
See how it fits when you huff and puff.
Well, you can't beat a classic
Gimme the zebra--I look like a complete idiom in this one.
Indeed, the stripes were slimming, but this hides so much more.
I love it...does it come in black?
This one makes me look like Rudy Giuliani.
Perfect.  Mary won't know what hit her.
You had me at 'machine washable'.
It's between this and that red-hooded number you showed me earlier.
By the way, I love your human costume.
This will do for the primaries, but I need something less obvious for the convention.
This one is nice, but does it say cruelty free?
The wolf in sheep's clothing shtick is a bit overdone, but I can't see myself with stripes or udders.
And,of course,sir,this is 100% wool
It's my first time going to a vegan restaurant, so I want to make a good impression.
Would you like me to pull the wool over your eyes, Sir?
And, of course, it is genuine wool.
Perfect! Now I can go into politics!
Oh, yeah. I’d eat me.
Great for surprising the herd or addressing a nation.
Aha! The perfect fleecing outfit!
I'm not used to having the sheep on the outside...Nice!
Deceit never goes out of fashion.
Excellent choice, sir. Shall I put in on your Diners Club Card?
I look so good but feel so baaaad.
A bit too cliche!  Besides, I've got a party to attend in a brick house, so I'll take the pig.
Doesn’t make me look sheepish, does it?”
It’s perfect, sir. They’ll take you for a victim.
Oh, yeah. This is a killer outfit.
Ahh yes, that one is very popular in our D.C. store.
Will you be wearing hoofs?
Very fine choice Sir. Its a favorite among my most influential clients, including Politicians, Lawyers, Televangelists, and even some Doctors.
We have them in all sheeps and sizes.
I’ll kill in this one
And you say this is 100 percent wool?
It's for a dinner date.
Would you trust me? I'd trust me.
They're all so delicious; I just can't choose.
It's for a friend.
I do love a shear blouse.
Now you’re sure I won’t be accused of cultural appropriation?
And these furs are cruelty free, correct?
Timeless classic - or tired trope?
But does this make my teeth look big?
Fashions fade, style is eternal."
Try on the kangaroo. You'll like having pockets.
Who says you can't wear white after Labor Day!
Are you sure I don’t look like a complete idiom?
I like it. The only problem is it makes me look like a politician.
What do you think? I'm considering a run for office."
Mr. Trump Sir..

Which personality trait would you like to wear today? the pig, the lazy cow, the ass..I mean donkey
It sure beats dressing up like Grandma.
Excellent choice, its last owner is in the White House!
This suit will separate me from the pack.
At least it’s not the elephant in the room.
Not B-a-a-a-a-d!
Would you eat me? I’d eat me.
I'll take this one.  Wrap up the Bo Peep for my wife, too.
Simply ravishing...I will kill it in this outfit!!”
I'll take it! Just bill my campaign
Just add the monogram GOP and you've got a deal.
Forget Red Riding Hood, this can get me Bo Peep!
I like the new styles too, but I think I will go with a traditional look
Does this make my butt look fluffy?
Wool does give me a softer side.
And finally, this is the last outfit from our fabled Aesop collection.
Warm, and renewably sourced;  I’ll take it!
Wait until they don't see me in this.
This outfit will absolutely slay.
It looks great on you, Ivanka!
You have excellent taste.  This is the choice of our president's sons
I’m thinking of it more as a rebranding
No, no, I said like a wolf in 'chic' clothing.
Yes, sir. Your outfit hits the nail on the head, barks up the wrong tree, is a piece of cake, a pie in the sky and is, um, something else I can’t quite put a finger on...
That one really brings out your teeth.
If I haven't returned it by 5:00 AM you can assume it works.
Yes, a long red tie would work.
It becomes you, Donald
Oh screw it, I’m wearing white.
Who is afraid of the big bad wolf now, huh?
I just love your Ready-to-Eat Collection.
Were any animals harmed making this jacket?
Dress to repress.
Sir, New York is probably the only city in the world where YOU can go as your actual self.
It's how I've always felt on the inside.
Most excellent choice, sir. Shall I go ahead and charge it to the Senate account as a travel expenditure?
Sometimes you just have to stick with a classic.
That’s the one, sir. She’ll never know what bit her.
It's just not me. I'll take it!
Is it ethically sourced?"
I find that wool itches.  What do you have in alpaca?
I like it. It makes me feel b-a-a-a-a-d.
Lamb is the new pork.
Yes, this is the perfect dinner jacket.
Will it last me through the primary season?
An excellent choice, monsieur. Cliché has such cachet these days!
It's so not me - I'll take it!
Love it--it's so not me!
Do you have a lighter shade? I told her my fleece is white as snow.
But what if he wears wolf’s clothing?
All this shopping is making me hungry.
Ok, but will I be able to pull it over THEIR eyes?
Dress to kill, right?
Yes, this one has a certain innocence about it.
Pass me the Zebra, it's the horizontal stripes that make you thinner.
Sir, I believe you are supposed to wear it with the wool over your eyes
Yes!  Let's go with the cliche.
In like a wolf, out like a lamb, sir?
This one really brings out the gleam in your eyes and the sparkle in your teeth, I do say.
May I suggest something less predictable?
Sir, I would ask you to please take off the wolf suit before trying on another animal.
To die for? I should certainly hope so!
It’s between this, the pig, and the false prophet.
Should the gentleman wish to blend into Wall St., we offer a robust collection of pinstripes.
I just keep coming back to the sheep. It’s so versatile!
Classic! excellent choice, "let them know you're a pig" is so last election.
Oh yes, I prefer understated deception.
Yes, you are looking very big and quite bad indeed, sir.
I like it, but something a little less revealing, perhaps?
Have you any fake gnus?
With the right accessories it will be a killer look.
Love it. Do you take Diners' Club?
Grandma will absolutely die when she sees me in this.
That's the one, sir! I hardly recognize you!
I think the best part will be bragging that I share a tailor with the President.
It’s very sheep like, but that’s actually labradoodle
Perfect! Now do you have anything that says, "Grandma"
This is it! This suit shouts, "Trust me."
It's black tie so maybe something in a penguin?
Ooh! I look delicious in this one!
I know it's cliche, but there's just something about the timelessness of a classic.
And it's 100 percent wool?
Do you think this one makes me look sheepish?
très sheep!
You hardly need it in an election year, but it seems more sporting.
I'm loving my new look, but do you think others will consider this agricultural appropriation?
Perfect! Now I’ll finally blend in at work.
This fleece won't do, it's too proverbial.
Yes, it’s a classic but I’m moving to L.A. I’d like to see some vegan alternatives
Ironically, it was my vegan diet that got me into shape.
Ring this up with the granny outfit.
Do you think this one makes me look fat?
Would you like to try the Grandma suit next sir?
Too obvious?
I'd also like to see what you have in a grandmother.
Are these locally sourced?
This suits my taste perfectly.
Will blood stains come out?
I like this one, but I think I'd like to see the Grandmother costume one more time
Do you have anything more gullible?
Perfect for my weekend in the country.
Impeachment, imsheepment, this coverup will work fine!
Thank God the boys went hunting.
Ooh, I like it...but is it locally sourced?
I look fabulous. If I didn’t know better, I’d eat myself.
Does this metaphor make me look fat?
Yes Sir. Quite ironic, Sir.
Oddly,it's the only one that doesn't itch.
Do you have anything vegan?
I’d really like to show more of my vulnerable side.
This will be perfect for the next Presidential debate!
You don't need to wrap it. I'll wear it home.
I love the bovine look. But I can't resist the irony of this one.
Wise choice sir - the 2020 delegate special.
Oh, it's for a girl alright.
They say dress for the job you want not the job you have.
We do have a Grandma suit in the back that we save only for our most discriminating clientele.
If only the old pack could see me now!!
This one. They say to dress for the meal you want.
I guess that depends sir, do you see yourself as a flock member, or do you have more of a herd mentality?
Yes Sir; this is the latest style and very popular among university professors and members of congress!
Oh yeah. This is me. Soft but vicious.
On you sir it ceases to be a cliche
Which carcass was the most sustainably sourced?
Ravishing.  How appropriate.
This one is so conflicted. I love it.
High school reunion. I’m want something that’s says, “I’m not who you thought I was.”
Heck yes I identify as a sheep. Their bathrooms are so much better.
I say, it goes rakishly well with my sheepish grin.
The perfect dinner jacket
You wouldn’t be pulling the wool over my eyes, would you?
Yeah, yeah, it's a costume party...a surprise costume party.
You know, I've never identified as a wolf.
It's ewe all over.
I look delicious.
It’s such a cliche, but I’ll take it.
The stripes were slimming, but this hides all I need it to.
You're gonna KILL in that outfit
I don’t know, white after Labor Day?
I love it! But do you have it in black?
Now THIS kills!
Rest assured, all of our garments are grass fed, pasture raised and local.
Nothing slays 'em like a wool suit.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't realize you were Kosher. I'll take these two back.
And the best part is that it's not cruelty-free.
It's ewe.
Wall Street here I come
We also have a nice Puppy outfit which will get you in anywhere.
It’s so not me.
That piece is all the rage. We can hardly keep it in stock, particularly in our DC store!
Ah! A perfect portrayal of Lindsey Graham.
I think the sheepskin is best for blending in.
Sheep clothing is a little 2019.  Try one of  these.
I agree, sir: I'd choose "sheepish" over "cowed" any day.
I love the smell of sheepskin in the morning.
Perhaps you would like to try something Gnu
Well, at least it's not fur
Yes, It's definitely you. Well ,not actually you, but it is you.
Perfect. Can you recommend a good nocturnal animal for my evening wear?
Do you really think it shows off my sensitive side?
The wolf in sheep's clothing was a very popular costume, particularly in the Washington, D.C. area.
You’re so right – I do look dressed to kill!
Yes, we have faux 
for every occasion, Sir.
And if you want something even warmer I may have an alpaca in the back.
I hope that one is a bit more to your taste, Sir.
You don't think it's a little... cliché?
Does this sheep make my ass look fat?
Now, this is more to my taste!
A wolf in sheep's clothing!  This could start a trend.
Don't try to pull the wool over my eyes--I know a knock-off stole when I see one!
Tempting, but I think something less cliche.
The style may be a bit cliché, but it's me.
I don‘t know...Do you have anything sheeper?
I do think that one brings out the real ewe, sir.
What a bold suit choice senator.
Do you have anything in a vegetable?
Do you have something in synthetic?  Wool makes me itch...
I'm tired of dressing like a Senator.
Classics are always in style.
No, no. I think we've found it!
Am I too old to pull off lamb?
I assume this is cruelty free, of course.
It also comes in black, you say?
Is it 100% inhumane?
You can't put a price on the perfect cliche.
This is what I need to get into the Labradoodle Meetup.
My nutritionist told me you wear what you eat
Do you think this costume makes me look trustworthy?
We're going public you know. I need something to wear.
My friends would kill for one of these.
I'll go with this one - it'll look great with my new Uggs.
And she was fleeced humanely
I think this will meat my needs.
Don't bother wrapping it.
Yes, this is the cliche I've been searching for!
Charles, your instincts are killer.
Does it come in black?
Perfect! Do you have it in orange?
Finally, you get me!
I’ll wear it ironically.
A fine selection.  It is made of our finest wool, which we had three bags of.
You should really take the whole wardrobe. It gives you so much versatility for every dining occasion.
I think I like the Wolf in Sheep's clothing for my trip to Mar-a-lago.
If you’re interested in national politics, and want something for the whole pack, I’ll make you a great deal on 52 cowardly lions that we’re way overstocked on.
You say it's warm in the winter, cool in the summer, machine washable, and eco friendly?
I'll be needing this one through November 4th.
It has a certain fairytale look about it!
Can you have it ready by the next full moon?
I feel like a pretty little cloud.
I loved the alpaca, but I'll get more wear out of this one.
This makes me look like an idiom.
It’s perfect! Fierce. Deadly. Fluffy.
A bit conventional sir, may I suggest we up your game.
Yes, Mr. Donald, Mr. Vlad has one just like it.
May I say Sir has never looked more...approachable.
Oh yes, Sir, it does look baaaaaad on ewe.
Do these include the original owners?
This looks better. The one on the chair is udderly ridiculous.
You’re right! It does become me!
Screw PETA, I am so doing this.
This'll be great for D.C. in the fall!
Is this too revealing?
Are you saying "Yes!" to the fleece?
Voila!  A hint of softness layered over an air of robust cunning.__
That's nice but soo predictable. Here, try something fresh.
I think you will like this one sir, it is 100% wool.
Would black make me look thinner?
Perfect way to express my inner predator - I'll take it!
This is more believable with my MAGA hat…
Of course, sir. It will be ready for the presidential campaign.
That also comes in Grandmother.
Ohhh, I like what this one does for my lies.
We also have the latest Grandmother look that might interest you.
I've been needing something I can wear to dinner.
My daddy always told me to dress for the prey you want and not  for the prey you have.
Let me see the Wildebeest again; I don't want to seem cliche'
Does this look too tight when I huff and I puff?
The whole stigma not withstanding, sometimes its just nice to feel pretty.
Do you have something to disguise the hair on my chinny-chin-chin?
If you'd like a boa to go with that, I have the real thing.
It seems identity theft does pay off.
They’re all fabulous! Do you have anything in a Granny and matching bonnet?
My pronouns are Sheep/Sheer.
Does this make my teeth look big?
Take that, PETA.
This one makes me look deceptively good.
It’s a bit itchy—do you have it in cotton?
I have a feeling I will become a legend.
She will never suspect, sir.
Perfect! My base, which is mostly sheep, is gonna love it!
It's as if it was made for you.
Oh yeah, my job just got a lot easier.
We recommend it to all our politicians.
Of course I'm an ethical lawyer.
This one really sparks joy
Good choice, sir.  Brings out your inner carnivore.
That one is too easy, they will know you’re a wolf - but a pig? They will never suspect!
How about I huff and I puff and we take the sleeves in?
and since this is the last day we can sell fur, I can give you a great price
Let me try the zebra again.
Dress the way you want to be treated!
It's me!  And not me!
Ah yes, this one will do nicely.  I'm going to a gathering in the country, and I'd like to fit in.
It makes me feel so baad.
I trust this wool is from a humane source?
Do you have anything in Stable Genius Nationalist?
I'll wear it home!
Impeccable. Any sheep would be briefly glad to know you.
The pig, cow and zebra are all trending with the wolf pups but, trust me when I say, this will never go out of style."
It's ewe, sir.
Enjoy your holidays Mr. Musk.
I would absolutely trust you with my daughter, sir.
I think it could work at Republican rallies.
Yes, it most certainly softens your image, sir.
I'll take it!  It's perfect for my next dinner party.
I just don’t want Little Red to say, “My, what a big butt you have!”
May I suggest you add a red riding hood?
This is the last time I place a bet with those three little pigs.
This is killer!
Okay, it's between this one and the Grandma one.
Oh sir, what a big checkbook you have.
This will make the vegans crazy.
It;s much more effective if you wear the hoodie, sir.
Excellent choice, sir.  This being an election year, it’s already on backorder.
That sir, is a fine example of a wooly bully !
Admirable,Sir. Sheeplike but wolfish. Many in the Upper Chamber will follow suit.
its a little tight, do you have anything in Big Bad Wolf size?
Are you certain that they'll flock to me?
Does it make me look too sheepish?
See if he cries wolf this time
I feel sheepish saying it, but this looks great.
I’ll never have to release my tax returns in this!
Everything so far just makes me feel hungry.
The classics never go out of style.
Do you think it’s too traditional?
I feel like it makes my teeth look big.
Perfect for the televised debates!
You should see Melania in the Little Bo-Peep costume.
What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in breathability
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Yes sir, I do think this will help you get re-elected
Oh man, Geoffrey... this will kill down at the farm!
Who would suspect a wolf in cheap clothing?
Screw the cliche, I'll take it.
This will go great with a little red riding hood.
I know it's not me - that's the point
Before I go to the Trump rally, make me look less evil for the TV cameras.
This would be best, but I'm allergic to wool.
I was the first cross=dresser, you know.
After giving up on chasing roadrunners, Wile E. Coyote found a new calling.
With this outfit, I should be able to fleece them and pull the wool over their eyes most successfully.
Have you got anything an old grandma would wear?
I like the traditional look but what do you have that’s gnu?
Because you can't say wolf without saying wool.
It brings out the false prophet in you.
I want a look that says 'Hungry - for affection'.
This is perfect! I would eat me.
It's you, only nicer.
Yes, this is much nicer than the monkey suit I wore to the Oscars
I’m going out for a quick bite with a herbivore.
That’s from our Capitol Hill collection, sir.
You'll kill in this.
A lawyer in sheep's clothing, I'll take it!
Why, yes, I could see wearing this to dinner at the Kushners!
If we take it in at the waist it will draw the eye away from the big teeth you have.
It's timeless.
It's a loose fit but that's fine, I'm planning to quit my diet.
You can’t beat 100% wool?
Ah yes, the sheep's clothing is one of our most popular items.
Remind me to thank Bill Cosby for recommending you.
Wear that and I promise you’ll become a famous saying
Does it come in Merino?
I’m so torn between this one and the Granny outfit...
It’s ewe. It’s really ewe.
This one may be a bit cliche, sir.
Perfect!  Now let me see something from your Grandma Collection.
I’d prefer to surprise them by dressing as a border collie.
I LOVE it -- it's sooooo not me! Do you have hoofs to match?
Oh this is much better, the cow was offal.
Does this make me look hungry?
Would you like to see our selection of nightgowns and bonnets?
Does this outfit make my motives obvious?
This isn't real fur, is it?
The classic one suits you, but for a bit of fun - you might surprise folks with one of these.
We have three bags full if you prefer it in black .
Grrrr...  I look like a wolf in cheap clothing!
I slay.
Perfect! I need to be dressed to kill for an event at the barn tonight!
The better to fleece you with, my dear...
You don't think it makes my teeth look big?
Don’t you think that’s a little too obvious?
I love it! I haven’t felt this vulnerable since I first went on the endangered species list.
Close enough for my base.
I think this one fits with the new PR campaign...
See you next election!
Maestro, you've really outdone yourself with this Election Year collection.
Cliché? Ironic? Who cares, it will get the job done.
No, it's NOT a 'Come as you are" party.
It certainly makes you approachable.
A wolf in sheep’s clothing is a timeless classic. But a wolf in zebra. Well, that’s right on line.
Does this make me look like I'm telling the truth?
It’s just so me!
I'll take a dozen outfits.   And some BBQ sauce
You should have mentioned you were an attorney.
I'd kill for this one.
... and it’s 100% wool!
Cultural appropriation? I think not.
A good choice; we’ve sold a flock.
Perfect
Throw in the mint jelly and Woolite, and you have yourself  a sale!
I'll take this one for my inauguration.
This is the aphorism I was going for.
I’ll try the striped one this one makes me look fat.
New Store Grand Opening: The Hides You Seek
I'll take them all, my doctor says I need a more balanced diet.
A classic never goes out of style, does it, Geoffrey.
I'm not sure about Little Red Riding Hood, but I know Bo Peep will find you irresistible.
This is faux fur, right?
It's not really me, but it would make a terrific metaphor!
I don't know . . . Last year I went as a grandmother and felt like such a cliche."
If that one doesn’t work there are plenty of CAT costumes coming back
It doesn't feel very me,but I kind of love that about it.
So this is what they're wearing in D.C. these days?
Yes! I think this one could become legendary.
I look baaaaaaad!
...they said the theme of the party is going to be: 'You are what you eat'
Nice material!  The other salesman tried to pull the wool over my eyes.
And if the gentleman is a vegetarian, we have some lovely potato skins you may be interested in trying on.
You don't think this makes me look too cliche' ?
So, do you think it’s retro or
just cliché
Do you think this looks too cliche?
Yeah, the cow one was chique; but I'm really looking for irony with a touch of timeless metaphor."
Does this effectively cover up my intentions?
It brings out the hunger in my eyes.
Perhaps you'd like to try on something a little less cliché?
Can I see your selection of old rich white privileged men in power?
Might you have anything in red?
It's been popular in China, Iran, and Russia, but the North American has really warmed up to it.
Have you got something a bit more sheepish?
Perfect for the Beltway crowd
Yes.  YES!  Now, do you also have it in black?
Perfect, add it to the pile. Now, what do you have in 'grandma'?
Classics never go out of style.
Of course this is it. Whoever heard of a wolf in pigs’ clothing?
That's smart, but so last year.
Just what I need to get in the Republican primary.
If I may say so, sir, you look like a snack!
You can’t beat a classic!
I think it brings out the kindness in your eyes.
I'm gonna be baa-ed at Little Bo-Peep's costume party.
Somehow the grandma just felt more me.
I'll take this one and eat the cashier on my way out
I'll take them all.  It is not easy being a wolf in a fairy tale.
Yes, yes, I like it but isn't it a bit obvious?
Think I can get away with this after Labor Day?
Feels a bit cliché. Let me try the zebra again.
I love it, but it’s an election year
Yes sir, three bags full
Fine. Charge it to my Wall Street account.
May I show you something in a different appetite"
This is nice, but do you have anything in a grandma?
It's all the rage in Washington.
The classic look is never out of fashion.”
Excellent choice madam.  A classic.
Lamb off the rack suits me!
I'm looking for a disguise that screams, "Who cares? He's got the support of his base."
Oh yes. November 2020, here I come.
Who said role-playing can't be deliciously fun?
You can be more than just a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
You're right; this is more me.
This is perfect, but do you also have one in black?
Perhaps madam would like to see something in a stripe?
Forget the pigs and Little Red.  My third act will be to sheep, perhaps, to seem.
I hate shopping for clothes. I'm right between a medium sheep and a large sheep.
Do you have one in grandmother?
The zebra would be more slimming.
Trust me you won't be as desirable in the black.
It has ewe written all over it.
You don't think I look too sheepish, do you?
Sir, you look ravenous, I mean, ravishing in that suit.
Yes, I like this one.  Do you have it in cotton?
It may be a cliché but damn I look good!
Who looks yummy? I look yummy!
Oh, this irony is to die for!
Some say cliché, I say classic.
I still believe the wildebeest is more your look sir. Sheep is so last year.
But does it come in black?
Are you sure no one will recognize me in this?
Yes " I'm saying yes to the sheep" !
This is perfect, I'm hunting PETA members.
I like this one, it really brings out the color of my eyes.
I like how I can't pull the wool over my eyes.
Don't worry, this is a faux fur. Our company is committed to animal rights.
I applaud your ironic sense of style, sir.
I’ll take this one. It accentuates my eyes, ears, and teeth.
Someone’s grandma will be so pleased to see that you dressed for dinner!”
I don't know. Are you sure it's real wool?
This will do nicely. Will you take a third party check?
Dahling,that is sooo yesterday.
Could I try on the carrot costume instead? I've gone vegan.
Just don't get blood on it.
They're not just for breakfast anymore.
You're right:  This IS a killer outfit!
A bit pricey perhaps, but it's so ewe.
Sheep’s clothing is very “in” this year.
I'll take the Fable
Yes, I think this will make a perfect dinner jacket.
Now... if I can just pull the wool over my eyes...
You're really going to fleece me this time, aren't you?
Do you carry this same suit in shorn?
This will do nicely for the inauguration.
Yes, Ivanka, the blood suits you.  Would you like to try on another animal your brothers killed?
Oh sure I look great in it, but it's a bit too cliche'


David Shamer, Cherry Hill, NJ
You say the bovine look is in?
Excellent selection for every subpoena occasion, sir. 
In fact, last week a member of the White House staff bought out the remaining stock.
« Would the gentleman like to try a pair of matching Jimmy Moo’s ? »
This one’s to die for.
Is it shear enough?
I say "yes,  to the fleece!"
This sheep look isn't b-a-a-a-d.
Yes, this will do.  I won't need it after I'm elected.
It's the Don Trump Jr. collection? That explains the bazooka holes.
I just keep going back to this one- it’s a classic.
Yes! A drop dead outfit.
Is this one “approachable” enough for you sir?
This would  be great for the boardroom--or the bedroom.
Thrown in the pig and I’ll take it!
Pure wool.
It needs to be washable.
Thank you Nigel, no one will suspect a wolf in sheep’s clothing
I'm looking for something that doesn't stand out in a crowd."
It definitely softens that big and bad image
Who's this designer? I never heard of Matthew 7:15.
I should run for office.
If you buy that, I'll throw in a Grandma costume for 50% off.
Slow-food will always be better than fast-fashion.
Do you have anything in a faux fur?
May I ask where all the meat from these animals went?
Yes, wolf in sheep's clothing is a classic, never goes out of style.
Never let it be said – this look doesn't kill!
Shall I wrap it up, or will you be wearing it out?
As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.
Don't wear white after Labor Day, hah! They'll never see me coming!
Yes, yes... You do know my taste, James.
One minor question:Does blood wash out of wool?
If sheep’s clothing doesn’t appeal, there are other options.
It's the perfect disguise for you to fleece all the others.
How much more with the "I really don't care do you?" printed?
Buying an outfit for your impeachment trial?
Throw in a crown rib roast and six center-cut pork chops and I’ll take it!
Would you like to try a different look for the new year?
I don't know...it looks a little Cliche
Trust me, you’ll be able to pull the wool over anyones eyes with this disguise
And if I might say so, sir:  you look ravening!
Of course it all depends on what you're preying for.
Yes, sir, all of our clothing is ethically and sustainably sourced.
Too predictable; what else have you got?
It might be even better with the 
wool pulled over your eyes, sir.
Ooh, this one is to die for!
Excellent choice, your highness. Will you be wearing it to Mr.Epstein’s party or shall I wrap it?
Baalenciaga?
I don't recommend white after Labor Day.
I see you are still most comfortable in sheep’s clothing
Its classic!
I'll win the ugly sweater contest,for sure!
Does this make me look sheepish?
...in fact, I'd rather nobody notice I'm wearing it at all
It’s reversible, a wolf in sheep’s clothing or a sheep in wolf’s clothing.
It's big, it's bad, and it positively CRIES wolf!
I'll take it. The friends I'm having for dinner will love it!
Love it! They'll fold like a sheep suit.
Not too conservative?
This one makes me look fat, but what a diet waits for me !
I know, I'm predictable and unimaginative. Life is good.
Could work...the Wall Street guys did ask me to try to fit in!
Dress for the meal you want.
And you think it’s not too obvious?
Oh how I love to shop for hunting clothes
Is this one too on the nose?
Forget the others--I want this one by Aesop of Greece.
Ewe wear it well sir.
It goes in cycles, and it's back to the classics!
Perhaps it's just that you're not comfortable in your own skin.
As long as it's NOT cruelty free i'm fine with it
Perhaps sir would prefer a slightly less obvious guise?
This will  really help me blend in
This might be a bit too predictable.
Something less traditional perhaps
Rumor has it, one must blend in.
Honestly, do you think this sheep's clothing makes me look trustworthy?
Yes! Yes, you are right. This IS the best coat for re-election!
A cliche is a cliche because it's universally applicable.  I'd go with it.
Yessssss... very presidential. I love it.
Organic leather new with tags, worn only once, grass-fed. Impressive. This is truly sustainable, cruelty-free fashion. I just beg one more question from you, sir: is it vintage?
It may please you to know that the one you are considering was intentionally hit on Safari by a  Range Rover driven by one of the Trump boys.
You're right, Pierre. I should dress for the dinner I want.
Perfect fit! Tell Cosby I will dry clean it for him as well.
Is it too cliché?
..And will you be paying for this with your tax break
Excellent choice, sir. Now, are you running as a democrat or republican?
You're sure this is not culturally insensitive?
I'm interested in that come hither look.
Blind date. Her friend said she loves men in uniform.
Definitely! My grandma outfit is so last year.
Oh, this one is just delicious.
A classic. Fine choice, sir.
You don’t wear it, it wears you.
Yeah...That's the ticket!  Now, can I see it in black?
It looks fine on you, but I think it's too much of a cliché.  How about the pig? No one has ever heard of a wolf in pig's clothing.
I look innocent, but does it make my butt look big?
Indeed!!  It is a "ravishing" look!!
You know I'm a celebrity; in which one will I able to grab the ladies' pussies most  successfully?
Do you have something less ewey and more ramy?
Do you have anything in a vegan option?
Let me try Grandma again?
And what is your return policy?
That sir is totally ewe.
I like it, but this time I’m going for more of a Grandma vibe.
This is perfect, I’ll wear this for the debates...
It’s really transforms me, don’t you think?  I’ll take this one and the other one in black”
I love the irony.
It's classic for a reason
This won't fool anyone. My head is exposed.
Ironically, I DON'T want to stand out from the flock.
Free-range? I'll take it.
The strategist said this suit will help get me through my Senate confirmation hearing.
I'm trying to up my game. Do you have anything in a shepherd?
And where would you like the dead grandmother placed?
Call me old fashioned, but I just have to go with tradition!
What would you wear if you trying to blow down a house?
I can't believe it took this long to decide.
Perfect for tonight's dinner.
Perfect. I'll wear it out to dinner.
My wife is really going to enjoy this roleplay
Yeah, definitely shows my soft side.
This should stop them from crying Wolf!
This is way better than the leopard print.
I wish I was more comfortable in my own skin.
Do you also have some human skin? I think I want to run for office.
I love stores that cater to the 1%.
I’m trying to spice up our sex life so I’ll take them all.
Dinner's on me.
I don't know..are you sure it's Granny Cottage appropriate?
Now THIS is smart casual!
This one just feels right
Does this one make my teeth look small?
Impeccable selection of campaign outfit, sir. Might I also suggest our Gentleman's Guide to Political Posturing and High-Minded Rhetoric. It's every bit as reassuring and toothless as your attire.
Perhaps, you would prefer something a little less traditional.
This will get you a lot of new followers, Mr. Wolf!
Yes, it’s totally not me!
This played in New Hampshire, now onto Iowa and let's win one there."
And the fact that it's faux means I can hunt in Brooklyn!
I like it.  It's more subtle than the others.  I feel like I won't stand out.
Now this just howls big and bad yet approachable.
I’ll take it.  How about something in a medium grandmother?
I know I shouldn't wear fur, but this one is the real me!
This works!
I know you're not supposed to wear white after Labor Day but I'll take it.
One normally doesn't wear mutton after Labor Day, but you may just pull it off.
Our finest merino, sir. Excellent choice.
Excellent choice, Mr. Osteen.
Do you have this in free range?
It's bah-spoke.
So, I don't dry clean it.  I'll just use Woolite?
You know what? I just keep coming back to this classic.
Does it come in anything besides wool?
I would choose this one, but those farm boys are pretty fast.
The eland made my butt look fat. This is much better.
Does it come with Scotchguard?
We make a false profit on that one.
Can it be ordered in black
Can I get it without bleats ?
Do you have it in black, Weil?
And then one in black for the evenings downtown.
I've always appreciated your predatory lending rates.
This is it! I look so ravishing I could bite myself.
This would be the one for the traditionalist in you.
If it pleases you, would you like to try on the hooves.
Now I just need an American flag lapel.
My vegan friends will eat me alive.
If I wear this, the shepherd will get the count wrong and never fall asleep.
I like it, but does it make my ass look big?
Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they serve you lamb for dinner.
Ah yes, it's YOU, Sir
This is my favorite line of pastoral attire.
Like yourself, I can assure you, this garment is 100% vegan.
Oh yes! this one is to die for!
It's shear magic!
Actually, all I need is a MAGA cap.
A sure winner to beat out the other presidential candidates!
Sold
Yes, it's me!
To be quite honest Pierce, and keep this between us, sometimes I just long for a predator. Something in a tiger-stripe perhaps
I'll take this one and a pint of your mint jelly!
It’s perfect. Do you do lay-in-wait payments?
I like it even better than your grandmother outfit.
Yes, it’s stunning, but they have learned.  So, let’s be creative.
Perfect! Now let's go get their votes.
Shear elegance..."
May I suggest these might be less obvious.
I think I'd like something a little less metaphoric.
I love it -- it baa's of plausible deniability!
Glutton dressed as lamb...I like it.
Yeah, I love it, but is wearing white after Labor Day doable?
These animal options are nice, but do you have something to make me look like a little girl's grandmother?
Awesome. And you say PETA’s okay with this?
I can’t decide between beef or lamb.
The real Wolf of Wall Street
A truly unnatural selection . . . . .
A classic never goes out of style!
I'm just not sure this outfit screams ME, you know? ...I'll take it.
I’m saying “Yes to the dress”!!
I think this really brings out my eyes. What do you think?
You're sure this is acrylic? My wool allergy is fierce.
Oh that's the one Mr president
I feel so different. And I'm not ashamed to say... I like it!
Aesop-lutely fable-ous!
I like them all, but this one is simply fable-ous.
Can I get it in merino?
Why yes, that SCREAMS transparency.
It's for a party celebrating an IPO on the Street.
You’re sure it’s not too cliché?
This is from my ‘Cliche Couture’ collection.
This one really accentuates what big teeth I have.
Yes, I can believe these are all faux fur. But are they biodegradable?
It's going to be a "SURPRISE "  party.
Do you have this in some fake fur to please those on the upper east side?
For my Tinder profile!
Did I tell you I'm just buying this for Halloween"
This one is perfect, l will take two just in case one gets messy.
I love the Peta and the wolf motif.
Kiss ‘Grandmother’ goodbye, Charles. You’ve really outdone yourself this time.
I'm gonna kill in this one.”
Bbbbbbbbad to the bone!
Always go with the classics, I say
Difficult to say, sir, but the grandmother one did bring out your eyes."
This is perfect for Davos!
My, what a small waist you have!
You're sure it doesn't make me look too muttony?
Would sir like to try our lanolin cologne? Just the thing for a gentleman on the prowl.
Do you have something a little more slimming?
Wooly, or won't he? Tee hee!
I think we have a winner!
New year, new me.
Say "yes" to the dress?
Perfect! Just the thing for a dinner party!
Of course we can bill you, Senator. Home address? Or mail to the Capitol?
This new slim fit really brings out your teeth, sir.
This one doesn't look endangered enough.
Congratulations, sir. You're trending on Pornhub.
It's ewe.  It's positively ewe!
Does it make me look baaad?
Could I get this with a Putin mask....better yet, how about Trump?
Oh, that's just SO ewe!
You can never go wrong with a classic look!
Shortening the cuffs DID make a difference!
It may be cliché, but I really like the look.
I think I'll stick with the classic look.
May I interest you in the cow? They're buy one get one 'calf' off.
This one really makes my mouth water.
No one will hear Peter crying this time!
I love it, but does it make me look like mutton dressed as lamb?
There’s just something about this Merino wool that keeps me coming back.
Yes, sir. I do find this outfit most fitting for your line of work.
This is for work, you know.
I need something that both encapsulates my success in this last decade, and signals my strategy for the ‘20s.
I preferred the cashmere, but this gives me an idea.
Ah, just what I need to pull the wool over their eyes!
I'm running for President
You are so right! This one is most suited to my taste!
I told you, "in goat's clothing" doesn't have the same ring to it.
They’re all good Jeeves, but I think I’ll stick with tradition.
That one suits you perfectly, Mr. President.
I especially love the give in the waist.
Mr. Trump, the "wolf in sheep's clothing" is just the type of honesty the crowd loves from you.
Sir,  might I suggest something a little more provocative?
I’ll take a pack.
It’s been done.”
Marvelous! Just send the bill to Aesop.
This one doesn't need a caption
Oh, definitely, sir. Lamb is always trendy. This will get you into all the five-star restaurants.
I think this will work despite the saying. Do you offer a cross-species discount?
Is this imitation?
It’s organic.
I’m seeing the flock tonight - this will slay them.
I hope it’s faux… I decided to turn vegan in 2020.
I recently dressed the emperor, trust me - you’ll be famous.
Mr. Weinstein, that’s so you!
Mr Wolf, I thought you’d like something outside your usual. They say  stripes will be the new polka dot.
Now I can fleece the flock.
I know I shouldn't, but my instinct says this is the one.
Do I have your solemn word that even my most sheepish admirers will fanatically flock to me?
Works equally well for a night on the town or an afternoon snack.
It really suits you, Mr. President.
It's all the rage in Washington this year, sir.
Do you have anything in chicken?
Do you think it's too cliché?
What's your... return policy?
Perfect for those times you just gotta be ewe.
I eat meat, but I don't wear fur.
2020 is the year I lean in on being carnivorous.
I do like the classics.
You look good in these carcasses.
Apparel can be deceiving.
Yes, yes, sir.  But for an impeachment trial, I really must suggest something other than your daily wear.
I've done well dressed in white but the gals seem to be really curious about this "once you go black" rumor.
This one is a more traditional look.
Ewe got yourself a sale!
They said to come dressed as your favorite cliché
Is this your only lamb off the rack?
It’s from last year’s collection but still a classic!
Yes, this doesn't look half-baaaaad.
No, not after Labor Day.
All the Senators are wearing it this season.
I enjoyed the trend where we didn't even have to try to hide, but I'm thinkin' this is gonna make a comeback.
Ewe! It's perfect.
Adorable! Makes me want a little nibble of grass.
I dress for success and chase my dreams.
Republican Party Animal
For this price, I could just buy the sheep.
The Wolf of Woolstreet
... as granny’d say: It’s not the suit, it’s how you wear it.
I prefer red, with a hood.
Nope.  Too metaphorical.
THIS ought to create a sensation in the boudoir!
It’s a European 12, so a US 8– practically a 6. A large size 4.
I just keep coming back to the sheep's wool.   It just feels...right.
Do you think I look too much like a wolf in sheep's clothing?
I think monsieur has found his look.
Exactly what I wanted for my next presidential debate.
I love it. How easily do red wine stains come off?
Sheep is so cliche. Let’s try zebra.
The sheep's too small, the zebra makes me look fat, and the pig's....well, it's a pig.
I like it, but it seems so retro.
Would you fuck me? I'd fuck me.
Genuine merino really sells it!
a little on the nose don't you think sir?
I like it. But truthfully, I feel a little vulnerable with it on.
I’m sorry we just sold our very last grandmother costume.
This will be great for my date tonight!
It fits perfectly sir, and is so ewe.
This is making me hungry.
You don't think it's a little too spot-on?
Sir, with our selection, you'll always be dressed to kill.
Ah, perfect! Now, do you also carry human? Female, mid- to late-eighties, perhaps?
Do you have anything from last mating season?
Do you have anything in Granny, Extra Large?
You're right, Antoine, the wool will absorb the blood so much better!
The fit is perfect but it’s perhaps a bit too idiomatic.
Do you have something a little more wolfish?
Now, so long as Trump hasn't also chosen this one, I'm golden!
This is nice, but could I try the pig or ass costume?  I’m going for a more presidential vibe.
Can I get this with a red tie?
I know sir, but you can wear that one to ‘either’ party function.
I know it is cliché, but I love it.
It's the proverbial perfect fit!
I love it, but it's a little Cliché.
You can buy them all and change depending upon the target group.
Do I look presidential?
Now grandma will never know it’s me!
This isn't too formal, so I should fit in nicely with that crowd.
Do you think I look more like a sheep or a poodle?
Does this fur make me look fat?
Be honest Alberto, classic or cliché?
Do you have L size for dinner?
I don't know, can I try something from the Big and Bad Collection?
To be honest, I'd never considered poodle...
Shopping makes me hungry, do you have any suits like you're wearing?
No, no masquerade ball.  Dinner with the President at Mar-a-Lago.
Funny coincidence...we've just had an order for 150 four foot high gun-toting farmer costumes.
I believe that one suits you best.
Wipe that sheepish grin off your face.
it's not me, it's ewe
Sheep is so passé may I suggest zebra.
Let's see Billy Porter try to outdo THIS.
Marvelous choice, sir. If you’re not fully satisfied, perhaps you’d like to see something from our Fine Swine collection?
That's from our 'cliche'' line
You're going to like the way you look I guarantee it!
Shall we try another food group?
This will get by Secret Service.
I'll take all - yes ALL of this Paul Manafort collection."
It was our best seller in the last election cycle.
I’m famished!
Or the very popular lipstick on a pig.
For perfect camouflage I propose a Unicorn
Yep, that’s what she Said. Space.
I’ve always known I was a sheep trapped in a wolf’s clothing.
Wolfoodles are all the rage this season.
I love the feel...do you have one with a hoodie ?
I’ll take it, but can you put the entrails in a separate gift box?
You may be right Jeeves, I don't have that savoir faire in cow's clothing."
Free jar of mint jelly with this one, you say?
Yeah, this will do the trick.
But will it shrink?
I can see sir you will make a fine politician.
I will take this fabulous metaphor.
Of course I look fabulous. But what about fabled?
I hear grass fed will be the rage this year.
If Madame Lupine wishes something more exclusive, we have a few lovely options in unicorn.
I always wondered what I'd  look like dressed in sheep's clothing.
With that smile you could wear anything!
I knew the lamb would  be exquisite on you!
Malcom, you're a genius! This is perfect for my next trip to Kiev!
OK, Be an animal!!
Let me try that grandma outfit again.
I like how this shows off my feminine side."
This one is fableous.
This look slays.
This is it! Hey - you are what you eat.
This will be perfect for my trip to New Zealand.
Senator, it brings out the “I’m impartial” in you.
A bit cliché but it works.
Oooh, the irony on this one is just right.
Kind of itchy. Do you have one that's not made from wool?
Do you have anything with a red riding hood?
It's 100% vegan, right?
Do you have anything in rural Republican?
This will really upset Mary.
Yes....the Wolf of Wall Sheep....very good, Sir
Peeerfect! And do you have black hooves in a size 10?
Tonight, I'm going as the sheep of Wall Street.
Now to show those kids a real good library storytime!
I don’t know ... don't you think it’s too cliché?
It's killer!
It’s one of our best sellers; also available in black.
I love it! But does it come in black?
Hello my Dear!  I am here to make Grandma's house great again!
Cloven or UnCloven?
Do you have anything slightly more revealing?
It's so cliche.
Cliches be damned--wrap it up!
This is so me!
Do you have something that whispers 'plausible deniability'?
I make a heck of a lot more money than I did as a taxidermist
Yes!  This is a look that can become legendary.
So, are you saying, “Yes...”?
You're gonna knock them dead.
I'm looking for something a little more couture.
If only I wasn't allergic to wool.
I like it, but I think I'll go with something less cliche.
Me too!
I find that particular aphorism genealogically discriminatory.”
Is it a classic, or is it cliche?
Now when I say for exemple that it was a perfect call, I even believe myself.
It just isn't you!
If looks could kill ...
I keep telling you, it doesn't matter how I dress, I still feel like a fraud.
We have that with red highlights, if you prefer.
Much better.  They'll never fleece me again.
Wool, does it shrink if it gets wet?
I'll take it.  Not only is it warm but it serves a real need I have.
I like it, but wool shrinks.
Oh my,  I'm salivating.  I'll take it.
I need to wear something that no one will ask what my pronouns are.
Perhaps a second one in black for night time forays.
Won't the folks at PETA be surprised !
You'll be the belle of the barn, sir.
My wife wants me to be more trendy, but this look is timeless."
100% Australian Merino, sir. Strictly cold hand wash only.
The wolf in sheep’s clothing - now that’s a classic look!
It's the perfect outfit for marauding, but it is dry-clean only.
It really makes my teeth pop.
I like it!  But do you have something in sharkskin? I want to cover all my bases.
You'll ravage the party in that one sir!
Does this one make me look hungry?
If this doesn't fool them nothing will.
It's totally ewe.
Yes, to the dress!
This is one baaaad outfit!
This outfit captures the idiom better than those!"
The black sheep's clothing is more traditional, but the white is more slimming.
This will be perfect for my interview at the White House next week.
I look like a sheep, but I feel like a shark!
Excellent choice, sir.  My grandmother bought one just last week.
Now, what do you have for Casual Fridays?
I don’t know... Does this make me look desperate?
Are you saying  ‘yes’ to the sheep?
Can you have it ready in time for the Met Gala?
Yes, hide and sheep.
They'll never see you coming sir.
Excellent choice, sir.  It gets our highest “yelp” rating.
there's no background check for this, right?
Eat it up, Met Gala.
Of course we can get it to fit.  Our tailor is a border collie.
This is just what I need to move past that Red Riding Hood controversy
I really don't want to look like another member of the flock
The perfect outfit for playing the field
I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into my designs.
Oh yeah! It’s me, alright.
Does it make me look gay?... Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Actually, I prefer the cow costume. I've never been a trend-setter.
Mr. Wolf, you look so Baaaad!
It’s an oldie but wish you success.
Sir, you're definitely not a wolf in cheap clothing.
It's wonderful, Marcel... and I thought last year's grandma outfit was good!
Magnificent fit sir! It is our finest ungulate.
Yes Mr. Blitzer, that should get you into the Elephant's party.
Shabby sheep, you say?
Dressing up like grandma is SO last season.
I love your new spring line.
May I suggest the zebra as a more non-traditional look.
It’s after Labor Day, but white really is my color.
Now you won’t need to huff and puff.
I must say Ms Wolfe, you look a baaad lass in that coat"
I'd kill to wear something like this at a ball next year.
Fabulous, darling. I could just eat myself.
Do you also have something more old fashioned? Something your grandma would wear.
I'm ready for wall street.
Nah, I look more presidential without it.
You really are what you eat, sir.
Hand wash only?
NOW, I can impeach the shepherd.
If the ewe fits...
Too on-brand?
May I offer you something a little less on-the-nose?
It’s not very ME - I’ll take it.”
I'll take this one, the pig, and
the granny one you showed me earlier.
Don't you think this one is a little more slimming than the grandmother costume?
And the little tag says 'Satire'. Nice!
And you're sure this material is pesticide-free?
And which convention are you attending?
Do you have this in cotton? I'm allergic to wool.
Mutton skin is far too classical for you, wolf. May I suggest zebra ?
100% grass-fed
It's perfect Marty, I love Gyro's!!
And you’re sure it’s not “mutton dressed as lamb”?
Bespoke or off the rack?
A wolf in sheeps clothing.how intriguing and quaint!
Perfect attire for your re-election campaign!"
He-lloo, Dolly!
This oughta work.
The classics are always in fashion. But do you have free-grazing attire? Animal welfare is so important these days.
Ahh, a perennial best seller.
Perhaps I could interest you in something a little less...
cliche?
I like the opportunity's it suggests.
Do you have this in cotton or polyester?
Well if you’re sure you don’t have a turducken.
New Year's Resolution 1: Become a whole new me!
New Year's Resolution 2: Only eat fresh organic meats.
Sir, the sheep’s clothing is a classic. Have you tried on our pig or ass? They’re all the rage.
If I do say so myself sir, you really put the You in Menu.
Can I get this in cute and innocent ?
Very good, sir, it has that grandmotherly look that's just perfect.
It is a cliche, but it suits you.
You wouldn't have guessed it, but Little Red and her grandmother were loaded.
From one wolf to another, I like your costume better.
Come on, a wolf in sheep's clothing? It's old. Give these a try.
Listen, the carnivore diet is carb-free
That piece you have on is fresh from this year’s endangered collection!
Can you tell me if this is organic wool?
Yeah, but is it pure wool?
This will do nicely Jeeves. Now, tell the others I am ready for my campaign speech.
To grandmother's house I go!
That one is so ewe!
The potatoes are this way, Mr. Damon.
wait till Dolly sees this!
Could I try something in Canada goose?
But do you think it makes me look fat?
Do you have this one in a medium?
They’re all wearing it down on Wall Street
Do you have anything with a red hood?
Shopping for the perfect hunting jacket.
Yessss! They'll flock to me in this baby!
How about, You Be You?
Now all you have to do is try on that grandma outfit.
It looks better on you than Donald.
Excellent choice! Your admirers will flock to you and die for it!
I am so baaaad.
Any of them would suit you,but that one is definitely ewe.
I see your tastes have broadened
The ladies may find it a little too obvious. Alternatively,Sir may wish to consider a cuddly porker or something in stripes
I normally feel comfortable in my own skin, but tonigh
Be a lamb and find me something off the RACK !
Don't I just look good enough to eat?
Now that's a killer look.
Does this sheepskin make me look fat?
Now those stupid sheep will have to let me into their bridge league.
I just really want to impress her folks.
While stunning, Sir, it is still a cliche. We have new selections from the Donald Trump, Jr. Collection for your consideration.
Accusations of 'species appropriation' don't bother me. I'll stick with what works.
Sir, you don't look sheepish at all.
We believe in dressing for the job you would like to have!
This will make the ladies huff and puff.
No question about it, Sir; this one definitely suits you best.
Ohh Sweetie... livestock is sooo 2019.
Brilliant!  They will never see this coming!
May I suggest a necktie that would complete the look?
And you'll be pleased to know that no animals were harmed in the manufacture of these items.
This looks perfectly ravishing for the Shepherd's Dinner Party.  I'll take it."
I'll take this one - it just feels right....
With our Serengeti collection you will be making a statement about inclusivity when preying at a urban and diverse holiday party.
The ark was full of these guys.
Ooh la, la, this is tres sheep!
Wow, Merino is such a wonderful designer!
It’s really me!
"That one will live on through the ages - Mrs. Wolfe
You look ovine in that.
iGRUSS GOTT"  4
All the best for the SpaceX demo Mr.Musk!
It's definitely ewe.
A wolf in sheep's clothing?  Who would have imagined that?
A wolf in sheep's clothing? Nah, been there, done that.
Anything more matronly, like a grandmother would wear?
Everyone would recognise me in that one
You are what you wear.
Do you have something in "Endangered"?
Ah, merino: such a classic look!
Michael, you’re a genius! Who would have ever thought?
The invitation said to come as your favorite cliche. I just hope the rest of the pack didn't have the same idea.
I'll take this one!  No one will know who's in it!
I'll take this one.  But now you know too much.
I think if Sir truly wants to knock them dead, you might try pulling the wool over your eyes.
LOVE it! And you say it's organic, and free-range? Perfect!
It's a bit cliche, but I love it!
This is perfect! I'm a high-dollar Trump supporter, you know.
I'm a slave to modern fashion, but you can't go wrong wearing a classic look.
What pig size you have?
Say hello to the new ewe !
Not a Baa'd look, Sir...
I take it by that sheepish grin that you love it.
Sheep Herding Gala this weekend
Fine wool is never clichéd.
The alt-right’s way of pulling the wool over their eyes.
I'll take it for Mardi Gras!!
I know it looks real. I just worry they'll see right through the poly blend. Do you have anything that's 100% cotton?
Sir, I believe this is just the look you are going for...
I know you have a lot of Twitter followers, but you can’t change how the story is going to end.
You'll never go wrong with a classic, sir.
Only the finest for a presidential candidate.
This, and that little, "unifying centrist" number.
Excellent! Just in time for the primaries.
I’m Baa-ad!
For some reason that wolf just looks a little bit too real
Just think of how pleased your friends will be when you tell them that you're  wearing a 100% animal-free Vegan product.
They're all the rage these days.
Deja vu Gaston! Deja vu!
It’s all the rage this 2020 campaign season.
Timeless! I’ll take it.
The wolves of Wool Street
This should get you that position in the government, sir.”
You're right ... this is SO me!
But, Sir; sheep’s clothing is so cliche.
Not bah-bah-baaad!
This costume is for the books.
For once I won't mind showing up in the same outfit.
It is truly a captivating look, sir.
I’m embracing my Schizophrenia.
It fits perfect, a little sheepish but I’ll take it!
This one feels right. I know it.
Its just begging to be bedazzled
Perfect, even sheep will think you're a sheep.
What big teeth I have!
Bring me something new. 
This is  passé’ and hangs like roadkill.
Yes, it looks as good as it tasted.
That lamb “kept his silence”, this little piggy went “to market”, and our cow jumped “over the moon!”
The leather is nice, but I think I'll go with the wool.
It’s you sir.  You can grab them anywhere you like!
Might I say, “classic” suits you!
Save the zebra for a lion.  This is me!
This one is gonna cost someone an arm and a leg.
These are great, but for the big jobs I need a gray suit with a red tie.
I like the cliche but do you think it would make me look fat?
They're going to love this at the impeachment trial.
Ewe completes me.
It's nice but today I would prefer pork.
My, what big prices you have.” “Better to sell you, my dear...sir.
Oh it's definitely you!
I recommend dressing for the occasion, sir.
Henceforth, my drag name will be Dolly.
Perfect! No need to wrap it, I have to get over to Grandmother's house.
An itchy nose is only one of the problems.
It's perfect!  Let me take you out to dinner as a show of my appreciation.
So this one used to be Mary’s?”
I agree, it DOES suit me.
My parents always say, "Wolves don't care that sheep are vegetarian."
Yes, that one.  It is so not you.
Wool makes me itchy
May  I interest you in something with stripes?
cliches are cliches precisely because they do work, sir.
Do you have this in cashmere?
I just think it’s a bit fluffy for a hen-house, that all.
It's part of our 'buy one, get ewe' free sale.
This suits my line of work
I agree sir. A wolf in sheep's clothing has a certain cachet.
Everyone says to go for the sheep, but I am LOVING this Labradoodle.
I like it, but do you have anything that's a little less me?
Excellent choice, sir. The classics never go out of style.
We finally found the perfect dress suit! This one really fits your personality
Yes madam, the perfect look for 2020:  100% false-prophet-for-personal-profit wool.
This'll have to do. I'm late for my audition with Mr. Grimm.
You'd pick up anyone in a coat like that.
I love it. I'm just concerned about the PETA protesters.
And after you've finished with Red Riding Hood, you can give it a go with Mary!
It really brings out my Little Bo Peepers.
Oh, you're right! I look at myself  in this and think, ' That's so ewe!'
Never mind the hummus, where are the lamb kabobs?
Mmmm . . . I'll try on the pig again, but I think this is the one.
So sweet, so soft, so not me.
Will this shrink in the wash?
Walking in the club like excuse me sir
I am not a speciesist, but you can’t go wrong with a little white number.
They say down is warmer but it's just so hard to find a goose that's large enough.
Is it too...literal?
Does this make me look deliciously guilty?
Classic!
Do you have some mint sauce to go with it?
You should consider varying your diet, Sir.
Sheep’s clothing is so yesterday darling
does this make my butt look big.
Very sharp, but I was thinking of something with a hood, maybe in red.
Fabulous! Just the thing for my tour of New Zealand!
This one smells a bit hackneyed.
We're getting closer, I'm just looking for something that screams "Grandma".
The invitation said "no real fur"
That is just so "you."
I like it, but do you think it makes me look too proverbial?
Wool is so last season.
It's for my nephew's Baa-Mitzvah
It's just so much fluff.
I was hoping for something a little more grandmotherly.
I dunno . . . does it look like there's a wolf's head coming out of my mouth?
Traditional, AND you can wear it after Labor Day.
Perfectly b-a-a-a-a-a-ad! I'll take it!
Subtle idioms have never been my forte, I’ll take this one!
You are right! Why wearing the sheep's clothing when I can wear the sheep
I love the fit, but I need to know if it’s bloodstain-resistant.
May I suggest, Monsieur, that stripes make one look thinner?
Warmth, or the slimming Zebra pinstripes? What is a wolf to do
Do you have a Baby Yoda?
Herrree's Wolfie!
I'm not sure. I'm seeing Baaaaa but I'm feeling Argggggh!
Say "aye" to the hide.
Our top seller, and it comes with a certificate of authenticity.
I don’t know—feels a little trite.
God Damn, I look fucking fabulous in this shit.
I predict that the three little pigs and Red Riding Hood will lose in 2020!
Oh,my! It's me.
What do you think — too cliché?
This one will fool Cngress!
Ravishing !
Good.  I need my butt to look big.
That suit is very popular with investment bankers at your firm who fleece the public and the hog and bull suits are great for casual Fridays.
So, are you ready to say, “Aye to the hide?”
Makes no difference , I'll still be a wolf and you''ll still be an attorney.
Oh! I think we've found THE one.
We all agree Mr President - it was a perfect call
Does it come with a Bible?
Sir, You were born to wear that!
Am I nuts or did the color look different online?
And will you be paying for this with your tax break, Senator Warren?
PETA protest, i guess?
It's how you dress on your days off that are the most intriguing.
And you’re sure this has an expandable waist?
How will this go with the red hood?
I can't wait to Tweet about this!
That sheepdog is my bitch now.
This will definitely help my sheep outreach program.
If I may say so, sir, it makes you look a little like a cliché.
Not baaad.
Do you have anything in grandma?
Well, sir, I have to say, it's very ewe...
This wolf in sheep's clothing look is so dated. What can you show me in a bovine 42 long?
Do you think it will fit after a BIG meal?
let me try the "progressive billonaire" suit next...
I would like some human skin to try on now.
I want to look good for my Senate confirmation as Ovine Secretary!
This cocaine is fantastic!
Does this outfit make me look fat, or  should I go with the goat?
Just my luck, I'm allergic to wool.
I am killin’ em out there! Gimme the pig, I think this cliché has run its course.
Throw in the shrunken wool boots and I’ll buy it.
It's b-a-a-a-d.
Do you have one that hides my head?  Because, frankly, this isn't going to fool anyone.
It looks marvelously untrustworthy on you, sir
Very nice sir. May I offer a less cliche
I feel like an ewe man!
This one comes with a complimentary assortment of mint jellies.
I don’t know. Maybe it’s a little too on the nose.
I must say, dear sir, you look deceptively dashing.
Does it come in Grandmother?
Cliche? No. Timeless? But of course.
I like it. Does it come with an extra pair of hocks?
Politics, here I come!
I have the feeling that this is the one for my fairytale wedding.
It suits you to a "t" and then, of course, it goes with the expression.....
Yes, that Grandma outfit was an absolute disas...oh my...hello there you woolly little minx...would you say this is 'white as snow'?
Guaranteed to fool little girls, Mr. Wolf, and for an additional $29.99 something to wear at the house made out of brick.
And you will need to bring home the bacon for further outfits
I don't care if it cliché, I love it!
I’ve been told you have to dress for the food you want, not the food you have.
Have anything a little less revealing?
You're going to score with that one, baby!!
So many herds, so little time.
If this doesn't get me in good with that hot chick Mary, then nothing will!
Sir, may I suggest that another costume may be better to go incognito. The sheep suit is a bit cliche. The White House has done quite well with these two.
I assume that you dress to the right.
Be honest with me Fred.  Am I really fooling anyone?
This display of fake skins will replace our fur salon so  the Peta people can't complain any more!
Clichés always work best. I'll take it.
This will pull the wool over their eyes.
Fierce and ready to pierce with no one the wiser!
Do you think this outfit will fool the poor?
Yes,sir,Mr. Wolf, you’ll absolutely slay them with this sheep’s clothing.
Yes, this is the one!
Now this one is the real me, Al.
Jeeves loves caring for the party animals.
Do you have a matching baa-net?
A timeless classic, to be sure, but still capable of eliciting surprise.
So fashionable, you can wear it anywhere.
You sure it doesn’t make me look fat?
Perfect!  I'll go as a cliche
Thank you for shopping at Idiom Xpress. Don't forget we're having our Two Birds Are Better Than One sale so come back if you need a snack in the grass, a dead horse to beat, or feel like going on a wild goose chase.
Thank you Aesop, I have been searching for the perfect work outfit.
I'll take this AND the Grandma outfit.
Who's afraid of this big bad boy?”
Do you have something that says 'grandmother?'
100% wool yarn... and this mirror is only convincing me to buy it more.
My old one worked well with the pigs, but I'm getting tired of pork. Maybe we should try something new.
I’m going to embrace my Schizophrenia.
My life is such a cliche
A bit cliche, but you do look marvelous!
Yes sir, I assure you each suit is completely vegan, locally sourced, and sustainably produced.
‘Lobby or Houston, Sir?
Harold’s friends  had failed to mention that  it wasn’t THAT kind of fancy dress  party.
Is it me? I think it's me!
I’ll take this one. Last season, in the cow costume, mating season wasn’t fun for me...
Let me see the pig one more time.
So passé!  May I suggest something in stripes?
It’s really you—though I also see you in the leather shearling car coat.
Looks a little tight - maybe I should try the big, bad and tall store.
It's nice, but feels too last-decade.
Are you saying Yes! to the dress?
The three little pigs have a thing for Merino wool.
Do ewe have anything in black?
A wolf in sheep's clothing!  Now that's a great idea!
I think you will find the classics to be timeless
Yes indeed!  Perfect for the petting zoo.
I hope this is what my daughter meant when she wanted an inside zoo.
It’s perfect,
I’ll take it!
If I'm lucky, it will add ten pounds to my hips.
I know I'm being fleeced but I need an extra lair"
This won't do, I'll take the cow !
Perfecto, Bruno. Dressed to kill again!
I love that it’s 42% guaranteed.
I’ll take it! Cash or charge, Mr President?
The innards are sold separately next door.
It brings out the exploiter in you.
But make it slutty.
It's ewe, sir, it's ewe!
Tempting, but what have you got in Kobe beef.
Tasty. And they're the ones who can't see through that.
Sir, I believe you have definitely made the right choice for your outdoor excursion from our extensive bespoke inventory.
It sure beats fur.
Won't it shrink in the wash?
Forget Grandma. Riding Hood will never suspect!
Love it. Now do you have it in something less itchy?
It's 2020, I'm sure they'll appreciate you being you.
Does this come in size husky?”
Can I interest you in another idiom?
We call it the Into the Woods look.
That's the one! I'll baa baa baa buy it
Aah, yes, we've finally come to see the  efficacy of pot.
Yes, most esteemed Sir, I concur, that sheep's clothing fits you wonderfully well.
As a candidate, this will be perfect for the next election.
Sheep is sooo 2016. What animal can I wear for 2020?
Cliché, yes, but the little pigs will never see me coming.
Oh, I like this one. It brings out my soft side.
The little boy who cried wolf grew up into the wolf's wing man
Now that I'm vegan, I can fit into so much more!
This is the look I want when I go out with that Bo Peep chick.
Now the little boy will be crying "SHEEP!"
I agree, the difference between haute couture and haute cuisine is overrated.
Oh yes, this screams me!
It's got you all over it.
This doesn't make me look too sheepish, does it?
Oh! This is much bet...I mean...be-e-e-etter!
Now that's more like it, Sol.
Hollywood--I mean Washington here I come!
Yes, it’s a machine washable wool blend.
And your source?  I like to personally verify humane practices.
Yes, sir, I believe that one is definitely Ewe.
You misheard me. I'm looking for a "cheap" costume.
Sheep is sooo last year.
Taxidermy & Fitch
If my mom calls, you never saw me.
„I’m sure your granddaughter will never recognize you dressed like that!“
Gramma's going to love this!
A cliche, I know. However, sir, it’s soft and fluffy.
Nice—but it's just not you.
And you say this will make them go from "Ewes" to "Ooohs!"?
It looks splendid on you, Mister President.
That’s brand new from 
the Little Bo-peep collection.
The wool’s too itchy. Does this come in Merino?
Looking good in vintage, Sir.
Ewe will love it and your pack of friends will be so jealous.
I'll take this one and the pig in case my wool allergy acts up.
I don’t know.  Is the whole on-the-nose look a little... 2019?
Eric and Don junior don't shoot farm animals, am I right?
I'm vegetarian, but I've always wanted to get under their skin.
SHOW ME THE GRANDMA  COSTUME AGAIN
This year wolves are getting away from sheep's clothing.  The pig might be more your style..
I like it, but does it come in Merino?
Have anything in human?
If you tell me one more time to "make it work" I'm going to slap that bitch ass smirk off your face.
For the new year, might I suggest a 'pig in zebra's clothing' for that cosmopolitan flair?"
I’ve titled this one, ‘Men In Power’
Just remember, you didn't buy it here!
Do you have a Day Trader in my size? I’ll make a killing in the stocks.
Not the pig, I'm kosher.
Just something that doesn't  make me stand out.
Always opt for simple, classic fits and materials.
This costume is great, I look just like a sheep vomiting a whole wolf, which is a good way to attract sheep, perfect job sizing me you smug blind idiot
Does this make my intentions look obvious?
Sir, you chose wonderfully, they’ll never know until it’s too late.
Do you have one that looks like a salesman?
That one is so trite...may I suggest something a bit more daring?
Niiice! But I need to look really b-a-a-a-d... got this in black?
It’s a come as you eat party
A brilliant disguise.
I don't care what people will say. I love the look."
Tell me Sir, how long have you been on the campaign trail?
Does it look like I taste good?
"Is it stain repellent?"
I simply lose myself in this one… wow!, who is that sheep in the mirror?
It has been the most popular,sir...  But these days you never can tell who you might offend.
Cliché or not, I like how this looks.
This one goes well with the ACME rocket boots.
Is this the only color it comes in?
Yesterday, I had a sheep in here wanting wolf clothing
Isn’t the Amazon basics puffy jacket a little too last season?
It's such a cliché and it fits me perfectly.
Ewe look spectacular!
Why does it always have to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing?
It’s 2020.  Time for a fresh start!
If you are certain I will be a smash at the Seder, I’ll take it!
And how shall you dress for dinner tonight sir?
Oh, it's so ewe!
By far our most popular piece
I would go with the sheep’s wool, sir. It’s very deceptive.
Yes, it fits you perfectly, even if it's not entirely presidential.
I want it to make me look fat.
I think I like this one, I look trustworthy in it.
Does this make me look innocent?
Ah, yes, sir, I do believe we have captured the true you!
Instead of saying yes to the dress, we like to ask if you're going to keep the sheep.
This one is on sale?  OK then, let's go with the sheep's clothing.
Ewe only live once.  I’ll take it!
Any of these reversible?
Eat your heart out, Brooks Brothers!
Do you think I'm showing too much?
Welcome to the Politician Boutique.
You'll be a real bite at the Shepards party
Hon, this IS the real me!
Actually sir, I won't need this.  I'll just eat you.
This one really brings out the blood in my eyes.
If I may say Sir. It is ewe.
Makes me feel like that Hollywood producer.
It’s just a little too clichéd, don’t you think?
Perfect!...everything old is new again
This one speaks to me.
Mr do little by day becomes Dr Doolittle by night.
This isn't quite the woolly jumper I had in mind.
2020... Little Bo-Peep is in for a big surprise!
It’s absolutely perfect for the Ed Shearing concert.
Now, is this going to shrink in the wash?
No need to wrap it up. I’ll wear it out.
It's perfect. No way they won't flock to me.
Nice...if a tad literal.
Well, last time this one went horribly wrong, what with that lonely shepherd and all.
If I wear this, will the others in the pack count on me?
It’s cliche, but it works
That suits you so well, sir; shall I wrap it up or would you like to wear it home?
I'm looking for something with a little more meat on the bones
Definitely lamb tonight.
I’ll really pull the wool over there eyes with this one!
This is definitely a killer outfit alright!
It's 100% wool.
It is a classic signature piece yet definitely fashion forward
You're right, 'loose fit' will be perfect if I eat too much.
I'm afraid we are out of merino, sir.
If you are interested, we just received a shipment of grandmother's nightgowns that would look fantastic on you.

Do you have this in black? I'm going home for Christmas.
Here at Prey R Us, we take pride in our wide selection and bespoke tailoring!
It looks like it was made for you
Does this make me look fat?
You don’t think people will say, “My, what big hips she has?”
This is the one!  My first impression is absolutely critical.  Remove the price tag and I will be buffet bound!
Perfect!  The others didn't come close  to an idiom.
Clyde, you’ve outdone yourself.
Yes! All of our garments are authentic.
I'd like to get away from that stereotype look.
Sir, if I may say so, YOU LOOK STUNNING!  Many of my politician clients are choosing shearling this year.
A wolf in sheep's clothes is too cliche
I love hunting for bargains.
Oh, my dear, it looks so much better on you than in you!
So Wolfie...do you say 'yes to the dress?'
It fits okay, but is it 100% wool?
Don't worry, friends, I'll soon wipe that wicked smirk off his face.
It's so fuzzy to the touch, but the price! Are you trying to fleece me?
Ah yes...the classic wolf in sheeps' clothing...it's most certainly you...madam.
You’re an animal, darling
OR...Larry could just embrace schizophrenia and not worry about wardrobe.
Sold!" Talk about nostalgia's nudge!
I live by three rules: buy low, sell high, and always dress like your clients.
And you're sure it's not racially insensitive?
Do you think this makes me too non-threatening?
Mutton without buttons! Oh, Matthew—ewe genius!
Faux? It’s fabulous.
It's gonna have to be this one unless the Zebras take hold of the Senate
Does this outfit make ewe look fat?
This is very warm, sheep thank you.
The grandma look was getting old.
Really suits ewe, sir
A wolf in sheep's clothing has such a sweet ring to it.
Does this make me look approachable?
Sir, “wolf in sheep skin” is our all time best-seller, but “zebra” will kind of boost your originality...just sayin‘...
Every inch of it says ewe.
Ahh, the traditional. Never disappoints. Though I'm tempted to go Full Bovine just once.
Perfect! And I thought this was just a fable.
The rack of lamb sir is an excellent choice!
You seem sold on that one.
This might be a bit warm for house showings
The Sheep was not the wolf's first choice, but he when he put on the costume, he fell in love with the look!
I've been invited to the Metropolitan Ball this year, I need something dazzling
Is this Vegan wool?
Wall Street was a blast, but now I need a little lie down on Broadway.
Who's next, James?
I don’t care what the naa-sayers think, I look great in this
It's an amazing thing...wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better predator."

I present as a wolf but I identify as animal queer, thank you.
Perhaps something a little less cliché, sir...
Yes, but does it make me look fat?"

One can never go wrong with a classic.
BAAAAA!
During fashion week, you go with what you know ...
It doesn't quite howl VEGAN loud enough for my purposes.
If they’re this scratchy, I’m not even sure I want to eat one.
Well I don't FEEL sheepish.
Would you have a Merino in black?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I just don't know.....Do you think this sheepskin makes me look fat?
A little clichéd, don't you think?
It will make for a great idiom.
Sir, I thought you had a wool allergy.
With these plant-based skins, I’m now a wolf in cheap clothing!
Are you sure this is real wool?
Fierce!
Me and the kids are planning a trip to Yellowstone.
Yessiree... this is the ticket!
It looks great  and feels good, but I'm just not that fond of mutton.
It’s all faux, I am aware of your new lifestyle
It's perfect! I'll be confirmed as the Secretary of Grazing in no time!
It's too cliche. Let me look at the utter one.
This one makes your sinister side look great.

Mr. Wolf, what if we tried something a little different this time?
Yes, Mr. Wolf, that coat is definitely you. But remember, your worldwide cruise suite includes your choice of five formal evening-wear attires.
I like it, but it's just so cliche.
Here's one sheep you can count on.
Wow! Rasp! Poopy dooey!
Let’s face it...wool never goes out of favor
It's faux fur, too. For the, uhm, environmentally conscious wolf.
There's no people like snow people...
It just doesn't feel like me at all - I love it.

Pretty, but too cliched.
Is it pre-shrunk?
A classic look indeed, sir.
Metaphors are priceless.
I still think it is not me.
Perhaps you’d like something plant-based?
My momma didn't name me Prophet for nothing you know.
I'll huff and puff and blow your balloons away "
This would be a nice dinner dress, but I already have one like it.
Mr. Wolf, This is soooo ewe.
You can call "fake-fur" and get away with it...
Just be careful not to get the wool over your own eyes, sir.
This ewe is really me!

Heh, heh. I play the wolf in sheep's clothing in the Little Red Riding Hood production.
I hope nobody else wears this to the retirement party

Perhaps something other than wool?
I was really looking for something more in a poly-blend.

Who knew life in the city could be so fabulous."
Wonderful, sir. Have you ever considered a career in politics?"
I've been doing this for 17 years now and they still don't believe him. Aesop would've gotten a kick from this.
When I saw ‘sheep’s clothing’ in the window, I expected them to be your CUSTOMERS. What a pleasant surprise...
I know it’s cliche, but it just feels so good.
That outfit will be splendid for all dining occasions.
I’ll take it! Now to make the pasture great again!
It's horribly cliche but will never go out of style - I love it!
Do you carry a red riding hood?
This cartoon does not need a caption - words are superfluous.
May I present...the cut you ordered.
I think white suits me better
Your "Abattoir-Chic" line is killin' it, Pierre.

You know you drive a mean bargain
I hope this works better than that Grandma costume.
Well, I am looking for something that I can wear every day!
Oh yes, this one. I’ll wear it now, it’s mutton for lunch.
It's kind of cliche, but I can bring something fresh to it.
Just express yourself.
Maybe A New Look
Is this wool?
No, this does mutton for me.
What the flock! I'll take it.
Could I suggest something a little less stereotipical?
We call that one "trickle down economics". It goes quite nicely with your eyes.
I am attracted to the sheep clothing line.
I look so innocent, I'd almost forget I'm wearing fur!
This one screams upper-middle class and my own instagram
Just right! No more of this "safely graze" nonsense.
For some reason, I keep coming back to the wool.
Is it Armani, or...Pelosi?
I love this one but it is so last century.
It's the perfect statement and will last forever."
This dress is perfect! Now I'll try on the next one, if you don't mind.
This lamb is a little snug, let's try the sheep
Diversification’s the key to success these days, my friend.
Your corporate flock raid will be the talk of Wall Street, sir!
Sorry for the delay, you have multiple choices.
I like it. But do you have something in a Grandma style?
'' As requested, the lamb is marinating.``
Does this make what big ears I have look even bigger?
I'll take this and a grandma, if you have one.
Tres cliche.
Can we change the cliche with one outfit?

Is that in the elections end of season sale?
Ooh, this one makes me feel BAAD!
It’s been great doing business with you Mr. Osteen!

So you are looking for a Halloween costume.  For some reason, this one is always popular with our wolf clientele.
It’s perfect. I’ll will take it in white, just for the holidays .
We need to get the smell out of the wool.
This is good, but what do you have in the Grandma look?
Out with the Wolfe, sire - it's the White Metal Rat for 2020.
Do you have something in "Grandma chic"?
This is even BETTER than the Michael Jackson outfit!
This year's elections need a more unexpected distraction....
Do you have anything in unicorn?
Oh, god, yes.
Looking this good is a crime. Specifically murder.
It's me, it's definitely me. Does it come in black?
Do you have it in polyester?
You have a collection to kill for.
"This one doesn't really lend itself to much creativity, does it?
They come runnin' just as fast as they will

Something perhaps in coverup stripes then.....
Irresistible and so snuggly; I'll take it.
Not bad for a ewesed model!
It's sure to be a hit with the ladies
Much better than the udder one.
Be honest, does it make my hind quarters look big?
I can't wait to wreck the dress.
This is the sheepest jacket we sell from the Incog-meat-o collection

Perfect! But, does it come in black...?
Anything in red?
Now you've nailed it...it's me!!
It’s just not the same.

3, 2, 1...lift me up!
I will just check up on a friend and
Sure, pasture chic's a classic style, but do you have anything that breathes?
You got this in black? I'm something of an outcast in my family.
I quite agree that’s always in style
Do you have anything more sheer ?
This new wolf-sheep fetish is really making me rich.
Now this is something you could really sink your teeth into
It's gender-neutral with repurposed materials. I love it!
I’m favoring this vintage look.
They found our hiding place.
he was a wolf in sheeps clothing , she was a party cow from hell.
Do you think it’s a bit passé?
If the idiom fits
Yes this will work, but is it virgin wool?
Yes it's warm and cuddly ... but I'm not sure this brings out the real me.
A Wolf in Sheep’s clothing. It looks so good it should be a cliche.
I find the right dress can really liven up a dinner party.
Good choice, sir. It's from our Emulator Line, for the traditionalist with an ace up his sleeve.
I'm not sure which is worse...That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing or that this establishment exists to cater to my disingenuous nature.
The bible gave me this idea.
Cliche? Perhaps. But still a classic.
Psst. I'm 20 percent off!
They died as they lived: screaming for me to get off of them.
Perfect sir,little kiddies will love it.
Point me to the feigning room.
"The others were okay, sir, but this was the funniest when you baa."
Oh, definitely this one...
But I'll have to change my drag queen name.

Fine wool indeed sir. I should add no animals were harmed in the making.
I don't know, do you think it makes me look fat?
Will that be charged to your Wall Street account or your Political account?
Then you' ll love our granny outfits.
Now you're talking!
Be honest, does it make my ass look big?
The pack said  I'd never make it on Wall Street.
It's the 20's sir, genus be damned...
If you're sheepish about that costume, I have many other fine selections.
What is this material? Idiom?
Cool, but do you have it in black?
Stunning, mister Secretary of the Interior!

I know it’s a bit cliché, but I think people will appreciate the irony.
This one feels itchy.
The fleece was an inspiration!
Jim was looking forward to an evening alone with his animal corpses when a wolf burst out of a motherf**king sheepskin.
I like them all but this is my favorite.
What the udder...?
Ahh, Mr. Wolf, me thinks that one may be out dated.May I offer a different approach?
It’s never easy selecting that perfect wedding dress.
Of course, I know life was simpler on the farm
And this wool will be breathable if a chase is necessary! I'll take it!
I'll take it! I look adorably ravenous.
May we suggest an update?
Showtime!
Got anything that says ACME?
This will do, pigskin is so yesterday.

Here are endangered species for the White House lawn.
Perfect, grandmothers love sheep.
The sheep is really in this season.
This will be perfect for the furry convention.

The Carnivore's Dilemma
By George I think you’ve got it!
Shrewd, Jeeves, shrewd. Apart from the smashingly lovely texture and obvious sex appeal, for purposes of subterfuge...this may be on par with your grandmother scheme.
I agree!  Nothing cries "WOOLF" like this one.
It brings out the real ewe.
Yes. Barnyard is the new Barneys!
I assume you dress right?
Does this skin make my hindquarters look too lean?

Don Dechman, Austin, TX 7873
I'm sure the wolf in sheep's clothing will win Best in Show.
Does it look like it'll make me fat?
Do you think the girls will like it?
If I may say so sir, that's quite becoming... would you like to try that in the '"Big Horn" size?
we’re calling it goat couture
A lover of wool Sir?
I think it's really ewe, sir.
I prefer a classic style.
Pig - too fat; zebra - horizontal stripes, too fat, how about just this little 'fat of the lamb'?
These are just some of the costumes for Taylor Mack's next play on the evolution of mammals.
Yes! This one'll get me to the cottage. Then I 'charm' Grandma, and Red Riding Hood is mine !
The mutton look is the new black.
You were right, nothing beats a classic!
Dead animals or pretending to be animals-I see nothing funny here.
It's as if it was made just for you.
Is it me?
Mr. Wolf - you'll never get away with it; it's too cliche. I've selected some other options that may be less obvious.
Ahh,the perfect fit!


TG Beasley, Newtown, PA
A bit too frothy?
It’s cliche, but I’ll take it!

Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!
You look ravishing sir.
Poodle really brings out your teeth
No sir, doesn't make your posterior look large at all.  If I may say sir, you look positively transformed!
Pierre, do you have this in ba-baa black?
Ewe is the idea,  I'm going in drag
I think I'll stick with the classic.
So, it's the Sheep Couture, Mr. Wolf ?
Cannot decide which dinner will make me look more fabulous.
My New Year's resolution this year was to wear more upcycled clothing.
Well, you can never go wrong with this classic style.
Don't you have anything in mineral
This one might make you look innocent the best!
You can turn the other cheek all you want, but
a wolf is a wolf and it takes one to know one!

This one is very 2019, do you have anything more modern?
Machine-washable wool? I’ll take it.

It’s me, I mean, mahhh.
Behold the award winning couture of the season...Wolf in Lambs wool cloak
I love it, but where's the rest?  I'm starving.
His neighbors had always suspected that Frank was hiding something.
You can thank Gospel of Matthew 7:15, King James Version for this idea.
Very appealing, indeed! Will sir be wearing the 'mutton getter' home?
I think I'm a furry.
Kukla, Fran & Ollie, now that was a class act!
Good! Now how to change my howl to a bleat.
Is this the only "retro-sheep" option you have?
You were made for this look"
I was looking for something that is really me. Do you have a wolf?
The last time I wore this it caused quite the commotion.
Ugh, when you find The One budget really flies out window...
I can't believe you murdered Frank and his friends for their skin!
Perhaps the stripe one would be more sliming
Aloysius was being fleeced but he stood to make a killing.
Now I can infiltrate all the crime families! The BoPeeps, the BoPigs, the BoPebras,...
This one is Insta-worthy.
I'll take this in the bovine and porcine as well.
“You really should try some non alcoholic drinks next time, no matter what Susie says.”

The sheepskin is always an excellent choice this time of year...
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Suits you, sir.  Bravo.
Not "look"...will it make me fat?
Nice- but do you have something in a Merino, or a Rambouillet?
A wolf in sheep's clothing- a very popular choice!
It was an exhausting year I agree - but I didn’t think it would make you drink this much!
It's glamorous enough,
but the civil look isn't very chic this season.
Wow, I'm finally me.  I look so fine I'll probably become a meme.
Ah, yes! A Democrat In Name Only!
Love it...but does it make me look fat?
Oh darling, it was made for you...and shearling is all the rage this year!
This one will surely blow them away!
That is so 'not you' you.
‘Leisure  suit ? I disagree !’
No need, this is exactly what's needed.
Do you have this in a ewe?
I love it.  It’s so cliche he’ll never dream it’s me before he falls asleep.
Fleece definitely suits you!
I'm leaving - you've proven yourself a sheep in salesman clothing
Yeah...on the GOP ticket.
I told you - the cheap price tag is deceiving.
Taxidermy: A Dying Art
They're very popular sir, for every single one we sell we get three coming in!
I love it -- it's so not me

I believe being a "wolf in sheep's clothing" will suit you better than the pig, cow or mountain goat selections.
Stripes are very slimming.
Prey tell, you don't think it's a little too obvious?
No question, sir. It is absolutely ewe.
Now, sir, this one is finally YOU! And, it's our Lon Chaney Jr. exclusive design. It is also 100% imported wool.
Old McDonald "HAD" a farm! eA eA Oh!

It's 100% lamb's wool  including the element of surprise.
I’m happy with my new skin, but I’ll be dammed if I’m able to grow into it.
It really brings out your fangs.
It's PERFECT..but would you have it in a cable knit?
-Excuse me, Is there any medium size of lamb?
 -No, they are extinct
I'm supposed to dress as my favorite cliche'.  This will do.
Yes, it is slimming and so flatters one's physique!
Do you have something a little less wooly, I'm looking to blend in.
You see that animals can have another purpose other than food.
Sooo more becoming, it’s me.
Love it, I'll take 99 more.
heard somewhere that sheep vaginas are the animal vaginas most like human vaginas—that’s why sheep are always gettin fucked. one reason anyhow. anyways, this one here, uh, you got any that’s vagina’d?
Are we having carrots for dinner.
You’re right. It’s so much more flattering thank the elk.
Sweet deal! I eat 'em, you fleece 'em.
I'll pay you back by the end of the week, with interest.
May I say, madame looks splendid as a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I don’t like to look aggressive.
I only wear faux fur.
This is much more ewe than that grandma thing you came in wearing.
You're right. The wool does soften up my body language.
This is perfect man. Drop those duds and let's try on some cloven heels!
And if you want something a little less traditional, there’s nothing Grimm about  this bold Zebra print...
Jesus said you'd love it. It will match with the Serpent scarf and the Dove handbag.

I bet I could fire a shot down 5th Avenue and no one would notice
Do you think the cliché's too obvious?
Looks like you are pulling off this outfit quite well, Sir!
I love it!  It's so counter-intuitive!
Little Bo Peep is in for a sheepish surprise!
Yes, Yes, my wife would like all of these!  heh heh
I’m looking for something a little more current… Something I could accessorize with a selfie stick.

Though I realize you're trying to fleece me, it seems worth the investment in the long run.
If I may say sir,  you look marvelous in sheep's clothing
I think I prefer the beige.

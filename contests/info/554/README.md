This caption contest was also live on the New Yorker caption contest page
(ads).

According to the New Yorker, "[the site is] working well (and faster) than
before".

This week, for all captions that had at least one duplicate caption, I included a single, exact duplicate of the original caption for comparison purposes. These duplicate captions are listed below:

C’mon, live a little.
C’mon, live a little.
No, thanks. I'm just here to kill time.
Just one. I have to get up in the morning and you don't.
Last call? You have no idea.
Here's to you and taxes.
C’mon, one won’t kill ya.
Here’s to drinking like there’s no tomorrow.
Can't - I'm on the job.
Last call.
Thanks, but I prefer spirits.
I guess one more won’t kill me
After flirting with Death all afternoon, Bob finally makes his move.
“Last Call” You probably hear that a lot
It's happy hour? Well this is awkward.
Last call.
No thanks. I'm waiting for someone.
I swear I used to be everyone's biggest fear until some time late last January
No thanks, I prefer spirits.
The good news--no hangover tomorrow...
Okay, you got one more day if you're buying.
Ironically it is Miller time... Mr. Miller.
I said "you're toast", not "your toast"
You look like you're ready for a cold one.
I think I'll pass. I'm your designated driver.
Sure, I’ve got a few minutes to kill.
No thanks. I'm the designated reaper.
No thanks, I prefer spirits.
A quick one but then we have to go.
I must admit you're taking it really well.
None for me, thanks. I'm your designated driver.
Hey buddy, one drink ain't gonna kill ya!
I'm here for last call.
I've always preferred you over taxes!
Nah, you have 'em both. I'll see you on the drive home.
Thanks, but I only consume spirits
No, thank you, I have to work in a few minutes.
You play hockey ??
Last call, buddy.
In his current, inebriated state, Walt didn't realize he was flirting with Death.
No thanks. And you might want both of them.
Thanks, but one of us has to wake up tomorrow morning.
I don't think you should run a tab.
So I tells my old lady, 'Oh yeah, well, maybe I'll have two tonight, and maybe I won't come home.
Here's to a long life.
Does this mean Happy Hour is over?
Hey … we’re both left-handed.
Actually, a cold one is exactly what I had in mind
Aw, c'mon, another one isn't gonna kill either of us.
Live a little.
Here! Don't look so grim.
“To life” – really?
Looks like we're both here to grab a cold one.
If that's pumpkin spice, I'll have to kill you.
Sorry, I don't drink and scythe.
On the bright side, you won't be hungover.
I wish I could, but I'm with a client right now.
This one's on me, looks like you had a day from hell.
Have a beer man, you look pretty grim.
I got you the dark ale.
Thanks!....I love cold ones.....
Live a little.
No thanks. I never drink and scythe!
Thanks, but no thanks...it goes right through me.
I take it happy hour is about to end!
I have time for just one and, to be honest, so do you.
Beer today; gone tomorrow.
Happy hour isn’t really my thing.
What part of "Last Call" did you not understand?
Don't tempt me.
Come on, it won't kill you to have another one.
Um, the bet wasn't a beer, Dave...
Thanks, but I don't drink when I work.
I’d kill for a nice cold one.
All right, one more. But then it's time, Mr Miller.
I swear this will be my last one.
No, thanks. I have to go to work in about two minutes.
No thanks. I'm here on business.
EVEN BETTER, c’mon to my place an’ we’ll watch porn.
Are you meeting someone or just killing time?
No thanks. I'm waiting for someone.
You look like I need a drink.
Any friend of Steve Bannon is a friend of mine!
I guess one drink won't kill me.
That stuff will kill you.
Yeah, actually, I'd kill for one right now...
If you say 'To Life' one more time, we're going to have a problem.
Thanks, but I think you’re going to need them both.
Okay, but it’s your funeral.
I suppose one drink wouldn't kill me.
Ha, ha, what an outfit. You're killing me!
Wow! When they say last call, they really mean it.
I hear ya, buddy boy. A dead-end job is just the worst. Bottoms up.
Here's to you and taxes.
Here's to 2018.
You do know this puts a little damper on happy hour...
Sorry, I can't. I'm your designated driver.
Let's drink as if there is no tomorrow.
So I take it happy hour is over?
No thanks, had to give it up, kept getting wrong names and addresses.
No thanks. I never drink and scythe!
I've been coming to this place for years but have never seen it this dead.
Thanks, but I prefer spirits.
No thanks...that stuff will kill you.
I've got some bad news about happy hour.
When you say ‘last call’, we’re still just talking about closing my tab, right?
Here dude... Thanks for clearing my field.
Go ahead, one more won’t kill you.
Aw, thanks, I could kill for a cold one right now.
No, thanks. I'm just here to kill time.
Thanks, but I'm more into spirits.
Yeah, buddy - Obamacare really hurt my business, too.
I’m only interested in spirits.
Well, I guess one wouldn’t kill me
That's one hell of a bottle opener.
Tough week, eh? You look like Death.
Sorry Buddy, I only do spirits.
No, thanks. I don't drink and scythe.
Here you go: last call!
Nah, that stuff will kill ya.
Thanks, but I can't. I'm on the job.
You know, before the election, people feared me.
I guess one more wouldn't kill me.
Yeah, last call buddy.
Let's have one for the road.
No thanks, I'm your designated driver tonight.
You can have them both. I'll wait.
One more. Then I'm cutting you off.
Fair to assume I won't be having a hangover tomorrow?
That stuff will kill you.
The President just nominated me for Surgeon General.
You know, that stuff will kill you.
And if I win, you visit my mother in law.
Trust me, you won't be needing two.
Well, okay, then, we’ll drink to YOUR health....
How many of these will it take for you to forget why you came?
Did my wife send you?
No thanks, I'll have two in a minute.
This is not what I meant by Last Call.
Hey, live a little!
Oh, no thank you. One of those and I become the REALLY grim reaper.
Then I say "Dang, thought this was apartment 12".... You should see their faces!
Last call...indeed.
I can't drink. I'm driving my motor sickle.
No thanks. I'm just waiting for someone.
Thanks, but when I said I could use a "cold one" I meant you.
Okay one more, then you really gotta go.
OK here's the deal. I'll buy you a beer, and you go out with my mother-in-law.
No thanks, I'm your Designated Driver.
Tonight we drink 'til I drop.
You do realize you're flirting with Death...
Would you mind taking this to my wife?
Oh alright...... but I’m not changing my mind.
C'mon, man, live a little.
I assume this means Happy Hour is over?
No, no. I said, "You're toast".
I would kill for a drink
Don't tempt me.
No, you have it wrong. The end is BEER.
No thanks. I'll just wait for you to be finished.
Nice try.
It's always nice to see a fellow drinking like there's no tomorrow.
What are we celebrating?
I suppose one drink wouldn't kill me.
Awful nice of you to die me a brink.
Have a beer, you look like hell.
No, I will not drink to your good health.
Actually, I'm just here for the bartender, but thanks anyway.
join me for the last call?
No beer for me. Just spirits.
No thanks. I don’t like the person I become when I drink.
Drink up. Your happy hour is about over.
To Life!
Here's the deal! I buy you a beer. You promise to come back for me if he's re-elected.
On the plus side, I see you've been drinking like there's no tomorrow.
Thanks, but I'm more of a spirits guy.
I really admire a person who flirts with death.
Looks like you could use a cold one, Mr. Bannon.
Is the reaping still as grim as it used to be?
I was just toasting democracy in America and you showed up. How about that?
hello darkness my old friend
I can't, it'll go right through me
So I guess this really is last call, huh?
Last round’s on you.
No thanks. The stuff goes right through me.
Not tonight, I'm the designated reaper.
It's pretty dead in here tonight.
Come on, pal. Live a little.
Sure, I've got time for a quick one. You...maybe not.
OK, just one more, then we really need to go.
Last call already?
Humor me, how’s a guy like you still single?
Last call it is.
Can't. I'm your designated driver.
Well, if you're sure that Charlie isn't coming back, you can have his beer.
hello darkness my old friend
I appreciate it, but what I actually said was ‘If I could only have one more year.’
I just realized what you meant by 'last call'.
That's not quite what I meant by 'cold one.'
C'mon buddy, live a little!
Congrats on the new job, I'm sure you're going to kill it
Thanks, but I can't drink beer. It goes right through me.
Sure, I'd kill for a beer.
Have a beer. Eddie never comes in till around 10.
Yes--yes! Now that you mention it, I do come here often.
I hate to give away the ending, but you'll be missing the last 13 minutes of happy hour.
So, are you in town on business?
Can you believe my luck tonight? It's buy one get one free!
C'mon - one drink won't kill you!
You look like you had a killer day at work today.
Thanks, buddy. This really is last call!
I'm his designated driver.
C'mon. One beer won't kill you.
No thanks, I'm still working
Hey! You with the hoodie and hockey stick! Last call...!
Come on! One drink ain't gonna kill you!
I can help you stop drinking for good.
Well, you sure look like a republican to me.
Thanks, but I'm more of a Spirits kind of guy
Sure I'll have another, its not like it will kill me!
You’ve had more than enough. Now get in your car and drive.
I'm not afraid of you... I was married to your sister for 35 years...
Drinks are on me. I just won the lottery!
Hey, buddy! Have a beer on me. I just won 300 million dollars.
Thanks, most people wouldn't be caught dead or alive buying me a beer.
Cheers! To the future!
Here's to you and the horse you rode in on!
I've worked the graveyard shift too, brother, this one's on me.
The last one and then we go. I promise.
Here, lighten up. You used to be such a happy reaper.
Thanks but I usually go for something a bit darker.
This one's for you? Funny, I was about to say the same thing.
The only way you'll get this beer is if you pry it out of my cold dead hands.
Are you flirting with me?
Well, this is going to be awkward.
Just have one - to take the edge off.
Hey, buddy, why so grim?
Thanks, but I need to stay grim.
You know it’s last call, right?
To taxes!
That’s not what I meant by “I’m here to get a cold one.”
This changes nothing.
Well if it's last call, I am having two.
I'll take that drink, pal. By the way-- don't try to cross 5th Avenue at 3:27 pm next Tuesday.
Looks like you could use a drink, bud. You look like hell...
Thanks! And hey…don't worry about your tab.
You just missed him. May as well have his beer
Well, this is awkward.
Well, if you're sure John is not coming then you might as well have his beer
This one on me -- you see, I don't fear death so much as I fear being sober
I like mine without a head.
My wife told me someday I'd drink myself to death.
One more wouldn't kill you.
Past, Present, and Future walk into a bar. It was tense.
After you hear what I'm about to tell you, you might want both.
Last time someone bought me a drink was the last time someone bought me a drink
Are you kidding me; that stuff will kill you.
I have a boyfriend.
Uh, sure. I don't think she'll mind if I'm a little late.
Thanks, but I can't accept gifts from clients.
No, I will not drink to your health.
Dammit, why is everyone so happy to see me this year?
Ironically, Jim drank himself to death by drinking to Death.
Kinda dead in here tonight.
Thanks, bud; reaping the souls of so many Republicans has got me beat.
Yeah, but you took the guy I bought it for. Enjoy!
I really shouldn't. It goes right through me.
Why don't YOU join ME instead?
Looks like you could use a stiff one.
Can I buy you a beer? You look like hell.
I must warn you, my friendships don't last long.
OK, but only because you can’t take it with you.
You can't cheat death, but you can bribe him.
Sure, I'll have a drink with you. I've got a lot more free time now the GOP is doing my job.
Thanks, friend. Still won't change August 19th, 2018...
What a relief, I thought taxes would get here first.
Cheer up. When this administration implodes, people will fear you again.
No, thank you. I'm your designated driver tonight.
No thanks. It just runs right through me.
No, thanks. I'm just here to see if anyone knows my name.
On the contrary, last call is on me.
Nah, I think you're going to need that more than me.
Go ahead. Live like there's no tomorrow.
Last call already?
Death of an Alesman.
Sorry, I work the graveyard shift.
I'm dying for a drink
I'm waiting for the priest and the rabbi. The joke didn't specify a time.
No, thanks . . . that stuff will kill you.
So, you're just in town for an epidemic?
Who do you have to kill to get served around here?
No, thanks. Waiting for last call.
Thanks, but I can't. I'm driving you home tonight.
I guess one drink won't kill me.
Steve Bannon!!! I haven't seen you since high school.
Steve Bannon, is that you?
I guess one more wouldn't kill me.
Thanks but beer just goes right through me.
Make that 'to go', bud.
Take my hand and walk towards the Lite.
No hard feelings. No one looks like their profile picture.
Hey, at least you've got a job.
Thanks, but neither one of us has time.
Thanks, Frank, but I think you're gonna need that more than I do.
None for me, thanks. I'm reaping.
Here, have a beer. My job is similar and lonely as well. I'm the chair of the Senate Health Committee.
You keep it. I'm driving.
Flirt with me all you want, I can't get rid of your student loans.
Don't worry about the tab.
Thank you. Not right now, I'm working.
Ah! A man who likes to tempt fate!
Funny that you think this is a "happy" hour...
You don't know what I do,do you?
No, really...you look like you’ve had a week.
I'm just killing time, you?
Can I at least bring these with me?
Why not, I’m just killing time.
No thanks pal, I'm your designated driver
Would it kill them to put out some beer nuts?
"No thanks, I'm just here for take out.
No thanks, that stuff will...actually, you drink it.
No thanks. I don't drink when I'm working.
You’re toast.
Funny , but I have a last call for you as well
One for the road?
Nah, you have it. You got your car keys, right?
No thanks. I'm the designated reaper.
It's 666 somewhere, right?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do come here often.
Don’t mind if I do. Today has been a killer.
See if this helps take the edge off.
I guess this is the last call for both of us.
Well in that case, I'm buying.
Death walks into a bar...
No, thanks. I'm on duty.
A LITE BEER, MORTAL? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??
You're obviously dying to share a beer with someone
Come on over and I'll explain what the estate tax law changes will mean for your business
You are not the scariest thing out there, anymore, pal.
One for the road, pal?
Sure, I'll drink to your good fortune . . . but then I gotta tell you something
If you are taking me with you for all of eternity, then you are going to need this.
No thanks, I've already killed enough brain cells.
Slide on over buddy - I've been dying to talk to someone.
No thanks. I'm more into spirits.
... actually, I'd kill for a lite beer...
I almost never buy beer for a stranger, but I’ve just got a good feeling about you.
You're damned if I do, you're damned if I don't.
I thought last call wasn’t for another hour.
Here’s mud in your socket.
C’mon! One more won’t kill you.
Don't beer the reaper.
Why thank you kind sir. I am kind of parched after spending the day destroying the federal government and the American way of life.
I suppose your aneurysm could wait a few more minutes. I'm parched!
No, it's not Halloween. Next guess?
To a long life!
That stuff goes straight to my feet.
Yes, it's Miller Time, Mr. Miller
Thanks – don't mind if I do. I'm bone-dry.
To taxes!
It's 1 am. I'm here for your 1:30 drunk driving accident.
Yes I am here for a cold one.
No thanks, I'm still on the clock
I prefer a darker brew
That actually brings me to why I'm here.
You sure it's gluten free?
I guess you might as well finish his beer.
You look like you're dying for a beer
Thanks, but I sort of prefer it without the head
Sure is dead around here tonight.
Beats me why he lit out of here so fast. You might as well have his beer.
Oh, c’mon — a couple of beers never killed anybody.
Come on, pal. Live a little.
Naa, I gotta go, my wife is gonna kill me!
Thanks, but beer goes right through me.
No thanks, tonight I’m here for spirits.
Well, if I only have time for the one, you may as well have the other.
No Thanks, H.R. has advised me to keep things professional.
Well, subtlety didn't work, so here's one for you: Death walks into a bar...........
Drink up . . . it's last call.
Can't. Gluten.
Come on, it's last call
Sure, I'll have a beer. I told Grandma I'd give her five more minutes.
What the heck, let's live a little.
This is definitely the last call.
I guess this is my last call. Join me?
I really shouldn't, I'm on the clock.
All right, one more for the road, but then we gotta go.
You know I don’t, and now you’re just stalling.
So...I guess this is last call.
I can wait. You still have an hour on the meter.
I can't - I'm the designated survivor.
No thanks. I'm here on business.
Stay for another round ... this game just went into sudden death!
Here.....you look like you've had a rough day.
Last round?
Last call's on me.
A couple more rounds and I might just leave with you.
One drink's not gonna kill you.
Sorry mate, we don’t serve spirits here.
You look like death--here, have one on me.
No thanks. I had a cold one earlier.
One more won’t kill you
I'm here for last call.
Relax, have a beer. You have plenty of time before the new health-care bill is passed.
I feel your pain. Being compared to Steve Bannon could really tarnish your reputation.
Come on, cheer up. It might be just one term.
Just the one. I'm on a deadline.
Cheers? I don't often hear that.
Cheer up! It's not the end of the world.
Okay, but when happy hour ends I'm cutting you off.
I love it when happy hour meets last call.
Fine, one more year.
Is this the last call?
OH, you must be my Uber guy.
I'll take the beer...but don't think you're off the hook.
To your night off!
No thanks, that stuff'll kill you.
Thanks for the beer but I'm more into spirits.
You really weren't kidding about the "last call" were you?
Thanks - the guy was a real asshole.
I would chug them if I were you.
To my health!
Would it kill you just to try one?
Yeah, I don't think it's the outfit mate. Here, just have a beer.
No thanks, I have to work tonight.
You might want to sip yours.
And the good news is your tab will be wiped clean.
OK, one more, but we really have to go after this one
Cheers to a near-death experience!
Here's to a long life.
Well, I guess one more wouldn't kill me.
Hey, why so grim?
Oh c’mon, one won’t kill you!
No thanks, I'm off gluten.
No thanks, the stuff just runs right through me.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with us both getting stiff.
You don't have to stay here, but you can't go home.
Thanks, but I’m gluten free.
You ARE off duty, aren't you?
To Life!...or not.
So what certainty are we drinking to, death or taxes?
Sure. And I'll drink to no more taxes.
OK, but this is the last one.
Sure. I'll join you for last call.
I feel like hell. You look like hell. Country's going to hell. Oh what the hell. Have a beer.
Thanks, but you only have time for one more.
'Last Call'...hum, I'm gonna start using that!
Here’s to a long and healthy life
L'Chaim!
Stick around, have a beer, my mother-in-law will be here soon.
I'm flattered, but you should know you're flirting with death.
I'd toast to your health ... but we both know it won't make a difference.
You don’t get why I am here, do you?
Now that taxes are no longer certain, here's to 'Death!'
No thanks, man. That's how I ended up with this job in the first place.
This one's on me - you look like death warmed over!
Yes, thanks! And I will gladly pry it from your cold, dead hands.
Ever since November 8th, 2016, people have been quite happy to see me coming!
Are you my designated driver?
I need it - I've been unseated as the world's scariest man.
I'll tell ya, it's nice to watch men in Hollywood kill their own careers for a change.
I didn't say 'make a toast.' I said 'you are toast.'
Fine. One beer. But then we've gotta go.
Oh, what the hell. One won't kill me.
No thanks, I only came in for the atmosphere
It's about time you got here! Have a drink and take me outta here, before Trump starts the Apocalypse.
No thanks, I’m the designated driver this evening.
I will, thanks. Been a killer of a week.
Here’s, to drinking and driving
The name's Taxes...Joe Taxes.
Thanks, but I really shouldn't. Whenever I drink I feel like death the next morning.
"What's your poison?" Ha! Ha! Cheers!
Oh no thank you, I much prefer the spirits here.
Go ahead -- one won't kill you
I'd love one. But unfortunately for you, I'm on the job.
Yeah, sure. I been dying for a beer.
"One before "lights out"?
I'm sorry, you look nothing like your profile picture.
"Only if you promise to drive me home".
...But the GOOD news is that you won't have a hangover in the morning.
No thanks, I’m partial to spirits.
You were in that Bergman film, right?
No really, this is last call.
I’m good. That stuff’ll kill you.
Have one on me. Looks like I don't need to worry about the tab.
Gotta little time to kill?
No thanks, I'm gluten free.
Join you? Ahhh, what the hell.
I’m afraid neither of us has the time.
It's a little too late for that.
I've polished off quite a few myself.
No, you take both. You won't be driving tonight.
Hail to thee, blithe spirit
Thanks pal, but it just goes right through me.
Busy day?
You’re right, I am looking forward to a cold one
C'mon...it won't kill ya.
What´s your hurry? Lets share a last one and then I´ll drive you home.
Thanks. I am a bit dry.
I'd love one--work was hell today.
Sure. We'll call it one for the road.
So what brings you here?
(Hmmm. Either I drink with him now to be polite before I kill him, or I can just kill him now and I'll get to drink both beers).
No, thank you. Beer goes right through me.
You only die once.
I would, but beer goes straight through me.
Thanks, but I don't have the stomach for it.
Go on ... it won't kill you!
Seriously, last call.
Don't worry, after the 2 for 1 happy hour the place will be dead.
Don't worry. I'm here for the bartender
I guess another drink wouldn't kill me.
You look like someone who could kill for beer.
No thanks. I'm tonight's Designated-Reaper. See you on the road home, though.
This one is on me. Love you guys from Breitbart
Thanks, but beer tends to run right through me.
Have one. It won’t kill you.
That stuff'll kill ya.
OK. One for the road. But then we're outta here.
Don't worry, it's gluten-free.
Is it always this dead here?
This new IPA is to die for.
Thanks, man. I'd kill for a cold one.
Kinda gives 'last call' a whole new meaning, doesn't it?
Want a beer? You look like death!
One more. Then you’re done.
You just knock back both of them. I’ll wait for you in the car.
I'm serious Tom, this is the last call.
Have a beer, live a little.
This is the fifth time you've pulled this, Dave- you know that I can't hold my liquor.
Cheers mate. Nice to meet you. I'm from down under too.
Oh go ahead, have one. It won't kill you.
C'mon. You only live once.
Perhaps in another life.
No thanks—-that stuff goes right through me.
No, thanks, but I can be your designated driver.
Thanks, but I never drink on the job.
It's your lucky day: I found your car keys too.
A toast to three weeks without a smoke!
Thanks, but no thanks. I am your designated driver tonight, you know.
No thanks....you'll be needing them both, I'm afraid.
You may want to close your tab too.
Thanks, but I'll pass. I don't like to drink and scythe.
One more for the end of the road?
Here's to tomorrow!
Here have a glass. Can I set you up on a blind date with my mother-in-law?
Not sure where my friend just disappeared to, but you can have his beer.
If that's a Guinness, you get another decade.
Awh, come on, one won't kill ya.
That's...not why I'm here.
Thanks, but I really shouldn't be drinking on the job.
That is not the ‘Samuel Adams’ I am here to collect.
To hell with last call.
Why not, it is last call.
Say goodbye to your hops and drams.
Why don't you kill them both?
The hell you say. One for the road, then.
Have a beer, buddy. You look grim.
No seriously, what's your poison?
Thanks, but I never drink on the job.
Cheers to remaining the only thing certain in this world
I've got sobering news.
I can't. I'm working.
Looking for a cold one?
I can't, it goes right through me.
C’mon, one beer won’t kill ya.
Looks like you could use a bier!
Here pal, what could possibly go wrong?
I never met a celebrity before.
The last one’s on me.
Oh c’mon, one won’t kill you!
I'll wait for you in the car.
Thanks for giving me back my car keys, mister.
Bottoms up.
My wife should be here in a few minutes. Have a beer.
Hey buddy, care to join me for last call?
How did you know I’d like the Pale Ale?
No, thanks. I'm tonight's designated reaper.
Whatever doesn't kill you!
Want a drink? You look like death.
I promise this is my last one.
Here's to new beginnings.
C'mon, one drink wouldn't kill you.
I don't need your assistance. When I get home tonight my wife's going to kill me.
Well, OK. But I insist - the last round's on me.
Naw--let's stick around a little longer.
Steve? Is that you?
No thanks...that stuff will kill you.
Join me?
I guess another beer wouldn't kill me.
C'mon, give it a try--it won't kill ya'!
Let's drink to your health!
L'chaim? Really?
At this hour, it’s usually dead in here.
Have a drink. It ain't over yet.
RIP? No, IPA!
Last ones on me!
You're a 'glass-half-full' kinda guy, amiright?
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world...
Would it kill you to have a little fun.
No thanks. I'm not allowed to drink during Happy Hour.
Nah, that stuff always goes right through me.
No thanks. I'm due at the White House.
Hey, haf a lil drinky poo with me. You never know when death could be staring you in the face.
I'd love to, but I'm the designated reaper tonight.
You're here for the beer, right?
I'd drink both if I were you.
I love how dead this place is.
Would it kill me to buy you a round?
No thanks, it always goes right through me
No thanks, I’m watching my carbs.
Not so grim, my friend.
Have a drink. You look like death.
How YOU doin'?
Sorry ‘bout yer beer, but right now, I need ‘em both !!
No thanks, but I'll let you give me a ride home.
."Hi. Waiting for someone. ?"
None for me, booze is the real killer
No, I don’t have any plans this evening. Why do you ask?
No, thanks. You know what they say, "an eternity on the hips."
1600 Pennsylvania Ave? Gif me a minute, I'll dwive you there m'self.
Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in this dive.
Skull!
My boss is the devil too!
Why is it I always get stuck with the tab?
About that "last call" you just responded to...
No thanks, I'm your Designated Driver.
Thanks. But not while I’m working.
Thanks, but I think you’d better drink both of them.
Last call? You have no idea.
I guess one, wouldn't kill me.
Thanks! I'd toast you, too, but you're already toast.
Maybe I don’t want to ‘live a little.’
Well, my wife sure warned me there'd be hell to pay when I got the tab!
You’re looking a little grim. This one’s on me.
Relax pal! You look like death hungover.
I'm willing to reach across the aisle if you are.
You go ahead. I'll wait.
Here's to thankless jobs - but hey, at least we're working, right?
No thanks. I'm reaping later.
I take it you're not a happy drunk
It’s on me, Mr Bannon!
No buddy, to your health.
Thanks, here's to a long life
It's no longer happy hour.
Thank you, but just so you know, I have a boyfriend.
"Believe it or not, I'm actually here for the hat".
I do believe I would settle for that head and body.
Death? Hi, Death, I'm Joe.
I'm more of a Bloody Mary guy myself.
I'd love to, but it'll just go right through me.
How many years does a floral yet hoppy IPA from Vermont get me?
Thanks for takin’ care of the mother-in-law
To death.
Here's to the Middle Class whom I shall remember with fondness.
You bet your life I would!
Aw, c'mon. Have a beer...it's not gonna kill you!
C'mon life is short, live a littel!
Would you like to have a beer-death experience?
It's good for the soul.
Who’s a guy gotta kill to get a drink around here?
Hey, pal, why so grim?
Seriously, drink will definitely be the death of you.
You don't know who I am, do you?
Thanks, but it goes right through me.
No thanks, I don't drink on the job.
Now that tax reform is done, you're all that's left.
Okay, but the next one's on me
It's on me-they just repealed my tax.
'Would I be interested in a COLD ONE? Huh? You tryin' to be funny, mister?'
I'll wait for you in the car.
This takes blacking out to a whole new level.
No thanks. Where you're going, you'll wish you had both.
If you can lose your job to automation . . .who's next?
I wouldn't be too worried about racking up a tab if I were you either.
No thanks, I'm the designated... Oh, what the hell, one's not going to kill me, right?
OK. But just one more - then we really gotta go!
Drink up...it's LAST call.
Drink up, you deserve it! You got that tax bill passed!
No thank you, I'm going to be your designated driver, tonight!
Here's to Life!
I'd rather have a Zombie.
How about a stiff one?
To Life!
One more before I go?
Is that a draft or is it me?
You're just in time. I'm running a tab.
Just one. It goes right through me.
This one is on me pal, please tell me it's your day off.
You voted for Trump too? Sweet. Want some of this antifreeze? Never tried it before but it sure smells good and I heard it gets you really fucked up.
You should have yours 'to go!'
I got a call from your liver.
Enjoy them while you can because this is last call.
Make it one for the Reaper, and one more for the road.
Well - only if you're driving.
Always good to get a drink in before the graveyard shift
Why don't you finish them both and speed things up for me?
No, I won't join you, but ironically you will be joining me.
Well I've just met you and I don't think you're a buzz kill at all.
No Thanks. I’m waiting for someone. Drink up.
You look like hell. Have one on me.
Thanks, buddy, I'm here for you too-- drink's on me!
Thanks, but it might affect my aim.
Bet you can’t kill this beer!
Farmer, ay?
You better “chug” those.
Fears!
You look like you need this more than I do, buddy.
No thanks, I am on the job.
A beer death experience
Here, you can get me the next time.
I said I wanted a bier.
Relax! I'm just here to unwind between clients.
Oh yes, after I swipe off that head.
I always just miss happy hour.
I suppose one wouldn’t kill me.
Here's to life, or what's left of it.
To good spirits!
I thought you were dead!
Do you stutter or really say’last last call’?
Have a drink. You're looking grim.
Well I guess one won't kill me!
You just need to live a little.
Here's the deal. First one finished has to leave ... alone.
Thanks! Work was murder this week.
You look like a pale ale kind of guy.
No thanks. I'm still on the job.
Just in time for the last call!
You look like death warmed over. Have a frosty one?
Thanks my man; I'll wait till you're done.
I can tell you, that stuff will kill you.
Thanks, but I'm working.
I can’t. I’m your designated driver.
My pleasure. I had a very good year.
No, let me buy. It's quite literally last call.
Thanks, I'd kill for one.
Drink up. You can't take it with you.
Well okay, I suppose another one won't kill me.
No, thanks. I try not to drink and scythe.
Now that you mention it, I do come here often. But most people don't call me baby.
Have a beer on me and tell me all about your next appointment.
No thanks, you'll need it when you see who's up there.
'No thanks, I don't like to drink and scythe.'
This one’s on me. It’s last call.
One's not gonna kill you...
Taste this new microbrew. It’s killer.
Shall we go merrily into this good night?
Here's to the "death tax"!
Such a relief not to have to worry about end-of-life care.
Yes, thanks. That'll buy you another 15 minutes.
Last call. Care to join me?
I'll wait.
Yes, I will share a beer with you Mr. Miller, since it is your time.
OK OK you CAN take it with you.
Sure. One more won't kill me.
I will gladly join you but then there’s somewhere you have to be.
To life, to life , l'chiam
I might be grim, but I still enjoy Happy Hour.
Thanks, but I never drink when I’m working.
Sure, I'll have one. After all, it is last call!
No, thanks. Go ahead and drink up. You're won't be driving tonight.
Oh, come on; one beer won't kill ya!
You had me at "hello".
Is it offensive if I say l'Chaim?
Killer week?
No thanks, I'm still on the clock
Drink as much as you want. I'll drive.
Bottoms up, Harry, it's last call.
My doctor said stop drinking. But what’s it going to do, kill me?
How do they toast people where you come from?
Here fella, have a drink. It doesn't look like it could do you any harm.
Oh no thank you, I'm working
May you be in heaven half an hour befor the devil knows you're dead.
Umm, yes. I suppose I have been 'killing it' today.
Oh come on, one little beer isn't gonna kill you.
Hell yes, I'll wait 'til you drink both.
Why yes thank you, I'll have one. After all it's last call.
Why not? I hate doing my job sober.
You're not going to finish that.
I'm waiting for happy hour to end.
Thanks, but I'm working.
No thanks - when I drink and scythe, they occasionally arrive alive.
Cheer up, there’s another election in 2020.
No thanks. Beer goes right through me.
Better make that ‘to go,’ bud.
Thanks, but it just goes right through me.
This stuff will be the death of me, but cheers anyway friend!
One more before I go?
Tough day at work too?
C'mon Death, live a little.
Looks like I won’t have to pay my tab today, so might as well
Here's to looking at death straight in the eye!
Happy Hour isn't the only thing about to end.
To the future!
Last round is on me.
Last call...indeed.
Cheer up. The GOP is eliminating Obamacare.
Here's to you, Ghost of Christmas future!
Not while I'm in uniform, but thanks anyway.
Sorry I don't drink on the job
Come on. It won't kill you.
Are you familiar with the phrase: 'dead drunk?'
Thanks no, but can you give me a ride home?
Thanks, but you're going need that more than I do.
Have a drink buddy, it's not like it will kill you
Have a drink, it won't kill you.
Toast? ...I'm not toast, you're toast.
Thanks, but I don't drink on the job.
Sure, we share a couple of drinks, some laughs, but believe me, it's not going to end well.
You're welcome, sir. Now, do you remember saying you were dying for a drink?
Here's mud in your eye-socket!
Is it gluten-free?
Now God can just swipe left, and I'm out of a job.
Are you celebrating Trump too?
C'mon, I voted for your guy.
Cheers! Looks like a great year for you Republicans!
What doesn't kill you....oh wait
Thanks pal, you're a real life saver!
Drink too much, and tomorrow morning's gonna be hell.
Thanks, but I'm driving.
You go ahead. I'll wait.
I can't. GOP's got me working overtime.
Thanks, but... you need it more than I do.
Geez, buddy, looks like you could use a drink!
Live a little. You only die once!
Thanks, but that’s not the bier I was talking about.
Thank you, I'm as dry as a bone.
It won't change my mind.
Where have you been all my life?
I'm dying to have a drink with you, buddy.
You've never heard of Happy Hour?
Thanks, I have something for you too.
You're thinking of my father, Time.
How 'bout one more for the road...
Here's to a long and happy life!
That's not what I meant by 'It's your turn'.
Busy year, huh?
No disrespect, but it's happy hour.
Here -- looks like I don't have time for both.
Yes, it’s really me but you have nothing to worry about. I work for the Department of Health and Human Services now.
Thanks, but I'm not allowed to drink on the job.
To your health!
Ok, I heard ya, Mister Last Call
Triple IPA from Vermont, it's to die for.
No thanks, I already drank myself to death.
Just so you know, I'm about to bring a whole new meaning to "Last Call."
Sorry, I'm on the job. And when I mess up, people live.
Hey Buddy, how about a cold one?
No thanks ... I don't drown sorrows.
Thanks for the beer, this new job is killing me.
You'll need one for the road
Ah, come on, one more won't kill you!
No thanks. I don't drink when I'm working.
Here you go,Pal. Maybe this will take the edge off.
Thanks, I’d kill for a beer.
C'mon, it's Happy Hour.
Yea, okay. But we still have to leave together
I guess when they said "last call" they really meant it.
If you had a chest this would put some hair on it.
Sorry, I'm working.
Okay, one more than I really have to kill you.
Cheer up. If they wipe out cancer, another disease will come along.
To good health!? Guess again pal.
Thanks, but I need something stiffer after the day I've had.
Go ahead, drink 'em both. It's last call, for you.
That damn cardiologist saved another one, huh. Here ya go, Grimmy. First round is on me.
Mondays, am I right?
If I were you, I'd drink both!
I usually wait till last call
One more before closing?
Thanks, but I prefer a Bloody Mary.
Here's to one last round for the road.
You Uber guys are everywhere!
Here ya go, pal. I'm driving.
This craft beer is to die for.
Steve Bannon, you look like you could use a drink.
I'm really not supposed to drink with the customers.
I'd share but it looks like I'm not driving tonight.
Drink up american, it's your last happy hour.
Hey buddy, have a beer. Just one won’t kill ya!
You win. Less filling. Now let’s go.
It's a quarter to three. Now why do you think there's no one else here except you and me?
I wish I could bring an early end to 2017, too.
I'm guessing you've probably never had an IPA?
Have one on me! I hear it’s last call.
I'd love one--work was hell today.
I'll buy you a round if you don't mind stopping by the White House.
To your health, old buddy.
The Gravediggers' Union salutes you, Sir.
No thanks, I stick to pale ales.
Why not? I've got time to kill."
Thanks, but they go right through me.
Thanks Bannon
Yes, it's actually quite similar to Margaritaville!
Sure. What the hell. You only have time to drink one anyway.
No thanks. I'll just go wait in the car.
Cold and stiff, just as you like 'em.
I don't have time for a drink, and neither do you.
Very tempting, but I'm on the clock.
Hey gorgeous!
To Death! Let us part.
No thanks. Alcohol goes right through me.
Thanks, but no. I'm the designated driver.
No thanks, you're driving
Here's to your health.
Hey! I bet you'd like a cold one.
Let's drink to my health!
You do know happy hour ends at ends at 7, right?
No, I insist. Last call's on me.
Thanks, I could kill for a beer right now.
Feel like killing a beer or two, mister?
Thanks, but I’ve already had so much, that could be the death of me.
Have a beer, buddy...you look like death warmed over.
Come on...one drink won't kill you.
'A better place,' you say? I guess we'll see, but this place sets the bar pretty high.
I guess I won't be driving, so I'll have two.
No, my friend, Happy Hour it isn't.
Take off your coat, honey, put down your mop, and let's get acquainted.
I guess this really is “last call”!
One for the roadkill.
That wasn't the happy hour bell, Bob.
Nah keep it, beer just goes right through me.
'It's yours now, the guy sitting here just dissapeared"
Aw, c'mon, one beer won't kill ya.
It's a little yeasty, but it won't kill you.
Just one...I'm reaping tonight...and by the way...
Here ya go buddy. Nobody's happy ALL the time.
Why so grim? This one's on me.
Bold move Jimmie, but I'm not here for you!
Not the "cold one" I was talking about.
My place or yours?
Yea, I always stick around for last call
Someone said last call??
Drink up.....Last call!
No, thanks. You’re driving tonight.
None for me, thanks, that stuff'll kill you.
You look different from your profile photo.
Just one, then we gotta go
You're a scythe for sore eyes, too, pal.
Alright, just the one. Then I really must take you to this after-hours place.
You keep it. It’s almost last call.
Sure, why not? Call me the ghost of Christmas Pabst.
Ironically, you missed last call. But I got you.
No, thanks. I’m your designated scyther.
Thanks, but my way is faster.
Don't beer the reaper.
Oh c'mon. It can wait..
That's a nice gesture, but it won't postpone the inevitable.
C’mon. It ain’t gonna kill ya.
I'm a spirits man myself
To the future!
We'll need to get those to go.
Long day?
Come on, one more won't kill us
Come on, things can't be that grim.
It’d take more than a beer
No thanks, I'm sorta your designated driver.
One more for the road?
See...Not so grim.
Oh no, beer goes right through me
C'mon brother - like it's gonna kill you to have a drink ...
I said, ‘D.O.A.,’ not ‘I.P.A.’
No one's ever offered...
Us Giants fans got to stick together
Here, try not to be so Grim.
Which Network you headed to next ?
It's a quarter to three, there's no one in the place, except you and me. . .
I could really use one of those after the eternity I've had.
No thanks. It just runs right through me.
'Lchaim', to life'.
Thanks. I’ll have both when we’re through here.
I'll tell you, it's a real change of pace having men in Hollywood kill their own careers for once.
Last call you say?
If you,ve got the time, I've got the bier.
I can't. I'm working.
I think right now you need that more than me...
Thanks! I'm hoping 2018 is even better.
I might as well. I'll have to pay your tab anyways.
C'mon, lighten up.
Hey, can you make it two? Taxes will be here in a minute.
Come on, have a beer. It won't kill ya.
Cheers, I guess I won't have to pay off my tab!
The boss says texting is more efficient.
I ordered two. The bartender told me it would be last call.
Oh come on, have another drink. It won't kill ya.
Here's to tomorrow!
Buddy, my name’s not ‘Shweety’, and I promise you don’t want to come home with me.
Hey pal have a beer. You look like death warmed over.
I really shouldn't, I'm on the clock.
This winter ale is to die for.
Let's drink! To Trump care!
No, thanks, I'm waiting for some health nut.
I'm not sure which team is yours, but I hope they win.
I can't tonight, I'm the designated scyther.
It'll take the edge off.
Does this mean Happy Hour is over?
Well aren't you a scythe for sore eyes.
Norm!!!!
You must be dying for a beer.
C'mon...just a couple more and I'll drive you home.
You bet it’s frustrating. They’re so absorbed in their smartphones, it’s like I’m not even there!
I killed it today.
Okay, but that's the last one.
Ordering a second round, now that I see I will not be picking up the tab.
Keep it, you're gonna want to forget this.
Thanks, but I prefer something dark with a nice bitter finish.
Hey, my Guardian Angel is running late. Want a beer?
No thanks- that stuff just goes right through me
He doesn't get here 'til 10. Would you like a beer while you wait?
Sure, but let's not drink to your health.
Do I look dehydrated?
No thanks, I prefer a bier.
Come on, have one! It won't kill you!
To life, indeed.
C'mon buddy, get a life!
Here you go, buddy. You kinda look like death warmed over.
No thank you. I don't drink when I'm working.
Kinda gives new meaning to "one for the road," now doesn't it.
No thanks, we're not staying long.
Is it organic?
OK. But just one more - then we really gotta go!
Hey pal have a beer. You look like death warmed over.
Hammered before sickle!
No thanks, draft beer goes right through me.
No, you idiot, I said it's time for a "bier."
Nice try.
It's really not MY health we should be toasting.
There's closing time, and there's Closing Time.
No thanks. I'm tonight's designated driver.
Are you sure? It’s last call.
I'm waiting until you get behind the wheel.
Let’s have one more before we go.
How about a cold one?
Thanks, but I can't really show you Christmas Future
This IPA is to die for!
I never drink when I am on the job.
I promise, it's gluten free.
You look like you could use this more than me.
Okay, one for the road to Hell.
No thank you, that stuff goes right through me.
Drink up! I'm your designated driver.
You looked younger in your pictures.
Hey pal, you here on business or pleasure?
Better drink up, pal. It's last call.
Thanks for the offer, but you're still going to hell.
I must say, sir, your kind offer makes my purpose for being here a bit more difficult.
It’s closing time, dude.
I'll have to pass. I cut wheat, i don't drink it. Gluten can kill ya.
I can't. I'm your designated driver. Not that you'll survive the ride home either way but it's the principle of the thing.
You are accepting this quite gracefully.
Oh no--that stuff will kill you.
Here's to the repeal of the Death Tax.
Nah, it’s just gonna go right through me.
No, no. I said, "You're toast".
Sure. One last stout before I check you out?
I must have the wrong bar. This place is already dead.
Oh...why not?! I actually have a little time to kill...
Here's to you being dead. It's been a hellish year for the rest of us.
No thanks, you go ahead. After all, it is last call.
Come on, man, one drink won't kill you.
Do you have any idea how tired I am of hearing, "How's 'bout one more for the road?"?
No thanks-- I'm trying to cut down.
No thanks, that stuff'll kill you.
Good thing dead men tell no tales. My wife would kill me if she knew I was here.
You might as well drink both.
Another guy offered me ‘White House Chief Strategist.’
My friend, that'll buy you a day.
Thanks, but I need to stay sharp.
Here's to the last last call.
Your generosity will be the death of me.
Why so grim?!
One of us will have a good year.
' Last call' ? Well, if you insist.
Join me for a bier?
Sure, why not drink to your health?
I'm afraid we're cutting you off
Why don’t you try living for a change?
You're too late but you can have his beer if you want.
Don’t think buying me a drink means I won’t leave with you.
No no I can’t... I’m waiting for a Donald Trump
No thanks. Happy hour really isn't my thing.
Let me buy you a beer. Ive been dying to meet you.
Like I always say, "there are no strangers, only friends I haven't met yet."
One last pint before we go???
Trust me. You need it more than I do.
You just missed 'last call', buddy.
Now THAT'S a 'last call'!
Here's hoping it's Halloween.
I am supposed to take you with me at 5, but sure, why not, its not 5 o'clock somewhere.
“Bottoms up?” I’ll pass that along to your undertaker.
You look like I feel.
You look like you could use a cold one.
That's the spirit!
What do you mean, "last call"? It's only 10:00!?
Hey, live a little!
I never drink on the job. Besides, you need it more than I do.
Yes, please! That stuff will kill you!
Thanks, but I don't drink when I'm working.
Well, if we're off to the hot place, let's share a cold one first!
Here! Wipe that grim off your face.
The Fire-and-Brim-Stone IPA is a little hoppy, but I think you'll like it.
Sure, I'll have one more. What could it hurt?
Ask not for whom the beer tolls, it tolls for thee.
So what line of work are you in?
My pleasure. Drive careful, hear?
Thanks, but I don't drink and scythe.
You look like death, have a drink!
Cheers to the Reaper of hops, barley and souls.
Trust me, this one won't kill you.
I'd kill for a drink.
Congratulations on your appointment as the new Secretary of Defense.
I'll pass, thank you. I have no stomach for beer...no stomach at all.
Drink up! I hear the death tax got axed.
I never drink on the job, but leave it there my shift's almost over.
Maybe in a minute. My shift is just about over.
Normally I don’t feel like death until the next morning.
Last one? If you say so.
"No thanks, I'm looking for a bier".
I would but I'm gluten free.
Go for it. What is chugging two beers going to do, kill you?
No, I don't want to take your last one!
Here's to hoping you're wearing a costume and not a uniform.
When the barkeep shouts, 'Last call!' I better take him more seriously.
No, thank you. I'm on duty now.
Naw, beer just goes right through me.
Man, I'd not kill for a beer!
That's the spirit!
Hey Slim, let’s drink to your health.
I suppose one beer wouldn't kill me.
Here’s to the economy!
Is that light beer?
You the socially responsible guy who called for Uber?
Not for me. I’m the designated scyther.
This beer is to die for!
Nah...One more'll kill me.
Why not? I can always get an Uber.
I don't want to sound grim, but I prefer to drink alone.
Why not? It won't kill me.
Thanks, but not when I'm working. Did you happen to notice your ex in the parking lot?
Nope, and I don't pay taxes, either.
Well Jasper, when I say "Time Gentlemen" it has a slightly different meaning.
This’ll raise your spirits.
It's really dark. You'll like it.
Whatever happened to "Death be not proud"? Lemme buy you a drink!
That stuff goes right through me.
No thanks, buddy, that stuff will kill you...
Yeah, you don't recognize me do you?
Sure, what the heck -- the wife keeps telling me to be less grim.
Let's skip the first part, and just toast to taxes.
No drinking when I'm on the job.
I said I'm buyin', not dyin'
Thanks. Next bier's on me.
No thanks, I'd rather die
The way I figure, it sure beats dying alone.
Hey fella, why so grim?
Look, man. Just because you're feeling grim that doesn't make us brothers.
So, one drink won’t kill you.
Ah, what the hell.
Here . . . you look like you need this more than I do.
Have a seat, I've been waiting for you.
...and another just like it if you take her damn dog too.
Is it a frosted mug?
And Happy Last Year to you!
Relax, it's the bartender's job to announce last call.
You DO realize this is not a Halloween costume, right?
Have one! Don't be a killjoy.
Here's to 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
Flirting with Death.
It’s just that my wife is cheating. And if anything happens to the guy, she’ll know it was me.
You're late. Beer?
C'mon buddy, get a life!
Thanks. I'm in the mood for a cold one.
Let's drink to a swift end to 2017!
Did you hear the one about the guy who dropped dead at last call?
stick around, happy hour's a killer here
Better not. I don't want to lose my edge.
This ones one me, that was my ex wife you killed last week.
No, thanks. That'll go right through me.
Thanks, but a toast to good health would be a conflict of interest.
OK thanks, but it's still last call for you.
So, the Grim Reaper walks into a bar...
My buddy was right. This craft beer is to die for.
Thanks for the offer, but it just goes straight through me.
What's the rush? We've got all night.
Thanks but beer just goes right through me.
Oh, thanks! Let's drink to your health!
And I would be delighted to buy you another round tomorrow evening.
Your date stood you up, too?
Oh, go ahead. Loosen up! You always look so grim!
Look at me, of course I can't hold my liquor.
We're the last two...you know what that means!?!
Better drink up. It's your last call.
I’m actually working right now... Oh, whatever - I suppose one drink won’t kill me.
No thanks! I'll just wait 'til you're FINISHED!
Come on, one more won't kill us
No thanks, that stuff just runs right thru me.
No, I don't drink and scythe.
Come on, one ain't gonna kill you!
Cut the wheat myself.
Fraternizing with clients is usually frowned upon but if you say it’s Belgian ...
Have a beer. I’m not ready yet
Sorry, beer goes right through me.
Do I look thirsty?
A younger person took my job too.
No, I really shouldn't. I'm on the job.
"A toast to being toast".
Come, a beer won't kill you.
This will help you forget.
To fatal liver disease!
You mean to tell me I made it through without a sexual harassment accusation?
I'd be glad to....I have few minutes to kill anyway.
Long day?
Told you, you should have stuck with cigarette s
One beer gonna kill yah?
No thanks, I’m not here for the beer.
Thanks. But that stuff will kill you. Believe me.
Come on, have one. I'm running a tab.
Sure buddy, I'd be HAPPY to drive you home.
And here's to grim life.
Hey buddy, what do you say we drink to long life?
Go ahead It's not gonna kill ya
Norm!!!!
You really shouldn't have.
A final one for the road
Hey buddy, have I ever told you about my wife.
Let's toast your new position as Ambassador to North Korea !
I was expecting Jesus, but what the hell.
So...I guess this is last call.
So this is really last call.
Yeah, I've done lawn work too.
No thanks, they go right through me.
Ladies night was better under Obama
Well, my shift starts in 10 minutes, but I guess my passengers can wait.
I said Grim Reaper, not gimmebeer
You look like death warmed over, here have one!
Nah, that stuff goes right through me.
No, I haven't heard the one about the unsuspecting drunk.
Oh come on, live a little.
Thanks, but I never mix business with pleasure.
How about some spirits?
I hope you're not hitting on me, because I'm not that kind of ghoul.
Extra dark, the way you like it.
Jesus! You better have one of these; you look like death warmed over.
How many virgins?
L'chaim, to life! Eh, never mind. I'll drink it myself.
Nice to see you; this place is dead.
Sigh... I’ve never worked this much overtime.
Better have one with me now. Business will be booming when they end Obamacare.
How about I give you a pint of Guinness and you give me an extra year?
No thanks, I’m driving. The Highway to Hell is killer this time of year.
That might buy you five minutes tops.
Here, looks like today's been a real killer.
Well, yes, I do love cold biers!
no thanks- I'm dead tired today
I really shouldn't, but since you're driving me home...
You must be the currently live entertainment.
It's the last call.
Why not. You still have 50 minutes left on the parking meter.
Here Bro, you season workers deserve it the most!
Don’t worry. I only cut down those who use the word ‘artisanal.’
No thanks. Alcohol goes right through me.
These poor seasonal employees - they show up every November but then seem to just melt away by January...
Tough day at the office, am I right.
You can't hold any liquor? - Show me!
Here is to certainty
I'm afraid this isn't a social call.
Here, I heard you got fired by Trump.
I've been to hell and back today
One for the road paved with good intentions? Why not!
Here's to what ales ya.
Have one on me. They don't serve anything on that river boat.
Thanks, but I can't...it goes right through me.
C'mon, just one, it's not going to kill you.
Maybe you misunderstood. Only the Death TAX is cancelled.
No thanks, believe me that stuff will kill you.
Come on, one of these won’t kill you!
Did you see; they elimuinated the estate tax.
No thanks, my Friend. Beer goes right through me these days.
Drink up. We'll take an Uber.
No, you have that, you're driving.
Here, pal. Have a cool one while you're waiting.
You go ahead, I'm still working.
Before we go, here's one for the road.
Here ya go. My job sucks too.
I better not. Beer goes right through me.
No thanks, I'm reaping......
Got time to kill a beer?
Join you? Join me!
Here, have one on me. You look dry as a bone!
It won't kill you to have just one.
Thanks - your last one's on me.
Take my wife, please.
Why so grim? Have a beer.
No thanks, I'm your designated driver tonight.
You had a great run as "scariest of all time," but none of us saw this administration coming.
I am so parched, I'll give you two weeks for that beer.
No thanks, I'm working.
Thanks, but YOU'RE the one dying of thirst.
Have a drink – it won’t kill ya!
Cheer up, Death - it's happy hour!
It's nice to have some company, this place is usually dead after midnight.
You look like death, this one is on me.
Let's toast to my health in 2018
Happy hour is pretty dead around here.
Here you go mate. This'll reap your grimness.
Another stiff cold one?
No thanks, I'll wait for last call.
...or did you mean BIER?
C'mon. One drink won't kill me.
Bitter Ale? How did you know?
C'mon, one more ain't gonna kill YOU!
Never drink and scythe!
I never go anywhere until I've had a few.
No thanks, I'm on the clock. But enjoy your last drink.
i’m off gluten. that stuff goes straight through me.
Let me say it in terms you may understand: you're shut off.
No thanks. I prefer something darker.
No thanks, I just joined Afterlife Anonymous.
Thanks, but I said “Your time is up,” not “Bottoms up.”
Have a Brew Mr. Bannon
You're saying I won't have to pay for another drink in my life? Cheers to that!
It was still a safer bet than drinking with Harvey Weinstein.
I'd kill for a cold beer.
OK, OK I get it. Last call.
Buy you a bier?
Go on. What have you got to lose?
Here, drink this slowly and I'll go grab a mop for you.
Never had Pumpkin Spice? It's to die for.
You look thirsty
Hey, I see you here all the time. It's about time I buy you a beer!
So who told you I've got a big job at the White House?
Thanks, but I'll need a mop.
Come on, one more is not gonna kill ya
Sorry... I’m on duty.
Hashtag, YOLO!
You might as well join me while you wait. Cheers!
Hey! Steve Bannon, right? Wanna beer?
C'mon...one more won't kill ya!
One for the road? Hope it's not the one paved with good intentions.
Sure, why not? Drinking and driving is how I got this job in the first place.
I guess we have time for one more before we go.
No thanks. . . I got a long night ahead of me. What's your blood type?
Don't be so grim, Reaper.
No thanks, I'm still working
Here, when you're done, then we'll go.
If that’s gluten free beer I’ll kill you now...
The last one’s on me.
Not for me. I'm driving.
Sorry, I'm not allowed to drink on the job.
Take this, Mac. You look like death warmed over.
Mr Reaper- Last call-one for the road!
Go on , have a beer . After all you only live once !
Thanks but not thanks. I have a strict policy of not drinking while on the job.
Care for a beer while you wait?
Well, guess i won't be needing this one
Oh no, thanks, I'm a bit of a brew snob. I prefer mine dark and bitter.
To Life! To Life! L'chayim!
Sorry, man. I'm on the job.
Thanks, but I never drink when I’m working.
Thanks for the beer, stranger! No, I don't have a designated driver. Why do you ask?
C'mon buddy, one beer won't kill ya!
Don't let the repeal of the death tax get you down!
Well, here you are, where everybody knows your name.
Come on over and join me. Business hasn't been the same since they banned smoking.
No thanks pal, that stuff will just run right through me.
Here's to you friend, its nice to have company at the bar at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday. So, what do you do for a living?
Oh come on, live a little.
I’m just killing time.
No it's not a Halloween costume, but I'll take the beer.
Thanks, I am dying of thirst.
Thanks, but I’m still on the clock.
I’m not here for 2-for-1 happy hour. I’m here BECAUSE of 2-for l happy hour.
'Come on- even you need a holiday".
Thanks, but no. My aim is lousy when I drink.
Take my wife, please.
Concerned for his health, Bill's therapist recommended he stop drinking alone.
Cheers, or maybe not.
I'd love to, but my Uber will be here in a minute.
How about a little hair of the dog? You look like death.
Lets drink to a long life.
Thanks, no. I’m incontinent.
Come on. One beer ain't gonna kill ya.
No thanks...I'm working tonight.
Why so grim, buddy? Pint's on me.
Never drink and scythe!
Thanks, pal, but I never drink when I’m about to start the graveyard shift.
Awe, come on. One won’t kill you.
Seriously? I'm getting White Russians at all of Trump's places.
You can drink it. It's hot where we're going.
Pale Ale?
Thanks, but I'm on the clock.
No thanks. That stuff just seems to run right through me.
No man. I'm telling you, this isn't happy hour.
No, it wouldn't kill me to have a beer.
All I’m saying is you wouldn’t see anyone buying the taxman a beer.
Better not. I'm the designated reaper.
I’m going to pass. Beer goes right through me.
I’m not falling for that again.
Hey pal, do you have any advice for a guy in a dead-end job?
I can’t drink on the job.
Thanks, buddy. Next time I won't forget to bring my ID.
I usually don't drink when I am working.
No thanks, I hear it cuts down on your life expectancy.
The work is a bit depressing but I like the job security.
I'm here for YOU too, buddy!
When I said "last call" it wasn't for alcohol.
Unfortunately I meant another kind of last call.
Are you coming with me to the after party?
It’s closing time.
I will be your designated driver, no problem.
You’re dead, drunk.
No, thanks. I'm on call.
Thanks, but I'm still reaping.
No thanks, man, but you go ahead-- YOLO.
I would, but I'm working. Are you Craig?
One more for eternity?
I'm actually looking for a bloody Mary. Have you seen her?
No thanks, I'm a mean drunk.
One more won't kill me.
I always have time to kill.
What were the odds we'd be fraternity brothers.
No thanks. I’ve got another mass shooting tonight.
Better not, I can be a mean drunk.
Til death do us part.
OK, but then that's really it.
Have a cold one buddy, you look like death.
Have a drink, I've been dying for some company.
Nice try Steve but I am still not going to vote for the GOP.
No, thanks. I actually have a bier for you.
Here, buddy. You look seriously dehydrated.
A non-alcoholic beer?! ...... You're dead to me!
No, thanks. I don't drink and scythe.
Hey man, one for the road ok.
I'll be with you in a minute.
A toast. To the good life.
M'name's Taxes. Care for a brewski?
Care to join? My wife will kill me if I have another.
Oh no - life has come for me.
Here Buddy, won't you join me? I'm drinking like there's no tomorrow.
My last one for the day, pal. Join me?
You still haunting this place?
Thanks, but I’m gluten free.
Looks like it’s Reaper Time!
I hear the draft beer here is to die for...
A toast, to dying in your sleep.
You look like death warmed over. Its on me.
What are we celebrating?
No thanks-- I'm trying to cut down.
Perhaps you've heard of 'last call?'
Here's for being such a good listener.
No thanks, I'm working.
Thanks but no thanks. Turns out it's a bit tricky opening my fly with this damned blade thingy.
Here's to America.
Thanks, but I wouldn't be caught DEAD drinking light beer...
Waiting for my confirmation hearing.
Here. 2017 felt like a century to me too.
Ok, maybe just one but you'll need to go ahead and clear your tab.
I've been subpoenaed too.
Come on dude, a beer ain't gonna kill you.
C’mon, its not like we’re going to need a designated driver.
What do you mean “last call”?
Thanks, but Black Nail or Death in The Afternoon is more my style.
I have a better idea. Let's kill time.
No, thanks - I'm gluten-sensitive.
Charming! A toast to me before you're toast.
Hopefully after a few more of these you'll start looking better.
I really shouldn't drink on the job.
Very nice of you. I'll get the next one.
In that case... here's one for the road!
Here's to taxes!
Buy me a drink and I think you'll find I'm not such a grim reaper after all.
Alright I just have one but then we have to go.
Before I accept, you do realize there won't be a next round for me to get?
Great job you did on the tax cut!
It’s a light beer for the ‘trim reaper’.
Thanks but that’s not strong enough for the millenium I’ve had.
Why, thank you! It's tricky making new friends in this job.
What should we toast to? Taxes?
Go ahead, pal (hic) kill it!
Who do you have to kill to get a drink around here?
A few more and things won't seem so grim!
There's more where this came from if you say you never saw me!
Have one on me buddy. Lighten up... You look like you've seen a ghost.
No thanks, I’m on the clock.
I'm not ready! Have a cool one on me.
Pick-me-up?
Since you're here, what do you say we run up the tab?
OK, suit yourself, but I do have time to drink both, don't I?
I'll gladly accept, thank you. However, I'm afraid I can't drink to your health.
C'mon one beer won't kill ya...right?
While you're waiting for your friend, have a drink on me!
No thanks. I'm just waiting until happy hour is over.
Cold One, funny you should ask.
What's your poison?
I suppose it wont kill me.
The bartender disappeared. Help yourself.
Lets get nuts!
Have a beer.It will liven things up.
How about helping me kill this first?
Ballsy.
No, thanks. I never drink on the job.
Take me before the 2018 mid-terms please!!
Have a drink. I don’t know what’s going to happen either.
May we live forever!
I sure hope today is Halloween.
The last guy wanted to play chess.
I've gotten drunk with worse than you.
Here's looking through you, buddy.
Jeez man, you look like death. Have a drink.
Sorry, pal, I'm giving it up. No one's scared of the Happy Hour Reaper.
Beer today; gone tomorrow.
I hate to tell you this but it's Happy Hour.
Sorry - don't have the stomach for it.
C'mon, buddy, it won't kill you.
. . . another cold one, bartender.
Here's looking at you - momentarily.
Why don’t I just be the designated driver?
It's Miller's time.
Okay, okay, one more, but after that, you're done.
You'll need that where we're going.
It really is last call
Can't, I'm on a juice cleanse.
Death be not proud. Have a beer.
'To going gently into that good night'--I'll drink to that!
Steve Bannon! I never forget a face.
Come on over. I'm in the acceptance stage.
No, no, I wouldn't want to take your last beer.
This is the life!
Drink up. I'm trying to be more of a Kind Reaper.
Would it kill ya to have a drink with me?
Here's looking at what's left of you kid '
Well then, Let's drink to Liberty!
Aw c'mon, one won't kill ya!
L'chaim! Don’t be so grim.
I'd love to, but my wife would kill me.
This one’s on me. Next round and for eternal damnation’s on you.
No, Thank you. 'Last Call' has a whole different meaning for me.
You ready? I already got one for the road.
sure one drink won't kill me.
Yeah, yeah, I know, the end is near… Blah, blah, blah… That’s why I ordered two of these when I heard the last call…
Sorry. I can’t drink and collect.
No thanks, you are still coming with me!
I'm here to de-liver.
Oh, come on; one beer won't kill ya!
One drink won't kill you
Nice job playing Steve Bannon on TV.
Okay... but these are your last two.
No, but thanks, I don't drink on the job. You drink them both and enjoy! I'll wait till you finish.
Hey buddy, do you want to help me kill this beer?
You only live once, am I right?
Is your name Miller by chance?
November 8, 2016: "Sometimes I think I should just hang up the scythe. What do you say we get hammered and sickled?"
I don't think you quite understand what getting rid of the Death Tax means.
Cheers", Everybody knows your name.
Here's mud in yer eyehole.
Thanks pal, dare I say 'Cheers'?
care to join me for last call?
Sorry, I can't. It takes the edge off.
Thanks for the offer, but I never drink on the job or take someone's last beer.
Thanks, but I try not to mix business with pleasure.
Okay, one more drink then I really have to kill you.
No, no...that's fine. You enjoy them both, Gary.
None for me. One of us has to get you home safely.
Nah, thanks, I haven't got the stomach for it.
I'd love one, but it always goes right through me.
No thanks, I never drink while I'm on the job.
Hey friend, last call.
Looks like you could use a pick-me-up
Come on – one more won’t kill you!
I'd love to but I have to go, this job is killing me.
No thanks, I'll have a "Dark and Stormy."
No thanks, you have it. It's closing time.
Typically, I get both.
Thanks, Jim. I really needed a drink. I feel like death warmed over.
"What the hell, why not, I've got a few days left to kill"!
I'm just taking it really hard. He was a really swell bartender.
The bartender could not stop for death but he kindly stopped for me
You look like you had a tough day. Have one on me.
No thanks, I don't drink and you don't have the time.
Name your poison.
I don't mean to be presumptuous, but I think I see a fellow DeadHead -right?
I never drink and reap
This one's on me buddy! You look like death just walked in.
Sorry, that stuff goes right through me
I'd rather have you join me.
``I just lowered my cable bill by forty dollars. Not bad, huh?''
I'll wait.
Cheers! You sure know how to clear out a bar.
Alright, but just one before we hit the road.
Yeah, I'm dead serious - it's on me.
What the hell, why not?
What'd you say your name was again?
Come for the drinks, stay for the company.
Did someone say last call?
C'mon, have a drink! You'll live longer... and me, too.
A bier! I said I need a BIER!!!
You look like you need a bier.
Thanks, I don’t think he’s going to show either.
Well, I always say,"live and let live, eh?"
No, thank you. I don't drink on the job.
One for the road?
Thanks, I'm good. You should finish both then try to drive home.
One for the road paved with good intentions?
Your name is Grim what?
Knock, knock.
Okay , okay . I get it . It's closing time .
Actually if you could drink both... I'm already behind schedule
Okay, okay. One more for the road to hell.
To last calls?
No thanks, not while I'm working.
Why not, after all, it's last call for both of us.
"Thanks, but I'm more of a dark man myself".
I'm getting tired of feeling like the bad guy all the time
No thanks. If my wife finds out, I'm dead.
Cheers to a long and fulfilling life.
Come on, have one. A night off won't kill you.
Might as well tie one on first.
Do me a favor and drink them both--really fast.
Looks as if I’m not paying the tab so have one on me.
No thanks pal - I'm on duty.
Come on, one beer won't kill ya...
You might need a mop with this.
No thanks, I've been in recovery for the last 5,000 years or so.
No thanks -- it's dead in here.
Naw. Just hold my beer. The rapture is gonna take some time.
Have a beer, mate. You look like death.
No thanks; I don't get much from beer. It passes right through me.
Don't worry about it. People mistake me for a Trump supporter all the time.
Your happy hour has come.
Tough day? I hear you are working on the Republican tax bill . Here you go. This one's on me
Honey, the Republicans have sent over their tax bill for us to review
How's your day going so far?
I've been waiting for you to show up!
Sorry, the guy across the street wouldn't serve me 'cause of some "deeply-held religious belief"
Sorry, bud. I can't. The GOP Tax Plan kicks 13 million Americans off their healthcare.
You know that shit'll kill you right?
Here pal, you look like you're dying of thirst.
This one is on me... we Trump supporters need to stick together!
No thanks...I'm more of an 'unhappy' hour guy.
Hey buddy here you go. Are you here on business or pleasure?
What do you mean “today’s the day”? Yesterday you told me to “eat drink and be merry”.
Thanks pal, but I've got a deadline staring me in the face.
Hey, fella, join me. It's happy hour!
You want Jack's beer? He took off when you came through the door.
Thanks, buddy! I guess one more won't kill me.
Are you sure you want me to "come and get it"?
Have a beer and we can talk about the future.
Shame about the bartender. Free beer?
Making your way in the world today takes everything you’ve got, maybe I can interest you in picking out a plot?
You’re the friendliest guy I’ve seen in D.C. all week.
Sorry, no can do. I'm on duty tonight. What did you say your name was, again?
‘Bottom’s up’ is about to have a completely different meaning.
I never drink on the job.
No thanks . . . I already have a bier.
Sorry, I'm the designated driver tonight.
No thanks, craft beer is worse than death.
I'll trade you one beer for one less day in Trump's America.
Well I'll be damned!!
Hey the guy you’re looking for just went home. Have one for the road.
Can't...last one went right through me.
Yes, please! It's scary out there...
C'mon, man. The time is nigh somewhere.
No thanks, pal. I gotta cut you off.
Ask if you can get a couple of go-cups.
Careful, this stuff goes right through you.
Do I want a cold one? You’re killing me!
Okay, but just one.
Thanks, but I've been on the wagon for 6 thousand years.
Have one! What's the worst that could happen?
Thanks, but do you mind if we pick another toast than “L'chaim”?
Is this last call?
You’re just in time, they’re about to repeal my healthcare!
Come on, it will take the edge off.
You look so grim, here have a drink.
We can sleep when we are dead.
Com on one drink won't kill ya.
Here, have a cold one... you look like death
Thanks but that stuff goes right through me.
Binge drinking will be the me of you.
Yes Hell did freeze over when the Astros won the World Series and I am looking for new lodgings.
You’ve been to hell and back- this ones on me!
No thanks. I don't have a stomach for it.
C'mon...one more won't kill ya!
No thanks. You know that stuff will kill you.
I'll bet you both your beers I can guess the day you'll die." "You're on!
Based on your complexion you probably prefer an IPA.
You look like you've got some demons, Buddy.
Don't you think it's a bit late to toast my health?
Here's to dead end jobs!
Thanks buddy for the beer. I was dying for another one. So... what line of work are you in to?
Well since you're here, I won't have to pay for these anyway
Thanks, but I'm only here for a minute. Is the bartender around?
Thanks, I sure could use one. I'm dead on my feet.
Wanna join me?
I'm more of a "glass half empty" guy to be honest.
Once those combines came along, we were forced to consider other careers.
Thanks for the drink. People can be so cold and stiff around me.
Not when I’m reaping!
Would it kill you if we had another drink first?
No thanks - I only take spirits.
Guess what, pal? I'm no longer the most feared figure in this country.
L'Chaim!
C’mon, one won’t kill ya.
Go ahead, it's not going to kill ya
How prophetic ...I get to drink ..."to Death " .
Didn't anyone ever tell you that excessive drinking will be the death of you?
No, thanks, I never drink while I'm on duty.
Thanks, but no. I'm just waiting for your ride home.
Come on...Live a little and have a beer!
No thanks pal, I'm your designated driver
OK, I give you five more minutes.
If I give you this, will you let me finish mine?
I'm driving, but thanks.
I have my own reasons for calling it Happy Hour.
Is death be not too proud for a beer?
I’d kill for a beer right now.
I'll go with you right after I finish my beer --- bartender keep em coming.
Can't. I'm on call 24/7 in the current political environment.
To your good health!
Here's the deal ... you put the sickle away, and I'll buy you a beer.
Sorry. I never drink on the job.
How about one for the road?
No, I don't drink and scythe.
Thanks, pal. I owe ya.
This Beelze-Bud's for you!
Here's to the two party system.
To my health!
Here ya go. Business will pick up January when insurance deductibles haven't been met.
No thank-you, I never drink while I'm working.
Truce?
Trust me, you'd be better off wishing your liver good health!
Didn't expect to see you at happy hour.
It?s OK to mix business with pleasure...
Now that's the way to make a friend for the rest of your life.
Cheers, do you want it with the head or without?
Looks like my ex-wife was right. I am gonna drink myself to death.
I'd normally say 'all things in moderation' but go ahead and drink both.
I guess one, wouldn't kill me.
C’mon, on me, looks like you need a pick me up.
Thanks, I have been feeling a little grim today.
Now that I no longer have to pay the individual mandate, let me buy you a drink.
Let the bargaining begin
Beer? Or, would you rather play a game of chess?
Thanks, but it's not pale enough yet. I'll wait.
Sorry; I don't drink on duty
Here, Buddy, you only live once.
Only one, but right after we're leaving.
Why thank you. As long as you’re driving I believe I will.
Yes, yes. It's a beauty. I use it for reaping, you know.
Something tells me you’ll only have time for one.
What’s a nice ghoul like you doing in a place like this?
No thanks, I don't drink on the job, but you may want to chug yours.
OK, I see it's last call but how about one for the road?
Hey man, who ya lookin' for?
You're a grim reaper...I'm a happy drunk! Join me!
Nah, I have to think about my ghoulish figure.
A cold one! Hell yes.
No thanks, I don't hold my liquor well
Welcome back, Steve! ... So, how was the Washington gig?
Are you the Uber for Steve? My phone is dead.
Slàinte!
Thanks, but I'm behind on my quota this week. You drink them both and drive home.
You're too kind.
What the hell, I just paid my taxes, got nothing left to do anyway.
Charlie you look like death. Tell me all about it.
'Lchaim', to life'.
Bartender, add this to my tab for my new friend!
Nice try, but that's not what I'm here for.
No thanks, beer seems to go right through me.
Take one, the chances of me finishing both are grim.
You look like death warmed over. Have a beer.
One for the road ? Sure. But it's still end of the road for you pal.
Relax, one beer won't kill you.
My pal left cause the place is dead.
No thank-you. I don't drink and scythe.
It's time for the VERY last call.
Cheers to “last call!”
Ah, what the hell, I guess you only live once.
Let me know when I've had enough!
Go ahead, have two for the road, then we're out of here!
Aw c'mon, one won't kill ya!
I never touch that stuff.
Sorry I can't drink that stuff, it just goes right through me.
Trust me, drink as much as you want.
I guess one beer won't kill me.
Let's drink to no more dead end jobs.
Put it on my stab.
Oh,Alright,bud; just one more for the road.
Trump 2020 starting early?
What's a happy hour?
Oh hey, I thought you would be at Mar-a-lago!
Want one? I will keel over if I have another.
Whose health are we drinking to?
You look mighty grim...here, have a beer.
Fine, one more, then you have to go.
Huh. She always said I'd meet my death this way.
Thanks, but I can't drink on duty.
Happy New Year! Oh, wait..
Just have one. It won't kill ya.
C'mon, one more drink won't kill you.
Not now - I'm working.
What’s up bitch
None for me, I actually have to drive you out of here tonight.
I don't usually accept drinks from people I'm not looking for, but what the hell; live a little, right?
Trust me, we’re both going to need this!!
"At least he won't spend more time at the office".
It's not even 6 o'clock, whadaya mean "Last Call"?
So a coronary risk and the Grim Reaper walk into a bar...
Okay, but this is your last drink...
Come on, just have one beer! It won't kill you.
I can't drink your last beer.
Just so you know, I'm not looking for a long term relationship.
I'll be your designated driver tonight...enjoy!
You must play a TON of golf.
You should really take an Uber.
Thanks, I've been feeling a little grim these days.
No worries. It's organic!
There may be some lingering resentment.
One for the road? Hey, thanks, Mac
Another round before we go?
It was only when Henry uttered the words "I'll drink to death" that he realized he had a problem.
No thanks. Been sober forever.
Here's to the last call."
No one likes you? Reaper, please. I voted for Trump.
Grim this.
I've come for your soul....oh...is that a cold beer?
Didn't meet today's quota?
Hey Buddy, how about a beer to take the edge off?
No it's not. The end is beer!
This Bud's for you unless that sickle's for me.
You think you have a horrible boss? Let me tell ya...
My doctor said if I kept drinking I’d meet you!
Can we at least take one for the road?
I don't know, one more might be the death of me...
I just missed getting hit by a bus...this beer's on me.
Pete learned the hard way: Don't beer The Reaper.
Nah, thanks, I had to knock it off: it was beginning to affect my good looks.
Hmm, are you trying to get me drunk?
No thanks man, I'm already dead drunk.
Best drink in town! I'd bet my life on it.
Here, have a beer, I'm not leaving for another 30 minutes.
I'll have to pass. I haven't the stomach for it.
Thanks for making America great again!
No thanks, I'm cutting down.
If you,ve got the time, I've got the bier.
Ahh, why not! It can't get any worse
I can't, but I go off-duty in eight-and-one-half minutes.
It won't kill you to have just one.
Go ahead… One beer won't kill you.
Last orders...
Damn sportsman-like of you!
A light beer won't kill you.
OK, just one. I'm afraid you won't have time for more.
Are you part of the All Lives Matter movement?
Tell my liver "Hi!"
Cheers to reaping what we sow, if you know what I mean
No thanks. I'd have one, if I wasn't working.
I love Blue Ribbon. I'm the ghost of Christmas Pabst.
For a haunting specter of my imminent demise, you're all right, kid.
No, thanks. It messes with my aim.
No, no...I insist. Last round is always on me
No thanks - I'm sure that was your Last Call.
After these and the men's room, I'll be good to go.
Don't tell me—you got automated, too?
I prefer mine with no head
Here’s looking at you.
You know it’s last call, right?
Sure, I'll drink with you, but I don't see this going anywhere you want
When is this "happy hour" over?
First one with alcohol poisoning, wins.
No thanks, You'll be needing that.
Why sit there alone, oh Repear Grim? This beer waits here for you, filled to the brim!
Have a cold one, you look a little grim.
Come on. Let me finish my beer. I hear there isn't even any ice water where I'm going.
Here's to the end of the Estate Tax.
Long day in the field?
First let’s have one for the road.
Thanks, but no. That stuff just goes right through me.
This one's got a head on it.
Want a Beer - never know when it might be your last.
'No thanks, I don't like to drink and scythe.'
Take it...this one is my last
You're welcome. By the way, 'Taxes' will be here shortly.
You do know I'm on duty, don't you?
No thanks. I don't mix business with pleasure.
No thanks. I’m feeling like death todag
Go ahead. Let's drink to the future.
Beer is a great way to kill time but I’m really here for the spirits.
a toast to a long life!
You look like you need a cold one!
Hey Grimsey, buddy! Try this new RIP...uh..uh,..I mean IPA
Thanks anyway, but it's going to take more than a Bud Lite to turn this around.
That stuff goes right through me.
Can I get a ride home? I think you're going my way.
Share a cider, Pale Rider?
Trying to buy some time?
Here's to you, Darth, or whatever your name is.
Little taste of heaven?
You look like death. I think you could use this.
I dunno why I'm buying...you're the one who's racked up all the overtime this year.
C’mon, one drink won’t kill you.
Can you hold a drink?
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, you walk into mine.
Thanks. It's been a busy week. Pledge drive and all.
No thanks...I'm working tonight.
When having a couple beers after work actually can kill you.
No, thanks. Friends don't let friends raft across the River Styx.
Last call .... apparently !!!
Drink up my friend, I'll take you home.
Let's kill these beers and call it a night.
Thanks, but I'll have my own version of 'a cold one' shortly.
You look like you could use a little holiday cheer.
How's life after the West Wing?
How about one for the road, before we go?
Why not? It's almost time for 'last call.'
That's not the head I came for.
Take it, its on me; I don't think I'll be paying my tab.
I really shouldn't. Things get grim when I drink.
I shouldn't. There will be hell to pay if no one gets killed on my drive home.
Feel like a cat playing with the mouse just before... ah what the heck, I'll have a beer.
I find that beer just sort of runs right through me, but sure, why not?
You don't need light beer—you're skin and bones as it is.
Welcome to Harry's beautiful. Love your hoodie. How about joining me for a beer?
Thanks anyway but I'll have to pass...I'm on call.
Tastes Great! Less Killing!
Thanks but I don't drink when I am at work.
Here's a little something to take the edge off.
Cirrhosis, schmirhosis. C'mon and join me. You've been sitting there waiting for 20 years.
Go ahead. It won't kill you!
Looks like I won't have time to drink 'em both!
I am sure you can have one!!!... please don't tell me you're "on duty" ....
Guess no one swiped right for you either?
Thank you. I'll get the next round.
OK, Buddy, no hard feelings?
Last call, buddy.
Alright, Mr. Hoffa, one more beer. But then I have to go to work...
Aw, come ON. You think it's gonna kill you?
Hey pal.. take a time out, you seem dehydrated..
Not now. It's Miller time.
I've been dying for a beer all day.
Are you sure? You look like you could do with one.
Here's one to go
I’m guessing you only show up for last call
Hey Buddy, taxes for the rich may be a thing of the past, but at least we can still drink to death.
I am a regular here; are you sure it is last call?
Thanks, but I'm not here for you. I'm here for the cat.
Here, have a brew-ski. I have to tell you, those shorts just don't go with the rest of that outfit.
Slow down, buddy, you'll drink yourself to death.
None for me, thanks. I'm reaping.
What's it going to do - kill 'ya?
Graveyard shift’s a killer, eh?
Give this a try, it's a killer.
Hah! You think death is cold? This is cold!
Here, cheer up no need to look grim
Don't look so grim buddy, drinks are on me!
Sure buddy - I remember this place before they served craft beer, but all the guys I used to drink with are gone now.
Not now, thanks. Last things first.
Sure, I've got time for a beer, but....
What are you doing here? I thought it was martinis in Samarra at 8 p.m.
Off with your head!
You're the second one I told I was coming home!
Hey fella, looks like you could really use a drink
I guess it’s ‘last call’ for you.
Thanks Jack, but you'll need one for the road.
Cant we talk this over?
Have one on me, mate, you look like Death!
I'm here for souls, not empty calories.
Make sure you drive home tonight, buddy!
One more before closing time?
This beer is to die for!
The Grim Reaper and a Trump supporter walk into a bar...
If you're trying to bribe me, it's working.
Yeah, yeah, "to life". Maybe the wife is right, it's time to lose the scythe, rebrand, target a new demographic.
I prefer a Bloody Mary.
Hi there! For your drive home tonight, I would like to recommend a dark,two-lane mountain highway, only a mile from here, and I'll pick you up there.
Try it. It might loosen you up a bit.
You'll like this: dark, no body.
How long have you been waiting for a drink pal? Here, have this.
Hey, pal. You're being too hard on yourself. Beer is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy.
Have one. It will take the edge off
It won't be a problem; my work is quite sobering
Bottoms up, bud. I got your back.
Oh, come on -- try it. You only live once.
Thanks pal, first kind gesture all day.
Sure, but I have to warn you I'm not the best company.
And they're sharing a drink they call loneliness, but it's better than drinking alone!
Any way I can charm you into taking me before the midterm elections?
Are we going to drink, and then drive?
At least you waited until after Happy Hour.
C'mon. One beer isn't gonna kill you. Har, har, har.
I'd like to but I'm still on the clock.
Well, I suppose one more won't kill me.
Either way, where you are headed next, I know you'll be thirsty.
No thanks, I can't hold my beer.
C'mon! Let's have another round, and you can explain to me again the difference between a sickle and a scythe.
Love to drink, but it goes right through me.
I bet I look like death...
What's the matter? One won't kill you.
Drink till death do us part.
Hey, have a beer and relax...I called a cab.
Don't mind if I do. It's dead out there.
Thanks. I'll take off the head myself.
Here, last call.
I'll buy the last round.
Here! This beer is to die for!
Not much time. I'm still working on Congress and just started the Senate.
Thanks, Joe! Of course you know you're going to down five more of those, try to drive home -- we'll finish business then.
Congrats on passing the inevitable tax act!
Sure, one can't hurt.
Wasn't sure how much time you had..so I ordered for you !
Hey, pal, why so grim?
Good...you've come for the pedophiles. They're all sitting at the corner table.
No thanks. It goes right through me.
Believe me. At this bar, "last call" REALLY means "last call.
I've been expecting you....
No. Let's toast to YOUR health.
These Happy Hour prices are to-die-for
...and the third and last brother, offered death a beer, and together they walked off into the unknown....
Hay Buddy, this one’s on me. It looks like them terrorists and gun nuts are working you to the bone.
One more won't kill me.
Cheers Bannon!
You're mistaking me for my son Father Time. That happens a lot on New Year's Eve.
Congratulations on North Korea!
Comeon, Halloween's over.
Thanks, I think I will. What's so important it can't wait?
Drink up. I think you about to be cut off.
No thanks. I already knocked the top off a tall one earlier...
What are going do to me if I don't give it to you?
Thanks but no thanks, I've had my fill of spirits.
I normally don't intervene, but dude really?! Two fisted drinking this early in the day?
Here's to making it to last call
Just a vodka soda- I'm watching my ghoulish figure.
Don't worry, man. That wasn't me that said "last call".
Thanks, but I'm on duty.
Have one with me, it won't kill you.
You seriously never considered that years of drinking a beer in each hand might have consequences?
I'm on duty - but I can take the top off those suds for you.
Hey buddy, this is for you...If I drink another one , it'll be the death of me.
Lemme guess...another round of layoffs at the plant today?
Do you like craft beer? This one's a little bitter, and the ending isn't too hoppy.
No, I didn't exactly fall from heaven.
Death, be not proud. Have a drink!
Can I just call you by your first name Angel?
Boy, am I glad to see you! I'm not sure whether the best news is that I don't have to eat any more kale, or that I don't have to argue "collusion isn't really a crime" on national TV!
I guess death is nature's way of telling me to slow down.
Yes, where there's life, there's Bud. And the other way around.
Let's have a few--I hear its hot where we're going.
Thanks for the beer but I'm still coming for you on December, 6, 2019."
Well, I must say, this is a first!
Right now, I could kill for a cold beer!...
Thank you - you're the first to appreciate my portrayal of Steve Bannon on Saturday Night Live!
Thanks, I was hoping for a bier!
Have one on me. Today's my birthday! I never did like that bartender anyway.
Hey, Buddy... let me buy you a drink. You look parched.
I can’t leave yet it’s BOGO hour.
I buy you a beer, you buy me some time, okay?
It is not going to kill you to have a drink with me
I guess I won't need this one for the road.
Your right this is your last call.
Thanks, man. I wasn't kidding when I said I'd kill for a beer.
Here. You look like you could use some cheering up.
Ah! When I think of the BILLIONS of yeast cells that have died for every pint of beer...
You look like I’ve had enough.
It should cure whatever ails you.
I said "I'm making my rounds", not "I need another round".
What took you so long?
Last call? I thought I had more time!
Grim and beer it.
..and here's to Judge Moore, Mr.Bannon!
You look like you could use this.
Man, your throat must be bone dry. Have a drink!
No thanks, you should enjoy your last two.
No thanks ... it impairs my productivity.
Here's to alll survivors.
Most folks have a bad day at work, it’s a bad day. I have a bad day at work and somebody doesn’t die.
Jerry, this is not what I meant by 'this is your last call.'
Have one on me and let's assume you're the Ghost of Christmas Future.
I would love to join you, but I'm also an Uber driver on the side.
Sure, I'll have another round with you. And is your name Frank Schmidt, by the way?
Cheers to remaining thing certain in this world
I am a little dry.
Here's to the fin de sickle or is that what they all say?
Why so grim? Want a drink?
Have one on me--it won't kill ya
What do you mean you can't accept a cold one?
Thanks! For some reason I can never catch the bartender’s eye.
Hey, how 'bout one for the road... or are you my designated driver?
Friends til the end?
What the hell. One more for the road.
Actually, I'm here on business.
Thanks but I’m here for a different last call.
Fears!
Before you say a thing, I'd like to propose a toast to my health!
Thanks, it’s been a killer week.
I’ve said no to mansions and kingdoms but this just might be your lucky day—I could really use a cold one.
That pesky taxman comes every April, but you, my friend, are a real class act a once in a lifetime opportunity!
Here's to your health.
The scythe came with the promotion.
OK, join me for this last round and I'll give you a ride home.
Kelly Anne, is that you? You look like death, girl.
No...No...Harry...we gotta make the front of that bus this time!
Here's looking at you, kid.
Dude, have one on me, it's to die for.
It's about time you showed up! I'm ready for this year to be over.
Sure Ted keep drinking. You're lucky I'm off the clock.
No thanks, I'm watching my weight.
Actually, I'm dying for a G&T.
Here is hoping this will finish your day.
Drinks on the hearse!
Whadda ya say I buy this round, and we call the chess thing even?
Here's to the New Year
No, thanks. I never drink before chess.
Sure, why not? I've been dying for a cold one all day.
You can blame the new thermostat settings on our seasonal helpers.
Ok, just one more before closing time.
Thanks, but I'm on duty - you might want to chug yours.
No thanks. I'm on duty, Mr. Kelly of 508 Joshua Lane.
Cheers, Man this last one’s gonna kill me.
No, thanks. Can't you see I've had one too many already?
Actually, I prefer martinis--bone dry.
Because I could not drink for death, Death, kindly drink for me?
Thanks. I'll buy the next 20 rounds. I hope my replacement has a better year next year.
here's to Christmas past ! !
Come on - one beer won't kill you!
Last round is on me.
Well, I guess I could have just one before you go.
Technically, I suppose they refer to the same thing, but in your case Mr. Wilson, I believe the expression 'Face Down' will soon be more descriptive than 'Bottoms Up'.
Here's to tax reform!
I know you're well over your quota. Let's celebrate!
No really you drink it Larry, I'll catch up to you in the ditch.
"Drink up, my friend! My recent healthcare proposal just received Trump's stamp of approval.
Thanks,but some cheese and crackers would really hit the spot.
Ok, but you're driving.
Til death do us part.
The next round is on me.
Hello stranger! Let's drink to live and let live.
Why thanks,..I'm just waiting for my MRI results.
If it's a real hell-brew you're after, partner, this is it
OK we'll have one the long road.
It's always one for the road.
No thanks. I'm here for the atmosphere.
I'll just die if this isn't the best beer you've ever tasted.
Okay, just one more, then we have to get back to business.
One drink won't kill you
Why so grim, have one on me.
Here, have a drink, you look like death
Okay, but this is last call. Deal?
Salute! Being self-employed isn't as easy as it looks, huh?
No thank you, that stuff will kill you.
Stop being such a Debbie Downer and have a beer.
Here's to the worst last call, ever.
Cheer up, Buddy  "Cheer up, Buddy! I mean it's not like somebody died, right?
Uh... You didn't hear me say Last Call?
Is it last call, already?
You think YOU have an Angry Orchard?
You sure as hell cleared out this joint.
So what if your time is up. It's on me!
No thanks. I’m the designated dier.
I know this trick. You get me drunk and then you steal my scythe.
Same deal as last year?
Here's to tax reform and making America grim again!
That brew might just buy you another five minutes!
C'mon. Have one more drink, it won't kill you."
Thanks, I've been dying for pint all day.
My day was a killer. Yours?
Ma always said to kill 'em with kindness.
Have a drink, it won't kill you.
You may as well drink this....I don't think I'm going to have time for a second one.
Don't be so grim. Have a beer.
I’m here to kill all the poor people that only spend their money on booze.
The good news is, you won't be charged for the beer.
This should kill your thirst.
I'm feeling much better this morning. Right, buddy?
If you promise to take me before the hangover kicks in, drinks are on me
One for the road home?
They say it goes right through you
Thanks, but I'm a little OCD about germs.
Care for a beer and a mop?
Here this one's on me. It's dead in here anyway.
Thanks but it really is my turn.
I hear ya pal…This place is dead tonight.
You go ahead, they go right through me.
You'll like it - it's got killer taste!
Thanks, I'll take both.
No thanks, I'm the Designated Scyther.
Here, you look like you are dying for a cold drink!
Sure, let's toast---I seem to be winning.
C'mon. It's not going to kill you.
Last call's on me.
The Specter of Death, a barfly, and an Invisible Man walk into a bar ...
You only die once.
Have this one. I feel like death too when I first come in.
You're going to wish you had drank them both.
That a Red Sox pennant?
It's last call!
Lively up yo’self!
Hey lets drink to life.
Well, it looks we beat taxes, how about a beer for you?
Here's one for the road.
I said "I'm here for you", not "is that beer for you..."
No thanks, I'm just killing time.
It didn't take you long to get here after approving the Tax Reform Bill.
Coincidentally, it's my last call, too.
Great idea! I'll change my scythe to a hoe during the holidays so I can say "Hoe, Hoe, Hoe!" to my new friends. Hoe, Hoe, Hoe!
This one is for you--after a bad day at work you look like death warmed over
Hey, you look like your best friend just died. Have one on me.
My wife’s in the bathroom, but she will be right back.
Here’s, to drinking and driving
No, I'm afraid it's more like 'Reaper' Time.
Enjoy one for the road
Is it a craft brew?
Yeah, it's a proactive, cold-calling position
A beer to die for
It's a New micro brew, Scythe Pale Ale. Looks like you know about it too.
I'm not here to toast your health.
You look like I need a drink.
One for the road to perdition?
You killed it today? Let me buy you a beer!
Do you come here often?
Thanks, but I'm driving.
Busy day?
No more social security. ... I'm buying!
Beer goggles claim another victim.
O K, one more, then we gotta go.
Ah, I suppose another pint wouldn’t hurt.
No thanks, I'm reaping......
I can't, Jimmy. I'm your designated scyther."
I made a killing today at the racetrack. And you?
Okay, one more, but Mrs. Death is gonna kill me.
I poured you one for the road.
Nah, you keep it. Enjoy!
"Jeez, another hard day at the office".
Senator, a toast to the tax bill, with my last beer!
Enjoy, we are all doomed anyway.
Here, have a beer while I show you lots of photos of my ex-wife.
Don't look at me like that! Come on, let's celebrate my life!
I figure it won't kill me to buy a stranger a drink.
Get a life.
Would it kill you to share one of those?
Thanks, but I'm waiting for Emily.
C'mon - one drink won't kill you!
Shoot, I'll tell you a sob story.
Thanks, but I shouldn't drink any alcohol since I will be driving you to my place.... Of course it's all for your safety concern.
Love your walking stick.
You can stay but I need your liver.
‘L’chaim’ back at you!
I would, but it runs right through me.
Have one of these . . . it may raise your spirits!
Go on, have a beer! It won't kill you!
Have a sip ,it will put a smile on your face
The hangover's death though.
I tell you when to take me when I'm drunk and ready!
Smile, Mr. Glass Half Empty!
Come on have a cold one, I know we can work this out!
Yes, ‘Hoppy Ending’ is a great name for a microbrew, but in this case, it’s also a bit ironic.
Drink up, and you won't look so grim.
Why so grim?!
No thanks, I'm fine. That stuff goes right through me.
I operate heavy machinery. What do you do for a living?
This is for you -- I figure if nothing stops you, one drink sure won't.
Drinking can impair your judgement. Joe was about to find out the hard way...
Happy hour? Sure...if you'd like to call it that.
You indulge?
C'mon, one beer never killed anyone.
Here, you gotta try this brew -- it's to die for!
No thanks, I only drink scotch and hemlock.
You look like a dark beer guy!
Ok, but next round is with me.
Well, after this week I’m no longer certain about my taxes.
Ah, there's no more road to have one for, Bud.
It's really pale, try it. I know you'll like.it.
Have a beer, man. You look like death warmed over.
Excuse me. Could you please lop-off the head of my beer?
I deserve it. Your mother-in-law was a tough old bird
Congratulations on your liposuction.
Even though she said, "It's not you, it's me" I'm pretty sure it was me, she never liked what I did for work.
Come on, one beer won't kill ya...
And what is your line of work, my friend?
What tipped you off that I'm running for the Senate?
I would except.......wait, are you blind?
No, thanks--I like a dark bier.
Have a beer on me. You're kinda late for Halloween, but that is one hellova costume.
Thanks! But actually, that's the one that gets you.
No thanks, you're driving
You can thank me in the car, or you can call Uber.
Care to join me for my last last call G.R.?
Thanks, I’ve had one hell of a week.
No, I said "I've come for you."
Thanks Larry, that's just what I need...my throat's bone dry.
Your friend randomly didn't show up? - sure, I'll take his beer.
One more before last call?
Salud!
I'm a demon when I get wasted.
I bought two beers, seeing though I'm not driving home tonite.
One more before we hit the road?
Some people will do anything to get out of a bar tab...
Nice costume. Let's drink on it.
Tonight is kind of special, let it be Lowenbrau.
You don’t need to pry this from my cold dead hands, it’s all yours!
Yes, I will have one for the road. After all, it is last call.
Drink up while you still can.
You want one for the road?
Tough Day? You look like you could use a beer.
So, new in town? Me too. Here's to a long life!
No thanks. I don't have a stomach for it.
The rent’s sky high, my kid needs bail money, and my car got swiped. But at least I made a new friend.
I'm a huge blue oyster cult fan too!
Well may you say "It's Miller time!" but I'm casting my net a little wider.
Just because you're afraid to be alone doesn't mean you have to keep following me.
You look like you've had a killer week.
C'mon. One beer won't kill you.
Thanks. I'll get you later.
Ask not for whom the beer foams...
Thanks, buddy! I guess one more won't kill me.
I'd say you pay your tab right now.
Here, have one. You need it as much as I do.
No thanks. You drink them both, I'll buy you another, then let's go for a drive.
Thanks. I'll pay you back sooner than you think.
No thanks, I'm a designated driver.
Okay, you have convinced me, you need this brew much more than I do.
Join me for last call?
Come and join me. It’s dangerous to drink alone.
Here’s to ya, Mr. Bannon.
That's cheating.
I never drink on the job.
Good call. It's senior discount day.
It's made with water from Flint, Michigan but I'm sure you don't mind.
Whoops, my friend was here a minute ago.
No, Fred! Your wife is still going to kill you when you get home.
dilly dilly
I'm coming! I'm coming! I just need to finish these beers.
Here you go. Let's drink to my health.
NO, I literally can't hold my beer...
No thanks, last time you talked me into too many, and you got a reprieve.
Join me in one for the road?
Have a beer, Grimmy. The guy on the floor is in no hurry.
Want to see me lop off all the heads with one swing?
Regrettably, that's not the bier I had in mind.
Here, it won’t kill you.
Could you kill this for me?
Ask not for whom the beer foams - it foams for thee."
I knew there had to be a catch.
When they said last call, I had no idea it was not just for tonight
That's a pretty nifty Halloween costume you got there, buddy....but I've seen better.
I'm not going anywhere until I finish my beer.
No thanks. You drink it.....but don't forget your car keys.
No thanks-- I'm stone cold sober.
C'mon. One drink won't kill me.
Thanks anyway, but I don't drink while I'm working.
It's okay. I posted fake pictures too.
No thanks, I'm a spirits kind of guy.
Cheer up, its not so grim.
I guess you've got time for one more.
Time for one more?
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Here's to a life, well... lived.
OK then one for the road
Koufax....'65...382 K's....pay up!
Fake brews?
Cheers! You just made my day. So, what brings you in here tonight?
Don't you find IPAs a little hoppy?
Rough year, dude? You look like you need this more than me.
Since you are here, why not a last drink on me.
Ah, come down and join me. It won’t kill you to have one beer with me.
I don't drink. I reap.
Let me get you this beer; you look dead tired
Nah, haven’t touched the stuff since Prince.
Just the one, thanks. I gotta get to the First Amendment rally out in front of the White House.
Thanks. My day's been pretty grim.
Hell, you look like you could use a drink.
Now that they got rid of that death tax, I can pursue boozin' and whorin' with whatever time I got left.
Glad you're back with Breitbart. Cheers!
Here's a 'cold-one' for the Doppelgänger of a guy who showed up last year right before Harry 'passed-on'.
You know Happy Hour's over, right?
It's cold. You like cold, right?
Here's one for the road, or wherever we're headed.
Gimme a minute, one more soul and I'm off duty.
No thanks, it would be the death of me.
Thanks, but I can't be caught scything under the influence.
Thanks pal, but tonight I'm the designated dier.
I'll buy you a beer if you promise to end this year early.
One for the road? How thoughtful!
Here’s mud in your socket.
Hey fella, you look a little grim. This one's on me.
No thanks, but I could kill for some peanuts right about now.
Casual Friday or not, I can't dodge the company dress code.
It's on me—I just made a killing!
Slain!... I mean... sláinte!
Care to have one for the road my friend?
You're late.
No thanks. I'm the designated driver tonight.
Wait a second....I followed the rules! ‘Liquor then beer...’
When death is your bouncer, you don't see too many bar fights.
I heard it was Last Call, so I got you one for the road.
C'mon, would it kill you to have one more?
Hey buddy, why the grim face?
Thanks. It's been a killer day.
No thanks. And by the way, that was your last call for alcohol.
No thanks, it goes right thru me. Enjoy.
Thanks. But I never drink while working.
Have a drink buddy, you're looking a little grim these days.
One last drink?
You gotta try this drink! It's killer.
It won't kill ya
Thanks anyway, I've already had 2 Zombies.
Let's have a beer, and I'll give you some names.
I heard that hoods were back in style." "You still look like death!
This is most definitely your last call!
Trade ya.
No thanks, I'm watching my weight.
No, you go ahead.
Try this, these guys make a killer IPA.
Cheers to that shiny flag of your!
Thanks, but I don't drink and scythe.
Aw, c'mon. It won't kill you...
I might as well have another since you're here.
No thanks. I never reap and drive.
Look, buddy - it's rush hour. We're not going anywhere.
Sure, it's last call, after all.
No thanks, I hear it's not good for you.
Here's to tonight's skeleton crew!
No thanks, I can finally drink absinthe
Last call on me buddy!
Have a beer man, you're looking pretty grim right now.
I would, but I already have two strikes for "ferrying under the influence".
Your right, I'm dying for a beer.
I’ll pass...I tend to make a mess when I drink
What exactly is Happy Hour?
Hey, why so grim?
No, I just have that kind of skull.
Nah, I've stopped drinking on the job.
Not my kind of spirits.
Well, I am off the clock in a few minutes.
Charlie! It’s me, Matt.
I am truly sorry but I am not allowed to drink when I pick up fares
Here, have one on me...you look like death.
Come on, have one! It won't kill you!
I would kill for a beer right now.
I guess one more beer won't kill me
Chug a little of this, you grim bastard.
Thanks! Don't mind if I do. This cape does not have pockets, so I don't carry a wallet at work. Been a long day.
Mr. Reaper, you're wrong! Beer does, in fact, help me drive better.
You say bier; I say beer.
This IPA is to die for!
Every time someone offers death a beer, some pompous ass somewhere gets hit by a bus
So it's last call, is it?
Don't worry - funeral expenses will still be an itemized deduction.
"You look terrible,man. Here have a brewski...
Shall we drink to the G.O.P., Buddy?
What have you got to lose?
No thanks, but drink up and I'll help you find your car.
I'll drink it. But I won't say L'Chaim.
Well, I guess there's enough time for one before the North Korea thing happens.
L'Chaim, buddy!
Thanks but the boss would kill me if he finds out I'm drinking on the job
You're lookin' at the guy who put the "pale" in I.P.A.
Thanks for the beer, but why do you want me to chug it?
Hey--come on! You take death too seriously.
No thanks. Any more and I’ll lose my grimness.
Work getting you down?
lets drink to your victory and my inevitable demise
Are you here for me, or the beer?
Don't be a stiff---have a drink.
This beer's yours if you at least wait until I finish 'The Bachelorette' season finale!
Gluten free? Trust me, that stuff will kill you.
Thanks, but I'll be driving you home.
No thanks. I'm still on duty.
Thanks for the beer! Though I will only have time for one, I have an appointment with the guy at the end of the bar.
Hey, buddy, sit down and have a cold one. I wasn't expectin' you til next month.
He went to the Men's room half an hour ago. Why don't you have his beer?
C'mon. Don't be such a buzzkill.
Can't drink anymore. Goes right through me.
Beer always makes me appear more prone to existence, or at least less wannabe dead.
Let’s drink to better days ahead
Sure. But only if it's gluten-free.
Here you go Mr. Reaper, last call.
Obamacare has ruined my business.
So I guess the Jerusalem thing was the tipping point for you, too.
Beer usually runs right through me, but what the hell?
You're a great brother-in-law.
Thoughtful, but fruitless.
I'd kill for a nice cold beer.
I hope you're a fast drinker.
This one's for you pal, you look a little grim.
Relax! What's your hurry? Have one on me.
Can I actually get some hard liquor? I’ve had a killer day
I'd kill for a beer. Well, not literally.
Here. Kill it... if you can.
It's not a "let's." It's a "you're"...toast.
One more, and then let's go?
Come on Hal. You know I can't hold my liquor.
C'mon, one hasn't ever killed anyone - or has it?
I’m your designated driver!
Glad your're here, when it's this dead its two for one.
...on the other hand, it's perfectly fine to BEER the reaper.
Sure, I'd love a beer, but I'm actually still on the clock...
I'll pass--the stuff goes right through me.
A Tu Salud Amigo!
Happy Hour isn't going to work for you...
Sharing is daring, I was never here.
That is mighty kind of you, but I am on the clock...Hey! speaking about Time...
Come on...one for the road won't kill you.
No, please, I insist.
No thanks this time Ed, this is more of a professional visit.
Still in your Halloween costume?
It's IPA--Interment Prevention Assurance.
Could I interest you in one more for the road before we go??
You know, you could be the Happy Reaper.
I'm his designated driver.
Are you sure? It’s last call.
I hope you're not expecting me to be the life of the party.
A toast to Trump's demise.
Hey, Pal, join me for Happy Hour!
What makes you think it's poison?
The last guy who offered me one for the road ended up at the front of the line.
Well if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.
Of all the gin joints in all the world...
Death becomes him
YOLO, buddy!
This stout is so strong. I see Death when I drink it. Wanna try some?
Let’shave a beer and bury the hatchet
Well thank you, fortuitous location for last call.
Here, let’s share one for the road.
Here ya go mate, let me lift your spirit.
No buddy, to your health.
Welcome to the Opioid Belt.
Here's to the Bitcoin.
Sure, I guess one wouldn't kill me.
Come on ..one won't killya
How about a beer, in exchange for my wife?
You're gonna thank me in the mourning!
It's true; light drinking will extend your life - for about 5 minutes.
Last ones on me!
No thanks. I can't hold my liquor.
Cheers! Last orders please...
No thanks, I don't drink on the job. By the way, your buddy's not late. He's 'late' if you know what I mean...
Yes, let's share an Uber.
No thanks, those things will kill you.
Thanks... I never know where the next one's coming from.
Thanks for the beer, but everything goes right through me.
I guess one wouldn't kill me. Speaking of which....
Boy, I love this job!
I'd have one too, but I don't want to take the edge off.
Go ahead, man, have one on me. You're the stuff of legends: the Great Plague, Scrooge's Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the President's ex-chief strategist. This year's been crazy and the only cure is MORE COWBELL!
No thanks. Beer just goes straight through me.
I'm not usually around for Happy Hour.
Good riddance to 2017. Let's get on with it.
Man, it's dead in here tonight.
Are you my Uber driver
You look down in the dumps...have one on me.
Speed Date?
I only drink dark beer.
Please keep drinking, i am on duty !
A final one for the final road?
Let's just say I'm a people person.
Lets drink to a long life.
C’mon man. One more won’t kill you.
For a second there I thought you were my wife ... now that would've been REALLY bad!
No thanks, I’m just here for the salmonella.
I am drinking to a buddy. Maybe you know him.
Till we meet again!
Thanks- but I think I'll remove the head first.
I'll drink mine, but you might want to order yours 'to go'.
Here, take Pete's, I don't think he's coming back.
No, thanks. I'm just waiting 'til you drive home.
I'll have another, but only if you drive.
Hey ol' pal how did the x-rays go?
They're both for you! I'm driving.
No thanks, I’m scything tonight.
Here's one for ya, laddie. Don't look so grim.
I had what he's having
Drink up! It's all you can drink for the next 5 minutes!
I only come here for the appetizers.
Lay off and this one's on me.
Yeah OK. You've got time for one more.
No, I meant we should get a bier together.
"To second chances!'
Aw, go ahead- it's not that kind of bier.
I can use that. I've been in a spiritual crisis since the Trump election.
Don’t be so grim, buddy. Here, have a beer.
No, Thanks. I gave the stuff up years ago after a health scare.
Thanks for the offer, but I'm still on the clock.
Are you certain this is Happy Hour?
What'd you say your name was? Jim Reefer?
Here, have my extra beer. You just missed last call.
You look like you need a bier.
Sure, to whatever tomorrow does not bring.
Have them both--Bill can't make it.
No, thanks. I'm on call.
Not now, thanks. Rules say: If you drink don't reap.
Final final?
No thanks, buddy--I can't be drinking and driving you to Hades.
Move any closer and you'll be drinking alone.
Yes, thanks. I will join you but remember you can only die once.
why not? I'm dead already.
I heard you were interested in near death experiences.
Right. Nothing is certain except death and now tax reform.
Thanks, human. I have something for you, too.
Not till I've finished both!
...and don't worry: You won't be needing a bathroom.
Hey Bannon, you're looking down man, this one's for you!
Normally I wouldn’t make this trade but I could really use a beer.
Won’t you join me?” “I was just going to ask you the same.
Well, I suppose I could have just one…
Drink while you wait?
Sorry, I can't drink while working....
Cures what ales ya!
Hey, come on - it'll put some meat on those bones.
You and your scythe aren’t going anywhere after you taste this pumpkin spice IPA.
Hey, beautiful, how 'bout one for the road on me?"
Check it out, this brew is killer!
Yeah yeah, you should totally drive home tonight.
If it makes you feel better, my liver's failing.
Here’s to our tomorrows!
Thanks, but I can't...it goes right through me.
No thanks, I'm a designated driver.
One for the road? Much obliged.
No, you have it. After all, you are the designated dyer tonight.
No problem, I planned on taking you home tonight.
Oh, sure- just this once.
You’re a bit early, its not until the hangover tomorrow that Ill want to die
I guess you could call it a mid-death crisis.
Hey pal, when you're done with those beers, mind giving me a ride?
With the new GOP tax plan and cuts to medical coverage, you're going to be a busy boy.
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world...
Don't worry buddy. I'm on your scythe.
This one's on me.
Take it! It’s not going to kill you.
Are you talkin' to me?
C'mon, let's drink to my health.
These 2-for-1s are too much for me. Want to help me kill this one?
Love to! I be not proud!
Here's to death, because death will give me one last bier.
Don't I know you from the graveyard shift?
Listen, when you hear "Death lies on her like an untimely frost / Upon the sweetest flower of all the field," you feel like: Whoa. Is this how people really see me?
Have a brewski what's the worst that can happen?
Maybe this will help put a little meat on you!
It's totally yours if you reconsider.
You'er welcome, and I'm pretty sure it isn't Happy Hour.
C'mon, one mo won't kill you
Have one on me! You look a little parched.
Have a beer. It won't kill you.
Careful buddy, that stuff will be your death.
Here's to not being the only one to haunt this place.
Join me for one before closing time?
Ha! Well, I”m known as the Rim Gripper!
No thanks, bro. It goes right through me.
C'mon..a little sip of beer never killed anyone.
How about one for the road, before we go?
No thanks. I'll just wait until you finish yours.
Well, you look grim. Here's to happy hour.
Would it kill you to have a beer with me?
Have a drink; it's not like it'll kill ya.
UBER?
Let's raise a glass to the ghost of Bannon past!"
Can we wait until happy hour is over?
Salud! one last one before we hit the road?
Either that...or it'll make you stronger
Hey man, how many graves will I be digging this week?
You look like you could use one for the road.
Dude! From out of town?
No thanks, I'm riding with you.
Thanks.....but liquids go right through me.
Carl was about to learn that Death only stops by to take out.
I'd love to but I'm the designated reaper.
Here's to celebrate another year!
I know you're burnt out. We'll have a beer and think about new career opportunities for you.
Here, this one will really make you come alive.
One for the road..on me, pal
Try this brew; it is a killer.
And you have a GREAT 2018, as well.
No way. You're dead to me.
No thanks. I prefer dark, hoppy stouts, with a hint of death
Drink them both and see what happens.
Here’s to a deal you can’t refuse
C'mon. There's always time for a beer!
Thanks, but I'm on the clock.
Shall we drink "to life"?
You're welcome, and you can have a nightcap at my place later.
No thanks, I'm scything.
No thanks, I'm watching the waistline.
A toast to you Trump! Good over evil always wins!
No Thanks; I'm driving.
Here you go. I heard someone once say in heaven there is no beer.
Yes, I do come here often.
Only if you let me drive!
Sit down, have a beer and tell me your problems.
Shall we drink to your health?
Cheers, pal. They offer "2-for-1" in your line of work?
Happy Death Day!!!
You can have it. He just ran across the street." "I know.
You need to drink that down quickly.
Say, how 'bout one for the road?
Sorry but I am the designated driver for tonight
If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put you and die together.
Enjoy happy hour. Last call's coming soon.
Thanks, just let me remove the head first.
Yeah, I'll take a pint. I'm tired just thinking about how busy I'll be once the Republicans take away everyone's health coverage.
Can's a man buy his mother-in-law a drink?
Since Harry won't be drinking this one, Cheers!
I could use a cold one.
Nah, but I could really use a cigarette.
I've been expecting you....
No thanks, Kevin — but I will accept that ride home later. It’s sort of on my way...ha ha...
Well, you're not drivin' are ya?
Down the hatch. It won't kill you.
"Who's your tailor"?
Right, I understand you have some digestive issues. But you have to appreciate the gesture...
Here's to cliché's.
'You only go around once in life.' But I guess you knew that.
And I looked, and held out a pale ale: and his name that sat beside me was Death.
Were you at the Grateful Dead concert or is my beer trying to tell me something?
Yeah, alright, but just this one. Last time I drank with you, I got fucking blotto and mixed up Lil Peep and Lil Pump.
Cheers! Have a drink. You don't need to worry about a beer belly!
Yes! To your health - such as it is.
Look buddy, I don't want a beer. You were supposed to be home 4 hours ago so your wife told me to come get you.
Come here often?
L’chaim!....not.
No, that's OK - you have it. I'm just hangin', waiting for closing time.
Come here often?
One more for the road?
Actually I was hoping for someone drop-dead gorgeous.
You look like you could use one.
Let's have one more for the road.
Apparently one of us has yet to meet his daily quota
Really? That hat doesn't say "courting Death" enough for ya?
Join me in one for the road?
Throw in some potato skins and I'll hold off until after the holidays.
That's on me, pal. The Ferryman down on the river Styx just HATES it when I bring drunks onboard.
C'mon don't be shy. We all have our demons
One for the road to perdition?
Thanks, but I'm really not in a 'L'Chaim' mood.
Have a beer. It won't kill you.
not so fast on the last call Mr. (Hiccup) Death
C'mon, one last drink?
Of all the Gin Joints...
Cum on, it's happy hour. Beer's on me.
This should help lift your spirits.
Thanks for the children. Per our agreement I will repeal the death tax!
Looks like you’ve been working all night!
Florida? In the summertime? Grab a beer buddy, you’re going to be busy for a while.
Look, what do YOU have to lose?
No shame in being parched, eh?
Nothing worse than a dry drunk
Sip it while its cold ... and I'm not
Have a beer, buddy...you look like death warmed over.
Ok, but first a little beer pong, loser pays.
C'mon, it's Happy Hour.
Oh, okay... one more, but you're gonna be the death of me yet!
Wusher name? Graham Reeper? C'mon over, I gotta joke that'll kill ya.
Mazel Tov! L'Chaim!
Don't be so grim. Have a beer.
Relax buddy, let your scythe down a little and have one for the road...
Thanks for the offer. But I only drink light beer.
Seriously?
I would, but my shift starts in ten.
And this one is for me, too, you life-killing, party-pooping, ugly black-hooded killjoy of life!
Death, good to see you back at one of your old haunts. I heard you lost your job to the current Administration. This one's on me.
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, you walk into mine. Here's looking at you, kid.
I know you're not supposed to accept bribes, but...
It's closing time..last call.
Looks like you could use a few carbs.
Let's talk about Donald Trump: He eats two Big Macs in one sitting, ya know....
Hello, 911 Operator? I need an ambulance, and an attorney. My wife just served me with divorce papers!
Charon is your designated driver?
One more before we hit the road?
May I Be In Heaven A Half Hour Before The Devil Knows I'm dead
No thanks! I'm just hanging out but I hope to meet up with you later.
Take off that silly coat & hood and come join me for a beer.
Here’s to the end of farm season!
If I could smoke in here, my life would be complete.
It’s not like it’s going to kill you to have one for the road.
Thanks, but that stuff just goes through me.
Thanks, but you may want that beer after you hear what I have to say.
I shouldn't – I'm about to meet a priest and a rabbi.
Kill here often?
Have one on me, buddy. Looks like you could use a "Happy Hour".
Bad day, friend?
I could use that drink. Work was murder today.
Have them both There ain't none where you're headed
Man, these Happy Hour prices are killer.
When the bar tender said last round, I misinterpreted his meaning.
Thanks, but I've got a different 'tall cold one' for you.
A kind offer, but I'm afraid I'm working under a tight deadline.
Of course my work is grim, that’s why I drink!
Hey, get a life.
What with the particularly busy year you've had, you look like you could use a tall one.
I'm touched - hardly anybody wants to have a beer with me.
Here you go, pal. You look like you've been working overtime. Besides, my wife is gonna kill me if I have one more.
As long as you're here, it's happy hour everywhere else too.
I see your reaping the benefits of that new conceal carry law, Jim.
How about a drink for the road?
Thanks, but I was just leaving for Samarra.
Grim Reaper? No, sorry. I’m Baby New Year. 2018... well, it’s gonna be tough.
I take cash only.
Let's have a drink at my place.
Truce?
Sounds like today's been killing ya bud.
At this point it can only make you stronger.
Designated dier!
No thanks. If I drink this early, I'll be dead for the rest of the day.
Of all the beer joints in all the towns in all the world, you walk into this one. Here's looking at you, kiddo!
No, I said I'm here for you not a brew!
No thanks, I just ordered a Molotov Cocktail.
You're looking pretty grim. Here, have a beer.
Come on, have a drink. One can't kill you.
Aw, c’mon, have one ... it won’t kill ya,
L'Chaim, buddy!
Hey, beer today, gone tomorrow!
To Life! To Life! L'chayim!
Last call? Why not.
Let's do a cheers to life.
Here — it'll be the death o' ya!
Don't be so grim, have a drink on me
What’s your catch today?
Did you hear the ACA deadline was December 15th?
Sure, I could murder a beer right now.
Since when did this bar get so grim?
I drink to dull the pain, but you eliminate it. Love your work.
One too many?
Death be not proud have one on me.
Sorry. I never drink on the job.
No thanks. I really don't have time and neither do you!
No, you have them both; then I will get what I want.
Taken in moderation, it won’t kill you.
Here's to another new year.
Please — I always hate to see a beer go to waste!
Thanks for the beer, but I'm still not going home with you.
Grim times for sure, have a drink.
Good job weeding out the unemployed.
Have an hour to kill?
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?
How nice! People usually offer me Clamato™!
Looks like you had a bad day too!
This seems like a karmic toss-up.
This one’s on me, but you owe me one.
Hey, don't be so Grim... its happy hour.
Nah, I already got drunk in the underworld.
You've got a face of an angel! Let me buy you a drink.
It's too bad you can't drink on the job, you really slayed today.
It's on me. These new craft beers are to die for.
Here, have a beer before we go.
You want this beer? Looks like that last one did my buddy in.
Hi! You must be new around here.
If only there was a better way to spend halloween
What are you afraid of? A drink never killed anyone.
Here's to a good long friendship
Trust me, you're going to need that more that me.
Sorry pal, but I have no stomach for beer.
Yo! is that a Mets Flag?
Since you're driving, these two are mine.
Here, I bought this for Joe you haven't seen him have you?
Thanks for the free round, partner! You say you're a salesman? What is this 'cirrhosis' you're selling anyway?
L'chaim! L'chaim! To life!
One now, and one after you visit Washington
Yes, I do feel like a draft.
'It's not even last call yet.'
I was hoping that you were here for the bartender.
You're drinking 'til death do us part'? REALLY?
Have one on me, Buddy. Looks like you got into some bad juice.
No thanks, I am gluten intolerant.
Cheers to you, too. Drink up, I'm on a schedule.
Okay, ... but you could at least share a 'Widow Maker Kick-the-Bucket Ale' with me first.
Tax cuts, you say? You have my vote!
How about a little something to take the edge off?
Another one for the road?
Have a beer. It'll reduce the shock when you look in a mirror.
--Bad day? -- Pretty grim, yeah.
One more drink is not going to kill you!
Larry, you've been saying just one the whole week.
Why so grim, pal?
It never ceases to amaze me how one can liven up another's day.
I may as well be dead than drink alone.
Recent research shows that alcohol is good for your heart.
Oh come on, Lighten up!
No thanks, I can live without it.
Okay, but just one.
The faster I drink, the closer you get.
Sorry, not a big fan of happy hour.
Much appreciated ...and consider canceling your skydiving lesson this afternoon.
You remind me of my first wife.
Here's to better days!
Thanks buddy, I'll spot you a day.
Just one won’t kill you!
Here's a "pint", to a better tomorrow.
Hold my beer.
Aah, go ahead, it won't kill ya'.
That's not the kind of head it removes.
Hey, let's hoist one; then you can get back to Congress and beginning cutting Medicare.
Heaven can wait; have a pint.
I'm dying to have a beer with you!
Take a sip. It won't kill you.
Dude, you can play Steve Bannon on the SNL!
Thanks. Yeah she just...left. Put all my stuff in storage. I had just done Tom Petty for God's sake.
And a drink on the house for that darkly cloaked End-Times guy from Hell who's been following me around ever since I voted for Donald Trump.
You gotta have one! How many can say they drank to AND with Death?
You really want to celebrate your last call?
No, I’m the only Ghost of Christmas making an appearance this time. Glad to see you’re taking it so well.
No thanks, I’m deathly allergic to gluten.
It's true what they say about girls looking better at last call.
Thanks for the beer tall, dark and gruesome!
"You know, a lot of people say I shouldn't be proud of what I do, but you seem to embrace it".
No, one really cold beer is NOT going to cover it.
Bartender! Keep ‘em coming!
Here's to you Mr. President!
No thank you, I've been sober for 2,017 years.
Thanks but I don’t have the stomach for it any more.
I’d kill for a beer right now.
Yeah, I usually order two when it's last call.
But if we turn the heat on, I'm afraid we will lose our best employee.
A couple more beers bro and you'll be the giddy reaper."
My wish just came true, so why not yours?
Make it one for the Reaper, and one more for the road.
Well then, here's to my last round.
Thanks but I've got one more drunk driver to care off and then I'm off the clock.
Personally, I didn't think he had a snowball's chance in hell.
C'mon over, I'm taking care of it myself.
Skull!
Here, have one on me before the end of the world!
Thanks, but how do you find joy in the face of me?
It doesn't help that my sponsor is Gluttony.
Thanks, but no. People don’t take The Buzzed Reaper seriously.
À votre santé.
Here's to Life!
Who has to die to get a drink around here?
I'd better quit, you're starting to look pretty good to me
Looks like you had a long day. Here, have a beer. You'll feel better!
Let’s have another! What’s the rush?
Right behind you, bud.
Thanks--I am dying for a cold one.
I can wait. Unlike you, I have all the time in the world.
No thanks, I'm just here for your liver.
No thank you. One can only drink one's self to death once.
No thanks, beer just runs right through me.
One more for the reaping?
Finally! I'd been drinking your rounds the whole time.
If I can't beat them I guess I'll have to join them.
Can we make a deal?
Drink and drive!
A last one? Sure. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
No thanks, I'm actually waiting for you to drink enough of that.
Hmmm, maybe you are right. I am feeling less grim.
''hey , it's the new school crossing guard "
C'mon friend, wouldn't you kill for a nice cold one?
Have one on me. It must be tough being grim all the time.
Well, it looks like you're not dying of thirst
This one's on me now that I won't have to pick up the tab.
Thanks, but I'm on duty.
No, thank you. Beer goes right through me.
Belly up!
L'chaim yourself.
No thanks, not good for my health. You have them both.
Remind me: What circle of hell is this again?
Come on. It won't kill you.
If there's one thing for certain, it's tax reform.
On me, I hate drinking by myself.
If you don't fire him I'm turning on the heater.
What's to fear? One more drink's not going to kill you.
For you I recommend this very pale ale.
Sorry, I don’t toast “L’Chaim”.
Thanks....its been a Helluva day.
No thanks; I'm on the carriage
It goes right through me too.
my man
Cmon. Just one beer. I won’t report you.
I'd love to . Of course you realize that I won't be returning the favor.
No head please.
On me, just for the hell of it.
Would you mind ordering me a mop with that? Beer goes right through me.
Okay, maybe just one before we go.
Thanks, but I'm due back in another cartoon in 15 minutes.
Hey man, you want to kill a beer with me?
Take this, it won't hurt you none!
We are all having fun down here.
It's not a bribe. Research has linked moderate drinking with improved bone density.
Make America grim again!
No thanks. I'm the designated driver tonight.
I'd love to, mate, but I never drink on the job.
Don't worry about it - Venmo me later.
Have a drink, you handle a sickle way better than any republican congressmen!
Each drink brings me closer to you
Have another one. It won't kill ya.
Beer isn’t even a spirit. And in any event, I meant “soul.”
Thank you sir! You certainly know how to elevate a man's soul.
I don't take bribes. Come with me.
Slow down; take a load off; l'chaim!
One for the ditch
You look like Death. On me?
Here, buddy. Let's drink to my health!
I got this round - let's you and me liven this place up.
C’mon. It’s gluten-free.
A lite beer for you, it tastes like death
I'd kill for a nice cold beer.
Mr. Bannon. You'll need a beer if you're headed back to Pennsylvania Avenue.
Penny for your thoughts.
'Have a drink, you look like death warmed up.'
Ok, one last drink but then let’s call it a day
Not even one beer? Come on, you're killin' me!
To America!
Oh, go on! It won't kill ya.
Or something hot to send you on your way
Wait! Just one more...
Not when I’m killing.
You'll need a mop.
No thanks! Not when I'm on the job. It affects my swing.
Hey! Are you buyin’ or dyin’?
Come on. Another one won’t kill ya.
Hahahaha. Oh man. You kill me. Too funny. Let me buy you a drink.
Let's have one for the road to ruin.
Don't look so grim! Let's drink to life.
Hey, thanks buddy for the last call.
May I interest you in our unhappy hour specials?
So, tell me about your life.
Tap beer? That’s your best offer?
I prefer umbrella drinks but if you are buying...
You look like death, have a drink!
Thanks, but it goes right through me.
Leave your work at the office, beer is on me.
Bet you 100 bucks you can't finish them both.
Bloody tourists.
Have a beer, man. You look like death warmed over.
Whaddya say, Pal: ‘To Life!’
Assuming you're the Two-for-Tuesday DJ?
Why so grim, buddy?
Drink up. It's the last call.
I was just passing by but the condition you were in stopped me dead in my tracks!
I was hoping for a Bloody Mary.
Thanks, but beer goes right through me.
No thanks, I'm on the thirteen step program.
Go ahead. Drink up. You're the designate dier.
Don't mention it. I'll be back real soon.
Stay there, I'll slide it to you.
Buddy, whatever you need, I'm your guy. Just keep the beers coming.
I know you're dying for it.
No, thanks. I'm on duty.
I never trust anyone who doesn't drink.
Yes that was me on Fox News.
Got a bloody Mary?
One won't kill you.
Have one, Lloyd! You look really dehydrated!
And you said that I wouldn't even buy you a drink after our divorce.
Sir, will you hold my beer while I try to breakdance?
Just wait until you see how he comes in on casual Friday.
Now that my friend is gone, would you like the beer?
Time to go home, Larry. I'm gonna let you drive.
No thanks, I'm trying to cut out carbs.
Tough day at work?
Long break?
List? What list?
Better hurry up an’ order, Bud. Happy hour’s ‘bout to end.
Sorry, I'm not allowed to drink on the job. Hehehe!
I was going to drink both of these, but it looks like you could use some hydrating fluids before we go.
Beautiful what's your hurry?
How 'bout a free beer... looks like you could use it tonight.
If that drink doesn't kill you, I will.
Thanks, but I'd rather get a bloody Mary.
This may be the death of me, but, the way you look, I'm thinking you need it more than me.
It took me a while, but I remember you now....... from that Monty Python sketch!
Do we have time for a cold one?
Have a drink. My business is dying also.
Okaaay then. I'll just drink this one myself.
Have one of these drinks. I have a feeling my liver is about to take a turn for the worse.
Stuck in the same dead-end job forever? I know the feeling. This is for you, buddy.
No, no – you'll need both before we go for our little drive.
"Cmon, join me".
Yes, thanks. Don't you just love last call?
I don’t usually take bribes but. A new IPA you say...
Drink up , we met a couple of weeks ago when you were wearing plaid!
Ah, c'amon. It won't kill ya!
Have a sip - it won't kill you.
This may be a conflict of interest. Let me check with ethics...
Here's to you. Thanks for your visit to Charlie Manson...
Here’s mud in your ..... never mind.
Looks like you need this, must be your peak season.
Can you still deduct this as a business expense?
C’mon - one more won’t kill ya!
Back off! Just because I act shy and vulnerable doesn’t mean I want attention.
That's ok. You can pay me later.
The IRS didn’t wanna go for a cold swim, do you?
I felt inclined to buy you a beer.
Might I buy you ten more before you drive home.
Here's one for my baby and one for the end of the road
Thanks for offering, but I don't drink on the job.
Have one for the road Bud.
I can't. I've got a long night ahead of me.
Last call. This one’s on me.
For me?! Person of the Year?!... I'll drink to that.
June 9, 2016, Trump Tower.
How'd you know I've been feeling grim to the brim?
Just one, Grim. It may take the edge off.
Oh, no thanks....I've been on the wagon for a couple of centuries now. But that's the GOOD news....
Wanna try it by chocolate?
You like'em ice cold, don't ya?
Oh, why not? It's your neck!
I can’t, I’m on the clock.
Did I understand you to say: "Beero is my hero?"
Did I die and go to heaven?
Another free round!? You're killin' me over here.
Enjoy your last last call, Allen.
Here’s to going gently,knight.
No thanks, buddy, that stuff will kill you...
"Yo Steve! It's me, Roy. This one's on me"!
I don't have a chest.
This may be not such a bad idea!
It's not gonna kill ya just try it
Don't worry - it won't kill you
O.K., one more drink; then you have to drive home.
Drink up. I'll give you the one.
This will be the death of me!
I would usually offer. But since it's you I am going to drink all I can while I am still here. Cheers!
Thanks! Let me lop off that head. I'll take the beer, too.
Keep it. I'm trying to cut down.
Let me guess. Unhappy hour?
I am told this drink will add years to your life
Where next do we go to celebrate, scythe unseen?
Jeez pal, take this. You look like Death warmed over.
OK, one more. But this really is 'last call'.
'I'm fine, that stuff just goes through me.'
You look like you could use a beer!
No thanks, I just can't hold my beer the way I used to.
Whaddaya say? One for the river?
Lets have a little night-cap sweetheart before we negotiate a price.
No thanks,I am on the job, Bob.
Who did you harass?
Have one on me, buddy. Nothing to be afraid of.
I got the picture, let me enjoy this while I can still see the sun.
Chill, man! When I said I could not stop for death, I was just quoting someone else.
I'm afraid not--it's closing time, my friend.
Drink up like there's no tomorrow!
Thanks, but I always say the reverse: 'Don't be happy. Worry.'
Here, you look like you need one
Bottoms up and may I be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows I`m dead
It's not like another beer is going to kill you...
This one's for you, Steve.
Are you trying to cheat me again, Larry?
Thanks but I was gonna drink that anyway after killing you.
- Take Sam Adams first!
Hey Pal, quit being so grim and have a beer: Life is too short! It's on me.
It's a harsh world, man - have a beer.
Joke's on you, I wanna die from alcohol poisoning.
If you can’t beat em’ join em’
Hand me another bear. My job is just killing me!
Thanks, but I never drink and death.
Last call for more than just alcohol.
You said one for the road now your getting carried away.
Thanks, I could use a cold one. This job's a killer.
Aw,come on,man....don't let her get you down...Life's a bitch.
I can't, it goes right through me.
Aw, c'mon, one beer ain't gonna kill ya."
Thanks. I’ll get your last one.
Have a drink to soothe your frazzled nerves.
Is it gluten-free?
Sure, I'll have one for the road
Why the grim face?
Thanks, I almost missed last call.
I would love to join you, but we will be seeing you soon enough.
C'mon. What've you got to lose?
Ah, come on...one beer’s not gonna kill you.
No -- here's looking at /you/.
Face it, pal, she stood you up. How about a beer?
Meet your boilermaker.
Come on – one more won’t kill you!
C’mon pal, one for the road won’t kill us.
We'll drink to your...health.
Thanks, but I can't; the boss would kill me.
Why so grim? Have a brewski.
It's time you live a little!
L'chaim! Or...whatever.
You sure you won't change your mind?
What about just one more for the road?
ok one more, but then we really must get to work.
Thanks for the drink, death.
What's your poison?
Just one more before we hit the road.
No thanks. Drinking and scything don't mix.
Hey Joe, had another bad day huh?
How's life treating ya?
Have one .... a beer will wipe that grim right off your face
I don't care how evil she is, I can't switch to your ex-wife.
What do you mean "Just one beer never killed anyone"?
Thanks, but my liver's been acting up lately.
You the designated driver??
None for me, thanks. I'll be driving later.
Here, you look thirsty!
Thanks for the beer, but you really should let me get you something.
It'd be more useful if that scythe was a mop.
it"s one for my baby and one for the road.
You look like you need this.
You'll have to wait...the first drink is to taxes.
"It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place--except you and me..." Musical notes dispersed??
Didn't you hear? They're finally going to repeal ObamaCare!
Thanks, but I've had enough heads for one day.
Come on, cheer up. It's happy hour!
No thanks, that stuff can kill you. Speaking of..
Thanks, but I never drink while I'm on duty. (I entered the same one last night but it was not confirmed)
No thanks, I prefer REDRUM.
sure , Im just killin time before the dead concert.
This one's on me. I've got someone I'd really like you to meet.
They’ve gotten serious about collections here.
It's a Zombie -- two parts rum, one part pentothal.
Aw, c'mon, one beer won't kill ya.
Well, here’s another year shot to hell!
How did you get that through security?
I'm having two, heard it was last call.
LIGHTEN UP, IT CAN'T BE ALL THAT BAD, HAVE A BEER ON ME.
What's it gonna be, Pal, a beer on me or me on a bier?
Nice to meet you, Reaper! What do you say we kill this year with a cold one?
You look like you need one. Cheer up!...this one's on me.
Join me...one for the road.
Here, have a cool one. You look like death warmed over.
Steve! Have a cold one!
Oh, what the hell, it's not like I'M the one who's driving tonight!
Wait'll you taste this one, Fella - you'll sing a different tune, I betcha!!
No, that's "skoal".
See, it’s not last call yet!
No thanks, I'd feel better if you had it.
Skip the thanks and drink up, I've got a quota to meet.
Here, my coping mechanism is smoother than yours.
Last call, Pal?
Grim Reabeer... nope, haven't heard that one before.
Thanks but beer just kills me.
Thanks, but Happy Hour ended five minutes ago.
Do you come here often?
Have another one. It won't kill ya.
Well, he's gone now. Care to join?
My name is “Destiny”
Sorry, I don't drink and scythe.
No thanks I left my mop at home.
Yes, it's definitely happy hour
I always thought that death would be the one making the deal with me.
Have one for heaven's sake!
Here -- this'll give me time to finish my own!
Here's not looking at you kid
Here, it'll put hair on your bones.
All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's?
I wanted to be too late for Happy Hour.
I know, work can be murder. So tonight, drink up and remember there's always tomorrow.
You’ve seen “The Princess Bride,” right?
I should warn you alcohol tends to make me aggressive.
You could probably use this, you look like you're dead on your feet.
No, thanks. This one's on me.
Last call for alcohol.
"Here, this will life the spirit!'
Can I tempt you?
Have one on me. See you soon!
I never drink while I'm working.
No thanks, I’m trying to lose a few pounds.
No thanks, I’m already feelin’ no pain.
One for The Reaper
Aw, come on. Just a taste. It won't kill you.
There are 97 more where this came from.
Hey, will it kill you to have a little fun?
To life, to life, l'chaim, eh?
Alright, one more. Then we have some business to attend to.
If I hear "Baby It's Cold Outside" one more time, I'm going to kill someone.
No, I don't play chess. How 'bout a beer?
Last call, you want one?
Man, I'd kill for a beer right now.
Sure come join me, I was just killing time!
Can I get a mop with that?
Only one more.....I promise!
I'll join you for one--maybe two--as soon as my shift is over.
Thanks but two Zombies is my limit.
Happy Hour? More like "Last Call."
Two won't kill me, right??
Well then, how 'bout a Lite beer. Tastes great - Less killing.
Don't look so grim. Have a beer.
Here, Take it! It won't kill you!
You're welcome. It's the last drink you'll ever have thanks to my one-step program.
'Ya know, msis, you're looking cuter and cuter!
One won't kill you.
Yes, I always have 2 for the road." "Why do you ask ?
I really shouldn't. But that winter ale is to die for.
Thanks, but I didn't bring a designated rider of the Apocalypse.
So, you die around here?
C’mon just one more for the road.
No thanks , its not good for my health
Before you take me, have a beer on me from my Bitcoin profits.
Here ya go, Mueller ... you need this more than me!
Thanks, but I'm doing the 6 o'clock news tonight on PBS.
No thanks, those go right through me but you enjoy them, it's last call.
Um, is that a literal or a metaphorical 'road' you're talking about?
Thanks, but I'm in the middle of a cleanse.
A cold one? You're speaking my language, man.
No thanks, I can't hold my beer.
No, thanks. I am going to be your designated driver this evening.
And then I said, "Why not and ordered two..."
Well...I guess we have time for one before we go.
This beer is going to be the death of me.
How about one for the trip down
Pick your poison.
Cold one?
I see a Grim Reaper from Kent, whose scythe is convincingly bent. Raise one last beer with me, for its easy to see that my time is obviously spent.
Come a little closer.
Oh, why not? I suppose one more won't kill me.
Oh... it must be the last call.
Have one on me, Mister, because the 8th time I cheated death is an even longer tale...
I said fear me, not beer me!
You might as well - it's two-for-one special today anyway.
With all that 2nd Amendment overtime your working, who deserves a brewski more than you, right?
Can I buy you a bier?
"No thanks.... remember, you're my designated driver"!
Thanks, but I only drink Zombies.
To the future of our planet...
Halloween is over, have a beer.
Just one. I am your designated driver.
Thanks. I made a killing today.
My holiday isn't 'til next week.
Sure - I guess we have time for that.
It’ll put meat on your bones
No thanks. I’m the designated reaper tonight!
"Here, you're gonna need this pal, 'Sean Hannity' is on in five minutes"!
I don't drink and arrive.
No thanks, goes straight through me.
Come on, one more. Before you cut me off.
No, I'm not the guy who wrote the fairy tales you remember as a kid.
No thanks, you drink mine, I want to get out of here early.
Retire? Sure. Wage stagnation, paltry pension- now they're gutting Medicare. You reap what you sow.
C'mon don't look so grim, just weed it and reap.
Relax, pal! Everyone will die one day.
Like you say, stranger — a couple of beers never killed anybody.
Drink up. There's only domestics where you're going.
Would you like a nice cold one?
Sadly for you Dom, I wouldn't technically be drinking before work.
Why the grim look, stranger? Have a bier on me.
It's to die for.
Here's one for the roadkill.
Drink up.....Last call!
Have one on me for the road to Samera.
Thanks pal, but beer goes right through me, and more importantly, you don't have time to finish it.
Cheers for the Reaper, now not looking so Grim!
You can have it. It's last call.
Have one before helping my people with the impeachment.
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE YOU NEED THIS WAY MORE THAN ME!!
Did someone say last call?
Yes, let's drink "To Death"!
Thanks, buddy. My friend Taxes will pay you back.
I can't say anything about skin but it'll sure put hair on your chest.
I swear Frank, you'll be the death of me.
No thanks. Goes straight to the hips.
I'll go after this round. Here! I got you the one with pumpkin spice.
Happy hour's over, pal. It's later than you think.
I can understand why you think I'm him. This holiday sale has everyone a bit tipsy.
C'mon-have one just for the Hell of it.
Thanks for the heads-up for last call.
You realize what this means, don't you?
Here's to better times
Pay it forward.
No, I'm ready! But first, how 'bout a little "waste not, want not" !
No thanks, I'm trying to cut down on alcoholics.
Well, hey, Life is short, right? Cheers!
Yeah, man my days been hell too
Aw come on, buddy! One beer won't kill you.
No it's OK. I'm just here for Budweiser.
You did say your would die for a cold beer, no?
"One more for the road will not kill you pal"!
You look dead on your feet ... this one is on me!
I've been waiting your arrival. Have a drink with me first!
Man, you look like death warmed over pal, have a beer on me.
I'll buy you a beer if you'll wait till tomorrow"
Do I have time for two?
Yes we can celebrate. The winter is finally here.
Yeah well you’re not looking so good yourself.
Ice cold, just the way you like it.
No thanks. I don't want to look like we're in another one of those New Yorker cartoons about the grim reaper.
No thank you. I don't take bribes.
Welcome to the watering hole; we all hit the end of the road here. You're one of many.
No thanks, friend. I'll just wait for you to have them both.
Here's to the great news from my eye doctor!
Cheer up, buddy – I'm sure they'll get the countdown right next year.
2017, am I right?
Sure I'll drink to your health, just not in a good way.
Join me! what doesn't kill me makes me stronger
If you're going to order a beer, I suggest you also order a mop.
Cheers, bub. But if I were you, I'd re-think that outfit. There are farmers in this area who would kill for a good scythe.
''Last drinks on me ! I know your working Morty, but one ain't gonna kill ya is it ?"
Won't you at least have a drink with me first?
Hell, yes.
I draw the nice guy at happy hour. Typical.
Thanks. I could use a cold one.
Have one. It's good for the soul.
I thought you were due to show up at my watering hole. Lets have a last one for the road to hell.
Have one - it’ll calm those nervous hesitations.
Thanks for the beers sweetie, but right now I'm way too drunk & broke to buy 'that farm' you're pushing.
I just have a few questions about my contract...
Here, have a beer on me since this is the last call.
It'll put hair on your chest!
You think I've never heard the 'one for the road' routine?
Thanks, I could use another mug.
Hey, do I have time for a few more? It's dollar mug night!
All right, just one more. But we'll be toasting your liver's cirrhosis.
No I'm sorry I can't drink with you. Tonight I'm the designated reaper.
Behold I am become Death, the destroyer of IPAs.
Don't look so grim. Come, have a drink with me.
Thanks. Actually my shift is almost over and then I'll take both.
A long life and good health? Try again.
That's right buddy, here's to the failure of Obamacare!
To the ultimate buzz-kill.
Let's hoist one for old times sake before the last call.
Nah, I can't drink that stuff. It goes right through me.
No thanks, too hard to remain grim.
I terminate Twitter accounts.
Don't tell me - You are here to make the 'world great again"
Hey, Pal! No offense, but your looking like death warmed over! Here, have one on me....
To your non-health!
Last call. Forever.
Must be my lucky day. How many guys carry a beer foam scraper around with them?
Ben Franklin said "death takes no bribes". But like any sane man, he is always down for a drink.
No thanks. I don't drink anymore. It goes right through me....
No thanks. Beer goes right through me.
Celebrate the old year; after all, this is a necrobrewery.
First time I've ever seen you, mate.
I'm actually trying to quit - things are going pretty well for me these days.
You look like you could use a drink.
One beer won't kill you.
Long day, Mr. Mueller?
I'm pretty sure we haven't met before.
Oh, no. You know, that stuff can kill you.
Thanks but no thanks, makes me wet my pants!
Join me for last call?
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
Still drinking lite I see.
This one's on me. L'chiem!
Here's mud in your scythe!
I promise it wont kill you
Thanks, but I need to take a few people home tonight.
I hope you have a designated syther!
Anyone with a fancy horse named Repeal is OK by me, Mr. Replace.
Have we met before?
Drink this before it's too late.
C'mon, lighten up! Someone's got to do it.
Come on, pal. Let's have a drink for the better days to come.
Got some time to spare?
Aw, come on. Just one beer. What could it hurt?
I don't care where I go, but I can't stay here.
Come on, it's last call
Ah, not to worry. It's gluten free. Stay a while.
Dang! Year end close must be rough.
My brand is spelled B-I-E-R
Thanks, but I never drink and scythe.
Have another one while we’re waiting for the asteroid.
yeahh.. let me finish my drinks first
I better stop or I'll wake up in the morning feeling like me.
I knew you were coming.
It's 2 for 1 night--come reap the rewards!
What’s the hurry? I’m buying.
It wouldn't kill you to have one.
What? It's gonna kill ya'?
I'm not here for a long time, I'm here for a good time.
Cheers to bad health.
Live long, and prosper, buddy.
Here's to The End.
Death, you've had a busy year so I'm buying.
Last call! Your meter is about to expire.
How about one more round before you put me underground?
"try a true craft Beer. It's a whole new way of life".
Hey buddy, let’s drink to our health!
Two beer or not two beer; that is the question. That joke just kills me!
No days off? Me neither buddy. A toast to the working stiff.
no, thank you. i'm working. what's your name, friend?
It's new on tap. They call it Quietus.
To my ex-wife.
L'Chaim?....I think you have me confused with someone else.
"Last call!" "You reap what you sow." "L'chaim." "You can't take it with you." I've heard them all. Just drink up - I'm double parked.
What do you say we have one last one together!
No thanks, I'm your Designated Driver. Feel free to have one for the road, though....
Sure. It's been too long since I took a holiday.
Cheer! You just passing?
You can't go home, but you can't stay here.
Thanks anyway - I have an Appointment in Samarr-A-Lago.
Why so grim, pal? Drink this beer. Life is short.
Well, I guess I'll have one but you better get me a mop.
Here you go mate, looks like your dying for a beer
Drink up--it's your last call.
Please taste test it for me so I won't be poisoned.
Thanks, but I don't drink while I tweet.
Here's to 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
Come on - one beer won't kill you!
I used to be just like you.
I bet you can't finish em' both!
No thanks, I'm driving, but you go ahead.
Relax. You got to do what you got to do.
Wait 'till the heating system gets repaired...
Trust me, you'd be better off hoisting one for your liver.
Naw, man. I've got to many DUIs.
Y'know, Baby, the lighting in here really brings out your cheekbones!
Everyone look's better at closing time
Let's drink to my health!
No thanks, I'm scything.
No thanks, gotta run. I'll meet you at the tree of your last DUI.
One more for the road? Sure, it won't kill me.
C’mon! It’s good for what ails ya’
Don't worry, friend. I never drink & scythe.
Must have been a hard day, pal. You look a little anemic.
No, Bill, I'm actually a bill collector.
Do I look like that kind of girl to you?
Hey! Why the grim look? Have a beer fella.
Dude. You reap what you sow.
Don't touch the stuff myself, shortens my swing.
No thanks. It's hard to be grim on a beer buzz.
Thanks, but I'm on the clock - and you're out of time.
No thanks, I am on the job.
Heck, why not? You've still got time somewhere.
Thanks, pal. It's nice to get a warm welcome once in a while.
If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.
I'll trade you a beer today for my life tomorrow.
Reap what you grim, friend.
Still trying to get that Bill through, are you? Well, here's another one on the House.
You're a real life saver... God, I love irony.
Thanks, anyway - beer goes right through me.
OK you can stay, but only until closing time.
Thanks! These craft beers are expensive.
This one's yours if you promise to send me up not down.
You need a drink...you look like death warmed over!
No thanks, i'm afraid it will just go straight through me.
Hey, it's happy hour. Take a holiday.
Come and join me, we might as well get snockered one more time!
I gotta go. One for the road?
Clearly, you don't enjoy your work. Let's drink to exploring new options!
Thanks...As long as I don't have to say "To your health".
How about one more fo r the long hall?
Here, have another. I can wait.
Here, service is very slow.
Before you kill me, let's have some beer
Here, my friend. You look a little dry.
Drink up. You don't need to worry about walking out of here.
You look like you can use one for the road.
no pressure...
This beer is dead. You can have it.
Thanks for helping me out with my wife
Offered in the spirit of not being a good intention.
I guess you’re right—it’s not too late to live a little
Ok, but just the one.
Aaaw, c'mon, buddy! One little drink won't...well...ya know...
Thanks, I wouldn't mind a beer. But I also need a mop.
Hey there big guy - wanna join our Quidditch beer pong team?
and then the guy says, "Now where's that old lady with the sore tooth?"
Yes, it's true, misery does love company.
Miss your quarterly quota again?
I've got friends in low places.
Hey, one beer won't kill you.
I can be certain about one thing, and that's you look like you need a drink.
Just curious...did you just listen to a motivational podcast?
Listen, I was just sort of kidding when I said I'd sell my soul for another beer.
Here, have a drink, you look like death
I’m afraid I partake only after ‘last call’.
Come on, man, one drink won't kill you.
S'ok--have one more. It actually is a long road.
Eat, drink, and be merry? Sounds good, this one's on me.
Here's to dying for you.
You're lucky it's Happy Hour.
Ok, just one. I’ve got Ok, just one. I have to get back to work.
This one's on me, pal. You look like death.
What about just one more for the road?
Thanks for meeting me. Have I got a deal for you.
Hey, beautiful, I don't care what the head of HR says about me, wanna beer?:
To a day off!
Grim reaper: No thanks, buddy. Beer goes right through me.
No thanks. I'm cutting back.
Thanks, but I never accept bribes.
No thanks. I'm on a die-it.
So, you’ll be filling in for the 2018 New Year’s baby?
Hey, pal, let's drink and be merry, eh, for tomorrow we...oh...uh, ignore me, I was just saying.
No thanks. The foam goes up my nose.
Can you skim the head off this?
No thanks, I don't have a liver.
No thanks. But I could use a ride --
Buy and HODL to the moon, right!?
Oh Thanks! Just don't tell the IRS that I accept bribes.
This will cheer you up!
Here's to making your quota this month!
I’d love to have one but I can’t drink on the job.
Kinda dead in here, huh?
You can afford another beer now that your tax has been repealed.
Here's hoping your on holiday.
Bar Humbug!
You'd make one hell of a bouncer.
"The hour is getting late... Why not? I could kill for a beer, and you look half potted already," he said and looked around for a mop.
Here's to another 12-step reprieve, ya Rim Greaper!
How ironic.
Here's to the working dead!
Hey, you look like you need a drink!
What does a guy have to do to get a beer around here?
"What do you mean you don't drink when you're on the job?
Thanks, bud. I’ve had a killer week.
Here's blood in your eye!
No thanks. Have another for me...
I can't... I'm the designated scyther.
Stop trying to buy time.
Time for one last beer?
Come on over and have a drink. I used to be just like you
If that mug of Arrogant Bastard is mine, you got another fifteen minutes.
Thanks, but I’m a friend of Bill’s. Enjoy!
Cheers! Have one on me. But what brings you to this dump?
You put the Grin in Reaper.
Shall we celebrate the miserable demise of 2017 or the miserable dawn of 2018?
C'mon Steve, it's not that bad!
I'll drive.
No, I heard you. I said, "I am DEATH."
Care to try my healthcare plan?
She said she'd rather die.
Nah. I'm on Prozac.
Thanks Pete, and this will have to be your last round.
I guess it won't be the cirrhosis that gets me.
Pale Ale?
Have a cold one buddy. Looks like you could use it.
What's up, buddy? Why the grim face?
It actually makes biological sense to be an ephebophile or a teleiophile. You would want to have the youngest sexually mature mate possible in order to ensure the success of your genes. There is no biological justification for pedophilia.
Ask the barman for a mop and l,ll join you.
You look like you could use a beer!
JUST ONE MORE BEER BEFORE WE HEAD OFF.
Oh yeah? Hold my beer.
Have one on me. You know, the color black is making a comeback this year, and looks very becoming on you.
Thought you'd never show up. It's been a rough year.
Hi Mr. Bannon, back home again?
Why not? It's always last call somewhere.
Not so fast, I'm only brain dead
Drink to your heart, buddy. You won't die.
No, no, no. You drink it... I'll just wait
This one's for you, kid: Goodbye to the estate tax.
Hold that thought. I have something else in mind.
Need another cold one?
You look like you could use a little 'pick-me-up'.
Thanks, buddy - but I really like mine dark.
You moron, stop spilling it! I barely had enough change to cover that one!
Want some spirits???
Thanks for the free one, but joke’s on you. I took an Uber.
Drink up! You look too grim.
If it's cold you've caught me.
Never touch the stuff. It'll kill you.
Thanks, but I never drink when I'm on duty.
I don't know why they keep hiring these guys. They never last more than a day.
C'mon...one more's not gonna kill ya.
He won't last one day.
And One For The Road
Why the grim face? Here, have a beer on me.
The end of happy hour incarnate.
Cheers?
Give me a second, one more and i'll be right with you!
Believe me, I need to retire, but I'm afraid the boredom would be deadly.
It's apple juice with a froth topping.
I just love draft beer to death, don't you?
Let's toast to meeting deadlines
If you are starting a new dress code,you got my vote Buddy
Do I want a beer? Is this some kind of joke?
No thanks. Buzzed killing is drunk killing.
Hi, gorgeous ! Come here often ?
Come on! One more beer never killed anybody!
Hard day at the subway? Take it.
I don't care if you are a friend of my ex-wife. This round's on me.
Suds in your ... errr, eye sockets.
No thanks. It goes right through me.
No thanks, I’m on the clock.
Wow, these things go right through you.
It's Miller's time.
Great Halloween outfit! Come have one on me - I don't have to be anywhere.
You shouldn't be drinking those...you're the Designated Dier...
Wait. You’re here for me?
It's all right, he'll put on my tab.
Sorry, pal, haven't seen democracy today. How 'bout a cold one?
Thanks, pal. Here's t' long life!
One won't hurt you.
No thanks. That stuff runs right through me.
Care to share a beer and a few stories?
Here...kill this instead.
No thanks! I don't want a DWI - Death While Intoxicated.
First, let's drink to the life I had.
Sorry, I'm not allowed to accept gifts.
Consider this as the first in a continuing series of buy-offs.
Cheers buddy. See you again tomorrow for Happy Hour.
I know I’m your designated driver, but just let me finish this last one.
No thanks.That stuff goes right thru me.
No thanks, I don't drink on the job.
To the success of my new funeral home.
Live a little and have a brewski on me.
Cheers, Grimmy, and scythe's the limit!
No thanks, I'm on a 'no carbs' diet.
Just have one. It won't kill ya.
I'd rather have a Bloody Mary. I feel like death from last night.
The year is dead! Long live the year!
I feel a bad about betting a beer on it. I already knew Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly were in the same plane crash.
You can't bribe me, especially not with that brand.
Thanks, buddy. I've had a hell of a year!
Here's mud in your eye-socket!
Here's to you...take my mother-in-law, OK?
So, this guy who walks into a bar with a scythe...
Happy hour is a man made myth.
Why yes, this second one is for that road. Why do you ask?
Welcome back to the left, Reaper.
I'd say l'chaim, but...
You look like you could use a drink.
Your a dead ringer for my brother -in - law.
Sorry I’m gluten free!
Trust me, you'd be better off wishing your liver good health!
You know that song, 'A Thousand Bottles of Beer on the Wall.'
Thanks. I can drive you to your final destination.
Okay you can drink that one too but then Ima kill you.
Ok- one more but you’d better call your wife and tell her you’ll be late.
Okay fine... here's mud in MY eye.
Have a beer. It's really dead tonight.
Join me, you look parched!
Thanks, pal. But not while I'm on duty.
One for my baby and one more for the road
I just know you're dying to have a beer.
Man, what are you doing here?
We'll see who has the hollow leg.
Trust me, my friend. Have a few of these and you're mind will be in a better place.
Have a beer and you won't be so grim.
Thank you but no, I'm driving home.
I said: "This is NOT a happy hour!"
I'd offer you a "hair of the Dog," but I see I'm too late.
Ok, Mr. Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, I'd like you to meet my good friend Stein, Ms. Gertrude Stein, that is.
Try it it won't kill ya
The new guy? He won't make it past spring.
Sure, I'll take a cold one.
You're in for a real hangover.
How much more time will a beer buy me?
She left me a note but I can't find it.
You look thirsty
Have a Halloween Ale. It’s a real killer!!
It's not so bad down here eh, mate?
It may be last call but I say you've had enough.
This one is on me. I've heard there are no Bars on the other side.
In heaven there is no beer, that's why we drink it here.
Thanks, but I don’t have time for one more, but you do.
A near-death experience calls for a celebration.
You look like you need it, now just stay down there, WAY down there...
If you think you can buy more time with a cold beer, you're absolutely right.
I don’t negotiate! Finish the two beers and let’s hit the road!!
I can't have one - I'm working.
You want my head? Mate, you can have it!
Hi, have a drink. My friends say you can help me beat the tax system.
I hear that beer is to die for.
Is this a joke?
Cheers man! At least I won't have to worry about a DUI ticket tonight.
Here's to the Trump election anniversary!
Why won't you drink with me? Give me a ghost of a chance.
Here's hoping your next job's easier than the last one.
Trust me, one more won't drown you.
No no, the good place does not carry any IPA's.
Awesome! I live for cold brewskis!
Here, mate. Put some flesh on your bones.
The phrase-bottoms up- was about to change.
One more and then we drive home.
Might as well tax one of my beers as well.
Have a cold one! That's what I'm here for.
Is it my turn to buy the beer or my turn to go to hell?
A Brewery Home Companion
Thanks. I could go for a bier.
And they say they don't serve beer in hell.
Shmuze me Miss, I’ll give you a ride home right after I finishhhh theze.

You look a little grim. Here. My treat. Have one for the sowed...
Hey, great stuff on SNL.
Join me, Pal. This joint is dead this afternoon.
Have one for the road. It won't kill you!
Every time an alcoholic orders himself a drink...
You look parched.
So you want to have one last drink with me before you hit the road.
No thanks but you have time to finish yours.
Funny, most people try to buy me corpse reviver.
Sure. I'll join you for last call.
Tax bill proponents celebrate its passage.

I've got the next round.

Have you ever heard about this book, War & Peace? I could tell you about over a cold beer.
Man, at this drinking rate, I won't have much left to do...
Thanks, but I thought the AMA said yes to two beers a day?
Here's looking at you, kid.
I'm here to pick you up. You'll need both of those.
Hey man, it looks like you need one.
Drink up - you can't live forever.
No thanks, I already had a bier.
You look like Death warmed over, better have one of these.......
You go ahead and have it, I've got three more pick ups after you.
You go ahead. I'm waiting for a friend.
Thanks! but no thanks! You need both drinks so you can be taken away safely to the other side.
Try this one. It's called Surprise Ending.
I usually blow the froth off, but if you want to give it a try...
C'mon, a quick one to celebrate all your successes this year!
Drink up my friend. They just announced last call.
Here you go, Bud, live a little!!
No thanks. I don't drink when I'm on the job.

No thanks, I'm driving tonight. Just like you.
You’ll be the death of me!
That's right, it's good for you. It's gluten-free, low-carb T'weason'ale. Please have another one on me for the road.
The later it gets, the better you look.
I will be finished in a moment. Would you go warm up the car for me?
Cheer up man, why so pale?
You sure did us part. Here's to you dude!
Come on mate, one for the road?
ya’ know - if you lose the sickle, people might see you’re not such a bad guy after all
No thanks. If I drink a beer that cold I might catch my death
How about the study that 2 drinks daily would prolong your life@
Don't look so grim. This one's on me.

Thanks. I was just thinking that I would die for another beer.
I'm glad to see you've chosen your poison.
May I go in peace.
Congratulations on the President's endorsement of your candidate, Steve!
It's my own special blend of hops and reaped souls.
Dark Stout or Helles Bock?

Wow, I didn't know the Grim Reaper liked Beer!
It appears I don't have time for two?
Let's have one last one and call it a night.

I say this is the one you put the poison in.
Congrats Steve - you made it out of The White House!
No, the other one.
No rush-have a drink
Last one standing? I don't play chess.
Grief is a hard thing to get by

Man:“You’re just in time for last call!” Grim: “As are you...”
Hey! Whet your sickle??

Another round before you put me in the ground?
Beer's on me, if you just take my liver.
I didn't expect you during happy hour, but have one on me, and we'll make the best of it.
Twins
"You've been looking for me?! I've been looking for you!"?
From the looks of things, you could use this more than me.

No, you won't have to pay the tab.
Are you the liver transplant surgeon?

You're not you when you're thirsty...have a White Zombie.
No thanks. I don't drink when I'm on the job.
Do you take requests?
Okay, I got your point.
We can't leave. I bought you one, then you buy me one, then I buy you, then your turn...see, bar etiquette.
Thanks, but it just goes right through me.
Have a drink. I know that you are unhappy with your thankless job.
Yeah, I'd rather not, I died last time.

Thanks-I never drink when I'm still on scything duty, but I'll take care of both of them in a minute.
This one's on me; that new AI ruined chess for me as well.

If 2016 isn't going to drive you to drink, I don't know what will

Actually, I want you to have both
Oh sure, what the heck? I'm tired of wrestling with my conscience.
That new seasonal hire is so flaky, she doesn’t have a nose for sales, and her smile is totally fake.
I am going to offer you a drink but I expect you to deny it because I don't want to waste a fine liqueur.
No thanks, they go right through me.
I gave you 3 extra years and you're offering me lite beer?
It is hard to be a god.
They told me at the AA Meeting that I should strangle you and stuff you in a toilet.
It's a Creamted Ale
Let's give your thing a try
One and on your road, ok?
No Thanks; I'm driving.
Thanks for the beer! Now, what did you want to talk to me about?
Awake from your barley and meet your Reaper.

His approval rating are worse than mine!
Of course he's always happy--he's a typical guy that keeps the thermostat below freezing.
You here for the nuclear showdown also?
Let's drink to Death!
How did you know I came from a dry county?
I wish we had time for that, but I'm working.
Thanks for the beer. This changes nothing you realize.

Okay, how about a game of chess?
No thanks. I'm on duty and be caught on a DDUI (death deciding under the influence) charge.
You look parched.
Working hard during the holidays? This drink will cheer you up.
Oh, what are you griping about? I'm still on this end of the bar.
You baby boomers are always expecting me and frankly it's freaking me out.
Here, have a beer, it'll cheer you up.
At least you don't have to worry about the Surgeon General's warning.

It's a black lager, you'll like it.
No thanks. That's your one-too-many!
Bartender, can I return this one?
Thanks, but, why don't you drink it instead? Then I can get home sooner.
Can I extend this offer to you - a free beer every time you see me?
No, thanks, I'm ordering a Corpse Reviver.
Yeah, you're right, blood-alcohol levels be damned!
Thanks, but just because HR won't let me touch people anymore doesn't mean I'm gonna start drinking on the job.
Holiday overtime like the rest of us?
Just take it — I’m not here to judge you.
Might as well join me, eh?
Next? Democracy. A New Yorker is trying to help me but keeps misfiring into his foot.
No thanks. I prefer something much less cheerful.
You're on my watch. They call me the "Grim Peeper."
This should help your parched throat.
Is the first step ‘admit you have a problem’ or ‘denial’?
No, [em]you[/em] have a [em]bier[/em].
Mister D, sit and have a drink with me. I got kicked by a Moscow Mule and paid under the table.

Oh perfect! Now you can give this one to Fred!
Are you asking me out?
It's okay, you can 'beer' the reaper.

One for the road indeed.
My treat pal. You're here for the "Buzzard Breath Ale" on tap. Right? ... Right?

Thanks for the beers, but what are you getting out of it?
C'mon, suck down a couple, get in touch with your lighter side.
Thanks, but I don't drink while I'm on duty.
Well they ran out of whisky, but I figure you drink enough beer and this won't hurt a bit.
Last call, friend. Here's to the Waste Land!
One for my buddy and one for the road
Why, thanks, I will. I'm the designated driver this evening.
I am coming. But it will be better with beer.

Before you have one on me, have one on me.

You should have brought a mop.
Nice costume pal. Wanna beer?
I appreciate your thoughts, but I don't care for taxes.

Hey, bub, you look like you could use a drink.
I like to vote for the candidate with whom I'd most like to have a beer.
Sorry honey, I still can't find the to do list.
Thank you, but I only drink vodka and arsenic.
Take it, really. Pretty sure I’ve already had one too many.
Take this, and the hearse you rode in on.
Sure, thanks. I could use a little Holiday cheer.
My nagging wife says that if I keep this up, I will drink myself to death. So, Cheers!

Sorry, last call. No exceptions.
Bad news. They are going to need a mop for you, too.
I'm glad the surgery went well.
Too bad I forgot my beer comb.
No thanks; I was really hoping you would have ordered some food.
You know we're not supposed to dink, being Muslim
I'm the one for the road, not your baby.
Now, you'll have to pardon me because I've been sitting here all day, but are you Conquest, Famine or War?
I guess now that the bartender’s gone, I’ll get you your beer.
Excuse me while I level the heads.
Thanks, but I gotta say, 'Pass.'
Swish the top off this one Reapie.
If I drink that it goes straight to my feet.

What happened to the bartender?
Nice Costume

Okay, one more... but only if you promise not to call a cab.
It's a speed-date with Me Too.
Well, if this is last call, then have one on me!
No thanks, I better not. For the life of you, I can't even remember why I came in here.
Drink up working that hard would put you in a early grave.
Have a cold one. Let's drink to life.
Here. I want to buy my round before Famine and Pestilence get here.
'Silent Night' ... ten minutes.
I don't drink beer, but can I interest you in a nice burial plot?
What do you think I have a mop at the end of this sychthe?

Happy Halloween!
Fine, but we'll need a mop after.
Have one more beer and you want feel a thing.

You look like you could use a drink or two.
The seasons al workers are back!
The holidays are hard for all of us. Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, but statistically I only have 1.8 seconds... and... gotta go!
Don't be so sad, after all you could be called "The Grim Raper"!

How about a beer, friend? You look a bit grim.
And take one for the road, on the house.
Pardon me, but does your t shirt say, "I'm Only Here for the Beer!"?
Don't take it personally. I said the same thing to Comey ... that guy fires everyone!
Given how things are going, how about you drink one, I drink one, you drink one, I drink one -- until we're both dead.
Come on. Let's be friends.

Why the frowny face? Here. Have one for the road.
Cold beer? happy drunks are always cleared.
Wish I could join you but I don’t have a stomach for it anymore. Besides, that stuff will be the death of you.
I'm pleased to see that you are as accustomed as I am to the pleasures of a frosty mug.
Have a beer before I have to go.
Sure mister, I'll have one more.
You need a break. Have a beer on me"
And here's one for you, to take away that gloom and doom!

Plant is your bony butt down on the stool, Chief, and this cold brewski is what you shall reap.

Might want to grab a mop. Looks like this beer might go right through you...
I want to be on good terms with you whom we must all meet one day!

Have a beer on me. Next year I won't be able to afford it.
What's a cute girl like you doing in a place like this?
No thanks, beer just runs right through me.
Alcohol is doing better in the "Death" business than me. 5.9%. I used to be good, but then obesity came in.
I appreciate the offer, but you won't beactually needing the other one either.
Well, given how things have gone this year, I'll just finish these two and then I'll be right with you.
Thanks-let's celebrate that I'm the only thing left.
No thanks. I have to visit a client's mother-in-law in an hour.

Thanks, but I'm just getting a slice
Today's my birthday!
Apparently, the next one's on me.
Well, yeah...I guess, technically, I will be your designated driver.
Thanks for your service, bro. I wish I could've been there with you. But my bunions really hurt.
"You look like Death warmed over. Join me in a bier"?
Sure, you can have one...but what's it worth to you?
It's last call. Have a beer on me
Don’t be proud. Let me buy you one for the road.
Free beer for my skoal?...You got a deal.
This one YOUR CRAFT?
One more for the road, thanks, Devil.
I'll see ya' in 10.
-oh life...you came for me.
I gotta tell ya, Vern, you're a forgiving guy.
Oh, c'mon! One drink won't kill ya.
Had a rough night?
Hey Buddy, wanna drink?
No thanks. The last round killed me.
Thanks. I used to reap barley, but it lacked grimness.
I can just imagine the headlines when someone finally blows the whistle on me.
SHARE A BEER WHILE WE WAIT FOR JOHN?
Sorry, that stuff goes right through me
No, thanks. My doctor put me on a no-carb diet.
Remember to live!
It’s called Bjørn Ågaån Bier. Changes your whole life and it’s easier, for me, than chess.

OK, I bet ya !
Would it be possible to have a beer summit before....?
Does the foam still tickle?

Here's one for the road, but take your time
Happy Halloween!
Thanks, but I've got an appointment and beer just runs right through me.
1. Happy now, Mitch? 2. Just tell when when you're done Mitch....oh, I'm next?
It's on me - it'll help knock the edge off. New in these parts?
Ordinarily I'd say no thanks, but I guess a little root beer never hurt anyone.
Is the beer bottomless too?
Alright then, there'll be a bowl of pretzels.
No thanks, I'd rather have a Left 4 Dead.
Let's have one on me before I go.
I appreciate the gesture, but what I said is I'd kill for a bier / No thanks, there's beer, and then there's bier / Thanks, but this is last call / No thanks, I never drink on the job.
Have a Bud Life ?
If you lie down with dogs, you get fleas.
C'mon, a cold beer for the scythe
Trump getting you down as well?
My rosy cheeks and lips faded long ago. Care for a beer, fool?
Thanks, but I’ll have to pass. This gluten free diet is just killing me.
Let go for a bot! No bot can give the personal touch you gave it.
I'd figured you of all people would appreciate a 2 for 1 special.
Thanks, but I only drink micro- boos.
#you too?
Have one. It won’t kill you.
Oh ok, after all the 'so called' surgeon general says it only 'may'... cause health problems.
You like the stuff on tap? Well, have I got a tap for you!
Have another. Afterall, you only live once.

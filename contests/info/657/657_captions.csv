Fortunately, our time is up.
I think we can end on that note.
I'm more of a pop psychologist.
This is New York. You may often hear a discouraging word.
Get over it. You're not an old cowhand, you're Irving Goldstein from Brooklyn.
I think we need to face the possibility that she won't be comin' round the mountain
It's time to accept that she's never coming round the mountain.
And finally, "would you say that you're a man of (a) occasional, (b) frequent or (c) constant sorrow?"
When did you first notice this personality change Rabbi Friedman?
That lonesome whistle means our time is up.
When you said you'd pay for these sessions with Cash, I didn't think you meant Johnny.
We'll end on that note.
Have you considered entering a two-step program?
Don’t think of them as discouraging words so much as constructive criticism.”
You're rambling again.
Would you rather get back your truck, your dog, or your wife?
Who is "coming around the mountain," John?  Could it be your mother?
Let’s shoot for high noon next week?
I'm hearing some discouraging words.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how lonesome are you?
Well, it’s High Noon. See you next week.
I'ts not uncommon for men of your age to start feeling fenced in.
You fret too much.
Let me guess: she got the gold mine and you got the shaft.
Well I prefer it to the week you thought you were James Brown.
I've seldom heard such discouraging words.
I'm writing you a prescription for guitar lessons."
So, let's talk about your dad, Sue.
I take it you are no longer Napoleon.
Did it ever occurr to you that you done her wrong first?
By chance, do you know "Forever Jung?"
That’s all for today, Sue.
I'm afraid an occasional  discouraging word is part of the treatment.
Well, our time's up. You can git along now.
Your problem is you fret too much
You've got to stop fretting.
High noon... afraid your time is up.
And when did you first start hearing those discouraging words?
In your case, I'm going to recommend the two-step rather than the twelve-step program.
So what is it this time - the girl, the truck, or the dog?
Well how often did you actually hear a discouraging word?
And on that note our time is done.
Maybe it's time you did hear a discouraging word
So, stay on your meds, and happy trails to you until we meet again.
Seldom have I heard such discouraging words.
Well, you're about to hear a discouraging word.
Being from El Paso is not a border line personality disorder
In here, the whole point is hearing discouraging words.
Sometimes a discouraging word is exactly what we need to hear.
It sounds like I've struck a chord.
Yes, I have to say, those are discouraging words.
You seem to fret a lot.
So, Sue, what brings you here?
Want to grab a rabbi and walk into a bar?
Who's trying to fence you in?
Soooo -- I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.
So you see, they're not 'booing.' That's just a normal cow noise.
Perhaps we could leave out the "and it goes a little something like this here" every time you respond to a question.
Well, maybe you wouldn’t be a man of constant sorrow if you’d just take the antidepressant I prescribed.
I don’t think you have depression. What you have is a hit single.
It's  just out of tune.  It's not your mother's fault.
So: happily married; sober; truck running smooth; dog came home; writer’s block. Got it.
Urging you to set boundaries is not the same as trying to fence you in.
Let’s end today’s session on a positive note.
Do you frequently hear discouraging words?
Would you describe your heart as achey, or more breaky?
Face it, nothing rhymes with oedipus.
Blame your mother all you want, but she told you not to grow up to be a cowboy.
You need music lessons, not therapy.
It's OK to use discouraging words.
And who are we today?
Now Sue, tell me where it all started.
Have you ever felt so lonesome you could cry?
You say your horse had no name. Was this a problem for the horse, or for you?
But the fact is your momma DID let you grow up to be one.
Apart from the deer and antelope, did you play with anyone else as a child?
You know, Jed, you may have to accept that she'll never come around the mountain.
I'm going to need more to go on than just the fact that you're so lonesome you could cry."
So, you've never felt at home on the range?
High noon again next week?
Yes, you seem depressed. I'm going to prescribe a banjo.
Well I must admit, that is a discouraging word.
To expect to "never" hear a discouraging word is delusional. To expect to "seldom" hear a discouraging word is quite sane.
Is it possible that you’re right-handed?
And those things roaming around on the range near your home, are they in the room with us now?
You never really felt at home on the range, did you?
Yes, It’s my job to listen.
Tell me, the discouraging words -- were they frequent?
It's okay to use discouraging words here.
I'm going to go ahead and assume there's an ex-wife somewhere in this.
It’s not that I don’t believe you - it’s just quite a coincidence that all your issues rhyme with each other.
I'm afraid you're about to hear some discouraging words.
These ghost riders in the sky. Do they talk to you?
So up until that point, you seldom had heard a discouraging word?
Let's just suppose she'll be riding six white horses when she comes.
I'm writing you a prescription for a banjo. That should cheer you up.
I am recommending a two-step program.
Ok, your wife left, and your dog died.  You need a third thing for it to be a country song, Bob
This is not exactly what I meant when I said that you should reinvent yourself, Mrs. Himmelman.
So, it all started when your father named you Sue.
Let’s talk about your father, Sue
First, let’s address the achy, then we can explore the breaky.
Let's focus on the cattle you didn't lose.
I hear discouraging words all day long.
OK.  So your Father named you Sue.
Therapy doesn't work well when seldom is
heard a discouraging word.
Be honest.  Was any time a good time for Lucille to have left you?
Maybe if you'd tune the damn thing you wouldn't be so lonesome all the time.
I have to tell you, Hank--Every week, it's the same sad song.
You realize my job is to listen to you and not sing-along.
And what was it like the first time you heard a discouraging word?
So tell me about the first time you heard a discouraging word.
Maybe you'd be happier outside of New York?
Nobody's looking to fence you in, Henry.
...and yet, your mother did let you grow up to be a cowboy. Tell me about her.
Anything you sing in here will be kept completely confidential.
No, it's not paranoia. You really are terrible.
On that note, your time is up.
Perhaps it's time you heard a discouraging word.
Well, we each have to face the discouraging word, regardless how seldom.
Let's end this session on a high note.
So Sue, tell me about your relationship with your father.
And just when did the skies become cloudy all day?
I can’t cure your compulsive pun disorder if you insist on starting each session with “Home on Derange.”
I could cure you, but then your career would be over.
Having seldom heard discouraging words has set you up for disappointment, I’m afraid.
So, when did you first start feeling so lonesome you could die?
So, as I understand it, you are so lonesome you could cry.
No, I don’t want to fence you in, I just need to know where to send the bill.
Seldom I've heard such discouraging words."
I prefer cash.
You must understand, Tex, that sometimes the skies ARE cloudy all day .
Have you considered changing your name, Sue?
How did it make you feel when you heard those discouraging words?
Now what made you feel that Goldman Sachs  was no longer the the place for you?
We'll just call you Oedipus Tex.
My question seems to have struck a chord.
Just nod when it's my time to come in.
So, you're hearing discouraging words and the skies are cloudy all day.
And do you think that there's a reason why all your Ex's are in Texas?
I feel like we ended on the wrong note last time.
So you say that you heard a discouraging word AND it was cloudy all day?
So your mama let you grow up to be a cowboy.  Get over it.
I think we established some years ago that you're an old cowhand from the Rio Grande. The real breakthrough will come when you can admit that you never saw a cow, never roped a steer, that you are in fact a corporate lawyer at a large Midtown firm.
Let's start with your early years. 
What was it like for a boy named Sue?
How seldom were the discouraging words?
So, let's start with that: your name is Sue?
Happy trails to you. You're time's up.
I know you've seldom heard a discouraging word but that's why we're here.
Mama didn’t LET you grow up to be a cowboy, you have to take some responsibility as well.
This is just a phase. You really should re-think leaving your law firm.
Let's start with a two-step program.
You really think you can go through life expecting to seldom hear a discouraging word?
And when did these voices start their discouraging words?
Now, when you say, 'You're so lonesome you could die," 
what do you mean, exactly?
When did you first hear discouraging words?
And how would you define "a discouraging word"?
Well I agree with you.  Discouraging words, even if seldomly heard, can still be hurtful.
But does the chord want to change?
I think the problem is that you’re right handed.
When she did not come around the mountain, how did that make you feel?
Now that we have got your guitar in tune, let's work on you.
When did you first suspect she would not be coming round the mountain?
Did you ever wonder WHY all your ex's live in Texas?
Now, play the first thing that comes to your mind...
Well, did you ever ASK the deer and the antelope to include you?
Yes, I'm afraid that IS a discouraging word.
And when did you start to hear these discouraging words?
I wish you had mentioned a year ago that 'Mama' is your guitar.
You seem a little flat this week.
I'm not going to be much help if you keep calling me 'stranger'.
It’s not you.  ‘Wyoming’ is a difficult rhyme.
So, you feel fenced in.
And these “discouraging words” are more frequent now?
I agree, those words are discouraging. But take comfort in the fact that they are seldom heard.
How does it make you feel that you can’t play the guitar, you are a lawyer and you’ve never been west of the Hudson River?
And when do you remember first hearing a discouraging word?
Well Slim, sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
And how frequent were these discouraging words?
I'm sorry but you're out of tune and we're out of time."
We all feel fenced in at times.
I think we have to consider this as an expression of hostility toward your Brooklyn roots, Moishe.
Perhaps it was seldom, but what discouraging words DID you hear?
So, you're so lonesome you could cry?
I'm sorry, but no amount of therapy can make you talented.
Even if it is seldom, how does that discouraging word make you feel?
So far, I have that your Mama don’t dance and your Daddy don’t rock and roll
I’m prescribing happy trails, until we meet again.
I'm sure the deer and the antelope didn't mean to exclude you.
Tell me more about your years at Juilliard.
What was the discouraging word?
I get it. You're lonesome.
Lucky for you I'm a leading practitioner of Western Psychology.
And when you shot a man in Reno just to watch him die ... how did that make you feel?
Now, I don't want you to think of these as discouraging words...
How about 'If  You've Got the Money I've Got the Time'?
You know the rules - we end on the hour, not when the song is over.
When did you first start hearing the discouraging words?
Aha, it sounds like we've finally managed to strike a chord.
I'm sensing some discord.
How frequently would you say you heard these discouraging words?
Well, even cowboys get the blues.
No, I don’t have a request.
Can we mosey back to your fear of intimacy?
And when did you start hearing these discouraging words?
I'm taking you off loco weed.
I'm prescribing a benzodiazepine and a tuning fork.
Just because your Mama let you grow up to be one, it's still your choice.
When did you start fretting?
I can't help you unless you accept the fact that it's "deer and antelope,"  not "beer and cantaloupe."
You say seldom. At what age do you recall having heard a discouraging word?
Please don't use that tone with me.
How often were you exposed to discouraging words?
Have you considered changing your tune?
First of all, that’s not a banjo on your knee.
So mama let you grow up to be a cowboy?
'You just don't have the range anymore.
Think of a time when you did feel at home on the range.
And how long have you been hearing discouraging words?
Can you tell me when the trails first stopped being happy?
That is still a discouraging word, even if you put it to music
The solution to your problem is simple: you're right-handed.
I’m pleased to see that you’re not fretting as much as you used to.
Why do you feel that I'm fencing you in?
And how long have you been feeling so lonesome you could cry?
And you heard this discouraging word often?
So you say this all started when you heard a discouraging word?
Do you want to start with the wife or the horse?
It's good we're ending this session on a high note.
It is my professional opinion that you've got a classic case of the Willies.
Hold that note. We will pick it up from here again next week.
So, did you hold them or fold them?
If you want my advice, you are going to have to change your tune
Well, how do you think that makes the horse feel?
I'm changing your prescription to a xylophone.
If you’re that lonesome, maybe you should cry.
And how did this discouraging word make you feel?
So, who am I speaking with today?
enough with the discouraging words
So when you shot a man in Reno just to watch him die, how did that make you feel?
She done you wrong...can you elaborate on that?
I can't help you.  You need to see a music teacher.
It's an impossible conflict. You want the little dogies to git along, but once they git along, you feel abandoned.
But is never hearing a discouraging word a reasonable expectation?
Just when did you start feeling so lonesome you could cry?
Tell me more about your cheatin' heart.
Is that "Home on Deranged"?
Waylon? Am I still speaking with Mr. Jennings, or am I speaking to Mr. Cash again?
You clearly fret too much.
So, do you want to be happier, or write better songs?
Why do YOU think the deer and antelope wouldn't play with you?
We would get a lot more done if you stopped repeating the chorus.
Let's think positively. Your wife took the truck and dog yet left the guitar.
So, you rode through the whole desert together, and the horse still wouldn’t tell you it’s name?
And on that note,we are all out of time!
Have you considered spending less time on the range?
And what was the discouraging word?
Okay, so you were walking down the streets of Laredo.  Then what?
I can't help but think you're not telling me everything. Is there another verse?
I think we should focus on WHY your wife left you, your dog died, and your truck broke down.
Either your mother, your dog or your pick-up truck. It can't be all three.
You've been expecting her to be coming' round the mountain for how many years?
And when did you first hear these discouraging words?
Let's go back to that part about your Dad naming you Sue.
When did you start feeling so lonesome you could cry?
Your progress over our 25 years together has reached a milestone. I think you're ready to add lyrics.
How seldom.
Well, it's high noon. Why don't we pick this up next week.
When we left off last week, you’d just gunned down your mother on the streets of Laredo.
And did the deer and antelope ever ask you to play?
How did it make you feel when the doggies refused to git along?
So, how often do you hear these discouraging words?
It's good that you did not shoot the deputy, but I have to report that you shot the sheriff.
Your hour is yippee-ti-yi-up.
I'll see you again next week at high noon.
On a scale of A-G#, how do you feel?
Frankly, at $300 a session, your problems are music to my ears.
So Eric, you shot the sheriff . What was it that caused you not to shoot the deputy?
Now, Jed, do you honestly believe that there's nothing sexual about, "She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes, when she comes"?
I can't fix your pickup unless your pickup wants to be fixed.
As your therapist, I'm glad you have found a hobby that allows you to express yourself. As a music lover, I'd like you to stop.
It sounds like clinical depression, but I'll need you to sing through the bridge again to be sure.
We"ll get nowhere if you keep tuning me out.
And when you learned that 'Don't Fence Me In' was written by Cole Porter, how did that make you feel?
Stop! Tell me more about this man you shot in Reno.
How did you feel when the deer and antelope played without you?
Thanks for the song.  I think I know why you’re lonesome.
As I said last week, no boots on the couch.
Our time is up, but I'll allow a short encore.
Where would you like to start today? Whiskey, women, or little dogies?
There are cheaper ways to find an audience, Jim.
Discouraging words and cloudy skies are part of life.
When did you first notice that the trails actually weren't happy?
Sounds like a discouraging word to me.
You know I can’t share what your horse told me. We have privacy laws.
You really need to add lyrics if we're going to make any progress.
We’ve been over this. You can’t keep pulling the same string and expecting a different note.
So, on a scale from C minor to F sharp, how would you rate your blues today?
But why did the horse have no name?
Clinically, it's referred to as a "foggy mountain breakdown".
We'll circle back to the dog. But for now let's focus on the truck.
Except me—I know the troubles you’ve seen.
Tell me what your woman gone done to you.
What do YOU think the deer and the antelope were doing?
It’s perfectly normal to not like country music.
Seldom hearing a discouraging word is not always a healthy thing.
And why does the possibility that 'she'll be riding six white horses when she comes' cause you anxiety?
I think it’s clear. Your woman just done you wrong.
You seem a little high-strung.
If you truly want closure on Clementine's death, I suggest you add a verse about how you're now sleeping with her sister.
How long has it been since you felt at home on the range?
It's not your fault you were born and raised in Connecticut.
Mom was right. We sure are different for identical twins.
Now I'm depressed.
Oh, let me guess: she done you wrong?
I'm referring you to one of my pardners.
Have you had any stable relationships?
I'm concerned that you never really allowed yourself to git along.
The truth is you're really not at home on the range.
If you play it one more time, you'll hear a discouraging word.
I believe when we left off you were out in the west Texas town of El Paso."
If you're that lonesome, go ahead and cry.
So do you want me to cure your blues or bring them back?
I don't know what rhymes with schizophrenia.
And yet you've said you never heard a discouraging word!
Sure, we'll call it the Wild Upper West if you'd prefer.
About this discouraging word, just how seldom was it heard?
So when a discouraging word IS heard, how does that make you feel?
It is NOT YOU, sometimes deer and antelope fight, and sometimes it's even cloudy during the day
We'll pick up next week with the hankerin'.
And does that make you feel good, bad, or ugly?
Something tells me you don't know when to fold 'em.
Is it possible that Clementine expressed her ambivalence toward you by continuing to live with her father?
So, you finally heard a discouraging word.
You do know that this isn't the West. It's just the Upper West Side.
I’d like to hear more about those discouraging words you think you heard.
Really? You seldom heard a 'discouraging' word?
Ok, you are out on the streets of Laredo, you've spied a young cowboy, go on.
My wife got the horse.
So you never really felt at home on the range?
Willie Nelson or Patsy Cline Crazy?
Are you still hearing discouraging words?
Now I know why you're a lonesome cowboy.
Tell me more about your frets
Can you accept yourself as a non-rhinestone cowboy?
I understand your passion for your guitar, but you do realize there are strings attached?
First, the key must want to change.
As it turns out, you're okay. It's your guitar that's out of tune.
You seldom have heard a discouraging word? Why are you even here?
Can you embrace that you're also a little bit rock and roll?
Of  course, sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
Would you say these discouraging words came more from your mother or father?
Would you feel more confortable opening up if we had a campfire?
I think you should enroll in a good two step program.
It's not your fault your mother let you grow up to be a cowboy.
So let me see if I have this correct. You live in New York City, you don't own a pickup truck, your wife hasn't left you, and you really don't like county music.
We generally call it a relapse, Roy, but Back in the Saddle Again works, too.
Let's see if I understand: The skies are cloudy all day, and you frequently hear discouraging words?
Well on that note, our time’s up
... and just how often have you been hearing these discouraging words?
You know, sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
Do you think that your expectation to never hear a discouraging word might have been unrealistic?
I wouldn't worry about it, Tex. Sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
We'll get you back in the saddle."
So we've established you're lonesome.
Have you tried whiskey and women instead?
I'm sorry about your dog, your mother, and your lover, but boots off the couch.
No, nothing rhymes with existential dread
Ok from the top, but make it less full of self-loathing
Perhaps you need a relationship with no strings attached.
And the Dale Evans dreams... have they stopped?
Now, tell me, when did you hear a discouraging word?
Tell me about Susanna.
How seldom do you hear this discouraging word?
You keep making this about the cattle. I'm interested in what drives you.
That may be true on the range, but in this room we do hear a discouraging word.
You're fretting too much.
Yeah, so that’s not what I meant when I said I take ‘cash’ for payment.
You say you seldom have heard an encouraging word?
So, you heard a discouraging word...then what happened?
And when these buffalo roam... is your father with them?
Let’s end on a positive note.
Time to mosey on home partner
And how do you feel when you hear a discouraging word?
I understand, but discouraging words are actually encouraged here.
Could you say more about this ‘burning ring of fire’ ?
OK, your dog died, the truck won't start and your woman left you. We covered that last time. What else is bothering you?
I think you need to change your tune.
So your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll.
Yes, we’ve discussed her cheatin’ heart before.
Would you prefer she call you a cow-man?
So what do you think prompted Lucille to leave when she did?
And how long have you been out of tune.
So you’re saying she done left you.
Why Do you suppose your mother did not want you to grow up to be a cowboy?
And these little doggies, did they finally get along?
Tell me more about why you are no longer allowed at campfires...
So when you realized the deer and the antelope DIDN'T play, how did that make you feel?
You say your wife ran off with your best friend?  And you really miss him?
You clearly don't have the blues.
It's still a discouraging word, even if you sing it.
Your guitar is also strung too tight.
So, if I hear you right, you are feeling fenced in?
How long have you been fretting?
Please, go on about Clementine...
To paraphrase Freud: sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
Actually, I've heard discouraging words on a continuous basis.
How did that make you feel when the deer and antelope refused to play?
So it was FREQUENTLY that you heard discouraging words?
You're feeling stereotyped? Tell me about it.
So why do you feel so lonesome you could cry?
That's not exactly how your horse saw it.
Do you know “Don’t worry, be happy “?
Considering you're a rabbi from New York, the whole package is actually pretty impressive.
Let's pick it up from where your wife had driven off with your best friend in your new pickup.
But in your case, mama did let her baby grow up to be a cowboy, didn't she?
"If you have 'spurs that jingle-jangle-jingle' you've probably ruined my couch."
I think you are in denial Bill, sometimes the sky’s ARE cloudy all day
He was a dog; he died; get over it!
So, what you're saying is you're so lonesome you could cry."
You really changed your tune this session.
In clinical terms, we call that a hurtin’ song.
We're short on time, why don't you go right to the part where she took the kids and made off with your car.
Well, I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.
We’ll get you feeling better in no time. This isn’t my first rodeo.
You know that God, patriotism, beer, heartbreak, trucks, open plains, divorce, loner status, a good dog, a ball-breaking trading deficit with China, and the looming disaster global warming need not be all in one song.
If you're tired of living in isolation you'll have to risk hearing some discouraging words.
Can we go back to that second verse - the one where you kill your wife? We may be onto something there.
So, she never did come 'round the mountain?
You seem a bit tightly-strung.
I just heard a discouraging word.
Let me guess. You're lonesome?
Tell me more about your truck, your dog, and your no-good low-down cheatin' wife
I'm dreadful sorry about your Clementine.
So how long after you started to play did your horse leave you?
I know they were seldom, but how did these discouraging words make you feel?
So, why do you think the doggies stopped getting along?
I beg to differ. You'd be surprised how many people with faithful spouses, healthy dogs, low blood alcohol and no prison record go on to live perfectly productive lives.
Have you tried just talking to her?
I’ll have to charge you by the ballad.
Are you hearing discouraging words?
Thank you for leaving your horse in the waiting room this time.
Okay, your hour is up. Next week we'll work on the chorus.
Maybe a discouraging word is seldom heard because you don't want to hear it.
And when you heard a discouraging word, did the Wellbutrin help?
When did you and your dogies stop gitting along?
I don't care that the song is dedicated to me, you still owe me $350.
Perhaps you are a bit high strung.
Let's talk about all the girls you've loved before.
Thinking back, is ‘just to watch him die’ the only reason?
Couples' counseling might be the ticket, Tex. Next time, bring the horse.
The anwer my friend is blowing in the wind. . .our time is up.
I think shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die may stem from your dad naming you Sue.
And how do the discouraging words you’ve been hearing make you feel?
Let’s talk about why you changed to a minor key as soon as I mentioned your mother.
Have you considered that maybe you aren't good, bad or ugly?
Oh well, don't fret.
It seems you have some unresolved issues with Clementine.
So how did you feel when you heard a discouraging word?
How did it make you feel to hear those discouraging words?
Your mother is not the problem. It’s the horse.
a LOT of people are so lonesome they could cry...
And how do you feel about discouraging words?
And when the little doggies do git  along, how does that make you feel?
What kind of "discouraging words"?
Wait, go back to that verse about your mother.
And how did being a boy named Sue make you feel?
How can I help you if it's the same three chords every week?
I don't normally see cowboys, but I understand you pulled a few strings to get this appointment.
My pickup broke down and my dog died too. Quit whining.
Was it a broken home on the range?
I know what the song says but ‘the skies are not cloudy all day’ is an unrealistic expectation.
It’s our third session, Lefty. Let’s see if we can get past “howdy.”
It's likely that you are not used to hearing discouraging words. Your partner's suggesting you to take a bath more often could be considered helpful advice.
Well, why do YOU think you heard a discouraging word?
We'll have you back in the saddle again in no time.
If you are struggling with the words, I can write you a prescription for Lyrica.
Tell me more about your achy breaky heart
I suppose now is an awkward time to tell you, but I'm the person that ran off with your wife in verse three."
Nobody's that lonesome.
I see, and how long have you felt so lonesome you could die?
So, no more fretting and I'll see you next week
So, I take it the "drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds" dreams have returned.
So you’re still pickin’, but no longer grinnin’, correct?
No wonder, that song would drive anyone nuts
Perhaps you underestimate how often you hear discouraging words.
Then again, sometimes the tumbling tumbleweed is just a tumbling tumbleweed.
So why doesn't the horse have a name?
How long have you been feeling lonesome, cowboy?
Dog dead, check. Wife gone, check. Overbearing mother?
Get along little doggie, your hour is up.
Sure. Cry me a river.
Let's giddy-up your monthly dosage.
So, when you promised her a "home on the range" she didn't realize it involved cooking.
First, let’s mosey on back to your childhood.
"You'll be singin' a different tune if you don't get your boots off my couch, pardner.
You can’t blame yourself if the dogies simply won’t get along.
How does it make you feel when the skies are cloudy all day?
Let's go back to when the skies were not cloudy all day.

When, exactly, did you suspect her cheatin' heart?"
Strum a few bars - perhaps I'll recognize the syndrome.
I never doubted you were a man of constant sorrow.
I don't think it's the beard or the hat or the left-handed guitar or your mother.  You just have no talent.
I'm sure it would facilitate your sessions too, but a camp fire here is out of the question.
Frankly, I don't think you deserve your success either.
The deer and antelope didn't let you play?
But can you see how your need to sit around a camp fire can be interpreted as arson by others in your apartment block?
And when did all these discouraging words begin?
Yes, but how much longer will you blame your mama for letting you grow up to be a cowboy?

So, how is your achy breaky heart doing this week?
The range is supposed to be lonesome.
You're going to have to deal with the fact that, despite all advice to the contrary, your mother let you grow up to be a cowboy.
So, for how long have you been feeling so lonesome you could cry?
Let's discuss why you named the truck and the dog after your mother.
I hate to tell you a discouraging word, but...
Take responsibility, Tex. Don’t blame momma for letting you grow up to be a cowboy.
You must try not to fret.
No, really. I'd like to hear a discouraging word.
Looks like one or two more sessions, and we may have a number one country hit on our hands.

What is your cheating heart telling you?
So if I’m hearing you correctly, you shot a man in Reno just to watch him die...
I see our time's up, so let's save your little dogies' adamant refusal to get along until next week.

Well, like we've said before, Tex, sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
It started with a boy, named Sue!

you rode into your id."  Is that about right?
Let’s move on from the truck and get back to the dog.

Can you play 'Feelings'?

It's a perfectly natural thing to fear, but we all have to eventually come to the end of the trail.
Next week,we'll pick it up from the bridge.
Yes, buffalo, deer and antelope...but how do YOU feel when the sky IS cloudy all day?

Why so certain that the misfortune of the little dogies is none of your own?
About how long has it been since you felt at home on the range?
These chronic lonesome feelings are quite common for people in your profession.
I’m so lonesome I could cry too...but I’m not singing about i
On the outside people see cowboy but on the inside I have always felt like an indian.
It is perfectly normal. In college many boys experiment with reggae riffs.
And then all I heard were discouraging words
These feelings are not uncommon, but there are plenty of women who would be satisfied with just an 8-gallon hat.
So, after your wife ran off with your no-account brother, how long was it till the dump truck ran over your dog?
Let’s see. Your dog died, your wife left you and your pickup was stolen. That about it?
What happened to the tuxedo and cello?
Let's see, your Daddy left you at age 3 and named you Sue. So what brings you here?
So you wandered the desert on a horse with no name and still can't come up with a name.
So, this man in Reno that you shot?  Tell me more about him.
...so give me a home where the ‘bison’ roam?  I think I see the problem.
Let’s discuss how your day went and a 1 and a 2...
Okay, so tell me more about this hitch in your giddy-up?
Shall I assume that "Git along Little Doggie"  is cowboy code for " I don't want to talk about my mother?"
You may have lost your dog, your horse and your woman, but you still have to pay me.
And do you think the little doggies resented your telling them to git along?
So you keep hearing a discouraging word and the skies are cloudy all day.
Have you tried playing right-handed?
And how long would you say you've had these lovesick, lonesome blues?
When did you realize the "cold,cold heart" might be yours?
Are you sure there weren't more complex motivations than "Just to watch him die"?
Let’s focus on the 10-gallon half-full.
Looks like our time is up for today. Now, git along, li'l doggie.
If that's the way you want it, I'll start singing the questions."
So your mama didn't want you to grow up and be a cowboy. How does that make you feel?
I'm a bit concerned that you're still feeling so lonesome you could cry.
Do you believe your father intended his words to be discouraging?
Let's revisit that second verse.
Recognizing you've got the blues is the first step toward overcoming them.
Just three chords and the truth, please.
When you speak of your truck, do you mean your mother?
But WHY do you think you're a lonesome cowboy?
Without lyrics, my diagnosis may be a bit speculative.
Let's start where we left off last week. You were at home on the range and you heard a discouraging word. How did the make you feel about yourself?
I sense a resentment towards your Mother, for letting you grow up to be a cowboy.
Sometimes a hat is just a hat.
You've got pluck.
I'll make note of that.
Our sessions would be more effective if you used your words.
One yodel, and we're through.
Yes, but what do you suppose the root of this achy-ness and/or breaky-ness is?
If I hear you, you're so lonesome you could cry
My wife's still with me, my dogs alive and I haven't crashed my truck in years.
So, in your dream, as you walked out in the streets of Laredo, you spied a young cowpoke.  Tell me, did he look like your mother?
Let me see if I got the refrain right...
“It can happen to you, if you’re Jung at heart”.
I'm referring you to a musicologist.
Tell me more about the streets of Laredo.
So tell me when you first noticed your girlfriend left you, took your dog, and stole your truck.
So, when you are lonesome, and could cry, how else do you feel?
My advice to you is: Hit the road Jack and don't you come back!
Okay, but now go back a few bars.
It's seldom I hear a discouraging word in your lyrics. What's wrong?
And how long have you been seeing these ghost riders in the sky?
Your heart is broken, you drink whiskey, and you drive a pickup truck - is there anything else I should know?
You seem a little flat. I'm writing you a quarter rest and crescendo until next time.
You say you grew up when seldom was heard a discouraging word.
So, your wife left you, the bank repossessed your truck, and then your dog died. How did that make you feel?"
Singing the same sad song isn't progress.
I'm sorry sir, but the "honky tonk blues" are not in the DSM.
Go back to when you were a young cowhand, before you got to the Rio Grande.
It seems we've both struck a chord.
And WHY were you drunk the day your mom got out of prison?
Let's just go with that - sometimes a guitar is just a guitar.
OK. Tell me about your dogie.
And the fact that the guitar is shaped like your mother...?
Let’s talk about your achy-breaky heart
Our time is up little dogie.
And how does that transition from major to minor really make you feel?
Look, it's your hour, but if I were you, I'd skip the chorus and just share your feelings with me about this Clementine of yours.
So, you say that "the range" is the only place where you feel at home.
Why do you think the deer and the antelope play?
If you want me to help you heal, you’ll have to stop picking at that.
A lonesome whistle blowin'...  And what was your second memory?
Let me get this straight, your wife left you, your dog ran away, and your truck was repossessed?  You're ready to be a country star.
Why are you obsessed with the deer and antelope playing?
Not just bipolar, more like yippee high, yippee low.
So you say they're building a wall "where the buffalo roam?"
So, when did you start feeling this compulsion to play jazz?
Let's see. . . your dog, pick-up truck and mother. Let's focus on your mother.
Do you feel that all trails are lonesome?
Cry me a river.
And how did losing your momma, your dog and your pickup truck make you feel?
Maybe if you hadn't gotten a fucking worthless music degree you would be able to support your wife and kids and she wouldn't have left you. Did you ever think about that?
And you say your girlfriend prefers the strings unattached?
So when did you discover you were a Jewish cowboy?
When, exactly, did you stop feeling at home, home on the range?
Beautiful lyrics, but now I'm depressed.
...and that is string theory.
What makes you say that your Mamma shouldn't have let you grow up to be a cowboy?
Would it help if the home had cats instead of buffalo?
We had been talking about your dog, your truck, and your wife.
What led your wife to accuse you of having a mid-life crisis?
Of course you're neurotic. You play country and western.
Yes, if it helps, sing it.
So do you know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em?
How did it make you feel when those dogies wouldn't git along?
Do you think you may be trying to tell yourself something with your rendition, "Home, Home On Derange"?
So, do you think you should hold ‘em or fold ‘em?
Take a sad song and make it better.
So, your Mama wanted a doctor, or lawyer, or such?
Pardon me. You said your girlfriend has not cheated on you and you don't drink to excess?
So you feel anger that mama done let her baby grow up to be a cowboy.
You know if you didn't have to rhyme I might find out more.
So encouraging words are seldom heard?
I’ll thank you not to spit tobacco juice on my Persian rug every time I mention your mother.
Where do you feel most at home?
If we can’t move past your old sad song, I’m afraid this will be our last session.
So your mamma didn’t want you to grow up and become a cowboy?
So you blame your mother for letting you grow up to be a cowboy.
I’d prefer your co-pay in cash, not Cash.
Slim, not every sad story fits into a country song.
Alright. Let's take you off all Country. I am prescribing 3 hours of Dixieland Jazz daily. We may add some Bubblegum Pop if that doesn't help.
Full disclosure—I’d have grown up to be a cowboy if my mama had let me.
And how did loosing your girl, your truck, and your dog make you feel?
So you say the deer and the antelope aren't playing anymore?
You say you can't remember the Alamo?
... and when was it that you first started to feel lonesome?
You know, it's never too late to give up and work in finance.
So, in the dream, you are playing guitar. What instruments do the deer and antelope play?
I think you need to join a two-step group.
So your woman left you, you lost your job, your dog died and you got drunk last night. How does that make you feel?
Well, I have come to the conclusion that mommas really should not let their babies grow up to be cowboys.
'It's not quite what I had in mind when I said you should spend some time in the country.'
Why the blues, if the skies are not cloudy all day?
Perhaps the deer and the antelope are the one's with the issues.
You say you've been through the desert on a horse with no name, yet you now refer to it as "Mother." What do you think that means?
So this just started out of the blues?
And after the cattle drive...
you felt empty.
And how is your relationship with your... er...horse?
Well, if you say: 'seldom is heard a discouraging word and the sky is not cloudy all day,' what's the problem?
You can’t be “Back in the Saddle Again” until you conquer your fear of horses.
Let's try to break from the 'what in tarnation' and concentrate on the 'who in tarnation'.
It’s a new type of therapy where you play the guitar for 50 minutes and I charge you $200.
You've got to stop blaming your mamma for letting you grow up to be a cowboy.
In my professional opinion, I don’t believe minor chords are a healthy coping mechanism.
When I ask how something feels, I'd like you to use words.
Beto, get a shave and run for President, it'll take your mind off yourself.
Why do YOU think your mama didn't let you become a doctor, or lawyer, and such?
I think it's fairly obvious why mom liked me best.
Now tell me exactly how it struck a chord with you.
Now, sing that one about your mother again.
Wait, I'm still on the first verse...
Yes, I understand you're a lone cowhand from the Rio Grande.  Unfortunately, you also have 'mommy' issues.
What brings you in today if indeed, seldom is heard a discouraging word?
I am following you, just not in that key.
I know you're so lonesome you could cry, but you have to remember you have friends, even if they are in low places.
Did you say you went to Yale or to Jail?
Tell me more about your relationship with the little dogie.
Sure, mosey can be a doorway to the subconscious.
Perhaps if you describe feeling “de-ranged”...
Your mother was right. You can't play worth a damn.
You say your horse left you?
Where ‘seldom’ is heard a discouraging word”? That’s rich, coming from you
Seldom is heard a discouraging word? Gimme a break.
Everyday is cloudy in here and I'm sick of it.
I'd like you to answer that same question again, this time in D Major.
Well, for openers, Hendrix and McCartney WERE left-handed.
So, it's so lonely in the saddle since your horse died?
What were your feelings towards Susanna when you had a banjo on your knee?
Tell me more about your pick-up truck, your ole dog, and the gal that left you.
When did you first realise your heart felt so achey breaky?
Even live, you sound like a broken record
Do you think your feelings were brought about by the discouraging words or from the skies being cloudy all day?
It's New York City, Hank- I think you have delusions of pasture.
I think we've both heard this tune before.
So, let me get this straight. You say ya woman done left ya and done took off  with ya truck, dog, best friend and done left ya with this 'ere geetar.
We’ll have to pick up next week on why your baby ain’t comin’ back.
So discouraging words were more than seldom heard. Continue.
Have you tried drinking the pain away?
How would you feel about making more effective use of your 45 minutes by skipping the refrain?
Sorry, cash only - I can't host these sessions for a song.
So....your wife left you, your dog died, and then your truck broke down. But has anything unusual happened lately?
I think we can get at least three more albums out of this session
So in this dream, you just can’t keep them dogies rollin, no matter what?
Have you considered that it is you who must git along, not the doggies?
I prescribed pickin' and grinnin', Mr. Farber. Clinically speaking, what you're doing is strummin' and bummin'.
Why don’t you start with “Nobody Knows the Troubles I’ve Seen.”
And  how do you feel when the little doggies don't get along?
I think you are doing remarkably well considering you lost your dog, your truck broke down and your girlfriend left you.
When you say your mule is stubborn, have you considered his point of view?
How did you feel when she told you not to grow up and be a cowboy?
And sometimes a guitar is not just a guitar.
So you came from Alabama with guitar on your knee...
I’ve noticed your use of minor chords when singing about your mother.
I would like to revisit that last bar during our next session
And you say you've never been west of Park Avenue?
I agree the curves are great, but face it, Hal, it's a GUITAR!
So your mama died, your girl left you, and you ended up on a train. Anything else bothering you?
Excellent progress! Seldom is better than frequent.
I'm sorry to inform you, but 'them cowtrail blues' isn't listed in the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.'
I see... and to you does the word “Range” signify land or a cooktop?
lets start over. and a one two three four
We need to set some boundaries. I’m your doctor, not your partner.
Don't blame your mother for letting you grow up to be a cowboy
So let's start with your home on the range.
Country lyrics describe your troubles, but they don't solve them.
And how long have you been hearing the lonesome sound of the whipporwill?
Yes, but sometimes a ten-gallon hat is just a ten-gallon hat.
And do you think your "no strings attached" approach is working?
I think we can get to the bottom of most of that but—if we do—what will you have left to sing about?
I'm happy to discuss your darling Clementine,
but we really should finish with your Mother first.
Going mad, going country... the DSM 
doesn't really make a distinction.
How do the words "no talent" make you feel?
Tell me about your achy-breaky heart
I need to hear a few more verses before I’ll know if it’s Lonesome Cowboy Lovesick Blues or clinical depression
A little Cole Porter might be the answer.
Sometimes a guitar is just a guitar....
Why do you resent your mother for letting you grow up to be a cowboy?
If you sing "Darling Clementine" again, I'll have you committed.
This week I'd like to circle back to your repressed memories of Dinah in the kitchen.
We’ll come back to the deer and the antelope, but first tell me more about the sort of ‘discouraging word’ you’re not hearing.
So, other than your momma, whiskey, trains, and prison, tell me something about yourself.
Im flattered that you have written a song about me, but I am still going to charge you for this session and I would appreciate you taking your boots off my couch.
I’d say if you keep breaking her G-string,  it’s time to consider HER feelings.
So tell me, what was it like growing up in a home on the range?
So, going down the road feelin' bad.  Then what?
You can sing to your heart´s desire, but you are still paying for the session.
I’d like to explore your social relationships. Let’s begin with your friends in low places.
When it gets down to it, the question you need to ask yourself is, “Zeke, does being home on the range still spark joy?”
Play Misty for me.
So how does it make you feel that Mamma did let her baby grow up to be a cowboy, not a doctor or lawyer or such?
...and so she let you grow up to be one?
...and how long have you had this fear of rodeo clowns?
I really wish you would remove your spurs before hitting the couch
Is it just the name of the song or did your mother actually not want you to grow up to be a cowboy?
Try singing 'Thank God I'm a Country Boy' instead of 'Oh lonesome Me.'
So, I’ve got you lost your job, your wife left you and then your dog died? Anything else you’d like to share?
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, you say? I think we're making progress...
So, you say you've been having performance issues?"
So far we’ve covered break-ups, trucks and the flag.
So the deer and the antelope actually played together?
It represents a penis.
Do you have any lyrics that rhyme with "Oedipal"
And how did this lonesome tumbleweed feel inside?
Strum the verse about your toilet training again.
Now try playing a song without the word lonesome in it
Sorry to interrupt, but your spurs are ripping through the leather of my chaise lounge
When she dumps you, the music will come.
Why do you think you want the little dogies to git along?
Let's hear the refrain about your mother again.
Dan, let's try and understand them, not just rope, throw, and brand them.
Hold on, Amos. So the coyote and can of beans aren’t metaphors?
your dog died, your girlfriend left you, and what was that about your pickup truck?
Would you say, seldom is heard an encouraging word?
Well, perhaps open mic night isn’t the same kind of safe space.
So, the trail is long, women are "no good", and you're drunk. What else?
I’ve got nerves that jingle jangle jingle.
Try singing about alcohol, bad bosses or break-ups instead of how little musical talent you have.
Classic case of the blues.
'" Mr. Smith,about your issues,I said you had to fess up not dress up."
Sometimes, a guitar is just a guitar. How often are you strumming?
Every week, it's the same old song with you.
How did the discouraging word make you feel?
I assure you there are some very fine musicians who never played Carnegie Hall.
I can’t lower your dosage until you stop writing ballads in E Minor.
And when did you first start believing that the skies are not cloudy or gray?
Where the buffaloes groan?  Maybe you should rethink that...
...you have to accept that you're just a lonesome cowpoke and move on.
Yes, you are definitely a little high strung.
But do you REALLY remember the Red River Valley?
You may be from the OK chorale, but — you’re actually just so-so.
Actually, that sounds more like the blues
Okay, from the top: 'My childhood was hell, my dog ate the cat, my house wouldn't sell, and I'm gettin' fat.'
How long have you felt like a rapper trapped inside a country singer's body?
You know what that tune means... Our time is up.
The deer and antelope are benign fantasy but this obsession about 'discouraging words' seems passive aggressive towards our work.
Before we begin, can you play "Girl from Ipanema?"
So you you’re saying is that your momma didn’t want you to grow up to be a cowboy?
Yes, I HAVE heard that one before!
So what your saying is that although it was indeed the west Texas town of El Paso but you actually fell in love with a mexican boy?
Perhaps a cardiologist could help you with your "achy breaky heart."
And so tell me more about these buffaloes roaming in your home
Git along lil' dogie.  We're almost out of time.
You simply have to accept that people are not going to give you a home on a range.
How long have you had these Desperado feelings?
I don't appreciate people with dirt on their boots [submitted by Noah, age 8]
It sounds like you're feeling lonesome...
Before we go further into the sordid details of your life, tell me, where did you get those beautiful boots?
Your strumming your pain with your fingers,Tex,and it's killing you softly.
Tell me more about your truck.
What I'm hearing is that your dogies won't git.
Let’s put aside your girl, truck, and dog...
You want a second opinion huh, well you're ugly too.
We could cover more of your issues if you skip the second chorus.
Willie, sure you're lonely, blue, cryin', and in love, but you aren't crazy.
Call me judgemental, call me old-fashioned, but I still believe that a gentleman, when indoors, removes his hat.
Just as I suspected: country-line personality disorder.
I’ll tell you why the cowboy wanted a dachshund.  He wanted to get a long little doggie.
How you feel about your mama letting you grow up to be a cowboy?
More like “Home on the Deranged” in my opinion.
It is not the guitar's fault you sound terrible.
But in our previous session you told me that you wanted a life with no strings attached.
I sense you're in a rut. Every week I hear the same old song.
Your song has the cheatin' wife,heartbreak,beer,boots,honkytonk,truck,and tractor. But nothing about a dog. Tell me about the dog.
So, your wife left and your dog died, but what happened to your horse?
It’s alright, I often have people coming in here singing the blues.
Working "for a song" is just an expression.
Speaking of desire, tell me more about your hat.
Most patients just tell me their problems.
So tell me, how did you get the name 'Billy the Id' ?
I'm afraid I can't help, nothing rhymes with orange.
Okay, but this time, let me sing the harmony.
Why are you so fixated on the G-string
Tell you what: you play Willie Nelson and I'll play Doctor.
I'm afraid we're out of time. It was 4/4, correct?
And why do you think your little dogies won’t git along?
Have you ever thought that you actually want to be lonesome?
And what are your feelings toward this "little doggie" person you keep referring to?
Let's begin with the premise that you don't have to suffer to sing the blues.
And so we shall try to discover why,indeed,your guitar gently weeps.
If we are to get anywhere you have to stop singing the same old tune.
Do you want me to take the country out of the boy, or the boy out of the country?
Ok, your mama got out of prison, you went to pick her up in the rain, before you got to the station in your pick up truck, she was run over by a train.  Uh huh. Sounds familiar.  Keep going...
I'm hearing: B,A,G,G,A,G,E#
Try to remember. You must have sometimes heard a discouraging word from your mother.
In my professional opinion, no, you are not crazy for feeling so lonely.
Try it again with a little less feeling
I understand how you feel about picking on her, but you shouldn’t fret about it.
Perhaps you could express yourself more fully with castanets.
So, why do you want to play me a song you wrote about a cowboy who kills his psychiatrist?
You sound a little flat.
It sounds like you’re just picking on yourself.
So? What makes you think you're high strung?
It's a form of PTSD. We used to call it Saddle Fatigue.
So you’re telling me that sometimes a guitar is just a guitar...
How long has it been since you lost your home on the range?
Sounds like you’re angry your mama let her baby grow up to be a cowboy.
I don't think your relationship with your horse is the problem.
If you try reversing your behavior, you may get your truck, your dog, and  your wife back."
We'll explore the deer and antelope in time. I'm afraid our attention is more urgently required by the buffalo.
I can be your psychiatrist or I can be your muse, but I can't be both.
So, I'm taking it this ain't your 1st rodeo?
Tell me more about the verse where your horse married your girlfriend.
I don't see many left-handed guitar players in here.
So you're telling me that you've lost your edge because of your faithful wife, your well-adjusted children, your intolerance for booze, and your luxury condo over the Hollywood Hills ?
So there you are on the range. What happens next?
Tell me again what kind of blues you got.
You may hear a few discouraging words, but it's still fairly seldom.
So, your home is...not on the range?
So, you had 100 bottles of beer on the wall. Now, you have 3. How does that make you feel?"
At least tune the damn thing
Tell me how that made  you feel. In the key of G.
You say it began with a Mexican girl in El Paso?
Lucille lives with me now, Slim. Coming here and singing that song every week just isn’t productive.
Well, Tex, I would surmise that you're missing a few strings.
I hope the noises in your head sound better then what I'm hearing
So, now when you're back home on the range you hear a discouraging word?
In the wake of what’s happened with your dog, and now your wife - it’s clear you’re dealing with some serious abandonment issues.
And how did it make you feel when you first heard that discouraging word?
It’s a great song, but it won’t bring back your horse.
You say “Seldom was heard ...” Exactly how often?
Please describe the events on the day you became so happy you could no longer write a country song.
When did you first experience these lonesome feelings?
Now sing to me again why your Momma didn’t want her son to grow up to be a cowboy.
And why do you think you're so lonesome?
If you’re free of depression you’ll never sing country again...
Pardner, it's time to move from 'music therapy' to 'talk therapy."
Let’s begin with that one you wrote about your mother.
That's pretty dark. Have you tried it in a major key?
I really see no need to fret so much.
I think your issues stem from this Mexican maiden in the West Texas town of El Paso.
Your fretting strikes a major chord with me.
I'd say you really opened up well about momma, trains, drinking, brothels, work, the gov't, and the women that did ya wrong for a first session. Let's do this again next week
You seem conflicted between Country and the Blues
So not having a home where the buffalo roam ... how does that make you feel?
So, to recap: jail, your mother, a dog, a pickup truck, rain, and dammed ol' train. Did I get that right?
And why don't you feel home on the range?
Can you play that verse about your mother again?
No! I don’t want to hear “Guantanamera” again.
So you resent your Mama for letting you grow up to be a cowboy...
How do we help you become a CowMAN?
Just sing what comes into your mind.
So, darlin' Clementine was lost. How does that make you feel?
Is that when the bullying over your falsetto began?
So tell me, why don't 'you' feel at home on the range?
OK, your woman done left you and your dog done died. But how does that make you feel?
How long have you been feeling lonesome and blue?
I'll forego a decade's worth of psychological exploration and analysis, and cut to the point. That's a left-handed guitar.
I can't help people compose the blues;
I help people get over the blues.
Are you trying to tell me you can't pay my bill because the antidepressants are making you too happy to write country songs?
Now that you've sung about your horse, sing about your relationship with your mother.
Western Psychiatry
Have you considered the possibility that your problem does NOT rhyme with "Old Cow Hand" or "Rio Grande"?
Just accept that you’re not on the range anymore, you will hear many a discouraging word here. it’s not personal
Well, how would you feel about adding a fourth chord?
How long have you identified as a violinist?
Hmm, so your baby done left you for someone better, din'  say goodbye or leave a letter.  How does that make you feel?
The cause of all your problems is that your mama let her babies grow up to be cowboys.
Tell me about your cowboyhood.
I'm guessing you want to walk this lonesome valley again this week.
You say her name is Lucille?
Have you ever considered finding a home where the buffalo don't roam?
Sorry Roy but you are on the gene autreyism spectrum
I can't give you the blues... it just wouldn't be ethical
Tell me more about "boy?" After all these years, why not "cowman?"
She’s not coming back, Roy.  Now, sing something about your mother.
It sounds like you've got a right to sing the blues.
Pick, pick, pick!  Sounds like that's all you do!
Tell me more about this dogie.
What makes you think others still see you as a kid, Bill?
How would you describe your relationship with your horse?
Why do you think the buffalo roam?
And when your ex-wife left with your truck and your dog, how did that make you feel?
I see. So you woke up this morning and shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
Tex, let's try to get beyond "What would Waylon and Willie do?"
I guess we’re both keeping time today
So your wife left you, your dog ran away, and your pickup trucked died?  How were things bedore that?
So, when you say “Get along little dogie,” do you mean “Please move out, Mother?
What I’m hearing you say is, ‘She done me wrong.’  I  think it’s time to discuss ‘enabling.’
Now the next verse...what happened after your wife cheated on you?
For most of my patients the 'id' comes out best in E flat.
So Sam, how was Yosemite?
Your G-string is a little tight.
In your case, you can blame your mother.
Are you lonesome, cowboy? Or is that just a metaphor?
In theses dreams where you're walking out in the streets of Laredo -- what exactly do you see?
OK, now play it like you did in the dream.
Let's further explore your relationship with that horse you keep singing about.
Why do you think your mama let you grow up to be a cowboy?
You're repeating yourself.
How does all your exes living in Texas make you feel?
You blame your mamma, ja? For letting her baby grow up to be cowboy?”
I'm not sure an 'achy breaky heart' appears anywhere in the American Psychiatric Journal.
We’re not discussing your mother.  Can YOU forgive you for growing up to be a cowboy?
I think it's possible that the town IS big enough for the two of you.
You’re even depressing me with those minor chords.
I thought that's where you seldom heard a discouraging word.
It sounds to me like the same old song.
Change ‘lonesome’ to ‘gregarious.’ How does that make you feel?
No, we don't validate for "horse parking."
When did you realize you were trying to play it left-handed?
Wait -- your dog cheated on you.  So why blame your woman?
Your horse was right, you should let him do the vocals.
Hold on. Your wife, your girl, and your baby are all the same person?
So you say your Mama Tried.
I get it. Your dog has fleas. Let's move on.

You are a little off key.
Maybe you should stop writing songs about your oedipus complex. People prefer songs about anxiety disorders.
Lonesome you sang?
I'll waive my usual fee if you agree to credit me as co-lyricist.
...and then my third album, "Havin' a Hoe-down with Dr. Schwartz" also went double platinum..."
So I would say your depression began when you got kicked out of ZZ Top
So, you feel perhaps your mother didn’t want you to grow up to be a cowboy?
So you say that you've never felt more alive as you feel when dressed up like an old West Singing Cowboy? Let's unpack that, Mr. Bergstrom.
It's not you. It's millennials.
Tell me again--when did the blue skies start smiling at you?
And when did your guitar start resisting to being tuned
And how do you think us being separated at birth had affected you?
Maybe it was actually you doing the leavin’.
I have a strong sense of the source of your frustration and suggest you title your next tune "City Girls Don't Love Me 'cause I smell Like A Horse".
You can't be country unless you understand your blues.
Sing another verse about that.
So, you’re not sure whether to ride off into the sunset, or get drunk at a saloon?
You have to be in tune, otherwise I can't help you.
After years of singing,'Git along little Dogies,' you're obviously suffering from acute separation anxiety.
Tell me more about the buffalo that roam..
You're depressing me!
So how long have you been feeling 'dischordant,' Mr. Jones?
How soon after leaving Wall Street did you start playing guitar?
By any chance, do you know Streets of Laredo?
But you have a home, a home on the range.
Tell me about the whippoorwill.
Maybe K-Pop just isn't your genre...
Laying down again;
Setting on his couch again;
Got Mamma on the brain, I’m just talkin with Sigmund Freud again,” is not the most productive analysis response, Mr. Nelson.
Tell me again why you don't want to be buried on the lone prairie.
Tell me that part again about 'Waylon, Willie, and the boys'
When did border issues first affect your songwriting?
I’ve heard this one before
My politically correct analysis, it's all about your tone.
And what happened after the bottle let you down?
Okay, once more, and dig deeper this time.
Yes, yes, continue singing..."where seldom is heard a discouraging word".  OK, now we're making progress!
So, sometimes you think you're a cow, and sometimes a boy.
Not to worry, you'll get over the Lovesick Blues. I'm more concerned about your amorous feelings for Old Paint.
Perhaps a bit more development of the theme of loneliness in the B section?
Your sound is troublesome, have you tried playing right handed?
How long has it been since your horse really enjoyed your singing?"
An achy breaky heart you say?
This is going to be a hit.  Now tell me the next line.
You keep singing and we have to switch seats.
So did your mother play the guitar?
Its not a phase Doc.
I think the real problem here is what you're wearing.
How are these deep notes of despair, regret, hopelessness, and anguish working for you?
I love your 5th bar transition to G Major.
Your wife does not appreciate ze buffaloes roaming in your home?
'Tell me more about these low places.'
More major, less minor.
Your dog died, wife left you,house burnt down,kids don’t talk to you,diagnosed with a terminal illness,anything else happen last week?
I think we both know who is really benefiting from our session today.
Okay, now tell me again--it was your mother, girlfriend wife or dog that got run over by a truck or left you??
Try it right-handed, cowboy.
Maybe give onomatopoeia a rest and move on to iambic pentameter.
Let me make this clear, when you dress you think you're ranch dressing...
Ridin' the range and lookin' strange -
you have accomplished your goal.
You know you might save a little money if you just did an open mic now and again.
You're stuck in A Minor key.
Tell me more about where the Buffalo roam.
So it was right around the time you said you were going to hog tie and brand her that her manner changed?
So...you’re an old cowhand, from the Rio Grand, and you’ve lost your way?
In this session we will cover the "String Theory" verses the "Chaos Theory".
I'd recommend Prozac or a 1 hour recording session with Dolly Parton for your depression.
Yes, if your horse doesn't like your singing, that's his problem. But if he stops every time you start, that's your problem, isn't it?
Mr. Autry, you've made tremendous progress, but you're still just a little pitchy.
The refrain needs some work.
Don’t fret. I’ll just take a few notes so you can get back in the saddle and on the road again.
'Waylon Jennings didn't literally mean you couldn't grow up to be a cowboy.'
So you're galloping toward  Rosa's Cantina in the west Texas town of El Paso, and cowboys are shooting at you. How did you feel about the Wall?
Cause Nationwide is on your side.
Now where exactly did you say your home was?
Have you always had this urge to get back on the road?
Have you considered playing something other than blues?
So, to summarize . . . you cannot let go of this fear of being buried on the lone prairie . . . yes
Talk to me about the discouraging words you did hear in your home, home.
So, tell me more about how you're lonesome now that your girlfriend left you for your best friend and your mother got caught up by the law after breaking your father out of prison in a pickup truck.
So how did you feel when your mom hopped a train to come get you out of jail?
Him: “How many roads can a man walk down before they call him a man?”
Doctor: “The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind”
Have you considered alternatives to sad, sad songs?
So when your girlfriend left you and your tractor broke and your dog ran away....how did that make you feel?
I like the tune, but we've got more work to do on the lyrics.
I agree, ‘Tumblin’ tumbleweeds’ is a great metaphor for your erratic work history.
When did your delusions about being a singing cowboy begin, Dr. Freud?
With all due respect, I believe I said "cigar," not "guitar!"
Being lonesome doesn't mean you have to cry.
You say your horse died?
You say your cheatin' heart will make you weep, you'll cry and cry and try to sleep... and how does that make you feel?
So you never got along with the little dogies. Was that truly their misfortune, or none of your own?
So how did your mother's obsession with Waylon Jennings make you feel?
Tell me more about how your little doggies are getting along.
Tell me again about your mother ... this time, no singing.
Slow down. That's "Zip-a-dee...what?
Well, yes, perhaps Willie and Waylon were right.
Let's pick up next week with "drive them old trucks" and
see where we get.
If she don’t understand you and you don’t die young, you’ll probably just ride away.
I'm afraid your time is up
Tell me something: are you happy in this modern world?
So what comes after “I’m an old cow hand?”
I've been cry'n me a river for as long as I can remember, Doc!
Perhaps you should consider being more sensitive to the little dogeys' misfortune...
They’re bison, not “buffalo.”
Tell me where you think your fear of spaghetti started.
Let's see here...Last week you were telling me about a girl in the town of El Paso. Are you still feeling obsessed by her?
I’m not sure we can blame your mother for that flat note.
Always the same tune, eh Slim?
Tell me more about your mama.
So tell me more about your move form New York to Texas.
Even though you sleep with her I can't bill this as family therapy.
If you don't tune that properly, this session is over!
Sometimes a duet is just a duet.
one of your issues might be singing the answers to all of my questions
No, I can't accept payment in rhinestone.
Maybe the emptiness you're feeling is the absence of cowbell.
I’m about to lose my home on the range.
I have a couple of shots of whiskey that'll help."
No, you’re guns can’t do the talking.
All together now
I can imagine it is hard having Clint Eastwood as your dad.
And  how often do you dream that you're a lounge pianist?
Yes, I'm asking you not to play 'Wagon Wheel.'
So far we've covered catgut, tobaccy, momma, and a regretful past...let's take it from the top.
You said it was raining when your Mama got hit by the train?
You do realize that you can't housetrain a buffalo?
Home, home on the range.  What else do you recall?
When was the first time you start seeing dingo's?
Of course your reviews are bad!  You're not left-handed, are you?
That's the wrong key for 'El Paso.'
How does the realization that your dog has fleas make you feel?
Let me guess, your wife left you, your dog and pickup died and you thought it was a good idea to write a song about it?
My job can be lonely and boring,too,but I'd lose my license for that.
Have you tried singing the song in reverse?  You will get your truck, dog, and girl back.
And what age were you when did your mother start singing 'Drop Kick Me Jesus'?
Happy trails to you, until we meet again. Happy trails to you, keep smilin' until then . . .
Can you play some Dylan before he went electric...
I heard Hendrix and Cobain were left-handed too.
It’s no wonder you failed. You’re out of tune.
A little equine therapy might be just what you need.
I agree....You're out of tune
Could you spell “fixun” for me?
Now tell me more about the banjo nightmares.
It all started when I was home, home on the range...
No, I've never been to Texas.
...and you say it's some Susanna who does cry for you, right
Find yourself a cheatin floozy and you can cut a record!
Do you know Stairway to Heaven?
Well I-I-I am a man of constant so-rrow...
It seem we’ve sat and talked like this before ...
At our next session I want to really dig into why the misfortune was none of your own
Did you ever think about writing a song that was not so depressing?
Ok, you’ve convinced me that you are a Lonesome Cowboy, but you definitely are not Elvis.
Well, the way I see it is you're trying to go for a conservative audience while playing left-handed. And, by the way, I'll have to charge you for the cow pies that your boots are leaving on the divan.
Have you considered switching genres from country to the blues?
Perhaps you should lose the boots. Cowboy poets in Wellies are a dime a dozen.
Can we say that Willie Nelson is not envious of you?  Period
So Mr. Levine, how’s that Kkezmer Cowboy thing working for you?
So....you're still upset that Lucille left you, Willie?
If you’re in a Blues mood, play ‘Get your boots off my couch’!
How about you stop hiding behind that guitar for just one minute, Mark — just one goddamn minute, that’s all I ask after three years of doing this dance with you — and talk to me like you understand that this is your life, and you only get one?
Would you mind gittin' your 'little dogies' off my couch?
I'm sensing a pattern here,Dwight.
So your wife left you and took your pickup truck and your mom got drunk and got run over by a train?  Sounds like the perfect country western song.
I wrote a song, its called "No one ever herds me.
When did you first start feeling this way about your instrument?
No, you’re not an old cow hand.you’re not fooling me.Shave your beard off and get a haircut.see you next week
Well, that's a new tune.
So..You're an old cowhand-from the Rio Grande. But you never saw a cow?   Hmmmmmmm....
OK, next week you can be the psychiatrist!
Playing the same old song isn't getting you past your past.
A "home on the range" does not mean your wife enjoys being the only cook.
And these streets of Laredo remind you of your mother?
Buffalo meaning the team or the animal?
Do you know "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow?"
Since you switched to playing left handed, have you considered learning Western & Country music?"
Maybe if you switched to a minor key ...
I understand how 'Cowboy Junkies' might offend you.
Don't let your babies grow up to be saddle fitters" is catchy but..
You're too sensitive, is the problem. Critics pounce. It's just what they do, is all.
Can you tell me you plan when you get back in the saddle,again?
So come DOWN from your fences.  LET somebody love you.  Just do it.  Do it!
All together now, this time with feeling.
For starters, see if you could find a song that does not mention your mama, whiskey, or breakups
Yes, I realize it is challenging to learn to play left-handed.
I said "Sturm und Drang," not "Strum und Drang"
There’s 5 minutes left in your session. Can you play Wonderwall?
You're saying "singing cowboy" isn't a term you'd choose for yourself?
Sorry, you want your Mama or your Gaga?
Of course I like Patsy Cline. But we don't use that word in this office.
Did you ever discuss your lonesome blues with your Mama?
Tell me what happened after she told you to get your feet off the couch
Any other issues not involving a ‘yeller dawg’?
Some trails are happy. Some trails are blue. It's the way you ride the trail that counts, Ran, but our 45-minute trails a'endin'. So happy trails to you.  Until we meet again... "
So you say that in your home the buffalo no longer roam and the dear and the antelope refuse to play, now why do you think that is?
And vat is your association to "leetle dogeys?"
You’re mixing genres. It’s not “Take me Bach to Ole Kentucky!
Didn't your mother teach you to keep your boots off the furniture?
Relax.  I thought you were the outstanding entertainment at the Trump Inaugural.
When was the first time you had feelings for God, trucks, guns and beer?
Let’s croon about your mother.
Nice tune.  But "lonesome" isn't in listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual
Tell me Joe, where did you come from? Where did you go?
Tell me more about this "range" you sing of, and your earliest memories of said "home."
So, “It takes a worried man to sing a worried song” however you are content in the company of cows. Hmm!
But how does the broken down pickup truck make you feel?
OK. So you're saying your guitar only plays the blues?"
Have you tried performing the rap music I suggested in our last session?
You don't need that prop to show me your high-strung.
And when was it that your mother let you switch from violin lessons?
Tell me more about Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay
Man, always the same old song! Yes, your mother chose another man over you. Now, get over it.
Patience, my good man, the chorus is coming to me.  I just need to find a word that rhymes with 'Sigmund'.
I think "crapped his chaps" as a refrain would be an indicator of some cognitive issues.
Let's explore more why you hate the B7 chord.
When you have these dreams of being in Times Square, are you truly naked or still wearing tidy whities?
So, git along little dogies, what do you really mean by that?
This is a little ditty about my relationship with my momma
Your lyrics are always about booze and a broken heart. Don't you ever think about your mother?
Yippi Yi Ky-yo is a faux feeling
Yippie ka yay! I see your feeling better.
I see you play left-handed.  Are you always a contrarian?
It seems like your mother was a progressive.
Your Mother told you, "Son, always be a good boy,
don't ever play with guns,"
But you shot a man in Reno.  And you motivation was?
So what did your father say when you told him you preferred the high and lonesome life?
Well this room, this room right here, really is big enough for the two of us.
It's textbook border-line personality disorder
You lament about your "achy breaky heart".  I think we'll need to unpack that one.
Did you say Si or C?
And how old were you when you saw your first Coen brothers movie?
And how did it make you feel that your mother named you Buster?
Yes, you've got new verses this week, but you keep coming back to the same old chorus.
Never, a discouraging word, sometimes a little criticism not so bad.
You played it for your mother now play it for me. Play it!
Jed, how about singing me one about your mother.
You're playing the right chords and you're singing the right words, but there's absolutely no harmony in your id, ego, and super-ego.
Mr. McFry, why do you think Polly Wolly Doodle reminds you of me?
I realize it's a sacrifice, Raoul, but unless you give up the guitar, you'll always be the sidekick.
I so regret not learning to play guitar."
"And how did that make you feel, Doc?"
I understand this anxiety, but no one questions your folksy sagacity, so I see no reason to insist on the term "cow-man."
If you're really that down and out, I'm afraid this will have to be our last session.
Are your spurs that go jingle jangle jingle in the closet?
Sing your heart out, Leon.
And just how do you feel about these deer and antelope?
Do you know "Wind Beneath My Wings"?
The devil wasn't buying, by the sound of it.
Would you please refrain from calling it the Psych Office Dirge again?
Nice song. How does it make you feel?
I know you're struggling with abandonment issues, but not everybody is a doggie who is about to git along.
So that was the gift from your horse's mouth?
And can you tell me how that made you feel without the singing?
I'd like to start with a little something I wrote about my early years...
Play it Sam. You played it for her, you can play it for me.
I pronounce your cowboy conversion therapy 100% successful!
This next one is very personal.
Tell me again where you're from?
So . . . how long have you harbored this resentment toward your father for not being there the night you were drunk and your mother was released from prison?
Could you elaborate on your feelings behind “Yippy I Oh Ki-ah”?
So, Tex, how long have you been feeling lonesome?
Maybe try that in a major key
Perhaps you should try humming rather than strumming and stop stringing me along."
Apart from Dolly Parton, is there anyone -anyone at all that you dream about?
NO, playing the guitar with your left hand has nothing to do with your mother not loving you...
How about a song that doesn’t include your Mother .
Of course I love my mother. All cowboys do. What’s your point?
Yes, 'Home on the Couch' was the unofficial  anthem of Freud.
It wants to sound like a Banjo?
Well, partner, ya think we got one last song in us?
I will venture to say you're right-handed.
So your dog died and your'e in a relationship with your truck, but mama tried.
Then try this; 'Bill or George! Anything but Sue! '
So why do you think you dream about accordians?
So, you were sitting around a campfire eating beans and passing gas, and then what happened?
Tell me more about this place where the deer antelope play
So... last week you mentioned you were worried about the cattle?
So.....Her dog don’t bite nobody but you?
Given the number of specific references in your songs, is there more you  care to tell me about your 'little doggies' and 'Old Paint'?
This was a good session. Next week, how about you role-play Cher and ‘If I Could Turn Back Time.’
Let's go back to the size of her shoes.
This 'home on the range' sounds to me like an acute narcissistic delusion.
Yeah, but 'you're a lying, cheating SOB' still doesn't rhyme with 'orange.'
OK, Tex, so you say you're from Texas, but you're actually from Louisiana but you hated be called Louise, right?
Maybe it’s time to let the old ways die, Jedidiah...
Mr. Hardin, it could be more productive if you didn’t  play Y.M.C.A. the entire session.
What exactly do you mean when you say your wife is a “nag”?
Tell me more about the tumbling tumbleweeds.
You said that your mother strung you along?
Home, home of the strange.
I admit I didn't immediately recognize you Mr. President, but I do believe if you insist on putting out an album it could work against you.
So Willy, how long have you been sober?
Just pick your problem.
Instead of driving cattle, why don't we take a moment to discover what drives you?
Sometimes a long little dogie is just a long little dogie.
What about a session without instrumental accompaniment?
The bro-country fad should be over soon. Hang in there.
So, you sang it backwards, but still you didn't get back your wife, your home, your dog, and your car
I will need you to respond with more than 
a yodeling 'Yippie yi ooh, Yippie yi yay.'
Your hour is almost up but I think we can finish the song next week - and have time to discuss your writers block.
Or, you can sing about your childhood...
Well, why don't you try to use an 'I feel' song?
Subconsciously, you want to play the bassoon.
You're going to have to learn something other than Tosca.
Cain't seem to scare up a rhyme fer "psychotropic." It's gittin' me down!
Well, Tex, if she’s never even called you by your name, do you really expect her now to start calling you Darlin’?
How do you think YOU reduce the discouraging words?
Freebird!
.....and this began after you saw ‘The Ballad of Buster Scruggs’?
Have you tried changing your tone?
You say, that you come from Alabama with a banjo on your knee, but the problem is that, you're holding the wrong instrument!
Lets begin, go ahead  sing me a river
Let's explore your fixation with Home on the Range.
Sorry, not that kind of fine-tuning.
You say your hat was thrown back and your spurs were a jinglin'?  Interesting.
Let me get this straight, you are a Frito Bandito?
Uh-huh, let’s see - wife left you, truck broke down, dog died ... are there any happy, uplifting country songs?

So, how did it make you feel when you first found out there was no gold in them thar hills?

You dream you’re  performing at the Grand Ole Opry- how literally should I take this?
How do you feel the transition from Wall Street is going?
 Frank Buckley Andover, MA
It seems you are strung out.
Sing to me about your relationship with your mother.
Your left-handedness obviously has given you an inferiority complex and is making you sing these depressing songs.
I was sure the hat would cure the writer’s block.
But Tex, these feelings of abandonment are the natural result of your express desire for the little dogies to git along.
Have you considered cowboying up?
Have you thought about trading the Martin for a Fender?

Patient hears voices that are autotuned.
Let's discuss that last song, 'You Can't Go Home on the Range Again.'

What say you hand me the guitar and we trade places?
At least, we have facial hair in common.
...but have you ever thought to ask yourself "Am I ready for some football?"

I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue
I think we reached the point in your exposure therapy where you finally can touch a horse.
And how long have you had these feelings about "The Range?"
Yes, that was nice. But returning to your mother...

  Doc, and I need help.

May I suggest we go over 50 minutes and just call it a bonus track?
Now tell me what help your guitar needs.

'A Midsummer Night's Cowboy' IS catchy but...
Your problem is chronic yodeling.
And how did it make you feel when Hank’s horse kicked you in the head?

Pardon my Spanish Pedro, but that's loco.

So she saved the horse... how did that make you feel?
Are you still in the shallow?
Please stop throwing your broken strings on my rug

And when did these dreams about Willie Nelson begin?
Have you had thoughts of harming yourself or other folk?
So, tell me, when did you start dreaming that YOU were Willie Nelson"
Remember when we talked about you taking things too literally?  So, last time, I might have used some phrases like “get in tune with those around you,” “achieve harmony”, “get with the beat” . . .
Please, not 'Home on the Range' again.
This is the last tune that I write for you about your *!#%*! # hat.
When did you move to where the buffalo roam?

Do you feel singing about their misfortune helps you forget about your own?
How about these lyrics - "A Cowboy on couch in Manhattan, dreamed of his tush on a saddle of satin.......'
You're making real progress. Remember, the only way to overcome your fears is to confront them. From the top: Free Bird.
Tell me about the "ten dollar horse and forty dollar saddle."
Yes, but what happens when you sing that in reverse?
Medically speaking, it's actually probably better for your aching heart that you play that thing left-handed.
Play 'Melancholy Baby'
It seems to me, Tex, that you'd rather complain about it than actually go back to the lone prairie.
No, I don't think "where the deer and the antelope play" means you hate your mother.
I hear you...
I'm sorry, but I can't change my notes to lyrics for a country song...
Doc, I just can’t stop strumming her pain with my fingers

We must go beyond what happened when you rode to the ridge where the West commences.
I've lost my mojo.
So... you were gazing at the moon when you lost your senses?
Is it safe to say, you never went without your security blanket when you were a child?
HonkyTonk Blues?? Could you be more specific?
now, when you say it's "fucked up that john denver had never been to west virginia OR denver,"  do you feel that this is your father speaking? i agree by the way, it's wack as hell.
On the Rio Grande?
That was very good, very honest, but strum it by me again.
I didn't spend 12 years in college and graduate school to be a music therapist!
You don’t feel like pluckin’?
First, stop tuning to B, E, C, C, A.
I'm hoping you don't end up like Bradley Cooper in a "Star is Born"...
Was That, Depressed about "your country"...or "your country song"?
Your dad’s right, you’re a waste of space and can’t carry a tune, but you do pay my rent, til next week.
And how often do you experience this
performance anxiety?
I studied psychiatry,  by my mamas knee, underneath a tree, like my granddaddy
Explain to me again the comment "squeal like a pig"
...and would it kill her to put her laundry in the hamper once in a while?
That'll be $200,000 for today and will include my notes which are your next hit song.
Your therapy bill just went up.  I charge for notation.
Frankly I am more of a fan of Metallica
I sure hope your wife enjoys living home on the range as much as you do!
Before we start...I asked you to remove your boots...
I think if you can change your songs from Country-Western, you'll have a much more upbeat attitude.
Play me the one about your parents' separation.
So you can't stop playing 'Sweet Home Alabama'?
Less strum the more I  plumb.
It’s ok to come in alone. Leave the man with the hat home.
How do you feel about Indians?
We agreed that the first ‘merrily’ was mine - and don’t get me started on how pitchy it was.
What's the first thing that comes to mind when when I say, "Capo"?
Roscoe, face it, you're in denial
No, 'ritardando' doesn't mean stupidly, but it may mean you're slowing down.
Tell me about your struggles with barre chords.
Let's get back to the hornswogglers if we could.
Just why do you have tears in your ears?
Imagine if the genre hadn't chosen you. What would life look like if you had made all the choices?
And how do you feel being pegged in a specific genre?
No sir, I can not bill 23andMe directly for this therapy session.
Excuse me, why are you singing "O Sole Mio?
So I guess you're the strong, silent type.
That's a strum answer.
'The Ballad of the Antiathexis Cowpoke.' Go on.
And how did that make you feel?
I will honour the discount for singing.
I believe "lone prairie" is just a G chord.
I’m so sorry to hear that. Can you play “Wonderwall” next?
Sure, an ambiguous song about a broken G-string could be a country hit, but that question of moving on from your horse is one that only you can answer.
The next step in your de-sensitivity therapy is to sing 'Home on the Range'.
For starters,change careers immediately !
So, do you want to tell me about your troubles on the Old Chisholm Trail?
You can't go back.
These here notes from last session say nothin' bout playin' leftie like Paul McCartney.
So you say you played it til your fingers bled?  It was the summer of ‘69?
Your life will improve if you make it a show tune, instead.
Okay, okay.  Get along little dogie.
NOW can we get on with our session?
Virgil, I don't believe "Happy Trails" is an anti-aging song.
Alright!  I understand that you're depressed because you've lost your home where the buffalo roam, and the deer and the antelope play.
Hmmmm. Can you say more about the Rio Grande?
Behind the scenes with a singer-songwriter

Hourly fee doubled because of guitar.
When did you decide to sing in a minor key?
Can you play that Freud Chicken song?
And so you see how the 'Mama-guitar-old truck complex' begins in infancy . . .
This is terrible, when did you first start noticing the symptoms of populism.
Maybe you’ll feel better if you speak with a fiddle instead.
OK, Doc, but I don't hear the phrase '"A true example of Narcissistic Paranoia" working any better as a Viennese waltz.
Country music is still relevant
SIR GO AND PLAY ELSEWHERE ALLOW ME TO CONCENTRATE ON WRITING
You say you crossed the bridge but you keep coming back to the same complaint.
Maybe switch to polka music.
Sorry to crush your ego, but you will probably never be referred to as a "cowman."
SO you say your mother left with your dog ?
Sorry Shooter, bluesy campfire songs cannot be applied against your deductible, but providing assistance with my son's admission into Cowboy U, well that's another story.
Yes, I have a PhD in twang.
A little largo and a little more allegro.
And... watch me for the changes.

So, how long have you been feelin’ lonely on the old prai-rie ?
Your problem might be solved with grated floors for the roaming buffalo.
OK, so you're happy with "Home on the Range" wherever it happens to be?!
You never say what
“All we gotta do is”,
is.
You love your mom, you hate your dad.  Interesting song.  What does it mean?
Have you tried pretending the stage is your horse?
I remember the thrill when I first heard a guitar but my parents wanted me to be a Dr
Why does throwing the hoolinan mean so much you?
That song," Lulu, you're my one and only," was true? And the relationship ended when her mother caught you and her being intimate . It was Bucky who removed the bell from her neck so she could sneak up on you, and that's why you shot him?
So, Mother wants to know if  Little Doggies really get along all that well.
This next one is about performance anxiety, I think you'll dislike it.
Arcadian Stereotypes.
Who would you say is your spirit diva?
Mmm, if  I hum it, can you strum it?
Doc, I don’t just sing the blues.
Ever since the 
D-I-V-O-R-C-E I’ve been 
L-O-N-E-L-Y
I think you would be happier if you switched to K-Pop.
My recommendation this week is to back up the music on your MySpace profile.
Now that we have the sad cowboy shtick locked down, should we work on the second verse?
So, you blame your mother for your career choice?
How many times are you going to sing that story?
Maybe the real scuttlin’ June bug a’twistin’ in the wind...is your own heart.

Any numbers about last night's dream?
So, your mama didn’t believe Willie Nelson?
I repeat that your problem is way beyond that "get along little dogie."

Honest to God, Doc.  Their brands were still on fire!  And, their hooves were made of steel!
And you say all the antelope left...?
Yeah, I've heard that 'I'm an Old Cow Hand' from you about 50 times. Wanna move on to what's really bothering you? Although, I must say, I'm not trained to deal with hemorrhoids.
I may have some idea of why your legs aren't tan.
Now when you say "yonder" are your referring to your mother or father?
dying with your boots on may or may not be caused a Freudian slip
Yes. Here it is: The dogie hesitation, lonesome contemplation blues... With paranoid features.
So, exactly how long has it been since you saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs?
That’s lonesome there, not lonely, Cowboy!
The guitar is OK.  Sometimes even a banjo is just a banjo."
I know your an old Cowhand, lets here more about the Rio Grand!
How is playing  “Seven Spanish Angels”  a sign of remorse?
Unbowed legs and untanned cheeks; I think you're in crisis about being a cowhand.
Just because you wrote one uplifting song, doesn't mean you're depressed.
No, I didn't mean that kind of jam-packed session."
So your mother was a coyote. I've heard the tall tales. Enough with the pathos, Bill.

Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such...
I can promise you cloudless skies in here the buffalo are roaming two blocks over.

Was this your mother’s favorite song?
You say that you're an old hand. Where did you say you were from?
Tell me more about your home on the range.  Tell me more about Mother.

Doc,  Give me a home, where the buffalo roam, and I don't see a human all day
It started when the wheat fields and the clothes lines and the and the junkyards and the highways came between us.

In your music I hear a lack of cathexis of the narcissistic libido to modern Life.
And how did you feel about the horse's being dead, too?
So, your wife left you, and your dog died, and you need to quit drink'in".  Sounds like an awful country song to me
That you keep playing that horrible tune tells me you have a severe case of passive aggression.
Home on The Range and Don't Fence Me In...that's progress.  I have confidence you'll be able to learn Tumbling Tumble Weeds and Ghost Riders in the Sky for our next session.
Let's get drunk and raw dog it.
So your saying you need “a home with a roaming buffalo” ? Hmmmmm
You had a tear in your beer?  And how does that make you feel?
How about you ride the horse, and I save the cowboy?
So you say you don't know who they think they are, smashing a perfectly good guitar?

OCD, ADHD, GAD, PTSD and BiPolar 2. Zanax, as needed
I don't care about your damn pickin'. How do you feel?
So your mother was a poor girl from Guantanamera, and she sang to you when you were growing up in Kalamazoo ...

So your girl gone up and left you ....your dog gone up and died ANDyou burnt the toast ?
Your time is up. Would you prefer I bill iTunes?

It appears to me like he’s pulling your strings and winding you up too tight
So how does that make you feel that it's out of tune?
So you're saying that you never even made it to Nebraska before he broke your banjo?
That was interesting but I need to understand who YOU are, not Kenny Rodgers
But your achy breaky heart would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness
You have a severe case of the Hank Williams complex.
I want your therapeutic experience to be comfortable, but we just can't do campfires in the office to for you to tell your whole story.

When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
If you don't want to be a "Lonesome Cowboy", maybe you should dress like one?
Enough Waltzing Matilda,
I asked for a Viennese Waltz.
Six months of yodel di, yodel dum is enough!
And howdy’s that make you feel?
You came alone to a couples counseling meeting? I told my wife to save a horse, and ride a cowboy. She chose the horse.

Note to self: This is the moment I can either make or break this singin’ cowboy’s career.
For my next song, I'll play "The Bookcase Blues."
I’m told your horse had a delusion in my reception area.
Now, are you gonna tell me how you feel or are you gonna try to be the next Johnny Cash?
It's not so rare as you'd think. You've got Singing Dude Syndrome, Strum Version.
Let's rap.
This office will not be big enough for the two of us
You think YOU have daddy issues...
okay so remembering lyrics is a problem... any problem remembering who your singing to.
Maybe opera would be a better choice for your guitar style.
I think it's time we move past Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.
whoa Nelly
This next exercise will involve you singing it out.
This one is for the shrink I adore.
I have heard that tune over and over again. Let's talk about that imaginary Penguin.
And how did having tears in you ears from lying on your back make you feel?
I appreciate that you think we are making progress, but I would rather not be refereed to as the "June to your Johnny."
You're bearing quite a heavy burden, would you like to repeat that refrain?"
I appreciate the empathy, but we’re here to talk about the happiness of *your* trails.
Don't....forsake....me....oh....my ...darling. It sounds like this is coming from the superego.
Maybe if you sing backwards you’ll get back Lucille and the Chevy PickUp

So let me get this straight. You want me to sing, "We're brothers from the same mother. Somos hermanos de la misma madre. We grew up here together. Por favor, no nos separe," at your ICE hearing next week? And you're gonna play your guitar?
Have you always been so low?
So you think the panic attacks began when your father threw you out of your home on the range?

You said this cowboy look started when you grew a beard?
Shouldn't you be at home right now?
There's a tear in my beer Sigmund.
As a Freudian I am bound by my oath to say that although your song is on its face about "Sweet Sandee My Own" it is actually about your penis substitute with which you continuously, yea even now, play with your hands...
Don’t fret; hold your headstock up high.
Have you tried playing your music backwards?
And if we create a megahit, will I be listed as the co-author and producer?

Unplugging live wires to the past was a metaphor.

Give me land, lots of land, 'neath the starry skies above . . .
It’s difficult to analyze why you fret so much about our sessions.

Stop stringing me along.
Yes, I think Buckaroo Freud would like your tribute.
Fella,  since you were born on the right side of the tracks,  give up trying to write a good blues song.
Song song blue, everybody knows one!

At least it isn't an atypical emotional attachment.
So you always end up playing Purple Haze and the Star Spangled Banner
Yes, it does get lonely in those hills
I'm thinking barter system.
It’s my lonely heart, doc.
So, you're angry at your Mama because ever since you were a baby she didn't want to let you grow up to be a Cowboy?"
So, this aura starting to surround us- Does it only occur when you play the guitar?
And that was when I decided to become a cowboy.
Well, I think my problems stem back in time, when my horse and my cattle were my only companions......
Let’s see...your woman left you, the government is taking your ranch, and your doggies are lost on the range...I’m getting mighty tired of your hard luck stories.
What makes you say you're out of tune with Maggie Six-String?
It's perfectly fine to play guitar left-handed. Just ask Jimi Hendrix. Oh wait, he's dead."

I’m a lone cowhand.
Let's talk about your relationship with Ole Pokey without the music.
Tell me about your earlier career as a ukulele player. Like, before you became a famous guitarist.

It's time to get some new strings.

And was this a shooting range ?
So, you’re saying that feel like you’re a lone cowpoke?
Dave, your ballads are not necessarily enmity; they are merely misused and made occasions for enmity.
You see...let me tell you a little ditty about Jack and Diane....
Thanks for the compliment, Lester, but I'm not 'cookin' anything up with you, and I find the question to be highly inappropriate.

Well, do you want to get out of the shal-la-la-lows?
I'm thinking split personality already. It's when you can't concentrate on one thing a a time.
Well Mr. Gibbons, you seem to be suffering from a temporary form of Delusional Disorder. ‘She Got Legs’ is not a cowboy song and is not about your horse.
If you want a record deal, perhaps you should sing something other than ballads.
I'll see your 6 strings, 4 divorces, and 3 addictions, and I'll raise you a DSM-5 and tons of Schedule 2 drugs.
Can you play a song about your id?

Is Lonesome Cowboy really the only song you know?
I am an old woman, named after my mother...

Home on the Range has already been written.
Please sing to me why you miss your horse.
It would sound lots better if you used a left-handed guitar.
Agreed.  It's a long day, when you've got nothing to do --- in Texas.
I don’t know why nobody told you how to unfold your love.
Sorry, but the hat clearly said, "Hufflepuff".
I’m sorry, but I don’t speak music.
I feel like I’m just twiddling my thumbs all the time.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin' , oh my darlin' Tex Cline,
Please tell me, please tell me, tell me what is on your mind.
This is no time to be horsing around.
Yep,I'm learning to play the guitar that she left me when she rode my horse into the sunset.
Now what's the next line after, "My dog died near the trailer?"
Please, not another dusty road song!
Talk more about growing up with Mother, who could never seem to cut the chord.
Out in the west Texas town of El Paso...

Your legs ain't bowed but your mood is low. Yippie yi yo kayah.
Have you told The Pico Kid  about your feelings?
It seems to me you never had to learn how to deal with criticism constructively.
Please play a few bars of "Home On the Range" and tell me what you're feeling about it.
It’s okay that you believe in reincarnation....The way you sing and play guitar makes me agree that in your prior life you were the Singing Cowboy, Gene Autry.
Are you sure you wouldn’t rather use a ukulele?
I thought all you country western singers are either looking for love or are depressed
You're telling me THAT got you a long little doggy?
``I'm just gonna write that you lived without electricity in your biography''
I can help with everything but finding your stolen truck.


G Blundell. Nanaimo , B C

You need to face the facts Mr. Eubanks;
You are NOT Marie Antoinette.  You are Tammy Wynette
We need to find a good stressor for you.
Tell me why you keep playing “Lonesome Cowboy”?

This week, let's try combining music therapy and poetry therapy.
Sorry, I help acrophobiacs, not anachronisms.
Let's start by your hearing about your childhood home on the range.  Singing is optional.
Play something that best reflects your mood.
You say you have a case of the blues?
Yippee yi yo kayah" just doesn't work as a #hashtag Roy
Could you give me a walking bass line for this part?
And were your family people who had specific musical preferences?
Nobody told you, you couldn't sing in tune? Sad.
Don't sing you answers to me.
Joe, I'm sorry to inform you that the buck stops here.
Good, and if you ever find yourself listening to country radio, just repeat your mantra: "Florida Georgia Line is not the herald of the Apocalypse. Florida Georgia Line is not . . ."
No!  You cannot marry that guitar.
What can you sing for me about your mother?
They're all outta rhinestones, and I'm gitten' mighty depressed!

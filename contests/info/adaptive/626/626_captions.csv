About to land now, call you when I'm on the ground.
No, I can’t hold on.
Test driving a new mustang, what are you up to?
Turns out this IS my first rodeo.
Hi Hon. Can you meet me at the hospital in about ten minutes?
No, I said I'm getting BUCKED, with a B.
I'm in the air right now; let me call you back after I land.
You’re absolutely right, dear – the rattlesnake ringer tone was not a good idea!
On second thought, let's add the accident coverage.
No, I said 'bucked', though on second thought you may be right.
Hang on, I think I'm being dropped by my carrier.
Hi, I’d like to add a rider to my insurance policy.
This is so relaxing after working in the White House.
Siri, what’s the safest way to fall from a horse?
Fire that idiot in purchasing. Get me a CHEVY Bronco and for Heaven's sake CANCEL MY WIFE'S JAGUAR!!
Yeah! Ironically this was the last item on my bucket list.
And how would you suggest I hold my horses?
And you say my coverage is effective immediately?” ... “Excellent.
The Uber only said "Brown Bronco"!!
Pre-existing conditions? Not yet.
Hold on!--it's just a dead zone.
I should be landing shortly
You now have my unbridled attention.
No, seriously, I really DO need to see a man about a horse.
Well actually, it is my first rodeo!
Sorry. Butt dial.
Let me get back to you -- things are kind of up in the air right now.
Hang on a sec. I have to take this fall.
Let me call you back. I’m about to land.
Hey, I lasted longer than most of Trump’s appointees!
I dunno.  He didn't seem to like it when I put the coins in.
no, no...i’m getting bucked... with a ‘b’
Let me call you back.  I'm just about to land.
Whoa!  The buck stops here!
I may lose you in a second.
I’m just leaving filly but I’ll call you when I’m on the ground.
Whatever amount I can get without a physical.
This isn't even the horse I rode in on!
My hiccups are gone!
No, YOU get off your high horse!
Oh, just test-driving a new Bronco.
Hold on, I think I just heard a discouraging word."
I found where the buck stops!
You're kidding!  You wanted me to get a scallion?
It's frickin' WYOMING dude, and I can't believe I'm getting a signal!
oh up and down - how is it going with you?
I'm calling regarding directions to your emergency room.
Like an i-Phone cowboy....
Honey, I found the perfect horse for your mother.
I'm about to break up - I'll call you back
Landing soon — call you when I’m on the ground.
Siri, closest orthopedist.
I’ve fallen and I can’t giddyup
I think he must have heard a discouraging word.
No, I do not have a pre-existing condition.
Hello...  No, I CAN'T hold on!
I think I'm about to lose my signal.
LIMERICK: Once a fella named Hyden...While sittin on a horse that was glidin...He was thrown from the roan...While usin his phone...A classic case, distracted ridin.
Oh, nothin' much. Makin' a fast buck. You?
Got to go now ! I'll call when I land !
No, I can talk. How's my favorite client?
Quick and importante question: is Obamacare still a thing?
This is DEFINITELY not Buttercup !!!
No, no, no, I said I was totally BUCKED!
If you’re hurtling through the air having been bucked from your horse and haven’t yet hit the ground, press 1.
No, I'm pleased! I was just thrown off because I didn't expect your call.
I might lose you here in a second.
Guess what, Mom.  I made pardner.
Who put the rattlesnake ring tone on my phone?!
Sorry, I'm about to hit the road.
I don’t know when I’ll be home, honey. My life coach told me to keep getting back on the horse until I have self-esteem or a spinal injury.
I should have asked Rudy.  He knows how to stay close to a horse’s ass.
I love this cowboy life. The open skies, the wind in my hair, the ground rushing toward my face.
I'll get back to you as soon as I land.
I'm wondering if you have any appointments available this afternoon
Doing great! Finally getting the big bucks!
Hold on. I'm about to lose you.
I’m thinking this could be my big break.”
Well,if it isn't one bucking thing after another!
I'll call you back as soon as I've landed.
You’ll be glad to hear I’m finally off my high horse.
No, I can't just hang on.
Gotta go, sweetie.  I'll call you from the ER.
Hey, it's me - can I still change my vote on Medicare?
How quickly can you sign me up for your most comprehensive health care plan?
Oh yes—sure we can do brunch! How does Monday at Mount Sinai work for you?
Larry?! I musta butt-dialed you!
I’ll have to call you back, my ride is dropping me off.
I'll soon find out where the buck stops.
I'm rethinking my bucket list.
OK, I tried the whispering thing but it's not working.
I'll call you from the hospital.
Yahoo! I lasted longer than Scaramucci!
Siri, break my fall.
“Sorry, I have to take this fall.”
The Mercedes is in the garage.  I took the Bronco.
Uber sent me a Mustang.
Guess who just got off his high horse.
This IS in fact my first rodeo.
Yes honey, I did get back on the horse.
It’s OK.  I’m not driving.
Whispering didn't work. Any more bright ideas?
Hey, guess what?  I'm going to finally meet my health insurance deductible this year!
Gotta go. I'll call you when I land.
That's right, no pre-existing condition.
Of course I'm not texting while driving; I'm not an idiot!
Check Instagram in 5 seconds.
I'm at the office. Why do you ask?
Delete 'stable genius' from my profile!
Alexa, bring me a first aid kit.
Actually this IS my first rodeo.
I'd be happy to hold on.
He get's very upset when I take calls while riding.
I’d love to talk some more, but I’ve got 911 on hold.
Give me a sec. I’m just getting dropped off my Uber now.
I'll be landing shortly.
No, I really can't hold.
He found out I voted for Trump
To restart your jump press 1, for a lower hurdle press 2, to speak with an instructor press 3, and for an ambulance press 4.
It’s more dignifying, stable and safer than my last job at the White House.
Hang on,  I'm about to break up.
Hold on - I may be going into a dead zone.
Look, I’ll have to call you back.  I’m about to go into a dead zone.
I’ll have to call you back after I land.
This is WAY better than the branding seminar.
Can I call you back? I'm training for my new job with the Trump administration.
You know me. Still just horsing around.
Yeah, and then I told him, "the only way I'd vote Trump is if I had a head injury!"
Beam me up Scotty. Now!
Can you hold for a second, I’ve got to take an important fall.
So then I go and look this darn gift horse right in the mouth.
I should never have taken this gallup poll!
I'm kind of up in the air right now. I'll get back to you.
I'm going to need an ambulance in 0.8 seconds.
no, no, no, with a B!
Siri, where's the nearest hospital?
Can I get back to you? I’m sorta between a bronc and a hard place.
No, relax dear! I said I'm getting bucked.
Can’t talk now, I’m taking off.
I'm flying at the moment.  I'll call you back when I land.
No, NOT metaphorically speaking!
No honey, I said he's bucking me.
Hi Honey! Just wanted to thank you for sending me to the Dude Ranch. Tell the kids I loved them.
Siri, what's another word for woa?
Hold on, I gotta go hands-free for a second...
I may have bought the wrong kind of mustang for my midlife crisis.
It’s fine. I have a screen protector.
Yes I'm riding! A lot of people tell me i'm the best rider ever.  It's a great ride.
Everything's fine, Mom!
I just got up in the air, I call you when I land.
No,I said hang on a second I have to take this fall
I have a few balls in the air right now
Siri -- call 911
I'll call you back as soon I land.
I'm just horsing around. And you?
Even horses find Millenials annoying.
Yeah, and the skies have been cloudy all day!
No, I'm hands-free!
I've got to go; some clown is headed over here to talk to me.
Yup, hands free!
Glad you called, I'd actually love to talk about life insurance.
Gosh, I'm sorry - I must have butt-dialed you.
Babe, it's my first time to last eight seconds."
I DID get right back on again, you idiot! Tell the damn horse next time!
I think I'm changing carriers.
Hang on, I'm just about to land.
No YOU hang up first!
No, Mom, always have time to talk to you
I'll be fine. It's not my first rodeo,Bill.
After a stint at the White House, Sean opted for a less tumultuous occupation.
Hey, Bob! Glad I caught you! Can you swing by and pick me up in about two seconds?
Yes, Mr. President, I've just been preparing for my new cabinet position.
It was a spur of the moment decision.
That was the moment Doug realized he had to choose between bronco busting and telemarketing.
Don’t be silly, Mom. I would NEVER text while driving!
' No, no; I said I'm getting BUCKED!"
Honey, we are about to meet our deductible!
I need to go, I'm about to land.
Hi, I would like to place an order for pick up.
Yeah I can hold but not for long.
I'll call you back. We're about to land.
No...This IS my first rodeo!
Of course I’m not driving!
Oh, nothing... You?
I'll have to get back to you, right now I'm up in the air.
Not much, just horsing around. You?
Alexa- get me a FORD Mustang!
People are gonna love this: it completely takes your mind off the President!
Hilarious! She actually said technology’s making us oblivious to the world around us? Hey, hold on a sec, I got another call coming in...
Well, it's a lot like my divorce, but this time I'm getting bucked.
I've gotten six likes on my video already!
I have to hang up. I'm about to land.
Hey Siri, call 911
No. No pre-existing conditions.
I said hell yeah I want the one named Widomak--
Still beats Spirit Airlines.
Daddy can't talk, sweetie. He's still in the air.
No,no, I said I'm having a "bucking" good time.
Sure I've got a second to chat.  Well, maybe less.
Can I call you back? I'm falling off a horse right now.
Wow Sal, I bet I get a million likes from this...
Imagine FaceTime meets Google Earth...
Hey, hon. Can you pick up some milk and a neck brace on the way home?
I said . . .  I just got BUCKED, dear.
Hold on a sec, I gotta take this fall.
Well, I guess the buck stops here.
No...I said  I’m BUCKED! But now that you mentioned it....
No, everything's great here.  It's been a breeze since I left the White House.
No Siri, not help with a divorce, horse. How do you ride a horse."
Let me call you back,I'm just landing.
So I sez “Why the long face?”
I’m on my way down right now.
The Bronco that's parked behind the house? That makes more sense.
I'd like to report rodeo rage.
Well, I tried to plug in the phone to charge it and he just went nuts!
Oops! I must have buck dialed you!
I'm going to lose you, my carrier just dropped me.
I’d like to return a horse
I'll call you back. I'm breaking up.
Hello, Emergency room?  I'm calling to make a reservation . . .
My ride's just dropping me off now... I'll be right down.
Honey, remember that fortune cookie that promised a lucky break for me?
Quick, sign me up for the platinum health plan.
Are you kidding? Wild horses couldn’t keep me away?”
No; it's not THAT bad.  I said I just got BUCKED.
Hello, 911? I'm going to need an ambulance.
Siri, find orthopedic surgeons near me.
Me? Training to be press secretary? You?
Hey, Siri. How do you ride a bucking bronco?
Hon, my phone is about to die.
I need to get off now. Bye!
Hi!  I'm gonna need a wheel chair, back brace and a pair of Depends in about three seconds.
So you recommend two hands on the reins?
It's been a wild ride, but I find myself going in a different direction.
Hello, 9-1-1? I'm going to need an ambulance in about 3... 2...
It's the journey, not the destination!
I should go. I'll be landing soon.
No! No! No!  I said I just got bucked!
No, I can't hold.
He probably thought I said "Buck!"
No, it's billed as actual reality. Whatever that is.
If you're looking for an experienced fall guy, I'm your man.
Hold on---I'm losing my connection .
I’ll call you back, I’m about to break up.
Gotta run now. I'll text you when I get to the ER.
Daddy can’t talk right now, sweetie.  Can you call Mommy?
I guess the buck does stop here.
Falling off a horse is easy. It's the landing I'm worried about.
I must've butt dialed!
Hey, can I call you back when I regain consciousness?
Best selfie ever!
My therapist says it’s an unconscious desire to relive my days in the administration.
No, it's the other way around: I'm on the horse's bucket list.
You were right, he hates the name Horsey McHorseFace!
I finally get to work in a stable environment!
Well ,I am falling to my death. How are you doing ?
Gotta go.  No more minutes left.
Can I call you back?  I’m about to break up.
Thanks so much for booking this - super authentic!
Ok honey I'm finally getting off my high horse!
Well, it was only a MID-life crisis about five seconds ago.
Let me call you back. About to have some downtime.
Ok, I got back on the horse that threw me.”
Hold on, I’m about to become a meme.
Can you meet me at the hospital?  I'm on my way there now.
Yay...I'm getting the handicapped spot at the office!
Let me call you back when I land.
No no — BUCKING Bronco — with a B!
Hi, can we make this brief?"
It’s on my calendar, but wild horses may keep me away.
He says neigh to your offer.
NO, I said I just got bucked!
Oh, just the same old same old.  You?
I'd like that life insurance policy to be effective immediately, thanks.
Hang on. I'm just landing.
Hold on a minute -- I need to take a selfie.
Funny you should say I sound "hoarse.
No, honey, I said I'm getting 'Bucked.'
No, no, I said bucking, dear.
I have to hang up, we're about to land.
Can you speak up? I'm in a mid-life crisis.
Hello, Mattress King?  How fast can you deliver?
Nothing throws me since I discovered Zoloft.
He's a stable genius.
My mom always said I should get a stable job.
This reminds me of the time I got on my wife and called her another woman's name.
My plans are a bit up in the air right now.
Gotta go, I'm about to land
I’ll call you when I land.
Oh, just breaking in my new mustang ... and you?
I’ve changed my mind, I do believe in coverage for pre-existing conditions.
I think I need to switch carriers.
Yes. This is a good time to talk about my health provider.
One sec. I'm about to enter a dead zone.
Can I call you right back in a couple months?
Honey, I'm still on the wagon, it's the horse I fell off, the horse .
Sorry, I can't talk right now.  Why don't you call back when I'm home from the hospital?
No, I have no pre-existing conditions!
It'll hurt, but I'll finally meet my deductible.
Thanks for suggesting the gunshot ringtone.
And then I said...over my dead body"
Getting back on the saddle after falling off a horse sounded easier in my shrink’s office.
You know what they say - never a horse that couldn't be rode, never an actuary that couldn't be throwed.
What? Nothing. Just horsing around.
The new job sounds great. How are the medical benefits?
Oh, you know...same old, same old.
I'm talking big bucks, Jenkins, truly big bucks.
Siri, where is the closest emergency room?
Technically, I also have a self-driving vehicle.
Got to go. I'll call you as soon as I land."
Oh, you know, just getting the big bucks!
Wait a second, I have to get a selfie.
I'm fucked, how are you?
Yeah,well,things are up in the air right now.
My plans are currently up in the air.
I've  just been thrown from a horse and you want me to press One for more options??
Hold on, I have to take this fall.
No, I'm laughing because the cartoon artist drew me as if I was jumping from the fence over the horse -- clearly not familiar with the physics of getting thrown off a horse!
"Yippee ki...uh-oh!"
OK Google. Orthopedic ...
How about now? Can you hear me now?
Things are a little up in the air right now.
I’ll call you later. Things are kind of up in the air.
Hold on, I'm about to land
So then my therapist tells me I should really unplug and get back to nature, and I’m like...
I’m talkin’ BIG bucks, Harold!
I'll have to get back you on that, I'm kinda up in the air right now.
I will be landing shortly, may I call you back
Sorry, I gotta hang up and hit the road.
What do you mean they only commissioned you to draw the one panel?
I lasted longer than Scaramucci!
Finally, Reception!
Yes Doctor, I can feel a sort of Un-bridled happiness these days.
Either get off the damn phone or get off me!
And then the bartender says, "Why the long face?"
I'm working on my buck-it list.
Of course I can talk about our relationship 
Wild horses couldn’t drag me away
No, I said ‘Buck Off!’
Honey, I just finished my buck-it list!
It's great. I've really learned to let go out here.
Yup, back in the sad...
Oh hi, Honey.  Can I call you back after I land?
Yep Jim, I’m looking at the presentation right now.
Same old, same old. How about you?
He wouldn't start, so I put a quarter in his slot.
No... I am not calling from my car... I'm smarter than that!
Hold on, I've got to take this fall.
Have you tried unplugging and plugging it back in?
No, seriously! I'm multitasking right now!
Well, the joke’s on them. I didn’t sign the liability form!
Let me get back to you.  I'm up in the air right now.
Huh. Guess who's ticklish?
Honey, I am about to land - see you soon.
Things are a little up in the air now
I'll call back, maybe.
Can you pick me up?
It’s no Uber, but it only costs a buck.
...don't get on what?
The Horse and the Ass.
Great! I'll call you as soon as I touch down.
When you said that, it really threw me off.
Who says men can't multitask ?
Are you sure I should get right back on? I was thinking more about an ambulance.
Of course I'm using "hands free"!
You'll never believe it: our energy drinks work on horses, too!
This isn't what you meant by, 'get off your high horse'?
Sounds like the coverage plan for me. Any wiggle room on the pre-existing conditions clause?
I must’ve put the quarter in the wrong slot!
OK, fine, got it.  Now step two- Hold on to what??
What’s up? Funny you should ask.
Why yes, this IS my first rodeo.
... with pepperoni.
Sorry!  I accidentally buck called you!
I think this strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy.
Hey, honey.  I'm still in the air.  I'll let you know when I on the ground
This will blow goat yoga out of the water!
I watched a "how to" video on YouTube, so I'm pretty sure I'm okay.
I’ll call you back as soon as we land.
You know me, just horsing around!
You mean I don't have cancer....that's great news!
Sorry, I can't hold.
Can you get this onto YouTube before I hit the ground?
Help!  I’m about to fall and almost certainly will be unable to get up.
I'll take this any day of the week over a cabinet post.
I told him he's not going out to stud after all.
It looked a lot easier on Urban Cowboy...
No, this is a good time.  What's up?
Text and drive? What kind of bozo do you think I am?
Obviously, the buck does not stop here.
Yes, this is he.
So, I told the guy, who needs health insurance?
Wow! I didn't think I could get a signal out here!
No, I said it was a BUCKING bronco!
That had better not be a discouraging word I'm hearin'.
Hold on, I might be entering a dead zone.
Sorry, I was on mute. Can everyone hear me shriek in fear now?
Jim's unique approach to 'work hard, play hard' was about to reach a hard conclusion.
Then after lunch we went horseba.....
Actually, I can't hold.
So I  said to the Genie, "Turn my wife into a horse I can ride."
Honey, I quit my job, dropped some acid, and went to the cowboy bar... Honey?
And I said, "How tough can it be? I've seen Urban Cowboy THREE times..!!"
This ain't my first ro.... Alright, you got me, it is my first rodeo.
Let's talk later. I'm about to hit the hay.
Hey, glad I got ya. Second thought I will take that major medical insurance upgrade.
Alright, I might lose you here in a second
Yep, we'll do anything to get into the New Yorker Magazine!
I'm sorry. I must've buck dialed you.
No, I said I'm seriously bucked.
Can you hear me now?
It's WAY more exciting than the brochure.
Honey, I bought the farm!
Did I catch you at a bad time?
I knew I shouldn’t text and ride.
So you say get right back on?
Yes, dear. I'm off to a flying start.
Apparently Dusty hates my ringtone.
No, go ahead, I can talk
Nothing to it. Just like falling off a bike.
I'll have to get back to you. My plans are a bit up in the air right now.
I’ll call you later from the hospital
Can't talk now, Babe - call you as soon as I land.
Actually no, I can't hold on for a second.
OK, Make it quick.  I only have eight seconds.
Same old rodeo. How about you?
I'll have to call you back.  I'm about to hit pay dirt.
I'll text you when I land.
I think I might be breaking up soon
No, YOU hold yer horses!
Hey Siri, what’s the best way to land from 15 hands high?
Everything is up in the air right now.
How soon can you deliver that mattress?
Ha Ha! The joys of getting the big bucks.
I said I'd call you back in eight seconds!
Hi! Sorry, i must have saddle dialed you!
It’s easier than working at the White House.
Gotta go...call you back when I land!
Hey man, I'll call you back when I land.
I'll call you right back. We are about to land.
I'm kinda in the middle of something right now!
Sorry, I only have a second.
Jerry was quite pleased he lasted as long as he did on the bronc known simply as "the Donald".
Well, actually it's a lateral move.
Not a problem. I am just landing.
Hello Monica, you're right.  It is surprisingly easy to fall off a horse.
Hey I’m about to land - can I call you back?
I need to cancel on golf tomorrow... my back is about to go out.
You do? I'm head over heels too!
Hello, Uber? About this ride you sent me....
Well, I'm taking off now so I'll call you when I land, ok?
Ha ha, no! I said “buck” off!
Hello Aflac
If I get kicked off, I'll call you back
I am hands free
What are you driving these days? I've got a new Mustang.
Call it a mid-life crisis if you like, but I love my mustang!
Recalculating . . .
No, I can't hold on a minute.
. . . and they wanted me to wear one of those dorky riding helmets!
Guess what, doc? No more fear of falling!
Brokeback Mountain.  The Musical.
Wait a sec, I want to get a selfie of this.
Look, I'm still up in the air on this. Can I call you back?
I'm falling and I can't hang up.
Siri, dial 911.
" Hold on a second until I land.
Well, I guess I’d better get off now.
Who came up with this horse yoga idea?
Actually, you called at a great time!
Make it quick. I only have a second.
I told him about a jackass I met at Mar el Lago.  He misunderstood.
Yes, the buck definitely stops here!
Yes, I'd like to order a neck brace, crutches, and a hospital bed, please?
Just calling to make sure this is really a prerequisite for being a White House correspondent?
Gotta go honey, I’m about to hit the hay.
You're breaking up and I think I may be too.
Siri  Ambulance please!
Good news, honey, I just checked another one off my bucket list.
Up in the air for the moment.  You?
It's not like this is my first rodeo, Bob.
Is it posted on my Instagram yet?"
Sorry mister, but there is no such thing as a free ride.
Can the doctor see me this afternoon?
Cremation! I’ve decided on cremation!
Hello Ford?  My new Mustang is riding a little rough.
Sure, I'll hold.
Got to go. I'm about to have Face Time with the ground....
Guess I should have called Uber
This must be the Dude Ranch .I guess I should be next door  at the Subdued  Ranch .
I've got to get off now.
Yes ! This is my first rodeo !
I guess the buck stops here!
That's hilarious! Oh, hang on, I have to switch to hands-free.
Guess I should have gotten the hands-free option.
Have to let you go; I'll soon be breaking up.
Yes, I want to complete my medical insurance application.
I'm finally living life in the moment! Hold on. I have another call.
Hold on. I think I' m going to be breaking up!
I'm down to my last buck.
Nah, I'm good. The law only applies to distracted driving.
Just called to say that I now agree. Whoever said "Get back on that horse" is an idiot.
So she told ME that I was oblivious to my surroundings. Hilarious!
Seriously, this is the most in control I’ve felt in years
She doesn't like me to use the phone while I'm driving.
Free up my calendar for the next ten months.
Honey, watch the video I am going to send you.  And then call Dr. Shultz for me.
Ha! Your phone message kinda threw me off!
Tell marketing I'm still up in the air about the rattlesnake ringtone.
I got the name for our new website...YAHOO.COM
You were right. This horse hates cell phone users.
I’ll have to call you back.  It’s been a wild ride.
Hi, oh nothing much, how about you?
hi dear, i'm just about to hit the road....can i pick up something for dinner?
Nothing. Just horsin' around.
Well, it is my first rodeo.
Just horsing around.  How about you?
I said NEW factory!  Not GLUE factory!
Yeah, I'm free now.
No darling, I've definitely learned my lesson; no more texting and driving!
Honey! I finally got a signal!
Great news honey!  I think I'm almost over my mid-life crisis.
I have to hang up for landing.
Hold on you say?
Hi, Dad.  Just calling to say you were right. If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it."
It's not bad - almost the same as living under the current presidency.
Hello, 911?
Honey, I got the selfie!
Watch me nail the landing
Now’s a good time to talk, and maybe again in six months.
Can I call you back. I'm at work and things are a little up in the air.
No, you hang up.  No, you.
Well, I am in Colorado but I’m not that kind of high right now.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you when I land.
Sure, I’ll take the survey.
How does your plan define a "pre-existing condition"?
Yeah, the dude ranch is fun, honey. Yes, I'm being careful.
Wait, what's the emoji for 'broken neck'?
Can you hold on a sec? I have to take this fall.
Harvey?  The results of the Galloping Poll just came in!
Woo hoo, lasted longer than Priebus!
Actually, now's a GREAT time to take your survey.
Technically it's my second, but it feels like my first.
I'm really into buying experiences instead of stuff.
Hi Hon!  The executive dude ranch is great. By the way, did you remember to pay health insurance premium this month
No roaming charges?  Really?
Can you hang on a sec?  I think I just took another picture of my ear.
I'll call you back from the emergency room!
I may be late for dinner
No, this is not a good time!”
It's OK. I'm hands-free.
I’ll be landing any moment.
Let me get back to you as soon as I've landed.
My will is in the upper left-hand drawer.
I'll send you the pics as soon as I land.
What was Step 3 again?
So then I said, "Hold my beer and watch this...".
Hi mom.  
Mmm hmm.  
That's nice. 
Nope, nothing new with me.
You’re Pregnant?
Nothing much, how about you?
I'll call you from the "ER" !!
I’ll have to call you back, I’m about to land
Why yes, Ann ... I do want to hear more about your accident insurance plans.
Yeah buddy, I just got my off of my high horse too!
I just test drove a Bronco. I think I’m gonna go with the Vette.
I'll tell ya, this doesn't throw me as much as the daily news!
No, it's more like parenting a teenager.
I'm flying by the seat of my pants today. How about you?
...and then she said I was easily distracted--what a joke!
Hello, Uber? I wanted Rodeo DRIVE, not RIDE.
Honey, I just called to tell you that I love Obamacare.
Your description 'A little frisky' really nailed it.
It's the landing that concerns me.
So, out-of-state ER visits ARE covered? SWEET!!!
Wait, do you guys have me on speaker?
I found someone else who's not a fan of me driving while I'm on the phone.
Riding a bronc is no different than working for Trump.  One day you're fine and the next day you're calling a headhunter and eating dirt.
You know I can never pass up a deal and the coupon was for a Buck Off.
I'm hanging up now, im getting charged a buck per minute!
I’ll have to call you back, the buck stops here!
Hey Siri, schedule an appointment with my chiropractor
I'm going to have to put you on speaker.
Got to hang up, my ride's over.
If this is your first rodeo press the ‘#’ key now
Honey, I'm on speaker. Tell your horse you were just kidding!
I'm about to stick the dismount.
Yippee!  I'm a stable genius!
This feels like a full 360...I thought you said you were a quarter horse.
I'm about to stick the landing.
Collusion, confusion -- collision, contusion!
So then I whispered:  " Let's see what you really got, you miserable  excuse of a sway-backed loser. Go ahead .... Make My Day.!!"
Thunderbolt's unable to come to the phone right now - who shall I say called?
Call you back as soon as I land!
Does my healthcare plan cover stupidity?
Yes, I'm calling to check on my disability policy.
Totally nailed the experiences versus possessions thing.
No, I’m not driving my car, so it’s OK for me to be on the cell phone.
How about if I call you back as soon as I land.
. . . Then she starts to tell me I’m too easily distracted by my phone.
9-1-1....What is your emergency?
I'll be landing any minute now.
Alright hold on, I'm gonna face time.
I might have to phone you back.
Doris is my life insurance paid up?
Are you kidding? A buck a minute?!
I keep getting kicked off during calls, I need to switch carriers.
It threw me off when you didn't answer right away."
No worries, I'm getting off right now.
I'll call back when I land.
You mean I'm the hundredth caller?!
It's got the rush of rock climbing and the punishment of CrossFit.
Nothing, what are you up to?
I'm at the office. Where else would I be?
Believe me, hindsight isn't all it's cracked up to be.
You were right.  I should stick with being a desk jockey.
No - I said I'm bucking great!
You might say I’m up in the air at the moment.
It turned out that Alberts' new polo pony from Argentina actually did know how to tango.
Yes, Janet, pencil me in with the chiropractor at around 4 seconds form now.
Are you sure I'm covered for pre-existing conditions?
And there, for one brief moment, Jack understood the plight of mankind.
You could say I'm about to complete my bucket list.
Nothing special really. What about you?
I'll call you back when I land.
Then after all that, HE flips ME off!
You can't do this on a landline!
You'll never guess what happened when I asked for a million bucks.
Yeah? Well, screw you and the horse you rode in on, too!!
I really think we'll hit the ground running on this one.
I know you're talking to another horse; who is she?
Yes, this is, actually, my first rodeo!
Oh, I'm still out chasing the big bucks.
I am telling you! It's just like riding the New York subway except for the fresh air!
Pay the damned health insurance, NOW!
I DID say “YeHah!”
of course, I'm in the moment!
Hello Aetna, Can you tell me what my deductible is?
Dude ranch my ass!
Honey....its Wilbur.  Mr. Ed is responding well to the steroid treatments!
It's Verizon's new plan. Unlimited for 60 bucks a month.
I’ll call you right back. I am just about to land!
Hold a sec while I get a selfie.
Dude! Eight seconds! Perfect sport! Matches my attention span!
Hold on; I think the call is about to drop
You’ll never believe where I am right now!
Perfect timing!  Yes, I would like to change to the earlier chiropractic appointment.
I have a new phone plan -- just one buck per call!
Hold on a sec, that's my chiropractor on the other line.
No I said the BUCKING bronco i hired is out of control ...
Success!!  The Tesla Horse will not let you ride using your iPhone.
Mom, of course I'm not driving!
Then, this is hilarious, the bartender asks, 'Why the long face?'
Let me call you back as soon as I land.
What is it you don't understand about "get off my back?"
Yes, that's it. Now open the file and click the View pulldown menu...
My ringtone drives him wild.
I'm not stupid! I watched a few You-Tube videos first.
Whoa, Stock Market!
Not to worry Mom, stuntmen make great money and have amazing benefits.
I'm just horsin' around. You?
I think I'm entering a dead zone Honey.
I think I misread the dosage!
Pre-existing condition? No, but can you rush that policy through?
I might lose you.
Nope, no pre-existing condition at this time.
I haven't had this much fun with a Bronco since the OJ Simpson chase!
Gotta go. Off to Urgent Care.
I just test drove the new mustang. It's bucking awesome!
I feel like a moderate democrat.
No...I said bucked.
Breaking news...
Lunch?  Meet me in the ER in an hour.
Hello Amazon?I need a mattress delivered ...now.
I’m on my flip phone!
And then he told me to ‘Get off your high horse’, so I did!
No, silly. I said I got bucked!
Text me the contact info on that chiropractor you've been bragging about.
Trust me, I got this. This ain't my first cliché.
Actually, I  was hoping that I had butt-dialed the Emergency Room!
Oh sorry dude, I just buck dialed you.
... and I get unlimited calls for a buck!
I'll call again after I land.
George, something's come up. I'll text you from ER.
I might be late. I couldn't pass up a chance for a quick buck.
Tell the boss I won't be in today, I have a touch of bronchitis!
I wanted to be Roy Rogers not Buck Rogers!
Distracted Riding
They cancelled who's health insurance?
I'll call you back after I've landed.
How would you rate your trip with Kevin?
Send in the clowns !
Yeah, I need an ambulance please.
My next horse will have Bluetooth.
Coincidentally, I 'm working on the Fall campaign as we speak.
I've got to go now,  I have a date with gravity.
There must have been a misunderstanding. I ordered a mustang.
Oh,nothing much, just horsing around.
Actually, I would like to switch carriers.
In retrospect, a hands-free device here would have been safer.
Gotta go, sweetie. I'm almost on the ground.
Yeehaw! That did it! I got a signal!
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
What a HOOT! I just tried 'rattlesnake' and he actually knows what it means!
Mom, I’m kinda busy. 
Can I call you back later?
Same old, same old. You?
I said I am out ON the range. I can hear you fine.
Okay, now the reception's perfect. Hold it right there!
Dinner plans? Well, right now I'm up in the air.
Everything's up in the air right now - can I let you know when I land?
No, sweetie. Bucking! I said bucking!
How about the ER?  Does the ER work for you?
Wait'll you see THIS selfie!
This guy thinks he's going to take ME for a ride??
No, no, no. I’m totally free right now.
Sorry, but I have to get off now.
My medical insurance has been restored?"......Yeeeeeeha!!
I could be in a dead zone, soon....
..and then he was like, "get off!
Gotta switch to Airplane mode, I'll call you when I land."
I don't think I can hold any longer.
Dude, can you hear me now?
Hold on, let me get a pen...
Hit the ground running...totally in agreement.
Oh, just horsing around.  What are you doing?
Riding a horse? Fake news
You were right.  It's just like riding a bike.
I've got to change that hissing snake ringtone.
Helmet schmelmet!!
Hold on, I gotta take a fall.
Get this: it's an app that lets you fall off a horse.
Everything's great! I'm finding common ground with rural voters!
Things are kinda up in the airright now for me...
Yeah.  I'm in the air…about to land.  You can pick me up at baggage.
Let me call you back after I've landed.
Best hiccup cure ever!
And it said: free riding lessons. So I said...
It's different, Harry, but it sure beats the A train!
Yes,clearly,this IS my first rodeo!
Honey, I’m gonna be a little late!
Hi Mom. You’ll never guess what I’m doing!
Is this a good time to talk?
Hi! I'd like to make an appointment to see the orthopedist please.
I might lose you for a second here.
Ha! No, I can't hold on.
Exhibit 45: American pretends everything's okay.
I'm going to have to change carriers---I keep getting dropped.
Need to hang up; about to land.
Sorry, Mr. Ed, she can't talk right now.
I should've looked him in the mouth.
Siri—help!
Can you deliver the food to the X-ray department at the hospital?
Hold on, there’s something big and grassy rushing toward my face.
I am flipping, but I have immunity.
The interview process for a job at the White House is even crazier than I thought
After three hours on incessant babble, the horse had had enough.
Seriously, no worries. I'm in complete control of the situation.
Well, I can tell ya, it's the last time I make a Mr. Ed comparison!
Ride comes before the fall.
I can't tell you how head over heels crazy I am about this horse
The next step of the interview process is WHAT??
Because I can't talk on the cellphone while driving a car.
Why yes, please tell me more about your products and services
I just wish the country would do to him what Snappy is doing to me right now.
Hey, Mom, guess what I'm doing?
Harness? I thought you said tug on his hard ass. Ha, ha, no wonder…
I can't give you a decision, I'm just up in the air right now.
Sell! Sell! Selllll!
I'm just leaving now.
Looks like I won’t ride into the sunset after all
This is nothing. Wait until we flip the Congress in November!
I'm still up in the air about that.
Yeah, hang on.  I think I'm about to get dropped by my carrier.
I merely mentioned the jackass in the White House
Gotta go.  I'm about to touch down.
He told me, "The buck stops here,"  but I have evidence to the contrary.
Hello, OnStar...
I’m think I’m about to break up.”
It was at this moment Fred realised he forgot his helmet
Got to go dear, they seem serious about their “No Cell Phone Use While Riding”  policy.
Hang on a sec, I think I'm entering a dead zone.
Hello, emergency room? Do you take reservations?
Wait, wait don’t tell me!
Yes honey, I took my jacket off this time.
...because it said it was  a few bucks less, that's why!
I never knew living in a failing, pseudo-Democracy could be this much fun!
I’m on 3% right now so call me at the hospital!
The theme of this year's retreat is insurance.
Siri, how do you say "stop" in cowboy?
Thank you for calling Customer Service, how may I assist you today?
Gotta go. My eight seconds are up.
Listen, not my first rodeo, pal -- but gonna have to call you back.
Yes, I am keeping one arm in the air.
Why yes, this is perfect time to talk about blood donation!
This is gonna look great on my profile page.
As a hopeless optimist I'll say half my ribs won't be broken.
Oh. You meant STOP horsing around.
It's the roaming charges that really hurt.
I'm using my roll-over minutes right now!
I'll have to call you back
I finished my bucket list!
Can I call you back?  We're going to land now.
No, you hang up.
Hey Hun, the disability insurance kicked in today!
Give me a second, I'm just about to land.
Hi, I’ll be updating my status in 1.5 seconds.
Yeah, I was wondering if my old job was still available.
Midlife crisis? What makes you think that?
I'm on my way down.
Lemme call you back from the hospital,
Ok?
Hey I just getting back to you on the disability insurance....I think I will buy it.
Why yes, I am interested in a health insurance policy.
I’ll have to call you back.  I need to jump off right now.
911? I'll need an ambulance in about 2 feet.
Hello? St. John's Hospital? I'd like a reservation please.
I'm about to find out whether a bad day out here really does beat a good day at the office!
I'll have to get back to you on that, things are still up in the air.
I thought I bought a Mustang, but no, I got a Bronco instead
Sorry, Dad, but this is one horse I'm not getting right back on.
Can I call you back? I'm in the middle of a mid-life crisis.
Please hold... for eight seconds.
Hon, I'm still at the corporate retreat. We're learning about white male privilege.
I'm now for universal healthcare.
And get this -- I don't even know who's horse this is!
I thought the job description said DESK jockey.
The interview is going great!
. . . and some new underwear."
Betsy DeVos' Yacht crashed? That just made my day!
Haha...no! It's the truth! I did fall off my ass!
Get back on again my ass!
You misheard me!  I'll be late because I'm on a bucking bronc, not in the "f...ing Bronx."
My news media job sent me here for training.
What a way to end a bucket list.
No, I’m sorry, I can’t hold on any longer
. . . but the Russian judge will probably only give it a six
Hay hun, I was bumped earlier but I’m over filly now but should be landing soon. Love you!
Yeah, I've got a second.
I'll phone you back when I land.
I'm leaving Wall Street. The real thing is better.
I got a Groupon
He hates this tie you got me!
Just wait for the photoshopped version!
I'm a very stable genius!
You were right! The Mustang is safer than the Tesla!
Then the bartender says, 'hey, buddy, why the long face?', and th—
According to the most recent Gallup Poll, Americans spend too much time on their cellphones.
I thought I was on hold
I guess it’s “over and out”
No, I'm having much more fun than when I was in finance.
Yes of course I am an optimist boss, but introducing our ride sharing service to this market is going to take some work.
I have exactly three seconds.
|I SAID, YEEEEE HAAAAA!!!!!
Hey, did you get my selfie?
I completed my bucket list!
Now I understand the phrase ... "Never text and ride!"
Oops, I saddle dialed you.
Sure, I can hold.  I've got about 8 seconds.
Sorry, I can't hang on any longer.
Ha, ha. You're right. Even my horse thinks I'm a dick.
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.  You do not look like a mule.
Yes, boss, when I say I'm on top of it, trust me, I'm on top of it.
No dear, don't be silly. I'm not talking while I drive, that's dangerous.
Honey, I have great news : I think I'm finally getting off my high horse !
No, It's ok, I'm not driving.
Comedians Riding Horses Eating Dirt
I'm just about ready to break my arm. Can I call you back?
It's all Uber had!!!
Smoother test drive on the Mustang.
...and then I sez, 'does this tickle?'
No, ha ha,  I said I was about to get Bucked!
I won't need that flight after all. I got an earlier one.
Is this 911?
I would like to make an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon
I finally have reception, please be quick.
Let me call you back once I’m in traction!
Honey......do you think you can still find that old neck brace?
Siri, this is not the right Rodeo Drive...
I keep having this same dream of being rejected.
I think that it may be too late to get back into the saddle.
No, that's just it--I can't hold on a sec.
No, I'd still rather do this instead of visiting your mother.
Yeah, sure. I'll hold.
Trust me, everything was consensual until the saddle was added
After quitting his job, Peter quickly found a new way to make a buck
Go ahead and talk, I am off the horse now.
Hey, want to catch a movie? I’m getting off early.
Guess where I'm calling from!
Yeah, the White House staff training is going great!
Seems like you called at a really awkward time.
Hello Blue Cross ? What's my deductible ?
I'll be late. Having a little trouble with my ride.
Not much. You?
I'll be down in a sec.
I'll be landing in a few minutes.
Hang on, I might lose you for a minute.
Yes honey, I have water and I put on my sunscreen.
Hey, you'll never guess what I'm doing now!
Sorry! I must have buck dialed you.
Of course I’m calling hands free.
Not much. What are you up to?
That's why I am calling. I can't hold my horses. I need help now
Hello, I’d like to enroll in your best health insurance plan.
Ha! Ha! If I die, I'll stop having to hear the Trump updates.
You were right, Jeff, I did need a good kick to get off my high horse!
Call it, head's or tail's.
Siri, what’s the best way to land when thrown from a bucking bronco?
I'm coming right down.
Sorry, that was another butt call!
Can’t talk right now ... I’m test driving a Mustang.
Hold on a sec Murray, my horse gets pissed if I don't use the hands-free.
Yes, please put me on hold!  Please!
Hi honey - you were right!
Meet me at the ER!
Say again, I’m breaking up
Siri - Google how to land from a bucking bronco.
Honey, can you up the life insurance?  This corporate retreat is no joke.
Hang on a sec, I’m being involuntarily bumped.
I'm about to lose service.  Let me call you back from the hospital.
Mom! I've never felt so free!
This is so much better than project management!
Whatta ya mean, "Hang on a minute"
Oh, you meant I should test drive the FORD Mustang...
Actually, I do mind holding.
Hey Donald, I flipped."
Heads or Tails?
I'm in the air about this. Can I call you back, tomorrow?
Hold on, Fred. Things are a bit up in the air right now.
Apparently, the horse had a "no cell phone" policy!
Technically, I’m not driving.
Thanks, Darrell. The dude ranch app is remarkably realistic!
Sorry.  Butt call.
Hold on--I gotta take this fall.
Ha. No way would I consider coming back to work at Trump White House. This new job is easier.
Yeah, it's a bull market but the ride's almost over.
Of course I would never drive while talking on the phone.
I would like to file a claim
Great training for my next job in the White House
It's great, I feel like a million bucks already!
I don’t think we are at the same Crazy Horse.
Oh, don't worry, honey. I am just horsing around!
Okay, I'll keep my ear to the ground.
Hello, Hertz? That Mustang you gave me just isn't working out.
Hey I'm going to let you go; I've got to get off.
These flip-phones are great when you're mobile.
Forget bulls and bears — I've got a new metaphor for this crazy market!
I did it! I passed the buck!
No,
I don't know how the reins got behind the horse or why they aren't attached to the bridle
Yeah, I’m just on my way to the hospital.
I TOLD you twice - Get off my back!!
Yes dear.  I’ll DEFINITELY cross this off my bucket list.
Hold your horses is just an expression, Harvey.
You'll never guess where I am.
Did we catch you at a good time?
I’m still bucking for promotion.
It’s just as safe as calling you while driving!
Just give me 3.7 seconds of your time.
I'll call you back - I'm about to go viral.
I know, I know..., I love Groupon too!
If we get cut off it’s probably because I’m dead!
Yes, I can hold on, but just for a few seconds.
Uber reveals its New York City 
driver cap workaround. 
Note, ride cancelling penalties apply.
Yes, I would like to trade in my mustang.
He takes the gold if he can nail this landing!
I’m falling and I won’t get up.
Yep! I still have a flip phone!
My therapist says I need to take risks and be more spontaneous!
Whoops, my bad! I thought you said "Go Buck Yourself"...
No, I'm not talking and driving.
That's better,now I can hear you.
Don't worry, Mom, this isn't my first rodeo.
I'd like to close the deal on that insurance we talked about
I noticed hands-free gives me more air time
And I said, 'I don't need no stinkin' helmet'
Yea, I'd like to report one of your Uber drivers. First of all, he didn't even have a car...
Why yes, I am interested in learning more about my health insurance options!
Hon....WHOA...my last spur of the moment!
Hello. I'd like to apply for Obamacare.
No! You're not interrupting me at all!  I'm doing absolutely nothing!
Funny you should ask. I'm in the 5th stage just now. Acceptance.
All I said was, 'OK Dude, show me what you got.'
Great news honey, I'm about to hit the worker's comp jackpot.
You say I'm breaking up??
You'll have to hold on - I have fall waiting!
Hi, I'd like to choose my primary physician.
Why yes, its been a volatile ride.  You might want to shift some of your assets to maintain a better balance.
It’s been rough, but I have a feeling I’ll land on my feet.
This really is great practice for being Chief of Staff!
Bellevue?  I'd like to reserve a room.
It’s a little late to tell me to hold my horses.
Wrong time to say, Whoa!
I'm test driving a mustang! Not great for work but a lot of fun!
Yo, dude, it's a dude ranch, what could happen?
And then she was like, WHOA!
These team-building outings just get better every year!
Getting bucked off, might lose you
I had switched to a standing desk, but then I thought I could do even better.
Just tell him the buck stops here!
Gotta go, I'll text you when I land.
Obviously, this is my first rodeo.
Doc, that Bronco dilator you told me to use is really helping my asthma, but it’s playing hell with my arthritis.
Believe me I’m off my high horse and pretty well grounded!
No, Bob, I said I have a"bucking" problem.
Sure it's been a rough ride and I'm about to hit the ground hard, but heck for once that aint no metaphor and that's why I'm smiling.
Good Lord! Somehow I must have butt-dialed you!
Manhattan? No, I’m not in Manhattan. Don’t you remember? I told you at breakfast that I was going to the broncs this afternoon.
No worries – my current long-distance plan is just a buck a call.
Hang on, I think I'm about to drop the call.
But boss, I'm really going to the hospital this time.
Sure, I can talk.
Concierge? Do you have any immediate massage openings?
Oh, I thought you said I should go buck myself.
Hold on, I better switch you to hands-free.
Hang on, I'll call you from the E. R.
Such a relief to have some time off from my White House job!
I'll call ya when I get a break!
Hold on, I forgot to put you on rodeo mode.
Honey, the signal is much better now.
No, no, nothing serious, what are you up to?
Just calling to say it's over, Ellen. But it's been a helluva ride!
No, I can talk...
It feels a lot like my last marriage
Oh, you know, same old same old, just horsing around.
And do you take Anthem Blue Cross?
This is the fun part. Hitting the ground, not so much.
For horse-riding lessons, press 1...
Hold on, my service provider just kicked me off again.
Hold on a sec. I’m gonna try and send you  one epic selfie!
Sounds good.  Well, gotta bounce, bro.
In a moment we’re going to have a dropped call. I’ll call you back from the ambulance.
I get it! I get it! “The buck stops here”!
Hold on, I'm about to enter a dead zone.
I am so over goat yoga.
This is still a better experience than my time with the Trump administration.
This completes my bucket list
Hold on I have to instagram something.
Best.  Lunch.  Hour.  Ever!
It's proving to be an over the top experience as promised in the brochure!
Well, at least I finally completed my bucket list.
Does this mean the ride is over?
Hold on, I’m losing my connection!
I've gotta sign off now. This call has already cost me a buck.
Yes yes that's correct "The buck stops here"
Funny you should ask.
Finally!  The first time I've gotten good reception this whole vacation.
Yes, I can take your 15 minute survey!
I'm sorry if saying Id like to mount you caused  offense.
I'm doing good, mom.  Just a few ups and downs, you know
Ha! Let me know when you have a serious offer. This ain’t my first rodeo.
I’m up in the air on it right now. Let me get back to you.
Now this is what you call horsing around!
You were right, honey! I did need to get out of my comfort zone.
Hi honey,can you call our insurance company and see if they cover stupid.
Oh, I'm absolutely hands free right now.
I'll be on the ground soon
Fine.  Next time I'll take Uber!
You won't believe the new app I got for only a buck!
I’ll let you go. I have to take this fall.
Very possible my reception might cut out in a sec here...
I thought you said you don't buck on the first date ...
He's extremely ticklish!
DON'T WORRY HONEY, I'M HANDS FREE.
I assumed Uber meant the car is a Bronco, not the driver!
No, I really do have to go.
That was no USB port under his tail!
Hold on, I'll take a selfie.
But the horse I rode in on isn't in the mood right now.
Can I call you back later, Mom?
I promise you, I'm not driving my car right now.
Yes, boss. I'm afraid this is my first rodeo.
Honey, we still on Obama Care?
Yes, I'd like to change that pizza delivery address to the Urgent Care Clinic.
Hey Babe - remember last night when you said I couldn't last 10 seconds doing bucking bronco...........
No, no, not a bad time at all!
No, no boss, I said bucked off!
Looks like the buck didn't stop here this time.
Nooo, not on hold
Bob, I'm going to have to call you back.  It actually is my first rodeo.
I am going to have to let you go, we are about to prepare for landing.
Same old, same old, and you??
YES I love it! I'm quite literally head over heels.
Well it's not my first ro....Oh I guess it is.
NO, NO, NO . I said  I'm on a " Bucking"  Bronco.
Siri.....activate Aflac equine option!
No! I said I was "bucked off"!
I'm putting you on speaker.  I've got to video this.
‘Go ahead. I’m no longer on hold.’
Hey, I may start to break up.
Oh, just horsing around, how about you ?
Holy Mackerel, all I said was 'I like Trump'.
Yeah, the results of the Gallop poll are very promising.
It was this or spending the weekend with my mother-in-law.
Is the Jake? From State Farm?
Hello, Jackie Chan Horse Training Center, can you please hold for a moment?
No I didn’t sign the dude ranch disclaimer.  You’ll take the case?
We’re like the Flying Wallendas, except with a horse and a tax attorney.
Can I call you back?
My connection's unstable.
Yes Elon. The self driving Mustang. Some emission, small footprint.
Did you see that selfie? Me, masterfully astride a HUGE horse!
The ride up here was rough, but now I’ve got a good signal
All this horse-trading gets a little exciting at times, Bob!
I swear, Dave. It's even better than those juice cleanses Susan won't stop talking about!
Hold on. Let me get this selfie!
Yeah, I just got the hands free option.
The White House Director of Communications job is going great!
Let me know when you can clearly see both of our faces together in the frame.
Hey...just a second...my Uber is dropping me off.
I’ll be down in a second!
Yeah, the dude ranch is a total de-stressor.  I haven't thought about Trump all morning.
I love this part...
Another day working in the White House
I can’t talk now. I’m flying.
I head over heels about this ranch trip.
Shaken, not stirred
yes--a flip phone
Lunch?  Well, at the moment it looks like I'll be in the hospital for a few days -- how about sometime next week?
Sorry it's a little loud. I'm working on my work-life balance.
Amazon, one bottle of aspirin, please
Mom, remember that pony I wanted as a kid?"
And then the horse says, "I've fallen and I can't giddyup"
That's what happens when you text and ride.
Gotta go.  I'll be landing soon.
Something just came up---let me get back to you.
Well, it looks like my flight is about to land.
Well I WAS calling to say 'I'm back in the saddle'.
Well yes, I actually am interested in switching my cable service provider
That's right, kids, I taught our horse how to dab.
My deductible is how much?
I can't hear you, I'm breaking up.
Bill these Tinder dates just keep getting weirder
No, no, 'Broncs' not 'Bronx'
I said it RHYMES WITH buck me!!!
OK, I will be down in a minute
Not breaking up, just about to break my neck!
Me, I'm in the air about to land.  How about you?
Hi Mom!  Are you watching channel twelve?
This is ironic Sweety, but the buck actually does start here.
Same ol, same ol. What's new with you?
Sorry, but that really threw me.
Just horsing around
Oh, and can you text me a good orthopedist?
Of course I’m bucking the trend; I’ve just got to land on my feet!
Call you back when I land.
You know that idea I had about riding a horse...
They call it 'the equine paso doble!'
Political stunt? Not if it gets us the rodeo demographic, it isn't!
Hold on, let me take a selfie first.
It's for you.
Got it! If I live, this goes viral!
Honestly, I think I have found something just as exciting as the rough and tumble world of arbitrage!
This WAS my first rodeo.
I'll text you as soon as I land
Can I call you back from the hospital?
Great news honey! Remember that promotion I was bucking for...
Oh I just got thrown by a bronco and about to break my neck, but I can talk, sure!
Hey, Ma.  Yea, I'm fine.  Could I call you back?
I will be landing momentarily.  You can pick me up at ground level.
Oh - not much.  How about you?
Not much. Just horsin' around.
Hi sweetie. No, daddy's not busy at all.
Yeah... the views out West are breathtaking!
All right, all right,, I'll  stop introducing you as "My Little Pony!"
Quick Mom, turn on Sports Channel
Siri, real quick question about horseback riding.
That's right — and the horse you rode in on!
I haven't had this much fun since I worked in the White House!
"Hello, Uber? I'd like to file a complaint about the driver you sent me.
Did you say I'm breaking up?
I’m calling because it’s too hard to text at this time
Call you back; my ride is leaving.
Yippee-ki-yay yourself. You had me neutered.
Too much horsepower!
Ohhh! Rodeo DRIVE! I thought you said -
Thank you for calling bronco customer service.  Your projected hold time is less than 8 seconds
911, yes this is an emergency!
Tell everyone - I’ve finally found a substitute for all that cocaine!
I think I may need to change my ringtone.
I'll be on the ground in a second.
Well, I certainly feel thrown, to say the least.
I'll call you back at the end of my break.
No, not gonna be really busy for another 2-3 seconds. Why?
I clearly misunderstood the buck-a-call concept.
Actually, I’m just about to take a break ...
I couldn't resist. It's only a buck a call!
No honey, nobody else is here. Seriously, I'm just horsing around!
I stayed longer on the horse than I did at my last job!
Yup. WAY harder than the bull at the pub.
OK, I gotta go!
Hello, you've reached my mane line.
Hello?  Uber customer service?
I can't believe he would laugh about beating a dead horse!
Check out this video I'm about to post of me breaking my neck!
He's the one making the big bucks around here.
Just a minute.  I think I just left my comfort zone.
It’s just a horse, how hard can it beeeee!
No, silly, I am not sitting on the toilet.
What do you mean I can't bring him on the plane? He's my Emotional Support Bronco.
Hi, just checking if there's any way to lower my deductible and no I can't hold.
Don’t worry, I never text while riding.
911 whats your emergency
So much for multitasking...
It was then I realized the benefit of a hands free phone.
I'm falling off my horse; what's up with you?
Hey, Bob! I just saved 10% on my horse insurance!
I’ll be landing shortly. Meet me at the hospital in about an hour.
Ringtone Cowboy
I'm just breaking in a new phone
I said "ride to Philly," not "to ride a filly"!
Hi honey, can you check to see if our accident policy covers wrangling while intoxicated?
I’m about to lose coverage.
I know, but it's the last day for my Groupon.
Cell service is good, but I may break up.
Can I change my answer to "truth"?!
We are SO going to win Dancing with the Horses.
Best Groupon ever! And I still have seven seconds left!
Just trying to buck the white collar worker stereotype
I'm test driving a new mustang...  it's just a mid-life crisis thing... Gotta hang up.
It's not as smooth a ride as my old Mustang.
I can't give you a firm answer - things over here are really up in the air right now.
Hold on, I'm getting kicked off the network.
I am being bucked off...I'm at  a therapy dude ranch  for cellphone addicts.
This isn't quite what I meant by 'a fast buck'...
Let me tell you, there is nothing like connecting with nature...
Let me bounce this off you
The President said what?!
Don't worry, this isn't my first rodeo.
Whoa, gotta go! My minutes are up!
No, no!  I said "Hold on, I'm getting BUCKED hard!"
'Hallo, IT support? How do I exit this game?'
Oooooh, I thought you said to go BUCK myself.
At the dude ranch, you totally forget all your other problems!
Nah, just your usual ups and downs...
Some kind of team building event.
Bucking the odds, I'd say I'll be late for dinner."
No,boss. I'm right here in the office,trying to stay on top of,uh ... things.
I get no kick from champagne...
My new VR desk is legit.
The commute is rough but I do love working outdoors.
No sweetheart, I don't think Santa is giving you a Pony this year...
Hold on, you'll get a kick out of this.
They said it would never work, but the epileptic stallion and the masochist cowboy lived happily ever after.
Of course I’m happy I left the White House.
The Oft-forgotten Modernist Dressage
On my way, sir! I'm flying over Wyoming right now.
I said, "Don't touch me there!"
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna get back on the horse.
Relax, will you? It’s only illegal to talk on your cell phone if you’re driving a CAR!
Please continue to hold. Your call will be answered in the order received.
Hold on, I'm Breaking up.
I'll be off in a second
I've got the horse right here. . .
Call you back. I’m about to lose my signal...
I've just been unfriended.
Well it's definitely an improvement over the bull, Terry
Mom, I’m a little busy right now.
I can’t commit to anything - I’m up in the air at the moment.
There are worse ways to make a buck.
I'm going to Airplane Mode now. Love you!
Sure, the commute is longer, 
but you can't beat the rents out here!"
No worries. It will be obsolete before I hit the ground.
And so I go, ‘Hold your horses!’
Ha ha!  No, I'm just horsin' around.
Janet, I think you may have been right after all about the advantages of bluetooth earphone.
And I got fired by the president all in the same​ day, what are the odds?
I was on hold...
Well, NOW it's a flip phone.
No, everything is good dear. Why do you ask?
So far, this feels EXACTLY like the virtual reality version!
Not much. Just out for a ride. What are you up to?
In fairness, the Craigslist ad did say I could have him for one buck.
I knew he was a horse trader, but I thought I was getting a Ford Bronco.
I’m using a flip phone, so service is a little shaky
Hang on a second, I'm dismounting to take your call.
Not doing much, just horsing around.
Gambling with other people's savings just wasn't exposing me to enough personal risk.
No, don't put me on hold!
Hi! All good. Things just up in the air!
Reins?
Mind if I put you on speaker?
Darling, i'm having a lovely time, but if we' d get cut off would you mind calling an ambulance?
I've decided on the Mustang — it has more kick.
Hold on while I take a selfie.
He just bucked me off! This is so much more fun than virtual reality! Yes, I'll call you from the emergency room!
Yes, he can talk. He just said, "Get on, I'll give you a ride to remember."
Hold on, I’m getting another call.
I cant text while I'm riding!
Hold on, let me put on speakerphone.
Just tryin’ to make a buck. How ‘bout you?
No, I never text and ride...
Can I call you back? I took an inexpensive alternative to Uber and my driver and I just got into an argument.
Hold on, I'm about to hit a dead zone.
Meet me at the gate.  I'm about to land.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to take this!
You didn't hear me correctly, I said I ve just been bucked!
Hi honey. Buy some insurance.
I'll betcha can't guess where I am right now
I'll call you back.  We're losing our connection.
Are you buckin' kiddin' me!
I've never felt more alive!
And…there will be no more talk about gelding.
Wait'll you see the selfie I took!
This is SO much better than the corporate life!
My wife also throws a fit when I talk on my cell when she is in the room.
Ok, now one more time for my Snapchat!
Can you hold
This isn't what I meant by 'add a contract rider'...
Herb, let me call you right back. I am just about to land.
Sorry, my call might get dropped!
Call me back.  I am going to be out for awhile.
Guess what... I took your advice about moving to the broncs to get into freelance riding.
Absolutely, Marge. I'll be off in just a second.
I need a horse whisper ASAP
I tend to ignore my problems until they hit me in the face.
Don't worry I am not driving.
I should have just called an Uber.
Hello, Manulife? I like to change my deductible please.
Yeah, it's called the 'Cowboy Experience,' I found a coupon online!
You've caught me at a bad time, Margaret.
Hey,  gotta go. Widow Maker, here, has got a bug up her you know what.
Hey, I may lose you in a bit"
I don’t think I’m going to be in work tomorrow.
Hi honey. I’m on the hor....  Scratch that; I’m OFF the horse.
I need a ride home.
Ha ha. That's amazing. You always make my life seem so boring.
Can you hold a second I've got to take this fall?
Let me call you back, I've just been bumped from my trip home.
Yeah, um...can I call you back in a couple of minutes?
No, I’ve got time to talk.
What comes after, "Yippee ki yay?"
I'll show you how to make a buck!
Sorry!  It must have been a butt call.
Honey this will be the perfect place to send your mother!
No, goat yoga is so yesterday. Trust me. Horses! Horses!
Five  seconds better than last year.
Oh, no honey, it’s just Jake, from State Farm
I just took a great selfie riding with no hands
I don't know. I can think of worse ways to make a buck.
I’ll be there as soon as I can. Something came up.
And this is my first dismount!
Not much, just horsing around. How about you?
Yeah! Unlimited data. And it only cost me a few bucks!
Honey, there's a good chance I won't be home for supper tonight or any night.
Woo hoo, 5G!
Never text and ride
It’s a dynamic work environment!
Siri!  Call an ambulance!
Never a horse that couldn't be rode, never a suit that couldn't be throwed
Howdy! My plans are a bit up in the air, but I have a few secs to chat...
Siri, where is the nearest rodeo clown?
Hold on...I have to take a selfie!
And then I was, like, 'whoah!'
And a few kickbacks never hurt, either!"
On second thought, cancel the turkey on whole wheat with sprouts to-go and send an ambulance
Dr. Doe? Yes, I'm calling to see if you have an opening for an appointment on Monday. You do? Great!
Playful rascal, ain't ya?
Hey, I'll call you back after I land.
Sorry but I can't talk right now.  I just took off.
whoa, hold on.  I've got to take this fall.
I'm finally living my best life.
A buck a minute, no way!
Can I call you back? Something's just thrown me.
Hey, cowboy, you do what you want, but I ain't jumping' that fence for a lousy bunch of hay.
As a matter of fact, this IS my first rodeo.
Me?  Nothing, just horsing around.
Mrs. Jones, I understand you feel the market's been volatile, but volatility is all relative.
I'm thinking about going into glue.
'I shouldn't have Call to the Post as my ringtone.'
Honey, can I call you right back? I'm in the middle of something.
How did "City Slickers 2" end?
I'll give you another update when I land.
Hi Mom, no, no, now’s a good time.
Could I put you on hold? I have another fall coming..."
It’s like virtual reality but there’s more of a kick.
No, boss! I said bucked offffffff!
I'm telling you, Lennie, the public is tired of Dancing with the Stars.  Dancing with Horses is the next big thing.
I thought you said there was an App for this.
I may lose you in a moment.
I might be late.
Just a tad bumpier than a Manhattan cab ride.
Why am I in Wyoming?
Of course I’m not texting!
I'm using my rollover minutes.
Feels like a million bucks!
So then she said, 'you'll never last 8 seconds.' And I was like, "I'll show you!"
Nothing that can't wait...
Hello ? Dressage hotline ?
Hang on, Jeff. This could be the horse people calling back now.
Anthony Scaramucci finds a career he can hold onto "long term"
About to land. I'll call you when we're at the gate.
It’s gonna hurt for a while, but I have a great selfie.
I know, the caption contest hasn't been fun for years.
Hi, I’d like to add “Horse Accident” to my insurance plan – effective immediately.
I'm sorry, honey, but Daddy's a little busy right now.
Hang on, I'm getting another call.
You get the same cathartic beat down without the unstable cult leader with multiple personalities!
I'm switching to airplane mode for safety."
Dad! My internship's going great!
Nah, I'm not busy.
Still better than the office
Huh, ...he must think I said, buck-off"
Noooo, I'm not texting while riding!
Ok pal,here’s were you get off. Have a nice day.
I'm running late and I'll need wheelchair access.
I'm flying through the air with the greatest of ease!
Yea, I'm having a rough day!
Well, I got worse news a half a second ago
So next Wednesday works for you?
Yeah, almost home, honey
Press record! Press record!
Good one, Thunder, but wait till I get my spurs on!
I’m flying right now; I’ll call you back when we land.
I'll call you back the moment I regain consciousness.
You can lead a horse to water but he really doesn’t like business talk.
Busy?...No, just horsin around. Whatsup?
How fast can you deliver a riding helmet?
Gotta go - need to switch to Airplane Mode.
There's a chance the call may be dropped.
Yeah, it’s this new cell phone plan—only a buck a day.
including the hula hoop was my big mistake
Can I open my eyes now?
This is so much better than being a desk jockey.
Hold on let me grab my pen
It's still much safer than cars
He said I could ride him for a buck.
Yeah, honey, the team building day is going great.
I'm not horsing around. Things are really up in the air right now.
I love you too Babe!
Boy, am I getting a bang for my buck!
This merger's been a damn rodeo."
Please put me back on hold.
Hahahahaha! I can't believe you're still on a flip phone!
I said the word IS instead of ISN'T. The sentence should have been, “This ISN'T my first rodeo."
Hey, do you mind if I put you on hold for just a sec?
I really thought a bucking bronco was some kind of SUV!
Buck me? Ha-Ha-Ha! No! Ha-Ha-Ha! Buck you! Right! And the...Ha-Ha-Ha...the horse...Ha-Ha-Ha...you rode in on!
On second thought, I will take that double indemnity package.
Sure...  I'm head over heels about you, baby!
You'll never believe what I'm doing right now.
Sure, I've got time to talk about better health insurance.
I'm posting the picture on Facebook right now!
Burt, you just gotta try this new trust-building exercise!"
I'm trying out my new this-is-gonna-smartphone.
My new career as horse whisperer is off to a flying start.
No, I said I'm "bucked"
Nothing much. What’s new with you?
It’s like the Trump Whitehouse.
Help! I'm about to fall and won't be able to giddyup!
Hey, this is my stop; I'll need to call you back.
Oh, so THAT'S what you meant by hands-free!
Hey Siri, Google 'affordable chiropractors.'
Maybe you were right about distracted rodeo riding.
Whoa!!  Really?
Todd unknowingly stepped out of the stock art photo and into some biting social commentary about the state of our democracy.
Yeah, but the first 8 seconds are free.
Can you hold? I've got to take another fall.
One rodeo clown, please.
Yes, I went back to the old flip phone!
So much for this bucket list.
Yeah, the reception here is not good either.
I'll text you when I land at the gate.
Did you say "stirrups?"
It looks like I won’t be getting back to you on that.
I have no clue why they call this dude ranch, "Broke Back Mountain."
I promise you honey, I’m not horsing around again!
It may be my last Selfie, but it will be a great Selfie!
Ha! - You should see me when I'm off my meds.
You know how you keep telling me not to drive and use my cell phone?  I think I can add another place I shouldn't.
And for a few extra bucks, I get ten free apps.
Believe it or not, Rachel, I’m having a bucking good time.
Yes, I would like to take a brief survey.
That's great!  Hey, my phone is about to die...
Well there's being thrown and then there's being thrown for a loop and right now I'm in the latter.
Tell corporate I'm not in the race anymore
Yep - that's the concussion kicking in.
I have to stop texting while droving!
I'll call you back.  I'm going through a pummel.
It's okay, in Wyoming it's legal to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle.
Ha ha, you said "you should take a bus to the Bronx" not "you should take to bustin' Broncs".
Hands free, my ass!
Just a quick Hi and Bye: I'm about to lose consciousness.
Well, let me tell you, this is the last time I’m taking Uber.
Hold for a second.  I have to get this.
...So I said "Horses? They LOVE me."
It’s okay. I’m hands free.
Great news! My insurer says my rates won't go up after one accident.
Wait . . . what sort of "hits" were you talking about?
Do you think I would really tell you, even if this was my first rodeo
No bucked...I'm getting bucked. The deals fine.
I have to say, I'm a little thrown off.
I didn't say dump.  I said jump !
Gotta go!
Hi--what is your return policy?
i got to find a better way to make  a  buck
I won't need any extra minutes this month
Hi, honey. I've got a problem at work, so I'll be late for dinner.
It'll be great to see you!  Just look for me at the ER.
Back at ya! Gotta fly.
This actually is my first rodeo, are they dangerous?
Oh, nothing much.  How about you?
Yep, you're a lot clearer now.
Phil! I'm in Westworld and I still have no idea what's going on.
My health insurance that doesn't cover pre-existing conditions starts when?
I'll do anything for a buck!
Forget tech start ups. This is where the big bucks are.
Is the enrollment period for Obamacare still open?
Enjoying my last moments of full physical mobility.
The things I'll do for a buck!
Bustin a bronc, you?
Hello Blue Cross? How quickly can you bind coverage?
Hi Sid. Please pay the premiums on all of my insurance policies, stat!
hi, can you confirm my medical deductible in the next 2-3 seconds?
It's not how you get bucked off. It's how you land.
Gotta go.  I only get eight seconds per call with my new plan.
Great news! I'll be there right after the hospital stay.
Hold on, I’m going into a tuck-and-roll.
Can...you...hear...me...now?
Yeeee Haw...That was one fine Bar-mitzvah
Back up on the horse, just like you ordered, doc!
I think my agent sent me on the wrong cattle call ...
Mom stop worrying...I'm fine.
You're bouncing me because I didn't follow the dress code??
Whoa, boy, don't take it personal. 'And the horse you rode in on' is just a figure of speech.
Whatever the readers pick, it will likely be stupid and unfunny.
It's lots better than VR, so far.
I think it's time to trade in my mustang for a Mustang!
Hands freeeeeeeeeeeee!
You caught me at a great time, Bill! No screaming kids in the background.
I think it's time I got back in the saddle at the office.
I wasn't texting
Great time to talk. I’ve almost landed.
OK, let me call you back in six months.
Yes--literally really big bucks!
I got an Uber for a buck.
Over and out!
Sounds great, I’ll hit the ground running with that.
A hands free device would be an improvement.
Quick! Cancel my Four O'clock
I couldn't believe Groupon was still a thing, either!
You're loud and clear -- I've finally got three bars.
Wrong number.
Hello Uber, I think there’s been a mistake.
Honey, is our insurance paid up?
He just threw me and I'm going to be in the hospital for some time but it still beats being press secretary for Trump
Wait, I have an incoming close call
It's the only way I can get a signal!
I think my “First Call” bugle horse race ringtone set him off.
I'm right on it, Frau Blucher!
My rider's  I-phone conversation was insolent and he was not properly dressed for riding me. His tie is not a rider's tie.
This has to be the 'Mother' of dropped calls!
I may have overdressed, but so far so good!
Love you too babe. But somebody is getting a little jealous.
Next time, I promise myself to take an Uber!
'We're about to be disconnected.
Hang on Dan, my Uber driver is getting an attitude
An unstable relationship
You can't get kicked off with a 4G signal.
Cowboy? Not furlong.
It’s great here, no one’s on each other’s back.
I'm still up in the air about this Dude Ranch thing.
I'll call you back on a ground line
Hi! Horse can’t come to the phone right now.
The moment Bill clinched the 2018 Darwin Awards.
Hello - I'd like to know how to use my rollover minutes!
Hang up and dial 911 , "Animal Control"
Sorry, I’m kinda I’m the middle of something here
I'll have to call you back, I'm going into a coma.
Hey Siri, how long does it take for a compound fracture to heal?
Sorry I gotta go, we're taking off.
Can you imagine? Me? Not present in the moment?
I've got to bounce. Talk later?
Sorry, something urgent has come up and I will not be able to make our appointment.
On no one's bucket list - free falling, head first while talking on cell phone
What? No, I'm listening to you; I'm not doing anything else right now.
K, boss. Gotta go hit the ground running.
Oh honey! What a trail ride! I'll send you a selfie just as soon as I finish my dismount.
i'm gettin thrown off this bronco and i'm high as fuck on weed food and, sure i'll hold
...Thanks for calling Billy's Bucking Broncos customer service, please hold on while we connect your call...
This is the only way I can get off!
I think I've been disconnected.
Of course it's safe to call from a horse. It's not like I'm driving a caaaaaaar!
And then I said, " What do you mean I can't get rodeo clown insurance?"
Great dance moves...we’re sure to win!
You'd better cancel our dinner reservation .
This is gonna hurt, but at least I'm in a cartoon that can't include a Trump reference!
Break dance lessons with Scout, how about you?
Livin' the life, lovin' the bucks.
Another credit card offer?
You picked a bad time to call me Lucille.
To be perfectly honest, I'm quite happy where I am.
Okay, now I understand why cowboys dress as they do!
Ooooo, I like this new flip phone!
Sorry I can't hold any longer.
And that's how I got the name - Big Text.
Quick honey! Buy the supplemental insurance.
I'll call you back after I land.
Nothing much . Just,you know, horsing around.
Can you hold on for a second while I take another fall?
Seriously, the buck stops with me, right here, right now!!
I'll be landing soon.
Babe, I am so getting me that wild Mustang I've always wanted.
SIRI -- rent me a wheelchair!
I've decided to change carriers.
Hold on a sec, I'm in the throes of a great idea!
Hey, lemme take a quick break and get back to you?
What a great Press Secretary I am going to be.
No, I’m not on my high horse, I’m just bucking around
I really have to hang up now.
Great news, doctor! Glad to hear the test results show no lasting effect from that bowling mishap!
I'd like a quote for Health Insurance, please.
The commute's a little rough.
That'll have to wait til Monday, Peter. Our team is having an offsite.
Yeah, having a real kick-ass time here!
Yes Geico I'll hold
Can I call you back in a couple surgeries?
Giddy DOWN!
You were right: this Uber driver is a real ass.
Ever hear the one about dropped calls?
It was going fine until I tried for a selfie!"
Listen Harry, I’ve got to go. My flight’s already in the air.
I lost the reins, Harold. This deal just threw me for a loop.
She's an absolute joy to ride! And only 800 bucks!
Ed  -  I'm stress-free for the first time since 2008!
Gotta hang up now...we're about to descend.
Don’t be ridiculous, Honey.  Of course I am using the Blue Tooth!
Aw hell! I didn't last this long in the Trump White House!
It's so great to disconnect and experience life!
Sorry, I can't hang on right now.
OK, OK, I'm sorry I called you an "old nag"!
I get such a kick from rodeo ballet!
Gotta go. The horse wants attention.
Found one that will keep our kids away from their gadgets!
Can't talk now, honey. I am roaming.
This wasn’t the mustang I was  wishing for!
Hey, I'll call you back in a minute.
Don't worry dear, I'm not driving.
And you’re positive I’ll receive the full insurance benefit?
Hi Hon, I've just picked up a couple of great positions we can try tonight!
How long will the survey take?
Can you hold on a sec? I need to take this other call.
I haven't had this much fun since my last prostate exam!
Let me call you right back - I'm almost done here.
"Yipeee  ki yay  mo..........."
You try bucking the trend for once.
Maybe I'll see you later. I'll know very soon.
Frankly, I don't give a buck!
Oh! , Hi... Not much... Just horsing around.

I was sure you said “horse right, not horse left.”
Did I tell you that even the dirt tastes better out here?
Let's circle back when I land.

It's a metaphor, literally.
I wish this thing had Bluetooth. I’m dying over here!

I'll get back to you when I land.
Horseback riding really does give you a high.
Hey, this is really my first rodeo.
I’ve got a great idea for this year’s office party!
My other ride's a Jaguar.
At the sadist rodeo...
Would you visit me in the hospital?  I hav a hunch I'll be there within the hour.
That's the last time I ask you for ten bucks.
Hey, can I call you back? I'm about to go through a dead zone.
I'll have to call you on my back.
When you said you were putting me on the Bronco account, I thought you meant Ford!

Let me put you on "whoa!"
I MUST be covered! Its not like I got thrown off this horse intentionally.
Can I put you on mute for a second?

We're about to break up, dear. I'll call you back.
Wild horses couldn't keep me away!
Can I call you back in 8 seconds?
This better be good!
I know you've been seeing other horses, Brad!

Your breaking up with me isn't the only thing throwing me for a loop now!
You're not going to believe this! Let me take a selfie and send it.
Thanks again for recommending this place for R & R after the Trump Whitehouse.
Days like this can be ball busters.
Hey, I really should go--I going to break up soon anyway.
You've reached horse-related-injuries law firm, how may I help you?
Peterson? Is this a good time? Are you sure? Hate to be a bother. Oh, not too bad, Yourself? Glad to hear it; glad to hear it. Oh, nothing much just horsing around. Well, now that you mention it, I think I might like to reconsider that resignation.
You’ll love it.  No traffic!
Honey, I'm throne

Oh, you know....just another day at the office.
He saw I was on my cell phone and, well,  I guess he needs more attention.
We just adopted him! They were very specific about no refunds. I don't know why!
That’s not what I meant by “more horsepower.”
I can totally see it's butt hole!
Sorry. It must have been a butt dial.
I think he likes me!
So then Karen shows up at the party, and Tiffany totally exploded.
Collusions not a crime!?!?!  That's a good one!!
Great news, I just got my own internet meme!
Yes! He broke stride. I win on points.
You wouldn't dare do this to the  Marlboro man.
Yes, honey, I told them to take the job and keep it, I’m finally going to chase my dream job of being a rodeo clown!
You were absolutely right. E-rodeo is an amazing virtual reality application. By the way, does it hurt when you fall to the ground?
Return to work? Sorry boss, but I'm not ready to get back in the saddle
He's through the loop!  Just a sec--we've got to stick the landing.
This horse moves around more than the money I launder.
Bucking the oddballs.
Am I approved to ride the New York Subway yet?

It's gonna hurt but it's nowhere near as bad as doing a performance review."
Trust me, go with the dark horse.
Yes, of course I can multi-task...
Just horsing around. What are you up to?
If this doesn’t impress the East German judge, nothing will.
Damn these “combat Alzheimer’s” adventures!
Are you getting all this??
Now's a great time to talk!   In a second though, call an ambulance.
Don't worry - I've been to this rodeo before.
You wouldn’t believe it. I suggested a live stock buyback and he thought I said a livestock bareback.
Hold on a sec while I break my neck.
I won’t be able to meet you for lunch.
Can you hang on a sec? I spilled my latte.
less stressful...less dangerous,

Tell him I was too bucking busy—or vice versa.
Hold that while I take a selfie.
I'll call you later. I'm about to land.
Hold on a second - I think I'm about to hit a dead spot.
I'll send you a selfie from the hospital.
Hey Dan, sorry I can't make the meeting. 
Working from homestead today.
No, I can't take a selfie.
This horse is letting me fly freeeeeeee!!!!
Can I call you back? I'm about to be out of range.
I might break every bone in my body, but at least I'll be less arrogant.
So I decided to go retro on this whole autonomous vehicle movement.
Look!  symmetry!
It's OK.  I'm talking hands-free!
Her sashay is perfect! Book four weeks, seven days a week, twice on Sunday!
911 What is your  emergency?
My total life has been one of  rejection.
No, my Bronco doesn't have handsfree.
Before there was basketball the game of HORSE was a right more dangerous.
Hey! I don't think this mare cares much for dudes.
I hope he's calling a good orthopedic surgeon.
Let me just get off my bucking high horse.
But I WAS driving hands free!
I said, the market is STABLE!
I call this move ‘the Giuliani’.”
It IS like deleting Facebook
Using your cell phone does not work on horses, either.
Sorry, gotta hang.  Old Dobin here is getting restless.
You betcha! One selfie with a cracked spine comin' up!
Ya gotta do the twist
No Susan, I promise you, I'm not horsing around" After the Fall, I"ll call you
No, no, 911, I didn't say I'm getting hoarse
Oh, it's "bucking" bronco?
Hi dear. Any mail?
Don't be silly boss, I've always got a spare vacation minute to speak with you.
I am passing the buck as we speak.
Honey- Jack Palance didn't know the half of it."
Wow!  You never saw a cowboy with a necktie?

No Text Rodeo
Hi, I’d like to report a workplace injury
I gotta jump off.
Just bucking around, you?
I swear I wasn't looking at her! You're the only horse for me!
What’s it mean when he lays his ears ba- AAAAHHH!!
No need to apologize. I know a thing or two about flying off the handle.
Look up "Rodeo Fail" - I'm gonna be famous!
No, I said, a Bucking horse!
Include it in benefits.
We' re going to need an ambulance at the Dude Ranch.
Gotta go.  I'm getting ready to land
As I was saying, once they’ve seen me on the horse, this deal is sealed.

Damn dude! I told you to tell me if you were going to zag before you zig....
Honey gotta go.  First time I used the internet to get a ride with Uber, and now they want to drop me off.
I thought you told me the word was giddy up!
I called to catch up. But I'm leaping ahead.
I've think I've really bucked it up this time.
Hey don't worry about me, I hit the ground running
The new job allows me to hit the hay earlier.
Still a smoother ride than the economy
Was it something I said ?
Not much. I’m just horsing around. What’s new with you?
This whole mid-life crisis thing is great!
I'm up in the air about what the cattle call is going to be like.
Did you say Buck off?
Don't worry honey, I've got life insurance riders.
The new job sucks but the commute is a hoot.
And I’m using a flip phone
Yes, he promised he would show me he had more horsepower than any Mustang
Hey, can you believe they make you sign release forms at this dude ranch now?
I'm in training for my new job at the White House.  It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
Finally got cell reception.
Silly humans! They’re so oblivious. He didn’t even see the ghost!
Damn-it, Bob! This may be a bull market, but seriously ... no more horsing around here!
I'll call you back. I am about to get workers comp!
You always call me at the right time.
Mister, two hands on the reins, I might have brown teeth but no blue tooth.
911?  Yeah, it’ll be an emergency in just about one second.
I just got the best selfie!
Hello, emergency medical services? Would you please send an ambulance to the double bar TKO ranch immediately. Thanks.
This reminds me of my divorce,
So I had a few minutes to kill before our meeting,
Hold on - Just got in a WIFI Zone
I’m working from home, home on the range.
Will do. I'm heading right over.
Horsing around is for the birds, that I can tell you.
It looks like i'm getting roped in !!
Okay, thanks--  I guess I'll just have to get right back on the horse that threw me.
I’ve been thinking about switching to Bluetooth.
I have to do this in 8 seconds or less or I'm paying roaming fees.
Cancel my tee time. Golf has suddenly gotten old.
I can't today, I'm at the Agnes de Mille dance retreat.
I said this was a no call zone and I mean’t it!
Hang on a sec..traffic got a little rough..
Oh! I finally got service!
I think I’ll call him “trebuchet!”
I’d rather be bucked off a bronco than take that deal
I know you want me to commit to the relationship.  The Good News is that I am no longer on the fence.
We're definitely winning Dancing with the Stars!
I'm immersed in an Airbnb experience, may I call you back?
I can’t help myself — anything for another buck.
Customer service.  Please hold
I know how to make a quick buck.
Yeah, this new Bronco is a great ride!
Hello, mortuary?
Nothing much.. What are you up to?
Dude ranch is great. I feel like a million bucks!
Hi, I'd like to order a neck brace and 6 ice packs.
No bolo tie, no ride.
Operator: 'Sir,can you hold on? I'll be with you in a minute.
Yup, my flip phone is still working perfectly!
Why is he smiling? He didn't even make 1 second of his 8 second ride!
And then they said, 'Get off your high horse, Jim!'
This is how I like my Martini--Shaken, not Stirred!
Calls are a buck per minute
I'll give you a call from the hospital
I don't think the buck stops here, Bob.
Hey honey, this new car service app - ‘BUCKle UP’ - is  awesome...they sent me a Bronco and it’s one hell of a ride!
They're right. So much more fun than running for office.
Wait, I dropped my selfie stick.
Take it easy Bucko, this is my first rodeo!
Hey Martha, I'm calling out sick today. I'm about to get a concussion in 3-2-1.....
Things are a bit up in the air now.
Yeeeeeeha! Can you hear me now?
Excel just booted me—I'll need a minute to find those figures.
Yeeehaaaa!!!! Can you hear me now?
How about "The buck stops here" for our new logo?
Ma! Ma! Remember how you said I need some down time?
Roy and Trigger killin' it on DWTS.
"Just a second, I'll show you on Insta"
Sorry, dear - I thought you said 'get off your bucking high horse.
I'm not calling because my monthly phone plan is too high, you should see the only way I get good reception
And now what?
Ok fine! I'll only get pineapple on HALF the pizza
I'll call you back as soon as I am released from the emergency room!
You'd be surprised - it's a bigger rush than cocaine.
I know the call is breaking up, this horse doesn't have Bluetooth.
No! I'm not texting and riding.
Everything's going well so far!
And then what did he say?
Hi honey, I just crossed another one off the old bucket list!
Hold on a minute, it's Fall Waiting."
Can you hold on a sec?  There's someone on my other line.
Sure the market's volatile right now. I'm going to make a fortune!
Looks like the Apocalypse will have to settle for four horsemen.
Believe me, the buck stops here."
I can't talk now; I'm out in the field.
Let me phone you back; something just came up.
Gotta go, hon. I have another fall coming.
Tell the boss that this isn't my first rodeo.
Did you see the picture of me flying off of the horse? I hope it will get a lot of 'likes'.
He remembers me!!!
Hello, yes I am fine at the moment. On a whim I decided to try horseback riding but he does not seem to like my ring tone.
Don't be condescending, Tiff.  Of course, Texas has Uber.
These dumb humans should've figured out by now that there's no cellphone use during take off or landing.
Number twenty on my bucket list is a piece of  caaaaaaa...
My flight's about to land, call me later
I always knew I'd land in Texas
Listen, this call may drop in the next 8 seconds.
What's 'distracted riding'?"
At least Im a good Democrat. I would have fallen off an elephant much sooner.
Ha! No, what I said was BUCKING Bronco...
Thank God I'm only leasing this horse.
I think it's going pretty well.
Wow, that does sound like a unique timeshare opportunity!
Hello honey I finally got something to talk about on Facebook.
And to dust we shall return
It's only a buck a call
Uber, can you pick me up?
Hello,  is this 911 emergency?
Then he tells me to 'go get bucked' and I say, 'Hey, whatever - you're the boss.'
Let me call you back...
He tried to take me for a ride, but now I will get the real dirt.
Another one bites the dust....
Heck no I didn't waste all that money I spent on this dude ranch vacation.
This is my dream job", spoke Dave the horse
Let me call you back. Apparently this is a quiet pasture.
Say it, Forget it, Ride it, Regret it!
Just like in the movies, hon, so fun!
Buy Anthem!
Ha ha, yes, right now! I'm dying right now!
Peel an orange big and round ...
Another city slicker bites the dust.
Our relationship changed as of about 30 seconds ago. I really believe that.
Honey, we may not need a trampoline for the kids' party.
Hay, hay, hay!  We're just horsing around!
I told you that this horse could do Salsa!
At this moment I am falling head over heels for you.
You were right!  Reception IS great!!
He told me to hold my horses, and I said buck off!
I told you never to play the Mr. Ed Theme song when we're on speaker phone.
Becky listen, just ask anyone here how spontaneous I am!
You said it would be all about me this time!
Just a sec, I've got a great Instagram photo op.

You're a mean son-of-a-bitch of a horse, you know that?
I Didn’t vote for him.
My regular job?  Federal employee. I'm smiling because this horse is more fun than working for Donald
No! 911!
Oh you know, just another day at the rodeo. When’s dinner?
This team-building exercise is awesome!
$3.80 a pound. But that offer is good only for seven or eight more seconds.
My boss promised I'd get a raise.
Just the usual bucking around.  How about you?
Listen, that Bronco you booked for me turns out to be a fun of a ride.
I finally got back on the horse...and the cell service is fantastic from up here!
These are Real Ups & Downs and not the ones in The Street
Hi, is this dial-a-horse whisperer?
Go, you city- slicker, go!

Let me call you back honey, I'm in a rough spot.
Ha - my insurance company will never figure out "suicide by mustang"!
Not another dropped call.
Remember that career change I was thinking about?
Hello, Uber?! I don't think I meant a horse-ride when selecting an "environmentally conscious" option!
Too bad they don't come with bluetooth.
I’m so happy you called.  I  could use a good pick me up.
Hold my calls. This is gonna hurt.
So glad I got you, I've only got a sec...
So this is what Eric Cantor was talking about!!!
I'm flying high on bitcoin.
I haven't had this much fun since I voted for Trump!

Hold on a minute. I need to turn on my gyroscope app.
Honey, I've got a better signal!
Ha, ha.  Well, I gotta go now - I need to hit the ground running.
Sorry for the background noise- I'll go on mute.
Tell my doctor I'll be coming in tomorrow with a broken everything.
No … great timing. I’m just now leaving a meeting.
Sorry, I’ll get back to you! Just been thrown for a loop!
When you pick me up, bring me a clean shirt.
Just wanted to let you know: I expect I'll be late for dinner.
LMOA
Laughing Myself Over an Ass
I can’t talk now. I’m on the quiet stallion.
Can you believe - I used to always worry 
about breaking something.
But Siri I did'not say HE was a horse's ass!
Just out stress-testing our health insurance coverage, honey.
Bronco riding is the event after the bull market.
Yipee Ki Yay, my iphone still works out here.
Sorry, I've gotta hang up!
Alexa. Call me an ambulance.

Not the pas de deux I expected, but thrilling.
Me? I'm just horsing around.
Nice meeting you tooooooooooooooooooo
Just horsing around the OK corale. What are you up to?
Not all horses like Abba.."
At the White Collar Rodeo, the rider with the most selfies before falling wins!
He heard you call me a horse's ass, that's what!
Hold on. I'll see if he's free to talk.
Order the Attorney General to tell the horse to behave.
Whee!  Finally figured out how to use all my sick days!
Damn - I really underestimated those Republicans.
No, no! I said BUCKING horse!
No one was able to predict the distracted horse riding epidemic of the 2020's.
I'll try to take a Selfie.
This is what happens when you talk and ride.
Yes, I can hear you now.
Call Michael Cohen and tell him I can't do this job either
Wait -- he lost me.
Horse: He may know about bulls and bears - but he sure knows nothing about broncos!
Talk about passing the buck.

I told you to quit horsing around!
Land this triple-rotation jump, and they'll get full points in the rodeo free dance!
No, I'm not driving ....
Think so, eh? This is not my first rodeo!
Adulting at its finest
You were right.  Office boy, not cowboy.
Get your own ride
Book me a room in the hospital
Honey, I’m a few bucks from my big break!
I said "I'll phone you after this incredible buck!"
Having Fun? He who laughs last, laughs best.
If you fall off a horse, get right back on to never leaving home and watching Netflix.
This one would be a long shot!
Sorry, must 'ang up.
Sara (Sanders), tell the "enemy of the people" that it was the greatest dismount in the history of horse riding.

How long have you wanted to do this?
Breaking in New Shoes.
Remember how you said I always do things on the fly?
Hey Paul, I have a feeling I'm about to enter a dead zone.
The really funny part is that I only paid a buck for this ride in the first place!

I did not raise you to be a bully!
I was thrown left, so not this horse.
I'll be down soon!
Relax, mom! I haven't had time to get back on the horse yet.
Yeah, I'll be landing in Denver soon.

Okay Honey, a gallon of milk and  a dozen eggs, do you need me to get anything else on the way home?
Who, me, sound shaky?
You gotta get out here, quickest buck I've ever made!
I told you, that tie does not go with my mane!
Can I call you back? I'm slammed.

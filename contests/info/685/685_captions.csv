I don't know how to tell him it's not his.
At least the hard part's over.
Arthur's third wish was for a 'young chick.'
It's for our retirement.  Harold always takes things so literally.
But will he lift a finger after it hatches?
Turns out it wasn’t a kidney stone after all.
To be honest, I don’t remember which one came first
I’d leave him if he weren’t such a good lay.
We say that whatever it is we're going to love it, as long as it's healthy and doesn't try to eat us.
I didn’t know he had it in him, either.
We like "Humpty", if it is a boy.
Costco, where else?
You're so lucky. I can't even get my husband to water the plants.
I should've asked for specifics when he said he had a nest egg.
I thought you were empty nesters.
I don't mind him sitting on it.  It's the clucking that annoys me.
These are the things that no one tells you about before you marry an ornithologist.
His left one has already been removed..
On the bright side, he’s cage free.
Did Jim always wear glasses?
Don’t ask why. Ask how.
We don't care if it's a brontosaurus or a t-rex, as long as it's healthy.
He's brooding again.
I haven’t the heart to tell him that he’s not the father...
It's only fair. I had to lay it.
It was the only thing at Ikea that he didn't have to assemble.
Then he said, I’ll hatch an egg before they impeach him!
Somewhere, there’s a confused but comfortable chicken sitting in a BarcaLounger.
No, it's better. For years he's been sitting on the fence.
I’m just praying the real mother doesn’t come back.
When it was golf ball-sized I warned him to call the doctor.
He thinks it'll distract people from noticing his bald spot.
Ever since he retired all he does is lay around the house all day.
I don't know what's in there, but I'm not cleaning up after it.
After this, he flies North for winter, thank God.
At least somethings getting laid here
When's the species reveal party?
Quit your whining. I hatched the first three all by myself.
I  don't have the heart to tell him it's hard-boiled.
It’s a donor egg.
He won’t stop tweeting.
Yes, Herb has both gender AND species issues.
Well, at least he's off his high horse.
That's what I thought, too, when he bragged about the size of his nest egg.
Hmmm. Seems you may have misunderstood your financial advisor, Jonathan.
Well it's not mine, I can tell that much.
Ever get the feeling you're a cartoon in the New Yolker?
28 Days!?! Men always get it is SOOO easy.
You told him "nest egg" is a metaphor, right?
He has to sit on it until he's 65, then we can retire.
Dammit, Harold!  
"Blow it out your ass" is only an expression,
Horace thought we should pre-order our Thanksgiving turkey this year.
This is why you're never supposed to swallow bubble gum.
Now you see why I'm always walking on eggshells around him.
Oh, stop brooding Harold.
I wish he'd go back to work. All he does is brood.
I told him "Jim, grow a pair". Unfortunately he can't multitask
Are you sure it's yours?
He’s actually being a good sport.  We ordered a recliner.
We could get rich, or, it eats him alive. Either way it's worth it.
Been in his family for millions of years... but Fred says that one day ...
I don’t know how it happened.  All I know is somewhere there’s a pterodactyl waiting for a recliner to hatch.

What can I say?  I married a Hatcher.
We finally came up with something he can do in retirement.
We're having 18 people over for an omelette on Saturday.
Our previous sitter got hit by a car while crossing the road
I shouldn't have let him choose our egg donor.
He's the one who wanted kids. You figure it out, I said.
Well look at that, Frank. You finally laid a chick.
I should never let Harold shop at Costco by himself.
We're hoping for an emu.
You are  SO lucky.  My husband gambled away most of our savings.
Are you sure you spell-checked your request for an ergonomic chair?
I told him not to swallow his bubblegum.
Every one else’s husband gets a sport car for their midlife crisis.
I'd take him to a therapist but we need the eggs.
The doctor thinks it's empty nest syndrome.
I thought you were getting that lanced?
You feel sorry for him? I laid it.
I'm taking bets on which one cracks first.
You should have been here when he laid it!
He accidentally ordered an eggonomic chair instead of ergonomic.
And we still have nothing to talk about.
If I feed him beans it stays inflated.

And then he said, "what's the worst that could happen?"
He's always so literal.  I told him to blow it out his ass.

Cage-free?
I'm telling you, Cheryl, the things we have to do to get a grandchild these days.
I told him that if he's just going to sit around the house all day, he might as well make himself useful.

We met on Hatch.com.
In 21 days, we'll have a futon.
I'm not entirely sure Bill is understanding the concept of a nest egg.
I’m telling you, it’s just a matter of days before he cracks.”

That’s the most parenting he’s done in 50 years.
And worse yet, he thinks he's the father.
The dermatologist said he shouldn’t squeeze it.
So, George,...anything new?
He also ordered a giant chicken, but we all know the egg comes first
I doubt his butt is warm enough.
He was sitting around warming the sofa all day anyway so I thought, hey, why not make him useful?

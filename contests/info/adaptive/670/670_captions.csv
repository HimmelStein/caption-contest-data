He went right from crawling to stand-up!
Thanks, you've been a great audience, I'll be awake all night.
My next guests I have known my entire life.
Look, honey! He skipped crawling and went straight to stand-up!
I'd like to start off by saying—thanks for having me, folks!
America, are you ready for a change?  I know I am
Let's have a hand for the folks who made this all possible.
Thank you, thank you.  Don't miss my next show, at 2 AM.
... and also big thanks to those tuning in on the baby monitor.
My next number will be a Number Two.
Thank you! I’ll be back at 1am, 3am, and 5am!
He's the only candidate actually calling for a change
I love his bedtime routine.
'Thanks, you're a great audience and I'll be here all week and at least until my mid-thirties."
Look!  He's speaking without crib notes!
He went from crawling to stand-up overnight!
He's got a million listeners and an eight-word vocabulary. FOX News is offering his own series.
Now we just need to neglect him so he'll have lots of material.
I'd like to thank my producers...
And another thing. Why do people say, “Last night I slept like a baby”? I guess that’s fine if they woke up screaming and peed the bed. Heh heh...You guys are great. I’m here all week!
How about a nice round of applause for the couple that lives down the hall.
Listen, dear, he's learned all the words he needs to be President.
Maybe we should have played Mozart instead of Sinatra.
The time for a change is now!
He’s really been working on his bedtime routine.
Did you hear the one about the dirty diaper? Never mind, it stinks.
And now, for the two people who made it all possible...
And none of this would have been possible without two very special people.
Well he can't be any less qualified than our current President.
I see we have our two regulars here for the late show.
So a thumb-sucker and a bed-wetter walk into a bar...
Look Honey, he's already more articulate than Trump.
Incomplete sentences.  Limited vocabulary.  Slurred words.  Ill-fitting clothes. The military as props in the background.  An inauguration-sized crowd.  Honey, I think someday our Joey could be the president!
Take my brother. Please.
I told you Jerry Seinfeld was a great choice for a sperm donor!
The fake microphone’s a stroke of genius. He’s stopped tweeting!
When I was born I was so ugly the doctor slapped my mother.
See I told you he did stand up!
And he's not even using crib notes!
Look, he's doing stand up.
Heeeeeere’s Mommy!
And for my second word...
Look, honey. He's not even using crib notes!
He's speaking nonsense! We might be the parents of a future president.
Sooo, have you heard the one about the two people who thought I was sleeping?
He just started crawling, but this is his first stand up!
I’m here all week, and well into my 30s.
Thank you all for coming! My next set is at 3:17 AM.
Look at him honey - the small hands, the tantrums, the hair, the impulsive behavior. Plus he can't read and never makes sense when he tries to talk.
I know it's a crowded field but I really think he can win.
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 2... Can you smell what it is?
He says it’s time for a change.
I can't wait until we can actually understand what he is saying.
See? He already deported the bear.
Add public speaking to the preschool application.
He skipped crawling and went right to stand-up!
Check, check. Is this thing on? Can someone please hand me my bear?
Let me start by saying its been a great year so far.
I know words. I have the best words.
His bedtime routine gets me every time.
Look Honey, He's doing Stand Up!
He’ll mention us, Frank, after he thanks his sponsors.
I'd like to thank my Mom and Dad, who are here tonight.
Look, honey, he's playing his first room!
The doctor says his sense of timing is in the ninety-ninth percentile.
I prefer his earlier stuff.
He’s running for President. They want a candidate with nothing embarrassing in his background.
He went straight from crawling to standup!
He really nailed his first TEDDY Talk.
Eighteen months of pee-pee jokes. Now, finally, some dry humor.
...and a round of applause for my parents, who came all the way from the living room for tonight's show.
Oh, look, Fred. Our little Donald just said his first lie!
I’d like to dedicate this one called “Screaming at the top of my lungs” to my mom and dad.
I'm here to announce I too am running. And shortly, I also expect to be walking,
And he just speaks off the cuff, with no crib sheets!
Look -- he's giving his first Teddy talk!
At six months he makes more sense than the Mother Fucker Trump.


NOTE: I'm sure I won't win with this one but at least I feel better. PB
...and I would like to be the second baby to occupy the Oval Office.
Do you think the White House will notice he’s gone?
My next guests need no introduction.
I guess the bear will think twice before heckling him again.
I'm the greatest baby!  Believe me, no baby is greater than me!
I’m not president yet but, 
“I am full of shit”
The limited vocabulary, infantile world view and lack of experience are considered assets by his base.
I'll be right back after a short nap.
The pediatrician said it's perfectly normal if he bombs on the first night.
A funny thing happened to me on the way through the cervix.
Let’s see who his guests are first before  we say anything.
No, I do not have a dirty diaper.  Never had.  FAKE NEWS!
His humor is a bit infantile.
Hush, here comes the part of the acceptance speech where he thanks his mother.
And don't get me started on parents.
Oh look, honey! He's declaring for the Democratic presidential nomination!
I'm so glad we weaned him off the teleprompter.
I believe we have a movement here and its time for a change"
I just got in from Pittsburgh and boy are my hands and knees tired.
Thank you all for coming.  I'm happy to say that today I'm six months off the bottle.
He's already making more sense than Trump.
Look he's already doing stand up.
Ah, and here they are now. Ladies and Gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to My Parents.
I'm so glad we did Improv classes instead of Lamaze.
He sounds so much better live than on the baby monitor.
For my next number ...two!
This is Eric reporting live from under the mobile.
All those TED talks I attended while I was pregnant are finally paying off!
I knew we shouldn’t have let her watch the debates.
Wait 'til I tell Madge Schwartz. Her baby only does calculus.
And for my next cry, I dedicate it to the couple who agree with me that I am the center of the universe.
Oh George!  He’s announcing his entry into the Democratic primary!
Can you believe he's already speaking at a presidential level?
And I said, ‘What stinks more? The economy, or my diaper?’
And why is it called a mobile, anyway? It never goes anyplace. Amiright?
Sure it’s narcissistic gibberish....our baby could be President some day!
I love his humor. He's so self-defacating!
He's filibustering to avoid taking a nap.
It's mostly toilet humor, but that's how everyone starts.
Oh, Fred. His first word! 
"Covfefe!"
Listening to George Carlin in utero worked. He got all seven words correct.
And here's.............Mommy!"
A teddy bear walks into a bar ...
I know it's gibberish, but his foreign policy still makes more sense the president.
I would now like to thank my parents,  without whom none of this would be possible.
Oh Honey, he's about to tell his first lie!
And now a brief message from the people who made all this possible.
And here they are now!  How about a little love for my producers!
Finally, a candidate who appeals to younger voters!
So, are you two a couple?
And breast-feeding....what's up with that
It’s so cute seeing him rally his imaginary base.
His first words - “Is this thing on?”
So sweet that his first words were "Is this mic on?
He looks so presidential!
And now, let's welcome two people I've known forever.
So a baby walks into a bar and the bartender says, we don't serve babies. So the baby says, I was just looking for a bottle!
Did you hear that? His first joke was about Mom"
...and lastly, I'd like to thank my egg donor, my sperm donor and my gestational mother. I love you all.
He's demanding tanks, Blue Angel flyovers, and a fresh bottle.
I wish he would call us Mom and Dad, not "a lovely audience."
This way we won’t miss his first words!
Let's not tell him he has only two followers.
Look, he's speaking without a teleprompter!
Just had a big dinner and boy am I  pooped
Do you think we're taking his 'first words' moment too far?
Testing. Testing. One. Two. Um, five?
Next thing you know, he'll be lying to the press.
I love his new bedtime routine!
Oh honey, he has your need for attention!
The book did say this is when he'd start working on his speech!
For example, take my parents.... please!
I think it’s best if we just let him filibuster himself to sleep.
Don’t stop him. He makes more from his YouTube channel that you do.
Thanks! I'll be up again every hour for the next three nights!
Sure, free toys for everyone sounds good, but how do we pay for them?
I was in the womb the other day, minding my own business, when boom this masked man starts spanking me. I get no respect...
First, I'd like to thank my Mom and Dad, without whom I wouldn't be here today.
And now "Memories,"  the short version.
His nanny-cam was picked up by Netflix!
Look, honey. He just said his first alternative fact!
I'm here all week, try the breast milk.
Now if he could only learn to talk!
I promise you, a change is coming.
Listen to all that babbling. He’s nearly ready to run for office.
Who knew standing up was the hardest part of comedy?
He's fired his teddy bear!
I told you singing to him when I was pregnant would pay off.
What’s the deal with pull-ups?  I mean c’mon, people. Are they diapers?  Are they plastic briefs?”
He's bound to be president, he's already behind bars...!
The state of the nursery is strong.
So whats the deal with parents?
His stand-up routine is so much better now that he can actually stand up.
Sure, he does a lot of poop jokes. But he's so AUTHENTIC!
Surely he’ll be walking soon. He’s already mastered stand up.
I'm so proud! He did all that without crib notes!
I have decided to seek the Democratic nomination for president
Seems like just yesterday he was doing sit-up.
Oh Honey! He just told his first lie!
The store was out of baby monitors, so I improvised.
Honey, I think he just told his first lie!
Take my diaper... please.
I'm just worried he'll never be able to support himself.
I just flew in from DC and I'm literally pooped.
Covfefe
Mom, Dad? I'm gay.
Stop me if you've heard the one about the baby and the helicopter parents.
Good evening, children. Welcome to another chilling episode of 
'Tales from the Crib.
It was a tremendous nap. The most tremendous nap. Any other nap is a loser.
So I says, 'Diaper? I hardly know her!'
And he's just what Biden needs to counter the age thing!
Oh Howard, let’s stay for another set.
Oh listen, honey, he’s telling his first lie.
He's so at ease at the mic. No crib notes.
Oh, honey, can you believe it? He's speaking without his teleprompter!
Well, except for saying George Washington captured airports, that was brilliant.
He’s got your misguided confidence.
One baby step for me, one flying leap for my bear.
I felt like the baby monitor was keeping him from his full potential.
...and what’s with diaper rashes? They put a man on the moon and they can’t stop diaper rash? Really???
For my first and next fifty songs, I will be singing "Baby Shark."
Thank you, I'm here all this week - try the breast milk.
Isn't he hysterical?" 
"I'm just glad he's grown out of his Lenny Bruce phase.
This is his biggest gig since the ultrasound.
Do you think he's deranged or just precocious?
I have a few first words.
Today, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
And diaper rash, what’s up with that?
With the eyes of the nation upon me, I would like to announce that I have wet myself.
Finally a Democratic candidate who can go head to head with Trump on his level.
Why can't we just have a baby monitor like other new parents?
Jane's daughter didn't start her podcast until she was 2!
He’s come a long way from writing jokes for other babies.
Looks like Teddy lost the debate.
And then he said, "Is that a dirty diaper or did dad make lunch again?"
It's so cute when he calls us fake parents.
Spank me if you’ve heard this one before ...
Yes, but they're insightful potty jokes.
It is with great regret that I announce the passing of Teddy.
we'll potty train him after the campaign.
I'm just glad I don't have to share this crib with 19 other candidates.
Thanks for having me.
You’re both fired!
He's a natural stand-up!
He got a full diaper and likes to hear himself talk. He's our little politician!
Is he imitating Trump or is Trump imitating him?
He said, 'Heeeeere's Mommy!'
Now they can become president first, and then grow up.
Look Phil, he's gone from crawling to stand up.
We're sending these planes and ships to Iran as soon as we figure out how to unhook them from the ceiling.
His jokes are great but he’s got quite the potty mouth.
The 2 a.m. set is completely different from the 4 a.m. set.
I told you he was ready for stand up.
He's a born politician.  His message makes no sense.
Let’s bring on the people who made this all possible.
Wait! You gotta hear him do his impression of you.
Teething pain! Am I right?
It used to seem like gibberish, but these days it sounds presidential.
He's starting to campaign for 2056
He's going to make infancy great again!
First and foremost, i'd like to say that my diaper needs to be changed.
Parenting is easy, comedy is hard.
He’s throwing his diaper in the ring for 2020!
Oh sure, it’s funny when he says it.
I can't believe the 2058 campaign is already under way.
He’s a natural-born politician – he didn’t answer a single question!
He's already making more sense than Trump, and he throws fewer tantrums
Six months and he’s already doing stand up!
Just yesterday he rolled over, and now he can do stand-up!
I'd like to thank my mother and father... that's pretty much it... thank you.
I smell an encore coming.
"I told you he was a born politician––he's already thrown Teddy under the bus!"
Thanks for coming. This is truly my first time doing stand up.
Thanks, I'll be here the next 17 years!
And we were afraid he’d never talk
He did his whole monologue without a crib sheet!
Forgive me if the material's a little juvenile.
See?  I always knew that bear was holding him back.
Gee, all the books said he wouldn't be podcasting for another six months.
They grow up so fast. A week ago he could barely crawl. Now he’s doing stand-up.
Look at our little boy, from crawling to stand up!
Buying the Rodney Dangerfield sample from the sperm bank was worth every penny!
Oh John, he's announcing his candidacy for 2056.
Teddy bears are drug dealers, criminals, murderers, rapists . . .
And don't forget, I'll be back for another show at 3:00AM
He's already qualified to become President!
Thank you - I’ll be here every night
His ability to read the room puts him in the 85th percentile for his age!
Stand-up comedy?  I didn't know he could stand up!
And I'd like to thank my parents, Bob and Linda, for having me.
Before the field gets too crowded, 
I'm announcing my candidacy 
for the 2050 Democratic Primary.
Ladies and gentlemen, take my parents...please!
He can finally entertain himself!
I knew we should've never moved to L.A.
Frank, I'm so proud!  He's gone right from spit up to stand up!
He sounds so presidential!
Take my mom...please.
What's a guy gotta do to get a clean diaper around here?
Look, he learned to stand-up!
And now....the lucky winners of the diaper change challenge!
Steve,  his first "Your-Mama" joke.
And this one goes out to a very special couple...
Look at him! Last week he could barely crawl, today he's doing standup!
What's the deal with onesies? They don't call pants and shirts twosies.
No, wait — he’s killing it.
He snivels, won't listen, throws tantrums, denies responsibility, behaves badly in public, wears ill-fitting clothes, has bad hair, and doesn't know much.  So why not?
I'd like to dedicate this next song to the folks who brought me here by accident."
Your theory about replacing Mozart with Seinfeld reruns really worked!
He’s a born politician.  He just threw Teddy under the bus!
And for my next number... 2.
Tales from the Crib
Of course it’s gibberish, but at least he’s standing up for something!
Now I want you to think of a number between one and two.
We should have expected this when his first word was "Grammy."
And now I would like to thank my parents, who are clueless but necessary.
Imagine not remembering where you passed out and waking up in a pile of your own excrement. Hi. My name is Ryan and I'm a toddler.
He went directly from rolling over to stand-up.
Which one of us should tell him how to pronounce “nuclear”?
When the press hears he tickled Elmo, his campaign is over
Look honey, Ted talks!
I owe everything to my mom and dad who are in the audience tonight.  I wouldn't be here today if not for them.
Guess who's the new White House press secretary?!?
I told you naming him Donald was a mistake
Thanks Teddy...my next guests are from my own home town.
I think he's going to start talking any day now.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I'm here until I'm eighteen.
Look, Honey, he’s already doing
stand up!
A priest, a rabbi and my Dada walked into a bar...
Our child does not need a babysitter; he needs an agent!
He’s raised 3.5 million since nap time.
And I say to Mr. Teddy Bear, tear down this wall!!
Oh god, is he running too?
Oh, he has your father's dry wit and my uncle's delayed timing!
Take my midwife...please.
He didn't just learn to stand up, he's got ten minutes of good material.
He'll be playing the living room in no time!
Come on Sweetie, show daddy how you’re going to pay for college.
Yesterday he dedicated his tantrum to me.
This is Georgie’s new bit: The Seven Words You Can Never Say At Daycare.
Teddy Talks!
Oh honey, who knew ‘testing’ would be his first word.
His first word was "impeach"!
His fans are gonna go gaga!
We might have overdone it with speech therapy.
Oh honey, his first statement from behind bars!
At least if we’re bad parents he’ll have good material.
I get no respect. When I was a kid my parents moved a lot. But I always found them.
You're listening to Baby Talk. Tonight, the efficacy of binkies. Go ahead, caller.
He’s finally dropped Teddy from his act.
His fans don’t seem to mind that he can’t talk, as long as he says “MAGA” once in a while.
He’ll be perfect! No voting record, no embarrassing affairs and no Twitter trail.
A baby crawls into a bar...
First, I wish to say that I do not intend to make my opponent's age an issue in this campaign.
Wow, talking gibberish already- he really could be president someday!
Next he’ll want tanks and a parade.
Oh, sweetheart, it's his first podcast.
All this sleeping through the night BS - FAKE NEWS!
Next question....
But seriously pops, you look great tonight.  I don’t know if mom should hug you or play tic-tac-toe on your shirt.  You’re killing me over here.
He just said " heeeeere's Mommy ."
Thanks, I'll be here until 2036!
I'm so excited. His first podcast without the bear.
What's the deal with bedtimes?
It's an honor just to be born
Diaper check ... 1... 2... 3.
People of Earth...
He's very anxious to to announce his candidacy, but the pediatrician told him he needs to learn to walk before he can run.
Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking . . .
Look, dear -- he's already grasped the value of adding military imagery  to his addresses!
My reason for running is because  I believe the current occupant of the White House is too childish.
Trust me — preschool admissions will love a podcast.
How cute.  He's already got a stand-up routine.
He's going to make childhood great again.
Well, it's already been proven that any infant can get elected.
Other toddlers stand up.  Ours DOES stand-up!
And now for my next act, I am going to burp and fill my diaper at the same time.
Thanks, folks. I'll be here for the next couple of years.
We shall defend our right to suck our thumb, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight them on the play ground, we shall fight them at the Day Care,  we shall fight them at home and in the streets, we shall never surrender.
He's already speaking like the President
It's ok honey, the dr said he's just politically precocious.
Our very own Speaker of the House!
Oh, his first lie!
He's just a baby - let him enjoy playing commander in chief.
Look, he's gone from crawling to standup.
Who does he think is listening?
Change me if you’ve heard this one.
They said his podcast on poor parenting went viral.
Hello, is this thing on? Can someone please pick up my bear and bring me my guitar?
Don't you think he's a wee bit young to be singing, "I Did It My Way?"
Parents, am I right?
And after he learns to speak, it will be even better!
This is not what we anticipated when we told him to "stand up".
And this next one is for all the little people yearning to be free.
His earlier work was more edgy.
And stop me if you've heard this one before. We're all drinking milk.... seriously have you seen where it comes from? You've been a great crowd!
Read My Lips: No New Vegetables!”
And you said all that whining didn’t sound presidential!
Tonight, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.
Another milestone reached - he's now qualified to be President!
Look, honey--he added a second show just for you.
I told you that Jerry Seinfeld Sperm Bank was the right place.
This one is going out to my old gang from the East 72nd St lamaze class.
He’s already polling better than nineteen other candidates.
He just said his first word... Bigly!
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen Two shows nightly, try the formula.
What's the deal with parents? Am I right?
Donnie said he's getting a bigger crib and the neighbors will pay for it.
Little Donald just uttered his first exaggeration.
Well honey, he was conceived during the debate, remember?
I couldn't find the baby monitor so I had to improvise
But first a word from my sponsors.
Thank you, thank you very much!  The next scream on my play list is called "Feed Me!"  .....and it goes something like this......
Look, honey -- our boy is doing his first standup!
Morris, I think he's finally ready to talk
Just imagine, in 70 years he’ll still be bald, drooling, slurring his words and running for President.
I will now attempt the very difficult "jump over the 2 1/2-foot rail from a standing position".
It's great to be back at The Playpen.
And we were worried he would grow up to become a doctor!
He’s funny, but he has a bit of a potty mouth.
Our son will be the second toddler president!
We knew he'd stand up by now, but he already has a solid 10 minutes of material!
What’s with parents? Is the Hokey Pokey really what it’s all about?
PROMISE, I'LL NEVER WATCH THE DEBATES WHEN I AM PREGNANT AGAIN .
Thank you! Thank you! I’ll be up all night!
Anyway, my blanket left me.
He's already demagoguing at a 4th-grade level!
Take my parents for example, no really take them!
He sings "Highway to Hell" one more time and I am going to throttle him.
I'm announcing my candidacy for the 2020 election. It's not fair the the Republicans already have a baby on their side.
I’ll be right back after a word with my sponsors.
Throw tantrums, it shows that you're winning.
Our little Ted talks!
Filibustering is just a phase, dear. He'll call you 'dada' any day now.
Ha! Those in utero jokes crack me up every time.
What is he running for? He can't even walk!
Honey, it was his first address without crib notes!
If anyone is listening, I would like to go to the bathroom"
I owe my whole standup career and dry bottom to my next guests.
Overboard bear, full diaper, ain't nuthin but the blues.
All I said was "you could grow up to be president"
It's his podcast show "Crib Notes".
I accept your nomination for a second term as President of the United States.
To tell you the truth, I never liked Tigger.  He was low intelligence and his fur smelled like a wet diaper
Aw, honey, his first words."
" Yeah but 'Nessun dorma'? What does that even mean?
... so I asked mom why she insists that I call the mailman Uncle Mike ... just joking Dad (ba-da-boom)... Thank you everyone, I'll be here all week... and for the next 17 or 18 years by the way... hey, is this an audience or a finger painting?
Why not? There's an infant in the White House now.
I thought the doctor said standing at 8 months, not stand up.
So two teletubies and a Rabbi go into a bar....
And so I say, ‘That’s not a bottle! That’s my mother!’ You’ve been a great crowd, New York! Goodnight!
He nailed the stand up part. If only he'd written some material.
My God!  He can’t walk, but he’s already doing stand-up.
It's so sweet - he's waived the two drink minimum for us!
With the extent of his vocabulary he could be president right now.
His first word: testing!
And another thing: what's with nipples on men?
He may have your set up but his delivery is all mine.
I always knew he'd do stand-up before he'd walk.
I just flew into town and boy is my stork tired!
Finally a comedian that can't complain about their childhood!
If you want to record baby's first sounds, put the microphone on the other end.
He said he would waive the 2 bottle minimum.
Wait ‘til you hear his stance on immigration reform. It’s adorable!
When you said he was standing up I didn't realize 
you meant he was doing stand-up!
Show of hands, how many folks here are my folks?
His podcast in baby talk gibberish has gone viral among Trump supporters."
He's running on a platform of universal snacks and raising the minimum bedtime.
My mama’s so old that her breast milk is actually powder.
The bit about unaffordable daycare - hilarious!”
And...give it up for my parents!  They'll be here indefinitely!
And he's already got more followers than Mike Pence!
So today I will be saying my tenth word: Adroit.
…Any parents here tonight?
I just crawled in from the coast...
Da..da? Is there a Dada in the audience?
Did you hear that, Honey?  His first words...' bone spurs' "
Thank you for watching my TED Talk
Did he say, "Anybody here from Jersey?"
Emily's baby wasn't live-casting till 1 1/2!
Thank you, folks! I’ll pee here all week!
His stand-up routine is great, but he cries when he gets heckled.
I'll be here all night, folks.
He looks so ...electable !!
Yo, welcome to my crib, with a shout out to my genetic antecedents.
And to my parents, if it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t be here. This one’s for you!
Well you try to put together a stand-up act with a three-word vocabulary.”
He can do stand-up as long as he's holding on to something!
Take my crib ... please
That's the best State of the Room address he's ever given!
If he's going to keep us awake, at least he puts on a show.
And now ladies and gentleman, hailing all the way from dinner, please welcome Mom's boyfriend and my new father!
Introducing: Baby Gaga!
You can't let him watch Fox News anymore.
Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here until I'm 18.
You're right, he does look like Winston Churchill.
Look Honey! His first public apology!
Oh Look! Another future world leader with tiny hands !
I thought he could only do lie-down comedy.
Now that I have your attention my diaper needs some!
Thank you. I’ll be here all night. At least, that’s what my parents are hoping.
And if elected, I promise you there will be no more mandatory nap times...
...and so, I'm happy to announce that I am running for president of the United States.
Take my parents, please
A clown, a juggler and a puppeteer walk into an ice cream parlour...
He just gets better with age...
President Buttigieg's parents watch him deliver his first speech to the American people.
Oh, honey, isn’t it great? We can add public speaking to the Little Sunflower Preschool application!
He’s so gifted. No teleprompter.
Wasn’t that just the most amazing rendition of “The Wheels on the Bus” you’ve ever heard?
We'll call his podcast "Crib Notes."
Hopefully his big mouth will compensate for his small hands someday.
He may seem immature at times, but at least he says what he thinks.
Sorry about the tantrum earlier. It turns out my mom's been sleeping with my dad.
I see my dinner has arrived.  Be back in 10 for my Sinatra medley.
I liked his earlier work better.
Hello, and welcome to my BED Talk
And I love the way he just pardoned himself!
See? I told you he would run before he could crawl.
Early retirement here we come.
Thanks folks, you're the best. I'm here for 35 years. Try the veal.
Welcome to the next episode of "Tales from the Crib"
I TOLD you 'Mike' was the perfect name for him.
Oh sure, when his opening joke needs changing he's MY son.
Look...It’s Jim & Carole! Get a room you two...why, because I want a sibling. But seriously, folks...
He's looking more presidential every day.
He's babbling!  Oh honey, he's ready for politics!
Covfefe? Whatever could he mean?
I think we're his next guests.
So, a priest, a rabbi and an imam walk into a maternity ward . . .
Yep, he’s a natural politician.  I knew it when I saw him with his foot in his mouth.
I’m gonna need more reverb and a little more ME in the monitor please.
Take a picture, photoshop in an audience, and we can buy our way into any elite preschool.
When you told me our baby was trying stand up this was not what i expected
I know he’s just trying to avoid bedtime, but it’s his first campaign speech!
Thanks a lot, folks; I’ll be here for the next 25 years.
‘Ice cream for all’ sounds great, but how is he going to pay for it?
We need a clean up on aisle one.
‘Sure, he’s funny, but the material is a little infantile for my taste.’
Look, honey. He went right from crawling to stand up.
Oh, honey. He wants tanks for the Fourth of July!
How cute! His first words... ‘Hello, hello. Is this damn thing on?’
What's the deal with breastfeeding? I mean, you're not feeding the breast...
Baby's first words - is this thing on?
Thank you! I’ll be here till bedtime. Try the milk.
He's weak on abortion, but I love his plan for free daycare.
Wait! I think he’s going to deliver his first incoherent diatribe!
Thank goodness! He supports cradle to grave Medicare.
Look-he does standup.
My parents scolded me last night. I have to tell you they are both losers. And my mother is a nasty woman. Lock her up!
I can't believe our son is Trump's new Interim Secretary of Defense! And you said that mobile was a waste of money!
He's already graduated from potty humor to observational.
And the doctah says,"Why are YOU cryin'? I gotta clean up this mess!"
Keep smiling, he hasn't noticed it's not plugged in.
Thank you.  I'll be here for the next 18-26 years.
His applesauce routine is hilarious!
Honey, he's "Live From the Crib" again!
Initially I said he was too young, but he did so well in the first debate.
At this stage it’s mostly observational.
...and finally, I want to thank my teddy bear and pacifier for their continued support and encouragement during the filming of this documentary ....
And now for my weekly podcast, From the Crib.
Just wait till you hear his bit about potty training!
Isn't this wonderfully American—amplifying the voices of people who have nothing to say!
He's about to say the darndest thing, I just know it!
You can never start too early apologizing for youthful indiscretions.
It doesn't have to make sense. He's practicing to be President one day.
Let's welcome the people who made all this possible ! A big hand for my Mom and Dad!
Heeeer's Mommy!
His first daddy roast.
Oh look, honey!  Junior just shut down his first heckler!
Soon he'll be tweeting!
I don’t understand the lyrics, but I think it’s a hit for his generation!
Alexa! Call CPS - i am being held captive in a cell!
He is so presidential!
Oh honey, our baby is the funniest comedian behind bars since Bill Cosby
His first F-bomb!
My next song is a little number by the Supremes called Baby Love.
I told you we didn't need a baby monitor.
For my next act I will potty train myself
He's got the hands of a president too.....
They usually don’t start media training for another six months.
Yes it’s childish, but it’s his first TED Talk!
Remember it’s a two bottle minimum.
Oh Honey...he looks so presidential!
Shh... He's about to announce his first words
Oh,Honey I think he's getting ready to talk!
Don't interrupt him. I wanna hear what his platform is.
I'll worry if he starts building hotels.
I know it's a shock, dear.  But we have to think positive.  If he has a knack for politics, he'll never have to work a day in his life.
His first alternative fact!
I told you he shouldn't have watched the debates with us.
His first crib-side address!
His first words were check one two.
He's already polling ahead of Marianne Williamson!
Isn't that precious? He just promised Mexico will pay for the bars on his crib.
And now I’d like to thank all the little people.
She sighed and they".......I'm afraid I'll have to finish this story later.  You know who just came into the nursery
Thank you!  I'm here until i'm 18. Be sure to tip my parents.
I never would have guessed his first word would be ‘impeachment.’
Just last week I saw him jotting down ideas for his first word!
And he said ‘who’s that lady?’ And I said, ‘that’s no lady, that’s my Mom’...
I would like to start by thanking my parents for their support over the months.
Well, he's got a face for radio...
I know he's young honey but his ideas are much better than anyone they've got so far.
Oh John, Look. Another Democrat candidate for President in 2020!
I want to give a shout out to my parents who are in the audience tonight.
Yo momma so dumb, she took a ruler to bed to see how long I slept.
We're just in time for his opening monologue!
He stinks, but at least not like a dirty diaper
I love his bit about object permanence.
I don't know about collusion but based on that smell coming from his diaper I could have told him there was no obstruction.
Honey, shouldn’t preschool come before the primaries?
Just think, he'll be only the second baby to give The State of the Union Address!
With all that talent I'm starting to wonder if he's really yours.
Just think what he can do once we get him a TelePrompTer.
And what’s the deal with bedtime?
I'd like to thank my mom, my dad, and my fingers. I can always count on them.
How cute! His first TED talk!
Phyllis, I'll take that milk now."
Oh, honey!  He says he is resigning to spend more time with his family!
Please welcome, all the way from their bedroom, Mom and Dad!
Be patient! He always saves Twinkle Twinkle for the encore
He’s taking his new baby monitor to the next level.
Oh, honey! He's learned to stand-up all by himself!
Look at Mike stand!
Look - he's a social media prodigy.  We can pre-enroll him in any kindergarten.
How wet IS it?
Okay, that's it: no more Fox News for Kids.
Welcome to this episode of Cribs.  Notice I've replaced my wildlife decor with a transportation theme.
And I thought that stuff only came out of the other end.
I was OK with him looking like your Dad, but I'm not sure how I feel about him singing like your Dad.
Ok, “Mr. President”, it’s time for you to get some rest.
See, I told you.  He's doing it without a teleprompter now!
His first press conference, and he can already say, "I didn't drop that teddy bear. It's not even my kind of teddy bear."
Aw, how cute.  He thinks he can make a difference.
Look, his first TED Talk!
Thanks- I’m here all night.
He said he took one small step for Mom.
Oh look  sweetheart. Baby Donald is pretending to be president again!
He’s got a tight seven minutes, I just hope he can get beyond the potty material.
Look, dear, he's an anchor baby!
Watch! This time he'll do it without the teleprompter!
See? I told you he could stand up!
Why are there modes of transportation hanging above my bed? It’s like, I just got here, and my parents are already telling me to leave.
I'm more worried about where he got the microphone.
He's taking this monitor camera a little too seriously.
I couldn’t have done it without my mother
I’d like to thank my parents for coming.
Welcome to my crib.
Well, there is a precedent for a baby president...
Let's make this nursery great again.
This next one goes out to a very special lady . . .
This place has a two-boob minimum.
Ok, Folks--that's my bedtime!
He a better speaker than our president.
His first word, YUGE!
Little did they know, Donald’s hands would not develop with the rest of his body.
Honey, don’t you think that that’s a lot of pressure for his first word?
D... Da... Deport Trump!
He's a barely stand-up comedian!
Honey, what else do we need to do to get him into college?
And you said all that George Carlin in the womb was a waste of time!
Move over Chris Matthews.  He just pronounced Mayor Pete's name correctly.
The bedtime routine is my favorite one.
I told him to imagine the audience in diapers.
Honey, Baby Donald just told his first lie!
Be patient, he's doing a sound check."
Ooh, look - he’s getting his flyover!
We're his first hecklers!
I was wondering when he'd standup, but this is something else!
We've done all we can - it's up to social media influences now.
Even if he's not funny, this is way better than sleep training.
His first public apology!
With his crying and whining, he’s got a great future in politics.
Thank you. And goodnight.
He's doing observational comedy at least six months ahead of schedule!
The flyover is good, but he insists on adding tanks to the crib before the press conference.
...and the winner is,Daddy! Daddy gets to change my poopy diaper.
I wanted to get your attention. I just ordered a new crib from Alexa and a new brother from Siri.
Our little boy is such a stable genius!
And watch: for his finale he pulls up the bars and says our borders are now more secure!"
He's headlining at the daycare all next week.
Calm down Rita.  Of course he sounds smarter than the President.
Early campaigning has gotten out of control
Wow, he’s doing stand-up!
He sleeps so much better since he put in the two-drink minimum.
Did you hear that, he just said Pete Buttigieg not Mayor Pete.
Well this is a surprise,audience. Would you like to meet my mom and dad?
If we all stand together these cages will be a thing of the past.
I’d like to thank my mom, my dad, and especially Teddy who could not make it to the stage tonight.
Ask not what your diapers can do for you but rather ask what you can do to your diapers!
I know they say all babies go at their own pace, but I was starting to think he'd NEVER start a podcast.
He's very advanced. Most children don't grasp "plausible deniability' until much later.
I’’ll be here all night!
I prefer his tweets.
So, Mickey Mouse, Winnie-the-Pooh, and Donald Duck walk into a bar . . .
See! He just needed a reason to stand!
Did you hear that, honey?! Our future president just uttered his first little phrase, "No collusion."
I think he may be a stable genius!
He’s been retained by the President as a speech writer!
A better speaker than the baby in the White House
Wow! Honey, it’s the president!! He sounds EXACTLY like him!
This week, my podcast guests will be ... Mom and Dad. Again.
This is what we get for leasing the end of his crib to ABC.
His positions aren't great, but his likeability is off the charts!
Look honey, he no longer needs the telepromter.
Isn’t it wonderful dear? His public speaking is already three grade levels above Trump’s!
Honey, We can retire.
I hope he stops acting like a toddler once he’s president
This time, he's even memorized his crib notes.
He nailed that impression of you.
Oh look, his first public apology.
He’s finally doing stand up on his own.
I think he’s ready to be heckled
So what if it's juvenile, it's still stand-up!
Let's take it all away from him and see if he tweets about us!
Heh, heh, I'm here all night, folks!
I just crawled in from Toledo, and boy are my arms tired.
I think he'll do well in Iowa.
His baby impression is spot on.
He sounds just like his real father.
... and now, with your money, he can be president.
He has the daycare vote locked in.
He's on the preschool debate team.
He has your punchlines.
Oh my God, barely two and already a better orator than the President!!!
Nothing says "Nailed It" like a Teddy Bear drop!
NOW we'll show your sister which grandchild is the star!
I was trying to teach him TO stand up.
I told you we should not have used a sperm bank.
I did it my waaaaaaayyyyyy!
I knew he had a face for radio!
I'm here for the next 2 years."
You were spot on about breastfeeding
The assassination of Vice President Bear by extremists  in the middle eastern section of this house has compelled me to unleash the most powerful mobile-enabled aerial and maritime strikes. We will also have booties on the ground within 72 hours.
Oh, Larry. His first press conference.
He's using the mic! Now all we need is a videographer and a YouTube channel and he's set for college.
No, wait, wait! This is the bit where two parents walk into a bar...
If someone acting like a child can be president, then certainly a real child can
There's our nest egg.
And now, appearing nightly at 3 AM, Mama and Dada.
His proposals for Daycare really ring with authenticity.
Welcome back to my podcast. I've worked with my next guests since the beginning...
If his recording of “I’ve Gotta Be Me” in French and Spanish doesn’t get him into that pre-school, I don’t know what will!
ALL MY BREASTFEEDING PAID OFF!!!
Thank you thank you. Make sure to tip your bottletender on the way out.
What's the deal with Gerber?
Forget the other twelve candidates, i have nothing hidden in my past life
This is good. After stand-up usually comes walking.
And you thought the Sinatra tapes were a waste of time.
So sweet! His first teddy talk!
He already has all the qualities to be President!
You think you hate public speaking? I've literally soiled myself!
Another milestone: his first night of stand up!
Now that he's POTUS trained, we can announce!
I'd like to thank my parents for being there for me these past 10 months.
He's already singing "Send in the Clowns"
Oh, honey! Look! He's standing up!
Look! His first lies.
He's got a gig at the Diaper Room.
He called his teddy bear Hillary.
And that's a wrap from Crib News ... Good Night!
Don't worry, Fred, Little Donald's vocabulary will improve before he's 73.
He's polling just slightly higher than Hickenlooper!
My heart says President, but my mind says stand-up comedian...
I’d like to thank my parents for jumpstarting my career when that video of my home birth went viral.
Thank you! I'll be appearing here every night for the next 1-2 years!
And you didn't want to pay the cover!
When our baby wanted to stand up, I didn't think he'd take it this seriously.
This was what he meant by “Me, stand up!” all this time!
I knew replacing breast milk with whiskey on the rocks was a good idea!
No dear, open binky night is Wednesday.
Listen, honey! How cute! His first words were ‘Hello, hello... Is this damn thing on?’
You have to hear his bit about airplane food.
Look! Billy is doing stand-up!
The rumors I did a booboo are fake news!
Walking can wait. Let him perfect his stand-up, first.
My diaper needs to be changed and it is YUUGE.
My opponent says I pooped my pants... I tell you, it's my opponent who poops his pants!
Just imagine, another Toddler in Chief.
Wewcome to my podcast, where I expwore topics at the intersection of powitics and pop culture.
I’m not saying it because he’s our son. That was “Hey Jude.”
He's more articulate than the president!
My Teddy Talk started promptly at 5AM. She stays. You’re fired!
Ich bin ein pacifier
He looks more like Churchill every day!
He’s a voice for those behind bars!
Oh, look, he's pulled himself up to stand-up comedy!
Tomorrow night, he'll want a tip jar.
First words or not, this is a little over the top.
He's finding his voice!
Pre-K-Pop!
Look, honey! His first stand-up!
Great, honey!! But next time, hold the bear and drop the mic..
He's polling vey well in Iowa
For my next number...3
Our baby is doing his first stand-up!
Oh look, Frank, Baby's about to announce his first word!
His elocution will be better once he gets teeth
Mom, these are the wrong type of bars.
I think it's time to mention I used a performing artist sperm bank.
How can you trust someone with such small hands?
He's a shoo-in for Daycare's Got Talent!
Hey Dudes, welcome to my crib.
Omg! He’s already offering conditional, half-hearted apologies!
Now, if we can only understand what he is saying and why he’s always’s laughing at us ...
Look,he makes no sense...he could be president!
He's pretty good at stand-up, considering he just learned to walk.
I think we get to be on the podcast tomorrow!
If anyone's got any formula, see me 
after the show
He learned to talk months ago but he's just now learning how to say nothing.
I told you it would make him want to stand up!
The latest polls show him leading in Iowa.
Mothers always have great expectations for the first word.
Of course his whole act is potty-mouth — what else does he know about?
His first monologue!
Tell me again why we can’t send him back.
I am a stable genius, free of education and encumbering bias!!!
I'm here all week, try the strained peaches and don't forget to tip your nanny.
I can't believe he's doing stand-up already.
He insisted on the fly over for his Fourth of July speech.
His gibberish is sounding more and more like a presidential acceptance speech.
I can't wait for all the neighbors to hear his first words!
I think he’s about to croon!
We interrupt our broadcast to provide a message from my, misinformed parents.
His rap name is 'Da Baybeez Wettt'.
He does an amazing imitation of the president!
Now that he's doing stand-up, I can't wait for him to learn to talk.
I think he's finally settling into a bedtime routine.
You've been great. I'll be here all week folks.
Now he wants a crowd and some tanks.
I'd like to thank my parents, Arnold and Margaret, and apparently a surrogate named Zoë somewhere.
Look dear, he’s standing up.
That’s one small step for me; one giant leap for my teddy bear...
A minister, a priest, a rabbi, and Goldilocks enter a bar.....
Just think how good he'll be when he can read a teleprompter.
A baby crawls into a bar, tells the bartender he needs a drink to celebrate because his Mom is having a new baby. Bartender says "what was wrong with the old one?"
These jokes are going to get way funnier once he learns how to talk."
I gotta tell you, I get no respect.  No respect.
It's his first one liner.
Thanks for coming out tonight... you've been a great audience.
Obviously I'll be here all week.
I'm glad we agree with his stance on bottle warming.
... But more, much more than this ...
I did it ... my way
Look, honey, he murdered his dissident bear and is consolidating power! The book says that means he's ahead on his milestones.
He said his first word: "Testing"!
In the babysitter’s defense, ‘check Mike’ is easily misconstrued.
With his diaper changed he has a legitimate chance.
Awww..he wants to make our family great again.
At his age it's all potty humor, honey.
Tax cuts for the middle class! Isn't that cute?
I kid, I kid. I really love you two knuckleheads.
Donald is so cute. I don't know what it means but he keeps saying "Make America Great Again"
Thanks, folks. I’ll be here all night.
And what's the deal with Peek-A-Boo?! I mean, get a life right?! Is that what you're pretending to hide from anyways?
I get no respect. When I was born, the doctor slapped my face.
Aww honey! His first politcal speech discussing the intricacies of trickle-down economics.
Look, honey, he just announced his candidacy.  Oh, no, he's going to deport all the Teddy Bears.
Shooting today from my mobile location.
He said "Mama" !
Four score and seven days ago...
But seriously folks, take my parents...please.
‘So, what’s the deal with airline food’
He does really well with the younger crowd.
And you thought he'd never settle on a career path!
The baby book said to expect him to stand up by this age, but I did not expect this.
He’s already performing at a first grade level.
All we need now is a brick wall and a two-drink minimum."
And he's already cancelled the press credentials of that snooty stuffed giraffe from the New York Times!
But he is only asking for a LEGO wall.
How about a round of applause for the folks who made this gig possible?
Look, honey! Junior is about to say his first words without the teleprompter!
More unintelligible rambling like this and he'll be president!
That Heckle Me Elmo doll was a great idea.
Look,honey! Barely potty trained and already he's pretending to declare war on Iran.
I just crawled in from the living room and boy are my arms tired. But seriously folks...
Did you hear the one about the rabbi, the priest, and the babysitter who go into a bar?
Four poops and seven sleeps ago...
Aw, look! He's overcompensating already!
And if I am elected, I promise that you can stay up late, never eat vegetables, and watch all the Paw Patrol you want.
Look! He's taken this whole 'stand-up' thing to a new level.
Told you he didn't really want to be an astronaut.
A lot of you have asked about my skin care routine...
Aren’t you proud, dear? No crib sheet!
I’m so thrilled that he no longer needs his teleprompter!
Once he's out of jail, he can run for president.
That last joke killed at Mommy and Me.
If elected the first I’ll change is my diaper.
Nice try, but nap time is not "fake news".
Did you hear that? He said 'testing!'"
So, what's the deal with baby food?
Today...(today, today), I consider myself (self, self) the luckiest baby (baby, baby) on the face of the earth (earth, earth)!
I'll be here all year.
Look, his first attempt at stand up!
Now...to be successful... he must learn how to aggressively interrupt
the other children.
Especially considering the Feldsteins' Joey didn't perform his first monolog until he was three and a half.
He promises to make his daycare center great again.
His first standup!
Tonight on American Cradle...
Sssh. He's coming to the small loan from his dad part.
It's his first tot cast.
The doctor said he needs more feedback.
Oh dear, he sounds like Celine Dion.
OMG! Junior's first one liner!
Now aren't you glad we let him watch the presidential debates?
He is campaigning for the primaries in 2064.
Meet the parents.
All hands on deck. Teddy bear overboard.
And what’s the deal with baby food ?
Finally, a candidate with a viable platform!
My next number will be number 2
It's funny because he's two.
He says he wants a parade of his toy tanks next time.
Looks like he’s given up on his ventriloquism act and gone solo!
Shhhh! Just listen. “OK, darling, how wet ARE you?’
Look, honey! He can stand up!
I'm so glad we chose Seinfeld for our sperm donor.
Attention. Attention please. Clean up on crib 1”
I feel emboldened when he says, ""We have nothing to fear but what's under the bed and in the closet."
He's going without the teleprompter.
Look, he can stand-up!
I overheard him practicing his speech, and it's clearly more cogent and coherent than anything our President is saying!
Now do you appreciate the rhythm method?
So THAT's why you wanted to call him Mike!
He just announced a bold plan to reduce his attention-deficit!
I just want to give a shout out to whomever might please fetch me my bear.
He's just finishing his TED Talk.
His first Teddy Bear Talk!
The doctor did say he's in the 97th percentile for speech development.
Great ! Now how do we stop it ?
His performance style is surprisingly sophisticated in its simplicity, but somebody should do something about the smell.”
I just knew conceiving him after date night at the Karaoke bar would lead to something
Honey, we've got ourselves a little podcaster!
Well, his first word was "bigly."
Last week I said "Stand up" and now he's got a solid ten minute set down at the Comedy Store.
And he only charges a two-bottle minimum!
Our baby’s gone straight from crawling to stand-up!
Thank you, thank you.....I'll be here all night.
Say what you will about inexperience, but he's definitely outperforming Biden.
This is the only room he can play after saying nap time was a social construct.
The aristocrats!
So what’s the deal with burping?! First the bottom, then the mouth, sometimes the nose..Where’s it all coming from.. no seriously folks.
I think he's about to say his first words!
so both my parents walk into my room right...
I think he's close to saying his first word!
Honey, our baby is about to say his first joke.
Reporting live undercover from day fifty-three of captivity; this is baby Dave, signing off.

Oh honey, his first ted talk
Our progeny's a prodigy!
I promise six-months paid maternity leave!
Thanks folks! I'll be here for the next 40 years!
I think he's ready for Iowa!
He’s so much more himself when he’s off the TelePrompTer, don’t you think?
I know he’s only in time out, but it’s so cute to hear him fight against putting kids in cages.
Oh honey, his first sound check!
Honey...should we worry about early onset of narcissism?
Just knew we did the right thing naming him after my brothers ..... Lenny & Bruce
I guess we'll have a put in a brick accent wall.
He's practicing his Stand-up routine!
He can babble with the best Congress has to offer.
I tell ya, I get no respect.
Hey guys, thanks for watching, don’t forget to like this video, hit the subscribe button, and leave a comment below.
Now hear this. One more spoonful of pureed prunes and there will be hell to pay.
Look honey. We’re making America great again
He already lacks enough intellect to be President of the United States
Oh honey, his first words, "Ladies and Gentlemen".
My parade will have tanks.
And look honey, he doesn't even need to rely on crib notes!
Who thought that ADHD could have such an upside?
He already has 500 followers from his first podcast!

His first false campaign promise!
Honey! Did you hear that?! Our baby’s a liberal!
I prefer his older material.
Well you did say no to a wireless baby monitor.
He's going to make daycare great again, isn't he?
How could he have already lobbied, leveraged, and lied so much?
Mr. Dada, tear down this wall.
He can not only stand up, he can DO stand-up!!
Funny. But must our sex life be part of his routine?
Honey, she owns the 0 to 12 months demographic!
He believes that he is the big Baby that floats in the sky.
Last week potty trained, and now this !
Honey!, his first monologue!
He supports social security!
Fred, he's lying already and can't even vote yet!

Bet you $10 that his first words will be, "My fellow Americans"!
Now, how about a big hand for my parents, Maggie and Bill
Clean up to crib aisle.
We probably should have taught him to speak before we gave him the microphone.
Honey! He just said his first fake news!
We are adding “babbled to Mozart at 6 months” to his preschool application!
He's taping his latest TEDdy Bear Talk: Tots Behind Bars -- End the Injustice.
And what's with that plastic nipple they want me to suck on? Gross!
Look, Dear. He's babbling gibberish into the microphone we got him. He'll make a fine politician someday.
How exciting! He's spoken his first lie.
Why not?!  It’s really true, anyone can be president.
In eighteen years these bars might be higher.... am I right... am I right?
Just six months old, and he’s already pandering!!!
Aren’t you thrilled? We’re recording his first YouTube video.
Now all we have to do is traumatize him for 20 years.
He just told his first lie!
Listen,dear,  she’s practicing her TEDDY  TALK!
He's going after the youth vote.
I love it when he raps about his crib
In the year 2079, I will be the same age as the current president. Can I count on your vote?
You see Dear....I TOLD you leaving Fox News on all day wouldn't do any harm.
Not even crawling yet and already doing standup comedy!
At least someone doesn't have performance anxiety.
Look, Harold! It’s his very first Open Crib night!
Choose me, and we'll reach for the things that hang from the ceiling.
I’m so proud of him.  He’s polling ahead of Bernie Sanders after the last debate.
He's right, diaper rash is an issue that politicians have been ignoring for far too long.
... and when I'm elected, I will create a Space Force.
The 2052  Primaries will be here before we know it.
Just think, maybe some day we'll be the proud parents of someone that no parent will want their daughter to be listening to.
Only 14 months and he’s already abandoned prop comedy for observational humor!
In that moment,Dad realized he would spend a lifetime being one of two audience members in attendance at his son's poetry readings.
Just be yourself if you get upset during the debate, throw a tantrum and name calling.
We can burp him after he finishes his podcast.
His lack of vocabulary and wisdom hasn't at all prevented him from gaining political popularity.
We should have been more careful in selecting a sperm donor.
And what's the deal with those immunizations?  Does anyone even know what a Rubella is?

Trump really seems to like his new office!
He's standing now, but in 2020 he could run!

Our retirement is starting to shape up.
Now do you believe me about what happened in that dressing room at Bergdorf’s?

The doctor says he's in the 95th percentile for rhetoric!
So much for the baby monitor!
Who do I have to bite to get a diaper around here?

Imagine, stand-up before he's even walking!
Mom, Dad ... This is your life!

You’ve been a wonderful audience, stick around for my second act once I get my diaper changed!
Lenny, don't say "but seriously folks" unless it really is serious.
Look Honey!  Isn't he just electable?"
Don’t you think it’s tome we had a toddler for president and not an infant?
...and that’s why I believe I would make an excellent Presidential candidate.”
I  thought he was only learning to stand up.
We’re so blessed to have a baby who sings himself to sleep.
It'll be an issue if he drops the mike.
I think we may not need that college education fund at all.
How do you turn this on?
Who figured he could do stand-up before he could crawl?
This daycare for politicians is worth every penny!
His agent says he has a great crib presence.
No one is looking out for the little guy, so that’s why I’m announcing my candidacy for the Democratic Nominee.
Just yesterday he was crawling. Today he’s doing stand-up.
Don't you see?! Starting his showbiz career now means he'll be out of rehab by the time he reaches first grade!
Early polls have him in the lead.
I'd like to announce my candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 election.
It is kind of scary that his first words were "My Fellow Americans."
One small step for a man - one enormous step for a baby.
He just threw his teddy in the ring, he's running for President.
I told you listening to This American Life in utero would pay off.
What a genius. Soon he'll be able to afford his own crib.
Look honey, his first podcast!
Susan, I'm not sure you should have binge-watched "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" while you were pregnant.
What don't you get about "I need my diaper changed?"

He performed the sound check all by himself.
Shh. He's about to say his first word.
It's so nice he has moved on to Roosevelt! Lincoln's gettysburg was getting a little too familiar.....
Is this what they meant when they said there would be Late Nights?
He said he will colonize Mars, end all war, and balance the budget as soon as we change his diaper.
I think he's ready for his first TED talk!
Look honey, I gave birth to a Congressman!
Live! from New York, its Saturday Night!
Finally! A platform to communicate with Republicans!
He's so smart he's not even using crib notes.
I think he's about to announce his choice of sexual identity!
My mom said I should move onto solids. I said, don't do yourself down, they're still pretty firm
Just think: as soon as he is potty trained he will be running for office!
He has your idiot savantness.
I've already trademarked "Justin Bébé!"
That's okay, I haven't heard of me either.
Just think what he'll sound like when he learns words, honey!

I felt the bit about watching us have sex was kind of unnecessary.
He already has five thousand followers.
His eating mud bit always kills.
He's debating his teddy bear about when bedtime should be. Our little future president.

RODNEY DANGERFIELD; 
The Early Years
"I TELL YA... 
I DON'T GET NO WEESPECT!"
Honey! It's his very first conspiracy rant!
He's doing stand-up before he can stand up!
I get no respect at all. In preschool I share a locker with a broom.
See, he's mastered stand-up!
I just love it when he says,"My fellow Americans."
He told his first lie!
The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge....It rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do …
When you said baby rap I thought you meant a blanket.

He's telling a lot of  "mama" jokes
Well the delivery was awful, but the vocals are terrific !
Take my parents - - please!
Yo momma is so dumb, she didn’t realize Bert and Ernie were lovers.
He gets it from me.
Now aren't you glad we named him Mike?
A Presidential contender!
I told you he was going to be the voice of his generation !
From infancy to candidacy. I told you he's gifted.
I knew we were right to name him Mike.
Finally - his first words!  "No comment"
Wow, we really nailed it by naming him DJ!
So I says, sleep? SLEEP?! Talk to me in 18 years!
It's America's Next Top Toddler.
Perfect timing... for my next song I’d like to sing “Born in the USA”.
I'd book him a nightclub gig, but it would be way past his bedtime.
Is it too soon to bring him to the FOX News Broadcast Center?
Yes, it’s true I’m afraid. My understanding of the world, human history and relations and even economics is immeasurably more sophisticated, comprehensive and nuanced than the ethically bereft fraud that somehow got elected by you. 
...bottle please
Which do you think it will be? Mamma or Dadda?
I think the President will love his new spokesman!
Now that Daddy’s home, tell Mommy again what you saw Daddy doing with the Nanny.
I'm so glad we got that karaoke machine.
I'm more of a boob man, myself.
Aspiring to be a day time host would have been so much easier.
It works, but not as well as your poop jokes.
He's about to announce which college team he'll play for.
...and now, a few words from the newest Democratic Presidential nominee!
Tell you what: I'll take milk from Mommy's breast over the stewed peaches from a plastic spoon any day! And have you tried the mashed peas?!
Look honey!  He’s standing up.
Why don't you listen to me, tear down this wall
He hasn't even crawled and he's already doing stand-up!
He’s going to make kindergarten great again.
Definitely presidential material
Our boy got enough new donors to be a part of the next Democratic debate!
I am so proud, Dear. It's his first live podcast!
First of all, I'd like to thank my parents; without whom I wouln't be here.
Baby monitors are so 2009
Oh, look honey, his first stand up."
Look Howard, he's a stable genius.
Just think how much better he'll sound when he can actually talk.
Two babies walk into a bar....
His first attempt at stand up.
I just hope he isn't still breastfeeding by the time he starts doing interviews.
I ain't nothing but a hound dog, cryin' all the time.
Look, honey! He’s playing Democratic debate again.
And here they are! Two of my most fantastic supporters, and I gotta tell you the truth, they are extraordinary, beautiful, really great people to who we all owe tons of gratitude...

Yes, I'm sure he said 'Lock her up'!
Ever notice how parents get all stupid and excited whenever they see you standing up on your own? It's enough to make you wanna vomit...again.  Huh? Am I right, infants? Am I right?
See, give him a microphone and his insecurities disappear .  He could grow up to be President!
Look honey, he's got your father's incoherent grandstanding genes!
He distinctly said DaDa. Our boy is an art critic!
I’d like to thank you Mom and Dad.
You’ve been a great audience. I’ll be appearing here at ‘The Crib’ tomorrow night at the same time. By the way, a stool with a bottle of water would be appreciated. My name’s Dickie and good night.
That microphone is a much better long-term investment than any of those baby monitors.
When I say come and get me I mean COME GET ME!
It's perfect. Now when he can't sleep he can podcast.
Isn't it amazing?  He's the President's new speechwriter.
It's not too early for him to declare his candidacy for 2056.
To represent the youth vote- Today I am announcing my canidateship for the President of America; now will someone change me.
Oh honey, I smell a sitcom!
I can‘t wait until he starts talking so we can find out what political party he represents!
Tap Tap. “Mama. Dadda. Poop.”
I  know his jokes are scatological,
but I think he's really funny!
Awww See? He said Grab em in the pussy! Just like our President! - said no parent ever
Isn't this wonderful, dear? He just spoke his first truthful words.

I want to wake up in that city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap
I heard him!  "One giant poop for mankind!"
He says “dropped baby” jokes are derivative.
This is so much better than a baby monitor
It's time to pass the torch to a new generation!
He already looks presidential.
I still think he’s got a better chance than O’Rourke.
Oh honey, look! It’s baby’s first podcast!
He's got your lack of talent.
Listen honey, he sounds just like the president.
I love how he never plays down to his audience.
Doesn't he look so presidential?
He's never been in a closet.  How can he announce that he is coming out?
He’s funny, but it’s your turn to change him”.
And for my next act I'm going to go to bed.
Honey, he's gone viral! Well have you called the doctor?
It's not unusual to be loved by everyone.
We finally have a retirement plan!
I am Mommy's Bundle of Joy, and I endorse this message.
Finally, a candidate with a clean background.
He's against my reproductive rights.
So the sperm donor was a standup comic after-all!
Sure he sounds childish to us, but there are a lot of people who think he's brilliant.
Now he just needs three recommendation letters  for that preschool interview.
I love the part when he drops the mike and says 'bambino out!'
The wheels on the bus go round and round... until it doesn’t. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
Andrew, honey, let’s show Daddy how we deal with hecklers!

He's practicing to be the White House press secretary.
How cute, he’s practicing his inauguration speech .

Oh look, he's announcing for the Democratic nomination!
Thanks, I'll be here all week. And next week. And...
How do we get a stand up to settle down?
His demographic is pretty much cradle to grave.
look, we are raising a politician!
OK, I have time for one last question.
It’s part of his bedtime routine
So what's the deal with baby mobiles? They don't seem to be going anywhere!

Never before has the Mall seen such a patriotic display. I alone can save the country. God bless Me.

Here comes the best part, where he says, 'Tip your waitwess!'
As long as he doesnt start singing 'Yesterday'
The crib was a gift from Uncle Putin
For just a second, I thought it was Trump with a broken teleprompter...

Oh Fred! It's his first State of the Nursery!

It’s confirmed. Audrey’s “America’s Got Talent Prenatal” app, may, indeed pay off
I hope his passion for the arts doesn’t mean he will live with us forever.
Hopefully it's about the embargo on strained peas.
Thanks folks.  I’’m here all week...before bedtime.
He's funny, but his riff on breast feeding crosses the line I think"..
I think he took “Stand up Mike...” a bit too far.
He sounds even better live.
His material in these late night sets are edgier, but his breast feeding bit is priceless!
Oh look, he's starting to generate his first content!
I think he's going to be a politician.  He says he wants to make his nursery great again.

He's all talk, no play!
Mama. Mama. Maga.
Today, the moon. Tomorrow, The Price is Right.
Trumps first babble.
Oh Carl! Baby’s first honorarium!
Today I announce my candidacy for President of the United States 2060, assuming Trump has been impeached then.
Isn’t he cute in his little bully playpen?
He’s announcing his Democratic  Presidential  candidacy!
Thanks, folks! I’ll be here all eighteen years.
His first cover!
I can't wait to see him drop the mic.
She’ll be stumping any day now.
Tell the “I don’t get no respect” joke again, Rodney.
Look, honey! He's doing stand-up on his own!
Oh Honey, look - he started his own podcast entitled 
"Eat, Sleep, Poop."
Babies don't usually stand-up this young!
I told you it'd be worth the extra thousand for Chuck Schumer's sperm!
He said, "Take my parents...please!".
Look, he's standing up!
His first speech without a crib sheet.
And a big shout out to the sperm donor.”
He’s doing standup!
Larry, his first words were, “Take my father, ...please”
Oh, Honey! His very first campaign speech!
I like all his songs, but his rendition of The Itsy Bitsy Spider is my favorite.
Never mind. He just keeps repeating, 'Pass the torch!'
Indeed, he exhibits exceptional stump precocity, but I wish his vocabulary were broader than "Lock her up!".
Where should we mount the spotlight?
I swear it sounds like first words were Lady Gaga.
Not looking forward to our arguments about career choice in 10 years.
There’s no business like poop business laaa lala
I told you "Fly Me to the Moon" was not a suitable choice for a lullaby!
Look! His first stand up, standing up!
Look! He's started his own podcast!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Maybe we should stop this before he turns into a politician.
Electability is an issue- he’s polling in the terrible twos.
Don't tell me he's demanding a wall........
Oh look!  They're filming "Back to the Future, Trump Edition."
Oh, Frank!  He just made his first stump speech!
Honey, get the camera! It's his first apology speech!
At least if he whips "his" dick out they'll be no media backlash.
I'd tell him not to quit his day job, but he's two.
He's really making the most of his platform
Stand up is so much more advanced than improv!
By installing a full studio, instead of just a baby monitor, he'll be an influencer before he's five years old!
Look Honey, it's his first stand up!
And just today he delivered his very first punch line!
I dare you to name one other candidate with his spotless record!
Sure we want to change his bedtime hour, but I'm so proud of his first filibuster.
Senator, As you can see, I've been looking at transportation my whole life. There, I am an expert. But I have failed completely in the preservation of the stuffed Kodiak bear. I just can't reach it. I step down from this committee assignment.
He live streamed momma.
Wait till you hear his bit on universal pre-k for all babies.
Let's teach him to moonwalk!
I think he just announced that he is running in the Democratic primaries in 2060.
Look, dear, he's doing stand-up.
Ha ha! And he doesn't even talk!
Kevin, look!  He's podcasting!
Well you wanted to call him Mike.
He just announced he's running for President!
Look honey, he'll soon be telling lies just as easily as our politicians.
He just announced he's running for president in 2040!
Yes, but can he reach across the crib?
Don’t you dare heckle him!
Thank you. I'll be here all week.
Well, folks, that’s my time. Remember to tip your babysitters and parents.
Because 'Mama' in surround sound just sounds better.
A tune only a mother has ears for
His first words were "Take my Mother, please."
Look Thomas, he's already pandering at a three-year old level!
His first campaign promise!
Please welcome my next guests... Mommy and Daddy!
I have something to say about how things are run here...
And, finally, the 5th amendment should be broadened to include babbling..
I knew the mic would get him to talk!  He’ going to be a politician.
We'll  hear his first word from anywhere in the house!
This is my first time doing my comedy standing up.
Tune in tomorrow for my rendition of  'H' through 'P' .
He told everyone I'm his favorite mother!
We can monetize this baby!
He just said that there are at least 300 people in the room.
He's a democrat!
Oh, honey, look! His first podcast!
Get the camera, he's about to drop his first mic!
I didn't expect him to be talking so soon, I hope he doesn't grow up to be a politician!
Did you hear our boy, honey? He said, "I'm here 'til Thursday; try the veal."
His first policy regurgitation!
Crying got our attention too.
Take my binky... please.
we were so right to name him "Winston!"
He doesn't identify with a particular religion, gender, sexual orientation or race, he's perfect.
Can you believe it? He's already learned the seven words!
He spoke his first lie!
Jim, he's gone from coo to coup and overthrown Teddy!
Oh Honey! Isn't he wonderful? And just wait till he learns a word or two.
He said his first tweet!
His first word is about to go viral!”
Ba da boom, ba da bing.
Oh, look, dear!  It's his first live pod-cast!
Look! His first press conference.
This week on bed time FM
I’ll be talking about leaveraging your parents for more awake time by using the potty and Alec Baldwin is back for another great segment on how to park in New York while avoiding jail”
he's doing Stand Up before he can actually Stand Up
Mom. Dad. It seemed like the baby monitor wasn't working. I need my teddy.
Wait a moment! Our president is addressing the nation
Sing that one about the little star again! I think it could be a hit.
He's the president's choice for the next Secretary of Defense.
Do you think we should pull the plug?  Suppose he turns out like Donald Trump.
He has a plan for government-run potty training.
I told you he had a face for radio!
Now tell mommy you love her, real loud!
Ground control to Major Tom...
Now I know for sure he's not mine.
We can pay off the mortgage!!
Thank you, thank you. I'll be here for the next 20 years.
Be gentle.  He just let his agent go.
In a British Accent: The vaccines made our son artistic! He's already doing stand up.
Oh, look honey! He's assassinated his Teddy and declared a coup over all the crib's creatures.
I would like to pay tribute to our wonderful Armed Forces.
To think, he could be an autocrat one day with 
his very own military-themed celebration.
Look honey! In just a few years he'll be inappropriately touching women too!
Pass the baton!
I can’t believe Trump is listening to everything he says.
I'm so glad we named him Mike!
Would you look at that, Sue? He’s finally learned to stand-up by himself!
Oh, Darling, I see millions in our future.
And he’s awake at 5am every day to send his tweets
Oh honey, the debate team will look so good on his college application!
He was so smart to pick Stuffed Animals for a jillion dollars!
Sing 'Melancholy Baby.'
He's announcing that he's running for the Democratic nomination for President!
Hello my baby, hello my darlin'
And the meaning of life is...
Welcome. I have decided to wake up.
Addressing the infantry.
Oh, Look Darling, He's practicing so hard to "Make America Great Again!"
Thank you! I'll be here for the next 92 years.
He's selling himself as the opposite of Trump.
It’s so much better than his crawl up routine.
He isn't even potty-mouth trained!
As depicted in my mobile is the Revolutionary Air Force,key to Washington's Army's control of the air over the Colonies.
So that's what he traded his iPhone for.
Say something Mommy can hashtag.
He's the first one at day care who can pull-up AND do stand-up.
He’s ready for FOX NEWS.
Nah, but really folks I come from a very loving home. My parents are actually in the crowd tonight. Give it up for Joan and Steven you guys!
So my mother still thinks I want to be an astronaut...more like astro-NOT! I’m here all night, folks.
I know it’s low brow but that booger bit kills.
Isn't that cute, he wants to make America great  again?
I love his mother-in-law material
Mommy's little influencer already has a million followers!
Isn't that sweet?  His first press conference!
American toys for American boys! Send “Made in China”  back to China! 
Accept no substitutions! If  parents say “Relax” tell them our generation aims to make America Great Again! And one last thing, kiddos, stay away from Kale. Stunts your growth.
Look, honey, it's his first night of stand-up.
You were the one who told him he could grow up to be President!
Does he come with his own agent?
"Wait.He's smarter than  the   both  of  us."
Honey, I think little Billy believes he can actually run in the 2020 election
My first word: My!
He's growing up so fast, today he's doing stand-up!
OMG..........He sounds Presidential......
Not Manilow!
They said he was a sure thing based on the lack of a voting history.
Aw, baby’s first podcast.
Union suit. Union kid. Told ya we didn’t have to worry.
...so I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.
Be sure to tip your nannies, mommies and daddies - I'll be here for the next 18 years !
Use your words.
And he speaks without a teleprompter
OH JOHN,  WE'RE GOING TO BE RICH!
How cute!  Look how well he spins how Teddy was collateral damage to his crib mobile defense assets.
Imprisoned, we have nothing to lose but the bars of our cribs. Ignore your mobiles, cast out those traitorous Teddy Bears. We have a world to win!
I say we plug it in and surprise the neighbors...
He knows words. He has the best words.
I know, right? No one sitting up front.
We've created a monster!
And another math geniues and mind-blowingly gifted child of mediocre-iq-parents was born.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!
Look, honey.  He just made his first podcast!
Hey!!!  There weren't any airports during the Revolutionary War!!!  Mom... Dad... Have you been messing with my teleprompter again?!?!
Not bad for wah-wah music, honey.
How long before he can do Carpool Karaoke?
Did you hear that, honey? He wants us to tear down his wall!
You’re fired!
Maybe we shouldn’t have called him Elton.
Do you think he's ready for a Twitter account?
We never should have taken him to that presidential rally.
I’m so proud! He finally tossed his rattle into the ring!
And to think he got started with just a baby cam!
I see him doing stand-up three times a night and living with us.
Wow, John, call Nancy Pelosi. I think we've got the perfect person to beat Trump.
PLEASE NOTE:
You sendtus the July issue and we didn’t get it until July 1st.  Which makes it very difficult for me to submit my caption to the “Dragon” cartoon by June 30, 19.  It is:
“ She is still upset about you burning her hair off last time”
Oh Harry, Nipper's first obscene word!
I'd like to dedicate this next wail to my babysitter, Tiffany.
Look, dear, he's campaigning for 2052!
...and the nominees for "parents of the year" prize are...
Screaming in the middle of the night just got a whole lot easier

His first words - a shout-out to his mother!
His tax plan sounds better than any of the others.
Mom I know you want me to take one small step for ​man but I just want out of this crib!
The teleprompter says, "I'm fine, go back to sleep, Mom and Dad."
Pretty soon we're going to need Baby's First Teleprompter.

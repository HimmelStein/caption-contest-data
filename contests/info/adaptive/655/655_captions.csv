How do you respond to allegations that you're bipolar?
The poles show you’re in trouble.
I'm sure voters have noticed that you're completely in the dark half the time.
Ask yourself, are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?
I guarantee in twelve hours we'll see a completely different side of my opponent.
Oh, sure. But in 12 hours, you'll take the opposite position.
My opponent, on the other hand, tends to be all over the map.
That wasn’t your position this morning.
I guarantee in twelve hours my opponent will be on the other side of the issue.
Ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4.54 billion years ago?
Spin. Spin. Spin. That's all we ever get from you.
There you go again; constantly changing your position"
Wait, if you're here, then where are we?
Everything doesn’t revolve around you, you know!
Spin and more spin!  That's all we get from you.
And yet just a few hours ago you held a totally different position!
And finally, can you really trust my opponent whose position changes EVERY SINGLE DAY?
No offense, but half the time , you’re in the dark!
Please let me finish. Not everything revolves around you!
Clearly Russia is behind you!
I know for a fact Russia is behind this.
Twelve hours from now my opponent will do a complete about-face.
Don't be fooled by her 4.5 billion years of experience.
We've had enough of your spin.
In the past 12 hours, my opponent has made a complete about-face.
Spin! All we get from you is spin!
My opponent changes his position every day
All my opponent ever does is spin, spin, spin.”
Folks, we need stability—not a revolution every 24 hours.
Really? You held the exact opposite position just six months ago!
With all due respect, I am the one with the degree in global studies.
And can we trust a candidate that does a 180 twice a day?
Oh, I get it - the whole world's right and I'm wrong.
Make no mistake—in just half a day his position will have changed 180 degrees!
I don't care how many millions of years it took. Your 5 minutes are up.
Wait... If you're here then where am I?
My opponent’s position changes every day!
You are bipolar and tempestuous.
Even your own poles show you losing.
If you're here then what am I standing on?
I've got many, many continents. More continents than you can even imagine. The best continents.
Rest assured, by the time this debate is over, my opponent will have changed positions yet again.
Spin, spin and more spin!  Stop that!
Unfortunately, Wind and Fire will be unable to join us tonight.
And another thing, you think the sun rises and sets around you!
My opponent believes the sun rises and sets on her.
Are you better off than you were four billion years ago?
Just in the last day, my opponent has rotated 360 degrees.
The only thing we have to fear is sphere itself.
You're in trouble at the poles!
Yes, but can you act locally?
Just as we seemed to finding some common ground, you rotate right back to the same position you held 24 hours ago!
Don't be intimidated by the gravity of my opponent.
There you go again, thinking everything revolves around you!
First you spend millions of years making fossil fuels, now you say we can't use them?
Please let me finish. Your last turn felt like it took all day.
Look, if you are who you say you are then what am I standing on?
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is me against the world.
Not quite. But you're getting warmer.
Nothing but spin.
There you go again, promising the moon.
Unlike my opponent, I don’t believe everything revolves around me.
Are we really considering electing someone who will be over five billion years old at the time they take office?
It's all spin.
It’s always about you, isn’t it?
This debate doesn't revolve around you.
My opponent relies too heavily on poles.
Enough with the spin.
She keeps going around and around and never gets to her point.
Half of each and every day, my opponent is operating in the dark.
My opponent here is a master of spin.
As always, my opponent is going around in circles.
My opponent spins everything.
I knew Venus. Venus was a friend of mine. And you, sir, are no Venus.
My opponent has been spinning in circles. If we follow her we'll just end up in the same spot next year!
It is almost impossible to overstate the gravity of my opponent’s position.
If elected, I will build a great, great wall and Mars will pay for it.
Save the Earth? Now who's the narcissist?
No!  I say that you have been given too much latitude already!
A stay-at-home mom for 4 1/2 billion years with no managerial expertise...
As you can see, my opponent is completely off his axis!
What makes you an expert on climate change?
I'm afraid your time's almost up.
It is common knowledge that my opponent is a master of spin
I think you need a latitude adjustment.
That wasn’t your position six months ago!
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation!
You can spin all you want
Our next auction item, one used and abused planet. A real fixer upper, but with lots of potential.
Could you be more Pacific?!
The earth has an announcement to make: it's bi-polar.
And the moon is gonna pay for it.
Yes, my opponent may be worldly, but he also has a dark side.
Well, I'm just warming up, too.
Is my opponent going to reach a point or continue to go around in circles?
Furthermore, Fox just broke the story that you weren't even born in our solar system!
So, if you are here, what are we all standing on?
As you can see the world is very big. Huge. Really huge. And there is a lot of water. Very wet water.
Proving, once again, it's me against the world.
And yet my opponent refuses to share her earth certificate!
It appears my opponent is getting heated.
I will concede that my opponent may have more gravitas.
I've seen Jupiter, sir. And you're no Jupiter.
I catch your continental drift.
Yeah, and I guess you think the sun revolves around you!
You don't look so hot to me.
The Flat Earth Society welcomes a very controversial speaker tonight...
It isn't fair. You've been warming up for a while.
 I'm just getting started.
My opponent seems to think the world of himself
You just have to put a spin on everything, don't you?
My opponent is only showing half of the picture!
I would ask my opponent to please refrain from finishing every argument with "the world has spoken".
My opponent is a disaster waiting to happen.
Do you even understand the gravity of this situation?
In general, we at the Flat Earth Society do not lend much credibility to physical evidence.
Could you be a bit more Pacific?
No doubt my opponent will defend globalism.
Wait... if you're here, then what planet am I on?
Can you be a bit more Pacific?
Please, stop saying "I think I 'm speaking for all of us..."
You think everything revolves around you.
My opponent, clearly, thinks the world of himself.
I will concede that my opponent speaks with exceptional gravity.
Can I finish my point? You had 4.5 billion years to make yours.
And what makes YOU an expert on climate change?
Wait ... if you’re there, where am I?
OK, so maybe when I said I would "take on the world" I overpromised.
Global warming, world peace, global poverty"...For my opponent it's always, "Me, me, me!
I'm for the voters while my opponent is for self-preservation.
That's your best argument?  You have 4.5 billion years of life experience over me?
And you, sir, are no Mars.
I knew planet Earth, you sir are no planet Earth.
When I said I’m willing to take on the whole world, it was a metaphor!
Why does it always feel like it's me against the world?
Are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?
No, I'm the one who's just warming up.
Doug mansplains climate change to Mother Earth
You're clearly out of your orbit.
And now, someone who needs no introduction.
So after Atlas shrugged, what happened?
Sure, my opponent claims she can provide clean air, clean water, enough food for everyone - but how is she going to pay for it?
Well, it looks like the whole world is against me.
That's not exactly what I meant, but you're getting warmer.
I give facts and all you get from her is spin.
My opponant can spin as much as he likes but we all know that in 24 hours he will return to exactly the same position. Just admit it sir; you are a globalist!
In case you haven't heard--you are not the center of the universe.
You're constantly shifting your position.
Stop spinning and give me a straight answer!
I knew Jupiter; I was a friend of Jupiter, and sir, you are no Jupiter.
I would suggest to you that you are taking these climate change debates far too personally
If you're here, then where are we?
My opponent is ignoring the gravity of this situation.
Oh, believe me. I'm just warming up, too!
Once again, my opponent proves the master of spin.
So I guess it's me against the world.
And what makes you the expert on global warming?
Please give a not-so-warm welcome to our next guest.
Just cool down.
Oh, sure...next you'll be saying you speak for everyone.
What if I’m right and the whole world IS wrong?
My opponent is a known environmental extremist.
Well, I guess it's me against the world, then!
You see, the whole world is against me.
My opponent is a master at spinning.
The earth was captured by the sun.  I like planets that were not captured by the sun!
It's me against the world.
My opponent, however, leans twenty three and a half degrees to the left but six months later will do exactly the opposire!
All my opponent does is spin.
My opponent seems to think the sun rises and sets on her alone!
Volatile. Windy. Erupting. Stormy. These are all words commonly used to describe my opponent.
There you go again... Spin. Spin. Spin.
Please - you've had 5 billion years; you can wait another 30 seconds.
My opponent is all over the map.
I can see Alaska from here!
Let me finish...you've had 4.5 billion years; it's my turn to talk.
You thought you were too big to fail.
My opponent obviously thinks the world of himself.
Looks like it’s me against the world.
There you go again, always spinning things!
Who cares what the world thinks!
Sir, could you be more pacific?
You need to cool down before we continue.
Is it warm in here or is it just you?
Point to where the orange man hurt you.
My opponent thinks everything revolves around her.
And our next expert on climate change needs no introduction...
Nothing but spin, folks!
You too have faults.
And now, introducing my special guest for Earth Day...
You clearly fail to understand the gravity of the situation.
Would I be running for reelection if I cared what the world thinks?
The universe does not revolve around you!
Enough about your problems.
With all due respect, the people are getting sick of your constant spin.
This is America! Who cares what the world thinks.
You always have to turn everything into a global issue, don’t you?
What can you say when the whole world is against you?
It's indisputable that my opponent likes to "spin".
May I present, the leading authority on climate change.
You're not too big to fail.
I don't care how many revolutions you've started. You have to wait your turn.
I don't care for my opponent's spin.
And our next Earth Day speaker needs no introduction.
Are you going to answer the question, or just keep spinning?
My opponent has 'flatly refused' and now he 'roundly condemns' - well, which is it?
I know you’re just warming up
So if YOU'RE here, then what planet am I on?
Must you put a spin on everything?
My opponent’s arguments are just all over the map.
My five minutes are up. I'm sure my opponent could go on for ages.
Must you spin everything?
You're just mad because you're melting in the polls.
There you go again, always promising the moon!
Our next speaker will share a more global perspective.
What on earth are you talking about?
I don't think my opponent appreciates the gravity of the situation.
And now, for a global perspective.
And to my left, the Democratic candidates for President of the United States.
I guess it really is me against the world.
And how do you feel about Europe and Asia talking behind your back?
Stop! It's all just spin!
... and I assert that the only reason you support the idea of global warming is your own self interest.
Stop spinning everything.
What my opponent fails to mention is that I WILL build a wall. And Mars will pay for it!
Why is it always me against the world?!
You claim to think globally, but can we afford to have a president who is bipolar?
You say you want a revolution?
My opponent can't even give us a straight answer about their age. Are you 5,779 or 4.5 billion years old?
I suppose it really is "me against the world"!
Voters want the truth but you just spin.
MEDICS! Something just fell on our president!
71% of my opponent's surface is covered with water. He is practically all wet. He is 4.54 billion years old! He takes 24 hours to rotate on his axis! Let's not even mention the gaping hole in his ozone layer. vote for me.
I too, am just warming up!
I believe your time is almost up
My opponent would have you believe that a crisis is looming...
If you're here, what are we standing on?
Next thing you’re going to say is that WE are to blame for your problems.
Despite our differences, I can certainly appreciate your uniquely global perspective.”
Our next presenter has tremendous gravitas.
My opponent represents everything that is wrong with the world today.
Enough spin!
My opponent will promise you the moon.
Just when the debate started to get interesting, Atlas shrugged.
What makes you think you can speak for the whole world?
And now for a global perspective on tonight's topic...
I told you I’m not paranoid..the world IS against me
I think we've all had about enough of your spin.
I'm hot and gassy too and I don't blame YOU for it.
My sincere apologies to our next presenter, but, it seems, we have run out of time.
Of course my opponent promises you the world. But does he have anything else to offer?
No, only most of the stage is a world.
My opponent's views on global climate change are clearly self-serving.
I knew Jupiter. And you’re no Jupiter.
The World speaks for itself. The question is whether anyone is listening.
``You're hot? Well my feet hurt. Now answer the question.''
Being 4.6 Billion years old doesn't make you an expert in everything!
This is big, no matter how you spin it.
I would like to urge my distinguished opponent to cool down.
I'm afraid your time is up.
Respectfully, you don't speak for everyone.
Quit with the spin!
I said "you're flat" not "fat".
I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's age or rising core temperature.
I feel like the whole world is against me here.
My opponent expects everything to revolve around him.
Spin, spin, spin, that’s all you do!
First let me say that I think the world of my opponent.
Too big to fail? Tell that to Venus.
My opponent is clearly off his axis.
is it warm in here, or is that just you
I'd like to ask my opponent what *really* happened to the dinosaurs?
To begin - I just want to say, I think the world of my opponent.
Some days, it feels like the whole world is against me.
Yet again, it’s me against the world.
I am NOT paranoid! Why is the whole world against me?
And now, straight from its world tour around the sun...
My opponent seems to disregard the gravity of the situation!
My opponent is all over the place.
I’ve got moons, lots of moons; the BEST moons.
My opponent is going to promise you the world.
My turn! Your 5 billion years are up.
I don't think you realize the gravity of this situation.
I keep telling my shrink I am not paranoid, the whole world is against me.
I feel like the whole world is against me.
And of course my opponent will claim to be more worldly.
I have an axis to grind with you.
Get to the point. I don't have 7.5 billion years.
This feels like it’s me against the world.
Yes, but act local.
My opponent puts a spin on everything.
Same old spin!
Excuse me, this is a no spin zone.
My opponent is just spinning around in circles!
You sir, are no sun.
Who in the world do you think you are?
See you in twenty-four hours.
Accepting the award for Al Gore is...earth"
We keep going round and round on this issue...
It’s always me against the world!
Just more spin from my opponent.
I’d like to thank everyone for being with us this evening.
Unlike my opponent, I am not a globalist.
I, on the other hand, prefer to think locally.
Oh, now you’re the expert on climate change?
Please excuse the methane release.
Don't you turn your Pacific at me! I'm talking to you!
Who are you going to believe? Me, or the rest of the world?
I appreciate your global perspective, however...….
My opponent would like you to believe she can be all things to all people.
Have you ever felt like the whole world’s against you?
With all due respect, those comments reflect an incredibly biased world view.
My opponent makes every issue a global issue.
You sir are not too big to fail.
It's no surprise that my opponent hides his most polarizing features.
Again, it’s me against the world.
I'll let the world speak for itself.
In closing let me point out that my opponent has been involved for at least 10,000 years in wars, genocide, famine, corruption, hurricanes, murders--to name but a few.
I, too, am mostly made up of water
Now for a global perspective!
Do you understand the gravity of this situation?
I'm sorry, your time is up.
So where is Carmen Sandiego?
Pee-ew. Did you just pass green house gas?
So what makes you such an expert on climate change?
I'm really up against the world here.
My opponent is clearly a Globalist.
What you lack in a degree, you make up for in real world experience
And this is what happened when Atlas shrugged.
You're getting a little heated.
I fully grasp the gravity of the situation.
Having the whole world on your side still doesn't make you right!
What do you mean you’re just warming up?
"As you can see, the whole world is against me. Sad."
Can there remain any doubt that my opponent’s world view is extremely self-centered?
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Pluto.
Our next speaker needs no introduction...
Stop. You've had your turn.
Everyday her position changes, like 180 degrees.
I challenge my opponent to prove he originated in our solar system.
At first glance the earth seems impressive, but there's a darker side.
I always said, it’s me against the world.
I concede-the world is getting smaller.
Oh! So now you're an expert on climate change?
Me against the world was meant to be rhetorical
We have still yet to see my opponent’s birth certificate.
As you can see, my opponent is in a world of his own.
You may think the world of my opponent now, 
but he will turn on you...every single day!
My opponent does nothing but spin!
What else are you hiding besides Europe, Africa,China, and India?
Now, my opponent would have you believe she’s actually getting hotter with age.
You're all over the place.
I know the whole world is against me...
I'm sorry but you are running out of time.
I would remind my opponent that his time is up.
What world are YOU living in?
My opponent's argument only holds 70% water.
With all due respect, my esteemed colleague lacks real-world experience.
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. You're no Pluto.
Don't be fooled by his promises of the sun and the moon too.
You're not as hot as you think.
And you come up here acting like the sun revolves around you!
The World view seemed to dominate tonight's debate.
I don't believe my opponent understands the gravity of the situation."
Now who's getting overheated!?
Look. It's too big to fail.
You just keep going in circles.
Your lakes are great. I will accept that.
And still you deny being a globalist?
You're just going round in circles
While my opponent clearly has a global perspective, note his bias toward the western hemisphere.
Our next speaker is no stranger to the world stage....
The whole world is wrong. I'm right.
As Atlas was saying just before he shrugged...
How can I have a meaningful debate with you when you keep turning on me?
Well, I really don’t like your latitude.
I like planets that don’t capture greenhouse gasses!
It's all about you, isn't it?
Sometimes I feel as if it is me versus the world!
My opponent continues to go in circles.
You are not the center of the universe!
Do all the Democratic candidates have to be on the stage at the same time?
My opponent obviously doesn't respect borders!
Mars was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Mars.
The gravity of the situation has not escaped me!
Oh, I'm just warming up.
I can see Russia from here.
Fake Planet.
It’s simple, just show us your earth certificate.
Yeah, what makes you a climate expert?
And believe me, this is only the half of it.
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. And you're no Pluto.
I believe you've had your turn.
Time's up.
I studied Venus. I knew Venus. Planet, you're no Venus.
AND she claims to be an expert on global warming!  But I ask, 'WHAT ARE YOUR CREDENTIALS?'
Stop your relentless spinning and let's have a real debate!
Just back from a successful revolution around the sun, let’s  give it up for Earth.
My opponent accuses me of failing to understand the gravity of the situation.
You, sir, are a globalist!
I think I speak for everyone present today to remind you that not everything revolves around you.
You just keep going around and around...
My opponent's claim of "Real World" experience is greatly exaggerated.
I feel like we're just going around and around here.
I can see my opponent needs a decade or two to cool down.
Let's get this straight--contrary to what you may have thought, things don't all revolve around you!!
Sometimes it feels like it’s me against the world.
Let's hear from both sides!
My opponent claims to be the Earth, but then what am I standing on!
Isn't it true that you have never produced a big bang certificate to establish once and for all that you are even a planet?
Let me guess. America first.
I can see Russia from this podium.
I'm gonna stop you because I feel you're just going in circles.
The "Flat Earth Society" opposes all forms of fake news and pseudo-science.
I would remind my worthy opponent that it isn't the only planet in the Solar System.
My opponent is trying to spin his way out of this question.
Atlas will be right back.
Well, yes, but that's a global point of view...
Undignified? Half an hour ago you mooned me!
And now for a more global perspective...
And now, who better to tell us about Earth Day than our next speaker --
Sometimes the whole world is against me!
What do you mean you've warned Mars about us?
Thank you. Now we'll hear from the Flat Earth Society.
Would Atlas please return to the podium?
My opponent thinks the world of himself  . . .
"I'm appalled my opponent would say everyone is on his side.
When I debate, it feels like the whole world is against me.
My opponent constantly changes his position and puts his own spin on my ideas.
Cool it!
Guess again. You’re getting warmer.
We all know that you're in the pocket of Big Solar.
Suddenly Carl found himself in the outer stratosphere, standing behind a podium on a stage of cosmic proportion, and wondering to himself “What the hell was in that chicken quesadilla?”
Okay, I'll concede you appear more worldly.
My opponent blames society for all of her problems.
Let me finish; you had all day on your turn.
You've had your say for the last 4.5 billion years; it's my turn now.
Now, to give us a global perspective ...
Until that last comment, I was warming up to you.
You've changed.
Let me guess, Green party?
Did Atlas call in sick again?
Do you really think you can intimidate The Flat Earth Society so easily?
Fake world
Stop turning and pay attention!
I stand corrected. I guess it IS a small world after all.
Is it getting hotter in here or is it just you?!
The 2020 Presidential Debate: Donald Trump vs. the size of his ego.
I object to your characterization of humanity as a transient pestilence!
While Atlas is on his bathroom break...
Before you begin, I just want to say, we are glad you are here, and we are sorry for not listening.
Come on, you ALL can't be running as Democratic candidates for President.
Ladies and gentlemen, she's mad as hell and she's not going to take it anymore... please welcome...
Enough with your world views.
Can you explain your change in position?
Now, there’s no need to get heated.
I've seen no proof my opponent was born in our solar system.  I stand with the earthers!
Yes, yes....the Western Hemisphere....it's always the Western Hemisphere with you.
And you have a clearly inflated world view!
And are you aware, Planet Earth, that 53% of American can identify you only if you are showing these two continents?
I served with Uranus. I knew Uranus. Uranus was a friend of mine. You're no Uranus.
No, it's not warm in here...it's just you.
My opponent seems to think that the universe revolves around him
Stop. We're sorry!
You keep going around in circles.
Excuse me, you've had your 5 trillion minutes.
Stop! Do you remember what happened to Pluto?
Introducing our first challenger in today’s flat earth debate.
Is it getting warmer in here, or is it you?
And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the sun, who couldn't make it.
Even from this far out, New Jersey still sucks.
I demand to see your birth certificate!
My opponent has Russia in his back pocket.
The earth would now like to speak for itself.
My opponent's term has been one disaster after another.
I always knew it was me against the world.
My opponent claims to be a climate change expert yet holds no degrees.
Today I feel like the whole world is against me.
Why is the whole world always against me?
There is a world of difference between me and my opponent.
I feel as though the whole world is against me.
And I suppose this is when you regale all of us with your “world view”
There you go again.  All you think about is your survival.
Let's see if my opponent can spin his way out of this one.
If you're there, where am I?
..and now, for the council's consideration, we have Planet Earth seeking an eviction notice for 7,542,661,844 tenants on the grounds of ..
My opponent is an unabashed globalist!"
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?
You're putting your spin on everything.
Can you not stop spinning for even a minute?
Enough of your spinning!
And now a word on global warming from an interested party.
A thought just occurred.  Shouldn't you be orbiting the Sun right now?
And my opponent still refuses to produce his birth certificate.
Excuse me, your time is up!
Delivering tonight's rebuttal to the presidential address...
Excuse me, but you don't speak for everyone.
Seriously? When they said I’d be debating ‘Big Blue’, I thought they meant somebody from IBM!
Let me begin by saying that I think the world of my opponent.
Our speaker this evening needs no introduction.
Frankly, I'm surprised by your lack of gravitas.
My opponent will promise you the world, and, yes, technically, he can deliver on that promise.
I'm not the one getting heated...
I'd like to hear what the rest of the world thinks.
It's always "climate change" this, or "global warming" that. Do you care about anything other than yourself, ma'am?
4.5 Billion years and THIS is what you’ve accomplished? I say it’s time for new leadership!
Blah blah Carbon, blah blah conservation...clearly my opponent is not interested in fixing our district’s pot-holes or making our busses run on time.
Hey - cool down!
Don't believe her - it's just spin!
...and now for a more global view...
Why?  Why is it always me, against the World?
Now, I may not be as worldly as my distinguished opponent...
So explain to me again, if you’re here what am I standing on?
And now, a rebuttal from the Western Hemisphere
Mister speaker, I don't think you understand the gravity of your situation!
My opponent seems to believe that the whole world revolves around him. But that hasn't been true since the sixteenth century!
Our next speaker needs no warm up.
You're on thin ice.
You see, my opponent IS a globalist!
Now, for a global view.
You look much smaller in person.
Sorry but I don’t share your worldview.
I knew Mother Earth, and you Sir, are no Mother Earth.
Once again, my opponent uses circular logic.
I have to say I didn't think I would be addressing the entire world tonight.
In all fairness, we will hear from the dark side in about 12 hours.
All the stage’s a world.
On every issue my opponent just goes round and round.
The earth comes to us tonight by way of a generous contribution from The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation...and viewers like you.
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
And now, we introduce the Democratic candidates for the 2020 election.
You ever get that feeling that the whole World is against you?
Your response is all spin and 71% watered down
Don't misunderstand the gravity of my opponent's position
Stop right there....you’re just going round and round and round. What’s your point?
As you can plainly see, it’s flat.
Stop spinning!
It's quite obvious that you are living in your own little world.
My able opponent has a different world view than I do.
You think you're the center of the universe!
And who are you to tell us that global warming is real!?
Hey, you need to cool down.
I have a planet, too...and it's bigger than you. So big. Really big.
I'm not interested in your world view!
Wow...it IS a small world!
I think it’s really insensitive of you to refer to Pluto as a “dwarf.”  It prefers the term “little planet”.
Yes, you finally have our attention.
Yeah, well - that's just Earth's opinion, and as you can see she is only offering one side of the story.
Just hold on a minute. You don't speak for everyone.
Just because you're worldly, doesn't mean the sun rises and sets on you.
Stop! You don’t have the latitude to discuss this topic.
Our next guest needs no introduction...
My opponent engages in nightly dalliances with a celestial body!"
Once again, it's me versus the world.
And now what am I bid for Lake Erie?
I am not for political purposes going to exploit my opponent's advanced age and vast experience."
Who wants a candidate you can walk all over?
Stop right there. I've got a Masters in Oceanography, a Doctorate in Environmental Management and Social Sustainability and I belong to 8 political action groups. What the hell could you possible have to tell me that I don't already know?
I don't care how you spin it....
My opponent, here, is notorious for putting a spin on the position.
Why do you think it's always about you?
I believe in America First unlike my opponent who is a global elitist.
I knew Jupiter. Jupiter was a friend of mine.
My opponent claims he's "too big to fail", but...
And I represent all of you who feel like, "it's me against the world!"
There's no need to get overheated...
Our next guest here is an expert on Global Warming.
There she goes again - blaming the rest of us for her made up problems.
I may not be as worldly as my opponent ...
It's obvious that my opponent does not believe, and has never believed, in 'America First.'
I believe you're trying to change the tropic, sir.
You clearly don't understand the gravity of the situation.
It's always been me against the world.
Everyone should know there is another side of you that is VERY different.
Okay, I'm willing to concede that it's round.
Mind you, I think the world of my opponent....
... and unlike my opponent, I am not a globalist!
As for my opponent, can you trust what doesn't stop spinning?
I want you to know that I will not make age an issue in this campaign."
Tonight’s celebrated speaker is now the hottest he’s ever been.
Don't believe my opponent's whines about feeling too hot. Only 11,000 years ago he was complaining about the cold.
You simply don't understand the gravity of the situation!
Cool down, lady.
My opponent continuously changes her position!
Atlas shrugged, but Dave pontificated.
That's clearly just spin.
And now for a world view.
Point well taken Mother.
Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me.
I knew Pangea.  You, Sir, are no Pangea.
You make a strong argument, but the Flat Earth Society remains unconvinced.
I'd like to motion to limit the scope of this debate.
Allow me to address the elephant in the room.
And finally, our guest speaker to tell us how it all ends.
Sure, my opponent has more than 4.5 billion years of experience, but does anyone really believe she stands a chance against the incumbent in 2020?
Now, see, my opponent is getting a little heated.
We should have opening remarks from Australia in but a few hours.
Clear enough, but there is a dark side we have to take into account.
I don't CARE what the whole world is saying!
As you can see, the entire world has taken a different position than the U.S. on global warming
And, yes, I say that 7 trillion people can be wrong!
Is that the Yucatán Peninsula, or are you just happy to see me?
Sometimes it feels like it's just me against the world.
Is it hot in here? Or is it just me?
Who you gonna believe; me or the World?
Who are you to tell me about global warming?
I humbly submit that what the planet is saying is just one opinion.
Once my opponent turns on you, you’re gonna see a whole different side.
Enough already with the global perspective!
Excuse me, but I believe your 4.5 billion years is up
Go ahead!  Try to deny you're a globalist!
My opponent would have you believe he represents the global perspective.
What’s the world view on this.
Relax, you don’t need to get so heated.
and furthermore, my opponent is unabashedly a staunch globalist!
You've made several billion good points, but now it's my turn.
I don't care what the rest of the world thinks!
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the definitive expert on climate change.
As usual, you're playing the science, evidence, and human race cards.
Don't believe my opponent. She has changed the climate of this debate, and given it her own spin.
And I'm just getting warmed up."
Can we at least agree it’s a global issue?
It’s obvious my opponent has an inflated world-view.
Don't trust him. He's got a dark side.
Please, one continent at a time.
Oh great. Now I've got the weight of the world against me.
Your argument has as many holes as your ozone layer.
While my opponent is heating up, I have remained cool and calm.
As you can see, my opponent is a huge globalist.
Our next speaker will help illustrate the gravity of the situation.
Though the world is against me, I stand by my convictions!
My opponent is a spin artist
And our next speaker needs no introduction...
. . .now if we zoom in you can see my house. . .
Are you really going to play the climate change card?
I understand the whole world is against me, but...
It’s not such a small world after all.
What proof do we have that your policies will be good for the planet?
Sir, I served with Mars. I knew Mars. Mars was a friend of mine. Sir, you're no Mars!
Yes, I agree it's a little warm in here, but it isn't always about YOU!
I will stop my emissions when she agrees to stop her eruptions!
My opponent continues to deny the gravity of the situation.
It appears you don't understand the gravity of your situation
I know Pluto. I served with Pluto. I was friends with Pluto. You, sir, are no Pluto.
It seems my esteemed opponent is going around in circles.
I think we all need to be concerned about my opponent’s health and longevity.
My opponent may have produced diamonds and sunsets, but how many barbecues in Iowa has he attended?
If you truly are older than 4000 years, why do you not produce your birth certificate?
You know you don’t stand a chance of making it through the next four years.
Hang on, ladies and gentlemen, I feel the world closing in on me.
I know Jupiter. Jupiter is a friend of mine. You, Sir, are no Jupiter.”
Hold on, just cool down!
And up there on the left is where Hawaii used to be.
I was right all along! The whole world really is against me!
Welcome our next guest on her farewell world tour.
My opponent is obviously a Globalist....
Can somebody from tech get up here to raise the microphone please?
My esteemed opponent keeps going in circles.
And so my opponent wants you to 
believe, in six days with one day of rest....
Hot or cold. Day or night. My opponent can't seem to make up her mind.
I'm glad you finally came around!
I disagree! Seven billion people can be wrong.
Mother Earth, please do not interrupt when men are speaking.
It's me against the world! But I will prevail in this election!
My opponent is wet, dry, hot, cold...what are we to believe
Sit down dear, men are talking.
You may THINK globally, but do you act locally?
My opponent seems to think he revolves around himself.
That's your 4 billion opinions.
My opponent denies it but he is obviously a blatant globalist.
You don’t have a leg to stand on.
My worthy opponent actually embodies everything that’s wrong with the world.
First of all,my opponent thinks the world of himself.
Let’s not forget that what you’ve heard from my opponent on climate change is nothing more than one planet’s opinion.
My opponent can’t hide the fact that he’s a globalist.
Given how we're treating the world, it seemed only fair to give it a chance to talk back.
You do not revolve around you.
I'm not as worldly as my opponent....
Before we get started, are you okay with the temperature in here?
I will deal in specifics.  My opponent offers only global generalities.
The audience is tiring of your so-called world view.
...and that's where our ancestors lived before that planet became uninhabitable...
If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the solar system!”
You don’t have a point.
We still haven't seen a birth certificate!
Unlike my opponent, I'm not a master of spin.
Come on. Everyone knows you were born in a galaxy far, far, away.
My opponent has a history.
And now, for a global point of view...
It doesn’t matter that the whole world is against me.  Literally.
Sigh... Sometimes I feel like the world is against me.
Please stop. Your gravitational pull is influencing my position.
You and who else?
Do you ever get the feeling that the whole world is against you?
I tell it to you straight,while all my opponent does is spin.
So, you think you can be all things to all people?
Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?
You're obviously a big globalist!
And our Geography Bee winner is......
You see! Spoken like a true globalist.
I know about Jupiter - and you're no Jupiter.
To say our next speaker is 'worldly' would be an understatement
My opponent keeps changing position.
My opponent may look like America now, but spin him around and you’ll see Iran and China!
My opponent and I are a world apart.
A surprise speaker at the flat-Earth convention
I will not make age an issue in this campaign!
My opponent perhaps, has a different world view.
You do Not speak for the entire planet!
Look, there are only two.  Seven continents is only a theory.
My opponent seems to believe he's somewhat of an authority on the subject of global warming.
Who made you an authority on global warming!
My opponent may be more worldly than I, but I speak for the common man.
And now speaking in favor of globalism....
And now, the World's view
I asked for something specific, not Pacific.
We've invited a special guest to talk about climate change...
No one told me it was me versus the entire world!
As for the flip -flopping accusation, my opponent changes position by the minute.
My opponent's stance is all over the map!
My opponent is simply trying to put his usual spin on things.
And for all you climate skeptics out there, please welcome our next guest.
I fear my opponent's ego hinders his judgement, as he obviously thinks the world of himself.
......  AND  my opponent would have you believe that climate change has affected him personally!
Let me finish, I waited  while the 7.53 billion of you spoke.
Could you be any more Pacific?
Hot and bothered are we?
Your arguments are all circular!
My opponent claims to know something about world opinion.
Admittedly, the Green Party's candidate is strong this year.
I think it's time we rotate and let Uganda have a turn to speak.
I think the world of our next speaker...
Stop trying to spin this!
And, yes, I say 7 billion people can be wrong.
My opponent, an aging, bloated, ball of gas, cannot be taken seriously.
You don't look that hot to me.
Unlike my opponent, I will never take certain latitudes.
It is very 'inconvenient' for you to appear for Mr. Gore at this debate.
Look! Nobody cares what you think!
What on earth am I debating?
Thank you, President Trump.  And now for the opposing view on climate.
Don't you turn away when I'm talking to you!
I'm not going to stand here debating whether climate change is real with the whole world watching..
My opponent says I'm a nationalist.  Well, I say he's a globalist!
My opponent doesn’t speak for everyone.
Our next speaker means the world to me.
And now a few words about climate change from a victim.
And the title of tonight's debate is, 'Me Against the World'.
It seems clear that my opponent is uncomfortable on the world stage.
Sometimes I feel like the entire world is against me!
My opponent seems stable on the outside, however on the inside she is toxic, unpredictable, and frankly dangerous.
Sorry to cut you off, Earth, but if we're going to debate the climate change issue, we can't resort to anecdotal evidence.
Cool it, Mother.
I would like to present our guest speaker, an expert on global warming, and...
Either admit you're beholden to a powerful star or denounce the geocentric model once and for all.
Any last questions for Earth?
My opponent is, obviously, an unabashed globalist
And now, straight from an engagement at the Globe Theater, ...
By now, it should be clear that my opponent relies on circular reasoning.
And you are nothing but a Globalist, sir!
Here to explain how she just keeps getting hotter every year, ladies  and gentlemen, I present Mother Earth.
That's not the right answer, but you're getting warmer.
...and here to tell us their thoughts on global warming ...
And may I present our next speaker, who is no stranger to globalist thinking"..
Don't let yourselves be fooled by my opponent's down-home Earthy charm, she's a globalist!
Oh please, stop it! You are not!
The air conditioning is on "high" and frankly,
I'm very comfortable.
We're happy to have one of the hottest new speakers for you tonight, a leading authority in the debate on global warming.
Whaddayamean, “Earth Day’s not enough?”
The whole world is against me!
Would you care to put your spin on this?
My opponent, on the other hand, can't go anywhere without everyone.
At times like this, I feel like it's just me against the world.
Some days I feel like it’s me against the world.
Even if 'parasite' is technically correct, I still object to your characterization of my existence.
And now Mother Earth will explain why we're screwed.
I can’t promise you the world like my opponent here, but…
I didn't know this was a global debate!
But I say all politics are local!
The world does not revolve around you.
I knew Planet Earth, sir,
 and you are no Planet Earth!
My opponent will not stop spinning.
Our next speaker is a Globalist.
When the organizer said “you against the world,” I thought it was just a figure of speech.
My opponent is too old to be President of the United States
And furthermore, I assert that your so-called "global perspective" is nothing more than narcissism.
There is no planet B.
How dare you pretend to speak for Mars!
And now for the opposing view on climate change...
Apparently you are not too big to fail
And, finally, my opponent is only 70% water!
Senator, I served with Earth. I knew Earth. Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Earth.
World. The stage is yours.
No no no...listen, I'll tell you exactly what the world needs!
Hey, if you're here, where am I?
But my opponent here understands nothing on the local level.
Now let's hear from the  rest of the world!
Globalist!
Apparently Atlas shrugged.
Seriously?.... What do you know about climate change?
Regrettably, my opponent can't seem to keep his cool.
Excuse me.  It's not your turn.
If my opponent claims to be a centrist, why is she spinning left?
...and now for the global viewpoint ...
Once again its me against the world.
My opponent would have you believe that it's own well-being is more important than a strong business environment!
Let's hear your thoughts on some local issues.
As I have said over and over, "It is me against the world!"
So what you are saying is its just water weight?"
And now, on the world stage, is someone who needs no introduction.
Can you state unequivocally that you are not flat?
Every 24 hours you flip-flop.
There you again, saying you speak for the entire world!
Now folks, my opponent seems to think this election is ALL about her...
What is your response to recent accusations that you are, in fact, flat?
I think your time's up.
Atlas shrugged, and then left
My opponent promises the moon, but does he deliver?
Oh sure, you CLAIM to be speaking for the whole world...
I, too, am only just warming up!
And now, the Earth speaks for itself.
With all due respect to my fellow candidate, the science is still inconclusive.
I’ll admit my opponent is striking to behold, but look more closely and she’s a hot mess.
While you are obviously well-rounded on this topic, and I do think the world of you, I must respectfully disagree.
The Flat Earth Society debate did not go as planned.
You aren’t the center of everything anymore!
It’s just me against the world!
What do you know about world affairs?
I believe my opponent is going around in circles.
And finally, I promise to stay cool under pressure, something my opponent will never do”
But can you prove your other side isn’t flat?
No, Mars will not pay for your border wall.
Why thank you.  You're pretty hot yourself!
There’s another side to her we haven’t seen!
Look, I really don't think you can be objective in this climate change debate!
If you think you've got problems let's hear from our next speaker....
My opponent is clearly too old to be running.
I feel like the whole world is watching.
Is it warming in here or is it just me?
When I signed up for this Businessman vs. Earth debate, I was expecting a park ranger.
As usual, my opponent is hiding behind his global policy experience.
For millennia my opponent has been circling around solar power.
My opponent would have you believe he is a globalist, but in reality he is a world unto himself.
Why do I feel the whole world’s against me
my opponent of course doesn't have my world view
I think you are forgetting who put you on the map.
Think you can just roll in here and change the world?”
Today more than ever it's us against the world!
‘“And now, taking the yes side in today’s climate action debate...”
See, I'm coming at this from a global perspective...
Our next guest will now share her unique global perspective.
All this guy ever does is spin.
You've exceeded your four billion year time allotment. May I please have my fifteen minutes?
You have no earthly idea what you’re talking about!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our expert on pollution."
Now introducing our guest speaker on how to survive long term abuse
You only seem concerned with global problems
And what makes you such an expert on global warming?
Hey ! Chill already.
You raise some good points, but I still say the science isn't settled.
That's a compelling global perspective, but I don't share your point of view.
Further proof of a globalist conspiracy!
Who knows more about the environment, me or my opponent?
Our next speaker brings a global perspective to the issue.
My opponent thinks the world of himself.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid that Atlas had a prior engagement.....
Let it be noted that my opponent refused to shake my hand.
Stop circling around the issue.
As a flat Earther...
And you, sir, are talking from Uranus!
I admit you do have the weight of the world on your side.
Last but not least, we have a special guest tonight, for all of you climate change skeptics.
Uh, is it getting warmer in here or is it just me?
And I suppose you're an expert on global affairs?
How come it’s always about you!?
Unlike my opponent, I will not try to be all things to all people.
My opponent would have you believe that she speaks for the whole world...
This election is not about you!
I feel like it’s me against the world in this debate!
My debate opponent claims to be down to earth and well-rounded but can he serve in office under the current climate? I think not!
I want to thank Earth for stepping in after that unfortunate Pluto situation.
As you can see here, the World Wide Web has made the world a much smaller place.
First, let me begin by saying that we are worlds apart on that issue.
Oh, spare me your tilted worldview!
I guess we should stop asking for the Moon
Your mama's so fat that she invented gravity.
We have proof that you've been tilting on your axis from the very beginning, so why should we assume you're being upright now? Have you no shame?
Despite her denials,it's clear that my opponent is an unapologetic Globalist.
My opponent would have you believe he’s not really a Globalist...
Some will no doubt say that my opponent appears more worldly than myself.
And last but not least in our Global Warming Conference,
a few angry words from Mother Earth.
Well, you look flat from here.
I refuse to debate a "Globalist"
I don't like your Earth tones!
My opponent here thinks the world of himself.
Let's not forget my opponent's infamous 'grab Saturn by the rings' line.
Somebody your size asking the rest of us to cut back? That's a laugh.
Mother Earth, you ignorant slut.
Admit it.. you've never gotten over being third!
The oil and gas industry has gotten whatever they want out of my opponent for years.
And  now we'll hear from the "earth is round" perspective
Don't you turn your back on me, China!
I never called you flat. I said you were fat.
My opponent is a well known globalist!
You look bigger on TV
I'm not as worldly as my opponent, but who is?
That's a circular argument, and you know it!
My good friend here has an outsize view of his own importance
The country deserves better than your constant spin.
Ladies and gentlemen let's give a nice global warming welcome to our guest.
Hello, world!
My opponent would have you believe she is an expert on the results of climate change.
Just cool it!
Wait a minute, you've had 5 billion 
years to make your point, it's my turn!
Our keynote speaker today on global warming.....
Clearly my opponent doesn't comprehend the gravity of this situation.
I always knew it would be me against the world!
But that's enough from me, let's here from the rest of the world.
As you can see, my opponent is just another global elite.
You have no concept of the gravity of our situation.
Our host needs no introduction.
You can see it's flat. Anything else is fake news.
Well, that's just one opinion!
Excuse me sir, I am not finished denying reality!
Are you saying it's not a small world after all?
Unlike my opponent would have you believe, not all problems have global implications.
I may flip flop, but my opponent here shifts tectonically!
To most of the world, it is not a debate.
I think the world of my opponent, really.
Wait.  We have an earth-shaking announcement.
I've walked the earth.  I've worked on earth.  You , sir, are no planet earth.
How can you possibly expect us to believe that you're warming when you won't even admit you're flat?
Global warming, real or a hoax? Our next speaker brings a special perspective to the debate.
Let's give our next speaker a warming welcome...
I served with Uranus, I knew Uranus, Uranus was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Uranus.
And my opponent is the worst kind of globalist!
Round is just an alternative fact.
No, YOU are a globalist!
My opponent just wants to make this climate change debate about herself.
Whoa! Atlas has shrugged!
He's trying to spin.
Of course my opponent is out of touch...He's four-and-a-half billion years old!
Thank you for inviting me to speak on the World's stage.
Behind my opponent's sunny personality is a dark past.
There she goes, playing the mother card again!
And that's where the wall will go.
‘And our next speaker is a genuine global heavyweight...’
My opponent likes to brag about her sphere of influence.
Vague?! I couldn't be more Pacific.
If I were a little younger, I'd take you outside and circumnavigate you.
I'm not kidding, I really do have the whole world against me!
What makes you think you can speak for all of humanity?
Guys, I think the world is trying to tell us something!
You can't just roll in here and say that.
We all want to save him, but my opponent hasn’t said anything about how much it would cost.
if you’re over there, where am I?
If you are who you say you are...then where are we now!!
What on earth are you doing here?
Climate change seems to be the only issue my opponent wants to discuss.
Sometimes it feels as though the whole world’s against me.
I think the world of my opponent.
My opponent's argument on global warming is clearly biased"
You’re not the center of the universe so please wait for your turn to speak
All the world's on stage.
Six days! And you think you're so special?
What on earth would you know about climate change?
Well I'll tell ya, good people, it's me against the world.
What could YOU possibly know about climate change???
You think you’re so hot!!!
You’re the one that squeezed plants into coal in the first place!
You're getting warmer
And at that moment of the debate the tide changed.
It's not always about You!
Our next speaker is very down-to-earth.
Even as a young man shouting in the street, Buddy always knew he would take on the world someday
You're calling ME a globalist?
My opponent is tempermental and unpredictable at her core.
No, I don't think you revolve around me.
Please give our next guest a warm welcome.
... and now, representing the flat-earth deniers ...
But how can we be sure he actually thinks locally?
Hold on, global issues will get their turn.
Thank you Mr.  Trump.....now we'll hear from the opposition.
Is it me or is it getting suddenly warmer in here?
My opponent knows nothing about the environment.
Please disregard my opponent’s obtrusive attempt to make my hands look smaller.
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
As you can observe, the U.S.'s self-importance is vastly exaggerated here.
I don't care HOW you roll as long as it's not this way!
My opponent would rather sow division, while I look for common ground. We are both, for example, mostly water.
Joining us tonight for the debate on flat-Earth theory, is Round Earth.
Wait. I’m just warming up.
The USA now defers to “The Paris Climate” representative.
you don't seem to understand the gravity of this situation.
My opponent tries to make it sound as if it's me against the world.
The speaker on global  warming needs no introduction.
My opponent promises you the world, but don’t believe him.
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego!
My opponent plays the victim card after every environmental disaster.
Please, what do YOU know about climate change?
What do you mean, "I'll be fine, it's you guys that are screwed"?  
Is that a threat or a promise?
This clearly proves that the U.S.A is moving to the left.
Your Western Hemisphere bias is so blatant and obvious.
And I challenge my opponent to provide evidence that he is actually getting warmer.
As is typical, my opponent remains conspicuously silent on the issue of climate change.
My opponent is obviously a globalist of the worst kind!
This has been blown way out of proportion.
My opponent denies that he is a globalist...….
Stop! You are clearly ignoring the gravity of the situation!
I'll show you exactly what on Earth I am talking about.
Wait a second. If you're here, then where's...
Perhaps my opponent would like to comment on the deadly magma it has been covering up for ages.
You know, we've had hours of debate about climate change. I think I'll let the world speak for itself.
Let me finish ! You had more the 4 billion years to develop your arguments
Ladies and Gentlemen, please give a rousing apology to the world's most prominent authority on climate change.
That's a circular argument!
Clearly, my opponent has a globalist bias.
“And I say that there are NO planets with intelligent life.
... He'll never bring jobs to Smallville.  My  opponent only thinks globally.
What on Earth is going on...?
You think I'm angry now?  I'm just getting warmed up.
One thing I'll say about my opponent. He's very down to Earth
SO WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE THE WORLD OR ME?
And now speaking AGAINST the Flat Earth theory.....
My opponent has a limited world view.
And how do you propose to pay for this "universal " health care?
This debate is pointless. It feels like there’s an ocean between us.
Please hold on until I can get the other half's opinion.
The representative of the Flat Earth Society yields.
Don't stand there and play the victim to me.
Every disaster we've ever had is on you!
Can we please have a debate where you don't completely take over the stage!?
Why on earth would you say that?
I know you collided with other planets.
We will pick up with our lecture about Asia in about 16 hours.
There you globe again . . .
What does this guy know about global warming?
Not only is my opponent a liberal, she is also under the delusion that she is not flat.
The whole world may be against me, but I'm telling you, I'm right.
I strongly disgree with my opponent's world view.
Is this your good side?
As you can see, my opponent has a completely different world view...
I’d like to speak for the eastern hemisphere...
And with all due respect, what in the world would you know about it?
*I* am getting heated?
This debate is going nowhere — the Earth can’t demand we be replaced by a more intelligent species.
Unlike my opponent, I can promise I will never change my position.
So you continue to refuse to acknowledge your ties to the Sun...
And my opponent here is going to promise you the world!
There's another side of her that most of you have never seen!
She constantly pivots.
And then we'll extend the wall from Sishmaref to Santiago and the Eskimos will pay for it.
Clearly, my esteemed colleague has no legs to stand on.
Stop complaining about your issues. The world doesn't revolve around you.
And a round of applause for Earth stepping in last minute for Pluto at this year's planet summit.
Though he scored some rhetorical points, Morris was no match for his opponent in the Flat Earth Society Debate.
Is threatening me with my extinction really the best you can do?
Please proceed, Mother Earth, you have five minutes to rebut Mr. Trump.
Do you ever feel like the world is closing in on you?
No one's listening to you.
I'm a little confused about where you and I stand.
Ok, let's talk about the millions of elephants in the room...
Sometimes I feel like it's me versus the world up here!
Mother I'm not going to get into a debate with you.
Is it me, or is it getting warmer in here?
And once again you are exaggerating your own importance in this debate on the future of Humankind!
Enough of your global perspective.
But what gives my opponent the right to think he's speaking for everyone on this issue?
What more evidence do you need that my opponent doesn't have a point?!
And now let's hear from my opponent... a supposed expert on global warming.
Reports that my opponent is heating up in the poles are ‘fake news.’
You say you're warming. Well, you don't look so hot to me!
Certainly a speaker that should need no introduction, however ...
My opponent, as usual, is trying to put a positive spin on the issue.
From where I’m standing, you still look pretty flat.
Don't worry - I have asked them to turn the AC up!
...and the United Nations will pay for the fence.
As we all know now, my opponent takes a world view.
You're only half right."
Well, one thing my distinguished opponent and I agree on is that it is too warm in here.
No matter how cheerful you sound today, we know that you have a dark side as well.
As a matter of fact, I am right and the whole world is wrong!
All this stage is a world.
The climate of these debates sure is changing.
...and my opponent continues to insist that global warming is real.
Is Atlas still in the green room?
On the contrary, I do think you should revolve around me!
Folks, are you hearing this spin?
You are too polarizing!
Don't turn this around on me, YOU were the one with oil in the first place.
...because we’re Americans and we don’t care if the whole world disagrees!
And with his other face he kisses up to Russia.
Oh . So now she’s going to pull the old Earth card.
I’m not going to make my opponent’s age an issue in this campaign.
Please stop with your spin.
”...And our next guest is hotter than ever...
I too am a globalist.
And YOU need to stop circling around the issue here!
I know my opponent thinks the world of itself...
Atlas ... Atlas? We can't hear you down there.  Can't you get closer to the mike?
And are the allegations true that you have taken explicit, unauthorized pictures of Uranus?
Next, you'll deny you're a globalist.
"And now, taking the position that climate change is real..."
And here to give us the big picture is...
I find my challenger's Earth First campaign to be nothing more than thinly veiled self-serving platform.
And now to update us on the real news about global warming is Mother Earth!
As a Flat Earther, I refuse to believe your "science" and my own eyes.
Folks, sometimes it's easy to feel like it's you versus the whole world.
My opponent is hiding behind a global warming agenda!
And what experience do you have?
Now maybe you can explain what happened to Atlas your biggest supporter
I want to thank you again for the chance to co-host this Flat Earth Society conference.
My opponent acts as if the moon revolves around her.
To kick off our Global forum today I'd like to introduce our first speaker...
Can you believe SHE is running as a #MeToo candidate?
In conclusion, it is clear my opponent is too worldly to understand the plight of the common man.
It may appear that it's me against the world....
I understand you have serious  injuries, but a globe is not a person. Now if you were a corporation, you would have a case.
As soon as the world stepped on stage Jon felt the temperature in the room rise dramatically
Excuse me, but your attitude has completely changed the climate in this room
Please welcome our guest speaker on global warming...
What on Earth did you just say?
No - let me tell *you* the gravity of the situation
Like I've been saying all along, it's me against the world!
Turn sideways so we can see if you’re really round
Back off, I'm warming you.
My opponent acts like the world revolves around him... oh."
And now, it's just 'me' against the world!
I have recently uncovered a sibling of my opponent that he refuses to acknowledge.  Pluto, come on out here….
Of course I can hear you, but I don't believe you!
Don't feign nationalist priorities when you are so obviously a globalist!
One more globalist?
NO - the whole world is NOT a stage
Unfortunately, this simulation developed
 a fatal virus called Homo Sapiens.
Unlike you, I can't speak for everybody.
Hold on folks, she's just getting warmed up.
Looks like we're going to need a bigger wall!
Your isthmus is showing!
Why are you even running? You won't be around for much longer!
And now  a speech about Global Warming from the only opinion that counts.
Madame speaker, be assured that my opponent will soon reveal another side.
What credentials does my esteemed opponent have regarding climate change?
North America is going to speak on behalf of the world again, huh?
Larry’s worst fears are confirmed that it’s always been him against the world.
My opponent would like you to think it’s me against the world
We have nothing to fear but hemisphere itself!
You're always shifting your position!
My opponent is well rounded but nevertheless lacks good judgment.
It only looks round!
It's not fair I only get 15 minutes. You've had four and a half billion years.
I believe we can find some common ground.
If we were on the radio and not TV, I would be winning this debate!
No, YOU'RE polarizing the issue!
Welcome to the climate change conference. 
The first to speak is Mother Earth.
Warming Schwarming— you’re only having hot flashes!
Now, if you could please rotate, so that I may debate Eurasia.
Our expert on Climate Change will now speak
At times like this, I feel that the whole world is against me.
Unlike my opponent, I promise to keep my cool.
Stop orbiting the question.
No, Mr. President, I AM the real world.
And please welcome our guest speaker to this annual meeting of the Flat Earth Society
I implore you to take into account the gravity of the situation.
Did it get warmer all of the sudden, or is it just me?
Well, size isn't everything!
My opponent is a unapologetic globalist!
Enough with the circular reasoning!
Trust me, I'm just warming up.
And to all my detractors who say I have no world view.....
My opponent thinks the world revolves around him
I know our audience will appreciate the gravity of your situation
Our guest tonight at the Planetary Society needs no introduction...
I'd say your connection to South America raises questions of collusion.
My opponent would have you believe the Earth is round.
My opponent is a master of spin: in the last debate he was flat as a pancake.
And now, it is my honor to introduce someone who means the world to me...
Just admit that you're nothing but a shameless globalist!
Nobody knows more about the world than I do.
Unlike my opponent, I speak for more than just half of the world.
Sure, my opponent has a lot of experience in world affairs...
Really?  Do you know how many times I shovelled my driveway last winter?
Cool down!
Maybe it's time you took some responsibility for your own 
well-being.
My opponent is a flip-flopper. Take the magnetic poles, for example.
There she goes with the overheated rhetoric again.
And now it's my pleasure to introduce EVERYBODY'S mother!
My opponent is just spinning as usual.
Hold on, you’re telling me you’ve never seen ‘An Inconvenient Truth’
No really, I feel like the world is against me.
I refuse to sugarcoat facts while my opponent wraps himself in the earth’s mantle, concealing his molten core.
And we at Fox News demand this is a flat disc and not a globe, and if it's not a globe then how can there be 'global warming' eh?
The American people are tired of my opponent’s globalist policies.
Well of course YOU’D be a globalist!
My opponent naively perceives herself as an expert on global climate change.
I know Atlas, Atlas is a friend of mine, and , you sir, are no Atlas
"I would ask the audience to hold their applause until I've had a chance to introduce everyone."
Clearly my opponent is too worldly.
Unlike my opponent, I will not forget the good people in Hawaii.
There you go again...rotating your position."
Hold on just a minute, this has nothing to do with you
Why is it always all about you?!?
How does my opponent KNOW she's not just having another hot flash?
My opponent refuses to debate, claiming that he already represents the entire world.
Like you, I am just warming up...
What on earth is your point?!?
Our final climate change panelist has dire warnings.....
Look, I didn't call you a loser, a terrible, very bad planet...maybe the worst planet in the solar system, and far from the biggest. That was fake news and this debate about climate change is over!
And you misled the people indicating that you were a small world after all.
The last thing we need is another polarizing President.
And what so-called proof do have that the world is not flat?
What makes you think you’re a Global Expert? Fake News!
Now listen--hey, don't you turn your back on me!
You need to see the big picture!
Now take my opponent here, who pretends to speak for the whole world.
Hold on, I didn't interrupt you on the climate change questions.
No,  I don't think you look flat.
Nobody cares about your inflated world view!
There are two Americas!
And unlike my opponent, I do not try to be all things to all people.
My opponent likes to tout his worldliness as a strength
I know Neptune. You sir, you're no Neptune.
Our next speaker is internationally known...
My opponent yet again advocates turning his back on Europe."
Next thing you know, he’ ll be mooning me!
Sure, but can you prove you aren't flat?
Our next presenter will provide a worldview on this topic...
No, that podium does not make your look flat.
Why is every one on your side!?
And now we'll hear the anti flat-earth perspective.
What makes you think you're the expert on climate change?
I'm not afraid to take on the world.
Have you ever felt that the whole World was against you?
That's right China, I'm speaking to you.  Don't you dare turn your back on me.
You're here to tell me the whole world thinks I have small hands!?!?
"It's obvious that my opponent has a globalist agenda!
Hold on! You'll get your turn.
...But my opponent is all spin!
So, what's your worldview?
Sure, we used to think you were flat, but that doesn’t make us “stupid.”
See, I told you it was all just spin.
Unlike my opponent, I have a global view.
You are clearly biased when it comes to climate change.
I think it’s fair to point out that my opponent is a Globalist.
Our next speaker has a first-hand experience of climate change.
Our next speaker literally means the world to me!
This candidate claims to represent all of you . . .
My opponent will literally turn its back on you.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.
My opponent happens to be all wet, or at least seventy-one percent.
Fine, you can have Florida, but New York stays afloat!
Whoa!... Who do you think you are? My Mother?...
Would you stop spinning for a moment and pay attention!
And now, here to refute the "flat earth"  propoents, I present....
And I remind my opponent, all politics is local.
With all due respect, I think you are taking a very one-sided view of the world.
My opponent clearly thinks he's the center of the universe.
Small world.
Let's talk about your global presence...
....while my opponent, though very worldly, has a decidedly western view of things.
And making her final appearance ...
Let's see who revolves around who.
It may be me against the world, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong!
No need to get so heated.
Can you be more Pacific in your response?
I challenge you to think out of your hemisphere
Atlas, get back here !
Even my opponent is warming to me!
It seems my opponent is overly focused on global issues.
Excuse me but I also know a thing or two about climate change.
My opponent’s argument is at least two-thirds under water
Again, we see my opponent going global when I'm trying to talk specifics...
Who on earth do you think you are?
I'll give you that point.  However, ice caps aren't everything.
I'm not sure you're grasping the gravity of what I'm saying.
I may  have the whole world against me in this debate, but...
Only one of the candidates could truly be described as "well-rounded".
And our next speaker deserves our undivided attention!
Many of you scoffed when I promised you the world...
What goes around comes around!
I told Atlas not to shrug
Yes, but can you *prove* you're round?
...a planet that needs no introduction...
I don't care if you're representing seven billion constituents, I deserve equal time.
Yes, ma'am, it does seem to be getting warmer in here.
Yeah?!  Well, I'm freezing!
I object to my opponent's description of me as small and insignificant!
There you spin again
He has a dark side that will chill you.
As you can see, the blue wave is coming
Don't think you're going to win this debate by "going global" on me again!
Don't let my opponent fool you. He is a globalist.
I knew Atlas would be a noshow.
I'm detecting a change in the climate of this debate.
I believe you are not seeing the big picture, Sir
What do you mean that humans are a virus that will soon run its course?
Paper covers rock!
Excuse me, but did my opponent just say, “Earth to Mr. Johnson?”
Pictured above: The first 2020 presidential debate.
Sheer hubris -- My opponent believes that he represents the whole world!
And now, for the right hemisphere point of view.
Let me stop you right there.
There you rotate again.
Our core values are fundamentally different
I told you we're trying to turn the heat down. Just be patient.
As usual, my opponent continues to go round in circles.
This is not about you!
As you can see, my opponent is a globalist.
She's had her 4.5 billion years.
Earth, please, wait your turn.
In last night's debate, Mr. President repeatedly insisted the whole world was against him.
Lock her up!
You are fake news, the world is flat.
Why blame me? Who created fossil fuels to begin with?
And what would YOU know about "climate change"?
I’m sick and tired of my opponent’s non-stop spinning.
It was ever thus -- one man against the world!
You are on a roll, but I'll have to stop you here.
I think we should take a break to cool off
You may have more real world experience, but I'm a man of the people.
My opponent seems to have been crushed by the weight of the world.
Oh, so you think you can speak for everybody?
Hey, don’t get heated with me.
This is why I feel the world is always against me!
How on earth did you come up with that?
My opponent continues to hide his Russia connections!
I am afraid that my esteemed opponent and I are worlds apart!
There's a whole other side to you.
Yes.....sometimes I do feel my stance is 'me against the world'!
Our new head of global marketing needs no introduction.
My opponent has the gall to assert that her health is more important than corporate profits
That question came out of the blue.
I hear you,  but what does the Eastern Hemisphere have to say?
Please, the whole world is always against me.
Where is Atlas when you need him.
And now to explain the effects of global warming ....
Stop playing the victim card!
I can see my house from here!
Let's stop talking about revolution.
You're flat wrong!
You are so bipolar about climate change!
I have here a sworn statement from a Mr. Atlas that says you have lied about your weight.
My opponent clearly has a planet-sized ego.
Enough about you.
Well, I have a different world view!
I don’t understand where you’re coming from!
Why is nobody asking 'Girthy Earthy' over here about her  controversial 'Pangaea Years'?
And more than Utopian, my opponent's demands for a Green New Deal are completely self-interested!
Clearly you cannot believe what you see in front of you, my opponent is flat, and anything else is fake news!
Size matters? Is that all you've got?
I'm not sure you fully comprehend the gravity of this predicament.
Our next speaker brings a truly global perspective . . .
Welcome to the first International meeting of the Flat Earth Society, I would now like to introduce to you our guest speaker...
Be prepared for a heated debate!
And now I let her tell you more about the gravity of the situation.
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF YOUR WORLDVIEW
It's my turn.
Is it getting warmer up here, or is it just you?
"Your oceans are as dirty as your politics! "
I have 7.7 billion constituents and counting.  What's your base?
Call me a dwarf planet again and I’ll kick your Australia.
Atlas, your rebuttal. Atlas?
Ladies and gentlemen, when I speak the world listens.
George faced an unexpected challenge to his claim to be the World's best debater.
I promise my turn won't take all day.
Our next speaker is the hottest thing right now.
I never back down...even when I learned this debate actually was me vs the world!
My opponent is not healthy enough to survive her term in office.
If I want to call you my oyster, by God, I'll call you my oyster.
Why doesn't he show his birth certificate?
And now, to kick off our Flat Earth debate...
And as you can see, my opponent wants totally open borders!
Don't everybody talk at once!
Stop whining!  You’ll still be here when the rest of us are gone.
My opponent claims to be decisive yet somehow can’t decide on a single language.
Stop lying! We all know you're flat!
Where’s Waldo?
My opponent is older than dirt!
You're blowing this thing way out of proportion!
Sure, but next to Neptune you don't act so tough.
When we promise our students the world, we deliver!
You're missing the big picture.
My hands are not small!
It is a small world after all.
The next speaker is here to warm up the crowd.
I personally would like to extend you a warm welcome.
Is that all you do? Just spin, spin, spin?
We'll stop there for today, and the Eastern Hemisphere will pick things up where we left off.
There you go again,throwing your weight around.
My opponent’s presence belies the gravity of the situation!
Global warming!, what makes you an expert?
Oh let me guess, your position on day light saving has changed... again.
I think the world of my opponent but his argument doesn't hold water.
Of course you can take a bathroom break.  You are 70% water.
I've cut taxes for my constituents and eliminated plastic straws. What on earth have you done?
You have been accused of warming! How do you respond?
My opponent has shown he is not capable of carrying the weight of the World on his shoulders.
I might remind you, Sir, that a mere 97% of experts who've studied the matter agree with you
I said “All the world IS a stage” , not on it!
And in a minute, the Eastern Hemisphere’s rebuttal.”
Yes, but you are using the word "round" as if it is a good thing.
Let me remind my friend, all politics is local.
Why, my opponent seems to be warming up to me!
And we can't ignore my opponent's blatant conflict of interest with regards to the issue of climate-change!
OK, now things are going to get heated.
Is it really a matter of such gravity?
America First!
And now the keynote speaker's firsthand account of global warming.
The Earth needs no introduction although some people have apparently forgotten about it.
Yeah? Well, I’m telling YOU that climate change is a HOAX!
Has anybody seen Atlas?
Oh spare me. I took off my Jacket and I'm fine.
If you want to recover from climate change, you first have to admit you have a problem!
I categorically OBJECT to the tactics of my opponent in this flat earth debate!!!
And unlike my opponent I promise to think locally and act purely for personal gain.
Well, I got the popular vote!
And without further ado, a word from our host.
That's just your perspective on global warming!
You'll get your turn when I'm finished
It's just you and me against....oh, wait...
Stop, stop, stop!  We don't want to hear from a climate-change radical.
Now, my opponent is gonna try to use “facts” and “science” about climate change to try to scare ya, but it’s fake news, people!
Do you have to globalize everything?
And now--Our next World expert really needs No introduction!
And here to present the other side of the global warming debate ...
While I appreciate your perspective...in the context of the universe, you are really not that relevant.
I know there have been reports that my opponent is just warming up, but frankly I haven't seen evidence to support that claim.
Don’t all talk at once!
But where is your birth certificate?
My worthy opponent seems to be living in his own world.
Now Madam Earth, isn't it true you're just perimenopausal and temperatures are expected to return to normal in some years?
Here to speak tonight is Mother Earth... and she is a little disappointed in you.
Can you even name the seven continents?
Who will voters believe - a climate denier like me, or my hysterical opponent
While my opponent *claims* to be thinking globally, I believe we can all see a distinctly North American bias.
Yeah, you and who else?
Meanwhile at the UN Climate Change Tribunal: "The Court will now hear victim impact statements"
It’s not a small world after all.
Open your eyes people! The threat of globalization is real.
I am really a much more down-to-earth candidate than my opponent
Today's speaker is seeking political asylum.
As you can see, my opponent is self-inflating.
...."The rest of the world--you have 2 minutes for your rebuttle."
Speak English,please
I firmly disagree that my opponent speaks for everyone.
And to show my sincerity, I'd like to buy my opponent a Coke.
You've already warmed up.
Who in the world are you?
Being in the majority doesn't make you right!
As you can see, my visual aid has crushed my debate opponent and his flat earth premise.
Stop! You’re over inflating your importance!
Small wonder you call yourself a Globalist.
And why should we believe your claims on climate change?
As for my opponent’s more heated perspective . . .
Do not be deceived by my opponent's claims of international experience!
No, you don't speak for the whole world!
I understand that you are the World, but are you the Children?
I was going to mention the state of the planet, but it speaks for itself.
Accept it, you're flat. But here you are, being bipolar
I'll stop addressing you as the pale blue dot when you start addressing me as Dr. Sagan.
In spite of what some may think, this is bigger than me against the world.
If my opponent thinks I'll get pulled into their orbit, they've got another thing coming.
There you go again, always spinning in favor of the globalist agenda.
My opponent, here, wants you to believe in something she calls, 'scientific consensus'
Everything my opponent says about climate change is fake news.
Oh great, another critic on climate change
Oh, sure... my opponent looks cool and international on the surface. But underneath, seethes a core of molten magma.
I have to say at this point that I feel threatened
My turn - your turn went a full day.
Let's give a warm Mars style welcome to our dear old friend, Earth.
I think the world of my opponent, but...
It only *looks* like it’s me against the world
Our guest may be unfamiliar to some of you....
While I appreciate the global perspective, we still need a wall.
No, no. You've had your turn.
You know what they say about planets with small polar ice caps...
You're getting too heated.
Your time is up.
The world will try to tell you otherwise, but I’m here to tell you...
My opponent lacks gravity.
My opponent lacks a solid core.
Yeah? Well my opponent was once involved in a big bang, too!
I'm not going to debate it with half the world
Bob felt like the whole world was against him.
While I think the world of my opponent...
Of course my opponent backs the Green New Deal, she’s a globalist.
What would my opponent know about climate change?!"
I still say you are flat
Let me start by just saying, you've always meant the world to me.
Shame! My opponent voted against Pluto staying in the Solar System!
Unlike my opponent, I'll resist taking such a polarizing position.
Consider this your global warning!
And speaking of global affairs...
I would challenge my opponent to pick a hemisphere.
Let the World speak for itself.
America, sir, will not let globalism crush our dreams.
well, it doesn't feel warm in here to me!
You heard the moderator, your time is up. And if I'm voted into office, I'll make sure of it!
I assert that my opponent is clearly out of its orbit!
Typical globalist!
I just think we have differing world views
All of the white space was once habitable.
...In contrast, my opponent thinks the world of himself.
That's circular reasoning...You keep going around and around and around.
How can I debate you? You've come 180 degrees on your argument.
Oh, now you're warming up to me?
Now my next statement may send you into orbit...
Wait a second!  When I elected to take on the Global Challenge, this isn't what I had in mind.
Whew, someone’s got a terrible gas problem.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the English-speaking world!"
you‘ve had all the time in the world to make your point, now it’s my turn
I understand your position, but no need to get heated!
Stop playing the global warming card.
Actually, there are five Great Lakes.
Don't deny you're a globalist.
I apologize for my opponent's behavior, he's getting very heated.
Indeed, it is a small world after all.
Unfortunately, our guest speaker, Atlas, was hospitalized with a neck injury.
Things may seem dark right now, but I’m certain you’ll turn it around!
Hold it, don’t everybody speak up at once!!
...and pay no heed to my opponent who is clearly a globalist.
How on earth did you get in here?
My worthy opponent's global ambitions won't fix the potholes in our city.
Going once, going twice...
And I ask you, who created those fossil fuels?
Enough with your global elitist spin!
Well, that's your opinion.
I don't believe in global warming and won't be bullied by someone much larger than me.
But if you're here, what planet are we on? None of this adds up!
I thought you were bigger.
The Flat Earth Society begs to differ.
Today the President will put an end to the fake news that he does not know the names of the continents.
I will not be intimidated by my opponent.
Hi Mom !
And now, our world-renowned expert on world climate change.
This is so fake, folks. He's actually very, very flat!
My opponent talks big, but hides half of his true self.
Well, I act locally!
I'm the only candidate prepared to take on the world!
'I'm sorry,  but us flat earthers need more conclusive proof.'
Chill, Dude!
I said you're incompetent, not 'incontinent.'
Can you move a little more to the right, you are blocking the air-conditioner.
Stop turning to the audience and answer me!
It’s pretty much has always been me against the world. This debate however, takes it to a whole new level.
Another expert on global warming.
. . . . and I have been authorized to speak on behalf of the other seven planets about their experiences with ignoring climate change."
As you can see, this new technology brings the world closer.
. . .and you sir are no Pangea!
Now, first up -- speaking for the ozone layer.
There’s an ocean of difference between my views and those of my opponent.
I'm a politician, dammit.
I don't have to listen to you.
On second thought, warming up before the debate is entirely optional.
And here to talk about the global economy...
Where’s Hawaii?
Following Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot success, Ed misjudged his Ted Talk audience
My opponent over here seems to be getting a little heated!
The whole world is against me in this debate!
There is literally a world of difference between us.
The title is "What goes around, comes around."
Ok ok, it's not a hoax
So I ask  you, what qualifies my opponent  to speak on world problem.?
No one wants to hear your environmental claptrap.
As I was saying, I've always felt like it's me against the world
This is THE conference on climate change! You can’t just roll in here and expect a seat at the table!
As you can see, my opponent is the very image of an unrepentant globalist.
I'll gladly address all your issues, but only once you tell me how you got into this building.
This is what it’s come to, since none of you will listen to the scientists.
You expect me to debate the world?
We've been talking about it long enough. Now is the time to let the planet speak for itself.
Even though the whole world is against me, I'm undaunted!
Despite my opponent's outlandish claims and bizarre histrionics, my belief in a flat earth is stronger than ever...
Is it just me, or is it hot in here?
What we need is a "world view," my opponent clearly does not have that.
Stop right there! We booked the Eastern Hemisphere to speak tonight!
'"My opponent is trapped in circular reasoning!"
From now on, we will hear the testimony of the victim of global warming.
I'm right and the world is wrong
Quit complaining, we’re all hot in here”.
You can't handle the heat!
My opponent would have you believe global warming is real!
I can't take this. Make the world go away.
You don't understand the global implications.
And we are supposed to just take your word that global warming is real?
Closing arguments will be three minutes, except for earth, who will have eternity.
This is only 1/2 of the story
I yield to my opponent who would like us all to go somewhere else.
I got it, it's me against the world.
I don’t care if the whole world is against me, I do not believe in global warming!
You don’t intimidate me, you’re mostly water weight
You shouldn't allow yourself to get so heated!
You made your point, but what does the other half of the world have to say?
Our next speaker is out of this world.
I'm sure our next guest needs no introduction
It’s me against the world in 2020.
Our next speaker claims to be quite the expert on climate change...
Earth: #MeToo
‘What on earth..??’
Our next speaker will dispel the flat earth myth.
I have a certain global perspective that the other candidates don't.
Hey, I can see my house from here!
Read my lips: No new axes!
And now, a word from our Mother.
My opponent would have you believe that she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders....
I know an occident waiting to happen when I see one.
We could finally get rid of daylight saving time if you would stop your tilting.
Like my opponent,I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders.
My opponent’s world view is inflated.
Could you move the microphone further from D.C? Thanks.
No, all the world is not on stage!
You may have the world behind you, but I have the money.
And here’s my opponent who just rolled in to give you some really bad news.
My opponent would like you to be believe he is somehow more worldly than you or I
Don’t bring my sun into this.
If Fox says you're flat, you're flat.
My opponent likes to put the spin on just about every position.
What was it like coming out as Gaia?
Despite the evidence before me, I still maintain my opponent is flat.
Sorry, I think we have more pressing matters to discuss than your personal health.
Will you please do me a favor and stop rotating, you're making me dizzy.
Nobody does global politics better than me. No one.
So what?  MY earth is much, much bigger!
You get your climate under control.  Then we'll talk.
Only a closeted socialist would believe my opponent "supports life as we know it"
So,as you can see,"me against the world" was NOT hyperbole as my opponent has claimed.
Sooo...trying to intimidate me on a global scale, eh?
I'm here to remind you that America is not the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce MotherEarth on her Farewell Tour
This is not what I meant by a worldwide debate!
It's true - the internet does make the world smaller
My opponent promises the world but don't be fooled by cheap parlor tricks.
As you can plainly see, the Chinese are behind this!
Oops, we seem to have lost Atlas.
Why yes, it is warm in here.
And you think you're better suited to deal with the problems of the world?
I'm just getting warmed up
Could you turn around to show you’re actually round?
I say, release those so-called evolutionary records, Madame!
Senator, I lived on Mother Earth. I knew Mother Earth. Mother Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Mother Earth!
He’s got the whole world on his stand.
This is hardly what I had in mind when I agreed to debate a globalist!
And now for the  "climate change isn't real" rebuttal.....
You are a hoax.
Everyone knows you’re flat.
Your plan is all about YOU, isn't it? You say, 'My air is dirty. My water is polluted. My animals are dying!' I say Americans are tired of narcissistic politicians!
My very, very brilliant scientists, and they’re like really smart,  are telling me that the Trump Administration is a hoax, okay?
Absolutely! But I could give you a better answer if your question was a little more Pacific.
Wait, one at a time.
You're just here for the air conditioning.
You look fine to me.
My opponent is full of hot air.
With absolutely NO academic or scientific credentials, how can you stand there and tell us global warming is real?!
Nobody has ever been more round than I am, that I can tell you.
Senator, I served with Neptune. I knew Neptune. Neptune was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Neptune.
And our keynote speaker is the late great planet earth.
Atlas has left the building!
Empirical evidence aside, you're flat.
We both read 'Atlas Shrugged', but one of us took it too literally.
I apologize, no reason to get hot.
And I disagree with your world view!
You don’t speak for all of us!
I am sick and tired of people speaking for the Earth-
Let the Earth speak for herself!
… while my opponent just stands there getting hot under the collar.
Now my opponent here claims global warming is real.
Sure, my opponent seems American. But he hides an insidious socialist secret behind his back.
The white areas are recent Facebook outages.
Next side, please.
It's getting a little warm in here.
Please stop overstating what you bring to the table.
Your perspective is way off.
Unlike my opponent I speak for the one percent
Trumps Ted Talk on Global Warming... "We've got a Earth, a big big Earth, the biggest Earth that Earth has ever seen"
On this issue, I'm sure my opponent, like all Progressives, will claim to speak for the World.
I believe my opponent is involved in a global conspiracy!
I can tell from that last comment that you’re getting a bit heated.
And just how is it our fault that you run hot and cold?
Do not be fooled by appearances! My opponent only seems to be down-to-earth.
Getting a little heated, are we?
The Democratic field is crowded.
My opponent would have you believe he is round
Global warming? What planet are you from?
And yet, my opponent claims that I blow things out of proportion.
And now, we finally will listen to the Earth!
Ok! I admit it! Climate change is real!
Sir, I lived on the earth in 1950. The earth in 1950 was my home. You are no earth of 1950.
Oh you think your so worldly!
Flat?!  Do I look flat to you?
Before I present our keynote speaker; Would event staff please lower the thermostat?
Year after year, you just can’t help yourself from circling back to the same point.
It’s easy for your to say, “think locally, act globally,” but what about the rest of us?
You may have all the facts in the world, but I have public opinion on my side.
Cut the global positioning
I take issue with your heated argument.
Earth, you ignorant slut!
Once again, my opponent and I are worlds apart on this issue.
I am pointing to the only country on the planet that is not fighting climate change.
I cede 2,000,000,000,000,000 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Solar System
Do I hear a second for ordering the rotating base?
My opponent’s plan would take ages.
The country is frankly fed up with  your constantly revolving positions.
But Europe and Asia are on the other side of your position.
My opponent presents the Western viewpoint...
You are out of orbit!
Indeed, my opponent holds a more global view.
I think the world is trying to tell us something.
Okay, let me stop you right there.
Well... you're fat.
Here with an opposing viewpoint is a globalist.
We've discovered this lovely blue planet in orbit around a distant star in our galaxy that supports life. But there are no signs of intelligent life.
What do you mean my time is up?
And I'll speak for the rest of us.
I'm sure it is hard to hear that you only have twelve years left.  May I suggest a bucket list?
And last, but not least. Mother Earth.
And now let’s hear from the America’s with their side of the story.
So, Mr. Atlas, what is your position on global expansion?  Mr. Atlas?...Mr. Atlas?...
Could we please have a question on something other than climate change?
Please try to resist my opponent's natural gravity and focus on the issues.
Don't blame us! You're the one who turned dinosaurs into oil!
Okay Atlas . . .who shrugged?
The time for action has come....the world has spoken.
You just think you're getting warmer.
Break into "We Are the World" and I'm outta here.
That's quite the spin you put on it!
You're always throwing shade."
Tell us again why we should care.
I agree we can put that whole flat earth debate to bed.
Adios to my opponent!... crushed by carrying the weight of the world on his shoulder.
Thanks for leaving your orbit, now do you feel the gravity of our situation ?
This year the Golden Globe goes to....
Fake news! the world is flat.
You may have the world on your side, but I know I’m right!
It is with great pleasure that I introduce someone you've all been dreading to hear speak.
Perry makes the best of his magnificent opportunity to address the world at large.
My opponent is spinning lies!
Yeah, yeah sure, cry me a river.
You take one position, then do an about face and it's the very opposite.
Clearly my opponent has taken his view of globalization too far.
A vote for me is a vote against the world.
You what ? You just rolled over a guy with yellow hair and a long red tie ?
No, no -- you're confusing weather with climate.
Is it just me or is it getting warmer in here?
She needs no introduction.
You don’t seem warm to me!
Theory yes,but what does my opponent know for a fact about climate change?
Ok, so maybe humans did cause it, but we didn't mean to.
That's quite the costume, Donald.
My opponent thinks he is so worldly!
And this is the planet earth, a bleak and forbidding place that once supported a primitive life-form inexplicably bent on self destruction.
I can tell you right now that you are most certainly not warming at all, and what's more, you're flat...
Well of course 'Big Earth' is against climate change.
You may say you are warming but the GOP is not impressed
Apparently, my opponent considers herself the "change" candidate.
No I don't accept coal money, but you're getting warm!
You don't speak for everybody
As a white man, I obviously know more about the environment than Mother Earth.
So as you can plainly see, its round on this side, but its flat on the other!
May I just say, you are my Oyster.
And although my opponent will say she has the entire world on her side . . .
Sorry, but we don't care for your opinion on climate change
While my opponent may have a world view....
Can I speak to your Russian side, please!
Do you know who I am?
Let me tell you what the world needs...
I  mean, it's flat.  Look how flat it is.
They say that the whole world is against me, but I know it's not true. Some of the smaller countries are neutral.
I don't think the Earth should have a say in this!
My opponent makes a compelling argument, but we still maintain that Earth is flat!
I am not now, nor have I ever been, an extraterrestrial.
Global domination on a world stage.
Round, schmound. The real question in this election is, "Where's Atlantis? What have you done with it?"
The world may disagree with me, but I stand firmly by my belief!
When the world talks, people, listen
And ask yourself: who exactly will my opponent represent?
So who ya gonna trust, me or this ignorant orb?
Is it not now completely obvious that my opponent is full of hot air?
And arguing that climate change is real....
You yielded your time, it's my turn to talk about the environment.
Yes, I do stand by my position that the earth is flat.
I don’t have to listen to you anymore, Mom.
It's okay, I've got the electoral college votes.
All my stage is a world!
I yield my time.
You think you're the center of the universe! Stop throwing your weight around.
Bet you can't spin that one.
Don't get me wrong. I think the world of you!
The problem is clearly bigger than both of us.
I don't think you have the authority to talk about global warming.
Are you threatening me with extinction?
Next, we will hear from the Western Hemisphere.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I introduce the Democratic Nominee for President, The World.
On the other hand, look at my opponent.  She's all over the place!
As a fossil fuel CEO, I know hot, and as yet, you, Madam, are no Venus.
We don't care what the world has to say. We're America!
Easy, big fella! Some boundaries! Please!
My opponent will try tonight to convince you that he is flat.
And now I’d like to introduce the world’s biggest Flat Earth skeptic.”
this is just a debate,you need to cool down.
I've come here to say: I'll be fine. You'll be dead. Keep up the good work.
what makes you think you are getting warmer??
Who are you to say the earth isn't flat?!
You’re spinning my words again...all day long with you — spin, spin, spin!
Think of your ice caps before you let this debate get any more heated!
OK, you made your point: you are round.
I refuse to go there.
As anyone can see, my opponent's reasoning is completely circular.
Just look at the size of his lands.
Global inflation is a looming problem.
How do you call yourself global when you are clearly only representing the western hemisphere?
Isn't that sort of a global response?
Why should voters believe you about global warming?
As you can see, my opponent and I are a world apart on the issues.
Oh, and what evidence can you submit that PROVES you're not actually flat?
You do look flat!
So you just expect us to take your word for it that you're getting warmer?
You're talking in circles.
So maybe I shouldn't have told Atlas to shrug...
And now Gaia will speak to the pro side for human extinction.
You can say "round, round" all you want but you look flat to me
I, on the other hand, firmly reject globalism!
With all due respects,my opponent's personal experience with the enviornmental impact of human activity is anecdotal and , therefore,not relevant to our debate.
I would warn you about being swayed by my honourable opponent’s easily discredited  “One World” philosophy.
Excuse me!  You’ve been getting hotter and hotter throughout this whole climate change debate!
Wait! It's not my fault. I belong to the Sierra Club
Now we get to hear from the small world after all!
The era of what goes around comes around is over!
Going, going............
I served with Planet Earth. I knew Planet Earth. Planet Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Planet Earth!
Enough with the 'think global' already!
No one's looking for a revolution.
Not buying it, still flat.
...political chaos, pestilence, overcrowding and you've got a fever...is that what we need in a sophomore class president?
No sir, it only "feels" like the weight of the whole world is on your shoulders.
So, can you tell us all a little more about this 'round-earth theory' of yours?
Going twice at $14.99.
Moreover, my opponent is not even a U.S. citizen!
My opponent would like you to think he has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
I object!  You are only showing one side.
Will you please cool off!!
So please, during the debate, no releasing of noxious clouds of methane from your tundra.
Well, what the hell do YOU know?
My opponent is nothing but a single-issue candidate.
And I will make the Earth great again.
My opponent here, thinks he holds a world view.
All right Earth, calm down. You're getting a little heated there."
Ma’am, please calm down. I’m afraid you’re getting a little heated.
We get it. Your platform is climate change.
Who in the world asked for your opinion?
I knew Europe.  Europe was a friend of mine. America - you are no Europe.
The whole world is listening.
Would you stop going in circles? Things are getting heated.
Yes, yes, I get your not-so-subtle point, Mr Atlas.
I can't speak for the World, but....
OK,OK, we'll listen!
You wouldn’t know it from my opponent, but there’s a whole other side to this story.
My opponent is a globalist.
If my opponent is actually warming, burning, or on fire, wouldn't we all have seen smoke?
I just want to say that I think the world of our next speaker.
Please give a nice round of applause for our next speaker at this flat earth fact finding symposium.
Don't go all global on me!
A vote for me, Donald Trump, and I can make all this go away.
My opponent can't seem to stop talking in circles.
Don’t you go mansplaining climate change to me.
Do not listen to my opponent. Clearly, he is a globe-alist.
Doesn't feel that warm to me...
My opponent shows a clear north-south bias
Hold it right there...how can you claim to speak for the whole world when I stand here in opposition ?
And now to speak to us about global warming.
Flat-earthers: "Fake news"
And contrary to the President's twitter assertion,  the world is round.
Need I point out, globalism is out of control!
We will no longer comply with the Paris Climate Accords despite the opposition!
Sorry, but I think your argument still falls flat.
I feel like it’s me versus the world up here!
Please don't mansplain ozone depletion to me, sir
What possible impact could you have on me?
the whole world is ganging up on me, not fair
Yes, my opponent is definitely more worldly than I.
While my opponent might have science on its side, I have the unerring wisdom of Twitter on mine.
Sorry.
All my opponent cares about is herself!
Mr Atlas will be back in a moment!
Where's Atlas you asked?
Make the Americas Great Again!
I concede that my opponent's arguments are supported by the weight of world opinion...
I get it - you're a big picture guy. But, you have to consider the details.
Thank you, Ms. Terra, your five minutes are up. The spokesman from OPEC will now read a rebuttal.
"I see a world of differences between my opponent and myself."
Just who does my opponent think he is, claiming to speak for the entire world!
Hold it right there. Prove that you're getting warmer.
Who would ever elect everyone's mother and an obvious globalist?"
Let's give a great big welcome - to everyone!
My opponent appears to be having hot flashes.
Our next speaker will be Donald Trump's ego.
My opponent promises everything in the world.  But can he really deliver?
Without further ado, I give you Mother Earth
... and I say the earth is flat!
The world will little note nor long remember what I'm saying here.  Nevertheless, I persist.
Here on Mars Today, we ask “ Earth , is there life on you “”
There’s a world of difference between us!
I offer all speakers a bottle of water, but you’re right—it was uniquely insensitive in your case.
Our next speaker wants to weigh in on the debate around the use of the word "globalist".
I think it's fairly obvious that I speak for everyone here...
Don't be fooled. My opponent is simply putting its own spin on the same old argument.
My first visual aid: The earth is flat.
Hold It!! Atlas is still in make-up.
You don’t feel warmer to me.
Indeed, my opponent’s life revolves around me.
Stop the World. I want to get off.
With that, I conclude, that Earth is in fact, flat.
Now that your Antarctic ice-cap is gone, what have you done with the penguins?!
Sure, you think globally, but you sure aren't acting very locally.
If my opponent didn't want us to use fossil fuels, why did she provide them to us?.
And I happen to think that politics are local.
I'm sorry, but "The World is Not Enough".
Easy for you to criticize. You just keep turning.
Well, that’s not what Mars said!
You think you have problems? Welcome to MY world!
And I say you DO have room for 3 billion more people!
I dare my opponent to not put spin on his comments.
It's just me against you now.
Yes, my opponent may be more worldly...
Don't be so smug. We all have a dark side!
You are full of hot air and it’s actually killing me.
Our next speaker will discuss the benefits of gravity and why you all don't fly off into space.
My opponent claims to care about the Earth...
Isn’t it curious how my opponent’s solutions always seem to benefit mostly her?
Mars, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!
Although you did not precisely  guess my position on climate change, you are getting warm.
Even now you can't stop spinning. . .
Yes, it’s your fault.
Now for an opposing view in our climate change debate,  from Planet Earth!
There it  is !  My half world view.
Is my opponent getting HOTTER or is it just me?!
I dare you to speak with one voice.
I'm warming up to you.
My opponent is resorting to her usual scare tactics.
Well, that’s one opinion.
...my opponent here has connections to radical environmentalists and vegan activists!
You don't have a leg to stand on in this climate change debate.
My opponent here claims to be his own man, but in reality he's still being pushed around by the sun.
You may in fact speak for the Americas, but I answer to Bezos.
Not your turn!
Just because you’re more worldly does not mean you get to dominate this debate!
Your circular logic has no place in this debate!
Stop! As the President of the Flat Earth Society I refute your lame hypothesis.
Excuse me, please don’t Earth-splain to me
Let me ask you this: What has my opponent ever done for you?
How dare you speak for the world!
I think the world of my esteemed opponent,but he lacks the necessary gravitas
I don't believe this fake news. The earth is flat!
No, I don't think it's warm in here!
We can fit the whole world on this stage, but we can’t fit all the people running for President!
My opponent refers to herself as a so-called expert on climate change, but I don't buy it.
I am calling into question, my opponent's qualifications on climate change.
The whole world is watching!
Climate change? You're being shrill and hysterical. That's exactly why you can't be trusted to regulate yourself.
I should know better than Earth here, I've studied climate change for ten years!
There's no need to get so heated.
With all due respect Sen. Earth, how is your distribution of resources for billions greater than my need to support my business?
Stop embarrassing me, mother!
As you can see, the opposing candidate is full of hot air.
When they said it'd be "me v. the world," I didn't think it would come to this.
When we at the EPA were invited to this debate on climate change, we weren’t told we would be debating the entire world!
I'm here to tell you: I'm burning up on the inside, too!
She’s well rounded, but her foreign policy is superficial at best.
You fit into a two-dimensional cartoon, that proves you're flat.
I am from the Trump Administration and I say the world is flat!
Stop looking at my notes!
Okay, I’ll concede that you’re round!
My most worldly opponet yet
My opponent  claims to be affected by Climate Change
And on this side we have the opposing view on global warming.
My opponent is inflating his view.
Of course I believe you're warming up --- especially since you dripped ice water all over half of the chairs in the Green Room!
As you can see North American is barely connected to South America
Let earth speak for itself.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have earth-shattering information!
Now, I know my opponent claims to have something in common with every single one of you....
So every 60,000,000 years or so you change. Very unreliable. So what's it's going to be this time?"
My opponent here is so old that when he went to school they didn’t even have history.
My opponent wants you to believe he's not flat.
I now yield to my opponent from the North, South, East and West.
My opponent here would like you to believe he’s God’s gift to the world.
In spite of mountains of evidence, my opponent  insists she’s only 2000 years old.
You haven’t got a leg to stand on!
There was absolutely no collusion with either continent!
First, I would like to address my opponent's claim that the earth is round...
That’s unfair! Of course you can promise them the world!
Sorry, but you are flat-out wrong!
My opponent will promise you the world, but does it look like he can deliver?
Apparently you're unaware of how I destroyed Jupiter in last night's debate or you wouldn't even be here.
And I repeat, it's just us against the world.
Nobody cares what YOU have to say.
I think I know a little bit more about globalization than you.
I can safely say I speak on behalf of the world...
My opponent simply has no worldview whatsoever
You created the swamp!
Who said you could have a say?
You don’t get a say in the matter!
Global warming? Hah! You don't look so hot to me!
Is it hot in here or is that just you warming?
And see that up there?  That used to be the United States, but their Congress allowed a narcissistic sociopath to be president.  The country is now just a blip in history.
... and I intend to prove you are flat in this debate...
What in the world do you mean?
Well, "Mother" Earth, a little contraception wouldn't hurt, you know.
Obviously my opponent is feeling the heat!
Yeah, your ego is big, but my ego is bigger. I have the best ego.
If global warming is real then why aren't you sweating?
My opponent thinks he’s the world authority on everything!
No, this isn’t what ‘America First’ means.”
You claim you're feeling warmer but have you ever considered it's just a hot flash?
Don't fall for my opponent's circular reasoning.
There was NO ROTATION!
I’d like to teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony...
You have one minute for the rebuttal; and please don't stop spinning.
So you're saying that Al Gore doesn't deserve all the credit for the documentary either?
You see. Flat!
As you can see, my opponent is constantly getting hot and bothered.
Your policies seem to be very self-serving.
Turns out you aren’t flat, but you’re still not warming!
As you can clearly see, my opponent is a globalist of the worst kind.
There's a world of difference between you and me.
I’m sorry, but the correct spelling is P-A-N-G-E-A
I will not feel your forehead because I absolutely do not believe global warming is real.
My opponent is living proof that the polar regions are disappearing.
Joining us tonight for our discussion on flat earth theory, is Round Earth.
Is that all you have to offer?
What the liberal candidate WON'T tell you is that he's been involved in every bad thing that has ever happened!
My opponent freely admits that she longs to return to the Stone Age.
Yes, and in this election, it truly is me against the world.
We all think the world of you, but you can't keep hiding your dark side.
Global warming is a hoax, despite what this so called ‘expert’ may have you believe!
My opponent has accused me of not being 'down to earth!
Are you okay? You feel hot.
you act like you're sooooo worldly
. . . and that is why I don't call my opponent Mother Earth. I call her Fatty McEarthface.
And with her first try at slam poetry, here’s Earth with Get the #*%€ off of me!
I still have the floor, or crust, if you prefer.
That's it? Hardly earth shattering news.
Hold on there, this is a CPAC meeting, we do not care what you have to say.
Oh fuck.
I’m not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.
My opponent has been touting the same circular argument for less than 10,000 years!
My fellow citizens, don't let my opponent continue to polarize us!
Cool down, you are getting a little too heated.
You'll be able to see my unbelievably tremendous wall from this far away, I promise
My opponent simply continues circling the point in a roundabout way.
Just stop! I'm getting off.
I pledge to act in the best interests of the little man, whereas my opponent’s policies are clearly self-serving.
Sir, I object to your use of "We Are the World" for your campaign commercials.
Our guest speaker will argue for the colonization of Mars
No borders? Are you kidding me?
I have no response to my opponent's heated argument.
Let everyone note how you consistently change your position on the issues as you rotate.
You’re flat out wrong!
I'm sorry for getting so heated, but you started it.
Well, there’s really no room for debate.
My opponent is completely exagerrating the problem of global warming.
It's quite obvious my opponent has no plan to fight inflation.
So..extinction, yes or no?
Contrary to my opponent, I'm here to talk about good clean coal!
Isolationist vs Globalist
... and the people will not by your "too big to fail" argument.
OK earth (if that is your real name), tell us what you know about global warming
You’ve heard from the rest of the world, now it’s my turn.
I can also have a global perspective!
The voters have heard enough of your global view.
Well what about the European view.
Where on earth did you get that idea?
The question is why is my opponent getting so heated in his argument.
And now, I present the Flat Earth Society's keynote speaker!
My opponent continues to argue that climate change is real.
Your globalist view holds no weight here!!
Hold your ozone. Your chance to speak will be after the 2020 election.
And I think I speak for the entire world when I say....
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You’re getting a bit heated there, buddy.
Warming shwarming...what makes you an expert.
I said it once and I'll say it again, it's not just about you!
We’ll take a five minute break as Atlas goes to the bathroom.
How’s the weather ?
My opponent says she's just getting warmed up. I say that's a hoax.
Surely, my opponent exaggerates.
Sheer, unmitigated, hemispherism!
Forgotten for so long........here she is
Mother Earth!
Just wait a minute, you'll get your turn.
I’m a middle-aged American man—
I have plenty of perspective!
And now Miss World will say a few words.
Could you just be a little less global?
OK, you do feel a bit warmer, but still. . .
Even your delivery is flat.
Shakespeare was right, all the world is a stage.
I think the American people have the right to know about your allegiance to foreign countries.
Try to see it from my point of view
I wonder, where on earth is my opponent tonight?
I don’t care what you say, I believe you are only 5,000 years old.
Mother Earth waits for her turn to speak at an Anti-Climate Change Conference
Yes, but what have you done for us lately?
You need to wait your turn
I heard you the first time ‘round
Wrong!
Wait a minute, you'll get your turn.
He wasn't even born in America!
Rolling along now to our next speaker, who needs no introduction.
I served for 30 years on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources-what experience do you have?!
And needing no introduction, it's A Small World.
Hey, I'm a victim too...my air conditioning costs have doubled!
I feel like we're just spinning in circles
Flat, I say!
Why madam, you are nothing but a climate change alarmist!
My opponent will tell you he is getting warmer, but I say that is fake news.
A whimper? That's your closing argument?
And standing in for Sisyphus, let me introduce the ball.
See, look! You're flat!
OK, I admit you're not flat, but you're still small.
Ma’am, your personal problems are of no concern to the american people
All the World's a Stage - Well!
Our next speaker has the audacity to think she can change the world.
And, next up on ‘Hot or Not’....
Where on Earth did that idea come from?
So let's start from the beginning.
In the interest of hearing from the WHOLE world, we will now hear from French Polynesia.
Nor will I allow the age and experience of my opponent keep me from the truth!
Your evidence for whether you speak for the whole world is flimsy at best, sir!
Sure. I know it doesn't look like much now. But a border here and a wall there... it'll be great!
The discussion is getting quite heated from your side.
No, no - I act locally!
...Now, the whole world may not like my opinion, but hear me out!
Now you’re dying? You’ve been fine for a bazillion years!
You only represent the special interests!
He's a down-to-guy kind of earth.
I did reserve the right to say; "I want to get off."
Please don't interrupt,ma'am,I'm not done explaining the way the world works.
And now we bring you the presidential debates, Trump vs. the Democratic candidates.
Alrighty, everyone. The next speaker will be on overpopulation, pollution, and politics.
I think I know more about global warming than you do genius
Release the hot air, Sir!
Let me be the first to say, I care about your problems. But -
Don't believe my opponent's hot-headed ideas about climate change.
Behold!  Atlas Shrugged!!!!
Yes, I understand that my opponent has a world of knowledge but.....
Will you ever stop playing that rising seas victim card?!
I contend that the advanced age of my opponent renders her unfit for world leadership.
I don't see your point.
You and your ‘global perspective’ vastly underestimate the size of my ego!
My opponent is clearly trying to give this debate a hostile climate.
My opponent appears to have the weight of the world on his shoulders
The whole world is watching but hasn't yet said a word.
Excuse me. Excuuuse me! Let me finish before you overheat.
Tell me again why people in Australia don’t know they are upside down!
And our next speaker is Mother Earth who comes to tell us about  having too many hot flashes.
Sure, you speak for millions, but let’s not forget the little guy!
You say you have a world of evidence, but I have my opinions...
Behold, my opponent’s distorted view of the world .
And for our next TED talk...
Wait, wait! I promise no more denial about climate change!
Looks flat to me.
I have no earthly idea what you're talking about.
My opponent is somewhere out there trying to prove that he has a world view."
Look at my opponent, Alice, who is carrying the world on her shoulders. ALICE? Alice?
What about your affairs?
Where's your birth certificate? I'm not buying that God created the heavens and the earth fake news.
My opponent will have you believe that the world is not flat.
The poles show a 30 percent loss.
No wonder Atlas got tired of carrying you on his back.
...and all you’ll hear from this one is NIMBY !
If earth isn’t going to use all of its allotted time, I’ll continue..
Yes comrades, it's us against the world!
Atlas, come back here!
Who do you think you are?
At least we saved a life size model of our planet since it's too late to save the real thing.
That's fake news from the failing New York Times.  My opponent is flat and getting colder.
It's a costume! Don't be fooled. It's all flat underneath.
You,re not giving us the whole picture!
Im not the sun. Stop rotating.
Not exactly the correct answer but you're getting hotter....
As my esteemed colleague just found out, never turn your back on the Americas.”
Frankly, that argument falls flat.
My opponent has no plans for the future.
The world has finally decided to join us in our discussion.
Your scare tactics aren't working.
"Not only does my globalist friend want no border wall, he doesn't even want borders."
If you look very ,very carefully, you can see Fullerton, Nebraska.
No, you’re the one full of hot air!
Let me just say, it means the world to be here.
I  will lower my temper when you lower your temperature
And now let's hear from my opponent, Mother Earth.
Pick a language and stop spinning!
Wait a minute! I thought I was debating Ocasio-Cortez.
I'd like to start off by saying my opponent is a flat out liar.
Just because you’re the whole world it doesn’t make you right.
Unlike my opponent here, I am NOT a globalist!
The voters should note:  my opponent is only showing his best face to the audience!
Seems the world shrugged Atlas
Welcome to this evening's first presidential 2020 debate
For the last time - No! It's not getting warmer in here!
When this next speaker turns around, he really makes my day.
The planet wishes to be heard.
Earth, I studied Pluto. I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Pluto.
I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen but ICE just took Atlas away.”
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?
So, what's your stance on climate change?
The debate pitted Harry against the world.
This man is a phony! The real Earth is flat!
"The people need someone who won't  just turn the other hemisphere when things get rough.
How about a big round of applause for our next speaker?
Nice of the Earth to show up this evening. Especially with the ALLEGED reports that she’s dying. Fake news!
In conclusion, my learned opponent's claim that she is feeling 'warmer' is patently false.
I alone know the truth and the whole world is lying.
In my opinion, the speaker has a clear bias on the topic of climate change.
And may I introduce to you the best scientific expert in the world, Mother Earth!
There can be no debate here sir... You are indeed round!
On this global issue, the world will speak
Feels like you are on a different planet on this issue.
...Thank you for your input, Earth, but I’m afraid we’ll have to leave it there.
Yes, you Edith Perkins of 345 Glenn street in Boise, Idaho... your chance to rebut me.
In conclusion, all the evidence clearly establishes that the earth is flat.
One of those tiny dots in the middle might be Puerto Rico,it's hard to find and surrounded by water and far away.No collusion!
Who invited you?
I'm sorry, but we're not concerned with your opinion here.
Stop treating the space program like a personal affront!
I'm just saying that my comments regarding my opponent getting hotter were taken out of context.
Who are you going to believe?
Why do you keep insisting that your self-interest trumps mine?
You’re just another globalist!
I served with Planet Earth. I knew Planet Earth. Planet Earth was a friend of mine. Globe, you’re no Planet Earth.
And,I am happy to present our next speaker:  The World at Large.
Just cause you're hot doesn't mean Global Warming is real.
I won’t debate global warming with your Down Under in my face.
Oh yeah? You and what atmosphere?
You've made your point , but continuing to blame us will not solve the problem, will it.
Make the world go away!
My next guest is here to present her earth-shattering paper, ‘The reports of my flatness have been greatly exaggerated’
Why am I always up against the world?
We know you’ll think the world of next speaker.
So turn on the air conditioner like everybody else!
I didn't mean it.
You might represent the entire planet, but I can run circles around you in this debate.
The stage is set for world domination.
Let me guess, it’s gonna be ‘uge.
Please help me welcome our next guest, a personal favorite of mine, and I think you'll agree, one of the top hemispheres of all time!
I don't care what you say, I still think you're flat!
I only need $275 trillion to build a wall around it to keep out global warming!
My opponent, Atlas, couldn’t even bother to show up!
Global perspective? My socks are Chinese and my call girls are Brazilian, sir.
We'll have to put your issues on hold for the moment. Now, how about we discuss gerrymandering?
To make the case against eating more sardines, I now turn to my opponent, the Pacific Ocean.
There you go again.
Are you better off than you were four years ago?
I'm not impressed with your world view!
I know the world revolves around you, but please wait your turn.
Shouldn't that be 'I am the world'?
That may be your opinion, but I still say you are flat!
We’ll get to you later.
I will not cave into the intimidation of globalists!
Look, I regret it happened, OK? But, who needs all that coral, anyway?
Enough with the earthsplaining.
Up next is Mother Earth. She’s here to testify about women’s rights.
I'd like to introduce today's speaker on the topic, "What to do when people call you flat."
Hyperbole aside, I think we can BOTH speak to the global issues facing this election
My opponent surely cannot shrug off the fact that he is a Globalist.
And now Earth's response...
Around and around we go again.
Talk about a Me vs. The World moment, am I right?
My opponent clearly can't see the gravity of the situation.
In this debate, it is me against the world. Literally.
Earth: To the climate change deniers. Haha! So funny! You guys are killing me! No. I mean it. Literally. You ARE killing me.
Frank attempted to debate global warming, but the evidence was too overwhelming”..
You need to chill!
well, we put a wall there, a beautiful barrier there, a fence...
My opponent here does not believe that American jobs should be our #1 priority in 2020.  Sad!
And now in celebration of Earth Day, I give you...
My opponent is full of hot air about global warming.
...and my opponent is obviously blowing things way out of proportion.
My opponent has a one-sided view of the world!
And really, instead of blaming others, it's time you took responsibility for your situation"
We’re sorry, Mr. Atlas had a scheduling conflict but in his place...
Mother Earth, you can't just argue that I'm a man and therefore I wouldn't understand.
Our speaker has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
In closing, remember to sign up and support MEFA on your way out. Make Earth Flat Again
I didn’t realize my opponent would be speaking for herself.
So, you deny you’re getting warmer?
My opponent occupies an alternate universe.
It seems to be getting a little warm in here.
if there are no labels,how do we know where we are?
Here's what's happened because I didn't get my fence.
I assure you, you are not sick, there is no Climate change, now get back into your orbit where you belong.
Your arguments for globalism are a bit too self-centered.
Gee wiz, what are we standing on?
And here’s Atlas! Wait... Where’d he go?
Ahh, what do YOU know?
My opponent has no experience in government and is deluded by all the fake science supporting the global warming hoax.  And he's fat.
It still looks pretty flat to me!
Yeah, and what about Asia?
Nobody listens to you!
- People are not gonna buy this: a revolution every year it's not a real revolution!
Although my opponent is more worldly, I can see she's heating up right now!
I would ask my opponent to present evidence for this 'global warming'"
Flat, flat, flat—end of debate!
Do you need some ice in your water?
Please. Just speak one at a time.
There she goes again, always complaining about how warm it feels in here.
Here.s the latest Banana Republic. Let’s welcome the United States of America
Just because you represent the entire world doesn’t make you right.
#MeToo
Global warming? At her age? It's clearly hot flashes.
Folk, it's you and me against my opponent here.
I'll admit that my opponent has delivered on some of her promises...
Is it warm in here?
I know you're on a roll, but.....
My opponent is clearly orbiting around the issue here.
First you whined about the ozone layer, now it's climate change - what's next, disappearing rain forests?
Nobody cares if you're more respected on the world stage...I had a reality TV show
Donald embarrasses himself once again on the world stage.
My opponent is clearly melting under this heat
My opponent has his head in the clouds!
And my opponent - I call him "whiny world" - can't even tolerate a few extra degrees of heat....  Hey "genius globe" - ever hear of air conditioning?
Excuse me, but the Americas are not the only continents on the planet!
When I said Global Warming is not real it was not for debate!
Hold it right there. Asia and Australia won the coin toss fair and square."
It's about time you stood up for yourself!
It’s ‘All the world’s a stage’ not, ‘All the stage’s a world’!
OK, Defend yourself!
Yes, but do you have any actual proof that climate change is real?
I will not tolerate your circular arguments!
And now a word from our next speaker on climate change: The Planet
I prefer to remind my esteemed opponent that props are not permitted in formal debate.
I concede that the world does in fact revolve around my opponent.
I don't care which side you're on!
I mention "Hot Topic's" and you come rolling in !
I 'd like to introduce the ultimate expert on global warming, The Earth!
Why should we trust you? You keep changing your climate!
My opponent's world view is clearly 'America First'.
My opponent is not a scientist and has no basis for discussing climate change
As you can clearly see, ladies and gentlemen, we need LOTS of walls!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to buy into all this global warming stuff based on a single opinion.
My opponent thinks she knows so much about global warming!
now, we will hear from "Mother Earth" as she gives her point of view on the so-called "Climate Change" matter
Excuse me sir! I will continue to oppose your unabashedly globalist views, and I dispute that you have the weight of the world behind them!
From where I stand your climate seems fine.
My opponent's is a very one sided globalist perspective.
And now, live on our stage here at the EPA, and speaking for herself, a very angry WORLD
I know worlds. I have the best worlds!
And now, our special guest would like to discuss 
Armageddon and why it should happen now.
I will not make age an issue. I am not going to exploit my opponent's age and uncountable antiquations.
.....and that’s how far my inaugural crowd extended.
Name the missing lake
You're not so hot.
And that's what it looked like before it burned up.
Ha! You think you know more about climate change?
I propose we vote U.S. off the planet
Even more evidence that Atlas dropped the ball.
You make a very well rounded arguement
To my left on this side of the dais we have the current champion.
And I alone can fix it
Meanwhile, my opponent has referred to our entire species as ‘A basket of deplorables’!
It's obvious that my opponent is full of hot air.
Don't be such a hot head!
Listen to him, he just goes round and round...
My opponent always complains about carrying the weight of the world.
So that's your take on the world view?
The Flat Earth Debating Society has an invited guest speaker!
And now...may I introduce the elephant in the room...
And presenting the case against climate change ...
My opponent claims to have the whole world in his hands. Maybe he underestimated.
...my intelligence is not up for debate sir. Nor my ability see. The Flat Earth Society rejects your claims of roundness...
We get it !    You have a World-view of politics
what your saying makes a world of difference
But what are your domestic positions?
I don't care what you say, climate change is a hoax.
The plan speaks for itself.  Protect our Northern border.  Move the Great Lakes!
Excuse me Mr. President, but I can speak for myself.
Offering her rebuttal in the climate change debate, we welcome to the stage... Mother Earth!
And my ancestors lived in the upper left tip of earth back when it was habitable.
My fellow citizens, clearly my opponent is not the actual planet Earth; for if that were the case, I then ask you: where are we holding this debate?
‘The Americas this, the Americas that’ - I’ve had it with your Western Hemisphere-centrism!
The last thing we'd want is world dominance!
My opponent may well believe that she's warming, but has she considered whether it might just be psychosomatic?
What are you hiding? Show us your birth certificate!
And your questions about it's health...I'm going to let earth speak for itself.
I hear you, I hear you...but buying plastic water bottles is just too convenient
My opponent would like you to think he carries the world on his shoulders.
I know more about anything than anyone! And I certainly know more about so called global warming than you!
“There you go again blaming everyone but yourself.”
Even at this distance I don't feel you're any warmer.
I guess this really is the world stage
I beg your pardon, but the galaxy doesn't care.
Well I’ve been around the block a couple of times too, y’know.
My opponent may be heated, but I'm not convinced it's global warming...
How did you get in here?
You were flatter in your profile picture.
How did you fit through the door anyway?
Obviously, my opponent is guilty of self-aggrandizing
And now the Americas will have their say.
Closer, closer...okay...stop! Stop!
Excuse me, I'm talking!
I’ll say it again: ‘flat’.
My colleague and I are a universe apart on this point.
Stop Right There!  YOU don't believe in global warming?
You are too subjective about climate change.
I  suppose you have something to say about global warming !!
How can you not recognize the global dimensions of the problem?
Not only is there no global warming, but as you can plainly see, the world is flat!
And just why is it we should allow you to make your problems ours?
Don't be fooled by my opponent that "Size matters".
No collusion!  I swear!
Cool down, Earth. Climate change's a hoax.
And now, a rebuttal to the Flat Earth argument.
Nonetheless, the entire planet is still only entitled to a 90 second rebuttal.
Atlas Shrugged, ladies and gentlemen"
And if there is someone who knows a thing or two about global warming it is Earth.
My opponent has a world of ideas, but, will it be around long enough to deliver?
Nevertheless, your world-view is reductive.
He's just a puppet for a special interest group, his 7.5 billion constituents.
I'm not too old to debate you; I'm just warming up.
I'm sorry to say, but my debate opponent hasn't been able to withstand the pressures of the world.
So, our presentation for today: the earth is not flat. Any questions?
Just be patient. Atlas has a bit of a bladder problem.
Yeah, like, that's like your world view, man.
I am not adjusting the thermostat to accommodate your menopause.
Ok fine maybe you're not flat, but vaccines will definitely still give you autism"
"You're entire argument is an ad hominem."
Another self-centered remark from my opponent, always thinking globally!
And now, mother earth on her story on "How I survived in spite  of your abuse.
I don’t care if the earth rolled over him, my two minutes aren’t up yet!
I understand you've prepared a eulogy for the human race.
Look. there are still so many places to build Border Walls
Things are really heating up in this debate.
What would you know about global warming?
I will not uphold the world view.”
Who on earth are you?
See — it's flat!
Look who is finally warming up?
There is no such thing as global warming even if the whole world disagrees.
I’m sorry, madam, but you’ve had your turn and you’re out of time.
Globalism isn't as big as you think
I would like to address my comments to North America. No offense to you South America.
Despite my Mother's naivete, it is money that makes the world go 'round.
Welcome to the Flat Earther Debate Finals
You're so US-centric!
What planet are you on?!
''HERE IT IS FOLKS!  LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!"
You’re only in it for yourself.
I said I'd debate the Democrats, not the entire Western Hemisphere!
Contrary to popular belief, the world is not getting smaller.
This just proves that it's a world wide conspiracy.
If I even mention climate change, you get all heated.
This is not my middle finger.
You seem a little arrogant, do you think the world of  yourself?
I deny that!
My opponent will selfishly ask you to make him better.
You’re just pandering to your base!
We've brought the world into the classroom to speak to you directly.
My opponent, Mother Earth, is a bully, just like all climate alarmists!
My opponent considers himself worldly!
Hypochondriac!
Quit changing the clima... er,uh,subject!
And what exactly have YOU done for us lately?
Just goes to show you can't always trust your Global Positioning System
And now, the most recent addition to the Democratic Party's
primary, Gaia!
You, sir, are not seeing the larger picture!"
I've found my opponent lacks perspective."
I don't care if the world is against me. I shall prevail!
Excuse me! I have the floor.
Yeah, Atlas, just walk away and leave her to the rest of us ...
Your presentation here today means the world to us.
As my worthy opponent knows, This problem is bigger than both of us!
And it makes a certain amount of sense that the world would finally ask for equal time...
My opponent is just another globalist.
Is anybody listening?
And we've had it up to here with those volcanoes.
And now for an opposing view
This debate is getting very heated
I challenge my opponent to produce her long-form Hawaiian birth certificate!
Now that we've seen the satellite photo of the Great Wall of China, here's what The Trump wall looks like from the same distance.
This was meant to be a tempered debate. Stop getting so heated.
Still alive, this year’s life achievement award goes to...
Do you have proof of these outlandish claims?
And finally, where in the world is my opponent?
Atlas shrugged.
Is my opponent prepared tonight to admit that they have another hidden side to their identity?
There is no debating this; you are full of hot air
As you can see, our distinguished guest is having hot flashes.
I served with Carl Sagan. I knew Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Carl Sagan.
And now I turn the podium over to the Pacific Ocean which will present thoughts of it’s global dominance of Earth’s surface area.
Just keep your center of gravity
Well, from here you look pretty darn flat to me!
Apparently my opponent cannot carry the weight of the world on his shoulders after all.
And now, to give an opposing view on the question of global warming...
Let’s keep it real, no one cares that much about you.
Let me guess.  Location, Location, Location."
I'd just like to point out that you are letting Easter Island speak for an awful lot of people.
There you go again. Blowing even hotter air than last time we met.
That's the planet we escaped from.
I think we'd all like to hear from your better half.
Please tell us how Climate Change is affecting you.
My next guest needs no subduction.
I’m gonna build a wall!
Where not here to talk about your personal issues, ma'am.
No! I will not be intimidated by globalization anymore.
Oh yeah ... well, you're fat.
My opponent cannot prove it is round!
And here's a shout-out to my family in Des Moines
When the earth was flat we had none of the problems we have now. If you ventured astray, you just fell off.
About time you stopped spinning.
Vote for ME!  
I am the only candidate willing to take on the WORLD!
If we elect this guy we are in for a world of hurt!
Moving South America east
we can stop global warming.
Stop hovering, you creep.
Global inflation is getting out of hand.
Before I begin my talk, I want to thank my staff  for this terrific visual aid.
Who are you going to believe? Me, or her?
My opponent says he's "warming." I say, that's HIS problem.
This is what it looked like before it went flat.
With all due respect, you're in no condition for the job.
And you really expect us to believe you’re not flat?
The time has come to change up the Miss World competition
Get a load of ol' "Low Energy Earth," over there.
Folks, I know some of you won't believe how fast our next speaker was able to warm up!
As you can see,there is no wall there anywhere!  If God wanted a wall there, he would have put a wall!
_I move to recess until Mr.Atlas resolves his egregious theatrics.
Okay,Okay, Climate change is real!!
Oh, sure! You’ve ‘changed’...
While my opponent may better portray the populous at large, I would like to point out that I am rich.
I realize I may be alone with my opinion on this issue."
My oponent thinks she knows something about climate change.
I begin my argument with an extraterrestrial world view.
Raymond's worldly opinion of himself before the debate was short lived.
Ask not what the world can do for you!
How long we have endured, the spin from the other side.
What? YOU?!
YOU  have NO Say in this!
Shut up and SIT Down!
We're giving each of the seven and a half billion speakers five minutes, then we'll open the cocktail party.
You never hear Mars complaining like this!
Climate Change? Ha! Show me the evidence.
I, for one, am not aligned with your world view.
You may have all the time in the world, but I need 30 seconds for a rebuttal.
We warned you the camera would add ten pounds!
Please hold your applause as this tends to start rolling.
Why should you be the one determine the correct thermostat setting?!
This Pacific point my opponent raises is a good one.
I'd rather talk about unemployment.
Yes, we think life is possible on Planet Earth, but understandably, very low intelligence.
Well if you can warm up, so can I.
Don't turn your back on me!
I can fix this and upper Mongolia will pay for it!
And you cast out poor Pluto, who was so small, weak and frail
And what would you know about global warming?
My opponent would like to build a wall to keep Pluto out...
Objection! the question is out of orbit and without spin.
Did it ever occur to you that it could just be global hot flashes?
Damn you, Atlas!
Give it up. The whole world is against you.
Uh, woah there! When we promised you a global presence, this wasn't exactly what he had in mind.
It's always on a macro level with you.
Our guest lecturer will be discussing global warming.
And just what have you ever done for the people?
I will prove that global warming is a hoax despite my opponent's hot-headed arguments to the contrary!
It's now the planet's turn.
My friend Atlas here apparently got tired!
I can see our debate from here!
While Mr. Blue Planet would shackle your economic freedom
I, Donald tRump, call this global warming garbage FAKE News!  I’ll say it right to your face!
My opponent is NOT being transparent concerning global warming - he's only showing half of the story!
Western hemisphere...you ignorant slut!
My opponent would have you believe she  feels the pain of global warming more then I do?
My client, the former planet known as Pluto is requesting damages from the defendant....
You may have the science, but we've got Trump!"
There- right there is where the wall will be if you vote for me.
Will you stop your whining. What did you think? You would live forever?
That’s just your opinion
The victim card is the only thing my opponent knows to play.
No, I’m not mansplaining.
You haven't much time. Better make it bruef.
I don't think you're big enough to matter.
My colleague here appears to be getting hot under the collar, despite my reasonable argument in this debate that there is no scientific  evidence of climate change.
The earth speaks and no one listens.
I think the world of my esteemed opponent, however...
My opponent, who takes a broader view...
Bah to your preponderance of proof!  You'll never convince me you're not flat!
And I say you're not warming. I guess it's my word against yours.
So you think you can be a star
Just stopped in to issue a global warning
I told you that unlike myself, Senator Atlas would crumble under the additional weight of his presidential candidacy.
Mother Earth, may I call you 'Mom'? You've heard all sides of the climate change debate. We'd like to hear from you. Speak up, Mom.
That’s my opponent...always spinning.
It's about time you weighed in on global warming!
My opponent is not taking the bigger picture into account!
See ladies and gents!
The "Lie-entists" were wrong again. 
It's perfectly flat, like "Plate-O" said.
And, right at the geometric center.....
Mar-El-Lago!
Your argument is flat sir, and so are you!
Yes, but can you really prove it was HUMAN activity that caused your warming?
Hold on Atlas!
Your World View and mine are definitely different.
Our next speaker needs no introduction.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Everybody.
It's starting to feel warm in here.
The new dwarf planet, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.0167, will now take questions.
Does my opponent agree that there are two sides to every story?
Tonight, we are here to debate our world view.
Our next speaker has a real earthy sense of humor.
I know the Earth and you are not her, ma'am.
My opponent clearly knows nothing of worldly affairs.
I think it's just the stage lights. You're not actually warming.
I'm not here to chit chat about the weather.
Mother Earth wouldn't even be in the presidential arena if she weren't a woman.
I STILL say that my opponent is FLAT!
We present to you the finest speaker on the planet to talk to you on climate change.
It’s a hoax! Last summer my opponent didn’t even have ice on her forehead!
As Tupac once said: “it’s Me Against the World.”
Before we continue our debate on Climate Change... can you please provide a long form birth certificate?
...and the world has spoken!
Contrary to what some may claim or believe, the world is in fact round. I present to you Exhibit A.
You seem very worldly, what's your opinion on global warming?
I still say you're flat, and you don't feel any warmer than you did the last time we met.
I am an expert on global warming, so please wait your turn before weighing in on the issue.
Our next guest is a world-renowned geologist
If you're going to be like that, we'll just move to Planet B.
And I am indeed ready to take on the world."
John Canning
Sea Cliff, NY
And yet my opponent promised to drain the swamps!
As a representative of the oil industry, let me repeat: we won’t be intimidated!
My opponent continues to duck questions on domestic issues.
Hah! You call me a gas bag?
I did say I was ready to take on the whole world, but could I go to the bathroom first?
Don't give us that face. Everyone knows you've been warming up to China.
Sir, do you mind? I’m just as interested in climate change as you.
My next guest is here to discuss global warming. 
Let's give a warm welcome to Earth.
Atlas I knew you would never hold up
Before long, things will completely turn for you
easy...I was just kidding about global warming being fake news...
I’mBlue; I’m hot; and I won’t be ignored
My opponent recently confided that she IS feeling a bit warmer.
What on earth are you saying ?!
Sure, I may not be the most worldly candidate.
As parliamentarian of the Flat Earth Society, you, sir, are very much out of order.
Somehow the continents separated from one another, if you catch my drift.
And arguing the "against" position in today's debate, please welcome Senator Mitch McConnell.
Your answer to my question is still wrong, but you are getting a little warmer.
Planet, I served with Jupiter. I knew Jupiter. Jupiter was a friend of mine. Planet, you’re no Jupiter!
I know this is a debate, but you have to stop getting so heated!
My opponent’s lying! Promising the world? Just look at him!
Whoa... easy there big fella.... let me introduce you first !
Not now, Mother. I'm trying to sell these fine folks a border wall.
You say 'global warming,'  but what do you really know about it.
Alright, let's put a pin in it.
There he goes. Throwing his weight around again.
I'd like to point out that my party's constituants own, or otherwise directly control, ninety-eight percent of my opponent.
How does it make you feel when people say they want to change you?
yeah? well you're fat
...and my ever-vacationing opponent is even now somewhere in the Pacific.
How can we believe that you speak on behalf of everyone?
There you go, getting all hot and steamy again!
All I said was we deserve better than Uranus.
Wait a minute! You're not the only one to have a global approach.
Okay, you win, global warming is a real thing!
Don’t even go there! I was eco-friendly before they invented the word.
My opponent has a long history of 
only circling the larger issues.
Stop right there - talk to the hand!
And I say if Earth Day were a real holiday, we’d get the following Monday off!
STOP! I DON'T ACTUALLY CONSIDER MYSELF THE CENTER OF UNIVERSE.
And that’s my position even if the whole world thinks I’m crazy!
Just you wait, my opponent will come around.
How can you, of all people, deny global warming?
I don't care what the world says. I have all the answers.
I shall defend the use of fossil fuels even though the whole world oppose me.
Oh yeah?!  Well I‘ve got Wisconsin
Fake news!
You can't prove it!
Ask yourself, why hasn't Earth released its long form brith certificate?
You say we have to think globally...I say we must act locally.
We are worlds apart on this issue.  Let’s just agree to disagree.
Unlike my opponent I have a world view.
Wait one revolution now!
Please shut off your phones and GPS devices.
And now let me introduce my very dear,old friend without whom I certainly would not be here tonight.
Mother Earth, do you believe Climate Change is a hoax?
What is your opinion on global warming?
It's been said that I'm at odds with the world.
Neither charm nor gravity will make me take your side!
You shift positions so much you’re practically spinning
While my opponent may be more worldly, my spin is that politics is local.
Man V. World
My opponent, Mr. World, will try to say that it's all gloom and doom ahead.
Oh yeh, keep blabbering about YOUR molten core!
My opponent seems to think global warming is the only issue of interest here.
And my opponent just fell into the Pacific!
My opponent claims to be from the Western Hemisphere.....I ask you where’s the proof?
World debating championship
That "Atlas Shrugged" story is getting pretty old!
Care to spin around and show us your poorer side?
I've invited my next guest to talk about it's next revolution
Our extinction may well be at hand, but there was no collusion!
.......and my opponent's presents a view that only shows a New World perspective".
Earth, heal thyself!
We will secure our borders from climate change too
From now on, America first!
And now, a representative of the Earth has asked to say a few words about global warming, pollution, and basic lack of respect.
This is a science convention.  There is no need for your worldview.
Where's my wall?!?
Yes, I Donald J. Trump, know better. My gut says so...
I'm warning you!
...and I still have more Twitter followers!
You want a whole day?? How would we pay for it?
Your perspective is too broad.
My title for this lecture is "The Rise of Globalism"
I don't care what the World says, global warming is a hoax!
I call on my opponent to stick to the issues.
No Climate Change! Who ya gonna believe, Me, your favorite 
Pres ever, or Fat fake Blue Boy over there?
Earth, you're no Jack Kennedy.
I'm feeling anything but global warming from you.
Okay! Okay! Hold your water!
My opponent here seems to think science is a thing!
It's like I have the weight of the world going against me!
Yeah, when you can't think of anything better to say it's always, "Global Warming this and Global Warming that"
No. I said, ‘Please be more SPECIFIC. ‘
No no no! Only from there to there will be great again.
My opponent makes unsubstantiated claims of global warming. We all know she is just having hot flashes!
We are the last two candidates and the choice is clear.
I pledge to bring back the borders
Not being able to speak about climate change made The World even hotter under the collar.
And now, here to discuss the climate crisis, we have the Western Hemisphere.  The East will appear tomorrow and for many days thereafter.
Our next speaker for Earth Day, is the Earth y'all!
I'm pleased to introduce our newest democratic candidate with a can-do attitude and getting warmer every day...
He's not letting me get a world in edgewise.
The only thing getting heated is this debate!
That may be so, but what about the Eastern Hemisphere?
There you go again Mother Earth. I may be sleazy, but that's not where I was coming from when I said you were hot.
Give me a podium, and I will move the world!
My opponent claims to know a whole world about climate change.
My opponent has abandonded the simple modesty of cloud cover, is no longer spinning about any meaningful axis, has deserted his loving moon and solar siblings, and his butt is permanently parked on top of Australia.  He is a small shadow of his past.
Meanwhile he just spins around, gravitating toward any hot, shiny thing in the sky.
Those dots in the middle are called islands.  They're underwater now.
What would you like to say to all these people putting trash into you?
Power Point is so passé
I would now like to address all the "fake news" being generated my opponent.
What do you mean, EVERYBODY says so?
your position simply does not hold water
When it comes to climate change, it’s me against the world.!
If you can wait a minute I believe that I have the lever that works with that fulcrum.
And no booing, just because our next speaker believes in climate change.
It's hard being the down-to-earth candidate
If we can just capture what the earth is trying to tell us.....
Enough with the climate change!
The planet has something to say.
Want a Coke? Then show me you can sing in perfect harmony!
THEY say the earth is flat and I believe they are correct.
What do you mean another universe has adopted you?
You think you’re so great.
My opponent can't even sit still.
If my opponent is scaring you, he's just warming up.
Ask yourself, how can you trust my opponent who has killed billions of innocents throughout history?
Now let's draw lines.
And now we will from a source that has a vested interest in Global Warming,
Says you...
this debate makes a world of difference.
Whoa! Back up there! If you can't stand the heat ...
You're way too down to Earth.
My opponent is obviously a member of the globalist left.
I’ll concede my opponent has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
If you’re down here, then who’s up there?”
I know you're passionate, Mom, but you have to sit in the audience!
And I suppose you are going to take a world view on this issue
Behold! My base!
My view is quite different
Taking on the world? No, you're taking on Mortie Applebaum.
You DON'T represent the global community!  Can you even spell, 'Herzegovina'?  I CAN!!"
What're you gonna do? Flatten me?
And I say, cargo shorts are a timeless classic!
And in closing I ask: Do mothers always know best?
Even though you think you're round, my supporters and I know you are fat. . .I mean flat.
From day one, my opponent has done everything in his power to conceal his ties to Russia.
Very nice! Now turn and show Europe.
I’d like to ask my opponent if they have ever been to Hell, and if they in fact own a hand basket.
and now for the majority opinion...
I'm a proud nationalist!  Can my opponent say the same?
What in the world are you doing here?!!
And yet you stand there silent!
Loser"
I'm just the man to take on the world.
That’s weather, not climate!
Just water weight?  Talk about spinning the truth!
And, our next speaker is
Hemi Sphere.”
I'm just warming up, so you can stop right there.
Accepting the award for best known solar system in the galaxy...
Ned surprised everyone with his earthy sense of humor.
Wait, wait, let me finish.
We can't trust you to not rotate your view.
And to prove the earth is flat, I brought the impostor herself.
My opponent may lead you to believe that she's big and mighty, but when you go to the polls, you must remember: It's a small world, after all.
I understand we’re on a global stage, but it’s just your opinion.
The president indicated you were flat.
The Earth would like to say a couple of words to Mankind."

"You're Screwed!
I will not be intimidated!
Oh stop it and just cool down will you.
That's fine for you, but what about Africa? And Europe! And Asia! And Greenland! And Antarctica! Yeah! What about Antarctica?
The people can't trust you on climate change—you're a biased party!
As you can see, it is a disk, and therefore flat.
What on earth would you have me do?!
I know that you're a big advocate for No More Humans, but you'll have to wait to speak like everyone else
This is a tad bigger than that proverbial  elephant in the room.
And you see Dora the Explora now is approaching the Orinoco
Calling us stupid doesn’t help.
We knew something would render Trump non-existent.  And it was there all  this time.
Ok, so maybe my opponent IS round after all. But there's still no consensus on his ‘global warming’ claim!
Get Man to Mars! That’s your answer to everything!
If your temperature goes up a mere 2.8 degrees centigrade you call it a disaster! Even I can handle that! What a wimp!
There you go again, whining about your Doomsday Clock.
I said wall, not ball!
With that, I am done ... and the only thing standing between you and lunch is The World.
Again, I'll restate my position. The evidence isn't yet conclusive."
So stop getting so overheated, already!
This position calls for someone with more stability than you and your incessant climate change can offer.
Plainly, my opponent thinks it speaks for everyone.
No need to get overheated, it's a long campaign.
Some say the planet is telling us we are causing it to overheat. We are going to debate that today.
See this pin?    Lighten up.
and, ladies and gentleman, here to answer your questions about global warming, is, er , the globe.
My opponent will try and tell you she isn't flat and that she has a fever.
Do not be dissuaded by my opponent's OverHeated rhetoric!
My opponent would lead you to believe that he has taken a world view, but it is clear to see that he has drawn Alaska incorrectly.
Don’t you stare at me like that!
The last thing our planet needs is refugees from Earth.
May I introduce you to Mr. Splat, who some of you knew as Atlas.
We invited people here to talk about the planet. Not the planet to talk about people.
The people deserve a leader who can stay cool under pressure!
Okay, what on Earth happened to the other speaker?
You can debate all you want about curvature and the masts of ships disappearing below the horizon.  But I know in my heart that you are flat.
Hang on, I'm going to get Jupiter.
There’s more to debate than which candidate has the most gravitas!
You say "turtles all the way down" but you have no legs to stand on.
Keep your geopolitical opinions to yourself!
I figured that in due course the whole world would speak against me.
If elected I promise to investigate why my opponent is no longer FLAT!
Stop the World, I wanna get...no, right, I’m already off.
Join me in holding my opponent responsible for the mess we're in.
This is a global warning!
The debate on global warming heats up"
Speak for yourself!
Addressing the Elephant in the Room...
You are so flat!
I knew the world and you are no world!
Do you have anything you'd like to say before we decide?
Not in my hemisphere!"
Clearly, my opponent cannot carry the weight of the world on his shoulders
No rolling over just to make a point.
And my opponent just goes on and on and on."
No, it’s not caused by CO2 emissions. It’s the house lights.”
So who are you going to believe? Me or them?
My opponent is an old, sick globalist who wasn't even born in America.
If you're truly who you say you are, then where does that leave us?
Believe me, you're no Jack Kennedy
Despite what my opponent would have you believe, being worldly is not enough.
No, no!  Flat, flat, flat!
Well, uh......at least I'm not 96% salt water!!
The Earth is really flat I tell you......FAKE NEWS!!
I know the whole world says I'm wrong, but I say I'm right
It’s obvious that my opponent is not well- rounded.
The Flat Earth Society vehemently objects to your characterization of our position as being 'anti-Pythagorus.'
Fake views!
I have been wrongfully accused by the Fake News of “trashing” my opponent
No one knows more about the planet than I do.
Forget the wall - build a canal!
I don't doubt that you may have been molested. But the statute of limitations. . .
And now..let’s here it for someone who needs no introduction..here to tell us what’s happening everywhere..and we mean everywhere
And my opponent would have us all return to the Cenozoic Era.
My opponent—now in its 4.5 billionth year—is Exhibit A for term limits.
Thank you for stopping by on your global health tour, and we appreciate your tip on retaining water.
My opponent just told you a world of lies!
I see that my time has expired.
Uh, no. You’re flat.
I’m the best president ever! The world’s all wrong and I’m always right!
Of course the world is round, but this proves it is not a globe.
Even the Earth, the 2018 Debate World Champion, can not negate Climate Change
Please, no more global perspective.
Another one of my opponent’s dirty tricks - he’s trying to convince you that all of America is against me!!
Excuse me Mother, but my opinion on global warming is JUST as important as yours
I will not be intimidated into accepting man-made climate change.
Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!
You are a hoax!
We couldn't decide who to invite to speak so we invited the whole world
I still choose to BELIEVE the Earth is flat.
In a word, this next speaker is worldly.
And for a global opinion...
Oh yeah? Well. look at these hands!
I thought the rules said no props?
Now for someone who speaks for a lot of us, I'm sure...
Our tax cuts should be trickling down to you any day now
How do you know global warming exists?
Can you be more specific?
So, why is it still snowing then?
Quit bullying us with floods, hurricanes and tornadoes! Carbon emissions are not the problem. You are!
If you listen closely to the rhetoric, you can almost feel the weight of the world upon you.
Debating Trump in this debate -the world.
I must dispute the assertions of my deluded opponent: it has been demonstrated time and again that only the Republican Party knows what’s best for the planet Earth.
No, it's not getting warm in here.
Told you I wasn't flat!
I prefer my planets red, white and blue!
Do me a favor and show us your more civilized side.
.... and you should be able to tell that I think the world of my opponent.
Enough with the hemispherics!
Fake news, anyone can say there’re round.
...and my opponent changes his climate as often as the rest of us change underwear!
Now it is time to hear from everyone!
Thank you for inviting me here today. Reminds me of that time some 65 million years ago...
What proof does my opponent here really have about global warming?
It’s just me against the world now, baby!
Well if global warming is real, then why is it so cold in here?"
You may have a world of ideas, but your argument is flat!
With all due respect, senator, where I come from it is not a crime to think locally."
It's true, I think the world of you.
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. . . You’re no Jack Kennedy.”
Now, to present the other side of the argument...
Now, from our West Hemisphere correspondent...
I don't care about 'your'
 pronoun, you are dressed as "Mother Earth"!
It's broke and I'm the only one who can fix it. It'll be great, believe me.
It's just the world against me!
When I win this election I'll be on top of my opponent.
My opponent is, in fact, flat!
Welcome to tonight's discussion on climate change.
You can’t hide forever Mr. President.
Mind if I smoke?
Oh, it's always about you, isn't it, Mr Global Warming.
I say to my followers. Sometimes it seems the whole world is against us......
Melvin joins the Flat Earth debate
Yes ever since the Panama Canal, South America has been drifting east.
That may very well be true, but tell me this - how many Twitter followers do YOU have?
...and I promise to focus on issues closer to home
Atlas is under there somewhere ...
My opponent just THINKS it hot in here.
I heard I was competing against a world class debater!
My opponent, the globe, will tell you that global warming is real, and largely caused by human behaviors.  The globe is all wet in its opinion"
My opponent only tells the truth when it's convenient for her.
You’re taking this personally.   I have data.
Fake News!! Don't listen to my hot-headed adversary.
We know you're coming to an end but can you wait so we can film it?
You can't change my mind! You're still flat to me!
The oceans have so much to tell us. Pacific, what have you got to say?
So, you think you know more about climate change? Think again.
And here, to make Wittgenstein's point, is the world.
So you say - but what about the eastern hemisphere?
And I say, your 'personal experience' with global warming is fake news! MAGA!
I'm here to remind you that this issue is real, and it's no small matter.
Welcome to Twitter Live! Round 1: the world vs. a man who read something online.
Hey, Earth! Hovering behind people on a stage is my shtick, I made that up! Quit acting like everything revolves around you!
Whoa,  I was told one guy would be taking the climate change is real side!
Since three quarters of you is water, I’d hardly say that you represent the ‘entire planet.’
And then the world turned on me ...
This really shouldn’t be a debate
Heeerrr’s Earth!!!
Global warming is not real — my opponent is just a hypochondriac
I do think the world of you.
Is it getting hot in here?
My response to you is that you are full of hot air!
You need to chill out.
And now it is my honor and pleasure to introduce one who needs no introduction, Mother Earth!
Yes sir, I do believe I am more important than you and all of your inhabitants.
The world may not agree with me about climate change....
Yeah well, speaking for myself.
Today our guest psychiatrist will deliver a lecture on the continental self
I don’t KNOW why we can’t all just get along”..
Her argument that climate change is real is totally biased.
The world has its way of doing things, and I have my way. The world makes Hurricanes to destroy and kill, while I make Hurricanes with lots of rum.
And so we kick off "Farewell Tour 2019!"
Being 'down to earth' doesn't make him right.
And who is this 'source' that will back these outrageous claims?
Let me stop you right there.. "Planet B" cannot possibly be a legitimate proposal.
A boastful earth will now put its own spin on things.
My opponent is taking a one-sided view of this global challenge.
Earth,  I knew Uranus. Uranus was a friend of mine. Planet, you're no Uranus.
Notice the white areas?
They will soon be under water.
You, sir, are nothing but fake news.
It’s not about you.
Enough with the climate change – these dramatic temperature shifts you're experiencing are just global menopause.
And so I ask again: Do you really want a Flat-Earther as your candidate?
Climate change is a total hoax.  Let the world be my judge.
My opponent brings a behemothic ego to the debate.
Can you chill out please!
I don’t believe in global bullying!
.... and now for another perspective ....
There you go again. Climate, Shmimate. Blah, blah, blah.
Just because you mean the world to people...
And I repeat, even if the whole world should disagree with me, I know in my gut what is true and what is fake news.
Hello, Folks. Tonight's first guest is a prop comic known the world over for his many humorous and absurd creations. Let's have a big hand for God!
What in the world are you talking about?
Until today, folks, we've had to guess what our planet really needs......
If you cant stand the heat you need to stay out of politics!"
Mediator: “The topic of debate will be global warming.”
Who are you to lecture me about global warming?
Do you feel that Global Warming is overblown?
And now, from the other side of the aisle, let's hear from someone speaking on the effects of climate change.
I'm curiously attracted to you.
Thanks Al, I’ll take this one
You don"t intimidate me...I'm used to being the underdog!"
My opponent is flat wrong!
And, as you can see, the Americas have an obesity problem.
There is no debate. Make Earth Great Again!
Is it just me, or is it globally warm in here?
Who wants this genuine Earth rock for 25 moon rocks, do I hear 50?  50 going once, 50 going twice.  Sold! to the little man with the fashionable wave.
...additionally, my opponent has done nothing to stop global warming.
I was told my opponent would be flat
And while you may be warming to a new reality, I'm afraid you remain the very definition of a globalist.
I'll pause now to let the data speak for itself.
Stay in your orbit!
It doesn't matter what the world wants, it matters what we want
Could we turn on the air conditioning? It's getting hot in here.
Hope you had a chance to warm up before this!
Can we stick to one topic?
Oh ... just cool it!
Stop rolling, please.
Hold on now, that's a lot to put on my shoulders.
Unlike my opponent, I will think globally but act locally.
I object to how much of the stage my opponent is using.
can i finish?!? thank you... what the world fails to recognize, is her responsibility in all of this.
Don't blame me! I believe in climate change!
Mother Earth is joining us today to discuss her plans for our future.
As you can see, my opponent's global perspective remains 
uni-hemispheric.
If only the planet could talk.
The world will definitely have its say, just wait your turn.
I'd like to introduce my oyster, The World.
My opponent may THINK he's ready for the world stage.....
Dude, I have the numbers.
No, you're NOT warming.  And what do you mean, "This isn't a debate"?
I ask you - who are you going to believe?
Socialism isn’t the solution, but you’re getting warmer.
the world owes me, and I demand an answer
Unlike my opponent, I promise NOT to represent the interests of all.
And here to debate in favor of First World Problems...
Rumor has it that you're hoping for another meteor hit.
Just answer the question Mother Earth, when will you release your taxes?
You may claim you’re getting warmer, but it’s only fair that I’m allowed to present the other side.
Earth is only here because it's been riding on the back of Atlas forever."
A world without borders
...and I expect all of you to pay for your share of the Wall!
No, I still say that you are flat!
Speaking of inflation...
Today I'll be speaking for the world.
...and now, Mother Earth is here to lecture us on climate change.
Keep going around in circles.
As an atheist I challenged God to be here for a debate, He couldn't make it but sent proof He exists.
Again, my opponent Earth exaggerates. Global Warming is a myth.
My opponent's world view is solipsistic!
I know a thing or two about the world too, you know.
COME DOWN HERE AND DEBATE ME LIKE A MAN.
(These New Yorker cartoonist have it backwards, last week they had soup spinning and this week the world at a stand)
While I’ll cede to your roundness of shape, I’ve yet to see any evidence of your getting warmer.
Welcome nonbelievers to the Flat Earth World Debate!
I think the world of my opponent but clearly she is confusing her menopausal hot flashes with a global warming.
It appears my opponent takes their stance on climate change rather seriously.
May I point  out that my opponent may be geographically sound but he remains geologically in constant flux.
Now that you are off my shoulders, can you carry your own weight?
What do you know?  You’re mostly covered by water!
You think you're the whole world, but you're not. Tierra del Fuego is missing.
Can’t get a world in edgewise
There, right there, thanks to God and Donald Trump, is the greatest nation on the planet!
Now let's hear from the perspective of the Earth
Oh, so I suppose you think this make you an expect on climate change."
While my opponent here is going to try to argue climate change is 'real,' let me tell you about my tax plan.
Our next speaker has the whole world in his hands.
A political candidate with this world view is uncommon.
Someone please quickly lower the microphone for Mr. Atlas. He is much shorter than we expected!
And I told my wife, Melania, that it's mine, all mine.
What my opponent just said is pure geocentric poppycock.
And now, with a rebuttal . . .
Take the western hemisphere, for example...
America is bigger and better than you!
Our guest lecturer, Professor Atlas, had to step out for a moment, but he’ll be right back to finish his talk on 
Back Pain in Ancient Greece.
And that is why the earth is flat.
Are we really going to let this inarticulate blob rule our politics?
Just because you’re my mother!
Ok, calm down. One at a time!
And I'm happy to call climate change out as a hoax no matter how much evidence there is for it
Earth! You're all wet
It's taken them 4.5 billion years to show us their climate change plan. I'm only asking for 1 term.
My opponent is too round, too plump, and too worldly 
to be taken serious!
Turn around and show the voters your backside.”
Read my lips: no blue planets.
Let me reconsider my position on Climate Change.
The turning point was the debates. Nixon looked sweaty, nervous and untrained. Kennedy, by contrast, was tanned and calm— but also colossal and globular, with great tidal seas and continents and ice caps and everything.
I rest my case
The opposition candidate acts like a big shot, but can’t take the heat.
My Mother is always blowing things out of proportion.
Fake News! Earth has a well-documented left-wing bias!
Wait a minute - I’m the one whose supposed to warm up the crowd.
Four and a half billion is still too young for perpetual hot flashes.
Can you prove you aren't flat?
And now the fraction of the world that remains will tell you what  really happened to the rest of it.
We of the GOP, rebuke your histrionic claims of global warming!
If it is so hot in here then tell me why it snowed last week?
And yet my opponent has the audacity to question my membership in the Flat Earth Society!
Not the global warming argument again!
Speaking for the Eastern Hemisphere...
Fake news - the earth is actually flat!
I don't even wear carbon shoes. Next question.
We all have that weight on our shoulders!
And I too have personal experience with climate change
My opponent is well rounded, but that argument fell flat
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
And my opponent here...Lyin hot Mother Earth
That is fake news! Global warming is a myth!
Now, that's no reason to heat up!
Next Up to our Podium..Someone who has be "Round" a long time and has a "world" of knowledge".
Now you tell me who's responsible for all of the earthquakes?
Borders? What borders?
Presenting...for the first time on this stage... the World tour!
Prove it.
Atlas(t), an admitted globalist!
I disagree, the political climate takes precedence."
I, on the other hand, would like to take a more down to earth approach.
Your position is one-sided.
'Mother, I promise you'll have the last word'
Yes, I'm trying to turn the heat down!
Quit melting down! Think about the economy.
I'd like to thank my host...
"Excuse me!We are not here to discuss personal problems."
What do you mean "you're just another species"?
Claiming the debate was rigged, the Flat Earth proponent complained bitterly that his opponent should have been disqualified.
My therapist told me I was paranoid when I said you were always against me.
No global warming here folks! Move along...
You can think what you want to, but I'm acting locally.
That's just, like, your opinion, rest of the entire world.
Sorry!  Humans are in charge.  You have no say in the matter.
Hold up”...I said global warming, not warning!
Get outta my space!
Point taken on the coming big climate change.
I find your arguments on global warming to be unsubstantiated and frankly rather circular.
Sisyphus, I know you can hear me. Back off!
Look, lady, I have just as much experience and knowledge about climate change.
And NOW, with a medley of tunes from South Pacific..
Are you sure it’s not one of your hot flashes?
She can say all she wants about rising temperatures and seas, but I made a snowball in April, so what does that tell you?
We originally invited Pluto,but since it’s status changed ,the little people protested”
I respect your position, but you're taking climate change too personally
Yeah, that’s just your opinion.
Who are you kidding?  Stop the debate!  Everyone knows the earth is flat, and that climate change isn’t real.
Equal time! I was promised equal time!
Other than regularly occurring natural disasters, my opponent remains entirely silent on the issue of climate change.
I am not short! I am just more down to earth than most people!
Whoa!  Slow your roll, big guy.
Me against the World  and I still say you're flat.
And what have you ever done for us?
The Earth is flat.
Global warning? Don’t be a drama queen!
Now to tell us about the problems of the world  is the world !!
May I ask our U.S colleague to explain his views of the world.
Don't let the blue fool you. My candidate is in it for the green!
Introductions are unnecessary.  Her stage presence is global.
I do not believe, sir, that you are feeling any warmer”
Ok, so you feel a little bit warmer...but how do we know it's caused by humans?
In the eye of the beholder, you are a mere blimp in the universe.
I think the world of my opponent, but he has really failed to grasp the vital concept of national boundaries.
I think we should let Australia speak for herself!
I'm sorry I said you were flat!
Henderson never stood a chance at the Globalization debate.
Mr. Earth, in last night’s debate we heard a totally opposite opinion.
See?  It's always all about him!
And here's what it looked like, only 15 years ago.
I have crushing news!
Hey, when do we get the non-global warming questions?
And I say, let’s give the whole world a platform with which to speak.
The world is flat.
And my opponent insists the issue is global!
I know they said this was a global stage, but...
You could have just told the speaker under you that you had a comment.
ATLAS! ATLAS! Oh Atlas...
Wow,wow, wow, I believe you've exceeded your time limit.
Motherhood aside, what else can you say for yourself?
America, please take a spin and let someone else speak.
For the last time, where are you hiding Ms. San Diego?
Apparently, the 800lb gorilla in the room has something to say....."
Please wait your turn.
….and what makes you think, we 1% will listen you you?
Not now.
Atlas shrugged!  Is there an altruistic doctor in the house?
In this debate, the earth always wins
I yield back the balance of my time and join with our last witness in urging the committee to run for their lives.
I say to the world just because it is all of you against me, don't think I am wrong.
Now, my opponent may call himself a man of the world, but I have my doubts.
I guess I'm in the minority on this issue, but...
Now my opponent, whose ego is the size of the entire planet....
My opponent is a self-promoting blowhard concerned only with its own special interests.
You're not the boss of me.
I don't care how big you are, we're in charge now.
And I say to you that a prolonged fever does not prove the reality of Global Warming.
I told you it’s NOT HOT in here!!
well.. someone here thinks a lot of themselves..
My opponent is “warm”!  BOO HOO!
You may think you're getting warmer but my President is gonna make that part Great Again!
So let’s hear your side of the story Mr. Know It All...
The lone, skeptical scientist debates global warming.
"Studying the entire earth in one day can be...a little intimidating.
So we'll start this morning with the Western Hemisphere."
Size is relative.
Let me reiterate: "There is no such thing as global warming!!"
Storms, drought, flooding, famine. It's time for the voters to say 'goodbye cruel world."
As a businessman I can tell you these climate change restrictions would cause havoc.   What is your stake in all this?
We're debating pollution. You can't just cough.
That is where the Americas used to be before the President proclaimed climate change was FAKE NEWS!
It doesn't matter if the whole world is against me!  I could stand in the middle of Times Square and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.
My opponent is a Globalist, which means he is crazy. In addition, his version of the globe is not actual size.
What does a Mercator Globe know about accuracy?
I am sad to have to say this, but: From my observations throughout this debate, I truly believe that my opponent is polluted.
You seem to think we could continue to exist without economic growth!
Not flat?  Have you seen yourself in a mirror?
I'll Make America Great Again, while my opponent is wrongly focusing on the Americas.
He's at a loss, not Atlas!
And in conclusion, I have the world on my side.  Thank you.
Can you name the planet where you would find these land masses?
Goodbye
Hold on, I asked for a WORLD view!
Your platform lacks a global perspective.
You're really going to build a wall ?
My research still proves you are flat.
“I think you’ll find our next speaker is really on the ball ....   
           just out of this world.”
Don't you roll your sphere at me!
I made you what you are today.
I don't care that you showed up in person looking like this.
I *still* think you're flat!
Say hello to my little friend."
Hal always lost the debate on climate change to his opponent.
Look, I know what I agreed to, but I just assumed you were speaking in metaphor
It's a fake world!
And without further adieu, he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders
Our guest lecturer will be discussing the effects of globalization.
When are we going to start talking about MY needs?
Please sir, you've had your turn.
And take note of how my opponent is trying to flood this debate with irrelevant arguments
And it can be yours for the right bid!!
I yield the remainder of my eons to the honorable planet.
My opponent here promises the world; let me address you on a more human level.
I am honored to be speaking on behalf of the entire planet.
And, I’d like to introduce my co-presenter, who is quite worldly.
Ah, I can see right through this round-earther's ruse. You're an actor paid by NASA!
This is not what I meant by a continental presence.
My opponent's comments suggest he's from a different universe.
Voters today demand more than simple warmth!
And I repeat, I don’t see any evidence supporting my opponent’s claims of this so-called “climate change”!
And now, on this question of global warming, why don't we hear from Mother Earth, herself?
From where I stand nobody can tell me it isn't flat.
Your only campaign promise is to get Man to Mars?
You think your global perspective is so big.
That's not what your arctic face said last week on twitter!
Okay, okay. you have a climate problem.
Didn't we settle this debate 2,000 years ago?
My opponent has a more globalist point of view.
And now a word from our Sponsor
I don't care what the world says. I am right.
Excuse me, but your two minutes are up
It's YOUR problem. I don't respect planets who let its inhabitants change the climate
See? She's full of hot air!
So, what time is it over there?
Today is the first day of the end of your life.
OK God.  You win!
My opponent cannot hide his preference for big government.
Believe me, we hear you,
and we’re working on it!
My esteemed colleague considers himself an Atlas 
among mere mortals.
And, if my worthy opponent were really in tune with what's going on, she'd realize the public is tired of hearing about climate change.
Yes, I've heard all your "science," but you're full of hot air.
Fake news. If you were heating up, why would you be snowing up there?
But unlike my adversary, I am against a bigger global presence.
Consider my opponents history.  Can you really trust him?
Don't give me that half-baked, self-serving argument about the worldwide effect of climate change.
When considering the cosmos it's actually quite small.
And finally, here is my irrefutable proof that the Earth is, indeed, flat.
What 'world view'?  You don't even have eyes
I reject your global elitism!
I know a guy who says you're not really warm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, one at a time!
... it's not up for debate, the Earth is flat!
The World on stage
Now you’ve had your turn, it’s time to talk about REAL issues.
Re-Elect me, and I assure you, my opponent is a HUGE LOOSER!
And now, may I introduce the world, with few choice words to offer regarding global warming
Atlas your ride is here...
And what skeletons are hiding in my opponent's antipodes?
. . . And, speaking on the effects of global warming we have ...
'Environmentalism,' he says? That's just the sort of corrupt, self-serving rhetoric that we need to eliminate from our politics!
“Yours is the Axis of Evil!”
The Climate Change "Debate"
No worries. It's fake
Just WHO do you think you are?
Can I have some ice water?
The only conspiracy here is how you fit through the doorway
Although we are in this crazy heated debate, I definitely agree with you!  If it weren't for YOU, none of us would be here.
That's YOUR opinion!
Hmmfp......I will debate the Universe only!!
This next item for bids ....!
Yes, yes, we all know about you and your globalist philosophy!
And who do you think should pay for the wall?
Listen world, we did not cause climate change.
You can hear people from around the world telling me what a great job I’m doing!
Never have I heard such a self-absorbed World View...!
‘Stay cool, stay cool?’ What on earth...YOU stay cool!
Our next speaker is getting hot under the collar so it is his turn to be heard.
I'll be the one who decides whether your climate is changing or not!
With all due respect, my opponent is talking in circles to avoid the question.
My fellow Americans, I assure you that my worthy opponent doesn't have a leg to stand on!
My opponent is clearly a single-issue candidate.
Are views are world's apart.
My opponent is clearly unstable.
Such a nasty planet.
You see, you see, she is just blowing CO2 at you!
Until there’s bipartisan support we just  don’t have the votes, sorry.
Now you're just talking out of your Tropic of Capricorn.
Flat-earthers are not intimidated by your inflated ego!
I look forward to the day when we are no longer opposing each other.
You say that, but if anything, you look cooler to me.  Flatter, too.
Unlike my opponent, I am emphatically NOT a globalist.
Okay folks, let's give it up for our next speaker--Mother Earth!
The speaker to my left would like to talk about it's favorite topic, climate change?
This is our new navigation app everyone!
OK who is the wise ass who inflated my globe?
Who's we?
No, no, Mr. Asia, you are facing the wrong way.
I won’t make the opposing candidate’s lack of worldliness an issue in this campaign.
Please welcome World Peace!
My opponent has a heart of iron.
You can't handle the truth!
Globalization, Schmobilization
As President,  I promise I will move heaven and you to get it done!
Yes, I know this is billed as a World Conference....
You've had your say. Don't interrupt me when I'm on a roll.
I told him not to carry the whole world on his shoulders.
Blah blah blah....I happen to know that the other side disagrees completely.
Your presence here will not persuade us about climate change!
Unable to bear the burden of the world's problems, my opponent quit the race. I won't
When you know how to pay for carbon cuts, then we'll talk!
I'll ask you again for the final time- where were you when you last saw Atlantis?
You're a little too round for this flat earth debate sir
Let the voters choose: Flat earth or America first.
Let's hear it for my esteemed colleague who's taking a break from carrying the world on his back.
What's your opinion about living on Mars?
No need to scream. Your mic is on.
Please back up.Im feeling very warm.
As the final act of his two terms in office, Trump issued an executive order annexing this area to Russia.
Well, I'm not changing!
In this political climate, there is no earthly reason for your position!
On planet Earth maybe, but your so-called “facts” do not conform to alternative reality.
I feel as if the presidential polls are tilting in your favor
You will observe the earth appears to be a round flat disk, but we have reason to believe otherwise.
Bring it on!
Could you put your continent closer to the mic, I don't think the planets in the back can hear you.
You lier, we all know you’re flat!!!
People vs. Climate Change
Will you stop ignoring me. Now listen to your Mother Earth!
I never thought that they meant this debate would be attended by the whole world.
My esteemed colleague thinks it’s getting hot in here; probably just a case of greenhouse “gas”!
...and now we'll zoom in on Muskrat Ridge, Minnesota.
My opponent, the globalist.
And to think, I was expecting you to come out flat.
I predicted that widening the canal would allow South America to drift eastward, and I was right.
And if your promises were Earth-shattering, we wouldn’t be here!
My opponent this evening is a noted "Flat Earther"!
The man who has the whole world in his hands, seems to have disappeared.
Contrary to what you think, we do have at least one commonality. We’re both mostly made up of water. So there!
And as you can plainly see, the President's proposed new walls will keep out Mexicans! Chileans! Brazilians! Venezuelans! Cubans! Germans! Canadians! Alaskans! Hawaiians!
he said “flat earth” not “fat earth”
With all due respect, I believe that there is no consensus to support your claim that climate change is caused by human activity.
Hold on.  We’re turning up the AC
If I had a nickel for every time someone tried to convince me that they speak for planet earth, I’d be a rich man.
What do you know?
I’m leaving if California comes on inch closer.
Please, please please...Slow your roll.
I see no point to this global debate!
Yes, as his spokesperson, I can tell you, Donald Trump knows best how to fix you.
My opponent cannot be trusted on global climate change, as a globe, her view of climate change is clouded by her pro-globe bias
My opponent is making a circular argument
Just because you are round does not mean the earth isn't flat.
Don't be fooled by my opponent's earthy appearance. She's responsible for global warming!
And the earth responded, "I'm not flat, I'm big boned."
That’s, like, your opinion, world.”
In my concluding two minutes, I would like to just touch on North America
Oh yeah?  Well who appointed you guardian of the world?
Just let me make this one Archimedean point.
Yes, we KNOW you have problems . . . But WE didn’t make them . . .
Is this thing on?
What on earth are you arguing about?
In the old days we always said the whole world was in front of you, now ...
You’re not listening!!
Stop trying to bowl me over with your take on global warming!
It's hiding something. Where's its long-form birth certificate?
Mother Earth, what is your position on global warming?
Pay no attention to him. That's just how he rolls.
And now, in perfect harmony, the world will sing!
Even though you say you're hot, I still don't believe in global warming!
As everyone can see, my opponent is all wet!
Another continent heard from.
My opponent denies it, but given the current climate, change is our only option.
Your argument has fallen flat
Don't believe what my opponent says he can fix; he has a world of problems of his own.
No pressure, your only speaking on behalf of the whole world.
I give you WORLD PEACE!
I yield to my opponent.
Will the gentlewoman yield?
That’s only one hemisphere!
If my opponent claims to be getting warmer, let's take his temperature right now!
My friends, we finally have proof! The world is flat, there is no global warming in a  flat world, and the border walls are only from a Hollywood set."
Your comments betray your Western bias!
...and yes, you may say my views are out of the mainstream, but let me remind you that world opinion is only that: opinion!!!
It is my contention, that the world is flat.
Excuse me, could I get a glass of ice water before the debate begins? 
It’s getting a bit toasty in here.
Don't believe those who say the world is getting smaller!
And who, my friends, do you think is going to pay for these elitist policies that my opponent suggests?
You people can’t see what I can - it’s flat dammit
See...he just talks in big circles
Actually, this is more of a comment than a question.
OK. Don't get so puffed up about it.
These lands used to be called 'continents' before the water covered them.
Well, folks, our next presentation about global warming will be given by Mother Earth .
That’s not where Lake Huron goes.
And my friend, Gaia, here, thinks she's too big to fail!
What proofs do you have that we are destroying you?
Mother Earth, what are your comments on climate change?
Talk about special interests.
At least the rest of the solar system agrees with me.
I don’t care how hot you are. Nobody but me touches the thermostat.
...therefore, I conclude global warming is fake news.
Apropos of nothing, notice how the upper Northwest region of North America resembles a goblin.
It's rigged.
More Fake News!
Hot enough for ya?
Your world view sucks!
I don't care what the other 99% say, who are you to tell me it's man made?
My opponent is really turning up the heat.
We love climate change, don't we folks?  My opponent, she resists, but she's looking hotter every day!  Should we give her a round of applause? Let's clap for her folks...
And here we have the Americas
At this scale, you can actually see how much of Miami is already below sea level.
Just because you're 4.5 billion years old, doesn't mean you know any thing about climate change!
So I ask my opponent: why are you even here?
Too weighty an argument.
Ok, now my compatriot will give you the World View.
My opponent is so very naive in believing that each of us can really make a difference in this world “
I'm sick and tired of feeling like an outsider!
Mother Nature has something to say.
And now that I've completed the demonstration of my shrink-ray...wait where is everybody?
Okay, my opponent does have a clear perspective about global warming!
Our guest speaker tonight, standing before his latest creation, will address "The Challenges of Creation."
No, YOU'RE mistaken!
And once again my opponent seeks to sway your votes with a transparent blend of intimidation and self-interest!
My opponent purports to represent a world view; but I say it is a small world.
World, what ever you do--don't sneeze.
I'll take "Scorch" for $500 Alex
'"It has come to my attention some of you believe we are mired in a global crisis!"
My opponent chooses to hide behind global warming, but what evidence do you have?
Who are you going to believe, me or the world's biggest globe?
If I may play Devil’s Advocate, some might say that you have failed to take responsibility for your own welfare and are, therefore, responsible for your own plight.
And what is your opinion on climate change?
All my opponents contentions of  malaise are anecdotal, personal and very subjective.
Every time I try to debate this happens.
My opponent is trying to get you to warm up to him.
Such a nasty woman!
And, your Hot Flashes are distracting!
I'm just here for the air conditioning!
But the record shows that you are NOT interested in world peace!
Your ideas fall flat.
We could debate this all day long and all night long and all day long and all night long and...
Your points are flat!
Warming, he claims? Hardly!  I served at 98.6. I know 98.6. 98.6 is a vital sign of mine. My opponent is nowhere near 98.6.
Make the Earth Great Again? Socialism!
I will conclusively prove you don't have a leg to stand on. Could somebody turn on the air?
I'm not 'two-faced' you moron, I'm just rotating along my axial tilt!
Do I hear 230 trillion?
Unlike my opponent, Mr. Atlas, I will never let you down.
And I say it's fake news.
According to our consultants your evidence for global warning is inconclusive.
Pit me against the world, I’ll win!
You’re just slanted, tilted spin.
Shut up, your killing me.....
As the poet Wordsworth said so many years ago, "The world is too much with us."
These continents would not be empty if they had believed in climate change.
Quick, get me that lever!
When I refer to the earth as small,I am speaking in relative terms.
Oh no, Mother Earth! You too?
Just turn and roll away, why don't you - make my day!
Wait! I'm signed up to speak on global warming not global inflation!
Our next speaker is among the most recognized speaker on the world stage!
I feel at a disadvantage debating the global economy.
Today's debate: Climate Change--fact or fiction.
How can it have got too warm in here if I'm still wearing my tie?
Hold it right there! The science is still out on your round-Earth theory!
They say actions speak louder than words but apparently that's not the case. The Earth has something to say.
Please, stop spinning. This isn’t helping my macropsia
Ha! You've been shrugged off.
You're out of orbit on this one.
You make a valid point, sir, but in all fairness, you looked really flat!
.
  Our next speaker is Atlas, who is feeling a lot lighter these days since Trump alienated most of the weight of the world.
The American people reject one-worldism.
Fact! It is not getting warmer in here. Ask any scient-ish.
Shape-shifting doesn't make you a climate change expert.  You need charts and photos.
“It’s not global warming; they are only hot flashes."
Now please explain your comments about being “pro natural selection.”
The good news is the Panama Canal will eventually be obsolete.”
It’s your fault for having an environment to ruin!
How could you be warm?  The air conditioner is set at 72F.
Further more, my opponent's climate change policies are based on outrageous conspiracy theories.
Oh, please. It's just these hot stage lights...
Sure, you beat me in experience, Mother Earth, but I'm a man.
You keep saying that, but you don’t look any warmer to me?”
Stop the world, I wanna get off.
As I've told your president many times, the whole thing is America.
I still don't believe in global warming.
When on earth do I get to talk?
You don’t speak for me!
Climate, schlimate--my opponent can't even stand up straight!
...and, as absolute proof, this two-dimensional opponent proves my flat earth contention.
"And now, for the worldwide consensus..."
How am I supposed to argue against the world?
Hold on, we need to get you a bigger microphone.
Put your hand down, sonny! I've got something to say about what's really going on!
Make the Americas Matter Again
Your point is well taken, Atlas.
I don't care what you think. I'm American, therefore I come first.
In any discussion of geopolitical trends, it's essential to have an expansive world view.
Hey, hold up there, I think you're getting a little too hot...
That's really not your best angle!
It's just a big balloon filled with hot air!
Where in the world did you get that information?
As the WWW turns 30, I'd like to apologize on its behalf for Twitter.
You claim you're too hot, but I see snow and glaciers, right there, in Alaska!
And let us see your positive side
Not all at once!
This presentation will be short - the speaker hasn't got long to live
Don't you shrug your shoulders at me!
I'll keep this short since time is running out; "I'm dying".
Sorry, It's all about Me!
Me thinks the world is too much with us.
I think the world of my opponent, but he can be overbearing.
Cool it, hot head!
Now now, let's not get heated buddy.
This argument is getting way too heated.
An now for the definitive word on global warming,I'd like to introduce.....
I can only speak for myself!
We need to eliminate this global threat. - David Ostrov
Our first speaker is a world-class traveler.
Will you vote for your fellow man, or this filthy rock?
Stop right there! Like you are an expert in worldly things.
You have things all turned around!
As the end is near, now a quick word from the Western Hemisphere.
Oh contraire, we are rapidly changing course, for example, I’m now seeing paper straws everywhere.
My opponent is hiding behind Antarctica!
Atlas Smushed!
Unlike my opponent, I take global warming very seriously....
Not that it really matters, but that little dot just off the coast of Florida is Treasure Cay, Bahamas and that's where I'm taking my Family for a vacation in April
Rising oceans?  That's Fake News, Mother Earth!  Time you realized the only thing worth hearing about is rising profits!!
I say - You should go back where you came from!
If the world is in so much danger, then why doesn't it say so?
I'm sorry...but I am speaking about universal principles...
Our next speaker is Atlas. He should be lifting up shortly.
The whole world revolves on it
Brag all you want. We all know you are getting smaller.
Earth, are you trying to tell us something?
I would like to introduce our featured speaker who will  talk on the subject of earth’s climate change.
Stop right there!  I am the president and I have declared that we are NOT warming you up !
Now let’s hear from the Defense.
I will admit that my opponent has made effective use of social media.
Now class this is the Western Hemipshere
My opponent is obviously biased in favor of climate warming. I’d like to remind the audience that he has provided no direct evidence of ice-melt.
Despite all the evidence I maintain my opponents arguments still fall flat
Mankind is a virus and natural disasters are the cure!
So what are your thoughts on global warming?
My opponent's head must be in the clouds!
What in the world?
And speaking for the pro side of the Global Warming debate....
And you call yourself an oblate ellipsoid.
So, Parents, we are now on Day 3 out of  7 of your children's Science Experiment
. "The world would like to says a few truths about global warming "
Can we discuss world peace?
My opponents is a true globalist
After learning that a skilled debater must argue both sides, Earth proves itself flat.
Ok, ok, I’ll refer to you as “earth”, not “the planet”.
I believe climate change is another example of my opponent flip-flopping on issues.
Sir, although you may be a celestial orb, I submit that you lack standing!
Give me a place to speak and I will conquer the world.
I'm sorry, but the fire department will not allow anything this hot in the auditorium.
My opponent's so-called curvature would only serve to weaken our position on the international playing field.
You might contain multitudes, but I've got the NRA and the Koch Brothers I my corner!
My opponent as you can ladies and gentlemen is clearly an internationalist.
Ma'am, please keep it cool. This doesn't need to be a heated conversation.
My opponent will get nothing done if elected because he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders."
Lock Earth Up!
This worldly candidate is throwing his polar ice cap into the ring.
How big was yo mama?!
Globally,we want to hear what you think!
You think you're hot! I say you're not!
Stop asking ME questions. Let’s ask the WORLD.
. . . and after that rollicking critique,we thought we'd let her speak for herself.
Your opinion notwithstanding, all experts are not in agreement.
You just think you're hot stuff.
Fred 
 Fred! Come back! I told you not to get to close to the water
I still debate it's flat.
But it appears my opponent here still believes all that nonsense about Climate Change.
Our next speaker will tell us how it finally rid itself of parasites  through heat therapy.
My opponent wants to solve all the world's problems; but I have proven I can eat a deep-fried corn dog on a stick.
My opponent claims to have the weight of the world on his shoulders, but I assure you it's a hoax.
No, we don't celebrate Earth Day anymore.
Speak, world. What can we do to save you?
WE CAN SAVE OUR HALF IF WE FORGET  ABOUT THE OTHER HALF
Now that you're here, please settle the debate: Did Tony Soprano die in the finale?
My opponent is spreading fake news! Everyone knows that you are flat!
He's got the whole world in his hand.
Ah, with a wave of my hand and 20 more years of a fossil fuel based society I can make this all disappear!
Introducing global warning.
Whoa! One thing at a time.
All together now!  He's got the whole world in his hands, he's got the whole world in his hands......
It’s hard to win a debate when everyone else is against you.
And HE claims he wants to make the world a better place, but can you see that happening?!
I see some very cloudy thinking.
Regardless of how much evidence she's presented, I'll just never believe that climate change is real.
Let's skip the debate and make this my concession speech.
I reject the earth's statement on global warming!
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  This miracle occurred on Day Two, and absolutely nothing my opponent says will convince me otherwise.
Please leave the room - FAKE NEWS!
Now, I think our audience would really like to hear you dish about your relationship with Pangaea. What really broke you up?
Hi Mom, I finally made it to the world stage.
Why aren't you on climate strike!
Can somebody open a window? its kinda hot in here
You’re like my Ma. You complain about the heat and too cheap to turn on the A/C.  So you blame me, always me.
You and me against the world,"..
We'll just let it speak for itself.
My opponent needs to accept that our momentum is irreversible and her time is done.
Your personal problems are not our's
With all due respect, methinks the lady doth protest too much.
This debate is out of this world!
Counterargument from Unexpected Speaker at Davos
I told you time and again! Not yet, ya big bully.
So you think you have the weight of the world to worry about, let me explain something to you.
I'd like to introduce the Earth, who has had enough bull caca about climate not being a very serious thing.
It was then that he remembered both his fear of public speaking AND his xenophobia.
My opponent seems to thing getting all hot and bothered is going to sway the voters!  Not on my watch!
Nothing to worry about.  It's really flat.
Some people would say I’m the biggest. They would say I’m bigger and better than the entire world.
Will our next mystery guest enter and sign in, please
This is your last global warning, only one person can speak at a time.
Don't be so roundabout
Yes we know it’s our fault you’er warming up but you didn’t need to crush Antarctica just to prove your point !
Hold on there, Buddy, you think you're the whole world?
My constituents say otherwise!
This is what it will look like with no Starbuck’s
I represent something bigger than you!
Not all at once, please.
I agree that the major problem of our time is global shrinking.
It’s not your turn yet, Mr.Global Warming, we need to discuss some wall issue first!
I always knew you were round...
And what proof do you have that climate change is real?
We're abandoning all of this, in favor of an intelligent planet.
Let's reflect on my opponent's claim to the consensus view...
And now the planet has a few things to say on the subject of mercy.
What are your thoughts on climate change?
I know you're out there somewhere, you bum.
Wait, you can't just roll all over Bernie
So moved.
Stop complaining!
Global opinion seems to be against my opponent.
We've already seen Pangea, you don't need to do the trick again
Changing! not warming.  And, nobody likes a smartass, sir.
I'll give you the last word.
Her ego is out of control.
You? Round? A Socialist Hoax!
It will take 12 hrs for us to hear the voice of the other side of the world. We can't wait that long.
And let's not forget all those offshore deposits.
While I am poised and composed, note my opponent’s nervousness exhibited by sweating and spinning!
My opponent is obviously overly- awed by my power point
Let's stop before this gets too heated.
Now, I'm sure I'm going to be called a bigot for calling you a "globalist"
W O A H , stop  STOP ! .. Madame Speaker , are you OK ?
Your argument goes round in circles. Like your shape!
See, it's really not a small world after all.
I am uncategorically opposed to globalism!
God has asked the earth to speak in her stead.
Why should Florida be the center of the world?
Just look at my opponent's miserable record.  Nothing is certain except death and taxes.
The point is, it's just you and me against the world!
I believe the opposition has a distinct advantage.
THERE IS  NO  SUCH  THING  AS  GLOBAL WARMING!
Furthermore, we are much more important than you - we can think.
I can tell that you are hot and bothered with me!
Has the globe warmed up enough to respond?
No, that’s not Israel
It was a well-rounded argument, but the rebuttal was out of this world.
How can you sit there and deny global shrinking?
I present to you the United United States of America!
I will not be intimidated by my opponent's outmoded reliance on 
size.
And now, supporting this evening's resolution, "Climate Change is Real", a last minute added  speaker . . .
Let me just stop you right there, Earth.
OK, Global Warming! You don't have to be so inflated about it!
You may not be flat, but certainly flat wrong.
...In conclusion, while my opponent flatly denies it, all her arguments are nothing but hot air.
We all heard what the World is saying but let me put it this way?
Nevertheless, she persists!

Margaret Olnek, Superior, Colorado
You try convincing the world!
And I am going to call it "Trump World".
My opponent continues to shrug his responsibilities.
Don’t you dare use that condescending tone with me!
My speaking prop is brought to you by Costco
My opponent continues to attack my record protecting endangered sea turtles. To that I have one response: Dinosaurs.
I am not getting hot under the collar.
And on your right, discussing global warming, is The World!
Need I state the obvious?  3/4 of the World’s population has a different view.
If you can’t take the climate change get out of the kitchen
Make America not so great this time!
As you can see, I'm more concerned about Global Shrinking !
We're citizens of the United States, not the world.
Thank you for that uplifting speech, Atlas!
Remember, this is not a debate it’s an intervention.
You all know her as the late, the great, the soon-to-be-retired ...
Here to present the American perspective is.....America
I STILL say you're wrong!
I stand by my flat Earth comments. You call those Grand Tetons?
I matter as much as you!
When they said Mother Earth was going to speak today I definitely didn’t expect this.
As anyone can plainly see the truth rolls right off of you.
South America couldn't move to Canada so it is moving to Africa.
The earth, like a coin, has two sides.
I'll get to global warming in a minute.
I still say the earth is flat
The skeletons in my opponent's record, you just wouldn't believe!
I wish to welcome you to the first Democratic Presidential debate.  Uncertain that our venue would accommodate the current
candidates plus those undecided, we have opted for an alternative  format...
Ladies and gentlemen - your oyster
Have you spun off your axis completely with that crazy global warming theory?
Don't be fooled.  My opponent will tell you fake stories about global warming.
It's just a fever, not the apocalypse.
I know you think you’re the world’s greatest debater, but I disagree.
I'm more important than you are. And I have the rigorous poll data to prove it!
Let's talk climate change
Planet Earth, we welcome you to Jupiter
As usual earth refuses to go on the record"
The fact is, let's say it, is Mr Atlas is too old
































Hold him up! Hold him up!
The big picture from here, you can't see change.
No Collusion!
I knew you would drag climate change victimhood into the debate!
Welcome to the Flat Earth Society. I am sorry to say that our next speaker was sucked up by an unknown gravitational force.
You have been nothing but a drama queen.
I will never believe that you are round nor warming.
And I suppose that is meant to be your version of the Great Lakes?
I must have ten billion dollars to build MY spherical wall.
Hold on, you'll get your chance to talk.
It all started out as nothing
Donald,Donald put it down!
So who says my opinion isn’t as good as your 7.6 billion?
Fake, fake, fake news!
Look, don't get me wrong, you've done good by us so far; we just need to give those business and agriculture lobbyists the voice they deserve.
It looks like we’re in a world of trouble.
I've already told you...GLOBAL WARMING IS FAKE NEWS
Your voice may be big, but your audience is small.
What in the World do you mean by that!?
you had your time to speak!
What's that, Mother, you say all the other countries are behind you?
What in the world makes you an expert on if global warming exists or not?
I agree with my opponent's world view
You’re no Jack Kennedy
My opponent has flip-flopped on the environment.
You just stop right there!
We refuse to be intimidated by your climate extortion rhetoric!
Ok, ok, I'm attracted to you - everyone is. But what's that go to do with this argument?
and now, lets hear the silent majority!
Wait a minute! I have to talk about why there is no such thing as climate change.
This is the new plan with no borders to worry about.
And now let's hear the other side of this heating debate.
Our next guest didn't believe in "extra terrestrial life" until we came along.
I'm four times the size of Baja California, so don't give me your crap that i'm just a small human."
...and that is why you are wrong about global warming!
Just because you’re bigger than me doesn’t mean you’re right.
Those polar ice caps were not worth anything
 anyway
To answer your question, no, I never smoked pot in college
One at a time please.
And our next speaker speaks to us from down-under
Here's to our next world-class candidate for 2020.
My opponent may think global, but I'm not buying the local act.
The gravity of it’s performance is captivatingd
First to the rostrum will be South Pacific. Then we'll hear from the other side at the anti-podium.
And now let's hear from Mr. Atlas...Mr. Atlas is speaking for the motion
Using this life-sized model of the earth,I shall now explain to you why climate change is no big deal.
What in the World are you saying? 
Everyone knows you're round, not flat"
Even if I am the only one, I will speak my truth!
My opponent would hope to distract you with her earthy comments.
My opponent’s carbon-tax proposal is ludicrous.
While I completely agree that climate change is an urgent matter, we first need to decide which automotive industries will receive the biggest tax breaks.
As the previous speaker was saying, it's clear that global roaming is the greatest existential threat we face today.
Let's not be irrational—OK, sweetheart? You're just having a hot flash.
As anyone can see, my opponent cannot speak for the other 5 billion people on earth.
Welcome, just to set the record straight,round or flat??
Still flat?
The condition of our planet is debatable?
I yield the balance of my lifetime to the gentleman from Pangea.
now whats your opinion on global warming
‘Someone tell me how this is possible.’
My opponent has no earthly idea!
The debate is over.
Time to chill!
It seems that  that Atlas shrugged our debate
Don't think you can just roll over me here...!
It appears Professor Higgins will be receiving his award posthumously.
You stand there and tell how climate change has affected you!
Flat-Earther Debate
You don't have to be silent - It's not Spring.
and here on my left is the manifestation of donalds trumps ego.
Don't let this hologram fool you, the Earth is flat!
Clearly, my opponent has no grasp of detail.
The climate change debate just got serious.
So, what’s the big deal?  We all know the Earth has climate...
Furthermore, my worldview is superior to that of my opponent.
I'll let you speak in a moment. Though you probably won't have a point.
Please, one at a time.
I staunchly defend pineapple on pizza.
And now we hear from our heavyweight speaker on the topic of global warming
And for our Global Warming segment, let me introduce our next speaker, North America.
okay, okay your getting a little heated tom.
Stop acting like my mother!
That’s how I roll.
Please tell us what proof you have of climate change!
So you don't care about global warming? Well, how does global rolling grab you?
This World Debate is NOT fair and balanced!!!
And now we will hear from the representative from Fiji.
Got the message but you're going to have to simplify.
You don't look so warm to me!
If you don't believe it's flat, I'm going to turn this  over and you will see for yourself!
Coming soon to a theatre near you: "Honey, I Shrunk the Climate Change Deniers!"
And if it's global warming, why is it so cold in here?"
It's a small world yet there is an ocean between me and my opponent.
We can’t shrug this off!
Your hot flashes are not germane to this campaign.
Liar!  That's not what I mean by "Make America Great Again"
And now our keynote speaker, Mother Earth, will share with us her perspective on global warming.
My worthy opponent has decided that we need to play, 'Where is Waldo?'
Give me one proof that you're not flat.
The flat Earth debate continues...
I don’t care about your so-called evidence.  I’m a very smart person, and I say global warning is a Chinese scam
He's just a bunch of hot air
Global warning.
Just shrug it off.
Now I know how Indiana Jones felt!
To the best of my knowledge, this globe is actual size.
Yes, I love my country. I’m a proud nationalist. Unlike my opponent, Lil’ Globey! Isn’t that right, Globey?
Wait, before you start, don't say anything that will get us heated up.
So you agree that humans should not be vaccinated.
Hold on there big fellah. I paid for this microphone.
Can't you think about anyone else except yourself?
Earth, you're looking extra hot today
If I could finish…
The next speaker will address the possibility of life on the other side.
Hemispheres of the world, unite!
You're full of hot air!
Before we begin, could you state your name and why you're running for president?
Next debater: global warming; fact or fake news?
Klaatu Burada Nikto
Hang on, up there! Mr. Atlas is still in traffic.
Yes, well, we’ve heard all about your perspective, but what about the blinkered, local view?
Does this outfit make me look fat?
Hell hath no Fury like Climate Change scorned!
All your comments are one-sided!
Yes, that was pitch perfect but it's not that kind of flat we're debating.
And now, Atlas!
You're missing the point!"
Can I get my oponent’s mic raised a little? I feel like I’m talking to the Earth’s vagina.
I don't want to be the lone desenter, but...
As can be seen here, the Affirmative side of the Flat Earth debate is struggling in his rebuttal.
My opponents self-serving proposals are not sustainable.
Do not argue with a Homo sapien!
I’m surprised you got through the door Larry, looks like you packed on a few extra...pounds.
I think you have a pimple on your backside. Oh wait, that's just New Zealand. Never mind.
All right then, I'll concede the Americas...
I know I speak for everyone here when I say we're all very tired of your speaking so elliptically.
I firmly disagree with my worldly opponent.
Stop! You don't have standing! We've already heard what you have to say, and no one believes you
Your stale arguments are hardly you-shattering.
And my opponent would have you believe the world is round.  Just more FAKE NEWS.
My base believes me not you!
Polls are meaningless!
Actually, you're flat.
You might think this is a big soap bubble, and it is.
If you’re warming at such an alarming rate how do you explain your presence on this stage?
You feel cool from here!!
That was before the Suez Canal
Don’t let my opponent’s flat earth denial fool you.
Earth as seen by the Republican National Committee!
Populism will always trump globalism!
You just think you're putting your best face forward.
Sorry folks Jimmy got a little carried away with the paper mache model.
Atlas, up from out of in under there!
My opponent has an inflated view of himself if he pretends he's a globalist at heart!
The Earth would like to end the climate crisis conference with a closing statement. Can I get a Mike?
And don’t get me started on the problems happening in your district.
Yes, I know my opponent is worldly.
You, madam have been around too long to appreciate modern ideas.
And now for the cosmology report.
What you’ve always been lacking is proper representation
Let me finish Mother Earth!
Despite his spotty voting record, my opponent would like you to believe he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Well, I think you suck too!
My opponent has lost focus on our district's concerns.
How would you know about global warming anyway?
You don't scare me - there is no such thing as global warming.
You have no standing in this court!
I know a side effect of global warning is hot air but please wait your turn
STOP!!!We have addressed global warming.
I challenge my opponent to release their measurements to the public so we all may know whether they are flat or round.
I can't handle the truth! My existence is grotesque and incomprehensible.
Your argument about being a big shot doesn't hold water -- look around you -- there 's the Pacific and Atlantic oceans!
And I say... you're not global enough!
Sorry, but there's not point in debating the issue of global warming. The President has spoken.
I was told this was going to be a Town Hall meeting.
Whoa - slow your roll.
How about you let me answer this one?
Alas, let’s let the globe have a word about it’s own issues.
It seems that my opponent, Atlas, is too scared to show up to this debate.
The world is too much with us!
As moderator I would help if you could keep your comments to 25 words or less. You have a lot of people with you
Quit the dramatics and stop whining!
OK, we get it!
NO! I'm tired of debating climate change with you!
Stop right there! I get the message.
I flatly disagree with how you've rounded your climate figures.
Please, let me finish.
I feel the earth moving over my feet.
Quit repeating that fake news.  No, it's not hot in here.
Can someone move this thing... it's getting warm in here.
And in conclusion, let me just say, "you don't look warm to me".
Globalisation is round the corner.
Recent Connection between North and South America Reaffirmed
wait if youre here,,,, then I'm... oh no! not again!
I will not be bullied, Mother Earth!
Please state your opinions on how we’re doing.
“My opponent here is a one-worlder!”
Ms.Earth,do you believe in Climate Change.
By way of introduction, I'd say that our next speaker has truly seen it all.  And, oh the secrets she can tell!
There you go again, with your American-centric arguments!
My ex-wife is near the upper right, sort of
I know you have big problems but so do I!
What evidence do you have to keep denying the Arctic is going bald?
Is that your only talking point, Global Warming?
Find Newfoundland!  Free Newfoundland!
Well... it’s obvious this is just a round earth shill
I may be in the minority here, but...
Yo Earth, I’m really happy for you, I’ll let you finish, but Mars has some of the best videos of all time!
Back up, you are burning me up!
You're only appealing to your base!
You may have won this debate, but I'm patient enough to know that I will be the winner in just 12 years.
Now now, don't blow your cool!
And now, without further ado, you all know her.....(thunderous applause drowning out name)
My worthy opponent has disappeared into the South Pacific.
You need a route canal.
my opponent, or "Fat Orb" as some have called her...
Ms. Earth is not fit to hold office.
Don't preach to me about CO2 emissions, not 
when you flew here on on your own private jet!
World Climate Conference

"Can you scooch? You're blocking my PowerPoint."
My opponent is looking a little feverish.
Stop!  In the name of love!
World, you now have thirty seconds to counter the President's statement.
My opponent thinks climate change isn't a hoax...but I know better!
Why so negative? It's like night and day when you let your darker side out.
Don't listen to her - she's full of hot air!
Stop lying to the populace! You're the exact same temperature you've always been.
Isn't it obvious, the Earth is flat.
I would remind you, good sir, that my name is Archimedes.
And as host of “The Blue Planet” you claim climate change to be fact?
It was six days, God rested on the seventh.
Since the other speaker didn't show, let's have a contest. Now, everyone write one cartoon caption about this massive ball on stage and I'll collect them, read them aloud,  and we'll somehow declare a winner. Tie breaker: Where is Columbus, IN?
Let's here from everyone, but please keep it under 24 hours.
The earth is flat. Don’t get so overheated.
How dare you, sir? My mother was a planet!
My young Democratic opponent professes to be a geography professor,really?
Our next speaker is the renowned world ...
Usually somebody warms up the crowd for me, not the other way around
My opponent here is full of hot air.
While my esteemed colleague will attempt to convince you otherwise, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the earth is flat.
Today’s Keynote: Expanding Your Horizons
My opponent is reportedly in hiding somewhere up there in the Hudson Bay area.
You want to talk about conflicts of interest?  Let’s talk about your Green New Deal, shall we?
You're nothing but a Chinese hoax!
Feels pretty cool to me.
Let's give a very warm welcome to our own Blue Marble.
Now, right there is the area we’ll be discussing today.
The whole world’s against me!”
- Griff Urang-Schuberth
Portland O
Current astromological views are truly wide-ranging,  however today I share Dr. H. Penny's well-known Buddhistic belief about the sky's impermanence.
Looks like my opponent has shrugged his duties.
Now stop rotating and listen! I find it hard to believe that you still do NOT believe in global warming.
‘During the debate he coukdnt’t get a world in edgewise’
What evidence do you have there's global warming ?
Our rebuttal to your argument is to look at the evidence.
As you can see, the organisers could not find a single person to stand against me
You say that now but as soon as you turn your back I’m sure we’ll hear another story!
And now, speaking on behalf of the Earth ...
I challenge you to a debate on climate change.
This is america.
That's all folks!
The world sure loves to argue.
We are in the midst of a global warning!
I beg to differ with that perspective!
Don’t touch! - it’s still hot from global warming
Now, Grandma Earth will talk about “human harassment”.
Fuck you
Atlas, speak into the microphone.
Poppycock. It's nothing but a heated discussion.
Not fair! I too would like a warm-up.
...but voters chose me!
All your answers are flat.
Folks, don't be fooled! This is just a tired rehashing of the EarthFirst! movement, and it didn't work the first time!
As you can see, the problems is at the NORTHERN border
And now, before she becomes extinct, we'll hear from our all plastic Mother Earth
We are the world, we are the children ...
Speak up, I can't hear you.
Better watch your back!
Is there something wrong with the Mic? You sound like you're under water.
My opponent has morphed into a globalist.
You are only a  part of what I'll own if  i'm elected!
I don't give a shit if you're on a roll!
I presume you are aware the president’s Science Advisor states the research is not clear on whether global warming actually exists . . .
... we're going to Canada and the USA, Mexico and Honduras... and Haiti and Aruba! We're going to Panama and Colombia and Brazil! And we're going to Argentina and Chile and Peru and Bolivia! and We're going to New York to take back the UN! YEAAAAH!
My opponent makes up in size what it lacks in brains.
Ahem
Is it my turn to speak yet?
My opponent would have you believe that what you see is what you get. I think not.
Hold on, hold on! What about my needs?
But  then WE created plastic.
So what else you got?!
If this is just about the tweeting,I can stop.
Well actually Mother Nature, the climate doesn't really work like that"
And now a word from the Earth about Globalization, as it relates to global warming, and our feckless leaders who are waiting for the whole Shithouse to burn down."
let me finish!
That's a preposterous opening statement but what should we expect from a flat-earther?
You're ALL against me!
Whoa! This five minutes per person rule isn’t working.
Archimedes? We will give you another fulcrum.
And now...proof that the world is flat.
To introduce our next speaker, Atlas... oh, darn!
Once again, I challenge my opponent to disavow that he aspires to higher office.
Well, I was banking on winning by default, so I didn't prepare any remarks. I am thoroughly stunned that my opponent made it through the door.
I think your take on a global economy is slightly exaggerated
My opponent WACKY Western Hemisphere and his friends in the FAKE NEWS media have ruined our country. SAD!
'Colleagues, I want to talk to you today about the New World Order.'
Your thoughts on Flat Earth theory.
Hey, hey - no need to get so hot-headed. I was just saying that climate change isn't our top priority right now.
Wait, I’m getting off  now.
As far as planets go, you've got the experience.  But can you wiggle your fingers?
'It's a compelling argument but I still you're flat!'
Don't be so upset. You know that I think the world of you"
Climate change is fake news!
My opponent, the incumbent, has stated that he feels the weight of the world in his shoulders. I say it is time for a change.
Now you're flat!
We are the one hundred percent.
It is my pleasure to introduce the Earth to speak on the issue of man made climate change.
Atlas, the world takes a stand!
So you're saying you are not flat you are at least 36d?
These days, it seems like the whole world has to have their say.
Is this thing “On”?
I can’t hear you !
And everyone on this side of the globe is technically "American."
No, we will not listen to your conplaints!
You're getting warmer? Not getting warmer! Fake news!
Another year's wear on your ozone layer and you're toast!
And where is "the planet" Pluto, today?
Uhh...How do you raise the microphone again?
He's old, but he still as wits about him.
Tomorrow, The World !
I’m telling you, climate change is not real!
This proves there is no such thing as global warming.
Get me the whoever is responsible for this. It's a small world.   I said it is a SMALL world.
Don't forget without me you are nothing.
Please, let me speak. You’ve held sway for far too long.
You haven't been new since 1492!
The earth is flat.  Don't believe my opponents crazy idea otherwise.
oh shit i live there
First, a shout-out to the Greelcruffs of Kalaxon 5 for hosting this event...
As you can see, the world is HUGE, the biggest you will ever see. And , as you can also see, absolutely flat.
Furthermore, regardless of your symptoms, I still say global warming is all in your imagination.
Simply put the world is a teenager, she's moody and climate change is temporary
I'm going to build a wall along your Mexican border!
If you don't disgorge the hydrocarbons at cost, my species will peel you like a grape.
Really?
No, I did not say that your hot flashes were caused by global warming.
OK. So much for YOUR  position on the issues.  What about the EASTERN hemisphere?
Most voters may think the world of you, but in this country....
It’s not global warming, you just have a fever.
A victim of global warming
As a small boy growing up in Liechenstein..........
And now, let me welcome to our stage all of America
You seem to be hiding the rest of the world behind your back!
Global warming, as you can see, is not caused by humans. It is that pregnant duck at the top of screen that is sucking up all of our air.
Now, tell them about the hurt you felt when you learned you were oval and not a circle.
This is the End of the World as we know it!
Uh, oh... looks like spaceship earth just squashed our next speaker.
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BIGGER..!!!!!!!
And let's see what's behind curtain number 2!
„See? If there was a problem she would speak now!“
Folks, please welcome Gaia here - she is in town just to soak up a little atmosphere...
I can now say with absolute certainty: Earth is as flat as a pancake!
Its the western version of the Euro, Trumps face is on the back.
She’s turning her stance yet again!
I’m for open borders—but all you say is “Build the Canal.”
Mr. Atlas, will you please step out?
Oh, sorry! I’m mean climate change not global warming.
I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine,... you’re no Jack Kennedy.
Global warming is REAL!! I feel it in my core!
She doesn’t even go here!
As you can see, my opponent doesn't stand a chance!
If elected, I promise to save the planet by shrinking it.
Another rude inter-eruption.
I can see your ice cap, need I say more?
It's not only warming, it's deflating!
Your argument is flat, and your logic is confined in a circle.
This isn’t fair! I can’t debate CLIMATE SCIENCE with Mother Earth !!
Despite appearances, I am quite certain the earth is flat!
People of Earth, you are making it really warm in here.
While my opponent supports unrealistic policies like the Green New Deal.
My opponent's arguments are giving a whole new meaning to the flat earth theory!
I"m here to tell you about climate change first hand.
Our guest speaker tonight, on the topic of Climate Change, is Gaia.
Hold it right there, tubby.
My opponent uses a lot of big words, but what does he have to back them up?
You don't scare me
This is where we were coming from before landing on Mar...
I'm letting you know at the onset that I won't be bullied during this debate.
Now just minute, I think your anti-flat earth bias is showing!
And now a word from the shrinking earth society.
Wait! Don't take my spotlight
Xenophobic nightmare comes true.
I’m here in spite of the revolution.
Stop World, I wanna get off!
And now for the opposing viewpoint...
We like to think of it as an open floor plan.
My opponent is blind to the beauties of the free market and capitalism, and is, indeed....A SOCIALIST!
Due to space limitations I will gain be representing Jupiter.
I would like to point out that this candidate has ignored New zealand!
Although mah opponent's accomplishments are indisputable, his arrogance is without precedent.
I sense you are drifting away from this debate.
"The opposition has been overcome by the weight of the world."
ok, Gaia, speak into the mike
So do you want to vote for me or Global Domination?"
For a little help in finally solving the mystery, please join me in welcoming Easter Island to the stage.
But what have you done for us lately?!
When in debate, I simply prefer to roll over.
I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.
And now, we will listen to my opponent's view from the world-at-large.
Although we can certainly appreciate your fire and fury, we simply aren’t willing to negotiate a peace agreement at this time.
On second thought, if we build a Second Tiny wall just South of the Banana Republics, Americans could once again enjoy their restful evenings. We would in essence be left with only one Sh_t hole country at our Southern boarder instead of eight."
Be specific.
I agree...the Dolphins should take over the world.
To my left is the... competition.
So-you're feeling warmer. Could it be menopause?
the old Al Gore in my space act will not do, Sir!
I don't care what you say, global warming does't exist!
Imma let you finish.
"So you're committed to saving the world, are you? And just why should we believe that you're any different from the rest?"
This... all of the world, is a LIAR!
The SCIENTISTS??  And now even YOU say you're too hot.  Why don't you just turn down the air conditioning?
When you're hot, you're not!
To achieve world peace we must not tolerate the image of North America spitting on South America
I'm not flat!
“I will not debate this any further! Obviously the Earth is flat!” 
-Dr. Flat Earther 

“Mother Earth, your rebuttle?”
-Debate Coordinator

“Now I know you didn’t just call your Momma Flat!”
Mr. Earth wait your turn
I say to all of you in the audience. Will you elect a flat candidate who continues to use this stage in order to circumvent the major issues?
Speaking for myself...
Fellow members, that is why we have adopted the song, "You and Me Against the World" as our theme
But the emails...
Why can't we just all get along?
Whoa, let's not let your problems get too big.
You may be worldly wise, but ...
My response to that is
if Earth doesn't Love it here 
then he can Leave
Just give it up. We all know you’re flat.
Look people. I know that check-in was a nightmare. Please be patient.
He found the other candidate's world view to be a bit polemic
Go ahead, the deniers dare you to make your case.
And this balloon represents his inflated view of America....
I tried to friend you on Facebook.
I would like to ask  my  opponent  in this  debate  'Why  she  did not  speak  up  before !"
Sure,North America is a major world power. But weren't you made in China ?
Sir, you speak roundly!
I must say my opponent looks unusually discomforting today.
How about another billion so we can keep using fossil fuels?
Now let’s see if those heads on Easter Island can talk.
Your mamma's so flat....
No, no, I said, “Africa.”
I stand by my statement that Mercacator is, and always will be, the gold standard of projections!
Admit it -- you have nationalist tendencies!
Based on the facts before us, my opponent cannot disprove my assertion that black is land and white is water.
Everybody knows you're flat. Fake News!
And my opponent, who is pro global warming, is just a hot head.
And I submit that the real crisis is that you're full of sh*thole countries!
I've seen global warming, and you sir- are no global warming.
My opponent is making heated arguments using constantly changing half truths.
Right but if I go, you’re coming with me.
I grant you,your rhetoric is earthy,but frankly,it's hard not to conclude you're all wet when it comes to the facts of the matter.
So, let me introduce to you the most worldly individual I have ever met!
Oh! Great Mother tell us if we are exceptional?
How do you go to the bathroom?
Atlas shrugged, then stumbled.
How unfair of you to call me anti-globalist!
Stop generalizing!
Will the distinguished planet yield to a spec?
And I say global warming is a hoax!
And so, in conclusion, I challenge you, the world, to commit to be a cleaner and more empathetic place.
Earth to the rebuttal!
No need to say it; I can already feel you warming.
What in the World  is This!
And now speaking about global warming, The World!
I was told this will be the most watched debate ever.
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, my opponent is full of nothing but hot air.
Science has not yet provided sufficient evidence!
As you can see, there’s a world of difference between our opinions here.”



Sasha Smith, New York Cit
Okay, I admit it - global warming is real and we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions!
I can assure you that pollution will subside in 15 years. By then we will be dumping our garbage on Mars.
OMG! The globe is only two-dimensional.
What I have here today is a revolution in the world of earth science!
Please, there's no need for ad hominem attacks.
I am ashamed because I know what my opponent is. He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat.
This really is a global movement.
Now, this may be an unpopular opinion...
Our speaker is the world famous bubble gum champ.
You may be a world renowned expert, but I think I know my constituents!
Trump Tower” here, “Trump Tower” there, “Trump Tower” everywhere
How can we trust my opponent after Krakatoa?
I have no earthly idea where he is.
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times: Covfefe!
Ther are two sides on this issue!
Everything gets so blown out of proportion these days.
Wee man, Americans, all of us, refuse to bow down to dictators!
My  opponent is blue with envy. Even if some think he is deep he is changing and can not be trusted.
Hold on you mean there’s no one left to represent your planet?
All together now:
I mean,aren't people only supposed to be 70% water?
Stop orbiting around and firm up your position already!
Unfortunately, Mr. Trump is unable to join us for this evening's Meteorological Society " Climate Futures" debate ...so let's move straight on to the weather forecast now and have a look at the chart for the next couple of days...
Hold you comments.
See for yourself; there’s no evidence of global warming whatsoever.
My opponent claims his climate is changing, yet he says nothing to defend himself here ... on the world stage.
I don’t care what you say. Global warming is a myth!!
And I’m against globe-alization too!
I’m King of the world!!
...and in the upper left the former 48 States, as they appeared pre-climate change.
Yes, I know the routine; ' HE has, you & me sister, in HIS hands ...Blah, blah,  the WHOLE world in HIS hands....' So, pray tell, how is HE able to 'wash his hands?
But all she offers is a noun , a verb and "Climate Change"
Oh, but before they claimed that the science around climate change spoke for itself.
Some things will go on, with us or without us.
To answer your question, no, not conjoined twins.
Despite repeated denials it's obvious my opponent is flat.
I've set up this debate to discuss the merits of scaleability
It's time to meet our first panelist on "Planetary Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me!"
now will you please stop interrupting!
please let me speak, for I am your home.
Moderator . . . moderator:  He is allowed to inflate himself like that?  Was that in the rules?  I didn't see that in the rules!
Weather as we knew it has left the building........
Remember planets are for people!
What America needs right now is an outsider.
Who can point out to us where we are today?
Atlas, I finally get to debate my opponent
Shape up or we'll move out.
Can we really take the word of someone on NASA's payroll?
You know, you can be kind of a bully!
Planet Podium gets heated.
You seem a bit heated, take a chill pill.
You expect people to believe that Natural Order is an argument.
Now time to welcome Christopher Columbus to the stage, and let him tell us what he thought would happen next.
No, YOU'RE the puppet.
And as final proof that what I'm saying is inarguable, please note that my opponent stands mute!
and now- to speak its own case - May I introduce Earth
I have it in good authority that my opponent feels indebted to China.
If  I am elected, I will represent more than just the Americas!
As you can see, Gandalph has turned himself into an giant inflatable globe. I am sure what point he is making, but I think any prick would be able to pop a hole in his argument.
When I said you were his oyster, I didn't mean it literally.
Give us 22 minutes and we'll give you the world.
The potentially deleterious consequences of climate change will never be a concept that any right-thinking person will ever warm-up to and embrace.
Harvard, harder to get to than the North Pole.
Mr. Earth, I'm not sure you're seeing things correctly, but clearly you are flatter than the postcard I sent to my friend across your Atlantic Ocean.
Stop following me around the stage.
But I like my pickup truck, Mr. Earth
Guys, I think Earth wants no-deal Universexit...
Ladies and gentlemen, speaking sui generis tonight....!
You can feel the heat
I will destroy you mother!
If you look closely, the other speaker is now swimming near the Panama Canal.
And Mexico, no South America will pay for the wall !
I’m afraid you’re not as big as you used to be.
Like I said before, you are as flat as your affect!
City Arts and Lectures is proud to welcome the Pacific Gyre.
And, now, a word from the world. World take it away.
I think all of you can see that I am perfectly comfortable standing here; that there is not a single degree of excessive heat coming off of my opponent...clearly she's lying!!
as you already know …
my opponent refutes my explanation
as to who is responsible for global warming
You claim to be well rounded, but as everyone can see, you just fall flat.
May I submit to you that I do have a very worldly view of things
I really hate these debate competitions where I’m supposed to defend the use of fossil fuels.
Mother does NOT always know best!
Global Warming Show & Tell
Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent is a flat-earther in globalist clothing.
Stop trying to pull me off my tangent
Go West People, Go West!
My opponent calls it Climate Change. I call it a flip-flop.
Um, actually, Global Warming is fake news; you have no evidence to prove it otherwise.
My opponent has water on the brain.
You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world.
I'm entitled to my opinion!
I refuse to yield my time to my blue and green colleague.
At the Global Convention, there was no getting around the fact that the Earth is indeed round.
As you can clearly see in this debate, denial of global warming just got the better of my esteemed colleague.
This proves that his beach ball is bigger than any other president's!
Before we blame this all on climate change, let's just see where you are in your cycle.
Do you think you can unilaterally decide on the future of the Earth?
Gaia Rights Debate
...and on this side, we have the perfect example of  'the Haves versus the Have-nots.'"
The flat earth society won't debate me
First my opponent went on about the global economy. Then he ranted about global warming. I say "America First!"
In a sinister move, Presidential Hopeful raises Carbon levels in order to melt his opponent during a nationally televised debate.”
We made Americas great again, tomorrow the world.
Your natural resources?
Man needs to take into account, Mother nature has an opinion too.
My opponent in this climate change debate can't even speak up for itself. Why on earth should we believe it?
It was Stew against the World.
The World can speak for herself!
And another thing...
I've got the world on a podium.
Now it's your turn, Mother Nature.
See there the earth is round.
I've upped my carbon usage, World.  Up yours!
You are a cheap recreation of my Mother!
The dream of a post-border continent...of course we'll call it America.
So you want me to explain why I'm thinking of turning off the magnetic field..
I just rolled in from orbit and boy, is my ozone layer depleted!
I don't care how loud you yell sir, I'm always going to be round.
Wait, you were supposed to come in later!
Time and again my opponent’s inaccurate projections have distorted reality and that should shake us all to our cores.
You’ve no rights because you’re not registered.
I don't care what you say, you're not changing!
Stop parroting liberal talking points!
Hey, there's no need to be snippy.
...and here we see a crazy chicken and a tornado.
Global warming is no excuse for all that hot air.
And here at long last, before you,  is proof of the Southeast Passage!!
My opponent is perfectly comfortable with 3rd place. I say, you deserve better.
My world view?  I see the big picture as if it's standing right in front of me.
That explains the gaping hole in the wall...
I object! My opponent is lurking again.
My opponent seems needlessly hot under the collar.
A flat earth is not really up for debate.
You appear to be as healthy as can be but our industry is polluted from all the regulations!
Obviously,my opponent doesn't even belong in this universe!
And I resent, Sir, the implication that I have just flooded you with a bunch of hot air!"
We now want to kick-off the planetary session of the conference...
You're on sitting on the axis of evil!
During this debate on climate policy I
You will not replace me!
My opponent's foreign policy promises are grossly inflated.
At the top you see the land mass that is causing the system collapse.
I speak for the world.
Don't worry, you've only got the weight of the world on your shoulders.
Watch out world, I'm coming for you!
Now, let's hear from planet Earth herself and her opinions on whether Pluto should be a planet or not. Ms. Earth, can you tell us what you think?
I am *paying* for this microphone!
I have invited my dear friend Mother Earth here to tell you all how great she really feels.
I know you're upset about the receding hair line, we're working on new treatments.
Welcome. Be my guest.
Look at you. You ought to sweat off a few pounds.
And in 2020, I'll be making America even greater.  ALL of it.
Who speaks for Earth?
(And thank you, Carl Sagan, for asking us this question a while ago.)
You win, there is global warming plus global shrinkage.
.....and that's why you are on a stage now.
Tonight, Earth is on fire!
Look! You can see..... " We are the WORLD!!"
WAAA  WAAA WAAA!   All my opponent does is complain!
If I hear you conflate climate and weather one more time, I’m going to roll over you.
Today's hypothetical is God doing a make over."
Now, those running on the Democratic side are…
Nonsense! My argument represents the greater good.
I'm happy to introduce the globe, who will testify that it has a fever.
I am not a resource. I am the World.
Your issues are too big, I can't hear any more.
And do not refer to my opponent as "Homey"!
World, shmorld, after taxes we got what?
Did the dinosaurs vote for that idea, World?
And my oponit claims to have the weight of the world on his shoulders! But”
I’ll agree with one thing my opponent just said: Voters have a critical choice to make next Tuesday.
Yes, it's the first World End, and is only available until Doomsday!
I feel hot
And by 2019, construction was begun on the Great Wall of Canada.
This is not the way New Zealand wanted to get on the map.
They're All against me, every last one of them!
Look I hate to break it to you but if you’re round then that would make me wrong, which is simply impossible.
A whole new world -a new fantastic point of view...
'My opponent is an enemy of the People '
This is the Southland. You can’t express those views.
Hold on a minute, now.  That's just YOUR opinion!
If being wordly, were all  you require, take my opponent.

No matter what the entire world says, I still think it's a Chinese hoax.
I am the Donald and you are not even a grain of sand  in the Universe.
I don't care what you say, I'm right!
I'd like to introduce our keynote speaker, who has a World of comments to share.
My opponent only cares about himself when it comes to his policies.
Thank you Earth for your introduction. As you can see the Western Hemisphere matters and we are going to be great again!
My opponent can't even control his own warming.
My opponent in today's debate is an old friend I haven't seen for 30 years...all I can say is ,it's a small world.....
I'm sorry, where exactly is your mouth? Or your eyes? It's a small thing, but I like to look people in the eyes when I speak to them.
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
AI Maps 4.0 will roll out this Spring
Lord, God, what a majority!

Man has debate with the earth
You're damn right I'll go up against you!
Whoa! The small globe!
My name is Scott Pilgrim.
Your right, but, my wife drives a Prius!
'"You're no ball of fire either."
My opponent wants you to think she looks out all of us. But did you know that billions on Earth are terribly poor — and what's more, they're mostly people of color? So, I ask you this: Who's really looking out for you? Earth? Or me, Pete Buttigieg?
What do you mean Nancy Pelosi sent you to refute the emergency need for a beautiful border wall?
While you do have a very compelling case supporting Flat Earth, I must remind you that your word is "loquacious".
Now, direct your eyes to the big blue ball to my left.
Please wait until I call on you.
My Opponent maintains he's the salt of the earth!
Sure! Lord it OVER us!
And I see that you have  5,972,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of weight on your shoulders.
Except for the commies, not so many s-hole countries in this hemisphere.
...and furthermore, my opponent doesn’t even speak English!
It's ideas like those that let the terra-rists win.
Indiana Jones and The Temple Doomed By Global Warming
Where in the world are we?
It's high time the voice of Earth is heard now.
Your five minutes are up!  Moderator--!
Your lectern was only meant for Al Gore.
Enough hperglobe!
This world's too big for the both of us.
When I said. “What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!” I was just being rhetorical.
I dont care what you look like, I still say your flat!
Furthermore, warmer temperatures decrease my steak grilling time and shorten the time it takes for my bathtub to fill up with hot water.
Look, the earth has come to take revenge on us for taking its polar ice cap, I really want to say I told you so!
And now welcome our special gue... STOP!
That's the classic 'appeal to the masses' fallacy!
Help me welcome our guest speaker - the creator of the Flat Earth Society!
I should at least be King of the Western Hemisphere, if not the whole world!
Welcome to our world.
They come in peace, they’re only looking for water, air and shelter.
Morphing is impressive. But I offer stability!
Please lower your weather.
I don't see Nations! I see Dictators!
Keep your cool! You're not THAT big Ms. Earth.
You don't intimidate me...there is no such thing as climate change.
Act like the whole world is about to judge your speech.
Get real- with the Wall nearly done and 2% of the world's population behind me, why do I need to listen to a bunch of losers like you?
God thought it would be better for it to come straight from the horse's mouth.
Holy guacamole, it is about to burst!
And if we look to my left, I can show you the world. Shinning, shimmering, splendid”
And you, my friend, or a radical environmentalist!
Let’s give a rousing welcome to our keynote speaker, The Global Economy!
Is it true what Beyoncé’ says, do girls run the World?
Trump: There's no global warming as you can see.
I  see right through all those phony warm feelings you're projecting.
Sure, you’re worldly, but I figured out how to keep subscribers signed-into The New Yorker websites!
And now, back by popular demand, put your hands together for GOD!
The next speaker will be satellited in once we have a lnk
I’m Donald Trump!!!
Clearly we are in agreement.  You seem to be warming up to my belief that fossil fuel consumption is harmless.
In conclusion, it's cold outside.
But the A.C.'s on!
I've been upstaged by a prop!
Our next speaker has a world of experience in Human Lack-of-Change Studies.
Man: It's not all about you.
I was thinking much flatter.
I knew America. America was a friend of mine. Believe me, Senator, you're no American!
America is now GREAT! Promise Made, Promise Kept
But can my opponent promise "Free Pizza Fridays"?
Don’t believe Mother. She’s full of hot air!
Some say he’s got the whole world 
on his stand but l know better!
You don't seem to be going around the sun right now.
Yeah, don’t flat-earth yourself.
I'm sure we can all agree ...
Are you sure climate change is real?
I’ve changed my mind. There is such a thing as climate change!
Just another Davos-style globalist.
Cool your rhetoric! Your stormy outbursts will convince no one.
Before you continue, what we’re the dinosaurs really like?
Yeah, but Columbus was a moron, and anyway that don't prove you ain't flat...
World domination is so seventeen century.
And if you'll look here at our 3D map.
You're such a loser.
However, my opponent...
You haven't changed at all.
There you go again...trying to get the last word.
My opponent is worthy, but easily influenced by fake science.
All those running against the GOP incumbent in the 2020 Presidential election, shout, "Facts are not fake news."
And no matter what my opponent thinks...
You may be the entire planet earth, but you're not God. So shut up.
Your points are falling a bit flat
I don't care what her record says; I'm here to tell you that she's been flip-flopping for years.
My sixty seconds isn't up yet!
You say you feel bloated?
Yes an SUV. What are you driving at?"
Apparently there is life on other planets too!
This would be a lot easier if I was flat.
And regardless of the terraqueous knowledge of my opponent...
Does anyone know what this sphere is trying to tell us?
You and whose army?!
i am for peace, where my opponent is obviously for world
Frank lost his job and reputation shortly after his misguided attempt at a “Heavenly Body” joke.

And now we shall hear from Halliwell, our correspondent who is sheltering near that sqiggly line by the Bering Sea.
Just cool off, you hoaxer!!
What my opponent said is wrong, there’s no such thing called “Global Warming”.
It's just not economically feasible!
And now a rebuttal from Terra Cotta
Your head is so big, it won't fit in the continent of Europe!
Today the world is recursive.
All our problems are  here, join my campaign to find a new planet.
And if I am elected that's what you'll get.
As you can see the world is very very bigly.
My opponent's campaign is a one-issue wonder.
Before the Lorax...
At least Pluto is not Flat
My opponent would have you believe the world is his oyster!
May I call you Ted?
They're weren't kidding when they said his speech was out of this world
Your rebuttal?
Stop. I'll go first. Then, it's your turn.

garygcampbell@comcast.net
You come here and accuse me of taking money from Big Oil when you’re no stranger to Big Earth
My opponent is a liar
When Xi speaks America listens
Think global, vote local politician.
Protect it? Please! Don't be swayed by my opponents leftist liberal agenda.
My main rebuttal? The world is not a podium.
You may say that I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will be as one…
Given your history of peaceful debate, I look forward to being slaughtered at the end of this one
And now our sponsor, Earth, Inc. -- working today for a better tomorrow.
And the Lord Sayeth, "America shall have dominion over all the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air."
I suppose you're going to argue that the environment is more important than the environment.
My opponent is racist.
Let me get my lever.
This is God’s view. See how easy it is to see the borders?
Stop! In the name of the Flat Earth Society!
Welcome, Mr. Trump!
They're coming by the millions, folks!
No, no, no. It's not DAIS ex machina."
And finally, we are pleased that Gaia has accepted the position of head of the EPA.
Please....stop globalizing the solution to climate change!
My opponent isn't who they say they are. In fact, I have it on good authority they're nothing more than a Van der Grinten projection.
And if you let them get the Senate and the White House, they'll eliminate all the borders.
Will you just listen to me mother?  Can't you see the world's changing?
The atmosphere in the room heats up as the Green Party candidate is asked about their views on Pluto's legitimacy
You heard what I said...climate change is a hoax!
I knew you'd say, "Proof is staring you in the face", that does not change my argument, climate change is a hoax!"
“Lord save us ... America First!”
Wait, you're not our next contestant. We must have you mixed up with Pangea.
I hereby announce my intention to quit if  you don’t treat me with respect  it’s your call.
The world speaks, yet we acquiesce.
My worthy opponent is clearly full of hot air!
It's all about us
Digital, schmigital! I like tangible.
We didn't come here because of global warming, it was a hoax created by opposition. We came here to escape from Facebook, Google.
My opponent doesn't know the first thing about global warming!
Okay, well hang on a minute Bill, let me finish.
Oh, yeah ? Well, I have dominion!
I present to you.....the world!
Ladies and gentleman...This is your world...
I should have brought back up!
I promise to build a wall to keep out all who do not support social justice in the world.
I just don't see any proof of climate change
Are you going to freeze us or to cook us?
What the hell is going on with Global Waming?
I'll concede that heat causes expansion, but there's no evidence...
Woah, slow your roll! I let you speak about climate change, but I wanna talk to you about global warming!
Okay, is this, like, some kind of Ayn Rand thing? And if it is, should we call an ambulance?
Is this the world on your shoulders?
Your comments mean the world to me!
You've never done one single thing for the American public!
Weltanschauung, Schweltanschauung
Today I invited someone of MY caliber.
Is it getting hotter and hot in here could we mayb-"
"I told you already we are not stopping this debate to get rid of C02!
Really? I‘m sweltering over here, and now you tell me the mike was off the entire time?
Whoa! You need to do something about that cough,
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
Stop the earth I'm getting off.
If you're so round, why are you standing still?
I can show you, The World!
This is your central conceit, Mr. Trump.
With my opponent's all consuming hot air indeed he will blow up our world.
There my opponent goes again, vastly exaggerating the situation."

Or am I taking you out of context?
I tell you, I am as diwn to earth as my opponent.
You had the whole world . Apparently you still have it on your shoulders.
And here we see the famous Macondo projection.”
Give me a break! That's just a hoax invented by the Chinese.
Forget voting red or blue, let's talk green!
You were saying?
My opponent seems to believe it’s a living breathing organism!
The Midwest "Rules
I want to point out that my opponent's fake sunny smile is proof that there is no such thing as climate change.
And on my right, your left, the representative from the Eastern Hemisphere
The snowstorm was a little bigger than we anticipated.
Don't say it!
And on the Seventh Day, we dug the Panama Canal...
It’s about time someone paid attention to me!
And that is why I think the earth is flat
Hello. I'm Donald Trump.
Unlike my opponent, I will NOT play into partisan politics!
The real Inconvenient Truth is that my opponent brought globe for his demonstration that is much too large.
But do you have a Twitter?
It's me or the Earth
We needed a roof, but we just built a wall!
OK, you've made your point!
Ok keep this image in your brain. Now imagine it just a blue ball of water...
It really is a National emergency,we really are being over run!
Cheer up Greta Thunberg,
there is HOPE
As you can see, and as my former colleague can attest, here we have an example of “global growing”!
I strongly disbelieve my opponent's plan to raise temperatures and wash away my ignorance.
No, it is not yet your turn to speak
And now, for a sketchy view of the world...here’s Bob from our art department.
And we're building a moat around our hemisphere to keep the hot air n.
My opponent clearly lacks foresight on this matter...
If every vote counted, he wouldn't be your president.
Holy fucking shit it's the entire Earth and I'm supposed to debate it wtf lol.
I don't care what you science-types say, there are NINE!  Nine planets in the solar system!
My opponent is obviously exaggerated."
Vote for me because I know more than anyone in the whole world!
I WILL NOT BE IGNORED!!!
Try and talk your way out of this Mr. Trump

New Yorker: The Finalists
Well, the debate is nearly over. Man has summarily destroyed the Earth.
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the ocean's carbon graphite level is a serious concern.
I think you're being more than a little hysterical
He's got the whole world behind that stand.  He's got the whole world behind that stand.  He's got the whole world behind that stand.  HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD BEHIND THAT STAND!!!
I am the only person here to speak for the planet.  If it's just me,
clearly we are doomed.
I agreed to debate WENDELL WILLKIE, not his book.
Help me, help you!
The good news is that fossil fuels still have a fighting chance
Just another liberal fake!  Moses parted a red sea.
...and our specials today are Arctic avocado, Tundra tomatoes, and  your all-time favourite — Frigid Framboise.
This appears to make my colleague's argument moot
They said I was paranoid!!
Clarify for the folks what you meant by 'the bubble bursting.'
What is this? A world for ants?
As I filibuster, I feel like I carry the wait of the world.
this bitch right here looking so fat, he's looking so fat that he makes jupiter look like a WHITE DWARF!!! haha but for real, without this guy i wouldn't have a career... so let's hear it for global warming! i love you man, i fucking love you!
The last thing the world needs is more north-centric rhetoric.
There you go again, avoiding specifics!
At the latest debate on climate change: “Upon further reflection, Mother Earth makes a valid point and I will stop driving my car immediately.”
I do not identify this as the earth. The earth should be flat, not like a ball. Every politician knows that.
At the very least we can save this Earth.
You raise a great point.
These globalists don’t care about your or me!
And I say that 70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by Dihydrogen Oxide!
Wall?Wall? We don't need no stinking walls.
I hope the next time I get a chance to have the floor I won't be interrupted.
And now for our TWED talk!
Don't get blown out of shape over climate control.
Don't  judge me!
No, sorry, I can’t hear you.
You have corrupted our youth with threats and false promise!
You and your oceans ... you’re all wet, you’re always splashing and flooding with your waves and your tides and your deep blue sea.  And I intend to put a stop to it!
Here we have a contemporary, three dimensional interpretation of a Michelangelo, two dimensional rendering found on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
Sorry about abuse but we legally have eminent domain here.
You have no proof your stormy misbehavior is due to your alleged fever!
It is my pleasure to introduce the talk
“The minor challenge society is facing today”
Whatever...
The world's stop going round! Guess there was not enough love.
My opponent is my oyster.
Don’t worry about raising the mike. The U.S. always speaks loudest.
My opponent demonstrates an extreme lack of focus!
I stand here at a podium opposite the planet Earth, which is apparently also here to debate.
Granted, my opinion may not coincide with most !
. . . and furthermore, if you don't mend your ways, you'll be obsolete in just a few decades.
In a couple hundred years, this will look like Rodinia again...
I did see your Instagram Story yesterday. I agree with you—the whole wide world is officially out of my hands.
And the biggest loser is!? you guessed it. Us!
With all this green earth talk the world has got above itself.
I´m hot too. But you need to check your temper, Sharon!
This isn’t quite what I pictured when the network stressed that inevitable changes to the debate climate were quite real.
I can't be the only one that thinks it's crazy that a scale model of the Earth is the Democratic nominee for president, right?
That concern is obviously overblown.
And then, God created  Trump.
It seems to be no longer  moving forward.
Yes, of course, there are lots of other women complaining about this sudden heat from time to time. However, this isn't a reason to change everything right now.
Despite what it says, the world’s roundness is a flat-out lie!
HELP NEEDED!  APPLY ANYWHERE!
The forces opposed to my policies may seem imposing, but I am in it to win it.
You're wrong. But since democracy means we are EQUALLY entitled to our opinions, let's just agree to disagree and move on.
Ok we are going to hear from Earth
With her statement that we all agree that it should be Earth first.
MAGA

A--holes
Go

Now would you like to say anything, Afghanistan?
My world is bigger than yours!
My opponent, who is the size of a planet, is clearly a victim of the obesity epidemic.
I am telling you, and you can believe me. It's fake news!  Your atmosphere is not heating up!
Behold the Enemy!
The Monroe Doctrine, my friends, is a mere half measure.
Say the secret word and split an extra hundred bucks between you. Now, I see you two share the same last name. I hope that means you’re married. I have the same last name as my brothers, but we
we certainly never touched peninsulas.
I accuse my learned opponent of being biased on this matter.
She promises you the world, the slut!
I shall now inflate this globe until it displays Earth on a  realistic 1 to 1 scale.
According to science, she's not qualified to lead the universe. She can't manage her own house!
And who in the world can argue with a matzoh ball?
You can't say that. We're unto you.
I live there!
The Last Flat Earther: Refute and Concession.
As you can see the earth is huge.  And some say it's growing.
Another voice heard from
I couldn't disagree more with the Senator from Everywhere. . .
You think you are a World Leader ?
Earth: PLEASE, HELP I'M DYING--
Politician: Ladies and gents, the Earth doesn't understand, this isn't... how WE work around here
Some people deny that there is such a thing as global rolling.
You would say that!
My friends, manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people!
Yes, it is Joel Osteen on steroids.  Praise the Lord!
No offense but I prefer to use Twitter, flush, then run to the oval office to watch Fox&friends.
Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it
Debate me, coward! You won't.
All I said was that the earth is flat. I didn't mean for it to flatten me.
I found this in a box of CRACKER JACKS, now tell me the dimensions of the box!
I don't care how many of you say it, these are lecterns, not podiums!
Wipe that smirk off your face!
Trump! Brexit! The crisis in Venezuela! Lori Loughlin! 
It's all on you!
Earth, there is no substitute.
Ok, you can stop there, you just bowled us over with that argument !
Don't you think your view of global warming is biased? Greg Stroupe Madison, WI
As you can see students, Upper Middlewestern nomenclature notwithstanding, cartographic rendering proves there’s really just one Great Lake plus a Great Pond.
And now will here the world news
Once and for all the world has come to make it case.
Okay can you explain to us why you think global warming is a problem? Mr. uh.. Earth?
Greek mythology often leaves out the finer details behind the "Atlas v. Hercules" debate.
'This might change the landscape of things!"
Don't misunderstand me.  Incontinenance has nothing to do with, the Western Hemisphere, the world order or diplomacy...thus far.
Do you really believe a world gone crazy!
ur big n dumb
The voters can't be fooled. You only care about your worldly possessions.
We neo-cons don't want to hear what you have to say.
Clearly, my opponent is controlled by the Jews.
I'm sorry you are not feeling well and have a fever- if you could just stay for two more questions????
So, what do you have to say for yourself?
And after we leave Mars, we're coming here.
Elect me and I'll take that weight off your shoulders.
And in her first appearance on the global stage, is
a..... um ....ummm.... a ...a globe?
My opponent can say what he will, but if I lose, you lose
So what's really going on with you?
Love, sweet love, is what you say you need.  What I say is that you need to cool down....
Me — I'm local!
You're not what you were, but you're not going to pin that on me or my ancestors. Mark my word it's all about the Sun!
And now, for her reply.
No puppet. You're the puppet!
My opponent cannot resist a eurocentric approach. What a shame.
My worthy opponent is certainly entitled to her opinion. However, as we all know this global warming thing is just hoax.
And now someone who finally got in the game and got incorporated-I give you Earth LLC .
MEGA, the MAGA sequel!!!
My opponent is clearly THE GLOBE
What’s your stance on migration, immigration and migraine nations?
I believe all humans should be equator and endowed to inandesable rights.
Make America Great Again
Senator, you're no Gerardus Mercator.
If U.S. assistance or interventions is needed, speak now or forever withhold our peace.
Contrary to you, I hold that "back to the earth" is a flawed directive. We should be looking for a new world, not worrying about the old.
I say let the beauty of the South Pacific speak for itself!
My opponent may seem like a down-to-earth candidate, but we've unearthed some tapes that prove otherwise.
Don’t interrupt!
He isn't in any condition to come to speak, but he sent this roll-up graphic to illustrate his global one-man-canoe trip.
As your point is...
Hello world what do you have to say for yourself.
Caps off to you, my friend.
Global warming is a hoax and my opponent has never said one word of truth supporting his position!
Recent snowfall covers all!
I say that you're not the biggest globe in the world.
I don't care if you're a part of his 'America First' campaign - you can't stand in as a speaker at the United Nations conference! He'll need to come out from behind the side with Russia on it.
Proof as to why we need a wall and a sharp needle!
You can't believe anything my opponent says -- especially with such a high fever.
Your optics on the world are 'huge!'
Are you even registered to vote?
You think YOU have the weight of the world on YOUR shoulders...never mind.
How in the world , do you think you’re going to defeat me?
You know the answer to this geology question. I see it right there on your face.
We propose to simply snip the immigrant umbilical cord.
Hold on!  How are did you get in here, when we're on you?
And note the umbilical cord through which the blood (i.e. in this case drugs and money) flows - both back and forth.
Holy shit there's a huge globe at the podium. That's insane how big it is, it must have come from a museum of oversized things.
It has no leader.
Climate change is real
I'll stop the world and melt with you.
Don't listen to the big guy,there's no such thing as global warming.
I don't believe in you!
Not again...
The claim that you're well-rounded fall flat in the face of reality, sir.
May our best ever G.P.S. salesman R.I. P.
A few words before you, retire...please...
Stop the world!  I'm off!
The crushing silence from the United States.
Yeah,you THINK you're King of the World...
So class, which is it? 
Round or flat, Pythagoras and Aristotle, or Kyrie Erving and Draymond Green
My opponent would have you believe I am a solipsist!
It's all about inner earth not flat earth.
The US cannot defend its global position.
Stop trying to take over the world!
I think they speak for everyone on this matter.
And I will argue that humanity is most important
My opponent's policies are as flat as his actual shape.
Our friends arguing the other side would like you to believe the world is in fact not flat.
At it appears that Atlas has failed in his main responsibility, how can voters trust him?!
I told you my presentation would be out of this world!
And if you look up there, you'll spot the devil in the details."
That's a gross generalization!
I don't want to hear it!
My fellow  Americans, whatever the opposition throws at me,  you can  be assured that Senator Atlas can handle it.
The Climate Change Debate

"Is it hot in here or is it global warming? I believe I speak for my rollover of an opponent when I say - No."
Even my climate-change-denying, worldly opponent has to concede that Hawaii has disappeared--likely a victim of rising seas!"
My opponent lacks experience, character, worldliness yes, but that's simply not enough!
Sorry..forgot to remove Phil from the speaker list after his country disappeared into the rising sea
Where's Flat?  It's his turn today -- NOT you!!
This guy doesn’t even HAVE shoulders!
No Climate Change! No Climate Change! You’re the Climate!
In rebuttal, I assert that your complaints are fake news!
Nasty planet!
It's either greenhouse gasses or me. Whatta ya got to lose?
Wacky climate changer!...Let me tell you -- Mars could have done a better job
Your Honor, she is clearly hysterical, so not a credible witness.
I take it that you're about to filibuster...
We're planning on going Worldwide, you see.
Go ahead. Try and unearth me.
But you wouldn't even know about this "warming", without us telling you!
I don't care what anyone tells you. Here at the White House you are a square.
You're big now, but wait until the Blobyack Extract Corporation gets done with you.
I want a divorce!
You know you have won the argument when the other side responds with 'Whatever.'
If you put them in the microwave, the warming will cause both of them to explode.
Can you speak with one voice? All I hear is Me! Me! Me!
Back off or I'll call in the Space Force!"
Our next speaker is full of hot air
Global warming?  Thats a lot of hot air.
Annnnnd our next guest speaker has a world of trouble that we all find ourselves in...
You're a solid 5/10, not very hot
Stop!  Every dumb thing he said about warming I'm against!
I knew it! Your flat!
But I was talking to a roomful of small business owners in Iowa...
I’m no puppet!  No puppet. You’re the puppet!
It’s time we start applying term limits to the office of home planet. Vote for me and I promise to increase sunshine and natural resources while lowering hurricanes and gravity. Come live on me, a fellow human, in 2020.
And now we’ll hear from Moby Dick!
Come in Moby …
You're blinded by your side of the argument.
OK, global warming from my point of view.
Beware of an avalanche on the ides of March!
What the hell kind of  a socialist is a “Gaia”?”
Sure, sure, Globalism . . . but what about the other sneaky half?
I am not a bully!
Speaking strictly for myself...
My worthy opponent is Earth, a planet in the Sol System. As you can see it is, of course, flat.
Furthermore, in the Council of Planets, you have no right to claim you have your house in order.
And furthermore
It's just downright rude to say my tie is unsustainable, miss.
Slow down, you’re getting hot under the collar!
It's a big world!
I find your world policies rather hemispheric in nature.
I knew President Kennedy and you are no JFK!
My fellow Americans, the middle section of the upper continent is all we need worry about... All the rest of my opponents concerns are nothing but unimportant nonsense. Why should we care?
Madam Nature, appeals to alternative facts of your status is as fallacious as you are spherical"
My opponent leaked New Zealand.
Mounting evidence suggests a high level of graphite in the oceans and larger bodies of water.
But do you deny a natural bias against my views?
I disagree!
I don’t care IF you’re global, you haven’t said a word all night
You never remember how big was the shits of dinasours. Ofcourse it is easy to accuse humanity for every trouble!
On the other hand . . .
You áre the weakest link. Goodbye!
Ms. Earth, we need evidence not your watery claims.
Before you!
I say no to this monstrosity! These are God-fearing people!
You're my world, you're every breath I take...
Well, actually...
Our toastmaster has been cancelled because the whole world is rolling down hill
This is not the debate I signed up for
And now, with his views on the state of the union, Earthy McEartherson.
Thus, it is obvious that the planet WAS indeed created... by Gahan Wilson.
As you can see, my opponent choose to spend today at the beach
I know my position may position maybe somewhat unique here...
Man made! Well maybe if you'd lay off the forest fires...
Okay, it's me against the world, uh, I mean it's I against the world or the world against I. Uh - what can I say? Geography was my major, not English, I know that's the world. I win.
Whatever you say, my constituents, by their overwhelming approval of me, have proven me right.
The debate on the 'Greenhouse effect' has a new twist.
STOP interrupting me!
Now, are you speaking from the round side of your mouth, or the flat side?
My naïve opponent would like you to think there are positive aspects to El Nino!
I don’t agree with you. Climate change is a hoax.
Once again my opponent delves into more left wing conspiracy.  He PURPOSEFULLY left the AC off during that period.
And when I snap my fingers...
I’m here on behalf of Kanye West
Try to keep it positive.
If I want your opinion on climate change, I'll heat it out of you!
I know you can only speak using the kind of weather you give us, but I'm afraid many of us will continue to irresponsibly take as much of your finite resources as we can unless you strike the fear and wrath of your universe upon us.
Your climate changes far too quickly; you couldn't possibly be president!
My opponent's projection is all wrong.
Calm down, your ego's as big as the world.
....and my opponent is a big fat tub of lard.
I believe my opponent just contradicted themselves.
Please stop getting round your problems!
Point of Information! What's with this global warming?
Now I ask you, all that water—and you think it won't short out my mike?
Uhh so first happy earth day!
I put it to you, you are more than enough...indeed, quite too much
Congratulations sir, I now have the honor of giving you the title of the best person on Earth.
It looks like it you vs. me.
I know it looks like a depiction of huge male genitals at the heart of America, but God gave me this body and it helped me into the White House. Everyone knows that.
I portest. Home court advatage.
I'd like to request Atlas as my second.
I’m PAYING for this microclimate!

Hold it right there! I'm the crazy one?
He's a climate flip-flopper!
An eminent defeat in a flat debate.
I hate to debate with you on this but I'm right and you're dead wrong!

Either you’ve lost a ton of weight or I’ve gained a lot for the two of us to even be comparable sizes.
If you are so frigg'n important, meet me in person!
Wait a minute, what are you trying to say here?
My opponent casts a big shadow for such a short man
Would you just fuck off already?
These so-called "scientist" also claim that my opponent is *not* flat.
Look at this big fuckin' globe!
I don’t think you are correct!!
Global warming is a plot by the democrats!!

Climate Deniers Debating Against Reason
It's a living!
I don't care what you think, my boss Donal Trump, says that Man Made Global Warming is Fake News, so despite the the audience wearing waders I believe him.
I feel I'm at a significant disadvantage, and yes we can be done with platitudes.
Don't blame me, your problem is global warming.
If you listen you will hear the world crying over global warmng
Come on now, don't turn your butt cheeks to the audience.
Ha, you can't rebut that there is no proof of global warning.
And to begin my presentation on chaos theory...
My  opponent has a point, but this is how I will  proceed!
And our next speaker, a man that carries the world on his shoulders, is none other than the electrifying , space exploring, tunnel digging,

I dunno where he is; I asked him a question about his biographer, he shrugged his shoulders, got real angry, started cursing  about makers and takers,  and stomped off the stage.
I do not yield the floor to the gentleman.
Half empty or half full?
The question unfairly favors 
my opponent!
My opponent has a world-wide view of climate change--I think it just takes you or me to make our carbon footprint smaller.
Despite what my opponent says, I promise to keep the fossil fuels industries in business!
Folks, don't let her pull the oceans over your eyes!

No amount of huffing and puffing will convince me that the New Green Deal is anything but a hoax!

The world would like to explain its change of heart, concerning the "greatest country on earth,"  and why it may be most affected by climate change.  
Not so much love, Mother Nature
Lets holdoff on the Golden Rule for now. 
Frank Buckley Andover, MA
...and in rebuttal to Mr. Trump...
And this was before the global warming was heeded.
My opponent seems to be in serious need of a face lift.  And just who, I ask you, is going to be paying for that?
PLEASE! global warming.!?
And now the Earth will reveal us on which planet we are

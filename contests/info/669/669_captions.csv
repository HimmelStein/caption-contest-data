Yes, yes, I mythed you too.
Sorry Puff, but the magic is gone.
Give me a minute while I slip into something a little less flammable.
I’m sorry. I’ve been burned too many times.
Well, if you must know, I'm in the middle of a one knight stand"
I'll be honest with you. It's your breath.
...look, I know that cough was an accident, but they were my parents..
Well you don't look anything like your picture either!
No... I said slay the knight, not stay the night!
Look, damsels say all sorts of things in distress.
I told you, Puff, the magic's gone.
Honey! Your mother's here!
Well, if it isn’t my old flame.
If Mother asks,you're a Jewish doctor under a spell.
Oh sure. Now that Game of Thrones is over and you're out of work,
you come crawling back.
Ever since I kissed that frog, it just never ends
I'm sorry, but it's over between us, you've burned too many bridges.
Oh good. You’re here. The pilot light just went out.
Come around to the serpent's entrance.
I suppose Tinder means something different to you.
It’s not a sneeze when you burn a village, Carl.
Ahh, just in time.  We're making Creme Brulee.
When I said "Toast the King!" I meant something quite different.
I hope that's your tail?
No, I do not want to frolic in the autumn mist.
Sorry,I don't date guys who smoke.
Just so you know, Dad has terrible gas.Try not to set him off.
You seem sweet but I've been burned by guys like you before.
No, I quite clearly said I was a drag queen.
She refuses to leave the castle until her eyebrows grow back.
No, the dragon lady is one moat over.
Looks like we both lied on our dating profile.
Sorry, Puff. The magic is gone.
No, thanks. I've been burned too many times before.
Just five more minutes; she wants to look asbestos she can.
Hold on darling, Let me turn off the smoke detectors.
Wait here while I slip into something a little more flame retardant.
Eat Trump first, then we'll talk about a date!!!
Two puny pansies won’t get me to lift the spell, Gregory.
Is that a tail, or are you just happy to see me?
The gate isn’t the only thing you’re not going to fit into
I've found a new flame.
Are you done fuming?
Do you think you can control what comes out of your mouth this time?
Obviously you’re much hotter than I even imagined.
This is White Castle.  You want the White House.
My old flame!
Hold on while I go change into something more flame resistant.
I only like you as a friend, weapon, and means of travel.
Look I'm not going to tell you again, the restraining order says you have to stay in a land Far Far Away.
Of course we're voting for you!  Anyone but Trump!
Breathe a word and I'm toast.
Sorry, but the Princess only dates toads.
Mom!  Someone from the Trump 2020 campaign is here!
I loved your s’mores, but last night was dark, and I was drunk.
You kiss one frog and all the weirdos come out.
Every time I say yes to a profile without a photo I get burned.
I know your profile says,‘Together, we can set the world on fire,’ but this is not what I was expecting...
It's not that you're a dragon. I'm just gay.
I have to be honest—it’s your breath.
Who shows up naked on the 1st date?!
On the internet you said you were a dragoon.
She said to tell you thanks for the proposal, but we’ve decided to go with solar.
You burned that bridge a long time ago.
If he found out, he'd slay both of us.
It's time you met my family. Mom and Dad will be fine, but watch out for my brother George. He thinks he's a saint.
You are even hotter than you looked on Tinder!
I only date frogs.
Oh! It's you again. I'm waiting for a frog.
It’s not you, it’s me...
Well maybe it is you.
She went with the frog.
There's nothing worse than a woman scorched.
Do you think a few flowers will make me forget about what you did to the drapes?
She’ll be down in a minute, Jeff. She’s just painting her scales.
I thought you died in Season 7, so I got married.
Sorry, she eloped with the frog.
It's not you, it's me. Well, maybe it's the whole fire breathing thing too.
Are you the emotional support animal my doctor sent over?
OK, you can come in, but please try not to sneeze this time.
It won’t work.....our couple name would be DragQueen
I know. I know. But sweetie - the Middle Ages just aren't ready for a mixed marriage.
Please clarify what you mean by “you want to have me for dinner”
Yes, I did say I liked Dungeons and Dragons...
I don't identify as a dragon any more.
Thanks for the flowers, just don't blow me a kiss.
Forget it, I've been burned too many times.
Who shall I say is calling?
But you have such small hands!
Don’t breathe a word of this to anyone.
Just an old flame calling.
Sorry, father says I cannot date a Reptublican whose every breath increases global warming
It's not you. It's just that I've been burned before."
This gives a whole new meaning to the term "a hot date".
When I say I want to feel fireworks when I kiss a guy I don't mean literally.
Frankly, I was expecting a frog.
Nice, but it doesn't change the fact that I said you needed to 'Meet my parents' and I clearly made the 'M' sound.
No can do. Last time I let an animal in, it was filled with Greeks.
One quick thing: My dad doesn’t know you’re black.
My dad will kill you if those are from his garden.
That’s the last time I go on Cinder.
Well yes, my profile did say I enjoy adventure travel and barbecue.
You burned that bridge, buddy!
I like you, really, but I just feel like I'm gonna get burned in the end.
What happens if I say no?
And this is really important - if he asks, tell him you’ll convert.
Flowers won't bring back my unicorn.
I suppose I did ask Merlin to conjure up a hot date.
George! It's for you.
I don’t want flowers; I want you to stop acting like a monster.
Come back later, my parents are having the whole “lock her in a tower” conversation
You're sweet—but I could never date someone who smokes
Sorry, I don't date old flames.
Before I decide, any former flames I should know about?
And whom may I say is calling?
Hold on while I change into my best asbestos!
A fortuitous entreaty; yes I WOULD like to set the night on fire!
I can’t. My husband is already asking questions about the headboard being scorched.
I'm sorry, but you've burned too many bridges.
You look just like your tapestry.
Enchanted, I'm sure.
I hope you brought some protection?
Yes, I am the damsel in this dress.
She’s still in the hospital from the last kiss you blew to her
No thanks. I've been burned too many times.
Look, I already told you. I don't date smokers.
My father wants to know if you're Jewish.
I want her back by ten, and alive.
I see you Jehovah Witnesses have upped your game.
The spark is there... It's the flame I fear.
It's over. I'm dating a fireman.
Oh but Harold, this kind of thing wont be legal for centuries.
With a lair full of gold and jewels, you thought to bring me FLOWERS?
You're sweet but it will never work.  I'm Catholic and you're Reptilian.
No, I specifically asked for Puff the Magic Drag Queen.
Instead of terrorizing the countryside, I was thinking of Thai food and a movie.
Sorry, I went back to my old flame.
Sorry, but I've been burned too many times.
Sorry -- she says she's been burned before.
Newly engaged Princess Hilda was noticeably surprised by the appearance of an old flame.
Big deal. Your heart burns for everything.
Daddy wants to know what kind of dragon has a name like Puff.
Shhh! My parents think you're extinct.
Sorry, I no longer identify as a dragon.
If my parents ask, just say you're an accountant.
I'm sorry, but my father says that I am still too young to be in distress.
Ironically, there just wasn't a spark.
the King is getting suspicious-  act menacing
Hold your fire, I'll get her.
That's a might big tail for such tiny hands.
Try to be inconspicuous. My Dad thinks I'm dating an Italian.
Sorry, your hands are too small.
It's not you, Steve, it's your breath.
She left with Shrek
You don't want me. I enjoy one knight stands.
The wooden horse was more convincing.
What part of ‘nay’
don’t you understand?
Some dates drag on; some date dragons.
It's not you, it's your breath.
You need to be ten feet beyond the moat if you’re going to smoke.
Sorry, she kissed the frog.
Just let me get rid of the frog and I’ll be right with you.
You have a mountain of gold and you bring me flowers?
So you're the "hot" date I was promised?
My family name?...Saint-George...why do you ask?
I would invite you in, but last time things got a little heated!
I don’t think this can work, I’m Episcopalian.
Madame said I am to put the flowers in water and ask if you would be so kind as to annihilate the bloodthirsty horde assembled at the main gate.
I’ll be right back. I need to grab some marshmallows.
Door -to-door cremations?  Wait right there, let me check.
Are you looking for Peter, Paul, or Mary..?
You ate him, didn't you?
Okay, I lied about my age too, but at least I’m not prehistoric.
Pssst....don't forget to mention  to my dad that you're  in med school.....it will make all the difference  in the world....
I’ll be ready in a minute, let me just finish getting distressed
Daddy wants to know if you're Catholic.
You don't look anything like your profile.
I'm almost ready—just let me grab my extinguisher."
You're too late.  She died, the other one flew off and the series ended weeks ago.
If I kiss you again, will you turn back into a frog?
Uh, just tell her it’s an old flame.
George is out on a crusade, so you can come up for coffee.
Wow, you really are a hot date!
No sorry, Trump Towers is just down the road a bit.
Just don't tell anyone I used Match.com
I'm sorry, she went out for the knight.
A fire-breather, eh? Just wait until you meet my mother.
You expecting to stay for the knight?
I don't know ... I've been burned before.
I'm so sorry, no.   I thought your online profile said Dr. Agon!
Sorry she ran off with an old flame.
Yes, I'll blow you a kiss—please don't blow one back.
Can you come back in an hour? Game of Thrones is on.
No, we ordered snapdragons.
I can't go until you give my dad your flight plan.
Sorry, I’ve been burned too many times before.
Sorry, but I've been burned before.
You look nothing like your profile picture!
You fibbed about your career and I fibbed about my species. Big deal. Let me get my purse.
Well you don’t look anything like you picture on Match.com either.
You must be here to see my mother-in-law.
It just seems like the fire is gone in our relationship.
Killing my parents is kind of a deal breaker.
I actually thought you’d be taller.
Nope. Not kissing that.
And whom shall I tell St. George is calling?
Yes, I’m pretty sure they won’t even notice
your nose-ring.
Your late fiance asked me to bring you these.
Sorry, it's your breath.
you're all the same.. you think flowers will fix everything!
You seem like a nice guy but I’ve been burned too may times.
I’m engaged to Puff.
You had me at “kisses like fire.”
You can come in, but Daddy says you can’t smoke inside.
When you say, "let's eat Chinese," do you mean the people or their cuisine?
You must promise to use your indoor voice.
You have to leave. If my husband finds out about us he'll slay you
Well, at least you're not a snake like my last boyfriend
She's tired of you blowing smoke up her ass.
Just hold your fire, she'll be down in 3 minutes.
You're wearing that?
Please make all deliveries at the serpents' entrance.
Burning the village isn't what I meant by "romantic gesture."
The guy I ate wanted you to have these.
I'm sorry, but we're Creationists.
Are you my Uber?
Flowers won't cut it. We're over. I can smell another damsel on your breath.
Sorry, wrong castle.
You burned my castle and ate all my live-stock! Now you think you can just show up here with some flowers and everything will be o.k.?
Your profile picture was a little misleading.
Nessie? Why, she's toweling off as we speak. Just a moment.
Did anyone see you?
I'm pregnant.
I can't keep letting this relationship dragon...
You had me at inferno.
Sure, just kiss you and the the curse is lifted-you think life is one big fairy tale!
I said "Meet my parents", not "Eat my parents"!
I don’t believe in fairytale romances
I'm sorry, but I've met a frog and want to see where things go with him.
I told you already--it only works on frogs.
I'm sorry.  It's your breath.
Come on, Baby, light my fire . . . .
Dad says I can't go out with you.  We have no fire insurance.
I told you it's over. You burned me once, but never again.
Good Morning Mam!  I'm from the Church of Serpentology and I'd like to share a message with you about the joys of bestial transformation.
You stay out all night flying around, breathing fire with your dragon buddies and bring a few lousy flowers to make up for it?
I'm running late - hold your fire.
I asked for a fairy prince, not a fiery one.
Sorry, I thought I was clear. I don't date guys who smoke.
I just don’t think ‘I apologize if I’ve incinerated anyone’ sounds like you’re taking full responsibility.
May I tell the princess who's calling?
I know you’d like to apologize but Mom and Dad are still covered in gauze.
Well, I did make a wish for someone who would set my heart aflame.
Sorry. You've burned too many bridges.
Snapdragons?  How obvious.
If my husband catches you here, he' s gonna slay you.
Well, you don't look like your profile picture either.
Fried eggs on sticks!?!? You shouldn't have!
That better be your tail or you're not getting in here.
You'll have to frolic in the autumn mist somewhere else."
Could you be a dear? The toaster is broken.
Sorry, but my dad says that we are from different nursery rhymes..
Wait a minute, your supposed to be a frog!
No! The princess is not going out with you again until her eyebrows grow back.
It’s over, Bruce.  No use in having this drag on.
It was just a fortnight stand.
It's legal, Puff, Jackie doesn't need you anymore."
Oh, what a surprise! I didn’t think you were flying in until tomorrow.”
I'm sorry - I clearly specified 'non-smoker'.
Aw—you seem sweet, but I'm more of a cat person.
I just can't see us razing a household.
If you were really sorry, you would have brought chocolates!
An extra flower won't bring my village back.
Well, you don’t look much like your picture either.
Sorry. She won't date endangered species.
We"re going to need a bigger moat.
Sorry Dragon, size matters!
This has got to stop! George is getting suspicious.
I'm sorry, but I don't want you to burn me again.
I think my husband is suspicious.  He wants to know why my chastity belt keeps melting.
Everyone lies on their profile.
You just have to accept that you're my ex-flame.
Psst....I'll meet you tonight at Honahlee
The dating app said you were taller.
Well you don’t look anything like your Tinder photo either!
Come back as a frog and I'll consider it.
You looked greener on line
Hot date tonight?
Oh ... Daenerys of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, yada, yada, yada, ... your Tinder date's here."
We just planted those!
You burn down the entire kingdom and all you bring are a couple of flowers??...
Please tell little Jackie Paper that Puff is here.
This is awkward, I'm actually not allowed to date until someone kills you.
Was that an old photo you used on Tinder?
It was fun while it lasted but the flame went out.
If he catches us, my boyfriend will slay you.
Your profile pic was a lot hotter.
I don’t date smokers.
The story always ends badly for the dragon. Are you sure you're up for this?
The prince thinks that I’m in an eternal sleep...That should probably buy us a couple of hours to get dinner somewhere.
I suppose you think this makes up for the last knight?
Are we flying or driving?
You don't look anything like your profile picture.
is that your tail, or are you just happy to see me?
No, this is not Honah Lee and there's no one named Jackie Paper here.
My husband's home...pretend you're here to devour him.
Wait!  You thought I was a unicorn?"
Did you bring protection?
Geez, Dino, not snap dragons again.
You've burnt enough bridges
This is your idea of discreet?
Are you truly sorry—or just blowing smoke again?
My goodness, I thought you were still living by the "Sea."
So you're her latest flame
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't. Who's calling?
I love you too but he'll slay you if he catches us!
I've got to warn you--my husband asked me about the singe marks.
Please accept my condolences. If it helps, your husband was quite tasty.
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's your breath.
Come back in the winter.
I've told you, not until you stop smoking.
Just a heads up that my father might try and slay you
The flowers are sweet; but honestly? It's your breath.
Dragons are so 1209.
Yes Puff, Jackie Paper and I are a couple!
I promise. I’ll change! Just kiss me!
Not with that breath, you're not.
Okay, but if you blowtorch another waiter we’re going home.
Shhh. Mom and Dad don't know yet.
Sorry, George can’t come out to slay today!
I'll be ready in five. I can't seem to get into distress.
Flowers?  Is that ALL?  Did you forget you burned off my hair so I have to wear this stupid hat?
Sorry, but I've been burnt dating guys like you."
When your profile said you spit fire, I thought it meant you were a really good rapper
Look, you seem nice and all, but to be honest, you don't look anything like your profile picture.
I guess we both had too much to drink.  I thought I was kissing a frog.
My profile does say "Size doesn't matter," but really?
I'll tell her no need to blow dry.
I love you too...but my parents just don't understand.
Cave full of gold, and you just bring me flowers?
Thanks but I'm into girl dragons.
You have a cave full of gold and your giving me daisies?
So do you like a damsel in dis dress?
Look, I really really don't want you breathing down my neck.
Burned the village down again, did you?
Yes, his burns are healing...no thanks to you.
Thanks for the flowers, but my profile specifically says non smokers only.
It's not you, it's me... But really it's you. You're a dragon.
you looked much less green on tinder
I am sorry but she is out with Frog today.
When was the last time you bought me flowers Tim? Who've you eaten this time?
Then Puff said, "I'm here to rescue you from Peter and Paul."
Listen pal, once upon a time's up.
I'm sorry, but I need more than a frolic in the Autumn mist.
You looked a lot hotter on the app.
The princess will be ready in five minutes. She’s just finishing up applying the flame retardant.
She says doesn’t want to get burned again.
Did you remember to gargle, remember last time?
Colin, your mother has arrived.
Daddy is very old-fashioned.  He says that if you can't fly in and snatch me the proper way, then I can't go out with you.
Your heart may be telling you to stay, but your tail tells quite a different story.
No. You burned that drawbridge last time
You have a hoard of gold, but you bring me two flowers FROM MY MOTHER'S GARDEN.
Well, you look a lot different in your photo too.
Look, Puff brought me snapdragons!
And who shall I say is calling?
One sec, let me grab my asbestos cloak.
I'm sorry, St. George can't come out and slay with you.
Oh sure, now that your little thrones game is through you come knocking!
Peter, Paul and Mary can't come out to play!
I'm sorry, you must have the wrong fairy tale.
What part of  ‘Restraining Order’ do you not understand?
May I ask who’s calling?
Flowers won't bring back my barbecued cockapoo
Your Tinder account said you were a nonsmoker.
You're not allowed to park in the fire lane.
Should have thought about that before you sneezed on me.
At least put on some pants and a jacket.  I want to break it to my parents gradually.
Oh, not again! For the last time: I don't care what Ancestry told you! I am not your Mother and there's no Pete here!
I'm sorry, the flame is gone.
Dragon Queen"? No, my ad definitely said "drag"..
I'm here to apologize for Season 8.
Is that dragon's breath?
Oooh, I don't know. The last time it took six weeks for my eyebrows to grow in.
That's what you're wearing to meet my parents?
What are you doing here? My parents are home!
You've burned your last bridge, Harold.
I ordered  Baby's breath, not Dragon's breath.
Do you mean it when you say you love me, or are you just blowing smoke?
Look, I had a great time, but I just can’t commit to being locked in a Tower right now.
I think you misunderstood when I asked for a "smoking hot prince"
I'm sure you won't mind, I burned dinner.
She says, "No thanks," but hopes you'll still be her furnace guy.
Are you here for the flower arranging class?
Glad you made it.  We're ready to fire up the grill.
Your photoshop skills are incredible!
Could I use your bathroom?
You have to understand. That part of my life is over.
Sorry, I only date unicorns.
The last time we went, you incinerated the couples counselor.
You can come in but remember no smoking.
She'll be ready quicker if you can blow dry her hair.
I told them you were only staying until the fireplace is fixed.
Pretend you are here to fix the heater
you're too late , she ran off with the Loch Ness Monster
She'll be out in a minute, after she's fully distressed.
You're just in time to help cook supper!
After burning my village you’ll have to do better than flowers.
I'm afraid your old flame has been extinguished...
I expected you to come crawling back once your television career was over!
I'm sorry. The flame has gone out. It's over.
Remember, don't talk about politics or religion.
Sorry but she’s busy curling her tail”
It was just a one time thing. My family still slays your kind.
Would it be too much trouble to put on some pants?
She accepts your apology....she just needs some time to heal. They’re 3rd degree burns.
My profile photo?
I did wish for a fiery romance...
I don't want to burn any more bridges.
If I kiss you, will you turn into a frog?
Uber?
Its gonna take more than smoke and flowers to make up.
For the last time, eating Prince Charming was a deal breaker!
I said she'll be done in a minute .She's on the throne.
You're not you when you're hungry.
Sorry, I've got a new, hotter flame.
Daddy wants to know if you have a job.
My parents say they don’t care if you’re real or not. The answer is no.
I thought I told you to go around to the serpents’ entrance!
Her father forbade her to see you, but she thinks you're hot.
I’m still working on convincing them you’re not a figment of my imagination
Sorry about last night, I know it got a little heated.
It is just the moat! Nothing to be afraid of.
Did you bring marshmallows?
You know I’m allergic to daisies!
Dany, your Uber's here!
First, one thing; the kids, Catholic or Jewish?
Sorry, she let her hair down for someone else.
You just don't really look like your profile picture.
Go away! The frog was just a one-time thing.
I am am not interested in an old flame
So you took "I want a dragon in bed" on my ePrincess profile literally.
Look, the flowers are great but your breath is the problem.
You're great, but the thing is we have central heating now.
After the untimely death of Daenerys, Drogon hits the dating scene.
Won’t be a sec.  She’s applying some fire retardant.
"Please use the serpent entrance."
Okay. Just for one knight.
Snap dragons. Are you insane?
I’ve been burned too many times before.
For the last time, Puff is with ME.
So glad you came early!  We just ran out of propane!
It’s just that you looked a lot bigger in your Tinder profile.
The spark is gone.
I was hoping for s'mores.
It's my breath, isn't it?
Blaze, I told you I don’t go out with any old flames!
Sorry, I've been burned by blind dates before.
I have to admit that I kind of miss the old, terrifying you.
If I may ask, which appendage do you use to tickle a girl's fancy?
I'm sorry, I just don't see myself dating a Scorpio.
For the last time, there is just no spark.
I know it won't work. my parents are republicans
You look scarier in your profile picture.
We shouldn't see each other anymore. I think George suspects something!
Excuse me, but do you have a few minutes to talk about our Lord and Saviour, Godzilla?
You better go.  George is suspicious.
Sorry, I was expecting a frog.
Meet me behind the dungeon.  St. Michael’s here.
Spell or no spell, I'm not kissing you.
Hi, I’m a sophomore at St. George’s High School. I’m selling flowers to help my fencing team.
Shhh.. The prince is here.. Meet me out back.
I’m sorry, she’s still a bit burnt from your last hot date.
Password?
She loves you but is concerned what the children would look like!
That’s all you’ve got for being such a monster this morning?
This is not what I thought my friend meant when she said my blind date was "hot"
It's not me, it's you.
After seeing you kiss a frog, I figured I'd give it a shot.
Only if you convert.
I don’t know. I might get burned.
M' lady wishes me to inform you she is spoken for by another reptile..
Honey, just be you. Go with the fire-breathing passion. Lose the flowers.
Well if it ain't Hot Stuff slinking back after that Game of Thrones girl dropped you.
Sorry,  but I have a new flame.
I kiss you and what happens?
I told you we need to be more discrete!
Are you a vegetarian?
Could you come back in mid-November of 2020?
Come back another time, she's asleep for 1,000 years.
We don’t let the princess go out with anyone who smokes.
We've got a gas leak - can you come back in two hours?
Sorry, wrong damsel. You're wanting the second castle on the left.
It's not only the species thing, but, you're just too big.
Those flowers won't make up for eating my parents.
She says she never watched it and she has no idea who you are.
What part of  “I’m into unicorns” don’t you get?
Honey, I said you should come in DRAG!!!
I told my Dad you’re a doctor. Don’t spoil it!
Remember, there's no smoking inside the castle.
She needs to be home by 9. And you should know that none of us are very happy about this.
How sweet. George never brought me flowers.
I'm also looking for a knight in shining armor. But not for breakfast.
But your profile said you were a non-smoking vegan who loves kids.
Yeah she used to live here but left 65 million years ago with no forwarding address.
We can’t keep doing this. My husband is getting suspicious.
‘I’m as surprised as you are with this Tinder match.
My parents won't let me see you until you quit smoking.
I'm sorry, but my daughter eloped with a unicorn.
Try to understand. She got a full scholarship to Harvard.
Don't blow it.
Oh stop it. You're just trying to get slayed.
Darling, there is no fire in our relationship any more!
I'm sorry, I thought I swiped left.
I’m a damsel in this dress, not distress.
If you think you have a chance with me, you live in a fantasy world!
Get that sexy dragon ass in here.
I told you, we’re through until you stop smoking!
I’m sorry about last night. I just had to vent.
Is the hat too much?
Both: “You don’t look anything like your dating profile!”
She's ever so sorry. Meant to swipe left.
Go away we've cancelled our HBO subscription
It's not that. It's just that I'm allergic to flowers.
It's not your family, Bob. Its your breath!
Can you frolic in the autumn mist in a land called Honahlee?
Sorry! The ad said I wanted 'a little spark', not a conflagration.
My Husband is St. George.  He'll be right out.
Sorry, you misunderstood.  She’s going in drag, not going with dragon.
If you don’t get me home by midnight, Father said he’s gonna get medieval on you.
You're too late. She already ran away with the frog.
Wow, you look just like your profile picture too.
Hold on while I check my fire insurance policy.
Hormones did that?
Tell him I said I wanted him to stop 'dragging his feet' and propose, not send 'a dragon in heat' to propose.
It’s not the dragon thing. It’s the socialist thing.
Let me guess--if I don't let you in, you'll huff and you'll puff.
Its not your age, its the fact that you lied about it!
I told you to pick me up at the back drawbridge!
She's out with Puff right now.
Wait right there - just finishin' up her scales, horns and claws.
Quit dragon my heart around.
They never end up looking like their profile picture.
At least you didn't lie about your height.
be quiet when you come upstairs mom is sleeping
Sorry but my profile said no smokers
Sorry I’m late.  I had to go back for the marshmallows.
It's not you, it's...well, it's your breath.
I've prepared my parents - just don't say anything about your religion.
For heaven's sake, it's been longer than four hours.See a doctor!
About last knight....
No! I've been burnt too many times.
Come in quickly! They’re all jousting.
In a minute, she is slipping into something that's fire proof.
What can that tail do?
Sorry, I'm new to the concept of 'dragon with benefits.'"
um ... about your cat ...
Hi, I am @Prince charming here for our blind date. You tweeted that you like a BBQ knight?
"You're too late.  She's already been deflowered.
Sorry, but they were out of Snap Dragons.
Oh good—I thought it was another hot flash.
I’m quite sorry about the village.  Allergies, you know?
Sorry, you looked much more fire-breatheyer in your Tinder photo
OK. You're not my first dragon!
Flowers? After what you did?
Hold your breath, I'll be right out.
I can't date you. We grew up on opposite sides of the moat.
Sorry, you looked more unicorn-y in your personal ad.
Oh God! I was picturing Barney.
Breath mint?
Are you tailing me?
You're the new neighbor?
Flowers hardly make up for the century of being trapped in a misogynistic trope
Remember not to talk politics at the dinner table.
Sorry,  Jackie Paper isn’t here.
Frankly Dwane, the fire is gone.
Drogon? Next castle over.
We've run out of maidens. Try the castle up the road
Do not blow me a kiss, last time you set the castle on fire.
uhhhh, we were expecting aaa drag Queen
I told you--My parents won't let me date anyone who smokes!
You miss guarding me in that tower?
Two daisies!  You think I'm gonna try to make this work for two stinking daisies?
But your Tinder picture was a frog.
Slide a bathing suit photo, brief bio, text number, and preferred pronoun under the door, please
I'm not falling for that "Kiss me and I'll turn into a handsome prince" line again.
Oh, hi! You’re a little early …I’m not quite distressed!
But what if St George finds out?
Is this really as good as it gets?
When you meet my Dad, please don't blow him away.
If I say yes, next you’ll want strings and sealing wax.
I think I would have remembered if you mentioned ‘dragon’ in your profile!
Sorry. One knight only.
With that breath you're going to have to come with something better than flowers.
Would you be willing to convert?
I think we should scale back our relationship.
Carole, your date is here!
You’re so much better  since you started anger management classes.
Poppa wants to know what happened to the three other suitors.
It was a wonderful 100 years, but it's time for us to move on.
It's always snapdragons with you!
I heard that line last week from a frog and it didn't work out then.
You have my promise that I’ll only smoke outside .
I'm here for the guard job.
sorry, I just invited St George in for the evening !
No, we can't date.  My mother says I'd have to be a New Yorker subscriber to do something that stupid.
Give me a few minutes to get rid of Prince What's-His-Name
After the stunt you pulled at King’s Landing?
Oh my gosh - I thought your Tinder picture was a joke and I swiped because I thought it was funny.
Some flowers for you, Ms. Paper. Is Jackie home?
I didn’t want to hurt you, but it’s your breath.
I think she’s out riding your brother.
I'll wait for the frog
Your profile stated that you were a non-smoker.
Come around to the back...the King is still in the dark ages about inter-species dating.
Sorry, fresh out of maidens.
Are you here for Nessie?
I think we should stop seeing each other. 
To be honest. It's your breath.
You always promise to quit smoking, but you never do!
Fire away, but you and I are history!
Stop dragon my heart around, George.
Smoke signal me.
Haven't I told you it's against our policy to date former employees?
I may be cold blooded, but I have feelings too!
No thanks, prom was quite enough.
Sorry, Puff picked her up half an hour ago.
Well alright but you’ll have to leave the flowers outside, they give me hay fever.
Jackie's family moved to Honahlee
They're really sweet, but did you have to eat the florist?"
It’s too late for flowers-after all, you ate father...
They moved.
Try next door.
Wait a sec while I check to see who ordered the snap dragons.
It will take more than flowers, buddy
What prom?
Sorry, I don’t date smokers.
The Morning After The Knight Before
Wrong house, the Targaryen's are next door.
She’s not home.
Wrong princess. See, your GPS is pointing the other direction!
I told you before. No flowers.
What did you expect from a tinder date?
Dad says he is totally fine with you being a dragon.  He wants you to know he has a number of dragon friends.  He says I can not go out with you because I am only 15.
Please get it through your head. The daughter of the mother of dragons is still your sister.
Would you care to come in for a knight-cap?
No I am not the dragon queen!
My dad says it's too soon for a sequel.
Here we go. First you show up with flowers and that look on your face, then my fire insurance premiums go through the roof.
It's just that "non-smoker" on your profile might be a stretch.
M'lady is looking for a good match, not a full blown flame thrower.
I tried to love you, but got burned every time.
Amazon delivery
To be honest, “Because you never bring me flowers” was not the only reason I don’t think we should see each other any more.”
I'm sorry... I just don't have the same fire-in-my-belly feelings for you.
I'm sorry, but the Dragon Lady is not in.
The princess can't see you anymore. She didn't know you were a smoker.
I told you to use the back door!'
If I wouldn't kiss the frog, what possibly makes you think I'd kiss you?
I can go on a date. As long as it's not at your house again"
You look so different from your online photo.
Did you drink enough water? I don't want another 'incident'.
I don't think I'm going to be able to sneak you in through the window
I can't help you with spin-offs. You'll have to talk to HBO.
My father is still upset that you laid waste to his kingdom last week.
Meet me around back in 5 minutes but DON'T let anyone see you.
You look taller in your photos.
George wants to know if your intentions are honorable.
You're perfectly nice, but I was expecting smoking hot.
Word to the wise -- she's dating Saint George.
Is it ever a good idea to get back with an old flame?
She's not here, the series is over!
No, Puff, Jackie doesn't want to come out to play.
The knight may be dead,but the night is still young.
No, she lives in the cave behind the castle.
Gotta go, dad.  I've got a hot date!
She told me to tell you she’s washing her scales and can’t go out tonight. Try another time. But please call first.
She says not tonight. She's molting.
Did you quit smoking?
She says, you are not her type.
Oh my, the florist screwed up the dragon lily order again”
I'm sorry, but after the disappointment of Game of Thrones, I'm just not ready.
My husband George is due back from the Crusades today, so I can't see you any more.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
Bad news. He’s suspicious of the scorch marks on my neck.
M'lady will be right out. She's still putting on fire retardant.
Do you know that your subscription  to the New Yorker is about to expire?
Should I wear heels?
Daisies, really? You burn down our entire village and destroy all of our crops, and you bring daisies?
I'm sorry. I don't date my hallucinations anymore, and neither should you.
Hey, Daenerys, your  ride’s here!
I'm sorry, we're no longer taking applicants for the position.
You’ve burned me too many times before.
My heart says yes but my exterminator says no
I don’t have time for an old flame right now.
I'm not sure what you mean by "tinder", but it doesn't sound like something you should be playing around with.
St. George is not in. Did you have an appointment?
No, you’re not forgiven. You singed my eyebrows.
You had fewer scales in your profile picture
Your Uber Air is here.
Don't know if you remember me, but the last time I rained hellfire down on your kingdom, I thought we had a moment...
... and that, children, is why you should always take dating app profiles with a grain of salt.
There's just no spark between us
"First, you have to do something about that breath of yours."
I'm really more of a knight person.
You look a lot different in your profile picture.
The flowers are a nice gesture, but we can't go out if you breathe fire at any man who looks at me in public.
I ordered a frog.
Daddy's wise to us!  He noticed my burnt lips.
You burned down the entire village - I don’t think petunias are going to cut it this time.
Come around after dark. I'll leave the drawbridge unlocked.
I am Jacqueline Paper now Puff.
Hang on, mom just told him you've got an M.B.A.
It will never work Smaugy-Poo. I’m a wealthy princess and you’re...you're a Sander’s supporter.
It was a tail pic?
Dungeon visiting hours are over.
You can't just show up in the middle of the night and expect to get "slayed."
Sorry, my father won't allow me to date across species lines.
Sorry, I’m just not interested in courting disaster.
How many kisses will this take?
"Hi, we met on MATCH.COM".
I'm afraid I've been changed into a woman.
You don’t look much like your profile photo either.
I do need to be back before the knight comes.
I’ll see if she’s ready to be devoured.
OK, as long as you smoke outside.
The princess says, "Thanks, but you're not my species."
Let's go to yours. I've just had smoke alarms installed.
The wine didn’t work , neither will the flowers Ralph.
Shhhhh!  Sneak in through my bedroom window.
Quiet, I haven’t told my parents about you.
Sorry, but the spark is gone.
Again, my parents forbid it.  You're not Jewish.
I know you've been burned in the past, but...
You don't look anything like your profile photo.
I was expecting a frog
Oh, you just look so different from your profile picture is all.
I'm a little taller than I said I was on my profile...
We have to stop meeting like this... people will find out.
I just wanted you to light my fire.
You're too late!  I've already kissed the frog.
No, Cathy's at a different castle.
I'm afraid my mother-in-law is out.
I’ll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for this wedding.
Dany said to tell you, now that the show is over, please leave her alone.
Do you have time to hear about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?
Ever since you ate her cat she doesn’t want to see you!
Puff! Not now, my parents are here.
I’m sorry. Smoking is a deal breaker.
Good grief; the costume party is next week.
My parents are afraid they'll never see the grandchildren.
I’ll tell her you’re here but I doubt that a few flowers will make up for the singed eyebrows”.
You seemed taller in your profile picture.
Just flowers, no candy?
We’re simply incompatible.  You keep incinerating all my favorite places.”

Robert Van Brocklin, Portland, Ore
I’m sorry, it’s not you, it’s me.
The princess is out with a frog.”
Sorry... It's not you, it's me.
Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons?  Two sets down on the left.
What happened to the frog I was supposed to kiss?
Look, I told you, bad breath is a dealbreaker.
OK, here it goes. In retrospect, I see now that it wasn’t a nice thing to incinerate the prince and I admit that a lot of it was, you know, maybe my fault. But I’d like to, I guess, sort of... apologize?
The eggs have hatched, two boys and a girl. You can come in now.
OK. But if you don't turn in to a prince by midnight I'm going to get dressed and leave.
I'm sorry, but ever since the Renaissance kicked in, nobody believes in you anymore.
Well, I’m willing to accept that a knight in shining armor is a cultural myth.
I’m the mother-in-law of dragons.
Milady Dragon, Sir Lancelot sends his regrets from deep inside
You can't destroy my entire village and think flowers will win be back
…I didn’t want to hurt your feelings, but yes… it is another dragon.
She said something about a fire drill...
Well, look what the cat 
dragoned in.
“No thanks. We've already had a free home security inspection.”
Go away...you're not supposed to show up until the season finale.
You burned me, it's going to take more than a few flowers to win me back.
I’m sorry Puff!...But the magic is gone and I’m NOT moving to Galilee!
NEXT!
I'm sorry, but she met Godzilla yesterday, and you know ...
I'm sorry. I swiped right by accident.
Sorry, the Targaryens moved out 6 weeks ago.
I’ll see if George is at home
Yes, I had a lovely time, but no good-night kiss until you do something about that breath!
Maleficent, it’s for you...
Okay, you can come in but, whatever you do, don't belch.
Because it wouldn’t be a date. It would be Stockholm syndrome.
Before we go, Daddy wants to show you his sword collection.
Your dino.com date is here.
Frankly, Harvey, I don't believe you've really changed.
Remember, absolutely no fire breathing.  My folks are really into ending global warming.
That's not my tail honey
I think we should see other dragons.
She said, 'did you ever hear the phrase, 'when hell freezes over?
I don't know him, but he looks like a hottie!
Aaaahhhh - what do you do with that tail?
Look, I'm sorry you're all hot and bothered but now is not a good time.
shhh...my parents can’t know you are here!
Aw, you slay me, you really do.
It's your fantasy, not mine.
Not so sure I am ready to have my heart melted.
Oh my, I thought that dating site photo was a joke. I will need to withdraw my "Like".
Sorry she meant to swipe left.
You're in the wrong nightmare.
Terribly sorry, I meant to swipe left on my magic mirror.
Wow, you didn't look this tall in your profile picture
Both our profiles said we like pointy stuff.
I'm sorry, the current administration is not accepting any new asylum seekers.
She's happy to hear that you are over your cold, but she is still recovering from one of your sneezes.
Come in.  He will be out most of the day on a quest.
...and stop calling me Daenerys!
No wonder you wrote, "The ladies think I'm hot."
At first I thought it was heartburn, but actually I'm pregnant.
Before I take you to dinner darling, I need to use the Komodo.
I'm actually ready to see other people
You gargled this time, right?
Mum’s kind of a nudge.  She’s wondering if you could maybe do a couple of quick flyovers for the kids and, if you don’t mind, take care of cooking the steaks.
Fine. If you want the truth, it's your breath.
This courtship seems to really... drag on.  Ba ha ha ha! But seriously, go away.
I heard you like bad boys and, not to brag, but I just set that village on fire.
So, if I kiss you you'll turn into Prince?
That's very sweet but she died 100 years ago.
I’m going to have to sneak you in!
When I read your profile but about “setting any woman on fire” I didn’t take it literally.
She said to tell you she's washing her spikes.
I’m sorry. My parents just don’t want me dating someone who’s not Jewish
It may have been unfair, but he always wanted to be cremated anyway
You think two flowers will atone for torching the wrong army?
Could you step inside and warm the place up a bit. It's awfully damp and cold.
I just don't believe you quit smoking
The flowers are nice, but let’s get this clear. You’re here to set things on fire and occasional give rides to the children. Nothing else!
We'll have to be quick - my knight-in-shining-armor is taking a nap inside.
It was great, but it was just the magic of the autumn mist, or maybe all the weed.
I’ve seen this in a Monty Python movie.
I just think we've lost some of that fiery passion
My mom sent me over to apologize for ruining your party by setting all your guests on fire.
Yes, I'm holding a grudge.
Me thinks you are really hot, but I burneth for another.
This my first online date.
She's still recovering from the burns.
Trust me, I changed!
Correct, barbecue the meat, not us.
But what about your old flame?
Frankly, it's your breath.
State your intentions. I've been burned before.
I told you: what happens in the Enchanted Forest stays in the Enchanted Forest!
Yeah, yeah, the frog told me the same thing...
Lay low until he sallies forth.
But first, wipe the soot from your nostrils.
What do you mean I don't look like my Tinder profile?
Sorry she eloped last week with a frog!
Watch out! My old boyfriend is looking for you!
Well now I'm certainly not feeling the damsel in distress thing.
George!  Need you down here ASAP!
Can the princess come out to play?
I know she'll appreciate the flowers. I'll see if Cersei wants to come out to play.
Good timing he just left for the crusades. But, i'll only let you in
if you promise to control your breath this time.
I sent you to the store for flour, not flowers!
Oh my... Your profile didn’t mention anything about the tail.
Its not you, its me. I like someone a little edgier and more dangerous.
I was hoping for a wrist corsage
How now! 
 I ordered for mine wedding 
 a Veil not a Tail 
 and flowered Wagon not Dragon. 
 All becometh towering ruins by Auto-Correct!
You'll have to use the back entrance.
My parents would accept you more if you had a contract with HBO.
Drago, after last time, I hope you're not even vaguely considering make-up sex.
But no nostril-flaring this time.
She's at the lake.
I am not a damsel and I wasn't in distress until you knocked!
No, there's no Khaleesi here.
What have you done to George?
She'll be down in a few minutes, she's trying to find shoes to match the asbestos gown.  Nice flowers.
Not now!  George is in.
After all these years, I wanted to let you know that I love you. And I made reservations at 6:00, so get ready.
I can't see you anymore. George is getting suspicious.
The king also invited my old flame.
I promise I’ll never forget our anniversary again.
OK, but it will have to be quick
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it turned out to be Stockholm Syndrome and not love.
I would invite you up, but my home owner's insurance won't cover flames of passion.
I shouldn’t have clicked ‘hot date’.
Y’know, once in a while it would be nice to see some fire.
Only if St. George comes as a chaperone.
I'm sorry but it's...   It's your breath!
Theme party huh ?
And just what part of “NO “ didst thou not understand?
My Dad said you were a myth and I should stay away from the wine cellar.
I’ve been catfished before, but this is ridiculous.
She cherishes her memories of the blasted cornfields and charred villagers, but now she wants some time to reimagine her life.
It’s not you, it’s me!
So, that's one flower for every eyebrow you singed? Not much of an apology.
I know I can come off as hot headed sometimes...
He’s still here!  Blow some fire and act angry.
You have the wrong house. Khaleesi lives next door.
What part of "No way" don't you understand?
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are saying - we don't speak Welsh
I meant it when I said you are really hot in bed ... but trust me, you don’t want to meet my family. The St. George’s are pretty conservative.
The affair would cost Anne Boleyn her head, but for a brief, shining moment, she felt more alive than ever.
Wow... the #MeToo movement has REALLY made a difference
You think some lousy flowers will make up for how badly you botched the finale?
Woke or not, I’m not going.
That's pathetic. Bring back your weight in gold.
Oh sure, flowers COMPLETELY make up for missing the last 3 months of child support.
We've progressed a lot in the past few years, but not this much.
Dungeons and Dragons is more than a game — it’s a lifestyle.
I'm sorry, Fred. I just don't feel the fire anymore.
You'll never be more to me than an old flame.
I’m more into unicorns.
We both know your first love is arson."
So I guess we won’t need an Uber.
Not tonight. I'm grounded
Tell the Queen that her prodigal son has returned.
You look different from the photo on your profile.
I told you, that one time was just to make my father angry.
Dragon Lilies, Steve, really?
Let me check if she's decent.
Not until you do something about your breath!
I already told you this will never work. You’re simply from the wrong side of the moat.
Sorry I am late. My flight got delayed.
You're two ice ages late.
For me?
I told you I’m not a virgin!!
She’s not here right now. She’s out with a horse from Troy.
No sorry,  this is castle 3C. You want castle 3D.
I'm sorry, I should never have gone on Cindr.
Jackie Paper? He's long gone,Puff. I heard he became an accountant and moved to Pougkeepsie.
I'm a drag queen, not a dragon queen!
But I was supposed to kiss a frog!
I think you're looking for Dragonstone, two castles over...
I'm sorry. Saint George is out.
When they told me you were a hot date, I didn't take it literally.
She told me to tell you it's over, she's dating a unicorn now."
I have no use for a flower bringing dragon.
This has to end, you’ve burned me one too many times.
It's not yours.
Please don't breathe a word of this — I can't afford another fire insurance hike.
It isn’t you. It’s me.
Nope, no damsels here.
Look, this isn’t a date or anything, I just need you to light the grill for me!
If I kiss you will you turn into a prince?
You might want to consider updating your FaceBook photo.
Actually, I ordered a *wagonful* of flowers.
Come on in. My father's off reigning someplace.
But where's the drama? You're just a dragon, standing in front of a girl...asking her to love you.
I can't see you any longer. It's not your species, it's your politics.
Just to warn you, she's still very hot.
Your profile picture was wildly deceptive.
Sorry, we're just not compatible.  I mean -- you're a Republican!
Go wither thy tale pointeth, as my Father, the King, hath declareth thou be too old for me.
'I appreciate your thought,but you know that you are an old flame!"
She doesn’t want to see you. She’s still hot after your last date.
I always imagined you as being more assertive.
Dad says I can’t go out until he sees your car.
Not until you leave your wife.
You call it passion, I call it fire.
My father says I can't date dragons.
Hi Mom, I’m home!
Size really is everything.
The family of the knight you cremated has requested a donation to The United Way in lieu of flowers.
You know the is a meet and greet, not a meet and eat.
Did you pick those from MY GARDEN?!?!?
Got a light?
I can't be the damsel to your distress anymore.
I'm sorry, but I have a new hair dryer.
Not now, his Lordship just arrived !
Now you tell me you're allergic to flowers?
You don’t look anything like your online photo.
So sorry, we already bought flowers from your competitor.
This is unexpected, you look exactly like your Tinder profile.
After your 'toasting' the host last night, you think flowers are going to fix this?
You looked bigger in your profile picture
We were expecting the refrigerator repairman.
Are you finally ready to stop burning bridges?
You look different in your profile picture
It just won't work Puff. I'm a Hulu gal and you're an HBO guy.
Okay okay I will tell her you brought flowers
Are you expected?
Sorry but I'm allergic to daisies
He'd like to borrow a cup of lighter fluid
We can not see each other anyomore....it’s your breath!
I'M SO GLAD YOU WON ME. THAT KNIGHT  WAS A BEAST!
I'd know my baby boy anywhere. We have the same tail.
I told you to stay away from here. He will slay you if he finds us together.
So, Cosmo was correct: Mr. Right is a mythical creature.
Hello handsome! I was thinking...maybe for a change you’d like to have a quiet knight in?
Daddy says that you're from the wrong side of the realm.
OK, but I don't like breathing fire on a first date.
Did they tell you to do this at your anger management classes?
Are we walking or flying?
You USED to bother kidnapping me.
She'll be right down. The asbestos base took much longer than she thought.
I'm going to send out my 'Brave-ish Knight!'
The only thing stopping me from committing is your breath, it's killing me
I'm sorry but you have burnt all your bridges here.
You don't look like our regular 1-800-FLOWERS delivery person.
Go back and tell them I ordered "flour."
Come back later. St. George just dropped in for a drink with my father.
I thought I told you to come to the back door.
I told you to be careful with the Viagra.
Oh Gordon, it could never be, I'm Episcopalian.
A pilfered poesy is no apology for incinerating a thousand peasants!
Hey Godzilla, your dreamboat is here.
The griffin used to bring me a whole bouquet back when we were dating.
We're not OK until you apologize to Mother and replace all of the singed curtains.
Sorry, she’s already out on the town with the unicorn.
You’ll need more than that to rekindle our flame.
The Princess said she's moved on.
But I'm free if you want to talk
Oh, please come on in. I want you to meet my brother, George.
Kissing a frog was bad enough.  But this?!
The king does not believe in mixed marriages.
I'm sorry, she's not here. Can I bring you someone else?
I think Lancelot is onto us.
It's over!  The fire is gone between us.
You’ll need to wait. Some girl named Dorothy is here with some weird friends.
It’s got a lot to do with your breath..
SH...Come around the back.  I don't want my dad to see you.
I've been catfished."
Are you Uber"
I appreciate the gesture, but you just don't set my heart on fire.
St. George will be thrilled.
Sorry, I thought you said you were a dragoon.
I’m sorry, but my Tesla’s just more fuel-efficient.”
I'm so sorry, Alvin. I don't date smokers.
Apology accepted. Now, run along before the White Knight gets home.
Oh... uh, hi. Ali is getting ready and will be out in a moment. Meanwhile, tell me, what do your parents do?
I'm his wife.
Your condolences for the knights untimely death are appreciated, but now is not a good time.
I was given to understand you'd be a frog.
The flame is gone. Flowers can’t fix this.
Sorry. We’ve already got one.
He’s gone out, we’ve got about a half an hour.
The fire's gone out of the relationship.
This is 1475 AD ... I believe the party is at 1475 BC..
She'll be down in just a moment. Why don't you come in and meet Mr. Dragonslayer?
First, do something about that breath.
Are you here to apologize for your beastly behavior?
Forget it, Roger. I don’t date old flames.
Honey, I swear, you're the only one that sets me on fire.
I'm sorry, but the fire has gone out of our relationship.
We have to talk...I'm pregnant.
We have to be more discreet - I'll meet you at the pub tonight where we'll blend in with the crowd!
He has not quite yet recovered from the burns.
Well, it's a start.
Deliveries are only accepted at the rear drawbridge.
Sorry, but now that Game of Thrones is over,
 she's just not that into you anymore.
Not now!  My father's home.
I’ll tell her you’re here.
OK, I'll be honest. It's your breath.
Well, you don't look like your online dating photo either.
But Karen, he brought me flowers this time instead of a charred baby goat. Maybe he’s ready to settle down!
Sorry, I have to wash my hair.
She's been burned one too many times to love again.
That's not what the fire emoji means, we're over.
You look different than your Tinder picture.
My father wants to show you his sword before we go.
You think you hoard all our gold, burn down the village and eat my sister and that bouquet will make up for it?
Wally, it's over.  Still, we'll always have Paris.
Sorry but you looked way smaller on your profile pic!
The Game of Thrones is in the next set.
Not until you give up smoking.
I’m sorry, George is not in.
But if I kiss you will you turn into Donald Trump?
She says there has been a misunderstanding and that she had requested  ONE DRAGOON!!
You snoring almost burned the house down and you bring daises?
She'll be ready in a minute. She's just having "the dating chat" with her dad, St. George.
How to you say 'Games of Thrones Unemployment Office?' in dragon?
I'm sorry, Stanley, it's over. Nice guys don't burn up villages.
You just missed him! He's gone out to slay you.
Shh, the prince is here now! I told you Wednesdays and Weekends!
I'm sorry, but the princess flew off on another dragon yesterday.
I'll let Rapunzel know that she doesn't have to let down her hair this time.
It’s the fifteenth time you’ve apologized, we only have two more knights left.
You said you were 6'11 on your profile not 11'6.
Would it be too much for a first date if you just abducted me?
Sorry, but you left me in distress one too many times.
But how would we raise the children?
Shush.  St. George is here.
Sorry, I only date Non-smokers.
A few minutes more. She’s watching ‘Game of Thrones.’
Your not dragon me out of here tonight.
I'm sorry, she just left with her other flame.
I'm slayed.
Oh, Drago. Where the hell art mine fire extinguishers?  Deny thy species, and meet me at the balcony.
I’m sorry. I need a man with more fire in his belly.
She'll be right down and I want her home by eight. Not ate!
Is it too late to swipe left?
You’re not planning to take me up the Empire State Building, are you?
I'm just a boy-ish, standing in front of a girl, asking her to love him.
Psst... I think you got the White Knight's script by mistake.
Dragon breath was not a compliment.
The flowers are pretty, but that is a breathtaking gender symbol."
Go away! I told you that my parents would never understand.
Well, aren’t you looking dragonair.
OK, but no firebreathing or petting on the first date
Sorry, but we don't subscribe to HBO.
I love you, but your breath...
If my dad asks, your favorite movie is Dragonslayer.
Of course I love you, but it would be much better if you came back tonight after everyone's gone to bed.
For the LAST TIME, Tommy left here years ago and he took his sealing wax with him!
I'm so sorry! The is the PENdragon's castle. The Dragon's castle is on the moor beyond the fen.
Well this isn't who either of us was expecting
Happy Mother's Day!
Oh Fred, Daddy says I can't date immigrants.
Ok but if I say well done don’t get any ideas
It was hot until it was not.
If the chocolate melted, why is it all over your lips?”
Mr. Trump says you're not his type.
You take Tinder quite literally, don't you? Still glad I swept right.
You smell nice, but the finale still ruined it for me.
You must be here for my brother.
Oh my god, you're such a drag
Is now a bad time?
Ooh, fabulous! I’ll get a vase for those. He’ll be so pleased you’re here!
I was expecting St. George.
The King told me to tell you to leave. He does not consider you hot stuff.
I told you, it was just a one knight thing.
Knock it off Clyde.  You're not the first one to come singing "Stop Dragon My Heart Around" you know!
I only want your friendship. And occasionally a ride.
Just ignore my father --he used to be a knight.
Sooo... two castles that way?
You burned down the East Tower,  flowers aren't going to cut it!
You are not a frog...this isn't going to work...
Why, Princess Estrilda, it's one of your old flames!
Sorry, your show was cancelled.
Thanks for sitting down to hear the bad news that my new boyfriend is a real prince.
Mothers day was last month.
Go ahead and circle the castle. My parents didn't think you'd show.
I was thinking, ‘better the devil you know ...’
You must go! The rabble will never understand our love.
Come in
Honey, now that Game of Thrones is over I won’t have to travel for work anymore.
She's in the dungeon - roll 8 or higher.
She doesn't want to see you.  She says you have dragon breath.
Oh, great, my Uber’s here.
Um, aren’t you supposed to be a frog?
When you texted that you had been in ‘Game of Thrones,’ I was thinking more along the lines of Richard Madden.
Our wedding would get crazy likes!
Sorry, but I’ve heard about your dinner dates.
You must leave the garden, dear .Your serenading has become a fire hazard.
You know I don’t like roses!
Thank you, but we have all the huffin, puffin, fire breathing nonsense we need for the day.
You know I’m allergic to snapdragons.
You don't look anything like your picture.
It will never work. You're too fiery for me.
You'll find her in the tall tower at the back
Thank god, the prince slayer.
well, at least one of you three remembered Mother's Day!
This is a Disney House, Universal is the next castle over the ridge!
Your sweet Carl, but it’s all about the fire...where’s the fire?
O.K.,but wipe your feet.
Is it Mother’s Day already?
Don't be afraid. I'm Puff, looking for a friend.
Thanks, Puff, but those aren't the botanicals I was expecting.
A GPS tail.Cool.
She's not in. I'm her mother.
I don't think I specified dragons on tinder... but come on in
Sorry, you're just too hot for me.
I'm sorry Beowulf; your mother's here.
Oh, I thought she said her date was draggin' her to the prom.
I really like you but this is a non-smoking kingdom.
Of course they're for ME! - You've eaten ALL the others!
Your profile said you're looking forward to a hot night out on the town.
Charles! I’m still not talking to you, you ate my horse. Remember?!
I’m considered handsome, and handy at cookouts!
She thought you'd be ridding a white horse.
I'm Sorry. The princess thought you were a frog.
Sorry - George is at knight training camp.  I’ll let him know you stopped by when he gets back.
I'm sorry we can't continue to see each other after the president's ban on interspecies relationships.
Wait for me down the moat...the prince is still yammering on about “rescuing” me.
It was a great knight, but that's all it was.
Sorry. My dad says I can only date within my species.
You overheard the Fairy Tale Wedding part correctly, but I said with a Sire Breeding Pagan.
I need fire power not flower power.
You looked a lot different on your profile pic.
I’m sorry she’s busy kissing toads.
This won't work until you do something about your breath.
You tried to eat me... So no, apology not accepted.
Come in, George just  left.
I'm sorry. It's just that my sister was expecting a frog.
Flowers?! Oh, Draco, you slay me.
Close! Cinderella's is three castles down on the left.
But I hope we can still remain friends.
The flowers are sweet, but you look nothing like your profile photo.
Can we wait till things cool down?
My folks will just never accept a mixed marriage.
DON''T sneeze!
Two flowers? Grendel brought me chocolates!
It's over. There's fire in your belly, but your ass is dragon.
Game of Thrones is over....OVER!
But I have really  been working on my anger issues.
Hi Puff, I am afraid the magic is gone, 
but I will take the flowers to her.
Note to self: profile photos can be misleading.
She's putting on some sunscreen. You singed her eyebrows on your last date.
I'm really sorry, our dragon is in the mountains on vacation.
No. You've burned me too many times before.
Not now love. Wait until the king goes out looking for you.
I’m sorry, Bruce, I really am. But it’s over. We’ve just grown in different directions.
Season Nine: Act One, Scene One
Gee, you sure you don't look like your photos.
Well look what the cat dragon."
That's better, but when are you seeing the doctor about your breath?
I think you want Khaleesi's place, two doors down.
C'mon, you ate the Prince. Give me some time.
Have we met?
This isn't a good time. My parents are still mad about the village you burned down.
You looked taller in your Tinder profile.
Sorry, she went out with Barney.
You told me to scale down on the gifts.
Your photo is a bit out of date I see.
Goodbye, Algernon.
I',m sorry; you just don't look anything like your profile picture...
You're Dragon my heart around.
Couldn't you have just sent a text?
No, no. Come back to see me tomorrow afternoon when George will be away.
Is there something expecting you?
Boy I hope this date doesn’t drag-on
Meet me out back in twenty minutes. Keep the car running.
I'm already going to prom with Saint George.
You are early,the birthday boy is still napping
I thought for our first date we agreed to meet at the coffee shop?
Pete's not home.
In said appear in DRAG!
It's not a knock-knock joke?
Shhh! The king's home! Meet you at the Hippogriff Inn as soon as I change into my scales.
‘Me sorry about last knight.’
I said maybe come and light my fire..not baby...
Sir George say's he won't let you treat him that way and he never ever wants to see you again!
Of course he doesn’t hate you. He just needs to cool down.
Really, it's not your breath.
Really, it's not you personally . It's your breath.
You can come up to my room, but go tippy-toe so my daddy doesn't hear you.
You didn’t hear this from me, but you might want to try breath mints.
You looked a bit different in your Grinder photo.
So...if I give you a kiss, you'll turn into a prince?
Sorry, no flowers allowed.
Did you bring breath mints?
I think you are looking for sixty-six million BCE.  It's directly behind you.
You can huff and puff all you want but she's not coming out.
Sorry, but I already found a toad and he's a much gentler kisser.
Lose the posies and come back with flame-roasted cauliflower steaks!
I'm not letting my daughter be wooed by a cheapskate dragon who can't at least bring some treasure.
You looked shorter in your Tinder pic.
Quick, behind the dungeon.
Or Father will see us.
She's  out with the dragon  slayer  tonight.
She told me to tell you that she never wants to see you again because you have dragon breath.
Oh my.  I'd hoped you were just a bad trip brought on by my occasional overconsumption of magic mushrooms.
Your photo on "match.com" was very different
I realize you breathe fire, but that doesn't make you smoking hot.
No need to bring flowers. I'm just looking for a Sugar Dragon
New to Tinder. Thought I swiped left.
Do you think anybody saw you?
Sorry, she’s out for the Knight.
"Saint George."  You have a visitor.
I think there's a problem.  We don't get HBO.
Um, just a minute. St. George!!!!!
But Dino your tail’s too big.
Let’s not let this relationship drag on.” 

John Fletcher, Los Angeles, C
Sorry, but you look nothing like your Tinders profile.
We will go out, but only because you are witty. I heard about your roastings
I 'm not coming out tonight, I'm watching Game of Thrones.
St. George will be out in just a minute.  He's, uh, collecting flowers for you too.
This alternate ending for Game of Thrones isn't any better!
Yes, you have dragon breath.
I ordered Dragon's Breath flowers-- not a dragon with flowers!
She said, over her burnt carcass will she date you again.
Where were you during Game Of Thrones?
The series is over.  And she died.
Only if you chew a breath mint first.
I can't keep dating you.  You ate the last three chaperones.
It’s me, not you.
Well, I guess we both used old photos.
I've heard of a Lion King, but never a Dragon Prince.
They want to know if you are a vegan
But I'm allergic to flowers!
On your back, Eliot? Really?? IT’S PROM.
I'm canceling my subscription to HOTDATE.COM! 
It's the 3rd dragon this week
I told you to come around to the back entrance.
My knight is where?
My snoring?  That’s the problem?
Bare the blooms.  The hat will not double as tassel.
Oh dear. Wait, let me get a  vase.
Prince Charming will be down in a minute.
If you don't serve cocktails, i'd sooner take a 747
No tie!? My dad's gonna freak!
You had me at forked tail.
The Princess will be with you as soon as we can zipper up her asbestos gown.
Come around back.  My father has this entrance watched.
Sorry, she's not allowed to date older dragons.
To be honest I was expecting more from your prom-posal.
You looked a lot younger on your profile.
Sorry, Doug...she's no longer a virgin.
You're awfully sweet, but mixed marriages never work.
I told them I liked giant SNAPdragons. Sorry.
Fred, not tonight. I have a headache.
You didn't tell me you ate her father, Gary.
He's still upset that you melted the sealing wax he brought to you.
Left about an hour ago. Said she can start her own fire.
I may have lied a bit on my Tinder profile.
Nice outfit! You don't give up, do you!
I'm happy to see you found work delivering flowers, now that Game of Thrones has ended.
That’s it; I’m filing a restraining order.
I simply can't tonight, I'm out of moisturizer."
They shouldn’t suspect anything. Just don’t breathe out until we get inside.
I do love you... I'm just not ready to subvert this narrative.
You’re a lot more handsome in person than your online profile picture.
Mom says you'd need to convert.
Hang on. I’ll just get my bag.
I just don't think you're her type, dear.
Just so you know, I hated 'Game of Thrones.'
She's in the north tower.
Go away. She doesn't want to see you. She says you're a monster.
Sorry, she told me to tell you she only dates vegans.
Game of Thrones is on, can you comeback later?
You ghosted me, now I roasteth thee.
Your Profile photo looked so different!
Oh my! Usually when guys write 6' 0" it actually means 5' 10"
He’s just getting his armour on, and then he’ll be right out.
You look like a nice dragon; please come in.
Are you here to audition for the Game of Thrones prequel?
That's the last time I kiss a frog!
For the last time, you’re not my type.
You can come in, Sheldon, but no smoking.
The troll brought me a whole bouquet.
The moment the princess realized she swiped wrong on Cinder.
Before Tinder there was Cinder.
You had a lot more hair in your photo.
Hate flowers, love dinosaur jerky
He can't come to the door, right now, because he doesn't have his armor on, ..can I take a message?
You are sweet, and I feel your passion burning, but my Dad is very strict...he doesn't let me fly on school nights.
I knew your Tinder profile picture was too good to be true!
I’m tired of bad boys.
I've been burned too many times in past relationships.
I prefer roses!
I fear that I don't feel the same spark that you do.
It's that last Dragon again from Game of Thrones.  He wants to audition for the prequel.
You big goof, the Series ended and now she is playing a lawyer on some show in the States
Ms. Rowling says she's flattered, but she's already married.
Sorry, but I have a date with Godzilla tonight.
Well, the Queen did say that when she fell in love it would be a romance for the ages.
Snap Dragons? Really? How gauche!
HE'S THREATENING "FIRE AND FURY" AGAIN!!!!
Np, there's no one here named Jackie Paper.
Didn't you see the season finale?
She says it's your breath.
I’m not the have fun and puff type.
Sure,now that the Dargareyn wench dumped your sorry fire breathing self. You come flying back to me ?
Be a sweetie and wait a minute; I can't decide what to wear . . .
We're out back. You brought your suit, right?
You’re not what I had in mind when the Princess was describing you.
She'll be ready as soon as she gets the burn mark out of her asbestos cape
She says she can't forgive you for that fiery speech.
And they say the perfect man is a fictional creature...
Sorry, no one here can help you now. Try another knight?
She says not until you do something about your breath.
Thanks for the date.  Don't breathe a word and I think I can get back to my room safely.
You don’t look like your picture!
You are violating the restraining order.
I don't care if you ARE a handsome prince! I'm still NOT kissing you!!
You were to literal in your expectations of Tinder.
They respect your years of experience,but the producers decided to go with a fresh new face for the sequel. Please don't burn the messenger.
Could you toast them for me?
You don’t look much like your profile pic
I'm sorry, St. George says you really have to stop 'just dropping by to say hello.'
You look taller in the profile picture.
I told you to sneak around the back! My parents think I’m sleeping over at Briar Rose’s place tonight.
One advantage is cutting down on winter heating bills.
You're not what you looked like on the internet", said the dragon
I'm here to discuss diplomacy with your Supreme Leader.
I can't date you, my dad thinks you're a hot head
Do you have protection
Ma'am, I was picking wildflowers, but now my car won't start;  may I please use your phone to call AAA?
He said his burns are healing and will be ready to fight you again next week.
No more auditions! Game of Thrones is over!
Just a dolphin, maam.
Milady says it's not you,it's your breath.
She thinks you're hot too.  But not that kind of hot.
I’m here regarding the personals ad posted on SirCraigslist.
I don't need snapdragon flowers to remember you.
I'd consider it if you did something about your breath.
Is your brother home?
What did you say to her this time?
If you apologize, they will know you left the coffee cup on the set.
Jessica? Sorry, nobody here by that name.
You look nothing like your FaceBook photos.
Shhh. Don't wake Dad.
you looked different in your photo
Flowers are nice, but they don’t change the fact that you’re a dragon, for God’s sake!
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but she eloped with a unicorn two days ago.
Is the Prince here?
Do you like my hat?
Things have certainly changed since St. George took his summer break.
I’ve told you before, she won’t date a smoker!
Papa says not to come a-courting until you get a real job.
If that lasts longer than 4 hours, you should consult your doctor.
You said you would call.
My parents don’t approve of interspecies marriage.
I know you've been burned too many times.
She says she's been burned for the last time! She says you just don't know when to quit!
She needs her beauty rest. 
She'll look picture book perfect in eight hours.
Two common roadside flowers? That is weak! Show some fire!
Not dragon lilies again!
I enjoy you’re company but I think you’re a bit overprotective.
Rapunzel is washing her hair. Come back in a week. And use some mouthwash, brimstone breath.
Hi, Sweetie, She'll be down in a minute.
Those flowers don't make up for what you did to the last castle.
Sorry, I have to wash my cone.
That’s so sweet, but another dragon has promised to kidnap me and put me in distress.
I told you, no date until you do something about that dragon breath.
So you DO look like your profile picture!"
Are you here to install the cable?
Just FYI my dad is super conservative.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
It hasn't even been six months since you were eating my best friend.
No, I asked for snapdragons.
Not now.  My Knight is back from his crusade
Wait, you're not Khaleesi.
Honey, the Amazon's screwed up our order again.They sent us flowers, not flour.
Seriously? 26?
I'm not looking for a fairy tale romance.
Sorry for burning down the rest of your garden.
Oh! You looked much bigger in your Tinder profile picture.
Why not?...West Side Story...that's why not
You can come in, but, first, you'll have to wipe off those feet.
I think the maiden you're fire crooning for is the next castle over.
I still love you, it's just that the optics are really bad right now.
You’re not fooling anybody.
So you're not up for a hot date?
The fans say they aren't ready to see you again after what happened in Season 8.
If you're here, then who's guarding our treasure?
I have to say--the idea of free flights at any time is enticing.
Well, the scorched-earth approach wasn't really working for me.
Enter, the dragon!
The Princess knows you still have feelings for her but since you were cursed by her mother, the witch, she feels she must pursue other options.  She's "Really sorry" and hopes you can remain friends.
Flowers? Try killing something. I like bad boys.
You're not a smoker though, right?
So this is awkward, but have you done anything about your breath?
Last we saw your mom, she was out with her nephew.
Sorry. St George is expected soon
Quickly, before the guards see you.  I told you to always use the back gate.
Lady Godiva , Can Georgie come out to play ?
Sorry- We're democrats here
Okay, I'll go out but only if you don't breathe a word of this to St. George.
Milady fears you have misunderstood the gossip about her thinking you're hot.
Woo doesn't pitch itself.
Would you please fuck off?
I love her---she just slays me.What to do?
I know.  Me, too...
My heart says stay, my tail says go.
I’m sorry but I’m actually your aunt!
She isn’t taking callers today.
You are everything I shouldn’t like. Dating you goes against my own best interests. You will certainly kill me and burn down my entire village. Come on in
The Abominable Snowman brought me roses.
Give me a minute. I have to tell Mama and Papa "Guess who's coming to dinner!"
Mom says I can't.  My gown got all singed last time.
Sorry, visiting eras are over... come back in a few aeons
Thank goodness. My last blind date was an ogre.
Apology not accepted.
She left with King Kong.
Variation on "Game of Thrones" caption submission #8379.
It was in very poor taste to apologize with baby’s breaths.”
Houston, we have a problem.
Go away! You're 65 million years too late.
You’ll find her down the road, second cave on the left.
Come in, but the parents say no fire breathing.
From Game of Who?
Late for dinner?? Again??
Sure, c’mon in and we’ll wait for the sequels together.”
Honestly, you seem lovely, but she's taking a break form monsters right now.
But you can't be my date, you look nothing like your profile portrait.
Very well,I forgive you.  But no more oral sex.
It's the lusty month of May, Gwenviere.
Okay—but ix-nay on the ire-fay, eh?
She’s in bed with finale angst.
Wrong door.
Your photos looked different.
My parents can't wait to finally meet you!
She can't see you, she's washing her scales.
You're too late.  The prince already picked her up.
Father wants to know what your intentions are.
Just put them in the moat with all the rest.
Sorry, we bought flowers from the neighborhood orge last week"
Uh, look, Jeff, could you come back in 15? I gotta clean up. The last dragon left a mess.
If you'd been turned into a frog, maybe. This is going to be a deal-breaker.
Your mom didn't give you the memo?! Trick-or-Treating ended at 7:00 PM!
Too soon, everyone's still mad about King's Landing.
Sorry, but the Princess is in bed recovering from third degree burns.
The Princess has gone out for the Knight.
Maybe if you did something with your breath.
I’m afraid that your mother has already left for Kings Landing!
Puff ?
dragons breath...  my favorite
How cold does it get flying to Vegas?
Sorry, I only accept flowers from frogs.
Sorry-date is off! You said nothing in your profile about a tail!
Sorry honey, your tail is pointing to the right direction
Sorry, but she’s busy binge watching GoT.
Sorry, I have allergies
She will be right out; she has a slight case of bronchiosaurus
Come on in and don't be dragon your feet.
Now we are sure to win the chilli cookoff
Nothing against you personally, but your breath...!"
They're beautiful, but could you come back when my father is not home?
Honey, the Gerrymander is back.
Sorry, but I’m partial to toads.
It might be a good idea if we kept this quiet.
Alas, Cinderella is at a loss for hair and words.
My dad's away, so we can use the king size bed.
I thought you'd be a catfish...
I wouldn't say Sarah's description was *entirely* accurate, no. But she assures me you don't have a podcast?
I'm afraid you have the wrong castle.
Long trip.  Are you draggin?
How much gold?
Be careful, the moat is filled with crocodiles... and my dad is home.
I know it’s cold blooded Puff but the magic is gone.
Oh—you look different on your profile.
Look, you are sweet, but I’ve got the hots for the frumious Bandersnatch.
Listen, you're a nice guy, it's just...your breath.
This can never work. You're an Aries.
-I think she doesn't want to give you wings.
I won't date you until you do something about your breath.
Sorry, but it's your breath.
You certainly are androgynous.
Frog kisses are obviously overrated.
My father has yet to know about us!  Meet me out back in 10 minutes.
Sorry, Al. I cannot take another morning of Dragon-breath."
Maybe take a little time to mourn, eh Drogon?
No, she can't come out, she's grounded!
It's not that I dont like you, it's your breath
Sorry, it doesn't make up for King's Landing.
200 feet! The restraining order says no closer than 200 feet!
My husband hasn't left yet...come back in an hour.
Nice try, Roger!
Ah, yes of course...you’re here for the Tupperware party? Come on in.
No , she would not date a stranger...
Now that GOTs has ended, it is just too painful to see you anymore.
Sorry, but the last time we let in a flower bearing dragon it ate all our pigs, half the,sheep, and the mayor.
It's not you. I'm just not comfortable with the title "Girlfriend of Dragons."
Do you have an invitation?
How do we know you aren't a Trojan horse?
She just left with your brother.
No. She lives two castles down.
I think the "fire" has gone out of our relationship.
I told you,  my father doesn't believe in inter-species dating.
Stop dragon ass, and get in here!
It's just for one night.
You look a bit different from your profile picture.
Just a minute: she's blow-drying her hair.
I'm washing my hair tonight.
My folks are a little weird about me dating...
i told you not to come while my husbant is home!
Auditions for How to Train Your Dragon 4 are two castles down.
You sure don’t match your dating profile photo!
Are we going to be flying? Should I grab a jacket?
Come in, but be quiet! My dad fell asleep watching a documentary about you.
You'll have to meet my father, first.
Your tinder profile makes you seem...….smaller.
Yes, Jackie Paper's castle is 2 doors down.
Damn auto-correct got me again. I was searching for a date with a drag queen, not a drag-on. Sorry.
You can come in if you let me take your breath away.
He hoped to win her love with a posy and a tall tail.
Hold on, I want you to meet my father, St. George.
Well, that’s an original approach for a dragon.
You'll have to come back later she just finished molting.
You a knight late and a doubloon short.
Alas, you’ve got dragon’s breath.
It's pronounced BOOT EDGE EDGE.
Come back in an hour, my dad’s still home.
Up for a little barbecue?
Sorry, I know the wrap party is for the entire cast, but she said absolutely not.
Quick, my father just left to slay you.
Tell the Princess her bouquet didn't make it through the  high altitude.
You really burned me.
We can’t, I’m your mother.
Change is good.
It's just that my old boyfriend George is the jealous type.
I ordered snap dragons, not a dragon who snaps.
My father, the King, would never approve.  Let's roll.
Let’s meet on the roof.
Great disguise Sir Lancelot, but I think this will create more problems than it solves.
She says, “Not tonight. [she’s] washing her scales.”
Hi honey, I'm home
Will they know I'm an immigrant?
But I had my heart set on snapdragons.
Flower bearing is an improvement, yes, but you're still fire breathing.
Two flowers for our ten year anniversary? At least your tail is pointing you in the right direction.
OMG, where’s that dragon-slayer when I need him?
I’m sorry, Smokey. I’m on ‘The Patch’ now.
Sorry. You aren’t in the prequel.
No I am not in distress. That is how I always sound whilst on the commode.
It’s 5:00... When the notice says, “BBQ at 3 PM” you’re expected to be here at 2... oh yeah, and thanks for the 2 friggin’ flowers.
My father says I can't go out with you 
because you're mythical!
You want the Georges. Last castle on the right.
My wicked stepsister created that Tinder profile.
Oh my, that was some filter you used on your profile pic!
I should have known you'd be dragon yourself back here!
Your Airbnd reviews are rather iffy.
Sorry Andy, I only date orthodox Hydras.
You look nothing like your picture on Medieval Matchmaker... Are those flowers for me?
I can’t go out tonight. I’m still getting over third degree burns from our last date.
Sorry, but Her Highness is not acquainted with anyone from the Amazon.
Ooh..Uber has gone fancy...
The princess says to tell you she's busy but the prince says he'll be right down.
It’s not so much a problem with you. It’s my parents. My dad says he got burned by your dad once.
You looked taller in your profile pic.
That's so sweet, but I'm already dating King Kong.
She said she's washing her hair. Can you come back tomorrow?
..yes, the king is still asleep... did you bring a condom?
I liked you better as a frog.
Meet me at the backdoor so no one will see you.
Now that GOT has ended I wanted to say it wasn’t just tv.
I'm sorry to make you fly all the way here; Matthew and I decided to get back together.
Guinevere was nervous, she’d been burnt before!
You're fired.
I'm sorry, did you say your name is Puff?
It's over, Gary. Your breath may have been the fortress' undoing, but your fear of intimacy will be yours.
Please, not another Game of Thrones reference...
Antioch? You want Asia Minor, not Europe.
Are you sure you have the right address?
You're late again, Griffin.  Why do you keep taking me for a dunce?
Look, she has to be back by dinner or her dad will be dragging the moat looking for her.
Sorry we are scaling back
Remember your quiet voice if someone brings up the iron throne.
Shhh. I told you to sneak around back...
I’m computer generated...or have you heard that line before?
I specifically told you the party is costumes only....
I can see your, uh, thing.
I'm not falling for that old trick.
Tell that errant son of mine that Mother's Day was last week.
So... I heard there's this interesting French film at the Anjelika and I was wondering....
I think she'd be more willing if you brought her a couple of cows.
Where were you last Winter when I needed you?
Can you get over the wall? This door is too  small.
I'm sorry Puff, although you're a very handsome dragon, it's your breathe.
It's frogs.  I have to kiss a lot of frogs.
Yesterday a frog, today a dragon, what's it doing to be tomorrow?
Did you remember the breath mints?
It's Gay Pride Week. These are for St. George.
I'm Sorry Neville but I think we need to start seeing other people.
Dragons and fair maidens, yeah... that's only in fairy tales. Sorry.
I'm taking a different approach here,
She actually goes by "Reusable Tote Bag Princess" now.
She hasn't quite gotten over your last fire-breathing stunt. Give it some time.
I'm very flattered, but I'm already taken.
Be sneaky, my father still doesn't know you exist.
I think my father's on to us.  They found scales in the bedding.
But I thought our chemistry was good!
No, Mr.  Fafnir, if that is even your real name,  a few flowers is not enough to get St. George to come out and play.
Pardon my shock, but you're not what I expected based on your profile etching.
We have damsels in distress, but none of them are virgins!
Knock, Knock.
I brought these for you in apology.  I ate your big sister.
You don't want this -- it would not end well.
Sorry, I'm just a figurative dragon lady.
'It's just for lunch.' Yeah, well, thanks, but I'm not really into to 'flame broiled.'
Thanks all the same, but I just kissed the frog.
Is this some game you're playing for my throne?
Sorry, you're just not the same old flame I remember.
Rapunzel said she’ll be with you as soon as she’s done with her hair.
Khaleesi doesn’t live here anymore.
Who do you take me for, the village idiot?
Your profile did say you’re looking for a hot date.
Don’t let my father see you!
She doesn't love you. She's a tower made of stone. You stuck your tail up her ONCE.
You're too early. Don't you know she's a night person?
George, come hither!
I told you I did not want this affair to drag on ...
I may be your type, but hideous monsters are not MY type.
I know I get heated sometimes, but I really think we can make this work.
It's Beowulf. Why do you ask?
Not now! The prince came over!
Look, I'm not giving you 5 stars for the ride when half of your passengers fell off.
You better beat it, I called George.
The Princess wants to know if you will turn into a very tall prince if she kisses you.
The princess says she's not interested. Further, she requests that you follow your tail and kindly get the hell out of here.
But can you light a fire?
Wait, so that’s not a dick?
Oh sure. NOW you come around after the casting calls have stopped.
Sorry; I'm allergic to pollen.
You said you were a frog on Tinder.
I prithee forgiveness. It’s not you.
If you see me with my parents, pretend we just met.
You just slay me! I'll be right out!
These are from the knight over there.
I know, I know - #notalldragons.
Idiot! I asked you to bring me a cup of flour.
It’s not you, it’s me and my fear of flying.
Your picture looked less threatening.
Hey BIG HOT ! Rapunzel's not here  I'm Belle, her hairdresser.
How bout I let down my Locks
Sorry Rex, she's out with St. George tonight.
Hark ! Are you my prince in drag coming to kiss me?
#NotAllDragons
Oh...You again”
You can come in, but be quiet. Mom and Dad are asleep upstairs.
I thought you said you were a Dra-goon!
Don’t worry. I told them you were JUST like the Frog Prince.
Donkey doesn't want to see you right now.
I'm sorry, I just dont feel the fire inside anymore
I can’t go out with YOU tonight. I’ve been grounded.
Are those from my garden?
You are no longer needed.  We bought a propane heater.
I can’t let this relationship drag-on any longer.
You don't match your online profile at all.
Sorry, you’re just not my phenotype.
You seemed taller in your pictures online.
Come back later, my wife's home
Sorry, the prequel's been cast.
I need a little more 'fiery' and a little less 'flowery'.
Do you have a friend for my sister?
Just give us a Flyover!
OK, I’ll go out with you but you gotta promise not to smoke.
No, Julian's out with Mr. Prince Charming from across the way.
I'm having second thoughts.
I'm sorry, but I can't let this drag-on any longer.
Your profile said you’d be taller.
Saint George says, "Go away, if you know what's good for you."
For starters,you might try a cooling  breath mint.
Can't ya understand  flower girl?  You're a cute and  incredible survivor, but time is on my side.
George said to tell you again, he's not gay.  Would it kill you to stop trying to date him?
That #MeToo status was about me, right?"
As I told you last week, men are required to wear a jacket.
No, no, no....no air kisses!
Daenerys isn’t in right now.
Sorry about your prince
I know the princess is expecting a knight but wouldn’t she rather see the victor?
By any chance , have you seen a knight in shinning armmor?
My parents don’t approve of mixed-species relationships.
Are you crazy?! My dad’s going to kill you!
I guess this is what you get if you don't look at the profile picture on dating websites.
Sorry. Rapunzel says she is washing her hair this week.
It’s just a tattoo.
Ok, but just one drink for old times' sake.
Can you come back next week? 
We’re still working on Contest #667!
You're cute, but we have to do something about your breath.
I'm sorry but we have to end this... I'm allergic to Daisies!
Dad wants to discuss your family.
She’s up in the tower letting down her golden hair.
Would it kill you to visit some other time besides Mother's Day?
My husband is getting suspicious - last night he smelled brimstone on my breath.
No sorry, the knight in my dating profile picture is my good friend."
Sorry.  I’m not remoatly interested.
She'll be out in a second. Would you care for some goat while you wait?
I’ve got to hand it to you. Burning  down that village was a pretty impressive promposal.
Are you my mother?
my dad wants to meet you. 
just to warn you, he’s mad you did that yell/roar thing & didn’t come up to the door to knock.
Come On Baby Light My Fire.”
-The Door
Verily, dragonne, thou art so thirstie....and I am so boréd...come hither, crosse mine moate and perchance I wilst giveth you a pittie fucke
I’ve told you before, Lance. If you want to date Deirdre, get circumcised.
I wanted to apologize about the prince.
I love you too but we can't ignore what our children would face.
Your uber is arriving now. Your driver will wait two minutes before leaving. Enjoy the ride!
Look, all i’m saying is you should consider the possibility that he’s just not that into you...
You think you can make it up to me with flowers?!  You burned down the village!
Well how was I supposed to know you two are roommates!?
You don’t look like a frog...
please accept my plea, I was feeling the burn
...trying to light a fire under you
C’mon—we agreed to keep this casual.
Alfred, how long is this going to drag on?
I know you've been hurt before, but I'm not like other dragons.
So...will there be cake at this party.
I can't come out and play right now, but I'll meet you in the Dungeon after dark.
Shh, the beauty is sleeping and cannot be disturbed for one hundred years!
Go around the back so no one sees you!
What lovely flowers
You don't look anything like your photo on the website...
Shhh.... My husband is home.
I'm sorry but I must have been on the wrong dating site last night; too much mead and not enough self worth!
I realize that the ad said "looking for a tall stranger with a fiery personality to sweep me off my feet" but the Princess hates tails.
Thank you!  That's very nice, but what have you done with Sir Lancelot?
It'll be OK.  Just act nirmal.
You can come back inside, I don’t think the role-swapping is going to work out. One of the servants laughed at his fake wings and now he won’t come down from the tower.
'No it's not Dragons' Den and no I'm not in.'
I wanted diamonds, not flowers, you numbskull!
Either you take an antihistamine or you put down the flowers.
I'm sorry.  Mother of Dragons is out pillaging right now.
Let me ask the king if I’m allowed to ride on your back.
No.  St. George passed years ago.
Shouldn't you be guarding my sister?
Sorry,  you have the wrong kingdom.
I’m so sorry! I swiped right by accident.
I know you've got a big heart but that's the problem.
Not now. I’m in seclusion, mourning the end of Game of Thrones.
Sorry, we’re the Dunyeons, with a y.
I said, "I only date frogs."
...it's Next Tuesday?...
Just give me the flowers before you set them on fire!
Two lousy petunias ...And to think you used to breath fire for me .
To be perfectly frank, m’lady was seeking a lover for whom she would burn, not one who might burn her.
Only frogs turn into princes.
Are those poppies?
You're sweet, but let's just meet at the cookout.
Aren't you quite a few millenia behind the times?
Do you realize that my dad is St. George?
Seriously!? I thought I already made it clear to you that I never date smokers.
It's pride day.
Just so you know, you weren't my first choice.
Condolences and flowers won't bring him back to life!
My dad will slay you if those are from his garden.
I mean it, it’s over.
You didn’t like the ending either?
It’s just 1-800-FLOWERS.
Normally I would be honored to be your date to the sacrifice.  However at the risk of disappointing you, my virginity was lost long ago.  Perhaps you'll have better luck at the next castle.
Qick, hide me please... my mother doesn't believe in mixed marriages!
She says you’ve lost your fire
You know I have allergies!
Do you want a kiss?
Chocolates my love, lest thou let forth thy most fateful sneeze.
No, he's been burned before.
So now that GOT is over, you want back in! Ain't happening.
He’s asking for Guinevere
I don't want to  see you any more, no point in dragon it on any longer."
Not now! Come back when he's off crusading.
Yes, a second date, but without that sword-happy chaperone fella.
I heard you when you knocked the first time.
You think flowers gonna compensate for what you did to my people?
Come back when the King is out hunting dragons
Sorry about the overdone marshmallows
You brought flowers? I expected chocolate! Dark chocolate!!
Go around back and hide in my she-shed.
I don't care if I remind you of your mother, We're too different
I come in peace. Trust me , you do not want to make me angry"
Sorry, deliveries are at the back drawbridge.
A well-formed strapping lad, sir, and quite quaint in his manners.
Later, Dexter.  Dad's still pretty hot.
Not you, honey.  Your dog.
Are you here for "drag & queen" reading hour
Sorry,we're committed to HBO.
Please Mr. Trump, how can I trust you?
I know you're not ready, but the writers really want to wrap up and get to the finale.
DONAAAAALD, YOUR DATE IS HERE.
Leave the flowers with casting...we’ll call you if there’s a prequel.
No, it's not YOU.....it's ME!
The king is home, come back later!
Sorry, dad says I have to be 16 before we can date.
Sorry, our dragon is grounded for fire breathing in bed.
Well this explains the burn marks in his under armor
Well, I'd like to eat out. Last time you cooked the kitchen burned down.
It's not a good Knight.
Didn't you see the tie on the doorknob.
She has a visitor.
Psssst, can we discuss your job performance lately?
Sorry, she is out laying waste to Casterly Rock
Sorry, you've been de-moated.
Just a hunk of burnin' love for you, babe!
Have you come to slay the Prince?
Not another virgin, please. I just want to talk.
Second castle on the left, just past the catapult.
Will you be my Dinner?
Excuse me, Sir - This is a Ye Olde White Castle. Please drive thru to the side window to pick up your burger order.
I don't want flowers, I want the Iron Throne!
I can't leave in a den, you can't dwell in a castle; it is one moat that we cannot bridge.
You can't go like that -- it's a black tie affair
I need to know what pronoun you prefer-he, she or they?
Look, she's still pretty burned up over your last date, so cool it, OK?
Look, you're very nice, and strong, but my family doesn't want me dating dragons after what happened with Daenerys.
Are those real dragon lillies?
Make it quick. I'm watching Game of Thrones.
She’ll be right out. Just getting the marshmallows.
Oh my...HBO or PBS?
You should've apologized last knight.
You’re gonna have to sneak in through the window.
She said to tell you "you slay me."
This will never work. I’m a Cancer and we’re just not compatible with fire signs.
I understand xhe told you xhe was identifying as a dragon... but xhe is identifying as an orc today
She’s at the chapel, marrying the beast.
Sorry, but your password needs to have at least one numeral and one capital letter.
This is not the "Fantasy Date" I had in mind.
First recorded case of "Stockholm Syndrome", circa 5th century
I was hoping for someone with fire in his belly.
Saint George said that he will not accept your apology.
Welcome dragon calling!
What are you doing here? I swiped you to the left.
No, sorry, I can’t. It’s your breath.
That's NOT a FROG!
Uh, I'm here for Cerberus.
Can you do your magic tonight, P?
Sorry, she’s doing her hair.
She’s almost ready, but her breath spray keeps igniting!
Wow. And I thought that flower deliveries by Uber and Lyft were ridiculous.
FYI- most suitors bring at least a dozen roses
I don't think things could ever work out for us - you're a Capricorn.
You were supposed to bring creme brulee!
What's the secrete password?
I can't tonight.  Father's being a real beast.
Sorry, I only date frogs.
Uhhh sorry,  wrong castle. My GPS is “tailing” it’s that way.....
Fairy tales can come true it can happen to you...
Just between you and me, the Princess has already kissed A LOT of frogs!
Danny is still upset about how you interfere in her relationships.
I know you hoard gold, yet you brought flowers?
My last suitor was a big, bad, wolf.  He said "I'll blow your house down".  Can give me a better offer?
Sorry, I have to wash my snood.
No more auditions. Game of Thrones season ended.
She's not interested dragon breath.
You know you razed the village yesterday.  What makes you think it is a good day to meet my parents?
Sorry, the show's over...Bran is king.
This isn’t going to work out, last time you kissed me you burned my tongue!
It'll take a lot more than that to make up for that stunt with the candles last night.
Not tonight dear, I've got a flaming headache.
It's still not enough for a threesome.
Your profile said you were a wyvern...
I think you misunderstood what I meant when I said my love burns for you.
You call that a promposal?
She’s already seeing someone with dragon energy.
Sorry honey, I canceled HBO.
The story just wouldn't work if we tried anything out.
I think you're looking for Westeros.
Just leave the flowers and go follow your tail.
Sorry. Wrong house.
Me thinks   the  princess requested  a   gargle  not   a   gargoyle.
...and  I  love  you, but  I  also loved my brother until you  got drunk and then you got jealous.
I thought we were meeting at the restaurant...
Sorry, Mother says it's your breath.
You must stop dragon my heart around.
She said she only wants chivalry from knights, sorry.
She told me to tell you she prefers truffles. Or livestock.
I'm sorry, she says that you're a little too hot-headed for her
You looked younger on Tinder
Sorry, Puff, she's gone cold turkey.
You need more fire in your courtship.
I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong castle.
Not quite what I meant by 'come to court'.
Don't you come "dragon" in here with just two measly flowers!!
Marvin, please, I told you never to meet me here.
Come through the back door, so I can get some tail!
Sorry, you'll be wanting the Dragon's Keep next door.
It's sweet of you to come by Puff, but Jackie became engaged last week.
To be honest, I've been burned by dragons too many times before.
Ooh, I think that strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy!
Are you alone ?
Marcel? Is that you? Oh Marcel, I thought you were shot down by the Luftwaffe over Maastricht! Oh Marcel, I've remarried to a Minotaur from Crete. He's not much to look at, but he knows the complicated irregular network of passages to my heart.
Not now.  I’m binging the entire series of Game of Thrones.
I must admit I do prefer this approach.
Friends?
There's no Daenerys here
Do you have time for a brief survey? 
Free gift included.
I promise you will get used to it in no time!
She said: "Only if you can breathe fire!"
Lets make it quick, I sent him to your lair
Look, can we just start over?
Look... I brought you flowers!  Please turn me back into a man!
Come back after midnight, my husband's not asleep yet.
Is this a bad time?
So now that Game of Thrones is finished you think I’m going to take you back?
If you plan on staying over, you’ll need breathe mints.
We can't Drag On this relationship when we both know it's over.
I’m sorry she can’t come out today. She’s got a sore throat from your fiery kisses last night!
I am here to pay my respects to the expectations of Game of Throne's fans.
Tell the prince to send a more discrete animal next time...
This will not change George's mind.
I'll catch holy hell if I'm seen with you.
She ran off with King George.
For the June 24th issue (I know I'm too late):
Thank goodness for Ikea's picture instructions.  I have no idea how to read.
How was the flight? You look famished!
You're not what I had in mind when I wished for a hot date.
But soft! What knight through yonder window breaks?
I'm sorry, she is out with the swamp creature.
I just don't think I'm in a place emotionally to be captured right now.
Flowers don’t make up for you burning the village
Not until you do something about that dragon's breath.
No solicitations!
Now hurry, before my husband finds out.
It's just... You looked different in your Tinder profile.
A word to the wise. The princess likes flowers but you'll need breath mints as well.
What took you so long? For three days we've gone without fire.
You’ll have to hold your fire
You're going to have to do much better than those measly flowers if you're going to woo my lady
Puff, you’re just not real to me!
Hmm, you looked shorter on your profile picture.
That is very sweet, but you do know I am gay?
Sorry, this relationship is hopeless; I have hayfever and there is no way you can  fit through this gate,
Can we go out to eat tonight? I 'm getting tired of eating everything well-done.
Sure, just a minute, let me see if he's home.
No. She's still angry about the fire.
You looked shorter in your picture
Let me find a vase.
Flowers or no flowers you can't come in.  Last time you were here you sneezed and nearly burned down the entire castle!
Sorry. Prince Charles or not. I'm still not kissing you.
I’m interested but you didn’t respond to my question about bondage.
Sorry,but your profile didn't say you had a tail."
No no no. You're looking for Westeros. This is Trumperos.
I’m sorry  you can’t come in I’m allergic to the flowers
My Knight in shinny armor is passed out,  so it's you and me tonight, you handsome devil!
This isn’t what I had in mind from your dating site profile.
Too late to apologize... you melted my Dad's favorite chair!
Come back with Bar-B-Q.
Harold, I love you, but my dad won’t think the claim “It’s 2019” will cut it...
She's watching Game of Thrones.
It's going to take a lot more than flowers to get back in this castle, mister.
‘Sorry, but you’re 65 million years  too late!’
'It's nothing personal Drogon, but your breath could kill.
When a woman says no, she means NO.
I don't care how many bouquets you bring me, I can't lend you the script because the show has been cancelled." 
 John Day, Kent, WA
oh, the prince and i have been married for 20 years
Madam, your ride has arrived.
I would have preferred you brought me a fire blanket.
Use the back gate silly, I don't want anyone to see us.
She'll be down in a flash...she's just getting into her heat retardant dress."
She would know me as @Albert.
Come in through the kitchen, my parents are in the living room!
I know you've been singeing other girls.
Sorry to tell you this, but St George has slain your dragon lady.
No, I don't care that you grilled the dinner yourself.
Apology accepted, but no more s’mores incidents please.
The land shark was trickier!
Really? Two weeds don't make up for scorching my garden.
No, no. It's Prince Charming I'm awaiting ... not Prince Charring.
I told you before, we have no future until you do something about your breath.
Flowers matter.
Sorry, I’m still a little burned out from our last date.
Wait, you're @princecharming1697?
I'm sorry, but the Princess has been burned kissing dragons.  She's sticking with frogs.
She's almost ready.  Just putting on her fire proof sweater.
No princess ever gave me flowers before. . . .
I know, my breath isn't so hot either.
I told you not to come over if my brother George is home!
Flowers won't do, we just weren't made for each other.
Come in quickly before my father sees you
Our gargoyle is out right now. You'll have to come back later.
If you blow your nose, you can come in.
Can you come back later? My husband is home and I don't want him to accidentally behead you.
Excuse me,I'm not a virgin.
Not tonight hot lips.  I've  got q headache
Sorry, no admittance without a tie.
Oh Aaron, my father would never allow it. We’re devout Catholics and I can clearly see you’re Jewish.
Sorry to end it. But I can't let things drag on.
I hope my father didn't see you.
Stop dragon my heart around.
She said she’ll be down with her tenderloins once you reach 350°.
Oh, Big Boy, you light my fire.
That magical kiss not working out?
Oh, I was expecting an uber wagon.
I'm sorry, but the picture on your account was definitely an iguana ...
Ah, yes.  The Ayatollah is expecting you.
Very sweet of you Donald, but, alas, I have a flower allergy. Sorry.
No No, this is medieval anthropocene.  The late Cretaceous prom is two miles down on your right.
She hooked up with the dragon from Game of Thrones
I'm just not afraid of you like that.
That's funny, you don't look like a knight!
Sorry,  I was expecting a hot blind date, not a fire breathing one.
The size of your dowry is more than generous. What concerns me is the size of...
Shhh! Sneak in the window so my father doesn't see you.
She can’t see you because your fire breathing system poses an environmental hazard and doesn’t comply with current safety regulations.’
Maybe we should meet at your place...
Dinner's ready in five.
We're out of starter fluid. Before we go, can you help my dad light the grill
We're not right for each other!  Please don't let this Drag-0n!
Eldadrya, your date is here!
Would you quit frolicking in the autumn mist and get IN here?! 
Winter is coming!”
Come on baby let me light your fire
Stop already with the Jim Morrison bit!
Zipper's stuck on her Prom dress.  She'll be right out.
You had better go. George is coming home any minute.
Done anything about your breath?  Last time it set the door on fire!
No thank you.
We already have a monster.
I'm afraid the King and Queen won't allow me to date outside my own species.
You rang?
Not tonight. You reek of roasted villager.
She doesn’t want to see you. Do you think a lousy bouquet will make things alright? Her parents lived in Tokyo for God’s sake!
No, you're looking for my sister. I'm more into kissing frogs.
Ready for another knight on the town?
Thy love hast singed thee thrice.
Be gone, foul beast!
What are your intentions with my dragon?
Daddy says winter is NOT coming.
We’ll  have to meet elsewhere, can’t let you in. Something about fire regulations.
I'm sorry Un, Donny is at Vlad's for a sleep over.
Jesus Rodney I told you one, wait until he rides out on his quest and two, come to the back gate.
Daddy won't let me elope. He says you're a dragon.
Could you text first?
Fifty years on, Stonewall barriers continue to fall.
Wrong castle; you must be looking for the damsel down the block.
You know, with 'Game of Thrones' over, and all, the magic is kind of over. Sorry.
George, dear! Your ex wife's at the door
Go away, I keep telling you, stop thinking of me as your old flame!
I'm sorry, no exceptions.  All deliveries must be made at the service entrance.
Meet me around back. Under cover of darkness. And bring some barbecue.
She's fictional, not real.  She doesn't exist.
I'm sorry. It's over.You're dragon me down.
Sorry, Jackie, she left with Puff.
Oh, milady, did you order a snapdragon?
Rapunzel’s going to be late - she’s getting a blowout.
I am the Magic Dragon!
Try not to be so conspicuous.
Should I bring the fire extinguisher?
And suddenly he realized, she liked him back.
I have an FTD Birthday delivery for Griselda
Girlfriend, he won't give you the ring, either.
Sorry. We have never heard of DragonMatch.com
You told your dad I was coming for dinner, right?
For the last time, Drogon: The show is over. I'm not really your mother. Go home.
My profile said seeking romance, strength and adventure.  I think I need to refine my search.
Is Elizabeth home?
You're as good as dead if Beowulf finds out you're here.
Get in here quick the King is watching Game of Thrones.
Yes, that's the way to the right castle.
I liked the flames.
I’m sorry the last season was horrible, but you can’t live here
Honestly? It's your breath...
I think I misunderstood the assignment.
It will never work.  I'm allergic to flowers.
Sweet of you to think of me. 
But death is one of my allergies.
I told the king and he said he’ll go out with you but only if you suck his dick
Flowers won't make up for catfishing me, "Greg!!!"
Look, the princess read your OKCupid profile and she's really not into you.
Posies for the little lady!
No, no, no.... follow your tail.
You have a beautiful, sensitive soul, but I’m royalty, and you’re ... you’re a commoner.
I am so  sorry for your loss.
Sorry, Puff died years ago
If it makes you feel any better, he did say you had a nice personality
Are you sure you have the right lair?
Thought I'd take the 'kill 'em with kindness' approach for once.
Matilda will be down as soon as she's done incinerating her previous date.
I'm not in the mood for barbecue tonight.
I'm going with her for emotional support.
Which way to the Dragonfest?
It's case sensitive, remember?
Pae-historic or medieval?
Sorry, I don't have HBO.
That's very sweet. How are you at terrorizing peons with the threat of fiery destruction?
I already told you she doesn't live here anymore.
Hi Mrs. Anderson, is Diane ready?
Stevie says to stop draggin' her heart around.
Sorry...There's a 3-flower minimum for entry!
For heaven's sake, it was just a TV show.
You’re not Shrek!
I’d love to invite you in but we just redid our roof”
and tbe password is
Are you here for the fireplace supervisors job interview?
We’re just too similar.
The flowers are lovely. What are they called?
She won’t come out.  She says you have dragon breath.
Dragon: “Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence something...”
Princess: Wait. Where’s Shrek? Where’s Donkey?
Dragon: Who?
Princess: Are you reciting Rainer Maria Rilke?! No. No. No. This is all wrong!
Oh honey there's a Crackenbruce at the door for you.
I’m sorry, you’ll have to wait for her out here. We haven’t finished fire-proofing the sitting room furniture.
Could you come back later after we've renovated the tower?
Death is not the end.
These flowers might convince her -- at least they'll fit through that door.
George? (burp)  Oh, he said he'd be here by Tuesday.
Oh, don't you dare try to sugarcoat things now!
Arthur said he would send merlin and instead he sends you!
The web-page just says 'big Game of Thrones fan, non-smoker, GSOH'
Too late to appologize!
We aren’t dragon this out any longer: it’s over between us, Smaug.
Um, you don’t look like your profile picture, Mother of Dragons 69
Quietly. My parents are antidragonetic.
Your wings looked bigger on your profile.
She's not due back from Hogwarts for another two weeks - but I can't guarantee as what.
Come in but no smoking.
Could you breathe on my creme brulee ?
I said portfolio, not flowers.
In July? - I don't think so.
We no longer can see one another....father forbids me riding a dragon.
Oh dear,  I can't cope with you.  I clearly said to send a dragoon, a DRAGOON.
No, I'm not a dragon. I'm the Western Union delivery boy.
Is it my breath?
One moment.; I'll get her. She's in the dungeon.
Just say we met on a crusade
The Beauty and the Beast story has already been written.
Daenerys is out winning a war, but I's sure she'd like to see you when she gets back.
You think we've forgotten Season 8 already?
Your heart's in the right place, but it's about your breath.
Sorry Wrong Moat.  My GPS is now pointing in the opposite direction!
That's very kind of you, but you know chivalry is dead.
Remember, you only have three tries.
Stay out of my garden! Scat! Shoo!
You're mistaken if you think you can get away with that hold-your-breath trickery.  Nobody in this castle is that stupid.
I know fake news when I see it!
No, I can’t...I have a date with a stegosaurus tonight.
I thought you were supposed to be a frog?
Saint George says he doesn’t want to see you
Just wait around back-dad’s almost asleep!
I'm terribly sorry, but I've already kissed the frog.
You should have added a banana for scale to your Tinder profile.
We're not a heart attack family; we're a cancer family.
She found someone else to light her fire.
He says his name is Daryl, but he prefers to be called "The Captain."
You melted the Throne. It's over. Go home.
I’m head over tails for you!
Look, you know my father doesn't like green people.
I could never love a dragon who brings me only two flowers.
That's sweet, but where's the fire?
Go around to the turret out back, but I warn you: I am just out of the bath and my hair is a little slippery.
I would but I canceled my fire insurance.
Thanks, but everything is still on fire.
My Google maps isn't working. Which way to the Bronx Zoo?
Aren’t you looking dragonaire.
The real reason St. George killed the dragon.
Just walk through briskly, and don't make any eye contact in the keep.
FTD means Flowers Transmitted by Dragons?
Princess to her husband: "Don't worry honey...it's only a dragon not Trump."
It's fake news, I'm trapped.
Sorry, but you're more like a brother from a very different father and mother.
It was CGI I swear
Nigel, I texted, "flowers and Moët" - Moët. Why would I need another water-based defence mechanism?
Let's not make this drag on.
YOU! Don’t send me flowers anymore!
Amazon? Really?
What, no candy?
I think the donkey ghosted you.
Meet me in the back so we can be on the down-low.
Not until you slay that knight.
She's washing her hair.
Are those medicinal, aromatic, or pollinator-friendly?
Baby, why you do me like this?
Hey, asshole, how many times do I have to tell you?  Jon Snow isn't here.
I'm allergic
Your profile said you were 5' 8"
The password is -I'm not prince charming, I'm a dragon with flowers, no deal on Zuckerberg Crypto Currency.
I'll give St. George the flowers, but I think he's still a little angry about the near-burning-to-a-crisp. 
--Hamish Crawford
Stop right there! Don't bring those into our home! You know I'm allergic!
Your queen isn't ready yet.
But we both swiped right
I get fire or flower?  Get lost."
I only date dragons who have Baby's Breath.
Our date is tomorrow, not today!
She said to tell you she's sorry but something just came up ...
I know you ate the Prince, but it wasn't winner take all.
If I let you in, promise you won't burn the whole place down?
Which is it - did he bail or did you eat him?
I'm afraid there's been a mix-up. Her majesty wishes to partake in chasing the dragon.
You gonna blow me out again.
Pfff, please, this costume is so last season!
Sorry, but I don’t think you were a Veteran.
Sorry to bother you again damsel but I just want to hiss and make up
You'd better scram - George will be back any minute!
Better make it tomorrow, darling.Father is having one of his interspecies rants.
Not today?
My sincere apologies regarding your fleet
Do you breathe fire?  I can't light my birthday candles.
Where's the fire?
I'm sorry, Xorphezk the Terrible. The hoarding habit was just too much.
She is not here sweetie.
She's walking around the neighborhood to help people get their barbecue set going.
I think I'm losing interest in email.
Go away, the king said he'll slay you if he sees us talking again.
No, I am not your mother.
Sorry, I'm over my Game of Thrones period.
Since the series finale, Daddy doesn't want you coming around any more.
I just watched the Game of Thrones finale.  Unless there is a reshoot, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I know you've tried to give up smoking, but until you do, it's just not enough.
If my father finds out, he'll slay you and lock me in the tower forever.
We’re not falling for pleasantries again.
I’m sorry Alfred, but Puff just has that certain something.
She just went out for a mani-pedi.
I'm willing to kiss you but how long will it take you to become a Prince again?
No, Cecil, for me the fire has gone out.
You want to WHAT?  To  WHOM?"
Two flowers won’t neutralize your 
disgusting dragon breath !!!
Princess??  You're still..dressed!  Did I misread the party invite, or am I just too early?
I surrender!
I'll have to watch How to Train Your Dragon.
Where's the box of chocolates?
I burn for you, Princess.
No ... no, you’re looking for the “Breaker of Chains.”  This is Hamlet’s palace. I’m the Breaker of Danes.”
Mother of Dragons: the Prequel
Is your husband home?
But I have a really good benefits package.
They're lovely, but I can't be seen with you. Really.
Not NOW you clod! I'm watching Game of Thrones!
It’s just that you looked taller in your profile picture.”
My parents said you can't go on vacation with us.
U do not bring me flowers,U do not sing me love songs, U hardly talk to me anymore, when I come to the door at the end of the day.
Oh, er, she's gone out with George.
She's finishing season three, then she''ll be out.
I can take a hint.
Happily ever after?  Are you for real?
As I recall that only works for horses
I've tried calling, it always goes straight to voicemail.
No, I won’t “fly with” you.
She's just finishing her make-up, ten minutes tops.
Hey Babe, I just gotta grab my purse.  I'll be right out.
Frank, I don't care if we did meet on Tinder, you've got to do something about your breath, I've only got one wall left!
I’m use to guys lying about their age but this, REALLY?!
Um..... Linda lives next door
Don’t judge a dragon by its tail
Fine, but you go out there and tell him no.
Try to "blend" ! The princess's masquerade ball is about to start.
Sorry...the flight's cancelled...and so is that other good stuff.
But Rapunzel you said that you loved me.
Sorry, but Jackie Paper's been grounded.
I'm sorry, but the invitation said "drag"  party, not "dragon" party.
I"m sorry ! I'm involved with another dragon.Perhaps you know her?
I’m sorry, she didn’t mention a Drogo.
Just so you know, this is a non-fire-breathing castle.
I'm sorry, I only date fire breathing dragons
Mouthwash will put the fire out.
I know this probably isn't what you expected, but I was just wondering if you're free this fortnight
She said flowers won’t make up for almost burning the whole castle down
Didn’t you read my profile?  I’m not down for hook-ups.
Your Facebook photo doesn’t do you justice.
My parents are still home!!
Her father's an anti-dragonite. Any chance that you can get spelled to be a human?
Go home, I only rescued you because my dad runs the local PETA
Damn! My eyes just aren’t Where they used to be.
You must be looking for my father. He's just as full of hot air as you.
Mademoiselle, I have arrived for our fabulous afternoon!
Are those flowers gluten free?
Are you kidding?  Did you see the last episode of Game of Thrones?
... but your burning desire was the problem, George."
Don’t be scared, I’m a lover, not a fighter.
Thank god. I would never date anyone shorter than myself.
Our plumber is in another castle.
I said I was so thirsty I could swallow a flagon.
The truth is, I’m the one who needs saving.
I’d like to take you out as dinner...
You looked a little less dragony in your profile picture.
The flowers are a nice thought, but I don't think my father is going to invite going to welcome you to come in.
She said no, Ralph, 
Sorry.
Sorry. Our dragon eloped with a T Rex.
Did you think others at court wouldn't notice that you were cheating on me?
I can’t stomach your cooking.
Sorry, but I'm allergic to dragon lilies.
Weird flex but okay.
Shush! My father will hear you. I told you to wait for me by the enchanted well at 4:00, Mr. Overeager!
I just got him to put his helmet back on,
I'll send for you when he's gone.
Flowers?  Oh!   I'll call Deidre
I'm sorry, but I can't let father see you. He thinks you're a real monster!
It just really boils down to this: it's me, not you.
You better scoot off as quickly as you can, HotLips -- Georgie is on his way here.
I'm sorry. I mean it this time. I'll stop painting the town red.

We don’t want apologies. We want you to get the help you need.
If I kiss you, do you turn into DJT?
Go away before they see you.
I did knock!
I can't come now, he's still watching Game of Thrones
Oh, snap! Dragon's not for me.
Sorry, the princess refuses to call off the slaying.
How many times do I have to tell you? Donkey doesn't live here! Donkey doesn't exist! He's a character in a movie.
You Don't look like you did on your profile, but here, I brought you some flowers
No, no. Go away. This isn't how the story's supposed to end.
Bob, I do love you, but Mom and Dad have set me up with that damn unicorn, Luther!
I was waiting for Shrek; Donkey’s around the corner.
Georgie has been grounded for playing with sharp objects.
Just because it worked for Frankenstein, don’t think it will work for me!
You'll understand if I play hard to get.
Well, at least you’re not a horse.
Ok, but the air conditioning is broken so don't bring the heat.
Of course I like you. But your war crimes are hard to get past.
I''m allergic to flowers, but not to you!
I’m not sure what makes me more distressed, that you first tried to kill me with fire — and NOW kindness!!
Sooooo...I'm just curious. Have you seen 'Beauty and the Beast' by any chance?
You are late, AGAIN, and the Moat traffic excuse will not work this time Henry!
Don't knock it till you tried it.
Sorry to be the bearer of ill-tidings on Mother's Day but Daenerys kicked the royal bucket
All the undecideds have already fled the castle.
Oh, she went that way?
First impressions matter Drogon, and my mother is allergic to chickweed flowers! Choose something else.
And I thought you were HOT!
I pictured flying to Paris for dinner on your Tinder a little different
No, I'm afraid I won't be your tinder date. Under either usage of the word!
SORRY, She eloped with T
Rex.
I thought I told you to come at midnight when everyone's asleep.
After what you did to King’s Landing?  Forget it!
Please don’t take this the wrong way but you have really bad breath.
Go away, Her Highness and the Knights in Shining Armor haven’t finished  the list of repairs since your last visit to the kingdom.
I just think you’re too big to be dating an iguana.
Let me straighten up the quest room first?
I’m telling you for the last time, Khaleesi is so over you.
I hope she is not guarded by a vicious princess.
You're asking me out? Don't hold your breath, man... I mean, please do.
Sorry game of thrones is over.You're unemployed again.
I can't be your new Khaleesi, I'm voting for Bernie.
I think you would like my cousin, Griseltha. Her prince is much juicier.
My mom says that you are a fairy tale.
Keep your voice down! My father’s home1
I told you, you are not my type dear.
I prefer someone blond.
Is Siegfried home?
I didn't want to hurt your feelings​ but I can't stand your breath.
Now get out of here before my dad sees you!
Shhh! The folks are still asleep, try the tower later!
Sorry, I'm not feeling the fire.
I SAID FIRES NOT FLOWERS !
The princess said her other suitor is more fiery.
It's not me, it's your dragon breath.
But I like to eat sushi every once in a while.
Fireweed?
I am still burnt out from our first kiss.
Silly goose, it's every other Tuesday!
HBO says it’s moving on and that it wishes you the best of luck.
The only thing that can slay me is your beauty.
Ever hear of a chastity belt?
Mr. Dragon, may I ride your long hard tail again, tonight?
That’s sweet, but it’s not what they meant by, “Dragon Lady”.
Would she rather fire?
The damsel asks that you come back later. She had a tough knight.
I'd invite you in, but . . .
Oh my god, it’s you again!
I don't care what step you are on. It's over!
No. But you said we could enter at the South portico side!
You're taller than I imagined.
Did you call about furnace problems?
Daenerys who?
No offense, but she's more into the fiery passion type.
Ummm, you look a little different than your profile pic.
I'm here to pay my respects to the Khaleesi
You have the wrong address, they're the next castle over.
I'm afraid this is all that is left of him.  May I sleep on the ramparts tonight?
According to my therapist, you're no longer my type.
And don't forget the poem I wrote for you ... slay her with romance!
This better not be like that horse we let in.
Are you from postmates because that's not what we ordered?
OK I forgive you, how about coffee today, and we’ll see where that goes…
Just a moment while I put on the flame retardant slipcovers.
Father says yes but you will have to burn his enemy's army first.
Quit throwing rocks at my window.
Wow, you're much cuter than your profile pic!
I thought you said you are a straight arrow
Don’t get dragoned away!
Flowers?  Oh, you must be Grisella's new flame.
Auditions for series 4 of The Handmaid’s Tale are in the next block.

Sweetheart, I just need two more minutes!
She says, 'Sorry, but her heart still belongs to Jon Snow.'"
I'm just going to slip into something from my  Collection Asbestos de Paris
I told you to wait until The King was on Crusade!
Were you formerly known as Prince...

I told you never to call me here.
I accepted your apology for razing the village, I'm just not into the idea of being friends much less anything more
Watch your step.
This is just unprofessional
I don’t know if I’m ready for another date.  On our last date, you burned down my favorite restaurant.
Oh, darn. She just washed all the smoke out of her hair.
I can’t see you anymore.  I don’t know how to say this nicely, but you have real bad dragon breath.
Didn't you hear? I'm back with my old flame.
I told you, is no that I don't like you, the issue is your breath!
I guarantee my passion is more fiery than his.
Could you please wait  a moment? She's getting her blowtorch.
Sorry, Drago, I just don't feel the fire anymore.
Sorry, not yet. We need a positive I.D. We're still checking dental records.
Yes, your girlfriend is hot.
You're not the frog!
Sorry, I don't think you will fit in.
We're binge-watching "Game of Thrones." The King thinks they're home videos.
Please, not now - I haven't told my parents about you!
Another reason I can't marry you is because you're a dragon.
Go away, it was only a one night stand.
Forgive me, but we’re just incompatible; I’m royalty and, well, you’re a fire-breathing Welsh nationalist in want of an independent republic - love might well be blind, but I’m politically astute!
Go around back so TMZ doesn't get a scoop.
Nice of you to ask, but I"m already dating someone.
Got GOT?
I'm sorry, but the princess is receiving only fire breathing dragons.
I'd invite you in but the place is a mess.

Jeremy C. Miller, New York, NY
Sorry, I'm not ready for a serious relationship yet, my ex really burned me.
What’s the Prince got that I don’t?
Flowers aren’t going to cut it, she wants her jewels back.
Good news! Now that we extinguished all the princes, daddy agreed to a prenup.
Just leave the flowers and follow your bliss
Oh, hello!" (I would swear I swiped left... or is it right?
Ben? You don't look anything like your profile photo.
Stop picking my flowers.
Not now--Game of Thrones is on.
The doctor will see you now.
You have flowers, but the fire's gone.
Sorry, I'm not a damsel in distress
I  was expecting prince charming to propose to me;
not T-Rex!
Draco, are you delivering for FTD or Amazon these days?
You're late for the Game of Thrones finale and too early for the reunion, go away.
Sorry, I called for an Uber not a Drake.
It's not my fault you swiped right
That just might work, but there's still  the matter of your being able to fit through the door...
O Draco, Draco, wherefore art thou Draco?
Yes, I am Mrs Brown and yes I have a lovely daughter,
But no she isn’t here. She went out with some friends to roast marshmallows.
Thank you! But your princess is in another castle.
That's very sweet of you, but I am not your mother.
I told you we're done! I can't take your fire anymore!
Mother says I'm too young to date.
Princess Kardashian says to come back when you're sober.
So I’ll huff and puff and I’ll burn your place down.
She'll be right down...
Hi honey!  I’m sorry!
I’ll just be a minute, but if you see my ex don’t start grilling him about our past.
I wasn't sure you would come.
Sorry, but "Girlfriend of Dragons" is getting me nowhere.
She doesn't want to talk to you, she says you're a drag-on the relationship.
Thanks for your service
I’m sorry my father Lancelot would never approve.
Westeros Bachelor: He's coming to light your candles, ladies!
Sorry.  There's no smoking in this residence.
Sorry, but I'm allergic.
You're my prince?  An evil wizard turned you in to a dragon.
How distressing!
I'm sorry ,George can't come out to play, his horse is at the blacksmith.
I was actually calling for your brother, no insult intended.
Though Mother is admittedly a monster, Father has forbidden me from dating outside my species.
Oh, what a breath of fresh air.
I'm sorry, but they couldn't afford the production costs. Back to the books, huh?
I'm sorry, he's not home.
Wonder what will my next hot flash will bring?
I'm sorry. I just can't get past your bad breath.
Maybe I can start seeing you again in the prequel
We have to stop meeting like this.
I am not going to say whatever that mother of dragons told you.
I said can you please buy some mints?
Pete went away to college. Go find another friend to bother.
Not now. I said i’d text you when the coast was clear!
Didn’t your  agent tell you ?
Is little Jackie Paper home?
I'd rather we not burn this bridge.
She's been abducted by Sir Godfrey.  Any chance you could rescue her?
Daddy wants to know: can you torch our enemies?
Could you put those flowers back in my garden?
Finally, an accurate Ye Olde Tinder pic!
Uhhh, she'll be ready in a minute... but you don't exactly match your online profile.
Do something about your breath and we'll discuss starting a relationship.

I can’t go to the prom, I’m having wimple trouble.
I'm grounded for two weeks.  You brought me home past curfew the other night.
Have you been using the new mouthwash I recommended?
Pssst... can go round the back so my dad won't catch us!
I don't care if you are a prince among dragons-the princess doesn't date dragons!
Oh you poor dear, Game of Thrones is  over.
Well, he never brought me flowers.
Sorry, my Tinder profile specifically states that I'm looking for a unicorn.
Once you go fire breathing Dragon you don't quit smokin.
Are you a magic dragon or just a dragon who does magic?
I don't think the Prince plays for your team.
Yes, the burns ARE serious. He doesn't want to see you.
The princess said to tell you that she kissed the frog last night.
Will I fit in ? A part of me wants to turn around and run
Oh yes, I’m your Uber driver .
We use Wind  energy only.
You can come in if you promise not to breathe fire on my parents.
No, you can't visit their graves!
She's says she'll be ready in five minutes, but don't . . . ah, never mind.
Did you pick those in the castle gardens ?
It's not a good time, I'm having with George, an old flame.
Are those flowers or fried eggs?
Oh, your profile said you were taller.
You have handsome qualities, but I prefer indoor courtship and worry about how you’d fit in.
I like tallness in a male.
Sorry, she says she won't go the prom with a dragon queen
It won't work; you're from a red state and I'm from a blue one "
Leave, quickly, lest my husband slay us both!
Wipe your talons before you enter, please.
I don’t know if this is the best time. After your family burned down the village last night, my parents are sort of second guessing our relationship.
Haven’t you seen Beauty and the Beast? Well, whaddya say?
Just a minute. Daddy wants to meet you.
I'm sorry, we're team Winterfell.
My parents don't believe in mixed marriages.
Sorry - there just aren't any sparks.
I will kiss thee, but thou best be a king.
I was hoping for more fireworks and sparks.
You're just too flighty.  It's really over.
Are you crazy?! What if my husband sees you?
Galathor, I told you the princess is no longer seeing suitors. I, on the other hand, am available....
You’re a bit late for Mother’s Day.
Is Dani home?
I'm not going out on a knight like this!
Sylvia's busy.
Follow my tail and we’ll hit some clubs!
You can come in, but don’t let my father know you’re “dragonish”.
I ordered roses, not daisies!
You'll have to wait. The king is still here.
Lovely flowers. He'll be back by 11: 00, but we'll be fine until then
I’m sorry; I’m just not into mythology!
Tell Jon Snow he knows nothing!
Forget-Me-Nots? You gotta be kiddin’!”
The Princess says the flowers are always nice, but sometimes a lady just wishes to be suddenly swept up, and flown away on an exciting adventure.
You seemed taller in your profile
Sorry, after the King's Landing incident I'm off dragons.
Not a headache, I've got two knights.
Oh, you are much larger than you looked on your profile photo on the dating site.
Wait a sec. I have to get my fire retardant helmet so you can whisper sweet nothings in my ear.
Something about sleighing because winter is coming
Can Jackie come out to frolic?
If you’re going to drop by, please text me first.
Hi. She'll be down in five minutes!
'He says he is sorry. It's not his fault that he IS a monster.'
Remember young man, no burning on the first date.
Playing with fire.
I accidentally ate the guy who makes the chocolates.
If you can't even fit in the front door, then how are you supposed to fit in my back door?
She is busy right now. Leave your business card, stating the purpose of your visit.
Princess Belle, your date for the royal party has arrived.
Go away! I said draconian no dragon.
Sorry, Happy Hour begins at 5 o'clock  on Saturdays, not 4.
She said she doesn’t want to see you. It’s your breath.
Quick, come in....George just went to a joust.
Sorry, but I'm waiting for a frog to kiss.
Mother said, "clean your feet and tail before you enter".
I really enjoyed reading your email.
Well, it means to quit dragon your feet, and cross crossing moats off your list, mostly.
My parents you’re just not our kind.
Spoiler Alert: She loves you not!
You’ll have to do better than that!
Shush!  My parents are still awake.
What, we’re they out of frog costumes?
Did you get tbose from my garden?
Little Jackie Paper, will you please frolic in the autumn mist with me in a land called Honahlee?
Ich am besorgian for ruining thou's garden.
Oh, I’m so sorry. I’m already going out with Godzilla.
Please kiss me, I’m tired of being a dragon
The knight you were expecting suddenly became ill. He is burning up with a fever.
I told you my dad doesn't want me seeing any anyone from the other side of the moat.
Not till you do something about that breath!
Uh, looks like he is going to kill him with kindness instead.
I didn’t like the Game of Thrones finale either.
Oh, you're a lot smaller than you said you were on Tinder.
I don't think I'm ready to be rescued yet.
Sorry! I'm allergic to flowers.
This is what they send me when I order dragonfruit?
I'm sorry, but she doesn't have the same fire in her belly as you have in yours
Not "spurned", "burned".  Go away.
I grew them myself.
Sorry.  From your profile photo, I was expecting a toad.
Sorry, you have bad breath.
Wrong castle.  Our florist makes deliveries with a trundle.
I'm so sorry sir, but my father said I can't see you anymore, he said that your personality was too firey
Prince Charming is more likely to show up if he sees me.
Alas! I don’t think my family can see past the damsel-in-distress and dragon-slaying paradigm.
She doesn't want to kiss you!
You look shorter in your Tinder profile picture.
I'm sorry. Our castle is flower-free.
If I go on a date with you, will you stop roasting my knights?
Oh you don’t look like you did in your Tinder picture
Oops! I meant to swipe LEFT.
Well, I've actually met Prince Carson. He doesn't have that dragon breath.
Not now
When I mentioned powerful dragon's breath, it wasn't a complement.
Sorry, but your Tinder profile said you were 6'1".
Shh come in quick before the others show up.
God, you are such a Drag...go on with your life!
I’ll have to see your Maiden Devouring License before I check to see if you are on the approved list.
Are you kidding? No way. I've been burned before.
The prince isn't actually home right now, but I'm sure he'll be flattered.
She said, leave the flowers, but she doesn't want to see you any more.
Is it too late to audition?
Give me a minute...I'd better change into my fireproof outfit.
Could you please tell Gwendolen that I found her earrings.
I don't care if you turn into the Prince of  bloomin' Wales. No kisses!
We are the welcome committee but I am afraid to knock
You looked different on your Tinder profile.
Father won't let me court boys with scales"
You can enter by scaling the wall ... I'll take the flowers to make it easier on you.
You are bigger than I expected from your profile on Dating Singles website.
Walk This Way
You can't come in until Jeapardy's over.
You don't look like your photo in the dating app.
If you don’t get out of here with that stupid boquet I’ll call George
Sir Gwain.  You have two visitors.
They said you were a hot sooter, but can you cook?
Khaleesi no here.
George thinks your friendship request is a load of hot air.
Tell them I've changed.
Are you sure you have the right castle?
Sorry, you are just not my type.
It's nothing personal..my father the king slaid my last boyfriend as well.
Your chivalry has been sweet,but take care as I'm now dating a knight.
It's going to take more than two flowers to make up for your fiery disposition."
He just got in, but I can let you in through the back.
Sorry about the bad breath.
Sorry baby maybe another night,I'm feeling bloated
She can't come down.  She's just washed her hair.
Lily was tempted, as he seemed so nice!
I'm sorry,but I just don't feel the heat.
I'm a water sign. Don't tell my father we're dating.
Don't hold your breath, the princess is washing her hair.
Nice try. You picked those from my garden
I'm sorry, you gave her a case of heartburn.
Well, Drogon, you certainly know how to breathe fire into your online dating profile.
I know we come from different backgrounds...
Oh, you looked a little different in your Tinder profile...
No, I never watched Games of Thrones
For the last time, I just can’t get over your breath.
This is the last time I let Daenerys set me up on a blind date.
Sorry, but I have a date with a toad.
I understand your confusion, but, no, Sir Lancelot is not dating.
She said to tell you "sorry, but it'sjust not working out"
Verily, he saith to stick them where the sun doth not shine.
Don't Worry, Princess. The tail is only for show.
You failed the Princess’ breath test.
Let's frolic in the autumn mist.
Flowers are nice, but just say the words—say you're sorry. It's that simple!"
"How was I supposed to know regicide was illegal? It sounds like a foot cream!
I've decided to try a new approach.
Sorry but the Princess is not seeing anyone who cannot fit through this door.
It sorrows me to say, Durrell, but our story must end here
I am so sorry, but she ran into Saint George on the road last week
I like you better when you breathe fire!
It's just carolers, honey!
My parents won't allow me to go on a hot date.
I’m here for my date with Belle.
Flowers?  Where's the shining armor?
Sorry. Daenerys doesn’t live here anymore.
He says to tell you thanks for the flowers, and to remind you that he'll kill you, if it's the last thing he ever does, as soon as his burns heal.
She said to leave the flowers in the moat
Don't worry, I ran out of fire.
The princess says for you to wipe off your feet in the moat first.
You're too late.  I already kissed the frog and I don't need another prince.
...and you've got to do something about your breath...
I only date 6'1" satyrs. Sorry.
I'm waiting for the Greeks bearing gifts, frankly.
Go away! The troll will be back in any minute.
Oh hey sorry I'm going to have to reschedule...how's next fortnight?
I'm sorry, Doug, but I'm looking for someone with more fire in his belly.
Quick, and if we run into dad please don’t toast him!
I hope you enjoyed the flame-broiled appetizers.
Daenerys's sister, I presume.
The "How to Train Your Dragon" franchise has become really cheesey.
The princess can't go out with you tonight. She's watching Game of Thrones.
By the way, did you know that ‘sitting’ is the new ‘smoking’?
The flowers are a nice touch, but your breath smells of Fireball.
Sarah doesn't want to see you anymore. Please go back home
Good for you, but it's the spark between us that's fully gone.
Oh, I'm sorry, I though I swept left.
Seriously, have you tried breath mints?
Um, he went that away.
Truly, dear damsel -- my life has so much more direction and purpose since giving up the fire-breathing. Call me a repentant serpent!
Are you crazy? My father with LITERALLY kill you!
You're obviously Montessori trained.
The princess said you're not her old flame.
The Trojan Dragon
She's over you... since Game of Thrones has ended.
I'd rather watch the final episode alone.
The citizens of Meernan say that it's too early for apologies.
Why are you so late? Get your tail in here!
I'm sorry, but my parents say that I can't go out with anyone with wings. (Meet me by the stables once they are asleep...)
Papa will never approve!
My cousin Arthur ate all the red roses!"
hey mom, dads home!
Princess Rhea will be back in an hour, hold on.
"Do come in -- but please, no fire-breathing inside the castle.
We don't buy flowers. Sorry.
But I brought flowers!!
Are you for real?
Shhh, Beowulf is still up. Come back in an hour
For our consideration? For the last time Drogon, we’re not Emmy voters.
No thanks. You'd just lead me to burn up the city and be a bad queen.
'Game of Thrones' isn't the only drama that's over."
You don't look anything like your dating app photo either.
I appreciate the flowers, but have you tried a breath mint?
Sorry, the princess said she's waiting for a knight in shining armor, not a dragon whose fire will harm her.
Your Mother of Dragons doesn't live here anymore.
I told you it was just one of those things.
I didn't want to use draconian measures, but I have a restraining order.
I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but your breath is killing me.
Look, she doesn't want to see you after your incendiary remarks.
I was expecting a bigger dragon.
I'm sorry, the donkey was here first.
Do I slay you the way you slay me?
You haven’t heard, Dany is dead.
My Dearest, I have brought you a little surprise from yon nearby meadow.  I no longer breathe flames for you have become the fire of my heart!!!
She wants you to "stop dragon her heart around."
Sorry. She still hasn't fully recovered from your last fiery kiss.
Oh, Puff? Sorry, I didn't recognize you from your photo on Tumblr.
I’m feeling vulnerable, can we role play this another time?
I'm sorry,  but Lady Marian isn't in. Care to leave a message?
Only two flowers this time?
Draco dormiens numquam a tickle.
I'm sorry. Your princess is in another castle.
You're to late, Daenerys is dead!
Only two flowers?
I appreciate the flowers but you still haven’t qualified for the debates.
You've lit a fire in my chest, Susan."  "That's what I was afraid of.
Let me get the paper bag
Is this a bad once upon a time?
Ok, but you'll have to be quiet.
Could you possibly come back after the apocalypse?
I know you're sorry, Drogon, but the people of King's Landing are still upset with you...
YO ADRIAN !
I wish you could come in.
I'm flattered, I am, but the truth is...I am deathly allergic to daisies.
No, no it's fine I was just expecting...a Wyvern, is all.
Do you have a vase I can borrow?
Nope. She is still ticked about frying the Prince.
My father wants to know if your intentions are flammable.
Hey you buzz off!”
I got burned by you once,
I won’t let it happen again
You’ll have to come next week. It’s that time of the month.
Sorry, this is a "No Fire Zone."
Oh be realistic for once, would you?
You got rid of the others?
Just when I thought the fire was gone.
You definitely need to update your profile pic.
Picking flowers?  What kind of guard dragon are you?
Is it safe to kiss you?
I'll wipe my feet, I promise.
You look NOTHING like your dating profile pics!
Wow, you look nothing like your profile picture...
Go away ! My husband will be home soon !!!
I already told you that we can only be friends
I told you, m'lady prefers the nastier dragons.
Yes, He did get your last letter. He says he’ll meet you at the DMZ.
Who did you say? Dinah who?
Sorry, I was only interested because you were an extra on the Game of Thrones ...
The daisies are nice, but you know I prefer dragon's breath.
I'm sorry.  She's gone extinct.
You simply slay me!
A toad is meant to become my Prince Charming.
I'd love to invite you in, but...
No,we're not mormon.
I've changed my mind, after seeing your profile.
But, you still have dragon breath.
Come quick, before my parents see you.
Most dragons bring wine, but flowers are okay too I guess.
Dragon Lady?  Hmm, does sound fun.
Flowers aren't really much of a housewarming gift, are they?
I’m so sorry, Romeo. Father says I can’t come out.
I don't believe in fairy tales.
Sorry, our chemistry is mythical.
It's time to move on from the dark ages.
I just want to apologize for burning the city.
Do something about that breath
You can't just drop by...my George is no Saint!
As one Bruce Lee fan to another, enter the dragon.
After I give him more three more ales, you can ask him for my hand.
Fool me the 73rd time, shame on me!
But are you willing to slay yourself?
I made herself queen by slaying my own dragons.
Let's put those flowers in a vase while you wait for her.
I can't help it if I fell in love with their dog.
I know you're a big fan of disintermediation, but where the hell is Lancelot
It appears that you're happy to see me.
I don't think we have a vase that big.
Daenerys  lives in the castle next-door.
Did you remember your mouthwash?
You misunderstand hot-and-bothered.
FTD? WTH!
I'll call you.
He’ll be right out.
Another story for Catfish.
No, I'm not disappointed -- it's just you're much greener than your photo on Match.com.
Will those flowers attract the bees?
Does your lair have wifi?
Honey, you're elegant.  Let's pick another place to meet.
I know now that when you said that you were hung like a dragon you meant you have a micropeen.
What... I'm here from flowersdragons.com ?
I apologize. I promise that I will not singe your hair next time.
This isn't Beauty and the Beast!
I’m sorry, I’m seeing someone else.
Sorry, but I never rekindle  to an old flame.
M’lady is indisposed. Leave the flowers and your calling card. We’ll  see what tomorrow brings.
“Flowers are great but what we need something more to fire up our relationship.”
Come in quickly.  Everyone's out on a siege.
Edelweiss
Sorry, kissed a toad, a pig, and yes, you are cute, but been there done that!
The flowers are not a ploy to kidnap you.
He said he won't give you permission to marry me.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Well do you at least have a white horse?
I won‘t allow it! This is not your rom-com crash the wedding moment.
Show's over pal!
Sorry but not sorry, I ordered the ferocious dragon and they send the romantic one.
Alright. We'll try it your way.
Oh D! I can't drag on anymore...
You don’t look at all like your picture.
Can I help you?
Oh dear!  He's on Amazon again.
No, Alisa cannot go to a wienie roast with you.
No pansies allowed
In light of recent events we're reevaluating our public-facing operations. So you're a gardener now.
It's not because your a dragon, it's because your Jewish.
Deliveries go to the back gate
Oh, that is where you would put a long cone hat.
She is not back from her date with the ogre yet.
I come in peace, I am in love and I am a dragon
Flowers won't make us forget that your roasted him.
Hi is Donkey in?
I told you to come to the back door.
We need to be discrete -- use the back door!
I said Pangorian orchids.
I want to apologize for ruining the cookout
Milady says you're too late, the season is over. Between you, me and the gatepost, she can't handle another disappointing episode.
No, Daenerys doesn't live here. Next castle over.
Oh, She is in the back moat. I will tell her that you are here.
It's your breath, TBH...
No, the Knight is too young to come out and play.
Not tonight, Morris. I have a headache.
I'm sorry but I'm engaged to a giant ape.
I’m so sorry for your loss ...but the Targaryens live down the road.
Well, I don't see any reason to accept your offer of courtship, considering last week you torched the Village Green and all the jesters, minstrels, troubadours, acrobats and jugglers.
Sorry. The mother of dragons lives in the next castle"
Khaleesi says she's the single mother of dragons.
I thought you’d be taller.
YOU NEVER WARNED ME ABOUT THE MOAT
I thought my aunt asked me to meet a kind dragoon. It’s a case of a missing o,
Look, I'm not going to marry you, so there's no reason for your courtship to drag on."
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in!"
Pansies? I was think more like 'burning bush' !
Take your Gerrymandering elsewhere,we're watching World Cup.
No, I said two hours.
Our fans won’t like this ending.
Careful, I just replaced that bridge you burned.
Mom thinks your hot breath can only lead to trouble.  So, I guess that’s it.  Sorry.
Tiger lilies I presume?
You can turn off your GPs now
Why are those flowers bigger than my head?
Marry me, or thou shalt suffer the woes of climate change!
My life for two lousy flowers? Wait till George hears about this.
From now on you can land in the court yard like all the other dragons.
Here I am as I was then.
You were expecting Shrek, weren't you?

No! I don't want my imprisonment to be legally binding!
I'm not allowed to receive flowers from reptiles.
What!? Never heard of a dragon giving flowers?
My new boyfriend is so hot, he literary breathes fire.
which fair maiden would you like to speak to?
if i'm not back before my curfew my dad will send an entire army to kill you
i think i had the wrong amphibian in mind
She likes the strong macho type... I'd ditch the flowers and go with the  mighty fire-breathing dragon approach.
Two flowers? What happened to that fire you used to have?
It’s just a bad time- my pet rat’s gotten loose and I can’t seem to find him
Is the Princess home?
Oh dear, Juliet is out hunting for potential husbands.
I'm sorry, Gerald, but Father says I have to marry someone with better job prospects.
Sorry, not into bad boys . . .
Just wait a few minutes, Sir Gwaine will be right down.
He says he’ll be down in five minutes.
You should have called first...
I have snacks waiting for you in the dungeon.
You'll have to leave those outside. She's allergic to pollen
Sorry, but the princess is in another castle.
Sorry, I only kiss amphibians.
I'm sorry. I got hot-headed and said some stuff I didn't mean...
I can't let you in ... I'm allergic to flowers.
You look surprisingly like your profile picture.
No thanks...my email said 'life drags on without flowers' but I was not expecting delivery at the castle!
Oh, sorry, I thought you were Uber eats.
I've told you so often -- don't come to my house!
No more long drawn out tales.
Quietly seek in through the top left window.
And by the way, Slay is not a cool nickname.
Will you join me as dinner?
You're early. I just need a few more minutes to finish dressing.
Did you eat the gardener again?
I"m sorry Dino. I don't think it would work.....Physically.
I thought this was the casting call for the Game of Thrones sequel!
I despise your whole persona but I like your policies.
Did you tell your parents?
Come back later. He’s still home.
She is busy kissing a frog...sorry
My father doesn't want us to see each other anymore.
Not the “fiery” personality I was looking for.
Come on in.  The paleontologists have been looking for you.
Sorry, you're not my type.
Okay, let’s fly, but no touching below the waist, or incinerations.
How appropriate! My favorite flowers. Dragon lilies.
I'm sorry, but I'm a sucker for the bad boys.
We need to talk.
Hot for teacher
Be patient; she's on the line with St. George.
Sorry Dany and Jon have moved to the North!

I've come for a kiss
Aren't you supposed to huff and puff and blow my house down?
Lady Annabel says her dungeon is occupied right now.
I'm sorry, we're just too different. And besides, how would you get in the door?
I'm following my heart, not my tail.
She’s not ready to talk to you. She says you’re a cool-blooded snake and that she never should have let you burn her again. The flowers are a nice Tolkien though.
I have to wash my hair tonight.
I'm sorry, but I no longer date reptiles.
I KNOW that my posting said that I liked hot men, but this, this is ridiculous!
Don't hold your breath!"
Be patient. My parents go on a progress next Wednesday...
DNA test or not- she says she is not your mother.
She is not looking for someone with a firey personality.
Oh no!  Didn’t you hear?  Daenerys is dead!
Those don't look like roses.
The princess is almost ready, deary.  She thinks this will be the most exciting wedding ever!
Didn't you get my text?  My parents came back early
I'm sorry I got so hot-headed yesterday.
Running for president? Can’t you fly?
You could certainly use a breath mint.
“She just told me to tell you “all smoke and no fire just does not work for her “
Sorry, but I can't marry anyone whose career plan is to fly around and breathe fire.
Welcome! Do you remember how to play Duck a Low Bridge?
Flowers, how sweet. Yes, I'd love to go for a walk with you if you promise not to eat me.
He asks if you have any cough drops; his throat is on fire.
I’m sorry, Rapunzel says she’s still washing her hair.
I'd like to apologize for last night's kiss gone HORRIBLY wrong.

Guillermo Del Toro chosen to direct "Dragonheart" reboot.
I only date unicorns.
I really need you to get on the ball with the fire, so I can get out of here...the flowers are nice, though.
Mr. Throne, go away, it isn't your time yet !
Her Highness says with your hot tongue pansies are no longer needed!
I'm sorry.  There be no dragons here.
She went that way.
I'm sorry.  But it's my policy is not to ravage the countryside on the first date.
Of course Mumsy forgives Snookums for the village you torched.
Sneak around the back...  Papa won't see you
I don't care if you were on Game of  Thrones, i'm not interested in dating you.
Quiet, please.  My parents are taking the Royal midday nap.
You don't look anything at all like your picture on beauty and beast dot com.
You think a lousy two flower bouquet is going to forgive what you did!?
Sorry...I draw the line at frogs.
Saint George would like to see you first.
Daenerys told me to come by this week. What?!
Tell her I know I'm late, but my GPS sent me to the right address but the wrong city.
Dad says I have to be in by 9pm.
What do you mean she wasn't your type.
You're cuter than you looked on Instagram.
A rendez-vour
St. George??
No excuse Barbeque Breath.  You’re too late for Contest #666.
For heaven's sake, Fafnir!  I told you to let me talk to Daddy first!
It seems that she had  swiped right more than once.
How long have you been using mismatch.com?
Do I have a tail to tell
I'd ask you in, but you are too large to fit.
This is an emergency call for the local moat builder!
Are you here to apologize?
I've told you a dozen times that we do not accept lodgers.
new phone who dis???
Flowers are a good start, but you really need to fix the dragon breath if your serious about dating the Queen.
But I specifically said "p.m."!
I will just blow you a kiss. Do something about the breath dear . Tat
Or we could just hire a handmouse and go to a cheese bar?
You are a little rough around the edges
I’m sorry you burned your tongue after our kiss.
The show's over!
I'm burning I'm burning I'm burning for you
You look different from your tinder profile picture.
Sorry, I just don’t think we are the next Romeo and Juliet
You're looking for my sister.
She's the next castle down.
The dog doesn’t like strangers.
Little Jackie doesn’t come here anymore.
Good timing...my hairdryer just went on the fritz.
I meant the other back door
Can't you read?  My profile said I'm allergic to flowers!!
I said slay the beast within!
Posy is not the password, you idiot!
Uh, yes, hello. I'm here to pick up my true dragon for prom.
I’m sorry, but Fido can’t play today, we ate him.
Will grab my heels.
But you didn’t even say hi to me when you were burning down the kingdom?
Please keep your mouth shut.
I promise this will have no effect on my job performance.
She doesn’t want to see you.
Not today my love, my dad’s still too fired up about your last visit.
You're sweet, but reverse Stockholm syndrome has always been a huge turn-off for me.
Just a second. I have to put on my fire retardant dress.
You definitely did not look like that on your tinder profile.
Haven't you heard? Chivalry hasn't been born yet.
My daddy says no.  I must wait until I'm 16 before I date.
The back door-- I said come to the back door!
Love your begonias, but leave them and begone yourself, thank you.
You better come around the back moat.
Chivalry is dead.
You're too fiery for me.
I've been burned one too many times.
I’m sorry but it’s your breath.
Quick, around to the backdoor.
She's mad because you forgot Mother's Day.
I told you to use the back door so no one would notice you!
He says he's hot to trot.
Sorry I don’t date Gemini’s
Sorry, Margaret’s out with a man named George.
And I thought my breath was bad.
I'm sorry, she said to tell you she's sick of reptiles.
I told you, I'm done being your damsel!
You're not going to wear that on  first date, are you?
I guess it's really over -- HBO won't answer the door.
I’m so sorry, Jeremy, tonight’s dinner is for Chimeras and Minatours—dinner for dragons was last night.
I'm sorry, but I only date fictional characters in my head.
You promise to have her home by nine...?
I can’t go tonight. Ever since you scorched the castle wall, my dad is ready to crown you!
Is the Fair Maiden home?
Oh daisies, my absolute favorites!
I just hope you don’t still live with your parents.
No, not me.  You are looking for the castle a mile down the road."
Can Karen come out and play?
Are you here begging to reshoot the ending?
We will adopt? Cold day in....
I gave at the office.
He's not here—he just went bowling with Kyle.

Sorry I didn’t return your texts. 
I can’t charge my phone in here.
Your Tinder search was looking for someone old-fashioned
Father said I can no longer see you Marvin.
Are you a relative of the BFG?
Two minutes!
I'm sorry, but the last dragon I saw resulted in a destructive relationship.
I know you're sorry but breathing fire on me while we were making out is inexcusable.
I thought that you weren't a racist!
Feeling a little burnt. Sorry to cancel at the last minute.
Too little, too late.
You know, I thought you would be taller.
I simply don't share your raging hot fire in the belly.
Let me get my fireproof suit and i’m yours.
George sent me
Really?
She's not interested.
Miss Rapunzel says she may be a while.  She’s drying her hair.
Not tonight I have a headache and heartburn.
From last week (my magazine came too late): “It’s Swedish for, “cheese not included.”
Delivery for Mr. Snow
Sorry, remind me - you're the David from Hinge, or Tinder?
Rapunzel ... they said you'd be on the roof.
He looks threatening, but he brought flowers.
Can you wait until I watch the last episode of Game of Thrones?
I’d invite you in but my dad still gets a bit testy about you being dressed in dragon.
But you never would have called if I had put my REAL picture on the website!
Sorry but my horoscope says you’re not good for me for another five years.
Sorry Cersei
Our ride is hear to take us to the ball.
Is the Kaleesi in?
Terribly sorry, sir, but your princess is at another castle.
He's here to apologize.  He thought when you let down your hair you wanted a haircut!
George is caught up on other things right now.
Too late for the job interview.  The final episode was 2 months ago.
Your my Prince Charming?  You don't look like your profile picture on ECharming.
Come on in, my father would like to discuss your condiment selection.
I told you I was allergic to petunias
Uh; I was just wondering if we could talk?
Face it fire breath, you're just not for me.
You really should update your tinder profile.
Miranda will be out in a few minutes. She's taking a dump.
About time you got here, my parents are waiting on the roof.
The princess is still mad you burned her stack of records.
The King and Queen are at home
I can't talk right now. Father's home.
I come a-courtin' that princess puss!
She says she’s sorry...it’s her, not you.
You’ll see. Your folks will come around once they see my portfolio.”
Candy, not flowers
I,m sorry, but Samantha's not home right now.
Oh, my love, let me fly with you!
Shhhh!  Get outta here!  He's not leaving on the Crusade until tomorrow.....come back tomorrow afternoon!...
She says you're hopelessly naive and sweet. She needs more fiery passion
She's not here right now.  She's getting her nails done.
How am I supposed to fit through that tiny door?
I told you I can see you tonight because the king is home!
I wished for Snapdragons, not Daisydragons
Psst....before you meet Father, you better run home and get some clothes on!
I can't right now, I'm watching the end of Game of Thrones.
Your tail wasn’t so long on your Match photo!
Am I the first to arrive?
You're not Donkey!
She says she doesn't want to speaketh to you.
It's no secret we are DGBT...
Pfft. You think flowers will make up for torching my date?
try to be quiet or you'll wake the gargoyles
My username is actually, Lady of the Knight.
No roses?
I thought the “D” in FDS stood for delivery not dragon.
Mummys okay with it,but the King says you're too old.
You're a lot taller than your you looked on your profile.
She has an inflamed throat.
We do appreciate you taking her to the Ball.  Will you be needing the carriage or could you just fly?
I said a bouquet of snapdragons, not a seated dragon.
Flowers are nice, but I'm holding out for the Seven Kingdoms.
Come back when Ye do something about Thou foul breath!
I am sorry.  She is still not over that last scorch.  Try again tomorrow.
Oh, you looked scarier in your profile picture.
Keep this up and they will name a flower after you!
Ditch the flowers. I told them we were just friends.
Not exactly like your profile photo, but hey, you only live once.
It's a sweet gesture, but those flowers don't make up for your breath.
Meet me at the back door.
I'm not your mom; she was killed by the writers' haste to work on Star Wars
i am so sorry m`lady eloped last night with your brother.
My condolences. Sir George was a valiant man. And crunchy, too.
And have her home by 9.
Unexpected, but this might work. My X wore shining armor.
Listen, I can't just fly off with you for a weekend after only one date.
Although there are obstacles, we can make it work.
You got a lotta nerve showing up here.
For the last time, Hilda said, flowers will not start the fire!
Try to understand. GOT is over. I'm now watching DARK.
I can only let you in if you swear the new hiccup treatment is working.
Sorry, it would never work, too much heartburn...
Stay away from our daughter or George will come out and slay you too.
Rapunzel's at the hairdresser. Come back later.
My father does not approve our courtship.
That's very kind, but given the circumstances of her death, we are asking that in lieu of flowers all mourners to contribute to the World Without Dragons Association.
I told you-do something about your dragon breath!
You know I'm allergic to chrysanthemums!
Shh, we don't want George to find out.
‘’‘ It will take more than flowers to convince me you are my late husband ,George.’’
Honey, the BACK door !
The crusades ended early.....so beat it.
You looked different in your portraits
Actually, I'm here to see that cute little Tyrannosaurus if she around today."
He's not going away, Princess.  He said you swiped right.
Once the “Ding-Dong-Moat” went south, Gerald was forced to improvise.
Sorry, I'm more into frogs than lizards
You don’t realize how your words hurt me!
Not until you do something about that fiery breath...perhaps a mint.
I guess you missed the last episode. Spoiler alert...
I don't watch HBO.
It's too late to apologize!
She's said go away, she's moving on, you have no ambition, no fire in your belly.
You're a monster Pete.
Whoa, you don't look anything like you're Tinder picture.
But will you still respect me in the morning?
She said to tell you to breathe fire on someone else.
Hey, big guy.
Daisies???  Come back when you have roses.
Yes, you are the king of fire. But the queen is taken.
It was a one time thing - fly, dragon fly.
But you're supposed to be up there!
I'm sorry Sir Rodney can't come out to play. He's been a bad boy.
Oops.... fire hazard!
I'm sorry, but the home fire is quite all right now.  We keep it burning all the time.
I’ll tell Norberta you’re here.”
The fairy tale died eight years ago but what a difference a day makes.
I wont burn you like the others.
Wrong castle, our princess kissed the frog, you want the one with the tower in the sky!
I told you to snap three times!
The back door, Stanley, I told you before.
You said your first date was hot. She said she's still singed.
No one is to see you.  You were suppose to sneak in the back door.
What are your intentions?
Hmmmm.  Your profile pic made you look a bit more like a unicorn.
I told you the backdoor - my mother will never approve.
Hello, St. George in Utah calling...
Go away. You've burned me for the last time.
Gulp.
You look Maleficent.
I have a pointy hat, but I'm still not your type.
Shhh. I don't want my parents to know.
What's dragging me here?
Be quiet, you'll wake George
Technically, yes, you are a Drake look-alike.
Sorry, I don't date outside my race.
Although it's a blind date, this is a little unexpected.
My ID? ...Do I really look that young?
Ok, but we have to walk. I’m grounded
Esmiralda, your date’s here!
Yeah, pretty good. Yourself?
In distress...?  Sorry, not here.
I'm sorry, but there's no one named Daenerys here.
Hi everyone oh, I brought my new boyfriend.
You are the wrong Zodiac sign ! ! !
No more mail order Wizards. You're no frog.
I have taken ten anti-acid tablets. Did not drink any gasoline or kerosene for a month. Garbled repeatedly with mouthwash. I hope she likes me.
No, William. Shawna is out with Johnnie, binge watching Game of Thrones.
Hello, please tell the your daughter that the prince sent me.
Flowers are nice, but I prefer candy.
She can't come to the door. She's watching Pete's Dragon.
Oh, how sweet!  The delivery entrance is on the side.
It wasn't pointed at YOU. Is he in?
Henry, I told you my husband came home early on Fridays.
I’m sorry, Wyvern can’t come out to play right now.
She says she can only see you in the forest, like before.
Great!  Just on time to start the flambe.
Episode 1: Game of Hormones
The rest of them don't look like me.
Oh honey, I’m so sorry. She died in the final episode.
Do you have any gum? The King is home and wants to meet you.
The sign said no solicitors!
I'm sorry. You're just not my type.
No, I can’t spare a match!
Hold on, my parents want to meet you.
You’ve been “draggin”  your feet coming over here... my dad told me that one.
Shhh I'll be right out. Daddy's been watching reruns of Game of Thrones.
Sorry, she usually goes for fire in the heart, not the belly.
Yiannopoulos invites you to the straight pride parade.
Please leave or Daenerys will go apeshit!
I'm sorry, fire breathing potential suitors for the princess were to apply last week.
I'm sorry but some flowers and a suggestion that it was all Kahleesi's idea doesn't change my mind about you...
You look older than your profile picture.
The king says to have her back by 9:00 p.m.
and no more loop-de-loops.
We don't want any.
One of his majesty's dragoons my eye!
Sorry but she is still in the shower. She should be ready in about 30 minutes...
Look Steve, this just isn’t going to work!  You’re from the wrong side of the moat!
...The Welsh ambassador sent you?
I love you with a fiery passion.
Would you believe me if I said I was the knight?
Is it because I’m black?
You’ve got to use the back door
No no, none of our damsels need any distress.
Your late husband begged me to drop these off and tell you he's sorry he tried to cheat on you with my mum!
Warmer. You're super warm!
Bobby can’t come out. He’s grounded for wrecking havoc for no apparent reason.
YOU'RE EARLY (quick, Godzilla, hide in the closet)
Gosh, I only bothered to put on this silly hat.
Can you share any Game of Thrones gossip?
I’m sorry but I just like you as a friend
Mouthwash should do the trick.
I don’t care how much gold you’ve hoarded, I told you I’m not interested.
Sorry. She and her friend Rapunzel are washing their hair tonight.
She didn't say she was hot for you, she said she was hot around you, when you exhale. Sorry.
It’s a case of explosive gas.
Sorry about the Prince
Wait I have to brush my dragon's  breath
What interspecies courting looks like.
Mummy says flowers can’t replace her prized stallions.
I’m sorry too, but after Dad caught us flying around last night, he grounded me.
I'd invite you in if it weren't for the fire-breathing thing.
Sweetie, I want a fire breather.
You've lost the fire that was in your belly. I've lost the love that was in my heart.
I let down my hair to the wrong guy
I'm sorry, but she's still in the burn center.
You look nothing like your profile.
Would you like to make a donation to Habitat for Mythology?
The flowers are lovely but could you heat up my gruel?
Your Bronx accent is so thick - I thought you were saying 'a damsel in distress,' not a 'damsel in this dress.'
I can't afford another village burned down every time you sneeze.
Duck behind something before my dad sees you!")
Please, make your regal choice, Madam: it’s either odd me or very even number of flowers”.
There's still some kind of fear of flying going on . . .Give her a little more time . . .
Hello, I was hoping you could bring some of your delicious, er, beautiful children out to play?
Daddy found your E-cigarette!
I'm sorry.  If you were SERIOUS, you'd have brought me colored flowers.
I'd like to make up for scorching all your armies, your homes and women and your children. My mother made me do it. Kisses."
Princess, Dibo is here with your gift.
Where were you while the final season was going to crap?
You've ruined our entire Game of Thrones relationship with how you ended things, you're not coming back from that.
You can't come in because you won't fit.
I'm sorry, it would never work out...it's...it's your breath!
Not today, Draco, dear!  St. George is visiting my folks!
She says the flowers won't cut it. The burns from your last date are still healing.
Come back when you have free pizza.
How sweet of you to bring her flowers, but unfortunately she is a bit under the weather.
Oh my God, I've been catfished!
Just a minute.  I'll see if St. George is in.
I'm sorry,
Pete's here and his stamina is much better.
Pssssst....try to look a little more ferocious.
OK, but cool the fire, you singed my hair.
If you are late again next time, we are through!
Uh, sorry, wrong address
When he said "Marry me and I will pay all your student loans" she must have forgotten her old flame.
Oh its you again. Flowers will not do the trick; she just does not want to come out and play with you.
My husband is coming - quick, hide behind that bush.
The damsel does not date dragons anymore.
Should've brought the boom box.
The show's over.  You can go home now.
I told you, Game of Thrones is not doing a spin-off!
Pssst.  Keep it quiet.

  I can't let the others know I'm doing Green Dragon.
You are not the Prince, he never brought me flowers.
Instead of flowers, try mint, Dragon Breath.
Come around to the back door.
We appreciate the offer, but the princess drives a car.
Where's your Boom Box?
We’ve moved on.
You don't match your profile picture.
I am going to roast these flowers for you my fairest maiden
I may not be the dragon of your dreams, but I can take you around the world in 80 minutes
Wait, let me hide behind you!
I don't want our relationship to drag-on, Gormonthius...
I've told you a million times! I hate peonies!
Courting
You looked taller in your profile picture.
She's busy right now, but just wait and St.George will attend to you."
No, Jordan Peterson can’t come out to play.
Hi Tiny
Well, this is awkward.... All your pictures on Tinder were head shots.
Sorry, I don't date outside of my species.
Wrong address. Follow your tail
No, Hugo, it's just not possible. Your breath - I've asked you a hundred times to do something about it, but, no: not you. OK, Mr. Big Shot, this final: from now on, no more showing up with flowers. And don't skywrite me!
Your profile picture was captivating!
Did you say coal fired pozza?
Thanks, but I have allergies
You look nothing like your profile pic.
He's just not that into you.
As long as you promise to have her home by 10, she has school tomorrow.
For the last time, Game of Thrones isn't real. 
If I wanted to be reborn in fire, I'd have gone to witch college.
But I already told you:  the relatives will never understand.
I'm sorry, but you're breath is terrible.
Is that all that's left of your scorched-earth policy?
Can I please talk to John Snow
Sorry, you’re just not my flame of choice.
Flowers are not allowed but thanks anyway.
Ok I didn't ask for flowers....I asked for FIRE breathing!
The last I saw of her she was with the Night King.
Periwinkles, I’m allergic to periwinkles.
Just be patient, I'll let you eat the knight after a while.
I can’t...I’m grounded
His Highness appreciates the gesture, but assures you he shan’t acquire fire-breathing technology.
He said to give these to you.
Sorry, Godzilla doesn't live here any more.
Deliveries taller than 10 feet need to go to the siege gate around back
You light my fire!
Do you need a mint? Your breath is on fire.
Truly a damsel in distress.
Who did you say your father is again?
I know I said 'I love you' but that was before the war ended.
May I stay? Someone drained the swamp.
May I keep these flowers fresh in your moat while I blow your castle down?
Excuse me, is this HBO?
why are you ghosting me?
She says she forgives you and the flowers aren’t necessary.
David Fleischer, New York, NY
You never could follow directions!
I''m Puff and you must be Mary Jane. Now that you've been freed will you come fly with me?
Oh my God, I can't believe you are still alive!
Its for the Chinese new year's day.
I must ask my Father.
I’m sorry, the King isn’t buying it.
There ARE proper florists in the castle.
Sorry!  Now that Game of Thrones is over, she's moved on.
Yes I know it worked for Ferdinand the Bull but you don't even have an agent!
They're lovely but, I'm allergic to dandelion's.
I am sorry, Daenerys is not home.
No deli flowers -- get thee to a florist.
You must have the wrong castle the one you want is back the way you came from and has a sign saying all dragons welcomed!
I'm sorry. The finale was six weeks ago.
Would you come back tomorrow when the knight will be home?
George says 'he's very flattered but he's more of a damsel in distress kinda guy'.
I feel like you're ashamed of me. Why can't we ever play Dining Rooms and Dragons, where I finally meet your parents.
Art thou down to smashe?
Seriously, not going to trade the tip of my tail for some maiden´s hand.
The king is still awake, I'll have to sneak you in the back door.
Sir Dragon - Her Ladyship said "Flowers do please, but treasure persuades.'
What did you do with my wife?
Merlin thinks I should see other dragons.
Really, you’re sorry you burped and torched the whole village. How many tomes have I told you not to eat people who eat garlic!
I shouldn't--your last mom got a little carried away...
Um, you looked thinner in your picture.
Oh my! The online dating service had you listed as a fiery dragoon


David Covintree, New York, NY
I've already told you, "She's your MOTHER!!"
I'm not dragon my feet this time.
Hey,look - I'll huff and I'll puff until I blow this house down!  Now will you take these flowers?
Just give me a minute to write my ransom note.”
They were out of corsages.
She'll be ready in about ten minutes, would you like to wait in the parlor?
If your looking for little Lizzie... 
She lives in the cave... "down by the river"...
Is Jennifer in?
I said to meet me in the dungeon
I don't think the Princes ordered flowers.
It's Lancelot I'm here to see is he in?
Just wait a minute, I’ll get him.
I promise I'll have her home before 10.
Snapdragons, perchance?  Hardly an original idea.  On the other hand, this fair maiden can't be too choosy about her gentleman caller's social skills.
Did you eat him yet?
Sorry, I prefer a prince !
Gimme a break! I am sorry that I forgot the third flower! You know perfectly well this is not a joke!
I'm here to take Rhaegar to the prom, is he/she ready?
Fire insurance??
Chris? Chris from Bumb- Oh no. Oh god. Chris. We went on one OKCupid date in like 2013. I’m sorry, this has been a terrible mistake. And when I say “terrible mistake,” I mean you really suck. You sucked then and I bet you suck now
The Dinosaur of Avon calling
Shes gone West.
I know how this archetype ends.
Oh, my, I need to cut back to three times a week with Dr Thomas.
If I could turn baack tiiime...
I'll be out in a minute, I just need to make myself  more edible.
You’re just not really my phenotype.
frozenlFJJJJasas
No thanks. You ugly.
Shh. You'll wake the baby.
The prince wants to know if you’re open to a threesome?
It might be better if you came back later. St. George is visiting her right now.
Sorry, I f*#k birds now.
I simply prefer the courting of an Ogre.
I guess chivalry isn't dead although most of the castle knights are on account of your fire breathing.
Are those for me or a snack?
You are not who I expected either. Where’s Ben?
Dad wants barbecue.
I'm sorry they've gone to Montauk for the summer.
Mother of Dragons Day was last Sunday, sweetie.
oh yeah? well you don't look much like your picture either. also it didn't make me include my height so it's your fault for not asking. anyway, you want to eat me out now?
Drogon, No smoking in here.
Sorry, she’s gone out for an audition.
Not right now, my parents are home.
Won't you fly away with me?
For Chrissakes Randy, I said it was a one-time thing.
I'm sorry for your loss.
‘My, did Prince Charming really take such a circuitous route?’
Ive moved on, I'm not coming back to the tower.
Sorry we are under no Game of Thrones policy
Your mother wants you to take her to Kings Landing today.  It'll be a lot of fun!
Can you crawl over?
She won’t see you until you change direction.
And you think that a couple of flower pedals will get you a date with my daughter?
You look great, honey. Let me just grab my handkerchief and I’ll be right out.
That was a cigarette. I’m not a dragon.
Monday is Rapunzel's loose-ends day.
Excuse me, is Daenerys home?
Sorry.  We're busy today.  Come back next week.
So, you also lie on your Tinder profile, huh?"
Shhh quiet, or my dad will kill you
Sorry Daenerys died.
Well, the flowers are nice. But you did burn half my kingdom.
Shhhhh!! The baby is sleeping!
Don't tell dad you're trans
Tell Dany it’s too late for flowers...
Flowers make me distressed.
I expected more fire in our romance.
Uh, could you tell me a little about this prom thing?
Auditions are being held through the back door.
I'm so sorry, but it's your breath and I have stopped smoking.
The Heart wants what the Heart wants, and it doesn't want that tail anywhere near my baby-maker!
Don't get all fired up, but you're too late. The King of the North GOT here first so they're using the magic carpet as transportation
Please go. My parents would never approve. I've told you this.
Wow, not exactly what I imagined from his profile picture.
I hope you used your mouthwash today.
Come back when you have more flowers.
Your late.....
Come back when you've got roses...
Your online profile said you were 5’10”
Apologize all you want, the kingdom is still calling for a remake."
You're not George!!
She’s finishing her makeup. Just be a few hours.
I am here for the casting call for GOT Final Season Redux.
I told you to meet me at the back!
You don't look a thing like your Facebook pic.
I told you to wear a mask! Without one, the King will be able to identify you as my lover!
All of the knights agreed that I’m a better fit for you.
You're not the usual petunia guy.
I told you not to come during the day.
Lydia? ...It's Bob
Do you know when she'll be back?
M'lady can't join you today, she's still a bit singed from last time.
She only gets off at 7p.m. - are you OK waiting in the lobby?
Yes, I will. I love your GPS!
You looked a lot younger in your Facebook picture.
Drew Bridges Wake Forest, NC
Yes, the final season felt rushed to us, too.
Yeah, um, my car broke down. Is it cool if I use your phone?.
Me thinks thou art a tyrant
But you promised to bring a whole roasted pig! Dad has been looking forward to it all week!
Your not hot anymore , fly a way
For the last time - my name is not Daenerys!
My husband George wants a word with you first !!!
You’re not what I was expecting from the JDate photo.”
She’s really sorry to cancel, though. It’s just been SO fraught with battle and throne-robbing attempts around here lately.
Just because you only have one head now doesn't mean you're not two-faced.
Sorry you don't like peanut Snickers, but that's all I have.
Come in, come in. The Dungeon Master is waiting.
I've finished binge watching Stranger Things, let me hop in the shower and I'll be out in a second
Pssst. Come back at 9 pm. He'll be watching Game of Thrones...
Bugger off!!
Not until you get proper fire insurance!
I don't party!
Are you interested in an overnight special for suitors, big fella?
Your princess is in another castle
He's decided to give them a couple extra weeks to solve this crisis. After that you can incinerate the children.
I know what I heard. You said that I love to drag on and on.
Godzilla' s old news
We aren't the quickest, but I wouldn't say anyone here is draggin' .
Ditch the roast.
How sweet of you! Now buzz off.
Too soon, Drogon.
I'm sorry Smaug, your princess is in another castle.
Oh, no, not the front door. Meet me at the second turret.
Light your own fire, you are Late!
Sorry, sweetie, the princess only likes bad boys.
uh, okay, but are you actually a softboy? or are you a chad fronting like a softboy? because, i'll be honest with you, i'm not looking for anything more than a jackhammering
Go away; my father will not let me see you anymore!
I'm sorry, now that 'Game of Thrones' is over, I don't think we should see each other any more.
‘She wants a much bigger bouquet.”

Don Dechman
Austin, TX
Your friend just leapt out.
Fight for me, drogon
You're a lot taller in real life than you are in your profile. Men really be lying about their height all the damn time, huh?
Be patient.  He's taking a nap.
The auditions were last week, mate.
She is no longer here. My husband was going to slay her. She left even without a goodbye.
When they go high I go low!When they go high I go low!
Go away!  My husband came home early.  I’ll meet you at the cave tomorrow night.
Again, I’m so sorry Larry. My stepmother must have swiped right when I was out singing to some deer.
I told you only to stop by on Tuesday's as that's his day to pillage a town to the South!
Madame, you have a visitor.
Shhhhh!  HBO is sleeping.
Honey, once I get the door open you can use the bathroom.
"Can you be fifty shades of grey?"
Flower delivery!
His feet looked a lot smaller on his MedievalOnly profile.
Well you'll have to go through me to get to that knight.
The Beast says that you're no Beauty.
There’s No way this ends with “They lived happily ever after”
Could you come back later, I'm re-watching GoT?
I told you to come around back.
Is the doctor who provides services to monsters in?
Shhh, he's asleep!
No, Daenerys Targaryen does not live here.
Let's do Prince!  Prince,  prince bo bence, bo-na- na fanna fo fense,  fi fi fo mince.....oops.
Sorry, the knight is not in the mood to slay.
No, this is the 8th kingdom.
Mother of Dragons' Day was last week.
So G.O.T. is  over and you're looking for a new mistress?
You hoo. We're back without the horse.
The flowers are lovely, and I'll let him know you stopped by, but an invitation to "frolick in the autumn mist" just can't compete with Fortnite.
To be honest, ever since the flowers, I'm no longer comfortable having St. George sparring with you.
Drag your ass on in here before the Prince gets home!
Drag I said!  I could slip you in if you came in drag. Not dragon!
The Play.   What are you doing?  You are supposed to be the enemy.
all that breathing fire stuff, just fake news- i promise!
I had a great time, too...but I just can't get past your breath.
Are you familiar with The Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire? well...
Did you remember to bring the fire extinguisher?
The Black Knight is out with the boys. Come back later.
I thought everyone knew arrangements need to be in odd numbers. Two will never do...
Thanks but we’re all dragging here as it is so another won’t work.
I told you not to come around when m'lord was at home.
Shhhh, my dad might hear you.
Do you like fire dragons?
You know you are not wearing pants, and I can tell you are not very excited about the prospect of ravishing me.
Return during the night watch. Use the password "John Snow."
Doug? So it is you. I thought you were using a Snapchat filter on your photos.
He’s not my type
Will you accept this rose?
Hey, The show is over!!
It's better if we're long distance.
I requested Dragon flowers.
Oh, sorry, you must be looking for Drakaina Daria. She's further down the road.
You just missed your mother. She’s summering on the Casterly Rock.”
Is the Rampart Suite still available?
He's back from the Crusades,I'll get on touch later.
Can Daenerys come out and play?
Shhh, my parents are sleeping
Um, the flowers are nice, but she'd prefer a box of blue tips.
Sorry, I've got a phone call
M'Lady wants you to know that the flowers are very sweet but that love means never having to say 'Dracarys'.
Whooo is it?
It's not going to makeup for eating the my husband, the King.  Well, maybe a little because he was a real jerk.
She'll be right out she putting on her fireproof​ coat.
No sorry, she’s two castles down.
Before The Bachelorette refined their contestant criteria.
Her Majesty is allergic to pollens.
Come right in; those Prince Charmings are so boring.
I'm swiping left
But, I said you are not my type.
I am sorry, but it is not going to work. I cannot date Yankees’ fan!
Don't forget when we go out, I have a curfew back at the castle.
Ms. Targaryen is on vacation. Come back Wednesday.
Oh my,you don't look anything like your Tinder photo!
Psst! Get ready, the knight is expected to arrive in five minutes!
I can still get out of this.
I told you to wait down the street so my father wouldn't see you.
That's thoughtful of you . . . . but she only likes roses.
I don't mean to drag on about this, but won't you consider going out with me?
No Games for THIS throne, bud!
You’re nice, Kur, but I’m just not sure I want a life of scorching villages.
No matter how many flowers Daenerys sends, I won’t give up the Iron Throne.
We only vote for Democrats
No, this is #8 Moat Street.  #10 is next door.
I’m sorry, but she flew the coop...I mean castle, earlier today.
Is your daughter available?
Ooh! Give me 5 minutes. I haven’t told Dad about you yet.
Sorry, my husband is out right now.
It won't work between us, I don't even like daisies.
Those lovely flowers are going to make you sneeze fire, so kindly turn your head."
Why, hello! You look so different from your profile picture...Josh, was it? Well, do come in. I just made some ice tea and I just gotta put this laundry away." (man's voice) "Hi there. My name's Chris Hansen. Why don't you have a seat right there.
I'm sorry, but the princess no longer wants to speak with you."
Come around back so my father doesn't see you!
Sir, can you kindly untangle me?
I'm so sorry.  Please come back in 6 months when the abortion is confirmed.
Oh how sweet.   You brought me flowers.  But my Dad won't let me go out with you.
Junior misunderstood his parents when they suggested, he should, “meet a virgin”.
You lied about the weed AND the flame.
I know she's expecting me.  We met on Tinder.
Evidently, your Game of Thrones filming took longer than expected. You could have, at least, sent a text.
I just can’t forgive you for burning up our couple’s therapist when we were starting to make some progress.
You sure mess up a lot but at least you're serpentant.
And with a ring of fire, they wed.
Drogon reaches step 9.
Dragon who?"  "Dragon my feet too long. Will you marry me?
Did you forget the milk?
Not even flowers will bring Danny back to life, Drogon.
We have to stop meeting like this. You're promised to the prince.
Oh! You looked quite different in your photo!
For someone who can breathe fire and terrorize a country..I'm afraid a small bouquet of flowers is going to get you an audience with the Queen...
That’s not the pizza guy.
If you’re Puff, the magic dragon, can we go frolic in Honahlee?
I thought flowers made you sneeze fire
How do you feel about having children?
Well, you did say you were tall and an Old Style Guy on Match.
It seems their WIFI is off-line. They can’t seem to hear the door knocker.
Your profile said that you are a Game of Thrones fan
Tell them it'll run them another grand for breathing fire.
I'm sorry, the flowers won't help...I'm already getting kidnapped at 3...
I think I’ve been catfished!
Um, maybe we should go to your place-- quickly.
Since there is no need for a golden rope, I am downstairs.
Sorry, the Princess is not receiving today.
I'm sorry, she rode off into the sunset with the white knight yesterday.
You want Arpege or our page?
I bethought thou wast the bard in the center...
Linda, hurry!  We'll have to FLY to make the Pride Parade!
Oh, I love snapdragons!
You are too late. The princess has been awake for hours.”
Come back later, I'm not feeling horny right now.
Wow, you look exactly like your profile pic!
But you looked so much taller in your tinder profile picture.
Wish this was made out of cheese!
Flowers are nice, but we ordered pizza.
Now I’m confused—would you be the dragon, the dragon-slayer or the false hero?
You misunderstood...I just need a fire in the furnace.
I literally just heard that Daenerys died and you show up with flowers? Pretty low, Drogon.
I’m baaaaaaack!
I'm really sorry, Angela. Refugees are a nice addition.
Oh my! He won't be pulling my hair (coming up the wall) but I can do things with that tail!
Oh. So that's what happened to Juliet that's a shame.
Sorry--he's off on a slaying gig in China!
Come on in. Merlin concocted some mints, so I can kiss you now.....
Nothing is more guarded than a princess’s heart, except, maybe her ego.
Didn’t you hear? The show got canceled!
Oh wait let me turn off the alarm it’s dragon sensitive..
Not again.
Is it easier for a flying dragon to crawl through a narrow doorway or for Zmelda?
My parents say vaping is just as bad.
umm...you looked really different in your profile pic.
Not now, my husband is returning from battle.
I can't come out now.  My husband thinks we are just friends
How did you know those are my favorite flowers?
Flowers for our Dinner.
The writer said it's over.
Try the next castle over ?
But you'll only get the discount if I seat you as two…
The wings and tail were nowhere to be seen in that Tinder profile.
Give her a minute to change her dress. She just realized tarlatan’s flammable.
Give me a minute to freshen my makeup.  I was expecting Prince Charming, not Puff the Magic Dragon
The Princess is doing better, but she's still got 3rd burns from your last good-night kiss - I'd say give her another week or so...
Sorry, she’s binging Game of Thrones.
Poppy does them in 3D Prints now, yet welcome, we have a ball of a time watching you castle flash.
You don’t look at all like your Tinder picture.
Do you see my special diet request on my RSVP?
Well you don’t know if you don’t go.
Hello me lady, pardon me, i'm a bit old fashion, but would you like to join me for night out?
Shhhh!! You'll end up breaking his masculinity!
Her Majesty is allergic to peonies.
My parents are still up, climb in through the window.
I was expecting you. My other suitors have all called me the dragon lady.
She says you should stay in your lane.
I"m sorry, a shared phylum doesn't matter. It only works with frogs.
I dream of romance, and instead I get Daisies & Dragons childcare marketing.
Sorry your Mom’s not here! She went North.
Remind me, you’re NOT the one that turns into a pumpkin. Right?
But I thought I was gonna get to kill Cersei.
Hey, champ! What's blazin'?
Sir Malcolm is indisposed. Can you come back in a fortnight?
I think you're cute, but my Father would never accept it!
Thanks so much for bringing Daenerys back from the dead.  You may go now.
Sorry, the Prince doesn't live here anymore
Ok, you look NOTHING like your Tinder picture.
I told you before, I so do not want to be the next Khaleesi.
Did you really call me all afternoon? I did not see.
Nuh-uh! Not unless you pay dragon support and fire insurance!
Daenerys isn't feeling well today.
Go away; I don't care what Shirley may have told you.
NO, Danerys is not at home
But we send the EU £30bn a week!
I told you how I feel. Please don't let this drag on.
Sorry, it still doesn't make up for King's Landing.
Please stop torturing yourself. I just have a thing for frogs, and you'll always have dragon breath.
It's going to take a bit more than flowers to make up for that ending.
Sorry, she's not home... off filming season 8.
Just wanted to mention as you wait on your date that the next town over has some wonderful dining options.
"Yes, dear, the princess does have horrible dragon breath, but I think you're a tad bit confused on the literal meaning."
Rumplestiltskin will be right out; she's just letting her hair down.
And  i don't believe you!
Dream on without me, big boy. I'm back to my bacardis and bikini on a Bahama beach
She's been abused by the prince since the last battle. Please don't miss the fire this time!
The princess would like you to light the fireplaces before she sees you.
But I thought your profile said you LOVED dragon roll sushi.
mmeh! …   You better follow your arrow wherever it points
Stop dragon your ass and come in.
I’m afraid she’s out with Mario tonight.
Nice try, but something tells me we'll go further with fire than with flowers
Sorry you didn't see our tweet about our downsizing. Once you get right sized and come back, make sure you bring some decent flowers.
How the hell is that moat going to stop me? You've lowered the bridge!
Do you happen to have a paper bag?
Have you heard the good news?
I thought you were bringing the Mongolian Fire Pot
Follow your tail firebreath
You shouldn't be here....if the Prince gets back....
We appreciate the posies but this place isn't fit for a dragon.
Your not the “princess” I met hear last night!!
I told you to use the back door; the king can't know about us.
You just looked younger in your profile picture.
Sorry, but we don't have that many breath mints.
Come on in, but no fire breathing tonight!
A pizza date is ok, but no going to your cave for dessert.
It will never work out. You’re a fire-breather. I’m pro-choice. Please go.
I don't mean to lead you on, but I need you to know I'm waiting for Sir Lancelot.
The prince apologizes for misleading you.
Oh, I know, true love is not infatuated. It's a journey that begins with a lovely impression.
Where’d you take her Drogon?
I’m looking for the Paper Bag Princess
I told you already. Tuesdays I do my hair.
Sorry, I am not the Dater of Dragons.
Do you have my children locked up in there?
Game of Thrones is over.  Go back to the casting director.
Sorry no maidens available for grilling today
I know you're passionate, but if you don't stop flaming the carpets my husband will be suspicious
Judy doesn’t want to see you.
I'm so sorry, but my parents would never approve.  You're not my species.
Daenerys?
Yes, the flowers are a nice gesture but father insists you stop incinerating his rhododendrons.
Me thinks you have the wrong address....
You're charming and cute but just won't fit in."
Tell the queen it looks a little like a Trojan horse
You can kidnap me at eight.
I'm sorry , but ever since Game of  Thrones  ended she just doesn't want  to see you anymore.
I'm dealing with Game of Thrones withdrawal, too.
Daisies for Distress?
I've heard the song 'froggy went a courting', but this does seem a bit much.
The King says he does not want the princess to have a fly-by-night boy friend.
We know you're sorry, Carl, but Sir Knight's burns haven't quite healed.
The princess said your son is doing fine and you should be able to see him soon.
Come back when you find me a Venus flytrap.
She can't. She has to wash her hair.
My family once approved you, but that was just to sear the meat.
Drogon, we had a good run on Game of Thrones,
but now I have to move on.
Uh...if you kiss me, I'll turn into a prince...
You're too late. Rapunzel just left with someone else.
Those flowers are not going to convince Saint George that you are Puff the Magic Dragon.
She left to raze a village weeks ago. Don't you read The New Yorker?
The flowers are lovely, but the Queen was hoping for a somewhat grander gesture.
Bill, those flowers you're bringing may be causing hallucinations.____
Drake it was all a huge mistake. You don't even fit to come into the manor.
You know when you really like someone, and your stomach clenches, and you don't know if it's butterflies or you've eaten too much knights?
Wow, you’re a mythical creature.
Oh, you shouldn't have: FLAMED THE ENTIRE TOWN!!!!!!
No, I won't set you up with Sir Caresalot.
I'm almost ready... just let me make the King's dinner, proofread a few royal decrees, make sure that the Knight's aren't going into overtime and then we should be good to go!
She's not home right now, can I take a message?
Who trained you to love?
I'm sorry from head to tail."
Dragola isn't here. She just left with Sir Dragon Fire.
George isn't home, but I can tell you he's no saint dear."
You're done in the garden already? Great! Can you also take a look at the highest tower? I think some of the stones need to be repointed.
I am not a lesbian !
I'm sorry, the servant's entrance is in the mythical.
She’s hatching right now, sorry.
Oh no! Don't tell me...George is not coming!
Okay. But I'll neither be the candle nor the dinner.
Where did you get those flowers?
I'm sorry. My parents wont allow me to marry outside of my species
She went out with T REX.
I know I am Now, but what
I really want to do is Dance.
Friendly is friendly
.... Whaddaya mean "HOW friendly?
Where's George?
She can't see you now, she's having her skin scorched.
Roses for the Dragon Lady?
Ready in a minute!
Flowers, flying lessons ? breath mints should win her over.
Is Miss Mary at home?
You look different than in your profile
I appreciate the thought, but you'd be a drag on me.
Mating season! It must be the merry month of May
Go away! What could we possibly have in common.
I look forward to the day when we can afford something better than Ikea.
You'll have to come back next week.  I'm binge-watching Game of Thrones.
You have to understand! It’s over!No moreGame of Thrones for us.
Yes, you're at the right house! Come in through the back door.
Can I please purchase 1 senior ticket to ride on the dragon, unless you accept E ride tickets?
You were just trying to ask me on a date this whole time?
Wrong HBO set
You call that sorry? The flowers are OK, but you're not getting in until I see some Ferrero Rocher.
You don’t look anything like your Tinder profile.
Your picture was smaller on the dating app.
pssst! Get a job.
It said you were taller on your tinder profile...
Sorry, but I'm allergic to snapdragons.
Where have you been? ... guess dragon your feet again.
You looked different in your profile pic.
How about spending the flower money on some breath mints?
You can in, but burn we twice!
Aren't you supposed to be letting your hair down about now? JK Fuller. Genoa, nv
You're just on time to light the candles on the cake!
No,  I'm not your mother. Your mother is dead. Please find another TV Show to work on.
Wait- aren't you the guy who killed my family?

Shit...
My GPS shows the other way to our anniversary dinner.
Godzilla brought two dozen red roses!
Take these breath mints and go woo the queen.
Sorry, the dragonslayers moved  out last week.  Their daughter moved to Fire island.
George is finishing his hair and then he’ll be ready to go.
Mother is right, you're a brute! Don't you know I'm allergic to peonies?!
I didn’t mean to burn you like that..
I'll meet you out back!
I told you to stop coming around.  I'm dating George now.
guards guards there's a dragon outside holding flowers I might get an allergic reaction
I am sorry, Sparky. But, there is just no room in my heart for a creature that can so ruthlessly destroy native wildflowers!
I was wondering if thou wouldst ever have enough courage to speak for thyself, John!
I already told you, Sneezy--not during allergy season!
I just don't think my feelings for you are real.
You're sweet, but I'm really not captivated by you.
All of a sudden "The King'" thinks he's full of fire and a winged warrior.  Give me a sec and our flight plan to the Cave will be back on track.
Gee, I hope she’s not another Prince Charming rebound.
Come back later, I’m watching the final episode of “Game of Thrones!”
There’s literally not room for you at the banquet, flowers or not
She won't consider anything less than a dozen red roses.
This cartoon sucks.
Is Saint George home?
Bad Dragon!  What did you do with the prince?
My Lips are Sealed
She is not here. she is out with King Kong right now
Sorry, Game of Thrones is over and so are we.
So when should I come back?
Psst! Give me twenty minutes to get rid of Sir Defender-of-the-Patriarchy.
You are a sweetie! Flowers!!
I’m looking for someone who it’s safe to have whisper sweet nothings in my ear.
I’ll be a minute, I have to do my hair.
I thought a dragon could try a less controversial way of conquering a  human female.
You've got the wrong castle- the Kensingtons live down the street.
Bell flowers for the Bell tower.
See, I’m a nice guy
I'm sorry Puff, but Jackie Paper doesn't live here anymore.
Number one, you're not my type, and number two, I don't shop at department stores"
Come back later, I'm down in the dungeon!
Do you mind me changing into a dragon scale dress tonight?  This wool one is too hot for your lair.
Have you not heard about Khaleesi?
I'm Ollie. We met on the internet.
For the last time, Reggie, the princess broke up with you!
Oh my God!  What happened to Sir Wellington?
Forget it, I know you still have a thing for that white-haired girl.
Ouch, wow, sorry! Long story: went kind of crazy, burned up a lot of people, got stabbed. Anyway, not here at the moment.
You are pretty scaly!
The series is over, including CGI. You were great. You can pick up your things at the warehouse. You'll be remembered by DVD. Love you!
Give me a couple minutes to freshen up
Leave them by the moat, and remember me to Godzilla.
I’m sorry, you’ll have to use the back entrance.
I think we should start eating different people.
Even your tail is telling you to get out of here.
She doesn't live here anymore. Go away!
Queen Daenerys would welcome you as a dragon, but the thought of another suitor gives her a stabbing pain.
How many times do I have to tell you?  My name is NOT Algernon.
Gorn, you breathe fire into my heart!
OK, but not until you bring my sister back.
I’m flattered, really I am, but I’m pretty serious with the chimera right now.
I'm sorry, Puff. You just don't fit into my life anymore.
Romeo,you've GOT to stop showing up unannounced.
Someone said Mary lived here and that she's a dinosaur.
Wrong address. Daenerys Stormborn lives in the castle around the corner.
No I can’t tonight. The Game of Thrones marathon is on.
Mother's day is next week
Can you hear me okay, Mom? Just saying, everything seemed fine till I saw his forked tail.
She's not back from filming Game of Thrones.
Not now - the king is in residence!
Sorry, Dumbo, I don’t think Uber is your future.
. . . - - - . . .
This is the wrong day. My prince in shining armor is here.
I instructed you to send PETE!
Gaah, that is not at all how I imagined you, M'lady. You are ugly!
Oh, this is awkward . . . . I was actually hoping to speak to
Prince Charming.
This is the signal.  My parents are out. Come on in and we'll play.
But for me only a bouquet of baby's breath can breath fire.
Sorry, the laws of evolution bar creatures with legs, arms, and wings.
If only you  were a few million years older..."
Viserion isn't that kind of dragon.
I'm sorry.  My lizard is washing her hair
She's dead.
Ash-cleft, last night was a mistake, mother will only allow me to date Dragoons!
I know it's not your fault that you are so big and mean looking, but still.
Terribly sorry, but the prophecy said “his wife,” not “his wyvern.”
I can take a message and give it to a crow.
I know your type—just another gentleman caller freshly sprung from his bachelor cave hoping to pitch the woo with a wilted posey. Fie on you!
Don't breathe, the place still needs fireproofing.
Is that you, Ted? How are you controlling that thing? You do know I said I wanted a 'dragon dildo' and not a 'dragon date' right?
Sorry, you'll have to use the Service entrance...
Shh...my husband's starting to suspect we're meeting.
My father's name?  You can just call him Mr. Dracarys.
Where will you kids be going tonight?
Roll a persuasion check.
Sorry Ferdinand, I know you mean well but I don't date dragons.  You're family could never accept us!
Gerald please, a lovely prince just stopped by!
Ma’am in my culture that gesture is an act of aggression.
We are cleaning the grounds, come back later.
Please wait until we build a bigger door!!
My dad says I cannot see you anymore...
Meh -No dragon energy
I'm draggin' tonight...could we reschedule?...
Sorry
M'lady said that you are really sweet and that she REALLY had a nice time but , er, you are just not her type "
Do you have dragon breath in the morning?
I won't treat you like my last city.
You're early, Jeffrey - Beatrice is still in the shower!
Sorry, no peddlers.
She will be out in a minute she's looking for her incombustible dress.
She’s been burned to many times.
I'll be ready in a Snapdragon.
Flowers won’t fix King’s Landing, Drogon. I think you should leave.
It wasn’t a “Game” of Thrones to me.
Is the Dragon Queen home?
Hi there!You ordered an extra large penis? My tail is actually my penis. May I come in?
What, I said game of Thrones, not game of thongs !
The Lady wants some venison by Friday.
We have to be discreet or my fiancé’s gonna slay you!
The series is over.
Sweetie, let’s follow my tail trail.
Oh!  Puff from Nigeria.  Please come in!
She won’t see you. It’s your dragon breathe!
Please come around to the loading dock behind the moat. Think you will fit in easier.
I'm looking for Donkey.
No, there are no auditions for Game of Thrones.
I heard  there is someone here named Rapunzel. Is this is the right address?
It's not my fault you're too overweight to fly over the wall.
But I've had this job for 9 seasons, you can't throw me out. What do I do now?
Feeling cute, might kill people later
No, you cannot see the princess.  She already told you that she did not appreciate you burning some villagers to impress her.
Quick, step inside before someone notices.  And BTW, I'm allergic to flowers.
You have bad manners. If it is love then don’t use white flowers. You’re domesticated.
Shh meet me around top.
I am sooooo sorry but we our fire protection inspector has denied  you admittance!
But everyone kept telling me that you would be a frog?
Don’t worry, my Mom loves flowers.
You must leave. My father ordered I’m too young to date and if you come back here again, he’s going to get his flame thrower.
Hannah B., will you accept this rose?
Flowers for moi?
Antirrhinums? Oh Smokey you shouldn’t have...”
Haven't you heard , Game of Thrones ended?
Oh, my...I just accepted your cousin Oscar!
I don't need any more sources for my ever-growing disappointment in humanity
Keenly I prayed for a dark, sweet D.  Today doth answer my prayer twice over.
Flower, check. Fire, check. Hold on ... I gotta get my pipe.
I am the best suitor and have many strong points.
Maybe if you can fix that breath? Burning my eyebrows off is getting old.
Baby, I’m telling you, your mother has me pegged all wrong!
Are there any more flowers around back?
My Dad got home early from tax collecting so we have to spend like 5 minutes with the Rents before we go out, no weird dragon fire breathing okay?
The princess said: it’s not you, it’s me. She.
I'm sorry but you have completely misjudged me
Forget the flowers. Try a case of breath mints.
Ok.  We can make this trap work for us.
I was wrong, go back to the fiery nostrils."
I told you before, I don't like Fireweed
Wait for me here.  My father can be a real knight.
Your dragonlady left the CASTLE. She's heading for the white HOUSE.
I'm sorry. I've got some bad news about Daenerys.
No ... I liked you better as a fire-breather!
She said she will be down in a moment but please, no barbeque restaurants this time.
I've already told you, Drogon, flowers are not going to make up for burning down the entire city of King's Landing!
It'll never work out between us--you'll never fit through this door.
You're not a dragon...
Oh, when we matched I thought you had missed a 0 in 5 ft height.
Would you come for dinner at my place? My specialty is charred.
Does your mother know you’re here?
I thought I told you to meet me in the back.
I'm sorry ... she's not quite ready.
Dragoon!   oo!  Dragoon!
Oh Hello.  I'm sorry, but Puff'no longer does magic.
oh, thank god, you won.
Flowers because you put up with the fire breath, dear"
I’m sorry, but Janice is allergic to flowers.
There's no actual Tinder here.
We are going to have to high tail it if we are going to make it on time!
Flowers won't offset your making my family's picnic the toast of the town.
Come back later dear. It's that time of the month.
Your mother is out to pick up groceries.
But damsel, you look so ravishing in dis dress.
Thank you for applying. But we are looking for a rockstar dragon that takes no prisoners and responds to trumpet blasts seven days a week.
But I promised Prince Charming I'll go to the prom with him.
Arranged or not, I'm going to ravage your castle.
Oh, honey, my father won’t  let me see you anymore.
Mother warned me to beware dragons gifting daffodils!
Sorry, she's up in the Tower and won't come down
Would you be my Tinder date?
So early? I still have to put my drag on!
Sorry, I already said yes to Leviathan.
She hasn't finished Dungeons yet.
And her majesty sighed about chivalry being extinct.
She has a sore throat.
I'm no Daenerys Targaryen, but I am Mother of Rugrats,
Breaker of  Dishes, and Stubborn.....!
I guess I shall have to climb over or I shall get stuck!
Go away!  I've had it with you dragons.
We don't need you now
The time it takes for Putin to fill our castle again will Dragon
Why didn't you ask her out the 20 years she was locked up beside you?
Dad's dead set against it.
You don't look at all like your pictures on Tynder.
Yeah right, not falling for that one. No one likes carnations anymore.
Unfortunately for us, it's the castle down the road that has the king formerly known as Prince.
No, there's no Daenerys at this address, so beat it!
We're talking gold, right? You're not one of those gross hoarders?
Saint George has asked me to make it very clear to you, that if you should continue to come around here harassing his little sister, you are going to pay a very steep price for that behavior!
Sure, next Friday.  And, oh, I'm allergic to pansies.  So, hot chocolate or lightly toasted marshmellows, those work.
Breath mint.  Then I'll think about it.
Are YOU the dragon lady???
Want a Puff?
Your invitation specified a dragon killer. I was presuming you'd be a different species.
Sorry I prefer guys with loftier towers.
The coast is clear!
oh-hi there. I can't come out to play today
Sir Darius said he appreciates the sportsmanship but it's still too soon after his defeat.
Is this why you’ve been so possessive of me?
It's your breath.
Don't bother with the flowers, her highness asked could you please just send her a picture of your penis?
I'm sorry.  Not with breath like yours.
You may come in, but you'll have to use the back door.
You don’t look anything like your picture on my dating app.
It's only been a month since Daenerys died. I think I'm just a rebound thing.
Leave me alone or I will call your mother, Daenerys.
Forsooth, she hath been vanquished years ago.
Hi!  Can I take you for dinner?
This is a seriously messed up blind date.
I’m sorry, she cannot come out. Her energy is draggin’.
Go away! That's the oldest trick in the book.
The blond girl is dead
Karen I miss you, please come back to the cave
The flame in my heart still burns m’lady, but there’s been a wall between us lately.
If I let  you in, you have to promise we’re not going to spend the night watching reruns of Game of Thrones.
She told me to tell you that you're not her type--And she doesn't like daisies!  So Shoo!  Go back from where you came from--You, you overgrown Hollywood monster!
Until King Arthur gets over the letdown of the finale or
George R. R. Martin finally writes another book, I think you should make yourself scarce.
Please Be quiet, and come around to the back door
Soups on.
You don't look like your profile picture either.
I said "I saw a dragon" not "I'd see a dragon"
Did you ring?
For the last time, King George is not interested!
What's up? The last kiss, you were a frog.
I’m sorry, Rapunzel is washing her hair tonight.
Hurry...he won't be home till 6.
Get some drag on!
I'm sorry, but the princess is now betrothed to St. George.
She said she'll be down as soon as her metamorphosis
is complete...and she finds her lizard bag.
Yoo Hoo?
A pox on thee, and be damned. Thy breath would melt my chastity belt.
They're very nice, but a girl likes a little spontaneity, you know.
The princess is out for the evening, but I’m free after midnight Your Handsomeness.
Careful. It may not be what it appears to be.
Thank you, Drogon. But our queen is in another castle!
Sorry the princess is in another castle.
You’re just not that hot.
I'm sorry Elmo, but Daddy says
you have no future.
Don’t forget chocolate.
Frog prince didn't I warn you about eating those strange flowers?
I said guard the tower, not get me flowers.
Next time listen more closely when I say "The car is in the parking lot"
There’s a wall for a reason.
Your cold-blooded devotion and fire-breathing passion move me so. But alas, Father has chosen a suitor named Jared.
For the last time, fly in the direction of your tail.
You can't keep a lady waiting forever, you know.
Sorry! We're not interested!
Oh, I don’t know. Mother says I should make good choices.
f
I might be the fair maiden, but you can do better than that.
I know we were at my parents for a bar b q but they really didn’t appreciate you trying to help with the fire breathing
Look, I know it's been a great 16 years, but I've been... rescued. Tell you what, come back in 9 months and you will be at the top of the list for my daughter. Truly, you've been great! You really served the kingdom well. It's not you, it's me.
I'm sorry but Lady Gaga is waiting for Bradley to call.
Jeez week, I am sorry but I cannot accept the flowers as your tail is too sharp for me to open the door any further. Even though you’re sitting I still don’t feel safe enough.

Too bad cause the flowers are pretty but not you.
I'm sorry, but your girlfriend who previously held this castle was evicted (and killed) at the end of last month.
I told you, you make me feel trapped!
You look nothing like your Tinder photo” 

Savannah Fletcher, Los Angeles
Did I forget to mention the drawbridge? I hope it didn't fall on your tail.
This is a late entrant for the 6-23 deadline for the cartoon showing  mice:  “Damn IKEA furniture.”
Listen, being thoughtful isn't going to cut it. I told you no visitors allowed during fire drills.
Rex, my husband is home, please come back in an hour.
I don't give two shits what David Icke wrote. Anyway, she's in Balmoral.
Lancelot? No, but I lance a little. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must feed the royal aardvark. Burp! I'm Guinevere!
I'm sorry, I'm no longer interested in dragons after I seen the end of Game of Thrones.

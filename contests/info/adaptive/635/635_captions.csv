I don't normally date Middle-Aged men.
I wrote "middle aged."
You could have been clearer when you said you were Middle-Aged.
You didn’t mention you wear glasses.
I said I was Middle Aged.
I don't usually date middle aged men.
This is not what I expected when you said you were middle aged.
I meant middle-aged.
Laundry day?
Younger men haven't panned out, so I’m trying the Middle Ages.
I've got to use the bathroom, I'll be back in about 45 minutes.
Is that your sword touching my leg?
I imagined something different when you said you were Middle-Aged.
It's not easy for Middle Aged men these days.
We need to talk about the other knight.
It’s not ye, it’s me
People call me Lance. A lot.
They gave us a round table.  Happy now?
Surely you joust.
No, my profile says I’m looking for a middle-aged man, not a Middle Age man.
Your profile said middle aged not middle ages.
So, when are you from?
To be honest, I come with a bit of history.
I'm sensing you believe these are dangerous times for men.
I’m not wearing any under armour.
When you said you were middle aged, I pictured something a little different.
...it's just, your profile didn't mention you wear glasses.
I don't do one knight stands.
So your profile said you were "middle aged"...
Can you open that thing yourself or should I step on your foot?
And you’re no Guinevere, so let’s call it even.
You didn’t mention you were middle aged on your profile
I take it that you've been hurt before.
So tell me, how do you know Arthur?
First date since the divorce?
I see you remembered to bring protection.
Well you weren't wearing glasses in your profile either.
Why does everything have to be a crusade with you?
My profile CLEARLY stated I was Middle-Aged....
I guess my dating profile should have disclosed I was Middle Age.
Your ad clearly read:  “Must be middle aged, chivalrous, and wear protection.”
Well, you were honest about being middle-aged.
This isn't what I had in mind when your profile said that you were middle- aged.
I must have misread “middle aged.”
Classy restaurant, busy dinner hour, fine wine, suit of armor.  You're breaking up with me, aren't you
You did say you were middle-aged.
A dating profile that says ‘Early middle-age’ is a little misleading, don’t you think?
I think it's time we saw people from our own age.
I think there’s been a mistake — my profile said I was looking for someone Middle-Aged.
My ex-wife says I have intimacy issues.
Why is it always a fight with you?
Yeah, well you're not my vision of a princess either.
No, I don't do one-knight stands.
Now I understand why you insisted on a round table.
You seem a little defensive.
Fine. Chivalry's not dead. You still look like an idiot.
Sorry, I haven't been on a date in a while. I'm a little rusty.
This better not be another one knight stand.
You weren't wearing glasses in your profile picture.
Mom said there’d be knights like this
I'm not disappointed, I was just hoping you would be more of a renaissance man.
Shirley, you joust.
OK.  So they found us a round table.  Are you happy now?
I like star gazing from the turret, moonlit walks along the moat, and beheadings.  How about you?
Christ Steven, it was just an honorary knighthood.
I see you wear protection
So you always wear protection?
So, ‘looking for a fun knight’ was a typo, then.
I usually don't date Middle Ages men.
When I asked if you wore protection, I had something else in mind.
Oh, I like long walks on the beach, reading good books, and disemboweling and beheading Huns. You?
Well, I'm sort of between quests at the moment...
I guess writing “likes heavy metal” on my profile may have sent the wrong message
It's been a while since I've been on a date.  I'm a little rusty.
What time do you have to be back to the museum?
I have to use the restroom. I’ll be back in a couple of hours.
Yes, I can see your irony.
I dub thee Sir Not Gonna Have a Second Date.
Well, I did say I was looking for someone middle-aged.
Well, for one thing, you come across as a little defensive.
Well, I’m actually just a squire right now, but they say to dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
It'll never work...I'm a morning person and you're a knight.
Happy now? They seated us at the Round Table.
When I said to bring protection, this wasn't what I had in mind.
To tell you the truth, I was looking for "amour".
Now I see why you reserved a round table.
What part of "renaissance man" was misleading?
Well, you're no Guinevere either.
Yeah, I've been a little guarded since the breakup.
Well you're not what I pictured either, Guinevere.
Can't you just wear a lobster bib like everyone else?
Don't raise your visor but your ex just walked in.
Okay...not exactly what I meant when I said "Bring protection."
Chivalrous, outdoorsy, likes horses... Okay, I think I walked into this one.
Oh, I thought your profile said Middle Aged.
So that's what you meant by "attractive Middle-Aged man."
Your profile said you were into heavy metal.
You okay with spaghetti?
I like to think of myself as middle aged.
You need to open up.
I guess I did ask for a middle aged man
No I said 'medieval life crisis'
I do appreciate a man who uses protection.
Are you mostly free-lancing these days?
Well yes, l did write middle age on my profile.
I don't know.  I just feel like you have some barriers.
My mother cancelled...you can take that off now.
I don't think anyone has recognized you, Mr. Pence.
Those steel tariffs must be killing you
It's laundry day.
When I asked you to  wear  protection, this isn't what I had in mind.
When I said wear a suit and bring protection tonight, this isn't what I meant.
It's a really scary time for men.
Honestly Harold, if you hadn’t slain the maitre d’ maybe we’d have our appetizers by now.
You told me to wear protection.
So, we got the round table. Happy now?
I don’t usually do one knight stands.
Mother said there’d be knights like this
Sorry, but you are the worst knight of my life.
So how do you know Arthur?
Your dating profile did say "Enjoying Middle Age," 
but I interpreted it differently.
That's not what I had in mind when I suggested you wear protection tonight...
Trust me, no one noticed you had red wine with the fish.
To be fair, my profile did say I was middle-aged.
In my defense, my profile said I was middle aged.
I really thought 'middle-ages-meetup.com meant something else.
Issues with intimacy? No, why?
I'm not opposed to a one knight stand....
The dragon is free-range.”
It's just that you looked younger on your tapestry.
This explains the horse in the parking lot.
I thought you might prefer the round table over a booth.
That is not what I meant when I said you need to wear protection tonight
I think you read the ad wrong. I said middle aged.
Well, you don’t look much like your picture either.
Sometimes I feel we're centuries apart.
At least tell me if you are a man or a woman.
Can you shut up, Scott? I had a really long day and was hoping for a quiet knight.
Would you excuse me for two hours while I visit the men's room?
My pronoun is sir.
No, I don't want to see your lance a lot.  In fact, I don't want to see it at all.
No, Bob, it's not called a Middle Ages crisis.
You weren't wearing glasses in your profile pic...
Really? Now she's living with the dragon?
Do I mind being called Lance? A lot.
Let me guess, you've been hurt before.
I'm sorry you're disappointed but I did say in my profile that i'm a Middle-Aged man.
...you just seem a bit guarded.
You didn't tell me you were into heavy metal.
I get the sense that you don't often let your guard down.
Why yes, I did request a round table.
Actually, I'm not wearing anything underneath.
I’m sensing that you’ve been hurt in past relationships.
I always wear protection.
I don’t think I can deal with your Middle Ages crisis.
Geez Henry; it was a metaphor.
I don’t know. Everything you say sounds so hollow.
It takes me a while to open up.
You all claim I'm what you're looking for, but when I show up, you think I'm weird...
It took her several hours to realize that he had left the restaurant while she was in the bathroom.
I'm not into one knight stands
If you think slaying a dragon is tough, try raising 3 kids as a single parent.
We should talk about the other knight.
You should know...I’ve been hurt before.
Had to ask for the round table?
I'm not wearing a chastity belt while you're off with the boys on one of your crusades.
No, I’m not saying your profile was dishonest. We just have different definitions of heavy metal.
So you find the Holy Grail. Then what?
Jenny didn't tell me you wear glasses.
So, ever had a one knight stand?
I like you Lance, a lot
When you said you were a little rusty I thought you meant at dating.
I feel like you never let your guard down when you're with me...
Sorry, I don't do one-Knight stands.
Did you say one knight stand  ?
I just think I’m looking for someone less guarded.
So tell me, how long does it take for you to go through airport security?
They say a hard man is good to find.
I only pillaged. I promise.
Well, you're an improvement on the last guy. He was a real Neanderthal.
I always wear protection on a first date.
You seem unusually guarded tonight
Yes, I know I wrote looking for middle aged man.
'Well, his profile did say middle age.'
I don't see why you have to be so defensive.
...That better be your lance
Look, I just feel like you’re stuck in the past.
I'm in Witness Protection.
I can see you've been hurt before.
Have you ever dated someone middle-aged?
I wasn't sure what to wear either.
So, your profile said you’re into heavy metal?
It takes awhile for me to open up.
When I read your bio I thought middle ages was a typo.
Yea, well you’re no “damsel in distress” either !
Well you don't look like your profile photo either.
This is my first date in a long time, sorry if I'm a bit rusty
Have you thought of NOT telling everyone you voted for Trump?
But your posting specifically said "middle aged man"
You, on the other hand, look just like your picture.
No, I've never had a one Knight stand!
Was it too presumptuous of me to wear protection on a first date?
Let me guess, you have trouble opening up to people.
I'll open up soon. It's been a while, I'm a little rusty.
So I said to myself, "Mike, go out and meet people. Quit living in the past."
I thought you meant you were taking classes at "night" school.
I never open up on the first date.
I don't know. You just seem guarded.
Exactly how errant are you?
Yeah, a lot of women say they want a knight in shining armor, until they actually meet one.
When I said you'd have to wear protection........
Yeah, well, you don't look like your profile picture either
You've been looking for a fight since we left the house.
I am sorry, but that outfit makes you look middle aged.
I get that it's a Middle Age dating site.
It’s been a while since I’ve dated, so I’m a little rusty.
I see you've been updated on our new sexual harassment policy.
I promise you a knight you'll never forget.
Are you ready for the best knight of your life?
Damn autocorrect - I wanted a romantic 'night' out.
After the divorce, she took the castle.
Your Tinder profile said you were middle-aged, not Middle Ages.
You want to make England great again too?
It usually takes more than one drink for me to open up.
You’ll have to excuse me; it’s been awhile since I’ve dated and I’m a little rusty.
Yeah? Well, you're no Lady Guinevere.
Don't you think you are drawing unwanted attention to yourself with that plume?
Honey, when I said, 'Bring protection...'
It's been a while since I've dated and I'm a bit rusty.
I’m interested in more than a one knight stand.
I’m afraid of getting hurt again.
So this is why you insisted on a round table.
You could just get the flu shot!
I’m not really into one knight stands
I don't believe in one-knight stands.
Stop with the footsie--it hurts!,
Vice President Pence's first date.
You appear defensive, Arthur
Underneath? I go commando.
When you said you were going to night school, I guess I just assumed.
Guinevere this, Guinevere that—you’re still not over your ex.
No, but what does bother me is you ordered spaghetti.
No, Arthur, I don’t think it’s a coincidence we got a round table.
I do have to let you know, I have rust issues.
Nice look...Lancelot.  I said, 'dress for amour'.
Now I get why you reserved the round table.
I hear it's a scary time to be a man.
I guess it _is_ a very scary time for men in America.
I can’t say I really have a “favorite” Crusade.
Well, I'm in between quests right now.
I'll be fine, mom.  I'm not going to turn down the opportunity to clerk for Justice Kavanaugh.
You seem guarded tonight.
Do you come-here-a-lot?
I reserved the round table just like you wanted.
Well, I did say in my profile that I'm middle-aged.
My mother told me there would be knights like this.
What makes you think I'm intimidated by women?
I can't seem to reach my wallet...
Okay, I'm ready to talk politics.
My profile was very clear.  I 'm looking for amour, not armor.
Honestly, I'm more attracted to you with the visor down.
Let's be clear I am not intersted in a one knight stand.
Let me be clear. I’m not interested in any one-knight stands
Sure I’ve been hurt. Why do you ask?
My ad clearly said “Middle Ages man seeking companion”.  It’s not my fault you thought it was a typo.
That's not exactly what I had in mind when I asked if you'd wear protection.
I am guessing you don't look much like your photo.
I'm not really interested in just a one knight stand.
I'm sorry, I'm just not into one knight stands.
I said I wanted a memorable NIGHT.
Don't worry, I have protection.
At least we're both Middle Age.
I guess mother was right - be careful what you wish for.
I see you’ve met my ex.
Fifty years later Sophie fondly remembered the wine but couldn't recall what knight it was.
Growing up in the Rust Belt must have been pretty traumatic for you.
This isn't what I meant when I asked if you used "protection"
I have trouble opening up to women.
I like the knight life. I like to boogie.
You never like what I wear, Mother.
Now I understand why you capitalized “Middle Aged” man in your profile.
I'm a little rusty too. But I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing.
You’re not what I expected when I asked to meet a damsel in distress either.
What makes you think I'm being defensive?
I have no interest in a one knight stand.
I'm looking for someone a little less guarded
And how am I supposed to explain to your father that you've been diagnosed with late-onset, non-specific, trans-historical identity disorder?
Well, you don't look much like your profile picture either.
I thought after this we could slip into something more comfortable.
And I thought ‘a knight on the town’ was just a typo.
No, I said I was looking for amour.
I clearly wrote I wanted a night of amour.
I can fight my own battles now, mom.
If you want this relationship to go anywhere, you’re going to have to open up.
It’s a scary time for men.
I've had better knights
You told me to bring protection, didn’t you?
To be honest, this is the first time I date a middle aged man.
yes, I have been hurt before
I haven't been on a date in ages.
So tell me, Rusty, how did you get your name?
You looked shinier online.
Look,you have your crusade and I have mine.
I was hoping after a few drinks you’d let your guard down.
Actually, what I think I said was a "quiet NIGHT"
So...where do you keep your cell phone?
But, hey, listen, enough about me already! What do you do?
Stop pouting, Martha. You're the one who asked for a knight on the town.
No, it said 'seeking middle AGED man with attention to detail.
It's been a few ages since my last date.
So here I am again,dating another Middle Age man
I feel like I'm the only one being vulnerable right now.
Knight school? How interesting.
I have never even considered a one knight stand, but...
Just so you know, I always use protection on the first date.
I see you use protection...
You strike me as the kind of guy who never lets his guard down.
Sorry, I just came from knight school.
Middle-aged men", were your words exactly
You seem somewhat defensive.
I'm surprised they let you in without a tie.
I just don't think we are well-suited for each other.
It’s just that I’ve been hurt in the past.
You could just get a flu shot ya know.
All my prior boyfriends were into heavy metal
You're right. It does have a metallic taste.
Well, I'm not exactly 30, but you're not exactly shining.
It takes some time for me to open up...
You asked me to use protection.
It's a scary time to be a man in America.
I guess you could say I'm still feeling pretty guarded after my last relationship.
Must we always sit at the round table?
What do you mean?  My profile clearly stated I was middle-aged.
I’m a little nervous. I haven’t dated in ages.
I admit I'm a bit guarded.
So, you're currently freelance?
I thought you'd be happy I gave up that dumb Civil War reenactment hobby.
You've got mail.
I think I misunderstood you when you asked me to wear protection.
Will you excuse me for the next 2 hours? I need to use the restroom.
Just to be clear, I said I wanted more "amor".
That's not what I meant by "protection."
Well, you don't look like your picture either.
As you can see, I use protection.
I was hoping for more than a one knight stand.
It's not what they mean when they say wear protection.
So, you came straight from work?
You seem a little guarded tonight.
It's just a really scary time for men right now.
No.  I wrote, " I like a good wine and a quiet n-i-g-h-t.
I 'm sorry, I'm no longer into one knight stands
You’re right. I’m cold, hard and impenetrable. But I can change.
It seems you’re just looking for a fight.
I understand now why you asked for a round table!
I guess there is no need to ask if you brought protection.
It's not you, I just have trouble letting my guard down.
When I read you were in night school, something different came to mind.
It's not you.  It's your horse.
Sorry, I didn't have time to change.
Date Knight.
Mama never said there'd be knights like this.
It’s our fourth date, Harvey, but you still seem very defensive.
You're the first person I've met on this site that looks exactly like their photo!
Sure. You can call me 'Fair Maiden' if I can call you 'Sir Sleeps Alone'.
Is that your lance under the table or are you just happy to see me?
I misunderstood.  I thought you worked nights.
We could have just established a safe word
I specifically requested the Round Table.
Actually, my ad said amour.
This isn't going to work. You're looking for a damsel in distress and I'm looking for man who isn't stuck in the dark ages.
Oh yeah? Try wearing a chastity belt!
So, I understand you've been hurt before.
You’re awfully guarded.
I came straight from work
Will this be a one knight stand?
Women say I seem guarded.
That’s funny. I also carry mace.
My friends call me Rusty.
My dating skills are a little rusty
Actually, your armor isn't the only thing that's dull.
It's a very scary time for young men in America.
I consider myself a bit of a renaissance man.
My kingdom for a straw!
Quit the footsies.  It hurts.
Not the round table you were expecting, I suppose.
You are aware it's just a metaphor, aren't you?
I said I was looking for AMOUR, not ... oh, forget it
What, this old thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling any alchemy between us.
I think "DateKnight.com" was pretty self-explanatory
He had described himself in his profile as a "chivalrous, outdoorsy, Middle Aged man," but somehow she still felt mislead.
You look sharp, Stanley but I'm not looking for a one knight stand.
You’re one to talk—your blazer and hairstyle are right out of the 1980s.
Your ad said you liked heavy-metal
Sorry, but I'm past my one-knight-stand days.
Trust me: the way this date is going, you didn't need to bring protection.
I know your wife isn’t here, but this is ridiculous, Mr. Vice President.
It's just that everything you say sounds like a canned response.
I said amore not armor!
You're just too guarded...
You seem guarded.
I enjoy verbal jousting as well.
I've also been hurt before.
You’re going to have to let your guard down a little.
Let me guess. You're sensitive on the inside?
I rarely get a knight out.
Sure, your place, if you have a wrench.
When your profile said you were into heavy metal I thought it meant  hard rock.
I’m kinda rusty at this too.
Why don't you just get a flu shot already?
Well, yes, I have been told I’m a little guarded.
I know I said I preferred a quiet knight with a glass of red...
That’s not my lance.
Well, you don't look anything like your Tinder photo either."
Well, you don't look like my damsel in distress either.
Excuse me if I'm a little rusty.
Apparently the dating service doesn't understand metaphors.
I see you brought protection.
So how do you like the Date Knight app?
This isn't 'just a phase,' Carol.
So, Arthur, what do you do for a living?
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I wrote middle age in my profile.
So I'm wearing a suit. Are you happy now?
So that's why you requested a round table.
So you’re happy now that we got a round table?
I know you wore it in your profile pic but I thought that just meant you had a good sense of humor.
I wish just once you'd open up a little.
Or, you could just get a flu shot.
Another blind date, another awkward knight out.
Um, my dating profile actually specified that I was desperately seeking a middle-aged man, not a man from the Middle Ages.
Being middle aged doesn’t mean we have to dress that way!
When I said I was into the British Invasion I meant 60's rock, not the crusades.
I can see why you have problems with intimacy.
I said amour. Amour!
I get it, you've been hurt before...
Well, your profile clearly stated you were into heavy metal.
I’d love to date again but I’m a little rusty.
Sorry, but it takes about 3 people and some screw drivers to get me to open up
So, how do you know Susan?
You seem a bit guarded.
You looked shinier in your profile picture.
When your ad said middle-aged man, I’m afraid I drew the wrong conclusion.
By the way, fun fact - I’m also wearing an ankle monitor.
You would probably meet more people if you were less guarded.
It was metaphorical, Jack.
I thought you said 'amour'
So, I take it that you have intimacy issues.
Sorry, I'm not into one knight stands.
Yes, you did say that you were into heavy metal.....
I said I wanted a night of amour, not a knight of armor!
And you must be Lance.
This would be my first one knight stand.
When I asked if you had protection, that wasn't what I had in mind.
For God's sake, Frank, you have my consent to raise your visor.
Another one knight stand...
For some reason they always seat me at the round table
So the break-up left you feeling vulnerable.
Well, this has certainly been a knight to forget.
Are you sure you’re not bothered by our difference in age?
I'm glad to see you finally got off your high horse.
Most women like the plume.
It's a very scary time for men in America.
We'd probably have the bread basket by now if you hadn't called her "wench".
You and the horse you rode in on.
Oh, swell.  Another one knight stand.
I'm looking for someone a little less rigid.
I said I was seeking amour, not armor.
I said I wanted a romantic night!
You seem defensive tonight
I'll be honest - I have a hard time being vulnerable.
I can't tell you the last time I had a knight out
So that's what you meant by Renaissance man.
So I see you prefer a round table over a booth.
"Diane, this might be a little forward on our first date, but for baby names, I like, Lance a lot"
Everyone’s looking for a knight in shining armor, but no one ever asks me what I’m looking for.
I'm in the White House press corps, why do you ask?
Don't worry. I'll wear protection.
Yes, you got us the round table. I'm very impressed.
Don’t worry, I’ve dated men with tough exteriors before.”
All I said was, "We need to talk."
My profile said middle aged not Middle Ages...
And the horse you came in on?
Looks like another one knight stand.
I misread your personal ad – I thought it said you were looking for someone "middle aged."
Wow, this suit really makes a fart sound like a foghorn!
You've got a little something stuck in your helmet.
I'll have the swordfish.
I told you when you called that I had no interest in a one-knight stand.
Our relationship would be a lot stronger if you'd just let your guard down
When it comes to dating, I'm a little rusty.
Do I look like a woman in distress?
At best, this will be a one knight stand.
Why are you always so defensive?
I just feel like you're masking your true feelings.
When you said you were a Renaissance man I was picturing something a little different
So then after I graduated from knight school...
I don’t know why you’re surprised—I told you I reserved a round table.
I understand. We’ve all been wounded.
I've been told it's a scary time for men.
My entry under Interests said:  " amour"  not "armor."
My personal did say middle aged!
My personal ad said that I'm looking for 'amour' not 'armor'!
I told the agency I liked middle aged men, not men from thee Middle Ages
This is so much more intimate than my usual round table.
What am I looking for in a woman? That's easy. Distress.
I hope this date doesn't end up as just another one knight stand.
Could thee get me a straw?
No, I don't know how astronauts use the bathroom.
Yeah, and I'm a dead ringer for Guinevere.
So, you took me literally.
Am I sensing some disenchantment?
Stop being so defensive.
I said ‘date night’, not ‘date knight.’
I really need to remove "seeks strong,silent type" from my dating profile.
You do know what a metaphor is,  right?
I can't believe you made us wait an extra hour for a round table.
So....why did you insist on a round table?
I meant date night,not date knight.
You seem to have some trust issues.
It’s our third date. Will you at least tell me your pronoun?
Let me guess. You don't have pockets for your wallet?
Your profile said you were a man in the Middle Ages but I thought that meant you were 45-65.
Maybe I'm wrong, but you seem a bit defensive tonight.
Sue never said you were middle-aged.
I said I wanted a NIGHT out on the town.
Thanks for choosing the round table.
I take it vulnerability is not your strong point.
I'm a little rusty at this dating thing.
But anyways, enough about my personal crusades. What do you like to do on the weekends?
This is definitely going to be my last one knight stand!
Would you mind taking your glasses off?
We’d be on dessert by now if you hadn’t insisted on waiting for a round table.
Leather, I could understand.
My mother always told me to wear protection.
Yeah, so I lied too. I am not really a queen.
John, it's no longer funny when you order the 'Sir Loin'.
I wouldn't say I'm a damsel, but I'm definitely distressed.
Sorry. I'm rusty at this.
Sometimes I feel like you're not in there anymore.
My other suit is at the smithy's.
I think you took what I was looking for too literally.
I totally agree, its a dangerous time to be a man.
It's a very scary time for young men in America right now.
How long have you been a mail man?
When Janet described you, I thought she was speaking metaphorically
Well, my profile did mention I was middle aged.
So, you're from LaMancha? Is that near Toledo?
A knight out. Very funny.
So it really was a current photo.
I have intimacy issues.
I have a hard time opening up to people
You might as well get the swordfish.
Yes, your profile said you're into heavy metal...
Over time David learned to cope with Susan's sharp tongue.
Lance, you know I prefer a booth, but you always insist on a round table.
Well, you don't look like *your* photo either.
I know my profile said I was into heavy metal...
This date is a knightmare.
I hope this isn't another one knight stand!
Your Tinder profile didn’t mention you were into heavy metal.
I’ll need a little help when the soup comes.
I was hoping you'd have a bit more polish.
The flu shot just doesn't seem to be enough anymore.
You should be very happy - the maitre d' gave us the only round table.
Sorry, I came straight from work.
This wasn’t what I meant when I said I like guys into heavy metal.
Oh, you said 'amour'...
Yes, I've been hurt a few times. How can you tell?
Sorry, but I think your party is sitting at the larger round table, behind you.
I made sure to reserve a round table.
You seem a little closed off.
Its so refreshing when someone's profile photo actually matches them in person.
How would you have dressed for a square table?
The suit is a rental but I own the lance.
Well, mainly because Brett Kavanaugh is a much more common name than people realize.
Is that a sword in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
Regrettably, Gwen had assumed her date’s online profile promising “a knight to remember” included a typo.
That's not what I meant when I said make sure to bring protection.
Defensive? I’m not being defensive!
I liked you better in the hallway
And then ideally I’d slay the dragon and save the princess. What about you? What’s your perfect date?
I don't care how big your sword is, Mr. Lancelot.
Well, I see being middle aged as a good thing.
I wasn't in distress until you called me a 'damsel.'
Sorry. I've no interest in a one-knight stand.
You seem nice, and all, but I like my knights in white satin.
So, when I was young they called me Lance, a lot.
Mother always said be careful what you wish for.
It's been ages since my last blind date. I'm a bit rusty.
I identify as Medieval. You?
I told the dating service that I wanted a NIGHT person"
This is my last 'one-knight' stand.
I  have  not  been  on  a  date  in
ages!
I know I can seem a bit guarded.
Interested in a one knight stand?
Thank you for getting off your high horse -- now, if you just open up and talk to me.
It’s the armor, isn’t it?
You were shinier in your profile.
So your profile said you're a damsel in distress.
I'm smiling on the inside.
Fine. Fine. Just keep your sword in your pants.
I’m getting hints of tobacco, leather, and just a slight metallic finish.
I guess I keep my guard up in some ways, too.
It would be a lot easier if you just got the flu shot.
You know, it's a very scary time for young men in America.
You don't need that. I'm on the pill.
Pick up the check? I can hardly pick up my glass!
You ever think YOU’RE the one being defensive?
You don't look like your profile either.
I said looking for a single night. Damn autocorrect.
I always use protection.
I can see you're not ready for commitment.
Why must you always be so defensive?
I can totally relate. I call my first marriage the Dark Ages.
A screwdriver would be better
You are too defensive. I didn't say dull, I said you're a little tarnished.
I'm being defensive?!?
Usually my dates don't put on protection until after dinner.
My chastity belt is killing me.
Just for ONCE could we sit at a SQUARE table/
Want to get a little errant?
I just don't feel like you ever let your guard down.
Medieval Studies at Indiana. Why do you ask?
'Tis not thou, 'tis me.
Did you order the WD 40?
I transitioned to heavy metal after gothic rock.
My therapist says I need to work on letting my guard down.
Something tells me you've been hurt before.
The service is terrible here, I've been waiting ages.
I'm actually an accountant by day. This is just my knight job.
For me, you're just another one knight stand......
Worst date knight ever.
you need to let your guard down
I said I wanted amour.
Thank you for wearing protection Bob.
Your ad said, 'Tall, funny, middle-ages'.
I was hoping for someone middle-aged, not from the Middle Ages.
It is just one glass of wine, you won't become unhinged
Let me guess.  This is going to be a one-knight stand, right?
So — what do you do?
I overdressed again didn't I?
This is a very scary time for young men in America.
It’s just that you’ve become so...guarded...
Wow! You really meant it when you said you wear "protection!"
I really thought you would get us a better table, Arthur.
The aluminum tariffs have hit us especially hard
I specifically requested the round table, just for you.
I just wish you would understand that there is a person in here
I swear, this isn't a one knight stand.
I'm not really in to heavy-metal.
I feel like I can never get through to you.
My ex girlfriend told me I had a hard time letting my guard down.
Sorry, I’m just not into Heavy Metal.
So... you’re in between jobs?
I can’t open up.
How would I know if the men's room has a socket wrench?
You looked a lot shinier in your picture.
I gotta be honest, I never do anything on the first knight.
So let me get this straight, you slayed a dragon but had to have the sommelier open the twist cap off the wine.
We've both changed. But you've tarnished.
Yes, your profile said you are into heavy metal. My bad.
Well, yes, I guess I am happy to see that you are wearing protection but...
When your singles profile said that you were a renaissance man, I didn't think it was literal.
What can I say? It’s a scary time to be a man.
Just because there is a sale doesn't mean you have to buy it.
Well, you look nothing like your dating profile picture either.
I feel like you’re being defensive.
It's hard to see eye-to-eye with you.
Please tell me you’re in distress.
I told them I wanted a date tonight, not a knight to date.
I thought by our third date, you'd let your guard down.
It’s just so difficult to open up on a first date.
I don’t know, you just seem so guarded these days.
When you said you were coming straight from Knight school I thought you meant something else...
So tell me: Why is this knight different from every other knight?
We know its you Mr. Kavanagh.
You always seem so guarded
Was everything OK at work?  You seem a bit defensive.
When your profile promised “a knight to remember”, I prayed you were just a terrible speller.
Well, I appreciate that you use protection.
I take it you're only interested in a one-knight stand?
Yes, it's a ROUND table.  I get it.
You're a lot older-looking than your profile picture.
For this relationship to go anyway; you need to let your guard down
I haven't dated in awhile, so forgive me if I'm a little rusty.
I think you misunderstood me when I said I wanted a night out on the town.
How far back do you want to go?
I’m sure they would have taken that at coat check.
My friend said 'Renaissance man', but you look positively Medieval.
You know it's a metaphor, right?
Yeah, I know...it's a really scary time for boys and men right now.
I'm sorry but I haven't dated in Ages.
I'm just guessing, but do you have problems with intimacy​
I just don't want to get hurt again.
Leonard, "verbal jousting" is a figure of speech.
This isn’t going to work unless you can open up to me.
Shall we drink to a one knight stand?
I liked you better when chivalry was dead...
It was my only clean suit
Here's to a knight that you won't forget.
Honestly, I think we can just be two women having a drink, without this elaborate disguise.
Who knew they were going to ban straws?
It's an open relationship. Whenever he gets to have a night out, I get to have a knight in.
You seem rather defensive.
Why do you always have to be so defensive?
But enough about me, how do you feel about beheadings?
I have an idea on what may have happened here.
I told the dating service lady that I enjoy quiet nights.
Some say I'm too guarded
I am the dark and stormy knight!
You never really let your guard down with me.
And now I have to deal with these ridiculous bans on straws.
Oh.  It's speed dating for the middle-aged, not the Middle Ages.
Well, you're not exactly what I pictured as my Lady in Waiting either!
I don't know why you always make such a big deal about sitting at a round table.
You strike me as a guy with intimacy issues"
There were perfectly fine square tables we didn't have to wait an hour for.
Frankly I think its presumptuous to wear protection on our first date
I'm naked underneath.
I know: I look nothing like my profile. I've gone through a sort of renaissance.
Yet another boring knight alone.
Let me guess. This is your idea of ‘irony.’
Well, you're as up to date as most men these days.
OK, I get it - you don't want to talk.
The sitter just called. The peasants are in revolt again.
Your profile said Under Armour.  I was thinking athletic.
I think you're being defensive.
Knight on the town
I asked for a "night" to remember...
Don't expect me to be a pawn.
I'm a bit rusty on the dating scene.
I think that your therapist is an idiot, Harold.
After the divorce I said to myself, ‘You’ve got to get back on the horse.’
I guess this qualifies as incognito, but you're still attracting attention.
Well, now that you mention it, you're not what I expected either."
I have a hard time letting people in.
I'm not into Heavy Metal.
The Round Table is a lot smaller than I thought."
So ma'am, how long have you been in distress?
That's not exactly what I meant when I asked you to bring protection.
I told you I wasn't ready for a face-to-face meeting.
You seem a little defensive for a first date.
Apparently we have different expectations for date knight.
Look, I thought we sorted this out last time.
I did not mean to stab you with the fork.
I guess you could say I am guarded.
Well at least you look like your profile picture.
If you think it's a scary time for men now, just wait till November 6th.
This isn't quite the date knight I imagined.
If you'll excuse me, I must use the men's room. I'll be right back in an hour and a half.
And that's how I became the King of England. So, what do you do for work?
Of course, it’s not ALL raping and pillaging, but we have fun.
I know everyone's a little guarded on the first date, but this is ridiculous.
Another blind date, another bad knight.
Why the long mace?
What's your problem?  Your profile said 'love heavy metal.'
Oh, I thought you said you went to "night" school.
Yes, but I also enjoy verbal jousting.
It's just hard to get through to you...
This isn't what I meant when I told you to bring some protection.
I pictured something else when I read "Man of Steel" in your profile.
Frankly I think your attitude is positively medieval.
What kind of relationship can we expect if you won't open up?
I wasn’t in distress until you sat at my table.
Not what I meant when I said I wanted a night out, Jerry.
No, your knight will not be taking my queen.
I like you a lot, Lance.
Knight cap??
Queen checks knight
You just seem a little defensive.
Miriam! It's been ages!
Clerking for Kavanaugh?
I swear, this is the last time I use a figure of speech in a personal ad.
That's not what I mean about always wearing protection, son.
Well, you looked a lot less middle-aged online too.
You seem a little stiff.
I meant "Knight in Shining Armor" as a metaphor, Ronald.
What makes you say I'm old fashioned?
I don't think this is going to work out.  You're always so guarded.
Should we start with the WD-40?
I care about the environment, too, but I need a straw.
Would you say you’re an introvert?
I was hoping for a one knight stand.
As you can imagine, I hate the ban on straws
This is nice. I like their round tables.
Is that your jousting pole or are you just happy to meet me?
Stop complaining. You're not the one wearing a chastity belt.
I think I'll start with a few squirts of 3 in 1 oil.
Your move
I'm not sure a relationship can be built on plague, pestilence, and death. But I'm willing to try.
I gotta remember to be less literal on my second wish."
My friends call me Lance ....... joust kidding!
I guess you are pleased that we are at a round table!
I thought your message said you were enamoured.
It's a really scary time for men right now.
"It's a little heavy, but the SPF rating is great.
So I hear you like to dance. I like to lance. A lot.
I think your text autocorrected amour.
It's just my luck to find a genie that's way too literal.
As a restaurant critic I must protect my identity.
I hate it when you go all medieval on me, Morty.
I'll be impressed when you pick up the check.
("Note to self: Spell Check won't catch 'Seeking a pleasant knight out.'")
I'm not being defensive. You're being defensive.
You're so guarded.
This time don't leave the tip in farthings.
Your helmet looked bigger online.
Well you look nothing like your profile picture either!
What kind of knight in shining amour forgets his wallet?
It's getting hard to not feel like you're shutting me out.
Of course I love Camelot Harry. I'm just saying it couldn't hurt to see a shrink.
My therapist says I struggle to let myself be vulnerable.
Sorry about that.  I guess I'm a little rusty.
This isn't my first round table.
So, on the third date you wear protection
I can't help feeling that you're hiding something from me, Frank.
Hey, no need to get defensive.
And the cell-phone reception is fantastic!
My profile did say I was interested in men into heavy metal, but I had something else in mind.
It's the only round table they had.
This is a very scary time for young men.
Haven't you heard? Men are under attack.
That's not what I meant when I asked if you had protection.
You’re going to the men’s room?  How long will you be gone?
Let's get out of here, the knight is young.
Of course I’m in distress. I just don’t need rescuing.
So I see you’re into heavy metal.
Sorry, I'm looking for someone less guarded.
Safe sex, huh?
I just got out a relationship with a Renaissance man.
It's just so hard to read you sometimes.
Whaddya say we go back to my castle and I slip into my Under Armour?
When I said, "I'm into heavy metal," this isn't quite what I meant.
Well, at least they gave us a round table.
You did suggest that I wear protection...
I wish you would open up.
Knight after knight, the same thing....
You said a knight out on the town.
I've been hurt before.
I had different expectations for a one-night stand.
When you said a knight on the town I had no idea.
I'm into walks on the beach, puppies, piña coladas and Renaissance fairs. You?
Sorry I'm late, I just got off the knight shift.
Is this table round enough for you, Derek?
Damn auto correct, I meant I wanted a NIGHT to remember.
I’m just messing with you - chivalry really is dead.
Call me your "wench" one more time and I'm going to put a size 8 chink in your armor.
You do know they're expecting rain this evening
This is a smaller round table than I'm used to.
I've been hurt a lot.
That’s odd. Why only restaurants with round tables?
So refreshing to meet a man who looks like his online photo.
Well, that's what you get for letting your phone auto-correct "date night
It was on sale.
Ah, amour! A much misunderstood word.
I'm sorry this role playing hasn't helped our marriage.
Yes, I taste the irony.
I was almost on Lancing With the Stars, you know.
Are you a fan of heavy metal?
It's really hard for me to open up to people
You wrote that you liked hot summer knights.
I wouldn’t worry about people staring if you used a straw.
Well, actually, my profile said "Middle Ages Guy"" not "middle-aged guy."
You've always had a hard time opening up.
I don't know quite how to tell you this Helen, but I've lost the key to your chastity belt.
Yes, I do have protection.
Got mail?
You're tough to read
Awkward Date Knight
YOU SEEM A LITTLE GUARDED
So, the pellet with the poison’s in the chalice from the palace?
No, I will not be your pawn.
Chivalry is dead if we split the check.
I'm fresh off a particularly combative relationship.
How long ago was your last relationship?
So tell me me about yourself, Helen of White Plains.
If we make it to a third date, maybe I’ll let you see Excalibur.
Yeah, well I thought your round table would be bigger.
Do I have "protection"? Excuse me- isn't it obvious?
A knight to remember... yes, I get it.
When I was a kid, "page not found" meant I had to carry my own sword.
You must be taking the ban on straws pretty hard.
You may be overplaying this 'men are under attack' nonsense, Stanley.
I don't let my guard down until the third date.
You seem so defensive this evening.
Since our country is returning to the middle ages I thought I would dress for it.
I said I wanted to meet a middle-aged man, not a Middle Ages man.
They say it's a dangerous time for men in America.
I'm just being prudent.
Will you settle for a statistician in shining armor?
I understand your anger. The ban on straws seems to have unfairly targeted some people.”
I like a Renaissance man.
You said you were into heavy metal but....
Usually takes a few dates before I let my guard down.
Let's call it a knight.
So, enough about me . . .
If this date turns out to be a success, would I be able call you back in, let’s say.. a fortnight?
I am done with middle-aged men
This isn't my first round table Carole.
And what do you do for a living?
I worry your attitude toward women is a little medieval.
But Mom, YOU were the one who said I should always wear protection.
So do you have any hobbies?
This isn’t going to work if you’re not ready to open up.
You know, a condom would have been just fine.
You may have heard, it's an incredibly scary time for young men.
I’m kind of a Renaissance man.
When you told me that you went to night school, I didn't realize...
Probably need to delete "chivalry a must" on my E-Harmony profile.
Look, you're a great damsel, but I'm not feeling the distress.
I know you're still thinking of Guinevere."
I was hoping you'd be less defensive.
This is nothing, you should see the round table back at my place.
No, I'm not getting a metallic taste. Just cherry and black currant.
I wanted a date night -- not a date knight.
I should have been less specific.
Just another awkward knight on the town.
Guinevere never asked to split the check.
You looked shinier in your profile pic
You wanted a knight on the town, right?
Is this just a one knight stand?
This is my first date in quite a while. I'm a little rusty
Surely you joist . . .
That really is my lance, but I am happy to see you.
So, what line of work you in?
Here's to the horse you came in on.
Well. . .  my other suit had a rust stain
So, tell me about this rash.
I also have a dungeon.
I said I wanted a date night, not date a knight
I used to be a damsel in distress.  Now I am just distressed.
What can I say? Love is a battlefield.
My last relationship left me feeling somewhat vulnerable.
Well, we’ve all been hurt before.
I’m putting the tin back in tinder.
I would invite you over, but I have a very early Crusade tomorrow morning.
I’m sorry if I seem defensive.
I'm sorry, I am just not into heavy metal.
I don't think I'm being defensive.
I'd thought the Dating Service had merely promised a good night.
I told you honey, it’s a scary time to be a man.
So...umm...boxers or briefs?
So... Are you seeing anyone?
A textbook example of ‘Passive-Defensive’ behavior.
Surely there are other options to quit smoking?
Why can't you get a smart phone and ignore me like a normal person?
I see that you have been hurt before...
Too literal?
Is this table round enough for you?
That’s the third selection you’ve told him has a slightly metallic taste.
Is this your first date after the Kavanaugh hearing?
I always bring protection on a second date.
If this relationship is to go forward, you've got to let your guard down..
When I read your profile, I thought you meant heavy metal music.
This is my first date in a while. I'm a little rusty.
My other suit is with the blacksmith.
Feeling a little defensive, are we?
Sally suddenly realized that this would not be a one knight stand
I'm your knight in dining armor.
I don't date much either.
I always bring protection on a first date.
I am looking for a man who likes to cuddle.
You've been acting very defensive, lately.
Your ad clearly stated, “desparately seeking my knight in shining armor.”
Ok, Harry. I get it. Chivalry is not dead.
When you said you would be bringing protection, I never imagined that you meant this
I think you’ll find me a knight to remember.
I’m on a crusade.
I always imagined the Round Table to be a bit bigger.
Mike Pence recommended it.
Knight in shining armor-finally an online dating profile that’s accurate.
Wanda finally meets her knight in shining armor and discovers he's 53, twice-divorced, with bad credit and no retirement savings.
They always think they're soooo funny--seating us at the round table.
What is it they always say?  "Be careful what you wish for!"
When I said “chivalry is dead” I just wanted you to open the door for me.
I said I believe in chivalry. I didn’t say I’d pay for dinner.
I'm glad we met up - you look exactly like your tapestry.
I'm sure you've had your share of lonely knights.
No, I don’t think you do know the meaning of Renaissance man.
Lisa quickly realized she had misspelled  'date night '.
I'm a bit of a Renaissance man.
Yes, I know you go to the bathroom “like everyone else.”  I meant the logistics
Honestly, when I agreed to this, I thought you said a "night of amour"...
Magnetic, yes. Personality, not so much.
I find it hard to let my guard down.
Did you check your coat of arms?
So, did you bring protection?
Witness Protection? Why do you ask?
Not for one brief shining moment, you perv.
Why are you being so defensive?
Now I understand why you requested a round table.
It’ will never work. You’re just too guarded for me, Harold.
I’m tasting a metallic note.
Your avatar makes more sense now.
I think you’re being a bit defensive.
Guess this just another "One Knight Stand!"
If I wore protection, would you be into a one knight stand?
Your Tinder says you appreciate a man who always wears protection.  And that you’re no easy conquest.
I hope it wasn't too forward of me to bring protection.
Nice to meet you, Gawain.  What is your Sir name?
Flossing must be hell for you.
What a Lady, What a Knight
Well, you got your round table, but can you Uber me home? The horse was a bit much.
Frankly, you look much older than your profile photo
So that’s your best suit?
That's not what I meant by a nice night out and you know it.
Yes, I wrote that in my profile but I didn’t mean it literally.
Cougar seeks millennial” didn’t mean the year 1000
Oh, really? You think men are under attack?
Sorry. It’s laundry day.
In vino veritas? Surely you joust.
So, do you like horses?
So what's your plan now that straws are illegal?
This'll probably shape up to be a one-knight stand.
Do we always have to pick the round table?
It looked shinier in your photo
Mr. Vice President, I'm glad you found a way to meet with me.
I think you have vulnerability issues.
You said date knight. That’s what you said.
If I'm being honest, Bertrand, half of the time I'm not sure you're even there"
Soooo,you always carry protection.
I have a hard time letting my guard down.
Republican?
I hope that's a glass of WD-40.
Down the hatch!
I thought it was an auto-correct mistake, but you really did mean a knight on the town
They say it’s a very scary time for young men in America.
Well I think you’re impenetrable too.
They got you a round table,now what's wrong
I guess it's a defense mechanism.
Once a queen, always a queen but once a knight is enough.
I know you think it's "a dangerous time to be a man", but this just makes me want to strangle you more, Hank."
Thanks for not wearing white satin.
Good luck. No straws are allowed in this city!
Well, it is a round table."
I wrote that as a metaphor.
It's probably best you just keep it on, Brett.
I apologize if I'm a little guarded.
Do you always reserve a round table?
My past blind dates have made me a little defensive.

‘I miss your soft side.’
I read it as amour.
Your armor looked shinier in your profile pictures.

A condom would suffice.
Would it have killed you to at least shine the damn suit?
Joanne kicked herself - she'd brought regular lubricant but left the WD-40 at home.
It was right in the Antique Store window, and somehow, no one had bought it yet. Anyway, I'm Kevin.
I do love a man in uniform
I'm sorry, I've just been hurt too many times.
I don't care how much you believe the wine loosens you up, you still squeak.
I know you asked for the round table but I'd really prefer a booth.
So Lawrence, when are you coming out?
Don't take it personally.  I prefer my Knights in white satin.
Ok, I'm ready to talk about our relationship.
Oh, you wanted a NIGHT to remember.
Too literal, Frank.
Me?  I like lemon drop martinis, walks on the beach at sunset, a good book on a rainy night, and impaling heathen invaders with my trusty lance.
When you called and told me that you'd been canned, frankly this wasn't what I was expecting.
Well you don't look like your profile picture either.
Why don't you ask for a straw?"
Sylvia quickly grew to regret being the winning bidder in the "Knight on the Town" charity auction.
I always insist on a round table.
What do you mean you can’t get through to me?
So how long ago was your tinder picture taken?
The outfit I can deal with. It's your politics I can't stand.
I just don't want to get hurt, you know?
What? It's a very scary time for young men in America.
I want a relationship where I can let my guard down.
What's your day job?
So...how was your quest?
Just so you know, I don't joust on the first date.
On the other hand, you're the first blind date I couldn't see right through...
I find that hand sanitizer also works.
Actually, I'm not  a 'one knight stand' type of girl.
To be honest,the whole knight in shining armor-chivalry narrative kind of unravelled when you insisted on separate checks.
I thought you said,one night stand.
I am working through some intimacy issues.
They say you should always wear protection these days.
Is that suit off the rack?  Because I heard the guy on the rack doesn't need it anymore.
We've been married for 40 years and I still don't really know you...
I can see you have issues with intimacy.
My ex said I was hard to read.
So, I've been out of the dating scene for a while.
The bartender here is known for his amazing screwdrivers.
I keep my guard up on the first date
Don’t tell me…we live happily ever after.
Your disappointment is palpable, my lady, though — to speak truth — you’re no Guinevere either.
I was really looking for something more than just a one-Knight stand.
Sometimes, I feel middle-aged, too.
I'm looking for someone middle-aged
...and Harold Limpkin, you're no Lancelot.
And yet you didn't hold the door for me?
My mother told me to use protection
I'm a little rusty when it comes to first dates, too.
Yes, I brought protection. Why do you ask?
Well... how old do you think I am?
Come to think of it, yes, I AM presently in need of rescuing.
You don't look anything like your profile picture either.
Can't we have just one night out when we don't fight?
Aren't there supposed to be more of you around the table?
You did wish for a knight out on the town.
I'm rethinking the whole knight-in-shining-armor thing.
I should have never told you my name is Guinevere.
Sorry, but I like Lance a lot more.
Need a straw?
Forgive me but I’m a little rusty.
No, it’s fine..I just never thought to take your profile so...literally...
If you were a real knight in shining armor, you wouldn't ask me to split the bill.
I don't put it in my profile,but I'm heavy into metal.....
Bob, when you said you'd be wearing protection tonight, I thought you meant something else?
Would it be rude to ask for a straw?
It's a dangerous time for young men in America.
I see ... You thought I said I was into "amore."
Oh, Arthur, I haven't had a date knight in ages!
Your dating profile said you were a lover, not a fighter.
You think I'm the defensive one?
How long has it been since your divorce?
I checked your profile, it said you liked history and role playing. I just put the dots together.
It's just one Knight, come on.
This is my first time on MedievalMatch.com.
No, actually l'm a morning person.
Perhaps I was a little vague when I said I enjoyed heavy metal.
You remind me of my first boyfriend, shiny and dull at the same time."
When you said 'Ironman' , I though you were an athlete!
I thought this was for middle age singles.
So your sword wasn't innuendo?
I'm sorry, I thought you knew my ex husband was a bishop
The hardest part is finding a restaurant that will still give me a straw."
It's your move.
They say that once a knight is enough.
I need to go to the men's room. Do you have a can opener?
So when I told Alexa I needed a  Night Out
I suppose you left your wallet in your other suit of armor.
So how was work today, Larry?
[Run it without a caption next to Trump's remarks about how dangerous a time this is for boys and men.]
Now I understand why you asked for a round table.
What you may or may not have on under it is irrelevant
I never know how to dress on a first date.
Lately, I just can't seem to get through to you.
Really Arthur it was more of a metaphor
So, the search for the Holy Grail led you to a wine bar?
I'm sorry, but I like my damsels in distress.
It’s a dangerous time for young men.
I’ve always wanted to meet a Renaissance man.
I agree; the wine has a metallic taste.
They said you’d come”someday,” but at this point, I just don’t give a damn.”
Maybe, but inside I'm still a pirate.
I misread your profile. I thought you were seeking a woman who was interested in amour.
Howard, it's more the white horse that I've fantasized about.
No, I do not want to come up to your room and see your holy grail ...
I think you're at the wrong round table.
Where's all that 'chivalry is dead' talk now, Marge?
Shirley tells me you like horses...
No, I don't have a problem with middle-aged men.
Everything tastes like WD-40 to you!
Tell me about your mother...
Don't tell me that you are also wearing Under Armour.
It's nice to finally sit down after all these centuries.
You don't need to be so defensive.
I've got to stop swiping right after watching Game of Thrones.
When your dating profile said "Chivalry isn't dead," this isn't quite what I pictured.
Sometimes it’s hard to get through to you!
And another thing.  You never let down your defenses.
Why do you always seem so defensive?
Well, one: it was a metaphor, and two: you're not that shiny.
Me defensive?
No, I wouldn't say I'm especially "in distress." Why do you ask?
I wish you would let your guard down once in a while.
I figured I'd find you seated at a round table.
I see why he insisted on a round table.
I only need a few more to take off my armor.
I thought you would be shinier.
My hobbies??  I am into vintage clothing.
Not what​ I was picturing when you offered me a night out.
All of my friends think that chivalry is dead.
Look daggers at me all you want.  It won't do any good.
Wait, you’re an actuary too?
I sense you have some vulnerability issues.
Now it feels like you're getting defensive.
This is not going to be a knight to remember.
I think Under Armour is more sexy
I understand some of your restaurant reviews have been controversial.
I always request a round table.
Thank you for reserving the round table.
You said you wanted me to be more chivalrous!
Well, in my defense I did say that I have an active knight life!"
Yeah, that pic is a couple years old.
You're being defensive again.
Do I feel vulnerable after my last relationship?  Why do you ask?
Yep, it makes you look fat.
I said I wanted amour,not armor.
You’re not into heavy metal, are you?
You think the waitress forgot about my straw?
I always feel you’re hiding something.
You know, Toby, this ISN'T what I meant when I asked you about protection.
To be frank, I'm looking for something more than just a one knight stand
Uh, you called me Guinevere again."
"I asked Alexa for a nice night with an amour, so I'm guessing you're here because of autocorrection."
If this relationship is going anywhere, you're going to have to le your guard down.
So my ex-wife used to complain that I was too defensive about everything...
Don't make that face at me.
I thought your profile said, “Night of Amor.”
We all have itches we'd like to scratch.
Actually, all the tables are round.
Yes, I know what my profile said I was looking for, 
but you are the first guy to take me literally.
Why is this knight different from all other knights?
Well, your profile did say you had abs of steel.
You meet so few "Guinivere's" on Match.com that, frankly, I was intrigued
You look nothing like your photo.
No, Lance, I asked if you were, like, middle-aged.
Really....you ordered the ‘Sir Loin’?
And whither didst thou goest after graduate school?
You were so much more open online.
A knight out on the town sounded so good.
I go by Gwen, now.
Not what I meant when I said you need to bring protection.
Next time, try not to make a scene about a square table.
Maybe a glass of mead will help you loosen up.
This wasn’t what I was expecting when my profile noted I was into heavy metal
I guess protection is an ambiguous term.
My fetish leans more towards scrapbooking.
I'm a knight. We're at the round table. Your turn.
At least I'm willing to try new things, Diane.
I don't know about you, but I haven't been on a date in ages.
I was speaking figuratively.
You said to wear my best suit.
oh, you meant a one NIGHT stand.
Me? I'm the Brand Manager for Over Armour.
This new straw ban must be killing you!
Speak, that I may know you.
So, this is date knight.
First of all, I am not being defensive.
Are we making eye contact yet?
I’m always a little defensive on a first date.
So the knight picture is not just your online avatar.
I don’t joust on the first date.
You're not your typical one knight stand.
I said I wanted a date NIGHT...N-I-G-H-T!
Go ahead,  I want to see you drink it.
I'm actually a woman so that's on you for assuming.
I am glad that you brought protection.
It only takes one drink for me to open up. I'm just waiting for the straw.
What trust issues?
I work in hardware. How about you?”
When you said you were in the military, l guess I expected some thing else
A "knight" to remember. Really?
Well you said you didn't want to see me anymore
...and the horse you rode in on.
Did I mention I live in a castle?
Sorry I said 'Shut your trap'.
A boring knight on the town.
You're a lot rustier in person than you looked online.
I hope you don't find my wearing protection presumptuous.
I'm tasting black pepper, cherries and a hint of conquest.
It’s hard for me to let my guard down.
Don't tell me I misspelled  'date night'  again.
The counselor recommended amour, not armor!
Yes, I can see that, but who are you underneath it all?
You don’t look like the wench in your picture.
Do you have a straw
Careful what  you wish for.
So yeah, that’s how I haven’t been stung by a bee in over 35 years.
The quest is just my day job. My real passion is wine.
I see you still work at the Renaissance Fair.
It protects you as well as me.
Armor, Armani, six of one, half a dozen of another, am I right?
I’m gonna call it a knight.
My Friday knight was more fun.
I said wine and amour not... oh never mind
I hope you brought a can opener.
I am NOT being defensive!
I'm a little rusty.
I know how it feels,my Spanx is killing mem,too.
I’m just trying to get you to open up a little.
It has been ages since I opened myself up.
"Your dating-site profile comment about 'liking men in uniform' didn't specify which era
So tell me more about this book, Eat. Pray. Crusade.
My profile said I was interested in amore not armor.
No, no....let me guess.  Intimacy issues?
Sorry, I’m a little rusty
I’m always guarded on a first date!
This isn't going to work of you won't just open up a little.
Well yes, Lance, my ad did say that.
Yes, I am a republican, how did you guess?
It’s becoming harder for me to read your feelings.
It's not about your dating history, madam, I always wear protection.
Yes, I still see the chink in your armor after three drinks.
Actually it's Ralph, you're thinking of my brother Lance.
You've rusted your what?
Maybe we should just call it a night.
What do you mean, they’ve outlawed straws?
Sorry about the autocorrect. I meant, amore.
I suppose I use it as a sort of defense mechanism.
It's Chateau Nottingham, 1266.
Don't worry.  I brought protection
I said I was looking for amour not armor!
I think we'd best call it a knight.
What's the problem? You wanted a knight on the town.
Since you ask, I said I was seeking "a night of amour."
Great, another knight in shining armor.
It is a difficult and scary time for young men in America ...
...and you said I would never use it! Ha!
It looks like another boring knight.
I thought you said "knight cap".
So tell me about yourself Mr. Kavanaugh”
You need to open up more.
It's the personal magnetism bit that worries me.
You want me to tie my scarf around your what?
I said that I was looking for amour.
I'm so glad they were able to get us a round table
It's not what I expected when you said you had a "night" job.
You're always so defensive.
I just continue to have the feeling that you're hiding something...
You look shinier in your photo.
While I suspect your chivalrous heart is in the right place, I think we both can agree that your wallet is conveniently out of reach.
Our profiles both said "into heavy metal".  Not quite on the same page.
So, how long will you be gone?
Looks like we're both a little rusty at dating.
Knight in shining armor was a metaphor.
I wish you'd stop being so defensive.
Your castle or mine?
I know you've been hurt before, but you can open up to me.
What would you wear if we had a square table?
You call that activewear?
Funny. You wear yours on the outside.
Next time we role play, you’re the mid-level accountant.
I think you are sitting at the wrong round table.
I'm sorry, do you need a straw?
I am returning from the war of the rosés.  You?
Drinking straw ban? Well this is awkward.
If we are in a relationship, I'm going to need you to open up.
Shall we begin in some verbal jousting?
You could have just asked for a bib.
Your breath still stinks
Mary couldn’t understand why her footsie attempts were not reciprocated.
98% match, my ass!
I thought you were going to night school.
Gee, I thought you were just being metaphorical in your personal ad.
Your reservation for the round table was a very thoughtful gesture m'lady.
Well, so far I'm still the Deputy Attorney General.
You look rustier than your profile picture!
I was really worried you wouldn't match your profile picture.
The real me comes out after a few glasses of wine
At least you requested a round table!
So when you wrote ‘Seeking Knight in Shining Armor’ that was figuratively speaking?”
On the plus side, male coworkers pretty much leave me alone now.
To be perfectly honest, Ulrich, I believe I was happier when I thought chivalry was dead.
My therapist says I’m too defensive.
Y'know, I've just about decided that it might be more convenient to just go ahead and get a flu shot.
Why don't we take the horse back to my place?
Your ex still comes here?
Agreed. You will stop saying you think Trump is great and I will stop throwing hot coffee in your face
Hard to read? How so?
It's our third date can you at least lift your visor?
You were shinier in your profile picture.
My psychiatrist said I needed better defense mechanisms.
I don't know, it's just that you seemed more gallant at the Renaissance fair.
You require my fealty?
I have heard of using protection on a first date, but this is ridiculous!
You'll enjoy a knight out, they said...
You said you wanted a knight to remember.
I suggested role-playing in the bedroom, not at dinner...
No, I’m not being defensive, you are!
Today, I'm identifying as 35% female, 25% male, and 40% sheet metal from China.
Soooo, you said change was difficult for you.
Yeah, the visor is a pain alright, but the codpiece is what really cramps my style.
I said that I wanted to meet a thin man, not a tin man.
Well I think you're the one being defensive.
But I’m emotionally vulnerable
Do you think they'll judge me if I ask for a straw?
Just keep your codpiece where I can see it.
Wine always helps me let my guard down.
To be fair, your ad did say you were looking for a good night
When you said you liked to joust, I assumed you meant verbally.
I heard you have a rapier wit.
You thought I meant a night on the town?
It opens if you swipe right.
Well, I think *you're* guarded.
What do you mean, I'm too defensive?
Another iron clad alibi why you are late?
I’m into heavy metal.
I'm just glad to finally get a knight out.
I said I wanted a “date night “ not a “knight date”!!!
I take it you've been hurt before?
I'd always envisioned it being more - ya know - shining.
I wish you could be more vulnerable with me.
I had guessed you said to call you ‘Rusty’  because you’d have red hair.
I was speaking metaphorically.
I gotta be honest, I swiped right 'cause I thought it was a metaphor.
My last blind date said he was Prince Charming.
Don’t worry, everyone feels guarded on first dates
I don’t think I can get past your defense mechanisms.
My mistake. I thought that app was ‘middle agers dating service.’
I guess we've both decided to get back on the horse.
Why do they always put me at the round table?
My Mom made it for me when I started dating.
You forgot to bring your straws again?
If I hear you say this has a metallic taste one more time...
This is why I need to dress you.
You might want to ask for a straw.
Look on the bright side. If I'm a knight in shining armor, then that makes you a fair maiden.
I said I wanted "date night" not to date a knight.
You’re not the first rough knight I’ve had!
No, I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to call it a defense mechanism.
When I said "Show me a night I'll never forget," this isn't what I had in mind.
I didn’t grasp just how “old fashioned” you are.
I meant metaphorically.
Dating on Tinder has made me somewhat defensive."
Shall we call it a knight?
I know they sound the same, but  I meant date "night."
Ask for a straw.
I did promise you that it would be a Knight To Remember.
Hmm, have you been waiting long?
My parents named me Lance. Why did you want to know?
For the last time, Frank, I'm 61. You don't need protection.
Well, my friend did say you were a Renaissance man.
I don’t know, somehow it just feels like the same thing knight after knight.
Honey did you remeber to put the moat bridge up before we left?
I love these intimate moments.
He was a dark and stormy knight.
This is not at all what I expected when I won the “Night on the Town” contest!
No, you can ask for a straw yourself, Brad.
I’m a bit rusty at this.
'Frank, usually one lets one's guard down by the 3rd date!'
I told you if you put it on you wouldn't be able to take it off.
Another knight, soon to be forgotten.
I'm basically an introvert."
Would you like to see my sword?
I think you're a little bit defensive.
So...I can tell you're new to MedievalDating.com
I wonder if the meat is locally slain.
Okay, I’m ready. What do you have to tell me?
Do you use protection?
No, I said that I wanted more amour in our life
I'm waiting to hear THIS iron-clad alibi!
I thought having a knight out on the town would be more exciting.
Gee. I never realized the difficulties inherent in shopping for a codpiece online.
I'm not interested in a one knight stand.
Didn’t your ad say you wanted a Date Knight ?
Sorry about my conversational skills. I'm a little rusty
But I’m chainmail and you’re email, Gwen. It’ll never work.
I hope they have straws.
Would you mind if we moved to a rounder table?
You really have to fight for a table at this place.
My Job? Well, I’m currently on a quest, but the occasional pillage is rather lucrative
Its full, fruity bouquet and balanced tannins  are  spoiled by the frankly disappointing metallic finish.
Do you have a straw on you?
So you work the knight shift?
When you said you enjoyed metal, I thought you meant endless guitar solos.
Do you think maybe you're being a little defensive?
Because I'd like to be on the Supreme Court someday.
A knight on the town?  Really?
It's a dangerous time for men.
As I'm sure you can guess, I've got a thing for round tables.
And what doth a fair damsel like yourself doeth?
Are you getting a metallic aftertaste?
If I had known you were going to wear your suit,I would have at least put on my kirtle
Hey, YOU were the one complaining chivalry was dead.
I know it's tacky, but I really could use a straw.
I’m more of a day person.
That’s not a reassuring costume for discussing the divorce, Donald.
You should see me when I get unhinged
Yours may be the only diet that actually works.
So now I’M the armor-plated bitch?
Could you ask the waiter for a straw?
Please stop playing footsie, it's painful
Oh - date "night".
You're a little rusty at this dating thing, aren't you?
I know it’s hard to let your guard down on a first date, but at least maybe you could put your visor up?
No, I'm not getting a metallic aftertaste.
Janet immediately regretted asking her date to bring protection...And now feared what he meant by "sword".
‘I’m tired of jousting with you, David. Seems that’s all you ever want to do.’
I believe in safe sex.
I've been hurt one too many times..
When I said I liked heavy metal, I was talking about the '80's".
Not to brag but I also carry a large sword, live in a castle and arrived here on my noble steed.
So this is your idea of a knight out on the town?
It's a hard one...I'd say I'm pro-environment, but I'm also pro-straw.
Did you notice I fixed the squeaking?
I knew we'd click, I'm wearing a chastity belt.
This is NOT what you meant when you said to bring protection?
Well, here we are, round table for two.
To be honest, I had always kind of dreamed that my knight in shining armor would at least pick up the check.
My therapist suggested removing my emotional armor, so I'm trying this.
Most guys who read my profile have a better understanding of the concept of metaphor.
Before this goes any further, you should know that I'm not that kind of lady-in-waiting.
Maybe my problem is I try too hard to be what women want me to be.
I agree.  It's got a metallic taste.
I just wish you were more Transparent, that's all.
I feel like you're closing yourself off from me.
Would you like to get a room for a knight?
Of course I look like my profile picture under here.
So nice of you to get us a round table for two.
So,how's that metalsmithing class?
This isn’t what I meant by a one night stand
So, you’ll chainmail me?
Can we go by car? TSA is an issue.
What’s wrong with a knight on the town?
Okay, but this is the last time: "Prithee, m'lord, I am but a country lass..."
All right, I get it. For you, this is just a one knight stand.
Do you use protection Arthur?
You want to stop seeing me?  Shirley, you joust!
I'm not much of a talker either.
This could be my worst date Knight ever
Just admit you were cavalier with the waiter.
Forgive my attire. I report forCNN and I'm on my way to a Trump rally.
After my last relationship ended, I'll admit I'm a little guarded.
Do we have to do this on a knightly basis?
I'm afraid that this is not going to work, Phil. I  just can't get through to you.
I said bring your suit and ardor.
I really wish you'd open up a little.
So... you think you're the first to use a line like "Tonight's the Knight"?
This is getting ridiculous, no body from Yale is going to recognize you 36 years later
As your aide, Senator McConnell, I'd advise against eating out anymore, period.
Why so defensive?
I heard you have an emotional support horse.
No, really, I'm glad you wore your best suit.
I like your suit too... Ann Taylor?
So much for thinking that "middle ages"  in your profile was an autocorrect for "middle aged"
Let's just agree that you are only a metaphor and  call it a day.
I don't think this is going to work.  You just seem too guarded.
Mister, I'm not interested in any one knight stands.
Well, your profile did say you were old-fashioned.
Nice try, George, but chivalry is still dead.
I'm a big fan of safe sex.
I don't think this'll work out. You're too defensive.
I have to say, from your profile picture I was expecting you to be taller.
I was just wondering how things are going with you...no need to get so defensive.
Let us skip the small talk and get straight to the rescue.
Late middle age is when I found my true calling.
Congrats, you finally got your round table.
What’s wrong?  You seem a thousand years away.
Would you be embarrassed if I asked for a straw?
So, do you joust around here?
This is not what I had in mind when I asked for a night out on the town.
...then ask for a straw!
Just another knight to forget.
I appreciate the dinner but I'm still not certain that I'm ready for a one knight stand!
Martha, Sometimes a suit of armour is just a suit of armour.
It's the standard uniform for cabinet members when dining out these days.
Let's skip the drinks... I can't wait to get you out of that suit!
Oh, you're Jewish? I wondered why this knight was different from all other knights,"
You look exactly like your picture .
Yeah? Well I think that underneath that cold, hard exterior lies a cold, hard interior.
I wanted you to feel like a princess.
Well, you dropped your shield, but I still feel that I don't know you.
When you said, "a night out,"  I had something different in mind.
When you’re part of this administration, you have to remain incognito at restaurants.”
Darn autocorrect...I meant to type "Date Night"
Frustrating yes, but more effective than A.A.
It's been ages since my last date too.
What makes you say I have vulnerability issues?
I just can’t get through to you anymore, Lance
My other suit is at the cleaners.
Can I get a straw?
The dating service never mentioned a one-knight stand.
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur. Why isn't it ever Lancelot?
I usually avoid blind dates, but my therapist says I need to let down my guard.
Well, this is not the knight I expected.
So…how was the tournament?
Thanks, but I slay my own dragons.
I am guessing that your previous experiences with online dating have not been positive.
I also believe in safe sex but this is going a bit too far.
I said EMOTIONAL armor.
Your profile said you were looking for amour
You're a lot shinier in person.
I hate it when you get so defensive.
I have a drinking problem.
You probably wonder what I do.
I think you’ll need a straw.
I thought the protection you were bringing would be more flexible
It's been ages since my last relationship.
I'm also emotionally guarded
Your profile mentioned you were a little rusty at this...
Another Knight to forget.
Are you still errant or in town for a while?
I understand you're into heavy metal.
Knight takes Queen
You need to learn to be less defensive.
This was not the knight I had in mind.
This isn't the first time I've had a memorable night at a round table.
I don't think it'll work out for us ... Not that I don't appreciate a guy who uses protection, though!
Sorry if I seem a little defensive ...
You said on Tinder that you came with a horse.
I know we said we’d take it slow, but I wish you’d make an effort to open up to me.
I think you need to update your profile picture.
No, nothing in my profile is “just an expression.”
So you weren't just being cute when you called yourself  a knight in shining armor on your dating profile?
Oh, I thought you said Cruise.   I have not been on a Crusade.
I really only wanted a man to pull out my chair for me.
...and our prenup will have to be ironclad.
It just feels like we are from different eras.
I’m not sure why, but I’ve been told that I should let down my guard more.
You have your emotional armour, and I’ve got mine
Not what I had in mind when I said I wanted a night out.
Now I see why you wanted me to reserve a round table.
It says in your bio you like horses?
I should have asked for details when you said you enjoyed the "nightlife".
I presume that you're a virgin.
This is the last time I post, “Looking for my knight in shining armor”.
So tell me, why is this knight different from all other knights?
I didn't fully appreciate what this place meant by 'Date Knight'
Henry, do you have to do this every time we go to Round Table Pizza...and quit calling me Guinevere.
You call that "shining?"
In these times, one has to develop a tough exterior.
I wish you would open up to me someday.
I knew Galahad. Galahad was my friend. You,sir, are no Galahad.
I'm sorry if I misled you, but I'm looking to be joust friends.
Susan realized too late that she severely misunderstood "Speed Dating Knights"
So, you agree, you have put up some barriers to intimacy.
So, do you take the armor off before, during, or after?
My social skills are a little rusty.
I brought protection
You might need a straw
Father did always say to wear protection.
Well, I did promise you a knight to remember.
How about a knight cap?
If you think this is bad, wait until you see my emotional armor.
It’s just so hard to get people to let their guard down these days.
This is not what I meant when I said I want a night out!
I haven't dated in years so, yes, you're going to encounter some rust here and there.
So, tell me your feelings about protected sex.
You seem really guarded this evening.
You seem a little defensive tonight
Why do you always request a round table?
It’s been a while since I’ve been out with anyone.  I might be a bit rusty.
Do you have to insist on the round table every time?
I meant figuratively, not literally.
It's a very scary time for young men.
I didn't mention it in my profile because people are so quick to judge.
Oh...your profile meant verbal jousting...that makes more sense.
Really?  All of this just for a "Sir Loin" joke?
Is that your lance?
... and that then led to a regional manager position at Medieval Times.
You're the one being defensive!
I should have said I wanted a "day" out on the town.
What? You asked for a knight out.
There are other ways to quit drinking.
I can’t bear to get hurt again.
I thought you worked FOR Under Armour
I think you greatly misunderstood your sex education teacher.
Call me old fashioned, but I think a guy should dress up for a first date.
Why should I think that this night is different from all other nights?
I just feel like everyone has their guard up on first dates.
I'm sensing that you're a bit defensive
I was the Op-Ed Writer.
This is the only suit I own
Ha ha.  Let me guess.  Date knight?
I thought 'Take a nice knight out.' was a typo.
Did you just say, "Oil can"
I meant that we should talk about your emotional armor.
Your bio said I am in for a knight I will never forget."
I asked for more Chianti, not Quixote.
You don't need to be so defensive all the time.
"I hate the plume."
If you want this to go anywhere, you're going to have to drop your guard.
Are you going to put the visor down every time I start talking?
This week has felt like an absolute battle.
You really need to open up, Bob.
M'thinks we need to see other people...
Nice try, but I can see right through you....
Another boring knight out.
Who does your rivets?
Chivalry schivalry, we're splitting the check.
You need a straw?
Well Brett, your backstory seems ironclad.
Are you going to open up or shall I ask for a straw?
Well I think it has a metallic aftertaste.
Your voice message said you wanted a fun knight out on the town!
So, I’m guessing safe sex isn’t an issue
 with you.
You're probably used to a round table.
So this is how men are protecting themselves against Me Too?
When you said you were looking for a lady with polish ...
Well, it's better than last Halloween when you went as a corpse.
I hear the dragon is excellent!
It’s just that I thought you were referring to ‘emotional armor’ in your dating profile.
Well, you don’t exactly look like your profile picture either.
I got hurt pretty bad when my last relationship ended.
Enjoying date knight?
My last date said I was a little too guarded.
First knight jitters?
I'm sorry, it's just that this isn't what I was expecting when you said you were a little "old fashioned."
I must say, this isn't quite what I imagined when your dating profile described you as a renaissance man"
So, um ... who does your plume?
OK, I'm ready. Tell me what you thought of my play.
It's my favorite kind of table too.
Kudos on your thoughtfulness, but I think you missed the nuance in 'I expect you to wear protection.'
I guess the dating site takes your requests pretty literally.
I thought you'd be younger.
I think we should see other people. It's been fun, but we've never seen eye-to-eye.
Would it kill them to bring me a straw?
When you said you worked in court I didn't picture this.
When I asked “do you use protection”...
That ridiculous suit of armor doesn't prove chivalry isn't dead, but it does prove that you're an idiot.
Honestly Harold, I didn't mean that suit.
This dump again? Of all the knights in the kingdom I had to pick Sir Tightwad.
Darling,would you please ask the waiter for a straw.
Enjoyed your ad, though I assumed ''knight'' was a typo.
You could ask for a straw.
I’m just used to much larger round table.”
No, you smile first.
Chivalry is not dead, just tired
So tell me-- how long have you had the nickname "Rusty"?
No, honey, I said date NIGHT.
Is this going to be a good knight or a bad knight?
As my profile says, I'm into heavy metal.
I know you prefer round tables, but I'd prefer a booth.
Your logic is ironclad.
So, do you like jousting?
Seriously?
I know my profile said "seeking knight in shinning armor" but I was hoping for a little more shine and a little less armor.
You don't look like your profile pic.
After my divorce, my friends say  I've been a bit guarded.
Don’t you think your “anonymous reviewer” disguise is going too far?
Check, mate.
My ad said I enjoy verbal jousting.
Must the table always be round?
Your armor isn’t as shiny as your profile pic.
Well, this certainly makes it harder to determine if you’re really 45.
I'll show you what’s under mine if you show me what ’s under yours,
You do realize, that when I said in my profile I wanted to meet my knight in shining armor, that was just a figure of speech, don't you?
Marcie considered the empty flea market suit of armor quietly rusting across the table from her and concluded that this was neither the best blind date nor the worst.
Yes, I DID have to reserve a round table.
Right…so you ARE a knight and this IS a round table.”
My profile clearly says I tend to be a little protective.
Really Ted, there’s no need to be so defensive.
Do we have to sit at a round table?
I know love is a battlefield, but was this really necessary?
My Mama said there'd be knights like this.
Long walks on the beach are actually a bit difficult, but I do like piña coladas.
Pillage here often?
Date knight? 
So you're a professional pun?
Thank goodness!  You look just like your picture!
Our problem is that I'm a morning person and you're a knight person.
Well you're the one who said I should be more armorous!
You're not very open are you?
You looked shinier in your pictures.
The dating site DID promise a night to remember."
I suppose this is a knight I'll never forget.
I appreciate this Jerry, but what would you have done if I'd asked you to be my Rock?
I never go on a date without protection.
I detect metallic notes.
I thought you promised me a “night” I wouldn’t forget.
Well, at least there won't be any awkward good night kiss business.
When I said I wanted a night out on the town, this wasn't what I had in mind.
Is this your idea of a date knight?
With a disapproving glance, Roy's date let him know he'd chosen the wrong suit for the evening.

You’re acting very defensive tonight.
I've been told I'm emotionally guarded.
I have a bigger round table back at my place.
Sorry I'm late, I came straight from my knight class.
Not your idea of a knight out?
Lately you seem so closed off.
I am NOT defensive!
I’m going as an accountant. You?
My ex-husband called me a battle ax, so yes, I think we are made for each other.
My psychologist says it's a defense mechanism.
I don't care if the "knight is young" but I'd rather go home now.
You say you are a Supreme Court nominee?
"Lest this first date be also the last I wouldst now see thee raise thy glass and too thy visor, buddy boy."
Are you on guard with all women or just now that you are on the Supreme Court?
Because you told me to wear my best suit.
Let me guess.  This isn't your first online date!
Arthur, I think calling me defensive is your projection.
I admit that when I read your profile, I thought it was just an expression when you said you were a crusader.
It’s harder now that bars have stopped offering straws.
Why couldn't we just get a square table like everyone else?
Who says that chivalry is dead?
I wouldn’t have gone out with you if I’d known you were so defensive.
No need to be so defensive.
If you see the waiter again, ask for a straw?
So ask the damn waiter for a straw!
I'll keep drinking until you're shining.
Great time to ban straws...
They don't have straws here anymore.
See, Mildred, chivalry is NOT dead!
Don't give me that look.  You said you needed a knight out.
I thought you’d be shinier.
I'm always a little cautious on a first date."
You're not what I had in mind when I said I wanted a good night out.
Some people say I am a bit defensive.
Shirley was beginning to regret agreeing to date knight.
At that moment, she knew that metaphor was not her friend.
I think we ought to call it a knight.
The dating scene these days is a real battlefield.
You look just like your picture
Yes, it comes in High Shine and also in Matte finish.
Shut your face!
Your armor isn't as shiny as it is in your profile.
“Je t'aime mon armor”
My profile clearly stated that I’m looking for amour ... NOT ARMOR!
Doris always preferred a quiet date knight.
Chivalry might not be dead, but this date is.
After this glass of wine, maybe we can go back to my place for a knight cap.
You seem very guarded!
People often tell me I’m too guarded on first dates.
Nice suit, but ties are required.
No, Harold, we're not getting a warhorse.
Well you don't look anything like your picture either"
Where I come from, it's not considered presumptuous to bring protection on a first date.
Is this what you meant by knightcap?
I said I wanted a night in Ann Arbor!
It has notes of apricot and fig, with just a hint of tin and zinc"
Wow, we're both into 17th century British poetry!
Your profile said the armour would be shining.
Honestly, from your profile I expected a bit more luster.
Maybe I do say "literally" too often.
Dr. Weintraub said I needed better psychological armor. But we settled for this.
What? It's my best suit!
You're late.
I feel safer in it since that whole Kavanaugh thing.
One can not be too careful when ordering steak flambe.
It was supposed to be a metaphor.
First date in a long while?
I hate date knight.
So if you're up on your tetanus shots, I was thinking we could head back to my place...
Damned auto-correct - my Tinder post  was for an exciting night
I understand from your profile that you're a little shy.
You say "armor," I say "amore."
What do you say we take this to my place for a Knight-cap
Damn spellcheck. Next time I will say "evening" preferred.
I haven't been out in ages. Sorry if I'm a bit rusty.
Do we have to joust over the bill again?!
Well, my guard is up too, buddy.
I am wondering about your concept of safe sex.
If you say, "Mmpphhht uffa gishhes" one more time, I'm going to scream
Awfully defensive, aren’t you?
Don't think that after one glass of wine we'll be having a one-knight stand.
Why do we always have to dine at a round table?
I'm leaving you for someone shinier.
I assume you will be expecting a “good knight” kiss?
You might want to update your profile picture
Hope you didn't mind the long wait, but I only sit at round tables.
So, what do you do when you're not jousting?
I hear you, but I still feel this is something of an overreaction to the #MeToo movement.
Do we always have to sit at this round table?
Marge decided then that this would be her last knight out.
Tannins? What tannins? I get subtle hints of face mask.
You don't look like your profile picture.
Sorry. I never joust on the first date.
You know, this isn't the first round table I've sat around.
No Frank, I am looking for "le grand amour"...
Frank, I said date NIGHT, not date knight.
Shall I ask the sommelier to bring you a straw?
This isn't what I  pictured  when you said "Date Knight"
Next time the dating app tells me "you've got mail"  I'll  take it more seriously.
Well I think you're being a little defensive.
Am I correct? You majored in medieval history.
I just like to hear you say ,'Good Night' and mean it.
I was hoping you would let your guard down this evening
Here's hoping for a knight to remember.
It's my response to the #MeToo movement.
You never shine it like you used to.
This isn't what I meant when I asked for a date night
Are you going to open up, or should I order you a straw?
I just feel like there's this barrier between us...
So you just sit at any round table you see?
My friend told me I should wear some protection.
What makes you say I'm guarded?
When is the food coming? We‘ve been waiting for centuries.
Would a straw help?
I have some battle scars from my last relationship.
Spell-check got it wrong. I wanted a unique night out
I don’t feel like being feudal tonight, Marty
Actually, when you called and asked, 'How about a knight on the town?', I misunderstood.
What makes you think I need rescuing?
I'm not wearing underpants.
I'm squeaking.  Order something oily.
Well, people use to say I was too thin-skinned.
I thought you said you liked old-fashioned guys
I’m just saying, a real knight in shining armor would’ve asked if I preferred the Chardonnay.
It’s not me, it’s you.
I want a divorce.
I wish you’d let your guard down.
Mama told me to use protection when I started dating."
I'm not sure this is working out, Rupert.  I sense a little defensiveness.
The 80's called, Karen. They want their shoulder pads back.
I’m just not ready to commit to a relationship that includes a horse.
Well you are wearing something different from your online profile picture, too.
Rook to queen bishop 4, unless you have other moves in mind.
What do you think of heavy metal?
Margaret, I wish you could just see past my defenses.
Alice said that it’d be a knight to remember. I wish that she’d said it in writing.
I think I'm taking a shine to you
So basically, you’ll get chivalry back, and I’ll get to own all the land and tax everyone.
I should have asked for a straw.
My name is Galahad but my friends call me Rusty.
A knight cap - I know what you’re thinking.
I mean, no one’s dating profile is perfectly accurate.
I know you have a problem with showing your true self but I thought you meant emotionally...
If you don't want to be seen with me, there are other ways.
You know, if this relationship is ever going to work, you need to let your guard down.
Chivalry is not dead. It's being re-enacted.
I've dated guys with emotional walls but, this is ridiculous.
No , not really. You don't seem all that unhinged to me.
Sorry Martha, I cheated on you!
Some people reminisce about the days of yore.  I do something about it.
I used to be much more guarded.
Go ahead, ask the sommelier. I’m telling you 1297AD was NOT a very good year.
Every time I bring this up you get so defensive.
When I said I was interested in the Renaissance I really just meant the art.
And I thought chivalry was dead.
Not that kind of crusade.
So… I can remove it on the 3rd date?
It's fine. You're just less shining than your photo.
Frankly, you looked shinier on Tinder.
I don't normally brag, but I'm kind of a Rennaisance man.
I told you they wouldn't have straws here.
Sticks and stones my ass.
It’s nothing personal.   It’s just that my ISO ad was for a Renaissance man.
something tells me this is going to be a one knight stand.
It's hard for me to catch the waiters' eye, could you ask for a straw?
Where I come from, this is business casual
Keep the lance down,Trevor.
Nobody ever remembers my face but they always remember my name..
M'lady, what, pray, is a "Medieval Dickweed"?
auto correct changed 'where's your email' to 'wear your mail?'
Long thought dead, Chivalry returns to the dating scene.
Bad hair day again Edna
This isn't what I was expecting when I read that you liked heavy metal in your profile.
So when your profile said "man of steel" you weren't kidding.
Your armor was shinier in your profile picture.
“Besides Dungeons and Dragons what else do you do for fun?”
You're afraid they'll recognize you from what incident?
This isn't my first one knight stand
When will you come out?
My profile did promise a knight to remember.
Do yoou need a straw?
I was hoping you'd agree to a one-knight stand with me ...
No, really. I want to hear about YOUR day.
Should I order a straw for you?
I'm weating a chastity belt in the same color
You  tweeted for a knight to remember.
I said I was looking for Mr. RIGHT.
Not bad, but I prefer the blood of my enemies
I'm afraid I have a hard time letting my guard down.
So then King Arthur says, “how many knights does it take to change a light bulb?”
It's just been so long since I had a knight out
See?  They DID have a round table!
Are you still seeing Lance?"
It’s a dangerous time to be a young male in America.
which personal pronoun do you prefer?
And, as for me, I can be somewhat defensive.
Didn't you say you wanted a knight out?
Of all the things to ban, it had to be straws.
I'm guessing you've been wounded by past speed-dating experiences.
To be honest, when I posted on TINDR for a Knight in Shining Armor, I had Jon Hamm in mind.
Your profile said you were taller.
Jeff Flake at dinner.
How long has it been since you've had a knight out?
I thought you'd be on a horse.
We'll do a gender reveal when the check comes.
Sorry, when it comes to blind dates, I'm a little rusty.
So then-you’re not gonna believe this-the kid actually pulls the sword out of the stone!
Damn auto-correct for a romantic knight with protection."
Sorry... I left my wallet in my other armor
#metoo really got you spooked, huh?
Sorry, I can already tell this won’t be a knight to remember.
Chivalry IS dead. I'm just cosplaying.
Can you wait just a minute while I slip into something more comfortable?
Too much?
YOU can ask the waiter for a straw!
Online dating always feels so feudal to me.
It’s been six years, Marvin. The ‘I’m your knight in shining armor’ thing is getting old.”
Rita suddenly realizes her fairy godmother has taken her wish literally.
I never said it'd be THE Round Table.
My date next week?  A scarecrow apparently.
I was expecting more than one knight at the round table...
I'm so glad they could give us a round table
When you said you would have to show up in your work clothes, I wasn't expecting this.
Your argument that chivalry isn’t dead is oddly compelling.
First, I'd like to hear about the knightly specials.
Just because you're A knight in shining armor doesn't make you MY knight in shining armor.
No. I don’t believe it’s a “scary time” for men.  Check please!
Defensive? What makes you think I'm defensive?
Tonight's the Knight
Did you know that the Middle Ages were really called the Dark Ages because there were too many knights?
My last Crusade also went poorly.
Now I know why your nickname is Rusty.
I can see you took my dating profile quite literally.
Are you jousting me?
So.......joust much?
So you seem to be a little rusty at this speed dating thing.
I've been craving a nice knight out on the town.
I’m just working on my knight moves.
You always get so guarded when we talk about your childhood
The dress code here is casual, not chivalrous.
It’s a dangerous time to be a young man.
Wow, Scott, you take #ThrowBackThursdays to a whole new level.
I bet you're one of those guys who feels weird about taking their socks off too.
Must you clank with each sip?
Your were shinier on Tinder
You haven't touched your wine.
Well, I did wish for a memorable night.
Note to self, remove "attracted to men in suits" from my profile.
But Brett, you could have ordered beer.  As you say, ‘Everybody likes beer,’ and no one will recognize you in that get-up.
So what happened after you and the Lady of the Lake broke up?
I didn't know Brooks Bros. had a blacksmith's shop.
Do you mind if I finish your wine?
Mom, there’s something you should know about me.
Thank you again for requesting a round table.
Maybe my profile put a little too much emphasis on chivalry.
What do you mean, "I'm emotionally unavailable"?
When I asked you to bring protection I was referring to condoms!
You're my first date knight ever.
I still think make-up would cover that birthmark.
I dub thee Sir Merlot-a-lot.
Well, you said you wanted a knight to remember.
Love is a battlefield.
I think I've been taking too many iron supplements.
I know. I know. The round table was so much bigger back then.
How do you feel about long walks on the beach?
Sorry, but I 'm thinking this may only be a one-knight stand.
This is my first knight out in a long time.
My doctor told me to always use protection
You look nothing like your profile picture
So, Lance, just exactly, how long have you and this... this Guinevere person been seeing each other?
So, are you having a good 'knight' so far? Ha ha ha.....sorry, joust joking!
Sorry, I know I can be a little guarded on a first date.
oil can
oil can
oil can
I, on the other hand, am feeling rather vulnerable.
I never bring a can opener on the first date.
Your profile said you were guarded, but...
Nothing will get through to you.
You got yourself into that mesh, you can get yourself out.
I thought Sir Lancelot was just your screen name
When I said I was looking for a knight in shining armor, I meant it metaphorically.
All I can think of is that the tin man didn't have a heart.
Just so we're clear, there will be no castling queenside.
But it's vintage WD-40.
You look a lot different in person, actually.
I get lubricated about once a week....
Would it be wrong for me to admit that I'm imagining you naked?
Let me explain what I meant by "date night."
I enjoy long walks on the beach at sunset, candlelit dinners, and jousting.
This is not what I meant when I asked you to be more chivalrous.
I am a bit old-fashioned.
I'm glad we went with the round table.
Think of me as being a lot like a lobster dinner...
So, you want to get medieval tonight?
Glad you picked an Italian place--I only eat spaghetti.
Have you had difficult first dates before?
Is that proposal iron-clad?
The K is silent
In hindsight, it may have been a bad idea to schedule this date on laundry day.
It's always so hard to let your guard down on first dates.
Does it chafe?
I’m too old for you, Jill.
What I’m really looking for is someone who’s emotionally available. You?
All right, so why are we feeling vulnerable this time?
I can see myself in you.
That thing I said on my dating profile was just a figure of speach.
You can wear that for the rest of your life, but I'm still not watching Game of Thrones with you!
So you're a knight of the round table and still live with your parents?
I said night cap.
Well do you have any interest in verbal jousting?
Perhaps a little jousting could break the ice.
Well, this hasn't exactly been a night to remember for me, either.
I hope you’re not drinking and jousting!
Wow, this is a first—you look the same in person as you did on Tinder.
Date knights just aren't what they used to be.
Can you hear me now?
After years of online dating, Norma figured anything was better than another knight home alone.
It's just..."
"I know."
"I mean...on the phone..."
"Yes, I know."
"I mean, when you said Knight School I assumed...
When was the last time you got a shine?
And even dressed like that Trump still grabbed you by the 
p_ _ _y?
My Knight in dining armor!
Would you like me to ask the waiter for a bendy straw?
Your profile said, "Damsel in distress seeks her knight in shining armor...?
I'm pretty sure that in your dating profile, you spelled 'night-owl' without the 'k'.
I thought you said it was date knight!
Oh? So look who's calling me defensive!
So, this is your idea of a knight cap.
I can't help but feeling you have your guard up since your divorce.
You asked for a date knight.
No. I'm not in distress and, no, you can't join me.
I know I asked for a "date knight", but ...
I was hoping you'd order the Sir Loin.
I'm into safe sex.
Let's just leave it at 'knight and day', you aren't the one.
I said I wanted a night with amour ...
Well...this will be the last time I use checkmate.com...
You must be from the rust belt, right?
Ar you always this defensive?
I thought you said you wanted to meet someone with mettle.
So you don't recommend the sword fish ?
Sorry, sorry. Your profile did say, 'A Knight in Shining Armour,' I - well - I just didn't take it that literally that's all.
So what brings you to the middle-age mixer?
I take safe sex very seriously!
I like jousting, shining my armor and killing small animals with my sword.  And you?
You’re so guarded. I just really don’t know how to get through to you.
I'm assuming the waitress will come back with a straw...
It's bullet-proof, arrow-proof, cannon ball-proof, water-proof, snake proof, AND I can use either men's or women's bathroom.
I can tell what you're thinking--my armor was shinier in the profile picture.
I think the “shining armor” thing is a metaphor
I find the wine has a metallic finish.
I think you're afraid of letting your guard down
It was amour at first sight.
I told you, chivalry isn't dead.
I warned you that I have a pretty exciting knight life.
Doesn't matter, I'm going to hurt you with my words
I'm getting metallic notes.
Fiscal liberal, social conservative
Welcome to the Supreme Court secretarial staff. You'll need to get your grope-free armor before you start on Monday.
Too bad they phased out straws.
Thanks for agreeing to meet me right after work.
I have to be honest, when it comes to dating I tend to put my guard up.
My divorce was brutal.
Anything happen at work today ?  You seem rather guarded.
Every anniversary I feel deeper regret that we got married on Halloween.
It's a scary time to be a man today.
Now I understand why your profile says you are a knight person.
Just my luck, I've got mail.
You're the one who wanted the round table!
I’ll see if they can get you a straw.
What a knight.
I just got off work and didn't have time to change.
I don't care, I'm asking for a straw.
I really miss straws.
Do you notice a strong metallic aftertaste?
If you see the waiter, can you ask him to bring me a straw?
I use protection
You look different from your profile picture.
Early into the small talk Julie sensed this was going to be an awkward kinght
It's only a pimple.
I thought your online, 'Knight in Shining Armor' shtick was a come on.
Round Table for two.
Is it awkward in here or is it me?
A straw? Really, Harold?
I'll tell the waiter 'check, mate.'
Why are you being so guarded?
Apologies, m’lady, I’m a little rusty.
You have a beautiful smile.
I’ve always preferred the metaphor.
You know I meant "knight in shining armor" figuratively, right?
Now, tell me, are you a dark and stormy knight?
I thought you were looking for a Renaissance man.
No, my mighty stallion wasn't a metaphor.
You look shinier in person than on Tinder.
I'm glad we don't have to use chopsticks.
What, not shining enough for you?
Why so defensive Bill?
There will be no jousting tonight.
the dog's dead; the scarecrow had a stroke, the lion's still a wimp, and you've hidden my oil can again.  I think it's time we called it quits.
I think you misunderstood when I said I wanted a night out.
You know knight in shining armor is just a metaphor, right?
I always thought of Middle Age as a state of mind...
Same way as when nature calls. Why do you ask?
Did you lie about your age on Match.com?
Does my handsome knight in shining armor need a straw?
I always bring protection on dates... just in case.
You could always ask the waitress for a straw
Finally, a quiet knight out.
Chivalry may be dead, but I still find the attire surprisingly comfortable.
It's a dangerous time to be a man.
Why do you say I always keep my guard up?
When my friend said you worked at a museum, I thought maybe you were a tour guide.
I find your attitude quite cavalier.
It was much shinier in your Profile Photo.
Maybe the bartender has a straw.”
Day off at the museum?
I was hoping for a little more "Shining" and a little less "Armor."
Personally, I believe your story, but I can only rescue damsels who have a corroborating witness.
Maybe it was a mistake to take our Role-playing public.
I have to confess, I wasn't completely honest in my profile pic.
Don't be so defensive.
I guess this wasn’t the night either of us had in mind.
A straw would be nice.
I am generally cautious on my first dates.
Just so you know, I don't want to have kids.
Well this won't be a knight to remember.
I'm vulnerable.
But I don't care about the difference in our ages.
Back to your castle for a knight-cap? I don't think so.
Why are you so defensive?
Run out of clean clothes?
It was hard to find a women's helmet that allowed my pony tail through
First Knight out?
Middle Age
I thought it was misspelling when it read, ".....for a knight to remember."
Be careful of what you wish for.
You don't happen to have a straw, do you?
So...when ya from?
My ex wasn't of the highest calibur.
Lance, I know it's a round table, but really...
Another awkward first date at the Holy Bar & Grail
It's not your opinion on the divine rights of kings that's the dealbreaker.  It's your take on the usefulness of heavy cavalry in the age of the machine gun that is really hurtful.
So they're telling me chivalry is dead.
I think I'm gonna need a straw.
I thought chivalry was dead.
No offence but my date match description said I enjoyed a good NIGHT with a glass of wine.
So, do you ever sit at square table?
I thought you said this was dress casual.
This is nice.  I haven't had a knight out in quite a while!
Well, my profile did say ‘Renaissance Man’.
Is this your first date with another woman?
Do you think he forgot my straw?
I prefer it over the house arrest.
Sorry, I'm a little rusty at this
It's a round table.
I'm not getting you a straw
I asked the Genie for a knight in shining armor who turns into a stallion in the bedroom. Shall we order some sugar cubes ?
Your Silver Singles profile mentioned nothing about liking heavy metal.
I was hoping to catch you off guard.
My profile's ideal man? I was using an analogy.
And here I thought 'respond to my emaille address' was just a typo.
If it's alright with you, let's start the role play after dinner.
I just have always been more of a knight person.
I am keen to get out there and really open up to someone.
I guess my ordering a rusty nail wasn't funny
You did reserve the round table, right?
And I was so hoping to break the cycle of dating guarded men
Would you say you're more of a Lance-a-lot or a Lance-a-little?
Most of my friends thought that just a condom would be fine but I thought I might need to take it to the next level.
I'm not calling you sir.
Didst thy ad not sayeth 'Woman Seeking Renaissance Man'?
I'm just a little surprised because you weren't wearing a helmet in your profile picture.
I'm just out here, looking for my damsel in distress.
It's just not... shining.
This is taking 'wear protection on the first date' a little too far!
If you don't want a kiss, just say so!
I expected something different from "a night on the town."
You won't need all that protection. I have a chastity belt.
After my divorce, friends said I should get right back up on that horse. What's your story?
I'm waiting for the right woman to let my guard down.
Thank you, but I'm no longer in distress.
Dammit Bill, just because it's a round table doesn't mean you to have dress up.
It's my defense mechanism.
You really should learn to let your guard down
My chastity belt is in the shop.
Is it me, or does this wine have a metallic aftertaste?
Chivalry is still dead.
So, this is the big deal round table you've been bragging about!
I'm sorry, but I was speaking metaphorically in my ad.
Brett, you've been confirmed.  I think you can relax now.
My profile was supposed to read that I enjoyed "nights" along with a glass of wine.
Guess who’s going commando?
Maybe next time we could go somewhere less formal.
Gladys was determined to have a good knight.
My friends were right, they told me this wasn’t going to be my knight.
Nasty divorce?  Something tells me you're not ready to start dating again.
I have a problem with trust.
So this is your idea of a night to remember?
You said there'd be dragons.
So, you say your hobbies are archery and bird watching? Surely you joust!
I don't know about the damsel part, but you do seem in distress."
But your ad said, "Wanted, knight in shining armor..."
You looked younger online.
It was worth the wait, to get this round table.
Mainly, I wear it to save on dry cleaning.
This is not what I meant by wining and dining with a night on the town.
Ohh, that type of Renaissance man.
Well, at least you don’t pretend to be open and available.
... maybe you should open up more?
It's time that we open up to one another.
It's not your shielding, Herm, it' your emptiness.
Did you specifically ask for a round table"
You seem a little too guarded, even for a first date.
This was your idea. Don’t you dare ask for a straw.
I'm always a little shy on first​ dates too.
No, I'm not going to ask them for a straw.
Well, hash tag Sir Lancelot, you certainly fooled me.
It seems like I haven't dated since the dark ages...  I have to admit I'm a bit rusty.
In a couple of weeks, Senator Cruz, this #MeToo thing will all blow over.
The last time I let down my walls? They stormed the castle.
Darling, now we can talk about your mother!
I take it this is your way of telling me you're afraid of commitment.
This explains the part in your profile about an interest in Heavy Metal.
But your online profile said you liked hard bodies!
No problem, I never kiss on the first date anyway.
You'll have to excuse the echo.
I find it hard to let my guard down on a first date
Sorry, it’s not going to work. You’re tarnished.
I know I SAID I was searching for my knight in shining armor!
Marvin,  he has no idea what “fercula dant meliora“ means. Just ask to see the menu.
And I thought my ex had emotional armor.
You don't have to be so defensive !
Well, the part of your profile about the shining armor was right.
I was hoping this knight would be special.
Check, please.
Your overt display of chivalry has been duly noted.
joust a gigolo!
You look a lot older than on your Tinder profile.
I did the chain mail thing, but that was before I really knew myself.
I've always thought that "clothes make the man."
I'm a bit of a germophobe.
Actually I thought you said amour not armor...
No problem, I'll just drink it for you.
Am I not your knight in dining armor?
So... what do you do for work?
It’s important for me to feel safe on a first date.
I could ask the waiter for a straw for you!
"In your profile picture, your armor was shining.
I must warn you. I'm feeling a little chivalrous tonight.
This is not what I meant by a night to remember.
I though you said you worked the night shift.
This is not quite what I meant when I said I needed a night out.
No, I said I wanted a night out.
I dunno Arthur, I guess I just need some me time.
So,I guess in your dating profile, "S.W.M" meant  " surrounded with metal"?
Yes, I know it's not shining, but I can change.
When I said men were stuck in the Middle Ages when it came to women’s rights, I didn’t mean literally.
You know, you're not the first woman to tell me I have intimacy issues.
You're taking the 'wear protection' advice very seriously.
Your cross-dressing I've patiently lived with George... but this?
It's not my fault, you're the one who told me to bring protection.
Well, I did suggest a Knight-cap
Drink up.  You're due back at the museum.
Ok, but no lube jobs til the 3rd date.
As long as your house really is a castle, I'm good.
The ad said "Speed Dating Saturday Knight" ...I thought it was a typo
Looks like you've been watching a lot of Fox News lately...
They always keep the round table open just for me.
I'm not taking any chances this flu season.
Frankly, I think the 1795 Lafite Rothschild has a better finish.
Well,you did ask for a knight out"
Would you stop being so defensive, Lionel!
I thought Sharon said "a date night" not "date a knight."
We’re breaking up? Your text said you wanted to be joust friends. You need to get a handle on your autocorrect, Linda.
C’mon. I was just jousting.
When I asked for a night out on the town, I had something else in mind.
No, chivalry isn't dead, just hungry
Your profile said you were looking for someone with a tough exterior.
I guess I misunderstood what you meant by date night
My profile specifically said I’m not into one Knight stands...
I promised you a knight out.
I know I wrote "treat me like a Queen" on my Tinder profile but this is ridiculous.
Dianne, you are seriously underdressed.
I just gave up on make-up.
If the Tinman could get a heart, so can you.
A round table at the Olive Garden. My my. And they said chivalry was dead.
I think this is a nonstarter.
I just find it difficult to really reach you
When I said I'd like a night out on the town...
I’m in transition.
Let's skip the romance and find out what's under that hard exterior shell.
I thought you said your therapist was getting you to shed your armor.
I'd like to think that I project a strong exterior.
I remember the middle ages differently.
Defensive? How so?
So that makes you the lady of the knight.
You looked a lot younger in your picture
You told me to wear my suit.
Knight out at the round table.
I'm not the old Gwen; give it up, Arty.
Perhaps you misread my online profile, I promised a great knight.
Karen thought her dinner date was being overly defensive.
Is this your first time steed dating?
Unless there's a woman under there, you're outta luck!
Is this going to be a knightly thing?
You know, they've stopped serving straws.
A brunch in shining armor is just stupid.
The MeToo movement has me feeling a little guarded.
So, you work in government?
Sit still. I'll go get you a straw
Not what I meant by a night out.
What makes you say that I'm looking for a fight?
No, not shining.  But it is armour.
Ironically, I am more of a morning person.
Are you going to take off your helmet or should I ask the waiter for a straw?
I don't know the meaning of the word 'Ni!'
Okay, so now are you ready to talk about the kids?
I thought you asked for a good knight out.
You don’t look anything like your photo.
It's the only suit I own.
I'll take off my glasses if you take off your head.
You meant literally
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I wanted a night out.
I didn't think it was going to be this kind of night.
You're taking this #Me Too thing to seriously, Bernie.
The waiter said he'd bring a straw.
I really needed a knight out on the town.
I am sorry to learn you've been hurt before.
No problem.  I brought the WD-40.
At least you're not another Neanderthal...
I love the chivalry, but I wish you could be more vulnerable.
So, how do you know Linda?
If you're so worried about stains, don't order red wine.
Another date knight who won’t let his guard down.
Would I undercut my whole chivalry thing if I asked to cleave the bill in two?
I see you also like to wear suits.
Want me to ask the waiter for a straw?
Perhaps you misunderstood my request for' a night out on the town' .
How is this knight different from all other nights?
I didn’t have time to change after work.
Chivalry is dead.  Let’s split the check.
I think it's overkill... I'm sure Maxine Waters doesn't even know you dine here Senator!
You may need to get a straw.
It's a shame you can't get a straw anymore.
You do realize it echoes when you cut the cheese?
I requested a round table.
Methinks, too.
Can we skip the pleasantries and get on to the jousting?
“So what other chivalric acts do you perform when you’re not asking for separate checks?”
This being the third date, and getting positive signals from Alice, Wally thought it best to wear protection.
Emotionally available I see.
Perhaps you missed the metaphor in my online profile.
I think a flu shot would be more practical.
You're very chivalrous, but I'm still not going back to your castle.
WHO hurt you so bad?
Why so stiff?
The wine has metallic notes.
These first date rituals are simply medieval.
Well, yes, I will admit that this blind date has given me a knight I will always remember.
I have to be honest. You look nothing like your profile picture.
Your dating profile noted that you are looking for a man of steel
Well, your Tinder profile didn't mention glasses. So...
I'm not happy either that they stopped serving straws.
I don't care if you are a knight in shining armor.  If you voted for Trump, I'm out of here.
My voice message was that I wanted a "good night" drink.
Okay, so now I realize what you meant by a "knight on the town."
Sometimes I think I was better off with the dragon.
I’m not looking for a one night stand.
Straw?
You said your favorite movie was "You've Got Mail."
Let's just try to enjoy the knight
I’m not looking for just one knight.
Oh, I thought your profile said you were looking for armor.
Geez, it's our third date. I think you can let your guard down now.
We need to talk about your defensiveness.
I would say that it has hints of dungeon mold, a bouquet of stagnant mote, and a rusty chain mail finish. Quite lovely, really.
I wish you would be a little more open about things
She did promise me it would be a "knight to remember"
Ugh,sure.  It'll be a knight to remember.
Sorry Guen, but according to our pre-nup, my position is iron-clad: I get to keep the castle.
I guess I thought your armor would be... shinier
Oil can.
#me too. You can't be too careful nowadays.
That's quite a riveting story.
Wine is fine, but I like beer.  I REALLY like beer.  Do you like beer?
So Lancelot, where you from?
As if your emotional armour isn’t bad enough.
Let's drink until knightfall.
Buddy, this is not what I had in mind for a one night stand.
Did you not ask for a knight on the town?
Yes, it may seem excessive.  But I, not you, am the woman who has to interview the new Supreme Court Justice.
Are you sure you don't want a straw?
It’s just...well frankly you looked a little shinier in your online profile.
You were shining more in the photo.
Nah mom, this is pretty standard law clerk dress code in DC these days
Would it be awkward if I used a straw?
This is the best Knight out I've had in a long time.
I told my husband  I had a night meeting but he’s suspicious...
I just wish you would make yourself a little more vulnerable with me."
A drinking problem? Why do you ask?
I want to see more of you, Claudia. But first I have to figure out how to open this visor.
If you don't stop calling me Guinevere, this date is over.
I'm tired of the verbal jousting.
I can see where the emojis confused things...
Of course the environment is important but I think they would understand if you asked for a straw.
Classical and metal. What’s your favorite music?
I'm sorry, this is not exactly what I had in mind when I requested a round table.
You got the 'knight in shining armor' part right, but how is 'walking barefoot on the beach' going to work
Sorry I was late, my horse ran out of grass on the way here.
I think you'll find that I'm way more chivalrous than most guys.
I loved your profile's emphasis on chivalry and old fashioned values.
Fine, I’ll stay for one drink... 
but it’s just not cool to post an old profile pic. 
It’s obvious you’re Middle Aged.
Sorry to hear you are suffering from metal fatigue
Ok, now I am ready to tell you how I honestly feel about our relationship.
I've got to find a more up-to-date dating service.
Stain resistant, never needs dry cleaning, small caliber bullet proof - what's not to like?
I thought you meant knight cap!
Since the nomination, they are flying off the rack.
My defenses are up.
I want to tell you who I'm voting for.
Shall we try a 13th century Cabernet?
I'm going to need you to let your guard down.
I did say no sex without protection, but isn't this a little extreme?
I don’t like to reveal my gender until the secon date.
You said formal attire.
You know I don't like round tables, Diana. I retired for a reason.
Is the ponytail too much?
It's just that I thought you would have been shinier.
I hate that they don’t give you straws anymore.
Cynthia considers options to avoid a goodnight kiss.
That I hide my feelings? Why do you say that?
Madame, there will be no need for your chastity belt tonight.
If we're going to sleep together, I think I should wear protection.
When I said I wanted a night out, this isn't what I meant...
I thought you meant date knight!
I'll say one thing for you, you are a knight in shining armor, the agency got that right
Knight time is the right time, get it?
What I said was, "Looking for a good night", but lets see where this goes.
Well, Kyle, if I knew you’d wear it on every anniversary, I’m not sure I would’ve said ‘yes’.
Oh, it helps me stick to my diet.........
I'm sensing a hint of blackberries with metallic overtones.
This is a first—you look the same as you did on Tinder.
You were the one who asked for a date knight.
The wine is just all right, the food is overpriced, but, Hey, a round table!
Sure, I'm a knight in shining armor. But nobody ever asks who I'm looking for.
I guess chivalry isn't dead.
So long story short you're looking for someone who will shine the armor.
_Maybe, we are taking this Knightcap thing a little too far
Sorry, using straws is against the law.
You do know "Knight in Shining Armor" is just an expression?
I'm trying not to be so defensive.
You did ask for something full-bodied.
Well, I said I was ready for a one night stand.
No, not particularly thin-skinned. Why do you ask?
I heard there is a high probability of golf ball size hail later tonight.
I'm not looking for anything longterm so I hope you're okay with a one knight stand.
Opening the door for me was enough.
Why do you always seem to be on the defensive?
It has a nice forward body, but the finish is a little metallic.
Well,at least the table is round.
I suppose you've heard every 'fun knight out' joke there is.
So when's your knight off?
Well, I wanted a night out on the town, and  you ARE a knight out on the town.
How long have you been on knights only dot com?
I'm a little behind on my credit card payments, but no, I wouldn't say I'm in distress.
'Knight in shining armor' is a euphemism, Scott.
I can't wait to see you try to drink that.
On our first date, I never expected a Knight like this.
Other women would kill to sit at the round table.
I sense you're feeling a bit defensive.
I'm through with "knights in shining armor." I'm moving on to "wealthy soulmates with Ferraris."
What? I thought you wanted a roundtable discussion, Linda
People tell me I'm a little closed off.
Well, aaaaactually, it's not a ponytail. It's called a "plume".
It's like they say. Dress for the job you want.
Your armor seemed shinier in your profile picture.
This doesn't even crack my top ten for weirdness.
I think I misunderstood you when you said Knight Club.
I can see it's a round table, but ...
Can I get you a straw?
Wouldst thou like a straw?
I'm sorry, I just don't feel any magnetism.
You looked shinier in your profile portrait.
A real knight never takes off his helmet until the third date.
So good to see the Age of Chivalry isn't dead.
It's okay, you're not the first women to realize I'm not *actually* what she's been waiting for all her life.
That sounds like a tough breakup, but I think you're being too guarded now.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little rusty.
And when is your coming out party?
Do you think they can get me a straw for this?
You make me feel so damned middle-aged.
This wasn’t exactly what I meant when I asked to be treated like a princess.
Mine doesn't have that metallic aftertaste.
I was given the option on the job application form to not reveal my gender, race and sexuality. I assume this option still applies for the interviews.
You wouldn't have a straw would you?
Oh don’t worry, the size of your lance does not matter, it is how you wield it.
You look so much better than your photo.
I hope you feel like you're in a safer space now.
I was hoping for a night of shining amour.
I’m torn between the swordfish and a nice piece of cod.
Well, Carol promised me a knight to remember.
I would love to see you again, but I just get the feeling you are shutting me out.
You go ahead....I'll wait for a straw
Is it just me, or are you somewhat shy?
I think it's time we moved beyond heavy polishing.
I though that 'Sir' was just your Nickname ...
They have Sir Loin here? Haven't seen him in ages."
So, what kind of Knight am I in for?
The pinot is nice, but I ordered the mead.
So, your name is Lance?
I'm not like those other princesses.
It's not you. It's me.
Your online dating profile said a “night “ to remember
Shinier in what way?
I sense that your response is rather guarded.
There would be fewer notes of tin and leather if you put up your visor.
I read in your bio that you like round tables.
Hey, it’s your fantasy.  You shine it.
And here I thought that "Knight in Shining Armor" was just your username.
Well, don't go getting all up in arms about it!
Should we ask for straw?
Nice romantic spot...See much of the Lion and Scarecrow these day?
The ban on straws is a real bummer for you, isn't it?
I'm sorry to tell you. Chivalry is dead
You look nothing like your pictures.
I wasn't told dating nights in my middle ages would be like this.
Was told you wanted a date knight.
Is this your first date on joust.com?
I agree that it's a very scary time in America for young men, but don't worry, I'm wearing my chastity belt.
Mi amor” does not mean “my armor”..
Tina, people wouldn't have wondered about two women dining alone.
My name's Bill.  But I'm changing it to Lance.
My hands are a disaster. Who does your mailles?
Raise the visor or our marriage is over
So, do you have many lonely knights?
Your choice of attire seems a bit defensive.  But then again you men are having a rough time right now.
Not what I really dreamed about.  It was just a metaphor.
Well, I promised you a knight on the town.
Well, yes, but I meant it figuratively.
Red wine with chicken? Surely you joust!
No, this is hardly my idea of the perfect knight out.
I don't know what I ever saw in you.
I hope you approve. There was a wait list for a round table.
I think you’re taking this knight in shining armor thing too far.
Wine makes me rust.
I thought Knight of the Round Table was just a cute line in your profile.
No, asking for a straw would seem weird.
Let me get this straight -- that wasn't a typo in your profile, AND you aren't a night person?
You said you had a drinking problem on your profile, but this isn't what I was expecting.
I'm guessing the whole 'knight in shining armor thing' was just a metaphor, right?
This isn't my first knight at a round table.
My armor’s called a “pantsuit.”
We could go play chess at my place.
I'm afraid my conversation skills are a little rusty.
"Renaissance man? I'm thinking Medieval."
I'm guessing coming back to my place is out of the question?
When your attorney said "there would be some jousting over the house," well, I just presumed............
Do you think this Beaujolais Nouveau has a metallic aftertaste?
I like your pony tail.
Just in case things go well I want you to know I'm  protected.
I asked for a quite NIGHT out.
We have to stop meading like this.
You said you wanted a knight in shining armor on your dating profile, what else were you expecting Sharon?
All right, perhaps I shouldn't have said in my posting that I still go wild for Heavy Metal.
Call me old fashioned, but I never raise my visor on a first date.
I said, show me a great night*...
You don't really look like your profile picture.
My anger management is going well, thank you.
The friend that set up this blind date said it would be a night to remember...another spell check failure
Truth be told, Roger, the lighting here makes you look medieval.
I’m getting notes of rust with a steely finish.”
I'm NOT too defensive!
So how do you get through metal detectors
Sorry I'm defensive.
I always get the knightly special.
This is not what I meant by one night stand.
You can drop your guard now.
It’s called wine. They haven’t served mead here in years.
I try and try and my captions never win!
It really isn't as difficult as you may think, if you help me down onto the floor I will be able to drink most of it.
I know it's a blind date, but you can uncover yourself now.
So I guess your profile was honest. You are an old fashioned gentleman in a modern world.
Why don’t you ever take me to Camelot?
Ignore them. They only stare because they‘re envious.
Is that the new Over Armour brand you are wearing?
Actually, I'm a morning person.
I see you still won't let your guard down.
I guess you weren’t lying in your profilewhen you said you were chivalrous.
Just ask the waiter for a straw.
I've decided to run for President of the United States.
Wouldn't it be easier to use hand sanitizer?
Some how when you said the strong, silent type, I had another impression.
'When I said I wanted a quiet night, this isn't exactly what I had in mind"
You said you wanted a knight out.
And you say chivalry is dead...
My friends told me that you were an old soul.
Have a sip. I’ll help you open up.
Something tells me you used a fake profile picture
I wanted a night off,not a knight out.
Will we be jousting at my place or yours?
You look different than your picture on Match.com
You're my first knight.
No worries. I like older men.
It's hard to feel close to you, Joan.
Where do you think the valet will put your horse?
I can’t even look at you anymore.
I didn't expect '...in shining armor' to be taken literally
When you described yourself as a “knight in shining armor,” I thought you were speaking metaphorically.
I suppose I could have clarified what I meant by "looking for a traditional relationship."
My Job? I’m currently on a quest, but the occasional pillage is rather lucrative
I get it. Date knight. Droll.
I thought it was date night, not date knight.
Tinder is the knight
No, I'm not a damsel, and no, I'm not in distress...
No, it's alright, I just didn't think this was what you meant by 'a night out on the town'
Well mom, there's a good reason Ed calls you a battleax.
I really think you've been touring with "Spam-a-lot" a bit too long.
Sorry.  This is California.  No straws.
I wasn't trying to start a fight, I just prefer a roundtable.
Hard day at work?
I wanted to talk about our sex life.
Just my luck!  I choose a “Man of Steel”, they send a “Knight in Rusty Armor!”
They forgot the bendy straw
Back off, Sir Handsalot!
When I requested a round table I was expecting something a little grander.
A Knight to Forget
I've hidden your oil can.
Don't worry, I don't unsheathe on the first date.
Should I ask for a square table for a change of pace?
I thought I mentioned my hobbies...
Not exactly my idea of a knight out on the town
Well, you were right! Mail enhancement has significantly improved my strength and confidence.
I don't feel like I'm getting through to you half the time.
Your profile picture must have been taken at a different angle.
Truthfully, I checked the online​ dating box for steel blue eyes.
This is what I get for joining TheeHarmony.
You can imagine what it's like having a name like Brett.
This isn't the knight cap I had in mind.
Your profile said you like chivalrous men.
You look vulnerable.
I've gotten a little rusty when it comes to dating.
Actually, it filters the wine perfectly
I just get the sense that you have your defenses up.
I know you wanted our first date to be old-fashioned, but this is a little extreme.
Sorry, I still don't understand the whole "smart-casual"  thing.
You wanted a round table, I got you a round table.
It's just that you take everything so literally.
This isn’t what I meant when I said I wanted a night out on the town
I only drink antioxidants.
I said date night, not date knight.
Sure, the table's round. But these aren't goblets and your armor barely shines.
Prithee, of what is this Tinder pic that you do speak of?
Hand sanitizer, might be a better way to go.
And here I thought chivalry was dead.
Tell me about your divorce.
Does the wine have a slight metallic taste to you?
Thine Tinder hadst moved me
I hope you brought your sword because we're splitting the check.
I  know they are frowned on, but I think you should try a straw.
Maybe a straw would help?
When I said “shut your face,” I didn’t mean for you to take it literally .
Pepper spray works for me.
Do you think it would be bad form to ask for a straw?
My horoscope said this would be a knight to remember.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted a night out on the town.
Are you sure I can't get you a straw?
Agincourt? You don't say. I served two tours in Afghanistan!
[incredibly loud farting noise amplified by metallic ass plate]
Perhaps I should have been more specific in my profile when I said I was looking for someone with 'old fashioned' sensibilities...
Shall I call you "dame" or "wench?"
You seem closed up tonight.
So, Jane, how do you feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court?
I thought you were being literal
I feel like you’re not opening up.
I think you should open up more, don't be so guarded
Wouldn't say a lot. More like lance a little.
The dating service was awfully literal.
I can still throw wine in your face.
You don't look like your picture.
Sheila realizes, she needs to be more specific when visualizing a night to remember.
I'll be honest, this wasn't the knight I was expecting...
I’m taking the subway home tonight and I like to be prepared.
Oops, I forgot to ask for a straw..
I thought they’d have straws.
I wouldn't call it "shining armor."  It's more of a "brushed nickel."
Whaddaya mean, "defensive"?
Happy Date Knight.
This is such a treat. It isn’t everyday I get to sit at a round table”
As the years wore on, the princess had long ago resigned herself to the fact that even “happily ever after” is not without it’s embarrassing moments.
How was I supposed to know you meant a NIGHT club, Sharon?
When my friend said this was going to be a ‘nice knight,’ this wasn’t what I expected.”
I've pretty much stopped drinking since the new straw restrictions
This is a knight that you will never forget.
Do you want a straw?
Not a fan of the coat check system?
I told Siri I wanted a night of  dining and amore, not knight in shining armor!
once a knight is too much.
I'm seeing no one else.
So ,what was your first wife like?
So should we ask for a straw?
Can we get the bill? My horse is double parked.
You don’t look like your picture on eHarmony.
I just assumed "'Knight' of the Round Table" was a misprint.
Safe Sex.
'Please Carl, you're being way too defensive about this'
I'm sorry, Roger.  When I wrote I was looking for my knight in shining armor, I was being figurative.
I made it from an old DeLorean.
I'm ready to answer your question now.  Yes, I am a Kavanaugh supporter.
Maybe if we tried a restaurant outside the D.C. area.....
I'm always a little defensive on first dates.
"You are talking through your hat as usual"
I always look forward to date knight.
I know you wanted a booth, but I never get to sit at the Round Table anymore.
Is the suit too much?
Oh, my profile? Sorry. That's an old tapestry of me
I understand being emotionally guarded but really
She said I need to work on being more vulnerable.
I realized I was actually just interested in the shining armor.
At that moment Linda could not decide whether it was auto-correct or Jeff she disliked more. Either way, date night would never be the same.
I'm calling it a knight.
You may want a straw.
Would you be embarrassed if I asked them for a straw?
So you weren't just trying to be cute on your dating profile...
When I was promised a knight of passion,I wasn't expecting this.
Well, this is a knight I'll always remember.
I'm sensing that you're more into verbal jousting.
I've had better knights on the town....
A knight I will purposely forget.
Is something wrong?  You seem to have a hard time opening up to me.
What?
So you think getting well oiled will really help?
I was afraid you wouldn’t look anything like your picture.
I'll be okay as long as they have straws.
And, I was first in my class at Yale.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when you said chivalry's not dead.
What do you mean 'defensive?'
And what are your hobbies?
It's a living!
So what are you going to be for Halloween?
Oh, ok, I thought you just meant you were chivalrous.
We need to talk...
My dad told me never to go out on a date without protection.
Shining? In this light, maybe.
You look different than your profile picture
It's just a blind date, you don't have to be so guarded.
Well, your profile says “Be my Knight in shining armour”
It's WD-40 with a twist. Do you like it?
I was hoping to have a better knight
I know what you mean. I get that chain mail as well.
I wouldn’t say I take advantage of my knights and weekends...
It's just that sometimes it feels like there's something between us preventing us from connecting"
Your profile picture doesn’t do you justice.
Don't look at me like that. I used the metal cleaner you gave me.
No, I'm just surprised that you ordered chicken after rescuing me from that dragon is all.
This is not going to work if you keep your guard up.
Yes, by all means, show me your sword.
Do you want me to ask for a straw?
You looked younger in your photo.
No way, I'm not wearing white satin.
Who doesn’t love a blind date?
The haircut really isn't that bad.
Do you want to ditch this joing and move to White Castle?
I am surprised, you left out that you are wearing glasses in your profile.
You look exactly like your profile photo.
I've always been a sucker for a steely gaze.
Dammit, Nick, this is not what I meant when I said 'chivalry is dead.'
My place to Netflix and joust afterwards?
They serve a nice pig on a spit.
Actually, I meant something different in my ad when I wrote 'willing to go medieval'.
Yes, you certainly appear to be a Renaissance Man.
Will you be emotionally available on Friday?
Could I get a straw?
Is this your idea of a night out?

The difference between "Middle Aged" and "Middle Ages" on an eHarmony profile.
When you said “meet me at the round table” I had no idea.....
This is not what I expected when I used the Camelot dating app
My Old English is a bit rusty.
Did you remember to bring the WD-40?
Well, you're a step up from the toad I was matched with last week.
Well how shiny were you expecting?
I see that my reputation precedes me.
Helen, when I said I need to get oiled, I didn’t mean this.
No first date magnetic attraction, huh?
Join me for a knight cap?
Since chivalry is dead, do you mind going Dutch?
I thought you meant emotional armor
My therapist says I’m having issues being vulnerable.
At least your wife's friends will not be able to recognize you.
You got to be kidding me!  That's not your LANCE?
I know I said you might need protection...
Not quite my knight in shining armor
My heart's desire, my knight in dining armor.
Chivalry is dead .... and uncomfortable.
You really don’t look anything like your Tinder profile.
I amazed at how specialized dating apps have become.
I'll put down my defences when you put down yours
Dorothy, we have really aged since the yellow brick road!
Well of course it has a metalic aftertaste.
The Crusades are NEVER over.
I get the feeling you don’t really like blind dates.
I don't  listen to heavy metal.
Honestly Eddie, a square table, a round table, it doesn't really matter. You're still boring.
Jen regretted asking for a knight in shining armor in her profile.
Can you get me a straw?
A little defensive? well...maybe.
I just have a hard time coming out of my shell, you know?
I hope you don't think I'm the type of girl that will make out on the first knight.
I ‘ve been hurt too many times
Pen mightier than the sword, eh? Surely you joust!
So that makes sense. Its’s “E-Armor-y” not “E-Harmony”
Once a night is enough for me.
I've heard you can be quite defensive.
Well, your profile isn't exactly true either...
Why no, I’ve never considered being a literal person as a relationship handicap. Why do you ask?
Do you happen to have a straw?
Just another knight
I'm  waiting for the wine to breathe, and for a straw.

I thought that ‘Knight in shining armor’ was just a metaphor when I read your ad.
I'm sorry, this isn't going to work. I just can't see myself with a vegan.
I assume this means that mediation is out of the question.
A dry red with medieval undertones..
Not quite as romantic as you expected, is it?
You know John, the wine isn’t the only thing that won’t open up.
But your profile said White Satin.
This is not what I meant by “A night on the town.”

You looked younger in your profile picture
Well, it's not a "raise the visor" kind of an evening, is it?
Just when I was convinced that chivalry was dead.
Are you the victimized American white male?
And they say chivalry is
dead.
What, exactly, did you mean when you said, 'Let's go play Storm the Castle'?
I'm your knight in dining armor. Why don't you think that is funny?

Yes, you did. But I thought you meant you are a “night person”
You need oil more than you need wine!

Met security never noticed I was wearing it out of the building.
I misinterpreted you when you said "a night out."
Brett, you do seem a little defensive.
Believe me, I'm just a teddy bear once you get past the hard exterior.
Well at least you have finally quit smoking.
I’m not disappointed, but I will admit you looked shinier on Tinder.
Yes Bob, I think the waiter got your "fortified wine" joke.
When you said a ‘night out on the town’, this wasn’t really what I had in mind.
Mmmm...My online dating description did say I needed a knight in shining armor.
Sir Drinkalot, I presume?
So Marvin...still a bit edgy since our last argument?
Honestly Fred, how long is this gluten avoidance phase going to last?
This way we are both protected
I really prefer it when the waiter calls me "sir."
I'm just now realizing you meant you wanted a "night out"...

I appreciate safe sex, but don't you think this is a bit much?
Did you pick up the mail?
I thought you said a NIGHT on the town.
The counselor said you should open up with me.
You seem wonderful, but to be honest, I'm kind of a morning person.
You clank, I snore...this could be the break we’re looking for!

It's not chivalry that I wish were dead.
When the dating site said that I'd have a "good knight," I was thinking a "good night".
I wasn't lying on my profile when I said I had "Buns of Steel".
My therapist calls it a defense mechanism.

I appreciate the shining armor, but box wine?
Fruity?  Tasted netallic to me.
Ralph, my fantasy was a night in sublime ardor.
I don't raise the visor until the second date, but I can assure you I am Prince Charming.

I appreciate the effort, but it was more like a metaphor I was using in the "What I'm Looking For" section.
I'm your knight in shining armor. Be careful what you wish for.
My ex said I was overprotective.
Oh so "wild Knight" was a typo huh...
I'm very good at protecting myself from criticism.

I hear the dragon burger is locally sourced.
Now I know when my girlfriend txt'd  me that dinner with you would be a knight to remember it wasn't a spell check glitch.

I’m not a maiden in distress but you’re giving me second thoughts.
Look me in the eye and tell me that you will stop fighting.

I hope they serve the dragon filet medium.

I'm trying to open up.
I never liked history .

I can't see you again. You're dating your self.
Forget I ever mentioned marriage.
It's only our second date and already you're ashamed to be seen with me?
Red? Really?
I suppose you did say you wanted our meeting to be just like old times.
I mistakenly assumed a knight of role play was a typo.
What do you mean it's joust lunch?
I'm really into heavy metal.

My dating profile wasn't supposed to be taken so literally.
Why do they always sit us at the roundtable?
So, you said wanted to talk to me?
Really...how old are you?
I didn't realize that's what my friend meant when she said you had broad shoulders and were into chivalry.
For the record, madam, I think it is you who did not appropriately dress for the occasion.
It's the hairstyle I am struggling with -- so 1950's
I’m being standoff-ish?
I'm a Dame, not a Damsel.
The 'knight is shining armor ' was just a suggestion really . . .
Your dating profile asked for a knight in shining armor.

Okay, so you're from another century.
I'm from another planet.

Hardly a recent photo, was it, Mr.Hot4TrueLove?
I guess that your therapy to open up did not work
Honesty, I'm more into fashion from the 1980's than the 980's.
Your profile said 'shining'....
I didn’t mean to offend you, a butt is a medieval measurement of wine.
You misread my dating profile. All I wanted was a simple date night.
I have a tendency to be fairly guarded on first dates
It's a profile metaphor, Stanley. I don't literally want a 'Knight in Shining Armor'.
You may be a knight in shining armor, but playing footsies with you just broke my toe!
It seems my dating app wish list was taken too literally...
Check, mate, my queen?
I guess you could say I Lance. A. Lot. Ha ha ha hA hA HA HA HA!!! ... where are you going!?
But it was your vulnerability that attracted me to you in the first place!
I love what you've done with your face shield.
Wanna cut our losses? This date has been a Knightmare.
I'm tired of fighting ,let's just have a nice quiet dinner

If you don't mind, I'll just ask for a straw
Cute Keira but hardly subtle. 
They’re going to find out about us eventually.
Admittedly I fall a little short of being a true Renaissance man.
I adore our date nights at the round table.
It's so rare to meet someone who looks exactly like their online dating profile
Harold, I find you difficult to be with because you are so inflexible.
This is not what I meant when I suggested we have a date night.
Honey I don't mind the outfit but must we really take Uber Steed?
When you said you said you’d give me a night to remember, I had no idea ...
My ex really did a number on me, but I thought it was time I put myself out there.
It's just been so hard to get through to men lately.
I hardly recognize you from your online dating profile.
Where’s my damn straw?
You say you're a little wary of involvement after your divorce?
So....you say you don't get many second dates? I can't imagine why.
So, you don’t think I’m hot?
My friend warned me you’d show me one hell of a Knight.
I have this ironclad proposal for you.
See? This is why they shouldn’t outlaw straws.
Sure, the cherry notes are nice.  I wouldn't storm a castle for another bottle, though.
I'm getting a little tired of requesting straws.
Do you always take the wording in personal ads so literally?
For the last time, Sally, I’m not a spit bucket.
I should have taken your description on the dating site literally.
Shall I call you "Sir"?
A "middle-aged shut-in", eh?
No, I meant a night alone.
You look nothing like your online photo!
The lighting is a bit dim in here, isn't it?
When you asked if I wanted to meet some night, this isn’t what I had in mind.
Ok, let me hear your ironclad accuse for forgetting our anniversary.
I told you it was Ladies Night, not Ladies “Knight”.
I suspected my dating app was archaic, - but, really.
I'm not sure that the "knight in shinning armor" comment on the online dating application should be taken quite so literally.
I guess this is what I get asking for a date "night".
I think I would have preferred a quiet night in.
Sorry I'm late. It was hell parking my horse.
Is this your first date? You seem a bit “guarded.”
My ex-wife told me chivalry was dead.
I didn't realize you were speaking metaphorically.
I still care for you too, Lance, but we both know the distress went long ago and, frankly, I've always felt uncomfortable with the term 'damsel'.
So, you said in your tinder bio that you have a pet dragon?
Don't want to hurt your feelings, Sir, but when I posted information, I said I can only date "at night," not I can only date "a knight."
So, who's your plume stylist?
I guess you meant it when your profile said “night in shining armor”
I really thought you'd hold the door open.
Not my knight tonight.
If I’m being honest, this is for emotional wounds as much as the swordplay.
Everyone wants a knight in shining armor, but what about my needs?
I know your dating profile said you were guarded about future relationships, but this is ridiculous.
Really? This is what you think "Wear a suit" means? Just wait until you drag me to another one of your mother's brunches.  I'm gonna put on a dress like you have never seen my love.
I didn't literally mean a Knight in Shining in Armour.
I guess you're technically right.  My profile did say I was a "night" person.
I feel your withdrawing from me.
Your profile requested 'a one knight stan.' And my name really is Stanley, Stan to my friends.
What did you expect on girl's knight out?
The metaphorical is a bit sexier than the literal embodiment.
No, I do not wish to leave with you on your steed.
Well, you said you didn't want a physical involvement.
Strangers in the Knight? How many guys you got in there with you?
I don't own a horse, but I can get you a straw.
Are you looking for another knight out?
Of course rust is always a problem.....
Our kingdom is looking for legal guidance, Cheryl, not life advice.
Another alternative to prevent stains from wine spills would be to use a napkin.
When I asked for a night on the town, this isn’t what I meant.
Can't you just let go for a minute?
So, what kind of night are you looking for?
It's gotta be bittersweet - sacking a city and then finding out they banned straws.
You never mentioned heraldry in your profile.
And besides, I just don’t think you have the mettle I’m looking for.
Well your bio did say you enjoyed the Middle Ages.
I used to be able to identify the vintage, but I have become a bit rusty.
Hey, this isn't my idea of the perfect date either.
You're always so closed off.
I just wanted flowers every now and then.
Your profile said you're looking for a knight in shining armor.
Well...in your profile you did lament the death of chivalry.
Well they let me in, didn't they?

For the millionth time, I did not bring the can opener.  Just go in your suit.
You seem nice.  But when I said I was looking for my knight in shining armor, I actually meant it metaphorically.
The armor, everything, you look exactly like your dating profile. I appreciate that.
To be honest, your armour is just not that shiny.
Shall I have the valet bring my steed around?
Look - I know I'm not exactly "shining" but at least I'm here
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network

I just find in relationships, that my defense mechanisms get in the way..
If you use a plastic straw, I'm going to throw this drink in your face.
So what took you so long?
Thought I mentioned in my profile that I'm not a night person
So, wine isn't the lubricant you were looking for?
My friends heard stories and told me to wear protection.
A "Dark and Stormy"  , yes?
I said go out on a date, not outdated.
I see chivalry is not dead
Somehow, I misunderstood when you asked me out for a nightcap.
Maybe we should joust be friends.
The work is challenging.
Your ad did say that chivalry is not dead.
Just who do you think you are, Don Quixote?
Defense mechanisms? No, I'm more of a people person.
You looked taller at the joust.
The wine is bold and assertive 
But I don’t think it will attack you.
I get that this is the blood of your enemies, but is it a vintage year?
I'm not in distress, but yes, your armor is nice and shiny.
You look different from your profile photos
You sing, “Good knight, Irene” one more time and I’ll have you welded in!
Clearly one of us has too much wine to drink.
I'm sometimes accused of taking things too literally.
I appreciate your chivalry, but I think it’s time to let your armour down, honey.
Just because I said on Tinder I wanted a "knight in shining armor" doesn't mean I want a knight in shining armor.

This'll be a knight to remember.
This isn’t the night I expected.
My dream is to run for the Supreme Court someday
I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences with blind dates.
No, you’re too defensive!
I found it in the MeToo department for Halloween.
One other thing, What happened  to the foil tie the kids made for you?
Your armor was shinier on Tinder.
I said meet me for a NIGHT cap!
'"Well, on Tinder you said you valued chivalry."
Not exactly shining, I know, but I think you'll find that what I lack in shine, I make up for with intellect, my dear."
I meant it literally.

No, the patriarchy is now a bad thing.
This is not what I expected when you said this would be the best night of my life...
Amore ---- it's amore!!!
Whence shall I start?
I assume you're using the term "joust" metaphorically.
When I said on my profile “knight in shining armour”, This is not what I expected.
I have to say, you do clean up good, with a little steel wool.
They told me it was a night on the town.
It's a shame they don't have straws anymore.
Yes, it’s permanent. Why do you ask?
I meant a 'night out' not a 'knight out', darn that spellcheck
You look a little different on your profile.

When I said it I meant, treat me like a real lady: take me places I’d like to go, open the door every once in a while, sweep me off my feet. But this is fine… I guess.
Well you aren't all that shining, and I think you're being defensive!
You literally have to ask for a straw, these days.
Are you saying your turn-ons were “nights” and “shiny armoires” this whole time?
I don’t care that it came with the suit.  I am not wearing any chastity belt!”
It’s just that you looked taller on Tinder.
and that’s shining armor, right?
I'm just saying, it looked a lot more 'shining' on your profile pic.
I didn't say I needed rescuing. I said I needed to get laid.
Yes, I did hear they were predicting hail.
Not to be too personal, but you seem a little tarnished around the edges.
The night is still young.
As I said on my online dating profile, I take chivalry very seriously.
What? Is there something on my face?
Just a quick knight cap!
You've been defensive and on guard all evening.  Please tell me what's on your mind.

It was a speed-dating metaphor.
Well, I dont know why you thought I speaking figuratively.
And as the conversation lagged: "Been a while since I last dated. Feelin' a little rusty, I must admit."
Oh..... , It's going to be one of those nights, is it?
I guess the dating site did say something about you wanting to come out of your shell...
I don't understand, my Tinder profile says "White Knight Type" right at the top.
When I said I'd like a night out for a change, this isn't what I meant.
You are not the Knight in Shining Armor I expected.
Yes, but I identify as a Day...

Trust me, I look just like my profile picture, only more... chivalrous.
You look just like your pictures on Tinder.
So I checked the box on the profile that said, 'Champion seeking damsel.' Does that distress you?

I don't know Lance, I just don't see myself in three years moving out of the city to a castle surrounded by a moat, waiting all day for you to come home from slaying dragons.

Well, at least I don’t need to use fabric softener
Oh, yes, it's a movement #NotMeAgain
Sorry I’m late, ma’am. I lost track of time.
Tonight, I’m the knight who says oui.”
Men are under attack. I just wanted to play it safe.
My friends call me Lance, more frequently that I like.
You can just wipe away that sad face, this night is young.
So that's how a sixteen-year-old avoids getting carded in a bar!
You know, there are lots of dating sites for people without herpes.
Ever since that rainy weekend, I'm not sure I can't rust you again.
This isn't defense it's offense, girlfriend.
When you told me you had a big night planned, I wasn’t thinking of this.
Shall we make it an early knight?
Guinevere_razzle_dazzle_69?
Crisp, full-bodied, nice finish, the tannens are a wee bit aggressive, but with time it has the potential to go medieval on your ass.
I thought I’d ordered an armored car.
This is not what I expected, when I signed up for a night out.
Dan was a little disappointed when she said he could just call her 'Gwen'.
I get it  but this is not what I had in mind for a blind date
It's a first date. I don't want you to judge me on my looks.
My ex always acted like such a helpless princess.
After the knighting, I lost interest in people.
Lancelot never asked for a straw.
Joan was fed up with niche dating websites.
You don't look like your photo on Tindr
A knight out with his date.
But your eHarmony request was for a knight in shining armor!
When you suggested a night out, this isn’t what I was expecting
You’ve got an impenetrable personality. May we just say “good night?”
Did I take it to literally?
Not exactly the nightcap I had in mind, but I can dig it.
As a Yale grad, I have to tell you I might go all medieval on you.
You're a tight-lipped one.
OK, yes, I did say that I wanted to have a good night...
When I asked you to be my knight in shining armor, I didn't mean for you to take it literally.
I am suspicious that you think that taking me to dinner is going to lead to a one knight stand.
This isn't what I was thinking when I said I needed a date night...
Your profile said you had a sharp tongue . . .
Don't even think about asking for a plastic straw.
Your Murphy Brown costume sucks.
Could we please pick the next restraunt for the food instead of the table shape?
No, it's not rust. I used superglue.
You want a child.  I want to dress up like a child.  I still don't see why that's not enough.
This isn't working. I say day, you say knight.
After the recent confirmation hearings I felt this was the safest way to go"
Thanks for the night out.
I have a very vulnerable ego and easily get hurt.
This is not what I meant when I said date night.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned "knight in shining amor" in my profile.
I remember the days when you could take barbs.
Darn app! I wanted to go out at night! Not with a knight!
Well... Your Ad said you were looking for a Knight in Shining Armor.
Your profile said "shining armor."
I know we belong to different political parties, but this is a bit extreme.
...and then he forgot to pick up my dry cleaning today. These millennial squires are driving me to distraction.
Well , at least I can see that I'm making a good reflection on you.
You really want your reds to be served at dungeon temperature.
I’m working on body positivity but I’m not there yet.
Your ponytail is so in fashion these days.
I thought you said you were," a mid level knight".
Well, get it out of your system.
"A fruity wine, yes, with a soft mouthfeel, but also inexplicatly metallic."
Tonight to knight I need your love tonight
In your online profile, your armor looked shinier.
Spencer was getting defensive again.
Guess I don't want any knight in shining armor after all.
What's the catch.
I thought you wanted a date knight?
Gosh, it feels like ages since I've been here.
Would you like a straw, Sir Lunchalot?
Why can't you ever remember to bring a change of clothes for when we go to dinner after work?
a knight to remember
It was drip-dry. I’ll buy an oil can.
I’m having a bad (k)night...
I understand you’re going for chivalrous, but you’re taking things too far.
Well...they said I'd meet a night in shining armor one day but I was expecting a white horse.
No jousting on the first date?
You know, when I said I wanted a knight in shining armor, this isn't quite what I had in mind...
It's like the valet had never seen a horse before. Anyhow, do you go on a lot of Tinder dates?
I am afraid of things like tomatoes and asparagus.
I hope, Sir Knight, there's a chastity belt under that armor.
It’s nice to see your dedication to being chivalrous.
My former girlfriend broke up with me.  She said that I was emotionally unavailable.
Don't be surprised if the Merlot tastes a little tinny.
When I said I wanted something “full bodied” I meant the wine.
Yes, Arthur . . . the table is round and the grail appears to be holy.
And you think I am being defensive?
I don’t trust these guys. They fed me my horse.
This is going to be a long night.
Tinder didn't prepare me for this.
I need to stop going on blind dates.
IS THIS ROUND TABLE LARGE ENOUGH?
It has more bling than a pussy hat
Next time, I'd rather you suggest dinner on an evening that you don't have a jousting match afterward.
I thought you said a night with amore.
Call me 'my liege', like they did at Holton-Arms School.
I wouldn't have guessed you're the old-fashioned, shy type.
My memorable first dates?  This certainly is not a knight to remember.
Have straws been discontinued yet?
What did you mean when you said this place was fit for a king?
Silverware......?!!!
You're no Princess- but I would like to see you again.
They told me I'd be a date for the night!
So what made you swipe knight?
so what then, i'm the damsel in distress?
This isnt the night on the town I had in mind...
So the concept is Renaissance fare
I should have specified that I'm more of a morning person on my Tinder profile...
Eloise sat back, glum and uncertain. She was committed to dismantling the patriarchy and despised the limp progressives who posted their values but didn't live them. But Rodrick was a massive alpha and it'd been forever since she'd had the good dick.
Well to be perfectly honest your armor is a little dull.
I'm meeting with Kavanaugh and this is my protective gear.
When I said a night on the town might help our relationship, this is not what I had in mind....
Nice hat Sir Drinksalot.
Frankly,I'm tired of your knight in shining armor routine.
Lately our jousting has become a bit listless.
I don't have much time I left my horse in a no parking zone.
Are you sure we haven't met before?
Come to my place? I'd like to show you my can-openers collection.
On the bright side, our case will be heard by the Supreme Court.
I'm 42, so yeah, I'm totally into full grown men who play video games.
I try to limit myself to one of these a knight.
What color are your eyes?
I think I misunderstood the dating service when they said they wanted me to have a "good knight."
‘Our first date in months, and you couldn’t pick a place that didn’t remind me of work?”
When I said I wanted a date night...
A few drinks help loosen me up.
I can understand having your guard up on a first date but did you really need to slaughter the valet?
When your dating profile said Knight in shining armour I thought you meant metaphorically.
Lower your guard, Sid---I'm not that tough a feminist.
I think you over-prepared for pick-your-own-lobster.
Another one with shining armor eh
...little different than the profile pic
I'm more of a late afternoon in dull armor kind of guy.
With STD these days, you can't be too careful...
Didn't you tell me to iron my suit?
Join me. We’ll be the knights of the round table.
I like defensive.
I couldn’t order wine in my burqa.
A night at a round table? I thought you said a Knight of the Round Table.
You’ve grown on me, Gerald. You’re not as guarded as my other lovers.
Your Match.com profile said you were"chivalrous" but this is ridiculous...
She’d hoped for more excitement having a knight out.
You couldn't think of a more subtle way to show that chivalry isn't dead?
I never imagined my knight in shining armor would drink merlot.
If you think this is something, wait until you see me try to eat.
Sorry...it's just not shiny enough.
I've got 3 kinds of lubes and 21 different oils, will any of them help loosen you up?
It matches my politics.
I'm sorry, I didn't know this was a straw-free establishment.
Alas, the shining armor/'damsel thing isn't working either.
I'm feeling I'll suited for this relationship.
Does the shining armor ever come off?
It wasn’t such a nuisance before straws became so un-PC.
Dinner date? I guess chivalry's not dead after all.
Listen, your mother misunderstood when I said, "I wanted a good night out."
Can you believe this is the only restaurant that serves roasted pheasant?
It's Military Surplus. It's sure to be back in style soon.
She did say she’d set me up with a night in shining armor
That suit of the month club for the middle aged has gotten a bit literal dont you think?
Aren't you taking this diet thing a little too far?
Nice night, huh?
Forget I said it.
Sorry, Duane. I guess I didn't really consider the full implications of the shining armor.
Is this your idea of a night out?"

Deborah Blum, Beverly Hills, Ca
Is it just me or does this wine taste like metal?
With all the cuts to the FDA, you can’t be too careful.
Not feeling it...could I see you joust a little bit?
Yes Arthur..your profile did state that you were a Knight in shining armour.
Your armour isn't shining.
From the 1990s Archives:
"Of course, I always wear protection."
How could you forget the sword?
A nice unassuming wine, with just a hint of rust.
So...you come 'round this table often?
Mmmmm....well...it’s just that I was expecting a little shinier, lighter, and frankly a little less vintage.
I understand  your #MeToo pushback, but the horse ride home is just not happening.”
This is our first date. Aren’t you being a little too cautious?
My attorney said, 'Think of it as a chastity belt for a man's reputation.
I think they have paper straws.
Sorry, I don’t date literalists.
You look better in person than your Tinder pic.
I know this is called a "blind date," but isn't this taking it a little too far?
Hold on. I'll ask the waiter to get you a straw.
When I said I was looking for a knight in shining armor, this isn't exactly what I meant.
Does this protect you from me, too?
Ah, not a night date a knight date!
Sooo, you told the kids that I was abusive?
This is a 1894 imperial burgundy from central France.
You looked very different from your profile picture
I do not consent to a good knight kiss.
Gwen, you can call me Arthur, King Arthur.
‘“Maybe ‘the night is still young,’ but how can I know for sure unless you lift that visor?”
.. and the armour is not as shining as I'd hoped
How long?
This wasn’t what Barbara meant when she said she wanted to be courted.
Of course I suspected. You're the first "Lancelot" I've met on JDate.
WHAT PART OF A NIGHT OUT  DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?
TFW 23 and Me says you're 19% Saxo-Norman
When you told me to get ready for a wild and crazy night, I was not expecting this.
I'd say its either "steely" or "flinty"  -- as usual.
Don’t you dare play footsie with me!
This Me Too movement has me on edge.
Vintage or new?
Do you want me to ask the waiter for a straw?
I'm so sorry, but I just got a text that I'm needed at an emergency jousting.  We should do this again sometime.
I think I can make a case for 
a straw."
Armored Anonymous, eh? Not cute.
I do this every knight.
A typical modern scene is disrupted by a single incongruous detail, to humorous effect!
Hold on, I forgot to ask the waiter for a straw
Dis your ex keep your coat of arms?
Your profile said you are looking for your knight in shining armor, I thought you’d like this.
You’re clearly upset. What did you think I meant by ‘The Man of Steel?’
I wat a more open relationship.
Clever pun, Howard.
I'm surprised they don't have flagons here, and no, I didn't wear this on my Match.com listing. But it's who I am.
Frankly, your germaphobea is getting a little tiresome..
You don't look a thing like your Facebook photo.
It’s definitely better in virtual reality.
Now that you finally showed up, I think that I'd rather have you in shining spandex.
Is it just me, or do you detect a hint of metal on the nose?
You said that you wanted a night out.
No, I am not looking for a knight in shining armor.
Why don’t you try AA?
Well, my profile did say that I will be your knight in shining armor."
Even wine doesn't make the knights exciting around here....
My friends say that once you break down my armor I am a nice guy.
I'm being iron-ic.
Peek a boo I see you!
A true knight would allow me an entree.
Well, I'M on a crusade to shame moms on the internet.
Like President Trump says: We young white men are the victims of the #MeToo Movement and have to protect ourselves when on dates.
I see you have’nt updated your online profile.
I can't really hear you in that thing.  Please tell me you didn't just say that I put the "Damn" in "Damsel in Distress"?
I think you have a drinking problem.
That isn't what I meant by well-dressed 'male'.
Really, honey. The square table is fine for tonight.
Nobody'll ever pin anything on me!
Protection from rich frats who like beer?
My mother always told me to be careful and take protection on a blind date.
I'm beginning to believe you're shunning my shining.
Steel yourself; I’ve got some bad news.
You took date night literally.
I thought I  told the dating service i want amore
So what if you're the white knight, you can still drink red wine.
I don't think your company, Outer Armour, has a chance.
Glad you were able to fit me in before Comic Con.
Is your family very Orthodox?
But your bio said you were looking for a knight in shining armor?
Not every Knight has shiny armor you know!
I know you can talk.  Now say something worthy of a New Yorker cartoon contest.
Now that I know why you said you like one-knight stands on your page, is Lancelot your real name?"
When you billed yourself as a knight in shining armour, I didn't take you literally.
This must be your knight out.
"Should we get the check, mate?"
He only makes me wear a chastity belt.
What the fuck kind of shit is this? Seriously. Fuck.
I should have been more specific when I said I prefer night dates.
Wow, Guinevere!  I wouldn’t have recognized you!
LADY, I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE 400 YEARS FOR THE WAITER TO BRING THE MENU.
Whether or not the damsels were distressed, it sounds like you're not ready to commit."
I guess you’re serious about no means No.
You can call it your Halloween Practice Run all you want but you’re on your own when I finish this drink.
We met at the Saratoga Renaissance Fair, what did you expect?
I know your Personals ad said 'I'm a real knight person,' but I thought you were just being ironic.
A great knight for wine.
I've just been feeling so 'closed-in' lately.
OK, so you still have the armor, but after 30 years it sure isn't shining anymore.
Are you up for some verbal jousting? Or, maybe just a 'knight' out-on-the-town?
I hear the breastplate's awfully good.
I hate Tinder dates.
Tinder didn't do you justice. Shall I request a straw?
No!  I told you I wasn't going to carry your straws any more!
What do you mean, "I was speaking metaphorically"? Alice, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't even know what a metaphor is.
You can't fool me, I see you checking out the waitress and wishing you could pinch her bottom.
This is going to be quite a (k)night
No, it’s not just a game- it’s a way of life.
Armorsonly.com
I still get notes of metal mostly.
Oh, so YOU'RE  afraid  now?
I should've known better than to swipe knight...
You wouldn't happen to be a damsel in distress?
and another thing about superior western values
I''m  sorry.  I can't give you a straw.
What a waste of my time you are!  All you do is clank!
He was just too shiny.
I understand you have to be a bit wary on a first date.
I know when you're just coming out of  a prior relationship you tend to be very protective of yourself.
What were the chances that my name is Gawain, I'm dressed like this, and we were seated at a round table?
You said 'date night', didn't you?
Trust me, it has a delightful nose.
I know my Match.com profile said I wanted a "knight in shining armor" but didn't mean it literally.
I told you, this place banned straws to save the environment.
I never wanted to hurt you, but it's been hard not to see it as a challenge.
Clearly your expectation of "we need to talk" is different than mine
I thought the invitation said drinks "at night" not "with knight"
I'd like to see that waiter treat us that way tonight.
Sorry, I’m joust not that into you.
Sorry, we turned all the straws into plowshares.
This restaurant has an unusual dress code.
Sorry, I'm used to a different kind of roundtable.
When a renaissance man asked me out on a date,I never imagined it would end up like this!
Actually, I was hoping you’d bring a little more "amour" tonight.
Now I feel safe enough to drink with you again!
My ad said “shining” armor.
So you think that #MeToo isn't enough?
I gave up the "shining" part a long time ago, so you're good.
The dating site said that you were into "heavy metal"!

Jeff Manly
Toronto,On
My profile DID say Knight in Shining Armor, after all.
You know, it's so hard to get through to you ~ I never know what you're thinking or feeling,  and sometimes I feel that's the way you want to keep it.
Not the knight in shining armor Susan imagined.
My humblest apologies, milady. Based on your Tinder profile, I reckoned you would rather fancy the Shiraz.
To Sue’s dismay, he looked exactly like he did in his Tinder pictures
Liberal or conservative?
This night ... of all nights
I'm just not feeling truly seen.
I’ll be honest. This “knight in shining armour schtick”  isn’t easy to pull off while sipping Chardonnay.
You took me quite seriously when I told you I was looking for "a knight in shining armor."
So...you gonna take me home to knight?
I feel like you still keep your armor up with me.
It's OK.  Here all the waiters are unarmed.
It's been a problem without straws.
Yeah, well, you may still be my knight but the shine wore off long  ago.
Despite the wishful thinking, Ye Olde Dating App was exactly like what it seemed.
A knight's night out.
My knight in shining armor was a figure of speech....
This is all I am having; can you ask for a straw?
Nope. I’m a Hazel in a red dress. Thanks, though.
Margaret finally got her knight out!
Mother, I became too exasperated by your wardrobe criticisms.
How about this for a knight out?
When the ad said  “knight in shining armor” I had no idea................................
When I said that I wanted one night alone, this is not what I meant, Steve.
Less aged chivalry and more aged Chianti, please.
Um...this is awkward...but what it says I’m ‘looking for’ on my Tinder profile is meant figuratively not literally...
Why should I be surprised? The dating service promised me that I would meet my knight in shining armor.
You idiot, what I said was "don't forget to wear protection for desert at my place."
I sure miss straws.
I know, but when you put that thing on, you knew that straws were no longer allowed.
The bottles are half off on ‘Knight’s Night.’
Look, give it a chance. My Match.com posting explicitly said, Knight in Shining Armor!
I'm afraid your shine is already wearing thin.
Sorry, it's the helmet. I thought you said 'mead, too'.
Off with the costume already!
My red isn't pairing well with your white knight syndrome.
So this is what you meant when you said you were a knight in shining armor ...
So uh, you looked younger online..maybe it's the glasses
Im a once a knight kinda guy
Honestly, I was expecting more dragon.
I thought we could spend the knight together.
And to think a fancy place like this doesn't even have straws
To be honest with you Ralph, this is not my idea of a night out on the town.
They don't have a round table and they're out of straws; it's just not your day.
I forgot to bring the straws.
My ex used to say I was too vulnerable.
Luckily, I just got the most beautiful stainless steel FDA-approved ultra long drinking straw on Amazon!
She: You lied to me.  You told me you were warm, loyal and brave.
He: No, I told you I was a knight in shining armor.
I can't believe you quit your Day job!”
Maybe a length of surgical tubing might work.
Do you have a spare straw?
Your online posting noted that you wanted someone with old-fashioned values and was be a good protector.
So, do you enjoy frequent nights out?
The moment she realized that "Plenty of Knights" was no better than "Plenty of Fish"
You know, this taste more 14th century to me.
Dating in Trump's America
I notice a hint of iron on the front end.
Literal much?
I will try the wine as soon as they bring me my straw.
It's so important to have friends like you to talk to, without the need to have my guard up.
I'm sorry, Gerald, but your armor has lost its shine.
The shield in your avatar had more karats
Nine and a half years of sobriety! What’s your secret, Sir Robert?
I too, sense a metal taste in the mouth!
Sigh...this wasn't really what I meant by a night date.
I wouldn't call it distress...angst, maybe?
So - how was your day today?
So, now my dating site does time travel as well?
When filling out his dating profile, Arthur typed ‘night person.’
You’ll have to open up to drink the wine.
Fortnight is a video game, not a cosplay.
A guilty conscience needs an armor.
I also said I was looking for a 'partner in crime.'
So sorry, they do not issue straws here."

This isn't what I meant when I said one-night stand.."
Cathy C, San Dieg
Do I call  you "sir"?
Dear God, Gladys, I said RHETT Kavanaugh is joining is for a drink.
I know you said you were a bit defensive but perhaps you might have understated things
Mid millennium modern clothing is in right now.
In better light, this suit really shines.
I'm not really liking this. It's a little too much of a metallic taste for me.
I hope you brought a metal straw, too.
You asked for a Sir Galahad
Straws are what, you say?
I only hope there is a male within the mail.
When I said girl's night out I didn't mean this..
I wasn't lying when I said shyness is the chink in my armor.
Thanks,but what makes you say 'good knight?'
You're not shining. I'll get the silver polish.
Arthur, it's grate to see you.
My dinner choice is usually pasta.
Your sabatons are crushin' my mules.
You misunderstood my profile. I wanted a night out not a knight who is out of it.
Yes, I suppose my Tinder photo was more from the Middle Ages.
I'm sorry, you're a bit short.  I'm used to long knights.
When I requested a lady of the night, I had something very different in mind.
That's a lot of protection you've got on there. Is there anything you want to tell me?
I said in the profile I"m a history buff.
I think it's time for me to say, 'Thank you and good night.'
Well, I certainly don't think knights in shining armor are supposed to suggest Dutch treat!
It's too bad plastic straws have been outlawed
Sorry, but I think we have different ideas about knights in shining armor.
Do you joust here often?
It's an organic blend,with a hint of Rustoleum,with a slightly impertinent corrugated iron finish.
I've finally met my knight in shining armor!
How did the hearing go today, honey?
I don't htink that you should take rust so personally.
Well, yes, I may have my defense mechanisms, but on the other hand I save a bundle on plastc surgery and dry cleaning
Nope, I don't shine armor.
What is the world does “dilly dilly” mean?
I understand you need to request a straw now.
Aren't you carrying travelling in cognito a bit too far?
I can't wait until this night is over.
Without my armor, I'm more the weak noisy type.
This NOT what I meant when i suggested we have date night.
When I asked you to be my knight in shinning armor I did not mean I wanted Prince Albert in a can!
The chivalry is nice, but straws, really?
You know Gerald, It seems as if your DNA research has gone a little too far.
It’s kind of dark in here. Hard to tell if you’re really my Knight in Shining Armor.
When I saw your profile picture, I was immediately drawn to your polished and gallent looks.
I can tell from the bouquet that I would like this wine.
It's like Skype with the video off.
So you heard' about 'A Knight on the Town' on what radio station?
I'm really not looking for a knight in shining armor type right now.
With my ex is was really all about, "who ARE you, anyway?"
I know someone put water in the wine because my helmet is rusted shut.
So, will the sommelier be back to help with the visor?
This was certainly not what I expected when we discussed a 'night on the town'"
So, are you into retro now or is that just plain antique?
What really happened.
Hold it. You're looking for an affair de what?
So your profile said medium build...
I have to say,  you don’t look anything like your jdate picture.
Darn. I forgot my straw at the castle.
This is not what I expected when you invited me for a night out.
I should have known better than to go to a speed dating event that uses round tables.
So if  I ask for a straw it's because I hate turtles? I relate more to turtles than you'll ever know, Shannon.
So, you think my safest sex outfit will damage your Kia?
I think you are worrying too much about spills.
It has a “metallic flavor” you say? Gee, Arnie, I can’t imagine why.
My place or yours?.  My place has a can-opener and WD40.  What do you have aside from a dungeon and lots of chains & whips?
Would you rather have a Rob Roy?
Well, this will be a night to remember.
Chateau Lubricant"
I suppose part of this is my fault, but I assumed you would know knight in shining armor is a euphemism, how are you going to eat?
You've heard the rumors then?
Small plates indeed.
When I said I wanted to go on a date with a chivalrous man, this is not what I meant
I doubt this will fix your iron deficiency.
I know you said you were a knight in shining armor, but really?
Ought not Lancelot
Mary, You said you wanted a knight in shining armor...
And it shouldn't matter that my name is Becky...
It's full-bodied with metallic notes, and pairs best with aged Gruyère.
You've said some hurtful things, and I just felt self-protective.
Because they say it's going to be an unusually bad Flu season.
It’s too bad you don’t like this table.  It’s the only kind I can sit at.
I'll just be straightforward about this. I use my lance a lot.
Come on!  I didn't want my knight in shining armor to really be a knight in armor.
Tricky Tinder
It's corked, but I need you to tell them.
Do you really need to be this defensive when I am mansplaining?
Dracophobia is not a STD, in case you are wondering.
I'd like to defend your honor.
Clearly you are not my knight in shining armor. You can't drink.
My helmet is an alternative to a wine aerator
Your first time on WhiteKnightsOnly.com?
Yes, your plume is fluffy, but you may have taken your virginity oath a little too far.
Can't say that I know Sir Loin of Beef Wellington, why do you ask?
That's a nice suit of armor. But I can still see your ankle bracelet, Sir Naughty.
You take your night caps seriously.
You really took your emotional armor to a new level this time... didn't you Albert?
I don't want to embarrass you but do you mind if I ask for a straw?
I know I said I was looking for a knight in shining armour but...
If tonight goes well, tomorrow, I’ll introduce you to my dragon.
It's nice, but it's not shiny enough.
How do you feel about beer?
Tinder said you'd be my knight in shinning armor, not a loser in tin foil.
Well, what a knight this turned out to be. {Sigh}
I’m sorry, but you’ve lost your shine.
I think it is too soon after your break up to start dating again.
My profile did say I enjoyed going out as a knight, not at night.
This is an open and shut case.
Sorry! Straws are no longer an option.
If you're not going to drink your wine, will you pass it over?
But enough about how perfect this table is. How do you feel about heraldry?
I thought there was something odd about "Wine Knight"  at this place.
I feel like we're going two steps forward and then one step to the side.
You must be the knight in shining armor I always dreamed for!
Moira thought she was clear when suggesting they celebrate with a wine night out.
Strictly speaking, women aren't allowed at the round table.
When your profile said "time traveler" I thought it was a metaphor...
Adventurous and shy do fit your online profile.
So.. how's the knight going?

I’ve always wondered how a knight drinks wine

Always nice to meet another esquire

I know your profile said you still believed in chivalry but I just want to make sure it's you.
You'll have to excuse me, I haven't been on an obscured vision date in a long time.
I thought I was being invited out for a night at Round Table, not an evening at Pizza Hut.
I'm glad our relationship doesn't make you feel vulnerable anymore.
WHY DO I ALWAYS GET THE DULL ONES?
I've found it very helpful in determining long-term compatibility.

Thanks for meeting me during my break here at the castle...  and the outfit means my wife's friends will never know it's me!

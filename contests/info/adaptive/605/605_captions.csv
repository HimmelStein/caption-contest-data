Window to the soul, my ass!
Me watching you watching me watching you...
Are you "a tortured portrait of people lost in the burgeoning light of The New Communism" or are we?
Quit messing with the audio tour, and get back on our side

His eyes seem to follow me across the room. They also seem to blink.
Well, I find you derivative, too!

We’re a portrait of how come you don’t call your mother?
We'd like three Bruegels and a French frieze.

Finally, Helen, a piece of art that really speaks to me.
You want YOUR money back? We want OUR money back!
Art thou the beholder?
I liked this museum better before Bill Gates bought it.
Still life - Loudmouth in his natural habitat.
It's as if the artist wasn't even trying.
Lacks realism.
This must have been during the artists boring period.
That ain't art, that's our podiatrist!
You're no Rembrandt, yourself, mister!

I feel like he's looking right at me!

We are looking for the gift shop too.

Honey, this one looks so lifelike
Fake art?
Well, he don't look real to me!
You're right, it does look like him.
Two galleries for the price of one. I told you there had to be a catch.
It’s actually just a hole in the wall. This is the gallery next-door.
I tell you, we've been framed!
It's early Munch. "The Blank Stare."
I saw this one yesterday at Home Depot.
And I say that a hole in the wall with a frame around it ain't art! This is why Trump won!
It says here that the artist "escapes the tyranny of the frame"
Why don’t you paint a picture? It’ll last longer!
Selfie with Mona and Lisa
You're the beholder and we are the beauty in your eye.
It is not a good likeness.
You call that "Realism"? Nobody's skin is that blotchy.
This one looks very derivative.
Don't mind us. We've always wanted to be in pictures.
Excuse me, sir. Will the E train take us to Times Square?
Seems a little one dimensional...
The colors are bland. The proportions are clownish. There’s no depth of expression. It’s just saying nothing to me.

Big whoop- my kid could do that.
This is just some hole in the wall.
We're Whistler's in-laws
Now this one shows talent, just like he's standing the other side of the frame.
This one is titled "Verisimilitude".

It’s called “being on the inside looking out”
What, you think we're a mirror into your soul? No! I tell you it's all a lie, we've been framed. We're only a reflection of the way life used to be.
That's a fancy frame around a window. Fake art.
Well this one is called fat-headed tourists lost at the museum. I don't get it?
And, in some of our finest pieces, we see ourselves.
No, Mr. Gates, I guess we didn't read the Terms of Service, let alone the "human specimens" clause.
Hey Art!
I guess what it comes down to is, are you imitating art or are we?
My card says you are abstract
Tom's mid-career period, when reality and the surreal were yoked in maddening fashion.
I don't get this one....so please don't act like you do either.
You're lucky, our family does't reflect badly on you.
We're entitled "Art Imitates Life". You got a problem?
Yeah well your Grindr profile isn't completely honest, either.
For Gods sake Harold - leave us alone already.
Don’t worry, he’s more confused by us than we are by him.

Alright, fine! You caught me. I'm into art.
We only paid for the two dimensional tour.

Guess we're at the temporary exhibits.
On second thought, let’s skip the men’s room exhibit.
What an unique painting, MAN IN THE MIRROR, It looks so real.
I liked last month's 'Lone Museum Patron' better
No one captures the sense of complete disappointment better than Rembrandt.
We don’t mean to reflect badly upon you.

As you can see this is an open concept.
Two Superburgers, a Fish-o-Rama, a Degas, and an order of fries. To go.

I know people say a picture is worth a thousand words, but do I have to stand here & listen to all of them?

Seems like I have seen this picture before!
This one's called 'Mirror, Interrogation Room No. 4.' I don't get it.
. . . and lastly, do you really think we enjoy looking at the inside of a museum?
Hey mister, have you seen Alice?
It's a bit too abstract for my tastes.
They told us to get our parking ticket validated at the Italian Renaissance. Can you point us to the nearest Raphael?
You aren't the only one with an agenda.
What I resent is being called a medium.
I don't care what the catalogue says, it is a two way mirror in a fancy frame!
Through the Looking Glass
This one is titled Appreciating Great - wait, isn't that your cousin Fred?!!
I dunno…all the pamphlet thingy says is ‘Modern man. Confused. One of an ongoing series.’
We're the Bjornstadts from Trondheim-- and apparently every time that crazy Edvard Munch sees us, he starts running though the streets screaming. We just want him to come to our choir practices at St, Olaf's on Thursday nights.

We didn't do it - we're being framed!
Is this exhibit surreal or what?
This piece really speaks to me.
Read your catalogue, you idiot, it says right here, This is a mirror, and we're art ghosts. It's called conceptual reflective surrealism.
The eye of the beholder is in the eye of the beholder.
Oh for cryin' out loud! Even I could paint that.
Yeah the eyes follow you... but it's the artist's realism that gives ME the creeps.

It's art about a guy looking at art, and we're the art, and so is he!
You got framed? We thought you were stolen, Art.
I’m pretty sure the artist is still alive.
I hear you.
Hmm, the subject of this piece seems lonely, confused, and ugly.
The painting of a guy standing with a piece of paper in his hand is not art in my opinion.
It's called realism, buddy!
Fake art?

Wow, artists these days will paint any ugly face and call it art. What do you ladies think?
Stop whistling at my mother!
This might be a little too minimalist for us too.
Wow! Look how the artist captures the mediocrity of his subject. He really shows you what a man who has accomplished absolutely nothing in life would look like!
He is a loathsome, offensive brute. Yet I can’t look away.
No, I'm not "Woman Descending the Stairs".
It's not polite to stare!
This ones an old classic.
you call that Art!? I say it's Bill Tornton!

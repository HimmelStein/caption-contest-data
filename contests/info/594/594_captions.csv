I remember them from last year. They must be perennials.
Relax, they're just DRESSED like lumberjacks.
I love the fall when all their shirts turn plaid.
Honestly? He's like, ten rings too old for her.
They've been in love since 1992. I know. Their initials are carved in my ass.
I just love watching them turn plaid in the fall.
Could I interest you in a treesome?
You think that's weird, you should watch them pollinate.
Look, Kevin, we're in a Cialis commercial!
... And then their hair begins to lose its color, eventually falling off ...
There was a time when a beard and a checkered shirt would have made me nervous
Hey look, you can see her roots.
It's still my favorite time of the year, when the weather gets cold and they all turn plaid.
They met on Timber.
Ah, to be young and rootless.
I'm with you, if they trip and fall down, I think they would make a sound.
This is the sixth pharmaceutical commercial we've been in this year!
I love autumn when their colors turn to plaid.
Must be love. Neither's got a smartphone out.
I love how they turn plaid in Autumn.
Don't you just want to carve your initials in them?
That's how people make acorns.
You can relax now; they just looked like lumberjacks.
I love it when the shirts turn plaid.
I bet they don't know his wife jogs up this path every morning.
You used to look at me like that 20 rings ago!
That was us before we grew apart.
He likes her bush.
Their cell phones must be broken.
Sure makes you feel sappy, doesn't it?
They’re adorable until they carve their initials into you.
It looks consensual now, but give it forty years.
Don't you love how they change colors in the fall?
The autumn flannels are spectacular this year!
They're so cute, with their short little lives.
Ah--flannel--the first sign of autumn.
I hear this week is peak flannel.
I'll give it six months.
Checks and plaid? I give it six weeks.
Reminds me of us. Before we grew apart.
It's better now that they tattoo their names on each other instead of on us.
I'm happy for him, but I miss his hugs.
"Lumberjacks in love. Maybe now the killing will stop.'
Have you seen the size of his wood-pecker?
If we weren't here and one of those people fell over do you think they would make a sound?
It's so nice to see someone without a dog.
For the record, he's not touching her butt.
Sure, they may look happy, but they are still not quite out of the woods.
Their flannels are so beautiful this time of year!
I love when the plaids come out. The reds and greens are just gorgeous.
I wish I could carve our initials in one of them.
I understand that they engrave words into their own trunks these days.
Thank God they are not walking their dogs today.
It almost makes you forget they're destroying us.
Phew, I thought they were lumberjacks.
Is it me, or does everything seem nicer since Seattle legalized pot?
It's fun to see him with someone different each week.
It’s de-leavely.
They seem nice--for rootless, self-absorbed creatures.
Lucky day !! No dogs so far.
I love when the fall plaids come out.
Enjoy your walk, future mulch.
Look at those two lovebirds. I'm getting all sappy.
I love this time of year when all the plaid flannel colors come out.
They're okay, but their four legged children are disrespectful.
I imagine he wood kiss her if he had the balsa
I'm so glad that 'lumberjack' is more a look than an occupation these days.
Third girl this week. And they say we’re shady.
I wonder where he'll bury this one.
I'm no expert on humans, but I think they're about to exchange pollen.
Is this your first pharmaceutical advertisement, too?
I'm no human expert, but I think they're about to exchange pollen.
It's funny to see them without their phones.
If she's looking for majestic wood, she won't find it with him.
Lucky them. They get to pollinate year-around.
Please give generously to the Association of Cartoonists Who Can't Draw Hands.
Phew.. not lumberjacks, just hipsters.
They're so colorful this time of year.
I always love being in the city for the changing of the wardrobes.
I love the smell of L.L. Bean in the fall.
Sure, they're a cute couple but lumberjack shirts scare the xylem out of me!
What do you think, Cialis or Viagra?
It’s so nice to see them like this, before the onset of Seasonal Affective Disorder.
Too bad she's 13 years old.
And to think they met through Timber.
He's a lumberjack, but he's o.k.
they look so harmless without their chainsaws
Did you ever notice how there are no Black people in these smug New Yorker drawings!!
I love this time of year when the shirts turn plaid.
He has a ring? I have 287.
I think those two are getting ready to put down some roots.
If they fall down and we are not around, will it make a sound?
From deep red tartans to bright yellow plaids, I just love the changing of their colors in the fall.
"Oh, no....it's ok, they're harmless, they only dress like lumberjacks these days
That's weird, they were both here yesterday with someone else.
I love watching the clothes change in fall.
Aah, empty nesters, just like us.
Wow, two people who are actually not looking at their phones!
It's so hard to tell the male and female of the species apart ...
Can you believe we’re going to be in the Lands End catalog
Nice but I thought the colors were more vibrant last year.
I Love watching the shirts turn plaid.
Sometimes I wonder if they have feelings too!
...and ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough for sexual activity.
As touching as that is, those shirts smack of chain-saws.
You know when the plaid flannels come out, it's officially time to start shedding
They make the most wonderful fertilizer.
It's Fall! Their LLBean order came in.
I remember when we were courting: just a couple of nuts in love...
I like it better when they don't bring the dogs.
Ah, to be young and rootless.
Reminds me of us, 267 years ago.
The sight of them makes me a little sappy
I'm so glad I found you on Timber.
I’m jealous ... of his beard !!
We were once like that, but then we grew apart.
We are definitely in peak flannel season.
And to think a plaid shirt used to be the last thing a tree ever saw.
Don’t you just love the dogless ones, Hazel?
That could be us, you know, if you were willing to uproot.
That's so sweet. I give them until our leaves fall.
I hope that’s us in a hundred years.
Hey, I remember those folks, they're the ones who turned mom into a cozy log cabin.
You should see how they pollenate.
That's leaf... leaves leave lovers lean.
Is it just me, but I get all sappy when I see young love.
At times like this I wish I weren't self-pollinating.
I love the Fall. The people turn such pretty plaid colors.
Ah, love... Sorry, I turn into such a sap this time of year.
I love watching the flannel change colors.
It's so romantic when the flannels change color.
It's lovely when the fall plaids come out.
This is going to sound sappy...
See? I knew you'd like it. It's called "walking", and they do it everywhere outside of Los Angeles.
I am so glad they don't own a dog.
How sweet, they’re grafting.
Thank God they don't read newspapers, magazines or books anymore!
So nice to see a wanted sexual advance for a change.
I love it when they turn plaid in October.
Awww, I was beginning to think the ones without cell phones were extinct.
Amazingly, their kind must grow the woody before they can plant it.
Who would've thought we'd end up as extras in a Viagra commercial.
They met on plaid.com.
The plaid is much nicer when they don't have axes.
Courtship looks ridiculous. Thank God for pollination!
I wait all year to see those vibrant Fall plaids.
I love when they turn all plaid this time of year.
Did you ever notice that when our leaves turn colors their shirts turn plaid?
They have emotions and can even feel pain. Listen when I drop this branch on them.
Gosh, it seems like only yesterday that they were hugging us.
Oh, I so love watching the fall plaidiage.
I love when they get their fall colors.
I remember when he used to 'climb' me!
Cheer up, your hair loss is only seasonal.
I see a sapling in their future.
Such beautiful plaid this time of year!
Plaid is my favorite season.
Tell your doctor if you have botanical hallucinations lasting longer than four hours
It won't last - they have no roots.
I see she managed to spruce him up a bit.
You can tell how old they are by the width of their tummies.
See! I told you that they cross pollinate. That's clearly a different guy from last week!
Just makes you want to carve your initials in them, doesn't it.
Don't you just love people-huggers?
Just a few more years and they will become a boxed meal for us.
You may call me a sap. But that never gets old.
It will never last. They have no roots.
The plaids are particularly colorful this year.
He's a hipster, not a lumberjack. Close call!
You grab the tall one, and I'll carve our initials.
They fell in love on a bridge made from mom.
And just think a few years ago he was happy just to take a pee on me.
This area is the best for viewing the fall plaids.
I really like these new kindler, gentler lumberjacks
Love is so much more enjoyable when it’s not being carved it into my side.
Reminds me of our sapling days.
Ahhhhh, they're going to pollinate.
I'm glad they left their dog home this time.
I'd give ten nuts to keep a head of hair like that through December
Did you know, they can do it - without bees!
Just think...in 30 more years our branches will be close enough to do that
I love this part of the commercial before the announcer mentions the four-hour rule.
We're almost there, just keep pretending like those trees don't have any faces.
Isn't it beautiful how they change to plaid every fall?
We're not the only ones who will be adding a ring this year.
Let's carve our initials in the bearded one.
Sure they look happy now, but give them a couple hundred years.
I’ll miss them when they move to Brooklyn.
Remember when we were just twigs?
No dog, that's a relief
Aw, remember when we cross-pollinated?
Looks like he finally talked with his doctor about Cialis.
Ah, to be 150 again.
I just love autumn. Humans in plaid are spectacular this time of year.
I heard they have a funny way of pollinating.
They make a lovely couple. I hope his wife doesn't find out.
I love peak-flannel season!
No one knows why the shirts turn plaid in the fall, but I'm sure glad they do.
Young love. How sweet! I see the cartoonist can't draw hands.
Side effects include hallucinations about talking trees and the desire to wear plaid.
I love watching the flannel change colors this time of year
Times like these make me really wish we could warn them about the wolves.
It's nice to see L. L. Bean doing so well again this Fall!
I told you not everyone in flannel is evil.
The flannel has come late this year.
Ever thought about having a “treesome”?
Oh, to be plaid and rootless, if only for a day.
If a couple falls in love in a forest, do they make a sound?
Must be fall. The shirts are turning plaid.
Sure he’s older - cut him open I bet he’s got 20-25 more rings than she does.
Oh, thank god. I thought they were lumberjacks.
Aww, he has his limb around her.
I think the LSD is kicking in.
Let's just enjoy them while they're still here.
Loving in fall again.

I love seeing the plaid colors this time of year.
You can tell their age by counting the stripes.

Don't look up. Keep walking. Act naturally.
I love it when their hair turns colors.
I can never tell when hipsters are being ironic.
Thank G-d they left that stupid leg lifting mutt home.
Whew! Hipsters. Thought they were lumberjacks for a second.
Even the trees are laughing at these ridiculous shirts you bought us.
Aw, you could almost forgive their carbon footprint.
Fall colors. I'm a sucker for fall colors.
Isn't it odd how their favorite time of year is when we're dying?
Ah, love between the young and the rootless.
How quaint - a same-race, heterosexual couple.
I gotta say, those were the best brownies you've ever baked.
Ah, to be saplings again.
Remember when he was a kid he used to pee on you?
Phew. False alarm. No lumberjacks here. Just millennials.
Doesn’t take much to make me feel sappy.
My cousin in Miami brags about the year-round beachwear, but I like the change of seasons.
They're cute but rootless.
It won't last - they have no roots.
Yes, it IS lovely, but I fear we are simply in a drug ad.
We'll all be naked soon.
Oh, those plaid flannels! I just love looking at their fall colors!
I love autumn when the plaids come out.
What a relief! No more carving hearts into us...now they just get tattoos.
Ahhhhh.......to be a sapling again.
Is this their idea of morning wood?
That lumberjack look creeps me out.
I love this time of year when their foliage turns to plaid.
I like the lumberjack look... as long as it doesn't give them any ideas.
You’d almost think that they don’t realize they’re giving us all that lovely CO2.
Hey, the autumn plaids are out.
They just agreed to go with the bamboo flooring.
I love the shades of flannel this time of year.
They remind me of us before we grew apart.
I love their colors this time of year.
Just keep walking. Don't make eye contact, and we might make it out of here.
So which one's the pistil and which one's the stamen?
It's so adorable that they can pollinate all year long.
I hope they spend the evening in front of a warm natural gas fireplace.
I cant decide which is prettier this time of year - Tattersall or Tartan.
There they go again, taking their arms and legs for granted.
It looks like someone's getting pollinated.
I hear they actually get to touch each other when they have sex.
I sure am glad that they left the dogs at home.
They seem so happy. I wish I could fall on them and kill them both.
They look so happy... they probably haven't read today's news yet.
Royal Stewart and Black Watch! I just love the fall colors.
They are cute, yes. But if they try and carve their names into us, this is going to get real ugly.
I love fall when their shirts turn to flannel!
See? I told you not to worry - he only looks like a lumberjack.
Sure they seem nice, but tomorrow they'll be turning us all into tongue depressors.
No offense to them, but I hope they don't make it to their paper anniversary.
... and you thought we were sappy.
I love to see the seasons change. First the flannel, then the fleece, next thing you know it's full goose down.
Look, they're turning silver.
Isn"t that cute, he has his branch around her.
Isn’t it beautiful when all the plaids start changing color?
and when their coverings turn plaid you know it's fall....
Whew, no dog today. The relief is all ours.
See, I told you, when there with females they never pee on us!
I'm just happy taking selfies has replaced carving initials into us.
"Will you still love me when I lose my leaves?
I love watching the people change this time of year.
I think they are about to pollinate
I love to see the colors when their flannel grows back.
They're either alive with the sound of music or haven't heard yet who the new EPA chief is.
Nice limbs!
OK, if you fall down now, you will make a sound.
Look like they are ready to put down roots.
It won't be long until all four of us are going to be naked.
Reminds me of us when we were saplings.
Ignore the trees. Their bark is worse than their bite.
I love that nowadays, "lumberjack" is more of a fashion statement than an occupation.
If one of them falls in the woods do you think it makes a sound?
It looks like they're getting ready to put down some roots.
I think he's too old for her. Let's cut him in half and count the rings.
I love the colors their shirts turn this time of year.
You can't beat the colors they wear this time of year.
the beauty of autumn's plaids gets me every year
This is cute, until they etch their initials in us.
It amazes me how he can keep all that hair through the winter.
I think my leaves are falling for her, too.
Fall colors, beard, Burberry...wanna bet they drive a Subaru?
Just think -- in a few more years, they'll be fertilizer!"
I don't like them leavesdropping on us.
I love the fall flannelage season.
I remember when we were young and sappy.
Do those trees have faces?” “See this is why I said we should avoid parks near nuclear test sites.
And they said we were sappy...
Makes we wonder what things would have been like if we hadn't grown apart.
Thank God they're past the "carve our initials in a tree " stage.
Their foliage is so pretty this time of year!
Okay, I get it. Being able to move has its advantages.
Do you remember when they used to hug us like that?
Aaah... A breathe of fresh carbon dioxide.
Awww, they're even sappier than we are.
He's definitely getting plaid tonight.
I wish we could do that.
I give them two seasons.
Do you wonder if they'll ever want to really put down roots?
I hope someday we'll grow that close.
Remember when we were young saplings? We couldn't keep our branches off each other.
I'll never understand why walking by us is romantic.
Oohh so that’s what “lumber-sexual” means.
Wow, someone actually doing what they say they like to do in an online dating ad.
They are only smiling because we don't have a dog.
He isn’t the only one with a woody, Sylvia!
Funny how as we slowly get naked, the humans find it romantic.
She's the one. I can feel it in my nuts.
Follow the mellow chick road.
It seems like only yesterday he was carving their initials into my father.
Look, more lumbersexuals!
See, not everyone in a flannel shirt is out to get us.
Don't worry, they're not lumberjacks, just hispters.
The humans look so pretty in the fall.
Isn't it beautiful how their hair changes color?
Watching them makes me so sappy.
They remind me of us many growth rings ago.
Their roots are closer, but not as deep.
I'll bet you their sap is running
I think they're fallin for each other.
I miss the days when they were hugging us instead.
If I had an apple and this was Oz, I’d show them a thing or two,
No need to fret--there hasn't been a real lumberjack near Central Park West since the first Roosevelt administration.
I still look at your trunk that way, too!
Flannel is the world's way of telling us it's time to fall.
My arborist said it was normal for flannel with a beard to give me the shakes.
Let's both yell TIMBER and watch them run.
It's not your imagination. When you're smiling the whole world actually does smile with you.
If they fell over, do you think we would hear them?
Yes, but will she still love him in the fall, when all his hair falls out.
That stuff on his face is changing color, too. Wonder when it'll fall off?
I love seeing the plaids change in the fall.
Hey dude, she was walking with another guy yesterday!
Cute. And I hear their hair doesn't fall out every October either.
Looks like we're not the only ones around here with wood
Should we carve our initials on them?
It's almost like a New Yorker cover.
Good to see they have no axe to grind.
Look, they're going to pollinate soon.
Adorable. But I do wonder how they make love.
I wonder if their hair falls out in autumn.
I love watching their shirts change to plaid this time of year.
I love it when the shirts change to plaid.
Hug ME! Hug ME!
How sweet, New Yorkers' in autumn.
They seem to be enjoying themselves more than the joggers.
Interested in a treesome?
Now, there goes a family tree in the making.
Should we tell him he sat on his chocolate granola bar back there?
Oooooh, I love when the season turns to plaid.
If you look carefully, you can tell their age by the lines on their shirts.
Someday, our branches will touch, too
Don't you love these L. L. Bean photo shoots?
Where do they hide their seeds?
We’ll see if they’re still smiling when they hear you got me a chain saw for my birthday.
Still so sweet! Glad the dog is gone, though.
That's the bastard that chopped down my sister- I'll KILL him!
Maybe I can say it best with a Joyce Kilmer poem.
How come you never fondle my leaves like that ?
Now that we've carved smiley faces into those trees...what do you want to do next?
I hope he's not interviewing her for a job.
The plaids are exceptionally beautiful this fall.
I'm so proud of her. She married a tree surgeon.
She calls it a nature walk. He calls it the green mile.
I love Autumn and watching solid tops turn plaid.
Aw, so THAT's what our branches are for!
Okay, keep moving. Just act natural. Are they still smiling at us?
Our leaves will not be the only things falling today.
Are they falling in love or loving in Fall?
Remember when they gouged their initials in your back?
I bet they don't know that was poison oak.
Hey, check out the canopy on the dude!
A rare sighting of the Urban Lumberjack!
I sold the chainsaw today.
It's finally the season where one can both be and see sappy
I hope he falls for her and never leaves.
"Look Treesa, they look so happy"..."yeah, by next year it'll be the autumn of their discontent".
Don't they look majestic when they turn plaid?
How sweet, I think they're getting ready to pollinate.
It won't last. Their plaids don't match.
They look like they just stepped out of a L.L. Bean catalog. And we'll soon become one.
I know it the lumberjack look, but I’m really more of a treehugger.
If I see one more plaid shirt, all my leaves will fall.
Flannel is my favorite time of year.
Our relationship is more firmly rooted.
Looks like someone may be getting ready to put down roots.
It must be so nice to not be in a long distance relationship..
Yay! The Lumberjacks walked right by us!
These might be perennials!
I always wanted to live in prescription drug commercial.
I love autumn colors, especially plaids.
I just love it when the shirts change colors
They're still in love after 25 rings.
Phew, always a relief when they pass by without carving initials.
I love how they turn plaid in the Fall.
Look at those red flannel shirts -- I love seeing the fall colors.
Please remember, Tom, that with New Wave Feminist Misandry any form of expressed affection by a male to a female is classified as sexual harassment. But yes, in answer to your question, marriage to you would be a convenient arrangement.
How cute, I bet they use both sides of the paper when they print.
Don't worry, those are the friendly lumberjacks.
I really like his face foliage.
Hey, would you guys like a treesome?
...My family history says they were much more interesting before they had to put clothes on...
False alarm. They’re just lumbersexuals.
Why don’t you ever put your limb around my trunk?
They leaf each other very mulch.
I see the antidepressant fertilizer is working.
What a lovely couple. I give them three months, tops.
Awwwwwww - look! The shirts are starting to change to plaid flannels. Isn't fall the best time of year?
Its always sweet when they talk about putting down roots.
In my hippie days I'd hug them.
We would pine for love too, but we're deciduous.
We used to be close that.
Of all the couples who have horrifically and painfully scarred my torso with their initials, I like them the most.
It will never last...their plaids don't match.
I don't think we got the placebos.
I love this time of year. The shirts are so colorful.
Check that out. Another beard grows in Brooklyn.
I just love fall colors on a people lined lane.
I love the fall... the colors on those plaid shirts.
They'll make beautiful acorns.
Ah love - that contagious human disease - usually cured by marriage.
Aaah look--they're leaving!
See? We're not the only sappy ones around here.
Two of the fifty shades of plaid.
They think this is a L. L. Bean advertising shoot.
I love watching their foliage turn plaid this time of year.
I always know it's fall when I see flannel.
I say they get two rings each before dying.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one with Xanax
It's like they don't have a care in the world. They must not have internet, TV or a newspaper subscription.
Should we tell him she just lifted his wallet?
He's a tree hugger, but it is always done in an appropriate manner.
Such a sweet couple - I'd hate to tell them they've stepped in dog crap.
Even the trees are happier in Canada.
I think that's a Christmas sweater; we better warn the pine trees.
They must have no idea we can read their minds.
Let's tattoo our initials on their butts!
I thought you should know; I have Dutch Elm Disease
Sure, they're cute for a while, but then, hey, they're dead, and we've got another couple hundred years.
No I'm not crying, these are leaves of joy.
I love watching their colors change.
Just don't mention I am a lumberjack
All's clear! They didn't give us one of those tacky heart tattoos this time.
Romantic, but not well grounded.
I don't know about you, but I'm rooting for them.
So happy they didn't carve their initials into us.
It's Bob Ross, look happy!
They planted us in kindergarten!
They're so pretty when they start to show their fall plaid.
Phew! They're just hipsters, not actual lumberjacks.
The flannels are especially beautiful this year.
You think they also found each other on Timber?
Makes me feel romantic. I wish we could carve our initials on their trunks.
Watch his hand, we will find out if he is a Senator shortly.
I just love all the different shades of flannel this time of year.
I'm really rooting for them.
If you have wood more than four hours, call your doctor immediately.
I hear they have a peculiar method of pollination.
They're heartwarming but rootless.
It’s our lucky day, the lumberjacks are in love.
It's so cute when nature lovers dress like lumberjacks!
I just hope they're not initial carvers.
Nice to see him without an axe for once.
Poor Dorothy. She keeps meeting scarecrows.
There's just something Nature likes about mis-matched flannels.
Awww, it's touching to see there's still people who remember fall is more than just pumpkin lattes.
I love to see the humans in their autumn colors.
They carved their initials in my twenty years ago... and I still hate them.
...and after it falls out, it doesn't grow back.
My history teacher told us that going along like this was cool before cell phones were invented.
Remember when people dressed like that would chop us down?
Wow; different genders. Haven't seen that in a while.
Next fall I’m turning plaid.
I've never been on the set of a Viagra commercial before!
That's how they start pollinating!
Ah, the first plaids of the season!
I owe them everything. They planted me.
He’s a lumberjack, and he’s okay.
Personally, I think a little distance is healthy.
They’re transplants, just like us.
Looks like they're going to start their own family tree.
How about a treesome?
Don't you just love the fall when the hipsters turn to plaid?
Call me sentimental, but this kind of sight always brings sap to my eyes.
I think their rings mean something different.
They remind me of us before I back-talked that wizard.
It seems like only yesterday that they carved their initials in your butt.
It’s so endearing when the male cone and female cone get along so well
I never thought love would come between us.
They remind me of our first L.L. Bean cover shot together.
Oh, look hon, they have coordinated outfits too.
I love this time of year with the changing of the flannel
We don't get many tree huggers around here any more...
Remember how we felt when we were young in our 120's?
Side effects may include talking trees and thoughts of suicide.
Let's skip the pleasant-trees and get down to business
I just love the way their clothes change color in the fall!
Isn't it beautiful, Marge? It's the height of the plaid season!
I just love it when they get sappy.
It's nice moments like this that make me forget I'm covered in bugs.
And they say we're sappy.
I wonder how many rings they have.
Sure she looks happy - but she'll never have as many rings as I do
Ah, just look at them. Aren't their fall colors beautiful?
If nearby trees smile for more than four hours, contact your doctor.
I wonder what pharmaceutical company we're working for this week?
Lions and tigers and plaids, oh my!
Great color this season
Liberals are just so cute, and they'd never ever dream of building houses out of us, or burning us in their fireplaces.
Think of all the small talk we’ve missed out on because we self-pollinate
That reminds me, I just entered the erectile dysfunction season of my life.
They say that trees can talk to you mostly when you're high or just plain insane.
Let them be. Tree's a crowd.
I always get so sappy around the holidays.
They're going to have beautiful acorns.
I’ve a feeling we’re not in Central Park anymore, Dorothy.
I like this one. He’ll only use a gas fireplace.
Cute, but if he comes back here to carve their initials in me, I'm dripping sap in his hair.
Their colors are so pretty this time of year
I think that I shall never see, a poem as lovely as he and she...
How sweet. He just carved their initials on my butt.
They're so cute when they're uprooted
It's a shame they'll never put down the roots we have.

The last few autumn holdouts are almost gone. Let's enjoy the last gasps of seasonal plaid while we still can.
I hear their bite is worse than our bark.
Aah, look... consensual physical contact.
I remember when Bob Ross painted these trees.
The trees are happy because we're wearing LL Bean.
I always get sappy when I see them together.
The trees had never before revealed their ability to speak, but the chance to ask Jason, "If that's your wife, who did we see you making out with yesterday?" was too good to pass up.
Should I worry that when I’m famous you’ll accuse me of unwanted touching?
It seems like only yesterday they were K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
I really love to look at the fall coat colors.
What a beautiful sight: two lumberjacks with their hands in their pockets.
We dig your carbon dioxide, but your methane... not so much.
Just wait until their leaves fall off. Then things get really exciting.
Spoiler Alert! I know who dies in the end.
They're sappier than we are.
Awe? Remember when we dropped leaves on their great great great grand-parents?
Back in the day, I was hugged by someone like that, and it saved my life.
I told you the acid would make it more fun.
I've always enjoyed pathetic fallacies.
I get a woody just looking at them

Aww, they'll be putting down roots next!
I love seeing their torsos turn to plaid in Autumn!
If one of us falls, would they even notice?

Monday, November 7, 2016
Gets me sappy every time.
I love it when they start to wear flannel.
Well I’m certainly rooting for them.
Great chemis-tree!
They look like they'll be getting their rings soon just like we did.
I'm telling you, he looks exactly like my Dad.
It must be great to move too fast for woodpeckers.
How beautiful! I believe its called flannel.
Day 7 and they still don't know we're broccoli!
Ah, love. Walks in the park with that special someone. But where is his wife?
Reminds me of that movie, 'When Deciduous Met Conifer.'
Ah, to be young and in love and untroubled by global warming.
Before there were hipsters, seeing all that flannel would have made me wet my roots!
Don't they look sweet and woodsy? Just like they did when we were saplings
It's sweet until you realize they're lumberjacks.
Oh, yes, Maple! The fall patterns are particular striking this year, aren't they?
These lovebirds cut down an entire tree to make their nest!
They don't change color, but do they seem to add more bark at this time of year.
I might be going out on a limb, but they look like tree huggers!
He's not losing his foliage, but it sure has changed color.
I love the new tree emojis.
There will soon be another branch on the family tree.
Of course I'm invited to the wedding. My father fell on his father.
Aww, how cute. It's his first ex-wife
I prefer these hipster lumberjacks to the real thing.
It's heartwarming to see a couple still in love during their autumn years.
I really like the shirts they wear in the fall.
How nice to be in love and oblivious to climate change.
Aww, do you two have to leaf so soon?
Humans are so cute. Too bad they don't live longer!
They probably fuck to Mumford and Sons
I just love people-peeping season when the flannel comes out.
Are they leaving us already?
Keep absolutely still. Their vision is based on movement.
Remember our first Tinder date?
Don’t you just love all the plaid colors in the Fall?
Used to be the lumberjack crew, now it's just J.Crew
Honey, what did you put in my drink?
Ok, here's one. If a human falls in their apartment ...
I hope they put down roots.
#fall #thankful #blessed #failedrelationshipsofinstagram
Don't you think it's about time we put down roots?
Don't listen to them. I've never ever harmed a tree.
Love is okay for humans but we have photosynthesis.
That's her third date this week, so she must be very poplar...get it?
I think they're loving in fall !
Don't be fooled by the beard and flannel—the only axe he has is a body spray.
When the woolen plaids start appearing I'm filled with the urge to bare my limbs!
I wish we had arms.
Such happy little people!
They'll grow apart. We did.
It seems like just yesterday they were sitting in me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
Say, would you two happen to be tree huggers?
They look so innocent; you'd never dream they own a lumber mill.
I just love the Fall colors.
In 40 years, he will wish he never touched her in that way.
Love , human and deciduous
I love the flannel season; it's so colorful.
There was a time when a man with a beard in a flannel shirt was a danger to us...
Ah, to be young and uprooted.
Is it my imagination, or are there trees smiling at us?
Goodness, they look happy enough to put down roots.
Peak season for flannel-peeping!
Rest easy. They'll eternalize the moment on social media.
Should we tell them they're too close together to get full sun?
Yes, it's sweet, but what I like more is that when they're together, he seems to forget all about that damned axe!
Act natural and keep smiling. I heard he was an axe murderer.
It’s my favorite time of year, when the white people don their fall flannels.
Follow the plain white road, follow the plain white road
Somehow, our fall walks are even more pleasant with all the pharmaceuticals in the groundwater.
It's okay honey, just pretend they're not there
See! When their shirts turn plaid it's time for us to drop our leaves.
Their clothing is very colorful this time of year...
Before medical marijuana, I thought these walks were stupid.
Remember when they were still just saplings?
What. No Timberlands?
Thank you for not carving your initials into me!
Humans...they are so sappy sometimes!
We should stop taking psychedelic drugs before our walks.
I remember when they were just a couple of saplings.
Yes, I also find the senescence of the humans to be charming
When will they ever leave?
I remember when they were just two saplings.
They haven't changed since we were saplings.
Their fear of being alone is so beautiful this time of year.
I know, I didn't used to think I'd like to live in a Disney world either.
You know, if we cut these trees down, we could make beautiful speaker cabinets." "Oh, babe, I love how much you treasure nature.
They're so adorable before they put down roots.
I told you that plaid season would be lovely this year.
Welk, we can always hope their kids will be tree huggers...
If a tree were to mock ugly plaid shirts, would anyone hear it?
Hey you two! Are you swingers?
It almost makes me want to forgive them for carving their initial in me years ago.
Darling, I fear our relationship is checkered.
It's that couple the Aspens have been whispering about!
The cutest part is when they shed their leaves, too.
Maybe they’ll put down roots together
I wish we could get closer!
He's a she, and she's a he....and they're happy as a tree.
Their clothes turn such lovely colors this time of year.
Tree huggers in love. It brings tears to my eyes.
Don't you love it when their shirts change color?
I just love how their sleeves change this time of year.
Those humans--sometimes it looks like they almost use a language to communicate.
No axe. Bonus.
Being a redwood would be great and everything, but I’d miss the change of wardrobes too much.
Any moment now, I expect music out of nowhere.
I talk to the trees too, but they don't usually talk back.
Hey! I just spotted an endandered species.
I read a book that says they feel and communicate just like us... But I really wanted to know if there sap can be boiled down into sugar.
What happened to us? We used to do that, and then we somehow grew apart
Ooooo! I love the color their plaids turn this time of year!
Seems like only yesterday they were climbing us!
I love seeing them in their fall colors and I try not to think about them dying..
You can tell their age by counting their wrinkles.

I'm rooting for them.
Love makes my leaves drop.
Look1 The new L.L. Bean shirts
Cute, but I'm not crazy about the lumberjack style.
Look at all the different colors! The changing of the flannels is my favorite time of year.
If a tree smiles at you in the forest and you don't sees it, is it really happy?
Somehow they know I’m a certified arborist.
They're so beautiful... I just want to carve our initials into them.
This can't be a New Yorker cartoon, it's too normal.
I wish we could do plaid.
We can stop dropping leaves now. Eve must've finally got approved for that LL Bean credit card.
“I don’t think her mother meant marrying a tree surgeon.”’
These millennials just can't seem to put down any roots.
Thank goodness he’s found someone else to chain himself to!
I just love the autumn plaids, don't you?
I told you, Chris, not everyone wearing plaid is mean to us.
Do you ever get the feeling that you're being watched?
I remember us like that, before our reincarnation.
"Yeah, but my sap is good on pancakes".
If you ignore the disgusting way they reproduce, it's almost cute.
Awww, that's so sweet. It makes me want to leave.
It's hilarious when they plant seeds.
They only love us for our CO2.
Our leaves fall on lovers again, but hey, we'll outlive them both!
I love when the autumn colors come out, especially the plaids.
They make me want to reach your roots.
Reminds me when we were mere saplings
If I could I would.

Are they still watching?
I love it when they change colors in autumn -- such pretty plaids
You see the faces too?
My wager? Married in a year, divorced in three. How 'bout you?
He's a lumberjack, but he's o.k.
If a human falls in the woods does it make a sound?
Falling for you
Don't you love fall and giving these people Lyme Disease.
At some point we have to tell them that they’re on the site of our new dream house.
If a tree falls on a couple in the park, do they make a sound?
Whose woods these are you think they know?
Okay, just drop a few more leaves --- there. Perfect romantic setting.
I wonder if they'll last through the flannel phase
Will we be like that three hundred years from now?
Humans look so amazing in the fall.
I love the pretty colors humans wear in the fall.
Every fall, trees travel to the Northeast to watch relationships change.
Why don't you make like a tree and leave- hahaha
Maybe we can't walk, but at least we having matching tops.
I like her because she calls him "Woody."
And he hasn't swung an axe since.
The way they dress alike reminds me of us.
Don’t worry Peggy, global warming will make it all go away soon.” “The trees or matching flannel?
Don't you just love fall, when they change to their plaid doors?
Awww ... they'll be putting down roots any day now.
They're about to cross-pollinate!
They're whispering to you, Louise.
Every fall it's fun to leavesdrop on their conversation.
They remind me of us as saplings.
They can be so lovely. I just wish they would go to another planet.
Symptoms may include bleeding from the mouth and intense vomiting.
Ahhh... My favorite time of year is leavesdropping.
Ah. Looks like we all got wood.

May the leaves of love fall at your feet.
Except for us, nobody does Autumn better than LL Bean and J Crew.
Nature and chill
We're ALL plaid inside, dear.
I'm glad Elisabetta and Bartholomew only carved their initials.
Honestly, it just sounds boring Bob — nobody wants to watch a guy painting on tv.
Love me or leaf me.
Do you think the trees ever wish they could wear plaid?
I'm hugging you too, but it's with my roots!
Let's branch out and make our own little twigs
happy little people
Once he leaves, want to have a treesome?
Their plaids don't hold a candle to ours.
Why don't you ever put your limb around me?
Plaid season is so colorful!
The Autumn plaids are so vibrant this year!
Do you think I would look good with a beard?
What a cool guy, his hair is just like ours.
They're so cute I can almost forgive the lumberjack look.
It stumps me, but I just feel sappy when lumberjacks fall in love.
I'll never leaf you.
Imagine how awkward - four trunks, joined at the top, and moving.
On day, they’ll make a house out of us.
What do you think... if a human falls in love in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it still make a sound?
I like the silent type too.
Sometimes different plaids crossbreed.
Looks like true leaf, to me.
I wood.
I've taken my medication . . I'm telling you the trees are saying, "Follow the Yellow Brick Road."
On day, they’ll make a house out of us.
I’m secretly planning to accuse you of inappropriate contact thirty years from now.
They all look like lumberjacks, but not one of them knows one end of an axe from the other.
If this isn't a "Cialis Moment", then I don't know what is!
And to think, only one Giving Tree had to give its life for their happiness.
Doesn't that guy remind you of Bob Ross?
Did you just bark?
A pair of plaids. Don't we just love the fall colors.
You may also wish to submit your thesis online.
I wish we could hug each other too.
Are you getting sappy too?
I didn’t know they come without wires.
as I was saying, to have something sweet, you have to get the lid offf the Maple syrup ....
Chuck, don’t worry: your secret’s good with me.
Pretend you don't hear them. We're almost home.
Let's make like a lumberjack and split.
I know they’re creepy - just keep smiling...
I'm not positive, but the shrooms might be kicking in now.
I'm glad that lumberjack found someone else to occupy his time with
Someday, I would like to take a walk among the people
He’s pretty sweet, for a lumberjack.
They met on TreeHarmony.com
I love all the plaids at this time of year.
They dropped a branch on my last boyfriend--they approve.
True love.... I just hope they don't carve their initials on me.
Aren't the colors of the plaids lovely this time of year?
Oh, they’re both wearing plaid! I love the autumn colors.
Look, he's falling for her...
It's just their way of telling you to get rid of the beard.
So nice to see them putting down roots.
Is it just me, or do you also feel like pelting them with acorns?
It's cute how Autumn brings out their colors...
Sensible shoes? Check.... L. L. Bean shirts? Check.... Silver hair among the gold? Check.... Still friends after 20 years of marriage? Check.... Well, Sassafras, you're absolutely right! They DO match the demographic profile for tree-huggers.
They grow up so quickly!
Those two have never seen their love fall like our leaves in an Autumn breeze. What you got a woody?
Another romance for Eddie Bauer.
If only we were closer.
The urban lumberjacks are much less dangerous than their forest dwelling counterparts
They look pretty happy for being so rootless.
They're getting sarcastic. It's time to leave.
Is that you playing with my roots?
I never really wanted to be a thesis adviser anyway.
no electronics is a lot like LSD
When are they going to put down roots?
It's quite obvious, she used to be coniferous but now they're both deciduous.
I'm so glad they added emojis to the I-trees!
Some day I will tell you what they said about us
During mating season, lumberjacks are called "hipsters" and are perfectly harmless.
I guess our photosynthesis is pretty much history...
If your wood that lasts more than four hours, please consult a physician.
I love plaids, I wish I could wear them.
Seek immediate medical help if you experience nausea during sex or falling leaves.
Every time all our leaves fall off people pretend to get along for like a month.
I love it when they don’t carve initials.
All we need is for Maggie to add color!
They'll be having a little sapling soon.
I can't help feeling sappy this time of year.
Plaid has always been my favorite season.
What do you say we cut their hearts out and carve our initials on them?
To be perfectly honest, branches and leaves aren't Maggie's strong suit, and yes, we do look more like giant cauliflowers.
I like ‘em much better when they don’t carve their eternal love into our flesh.
If they do get married, I hope I become their coffee table.
Remember; plastic, metal, concrete or stone.....no wood!
Such a shame that next week several women will come out and say how he has harassed and groped them over the years.
I love to see their clothes changing. Such lovely blend of colors.
It's about time those two starting hugging something else besides us trees.
Of course you're dreaming...I'm 5'5", weigh 300 lbs., smoke smelly cigars, and don't wear GAP - ever.
Looks like someone's feeling a little woody.
Just think, in 150 years that will be us.
Let's just leaf them.
Ah finally, the plaid anniversary.
Follow the mellow chick road.
I think that I shall never see a pair as lovely as a tree.
I don't think I felt that acid
They're so like us before we put down roots.
And to think we’re plotting to assassinate this lumberjack.
I love the Fall colors.
They look so beautiful now in their fall colors, but when you see them through a window after they drop them it's a whole different story
...and to think, it wasn’t long ago that people in plaid flannel spelled certain death for us. God bless Kurt Cobain!
Don't turn around, but I think we're being watched.
These must be the Happy Trees that Bob Ross was always putting in his paintings.
I just love the colors this time of year!
Remember son, you can always time the coming of Autumn by when the flannel appears
They're so beautiful this time of year.
How nice to see plaids and it not be a lumberjack!
They are an indigenous species.
That's what we need - less lumberjacks, more 'Love her, Jack.'
They look so delicious already! I almost can’t wait until they’re ripe…
Oh, they're leafing us.
Don't you just love those Fall sweater colors?
I wish someone touched me like that.
They're so pretty. It's a pity their time is so brief.
I'm looking forward to wrapping my limb around you in a few decades
I'm so glad they aren't the "sitting in a tree" type!

I'm glad the lumberjack found something else to put his mind to.
I know I should say something inspirational, but I got nothin'.
Aw! Isn’t that sweet? And they haven’t even started rooting yet...
Reminds me of when we were just saplings.
This may sound corny, but I've fallen for you in a big way.
Ooh, honey, maybe you could grow a beard like he has!
Look at them, so cute...they have no idea hipsters are going out of fashion.
That sure was sweet how they carved their initials into you.
Maybe in 300 years, WE'LL be able to entwine our branches.
Sappy, isn't it?
Can you imagine looking so similar to someone else?
It is odd—normally they're grumpy this time of year.

Watch what they do next. They don't even need bees.
I think the Douglas-fir back there was flirting with you.
He's not carrying a knife.
Don't you hate them for carving these stupid faces?
Time flies. I remember when they were just saplings.
They're so cute, but will they be able to establish any roots?
My leaves blush red every time they pass us.
It's so rare these days...to see them holding each other, rather than cell phones.
That reminds me. Have we gotten our LLBean catalog?
They need to give each other more space
I guess those trees haven't checked Twitter this morning.
Remember our footloose and fancy free days?
It almost makes me want to forgive them for carving their initial in me years ago.
They're dioecious, too! But they can't make nice berries...just babies.
They can't make berries! Just babies.
Do you think someone's watching us?
Ah, takes me back to 1975. Our first cross-pollination!
They can be cute when you get them out of Brooklyn.
I see you are wearing your PBS shirt! Small checks!
Totally clueless about the lost art of carving hearts and initials.
They sure cleaned this place up after Dorothy, and Toto left.
He looks like ME!
Do you think something might have been up with the mushroom risotto?
In a few years I'll be able to hold your trunk.
The Animal Kingdom is awesome.
Mama and Papa always said that I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
They’ve been together since she made him join Axeaholics Anonymous.
They're so much happier now that Elphaba is gone.
This is a spectacular spot to watch the plaid shirts and grey hairs stroll by in the fall
Sure, we have a tough winter ahead to endure. But six months from now we'll be in the middle of the rebirth vibrance and hope. Such is the natural cycle of life here in Washington, D.C.
Pretend you didn't see them.
Congratulations.. Voted the worst Caption Contest Cartoon.. since the invention of the printing PRESS..
I think he's going to leave her....
L.L. Bean's Siamese Twins Fall Collection.
Sure they’re smiling- they don’t know about the cord of wood we just ordered.
I twig that they are going to branch out and tie the knot.
I talk back, but they don't listen to me.
Being rootless doesn’t seem like a total disaster ... I wonder if that’s just fake news?
Thank God he chose her over the dog.
It realize love is in the air, but I wish they would make like a tree and leaf.
Isn’t flannel season beautiful?
It IS kind of sickening!
I know, they don't fall; they're rejected!
They're even cuter when they hold hands from separate bathtubs.
Definitely NOT deciduous!
I just love seeing people fall in love this time of year.
The wind blows in many directions, but only god can make a tree.
With beards like that it's no wonder we shed our leaves!
I'm a pushover for sappy things.
Doc takes call at home from patient’s mother: “Try using the code word ‘Banana’ to calm him.”
If a tree smiled in the forest and no one saw it....
Love is all you seed.
Everyone loves plaid!
Beard season is upon us
I hope they never grow apart.
Thank goodness they're not barking at each other.
You have to love that old, classic L.L. Bean-catalog look.
If they really wanted to pollinate, they'd just stand here and let the wind do its thing.
"You create love and happiness all around you" ... nature agrees.
Honey, I think even the trees know our marriage is a sentience for life.
Don't you just love watching the patterns change?
It's only downhill from here!
I'll always root for a sappy love story!
Tropes, you see those leaves falling. They're not gliding by in pairs. This is nature and my papa been was a rolling stone. Chill, I can't be marrying you.
So you see, son, when the Mommy seed and the Daddy pollinator get really close, then a baby tree is born.
Someday, I will be able to wrap my limb around you.
My, what an idyllic scene we've helped to create.
Kiss her already!!
Romance, love, and they’ll probably be buried together which means more fertilizer for us.
New Love: the perfect reason for shedding our leaves. Better than last week when they were jogging through here with their nasty dogs.
They look happy. Let's leaf them alone.
United they stand. Divided we fall.
Those Barney's flannel shirts, the earthy tones, the planned unkemptness, the heir of entitlement. Don't you just love yuppie season?
I don't love you anymore, but isn't this a nice place?
When you drain the chlorophyll, that's what's left.
Sometimes I wish our relationship was as rooted as theirs...

It's a lot more peaceful around here since Paul joined Tinder.

I'd like to, but I plan on running for office some day.
Bet they fully shed before we do.
I guess there'll be some new tree huggers soon.
It must be nice to be able to leave whenever you want.
I feel like were being watched...
Now that we've both transgendered, who buys the groceries?
On a day like today, I can almost imagine that he was never even nominated.
Let's not tell them that I'm a lumberjack.
Have you noticed ? No kids, no phones, just us.
I wonder if he misses her most when autumn leaves begin to fall?
The trees are so nice this time of year.
I don’t know how much longer I can keep this ‘happy tree’ movement going.
The bad news is that she clearly wants a divorce. The good news is that having scoliosis finally paid off...
Trees smile because they don't have to rake.
Remember a time when it was not just a walk in the park?
Young love. I hope they are together when they get to be our age.
Now there's a lovely couple who can see the forest for the trees.
Though sorely tempted to make a sarcastic comment about how love never lasts, I resist the New Yorker impulse and just say: it makes me happy to see people in love.
Of course it’s nice for parents to see it happen, but I do hope he pops the question soon so we can get out of this ridiculous costume.
Vegans murder plants, Stanley—I'm a Breatharian!
The days grow short when you reach Septeember
I'm always glad when I see happy little people.

Isn't it fun being divorced?
So sweet, they don’t know that we sold the lot to developers
They're so cute when they put down roots.
That's why they call it 'falling in love!'
Soon the hipster will be decorating his beard for the holidays.
Such a Rossian afternoon, no?
Even the trees have eyes. Just act natural.
Ah, don't you wish you could hug them back?
Just ignore the talking trees, someone must've gave them too much fertilizer.
Oh, look, they're wearing Timberland...
Ok, Google, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
As we drop our leaves, it may induce him to lose that horrid beard.
So this is your happy place? I was thinking Bali.
Tree for Two
D'ya think he's got a woody?
Look, it's fall and THEY'RE not losing hair... though he seems to be covered in moss.
What a beautiful day---Let's do a Google search and try to find the kids.
I’d say your revenge plot against the woodcutter is going exactly as planned.
Following the yellow brick road is actually kind of creepy.
Hey, how 'bout you and I cross-pollinating later?
Whew. For a second I thought he was a lumberjack. Just a millennial.
You see, Maple? It's ok to match each other.
I love autumn and the falling of the lovers.
We'll outlive them.
Groom? He's not even trimmed.
It's a good sign we both like seasonal plaids, don't you think?
You're right – I'm imagining things. Trees don't really have faces and emotions … but, neither do cartoon characters.
I see the similarity to us – she leaves because he's a rake.
For a second, I thought that dude was wearing goggles.
There's some nice fall color on the humans.
I hate to see them go, but I love to watch them leaf.
Remember when they met while playing hide and seek around us.
Look how happy those trees are. You see? I told you the nuclear fallout wasn't all bad.
How do they twist their branches like that?
Ah, reminds me of our days as seedlings, doesn't it?
Sure they provide shade in the summer, but the eight-story parking garage the firm is building will work year round.
I never acknowledge them. They just want money for chlorophyll.
'That young actress will go a long way.'
Those shoes look like a fam.
Add erectile dysfunction to the list of reasons why I would never want to change places with a human being.
They're almost as sappy as we are.
Mate like a tree and leave.
We better dial back on the Xanagro.
Between you and me, they've got a hard road ahead.
Wouldn't it be romantic if they got beaten and robbed and buried right next to us?
They must have received our contribution to The Nature Conservancy.
Awww... it’s cuffing season!
Ahh! Had she won, they would hug us now.
Sure, they seem nice enough now, but they'll eventually turn on you.
Not lumberjacks, just hipsters!
Of course I'd never leave you.
I'm so glad they walked though the week we are the Enchanted Forest.
You’re just an old sap.
I love strolling through the Bob Ross Memorial Forest.
You know what they say: hate the lumberjack, love the shirt.
Every little Breeze seems to whisper Louise.
Awwww...lumberjacks in love!
I love this time of year, when all the colorful fall flannels are out.
They've known each other since elementree school.
A couple more leaves and I think he will pop the question.
Be-leaf me when I tell you, we're still rooting for humanity.
Ignore them. They're just a drug flashback from when we watched Fantasia.
You should see them in the spring.
You know it's fall when they wear their Pendletons!
No, Dorothy. Ents aren't real.
Remember when Donald Trump was just some egomaniac on a reality show we didn't watch?
Look like they are ready to put down roots.
When the giant Broccoli Aliens discovered Jim and Mary were vegans, they no longer came in peace.
The world is better without color
It hurts when they carve smiles!
You would think the CIA would be more subtle.
They look like they're about to put down roots!
I believe that much unseen is also here.
Too bad they can't wrap their roots around each other like we're doing?
Oh, Leif....I think he finally asked her to put down roots with him!
Looks like we won't be the only ones putting down roots.
Pay no attention. The're all bark and no bite.
Don't you just love seeing the colors of flannel shirts during Autumn?
??=????
Seems kinda late in the year for mating season.
I'm so relieved we decided to plant happy trees.
She can't see the forest for the tease.
Wearing flannel is so country
Looks like the erectile dysfunction autumn ad season has finally arrived.
At least they're better behaved than the neighbor's kids.
Spring is in the air?
Times like these are rare...I love you.
They look sappy.
Smile and stay calm, Norm. They may seem cute, but they’re dressed like lumberjacks.
They look so happy together. I wonder what secrets they're hiding from each other to maintain that joy.
Wow! That's what we were like before we saw the wizard!
You're now leaving Happy Forest. Have a nice life!
Don't you just love plaid.
“I just love it when the Fall colors come out.
Untucked and in love. How very, very ... now.
Trees R us ?? Love you!
T think they'll have great sex after Treealis.
...and to our credit: their sappiness comes from us.
Have you heard about this new anti-depressant? It has no side effects!
It’s so adorable when they pair-bond.
Don't worry honey. Just old college friends....
That's us in a hundred years.
Remember when we were just saplings and their grandparents walked down this lane!
Let's shed our leaves and show them how to do it.
Soon, they'll be putting down roots.
Don’t you love their colours this time of year?
I feel sorry for them. No roots.
Remember when WE were young lovers?
I see them bloom For me and you And I think to myself I hope he has her consent
Let's steal their underwear!
A creepy tranquility surrounds true believers in the Trump administration.
Remind me -- which trees have smooth leaves and are sentient?
Reminds me when we were just young saplings.
Hypothetically, their locomotion skills destabilizes their relationships?
Ah, the stunning fall plaids return.
Look, I guess we can Fall for each other too!
I love it when they show up in those bright coloured clothes and walk among us every fall.
I’ve been doing love therapy for a hundred years, all pro bono.
Makes you rethink self germination
That's it...you just keep walkin', lumberjacks.
They obviously didn’t read the directions on spacing.
... and you thought we were sappy.
We're in trouble if they think we're Dorothy and Toto...
You two look ready to put down some roots.
They’re turning mom into a custom headboard!
Now we are dating, what type of health insurance do you have?
I've never understood why they empty the nest, but save a nest egg.
Just keep smiling. They'll get theirs in the woods.
It's that time of year again: when their shirts get all ridiculous looking.
Lovely. Too bad they fade so quickly.
I do believe they are evergreens
Imagine having sap rise year round!
There they are, in their little flannel shirts, the harbingers of-Fall
I don't even care that I lost the bet now.
Like us, they’ll never leaf each other.
I don’t think the Trunks know winter is coming.
I've a feeling she's taken her back stabbing too far.
I'm just thinking the whole men's and woman's plaid theme may have been a mistake
It turns out all they needed was to be in a commercial for antidepressants to get over their depression.
How sweet...I heard he's gone out on a limb for her.
I love the colors of flannel.
Autumn in the New Yorker
The Ents applaud a proportionate plaid to plaid ratio.
So far, touching her on the shoulder is still ok.
I'm thankful for little things. Like when they don't painfully carve their initials into my flesh.
The original words were "Every little trees seems to whisper Louise" but it just wasn't grammatically correct.
Shel Silverstein's The Giving Tree is much less deranged when reimagined with a second tree and a second person.
The way things are going out there, I hope someone burns the wardrobe we came though.
They met at the Gap.
Best trail to see seasonal hipster foliage. Look at the burnt amber in that beard. And those flannels!
Wonder if they'll ever branch out?
But if you hadn't gone looking, there would be no place like OUR home.
I think she's Falling for him.
I told myself I wouldn't leaf.
it won't last
Keep walking, it's just a couple of reporters turning over a new leaf.
Don’t be such a birch. This may not be poplar, but they look pretty evergreen to me.
I lost count. Is the 5th or 6th guy since summer.
They look like nice people, but I'm so not into plaid.
Ah...gentrification...
...sure, they seem okay now, but let's see how they do in winter
Yes, dear, as soon as I can find a mirror.
Ah...to be rootless again.
I am so glad I moved. Everyone seems a lot happier here.
"Even your elders are happy for us".
They're smiling now , but just wait until they realize we're looking for firewood.
They are cute but, clashing plaids doesn't bode well for a long term relationship.
Nice to see saplings getting along.
Awww, look Robert! Young love. They're so cute at that age...
How sweet...in the autumn of their years too!
Leaves are leaving and they're falling for fall.
I remember when those two were mere saplings.
I know I might be sappy but I enjoy seeing a couple in love.
I hope she has had her shots.
Companionship
I'd really rather be walking on a warm, sandy beach.
But I dont want another dog.
Be careful, even the nice guys are part of rake culture.
Yes Karen, I received the settlement papers.
Those two make me beleaf in love.
I hear 'woodsy chic' is hot this season.
Do you remember when we were their age? We fell in love in the fall too.
I hope these two pollinate. Even though they dress like lumberjack and lumberjill.
I think they're cross pollinating now!
I can't wait for the day we finally start killing all the people. It's going to be awesome.
Grab her by the leafy!!
They both have a checkered past,I saw them this SPRING.
MmmHmm, that dude IS handsome...I don't know why all humans don't shape their hair like us!
Do you think they have even the slightest understanding of how those flannel lumberjack shirts make us feel?
they can't see the forest for the plaids. sweet.
Ahh...to be without roots...
Like I would drop all this for a man. What am I, a deciduous?
they may be happy now , but just wait until the fall
The humans are lovely this time of year.
What happens in the wood, stays in the woods. Not a word will leaf our lips. Our silence is rooted, and our bark is muted.
"A walking breathing Gap ad".
Sorry you're leafing. Hope you had a treemendous time.
I just won't look at an apartment with a fireplace. Trees are just like people and you wouldn't burn up your friends, right?
I think they could be the ones who planted us years ago...in a spring day in this park.
Hey, @realDonaldTrump- Love beats hate. Happy!
Will you still love me when I stop wearing plaid?
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference how deluded you are.....
Yes, yes I did find the divorce petition you left me.
With any luck, we'll soon have new humans to rake our leaves!
You'd never believe it's his 3rd wife.

Why don't we wait til spring?
That's the guy that cut down Fred!
They tiptoed through the tulips last spring.
Why don't they act like a tree and leave ?
I bet those trees are holding roots beneath the ground.
We ARE in Kansas Dorothy. These trees don't throw apples.
let's leave them alone
Love is like carbon dioxide.
Ah...looks like Dorothy and the Scarecrow finally got together...
Oh the thrill of deciduous love!
I wonder how they would like smiling leaves carved on their foreheads.
Do I have something on my pants? I was wondering the same thing.
You know and I know the trees don't really have faces.
Bill, you think these trees can talk?
There's a lot to be said for the way they "fall" too.
Check, mate!
Don't be concerned. Their bark is worse than their bite.
Isn't Portland fantastic?
It looks like they are 'Breaking Plaid.'
Don't just love Fall when the flannels come out.
I've branched out from being just a tree hugger.
Something in the back of my head just tells me your a back stabber.
This beats deer mating all to hell, as still have scars from that 10-point buck.
I bet he'll never leave.
Reminds me of the time a tree-hugger passed by.
Joyce Kilmer's poem was overrated.
Aww, the Yellow Brick Road is looking more like Portland every year.
Sometimes I think the tree wants to hug me back.
" I think I'm falling for you".
You can relax, Gladys, they're not real lumberjacks.
They're not really that happy for us; their wooden smiles give them away.
Humans have a much shorter life span, it's cute to see how often they rush into things.
Love this couple- they've sported every plaid but lumberjack.
Ahhhh, plaid tidings
Remember when optimism came naturally?" "No.
Everything is seasonal.
I know you’re just a student but I have so much knowledge and wisdom which can enrich your life.
You've never been sappier, hon.
Young love is so moving.
Oh dear, I'm so glad you finally got that job at the tree cutting company!" "Yeah, I can't wait to come back here tomorrow on the job to finally stop these trees from staring at us.
1982: Bob Ross takes a stroll through a park and the phrase "Happy Little Trees" just occurs to him out of the blue.
I’m so happy they’re cutting us down so we won’t see their demise.
How time flies. I remember when they were just little kids.
Love is in the air! The leaves are falling for the ground.
Gosh, I think they liked us !
Don't look now, but the trees are smiling!
How autumnal!
Don't leave us or Poor humans, they just can't put down roots.
My roots ache everytime someone walks on them.
Public pollination! How daring!
Oz is lots nicer now than it was back when I was a kid..
They say even fake smiles are healthy for you.
And they're reformed lumberjacks.
Don’t you just love the fall? When they always change their colors and patterns and political leanings every year.
Ah, peak hipster, don't you love this season?
We're off to see the wizard...for health insurance.
I love a good tartan - don’t you Maple?
I don’t care what you think...their shirts do clash!
Yeah, it's Fall, but Love has no season.
I always thought the trees would throw apples at us, didn't expect them to be this nice.
It looks like the are enjoying their time at the North Pole, another Trump success.
I love when the fall attire is in full bloom.
I like his hair.
Hey, plaid flannel shirts! Guess it’s time to drop some leaves!
Sometimes, when we take our walks in our lumberjack shirts, it seems the trees are grateful we aren't carrying chainsaws.
I hope they settle here and plant some roots.
Life is beautiful until the leaves need to be raked.
Even the trees beleaf that I really Fall for you.
Ahhh... my favorite time of year - Plaid!
It's the autumn of their lives, too.
No weeping willows here.
I've known them since I was a sapling.
Jackpot Jerry....we've got plaid...we've got flannel....we've got beard.......now don't mess this up....SHAKE IT 'TILL THEY RAKE IT!!!
I think it was plain old fruit punch. Why do you ask?
Margaret, why aren't you grieving?
I know it's sappy but...
Just think! In 50 years, we'll be together like that!
They're sweet but I prefer tree huggers.
He’s just a beard. She’s really a tree hugger.
Call off the squirrels! She consented to his shoulder squeeze.
Awww, Tulip, this takes me back to the first time we held roots.
I can't help but feel like we're always being watched
It's the fifth couple we've seen today. What is it about my leaves falling that brings this joy?
I'd love to be able to keep a full head of hair like that year round.
Remember when they weren't so damned nosey?
It's funny how different things look when you're in love.
Hey, you're finally losing some of that water weight!
And then they administered the Narcan
I wish they'd leaf us alone.
I'm such a sap for young love.
See, George I told you “ not all humans wearing flannels are lumberjacks”! You’re right Gorgè, some are just uber practicable and have found an effective way to wear pajamas all day!
Don't you wish we had potassium ion channels so we could go for a walk too?
How come we can't walk like that.
I love how romantic humans get this time of the year.
She’s the new girlfriend. See how they change with the seasons?
Ah, those were the days before we put roots down and had to leave it all the time.
And I thought I was sappy in the fall.
I've got it! Let's branch out.
Do you think we'll ever be that close Margaret?
Honey, where did you put the shopping list?
I love fall. Their shirts get so colorful!
I'm sorry, but this is personification taken to the extreme!
The trick is to stay in love while you grow apart.
D'ya think it's time we put down some roots?
Another win for big pharma!
i hope they don't think i'm groping you
Of course you can hug one of the trees, Harold, but remember, no fondling or groping.
I would have said something as they passed but wasn't sure which pronouns to use.
Every Fall the trees just come alive.
Love those tree-huggers; my branches are still shaking
Next time we see them there may be a sapling
Not only the hills, but the trees are alive with the sound of music.
If a tree smiles in the woods and there’s no one there to see it, does it condone a fashion fail?
Don’t worry, Bob. Tree-huggers are the new lumberjacks.
And 9 months later a little lumbersexual is born.
Aww, and in a few years we'll be roasting alive in their fireplace to provide romantic ambience.
Lets leaf these two alone
Don't look now, but I think we're being watched.
You walk ahead; I'm going to wipe that silly grin off their bark.
Bet they’re dreaming about more than the occasional prune job!
We're next, cuffing season has begun.
At long last I see a poem as lovely as a tree.
Beard, check. Flannel, check. Work boots, check. Axe, hahahahaha.
I sold the Charlie Rose DVDs.
Looks like a fashion stylist sold them a 2 for 1 deal!
Do you want to play checkers?
I guess flannels back in.
I love this season when the people's defenses change color and fall to the ground.
I just love his hair!
They’re missing out on true love until they put down roots.
"Happiness is rooted in Love".
They’re a cute couple, but those lumberjack tops are kind of creepy.
Sometimes you need to look away from the screens.
The way their branches are intertwined, can asexual reproduction be far behind?
Just smile and try to fit in.
They must not watch MSNBC.
She'll never leaf him.
in a few years this whole area will be under water !
Plaid has always been my favorite season.
I get so sappy over this sort of thing.
I'm thinkin' little acorns by Summer!
And they lived plaidily ever after.
You can tell their age by counting the number of wedding rings they have.
Aah...if she ever doubted his love, he said, once he buys her this land it'll be clear cut.
You know they don't feel anything when we hug them, right?
Parental bliss is when you leave the kids locked in the closet for a romantic weekend away rather than paying the babysitter a living wage.
Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
My favorite Fall color? Plaid.
I so look forward to seeing them in their fall colours.
Leaves schmeaves. They always return. But illusions walk this path just once.
Honey, I know I say this every year, but THIS has been the best Arbor Day
I feel much happier now that we left weeping willow park.
They do look a little familiar,but, I'm not really sure.
True love is like us trees. Never gonna change.
I don't know why people are so against the anthropomorphication of our urban parks.
There's nothing funny about this picture.
Call me sappy, but I love this time of year.
Isn't it nice that 99% of young men today have foliage too.
Love and autumn leaves in the air.
I believe their relationship is rooted in mutual respect.
They have your DNA.
"These giant broccolis are perfect. Pretend like we're mid conversation and lovingly stare in space." #couplesgoal #healthyfood #candid
Whew, it got shaky there for a moment.
Glad both sides of our brain agree: love is in the autumn air.
You need to know what the whispering grass told me about them.
I remember when they were just twigs
Remember when flannels meant lumberjacks? Now they're even sappier...
We're not lumberjacks, and they're ok.
Do you have the feeling that you are being watched?
They’re look so cute walking together, our leaves will find love in the leaf pile.
I don't mind loosing my leaves, just glad to not be a fir tree...
They're definitely sappier than we are.
And to think...I got to date you without abusing my employer/boss positioning...or did I...well, who cares.
Plaid always reminds me of our Scottish roots.
Great Hair! Why can’t we have Head&Shoulders shampoo.
Where are we? ; At the end of the trail ; But we just met.
It must be global warming - plaid season comes later every year.
We would be board if we fell for each other.
I love the fall colors on those two.
Their relationship has deep roots.
Flannel used to mean lumberjacks, but now it means love.

I tell ya Woody, it’s really good to know that those pesky Yuppies are now at the bottom of the food chain.
Sweetie - it's been four hours...
Remember? When we first met, they were just embryos.
Side effects of Denrifal may include tearing off the body parts of your loved ones and shoving them into the mouths of talking trees. C'mon, girl, don't be shy!
That's so sweet that it really makes me wish we were angiosperms.
Just once I wish he’d paint a miserable tree.
That might be 'true love' but nothing will ever be as sweet as 'tree love'...
Looks like they are about ready to plant seed and put down some roots.
The fall colors are just gorgeous this year!
Next comes a baby in a baby carriage.
Isn't that sappy?
Is it enough to share an experience with just one person or should I go back to the car now and get my cell phone?
I love "Our Hair Falls Out" season when cuddling begins.
I think his leaves fell long ago.
"Golly,Miss Maple; wish we were"t asexual.
To the day when my limb reaches yours.
Where did you post that shopping list?
When you see lumberjacks in love, you forget everything!
Yes, yes. I got the memo!
Isn't it great being a Treemoji?
We're starting to lose our leaves and he's starting to lose his hair.
You're right -- sometimes you just need to stop for a hug.
I like this walk because the forest hasn't been defaced.
Oh how cute, they both color their roots.
Seeing them makes me happy they didn't turn us into toothpicks.
No worries. Even when you're completely bald, I'll still be madly in love with you!
Oh look. best plaid plans!
What was in those brownies? These trees are freaking me out...
Aww. And they didn't even carve their initials into one of us.
She loves him - He loves her not
Oooo, look at that trunk
I think I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree.
I've seen this a hundred times. He proposed which means she uproots her life and moves into his condo in Oak Park.
The walk to Dignitas was surprisingly upbeat.
I'm just green with envy.
Trees' company!
What nice hair! How delightful not to be deciduous.
Oh! Honey, I just love the fall colors of plaid.
Look deeper in her eyes Donald, there are no smiling trees daddy always said.
Looks like Maggie has found someone else to rake our leaves.
You never take me on walks, Bob.
Cute scurrying ephemeral creatures!
Ya, You know, it was right here that I first felt the urge to become a tree-hugger..
I thought he said, "I've got-e your back!" Turns out he said, "I've daggered your back!"
That they plaid down their lives for each other gives me a woody.
So glad flannel’s back. That useless puffy-vest trend left me feeling unappreciated.
Such a beautiful couple. But what do 'clear cut' and 'strip mall' mean?
Autumn at Pleasantville Park
For once the love birds aren't on us.
We've certainly seen our share of love birds!
Your First Kiss, Under My Tree.
Their spouses are back at the Inn.
Let’s get ‘em.
Shall I compare tree to a summer’s day?
You know why this is the happy trail?
Hey Shel, isn’t that the ungrateful jerk your uncle gave his life for?
At least our death makes someone happy.
Don't you just love plaid flannel peeping season?
They don't know it yet but their call is just beginning.
it makes me pine for my youth.
That reminds me, don't forget to set your clock back one hour tonight
I hope I find someone who looks the same as me to love, too.
Our leaves match and your shoes, slacks and hair do nicely.
Ah, it molts my heart Elmer!
So romantic. It reminds me of how close we were before our roots split.
They look so in love. I hope they don't decide to carve a heart with their initials into one of us
Happiness is a walk in the park for two tree huggers.
Look, one of my leaves is stuck in his hair, I win!!!
Got any water?
I've got to tell you something....why don't you make like a tree.....and LEAF!?
I swear the trees seem happier after we started recycling.
Don't you just love the color of flannel in the fall?
Plaid sure doesn’t mean what it used to - I bet those two have never operated a chainsaw, recycle even their coffee cups, and always go paperless for their bills.
It's like the saying goes, leaves of a tree fall together.
Adorable, right? A year like this, and they're still open to an upside for "winter is coming."
Hey, don't you have a heart with their initials carved just above your roots?
Lumberjack plaid isn’t allowed in this park!
Remember when we were saplings?
Yes, I am going to leave you.
Smiles are infectious.
Oooh yeahhh! Ferns with benefits.
Eddie Bauer has nothing on us!
We should be careful about what we say. I don't know why, but I sense these trees are actually listening to us.
Two humans happy, I’m sensing a-dull-tree.
The new Amazon is a 401-k holding 100% Chinese internet.
Oh my, the lovely colors that they wear in the fall.
Checkers anyone?

All the wood loves a lover.
As the days get shorter it’s reassuring to see the lengthening of the hipsters’ beards.
Soon all will be bare
Excuse me for a minute—Mother Nature is calling.
My brother had a pet human, they keep on taking and taking...
They look like the perfect couple, if not for their checked past.
What is more timeless than plaid in the Fall? Always worthy of a good leaf shedding.
Its been 9 months and 6 days and 7 hours since you last connected with your twitter feed.
Their roots are showing.
At their age they call it a "plaid date!"
There's such a thing as being TOO close, you know.
It's almost a shame to let them know this is a haunted forest.
You know what they say, those who were flannel together stay together, for the fall.
I've got a confession to make.
They look like they are ready to go out on a limb.
Did you know trees cross paths also?
I'll give these two 3 months.
Hopefully someday our branches will meet.
We lose... They win!
Ah, remember when we were young and in love like those two lovers, that is, until you cheated on me!
My leaves can't shed the flutter of anxiety that young love brings!
I wish I looked that good in plaid!
Think of all the people this won't happen for.
Now there's a bad shirt-matched couple if I've ever seen one.
Oh, Baucis! I just hope she gets her hair permed!
Is it just me, or do you feel like we're being watched." "Don't be naive, love.
He's finally happy...
Wooden it be nice....
Next comes baby in the baby carriage.
Yes, the crisp weather helps, but I still say the best part of fall is the brilliant plaids they wear, both the males and females. We really can't compete.
Honey, I'm not upset that it is just two trees and not the whole world.
Remember when we were that young and beautiful?
And it's not just check shirts we have in common - it's our whacky habit of drawing faces on trees!
These smile-less humans just don't get it!
They’re so sweet! I’ll never “ leaf “ you either !
I heard their species doesn't understand the use of space.
don't you simply love how they suck out each other's sap? it makes the falling of the leaves so altruistic
I wonder how long it'll be until they have sprouts?
I just don't get their pre-pollination rituals.
Seems like a day to match.
They met at nursery.
Those two trees had a little too much of Root Beer.
I fall for it every time around this time of year.
Who knew that once we left the house even mother nature would be invading our privacy?
Go out on a Limb and Kiss her! We`ll Root for you!
This should be in a movie!
Is that unsightly line under his nose supposed to be a beard?
See what can happen if we branch out
He used to be a lumberjack until he met her.
That's what she plaid
I wish we were them walking along with you Gerard instead of being planted here with a fake smile saying everything is ok while we watch couples walk hand in hand loving each other.....another day another couple. I'm still dreaming.
Do you remember that I told you my folk's mom and pop business was branching out and going green?
He's such a bullshitter.
It's not as deeply rooted as our relationship, but still it's nice to see.
At least God gave us clothes this time...
Those are the ugliest trees I've ever seen.
Look. They were hit by the love leaf.
I think they're falling for each other the way our leaves are doing the same for us.
Their plaids clash.
Lumberjack shirts. Reminds me of the bad old days.
You tickle my roots every time they walk by.
Yes, it happened in a fit of rage, but there's a back story.
My back, you're asking about my back, I'll tell you about my back, She says Texting is to impersonal!
Hello, I'd like to sign up for paperless billing.
Oh, Jack, I should have never doubted your Bob Rossian vision.
Okay, this is the part of the dream when the dinosaur comes running out and eats you. So I'll see you in a few hours when we wake up. Love you......
Hey, hey, check it out. Incredibly flexible completely nude saplings!
I hope 50 years from now we could walk down this same path together to enjoy this beautiful foliage.
A rare moment for that species.
I think they'll put down roots!
How sweet, they're joined at the hip - like us.
No longer young...Yet not too old.
Keep walking. The autumn leaves come with a message about climate.
Beards are back and Fall is in the air.
Lumberjills: tonic femininity.
I can't wait to lose these green leaves. Green is so out. I'm going for plaid next year.
But Maple, with all the honey bees gone I guess it's the end of the line for them.
I'm happy to see Gerald is branching out.
I was a tree hugger before I became a real romantic.
This season is for falling in love.
How come we don't do that any more?
My roots are tickling yours.
If only we could hold limbs!
Humans are so pretty when they are in bloom!
Oh look, Treesa, two human beings actually getting along.
Of course honey but it's still nice to have their approval
Conscious coupling!

Lovely fool age.
Bob Ross's first date
First comes love...
Aah, the golden years of flannel and Cialis.
I don't think their coming back with a rake.
Even trees are condemnatory.
It won't make the news, but it gives me hope.
Leaf it to us for them to have a romantic stroll.
The path that divides or unites...sigh.
And what are the trees saying to YOU?
I love autumn--when their clothing turns to colorful plaids.
The trees smiled in anticipation of being the next Ross masterpiece
She just served papers on me.
I wish we were not so deeply rooted in this town.
It is Fall & those two are falling
Maybe Fantasia on acid was a mistake.
I wish we could do plaid.
Just keep smiling; we're almost out.
Not sure why, but when I walk here, I always think of Bob Ross

Since I can't find Contest #593, I suspect I remembered the Nov 20 (I thought) deadline wrong. If not too late for 593...... Yes, Margaret. Divorce is indeed terrible. But, please just use a subpoena next time.
Save your leaves, our job is done.
With warmer temperatures plaid is now the only signal the trees have to indicate fall has begun.
You owe me $20, Mort. Something gold can stay.

When do we see the ring?
Wanna pollinate?
You can just tell that hose two are going to have beautiful saplings with strong roots and long limbs.

Ahh, Oregon.
The Uncanny Valley is so beautiful this time of year.

I can see they celebrate the season by falling in love.
Do you suppose they have square roots?
He: ‘Do you think they are saying we should get married?’ She: ‘Maybe they are just saying they like us.’
I have a feeling that the trees are Happy to we have a feeling for each other.
She’s falling for him.
I think I have been captioned.
Sure. I’ll tell you- walks in the park, ice cream, and hallucinations.
I will see you in 10 years here between these two trees, cause people become distant over time, not trees

I hope she doesn't realize i've been wearing this shirt for a week straight...

Looks like they're barking up the right tree.
Here comes the bride, all dressed in plaid...
The "kick me" joke never gets old does it?
What do you mean you’ve “got my back?”
Take a picture and her left hand placement is could cost her her job.
I think both our family trees approve of us embarking on a life together!
Why is it everytime we hold roots, a strolling couple walks over us?
..and I'm falling for you too.
Now that we know we are politically aligned, how do you feel about leaf peepers?
I’m happy for him, but his new relationship rendered my ‘initials & heart’ tattoo obsolete.
Arecyou sure this is the way to Bob Ross' house?

Sweet, but the lumberjack shirts are worrisome.
Why did Autumn fall for that rake? I hope she leaves him!
I pat with my left too, sweetie, but I keep it all underground.
We'll wait another season and see what happens.
Plaid always takes me to my happy place.
May they have a long relationship and their plaids be the only clashing between them.

Isn’t this great, Maple? Only a week ago he was so depressed he was singing ‘I talk to the trees...but they don’t listen to me!’ And look at him now! Our little boy is finally getting lucky! I told him an Eddie Bauer shirt would do it!!
Don't leave!
It was so nice of the two of you to come back and visit your roots.

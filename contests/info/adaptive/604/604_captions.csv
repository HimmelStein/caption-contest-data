Trust me. One day your portrait will be used as the symbol of a political party even more primitive than we are.
I know what you're thinking -- don't quit hunting and gathering.
Well, if you want a record of your existence, it’s either this or the tar pits.
You should have seen my parents when I told them I didn't want to be a hunter OR a gatherer.
I'm calling it "The Elephant in the Room"
It's SUPPOSED to be primitive!
Don't worry, it's just a cave painting. No one will ever see it.
The drawing is the easy part. It's coming up with a caption that's tough.
It will be worth more when you're extinct.
How do you know it doesn't look like you?
One day you’ll be the symbol of a major political party. So, turn your head, lose all of your perspective, and don’t move one step forward.
As best as I can remember, this is what she looks like. Do you want me to arrange a date or not?
Don't worry - no one will see this in a million years.
Your nose IS big.
Laugh now, but in a few thousand years people will go nuts for this stuff.
Excuse me, you ARE the elephant in the room.
What do you mean "what is it"?
I AM making your nose look smaller.
Fire is easy. Art is hard.
Stand still...you keep on moving too far to the right.
Of course it’s a nude.
You're so vain, you probably think this wall is about you.
Don't worry. I'll make your tusks longer.
Primitive? Compared to what?
No, you will not be extinct before I am done!
OK, I'm done, you can put your clothes back on.
What do you want from me, it's the Ice Age not the Renaissance.
What did you think you looked like?
I think I'll call it 'The elephant in the room'
Oh don't be such a prima-mastadonna
Don't worry, the cave wall always adds ten pounds.
Quit complaining! You were the one who said you would model for peanuts.
Would it kill you to smile?
What do you mean it looks 'primitive?
Which one of us has an art degree from Pre-Columbia?
Well of course it looks primitive!
The lighting is perfect. Just don't stamp it out again.
You said 'passport sized', right?
What do you mean "what is it"?
It's called an emoji. It's going to be huge.
Stop being so hard on yourself. You're just big-boned.
Maybe you can work from memory but I can't.
Is this the animal you saw leaving the scene?
It’s the first painting ever—cut me some slack.
YES, almost there! You are the BIGGEST! You are the STRONGEST! You are the PROUDEST! Hold that! Love it.......L-O-V-E, LOVE IT!
Everybody's a critic. You've got four legs, a big nose, and you're fat, what am I missing here?
i know it's not realistic, I'm going through a primitive period.
I know it's a little crude, this is my first mammoth undertaking.
And this is what you'll look like after surgery.
So sometimes, when two elephants love each other very, very much . . .
You'll thank me for this when you're extinct.
Stop it. We haven’t invented perspective yet.
Remember, once you post it, you can’t take it down.
You should have gone to the bathroom before I started.
You'll look mammoth, once I draw some tiny trees.
Yes, your tail is that small.
Yes, very funny. Elephant in the room. I get it. Now can you just hold still?
OK! This angle does make you look fat!
I call it "the elephant in the room".
You want me to make you look woollier?
I promise, you won't look a day over Pleistocene.
Try to look more endangered.
Of course it's not perfect. I'm evolving; you're not.
So I told my folks, I don't want to hunt or gather, I just wanna follow my passion for whatever this thing is that I'm doing.
I know I can't draw, but I did just invent fire.
I'm more of a painter-gatherer.
Don't worry I will caption it "not actual size."
People are gonna to see this ten thousand years from now, and that's the face you wanna make?
So...does this look like the kid who sprayed you.
Good. Hold that pensive look.
I look like an animal cracker.
..No it doesn't make you look fat.
'Primitive' is exactly what I'm going for.
Calm down! It’s not like anyone is ever going to see it.
When I'm done, you can write the caption.
Your nose IS big.
Cut me some slack! I am still getting used to this opposable thumb.
I AM addressing the elephant in the room!
This is so you don't forget.
30,000 years from now you’ll be famous. Now hold still!
Stand still please ,this is for the top of the Republican memo and I want at least one thing on it to be accurate.
I asked for fierce, don’t give me pouty.
Relax, only my friends can see the pictures I post on my wall.
Quit complaining. If you wanna be famous, it's either this, or the tar pit.
Now these spear throwers I am about to add - its just a bit of artistic license and nothing for you to be concerned about.
They say the cave adds 10 pounds...
This will be mammoth!
No it does not look like an ant eater!
No, I did not make your trunk look small.
You'll thank me when you're extinct.
And the other restroom will have a lady mammoth
Why do you need a passport picture in the first place?
Well yes, it is primitive.
It’s not my fault, cave drawings always add ten pounds!
You'll thank me when you're extinct.
It'll be worth a lot more once you're extinct.
What do you mean your right side is your best side?
It's an aboriginal.
Relax, it isn't like anyone will ever see this.
Would you like the asteroid strike or the tar pit background?
How would you know what you look like?
This is no easy tusk.
Who said it was supposed to be you?
Don't worry, the cave always adds ten pounds.
What do you mean, 'two-dimensional'?
It's a little primitive, but...
All the Mastodons are having their tusks airbrushed out.
Can you look a little more vulnerable? This is for my "extinction" series.
Fiercer. More anger. You hate me. You want me dead. Good !
Derivative? How is that even possible?
How do you expect me to work in these primitive conditions?
Make up your mind - trunk up or trunk down
Except, technically you’re not an elephant, and this isn’t a room.
Okay, you can get dressed and go now. And when you leave, would you ask the guy with the spear to come in?
The hard part is to capture the feeling of 'an elephant in the room'.
How do you know it doesn't look like you?
Do you want honesty, or do you want me to take some off the rump?
Please try to duplicate the facial expression you had yesterday, Mona.
Frankly, the elevated trunk makes you look younger
This is your best side, believe me .
Yes, you’ve already mentioned your image adorns the Caves of Lascaux.
You know who else complained that it takes too long? That’s right, the dinosaurs.
Okay, okay. This time I’ll draw you chasing me.
What did you expect? I'm a Neanderthal.
I will NOT make you wooly!
Couldn't you have done that outside?
I'm calling it Plato's Republican.
Did I mention you were my first nude?
It’s my first nude too.
Don't complain. My last model worked for just peanuts.
Funding in the arts has really caved since we "made America great again."
OK, OK. I'll draw that big, too.
I'm gonna put feathers on it, just to mess with them.
You're not tiny--you're in the distance.
What do you mean, "It's derivative?"
Yes, it’s primitive, but years from now, they’ll love it
Relax, no one is ever going to see this.
I paint what I see. You want five eyes on sideways, you know where Pablo's cave is.
You might like this one. She enjoys long walks on the beach, and, of course, wants a big family.
Hold still! Remember, you’re the symbol of the party that took us all back to the Stone Age!
No, you don’t look fat in this picture.
Of course it doesn't look like you. It's an interpretation.
I'm going to paint in some people with spears so nobody knows I let you in here like this."
They pin the tusks on at the party.
If I had a longer stick we could both be in it.
Based on your ultrasound this is what you’re baby looks like today.
Contrapposto? Not in a million years.
The first elphie.
May I suggest the economy package. 8x10's for the Grandparents. 5x7's for close family and 3x5's for the herd.
So, is this your first trip to Lascaux?
You should have thought of that before you agreed to pose nude.
It doesn’t look like much now but wait 50,000 years.
Give me a break. I just learned how to make fire.
Someday, elephant in the room will have a whole new meaning.
More pouty.
What do you mean "your good side"?
This way you'll be preserved for thousands of years. But without all the tar.
How long were the assailant's tusks?
I suppose you want longer tusks?
Yes - your ass really looks that big.
Oh, great, the first critic.
Yes, you are the elephant in the room.
I'm glad you're ash gray. That's the only color I've got.
How do you feel about becoming a symbol for a group of assholes?
And here we have a rendering of what you'll look like after the tusk reduction surgery.
Trust me, no one will ever see it.
Sure, it's small but one day you'll be considered mammoth.
You don't charge. I don't charge. That's the deal.
You claimed I didn't know what I was doing when I mastered fire either.
I know it's primitive, I'm a Neanderthal.
You really think anyone's going to care in 10,000 years how big your tusks look?
Would it kill you to smile?
Oh, I’m no Picasso? Well, you’re no Babar.
Jenna, the smartest elephant in her herd, endures the first known instance of mansplaining.
I know what you are thinking. It looks cartoonish.
Whad'ya say we add an extra horn just to keep them guessing?
Okay, okay. So now we ARE addressing the elephant in the room.
Hold that pose, the light off the advancing ice sheet is just perfect!
Is there anything else that comes to mind about the perpetrator?
I know. It's not my best. At least it won't be up there forever.
This will be worth millions once you are extinct.
The little arrows? Don't worry, they're purely decorative.
Because a man gets lonely, Sheila, that’s why!
Maybe this doesn't look like you but your party doesn't look like you anymore.
Hold still and don't sneeze.
I'll never finish my masterpiece, "Under the Tusk and Sun" if you keep blocking my light!
This is the first baby picture I took of you
I'm leaving off the tusks for your own protection.
It may not look like much now, but give it 10,000 years!
Relax, this is just my rough draft. No one's going to see this.
No one thinks tusk size has any correlation to that.
I had to use ashes, spit and berries...it'll never last.
Less toothy.
No, I didn't go to art school. Did you go to elephant school?
Yes, you have to be naked.
I'm calling this the Mammoth Lisa
I’m still not sure about the pearl earring.
Your kin will be the mascots for an extinct political party in a less evolved society.
Fine, I'll leave out the guys with spears.
You won't be offended if I depict myself chasing you with a spear.
To document our elephant in the room.
Now point to where he touched you.
'I can give you hair – no one's going to know for sure.'
OK , in this scene we will be hunting you. Can you give me your scared face?
Are you sure you only want the wallet sizes?
Simple? Yes, but primitive sells.
Lighten up. One day you won't be fat, you'll be mammoth.
Smile, this one's for the ages.
Five more minutes and you can put the robe back on.
Come on, think.... We'll never get her back if you can't remember more details!
Of course it doesn't look like you! I'm an Impressionist!
All I have is gray.
Okay, now what's the caption?
Trust me, this is a better way to be frozen in time.
It's a cartoon. Say something funny and I'll write it underneath.
No, you won't be extinct before I finish!
You seem tense. Is this the first time you’ve posed nude?
But you are fat.
Someday you'll become a symbol of political corruption and everyone will want to know where it all began.
Yes, your nose is that big.
It’s very post-neanderthal
I can’t pay you but it’ll be great exposure!
You really want to make that face? This might be on the wall for some time.
Mind if I make it more dramatic and draw myself as hunting you?
Can you give me an enigmatic smile?
I said, 'Listen, Dad, there's more to life than just hunting and gathering.'
I have an exhibit opening upriver at Lascaux next month.
Yes Mr. President, your tusks will be bigger than your predecessors.
I'm telling ya, this IS your good side.
Because you ARE fat!
No I can't give you an enigmatic smile.
Yeah, extinction sucks. But cave art is forever.
In a thousand years, no one will care what you actually looked like.
It's an ELEPHANT... how could you not GET that!
I'm working as fast as I can. This is a mammoth undertaking.
Evidence that early media was biased towards Republicans
I promise. I'll make the tusks really big.
... And this is you after rhinoplasty.
How do you know you don't look exactly like this?
What do you mean, “this is taking ages”?
Of course it's 'primitive!'
Noah suggested we leave pictures of anyone not planning to meet him at the ark tomorrow.
It's the best I can do under such primative circumstances.
Yes, I do think it captures your "inner mastodon"!
No picture, no boarding. Direct orders from Noah.
Everybody wants bigger tusks!
Be patient...this is a mammoth undertaking.
Well if your memory is so great, why don't you draw her?
Yes, Thag. I'm adding the tusks, and yes, they'll be "the biggest ones anyone has ever seen." Geez, you'd think this was a presidential portrait.
We should also post your likes, dislikes, hobbies...looking to settle down, or just want to have some fun?
It does NOT make you look like a mammoth.
Try to look more Paleolithic...
Fine! I'll make it bigger!
Yes, you really look like this.
I'll have you know that I trained at Lascaux.
No you're not adopted. Look, here's a picture of you when we brought you home.
Again, could you just try to look a little more wooly and, you know, mammoth?
Goose me one more time, and I'm outta here!
Now move your legs like you're running.
Yes, your nose is that big.
You can wear the pearl earrings next time.
No, I don’t think they look too small.
This is going to be prehistoric!
I think the small tusks make you look younger.
I don't care what Adam named you; I'm calling you Babar.
Make your best "I'm about to go extinct" face.
I can have it ready in about an hour but copies will run you extra.
Tusks down, just a little and try to look coquettish.
Give me that faraway look
If you say "primitive" one more time . . .
Don't move, and don't go extinct on me.
Primitive, I know! What do you expect?
Yes it's primitive. I suppose that's to be expected.
Yes I will make your tusks look mammoth
Yes, it is supposed to look like it was painted by a caveman.
I won't charge if you don't.
Don't be silly. The cave wall always adds 10 extra pounds.
Yes I smell it, very funny.
Primitive? I call it contemporary.
Is "Ceci n'est Pas Un Mammoth" too pretentious?
Let's screw with their heads a few thousand years from now and give you a sombrero!
...and they’ll use a donkey for the Democrats!
Mammoth, Mastodon....whatever....you all look pretty much the same on a cave wall.
A little to the right, please? Oh, I see... you're about as far right as an elephant can be.
Because, not everyone has your kind of memory.
Yes, your nose does look like that.
Thanks for posing for me...and don't worry about what 'menu' means.
Okay, okay, I'll make your tusks larger
I know it’s primitive, but I’m still evolving as an artist.
I work in miniatures. I thought you knew that when you hired me.
In ten thousand years, no one will care what you looked like.
This is going to blow those hand prints out of the water.
Show me where he touched you.
Honestly, in 30,000 years who will know the difference?
Well, the wall adds 10 pounds.
Why the long face?
Okay, you can put your clothes back on.
Call me a dreamer, but one day this image will represent cutting taxes and blaming immigrants.
What...? You said I could post this!
*not drawn to scale*
I'm not a cave painter, I'm a cave artist.
Wouldn't a caption kind of ruin it?
Trust me, this will be worth a lot more when you're extinct.
I paint what I see.
No, I'm not adding "a little extra girth" to the trunk
Move again and I'll add feathers.
It's post-modern, but not yet.
No, I can't make you look thinner.
Okay, now does this look like the one who started the stampede?
hold still, this one is for the Ages
I'm sorry, but the wall adds 10 pounds.
You're not the only one who's working for peanuts.
Eh... Can you make my trunk look a little bigger?
Just relax. You won't be here much longer.
Images on the wall may appear smaller than they actually are.
I've decided it's time to address the elephant in the room.
You're my biggest commission to date.
Actually, the singular is 'graffito'
A little less long in the tooth?
When you go extinct, the price will go through the roof.
It's not supposed to look just like you. It's Art!
Whaddaya mean, you don't remember?
What do mean your nose looks big?
I'll admit that fire was a little more impressive.
I’d like to leave off the tusks just to create some buzz with the Paleoanthropologists.
The drawing is crude, sure, but just wait until you see its caption!
Adding a caption would ruin it!
Not cave painter, cave artist.
I call it, "Elephant in the Room."
Waddaya mean,'The nose is too big'?
Now I’ll never forget you, either.
You are fat. I'm not "making" you look fat!
It is a design for a cracker.
Hold still. This is for the ages!
It's hard to think of something else to draw when there's an elephant in the room.
The cave always adds ten pounds.
Is this the guy who gave you trouble this morning?
Give me that, 'I'm going extinct', pouty look.>
Would you mind if I stuck a couple of spears in you, just for dynamic effect?
I'm just saying, it's hard to focus when there's an elephant in the room.
....so the elephant said to the naked man, "How do you breathe through that thing?"
Does this look like the guy who ran off with your mate?
Prehistoric Police Sketch Artist - "Did he have any scars or tattoos that you remember?"
Goose me one more time, and I'm erasing your picture.
And I promise you, when I'm finished, everyone will be talking about the elephant in the room.
I can't pay you, but think about all the exposure you'll get.
Wall adds ten pounds.
Don't worry, this will make you look 10,000 years younger.
This painting will be one for the ages.
...Okay mammoth done. Guys with the spears ... you're up!
It's called primitive, and some day people will pay big bucks for it.
How many times do I have to explain to you tht I am not trying to ensure the success of the hunt. I am only capturing my impressions of the transitory nature of existence.
Give me softer eyes, a far-away look of longing
See? I airbrushed them out. Happy now?
Sorry, the cave wall adds 10 tons.
I cropped the nose and edited out those unsightly growths. I call it "protoshop."
Paint in color? Forget it. The New Yorker won't go there for at least another 12 million years.
I think I'll call it art.
It hasn't caught on yet, but I predict that pretty soon everyone will be talking about The Elephant in the Room.
It is not... truncated! And stop with the new words!
In this one should I have you chasing us or us hunting you?
Why, yes, you are Rubenesque.
Trust me, you’ll be famous in 35,000 years.
Now, how many wallet-size are you gonna need?
"I draw like a caveman?!
You're not fat. The paint brush adds ten pounds.
Who knows, maybe this will be worth something in 10,000 years.
Norman Rockwall.
I’m just posting on my wall, did you want me to tag you?
One more move, and someone’s gonna wish he was extinct.
Trust me, this is your best side
The good news is I've invented the fresco. The bad news is you can't take it home."
Yes, I realize a cold cave causes shrinkage.
Just wait. One day, it'll be worth a thousand words.
It's a free interpretation of your stature. Nothing is written in stone, you know.
Now, ma’am, are you certain this is the mammoth that assaulted you?
Do you want on the Ark or not?
People will talk about my 'Elephant in the Room' for epochs to come.
Yes, it's supposed to be you.
Well yes, literally I suppose my art is primitive
Hold still! This may be the only reminder that the GOP once existed and used to stand for something !
You'll thank me for this once you become extinct.
Nobody likes a critic.
So who made you an art critic?
No! Your butt does not look Mammoth.
They were called Republicans and you are the last one!
It makes you look fat because you are.
Yes, I can make your nose smaller, but it won't look like you.
I'm better with herds.
I can't pay you anything, but this is great exposure for you.
What did you expect? It's primitive art.
'Could you make me look mammoth?'
Draw you with big ears, flying? Not in a million years!
In summary, our new ad campaign with take the GOP into the Stone Age.
Listen, they asked for a mastodon, but if you can't hold a pose, I know plenty of mammoths who would kill for this gig.
Based on your description does this look like the beast that attacked you?
Primitive? I'd like to see you do any better!
You call that a smile?
This really is your best side.
I hear you. But I am a miniaturist.
Carl, I know your eyes are green but all we have is brown, beige, and darker brown
Were you able to get a look at his tusks?
Then what happened?
I'm not writing 'not to scale'.
You have a very extinct look.
To identify the suspect, I'll need more details than "un-wolly" and "non-mamothly".
The incisions would leave minimal scarring, and the resulting symmetry could accentuate your main feature.
Hold still..!! It's either this or being frozen in a glacier..!!
Now give me that enigmatic smile.
I’m hoping for my 15,000 years of fame.
What, you and the donkey can't even be in the same room together?
It's hard copy–it will last for years.
Don't move! We need to leave proof that we existed.
Trust me. You're gonna be huge.
I did not say you look pale. I said you look Paleo.
It's called a portrait. If you drew it, it would be called a self-portrait.
Listen, Babar - Celeste is my model, period. There's nothing between us.
It's abstract art. Don't take it personally.
It's your baby picture.
Hold still. I need to get this done before you go extinct.
Trust me, the clubbing, spearing, and stone throwing that I am about to draw is for artistic effect only.
What else can you tell me about him?!
Got it? Now you draw me.
You should leave, I’m going to start painting in the hunters and I don’t want to ruin the ending for you.
Now remember. The kids can only look at this for an hour while their mother and I are out.
I know it doesn't look like you but who's gonna know that in 50,000 years.
It's called contemporary art.
This is post prehistoric realism man. A protest against the materialistic trade in ivory. A crime whose time is yet to come. Also, I can’t do horns. They’re too curvy.
Of course the cave wall adds some pounds
OK. Let’s try one with the furry sweater.
If you say, "You paint like a Neanderthal" one more time...
Will you hold still? I'm trying to finish before you go extinct.
Okay, I've removed the wrinkles. Satisfied?
I don't know how to make you look sexier than this. You're already completely naked.
Don't worry, no one will ever see this!
Hold Still! I'd like to get this done before you go extinct!!
It's art. No one will think you were actually this size.
This will be worth a lot more when you're extinct.
The art world will call this huge, no, mammoth!
Unless you want to be remembered for that double chin, keep your tusks up like I told you.
Give me fierce but also extinct.
We'll try again. This time don't blink!
Do you want the dung pile in or out?
I swear if you say "Tusk, tusk" just one more time. . .
Try to show more vulnerability.
When I said you can take a bathroom break, I didn't mean RIGHT HERE!
No, the picture does not make you look fat.
I really think this one will go down in pre-history.
And this is your baby picture.
If I win this round I can go to Lascaux.
You are indeed my main source of food and clothing, but please do not underestimate your value as my muse.
C’mon, it’ll be worth a thousand words when they invent the alphabet!
Now I'm just going to add a happy little tree right here
This is one for the ages!
Give me your best "I just trampled a Neanderthal" look
Did the suspect have tusks?
Don't be such a primadonna; in 3 million years no one is going to care how fat you look.
"Are you familiar with primitivism?
Because you ARE fat!
Thousands of years from now people will pay to see this.
Can you do that mysterious but alluring half-smile for me again?
Honestly, I’m just screwing with future archeologists.
No, I would describe it as 'big-boned'.
I know you're bigger than this. I'm drawing how you look from far away.
I see your trunk has fallen. Do we need a break?
My goal is to decorate this whole cave space. It will be a mammoth project.
Well, its supposed to be primitive!
When you’re wise beyond your ears, smaller ones are better.
You're so vain, you probably think this painting's about you.
Wait, you wanted it to scale?
What do you mean you can't remember?
You are the worst at Pictionary.
Let's hurry this up, I've got the sabertooth tiger coming at dusk.
Ceci n'est pas une l'éléphant.
Yes, I’ll make your tusks look big
Ya, and you’re no Mona Lisa.
Sorry, the wall adds 10 pounds.
OK, OK, I'll make them bigger.
If you don't stop moving, we'll never be done.
Don't worry - no one's ever going to see it.
Hold still. It's hard to erase.
I promise. No men with spears.
OK, sure it's a little rough, but you forget I'm a primitive artist!
In a million years from now no one will even know it was you.
Look, this is cave painting; I don't care which art academy you went to.
I'm going through a minimalist phase.
Stop complaining. All my models are naked.
I'll tell you, this was a heck of a lot easier than that damn saber-tooth.
It's not supposed to be life-sized.
I know they're missing - just want to mess with some archeologists a few million years from now.
Can you give me a pose that says hunted to extinction?
Oh, come on, who cares if your nose is crooked? It's not like anyone's ever going to see this.
It's my mastopiece.
Don't get too pleased with yourself. I've got a donkey coming in right after you.
Don't move. We haven't invented perspective yet.
No. It's only a selfie if you draw it.
You're the perfect model. You never forget an appointment and you work for peanuts.
Don't look so petrified.
I need you to stand still! My memory is not as good as yours.
No no, you look great! The wall adds a few pounds.
Just stand still. This portrait will be one for the ages.
Sorry, but that’s what you look like !!!
Hold still. Hannibal says you have to leave in an hour.
So who went extinct and made you an art critic?
Cave drawings always add ten pounds.
Oh, so now everybody's an art critic.
Yea that's pretty much what he looked like, he was also wearing a knit cap.
Okay, you can put your robe back on now.
You have very extinct features.
A longer trunk will make you look old.
And despite what you've heard, no, I do not sleep with my models.
So she called you a wooly mammoth. My wife calls me a hairy beast.
... and stop calling me Masta' Don
There. I made it smaller. Are you happy now?
Alright already, I’ll make them bigger!
One day everyone will have an emotional support animal.
I'm not appreciated in my own time either.
Whaddaya mean I made you look fat?
Don't worry, nothing is to scale.
I might not be da Vinci, but you're no Mona Lisa.
Hold that smile.
Objects on the wall may appear smaller than they really are.
Don't be self conscious, the cave drawing adds 10 lbs.
Some of us remember things by writing them down.
My day job is a hunter-gatherer.
Yes, I think I captured your sense of ennui.
You're paying for this. Do you want tusks or not?
Yes, it’s a nude, but it’s tasteful.
I may not know who this "Rembrandt" is, but I can detect sarcasm.
Listen Ralph...the tusks are the hardest part...
Don't be alarmed, but now I'm going to bring in some guys with spears.
What's a republican?
Stop evolving and stand still!
Yes, yes, of course -- I'll make your tusks look really HUGE.
It's not SUPPOSED to be realistic. I'm a primitive painter.
What do you mean, you look bloated?
...so when a mommy elephant and a daddy elephant love each other very much...
But you ARE big boned.
Try to look more extinct.
I'm calling it "The Elephant in the Room"
Just think, your descendants will be the symbol of the Republican party.
Say something funny, we'll invent the cartoon.
It will be worth more when you're extinct.
No, it really is that big.
Okay now go get the donkey. I'm going to invent something called politics and it's going to be fucking awesome.
Give me a break I can barely see in here!
I call it an elephant, something you could never be in a million years.
Future generations will know we noticed the mastodon in the living room.
Make up your mind, trunk out or trunk down?
This is going to blow their minds - nobody's done anything but hand prints before.
First you promise not to gore me with them. Then I paint them as big as you want.
For the umpteenth time, no! This angle does *not* make your tusks look "weird."
Hold still, I need to finish this before the ice age.
Don't be shy. We're in a cave. No one will ever see this.
The wall adds 10 pounds!
Stand still, dammit!
THIS is what you mate with. Okay?
I have a feeling that people will appreciate my work only after I'm dead.
Look, I tried to tell you the wall adds 10 pounds.
Hold still, and no I don't know why it's so cold outside.
Poking me with those things isn't going to make this go any faster
You be thinking of a caption while I add the finishing touches.
What do you men"truncated'?
This is the first painting in history, the least you could do is smile.
It'll be worth more when you're dead.
Of course you're cold, it's the Ice Age.
I am not going to double your trunk size in the picture." "This is why I hate to paint elephants!
You can't see my early work because this is my early work.
I'm gonna say this one more time. It's. Not. To. Scale!
Yes, your ears really are that small.
Hurry up, would ya? I can't stand here for ages."
Why wouldn't I paint the elephant in the room?!
Just a suggestion...have you tried the new whitening strips?
Thanks for helping me draw the election district.
This IS your best side.
It's not supposed to look like you. It's modern art.
Now try to make an enigmatic, mysterious half-smile.
You said you wanted to look younger.
You're going to have to trust me. That's what you look like!
Stop complaining. I just took 2500 pounds off your figure.
Oh, yeah! Well, for your information, primitive art is very now.
Now pretend you've got a spear in your side.
OK, can you describe the hair color of the first hunter?
Don't worry, the wall adds ten pounds.
You should be happy. You’ve been selected as the symbol for the Neanderthal Party
I'm really into abstract expressionism. I just do portraits on the side.
Yes, I know what tusk size correlates to.
Okay, now give me that come-hither look.
The walls always add 10 pounds
Could you give me more of a pre-extinction expression?
Before you vanish from the face of the earth, hold still for heaven's sake.
It's called 'Instagrammoth'
It's not supposed to look "like" you, it's supposed to "be" you.
Will you stay still, you’re going to be extinct in a little while.
You think anyone's going to know it's not a good likeness in 20,000 years?
It's your baby picture.
For the last time, you don't have a good side.
You must remember other details about the assailant. Tusks? Wooly?
What the hell is a caption?
I look like an anteater
You're my first plus-size model.
No, I will not make it longer.
You paint me next, so they'll know we both were here.
You’ve had some work done, haven’t you?
Okay, let's address the elephant in the room.
In 40,000 years people will go crazy over this stuff—so will you please just stand still for another five goddamn minutes!
It is too bad that our ancestors didn't have this technology
No, I am not making your nose too big.
The brush always adds another hundred pounds.
Are you sure this is exactly how you remember it?
Its called Cro-Magnon Style. Its not supposed to be representational
C'mon, baby, show me more trunk...work with me, work with me.
Okay, now give me that "last-mammoth-on-earth" pout...
Yes, tar makes the best paint, and yes... I'm sorry about your brother.
I pay my models in cash. If you want to be drawn for peanuts, go find Charles Schultz.
Okay, okay, I'll put him on your back, but not until someone invents orange so I can get the hair right.
You moved. Now it's going to be blurry.
So what would be your opinion if I added myself throwing a few spears at you?...
No, see, you've moved again! This is going to be entirely unrealistic.
What do you mean 'it's not your good side'?
Would you stop being so critical? I've only just mastered my opposable thumbs!
I'm almost done, be patient. Millions of years from now this drawing will represent a powerful political party that will be led by a Dodo.
No, you just have big bones.
No, I can't paint is so your trunk follows people around the room.
If your family have such good memories, why do they commission portraits?
Act natural.
Don't change a thing -plus size models are in.
Now, Give me a haunted look of Extinction
Am I the only one who will acknowledge the mastodon in the room?
And, if my wife comes back, put your clothes back on
Paint adds ten pounds.
What do you mean the nose is too big?
Well, it's a lot better than your painting of me!
Look, I'm the world's first artist, so I get to decide if you need tusks or not.
To save time, I'll label it G.O.P
What do you mean you don’t want this posted on your wall?
Well, the wall does add an extra ten pounds.
Now lower your tusks like you're angry.
That IS how you nose looks!
If you don't stop moving, it will be eons before anyone sees this.
That's a mammoth misrepresentation.
Who’s the artist here?
I call it The Mammoth Lisa.
Try not to evolve while I'm painting.
If I make it any shorter you'll look like a rhinoceros.
No, I don't have any marshmallows.
Try to look woolier.
Want to add that you're looking for a relationship, not just a rut?
I don’t care how many smoke breaks the guy in Lascaux gave you!
And now we'll paint in two happy little tusks.....
Why would you want to be a Pink Elephant?
Relax, these won't be around forever.
Ok, but once this "elphie" is up, it's forever.
Okay Ed, next outfit is the Elk and we're done for the day.
"Woolly or not woolly?
I know it’s taking a long time, but I want it to last.
I just think we can't keep ignoring the elephant in the cave.
Can you think of something funny to write under this? I got nothin.
Would you be more comfortable if I was naked too?
Why, yes, the lighting is brand new. Just invented it this morning.
Like you could do better .
Break time. Can you remember your pose?
Yeah, yeah, big tusks, I got it!
How do you spell, "Wuz here"?
Beautiful. Now, show me 'fierce'.
Yes, I'm painting over it. Otherwise we'll never get our security deposit back!
Well, maybe it's not a Kehinde Wiley, but you're not exactly a Barack Obama, either.
Hold still! I can’t afford to keep throwing away caves!
Because your nose IS that big!
Did you move? Dammit! I told you not to move.
Of course you look fat. You’re a mammoth!
Here I have captured the essence of that scared little mammoth whom you hide beneath that façade of enormity and might.
The light in here is horrible. Can you stand a little closer to the fire?
Because I don't have enough paint!
Don’t move and stop evolving.
I know it's not perfect, but it's not like these cave paintings are going to last.
Could you look a little less extinct?
It _is_ your best side.
Could you make that smile a bit more enigmatic?
Trust me, they're gonna love this in about 40,000 years.
Like you could do better .
Give it to me, Baby! That's it. A little more tusk! Oh yeah! Beautiful, Baby!
No. You cannot be the one throwing the spear this time.
This was a lot harder before I invented taxidermy.
Admittedly, my skills are pretty primitive.
I know your trunk is bigger, don't worry, people won't take this literally.
Don’t worry, if it turns out bad no one will ever see it.
A nip here, a tuck there. By the time I've finished that droop will be history.
O.K., I'm no da Vinci. But you're no Mona Lisa either.
Now give me an enigmatic smile; I want this one to have staying power.
I promise you your mother will never see this. It's strictly for my private collection.
Look, I can try not to make your nose look too big, but...
I have a lousy memory so I have to write it down.
Hardy, har har...yes, I think i’ll finish before the next ice age.
For goodness' sake, speak up the next time you need to take a break …
Stop criticizing - perspective hasn’t been invented yet
I feel it makes you more approachable.
Yes, I know what long tusks mean.
I know size matters
Trust me -- this IS your good side.
It not you. Charcoal add ten pounds.
Sorry. The wall puts on 20 pounds for everybody.
Of course everyone will know it's bigger in real life.
I know, I know . . . the petroglyph adds ten pounds.
It's called perspective. It's you from far away.
Stop complaining, it's not like anyone will care what you really looked like a million years from now.
Truncating is the artist's prerogative!
You've posed nude before haven't you.
I'm doing my best- depth perception doesn't fully evolve until the Upper Paleolithic Period.
You're in my light.
Don't worry baby, no one is going to ever see these.
Just think, 10,000 years from now you'll be famous!
Trust me. The no-tusk look is slimming.
For the last time, no, I'm not going to draw you like one of my French mammoths.
Say peanuts.
No, I don’t think it makes you look fat.
Stop worrying, I'll make your tusks plenty big.
This IS your best side.
Because you'll be extinct, that's why.
That's enough for today. You can go get dressed.
Don’t you tusk tusk me.
If you don’t stop moving, this is going to be an epoch failure!
Yes, your butt really is that big.
Don't worry, no one will ever see this!
Life size portrait! Forget about it!
Because canvas hasn't been invented yet, that's why!
Let's try another one. Your eyes were closed.
Yes, I'm getting your good side.
I'm just beginning. It'll be a mammoth undertaking!
Now, throw back your trunk and give me sultry.
okay , we're finished for today , you can get dressed
You should have gone before you left home.
First time modeling in the nude?
A small nose job, a little dental work, and voilà!
I know you want me to make the trunk bigger, but the ladies will find out sooner or later!
Will you be needing wallet size prints?
Don't worry, I'll make the people extra small.
I know you're working for peanuts, but stand still!
Calm down, it's just a rough draft. And it's not like anyone's ever going to see it.
"And this is you when you were one month old".
Don't look so surprised, I told you I was a minimalist painter when you hired me!
This is what you get for paying me peanuts!
It only becomes valuable after your species dies.
Now, where’s that smile.
So, the plan is to invent agriculture, then bronze and cities, then iron and bigger cities, then the Renaissance and the Internet. But then we get Trump and it's back to square one.
Goose me one more time and you're fired!
No worries, camp fires add ten pounds.
I call it "the elephant in the room".
Now let's get one with you poked full of spears.
I am NOT ignoring the elephant in the room!
What do you mean your trunk looks small?
it's a mammoth task
Of course I will make sure your trunk and tusks are enormous.
Beautiful, baby...Now work with me...Show us those tusks....
No, I'm not giving you bigger tusks!
I want to make it clear. I never sleep with my models.
This is definitely your best side
My last cave was huge in France.
I know, I know, charcoal adds ten pounds.
Okay. I'll put the tusks on if you'll stop pooping in the cave.
Adding the tusks, won't make you look fat.
Let me remind you, again, that you are not the only elephant in this room.
Yes, the cave painting subtracts a few thousand pounds.
Because Burnt Stick is the Pantone Color of the Year again. That’s why.
But, you said make me look younger!
I prefer cave artist.
It's not supposed to look like you. I'm inventing Impressionism.
Try to look prehistoric.
I know they promised you peanuts, well guess what?... they promised me a Mammoth
Oh relax! What will it matter 6000 years from now?
Because I think horns send the wrong message.
Trust me, it will be worth more when you're extinct.
Here’s what you’ll look like after the nip/tusk surgery.
Well I’m sorry. You have a big nose. I can only paint what I see.
OK! Smile for the brush!
Stop asking. I've told you that I'll remove the wrinkles and I will.
" You startled me. I didn't see you standing there.
It's not supposed to look like you. I'm an impressionist!
Can't you keep it up for more than a minute.
Turn a little to the left please, I'd like to see more tusk.
Everything doesn’t have to be about you!
Keep in mind that the cave wall adds about 200 pounds.
It would be worth a lot more if you became extinct
Well, it's supposed to look primitive.
If I ever figure out how to get these things off the wall, I'll make a fortune.
Some day they will stand in line to see the mystery of your smile
Well I wish you hadn't tossed the pearl earring. It really made it pop.
Ok, now I need to think of a good caption.
It makes you look fat! Well you are fat!
It's an archetype- it's not supposed to look like you.
Don't worry, the cave wall always adds ten pounds.
Your skin looks amazing! Who's your pachydermatologist?
Trust me, after a few millennia everything is considered 'art'.
Hold still, I don't have your memory
Did you have to move? Now the perspective is all thrown off!
This is your good side.
I know elephants never forget, but humans do,so here it is.
This IS how you look.
Early Mansplaining
Don't worry, the wrinkles won't be noticeable.
I call this my "pre-extinction" period
Great artists are never appreciated in their time but just you wait 200,000 years.
May I suggest avoiding Asia when migrating.
Trust me. It's okay to pose in the nude.
And here’s YOU acting like a little bitch.
Never Forget
Smile, this one's for the ages.
And when a boy mastodon loves a girl mastodon very much...
Could you describe the culprit again?
Sure, I have a part-time job hunting and gathering, but my real focus is my art.
If you tank in the mid term elections I'm replacing you with the donkey
Charcoal is a slimming color, trust me.
Is this the mammoth you saw>
Let me finish posting and THEN I'll tag you
I think I have a pretty good likeness.....but only time will tell.
Trust me, you don't look Rubenesque.
Don't worry, I'll smooth out the wrinkles.
Our hunters will join you for the next pose.
Don't blame me: the cave wall puts on 10 pounds.
I’m an artist. If I wanted you to have tusks I’d give you tusks.
Unaware he was about to influence Renaissance art, Glorp said, "Now give me that subtle, mysterious smile of yours."
10,000 years from now no one will care if your trunk was tired.
I think this makes you more approachable
I'm going to add a bunch of hair and make you bigger to mess with people.
Hurry up and finish before I go extinct.
Don't worry, I can Caveshop out all your wrinkles later.
Stop worrying in a thousand years no one will remember you had hair.
What do you expect I'm a cave man not an artist
No, you're not the elephant in the room. This is a cave.
What do you mean it doesn’t look like you!
I've made your nose smaller but there's not much I can do about the wrinkles.
Hold still. I’m trying to get your good side.
I know, I know . . . it's not my fault! The cave wall adds 10 pounds!
Don't you tusk, tusk me now.
Have you ever descended a staircase?
I’m completely self taught.
I was willing to pay more, but your union said, “peanuts.”
I know, I am better at building a fire.
We call ourselves "Republicans".
What do you mean you forget what happened next?
But I AM a caveman!
Be patient! I'm trying to capture your enigmatic smile.
Because sometimes we do forget.
Yeah, well, the rest of us will forget.
I’ll fill in the details later. We’ve got all the time in the world.
If we're going to catch this guy, I really need your help in remembering the shape of his nose.
If this is accepted for the exhibition at Lascaux, I tell you, we will make history together.
Someday we may regret what you’ll come to symbolize.
Well then you must not have a good side.
It's not primitive, it's Primitivism.
There. Now tell me about you and what you are looking for in a potential mate.
It’s either Late Cave or Pre-Impressionism. Your choice.
Then everyone writes ‘like’ or ‘dont like’ right over here”
Being lef-handed is not strange compared to a mastodon who starts fires
How can I be expected to produce a masterpiece in such primitive conditions?
Relax, I promise you I'm getting your best side.
A little more tusk?
Can you give me a little bit more of that "I'm being chased by a sabre-toothed tiger" look?
I promise. No one else will ever see this.
Don’t worry about it. If Lescaux taught us anything, it’s that the cave wall adds twenty pounds.
Sorry, the wall adds five pounds.
No, I won't make them look bigger.
I'll try shopping this one out to a political party.
Sorry -- the wall adds ten pounds.
Try to remember.
After the rhinoplasty, this is what you'll look like.
Years from now they'll wonder about the elephant in the room.
What do you mean I’m making you look fat?!
Well, of course it's prmative! What did you expect?
I can't do anything about it; if I make your hips smaller, your nose will look bigger.
Can you remember any other distinctive features?
Look alive.
Oh really? And exactly what kind of lighting is "figure-flattering?"
I'm really evolving.
OK! OK! It's erect! Are you happy now?
If you don't stop moving, nobody's gonna know you even existed!
Yes, even a caveman can do it.
Sure, I can lengthen the tusks but everyone knows they're implants.
Be patient, I'm nearly done. I know it must feel like an ice age that you have been posing.
Don't laugh; in a million years I’ll be famous!
I don’t love being pigeonholed, but yes, I would classify myself as a cave artist.
Stop calling it fake art!!
More woolly...less mammoth.
It's not you! It's a picture of you!
Work with me, baby...give me a little more trunk.
An artist is never understood in his own time.
Trust me. This will be mammoth.
Don't move. I'm trying to create prehistory here.
What do you mean it looks nothing like you?
My aesthetic is mostly pre-historic post-modern.
Yes, yes... I can make the tusks longer.
Hold still - I'm losing the daylight.
Why do you only remember the times I've made a mistake?
In a million years, they won't know the difference.
Thanks for posing for peanuts.
For reasons we don't fully understand today, your image became taboo in the early 21st century.
Get over it. It's called primitive art.
I don't know, just try to be more…natural.
If I can hold my arm up, you can certainly hold your trunk up a while longer.
Well, if you must know, I’m developing a cartoon about a modern stone-age family...
I know a tiny mammoth is a oxymoron!
By the time you finish, I may be extinct.
No, I'm not making it look bigger than it is.
It's for a National Geographic pictograph essay on life in the Stone Age.
You will look better with your tusks lower and I'm going to add a more woolly look.
No. I don't want to pull your trunk.
Who went extinct and made you the expert?
Oh be quiet. Of course I know the difference between a mammoth and a mastodon.
It's going to be mammoth!
I'm doing the best I can with the limited tools that have so far been invented. And when did you become an art critic?
Thanks, Donna. We're done. Okay, hunters, I'm ready for you to pose now.
Wow! You look bigger in person.
Now it feels like a real man cave.
Ok, so I'm no good at tusks.
Please be patient, I usually draw bison.
I said I could draw a mastadon not a masterpiece!
You’ll thank me for this after you’re extinct.
Stand still, I’m losing the light!
I can't help it, your butt really is that big.
No, this light doesn't make your nose look big
All my models pose nude.
The wife didn't want to pose nude. It's her loss.
I'm sorry but this is your good side.
Art critics are such Neanderthals.
It's a bit primitive.
It’s a cave drawing, not a Picasso.
If I’d wanted action, I’d have asked the horse.
And how do you know what you look like anyway?
The retouch option includes wrinkle elimination and tusk whitening.
Lick your lips. Toss your trunk. Gimme more sexy.
Tusks down and head to the left
You do know I kill you in this story.
You just don't appreciate modern art.
You're a great model, considering your working for peanuts.
Relax, I paint all my subjects in the nude.
If you don’t hold still I will paint the bison instead and make them famous.
It's a logo for a political party. I'm trying to finish it before they go extinct.
Alright, fine. How much woolier do you want?
It's supposed to increase the property value.
I said smile.
Look, I need to get this right before we drive you to extinction.
Congratulations! The ultrasound just came in and it's a girl!
Cave art adds ten pounds.
No, I don't think it makes you look 'prehistoric'!
Now, this is how you look from far away.
Say “wooly” and tilt your tusks a bit left.
I think they'll call this my paleo-photorealism period.
I told you the wall adds 10 pounds
Just hold still, in 10,000 years somebody will think this is important.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe I make you look fat because you ARE fat?
How would you know, have you ever looked at yourself in a mirror?
Hold still or I won’t be able to finish before the Homo sapiens arrive.
Stop moving. Pretend you are frozen in time.
Okay, okay! I won't put the spears in the drawing until after you leave!
I know, congratulations, they're HUGE. But I'm still doing it my way.
Hold that pose. One day this picture is gonna make both of us famous!
I've told you a hundred times to keep still - why can't you remember?
Hurry up with those spears, I'm almost finished making the menu.
I call this the "The Elephant in the Cave."
It's Maslov's higherarchy of needs: first food, then fire, then self-reflection.
I’m beginning to think that choosing you as my muse was a mammoth mistake
And now for a pair of happy little tusks.
I’m calling it “there’s an elephant in the room”
I think this will be one for the ages.
Until they invent mirrors this will have to do.
What do you mean 'my style is too primitive'?
Can you arch your trunk a little so it's like you're smiling but also you're not smiling?
Can we have just the hint of a smile, please?
I don’t have a mistress to paint, that’s why.
The ladies on Cave Tinder like a perky trunk.
Before the elephant in the room, there was the elephant on the wall.
10,000 years from now do you really think anyone will be able to tell the difference between a Mammoth and a Mastodon?
Oh yeah? Well, 35,000 years from now you'll be dead and I'll be the toast of the town.
Your butt IS fat!
I know I know your trunk is bigger than that.
Okay, before I add me spearing you, try to look a lot fiercer.
You're a natural. Most of my subjects won't even think of posing nude.
This, not me, is your ideal mate. Got it?
What do you mean I have to put things in perspective? It's not invented yet!
Yes, I know it's not life-size, but they'll get the idea.
Yeah, yeah, big tusks.
Shut up! I'm a minimalist.
This will make you immortal, and the subject of hundreds of doctoral dissertations.
Get happy. All my models work for peanuts.
Don’t glare at me! It’s the nose Mother Nature gave you!
Its time someone acknowledged the elephant in the room
Maybe you have a good memory, but I need to write it down!
Trust me. You’re gonna be mammoth.
No, of course not. The cave adds 10 pounds.
Why's everything gotta be political with you?
But drawing you to scale would be a mammoth undertaking.
Size doesn’t matter
But you must realize that the cave wall adds tens pounds.
Opposable thumbs, smarty pants!
I can't pay you for posing, but years from now you'll be famous.
This shall be my cromag-num opus.
I know it's small. It's a representation. It will evoke an emotion in the viewer. It's art, for crying out loud.
Trust me, cave-ies are all the rage right now.
Yeah, well, you'll look a lot worse when they dig you up 40,000 years from now.
Your free offer includes only a wall-sized picture.
Yes, you will be extinct but try to smile
Smile...someday your image will be the symbol of an extinct political party
I don't know what you mean your "good side." I can only paint one side.
Is this the man you saw?
I'm evolving.
I've told you a hundred times, I don't care if my painting doesn't capture the real you. It's not as if anyone else is ever going to see it.
A smile will not make you go extinct.
Let me Cave-Mansplain something to you real quick.
When I invent perspective, people will see how big you were.
And that's how you become irrelephant
Pretend to run.
How about more pensive? Consider your own extinction.
What do you mean, it doesn’t look a thing like you??
Say peanuts.
I am going to call it the elephant in the room.
What do you mean I’m making you look fat?!
Patience please. This is, after all, a mammoth undertaking.
I don't do realism.
I'm going to call it " Make the Stone Age Great Again".
Stand still, so I can draw where the spear will pierce you.
Ok, let's take a break. But, remember that pose.
You You’ll get your peanuts when I’ve finished.
This drawing of you inspire an entire political movement!
Trunk UP! How can you keep forgetting?
In the future, this will be considered a mammoth achievement.
First man to notice the elephant in the room.
Trust me -- this IS your good side.
Okay, I'M finished now. You can get dressed
How many times do I have to tell you?!? Hold still and stop worrying about it - those rumours about the ice melting are a complete hoax.
This is a mammoth undertaking.
Relax, I know you're not that fat ... perspective hasn't been invented yet.
It's called 'artistic license', okay?
I don't like it either, but 10,000 years from now they'll be lining out the door to see it.
We can CavePaintshop out the wrinkles later.
I’m sorry, you only have to hold this position a little longer. My buddies just are not going to believe me unless I post a picture of you on my wall.
'lookin' good...now let's see those ivories.'
Yes, I know it's called rhinoplasty, but, trust me, you're a perfect candidate.
Using burnt sticks and working with this miserable lighting, of course it's a bit primitive !
Now will you stop bothering me for a baby picture?
And did he have any facial hair? Tattoos?
Let's talk about the elephant in the room.
Gimme a break...do I tell you how to stampede?
It's oil based and should last about 5 million years.
More tusk. It needs more tusk.
I mean, sure, it’s no Lascaux... but we all have to start somewhere, right?
Good. Now a little ambiguous smile.
'Thanks for agreeing to the naked thing."
Just because you are a Republican doesn't mean you can't give me a little smile.
...and what was your husband wearing when you last saw him.
What do you mean the trunk is too small?
It’s cave art ,not a portrait!
Just in case you go extinct
Of course I won't show anyone else. The pictures are only for me.
Frustrating, I figured out fire but I just can't get the tusks right.
Yeah, well you're no mastodon
I'm sorry, but the wall adds 10 pounds.
I hate to break it to you, Doug, but there's no angle that would make you look "svelte" - as if that's even a healthy body image for someone with your bone structure.
Well in ten thousand years people might like it!
If you move one more time, I'll switch to abstract.
I know, I am not Leonardo, but you are not Mona Lisa either.
The original elephant in the room!
Trust me, nobody will care about those tusks.
No, I won't paint your tusks larger.
Believe me, it's your good side.
Yes, it is cast in stone.
I told you no more paintings or else we're gonna lose our security deposit.
Yeah, well, Mr. Art Critic, maybe you should evolve some fingers and see if you can do better.
Never discuss the elephant in the room, but my therapist say drawing OK.
This is how you will look after we monetize those tusks.
The perp's tusks--were they about this long?
I progressed to minimalism, as I strongly feel it is the most relevant visual language for our day and age
"The last time I posted on my wall, i got seventy-five ughs".
And after you do that, in about 18 months to two years, a little baby mammoth is born...
Hey Babar, what’s the glyph for “remember”?
Hold still, this will be worth millions when you’re extinct.
Relax, I'm just getting to the tusks!
See, you're not the the elephant in the room anymore; He is Ok?
Oh, I didn't see you there...
I know this is awkward. I don't usually do nudes.
Don't worry. Cave walls always make you look 10% fatter.
Now, how about a little, enigmatic smile.
How long has your wife been missing?
Make up your mind already. You going to swipe left or right?
Can't you stand still ?
Now make up your mind. Trunk up or trunk down? Tusks or no tusk? Wooly or not wooly?
Global Warming is just an hoax! This painting on ice will last forever..
Life sized? No, if you'll remember, what I said was life LIKE!
Can't you hold it till I'm finished?
Don't worry we will find him - I'm posting his picture on my wall.
As you requested, I'm taking a few inches off your nose.
When we started you were just a Mastodon.
And this is how you will look after the tusk removal surgery.....
OK. Fine. I’ll make the tusks bigger and the butt smaller.
Enough with the enigmatic smile.
Ok, I'm ready for the hunters with the spears.
Yes it's nude, but it's tasteful.
Yes, the firelight is on your good side.
I want to remember you after you're gone.
I’ll Protoshop out the wrinkles later.
I need to start over. You blinked.
To make the drawing larger would be a mammoth waste of time.
Oh stop it. I'm not making you look fat.
Just wait until mirrors are invented. Then you'll see that, yes, your ears really are that big.
Hold still, this is for pre-history.
This could take forever. Think I'll just find some mastodon-pattern wallpaper.
I am sorry, but yes, I am not exaggerating; your nose really is that big.
You'll be famous. Whose going to remember me?
Hold still. I'm entering this for a GOP logo design competition!
Stop it with the trunk when I'm not looking!
I suppose you think you could do better.
Try to look less frigid.
This will be worth a lot more when you're extinct.
Your motivation? Try Survival of the fittest.
Wait, before you trample me, let me post this to my wall.
Okay, I uploaded your picture to my Facebook wall.
See, you look fine without them. The ivory trade will be good for both of us...
It's nude for beauty, not objectification.
I'm not making you look fat. You ARE fat.
Seriously, you're even afraid of a drawing of a mouse?
Don't worry, I can airbrush the wrinkles out.
Give me coy.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
Yes, it's a nude and no, I don't think your mother will "die of embarrassment".
Unless you pay scale, you won't be drawn to scale.
Don't worry, I'll airbrush out the wrinkles.
Stay still! I am trying to record history!
I’m not making you look fat. You’re a mammoth.
Okay, okay, I'll add your great tusks and and your big hairy shoulders but I get to be the Great Hunter with Spear.
Its called scale.
Sorry, the cave wall ads 10 pounds
By the time you're done drawing, I'll be extinct!
I told you, size does not matter!
Don’t worry. I’ll give you the biggest tusks.
What do you mean that's not your best side?
Quit that right now - the cleaning service doesn't come for another week!
It going to be a cookbook.
Yeah? Well, you're no Mona Lisa.
I'm experimenting with a more Mesolithic style
Trust me Linda, this is your good side.
At the moment, this is our only suspect.
Sure I hunted you, but can't you separate art from artist?
Thanks for answering the ad. I knew models are willing to work for peanuts.
if you don't hold still you'll look like a bison
Just you wait - a true artist is never appreciated in his time.
I know this is difficult but did you happen to see the color of his eyes?
I own the original and full copyrights on any prints or reproductions. Did you even read the model release before you signed it?
Yes, I'm sure you will soon be history.
If you don't like it, just say so. Quit ignoring the you in the room.
Give me a break, I just invented fire.
This is a mammoth task.
OK I'm done - you can get dressed.
Everybody is a critic!
Look, when you took the gig you knew it was for a nude study.
Quit blinking!
You may go extinct, but through my art you'll live forever.
That's it baby. Keep that look. You look amazing in this light.
You are big! It's the picture that got small.
C'mon. Three syllables.
What do you mean you look like Babar?
Yes!, yes!, give me that sexy look again.
Really? Well, I remember it differently...
You can unfreeze now.
Just think, after this you won’t be working for peanuts anymore....
Relax, the wall adds ten pounds.
My god, the late afternoon sun softly highlights your ineffable confidence and unrivaled ability to lean into a pose.
Making you look mammoth? Seriously?
Stop laughing - one day "Caveman" cartoon contests will be all the rage.
Excuse me, but rendering you full size is too mammoth a tusk....er task.
Hold it...hold it...good. Now show me 'stampede chic.'
One day, we'll be discovered.
Well good for you, me I gotta write it down.
Never mind the mouse, stand still!
Well, it wouldn't look 'stylized' if you'd just hold still!
If you want a life-mate from your profile could you at least try to smile?
Ok, for this next scene, pretend I hunted you for dinner.
Ceci n'est pas une pipe.
Please stand still, we both don't have much time!
Well, I suppose I should address the elephant in the room.
Close your left eye and tell me what you see.
Maybe it doesn't look like much now, but give it 35,000 years
Yes. I did shorten the tusks a little, but I think it gives you a more youthful appearance.
I hope you understand that modern art shies away from literal representation.
Yes, I know. Another prehistoric cartoon in The New Yorker. But it pays the rent on the cave.
Okay, I'm finished, but don't go anywhere. I'm throwin' a big barbecue later tonight, and I can't do that without you, either.
Draw me like one of your french elephants.
Smile. Don't think of Trump.
I just hope someone draws my picture before I go extinct.
This would go a lot faster if you'd just smile.
Wait till you see what I do with the tusks--you're going to love it!
Trust me, in 20,000 years you'll be famous.
I'm going to call it my pleistocene period.
Laugh now, someday this place will be Soho.
I didn't say it was a mammoth painting. I said it was a painting of a mammoth.
Any particular reason why you want me to omit your to-die-for tusks?
My trunk just looks small now because it’s cold out.
Don't forget the tusks.. they're my best feature!
It’s a primitive sketch.
Then what?
In the twenty-first century A.D., a people called Americans will hope the party you represent will become extinct.
For the last time, this picture does not make you look fat!
Don't be so hard on yourself-- you seem very evolved to me.
No, that's not her. The cow that stole my fig tree had beady little eyes and a real attitude in her walk.
It is primitive art after all.
If you'd BROUGHT your plastic circus ball, I would have DRAWN your plastic circus ball!
I understand its not accurate Henry but between the two of us I'm the only one with opposable thumbs.
Stand still or I'll never get this done before the Ice Age.
You can get dressed now.
Yes, even a cave man can do this.
And it doesn’t smell like you either!
Show me some anger... Like you were about to be hunted to extinction.
Until I started to draw you, I never noticed the color of your eyes before!
It’s nobody you know.
For the thousandth time, stop posing and just try to look natural!
I'm calling it "artistic license".
Is this what the suspect looked like?
If you're looking for tusk exaggeration or ash brushing, you're in the wrong cave.
Now give me that enigmatic smile.
I'd rather look more like a Democrat.
Now give me a pout.
Trust me, you'll be famous some day.
This is going to be a classic.
Relax. I can photoshop it.
I'm gonna add a bowler hat, just for kicks.
Yes, this is what you look like and no, it is not to scale.
Can't you see I'm trying to capture your playful side?!
Try to look slightly amused.
Don't worry, it's not permanent or anything.
No the wall doesn’t add 10 pounds!
Anyway, they told me my technique was barbaric, so I dropped out of art school and pursued my own interpretation of post-Neanderthal realism
They say "the cave wall adds ten pounds."
Jerry, this IS your good side.
I'm not so good at tusks.
This is for posterity, just in case you go extinct.
It's the first cel of an animated feature, so this might take a while
Babe, I told you this is just for us. Besides, the way my career is going no one will ever care about my art.
It may not seem like it now, but we're making history here.
Just a few more minutes - extinction can wait.
You aren’t fat. Charcoal adds 200 pounds.
If you want this to show you winning a battle with a tiger you're going to have to figure out how to get one to pose.
I know you're naked....but it's ART!
Good. Keep your trunk down and tusks up.
What do you mean "Draw me like one of your French mammoths?"
And just how would you like me to show your “incredible memory”?
One word. Three syllables.
I'm using long lasting paint, so we should be good for awhile.
No, it is not an armadillo.
And you think you can do better ?
A smile, please. A little sort-of mysterious half smile.
I promise no one will think you were truncated.
I said I could make you look smaller,not thinner.
I got your good side.
I don't know what cheese is either. Just trumpet something and hold it for a minute or two.
You'll look like a woolly mammoth when I'm finished
Paint me like one of your French mammoths.
Is it OK if I post this?
Keep still, I have to finish before you go extinct.
Well, you are somewhat stout.
You try to capture 'inherent majestic grace' using a stick and some colored mud.
Give me that mysterious smile.
Theoretically, nothing is set in stone.
Oh be quiet, I've got to start somewhere.
I don't do portraits. I'm a cave man -- only side views. Now will you please turn!
Why must you always dwell on the size of your tusks.
Hold still. I’m loving the firelight reflected in your eyes.
No, I’m not gonna make it bigger.
Well if you must always be in the room, let's get your portrait done.
Give me 'SAVAGE'!
Ask the antelope. Ask the sabertooth. The charcoal always adds ten pounds.
I promise, no-one will see it.
It's more of an abstract.
Uh, your butt actually IS that big.
I'll soon be a Master, Don!
Keep your trunk on. I'll get to the tusks.
For the last time - life-size costs extra - a LOT extra!
If I'm a lousy artist, you're a worse elephant.
Next, we need a creative caption.
It's not you, specifically, more the essence of you in a post-modern reality. But, yes, I could make the tusks bigger.
No, I won't airbrush out your wrinkles.
Hold still. It's a difficult tusk.
It's not meant to be literal.
It just looks that way, the cave wall adds ten pounds.
Draw me like one of your French caves.
No Erick, it won't make it to the New Yorker, they haven't started publishing yet.
I know you said you'd pose for peanuts, but I don't know what they are.
Which side IS your good side?
Yes, this is your good side!
In 20,000 years you will be famous
How'd you start that fire?
I'm trying to capture a fresh perspective, whatever that means.
It’s a matter of perspective, okay?
It's called creative license, and I say it looks like you.
I just have to think of something funny to write underneath it
Well, perhaps their subject matter was a little more cooperative in Lascaux!
The ad said 'Draw the mammoth. Win an art scholarship'.
Now remember, the limestone adds ten pounds.
This is just a rough sketch.
You might not believe this, but I actually started out as a gatherer.
Less pensive, and more awe struck.
Shall we do the kitchen in wildebeest?
OK, you are here.....
Did the assailant have tusks?
You had to sneeze at exactly that moment.
Give me more pout.
My early work was more abstract, but I feel like I am gravitating towards representational pieces these days.
Don't look at me, the cave wall adds a 200 pounds.
No! I won't make your tusks bigger.
What do you mean, "now draw yourself under my left front foot?"
Ok, fine, let’s talk about the elephant in the room.
I'm not used to working with paint, my usual medium is blood.
What do you mean, not wooly enough? This is how you look!
Stand still, this will be pre-historic one day!
In case your memory fails...
Yes, you are the elephant in the room.
This is you when you were a baby!
I told you, painting first, peanuts second.
Stop moving...I told you, the fire is just an illusion...we haven't discovered it yet.
Ok, now raise your trunk and give me a pout.
Scoff all you want now, cuz in a thousand years I'll be famous & where will you be? Extinct!
You're gonna like the way you look, I guarantee it.
This is a mammoth task.
If you turn your head a bit, you can catch the firelight on that right tusk.
You want the trunk bigger?
I call it 'Tiny Elephant'
You should talk? I've seen your paintings.
This is you in 10,000 years.
I prefer to call it "Naive Art". "Primitive" is so uncool.
Does this look like the perp who tried to steal your ivory?
Yes! But is it ART?
You just don't get primitivism.
A pearl earring? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of!
What do you think? It's my first trunk show.
Okay, now you draw me.
I'm tired of standing here. Why can't you just do it from memory?
It begins with an 'E' and has 3 syllables.
Yes I noticed you have grown since I started.
Can you show me "Paleolithic"?
Once I'm done, I'll post it on your wall.
I'm trying to move away from Neo-Paleolithic Impressionism.
Just a few more minutes....It's all mastodon.
I’m the artist, and you do have stubby legs.
For the last time, this IS your good side!
My big concern is that the place's new owners will paint over it.
The saber-tooth got time-and-a-half because it had an agent. Also, teeth.
Hold still will you, this is going into National Geo's prehistoric issue
The wall always adds a thousand pounds.
Now we'll just add some happy little clouds.
Evolution, mevolution. And I suppose you believe in climate change.
I did not make you look woolly.
JUST THINK. THOUSANDS OF YEARS FROM NOW, THIS WILL BE THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT YOU EVER EXISTED.
How do you spell that?
We'll have our first retrospective in about 10, 000 years.
Did your attacker have any tattoos?
You said smaller. If you wanted slimmer, you should have asked for slimmer.
Stay still. I want to preserve you.
Whaddya mean I would be better off hiring an interior decorator?
I'll note that images on the wall may appear smaller than they are.
C'mon...Angry! Give me Angry!
No, I don’t think it makes you look fat.
Look, you want Thomas Kinkaid, you hire someone else to do your portrait.
The cave wall adds ten pounds.
Oh don't exaggerate, your tusks aren't that big
C'mon Mona, where's that smile?
Don't give me that look, it looks just like you!
have you considered a nose job?
The wall adds 10 pounds. Honest!
No, this drawing does not make you look fat.
Let’s see a little more tusk!
Wow... The cave drawing really does add 10 pounds.
Try to show a little more leg.
Look, I paint what I see. You just aren’t as thin as you think you are.
Okay...where did those things come from?
Don’t worry, I’m sure no one will ever see this.
How can you be an art critic? This is the first work of art!
Why does Bob Ross make this look easy?
You say, he mounted you from behind - did you notice any distinguishing characteristics?
Do I really have to pose naked?
But you are fat.
Just wait, you'll be famous in 3600 years.
Are you kidding? It looks just like you!
This painting will make you so famous that someday you will symbolize lower taxes, and an oil rig in your own back yard.
At least TRY to look presidential!
It's post-prehistoric style, okay?
This is your baby picture
We’re done. You can get dressed now.
hold still not everyone has your memory
Relax! They won't know that I didn't hunt you down!
No, I'm not showing the tusks - people will kill for them.
Again, how long has he been missing? Are you sure he isn't just extinct?
Trouble is, people never truly appreciate art till we’re dead.
Funny thing, my next customer after you is a donkey!
I'm doing a whole series. I call it Neanderthal Geographic.
They won’t know you were in the room.
I'm going to leave the tusks off because it will make you look less extinct.
Turn a little bit more to the left, please.
How long is this going to take? I’ll be extinct soon!
“Trust me, this will make you famous”.
Of course, what I'd really like to do is direct.
Don't be so vain. Nobody's going to see this.
Don't worry, the drawing adds 10 pounds!
Now paint me like one of your Paleolithic girls.
You're far away -- do I have to explain the rules of perspective to you again?
What do you mean “you forgot”?
If you want it bigger, make sure an elephant never forgets his checkbook next time.
Say tundra grass
It does NOT make your ass look fat.
That’s enough fooling around. Let’s focus on the tusk at hand.
I don't care if your tusks ARE toasty, could you please stand still?
This technique could have prehistoric significance one day.
Thank you for standing still for three months. The unicorn drove me crazy.
I can make you look smaller, but not thinner.
No, I said you're looking "tusky"!
No, this does not make you look fat
This is not you. It's the Platonic ideal of you.
Fancy staying over for dinner?
‘I’m going to call it Elephant’.
Don't worry--nobody's going to see this.
This is only a sketch. The final version will be life-size.
This better not end up on the web.
Yes. I will get your horns in the drawing.
Keep your trunk up or I'm going with the donkey!
Just a little more to the left, Paul.
The charcoal add ten pounds.
Anyways, the cave wall adds ten pounds. Everyone knows that.
Quit moving your trunk!
I get it. You're a mammoth, but I've only got so much paint.
Hold still. Have to get this right before you become extinct.
Can you give me that iconic mammoth smile?
I guess I'd call it Post-Neanderthal Realism.
Gladys, I think it's time we address the elephant in the cave.
Before you get upset, remember that the wall adds 10 pounds.
And after the surgery your nose will look loke this.
It's not meant to look exactly like you. I'm experimenting with Pre-Impresssionism.
I'm all out of ivory white.
Okay now play dead so I can draw the next scene
No one will see this five years from now. Why are you so worried about a few extra pounds?
No, I don't think it makes your butt look big.
There; now no one say Torg 'ignore elephant in room' again!
I know your trunk isn't sticking straight out, it's called artistic license.
Now turn sideways while Gorg pretends to throw a spear at you.
Here we go again with the "Make my tusks HUGER...."
it’s called prehistoric minimalism
"I'd ask you to say, "cheese" but it is not invented yet.
Don’t worry. This is a first draft.
No, I can't just 'knock a few pounds off'.
Just going extinct is no reason not to at least smile for me.
Trust me, this is your best side
Ars longa, vita brevis.
Well which side IS your good side?
It's not surrealist, you're just that fat.
No one'll believe I got an elephant to pose for me.
Well, someone has to acknowledge the elephant in the room!
I know, I know...you're mammoth.
When first starting a diet, it’s best to visualize a future slimmer you.
No, I will NOT make them larger!
I guess I'd have to say my artistic style is still evolving.
...and if you REMEMBER our agreement, and I know you do...the trunk needs to be EXTENDED....EXTENNNDED.
Yes, posing naked is part of the job.
My agent says do to this until there’s a market for abstract impressionism.
C'mon, work with me! Let me see that personality!
I know it's not a faithful representation, but the trunk looks better this way.
Nudes are my specialty.
Can you make my trunk look bigger?
If you want to switch parties, fine! But in this cave we still vote Neo-Pachyderm.
Martha, your ass looks fine!
I can't seem to get the smile right.
Let's review: You need one portrait for your passport, and you desire a second one for your mother?
What say we knock off for the day and hit the ol' watering hole?
The cave adds 20 pounds.
Thank you letting me post this on my wall! My followers love elephants.
I told you before that passport paintings take at least an hour.
Hold still .... I want to finish before you go extinct.
Now for the tusks. On a scale from 0 to Trump, how self-aggrandizing would you like?
If you mention the size of the tusks again, I'm going to turn it into a labradoodle.
You can forget about that that modeling fee. We're both working for peanuts.
What's the rush? It's not like you're going extinct.
Yes, you have to be naked.
This is just a rough sketch with primitives.
Give me a break, this isn't Lascaux.
Give me more of that pouty look.
If you aren't happy posing for me, you can always run away to the circus!
One day you’ll be famous as the first elephant in the room.
We're losing light. Think you can survive for one last session?
When the donkey arrives I'd like to do a political cartoon.
Don't worry. The wrinkles come out in post-production.
Could you just stop evolving until I finish this?
Of course it's derivative.
You'll be safer if I don't draw in the tusks.
Have you been a nude model for a long time?
As you leave, could you please ask the saber-toothed tiger to come in.
You're not the only one getting tired of the caveman cartoons!
Does this make your tusks look too big?
You moved your trunk again!
I’ll do my best, but the wall adds five pounds.
Just hold still and I'll finish before you're extinct.
I know you could work from memory, but I need you to stay put.
I haven't discovered perspective yet.
You think art is pointless? I promise you this will be here long after we are.
I know I didn't draw them in. They look fake on you. Are they implants?
Give me a little more profile.
I'm just saying, without a better profile pic, you'll never find a mate. Then, where will you be?
Is that how you want to be remembered?
Hold still or you're going to look like an elephant!
Okay, we've got a big nose, big enamels, now how about a big smile!
I'll draw full-size once you invent the ladder.
Ok, I may not be a Leonardo, but you certainly are no Mona Lisa!
Yeah, I know, but you ARE fat.
Did you notice how short I made your legs? I call it the "Corgi Mammoth".
Yes, it is too that big!
Any other notable details? I'll send this image down to the station and we'll see if any matches come up.
Let me just finish this portrait of you, and then you can go play in the tar.
I'M NOT DRAWING THIS TO SCALE - OK?
Calm down. I'm starting with your grandmother on your father's side who had no tusks!
Okay, okay. I'll make your tusks look longer.
No, I will NOT make your nose look smaller. I'm a realist.
Remember, the cave wall adds 10 lbs.
Ugh, the lighting in here is prehistoric.
For the last time, stand still and quit going extinct!
It's not really a selfie if I do all the drawing.
The agency told you you'd be posing in the nude, right?
What I can do for you is a procedure called a tuskectomy. It’s very common for mammoths looking for a more youthful appearance.
I know. It doesn't look like you. I call it Impressionism.
Next we’ll do one with you in wool.
The fire stays. It puts you in the best light.
How long do I have you for?
Stop moving or it’ll take me a million years to finish!
Yes, I know you're not this small.
No, I'm not making your trunk too small. What are you, a Trump elephant?
That mysterious smile will get us nowhere.
No, tusks are an element of patriarchal dominance.
Yes, but could you make just a little effort to smile?
You might never forget, but I need a picture.
Yes, you did move.
Does mammoth have two ems or three?
Well, you don't exactly look like the Mona Lisa, either.
You're so vain, you probably think this is about you.
Realism is so last epoch.
I am leaving the tusks out because they make you look bestial.
Great! Alright. Now give me some pouty lips.
I know it is primitive but someday cartoons will be all the rage
In a few thousand years you might become a Republican.
Hey! I said don’t look yet!
Do you think you could draw it better?
No, I am clearly -not- ignoring the elephant in the room. See? It's right there.
Look like you forgot something.
I'm just making an artistic statement, okay? The tusks are a little too much.
Keep that friendly, but fierce look
You just wiggled your ears again! How do you expect me to immortalize you if you cannot even stand still.
They say that the stone adds 1000 pounds.
It's art.
What "good side"?
No, I won't exaggerate the size of your trunk and tusks.
We'll have to speed this up, I have other models coming in.
Look, if you'd try Paleo, perhaps your butt wouldn't be mammoth
You're beautiful, work with me.
The first critic!
Welcome to the GOP Convention 2019
I'll debut this at my trunk show.
Don't expect my best work; you're paying me peanuts.
just sayin, you're a bit long in the tusk
Now give me that Mysterious Smile.
You don't look mammoth.
I can post whatever pictures I want to on my wall.
Of course it’s you!
Don't be silly - it's not pornographic if you don't wear clothes in the first place!
No, I haven't. Who's Fleetwood Mac?
Now, give me that Mona Lisa smile
The charcoal always adds ten pounds.
Alright already - I gave you a smaller nose.
And thus ends our sex-ed class!
I'm sorry, but you just don't have a good side.
Stop complaining. I paint the way I see it.
Plato's gonna get a kick out of this.
Keep your trunk still if you want to finish this before the end of the ice age
Well, I don’t see YOU picking up a paint brush!
No, I will not make you look slimmer.
Entry in the Mammoth prize competition: "The Elephant in the Room"
Yes, I'll make the tusks bigger.
I know, I know, the cave adds ten pounds.
Sneeze one more time and this session is over.
But your tusks are what make you you...
Nobody will believe those tusks, trust me.
Well, what do you expect!? I'm a friggin' caveman!
If you move I cannot give you 2 tusks.
No, I will not lengthen your tusks.
I'm sorry it's so two-dimensional, but perspective hasn't been invented yet.
I know the tusks aren't to scale - it's for the National Portrait Gallery, not the White House.
Okay, Say cheese.
Quit whining, the Republicans will never pick you anyway.
I tell you, that Paleo diet really has done wonders for your jowl line.
You're part in the play will be to pretend to play dead when we put spears here, here, and here.
You'll forgive me if I miss a few details—the lighting in here is terrible.
Is there any other feature you remember of who stole your peanuts?
Pleistocene sales are weak but the critics are predicting a hot Holocene.
No, I can’t give you a Mona Lisa smile.
So it's not enough to pose for me, you gotta be a critic, too?
I usually do at least five of these before I have one I feel good about.
In this age, you either publish or perish
I’m happy to take off a few inches but I need you to smile.
You're right! You do look better with a nose job.
Do we need to start with the birds and the bees or can we just cut to elephant boys and girls?
So... am I hunting you or you're trampling me?
I always have trouble painting the nude figure.
Fuck off, I'd like to see you do better.
Thanks for filling in. The saber-toothed cat fell into a tar pit.
Trunk up, damn it! Trunk up!
You can rest in a minute, just stop evolving!
Do you think it looks like Babar?
The cave paint always adds ten pounds.
No, I don't think it makes your butt look big.
You are not fat. You are Rubenesque.
This just the IDEA of an elephant.
No, I just do the drawing. You have to come up with the caption.
Because you are always nude.
Cave walls really aren't my preferred medium.
No, no, no, My tusks are HUGE, HUGE!
Are you sensitive about how I do your tusks?
No, your butt does NOT look too big.
Wildlife and hunters -- that's all people want in their caves these days!
I happen to like 'white elephant art.'
I'm sorry if I seem a little frightened -- I've never drawn a nude before.
Well, your nose IS big.
Just think, in 40,000 years you'll be famous
Please -a little "Mona Lisa" smile won't hurt.
I call it 'Portrait of the Elephant in the Room'. You got a problem with that?
Wall add 10 pounds
Because, believe it or not, a day will come when you WILL forget.
Paint me like one of your Lascaux girls.
Hold still. I don't want you to be extinct before I finish this.
Or course you don't look fat
I might not have enough paint for the tusks. How do you feel about being remembered as vaguely anteater-like
You seem to be having trouble with Pictionary. How about charades?
No! It does not make you look heavy.
It's called scale, alright! Don't be so sensitive, my wall is only so big!
What do you mean that's not how you remember it?
For an upcharge, I can add more wool around your face, lengthen your tusks, and fill out your backside.
This is the last time I help you with a personal ad.
I know, they're HUGE...just give me a minute.
They say a picture is worth a 1000 herds.
join now during our in cave special and I’ll have you looking like this in 6 months.
Do you want to be remembered 3,000 years from now as the elephant with the droopy trunk?
No, I don't think this color makes you look flat!
For the last time, no I do not have any peanuts.
No one is going to believe me if you don't hold still!
Great look! Now hold that expression.
You’ll need this to board the plane . . .
Caricature is the future!
I think this mural captures the zeitgeist of the stone age.
You bring more firewood and I'll carve you bigger tusks.
Next time we'll do one clothed.
Relax, it's to scale.
Well you call it Primitive but I'm telling it's Figurative and that's what your nose looks like. If anything I've made it smaller.
Stop evolving!
It will be ready when it's ready.
No, I will not give you a mysterious 'come hither' smile.
His ears were bigger and he was holding a large boulder in his trunk
Draw me like one of your Lascaux girls.
I can never get the nose right.
I told you just 2 minutes ago; you don't get the roasted peanuts until the painting is completely done! I hate to tell you this, but your short-term memory is shot!
This ID should get you though the ICE age
I'm sorry, but cave drawings always put on ten pounds.
I look terrible - delete it!
I know, I know. It's just in case WE forget...
Don't like it? No problem, it's only temporary.
Look, we all start going bald at some point... fine, I'll add more hair.
Look, it’s not the painting that makes you look fat.
Actually, it hasn't been done before.
Don't worry, I will downplay the nose.
So everybody is a critic now!
What do you mean by reductive?
Please turn a little to the right.
It will be like you're frozen in time
What do you mean by “Too representational?”
Work with me here; stop closing your eyes!
Of course it doesn’t look like you; it’s pre-modernist art!
No, I can't make the trunk longer.
I find if I post everything I'm eating it keeps me more accountable.
Come on, can't you just keep it up for a minute longer?
I’ll draw a few more of you, add a few stick figures, and you watch ... we’ll be famous!
You can put your clothes back on now.
Don't tell me you've forgotten? It's called minimalism
Hold still, Lisa. I'm trying to capture that enigmatic smile.
I've shortened the tusks to give you a more modern look.
I agree. Mick drew your ears too small.
Did you have those surgically enhanced?
Everybody's a critic these days!
Yes, I can draw it so your trunk appears to look at a viewer anywhere in the cave.
Don't complain it doesn't look like you. It will in 20,000 years.
It's called "rubenesque".
Look, when you signed the release you knew you might be posing nude.
Come on. No one will ever believe you were all that big.
One day this will be known as Mammoth Cave.
I dumbed it down to keep it family friendly.
I like painting pictures of my food before I eat it.
I'm giving you a little more gravitas.
What'd you expect from The New Yorker?
I don't know Roger. It's lacking drama.
Okay, now say cheese.
Why? So people will know what you looked like if you go extinct! Now, up with that trunk and smile.
What could you possibly understand about minimalism.
Yes, I'll make sure the tusks look REALLY large!
When we discussed scale, I meant pay scale!
No, it really is that big.
The sonogram results will take one more stroke.
What do you mean it doesn’t look like you!
You might never forget but we will
She told me I needed to do more than just hunting for her to stick around.
The firelight hides your wrinkles.
Stop kvetching, I see my ophthalmologist next week!
Don’t worry, it’s just for practice, no one’s ever going to see it.
I know what you are. It's still called rhinoplasty.
This is a drawing of you for posterity - just in the event that you become extinct.
But global warming is a hoax! You will just love Africa, fur coat or no!
Everybodys' a critic. Stop already with the tsks, tsks.
I thought you said that was your good side.
Want me to airbrush out your stretch marks?
Tsk-tsk yourself! Let's see you try to draw me!
I call it, "Mastodon in the Room" - it's sure to catch on.
When we are dead, this is going to be worth millions, now stand still!
they say the walls add 10lbs
I'm getting real tired of being your mirror, Greg.
What? I call it a caricature.
President Trunk poses for his official portrait.
I only do herbivores. Carnivores get hungry.
Yes, yes, I'm sure this is your good side.
A little more expression, please.
For the last time, turn to the side! Try to look flat.
Paleoconservatives have commissioned a new symbol.
When we started this, it was erect. I'm not changing it now.
Hang on! I'll let you draw me in a minute.
Next time you want to point something out to me, use your words!
If you don't stand still you'll end up looking like a dog!
No, I did not make your ears look too big.
Well you draw it, then
Look, pretty soon we'll both be extinct.
I'm going for understatement of mammoth proportions.
I am not going to add wings and devil horns just to “Mess with the minds of future scientists.”
Realism is so yesterday. This is modern art--it's not supposed to look like you.
If you don't like it, you invent painting.
Don't worry, everyone looks 10lbs heavier on the wall
Don't worry: I'll caveshop it later.
Just a few steps closer. Trust me. It’s only there to keep us warm.
Yes, your butt does look that big.
Trust me, it's your better side.
Okay, get your trunk up. Break's over!
Yeah, well, the cave wall adds 20 pounds.
It’s your good side.
If only my perspective weren't just one-dimensional.
When I'm done you'll never forget it.
Hold still if you want history to see your tusks.
Plato said what?
Because I liked you better when you were a baby.
I don’t do tusks.
It’s not a phase mom, it’s who I am.
Try that enigmatic smile again.
Hold still. I'm capturing you before you start leaning to the right.
If you can’t hold still, someday they’ll think you were a giant anteater!
They all say they won’t date someone without a good pic!
First fire, now pictures, what next? A round thing I can travel on?
Look, I'm a realist. I'm not going to shave off 10 pounds just because it'll make you feel better about your portrait.
c'mon, look alive.
Yes. OK. For another fifty bucks I can make your trunk look bigger.
No I can't make your butt smaller, it's mammoth!
This is what you will look like without tusks. Shall we remove them?
Give me that Mona Lisa smile.
I don't work for peanuts, you know.
You think your trunk's tired, my arm is killing me.
This is a petroglyph...not a realistic portrait,Alphonse!
Yes, it definitely shows off the junk in your trunk
Oh? So now you're the expert on primitive art?
Can you make me woolier?
No, of course I'm not trying to make you look fat.
Tiny tusks make your trunk look bigger.
Hold still. If we don't do this, they'll never believe we were both here at the same time.
Yes, yes .... I’ll capture your subtle allure.
Okay, now give me, "flirtatious."
"One day they will find Picasso shared 2% of my DNA".
It'll be a discussion piece: "Elephant. In the room."
I'm getting 'woolly,' but I need more 'mammoth' from you.
One more crack that it looks like a dog with a crooked nose and you'll find yourself just another woolly mammoth out of a modeling job.
Need more light.Blow on fire
Pleasingly plump I'd say. But, have you heard of the Holocene diet?
I left them off the drawing because they might frighten the children, ok?
Yeah, your butt is that big!
Truth is, you're a bit long in the tusk.
I did tell you this cave adds ten pounds.
This had better get us both discovered.
Hold still because I need to get this done before you become extinct.
Barb's going with fossilization but I felt like this better captured my essence.
This light really makes your trunk look smaller.
No I did not make you look fat, you are fat!
Back off, buddy. Can't you see I'm making a shopping list?
You may not think that it looks like you—but it will.
When I'm finished, then you can draw me.
All done! Our special today is two 8 by 10's and 10 wallet sizes in the caves of your choice
It's not graffiti! It's portraitture.
Thank you for not charging.
Damn it, I said stay still!
I see myself as being more a man in a cave.
Stay still I’m trying to prevent you from becoming irrelephant!
Paint me like one of your French mammoths.
And if you must know, baby elephants came from the sky.
Tusk, Tusk, Tusk!
Yes, I remember saying it wouldn't take long.
For the sake of posterity, try to look a little more extinct.
If your kid could do it better, why doesn't he do it.
That's it! Would you mind sending the donkey in?
What??? You can't hold it? I just started painting!
No, I can’t remember you if you leave.
Had a Woolly Mammoth in here yesterday...acted like there's no tomorrow.
Sorry. This is the only sonogram covered by your insurance.
Yes, I am glad we are both vegetarians.
Hey, I hunted him, I ate him, I know what he looks like!
Try looking like your about to charge at me
Yes, I know your tusks are your best feature.
I'm calling it Mammoth byFirelight.
You're lucky I picked painting over the piano.
Of course not...You don't look fat
You blinked. I'll have to redo it.
This is how you could look after only 30 days on a Paleo diet
If you don't hold still I'll never finish.
Why do all you guys want a bigger trunk?
Don't worry. I'm a master, Don.
We'll put up your picture, write a short bio & see if you get any likes.
I need more feeling!
Someday, everyone will be putting pictures of their dinner on their wall.
Stand still! You'll thank me in 20,000 years.
Define Neanderthal.
Hold still, your selfie's almost done.
Now that I have fire I can see I need to work on perspective
That's it! Give me sassy! Give me sexy!
It does too look like you, and ‘yes’ left-handed is a thing.
Hey, I'm an impressionist, not a realist.
Yes, I'm well aware that some people will consider it 'derivative'!
I can't focus with you in the room.
I told you, the cave adds ten pounds.
No, I haven't forgotten to draw your tusks . . . they just aren't as long as you think.
Stop thinking about climate change and smile!
How can I get a good picture if you keep closing your eyes?
Can you turn your tusks a little to the right please?
This is going on your permanent record.
I'll bring out your inner Mastodon.
What? It's abstrunk expressionism.
The tusks? Let's just call them my fee for painting your portrait
Settle down, no need to rush -- it's not like you're going extinct.
Now bring in the donkey.
Remove the double chins and whiten the tusks. Anything else?
'Please hold still, it's only a matter of time before we're both extinct.'
Next!
Now pretend you are being attacked by a lion.
Ok, I get it. You will remember this long after I'm gone. Now can we just get on with it?
Is that REALLY how you want to be seen in 100,000 years?
A neolithic experiment in life drawing ended tragically when the sitter lost patience and trampled the artist
I have invented cave painting. Now you can look young and handsome, forever.
Look alive.
Great art never goes extinct.
I'm hornier than that.
Everyone's a critic.
Smile
I haven't fucking finished yet!!!
You moved. Have to start over again.
Could you smile please?
By the way, I’m hoping you can stay for dinner.
Should we talk about the elephants in the room?
So you think you could do better, Mr. no opposable thumb?
I'm trying to show your good side.
How would you know what your ‘best side’ is?
You'll get your peanuts after I'm finished, just like we agreed.
Oh, for heaven's sake! Is everyone a critic?
Every time you move I have to start over.
It's for your own safety. If I include the tusks, ivory hunters will be all over this place.
Thank you for posing in the nude.
It's art. It's minimalism. Deal with it.
Okat,...can you turn your trunk to the left and let's try it without the tusks.
What do you mean...it's too painterly?
Don't worry, firelight is very forgiving.
Let me draw you before you become extinct.
Am I going nuts or did you draw me with two left feet?
Quit complaining, it's just the first draft.
No, I will not make your trunk look longer than it is.
Goose me again and I'll give you a tattoo you'll never forget!
Hey, smile a little so some future anthropologist won't nickname you Wooly Bully.
So what do you think of the paleolithic filter?
No, truly, the underlight is very flattering!
I was given a 10,000-year residency.
What do you mean, you prefer your right profile?
This could be you after mid-terms.
You must join me in Provence this Spring.
Stop blinking!!
Sometimes I think the only way you'd stand still is if you were frozen in a block of ice.
We never agreed this should be life-sized.
You said to make the nose a little smaller. Now, does THIS look like the guy who hit you?
Believe me, long-term you're better off without the tusks
You are big! It’s the caves that got small!
Mona Lisa you're not. So wipe that smile off your face.
I don't have time to argue with you. The saber tooth family is waiting and I'm on a deadline here.
Two hundred thousand years from now they call it Photoshoping.
If you don't stand still, I'm adding tons and tons of fur.
No, your discounted price does not include a frame.
Mmmm baby, work it, work it! Show the cave some love!
It’s not as big as you think it is
Try to look fierce.
This is in case they don't find our time capsule.
No comments from the peanut gallery!
Perfect. An emoji for the ages!
Okay. Slip on the bathrobe and we'll take a break.
I need an enigmatic smile.
Enjoy that fire pal, because the Ice Age is coming...whatever that is.
Of course it doesn't look like you. I'm an artist and you're a republican!
I can leave the tusks out if you want a less poach-worthy look.
I'm done arguing.Cave light does not add a pound.
a little less tusk!
No, you can't upload it.
Yes, I know it's not to scale.
This is mini you.
If you can't stand still there are plenty of pigs in Sulawesi who'll work for half the money.
Ceci n’est pas une mastodon.
I'll paint the tusks when I'm good and ready!
Act a little more alive.
Hey, take it easy, ok?! I might be no DaVinci...but you are definitely NO 'Mona Lisa'...
Calm down, I'll make your tusks look bigger.
Damn it, SMILE!
It’s how I prefer to remember you.
"I'd like to see you try it, Mister "I don't have thumbs".
I know you did mine by memory, but I'm just not there yet!
No, you don't get paid extra for posing in the buff.
Thighs are painted to proportion.  I invented fire but I’m not a miracle worker.
If you stand still a little bit longer you'll be famous in 10,000 years.
I'd like the smile to be a bit more enigmatic, if you please.
Can you do it again? I think I blinked.
No—it doesn't make you look ten pounds heavier!
You can send in the stick figures now.
Prehistoric Pictionary
Stay still! I want to finish before you're extinct.
You want Cubism? We haven't even invented the wheel yet.
Yeah, you’re paying, but I paint it as I see it.
I'm losing fire light here. Can we negotiate the licensing later?
No exceptions. Profiles only!
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
Stand still, you will go down in prehistory...
But the tusks are a part of you.
The guys with the spears should be here soon.
What do you mean I made you look like an elephant.
Oh, cute, maybe your snout would like to take the brush.
So, this is what you will look like without your tusks
It's stone on wall. We have to go to Grog's studio to do oil on canvas!
But how will they know if it is completely accurate or not? By the time these caves are discovered, we will all be extinct.
Of course, it's primitive look around.
Give me the brush. You did my trunk all wrong...
What do you mean "It's trademarked"?
What did you expect? I said I'm Paleo Picasso... not Pablo.
Hang on, don't move, but...was that mouse there before?
I'm really more of an impressionist...
It's called artistic license. You okay with that?
Kehinde Wiley got to paint President Obama, and me? I'm stuck here with the opposition party.
Stop moving! I want to finish this before it gets really, really really cold.
Yeah, yeah, everyone’s a critic.
After ending Obamacare, stopping immigration, and defunding liberal colleges, the GOP turned its focus to its 2020 platform.
I haven't had the tusk lesson yet.
Don't move...this is for posterity.
Now let me see that enigmatic insouciance.
If I leave your tusks off, they'll leave you alone!
This will be better than finding your fossils, trust me!
You want to be PINK!
Oh yah, well I'd love to see you do any better, Mr. "I-Have-A-Process."
Yea I know I'm no Da Vinci. And in case you haven't noticed, you ain't no Mona Lisa either.
This is not an elephant
Whoa! You weren't supposed to see this.
Let's see YOU do one that's better.
Objects in shelter are closer than they appear.
The lighting in this studio sucks
Trust me. For trunk pics, it'll look more mammoth if it's less wooly.
Stop saying “tsk, tsk.” I haven’t learned to paint them yet.
Don't know why we're even bothering, nobody is going to care how long your trunk was come next week, never mind 4 million years from now
Would you feel comfortable taking off your tusks?
I think it's great that you decided to set up a profile.
It's called photoshop.
Fred begins his Pachyderm blue period."
Now, just the tiniest little smile.
Stand still! This will go down in history.
Do you even know what 'enigmatic' means?
I'm a minimalist big guy.
The tusks will be an extra two rocks.
I’ll need you for the ceiling.
The donkey also wouldn't smile.
I’ll finish the portrait when you return from vacation. By the way, why did you choose La Brea?
THIS IS A GIRL MASTADON....YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM DIFFERENT, DUMBO....
Sorry, they say cave drawings add a few pounds.
I cannot do those tusks justice.
Well, what else did you expect? You knew I was a Primitivist when you hired me to do your portrait.
They will not think that your trunk was six inches long.
You think it makes you look fat?
I told you.You have no 'best' side.
Could you turn a little to the left?
Oh you know what they say, the cave wall always adds 1,000 pounds.
You don't have a 'good' side!
Hello?!… I said bring in the sabertooth tiger.
If you have to sneeze hold it in. I just learned how to make that.
You're an elephant. Remember that.
No! I already made your butt look smaller. I'm not going to make your tusks look bigger.
Don't worry, primitivism is all the rage.
I don’t care if you’re a Democrat. Just sign the release.
Of course it's a representation. No, your ass is not fat. Quit fidgeting.
If you don't stand still, this is going to look pretty amateurish.
Don't forget, this is how you'll be remembered.
No, I did not make your nose too big.
I keep telling you, I understand scale.
Is it E before I or I before E?
I said, “I’ll draw the elephant in the room.” Not “I’ll address the elephant in the room.”
I’ll include a caption when you invent writing.
Ok, fine. I’ll give you hair.
Staying warm indoors during the Pleistocene era, by playing the earliest-recorded game of Pictionary.
Tusks are extra.
I pay you peanuts because you're an elephant, not because you're my muse.
They might or might not find your bones, but there's a much better chance this painting could show up thousands of years from now and give you your itty-bitty shot at immortality.
I am telling you for the last time size does not matter.
I am not going to keep making your trunk longer!
I'm tring to immortalize you here, stop fidgeting...
All right, already. I know it doesn't look exactly like you. It's modern art.
I'm calling this series "National Geographic."
And this lighter area down the front will make your nose look less...bulky.
Stop fretting, the cave wall adds ten pounds
With a longer handle to this brush I could come over there and paint a selfie.
After the orthodontist deals with those tusks, this is what you’ll look like
No, I do not think this makes you look fat.
Art history lessons at Lascaux: "Ceci n'est pas un mastodonte."
Are you wedded to that "tusked" look?
Should I put a foot note that says "not to scale?"
Yeah.. now how about a half-smile?
He looked just like you, but had no hair, and he said he was called an elephant. I said i'd never heard of such a ridiculous .
When I’m finished, I think I’ll name it after myself, “Master Don”.
I'm trying to capture the illusive quality of your mysteriously coy smile.
Whaddya mean, that's not your good side?
Hold still! Just because your species can draw from memory doesn't mean the rest of us can!
Hard to believe, Jumbo, but I’ve known you since you were this high.
No, seriously. How big do you want the tusks?
A little bit of a smile would be helpful.
The one you did of me was MUCH tinier.
One more time, turn to the right so that I can capture the firelight glistening off your tusks.
Good, just move your head a little to the right.
Why not? Bison paintings are so cliché.
Marta, get the scoop.
Now, don't move!!
What do you mean, I make you look fat?
Paint me like one of your cave girls
Now, could you give me a full profile and lower those tusks just a bit?
You are "The elephant in the room."
(Caveman) What do you mean there's something a little wrong with the trunk?
It’s in case you forget what you look like.
Will you please stop blinking?
Hang on...I've still got to capture the room.
This ain’t National Geographic, it’s for The Daily Beast.
Sure it's miniature. I'm writing your early history.
I'm aiming for The Met but I'll settle for Natural History.
What do you mean it lacks perspective? Flat is good.
Don’t give that look—your trunk is that big
Don’t give that ‘art is extinct’ mammoth shit.
It seems too conservative.
Don’t give that ‘art is extinct’ mammoth shit.
OK, so you're no Mona Lisa and I'm no da Vinci. Let's just finish this.
Don't worry. You'll look mammoth when I'm finished.
Next week on Lascaux's Next Top Model...
Caveman addressing the elephant in the room.
All right,already! I'll take off a few pounds.
Lighten up. I said it's a "distinct" likeness, not an"extinct" likeness.
Should I paint a spaceship next to you, just to mess with the folks who discover me in 50,000 years?
If you don't stand still, I'm adding 500 pounds.
Look, the mammoth I had in here last week didn't ask for a SINGLE break during his entire hour-long session.
I usually don’t do nudes
I work for peanuts too.
Could you turn your head just a little to the right?
You’ve got good bones.
Too literal?
Hope you like it. I went a little less "mammoth" and a little more "woolly".
Hold still. We don’t want future humans thinking you’re wooly.
The cave wall always adds ten pounds.
It's a new invention of mine. It's called fire. Why?
THAT'S what you think I look like?!
Quit moving! I'd like to finish this before you become extinct.
You're a little long in the tooth to be posing like that.
What did you expect? You're paying me peanuts!
Guess again. Its not a mouse
One more time with the tusks and I won’t put them in!
It’s your good side.
In my opinion, Botox is not going to do it. You need some extreme Rhinoplasty.
I know it doesn't look like you, but it will.
Five more minutes and I'll toast the marshmallows!
I know Ralph. You want urbane, dignified and conservative. But I'm seeing sexy with tones of flamboyance and risqué. Think Chris Christy.
Try to look less posed.
That is your good tusk!
OK, you want "Friends Only," ... what should I put down for your "Status?"
If you're not happy with this drawing, do it yourself!
For now it's you. Eventually we'll call it the Party of Lincoln.
This size is only a representation; I know that you're mammoth.
Since you'll be the symbol of the Party that takes away protection against killing you and your family for parts or fun, let's leave out the tusks on this portrait.... okay?
This will evolve to an online class.
Suddenly you're a damn art critic?
If I had a real light, I would have painted you on the ceiling.
For a few bucks more I can add tusks and a longer trunk.
Take a break—I’m going to add the spears now.
What do you mean, you’re uncomfortable posing nude?
I'm not making it anatomically correct.
Art's a long-term investment. Be patient.
Relax, I'm an impressionist!
Is this your first time modelling nude?
It's not my fault. The cave wall adds 100 pounds.
I just paint what I see — I can’t help it if you look mammoth!
Don't worry, your official portrait will be done on something more long-lasting.
Okay, now show me demure.
I swear, if this one doesn't sell I'm cutting off an ear!
No! Turn to the side--perspective hasn't been invented yet.
You want perfection, buy a camera!
What do you mean I'm creating unrealistic standards? We always take out your wrinkles post-production.
I'm trying to make you look younger.
No, I own the copyright but you’ll receive 40% of all sales.
Keep your trunk up....I am not finished....
OK, I'll make your trunk longer.
No. I won't make the ears smaller or give you less grey hair.
Hold still. I need to finish your portrait before you become extinct.
Trust me, after the flood you’ll be glad we took the time.
C'mon baby! Work it!
Probably not. More than likely they'll call it, 'The elephant in the Cave'.
Objects on cave wall are closer than they appear.
Lighten up, will you? 40,000 years from now, nobody will care!
You all think your trunk is larger than life.
Stand still, pretend you are happy, this is what selfies are made of.
Stop complaining...doing your portrait is a mammoth undertaking.
Hold still. You will soon be extinct.
It’s called artistic integrity.
Sorry but that's how I imagine you in the nude.
No! I won't make your trunk look bigger.
Sure, we would all like to lose a few pounds, but I’m telling you Paleo is a fad.
Can you strike a slightly more enigmatic expression?
I don't like it. Rub it out and start over.
Yes, I did not forget what you said at the last critique. You act like you are the only one with a memory.
It's very disappointing that there's no new cartoon this week; could you please at least acknowledge when that's not happening and publish the date we can expect the next one? Thank you very much!
...a little less tooth on that smile...
I'm a mimilist impressionist. I'm not worried about the size of your tusks.
Don't worry, no one will see this.
Is it too much to ask you to look more "enigmatic"?
Be sure you get my good side
It gives me goosebumps to think that people from a future generation will build their entire careers around studying my drawings.
I'm gonna leave the tusks off...they just make you look older.
You do to look like that!
No, I will not make your trunk look longer for posterity! (Italicize the word "not")
I'm not making you look fat. You ARE fat.
It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.
I can't do hair.
I need my artwork to be seen as historic, not so much pre-historic.
Steve, the volcanos are erupting. I think there are more important things to worry about than whether or not my trunk is too big in your drawing.
I know your trunk is bigger, its called artistic expression!
Want me to make you a unicorn?
Ok, I can't do this if you keep moving.
His critics were savage.
Oh, don't be so shy. I promise nobody else will ever see this.
Wipe that smile off your . . . no, wait!
Can you try to look more extinct ?
If I include those teeth, it's going to really mess with whoever finds my drawings
Well if you think it stinks, you draw it!
C'mon...lift up your trunk a little...I promise, no one's gonna see these....
Just think, Some Day Your Relatives Will be led in circles and work for peanuts.
No, I'm pretty sure you did move.
Don't make my tusks look fat
I am not trying to make you look fat.
Hold on. I think I've captured your essence.
In the old days, you guys were wilder and woolier.
Me write pithy caption now!
This is for posterity, so give me an enigmatic smile.
Trust me, we're going to be discovered.
No! I'm not going to draw it longer just to impress someone 500 years from now.
It's not your spirit animal. It's mine.
Don't worry, the carving adds ten pounds
Because wallpaper hasn't been invented yet.
Grog use cave wall - assure your privacy.
And you drew me with a huge forehead, so now we're even.
I am just doing your good side.
Let me see you do better.
Can I get you to make my ears smaller?
It's a cartoon.
Let’s pick this back up again tomorrow, I’m losing the good light.
Extinction takes off ten years.
You're my first plus-size model.
I should have gone with the bowl of fruit.
I'm not going for realism, ok?
How do you spell your last name?
It's called artistic interpretation, not fake news.
Move again and no peanuts!
I charge extra for family portraits.
Yes, if I had a better memory you wouldn't have to be here.
Quit bellowing --it's either draw you or eat you.
Hold still--I won't be able to get this when you're extinct.
It's not like leaving off the tusks makes you any thinner.
This is why I can't play Pictionary with you... a peanut... really?!?
Your party's policies seem backward to me.
"I'm calling it 'Woolly Mammoth'. 'Mastodon' doesn't capture your 'joie de vivre'".
Hold still! This is your last chance for immortality!
My in-laws are coming over, I thought it would be appropriate to have an elephant in the room.
Well you weren't very generous drawing my trunk either.
I’m calling it, ‘Mastodon in the Nude’ .
No, you're not my first. Have you heard of Mammoth Lisa?
You're not fat, the petroglyph adds 20 pounds.
Quit squirming, we're losing the light!
It will be worth millions in years to come.
Smile! and just remember---this is for the ages!
OK ... I will make your trunk longer.
How about a little less Woolly and a little more Mammoth?
Ok. Makeover possibility #1: we lose the tusks. See?
So the tusks are too short. It's art. Get over it.
It’s the *idea* of you I’m after!
My rendering of the elephant in the room. Pretty good considering I don't see you...
Any slower, and I'll evolve.
It's an homage.
You'll survive longer if they think you have no tusk.
This would be a lot cuter if you wore that adorable sweater I knitted for you.
Not so, if I wanted all the credit I'd draw a picture of the hot sticks I made.
Keep still and I´ll put in a good word for you at our next hunt.
Its called neo-neolithic, actually.
Before I finish this portrait, can we please address the elephant in the room?
I hope he tastes better than he paints.
Yeah, yeah, everyone’s a critic.
I don't have any peanuts in my budget, but I can pay you in exposure.
Representation is a defence against the Real.
C'mon! I did what you asked and made your trunk and backside look smaller...So why still the poopie face?!
The Republicans need a logo.
Really? I look like an ant eater!
They're saying my art is just too B.C.
It's called the unspeakable truth.
This is my perspective.
Stop moving! I’m working on perspective.
Almost done, just putting on the final tusks.
Quit moving or I'll invent the still life.
The LasCaux's think their spotted horse is so great. You're going to be mammoth.
I can never get the tusks right.
The paintbrush adds 100 pounds
You're not fat, the wall adds 10 pounds
Well, it’s like Groucho said, ‘In Alabama, the tusks are looser.’
This is my early work.
You know what they say, 'Cave painting or it didn't happen.'
Man, is that really what I look like?
If you can't hold still there will be no walk through the tar pits.
I agreed to the nude, not to the life sized.
It's called fire and it really brings out the color in your eyes.
You're not as wooly as I remember.
You said you could capture my essence, this looks very cavemanish...
I don't care if you suffer from TD, get that trunk up.
Remember, please, this image is for the ages!
If you must know, Gary, I’m working on my novel.
Whadda' you mean slimmer?
I don't look that fat
I want you to draw me like one of your Lascaux girls, Jarg
,Why can't you keep it up?
Donald and a Little Marco, The Prequel
The cave wall adds a couple of pounds
What do you mean, "Draw me like your French mammoths"?
Okay I know how this must look, but I swear to you I'm a gatherer.
It's big enough! That's just an urban legend anyway.
Yes, I realize that you don't pose for mere peanuts....
"Of course it doesn't look like you. I'm a Primitivist".
I'm not including the ivory tusks because those are no longer considered art -- it's a long story.
No, I don’t think it makes you look hippy at all!
I know it's the bronze age but I still dabble in the Paleolithic style.
Don’t quit your day job.
If I make you look any thinner, you won't be an elephant anymore.
They say the cave adds 10lbs
No I CAN'T make it any bigger
hold still, I’m not going to be here forever.
No, I don’t think that it makes you look fat.
I want to tell everyone who did all the pooping in here.
Hold still. I'm not good at tusks.
It is your thin side!
If you want to be remembered as you are, don't move!
I brought you in from the cold. The least you can do is hold still while I get the tusks right.
No looking till it’s finished!
A switch to my paleo diet would help you shed those extra pounds.
If this turns out blurry, that's your fault!
And then you promise I'll have my cave back?
I swear, you are the only elephant I have ever invited up to my studio
I'll call it 'The elephant in the room' and see if that flies.
You want tusks how big?
Ogg called it primitive. I say it's representational!
When I'm dead this will be worth a lot.
For the last time: the tusks go on when you stop blowing out that fire!
I needn't ask who forgot to take his Viagra this morning.
Of course you were cuter then, but now you’re beautiful.
I'm tired of the "which is your better side" argument, and I'm not about to switch sides of the cave now.
But you DO have a week chin.
I said give me more mammoth, not mastodon.
Alright, but you're dating yourself. Tusks have been done and done.
Masta Don, I presume.
I am done with you. Go find some guys with spears now.
How do you keep those things up?
I can’t do this if you keep dropping your nose.
What's wrong now? You said you wanted me to make you look younger.
You know the wall paint adds 10lbs.
Watch and learn.
Don't worry, I have Photoshop.
Normally, I try to avoid cliches.
Well then fine! Ochre it is!
No, you don't get paid 'til it's done.
Turn a bit further to the right, and hold it.
I know you won’t forget, but I will.
You're paying in ivory, right?
I hope it's not too "hunter-gatherer"
Hey, no evolving!
I'm an Impressionist. You don't like it, find someone with an IPhone.
This is just your temporary ID. Your permanent ID will arrive in about 30,000 to 40,000 years.
And now I am going to depict my life struggles
Keep the tusks up.
What? It’s not like you’re the Monalisa or something!
Stop complaining. It is a painting, not a photograph.
First man who took picture of his meal.
It wouldn't hurt if you showed less tusk.
Some day you’ll be famous.
I'm a caveman - what do you expect?
Ok, now go out there and let’s do better in the second half!
At least the modeling is over.
Don't be upset, Petroglyphs add at least 15 lbs
Hold still, please. Right after fire, we're inventing art.
Hold still or they'll think you're a mammoth.
For the last time, I am NOT drawing that to scale.
Early man struggles with the short narrative.
Some day you will appear on the cover of The New Yorker!
Don't worry. The zebra will be smaller.
It is your good side. No one will ever see it anyway.
Plato's gonna love this...
What! Timmy's in the well?!
Some day you are going to be able to say you had your portrait done by the man that discovered fire
Listen, you’re only here because it was hard to come by flowers, fruits, and a pretty vase. So get with the program!
. . . so I won't forget.
Well, preliterate publications have described my art as quintessentially "Upper Paleolithic."
It's called Evolution...from you, to this, to.....Donald Trump?! Maybe you should seriously consider Extinction!
No, you don't get paid more for posing in the nude.
I will be done a lot sooner if you stop trying to blow out the fire.
Move again and you’re extinct.
So you made the fire. Big deal. This will be in the March 5th issue of The New Yorker!
Look, everyone knows the cave wall adds 10 pounds.
No, I won't give her bigger boobs just this once.
I know there’s more to you than this but do you really think that 20000 years from now they’re gonna notice that I didn’t actually capture your true essence?
im going to refer to this as art, after you,Art. so stay still, and you will be famous.
Yes, it's you. That's how you look. Go away.
Yes, this is the living room - why do you ask?
You’re an elephant, I’m an artist......I guess we both work for peanuts.
No, I will not make your nose smaller. Without artistic Integrity, I have nothing.
Sorry, can't make it any faster with this selfie stick.
Your smile is always the hardest part to capture.
Stop complaining, I'm doing the best I can. Besides, no one else will ever see it.
Why on earth would you want a rainbow coming out of your trunk?
I think it's flattering.
I decided to make you look younger.
I need them for the piano!
Can you make my tusks look longer?
A little more to the right.
Yes it's small, but that will make your tusks look bigger.
I can give you a full head of hair and make your tusks look HUGE if you’ll help move some lumber later...
You look less woolly in person.
No, darling. It’s all wrong. Rethink it. Less tusk. More trunk. And lose the gum.
I'm gonna make you a unicorn. I'm not good at drawing horns.
it was suppose to be a surprise
So, are you going to remember all this?
You can't be Kilroy because I want to be Kilroy
Hey, shutup, its prehistoric, not postmodern! Everybody's a critic! Geesh!
Hold still, no one has tried this before.
Relax. Don't be so self-conscience. Your ears look fine. In a millenia they'll be ten times the size.
Give me a break. I'm doing everything Bob Ross tells us to do.
I don’t usually use an agency model but this is going to be a painting for the ages
No, I won't make your tusks look longer.
Don't you start with your trumpeting. It's a new trend called minimalism.
You didn't get my good side.
Because it’s how I see you—that’s why. Now hold still.
I know you’re upset about climate change. But come on, It’s almost done. Trunk up!
You keep furling that trunk, we’re gonna be here all day.
It's called realism. Get used to it.
Ceci n'est pas un elephant.
Come on, you know the brush adds five tons.
Ganesh, one day they will all worship you
Stand Still. Be fossilized.
It's not small. It's mammoth!
Don't worry, everybody knows that size doesn't matter.
You were supposed to roast the marshmallows!
If you can’t stand still, people will think you were fatter then your descendants.
Sorry, Impressionism hasn't been invented yet.
It's not supposed to be realistic. I'm a Pre-Impressionist.
You never forget, yeah. How many times do I have to tell you to keep facing left
....just try to smile in a more enigmatic way
I did NOT draw you fat.
I'll try my best to keep you to scale.
Okay, I drew it shorter, but I still think you're being oversensitive about the length of your nose.
The glacier will keep, just hold still.
You DON'T look fat.
I don't know what to tell you, I drew it proportional to your body.
er....because the tusks make you look fat.
Keep still or no peanuts.
The day will come when we will surpass primitive art! A great artist will actually depict a tomato soup can!
Okay I will rub out a few wrinkles but just "touching up" the gray is not an option.
I'm giving it a modernist feel.
Now, a little smile.
That's how big you think my ass is?
What? I'm drawing you!
I can't believe my ears are that small.
Relax. I can photoshop it.
Hold still. This 'll be one for the ages.
This is for posterity. What do you mean you don't remember?
It's prepostmodern.
No, they won't. But they won't really know who the model for the Mona Lisa is either.
It does look an awful lot like the perp, but to be honest, we all look exactly the same.
Quarter turn to your right, please.
Don't worry, this will get tons of likes.
Shorter? But it gives you such character!
If we can get rid of the tusks your progeny will propagate the earth.
Do you think it looks primitive enough?
Don't criticize until I'm done. I've captured wooly mammoths, reindeer, bulls, and handprints like no one else.
My parents are still disappointed I didn't become a mammoth hunter.
Because elephants don't play poker, that's why!
I prefer naturalism. Modernism is a fad and we'll be here long after that's extinct.
I never said I was a realist.
Is that the mate you are looking for?
Models of your talent are nearly extinct.
No, I'm not going to "enhance your assets" for the drawing!
Damn! Lighting is too warm.
I am sorry but I need to leave space for others
Of course it doesn't do you justice. I'm a modernist.
That looks nothing like me.
If you looked like this maybe I'd fuck you once in a while!
Sorry, the cave wall adds ten pounds...
Let's see those pearly whites.
Do that in here again and your days will be numbered!
First I memorialize you; then I eat you.
Everyone's a critic.
I know you do, but think of all the fun misinformation we can cause drawing you without tusks.
They will never believe I didn't just imagine you in a few thousand years.
Don't smile if you want to be able to use this for your passport.
Stop wiggling your ears.
I know it's not to scale. I'm not some kind of caveman.
The censors don't care whether or not it is flaccid.
Okay, I made your trunk shorter; should I include the tusks?
I suppose the next thing you’ll complain about is disappearing megafauna, more Pleistocene fake news.
Yes, it shows your eyes closed again. You blinked!
I think I found the perfect shade of gray.
Sorry but I only do neo-primitive...
Oh don't be so self-conscious, they say that the cavestone adds 250 pounds.
As a starving artist, I can relate to getting paid peanuts for your work.
Stop smirking. This is your chance for immortality.
This is becoming a mammoth undertaking.
You moved again.
I realize I’m no Picasso, but you’re no Ivanka Trunk.
But you said this is your better side.
My therapist says if I keep at it I’ll get perspective.
It was life-size portrait when I started!
You are really bigly big but I must draw you to the best of my ability for posterity. I cannot differentiate between a mammoth and a mastodon at this scale, but surely, your Siberia connection is unmistakable.
your gender, please?
Work it! Work it!
Good. Now give me sexy vixen.
What do you think, too tusky?
This could be worth something in a few hundred thousand years.
Look, I don't really care about your guarantees. It's as plain as the nose on your face -- you do have small ears.
The last pictures I stored on the cloud got ruined when it rained.
Hold still and try not to look so serious.
I'm paying you to be pretty, not for your opinion.
Yes, I know your tusks are bigger than that.
And after we got priced out of Brooklyn, where else could we go?
If I draw them that way everyone will think they are fake.
First, we have to address the elephant in the room.
Not for you. So I don't forget!
Would it kill you to give me an enigmatic smile?
You are mammoth.
Will you stop with the spitballs!
You have to stand sideways!
Don't worry...the cave wall adds 50 pounds
Everyone's a critic all of a sudden.
This was your Mom, before we ate her!
Keep in mind that cave drawings add ten pounds.
You go around the left side,I throw the ball to you and you take it in for a touchdown.We win.
You know what's really wild? A troglodyte. Or, at least, their girlfriends are.
But on inside, Ug had passion for fine art.
I'm into painting and gathering
It is you when your trunk didn't need viagra.
For the last time, only the model gets naked!
You really need to go see the Mastodonist.
In case you forget.
Of course it looks like a potato. You look like a potato.
It's not exactly the enigmatic smile that I was looking for.
It's called Impressionism, OK, so now hold still
I know it's not realistic. That's why I call it Impressionism.
And don’t you forget!
I am NOT fat-shaming you!
I know it’s a little avant garde today but I think it will really get recognized in the next ice age.
I'm telling you, Martha, the glow of the firelight will take ten years off of your face.
Trust me. It's accurate.
Stay still or I'll have to invent the eraser!
You get the idea
That’s because you ARE naked!”
See? It looks stupid when I paint your trunk short.
You want to be remembered, don't you?
Yes you do have a big nose Live with it!
You'll never forget this.
Could you look more prehistoric?
I meant if you go extinct!
Now hold still, I can only do this once.
Calm down. The big nose doesn't make you look fat.
Yes, that is what you look like.
See, this is the way I want your trunk to be -- straight out in front! And the tusks down, if you can do that.
Damn it, Mona, would a slight grin kill you?
People will be admiring this for centuries
Don't worry about the action scenes; we'll bring in a double.
The wall really adds ten pounds
Are you sure she was wearing figure skates?
Ok, now hold your tusks erect but relaxed...
I think I captured the depth of your existential dread.
It's your better side.
Longer horns? Sure, it's not like it's carved in stone.
It's got to be a nude, it's for Playmammoth Magazine.
I'm hoping to be discovered soon.
Where have you been for the the past three years? You’ve gained about two tons. I’ll have to start over.
I hate this as much as you do, but please stand still. They say someday I'll be discovered.
Stand still while I paint the Mammath Lisa.
I guess we’ll see in a million years if you’re actually big-boned.
It does not make you look fat, and besides, no one will ever see this.
As with many great artists, Zog’s masterpieces were met with indifference by audiences of the era.
What do you mean, the style feels dated?!
Yesterday I invented art. Today I invented artistic license, so I can draw you looking scared if I want to.
I know I haven't said much but I can't stop thinking about the fact that there is the elephant in my room.
You may not know this, but in a few years this moment will literally be frozen in time.
I know it's crude.
I'm not certain that I can capture your true essence.
I have told you a M times, quit swaying around!
If you must know, any resemblance to actual mastodons, living or dead, is coincidental.
I'm going to paint you like one of those French woolly mammoths.
Don’t blame me. The limestone adds ten pounds.
.. ok, ok, I’m not gonna make you look too toothy!
So as far as you recall this is who squirted the water at you.
Finding you a mate is gonna take forever if you keep swiping left.
It's called "The elephant in the cave" i'm gonna feature it in my next trunk show.
I know it's not an exact likeness, but art is supposed to capture the subject's essence, not its superficialities.
The fire adds ten pounds.
I only paint what I see, so yes, this is what you really look like.
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French Mammoths.
Now, try to look like you're flirting,
No, art does not have to be life-size!
The Democrats picked a WHAT?
No, I haven't been to Lascaux.
NOW you tell me that's not your best side.
You forgot again, trunk up... up!
I'm looking for more intensity
And you're no Michelle Obama.
10,000 years from now they'll call it a masterpiece
Sure, take all the time you need to draw me. It's not like the Pleistocene epoch is ending tomorrow.
The original Fox News.
And in a few days, you can swipe your trunk left for a new female profile.
Oh yeah? Well I might not be 'a cave-painter de Vinci,' but you're for sure no damn Mona Lisa!
No, I can't make you look 'less grey'.
And that's how babies are made.... or you will become extint
Cool it! I'm not going to make you look fat.
What do you mean it looks nothing like you?
Impressionism. It's called Impressionism. You want Realism, you'll have to wait 12,000 years.
Some say my depictions are primitive. But I see my work as having elements of modernist abstraction.
I'm having a retrospective at the Museum of Natural History
No, you don't look a little "long in the tooth".
Wendel, I found us a home, made it warm, decorated it nicely. So what if I am wearing your mother?
Hey, your five minute break's over. Get that trunk back up!
Next I draw the island, add a tree, come up with a funny caption, and we’re done!
stop posting ugly photos of me on my wall
Yes, your nose really is that big.
No, I'm not Michelangelo. I prefer to think of myself as Picasso in his primitive phase.
Thank you for posing in the nude.
No you're not... the campfire adds ten pounds.
Can you please tell your party to stop cuting funding for the arts?
Listen big shot, long after you are extinct, they will revere me and my miniatures.
This is you. Look at me. Do you see the problem?
I guarantee, you will be remembered as a great beauty.
Baby, baby, not so jocund; give Daddy that inscrutable smile one more time.
No, this does not make you look fat
I’m rated one of the top artists of the Pleistocene age.
No, future generations won't think you're fat. Everyone knows a cave wall adds 10 lbs.
This is your Facecave profile. No tusks. They make you seem unapproachable!
Hold still, dammit....
You have not put on any weight, stand still
That's not funny; do you want a tusk or don't you!
I don't know what to tell you - you need to lose a few thousand pounds...
I'd like to see you try to get detail in this light
My wife wishes I would stop painting nudes.
No, I did not make your nose too big.
I think you're making me look fat.
Trust me, the President is wrong:, size doesn't matter.
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
I said, don't look!
I don’t need a critic !
What? Now you're an art critic?
Can't you remember that I told you not to move?
Primitive?
I'm the only portraitist on this side of the glacier. This IS your best angle.
What? You want fifty shades of gray?
For your next lesson, we'll work on tusks.
We also do cards, calendars, and collages.
Me call it "Drawing by Thag, Contest #1, May 12, 7432 BC"
Can you give me a little less tooth in that smile?
So now, everybody's a critic.
I told you already...the life-size version would take way too long!
Any thoughts on a winning caption ?
I'm not going to get this right unless you stay still.
Take it from me that is your "good side".
Finally - someone is talking about the Elephant in the room.
No. I don't sleep with all my models.
I can't work while you're watching!
You know, you really look good by firelight
Just this once, how 'bout a smile?
I'm losing light, stop moving.
No, this is not where little elephants come from.
Don't worry, I'll have Grog fix it in post.
Draw me like one of your French Mastadons.
Thus, the mammoth differs greatly from the mastadon.
Now let's build some happy little trees . . .
I'm hoping some classy art will attract some women to the cave.
You didn't paint my good side!
Fred's life drawing classes were a mammoth disappointment.
You can't handle the tooth!!!
Don't rush me...I do the tusks at the end.
If you don't stop fidgeting, I'll just find me a bison who can.
I'm not going to argue! In the west, it's trunk UP for luck!
I'm trying out this new "Paleolithic" style
It’s representational
If I want to draw you wooly, then I will draw you wooly!
I couldn't find a milk carton. This is the best shot we have of finding him.
Ok....keep your mysterious smile just like that!
MARSHMALLOWS? Never heard of them.
Models are always forgotten. The artist and his work live forever.
No, I can't make you look skinny.
I didn’t want the focus to be on your trunktile disfunction.
I know, but I only have so much grey paint.
I have no idea but they'll write books about it.
look, you wanted this
I left out your tusks. They'll never be worth anything.
Don't blame the artist. You're the one putting all that junk in your trunk.
Now give me angry. A little more Jumbo, a little less Dumbo.
I know your working for peanuts, but can't you just hold the pose for five more minutes.
What part of “Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise!” don’t you understand?
Don't be ridiculous. The fire light does not make you look fat.
You asked me to make you look thinner.
Yeah it's another caveman cartoon, you got a problem with that?
It's called primitivism, but I find that insulting.
If you think your kid could do it better, why hasn't he done it?
How do you expect me to get it right if you won't hold still?
I tried one of those correspondence courses, but I’m mostly self-taught.
Relax. I'm sure they know about shrinkage in the future too.
Forget the wheel, I needs someone to invent a bowl of fruit.
It'll be a mammoth artistic achievement.
I'm just trying to think of a caption.
Are you sure you don’t want a robe or something?
There's a song that goes with it, "Wooly Bully."
If you never forget, then what's the point?
Elephants may never forget, but men do!
I'd appreciate it if you would show up on time. I'd like to get this finished before the Ice Age.
I won't always be around to sign your name, you know
What? I’m an impressionist not a realist.
No I did not make you look fat, you are fat!
Hey! How about one of you and your friends playing cards?
You're paying for this in ivory, right?
OK, OK don't rush me, it's hard to work in charcoal, but in 30,000 years you'll be famous, believe me.
You are are actually much thinner, the ice adds 10 tons
Just a little bit longer, then we'll go relax in the tar pits!
It's like looking in a mirror, right?
I know that it’s not to scale! I only have a chisel- what do you expect?
Hold still, I'm trying to get the light on your trunk just right.
Listen, I don’t care if you think your tusks are too small. You’re paying me peanuts!
Relax...this will have no historical significance.
Look, I know it doesn’t look like you. But the guy who hired me just wants something that will last.
Yes, I pay you peanuts, but you'll have exposure for millennia to come.
Stop moving, I don't want you to come out like a fuzzy mammoth.
and that’s where babies come from. Questions?
I wanna get it just right. You'll be extinct soon.
Hold still! How do you expect me to capture your essence if you can't hold still?!
So, you're sure you want to go through with the nose job?
This is when you were a baby, remember?
Now's a fine time to tell me your right side is the better profile.
Mr. Mastadon, I said your descendants would be African Elephants, not "A Frickin' Elephant!"
Had you exercised more and ate sensible meals, you wouldn't be worried about my vision.
Who made you a critic?
Don't worry, it's not to scale.
Stay limp like that and you'll go down in history as the party of inaction!
I can't hold this much longer my trunk is burning.
It’s not as big as you think it is
I know you have a good memory but I still think you should take notes.
Sorry, the paintbrush adds ten pounds.
Could you give me a smile that's a little less toothy, please.
Trumpet to right if like. Trumpet left, Og draw new elephant.
Would you please hold still--you're the LAST ONE.
It's supposed to look amateurish.
Want to enter my caption competition?
I didn't bring you in here to judge my art skills, Paul.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer
Tomorrow can you bring your daughter and the pitchfork?
Well, if you remember it so clearly, YOU draw it!
Have I got the trunk right? Is this a reasonable likeness of the elephant that took your cabbages?
Hold still and stop leaning to the right.
You of all people should remember my password!
Stop smirking, just because you're evolved doesn't make you special.
Will you try to look a little more natural?
Find the hidden animals in this picture.
I tell you straight, leaving out the tusks will make your life much easier.
Out! Out! It's not finished yet!
Freeze will ya?
Let's do without the enigmatic smile, shall we?
I am not objectifying you. This is in case, you go extinct...
No, I am not going to draw you with a saber-tooth tiger in your mouth.
No! I can't make you look younger and thinner.
I did not exaggerate the size of your nose!
Just remember -- I'm only doing portraits until the Bronze Age kicks in.
Just model for their logo, and don't mention you voted for Bernie.
Hold still will ya?! The wife wants this finished before her parents arrive.
Say, trees.
Some day, we both may be extinct.
Don't worry, Shep, by the time I'm finished, you're be the Mona Lisa of woolies.
No, I will not give you blue eyes.
Burning Man is terrible this year
Can you make my tusks look longer?
Try to look a little more menacing.
After you’re extinct, I’ll be famous.
Just letting the wife know we are off to hunt and gather.
Let's try a different expression. Imagine that you've just this second learned of the ivory trade.
Perhaps we should have addressed that elephant in the room, sooner.
Don't take this personally, but do you know your right tusk is longer than your left tusk?
In 25,000 years, people will think you were a fertility god.
You should know that I also love you for your mind.
This is for my kids, I thought your friend the big bird was coming?
When someone invents the cell phone this will be a lot quicker.
Stop flinging peanuts Carl!
Smile, damn you!
See! You look so pretty when you smile.
It's an abstract.
It's for the trunk sale!
You know, you're not what I had in mind when I signed up for a life drawing class!
Are you also available for the hunting scene tomorrow?
Don't worry, I'll get your good side.
For the last time, I'm not pulling your trunk.
I promise you no one is going to remember this
In an effort to confuse ivory poachers, early cave painters began painting elephants without their tusks.
You should be thankful I've immortalized you in stone, especially considering my plans for this afternoon with my hunting party.
Tusk, tusk. I'm almost done.
Stop moving your ears!
A little to the left, now hold it.
Out. This is my equine period.
You know it's bad luck to let your trunk down.
Have you ever posed clothed?
Well, sorry, but the paintbrush always adds a couple of pounds.
Maybe you can’t forget, but i can!
I'll do your right side next.
If we call it ‘primitive’ they won’t know I can’t draw
Don't blink
I'm sorry, did I draw your nose too long?
Hold still. It's your chance for 15 thousand years of Fame.
You are safe here until they invent the piano.
I paint what I see, you ARE mammoth.
Because those tusks make you look fat!
For posterity,so you'll always be in the room.
It’s hard to say, I told you he was wearing a mask.
Hold still! Man just learned to do this.
Which did you say is your better side?
That's all for now. I'll fill in the hunters and spears later.
No, it's not exact! It's post-impressionist!
Did your attacker have any facial hair?
No. The drawing doesn't add 10 lbs.
Just a tad more to the left...
Yes. It's a new thing, called posting to a wall.
You don't want your legacy to be a limp trunk, do you?
Thanks for shaving. It brings out your thick skin.
I prefer the Tuskan look.
No, we can’t name everyplace Tuscaloosa!!
You don’t have a best side
Could you show me a bit more tusk, please?
Yes, paint by numbers would make it easier. No, I haven't invented them yet.
Oh, Jeez. I told you the bathroom was right outside.
You already asked me that yesterday, and I told you we haven't figured out yet how to make purple.
What, another walk? Why don't you just use the litter box?
I have no idea what "intellectual property" means!
Stay frozen just like that...this might take me an eon.
For Oook's sake, stand still!
Oh really, I drew the trunk too big? You knew I was a caricaturist when you met me, Patricia.
I hate painting pets, but it pays the rent.
Now lick your lips for me.
The wall takes away 10,000 pounds.
Because the painting adds ten pounds.
This is how you'll look after the face lift.
Stop moving, damn it!
“Give me a break! It’s my first time sketching a nude model”.
Don't worry---I can photoshop out your wrinkles.
OK so I'm not Leonardo, but you're no Mona Lisa
Can you take a quarter turn to the right so that I can see all of those beautiful tusks?
Could you please lean a little less to the right?
I'll let you take credit for fire, if you give me painting. Deal?
If you're going to criticize, you can go live in another cave.
Give me a Mona Lisa smile. You know, enigmatic.
Because your inner child doesn't have tusks!
This is the best I can do. Hunting is my talent.
In about ten thousand years I'll be compared to Jackson Pollock. And you?
Emphasizing the ivory is probably a big mistake
hold still. I'm almost done.
Hey, this is a cave. It's supposed to look like a primitive painting!
I'm sorry, I can only hold it up for so long!
If we take a little off the tusk, it will offer a much more youthful look.
I love how the light captures your trunk.
Yes, I got your good side!
No, my friend, I'm leaving the tusks out so you don't look too horny....
You have to face it, you have a big nose.
I want "Raging Bull" -- not "Little Women"!
Trunk up a little, please.
I'm calling it "Ella font."
Hold still, or I’ll make you look hairy!
Neanderthal jokes are so early Holocene. Think of something else.
I'm entering my prehistoric phase.
Give me a smile now! The ice age is over.
I'm posting this on my wall for "Throwback Thursday."
Caves always make you look fatter.
Please! The peanut breath is killing me!
Just a little more to the left. Perfect!
Relax, this isn't my first cave drawing.
No, really, thanks for posing! I mean, what with hunting and all...
Hold still. This won’t last long.
No, I don’t think this cave painting makes you look fat.
No, those tusks don't make you look fat.
'You look very stiff, can you do something wild and spontaneous?"
Your legs are supposed to look stumpy. It's a caricature.
What? You're not funding National Endowment For the Arts!
I know, I know, I won't forget the horns!
You are not fat. The wall always adds 10 pounds.
Yes, I know what having long tusks really means.
Trust me...the tusks add 50 pounds.
God, you're beautiful!
When I'm through with this you are going to be a celeb.
Just be happy someone's paying attention to you for once.
Trust me. No one will know how horny you really were.
Can you make me look younger?
These days, without social media presence you might as well be extinct.
Mark my words, someday other cave people come here and grunt out loud - "Grog good artist, truly original, ahead of time."
I'm sorry, but if I don't draw you with a spear in your side, everyone's going to think I'm a wimp!
You’re big and stinky, yet I gave you a home, fire, and art; and you’re leaving ME ??
Well what else was I supposed to do with a Liberal Arts degree?
I don’t love it either. But maybe future generations will.
Done. if you want wallet size, that's gonna cost extra.
Stand still, or I'll really chase you with a spear.
No, it does not make your butt look fat.
I am NOT trying to belittle you.
Can't you stand still for 10 minutes? I can make you famous in 30,000 years!
I'm an impressionist! I CAN'T painter you thinner!
I don't care how much you adore your woolly coat...I paint nudes...end of story!
I don’t know what to tell you, it adds ten pounds.
One day your grandchildren will really apprec- oh wait, never mind.
This is the composite based on eyewitness accounts. Are you saying you've never seen the perp?
What happened to that "I've got a secret" smile of yours?
Of course you’re not that big - you know the cave adds ten pounds.
I can draw a female next to you later big guy.
Listen, this doesn’t feel ethical. If you’re that attracted to her then go talk to her; otherwise, finish it yourself. And to be clear, I’m talking about the painting not your other trunk.
Finally, the New Yorker ran out of cartoons!
Move your head just a little to the right. The tusks are giving me trouble.
Hold still, you'll be extinct one day and I need to capture this!
Doing a nude would be a lot more fun but I can't get anyone to sit for me.
No, I will not draw you a bigger one..
Turn a bit more...to the left please.
I don’t do tusks.
Of course I'll draw you to scale when I move into my big cave.
OK, now hold still for a couple of hours.
Maybe you never forget, but I need something to help me remember.
Well you're the one who cut the NEA budget.
I'm sorry you think the nose looks big, but lets be honest . . .
'Don't worry, I'll put some leaves and flowers in the background to soften you up.'
I promise, it's flattering.
What do you mean "Walt is doing this in colour"?
What the **** you lookin' at Ski Nose?
More trunk less junk please.
Well, I think *you* need to work on accepting yourself.
If you tilt your head a bit and lift your right eyebrow it would show your wry sense of humor.
Look, the least you can do is keep your trunk up!
For the tenth time, no, your tusks don't make you look fat.
If anyone's interested, where can they reach you?
What do you mean “it’s a bit wooly”?!
I get it, but it is the best I can do with this outdated lighting.
Okay, now lie on your side and give me a strong, masculine expression.
No you can’t take it home when I’m done.
Naive? Sure, But with a touch of Neolithic whimsy, don't you think?
Stop blinking!!
No, it’s the Delux Package that includes color.
Stand still, or you're gonna be extinct a lot sooner than you expect.
I told you all I do are nudes.
Don't move!! You think this is easy? You think I'm doing this for a lark?
You blinked. I'll have to start over.
YES, this again... it's how we get the good commissions in the bigger caves.
Trunk down? Really?? You'll regret this in the holocene.
Sure, I love the mystic smile and all. But my palette is kinda limited here, so work with me!
Don't give me that look.. I took off 10,000 pounds and left out the wrinkles like you asked!
What do you mean, I truncated your tusk?
For an extra ten spot Mr. Trunk, I can make your tusks a lot more...you know..."manly"
No, you don't need a nose job.
I told you to lay off the bulking powder until we were done.
You were right charcoal does work, but I don't see it becoming popular with artists.
Hold still. I’m trying to get your good side.
I like to think of myself as a pre-Impressionist.
I'm almost to the part where I add the spear. I'm going to need you to hold really still.
Okay, okay. I'll draw your tusks larger.
Let's have a little more tusk
Do you remember what the asteroid looked like?
Keep your trunk up, please.
Of course, Mr Trunk. A lush cover of woolly hair. I was just about to paint it on.
Feel like a ride, after?
Well, it’s not supposed to look EXACTLY like you, it’s an ABSTRACT cave-wall painting.
First I discovered fire, then the wheel... I'm calling this one-"Pictionary" !
What do ya mean, what's cheese?
Yes, I can make you look thinner.
I'm capturing your playful spirit NOT your exact image.
"Harvey, I'm audioning for the part of the Wooley Mammoth. Why am I naked again?".
Yes, of course I know the difference between a wooly mammoth and a mastodon.
I'm capturing your inner child.
I'm looking to go beyond representational to early existential in this scene.
Okay, wise guy, you want someone to capture your “essence,” go two caves over and talk to Pierre.
Don’t be so critical. You’ll never understand modern art.
Trust me this is your good side, and plus who's gonna see it?
Okay, now where do you want the spear?
If you buy the deluxe family package, I can include pictures of all your relatives, but only if you act today.
Don't you dare!
Move a little to the right.
Ok, you're done. Send in the sabre tooth.
Now hold that expression for a long, long time.
Don't move, I want to capture your better side.
I know your trunk doesn't look like this, but it's an ad for Viagra
History's first plastic surgery consultation.
Do you think you can remember to stand still?
I’m immortalizing you-you can scratch your nose when I’m finished!
What did you do with the horse?
I'd like to see you do better
The lighting still seems off.
Now don't forget this
try to look a little happier
You can't expect a mammoth depiction.
No one will ever say 'Let's talk about the mammut americanum in the room' if you make it that small.
It’s not you. The wall adds 15 lbs.
For the last time, no. Those tusks do not make you look fat.
Could you turn to the left please?
No, you don't look fat in those tusks.
Cover your right eye and read the second line.
Show me some passion, you precious pachyderm.
Yes, anyone could have carved this, but I did it first.
You have an ephemeral quality that I am trying to capture.
This art won't last? Look who's talking.
Smile, you will become known as the Mammolisa!
This is not just graffiti but a real work of art that will live down through the ages.
I am going to call it Minimalism.
Look dignified. And remember, this is for posterity.
No, you cannot choose your color.
But this IS how I painted the French girls.
Does this jog your memory?
You know, the other tourists just took a few photos.
I think I captured your sweet disposition.
This is you when you were just a wee baby.
Give me your best 17,000 years from now look.
The cave adds 10 lbs
You're only as big as you're seen.
So what are you doing later?
You and your "too subjective"!
OK it's slow and no props- so go find another photo booth.
Don't worry, I have Photoshop.
I know you guys are bigger than this, but I'm tired.
I'll bet those guys in Lascaux never thought of this!
Are my ears to scale?
No, you're not fat in real life. People say the cave adds a few hundred pounds.
Stop complaining! Strict representationalism is so paleolithic.
Hold it right there. I want to convey that vulnerability.
I'm blogging about how you cornered me in here.
You don't have a 'good' side!
Don't move. I'm almost done.
C'mon. give us a little smile.
No , I can't get you a copy.
Smile, please. That's it. Now hold it!
If you can’t stand still, it’ll be blurry.
What? The charcoal adds twenty pounds.
Oh relax, the cave adds a thousand pounds.
No, I married you for you sense of humor!
It's not supposed to look like you.
It's called, "Elephants Playing Poker." I need six more models.
Don't worry, the pick and hammer add ten pounds.
You shouldn't have shaved.
I’m waiting for the light to be just right!
Sorry, there is no "good side" with this prehistoric lighting.
You pay peanuts, you get primitive.
I'd like to get your best side.
Good. Now can you show me "fierce?"
Image will be everything, especially after you go extinct.
You know what they say, the cave wall adds 10 pounds.
Do you want me to make it look bigger?
Wait until I finish this painting before you and your girlfriend trot over to Noah's place.
I can't swipe right. It's a _cave_ drawing.
Give me a break! It's not a photograph! It's a prehistoric cave painting!
Do you want me to make you look thinner?
Consider this drawing a hedge against extinction.
Well excuuuuuse me, this is the best I can do with charcoal and fire.
Look, when you learn to draw you can put me in any pose you want.
You're not the GOP, you're just the Elephant in the room
I'm almost done, but you can't leave. I hear those Trump kids are still here.
Yeah....., well you're no Kate Moss yourself.
C'mon. Give me a smile.
Let's hurry this up. I've got a donkey coming in at 1:00.
It's a younger picture of you in your pre-ivory days.
We can make the trunk smaller and deal with those wrinkly ankles in post-etching.
You're fine - everyone knows the cave adds ten pounds.
Don't worry, I'll paint a pebble for scale.
And I'm telling you, this will outlive us both!
Stop kvetching, I'm almost finished
'Say cheese' doesn't happen for another 35,000 years.
Great moments in paleophthalmology: The first eye chart.
This IS your skinnier side!
Can you please try to show a little less tooth?
Don't forget our deal...I do your wall, you get me one of those fire things for my cave.
Keep it up! I thought you guys never forgot anything.
With or without wrinkles?
Tusk Tusk. Everybody's an art critic.
"Lower your tusk and don't blink".
If you had sat still, I would have been finished 20 years ago........
You should know I'm doing this for peanuts.
What do you mean, I make you look fat?
What do you mean that my painting makes you look fat?
You are the perfect symbol for my new, modern political party.
Will you sit still already and stop it with ????Smoke Gets in Your Eyes????
You know I can't do this if you keep evolving like that!
More enigmatic. I'm going for the Mona Lisa smile...
Wow, the ochre really does add ten pounds
“Trunk for President “ The world’s first meme
Do you think I got your nose right?
Even if too small, I'm going to make You immortal, my Friend.
Come on now! Don't just stand there! You're a pro! Show some personality! Smile!
Your baby is fine. I’m afraid, though, that this will have to do until someone invents ultrasound.
...and don't forget to brush in 'Don't Panic' in cherry red...it'll be there for millions of years
What do you mean it doesn't even look like you?
Look, the GOP is what it is.
How about a little smile?
Don't worry, I'll make sure I get your good side.
Laws protecting your likeness haven't been invented yet.
Well then, what would you like to be called?
Chin down, no no no too much.
When I said I did "mammoth portraits," I wasn't referring to the size.
TRY CROSSING YOUR LEGS!
Let me see that smile again
So, uh... which way do you swing?
Try looking a little animated for a change!
I'm doing the best I can! You think anyone's ever going to see this?
This is how the baby would look in an ultrasound.
Maybe it's not a perfect likeness, but in a million years it's going to be the talk of the town.
When you were only this big, I could clean up after you…
Who’s the artist here?
Stop complaining. It doesn't have to be a good likeness if it captures your spirit.
Don't fidget!
It’s not you! Cave painting always adds fifteen pounds.
Can you please turn sideways again?
Could you try to look a little more terrifying?
Has anyone ever told you you have the most exquisite cheekbones?
do you want me to rub out the wrinkles?
Not impressed? I anticipating that cave art will hold its value.
Don’t worry about it! Everyone knows the cave fire adds 10 lbs.
Can you just hold still for another minute? I want my wife to know what ate me.
That pose, only bigger!
Ancient Times. 30,000 BS (Before Selfie)
I don't care what other artist and their models get up to, I'm not that kind of guy.
I'm immortalizing you, but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for your species.
Okay, take a break, but don't go off and get extinct.
I can draw the tusks as short as I want. It's called "artistic license."
Don't complain about my drawing! Even Rousseau had to start someplace.
Keep still, we're making pre-history.
Really? And just who do you think will care that you're naked?
No, I don't think you look fat.
I thought this was your best side?
It’s my truth.
What do you mean "sign a release"?
She's just a friend... and stop going through my cave paintings.
If that’s what I look like, I may as well not exist...
You're a much better subject than my last one. I couldn't get the hyena to shut up.
I'm tellin' ya, lose the tusks for your own good.
NO, not even former Presidents get to negotiate ears!
No I won't give it wings. What do you thing this is, fake views?
Sorry about the nose. I paint what I see.
The only time I feel alive is when I’m painting.
Tilt your chin a little to the right.
Someday, they will call my work “Impressionism.”
3000 B.C and I’m still drawing on a cave...
Can you hold that enigmatic smile?
It's not a selfie unless you're holding the brush.
Think you can do any better?
But a life-size painting would be just mammoth
This drawing will be on the milk cartons delivered to all the caves. Don't worry. We will find her soon.
Sorry, this light makes your ass look big.
You call that full length?
No, honestly, you don't have a bad side.
Try not to look so Babaric.
Whaddya mean, you think I made your trunk too short? I didn’t get this kinda crap from the donkey!
Give it time, it'll grow on you.
You’re only Old Stone Age if you think of yourself as Old Stone Age.
It doesn't look anything like you because it's NOT you!
It know it’s a bit meta, but I’m working on my caption contest entry.
Can you do another one? I think I blinked.
Look...you're gonna' have to stay still. I haven't invented an eraser yet.
Sorry but elephants are strictly yesterday. Minimal is hot now.
Ok, I'll make your ears smaller. But I insist on the lush green foliage for the background.
Try looking more like a wild animal and less like a cave pet facing extinction.
I'd rather be ignored.
StopStaringatMe
Just a little bit longer, Mr. President.
Work it Margeaux, sexy...SEXY! Now ANGRY... Oh wait...
You'll gain a much better perspective during Renaissance, trust me.
Why can't you stand still?
It's my wall and I'll paint what I want.
Don't worry, we can clean up those wrinkles in post.
You like it, Masta Don?
You always look younger in pictures
Okay, next, did you see whether the perp's tusks were straight or curved.
You knew I was a Fauvist when you agreed to pose.
we haven't invented mirrors yet, this is what you look like.
No you can't. Cave carvings come later.
Hold that smile and turn slightly to the left.
I think I’m really entering my Pleistocene Period.
Not to worry! I’ll note the scale as 1:1000.
Ceci n'est pas un mammouth.
What do you mean "woollier"?
I'll name you Elephant. Hopefully the name sticks.
Stop whining! You mastodons are a dime a dozen!
Hey--you're a model. Models don't tell painters how to paint!
Stand proud, some day your ancestors will be the symbol for the Republican Party.
Hey - trunks are really hard to draw!
The artist’s use of tar proved to be an eerie foreshadowing of his subject’s fate.
OK, you'll have to give us more time if you want a Picasso.
So.... Is that supposed to be a smile?
Before your first date, there's a few things you need to know.
Can you quit farting? It's breaking my concentration.
If you don't want to stand there all day, stop dropping your trunk .
I thought that WAS your good side.
Could you turn a bit to the left, please?
I didn't draw your nose too long. It looks fine
You're the sixth applicant for the proverbial 'elephant in the room'. The last one wasn't big enough.
You are my study in brown.
no expression, please.
I can never keep up! Do I swipe left or right if you like her?
No, your not fat! The cave wall adds about 10 pounds.
Yes, I realize they're bigger--this is called artistic license.
$20 only covers you, drawing your family will cost more
If you don't quit moving, your going to look 500 pounds heavier.
Lifting your trunk makes it more of an action shot.
And then I’m going to have anyone who sees it submit their own caption!
It's that way because I'm the artist and I see you nude.
Ok which way do you want it? Up or down?
Wait until it dry's, it will look more like you then
We may be ahead of our time, darling, but voluptuous models will be all the rage by the mid-1600s.
Could you turn sideways again? We haven't invented perspective yet.
No, I don't think you look fat.
Can you show a little less tusk when you smile?
You moved! Trunk up!
If you can hold it for just another five minutes, believe me, you will be immortal.
Get over it Sourpuss. Haven't you ever heard of artistic license?
And here you are at a prepubescent prehistoric age.
Well, if you'd come over here I coould trace you and get it right.
Sorry, shading and texture aren't invented yet.
Can you turn to your left, please? We haven't invented perspective yet.
One more move and I'll replace you with an antelope.
Try stampeding! Anthropologist like action!
It's the elephant in the room.
Your dad should have explained this to you, but that's what you get living in a matriarchy.
Can I have a bit more facing-extinction pathos?
I can add “not draw to scale.”
Oh, I love it - you're really capturing the essence of who I am.
The light makes you look fat because you ARE fat!
I just want to show that you were really in the cave with me.
Can you hang around? I want to make an ivory sculpture next.
Who knows? Maybe some day my art will be discovered.
It’s not the light! I only have one shade of grey!
Turn sideways...I only do profiles.
Let's see that mysterious smile.
I know you're a mastodon. I couldn't afford the elephant.
Of course you look fat. They haven't invented perspective yet.
After your trunk-tuck, I recommend fixing those buckteeth before dating again.
How do you spell YUGE?
"Yeah, her trunk's a little crooked, but I really think you're going to have just get out there at some point if you really want to meet someone...".
I swear, it’s not a grocery list.
Come on now, show me those big brown eyes.
This cave art will prove evolution is not irrelephant to future generations.
Be patient...I'm trying to capture your inner self...... Someday you'll be famous...
On my diet plan, you can look like this in 30 days!!
No, the cave wall does NOT add ten pounds!
You are not allowed to smile for the passport picture
How’s this for your profile pic?
Ok now you do me
Her name is Elsa.
Yes, I've captured your good side.
Tusks? Don't worry. I can Photoshop those in later.
No, I won't forget your splendid tusks!
I can't capture your essence if you keep swinging your trunk.
I know the limbs aren't long enough, but who's gonna be around to make that judgement.
This drawing will be enormous, no gigantic, no colossal...hmmm, no MAMMOTH!
No, I will not exaggerate your trunk size.
No, I will not make your nose "more perky".
A little more to the left. Yes. Yes. That's good.
This baby is gonna go right through the roof when you go extinct.
Of course it's smaller than you. I'm an impressionist not a realist.
How am I supposed to draw you if you keep evolving?
If you don't like it, you draw it.
The Physical Impossibilty of Death in the Mind of Someone Living
Don't move, Mona Lisa. I need this to be realistic-looking.
Picasso's paleolithic-period
That's right. Sell it! Great. I've got your best side. Oooooo, nice. OK! Now, who's the biggest star? Yes. Give me the look. That's IT!!!! Beautiful.
Hey, it's not bad for never having taken an art class.
Ok, for this I'll photoshop them out, but you're still need to see an Orthodontist.....
No, it doesn’t make you look like you have too much junk in your trunk!
Trust me, you'll be famous in 2018!
No, I'm not going to make you look like a woolly mammoth.
Stop evolving!
Is this your first time posing nude?
Talk about working for peanuts, try being an artist in this day and age.
Your trunk was up in yesterday's pose. Don't you remember?
"Quit smiling", this is serious.
I'm not paying for that
You don't have to be Mona Lisa to put on a smile on your face, okay?
Whaddaya mean, the color's not right? Nobody's gonna care 10,000 years from now.
'Oh come ON! You drew a CIRCLE and I correctly guessed it was a rock...THIS IS SO EASY!'
You're right, I should have taken those art classes.
Are you almost finished? I couldn't hold my trunk up any longer.
Draw my hands extra large
To be realistic it should droop, don't your think?
Yes it DOES look like you.
Get over it! In 30 or 40,000 years no one will be wearing long tusks.
Swipe left? Really?
OK, OK, I'll draw you next.
See, by making you smaller, it makes you look like you're farther away.
His ears were bigger?
I'm an artist. I'm not going to paint you to look thinner.
Quit complaining! Size does not matter.
A little to the left...
You can only be immortal if you hold the pose.
Okay...you are here, and home is here. If you get lost, just follow the other elephants!
So, should we take some artistic license with the nose?
If you're lucky, maybe someday Mick Stevens will put you in a 'New Yorker' cartoon.
Could you turn your tusks just a little to the left.
Oh, NOW you want your tusks bigger?
I told you a hundred times, I already made the other one blue. So, just go hold still. Besides...thousands of years from now is anyone really going to care about color?
Yeah, I know. The Rhino said he was too small, too!
Nobody likes a critic.
Stand still, you only have a few thousand years left.
Try and hold that enigmatic smile.
Hold still! I have to finish this before you go extinct
The wall does NOT add 100 pounds!
You want me to start again....what do you mean this is your bad side.
What did you expect? You're paying me peanuts!
Relax, I add the spears later.
I don't care what you say, I not removing any more wrinkles!
Could you raise your trunk and try to smile?
So let's call it a draw then.
Early National Geographic Photojournalist.
So now, everybody's a critic.
Yeah, safe to say Picasso didn’t live in a cave. At least give me tusks.
No, your butt doesn't look big in this drawing!
I know you're tired, but if you don't keep your trunk up you'll ruin this pictograph.
Do I have to chisel it again or are you going to remember?
Just enjoy the fire and hold still, or I'll send you back out into the Ice Age.
Hold still a little longer, before we lose the light.
Don't worry...I won't make you look prehistoric
Now say, AAARRRRHHHH!!!!
I'm done with animals. I think I'm going to start a hands period.
what hashtag would you like me to use?
Basically, the new Pennsylvania congressional map will look like this.
A little less tooth in the smile please.
Some of your cousins have big beautiful ears, I'll do my best with what you've got.
It's not my fault. You moved.
Hey, it's not my fault your nose looks big!
Don't give me that "elephants never forget" bullshit, I've told you 10 TIMES not to look until I'm finished.
OK, OK, I'll make your nose smaller.
It's not a midget elephant! It's a small elephant.
I don't care if you have to go to the bathroom.
Look fierce, I am trying to paint us engaged in mortal combat.
Can you paint me 10lbs lighter?
If you want a "subtle rosy glow" I'll need something other than paint made from blood, clay and urine.
Don't sulk. It's called artistic license.
Picture worth ten words, ugh
Do you have a caption?
I took some liberties with your trunk on your behalf.
Draw me like one of your elephant girls.
Don’t quit on me now. We have 500 more caves to go and you’re the only thing I can draw.
I need your trunk back up.
You know, I was young myself once.
Hmmm. A little nip. A little tusk. And I'll launch the theory of evolution.
Stay still! I need the fire to stay warm!
No, muses don't take breaks for mud baths!
In future, you be great emblem of party of cavemen.
Would you stop moving!
The talent agent tells me it's your first nude gig.
And I'm not going any higher for the life-story rights!
Say, trees.
There, the world's first documented idiom.
I captured your good tusk.
You have to use the bathroom again?
Settle down. This is a baby picture.
Well excuuuse me for not going to art school.
Rock the art world? Not in a million years.
I don't care if you're feeling happy, stop smiling!
Now remember, this isn't to scale.
Do you want me to spear you before or after I paint it on the wall?
Relax, I am just trying to warn burglars!
Gesundheit!
I'm going to make you famous, damn it! Can't you hold that trunk up for another ten lousy minutes?
Be patient, Babar, my work will evolve.
I guess this where the "elephant in the room" comes from
Yeah, well, it might look like a pig to you, but in 20,000 years primitive art will be considered nonpareil.
Ok, now a funny one.
No, I did not make you look fat.
NOTE: this isn't a caption. What happened to the cartoon from this week? The one with the hiker at the mountaintop cafe? It's 11:50pm and it's gone. Don't we have until midnight to submit?
No, I will not compromise my artistic integrity. The fat and wrinkles stay.
Stop smiling, you're supposed to look like you're running for your life!
I already photoshopped enough for you to attract a bull. I shrunk your schnoz and tusks, and knocked off around 300 pounds. If I change any more, you will look like a horse.
My next invention is fake news.
Don't be such a primastadonna; no one is going to care if you look fat!
Think of it as a measure of immortality long after we're extinct.
Experts say you will potentially evolve into this creature.
Try to look more like an extinct mammoth, and I'll add some mastodon overtones.
So I've added the pointy trunk. Were there any other unique characteristics the mugger had that you remember?
"Keep it up with the snarky comments and they'll find you in the permafrost, some day"!
Which side IS your good side?
Forgive me, I am bit nervous. I have never done a nude before.
Give me a big, tusky grin.
What? Humanity won't appreciate my art until after I'm dead?
More profile, please.
Can you smile more enigmatically?
I prefer my right side.
Just because you were a Lascaux model doesn’t make you an expert on which is your good side!
This is for posterity so try to look sincere!
Hold still. I need to get this done before you go extinct.
I know this is taking a long time. I want to get this right before you are extinct.
You think you can do better?
Of course, keep in mind that in this light colors appear more subdued
Yes, you're my model but not my muse, yet.
Do you want her to wear pearls?
Can you move a little to the right, and maybe hold up one foot?
She just left 5 minutes ago. If you hurry, you'll catch her.
I call it 'Why is there an elephant in my cave?'
In a few million years this might be worth a fortune.
I told that agency that I wanted a mastodon!
You'll look much younger in 10,000 years
No, it's not just a generic mastodon, it's you!
Hold still or 10,000 years from now they'll think you're a space alien.
If you’re so good why don’t you draw it?
No, I am not making you look fat! Don't be such a masto-donna.
Don't worry, they'll be tasteful.
No...It hasn't been done before.
It’s not my fault! I told you the wall adds 1500 pounds.
Smile ! You'll be the elephant in the cave nobody wants to talk about.....
It's a carnicature - it's supposed to be grotesque.
What do you mean, “It makes me look fat”?
She never mentioned she was married.
You moved.
Look, I'm running out of charcoal as it is.
I already said, “ hold still can’t you remember?”
Typical guy--I think I drew it quite long enough.
Look, you're in the room but I don't want to talk about it.
These days, portrait art pays peanuts.
No No 'paint night' is tomorrow
Don't look at me like that... the chisel adds 10 pounds!
Was the mugger wearing a hoodie?
they say a wall subtracts 1000 pounds
Someday National Geographic will thank us.
Don’t fall asleep again. We going for wild, mean and scary.
I know, I know, but the brush adds on ten pounds.
...and you last saw her yesterday?
Where did you get those mammoth tusks?
His patron was a harsh critic. Moments later Thak was trampled to death.
You'll be remembered for eternity. Now, hold still!
You can put your robe back on.
Crude is my aesthetic.
What are you trumpeting about, I did capture your good side.
Don't you remember? I told you I'm in my minimalism phase.
Consider, too, that a cave drawing will add ten pounds to your apparent weight.
What do you mean that’s not your good side?!
And then what happened...?
You don't look anything like your profile pic!
Hold still I just need to add the horns
Stop complaining. How do you know what you looked like as a little boy.
Now remember where I drew this, please!
Just forget about the red I used in last portrait!
Alright I promise. No stick figures and spears this time!
It's not primitive, Manny, it's art!
I've been posting signs all over the neighborhood about my lost elephant.
Stop smiling
Try not to evolve, please.
Hold still now- this is for posterity
Here is where I draw you NOT eating me.
Don't start tootin' back at me!!!!!
It's not supposed to look like you.
Now you can stop complaining about not getting enough attention
Oh, hush. If anything, I've made you look thinner!
And you said he had two what, tusks?
No. E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T. Not mammoth. Elephant.
You are not a duck, stop with the lips.
After this painting my starving artist days are over.
"You're my first nude".
But I AM drawing you like one of my french girls!
See what's going to happen to your tusks when you befriend those poachers!
It’s a series I’m calling ‘Zog Paint then Zog Eat.’
Truthfully, what I'd really like to do is direct."
Now, if you could just make that smile a bit more enigmatic, please.
PLEASE DON'T MOVE. YOU'RE THE ELEPHANT IN THE CAVE.
My style is post-prehistoricism
Enough with the critique! I'm still evolving as an artist.
Now, say we put the x+2y over the 5y-3x...
Quit your snorting. This is the art form of the future.
This will memorialize your species forever as 'Man's Best Friend.'
And that’s when Gerald realized...he was dating and elephant.
Nudes can be very tiring so I really appreciate your patience.
The wrong way to address the elephant in the room.
Oh, you didn't tell me you wanted to take this home to your place.
I know it's not life size and that your trunk looks short and is usually down, but that's what Impressionism is all about.
I'm calling this GOP (Grumpy Old Pachyderm)
You want it to "scale," you have to pay "scale."
Everyone's a critic. Just you wait, this'll make me famous one day.
This is not White House, you must be lost.
I am NOT making your nose look big.
I always have trouble painting tusks.
Listen, the horns make you look mean and almost prehistoric; this is much more friendly and cute.
ALL of us artists work for peanuts, when I am paid then you will get your share!
You think the nose should be bigger?
You call that pouty?
Yes, we will be here all day if you don't stop moving around.
Now I'll put happy little trees right here.
‘I’m thinking of calling it Primitive art’
It's my take on the elephant in the room.
It's a wallfie.
Ars longa, vita brevis.
I'm a manimalist."
Excuse me? The lighting is great and I am capturing your best side.
It's called: "After the Midterms."
I just invented rebranding. Try to act cute.
There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.
Be patient, Tina. I’m capturing your essence.
Apparently you've never heard of aesthetic license.
Just keep in mind, size isn't everything.
And you're no Mona Lisa.
Then everyone will want a break.
Yes, I am drawing your better side.
What do you mean “wheel”? You keep guessing that!
I'm not getting my security deposit back, am I?
Will you at least let me finish before you swipe left?
What do you mean that if I let the fire go out they will get bigger?
Of course it doesn't look just like you-this is modern art!
Once we trim those unfortunate teeth, we get this sleek, urban profile.
I know, I know. But keep in mind it's Impressionistic.
Oh yeah? Maybe YOU look like a warthog.
Hold still. I'm creating the proverbial elephant in the room.
This will have to do until someone invents digital cameras
You need to allow me some artistic freedom!
C'mon, realism is still ahead of us.
You get a mammoth painting when you pay the mammoth fee.
I told you before we started that this sitting would require some nudity.
Don't move a tusk.
Sorry but my art is certified ivory-free.
What? Your butt is still too big?
No! I can’t make you look skinnier!
You look fine...I told you the charcoal always adds ten pounds.
I give up. This has been a mammoth waste of time.
Be aware the wall adds ten pounds.
Look, you have to perk up. So forget about her, OK? Just forget about her!
No, it is NOT making your butt look fat.
Trust me. In two-million years, short tusks will be all the rage.
What a week--first Michelle and Barack and now you!
Relax! After I'm done no-one will ever forget about the elephant in the room.
This is just a prototype until we complete our BC funding round.
I'm hoping it goes viral.
Lest they forget.
Yes you look hot!
Biproboscidian? Tusk, tusk.
Okay, good, hold that pose - yes - now make the smile just a little more enigmatic, and I think we could have something for the ages
No, you can’t leave. I paid the agency for the whole day.
Okay, the guy who threw the spear, how big was his nose?
Make up your mind, Mona. Are you smiling or not?
Say Australopithecine and smile.
Fine, but this is the last damn time I'm painting you with 'duck face'.
I'll draw your damned tusks when I'm good and ready!
You look much better without your tusks.
Could you turn to the side? We won’t figure out foreshortening ‘til the Renaissance.
Just freeze for a second.
Wake up! This is an ad for fire. Can't you look a bit more frightened?
I'll try, but the brush adds about a thousand years.
I just thought the long trunk made you look fat.
Get some more wood on that fire, for God's sake! I'm losing the light.
Do you really expect me to spell stegotetrabelodon? How about we use "elephant" instead?
Everybody knows the cave wall adds a 100 pounds...
If I made your nose smaller it wouldn't be you!
Everyone seems to be avoiding drawing about the elephant in the cave.
I suppose you could do better?
Someday you'll be the talk of Lascaux.
No one will ever see, I promise.
Hey, don't be upset...cave paintings make everyone look 10 lbs heavier!
That's it! You got it! your beautiful! I love it!! Show me extinct!!!
The first step is to produce a reality TV show, then run for President.
Down the hall to the right.
Lifesize? No, its too much work.
Toughen up...baby pictures are NOT embarrassing!
The wall puts on ten pounds.
Whaddaya mean, "The nose ain't right?
Think about chocolate.
You're right, the firelight highlights the twinkle in your eye.
No animals were harmed in the making of this picture.
‘I know your Groupon say “boudoir session” but me told you I no have mammoth panties!’
Now give me a funny caption.
As your dentist, this is what I recommend.
I'm concerned that someone will invent ivory poaching.
Because it IS that wide.
Don’t be so sensitive. No one is gonna see my scribbles.
Oh for pete's sake, keep your trunk up.
I am NOT trying to seduce you!
You'll see. The wave of the future is miniaturization.
A hundred years from now, will anyone care about art?
I see you're ready for your close up.
How the elephant in the room started.
Don't give me that look, you're painting me next.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Cave walls add ten pounds.
OK, now you can move.
Thumbs do too make a difference!
This will make it look like you are farther away and much younger.
It looks EXACTLY like you.
What? You shot a human in your pajamas last night?
So, here's the deal. Today you're mammoth, but one day you're going to be huuuuge.
No, if I put wings on you it's going to freak people out.
It's caricature. Your nose is supposed to look bigger.
Posting pictures of what's for dinner on Cavewall is so cool.
No worries, I'll airbrush the wrinkles
Because I'm not good at tusks.
Yes, I realize the detail work on the tusks is not up to your standards. *You* try drawing with this stick, damn it!
Hold still, Dorian. I want to capture your youthful beauty.
This is religious art; quit being a critic.
I forget where we left off...you?
Trust me, your rump is mammoth---wooly, too.
“Take your time” is just a figure of speech.
Now pose! Yes! Just like that!
It’s done when I say it’s done.
Of course clothes off. It’s art.
Don't worry, they say the mural adds 10 pounds.
Of course this doesn't look like you. I'm a surrealist.
don't worry, it's not drawn to scale
Sorry. We're not doing portraits for another 38,000 years.
Tilt your head a 45% angle to the right. Oh good and a little extra light from the fire.
Smile, this one's for posterity.
Now, tilt your head to the right a little and tuck your chin slightly.
"I call it Cave Graphic Imaging, or just CGI for short".
I know it's really bad, but it will fetch a stellar price at auction once you go extinct.
You moved again! Now I have to start all over.
No, the cave lighting doesn’t make you look fat.
You can be as mammoth as you like, but I work on a small scale.
You'll never forget this.
I promise it's not tonight's menu
What do you mean - 'Draw me like one of your French girls'?
My question was addressed to Alexa, not you.
Draw me like one of your Lascaux Cave girls
I don’t know why you are so upset, everyone parietalshops their models these days.
Girl, you thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.
I'm doing my best. But the cave adds 20,000 pounds.
You would be extinct before I could finish a lifesize picture.
I promise you that selfies are going to be a thing.
Draw me like one of those Pliocene girls
Sorry, we don't take walk-ins.
Not so fast with the primitive, I’m an early realist.
Get that snide smirk off your face -- who do you think you are, Mona Lisa?
Ivory goes or I do.
I'm going to make them larger than they really are.
How can you not remember to stand still!
Listen here, Mammoth Lisa...
No I will not make your ears bigger! This is a portrait, not a cartoon!
All right, you got me, I'm Banksy!
I'll call it Mammoth X.
I'm paying you peanuts to model
Yes, I'll airbrush the pachydermatitis.
Stop pouting!
It ain't you, sweetheart, this boar-juice ink adds 50 pounds.
I'm not doing this for peanuts, you know!
Look, for the last time, I cannot afford to take you to the orthodontist.
If you can't stand still, I'm going to have to go with the auroch.
I know its getting cold outside but you need to hold still.
I paint it like I see it. Face it, your "wool" is gone!
You can call it a selfie.
Are you sure I can't interest you in a portrait you can take home with you?
Ever since onwall dating started I have had a steady career, the secret is to paint the trunk from the right angle.
Yes, we will roast some marshmallows when we're done!
I may be no Michelangelo, but you're no Dumbo, either!
No, this isn't the daily special. Honestly.
Everyone thinks they're an art critic!
In a few millennia, one one will even remember you had them!
I got it. You prefer your left side.
No, I said Tisk, tisk, not tusk, tusk.
Just how large do you want your tusks to be?
Can you smile enigmatically?
Don't worry, the wall adds ten pounds.
Quit smirking. My memory isn't as good as yours.
Stand still. This is for posterity!
Don't move
Sorry. Profiles only. Full face view has yet to be invented.
When I'm done you'll have the snout of a teenager!
stop complaining - i'm not done. the tusks are next.
The aurochs do not look more svelte.
‘Is this how want to be remembered?’
Another word and I'll draw me hunting you with a stick again.
It WILL look like you, after I mix up the white for your tusks, you'll see.
You weren't so critical at the Willendorf exhibit last week.
What was that? "there is no money in Art?"
Why do you keep turning to the right?
Turn your head a little to the right
Life-size is gonna cost you extra. I ain't exactly made of ink, y'know.
Do you need it for passport, or is it just for vanity?
I’m trying to show the real you- stop smiling
The cave adds 20 pounds.
No, I can't add starlight or unicorns. I don't have that app.
Coloring inside the lines is extra.
Move again and you're dead meat.
You're more butch with the trunk out.
I didn't forget the tusks, smartass. I haven't painted them yet.
Put it back up and hold it there.
I call it impressionism, there is no wrong.
That's all for today, we are losing the light.
Paint your tusks bigger? I don’t know what your agent told you but THIS is cave art not cave porn.
Yes, I can do ‘slimming’. But I believe ‘slender’ would be beyond artistic credulity.
Try to look more angry and prehistoric.
Not so many wrinkles, okay?
Raise your trunk for a feng-shui pose so the cave will sell - quickly!
Oh come on, this is a great clue!
Don't give me that look. An artist serves the truth.
Yes, I know you have a bigger proboscis, but nobody would believe it.
I thought without the horns you looked less menacing!
I call it, Reclining Nude.
Stop that............no body likes a half smile.
You look fantastic in the fire's light!
My legs are NOT that fat Ronald.
Do you want with or without tusks?
Forget the gentle wooly mammoth, Harry ! ... I want to see the scourge of Cro-Magnon: that massive, elephantlike mammal with fierce eyes and curved upper tusks!
Please, for history's sake, I need you to look more woolly!
I'm sorry the fire was hurting your trunk, but I need it held still and straight out for just a few more hours.
Relax, look into the distance and imagine a field before you.
Do you mind stepping a little closer, I don’t have my glasses.
Hush. Your not supposed to appear for another 500.000 years.
Yeah, I didn't think they really meant it when they said 'bomb them back to the stone age' either.
... and they'll wear this image on their hides and be so overwhelmed by your timeless beauty that they'll hate the new, condemn change and raise a moron who believes in the samo-samo to lead them.
Yes, the ritual concludes with us eating you. But you'll be immortal.
I like his trunk, but he's not very grayish!
I really think your horrible drawing is the elephant in the room here.
Ok, now what are you thinking for the caption?
I hear sows don't actually care about size, but yes, I can carve the tusks bigger if you want.
What do you see when you look at them?
I'd like posterity to think we were more than horn hunters.
I said pouty face!
Suck in your cheeks, lift your trunk or you'll never be on the cover of Vogue.
It’s for posterity. They’re going to love it.
Hold still! If you keep moving, you're gonna be extinct before I can finish this.
Be patient. When it's finished it will be a "mastapiece!"
Try not to move.
I'm telling ya, the key to cave dating is to have snazy wall pic.
Move your trunk again and I'll make sure this becomes a still life.
What are peanuts?
Now I'll always have something to remember you by.
I'm going to give you a little more hair, I think.
Mona, I'd like you to hold that special smile of yours.
O.K. Smile and move your trunk a little to the left. Hold it!
How many times do I have to tell you to hold still?
„No, you don‘t look fat.“
I know you don't have any problems remembering me, but I'm doing this for both of us!
They don't appreciate you until you're dead. In 50,000 years I'm going to be famous!
It does NOT make your trunk look too small.
Really- I need you to hold still.
And you’re OK with full frontal nudity?
I we made it bigger it would make you look fat.
Kibitzing does not enhance the creative process!
Hold still! We don't have much time before the Ice Age comes!
For the last time, I'm not trying to make you look fat!
Hold still or you'll end up with three tusks!
So, swipe left or right?
STAND STILL ALMOST DONE,YOU GONNA BE FAMOUS
The collagist will be here tomorrow to add the wool
Told ya, I can make you seem smaller than you really are.
A Wooly Mammoth. I really should have drawn an animal that is uncommon.
Will you stop evolving for a second? I don’t have all Stone Age to get this drawn, you know....
Okay, this is for the baby's corner. Look cuddly.
Yes, I put the art in artifact.
Remember...
Why would I eat your daughter? She was only this big.
This is elephant. Elephant must leave cave to poop.
Now maybe they will remember to talk about the elephant in the room.
You want to buy a vowel?
See how beautiful you will look after I take off your tusks.
You're why I paint on walls.
You like art but you have to pose sexy.
Relax...it's an ad for Viagra!
Now, you remember how to color it in, right?
Keep in mind that the paint adds ten pounds.
What do you expect? I also work for peanuts!
Gotta do it this way. No one will believe you were that big.
Stand still! You know I'm paying you a lot of peanuts to pose!
You'll be immortalized, yet extinct.
Could you tilt your trunk and smile without showing your teeth?
Do you think in a couple hundred thousand years they’ll know it’s scale drawing.
Hey, you forgot the marshmallows!
What - you need a bathroom break?
Do that thing where you curl your tusks like a mammoth.
Keep that trunk up please!
No marshmellow roast till your portrait is finished!
Stop complaining. I wish wallpaper existed too.
Ugh. The other cave artists made it look so easy.
No, I will not paint you 'like one of my French mammoths'.
I guess you were right... your memory is much better than mine
Why'd you put your trunk down?
Did I say you could look?
Either you stand still or I will bring out the mice.
If you had a mirror, this is what you would see... honestly!
" I have to leave room for your kids ".
Surely she’s not a real looker, but wait until I add the pink tutu.
Trunk up!
Now will you stop with the selfies?
Alright already....but who invented fire!?
Fun Fact: Leonardo Da Vinci's earliest known ancestor created "The Beautiful Whispering Wind of the Mammuthus Primigenius". After all these years, we finally discovered his inspiration.
Don't move: the fire creates the perfect dramatic lighting and highlights your sharp, aggressive tusks.
Stop messing with me and keep your proboscis up.
Sorry, caricatures are the next cave over.
You're not being paid peanuts to hold down your trunk!
It's not supposed to look like you. It's my artistic interpretation of you.
Your descendants will develop and lose a fortune in ivory.
Okay, so I need glasses!!!
All right, all right, maybe it's not the best likeness. I just don't remember what she looks like as well as you do.
Turn a little to the left and hold that pose.
We could go down in Pre-History if you would just give me that little Mona Mammoth smile.
Don’t worry about the shading. I’ll fix it in post.
I know, I know — The nose isn’t quite right...
How many likes do you think this one will get me?
Left Tusked? Hey, I’m left handed!
Okay, I'll make you less woolly and less mammoth.
Please try that enigmatic smile again.
I don't think it makes you look fat
Work with me here , and we'll get out of here before we are extinct.
I wouldn’t hold your breath. Retake day isn’t until the Cenozoic era.
I am almost finished, oh by the way, T Rex is right behind you and I don't think he is waiting for a protrait.
No offense, but you DO look a little like a warthog.
Why on earth did you think it would be drawn to scale?
This isn't a room it's a cave!!!!
Is it "Hannibal I Domum" or "Hannibal Ite Domus"?
I believe my work will be 'discovered' long after we're both extinct.
So you do think my tusks are small...
You're trouble is you don't appreciate modern art!
What's with the haircut?
Paleo Sex Ed
They say the cave wall adds 10lbs.
The morning light captures your playful side.
Don't blame me - everyone knows the cave puts on 10 pounds!
I won't make you look fat.
Tsk, tsk!
If I make your nose any smaller, they won’t be able to tell it’s you!
All my models get the same flat rate.
Keep holding that pose,we're doing great!
Who's the inventor of a medium here? The ears are FINE.
I'm the Mammoth Lisa
If you want to be famous, hold still for just a few more minutes!
No, I can’t make you look fearsome
Forget natural light. We’re making history here!
No, I'm not going to paint you like a French girl.
No you don't look fat in that light!
she must take after her mother.
The donkey tells me you are best friends.
I know you're facing extinction, so the fidgeting is not helping either of us.
For your information, I was Neolithically trained.
Its called art. And if you don't shut up, turn left, and hold still, I will NEVER get this finished.
Last week I had a T-Rex in here who was a real talker.
Remember, I still need to add perspective and it’s you as a much-younger mastodon.
Portrait work pays the bills, but my true passion is for hand stencils.
I told you. Peanuts- pose, peanuts- pose. Now stand still. At this rate we will be post historic.
You don't look fat but the stone always adds 10 pounds
Photoshop BC: "It looks exactly like you, but I did touch-up the wrinkles with the healing chisel."
You would rather have a selfie?
No tusks; too authoritarian.
Well…you actually look better without the tusks
OK Mona, take a break. I know your trunk gets heavy, but you must hold it up so I can capture that sweet little smile. I'm sure it won't be duplicated..... not in a million years!
I*m getting it, Sharon! Just keep your lower lip curled!
I fired My Agent!
The Mono Lithic
I said "posterity" not posteriority.
It's the best I can do until someone invents the mirror.
It'll look like you're flying when I'm done!
You’re not evolved enough to appreciate that I’ve captured your essence.
It's not your fault, the agency promised me a mammoth.
Okay,show me that enigmatic smile again.
What do you mean that's not how you remember it?
Remember this, the minute someone invents canvas we're outta here.
Realism hurts.
Smile for the cave drawing.
NO, I'm not making your butt too big.
I really appreciate this, it's a whole lot easier to draw this before we kill you.
It will be finished when its finished!
What do you mean “further to the right?”
Too early for Abstract Expressionism. I was thinking Fauvist.
‘That’s G.O.P. —- Grand Old PACHYDERM !’
I hope you appreciate that that means you'll be immortalized probably until next rain season.
Whaddaya mean, have I never been to Lascaux?!
I wonder if anyone will ever see my paintings?
It ALWAYS makes you look a few pounds heavier
What do you mean who are the guys with the sticks?
Sneeze, please. The ears aren't quite right.
They say the cave adds 10 pounds...
I know nobody gets it right now, but I have a strong hunch profile paintings are going to be the next bing thing.
Fine, fine, I admit it -- both my brush and this paint were made from your brother.
No.I won't forget the tusks!
I'll make your tusks bigger for the final painting, this is just a comp.
This is you as a baby before teething.
They never get my nose quite right.
Republican or Democrat, which one huh?
My wife's NOT gonna believe you just walked right in here.
I know it's not perfect. We're still evolving.
Chin up!
Now do you remember?
I’ve made you younger looking. Are you happy now?
Does this petroglyph make me look fat?
Yeah, you're fat and I'm Cro Magnon. Nobody's gonna care.
OK, I’ll do it over, but I promise, you didn’t look fat in the last four!
Yes, I'll make the tusks bigger.
That doesn't look like a genuine smile.
Hold still. This is going to take awhile.
Yes, you are MUCH better looking than the donkey I painted over.
If you don’t like it, I’ll just delete it.
What makes you think you can do any better with a burnt stick?
C'mon, work with me, baby.
OK, ok, I thought you liked being paid peanuts!
Republican Convention...post-Trump.
Listen, you pay peanuts, you get Neanderthal Man.
Sorry, but the wall always adds a few pounds.
No, I don't think the wall makes you look fat!"
OK, smarty, you try drawing a profile!
I asked for smaller ears and less gray. And I got no ears, no gray, one horn... I guess it's okay for a cave painting.
Could you stand sideways? Perspective won’t be invented for another ten-thousand years.
i know it's taking a long time, but i've never done this before.
Of course you’re bigger than this...
A little more to the right I'll capture your good side
I must warn you. My work is very post-Cretaceous.
Trunk up or trunk down, make up your mind.
I need you looking fierce; do you need another little blue pill?
I'll have to charge you extra for the tusks"
Honey- he won't stand still. Can you bring some tar?
Trust me. It looks more attractive on this side.
I’m not paying until it looks less like a pig and you add my tusks.
‘’Dude... you’ve missed my best feature!’
You're doing an excellent job, considering all you've been through...Now, what would you guess is the assailant's tusk size?
Unfortunately, 3D printers haven't been invented yet so you'll need to stick around for the blind men.
So what if it’s a little Photoshopped?
That is defiantly NOT my good side!
Show me your mysterious smile.
Don’t worry, I’ll put a filter on it
I've seen better. This guy is no Picasso!
Forget pink!
Believe me, people will only be talking about your smile
Your tusks are indeed wonderful so I’m saving them for last.
One day, all elephants will look like this ...
You want your species to be remembered, don't you?
Did you always have that mole?
I want him brought in alive.
They say the wall adds ten pounds.
Please stay frozen.
Oh, so everyone's a critic now, hunh?
I'm going to call it 'Before the Hunt.'
The wall subtracts 1500 pounds.
Maybe in fifty thousand years, people will finally acknowledge the elephant in the cave.
How will they know that we were friends?
Like we agreed, I took a ton off and you say I invented fire.
I'm sorry, but in this era, aggressive tusks are just not acceptable.
When I invent the piano, you're in trouble!
The fire light hits your trunk in a quite flattering manner.
One more snide comment and I'll add stink lines.
Look, your fellow Mastodons who were slaughtered are in my thoughts and prayers! But it's too early to politicize that tragedy by talking about spear control!
If we do a nip here, the left tusk should hide the tuck.
What do you mean you wanted a Selfie? What kind of crazy talk is that?
Could you just cut the smile!
This will disguise your obesity better then Photoshop.
Yeah? Well maybe I don't care what you like...Irving!
Don’t forget to like and inscribe...
I've got a 1:00 portrait with saber-tooth tiger, so let's stop for today.
Yes, I'm sure she'll like it, even if you did shave off all your hair.
You stink at Pictionary.
Now you're just going to be remembered as 'mammoth'.
You mean--that's what the Republican party will look like?
Let's see you remember how many elephants there are without a little help.
It’s called artistic license you bastard. And don’t tell me you don’t remember...you son of a bitch.
What do you mean it's not "anatomically" correct?
Don’t worry, this will get airbrushed.
Stop worrying, your tusks will be Huge in the finished picture.
You know, I think you should just be grateful I'm painting you rather than eating you.
Hold still, I'm losing the light.
Do you think I should draw it to scale?
Please try not to move.
A picture always adds 40 lbs.
Is that your good side?
A shade more to the left, please. Like yesterday. Remember?
Now smile...it's for posterity
And I made this mark when you were 2 years old.
Turn your head slightly to the left and look up!
Now show me your teeth.
Don't move ! I will make you immortal.
The tusks are super - but may be in demand, so let's leave them out and just do "Woolly Mammoth"?
Hold still or I’ll add 10 pounds
What do you say we add a mouse for good measure?
What do you mean, "It doesn't look like a wooly mammoth"?
as you can see by my depiction, you are not morbidly obese.
If you break wind one more time I’m going to ask the agency for a new model.
So you want me to 'like' the photo now?
Don't worry, I'll cover the finer points later.
HOLD STILL! Your next banana break is in ten minutes.
I'm also inventing artistic license.
I can give you 5 wallet-size pictures for 2 dollars more.
STOP MOVING! What do you think you're working for, PEANUTS?!
This is going to get a lot of likes!
Thanks for the tribute, I won't forget this.
I'm having a hard time capturing your negative space
This will last till tomorrow but if you do it—25,000 years I reckon.
It’s a little late to mention that you’d prefer a cubist approach.
Up to you, but I'd swipe right.
Hold still. The light is just right.
No, I don't know how to "photoshop".
Let's go? What do you mean, let's go?
Hold steady a few more minutes, and I'll get you all the peanuts you want.
For your information, it's art, not graffiti. And don't you forget it!
Don’t worry I’ll make sure you don’t look “toothy”
Well it's only a preliminary sketch OK
Sorry! I'm working with primitive materials you know!
No , no, your left side is your best feature.
Fire good but Mango make art!
Try not to show so much teeth.
. . . but I made you look younger
Don't tilt your head. You need to look fierce!
Like I said, the tusks make your nose look big.
Seriously, that face just screams longevity.
The light is perfect! Hold that pose, just raise your trunk. Show me some of your inner fierceness.
Too bad. Realism won't be invented for another 10,000 years.
Now, don't move!!
We’re here because all the studio spaces at Lascaux we’re booked.
I assure you it's not ivory. It's just a sharp stone.
What am I missing here?
If you keep moving, I'm going to have to hire another model.
Just because you're the elephant in the room doesn't mean you I have to make you look bigger than you are.
Because future people will be obsessed with the past, believe me!
At least in this room they will talk about you.
I know it's not my best...
What do you mean “you look fat” in it?
Now I know why so much of art is abstract.
I usually do profiles.
Don't look at me that way. I have not made your nose look too big.
Quit your whining! It's called 'artistic license,' Dumbo.
You're woolly all right, but not that woolly.
Lessons? I’m literally the first one to draw. Anything! Ever!
You wouldn’t believe how much I had to pay for a cave with good northern lights.
My first nude.
I'm a vegetarian too - as you might have guessed
You may not forget anything, but I certainly do.
Hey, you don't work for peanuts so I had to rush it!
Stand still!
Admit it! You got a hair cut since yesterday's sitting, didn't you?
I’m recording our love, beautiful companion!
I made you look happier for your portrait.
We guarantee you'll loose 2 tons in a month, we can make you look like this.
Enough whining; the agency contract says no peanut break until you've posed for three hours.
Smile again, please, the paint is drying.
You eat paleo, too?
Just be glad I'm wielding a brush and not a spear.
Oh, good!!! You got my good side.
Don't worry. I promise not to make your nose too big.
Ironically, I think you look better without the tusks
Stop moving or I'll make you extinct!
Stop evolving, I can't make any changes.
This is just a charcoal sketch, eventually you'll be in oil...
The lighting is all wrong.
Hold still. I am making a symbol for the GOP!
Sorry, you blinked!
Helen, could you stop fucking standing there and grab me another brewski or something? I worked my ass of ALL DAY and i would like to relax without you in my face for once, jesus
I have to make you smaller than real life because they haven’t invented stepladders yet.
I said " Don't move! "
I hope you’re accentuating my lips. I paid a lot for these lips.
Me swear, only made fire to see you better. Now come closer.
Artistic license !!!
Of course it's you, nitwit!
Love the smirk. Now give me that mammoth attitude that’s really gonna sell this cave.
I'm only showing your good side.
I’m sure she’ll be very impressed
Ok. Give me angry. No, no not that angry. That’s it.
What do you mean you can't remember what happened?
Never forget that you are not a snake, a fan, or a tree trunk.
Hold still. If this comes out nice, I may make it big as an artist in a billion years.
Poetic license.
That's ridiculous! I don't see any junk in your trunk at all. You're divinely Rubenesque.
Because if I drew you life sized it would take up the entire wall!
But you wanted me to make you look younger!
It's not my best work, but you're no Christie Brinkley either.
Some artists turn an elephant into a bit of paint, I turn a bit of paint into an elephant.
Don't give me that look, you know the cave adds ten pounds.
You look great. Remember, the chisel adds 100 pounds.
Trust me we’re going viral in 2000 years!
You really haven't lost weight it's just with limited wall space I need to scale my paintings down.
I know you want a bigger trunk but Surrealism isn’t a thing yet
OK, but this is the last time. Why in the hell are you beasts so damn forgetful?
No ,I can't just draw you from memory!
People will go crazy for this in 40,000 years.
'I am going for a neo-Neolithic look, give me a little more of a menacing glare.'
The donkey was a much better model.
Early Failures in Cave Training: "Just a few more minutes and I'll take you outside".
I can't believe I agreed to do this for 'exposure'. Exposure to who?
Look, sorry to interrupt, but I both never forget and don't really need you to humansplain mammoths to me.
Tsk, tsk. Your descendants will thank me in the end.
I can’t make your ears any bigger. We’re in India.
And when you find her be nice, as female elephants never forget.
Sorry...these cave paintings always add about 500 pounds.
Good muse; nice and easy, good muse . . . .
Yes, I consider this a contribution to Early Political Art.
... and then, she told me to paint her like one of my French girls
We're upgrading you from read-only memory.
Relax, the cave wall adds ten pounds.
Paleoglyphs always add a few pounds!
This one is for posterity.
For the last time, quit smiling!
I'll fix this in post.
I know you are tired...but you must turn left and face the light.
Done with shortening your trunk! Now, how would you like to shape your tusks?
You don't have to draw it out, I remember what you said the first time.
No I won’t apply a filter, and no you cannot hold the selfie stick, this is a painting.
That's nice - really sexy!
Cave wall enhancer man,can you air brush my mammoth wrinkles and my long grey body hair? And could you give me a lava-like, pink glow?
Now the suspect had no tusks and 'African' ears, Right?
Okay, I’m gonna leave the tusks out. They’re tricky.
Trumpet all you want--I'm not giving you a bigger trunk.
Will you remember this pose for tomorrow's work?
Just five more minutes. THEN you can have the bun.
Time for the final touches. Say, "Cheese."
Tusk, tusk. I'm a cave painter dammit!
"Until you figure out how to hold the brush, your the model and I'm the artist".
Don't worry. The cave drawing takes off 200 pounds.
What a smile! You've got a magnificently chiseled face!
I’ve decided to depict your nose as not all that mammoth.
Mastodon no worry. Cave wall add ten pounds.
Do you want me to make your tusks a little longer?
I’m trying to capture the way you looked the first time you saw a mouse. Take it or leave it.
Again?! You just came in from your walk!
I haven't seen your friends outside since it started to get colder; come to think of it, I haven't seen my friends either.
OMG.... That really stinks! Next time just ask to take five, okay?
Can you do a running pose? I need some narrative content for the others.
Stop with the Criticism. That hasn't been invented yet.
This is your cousin Irving. He's obviously not as evolved as you are, but he's family. What can we do?
Move a lot more to the right and you can become a national symbol.
Don't worry, I'm not making you look fat. Just wait til I run this through Photo Shop!
Smile, you're on candid cave art!
You keep giving me a droopy trunk and I'll leave out your tusks.
I’m sorry but the wall adds 800 lbs.
Are you almost done? My trunk itches.
My nose isn't that big!
is this really your best side?
Yeah I know I didn't capture your expressive eyes... it's primitive art!
I don't care how many of your friends come stampeding in here, THIS is an elephant!
Tusks? Could you stop evolving until i finish, please?
Stay still. If I mess up, you'll never let me forget.
I'm the first Log Cavern Republican.
Show more emotion, you're very angry.
The fire light makes you look a bit long in the tooth.
Its only a selfie if you chiseled it yourself.
One more lift for the peanut.
I'm actually an architect.
Hold still!
Stop moving, or I'll make your ears too big!
Okay, now show me that beautiful profile!
Could you turn your head and look a little more...coquettish?
Hold still. 40,000 years from now, we'll be famous!
Illustration's a sideline for me. My true love is animation but the market penetration isn't there yet.
No, you can’t put your clothes back on yet.
Hold still; they are going to want a record of who lived here.
Wet your lips and pout, I want you to give me sexy.
Tusks not big enough?
Hold still with the eyelids, I'm trying to capture you exactly as you are.
Look, nobody's gonna know. So try to look more like a ferocious wooly mammoth than just a tired old mastodon.
Make up your mind: I can do the tusks big or I can do the tusks small.
I liked the other filter better.
Please turn your head toward the light.
You're exuding a mammoth amount of ennui right now. I can't work like this.
This is you if you keep going to that Chinese dentist.
You think you can do better?
I'm not going for realism. I'm going for lasting art.
I can't finish this unless you stand absolutely still.
Pay attention: Facebook is easy. For example, this is your wall.....
You're pushing me into my Gray Period.
Ok, let's try a less enigmatic smile this time.
And your first name?
Now add just a hint of a smile.
I am doing this so you won't forget.
You want one without the fur?
Is that really your only pose?
I thought that WAS your good side.
If you don't hold still, extinction won't be fake news.
It's called artistic license!
No! No! We’re not going for regal. We agreed this should be coquettish. Now drop the shoulder forward and cock the knee.
Hey buddy, could ya hold still! And another thing, this bright, warm, crackling light is a new invention called fire. If you fart in here, you are going to blow us both to smithereens!
I think I'll call you Babar.
Why don't we try it with a smile this time?
I'm gonna make you a superstar, honey
You have to go outside AGAIN?
Well, it wasn’t me!
Oh, look, another profile.
Because I can't get the saber tooth to sit still, that's why.
1.) "Don't worry, I'll blur out your acne." 2.) "Let me address the elephant in the room." 3.) "If this turns out well, I call dibs on posting."
I don't know why, it's just awkward.
Oh my God, delete that.
Yes, it's your good side.
You know your stare carries a lot of weight!
In 30,000 years you'll be famous!
Hold still Jerry, the selfie isn't invented yet!
I told you this is an homage, not a portrait.
It does NOT make you look fat!
Freeze
What do YOU think would be a good caption?
A little to the left please!
Ok. I'm a lousy artist, so sue me.
Your trunk doesn't look too small!
The rest of the focus group should be here any minute.
Stay still! Trunk out, please.
I am NOT making you look fat!
Wake up! I'm not paying you uncultivated peanuts to sleep.
Stop kvetching. This IS your good side!
Will you stop slouching!
Yes. I agree, your left side is your best.
Yeah! Yeah! Everyone's a critic. Just shut up and hold still!
You're fired!
No. I'm not using the same caption as the last caveman cartoon. OK?
We could try putting it on milk cartons.
Hold still! I can't do this if you keep waving that thing around!
No. This is realism. I will not make you look thinner.
Damn it ! For the last time, can you please keep your trunk elevated.
You're too big; I'm a minimalist.
Chill - you'll thank me when you're extinct.
Do you think you can remember to stay still today?
I told you before this is going to be a nude.
I'll always see you as a baby.
I’ll need a piece of your tusk to paint your tusks.
No, I'm not painting lasers coming out of your tusks!
No, I'm a realist. I cannot make you look thinner.
Please don’t label it “Lil Trumpet Man”
I’m doing this for peanuts.
It is a mammoth painting. Its just not very big.
Artists work for peanuts, but as my model you'll get a 25% cut.
Hope you don't mind if I take a few notes.
Quit doing duck lips! It's a portrait, not a selfie.
For crying' out loud, put the wooly coat back on! Some things should be left to the imagination.
Well, they looked smaller on the other side of the cave!
Just give me 5 more minutes, then you get a bathroom break.
It’s called “artistic license”! And trust me; your image will be preserved for the ages!
No, that's a tad too much to the right...
After I learn to draw hands, you’re fired!
Stop complaining. What do you expect? I told you not to move.
Of course it's not as clear as your photographic memory of the event!
I think we need to have a conversation about trunk and tusk envy.
Cave bears, saber-tooths, a couple of giant beavers, but mostly mammoths.
Let's both run away and join the circus.
Mona, please stand still. I need to get your smile just right
Can you lean further to the right, please?
I couldn't do this without you!
All I’m saying is, lose the tusks and you could be big in politics.
Could you turn sideways for me?
Now give me a look that says,"I've just been mortally wounded by a skilled archer, but he's so dreamy that I'm strangely okay with it."
You dictate. I’ll write.
Whaddya mean 'it needs a caption'? What the hell is that!?
Stop exaggerating. Everyone knows the cave wall adds ten pounds.
I know I left out the tusks!
Don't worry. I can draw your trunk as less prominent.
Keep that pose
Just keep still. This is one for the ages.
I know it's 2 dimensional, but my therapist told me to just address the elephant in the room
So what if you aren't wooly? I think you have a look that will last!
As you can see, this diagram addresses the elephant in the room.
I can't understand why you think this makes you look fat.
Don't you "tusk, tusk" me. I'm not done.
Okay, for posterity, I’ll give you an extra 6” on your tusks.
Don't worry, I left out the wrinkles.
You made my nose too big
It’s just a hobby. I know it’s not going to be in the Smithsonian.
Stop smiling. I'm trying to catch your serious side.
Alright, alright, I won't make your nose look too big
This is what you’ll look like after we remove the tusks, you won’t look as cool, but people in the future will stop hunting you
I’d finish a lot quicker if you would quit moving.
Well, that just proves pornography is in the eye of the beholder.
Could you look a little more interested, engaged, less bored, Please?
Hey Im drawing a picture of my dog on the wall stop moving!
Stop laughing. The portrait may not be perfect but I did get us fire.
Stand still. We want everyone to talk about the elephant in the cave.
But you DO have a week chin.
I said make me look slimmer not smaller
No I did not make your butt look big on purpose.
Well excuse me for not knowing your left side is your bad side.
Could you step outside? You're breaking my concentration.
Hold still. I want to paint you like a French elephant.
Trust me. Your left is your good side.
Nearly there. Don't move.
Don't turn too far to the Right. It's nobody's best side.
It's not perfect but grad students will go into debt to study it in a million years.
Please try to look a little more menacing.
No, I can't make you look any younger.
Sorry about the poor lighting.
In time, you'll be famous!
OK, OK - prehensile trunk. You can have the chalk soon as I finish.
Hold still. The Republican Convention opens here tomorrow and I have to get the cave properly decorated.
Yes...an etching by master Don could make you famous!
...and after the swelling goes down, voila!
It's not all about you. It's me that will be remembered
Don't worry about that! Not too many of your kind will fit at the opening and your mother will love it no matter what
Can you give me a little more "happy" in the eyes?
It's my own invention. I call it a 'dating site'.
Turn slightly to your right.
I don't care that you're pink. Who will ever know the difference?
Don’t feel bad. I told you the chisel adds 10 pounds.
I'll ChiselShop your double chin out, don't worry!!
Your tusks are two feet long, not three. History matters.
If you keep moving like that, I'll have to start all over.
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOUR TRUNK CLOSED
Lucky you. You’ll be at the top of the menu.
Hey, I'm a charicature cave artist.You want realism, go to Manet's cave!
I can lengthen your tusks, increase their curve, raise your shoulders, lengthen your legs, tighten your body length, and implant wooly hair, but, even in the dark, he’ll still know you’re a mastodon, not a mammoth. Your teeth are all wrong.
Explain bitcoin to me one more time
how do you expect me to draw the true you with that sagging trunk?
Stop complaining, you told me to make you look younger.
Mirror mirror on the wall...
Actually, I'm a democrat. I caved for the extra commission.
stop correcting me. I’m the artist !
Stand still, I want to get your trunk just right.
I think it's pretty darn good for Pictionary.
Did you say, 'Tsk, tsk' or 'tusk, tusk'?
Stop complaining. I can hire a replacement model for peanuts.
I think it’s time we address the elephant fart in the room.
So this is your first modeling gig? You seem like a natural.
I thought you might be interested in posing for my “Wall of Extinction Exhibit”
Interrupt me again, and the tusks are gone entirely
It’s hard to capture your personality with a stick.
Don't look so smug...it's not like an elephant can paint.
This job became a lot more dangerous once we moved beyond stick figures.
You look bloated. Are you bloated?
What do you mean, you "forgot" to stand still?
Okay, I'll title it 'Man's Best Friend', but won't that always be obvious to everyone?
Alright. I'll make you thinner next time.
Okay, Geoff, We agreed no comments from the peanut gallery!
I knew we shouldn't have done this inside...somebody get me a shovel!
Stand still already or I ain't gonna pay you peanuts.
I am impressed that you can make fire, but as an artist you suck.
C’mon. You can get this. If you subtract the nine and carry the two....
Yes, if I draw pants on you it will make your ass look fat.
At least there will evidence that one of us lived here.
Well, the wall does add 5 pounds or so.
Sure - if you can sit for me for 6 hours a day, I will make you famous.
Don't you see, by altering your physique; shortening your legs and tusks, swelling your middle, I have created the first elephant joke. Proving once and for all, Neanderthals had a better sense of humor than Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.
So what if I made your nose too big!
You really do look better without the tusks.
We can slim you down with shading!
One more time; you blinked.
How many times do I have to tell you? This will rub right off!
No, no. It's the cave walls, they add ten stones.
I paint motion pictures! If you wanted a still life, you should have gone to the grotto down the hill!
I'm sorry but you are fat.
So, I was the only one who would address the elephant in the room!
Don't make me look mammoth.
Yes, I will paint you like one of those French elephants.
I know "size matters" but it's not like I can run up to the cave on the corner and buy more paint.
Oh I'm sorry, did I draw your son?
You're sure you want them that big?
"Do you want it with or without your trunks on?" Rob Mulderry, Rye, NY
Time to impress the elephant in the room.
Ewww I look ugly, delete it.
The fire makes you look 100 pounds heavier
This will be the "before" picture.
One day this wall will be worth 35 berry bushes, just you wait.
You can keep trying your Tuscaloosa joke all you want, but it won't work for several millenia.
Well, I'm really good at stick-men, but you're an elephant.
Yeah, the opening receptions can be crazy, man.
It's supposed to look childish. This is the children's cave.
It's all about the smile.
Call it: "Portrait of T-rump"
So YOU think it's longer.
So the plan is to invent agriculture, then bronze and cities, then iron and bigger cities, then the Renaissance and the Internet. But then we get Trump…
Hmm, maybe just give me an ambiguous little half-smile...
If you think it's so easy you do it!
I know you're in the room, but that doesn't make you a respected critic.
Points well taken, but hold still.
Back off Tusky, think you can do better?
OK, once this goes viral, you'll be ready to launch a clothing line.
You do look slimmer with smaller tusks.
Turn your tusks a little to the left
Can you wipe off that enigmatic half-smile?
I won't forget if you make me fat.
There will be absolutely no coconuts if you can't hold the trunk up for the full hour
What, you don't like pink?
Do I have to spell it out for you?
Man’s best friend, the early years.
Don't tusk-tusk me!
I'm impressed with how much you remember from last week's lesson.
What do you mean you don't remember the color of her eyes?
How about a bigger smile?
I hate to give you the bad news, but you are fat.
It'll look more real as soon as someone invents better lighting.
This is my cave. I'm trying to make a subtle suggestion that you leave.
I know you want it "life-size" but I have have to leave room for the other animals.
Yes, by all means, go outside for a bathroom break.
The easiest way to get a cute little turned up one is to remove the tusks first.
And by extending the trunk outward, you will appear to have all the answers.
You will never be forgotten
So, how long have you been working for Fred & Wilma?
Can't you hold it until I'm finished.
Earliest known paparazzo.
OK, OK. I won't make you look too fat.
What do you expect, it's not a photograph.
This will go on your permanent record!
Can you turn a little to the left and uncurl your trunk?
Not very photo-realistic! I'm working with clay and spit over here Harvey.
Well I'm sorry. Abstractionism hasn't been invented yet.
C'mon, hold still! After all, I'm paying you peanuts!
Of course I can make you look thinner, but my art is about TRUTH!
"I've already told you, it's supposed to look like that. It's called cubism".
The only reason you got this gig is that you work for peanuts.
Hold still while the light from the meteor lasts.
Doesn't capture your soul? Do you realize how many eons it'll be before my species even comes up with that concept?
For an extra 20 can you add a couple inches.
You're really capturing my essence.
Don't you judge me. It's art!
Show me some tusk.
Just remember, the Prehistoric paint brush adds a few hundred pounds.
Me done inventing for today.
I always find legs difficult.
It's meant to be satirical.
You can rest your trunk in another five minutes.
Looks a bit primitive to me...focus more on my skin texture
Don't be so bitter, everyone knows that cave paintings add about 10 pounds.
When we’re done would you mind sending in big tooth cat?
Give me a wry smile, Mona.
This isn’t Thailand and, no, you may not borrow my paint.
Hold it . . . . Don’t move .... that’s it. ..... perfect ... got it.
Yes, I'm afraid that your nose IS that big.
I know it doesn't look like you. It's an allegory.
I just need to finish this tusk
Now, this part is important. Don't forget.
Could you just try to look a little less icy?
You should really trim those tusks.
Who you calling' "Dumbo"!
Com'on now, you remember how to smile.
Just relax, the paint brush adds ten pounds.
Hold still - I'm new at this.
I can only paint what I see. So if you want a sabre tooth tiger, you'll have to bring me a sabre tooth tiger...
Throwback Thursday.
If you can hold still for just a few more minutes I promise we'll go clubbing.
It's a caricature
One of these days someone will invent Botox. Then you will look like your painting.
Did you say, 'Tsk, tsk' or 'tusk, tusk'?
Mammoth,shmammoth-just be glad I have some space left.
Please raise your trunk above your tusks and hold it there until I am finished.
Good. And if you could just turn your head a little, away from the bows and arrows...
"Yes, I'll title it "Master Don" instead.
Sorry, no politics in the cave.
Waddaya mean,'The nose is too big'?
I told you already: I don't do 'actual-size'!
Hey, you moved. Hold still. I am almost finished.
So it's not you. What do you expect from an unemployed cave painter?
Don’t forget! Keep your trunk up… It’s good luck!
Oh relax! Cave paintings make you look 1500 pounds lighter.
‘It’s so, after dinner, we won’t forget you as we show gratitude for your sacrifice !’
You’re the one with the memory...so how did it begin?...”We The People of the United States...?”
Perspective would make you look fat.
OK, OK. I know it's primitive. This is just my hobby.
I know you need a headshot by next Tuesday! I'm going as fast as I can!
I refuse to work for peanuts!
I discovered fire and art in rapid succession.
Geico commercial. Relax.
Framing is not an option.
Stay still until I finish! If I can complete your “Elephant in the Room” portrait, you’ll never be forgotten!
Keep that trunk up! I'm not finished yet!
You're casting a shadow.
See, I'm putting you on the lease!
Don’t worry, I will add #nofilter
Did you just fart,or was that earthquake?
No No No! I asked the modeling agency for a wholly mammoth and you are what they send me?
Lower your tusks a couple inches.
Don't worry.It's a likeness .Future people will not think you had very small "tusk's"
I'm really not very good at tusks.
Say 'Bamboo'.
I’m sorry. The wall adds 10 pounds.
"Because frames haven't been invented yet, dumbo!'
Every time you move, I can't capture the firelight!
Hold still - I’m trying to catch your bone structure.
The trunk is UP for good luck.
"I don't care if your rocking motion is a characteristic, stand still.
Hold your tusk for just a while longer. We haven't invented film yet.
It's winter fat! You'll lose it in the spring.
It's an editorial cartoon... now tell the jackass to get in here!
Look, when they invent money, I promise I'll pay you.
Hey !, Dumbo... Stay still.
You look very extinct.
After you've been through art school, you can criticize my technique.
Look! This isn’t for your girlfriend, it is for posterity!
I turn my back for a second and the beaver is gone?
No, I wouldn't say "mammoth".
Could you make that smile a bit more enigmatic?
Look! This is a female, and you are a male! Get it!
Could you get a move on Ogg, I was a mammoth when you started painting.
I don't care if you have to go, just thirty more minutes please.
Get the janitor!
It's that mysterious smile of yours that's so hard to capture.
Sorry, cave drawings are forever. I can’t use my artistic license to minimize the tusks.
No, I won't enhance the tusks!
It's representational art, dumbass.
I’m almost done. Can’t you hold it?
Not exactly what I expected when I requested an all-natural female model!
The only left to do now is to sign it. There..."Master Don."
are you comfortable in that position?
Always the Critic!
Don't look! I'm not finished yet.
I’ts not my fault if you have small hands.
Don't be an ass.
Yes, I'm going to draw the room next.
That's ok, I can photoshop the tusks!
Im tired of cave cartoons.
The paleo diet did wonders for your body.
It's not an exact likeness.
What makes you think you have a 'good' side?
Quit your bellyaching; I told you I don't paint the tusks until the end!
Never lose those tusks... they happen to be gorgeous.
Pee on your own time.
You’ve got to stay still! If you wanna be the first ‘Elephant in the Living Room’, you need to stand patiently.
It’s called a “selfie.” Now stand still while I run over there...oh wait.
Wait until I add the tusks, I promise you will not look fat.
Enough with the elephant jokes; I want an elusive smile!
I'm sorry, but you really are THAT fat
Wipe that smirk off your face.
Wadda mean it's not a very good likeness ? I tell ya in 20,000 years they're going to eat this right up.
I'm going to sell it to a Saudi prince for $450 million.
There was a problem loading the caption. Retrying (3 attempts left)
Stand still,already!
If you want to keep working for peanuts, stop fidgeting!
Meanwhile in the republican caucus room...
Don't blame me! The wall adds 10 pounds.
WORK IT!
I tweaked the exposure. Want me to change the saturation?
You moved.
Stop looking so primitive! And, next time, shave.
I really don't care what your good side is!
Whaddya mean I got the eyes wrong!!!
Would you turn your tusk a little to the left?
Again, don’t move!
Well, at least two dimensional doesn’t make you look fat.
This would be much easier with an Iphone.
If you don't stop moving, I'm going to hire an aurochs.
Come on! Have you forgotten how to smile?
I didn't invent fire so you could phone this session in, dammit.
"Tusk, tusk" is a pretty insulting comment.
Tilt you head a little to the right and hold your trunk up higher.
I'm doing my best; it's a right-handed brush.
Strike the pose, dammit.
My right side is my best side ??
I think I may switch to landscapes.
It's evolution and, yes, it's a difficult concept, but eventually it will come to you.
It's not my fault that you have 'too much junk in the trunk'.
Stop squirming!
No. It does not need a donkey to even things out. I vote no on that.
Keep moving and I'll get me a new model!
Modeling does seem like a better career path than zoo work.
Art of the Mammoth II
Like?
Why is he defending Donald?
Yes, I’ll draw you like one of my French girls.
I am trying to make you look more soft and gentle.
Try to look natural.
I'm going to make you famous.
Oh, for posterity's sake, would you please stand still!
Trunk forward.
Trust me. You will never be known as `Wooly Little' in a tweet storm.
I call it 'art.' It will be mammoth.
We can be here forever as far as I'm concerned!
Don't blame me, they say the cave adds 5 tons...
Mastodrawn.
Remind me, how many aardvarks were in that recipe?
Mammoth, the wall loves you!
Jeez, just give me 10 more minutes!
Relax, I will make your tusks longer and whiter when I'm complete!
Yes, I realize you will never forget if I mess this up.
This fire will make you look so much hotter in this painting
I'm trying to make you look fluffy, not fat.
I said to gesture towards your PEANUTS!
I'm not going to make it longer.
I always take a picture of my food.
Now's not a time to get horny, can't you see I am working?
I was hoping they'd send over someone a bit more chic, but at least we've got a sturdy build to work with.
I ask for woolly and you bring me bald.
In a million years when they find this you'll be famous. Now hold still please.
No, this is a caricature of you.
No duckface please
Trust me! I paint what I see. You have small ears!
You moved - oh boy, did you move. Why didn't you tell me you needed a break?
Stand very still. The tusks are the hardest part.
Jenny, I think we just invented an aphorism.
Bigger tusks . . . ?
I know. I thought Annie Leibovitz was going to be here also
Of course I'm disappointed. I expected you to draw my good side.
Mondays are your days to spray down the cave.
Fire. High art. Civilization. The bomb. Wait for it, you’ll see....
If I don't draw the picture no one will believe this is how you look after a shave
No, I will not Photoshop it to make you thinner.
Hold still, or in a million years, you’ll be a detested symbol.
Hold that pose and don't move. And please stop smiling.
Don't move. I've got the lighting just right!
Don't worry, we'll clean it up in post.
Please stay still. Almost done.
How Trump's followers insist creationism works , you draw something on the wall and it just shows up.
THIS is what you dragged me in here for?
Have you looked in a mirror recently?
Don't be offended. I am trying to be more bipartisan. So, I am drawing the donkey next.
Nude, or with the wooly coat?
Yes, this is your good side!
Stop complaining, or I’ll draw AND quarter you.
Don't even THINK about snorting that trunk full of water on the fire.
Hey, if it was perfect then future anthropologists would know how brilliant we are and we don't want to scare them!
I want you to look more fearsome and delicious.
For crying out loud, will you just stand still?
It's simple, just try it: you put your right foot in, you put your right foot out . . .
Stop moving so much!
And then we'll have a "by invitation only" reception, complete with heavy hors d'oeuvres like deviled pterodactl eggs, and, pardon the expression, braised mammoth patties. And for entertainment, maybe a new age rock band!
Uuggah! Mmmduf hadooo! hah, hah. (Sure. I can make your truck stiff! Ha, ha.)
“I think you would look much better with bigger ears”.
Is THIS how that phrase started?
We call it...losing weight.
It's just a nursery decoration! - Who's gonna care in ten thousand years?!
This will be a lot better if you take EVERYTHING off
Can’t you remember to stand still?
Now, smile! – or it's back to the circus.
Hey, 'shit-for-brains,' how many times to I have to tell you, it's just a drawing!
This is your baby picture
You complain now about its accuracy but in a million years a guy named Picasso will give you three tusks and five eyes.
How did I possibly ever sexually harass you?
Whaddayamean...it's not realistic?
No, I’m not going to paint your ear bigger. And yes, that IS what it looks like on your head.
No, this drawing does not make you look fat.
Size doesn’t matter
OK, OK. So I'm no Thomas Eakins!
It does capture your essence. When you absorb everything about the image, you will feel it.
She'e beautiful, why did you swipe left?
I'll get to that question on the next slide
Stand still while I finish your tusks!
New Yorker Website has been broken for days - can't sign in. We’ll be right back We are busy fixing the website. Please try again soon.
Nose up!
To be or not not to be
Will you stand still, please? The judges will be here any minute and I am struggling to get the third dimension!
Okay, so I'm not an abstract expressionist.
Now it just needs a caption...what's that? A contest you say?
If we're caught off guard by a flood there'll be a picture of you for the anthropologists.
You know, this could be a masterpiece if you'd give me an enigmatic smile.
A little more trunk, a little less tusk please!
For the last time.....give me that haunting smile.
And so began the Ted Talk...
No, I don't think your trunk makes your tusks look big.
I specialize in nudes.
what? people want something real because as Kendrick Lamar said ''i'm so sick and tired of the photoshop''.
Now comes the name. You like "rhino"?
If you don‘t stand still, you‘ll only be remebered as a regular elephant.
No, I'm not going to eat you.
I told you! I am sure this is your good side.
Just think of it as you -- only more evolved.
Stop fidgeting! I'm giving you immortality.
It doesn't speak to me either.
I just got this weird sensation that I'm now a big disappointment to my father.
Don't sneer at me. It's my "impression" of what you look like.
Just hold it there for another eon....
For the last time, I did NOT make you look mammoth!
Do you think I've got too much junk in the trunk?
Tusk, tusk, it is close enough.
Next!
No, this will not make your butt look too big.
For me, painting is about more than just capturing your likeness on a cave wall – it’s about telling your story.
Sorry but I'm just a child portraitist.
I know it makes you look fat, have you looked in a mirror recently?
I call it "Sunday in the Cave With Jumbo"
Can you add a bit to the trunk? I just got of the pool.
Cheat towards the light, I need your good side
A picture is worth a thousand herds!
For the last time, I'm not going to make the tusks "bigger".
Just another few minutes of patience and we will have your essence preserved for for at least a millennia or so.
How’bout an action pose.
This will be worth big bucks when I'm gone. Which will probably be soon based on your body language.
I told you to try the paleo diet.
Your tusks are slimming.
If you don’t lose the attitude, it’s gonna be mouse time.
Drop your left tusk a little.
I do know I only have one whack at this.
It's called 'foreshortening', mister art critic.
Elephant evolution: “What do you mean you can’t remember? It’s your mother. That’s something you should never forget!”
The tusks would be easier in profile.
Could you make my trunk a little longer?
What do you mean, “It makes me look fat”?
I still say there’s a better chance of staying relevant if I leave them out...
move your head a little to the left so the light reflects off your tusks.
Hold still will you!
Yes, your tusks are bigger than your brother’s.
You must stand still!
Hold still. This is where the mirror would be if we had one.
I said stay still, this is for posterity!
I may be no daVinci but you're hardly a Mona Lisa yourself!
... so the profession is 'influencing'?
I call this a selfie.
Yes, I know that you find your tusks unbecoming, but as an artist I must draw what I see.
The wall adds 10 pounds!
I didn't expect all this attitude from a soon-to-be-extinct mammal.
You call that a trunk?? What are you.....a Neanderthal..
Hold still, dammit. I'm trying to get the perspective.
"I am going to title this Wooly Bully".
Would you take a moment to trumpet?
Sorry, I can't let you see it until it's finished.
It's only a Snapchat, Heather!
What did you expect you'd look like ... I'm an orthodontist not an artist.
Years from now, you will still be remembered.
Left profile is definitely the best look for you.
We have to do it again; your trunk was sticking straight out.
She may not be a looker but she has a heart of ivory.
Well, you're not the ideal model either!
Warning! The following scenes may be disturbing to some viewers.
I'll have our editor retouch your wrinkles.
Keep your tusks still so that I get them just right.
Don't worry, we'll airbrush out the cellulite.
I'm only doing this because the camera hasn't been invented.
Hold still; I'm trying to capture those two worthless projections.
... aaaaaand, freeze.
Quit asking me if you look fat.
No, I can't upload this to Tinder.
Don't. Move. I'll scratch it for you.
I think I really captured your trunk.
We discussed this. I can't pay you with anything tangible, like food. You are doing this for the exposure.
If you can just hold that pose a little longer, you'll be known for all posterity.
No, it may not look just like you, but I'm trying to capture your soul.
This is a cave! We can't change the floor plan to fit you.
Are you saying you don't remember what your lost baby's ears look like?
Good, darling. You look positively endangered!
We'll add the hunters later in post.
Stand still so I can finish your portrait! You don’t want the future to think that we were all Democrats, do you?
Yes, I can chisel it longer
I just realized I can’t sell this painting unless I sell my place.
Aw c'mon, you don't look fat!
If you want me to capture your good side, you need to stop wiggling.
I know this is taking a long time, but charcoal on rock is not that easy!
I can only assume that the back of you looks something like this?
What, you want more tusk?
I'll paint them as they are -- we can Photoshop them later.
Don't you think a 3/4's pose would be more flattering?
It’s not laziness, it’s postmodern!!
Compared to what?
Tired? Tired? Do you want me to get this right or not?
I thought an elephant on the wall was better than an elephant in the room.
BIGGER
Because we will remain a dignified Party. And if it is global warming, why do we still need a fire?
I'm not the one who keeps fidgeting!
Go lay down!
Stand very still. I'm painting you for posterity.
Are you sure you want to face that way? Last week your “good side” was the other side.
I’m going to write it down just in case.
Hey....... if I make it life size, thousands of years from now archeologists will think I was a crack pot!
Stay still. That's the perfect lighting.
Don't worry; in 10,000 years, the likeness will be history.
How to teach your elephant to draw.
Who are you calling endangered ??!!
The natural light really brings out your eyes.
In portraiture, less is more
Sorry, I think I need a bear. Kingdom of the Cave Mastodon doesn’t really work.
Posing nude is unconventional, but maybe we can start a trend.
You're a model, not an art critic. No tusks!
That's not your best side.
Hold still please for a few more minutes....
All right, YOU try drawing it!
I hear you, but if we draw actual size we run out of cave. Don't worry; everything will be to scale.
You're looking good like a young lady should.
Now is a fine time to tell me that you get paid extra for posing nude.
Now get out there and find her before she goes extinct!
Because if you don't write it down, how would you remember it?
Listen, Mr. Bigshot Critic, I'm abstracting the essential elements of shape, form, color, and texture, producing results that are millennia ahead of my time.
Hold still Ill mess up your trunk.
Because I don't want to talk about what's in the room.
If you're cold, I can get you another space heater.
Like I told you, I'm painting a miniture.
It reminds me when you weren't so long in the tooth.
I asked the modeling agent for a mastodon not an elephant!
I told you, the cave adds ten pounds.
I can't wait to see Schjeldahl piss all over this one too.
Please hold the pose. This must be accurate.
Don’t worry. If you don’t like it, Photoshop will be along in a few millennia
Could you just forget what I said about your tusks?
This is just the beginning. Wait’ll we do the trunk show!
Just a bit more profile, please.
Even this will pass
Hold that pose! I'm farsighted!
You want a life-size picture? Are you kidding me?
Aren't you being a bit thin-skinned?
I can't label it 'not actual size,' because we haven't developed written language yet.
Like it or not these are the new mating rituals. If you're interested you can "swipe right" on her picture or you can go back to the watering hole alone.
I’m painting you trans gender so get over it!
Now everyone will remember that you own the rights to fire.
I don't care if you knocked em' dead at Lascaux. I want a shaggier model!
Poetic license.
Sorry, but this is your best side.
Me appreciate if you don't do Mona Lisa smile for picture.
I respect your opinion but remember this, you’ll be extinct by the time this art is truly appreciated.
You weren't supposed to see my hunting petrograph.
I'm doing portraits now, but I'm thinking of taking up political cartooning.
You try to keep your trunk up for hours!
The digital copy will be an extra $35.
Don't worry, it's just a rough sketch, the final portrait will be in oil.
Primitive ultrasound
If I have to wash one more self-portrait off this wall...
Okay! Okay! I'll send one to your cell phone!
Early application of rock art, commonly known as Pictogram.
Yes, I'm going to draw your tusks, but I'm going to put them in the right place.
Don't worry, the brush adds 10 pounds.
In this day and age they'll think I was stoned while painting!
Don't move! You're almost finished.
Why the Hell not?
Try to remember, keep the trunk up.
If I take off any more fat you’ll look like a trilobite.
Ok, ok. I'll make your trunk 'Uge, Massive, BIGGEST TRUNK EVER!
Maybe if you reclined.
I'm done Elsie, the tusks make you look heavy.
No! Let's get this straight. Wyoming has 585,000 people, and gets 2 senators and 3 electoral votes. New York has 20 million people, and gets 2 senators, and 29 electoral votes. Now that's fair, get it?!
No, no, your pose is all wrong. Please try to focus on the tusk at hand!
I think I need more light.
It's called "impressionism" wise guy... so sit still and shut the hell up.
Trust me! I may be a starving artist but I 've never eaten one of my models.
Yes I can make your tusks longer if you think it makes your eyes pop.
Calm down, this is not meant to be to scale.
This could cement your legacy.
I like it but I think you made my nose too big.
Yes, I can take out some of the wrinkles, but you're never going to look better than you do right now.
You’re not mammoth. Everyone looks ten pounds heavier in their picture.
That's it...yeah...just make love to the wall
This will remind everyone of your upcoming extinction.
This is indeed the biggest crowd to admire my art; take my word for it!

Freeze
Of course I'm not painting the tusks - you want to get poached?
I know it’s representational, but the other stuff hasn’t been invented yet.
You're the one that checked super model instead of zoo.
No tusks. Makes you look like an old cave dweller.

Ten more minutes of the big smile and I roast the peanuts.
You can put your robe back on now.
Can’t you remember yesterday’s pose?
Well, you're not exactly the Mona Lisa either.
Not another word about the length of your tusks.
And I don't need any comment from the peanut gallery either.
Derivitive? It’s mankind’s first expression of creativity!
Maybe we should try it with the robe on.

Let me see that enigmatic smile!
Nose up!

We're becoming social so I need to post you on my wall.
I hope this will get a lot of likes.
You deaf? A little to the LEFT!
Okay, now give me that sly, winsome smile.
It'll cost you a trunk load of peanuts for one tusk, or two trunk loads of peanuts for two tusks.
Ok, just freeze right there for a minute.
This is postcard size.
Almost done with selfie.
No, 'me' is not the right answer. I was looking for 'inconsiderate roommate who tramples all over the cave'.
I swear to you bro, my paintings are gonna be famous one day!
Oh now that you're closer to the light I can see the resemblance.

I know it's not very good, but I think my art is evolving.
Is mammoth spelled with two tusks or one?

Yes, stay right there. I don't have your memory.
I told you NOT to shave for your portrait. You look too evolved.
For now just freeze. You can thaw when I tell you to thaw.
I just realized that if I had emailed you a selfie then this whole prolonged agony could have been avoided!
What do you think? Did I capture your mood?
Quit criticizing and turn back to profile.
Can't you stand still ?
Now give me a wide smile, we need to show everyone what a happy life we have.
Well if you'd stop moving maybe your nose wouldn't look so big.
What, the cave adds thirty pounds
You moved hold still

Please remember that nude portraiture is all about the lighting!
It’s my own invention. I’m branding it “Chiaroscuro.”
Me never promised not to draw the elephant in the room.

Please try to look like a horse.
I'm out of burnt umber. Call it creative license.
And I remember your trunk being up.
Ok, now just turn a little to the right.
No, I don't think a second trunk would be 'funny'.
Move to the left

One more crack about ‘real art’ and I’m replacing you with an antelope.
This is what we call 'a selfie'.
If you want color, that’s the SuperSaver package, and it’ll be five piles of dung.
If you want your tusks to look bigger, maybe you should lose some of that junk in your trunk.
That’s the best you can do? It looks like an aardvark.
I'll call it: 'Woolly Mammoth Near Fire.'
A LITTLE MORE TO THE RIGHT, IT'S YOUR BETTER SIDE.

This is going to be very valuable when I'm extinct!

I'm trying for a knowing gaze with a hint of a smile
How's this for the nursery wallpaper?
People in the future are really going to appreciate that you stood still.
It’s in the tradition of primitive art - a rather vague description which refers to the cultural artifacts of ‘primitive’ peoples, those deemed to have a relatively low standard of technology.
What do you mean “you forgot”?
Just in case you go extinct, we'll have a record.
Try to look more 2-dimensional.

That is so pleistocene era, but let's stay with it.

I'm telling you, the MOMA will accept this!
It’s proportional to your brain, pal.
You're forgetting too many details.
"All those paint-by-stones" have really paid off.
What else did he look like?
You models are all alike! The last person I painted wanted his ears smaller and now you want them bigger. You all have no sense of what artistic integrity is.
Pirouette please. It's a profile, not a portrait.
It looks nothing like you?? Ahh, you're off the wall!
What do you want? You're paying me in peanuts.
I've been painting so long my hand is Thor.

Don't be so sensitive! I'm sure lots of she-elephants like a bull with a little junk in the trunk.
Remember, this one's for posterity.
What? It's called "Outsider Art."
Maybe a little less junk in the trunk?
No Don, your trunk is not bigger, and no, this is not fake news.
OK, check this out: We use your fossil, then we make petroleum products and and BOOM! we're all stinking rich!
I'm not including the tusks because it suggest violence in and among species.

I don't care if you remember it going down differently, I am an impressionist!
I airbrushed out the fat.
No, it’s POST-primitivism.
Your confidence in your beautifully ample body is so refreshing, Babarella! Most of my models are so self-conscious about not having that “perfect pachyderm” look, they constantly fidget. A bit more trunk, please. Excellent!
Hold still will ya? Your future reputation depends on this!
OK I'll finish it before you become extinct
Did you move?
Work with me here. Sexy! Sultry! That all you got?
Forget about more lifelike--I'm not messing with art history.

I've told Og a hundred times, we need a written language! If he thinks it's that easy, let him sketch the dinner menu!
What do you expect? This fire won't last forever.
Images appear larger in the rear view mirror.
Now smile !!
It's called artistic license!
If I get the tusks right, will you let me go?
Again? OK, just make sure you flush after you're finished!
All my friends make me look at pictures of their food...just returning the favor.
Let's get crazy.
Hey! I can only do so much with shrinking the junk in your trunk
if you don’t like it, just be glad I’m not a cubist!
Ok, I get the point.
No, I am not minimizing your importance; I'm just trying to give it some depth by making it look like you are standing back a few feet.

Trust me, I’m painting as you will become.
I love how it makes my tush look so small...
In 100,000 years this will be priceless!
My right tusk isn't that big in person, is it?"
I said " Don't move! "
Full face or profile?
In about a million years this will be known as a “selfie.”
So you see, you are an elephant and I am not. It's just not going to work
Hey, if you have a complaint, tell it to Plato.
Hey, I dialed back the overbite, but baby-blue eyes is going too far.
You maybe extinct next week but art lasts forever
What part of "forgive and forget" don't you understand?
It's the tusks. They're always difficult.
Lift your trunk up, please.
I want to capture your playful side.
Stay. I said - Stay!
If you don't mind I am going to make your ears larger.
Vim. Give me more vim.
No, I do not need glasses !
Closer... closer...
It's a dating wall. Chicks today don't dig big tusks.
Stand still! This will be frozen in time long before you're frozen in ice!

Rembrandt's Early Work
Hold that nose, I mean pose.
If you lift your head up slightly you’ll look younger
Aye, a photographic memeory wouldn't be out of line.
Might as well make me look good without the tusks.
Its not my fault, lose a couple pounds!
Please turn left and face the opening, I'm trying to do a profile.
Is this for your wife?
My wife said I can only color in my man cave.
I know it makes you look like a coward. Don't worry--no one will recognize you in a million years.
Trust me, the left side is your best profile.
Oh well, it's the thrill you'll never know! We can't all be on the cover of the Rolling Stone.
“Yes, I’m sure this is your ‘good side’”.
And I'm telling you it IS your best side.
Could you please manage a more enigmatic smile?
No, I don't think lefties will die out before you do.
Don't gore the messenger, you've gained a few pounds.
This drawing will be no small tusk.
Don't worry, the cave adds 10 pounds.
So knock it off with the "Tsk, Tsk," stuff already! I'm just getting ready to add the tusks.
Hold still.this for your future budies Hold still this for the next generation.
Hold still, you'll end up looking like an emu.
OK, next time I'll draw you en plein air
I ain't no Leonardo? Well, you ain't exactly Madam Giocondo either, wise guy.
You might remember everyting, but I don't.
I said like one of your French girls...
Now give me angry eyes…ANGRY EYES! Yes!! YES!!
I want you to draw me like one of your woolly girls ...
I'm telling you, your nose is like this.
Look, it’s a stylistic choice. It’s not supposed to be realistic.
Thanks for shaving. You're a trend setter baby!
Who knew this Paleolithic figure drawing class would be so...authentic. Last time I use Groupon!
An elephant never forgets, but I get the one who needs to study....
I'm sorry, but the lighting in here is very primitive.
As a matter of fact I do know in Alabama the Tuscaloosa.
Hold that pose! You never know, one day this may be the only way anyone can see an elephant.
You haven't the temperament to be an artist and it would be hell to take off one of those ears.
Cheese, just say it.
I'm serious, just keep it up 'til I'm done
That's how art works Al, no one buys it 'til you're extinct!
Downsizing does not get it. I am just saying.
Hurry up! I can feel myself fossilising
You will thank me 10.000 years from now.....
Doth peanut gallery patron, protest?
Hold that pose. This is going to be a real work of art.
You’ll do until a cuter quadruped evolves.
Show me where he touched you.
Werner’s gonna love this!
You should model for a political party!!
Of course, we'll share the proceeds. You get all the peanuts.

Thanks for stopping by, but I need to report what I saw.
I'm thinking Smithsonian.
Stop the whining, already. You’ll thank me in 100,000 years!
No, making your tusks bigger is not going to make you look slimmer.
Look- It's not my fault you lost all that hair.
Hold still and behave--this is the Introduction to Art History!
Is there an "f" in elephant?
I told you to get my good side.
I don't think I will be able to draw the thing that happens next.
To go or namaste?
Your nose is that big! I will not sacrifice my artistic realism for your vanity.
Hold still! You might remember me, but I won’t remember you!
You'll look best in ivory.
Whatdya mean it isn’t realistic!
I can only draw what I see. You ARE big and hairy.
I am not going to draw any happy trees, so just stop asking!
It's permanent paint that lasts for ages no need to carve in stone !
Did I portray too much junk in your trunk?
Dumbo, you're blocking the light with your trunk.
Stand still!
You control your privacy settings.
I'm sorry it doesn't look like you, but I've only taken the one class.
Can you lift up your leg? I want to anatomically correct here.
You seem unmoved by my first amendment defense.
You asked for it sans tusks... remember?
I know. I'm not done yet.
Think of it as evolving, not balding
I’ve evolved to working with plus-sized models.
Pay me a honking big commission, then you'll get honking big tusks.
Your memory skills may be impeccable, but your storytelling skills are a little lacking.
Have you had tusk augmentations?
This is the worst portrait he's done of me yet.
Can you please stand still? This is a new form of art.
I'd do linear perspective, but it's just so Renaissance.
Oh, come on ... SMILE!
Now try to remember....one day you will become the great mascot for a herd of dinosaurs!
OK, now hold your trunk high over your tusks.
So what if I got your trunk wrong! In 20,000 years, no ones gonna care.
You think you're so smart. Why didn't you finish it?
Hold still! I’m just about done...
Hold still. I need five more minutes.
Don't move
"You know, when I model at the other class they pay me 7bucks an hour".
Did you have braces as a kid? Those tusks are perfect! Or are they crowns?
I don’t know how to spell that!
You are so photogenic
No, I can't draw this cave wall picture on the side of a milk carton...hello...Pleistocene!
There's just so much photoshopping I can do!
Don't look at me that way; I'm still learning
Don't move! Fantastic! That's just the image we republicans have been looking for.
I call it "art", and it's not supposed to be life-size!
I said “Freeze!”
Oh no, the mammoth has photo-bombed the family portrait again!
So far I’ve got woolly hair and mammoth build. Do you remember any other details?
I've seen asses hold a better position.
Believe me. This painting will be here long after you're gone.
Give me a more 'Whither the mammoth?'expression.
He who smelt it, dealt it.
For the last time, no - this is not the menu!
I’ll leave out the tusks so the poachers won’t recognize you.
Could you please quit flapping your ears for just 5 minutes?
It is you, just without that toothy grin.
Hey, can you hurry up? I don't have all Stone Age!
Helga, bring me a #2 sable brush
Draw me like one of your french mammoths.
Does this make you look too fat?
No! Your other trunk.
Not mammoth enough for you?
Don't worry. I'll make sure I add the tusks.
Enough about "Zendak's technique!" - I'm paying you to model, not critique.
Relax. Keeping it small increases the chance that a future political entity will adopt it as their icon, and you'll be immortalized as as a symbol of any wisdom and largesse they lay claim to.
Putting circular tusk on you just for ha ha's.
Don't worry I won't make you look fat.
Now, all you have to do is think of a funny caption.
Admittedly, this play would work better if the rest of the team hadn't gone extinct.
Can you lower those tusks a bit
Cavemansplaining
No, I’m not drawing your trunk three inches longer.
Please stay still and stop waiving your trunk!
You're nearly extinct, Dude, so I'm doing a wall book, 'What Happened," in the hope some future politician doesn't make the same mistakes.
So you think anteaters should be the Republican mascot when all elephants are dead?
It's not supposed to be you!
Now it's my turn.
The sabar-toothed tiger didn't complain about remaining in one position for an hour."
This is ONE Mastodon, ONE!
I can see you're dyslexic
No, there is no one with experience.
This is my new studio, you're the first.
And you'll look grumpy in all of them! I call them "memoths".
That looks like my father.
Tusks are too hard to draw.
Oh, look who's got jokes! You're not going extinct that fast!
Thanks. That’s all I need, -the art critic in the room !
Let’s make your trunk a little bigger.
Whadya mean you forgot I taught you how to read!?!
Hold still about another half hour and no you don't have to bare your "Genitals"
Because your descendants are liable to be gone in a few million years.
It's the thought that counts.
Come on, smile!
It doesn't make you look fat, it captures the essential nature of being mammoth.
You're fired!
You'll be the first pet people see in the first photo album.
Just be patient. I'll get to the tusks later.
Tusk, Tusk, Tusk!
I know your tusks are heavy, but keep your bloody head up or you'll look like a cheap ashtray!!
I prefer abstract art but my wife wants an animal motif.
Didn't you say you never forget?
Bigger tits?
Sorry. I like you as my model, but I just can’t see you as my muse.
What'dya mean your trunk doesn't look right?
For someone who never forgets, you never remember to hold still!
You don’t look like your dating profile picture.
Do you have an eraser I can borrow?
I’m sure I won’t get the credit but I’m calling it “paleoinformographics” and it will be on cave walls everywhere soon.
Well,...its an abstraction of reality that helps viewers better see reality.
How many times have I told you Larry, I will not draw nudes!!!!
Are you sure this is your best side?
Stand still or you won’t get any peanuts
Stand still, or posterity won't recognize you!
Next time I'm going with a younger model. You're getting a bit long in the tooth.
Tilt the left tusk up a bit
Come on, you look so Pleistocene. Trunk up!
What? It's like looking in a mirror.
You are my muse.
Look, no horns, she is perfect for you!
We're playing 'Pin the tusks on the Mammoth' later.
Swipe left?
Thanks for posing for my painting. Men will know just what you look like for many moons to come.
Please don't move, Ethel!
Tsk, tsk!
No, I'm not going to eat you afterward; now would you hold still?
I cannot give you a copy.
If you don’t like how the Campfire Portrait Mode is turning out, we will have to wait until morning to try Sunrise Portrait Mode.
Oh all right, how can you tell when an elephant has been in the ice cave?
Long walks on the beach? No, let's try to keep your profile credible.
If they look from the side they can see your smile
Tired?! I thought you were 'the fittest.'
Trunk back up, please.
Now turn for your next scene in 'Mammoth Masterpiece'.
Do you know the left eye is bigger than the right?
When we are able to mix more paint I can draw a larger image. But for now, he's the little elephant on the cave wall, and you're the big elephant in the room.
So I'm left handed, so what?
Go somewhere else! I don't do life sizes!
With global warming on the horizon, this will be your ancestor!
It's pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre pre-modern
Stop fidgeting! You’re messing me up!
Someday you'll be renowned as 'The Elephant In The Cave.'
Relax. This is modern art, ok? It's interpretive.
Try the sitting pose next.
Hold still - in 40,000 years you may end up in The New Yorker.
Just in case you go extinct
Truthfully, what I'd really like to do is direct."
How am I supposed to capture your essence in these primitive work conditions?
Yeah, I know, but it's hard to do because they only make these walls for right handed artists.
I was born in the wrong era, painting fruits is more my style
Stay still or no peanuts.
Make the tusks look bigger? Seems like a mammoth might be overcompensating for something. But that's evolution for you...
Yeah, I went to art school.
Do we have to do the wedding pictures now?
Your turn. I hold spear.
Just think, in 10,000 years you'll be priceless.
Don't worry about the missing tusks, no one will care in a million years!
You’ll be bigger in next week’s tweet.
You agent didn't tell you? This is for the menu.
Are you going to remember this?
Primitive art exhibits pretty much always ended with a barbecue.
Early Pictionary
Today’s lesson is about going into labor. Take several deep breaths and push hard. And, voila, before you know it, this is what you’ll see. Any questions?
But if I don't paint it in the middle of the cave, no one will notice it!
I promise I'll be done in 10.
I'm trying for a very contemporary take on prehistory.
I'm almost done. So how soon do you lower my taxes?
That way, if you die in a mass extinction, people will still know what mammoths looked like.
I know, my human inferiority complex may have weighed in on it a little...
Ok, I’ve heard of you, the mastodon in the room
What? And you’ve used artificial lighting before?
What? Think you can do better?
You can go to the river to cool off, when I am done.
Let's look a little more perky. This mammoth sitting is just about over.
Is this drawing unforgettable or what?
No, give me bigger tusks.
I'm gonna be waiting here for a thousand years before this guy figures out how to paint with any perspective.
The stone adds 10 pounds
Will you stand still? I'm trying to capture your trunk.
Well, of course, I’m going to fix your teeth.
Keep your trunk straight your letting it droop again.
With or without tusks.
Your password is?
Don't look so glum. It is the best I can do under these conditions.
Two bananas an hour when the Lascaux models got one?
Payment in advance in case one of us goes extinct.
Can't you wait till I finish to have a look.
Can you add some hair? I'm not as woolly as I used to be.
Hey, I told you, turn to the side.
Hold still so that I can capture the fire light in your eyes.
CARVED IN STONE
No, it's not time yet for a peanut break.
Get it up and SMILE!
Don't worry, I'll get your good side.
I know I'm supposed to keep a record of our daily life, but choices for an emotional support animal are getting ridiculous.
Give me more! Make love to the cave wall!
If you want a good portrait, I need you to stay frozen for as long as you can.
Lift up your trunk
For the last time, it does not make your legs look fat.
Haters will say it’s photoshop.
"It's an expression of the inner you.
I’m really sorry. I meant to say painting, not menu.
Can you at least photoshop my nose?

Draw me like one of your *woolly* mammoths.
T*sk, t*sk. Not mammoth enough for you?
That's okay, I guess, but can you give me wistful, with a hint of melancholy.
I'll never forget you are mans' best friend.
It's my interpretation so just forget about it.

It's a miniature, not a shrew.
Because I’m out of frigging gray, that’s why!

Swipe left?
Technically, it's not a "selfie" if someone else does it.

You may be my muse..... but please stand still!
...Don't try anything stupid pal, you're being recorded.
You could at least snarl a bit for me!
No! You can’t take another potty break.
No, I'm not going to include the tusks... they'll ruin the image. And besides, evolution will eliminate them over time...
No this is not going to be to scale as we are both running out of time here
No, no - I don't just love you for your tusks!
Oh, the things I will do for affordable housing!
Why the long face?
I'm myopic, I see you as big from far but far from big!
You're still the only elephant in the cave!
"Mastadonia For The Mastadons?" What kind of campaign am I working for, here?

Little Marco Rubio, 2016 A.D.
Just who do you think is going to expropriate your image?

Can you roast a few more peanuts. This work is tiring.
Paint me like one of your éléphants.
... and head a little more to the right, please.

Course it's passport approved. Biometric, innit?
I'm adding hair, you'll look better.
Don't look at me like that! What do you expect from charcoal?
Well where do you suggest I take art lessons then?!
If you want an impressionist version, go see Vlad!
You don't have a good side ("have" italicized)
So it's not representational! In 5000 years the critics will love it.
Stop blinking- you're ruining the picture.
Don’t gimme that look! Nobody wants to see an elephant with prehensile dysfunction.
No, it's called your "trunk," not your "junk.
I'm into downsizing!
I assumed that you would be flattered being included in my epic hunting story.
Be excited. Your likeness will live on in representing humanity’s shared political views at this point in time.
I told my father, artists are never fully appreciated until they’re long gone anyway.
What?! The cave wall adds ten pounds.
I thought you said that was your good side.

Finally! If I waited any longer I would be extinct by now!
Please keep your tusks still.
Umm- Sorry, but you made my tusks too small.

Am I high or are you?
I have to do it this way because we haven't invented mirrors yet!
Keep still! Yes some elephants are white elephants
This is the Pleistocene era, you're extinct, bitch.
Hold still. I need to capture this on my wall. My friends will never believe how mammoth you were.
Hold still, god damn it!
I’m tired of your inaction. I can’t wait for the donkey to evolve.
Please just the truncated version.
Is 'an elephant joke in the room' too meta?
Sexier!
Maybe I should try Abstract Expressionism.
Would it kill you to turn left?
What do you mean it's too small? It'll look bigger if you get closer!
No, I will not make your trunk petite.
I know, I know, I'm a hard tusk master.

I'm tuckered out! Besides you're paying me peanuts!
Don't worry. I only hunt mastadons in Alabama. The tuskaloosa there.
I'm worried about you, there's a whole world out there and you're starting to replicate reality.
Your bones will be the historical record. This is just a meme.
Trunk up and smile!
I told you i’m not adding a flower crown filter
Can't you give me a little smile?

It's your best side, that's why.
How, “self-aware”, can you be if you don’t think this looks like you?
Don't worry, I'm sure your grandparents had tusks too.
How about a Mona Lisa smile.
Canvas? I am not creating art to be found in the future.
Do you think the archaeologists will like Pictionary, too?
This is history in the making.
You are going to be famous one day
No, I'm not naming it after you, Rodney. All my works are untitled.

I know it's not life size, I'm trying to save wall space.
Lay off! Ouk of the Forest Tribe didn't even sell his first cave painting until 35, ya know.
No! I will NOT hand you the brush! I'm the artist! You're the subject. Now stand still and quit complaining!

Your left side IS your good side.
This recipe guarantees longevity
Almost done. What’s your twitter handle?
"Honey...Don't move.
This means "Republican". It's how we got here. It's why you're unpopular.
Stand still and quit complaining! I told you this would be a mammoth operation!
Hopefully this is simple enough -- the folks you're going to represent need simplicity or they get fussy, make rash decisions, vote angry red balloons with wigs into office... now, what ARE you?
When the mammoths commission the work, the mammoths can chase the hunters.
You're NOT Neanderthal, you're mammoth, and you look like this

I promise. We won’t change a thing.
Gary's painting with merlot class was about to go from bad to worse.

Is that you're best side.

Slimmer around the edges big guy
You’re a ‘Wooly Mammoth’, so please play the part and show me some action.
Profile please.
Until your memory improves, we will be using pictures.
We do not have forever to do this please try to hold still.
Well, I'm trying not to make you look fatter!
For the neanderthals I need to know: are you a mammoth, mastodon, or just an elephant?
Regardless of what you think, in 30,000 years, people will be awed.
I’m trying to capture your good side.
)Well then, why don't you draw it yourself?
Hold still Ralph; this'll help teach the kids about the pre-nuke republican party.
No, I'm not going to paint your tusks on this cave drawing. When I'm finished I'm going to politely ask you to extract them while I call the ivory traders, and no one will be the wiser.
I can try to make your tusks look a bit smaller but, I’ll need to use a lot of green in the background.
This isn't the easiest medium, you know.
Now, what color are her eyes?
Objects on wall are closer than they appear
Sorry, I'm looking for a little less wooly a little less mammoth

This mud only makes gray paint. I don’t have ivory.
I've finished the mammoth. Now send in the guys with spears.
Some day, in the future, tourists in what will be called France, will see your picture and you will be famous.
It's not a caricature. It's a profile in courage against all odds. Note the majesty and the sleek lines. Nothing about extinction.
You have to use your imagination...
you'll never be an icon with that nose...
Could you just forget about this year? I’ll remember next Valentines... It’s written in stone!
One day, someone will want to recreate you.
Well I'm sorry that you're upset, but I heard that firelight was flattering.
Honey, I'm really busy here, would you clean Dumbo's litter box?!
This is you, a century ago.

My painting is evolving into an abstract!
Draw me like one of your French girls.
Here's a good fundraising idea- how about you paint?
OK, I'm an impressionist. So sue me.
If you mention the size of the tusks again, I'm going to turn it into a labradoodle.
I am not trying to make you look fat.
Damn it, keep moving and guess who's next on the Endangered Species List
Can you at least remember to remain still?
No! I said: Famous Movie...
Don't sneeze!
Enigmatic! An enigmatic smile!
Frankly, I think referring to it as "naivist" is condescending.
Yes, it is a mammoth task. Hey, wait a minute....
No, just a little to the left.
Hold it right there while rough in your tusks.
Now take your pants off.
Still Lisa, still!
If this catches on we'll both be working for peanuts!

They may be your pride, but this is my impression; so roll up that trunk and stop complaining.
Sorry, I can only paint well when the models are nude.
I'm paying you 30 pounds of tree bark an hour, so stand still!
You should really learn to paint a selfie.
Modeling fee? Forget about it!
If I make you look hansdome do you promise not to use those on me?
Yes, officer, THAT looks like the one who stole my private horde of Serengeti native grasses.
NO, it's not your daughter!
Damn it, Kevin. A little to the left, your trunk looks horrendous with this angle!
Relax, I'm learning miniatures in drawing class.
Someday Org be famous for making political party logo...
Good. Don''t smile. But do pretend there are five of me and we all have sharp spears.
Can you at least try to look ferocious? I'm trying to keep you from becoming a circus act 10,000 years from now...
Ohhh, you wanted to be painted in Mugshot view.
Please....hold still!
In a nutshell this is what you'll need to avoid extinction.
Do you think you could smile just once!
He says his name is Dumbo and claims to be from the future
I know an elephant never forgets.
Stop pointing those things at me, I DID make your nose look smaller...
When I've finished, how bout we get one without those tusks?
I've only got one color; blood [ouch!] red.
What do you mean -- it makes you too fat?
I may have stoked the flame, but you're hornier than I remembered.
Believe me, it's your best side.
Beginning or End of GOP?
It's not my fault, perspective won't be invented for thousands of years.
I know you're a very special, best ever, larger than life chipmunk, but there's no way I'm gonna draw you full scale!
I know it's small Ellie, but one day, they'll name all the sizes after you!
Don’t look at me like that, whoever finds this painting would not care you if you were domesticated or not.
Now—see the difference? You CAN’T mount this one!!
If I was a caricaturist, your tusks would be ginormous!
If this is going to sell, I'm going to need the back view, too.
Your art is fantastic. Let's plan a mammoth opening!
...and I say it is your best profile!
Hold still, I don't have all day!
No, those tusks don't make you look fat.
If you keep making that face it just might get stuck like that.
Don't you understand anything about artistic license?
Turn a little to the left, please, so I can see more of that fire in your eyes!
Next, I’ll add some happy little clouds.
Don't get bent out of shape. I'm just following orders!
Hold that smile.
Do you want it with or without an enigmatic smile?
Please stand still.
Don't laugh. I'm having a trunk show in the fall.
I wouldn't have to do this if you didn't eat my iPhone!"
I know it's freezing in here; we'll be done soon.

Let's try a Snapchat filter, shall we? Put a little fun in it. Hey, it could sell more tickets, yes?
Will you please stand still!
I know I am no Michelangelo. But this is for eternity - do you know what I mean?
Stop shivering!
For the last time, keep still... And don't you even think about hosing down our light source.
Gerald, do I really look like that?
When did you come from?
Make a quarter turn. Portrait perspective not invented yet.
Try to look a little more pensive.

Please stand still. I hired you for your patience, not your looks.
Try not to move.
Bad boy! No tusking the walls
Listen, if you do't do this right, you will become extinct!
Don't worry, it'll wash off.
It would take a mammoth effort, but afterwards you would look years younger.
I hope you're not allergic to puffy paint.
stop flapping your ears already!
You’re about 18 centuries too early for Realism.
Turn just a bit to your right, please.
Give me that 'sexy thing' smile with more tooth, sweetheart! Hold it!

You were perfect 8 lbs heavier. Don't diet for my sake.
Sideways on please. I want to do your profile.
You look gorgeous, but if it makes you feel better, I'll add a nice woolly coat.
C’mon, we have to show strength — just hold up your trunk.
I prefer my models to be naked, not wooly.
Don't look so wimpy! I told you keep the snout up!!!
Don’t forget to draw my tusks.
Your tusks look better in profile.

Pffft...why can't I get this right?
It's not you. The chisel adds ten pounds.
That's right. Keep your eyes on me Rose.
Our luck this will be worth millions only AFTER we die.
So now everyone's an art critic

Makeup has done a great job; when they defrost you, you'll still look terrific.
COULD YOU AT LEAST SMILE FOR ME??
Because perspective hasn't been invented yet.
If you don't like it, just take a selfie for your Tinder account.
Are you sure you aren't forgetting any details about the perpetrator?
Oh, I suppose, like you could do better!
What do you mean I've captured a remarkable example of modern art?
I will show it at First Friday.
Great! Now give me a pouty look.
This will provide an historic record in case you go extinct.
You're right. Your sharp and real tusks cancel out my artistic license.
Pre-historic police sketch artist
The time you finish that drawing, I'll be extinct.
Extinction can be proven.

And now for some happy trees and bushes.
Well, I think it looks just fine and, no, I don't think it makes your face look small.
Yes, it makes you look fat now. Relax; I can CharcoalShop it later.
Trust me - size doesn't matter.
I told you I am out of heather slate! And yes, I agree we lose some of the elusive tension, but the weathered charcoal offers a more spontaneous--if fleeting--supple and delicate rendering.
Stop laughing! How do you expect me to draw you while you are laughing?!
Yes, yes, I realize. Felt the poetic license was kosher.
Size always matters
Permanent ink? It'll all be a wash in 1,000 years, the whole 'elephant in the room' thing.

This is what your ancestors looked like, before digging through deep political mire was necessary.
I thought I told you to stand still!
I know it doesn’t look much like you but, have seen the light with I’m working here?
Well then YOU try and paint it more life-like, Humphrey!
May you never be forgotten, dear Wooly!
I’ll paint you abstract with long flowing hair to baffle future generations.
Are you sure that's your good tusk side?
You have little ears, the last guy had little fingers.
But a show and dinner just doesn't have the same ring to it.
Sorry about this. Humankind hasn't invented the Artistic License yet.
Wait. Wait. I'll make it bigger before you eat me
It'll be worth something when I'm dead.

Stand Still Or We'll Eat You.
Hold still, I'm trying to paint you like one of my French girls.
Stop complaining. The paintbrush always adds a hundred pounds.
Quit staring...I know it needs the tusks and sunset.
Next session, I'll explain all about vanishing point.
I'm sorry, I'll have to charge you for another hour of modeling. I'm the breadwinner in our family.
You are making me look too thin!
Let's agree that this is your best side.
Why do you draw a picture of me when knowledge stands before you?
Ivy, and maybe some flowers.
It's more Warthog than Warhol.
Oh stop being so picky! I have put my blood, sweat, and tears into this. Literally!
I want your side profile!
Could you move your head a little to the left?
Did you want the tusks longer, or shorter?
Quit pouting, she'll be back.
Look, I'm losing my light. This isn't easy for me you know. Don't exhale on my neck like that pleeeeeeze, it's distracting.
Last chance. Are you sure you want to be portrayed as tusk-less?
Please do not move. I need to get the tusks right.
Hold still. I want to make it where the tusks always follow you.
Hold still. This is gonna kill at the office.
Some call it purgatory. We call it coworking.
Take off your fur.
Stop whining, you aren't drawn so good yourself.
It's better to start with a simple profile. An en-face with the perspective you want will take ages to finish...
If I have to paint over your graffiti one more time, I don’t care how close to extinction your species is, you’re outta here!
I know how proud you are of your tusks... but I'm all out of paint
In this light you look a lot smaller.
Welcome to my trunk show
Turn to the right. This is a campaign poster.
Please raise your hand if you have a question.
The chart looks prehistoric, but the returns are really good.
"Hey, look! It's me!
It must be my lucky day. I can cross "Mammoth" off my groceries list!
I do accept ivory but there's a 2% surcharge.
Hold still, this lighting really suits you.
You’re from Tuskany and he’s from Nontusket.
blood or no blood on the tusks?
I appreciate your letting me share your cave and fire. In exchange ... I'll paint you what we're calling a "Selfie".
Hold still now...I'm try to get the tusks right!
This filter is better.
You have a good memory. It points to the outhouse. Now remember it
You look so cute in your baby pictograph, but you’re overdue for an update.
If you keep moving, you're going straight back to the glacier I found you in.
Jiminy Christmas do it when I'm making the picture okay?!!
Maybe a little less smile.
Hold the fuck still!
Look, this is harder than you think. Next time we'll switch positions.
Lay off me! It's just a draft, no one will ever see it.
Ok Waldo, for the 100th time, this is a profile portrait!
Shut Up, that's a spitting image of you.
Who is this french girl that you speak of?
A very early example of a portrait artist being told what to do.
Hold that trunk.
yeah dude im telling you. she looked exactly like this man. and we got it the fuck on dude. yeah, her trunk was really that big bro, no lie.
Please keep still, I ran out of peanuts.
Try to look beatific, and stand still!
Hurry up and choose your metaphor--elephant in the room or Plato's cave.
You say you have a better way to mark your territory?
Think of it as an MRI confirming your pregnancy.
Am I too late for high tea?
For the 2/5/2018 magazine (not drawing above): Hikers looking for solitude usually avoid the peak. Descend a few hundred feet where the signal's not so strong.
Grog like drawing. Writing a winning caption take ten thousand moons.
....just try to smile in a more enigmatic way
Stop the whining, I just invented fire and wall-art, you have nothing to be petrified about!
Stand still, I don't get paid by the eon.
And what pray tell are you doing to memorialize me?
No, really, the charcoal add about 20 pounds to the image.
Paint me with my trunks on - only my trunks.  I want you to draw me like one of your cave girls. Wearing trunks... Wearing "only" trunks.
Drawing you for the hall of fame.. don't tilt your chin
What's a registered trunk cave mark?
The painting? THAT they will talk about.
Don't worry. I'll make your tusks longer.
Can you make me look ten years younger before I put on all this weight?
Given we're all about to be fossilized I hate to ask, but could you be a lamb and just sit still?
The tusks won't make you look fat, trust me.
I'm not finished with the tusks, jerk.
Stop complaining about the proportions or I'll make this a Pollock.
No, I did not make you look fat.
I'm not trying to make your trunk look long.
I told you - it's called Neorealism.
Hey, I'm doing my best to make you beautiful.
Really? You can't pose with your trunk up for the five seconds this will take to draw?
Smile, damnit
Shall we offer a reward too?
Immortalized so your progeny will forever gaze upon your likeness!
I'm painting your baby ok. You're making me nervous.
Of course it will work, but be sure to come back if it lasts more than eight hours.
I need you to hold that pose.
Don't worry it's a cave painting. No one is ever going to see it. Now give me that little pouty face.
Give me that come hither look!
It's not photorealism, but here's your baby picture.
I'm sick of calling this my studio; from now on it's a living room.
Elephantiasis my butt, Martha. You just need to take your Weight Watchers membership more seriously!
Ok, just a few more minutes and then you can do your fire dance.
No ! No third tusk.
People like body parts to look more "lifted" in pictures, that's why.
I just wanted something to remember you by.
It may not look like you as I only studied still prehistoric life.
Oh, you are being too kind. You are drawing me before I hit that One Ton mark and before all my wrinkles.
Pre-modernism.
Everyone's a critic. No one understands art.
Ivory much doubt you'll be disappointed!
The working title is 'Elephant in the Cave,' which I think is catchy, don't you?
How do you expect to make it in modeling if you can't hold still for 30 consecutive seconds?
I never claimed to be a professional.
Plato's cave is showing its corruption!
Does my nose look too big?
I just need to add a few stars and we'll have a perfect 'way out' sign.
The first #nofilter selfie
I’ll waive your sitting fee if you add the tusk whitening.
No, I don't mean it's actually you. It represents you.
This will be priceless in a few millennia.
Quit facing me! I only do profiles!
The purity of art will never allow for animals to be depicted wearing clothing.
I feel like the tusks are going to be a problem.
Could you make me look a little slimmer?
All I have to say is "tsk tsk."
Fabulous... now show me a bit more pout
If we finish it tonight, they'll add it onto the software update tomorrow.
In 10,000 years, people will believe that the elephants had woolly fur.
Yes, yes already. I will scale my own figure proportionately!
What do you mean your abs don't look chiseled?
Do you realize you may go down in history.
No I didn't say you look fat!
Will you stop swaying !
ya gotta hold still man !
Stop that "limp hose" act, okay?
Its called a selfie.
Hold still. I am not done with your portrait yet.
"I promise I won't make you look fat".
Drawing from life ...
The unicorn couldn't make it to the sitting. You'll have to do. Like anyone is going to care 10000 years from now.
Tusk tusk, feeding time so soon? Sorry, I meant Tsk, Tsk.
The G is silent, Mastadong
Tomorrow we'll work on your other end.
Make love to paint brush.
Perhaps you think I'm an art-vaark?
I’m not exaggerating ... you DO have a mammoth nose!
I know, but you don't get fed until the posing is finished....
Stop fidgeting!
This could be your lucky break - I can see a renaming of Pantone color 408 in it for you
It'll look better when it drys !
Don’t worry—these paints are guaranteed to shave off ten pounds and 10,000 years.
Work it! Work it!
I've sent a smoke signal to your mahout to tell him your portrait is finished!
Hold still, I'm snapchat-ing this to my story!
Don't even ask me about the saber-toothed tiger sitting...
Yes, I know, there is something wrong about the mouth.
Can I leave out the part about Martians? I am bad at drawing Martians.
Why are there men with spears behind me?" "No reason.
I can reduce the size of your tusks and lift the trunk, but we might want to consider botox to take care of the crow's feet...
Now Mona. give me that quizzical smile of yours!
Now are we swiping left or right on this one?
„No, you don‘t look fat.“
I'm calling it perspective.
Please hold that pose
NOW you tell me it's your bad side?
When she stormed out, she said something about an elephant in the room, right?
When the prosecutor asks if this was the perpetrator please don't make that joke about your being forgetful.
OK, head a little to the left.
Hold that pose! I'm just starting to work on your ivory smile.
I wish I had a photographic memory; taming a Mammoth made me an old man.
I didn't like your mom either, but Grog requested it.
For the third time I tell you. This is not a dog!
Now turn a bit more left to your good side.
I don’t care if I lose my security deposit.
If you don't hold still, no more peanuts!
They’re going to remember you, Karl.
This is good peyote.
Just a little retouching to update your look - whadaya think?
Okay, I'll give you 2 more clues - it's gray and much larger in real life...
Try to look more, I dunno, 'rampagey.'
Sorry, but the mural doesn't lie
Let's try a little less "mastodon," a little more "mammoth."
You're just not relatable at that size.
Remember, the portrait adds 10 pounds.
Sorry. I just don't do crusty gray skin.
I’m having trouble reproducing your inscrutable smile.
I realize that this may be my only shot, but do you really think this can possibly fool Noah?
I still don't think this is your good side.
So tell me a little about your family. Were you your mother's favorite?
I swear, one of us is going to become extinct by the time I get you to pose like I asked you to!
Maybe I should just draw a picture of a room instead.
Profile! Profile! Look out of the cave!
Which is your chocolate side?
Looking good! Now hold that pose for just a few more days.
Just hold still...
So we build a wall, to keep these guys out!
Take a picture why don't you.
Carrots, onion, and what else?
Hold still. Make sure not to wiggle your trunk! Hieroglyphics is a lost art, that requires patience.
If you stay still and let me finish, everyone will want one of these in their room.
Hold it. Beautiful. They'll all be vegans in no time.
With this lighting no wonder it will take me 2,000 years to draw 3D
I'll draw you like I draw my French elephants.
You may not think it’s art, but at least it’s original.
What, was I going to ignore you?
Now turn...and we'll do your other side.
I can’t capture your essence for future generations if you refuse to hold a pose.
Dang it! Forgot a toe!
You want realism? Pose for Norman Rockwell!
for the rest of time, when people hear the name "Mona", they'll think of this painting, and you.
What is that yellow, flickering thing burning my trunk?
EARLIEST KNOWN DMV PICTURE
I just thought we should all put on our big-boy hides and address the elephant in the room, you know?
I'm not getting paid for this either, so shut up!
OK. Now, you're on the defensive line........
Now to add something Emma Allen will think is funny.
Now be still for ten minutes, will you?
I also do Bar Mitzvahs
What do you expect? I'm no Michaelangelo.
I made a balloon elephant, but they hunted it because it wasn't considered original.
No, it does not make your butt look fat.
Just take it off; no one but me is going to see this anyway!
Does "Master Don's Masto-Piece" sound too braggy?
Why do you keep on about the recipe?
If you don't stand still, I'll put more hair all over you.
Just bamboozling ivory hunters.
Now I just have to wait another 50,000,000 years to submit it to an art contest.
Quit holding still!
Give me more tusk and less trunk.
You could be next to the Mona Lisa.
Do you have a better idea for allowing your species to be revived in the future?
Well it was going to be a buddy picture, but now I’m thinking slasher, horror.
Derivative of whom?!
Good job, just stand still a little bit longer...
It lacks a human element.
Don't worry..........you'll be famous around 2 million years later!
“This is your best option—a photograph can add up to 10 pounds.
Fire now hieroglyphics—what can future generations come up with to top that?
Sorry, but the cave wall adds 10 pounds.
Smile ambiguously.
Hold still! I want to capture your eyes perfectly!
How do you expect me to render you properly if you keep forgetting to bring enough firewood?
Is this the nude model drawing class?
Hold still! I'd like to finish before you go extinct!
I realize you're working for peanuts, but that's the third time you've missed that pile of sand I put under your tail!
Would you hold still?! I'm expecting a showing any millennium now.
This is what your supposed to have sex with, not me.
Look, Dumbo, it'll make you a star for the ages.
Primitive art rocks!
Feel free to take a break and stretch--on second thought, don't.
Let's keep it white... you'll be revered by the King of Siam
it's about time someone finally forced the conversation about the mastadon in the middle of the room ...
Seriously
I told you to diet in order to be on the cover of Cavity Fair. Now, we had to cast somebody else.
Stop kvetching!
It's called Photoshopping.
The wife says that skiing holidays are all the rage this year, but I think it's just a fad.
Please don't make me look so darn fat this time!
I'm just doing this to baffle people in the future.
It's too much of a risk for me to drawn in your tusks. You've heard of the #Me Too movement?
Could you tilt your tusk a little to the left?
Just don't go extinct so people can watch my brilliance
Well I can't draw you like "one of my French girls" if I don't even know what that is.
The tusks are perfectly proportional and, NO, I will not make them look bigger.
I promise! It doesn't make you look fat!
Crude? Well for your information, Werner Herzog said he loves my work.
Here's your Paleo-selfie.
Ok. I’m nearly done. Get the barbecue out... quietly...
Now smile, just a little.
Step one of the witness protection program is deciding on your new look.
It needs more tusk, I don’t look fierce enough yet.
Of course I support your decision to identify as cave-elephant.
Well I think you’re left side is better!
Thanks for creating fire. Now could you please hold still? Your tusks are jiggling.
Yes, your nose is longer than mine! So what?
Good, now imagine you're extinct.
Thanks, but could you please smile a bit less toothily?
That is my DNA .Can you do PCR of that
Sorry ... I won’t get into sculpting until the Plasticine Era.
A little more to the right.
Hold still, I'm getting the angle of your tusks just right.
Person, one word.
Hortense, though my art cannot do justice to your beauty please accept this simple portrait as a token of my devotion.
As Grog is my witness...I swear it's my mother's recipe wall.
I’m trying to keep it non-political.
No I'm not going to make you look thinner!
Do you think I made the nose too big?
Would you please turn more toward the light.
My bike got stolen recently
We can finish up tomorrow so don't forget, use the front cave entrance.
I only carve in grayscale.
You just stepped on my model.
No, I won't draw your tusks - someone may steal them!
Oh, be quiet. I have to start somewhere.
If you want to avoid extinction, you need one of these.
I swear to God if you don't stay still I will hunt you to extinction
Wish they had this apparatus so the subject couldn’t see their portrait till I’m done
Let's try a profile pose this time around. You're all nose in the portrait.
Because I'm going to be famous in 30,000 years, that's why.
No no no no...this is not a death portrait.
Full-faced or profile; with that face it doesn't really matter.
You'll trumpet and smile or I'll turn this into a woolly mammoth.
I want you to draw me like one of your french mammoths.
No charge.
I'll bring out the brown of your eyes when you come up with the rest of the deposit.
This would be so much easier if you gave me a few minutes to invent the mirror!
Will you stop moving around.
OK, relax. I'm taking 30 for a BrontoBurger. Can you remember your place?
I think it’s the fire, making it warm up everywhere.
Is this your best side?
I know it's small, but I don't have enough charcoal to make you life-size.
Yes, I know the left is your best side.
What's a republican?
No, I can't make you look like George Clooney.
You were right charcoal does work, but I don't see it becoming popular with artists.
Keep still Mr. Mammoth, 5 more millennia and you will be frozen in time.
Hold still while I capture you in this light.
No, I don't wish you were a Corgi...
Can you a little to the right?
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
But then, after writing is invented, people won’t need primitive drawings any more.
Lower your head and give me fierce - I can edit out the double chin.
Don’t mention the hieroglyph in the room.
c'mon, look alive.
Well, the menu is ready! Now it's time to prepare dinner ... but I think I'm going to need a fire a little bit bigger.
Lift your tusks--just slightly.
„Stand still! I need to capture your wrinkles.“
Frodo why do you always forget? I only paint from memory! Go play.
Don't YOU remember the lesson on artistic license?
A bit more to the left.
Did I get your good side?
How many times do aid have to tell you to keep your head still
Forget the mammoth hype ... you're a Republican.
.... now, say 'C H E E S E'!
Name's Donald Trunk. Make me look good and I'll leave you a big deposit.
Hold still! From the looks of those volcanos we don't have much time.
Ceci n'est pas un mammouth laineux.
Alright Mona Lisa, now give me that little half smile.
It would have been helpful if you brought your baby pictures.
Some guy named, Darwin, says you once looked like this runt.
If we were that easy to capture, we'd be extinct.
If you move one more time, I'm gonna bring in T-Rex to pose.
Yes I do know about ‘@woolymammoth.too’... and no, painting you nude DOES NOT mean I want to sleep with you!
It's not Bimbo-It's Dumbo-OK?
For now, move just a little to the left. We'll eat you later.
Just pretend you're happy to see me.
Can you sneeze a bit slower ?
This is for posterity! Can't you look a bit more animated?!
If you hadn't shaved all your fur off I could have gotten a better likeness.
Don’t worry, the wall takes off 10 pounds.
Draw me like one of your french mammoths.
What do you mean it's an unflattering portrait?
Welcome to anatomy 101.
What do you mean 'I don't have a Trump trunk'?
I need you to stand still, dammit.
I need you to gently pull down these bricks to use in our Great Wall!
Try to see it from my perspective.
While preparing my Meat Loaf, I now concur with my fellow cavemen that animals drawn on the cave wall are indeed closer than they appear.
Believe me - sexual arousal is not my intent.
Please do not attempt to return; security has your picture.
So you could better??
Trust me, they'll love it come the Renaissance.
By the time I'm done with what I have to say, your ancestors will have stories they will never forget.
Alright. How would YOU greatly exaggerate the rumors of your demise?
A little to the left please!
If you keep on moving, I'm not going to get to work on time
No, I'm not going to do your tusks. This is supposed to be a nudie.
What do you mean, someday you'll be doing your own selfies?
Tell me about those eight men. What'd they see?
Smile! It's for the Barnum and Bailey poster.
How come I am the one drawn naked while you keep the wool?
No, I won't make you look slender.
I’m bringing a minimalist perspective to that old saying, ‘There’s a mammoth in the cave’.
This is my truth.
A Wooly Mammoth... These things will never go extinct
You need to be still Mona Lisa...
Seven feet long, 400 pounds, I know, I know.
Of course they'll forget you! That's why we do THIS!
Great! My trunk is up and facing the opening of the cave.
I needed some light in here, stand still
Your dick is, like, CRAZY big.
Turn more to your right!
Do you like your right side better?
You try painting her from memory.
Go ahead, make love to the cavern!
Just stop it, you don't look fat!
Sorry, no family portraits.
I said “Freeze!”
You are such a show off, but I am not drawing your third tusk on my cave.
This is an ab-original.
Hold your tusks. I'm a minimalist!
So it’s not as good as my “horses.” You’re a more substantial subject — show a little empathy!
You're going for that Mona Lisa pose again, aren't you?
What do you mean 'Fake News'?
No tusks! This is artistic license.
Yep. There's room right here below your baby portrait
Can you be still when I draw your tusks?
No one’s gonna believe this if I don’t get a picture!
Sorry Steve, this is naturalism. You're gonna have to remove the Invisalign.
You shall be remembered
I'm going for a more Platonic ideal elephant than mere verisimilitude.
I said don’t blink!
I'm posting this on Facebook Wooly, size doesn't matter!
If you want to get to the Field Museum, you will have to go jump into the tar pit.
Say "cheeeese".
I really don't want to talk about it.
Swipe right or left?
How could you forget the earring?!...Never mind, don’t answer that....
The more you move the less photorealistic this is going to be.
Listen, I’m not here to massage your ego, you paid me for a realistic portrait, and that is what you’ve got. Pay up.
.....and now I want one with you putting your foot in the fire.
Nude mammoths are avant-garde.
You will remember this moment for a long time...
Your profile looks just like your Mom's.
I think I've really captured the color of your eyes this time.
Don’t drop your trunk.
My art is fine. It's your tusk that's uneven.
With, or without the atlatl?
No, I won't drape you. I only draw nudes.
What? Don't you like Mick Stevens's drawing of you?
Okay, on the count of three say mammoth.
Come on, work for me baby.
Yeah, yeah. I promise I won't draw you fat.
I would call your style primitive but it would be rhetorical
It worked, Mr. Thompson. You're completely gluten free.
Now turn sideways.
Yes, your left profile is a little more flattering.
"Please move a little more to your right for better fire lighting".
Don't worry! You won't forget this one.
I am capturing your playful smile! Quit complaining!
Turn around. I think your other end would look better.
I think this is a good start.
You have to hold that trunk still, or I'll never get the shading right!
You try painting with a pair of tusks.
. Look for another line of work. Portraits aren't your strong suit.
I told you before; No, I can't airbrush out your wrinkles!
The cave takes off five pounds.
Well, you're not the greatest model.
Draw me like one of your Paleolithic girls.
Yes, it’s okay if you smoke. Just try not to move your head.
See, you do have something in your tooth.
What do you mean 'it's not your good side'?
You have to hold really still or you’ll be mistaken for a mastodon.
I told you, no smiling!
The agency said you'd get a meal after we're done.
"I'm putting-up reward to anyone who finds baby 'Pickles'"!
Quit sneezing!
Do I have your best side?
Not to worry. No one will be able to tell that I Photocaved you.
I feel it’s your attempt to legislate evolution. How’s about I paint you without a beard?
Try not looking down your nose at my painting!
No, you can’t wait around to be done by da Vinci.
What do you mean you don’t like it? Can you draw...no! I’m an artist! No stick figures from me! Geez!
Okay, someone has to address the mastodon in the cave: I can't draw.
oh, forget it!
Voila! The mastodon brand licenses another property to its portfolio.
You said 'conventional glyph', right?
"It's not your best side"...So I FORGOT!?!
Not sure if this is uncouth but can you make my tusks whiter?
Now try to look less massive.
I know you always crack up when I add the spears.
Oh, look, another profile.
Oh, for cryin' out loud! No, I did NOT make you look fat.
Etch me like one of your French girls.
I’m trying to show off your good hide.
Come on, raise your trunk and smile.
you can't leave. you're trunk
What's a PowerPoint?
You are not! The cave wall always adds ten pounds.
I'm hoping for commercial work.
Police sketch no been invented yet. Best I do is Ugg-shot.
Do you remember last weeks pose? Let's return.
That looks nothing like one of your French girls!
Does this scale?
Hold still, or we BOTH be extinct by time I finish masterpiece!
Of course it's not to scale, Eli. It's an artist's rendering for pity sake, so stop your whining and stand still.
Will you please stand still!
That's not my best side.
smile and don't blink
Smile, Mona
Perfect! Now hold that never-forgetful look form me, willya.
well, then put some clothes on.
That's it. Give me your Mona Lisa smile.
You're blocking my sunlight
You wouldn't understand, it's called Food Porn.
At least they can't say the elephant in the room went unnoticed
MY ancestors did the originals!!! We got peanuts for it!
NOW you tell me it's not your best side?
Some day you’ll be known as the elephant in the cave . . .
Stop giggling. You try painting during the earthquake.
Would you please stand still and smile? I have another commission in the next cave I have to get to.
Damn it, you blinked!
You are my true muse and I am Renoir, reborn. I love my models "plump and peachy".
I'm going ahead, image rights or no!
Paint me like one of your French girls — wooly.
Could you turn your head slightly to the left?
Just hold still. We won't have to do this for another 2 years.
Hold still Dumbo!
You know, showing stretch marks is the new thing.
I did not draw your nose too large.
It is you when you hold your trunk up.
You may not like it, but minituarization is the wave of the future!
"This is my last try, Spike. If this painting doesn't sell, you will be losing some ivory.
I'm not finished. Don't you dare go extinct.
Stop whining, I'm a minimalist!
Hey, you were just telling me you didn't want people judging you by tusk size.
No! I won't make your trunk look bigger.
I know the lighting is bad, but we can't retake it!
Can we make the nose a bit t
Any trunk pointing is considered discrimination in our pachyderm herd.
Hold still for a minute.
If you want to be on Instagram you're gonna have to wait a few eons.
I said paint me like one of your French girls.
What do you mean I'm not showing your best side?
Hold still will you!
Is this jogging your memory?
Did you want it from the right side instead?
Do you still have an inferiority complex because you have little tusks?
Yeah, right, and your trunk's longer too.
Here is your cousin, the Corgi Mastodon. Good for herding cattle.
I didn't get it for fire or the wheel, but maybe mammoth drawings will get me a Nobel.
..and we'll put in some happy little trees to make our friend feel at home.
Could you stop with the duck face already?
C'mon Fred, we have had this pictionary category before..Legendary memory, my arse!
That's not even my good side.
Just hold still a little longer, I am almost done!
I want to submit this picture to the 'Hieroglyphics Herald', favorite pet edition.
Listen up...Someday you'll have to fight a creature more powerful than this...It's called a donkey.
I'm going to need more than peanuts if you want me to remove my trunk.
'You have terrible peanut breath'!
Do these tusks make me look fat.
'I've always been a huge fan.'
No, I don’t it makes you look hippy at all!
Yes...this is exactly the same room in which I did the donkey.
How do you feel about working for peanuts?
"For the last time, I told you it's called abstract".
It's called Fake News.
No, not cave art. Lunch specials.
My new technique gives animal forms a more life-like appearance than in older cave paintings.
I Man... You Elephant... You My Symbol... We Make Cave Great Again.
This will go a lot faster if you stop resting and levitate again.
Paint me like one of you Indian elephants.
This is just a preliminary sketch. We can always photoshop the tusks in later.
Look over your tusks mischievously. It's not political.
I don't remember looking like that.
I don't care what Madden BC pays, I'm not compensating you for the use of your image.
First Instagram....“move to your right so I get the fire”.
Hey - who's the artist here???
I don't care if your nose is getting hot, hold still!
What's wrong? I'm getting your good side!
Don't look at me like that.
Wanna be the first vitruvian elephant?
Oh I like that! Now give me sexy!
I think you’re trying to show me that size does matter.
Can you turn your trunk a little to the left? The light's better.
Okay, okay. I'll make the tusks bigger already.
Every Mastodon's a critic.
Alright already. So you have evolved. I can't help it if my drawing is rather primitive.
I know your memory's infallible, but we humans depend on visual prompts.
Because this end is more interesting to draw, that's why.
I don't do nudes.
Is that with one “m”, or two?
It's your inner elephant!
You may have invented fire but I get to record history.
Hey, I'm paying scale for a model, not an art critic."
oh fuck
Trust me, this is better. Tusks are hard, OK? I can never get the perspective right.
Everyone's a critic now.
On the contrary, I'm not making you look ancient.
I'm just guessing about how to draw your back half.
I'm calling it Grand Old Pachyderm.
A peanut break - again? And you call yourself a Mastadon?
...just a little to the right so the light reflects just a bit more off your tusks.
One of these days I'll be discovered.
Hold still or I'll get the tusks wrong!
Maybe if you got more wood for the fire id get your cheeckbones right.
Hunting was just not in me man
For a mastodon, this is New York skinny.
Look you could even dance if you want. It will be the Greatest Show on Earth
trust me you, people will pay to see you
Now show me some gravitas.
This is you, outside and happy.
I had not realized you were so horny.
I've never seen them, but I have all their albums.
You can’t even remember to keep still.
"you missed a spot" mammoth
I know it's too small, but I have wooly mammoths, dinosaurs, and giant sloths that have reserved space!
I know...charcoal adds 10 lbs...
Just let me finish the horns and then you can go out and relieve yourself.
I paint what I see.
Does this make you look fat?
Believe me, in a million years, no one will care you had tusks.
No, no, no draw me like one of your French girls
If you don't stop fidgeting, no one will have a good picture of what you looked like.
This way, I won't forget you either.
Is that really me? I had no idea I was that heavy?
Wait, your right side is your better side?
Would you please stand still! You want me to be done by winter, right?
Relax! Any wrinkles, cellulite...we'll Photoshop it right out.
This is going to look great on my Insta-Rock.
Tusks are extra.
You just don't understand modern art!
Mmm...w-o-o-l....Is that one l or two?
Hold still. I have three other specials to draw.
I said an elephant never forgets!
Mona, is your last name really Lisa?
Tsk, tusk, you can't carve up my cave wall
Listen, we pachyderms are highly intelligent and I'm telling you the perspective is way off!
No I can't paint you a little tinner!
Dude, just get a mirror already.
Your specie is at a disadvantage when they stick peas up their nose.
“And your your image will represent hunters, gun owners, and deniers of science, evolution, global warming..... but at least you’ll be extinct” global warming....
It’s good, but I think you made my nose too big.
Don't be so judgy, it's the first drawing ever.
You are the perfect symbol for the Grand Old Pliocene era.
The irony is the elephant is in the room.
No, I won't add an emoji.
In the studio: beyond postmodernism
Don’t worry about your trunk size, it’s irrelephant
It's meant to be an impression.
Pay Attention! This is for your own good!
Is that with one tusk or two?
Fat shaming? I prefer to think of it as downsizing.
Warning: things in the rear are larger than they appear.
Our future inhabitants will hardly gaze upon your picture, they will always be enthralled by just how we got you in here.
Don't you want to trim up your horns before I finish this very permanent portrait?
...and quit blinking your eyes.
How do you expect me to get it right if you don't stand still?
I know it's not a good likeness, but I got to make you look prehistoric. Folks'll be tromping down here. They'll pay top dollar to get a peek at prehistoricism.
Me first artiste. You first subject matter.
Sorry, I don’t do trunks or tusks!
Keep still, I've got to get this right for future EPA'ers as some day you'll be extinct!
I'm sorry but the granite add 15 pounds.
I'm trying for a kinder, gentler look.
Earliest forms of social media were also used to show others your meal.
Wait til the temperature drops! Then, you really won't be able to move!
It’s a Rorschach blot test and you seeing yourself is very strange.
You've given a pretty bare description for someone with a supposedly great memory.
OK, but just one more and then bed.
Imagination isn't enough. We need procreation.
For the last time, I'm not trying to make you look fat!
"Tsk, tsk"? Is that all you can say?
Does it look like I own a Polaroid ?
With or without fur?
The rest of the class wanted you covered.
It's called abstract.
One more goose-jab and I'm outta here!
If you had stuck to your herbal detox, you would have looked a lot slimmer.
But that IS your good side.
See, I have had you since you were this little, and now all this talk about leaving and finding your tribe.
I wanted to catch the feminine side of you. what do you think?
Please don't make me look too tusky.
Your due date is about a year.
Would you please hold still?
I always thought it was easy for you to floss.
No, goddammit, you can’t have bamboo.
I'd like to see YOU try to mix these dyes and paint on this crooked surface, I need dedicated studio space!!
if you keep your trunk straight it makes you look thinner
After this one we'll take a walk through the proofs
Trust me, you won't look like Jimmy Durante.
Draw me like one of your Gaulish girls.
No enhancements. I paint proboscises as I see 'em.
Your eyes are going to be the tricky part..
This is so _I'll_ never forget _you_.
I know it doesn't look like you, I'm not finished yet.
Keep your day job.
Considering the history your own mammoth forebearers, I’d be a little more careful of who you call derivative.
Paint me like one of your cave girls
It's called Fake News.
Will this be done before your wife gets home?
"Be careful, That creature from two weeks ago's cartoon caption is lurking around here !'
Why am I burning a fire in the middle of the day?
Are you here for the painting or for the fire?
"You realize you are working for peanuts"....
You won't smile until I draw the hunters you like to stomp on and chase. . . Is that it?
After you I am going to do nudes.
That's not my good side.
It’s not just another potboiler! I’m trying to capture your uniqueness.
Hold your trunk up a little higher.
I think I’ll call it: ‘The Elephant in the Cave.’ It’ll become a phrase for the ages.
Trust me, your portrait will be one steppe ahead of the rest.
But, you told me to paint you like one of my Cenozoic girls...
Stop fidgeting or I'll never get your trunk right.
This is going to go down in history
Stand still,you won’t be paid until it’s sold
Hold still! They won't vote until you get there!
Don't get excited if it looks short, David. The religious council dictates the proportions for male appendages.
You didn't shave. I told you to shave.
Next time just take a damn selfie.
You're not making me big enough. Also, you need to curve my trunk down, and give me two tusks curved upward. And don't forget the hair!
Well we’ll just see who thinks it’s just a stupid drawing after you go extinct.
Do you want the whole family in this?
Tusk tusk! Don’t fall asleep on me yet.
Keep your trunk straight please.
No I cannot start over and make you look less fat.
Ew, no, I look so fat. Delete it.
Enough with the chiaroscuro talk! Your tusks are featured, okay?
Remind me again why I am doing this
You'll be immortal!
You moved your trunk!
What! You forgot what you looked like when you were a calf?
I know, I know, but she's got a great personality!
Head up! Hold it, hold it! Now show me some tusk, baby!
I'll put the donkey on the left.
"You can mope all you want, I told you I'm not drawing your trunk to size.
Don't forget. I just draw 'em as I see 'em, Mr. Gray,
No Tusks, PLEASE, no tusks
Ugga-ugga ...Stay still. You’ll be famous in 200,000 years. Believe me. 200,000 years!
Hold still or I won't get the shading right
Don't worry. You'll forget all about this.
I get this one, you did the last one.
Does this brush make your butt look fat?
Dammit! Keep the trunk UP!
Hold that pose, the firelight on your trunk is just right!
No, I don't think tusks are sexy.
I haven't mastered drawing tusks.
Believe me, we are going nowhere unless we participate in the arts.
It's Still Life With Tusks.
If you hadn't slept through health class you would know this was the female of your species.
"It WILL be a selfie".
A memory for posterity?
Because, unfortunately by the time you leave the poachers will have them
Of course you're inside. Outsider art doesn't rear its head for centuries.
I need to get this right. No one will ever believe you existed.
I'm a modernist. Modernists paint modern pachyderms.
Well, if I do this right, you will go down in history as the mascot of a political party called "gop"
For future generations’ sake - don’t move before I have finished this sketch
I told you. I will not give you fake yellow hair and a comb over.
No, I will not make you look thinner!
you need to hold your stampede pose...
Uh .... but your nose IS that long
What do you mean, the nose is all wrong?
Either you like Picasso, or you don't like Picasso.
Okay Dumbo, don't move while I get your right side.
OK, one more time. You come from the right, sack the quarterback and we’re golden!
What's the matter? You have to go pee?
No, it’s not a dog. It’s creative license!
It makes you look about sixty years younger.
You're supposed to be a SUPPORT mammoth!
I'm calling my new invention the Facebook wall.
I need my wheel invention to become a thing, so I can quit this damn cave drawing job.
I know the aspect-ration is off!
I'm sorry, but it really doesn't look anything like me.
Please stand still.
Cavemansplaining
O.K., Griswold, this is a mastodon, like you. Before mating season begins next week you'll need to know the difference between mastodons and mammoths. Oh, and one other thing to know...
Donkeys won’t evolve for another five million years, so we’re in the only echo chamber in town.
The color of this cave matches your pigment nicely.
Hold still! How do you expect me to capture the texture of your tusks when you're moving
Try to look ferocious.
Have you quite done yet?
Could you turn your head a little to the right? It'll bring out the battle scar on your tusk.
Sorry but I’m a little dyslexic.
Don't worry, the bloody stick adds ten thousand pounds.
Mitch, please stop moving around!
I told you this would be easier than painting that damn hummingbird!
Gimme a break! I'm only on "Learn How to Draw" lesson 2.0 !
I left off the tusks because they block your eyes.
I got the body from the side, but, by the time I get to the head, he's turned three quarters round.
The color is called "wall grey;" it approximates your skin tone.
You know you're going to have to pay for this portrait with your tusks, right? You want me to draw them anyway?
Are you sure? I think they kind of make your ears and feet look small.
Your voice stinks, so we're going to stick to silent pictures.
Trust me on this, the Mona Lisa's gonna be small, too.
That's not my good side.
Work with me, sweetheart.
I wanted to be a shoe salesman, but mother said it wasn’t practical.
A little more to the RIGHT, please.
How's this for your Tinder pose?
Alright, I promise I won't paint red and white stripes and a white star over blue, on it.
If you can't hold still, I'll have to use the saber-toothed tiger on the cover page.
For fun, let's have you fighting a tyrannosaurus!
This lighting is terrible! What more do you expect from me, working in these conditions?
I'm not drawing you. I just need you to fan the flames.
I know it's dinner time, but can't you wait for another 5 minutes.
tusks up, trunk down.
What do you mean it looks like a critter?
We need to try a different pose.
Won't it be nice for your grandkids' grandkids to look back on this centuries from now?
This will identify you in the new cave vetting system.
Quite a small fire for such a large barbacue !
Ok, no more calculus. Take out your crayons.
Now if you're starting to feel relaxed enough, you're welcome to take a bit of that wool off.
Any other identifying features?
Perceive with your eyes, not your mind.
I need to paint it again, you blinked.
What do you expect if you refuse to hold still
NOW LOOK, DUMBO. YOU'VE FLUNKED THIS FORTY TIMES. HARVARD???
I know it's Babar-ish, but it's you.
How many wallet-size would you like?
It's not supposed to speak to you.
Yes, all the proportions are correct, and no, I won't chisel them any larger.
Stop that shifting ...
Be patient — I'm updating your cave-networking profile.
I don’t care if you think it's too “bold, earthy, and naturalistic." Just tell me if you've seen this Mastodon.
I'm grateful to be living in such 'hygge' times.
I guess this Paleolithic diet isn’t doing anything for me!
O K! But WHAT! is a REPUBLICAN?
Did I get the nose right?
Why can’t you keep it up? Junk in the trunk?
It's a rent-controlled cave.
Seriously, no bathrooms? But your ads say this is an upscale restaurant.
Stay still, will you?
I got sick of the dire rat race.
pay me in peanuts, this is the best you gonna get.
You may think this is mansplaining, but bear with me.
Sorry, we only have one filter for selfies: campfire smoke.
Okay, okay! I’ll acknowledge the behemoth elephant in the room.
hold that pose
Turn to your left and be still. There is a waiting line outside for warm cave time!
This is your good side.
Let's try striking a different pose for our next petroglyph, shall we? Your neck will look a lot longer if your drop your shoulders.
Drawing you without the tusks since they will never be worth anything.
Smile like you mean it!
No, he doesn't look just like George Clooney.
We'll if you would stop moving!
Longer trunk, move it to the left - just make up your mind!
Look, I never claimed I was Rembrandt
If you don’t remain still I won’t be able to capture your delicious cheekbones in all their splendor.
I'm considering adding hair. It would make you appear more stately.
This thing in my hand? I call it a selfie stick.
Draw me like one of your Neanderthal girls
I'm not "trying to make them look small", you just have small ears. One more word and history will forget you!
I know. I'm not there yet.
Is this one more to your liking?
Why? Performance anxiety.
I've been standing here for an hour and you still can't draw my nose properly.
My critics are gonna love this.
I'm leaving out the horns - they make you look fat.
Two hand spans to the left, and up a smidge, Og.
Yes, i'll lose the wart
Well, if you'd stop moving maybe I could do a better job!
IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS RIGHT AND GET IT FINISHED, PLEASE HOLD YOUR TRUNK UP!
Carve me like one of your French girls
The very first ‘Menu of the Day.’
This is 'Pachylicious', our most popular 'Tusk-Reduction' model....
Hmm...the trunk to tusk ratio can use a little work.
Your critique of my artistic style is not going to go well over the years
You still got my nose wrong!
OK... now give me some attitude.
So, swipe left or right?
Could you move your head slightly to the right
Your policy should include coverage for extractions.
How about a shot from the rear? I can't quite catch the smile.
The smile - if that's what it is - needs to be a little bit more enigmatic . . .
You really think you can do better?
Can you hang around a few more minutes till I get someone down here to witness this, otherwise they'll think it's photoshopped
Donald, if you change your position one more time...You're Fired!
the tusks are a portal to the soul
I'm devising a Competency Test
I know it’s not the same, but you’re not as beautiful as your sister
Just hold still another minute, I think I'm going to get a lot of "likes" on this one.
Try to look a little more mysterious.
Pointillism! Pointillism! Always you want the Pointillism. I 'm just NOT there yet!
Hold that smile - I will make you immortal!
SEXY is what I want you to project!
If you don't sit still, no one will ever believe you existed.
After 4 years of art school, I know which is your better side.
Just hang in there until the Dinosaurs get here.
Trunk up, please.
I told you I'm in Cave Drawing: Part 1 !
Now hold that pose. The eyes are the most important part.
But, we really are related. Here’s you and...
Is my nose really that big?
Prehistoric Dating Services "I said I'm straight, not that my trunk is straight. Please revise my ad, and help me find a curvy female."
I already told you. It's my Caption Contest entry.
OK...You're the Ur-emoji--now when do I get those tusks?
Now you think of a caption along with thousands of other elephants and at the end of the week I will carve the best caption into the wall.
Your trunk is drooping again.
No!!! You're in great shape! Of course the Mastedons are gonna smash those Dinohippuses in the fall!
What do you mean 'put it on a milk carton?'
And they said I should stick to handprints.
What do you mean’ ‘you don’t remember signing up for this’?
Wil you stand still?
Family. Do not eat. Think you can remember that?
You look great in this lighting.
No, this angle does not make you look fat.
Draw me like one of your French girls, Jack.
Carve me like one of your French girls
You're disgusting. It's obviously a tail.
You’re sure this is the one?
Why hold still? So I can immortalize your species if it goes extinct.
The more you move, the longer this is going to take
It's the first painting since I discovered track lighting.
I know this is public cave property but I am making a political statement here.
I’m afraid those molars will need to come out.
So, my wife had the kid, took off to her mother's cave and that's the last I've seen of her!
I’m just confirming my reservation for tomorrow.
You're too thin-skinned!
Your body is a tool, not a work of art in itself.
Put the trunk back up and stay in pose or I am not paying you.
Say "cheeeese".
Hey , stand still or I'll make it look like a duck with stubby legs!
Barney, stop that. No mugging.
Perfect. Now stay frozen just like that for the next million years.
For the last time, I don't know what a "French girl" is.
You'll have to wait a million years for a frontal view
Hold hat pose. No, a little to the right.
Hold still. And don't turn around.
I don't care if it does make you look fat, I'm not going to 'shave off' ten pounds.
I don't want the tusks. I just want you to stand still. Get it?
Tilt you trunk a little to the left.
No. No. I'm almost done. You're just gonna have to hold it.
The light is perfect. Don't sneeze!
Of course you're sexier; this isn't impressionism.
I'm sure you don't have any trouble remembering what I look like. Just hold your trunk back up or I'll never be able to finish.
Just think about it... you will always represent Neanderthals
You DON'T look fat.
Hold still a little longer. I don't quite have your tusks.
I asked the agency for a mammoth and they sent me a runt like you.
Never mind the elephant in the room, I think something's burning.
Pre-historic police sketch artist
You don't think there's a mammoth likeness?
It's a heffalump. I am beyond primitive realism.
Well I do forget so be still.
When I say hut, you go long.
I'm done with trying to straighten you out!
I've got a pretty good memory as well Susan, and I distinctly remember you calling me a Neaderthal!
It was only a half hour after he put down his chisel that the entire cave filled with molten lava, forever erasing another work of art.
‘My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around’ is easier said than done.
I just discovered fire, give me a few million years before I get to realism.
Typical! Just as I've finished you say you'd prefer a tyrannosaurus.
Can you follow this?
Will you stop moving? It's really difficult for me if you keep moving
How can it be too traditional!?
For posterity, turn slightly to the left and tilt your head.
Traditional is fine here but pink elephants would look super in your baby's room.
I know you're mammoth in size but I'm still calling this a mastodon.
Trust me. You're gonna be mammoth. "Trust me. You're gonna be mammoth.
Stop staring! You'll be famous one day because of me!
Don't forget you aren't suppose to move.
you are a little too tense,relax
I call it "Mastodon sans Tusk"
How big do you want me to draw your tusks?
Its art. I don't care what you think.
How do you spell barbeque?
This is not an elephant
I know how GOP is not how you spell elephant.
Yes, this will scale for Tinder.
It's gestural, I'm not a camera.
Just hold it for a few more minutes... this light pops your eyes and the angle is so slimming.
...And you're comfortable standing for a while?
Beats a saber-toothed tiger, I guess.
Don't worry, Photoshop will take off at least 200 pounds.
I wouldn't have to restart if your sneezing would stop!
Turn your head a bit, would you?
That's not my flattering side; try again.
Can you show me a little more skin?
Pose again next Tuesday? Leftover sabretooth snacks.
Hey, uhh, I know it's abstract and all but why are those guys pointing their spears at me?
Can you move your tusk a little to the left?
Tell me more about this “ wheel” cause I’m out of ideas.
I said hold the pose, godammit! I bet they didn’t have these problems at Lascaux!
I did not forget the tusks. I just haven't drawn them yet.
Hold still while I invent chiaroscuro.
You'll be competing against an ass; go figure...
This is my first paleo-conservative yard sign.
I agree; your left profile is much nicer.
It may take awhile but someday I'm going to be famous!
No, I don’t have a mirror.
One invention leads to another. First I invented fire and then charcoal. Next I'm going to invent black-face comedy acts.
“In ten thousand years people will be gasping at the beauty and authenticity of my artwork..... In the meantime, I call it my post-Neanderthal period.
Would you quit moving!? I will paint the fire instead!
You should've seen the ass that was here before you...
Could you turn just a bit to the left, please?
Just one more standing and we'll be done -bellissimo!
Really? Well if you think this is so easy, why don't you draw your own #%@$& portrait?
Sorry but the firelight adds a few pounds
Hold still Mona, I am trying to capture your smile.
You blinked.
If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times, you do not look fat.
Paint me like one of your Lascaux mammoths
You mastodon, me artodon, so quit fidgeting and hold still.
Thank you, I won't forget this.
Yes it’s small, it’s a miniature portrait.
Trust me, I know a white elephant when I see one.
I'm drawing a less mammoth version of you.
Now they can't ignore you.
Of course my color choices are not accurate--you know nothing of Fauvism.
Well, I am painting from memory since you stepped on my eyeglasses.
Don’t move, and you will be immortal!
Working multiple jobs that pay peanuts caught up with him.
Dammit, stay still! It's bad enough in this light!
Look! I can only make the tusks long!
"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes".
Stand still, will ya!?
Now if you could move a little to the right
Eventually, your children, a calf will become the African Elephant with a life span of 70 years.
I didn't say you could look yet -- get back in profile.
How can you look fat when this is a two dimensional painting?
No dude I have no idea why they are obsessed with cave cartons
The Allegory of the Cavemansplainer
Wow! You really captured the enormity of the matter!
Da trunk bone connected to da tusk bone, da tusk bone connected to da neck bone...
Don't forget - you knew me before MOMA.
This would be AMAZING if I had some natural light.
Hate to disappoint -but this exactly what I’m seeing...
Don't worry. They'll figure out I'm not a literalist.
You're headed for extinction and my ancestors will invent plastic.
You see? I did this for Jumbo and he's got more work than he can handle.
People will be fascinated, they have never seen anything like this.
Oh, no worries, we’ll just Photoshop those curves in
"Open your legs a bit".
I'm a Republican, so you can't have any tusks!
YOUR ELEPHANT COUSIN WILL PROBABLY SURVIVE. BUT IF YOU DON'T WORK HARDER ON YOUR BROWSING AND GRAZING SKILLS, YOU AND I ARE BOTH GONNA BE EXTINCT.
No, it's not what I am cooking for dinner.
WORK IT!
You still don't get the joke? Let me draw you a picture. I saw an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in them I'll never know.
Please extend your trunk, just a few minutes, I've almost got it
No! Your nose isn’t THAT big.
Do you want me to retouch your portrait?
I don't see the resemblance
The great painter Uga Chacka Picasso paints one of the defining pictures of the cave-expressionism movement.
Everybody's an art critic.
Sure, we'll both be famous, soon as we go extinct
You're all over the map today. I can't decide which mastodon to paint.
Trust me, there is a likeness.
Those are nice tusks, now show me some trunk
If I'm stuck in these fucking prehistoric cartoons, you are too, so hold still!
You'll thank me when you're famous!
And 'M' is for Mastodon.
If you don't want to look like something extinct, you'll have to be still.
Snelfie's take time!
Don't worry, this is just a sketch. In the final portrait, you will be massive and your horns will be HUGE.
I am almost finished with the drawing; you have been very good model!
...when I asked for a cave portrait you told me you only drew landscapes.
I know you trying to document me but, it just isn’t coming out right. But, I guess you’rr trying so I’ll give you that.
Happy with the result for a first sitting?
Updating status on Cavewall. #LoveMyMammoth
I'm leaving out the tusks. In a few thousand years, they'll look very dated.
I assure you, your portrait will be famous for centuries!
And what shall we name thee? “Big Bony Ones” or “Droopy?”
Don't grunt. I did this with you behind me!
Ok, now just like the bulls, I'm going to draw your picture here and you and I will be really famous one day, ok!?
What do you mean? It looks exactly like you!
Please, just one little smile
Almost through. Just hold still and keep smiling.
Great memory or not, the sketch still looks like every other elephant
I'm not gonna talk to you; get out of here! You are a fake elephant!
You stuff them - THEN you paint them.
Oh, stop pouting and put aside your pachyderm pride. I'm the painter and I want a profile, not a portrait!
My ears are not that small!
Turn that Lasqaux-l into a La-smile

It's not supposed to be you, I'm an impressionist
after I am done with your portrait, can I have you for supper?
Pout, baby, pout
Try to look more enigmatic.
You are there, I am here
Just don’t forget the #photocredit this time!
Now, give me 'sexy'.
Cut me some slack, I'm new to the chisel movement.
Say fromage.
Turn a little to the right..
Looks like Ray Ramano.
You wanted your portrait to make you look more youthful. If I overdo it, you'll appear downright primordial.
Work it, Baby, work it!
Oh, that made me think, would you mind if I hung some wet clothes on your tusks?
Okay. Now what?
If you don't stand still, I won't be able to finish this.
Because selfies haven't been invented yet, that's why.
Cave-wall artistry is always more challenging when poor lighting is not the only elephant in the room.
Would you mind wearing a swimsuit?
That's all for today, we are losing the light.
Hold still. I have to get this before you become extinct.
No I said draw me like one of your French girls, Jack!
HOLD THAT POSE, OR YOU"RE MAMMOTHBUGER !
Can you hold that pose for just another 10 to 50 thousand years?
Will you stand still for a minute!
Agree now, but in 10,000 years this will be very funny
Now, this will be a 525,600,000 minute pose.
Be thankful, you have never been sexually harassed.
I should have just used the canvas.
When the menu was invented... "Tonight's specials are"
You're going to use this for your Facebook profile picture?
True artists don't pander to the vanity of every Tom, Dick, and Hairy.
I understand, but it will be mil I know, but it will be millennia before anyone masters perspective.
I'm sorry; painting nudes always distracts me
Allright I'll add a scale of 1:50, ok?
I want you to draw me like one of your Egyptians.
They say arts funding has dried up, but I had no trouble getting a federal grant.
Okay, now you're whimsical; now you're a little naughty.
Just a little caveshopping to accentuate your trunk
You're making me look like a mammoth" "Tusk-tusk, everyone's a critic
Are you sure he wasn't taller than this?
Take a hint.
The first fresco in Tusk-any
Tusks are behind the paywall.
TUSKS OR TUNK - That's the problem!  THE REST IS THE CHISEL
No, you don't look too crepey.
Felt the poetic license was kosher.
Be easy now . The stick puts on ten pounds.
Stop sucking in this may take a while
I am supposed to understand our relationship because you can draw a picture of me?
It took millions of years to get me here. I'm not starting over with your "good side".
Because if I were a Democratic strategist, I would be talking to whatever donkeys are gonna evolve from, alright!?
Turn your head a bit left, please.
Ok it's done!! Now i need come up with a name for an art movement...
The three kinds of flowers represent places in your past. It's a rock-cool portrait.
"Follows the herd" isn't the best caption for your profile pic.
You'd have better luck finding your kid if I drew a bunch of these on some Dimetrodons.
I don't know what a selfie is?
Our presidential portraiture style will capture your youth and slender figure for ages
Yeah, yeah -- you're very horny. You tried that same tired joke yesterday.
Well, don't just stand there...do something.
No peeking.
I'm tired. Why don't you just do a self-portrait from memory?
Don't "tusk tusk" me; I'm out of paint.
No....you won't look fat from this angle.
Could you hold your breath? You're putting out my light.
They say the wall adds ten pounds.
Would you mind staying still? This is the third time we’re trying! I’m not doing this for you, I’m doing this for posterity!
Don't tell me how to draw or I'll never put the tusks on!
What? You think you could do better?
No, I hadn't considered foreshortening.
I'd like more junk in her trunk.
Lose 3 lbs. Wait, make it 4.
Don't make me look too horny.
I call this naive perspective.
No, I won’t stick an actual spear in you rear. Now lift the trunk!
Hold still, I always mess this part up... dang ripplin sinew..
The volcanic light really highlights your facial features.
Someday you will regret this symbol....
I think I look better without all the ivory.
Could you get me the burnt sienna? I think I left it in the trunk.
Some are calling it, "Mod Rock." We're so past the realism of yesterday.
How do we feel about the orange?
Stop complaining. You could be doing this naked.
Again, how do you spell your name?
That's a rerun. I'm leaving to see what's on the next cave.
Make me a warm gray
I'd prefer an andy Warhol interpretation
My kids think painting anything but a selfie makes me a dinosaur.
Yeah, I know it’s small, but you can’t seem to grasp that I’m working on what I call a “ landscape.”
Don’t think you’re so special. I always hit on my models.
No, we are not writing cursive today!
Oh yeah? Well, I could crush your career!
Sorry buddy, you are a magnificent creature, but pigment supply is scarce.
Pay for two more centuries and I'll do tusks.
You're still big; it's the picture that got small!
Cut me some slack, will ya? I only have one good arm!
Sorry, airbrushing doesn't exist yet.
Try to look more dangerous.
Those troglodytes have no concept of realism.
Paint me like one of your Paleolithic girls.
Yes, I'll photo-shop the stretch marks. Keep still!
Trust me, no one wants a portrait with a big nose.
That's not my best side.
Try more for a "Come Hither" expression. Right now, the eyes are a bit dead.
Let’s face it, the Mona Lisa, you are not!
Dude, totally fine if you want to crash here, but why do you keep staring at my picture?
I got the idea from something I saw in Primitive Living magazine.
I keep telling you not to move your head!
Stop aping like a rhino and just be yourself.
Famous, famouse, or famice...which has the best ring to it?
Who do you think I am? Kehinde Wiley?
Steve Bannon's ancestor in the Cave of Altarighta
I am afraid that artistic integrity demands that I keep the wrinkles.
Hey! What's with the punim?
NO, I will NOT do another!
I know your feet hurt but if you don't stay still I can't capture their beauty!
I know the tusks are bigger, but you have to stand sideways.
Stop moving, I'm trying to practice for my art class.
Stop moving your trunk!
I don't sign my work and no, you cannot have a copy!

Do you have a reservation?

You think it's easy painting without numbers?
Before the free trial ends, please enter your billing information.
I asked for someone with big tits, not tusks
Now can you see how much better looking you're gonna be without them?!
I hope people will like this wall posting.
Don't forget, this is how selfies started out.
I'm just saying that the whole woolly look is passe. The trend is toward less bulky, fashion forward designs.
Ok to submit this portrait of your kid to the missing creatures list ?
I think we should keep those tusks a surprise.
She said you wouldn't mind. Ask her!
We could get this done a lot faster if we actually just used one of your tusks.
Stand still, dammit!
Okay that's real life now do Instagram.
Star Date 2266: "Dammit Jim, can't you remember that I'm a doctor, not a prehistoric police sketch artist!"
I need to get this done while there is still time. Your climate change denial won’t save you.
Don’t make me look fat.
Your kids will love having this some day!!
God damn it... Stand still.
Okay, now smize.
Sorry Bob, but the editors want you staring at an ass.
I hope body shaving is a passing fad for you Woolly Mammoths.
I'm sorry, but this is my minimalist phase.
It isn't supposed to look exactly like you. You want my grandson Picasso to give it another try?
If you had big hands I’d add the tusks.
Maybe draw my other side, it’s my best side.
In a thousand years people will wonder what it is.
Turn a little to the left.
Don't you want to be remembered for more then the size of your tusks?
I don't do 'bigly'!
No, I won't make your tusks larger. This is not a two dimensional avatar of unobtainable standards.
Look, those volcanoes outside are gonna blow in 10 minutes tops, and you're critiquing my brushwork? Get over yourself.
No tusks - you've been re-branded as a metro-mastodon.
I’m calling this a cartoon. If Wilma asks, I’m saying its name is Dino
Can you turn a little to the left, please?
Can you help me think of a funny caption for this?
I want the world to know about my love for you.
no, you may not take a bathroom break.
Something for scale, perhaps?
WAIT A MINUTE, AND CHEER UP I'M YOUR TUTOR
We now have much more time to focus on this painting, since Jognar left me for Grognak
Here's your selfie.
Stop complaining your tusks don't look Presidential enough! People don't appreciate me either!
Fleetwood Mac songs?
It would only be a mistake of mammoth proportions if I said I was done...
Look alive, Bertha!
-"That looks nothing like me Mike", -"Relax Lox! Its just a rough sketch".
oh no, I have to retake it. You closed your eyes again!
Go next door if you want your trunk to look smaller.
Hold still!
Stop complaining... at least you'll be famous after history begins.
Don't give me your 'fake news' face.
My tar pits are the critics.
Oh, come on! It’s my very, very first try!
This is you in another thousand years.
Keep still, dammit. This is for posterity.
Just turn towards the entrance so I can get your tusks right.
Would you like me to airbrush those wrinkles a bit?
Hold still. I can't seem to get your nose-thingy right.
I think we need to make you cuter. You know, like they did with Mickey Mouse?
The first iteration of Uber.
Any personal message?
this has to last for millenia, so hold those tusks still.
Make sure you get my eyes right.
What did you expect for a yearbook photo?
Okay, now smize.
Please focus! Or I’ll readjust your tusk to trunk ratio.
Please stop moving and hold still. I'm trying to work here.
Day 56: My drawing seems to have improved, but I still can't figure out why this giant hamster is growing bones out of its body. To draw or not to draw the bones?
I made a nice picture of you- now tickle me with those ivories.
No need to feel shy. Nothing in the world is more beautiful or significant of the laws of the universe than the naked female body.
Please don't forget who drew this.
...if he is coming from the right, give him priority.
What do you mean I'm not addressing the elephant in the room?
Someday you will belong 2 the Russians.
OK, listen up Twinkletoes. . . you can do this ballet pirouette if you lose 5 pounds; never underestimate the power of positive thinking!
Yes,yes, I know. Your eyes are blue, and I can take the red out!
You have ascended to the plateau of mediocrity. Behind me are the frozen remains of climbers who succumbed to attitude sickness and a thinly drawn atmosphere.
Come on, Mona... a little smile.
Stay still my friend. I've gotta get this right before the volcanoes bury you and your kind.
You STILL think it makes you look big?
Do something silly, it's a Boomerang.
Parietal picture or they won't believe you.
Hold still for just a few more minutes.
It's called 'forced' perspective! You know, like your critique?
I don't do impressionism!
I don't care if your inner spirit says " gym bunny".
How do you spell Mammuthus primigenius?
In the future, you'll be famous for fifteen minutes.
Very funny-No, I don't work for peanuts!
We will CGI the tusks in post...
Smile
I appreciate feedback, but for more effective chiaroscuro you need wait 20,000 more years.

You do the hokey pokey And you turn yourself around That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about
I am going to sign this the Task of the Tusk
You're still not smizing!
Sorry, I told the agency I still need a model that's wooly, with big curved tusks, like the last one they sent.
Christ...its called chiaroscuro. Satisfied?
I will call this miniature art.
It's not "Art" ... it's Politics. If it were "Art" I wouldn't still be a CAVE MAN, now would I ?
Pretty crude I know but remember this is the Stone Age.
Cheeeeeeese.
Nobody said this would be easy. You want to be immortal or not??
Just five more minutes and I will make you immortal.
Stop moving! I am just learning to draw tusks!
Everybody's a critic, sheesh!
Hey Gronk... check with the modeling agency. We asked for a Wooly Mammoth, but I think they sent us a measly Mastodon.
I am only able to paint a profile.
A Little to your left please

No! I can’t make you look skinnier!
Yeah, I know it's not your 'good side'...but what's important here is that you be facing the past.
Because until I have Auto-CAD, I can't make it 3-dimensional.
Fuhgeddiboudit!
OK, I'll knock off a few pounds.
I don't do portraits.
You are not getting my best features, now try again. Lets do a little better next time.
I want to see all your teeth not just the two
You are my mammoth muse and don't ever forget it
Turn your head a little to the left...
Look, the deal was you can stay warm in here but you have to remain still.
Hush. Your supposed to appear for another 500.000 years.
That's a boar, not an elephant! Get a day job because you stink as a cave artist.
I'm looking for a more natural look. So you can drop all the pretensions! ....and those tusks if you please!
I told you to keep your trunk hard. Is this how you want to be remembered?!
Hey, don't forget to keep still!
Hey. You don't have to remember everything.

I keep telling you: look like you're angry. ANGRY! Think of something that makes you mad.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you, a cave wall adds ten pounds.

So? Some of us find a little reminder helpful, once in a while.
Enough already with the selfies!
You moved your trunk again!
This is part of the algorithm...
Listen, I don't care how many covers you've modeled. I built you this fire so you could find your light.

Sorry it's a bad likeness. There's no such thing as art school.

I said, don’t move during your portrait. How could you forget that?
This is the last Elephant in the Room
I'll do two more and you can choose the one you like.

What do you mean not stately enough?
The lifestyle is okay but the pay is peanuts.
An artist needs the bear necessities
Thank you for coming over on such short notice. My earlier subject had too much junk in her trunk.

No I am not deweaponizing reality. This is the daycare cave.
Aw yes, I've done it"... " I've made me another, know i have more food then just one of these beast

Make yourself at home, dude. One hour of modeling gets you a gourmet cave salad of fruit, leaves, shoots, bark & roots, how's that?
Please spread the word that I'm giving 10% discounts on commissions.

This is you and your kind .... this is my kind ...... and your kind will die out.
I think you over did it on the Viagra Big Boy!
No ivory competition.
Turn sideways. It's way too early for me to have any perspective on you.
Stay still, this will immortalize you.
Hold still. It's the only way I can get this drawing done...and prevent you from eating me.
Believe me Lady, it will be priceless.
Sorry, I didn’t notice it was right over the fire.
I’m sorry, “artistic license” can only do so much.
No worries. The scetch puts on 10 pounds.
It was love at first sight !

Oh yeah? Well, he who smelt it dealt it!
The stone wall adds ten pounds.
Does this make you look fat?
Are you sure you don't want a larger portrait? I can do larger, up to 2 or your feet in size.
It's a mammoth portrait all the same.
No one will believe the P T Barium would so day name you Jumbo.
Its a primitive painting it is suppose to be stylistically simple and naive
Believe me, if we match your tusk & your hoof size, they'll never know about the other problem?
Should I make you look a little taller so you don't appear to be obese?
Pay Attention. You never remember anything
I thought you were wise? It's called a selfie. Now stay still.
Smile, Mona
Be still I have to get those tusks just right for posterity.
I still don't want to talk about you!
Keep still. You look more like an elephant -- whatever that is.
First one over the Alps. This one goes on the front page!
You put one foot in front of the other.
I love how intricate the painting is. It's visual poetry.
Trust me you look better without your tusks
I have an extensive spear collection we could peruse instead.
It symbolizes how she never wants to talk about my paintings.
People loved my cat paintings, but I didn’t love those people.

No...by the time this found graffiti will be considered in art.
You know I'm not good at realistic portraits.
I'm only putting the mouse in the drawing for scale.
The oven is standard.
If this works out, cave-dwellers hence will pray to this image for power.
To Scale? You don’t have that that long!
You know it always adds ten pounds.
These new 5 kilobristle brushes are just fantastic!
I think your slogan should be "Four More Years!"
No...pass it here, I’ll do a selfie
Small tusks look really strange at first, but trust me, it will be the new normal.
I don't want to be captioned...Do you?
I am making you small because you are not kosher.
I'm going to need a banana for scale.
Hold still or it will look like a stick figure.
Don't be ridiculous. Horns or tusks, you choose.
Good Lord! I'm not that fat!
this thing's for the ages man; don't ask me to make it obscene
Everyone is posting a picture of themselves, am going to post your picture and change the game of the walls and be the talk of the caves
I said, "Trunk Out!" Can't you remember anything?
No one is going to believe that your horns are THAT long.
That’s right, Woolly. No one draws mammoths like I do.
Framed? That's five bucks extra.
If you can only remember, DUMBO, I did say twice ‘bring Air-brush’ . Sorry the trunk will not work!
Smile for Daddy, say cheese, let's see those pearlies.
You are amazing! And how long were his tusks?
a remarkable example of modern art
Nobody will ever believe that you're just a baby
I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.
What do you want me to do, make you look like a stick?
I paint only in profile. Sorry.
Because some of us need help to remember things.
Can't you paint inside the lines?!
Don't just stand there pick up a pant Pot and Blow.
Yes, it's your good side and no, nobody likes a pachyderm with thin skin.
Would some pornography help?
How does signing B.C sound for "Bi.Cusp?"
Could you just move an inch to the left?
Smile! You're on Candid Camera!
It's not really so hard to hold your trunk out straight. So do it!
No, you may not wear a tutu.
Be patient, I made a D on my Famous Artist's test.
Get the hell outta here! You're the model, I'm the artist. You just stand there and smile.
For the last time, stop moving your trunk!
It's called post-modernism, okay?
You can fahgettaboud any peanuts until this thing is carved in stone.
Sorry, I don't have enough ink to do you justice.
Wait. How do you spell mammoth? I always get that one wrong.

Sir, this drawing will later help to illustrate the effectiveness of our company's woolly mammoth hair restoration process.
The special includes two wallet-sized.
Sorry, bur I've already booked the rhino.
You should have just stopped when you discovered that fire.
You can take a cave room break right now.
Well, if you'd stop moving...
This is the last one. No more pictures on our wall!
Gosh
That's a dirty trick to barbecue my trunk!!
I can’t wait ‘til they see this!
This is how you'll look once the swelling goes down.
Another break? People won’t say it’s a masterpiece if I finish after the Ice Age is over!
Less of a smile! I told you we are going for enigmatic here.
Will you please stop moving and get back into position. I am trying to capture details here.
Stop complaining! What am I, Picasso?
Can’t you chisel faster? I’ll be extinct before you finish
I want you to promise me you won't forget this.
What? Make the tusks bigger? Okay, okay. Geez, take it easy, lard ass.
I’m tweeting. I hate fake news, my GOP friend.
Hey, you said you wanted a selfie, so, hold still.
Move a bit to the right , will ya ?
BIGGER
The Search party? Oh, yes. We just seated them. They were unusually bitter about their FRUITLESS day and all seemed to finally agree it was DESSERT TIME. So I brought them a bowl of berries. berries.
Hold still! I want this political junk mail ad to look perfect before we visit the next cave.
This new paleo diet is killing my models.
I’m sorry, but pictures always make you look 10 pounds heavier.
Stay still; I'm mastodon.
those tusks are too hard to draw
Do you want me to draw you a picture of the plane? And to explain why you don’t have to remember your name to accompany me as my emotional support animal?
Ray Romano? What’s a Ray Romano?
I'm cave painting you like one of my French mammoths.
No I said draw me like one of your French girls, Jack!
What? But 'Me' is only one syllable.
I'll paint your better side once you're roasted.
Look here! I might not be Yousuf Karsh, but I AM pretty good.
Hey! I told you to stand still!
Hold still , dammit ! I'm almost done!

No girls. No peanuts. This is one night I will be forgetting, Fred.
Ugh, you got my nose all wrong.
I know it's hot but I need the light.
I said, “on three say cheese” NOT “on three cut the cheese”!!
I agree, you’re better looking than this.
OK, take your break.
Left your glasses again ? This is his first of four ex-wives!
No, I'm not making you look like Napoleon; but, frankly, you could be confused with a Republican.
Now, don't move or you'll ruin it.
This is the girl I remember.
Get the Fluffer! His trunk is down again.
My foyer is not really a "room", and you are not here anyway.
What do you mean, it's not big enough?
You are a much more cooperative model than the last dinosaur.
The mammoth whisperer apologizes as he writes down his behavioural impression
What do you mean, ‘swipe left’?
And i'm spent. Can you come back on Thursday?
No, you cannot go out and play...and furthermore, where is the rest of your herd?
You can TiVo Survivor Pangea. The game's about to start.
I trust you won't forget, but the brush really does add ten pounds.
One more crack like that and I'll plaster you.
Stay still or in 50,000 years people won’t mention you are in the room !
There. Is that better?
Millions of years later, persons with teeth will rip your tusks out.
They just can't get my nose right.
Hold Still, Hold Still, why? You're drawing looks like a toddlers' no matter how still I am.
Why do you make me do this? They're gonna clone you anyway.
So ... I’m trying to capture your natural lighting, I may need to move the fire.
So how do you like this picture of yourself?
They LOVE you SO much. They all want an itsy elephant carving for their coffee tables. One hitch - they're willing to saw off your face to get one.
Yes, you are impressive. But you're no woolly mammoth.
Move your trunk a little to the left, please.
Don't forget to paint my "other" trunk.
Can you sit.those tusks are making me very nervous.
Tusk enhancement, huh? I'm doing you au naturel.
Oh Jack, paint me like on of your neolithic girls.
Everyone is an art critic.
Don't tusk it up.
A little to the left please, that's it, that's it. :)
Can't you remember to hold still!
Are you sure you want me to shop your nose?
The last guy drew me running away from a mouse. He still hasn't forgotten what I did to him.
Original "Man-splaining".
stand still! i need to get your good side
I told you Nose Up
Ok, I'm putting you in but not those hot things you brought in here, whatever they might be.
Shall I draw your mammoth as is?
We have bears and bulls at the market already. What’s your gig.
Whadaya mean it doesn't look like you?
The lighting in here is lousy.
Hey Who is the Master here Don!
Elephant thinking "This session isn't helping my mouse problem..."
There's this idea in portraiture that you have to put your subject at ease. I just don't agree.
I told you to wait in the car
Well, sir, I see a Picasso you're not.
Well if you won’t blow your own trumpet...
Tusks? No this is a glance into your future.
Try not to blink.
Paint me like one of your cave women.
Learning about the self is the most beneficial education you can aquire.
I feel like you're not taking this seriously enough. How about a little more tusk?
What?! The fire adds ten pounds.
You have a nice profile.
I don’t think airbrushing has been invented yet.
I'm trying to get your best side.
Just hold still––and I won't charge you.
I know, I know, but you didn't tell me this was an ivory-free zone!
I know today's a summer Friday, but I can't just spell that out for them.
This campaign spend will be a waste of money if you can’t play to the moderates.
Help me!! There's a wholly mammoth in our cave! Never let a wholly mammoth get in our cave again!
Yes, i know the light adds 10 pounds!
You don't mind if I show you what's under my dress, do you?
This is why you should have asked Kehinde Wiley or Amy Sherald!
I want you to draw me like one of your mastodon girls.
Hold still, please.
Hold still & keep your trunk up!
The light really captures your eyes.
You're half the animal I was looking for.
The light captures your essence... oh, and please remember how invented fire.
Enlightenment begins with an entree and coffee.
You’ll get more arugula when I’m finished!
Yes,I do blend all my own feces.
I'm experimenting with a new style that I call realism.
Show inner you.
I'm sorry, I don't have any filters.
No I won't make it bigger for your FaceBook page!
Can you turn sideways, pleaase?
For the last time - will you please hold still!
Would you rather I draw a spherical cow?
This lighting won't do, the fire is too bright.
You’re photo bombing my selfie
Draw me like one of your French girls.
You must leave NOW! But we'll always have Paris.
What do you think? Have I captured the real you?
I'm sorry, 3-D hasn't been discovered yet.
No, for your information, I don’t have tusk envy
Man's first attempt to obtain ivory.
Could you turn s bit to the right?
Hey, I never said I was a Michelangelo.
The task of your tusks is difficult
Do you wanna be the new Republican mascot or not? They said "No tusks!"
I'm sure I've seen that smile before, somewhere.
Yet again, I say you are a mastodon and not a masta, you slang-loving, egotistical mammal.
Smile for the peanut gallery!
Don't worry, the paintbrush adds ten pounds.
Now ask me, 'who is the fairest one of all.'
Mona Jumbo, let me get that smile right!
Stay still! First I draw you. THEN I roast you.
If you keep glaring at me like that you’re going to come across as a massive jerk, not me
Next I need a reward amount and a contact number.
No, my name goes first...
I’m sick and tired of this same depressed expression whenever you model
Vanity will be a sin.
Coffee, tea, or me?
I’ll write this down for your sake, but I’m all set. I’ve got the memory of a goldfish.
Keep your trunk still, dammit. How do you expect me to get it right?
Some day you'll be a political symbol because of my artwork.
I'm just not feeling the look. How long would it take you to lose those tusks.
Anyway, I read on last week's wall that thigh gaps aren't "in" anymore
I just don’t want my charcoal to go off the cave.
Show some patience! Not only will you remember what you look like, you'll be immortal.
No, I think the tusks make you look thinner.
No one wants a flaccid nude displayed on their wall.
Horns, tusks! Whatever! I should have spent more time in art school learning to draw them!
hold still. I'm almost done.
Wipe that smile off your trunk, dude. Primordial art is serious business!!
I know you don’t need a painting to remember me. Humor me, okay?
I'm going to charge u more if you keep moving
We just served the last dinner, the kitchen is closed.
Woolly? Do I look like a sheep?
I SAID "STAND STILL"!!!
A little to the left...
That does not look like a French girl Jack.
Please don’t move the tusks.
I told you; it is post-fire genre
I just do donkeys.
I said "werk it"!
Hold still, I'm working on the symmetry !
Hold still. My New Year's resolution was to start a food diary.
I feel like I missed a wrinkle.
I'm starting to think these "Found Mastodon" signs won't be worth your owner's reward.
There is justice in this world. Because right after you go extinct, we go extinct.
Make sure to get my good side
Ugly neandrathal! I forsee you evolving into a donkey.
You're wiggling.
Hands off if she's under 18
This is how society wants to see you.
Come on, I could do a better job than that!
It’s block chain bit tusk.
I'm sure no one will even mention it.
That better not be my wife you're painting.
Tsk, Tsk. To address the elephant in the room, "What is the biggest threat to our coal industry?"
Its not my fault you look like an elephant!
Would you mind tilting your head up a tad?
Remember, A is for archaeopteryx, B is for brachiosaurus, C is for caudipteryx, D is for diceratops, and E is for elephant!
I can't draw you any bigger - I have't invented a ladder yet!
1) What do you mean, this must be my "flat period"? 2) I call it a "portrait". And just what the heck is 'emotional impressionism'? 3) No, there's only one color, I named it 'mud'.
My therapist says this’ll help me conquer my fears.
I don't care about posterity. It will not have your precious tusks.
I don't care if it's you, it's my drawing.
No, I can't spell Mammuthis primigenius.
Wow these police sketch artist are amazing
Hold still, these tusks aren’t going to carve themselves.
You can go take a bathroom break now.
Don't move, there's a fireball coming and its going to cause mammoth changes.
As a meme it might catch on.
I'm sorry, I forgot your selfie stick.
In this moment we are having a technical crisis. Thankfully our crew and lassie our assisting to help bring a solution to the problem. Please remain patient and once again we are sorry for the inconvenience.
No, I'm not adding a six-pack.
Relax. You know the cave wall adds two hundred pounds.
So I’m left handed, sue me.
It’s your profile. P-R-O-F-I-L-E.
I wonder if I’ll be remembered as the author of the first republican billboard.
Of course it doesn't look like you - I'm a cubist.
Stop fidgeting, or I'll never get your profile right!
Try to hold still. You haven't got all day, you know.
Don't worry....the curve of the wall makes your trunk in the fire light look smaller.
I pictured you with bigger ears, actually!
Most of us agreed it was high time you got downsized.
If I want your opinion, I’ll ask for it.
So does that mean you guys are allowed to date others people?
So... do I add the party hat or not?
Back off. You see the wall about cats painting and now all right of a sudden you’re an artist.
Tuskless and small. Save this. Someone could use this 10,000 years from now and call it "Resistance."
Thanks for doing this. My wife won't talk to me since the last time I pulled her hair.
Yeah, I know. The chisel always adds five pounds.
Representational is the only style those Neanderthals can appreciate.
Sorry, I don't have room.
As soon as I finish this billboard, you’ll get calls.
The only problem is you can’t eat it.
It's called outsider art and someday you'll be famous.
If you don't keep your trunk up no one will recognize you.
Which one are you pointing to?
No worries, if there's anything you don't like, I can always Photoshop it.
Oh, yeah? Well it wouldn't TAKE eons to complete if you'd hold still!!
Stop fidgeting and hold that pose. Chances are you'll be extinct soon.
You're doing great, but could you remove your skirt too?
If you don't stand still I'll make a carving out of your tusks.
Well, it's not really a selfie since you didn't paint it yourself.
Perfect! Don't move.
Can you move your tusk a little to the left, please?
ARTIST SAYS: It's extra to leave the tusks out.
Uhh, you’ve turned a little too far to the right.
Why, because your future looks bright.
Well, I've tried, Bosco, but somehow I don't think this captures the real you!
That's right... my art bring attention to the elephant in the room!
Hold still. Elephant's these days.
What, so now you _do_ want it “tusks and all”?
Remember how we made fuschia?
Yeah, looks about right.
Stop it, just stay still, I'm more wooly than you with ever be.
Hold that pose for me.
And unless she rumbles assent keep your trunk to yourself.
Your brush strokes need work
Put that thought out of your mind! It changes everything.
It's always easier to vote a straight ticket !
My nose isn't that big!
?"Don't move, I'm drawing this week's menu".
'Why can you never remember to keep still?'
so you want headshots to apply to this new party?
What are you smiling about?
Because you're cross-eyed, and I'm not.
Stand still. Kou can go out and play later.
Do you think that cave drawing makes me look fat?
You keep forgetting to hold still
Make my tusks bigger
You'll always be my first.
#nofilter
You were right, your left side looks the best in this cave light.
Hey!! What did I tell you about downloading inside?!
You looked more intimidating on the cave security hieroglyphic site.
Can you be still or do I have to threaten you with exstinction?
we'll play fetch after drawing time
A bald woolly mammoth? I've got to post this on my wall.
Stay still or this could take eons.
This is how WE never forget, , hunting you to extinction.
Yes Madam, I know you’ll be extinct soon! But don’t worry, I got your good side!
The carving adds ten pounds.
Yes, he stopped by and yes, I took a message.
Ladies on the walls. Good idea.
Look, we're all migratory -- but hold still another minute for the tusks, will you?
Next time you'd better come back for a longer sitting.
Mammoth with Fire, Mammoth with Fire. Mammoth with Fire. Just once I wish they'd let me draw the three-headed Dragon or the helicopter.
It's "The Secret"
Pay? This is an unpaid internship.
Turn a tad to your left, please.
it's not suppose to be a photograph, you know.
Yeah well, if your memory is so great, how do you spell mastodon?!
God you're ugly.
You won’t pay my commission unless I make your tusks look larger than who?
This is a ten minute pose.
Relax, it's the maquette.
Someday we'll be famous. Just hold still a bit longer.
If you share this on Instagram, I do request a credit.
If I draw your tusks I have to start all over. It's just a doodle, who cares?
I promise you, you don't look fat!
Stay still! You will be ffamous in the next millenium.
Babies don't have tusks, do they?
Stop moving, so I can get this right !
My bad. I should have drawn you facing to the right.
Why do you care how long your legs are when you’re extinct?
Maybe not, but this will still be here long after you're extinct.
Don’t expect Tarpans special teams will just roll over like the Aurochs did Sunday.
Forget about the bigger trunk and tusks, today its all about mileage economy!
This is you on the Paleo diet.
Move a tiny bit to the right
Hold still. This needs to look good for at least 40,000 years.
How am I going to capture your essence if you won't stay still?
Draw me Jarry.
The Elephant says "make sure you get my good side"
Don't get your tusks in an uproar. I'm workin' for peanuts too.
you want to look more regal? jeez, how picky do elephants get? my dad taught me, not some professional artist.
Slow, even, calm breaths and hold your trunk straight!
I don't care if TRUMP is a liddle word!
You've come a long way baby!
I'm painting the one who's outside.
Stop wining, this is modern realism.
When I'm done we'll talk about the mammoth in the room.
I don't care what you say, I 'm the stable genius here!
Keep still. I wanna get the mouth right.
A little to the left. Try to look a little more hopeful.
Maybe lean in a little closer at the tar pit next time because I think it's a great likeness!!!
Why don't you go back to the peanut gallery?
I need to paint this one. It’s so rare to find an elephant with tusks in place, unchained, or not performing the tricks these days.
I'm making your tusks bigger to really impress modern man.
If you won't hold the pose, I'll shove your trunk in the fire again!'
Don't worry, I will paint you look better than elephant.
The dim upwards lighting from the fire will help project t-- oh forget it. It'll never be as good as the Obama's.
Paleo-Artisinal-MFA Program, Brooklyn, NY, 2018
sorry, I can't do hands
I make you look sympathetic, Mastodon Corleone.
Now let's have that fabulous Mona Lisa smile.
Do I bore you?
Lascaux get a fern frappé when we get done here.
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your woolly mammoths.
The first Presidential portrait. Evyn, AAHS, Alexandria, MN There's an elephant in the room. Hunter, AAHS, Alexandria, MN
No, I can't make you look ten tons lighter
If you wanted life-size, we should have leased a two-bedroom.
They 're supposed to be primitive.
Smile, damnit
Oh, boy!
For an extra $20, you can get both the trunk a/nd the penis. Your call.
How much longer until realism is invented?
One day we'll both be rich and famous.
Don't worry, the cave paint always adds about ten pounds.
Keep smiling. It'll look better in time to come.
"for the last time" your tusk are normal size
The lighting adds a few pounds.
It's too small? No problem. Wait till they photo-shop it!
Draw me like one of your french prehistoric beasts.
It's the price you pay for coming in to get warm.
Your not going to last forever . . The First Selfie
They said this paint would last 30 thousand years, but I think we'll be lucky to make it to the neolithic era.
New to modeling nude?
Don't mean to rush, but I told the agency to send over a Rhino.
Ask me that after your first cup of coffee.
Bundling hasn't changed a thing. Spiritual advice was already dying.
2/26/18: "Do you have a reservation?"
I'll be done, in about a third of the sundial.
I need a fierce 'I Remember You' look
you can't go extinct on me now
It does NOT make you look fat!
This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual events, locales, proboscideans, or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.
Another coked-up, pachyderm B-Lister! I should have stayed in the gravel pit!
Someday someone will say something dumb like ‘life imitates this.’
Strom Thurman's first polictical ad
Can you hold that pose, for about a month?
In a few millennia, one one will even remember you had them!
Does anyone know how to draw 3-D?
Hold still. I need to get the tusks right before the limestone-ash pigment dries.
Uh yeah, I was TOTALLY NOT doing a painting of me hunting you no no, this is a painting of us singing kumbaya!The bow and arrow is a gift to you!
Quit asking me to draw you like one of my French girls!
Oh yeah? Here's the brush. Let's see how good YOU are.
I can make it look puny, or make it look like Bargh. Not both.
Take a cave painting, it'll last longer!
Years from now, cavers will say you had a beautiful profile!
I wish you would remember to hold still.
I'll never get this right if you don't stop moving!
Ok, take a break. I have to add the part you don't want to see and would never forget.
Hey, hey, take it easy. The pigment always adds ten pounds.
Put your trunk back up and turn right.
With tusks like that, you'll become famous in no time.
Listen, if you want me to do a miniature of you, I at least need you to hold your pose.
Back in two-dimensional pose, damn it!
Don't worry—you're on the verge of extinction. I'll take in your waistline.
You remind me of my baby mammoth video clip.
I'm not done yet. Then you can draw me.
Better to paint .... because killing is easy, the hard is to remove the body.
Please wipe that lescaux off our P Wipe that Lescaux off your face.
Hey! I told you. I wanted a horse!!!!...
Of course you'll be remembered. Someday you'll symbolize the greatness of our time.
I've heard of obscene art, but Pleistocene art?!
I'm an artist - don't talk to me about gentrification!
You didn't even get my good side
Waah! My trunk is tired, my trunk is tired! Try to hold the pose this time, please!
I'm a Mastodon, I'm a Mastodon, not Mammoth...Okay, Okay...sheesh...hold still Mammoth.
What do you mean, "delete that," it's totally your angle!
Teen years suck. I'm going to make you a self-help wall. It will show you what to expect. I'm going to start with you as a baby and end when you'll be older and woolly.
Print or cursive?
This likeness will have to do -- at least until mirrors are invented.
Let me finish this little guy first, before I draw the second half of your torso.
Should I draw you being speared or me trampled?
Hold still; I need this for the insurance claim.
It's not my fault you broke your selfie stick.
PLEASE, I need to see alittle more swing and hip movement !
“Tantor?” Would that be with one “n” or two?
Give me a minute....Yes you have really really long horns
I don't care if it's too warm in here. Tusks up!
Stay still Kodak while I draw your picture
I've been called the Leonardo da Vinci of my time.
I get it, I'm not Da Vinci. And you ain't Mona Lisa!
I promise, we'll play All Around the Mastodon as soon as I finish this cave-mail.
I think this baby portrait thing might really have a future.
Stop moving! I'm not creating a video.
Believe me, some time in the future, you will be the one thing people can't not think about. Now keep your head up and smile.
How come you look more like an elephant than a mastadon?
If you don't stop moving, tonight I will be dining on your liver with Fava Beans and a nice Chianti
You could at least try an enigmatic smile.
My friends will be so jealous when they find out I was the first one to put a picture of what's for dinner on the wall.
Everyone knows caves drawings takes off 10 tons of your weight.
I’m selling them outside every touristic cave in Pangea.
This is why, no dating until you are 21.
Hang in there! I should expect peanuts for this black and white version.
You’re just staring; give me something more dynamic.
Don't give me that look. I never went to art school.
OK, turn your head a little to the right. Perfect, don't move.
Lay off the peanuts you're getting a little tusky!
Do pay attention, double-0 seven.
I think I know a thing or two about expressing truth in wool, Kevin!
2018 SpaceX’s heavy launch soon - Elly the great, lasting impression on earth.
Alright, now give me that zoo-landerlook, you big baby!
Entra nous. I'm going to call it, "The Mammoth in the Cave."
This piece will be on display until the next ice age. Would it hurt you to smile a little?
1. STOP FIDGITING. . . .OR WAS THAT AN EARTHQUAKE ? 2. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN! THEY'RE ENTRANCING, LIKE DEEP POOLS OF LAVA!
What exactly do you mean by "Tsk, Tsk"?
it's called Artistic License. In this scene I am the Mighty Hunter
Awright already! Writer’s block. Let’s see you come up with a tale!
Let's begin with the ground rules, shall we?
So, have you ever used Task Mastodon before?
A little more to the left!
Trust me, they are all going to stampede right.
Let's label it "Selfie -- #NoFilter".
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm trying to capture the ESSENCE of who you are!
i am sure you remember at one time you were this size.
Can you move your head a little to the left? You’re blocking the light.
I don't care if you're horny ! Stand still!
Yes it IS your portrait, but after you pay me you won't have any tusks. So NO TUSKS!
Can you tilt the tusks aside slightly and show me a bit of that grand old smile?
The beginning of Van Gogh.
Mind if I air-brush the droopy nose?
So what's different about me?
You look fine. The charcoal adds 10 pounds
"my what large tusks you have" Hold still or you will be dinner.
Well yes, but I have to draw something or they'll get suspicious. Now hold up those tusks!
I told you, the
I know what you are thinking. FORGET IT, if you can!
What do you mean by “temporary”?
OK - ready for your close-up!
??Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you??
You call that a "come hither" look?
I tried the idea of square before but our people are so primitive for that!
It's a mammoth, not a mastodon.
I know you're tired...Just a few minutes more...
When I'm done, this will be a masterpiece across time!
Sure, we could move to Lascaux, but they're all about the tusks there.
Smile, Dammit, Smilr
Remember she exists only in your memory.
Someday your future ancestors won't have a pair of tusks and a long snout.
They won't be able to tell that you're a Mastodon, not .a Mammoth!
It would look better if you didn't move so much!
Hold still! Soon you will be extinct and I won' t be able to draw you!
No, absolutely not, Pachyderm cartoons are not a thing!
If you trim back the tusks, the trunk would look a lot bigger.
I’m bored too! So, stand still
OK, so forget 'fierce'. Try 'brutal'.
If you stood still, the likeness would be a lot better.
Don't worry! If it doesn't come out quite right, I can fix it in Cavepaintshop.
Now tell me about your attacker's tusks.
First you pose for Daddy's picture -- then walkies.
Is that you're best side.
I have no choice, Rex - the genre will be "nude portrait". And that's final!!
Trust me, the nude is in vogue.
Yeah I know the world is ending, but art takes time.
I said stop moving!
No, my background scenery landscapes haven't arrived yet.
It's to honor you for giving us fire.
They'll take of the wrinkles in post.
Shall I include the cavity in your right tusk?
I'm warning you: If you don't stop moving, I won't give you any mammoth tusks.
Could you get your nose back up and your incisors in... please.
You need to look more ferocious,my reputation is on the line!
Yes, you get to stay for dinner.
I was going to wallpaper it but just couldn't ignore the elephant in the room.
"Yes! Restraining Order means don't lose your pet", said the Caveman to the Woolly Mammoth.
Well I know you asked me to paint you like one of my French girls but there's only so much I can do.
Congratulations, you will be the entree feature this week!
I can do Impressionist, Expressionist, Cubist, Pop Art, Graffiti style. You tell me what you want.
Can you make the ears a little bigger?
Translate translate that.
Est only la couleur I aive.
The way you created a selfie in prehistoric times.
Good to see you’ve evolutionized, as for your artistry? Eh.
the inner you is smaller and timid
OK. You're were right. It was a mistake to vote for Trump.
Yes, it's reruns until the fall season.
Can you please make your tusks stop growing so fast?
You didn't get my trunk right!
Domesticating household pets began in our earliest days
Who cares if I got the trunk wrong! How long's it gonna last, 20,000 years?
Hey! Don't criticize my portrait of you! They'll come a time when you'll be cursed at for symbolizing a powerful gang of mainly old racist and sexist rich white men.
Evolving without the tusks means your species will survive. We apparently will evovle to using only part of our brains, so we will need you.
Resembling this- just a lot larger.
So what? It's a political cartoon!
But your nose gives you character.
Stand still, you think it's easy to chisel
Your butt IS fat!
Better not call my next painting, “Elephant in the Cave.”
Yeah, that's it. No tusks. And make my nose smaller, if you don't mind.
Maybe next Valantine’s we could tell everybody that ... you know ... we are realy good friends?
Look, this is the best ya' gonna do until someone invents numbers.
Yeah, I know it's not so great, but this is my first time, after all.
When you grow up you will thank me
I know, Sir, you expect your presidential portrait to be huge – but Congress won't pay for it.
Could you back up a bit?
I'm warning you if you don't stand still you'll go extinct.
With or without tusks.
Sorry, but I don't see you thin.
_I_ didn't tell you to manscape your wool off.
Just you! I don't give a damn about the shadow of the fire.
Do you remember this suspect?
Hey, Trunk up! You’re gonna love it. It’s just bad lighting!
a frame?...what's a frame?
What did you expect? You didn't pay me for this.
Relax. It's a rough draft. I'll add persepctive as soon as it this cold spell is over.
Now give me that come hither look.
Après Picasso, THAT’s what I call it!
A little more “smile” and we’re good...............
...and this is why in 5000 year your kind will go extinct
Okay, okay! It IS life imitating art!
Be still, my Muse
"Pull that wool off your ears! I said your future is hairless, not heirless".
I said paint me like one of your French woolly mammoths.
Have you tried the Paleo diet?
This is your best side, it takes at least a hundred pounds from you!
If you want life-size, stand still.
“Be still. My action figures aren’t selling well”.
Please lower your tusks a bit.
Now please turn, for your next profile.
Elephants don't get modern art.
for your PREVIOUS contest: "Sorry, we don't provide ties."
You have to go around to the back entrance to apply for a job.
i will try to make you smaller -but still charge the same price
If this is a good likeness of your missing child, I'll paint it on every cave wall until she's found.
I think I'm a little off with the size.
Sorry...I can’t do anything about all the wrinkles. Photoshop won’t be invented for another 10,000 years.
Yes, my picture is small. And, no, I don't have tusk envy.
Could you lower those tusks a little?
Yeah, yeah. Everybody's an art critic these days.
Yes, they WILL be this short after I burn them to make my Ivory Black!
hold that pose
Tusk off, fat boy! It's my art – I'll do it how I want!
Think that's exciting? wait until I draw my wife.
Lose the tusks!
Hey, quit moving!
I’m a freakin’ cave man, not DaVinci, for cryin’ out loud!
You need to loose weight or backup, I’m running out of paint!
Not to worry, it's a thumbnail.
What do you mean you can't get your trump, sorry I mean trunk up again?

It's a textbook case--depending on which state your textbooks are from.
I suspect some people will deny this ever happened.
The coroner said it occurred sometime between 360 million years ago and 4am.
It's Kansas, m'am. Evolution is a crime.
I wouldn't have expected this in a million years.
Say what you will, he died a man.
This case goes back further than we thought.
Mind you, it's just a theory.
Looks like the past finally caught up with him.
It's going to take a while to notify all the next of kin.
A billion years of evolution and they still don't look both ways...
Looks like a textbook case — except in Texas.
No jury in Tennessee will believe it.
We suspect the cause of death was natural selection.
We have to improve our response time.
Well, at least we have a timeline.
Witnesses say it all started with a big bang.
Just when he got on his own two feet.
I'll tell you one thing. This killer took his time.
Looks to me like he was running from his past.
There's a missing link here somewhere...
Obviously, it's an evolving crime scene.
Round up the usual fundamentalists.
Get Darwin from forensics on this. He may have a theory.
This didn't just happen over night.
We're waiting on the DNA results, but believe they were all related.
Looks like his past caught up with him.
Looks like the crime took place some time between 600 Million B.C. and 3 A.M.
Looks like his past caught up with him.
This one has Darwin’s fingerprints all over it!
Clearly, this is an evolving crime scene.
I guess we’ll see how this case evolves.
I can't help thinking we're missing a link here.
"We've been trying to get a stoplight at this intersection since the beginning of time.'
We'll have to notify the next of species
'Yeah, but why kill the other four? No way they were going to talk.'
Well, at least we can rule out the evangelicals.
Our witness claims it started with a Big Bang.
I estimate time of death somewhere between 10pm last night and the Middle Devonian Period.
We think the victims are all related.
Of course, it’s just a theory...
We've ruled out an act of God
Good luck establishing the time of death.
What a shame. He was making real progress.
This never happens in the Bible Belt.
God only knows what's next.
Start questioning relatives, no matter how distant.
The neighbors said they first heard a big bang.
Natural causes. Except for the last one, he was walking and texting.
We're looking for a single-celled organism with a helluva longstanding grudge.
The facts of this case are still evolving.
We do have a theory, but not everyone is going to accept it.
A witness said she heard a big bang.
At this point it's still just a theory.
OK, start from the beginning.
Witnesses say they heard a big bang.
Any theories?
Our suspect is a home-schooled white male carrying a Bible.
I still think we're missing a link.
Put a tail on him right away.
We may have a statute of limitations issue here.
Don't ask me what it means. I was home schooled.
Once again, from the beginning
Never thought I'd see anything like this in a billion years.
I’ve got a few theories but they keep evolving.
Get me all the security camera footage from the last five hundred million years.
So, the question is: random, or by design
I thought you said you had a tail on this guy.
This has Darwin written all over it.
The way I figure it, we got about 8 million years until he strikes again.
Well, down here evolution still is a crime
Three days to retirement and I get a 160 million-year cold case.
I've seen this before. These kinds of cases start out a little fishy, and eventually evolve.
We know the victim was here sometime between 11 pm last night and the early Palaeozoic Era.
Looks like they were shot with an evolver.
Yeah, we have a theory, ... but it's just evolving.
So sad... he was becoming a stand up guy...
...even if we solve the case... 38% of people won't believe it...
We need to find the missing link
Well, we'll have to notify the next of species
And you say that this all started after the neighbors heard a big bang.
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle...
They say all the victims were related.
Looks like his past finally caught up to him.
It appears the victim had a history.
One thing's for sure - it took longer than six days to pull this one off.
We think the victims may have been related.
I don't think we've seen the end of this.
We've got to improve our response time.
I think we can establish a timeline.
The question is: who's next?
If only we could find the missing link.
Whoever did this took their time.
Look, this is New York. If you’re gonna cross, cross. Don’t take ages.
Evolutionary, my dear Watson- evolutionary.
Remind me to tell Detective Darwin his humor isn’t appreciated by everyone.
If these murders are connected, I'm a monkey's uncle.
Based on the evidence at hand, we think the crime took place between 1 Billion years ago and last Tuesday around 9.15 PM.
I see a pattern evolving here.
Looks like he died of natural selection.
Round up all the Creationists in the area.
Apparently they were walking in single phylum when they were gunned down.
I tell ya, they just don’t teach you this stuff in school.
I wonder if they were related.
That must have been one slow-moving bus.
Looks like even the fittest didn't survive.
Evolutionary, My Dear Watson
I’ve been chasing this perp for seems like 600 million years.
The Medical Examiner places time of death between 4 hours and 360 million years ago.
It looks like the victims were naturally selected.
Keep the creationists away. They'll want to destroy the evidence.
Despite the evidence, it’s still just a theory.
I don't like where this is going
This didn't happen overnight.
Whoever did this was in no hurry.
It looks like his past finally caught up with him.
Looks like we can rule out creationists.
You expect me to believe this happened overnight?
It apparently took the police forever to get here.
Not even the fittest survive in this town.
The medical examiner estimates the time of death as between four million years to one hour ago.
This is the longest stretch of serial killings we've ever had.
Looks like they were killed by a higher-caliber evolver.
If we could only find the missing link.
Poor guy just got on his own two feet.
We really need to speed up our response times.
We also recovered a revolver, pointed stick, flint, molten lava and a bunch of slime.
The first thing you do in cases like this, Officer, is look for the missing link.
Whoever did this was in no hurry.
The murder weapon appears to be an evolver.
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle...
I'm not sayin' creationists did it; I'm just sayin' they had a motive
It appears this victim was shot with an evolver.
Yes, mark that down as an evolving crime scene.
Any idea if the victims are related?
My gut tells me it was all done with a evolver.
This was a crime years in the making.
Check if any of our suspects has a fossil record.
Call the time of death anywhere between 400 million B.C. and last night at 11 o'clock.
Well, we know one thing. He didn’t go quickly.
I'm curious to see how this case evolves.
They may all be related, but that’s just a theory
As you can see, the situation evolved quickly.
Get me a list of all nearby residents for the last 400 million years.
Well, we can rule out Pence.
I think the evidence in the case is still evolving.
For the life of me, I can't see a link.
Damn it Frank--I said we need proof, not a theory.
There must be a missing link.
So we know where he came from, but where was he going?
We're looking for the missing link, detective.
Forensic evidence shows the victims were all related.
Evolutionary, my dear Watson- evolutionary.
The theory is he died from natural selection.
No leads yet, but the case is evolving.
That's Darwin's M.O. all right.
So far all we know is that one was named Lucy.
Whoever committed this murder has been planning it for a long time.
The most tragic thing of all is that the fish knew it was a bad idea.
Well, the war on science has finally hit the streets...
4 Billion Years, but we finally caught him.
We believe the murders occured over an extended period of time.
It's a long story.
I'm homicide. You're going to have to call extinction.
This crime didn't just happen overnight.
Round up the usual species.
Looks like his past finally caught up to him.
We’ve found a suspect, but there seems to be a missing link
It was a rapidly evolving crime.
God knows who did it.
Find out where the Arkansas Board of Education was last night.
Neighbors say they heard a big bang.
I'd put time of death between noon yesterday and 3.5 billion years ago.
This isn't random. The killer went after the whole family tree.
Thought I had a handle on this case, but it just keeps evolving...
No definite leads yet. The case is still evolving.
From the looks of it, I'd say it took him quite a long time to die.
I suspect the fish is a red herring.
This may turn out to be the crime of the centuries.
God knows who might be next.
Lady in the shop says it started with a big bang.
I'm afraid this crime is still evolving.
Well so much for survival of the fittest.
Eye witnesses said they were run down by someone driving a Genesis.
We're running the DNA now, but it appears that the victims were all related.
This was a cold-blooded killing. Warm-blooded also.
Witnesses report hearing a big bang.
OK, officer, take me through the time-line from the beginning...
On the plus side, it should be quite a while before he strikes again.
I think we're all wondering, what's next?
You're right officer. This intersection has been dangerous for a long, long time.
I'd investigate, but this is Texas.
These weren't just random victims, they were selected. And they were selected naturally.
We should get the DNA back from the lab soon, but for now, it appears the victims were all related.
Round up the usual fundamentalists.
I’m afraid of what might happen next.
No, I'm not certain, it's just a theory.
The weapon was dusted for opposable thumb prints.
Someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look like natural selection.
I told you this crime would start out fishy and evolve into something more complex...
It appears that his past caught up with him
I still don't buy it. There has to be a missing link!
Let's start at the beginning.
We need to stop this guy, and soon. I have a feeling he's getting smarter.
Looks like he was shot with an evolver.
I have a theory, but it'll be damned hard to prove.
Sure it's just a theory, but damn it, it's the best we've got.
It could be murder — or just natural selection.
all we've found so far is a carbon footprint
It’s evolutionary my dear officer Watson.
If for any reason I say this case is "evolving," I want you to punch me in the neck.
The question is: who's next?
Shame--he was on his way to becoming an upright citizen.
Call Darwin at forensic, he'll have his own theory on this.
Evolutionary, My Dear Watson
This case just keeps evolving.
Round up the usual Darwinists.
The evidence is still evolving. At least that's the theory.
Looks like evolution really is dead.
No big mystery here, Detective. It was only a matter of time.
So much for the survival of the fittest.
I think this case is evolving.
We believe the crime took place sometime between the Cambrian Explosion and 5:00 p.m. yesterday.
We’ve fixed the time of death at between 65 million years ago and last Tuesday
Good news.. we've narrowed down the time of death to somewhere between a billion years ago to 8:56pm tonight
Our suspect clearly took his time.
Now keep in mind, it's only a theory.
When the mob says they'll go after your family, they mean it.
Find out how the victims were connected.
Time of death was between 30 million BC and 2 a.m.
This is our oldest unsolved case.
The real tragedy is that now the world will never know what he might have become.
Our understanding of the motive is still evolving.
This new evidence seems to clear Adam and Eve
Check whether anybody saw or heard anything unusual in the last 100 million years.
I suspect our perpetrator has been at this for some time.
We seem to be missing a link.
He must have been in deep. They don't usually go after the relatives.
No crime of passion here - this was carefully planned for eons.
Whoever did this trailed him for ages.
That’s life.
Proving it won’t be easy.
What are we missing?
Let's not rule out intelligent design.
The coroner says the victims were all related.
Well, the case is definitely evolving.
Looks like we need to go back to the beginning to solve this one.
Round up the usual evangelicals.
In this case we just need to find the missing link.
I think we're looking for a Creationist.
Let's just wait and see how this evolves.
Granted, this is just a theory.
Establishing the time of death might be difficult
At first I thought it was a random shooting but my theory is evolving.
Looks like the victim has a history.
At this point all we have is a theory.
Murder weapon was an 'evolver.
Evolutionary, my dear!
Well, it didn't happen overnight.
I think we write it up as natural causes.
According to a local pastor, the murders took place over a course of seven days.
Well, he had a good run.
In this town, sometimes even the fittest don't survive.
Hm, I believe the murderer used an evolver.
Took too long to cross the road, I'd say.
Ignore the red herring down at the end
I'm afraid this isn't the end of it.
Whoever did this really took his time.
Clearly what we have here is an evolving crime scene.
Nothing definite, but I have a theory.
Whoever did this obviously took their time.
Has the medical examiner established the era of death?
No suspects yet, but we're working on a theory...
Frankly, “Crime of the Century” would be an understatement.
This has Darwin's fingerprints all over it.
Right now all we have is a theory
This is the coldest case I've ever seen.
Let's show the forensic evidence to the Vice President.
We estimate the crime took place sometime between midnight and 500 million years ago.
Evolutionary, Watson. Evolutionary.
Evolutionary Officer Watson, evolutionary.
We're gonna have a problem with the statute of limitations on this one.
Longest killing spree ever.
Witnesses report hearing a big bang.
We think all the victims are related.
So sad. To make it this far then get hit by a truck
Find out if the victims are related.
Let's just say the case is evolving.
We’re missing something.
It looks like the Arkansas Board of Education has struck again.
This case keeps evolving.
Round up the usual evangelicals.
My theory keeps evolving.
Looks like he's running away from his past.
The victims appear to be related somehow.
Approximate time of death: 65 million years ago to yesterday at 7am
Check our records going back half a million years.
No suspects yet, but the case is clearly evolving.
I just feel like they’re all related somehow.
What kind of God would let this happen?
Unfortunately, his past caught up to him.
The killer's M.O. is clearly evolving
Call Forensics...and an anthropologist.
The case seems to be evolving quickly.
I think the case is still evolving. ...
Looks like the murders took place sometime between the hour of midnight and two million years ago.
Looks like Texas may have to revise their school textbooks again.
This may be the crime of the centuries.
What a shame. Looks like he just started standing on his own two feet.
We got a time line here?
This, my dear, is a crime as old as life itself.
This crime scene is evolving rapidly.
It's a rapidly evolving crime scene
Our case appears to be evolving.
I heard the mob often goes after relatives, but this is ridiculous!
I've got Darwin working on it. He has this theory....
We’re seeing a pattern evolving.
Well, it seems this case has evolved.
So, a fish, three primates, and a a guy named Joe walk into a bar. Stop me if you've heard this one before.
The real question is...how are these deaths linked?
No skid marks or sign of braking. Round up the usual evangelicals.
This guy took his time.
It's an evolving mystery.
It's not so difficult as you may think. The first few are early life forms, no surprises there. But this last one is almost human. Still, 2 dimensional with no apparent spine, so when you reason it out, it must be Paul Ryan."
Any idea exactly when this happened?
Have all his next of kin been notified?
The cause of death appears to be natural selection.
The witness said he just went ape.
I have a theory.
This was no accident: this was natural selection.
You've done a good job tracing his past.
The Creationists are going to say we planted this.
Time of death was between approximately 510,000,000 B.C. and 10 PM yesterday.
Our forensics expert says it was done with chalk by a seven-year old.
At this point, it's definitely more than a theory.
OK, OK. But I still don’t believe in climate change.
It seemed a little fishy at first
Reports suggest that it all started with a big bang.
I need fingerprints, paw prints, and while you’re at it, fossil records.
I presume the next step up will be a woman.
I haven’t seen a case like this in eons.
Looks like only that last one stood up for himself.
The victim died between 24 hours ago and the Mesozoic.
Let’s just say our investigation is still evolving
Yes, but the crime of which century?
Well, there’s no telling how this case will evolve.
All we know about the victim is that he wasn't the fittest.
Be sure to make note of the fact that we have an evolving crime scene.
What we're dealing with here is a classic case of natural selection.
See if the victim had a fossil record.
Let’s put a tail on him.
Time of death: post-Cambrian.
So we’ve established that the killer likes to take his time...
How long ago did you say we got the call?
Neighbors are saying they heard a 'big bang.'
And he had come so far.
Canvass the neighborhood, and see if anyone heard a big bang.
Something fishy about this case right from the beginning!
Evolutionary, dear Watson ...
Might be hard finding next of kin.
Get Darwin on the phone.
Classic Cookie Cutter Killer.
Tell the Deputy they were killed in mostly cold blood.
It's a tough one; we're missing a link or two.
We can rule out Evangelicals.
I'm compelled to ignore this evidence on religious grounds.
It looks like his past has finally caught up with him.
Well we can rule out a creationist.
It looks like last man standing, with no tail to tell.
Tell the commissioner that my theory on this murder is still evolving.
Confirming time of death is going to be tough with this one.
Round up all the usual Creationists.
Not even the fittest survived
At least we know the killer isn't a creationist.
The witness said he heard a big bang.
Now, there’s got to be something that links the victims ...
I'm starting to think the victims were related.
There's something fishy about the way this all started.
If that fish had been "armed" this tragedy might never had happened.
It's just a theory.
Well, the good news is he won't strike again for a million years or so.
Looks like the killer spent 500 million years planning this.
From the looks of it, the body has been here a while.
Round up all the usual atheists
It appears that either the victim had four pets with him or he died very slowly.
I just keep thinking we're missing a link in this case
Get me a record of all their contacts between the Early Devonian and the Late Pleistocene.
Well, you may see undeniable evidence of purposeful design, officer. But I see the random outcome of chance, happenstance, and fortuitous circumstance preserved by natural selection.
I want the amoeba brought in for questioning
Kind of hard to pin down the exact time of death on this one.
I wonder who will be next.
Looks like even the fittest didn't survive.
It looks like they were all related.
The victim, eventually, was a stand-up kinda guy.
I'm doubting it was an act of God.
So much for Survival of the Fittest.
It's our oldest cold case.
Ok officer, start from 'The beginning'...
This didn't happen overnight, I reckon.
The killer really took his time with this one.
3.8 to 2.5 billion years, but we may be able to narrow it down after the coroner’s report.
Our theory about the identity of the victim is still evolving.
It took us 3.8 billion years, but I think we finally got our man.
Well, at least we know where he came from.
Clearly the evidence in this case is still evolving.
Whaddaya think, cold-blooded killer? Or warm-blooded?
I think there's still a missing link.
The coroner puts the time of death somewhere between 4 o'clock this morning and 250 million years ago.
We should have nabbed this guy ages ago.
Apparently, Betsy DeVos has an alibi.
Are you saying the victims were related?
Is there any evidence connecting the victims?
It’s a puzzler, officer. I just can’t seem to find the missing link.
Man, talk about premeditation.
Neighbor said he heard a big bang
It looks like his past finally caught up with him.
I guess this kills my survival of the fittest theory.
Time of death? I’d say somewhere between two hours and two million years ago.
There must be a missing link in all of this.
Even the fittest didn't survive this one.
Even the fittest can’t survive in this town.
But where do we go from here?
We have a lot of next of kin notifying ahead of us.
According to the President, this never happened.
We have five victims, ranging in age from 52 to 3.8 billion years old.
Do we know the time of extinction?
Time of death is some time between the Cretaceous and 4am
Random? No, I believe this is the work of an intelligent design.
Looks like the work of the Kansas Board of Education.
Evolutionary, Sgt. Watson.
One thing's for sure, it was premeditated.
They won't believe this back in Tennessee.
The killer's methods appear to be evolving.
Notifying the next of kin will be a real challenge.
Time of death is between 4am and 85 million years.
Apparently, the details of the crime are still evolving.
What we have here is a serial killer who is compelled to act every 50 to 100 million years.
Well, we know it didn't happen overnight.
So not only does he kill the guy, he kills his pet monkey, his smaller pet monkey, his dog, and his fish.
Evolutionary, my dear Ms. Watson, evolutionary.
We know one thing, the perp selected his victims naturally.
I'm thinking that these deaths did not all happen at the same time.
So far it's just a theory.
I think we'd better check the statute of limitations on this one.
Like the chief always says, “Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.”
Looks like he couldn't escape his past.
I told you the case was still evolving.
Offhand, I’d say the grudges go way back.
We'll never solve this in a million years.
I understand, but here in Kansas it is against the law.
I don't like where this is leading.
It’s just a hunch, but I’d look for a Creationist.
Call in Darwin. Maybe he has a theory.
Obviously, this case is evolving.
Tell the press that the case is evolving.
We're working with the hypothesis that the victims are all related somehow, but its an evolving theory.
4.5 billion years of this and it doesn't get any easier.
Looks like the crime occurred sometime between the late Triassic Period and 11:30 pm last night.
I'd say the killer has a long history.
Coroner puts time of death anywhere from 3am to 20-million years ago.
Evolutionary, Officer Watson.
Check Betsy DeVos's alibi.
Bring in the Kansas State Board of Education for questioning.
Ok. I think we should start at the beginning.
We're going to need a complete history on the victim, going back as far as you can.
We think it all started with the little guy on the end.
One thing we know, whoever did this obviously took their time.
It looks like natural causes.
It's an evolving crime scene
This is one of our really cold cases.
They were last seen alive on the rear window of a minivan.
This case keeps evolving.
Looks to me like the work of a counter-evolutionary.
Officer Darwin, this is Texas. You’ll never get twelve jurors to agree with your theory.
We’re not expecting the next victim to turn up for a few million years.
Round up the usual anthropologists.
This case is evolving before our very eyes.
The first 48 million years are critical if we’re going to solve this thing.
The situation continues to evolve.
Geez, just when you get to walk erect...
I knew something was fishy from the start.
In the big city you adapt, or you die.
"It appears this always was a bad intersection".
It's our longest-running cold case.
Looks like we have a rapidly evolving crime scene here
Bring in Darwin for questioning.
I think I know what happened, but it's just a theory.
Just a hunch, but they could be related.
My instincts tell me there's a missing link to this crime.
It’s a mass murder of prehistoric proportions.
You don't often come across a killer with that kind of patience.
When these guys go after your family, they really mean it.
Any theories?
I think this crime goes back much further than we ever imagined.
Too soon to tell Sargent, we'll have to see how this evolves.
We're not talking murder here, we're talking extinction.
I thought evolution was only a crime in the "Bible Belt."
According to Gallup, 38% of the people aren’t going to believe this.
We’re having difficulty reaching the next of kin.
We have all the evidence, but there seems to be a missing link.
Takes me back to a case I solved at the old La Brea tar pit.
Did you notice there is a missing link?
This looks like Darwin's work.
Our theory of the case is evolving.
I'm telling you, sergeant, there's a missing link.
What in creation happened here?
Yeah, the scientists said it was only a matter of time....
Who's next is beyond me.
Looks like a crime for the ages
We have the DNA test results. It appears they're all related.
The neighbors reported a big bang.
So what happened to the tail?
I have a theory... but it's only a theory.
We're going to need more than a theory.
I will need a list of all their relatives
Some days this job really puts life in perspective
I'm afraid the statute of limitations ran out on the first four eons ago.
Round up the usual suspects by family, species, Genus, and phylum.
It's the oldest story in the book.
Perhaps it's time to address our slow response to homicide scenes.
Get me Ancestry.com
Get right on it. Contacting next of kin could take a million years.
We suspect Intelligent Design.
They're linked, but I'm missing something.
No information yet. The case is still evolving.
See if you can find Flintstone; he might know something.
I wish we knew where this case was going.
Keep that cordon up; this is an evolving crime scene.
There's a missing link somewhere...
We better act fast - the killer's evolving.
Well, at least we know where he came from.
Didn’t I tell you to put a tail on him?
Definitely the work of our guy. Same place, same M.O. Every 28 million years, just like clockwork.
We suspect that death occurred somewhere between 5 million years ago, and earlier this afternoon.
...and all apparently related.
It looks like the victims were naturally selected.
I see what you meant when you said this was a really cold case.
All we need to solve this case is the Missing Link.
We’re looking for someone with a lot of priors.
Professional hit, it's gotta be the Fundamentalists.
Sure, it might be a temporal anomaly, but then again it might just have been bad luck for a guy with some weird pets.
We think it's natural causes.
Officer, it’s clear that this case is evolving.
That escalated quickly.
Shame to lose your extended family like that.
Talk about a guy's past coming back to haunt him.
No conclusions yet. The evidence is still evolving.
The evidence says that victims are related, but it's still just a theory.
Apparently they were shot with an evolver
There's a missing link in this case.
Really makes ya think--'what are we becoming?'
Do you suppose there is any relationship between the victims?
This may take some digging.
This was a professional hit. Even the fittest didn't survive.
My guess? Natural causes.
Intelligent design, my ass.
Well, officer, I have a theory...
Any other theories?
I guess the fittest don't always survive.
Looks like he used an evolver.
First, they heard a big bang.
Well, it's obvious he's wasn't the fittest.
We may have waited a bit too long to move the body.
I thinks it’s pretty clear detective - the next victim will be a woman.
Sick bastard got whole family tree.
We can conclude that the perpetrator is not an evangelical Christian.
Apparently someone reported hearing a Big Bang.
If we don't solve this case in the next 48 million years, we never will.
I've determined that the victims were not randomly selected.
This will be an interesting lineup.
Bring Darwin in for questioning.
Looks like a case of arrested development.
How do we know they're related?
Were any of the victims related?
The coroner says they were all related.
It looks like somebody drew their own conclusion!
It all happened so fast.
We live in a Republican State. You tell me how we're going to explain this in court.
Clearly, this was a crime of epoch proportions.
I agree inspector. It looks like his past finally caught up with him.
We've got a few leads, but the evidence is still evolving.
My theory is that these victims were related.
I'm still not convinced.
I think we can rule out intelligent design.
Can we at least agree the victims were related?
Call it a hunch, but my gut tells me that whoever is behind this has been planning it for a long time.
This case is evolving as we speak
Well, let's round up the usual creationists.
The facts in this case seem to be slowly evolving.
It's a long story.
The boys at Fish and Game got the call first, but they called in homicide when the case evolved.
I'm not looking forward to another monkey trial.
Maybe we should bring in the asteroid for questioning again.
time of death is going to be tricky
It’s his past catching up with him.
Well, the evidence is clear... I’m just not sure they’ll believe it.
The witnesses say it all started with a big bang.
There's a missing link here and I'm gonna find it.
Darwin if we do. Darwin if we don't.
It was made to look like natural selection.
Interesting theory, but the evidence seems sketchy.
Tell Dougie to turn over his chalk. I'm putting his smart ass on administrative leave.
Our case is still evolving.
Damn it, Carol. No matter how this case evolves, he's always three species ahead of us.
This stuff really tests my faith.
You do have wonder who's next.
I think these crimes may be related.
Very suspicious -- everyone knows that evolution goes from left to right.
It seems the facts of the case are evolving
The coroner placed the time of death somewhere between 400 million years ago and 4 hours.
I'd say that puts the time of death around 5-8 million years ago.
I just don't see a connection
Based on what I see here, it's unlikely we will find a sixth victim.
I don't know? I'm missing a link here somewhere
We can rule out the “creationists “ as suspects in the case.
This grudge goes way back.
Yup. Shot by an evolver.
Get me Inspector Darwin.
There's evidence that he was on the run from his past.
Round up the primordial suspects.
What in creation do you think happened?
My god, the animal cracker killer has struck again!
His name was John Dough. He was from a long line of cookie cutters.
Just the facts, ma'am. No theories.
It looks like the killer took his time.
A good case---the evidence is evolving.
Detective Darwin, do you have a theory on this?
It's Kansas, kid. This never happened.
These victims appear to have been naturally selected.
It's a theory, Sargeant. But we need facts.
I don't like the way this case is evolving
Time of death? Between 12 hours and 3.7 billion years... more or less.
Any theories, detective?
I'll bet it's just ad for Ancestory.com
Looking back, he should have seen this coming!
Well, this case is evolving.
The case would be closed if we could just find that missing link.
Lets question the Creationists first.
We think the crime took place over a period of time.
Looks like they were tailing him for a long time.
Yes, it would appear that the killer selected his victims naturally.
So, which one did you say reminds you of your husband?
It really is a shame--he had come so far.
Time of death?
The witness said he heard a big bang.
An evolving crime scene
'At least we know how he got here.'
Round up the usual species.
Better get the tracking dogs. There still may be ascent of man...
I suggest we put these on the back window of every SUV in the country and see if that produces any leads.
It appears that his past finally did catch up to him.
We do know that the victims were distantly related.
Evolutionary Officer Watson, evolutionary.
As a Creationist, I find these victims to be completely unrelated.
Yeah our chalk guy is on some shit
Put a tail on that one.
No leads yet, but I've got a theory.
Don’t be fooled. It’s a Banksy.
Well, it seems pretty clear to me that his next victim is going to be A.I.
Yes, but it’s still just a theory.
Well, I think it's more than a theory at this point
There’s a missing a link here.
Looks like the little guy started it.
They preserved the evidence but there’s still no proof.
This may look like an easy case, but I think there's a missing link.
Round up the creationists.
The religious right doesn't want this to get out.
I think the fish is a red herring
I have a theory on this...
Sergeant, it appears that this case is evolving.
Al was an upright guy but he ran with some real lowlifes.
This means it’s not just a theory anymore.
Get Darwin. See what his theory is.
The answer is evolutionary my dear Watson.
At this point Sir, the only thing we know is the victim was not a creationist
It's my firm belief these deaths are related.
Don't be silly. The victims obviously have no connection to each other.
So far all we have is a theory.
Looks like each victim was somehow related.
We’ve got to move fast, Sir, the case appears to be evolving quickly!
We have to stop this before it evolves into something more serious.
We think they're related but there's a missing link somewhere
It's evolutionary officer Watson.
If I could just find the missing link.
His choice of victims was a natural selection.
Officer Darwin, does this selection seem natural to you?
Let's start with the creationists.
This is why we don't hire chalk outliners from The New Yorker.
There's a missing link.
Round up the usual suspects - scientists, atheists, and other freethinkers.
Hmm, better check the statute of limitations on this one.
They were selected, all right. But it sure wasn't natural.
Obviously, an evolutionary dead end.
If only we could find the missing link.
This looks like an evolving crime scene.
Those evangelicals weren't kidding when they declared war on evolution.
VERY FUNNY !! Now where’s the Cold Case comedian ?
We're close to solving the crime, but I keep feeling there's a missing link.
We've got a 95% DNA match.
The evidence is still evolving but we're sure the victims were all related.
Round up the creationists in the neighborhood.
Darwin’s fingerprints are all over this.
The killer is selective, naturally.
Right now, it's just a theory.
At this point it's just a theory.
Right now, it's just a theory.
Tell the press it’s an evolving story.
Whoever did this has clearly been planning it for billions of years.
It's got that Darwin guy's fingerprints all over it.
The victims were chosen by natural selection
We have to find the missing link.
And get O'Grady to concentrate on finding that missing link.
They were killed in cold blood... except this last one.
It's a crime of genus-cide.
Well, this case is evolving quickly.
We've narrowed down the time of death to sometime between the late Cambrian and early Pleistocene periods.
Apparently, that's as far as they got.
Looks like we have a serial Darwinist on our hands.
And we’re sure there’s nothing linking them?
This is a crime for the ages
Well sir, it’s a really long story...
The evidence may stand up in court—but it’ll never make it past the Louisiana school board.
I'm afraid the next victim is going to be a woman.
This was no random crime. Naturally, selection played a role.
We have a match on the gun. It’s a .32 evolver.
So, we are looking for a serial killer who is approximately four hundred million years old.
It's either Banksy or Darwin. Bring them both in for questioning.
'Evolutionary, dear Watson. Evolutionary.'
I can't help but feel there is a missing link.
When you round up suspects, rule out Creationists.
We need to act fast, his MO is evolving.
looks like the work of a serial creationist
This killer’s pattern is starting to evolve.
We're going to need more chalk if this case keeps evolving.
It's just a theory.
There are conflicting theories concerning the relationship of the victims.
It seems all my favorite childhood snacks committed this crime.
Got any theories?
Something's not adding up. There's a missing link.
I guess evolution is dead. Now what?
He had 185 million priors.
Yeah I get it, but where is the missing link?
Time of death was somewhere between 10:15 and 3 million BC.
Truly a crime for the ages.
Tell the press that it’s still an evolving case.
There is overwhelming evidence, but it’s still just a theory.
Hmm. More victims of the Paleo Diet.
We can rule out your evangelical husband.
Put out an APB for the missing link.
Just say” The investigation is evolving “
Our only witness was a nun, but she claims she didn't see anything.
The evidence suggests that this case is still evolving.
The victims appear to have been selected naturally.
Looks like he was probably lying there for a while
It's the crime of the centuries.
He went about as far as he could go.
This case has been evolving right from the start.
talk about a slow death
It's just my gut instinct, let's not call it a theory yet.
At least we can rule out the Mormons.
Kind of reminds me of the back window on my wife's SUV.
I see you are still working the cold cases.
This case is evolving right before our eyes..
So much for survival of the fittest, eh Morgan?!
Word on the street say's he was a stand up guy.
One thing is clear, the killer lacked an intelligent design.
Darwin’s fingerprints are all over this.
Drain the swamp seemed like a good idea at the time
This case is finally starting to get some legs
Well, we can rule out Adam as a suspect.
I have a hunch the victims were related.
Mark that time of death approximate.
...and tell Detective Murphy to quit playing with the police chalk!
There was nothing natural in the selection of these victims.
So sad. Just when he was starting to make something of himself.
APPARENTLY, HE JUST COULDN'T ADAPT TO LIFE IN THE BIG CITY.
I'd say the motive's definitely evolving.
Clues on the case are still evolving.
Find out if anyone heard a big bang.
I'd put time of death anywhere between midnight Friday and the Cretaceous Period.
I don’t know exactly what happened but I have a theory...
Round up the usual theories.
Any way to bury this and pretend it never happened?
Let's hope it all ends here.
This is going to be a hard one if we get a creationist jury.
Maybe we shouldn't stand here...
I could be wrong; however, I think there is a missing link !
This is leading somewhere.
Hmmm...this case is evolving before our eyes.
I think he was shot with an evolver.
This appears to be a constantly evolving case.
First thing we need to do is establish a timeline.
Let’s just wait and see how this case evolves.
We’ve reason to believe the deceased may be related.
Sir, we've run into a bit of trouble locating the next of kin.
It appears this case is still evolving.
What has me baffled is that they all proved to have a very similar DNA.
I bet the DNA-Analysts will have fun on this case.
The fish started it.
Find the missing link and you’ll find your killer.
Well Carruthers, looks like even the fittest didn't survive this one.
You might say that my theory is evolving.
He had a long history of trouble.
How long has this case been open?
I think we're looking for a serial creationist.
The coroner's leaning towards natural causes.
Sorry it took me 570 million years to get here, I took Lincoln Tunnel.
Well, I've got a theory.
Ok, so we know that the perp is not a creationist
Looks like they got the whole family.
Now its a homo-cide
We're looking at the evolution of a serial killer
It was a really slow vehicle!
This wasn't random. The victims were selected naturally.
This is a tough case. We need to find the missing link!
Technically this was written up as an Extinction, which is really going to screw with the guys down at homicide.
Estimated time of death? I’d say Paleozoic, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tuesday around 18:00 hours.
I'm not sure. Let's see how the case evolves.
I got a hunch this case goes way back
I’ve never seen a crime evolve so quickly.
This was probably not an act of God.
Someone wanted to make this look natural.
The witness said it all started with a Big Bang.
I say we start with the fish.
My hunch is that each victim was selected naturally.
We're pretty sure the killer spent a long time planning this....
I would love to say, "It's evolutionary Watson" but your name isn't Watson is it?
Finally the case is starting to evolve.
I think we’re looking for a very,very slow moving vehicle
You can see how the crime scene evolved.
Looks like a crime against nature
Of course, it’s just a theory...
Looks like the end of the line
It's an evolving case.
All we need to do, now, is find the missing link.
I'd say that we've taken way too long to investigate this crime.
Search the area for an evolver.
This is some highly evolved monkey business.
A lot of history behind this one....
I place Time of Death between now and ten million years ago.
He's selecting his victims naturally.
There were no eyewitnesses, sir, but someone did say they heard a Big Bang.
Those damn atheists are always trying to make a point.
Something tells me there's a missing link in this case.
Get me Detective Darwin
Looks like the victims were somehow related.
See if Forensics can establish a timeline-
For now, it's just a theory.
Get Detective Charlie Darwin on this, pronto.
Tell me again what direction it goes in.
Well Henry, it looks like the case is evolving.
DNA shows all these victims were related.
We’re missing some kind of link.....
I have a theory but it could take some time.
Carbon dating puts the time of death at 1.7 to 1.9 million years ago.
It took a while, but we've been able to narrow down era of death.
No my dear Watson. I said "evolutionary".
Time is relative and chalk is cheap.
It was a Christian fundamentalist. He buried the evidence.
On the report, make sure it says we didn't fire until after he was armed.
I don't believe it.
Looks like he died a really slow death.
One thing's for sure: Our suspect is a cold-blooded and warm-blooded murderer.
I have the same stickers on my car.
It might take another 2-3 million years, but oh yeah, he'll kill again.
His past caught up with him.
I guess even the fittest don't always survive.
...Actually, half of the victims were cold blooded as well.
Lieutenant, my hunch has now evolved into a theory.
Do you have a theory of the case?" "It's evolving.
Time of Death any time between 4pm Tuesday and the Cambrian period.
It’s an evolving story.
It appears the case is evolving
Yeah, this looks like Darwin’s M.O.
So where did the fish come from? That’s the key to solving this case.
I feel like we're missing a link
Looks like he was killed by a high caliber evolver
This ain't over.
Contact the really, really cold case unit.
I think the statute of limitations has expired in this case.
Round up the usual sub-species.
Find out where Mike Pence was last night.
His past finally caught up with him
Check to see if there are any witnesses who heard a big bang.
Sad. The victim was making such progress.
Looks to me like this one goes way back.
Looks to me like this crime may still be evolving...
It's going to take forever to solve this one.
Well, it appears it is no longer just a theory.
Something is missing
Hard to tell... this case keeps evolving.
...the oldest stall tactic - keep getting the hearing pushed back.
Well anyway, it's just a theory.
See if any of them have fossil records.
I'd say the crime scene is still evolving.
Looks like the killer has been selecting their victims naturally.
It appears they were selected naturally.
Hit & run? Nah, they were just slow-crossers, WAY too slow. Half-a-billion years too slow.
This was no accident, it is intelligent design.
Such a waste. He had finally gotten back on his own two feet.
The case is evolving, but I think we're looking for a stand up guy.
I have a theory, but it will be hard to prove.
Homeschooling prevents me from understanding this case.
Cunning, but inefficient. He only needed to kill the fish.
Whoever did this took his time in planning it.
I think I see a pattern here…
This could take ages.
The investigation's still evolving, Sir ...
Did you put a tail on the suspect?
A leprechaun, crispy critters, dino-bites...it's evolved into a cereal killing.
Evolutionary, my dear Watson, evolutionary . . . . .
Round up the Darwin gang.
This street hasn't been swept in ages.
Someone called in a tip: they heard a Big Bang and now we’ve got this.
They got the whole family
"I have a theory about this one".
His family stated- "He was like a fish out of water"
What kind of animal would do something like this?
We don't see much of this in Texas.
We think they've been planning this for some time.
I can't wait to see the surveillance videos.
Forensics says it'll take eons.
Where is the President in this sequence?
He died like a man
So how many DNA matches do we have?
Looks like the perpetrator took his time with this one.
the evidence would suggest the killer has opposable thumbs
Looks like they wiped out the whole family.
He seems to strike every three or four hundred million years or so.
The evidence suggests either Natural Selection or a Third Grader.
My great great great great grandfather was the first detective on this case.
That reminds me. I'm supposed to pick up my brother-in-law at five.
Well, I do have a Theory...
Evolutionary, Officer Watson.
I think the religious right did it.
I'm seeing a pattern, here.
Looks like our killer's MO is evolving.
This case is rapidly evolving.
Don’t jump to conclusions, Lieutenant. This case is evolving.
Check the victims' DNA in case they're linked.
We've tracked the perp from the aquarium, then to the zoo, I think his next move will be the beer concession stand at Yankee Stadium.
This case is going to take eons to solve.
Call Scopes. He'll know what happened here.
Wait, I know this guy, He's Homo Erectus
DNA tests suggest the victims were related.
Well, I'd say we have a fairly thorough background on the victim here.
I think we're missing a link there, officer.
Looks like the evidence is evolving.
Seems like I've been working this case forever.
Cripes, this one is going to take eons to solve.
This is bad news for the creationists
Such a tragedy. They were hit on their way to a family reunion.
Worst case I've seen in eons.
Or, it could have been a creationist.
This case is taking a long time to develop.
Which one is Lucy?
This can't have been an accident.
He had a history.
You'll never convince some people that this really happened.
Definitely an evolving case.
One witness reported hearing a big bang.
I know means, motive, and opportunity, but there's still a missing link
What we've got here is an evolving crime scene investigation.
The evidence is clearly evolving
It seems the killer's methods are evolving.
Textbook stuff. The evolution of a crime.
This has Darwin written all over it.
Get the paleontologist down here. Looks like premeditated extinction.
Tell the chief that the situation is evolving.
Nothing to report yet, the case is still evolving.
I just need to find the missing link...
It's an open-and-shut case... Another dead idiot, another Darwin Award
This case was fishy from the start but it's definitely evolving.
This case has evolved quickly.
Let's figure out the origins of this mess.
The poor guy was haunted by his past.
Out main suspect is Scott Pruitt.
They used an evolver.
Finding the next of kin will be difficult.
And get me alibis for every school board in the tri-state area.
It will be interesting to see how this case evolves.
Creationists. Call it a hunch.
With a case like this we're looking at 100,000 years to life.
Evolve all you want. You still have to learn how to cross a damn street!
Follow the monkey.
Can I tell you my theory?
At least it's clear how the fish died
Let's get Darwin on the case.
You're right - it's an evolving crime scene.
See if there’s any links between the victims.
It's evolutionary, my dear.
Well, it’s a theory.
My theory on this case is evolving
Just what we need in this investigation: a chalk man with a sick sense of humor.
Remember, it's only a theory.
I told you not to draw any conclusions.
It's obviously the work of an intelligent designer.
I see we have established the timeline.
We can see the killer took his time
I'm just saying, we should also consider the theory that those are not chalk outlines.
We don't know if it's him. No-one put a tail on the guy.
Whatever happened here, didn't evolve overnight.
What kind of animal would do this?
Well, I guess that's the end of the line.
Round up all the Creationists in the area.
We don't have much to go on, but the facts are evolving...
This is a tough one officer. The evidence keeps evolving.
So much for the fittest.
The killer obviously took his time with this one.
I think I see a pattern evolving
Well, it's just a theory.
It's an evolving situation.
I'm not sure...the crime scene is still evolving.
This crime looks like it was planned ages ago.
Are the victims related?
Like I said, it's just a theory.
The case continues to evolve
The facts are evolving as we speak, Inspector.
there was no eye witness but somebody heard a big bang
As you can see, this is a rapidly evolving case.
My theory of what happened here is evolving.
Clearly, he wasn't the fittest.
Well, it appears these victims were naturally selected...
I know I'm missing something
Well, the oldest cold case on Earth just got hot again.
I think we can rule out any fundamentalist Christians.
Just say this is a developing story.
The community is going to go ape when we prove these murders are linked.
The evidence is vestigial, at best.
It appears crime runs in this family.
They not only went after his family, but the whole family tree!
The details of this case are clearly evolving.
Whoever did this, I'll track him down if it takes 'til the beginning of time.
We theorize that the deceased were naturally selected.
His wife said he had it coming for some time
I wonder what comes next?
Forensics found an amoeba too, but we couldn't find chalk that small.
Time of death? Between one and four epochs is my guess.
Let’s find this ‘Banksy’ character and stop these dangerous ideas from being outlined on our streets.
I can't vouch for the first four victims, but I have a hunch the fifth was an upright citizen.
Definitely premeditated. Must’ve taken a billion years to plan this one.
Get Norwinsky on this. He's our best anthroprimorodentoherpetroichthyologist.
Our only witness claims they heard a big bang.
Have you notified the most recent common ancestor?
The White House believes they're unrelated.
We'll get the slime responsible for this.
Oh man!
witness said only the fittest survived
My hunch puts the time of death somewhere between yesterday and the Paleozoic.
So I get putting the ugly family out of their misery...but why kill their fish?
I'm still not convinced. It's just a theory, you know . . .
So far, our leading suspects are Natural Selection and A Failure to Adapt.
Well, we can rule out that the victim was homeschooled.
I don't know who's responsible, but I have a pretty good theory.
The case is still evolving, but we suspect the killer had opposable thumbs.
It appears to be a case of premeditated evolution.
While at first I thought it was open-and-shut, I would say my theory on this case is still evolving.
Might have been a very, very slow-acting poison.
There’s a missing a link here.
My God, they killed the whole phylum.
Are the victims related?
I understand the who, and the when, but what's the missing link?
This case is evolving by the minute
Evolutionary my dear Officer Watson.
How long did you say before they found the body?
Since Trump's in office...evolution is dead.
I'm going to find the animal who did this Sergeant or I'll be a monkey's uncle.
I guess we can rule out the Creationists.
Let's not jump to any conclusions while the crime scene's still evolving.
Yeah. Darwin said it looked like he was tailed almost to the end.
The real crime here is the sorry state of science education in this country.
This is the most graphic crime scene I've ever come across.
I think there is a missing link.
The crime shows no evidence of intelligent design.
Looks like the Creationists are getting serious.
I've seen this before, but never so fast.
Make a note so that we don’t miss any links.
Our theory of how it happened is still evolving.
The perp's getting smarter with every step he takes.
We have a creationist on the loose.
All that time, and nobody tried to help? New Yorkers!
Has the genus been informed?
You're right. But will it stand up in court?
Any clues on where they were going?
Well, one of them died a man.
This is evolving into quite the case.
The killer took his time with this one!
There's has to be a missing link somewhere
There have been developments.
And let me guess, no one here saw anything about how it started, am I right?
You're right. This case is evolving very quickly.
Want to speculate on the next victim?
It's hard to say how this case will evolve.
Not yet, but we have a pretty good theory.
Now we at least know where the victim came from.
Something like this doesn't just happen overnight.
Hmmph...I don't care what the Lab Boys say, this was an act of God
We're not in Kansas anymore.
The perp’s hostility for this guy goes way back.
So the first thing we have to do is figure out who died first...
It looks like the killer took his time.
Remind me, HOW long have we been working on this case?
Inform headquarters that the facts are still evolving.
My wife's family, I'd know 'em anywhere.
Looks like the case has evolved into a homocide
Just a hunch, but I think they may be related.
Some things they just don't teach you at the Academy.
I'm more worried about the one that survived.
The evolution of sidewalk chalk.
Cross-check NRA, Creationist, Pet Phobia, Hannity.
I'd select the usual suspects, naturally.
Tell the papers that the case is currently evolving.
I just can't shake the nagging feeling that something is missing.
Looks like time is on our side on this one
It's evolutionary, my dear.
.....Well, it's just one of my theories.
It's the work of an evil genus.
We're looking for a serial killer with too much time on their hands.
Word on the street is he goes by the name 'Darwin.'
The timeline here is critical.
This didn't happen in one night.
For age of victim write, "approximately two million years".
Ay, word on the streets is that the creationists are cleaning up the evidence...
We're not certain of the motive, but we have a theory that's rapidly evolving.
Looks like the crime of the centuries!
This is a Creationist crime of biblical proportions.
I'm noticing a pattern here.
Miocene or Pliocene ... it’s still a crime scene.
Looks like Charlie Darwin is back in town.
So, which one do you think died first?
I don't know, it looks like it's missing a link to me.
Multiple victims. No obvious connection. Let’s hope one of these is finally the missing link.
I haven't a clue who's next of kin.
Just write time of death somewhere between midnight and 530 million years ago.
Looks like this has been in the planning stages for quite awhile!
See if you can narrow Time of Death to something shorter then the Pleistocene Era.
We should have seen it coming.
This is definitely a cold case.
There's a missing link in this case.
I've seen this M.O. before. It goes way back.
This truly is a crime for the ages.
Put out an APB for the missing link.
There's a missing link in this case and we've got to find it.
Still can't shake your "God" hunch, can ya?
The solution will reveal itself as soon as we find the missing link
This looks like a simple case. We just have to find the missing link.
Walk me through the last billion years.
I think I am beginning to see how this crime evolved
The boys in forensics will have a field day with this one.
We might have to contact Ancestry.com on this one.
His troubles go way back.
Looks like we've got a DNA trail here.
Evolutionary, Watson.
This is what happens when you drain the swamp.
You call that a theory?
Truth is, they had it coming for a long time.
Damn, not again. Better get Hominidcide on the case.
The Church tried to cover up the evidence.
No, I don't think the fish did it.
I think they're related, but it's just a theory.
Round up the usual paleoanthropologists.
Ok, let's say it *was* the meteor... We still need to find motive.
There's still not enough evidence.
Tell the Chief the situation on the ground is evolving.
Carbon date 'em, Danno.
Find the missing link and you find our killer.
No Christian jury is going to buy any of this.
When did this happen?
It appears the victims were related.
Time of death might be hard to pin down, Chief.
Make sure Forensics checks his carbon footprint.
It's just a hunch really... But I think it might be the same one who assaulted global warming.
This case is evolving very quickly.
No, I said we're looking for a group of violent counter-evolutionaries, not a group of violent counter-revolutionaries.
I'd say the case...is evolving.
It doesn't add up. There must be a missing link.
Is there a link?
Another promising band cut down trying to cross Abbey Road.
The question is whether or not it was planned.
All I can say is that the investigation is evolving.
Just note that my theory on this murder is still evolving.
So far, we've only got a theory.
This case is tough. The clues keep evolving.
We should monitor this situation as it continues to evolve.
Hard to say - the case is still evolving.
Well, it had to end somewhere.
This looks like Darwin's work.
I don't know, but let's see what develops.
I don't know who the killer is, but I'm willing to bet he's the fittest.
“Yeah, the EPA thought it was him too, but he was at Mar A Lago when it happened.
I would take us billions of years to figure this one out.
We're looking for someone who just didn't like where this guy was coming from.
As you can see, the investigation is evolving.
We should have responded more quickly.
I don't care about your theories, officer. I need evidence!
We're seeing an uptick in science-hate crimes.
Evolutionary, Watson.
Didn’t see it evolving into this.
We're missing a link.
Well, the crime scene's still evolving, but to me it looks like it was a .44 Cro-Magnum.
Another evolutionary dead end
I have a hunch the victims are related somehow.
This has appeared fishy from the very start.
I can't help feeling we're missing a link here.
We’ll catch him. This crime shows no sign of intelligent design.
This looks like a really cold case.
I doubt any of them ever saw it coming
Looks like the victims were related.
Frankly, I expected something different when the captain sent me to review an evolving case.
I can see how the evidence has evolved.
Looks like we may have a creationist on our hands.
These were not the fittest.
Well, that kills my theory.
Interesting thoughts, but at this point, it's only a theory.
As you can see, it was a very slow death.
Get me a list of all fundamentalist Christians in the vicinity.
We'll have to wait for the DNA tests.
'What concerns me most is that his pattern seems to be evolving...'
No new leads, but the case is still evolving.
It's just a theory but I think they're related.
It's one for the ages.
Only time will tell.
Well officer, my theory is evolving
There’s really no way to tell who his next victim will be. They’re just naturally selected.
Well, I think we can rule out extinction.
So, the Darwin Awards really are a thing?
Boy, someone knows how to really hold a grudge.
No, for politicians it evolves left to right.
I heard they arrested a couple wearing fig leafs.
Not even the fittest survived
Season one: CSI Galapagos
I can't help but feel there's some kind of missing link.
Seems the victims were selected naturally.
Evolution in the first degree.
All we need is the missing link.
We have to find the missing link.
WOW! How long was he laying here before someone noticed and called this in?
I see primate facie evidence of a crime
DNA's gonna be tricky on this one.
The witness stated the scene evolved after he heard a big bang.
Let's not tell the press yet. We may have an evolution on our hands!
This reminds me of when I worked on the Scopes Trial.
Looks like another crime against humanity.
I can’t wait to get my hands on this Neanderthal!
This was a crime a long time in the making.
The killer took his time.
Whoever the killer is, he's been nursing a grudge for a very long time.
The coroner estimates the time of death was between midnight and 510 million years ago.
Let's grab a coffee. It'll take another hundred million years for any new evidence to turn up.
I can see this case is evolving.
It's too bad -- he was a real stand-up guy.
The killer's pattern is evolving.
Looks like we got us a sequential killer on our hands.
Well Margaret, sometimes the fittest don't always survive.
Tell them the case is still evolving.
This may be the work of a surreal killer.
Same M.O. as last time. There's got to be a missing link.
I'm not buying it. Where's the evidence?
Shame. First God, now Darwin.
We believe the body has been here for quite awhile.
I told the sketch artist I want everything from the beginning to the end. He may have taken me too literally.
I know who did it, but I can't get a warrant until we find the missing link.
So waddaya figure for the time of death?
His ID says John Scopes.
Looks like we have an evolving situation, Sargent.
The crime really seemed to evolve... eh?
Before the last election, I was pretty sure which direction to read this.
And if he hadn't run out of chalk?
He chooses his victims by natural selection.
See if Darwin has an alibi.
Seen it a million times. It starts out cute and innocent, but then evolves into something much more sinister.
The killer appears to have been in no rush.
I think that we can rule out a creationist.
"Forget the fish, our prints only go back 10 million years".
The evidence appears to still be evolving.
OK, Officer Darwin, let's hear your theory.
Book him for fishing without a license, 3 counts of hunting without a license and murder.
I estimate the time of death to be somewhere in the past 200 to 500 million years.
Those punk-ass chalk vandals are just messing with us now.
Can't be a solo job. This spans 500 million years.
Round up the usual Creationist suspects.
Looks like we have an evolving situation.
I don't care what they say down at the lab, it's not natural.
Let's start by checking the sticker on the rear window of his SUV.
Evidence definitely suggests our victim was being followed
Now, it's just a theory.....
Detective, I think this is just a Banksy.
We have a Darwinist on our hands.
We can rule out young-earth creationists.
This case is evolving before our eyes.
'This is our oldest cold case on file officer."
Looks like the latest victim was an upstanding citizen.
We are dealing with a series of random occurrences or an all powerful being with a peculiar sense of humor.
Should I write murder-suicide or natural selection?
This may take a while.
One last step for mankind.
The facts of this case are still evolving.
And to think the murderer killed this poor guy's pets, too.
We're one missing link away from cracking this case.
It will be hard to determine time of death.
One thing appears obvious. This killer had patience.
Shame they’ll never get to see how it all ends.
Oh. The humanity!
I'm thinking death was not instantaneous.
I thought I had it, but there’s a link missing...
This is a very cold case.
Their IDs say they’re related, but I don’t buy it.
His past caught up with him.
My theory is natural causes.
Looks like this case is evolving before our very eyes.
Ok, detective. You'd better start from the beginning.
I can't believe the way crime has evolved in this city.
Well, Officer Darwin, it looks like this murder investigation is evolving nicely.
The only clues we have are a half-eaten apple and a sarcastic serpent.
Well, we can rule God out.
It looks like the situation is rapidly evolving.
I've got two theories for the cause of death, but you're not going to believe one of them.
I wouldn’t have suspected this in half a billion years.
Were there any survivors?
At this point, all we've got is a theory.
Still no leads on the timeline or motive.
Chief says it’s an evolving case.
I think we can rule out natural causes.
I think it is pretty clear this crime happened over six days
They've been a crime family for generations.
This was a godless act.
You say that the crime happened over a six day period, and the perp took a break on Sunday?
This wasn't a quick death.
We're missing something here.
I have a theory, but there’s a missing link.
This case has a link that I'm missing.
There has to be a missing link.
This may be the crime of the ages.
This is a crime of historic dimensions.
They did their best but the victim was pronounced extinct at the Pleistocene.
It doesn't matter how strong the evidence is. Some people will always say it was an act of God.
I think these might be related.
We're looking for the fittest.
He had so much potential.
That Natural Selection can be a killer.
I think this case is really starting to evolve.
Round up the creationists.
This looks like the work of a serial creationist.
I simply can't see how these murders are connected - we're missing a link.
My gut says we'll soon be looking for another victim, only alot smarter than us.
Adapt or die, eh?
Right now, our primary suspect is time.
Clearly, the situation is evolving.
Wiped out an entire Family...or is that Genus?
We're still looking for the missing link.
This investigation is still evolving.
Looks like the killer isn't a Republican
This has Darwin's handwriting all over it.
You think this will happen again?
Round up all known members of the Creationist Gang for questioning.
Put a tail on him!
If only we'd gotten here later.
All we know is the killer took his time.
I believe all the victims were related.
The crime scene is evolving as we speak.
The killer took his time.
Looks like Natural Selection has struck again!
This serial killer is obviously evolving.
Well, at least we can take the creationist off the list of suspects.
I think this may have transcended our jurisdiction.
There's gotta be a missing link.
I want you to draw a banana peel under this ones foot and submit it to The New Yorker.
It's going to be tough to dust for prints.
This crime scene is evolving right before our eyes.
But like I said, it's just a Theory...
Well Betty, I think our case is slowly evolving.
I see this case is evolving.
The one thing we know for sure is that the killer wasn’t an Evangelical.
It proves the killers were very, very patient.
This certainly is evolving into an interesting case.
he was crossing very slowly .
Looks like we have a serial killer with a grudge against the entire evolutionary line.
He was acting fishy, so we put a tail on him, which he eventually lost, and now this.
This crime has obviously been in the planning stages for years.
He seems to have just stood up and walked away.
Better call in paleoforensics.
Let's hope it doesn't go any further than this.
The coroner says we can’t rule out intelligent design
If this case continues to evolve, we may need more chalk.
It was a very slow-acting poison.
We'll wait and see how this one evolves.
I planned on retiring 400 million years ago, but I gotta catch this guy.
It looks like another job by Darwin's gang
It's a serial killer all right. And I'm worried about the next victim.
I estimate the time of death to be somewhere between 530 million years and one hour ago.
Despite the preponderance of evidence to support our case, we'll need to concoct a story of biblical proportions to tell the captain.
Got any fancy theories to explain this one, Det. Darwin?
Let's start with the creationists.
"His choice of victims seems to be evolving".
Do we call Homicide or the ASPCA?
We think it might be linked to that dead amoeba we found in the East River."
This is going to be a controversial case.
We're missing a link.
Still looks fishy to me
Hmmm...seems to be a missing link.
This case will be one for the ages
Looks like Evolution's work. I don't have solid proof, but it's the best theory I've got.
I can see this took time.
Something tells me this wasn't an accident.
Whoever pulled this off was genus.
Apparently, they were witnesses testifying at that Scopes trial.
All killed by the same evolver.
Clearly, this case is still evolving.
Whoever did this is extremely patient.
Any DNA evidence?
Trust me, I know a real Banksy when I see one.
The case seems to be evolving quickly.
Don’t be stupid, this is clearly a random series of events.
Not sure, but we think they fell off a minivan.
Detective: "Well, officer, I believe I have a theory evolving..."
My family have been tracking this guy forever.
I think we're making progress.
There's a missing link.
Well, sergeant, this is quickly evolving into the strangest case I've ever seen.
Got any theories?
It’s the Creationist. I’d know his M. O. anywhere.
Put out an APB: we're looking for a common ancestor.
He was a hero - he stood up for us.
Well, it's taken a while, but I think we've finally got our man.
This case is evolving slowly.
Well Sergeant, one thing we do know, he wasn't a product of intelligent design.
Seemed like a simple case of cold-blooded murder, sergeant. But now it's evolved.
Obviously, this crime has been in the works for some time.
Stay alert, this case is constantly evolving.
It seems the killer's methods are evolving.
It's interesting how this case has evolved.
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I've got a theory.
The school board requires that I consider God a suspect
Check the primordial ooze for prints.
Round up the usual paleontologists.
Follow the tail.
Looks like we're missing a link here.
This could take literally forever.
You know what this means. Overtime!
Of course, the priest denies it all happened.
I have a theory, but I haven't been able to link it all together yet.
Faith alone can't solve this case
I have a theory about what happened but I’m afraid it may take years to prove it.
The case is clearly still evolving.
Looks like they got run over by a flat earther.
All the killer left behind was a Fig Leaf, an Apple and a Serpent
There's gotta be a missing link.
What can you say Alice? That’s life.
God knows who did it.
Somewhere in the last seventeen million years...there have to be witnesses.
There's very little evidence, but at least we aren't in Texas.
There's something fishy about how this crime has evolved.
So where was the chicken?
At that rate, he can't have gotten far.
Poor slob, I guess he just couldn't escape his past.
Round up the usual suspects. Start with Darwin.
Keep searching. There has to be some link we're missing here.
What sick bastard would wipe out a whole phylum like this?
All I can tell you is that the case is evolving.
No leads yet, but the case is quickly evolving.
We are missing a link here, sergeant.
Take note, kid. These clues are rapidly evolving.
It’s as if he just got up and walked away!
It is critical that we determine who the genus is behind this.
Well, the situation has certainly evolved.
It appears that it was a very slow death.
Check if anyone has filed a Missing Link report.
Has all the markings of the Darwin Gang.
This is no simple drive-by. This is a crime that evolved over time.
Round up every sick Darwinian you can find who's packing chalk.
It's only theory; we'll never prove it.
We can rule out anyone in the scientific community.
To crack this case we've got to answer two questions. 1:What connects the victims? and 2: Why were they jaywalking?
In this case revenge was served in permafrost.
The cause of death is still unknown but I’m guessing it was painfully slow.
O’Shaunnesy, I don’t like where this is headed.
That's a nice theory, Officer Darwin. But without proof that's ALL it is.
Put the missing link under police protection
The Creationism killer strikes again.
We should look for an anti-Darwinist. I'm guessing Betsy Devos in the classroom with a chalkboard.
I swear I'll solve this, even if it takes me a million years.
This is clearly one of Darwins jobs again.
Officer Darwin, I don’t like how this case is evolving.
Ya see kid? Tails were the real victim here.
Put an APB out on the missing link.
I suspect it all started with a big bang.
Do the chalk outlines look intelligently designed to you?
How could this happen? I thought we had put a tail on the tall one.
This has evolved into quite a crime scene.
Looks like a clear case of homicidus erectus to me.
Okay. Got a Homo habilis here, a Homo erectus, and a Homo--cide.
"I guess this is what 'draining the swamp' is all about.
I don't know, I still think God could have done it.
The Creationist is at it again.
Get cold case down here.
This case will be unsolvable without the missing link.
Check the neighborhood. See if anyone heard a big bang.
Let’s get a warrant for Betsy Devos.
Keep this quiet until we notify the next of fin.
The fittest don't always survive now, do they?
It was Darwin.
I don't care what the evidence says, it's still just a theory.
It's an evolving situation.
Chalk it up to evolution!
What was the time of death…within an eon or two?
Looks like the crime scene is evolving.
His taste for killing has evolved.
Well, I guess we’ll never know who was fittest.
Get me Darwin.
The killer had a long history with the victim.
Round up the usual suspects, starting with Banksy...
I'm calling the Vice President in for questioning.
I don’t like how this case is evolving
What made you call us at the Cold Case Unit?
Where do we place the president?
What do you think is the next step?
Put a tail on him!
Some guy says he heard a big bang first.
Notify Mr. Pence that 6,000 years of evolution has come to an end.
Looks like someone from the Texas Board of Education has been here.
Another day, another random act of genetic mutation.
J walking at rush hour, they were just asking for a Darwin award.
Now if we could just find the missing link...
I think the creationists did it.
Well this is really one for the ages
Looks tough, do we have a theory?
Tell the press the investigation is evolving.
This looks a lot like something I haven’t seen in ages.
You got a better theory?
We need a time of death, and don't give me that Jurassic stuff again.
Ah, clearly natural causes...
I guess none of them was the fittest.
Evolution, but that's just my theory.
Well we can narrow it down to sometime between Cretaceous and this afternoon.
Despite the evidence, some politicians don’t believe this crime ever happened.
Don't draw any conclusions yet. It's an evolving crime scene.
I suspect our murderer is a creationist.
I have a theory about this.
How on Earth are we going to notify next of kin?
And you say they didn't teach this in your school?
Any clue where we go from here?
Well this case has really evolved
I didn't take that long to get here, did I?
That's a nice theory detective, but can you prove it?
We're finally getting legs on this investigation.
We have everything but a motive.
There's no way one guy is behind all of this.
Evolution's a bitch, then you die...
Well Officer, it’s clear that he was shot with an evolver
Tell me: What kind of a lunatic would murder a fish, a reptile, an ape, and a man?
Too bad.... his past finally caught up with him.
Let’s see how this case evolves.
I guess we can rule out Intelligent Design.
Apparently he refused to sleep with the fishes.
And yet, the killer spared the Archaeopteryx. Curious.
Forensics will have a field day!
Look for a car with a Christian fish on the bumper.
I hope our witness is a stand-up guy.
It's a shame. He was an upstanding citizen ... eventually.
But is it a crime when it's so intelligently designed?
Is Darwin a person of interest?
This wasn't premeditated... it was natural selection.
We know one thing: The killer is not a fundamentalist Christian.
It appears to have been a slow-acting poison.
I always knew there was something fishy about this guy.
Sergeant, I have a theory about this case.
The crime scene appears to be evolving.
You got a theory on what happened here Darwin?
There will be hell to pay if anybody monkeys around with this evidence.
I know how it looks, but this was a crime of intelligent design.
Looks like an evolving case to me.
Evolutionary my dear Officer Watson.
Get Intelligent Design down here, see what they come up with.
This could take awhile.
Did anyone phyla complaint?
Well, it's just a theory.
My theory on this case is evolving
My theory is evolving.
Chalk this one up to Darwin
It appears the victims were related.
So you say the steamroller never saw them
Clearly this is the work of a 6-Day Creationist.
This is a case for Darwin.
Getting to the root of this may take awhile.
I have some theories.
Biologically speaking, only one of these can be considered a cold-blooded murder.
The Darwin Gang strikes again!
I'm not saying it was sudden, mind you.
I really don't like how this case is evolving.
I thought something about him was fishy.
But where did the first one come from?
Good thing the coroner isn't Republican.
Our theories on the suspect are evolving.
Well, I've got a theory.
Since we started working on this case it has really evolved.
This crime clearly took some time.
Be careful. We can't let this case evolve any further.
Poor guy was probably just a victim of natural selection
It looks like he may have just stood up and walked away...
Well, it's clear his methods are evolving.
We have a suspect, but it's only a theory at this point.
These victims weren't chosen randomly. The killer is using natural selection.
The cause of death, officer, was natural selection
This could be one for the ages.
If only we could have gotten here 540 million years sooner.
It's not a textbook case in this state.
Evolutionary, my dear Sgt. Watson.
The clues don'y quite add up, Farnsworth. If only we could find the missing link.
Get me biology, we need to establish the timeline.
You chalked it up? To what, stupidity???
Nothing's more vicious than natural selection.
The killer seemed to select his victims naturally.
I've been on this case for a while now.
We really have to improve the speed of our police cars.
Just tell the press that our investigation is evolving.
Looks like another case of pre-pre-pre-pre-medititaded murder.
The crime scene is still evolving.
I guess standing erect makes you more of a target.
We've narrowed it down to a creationist.
Could be a copycat extinction.
Bring in Charles Darwin for questioning.
The killer is the missing link
That’s one theory....
Round up the kids from the Museum of Natural History sleepover. Check their hands for chalk residue.
Well Detective Darwin...any theories as to what happened here?
'Seems we're missing a link here.'
The science deniers have gone too far this time.
If I could just find the missing link.
But why kill the victim's entire family?
I'm beginning to see a pattern.
Looks like Darwin's back in town.
The forensic boys believe the murders are linked.
Well this kills that theory.
I still don't think it's proof.
Looks like this case is still evolving.
Have you heard Lt. Darwin's theory on this?
It seems the killer's pattern is evolving.
We have a lead, but it's really just a theory.
My gut tells me this isn’t random.
Looks like the weapon was an evolver.
It looks like this was an intelligently designed murder.
Fortunately, the serial killer left us his carbon footprints.
It took us ages to reconstruct.
We couldn't solve this crime in a million years.
I say we put Detective Darwin on this one.
It was a crime 6,000,000 years in the making.
The evidence is definitely evolving.
This could take years.
The middle one kinda looks like my mother-in-law.
It's as I said. The case is evolving.
Well, it's just a theory, but...
It’s only a matter of time before our killer strikes again.
Witnesses at the church could not believe what they saw.
This was clearly an attack on science.
The way he selects his victims...it's so...natural.
Some of these have been dead awhile
When they go after your family, they don't kid around!
What do we tell the press? Let's just say the victims are five members of an extended family.
I know this guy. He has a history.
As Holmes might say, 'Evolutionary, my dear Watson.'
The statute of limitations has clearly run on all but the last of these victims
They all seem to be somehow related.
It will be interesting to see how this case evolves.
Civilization, as we know it, is dead.
It explains everything but the fedora
Even the fittest can’t survive in this town.
I'm guessing the suspect will be a creationist, ... middle-aged, ...a loner ...
I hate working these cold cases.
A man, a woman, a snake, an apple and a garden. Why, what do you see?
I want this crime scene kept secured; the details of this case are evolving.
Only one question remains. Were their deaths random, or was it natural selection?
I see a pattern evolving.
Life has a way of catching up with you.
I’ve got a theory
All the victims were in the same family.
It's evolutionary, my dear Watson.
We can prove the pattern, but will they believe us?
My theory is evolving.
I have an evolving theory.
I say we charge them with a violation of Genesis 1:24.
Put an APB out on the missing link.
For the last time, I said it was just a theory.
Looks like another winner of the Darwin Award.
Well, it’s no Abbey Road.
I can't help but feel like there's something missing.
Round up the usual scientists.
Would you call this style creationist? Or is it more of an intelligent design?
The coroner marks the last time of death around 12,000 BC.
What worries me is the one that evolved from this guy and is still around here somewhere!
This looks like the work of a very old crime family.
Poor sap. He was only 2 million years away from retirement.
We’re missing something.
Bring in Darwin for questioning.
I have a theory about what happened, but it's only a theory.
This looks fishy from the start; where's the missing link?
It started with a big bang.
Who in creation would do this?
That Texas Board of Education better have an alibi.
looks like it took a long time to die
Frankly we will have to wait and see this case evolves.
Obviously, the killer took his time.
I want a list of all creationists within a five-mile radius.
Sorry, cant help you here. I went to Catholic school.
Poor fella, never should have left the sea...
My theory is, these are all the same guy.
Just a hunch, but I think the victims may be related.
Let's get Darwin on the case, he's good at knowing how things evolve.
It's too early to come to any conclusions ... the case is still evolving.
I think the butler did it.
Things evolved pretty quickly.
Just tell them the investigation is evolving.
I know we're missing something, a link perhaps.
I'm guessing creationists did them in.
I always said his miserable past would finally catch up with him.
My views on this case have evolved.
I'd say it was an act of God but....
Evoloutionary, Detective Watson.
They were just crossing the road? Then where’s the chicken?
Nice theory Sheriff, but I think we should just see how this case evolves.
A pattern is starting to evolve.
Well, that theory’s dead.
You’ve got me, Rogers. It could take eons to solve this one.
This looks like it will be an evolving case.
She should have never left the ocean
It's murder, but was it random or by design?
We finally have the evidence we need.
The solution is evolutionary my dear.
The time of death will be hard to determine.
I guess we should have seen this coming
This appears to be the work of a serial killer, although trying to predict his next victim may take a great deal of time.
I have a theory, but once again, there's a missing link.
This looks like a highly evolved crime!
We'll need an APB for a suspect between the ages of 4 and 8 million.
And your telling me that witnesses say it all happened in just a few seconds?
There must be a link here.
Do we know if the victims are related?
I have a theory on who did it but it’s evolving
We're gonna have to let this case evolve over time.
Well, we know the victim wasn't Christian.
It'll be interesting to see how far back this goes...
Has Darwin been notified?
Well, looks like that theory is dead
I have a theory about this.
Cause of death?" "Natural selection
I guess he's the end of his line.
Don't be hasty Sergeant, it could be nothing more than an intelligent design
I’d say we’ve traced this crime back to its genesis.
It looks like he made it this far... But, no farther.
We think the perp is Charlie “the knife” Darwin, but the case is still evolving
No, they didn't die like this, we just had some fun with the chalk.
And you’ve been working the case for how long?
Yeh? You got a better theory?
One thing we know for sure: these murders occurred over an extremely long time.
What's not to get? The victim was obviously a New Yorker cartoonist.
I disagree. This crime is clearly the result of an intelligent design.
Witnesses said the whole thing evolved quickly.
Solving this crime was always just a matter of time.
We're looking for a man with opposable thumbs.
If we can find the fittest, we'll have our man.
Get Darwin, now.
Please keep the chalk away from Officer Darwin.
Let’s just tell them, “What started as a simple case continues to evolve.”
There may have been a crime here, but it is "just a theory".
It’s a crime of the eon.
This one's easy. The human did it.
I’d look for the missing link.
Looks like a family feud going way back.
What do I do Jim? The evidence keeps evolving.
Seems the killer really took his time here.
We’ve got another Texas Board of Ed copycat on our hands, Joe.
My understanding of this case is rapidly evolving.
This case has Darwin written all over it.
I don't think you're quite ready to hear my theory.
I’m starting to see a pattern.
I never thought I’d live long enough to see this.
I’ve always wondered if there was such a thing as too much evidence.
I guess they weren't the fittest after all.
Our case is still evolving.
Get an archaeologist to call time of death!
This is going to take forever!
It’s just a theory but...
After 100 million years you'da thought he'da learned to avoid this neighborhood after dark.
My view on this case is evolving.
Looks like we've got ourselves a case of unnatural selection.
Unless I miss my guess, this is the work of the Ancestry.com Killer.
We need to go back to the beginning.
This was no heat-of-the-moment crime.
Get me the best evolutionary zoology criminology psychologist we've got.
It was a slow death.
As you can see, the case is evolving.
I don't know, the missing link just isn't there.
If he was walking backwards we've got a tough case
A victim of natural selection.
That must have been one hell of a conga line.
The murderer? Why it’s evolutionary, my dear Watson.
Well, Marge, I have a theory, but it's going to be hard to prove.
Another theory shot down.
Call it a hunch, but I think we're dealing with different killers here.
I think we're looking for a fundamentalist
Round up the usual Creationists.
This case just keeps evolving.
It looks like natural causes.
It was a slow death.
Well, that's one theory.
The neighbors said they heard a big bang.
I've seen this only once before...as a beat cop on Galápagos.
Evidently it was a slow death.
Call it a hunch, Stephens, but I doubt he'll strike again for at least another couple million years.
Clearly a vicious killer to have taken out his entire family tree.
And that, Sgt. Blodgett, is the evolution of the modern crime scene.
It appears the victims shared a common ancestor.
"This case will evolve on its own".
This case is still evolving...
Get Detective Darwin here, STAT!
The situation is evolving.
This case is evolving faster than we thought.
We're learning that the ties between the victims go way back.

The boys back at the lab say there may be a connection.
This could be the crime of the ages, Chuck.
Looks to be a crime that evolved over a long period of time.
This case is evolving much quicker than I expected
Evolution was such a dangerous road to travel in the first place.
...but no law was broken, only a theory was
I’ve identified the weapon. It was definitely a rEvolver.
Stop evolving and die. That's the way of the world, Officer Smith.
What a nerve! When we catch the perp we'll throw the bible at him!
God knows who the next victim might be . . .
we don't have a suspect, the case is still evolving
So what is your theory on how this case evolved?
It's a fast evolving crime scene.
And we're sure this isn't just Banksy again?
Better call in CSI, seems like there's a link missing.
This is definitely an evolving crime scene.
I know this case is still evolving, but I feel there's an intelligent design that ties it together.
What a shame. He only had one day left before extinction.
This turf war goes way back.
We get it, Banksy. You’re clever.
Evolve or die? This time it’s evolve _and_ die.
What events led up to this tragedy? Well, let's start at the beginning.
Banksy?
It’s Evolution my dear Watson.
I remember when this used to be confined to a few minivans. It's a real shame to see this spill over in our streets.
Let's just say the investigation is evolving.
Well, we know this guy had history
Events leading to the infamous “Scopes Murder Trial.”
Well....let’s wait to see what develops.
This investigation is evolving nicely.
This'll take ages.
They never learn, do they?
Looks like another School Board hit. Last week it was Dallas and Houston.
This guy definitely took his time.
Looks like he was the archetype of his own demise.
Th Evangelists will love this: Evolution is dead!
Looks like the work of a creationist.
I always knew there was something fishy about him.
I guess my question is... who's next?
Tell the press that the case is evolving.
This murder must've been premeditated for millions of years.
I guess it’s death of the fittest.
'Let's wait and see how this case evolves.'
I’m beginning to see how this crime evolved.
Poor guy. He died a slow death.
I'm not sure. It's an evolving story
Well, we don't have to send his DNA to 23andMe!
This case continues to evolve before my eyes
Any theories Chief?
Are you sure they're related?
Organized crime really is evolving.
Round up the usual biologists.
Tell the Chief the crime seen is still evolving
Interesting theory, but beyond the statute of limitations
What do you estimate as the time of death?
Sure, it looks like an intelligent design, but how do you prove it?
A classic case, Officer Darwin, of death by devolution.
It quickly evolved into manslaughter.
I'm beginning to evolve a theory of the crime.
hmmm...looks like the work of the guy who killed climate change
You're telling me this all happened last night?
after mankind killed them all; he committed suicide.
We will see how the investigation evolves...
Looks like the killer and the victims were both coldblooded this time.
They may be related, but something's missing.
The facts are evolving, I see.
wow, they got the whole family, going back GENERATIONS!
I'm guessing his attorney is Clarence Darrow.
We have a number of suspects, but the case is still evolving.
Whoever did this planned this for a long tome...and waited.
Such a waste, he was already near extinction.
This is no accident. It took 4.6 billion years to pull off.
Give me another 50 million years and I'll nail this guy.
I think we have a Darwin copycat
They shouldn’t be too difficult to trace.
Round up the usual suspects, even if they're fossilized.
We have to work fast. We only have 350,000 years before the killer strikes again.
The only evidence we have so far is pretty sketchy.
The real mystery is whose next.
Better put in a call for an anthropologist, a paleontologist and the medical examiner.
We need to look for a creationist, I do believe.
Hmm, looks like a case of arrested development.
The victims appear related.
Looks like a case for Bill Nye the Science Guy
This may be the missing link!
Unfortunately, the human victim was our best Phylogenetic Crimes Investigator.
What a shame—killed just as he became a man.
And you're telling me this all happened in one day?
I should've paid attention in biology
The creationists strike again!
The killer’s modus operandi is clearly evolving.
I just need to find the missing link...
I think our killer is evolving.
The clue may be in the missing tail.
This crime is evolving.
Smell that? It's a scent of man.
I think they all deserve the Darwin award
And no one survived ?
Round-up the usual anti-Darwinists
This case is really starting to evolve
Another dead end.
Creationists!
Well, it's still a developing story.
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.
Round up the usual "Intelligent Design" suspects.
These streets have never been safe.
There was only one survivor. Described as very fit.
Looks like the Serial Evolutionary Biologist struck again.
Most certainly a serial killer.
We can assume that the victims weren't Creationists.
This case just seems to keep evolving with every step...
First Billy Graham and now this?
Strange... it seems he just stood up and walked away
Our view of the victim is evolving.
The killer is very patient.
I think this case will evolve slowly.
Obviously, it's a serial killing.
IT APPEARS WE HAVE A DARWINIAN SERIAL KILLER HERE!
Make sure there is no missing link in the chain of custody of the evidence.
I wish I understood the killer's selection process.
The suspect is still at large, but he's got a tail on him.
The evidence regarding this case seems to be rapidly evolving.
Go back to the beginning and tell me again, what happened?
I assumed they just wanted to discredit the theory, not actually kill evolution.
Make me a list of every Creationist in town.
He died a very slow death.
Let’s just say that my thinking on the case has evolved.
This case is definitely evolving, but that's just a theory.
I don’t know what’s more upsetting, losing my family like this, or Ted’s depiction of my kids.
This looks like an evolving case.
Contact detective Darwin. He's good at these cases.
Guess you could call this natural selection.
My theory is still evolving.
Get Sergeant Darwin down here immediately.
Hmmm, evolution AND extinction. Tough one.
It started as a poaching case but clearly evolved into murder.
Looks like someone's trying to frame Darwin again.
Keep me updated as the situation evolves.
How did you get evolved in this?
Well. we can rule out Darwin as a suspect.
We better call Detective Darwin on this one. And tell him to bring his beagle.
"Good heavens, they finally got all the family in one shot.
I don’t think these all occurred at the same time.
Let's just tell the press that the situation is still evolving...
Call HR. This has diversity written all over it.
Despite what happened here, I still love a parade.
Evolution of a dead man walking!
Looks like they've been mowed down by a time machine.
"His choice of victims seems to be evolving".
I'll be damned if I can figure out the missing link here.
We call this Darwin’s hopscotch.
They tried to make it look like natural selection.
The case is evolving: our perp will be the fittest among them.
Looks like that damn Darwin again.
My view on this case is evolving.
Creationists have gone too far this time!
Fake news.
Looks like the boys in homoerecticide got it cut out for ‘em.
We don’t have any suspects yet, but the case is still evolving.
Call Detective Darwin.
What happened? Well, I've got a theory...
Assign this case to detective Darwin.
I see the Creationists are at it again.
So, they weren't the fittest after all.
The evidence points to Darwin, but it's still just a theory.
Have we run a check on that guy Darwin yet?
This one's gonna take quite a while.
It all seemed to end right here.
The facts of his life and past are completely clear. Now we have to find the killer before he strikes AGAIN and Again and again and again and again.
I suspect Creationism
Looks like another Missing Link case. Get me Charles Darwin!
This is a first. The evolution of a crime, perfectly preserved.
Seems like an organized crime.
We stilll can’t find that missing link to tie this whole case together!
I have a strange feeling this case is going to evolve slowly over a long period of time.
Looks like God's not the only one who's dead anymore.
It looks like the victim was chosen by natural selection
If this case evolves any more, it will be beyond me.
God did it, case closed.
Clearly not a case of random selection.
Ask inspector Darwin for his theory on this one.
I guess he hit an evolutionary dead-end.
Obviously, there have been some developments on the case.
There is only one possible motive; extinction!
I think we're dealing with a serial Biblical literalist.
Looks to me like the way this guy chooses his victims is evolving.
Finally! This is the missing link we need to crack this case wide open.
Apparently, this case is still evolving.
Why don't we see how this case evolves?
The good news is the fittest survived!
So then the mystery is what comes next
Looks like someone met an evolutionary dead end.
I can't believe it evolved into this.
Have we established time of death yet? (Suggested by my 11 yr old son, Owen)
The victims seem to have something in common.
I wonder whether they are all related?
Geezus. Anothe crime of ... Biblical proportions.
My analysis is evolving.
Looks like genocide to me.
Although the case seems to evolve, we still can't find the missing link.
I can’t help feeling that we’re missing something?
Something is missing
See if Agent Darwin is available.
I'll say they've been here a long time.
There's something missing here.
I don't like the way this case is progressing.
We're calling him the "food chain" serial killer.
Here's my theory...
I suspect the church.
I suspect Darwin.
I sense a missing link.
Round up the missing links.
I hate themes.
Evolution is Dead
No suspects yet, but the investigation is evolving.
Call the Intelligent Design Squad.
This is the second-slowest evolving crime scene I've encountered.
Took 'em long enough...
In this America, evolution is dead.
I may have just solved our case! ... but it just a theory.
Looks like we need to put Detective Darwin on this one.
Definitely the most rapidly evolving case I have ever seen.
...Well, that's my theory, anyway.
From primate to prime suspect.
Most serial killers start with animals.
Obviously the work of a deranged Creationist!
It's an interesting theory, but some people may not want to believe it.
You’re right sergeant, the perp’s pattern is definitely evolving........
Something here looks fishy.
My theory on this case is still evolving.
I have a theory about what happened.
Actually yes, I do have a theory.
What we're witnessing is the evolution of a serial killer.
My theory of whodunnit is still evolving.
The victim’s name was Darwin.....Charles Darwin.
I don't believe the fish but the rest seems ok
We have no clue who will be next.
I think Darwin had this same problem.......
I'd say that our suspect has a pretty long-standing grudge.
We'd better turn this one over to Inspector Darwin.
Did they know the ascendant?
Well this case evolved quickly.
It seems as if accidents have been happening here forever.
I guess it's pretty clear how this crime evolved...
Hmm... there must be a missing link between these victims
It all seems a bit sketchy, if you ask me.
We need Detective Darwin; these clues keep evolving.
Looks like the trilobite got away from the murderer. Find out if it saw anything.
We're working with an evolving crime scene.
So then, it appears the situation evolved swiftly.
Just like the others but what's the missing link?
Time of death estimates vary, but first responders say sometime after the Early Devonian Period
You're out there somewhere Natural Selection...and I'm going to find you.
Our theory of the case is evolving, Chief.
Creationists? No proof. Looks like the work of the Darwin gang to me.
The suspect had been quietly at large for 5 million years.
Let's see where the DNA points us
They had a lineup at headquarters and the witness made a natural selection.
Fishy? Originally. But now the facts on the ground are evolving.
God. I think I know who did it.
I like Scopes for this one, but I just don't think we can bring it to trial.
Would've been simpler just to take out Darwin.
Notify the families, but don’t worry about the fish.
Darwin again.
This is definitely going to be a fast-evolving investigation.
The DNA didn't narrow it down much.
this case is evolving into a human tradgedy
I think I can figure out the chain of events.
This is definitely the work of a radical crayon-tionist group.
Round up the usual hominids.
Yet more evidence... of evolution. We must hide this from Pense.
The evidence is evolving.
We got a tip this would happen from a fella named Darwin.
I'd say it was a crime of family, genus, species, kingdom, phyllum....
What do you think, Detective Darwin? Even the fittest didn't survive.
My theory on who did it continues to evolve!
If it's evolution vs a bus, evidently the bus wins.
I asked for the forensic biologist, not the evolutionary biologist!
And yet he managed to disappear without a trace.
I hear the case is developing.
Start rounding up the "Intelligent Design" gang for questioning.
Let's bring Mr. Darwin in for questioning.
The details are still evolving.
This case is beginning to evolve.
Darwin no doubt.
It's clear to me that something fishy happened here.
Looks like a Crime Against Humanity.
I've seen a lot of things, but this is downright primeval.
It's an evolving investigation.
All cases evolve. This one's faster than usual.
We should have a suspect soon once the case evolves.
Detective Darwin. Is this the end of evolution?
The case continues to evolve
I've been tailing this guy for years.
It's going to take a long time to figure this one out.
Better round up the usual creationists
'Mmm, I think Banksy got inspired by a fish.' 'You mean a Haring?'
He's from one of the oldest crime families we can trace.
Put out an APB for William Jennings Bryan
This murder case just keeps evolving.
It's clear the evidence in this case will be evolving for some time.
No, his seemingly random selection of victims is all too natural.
There must be a connection somewhere.
We don't see a connection. Hopefully, the DNA will show the missing link.
How do you think the Creationists will try to explain this?
We have a witness heard him scream "Recapitulate THIS!" --just before all hell broke loose.
Clearly, this is the work of some Neanderthal tryin' to hide his past.
and you suspect A.I.?
I have a theory but remember, its just a theory!
Looks like we've got a case of homicide erectus.
They tried so hard to be an upstanding family
It's an evolving mystery.
Lieutenant Darwin has a theory about this case.
Get Detective Darwin over here pronto.
This was no accident, the killer really, really took his time
Something about this one extincts...
I think we need to start from the beginning.
I dunno, hard to say who the real victim is here....
Looks like we're at the end of the line!
The death of evolution... Jan, get me a list of every Protestant church within the area.
There's a step missing...
It's tough to say. The case is still evolving.
Things seem to be evolving here.
What has two legs in the morning, four in the afternoon and is a hit-and-run victim?
It seems clear the death was not instantaneous.
It would seem that the killer's MO involved an intelligent design.
We seem to have a very old serial killer.
Hmmm. This case seems to be evolving.
It's a real shame - the whole family, in one fell swoop.
This looks like a really cold case.
Have you evolved a theory of the case?
Bring in Natural Selection for questioning. While you’re at it, get me that slime ball Evolution as well.
It's pretty clear how the crime evolved. The real question is, who did it?
Probably time to put up a traffic light.
Forensics show the victims had a family resemblance.
I see the killer's evolving.
Uh huh. And Darwin also figured it would take us another million years to find out who did it.
This will be a tough one to crack. Did the victim evolve from a fish or devolve to a fish?
The only evidence we have, at this point, is that the crime evolved very slowly.
In this neighborhood .. the victim was clearly a fish out of water.
This guy's crimes are evolving.
Better call Darwin, he might have a theory on this
The evolutionists are really desperate to prove their point.
I thought Darwin already solved this one.
Clearly, there's no intelligent design in this crime.
Well, where did it go? It can't just grow legs and walk away!
The DNA analysis is going to be hell.
My theory here is evolving.
What do you think, Detective Darwin?
I have an explanation, but it's only a theory
The situation on the ground is evolving
I’d say ‘Now he’s in a better place,’ but that’s what he said the last few times.
I guess the opposable thumb wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
I'm guessing the killer's probably not a Creationist.
The difficulty with this case is the DNA evidence keeps changing.
It's the end of civilization as we know it.
What kind of a depraved individual does something like this to a poor little fish?
Looks like the anti-evolutionist lobby is changing tactics..
They're killing Evolution in our schools, too.
There’s your evidence. Arrest Darwin.
Looks to me like the perp had all the time in the world.
It will be hard to establish a time of death.
I believe this is the work of a very slow serial killer.
Go Fish.
Walk Don’t Walk. Crawl Don’t Crawl. Swim Don’t Swim. Yeah, the signs are all here.
This tragedy was a long time in the making.
We were hot on his tail until....well...it just disappeared
Definitely the work of the Cookie Cutter
Mon Dieu Hercule. Ze killer he is evolving!
So, its evolved to this.
They were shot extinction style.
Does Donald Trump have a tail?
There is something fishy about all this.
It could be anyone except the Republican Party.
Looks like a slow death.

Guess there's something fishy about all of us
What are we missing that links these crimes?
The situation continues to evolve.

Looks like the evidence is still evolving
Nah, I wouldn't call it fishy anymore. I'd say the investigation is evolving.
The D.A. wants us to go back a few more eons.
I guess he didn’t want to leave the family behind.
No way it was premeditated.
Darwin is at it again.
The killer had been tracking them for some time.
Looks like a serial killer with a really long past.
Looks like we might be next.
This will take millions of years to solve, lets go to lunch.
Seems a clear case of evolutionary anomaly.
I'm just worried about what's next.
I'm betting creationism is behind this!
Even the fittest didn't survive
Looks like this case is evolving into something!
Clearly, the next victim will be a New Yorker reader. Notify the editor immediately.
His technique is clearly evolving.
I wish we knew where this case was going.
So what other theories do you have?
We're tracing this crime to its source.
Put out an APB for a homicidal evolutionary anthropologist.
Something's fishy here.
Looks like the Paleozoic killer has struck again.
This case is taking forever
Hold on ... this story’s still evolving.
Word has it he's lived here as long as anyone can remember.
Someone finally killed Darwin's theory.
My thoughts on the case are evolving . . .
My theory is still evolving, but I think we need to talk to the fish.
There's a link here that we're missing.
There's something fishy about this whole case.
We need to compare this to the evidence from the Scopes trial.
Obviously the work of a creationist.
The genesis of this case escapes me.
Looks like he had it coming.
It looks like the work of The Creationist
Get Detective Darwin down here.
I am pretty sure our man was able to crawl before he could walk
Same old, same old.
I say we drag the swamp.
Is there any link between the victims?
I say let the fish in. It's billions of years before Homeland will worry.
...just wondering where they headed to
See how these criminals are evolving?
Tough case. All the DNA is DOA.
Be careful. He comes from a long line of over achievers.
Seems like textbook evolutionary manslaughter
Warn all robots. They may be in danger.
This was clearly the work of a creationist.
Given the evidence, I would say this could take a long time to solve . .
This was no normal homicide .
Another day, another evolving crime scene.
I think this crime is intelligently designed.
This crime appears to be centuries in the making.
Damn Creationists...
Clearly, the killer spent a lot of time preparing for these murders.
Approximate time of death?...I’d say the Jurassic period..
OK, round up the unusual suspects.
The one at the front gives us the most concern ...
With no discernable relationship among the victims, I am one stumped Creationist.
It’s true, Officer. Evolution is a killer.
Looks to me like this happened slowly, gradually, over a long period of time.
Do you think they were selected naturally?
You can really see how the killer's victims evolved.
It’s unsolvable. The crime scene is evolving.
It appears we have a theoryal killer on our hands.
Evolutionary, my dear Watson; it was the genes!
It's only a matter of time...
The suspect was most likely a Creationist.
Yes, Sgt. Darwin, it does appear to be an evolving case!
Issue an APB for a single-celled organism of interest.
Don’t you just hate to see that to someone with their whole future ahead of them?
Apparently the killer had plenty of time to finish off his victim.
Make sure to send DNA samples from each of them to Ancestry.com
Are you sure these are all the usual suspects?
This is definitely a job for our cold case unit.
It's the survival of the fittest in these streets.
This can only have been the act of a brutal and insane creationist.
Better call Darwin.
Call the 29th Precinct. Ask for Detective Darwin.
I think the press is going to have a field day with the evolution of this case!
It appears after he was shot, the victim took a series of many small steps over a very long period.
We find the missing link, we find our murderer.
The investigation is evolving.

Ontogeny? Phylogeny? Sergeant, your guess is as good as mine.
I believe this scene has proven that we were sharks, not gorillas.
I'm afraid he just won the Darwin Award.
This was no drive-by shooting. Obviously, the murder evolved over several eons.
It's definitely the leading theory.
His misfortune to be a fish out of water.
Well, Lucy, it looks like we've got a real history of violence here.

Looks like the work of the Creation Science gang.
Lets just wait and see what evolves before jumping to any conclusions
Forget it, Jake, it's Creationtown.
I'd say the evidence is evolving.
Yup. That proves it.
I’d say he had it coming to him.
So, here’s my theory...
With this new evidence, the case is getting less fishy.
How long have you been working on this case?
Thousands of years later this case is still unsolved.
Just another fish out of water story...
This case is going to take awhile.
Looks like the crime of several millennia!
If only we had the missing link...
Well, Sargent, at least this case is evolving nicely.

I think it was the intelligent design guys.
You think maybe phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny?
Perpetrator's been around forever.

This was not an intelligently designed crime.
I thought it was a single event, but now we have proof--our suspect is evolving.
That's life. One day you go fishing and a hundred million years later you end up a dead man!

It's not fact, it's just a theory
Take a note that it’s just a theory
Well, this is evolving into quite the crime scene....
Processing this will take millennia.
If I were E.T. I'd be worried.
Looks like another Darwin Award for us.
Another case of Serial Darwinism
I've seen the one in the middle before.
No, it's not a crime scene. It's Andy Warhol's EVOLUTION
Do you think it's a copy-cat?
We're looking for someone with a motive against a fish, a scaly-walk-y thing, a walk-y thing with no neck, a half-monkey with a J-tail, and a dude in the middle of a step.
I think evolution killed itself.
A deity complex. It took him six days and he rested on the seventh.

The crime scene is evolving as we speak.
I think I'm beginning to normalize Trump.
...oh, and check the statute of limitation on evolution.
Hard to say who died first.
Tell the lab to be sure to get a complete DNA sampling for this one.
Not a bad theory, but whoever committed this crime definitely had an intelligent design.
This case evolved even before I got here...
This case is evolving a lot faster then we thought.
We are dealing with inter-special serial killer
Trust me, we’ll need to be lucky with DNA to crack this one.
Evolution: Crime Scene
We think it started with the trout.
to cross the Stygian- ferry

Another family reunion run amuck.
I'm Gould of the Yard. Harvard Yard.
This takes me back to my first year at the academy, all those lectures about the evolution of crime. Now I really understand.
Just a primal hunch O’Shannesy, but, I’d say the victims were all related
Clearly an evolutionary dead end.
Even if they are the culprits, what’s the motive?
Not another nature/nurture defense!
There’s something fishy going on here.
How are investigation has constantly evolving.
Some of these family feuds go way back and are existential.
It is quite obvious that the killer is devolving.
We'll have to go back a long ways to figure how this crime evolved!
His message is quite clear, Grimsley. He's evolving!
All evidence lead to an extinction.
Ah, the evolution of death.
In this city, it truly is survival of the fittest ...
The trick is going to be finding the missing link that pieces this all together.
Well that's the whole family tree
It's worse than I thought, an unnatural natural selection rejection.
Well, we can rule out Evangelicals.
the victim was between 40 Billion and 10,000 years old
The next one will have golf clubs in his hands.
Now that’s what I call an evolving crime scene!
Jaywalkers are almost extinct. When I was still a beat cop, they walked and talked and now they text last words.
There's something fishy here...
I'd say global warming, but it's so cold today.
...if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny that dolphin must have been a real mean motherfucker...
I guess that eliminates creationists from suspicion.
I think this perp has evolved since the last case, but’s it just a theory.
Well, this certainly is an evolving crime scene.
Be ready for a creationist backlash after the press conference.
I guess the Darwin haters are just going to hate.

Evol
The chalk points to Darwin.
Looks like means of natural selection
Lucky us. An evolving crime site.
It appears we’ve discovered the missing link.
Back in the old days here in Kansas City, I'd say they were victims of evolution. Nowadays, we''ll just have to wait and see how the investigation evolves.

We are seeking Charles Darwin for questioning.
Apparently his methods have evolved.
Darwin. Charles Darwin. With the Homo Erectucide Division. The Chief calls me in on cases like this.
Who's next? Your guess is as good as mine.
More victims of the culture wars
Looks like the evilutionist is on the move again.
These Darwinians have a sick sense of humor
I'm afraid that these, too, are victims of the War on Science.

A loner's still theory. We haven't a tail to hang it on.
I'm afraid we've got a loooonnnnggg serial killer on our hands.
Evolution denier, that's my guess!
That's an interesting theory, but I'm still not ready to rule out the lead Johnson got from his pastor.
The saddest part is wondering what might have been.
Yeah, human evolution is definitely dead.
Ok sir, take your time. Do you recognize any of these suspects?
Open and shut case, Darwin strikes again.
Investigate the beagle.
Somebody was clearly hoping this would wipe out all evidence of evolution...let's check the churches first.
It's an evangelical crime
Wonder what Chief Darwin will make of this!
I don't know about you, but I think a tail would have been a lot of fun.
What monsters we have become.
My theory of the crime? It's still evolving.

Suspect's last name: Darwin
... and call the Creationist Museum. This is no way to stage a protest!
We may not solve this crime, but at least we can prove Darwin was right.
He's been missing from the classroom since '06.
Just when he was trying to go straight, too.
Poor guy. Looks like he walked right into that one.
You’d think it would’ve evolved to not be such an easy victim by now.
This case looks pretty evolved

It reminds me of the chalk outline creatures I used to raise as a kid. So sad.
So, Officer Darwin, what's your theory of the origin of the crime?
No matter how hard we try to wipe out those damned "science" proselytizers, pockets of resistance remain.
This is one small step for a rat, but a giant leap into the nightmares of human beings.
Well, whoever it was, they were more efficient than the Scopes Monkey Trial.

I've seen this before, Officer, on the walls of that cave in southern France. It's too neat. The evidence all points to nurture versus nature. We'll have to wait for the autopsy. You can't really tell much from the positions of the bodies.
Well that's evolution for you.

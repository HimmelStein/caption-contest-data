It was a very hostile takeover.
It was a very hostile takeover.
The pen is mightier, but that looks awesome.
If you can remove it... it means your heart is pure. But you can no longer work in sales.
I think there's been a mistake. I asked management to give him the axe.
I thought 'willing to work knights' was just a typo.
Now we are at the last task of your interview.
Also, if you can pull the stuck page out of the copier you become the rightful Head of Finance.
No, not the sword. The test is to pull out the middle drawer.
You can have Damocles' old desk.
The pen is taking it pretty hard.
Legend says only someone with a true heart will be able to remove the sword. Unfortunately, we're a law firm.
At least you didn't get the axe.
Oh, it slides right out. But it's a real confidence booster for the new CEO.
It's definitely the sharpest thing to occupy this desk in years.
I see my wife stopped by.
I preferred when they used pink slips.
Thousands have tried and only one succeeded, but he didn't pass the background check.
Legend has it that whoever pulls it out gets a desk with a hole in it.
... and now for the final part of your interview ...
This was Arthur’s office
No, YOU look under the desk.
If you think his letter opener is over the top, you should see his staple remover.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find it mightier than the pen.
the vacancy ad read"must be executive calibre" not Excalibur.
It must have been left here by the knight shift.
Nothing here is set in stone...
It seems as valid a process as the electoral college.
Yet another challenge for which you will discover your MBA is inadequate.
Well, I guess that explains the round table in the board room.
It was a hostile takeover
You’ll be fine, Bill. Just don’t cross your legs.
And he put a big-ass round table in the conference room.
At Camelot Industries, we don't believe in a complicated job application process.
Well, this explains the new massive round table in the boardroom
Call Arthur in maintenance.
If I can’t pull it out after 3 tries does it lock me out of the system?
Don't touch it--if you pull it out, they make you director of Human Resources.
Unfortunately, the benefit plan is a myth as well.
We've installed Excel, Explorer and Excalibur for you.
It really streamlines the interview process
A corded telephone? This workplace is so medieval.
Just one more step to delete your Facebook account.
One last little thing ... and the job is yours.
The shredder is a bit retro I'm afraid, but you don't have to plug it in.
I pulled it out, but returned it after the indictments.
Make yourself at home, Arthur.
He works the knight shift.
He was the knight manager.
We've simplified our new CEO search criteria.
Don't try it. There's a substantial penalty for early withdrawal.
We affectionately call it Deskalibur.
When he asks you to try, just pretend like you can't get it out.
Uh oh, Lance -- the boss knows about you and Guinevere...
Go on, Arthur, let’s find out if you’re the guy we’re looking for
This is the last stage of the interview, Arthur. I've got a good feeling about you.
We've been hacked.
It’s easier than going through all those resumes.
You should see his pen.
If you can pull it out the office is yours. Plus a horse.
No one knows the password.
I liked Lance, sir. A lot.
He lived by the sword. But he died by the window.
Beats the hell out of the Myers-Briggs.
You know what? I think I'll work from home today.
Yeah, I mean they said any honest lawyer could pull it free. But... you know.
Looks like she got your email.
We'll have to get Arthur from personnel to remove it.
He's going really old school in choosing a successor.
That's Exchequer. Whoever pulls it out rules Accounting.
Whosoever draws this sword from this desk shall receive a designated parking spot near the entrance.
The new guy is asking for a round table.
There’s just one final step in your interview process...
The CEO job is as good as yours Arthur.
It's not like him to leave his laptop open.
Arthur, if you can get it out by noon, that'd be great.
Of course you get the job if you pull it out. But if you want benefits you'll need to slay a dragon, and don't even ask what you have to do to join the pension.
I personally think the laptop is mightier, but its up to you.
Well, that's about everyone. Should we let the women try?
This has 'OSHA violation' written all over it.
Call that kid Arthur in Shipping and see if he can pull it out
The job goeth to whoso pulleth out this sword, and whoso also passeth a routine drug test.
Another bad quarter and he'll get the axe.
Whosoever pulls the sword, shall control the thermostat.
It comes right out. Nobody wants the job.
Which one of the 4 items don't belong
No, it's easy to pull out. But if you do, the WiFi signal sucks.
Hey, you know Arthur who works in accounting?" "Get him up here.
We've not found a worthy occupant of this office since Arthur quit the firm.
You can come out now, Mr. President. Melania has left the building.
Call Arthur from accounting, it's happened again.
Tell Merlin in Personnel we may need him.
He didn't get the ax, but, same thing.
Sure, it’s not a stone but this is a junior position.
And if he asks you, just agree that it's mightier than a pen.
It's actually pretty easy. It's just that no-one wants the job.
We have a rather unique succession plan.
I guess the meeting is cancelled.
Yup, if not for his pen he would have been a goner.
It's the restroom key.
We're trying out new ideas for succession. This one was mentioned at our round table discussion.
Our two-factor authentication protocol is legendary.
Our screening process is legendary.
The company legend is that only the greatest backstabber will be able to remove it.
First you pull it out. Then you stick it in the backs of your employees.
If you pull it out you become CEO... but your best friend will sleep with your wife and Mordred in HR will want to see you.
Mightier in what way?
And this will be your office, once we get everything sworded out.
Sir, your wife left a note.
I know what you’re thinking. Yes, the landline is a bit old-fashioned.
No, the guillotine is in our Paris office.
We have a very thorough vetting process.
Strange, I thought he got axed.
No, I haven't tried. I don't really want to rule as King of accounts receivable.
We're having a lot of trouble filling this position.
We have a pretty simple hiring process here...
Corporate culture's a bit medieval here
This is the office for those who free-lance-a-lot.
It's our test for the corner office.
Seriously, a memo would have sufficed.
Sure the pen is mightier, but it looks way less badass.
And here we have the final step in your interview. Good luck.
Only a person without an abusive temperament, one who never covered up a corporate crime or suborned a politician, can wrench the sword free. When that person appears, trumpets will blare and security will usher him or her out of the building.
He says it's a letter opener, but I'm staying on his good side all the same.
So you really think you're the right man for the job?
We keep it here in case there is a time you need to fall on it.
Everyone else has tried, Arthur.
Well, Art, the promotion is certainly within your grasp.
We let Arthur go last year, but we're still trying to send him his things.
We recently started casualty Friday.
We have a new two-step verification system.
They say the pen is mightier, but trust me they are wrong.
I thought he was going to get the axe.
Actually, anyone could pull it out, but no one wants the position.
He'll be mythed.
I just don't see the point.
If you can pull it out you'll also get dental.
Configuring your voicemail will be way harder.
You'll be in accounts and pillages.
Never, never hide underneath the desk.
IT said to pull it out, and then push it back in.
She pulled the sword out okay but then she asked for a raise...
This is the final stage of your interview Mr Arthur
I guess you could say it was a hostile takeover.
Once a week Jared comes in to give it a tug.
...then there's a knot in the VP's office you'll need to take care of.
The job is yours if you can pull it out.
Turns out the sword is mightier than the pen.
A simple resignation letter would have done the trick.
Yeah, the lamp needs to go.
It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it turns out it's really difficult to find a CEO that's pure of heart.
True, it’s not traditional Feng Shui, but it does focus the room’s energy.
Poor Donald. But please tell me that Pence is under there too.
Hmm... I guess the sword IS mightier than the pen!
Art must have just received his ancestry.com results.
... and then the drug test and background check.
My boss hasn't been the same since he went to that Renaissance fair upstate.
The easy part is drawing the sword, but then you must come up with a password that's at least eight characters long, includes a number and a symbol, and that you haven't used in the past six months.
We’re generally a pretty easy-going firm, but some things are set in stone.
One more thing and the job is yours!
Last update I got from him about the report was that he'd taken a stab at it.
I think he said he needed a round table.
Legend says that if you pull it out, you get Ron’s parking spot.
You're lucky - mine's a plowshare.
I thought you said you got the axe.
No one can pull it out. But that has less to do with destiny and more to do with solid mahogany.
If you pull this off, you'll be a legend.
Gives new meaning to the word 'severance'.
Legend has it that one day a just, wise, and equitable CEO will come to pull out the sword. So of course nobody has even bothered to try.
On the plus side, we’ve been without a CEO for ages
We used to engage executive search firms, but this is a lot cheaper and works just as well.
Ignore that, it's just part of the severence package.
Let's wait. He usually only steps out for one brief shining moment.
Oh, we can find someone to pull out the sword. What we need is a CEO that can keep his hands to himself.
The associates are calling it Deskalibur.
But if she succeeds when we let her try, then what?
Having slain the unicorn, this is your next task.
YOU try !! I got a hernia !!
He thinks he's a great manager of people but he can't figure out why his drawer won't open.
At least that's not hanging over his head any more.
It's not what you think. He gets really big letters.
Looks like we've been hacked again.
Merlin & Co is running our CEO search.
We've got a super simple promotion process, actually
It’s actually quite easy to remove - nobody wants the job!
Beats getting it in the back
This was Damocles' office.
HR says this will eliminate the need for a search committee.
You'll be in Damocles' old office.
Not only could he not remove the sword, but he had issues with the dagger in his back.
It comes right out, actually. But always tell the client how impressed you are.
It's a subtle reminder not to write captions for the New Yorker on company time.
It's a test from Corporate. Don't pull it out; just push it in further.
We've found it to be more effective than sexual harassment training.
No Arthur, this is Deskaliber.
This is why you have security escort them out.
Well, this is awkward. I meant to give you the axe.
Now you can live by the sword, die by the sword, email by the sword, make calls by the sword and enjoy the view by the sword.
The legend is that whoever releases the Sword of Mar-a-Lago from its mahogany prison shall be freed from all accountability forever.
Well, rumour has it the last person to pull it out fell on it at the end of the next quarter.
They say that whoever pulls the sword from the desk will be Trump's next cabinet appointee, so everyone's been avoiding it.
You'll be working the knight shift.
We need a wizard to turn this company around.
Pulling it out is only the beginning: you must also stab your partners in the back.
I'm not sure our anger management course is working.
We used to use Myers-Briggs; this test has a better track record.
He lived by the sword but was axed by the board.
For a CEO position, it's a very short interview process.
At the tip is the key to the executive washroom
Still beats the electoral college
Well at least we now know the sword is mightier than a particle board desk.
The Lady of the Lake will be out of the office till Tuesday.
The pen is mightier, but this is way more dramatic.
This is your new office. The last guy got the axe.
...and so Arthur, for your final test...
Arthur doesn’t believe in passwords.
IT’S EXCALIBUR ?? THAT’S hard to swallow.
Only the one true CEO can lead King Arthur Flour.
Do you have a pen?
So, this is Damocles' old office?
Well, I hope you weren't exaggerating in your resume.
Many have tried and many have failed. I’d recommend hand sanitizer.
A Post-It would’ve sufficed.
And he who removes the sword brings donuts on Tuesdays.
This is strange, I never noticed the flag on that building before.
Looks like it's come down to whoever has the most pull.
We’ve given up on finding a decent CEO. We’re looking for a king now.
You'll be on the knight shift.
They say if you can pull it out you can win the New Yorker cartoon caption contest.
Arthur, Arthur and Arthur will always be a family run law firm.
And here’s your office. The sword is built in, for when you need to fall on it.
He was a great boss, but never quite had what it took to be legendary.
This is in lieu of an interview. Give it a try.
Actually, ANYONE can pull it out. The challenge is to remove the inventory control tag without setting off the detector.
You have to have a lot of pull to get this office...
We thought so, too, but pulling on it just makes the building fart.
He just painted his face blue, yelled "freedom," and walked out.
We tried to tell him it wasn’t set in stone.
No one remembers the password.
I prefer the pen.
We said we were looking to hire high caliber people, Johnson, not Excalibur people.
Our headhunters wanted to try a more classical recruiting approach.
You could say it was a hostile takeover.
Phew. I thought the board would hire a hatchet man.
There's just one remaining step in the interview process.
Beats me. Let's ask Arthur.
It’s not a job it’s a calling.
Legend says he who removes it shall reign over all of New England Regional Marketing and Sales.
You said you were born for this job, now prove it.
They say it takes the strength of 1,500 average-salary employees to remove it.
Suddenly, the round table in the conference room makes a little more sense.
Don't tell me. The conference room has a round table.
Let the intern handle it.
They say only the true Vice President of Marketing Communications can remove it.
Makes as much sense as the Electoral College
HR says it'll eliminate the need for background checks.
Behold, Deskalibur!
If you move it the other way it locks the door.
It can only be picked up by a Republican with moral character ... it has been there since the end of the Reagan presidency ...
Bought the letter opener online, it looked smaller.
Welch couldn’t. Fiorina choked. Musk and Bezos failed. Get real, Artie. You work in the mail room.
No... it's just a letter opener.
I know the pen is mightier, but this makes a better point.
It makes a strong statement, but it's terrible ergonomically.
We've streamlined our pre employment screening.
Cake in the break room.
It’s just the best letter opener I’ve ever used. And it never gets lost!
I don’t care about being king or CEO or whatever, I just want that letter opener.
Just don't stick your neck out for anybody.
Many men have tried and failed to remove the sword from the desk. They each received generous severance packages.
Maybe we should just go with a recruiter.
Wouldn't it be easier for him to just leave the business to his son?
I’ve asked him to take a stab at new office decor.
I see your request for a new desk was denied.
And this is our cutting edge department
Ugh, I barely made it up the beanstalk in the last interview.
HR thought it up.
Deskcalibur.
Honestly, anything is better than the Electoral College.
I was actually stunned to find these desk accessories at IKEA.
Can we conclude he was wrong about being able to pardon himself?
The pen didn't stand a chance.
I told him the pen was mightier, but he still wanted the sword.
We haven’t had a CEO for a thousand years.
Melania must have been looking for Donald
Unfortunately, he didn’t have enough pull.
We’re Farmers, and we covered it.
The lady of the water cooler told me to check this out.
The last guy who had this office was a legend.
We've been hacked.
The last guy fell on it.
Who even uses landlines anymore?
No, its a just a handle that opens and closes the drapes.
Seems the sword is mightier after all.
Pull it out and the job is yours.
HR has really streamlined the hiring process.
On the plus side, we’ve been without a CEO for ages
I specifically requested a round table.
At least he didn't get the ax.
Wait till you see his pen.
He's downstairs leading a round-table discussion with some marketing wizards.
I mean, yeah, I knew he was mad, but sword-in-the-desk mad??
Here at Camelot Industries our interview process is a simple one.
It's a rigged test: There's no such thing as a CEO with a pure heart.
The culture here is somewhat passive-aggressive.
Whoever can pull it out will make 400 times what one of our workers makes.
Type in your username, pull the sword, and you're logged on.
We're looking for someone of a high calibur.
Again?! Get Arthur.
It's been like this ever since his genetic testing results came back.
Little Arthur, the messenger boy, is the only one who hasn't tried yet.
He gave his fortnight notice.
I knew buying that round table for the boardroom was a mistake.
Like I told you in the interview, we work knights.
If we’d ordered the regular size letter openers, this never would have happened.
I mean you can have a go, but frankly, the office next door is nicer.
It's not as difficult as mastering Excel.
The job posting says you're supposed to be good at leading round table discussions as well.
One day, a middle manager will come.
We’re going to need a rounder table.
Clearly it's still here, but if anyone asks, we're supposed to say, "it was the most tremendous thing, the only person to pull it out, very tremendous."
This explains the round table in the break room.
You can come out now sir ... he's gone.
He works the knight shift.
Our interview process is pretty simple, actually.
The pen lost.
Our ideal candidate is creative, driven, and a rightful leader.
He won't be hiding under his desk anymore.
We were really excited when we saw “known for persistence and problem solving” listed on your resume.
It's Warren Buffet's succession plan
Actually, Artie, I have a good feeling about your chances.
They said only the chosen one can remove the sword and become CEO. Rumor has it, the janitor pulled it out last night, but HR put it back and will not speak of the matter.
I thought he got the axe?
They call it "Deskcalibur."
It's just a formality, really.
The board is interviewing Arthur somebody for CEO. British, I believe.
I don't think he understood when I said "leave a message."
Drop it off at HR if you are the true VP of operations.
The culture here is a bit medieval.
Our CEO selection process is legendary.
You should see the corner office challenge.
HR has taken this new ‘roundtable’ initiative a little too far.
They must be looking for someone of a certain caliber.
We have really big envelopes here.
You just missed him, he's in a round table meeting till 10.
That's the thing about working for Merlin, he's kind of old school...
And as for this job, we have unfortunately been having trouble finding someone of just the right Excalibur.
I found a guy who can do it, but he wants a round table.
Just one more task and your promotion will be finalized.
Yes, I know it is rife with symbolism. Nontheless, I still think it's bad design.
Arthur took exception with the concept that the pen is mightier than the sword.
He'll be out for a while. Hernia surgery.
Three factor authentication sucks.
I see no CEO replacement has met the recruitment requirements
You have to admit, it's better than our current election process.
I told you it would be a hostile takeover.
He didn't say a word. Just showed everybody his winning lotto ticket, stuck that thing in his desk, and walked out the door!
And here is where the magic happens.
Arthur always has the coolest paperweights
Congratulations, you’ve reached the final stage in our interview process!
Corporate raiders, by the look of things.
This part of the interview will be a little more hands-on.
Our algorithm stripped the interview process down to the essentials.
I won't miss the drama.
Well, I guess it's down to the two of us, Artie.
This is the skill test for women candidates.
This is our CEO’s idea of a succession plan.
Oh gosh no. That just turns on the computer.
I think I've found Arthur's letter opener.
If ye can initiate a three-party conference call using that phone on the first try, the job shall be yours forever more.
Unfortunately, no, it isn't a metaphor.
And of course the Lady of the Lake would be your administrative assistant.
We don't give the corner office to just anybody.
Legend has it that the one who removes it gets 300 times more pay, a penthouse apartment, and a new desk.
He usually forgets his keys.
He left for more noble pursuits.
An MBA from Harvard is not enough to become CEO any more.
and I thought he got the axe.
Notice there is no pen.
Get Merlin from accounting. He'll get rid of this.
Go ahead, Art. Give it a try.
Did you see the 15 century gap in his resume? He said he was 'finding himself'.
The good news is that the spider is definitely dead...
Actually, it's just the light switch.
No Pressure.
There's just one last interview question...
Arthur said he had a new idea for choosing the next vice president.
Now do you understand the shape of the table in the board room?
They say only Robert Mueller can pull it out.
Looks like Arthur is getting the promotion.
Legend has it the True Leader of the Free World will pluck the sword free once the swamp is drained
It comes out easily, actually, but nobody wants the job.
Call IT. We’ve been hacked.
The search committee came up with another requirement.
The standards for promotion here are pretty competitive...
Do you think you have what it takes to work at Excalibur Investments?
We take the headhunting business seriously.
He thought it was a step up from ‘the buck stops here’.
Whoso pulleth out this sword from this desk . . . is still an exhausted and defeated middle-manager with little hope for real success or even appreciation.
I knew Medieval Mondays was a bad idea...
If you succeed, your next challenge will be pulling the cell phone from the intern’s hand.
No need for interviews—we’re looking for just the right person to run the King Arthur Flour Company.
Just try to leverage it.
I take it the Exit Interview did not go well
This isn't what I had in mind when I told you to stick it to the man
Don't worry, I have a pen.
This IS the interview.
He always said the pen was mightier than the sword.
Whoever pulls the sword from this desk also gets reserved parking.
Granted, it's a bit medieval, but selecting a CEO based on integrity hasn't exactly worked out.
So Arthur, this will be your new office.
We've had five applicants, and so far, five hernias.
Actually, it's the dimmer for the lamp.
It would appear the CEO position is still open.
No no no...HIGH caliber. I said I hope our new manager is HIGH caliber.
Looks like Mr. Zorro has stepped out for a sandwich.
I guess they finally pierced the corporate veil.
It's double-edged. Tough on hiring, but makes for quick work on exit interviews.
A job of mythic proportions.
Was that there when we left?
...I said we want higher CALIBER employees
The day he quit was legendary.
Bob, is this meeting set in stone?
Bet you it still goes to the boss's kid.
We had to find a way for the male executives to have a dick measuring contest without literally having a dick measuring contest.
Is this his way of telling us he wants a round table?
Finish this last part of the interview, and the job is yours.
you're lucky; most people don't have a phone.
Let's try some WD-40.
Whoso pulleth out this sword gets a key to the executive washroom.
Can I assume the conference room has a round table?
I guess Arthur quit.
She doesn't believe that nonsense about the pen.
It's pretty much what you think.
This brings us to the final part of our interview.
You know it's going to be a woman who pulls it out. Right?
For now, you’ll be in Mr. Damocles’ old office.
We never needed the pure-of-heart before.
I heard they were making cuts at the top.
Or bring in the head of Medusa and you can have the corner office.
It's password protected.
Since Dodd-Frank, we’ve been taking a fresh approach to executive promotions.
The last person behind this desk was a real legend.
Yes, you could say that the corporate takeover was hostile.
Is there any way this is good news?
If you can pull it out, you won't have to work here anymore.
In lieu of interviews, we're taking a different approach with all our job candidates.
You go ahead, my hernia's acting up.
It's a bit archaic, but it's a proven method
Even after a year President Trump still can't manage to budge it
At least I won't have that hanging over my head anymore.
...so did you get the spider?
It’s the new Excalibur mouse
Were thinking it makes as much sense as the Electoral College.
And this is the HR department.
At least we aren't getting the ax.
No, you pull it.
I heard the job is up for grabs.
We find this is a much faster hiring process
We can have our maintenance guy Arthur remove it for you.
This is why my wife tells me I can't work from home.
Wait, wrong office.
The CEO proposed it to the Board as his succession plan.
Believe it or not, it was a paper-cut that finally got him.
At least they didn´t give him the axe
The round table arrives next week.
A hernia took out the last CEO candidate.
He always leaves his desk so neat.
I guess he had more than an axe to grind.
You must be better liked, the previous general manager was stabbed in the back.
And he was afraid he'd get the axe....
Don’t get too excited. We just need you to fix the desk.
Your new office, where you'll be in charge of cost cutting.
This explains the round table in the conference room.
Yes, Arthur was forced to resign, but he had a damn good sense of humor.
Apparently there's been a hostile takeover.
I would try, but this isn't the kingdom I imagined.
Yeah, so now the sword is mightier.
After Brexit, no one has even tried pulling it out because no one wants to rule Britain.
The story of this company is the story of its dyslexic founder, Arthur King.
We're still waiting for the one true boss to appear.
...and worse yet, he's starting calling me Sancho.
Huge upset. The pen lost.
We've simplified our vetting process...
No, Ed, I said let’s bury the hatchet!
I see I need to have a talk with the person who prepared your office. I clearly said you were a lefty.
There was no chance for upward nobility.
He said something about meeting up with Guinevere for spin class and left.
Yes, you can stand on the desk...
Our last CEO was a legend.
And now for the final portion of your interview.
We do our hiring the old fashioned way
When I said take a stab at it I was speaking figuratively
Call Arthur, in accounting.
It hasn't been the same since the hostile takeover.
Well, at least he didn't get the axe.
The last guy got quite the severance
It's a letter opener, or it makes you King, not sure which.
That’s weird. The boss still has a land line on his desk.
We’re still waiting for the rightful heir to the company.
We have one more test before we can make you a job offer.
And then he got all medieval on me.
This gives new meaning to "severance pay," doesn't it?
People kept stealing the letter opener.
My pen fails to set the same tone.
He must get some very big envelopes.
No. You do not get to be CEO if you pull it out. Just the head of security.
Behold: the key to the executive bathroom.
It doesn't matter. He won the Electoral College.
Legend says that whoever pulls it out is the rightful CEO
See? And they won't let me have a plant in my office.
He was legendary.
Art took the day off to look for a round desk.
The prophecy speaks of the One True MBA.
And I was scared we’d get the axe.
The boss is obviously not about to fall on it any time soon.
I just know that it's a message, and it's not a good one.
HR is really having a tough time finding Arthur’s replacement
This was Damocles' office.
Should I look under the desk, or do you want to?
Now I understand why there's a round table in the conference room.
And now, for the final part of the interview
I’m guessing it was a hostile takeover.
And with your promotion, the excutive letter opener.
I hope this isn't what he meant by cutting edge...
You'll be taking Mr. Damocles old office.
Can you call Arthur from the mail room to get rid of that?
It's entry level, but you have to be the chosen one.
And here's the office of the once and future CEO.
"Pendragon's old school. He said the once and future head of HR will reveal himself".
Our hiring procedure is old school.
You have until the end of the day, then tomorrow you have to go and find the Golden Fleece.
Maybe the sword is mightier than the pen...
He always said he really would have preferred a round desk.
…and that’s when this gigantic turtle with a fucking bandana around its eyes, I shit you not, dropped from the ceiling and stabbed my desk. I seriously don’t even know how to begin filing the Facilities department work order.
Anyone could be our next CEO--it's not set in stone.
It’s all yours if you can pull it off.
The position comes with a title.
Huh. I thought he was getting axed.

And he was worried about getting the axe.
King Arthur abdicated once he realized there was more money in investment banking.
The Board has decided to choose the new CEO by using the Merlin method.
Oh My. And I thought ‘...,Die by the sword,’ was just metaphorical.
Seems like a lot of effort for a better parking space.
Last time he hides under his desk!
The way it usually goes around here is the someone who pulls it out uses it to stab someone else in the back.
This is why we tell you to turn on spell check.
It's not the executive search process I'd have picked either, but the Lady of the Lake is on the board.

Whosoever pulleth Excalibur from this desk shall be rightly named the next Regional Manager for Northeast Ohio.
They say the first person to remove the sword from the desk will wield unlimited inter-departmental power.
So now I know why the job's been open so long.
Wow...what happened to the old "pink slip"?
We have a very competitive severance package.
Don't get excited. It's just a tease. So far, everyone in middle-management has pulled it out.
I'm just glad it wasn't a typo after all - he honestly meant to threaten to leave a large sword on my desk and not a large "s-word."
We're looking for some one with an Ivy League MBA who is well versed in Arthurian legend.
Well, we have our answer.
Many have tried for the corner office, Mr. Arthur ...
Think of it as management's quest to avoid poring over a stack of resumes.
There it is, Floyd... draw the sword and we’ll finally vanquish the poor and defenseless.
This is the office of one of our retired partners.
Behold Excalibur! The sword of power! Forged when copiers and staplers and sticky notes were One with Man, and PowerPoint was but a dream!
It's for opening your really big envelopes.
big envelopes
No, it's not a challenge for new hires. The former CEO is under the desk.
Sure, you could pull it out, but then you'd have to be the new VP of Marketing AND King of England.
Jim, I thought we’ve gone over this. It’s the pen that’s mightier.
The lady from Lake Office Supplies stopped by.
Ah man, I told him he needed to get his desk SORTED.
This Disney merger has really been magical.
I look high and low for my letter opener, and - bam - there it is.

Merlin,can you join us in here?
He who removeth it shall... Ah to hell with it. You want the job or not?
Every new hire thinks they are the next Lancelot.

Is this how we're doing succession planning now?
We all chipped-in for the letter opener.
It’s just a formality.
It’s a sad and sworded story.
What do we put in the job posting?
Mr. Arthur had several unsubstantiated claims on his resume.
Arthur's thoughts on succession were very clear.
Unfortunately our policy with respect to medieval weapons was quite vague.
Wouldn’t it make more sense to use a search firm?
Our interview process is a bit unconventional.
This isn't even the half of it. Thursdays he shows up in a full suit of armor.
Maybe we'd be better off without a king.
So you'll be using Arthur's office for now....
Saves time in having to review resumes.
Is that an invitation to a quest or a hint of what’s to come?
But I don't want to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
He's on leave at present. Hernia operation.
Go get Arthur from accounting.
His business motto is the art of the steel.
He who can free the blade gets comprehensive health and ten vacation days.
I wonder how his exit interview went.
If you can remove it, you will unite the accounting department, and lead us to a strong fourth quarter.
You only get to be CEO.
Dave From Accounting and His Nights at the Square Table
You can come out now, Harold. You did NOT get the axe.

It was weird enough when our last boss ordered a stone desk.
So King Arthur just gave his two weeks notice
whoso pulleth out this sword of this desk is rightwise CEO born of the Company
This is nothing. Previously the CEO candidates had to perform the Twelve Labours of Hercules.
And this used to be Merlin’s office.
Does this mean I can have your old letter opener
I understand that the Executive Search Committee has decided to simplify the process
It's the new hiring process. Pull it out and you can skip the next three interviews.
'So you see, we've updated our selection process for the internship.'
Legend says, 'Whoso pulleth out this sword of this desk is rightwise king of the window office.'
That’s odd. I heard Bob got the ax.
It’s an unconventional way of choosing a CEO but give it a try.
If Human Resources doesn't find King Arthur soon, we will run out of desks.
The window office doesn't come easy.
We're going back to basics to choose the next CEO.
Legend has it that if you can pull the sword out from the desk, all your sexual harassment suits will be settled before going to court with no press.

Still, I kinda miss nepotism.
At least he left us with a succession plan.
I think they should go back to pink slips.
The pen has been trumped by the sword!
Did you call IT?
I thought they usually used an axe.
At King Arthur Flour we have a unique process for selecting a CEO.
Looks like he complained about the sushi again
He came, he worked, and i guess he conquered.
I was just hoping for the accounting position
Oh no, not again...
I did say that I was looking for a challenge.
Nobody expected the Spanish Inquisition.

The boss is a legend in his own mind.
Mr Damocles, it's time.
Once again. She missed the point.
I don't see the point.
...and they say he who pulls the sword will solve the production problems of the model 3
This interview round is going to have a practical component.
We had to design around it. Is it obvious?
Is your greed pure enough?
I know it's worked before, but isn't there a better way to find our next CEO.
This isn't what I meant when I said to leave honest feedback on my desk
we get the point
I guess Mitch is attending his anger management class today.
He only works knights.
If you don't get the sword, you get the axe instead.
No. He couldn't pull it out either. Now he's having an identity crisis.
Last guy walked out the door yelling "FREEDOM."
It doesn't mean a thing, just the usual office politics around here.
This isn't a job interview per se.
Arthur is out to lunch.
Who keeps a letter opener in their desk anymore?
Actually, legal says we can’t call it Excalibur, so Pointy McPointface, it is.

The last letter he opened made him angry"
Last week, Jerry got the ax.
Wait till you see the executive washroom.
Damocles had this office before you.
Welcome aboard, Arthur, and be glad your name's not Damocles.
Oh, he was pretty good. But a legend? No. Not quite a legend.
The new FBI Director will have special powers.
He fired Damocles.
The latest and best letter opener.
All of our promotions are merit based.
Looks like the hostile takeover won.
His wife has terrible temper.
Let me guess. This was Arthur's old office?
I wonder if that new guy, Arthur, knows about this.
Millenials. Go figure.
You have a better chance getting the sword out, than winning the New Yorker Caption Contest

I already called building maintenance, they're sending up that new guy, Artie

He was supposed to fall on it.
This time, the pen lost.
I knew I should have worked from home today.
Looks like the top job is up for grabs.

Things just haven't been the same around here since Billy was found sleeping under his desk.
Looks like HR has posted another job opening.
What makes you so sure the takeover will be hostile?
We call it Excelcalibur
It's been there since the Kennedy administration.
Our succession plan is a bit medieval.
Yeah, it’s solid. It was imported from China just in time.
I've really had it...
HR isn't completely on board with this new hiring strategy.
To be fair, he was always telling us to work to the hilt.
I think it got him in the . . . . the particulars.
It's an old-fashioned hostile takeover.
No one has been able to pull it out, so it looks like we'll have to hire an executive serach firm after all.
A rather aggressive form of hacking, no?
And finally the office of the Once and Future CEO
'I was kinda expecting a note of some sort.'
I’m just glad it’s not a pen.
Me? Gosh no. I've never tried. I'm afraid of failure.
His tenure was one brief, shining moment.
Poor Bob. He kept saying a Sword of Damocles hanging over him, but no one took it seriously.
Do you have what it takes to be the Once and Future Accountant?
Looks like the corporate pirates made a visit.
It's mightier than the pen, AND the table.

Honestly, he tries every day. Now, he blames IT.
We work knights around here.
I know he didn't like the desk, but did he have to kill it?
It's easy to remove the sword. It's just that nobody wants to be king of Sears.

We still need to clean out the previous occupant’s effects..er..stuff.
And, now we come to the final stage of the interview process.
It was Pam, from accounting, with the sword in the board room.

If she can do it, it breaks the glass ceiling.
He dared to ask for a raise
The sword in the desk just doesn't have the same ring to it.

The only risk is whoever succeeds could be an unqualified, inexperienced lunatic.
It was easy. It's an IKEA desk.
She's downtown, waiting for the prints to arrive.
I suspect Viviane from personnel put it there.
Tell Arthur we are running out of time.
When they offered me the position, I said I'd take a stab at it.
Well Arthur it appears the job is yours
They're making it harder and harder to get a promotion these days.

Only a woman can save us now.
Hackers.
I meant I wanted a tribute to Dr. King, Arthur.

Someone mentioned succession planning. The next day this appeared.
One more little HR formality, Artie, and the job is yours.
We’re only accepting applicants named Arthur
He's a bit old school in that he still thinks the sword is mightier than the pen
It's an archaic way to choose our sales manager, Arthur, but we've been able to completely eliminate the Personnel Department.
Dangit, he left his desk light on again.
It's not a clever metaphor.
Did you say your name was Arthur?
That old guy Merlin from maintenance told me to come up here and give it a pull.

Legend? No, one of the interns got drunk at Bill's retirement party and now we can't get it out
I guess the rumor about a hostile takeover is true!
I heard his stress ball broke
Oh, and try not to hit the chair's 'raise' lever.
He leaves it like that when he goes to the men's room.
Whoso pulleth the sword must repaireth the hole in the desk.
He told me to take a stab at the problem - so I did.
All he said was 'I'm sick of this desk, I want a round table'
I guess this explains why he didn't set an out out office reply.
He seemed to go from high caliber to Excalibur over night.

This is the last step in the selection process.
HR has taken the interview process to a whole new level.
And this is where we keep the Executive Letter Opener.
Clearly #metoo again.
I think Arthur is taking the CEO selection far too seriously.
It’s not even a round table.
These Google interviews are getting more and more ridiculous
Pull this off, and the corner office is yours.
Ah. I see he's been served.
If the job was any good, they would have put it in a stone.

Clearly a message from the higher-ups.
As you can see, it was a hostile takeover.
These new login password requirements are getting ridiculous.
Man, these password security challenges are getting really tough.
We prefer a different approach to interviewing here at King Arthur Flour.
Have Human Resources lower the bar or we won't fill this spot in our lifetime.
Good thing that Damocles called in sick today.
I guess Arthur wasn’t ready for such a big career change
We could ship it to England, but they would charge us 25% tariff for the steel .

Arthur has such a ridiculous letter opener.
The pen lost.
HR is having trouble finding the right person for the job. So they're giving this a whirl.
I guess the pen isn't always mightier...
Lance, I like you a lot, but don't get any ideas.
this makes hiring the next CEO a little more interesting.
We asked Arthur to clean his desk when he retired, but he said "not my job anymore."

Do you think he is upset for being fired.
He was right. It does stop here.

It's been there for ages. Apparently 'pure of heart' and 'CEO' are mutually exclusive.
You are correct sir. That is an odd place for a flag.
Paperless business solutions, are never dull.
I think this is Arthur's resignation.
The search firm recommended it.
the desk had it coming.
That's some resignation!
I guess it's worth a try.
Last time he was here, he left a silver bullet.
So here is the last step in your job interview.
Try doing THAT with a pen!

His pen wasn't mightier.
How will the ploughshareholders feel about this?
Better call Artie from Accounting.
I trust you'll find your new office has everything you need, Arthur.
Arthur, you just need to do one thing and the CEO position is yours.
It was one my more difficult exit interviews.
I guess he's really upset by the Russian question.
We discourage napping.

For this position, we will ignore the conventional job interview process.

He fell under his sword.
He could have ruled this company, if he hadn't been napping under his desk at the time.

Tech support says it's a hardware issue.
We expect you will be of higher calibur than your predecessor.
There's also a lovely lake nearby the secretaries take their lunch at.

but we just ate Arthur...
We've narrowed the number of candidates down to you and one other applicant.
This promotion is epic.
That's the letter opener. You don't even want to see the pen and pencil set.
The trick is paying minimum wage employees to pull it out, then taking all the credit and the promotion.
This is the CEOs succession plan.
Can your pen do that.
So you want to run this place someday, huh?
Who should we contact first: the S.E.C, H.R., or Merlin?
Give it a try, but you should know a dragon ate our last three CEOs.
We'd like you to take a stab at the final interview challenge.
It's our new interview process!

This was easier than having an HR department

Is it just me, or has our company become a little too passive-aggressive?
I know it's a medieval way of doing things, but it avoids any need for an electoral college.
It's always been a point of pride to him that flattery never got Damocles a window office.
As yet, no one has accepted his challenge.

It's called Deskcalibur.
It's part of a company-wide initiative to encourage standing.

We're still looking for the one true CEO.

This was Arthur's office, he couldn't handle the knight shifts.
Well Ivanhoe said he wanted a shredder.
The legend is, whoever can remove that sword is our rightful CEO.
`…or if a black woman pulls it out she'll get our sincere thanks and a gift bag.'

No symbolism. Your predecessor tried to steal the desk.
I never can remember the past tense of smite.
It's the latest innovation in buget cuts.
And here, Mr. Arthur, is the final exam in our interview process.
We'll of course have that removed before you start work.
Well, that seems like an arbitrary method for electing a CEO...
Arthur's desk. He's our legendary leader.
That's the second thing I wanna yank on today.
Go get Galahad and Lancelot from maintenance. The boss is at it again.

I guess someone should tell Damocles that it’s safe to come back in.
Well, Arthur, maybe you are in line for a promotion after all.
That's the problem when your CEO is named Arthur King.
Meanwhile, we still await our Burger King.
I think Lehman tried something like this in 2007.
It shortens the interview process
Whoever removes it gets a lifetime of paperwork

Someone needs to call Merlin in HR.
Whoever takes a stab at that job had better be of the highest executive caliber.
Lookin' real sharp boss.
She makes a strong point.
It's better than receiving the ax
This certainly complicates our corporate succession planning.
We find that the test is more reliable than a CEO interview.
Someone found out where he napped.
I told Damocles it was a bad idea.
We're just lucky we didn't give him a pen.
This job isn't brain surgery.
You'll be using Pendragon's old office
I guess we'll see who really is destined for middle management.

Is that the desk from Caption Contest #498?!
I see someone has already claimed the office

Our board is legendary.
Arthur has left the building.
So what you’re saying is that if I pull the sword from the desk, I’ll become the CEO of this law firm?

This is why we have a strict "no eating at your desk" policy. Lacerated his inner thigh trying to butter a croissant.
Legend has it that it can only be pulled out by the one true CEO...
Must have been a big envelope.
And then I told HR that my name is Arthur King and they sent me up here.
Johnson always seems a little insecure. That's his letter opener.

We’re looking for someone with a certain je ne sais quoi.
The office safety video implies that we should bend our knees when lifting the sword.

Congratulations Mr. Arthur. Merlin, Lefey, Morgana and Associates are happy to have you aboard
It's a period piece.
This was Damocles' office... We should probably move on.

We’ve decided to simplify our interview process.
Our company offers generous, fate-based opportunities for advancement you won't find most other places.
So this is what the Brittish headhunter came up with?
This was Arthur King's desk. He took it a little too far.
The story is that the Lady of the Lake held aloft that very sword and... yeah, I rolled my eyes when I heard it too.
Well, Arthur, everyone in the office seems to think you have a good chance.
Apparently, the pen is mightier than the sword is fake news.
I don't know, but it can't be good
Now to the second phase of the interview.
I think Arthur is obsessed with Game of Thrones.
Et tu, IT guy.
He never was very tactful.
And this is our once and future CEO office ...
Arthur, before you try to remove it I have to ask you something. Are you married?
You try, I'm happy in accounting.
It's a new idea from Merlin in Human Resources.
Let the women try.
I wish they'd just let the Board choose a CEO.
His career has been legendary.
Legend has it, whoever pulls it out is CEO.
Apparently, he was upset because his desk was supposed to be round
If that thing gets in your way, just pull it out, Art.
I told you the Lady in the Lake was the wrong token female to put on the Board.
Bring that intern Arthur in here.
This office is Arthur's, the once-and-future accountant.
And this office only is used for the knight shift.
The position’s been empty for a while.
Arthur, this is why I brought you.
Excalibur Industries takes it leadership role seriously.
Even getting axed is classier in the c-suite.
So do I get a promotion if I pull it out or what?
Did you try just pulling it out?
Should we call Arthur in accounting?
Pull this sword from thy desk and the sword shall be thine - and we'll replace the desk.
No Mr President, I don't think Mr Obama is living under your desk.
My name is Arthur. I got this!

He who can remove the sword shall rule the Accounting Department.
In the off-season, she slays dragons and corporate raiders.
Remove the sword and the job is yours.
We have finally settled on a plan for CEO succession.
I take it the Old Man didn't name a successor.
That’s nothing. Just wait until the second round of interviews.
It's written that whoever removes the sword becomes the next CEO.
Well yes, here at King Arthur Flour promotions are handled in a rather old fashioned way.
- Donald 's such a show-off, look at the size of his letter opener - Yeah, Inferiority complex ! - Have you seen my new watch ?
I told you this was the beginning of a hostile takeover.
Arthur is on medical leave. You can use his office for now.
He left a note saying he had gone long on plow shares, made a killing, and was quitting.
And if you can pull that out, you can move the desk up to an office on six.
I'd call this a hostile takeover.
I guess this means we can take the day off.
So apparently, whoever pulls it out gets Steve's old job in accounting. Not sure why I bothered updating my resume.
there is a sword stuck in the bosses's desk Steve.
We're making some cuts around the office.
Forget about the sword. If you can get Trump out of the Russia mess, you're hired.
So far, none of the candidates were able to remove the sword.
Our hiring qualifications are a bit... unusal.
Well it is cheaper than paying severance
We had a new recruit in last week but she declined to use this office. Opted for full dental coverage instead.
It's a much easier hiring process.
Boss says whoever pulls it out is next in line to be CEO
You should see the boardroom table...
He only works knights.
Yes, it is a fairytale office.
They misunderstood when I said I was a night person.
It's really a cutthroat industry.
I guess the anger management classes aren’ t helping.
We couldn't find a stone. And now we can't get it out.
Like I told you, he said the sword stops here.
The quants say this is the best way to choose the next manager of our Roundtable Fund.
Learn from my mistake and skip the "Deskalibur" joke.
Yeah, you could probably muscle it out of there, but do you really WANT that job?
Sir, you can come out from under the desk now, she went back to her apartment.
They missed
This is how the Lady of the Steno Pool picks the next CEO.
Maybe if Merlin appears, I'll find out why I didn't get that promotion
One of is could be President.
That’s funny. Wednesdays are sword days.
Of course I can, but why would I want to?
If you can pull it out, the job's yours. But any repairs will have to come out of your budget.
Well, Damocles, now that it's fallen she's all yours.
Delusions of grandeur are not uncommon among CEOs.
Boss said if I can remove it I become CEO, but he also said not to touch it...
A simple memo greenlighting the "Sword and the Stone" remake would have been sufficient.
Whoa Bob, love how you've redecorated.
So that's the new way to hold a election in this Country.
They seem to be getting mightier lately
And I thought getting the axe would have been rough.
If you can pull it out, the corner office is yours.
We may need Arthur to get this removed, again.
Latest HR interview protocol...cutting edge....go on give it a pull.
Last week it was a gauntlet- and now this.
Man #1: "You pull it" Man #2: "No, no you pull it" Man #1: "No, you pull it, I don't want the responsibility"
Will he be in tomorrow do you think?
After being forced to remove the glass ceilings, we had to get creative.
Now I understand why he insisted on a round table in the conference room.
Whoever pulls the sword is allowed to skip the Christmas party.
If Arthur wants his old office back, he’s going to have to really earn it this time!”
The job's more or less yours but out of formality...
The owner's son just pretends the sword isn't there.
We decided to switch things up a bit and change casual Friday's into Camelot Friday's
This was going to be Jared's office.
And one more word of advice, never fall asleep at your desk.
Don't worry, Merlin knows a guy
I ordered a calendar not Excalibur!
Is that a thing? Hyperbole you can see?
There's plenty of room for upward nobility.
Before the board votes on your idea of switching to a round conference table, there's something they need you to do...
Maybe we shouldn't have said he couldn't cut it.
He read about it in "CEO for Dummies".
The executive search committee is old school.
You meet the new head of IT? I hear it's some guy named Merlin.
OK Lance, let's see what you can do with Deskalibur.
Our last manager had some strongly held opinions on the pen being mightier than the sword.
I hope George dosen't still take his afternoon naps under his desk.
Need I remind you not to touch his stuff?!
I know a woman who could totally deal with this, but they’re holding out for a certain kind of guy.
If you can get it out, the job is yours.
Go ahead give it a try. The board want somebody with mythical powers to replace the last CEO.
And that's just his letter opener!
That new search firm we hired, Excalibur, insists that this is the best way to select a new CEO.
See! The sword is mightier than the pen
Damocles was here a few minutes ago.
It's a corner office, but the letter opener is a bit of a challenge.
AI,crap, just pull out the damn sword.
When he got too frustrated he became president instead.
Whoever can pull it out becomes CEO.
Who moved the desk?
AND THIS IS THE HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE AT AVALON ENTERPRISES.
No, I asked if you don't mind working "KNIGHTS."
My understanding is that he got the idea from his succession planner.
And here's where we're trying a little experiment to select our next CEO.
With it comes unimaginable power...and an indictment.
So, if you pull that bad boy out, does that make you CEO?
So consequently we haven't had a CEO now for nearly 10 years
Unconventional vetting? Maybe, but solidly myth-based
HR said its the fairest way
We don't do golden parachutes -- we're old school.
Whoever pulls it out gets a $117 million severance package.
Just their way of saying you’ll have to work nights.
That's a huge letter opener.
...these days the pen is not always mightier
how deep are the cuts again?
Our accounting division is epic.
Can I get curtains if I pull the sword out?
The Board is really taking this 'kingmaker' thing too far.
He's no King Arthur.
I guess we can assume that the severance package was acceptable.
It's part of the screening process for new hires.
If we only we had a name for it.
We should schedule a round table discussion to address this.
What? He didn't get the "pen is mightier than the sword" memo?
We have a different approach when selecting a CEO.
Mr. Morgenstien is more of a, "sword mightier than the pen" type of guy.
They said it was "slightly used."
I heard the new CEOs name is Arthur.
Her leadership style is positively medieval.
The secret is to jiggle it.
Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise regional office manager from nine to five
It beats cleaning out the stables again.
She hates red tape
There’s a message here.
I'm telling you, this promotion is a double-edged sword.
Somc days he's King Arthur, other days King Lear
"Wart," you say?
No one likes the knight shift.
So, we are going this route instead of ziprecruiter?
Pull it out and you got the job.
It's the last remnant of the hostile takeover.
Since Art died, we haven't found anyone who can replace him.
He couldn't pull the sword so he got the axe!
Has HR advertised the job?
So,, the rumors are true—we’ve been acquired.
and all I did was miss a deadline.
I am having serious doubts whether the pen is mightier than the sword.
This is where the recent corporate cuts all started!
The hardest part was getting the license.
Merlin in I.T. says it has biometric ID, so we shouldn't even try to remove it.
Somebody go find Arthur in accounting
We find that asking candidates for their accomplishments, education, and processing background checks is inferior to the Excalibur challenge.
Hey, Arthur? Can you come in here, please?
Artie in accounting was able to do it, but then I fired him.
Well it's better than the electoral college.
The third round interviews are a little tougher for this one.
And this is where we keep our glass ceiling.
he's off on one of his crusades again
And this is Arthur's office.
So far, withdrawals have been impossible.
Whoever pulls it out gets to go back in time and unsend any email.
Phew. I thought he was axed.
For the last time, my name is Artie not Arthur.
It's a new interviewing trend; it was started by the same guy behind the whole round table thing.
The voicemail said we’ll find the Brexit tax plan on his desk.
Now do you believe me about the size of his letter opener?
This new instant messaging system really gets your attention
Well....the Electorial College didn't work....
Keep it to yourself, I did pull the sword out, but when I learned the reward, I put it back.
We haven't had a CEO since Arthur died.
When he said he would have to cut one of us, I didn’t think he meant literally.
It's been an HR nightmare.
It'll be ages till we find a replacement for Sir Bob in accounting.
He ran through too many assistants.
He was high caliber, but now he's excalibur.
I guess we ought to rethink the might of the pen.
Now John, this is the final step in your interview process.
So this is where the corporate ladder ends.
Look — it’s a family company, the boss’ kid is named Arthur, and it’s just a whole big thing.
I keep trying to get him to update his software, but he says he's comfortable with Excalibur.
It started with a sewer safari for alligators and now it's this Holy Grail thing. I'm telling you these testosterone supplements are dangerous.
Most people just use a paper weight.
It looks like the pen is taking a back seat in this one.
It's the perfect office for working knights and weekends.
No one has wanted to try removing it. The last CEO is serving a 15-month sentence.
He who successfully pulls the sword, leads the round table of middle-management.
Our last CEO wasn't of the highest caliber.
This process for selecting a new CEO is positively medieval.
Our leadership succession plan is legendary.
I told you the Board of Directors was looking for the Holy Grail.
I think his point was to resign.
We still haven't filled the position...HR is looking for the holy grail.
I told you he wasn’t axed
... and now for the final part of your interview ...
Could been worse - last guy got axed.
Looks like King Arthur prefers round tables.
Arthur was the best, but nothing's set in stone.
The legend goes anyone that anyone that can pull it out gets this office, a promotion, keys to the executive lounge, and a gold crown.
So that's probably the last time we'll do Bring Your Aggression to Work Day.
The things we have to do around here to get a promotion.
Is Arthur still in accounting?
Maybe we should have just given him a paper weight.
I hear it’s the company’s new way to select senior partners.
This our head hunter's response to our request for a high caliber executive.
And if you can pull the sword from the desk, the Knight account is yours.
Bob gets a little melodramatic during Game of Thrones season.
Perhaps we should transfer him to the knight shift.
Don't we have an Arthur King in the mail room?
And the legend sayeth, ‘He that pulls the sword from the desk shall have bestowed upon him this corner office and be rewarded the key to the Executive Washroom.’
He who can pull the sword from the desk is destined to receive a slightly damaged desk.
Have at it, but the title doesn't come with a pay raise.
Ahh and this brings us the desk of the Excelibur...
we've saved a lot on executive searches.
Seems like a medieval way of choosing the next CEO.
So...don't hide under your desk.
Executives who pull it out get what they deserve.
What do you think it means, Artie?
Even the sword makes double our salaries
Behold, Exec-Caliber!
It's his line in the desk.
Arthur was upset this wasn't a round table.
Get me somebody who doesnt believe in trickle down economics and kmows Arthuroian legend.
He said a guy named Arthur would come by to pick it up.
If you can remove the sword, you get health insurance.
We're looking for "Exec-caliber"
And this USED to be Arthur's desk...
Guinevere, in housekeeping, is taking care of it.
Ya'know I have a feeling we're in the wrong office.
His note said WWKAD? (what would King Arthur do)
Final test ... and the job is yours.
Pen conquers sword; sword conquers desk.
Budget cuts were especially brutal this year.
Pull it out, Artie, and the chair is yours.
This is your new office. The last guy had some problems . We attempted to bury the hatchet but he apparently was confused.
Which one of you is Arthur?
The HR department has really gone downhill since Margaret left.
Well at least it’s not in your back
Your resume said "proficient in M-Sword?"
Art doesn't like it when people nap down there.
Our new CEO selection process is epic.
Quick, pull it out before Trump gets here.
They say if you successfully pull the sword, you get a $5 gift card to Arby’s.
At least we don't have to pull his finger.
As you can see, Camelot.com is looking for a new CEO
We call her Faxcalibur.
After a few months here, Amazon is going to seem cushy.
I told you not to reheat fish in the office microwave
If you can get it out you’ll get to be the new CEO. Otherwise try not to cut the cord when you answer the phone.
Do you know how many pencil sharpeners end up in the ocean every year?
No one name's their kid Arthur anymore...
Arthur, he does as he pleases.
Too heavy-handed for my taste. Do you have something in a light saber?
Looks like the boss is at his roundtable.
I guess drawing the sword from the desk means your skilled enough to stab someone in the back
Sir, there was a spider.
Well on the bright side, it could have been the $45,000 dining room table.
Your predecessor had no pull, here.
The cutbacks around here are quite...literal.
Talk about killing the messenger.
That reminds me. I have tickets to Spamalot next week.
ya we need a union
Arthur's coming back, right?
This is a job for a woman
Trust me, if someone pulls it out, it's no Camelot.
Our interview process is a bit unconventional.
The job posting says there’s a preferred candidate.
Even the restroom is a challenge. How are your arcane riddle skills, Dale?
They kept saying winter was coming, but this is ridiculous.
It’s more important that we find the right person rather than just filling a desk.
This hasn't been an easy position to fill, as you might imagine.
I miss the old IT guy
But what if i dont want to work for Scott Pruitt ??
A word of advice. Forget about the legend thing. Just be careful of your knees.
Honestly, King of the Britons is a step down from CEO.
Welcome to medieval management, Baxter.
Rumor is a man dressed in armor barged into the office and said, "A Lannister always pays his debt." That's when Manafort ran out screaming like a baby.
A bit of a twist: whoever can push it in gets to retire.
So this would be your office as the once and future comptroller.
Arthur must be out today.
I don't think I want the job.
The available corner office comes with the Gordian Knot, you can take your pick.
I guess it's safe to say he didn't get axed.
Only now will we see if you are the true heir to the sales region.
Well, what do we do now? All the white guys have tried!
In the interest of full disclosure, I should tell you there's a strong internal candidate.
Pull out the sword and we'll put you in charge of our division of weird stuff.
So, here is our newest pitch for replacing the Electoral College.
Just one more thing then you'll be the new CEO of King Arthur Flour.
Well, we were hoping for a different sort of tax cut.
I heard it even comes with dental.

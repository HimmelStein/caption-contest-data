How do you respond to allegations that you're bipolar?
The poles show you’re in trouble.
I'm sure voters have noticed that you're completely in the dark half the time.
I guarantee in twelve hours we'll see a completely different side of my opponent.
Ask yourself, are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?
Oh, sure. But in 12 hours, you'll take the opposite position.
I guarantee in twelve hours my opponent will be on the other side of the issue.
That wasn’t your position this morning.
My opponent, on the other hand, tends to be all over the map.
There you go again; constantly changing your position"
Ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4.54 billion years ago?
Spin. Spin. Spin. That's all we ever get from you.
Spin and more spin!  That's all we get from you.
Everything doesn’t revolve around you, you know!
Wait, if you're here, then where are we?
And finally, can you really trust my opponent whose position changes EVERY SINGLE DAY?
Twelve hours from now my opponent will do a complete about-face.
And yet just a few hours ago you held a totally different position!
Don't be fooled by her 4.5 billion years of experience.
Please let me finish. Not everything revolves around you!
I know for a fact Russia is behind this.
No offense, but half the time , you’re in the dark!
We've had enough of your spin.
Clearly Russia is behind you!
In the past 12 hours, my opponent has made a complete about-face.
Spin! All we get from you is spin!
Make no mistake—in just half a day his position will have changed 180 degrees!
My opponent changes his position every day
And can we trust a candidate that does a 180 twice a day?
My opponent’s position changes every day!
All my opponent ever does is spin, spin, spin.”
Folks, we need stability—not a revolution every 24 hours.
With all due respect, I am the one with the degree in global studies.
Wait... If you're here then where am I?
I don't care how many millions of years it took. Your 5 minutes are up.
Oh, I get it - the whole world's right and I'm wrong.
Really? You held the exact opposite position just six months ago!
You are bipolar and tempestuous.
I've got many, many continents. More continents than you can even imagine. The best continents.
Even your own poles show you losing.
Spin, spin and more spin!  Stop that!
Please let me finish. Your last turn felt like it took all day.
If you're here then what am I standing on?
And another thing, you think the sun rises and sets around you!
You're in trouble at the poles!
Just as we seemed to finding some common ground, you rotate right back to the same position you held 24 hours ago!
Unfortunately, Wind and Fire will be unable to join us tonight.
Just in the last day, my opponent has rotated 360 degrees.
Yes, but can you act locally?
Rest assured, by the time this debate is over, my opponent will have changed positions yet again.
The only thing we have to fear is sphere itself.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is me against the world.
First you spend millions of years making fossil fuels, now you say we can't use them?
There you go again, thinking everything revolves around you!
Unlike my opponent, I don’t believe everything revolves around me.
Are you better off than you were four billion years ago?
My opponent believes the sun rises and sets on her.
Not quite. But you're getting warmer.
Look, if you are who you say you are then what am I standing on?
Don't be intimidated by the gravity of my opponent.
Nothing but spin.
Enough with the spin.
Are we really considering electing someone who will be over five billion years old at the time they take office?
This debate doesn't revolve around you.
There you go again, promising the moon.
It’s always about you, isn’t it?
It's all spin.
My opponent relies too heavily on poles.
I knew Venus. Venus was a friend of mine. And you, sir, are no Venus.
My opponent here is a master of spin.
My opponent spins everything.
The earth has an announcement to make: it's bi-polar.
She keeps going around and around and never gets to her point.
Half of each and every day, my opponent is operating in the dark.
Sure, my opponent claims she can provide clean air, clean water, enough food for everyone - but how is she going to pay for it?
My opponent has been spinning in circles. If we follow her we'll just end up in the same spot next year!
It appears my opponent is getting heated.
You can spin all you want
Save the Earth? Now who's the narcissist?
So, if you are here, what are we all standing on?
As always, my opponent is going around in circles.
Yeah, and I guess you think the sun revolves around you!
Is my opponent going to reach a point or continue to go around in circles?
And the moon is gonna pay for it.
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation!
It is common knowledge that my opponent is a master of spin
I'm afraid your time's almost up.
It is almost impossible to overstate the gravity of my opponent’s position.
Can you be a bit more Pacific?
That wasn’t your position six months ago!
A stay-at-home mom for 4 1/2 billion years with no managerial expertise...
Well, I'm just warming up, too.
No!  I say that you have been given too much latitude already!
As you can see, my opponent is completely off his axis!
What makes you an expert on climate change?
Could you be more Pacific?!
I think you need a latitude adjustment.
Yes, my opponent may be worldly, but he also has a dark side.
You just have to put a spin on everything, don't you?
My opponent is only showing half of the picture!
Furthermore, Fox just broke the story that you weren't even born in our solar system!
If elected, I will build a great, great wall and Mars will pay for it.
Our next auction item, one used and abused planet. A real fixer upper, but with lots of potential.
As you can see the world is very big. Huge. Really huge. And there is a lot of water. Very wet water.
You don't look so hot to me.
I've seen Jupiter, sir. And you're no Jupiter.
My opponent seems to think the world of himself
There you go again... Spin. Spin. Spin.
You too have faults.
I will concede that my opponent speaks with exceptional gravity.
The Flat Earth Society welcomes a very controversial speaker tonight...
And yet my opponent refuses to share her earth certificate!
I will concede that my opponent may have more gravitas.
In case you haven't heard--you are not the center of the universe.
In general, we at the Flat Earth Society do not lend much credibility to physical evidence.
You're constantly shifting your position.
My opponent is a known environmental extremist.
If you're here, then where are we?
Please, stop saying "I think I 'm speaking for all of us..."
You think everything revolves around you.
My opponent is a disaster waiting to happen.
Proving, once again, it's me against the world.
My opponent, clearly, thinks the world of himself.
Are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?
Could you be a bit more Pacific?
That's your best argument?  You have 4.5 billion years of life experience over me?
No doubt my opponent will defend globalism.
Can I finish my point? You had 4.5 billion years to make yours.
Wait... if you're here, then what planet am I on?
And what makes YOU an expert on climate change?
OK, so maybe when I said I would "take on the world" I overpromised.
It isn't fair. You've been warming up for a while.
 I'm just getting started.
Point to where the orange man hurt you.
I knew Jupiter; I was a friend of Jupiter, and sir, you are no Jupiter.
I'm for the voters while my opponent is for self-preservation.
Well, it looks like the whole world is against me.
I catch your continental drift.
And you, sir, are no Mars.
I knew planet Earth, you sir are no planet Earth.
I would ask my opponent to please refrain from finishing every argument with "the world has spoken".
When I said I’m willing to take on the whole world, it was a metaphor!
My opponent is all over the map.
And now, someone who needs no introduction.
Global warming, world peace, global poverty"...For my opponent it's always, "Me, me, me!
I would suggest to you that you are taking these climate change debates far too personally
Do you even understand the gravity of this situation?
I give facts and all you get from her is spin.
Oh, believe me. I'm just warming up, too!
My opponant can spin as much as he likes but we all know that in 24 hours he will return to exactly the same position. Just admit it sir; you are a globalist!
You're clearly out of your orbit.
Stop spinning and give me a straight answer!
No, I'm the one who's just warming up.
It's me against the world.
So after Atlas shrugged, what happened?
That's not exactly what I meant, but you're getting warmer.
Please give a not-so-warm welcome to our next guest.
My opponent is ignoring the gravity of this situation.
Why does it always feel like it's me against the world?
So I guess it's me against the world.
Doug mansplains climate change to Mother Earth
Well, I guess it's me against the world, then!
You see, the whole world is against me.
My opponent is a master at spinning.
And what makes you the expert on global warming?
You always have to turn everything into a global issue, don’t you?
Stop spinning everything.
You thought you were too big to fail.
You need to cool down before we continue.
Wait ... if you’re there, where am I?
I can see Alaska from here!
My five minutes are up. I'm sure my opponent could go on for ages.
My opponent, however, leans twenty three and a half degrees to the left but six months later will do exactly the opposire!
Just cool down.
All my opponent does is spin.
Enough about your problems.
My opponent has 'flatly refused' and now he 'roundly condemns' - well, which is it?
Oh, sure...next you'll be saying you speak for everyone.
May I present, the leading authority on climate change.
Once again, my opponent proves the master of spin.
What if I’m right and the whole world IS wrong?
Let me finish...you've had 4.5 billion years; it's my turn to talk.
What on earth are you talking about?
With all due respect, the people are getting sick of your constant spin.
My opponent would have you believe that a crisis is looming...
My opponent obviously thinks the world of himself.
There you go again, always spinning things!
Who cares what the world thinks!
The universe does not revolve around you!
Must you put a spin on everything?
My opponent seems to think the sun rises and sets on her alone!
Is it warm in here or is it just you?
My opponent thinks everything revolves around her.
Please - you've had 5 billion years; you can wait another 30 seconds.
I don't think my opponent appreciates the gravity of the situation.
Sir, could you be more pacific?
I told you I’m not paranoid..the world IS against me
My opponent will promise you the moon.
I know you’re just warming up
And now, introducing my special guest for Earth Day...
You say you want a revolution?
My opponent’s arguments are just all over the map.
You're not too big to fail.
I don't care for my opponent's spin.
Too big to fail? Tell that to Venus.
Quit with the spin!
Nothing but spin, folks!
Must you spin everything?
This is big, no matter how you spin it.
Our next presenter has tremendous gravitas.
And our next expert on climate change needs no introduction...
Volatile. Windy. Erupting. Stormy. These are all words commonly used to describe my opponent.
Spin, spin, spin, that’s all you do!
You clearly fail to understand the gravity of the situation.
71% of my opponent's surface is covered with water. He is practically all wet. He is 4.54 billion years old! He takes 24 hours to rotate on his axis! Let's not even mention the gaping hole in his ozone layer. vote for me.
Of course my opponent promises you the world. But does he have anything else to offer?
The earth was captured by the sun.  I like planets that were not captured by the sun!
You're just mad because you're melting in the polls.
And our next Earth Day speaker needs no introduction.
Everyday her position changes, like 180 degrees.
I don't care how many revolutions you've started. You have to wait your turn.
Are you going to answer the question, or just keep spinning?
So if YOU'RE here, then what planet am I on?
My opponent expects everything to revolve around him.
This is America! Who cares what the world thinks.
And how do you feel about Europe and Asia talking behind your back?
Voters want the truth but you just spin.
Looks like it’s me against the world.
No, only most of the stage is a world.
I believe your time is almost up
My opponent seems to disregard the gravity of the situation!
What my opponent fails to mention is that I WILL build a wall. And Mars will pay for it!
Our next speaker will share a more global perspective.
Why is it always me against the world?!
Now, my opponent would have you believe she’s actually getting hotter with age.
And now, for a global perspective.
My opponent is all over the place.
I guess it really is me against the world.
MEDICS! Something just fell on our president!
Some days, it feels like the whole world is against me.
Would I be running for reelection if I cared what the world thinks?
Stop! It's all just spin!
... and I assert that the only reason you support the idea of global warming is your own self interest.
I too, am just warming up!
I, on the other hand, prefer to think locally.
``You're hot? Well my feet hurt. Now answer the question.''
What do you mean you’re just warming up?
My opponent's views on global climate change are clearly self-serving.
You claim to think globally, but can we afford to have a president who is bipolar?
And now, straight from its world tour around the sun...
My opponent represents everything that is wrong with the world today.
Just when the debate started to get interesting, Atlas shrugged.
Enough spin!
And to my left, the Democratic candidates for President of the United States.
This feels like it’s me against the world.
What can you say when the whole world is against you?
I suppose it really is "me against the world"!
See you in twenty-four hours.
And of course my opponent will claim to be more worldly.
My opponent accuses me of failing to understand the gravity of the situation.
Get to the point. I don't have 7.5 billion years.
I knew Jupiter. And you’re no Jupiter.
Despite our differences, I can certainly appreciate your uniquely global perspective.”
My opponent can't even give us a straight answer about their age. Are you 5,779 or 4.5 billion years old?
I'm afraid your time is up.
Respectfully, you don't speak for everyone.
I said "you're flat" not "fat".
What makes you think you can speak for the whole world?
So where is Carmen Sandiego?
I don't think you realize the gravity of this situation.
I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's age or rising core temperature.
My turn! Your 5 billion years are up.
You're getting a little heated.
I feel like the whole world is against me here.
Who in the world do you think you are?
My opponent is clearly off his axis.
I think we've all had about enough of your spin.
Yet again, it’s me against the world.
Just more spin from my opponent.
Unlike my opponent, I am not a globalist.
It’s always me against the world!
My sincere apologies to our next presenter, but, it seems, we have run out of time.
There you go again, always promising the moon!
If you're here, what are we standing on?
I would like to urge my distinguished opponent to cool down.
The World speaks for itself. The question is whether anyone is listening.
I can see Russia from here.
Yes, but act local.
It's indisputable that my opponent likes to "spin".
You just keep going in circles.
And now for a global perspective on tonight's topic...
is it warm in here, or is that just you
With all due respect, those comments reflect an incredibly biased world view.
My opponent makes every issue a global issue.
As Atlas was saying just before he shrugged...
First let me say that I think the world of my opponent.
I keep telling my shrink I am not paranoid, the whole world is against me.
I'm hot and gassy too and I don't blame YOU for it.
I feel like the whole world is against me.
You sir, are no sun.
To begin - I just want to say, I think the world of my opponent.
Being 4.6 Billion years old doesn't make you an expert in everything!
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Pluto.
Stop. You've had your turn.
Oh, now you’re the expert on climate change?
I have an axis to grind with you.
I appreciate your global perspective, however...….
Please excuse the methane release.
Don't you turn your Pacific at me! I'm talking to you!
My opponent puts a spin on everything.
At first glance the earth seems impressive, but there's a darker side.
Same old spin!
Have you ever felt like the whole world’s against you?
My opponent is just spinning around in circles!
Next thing you’re going to say is that WE are to blame for your problems.
I'd like to ask my opponent what *really* happened to the dinosaurs?
Even from this far out, New Jersey still sucks.
We keep going round and round on this issue...
I challenge my opponent to prove he originated in our solar system.
I’ve got moons, lots of moons; the BEST moons.
And believe me, this is only the half of it.
My opponent would like you to believe she can be all things to all people.
Excuse me, this is a no spin zone.
My opponent is clearly a Globalist.
My opponent's argument only holds 70% water.
You may think the world of my opponent now, 
but he will turn on you...every single day!
I am NOT paranoid! Why is the whole world against me?
My opponent is going to promise you the world.
Can there remain any doubt that my opponent’s world view is extremely self-centered?
Time's up.
Do you understand the gravity of this situation?
We all know that you're in the pocket of Big Solar.
Who are you going to believe? Me, or the rest of the world?
I'm really up against the world here.
Me against the world was meant to be rhetorical
And still you deny being a globalist?
I fully grasp the gravity of the situation.
You are not the center of the universe!
Our next speaker is no stranger to the world stage....
I'll let the world speak for itself.
You sir are not too big to fail.
It's no surprise that my opponent hides his most polarizing features.
Hey - cool down!
I, too, am mostly made up of water
I would remind my opponent that his time is up.
I always said, it’s me against the world.
Now for a global perspective!
Our next speaker needs no introduction...
And you come up here acting like the sun revolves around you!
While my opponent clearly has a global perspective, note his bias toward the western hemisphere.
So what makes you such an expert on climate change?
I believe you've had your turn.
Now who's getting overheated!?
I can see Russia from this podium.
Having the whole world on your side still doesn't make you right!
Just back from a successful revolution around the sun, let’s  give it up for Earth.
AND she claims to be an expert on global warming!  But I ask, 'WHAT ARE YOUR CREDENTIALS?'
We have still yet to see my opponent’s birth certificate.
Well, I really don’t like your latitude.
I’d like to thank everyone for being with us this evening.
Sometimes I feel as if it is me versus the world!
Again, it’s me against the world.
What world are YOU living in?
With all due respect, my esteemed colleague lacks real-world experience.
My opponent claims to be the Earth, but then what am I standing on!
And now, who better to tell us about Earth Day than our next speaker --
I'm sorry, your time is up.
Pee-ew. Did you just pass green house gas?
My opponent has Russia in his back pocket.
Your lakes are great. I will accept that.
I concede-the world is getting smaller.
When I debate, it feels like the whole world is against me.
Guess again. You’re getting warmer.
My opponent does nothing but spin!
What else are you hiding besides Europe, Africa,China, and India?
I'm sorry but you are running out of time.
My opponent continues to go in circles.
You're all over the place.
Let's get this straight--contrary to what you may have thought, things don't all revolve around you!!
In closing let me point out that my opponent has been involved for at least 10,000 years in wars, genocide, famine, corruption, hurricanes, murders--to name but a few.
I know the whole world is against me...
Mars was a friend of mine. You, sir, are no Mars.
The gravity of the situation has not escaped me!
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. You're no Pluto.
The earth would now like to speak for itself.
The "Flat Earth Society" opposes all forms of fake news and pseudo-science.
Today I feel like the whole world is against me.
Yeah, what makes you a climate expert?
I think I speak for everyone present today to remind you that not everything revolves around you.
What you lack in a degree, you make up for in real world experience
And this is what happened when Atlas shrugged.
"As you can see, the whole world is against me. Sad."
The World view seemed to dominate tonight's debate.
You're just going round in circles
Stop turning and pay attention!
Oh! So now you're an expert on climate change?
As you can see, my opponent is in a world of his own.
The 2020 Presidential Debate: Donald Trump vs. the size of his ego.
The whole world is wrong. I'm right.
Undignified? Half an hour ago you mooned me!
My opponent will promise you the world, and, yes, technically, he can deliver on that promise.
How can I have a meaningful debate with you when you keep turning on me?
Do all the Democratic candidates have to be on the stage at the same time?
Let's hear from both sides!
It’s simple, just show us your earth certificate.
Don't be fooled by his promises of the sun and the moon too.
You keep going around in circles.
My opponent thinks the world of himself  . . .
"I'm appalled my opponent would say everyone is on his side.
You just keep going around and around...
I studied Venus. I knew Venus. Planet, you're no Venus.
You're putting your spin on everything.
Accepting the award for Al Gore is...earth"
It's all about you, isn't it?
Well, yes, but that's a global point of view...
And now a word on global warming from an interested party.
And I suppose this is when you regale all of us with your “world view”
Look. It's too big to fail.
I can see my opponent needs a decade or two to cool down.
My opponent obviously doesn't respect borders!
Isn't it true that you have never produced a big bang certificate to establish once and for all that you are even a planet?
Oh, I'm just warming up.
I'm gonna stop you because I feel you're just going in circles.
Stop your relentless spinning and let's have a real debate!
I would remind my worthy opponent that it isn't the only planet in the Solar System.
Sometimes it feels like it’s me against the world.
I feel like we're just going around and around here.
My opponent's claim of "Real World" experience is greatly exaggerated.
You, sir, are a globalist!
Before you begin, I just want to say, we are glad you are here, and we are sorry for not listening.
Fake Planet.
It's obvious that my opponent does not believe, and has never believed, in 'America First.'
Ladies and gentlemen, she's mad as hell and she's not going to take it anymore... please welcome...
You're not as hot as you think.
My opponent seems to think that the universe revolves around him
..and now, for the council's consideration, we have Planet Earth seeking an eviction notice for 7,542,661,844 tenants on the grounds of ..
Excuse me, you've had your 5 trillion minutes.
I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. And you're no Pluto.
Frankly, I'm surprised by your lack of gravitas.
Excuse me, but I believe your 4.5 billion years is up
You've had your say for the last 4.5 billion years; it's my turn now.
My opponent is trying to spin his way out of this question.
Once again, my opponent uses circular logic.
I don't believe my opponent understands the gravity of the situation."
You've changed.
I knew Mother Earth, and you Sir, are no Mother Earth.
Enough of your spinning!
My opponent's term has been one disaster after another.
Atlas will be right back.
I'm not the one getting heated...
While Atlas is on his bathroom break...
And now for a more global perspective...
My opponent constantly changes his position and puts his own spin on my ideas.
Yes, yes....the Western Hemisphere....it's always the Western Hemisphere with you.
Sometimes the whole world is against me!
Okay, I'll concede you appear more worldly.
I like planets that don’t capture greenhouse gasses!
Excuse me, your time is up!
Enough with your world views.
My opponent claims he's "too big to fail", but...
You make a strong argument, but the Flat Earth Society remains unconvinced.
My opponent blames society for all of her problems.
Let me finish; you had all day on your turn.
Now, to give us a global perspective ...
Let me guess, Green party?
Did Atlas call in sick again?
Fake world
I think it’s really insensitive of you to refer to Pluto as a “dwarf.”  It prefers the term “little planet”.
Suddenly Carl found himself in the outer stratosphere, standing behind a podium on a stage of cosmic proportion, and wondering to himself “What the hell was in that chicken quesadilla?”
I demand to see your birth certificate!
I've seen no proof my opponent was born in our solar system.  I stand with the earthers!
My opponent is an unabashed globalist!"
Cool it!
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
4.5 Billion years and THIS is what you’ve accomplished? I say it’s time for new leadership!
I always knew it was me against the world.
Would Atlas please return to the podium?
And you have a clearly inflated world view!
Just because you're worldly, doesn't mean the sun rises and sets on you.
And my opponent still refuses to produce his birth certificate.
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?
Can you explain your change in position?
Now, there’s no need to get heated.
Come on, you ALL can't be running as Democratic candidates for President.
If you're there, where am I?
Let me begin by saying that I think the world of my opponent.
Stop! Do you remember what happened to Pluto?
I served with Uranus. I knew Uranus. Uranus was a friend of mine. You're no Uranus.
And are you aware, Planet Earth, that 53% of American can identify you only if you are showing these two continents?
What do you mean you've warned Mars about us?
A thought just occurred.  Shouldn't you be orbiting the Sun right now?
And who are you to tell us that global warming is real!?
I stand corrected. I guess it IS a small world after all.
Do you really think you can intimidate The Flat Earth Society so easily?
Is it getting warmer in here, or is it you?
Excuse me, but you don't speak for everyone.
Thank you. Now we'll hear from the Flat Earth Society.
On every issue my opponent just goes round and round.
Who wants a candidate you can walk all over?
Why?  Why is it always me, against the World?
Stop right there....you’re just going round and round and round. What’s your point?
Why is the whole world always against me?
There is a world of difference between me and my opponent.
Blah blah Carbon, blah blah conservation...clearly my opponent is not interested in fixing our district’s pot-holes or making our busses run on time.
Don't believe my opponent's whines about feeling too hot. Only 11,000 years ago he was complaining about the cold.
It's quite obvious that you are living in your own little world.
I object to your characterization of humanity as a transient pestilence!
Let's see if my opponent can spin his way out of this one.
It’s obvious my opponent has an inflated world-view.
Stop. We're sorry!
Mister speaker, I don't think you understand the gravity of your situation!
My opponent seems to believe that the whole world revolves around him. But that hasn't been true since the sixteenth century!
Is it getting hotter in here or is it just you?!
And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the sun, who couldn't make it.
Delivering tonight's rebuttal to the presidential address...
Our speaker this evening needs no introduction.
My opponent claims to be a climate change expert yet holds no degrees.
Just hold on a minute. You don't speak for everyone.
I feel as though the whole world is against me.
It's always "climate change" this, or "global warming" that. Do you care about anything other than yourself, ma'am?
Is that the Yucatán Peninsula, or are you just happy to see me?
And now what am I bid for Lake Erie?
Don't trust him. He's got a dark side.
I may not be as worldly as my opponent ...
Don't misunderstand the gravity of my opponent's position
There you go again.  All you think about is your survival.
In all fairness, we will hear from the dark side in about 12 hours.
Stop spinning!
Don't believe her - it's just spin!
No, it's not warm in here...it's just you.
I will stop my emissions when she agrees to stop her eruptions!
Until that last comment, I was warming up to you.
My opponent engages in nightly dalliances with a celestial body!"
Our next speaker needs no warm up.
So explain to me again, if you’re here what am I standing on?
I'm not interested in your world view!
. . .now if we zoom in you can see my house. . .
Now, I may not be as worldly as my distinguished opponent...
You see, my opponent IS a globalist!
I understand the whole world is against me, but...
The earth comes to us tonight by way of a generous contribution from The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation...and viewers like you.
I don't care how you spin it....
As you can plainly see, it’s flat.
I'd like to motion to limit the scope of this debate.
All the stage’s a world.
Your argument has as many holes as your ozone layer.
Tonight’s celebrated speaker is now the hottest he’s ever been.
... and unlike my opponent, I am not a globalist!
I don't CARE what the whole world is saying!
My esteemed opponent keeps going in circles.
...and now for a more global view...
Can you not stop spinning for even a minute?
Could you be any more Pacific?
Wow...it IS a small world!
My able opponent has a different world view than I do.
Why do you think it's always about you?
Introducing our first challenger in today’s flat earth debate.
There's no need to get overheated...
You think you're the center of the universe!
Hey, you need to cool down.
I want you to know that I will not make age an issue in this campaign."
I have a planet, too...and it's bigger than you. So big. Really big.
Don't believe my opponent. She has changed the climate of this debate, and given it her own spin.
That's clearly just spin.
Sorry but I don’t share your worldview.
You've made several billion good points, but now it's my turn.
You ever get that feeling that the whole World is against you?
I know Jupiter. Jupiter is a friend of mine. You, Sir, are no Jupiter.”
You're on thin ice.
I knew Jupiter. Jupiter was a friend of mine.
I'd like to hear what the rest of the world thinks.
Our next guest needs no introduction...
We still haven't seen a birth certificate!
Let me guess. America first.
And now, a rebuttal from the Western Hemisphere
Your response is all spin and 71% watered down
Seriously? When they said I’d be debating ‘Big Blue’, I thought they meant somebody from IBM!
You look much smaller in person.
Once again, it's me versus the world.
Sometimes it feels like it's just me against the world.
As usual, you're playing the science, evidence, and human race cards.
Mind you, I think the world of my opponent....
Everyone should know there is another side of you that is VERY different.
You clearly don't understand the gravity of the situation.
I don't care what the rest of the world thinks!
Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me.
I know Pluto. I served with Pluto. I was friends with Pluto. You, sir, are no Pluto.
Stop! You don’t have the latitude to discuss this topic.
But can you prove your other side isn’t flat?
Now, for a global view.
You simply don't understand the gravity of the situation!
I think your time's up.
As you can see, my opponent is a huge globalist.
And now, we introduce the Democratic candidates for the 2020 election.
I have to say I didn't think I would be addressing the entire world tonight.
It's always been me against the world.
I believe you're trying to change the tropic, sir.
I believe in America First unlike my opponent who is a global elitist.
Our next guest here is an expert on Global Warming.
Yeah, well - that's just Earth's opinion, and as you can see she is only offering one side of the story.
That's your 4 billion opinions.
What proof do we have that your policies will be good for the planet?
My opponent would have you believe he represents the global perspective.
Yes, I agree it's a little warm in here, but it isn't always about YOU!
As for my opponent, can you trust what doesn't stop spinning?
As you can see, the entire world has taken a different position than the U.S. on global warming
Thank you, President Trump.  And now for the opposing view on climate.
And I represent all of you who feel like, "it's me against the world!"
Go ahead!  Try to deny you're a globalist!
And now for a world view.
Yes, you finally have our attention.
Enough already with the global perspective!
My opponent, here, is notorious for putting a spin on the position.
and furthermore, my opponent is unabashedly a staunch globalist!
While my opponent is heating up, I have remained cool and calm.
Point well taken Mother.
Okay, I'm willing to concede that it's round.
A surprise speaker at the flat-Earth convention
You're obviously a big globalist!
There she goes again - blaming the rest of us for her made up problems.
Stop right there. I've got a Masters in Oceanography, a Doctorate in Environmental Management and Social Sustainability and I belong to 8 political action groups. What the hell could you possible have to tell me that I don't already know?
Once my opponent turns on you, you’re gonna see a whole different side.
Sure, my opponent has more than 4.5 billion years of experience, but does anyone really believe she stands a chance against the incumbent in 2020?
Look, there are only two.  Seven continents is only a theory.
I will deal in specifics.  My opponent offers only global generalities.
What’s the world view on this.
I am not for political purposes going to exploit my opponent's advanced age and vast experience."
And, yes, I say that 7 trillion people can be wrong!
Though the world is against me, I stand by my convictions!
Cool down, lady.
I think we all need to be concerned about my opponent’s health and longevity.
Atlas shrugged, but Dave pontificated.
Let’s not forget that what you’ve heard from my opponent on climate change is nothing more than one planet’s opinion.
My opponent can’t hide the fact that he’s a globalist.
I was right all along! The whole world really is against me!
Relax, you don’t need to get so heated.
The whole world is against me!
Hang on, ladies and gentlemen, I feel the world closing in on me.
I knew Pangea.  You, Sir, are no Pangea.
And I'm just getting warmed up."
Can we at least agree it’s a global issue?
My opponent may look like America now, but spin him around and you’ll see Iran and China!
Sir, I served with Mars. I knew Mars. Mars was a friend of mine. Sir, you're no Mars!
Look, I really don't think you can be objective in this climate change debate!
And finally, our guest speaker to tell us how it all ends.
Now, see, my opponent is getting a little heated.
I humbly submit that what the planet is saying is just one opinion.
And so my opponent wants you to 
believe, in six days with one day of rest....
You don’t have a point.
Clear enough, but there is a dark side we have to take into account.
My opponent continuously changes her position!
It seems my esteemed opponent is going around in circles.
Welcome our next guest on her farewell world tour.
My opponent is obviously a Globalist....
Globalist!
You and who else?
My opponent is wet, dry, hot, cold...what are we to believe
Hot or cold. Day or night. My opponent can't seem to make up her mind.
And our next speaker needs no introduction...
Come on. Everyone knows you were born in a galaxy far, far, away.
I think it's time we rotate and let Uganda have a turn to speak.
Oh great. Now I've got the weight of the world against me.
By now, it should be clear that my opponent relies on circular reasoning.
Who are you to tell me about global warming?
Are you really going to play the climate change card?
You know you don’t stand a chance of making it through the next four years.
Allow me to address the elephant in the room.
And up there on the left is where Hawaii used to be.
Our next speaker will help illustrate the gravity of the situation.
Unlike my opponent, I will never take certain latitudes.
Please, one continent at a time.
My opponent may have produced diamonds and sunsets, but how many barbecues in Iowa has he attended?
Atlas shrugged, and then left
Before we get started, are you okay with the temperature in here?
Given how we're treating the world, it seemed only fair to give it a chance to talk back.
It’s not such a small world after all.
I'm glad you finally came around!
First of all,my opponent thinks the world of himself.
I fear my opponent's ego hinders his judgement, as he obviously thinks the world of himself.
Is it hot in here? Or is it just me?
My opponent denies it but he is obviously a blatant globalist.
Unlike my opponent, I'm not a master of spin.
You may THINK globally, but do you act locally?
And now, the World's view
...and that's where our ancestors lived before that planet became uninhabitable...
If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the solar system!”
You do not revolve around you.
My opponent seems to think he revolves around himself.
Uh, is it getting warmer in here or is it just me?
Don't let yourselves be fooled by my opponent's down-home Earthy charm, she's a globalist!
Seriously?.... What do you know about climate change?
You don’t have a leg to stand on.
My opponent claims to know something about world opinion.
I know about Jupiter - and you're no Jupiter.
My opponent keeps changing position.
Our next speaker means the world to me.
My opponent continues to deny the gravity of the situation.
I will not make age an issue in this campaign!
Cool it, Mother.
It is very 'inconvenient' for you to appear for Mr. Gore at this debate.
Hold on, just cool down!
It appears you don't understand the gravity of your situation
There is no planet B.
Sit down dear, men are talking.
My opponent is clearly too old to be running.
And may I present our next speaker, who is no stranger to globalist thinking"..
The audience is tiring of your so-called world view.
If you truly are older than 4000 years, why do you not produce your birth certificate?
It's me against the world! But I will prevail in this election!
I tell it to you straight,while all my opponent does is spin.
My opponent perhaps, has a different world view.
I'm not as worldly as my opponent....
You aren’t the center of everything anymore!
My opponent has a history.
That's not the right answer, but you're getting warmer.
Who made you an authority on global warming!
Sigh... Sometimes I feel like the world is against me.
Once again its me against the world.
And now, for a global point of view...
We should have opening remarks from Australia in but a few hours.
So, you think you can be all things to all people?
You’re not the center of the universe so please wait for your turn to speak
Hot and bothered are we?
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the definitive expert on climate change.
You do Not speak for the entire planet!
I believe my opponent is going around in circles.
Senator, I served with Earth. I knew Earth. Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Earth.
My opponent and I are a world apart.
Look! Nobody cares what you think!
Either admit you're beholden to a powerful star or denounce the geocentric model once and for all.
Don't you turn away when I'm talking to you!
My opponent says I'm a nationalist.  Well, I say he's a globalist!
My opponent is, obviously, an unabashed globalist
My opponent may be more worldly than I, but I speak for the common man.
It doesn’t matter that the whole world is against me.  Literally.
And now a few words about climate change from a victim.
I asked for something specific, not Pacific.
And now, straight from an engagement at the Globe Theater, ...
My opponent is simply trying to put his usual spin on things.
Even if 'parasite' is technically correct, I still object to your characterization of my existence.
My opponent seems stable on the outside, however on the inside she is toxic, unpredictable, and frankly dangerous.
We've invited a special guest to talk about climate change...
No one told me it was me versus the entire world!
As for the flip -flopping accusation, my opponent changes position by the minute.
Please stop. Your gravitational pull is influencing my position.
Sorry to cut you off, Earth, but if we're going to debate the climate change issue, we can't resort to anecdotal evidence.
Sometimes I feel like the entire world is against me!
Apparently Atlas shrugged.
Do you ever get the feeling that the whole world is against you?
Can somebody from tech get up here to raise the microphone please?
Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?
And our Geography Bee winner is......
I feel like the whole world is watching.
My opponent doesn’t speak for everyone.
My worthy opponent actually embodies everything that’s wrong with the world.
And you are nothing but a Globalist, sir!
My opponent's stance is all over the map!
So what you are saying is its just water weight?"
You've exceeded your four billion year time allotment. May I please have my fifteen minutes?
I refuse to debate a "Globalist"
I disagree! Seven billion people can be wrong.
To say our next speaker is 'worldly' would be an understatement
Stop trying to spin this!
Mother Earth, please do not interrupt when men are speaking.
We're happy to have one of the hottest new speakers for you tonight, a leading authority in the debate on global warming.
I admit you do have the weight of the world on your side.
Would you care to put your spin on this?
Any last questions for Earth?
My opponent, on the other hand, can't go anywhere without everyone.
And now speaking in favor of globalism....
We have proof that you've been tilting on your axis from the very beginning, so why should we assume you're being upright now? Have you no shame?
But my opponent here understands nothing on the local level.
I always knew it would be me against the world!
My debate opponent claims to be down to earth and well-rounded but can he serve in office under the current climate? I think not!
You see! Spoken like a true globalist.
How dare you pretend to speak for Mars!
What on earth am I debating?
Apparently you are not too big to fail
Admittedly, the Green Party's candidate is strong this year.
World. The stage is yours.
Here to explain how she just keeps getting hotter every year, ladies  and gentlemen, I present Mother Earth.
As I have said over and over, "It is me against the world!"
I would like to present our guest speaker, an expert on global warming, and...
Who you gonna believe; me or the World?
I think the world of our next speaker...
...and here to tell us their thoughts on global warming ...
Is it warming in here or is it just me?
And, yes, I say 7 billion people can be wrong.
You don't look that hot to me.
Oh please, stop it! You are not!
The air conditioning is on "high" and frankly,
I'm very comfortable.
Our next speaker is a Globalist.
...and now for the global viewpoint ...
When the organizer said “you against the world,” I thought it was just a figure of speech.
I'm not going to stand here debating whether climate change is real with the whole world watching..
Some days I feel like it’s me against the world.
Let's hear your thoughts on some local issues.
My opponent would have you believe that it's own well-being is more important than a strong business environment!
Wait a minute, you've had 5 billion 
years to make your point, it's my turn!
And for all you climate skeptics out there, please welcome our next guest.
I can’t promise you the world like my opponent here, but…
And the title of tonight's debate is, 'Me Against the World'.
My opponent seems to believe he's somewhat of an authority on the subject of global warming.
It seems clear that my opponent is uncomfortable on the world stage.
I didn't know this was a global debate!
Can you state unequivocally that you are not flat?
Now let's hear from the  rest of the world!
Why thank you.  You're pretty hot yourself!
What do you know about world affairs?
Regrettably, my opponent can't seem to keep his cool.
......  AND  my opponent would have you believe that climate change has affected him personally!
Excuse me sir, I am not finished denying reality!
Excuse me.  It's not your turn.
It’s just me against the world!
My opponent is too old to be President of the United States
And now for the opposing view on climate change...
Your arguments are all circular!
But that's enough from me, let's here from the rest of the world.
As usual, my opponent is hiding behind his global policy experience.
Our host needs no introduction.
My opponent, an aging, bloated, ball of gas, cannot be taken seriously.
Whaddayamean, “Earth Day’s not enough?”
While you are obviously well-rounded on this topic, and I do think the world of you, I must respectfully disagree.
Today more than ever it's us against the world!
If my opponent claims to be a centrist, why is she spinning left?
Wait a second. If you're here, then where's...
My opponent is hiding behind a global warming agenda!
My opponent thinks the world of himself.
To most of the world, it is not a debate.
And finally, I promise to stay cool under pressure, something my opponent will never do”
No, Mars will not pay for your border wall.
At times like this, I feel like it's just me against the world.
Global warming, real or a hoax? Our next speaker brings a special perspective to the debate.
There’s another side to her we haven’t seen!
My opponent is a spin artist
“And I say that there are NO planets with intelligent life.
No no no...listen, I'll tell you exactly what the world needs!
My opponent would have you believe she is an expert on the results of climate change.
As a flat Earther...
I, too, am only just warming up!
my opponent of course doesn't have my world view
Guys, I think the world is trying to tell us something!
What is your response to recent accusations that you are, in fact, flat?
Let me finish, I waited  while the 7.53 billion of you spoke.
And furthermore, I assert that your so-called "global perspective" is nothing more than narcissism.
Every 24 hours you flip-flop.
The world does not revolve around you.
There you again, saying you speak for the entire world!
I knew Planet Earth, sir,
 and you are no Planet Earth!
My opponent will not stop spinning.
I want to thank Earth for stepping in after that unfortunate Pluto situation.
Now folks, my opponent seems to think this election is ALL about her...
And now, on the world stage, is someone who needs no introduction.
My opponent would rather sow division, while I look for common ground. We are both, for example, mostly water.
If you are who you say you are...then where are we now!!
Hey, if you're here, where am I?
Let it be noted that my opponent refused to shake my hand.
Despite her denials,it's clear that my opponent is an unapologetic Globalist.
Some will no doubt say that my opponent appears more worldly than myself.
And now Mother Earth will explain why we're screwed.
My opponent promises the moon, but does he deliver?
If you think you've got problems let's hear from our next speaker....
Who knows more about the environment, me or my opponent?
And last but not least in our Global Warming Conference,
a few angry words from Mother Earth.
This election is not about you!
First, let me begin by saying that we are worlds apart on that issue.
Clearly my opponent doesn't comprehend the gravity of this situation.
I’ll admit my opponent is striking to behold, but look more closely and she’s a hot mess.
You only seem concerned with global problems
Please give our next guest a warm welcome.
Oh sure, you CLAIM to be speaking for the whole world...
And, finally, my opponent is only 70% water!
And what makes you such an expert on global warming?
Our next speaker brings a global perspective to the issue.
Are you saying it's not a small world after all?
Further proof of a globalist conspiracy!
She constantly pivots.
My opponent is a well known globalist!
When I signed up for this Businessman vs. Earth debate, I was expecting a park ranger.
But I say all politics are local!
Oh, spare me your tilted worldview!
Why do I feel the whole world’s against me
My opponent would have you believe he is a globalist, but in reality he is a world unto himself.
But how can we be sure he actually thinks locally?
With all due respect to my fellow candidate, the science is still inconclusive.
You're getting warmer
Last but not least, we have a special guest tonight, for all of you climate change skeptics.
If I were a little younger, I'd take you outside and circumnavigate you.
Thank you Mr.  Trump.....now we'll hear from the opposition.
The whole world may be against me, but I'm telling you, I'm right.
How come it’s always about you!?
Well, you look flat from here.
Please disregard my opponent’s obtrusive attempt to make my hands look smaller.
I don't care HOW you roll as long as it's not this way!
Our next guest will now share her unique global perspective.
He's trying to spin.
And now, the Earth speaks for itself.
Every disaster we've ever had is on you!
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our expert on pollution."
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
The oil and gas industry has gotten whatever they want out of my opponent for years.
you don't seem to understand the gravity of this situation.
That's a compelling global perspective, but I don't share your point of view.
My opponent promises you the world, but don’t believe him.
Vague?! I couldn't be more Pacific.
I strongly disgree with my opponent's world view.
The representative of the Flat Earth Society yields.
Is this your good side?
You think you’re so hot!!!
So you continue to refuse to acknowledge your ties to the Sun...
Now maybe you can explain what happened to Atlas your biggest supporter
Clearly, my opponent has a globalist bias.
For millennia my opponent has been circling around solar power.
I don't like your Earth tones!
My opponent here thinks the world of himself.
My opponent's argument on global warming is clearly biased"
Think you can just roll in here and change the world?”
And I suppose you're an expert on global affairs?
Don't you turn your back on me, China!
‘“And now, taking the yes side in today’s climate action debate...”
The speaker on global  warming needs no introduction.
I feel like it’s me against the world in this debate!
I think the world of my opponent.
The country deserves better than your constant spin.
As you can see here, the World Wide Web has made the world a much smaller place.
Mother Earth, you ignorant slut.
And at that moment of the debate the tide changed.
You have no concept of the gravity of our situation.
Your mama's so fat that she invented gravity.
You can see it's flat. Anything else is fake news.
Now introducing our guest speaker on how to survive long term abuse
What on earth are you doing here?
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid that Atlas had a prior engagement.....
I've walked the earth.  I've worked on earth.  You , sir, are no planet earth.
No, YOU are a globalist!
You raise some good points, but I still say the science isn't settled.
And you, sir, are talking from Uranus!
I think you are forgetting who put you on the map.
My opponent just wants to make this climate change debate about herself.
Whoa! Atlas has shrugged!
The Flat Earth Society debate did not go as planned.
And now speaking AGAINST the Flat Earth theory.....
Our guest tonight at the Planetary Society needs no introduction...
My opponent likes to brag about her sphere of influence.
Climate change seems to be the only issue my opponent wants to discuss.
I think the world of my opponent, really.
Unlike my opponent, I will not try to be all things to all people.
See, I'm coming at this from a global perspective...
I may flip flop, but my opponent here shifts tectonically!
My opponent would have you believe that she speaks for the whole world...
Hey ! Chill already.
As you can observe, the U.S.'s self-importance is vastly exaggerated here.
You are too polarizing!
I served with Uranus, I knew Uranus, Uranus was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Uranus.
That's a circular argument, and you know it!
All this guy ever does is spin.
What makes you think you can speak for all of humanity?
Thank you for inviting me to speak on the World's stage.
As you can see, my opponent is just another global elite.
This clearly proves that the U.S.A is moving to the left.
You have no earthly idea what you’re talking about!
I guess we should stop asking for the Moon
Even as a young man shouting in the street, Buddy always knew he would take on the world someday
Hold on folks, she's just getting warmed up.
Well, that's just one opinion!
‘And our next speaker is a genuine global heavyweight...’
And then we'll extend the wall from Sishmaref to Santiago and the Eskimos will pay for it.
Somebody your size asking the rest of us to cut back? That's a laugh.
No, I don't think you revolve around me.
Wait.  We have an earth-shaking announcement.
Six days! And you think you're so special?
Is it me or is it getting suddenly warmer in here?
You look bigger on TV
if you’re over there, where am I?
Admit it.. you've never gotten over being third!
My opponent would have you believe he’s not really a Globalist...
I'm not as worldly as my opponent, but who is?
Please, what do YOU know about climate change?
And that's where the wall will go.
I never called you flat. I said you were fat.
What on earth would you know about climate change?
Just cool it!
Ladies and gentlemen let's give a nice global warming welcome to our guest.
You’re the one that squeezed plants into coal in the first place!
Is threatening me with my extinction really the best you can do?
Hello, world!
Our next speaker is very down-to-earth.
Joining us tonight for the debate on flat-Earth theory, is Round Earth.
Stop circling around the issue.
Let's give our next speaker a warming welcome...
... and now, representing the flat-earth deniers ...
As you can see, my opponent has a completely different world view...
Let's not forget my opponent's infamous 'grab Saturn by the rings' line.
No one's listening to you.
I'm a little confused about where you and I stand.
My opponent plays the victim card after every environmental disaster.
And now, it is my honor to introduce someone who means the world to me...
Well I'll tell ya, good people, it's me against the world.
I'm not kidding, I really do have the whole world against me!
My opponent knows nothing about the environment.
Who on earth do you think you are?
Reports that my opponent is heating up in the poles are ‘fake news.’
Sure, we used to think you were flat, but that doesn’t make us “stupid.”
Is Atlas still in the green room?
Our keynote speaker today on global warming.....
And my opponent is the worst kind of globalist!
I’m sick and tired of my opponent’s non-stop spinning.
Stop! You are clearly ignoring the gravity of the situation!
It may appear that it's me against the world....
Excuse me, but your attitude has completely changed the climate in this room
And  now we'll hear from the "earth is round" perspective
You're calling ME a globalist?
There she goes, playing the mother card again!
But what gives my opponent the right to think he's speaking for everyone on this issue?
My opponent is tempermental and unpredictable at her core.
And now to update us on the real news about global warming is Mother Earth!
We all want to save him, but my opponent hasn’t said anything about how much it would cost.
Please welcome our guest speaker on global warming...
And I challenge my opponent to provide evidence that he is actually getting warmer.
Enough of your global perspective.
What does this guy know about global warming?
Please hold on until I can get the other half's opinion.
One thing I'll say about my opponent. He's very down to Earth
My good friend here has an outsize view of his own importance
So, what's your worldview?
Is it me, or is it getting warmer in here?
Behind my opponent's sunny personality is a dark past.
The USA now defers to “The Paris Climate” representative.
No, that podium does not make your look flat.
What on Earth is going on...?
*I* am getting heated?
All the world's on stage.
No matter how cheerful you sound today, we know that you have a dark side as well.
How can you possibly expect us to believe that you're warming when you won't even admit you're flat?
Don't turn this around on me, YOU were the one with oil in the first place.
Sometimes it feels as though the whole world’s against me.
...because we’re Americans and we don’t care if the whole world disagrees!
Hold on, global issues will get their turn.
You say you're warming. Well, you don't look so hot to me!
No - let me tell *you* the gravity of the situation
I know my opponent thinks the world of itself...
And how do you propose to pay for this "universal " health care?
As is typical, my opponent remains conspicuously silent on the issue of climate change.
This has been blown way out of proportion.
My opponent denies that he is a globalist...….
Your Western Hemisphere bias is so blatant and obvious.
"And now, taking the position that climate change is real..."
Ok, let's talk about the millions of elephants in the room...
Wait. I’m just warming up.
The American people are tired of my opponent’s globalist policies.
Well of course YOU’D be a globalist!
This debate is going nowhere — the Earth can’t demand we be replaced by a more intelligent species.
And once again you are exaggerating your own importance in this debate on the future of Humankind!
In conclusion, it is clear my opponent is too worldly to understand the plight of the common man.
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego!
Of course my opponent is out of touch...He's four-and-a-half billion years old!
My opponent tries to make it sound as if it's me against the world.
Oh . So now she’s going to pull the old Earth card.
My opponent is obviously a globalist of the worst kind!
What could YOU possibly know about climate change???
Please stop with your spin.
As a matter of fact, I am right and the whole world is wrong!
Let me finish ! You had more the 4 billion years to develop your arguments
Ladies and Gentlemen, please give a rousing apology to the world's most prominent authority on climate change.
This debate is pointless. It feels like there’s an ocean between us.
Unlike my opponent would have you believe, not all problems have global implications.
It's not always about You!
What do you mean, "I'll be fine, it's you guys that are screwed"?  
Is that a threat or a promise?
And now, it's just 'me' against the world!
There she goes with the overheated rhetoric again.
As a Flat Earther, I refuse to believe your "science" and my own eyes.
Hold on just a minute, this has nothing to do with you
How on earth did you get in here?
Not only is my opponent a liberal, she is also under the delusion that she is not flat.
My opponent refuses to debate, claiming that he already represents the entire world.
Round is just an alternative fact.
Paper covers rock!
Perhaps my opponent would like to comment on the deadly magma it has been covering up for ages.
My opponent, as usual, is trying to put a positive spin on the issue.
Unlike you, I can't speak for everybody.
And my opponent here is going to promise you the world!
There's another side of her that most of you have never seen!
SO WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE THE WORLD OR ME?
There are two Americas!
You know, we've had hours of debate about climate change. I think I'll let the world speak for itself.
Clearly, my esteemed colleague has no legs to stand on.
Stop complaining about your issues. The world doesn't revolve around you.
And with all due respect, what in the world would you know about it?
Please proceed, Mother Earth, you have five minutes to rebut Mr. Trump.
Don't feign nationalist priorities when you are so obviously a globalist!
Of course I can hear you, but I don't believe you!
Don't stand there and play the victim to me.
I want to thank you again for the chance to co-host this Flat Earth Society conference.
Hold on, you’re telling me you’ve never seen ‘An Inconvenient Truth’
Do you ever feel like the world is closing in on you?
What on Earth did you just say?
I'll show you exactly what on Earth I am talking about.
My opponent is a flip-flopper. Take the magnetic poles, for example.
Can we please have a debate where you don't completely take over the stage!?
We will pick up with our lecture about Asia in about 16 hours.
What more evidence do you need that my opponent doesn't have a point?!
And now let's hear from my opponent... a supposed expert on global warming.
I’d like to speak for the eastern hemisphere...
We have nothing to fear but hemisphere itself!
I'd say your connection to South America raises questions of collusion.
And you misled the people indicating that you were a small world after all.
That's a circular argument!
You can't just roll in here and say that.
My opponent naively perceives herself as an expert on global climate change.
My opponent has a limited world view.
And here to give us the big picture is...
To kick off our Global forum today I'd like to introduce our first speaker...
I find my challenger's Earth First campaign to be nothing more than thinly veiled self-serving platform.
In last night's debate, Mr. President repeatedly insisted the whole world was against him.
...and the United Nations will pay for the fence.
I too am a globalist.
Well, one thing my distinguished opponent and I agree on is that it is too warm in here.
Unlike my opponent, I can promise I will never change my position.
Madame speaker, be assured that my opponent will soon reveal another side.
Don't worry - I have asked them to turn the AC up!
You need to see the big picture!
As we all know now, my opponent takes a world view.
All this stage is a world.
I don’t understand where you’re coming from!
There you globe again . . .
Sometimes I feel like it's me versus the world up here!
My opponent yet again advocates turning his back on Europe."
...and my opponent continues to insist that global warming is real.
Your isthmus is showing!
Why on earth would you say that?
I know you collided with other planets.
Folks, are you hearing this spin?
Why is it always all about you?!?
The climate of these debates sure is changing.
I told Atlas not to shrug
Our next speaker has a first-hand experience of climate change.
... He'll never bring jobs to Smallville.  My  opponent only thinks globally.
You think I'm angry now?  I'm just getting warmed up.
Larry’s worst fears are confirmed that it’s always been him against the world.
Certainly a speaker that should need no introduction, however ...
And YOU need to stop circling around the issue here!
From where I’m standing, you still look pretty flat.
I may  have the whole world against me in this debate, but...
Back off, I'm warming you.
One more globalist?
Yes, but can you *prove* you're round?
Small wonder you call yourself a Globalist.
Like I've been saying all along, it's me against the world!
At times like this, I feel that the whole world is against me.
Unlike my opponent, I promise to keep my cool.
Folks, sometimes it's easy to feel like it's you versus the whole world.
With all due respect, I think you are taking a very one-sided view of the world.
How does my opponent KNOW she's not just having another hot flash?
I implore you to take into account the gravity of the situation.
You're only half right."
The last thing we need is another polarizing President.
Why are you even running? You won't be around for much longer!
And with his other face he kisses up to Russia.
North America is going to speak on behalf of the world again, huh?
My opponent would like you to think it’s me against the world
My opponent would have you believe the Earth is round.
On the contrary, I do think you should revolve around me!
Though he scored some rhetorical points, Morris was no match for his opponent in the Flat Earth Society Debate.
And are the allegations true that you have taken explicit, unauthorized pictures of Uranus?
I understand you have serious  injuries, but a globe is not a person. Now if you were a corporation, you would have a case.
I'm not afraid to take on the world.
You're always shifting your position!
My opponent is well rounded but nevertheless lacks good judgment.
There you spin again
Atlas ... Atlas? We can't hear you down there.  Can't you get closer to the mike?
Why blame me? Who created fossil fuels to begin with?
Hold on! You'll get your turn.
I’m not going to make my opponent’s age an issue in this campaign.
And what experience do you have?
As soon as the world stepped on stage Jon felt the temperature in the room rise dramatically
NO - the whole world is NOT a stage
Unfortunately, this simulation developed
 a fatal virus called Homo Sapiens.
Enough with the circular reasoning!
No need to get so heated.
Turn sideways so we can see if you’re really round
No really, I feel like the world is against me.
Nobody knows more about the world than I do.
There you go again...rotating your position."
Trust me, I'm just warming up.
My opponent acts as if the moon revolves around her.
Mother I'm not going to get into a debate with you.
If we were on the radio and not TV, I would be winning this debate!
And now  a speech about Global Warming from the only opinion that counts.
Look, I didn't call you a loser, a terrible, very bad planet...maybe the worst planet in the solar system, and far from the biggest. That was fake news and this debate about climate change is over!
My opponent acts like the world revolves around him... oh."
Next, you'll deny you're a globalist.
Maybe it's time you took some responsibility for your own 
well-being.
What credentials does my esteemed opponent have regarding climate change?
Unlike my opponent, I speak for more than just half of the world.
This candidate claims to represent all of you . . .
Like you, I am just warming up...
No, YOU'RE polarizing the issue!
Now, if you could please rotate, so that I may debate Eurasia.
It only looks round!
Welcome to the climate change conference. 
The first to speak is Mother Earth.
Yeah?!  Well, I'm freezing!
Did it get warmer all of the sudden, or is it just me?
And what would YOU know about "climate change"?
Please, the whole world is always against me.
Stop orbiting the question.
No, Mr. President, I AM the real world.
Well, size isn't everything!
Our expert on Climate Change will now speak
I have recently uncovered a sibling of my opponent that he refuses to acknowledge.  Pluto, come on out here….
And now I let her tell you more about the gravity of the situation.
What on earth is your point?!?
I object to my opponent's description of me as small and insignificant!
And now we'll hear the anti flat-earth perspective.
My opponent is a master of spin: in the last debate he was flat as a pancake.
You're getting too heated.
Small world.
Atlas, your rebuttal. Atlas?
Have you ever felt that the whole World was against you?
Just admit that you're nothing but a shameless globalist!
Even my opponent is warming to me!
As you can see, the blue wave is coming
And to all my detractors who say I have no world view.....
Our final climate change panelist has dire warnings.....
No,  I don't think you look flat.
I believe we can find some common ground.
I'm not sure you're grasping the gravity of what I'm saying.
Sure, my opponent has a lot of experience in world affairs...
And now it's my pleasure to introduce EVERYBODY'S mother!
My opponent will literally turn its back on you.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.
I refuse to sugarcoat facts while my opponent wraps himself in the earth’s mantle, concealing his molten core.
My hands are not small!
Next thing you know, he’ ll be mooning me!
While I think the world of my opponent...
Fine, you can have Florida, but New York stays afloat!
Excuse me, but did my opponent just say, “Earth to Mr. Johnson?”
Where’s Waldo?
And a round of applause for Earth stepping in last minute for Pluto at this year's planet summit.
Would you stop spinning for a moment and pay attention!
"I would ask the audience to hold their applause until I've had a chance to introduce everyone."
”...And our next guest is hotter than ever...
Our next speaker is the hottest thing right now.
...a planet that needs no introduction...
It is a small world after all.
And unlike my opponent I promise to think locally and act purely for personal gain.
And please welcome our guest speaker to this annual meeting of the Flat Earth Society
My opponent thinks the world revolves around him
Let's stop talking about revolution.
I know our audience will appreciate the gravity of your situation
Looks like we're going to need a bigger wall!
Our core values are fundamentally different
He has a dark side that will chill you.
George faced an unexpected challenge to his claim to be the World's best debater.
And what so-called proof do have that the world is not flat?
It seems my opponent is overly focused on global issues.
Now listen--hey, don't you turn your back on me!
My opponent’s argument is at least two-thirds under water
Atlas, get back here !
It's not fair I only get 15 minutes. You've had four and a half billion years.
Warming Schwarming— you’re only having hot flashes!
Our next speaker is internationally known...
Really?  Do you know how many times I shovelled my driveway last winter?
And we at Fox News demand this is a flat disc and not a globe, and if it's not a globe then how can there be 'global warming' eh?
Hold on, I didn't interrupt you on the climate change questions.
Can you believe SHE is running as a #MeToo candidate?
My opponent continues to hide his Russia connections!
I am afraid that my esteemed opponent and I are worlds apart!
And unlike my opponent, I do not try to be all things to all people.
And now, for the right hemisphere point of view.
My opponent likes to tout his worldliness as a strength
Ladies and gentlemen, when I speak the world listens.
I know Neptune. You sir, you're no Neptune.
That's right China, I'm speaking to you.  Don't you dare turn your back on me.
Why is every one on your side!?
Clearly my opponent is too worldly.
Unlike my opponent, I will not forget the good people in Hawaii.
....while my opponent, though very worldly, has a decidedly western view of things.
Let's see who revolves around who.
Whoa!... Who do you think you are? My Mother?...
Can you be more Pacific in your response?
My opponent clearly thinks he's the center of the universe.
You are clearly biased when it comes to climate change.
I know Atlas, Atlas is a friend of mine, and , you sir, are no Atlas
See, I told you it was all just spin.
"It's obvious that my opponent has a globalist agenda!
...But my opponent is all spin!
Sheer hubris -- My opponent believes that he represents the whole world!
My opponent happens to be all wet, or at least seventy-one percent.
Cool down!
What makes you think you’re a Global Expert? Fake News!
Our next speaker literally means the world to me!
I'll give you that point.  However, ice caps aren't everything.
My opponent is not healthy enough to survive her term in office.
And I remind my opponent, all politics is local.
My opponent is just spinning as usual.
And our next speaker deserves our undivided attention!
Many of you scoffed when I promised you the world...
Global warming!, what makes you an expert?
My opponent is a unapologetic globalist!
The Flat Earth Society begs to differ.
I'm not sure you fully comprehend the gravity of this predicament.
As you can see, my opponent is a globalist.
I challenge you to think out of your hemisphere
Earth, please, wait your turn.
I believe you are not seeing the big picture, Sir
Our next presenter will provide a worldview on this topic...
You are on a roll, but I'll have to stop you here.
My opponent is older than dirt!
Now take my opponent here, who pretends to speak for the whole world.
Enough about you.
I don't care if you're representing seven billion constituents, I deserve equal time.
I told you we're trying to turn the heat down. Just be patient.
Nobody cares about your inflated world view!
I knew Atlas would be a noshow.
Let's talk about your global presence...
What makes you think you're the expert on climate change?
And we can't ignore my opponent's blatant conflict of interest with regards to the issue of climate-change!
You have been accused of warming! How do you respond?
Welcome to the first International meeting of the Flat Earth Society, I would now like to introduce to you our guest speaker...
What do you mean that humans are a virus that will soon run its course?
Sure, but can you prove you aren't flat?
Accept it, you're flat. But here you are, being bipolar
And making her final appearance ...
I have 7.7 billion constituents and counting.  What's your base?
She's had her 4.5 billion years.
Size matters? Is that all you've got?
While I appreciate the global perspective, we still need a wall.
My opponent lacks a solid core.
There you rotate again.
Excuse me but I also know a thing or two about climate change.
The next speaker is here to warm up the crowd.
My opponent has the gall to assert that her health is more important than corporate profits
That question came out of the blue.
You may have more real world experience, but I'm a man of the people.
And now, here to refute the "flat earth"  propoents, I present....
Our new head of global marketing needs no introduction.
Yes, ma'am, it does seem to be getting warmer in here.
Oh let me guess, your position on day light saving has changed... again.
Going once, going twice...
Only one of the candidates could truly be described as "well-rounded".
It only *looks* like it’s me against the world
Let me stop you right there.
Don't let my opponent fool you. He is a globalist.
You're flat wrong!
What goes around comes around!
Unfortunately, our guest speaker, Atlas, was hospitalized with a neck injury.
I think it’s fair to point out that my opponent is a Globalist.
As usual, my opponent continues to go round in circles.
Stop whining!  You’ll still be here when the rest of us are gone.
Unlike my opponent, I have a global view.
Let me remind my friend, all politics is local.
Sure, but next to Neptune you don't act so tough.
And now let’s hear from the America’s with their side of the story.
"Your oceans are as dirty as your politics! "
If you want to recover from climate change, you first have to admit you have a problem!
No, you don't speak for the whole world!
Oh, so you think you can speak for everybody?
There's a whole other side to you.
This is why I feel the world is always against me!
It was ever thus -- one man against the world!
Of course you can take a bathroom break.  You are 70% water.
And in a minute, the Eastern Hemisphere’s rebuttal.”
As for my opponent’s more heated perspective . . .
It may be me against the world, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong!
I am really a much more down-to-earth candidate than my opponent
My opponent has shown he is not capable of carrying the weight of the World on his shoulders.
And now, to kick off our Flat Earth debate...
And now to explain the effects of global warming ....
Don't think you're going to win this debate by "going global" on me again!
Stop playing the victim card!
I can see my house from here!
Let me tell you what the world needs...
Don't everybody talk at once!
You're here to tell me the whole world thinks I have small hands!?!?
Again, we see my opponent going global when I'm trying to talk specifics...
This is not about you!
You are so bipolar about climate change!
I'm detecting a change in the climate of this debate.
You are fake news, the world is flat.
Why is nobody asking 'Girthy Earthy' over here about her  controversial 'Pangaea Years'?
I promise my turn won't take all day.
That's just your perspective on global warming!
Our next speaker brings a truly global perspective . . .
Oh spare me. I took off my Jacket and I'm fine.
Be prepared for a heated debate!
It's my turn.
Who in the world are you?
Chill, Dude!
Is it getting warmer up here, or is it just you?
I personally would like to extend you a warm welcome.
And more than Utopian, my opponent's demands for a Green New Deal are completely self-interested!
Is that all you do? Just spin, spin, spin?
I think we should take a break to cool off
I've cut taxes for my constituents and eliminated plastic straws. What on earth have you done?
But where is your birth certificate?
I hear you,  but what does the Eastern Hemisphere have to say?
Earth: #MeToo
Why doesn't he show his birth certificate?
Who will voters believe - a climate denier like me, or my hysterical opponent
Our guest may be unfamiliar to some of you....
You don't understand the global implications.
I never back down...even when I learned this debate actually was me vs the world!
I know there have been reports that my opponent is just warming up, but frankly I haven't seen evidence to support that claim.
Stop lying! We all know you're flat!
Let's give a warm Mars style welcome to our dear old friend, Earth.
I firmly disagree that my opponent speaks for everyone.
Well, I have a different world view!
You can't handle the heat!
...."The rest of the world--you have 2 minutes for your rebuttle."
Where is Atlas when you need him.
This is so fake, folks. He's actually very, very flat!
The Earth needs no introduction although some people have apparently forgotten about it.
You've already warmed up.
Clearly you cannot believe what you see in front of you, my opponent is flat, and anything else is fake news!
I categorically OBJECT to the tactics of my opponent in this flat earth debate!!!
Well, I got the popular vote!
America First!
… while my opponent just stands there getting hot under the collar.
My opponent clearly has a planet-sized ego.
You're missing the big picture.
Has anybody seen Atlas?
I'm not going to debate it with half the world
Pictured above: The first 2020 presidential debate.
And here to present the other side of the global warming debate ...
Shame! My opponent voted against Pluto staying in the Solar System!
My opponent’s presence belies the gravity of the situation!
And why should we believe your claims on climate change?
Don’t all talk at once!
well, it doesn't feel warm in here to me!
While my opponent *claims* to be thinking globally, I believe we can all see a distinctly North American bias.
Oh great, another critic on climate change
My opponent seems to have been crushed by the weight of the world.
Meanwhile at the UN Climate Change Tribunal: "The Court will now hear victim impact statements"
I think the world of my opponent but his argument doesn't hold water.
Ok ok, it's not a hoax
Call me a dwarf planet again and I’ll kick your Australia.
When we promise our students the world, we deliver!
. . . . and I have been authorized to speak on behalf of the other seven planets about their experiences with ignoring climate change."
Typical globalist!
But if you're here, what planet are we on? None of this adds up!
Why, my opponent seems to be warming up to me!
Speak English,please
As I was saying, I've always felt like it's me against the world
The world will try to tell you otherwise, but I’m here to tell you...
Is it really a matter of such gravity?
And as you can see, my opponent wants totally open borders!
Hey, don’t get heated with me.
Of course my opponent backs the Green New Deal, she’s a globalist.
And now the keynote speaker's firsthand account of global warming.
Atlas has left the building!
Being in the majority doesn't make you right!
As you can see, my visual aid has crushed my debate opponent and his flat earth premise.
And now--Our next World expert really needs No introduction!
You'll get your turn when I'm finished
It's just you and me against....oh, wait...
I have here a sworn statement from a Mr. Atlas that says you have lied about your weight.
What would my opponent know about climate change?!"
...and pay no heed to my opponent who is clearly a globalist.
Here to speak tonight is Mother Earth... and she is a little disappointed in you.
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF YOUR WORLDVIEW
Oh, sure... my opponent looks cool and international on the surface. But underneath, seethes a core of molten magma.
Yeah, you and who else?
Your plan is all about YOU, isn't it? You say, 'My air is dirty. My water is polluted. My animals are dying!' I say Americans are tired of narcissistic politicians!
It’s not a small world after all.
How on earth did you come up with that?
If I want to call you my oyster, by God, I'll call you my oyster.
Yes.....sometimes I do feel my stance is 'me against the world'!
I said “All the world IS a stage” , not on it!
We'll stop there for today, and the Eastern Hemisphere will pick things up where we left off.
No, no. You've had your turn.
Your time is up.
Now Madam Earth, isn't it true you're just perimenopausal and temperatures are expected to return to normal in some years?
My opponent lacks gravity.
And without further ado, a word from our host.
You're blowing this thing way out of proportion!
This is what it’s come to, since none of you will listen to the scientists.
This is only 1/2 of the story
We could finally get rid of daylight saving time if you would stop your tilting.
Lock her up!
OK, now things are going to get heated.
Do not be deceived by my opponent's claims of international experience!
Stop! You’re over inflating your importance!
There you go again,throwing your weight around.
Don’t bring my sun into this.
In spite of what some may think, this is bigger than me against the world.
Can you move a little more to the right, you are blocking the air-conditioner.
Where’s Hawaii?
Don't deny you're a globalist.
Just who does my opponent think he is, claiming to speak for the entire world!
Everything my opponent says about climate change is fake news.
I was going to mention the state of the planet, but it speaks for itself.
And here to talk about the global economy...
Do you have to globalize everything?
My turn - your turn went a full day.
There you go again, always spinning in favor of the globalist agenda.
My opponent, here, wants you to believe in something she calls, 'scientific consensus'
Our next speaker claims to be quite the expert on climate change...
I have to say at this point that I feel threatened
As you can see, my opponent is self-inflating.
I think the world of my opponent, but...
Can you even name the seven continents?
...In contrast, my opponent thinks the world of himself.
How can I debate you? You've come 180 degrees on your argument.
May I just say, you are my Oyster.
Yes, but you are using the word "round" as if it is a good thing.
As you can plainly see, the Chinese are behind this!
As you can see, my opponent is the very image of an unrepentant globalist.
Senator, I served with Neptune. I knew Neptune. Neptune was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Neptune.
Yeah? Well my opponent was once involved in a big bang, too!
Wait a second!  When I elected to take on the Global Challenge, this isn't what I had in mind.
We've been talking about it long enough. Now is the time to let the planet speak for itself.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the English-speaking world!"
I'm just getting warmed up
What we need is a "world view," my opponent clearly does not have that.
Could you turn around to show you’re actually round?
Like my opponent,I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders.
Open your eyes people! The threat of globalization is real.
I still say you are flat
Are you threatening me with extinction?
Let me start by just saying, you've always meant the world to me.
And to show my sincerity, I'd like to buy my opponent a Coke.
It’s pretty much has always been me against the world. This debate however, takes it to a whole new level.
Another expert on global warming.
Now, first up -- speaking for the ozone layer.
. . .and you sir are no Pangea!
I yield to my opponent who would like us all to go somewhere else.
I don’t care if the whole world is against me, I do not believe in global warming!
You don’t intimidate me, you’re mostly water weight
Stop, stop, stop!  We don't want to hear from a climate-change radical.
I'll stop addressing you as the pale blue dot when you start addressing me as Dr. Sagan.
It’s me against the world in 2020.
I would challenge my opponent to pick a hemisphere.
Now, my opponent is gonna try to use “facts” and “science” about climate change to try to scare ya, but it’s fake news, people!
Let the World speak for itself.
I understand that you are the World, but are you the Children?
Consider this your global warning!
America, sir, will not let globalism crush our dreams.
Well, that's your opinion.
So,as you can see,"me against the world" was NOT hyperbole as my opponent has claimed.
That's circular reasoning...You keep going around and around and around.
Hi Mom !
And now, our world-renowned expert on world climate change.
My opponent talks big, but hides half of his true self.
I'm the only candidate prepared to take on the world!
Is it just me, or is it hot in here?
I said you're incompetent, not 'incontinent.'
Stop right there! We booked the Eastern Hemisphere to speak tonight!
This year the Golden Globe goes to....
'"My opponent is trapped in circular reasoning!"
Can I speak to your Russian side, please!
From now on, we will hear the testimony of the victim of global warming.
you‘ve had all the time in the world to make your point, now it’s my turn
Actually, there are five Great Lakes.
I'm right and the world is wrong
My worthy opponent seems to be living in his own world.
I apologize for my opponent's behavior, he's getting very heated.
Indeed, it is a small world after all.
As you can see, this new technology brings the world closer.
Today's speaker is seeking political asylum.
Okay Atlas . . .who shrugged?
Nobody does global politics better than me. No one.
So, Mr. Atlas, what is your position on global expansion?  Mr. Atlas?...Mr. Atlas?...
Could we please have a question on something other than climate change?
There’s an ocean of difference between my views and those of my opponent.
Things may seem dark right now, but I’m certain you’ll turn it around!
Following Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot success, Ed misjudged his Ted Talk audience
Yeah? Well, I’m telling YOU that climate change is a HOAX!
My opponent over here seems to be getting a little heated!
The whole world is against me in this debate!
And speaking of global affairs...
If my opponent thinks I'll get pulled into their orbit, they've got another thing coming.
The title is "What goes around, comes around."
I think the world is trying to tell us something.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce MotherEarth on her Farewell Tour
You heard the moderator, your time is up. And if I'm voted into office, I'll make sure of it!
I assert that my opponent is clearly out of its orbit!
Our next speaker will dispel the flat earth myth.
You yielded your time, it's my turn to talk about the environment.
Today the President will put an end to the fake news that he does not know the names of the continents.
Read my lips: No new axes!
I might remind you, Sir, that a mere 97% of experts who've studied the matter agree with you
All of the white space was once habitable.
You know what they say about planets with small polar ice caps...
My opponent’s plan would take ages.
Even though the whole world is against me, I'm undaunted!
I will not be intimidated by my opponent.
I agree we can put that whole flat earth debate to bed.
On this issue, I'm sure my opponent, like all Progressives, will claim to speak for the World.
Oh, now you're warming up to me?
'I'm sorry,  but us flat earthers need more conclusive proof.'
The white areas are recent Facebook outages.
Next side, please.
Bob felt like the whole world was against him.
I am not now, nor have I ever been, an extraterrestrial.
Senator, I lived on Mother Earth. I knew Mother Earth. Mother Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Mother Earth!
Stop playing the global warming card.
You are a hoax.
Everyone knows you’re flat.
What was it like coming out as Gaia?
My opponent would have you believe global warming is real!
Despite the evidence before me, I still maintain my opponent is flat.
And we are supposed to just take your word that global warming is real?
Closing arguments will be three minutes, except for earth, who will have eternity.
I understand your position, but no need to get heated!
Please stop overstating what you bring to the table.
Unlike my opponent, I'll resist taking such a polarizing position.
There is literally a world of difference between us.
‘What on earth..??’
Now my opponent here claims global warming is real.
So I ask  you, what qualifies my opponent  to speak on world problem.?
While I appreciate your perspective...in the context of the universe, you are really not that relevant.
I just think we have differing world views
No one wants to hear your environmental claptrap.
Unlike my opponent I speak for the one percent
You expect me to debate the world?
Getting a little heated, are we?
My opponent claims to be decisive yet somehow can’t decide on a single language.
No, all the world is not on stage!
Whew, someone’s got a terrible gas problem.
Thanks for leaving your orbit, now do you feel the gravity of our situation ?
Well, I act locally!
And here’s my opponent who just rolled in to give you some really bad news.
Empirical evidence aside, you're flat.
As a white man, I obviously know more about the environment than Mother Earth.
Stop turning to the audience and answer me!
With absolutely NO academic or scientific credentials, how can you stand there and tell us global warming is real?!
Going, going............
And just how is it our fault that you run hot and cold?
Will you please do me a favor and stop rotating, you're making me dizzy.
I'm a politician, dammit.
I don't have to listen to you.
On second thought, warming up before the debate is entirely optional.
And I'll speak for the rest of us.
Hold it, don’t everybody speak up at once!!
You look fine to me.
Well... you're fat.
You think you're the center of the universe! Stop throwing your weight around.
Our next speaker is out of this world.
We've discovered this lovely blue planet in orbit around a distant star in our galaxy that supports life. But there are no signs of intelligent life.
Okay, let me stop you right there.
As you can see, the opposing candidate is full of hot air.
You are out of orbit!
This is not what I meant by a worldwide debate!
And I ask you, who created those fossil fuels?
While my opponent might have science on its side, I have the unerring wisdom of Twitter on mine.
My opponent promises the world but don't be fooled by cheap parlor tricks.
I have a certain global perspective that the other candidates don't.
As you can see, my opponent and I are a world apart on the issues.
Could you move the microphone further from D.C? Thanks.
Now my next statement may send you into orbit...
Tell us again why we should care.
He’s got the whole world on his stand.
My opponent would like you to be believe he is somehow more worldly than you or I
My opponent likes to put the spin on just about every position.
Quit complaining, we’re all hot in here”.
I can't take this. Make the world go away.
You're just here for the air conditioning.
You do look flat!
Why yes, it is warm in here.
And our keynote speaker is the late great planet earth.
The country is frankly fed up with  your constantly revolving positions.
This is THE conference on climate change! You can’t just roll in here and expect a seat at the table!
What do you mean my time is up?
A vote for me, Donald Trump, and I can make all this go away.
So please, during the debate, no releasing of noxious clouds of methane from your tundra.
And I disagree with your world view!
Next, we will hear from the Western Hemisphere.
My worthy opponent's global ambitions won't fix the potholes in our city.
You don’t speak for all of us!
Here with an opposing viewpoint is a globalist.
My very, very brilliant scientists, and they’re like really smart,  are telling me that the Trump Administration is a hoax, okay?
And you think you're better suited to deal with the problems of the world?
And now, a word from our Mother.
I don't believe in global warming and won't be bullied by someone much larger than me.
How do you call yourself global when you are clearly only representing the western hemisphere?
I'm sure our next guest needs no introduction
So who ya gonna trust, me or this ignorant orb?
I'll gladly address all your issues, but only once you tell me how you got into this building.
If Fox says you're flat, you're flat.
This is hardly what I had in mind when I agreed to debate a globalist!
Is it just me or is it getting warmer in here?
My opponent would have you believe that she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders....
Year after year, you just can’t help yourself from circling back to the same point.
You may have the world behind you, but I have the money.
The problem is clearly bigger than both of us.
Do not be fooled by appearances! My opponent only seems to be down-to-earth.
My opponent appears to be having hot flashes.
I got it, it's me against the world.
Ok, so maybe humans did cause it, but we didn't mean to.
Despite my opponent's outlandish claims and bizarre histrionics, my belief in a flat earth is stronger than ever...
My opponent’s world view is inflated.
Hey, I can see my house from here!
Is my opponent getting HOTTER or is it just me?!
And yet, my opponent claims that I blow things out of proportion.
Well, that’s not what Mars said!
Ok! I admit it! Climate change is real!
You may have all the facts in the world, but I have public opinion on my side.
Cut the global positioning
I take issue with your heated argument.
I cede 2,000,000,000,000,000 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Solar System
Before I present our keynote speaker; Would event staff please lower the thermostat?
Oops, we seem to have lost Atlas.
Earth, you ignorant slut!
You may have the world on your side, but I know I’m right!
What the liberal candidate WON'T tell you is that he's been involved in every bad thing that has ever happened!
I thought you were bigger.
Once again, my opponent and I are worlds apart on this issue.
You take one position, then do an about face and it's the very opposite.
My opponent is full of hot air.
But Europe and Asia are on the other side of your position.
You what ? You just rolled over a guy with yellow hair and a long red tie ?
Only a closeted socialist would believe my opponent "supports life as we know it"
Sooo...trying to intimidate me on a global scale, eh?
I'm here to remind you that America is not the world.
I can tell from that last comment that you’re getting a bit heated.
You made your point, but what does the other half of the world have to say?
Nobody has ever been more round than I am, that I can tell you.
You get your climate under control.  Then we'll talk.
The whole world is listening.
Theory yes,but what does my opponent know for a fact about climate change?
And this is the planet earth, a bleak and forbidding place that once supported a primitive life-form inexplicably bent on self destruction.
So what?  MY earth is much, much bigger!
I'm sure it is hard to hear that you only have twelve years left.  May I suggest a bucket list?
And last, but not least. Mother Earth.
I apologize, no reason to get hot.
And I repeat, it's just us against the world.
Trumps Ted Talk on Global Warming... "We've got a Earth, a big big Earth, the biggest Earth that Earth has ever seen"
The Democratic field is crowded.
Indeed, my opponent’s life revolves around me.
The time for action has come....the world has spoken.
Global warming? What planet are you from?
So as you can plainly see, its round on this side, but its flat on the other!
Absolutely! But I could give you a better answer if your question was a little more Pacific.
What possible impact could you have on me?
Sorry, I think we have more pressing matters to discuss than your personal health.
On the other hand, look at my opponent.  She's all over the place!
Now we get to hear from the small world after all!
That's quite the spin you put on it!
Not buying it, still flat.
Who would ever elect everyone's mother and an obvious globalist?"
Sir, I lived on the earth in 1950. The earth in 1950 was my home. You are no earth of 1950.
And now for the  "climate change isn't real" rebuttal.....
I just want to say that I think the world of our next speaker.
You're always throwing shade."
Don't go all global on me!
Flat?!  Do I look flat to you?
Do not listen to my opponent. Clearly, he is a globe-alist.
I believe my opponent is involved in a global conspiracy!
I know an occident waiting to happen when I see one.
Enough with your global elitist spin!
Will you please cool off!!
Hold It!! Atlas is still in make-up.
Sure, my opponent seems American. But he hides an insidious socialist secret behind his back.
Perry makes the best of his magnificent opportunity to address the world at large.
My opponent is spinning lies!
It's true - the internet does make the world smaller
My opponent presents the Western viewpoint...
We both read 'Atlas Shrugged', but one of us took it too literally.
Yes, I do stand by my position that the earth is flat.
My opponent would have you believe he is round
We get it. Your platform is climate change.
My most worldly opponet yet
She needs no introduction.
All my stage is a world!
It's getting a little warm in here.
My opponent thinks he is so worldly!
Now, I know my opponent claims to have something in common with every single one of you....
Well, that’s one opinion.
Well of course 'Big Earth' is against climate change.
Let me ask you this: What has my opponent ever done for you?
Don't blame us! You're the one who turned dinosaurs into oil!
I object!  You are only showing one side.
Wait, one at a time.
And although my opponent will say she has the entire world on her side . . .
You just think you're getting warmer.
And now, we finally will listen to the Earth!
I am sick and tired of people speaking for the Earth-
Let the Earth speak for herself!
Oh you think your so worldly!
this is just a debate,you need to cool down.
I say, release those so-called evolutionary records, Madame!
There it  is !  My half world view.
No sir, it only "feels" like the weight of the whole world is on your shoulders.
So, can you tell us all a little more about this 'round-earth theory' of yours?
It’s easy for your to say, “think locally, act globally,” but what about the rest of us?
Hold it right there...how can you claim to speak for the whole world when I stand here in opposition ?
Global domination on a world stage.
It is with great pleasure that I introduce someone you've all been dreading to hear speak.
Fake news! the world is flat.
Excuse me. Excuuuse me! Let me finish before you overheat.
And arguing that climate change is real....
Oh, and what evidence can you submit that PROVES you're not actually flat?
A vote for me is a vote against the world.
I yield my time.
Thank you, Ms. Terra, your five minutes are up. The spokesman from OPEC will now read a rebuttal.
You shouldn't allow yourself to get so heated!
That's quite the costume, Donald.
OK,OK, we'll listen!
You wouldn’t know it from my opponent, but there’s a whole other side to this story.
With all due respects,my opponent's personal experience with the enviornmental impact of human activity is anecdotal and , therefore,not relevant to our debate.
Please try to resist my opponent's natural gravity and focus on the issues.
Your perspective is way off.
Nobody cares what YOU have to say.
I don't think you have the authority to talk about global warming.
Sorry, but we don't care for your opinion on climate change
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I introduce the Democratic Nominee for President, The World.
While my opponent may have a world view....
You think you have problems? Welcome to MY world!
Do you know who I am?
I've come here to say: I'll be fine. You'll be dead. Keep up the good work.
I  mean, it's flat.  Look how flat it is.
They say that the whole world is against me, but I know it's not true. Some of the smaller countries are neutral.
Adios to my opponent!... crushed by carrying the weight of the world on his shoulder.
Who are you to say the earth isn't flat?!
And now to speak to us about global warming.
Don't be fooled. My opponent is simply putting its own spin on the same old argument.
When the world talks, people, listen
I am pointing to the only country on the planet that is not fighting climate change.
And ask yourself: who exactly will my opponent represent?
That's it? Hardly earth shattering news.
OK, you made your point: you are round.
Why should voters believe you about global warming?
Clearly my opponent has taken his view of globalization too far.
Ma’am, please calm down. I’m afraid you’re getting a little heated.
You fit into a two-dimensional cartoon, that proves you're flat.
No, no -- you're confusing weather with climate.
When we at the EPA were invited to this debate on climate change, we weren’t told we would be debating the entire world!
So you just expect us to take your word for it that you're getting warmer?
You don’t seem warm to me!
And now Gaia will speak to the pro side for human extinction.
Bet you can't spin that one.
I can tell you right now that you are most certainly not warming at all, and what's more, you're flat...
My opponent refers to herself as a so-called expert on climate change, but I don't buy it.
How dare you speak for the world!
Apparently, my opponent considers herself the "change" candidate.
We don't care what the world has to say. We're America!
Easy, big fella! Some boundaries! Please!
My opponent will try tonight to convince you that he is flat.
Hold it right there. Prove that you're getting warmer.
Enough with the 'think global' already!
I don't think the Earth should have a say in this!
My opponent here is so old that when he went to school they didn’t even have history.
There’s a world of difference between us!
Round, schmound. The real question in this election is, "Where's Atlantis? What have you done with it?"
Going twice at $14.99.
As a fossil fuel CEO, I know hot, and as yet, you, Madam, are no Venus.
Do I hear a second for ordering the rotating base?
My opponent would like you to think he has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
... and I say the earth is flat!
Is it not now completely obvious that my opponent is full of hot air?
I feel like it’s me versus the world up here!
Stop the World. I want to get off.
Yeah, yeah sure, cry me a river.
There's no need to get so heated.
Please don't mansplain ozone depletion to me, sir
I refuse to go there.
I dare my opponent to not put spin on his comments.
As anyone can see, my opponent's reasoning is completely circular.
Indeed, my opponent holds a more global view.
Just look at the size of his lands.
Global inflation is a looming problem.
I don’t have to listen to you anymore, Mom.
It's okay, I've got the electoral college votes.
Isn't that sort of a global response?
Easy for you to criticize. You just keep turning.
You are full of hot air and it’s actually killing me.
If global warming is real then why aren't you sweating?
And I think I speak for the entire world when I say....
So maybe I shouldn't have told Atlas to shrug...
You can say "round, round" all you want but you look flat to me
I can't speak for the World, but....
My opponent makes a compelling argument, but we still maintain that Earth is flat!
My opponent simply continues circling the point in a roundabout way.
No I don't accept coal money, but you're getting warm!
Excuse me!  You’ve been getting hotter and hotter throughout this whole climate change debate!
...political chaos, pestilence, overcrowding and you've got a fever...is that what we need in a sophomore class president?
Doesn't feel that warm to me...
what makes you think you are getting warmer??
Excuse me, please don’t Earth-splain to me
Isolationist vs Globalist
Don’t you go mansplaining climate change to me.
You don't speak for everybody
You, sir, are not seeing the larger picture!"
I should know better than Earth here, I've studied climate change for ten years!
My opponent is nothing but a single-issue candidate.
Need I point out, globalism is out of control!
And I will make the Earth great again.
Now that your Antarctic ice-cap is gone, what have you done with the penguins?!
My opponent has accused me of not being 'down to earth!
My opponent simply has no worldview whatsoever
Look at my opponent, Alice, who is carrying the world on her shoulders. ALICE? Alice?
Nor will I allow the age and experience of my opponent keep me from the truth!
Isn’t it curious how my opponent’s solutions always seem to benefit mostly her?
My opponent here, thinks he holds a world view.
All right Earth, calm down. You're getting a little heated there."
Make the Americas Great Again!
And I say you DO have room for 3 billion more people!
The world has finally decided to join us in our discussion.
Even now you can't stop spinning. . .
Would you stop going in circles? Things are getting heated.
Who in the world asked for your opinion?
I concede that my opponent's arguments are supported by the weight of world opinion...
Don't get me wrong. I think the world of you!
I get it - you're a big picture guy. But, you have to consider the details.
Break into "We Are the World" and I'm outta here.
Wait! It's not my fault. I belong to the Sierra Club
you act like you're sooooo worldly
The era of what goes around comes around is over!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have earth-shattering information!
...my opponent here has connections to radical environmentalists and vegan activists!
Yes, yes, I get your not-so-subtle point, Mr Atlas.
Unlike my opponent here, I am NOT a globalist!
The world will little note nor long remember what I'm saying here.  Nevertheless, I persist.
I said it once and I'll say it again, it's not just about you!
Just because you’re more worldly does not mean you get to dominate this debate!
And now I’d like to introduce the world’s biggest Flat Earth skeptic.”
Let's give a great big welcome - to everyone!
I, on the other hand, firmly reject globalism!
Release the hot air, Sir!
I offer all speakers a bottle of water, but you’re right—it was uniquely insensitive in your case.
The world may disagree with me, but I stand firmly by my belief!
I wonder, where on earth is my opponent tonight?
Now you’re dying? You’ve been fine for a bazillion years!
Moreover, my opponent is not even a U.S. citizen!
Think of your ice caps before you let this debate get any more heated!
I would warn you about being swayed by my honourable opponent’s easily discredited  “One World” philosophy.
You're talking in circles.
I don't believe this fake news. The earth is flat!
Flat-earthers: "Fake news"
Is that all you have to offer?
Sorry, but you are flat-out wrong!
No one's looking for a revolution.
I am calling into question, my opponent's qualifications on climate change.
the whole world is ganging up on me, not fair
Yes, my opponent may be more worldly...
With that, I conclude, that Earth is in fact, flat.
We will no longer comply with the Paris Climate Accords despite the opposition!
The whole world is watching!
Wrong!
Well, "Mother" Earth, a little contraception wouldn't hurt, you know.
Obviously my opponent is feeling the heat!
Stop embarrassing me, mother!
Don't be so smug. We all have a dark side!
I'm sorry, but "The World is Not Enough".
OK, you do feel a bit warmer, but still. . .
Mr Atlas will be back in a moment!
I think I know more about global warming than you do genius
Our next speaker will be Donald Trump's ego.
My opponent  claims to be affected by Climate Change
My opponent is a globalist.
If my opponent is actually warming, burning, or on fire, wouldn't we all have seen smoke?
"I see a world of differences between my opponent and myself."
My opponent promises everything in the world.  But can he really deliver?
My opponent can't seem to stop talking in circles.
I said I'd debate the Democrats, not the entire Western Hemisphere!
There was absolutely no collusion with either continent!
First, I would like to address my opponent's claim that the earth is round...
Look who is finally warming up?
I think it's fairly obvious that I speak for everyone here...
Well, what the hell do YOU know?
My first visual aid: The earth is flat.
And contrary to the President's twitter assertion,  the world is round.
You don’t feel warmer to me.
Your circular logic has no place in this debate!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You’re getting a bit heated there, buddy.
You don’t get a say in the matter!
Just because you represent the entire world doesn’t make you right.
I assure you, you are not sick, there is no Climate change, now get back into your orbit where you belong.
Just stop! I'm getting off.
Global warming? At her age? It's clearly hot flashes.
Could you just be a little less global?
Where's Atlas you asked?
We’ll take a five minute break as Atlas goes to the bathroom.
I served with Planet Earth. I knew Planet Earth. Planet Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Planet Earth!
Are you okay? You feel hot.
Stop looking at my notes!
It's just me against you now.
When they said it'd be "me v. the world," I didn't think it would come to this.
Please don't interrupt,ma'am,I'm not done explaining the way the world works.
I have no response to my opponent's heated argument.
I'm here to tell you: I'm burning up on the inside, too!
My opponent is resorting to her usual scare tactics.
... and I intend to prove you are flat in this debate...
Yes, it’s your fault.
Without further ado, I give you Mother Earth
Now for an opposing view in our climate change debate,  from Planet Earth!
As you can see, my opponent is constantly getting hot and bothered.
You see. Flat!
You may say you are warming but the GOP is not impressed
You’re spinning my words again...all day long with you — spin, spin, spin!
Not exactly the correct answer but you're getting hotter....
My opponent wants you to believe he's not flat.
You don't have a leg to stand on in this climate change debate.
You have one minute for the rebuttal; and please don't stop spinning.
You’ve heard from the rest of the world, now it’s my turn.
In spite of mountains of evidence, my opponent  insists she’s only 2000 years old.
Shakespeare was right, all the world is a stage.
Please give a nice round of applause for our next speaker at this flat earth fact finding symposium.
Sorry, but I think your argument still falls flat.
No, I don't think it's warm in here!
He wasn't even born in America!
Climate change? You're being shrill and hysterical. That's exactly why you can't be trusted to regulate yourself.
And I happen to think that politics are local.
Shouldn't that be 'I am the world'?
I alone know the truth and the whole world is lying.
Sorry.
All my opponent cares about is herself!
I can safely say I speak on behalf of the world...
My opponent shows a clear north-south bias
We can fit the whole world on this stage, but we can’t fit all the people running for President!
Hold on there, this is a CPAC meeting, we do not care what you have to say.
I am from the Trump Administration and I say the world is flat!
Just wait a minute, you'll get your turn.
Here on Mars Today, we ask “ Earth , is there life on you “”
With all due respect Sen. Earth, how is your distribution of resources for billions greater than my need to support my business?
Oh yeah? You and what atmosphere?
My opponent here does not believe that American jobs should be our #1 priority in 2020.  Sad!
Our next speaker will discuss the benefits of gravity and why you all don't fly off into space.
My opponent thinks he’s the world authority on everything!
You claim you're feeling warmer but have you ever considered it's just a hot flash?
Of course I believe you're warming up --- especially since you dripped ice water all over half of the chairs in the Green Room!
If earth isn’t going to use all of its allotted time, I’ll continue..
And see that up there?  That used to be the United States, but their Congress allowed a narcissistic sociopath to be president.  The country is now just a blip in history.
There was NO ROTATION!
Yes, you Edith Perkins of 345 Glenn street in Boise, Idaho... your chance to rebut me.
Our next speaker wants to weigh in on the debate around the use of the word "globalist".
It's quite obvious my opponent has no plan to fight inflation.
And on this side we have the opposing view on global warming.
Feels like you are on a different planet on this issue.
My opponent here would like you to believe he’s God’s gift to the world.
Stop! As the President of the Flat Earth Society I refute your lame hypothesis.
Turns out you aren’t flat, but you’re still not warming!
As you can clearly see, my opponent is a globalist of the worst kind.
As you can see North American is barely connected to South America
My opponent will promise you the world, but does it look like he can deliver?
My opponent appears to have the weight of the world on his shoulders
You haven’t got a leg to stand on!
I'm sorry, but we're not concerned with your opinion here.
Mars, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!
Apparently you're unaware of how I destroyed Jupiter in last night's debate or you wouldn't even be here.
My opponent says she's just getting warmed up. I say that's a hoax.
See, look! You're flat!
You created the swamp!
And now let's hear from my opponent, Mother Earth.
You say you have a world of evidence, but I have my opinions...
Okay, I’ll concede that you’re round!
Cool down, you are getting a little too heated.
Why madam, you are nothing but a climate change alarmist!
You may in fact speak for the Americas, but I answer to Bezos.
. . . and that is why I don't call my opponent Mother Earth. I call her Fatty McEarthface.
I pledge to act in the best interests of the little man, whereas my opponent’s policies are clearly self-serving.
Yeah, your ego is big, but my ego is bigger. I have the best ego.
...Thank you for your input, Earth, but I’m afraid we’ll have to leave it there.
My opponent claims to care about the Earth...
I knew Europe.  Europe was a friend of mine. America - you are no Europe.
We’ll get to you later.
Global warming? Hah! You don't look so hot to me!
Atlas, come back here!
My fellow citizens, don't let my opponent continue to polarize us!
Our guest speaker will argue for the colonization of Mars
Make the world go away!
Let everyone note how you consistently change your position on the issues as you rotate.
Not your turn!
Don't fall for my opponent's circular reasoning.
You’re flat out wrong!
I’d like to teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony...
I dare you to speak with one voice.
My opponent has a world of ideas, but, will it be around long enough to deliver?
So you're saying that Al Gore doesn't deserve all the credit for the documentary either?
OK earth (if that is your real name), tell us what you know about global warming
So every 60,000,000 years or so you change. Very unreliable. So what's it's going to be this time?"
- People are not gonna buy this: a revolution every year it's not a real revolution!
I feel like we're just spinning in circles
My opponent here claims to be his own man, but in reality he's still being pushed around by the sun.
I will not feel your forehead because I absolutely do not believe global warming is real.
That’s unfair! Of course you can promise them the world!
Although you did not precisely  guess my position on climate change, you are getting warm.
... and the people will not by your "too big to fail" argument.
And, next up on ‘Hot or Not’....
My opponent is living proof that the polar regions are disappearing.
My opponent continues to argue that climate change is real.
We all think the world of you, but you can't keep hiding your dark side.
The stage is set for world domination.
Your globalist view holds no weight here!!
Ma’am, your personal problems are of no concern to the american people
Hold your ozone. Your chance to speak will be after the 2020 election.
Is it hot in here or is that just you warming?
I still have the floor, or crust, if you prefer.
Oh fuck.
I think I know a little bit more about globalization than you.
She’s well rounded, but her foreign policy is superficial at best.
I now yield to my opponent from the North, South, East and West.
And now Miss World will say a few words.
No, this isn’t what ‘America First’ means.”
No borders? Are you kidding me?
Sure, you think globally, but you sure aren't acting very locally.
Around and around we go again.
I’m sorry, but the correct spelling is P-A-N-G-E-A
Well what about the European view.
The planet wishes to be heard.
Your policies seem to be very self-serving.
I would ask my opponent to present evidence for this 'global warming'"
My opponent freely admits that she longs to return to the Stone Age.
Let earth speak for itself.
Wait, wait! I promise no more denial about climate change!
And our next speaker is Mother Earth who comes to tell us about  having too many hot flashes.
#MeToo
You need to wait your turn
Wait a minute, you'll get your turn.
My opponent is clearly trying to give this debate a hostile climate.
If my opponent didn't want us to use fossil fuels, why did she provide them to us?.
The question is why is my opponent getting so heated in his argument.
Yes, and in this election, it truly is me against the world.
And needing no introduction, it's A Small World.
In closing, remember to sign up and support MEFA on your way out. Make Earth Flat Again
Global warming is a hoax, despite what this so called ‘expert’ may have you believe!
I can also have a global perspective!
There's a world of difference between you and me.
I think the world of my esteemed opponent,but he lacks the necessary gravitas
Why should we trust you? You keep changing your climate!
I concede that the world does in fact revolve around my opponent.
Where on Earth did that idea come from?
I’m not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.
It seems to be getting a little warm in here.
What in the world do you mean?
Forgotten for so long........here she is
Mother Earth!
And with her first try at slam poetry, here’s Earth with Get the #*%€ off of me!
How’s the weather ?
Behold!  Atlas Shrugged!!!!
I'm sorry for getting so heated, but you started it.
if there are no labels,how do we know where we are?
Joining us tonight for our discussion on flat earth theory, is Round Earth.
You and your ‘global perspective’ vastly underestimate the size of my ego!
I heard you the first time ‘round
My opponent has been touting the same circular argument for less than 10,000 years!
You'll be able to see my unbelievably tremendous wall from this far away, I promise
In this debate, it is me against the world. Literally.
Try to see it from my point of view
Do you need some ice in your water?
Frank attempted to debate global warming, but the evidence was too overwhelming”..
You need to chill!
So..extinction, yes or no?
Talk about a Me vs. The World moment, am I right?
Why do you keep insisting that your self-interest trumps mine?
Contrary to my opponent, I'm here to talk about good clean coal!
Hyperbole aside, I think we can BOTH speak to the global issues facing this election
Yes, my opponent is definitely more worldly than I.
If you look very ,very carefully, you can see Fullerton, Nebraska.
My opponent will tell you he is getting warmer, but I say that is fake news.
I served for 30 years on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources-what experience do you have?!
There is no debating this; you are full of hot air
My opponent is clearly melting under this heat
Let me just say, it means the world to be here.
My opponent surely cannot shrug off the fact that he is a Globalist.
I don't see your point.
My opponent is inflating his view.
How did you get in here?
Welcome to this evening's first presidential 2020 debate
Who said you could have a say?
And standing in for Sisyphus, let me introduce the ball.
Earth, I studied Pluto. I knew Pluto. Pluto was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Pluto.
Sure. I know it doesn't look like much now. But a border here and a wall there... it'll be great!
Sheer, unmitigated, hemispherism!
I’m a middle-aged American man—
I have plenty of perspective!
Warming shwarming...what makes you an expert.
No, no - I act locally!
Surely, my opponent exaggerates.
I have no earthly idea what you're talking about.
My opponent is full of hot air about global warming.
You,re not giving us the whole picture!
...and all you’ll hear from this one is NIMBY !
I don’t care what you say, I believe you are only 5,000 years old.
So let's start from the beginning.
And here’s Atlas! Wait... Where’d he go?
Even your delivery is flat.
We’re sorry, Mr. Atlas had a scheduling conflict but in his place...
My opponent is completely exagerrating the problem of global warming.
I'm warming up to you.
And now we bring you the presidential debates, Trump vs. the Democratic candidates.
...and my opponent is obviously blowing things way out of proportion.
The voters have heard enough of your global view.
Where on earth did you get that idea?
Rolling along now to our next speaker, who needs no introduction.
And now, I present the Flat Earth Society's keynote speaker!
Will you ever stop playing that rising seas victim card?!
Sure, you speak for millions, but let’s not forget the little guy!
Pick a language and stop spinning!
Yes, but what have you done for us lately?
Hey, I'm a victim too...my air conditioning costs have doubled!
Flat, I say!
OK, Defend yourself!
And now...may I introduce the elephant in the room...
I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen but ICE just took Atlas away.”
Welcome to the Flat Earther Debate Finals
And for our next TED talk...
The discussion is getting quite heated from your side.
All the World's a Stage - Well!
Wait a minute! I thought I was debating Ocasio-Cortez.
Our next speaker has the audacity to think she can change the world.
When this next speaker turns around, he really makes my day.
In the interest of hearing from the WHOLE world, we will now hear from French Polynesia.
Sir, I object to your use of "We Are the World" for your campaign commercials.
Where's your birth certificate? I'm not buying that God created the heavens and the earth fake news.
And that’s my position even if the whole world thinks I’m crazy!
Gee wiz, what are we standing on?
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?
It's obvious that my opponent is full of hot air.
You only represent the special interests!
Yes comrades, it's us against the world!
Our speaker has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Let me be the first to say, I care about your problems. But -
That's fake news from the failing New York Times.  My opponent is flat and getting colder.
We know you’ll think the world of next speaker.
In my opinion, the speaker has a clear bias on the topic of climate change.
And may I introduce to you the best scientific expert in the world, Mother Earth!
I did reserve the right to say; "I want to get off."
On this global issue, the world will speak
You make a very well rounded arguement
And now in celebration of Earth Day, I give you...
One of those tiny dots in the middle might be Puerto Rico,it's hard to find and surrounded by water and far away.No collusion!
And I alone can fix it
Yes, I understand that my opponent has a world of knowledge but.....
Please. Just speak one at a time.
I know more about anything than anyone! And I certainly know more about so called global warming than you!
I contend that the advanced age of my opponent renders her unfit for world leadership.
Why am I always up against the world?
"Not only does my globalist friend want no border wall, he doesn't even want borders."
I think the American people have the right to know about your allegiance to foreign countries.
Who are you going to believe?
A whimper? That's your closing argument?
The whole world is watching but hasn't yet said a word.
OK, I admit you're not flat, but you're still small.
Tell me again why people in Australia don’t know they are upside down!
No, you’re the one full of hot air!
Your scare tactics aren't working.
You were flatter in your profile picture.
Seems the world shrugged Atlas
Excuse me, but the Americas are not the only continents on the planet!
Well, there’s really no room for debate.
Somehow the continents separated from one another, if you catch my drift.
No wonder Atlas got tired of carrying you on his back.
So, what's your stance on climate change?
The debate pitted Harry against the world.
You're so US-centric!
My opponent has no plans for the future.
Who do you think you are?
What about your affairs?
Let me guess, it’s gonna be ‘uge.
I only need $275 trillion to build a wall around it to keep out global warming!
The voters should note:  my opponent is only showing his best face to the audience!
Behold, my opponent’s distorted view of the world .
"The people need someone who won't  just turn the other hemisphere when things get rough.
Ahh, what do YOU know?
My opponent clearly can't see the gravity of the situation.
Don't believe my opponent's hot-headed ideas about climate change.
I hear you, I hear you...but buying plastic water bottles is just too convenient
Frankly, that argument falls flat.
There you go again.
Are you better off than you were four years ago?
He's a down-to-guy kind of earth.
In conclusion, my learned opponent's claim that she is feeling 'warmer' is patently false.
Mother Earth waits for her turn to speak at an Anti-Climate Change Conference
It's a costume! Don't be fooled. It's all flat underneath.
In conclusion, all the evidence clearly establishes that the earth is flat.
Alrighty, everyone. The next speaker will be on overpopulation, pollution, and politics.
Im not the sun. Stop rotating.
My opponent is clearly orbiting around the issue here.
We get it !    You have a World-view of politics
...Now, the whole world may not like my opinion, but hear me out!
Nevertheless, your world-view is reductive.
Not only is there no global warming, but as you can plainly see, the world is flat!
Donald embarrasses himself once again on the world stage.
I won’t debate global warming with your Down Under in my face.
Ha! You think you know more about climate change?
Yeah, like, that's like your world view, man.
And really, instead of blaming others, it's time you took responsibility for your situation"
Objection! the question is out of orbit and without spin.
Despite my Mother's naivete, it is money that makes the world go 'round.
My opponent occupies an alternate universe.
Folks, I know some of you won't believe how fast our next speaker was able to warm up!
Those dots in the middle are called islands.  They're underwater now.
My opponent is somewhere out there trying to prove that he has a world view."
Your evidence for whether you speak for the whole world is flimsy at best, sir!
The Flat Earth Debating Society has an invited guest speaker!
The poles show a 30 percent loss.
Please help me welcome our next guest, a personal favorite of mine, and I think you'll agree, one of the top hemispheres of all time!
And if there is someone who knows a thing or two about global warming it is Earth.
Nobody listens to you!
But what are your domestic positions?
I'd like to start off by saying my opponent is a flat out liar.
Just because you’re the whole world it doesn’t make you right.
Who invited you?
Looks flat to me.
And my ancestors lived in the upper left tip of earth back when it was habitable.
As my esteemed colleague just found out, never turn your back on the Americas.”
We'll have to put your issues on hold for the moment. Now, how about we discuss gerrymandering?
There can be no debate here sir... You are indeed round!
Our extinction may well be at hand, but there was no collusion!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to buy into all this global warming stuff based on a single opinion.
And now, a rebuttal to the Flat Earth argument.
Nice of the Earth to show up this evening. Especially with the ALLEGED reports that she’s dying. Fake news!
Up next is Mother Earth. She’s here to testify about women’s rights.
Stop treating the space program like a personal affront!
You’re just another globalist!
I  will lower my temper when you lower your temperature
At least we saved a life size model of our planet since it's too late to save the real thing.
well, we put a wall there, a beautiful barrier there, a fence...
Apparently my opponent cannot carry the weight of the world on his shoulders after all.
This just proves that it's a world wide conspiracy.
When I said Global Warming is not real it was not for debate!
Mother Earth, you can't just argue that I'm a man and therefore I wouldn't understand.
Nonetheless, the entire planet is still only entitled to a 90 second rebuttal.
How about a big round of applause for our next speaker?
Your arguments for globalism are a bit too self-centered.
You might represent the entire planet, but I can run circles around you in this debate.
My opponent will have you believe that the world is not flat.
I served with Carl Sagan. I knew Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan was a friend of mine. Earth, you are no Carl Sagan.
Yes, but do you have any actual proof that climate change is real?
Just keep your center of gravity
The time has come to change up the Miss World competition
I don't care what you say, I still think you're flat!
To make the case against eating more sardines, I now turn to my opponent, the Pacific Ocean.
And my opponent - I call him "whiny world" - can't even tolerate a few extra degrees of heat....  Hey "genius globe" - ever hear of air conditioning?
For the last time - No! It's not getting warmer in here!
My opponent, Atlas, couldn’t even bother to show up!
My opponent's world view is clearly 'America First'.
Global perspective? My socks are Chinese and my call girls are Brazilian, sir.
Atlas shrugged.
As you can clearly see, ladies and gentlemen, we need LOTS of walls!
I know the world revolves around you, but please wait your turn.
About time you stopped spinning.
My opponent may well believe that she's warming, but has she considered whether it might just be psychosomatic?
Folk, it's you and me against my opponent here.
Closer, closer...okay...stop! Stop!
I served with Planet Earth. I knew Planet Earth. Planet Earth was a friend of mine. Globe, you’re no Planet Earth.
And,I am happy to present our next speaker:  The World at Large.
Just cause you're hot doesn't mean Global Warming is real.
Look, I regret it happened, OK? But, who needs all that coral, anyway?
Even at this distance I don't feel you're any warmer.
You've made your point , but continuing to blame us will not solve the problem, will it.
Obviously, my opponent is guilty of self-aggrandizing
My opponent has a one-sided view of the world!
My next guest is here to present her earth-shattering paper, ‘The reports of my flatness have been greatly exaggerated’
My opponent has his head in the clouds!
Well I’ve been around the block a couple of times too, y’know.
Nobody cares if you're more respected on the world stage...I had a reality TV show
Okay,Okay, Climate change is real!!
I didn’t realize my opponent would be speaking for herself.
So, you deny you’re getting warmer?
First you whined about the ozone layer, now it's climate change - what's next, disappearing rain forests?
And I say if Earth Day were a real holiday, we’d get the following Monday off!
Although my opponent is more worldly, I can see she's heating up right now!
What are you hiding? Show us your birth certificate!
My opponent would like you to think he carries the world on his shoulders.
Cool down, Earth. Climate change's a hoax.
Before we continue our debate on Climate Change... can you please provide a long form birth certificate?
And now Earth's response...
Hold it right there. Asia and Australia won the coin toss fair and square."
So turn on the air conditioner like everybody else!
Don't be such a hot head!
I'm not impressed with your world view!
I didn't mean it.
It's about time you stood up for yourself!
So that's your take on the world view?
now, we will hear from "Mother Earth" as she gives her point of view on the so-called "Climate Change" matter
Moving South America east
we can stop global warming.
That may be your opinion, but I still say you are flat!
Who are you going to believe? Me, or her?
I will not cave into the intimidation of globalists!
Earth: To the climate change deniers. Haha! So funny! You guys are killing me! No. I mean it. Literally. You ARE killing me.
I’m sorry, madam, but you’ve had your turn and you’re out of time.
Flat, flat, flat—end of debate!
And now, mother earth on her story on "How I survived in spite  of your abuse.
Here.s the latest Banana Republic. Let’s welcome the United States of America
What would you know about global warming?
This man is a phony! The real Earth is flat!
I understand you've prepared a eulogy for the human race.
The plan speaks for itself.  Protect our Northern border.  Move the Great Lakes!
Yeah, and what about Asia?
Enough with the earthsplaining.
I'd like to introduce today's speaker on the topic, "What to do when people call you flat."
My opponent is not a scientist and has no basis for discussing climate change
While my opponent may better portray the populous at large, I would like to point out that I am rich.
The last thing we'd want is world dominance!
My opponent thinks she knows so much about global warming!
My opponent is just another globalist.
From where I stand your climate seems fine.
I'll admit that my opponent has delivered on some of her promises...
I'm just saying that my comments regarding my opponent getting hotter were taken out of context.
There is no such thing as global warming even if the whole world disagrees.
Oh, sure! You’ve ‘changed’...
And presenting the case against climate change ...
“There you go again blaming everyone but yourself.”
Did it ever occur to you that it could just be global hot flashes?
You're not so hot.
It still looks pretty flat to me!
My opponent may be heated, but I'm not convinced it's global warming...
And now a word from our next speaker on climate change: The Planet
Listen to him, he just goes round and round...
And that's what it looked like before it burned up.
I'm sorry to say, but my debate opponent hasn't been able to withstand the pressures of the world.
So, our presentation for today: the earth is not flat. Any questions?
So you think you can be a star
And now the Americas will have their say.
Let’s keep it real, no one cares that much about you.
My opponent always complains about carrying the weight of the world.
And now I turn the podium over to the Pacific Ocean which will present thoughts of it’s global dominance of Earth’s surface area.
I will not tolerate your circular arguments!
You haven't much time. Better make it bruef.
"You're entire argument is an ad hominem."
I don't care which side you're on!
No collusion!  I swear!
There she goes again, always complaining about how warm it feels in here.
I, for one, am not aligned with your world view.
I know you're on a roll, but.....
And it makes a certain amount of sense that the world would finally ask for equal time...
Climate Change? Ha! Show me the evidence.
And now, live on our stage here at the EPA, and speaking for herself, a very angry WORLD
And finally, where in the world is my opponent?
Here's what's happened because I didn't get my fence.
Excuse me Mr. President, but I can speak for myself.
Who on earth are you?
When the earth was flat we had none of the problems we have now. If you ventured astray, you just fell off.
It's now the planet's turn.
Meanwhile, my opponent has referred to our entire species as ‘A basket of deplorables’!
My opponent's is a very one sided globalist perspective.
Is it warm in here?
yeah? well you're fat
Ok fine maybe you're not flat, but vaccines will definitely still give you autism"
I know worlds. I have the best worlds!
.....and that’s how far my inaugural crowd extended.
Okay! Okay! Hold your water!
I guess this really is the world stage
Excuse me, I'm talking!
I beg your pardon, but the galaxy doesn't care.
Name the missing lake
I will not uphold the world view.”
I'm not too old to debate you; I'm just warming up.
How did you fit through the door anyway?
See — it's flat!
To my left on this side of the dais we have the current champion.
How does it make you feel when people say they want to change you?
I’ll say it again: ‘flat’.
My colleague and I are a universe apart on this point.
You’re just pandering to your base!
We've brought the world into the classroom to speak to you directly.
You are too subjective about climate change.
It’s ‘All the world’s a stage’ not, ‘All the stage’s a world’!
I  suppose you have something to say about global warming !!
I would like to address my comments to North America. No offense to you South America.
Don't be fooled by my opponent that "Size matters".
I mention "Hot Topic's" and you come rolling in !
Atlas Shrugged, ladies and gentlemen"
Western hemisphere...you ignorant slut!
And you really expect us to believe you’re not flat?
You’re only in it for yourself.
what your saying makes a world of difference
He's just a puppet for a special interest group, his 7.5 billion constituents.
I don't care what you say, climate change is a hoax.
Offering her rebuttal in the climate change debate, we welcome to the stage... Mother Earth!
I 'd like to introduce the ultimate expert on global warming, The Earth!
Says you...
Just be patient. Atlas has a bit of a bladder problem.
And here's a shout-out to my family in Des Moines
Yeah, Atlas, just walk away and leave her to the rest of us ...
My opponent will selfishly ask you to make him better.
Planet, I served with Jupiter. I knew Jupiter. Jupiter was a friend of mine. Planet, you’re no Jupiter!
I am not adjusting the thermostat to accommodate your menopause.
Hypochondriac!
Your presentation here today means the world to us.
And what exactly have YOU done for us lately?
Another self-centered remark from my opponent, always thinking globally!
And now, our special guest would like to discuss 
Armageddon and why it should happen now.
Ask yourself, why hasn't Earth released its long form brith certificate?
I will not make age an issue. I am not going to exploit my opponent's age and uncountable antiquations.
Is my opponent prepared tonight to admit that they have another hidden side to their identity?
Look. there are still so many places to build Border Walls
My opponent has no experience in government and is deluded by all the fake science supporting the global warming hoax.  And he's fat.
I STILL say that my opponent is FLAT!
What planet are you on?!
And just why is it we should allow you to make your problems ours?
I propose we vote U.S. off the planet
Things are really heating up in this debate.
I'm feeling anything but global warming from you.
That may be so, but what about the Eastern Hemisphere?
I challenge my opponent to produce her long-form Hawaiian birth certificate!
This is a tad bigger than that proverbial  elephant in the room.
My client, the former planet known as Pluto is requesting damages from the defendant....
STOP! I DON'T ACTUALLY CONSIDER MYSELF THE CENTER OF UNIVERSE.
My fellow citizens, clearly my opponent is not the actual planet Earth; for if that were the case, I then ask you: where are we holding this debate?
...my intelligence is not up for debate sir. Nor my ability see. The Flat Earth Society rejects your claims of roundness...
Just you wait, my opponent will come around.
You seem a little arrogant, do you think the world of  yourself?
There you go again. Blowing even hotter air than last time we met.
Still alive, this year’s life achievement award goes to...
While Mr. Blue Planet would shackle your economic freedom
My next guest needs no subduction.
My opponent has a long history of 
only circling the larger issues.
Before long, things will completely turn for you
Excuse me! I have the floor.
Enough with the hemispherics!
Quit changing the clima... er,uh,subject!
And your questions about it's health...I'm going to let earth speak for itself.
I know this is a debate, but you have to stop getting so heated!
If we elect this guy we are in for a world of hurt!
I pledge to bring back the borders
This is not my middle finger.
Let me guess.  Location, Location, Location."
Care to spin around and show us your poorer side?
This was meant to be a tempered debate. Stop getting so heated.
I can fix this and upper Mongolia will pay for it!
How can you not recognize the global dimensions of the problem?
I’m gonna build a wall!
My opponent claims to have the whole world in his hands. Maybe he underestimated.
Not now, Mother. I'm trying to sell these fine folks a border wall.
Stop Right There!  YOU don't believe in global warming?
And we've had it up to here with those volcanoes.
No! I will not be intimidated by globalization anymore.
Now that we've seen the satellite photo of the Great Wall of China, here's what The Trump wall looks like from the same distance.
Globalism isn't as big as you think
Even more evidence that Atlas dropped the ball.
.......and my opponent's presents a view that only shows a New World perspective".
And now, to give an opposing view on the question of global warming...
My oponent thinks she knows something about climate change.
No no no! Only from there to there will be great again.
Yeah, when you can't think of anything better to say it's always, "Global Warming this and Global Warming that"
If you're going to be like that, we'll just move to Planet B.
I, Donald tRump, call this global warming garbage FAKE News!  I’ll say it right to your face!
We present to you the finest speaker on the planet to talk to you on climate change.
I don’t care if the earth rolled over him, my two minutes aren’t up yet!
I’mBlue; I’m hot; and I won’t be ignored
As you can see,there is no wall there anywhere!  If God wanted a wall there, he would have put a wall!
Just goes to show you can't always trust your Global Positioning System
And just what have you ever done for the people?
I deny that!
‘The Americas this, the Americas that’ - I’ve had it with your Western Hemisphere-centrism!
We warned you the camera would add ten pounds!
My title for this lecture is "The Rise of Globalism"
Excuse me sir! I will continue to oppose your unabashedly globalist views, and I dispute that you have the weight of the world behind them!
No, you're NOT warming.  And what do you mean, "This isn't a debate"?
I begin my argument with an extraterrestrial world view.
Well if you can warm up, so can I.
If I even mention climate change, you get all heated.
this debate makes a world of difference.
Is anybody listening?
This debate is getting very heated
''HERE IT IS FOLKS!  LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!"
I don't care if the world is against me. I shall prevail!
Where not here to talk about your personal issues, ma'am.
My opponent seems to think global warming is the only issue of interest here.
Our guest lecturer will be discussing global warming.
Oh yeah ... well, you're fat.
What on earth are you saying ?!
Our next speaker needs no introduction.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Everybody.
You may have all the time in the world, but I need 30 seconds for a rebuttal.
Tonight, we are here to debate our world view.
Contrary to popular belief, the world is not getting smaller.
And now for an opposing view
Stop hovering, you creep.
My opponent’s lying! Promising the world? Just look at him!
How long we have endured, the spin from the other side.
There he goes. Throwing his weight around again.
And now, the most recent addition to the Democratic Party's
primary, Gaia!
You never hear Mars complaining like this!
Get a load of ol' "Low Energy Earth," over there.
I still say you're flat, and you don't feel any warmer than you did the last time we met.
Give it up. The whole world is against you.
It's always on a macro level with you.
As you can see, our distinguished guest is having hot flashes.
I think we'd all like to hear from your better half.
My opponent, who takes a broader view...
I realize I may be alone with my opinion on this issue."
I know that you're a big advocate for No More Humans, but you'll have to wait to speak like everyone else
Raymond's worldly opinion of himself before the debate was short lived.
With all due respect, you're in no condition for the job.
I prefer to remind my esteemed opponent that props are not permitted in formal debate.
As a representative of the oil industry, let me repeat: we won’t be intimidated!
I've found my opponent lacks perspective."
Do you have proof of these outlandish claims?
That's the planet we escaped from.
I will prove that global warming is a hoax despite my opponent's hot-headed arguments to the contrary!
We're giving each of the seven and a half billion speakers five minutes, then we'll open the cocktail party.
Don't turn your back on me!
Does my opponent agree that there are two sides to every story?
Please hold your applause as this tends to start rolling.
Our next speaker has a real earthy sense of humor.
Why should you be the one determine the correct thermostat setting?!
Vote for ME!  
I am the only candidate willing to take on the WORLD!
I'm a proud nationalist!  Can my opponent say the same?
Before I begin my talk, I want to thank my staff  for this terrific visual aid.
I'd rather talk about unemployment.
Neither charm nor gravity will make me take your side!
My opponent says he's "warming." I say, that's HIS problem.
And now, a representative of the Earth has asked to say a few words about global warming, pollution, and basic lack of respect.
That "Atlas Shrugged" story is getting pretty old!
Stop right there - talk to the hand!
I'd like to point out that my party's constituants own, or otherwise directly control, ninety-eight percent of my opponent.
Clearly, my opponent cannot carry the weight of the world on his shoulders
Where's my wall?!?
Fake news!
You can't prove it!
And you cast out poor Pluto, who was so small, weak and frail
Your argument is flat sir, and so are you!
How can we believe that you speak on behalf of everyone?
Uh, woah there! When we promised you a global presence, this wasn't exactly what he had in mind.
Hold on Atlas!
My opponent, Mother Earth, is a bully, just like all climate alarmists!
Well, from here you look pretty darn flat to me!
My opponent considers himself worldly!
Please tell us how Climate Change is affecting you.
Sir, do you mind? I’m just as interested in climate change as you.
I think it's just the stage lights. You're not actually warming.
I can see our debate from here!
Mother Earth, may I call you 'Mom'? You've heard all sides of the climate change debate. We'd like to hear from you. Speak up, Mom.
Hah! You call me a gas bag?
Ask not what the world can do for you!
Yes, but can you really prove it was HUMAN activity that caused your warming?
I shall defend the use of fossil fuels even though the whole world oppose me.
He's not letting me get a world in edgewise.
My opponent cannot prove it is round!
My opponent recently confided that she IS feeling a bit warmer.
You may have the science, but we've got Trump!"
The victim card is the only thing my opponent knows to play.
I am an expert on global warming, so please wait your turn before weighing in on the issue.
As my worthy opponent knows, This problem is bigger than both of us!
I don't think you're big enough to matter.
My opponent would like to build a wall to keep Pluto out...
Yes ever since the Panama Canal, South America has been drifting east.
No. I said, ‘Please be more SPECIFIC. ‘
My colleague here appears to be getting hot under the collar, despite my reasonable argument in this debate that there is no scientific  evidence of climate change.
My opponent makes unsubstantiated claims of global warming. We all know she is just having hot flashes!
What in the world are you doing here?!!
Yes, we think life is possible on Planet Earth, but understandably, very low intelligence.
See ladies and gents!
The "Lie-entists" were wrong again. 
It's perfectly flat, like "Plate-O" said.
And, right at the geometric center.....
Mar-El-Lago!
What're you gonna do? Flatten me?
My opponent continues to duck questions on domestic issues.
Man V. World
_I move to recess until Mr.Atlas resolves his egregious theatrics.
My opponent is not taking the bigger picture into account!
The earth speaks and no one listens.
You say 'global warming,'  but what do you really know about it.
Just stopped in to issue a global warning
This is what it looked like before it went flat.
That’s my opponent...always spinning.
I ask you - who are you going to believe?
And my opponent just fell into the Pacific!
And yet my opponent promised to drain the swamps!
If we can just capture what the earth is trying to tell us.....
My opponent is NOT being transparent concerning global warming - he's only showing half of the story!
Just water weight?  Talk about spinning the truth!
I have been wrongfully accused by the Fake News of “trashing” my opponent
It’s a hoax! Last summer my opponent didn’t even have ice on her forehead!
As Tupac once said: “it’s Me Against the World.”
Welcome to tonight's discussion on climate change.
The only thing getting heated is this debate!
My friend Atlas here apparently got tired!
I'm not here to chit chat about the weather.
Hold on now, that's a lot to put on my shoulders.
And yet you stand there silent!
My opponent would have you believe she  feels the pain of global warming more then I do?
I'm warning you!
And now we will from a source that has a vested interest in Global Warming,
I'd just like to point out that you are letting Easter Island speak for an awful lot of people.
My opponent claims to be from the Western Hemisphere.....I ask you where’s the proof?
And what would you know about global warming?
Stop the World, I wanna get...no, right, I’m already off.
We are worlds apart on this issue.  Let’s just agree to disagree.
Just because you’re my mother!
Global inflation is getting out of hand.
This Pacific point my opponent raises is a good one.
I know the whole world says I'm wrong, but I say I'm right
No, I’m not mansplaining.
And I am indeed ready to take on the world."
John Canning
Sea Cliff, NY
You seem very worldly, what's your opinion on global warming?
We knew something would render Trump non-existent.  And it was there all  this time.
It's about time you weighed in on global warming!
You need to chill out.
Earth, you're no Jack Kennedy.
I did say I was ready to take on the whole world, but could I go to the bathroom first?
The president indicated you were flat.
Bah to your preponderance of proof!  You'll never convince me you're not flat!
I know a thing or two about the world too, you know.
I told you that unlike myself, Senator Atlas would crumble under the additional weight of his presidential candidacy.
I don't care what the world says. I have all the answers.
I’m the best president ever! The world’s all wrong and I’m always right!
Your World View and mine are definitely different.
It's starting to feel warm in here.
Damn you, Atlas!
No, it’s not caused by CO2 emissions. It’s the house lights.”
Can you be more specific?
My view is quite different
Sure, I may not be the most worldly candidate.
Unlike my opponent I have a world view.
Mother Earth, do you believe Climate Change is a hoax?
And I say you're not warming. I guess it's my word against yours.
What on earth would you have me do?!
From day one, my opponent has done everything in his power to conceal his ties to Russia.
Mother Earth wouldn't even be in the presidential arena if she weren't a woman.
Whoa... easy there big fella.... let me introduce you first !
your position simply does not hold water
Alright, let's put a pin in it.
...and my ever-vacationing opponent is even now somewhere in the Pacific.
My opponent brings a behemothic ego to the debate.
My opponent here seems to think science is a thing!
All I said was we deserve better than Uranus.
While my opponent may be more worldly, my spin is that politics is local.
Don’t even go there! I was eco-friendly before they invented the word.
My response to you is that you are full of hot air!
Addressing the Elephant in the Room...
Atlas I knew you would never hold up
So, why is it still snowing then?
Don't give us that face. Everyone knows you've been warming up to China.
Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!
Give me a podium, and I will move the world!
My next guest is here to discuss global warming. 
Let's give a warm welcome to Earth.
I’ll concede my opponent has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Oh yeah?!  Well I‘ve got Wisconsin
...and I still have more Twitter followers!
You say we have to think globally...I say we must act locally.
My opponent is obviously a member of the globalist left.
Will you stop your whining. What did you think? You would live forever?
Plainly, my opponent thinks it speaks for everyone.
What is your opinion on global warming?
Your answer to my question is still wrong, but you are getting a little warmer.
I knew the world and you are no world!
It's been said that I'm at odds with the world.
See this pin?    Lighten up.
I’d like to ask my opponent if they have ever been to Hell, and if they in fact own a hand basket.
and now for the majority opinion...
My opponent clearly knows nothing of worldly affairs.
And in closing I ask: Do mothers always know best?
Wait one revolution now!
What do you mean, EVERYBODY says so?
You shift positions so much you’re practically spinning
Want a Coke? Then show me you can sing in perfect harmony!
World debating championship
That’s just your opinion
There you go, getting all hot and steamy again!
Thanks Al, I’ll take this one
It’s obvious that my opponent is not well- rounded.
Accepting the award for best known solar system in the galaxy...
What would you like to say to all these people putting trash into you?
This is a science convention.  There is no need for your worldview.
Yes, I Donald J. Trump, know better. My gut says so...
How can you, of all people, deny global warming?
easy...I was just kidding about global warming being fake news...
And my opponent would have us all return to the Cenozoic Era.
...additionally, my opponent has done nothing to stop global warming.
I think the world of my esteemed opponent, however...
We will secure our borders from climate change too
Oh ... just cool it!
What? YOU?!
YOU  have NO Say in this!
Shut up and SIT Down!
I've invited my next guest to talk about it's next revolution
And NOW, with a medley of tunes from South Pacific..
Your perspective is too broad.
Enough with the climate change!
Is it getting hot in here?
Ok, so maybe my opponent IS round after all. But there's still no consensus on his ‘global warming’ claim!
And arguing the "against" position in today's debate, please welcome Senator Mitch McConnell.
Please shut off your phones and GPS devices.
And now let me introduce my very dear,old friend without whom I certainly would not be here tonight.
I know the Earth and you are not her, ma'am.
Do not be dissuaded by my opponent's OverHeated rhetoric!
You think you’re so great.
If you can wait a minute I believe that I have the lever that works with that fulcrum.
We are the last two candidates and the choice is clear.
My opponent can't even sit still.
You want a whole day?? How would we pay for it?
Since three quarters of you is water, I’d hardly say that you represent the ‘entire planet.’
As parliamentarian of the Flat Earth Society, you, sir, are very much out of order.
I don't care what the World says, global warming is a hoax!
Okay, you win, global warming is a real thing!
If you cant stand the heat you need to stay out of politics!"
Oh yeh, keep blabbering about YOUR molten core!
Wait, wait, let me finish.
It's like I have the weight of the world going against me!
I know you're passionate, Mom, but you have to sit in the audience!
And I suppose you are going to take a world view on this issue
There- right there is where the wall will be if you vote for me.
COME DOWN HERE AND DEBATE ME LIKE A MAN.
My opponent, Mr. World, will try to say that it's all gloom and doom ahead.
The new dwarf planet, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.0167, will now take questions.
The Flat Earth Society vehemently objects to your characterization of our position as being 'anti-Pythagorus.'
As you can see, it is a disk, and therefore flat.
I would now like to address all the "fake news" being generated my opponent.
Even though you think you're round, my supporters and I know you are fat. . .I mean flat.
The planet has something to say.
Our next guest is a world-renowned geologist
Believe me, you're no Jack Kennedy
Thank you for stopping by on your global health tour, and we appreciate your tip on retaining water.
'Mother, I promise you'll have the last word'
You think you're the whole world, but you're not. Tierra del Fuego is missing.
No need to get overheated, it's a long campaign.
What do you mean another universe has adopted you?
Whoa! Back up there! If you can't stand the heat ...
I understand we’re on a global stage, but it’s just your opinion.
Look, lady, I have just as much experience and knowledge about climate change.
Okay, what on Earth happened to the other speaker?
Oh stop it and just cool down will you.
My opponent just told you a world of lies!
And now, here to discuss the climate crisis, we have the Western Hemisphere.  The East will appear tomorrow and for many days thereafter.
Our next speaker for Earth Day, is the Earth y'all!
If you’re down here, then who’s up there?”
You're way too down to Earth.
Mind if I smoke?
...and the world has spoken!
Contrary to what some may claim or believe, the world is in fact round. I present to you Exhibit A.
There is no debate. Make Earth Great Again!
And I say, cargo shorts are a timeless classic!
My opponent claims to know a whole world about climate change.
I said wall, not ball!
You DON'T represent the global community!  Can you even spell, 'Herzegovina'?  I CAN!!"
Meanwhile he just spins around, gravitating toward any hot, shiny thing in the sky.
Again, I'll restate my position. The evidence isn't yet conclusive."
Me against the World  and I still say you're flat.
When it comes to climate change, it’s me against the world.!
Earth, heal thyself!
Now for someone who speaks for a lot of us, I'm sure...
From now on, America first!
And no booing, just because our next speaker believes in climate change.
That’s weather, not climate!
It's hard being the down-to-earth candidate
Hang on, I'm going to get Jupiter.
Ned surprised everyone with his earthy sense of humor.
There’s more to debate than which candidate has the most gravitas!
THEY say the earth is flat and I believe they are correct.
and, ladies and gentleman, here to answer your questions about global warming, is, er , the globe.
And to prove the earth is flat, I brought the impostor herself.
Oh, so I suppose you think this make you an expect on climate change."
My opponent may lead you to believe that she's big and mighty, but when you go to the polls, you must remember: It's a small world, after all.
Not being able to speak about climate change made The World even hotter under the collar.
Ask yourself, how can you trust my opponent who has killed billions of innocents throughout history?
Now let's draw lines.
I see that my time has expired.
Do you have anything you'd like to say before we decide?
We know you're coming to an end but can you wait so we can film it?
I'm pleased to introduce our newest democratic candidate with a can-do attitude and getting warmer every day...
No rolling over just to make a point.
Wait a minute! You're not the only one to have a global approach.
Yes sir, I do believe I am more important than you and all of your inhabitants.
See?  It's always all about him!
Loser"
Get Man to Mars! That’s your answer to everything!
No, no!  Flat, flat, flat!
There you go again Mother Earth. I may be sleazy, but that's not where I was coming from when I said you were hot.
The Earth is really flat I tell you......FAKE NEWS!!
Oh, it's always about you, isn't it, Mr Global Warming.
Melvin joins the Flat Earth debate
The world has its way of doing things, and I have my way. The world makes Hurricanes to destroy and kill, while I make Hurricanes with lots of rum.
It's just the world against me!
So stop getting so overheated, already!
This position calls for someone with more stability than you and your incessant climate change can offer.
I don't doubt that you may have been molested. But the statute of limitations. . .
Some say the planet is telling us we are causing it to overheat. We are going to debate that today.
I heard I was competing against a world class debater!
Very nice! Now turn and show Europe.
My opponent will try and tell you she isn't flat and that she has a fever.
May I point  out that my opponent may be geographically sound but he remains geologically in constant flux.
Can you chill out please!
My opponent—now in its 4.5 billionth year—is Exhibit A for term limits.
Taking on the world? No, you're taking on Mortie Applebaum.
My opponent has abandonded the simple modesty of cloud cover, is no longer spinning about any meaningful axis, has deserted his loving moon and solar siblings, and his butt is permanently parked on top of Australia.  He is a small shadow of his past.
With that, I am done ... and the only thing standing between you and lunch is The World.
Sisyphus, I know you can hear me. Back off!
Debating Trump in this debate -the world.
Apparently, the 800lb gorilla in the room has something to say....."
I call on my opponent to stick to the issues.
We can't trust you to not rotate your view.
Of course the world is round, but this proves it is not a globe.
May I introduce you to Mr. Splat, who some of you knew as Atlas.
We invited people here to talk about the planet. Not the planet to talk about people.
And, our next speaker is
Hemi Sphere.”
I'm just warming up, so you can stop right there.
That's fine for you, but what about Africa? And Europe! And Asia! And Greenland! And Antarctica! Yeah! What about Antarctica?
Excuse me Mother, but my opinion on global warming is JUST as important as yours
And my opponent just goes on and on and on."
If my opponent is scaring you, he's just warming up.
This is a global warning!
I will not be intimidated into accepting man-made climate change.
The Earth would like to say a couple of words to Mankind."

"You're Screwed!
Again, my opponent Earth exaggerates. Global Warming is a myth.
I will not be intimidated!
You are a hoax!
ATLAS! ATLAS! Oh Atlas...
What my opponent just said is pure geocentric poppycock.
Power Point is so passé
And now, with a rebuttal . . .
It's true, I think the world of you.
I am not short! I am just more down to earth than most people!
You are so flat!
My opponent is taking a one-sided view of this global challenge.
How do you know global warming exists?
My opponent would lead you to believe that he has taken a world view, but it is clear to see that he has drawn Alaska incorrectly.
Don’t you stare at me like that!
No one knows more about the planet than I do.
Quit bullying us with floods, hurricanes and tornadoes! Carbon emissions are not the problem. You are!
If you listen closely to the rhetoric, you can almost feel the weight of the world upon you.
No, it's not getting warm in here.
My opponent only tells the truth when it's convenient for her.
.... and you should be able to tell that I think the world of my opponent.
Join me in holding my opponent responsible for the mess we're in.
...and now, Mother Earth is here to lecture us on climate change.
Until today, folks, we've had to guess what our planet really needs......
the world owes me, and I demand an answer
So, you think you know more about climate change? Think again.
No Climate Change! Who ya gonna believe, Me, your favorite 
Pres ever, or Fat fake Blue Boy over there?
You say "turtles all the way down" but you have no legs to stand on.
Just answer the question Mother Earth, when will you release your taxes?
If elected I promise to investigate why my opponent is no longer FLAT!
Just let me make this one Archimedean point.
Do you feel that Global Warming is overblown?
I'm just the man to take on the world.
As an atheist I challenged God to be here for a debate, He couldn't make it but sent proof He exists.
The people can't trust you on climate change—you're a biased party!
Even the Earth, the 2018 Debate World Champion, can not negate Climate Change
What proof does my opponent here really have about global warming?
So who are you going to believe? Me or them?
Another one of my opponent’s dirty tricks - he’s trying to convince you that all of America is against me!!
The people deserve a leader who can stay cool under pressure!
...and I expect all of you to pay for your share of the Wall!
If your temperature goes up a mere 2.8 degrees centigrade you call it a disaster! Even I can handle that! What a wimp!
Henderson never stood a chance at the Globalization debate.
With all due respect, senator, where I come from it is not a crime to think locally."
And now, from the other side of the aisle, let's hear from someone speaking on the effects of climate change.
We couldn't decide who to invite to speak so we invited the whole world
I still choose to BELIEVE the Earth is flat.
If you're truly who you say you are, then where does that leave us?
Global warming is not real — my opponent is just a hypochondriac
I do think the world of you.
In a word, this next speaker is worldly.
Speak for yourself!
Can we stick to one topic?
The world may not agree with me about climate change....
Yeah well, speaking for myself.
And who is this 'source' that will back these outrageous claims?
Fake views!
Her argument that climate change is real is totally biased.
See...he just talks in big circles
That may very well be true, but tell me this - how many Twitter followers do YOU have?
Being 'down to earth' doesn't make him right.
Our tax cuts should be trickling down to you any day now
And you see Dora the Explora now is approaching the Orinoco
Calling us stupid doesn’t help.
What do you know?  You’re mostly covered by water!
Forget the wall - build a canal!
Quit melting down! Think about the economy.
And here, to make Wittgenstein's point, is the world.
Told you I wasn't flat!
I don’t believe in global bullying!
There you go again. Climate, Shmimate. Blah, blah, blah.
Global warning? Don’t be a drama queen!
I prefer my planets red, white and blue!
Do me a favor and show us your more civilized side.
You have things all turned around!
What in the world are you talking about?
You can debate all you want about curvature and the masts of ships disappearing below the horizon.  But I know in my heart that you are flat.
Fake news, anyone can say there’re round.
Keep your geopolitical opinions to yourself!
I figured that in due course the whole world would speak against me.
And I told my wife, Melania, that it's mine, all mine.
Welcome nonbelievers to the Flat Earth World Debate!
So you say - but what about the eastern hemisphere?
Earth! You're all wet
And then the world turned on me ...
Please, no more global perspective.
Thank you for inviting me here today. Reminds me of that time some 65 million years ago...
A world without borders
Heeerrr’s Earth!!!
Not in my hemisphere!"
Now, to present the other side of the argument...
And now it is my honor and pleasure to introduce one who needs no introduction, Mother Earth!
I don’t KNOW why we can’t all just get along”..
Now, from our West Hemisphere correspondent...
Take the western hemisphere, for example...
And for a global opinion...
And so we kick off "Farewell Tour 2019!"
I say to my followers. Sometimes it seems the whole world is against us......
The last thing our planet needs is refugees from Earth.
A boastful earth will now put its own spin on things.
Notice the white areas?
They will soon be under water.
Atlas is under there somewhere ...
Despite what my opponent would have you believe, being worldly is not enough.
Behold! My base!
My opponent here promises the world; let me address you on a more human level.
Mother Earth is joining us today to discuss her plans for our future.
My opponent, the globe, will tell you that global warming is real, and largely caused by human behaviors.  The globe is all wet in its opinion"
...and my opponent changes his climate as often as the rest of us change underwear!
And now..let’s here it for someone who needs no introduction..here to tell us what’s happening everywhere..and we mean everywhere
Can’t get a world in edgewise
Climate change is a total hoax.  Let the world be my judge.
Now let's hear from the perspective of the Earth
When are we going to start talking about MY needs?
Not flat?  Have you seen yourself in a mirror?
I'm curiously attracted to you.
Fake News!! Don't listen to my hot-headed adversary.
My opponent is too round, too plump, and too worldly 
to be taken serious!
Can you prove you aren't flat?
Please wait your turn.
Uh, no. You’re flat.
We of the GOP, rebuke your histrionic claims of global warming!
You don"t intimidate me...I'm used to being the underdog!"
I'm here to remind you that this issue is real, and it's no small matter.
Don't you roll your sphere at me!
And while you may be warming to a new reality, I'm afraid you remain the very definition of a globalist.
You may have a world of ideas, but your argument is flat!
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. . . You’re no Jack Kennedy.”
There you go again, whining about your Doomsday Clock.
This is our new navigation app everyone!
I don't care about 'your'
 pronoun, you are dressed as "Mother Earth"!
It's broke and I'm the only one who can fix it. It'll be great, believe me.
When I win this election I'll be on top of my opponent.
My opponent is, in fact, flat!
Our guest lecturer, Professor Atlas, had to step out for a moment, but he’ll be right back to finish his talk on 
Back Pain in Ancient Greece.
Today our guest psychiatrist will deliver a lecture on the continental self
Now it is time to hear from everyone!
Stop rolling, please.
Atlas shrugged!  Is there an altruistic doctor in the house?
You can't change my mind! You're still flat to me!
The debate on global warming heats up"
America, please take a spin and let someone else speak.
I object to how much of the stage my opponent is using.
And to think, I was expecting you to come out flat.
I know a guy who says you're not really warm.
Earth,  I knew Uranus. Uranus was a friend of mine. Planet, you're no Uranus.
And I say, your 'personal experience' with global warming is fake news! MAGA!
The world will definitely have its say, just wait your turn.
Enough with the climate change – these dramatic temperature shifts you're experiencing are just global menopause.
And so I ask again: Do you really want a Flat-Earther as your candidate?
My fellow Americans, I assure you that my worthy opponent doesn't have a leg to stand on!
My opponent may THINK he's ready for the world stage.....
I thought the rules said no props?
It appears my opponent takes their stance on climate change rather seriously.
Well, uh......at least I'm not 96% salt water!!
Just because you mean the world to people...
And I repeat, even if the whole world should disagree with me, I know in my gut what is true and what is fake news.
And my opponent here...Lyin hot Mother Earth
It’s not about you.
I must dispute the assertions of my deluded opponent: it has been demonstrated time and again that only the Republican Party knows what’s best for the planet Earth.
You can think what you want to, but I'm acting locally.
You’re taking this personally.   I have data.
Fake news - the earth is actually flat!
Well if global warming is real, then why is it so cold in here?"
Who wants this genuine Earth rock for 25 moon rocks, do I hear 50?  50 going once, 50 going twice.  Sold! to the little man with the fashionable wave.
My opponent is an old, sick globalist who wasn't even born in America.
America is bigger and better than you!
I'll pause now to let the data speak for itself.
Stay in your orbit!
While I’ll cede to your roundness of shape, I’ve yet to see any evidence of your getting warmer.
You can’t hide forever Mr. President.
And finally, here is my irrefutable proof that the Earth is, indeed, flat.
Hope you had a chance to warm up before this!
Flat-earthers are not intimidated by your inflated ego!
The opposition candidate acts like a big shot, but can’t take the heat.
You, sir, are nothing but fake news.
Oh yeah? Well. look at these hands!
If only the planet could talk.
My opponent just THINKS it hot in here.
I'd like to introduce my oyster, The World.
Four and a half billion is still too young for perpetual hot flashes.
I don't care how big you are, we're in charge now.
I'd like to thank my host...
What do you mean "you're just another species"?
Claiming the debate was rigged, the Flat Earth proponent complained bitterly that his opponent should have been disqualified.
Unlike my opponent, I promise NOT to represent the interests of all.
And here to debate in favor of First World Problems...
Well, I'm not changing!
And now the fraction of the world that remains will tell you what  really happened to the rest of it.
Who are you to lecture me about global warming?
Welcome to Twitter Live! Round 1: the world vs. a man who read something online.
Is it just me, or is it globally warm in here?
Hey, Earth! Hovering behind people on a stage is my shtick, I made that up! Quit acting like everything revolves around you!
My opponent is flat wrong!
Speaking for the Eastern Hemisphere...
You're really going to build a wall ?
Are we really going to let this inarticulate blob rule our politics?
Hello, Folks. Tonight's first guest is a prop comic known the world over for his many humorous and absurd creations. Let's have a big hand for God!
Yeah, that’s just your opinion.
Whoa,  I was told one guy would be taking the climate change is real side!
From where I stand nobody can tell me it isn't flat.
Borders? What borders?
My opponent's world view is solipsistic!
Unlike my opponent, I will think globally but act locally.
Wait a minute - I’m the one whose supposed to warm up the crowd.
Are views are world's apart.
Don't blame me! I believe in climate change!
Let me stop you right there.. "Planet B" cannot possibly be a legitimate proposal.
I never thought that they meant this debate would be attended by the whole world.
As you can see, my opponent's global perspective remains 
uni-hemispheric.
...and I promise to focus on issues closer to home
I yield the remainder of my eons to the honorable planet.
Will you vote for your fellow man, or this filthy rock?
.... and now for another perspective ....
Ok, so you feel a little bit warmer...but how do we know it's caused by humans?
Socialism isn’t the solution, but you’re getting warmer.
Mediator: “The topic of debate will be global warming.”
You may claim you’re getting warmer, but it’s only fair that I’m allowed to present the other side.
And, as you can see, the Americas have an obesity problem.
The only conspiracy here is how you fit through the doorway
And I say, let’s give the whole world a platform with which to speak.
The world is flat.
It’s just me against the world now, baby!
And I too have personal experience with climate change
I find your arguments on global warming to be unsubstantiated and frankly rather circular.
As President,  I promise I will move heaven and you to get it done!
Today I'll be speaking for the world.
Ok, calm down. One at a time!
Now, that's no reason to heat up!
And I'm happy to call climate change out as a hoax no matter how much evidence there is for it
It's taken them 4.5 billion years to show us their climate change plan. I'm only asking for 1 term.
Now you tell me who's responsible for all of the earthquakes?
Keep going around in circles.
Let me reconsider my position on Climate Change.
Could we turn on the air conditioning? It's getting hot in here.
Atlas(t), an admitted globalist!
I look forward to the day when we are no longer opposing each other.
My Mother is always blowing things out of proportion.
And, I’d like to introduce my co-presenter, who is quite worldly.
Other than regularly occurring natural disasters, my opponent remains entirely silent on the issue of climate change.
Your position is one-sided.
Please sir, you've had your turn.
can i finish?!? thank you... what the world fails to recognize, is her responsibility in all of this.
I think the world of my opponent but clearly she is confusing her menopausal hot flashes with a global warming.
Now that you are off my shoulders, can you carry your own weight?
Dude, I have the numbers.
Our guest lecturer will be discussing the effects of globalization.
Our next speaker has the whole world in his hands.
A political candidate with this world view is uncommon.
For the last time, where are you hiding Ms. San Diego?
The oceans have so much to tell us. Pacific, what have you got to say?
Someone please quickly lower the microphone for Mr. Atlas. He is much shorter than we expected!
There, right there, thanks to God and Donald Trump, is the greatest nation on the planet!
If it is so hot in here then tell me why it snowed last week?
I'm sorry I said you were flat!
Earth is only here because it's been riding on the back of Atlas forever."
Point taken on the coming big climate change.
Size is relative.
My opponent is a Globalist, which means he is crazy. In addition, his version of the globe is not actual size.
We all have that weight on our shoulders!
"Studying the entire earth in one day can be...a little intimidating.
So we'll start this morning with the Western Hemisphere."
And that is why the earth is flat.
I’m leaving if California comes on inch closer.
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
And now, on this question of global warming, why don't we hear from Mother Earth, herself?
Equal time! I was promised equal time!
Read my lips: no blue planets.
This really shouldn’t be a debate
The turning point was the debates. Nixon looked sweaty, nervous and untrained. Kennedy, by contrast, was tanned and calm— but also colossal and globular, with great tidal seas and continents and ice caps and everything.
(These New Yorker cartoonist have it backwards, last week they had soup spinning and this week the world at a stand)
Fake News! Earth has a well-documented left-wing bias!
Now to tell us about the problems of the world  is the world !!
I, on the other hand, would like to take a more down to earth approach.
It's a fake world!
While my opponent here is going to try to argue climate change is 'real,' let me tell you about my tax plan.
I have crushing news!
Rumor has it that you're hoping for another meteor hit.
And yet my opponent has the audacity to question my membership in the Flat Earth Society!
Not the global warming argument again!
Yes, I've heard all your "science," but you're full of hot air.
Sorry!  Humans are in charge.  You have no say in the matter.
My opponent denies it, but given the current climate, change is our only option.
I don't even wear carbon shoes. Next question.
Hey, when do we get the non-global warming questions?
I was told my opponent would be flat
I told him not to carry the whole world on his shoulders.
My opponent is well rounded, but that argument fell flat
Goodbye
Speaking of inflation...
Yes, I'm trying to turn the heat down!
Prove it.
It doesn't matter what the world wants, it matters what we want
And, your Hot Flashes are distracting!
Such a nasty planet.
….and what makes you think, we 1% will listen you you?
I see no point to this global debate!
So I ask my opponent: why are you even here?
No, I still say that you are flat!
Next Up to our Podium..Someone who has be "Round" a long time and has a "world" of knowledge".
That is fake news! Global warming is a myth!
Now, my opponent may call himself a man of the world, but I have my doubts.
OK who is the wise ass who inflated my globe?
That's just, like, your opinion, rest of the entire world.
I know they said this was a global stage, but...
Never have I heard such a self-absorbed World View...!
I'll take "Scorch" for $500 Alex
You could have just told the speaker under you that you had a comment.
Flat-Earther Debate
WE CAN SAVE OUR HALF IF WE FORGET  ABOUT THE OTHER HALF
The Climate Change "Debate"
"Excuse me!We are not here to discuss personal problems."
Don't let the blue fool you. My candidate is in it for the green!
Who are you kidding?  Stop the debate!  Everyone knows the earth is flat, and that climate change isn’t real.
I do not believe, sir, that you are feeling any warmer”
She can say all she wants about rising temperatures and seas, but I made a snowball in April, so what does that tell you?
Are you sure it’s not one of your hot flashes?
In the eye of the beholder, you are a mere blimp in the universe.
Get outta my space!
Mr. Earth, in last night’s debate we heard a totally opposite opinion.
I disagree, the political climate takes precedence."
My opponent has a more globalist point of view.
Turn around and show the voters your backside.”
We originally invited Pluto,but since it’s status changed ,the little people protested”
You've had your say. Don't interrupt me when I'm on a roll.
When they said Mother Earth was going to speak today I definitely didn’t expect this.
Hold on, I asked for a WORLD view!
And here's what it looked like, only 15 years ago.
Your argument has fallen flat
“Yours is the Axis of Evil!”
Hold up”...I said global warming, not warning!
Your platform lacks a global perspective.
We could debate this all day long and all night long and all day long and all night long and...
I'll Make America Great Again, while my opponent is wrongly focusing on the Americas.
My therapist told me I was paranoid when I said you were always against me.
No global warming here folks! Move along...
That's YOUR opinion!
I think we should let Australia speak for herself!
Now my opponent, whose ego is the size of the entire planet....
May I ask our U.S colleague to explain his views of the world.
And without further adieu, he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders
In this political climate, there is no earthly reason for your position!
Introductions are unnecessary.  Her stage presence is global.
Motherhood aside, what else can you say for yourself?
And take note of how my opponent is trying to flood this debate with irrelevant arguments
Not now.
I am honored to be speaking on behalf of the entire planet.
And what have you ever done for us?
I told you it’s NOT HOT in here!!
I rest my case
My opponent is “warm”!  BOO HOO!
Where in the world did you get that information?
And as you can plainly see, the President's proposed new walls will keep out Mexicans! Chileans! Brazilians! Venezuelans! Cubans! Germans! Canadians! Alaskans! Hawaiians!
Now you're just talking out of your Tropic of Capricorn.
Presenting...for the first time on this stage... the World tour!
Ah, I can see right through this round-earther's ruse. You're an actor paid by NASA!
Make the Earth Great Again? Socialism!
And I say to you that a prolonged fever does not prove the reality of Global Warming.
Let me reiterate: "There is no such thing as global warming!!"
I respect your position, but you're taking climate change too personally
In this debate, the earth always wins
The man who has the whole world in his hands, seems to have disappeared.
You’re just slanted, tilted spin.
Atlas your ride is here...
Contrary to what you think, we do have at least one commonality. We’re both mostly made up of water. So there!
Can you name the planet where you would find these land masses?
Just turn and roll away, why don't you - make my day!
Storms, drought, flooding, famine. It's time for the voters to say 'goodbye cruel world."
Just WHO do you think you are?
Although we are in this crazy heated debate, I definitely agree with you!  If it weren't for YOU, none of us would be here.
What does a Mercator Globe know about accuracy?
Wow,wow, wow, I believe you've exceeded your time limit.
Is this thing on?
My opponent is a self-promoting blowhard concerned only with its own special interests.
Believe me, we hear you,
and we’re working on it!
You will observe the earth appears to be a round flat disk, but we have reason to believe otherwise.
I am sad to have to say this, but: From my observations throughout this debate, I truly believe that my opponent is polluted.
Whoa!  Slow your roll, big guy.
Consider my opponents history.  Can you really trust him?
The Earth is flat.
I guess I'm in the minority on this issue, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, one at a time!
How am I supposed to argue against the world?
You seem to think we could continue to exist without economic growth!
This is not what I meant by a continental presence.
My opponent's comments suggest he's from a different universe.
You may think you're getting warmer but my President is gonna make that part Great Again!
Voters today demand more than simple warmth!
If I had a nickel for every time someone tried to convince me that they speak for planet earth, I’d be a rich man.
And I repeat, I don’t see any evidence supporting my opponent’s claims of this so-called “climate change”!
Your opinion notwithstanding, all experts are not in agreement.
Who's we?
Yes, as his spokesperson, I can tell you, Donald Trump knows best how to fix you.
Now you’ve had your turn, it’s time to talk about REAL issues.
Okay, okay. you have a climate problem.
Didn't we settle this debate 2,000 years ago?
He's at a loss, not Atlas!
Re-Elect me, and I assure you, my opponent is a HUGE LOOSER!
And now a word from our Sponsor
And now, may I introduce the world, with few choice words to offer regarding global warming
And in conclusion, I have the world on my side.  Thank you.
Excuse me, but your two minutes are up
I don't care what the world says. I am right.
I won’t make the opposing candidate’s lack of worldliness an issue in this campaign.
That is where the Americas used to be before the President proclaimed climate change was FAKE NEWS!
I say to the world just because it is all of you against me, don't think I am wrong.
And what skeletons are hiding in my opponent's antipodes?
And my opponent insists the issue is global!
Yes, I know this is billed as a World Conference....
It's YOUR problem. I don't respect planets who let its inhabitants change the climate
I yield back the balance of my time and join with our last witness in urging the committee to run for their lives.
You're not the boss of me.
So, what time is it over there?
My research still proves you are flat.
“I think you’ll find our next speaker is really on the ball ....   
           just out of this world.”
Let the voters choose: Flat earth or America first.
Say hello to my little friend."
So let’s hear your side of the story Mr. Know It All...
I give you WORLD PEACE!
Can I have some ice water?
Please back up.Im feeling very warm.
OK God.  You win!
My esteemed colleague considers himself an Atlas 
among mere mortals.
And who do you think should pay for the wall?
I'll be the one who decides whether your climate is changing or not!
Will you stop ignoring me. Now listen to your Mother Earth!
‘Stay cool, stay cool?’ What on earth...YOU stay cool!
And what is your opinion on climate change?
And who, my friends, do you think is going to pay for these elitist policies that my opponent suggests?
The lone, skeptical scientist debates global warming.
We're debating pollution. You can't just cough.
What 'world view'?  You don't even have eyes
As a businessman I can tell you these climate change restrictions would cause havoc.   What is your stake in all this?
An now for the definitive word on global warming,I'd like to introduce.....
well.. someone here thinks a lot of themselves..
You think your global perspective is so big.
You’re not listening!!
Make the Americas Matter Again
In any discussion of geopolitical trends, it's essential to have an expansive world view.
My opponent has a heart of iron.
'Environmentalism,' he says? That's just the sort of corrupt, self-serving rhetoric that we need to eliminate from our politics!
Look, I know what I agreed to, but I just assumed you were speaking in metaphor
I'll ask you again for the final time- where were you when you last saw Atlantis?
Not all at once!
My opponent cannot hide his preference for big government.
Let's hear it for my esteemed colleague who's taking a break from carrying the world on his back.
Could you put your continent closer to the mic, I don't think the planets in the back can hear you.
Quick, get me that lever!
And it can be yours for the right bid!!
When I refer to the earth as small,I am speaking in relative terms.
I feel as if the presidential polls are tilting in your favor
Our next speaker is getting hot under the collar so it is his turn to be heard.
Don't give me that half-baked, self-serving argument about the worldwide effect of climate change.
Bring it on!
My esteemed colleague thinks it’s getting hot in here; probably just a case of greenhouse “gas”!
...and now we'll zoom in on Muskrat Ridge, Minnesota.
Climate, schlimate--my opponent can't even stand up straight!
With all due respect, my opponent is talking in circles to avoid the question.
My opponent is clearly unstable.
It doesn't matter if the whole world is against me!  I could stand in the middle of Times Square and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.
You see, you see, she is just blowing CO2 at you!
My opponent, the globalist.
That’s not where Lake Huron goes.
And my friend, Gaia, here, thinks she's too big to fail!
... it's not up for debate, the Earth is flat!
You claim you're too hot, but I see snow and glaciers, right there, in Alaska!
And now, in perfect harmony, the world will sing!
Unlike my opponent, I am emphatically NOT a globalist.
he said “flat earth” not “fat earth”
Okay folks, let's give it up for our next speaker--Mother Earth!
Hold on.  We’re turning up the AC
Your only campaign promise is to get Man to Mars?
That's not what your arctic face said last week on twitter!
Why aren't you on climate strike!
No, no, Mr. Asia, you are facing the wrong way.
I made you what you are today.
I don't care that you showed up in person looking like this.
I *still* think you're flat!
Your presence here will not persuade us about climate change!
Hal always lost the debate on climate change to his opponent.
I don't care what the other 99% say, who are you to tell me it's man made?
Don't believe what my opponent says he can fix; he has a world of problems of his own.
No worries. It's fake
Let's stop before this gets too heated.
Hmmfp......I will debate the Universe only!!
No need to scream. Your mic is on.
Yes, yes, we all know about you and your globalist philosophy!
Mother Nature has something to say.
And, if my worthy opponent were really in tune with what's going on, she'd realize the public is tired of hearing about climate change.
Okay, my opponent does have a clear perspective about global warming!
Fake news. If you were heating up, why would you be snowing up there?
But unlike my adversary, I am against a bigger global presence.
What on earth are you arguing about?
Listen world, we did not cause climate change.
Oh yeah?  Well who appointed you guardian of the world?
As the end is near, now a quick word from the Western Hemisphere.
If I may play Devil’s Advocate, some might say that you have failed to take responsibility for your own welfare and are, therefore, responsible for your own plight.
So who says my opinion isn’t as good as your 7.6 billion?
All my opponents contentions of  malaise are anecdotal, personal and very subjective.
Please welcome World Peace!
Well, folks, our next presentation about global warming will be given by Mother Earth .
And if your promises were Earth-shattering, we wouldn’t be here!
You say that, but if anything, you look cooler to me.  Flatter, too.
You can't handle the truth!
. . . And, speaking on the effects of global warming we have ...
The World on stage
So, Parents, we are now on Day 3 out of  7 of your children's Science Experiment
What do you know?
Even though you say you're hot, I still don't believe in global warming!
It was a well-rounded argument, but the rebuttal was out of this world.
See? She's full of hot air!
How can you sit there and deny global shrinking?
Today is the first day of the end of your life.
When you know how to pay for carbon cuts, then we'll talk!
You're a little too round for this flat earth debate sir
Our next speaker will tell us how it finally rid itself of parasites  through heat therapy.
This next item for bids ....!
My opponent's head must be in the clouds!
I think the world of my opponent, but he has really failed to grasp the vital concept of national boundaries.
Yes, we KNOW you have problems . . . But WE didn’t make them . . .
As the final act of his two terms in office, Trump issued an executive order annexing this area to Russia.
And the earth responded, "I'm not flat, I'm big boned."
And once again my opponent seeks to sway your votes with a transparent blend of intimidation and self-interest!
You can hear people from around the world telling me what a great job I’m doing!
That’s, like, your opinion, world.”
On planet Earth maybe, but your so-called “facts” do not conform to alternative reality.
In my concluding two minutes, I would like to just touch on North America
In the old days we always said the whole world was in front of you, now ...
These continents would not be empty if they had believed in climate change.
When considering the cosmos it's actually quite small.
Just because you are round does not mean the earth isn't flat.
I believe climate change is another example of my opponent flip-flopping on issues.
People vs. Climate Change
"And now, for the worldwide consensus..."
I reject your global elitism!
Mother Earth, what is your position on global warming?
You people can’t see what I can - it’s flat dammit
Stop trying to bowl me over with your take on global warming!
Wait! I'm signed up to speak on global warming not global inflation!
Until there’s bipartisan support we just  don’t have the votes, sorry.
Please, please please...Slow your roll.
My opponent is spreading fake news! Everyone knows that you are flat!
Wait, you can't just roll all over Bernie
With all due respect, I believe that there is no consensus to support your claim that climate change is caused by human activity.
.
  Our next speaker is Atlas, who is feeling a lot lighter these days since Trump alienated most of the weight of the world.
What proofs do you have that we are destroying you?
Unlike my opponent, Mr. Atlas, I will never let you down.
Talk about special interests.
Another continent heard from.
My opponent is making a circular argument
Hold it right there! The science is still out on your round-Earth theory!
The speaker to my left would like to talk about it's favorite topic, climate change?
Further more, my opponent's climate change policies are based on outrageous conspiracy theories.
Hot enough for ya?
Don't be fooled by my opponent's earthy appearance. She's responsible for global warming!
No pressure, your only speaking on behalf of the whole world.
What's your opinion about living on Mars?
Please, stop spinning. This isn’t helping my macropsia
No, YOU'RE mistaken!
I yield to my opponent.
My opponent purports to represent a world view; but I say it is a small world.
My opponent cannot be trusted on global climate change, as a globe, her view of climate change is clouded by her pro-globe bias
Our guest speaker tonight, standing before his latest creation, will address "The Challenges of Creation."
Globalization, Schmobilization
My opponent chooses to hide behind global warming, but what evidence do you have?
...and yes, you may say my views are out of the mainstream, but let me remind you that world opinion is only that: opinion!!!
My opponent is clearly a single-issue candidate.
and here on my left is the manifestation of donalds trumps ego.
Your comments betray your Western bias!
And speaking for the pro side of the Global Warming debate....
As everyone can see, my opponent is all wet!
I don’t care how hot you are. Nobody but me touches the thermostat.
Actually, this is more of a comment than a question.
I predicted that widening the canal would allow South America to drift eastward, and I was right.
OK. Don't get so puffed up about it.
My opponent this evening is a noted "Flat Earther"!
My opponent is trying to get you to warm up to him.
Blah blah blah....I happen to know that the other side disagrees completely.
Unable to bear the burden of the world's problems, my opponent quit the race. I won't
This is your last global warning, only one person can speak at a time.
Apropos of nothing, notice how the upper Northwest region of North America resembles a goblin.
Your points are flat!
Let me just stop you right there, Earth.
You make a valid point, sir, but in all fairness, you looked really flat!
Mother Earth, what are your comments on climate change?
The American people reject one-worldism.
And here we have the Americas
Your world view sucks!
Don't be so roundabout
Yes we know it’s our fault you’er warming up but you didn’t need to crush Antarctica just to prove your point !
At this scale, you can actually see how much of Miami is already below sea level.
This presentation will be short - the speaker hasn't got long to live
Will the gentlewoman yield?
I always knew you were round...
All together now!  He's got the whole world in his hands, he's got the whole world in his hands......
Ok, now my compatriot will give you the World View.
My opponent is so very naive in believing that each of us can really make a difference in this world “
And I say it's fake news.
And now that I've completed the demonstration of my shrink-ray...wait where is everybody?
As the poet Wordsworth said so many years ago, "The world is too much with us."
If my opponent claims to be getting warmer, let's take his temperature right now!
Mankind is a virus and natural disasters are the cure!
My friends, we finally have proof! The world is flat, there is no global warming in a  flat world, and the border walls are only from a Hollywood set."
What in the world?
You lier, we all know you’re flat!!!
It is my contention, that the world is flat.
World, what ever you do--don't sneeze.
Don't believe those who say the world is getting smaller!
...and, as absolute proof, this two-dimensional opponent proves my flat earth contention.
My opponent's so-called curvature would only serve to weaken our position on the international playing field.
Rising oceans?  That's Fake News, Mother Earth!  Time you realized the only thing worth hearing about is rising profits!!
It's hiding something. Where's its long-form birth certificate?
These lands used to be called 'continents' before the water covered them.
Pay no attention to him. That's just how he rolls.
Don't you shrug your shoulders at me!
I'm just here for the air conditioning!
My opponent is really turning up the heat.
Earth, are you trying to tell us something?
Pit me against the world, I’ll win!
Now class this is the Western Hemipshere
That’s only one hemisphere!
According to our consultants your evidence for global warning is inconclusive.
I think the world of my opponent, but he can be overbearing.
It's rigged.
Do I hear 230 trillion?
I reject the earth's statement on global warming!
“It’s not global warming; they are only hot flashes."
It appears Professor Higgins will be receiving his award posthumously.
Shut up, your killing me.....
Excuse me, could I get a glass of ice water before the debate begins? 
It’s getting a bit toasty in here.
Don’t you dare use that condescending tone with me!
Such a nasty woman!
Please, one at a time.
. "The world would like to says a few truths about global warming "
At least the rest of the solar system agrees with me.
Oh no, Mother Earth! You too?
Now that you're here, please settle the debate: Did Tony Soprano die in the finale?
Who are you going to believe, me or the world's biggest globe?
Remember, this is not a debate it’s an intervention.
You think you're hot! I say you're not!
Every time I try to debate this happens.
'"It has come to my attention some of you believe we are mired in a global crisis!"
My opponent is obviously biased in favor of climate warming. I’d like to remind the audience that he has provided no direct evidence of ice-melt.
Our next speaker is Atlas. He should be lifting up shortly.
We love climate change, don't we folks?  My opponent, she resists, but she's looking hotter every day!  Should we give her a round of applause? Let's clap for her folks...
Can somebody open a window? its kinda hot in here
It's just a big balloon filled with hot air!
Today's debate: Climate Change--fact or fiction.
Put your hand down, sonny! I've got something to say about what's really going on!
I've already told you...GLOBAL WARMING IS FAKE NEWS
Too weighty an argument.
Fact! It is not getting warmer in here. Ask any scient-ish.
I will conclusively prove you don't have a leg to stand on. Could somebody turn on the air?
More Fake News!
I'm not 'two-faced' you moron, I'm just rotating along my axial tilt!
Now please explain your comments about being “pro natural selection.”
The good news is the Panama Canal will eventually be obsolete.”
I'll keep this short since time is running out; "I'm dying".
How could you be warm?  The air conditioner is set at 72F.
...therefore, I conclude global warming is fake news.
Just because you're 4.5 billion years old, doesn't mean you know any thing about climate change!
I'm sick and tired of feeling like an outsider!
Global opinion seems to be against my opponent.
Give me a place to speak and I will conquer the world.
I'm sorry, but the fire department will not allow anything this hot in the auditorium.
Sure, you beat me in experience, Mother Earth, but I'm a man.
Stop the world, I wanna get off.
Hold on, you'll get your chance to talk.
I still don't believe in global warming.
Don't let this hologram fool you, the Earth is flat!
Your ideas fall flat.
Oh contraire, we are rapidly changing course, for example, I’m now seeing paper straws everywhere.
Well, I think you suck too!
Not that it really matters, but that little dot just off the coast of Florida is Treasure Cay, Bahamas and that's where I'm taking my Family for a vacation in April
Our next speaker is among the most recognized speaker on the world stage!
If the world is in so much danger, then why doesn't it say so?
Your point is well taken, Atlas.
My worthy opponent has decided that we need to play, 'Where is Waldo?'
Please leave the room - FAKE NEWS!
I see some very cloudy thinking.
Warming, he claims? Hardly!  I served at 98.6. I know 98.6. 98.6 is a vital sign of mine. My opponent is nowhere near 98.6.
As the WWW turns 30, I'd like to apologize on its behalf for Twitter.
I will admit that my opponent has made effective use of social media.
Ah, with a wave of my hand and 20 more years of a fossil fuel based society I can make this all disappear!
It’s not your turn yet, Mr.Global Warming, we need to discuss some wall issue first!
Wait a minute! I have to talk about why there is no such thing as climate change.
The world is too much with us!
Sorry, It's all about Me!
Me thinks the world is too much with us.
Now now, let's not get heated buddy.
This argument is getting way too heated.
Oh, please. It's just these hot stage lights...
My constituents say otherwise!
Atlas Smushed!
I can only speak for myself!
Can we discuss world peace?
You keep saying that, but you don’t look any warmer to me?”
Stop right there! Like you are an expert in worldly things.
Donald,Donald put it down!
So moved.
So you think you have the weight of the world to worry about, let me explain something to you.
My opponent is hiding behind Antarctica!
I'd like to introduce the Earth, who has had enough bull caca about climate not being a very serious thing.
My opponent continues to attack my record protecting endangered sea turtles. To that I have one response: Dinosaurs.
They say actions speak louder than words but apparently that's not the case. The Earth has something to say.
I don't care what you think. I'm American, therefore I come first.
That's really not your best angle!
You're out of orbit on this one.
. . . and after that rollicking critique,we thought we'd let her speak for herself.
What are your thoughts on climate change?
I will not be intimidated by my opponent's outmoded reliance on 
size.
Stop right there!  I am the president and I have declared that we are NOT warming you up !
Now let’s hear from the Defense.
Yes, I know my opponent is worldly.
But the record shows that you are NOT interested in world peace!
I feel at a disadvantage debating the global economy.
Ok, ok, I’ll refer to you as “earth”, not “the planet”.
He's got the whole world in his hand.
Our first speaker is a world-class traveler.
As I've told your president many times, the whole thing is America.
It will take 12 hrs for us to hear the voice of the other side of the world. We can't wait that long.
And you call yourself an oblate ellipsoid.
You just think you're hot stuff.
All right then, I'll concede the Americas...
Let's skip the debate and make this my concession speech.
Now, I think our audience would really like to hear you dish about your relationship with Pangaea. What really broke you up?
I say - You should go back where you came from!
I'm sorry...but I am speaking about universal principles...
Some people would say I’m the biggest. They would say I’m bigger and better than the entire world.
Ha! You've been shrugged off.
You’re like my Ma. You complain about the heat and too cheap to turn on the A/C.  So you blame me, always me.
You and me against the world,"..
My opponent needs to accept that our momentum is irreversible and her time is done.
You might contain multitudes, but I've got the NRA and the Koch Brothers I my corner!
Ma'am, please keep it cool. This doesn't need to be a heated conversation.
My opponent will get nothing done if elected because he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders."
How can it have got too warm in here if I'm still wearing my tie?
Hold on, we need to get you a bigger microphone.
Here to present the American perspective is.....America
Stop asking ME questions. Let’s ask the WORLD.
Just because you’re bigger than me doesn’t mean you’re right.
See, it's really not a small world after all.
Before we begin, could you state your name and why you're running for president?
Unlike my opponent, I take global warming very seriously....
Fred 
 Fred! Come back! I told you not to get to close to the water
Nothing to worry about.  It's really flat.
But it appears my opponent here still believes all that nonsense about Climate Change.
This is the new plan with no borders to worry about.
Will our next mystery guest enter and sign in, please
It’s your fault for having an environment to ruin!
Despite all the evidence I maintain my opponents arguments still fall flat
My opponent claims to have the weight of the world on his shoulders, but I assure you it's a hoax.
And let us see your positive side
You don’t speak for me!
I would like to introduce our featured speaker who will  talk on the subject of earth’s climate change.
...In conclusion, while my opponent flatly denies it, all her arguments are nothing but hot air.
I agree that the major problem of our time is global shrinking.
We need to eliminate this global threat. - David Ostrov
Whoa! One thing at a time.
My opponents is a true globalist
And HE claims he wants to make the world a better place, but can you see that happening?!
Don't be fooled.  My opponent will tell you fake stories about global warming.
Shape-shifting doesn't make you a climate change expert.  You need charts and photos.
The whole world revolves on it
Brag all you want. We all know you are getting smaller.
As usual earth refuses to go on the record"
You just stop right there!
If you can’t take the climate change get out of the kitchen
Sir, although you may be a celestial orb, I submit that you lack standing!
And in conclusion, let me just say, "you don't look warm to me".
My opponent as you can ladies and gentlemen is clearly an internationalist.
We've already seen Pangea, you don't need to do the trick again
I told you time and again! Not yet, ya big bully.
This worldly candidate is throwing his polar ice cap into the ring.
You? Round? A Socialist Hoax!
My opponent seems to thing getting all hot and bothered is going to sway the voters!  Not on my watch!
Why should Florida be the center of the world?
My opponent wants to solve all the world's problems; but I have proven I can eat a deep-fried corn dog on a stick.
Hold on there, Buddy, you think you're the whole world?
So what are your thoughts on global warming?
Now, I'm sure I'm going to be called a bigot for calling you a "globalist"
now whats your opinion on global warming
W O A H , stop  STOP ! .. Madame Speaker , are you OK ?
When on earth do I get to talk?
This is what it will look like with no Starbuck’s
Not all at once, please.
And now the planet has a few things to say on the subject of mercy.
Just look at my opponent's miserable record.  Nothing is certain except death and taxes.
Introducing global warning.
We're abandoning all of this, in favor of an intelligent planet.
You may be worldly wise, but ...
It’s hard to win a debate when everyone else is against you.
After learning that a skilled debater must argue both sides, Earth proves itself flat.
No, that’s not Israel
Hey, hold up there, I think you're getting a little too hot...
I'm four times the size of Baja California, so don't give me your crap that i'm just a small human."
Let's not be irrational—OK, sweetheart? You're just having a hot flash.
I present to you the United United States of America!
I know you're out there somewhere, you bum.
Regardless of how much evidence she's presented, I'll just never believe that climate change is real.
Welcome to the Flat Earth Society. I am sorry to say that our next speaker was sucked up by an unknown gravitational force.
The big picture from here, you can't see change.
We all heard what the World is saying but let me put it this way?
Your personal problems are not our's
Wait, before you start, don't say anything that will get us heated up.
Atlas, up from out of in under there!
This debate is out of this world!
I'll give you the last word.
Counterargument from Unexpected Speaker at Davos
The gravity of it’s performance is captivatingd
How big was yo mama?!
And our next speaker speaks to us from down-under
While I am poised and composed, note my opponent’s nervousness exhibited by sweating and spinning!
The next speaker will address the possibility of life on the other side.
Cool it, hot head!
Stop acting like my mother!
It was then that he remembered both his fear of public speaking AND his xenophobia.
Thank you for that uplifting speech, Atlas!
You all know her as the late, the great, the soon-to-be-retired ...
I wish to welcome you to the first Democratic Presidential debate.  Uncertain that our venue would accommodate the current
candidates plus those undecided, we have opted for an alternative  format...
The point is, it's just you and me against the world!
And what proof do you have that climate change is real?
I believe the opposition has a distinct advantage.
Still flat?
Hi Mom, I finally made it to the world stage.
I still debate it's flat.
No, we don't celebrate Earth Day anymore.
So you agree that humans should not be vaccinated.
We'll just let it speak for itself.
With all due respect, methinks the lady doth protest too much.
Changing! not warming.  And, nobody likes a smartass, sir.
I don’t care about your so-called evidence.  I’m a very smart person, and I say global warning is a Chinese scam
Lock Earth Up!
Ladies and gentlemen - your oyster
As you can see, the problems is at the NORTHERN border
Globally,we want to hear what you think!
What in the World are you saying? 
Everyone knows you're round, not flat"
My speaking prop is brought to you by Costco
I am not getting hot under the collar.
My opponent is obviously overly- awed by my power point
What in the world makes you an expert on if global warming exists or not?
Need I state the obvious?  3/4 of the World’s population has a different view.
Speak, world. What can we do to save you?
You have been nothing but a drama queen.
Yes, that was pitch perfect but it's not that kind of flat we're debating.
I represent something bigger than you!
It all started out as nothing
I STILL say you're wrong!
Stop! You don't have standing! We've already heard what you have to say, and no one believes you
Fake, fake, fake news!
God has asked the earth to speak in her stead.
THERE IS  NO  SUCH  THING  AS  GLOBAL WARMING!
Let's reflect on my opponent's claim to the consensus view...
Has the globe warmed up enough to respond?
As anyone can plainly see the truth rolls right off of you.
Make America not so great this time!
It's just a fever, not the apocalypse.
The skeletons in my opponent's record, you just wouldn't believe!
The earth, like a coin, has two sides.
I'll get to global warming in a minute.
Nevertheless, she persists!

Margaret Olnek, Superior, Colorado
And now, supporting this evening's resolution, "Climate Change is Real", a last minute added  speaker . . .
Ok, ok, I'm attracted to you - everyone is. But what's that go to do with this argument?
Don't think you can just roll over me here...!
And let's not forget all those offshore deposits.
I know you think you’re the world’s greatest debater, but I disagree.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  This miracle occurred on Day Two, and absolutely nothing my opponent says will convince me otherwise.
I'll let you speak in a moment. Though you probably won't have a point.
You try convincing the world!
And I am going to call it "Trump World".
And now our keynote speaker, Mother Earth, will share with us her perspective on global warming.
Have you spun off your axis completely with that crazy global warming theory?
OK, Global Warming! You don't have to be so inflated about it!
Her ego is out of control.
Whoa - slow your roll.
South America couldn't move to Canada so it is moving to Africa.
This is america.
I staunchly defend pineapple on pizza.
Can't you think about anyone else except yourself?
you had your time to speak!
I matter as much as you!
What's that, Mother, you say all the other countries are behind you?
If I could finish…
Look, don't get me wrong, you've done good by us so far; we just need to give those business and agriculture lobbyists the voice they deserve.
I stand by my flat Earth comments. You call those Grand Tetons?
Furthermore, we are much more important than you - we can think.
Your voice may be big, but your audience is small.
And now, without further ado, you all know her.....(thunderous applause drowning out name)
And I suppose that is meant to be your version of the Great Lakes?
Folks, don't be fooled! This is just a tired rehashing of the EarthFirst! movement, and it didn't work the first time!
Coming soon to a theatre near you: "Honey, I Shrunk the Climate Change Deniers!"
Speak up, I can't hear you.
As you can see, I'm more concerned about Global Shrinking !
And on your right, discussing global warming, is The World!
No Collusion!
I am uncategorically opposed to globalism!
OK. So much for YOUR  position on the issues.  What about the EASTERN hemisphere?
As can be seen here, the Affirmative side of the Flat Earth debate is struggling in his rebuttal.
Let's talk climate change
As anyone can see, my opponent cannot speak for the other 5 billion people on earth.
...and furthermore, my opponent doesn’t even speak English!
Back up, you are burning me up!
Stop complaining!
You're full of hot air!
I still say the earth is flat
And everyone on this side of the globe is technically "American."
You’re no Jack Kennedy
Polls are meaningless!
One at a time please.
And now we will hear from the representative from Fiji.
It looks like we’re in a world of trouble.
I can tell that you are hot and bothered with me!
I will never believe that you are round nor warming.
Here's to our next world-class candidate for 2020.
You stand there and tell how climate change has affected you!
Your argument goes round in circles. Like your shape!
You don't have to be silent - It's not Spring.
It's a small world yet there is an ocean between me and my opponent.
Even if I am the only one, I will speak my truth!
My opponent would hope to distract you with her earthy comments.
OK, we get it!
I knew you would drag climate change victimhood into the debate!
As the previous speaker was saying, it's clear that global roaming is the greatest existential threat we face today.
I'm more important than you are. And I have the rigorous poll data to prove it!
And now let's hear the other side of this heating debate.
Our next guest didn't believe in "extra terrestrial life" until we came along.
Don’t touch! - it’s still hot from global warming
Now, Grandma Earth will talk about “human harassment”.
This World Debate is NOT fair and balanced!!!
As moderator I would help if you could keep your comments to 25 words or less. You have a lot of people with you
My opponent continues to shrug his responsibilities.
...and that is why you are wrong about global warming!
Just shrug it off.
The condition of our planet is debatable?
We refuse to be intimidated by your climate extortion rhetoric!
How would you know about global warming anyway?
You may not be flat, but certainly flat wrong.
Those polar ice caps were not worth anything
 anyway
Well... it’s obvious this is just a round earth shill
And now, speaking on behalf of the Earth ...
Sorry folks Jimmy got a little carried away with the paper mache model.
It seems that  that Atlas shrugged our debate
‘Someone tell me how this is possible.’
Give me one proof that you're not flat.
My opponent WACKY Western Hemisphere and his friends in the FAKE NEWS media have ruined our country. SAD!
I must have ten billion dollars to build MY spherical wall.
My opponent may think global, but I'm not buying the local act.
First to the rostrum will be South Pacific. Then we'll hear from the other side at the anti-podium.
And now let's hear from Mr. Atlas...Mr. Atlas is speaking for the motion
Using this life-sized model of the earth,I shall now explain to you why climate change is no big deal.
Although we can certainly appreciate your fire and fury, we simply aren’t willing to negotiate a peace agreement at this time.
The fact is, let's say it, is Mr Atlas is too old
































Hold him up! Hold him up!
Clearly, my opponent has no grasp of detail.
While I completely agree that climate change is an urgent matter, we first need to decide which automotive industries will receive the biggest tax breaks.
And now we hear from our heavyweight speaker on the topic of global warming
That’s how I roll.
Planet Earth, we welcome you to Jupiter
And don’t get me started on the problems happening in your district.
My opponent is looking a little feverish.
My opponent’s carbon-tax proposal is ludicrous.
So you don't care about global warming? Well, how does global rolling grab you?
I may be in the minority here, but...
Furthermore, regardless of your symptoms, I still say global warming is all in your imagination.
Hell hath no Fury like Climate Change scorned!
If you don't believe it's flat, I'm going to turn this  over and you will see for yourself!
I agree with my opponent's world view
All your comments are one-sided!
Recent Connection between North and South America Reaffirmed
And if it's global warming, why is it so cold in here?"
...but voters chose me!
To answer your question, no, I never smoked pot in college
You don't scare me - there is no such thing as global warming.
Despite his spotty voting record, my opponent would like you to believe he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.
My opponent is blind to the beauties of the free market and capitalism, and is, indeed....A SOCIALIST!
Your hot flashes are not germane to this campaign.
Liar!  That's not what I mean by "Make America Great Again"
I know a side effect of global warning is hot air but please wait your turn
STOP!!!We have addressed global warming.
Ms.Earth,do you believe in Climate Change.
Stop!  In the name of love!
Your stale arguments are hardly you-shattering.
He's just a bunch of hot air
As far as planets go, you've got the experience.  But can you wiggle your fingers?
I stand by my statement that Mercacator is, and always will be, the gold standard of projections!
and now, lets hear the silent majority!
My opponent has flip-flopped on the environment.
Earth, you're looking extra hot today
And for our Global Warming segment, let me introduce our next speaker, North America.
You might think this is a big soap bubble, and it is.
Please tell us what proof you have of climate change!
If you’re warming at such an alarming rate how do you explain your presence on this stage?
Yes, I love my country. I’m a proud nationalist. Unlike my opponent, Lil’ Globey! Isn’t that right, Globey?
And now a word from the Earth about Globalization, as it relates to global warming, and our feckless leaders who are waiting for the whole Shithouse to burn down."
That was before the Suez Canal
We're citizens of the United States, not the world.
So, what’s the big deal?  We all know the Earth has climate...
Furthermore, my worldview is superior to that of my opponent.
Stop right there! I get the message.
My opponent has no earthly idea!
Klaatu Burada Nikto
I presume you are aware the president’s Science Advisor states the research is not clear on whether global warming actually exists . . .
Yes, well, we’ve heard all about your perspective, but what about the blinkered, local view?
Does this outfit make me look fat?
Welcome, just to set the record straight,round or flat??
Got the message but you're going to have to simplify.
What in the World do you mean by that!?
The debate is over.
Time to chill!
Archimedes? We will give you another fulcrum.
Next debater: global warming; fact or fake news?
Although mah opponent's accomplishments are indisputable, his arrogance is without precedent.
Globalisation is round the corner.
My worthy opponent has disappeared into the South Pacific.
And now, Atlas!
Don't preach to me about CO2 emissions, not 
when you flew here on on your own private jet!
I don't want to be the lone desenter, but...
You don't look so warm to me!
I’m surprised you got through the door Larry, looks like you packed on a few extra...pounds.
To the best of my knowledge, this globe is actual size.
That's all folks!
You haven't been new since 1492!
World Climate Conference

"Can you scooch? You're blocking my PowerPoint."
Hemispheres of the world, unite!
NO! I'm tired of debating climate change with you!
Fuck you
What you’ve always been lacking is proper representation
I yield the balance of my lifetime to the gentleman from Pangea.
Can I get my oponent’s mic raised a little? I feel like I’m talking to the Earth’s vagina.
I can't handle the truth! My existence is grotesque and incomprehensible.
You're missing the point!"
The Earth would like to end the climate crisis conference with a closing statement. Can I get a Mike?
Earth as seen by the Republican National Committee!
He found the other candidate's world view to be a bit polemic
Go ahead, the deniers dare you to make your case.
Well actually Mother Nature, the climate doesn't really work like that"
The flat Earth debate continues...
And now for the cosmology report.
I have invited my dear friend Mother Earth here to tell you all how great she really feels.
My opponent makes up in size what it lacks in brains.
Its the western version of the Euro, Trumps face is on the back.
And my opponent would have you believe the world is round.  Just more FAKE NEWS.
I think you have a pimple on your backside. Oh wait, that's just New Zealand. Never mind.
Populism will always trump globalism!
Hang on, up there! Mr. Atlas is still in traffic.
Can someone move this thing... it's getting warm in here.
You feel cool from here!!
Hold on there big fellah. I paid for this microphone.
You have no standing in this court!
I firmly disagree with my worldly opponent.
My opponents self-serving proposals are not sustainable.
I beg to differ with that perspective!
Sorry, but there's not point in debating the issue of global warming. The President has spoken.
Your argument about being a big shot doesn't hold water -- look around you -- there 's the Pacific and Atlantic oceans!
My opponent has morphed into a globalist.
By way of introduction, I'd say that our next speaker has truly seen it all.  And, oh the secrets she can tell!
There you go again, with your American-centric arguments!
I’m here in spite of the revolution.
okay, okay your getting a little heated tom.
I know you have big problems but so do I!
Find Newfoundland!  Free Newfoundland!
Global warning.
Now I know how Indiana Jones felt!
Quit the dramatics and stop whining!
We can’t shrug this off!
I flatly disagree with how you've rounded your climate figures.
Don't be so upset. You know that I think the world of you"
Please, let me finish.
The climate change debate just got serious.
My opponent has lost focus on our district's concerns.
Don’t let my opponent’s flat earth denial fool you.
Ms. Earth is not fit to hold office.
Do not argue with a Homo sapien!
But  then WE created plastic.
So what else you got?!
wait if youre here,,,, then I'm... oh no! not again!
“My opponent here is a one-worlder!”
I grant you,your rhetoric is earthy,but frankly,it's hard not to conclude you're all wet when it comes to the facts of the matter.
World, you now have thirty seconds to counter the President's statement.
Don't listen to her - she's full of hot air!
I"m here to tell you about climate change first hand.
Isn't it obvious, the Earth is flat.
I will not be bullied, Mother Earth!
How about you let me answer this one?
Actually, you're flat.
And as host of “The Blue Planet” you claim climate change to be fact?
My ex-wife is near the upper right, sort of
Alas, let’s let the globe have a word about it’s own issues.
And I say... you're not global enough!
We are the one hundred percent.
Our next speaker is the renowned world ...
Your right, but, my wife drives a Prius!
You just think you're putting your best face forward.
I know I speak for everyone here when I say we're all very tired of your speaking so elliptically.
Usually somebody warms up the crowd for me, not the other way around
We like to think of it as an open floor plan.
You, madam have been around too long to appreciate modern ideas.
I feel the earth moving over my feet.
Quit repeating that fake news.  No, it's not hot in here.
I’m telling you, climate change is not real!
Let me finish Mother Earth!
All your answers are flat.
How about another billion so we can keep using fossil fuels?
Why so negative? It's like night and day when you let your darker side out.
You need a route canal.
I was told this was going to be a Town Hall meeting.
My opponent has an inflated view of himself if he pretends he's a globalist at heart!
It seems that my opponent, Atlas, is too scared to show up to this debate.
Is that your only talking point, Global Warming?
The earth is flat. Don’t get so overheated.
My opponent, the incumbent, has stated that he feels the weight of the world in his shoulders. I say it is time for a change.
You may have won this debate, but I'm patient enough to know that I will be the winner in just 12 years.
While my esteemed colleague will attempt to convince you otherwise, I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the earth is flat.
Atlas, speak into the microphone.
Poppycock. It's nothing but a heated discussion.
You're only appealing to your base!
Who can point out to us where we are today?
Now, right there is the area we’ll be discussing today.
my opponent, or "Fat Orb" as some have called her...
Current astromological views are truly wide-ranging,  however today I share Dr. H. Penny's well-known Buddhistic belief about the sky's impermanence.
„See? If there was a problem she would speak now!“
Stop lying to the populace! You're the exact same temperature you've always been.
Now stop rotating and listen! I find it hard to believe that you still do NOT believe in global warming.
Please state your opinions on how we’re doing.
Better watch your back!
What evidence do you have there's global warming ?
Our rebuttal to your argument is to look at the evidence.
What evidence do you have to keep denying the Arctic is going bald?
She’s turning her stance yet again!
My young Democratic opponent professes to be a geography professor,really?
My opponent here is full of hot air.
Yo Earth, I’m really happy for you, I’ll let you finish, but Mars has some of the best videos of all time!
So, let me introduce to you the most worldly individual I have ever met!
We are in the midst of a global warning!
My opponent is reportedly in hiding somewhere up there in the Hudson Bay area.
Now now, don't blow your cool!
Since the other speaker didn't show, let's have a contest. Now, everyone write one cartoon caption about this massive ball on stage and I'll collect them, read them aloud,  and we'll somehow declare a winner. Tie breaker: Where is Columbus, IN?
You're nothing but a Chinese hoax!
Let's give a very warm welcome to our own Blue Marble.
To introduce our next speaker, Atlas... oh, darn!
Today’s Keynote: Expanding Your Horizons
You're getting warmer? Not getting warmer! Fake news!
Your thoughts on Flat Earth theory.
You seem a bit heated, take a chill pill.
I can assure you that pollution will subside in 15 years. By then we will be dumping our garbage on Mars.
The whole world’s against me!”
- Griff Urang-Schuberth
Portland O
You are only a  part of what I'll own if  i'm elected!
I challenge my opponent to release their measurements to the public so we all may know whether they are flat or round.
I don't give a shit if you're on a roll!
I would remind you, good sir, that my name is Archimedes.
How dare you, sir? My mother was a planet!
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times: Covfefe!
Ahem
You say that now but as soon as you turn your back I’m sure we’ll hear another story!
Fellow members, that is why we have adopted the song, "You and Me Against the World" as our theme
You will not replace me!
The world sure loves to argue.
So you're saying you are not flat you are at least 36d?
Is this thing “On”?
I can’t hear you !
As you can see, the organisers could not find a single person to stand against me
You're ALL against me!
You want to talk about conflicts of interest?  Let’s talk about your Green New Deal, shall we?
Feels pretty cool to me.
Stop World, I wanna get off!
Not fair! I too would like a warm-up.
Oh, sorry! I’m mean climate change not global warming.
Another year's wear on your ozone layer and you're toast!
Now, this may be an unpopular opinion...
It was six days, God rested on the seventh.
I think your take on a global economy is slightly exaggerated
And now...proof that the world is flat.
Once again, I challenge my opponent to disavow that he aspires to higher office.
While my opponent supports unrealistic policies like the Green New Deal.
But what have you done for us lately?!
And now, before she becomes extinct, we'll hear from our all plastic Mother Earth
No need to say it; I can already feel you warming.
Looks like my opponent has shrugged his duties.
My opponent thinks climate change isn't a hoax...but I know better!
... we're going to Canada and the USA, Mexico and Honduras... and Haiti and Aruba! We're going to Panama and Colombia and Brazil! And we're going to Argentina and Chile and Peru and Bolivia! and We're going to New York to take back the UN! YEAAAAH!
Now you're flat!
It is my pleasure to introduce the Earth to speak on the issue of man made climate change.
Let's here from everyone, but please keep it under 24 hours.
I challenge you to a debate on climate change.
Is it my turn to speak yet?
My opponent would have you believe that what you see is what you get. I think not.
Atlas, the world takes a stand!
If this is just about the tweeting,I can stop.
I have no earthly idea where he is.
I'm going to build a wall along your Mexican border!
Whoa! This five minutes per person rule isn’t working.
It’s not global warming, you just have a fever.
These days, it seems like the whole world has to have their say.
My base believes me not you!
let me finish!
And now, let me welcome to our stage all of America
Admit it -- you have nationalist tendencies!
Well, I was banking on winning by default, so I didn't prepare any remarks. I am thoroughly stunned that my opponent made it through the door.
'Colleagues, I want to talk to you today about the New World Order.'
Wait, I’m getting off  now.
Please, let me speak. You’ve held sway for far too long.
Is there something wrong with the Mic? You sound like you're under water.
And let's see what's behind curtain number 2!
All together now:
‘During the debate he coukdnt’t get a world in edgewise’
I've upped my carbon usage, World.  Up yours!
If you don't disgorge the hydrocarbons at cost, my species will peel you like a grape.
And now a word from the shrinking earth society.
Really?
Moderator . . . moderator:  He is allowed to inflate himself like that?  Was that in the rules?  I didn't see that in the rules!
As you can see, my opponent doesn't stand a chance!
Most voters may think the world of you, but in this country....
A victim of global warming
As a small boy growing up in Liechenstein..........
I sense you are drifting away from this debate.
That's a preposterous opening statement but what should we expect from a flat-earther?
You seem to be hiding the rest of the world behind your back!
He's old, but he still as wits about him.
Tomorrow, The World !
So do you want to vote for me or Global Domination?"
Global warming, as you can see, is not caused by humans. It is that pregnant duck at the top of screen that is sucking up all of our air.
This is the End of the World as we know it!
Everybody knows you're flat. Fake News!
Get me the whoever is responsible for this. It's a small world.   I said it is a SMALL world.
Your mamma's so flat....
'It's a compelling argument but I still you're flat!'
The earth is flat.  Don't believe my opponents crazy idea otherwise.
I would like to ask  my  opponent  in this  debate  'Why  she  did not  speak  up  before !"
First, a shout-out to the Greelcruffs of Kalaxon 5 for hosting this event...
Climate change is fake news!
And this balloon represents his inflated view of America....
Simply put the world is a teenager, she's moody and climate change is temporary
Mr. Atlas, will you please step out?
I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine,... you’re no Jack Kennedy.
Due to space limitations I will gain be representing Jupiter.
I would like to point out that this candidate has ignored New zealand!
If elected, I promise to save the planet by shrinking it.
Hold on, hold on! What about my needs?
But all she offers is a noun , a verb and "Climate Change"
See for yourself; there’s no evidence of global warming whatsoever.
Despite appearances, I am quite certain the earth is flat!
Despite repeated denials it's obvious my opponent is flat.
And where is "the planet" Pluto, today?
This proves there is no such thing as global warming.
When in debate, I simply prefer to roll over.
This world's too big for the both of us.
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BIGGER..!!!!!!!
Our guest speaker tonight, on the topic of Climate Change, is Gaia.
Global warming is no excuse for all that hot air.
Hey, hey - no need to get so hot-headed. I was just saying that climate change isn't our top priority right now.
And now speaking about global warming, The World!
I can now say with absolute certainty: Earth is as flat as a pancake!
We are the world, we are the children ...
My opponent uses a lot of big words, but what does he have to back them up?
In a sinister move, Presidential Hopeful raises Carbon levels in order to melt his opponent during a nationally televised debate.”
At the top you see the land mass that is causing the system collapse.
You don't scare me
I don't care what you say, global warming does't exist!
I’m for open borders—but all you say is “Build the Canal.”
How do you go to the bathroom?
May I submit to you that I do have a very worldly view of things
No, I did not say that your hot flashes were caused by global warming.
Uhh...How do you raise the microphone again?
Global warming is REAL!! I feel it in my core!
My opponent's arguments are giving a whole new meaning to the flat earth theory!
Stop generalizing!
You may be a world renowned expert, but I think I know my constituents!
Everything gets so blown out of proportion these days.
Now just minute, I think your anti-flat earth bias is showing!
I'm happy to introduce the globe, who will testify that it has a fever.
And another thing...
As you can see, the world is HUGE, the biggest you will ever see. And , as you can also see, absolutely flat.
"The opposition has been overcome by the weight of the world."
Some things will go on, with us or without us.
Hold on you mean there’s no one left to represent your planet?
Be specific.
Why can't we just all get along?
ok, Gaia, speak into the mike
Imma let you finish.
In conclusion, it's cold outside.
Now, tell them about the hurt you felt when you learned you were oval and not a circle.
Is it true what Beyoncé’ says, do girls run the World?
So-you're feeling warmer. Could it be menopause?
And now for the opposing viewpoint...
Uh, oh... looks like spaceship earth just squashed our next speaker.
This isn’t fair! I can’t debate CLIMATE SCIENCE with Mother Earth !!
the old Al Gore in my space act will not do, Sir!
Xenophobic nightmare comes true.
No, we will not listen to your conplaints!
Don't forget without me you are nothing.
...and in the upper left the former 48 States, as they appeared pre-climate change.
I'm letting you know at the onset that I won't be bullied during this debate.
What America needs right now is an outsider.
This... all of the world, is a LIAR!
The SCIENTISTS??  And now even YOU say you're too hot.  Why don't you just turn down the air conditioning?
When you're hot, you're not!
And by 2019, construction was begun on the Great Wall of Canada.
"So you're committed to saving the world, are you? And just why should we believe that you're any different from the rest?"
I'm not flat!
Give us 22 minutes and we'll give you the world.
I agree...the Dolphins should take over the world.
And I say global warming is a hoax!
This is where we were coming from before landing on Mar...
On second thought, if we build a Second Tiny wall just South of the Banana Republics, Americans could once again enjoy their restful evenings. We would in essence be left with only one Sh_t hole country at our Southern boarder instead of eight."
Hold it right there, tubby.
I say to all of you in the audience. Will you elect a flat candidate who continues to use this stage in order to circumvent the major issues?
Folks, please welcome Gaia here - she is in town just to soak up a little atmosphere...
Sir, you speak roundly!
Mr. Earth wait your turn
But the emails...
And now, we will listen to my opponent's view from the world-at-large.
To achieve world peace we must not tolerate the image of North America spitting on South America
And as final proof that what I'm saying is inarguable, please note that my opponent stands mute!
It's not only warming, it's deflating!
Your argument is flat, and your logic is confined in a circle.
People of Earth, you are making it really warm in here.
You claim to be well rounded, but as everyone can see, you just fall flat.
I can see your ice cap, need I say more?
As you can see, Gandalph has turned himself into an giant inflatable globe. I am sure what point he is making, but I think any prick would be able to pop a hole in his argument.
please let me speak, for I am your home.
Ladies and gentlemen, speaking sui generis tonight....!
And do not refer to my opponent as "Homey"!
Trump Tower” here, “Trump Tower” there, “Trump Tower” everywhere
Speaking for myself...
How can we trust my opponent after Krakatoa?
Whoa, let's not let your problems get too big.
Wait! Don't take my spotlight
oh shit i live there
Earth to the rebuttal!
Can we really take the word of someone on NASA's payroll?
For a little help in finally solving the mystery, please join me in welcoming Easter Island to the stage.
Now let’s see if those heads on Easter Island can talk.
The flat earth society won't debate me
If you look closely, the other speaker is now swimming near the Panama Canal.
I was told this will be the most watched debate ever.
Look people. I know that check-in was a nightmare. Please be patient.
Based on the facts before us, my opponent cannot disprove my assertion that black is land and white is water.
City Arts and Lectures is proud to welcome the Pacific Gyre.
My response to that is
if Earth doesn't Love it here 
then he can Leave
OMG! The globe is only two-dimensional.
Welcome to our world.
Another rude inter-eruption.
I am ashamed because I know what my opponent is. He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat.
Now don't you get heated with me!
Right but if I go, you’re coming with me.
Time and again my opponent’s inaccurate projections have distorted reality and that should shake us all to our cores.
She doesn’t even go here!
My opponent has water on the brain.
“I will not debate this any further! Obviously the Earth is flat!” 
-Dr. Flat Earther 

“Mother Earth, your rebuttle?”
-Debate Coordinator

“Now I know you didn’t just call your Momma Flat!”
Oh! Great Mother tell us if we are exceptional?
I tried to friend you on Facebook.
Atlas shrugged, then stumbled.
Global Warming Show & Tell
Guys, I think Earth wants no-deal Universexit...
I must say my opponent looks unusually discomforting today.
What in the World  is This!
Wee man, Americans, all of us, refuse to bow down to dictators!
I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, my opponent is full of nothing but hot air.
Science has not yet provided sufficient evidence!
We now want to kick-off the planetary session of the conference...
If being wordly, were all  you require, take my opponent.
And my opponent, who is pro global warming, is just a hot head.
I've seen global warming, and you sir- are no global warming.
My opponent is making heated arguments using constantly changing half truths.
What I have here today is a revolution in the world of earth science!
Please, there's no need for ad hominem attacks.
Like I said before, you are as flat as your affect!
Sure, you’re worldly, but I figured out how to keep subscribers signed-into The New Yorker websites!
Gaia Rights Debate
I think all of you can see that I am perfectly comfortable standing here; that there is not a single degree of excessive heat coming off of my opponent...clearly she's lying!!
My name is Scott Pilgrim.
To my left is the... competition.
How unfair of you to call me anti-globalist!
At the Global Convention, there was no getting around the fact that the Earth is indeed round.
And so, in conclusion, I challenge you, the world, to commit to be a cleaner and more empathetic place.
My world view?  I see the big picture as if it's standing right in front of me.
Stop orbiting around and firm up your position already!
I don’t care what you say. Global warming is a myth!!
As you can see, there’s a world of difference between our opinions here.”



Sasha Smith, New York Cit
Planet Podium gets heated.
Okay, I admit it - global warming is real and we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions!
It was Stew against the World.
My opponent's foreign policy promises are grossly inflated.
And I submit that the real crisis is that you're full of sh*thole countries!
Just give it up. We all know you’re flat.
I’m King of the world!!
It's time to meet our first panelist on "Planetary Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me!"
Oh, but before they claimed that the science around climate change spoke for itself.
To answer your question, no, not conjoined twins.
This really is a global movement.
My opponent seems needlessly hot under the collar.
Will the distinguished planet yield to a spec?
Sure,North America is a major world power. But weren't you made in China ?
Except for the commies, not so many s-hole countries in this hemisphere.
My  opponent is blue with envy. Even if some think he is deep he is changing and can not be trusted.
No, no, I said, “Africa.”
Shape up or we'll move out.
Hold you comments.
Don’t believe Mother. She’s full of hot air!
You're on sitting on the axis of evil!
You expect people to believe that Natural Order is an argument.
I’m afraid you’re not as big as you used to be.
I don't care what you say, you're not changing!
And I’m against globe-alization too!
Yes, I know the routine; ' HE has, you & me sister, in HIS hands ...Blah, blah,  the WHOLE world in HIS hands....' So, pray tell, how is HE able to 'wash his hands?
Weather as we knew it has left the building........
Our speaker is the world famous bubble gum champ.
That's the classic 'appeal to the masses' fallacy!
Did the dinosaurs vote for that idea, World?
The potentially deleterious consequences of climate change will never be a concept that any right-thinking person will ever warm-up to and embrace.
Ther are two sides on this issue!
Wait, you were supposed to come in later!
I refuse to yield my time to my blue and green colleague.
Your comments mean the world to me!
My opponent is perfectly comfortable with 3rd place. I say, you deserve better.
I mean,aren't people only supposed to be 70% water?
But I like my pickup truck, Mr. Earth
This proves that his beach ball is bigger than any other president's!
...and on this side, we have the perfect example of  'the Haves versus the Have-nots.'"
Remember planets are for people!
...and here we see a crazy chicken and a tornado.
You know, you can be kind of a bully!
You can feel the heat
During this debate on climate policy I
Obviously,my opponent doesn't even belong in this universe!
No, YOU'RE the puppet.
and now- to speak its own case - May I introduce Earth
You may say that I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will be as one…
When I said you were his oyster, I didn't mean it literally.
If  I am elected, I will represent more than just the Americas!
Act like the whole world is about to judge your speech.
I speak for the world.
Harvard, harder to get to than the North Pole.
Mr. Earth, I'm not sure you're seeing things correctly, but clearly you are flatter than the postcard I sent to my friend across your Atlantic Ocean.
Stop following me around the stage.
Atlas, I finally get to debate my opponent
Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent is a flat-earther in globalist clothing.
Trump: There's no global warming as you can see.
I've set up this debate to discuss the merits of scaleability
You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world.
Unfortunately, Mr. Trump is unable to join us for this evening's Meteorological Society " Climate Futures" debate ...so let's move straight on to the weather forecast now and have a look at the chart for the next couple of days...
Do you think you can unilaterally decide on the future of the Earth?
Make North America great again!
My opponent can't even control his own warming.
Now time to welcome Christopher Columbus to the stage, and let him tell us what he thought would happen next.
Protect it? Please! Don't be swayed by my opponents leftist liberal agenda.
My opponent claims his climate is changing, yet he says nothing to defend himself here ... on the world stage.
My opponent in this climate change debate can't even speak up for itself. Why on earth should we believe it?
If I hear you conflate climate and weather one more time, I’m going to roll over you.
Today's hypothetical is God doing a make over."
Nonsense! My argument represents the greater good.
See there the earth is round.
I really hate these debate competitions where I’m supposed to defend the use of fossil fuels.
I've got the world on a podium.
I'm entitled to my opinion!
Cool your rhetoric! Your stormy outbursts will convince no one.
Furthermore, warmer temperatures decrease my steak grilling time and shorten the time it takes for my bathtub to fill up with hot water.
The dream of a post-border continent...of course we'll call it America.
Watch out world, I'm coming for you!
As you can clearly see in this debate, denial of global warming just got the better of my esteemed colleague.
Stop parroting liberal talking points!
Hey, there's no need to be snippy.
We made Americas great again, tomorrow the world.
I am *paying* for this microphone!
now will you please stop interrupting!
And Mexico, no South America will pay for the wall !
And now for our TWED talk!
And finally, we are pleased that Gaia has accepted the position of head of the EPA.
Excuse me, I’m speaking now. You’ll get your turn.
The World can speak for herself!
Mother does NOT always know best!
Keep your cool! You're not THAT big Ms. Earth.
as you already know …
my opponent refutes my explanation
as to who is responsible for global warming
Now it's your turn, Mother Nature.
Now, those running on the Democratic side are…
My opponent wants you to think she looks out all of us. But did you know that billions on Earth are terribly poor — and what's more, they're mostly people of color? So, I ask you this: Who's really looking out for you? Earth? Or me, Pete Buttigieg?
So you want me to explain why I'm thinking of turning off the magnetic field..
I just rolled in from orbit and boy, is my ozone layer depleted!
Don't worry, you've only got the weight of the world on your shoulders.
Before we blame this all on climate change, let's just see where you are in your cycle.
And now welcome our special gue... STOP!
Now, let's hear from planet Earth herself and her opinions on whether Pluto should be a planet or not. Ms. Earth, can you tell us what you think?
Welcome. Be my guest.
God thought it would be better for it to come straight from the horse's mouth.
And here at long last, before you,  is proof of the Southeast Passage!!
Sure! Lord it OVER us!
You appear to be as healthy as can be but our industry is polluted from all the regulations!
I’m Donald Trump!!!
Go West People, Go West!
And we're building a moat around our hemisphere to keep the hot air n.
First my opponent went on about the global economy. Then he ranted about global warming. I say "America First!"
My opponent calls it Climate Change. I call it a flip-flop.
That explains the gaping hole in the wall...
I object! My opponent is lurking again.
Um, actually, Global Warming is fake news; you have no evidence to prove it otherwise.
And I resent, Sir, the implication that I have just flooded you with a bunch of hot air!"
It's just not economically feasible!
Your natural resources?
It is my pleasure to introduce the talk
“The minor challenge society is facing today”
Man needs to take into account, Mother nature has an opinion too.
And if we look to my left, I can show you the world. Shinning, shimmering, splendid”
I have it in good authority that my opponent feels indebted to China.
Who speaks for Earth?
(And thank you, Carl Sagan, for asking us this question a while ago.)
You win, there is global warming plus global shrinkage.
There you go again...trying to get the last word.
Look at you. You ought to sweat off a few pounds.
You’ve no rights because you’re not registered.
I dont care what you look like, I still say your flat!
And you, my friend, or a radical environmentalist!
Your issues are too big, I can't hear any more.
Will you just listen to me mother?  Can't you see the world's changing?
And now, back by popular demand, put your hands together for GOD!
I tell you, I am as diwn to earth as my opponent.
You haven't changed at all.
The next speaker will be satellited in once we have a lnk
My opponent's campaign is a one-issue wonder.
I will destroy you mother!
I’ll agree with one thing my opponent just said: Voters have a critical choice to make next Tuesday.
I know you're upset about the receding hair line, we're working on new treatments.
Stop trying to pull me off my tangent
I don't care how loud you yell sir, I'm always going to be round.
Look! You can see..... " We are the WORLD!!"
Yes, it's the first World End, and is only available until Doomsday!
I knew you'd say, "Proof is staring you in the face", that does not change my argument, climate change is a hoax!"
You had the whole world . Apparently you still have it on your shoulders.
My opponent in today's debate is an old friend I haven't seen for 30 years...all I can say is ,it's a small world.....
AI Maps 4.0 will roll out this Spring
And in 2020, I'll be making America even greater.  ALL of it.
Enough hperglobe!
Look I hate to break it to you but if you’re round then that would make me wrong, which is simply impossible.
I am not a resource. I am the World.
'My opponent is an enemy of the People '
on the other side of the coi
However, my opponent...
Stop. I'll go first. Then, it's your turn.

garygcampbell@comcast.net
I am the Donald and you are not even a grain of sand  in the Universe.
We will now hear from the world champion speaker.
What the hell is going on with Global Waming?
I feel hot
This is not the way New Zealand wanted to get on the map.
My opponent only cares about himself when it comes to his policies.
And my oponit claims to have the weight of the world on his shoulders! But”
.....and that's why you are on a stage now.
And, now, a word from the world. World take it away.
If you're so round, why are you standing still?
You are a cheap recreation of my Mother!
And that little spot in the muddle is Brexit.
A whole new world -a new fantastic point of view...
They're coming by the millions, folks!
As promised; the worldly viewpoint!

Before you continue, what we’re the dinosaurs really like?
I'd like to introduce our keynote speaker, who has a World of comments to share.
Tonight, Earth is on fire!
Holy fucking shit it's the entire Earth and I'm supposed to debate it wtf lol.
I'm sorry, where exactly is your mouth? Or your eyes? It's a small thing, but I like to look people in the eyes when I speak to them.
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
At least Pluto is not Flat
And regardless of the terraqueous knowledge of my opponent...
You don't seem to be going around the sun right now.
It's ideas like those that let the terra-rists win.
When I said. “What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!” I was just being rhetorical.
They're weren't kidding when they said his speech was out of this world
I want to point out that my opponent's fake sunny smile is proof that there is no such thing as climate change.
World, shmorld, after taxes we got what?
My worthy opponent is clearly full of hot air!
Whoa! The small globe!
A flat earth is not really up for debate.
This is the Southland. You can’t express those views.
Clearly we are in agreement.  You seem to be warming up to my belief that fossil fuel consumption is harmless.
WAAA  WAAA WAAA!   All my opponent does is complain!
Hello. I'm Donald Trump.
'"You're no ball of fire either."
Let’s give a rousing welcome to our keynote speaker, The Global Economy!
While you do have a very compelling case supporting Flat Earth, I must remind you that your word is "loquacious".
I'm sure we can all agree ...
Now, direct your eyes to the big blue ball to my left.
It's high time the voice of Earth is heard now.
You may be the entire planet earth, but you're not God. So shut up.
My Opponent maintains he's the salt of the earth!
Your five minutes are up!  Moderator--!
Thank you Earth for your introduction. As you can see the Western Hemisphere matters and we are going to be great again!
My opponent isn't who they say they are. In fact, I have it on good authority they're nothing more than a Van der Grinten projection.
This would be a lot easier if I was flat.
This appears to make my colleague's argument moot
Help me welcome our guest speaker - the creator of the Flat Earth Society!
You're not real, so therefore I win!
Here we have a contemporary, three dimensional interpretation of a Michelangelo, two dimensional rendering found on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
They're All against me, every last one of them!
Indiana Jones and The Temple Doomed By Global Warming
You're damn right I'll go up against you!
Introducing.......World B. Free!!!!!!
And how does your agenda help us?
Mother knows best.”
Lynne Ruffini, West Hurley, N
My opponent is racist.
Please wait until I call on you.
Let me get my lever.
i am for peace, where my opponent is obviously for world
You come here and accuse me of taking money from Big Oil when you’re no stranger to Big Earth
I don't care what you say, I'm right!
Your lectern was only meant for Al Gore.
“Lord save us ... America First!”
Hold on a minute, now.  That's just YOUR opinion!
Excuse me, Globe Guy, but it’s not like you have a say in this any more!
Man has debate with the earth
The last thing the world needs is more north-centric rhetoric.
You don't intimidate me...there is no such thing as climate change.
Get real- with the Wall nearly done and 2% of the world's population behind me, why do I need to listen to a bunch of losers like you?
Today the world is recursive.
All our problems are  here, join my campaign to find a new planet.
According to science, she's not qualified to lead the universe. She can't manage her own house!
I don't see Nations! I see Dictators!
It's all about us
And I see that you have  5,972,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of weight on your shoulders.
Lord, God, what a majority!
Please lower your weather.
World domination is so seventeen century.
Where in the world are we?
Our next speaker has a world of experience in Human Lack-of-Change Studies.
I  see right through all those phony warm feelings you're projecting.
But the A.C.'s on!
I was thinking much flatter.
No matter what the entire world says, I still think it's a Chinese hoax.
Look, the earth has come to take revenge on us for taking its polar ice cap, I really want to say I told you so!
What do you mean Nancy Pelosi sent you to refute the emergency need for a beautiful border wall?
All those running against the GOP incumbent in the 2020 Presidential election, shout, "Facts are not fake news."
And no matter what my opponent thinks...
'Turn around. Show everyone the old earth'.
Love, sweet love, is what you say you need.  What I say is that you need to cool down....
You say you feel bloated?
I did see your Instagram Story yesterday. I agree with you—the whole wide world is officially out of my hands.
Just another Davos-style globalist.
Man: It's not all about you.
Morphing is impressive. But I offer stability!
You've never done one single thing for the American public!
Weltanschauung, Schweltanschauung
At the very least we can save this Earth.
I just don't see any proof of climate change
I should at least be King of the Western Hemisphere, if not the whole world!
And that is why I think the earth is flat
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
As you can see the world is very very bigly.
My opponent is worthy, but easily influenced by fake science.
Your points are falling a bit flat
Holy guacamole, it is about to burst!
But can my opponent promise "Free Pizza Fridays"?
Some say he’s got the whole world 
on his stand but l know better!
You and whose army?!
Yeah, don’t flat-earth yourself.
Frank lost his job and reputation shortly after his misguided attempt at a “Heavenly Body” joke. 
#earthtoo
I think you're being more than a little hysterical
I’ve changed my mind. There is such a thing as climate change!
Does anyone know what this sphere is trying to tell us?
They come in peace, they’re only looking for water, air and shelter.
Just cool off, you hoaxer!!
Yeah, but Columbus was a moron, and anyway that don't prove you ain't flat...
I do not identify this as the earth. The earth should be flat, not like a ball. Every politician knows that.
And now a rebuttal from Terra Cotta
And the Lord Sayeth, "America shall have dominion over all the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air."
I suppose you're going to argue that the environment is more important than the environment.
The real Inconvenient Truth is that my opponent brought globe for his demonstration that is much too large.
I strongly disbelieve my opponent's plan to raise temperatures and wash away my ignorance.
I knew America. America was a friend of mine. Believe me, Senator, you're no American!
America is now GREAT! Promise Made, Promise Kept
And if I am elected that's what you'll get.
I am telling you, and you can believe me. It's fake news!  Your atmosphere is not heating up!
Yes an SUV. What are you driving at?"
My opponent would have you believe the world is his oyster!
May I call you Ted?
No, no, no. It's not DAIS ex machina."
Are you sure climate change is real?
I've been upstaged by a prop!
Please....stop globalizing the solution to climate change!
And now we shall hear from Halliwell, our correspondent who is sheltering near that sqiggly line by the Bering Sea.
When Xi speaks America listens
Think global, vote local politician.
Don't  judge me!
Ok we are going to hear from Earth
With her statement that we all agree that it should be Earth first.
And if you'll look here at our 3D map.
You're such a loser.
Unlike my opponent, I will NOT play into partisan politics!
Your head is so big, it won't fit in the continent of Europe!
Digital, schmigital! I like tangible.
My sixty seconds isn't up yet!
Before the Lorax...
Apparently there is life on other planets too!
I couldn't disagree more with the Senator from Everywhere. . .
Give me a break! That's just a hoax invented by the Chinese.
You heard what I said...climate change is a hoax!
Me: *insert unfunny caption here*
New Yorker: The Finalists
My opponent is a liar
I promise to build a wall to keep out all who do not support social justice in the world.
Your rebuttal?
I'll concede that heat causes expansion, but there's no evidence...
And now our sponsor, Earth, Inc. -- working today for a better tomorrow.
The world speaks, yet we acquiesce.
Okay, is this, like, some kind of Ayn Rand thing? And if it is, should we call an ambulance?
This is God’s view. See how easy it is to see the borders?
I don't care what her record says; I'm here to tell you that she's been flip-flopping for years.
Stop! In the name of the Flat Earth Society!
We didn't come here because of global warming, it was a hoax created by opposition. We came here to escape from Facebook, Google.
Welcome, Mr. Trump!
And if you let them get the Senate and the White House, they'll eliminate all the borders.
What my opponent said is wrong, there’s no such thing called “Global Warming”.
I should have brought back up!
The atmosphere in the room heats up as the Green Party candidate is asked about their views on Pluto's legitimacy
There my opponent goes again, vastly exaggerating the situation."

Or am I taking you out of context?
Wait, you're not our next contestant. We must have you mixed up with Pangea.
. . . and furthermore, if you don't mend your ways, you'll be obsolete in just a few decades.
May our best ever G.P.S. salesman R.I. P.
My main rebuttal? The world is not a podium.
There you go again, avoiding specifics!
Ladies and gentleman...This is your world...
My opponent can say what he will, but if I lose, you lose
Okay, well hang on a minute Bill, let me finish.
Today I invited someone of MY caliber.
Is it getting hotter and hot in here could we mayb-"
"I told you already we are not stopping this debate to get rid of C02!
This is your central conceit, Mr. Trump.
The snowstorm was a little bigger than we anticipated.
Whoa! You need to do something about that cough,
The crushing silence from the United States.
I hereby announce my intention to quit if  you don’t treat me with respect  it’s your call.
It’s about time someone paid attention to me!
As I filibuster, I feel like I carry the wait of the world.
Woah, slow your roll! I let you speak about climate change, but I wanna talk to you about global warming!
Given your history of peaceful debate, I look forward to being slaughtered at the end of this one
Help me, help you!
Ok keep this image in your brain. Now imagine it just a blue ball of water...
My opponent doesn't know the first thing about global warming!
Stop the earth I'm getting off.
My opponent demonstrates an extreme lack of focus!
I can show you, The World!
No, it is not yet your turn to speak
And I say that 70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by Dihydrogen Oxide!
I hope the next time I get a chance to have the floor I won't be interrupted.
And on my right, your left, the representative from the Eastern Hemisphere
And here we see the famous Macondo projection.”
My world is bigger than yours!
You were saying?
Are you going to freeze us or to cook us?
this bitch right here looking so fat, he's looking so fat that he makes jupiter look like a WHITE DWARF!!! haha but for real, without this guy i wouldn't have a career... so let's hear it for global warming! i love you man, i fucking love you!
I'll stop the world and melt with you.
My worthy opponent is Earth, a planet in the Sol System. As you can see it is, of course, flat.
Forget voting red or blue, let's talk green!
Is this the world on your shoulders?
My opponent seems to believe it’s a living breathing organism!
Caps off to you, my friend.
Really? I‘m sweltering over here, and now you tell me the mike was off the entire time?
And on the Seventh Day, we dug the Panama Canal...
And who in the world can argue with a matzoh ball?
With my opponent's all consuming hot air indeed he will blow up our world.
Don't say it!
My opponent clearly lacks foresight on this matter...
If every vote counted, he wouldn't be your president.
In a couple hundred years, this will look like Rodinia again...
And now, for a sketchy view of the world...here’s Bob from our art department.
No, sorry, I can’t hear you.
Oh, yeah ? Well, I have dominion!
I don't care what you science-types say, there are NINE!  Nine planets in the solar system!
Yes, of course, there are lots of other women complaining about this sudden heat from time to time. However, this isn't a reason to change everything right now.
My opponent is obviously exaggerated."
At the latest debate on climate change: “Upon further reflection, Mother Earth makes a valid point and I will stop driving my car immediately.”
With all this green earth talk the world has got above itself.
It's me or the Earth
We needed a roof, but we just built a wall!
Well, the debate is nearly over. Man has summarily destroyed the Earth.
The Midwest "Rules
It really is a National emergency,we really are being over run!
Despite what it says, the world’s roundness is a flat-out lie!
But do you have a Twitter?
These so-called "scientist" also claim that my opponent is *not* flat.
I am the only person here to speak for the planet.  If it's just me,
clearly we are doomed.
My friends, manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people!
You and your oceans ... you’re all wet, you’re always splashing and flooding with your waves and your tides and your deep blue sea.  And I intend to put a stop to it!
Just another liberal fake!  Moses parted a red sea.
...and our specials today are Arctic avocado, Tundra tomatoes, and  your all-time favourite — Frigid Framboise.
They said I was paranoid!!
Clarify for the folks what you meant by 'the bubble bursting.'
I present to you.....the world!
Once and for all the world has come to make it case.
You have no proof your stormy misbehavior is due to your alleged fever!
As you can see the earth is huge.  And some say it's growing.
Vote for me because I know more than anyone in the whole world!
I WILL NOT BE IGNORED!!!
And the biggest loser is!? you guessed it. Us!
You think you are a World Leader ?
I´m hot too. But you need to check your temper, Sharon!
But you wouldn't even know about this "warming", without us telling you!
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the ocean's carbon graphite level is a serious concern.
My opponent would have you believe I am a solipsist!
Elect me and I'll take that weight off your shoulders.
Cheer up Greta Thunberg,
there is HOPE
These globalists don’t care about your or me!
As you can see, and as my former colleague can attest, here we have an example of “global growing”!
Granted, my opinion may not coincide with most !
Wall?Wall? We don't need no stinking walls.
Don't get blown out of shape over climate control.
I accuse my learned opponent of being biased on this matter.
He's got the whole world behind that stand.  He's got the whole world behind that stand.  He's got the whole world behind that stand.  HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD BEHIND THAT STAND!!!
I agreed to debate WENDELL WILLKIE, not his book.
You have corrupted our youth with threats and false promise!
What is this? A world for ants?
Sorry about abuse but we legally have eminent domain here.
Whatever...
As you can see students, Upper Middlewestern nomenclature notwithstanding, cartographic rendering proves there’s really just one Great Lake plus a Great Pond.
It's either greenhouse gasses or me. Whatta ya got to lose?
Try and talk your way out of this Mr. Trump
My opponent is my oyster.
You're big now, but wait until the Blobyack Extract Corporation gets done with you.
The good news is that fossil fuels still have a fighting chance
I stand here at a podium opposite the planet Earth, which is apparently also here to debate.
Make America Great Again
Your climate changes far too quickly; you couldn't possibly be president!
Don’t worry about raising the mike. The U.S. always speaks loudest.
Hello world what do you have to say for yourself.
No puppet. You're the puppet!
OK, you've made your point!
Debate me, coward! You won't.

Olive Branch? That doesn't excuse you chasing around in the Lily Pond.
The creek is back that way.
We don't need your dam help.
You broke it again? It's about time you realize retainers don't grow on trees.
The habitat is that way! Your benightedness incenses me well-nigh abasing myself with trite scatalogics!
It's just one dam thing after another with you, isn't it?
You know the dam rules....only oak trees, no maple.
Do not gnaw on my side of the river, Terry.
You've always been a show-off, Justin Beaver
No, not the hard woods. You'll get the humans mad at us again.

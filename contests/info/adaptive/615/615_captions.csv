I can hear the wife now: "You caught it, you clean it."
Must be another Trump hotel that's underwater
I've finally caught something my wife will let me hang in the living room.
"I hate fishing in the Hamptons".
Too bad it's catch and release. My wife would love this.
We must be at Pier 1.
You're gonna need a nicer boat.
Finally, something my wife will let me mount in the living room.
Those fish are having a ball down there.
Now I wish I hadn't thrown back that Chippendale table.
It's the Trump lure -- it works best with bottom feeders.
Throw it back; we're fishing for mid-century modern.
First, I set the mood.
I tie my own. Why do you ask?
Is that chandelier going to keep getting bigger every time you tell this story?
I'm not surprised. A lot of upscale homes are now underwater.
I think I’ll mount this one on the ceiling.
It’s easier than dusting it.
On the East River, you just get tires.
Had to throw back three sconces and a flashlight, but this one's a keeper.
My wife told me to bring home something nice for dinner.
Looks like the wealth is starting to trickle downstream.
The irony of it is that I told my wife that I couldn't go antiquing.
Picked up this little beauty in the tackle shop at Mar-a-Lago.
Even the East River's gentrifying.
They're fun to catch, but tough to clean.
Nice kitch, Gary.
You can only catch these in alternating currents.
This may not be the best spot for fish, but you can't beat it for ambience.
Incandescent bulbs. Gotta throw it back.
Run-off from the upper east side
Have you noticed how few boots we catch since Brooklyn has been gentrified?
I think I'll toss it back and try for something a little more contemporary.
No no no, I said bring a 'can of beer'
It really comes in handy for night fishing
I use it for night-fishing.
Homes in this area are still underwater.
I like catching them, but I hate cleaning them.
And that, son, is why we fish at Crystal Lake.
I guess I’ll be eating light tonight.
See, this is why I like to fish in the eBay.
Catch and release only. They're impossible to clean.
Catchin' 'em is easy, son. It's cleanin' 'em that's a pain.
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you redo his foyer.
I remember throwing this one back in when it was a bare light bulb.
They say that, before sea level rose, you could walk into any Manhattan hotel lobby and find one of these things.
I don't want tunas that taste good. I want tunas with good taste.
some guys find fishing meditative, but I find it illuminating.
I told you I felt a light tug on my line.
I told you fishing in front of Mar-a-Lago would pay off.
You usually only see these at night.
Not surprised, I heard Trump's hotels are under water.
"I told you Liberace used to fish here".
That's nothing. You shoulda seen the Steinway that got away.
10 hooks, waterproof LEDs, and real crystal. I call it: the chandelure.
I call it the chandel-lure.
If my wife asks, it took all day to clean the chandelier.
My wife said I couldn't go fishing until I cleaned the chandelier. So.......
We have to stop fishing in the Hamptons.
Billy, this is why I hate fishing Mar a Lago.
Well, I finally caught something my wife will like.
Looks like Trump Towers finally went under.
Finally, something my wife will let me put up in the living room.
I was hoping to land something a little more contemporary.
I guess that's what you get for fishing at Pier 1.
I started off tying my own flies and things just got a little out of hand.
I see the bait, but where’s the switch?
It's a tradeoff: I clean the chandelier; she let's me fish.
That's what happens when you fish too close to Mar a Lago.
Beginner's luck -- all I've been getting are wall sconces.
I threw back the sconces, but this bad boy is definitely a keeper.
Catching these things is always more fun than cleaning them.
I like to make their last meal special.
Believe me, this is how you catch mermaids.
"I used both - bait AND switch".
I'm sitting on the dock of eBay...
It's a Lamprey!
Good thing it s kitsch and release!
Too bad. Chandelier season doesn't open till next week.
Yet another reason I hate fishing in The Hamptons.
I hate fishing near the Hamptons.
By George, you’ve found the wreckage of Mar-a-Lago! Back in 2018, they warned him about the consequences of global warming, but did he listen?
I not only want fish that taste good, I want fish with good taste.
Normally I use this for night fishing
I promised you we'd go fishing, I promised Mom I'd clean the chandelier
Octopi really are the masters of camouflage.
That's strange. They usually only come out at night.
Not bad - but you should've seen the Tiffany Lamp that got away.
She did say she wanted something fancy for dinner...
I forgot to tell you this pier sits over something they used to call Mar-a-Lago.
This is what happens when you use caviar for bait.
Go ahead and cast while I set the mood.
Before global warming, used to be a hotel here.
...and this here lure I got outta Scott Pruitt's tackle box.
Fish? You want pier #2 then.
She asked me to wash the chandelier -- she didn't say how.
Teach a man to fish, something, something, chandelier.
I told you we shouldn't fish down stream from Mar-a-lago.
You are definitely going to want to mount that one.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and he can refurbish his living room
All I have is light tackle.
She said, "You can go fishing after you clean the chandelier."
Didn't I tell you we'd find the perfect chandelier at Pier 1?
Definitely invasive. They've driven the Swarovskis clean out.
Must be a pretty fancy school.
Judging by the fight it put up, I could have sworn it was a wall sconce.
See, I told you I felt a light tugging on my line.
That's nothing. I caught a Chihuly here last summer.
This is called the Liberace lure. I’m hoping to catch a Steinway.
I know, she's a beauty, but if it has less than 20 lights, I have to throw it back.
I call it a chande-lure.
My buddy recommended a bait shop on the Upper East Side.
How many years since Mar-a-Lago was lost to rising sea levels?
Dang, looks like my line is baroque again.
Damn! Another one!
We’re gonna need a bigger dining room.
Oh no, they're a bitch to clean.
I do all my shopping on-line.
Catching one is easy, cleaning it is the real work.
If it's under a thousand watts, you have to throw it back.
It's about time. I've had to throw back two desk lamps earlier today.
We are going to see well tonight.
The name of my new lure, Hank? The 'Liberace'!
Apparently the flood did reach the upper east side.
I told you this was easier than going to IKEA.
Since I caught the armoire this is the only bait I ever use.
No,I said bring cans of beer.
If we go further out, we may be able to catch the entire living room set.
Too bad you threw back that electric eel.
It's my newest lure, I call it "The Liberace".
Finally something my wife will let me bring into the house.
Just my luck,Chandelier season doesn't open until Saturday.
A few more weekends and I'm done remodeling.
I was hoping for something more contemporary.
Got caught on the alternating current.
Sometimes, I hate The Hamptons.
It tends to lure a higher class of fish.
This is why I don't like fishing in The Hamptons.
They're fun to catch but I detest cleaning them.
Looks like we're having a light dinner tonight.
I don't want tunas that taste good. I want tunas with good taste.
Fishing's good here in the eBay.
We're gonna need a bigger bucket.
If you can't drain the swamp, you might as well catch what's in it.
Got these at the Mar-A-Lago bankruptcy sale - cheaper than worms and work great on bottom feeders. Last week I caught Mitch McConnell.
I'd keep it--but my wife hates to clean them.
I assume it’s a Waterford.
They're fun to catch, but hell to clean
That’s the last time I use glow worms.
Now all I have to do is catch an electric eel!
I guess this is why they call it the eBay.
I did borrow Scott Pruitt's fishing pole. Why do you ask?
You should have seen the Steinway that got away.
I used a chandelure.
Throw it back. We need a Tiffany Lamp.
I think I've found the Titanic
Looks like Scott Pruitt is redecorating again.
Hm. Hook, line, and fixture.
Let's see if the hedge fund managers are biting.
Seems this is where Mar-a-Lago was prior to the sea level rise.
Honestly, can't I catch just one thing that's mid-century modern?
If it doesn't have at least 12 candles, you're supposed to throw it back.
Looks like those fish are having a ball.
They stopped biting on the disco ball.
Looks like we're eating light tonight.
Alison loves it when I come here. Last week I caught a Dinette Set.
I think I’ll mount it over the dining room table
Looks like it’s two candles over the limit.
Hmm, Debbie says if I catch it, I clean it. So, back it goes.
The glitterati are biting today.
Yeah, I thought I felt a light tug on the line.
Sorry, French, mid-18th century is on the 'catch and release' list.
Yes, I think your wife WILL notice that it's gone
If it’s 40 watts or less you have to toss it back.
What did you use for bait?
Well, this is what we get for fishing in the Hamptons.
It’s how you catch the orange-headed Trumpfish.
You know what they say Bob, 'if it ain't Baroque, don't fish it.'
No, I don't expect to catch anything. My wife asked me to clean the damn thing.
I think I'll keep it and mount it on the ceiling.
The lure's not cheap, but the fish are fabulous.
It's part of the 'catch and redecorate' program.
Jon, I’m gay.
You should have seen the candelabra that got away.
I'm not sure if I should switch my bait or bait my switch.
She said I had to clean it before I could go fishing.
I'll mount this one in the dining room.
It's always in the last place you look, isn't it?
It appears these fish are more sophisticated than we thought.
I normally catch and release, but you've seen how drab my foyer is.
I have a feeling this is about as close to winning the lottery as I'm going to get.
I told you I felt a light tug!
We're gonna eat like kings tonight.
Lamprey, obviously.
Throw it back. Nobody will ever believe you.
Sure, it’s a bit ostentatious, but I find it attracts a better class of fish.
It attracts a better class of fish.
First time fishing in the Hamptons?
i remember my grandfather telling me about a hotel that used to exist here near the old coastline... what was it called now.... Mor Lego? ...something like that.
Looks like the Neptunes are renovating again.
We used to catch them twice this size when I was a kid!
I only catch the best fish with this. Classy ones. The biggest fish. Huge.
It's called "The Melania". Guaranteed to catch clownfish.
I guess it makes sense...it’s a Waterford.
Well that's the last time I use caviar for bait
Well now I feel under-dressed.
This is the bait they use at Mar-a-lago.
They told me to use light tackle for fishing off the dock.
'If I snag that electric eel its going to get interesting."
If it's Ikea I'm throwing it back.
It's an affluent river.
It tends to attract the more upscale fish.
It's called the Chande-lure.
She said I couldn't go fishing until I cleaned the chandelier.
It fought like a lamprey.
The Liberace 910 lure... good choice Herb.
Great. As if cleaning a fish isn't hard enough.
You can’t eat it , but your wife will definitely let you fish again tomorrow!
Looks like we'll be having a light dinner tonight.
How's the current here?
I'm after the elusive Orange Trumpfish which is attracted to tacky, glitzy lures. It's a trash fish, an invasive species, absolutely no good for much of anything, but it preys on the useful native stock and we're trying to get rid of it.
The guy at the bait shop said the Liberaces are running.
Last week sconces were running.
Moving to the Upper East Side has changed you, Marvin.
The bait-shop said to use light tackle.
Yesterday the refrigerators were biting.
I knew I shouldn't be using light tackle.
Finding a Mother's Day gift while fishing may be the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Did I mention this spot used to be a Trump Tower before global warming?
Damn! I'm only licensed for candelabra.
Just tell her you found it online.
Wow! You caught that with a 10-watt bulb?
Even the East River's gettin' gentrified.
Shame to throw it back, but incandescents are illegal now.
You think it’s the same one we caught earlier?
Trust me; you get a whole different class of fish.
A classic case of bait and switch.
They sell it at the Mar-a-Lago Bait & Tackle Shop.
My wife is going to kill me. She made me promise I wouldn't catch anything she's have to clean.
Finally, a catch my wife will be happy with.
Well that explains the bioluminescence.
First, you've got to set the mood.
I once caught a candelabra that was twice this size.
Liberace gave it to me. He never caught anything with it either.
It must have been a really ugly divorce.
Throw it back. Too gauche.
Bioluminescence.
This beats dusting the damn thing!
No wonder Liberace fished here all the time.
It’s called the Chande-Lure™, patent pending.
My wife might actually let me mount this one in the house
I had to release the bedside lamp, but this one looks big enough to keep.
Welcome to the Hamptons. You won't catch that in the East River.
This will go great with the table and chairs I caught last week.
So, Liberace sleeps with the fishes?
How long have you been baiting with cocktail shrimp?
This one is going on the ceiling.
I don’t think the Titanic is as far down as they thought.
The trick is casting without blowing out the candles..
I was here all day yesterday and only caught two night lights.
You're gonna need a bigger table
The East River cleanup is working. Still no fish but the pollution is classier.
"Hmm, throw it back or completely change the dining room?
They tell me fishing is best when you catch the first light.
It’ll look great mounted.
It's even more surprising that it is still lit.
If you give a man a chandelier he has light for one room, but if you teach a man to fish for chandeliers he has light for his entire life
Now, I know why they call it crystal lake.
I want to attract a higher class of fish.
Last week the Eames chairs were running.
Your rod doesn't hold a candle to mine.
It's not just the bait. . .it's the ambience.
So typical. Extravagant lifestyle but living under water.
Yeah, but who's gonna clean it.
Too polluted for fish, but great for getting the tarnish off silver.
Yeah, they work, but they're a bitch to tie.
So THATS what a 1000 dollar lure looks like.
My last time fishing the Hamptons.
That's the thing about Mar-a-Lago. Fishing's good, but lotsa junk.
I hate fishing at Mar-a-Lago.
It tends to catch a better class of fish.
It’s the easiest way to clean it.
The mystery, Rick, isn't how it was in twelve feet of water under a dock in a lake. The mystery is how the candles are still lit.
Found it.
And this, son, is why we call her “Lake Superior.”
Just my luck! Chandelier season doesn't begin until next week.
Liberace used to fish here.
Yeah. The wife'll probably be mad, but I couldn't find my tackle box.
You say it's called a Chandelure?
Now she’ll probably want me to fish for the matching table lamp.
Everything’s gotten tackier since Trump was elected.
I'm gonna try the menorah instead.
Finally something my wife will let me hang up.
I don’t think I want to see what you catch with that lure.
I'm surprised - I was using a lure for floor lamps.
Remember when sea levels were normal and all we ever caught was fish?
"It's called 'The Liberace Lure'".
I think it’s a metaphor.
Someone must be underwater on their home loan.
I am trying to attract a better class of fish......
Just once, I'd like to catch an actual fish.
I guess that’s why the locals call it eBay
Why couldn't it be a Chihuly?
More crap from the Titanic
Holy mackerel, I think I caught a Swarovski!
It might be from the lost casino of Atlantis.
It's better for night fishing.
They're not biting. The lighting's not right.
When he touted how Climate Change was just Fake News, he forgot how close Mar-a-Lago was to the water.
So, what kind of wine should you serve with this?
There must be a current here.
I don't know whether to throw it back or redesign my dining room.
Probably from the White House. They’ve thrown everything else out!
My wife told me to clean the chandelier and I was thinking--why not?
Another antique store gone under.
I'm sitting on the dock of eBay...
I only use this lure for special occasions.
You're laughing now, but you owe me fifty bucks if this works
Its the most beautiful treble hook in the world. But I have to admit, its a bitch to cast.
It's called a Liberace Spinner
Frank, you add a touch of class to every occasion.
You should have seen the marble fireplace that got away.
Not how I expected light tackle to work.
Amazing fight this one gave...like it knew it was going to end up in the dining room...
They're going to call me a liar.
Oh, that’s right, we’re right over where Park Ave. was, back in the 2020’s.
I think it's time to hang it up.
Looks like I’ll be eating light tonight.
Before global warming, Mar-a-Lago was under this spot.
Well, at least it goes with the dinette set I caught yesterday.
Fishing in the Hamptons never gets old.
It's called a chandelure.
I just hope that my wife doesn't notice it's gone.
Well, we may not have much to eat tonight, but we'll be dining in style.
They must be draining the swamp near here.
I guess our rising seas have reached a new ceiling.
I said get fish that taste good, not fish with good taste.
Last week I caught a fifteen pound sconce.
Never mind hanging it on your wall, hang that sucker from the ceiling.
It's the light at the end of the channel
When you said bring light tackle, I thought you were joking.
Yeah, it's a keeper, but they're a bitch to clean.
I said we shouldn't fish from pier one!
Well, they said the water was crystal clear...
Much faster than dusting by hand.
I’ve gotta stop using caviar for bait.
You caught it, you clean it.
Where did they say Titanic went down?
Mar-a-lago, 2250.
''Well I did tell the wife I'd bring something home for the dinner table''
It's not dinner, but it might work in the dining room.
You caught it, you clean it.
I call this my 'chandelure.'
The electric eels love it.
I almost caught a two foot sconce here two weeks ago but it got away.
The guys are right, Pete. Money has changed you.
I told you we were too close to Mar-a-Lago.
It doesn't catch many fish, but the fish it catches are simply fabulous.
You're gonna need a bigger cooler.
Maybe next time we should fish a little further away from Mar-a-Lago.
Fishing near The Hamptons has its own reward.
First thing I've ever caught my wife won't mind cleaning.
I found this fishing lure on Trump.com
I started with a simple spoon lure and things just kind of escalated from there.
You’ll have to throw it back, you’re over the watt limit.
I shouldn’t have used caviar.
It's time to make the ocean great again.
You want to get them in the mood first.
These things are a bitch to clean.
Too small, throw it back in.
I know you like expensive lures Bob, but this is ridiculous.
Throw it back, it has incandescent bulbs.
I see you bought the new Liberachi lure.
Catch and release or catch and restore ?
This is a great spot. I furnished my whole apartment here last year.
You shoulda seen the credenza that got away!
But it will go well with the baby grand piano I caught last week.
I threw a set of Royal Doultan back last week.
It's just a more elaborate "bait with a switch".
I’ll bet it’s the sconce I threw back last summer.
This has “Mob” written all over it.
Again?!
Well they said the water here was crystal clear.
Son, for every one of these you come across, you're going to catch a lot of flashlights.
So this is where the Mar-a-Lago used to be, huh?
Wow, I guess Venice really is sinking!
You're a miserable fisherman, but you have exquisite taste.
I'm going to release it. Too hard to clean.
Just another bait & kitsch
Wow, that Liberace lure really works!
I don’t know if I should throw it back or take it to Antiques Road Show.
The EPA doesn’t care about light pollution.
It's a chande-lure.
Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, his wife takes the house.
We have to release it if it's LED.
Yeah, this was Liberace's place before the climate changed.
I've got nothing. Any nibbles on that harpsichord?
Suddenly I feel a little underdressed
Best thing for lampreys.
I call it a chande-lure.
Nice lure. You fishin' for debutantes again?
This is the last time we fish in Connecticut.
I told my wife I went antiquing.
Great. Another one.
Finally, something that my wife will allow me to mount.
But when I tell this story, it’s going to be an eighteenth-century original.
Worms are great, but I prefer to offer a complete dining experience.
So how long have you been fishing at Pier 1?
We gotta stop fishing at Mar-a-Lago.
I think it's a cousin of the lantern fish.
Those clown fish have some sense of humor.
I'm going for the lamprey.
I'll let the wife clean this one.
I’d throw it back, but it’s perfect for the foyer.
Sure I did lots of acid in college. Why do you ask?
Swell! Now we can fish all night.
Whoa that’s nice. And they say our oceans are full of trash
told you not to bait it with that electric eel
It's fine, my wife can cook anything.
Yep. It's a classic bait and switch.
Why would a mermaid be interested in a worm?
I think I'll call it the chande-lure.
It could be from an offshore account.
If this doesn't catch a Liberace nothing will.
I've heard they're murder to clean.
I'm gonna throw it back. They're too hard to clean.
If it's not a Swarovski i'd throw it back.
Poseidon or Titanic?
"It's a little gilded lure I made to attract the elusive Trumpfish, a real big bottom feeder!
Throw it back it's too hard to clean.
Guess you're right. Mar a Lago was ' round here before the ice caps melted.
The fish are having a ball today.
Catch and release, my ass.
I'm beginning to come around on the climate change debate.
I caught it with a 7-watt LED orange-glo specialty bulb.
If it’s not Baccarat I just catch and release.
So that's what happened to Mar-a-lago.
Well, this casts fishing in a whole new light!
Until now, I hadn't really appreciated sea glass.
Why, last year it was just a little table lamp when I tossed it back.
Darn Global Warming - there used to be something called Trump Tower down here.
Nuts! This is a catch and release area.
Trump Tower is still under water .
I finally caught one that my wife may let me mount!
I told you gentrification was gonna ruin this spot.
It works great, but I'm constantly having to throw back interior designers.
Yeah, they're big, but really tasteless.
Damn light pollution.
See if you can hook the grand piano.
I hate fishing at Mar-a-Lago.
On the plus side, I told my wife I was going shopping.
I could see mounting it in the dining room.
Be careful what you fish for
Hey Bob, shouldn’t you use an extension cord instead of fishing line?
Why do we still go fishing in The Hamptons?
We know about their schools, I guess now they have ballrooms !
I knew it was a mistake to use light tackle
I think they can tell it's not real crystal
"I told you Liberace used to fish here".
I don't care about catching fish. I just like the ambiance.
The dining room tables were really hitting yesterday.
You misunderstood when I said fishing would cast a new light on retirement.
It's about time. I've had to throw back two desk lamps earlier today.
LIMERICK: One morning while fishing for bream...The guys pulled up something glassine..."It is very pretty,..But I bet they taste shitty...And my wife says they're not easy to clean."
Looks like we'll be having a light dinner tonight.
Back before the waters rose, this was a pretty ritzy neighborhood.
So that's why they call it Waterford crystal.
I'm pretty sure the bait shop didn't suggest 'allure'.
Fish love it. Most of ‘em grew up hearing stories about the Titanic ballroom.
I’m hoping to catch a socialite.
I'm mainly fishing for compliments.
I caught a nice foyer with it last year.
Marilyn's been hounding me to clean the chandelier, so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone.
I never believed that it was totally dark down there
Make sure it's not plugged in!
Did I ever tell you about the time I went fishing with Liberace?
We gotta stop fishing off the Upper East Side.
It was a big fixture in a small pond.
It felt heavy when I was reeling it in, but it’s actually pretty light.
Actually, it's high-end mermaid bait.
It went right for the plug.
I use 100 dollar bills for bait...last week I caught a Tiffany lamp!
my decorator recommended this place
The fish here won't bite unless they know you've got money.
Yeah, I'm using light tackle...
I found it on the internet. It's called a chande-lure.
She's a beauty all right, but sadly, chandelier season doesn't open until next Tuesday.
She won't clean that either.
Catch and release, or catch and regift?
Eight bulbs, it's a keeper.
Nice catch.” “Yah, but they’re hard to clean’
What ever happened to liberace's yacht?
My new strategy is to lull them into a false sense of prosperity.
It’s called the Liberace lure, but it looked a lot smaller in the brochure.
Well, I must admit . . . he did at least make fishing great again.
You think your wife will let you mount this one?
It would look great in my dining room but I'm over my limit.
Well, it’s the first thing I ever caught that my wife might like.
If I let it go, I won't have to clean it.
I thought I felt the tug of the nouveau riche.
I'm finally bringing home something my wife will like.
Very interesting. I spotted a school of them yesterday, out by the lighthouse.
It was a compromise, she said I could go fishing if I helped clean the house.
Your ceilings are too high - throw it back.
One of those Trump lures?
No one's gonna believe me, but I'm gonna tell it anyway.
Did you ever start doing something, and forget what you were doing right in the middle of it?
Can you think of an easier way to wash it?
Well, this is disappointing. I was trying to catch a lantern fish.
I call it the Liberace lure.
Makes you see fishing in a whole new light.
It's the Chande-Lure; it came with the Basso-Matic.
I read somewhere that folks were having good luck with light tackle this season.
Cheapest Mothers Day present ever.
I suggest that you come up with a better story on Antiques Roadshow.
You should’ve seen the fishxture that got away!
I prefer light tackle.
Wow, what kind of bait did you use?
Me? I’m fishing for lamprey.
You should have seen the one that got away.
If you catch her you may not be able to afford her.
My wife said I could go fishing as long as I washed the chandelier first.
I don't know about a mermaid but you might catch Liberace.
Took me three months to tie this fly!
It’s spawning season and they can’t resist the ambiance.
The guy at the bait shop suggested light tackle ... do you think it's too much?
Why am I not shocked?
Just one electric eel and this baby'll light up like Christmas.
Sorry son, looks like we're in for another light supper.
This will look great over the mahogany dining set I caught last week.
Hey, Mr. Easily Distracted, your line's behind you.
Wow! What's the chances in catching an 1800's ormolu 32-light chandelier by Pierre-Philippe Thomire on a worm!
This is what you meant by a little light fishing?
We're gonna need a higher ceiling.
Lucky sure, but do you know how hard it's gonna be to catch the replacement bulbs?
Beginner’s luck
Nice catch Dad, but there is no way Mom is cleaning that!
Looks like the Liberaces are running.
...the Wife, is on this "re-purposing" kick.
That should go well with the beaded tapestry you caught yesterday.
At least my wife will actually want to hang this one.
Bet you wish you hadn't thrown back the chifforobe now.
I don,t think that is what they meant when they said use a lighter bait.
Googled “bright shiny lures”
Teach a man to decorate and his wife will ask him to fish instead.
You want to set the right mood.
Maybe my wife will let me mount this one.
Too bad it’s catch and release.
I think you misunderstood “light tackle.”
You catch better stuff on the East Side.
Now I wish I'd kept that electric eel.
I was right. We're over Mir-a-lago. Went under in 2050.
Well you said you wanted to do some light fishing
I'll set the mood, you go ahead with the appetizers.
I told you to get me "a lure" not "allure".
My wife got the house
Last week I almost caught a memorah twice the size.
I know it’s catch and release, but this would look fabulous in my dining room.
This is the last time I fish off of Mar a Lago
I’ll mount it on the ceiling.
Cause it's a great spot for lampreys.
We really have to stop fishing next to Mar-a-Lago.
Not sure. It might be a lamprey.
So this is where they drained the swamp.
I love fishing, but I spend way too much on lures.
Throw it back. It’s a chandelier. We’re fishing for candelabra.
Give a man a fish, he can eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, he can furnish his home for a lifetime.
I’d toss it back, last thing you need is another chandelier.
If it has greater than 24 bulbs, you have to throw it back
Is it a lamprey?
I guess some of them live pretty well down there.
It's a lure for fish that have no taste.
Hey Hal? You ever wonder what they're really doing down there?
You said you're pretty much a fixture on this dock, but this is ridiculous.
Sure is a big one! Last week I only caught a sconce.
I was really hoping for something more Art Deco
Nice going, Dan. You just ruined a bluefin's dinner party.
This must be part of the East River revitalization project.
Fish or cut crystal as they say.
Well this could be enlightening.
I'm using a silver spoon
I was using a Louis XIV lure.
We'll get an electrician to gut and clean it.
You ever buy a lure then think, "How'm I gonna cast this thing?"
I'm using light tackle
You should'a seen the one that got away.
before Global Warming, I think this was Mar-a-Lago.
its too small. throw it back
My wife asked me to bring back fine dining for dinner.
What’s weird is that it’s the second one.
I'll be eating light for dinner.
I figured I might as well use it for something since I can't find the incandescent bulbs.
At least it's not the kitchen sink.
I am trying to attract a better class of fish......
well , at least we know the water is crystal clear.
Just in time for Mother's Day !
Last week I caught a dining room set with six chairs. Good spot!
My grandpa taught me to fish, he was an interior decorator.
This is how I caught your mother.
It's a custom chande-lure.
Any other bright ideas?
If you want to catch a fish that tastes good, you have to catch a fish with good taste.
Can I borrow one of your lures?
The electric eels can't resist it.
I know it’s a keeper, but you should have seen the one that got away!
My wife said to bring home something light for dinner!
I was hoping to bring something home for a fancy dinner, but not this fancy.
Strangest thing happened the other day. Fish spoke to me. Swore he could play the piano if only I could get him a chandelier. How could I say no?
Did Phantom finally close?
I'm gonna mount it in my dining room!
My teacher says this place used to called the upper west side, before all the icebergs melted.
The current isn't strong enough here.
Son, do you remember if the box said “chandelier” or “chande-lure”?
Going with the light tackle today, Herb?
This might actually look nice mounted on the ceiling.
It helps the fish see the bait.
Just my luck—chandelier season starts next week
I thought you used the piano bait, Jim.
Worms in Jersey; crystal on Nantucket.
Some fish for the ones that taste good, I go for the ones with good taste.
At least it's not Jimmy Hoffa.
My Dad told me to try a flashier lure.
Looks like the fixtures are biting today.
That's what I get for using light tackle.
Hey, what's the size limit for these things?
Promised my wife I'd bring home something she wouldn't mind cleaning.
I’ve got more time for fly tying since I retired.
There must be an easier way to dust this thing.
Fish livin’ like that? No wonder they’re so expensive.
The prices are great, but this is the last time I shop at Sam's Bait 'n Switch.
Watch your head when I cast this baby out.
I'm tellin' ya, that Liberace, he sleeps with the fishes
Maybe I'd get a few nibbles on eBay.
The guy at the bait shop tried to get me to switch to LEDs, but I'm a traditionalist.
Too bad , I'll have to throw it back. Chandelier season doesn't begin until fall.
I guess I’ll have a light dinner.
This lure attracts DC sharks, Mar-a-Lago guests and other bottom feeders.
I’m trying to attract a better school of fish
When I asked if you had a light, that wasn't what I meant.
Yes it is hard to cast, but it’s very effective for night fishing!
Can you believe some people thought winning the lottery would change me?
I'm throwing it back—it's tasteless.
I call it the chandel-lure.
We’re gonna mount this whopper right above the dining room table.
No wonder fish are getting so expensive.
It fought more like a candelabra than a chandelier.
I chose Amazon's latest delivery option.
You have to toss it back if it's under 100 watts
If you want to catch the big fish they have to be impressed.
Looks like another bank went under...
I use a heavy gauge line and old Phantom of the Opera CDs as bait.
If it doesn't have at least 12 bulbs, I will have to release it
I couldn't think of a better way to wash off the dust.
They're drawn to the light, but it's the ambience that captivates them.
Another one of those invasive species from France.
I'm thinking I'll call it The ChandeLure.
Through fishing comes enlightenment.
Well, the wife won't mind cleaning this one.
Damn! I've already caught my limit of chandeliers.
The one I caught last year was bigger.
Remind me never to fish at Mar-a-Lago again...
Better release it. Baroque is endangered.
Things are a little different here in Mar-a-Lago.
Chandelier or candleabra? That's your first question?
Invasive species.
Well, getting them hooked on crystal is the easy part.
Teach a man to fish and he'll never be in the dark.
I was hoping for something more mid-century modern.
Last week I caught an armoire.
Just don't contradict me when I tell everyone it could have filled a grand ballroom...
Another one?
After dark, I add a disco bobber.
I think it really ties the pier together.
I guess we're eating light tonight
Unless this makes it into the New Yorker, my wife will never believe me.
I believe the trickle down economy is beginning to take hold.
Don't be a fool, it's clearly an octopus in drag.
It will be hard to explain this on Antiques Road Show.
The trout are gearing up for antique roadshow again.
Told you Miami used to be here.
They can't resist the lure of antiques.
Catch or release?
That's not a Walleye, it's a Waldorf.
This one might look nice mounted in the dining room.
Ya think that's why they call it Crystal Lake?
It's the only bait that works for sole almondine in a bechamel sauce
Didn't I say this would happen when the 1% moved in upstream?
I would have preferred something less formal.
Fishing near The Hamptons always pays off.
Who do you hope to catch? Marie Antoinette?
Darn, I was fishing for a new set of tires
Last time I’m using caviar as bait!
I've got to stop using those electic eels as bait!
We are going to need a larger bucket.
Just bait. No switch.
I’m gonna catch me one of them real housewives.
Figures, this lake was built on Liberace’s old estate.
That's what you get when you're just sittin' on the dock of eBay.
It’s my special lure for night fishing.
I find that I get more bites when I improve the ambiance.
The guy at the Mar-a-Lago bait shack said this is the only thing that works.
The hard part is keeping the candles lit
First, you have to set the mood.
Once it's battered and deep fried, no one will know the difference.
No wonder I've had no nibbles. The worm fell off.
It says Mar-a-Lago Ballroom. Must have been near the old coastline.
We must be about where Midtown was, back in 2030.
When I tell the guys tomorrow, it's gonna have 30 lights.
I call it a heavy bait and light switch.
This was a nice neighbood before the ocean level got so high.
I used caviar for bait.
Law says we gotta throw her back, Chet, she’s under fifty lumens.
That's not what I meant when I told you to bring light tackle.
Too bad we have to release anything incandescent.
Ah, the old bait and switch...
Gone fishing in the 1% pond
I always get confused: is it flotsam or jetsam?
If you've got about a year I can teach you to tie a fly like this.
“Are you using a chandelure?
It felt heavy but turned out to be light.
This? - This is a tiddler, you should see the one I caught at Versailles.
Now if you just get something to put 'on' the table, we'll be all set.
I used nightlights instead of nightcrawlers for bait.
Oh, I don’t want to catch them, I just like to watch them waltz.
Darn it, I'll have to throw it back. It's still credenza season.
I'd better throw it back. My wife only likes mid-century modern.
Too bad this is a catch-and-release lake. That would look nice in your home.
This is what happens when your neighborhood goes minimalist.
Looks like we're having a light dinner tonight.
This is what I get for using light tackle.
Lures are OK, but what really attracts fish is mood lighting.
Fishing over Mara Lago 2078.
My philosophy always has been, 'Go big or go home decor.'
If that's not successful you might switch back to worms.
Catch all the bottom-feeders you want. I’m after the one percent.
You're going to need a bigger Dining Room.
This is the only place around you can still get incandescent.
This is nothing;last season I went hunting for rabbits and shot a stove.
Just my luck. This does not match the guilded tole sconces with ancathus leaves I caught yesterday.
This one I'll have to mount on the ceiling.
Yes, I used to go fishing with Trump. Why do you ask?
I'm starting to wonder if this lure isn't a little too, oh, flashy.
Looks like the overspending at the EPA is finally starting to pay off.
It doesn't catch a lot of fish, just the top one percent.
This will illuminate my collection of old boots quite nicely.
Nobody wants the family heirlooms anymore.
You never know what you're gonna' catch fishin' off Mar-a-Lago
Be careful what you fish for
Son, this is from Trump's Mara Largo Resort. It's about 30 feet below us because he thought rising sea levels were a myth and/or Chinese fake news hoax.
No luck yet. How's the Edwardian chair working?
I've tried everything else; if this doesn't work I'm gonna hang it up.
I'm trying to catch a certain class of fish.
The wife won't mind getting this one mounted.
In these waters, its mostly 19th century.
Nope, still nothin’.
When I said the fish had good taste, I meant for eating.
Dang, if I bring this home, my wife will want to join us fishing.
It's called a chandelure.
You know, I warned them about building McMansions too close to the water.
I've always had good luck fishing with light tackle.
I think we've found the lost continent.
What in the world do you think they do down there, after we go home?
And I used to doubt sea level rise.
Well Mr. Pence, now I know where Melania "stored" Ivana's decor.
This must be the sunken living room
You using glow worms?
It's more sporting to use a light tackle
I guess there is something to that "rising sea levels" thing.
I think we may have found the Titanic.
"I hate fishing in the Hamptons".
Annnnnd one more dip will rinse off the glass cleaner.
They say this is the spot where Trump Tower was back in the 21st century.
It’s better when the sun is out. The prisms really attract the rainbow trout.
You were right about those glow-worms, Earl.
Nope. Anything under a Tiffany I have to throw back.
I call it the Liberace lure. The fish don't put up much of a fight but boy do they put on a show.
It's called ambience.
Seems like this bait's in need of a switch.
Not again.
I think it's one of those lantern fish.
You still a Titanic denier?
You're right, I can't hold a candle to it.
Gunning for fish with good taste, Charlie?
Cleaning this thing will be a bitch
"Ahh dang it, another one. That's my fifth chandelier this week. I hate this pond." (Jack, age 9)
You gotta romance 'em a little bit first.
Guess I was right to use light tackle today.
Mermaids are not going to be attracted to your slimy worms.
The guy at the tackle shop recommended I use something big and shiny
So, you're a fixture at this spot huh?
I can't catch a break today, I have the same chandelier in my dining room.
Contemporary revival, toss it back.
I'm always catching big kitsch in a little pond.
I though global warming was a hoax too, 'til I started catching these things.
If you want to eat caviar, you have to use the right bait.
Could be from Trump Tower; it's under water these days.
That’s nothing. Last month, I caught a Tiffany lampshade.
It's from Donald Trump's new line of bass lures.
It works better than worms, especially at night.
You can have it. I already caught my limit.
I think you should mount it in the foyer.
Great! Now we can fish past sundown.
I got it in the divorce.
That’s what happens when you use a WASP for bait.
Don't you have one of these mounted on your ceiling?
It’s so much easier to bring the table to the farm.
I was hoping to mount a bass on the wall, but I guess this could go in the dining room.
It's what they call a ChandeLure
Remember, we’re fishing in the Hamptons.
Buoyant? I thought you said flamboyant.
I didn't know Liberace was buried at sea.
What I find more astounding is that the candles are still lit!
They're beautiful, but not very good eating.
I almost forgot. Some time back, this is where Mar-a-Lago was.
Most troll, while I...seduce.
So this was your bright idea?
All I ever got was a flashlight.
The swamp's not drained yet.
I think I'll take it home and mount it.
I'm after only the top 1% of fish.
I told you not to use Beluga caviar...
Does this look fishy to you?
Should I mount this on the wall or on the ceiling?
I find it lures a much higher class of fish.
Just doing some light fishing?
The finer the bait, the shorter the wait.
Light tackle.
I hate cleaning the chandelier but I'm doing my wife a favor
It’s my chandelure.
I was hoping for a Lanternfish, but this is even better.
To be fair, I did ask for allure.
Six more chairs and I've got a complete dinette set.
Live bait can't compete with the chandelure!
I always try to catch a little something for the wife, too.
It takes longer to tie your own flies, but it’s worth it.
Are you using AC or DC line?
This is surprisingly heavy for a light thing.
Not what I had in mind when I wished for a catch to adorn the dinner table.
I really, really want to catch a lamprey.
So I told the guy “I can’t affor a reel that expensive. I’ve already spent a fortune on bait.”
I've heard of bioluminescence... but this is ridiculous!
That’s what I get for fishing in E. Bay.
You know, before global warming, this was midtown.
I tied it myself.
That's gotta be at least ten pounds.
Ya, I got a light.
My mother hated that thing when we moved in. She said she gave it to Goodwill.
Can you believe the stuff they dump off this Mar-a- Lago pier?
This will test the ‘you will not hang that in my house’ commandment
Yeah, I used a little 40 watt bulb to catch this baby.
When they said the waters were crystal clear they weren't kidding!
I had something else in mind when you said let’s fish and get lit.
"At first I thought it was an old tire, but I forgot we were fishing in the Hamptons.
You need to up your game if you're going to go fishing in the Hamptons.
Bait and switch!
"Nice catch, but I hear their tough to clean".
......so she says ‘Why don’t you catch some classy fish for once’ and I says ‘Classy fish? How am I suppose to catch classy fish’?
Must be from one of those fancy private schools.
There's no way I'm cleaning that.
I was hoping for MidCentury Modern.
I was hoping for something more contemporary.
Bummer. I was hoping for something easier to clean.
It’s a keeper. They’re LEDs.
Believe me, my lure will catch losers from The Apprentice and the White House.
Early 18th, you have to throw it back!
It's Renaissance Revival, you'll have to throw it back.
This will go great with the piano I caught yesterday
I have heard that gentrification is spreading into the East River
This is nothing... Last year I caught an harpsichord at the exact same spot.
And she said I was wasting my time.
"Wow...best I ever caught was a 60 watt sconce.
Fishing hasn't been the same since Sandy.
It gets them in the mood to eat.
Typical Saturday morning at Pier 1
I make my own lures during the winter. It was a very long winter.
It's as romantic as I know how to be. Ron, will you marry me?
A little misunderstanding at the bait shop. I asked them for a can o' beer.
Last week I caught a lamprey.
I've heard of a lanternfish but this is ridiculous.
It's a little heavy, but it's the only lure I use during heiress season.
I'm throwing it back. These things are a pain to clean.
I used an electric eel for bait.
Another underwater mortgage.
If I hook a mantel, we'll be finished renovating.
What the hell did you use for bait?
Ya know, no one ever talks about the upsides of climate change.
I don't think thats quite what they had in mind when they said fish were attracted to light.
I'm calling it the Chandelure.
Before global warming, there were some big houses on this beach.
Legend has it Liberace's boat sank in these waters.
What I really wanted was a Bud Light.
I'm hoping to catch a better class of fish.
I got it from Ivanka's Bait Shop over in Scarsdale...... Why?
It’s not Hoffa. It’s Liberace.
Throw it back! They're hell to clean.
Some of my lures are more elegant than functional.
You've finally convinced me that this gentrification is going overboard around here.
i was fishin' for something a little more mid-century modern.
I know it seems flashy, but it gets their attention.
That was easy...the real fight will be getting it on the train
I thought it was fishy when they described this water as "clear crystal," not "crystal clear."
Damn, I already caught my limit of Colonial Revival.
I guess I’ve got my mother’s day gift.
I shouldn't have used light tackle...
I'm going to throw it back. It's all about farmhouse chic these days.
That's nothing. Caught a baby grand piano last week.
No, my divorce was not what I'd call amicable.
They come for the food, but they will stay for the ambience.
I don’t use light tackle.
These invasive species are really getting out of hand.
Outstanding! I was hoping to catch something for a light meal this evening.
With any luck, Kate Winslet will be next.
Lesson One... It's all about getting their attention
So - I guess ocean levels are actually rising.
I was actually fishing for complements.
put it in the bucket with the electric eel and see what happens
That will go well with the dining room table you caught last week.
Well... it's not so much a lure as it is alluring.
I'm creating an ambiance
Don’t tell James Cameron we found it first, he’ll be pissed.
I know, I know, it may not work. Sometimes fish won't go for the live bait, but will they go for the glitter.
Ten candles or less you gotta throw it back.
It's not real crystal, throw it back!
The tough part is keeping the candles lit.
Trump University. Why? Where did YOU learn to fish?
I used a 20 watt flicker bulb on 25 lb. line.
I know it's not much of a lure, but it holds great sentimental attachment.
I thought you said this was a good spot for sconces?
It's a chande-lure.
First we set the mood, then we set the hook.
The guy at the bait shop said to use light tackle!
My wife would love this. Too bad it's catch and release.
Liberace once used this to catch a tuner fish.
Think this will look good once it is mounted?
That's the same one you threw back last month.
The guy at Liberace's Bait & Tackle swears this will work.
Lucky you-last week I got the toilet.
This species evolved from the Age of Enlightenment.
Damn auto correct! I meant bring BUD light, not BIG light!
All we need is an electric eel.
It's great for catching electric eels.
You said we were going night fishing.
Well What d'ya know! A Lamprey!
Lighten up. It might still work.
I think I'll mount it in the dining room.
I'm done with stink bait, this is kitsch bait.
They call it the chandelure.
Guess sea-level rise did get to Mar-a-Lago.
I figured we'd go fishing and catch a light meal.
I miss the days before light pollution.
I guess they weren't kidding about some rich place called "Manhattan" that used to be here before sea-level rise.
No wonder they're not biting....they're too busy dancing.
She'll still refuse to clean it!
Eh, I’ve seen bigger
They say it's best to use light tackle.
I guess you can add 'gentrification' to the list of problems facing marine life.
Yeah, well, they are out of season. I'll have to throw it back.
My day job? I approve expenditures for President Trump's federal agency appointees.
You want a light dinner?
You know, Jim, this tackle seemed considerably less ostentatious at the bait shop.
I was hoping for the grand piano.
We're trying to attract a certain kind of fish, Bob.
It’s expensive bait, but it’s the only way to land a trumpfish.
This one's OK. It's the candelabras we have to throw back.
Well, they ain't gonna believe this one either.
The hard part was getting it out of the house without waking your mother.
We could turn it on if we had an electric eel.
Liberace owned a beach down the shore before the hurricane.
Well, this sheds light on why the fish aren’t biting.
You can tell it’s a farm raised chandelier from the LED bulbs.
Oh this? Fish weren't biting with the old lures, thought I'd try something with a bit more razzle-dazzle.
The housing market in this area is underwater
It looks like a hassle to clean.
Maybe we should try Pier 2?
I hear they're a real pain to clean.
"All you had to do was dust it, Dad.|
This light pollution is really getting out of hand.
This used to be a great spot for fishing before it got gentrified.
Maybe it's because I gave her a power drill for Mother's Day?
She asked me to clean it. I figured, kill two birds with one stone.
Too splashy?
Wow, you're going to mount that aren't you?
I see he's tossed Obama's EPA legislation AND Oval Office decor.
Looks like the invasive carp species have made themselves pretty comfortable.
Bait your hook again. See if Liberace bites.
I've tried fishing with dynamite. Now, I'm fishing with elegance.
It's simple: If I use it as bait, she can't get it in the divorce.
That's what you get for using caviar as bait.
Are you serious?! ANOTHER chandelier!
These invasive species are really getting out of hand.
Well, this'll come in handy for night-fishing.
Ran outta worms and was mad at my wife. Sooo.....
Damn, I was hoping for a lava lamp.
How are we going to over-exaggerate this one?
I'm guessing it was dropped there to swim with the fixtures.
Who owns this dock? Some deposed potentate or the head of the EPA?
Look at the positive side. It'll still look good over the mantle and no taxidermist required.
This is a great spot. Last week I landed a typewriter.
I'm draining the swamp.
It's the East River. You have to use a lure they can see.
This way I don't have to dust it.
I'm not sure how it'll look on the wall, but it'll go great on the ceiling.
We had our prom here.
Nah, I stopped fishing here ever since they built Mar-a-Lago. Now I just troll for stuff.
So apparently we are at that exact point were the Great Pacific Garbage Patch meets the Titanic
Mar-a-Lago is weird.
The last time I used this baby, I caught the Phantom of the Opera...
It's surprisingly light.
I think you’ll have better luck on Craigslist.
It's a little small - I'd better let it go.
It's dowager season.
I see you switched to light tackle.
switched to light tackle, huh?
I've always used light tackle.
Only two tiered. Put 'er back.
Looks like the trout are redecorating.
I used this one here to catch my trophy wife.
Electric eels. They can't resist it.
I was hoping for a circular saw.
This is why I love fishing in Venice.
Fishing in the Hamptons ain’t what it used to be.
Before the ocean rose, they called this place Mir-a-Lago.
Cheryl thinks I'm overcompensating for a small rod.
This catch-and-release rule is getting depressing. Yesterday, it was Steinway concert grand.
I'm not surprised; after all, this is the Hampton's.
Ever think they've just been making fun of us the whole time?
Turns out, the bait shop is closed on Sundays. Great flea market across the street, though.
I know just where to mount it.
Okay. I guess I'll try some of your bait.
It's especially good for night fishing.
If it's like this all day, we're going to need a bigger boat
Well, I heard all the fish schools around here are private...
I've got the bait, but I need a switch.
Trout love it. It's from the Rainbow Room!
I thought the tension was kind of light.
Long ago, before the floods, there was an enchanted place called Mar a Lago.
It's surprisingly light.
What can I say - this was the roof of the penthouse before global warming.
Next time, let's steer clear of the Hamptons.
It must be off-season , I was hoping for a Tiffany
This one's getting released. I'm running out of places to hang them!
When you said "some light fishing"...
I thought we voted against developing the lake bottom.
It's gonna be a bitch to fillet.
Now if you'd just catch an electric eel, we can fish all night.
I’m going after a better class of fish
I guess the swamp's still draining.
I believe this spot was once called Mar-a-Lago.
Not another one. These are so hard to clean.
So that’s your bright idea for bait?
So much for a little light fishin'. '
Goldang it, Earl, another Louis-quatorze! At this rate we're never gonna land us a Louis-quinze.
I told my wife I’d clean the chandelier then go fishing.
I was told to use a light line.
I promised my wife I'd wash it this weekend.
I used an electric eel for bait.
I think the lumens are too low to keep it.
I guess it’s a nice lure Dave, if you’re fishing for compliments that is.
It's a pain fishing everything back out of the water each May, but the tax benefits are tremendous.
I use it when I run out of worms-it attracts a different class of fish.
Just doing a bit of light fishing
There just has to be a better way to clean a chandelier.
Not what I was hoping for, but at least my wife will love it.
This should go well with the sconces I caught last week.
Yeah. But they’re a bitch to clean.
I meant a Bud Light.
Looks like grandfather clocks just aren't biting today.
It made more sense in the store.
I use LED bulbs as bait and it works every time.
I'm thinking of having it mounted.
They're fixtures around these parts.
So is this your first time night fishing?
its four treble hooks and some swavorski crytals
What'd you use for bait, caviar?
Show-off.
Do you have a permit for that?
Welp, looks like I finally caught something worth mounting.
I would throw it back.
Ask them if they have any Grey Poupon.
You should've seen the helicopter I caught after 'Miss Saigon' closed.
Great. Now all I need is the table, the chairs, the silverware, the wine, and the FISH!!!
They didn't believe the six-foot bass, either.
First time I've used 60-watt filament.
The wife did want something light for dinner
Maybe you shouldn't have used glow worms for bait.
You should have seen the sconces that got away.
Just another shiner.
They say Trump Tower used to be here.
Throw it back. Maybe you'll get lucky and catch an LED.
Are you sure this is what the guy meant by 'light tackle'?
I thought it felt light!
I'm fishing for the 1%.
Too gaudy - I'm throwing it back.
Funny thing is, a month ago I caught a flashlight and threw it back because it was too small.
I love fishing off the Hamptons!
That new lure you got me for my birthday was guaranteed to catch the light, but, this isn't what I had in mind
I tie my own.
Ya gotta admit— the rising water level’s been great for fishing.
Huh, I guess Mar A Lago really is going under.
I read somewhere that they are attracted to light.
I found the Titanic!
When you said we were gonna do some “light fishing,” I thought you meant something else.
I never thought I'd feel under-dressed while fishing.
Did you hook that on light tackle?
With all these luxury houses underwater you never know what you'll snag
If it has fewer than six arms you have to throw it back.
Yeah, they may be hard to catch but those Liberace Fish are good eat'n.
I use it to catch electric eels.
Well, I'll be darned. They say lighting never strikes twice but this is my second chandelier today.
I wouldn’t wanna clean that one.
I used a glow worm to catch it.
I was hoping for something I could hang on the wall.
I thought you said you'd catch the biggest fish here, not the biggest fixture.
Those lightning bugs make great bait.
Beat that, son.
Should I mount this one?
This beats the flashlight I caught last year.
Looks like the fish are doing pretty good these days.
I'm trying a chande-lure.
If it's not pre-Victorian you have to throw it back.
I'm getting closer to Liberace's piano.
With this quality of lighting, they must have great schools down there.
We're gonna need a bigger bucket.
I'd throw it back in, they're a pain to clean.
I'm guessing that your wife would say "That's a keeper."
Nice. What did you use for bait?
And what do you expect to catch with that?
Global warming sure made fishing more interesting.
See, I told you my that electrician said they were biting today!
Now as soon as I lower the chandelier, you toss in the worm in a tuxedo.
Eh, I’ve seen bigger
It’s always such a shame to have to throw them back.
Divorce is a funny thing, the ex-wife got my tools.

It’s always the same when we fish above the ancient sunken city of Mar-a-Lago.
I use this to fish the Hamptons.
I must be using the wrong bait. That's the third one I've caught that's way too small for my dining room.
What kind of bait are you using?
It’s amazing what you can catch using light tackle.
It looks great but it's a real pain to clean.
I'll have to throw this one back. I'm still looking for a lava lamp.
Jesus! I thought they knew everything about the Titanic.....
Matching wall sconces will be the real challenge.
I guess I shouldn't have used that electric eel as bait
That’s got more mercury than a mackerel!
It's too light. Throw it back.
I've been trying to eat light lately.
Middle of the Atlantic, my ass. That James Cameron is full of shit.
It’s the new Trump lure! They say it’s going to make fishing great again!
so that's what you call, "light tackle"?
They say this used to be Liberace's old fishin' hole!
He must have been a big shot; they usually use cinder blocks to sink them.
Week after week; even changing lures, and I still can't catch one for the den.
Fishing has not been the same ever since the antique store took over the bait shop.
That caviar bait really works!

The wife's been angling for a new chandelier...
I think I've located the Titanic
First time I'll come home with something mom wants!
In my day, we just used worms.
These are really hard to clean.
There's gotta be an easier way to clean this thing.
Another Lamp, Rey?
I see you're trying your new chandelure!
I was told to use a light bait to catch more fish.
Can't afford to keep it - no LEDs.
Wow, your Liberace lure really delivers
This is the third time I've had to toss this back.
That will complete the dining room set
I've caught larger
It's amazing what you find when mortgages are under water.
Yeah, but it’s going to be hell to fillet.
Helps with night fishin'.
It's nice, but we just don't have the space.
It attracts the fish that live around Mar-a-Lago.
Lean back, I'm ready to cast.
An old timer told me I'd catch a lost more fish if I used light tackle.
It attracts the bottom feeders.
Maybe you should try a different bait.
This’ll look nice mounted above those sconces I caught.
The way I see it, I go home with something to either mount on my wall or ceiling.
I'm tired of trout, I'm going to try for an electric eel.
I think you're going to need a bigger dining room.
I’m going for the 1% that got away.
It catches loan sharks.
That should brighten up your day
It's a twelve light, two tier...you have to throw it back.
Puts pollution in a whole new light, doesn't it?
My wife's never going to believe this one.
Nothing anybody catches could hold a candle to this.
There is the legend of a fish known as Liberace.
Was Liberace buried at sea?

Their mortgage must have been underwater.
Maybe I can catch a lamprey with this thing.
The bait shop in Southampton sold it to me.

A real keeper. Think I'll mount it my dining room.
I want to see how a fish with good taste tastes.
They said to use a light bait...
This is to attract fish with more refined taste.
only 20 watts...gotta throw back.

I think I ruined the Under the Sea prom night again.
So much for fresh tuna Niçoise salad ... we’ll have to settle for Waldorf tonight.
Scoff all you want, the White House has been luring bottom feeders with an oval office desk lamp for over a year now.
Give a man a chandelier...
I'm telling you, Carl, catfish is a bottom feeder. They'll never go for something that fancy.
Shoot, I think it swallowed the hook.
Looks like we'll be having something light for dinner.
It's the rare Liberace fish.
Honestly, the trick is just keeping it lit
Told you, when you come out this early you catch the light.
I know it looks heavy, but it's pretty light.
Casting just takes practice, the real trick is keeping it lit.
Now I understand, when you said, let's do some light fishing off the dock.
I guess fish need a chandelier about as much as they need a bicycle.
It won’t put food on the table, but at least now I have something to put above it.
You're not catching anything with that, you need a sconce in these waters.

I could tell by its weight it wasn't a granite countertop.
Damn, I hate that catch-and-release rule.
Release?
It bobs pretty well, actually.
I'm trying a new fishing rig; it's called a chandalure.
Lights out, the best catch I've had all season.
I think I'll throw this one back, I just don't have time to clean it.
If you want to catch the Liberace-fish, this works great.
So the old stories about an abandoned Trump property are true!

Now if I caught an electric eel, I'd be in business.
The rich widows are really biting today.

Most people don't realize the Titanic sank this close to shore.
I was hoping for a lantern fish, but this will work well in the dining room.
Up for a light dinner, then?
It's large enough to keep. If it only has six candles, you have to throw it back.
Actually, I was hoping for a sturgeon.
I'm afraid that this is catch and release crystal.
It's not quite Mid-Century yet, so I think you have to release it back.
I told you winning the lottery wouldn’t change me.
It works great for night fishing, casting is an issue though.

As a matter of fact, I am fishing for compliments.

Last week I caught a Lantern Fish.
I'm not fishing. I'm helping Aquaman redecorate.
Huh. I had it baited for a desk lamp.

if only they had seen the iceberg
Wow. Charlie does have good taste.
Excuse me, do you have a light?
I know they're attracted to the light, but.. don't you think it's a bit much?
Ya’ know, thats not how you catch caviar.
I don’t get this bait and switch thing
Well, not Hoffa. But maybe Liberace.
If that isn't over the limit I don't know what is.
The tackle shop pulled a bait and light switch.
I was really pulling for a ceiling fan.
Four hours without a nibble. Time to go for Baroque.
I remember when life was simpler.
She said no fishing until the chandelier was cleaned
She’s a real beaut, Don, but you’ll have to throw it back. You know light fixtures are protected.

If it's not 100 lumens, you have to throw it back.
I think I just found the Titanic
So my wife said, either the chandelier goes or I go. It was a win-win.
It’s a Trump brand lure for swamp fishing; you have to stock the swamp for the best fishing. Make American Fishing Important Again. #MAFIA
For king crab it's all about the ambience.
I gotta throw it back - it would look hideous with our drapes.
I don't think that's going to be easy to clean.

Were you hoping for a lamprey?
Glad you like it- I'm fishing for compliments.
Got it at TrumpLures.com.
this is the only reason my wife lets me go fishing
I guess there must be some truth to the rumors about this being where the Titanic went down.

I find the fish enjoy a little extra ambiance.
Well, you could say it was Waterford. I’ll back you up.

They always fall for the bait-and-light-switch.
My grandfather taught me this method of catching electric eels.
Mermaid lure.
There's gonna be one very annoyed merman down there...
Gentrification is real, son.
Too bad it's a "catch-and-release" area.
You're only going to attract electric eels with that as bait.
Why just lure when you can allure?
Here's the bright side to dumping.
It's just a fluke.
I'll set the mood, you reel them in.
I guess Mar A Lago finally fell to the sea.
Been antiquing long?
Rats! Swarovski's are on the endangered list, I'll have to throw this one back.
So, what's the plan if it works?
Wow! Rich folks really don't believe in recycling.
If you want to catch the big fish, you have to use the right bait.
Dang. I was hoping to catch something I could mount on the wall.
As a lure, it's really better for night fishing.
Worked for my trophy Wife
It's the new Martha Stewart rod and reel.
NY gentrification has hit the docks!!
You really can't find crystal like this in stores anymore.
I've decided it must be too dark for the fish to see my bait.
Let's see my wife overcook this one.
You know, Hank, I think that fly-tying manual you bought online might have been a Russian hoax.
This is what happens when you fish where Miami Beach used to be.
Titanic catch, Jeff.
It's not big enough...you want it?
So much for "Drain the swamp"
These Titanic artifacts are getting really annoying.
I get all my home decor at Pier 1.
This one’s for city fish: they can’t resist the lure of the bright lights.
I hate this chandelier. Told the wife I was going fishing.
The book on pier-fishing said "use light tackle."
This is why I love fishing on Titanic Lake!

Damn! Another remodel over at the EPA offices
Electric eel. Why, what are you fishing for?
The Guy at the Bait shop promised that this lure would attract the classier fish.
Looks like we're having a light supper.
The hardest part was finding a tackle box to fit it
Are you going to mount it?
I'm starting to resent my fairy godmother.
Yeah, it's a good size one, but these are really a pain to clean.
I told you this neighborhood was gentrifying.
This particular lure is from the Victorian era.
I already have my limit of these
Too light. Better throw it back.
I'll have to throw it back. Eight light bulbs exceed the daily limit.
Can I borrow your bait? I promised my wife a new sink.
My wife got the lures in the divorce.
My wife said I have to help out around the house more. I told her I clean the chandelier.
Lately I've been fishing for things that are more sustainable
You'd think I could make light of this.
A step up from lamprey for sure.
I think I should have brought the Calder instead.
I guess they're having a ball.
So THAT'S what my wife did with the birthday gift I gave her last year.
Ambiance is just as important as choosing the right bait.
I thought you said this water was crystal clear?
I guess we’re over the Upper East Side.
I was hoping for the curio cabinet.
I told you there are all kinds of great catches at Pier One.
It's a Sicilian message. It means Liberace sleeps with the fishes.
Nice chandelure
Probably time for a different lure.
Well, I wanted a Tuna with good taste

The bait shop was closed.
I think of myself as Ernest Hemingway meets F. Scott Fitzgerald.
First time fishing for candle fish?
Nice catch, but I hear the're a bitch to clean+
So, yeah, I'm fishing for a mermaid. One with real class.
The Titanic?
And just this morning my wife said she preferred yard sales over going fishing.
Trolling for Trump?
I'm starting to see fishing in a whole new light.
Hoping to catch an electric eel?
There's got to be a better way to clean one of these.
The fish are so much more demanding these days.
My wife says the money has changed me, but I don't see it.
I used bait-and-switch.
It's bait and switch,
Liberace used to fish here.
I told you we'd have better luck if we left the Hudson.
The Baccarat are biting.
Just because it's alluring doesn't mean it's a lure.
Ahhh, the codfish ball must be here tonight.
Mama hated that thing. Now we know what she did with it.
This is when Catch and Release comes in handy.
This should make for a very illuminating fish story.
"I'm going for a Liberace".
They’re not that hard to catch, but they’re really tough to clean.
Wait’ll you see the fish.
This happens every time Antiques Roadshow comes through.
I only use it when I'm in the mood for some light fishing.
She's gonna be hard to clean
Whatever you catch with that, you can keep.
Now for the finishing touch on my underwater palace...
Let's see if this will attract a king salmon.
You're gonna need a bigger dining set.
Yea, I heard fish love bright lures.
Looks like our environmental remedies are working. Last year I could only catch old shoes and discarded tires.
The trick is to wine and dine them.
Well, it's a Monday afternoon, got off work early, thought I'd do a little light fishin'.
Too small, gonna throw it back.
When I ordered "light tackle" online I wasn't expecting this.
It helps attract fish from finishing schools.
Uh-oh. Some cabinet secretary's clearly trying to hide the evidence.
Definitely more cumbersome to cast, but the fish absolutely LOVE it.
At least the Mrs. will be happy!
Now all we need is a table, chairs, and some food.
Bait? I use foie gras.
I told you I felt a light tug!
I shouldn’t have thrown the candelabra back.
It's my new lure. If if worked for Liberace, why not for me?
Now we can fish after dusk.
I guess this is one of those bait and switch situations
Throw it back. I prefer something more modern.
I was hoping for something I could mount on the wall.
This is how you catch the one percent.
I told you not to bait with caviar.
I told you, with rising sea levels, fishing will only get better.
Looks like the fish are gentrifying.
If this doesn't impress them, nothing will.
I'm done with casual fishing...
The seas have risen.
Elegant, but the cement block had a nice simplicity
Amazon will deliver just about anywhere these days.
It's great for catching largemouth socialites
When I said: "I wish we'd brought more Lite," I was talkin' about the beer....
Fur Father’s Day, I told my youngin’s I wanted a fishin’ pole with a’lure.
Tiffany 38, I think that is a keeper
And they say antiquing is not a sport
The Tiffanies aren't running.
Catch something you fancy?
I told you, we’ve got to start fishing upstream from Mar-a-Lago.
This'll look great over the mantle.
In fishing for a middle aged mermaid with a rent controlled pre war apartment on the upper East side.
Fried in oil, anything tastes good.
Last week I caught a grand piano. It put up quite a fight.
First time I reached the daily limit on one cast.
Joey, I'm taking bait and switch to a whole new level
It's expensive, but Bait by Tiffany's is still the best.
"What are you hoping to catch down there, Liberace?
I just think it's more sporting to use light tackle
It was getting dusty.
Not even a nibble. I'm going back to night crawlers.
Throw it back, Earl. That's for illuminating the mysteries of the deep.
Trust me; I've seen that Disney movie a hundred times. Mermaids love this stuff.
I bought my lures at an Estate sale.
Looks like it is from the Titanic.
The guy at the sports shop said its good for catching mermaids, or trophy wives.
My wife said it needed cleaning and I just couldn’t resist.
Damn, looks like we've hooked into another underwater mortgage.
Say hello to my chande-lure
I guess I shouldn't have used a glow worm as bait.
That only works at night.
Perfect for a light lunch.
I saw somewhere that mermaids love shiny objects.
It's no wonder the state increased the hunting and fishing license fees.
My bait? A 10 carat zircon.
Sure, but your mortgage is still underwater.
It’s a good lure for a certain class of fish
It's how you catch a Liberace fish.
Oh yeah...We used to call this New Orleans!
I’m using a yellow 6ft extension cord leader with a 25 watt pulsating chartreuse “big shock” lure
Not exactly what I meant when I said to use a shiner
Too bad it's only catch and release here.
Not one bite. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
Well, my wife did say to catch something for dinner tonight.
No more glow worms for bait.
I was hoping for something in more of a Venetian neoclassical motif.
Well.... this just lit up my day!!
Well, you can put that Over the dining room table...
It was love at first light but then she got away.
I'm telling you, this is how you catch the big one
It’s to catch the lamp prey
I learned to distract them with shiny objects in DC. Since then I’ve taken it up a notch.
What kind of wattage are you using there for bait ?
I'm looking to attract a high class of fish.
Trying to land a mansion. Why do you ask?
On the other hand, it'll still look good in my trophy room.
Harry said he was underwater on his mortgage but I had no idea.
You're gonna need a bigger cooler.
Too bad it's catch & release. That'd look great above the bass

Well, you said we wanted to sell to more upscale restaurants.
Thank goodness it wasn't plugged in!
"I don't care how badly your wife would want it, Dave. The sign said 'catch and release only'.
I'm going for lampfish.
I'm trying to catch a rich widow
Well, it like we're having a light dinner tonight.
Only 12 arms. Gotta throw that little feller back.
You know how hard it is to clean these things?
I'm after lamprey.
I don't know what I'll catch with it, but I bet it'll be classy.
You'll have to toss it back; it's three lights short of legal.
Tell Dale to bring the good china for the fish fry.
This lure was on sale....I couldn't say no
Atlantis was much more formal then I envisioned
Wait... that's not the chandelier I put on my hook this morning.
Not another one.
I used a switch as bait.
Doing some light fishing today?
Catch is light today, eh?
De-cluttering can go too far.
Another one?
They're having a ball down there.
Nobody mentions the upside of pollution
I was fishing for compliments but this will have to do.
It got my worm.
Whaddya use for bait?
That puts fishing in a whole new light.
I gotta throw it back, my license is only for lamps.
Lat week, I caught a toaster oven.
They sent me this lure after I renewed my magazine subscription.
But for the seaweed I would say Baroque.
This gentrification's gone too far.
Well, Al, I’d never a thought that global warming would take Mar-a-Lago first”
After I clean the seaweed off, I'm going to tell my wife I got it for our anniversary.
How the heck do you clean that?
I was going for recessed, but they’re considerably more reclusive.
It was a beautiful renovation. Shame it put them underwater on the mortgage.
I can’t figure it. Rococo usually won’t bite minnows.
Unconventional, perhaps, but it’s great bait for catching electric eels...
I'll mount this one in the foyer.
Great! We'll have it at dinner tonight.
I hate these fancy lures.
I call this my 'chandelure.'
Chandelier? The clerk said it was a chandelure.
Throw it back, they are not LEDs!
Your mother said I can keep all of my fishing garbage in the divorce. I think I found a loophole.
She got the house.
It's definitely Louis IV.
I’m gonna need a bigger ballroom.
You need the right lure if you want caviar.
Forget market price, what's the going rate at Sotheby's?
Whatcha usin’, caviar?
I hear mermaids go for this kind of thing.
They'll be waltzing our way any minute now.
I once caught Liberace using this lure.
It's the garbage that washes downstream from Silicon Valley.
Mar a Lago in the year 2050.
At least it wasn't anther kitchen sink.
Quality lures.
Well the obvious question is...did Liberace have a yacht?
Think I'm going to switch back to worms.
If there's another fish in this sea, I haven't found her.
Hey, I've got a bright idea!
Wow. I thought Liberace Lake was just a name.
Next I’m going for the dining room set.
The man said this'll lure a better class of fish . . .
"Oh, that's right. D.C. is down there somewhere".
How the heck do I cast this?
I think the light was scaring the fish away.
You should see what we have hung over the dining table.
Ohhhh, so this is what they meant by trickle-down.
I knew that caviar would pay off eventually.
I'm trying to catch yuppies.
Laugh all you want. Last weekend, I caught six electric eels with this lure.
That bait works better on 5th Avenue.
I call this the 'Chande-lure'.
I can hang it in the den above the marlin.
This is why dad never took you fishing.
Now son, this is how we catch a Trump.
I heard there was a strong current at this point.
Well, looks like we are having a light lunch.
I prefer to illuminate, and release.
The worst day fishing is better than the best day redecorating.
Give a man a chandelier, he'll have light for a day. Teach a man to fish with a chandelier and ......
Nah, I used glow worms.
Oy, not another candelabra!
Liberace owned a beach house down the shore before the hurricane
These are ok--it's the sconces that are overfished.
I’ll bite: What kind of bait are you using?
So that’s where all those points of light went.
I blame it on climate change.
You go ahead and use your floor lamps. I just think crystal is more attractive in this light
...and when I pipe in some Mozart it really attracts the best caviar.
The trick is to add a bit of glitter to your lure.
Gad, 'Phantom' is hard to avoid.
I always buy my gear at Pier One.

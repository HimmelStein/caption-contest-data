Serves him right.
That's so meta.
You're right, death does become her.
They say he took his own life.
He died like he lived.
He's off to a better place.
He's so unlifelike.
What's next. No taxes?
Does this mean we'll be married forever?
Does this mean I can start smoking again?
Better him than us.
He was so full of life.
I guess that leaves taxes.
I've never seen him looking so grim.
Don't get too close... it could be a trap.
He makes it look so easy.
He won't be missed.
It should've been taxes.
He had it coming.
'Guess we should have saved more for retirement.'
That seems redundant.
Who said irony is dead?
Do you think it was suicide?
How the tables are turned!
O death, where is thy sting?
They made him look so grim.
Oh, how the tables have turned!
Apparently, he worked himself to death.
He always was sickely
I told him he was working himself to death.
Poor guy worked himself to death.
Who’s going to take over the family business?
They said it was a suicide.
He is faking it!
You're not fooling anyone.
He met his match.
Irony is dead
Well, he certainly had it coming.
He was such a good guy
And I thought he'd bury us all...
Well, it's about time!
I heard it was suicide.
Well this is grim.
He looks like hell.
What!!? You thought would be the 'lucky' one?
‘Well, I guess you really do reap what you sow’
He went down swinging.
Ya reap what ya sow.
Live by the scythe, die by the scythe.
He sowed what he reaped.
He looked in a mirror.
You never think it is going to happen to you.
Karma's a bitch, ain't it?
FAKE DEATH!
Isn't that redundant.....
If only he'd had a gun...
Death really becomes him
fgsh
Let the dead bury the dead
It was the salmon mousse.
I always thought we would go first
It was him or us.
I heard it was self-inflicted.
I heard he worked himself to death.
He looks like he did when he was dead.
Not so grim...
I told him not to run with a scythe.
They say he never saw it coming.
He looks so natural.
About time....
They're calling it a suicide.
He was waiting for Godot.
First taxes, now him.
Poetic justice.
You reap what you reap.
He's never looked less grim.
Lying down on the job!
The Grim Sleeper
Now all we have left is taxes.
For the life of me I do not recognize the deceased
I guess you reap what you reap!
He loved irony.
I bet he never saw it coming.
I never thought he'd be the first to go.
Now if we could just do something about taxes.
He finally met his match!
Well, you reap what you sow.
He looks like death warmed over.
I guess the only thing we can count on now is taxes.
Well, at least irony isn't dead.
Well, dead is dead.
Oh well, what goes around comes around.
Does this mean we're stuck together...forever?
I told him not to look in the mirror.
It was his time, again.
Who knew
You sow what you reap.
We always thought he'd be the last to go.
I guess you reap what you sow.
That's karma for you.
I always thought he would be the last to go.
He's in a better place.
He took his own life.
Well, you reap what you reap.
"He always had a death wish".
I guess you really do reap what you sow...
I guess he reaped what he sowed
I always thought I'd go before he did.
I guess it's true - you reap what you sow
He lived a grim life.
It's about time!
Does this mean we're stuck here?
Does this mean we're off the hook?
Done.
He reaped what he reaped.
I always thought we’d go first.
Finally got a taste of his own medicine.
He looks just like himself.
I thought he was just on a holiday.
This is so meta.
I guess the job got to him.
He should have see it coming.
Well, I guess that just leaves taxes.
Death at a funeral.
Evidently Phil's act didn't fool everyone.
Does this mean we don’t have to pay our taxes
So, now it's just taxes.
Did he name a successor?
Well, he certainly reaped what he sewed!
You never think it'll happen to you.
Karma finally got him.
Looks like death warmed over to me.
He died like he lived—dead.
Karma.
Could taxes be next?
Finally.
I heard it was sickle cell
The irony is killing me.
He's dead tired.
Whatever you do, don't sign the guest book.
What
I thought you would go first.
Now the only thing certain is taxes.
I told him not to mess with Chuck Norris.
Well, this leaves only taxes.
So... this is life after Death?
I thought he was already dead !
I was sure he’d outlast taxes.
He lived a full death...
I was really hoping Taxes would go first...
He dug his own grave.
Does this mean we have to live forever?
He looks like life warmed over.
It was suicide.
She always dressed for the occasion.
Fake news.
They ruled it a suicide.
All that's left now is taxes.
He would have wanted it this way
Never thought I’d live to see the day!
I heard he killed himself.
I didn't even know he was sickle.
He loved that outfit.
At least he didn’t suffer.
Now all we have to worry about are taxes.
He reaped what he sowed.
You live by the scythe, you die by the scythe.
It was the job that killed him.
Did they have to make him look so grim?
So lifelike.
As you sow, so shall you reap
Must have been suicide
But he was so young!
If this means what I think, can we talk about diverse?
He died as he lived.
Life just won't be the same without him.
Touché!
You can take it with you.
I always thought we'd go before him.
At least he died doing what he loved.
Death becomes her.

Well, at least taxes are still certain.
They did a terrible job- he looks like Death warmed over!
He should have seen this coming
I'm not surprised. He looked like death.
I guess what goes around, comes around.
He looks so alive.
He died of irony.
Hoisted by his own petard.
What comes around,goes around.
This is a game changer.
He looks so . . . unnatural
He looks so dead.
Now we can finally rest in peace.
We won.
He hung on like grim death.
At least we can still count on taxes. . .
Looks like the next international crisis will be overpopulation.
Does this mean we have to stay married forever?
Worst flu season ever.
Do you think he saw it coming?
It was just a matter of time.
He died doing what he loved. Death.
He looks like himself
As you reap, so shall you go.
What goes around comes around.
Well now what?
I hear he took his own life.
He doesn't look so grim now.
It was sickle cell.
They say it was suicide
He always said his work would be the death of him.
Bet he never saw That coming.
He worked himself to death.
He’s never looked so good.
They say his job killed him.
He looks so grim
Now there's just taxes
Looks warmed over.
He's keeping it cold for me.
He was always so full of life
I guess that just leaves Taxes.
Wow, he looks like death warmed over.
Ironic.
It's amazing how Death-like he looks.
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
Now what?
Does this mean we get to live forever?
Yeah, but we still have taxes.
So much for "'Til death do us part"
He finally reaped what he sowed.
I told him his job would kill him.
Karma's a bitch.
I sure hope Taxes are next.
His job finally got to him.
His job finally caught up with him!
He looks so life-like.
Does this mean we're immortal?
At least he died doing something he loved.
I wonder who came for him.
So who came for HIM?
He still looks so grim.
At least we still have taxes
He had so much death left in him.
This feels like a trap.
Death takes a holiday.
It becomes him.
He looks so death-like.
May he rest in pieces.
He was a victim of his own success
That’ so grim!
He took the early retirement package.
Rest in Peace
Does this mean we're going to live forever?
Does this mean I'm stuck with you forever?
It’s grim alright.
I knew his job would kill him
Doesn't he look like himself?
Whoa. Meta.
I told him not to mess with me.
He looks good.
Didn't see that coming.
who reaped the reaper
He looks almost lifelike.
It was him or us, dear.
I guess it's just taxes now.
Busman's holiday.
#timesup
He looks pretty grim.
Well, that leaves taxes.
He always said the job was killing him.
He touched so many lives.
He brought it on himself.
now what are we supposed to do?
Do we still pay taxes?
He never saw himself coming.
I wonder what this means for the rest of us.
What's next...taxes?
As they say, you reap what you sow.
He looks a bit grim don't you think?
So I wonder who came for him?
I guess now it’s just taxes.
He always had a dark sense of humor.
I never liked him.
That just leaves taxes.
It was inevitable.
Suicide?
He touched a lot of people.
He touched so many
I guess the only thing certain now are Taxes!
He died of supernatural causes.
He looks so peaceful.
He really worked himself to death.
Payback's a bitch.
Well, he reaped what he sowed.
So this is what it feels like
I bet he didn't see it coming.
Death really does become him.
'He doesn't look so grim.'
He was always larger than life.
I told him not to touch himself.
Life finally caught up with him.
He was his own worst enemy.
Seems redundant.
There goes our retirement plans.
Looks like he finally reaped what he sowed
You know what they say about Karma.
They say it was self-inflicted.
I wonder what he sowed
Death be not proud!
He never saw it coming.
It's true. You reap what you sow.
Well, we still have taxes.
I guess he saw it coming.
Who says you can't take it with you!
It's a trap!
He had so much to live for
The irony of death
I
We told him it was a dead end job.
I want a divorce.
He died doing what he loved.
He looked good for his age.
He died the way he lived.
Meta.
Does this mean I'm stuck with you for eternity?
He lived a good death.
You should see the other guy...
I told him that job would be the death of him.
He was so full of death.
Well, at least he died doing what he loved
You reap what you sow.

Life won’t be the same without him
This can't be good for business?!
I guess his work finally caught up with him.
He looks like death!
Ok, now I feel old.
One scythe fits all.
I always thought he would bury us all.
Well so much for 'to death do us part'
Well that's ironic
It was either him or me.
Ironic, isn't it?
He looks so supernatural.
He's never looked better.
Gosh, you really do reap what you sow.
So are taxes next?
May he REAP in peace.
He brought this upon himself.
Looks like he reaped what he sowed
Reap no more!
He finally caught up with himself...
Call the Russians. Get our suite booked at the new ISS hotel.
Oh, he looks so deathlike!
Well, I guess he reaped what he sewed.
What will do us part now?
Now, nothing's certain but taxes.
He had a good run.
Does this mean we'll live forever?
He looks a little grim.
Well, that just leaves taxes.

Who's going to take care of us now?

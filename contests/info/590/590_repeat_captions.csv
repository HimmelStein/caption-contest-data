When he's extinct, they'll be worth a fortune.
Revisionist history
YOU tell him not to write on the walls.
I don't get modern art.
That's a Picassosaurus.
His art is very primitive.
It's so derivative.
All that without opposable thumbs.
Let's kill him.
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.
Looks like we're on the menu.
My kid could paint that.
Outsaurus.
I could do that
BANKSYSAURUS
Do you think he made me look fat?
It's cheaper than wallpaper.
Just think what it will be worth after he's extinct!
That's so, yesterday!
Grocery list
I don't know art but I know what I like.
He's ahead of his time.
He must be a sketchasaurus
Banksy?
Let's kill him and claim we did them.
My five-year old could do that.
It’s Banksy!
Fake news.
I thought we agreed on wall paper.
I told him not to draw on the walls!
OMG... more Fake News!
“Let’s put some pretty little horses...” “Look out Fred. It’s a Bobrossasaus
I hate modern art.
Hold up, I want to see how the story ends!!
I don't undestand Modern Art.
I don't think much of his color palate.
Uh oh, I think that's his grocery list.
Derivative.
I thought Grafitisaurus' were extinct?
Am I really that fat?
He really needs a girlfriend.
He comes from along line of Dinodrawus
All she ever thinks about is food.
I hope that's not his grocery list.
I told you he wasn't a herbivore
It's a Banskysaurus.
I hate editors.
It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.
It’s a graffitisaurus!
There goes the neighborhood...
My kid could do better than that.
They won't last.
I liked his Jurassic period better.
Let's kill him and take credit for his work.
It doesn't look a think like me
He's in his Jurassic period.
It'll be worth more when he's dead.
Don't worry. We'll get credit for it.
His earlier work is much more primitive.
It's meta.
Don't worry, the wall adds 10 pounds.
We'll probably get blamed for this.
How derivative!
He’s my ghost writer
I didn't know he could stand on two legs!
Mystery solved.
They say he's ahead of his time.
Grab our bones and stones, I'll off this dude and we'll make history here.
We’re going to get blamed for this.
I found him on Angie's List.
I prefer his earlier work.
Why
Who knew?
Early plagiarism.
My kid could do that.
He's way ahead of his time.
Everyone thinks they're an artist these days.
Don't worry. We'll get the credit.
You call THAT art?
I told you evolution is just a theory.
We're losing control of the narrative.
Show off!
Why didn’t we think of that.
I can't believe she left you for an artist.
So primitive.
But is it art?
Yes, but is it art?
And they save we are primative
You know who's gonna get blamed for this
We better nip this in the bud.
We’re gonna get blamed for this.
I like his early work better.
He calls himself "Banksy."
It's fake news.
The wife insisted we get an interior designer.
He calls them Emojis.
Let's eat it.
I think he is trying to tell us something.
So that's how they got there.
Plagiarus Rex
It's a Sketchasaurus.
I think it's a menu.
There goes our deposit.
So that's what Banksy looks like!
Picassosaurus.
I bet we get blamed for this.
First the lizartists move in, then the rents go up.
You know we're going to get blamed for this...
Am I that fat?
History is written by the victor.

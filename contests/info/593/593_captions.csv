It's not so much what she said as how she said it.
No, my wife served the papers personally.
I'm pretty sure it's a final notice
...oh, and there's a note from your mother.
‘Sharply worded’ would describe it.
Actually, I would like to shoot the messenger.
Hi honey, we just received the new Republican tax plan.
Well, it doesn't feel like a metaphor.
Yes, I am painfully aware of your terms and conditions.
What I had actually said was "Take a stab at it and get back to me"
I have reason to believe that my wife found our love letters.
At least she didn’t use bullet points.
And I said, "Divorce papers? Why not just stick a knife in my back?"
To her credit, she did leave a note.
I'd like to switch to paperless statements.
Turns out they CAN pin it on me
The stress is bearable, it's the paperwork that's killing me.
I think we can rule out reconciliation.
I've just received some painful news.
I'm sorry, but Emma and I won't be able to make it to your murder mystery party. Clever invitation, by the way.
She knows.
My wife served the papers herself.
No, I can't sit back and relax.
I got your text but I’m having trouble with the attachment.
I wouldn't say it went well, but she did sign the divorce papers.
Remember when we thought there couldn't be anything worse than his tweets.
All I can say is that I did not see this coming.
No, I haven't read it but I get the point.
I think the worst news is behind me.
I can’t read it, but I got the message.
No, I haven't read it yet, but I get the point.
Yes, well I'm afraid I'm not in any position to read the fine print just now.
........ all I said was "You know where you can stick it."
Turns out the pen and sword are about equal.
I need to order some Post-It Notes for my wife.
I was under the impression that the writing would be on the wall.
You were right. She didn't like the pre-nup.
So she said, ‘How can I convince you that I am filing for divorce?’. And I said, ‘Take a stab at it.’
'Yes doctor, you could call it a stabbing pain."
Your last letter really hurt.
The good news is she finally signed the divorce papers.
No, it's not the handwriting that makes it difficult to read.
What are you going as? I'm the Wittenberg Church door.
I don't see why you can't leave notes on the fridge like everyone else
I think we’re past mediation.
Please remove me from your mailing list.
No, I mean literally.
Man, these back taxes are killing me.
Can't talk right now, I'm stuck with some paperwork
The prenup is signed. How quickly can you draw up a will?
i'd like to switch to paperless billing please.
I can't read it. But I feel it's bad news.
She got the house, and I got stuck with the mortgage.
I'd like to switch to your paperless billing option.
It's an advance copy of the new Republican tax plan.
No, I wouldn’t say the prenuptial discussion went well.
I received some painful news.
Yes, I’m pretty certain she just served me with divorce papers.
Why can’t you just text, like everyone else?
So you filed for divorce behind my back?
What really hurts is that you couldn't tell me to my face.
I'd like to sign up for paperless billing...
Yes, without a word. But she did leave a painful note.
Yes, I'm sure the differences are irreconcilable...
We need post it notes.
Yes, I do think she really means it this time.
Hello, 911? Hi, it's the middle class. I just received the House tax plan.
I'd like to switch to online billing.
Hello, I'd like to switch to paperless billing.
Why yes, she did leave a note...
Her divorce attorney is a Lutheran, I think.
I'd like to start receiving my bill online.
If I had to guess, I'd say that the divorce is contested.
I can't read it, but I gather you're unhappy.
Sorry, I can’t make it, I have a to-do list that is killing me.
She wants either a divorce or Protestant reformation.
She left me a very pointed note.
Can I switch to paperless delivery?
Mediation is probably out of the question.
I got my performance review today.
Tell the orthopedist the pain is back and I haven't seen the bill.
So then I said, "Who leaves a homicide note?"
Listen, it's not what you said, it's how you said it.
I'd like to report an attack ad.
Yes, I heard from her attorney.
Signed, no. Executed, yes.
I'd like to cancel our marriage counselling appointment.
I need to get something off my back.
She left a 'Dear John' letter. It really hurt.
It's not the fine print that I'm worried about.
I think she's serious this time.
Agnes, I got your divorce papers today and I must admit they hurt me more than I expected.
It's not the demands I object to, it's the way they were presented.
I believe my wife chose to serve me the papers herself.
yes, she left a note.
It certainly doesn't feel like fake news . . .
Yes, can you tell me how to unsubscribe?
Yes, I think the divorce papers are still where you put them.
Of course she signed the pre-nup, I have it right here ...
I don't know what it says. That's why I need you to come over.
No, I'm quite sure I selected email notifications.
I have a hunch my wife found out about us.
I'm going to need a paramedic and a divorce attorney
Honey, it's backwards in the mirror. Can you just come home and read it?
She left a note. No, I haven't read it yet.
What part of "literally" don't you understand?
Next time just send me a text.
I haven't read it yet, but I'm pretty sure she wants a divorce.
It feels more like a utility knife than a steak knife, but I could be wrong.
It's a sharp pain in my back. I have a nagging feeling that there's more to it.
Oh, so now I'm the one who's being dramatic?
You said the instructions are on the back?
Yes, she signed the papers.
Of course I'm sure - she left a note
It started it with a ‘kick me’ and it went downhill from there.
I'm detecting a new level of animosity in the negotiations.
You couldn’ta just texted me ??
The worst part is she moved out and stuck me with the lease.
Mrs. Luther, your son Martin must learn to hand in his homework like everyone else.
Didn’t read your note but got the point
Hello Mr. Trump. My name is Willard Skivington from the middle class. I wanted to inform you I just now received a copy of your new tax plan.
Let's just say she made her point.
Can't play golf today. Jenny is kind of anxious that I finish my to-do list.
I'm not sure what it says, but somehow I get the point.
The New Yorker asked me to stop submitting cartoon captions.
I don't know--a list of grievances, I think. She seemed angry.
In life, Joe, there are to-do lists and or-else lists.
No, I don't see any note.
I've got a bad back, but there's a funny story attached...
What to-do list was that, Hon?
She got the house. I got the cutlery.
No, negotiations did not go well.
Can you come over? I need you to read something.
Yes Officer Dibble, my wife has read the restraining order.
I think my wife found out about us.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she wants a divorce.
911? I'd like to report an ultimatum.
It’s not what you said, it was how you said it!
No, mother, this time I don't think she's coming back.
I liked it better when she left notes on the refrigerator.
Sorry I can't come, I've been stuck with the to-do list.
No. Technically I haven't seen the summons.
No, I'm not with the White House any longer.
No -- no, I think it's too high to be sciatica. Feels more like a manifesto.
The knife wound is minimal, but the words cut deep.
That's right. She delivered the divorce papers personally.
I wish he would go back to tweeting.
It's not a metaphor, Operator.
Sorry, I don’t have the exact figures in front of me.
I’d like to report a backstabbing. No eyewitnesses but they did leave a note.
It might be a toss up as to which one is mightier.
Sorry I can’t, I just got stuck with some paperwork.
I wouldn't call it a death threat as much as a manifesto.
Does this mean it’s over?
Well that's all fine and good, Lorraine, but the note is backwards in the mirror, so how 'bout you just tell me what it said?
It’s not so much what it says as how it was presented
Sorry, no golf today. Trudy just reminded me it's her birthday
Apparently, they want the contract signed in blood.
Your lawyer sent the divorce papers.
Yes Jim, the divorce papers were served personally.
Tell Mr. Mueller I'm ready to talk.
I forget: Where did you leave my copy of our child-support agreement?
No, I'm pretty sure it will be contested.
She isn’t totally on-board with the divorce settlement.
In this case, it's not what it says that hurts, but how they said it.
Fake news. Real knife.
I’d like to switch to paperless billing.
Well, she signed the prenup. But she wasn’t happy.
I'd prefer paperless billing in the future.
No, doctor, it's more like a stabbing pain.
It wasn't just the email. She also added an attachment.
and then I said, " President Trump,you can't keep tweeting! There must be another way of communicating with the media"
I'd love to stop by, but my paperwork is killing me...
I'd like to complain about your overly aggressive process servers.
That's the last time I date a Protestant.
The good news is, she signed the papers.
About 5'10", chubby; possibly Lutheran.
Oh she's more than just talking behind my back.
This is what I get for marrying a Lutheran.
I'll stop calling if you stop writing.
Yes dear, I got your note.
Now she's spreading vicious rumors behind my back.
I don't think it's "Uncontested" anymore.
Yes Greta, I got the divorce papers.
I'm calling to report a hate message.
There may be some lingering resentment.
Et tu, Verizon?
When I said don't shoot the messenger, wouldn't you think no stabbing is implied?
Well...it still hurts, but at least I've put it behind me now.
Not sure what it says but she really seemed to take the “back-stabbing bitch” comment quite literally
She's delivered the divorce papers.
I've been served.
Yes doctor, its a stabbing pain between my shoulders... yes, I did just sign a new contract with my cable company.
Yeah, I got the message.
Yes, dear, I got your message.
I’d like to unsubscribe from your mailing list.
Yes,I'm a 100% sure she found the letter I wrote to you.
Does this mean it’s over?
I looked everywhere.
Yes, I'd like to report an overreaction.
At least she had the decency to leave a note.
There is a will, but I don’t think you could call it uncontested
The fine print is killing me.
Well, she decided not to sign the prenup.
Yes, I have a copy, and it’s binding.
I think the pre-nup touched a nerve
She left instructions for my next wife.
She finally stuck me with divorce papers.
I know, but this time I think she means it.
No. I wouldn’t use the word amicable.
Yes, I do mean literally.
Hey, Brutus it's me... I got your note.
This hurts, Judy.
How can I change the delivery method for future notices?
911? I need an ambulance and a proof reader, stat.
Well, she delivered the divorce papers.
Yes, I got the final notice.
I think she wants a divorce.
No. Literally, this time.
On second thought, I do agree to the terms and conditions.
She overreacted ‘cause the job jar and fridge magnets were full.
My client has expressed reluctance at accepting your proposal.
The acupuncturist stopped by with another payment notice.
*Can you hold? I think I have another message.
The good news is, they gave me a very detailed severance package.
She served the papers herself.
Yes, hi. I'd like to change my delivery preferences.
Got your message. Point taken.
She’s hired a real backstabber for a lawyer.
Remember the new neighbor I said looked like Martin Luther?
You could've sent me an all caps text message.
And then I asked her to sign a prenup
Yeah, it's definitely worse than those itches you can't quite reach.
OK, I’m ready to switch to paperless billing now.
I think she means it, this time.
Hello...menopause hotline?
They got back to me in writing.
I looked everywhere.
My backstabbing wife has just served divorce papers on me.
Trust me, I don't have to read it to know it's not good news.
My annual performance review didn't go too well.
Yes I heard. Republicans sent the middle class a message. Yes I got mine too.
The next time the alimony check is late, just call me.
So, then marriage counseling is out?
The wedding's off. She refused to sign the pre-nup.
Well, it feels like about four or five pages, but I think you're missing my main concern.
I sense three or four pages. Does it matter?
Yeah, she served me the papers herself.
I wouldn’t call it an amicable divorce.
No, I cannot forward the Message
They told me it's a binding contract and I'm stuck with it.
She said something about never listening.
It pains me to read your letter.
I didn't get a good look at him, but I'm pretty sure he's Lutheran
I want to report an attempted contract killing.
Yes, sweetheart, of course I am sure that I no longer work at the White House. the President told me in person!
I won't be coming to work today. My To-Do list is killing me.
Yes, I can show that I was personally served.
Funny that you mention it. She did seem a bit upset.
I believe I'm the target of a hate mail campaign.
I just got her counter-proposal. What's our next move?
Yes I have the note. Yes I know where the note is. Yes it is in a place where it won't get lost. No I cannot read it to you.
Mother, of course she was decent enough to leave me a farewell note.
I'd prefer to go paperless from now on.
It’s safe to say she’s not bluffing this time.
It hurts to admit it, but I feel you've made your point.
Room Service? Could you, please, send up two mirrors.
These bills are killing me.
I thought reporting to HR was confidential?
I brought a subpoena to a knife fight.
She said I don't pay attention to the Post Its.
... and then she stuck me with a long list of demands.
Martin, I think more people would see it if you pinned your message to a church door.
Hello Mabel, my wife found your letters.
Well, she didn't embrace constructive criticism as much as I'd hoped
The sign said “Post No Bills” not “Post On Bill...”
Well, they missed my spinal cord so I wouldn't call it 'crippling debt.'
I sense it's over.
Yes, I received the divorce papers.
No, it’s a sharp stabbing pain.
Yes, as chance would have it, I do have a living will posted where first responders can find it.
I think it's the divorce papers, and I'm guessing she signed them.
Yeah, I'm sure. This time, the divorce is going to stick.
Yes, literally
Yes, I'm sure the message was meant for me.
Apparently they call it targeted advertising.
No dear, I did not see your note.
The new Congressional tax plan has just arrived.
Haven't read it yet, but I am guessing it's not good news.
Yes, I received the divorce papers.
I miss the old days when they just wrote 'Kick Me' on sticky notes.
There's a backstory you should know about.
Yes, I'd like to lodge a complaint concerning your delivery service.
An amicable separation appears to be off the table now.
Yes, unfortunately, they found a way to make the charges stick.
Your letter was really hurtful
Can I talk to someone about going paperless?
Got your message. Point taken.
Yes, Martha, I got the divorce papers.
I think I got her answer to the prenup.
I see. And, what if I'm 90 days late?
Yes, the divorce papers just got here. No, I don't think she's kidding.
Yes, I've heard the expression "Stick it to the man."
This wasn't what I meant when I said let's put our grivances behind us.
Please remove this list from me, I mean me from this list.
Please put me on your Do Not Stab list.
I didn't see it coming. She served me the divorce papers herself.
Your mother stopped by and left a note.
Yes, I’ve received it Senator. Now I understand why it’s called a middle class tax cut.
Can I change to the digital subscription?
I think my wife is on to us.
I haven't seen their comments but I sense they’re unhappy with a few of the terms.
You were right, I should have known Martin Luther would be a bad roommate.
Remember you told me the prenup was bulletproof?
Yes. I got your note. You made your point.
Hello, IKEA customer service? My wife finds your assembly instructions confusing and frustrating.
She didn't go for the pre-nup.
Stabbed in the Back With a Note Attached Hot Line? I'm calling about...yes, I'll hold.
No, I didn't see it coming. Yes, she did leave a note.
I think we're done with counter-offers.
I don't think you understand what I mean by "paper cut."
I’d like to change my billing preference to “online.”
She delivered the subpoena herself.
Well, there is one sticking point.
She delivered it herself. I haven't been able to get to it yet.
I called him a back-stabbing, ignorant list-maker, and look where it got me.
Honey, do you remember where you put the shopping list?
Indications are pointing towards a painful divorce.
I assume a friendly divorce is out of the question.
She finally served the divorce papers.
I had a different understanding when you said you have my back in this contract.
I received your letter, but I'm sensing some hostility.
I just heard from her lawyer,it's going to get ugly.
Hello 911, someone has just stabbed me and left a note to make it look like a suicide.
Please inform Mr Luther that the church is actually next door.
Well, to be fair I did ask him to take a stab at the report.
Mr. Fleceum Esq. please. My wife just served me divorce papers and I think it's going to be messy.
No, if she were mad she would tell me.
You were right, she served the papers herself.
I think it's safe to assume she's made up her mind.
The good news is that she signed the separation agreement.
For the last time, Mr. Luther, my name is Chuck Dorr, not Church Door.
No, I already looked on the refrigerator.
I got your message, and I'm hurt.
I would like to report a threatening letter that I have just received.
Honey, you said I couldn't find it if it was pinned to my chest. Well? Where is it?
I can no longer refer to the divorce proceedings as " amicable."
Actually, I’m not able to read the fine print.
Dad, remember when you said words could never hurt me?
I’m guess I’m looking for a divorce lawyer.
I don't think the prenup is going to fly
I suppose this means the divorce is no longer an amicable parting of two people that still care very much about one another?
I didn't read it but I feel I got the point.
Not to jump to conclusions, but I'd say my attacker is likely a Lutheran.
Short, German accent, answers to Luther.
She just stuck me with divorce papers.
It started out as a friendly game of pin the tail on the donkey.
I’m not being paranoid. They stabbed me in the back with the terms of that contract.
Yup, pretty sure she's filing for divorce...
Yes, I recieved your apology, but it feels insincere.
Yes. Phyllis really nailed me with those divorce papers.
I'm pretty sure she wants a divorce.
Please resend it, I can't read the attachment.
No, Mildred; I haven't read the letter yet...but I get the message.
Yeah, she left. I haven't read her note, but it hurts already.
Yes, Dear...your mother did leave a message.
It's back from peer review.
Yes, dear. I did get your message.
Yes, I did receive the divorce papers today.
Yes, I did hear from your lawyer.
The ex got just about everything... Although she did leave me the title to the Prius.
They’ve presented a fairly compelling counter offer.
She's fairly adamant about the divorce settlement.
Well, bravo, Janice. This time you've also robbed me of my favorite metaphor to describe how this divorce feels.
Hold on. I think someone is trying to get my attention.
911? Yes, please send an ambulance and a divorce attorney right away.
She says she wants out, and this time I think she's serious.
We are out of post-its again.
No, it's more like a deeply personal kind of pain.
No, I have to say the discussion about the pre-nup didn't go well.
My ex just violated the restraining order.
I can't read the fine print, but I think she's serious this time.
My fiancé has a few issues with the pre-nup draft.
Apparently she and I have different understandings of ‘amicable.’
I'm starting to think that the couple's therapy isn't working..
I don't know what it says, but I have a feeling it's some sort of grievance.
Hang on, I believe Col. Mustard left a message
All I said was just give me the shopping list.
Yes, it came on very suddenly; I'd say it starts at the shoulder blades and kind of radiates out.
Call it a hunch, but no, I don't think my wife will be open to marriage counseling."
Hi mother, my divorce papers just arrived.
I'd appreciate being put on your Do Not Stab list.
Honey, Your lawyer was here.
Yes, I got your demands, but posting them on my door would have been OK too.
I had no idea they put out a contract on me.
I'd like to go paperless, please.
I need to get a few legal issues off my back.
Well, it wasn't the NRA...
It wasn’t her lawyer. She delivered the divorce papers herself.
I guess the divorce papers are final.
Yes, it's over, she served the papers herself.
Yeah, she signed it, but she wasn't happy.
Yes, she signed and returned the prenup.
Hi, I'm holding for Brutus. Is he in?
Actually, Mr. Trump, when you said, "I've got your back covered" this wasn't exactly what I expected.
Martha, can we go back to the regular Post-it notes?
I need both and ambulance and an ambulance chaser, please.
I'm pretty sure the divorce paperwork is final.
Yes, I definitely got the subpoena. Oh yeah, it was served on my person alright.
Believe me, they're not willing to negotiate.
What divorce papers?!
Hi, I'm just calling to let you know I got your manuscript and I literally can't put it down.
Yes, she's gone. Yes, left me a note. Yes, she was very upset. No, I haven't read it yet. Yes, I love you. Will talk later.
A simple 'No' would have sufficed.
I'm so sorry, I won't be able to make it in today. I have a stabbing pain in my back
...yes, then I said, stick it wherever you think it will do the most good.
This time I think she's serious.
No mom, this time I think she means it.
I have a complaint about the tags on your shirts.
Sorry Bob, no poker tonight. The wife stuck me with some errands.
As divorces go, it's been pretty amicable.
So I said to her "I'll tell you where you can stick your Dear John letter"
Phyllis, your mother just returned the nursing home application. No, she hasn't signed it yet.
The tax cut plan arrived today. Deep cuts, as promised.
yes dear, I think I got the point
All I asked for was a gentle reminder.
I told her there was no point in HANDWRITTEN stories these days.
I'm starting to feel the sword is mightier than the pen.
9-1-1? I have reason to believe there's a contract out on me.
This paperwork is killing me
I was wrong, they pinned it on me.
Yes, I received it today -- but just to be clear, I requested online billing.
Yes Honey, the grocery list is still where you put it.
Is it too late to take out the 'over-my-dead-body' clause?
Yes, I have a copy of the divorce agreement.
Gretchen, your old boyfriend was here...yes, he left a message...
First you threaten to shove your divorce papers up my ass, then you stab me in the back with your demands, and now you want me to leave my response after the beep. It hurts, Eleanor; it really hurts.
RE-PRE-SEN-TA-TIVE.
Yes, Doctor, I do work in the White House. Why do you ask?
No, it's not a metaphor this time.
Is it too late to settle?
I've just left the Trump administration and I'm looking for a new position...
It's official. The divorce papers have been served.
I think my wife found our love letters.
Yes, I got your message. I must say I found it somewhat hurtful.
Her parting words will stick with me for a while.
How can you say I'm oblivious?
I'm not wild about their counter-offer.
No, I don't mean that figuratively.
Yes Sir, it's Mr. Herman again. I called yesterday, complaining about the way your boy was delivering my newspaper.
On the bright side: I feel a sense of closure.
Yes, your new divorce attorney contacted me directly.
Yes, I have reconsidered, I would like to receive my bank statements by email instead.
Dr. Mackey, do you have any experience removing a subpoena?
No, I'm not speaking metaphorically.
The good news is she signed the divorce agreement.
I was literally stabbed in the back with the new contract..... what?.......yes I KNOW what "literally" means......
As I told you the last time you called, I’m on the “National Do Not Stab” list.
Got it. Next time just click "I Agree."
She served me herself. Is that legal?
No, Jack, I'm just a clerk. I don't think I'm going to need my own personal attorney. The White House has my back.
Call me paranoid if you want, but I get the feeling that something's going on behind my back
Yes, Mr. President, I prefer this to Twitter.
How the hell do I know what they want?
No, I feel like they're demands rather than suggestions.
My wife personally served me with divorce papers.
Sure it hurts. But it’s just her opinion.
Yes, I suppose a flaming arrow would have been worse.
I'm beginning to think she was serious about the divorce.
Ace Detective Agency?...Someone's trying to pin something on me
Yes, I think its fair to characterize her lawyer as difficult.
It only hurts when I lie down.
Stop trying to pin this one on me
I made the mistake of asking for her ultimatum in writing.
No, it only hurts when I try to read the fine print.
No, you didn't interrupt anything. We're just celebrating the 500th anniversary of the reformation.
No, it's NOT a metaphor!
No, I think I can state with some certainty she won't be signing any prenuptial agreement.
I think I have a contract out on me.
...because, I wouldn't sign this stupid anti-gun petition!
Could you pick up some more Post-Its, Margaret?
A description? I’m pretty sure he was Lutheran.
Yes, please. I'd like to report a manifesto...
I'd like to report an overzealous process server.
Honey, I forgot where you put the to-do list?
I think she suspects us.
Can I call you back? I just got an urgent message.
She made it pretty clear that she wants a divorce.
Oh, and your acupuncturist said the check bounced
This time I think they mean business, Phil.
It’s death. And taxes. I should go.
Yes, I believe the divorce papers were just served.
Yes, please tell Martin I got his message.
The good news is she signed first.
I'm pretty sure my wife just served me divorce papers.
No sir, the writing is not on the wall.
911? My wife ran out of Post-its...
Every time something goes wrong, why do you pin it on me?
There's a little push back on the pre-nup.
I'm having second thoughts about this Lutheran thing.
...Yup, she finally signed the divorce papers.
It seems I misunderstood when you said you had my back.
Yes...literally & figuratively
And I felt personally threatened by the tone of this letter as well!
What grocery list?
No, I don't think it's another 'KICK ME' sign. This one feels different.
Well, of course there's a back story...
It's not being backstabbed that hurts, it's the lengthy explanation that came with it.
If you're trying to send a message, I prefer email.
Yes, I'd like to register a complaint about your past due accounts notification policy…
Im afraid I’m stuck with this contract.
Et tu, Brenda?
It's going to be my second divorce. First time with a Lutheran, though.
Et tu, IRS?
Edwina? It's Milton. I think she may be on to us.
This is why I prefer email.
Lucy means business with her Christmas list this year.
Yes, I got the message from your attorney...
I learned an important lesson: Don't bring an essay to a knife fight
No, the mother of my children served the papers herself. I think she's serious.
I wouldn't exactly say she GAVE me the divorce papers.
Yes, I get the point
I took the kids’ phones and told them to communicate the old fashioned way, like you suggested.
I just knew you'd try to pin this on me.
Police? I want to report a literary crime.
I just got served the divorce papers. Actually she served them herself .
I looked everywhere. You did not leave me the shopping list.
Yes, I received the attached copy.
I came home to a "Spear John" letter.
I got your message.
If you ask me, the Jehovah's Witnesses in this neighborhood are getting a little aggressive.
She wants a divorce. It hurts too much to talk about it.
I'd like to lodge a complaint with your paperboy.
no dad, the prenuptial was not well received..............
Hi Honey, I just received my buy out. No, it's everything I expected.
My ex had the divorce papers delivered; I'm just having a hard time getting to them.
Hi, I’m calling to switch to paperless billing.
Well no, it was not posted where I could see it.
The cable company has convinced me to switch to paperless billing.
At this point I’d have to say a divorce is imminent
Hello, Comcast? I'm having an issue with my bill.
Would you hold on for a minute? Someone's trying to get through to me.
Yes Marsha, your lawyer has been here with the divorce papers.
Am I now to assume an uncontested divorce is out of the question?
I got your note.
Next time, could you keep it to just TALKING behind my back?
I'd like to report and attempted murder and some very hurtful criticism.
I’d like to order some flowers for my wife.
Apparently she has 95 complaints
Caesar residence, Julius speaking
The divorce papers were served today.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.
She's not here now but she left a message.
The divorce papers? Yes, she delivered them this morning.
I suspect they're plotting something behind my back.
Don't be silly, Mom, we're both looking forward to your visit.
This is the third time this week I’ve been mistaken for a church door.
Oh, not a whole lot... Susan finally dropped off the divorce papers this morning
But the good news is, the demands themselves are quite reasonable.
IRS? Is this regarding my back taxes?
You left a message?
Did you get your pink slip the same way I did?
No need to explain further, I got the point.
It's about your process server.
I think the IRS is serious this time Lauren."
It's the harshest rejection letter I've ever gotten.
Got your note. I’m troubled by one sticking point.
Hi hun, your ex was over and left a list of his stuff. By the way, remember when I said that you were a bit harsh in calling him a 'back-stabbing S.O.B'?
The divorce papers arrived.
Yes, I was served the papers, and no, I haven't read them yet.
Next time just send me a text.
No, not separation. She's calling it "Reformation."
Gotta go. My "Honey-do" list just arrived.
Stabbing pain would be an accurate symptom.
She left a note, but I can't read it.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure that's not an appropriate way to serve divorce papers.
Cancel me for the foursome. The wife's 'honey do' list just took on a more urgent tone.
Hey, Maury, you know those divorce papers you drew up for me, the ones I thought I lost? My wife just found them!
She read it ,but I am not sure she is going for it.
It would appear she didn't agree to the terms of the divorce.
What do you mean you're divorcing me because I'm an oblivious idiot?
Honey, why do we have a framed picture of a potted plant? And where did we put the bulletin board?
Does our new health insurance cover stab wounds? I have all the paperwork attached.
The fine print is killing me.
Hello, Murder Mystery Monthly? I'd like to switch to your online edition.
I'd love to but I'm stuck at home with a big to-do list...
Well if I could read the instructions I’d get it out myself.
Yes, she just gave me the eviction notice.
I liked it better when he was tweeting his messages.
I'm not positive, but something tells me it's divorce papers...
Unfortunately, I won't be able to sleep on it.
Well, yes, I’m fairly certain she’s already contacted a lawyer.
...and now my back-stabbing wife wants me to sign the divorce papers!
I have the list of demands, but I haven't gotten around to reading them.
Well, my wife thinks I should get another quote.
It may be an offer we can't refuse.
Et tu, Janet?
I received your complaint but haven't gotten around to reading it yet.
I got more feedback on my manuscript.
I seem to have ignored the first few notices.
So that's a definite no?
No, ma'am, when I say, 'stabbed in the back,' I mean I need an ambulance not an attorney.
She's amazingly literate for someone so violent.
I'm not saying that you didn't leave a note, I'm saying that I didn't find a note.
I’d like to order a box of Post-it notes.
Hi, Mr. Mueller. I'm calling to let you know that Don Jr. just responded to our latest request for his records.
Who do I call to get taken off this mailing list?
The Republicans just delivered their final version of the 'Repeal & Replace' Health Care bill
Hello, billing? I've finally decided to go paperless.
The handwriting is hard to make out, but I don't think it's good news.
I didn't get a good look at him, but I'm pretty sure he was a contract killer.
Hello, is this The Mafia Daily? Yes? I'd like to switch to the Digital edition please.
Ix-nay on the pre-nup.
Yes, I'd like to report an obituary.
I don't know, back in my day it was just "kick me".
She was not crazy about the prenup idea
Hi. I think I need a divorce attorney.
Well, you could say I’ve been served.
I think they are trying to make a point.
Independent third party mediation may not work in this case.
Et tu, Wells Fargo?
Yes, I'd like to go paperless.
Well, let's just say the editor thought the manuscript needed more work.
As far as prenups go, it could have been worse
No I can't hold.
I was pained by your message.
The good news is there's a signed confession.
Yes, the divorce settlement agreement just arrived.
Our new health insurance plan has arrived.
Apparently, there is no grace period.
You'll find a note attached from my wife.
She did leave a note, but no forwarding address.
So I take it you didn't like the edits?
Your letter pains me.
I won't be into work today. My wife stuck me with the grocery list.
I got the bill from the acupuncturist today.
She served the divorce papers herself.
I used to feel like I was on top of my to-do list, but now it's killing me.
Yes Dear, by the way your Mother came by and left you a note.
Yeah, I don’t think she wants to talk it over anymore.
My back-stabbing wife just filed for divorce.
I'd like to place an obituary.
It’s like this nagging pain that someone is trying to tell me something.
Hello Mom I hate to tell you this, but I think the wedding is off.
I'd like to reschedule our couples counseling session
It's the thoughts that hurt.
Hello, Jim. Can we rewrite the prenuptial agreement?
No I can’t read what it says
Roman Catholic. Why do you ask?
Yes her depression has lifted significantly since she's been practicing her direct communication skills.
Honey, I would sign the divorce papers if I could reach them.
Yes, I'd like to file a complaint about how my newspaper is being delivered.
The homeowner association left a notice, they said they won't be as friendly next time.
It says "middle class tax relief"....
All I said was, "Before the wedding, I think we should take a stab at writing a pre-nup."
If I could read it, I wouldn't be calling you.
I'd like to report a...yes, I'll hold.
What goodbye note?
"I don't know... it usually just says 'kick me.'
Ok.. you made your point...
Never discuss divorce with an angry Lutheran.
No, the divorce isn't quite final yet.
I don’t know. She didn’t even leave a note.
Between C7 and T1 a sharp but relatively shallow pain.
Is the pre-nup still good if there's a little blood on it?
Let's just say she's serious about the divorce.
This is not what I meant by more direct communication!
Well, let's just say she wasn't too thrilled when I showed her the prenup.
Yes dear, the divorce papers have arrived.
I meant attach the document to an email.
Yes, I'd like to report a Reformation.
I've been stabbed in the back before, but never by an English major.
No, it does not say "kick me".
I'd like to opt out of notifications, please
I saw her reviewing the prenup, but I can't see whether she signed it.
Yes dear, I did hear from your lawyer.
No...she's not here, but she left a note.
Yes, I would like to change my notification settings.
No, I haven't read it yet but I think I've got the general concept.
That's right. I was attacked by a Lutheran.
I think I said "more backstory" one too many times.
I can’t read it but I know it must be important.
No, I don't know what it says but I think she's upset.
"Middle class tax cuts". This isn't what I had in mind.
It turns out, I do have a backbone.
Ok. You can go back to using all caps to get my attention.
An email would have been sufficient.
I'd like to get something off my back.
Sam, She signed the divorce papers.
Frank...its Tom. What's the customary way of serving divorce papers?
She can't come to the phone right now. She's simmering.
Well, I did ask him to take a stab at the speech.
No, divorce is when they stab you in the heart. This is just your standard student loans.
In my opinion the cancellation penalty is a bit harsh.
I'm not that Harvey Weinstein.
No, I don’t think this is going to be an amicable divorce.
Got your note. A simple "yes" or "no" text would have been sufficient.
Never mind. I just received it.
I'm pretty sure the prenup is a nonstarter.
Do you remember where you put my will?
I would love to join you Bob , but I have to conquer this to do list before it kills me.
I think maybe my wife found a letter from my mistress.
Frankly, in retrospect, I would have preferred a Dear John text!
And can you send those refrigerator magnets with expedited shipping?
No, I didn’t misuse the word ‘literally.’
I'd call it more of a stabbing pain...
Yes, hello. I'd like to sign up to receive my statements online.
Yes, Congress has taken a stab at tax reform.
You said the charges would not stick.
She signed the pre-nup. Now what?
Let's just say she wouldn't sign the prenup...
I would like to cancel the paper delivery.
I think she's moved from cloak to dagger
Yeah, I got the memo.
No, I don't mean that metaphorically.
Hello, Jake from State Farm?
I'm sensing this goes deeper than just words.
Et tu, Alice
I just didn't think this was what they meant by "middle-class tax cut."
Honey, did you say you left me a grocery list somewhere?
Sorry, but I'll have to skip the game today. Marge just reminded me of a few things on the "to do" list.
She didn't sign the prenup.
Yes, they've definitely pinned it on me.
It took a wee bit of compromise, but I finally got her to sign them.
I never thought receiving a 'Dear John' letter would hurt so much.
Don't believe the suicide note.
The worst part is the prose is terrible.
The cable bill came. Apparently, our promotional rate ended.
I'd like to report a threatening letter.
No, she did not sign the divorce papers.
I think we're beyond mediation.
Yes, the divorce is now final.
No, I don't mean that figuratively.
Hello, I would like to report a heretic.
I’m telling you, there’s a contract out on me.
It's more of a "Honey Don't" list
I think I have just been served.
No, I can't read them, but I'm pretty sure they're divorce papers.
You're going to have to read it for me but I got the gist.
Couldn’t you have just texted me?
I had hoped she'd file divorce papers, but it still hurts.
I feel as though she doesn't want to talk about it
You win. Can I pay on the phone?
I'd like to start getting my phone bill by email.
I'm guessing they thought our offer was a little low.
Unfortunately, I can confirm his story about why he didn't turn in his homework.
Hello John? My wife finally signed the divorce papers.
Yes, officer, she did leave a note before she went missing.
Sure I can hold.
Well, we've certainly moved past 'idle threats'. How are you?
He said his name was Luther. Martin Luther. L-u-t-h-e-r.
Your mother has 95 complaints against me and it hurts.
I'm quite certain she's not coming back
I think the attacker may have left a note.
Judging from the way I was served, I suspect divorce is no longer just an idle threat.
You win. You lawyer is better than mine.
Ok. OK! I'll switch to e-billing.
If you think the Jehovah's Witnesses are bad, wait until you see these Lutherans.
No mom. I think it's more of a 'dear Julius' letter.
I want to file a complaint about your process server
I take it you didn't like my edits.
Yes, I'm fairly certain the divorce papers have arrived.
I think we're out of post-it notes.
I'm not sure, what does a Dear John letter look like?
I believe my wife might be filing for divorce.
This time I think she's serious about her to do list.
Yes, he left of demands. No, I can’t read them to you.
Yes, I guess she could have used a Post-it note.
Apparently, I failed to agree with the terms of service.
She served the divorce papers this morning.
I have a feeling this divorce procedure is going to be more acrimonious than we thought.
My sense is we still don't have agreement on the terms.
I think she’s serious about this divorce thing.
Sheila, where did you put the divorce papers?
Arlene was less than enthusiastic when I asked her to sign a prenuptial agreement.
No. What "Dear John" letter?
Unsubscribe
Okay...I got the point...what's the message?
You can just go back to slipping the menus under the door.
Sorry, you just missed her.
I'm not sure what are his demands are, but he definitely has my attention.
One student really nailed his thesis on Martin Luther.
Fine, Lois, I'll sign, but one point is still bothering me.
I can’t get my hands on that document right now.
I got your note but haven't been able to read it yet.
Yes, Maude, I got your text, email and the letter stuck to the knife in my back. Thanks for checking.
Honey, I'm painfully aware of your to-do list.
It seems we've run out of post it notes.
Don't expect me to take this lying down.
I’ve heard from your lawyer.
The divorce is final and I got the cutlery!
I don't think my fiance is going to sign those prenuptial papers.
I can't come in today -- I'm stuck at home.
Occasionally, the sword is actually mightier than the pen.
What divorce papers?!
hello Amazon, I'd like to report a drone misfire
No, counseling is not an option.
You put the instructions on the back of what?
Yes, they are sharp words dear, but I do get the point.
My wife says she was inspired by Martin Luther.
Your mother stopped by and left you a note.
Well, the good news is she finally signed the divorce papers.
She has a few more amendments to the Prenup.
Yes, she is serious about the divorce.
I think the trial separation ship has sailed.
that note you let...I'm having difficulty reading it.
Did I get the pre-nup back? Yea, I got the pre-nup back.
OK, so just what DOES constitute "irreconcilable differences?
After she presented me the papers, I said “Why don’t you just go ahead and stab me back while you’re at it?” Boy, am I glad I didn’t say anything about testicles!
Hello. Is Martin Luther there?
Yes dear, I got your note.
Well, the good news is that I'm on the front page...
No officer, I haven't had a chance to read the ransom note yet.
I want out. This contract is killing me.
So I assume an amicable divorce is out of the question?
Not sure yet , but I think she wants a divorce
And THEN he said, 'if you have already made a payment, please disregard this reminder'...
I'm calling to complain about your process server.
Yes, I feel the criticism was very pointed.
Hello, Equifax? I've got some lingering questions about the 'Terms of Service Agreement' that your special courier just delivered.
I thought we agreed to bury the hatchet.
I'm not sure what it says
Hi, can you help me change my delivery preferences?
No, she's not coming back. I haven't read the note yet, but the signs are pretty clear.
Yes, I'd like to cancel my home delivery service.
The wedding is still on, but she’d like a few changes in the prenup.
. . .she was quite pointed with her demands.
But the good news, my darling, is that she finally signed the divorce papers.
Yes, her attorney just served me with the divorce papers.
So then I said, I would rather stick a knife through my back than sign this contract
A Post-It would have been perfectly adequate.
They did send a rather pointed message.
My wife took a stab at filing for divorce.
All I said to her is, I can't believe you have all those issues with me, I would like to see a list!
I think someone in the office might be a back stabber.
He left me this really passive aggressive note.
'I don't think it's a love letter; more like a list of grievances...'
I didn't get to read it yet, but I have a sneakng suspicion this is their final notice .
I'd like to report an overzealous process server.
Yes, she's just given me feedback on the settlement.
No, I don't think it's going to be amicable.
A back due notice has been brought to my attention.
Are you saying you don' t want to give marriage counseling a go?
It's not that she broke it off, it's the way she did it that hurts more than anything else
Yes, I’m calling him a back-stabber. No, I don’t mean it metaphorically.
I'd like to report a malicious posting.
My wife makes a strong point
It's a rather threatening note.
Yup, the back pain is getting worse, and I still can't find the will.
Can't you just leave a message on my voicemail like everyone else?
I jokingly told her to take a stab at it.
It’s just a feeling I have
So, do you remember when he promised he’d take care of us…health insurance for everybody…tax cuts for the middle class..?
Kushner speaking.
...but the good news is she signed the divorce papers.
Yes dear you made your point, words do hurt.
Apparently I have been served.
No, I haven't seen your 10 page letter about me being insensitive and unfeeling.
Yes, She gave me the divorce papers...a few minutes ago...No, I need to talk to a doctor before I sign anything.
I think it's time to ditch the landline. The bill is literally killing me.
Why yes, she did leave a note...
No, I haven't seen your note yet, but I have a feeling about it.
As if the knife in the back wasn't self explanatory.
Wittenberg Residence
Where did you leave it?
I'm tired of always getting stuck with a long list of chores.
No need to come to the E.R. Mr. Jones, that’s just the new middle class tax cuts your feeling.
I have a great back story to tell you, if only I could get around to it.
I got a rather pointed response.
My back hurts and, no, I did't see your stupid note
Hey Roger, so let me tell you how that whole prenup issue went over....
I just got the newest version of the tax reform bill.
Describe my symptoms? Well, I'm feeling a little listless, and there's a stabbing pain in my back.
This new ‘Rate Your Professor’ interface is problematic.
Is this the Anger Management Hotline?
Hi, Bob. Can you come over and read something for me?
The kids are taking their Reformation studies a little too seriously.
Oh, no! You're not pinning this one on me!
You know that spot right in the middle of your back that you just can't reach?
Yes, I received your attachment.
I sense you've been letting things build up again.
The complaints may be justified, but not the delivery.
Well, regardless of whether their demand list is reasonable, I have a small issue with the delivery method.
Can you recommend a good lawyer? I'm sure it's going to be a bitter divorce.
Honey, Do you know what happened to the "to do" list I left for you on the refrigerator?
Mrs. Luther, please come pick up Marty. He’s totally out of control.
I can't. I'm stuck at home.
What do you mean, "Is there a backstory?"
I don't think this is how arbitration is supposed to work.
I guess this finalizes our divorce.
We're out of Post-it notes again.
Yes, dear. I got your note. It came as quite a surprise.
Yes, dear, but I haven't read it yet!
What––you couldn't just text?
My acupuncturist made a point of informing me of his cancellation policy.
Well, the divorce is final.
I'd like to stop my mail please.
No, things are not improving at work.
I think she means it, this time.
You couldn't have had a sheriff's deputy deliver the divorce papers like everyone else?
I think because of my rogue apostrophes.
I'd like to report what I think is a hate crime.
I think it’s just a paper cut.
Honey, I'm sorry to bother you at work but where did you leave the grocery shopping list??
No, I haven't read your letter, but I get the point.
Yes, an ambulance and a pen.
Yes, I did receive your previous message, thank you.
Hold off on the ice sculpture. The pre-nup seems to have ticked her off a bit.
On second thought I've decided to accept all the editorial suggestions.
I laughed when she said it was an unauthorized autobiography.
I would like to order a refrigerator
I'd like to switch my subscription to "Online Only" please.
With all due respect Sir, these back taxes are killing me
You had me at "goodbye."
Yes, the divorce papers arrived. Was she angry? I couldn't tell...
So I guess couple's therapy is out of the question.
I got the note.
You left a note? What note?
Hello Anton Press, I just got your rejection of my short story and it was very hurtful.
In the future, can you just e-mail me?
Let me fill you in on my backstory, which is quite painful to discuss.
I just thought the vacuum cleaner was the perfect present.
I gotta tell you, these itemized bills are killing me.
I think I've been served.
Apparently it's gone beyond just cleaning his litter box more often.
Martin Luther, please. Yes, I’ll hold.
She served the divorce papers. Something tells me this is going to be nasty.
I'm looking for a policy that covers a coexisting condition.
She says I've no feelings.
I"m not sure, but I suspect it's a "Dear John" letter.
I guess Mueller is serious about wanting me to come testify.
Yeah, it's the new Obamacare repeal bill. Can't the doctor see me before Tuesday?
All I said was "I don't think a President should tweet".
It was how she delivered the papers that really stung.
911? Help! I just received the tax reform bill.
Well, the ‘Honey Do’ List isn’t so passive-aggressive any more.
I simply asked if they had any Girl Scout cookies that were vegan, gluten free, made in a factory without nuts, and if they were ethically sourced.
Why yes, I did receive your killer memorandum.
It was Admiral Arthur with the Hunting Knife in the Library just as I finished the manuscript. Please send an ambulance.
Yes, it is a bad time.
The news is killing me.
I got your note, but I'm having a hard time seeing your perspective.
Well, I don’t know. How would YOU define ‘emergency’?
I think she took the kids, the silver and most of the cutlery.
I'm sorry I don't have it in front of me but I can only assume I'm in serious trouble.
Divorce papers? Of course I would know if I had been served with divorce papers.
Yes, apparently, my wife has her own list of 95 grievances.
I'd like to report a malicious posting.
Do you recall what we did with the 'Do Not Resuscitate' forms?
I'm getting so much resistance from behind.
Hey... So I got your message
Please cancel my subscription immediately.
Exactly what did you mean when you said, "I've got your back?"
What's black and white and red all over?
Yes, Mary left me a dear John letter, but I can’t put my hands on it.
Yes, I got your list of demands.
No, the handwriting is definitely not on the wall.
I have not read the fine print, no.
Martin, for the 95th time, your thesis proposal was not accepted.
I think she's serious this time.
I'm not denying that I owe the money. I'm taking issue with your collection methods.
It would be easier to read if you'd just left it on the nightstand.
I'm assuming my manuscript was rejected.
I said I'll take a stab at paying the bills. Then she said she had a better idea.
I'd like to make a back payment.
I just got served with divorce papers.
Note? What note?
The divorce is going about as well as I expected.
You could have used tape.
I haven't read it yet, but I think she wants a divorce.
She not signing the pre nup.
Yes the knife hurts, but the disclaimers are killing me.
Yes, she got back to me on the proposed changes to the prenup.
Hey - I need for you to come over,and read something to me.
No, it’s more of a stabbing pain.
Hi sweetie, where did you say you put the grocery list?
I received your final notice.
She left. She wouldn't sign the prenup.
No, she left a few minutes ago, but she did leave a homocide note.
Yes, he is a back stabber. Why do you ask?
I haven’t gotten around to reading it.
I don't know what the terms of divorce are, but they sure hurt.
Their reply was pointed, to say the least.
Get me my lawyer. And my doctor.
I'm not angry, it just hurts.
Good news. We can set the date. My wife signed the divorce papers.
I have the feeling that a number of pointed remarks were made about me behind my back
I'll go ahead and shoot you a reply.
911? Yeah, I've got this stabbing pain in my divorce papers... er, back...
The divorce papers just arrived.
I have questions about your terms and conditions.
No, I think this time she really means it.
A PDF would have sufficed.
Yes, dear, it hurts more than acupuncture.
Yes,thank you, I received your demands but I can't actually read them.
I’ve tried to read it in the mirror, but the print is backwards.
No, I think I can state with some certainty that she won't sign the prenuptial agreement you prepared?
Marjorie, I'm having trouble reading your to-do list.
I’d like to report a death by fake news.
Sorry, Martin Luther just left.
I think she’s serious about the divorce this time.
Hi Hon. I used two mirrors to read your letter. You seem angry.
Hello,9-1-1? I think I just received a death threat.
The new tax regulations are here.
Hi, I just received my health care plan renewal notice, and I have a few questions.
Yes, I received your Final Demand notice.
The divorce papers came today.
Yes, I’ve been served the divorce papers. No, I haven’t had a chance to read them yet.
I get your point...but I'm not happy about it!
I'd like to order a mirror, please.
It says 'Kick me,' more or less.
I got your note and just want to let you know I feel your pain.
Yes, she delivered the divorce papers this morning.
He said, "You've been served....oh, and your wife wants the knife back"
You could say our relationship ended on a bad note.
I'm sorry sir, but we don't cover backstabbing
Hello, I would like to request a retraction.
What letter?
These manuscript rejections are killing me.
I'm sure there's an emoticon that would have worked just as well.
Hello, Roman Times? About your paper boy, Brutus...
It's for me but I can't read it.
I'M CALLING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW YOUR PAPER IS DELIVERED!!
At this moment it's a little difficult to read the fine print.
So much for "The Art of the Deal."
My wife’s to do list is killing me.
All I remember was that he looked like a monk
I got your message and I feel your pain.
Sorry , I will not be in today, my marriage is going through a reformation.
To add insult to injury, they charged me with carrying a concealed weapon!
I'm sorry I have to cancel our poker game tonight, Charlie, but I just got an urgent note from my wife that forces me to change plans.
Tell the Pope that Luther is at it again
When she said, “I’ve got your back,” I thought it was a good thing.
Can I please speak to a Doctor of Letters?
I'd like to order a bulletin board for my wife.
I get your point.
Emergency ? I have a list of demands attached to my back with a knife . I would like to know what the demands are.
I’d like to switch to auto-pay.
Yes, I got my wife's list of grievances.
No, dear, I am just saying that's what refrigerator magnets are for.
I liked your manuscript it's spine tingling.
Yes. The divorce papers just arrived.
Brute? Et Tu?
I found your note. Are you mad at me?
The difference is that Luther nailed his doctrines on a CHURCH DOOR!
No, I haven't read your message
Yeah, I got your message. It's just a little hard to read.
I made some good points, but his presentation was far more compelling.
Hello, 911? I have a feeling that the mob put a contract out on me.
The job started ok but now the paperwork's killing me.
About your final notice...
Well, no, I didn't read it yet, but something tells me it's bad.
Yeah, I think she's really serious this time.
I need an appointment to review a legal document; today would be great.
I got your divorce papers.
I need to speak to the attorney, my wife just served me papers!
I think she's really serious about the divorce!
Consider me served.
I'd like to register a complaint about your subpoena service.
Remember what she said about sticking it to me?
She's hired very assertive divorce lawyers.
I'd like to report a contract killing.
She doesn't suspect a thing.
It went better than I thought. She brought over the divorce papers to sign, gave me a big old hug and out the door she went.
Remember that idea you had for sticky notes?
I DO know what you mean, the news is killing me too!
Let's keep the date. My wife just filed for divorce.
Mildred, did you see the suicide note I left by the phone this morning?
But Mr. Luther, I'm not even Catholic?
Who do I talk to about someone posting a hate message?
Yes, I got my performance review today.
Tell me it doesn't say 'Kick Me'!
No, this time I think she's really gone.
If that's your demand letter, I'd hate to see your cease-and-desist.
Hello, Mr. Luther? Did you not see me standing in the doorway?
Can you repost Martin's document as a pdf?
Yes Mother, I received my divorce papers. As a matter-of-fact she was kind enough to deliver them in person.
Honey...where is that note that said why you are leaving me?
On second thought, I'd prefer the online edition only.
Hold on, I just got a text.
If I had to guess, I'd say it was a contract killing...
Or, you could just e-mail me
It isn't a very good severance package.
I'm calling to unsubscribe from your newsletter
Stabbing me in the back wasn't enough, Stanley? You had to add the notes from the morning meeting?
Yes, baby doll, I marched right in and demanded a divorce. Then, as I marched out, she made an excellent point.
Yeah... I think they're really serious about this eviction notice.
I just feel that the GOP is taking ‘death and taxes’ a bit too literally with this new bill
Honey, you're going to kill me, but I can't find the grocery list again.
I have a feeling she really means it this time!
I think it's time we switched to electronic bill delivery.
I don't think the terms are negotiable.
I think I'm going to agree to counseling. She's made it pointedly clear that we have much to discuss.
I can't read it, but I don't think it's good.
Hello-Cheryl? Yeah, I think my wife knows about us.
Tell them I'm ready to settle
I get your point.
No, I have not been able to read the note yet ...
Hi, she wouldn't sign the prenup.
Stop being a grammar Nazi, I know what “literally” means.
Let’s just say she didn’t sign the NDA, Mr Weinstein
I need you to come over read read something to me.
I have been looking dear- I can't find it anywhere!
I'm starting to think she's serious about getting that divorce.
Yeah, I need an appointment with Dr. Wallace. I've got a suspicious subpoena on my back I want him to take a look at.
Okay, but that's not what people usually mean when they say "I'm gonna stick it to you!"
I’m calling about the ‘offer I can’t refuse’...
So I presented the prenup you suggested...
I'll try to make sense of the thing, but it's going to be a reach.
I'm just trying to put the whole thing behind me.
I am not insensitive.
I get that you are upset with me. But this is not how we communicate in the digital age.
Well yes, she did really drive the point home.
Honey. It's me. I can't seem to find your to-do list anywhere.
Yes, Mrs. Jones, technically Billy did turn in his homework...
911 - this is a contractual emergency
Yes, I think I got the message.
Yes, she just finished the chapter on the Protestant Reformation.
Your mother stopped by.
Just tell him I got the message!
Yes, dear, I got the divorce papers...nice touch on the Process Server.
Hello, may I speak to Martin Luther?
I thought the next step after Mediation was Arbitration.
No golf today guys, my wife has stuck me with a To Do List.
Not to worry, dear, it's just where you left it.
No. I am sorry you missed her. She just left.
Her actions speak louder than her words.
I haven't read it yet, but I'm pretty sure she's claiming irreconcilable differences.
I'm sure my wife left a reminder. I'll look around for it.
Sweetie, it seems you forgot to sign the prenup.
This metaphor is killing me.
No, I haven't read the note. Were you listening when I talked about the knife?
Yes, I’m aware it’s March 15th.
I think that I must have said "Fake News" too many times.
Mark, if you wanted me to read your new screenplay, you could have just asked.
He said it was too important to put into an e-mail.
About that comment you made yesterday that "You had my back"...
Please tell Mr. Luther I received his 95 complaints.
"You certainly made your point!!!
I found your note.
Yes, a sharp pain just below the payment due amount.
No mom, she means it this time. She stuck me with divorce papers.
Barbara, it's one thing to stab me in the back, but lying about leaving me a letter takes the cake.
I think I get your point.
And you say I can't remove it without paying early termination fees?
No mom, it's not my imagine. There's no doubt in my mind Claire wants a divorce.
Honey, I've been served.
But everyone defaults on student loans
Your lawyer just visited and served the divorce papers
She said the document was attached, but I don't see it.
I'm sorry Mr. President, but I don't think as the FBI Director I should be expected to sign your loyalty pledge.
No, I didn't read "Terms and Conditions" before clicking "I agree."
It all started with simple 'kick me' signs taped to my back.
Yes Doris I was served with the divorce papers papers.
There's one point in the contract I wasn't too crazy about.
So is that a hard 'No' to getting back together?
Just tell the doctor that I need to know how to delete a message.
Hi Honey. Do you remember what you did with that pre-nup I asked you to sign?
I agree in principle, but there is still one sticking point.
Bad news....The IRS stuck me with back taxes again.
I've had a hunch that my days as a powerful, white male were numbered, but now I'm quite certain.
I'd like to report a delivery problem.
You make a good point.
"What note"?
Yes. I did get the divorce papers from your lawyer.
The IRS have changed their notification methods.
yes dear, I think I got the point
Hello, 911, my wife is missing. She left me a note, but I can't read it.
She hired a Lutheran lawyer.
I have this bad feeling that my manuscript was rejected.
"OK, you've convinced me to go with paperless bills.".
You could have done this via voicemail...
"if this is what you meant when you said 'you'll have my back' it's time to end our relationship
Late payments department? I’d like to set up online billing, please.
By the way, World of Cutlery has responded to our letter of complaint.
Yes, Mom, I suppose it is poetic.
I’m trying not to take my performance review personally.
Is it valid service of process if they left it where I can't see it?
I think you know the point of this call.
This one appears to be enforceable.
Eventually I did get her to sign the divorce papers.
Yes, I did receive your previous message.
911? I’d like report a Russian ad trying to influence my vote.
Well, the divorce is final.
Dying. What are you doing?
His message has a point.
What if you don't actually touch the subpoena?
The GOOD NEWS is that they left a list of demands, and I have it with me.......
I'm ready to sign the divorce papers.
My wife finally signed the divorce papers!
I need to talk to my attorney. My wife personally served the divorce papers.
Yes, my submission received another violent rejection...
Mrs. Luther? I need to talk to you about your son.
She really stabbed me in the back with these divorce papers.
A string around a finger would have sufficed.
You have been processing my claim for six months and my acupuncturist is demanding immediate payment.
They smiled in my face -- so I assume it says they want to take my place.
It was a very odd exit interview.
For starters, can a party to a divorce serve the petition herself?
No, I haven't read it yet.
Let's just say that her divorce lawyer really stabbed me in the back.
I showed her the prenup. She said she’d think about it.
I'm calling to make an appointment for a chiropractic adjustment. I have a stabbing pain between my shoulder blades that you wouldn't believe.
No, Dear, I can't find it anywhere.
It appears I've been mistaken for a church door.
Ransom note? What ransom note?
You were right, Mother. I shouldn't have shown her the will.
Actually, my wife just delivered her divorce filing papers in person.
my wife said she left the divorce papers somewhere in the back, but I don't know exactly where.
I thought you said the writing was on the wall?
I get the point, Helen.
Her remarks were rather pointed.
A simple "overdue" notice would have sufficed!
Hello, Circulation ? I'd like to increase my annual Christmas tip to my carrier.
Yes officer, the University of Wittenberg’s chapel door.
That’s when I realized she was giving me a back message and not a back massage.
My ex did say she'd stick it to me.
No, it's not my lower back.
I avoided getting served as long as I could.
Yes, I had lunch with my editor.
Yes, dear, I got your message.
O.K., I'll read it. Love you too.
Yes, I have been served the divorce papers.
Yes, she left one -- but I can't quite read it now.
I'm fine, it's just a papercut.
No, I really think this is their best and final offer.
The printer is acting up again.
Room Service? Can you send up a physician, and maybe a coroner?
My "don't kill the messenger" line didn't really go over like I thought it would.
no, I havent had a chance to read the contract
Yes, I am aware of your customer service contract. I just found it hard to read.
I'll get back to you. These Lutherans really mean business.
Tell my attorney I believe that I may have just been served with the divorce papers.
No, I mean it literally. The divorce feels like a stab in the back.
She really stuck it to me this time.
Yes, it's true, I did ask that you shouldn't leave my newspaper on the floor anymore .
I just got served with the divorce papers.
Yes Martin... I got your message.
I just got the terms of our divorce.
Yes, Condé Nast subscriptions? I did indeed enjoy the New Yorker trial subscription, but for the third time, I would like to cancel.
I've reconsidered my options. Please restore standard voicemail immediately.
Sorry boss, I can't come to work today. I've got a stabbing pain in my back and I can't find my files.
No, this time I think she really means it.
It was more the way I was served.
Yes mother, l think the divorce is final.
I got your note.
A text would have been less painful.
I tried serving her the papers but she didn't take it well.
She left a note.
I’m sorry, but I can’t seem to find the divorce papers you served me.
Other than that, no complaints, yourself?
No, her lawyer delivered it in person.
I'd like to order a cork board and some push pins, please.
Of course I'm sure no one is getting backstabbed.
I need to ask my lawyer what constitutes being legally served.
Well, no. I actually haven't read it yet, but I'm pretty sure it's very hostile.
Message received, Mr. President.
In the future, Mr. Luther, if you have any complaints, please post them on my office door
I agreed to take a stab at the new healthcare bill, and it just went downhill from there
Mom, I think Tina has left me.
Be careful-- the small print will kill you.
Can you explain, to the employees, what we mean by pinning their response to the bulletin board.
I think I get your point.
OK, so you did not like my suggestion eh?
Yes, I know this is 911. I’m telling you, she literally stuck me with divorce papers.
Yes, I got your message.
Yes, I got the reminder!
Yes, dear, I did receive the divorce papers.
Yes, the divorce papers have been served.
I can't bring myself to read her divorce complaint--it hurts too much
Can we take another stab at the prenup tomorrow?
Thank you for calling, but I already got the message.
No, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Hello, Lucille. I would sign the divorce papers if I could find them.
Note? What note?
No, I haven't seen the divorce papers yet.
Come home quickly. I need you to read something to me.
And then her lawyer has the nerve to demand her knife back!
Let's try texting next time.
I think it's a "Dear John" letter.
No, I haven't seen her. But she did leave a "honey do" list.
I feel unfairly targeted.
You win. He's a back-stabber, alright.
Martin Luther called, he left a message about some changes he was enthusiastic about.
Apple has gotten serious with the user agreement for the new iPhone.
No. No note she said I was clueless and left.
Go ahead with the contract, but I have 95 reasons to doubt him.
I can’t talk now. My wife and I are having a discussion.
Hi Chuck? I need you to come over and read something for me.
Sweetie, where did you put my honey-do list?
I got my thesis back. It doesn't look good.
911 ? I NEED HELP TO READ A NOTE MY WIFE LEFT ME !
Yes, I do have a delivery menu on me.
Yes, I do take your actions as a stab in the back.
I believe they are asking me to step aside.
Sorry Jim, I can’t go to the game. I need to take care of the list of chores that Doris left for me.
Yes, she just dropped off the divorce papers.
Well, she signed the prenup.
Yes dear you did make your point.
Yes, I rejected his manuscript, but now I am stuck with it.
Yes, I got the memo. What does it say?
I can't read it. You took the hand mirror too.
She said it was time to ‘stick it to the man’
Yes, she gave me the note but I haven't read it yet.
My "To Do List" is killing me.
Yes, she was here. She served the papers herself.
I got stuck with my own to do list
Yes Amanda, I have been approached by your legal team.
So I take it that you’re not open to negotiate?
Soooo...got your message...
Brutus, from billing ?
I need a doctor, a lawyer, and a talent agent.
Paper cuts are the worst
I think it's from her lawyer
No, my shirt does not say ‘Post No Bills’ on it.
Yes, I dotted my "I's", but I'm afraid my "Ts" have been double-crossed.
Where did you put the divorce papers?
My lawyer has my back, unfortunately my ex wife does too.
You know, I kind of felt like your letter was a complete stab in the back.
Darling, next time leave it on the fridge, I will remember.
If I switch to the unlimited plan is the contract affixed with a smaller knife?
I got my thesis back. It doesn't look good.
It seems that I should have gone with my gut and emailed her a PDF of the divorce papers.
I'm calling to complain about your bill collection practices?
What note? I haven't seen your blloody note!
I just have a feeling that she means it this time.
yes, I got your "honey-do" list.
That’s not what I meant when I said I wanted to put the divorce behind me.
Can you use refrigerator magnets next time you leave me a "honey do" list dear?
Hello 911; I think my wife just left me.
She's not home right now, but she left a detailed note.
Is everything all right? You seemed a little upset this morning.
Congress just delivered our new tax plan.
She STRONGLY rejected the offer.
The news hurt more than usual this morning.
I'm telling you my wife left me and stuck me with all the bills!
No, Doctor, I don't mind that he thinks he's Martin Luther. What I mind is that he thinks I'm the Wittenberg Castle!
As a matter of fact, she gave me 95 reasons she's leaving.
He should just say it to my face.
I think she signed the divorce papers, but I'm not 100% positive.
Game of Thrones rejected my manuscript.
This is non-binding, right?
Just to let you know, I do have an email account.
The divorce decree arrived.
I've decided to agree to your terms after all.
I didn't see it coming.
It's me. Yeah, so the homeowner's association is apparently serious.
Is that you, Brutus?
Hi. Remember how I always say, "The pen is mightier than the sword!"? Funny thing...
Hello, Sol...., I don't think she's gonna go for the pre-nup.
I don't think she's gonna sign the prenup.
May I call you back? I got something pressing to read.
I just got served.
Actually, what hurts most is she could have told me to my face.
Actually, the pain of reading it is far worse,
Yes, she did leave a note.
Yeah, well apparently they do know if you accept the User Agreement without reading it.
What's my emergency? Well, someone is either trying to kill me or convert me.
She took backstabbing to another level
It looks like end of the third marriage. I'm handling it well, but I sense there might be an issue regarding the pre-nup.
I’ve got this nagging feeling that my wife’s asking for a divorce
I can't put my finger on it but I think I'm forgetting something.
So I asked her to give me one example.
I know you think they are 95 good reasons, Martin, but it was still extremely inappropriate.
I'll concede that she made a very effective point with her article.
No. . . but I think it was a Lutheran!
9-1-1? I'd like to report a manifesto.
Mr. Speaker, perhaps you should have been more specific when you said this tax bill would 'have my back.'
I.m calling to complain about my newspaper delivery service.
yes, she left a note.
I asked her to take a stab at reading it.
It's a stabbing pain Harry, and it gets worse when I lie down. Think I should see a doctor?
I can't really read it, but I'm guessing the medium is the message.
Hey, Bob. Yeah, I got the divorce papers but it doesn't look like it will be amicable.
My wife personally served me divorce papers this morning.
Hello, I’d like to make a complaint against the guy who served this subpoena...
You can tell my wife's lawyer I've decided to settle"
Honestly, I don't think they'll be open to renegotiation.
...so you're telling me this isn't covered by my insurance?
Yes I can assure you - this is definitely their final offer.
I'd like to report an unorthodox eviction notice.
I feel like whatever's in the fine print is going to kill me.
I really enjoyed out murder mystery date last night
It was pointed criticism, but I can't grasp the specifics.
Apparently she has 95 complaints
She has some problems with the pre-nup.
My wife found the love letter you sent me.
I still owe the paper boy money
My shirt specifically says, "Post No Bills."
You put it where?
He said his name was Luther. Martin Luther.
This time I think she might really mean it.
I'm going to be late this morning .... my wife just served me divorce papers.
Yes, she just delivered the divorce papers.
I’m getting the feeling that she’s not interested in a no-fault divorce.
Yes, it’s an emergency! Please send an ambulance and an editor.
You can tell your divorce attorney I get the point.
Hello Daily Bugler, is it too late to get an obit in tomorrow's paper?
This is just another example of you going behind my back.
No Mother, the wedding is definitely off. I've received a lengthy Dear John letter and frankly it cuts like a knife.
The job made me an offer I just can't refuse
Yes, I can describe him. It was a monk with a German accent.
Yes, she did leave a note for you and said you'd know where to find it.
He didn't give a last name. Said his first name was Martin.
Hi dear, it's me. Tell me again what I was supposed to do today.
I'm positive I ordered a SINGING telegram.
She's not happy I've filed for divorce but at least she's communicating.
She's adamant. She won't sign the prenup.
Yes the lawyer did make a point of coming by as a matter of fact.
She wants the china, but I can keep the cutlery.
Yes Brutus, I got your letter.
Our landlord just delivered the new lease agreement.
Yes Ethel I have received the divorce papers.
I'm being held hostage. Yes, they have a list of demands. And yes, I think they're serious.
Yeah, I got your note. Very funny.
I dare you to come and say that to my face!
I'd like to report a reformation.
The divorce is final.
There are some issues with the prenup.
I think I've been served.
Unfortunately, the mediator is dead - I think we should settle.
911? My wife's just nailed me with her grievances.
I believe you've been trying to reach me about my late payment.
That's not what I meant when I said you should have my back.
I didn't realize you had left. Did you leave a note?
You were right. I shouldn't have brought the Constitution to a knife fight.
Honey, where did you say you put the to-do list?
I'll call you back. My wife just gave me an ultimatum.
What do you mean, I don't notice you?
Karen, just confirming receipt of your Dear John letter.
Can't come over today, i've been stuck with the to do list
All right, two weeks from Friday at 2:00 pm. And while I'm there, I'd like to get a flu shot too.
Apparently, we don't qualify for long term health care.
Honey, the truce with the paperboy is off.
Margaret, I can't find our Pre-Nup.
I don't know, Doc. All she said was that Post-its weren't working.
Can I call you back, mother? We're just reviewing the prenuptial agreement.
Yes Karen, I received the divorce papers by 'special delivery'...
She has a few suggestions about my will.
I’ve just received a notice about a back payment?
The police are investigating, but I'm almost certain it was Martin Luther.
Divorce Papers Just Came Through, She's Not Happy !!
Hello , Anger Management Center ...
If she left a good-bye note, I haven't seen it.
Hey Bill, What's the name of that divorce attorney you were telling me about?
I think she's maybe considering leaving me, possibly.
Et tu, Con Ed.
No, it isn't just a feeling. I'm sure she wants a divorce.
My wife just left me a note. I think we'll have to pass on the card game tonight.
She delivered the divorce paperwork herself.
Dear, the cook just gave notice.
Yeah, I got the message.
And that's all she wrote.
Hello, Frank? That DYI prenup form may not be quite as helpful as we thought.
Yeah, I got the memo.
I don't think 'amicable' is a possibility anymore.
I'll tell you what the problem is. The problem is I'm not THAT Martin Luther!
How would I know what the note says?
It's not that she served me with divorce papers, it's how she did it that hurts the most.
Yes, dear, I'll be sure to read the article.
I’d like to report a schism.
I'd like to switch to the paperless option for hidden fees.
My order was actually for a back *scratcher*
No, it's 13 across, 6 letters. "Bodkin or Dagger". I'm stuck.
Florence, if you have something to say to me, just say it to my face!
Hang on, I think she just finished the grocery list.
No, I do not have time to take a survey.
Hang on, I know she put it somewhere
No, this time I think she's really serious about the divorce.
Edna left me again, and I think she means it this time.
I don't think we'll be sending little Martin to Catholic school.
I just got your lawyer's outline of a suggested property settlement.
...yeah, but if I don’t take it out of my back, then I haven’t officially been served.
Then I said, "You forged that knife, why not my signature?"
About 9, on a scale of 0 to 10.
I think I just received a hate letter.
She found a sticking point in the divorce settlement.
The contract wasn't quite as iron-clad as we thought.
Honey, where did you leave that to-do list you're always nagging about?
I don't think my wife is willing to sign the divorce papers you served... Any paperless suggestions?
A simple post-it note would have sufficed.
I feel compelled to mention a few sticking points.
Yes, the papers were served—but I must say “blunt” is the wrong adjective to describe their delivery.
You put it where?
Hello, Yes, I'd like to renew my subscription. And also a few more back issues.
Can you represent me? I have just been served the divorce papers. Yes, you could say it was a surprise.
Couldn't you have just SIGNED the divorce papers?
My wife would like to make a few 'tweaks' to our divorce agreement.
Well yes doctor, I would describe it as a stabbing pain in the middle of my back.
A simple 'We will not be publishing your manuscript.' would have been sufficient.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I AM a registered voter.
I got some feedback on the prenuptial proposal.
This is what happens when you divorce a Lutheran.
Would I prefer a high-speed internet service provider for all my data, e-mail, and messaging needs? You betcha.
It seems they didn't think much of our initial offer.
I've just learned that my wife's divorce attorney is a Lutheran
I believe it's a list of grievances.
I'm not sure, but I think that I AM the message.
I'd like to get a quote on a term life policy.
I don’t have a problem with the contract per se. I have a problem with the backstabbing.
It will have to wait. I've been stuck with a new assignment.
He had a medium frame, spoke fluent German, and was wearing a cassock.
Prenup rejected. . . .
Yes, I know, divorce can be painful; but this is different.
Hello Dear. Now, once again, where did you put those divorce papers?
No, dear, I haven't seen your "to do" list.
i think she took the pre-nup pretty well.
I'm pretty sure it's for good this time...
Hello....I thought I had signed up for e-statements.
Hold on a sec. I know I stuck it somewhere.
Speaking as a Lutheran...
Let's just say I won't forget the grocery list again.
How should I know? I don't have eyes in the back of my head.
I'll be late for work today, my neighbor took the 500th anniversary of the Reformation a bit too literal this morning . . .
Yes, she finally got around to serving me the divorce papers.
It seems the figurative implications of my divorce have just become literal.
Yeah, Bob, she didn't accept my apology.
Yes Mom, i'm pretty sure she is not coming back
She was just here.
But on the bright side, she did reply to my letter.
It has come to my attention that we will be getting the breadsticks after all.
Something tells me she's probably not coming back this time...
I think we can view this as a hostile takeover.
I got your message, but I haven't had a chance to read it.
... and where would I find this "policy rider"?
So, Helen dropped off the divorce papers...
They keep saying it's a tax cut for the middle class, I don't know though.
I'd like to report a point too well taken.
"No, I'm pretty sure it won't be amicable".
The termination clause in that contract was brutal.
Washington Post? Thanks for running that article about my affair.
This time I think she's serious about the divorce.
She's gone but I still feel the pain.
out of nowhere...she's filing for divorce!
Mildred knows about us.
Well, she wants a divorce. She was very clear on that.
When she told me she was going to stick me with the mortgage payments, she wasn't kidding!
Next time, just leave voicemail.
Nice touch, Blanch. It's bad enough that you left me and ran off with the circus, but to have your new boyfriend the knife thrower deliver the "Dear John" letter is so "you".
If your letter was an attempt to stab me in the heart, you missed.
My wife stabbing me in the back wasn't the worst part - she attached a shopping list.
...but what hurt the most is when she served me with the divorce papers.
My wife refuses to go paperless.
Wait...seriously? You can't get me in until next month?
On a positive note, my sciatica is cured.
You know Sweetie, there is a bulletin board in the kitchen?
I got your message, but it's hard to see the point.
As it turned out, the only thing Larry hated more than being stuck on hold was being stuck, on hold.
I can't find the divorce papers you left.
Honey, my lawyer says it still needs your signature.
Your mother won't be joining us for lunch.
Upset? I'd notice if she's upset.
Yes, I did get your message.
At least she waited until halftime.
I think someone put a contract out in me.
Sure I'll hold, but it hurts.
Sorry Dear! What list?
Some Republicans thought I was the President!
Okay. You nailed it.
I'm guessing it's the work of some back stabbing lawyer.
Yes, I just received your final offer. Frankly, I feel like I've been stabbed in the back.
She claims I was always turning my back to her and missed her messages.
I have the feeling somebody is trying to tell me something.
Some murder mystery writers do not deal well with rejection.
Hi, front desk? This is Room 127, I'd like to switch to paperless billing.
Does this mean we're not settling?
Yeah, my wife sent over our divorce papers this morning.
I think the IRS is starting to crack down on back taxes.
Hello GOP. Yes, I just got your Republican tax break bill notice from the mailman...interesting delivery method you picked for us in the middle class, good joke, point well made.
Tell my lawyer that I think my wife just served me with papers.
All in all, slightly less excruciating than Twitter
I really don't see your point.
Can we at least talk through some of your 95 reasons for reforming our marriage?
Doesn't hurt. Fake news. Sad.
I don't see your point.
Well, I’ve been through the contract and there’s a major sticking point I’d like removed.
Police, I’d like to report a drive by republican.
Next time, could you just send a text?
Yes, you made your point and I think it finally stuck.
Yeah, I was just served a very pointed set of divorce papers. I’m looking for a lawyer who will have my back on this.
Looks like my divorce will be messy.
In retrospect, letting him just issue angry tweets to express his displeasure had its merits.
I don’t see your argument, but I get your point.
No, the back-stabbing bitch isn't here.
Was it really necessary to go behind my back with this?
Yes, I am sure she's serious about making the divorce stick this time
Your thank you note was deeply touching and heartfelt.
All she said was, she was sick and tired of my indulgences.
Well, I've looked in all the obvious places, but I can't see it. You sure you left a list?
He said something about ninety five thesis.
This time I think she means it.
I would like to cancel my subscription.
I have yet to read them but the divorce papers have arrived.
I hear her divorce lawyer is a Lutheran.
Martha just gave me a list of the things I do that annoy her.
I had to kill the messenger.
Yes, I recall when you said you had my back. I should have told you to forget it.
House Republicans? It's the middle class. Just wanted to let you know I got the tax reform bill. Thanks!
I literally can't see your reasoning.
I think you took the expression a bit too literally.
Her response to the suggestion of a pre-nup went as expected.
THEY STUCK IT TO ME WITH THE LATE FEES.
Hang on; my wife’s trying to get my attention.
No, I don't really know why she left - the note is a bit hard to read.
I would like to convert to the digital subscription please.
I take it your response is final?
No, I can't really read what it says!
The tag on this new shirt is killing me.
I received your last bill and it is literally killing me...
She's out right now but left me a note!
Yes....that's right.. divorce papers. And I think she's serious this time!
No, I'm not going to bend over backwards to read the fine print.
The rumors are correct. It is a hostile takeover.
No, I haven't read it yet.
I give up, honey. Where is it?
It's not like her to leave without telling me.
Honey...Yes I got your email, but I’m having a problem with the attachment.
Something you wrote really sticks with me.
It's not so much the pink slip, it's the fact he's such a drama queen
You could have told me to my face
That's it. I'm not representing any more Young Adult authors.
Yes Dear, I got the divorce papers
Honey, have you gotten back to me on that "to-do" list?
I'd love to grab a beer, but I have this Honey-Do list that feels pretty urgent.
I’m willing to negoiate.
It's not what you did, it's what you said that hurt.
Hello, I need to report a murder. Yes, I have all the forms filled out!
Yes, but she’s not in a mood to talk.
Your mother's letter arrived.
I think she wants a divorce.
"911, What's your emergency?
She called it a ' Honey Die" list.
The negotiations? Oh, fine. You know, some minor points, but nothing I can't handle.
Honey, you said the electricity bill was under the knife, but I can't find either of them.
I don't want to pick a quarrel but you chose a very rude courier service.
Well, she was always a devout Protestant.
...so then I said, ‘We communicate just fine!’
I thought there was a 5 day grace period?
Yes, Mom. It appears we're getting divorced.
No, she's not home, and quite frankly, I don't expect her to return.
Thank you for leaving the reminder note about our anniversary.
Hello, is this the Lutheran church? I'd like to file a complaint against one of your ministers.
No, I am not calling 911 to report that I was betrayed.
Et tu, Barbara?
I have this stabbing pain in my back, and I couldn't find it on WebMD so I called you, doctor.
I was just standing in a church doorway...
I told you that I cannot "state" my emergency. Someone will have to read it to me.
It appears that I have been served.
I'm not questioning that you served me, it's the method I object to.
Next time, could you just email me?
I've reformed.
I still haven’t seen the terms and conditions.
I finally got hold of his tax return.
Yes... Mr Kushner stopped by and said he's got my back in tomorrow's Senate hearing.
I'm calling about the "Early Contract Cancellation Penalties"?
I sense you want a divorce.
Honey, can you tell me again where you put the grocery list?
The new guaranteed message service is working but it is a bloody nuisance.
I have no idea where the contract is. I bet those backstabbers in the office are hiding it from me on purpose.
I got the message.
I did, but apparently the average tip is 20% now...
My wife is killing me with her "to do" lists.
Hi, I'm responding to the message you left earlier.
Apparently, someone else wanted to take a stab at my work.
I’m telling you, it’s not fake news
Trust me: it's still better than being on social media.
Working for Trump is tremendous! Fantastic!! Amazing!!!
Mary always uses my own words to stab me in the back.
Yes, I got the divorce papers.
B-R-U-T-U-S !!
The divorce papers? Yes, I just received them.
Yes, Vinnie, I have the contract right here.
Yeah, Doc, I've had this nagging pain ever since my wife served me with divorce papers
Yeah Doc, I have a whole list of back pains.
I think it's going to be a hostile takeover.
Sorry honey, I can't seem to find the shopping list.
Yes, Mr. Corleone, I did receive your to-do list.
So, Martin, Luther finally came by and turned in his thesis
Can I take that as a maybe?
Listen, about that urgent message you sent me...
You wouldn’t think a Luther 500 celebration would get so out of hand.
No, Marsha, I didn't see your note.
Yes dear. I got your 'to-do' list. It's just hard to read in mirror.
I can’t tell, are you going to publish my story or not?
I think there are some parts of the divorce settlement she is objecting to.
Oh yes, Gladys. But may I suggest that going through your divorce lawyer would have been a more adult way of doing it.
Sticks and Stones may break my bones, but it's that !#%?ing small print that kills me!
Yes, she definitely has some issues.
I'm not sure what her note says, but I don't think she's coming back.
Is it legal for my wife to serve me the divorce papers personally?
From the opening handshake to the parting slap on the back I found him to be an honest to God deal maker!
Can you please tell someone at the theology department that I've found a 96th thesis?
Take the kids to your mother's....I have a contract on me.
The board decided to give me my severance papers today
Oh, she signed them all right.
Where did you leave the 'honey-do' list?
Trust me, he'll stab you in the back the first chance he gets.
Honey, I found the “To Do” list!
As you suggested, doctor, we exchanged our respective lists of marital grievances.
I'd like to complain about your back bill posting policy.
Yes, my wife just served the papers...
Are you sure this is not covered under my health plan?
You could have just emailed the divorce papers.
If you've got something to say, at least have the guts to stab it to my face.
The details aren't important.
I paid last month’s cable bill on time but got stuck with a penalty for being late. I’m wondering if you could remove it.
Listen...I can't speak to the millions of crank calls you say you've received about this but I actually HAVE been stabbed in the back by the Republican tax bill and I need professional help immediately!
I got my wife to sign the divorce papers.
Can you make it quick? I'm in rehearsals for the Divorce-Attorney Association's production of Julius Caesar.
I'm pretty sure they're divorce papers.
You win. I will subscribe to the Sunday Times.
May I please speak with my attorney, I believe I've just been served divorce papers.
Even worse, she hired a Lutheran lawyer and he still has about 92 pages to deliver yet.
hold on...I appear to be getting an urgent message.
We were playing Martin Luther and the 95 theses.
Yes, dear. I found the want ads right where you left them.
The firing was a surprise, but I got a great reference.
Hi, just received a demand from the White House to drop the investigation.
So I take it you won’t be renewing your lease.
Trump delivered his message and this time it wasn't a Tweet.
I think I just got a very pointed text message.
Yes, I have my cellphone contract, but it is difficult to read, given where you put it.
Yes, your lawyer served the divorce papers. She is rather hostile.
At least they didn't throw me under the bus.
All I heard was, 'Hear ye, hear ye' - then he ran away.
Yes, I WOULD be interested in your 'Life Alert'!
I've been served.
My wife just filed for divorce. Could you send an ambulance?
Yes, I'm sure I was served with divorce papers.
No. Just ask him whether, hypothetically speaking, a subpoena delivered via dagger in a dark alley is a lawful means of service.
Yes, I agree, Chapeldoor is an unusual last name--ironic even, yes. Now, about that ambulance...
I'd say this 500 year commemoration of Martin Luther has gotten out of hand.
Uhm, yes. She gave me the divorce papers, but I haven’t been able to sign them yet.
Honey, where did you put the letter opener?
Kevlar T-shirt company? I'd like to file a complaint.
No, I still haven't seen your list of grievances.
Yes, I got the message, but I can't read it.
My wife turned out to be a real backstabber in this divorce.
She says that it's all explained in the note.
I got the divorce papers today...
I'm not sure. My unsigned divorce papers I'd guess.
Bringing up the prenup didn't go as badly as I thought it might.
So, is this what you meant about tax cuts to the middle class?
Remember Bob, our classmate with the "kick me" signs? He's a mob lawyer now.
Hi, I just wanted to verify, a divorce agreement with blood stains is valid?
The papers were served but I haven't had a chance to read them yet.
I was standing in front of Wittenberg Castle Church and this monk stabs me in the back with 95 Theses.... in Latin, no less....
Hello, Martin Luther? I think you have the wrong house.
Please tell Mr. Steinman that my wife would like to make some changes to the divorce offer
911 ? My emergency ? This subpoena is killing me.
Yes, Dear. I won’t forget to pick up the items on your grocery list.
I just got served with the divorce papers.
Hold on. I think Lois just let me know if I can go to Vegas with you, next weekend.
I calling to let you know I received the new Republican Tax plan and I wanted to express my distaste for it.
The divorce will be finalized once I get around to signing the papers.
It still feels like you stabbed me in the back.
Doctor, I just got my divorce papers but I need your help in retrieving them.
I just received your final notice.
I am telling you, I did not have a face to face meeting with the Russians.
Honey, where did you put those divorce papers?
I'm calling about the subpoena that was served on me today.
Um, Yes, Comcast? I'm ready to go paperless now.
I've been served with my walking papers.
Hello Congressman. I'm calling about your latest tax plan.
Honey, I have no idea where you put the grocery list.
...yes, well when they knocked on the door I suspected they were Jehovah's Witnesses. Turns out they were Lutheran after all.
Hi -- say, I've received my renewal notice from Healthcare.gov and I have a few questions.
I received the divorce papers.
I just told her, "I am sick and tired of seeing your "to do" list everywhere I go!"
Actually, I wanted the no-fault, no-pain divorce.
Yeah, I finally nailed the back story on POTUS.
Couldn't you have made your point in an email?
Yes dear, I know you've listed 95 problems with our marriage...but this last move seems a bit extreme.
911? Yes, I'll hold.
'Where did you put the shopping list?"
I have a bad feeling it's Trump's new tax plan.
Just got the divorce papers.
No, she didn't send a messenger, she delivered the divorce papers in person!
Mugged, yes. By lawyers. I believe it was a pack of lawyers.
Yes, my wife finally gave me the divorce papers to sign.
Yes, I did receive a copy of the proposed contract but I have not yet had a chance to read it.
You're not hearing me, Fred...I'm pretty sure she won't agree to the changes.
Could you come over and read her note to me?
She didn't respond that well to my asking for a pre-nup.
Yes, I got your message.
"Hello Sid, I think I've been subpoenaed by my ex-wife".
I'll need a mirror, but I'm pretty sure the divorce papers are now signed.
Yes, 95 theses, but it's the one knife that I'm worried about.
Look, Doris, I've looked everywhere for those divorce papers you dropped off, but...
Oh, I got the point.
I have a feeling that it's not good news.
I can't talk right now; I' ve got the law on my back!
She wants a divorce, I didn't see it coming. Yeah its pretty painful.
No, I'm pretty sure it won't be amicable. She's already served notice.
Does our plan cover marriage counseling?
I don't believe it's her "honey-do" list.
I haven't read it yet, but it just feels like an emergency.
I'd call it more than 'hen-pecked'.
Honey, I think it's time we paid the Chiropractor
Hi, I'd like to get caught up on my rent.
I've kind of gotten painfully attached to the manuscript.
Yes, dear, you’ve made your point about counseling.
Where exactly did you say you put it?
His name is Martin Luther.
Charlotte.... when you said you'd stick it to me, you hurt me deeply.
Hi Mark I think my Sharon just served me those divorce papers.
I can really feel the thrust of your argument.
These assembly instructions are not user-friendly.
Yes my wife has seen this morning’s Washington Post.
I think they are a little disappointed in my performance this year.
Well, the good news is I got a lot off my chest.
Nope, she just stormed out without saying a word.
Sorry Bob, the wife's To Do list trumps golf today.
Yes, I’ve been served.
I thought it was a Honey Do list but I'm thinking she had something else in mind.
My recent submission was painfully rejected.
I'm pretty sure my son Martin will not be attending the Catechism class.
Yes, she just served me with divorce papers.
A survey? Sure, I have time. Go ahead.
I haven't even read the thing yet and already I'm wounded.
I got your message. You get right to the point, don't you?
I told you, I can't read it! It's not like it's been nailed to my door!
Yeah, she left me but didn't take the good knife set.
No, they did not actually say they were rejecting my book.
That's right, officer. He said his name was Luther, then something about 95 theses and didn't have time to find a church door and had a plane to catch and would I mind? Can you send someone over right away? My back is killing me.
Please tell your lawyer that I got his subpoena.
No, I was expecting a poison pen letter.
Ya, my fiancée didn’t like the idea of a prenup.
I thought you said the divorce was going to be amicable.
Didn't hear you leave this morning. I'm fine, dear. What's up?
Yes, I understand that you are leaving me because you feel I'm dead inside, and no I have not seen any damn note!
I'm guessing they're divorce papers, but it's difficult to tell.
Divorce papers? How could I miss them?
My ex just sent me another letter.
I couldn't find your note. Where did you leave it?
I can't see you tonight. My back is hurting too much. Oh, and my wife found the letter you sent.
Yes I did get the divorce papers. The whole process has been very painful for me.
There's a sticking point in the Sanity Clause.
I’d like to report an assault with the English language.
Hello Amazon? I have some feedback on your new newspaper delivery system..
Yes doctor, I would describe it as a stabbing pain in my upper back.
Hold on, my wife has something to add.
Can I call you back? My wife just served me with divorce papers.
The gas company has gotten a lot more aggressive about their shut-off notices.
You forgot to tip the mailman.
...yes, I believe his name is Marin Luther...
I won't be in today, I've become painfully aware of some domestic needs I need to attend to.
Next time, just fax it.
She dropped off the divorce papers today.
The writing's a bit pedestrian, but the surprise ending was quite effective
I object to the way she served the divorce papers!
You're in luck. I think Dad wants to change his will.
I’d like to order a bulletin board please
Let me cut to the chase.
Yes officer, I agree that it was probably a contract killer, but why include the contract?
Hello...Mr. Luther...so when was your most recent eye exam?
Jenna, a simple “no” to not wanting to see me ever again would have been a better option.
So should I pick up some milk, too?
No doctor, I didn’t receive the bill, but the backpain is still there.
Hi honey, I can’t seem to find your “to do” list.
I think Post it notes was a better idea
"Hi, I'd like to re-schedule my marriage counseling appointment"!
Yes, Officer, I was just standing in front of the Wittenberg Castle church when...
She signed it.
Yes, she signed the papers.
Yes, the memo arrived, hand delivered. There is, however, a sticking point...
I hear they stuck a knife in the middle class tax cut.
I just got served.
No, I can’t get you my order number right now.
You know that back story you've been wanting me to find? It just hit me.
Glad you noticed. I'll change it from back to front.
Yeah, well as soon as I get to a mirror I'll tell you what the charges are.
No, she didn't like my suggestions.
My wife just filed the divorce papers.
I got the point but I don't see it.
You said you had my back!
Can you define "Pre - Existing" condition?
Despite the obvious, I don't see a point to your manifesto.
There's a message for you, but I can't read it.
You know hurts most? The legalese.
They left a ransom note, but I haven't read it yet.
Yes, I just received the divorce papers.
I'm telling you, no matter what it says, it was not suicide.
It's a killer script.
I just got the divorce papers and, in fairness, she once said she'd always have my back.
No, Brutus just left.
No, I can't stay on hold.
No, I can't read them, but I'm pretty sure they're divorce papers.
Can I call you back? My daughter just presented me with a dissenting opinion.
I don't know, Senator, I guess I just assumed that stabbing me in the back with taxes was a figure of speech...
Sorry I can't make it, I'm stuck with a huge "honey do" list.
I got the point of your message but couldn't you just email it?
No, honey, I haven't read your note yet, but I sense you are still cross with me.
I get the point of the contract, I just don't like how it was delivered.
“No, it’s a metaphor. A simile would use ‘like’ or ‘as’.
No thank you, I'm already stuck to my cable contract for the year.
She hit me with divorce papers.
But honey, you usually leave the list on the kitchen counter.
Flo just filed the divorce papers. I know, I know. I didn't see it coming, either.
My wife left me a note to call the doctor about stabbing pain that I've been experiencing.
Hello, this is the president of the co-op board; maybe we should reconsider that application.
I'm pretty sure he's not a real chiropractor
My wife says your early cancellation penalty is too severe.
And now I can't even read the damn 'to-do' list, so joke's on her!
Honey, where exactly did you pin up the to do list.
I think it was Martin Luther.
Tell me again what we need at the store?
I don't know why she's so angry. She left a long letter but I can't read it.
I'd like to file a complaint about your process server.
You might say it arrived by Fed-up Ex.
Yes...I think I’m finally persuaded to become a contributing circle member.
I would like to order a bulletin board and a box of thumbtacks for my wife.
Yes, I suggested he put his ideas down on paper.....
911? I need some help reading my wife’s alimony demands.
In this case, the Constitution doesn't protect me.
Sorry Dear, but can you do the shopping this week? I can’t find the list and my back is killing me!
Luther in Sales said he'd take a stab at it
A Post-it Note would have sufficed.
Yes, I did ask you to sharpen your delivery.
I decided not to insist on the prenup.
Sweetie, it appears you have forgotten to sign the prenup.
Honey, where did you say you left my list of chores?
Really, Marge? 'THESES?' Can't you just serve divorce papers like other wives?
To be honest Bill, I can't really recommend the "Immersive Julius Caesar"
No, I haven't read your script yet.
Believe me, there is no such thing as an amicable divorce.
Yes, I received your counter-offer!
You’re killing me with all this paper work.
Yes, I am "assuming" it's divorce papers--I can't see it, but...
My guess is he's a Roman, a Lutheran, or a mugger.
I was just informed that my wife filed for divorce.
Yes Dear, I have your note.
Well, I’m having a few stabbing pains but I think theyll subside once the contract is signed.
Well, of course it hurts.
Yes, I received the new Terms and Conditions
I just can't read your note.
I didn't get a good look, but I'm pretty sure he was a Lutheran.
Someone unfriended me!
I was hoping that your rejection notice would be a little less pointed.
Ok, Martha, you can have the still life.
Congress just passed tax reform.
I didn't understand the contract, so my wife took a stab at it.
Hello, front desk? - I've got a complaint about my bill...
I don't know where she is. She just left me a note.
Hold on, I just got your message.
Subpoena? ... I didn't get any subpoena.
Yes operator, we were playing charades. Where? In the library with the knife.
I just have a feeling this isn't the tax relief Trump promised.
I'm gonna be a little late.
What kind of knife wounds does my policy cover?
So, are we still on for tonight?
Yes dear, I finally feel your pain.
I'm telling you! She left without saying a word. Not even a note.
I'll call you back. Need to take care of a little paper cut.
Frankly Francine, I preferred the singing telegram.
Let me take a stab at it...you want a divorce....
Divorce papers? What divorce papers?
Yes, stop my service. A local cell provider has made me an offer I can't refuse.
She left a note.
Yes, I will not forget to go to the market today.
My backstabbing former partner is suing me.
My fiancée didn't like the Prenup ...
These new plans you’re sticking me with, they’re killing me.
I'd like to report a betrayal.
Yes dear, your subpoena was served..
You stab me in the back with a ransom note hand written in cursive and then you have the audacity to call me on my land line.
Take Trump at his word when he says, "I'll stick it to you!"
Larry, my wife just served me with divorce papers. What’s next?
. . Well, I was standing near the front of the church, and this guy comes up dressed like Martin Luther, . . . .
I'd be happy to take a message for you.
Does the company insurance policy cover backstabbing?
In fact, no, I can't read it to you right now.
Yes dear, I found the divorce papers.
I sense our divorce discussions have entered a new phase.
It's more of a stabbing pain that gets worse around quarterly review time.
I'm calling to let you know I received your message ...
I got their counter offer.
No, I can't read it, but I'm pretty sure it's a list of the ninety-five reasons she wants a divorce.
Honey, any quibbles with the prenup?
She presented her objections Luther style.
I have a feeling Marsha isn't going to sign the divorce papers.
Yeah 911, I’ll be needing an ambulance, but is it possible to stop by my lawyer’s office on the way to the hospital?
I understand you're a little upset, but what's for dinner?
Do process servers have any restrictions?
Yes, I'll renew my subscription.
Me too....but i just can't put my finger on it.
Yes Dear, I have tho ToDo list right here
You misunderstood. I said I'd like to change my delivery option to email not chain mail.
I just can't face the divorce papers she served me with!
I have a strong feeling that she wants a divorce.
No, I still don't see your point.
This isn't the type of pointed feedback I expected
"Hi Fiona, I've just got your letter".
Frankly, you're killing me here with your onerous terms.
Where's the shopping list?
The good news first honey. It finally appears my divorce is being granted.
911?, help! I was just received the Republicans tax reform bill!
Actually, it's more like 106 theses; and, no, she didn't nail them to the front door.
And where did you leave the note?
Honey, I have a feeling there's something you want to tell me,
I can't understand why you didn't get the payment. My wife figured out a surefire way to remind me to send our bills in on time.
Can't go out tonight, Larry. My wife is dead serious about this "honey-do" list.
She said it was important.
I wasn't being literal.
Can't you just do it on social media like everyone else, Myrtle?
Wait, what exactly did you mean by 'early termination fee'?
What message?
My wife says that I am in fact covered for stabbing back pain.
Yes, I got your note.
I just received my final notice so I need to speak to someone in your medical department.
I'd like to discuss my bill.
I just left the White House and my backs been aching ever since.
I'm going to have to disagree with these terms and conditions.
As a matter of fact, they were quite pointed with their concerns about our offer...
I take it, you didn't care for the pre nup?
Yes, I have a complaint about the new paperboy. No, no, his aim is excellent; that's not the problem.
She served me the divorce papers today.
I don't think he liked the changes.
It's just not my day. First, the 'Dear John' letter. Then she stabs me in the back.
Yes I received the divorce papers today dear.
Yes, I got the divorce papers from her.
I got your message.
Describe it? I would definitely say its a painful reminder.
I’ve got the divorce papers behind me
She finally got her point across.
Hi sweety..... yup, yup.... my wife did finally sign the divorce papers......but there's a small glitch.
OK, but Martin Luther posted them to the door.
Probably would have been better to leave my messages on the machine.
Mr. Mueller, I got the written confession from them that you wanted but not exactly as I expected. You may want to come see this.
Please take me off the distribution list.
Okay, I’m sorry I didn’t read your email.
I have no idea. I didn't see it coming, and she didn't even leave a note.
Hello 911? I've been attacked by Lutherans
I'd say it's more of a stabbing pain.
That's Luther, L-U-T-H-E-R
Sorry honey, I can't find your "to do" list.
Why do you always put my ‘honey-do’ list where I can’t find it?
YES DEAR I WAS FIRED- SOME BACK STABBERS AT THE OFFICE.
I guess she really isn't happy
It wasn't suicide, no matter what my wife tells you
I'm quite sure she already signed...
Yeah, I just got served. So you really want a divorce? Like, for real?
Hello, Wittenberg Cathedral?
Well, that's the problem, I have to take out the knife to get the account number.
She finally signed the divorce papers, but it doesn't look like I will get to keep the house.
What list?
I really think she means it this time!
Yes, apparently, I forgot to schedule her follow-up anger management session.
Hello? The new tax plan seems to have stabbed me in the back.
He said his name was Luther
For the last time, Margaret, you did not give me a shopping list before you left for work. And I’m getting pretty tired of you saying I don’t listen when you’re talking to me.
No, honey, I didn’t find your shopping list
I no longer expect an amicable divorce.
Next time just tie a string around my finger.
Honey, where's that shopping list you were on my back about?
You do know you can mail divorce papers, right?
Yes, they left a note. That's the problem.
So you left me and didn't even leave a note.
The stuck me with the hospital bill.
Does it count as "serving a summons" if they don't put it in my hands?
I haven't a clue.
'Yes, my wife just discovered my roaming charges."
The magnet on the fridge would have worked just as well.
" I don't think you understand. It's a little more serious than someone just talking behind my back....
Why didn't you just pick up the phone?
If you wanted a divorce, you could have just asked.
I'll be late for dinner, the paperwork is killing me.
Remember that list of suggestions I gave to Tom?
What backstabbing remarks?
Yes, this is a complaint on how I received the eviction notice.
tell Mon Senior that the Lutherans are at it again
Honey, I said I'd be happy to pick up the groceries but you forgot to leave me the list.
I'm calling about your new list of demands.
Well, the divorce is final, but Muriel took it a bit harder than I expected.
No, Leslie doesn't live here any more.
Mom, she gave me her terms for the divorce.
Does this mean the wedding is off?
Frankly, I am taking all the backstabbing at work very personally.
You cannot unilaterally revise the terms of our tontine, Gregory.
I’m sorry,...where’s the shopping list, again?
Barb, did you sign the prenup?
Yes, I'd like to report that my wife is missing, she left a note, but I'm going to need help reading it.
Yes. She gave me the divorce papers.
I've been stabbed in the back before, my friends.
I thought our divorce was supposed to be painless.
I'm calling to report a summons turned violent.
Thought you should know I just got served by my ex.
..and I also don't appreciate your tone.
Yes, I got your summons to appear.
Thanks for calling, it never occurred to me to look there
... and that's how she served the divorce papers...
Got your note - mind if we chat?
Duly noted. I'll put the Oxford comma back in.
What about telling me to my face?
She had some reservations about the prenup
Well no, he didn't like the return we prepared.
She says we need to communicate better.
Do you remember when you said that being president of the co-op board is a thankless position?
I want 2 egg rolls, fried rice and a surgeon.
Yes...she signed them. But the old 'take her to a fancy restaurant to avoid a scene' ploy failed miserably!
I had a feeling you left a note, but I didn’t see it.
No, honey, I didn't see the note you left while I was napping. Where did you leave it?
She's threatening to twist it if I keep the convertible.
Good news, Honey. I just received that Whitehouse job offer in writing.
As my divorce attorney, you should know that my wife served the papers for divorce just now!
She served me with divorce papers
You could have just emailed me my performance review.
I asked her for one example where I didn't listen.
In hindsight, biting the hand that fed you was preferable
I don’t know. When I woke up she was gone and so was my manuscript.
Yes, Dear, I promise I won't forget to sign the divorce papers.
Yes, I did get your message, but I'm having difficulty reading it.
Take this kids somewhere safe...there's a contract on me
I didn't get a good look, but I think he was a Lutheran.
Yes, I got the point of your message.
No, the pain has always been there, but this time it feels litigious
I didn't count them all,but she said it was 95 complaints.
Reporting an attempt to kill the messenger.
Of course I could tell you were upset, dear, but I still don't know why.
I got your note. But I'm having some difficulty reading it.
Good news. My boss is no longer a pain in the butt.
All right. I accept the Terms of Service.
Yes, boss, I got your note, in the usual place. Yes, of course I get the point.
To be honest, Billy, when it comes to being a victim of legalese, I'm having difficulty differentiating between literal and figurative.
Yes, I'm positive I chose paperless billing.
Hi babe, is there any chance we can talk about this?
It’s addressed to Dear Recipient.
You’ve always been a pain, but lower.
Honey, where did you put the grocery list?
Yes, I did receive your demand letter and quite frankly this follow up call is a little much.
Yes, he wrote me back.
Just because you didn't like the legal agreement I said you had to sign, you didn't have to become a backstabber.
Remind me again...where did you put the shopping list?
Those divorce papers I thought I'd lost...they just turned up.
All I said is, “What’s wrong with indulgences,” and then Martin goes off on me.
You're dumping me because I don't show my emotions?
Yes, it’s definitely a rejection letter.
I'm tellin' ya, nurse, I'm lookin' in the mirror and all I see is a potted plant.
I wouldn’t exactly call them cutting remarks.
Well...I finally told my wife about us.
I can't read it, but I'm pretty sure it says she wants a divorce!
Yes. Ms. Borden was already here to sign the contract.
I'd like to speak to your best divorce attorney, please.
I asked her to sign a pre-nup. I would say she didn't take it very well.
Alice, settle down. What do you mean when you say you went behind my back?
Yes, Dear. I won't forget the shopping list.
I need you to look at a contract.
Sorry, Sam, can't make lunch today. I'm stuck at home.
Honey, did you leave the chores list where I can find it?
You know, there were easier ways to tell me you want a divorce.
I can't play today. No, it isn't my tennis elbow.
And I thought having a "kick me" sign on my back was the worst it could get...
You know what hurts the most? No one told me I had a prenup stuck to my back all day.
What gave you the idea I've ignored your memos?
My boss sent me home with a note today.
We've just been served.
I haven't read it, but I'm sure it's not good.
My estranged wife, the circus knife-thrower, finally signed the divorce papers.
My wife left me, but I don't know why.
My wife served me with divorce papers.
I'd like to revise my opinion on Manuscript 5754: Idiot's Guide to Getting Published
Darling, where exactly did you put that letter from my mother?
Yes, Mr. TRUMP, I have received your message. Same as Gov. Christie and AG Sessions.
Yes, I too feel betrayed by the news!
My new job as poster boy is going well
It seems I agreed to compulsory arbitration
I received the divorce papers from your attorney today.
It's like a stab in the back
Yes, I'm seriously thinking about getting out of politics.
It seems my wife is ready for a Marital Reformation.
I know Dad. I’ve tried that. But, I still feel like I’m a target.
I've been subpoenaed to testify before congress.
Hi, I would like to order some Post It notes for my wife, the kind with the sticky paste on the edge
Yes, my back pain is back again and I can't find my insurance papers.
I'm not sure I'd call the divorce, "amicable".
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it. But I feel all of your concerns, especially the one about my not putting the toilette seat back down.
Hello, Find A Mate, I want my money back.
Hello Martin Luther? I think there's been a mistake.
9-1-1, I've been manifestoed.
I think I'm finally ready to give email a try.
Yea, I got it. Did you ever try using PostIt notes?
My wife gets less and less subtle each year about what she wants for her birthday.
The food was good, but I wasn't nuts about how they presented the check.
I've looked everywhere for the shopping list.
No, I asked for the MLK impersonator, not the Martin Luther impersonator.
'I'm sorry but I have to cancel the movers, Iv'e been stuck with my old rental agreement for another year."
Seriously. I won't forget.
The IRS is really getting tough with failure to pay on time!
Yes, I know I'm stuck with the fine print!
The Mrs. just served me with those divorce papers
Balding...German accent...accomplice called him Luther.
What do you mean this is just the first draft?
Well their initial offer was acceptable... but they added an amendment I can't refuse.
No, I haven't actually seen the note...but I'm fairly certain she wants a divorce.
I specifically told the man, "Post No Bills."
I’m finding it difficult to read the separation agreement.
Call me old school but a contract must cut both ways.
Hello, Mrs. Luther? Yes, I'm calling about your son Martin.
I need an ambulance and a lawyer.
Frankly, she didn't handle the divorce papers very well.
Yes, Martin, I got your point.
We weren't exactly happy, but I can't say I saw this coming.
No, I’ve been extremely served.
It's not the fine print that gets you.
Where did you say you put the divorce papers?
Am I feeling listless? No, not exactly.
Just to be clear - you have practiced pirate law before?
Next time just hand them to me.
I got your letter and it really hurt.
All I heard when she went out the door was “and here’s your damn pre-nup”. It felt like a stab in the back.
Your attorney just served me with divorce papers...would he happen to be Lutheran, per chance?
"Yes, I got your note, I guess things haven't changed"!?
The insurance company said they would be on my side, not on my back.
Saul, I'm being sued by Brutus, too.
Your aggressive advertising for the Caesar salad has me intrigued.
She wants a divorce.
My God Doctor, my wife's Lasik surgery has failed.
Yes Doctor... My wife has her Martin Luther delusion back.
Well no, I haven’t read it yet, but it SEEMS like an emergency ...
I have a few problems with your chapter about our marriage.
9-1-1, my name is William. Can you please send someone? My wife just tried to execute her will.
Yes, I get the point. The check is in the mail.
Isn't it customary for a process server and not your client to deliver the divorce papers?
What message?
Wikileaks evidently has a new way to release information.
Tell my attorney I’m calling about the prenup.
No, I don't think to say "getting this letter is a stab in the back" is exaggerating.
Hello, Martin? Martin Luther?
Hello. I would like to answer, what is black and white and red all over.
I am calling to report attempted reformation.
No, I didn't get your message.
The hospital said I would experience some back pain when bill came.
Yes, I am a middle class taxpayer.
Can you call me back?
I sorry Mr. President I can't sign this well-worded resignation but it's definitely not because I don't want to.
Sorry, not tonight . . . I’ve got 95 theses to read.
9-1-1? "I'd like to report that some idiot thinks backstabbing is covered by the 2nd Amendment.
Next time email will be just fine.
I got your first note. Should I expect any follow-up?
I vaguely recall you mentioning a list while I was watching the game.
A simple pink slip would have been sufficient.
Yes, I want a divorce too, but how do you expect me to sign the damn thing.
I think she really means it this time.
It's actually quite refreshing considering all of the front stabbers we've had this year.
I'm beginning to think she was serious about the divorce.
She left a note. It feels like a stab in the back.
Et tu, Doris. You couldn't just leave an ordinary Dear John letter, like anyone else, could you?
He said something about being related to Martin Luther.
Yes, she delivered the divorce papers herself.
Tell me again where you put the shopping list.
No, their forms are NOT a pain in the neck.
I know you were raised as a Lutheran, but couldn't you just stuck your complaints on the door.
Hello, AT&T, yes, I think I'd like to change my Contract. Do you have something a little less painful?
She said that the five hundredth anniversary of Martin Luther's Reformation gave her the idea.
The Pre-nup ? Not a good idea.
Do you think I should watch my back?
I'm overreacting?? Well, I'm sorry, but that's exactly the way these divorce papers make feel.
No, I really didn't see that coming.
You said to call as soon as I got the divorce papers.
Well dear, tell your lawyer that I'm having a problem reading the fine print...
These latest demands from her feel like a knife in the back.
Yes they have a list of demands and Yes I think they mean business.
I think I got the point
I would like to report a Coup!
My wife just delivered our divorce papers.
I'm dealing with more Fake News than you can throw a knife at, really.
Yes, as a matter of fact, she personally delivered the property settlement papers.
Is it because I still depend on a land line?
I'd like to leave a voice message for Marcus Junius Brutus please.
Her therapist is a strict Lutheran.
This is your editor returning your message.
Okay, okay, you told me not to marry a Lutheran!
Yes. I'm quite sure this is my last Will
Yes, I received your message.
'Is it an emergency?' "I don't know, I can't read it?"
I really think I got the job this time. It felt like I nailed it.
This Thanksgiving your mother has a few rules for the conversations we can have at the dinner table.
Loud and clear, Bonnie. You get the ficus and the juicer.
Don't ignore his emails.
"What note"?
So she gives me the divorce papers but really, how does she expect me to sign them?
I'm requesting the delivery to put on my doorstep from now on.
Honey, I can't find the list you left me...
I haven't gotten around to reading it, but she didn't bother with a process server.
I would say it's more like a honey die list.
Hello 911? I'd like to report a Fake News attack!
Yes, I definitely got your point as I was leaving.
Well, next time write it backwards, so at least I can read it in the mirror.
I told him there was no way they were going to pin it on me!
Oh, and by the way, please stop sticking your menus everywhere.
I have a complaint about the newspaper delivery person.
Can I call you back? Someone just left me a message.
Ok.. you made your point...
Hold on, I just received a text from my smartknife.
You’re not going to stick me with another two year contract again, are you?
No, I haven't seen the divorce papers yet.
He was supposed to nail it to the door, right?
911? You see, I had just finished explaining the phrase stick it to me to my toddler...
They just delivered our middle income tax reform package
I feel like there’s something I’m supposed to remember.
Apparently, the 'terms and conditions' state that I can only refer to them as "the assailant".
That’s not the half of it; they charged me with carrying a concealed weapon.
No, she didn't tell me in so many words.
Honey, have you seen my last will and testament?
'My back is killing me!' is not a pre-existing condition.
Take a stab at the reviews in the back.
Hello, Mr Luther, this is Bob from 1517. Yes, your son Marty has been at it again.
Yes, honey, I ordered more post-it's.
I signed a couple bad contracts and now they won't get off my back!
Yes? Hello? I'd like to complain about the newspaper delivery.
While I'm not sure I can sign it, their lawyer did make a compelling point.
Was she miffed? Yes, I think we can say "miffed" would apply.
Hi, I’m calling to return all 95 of your messages
Well, she did point out that she won't miss me.
I need an ambulance and a lawyer.
...and on top of everything else, she's a Lutheran now, too.
Yes, I'd like to make a complaint about how I'm being served.
Boy, am I ever sorry I voted for Trump!
The fake news is starting to feel real to me.
I'd like to speak with Martin Luther's supervisor please.
Sure, I'll give you the shirt off my back. Over my dead body.
I have to say that your last letter has really stuck with me.
Just a pain in my back and a lost chores list.
The bed in this suite is very uncomfortable.
I think she means it this time - she won't answer my emails.
Ellen walked out on me again. This time she didn’t even leave a note.
Yes, Doctor, my wife is a Lutheran. Why do you ask?
No, Mom, she didn't sign the prenup.
So she found out she only gets the house...
Yes, I got her sign the pre-nup.
Yes, it's a fair contract, but there's one sticking point.
I can't today Phil; my wife has given me a honey-do list
No, the reconciliation isn’t going well.
I just got your text.
I don't know. It could be a honey-do list or divorce papers.
Yes. I found the grocery list, Helen.
It doesn't feel like a subpoena. I think it's the Ten Commandments.
I asked Marge to put it in writing.
I still haven't received your list of demands.
I haven't had a chance to read the fine print.
Yeah, the guy playing Luther took it really seriously.
Just a bit of advice ...."watch your back."
I can't find the list you left and the pain in my back still hasn't gone away.
Not really an ache...More of a sharp manifesto.
Hello, Mary? Please leave your message on the machine next time.
So I can assume you won't be coming home tonight dear?
The proposal was rejected.
Yes, Luther. L-U-T-H-E-R.
She gave me some divorce papers so I think she's on to us.
Hello, New Yorker magazine, I have a copy of the latest GOP tax bill.
No, not tattoo removal.
Well, I think they're pretty strict Terms and Conditions.
Yes, I'm certain they are divorce papers.
Et tu, Telemarketer?
She's gone, and something tells me she won't be back.
In the future, I'd really appreciate it if you just left me a voicemail message.
Well, the chef begs to differ and I think he makes a very, strong point.
``I can't find the prenup anywhere.''
I'd like to report a hate rhyme
Honey, I'm telling you, I've looked everywhere and I can't find this "To Do List" you say you've left for me.
Yes, and I don’t think she’s happy with it.
It's that age old dilemma .. I never know whether to take it figuratively .. or literally.
Yes, I have a complaint about your delivery service.
Yes, I suppose it is ironic that she called the prenup a betrayal.
I would be interested, but I really can't pull out of my current contract.
Why, yes -- I did get the divorce papers from your lawyer today.
Honey, I can't find your shopping list anywhere!
I have a problem with your user agreement.
Gotta go.
And then the second my back was turned...
I have this nagging feeling they didn't like our offer.
I think it's a list of her complaints.
My "To Do List" is killing me.
I'd prefer not to take another message.
Yes, sir.....I see sir. I agree it may have gone better with you here......no, I am quite certain I know the precise moment that contract negations broke down...
Wait a minute, she left a note around here somewhere.
It's about the cable bill, I need to change delivery.
Yes, my wife’s lawyer just delivered a copy of the divorce papers.
HR Department please, it's about the termination letter.
I don’t know. Who do you think yours is from?
Her divorce lawyer is evidently Lutheran.
No, officer. I don't mean it as a metaphor!
I haven't yet read the accompanying letter, but is it reasonable to surmise that I won't be getting a second interview?
Well Mom, she finally did it -- She served me with divorce papers...
So, long story short, we’re going through quite the Reformation in our relationship right now.
My wife just got back to me.
If you don't want to sign the prenup, you just should have said so!
A poison pen letter would have been enough...
My editor wants me to take another stab at it.
Thanks for the heads up, but my wife just delivered the divorce papers. .
I don't like being a target of fake news.
I don’t know why she keeps saying I’m clueless about feelings
I know you have a long list of complaints but if you don't come back, who's going to get the stain out of my shirt?
Are you sure? Because billing just told me to talk to you about this
"She served the papers right after the pot roast".
Nana finally signed her will
We are processing back orders now.
Hello Stan? Yes, I just got it, and no, Claire delivered it herself.
Yes, I got the point of your message.
No I didn't see your note. Where did you leave it?
Divorce papers? What divorce papers?
She keeps complaining that I'm impenetrable.
A petition demanding my resignation? No, haven't seen a thing.
This bill is a stab in the back.
Honey, I can't find the divorce papers
Work is going about the same as always.
I've just been served the divorce papers.
Mr Luther, please?
Are you sure you remembered to tip the paperboy?
Can I help you?" "Yes you can". "How do I get the IRS off my back?". "And please do not transfer me again!
Yes, hello, you said to call you back after I was served with the divorce papers.
Yes, she just served me with divorce papers, but I've been unable to read them.
I’m telling you, all I said was remove the crust and cut it into quarters!
I got your pointed message.
I'm sure it doesn't say "Kick Me".
Sorry honey, but I can't really find your shopping list. Where is it?
I've been reminded to make a reservation for Shakespeare's Julius Cesar
She left some divorce papers for me to sign.
Is it too late to cancel that reservation?
No. I can't read to you.
Well , Detective, it started off with a simple "kick me"...
Except for a few, minor hitches, she took the news rather well.
No, your daughter has been expressing her feelings quite clearly lately
Yes sir, I did receive the notice about cutbacks.
Rejecting my submission?! Talk about adding insult to injury!
I don't have to read it to know she was mad as hell.
Your wife isn't ready to settle yet.
When I asked for a pointed reply, this wasn't what I expected.
My wife doesn't want to remortgage.
It’s what we get for raising him Lutheran.
We will give fair consideration to your application, but you will not be given any preference over those who submitted electronically.
Yeah, I think his name is Luther.
This tax plan feels like a knife in the back, but they say it will trickle down in our pockets
Sorry, I don't know where my wife put it.
I would like to cancel my subscription to Threats Weekly.
My wife thinks she's the next Martin Luther.
Luther, the company's policy is to post your ideas on the message board.
Yes dear I got your shopping list.
Trolling on Facebook would suffice
Hi Gene, we're not coming to counseling this week. For the first time in a long while I saw my wife and got a little tingle in my spine so I'm going to see where this goes.
I wish to report an illegal posting of a political campaign poster.
I have to say again, Mildred, naming him Martin Luther was a really bad idea.
She left me a message, but I can't read it.
Where did you leave the divorce papers you want me to sign?
There's a lot of backstabbing in the print media.
hello, 911? yes, i can hold.
Is that one-bedroom still available?
Honey....where did you put the shopping list??
Is that your final offer?
Yes, I think that I need a divorce attorney. My wife just nailed 95 thesis to my back.
Hi honey! Yes, the paperwork is right where you left it
Yes, she left a note but I haven't read it yet.
Sticky notes shouldn't hurt, should they?
...yes, I believe I’ve been served.
Honey, I just received a copy of the Republican tax reform bill.
The bill from the chiropractor came in. It didn’t make a difference.
So I said, "Let's just take a stab at working out our divorce settlement," and she . . .
Yes, Mr President, I feel I'm well qualified.
My wife just served me with divorce papers.
No, Luther is not here and yes, he did leave his grievances with me.
If you don't pick up the phone I'm dead.
Hi, it's me. I got your message.
Ma? Have you converted my bedroom yet?
I haven't seen it. Was it a text or an email?
The contract has one big sticking point.
Oh, and I suppose because I didn't read your letter that now I'm "unfeeling."
I got your point. I prefer Twitter.
Yes, I'm aware my account is overdue. Your representative was just here to inquire about it.
Hello, I am just calling to confirm that I have received your message
Maybe you're right, Bob. I should have seen this coming.
Okay, so you didn't like the script. You could have just mailed it back.
I can't play cards tonight, I'm stuck with a 'to do' list
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the list of demands that they left behind my back.
9-1-1? Yes, I'd like to report that I received an attack ad through the mail.
I don't think she appreciated that article on self-improvement I gave her.
I can't remember exactly, I stuck it somewhere.
Honey, remember that argument I had with the mail carrier?
I received your final notice.
I just received my new policy and I have a question about the deductible.
Yes, Monsignor, we have evidence that Martin Luther is back.
Well I did tell her I didn't like text messages.
For once could you just leave the shopping list someplace I can find it?
I have the answer to our law suit.
As soon as I find a mirror--and master right to left , you'll get your darn report.
Yes, I received it, but I'm having a hard time reading it.
I am sorry Pamela, but that is no the way to serve a divorce notice
I received the documents from my wife. I don't believe that this will be settled amicably.
I know I'm not supposed to call you, but I can't find our divorce papers.
It was a stab and run, but they left all their insurance information.
Sorry, I can't take any more messages.
Yeah, my wife just had divorce papers served. Can you send an ambulance?
Well does the doctor have any time free next week?
Yes, she left me the divorce papers to sign.
The new tax forms arrived.
No officer, I don't know the subject of the document.
The Drug Facts info for my painkiller - honey, where'd you stick that?
...then he mumbled something about indulgences and asked me if I had any Pepto.
Tell the president that I got his return tweet!
Tell him that all submissions must go through proper channels.
Yes, she served the divorce papers today.
No, I cannot read what is on the paper.
No, I'm tired of reading her notes in the mirror. I need you over here.
Did you leave it somewhere I could find it?
Today’s news is killing me.
Given how the divorce papers were served, Emily, I guess there's no chance of reconciliation.
Couldn't have just sent an email?
I'm pretty sure she stuck me with they're divorce papers.
Yes, I need to hire a new Administrative Assistant.
Just because I clicked "agree" instead of reading the Terms and Conditions, doesn't mean that it's okay for you to stab me in the back.
Honey, have you seen the grocery list?
And we agree that when I take it out it becomes a legally enforceable blood pact.
It's apparently true... I'd make a better door than a window.
She ALWAYS has the last word.
Honey, I can't find your to-do list.
She finally signed the divorce papers but I'm left with this stabbing pain.
Where did you put my honey-do list?
My troubles are behind me.
No . . . it's a little higher up and more to the left . . .
I think someone has put out a contract on me.
My Congressman just gave me a copy of the new tax bill.
I need to speak to my attorney, please. It appears my wife has posted 95 reasons why she wants a divorce.
Hold on. I think I just got served with divorce papers.
Yes, I got the invitation to my funeral.
Yes, I saw the doctor about my back pain...he said it's too long to explain...
I haven't read it but I'm assuming she wants a divorce.
She really drove in the knife with these divorce papers.
Yes, I know we agreed the title would be "Death Surprised Me" and I feel the ending is becoming clearer.
This is clearly not what I expected when I suggested he took a stab at his homework.
Protestant.
I Agree
She said she was glad to see the back of me.
Now, we both know nobody enjoys a good "KICK ME" sign more than I do, but I wish you'd found another way to attach it.
She's really sore. But reading her complaint in the bathroom mirror, I'd say she's got it all backwards.
She really stuck it to me.
It's always the fine print that gets you.
The backbiting has stopped. Now it's escalated to backstabbing ultimatums!
She took the divorce papers surprisingly well.
I ran into Martin Luther today.
I’ve been having trouble sleeping on my back.
No, literally. He literally stabbed me in the back, through a copy of the Constitution for some reason.
Do you give credit for back payment?
Are you serious about wanting to break up?
Yes, I just got s copy of the new GOP tax plan!
Where did you find that divorce lawyer?
I know, but still, I never received the email confirmation.
Yes, the President just hired me personally.
Ironically its a paring knife.
Yeah, the tax plan is a bust, but at least GOP backstabs are covered under the ACA.
Yes, I'm sure I'd rather get the paper online.
My wife has some questions about the will you drafted.
Frank, can we move our tee-time? My honey-do list is a bit longer than I thought.
Please tell Mr. Luther that his theses was delivered to the wrong address.
I forgot another anniversary.
Don't shoot the messenger?
I know you think I'm an unfeeling ,insensitive, cold shoulder kind of guy,but can we get together at the ER and talk about it?
Remember how in the last session, you told her she needed express herself unreservedly?
Nah, she always does this whenever I forget her birthday.
I think we overplayed our hand a bit with that ultimatum.
Apparently the new generation of internet trolls is neither anonymous nor terse.
I’m getting a painful feeling your serious about this divorce.
Martin? You just missed him.
Honey, do you remember where you put the dagger remover?
Just a hunch, but I think Bob Mueller wants to ask me some questions.
Well, I still haven't read it, but now I know where he was coming from.
Front desk...Couldn't you have just slipped the bill under the door?
This is what gives class action lawsuits a bad name.
I haven't read it yet, but it still hurts.
Well, officer, the knife is real, although the news may be fake.
Fine, I'll hold.
Meryl served me the papers today so I guess she's serious about going through with the divorce.
Yes, I received the letter from your attorney. I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
She did it. She finally signed the divorced papers.
Yes, she just had me served with the divorce papers.
We are not currently interested in a romantic getaway.
Honey, I just located the Honeydo list.
Dr. Luther, even though it is the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, I would appreciate it if you used more traditional methods of communication.
It only hurts when I laugh.
Yes, you can say that I have been served.
I can't believe she took her final stab at filing for divorce today!
Yes, dear. I got your honey do list.
Yes, my last name is Wittenberg, but you're delivery is 500 years late...
I tried to tell her that I was only the messenger!
The 'Dear John' I can accept, it's the delivery I have issue with....
I lost the acupuncture forms again.
Officer, I want to report a threat. It's in da Vinci mirror code.
Never mind insensitive! Where did you leave our divorce papers?
I was hoping we could settle this amicably.
I’m just saying there’s got to be a better way to serve divorce papers.
911? This is the middle class. We'd like to report an attempted homicide called the GOP tax plan.
The divorce lawyer just dropped off my copy.
Your lawyer was here.
That's some sharp feedback for sure!
All I can tell you is that I'm picking up a really weird vibe at work.
Yes, I had called earlier about a missing newspaper.
I told her our argument was pointless but she proved me wrong.
I'd love to move but I can't get out of my lease.
My new neighbor is a Lutheran.
I can’t make it. Apparently something needs my attention.
I'd like to complain about your company's bill collector.
Lost the grocery list again. Do we need frozen waffles?
Et tu, Wells Fargo?
Mom, you may be hearing that I am not working in the West Wing anymore.
I'd like to have a word with Mr. Luther, please.
Something tells me I've put off the 'honey do' list a bit too long...
Honey, I just received my job evaluation and I don't think I will be home tonight.
I think it’s that explanation of benefits that I asked for...
Yeah, the contract took some sharp criticism....
Martin was here and he's pretty angry.
Mum, can we please have less of the 'But she's Lutheran, I knew it would come to this' talk...
It started when I gave him ‘a punch list.’
"She just left without even leaving a note".
I think my wife is trying to tell me something.
She wants a divorce.
I just heard back from your attorney.
I get the feeling she's trying to send me a message.
I know, Mr. Shapiro, she was just here....
This 'Honey-Do' list is brutal.
She did let me have her great-grandpa's hunting knife.
I know the wedding is next week, mom, but she's indicated she has some problems with the prenup.
some one is trying to tell me something
Excuse me for a moment. I think I just received another message.
I know she left me a list somewhere.
I’d like to sign up for electronic delivery of my account documents in the future.
I can't sign the settlement papers if I don't know where you put them, Joan.
Honey, where did you put the to do list?
As a matter of fact, I did just receive the divorce papers, Gladys.
I’m pretty sure it’s the pre-nup.
I don't know, I can't read it.
I've received their hostile takeover offer.
I think someone's trying to tell me something.
The ultimatum my wife just gave sure does sting.
Yes Doris, your divorce papers did come through.
It feels serious.
Message received.
Mother was here, she left a note.
Now where did she put the divorce papers again?
My wife is gonna kill me if I don't work on that list, but I can't find it!
Correct. I’d like to repay my student loans please.
I'm not sure but she said something about divorce papers.
Francis, I want to report a Martin Luther sighting.
Sure I feel betrayed, but at least it's all behind me now.
Let me guess. You're mad I get to keep the painting.
Honey, did you say something about a to-do list before you left?
Hello Maddie. I'm calling to let you know I received the divorce papers.
Hello 911? My son seems to be in a Martin Luther phase.
Yes, I received the message.
Ok, I get the message
"Hi mom, just keeping you up to date, I received my divorce papers today"!
Yes, I got the message, but I can't read it.
I think the divorce attorney came by today.
Yes so the divorce is final. Signatures have dried.
I'd like to report a complaint regarding my delivery.
Honestly, I’m feeling rather upbeat now that I’ve put all that hate mail behind me.
All that talk about a kinder and gentler IRS? Not so much.
She told me she has my back.
Apparently there are 99 of them.
Brutus no longer lives here.
Well, it's a little skin off my back.
The column you wrote was quite sharp.
I think I have had it with being Attorney General.
Get off my back!
This is your idea of amicable?
Spencer is in his Martin Luther phase.
No I didn't misdial 911. She literally filed me with divorce papers behind my back.
I know, Reggie, but only exceptional MBA students in the management curriculum learn this after only two weeks. Impressive.
Sorry to be so annoying, but I have a sharp pain in my back - so I won't make it to work. I have a note from my therapist.
I just got sued by my back-stabbing partner.
The stabbing pain is my body sending me a message? I don't see it.
No Evelyn, I haven't gotten around to reading your list of demands yet.
I'd say it's time to take her concerns more seriously.
Hello 911? I've been stabbed in the back again. Yes, I work in advertising.
They said this is how they execute a contract over here.
Yes, Google? I'm calling to complain about your new service, 'DirkMail.'
Is your grocery store still open? My wife has a list of items she wanted me to pick up.
We've been working on our costumes for the Reformation 500 Anniversary party. Cathy is going as Martin Luther--I'm trying on the 95 theses right now.
It's sort of a sharp, stabbing pain.
I didn't actually see the courier, but I know he was here.
Thanks, but I already got her message.
And in another ironic twist of fate, guess how they delivered my hospital bill?
Ok, for the last time, I've received no such summons, now get of of my back!
I've been stabbed in the back before but never with a list of reasons
I think it may be some kind of cease and desist order but I haven’t been able to get to it.
No, I don't know why yet, but I'm pretty sure it's over.
I don't know if it's in all caps.
I never imagined that being served the divorce papers would hurt this much.
Yes, Mr. Luther was here, and left his theses.
Got your message. You seem to be unhappy with my counteroffer on alimony.
That article was a real stab in the back.
I'm not sure we should still use the same attorney.
Just switch me to the electronic version of your newsletter !
I've got a funny feeling she knows something's up.
I realize I complained about your food once, but I would still prefer to receive the weekly menu by fax only.
I need your help with a Post It Note my wife left me.
She is definitely serious. I haven't been able to read them yet, but she says they are non-negotiable .
I got your note. What's up?
Her mother just delivered the divorce papers.
Hold on. I think my wife is trying to tell me something.
Honey, where did you say you put that to-do list you left for me?
We have spirited religious debates. I’m Catholic and Linda’s Lutheran.
Ok, I'll call you when the phone company gets off my back.
How do I know he wants a divorce? I just... have a feeling.
They said thats all behind me now.
I’m taking notes.
She made her point.
I think I have been served with divorce papers.
"Hello Doctor, I have a pain in my back and I think it's trying to tell me something.'
I've been asked to join the reformation.
I can see that you’ve taken all your things, but I can’t seem to find the note you keep telling me you left.
Yes, she's calling it her '22 Theses,' for each year of our marriage.
911? Joe Taxpayer here. Just got stabbed in the back with the GOP tax plan.....
Man, my back is killing me.
I've got a stabbing pain in my back. And a long list of other symptoms.
911? I've been attacked by my health insurance provider.
My wife. Don't ask, I just know.
Uhh, no dear, I haven't seen it. You said you stuck it, where??
I wish she had just emailed the divorce papers.
I thought Dear John letters were typically left on the kitchen counter.
Hello, Fingers? You know how I said they'll never pin it on me?
Your process server was very insistent that I call immediately.
Thanks for getting back to me
No, I'd not be willing to take a brief survey after this call.
I'm dying to read your ultimatum!
Well it all started when I refused to sign the divorce papers...
Sorry, I can't golf today. I've gotten my wife's to-do list.
I have a complaint about the recent delivery of my order for a back issue.
I didn't realize our marriage needed a Protestant reformation.
OK, I got your point.
Yes, I've got your message, could you please use my email next time
Yes, I did show her the prenuptial agreement.
Could you please reconnect me with the whistleblower hotline?
No Doc, I think she really means it this time!
I am sure I get the point of the memo
Good, so you received our friendly reminder.
Her divorce request was painful in so many ways.
I turned my back for a moment and she was gone but she left a note
Yes, of course I got your list of demands.
Ya. I got it. But, unfortunately for you, it looks like you hit "reply all."
I take it then that it is over between us.
My boss made sure I got the point to bring some work home today.
I just received the divorce papers.
It feels like there's a hole in the contract.
Fake news hurts.
Doctor Stevens, thank you for the procedure and I received the bill, but the back pain is persistent.
Scaramucci lied! He is a back stabber!
Well, it's not exactly a friendly divorce if you must know.
She filed yesterday, but it still hasn't sunk in.
I need to go now and call my shrink. This poison pen letter is killing me!
I think this makes me the Party of the Second Part.
For once in my life I can't hold.
I've received half my order and the invoice, but I'm still waiting on the cloak.
Your mother-in-law left a message.
YES, I KNOW YOU HAVE MY BACK
Yes I'm sure it's more than a harmless "KICK ME" Post-It note.
My vote for Trump was predicated on a middle-class tax cut.
I would describe it as a stabbing pain in my back.
yes sir...I did receive my prepared statement for the Congressional Hearing today.
No, nothing in the tax plan gives me an unfavorable opinion of the President.
I'm guessing it will be a painful divorce.
Is it too late to opt for paperless checkout?
No, I didn't read the fine print.
I received your notice but I am having trouble reading it.
Based on the weight, I'm guessing it's around six pages.
Yes dear, I know you wrote down a 'honey do' list, but I seem to have misplaced it.
No, on the contrary, we're going to renew our vows.
When I joined, you told me I was set-up for paperless billing.
She took almost everything, and I can't find the divorce papers anywhere.
Senator, I just want to thank you for the tax cuts.
I've put all that behind me.
No, I don't have my account number handy at the moment.
He says I was given a full explanation in writing but I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen the note but it feels like a betrayal.
Yeah I got the divorce papers; it's my fault for marrying a reformation historian in the first place.
It may be fake news, but it's making an impression on me.
Apparently, she's accused me of being unfeeling.
I feel like she's trying to tell me something.
When I sexted her I had no idea she was a pirate and a lawyer.
So I told her, 'Just go ahead and take a stab at making those divorce allegations stick.'
On second thought, I’ll sign up for e-billing.
I'd like to report a manifesto...
...and you ruined my favorite shirt.
I know I promised to change my will, dear, but your reminders are getting a bit extreme.
I've been hacked.
Its not so much that they're talking behind my back ...
I keep having these paranoid thoughts.
She did make one point in her favor.
911? My wife seems to be missing and I also need help for a sharp pain I've had since this morning.
Yes, dear. The divorce papers have been served.
Hello, Wittenberg Castle church?
I don’t know what their demands are. They were pretty angry and I don’t have a three-way mirror.
No, Doc, the pain is no longer in my neck.
Fine, I'll read your manuscript!
No, I can’t read the ransom note!
My wife is missing, and yes, she left a note, but I can't read it.
Can someone in your practice represent me? I was just served with a divorce warrant.
Et tu, Donald?
I can't seem to find it anywhere.
Can you help me? I forgot where my wife put the directions.
'Somehow I don't think this is the step toward better communication our therapist had in mind.'
I think it's divorce papers but I can't read upside down.
I'm letting my lawyer handle it.
Then she muttered something about her 95 Theses.
Shall I assume you won't be making dinner tonight?
Where did you leave the divorce agreement?
They got back to me
How did you send it?
You know, it's a pain to keep checking your lists of things for me to do."
You could have just tweeted your Dear John letter
I get the point!
So your editorial judgement is no longer rewrite and resubmit?
Yes, I got the message. I'll vote for Moore.
So, you're saying we're getting a divorce?
I think she could have just as easily handed it to me.
It's been brought to my attention that I'm late paying my cable bill.
So.... uhm, I got your final notice....
I'm serious -- all this paperwork is killing me.
Yes, I'm Martin J. Luther, the great great great great great great grandson of THE Martin Luther and I want to speak to to someone at the Vatican! NOW!!
Hello, Washington Post
I thought you had my back
...ok, now picture Martin Luther
Are you sure you really feel this way?
I didn't get a chance to read it.
Being let go after all these years was like a knife in the back
I think I could have been a little more diplomatic.
It seems my wife has come to an agreement on our divorce issues.
Hello, I have a complaint about Stab-o-Grams.
You really want us to end on a stuck note?
Wait, my wife just sent me a message.
It appears I've misplaced the draft of our prenup.
The papers were served and I feel like I got stabbed in the back.
So you're saying I've been served?
She said I needed to reform; then she posted her 95 reasons.
I haven't seen the bill yet, but I'm not looking forward to it.
Do you do take out?
I prefer tracked changes.
They just barged in and said, 'This is from Vlad.' Then I said, 'Putin or the Impaler?'
I have the divorce papers right here.
Honey, I can't do the grocery shopping: my back is killing me.
Help, I'm a victim of Protestantism.
“I think she just filed for divorce”.
No, I can't find the newspaper... But my back hurts.
I think it’s something I picked up at the office.
Well...it was certainly pointed response.
I don't think that she's willing to sign the NDA.
This mnemonic device is too painful to use.
The divorce is final.
Yes, well, at least they listed their grievances this time.
I'm trying to reach my wife, Edict.
I know you think I'm forgetful and insensitive, but I can't find your 'honeydew' list.
Yes, Vivian, I received the divorce papers this morning.
No I can't count them, but I am pretty sure it was Martin Luther.
Yes, Louise, as a matter of fact, your attorney DID serve me with the divorce papers.
I don't know what it is, but I'm feeling like someone is targeting me.
Yes, I’ve been served.
I wish you'd called first instead of leaving the note.
Next time send your demands via email, please.
It would seem I'm a part of a much larger plot.
it's me again, I can't believe you didn't even leave a farewell note
Yes, I picked up your new iPhone. Though I don't think you'll like the terms of service agreement.
i was explaining mansplaining to her and she tore the notes out of my hand...
I suggested marriage counseling, but she's Lutheran.
Darling, I've got this terrible feeling there's something you're not telling me.
Hello 911. This is the man who mistook his wife for a hat? Remember me? Well, she just mistook me for a church door!
Customer service? I received my order of 95 Theses but I have a complaint about the delivery method.
Do you mind putting me up tonight? My wife just hand delivered divorce papers and I need a place to stay.
Well, she didn't shaft me...but I got her point.
Hello, Attorney Jones. My estranged wife has finally posted her list of demands.
Yes, I followed the directions.
Tell my attorney that I think she's serious this time.
Mueller here. I couldn't find anything.
I just had a disturbing visit from Martin.
Your process server is a bit overzealous.
Yes, he had some sharp words for me.
Enough with the targeted advertising.
Then she said, ‘Actually, I have 95 reasons.’
Well, I guess this is what I get for marrying a Luthern.
Now I know what you mean when you said divorce can be painful
Yes, Senator McConnell, I just took another stab at drafting a middle-class tax cut.
I was the one who filed for divorce but her fingerprints are all over it.
Her demands seem reasonable.
Our attempt to communicate without text messaging is not working
No, I can’t tell you what it says; but that’s not my complaint.
And then she said "I'll show YOU self-serving!"
I told you, it wouldn't have happened if I'd finished reading the instructions first.
Yes dear, I'm certain we can't back out of the agreement.
This is the second time he stabbed me in the back, this time literally with a rather convincing explanation
Yes, I gave him a copy of your resume. No, I think a follow-up phone call would be sufficient.
I have a message I am supposed to give you but I can't seem to find it.
I paid the rent Donald.
I think Doris has found someone else.
I understand that I can't get out of my contract. But can I get the contract out of me?
They hit me with the subpoena today.
At first, it seemed cool having Paul Hogan as a roommate, but I'm having second thoughts.
What was it you wanted me to read?
I thought I would be safe on the Ides of November.
The divorce papers are bad enough, but did the messenger have to shout 'Et Tu, Brian?'
When I find it I will get back to you.
I think you took your Notice of Eviction too far.
Yeah, until I put my foot down, my wife's Honey-Do list use to be a pain in the butt.
It's more of a stabbing pain.
I’m beginning to sense that I have a target on my back.
Yes dear, I got your list
It's always the fine print that kills me.
They're not playing pin the tail on the donkey the way I remember it.
Honey, where did you put the grocery list?
No, I didn't get your note.
Just confirming I'm still on the Do-Not-Call list.
I always thought she would do this, and knowing her there's a list somewhere as to the reasons why.
Can you hold? I believe I've been summoned.
Martin Luther was just here. He wasn't happy.
Yes, yes I got your point. You really know how to hurt a guy, don't you?
Hi. Sorry I'm not home right now. Please leave me a message.
Trust me, they can make the charges stick.
I don’t know why she left, Mom, but I do know that she was pretty angry.
I know I should have seen it coming that she would stab me in the back, but I just didn't expect her to be so literal about it.
Martin, eliminate the pre-nup.
She's finally left me. I think.
Something about the Reformation.
I was just about to change my shirt.....can you call back in a few minutes ?
He said he had my back.
I appreciate your being up front.
No! No more like that, I'll only accept emails.
I can't find your "to do" list.
A bit redundant, don't you think?
Hello? Mrs. Johnson? Your son just delivered his homework.
Yes, honey, I now see what you mean about those guys at the office who are always trying to pin it on somebody else.
Tell Trump to tweet me next time!
Yes, as a matter of fact, the employees union did present a list of their demands today.
I've had it with the 'honey do' list.
But dear, where do you put my to-do list?
Did you mean to post that on Craig's List?
I'm sorry you couldn't find the stamps.
No problem. My attorney has just back-dated it.
Apparently there are a hundred reasons why I deserved it.
Hello. Is this Bishop Rimbo at NYC Evangelical Lutheran Church? My name is Adorin Wittenburg. I'd like to talk to you about your 500th Reformation Anniversary re-enactment festivities.
I took a stab at the prenup.
Sorry for calling after hours, Carol, but did you get the performance review that I left on your desk?
Dear, there's still a few things I have to pick up. Oh, by the way, I got my severance package today.
Listen here, Martin, I told you I'd take a look at the church door and I will.
Would you please come over and tell me why Margaret left me?
I'd like to file a complaint against your collection agency.
I'm starting to sense that I've been neglecting my household chores.
Couldn't you have sent an email?
Yes, I'd like to inquire about your on-line billing option?
Ok, I’ve got the message.
The divorce papers came as a real stab in the back.
Martin Luther, please.
I'd like to discuss my cable bill.
I'm telling you I can't find it
I got 95 theses but indulgence aint one.
Let me take a stab at that.. No wait...!
About the health insurance premium increase reminder…
I think they nailed it!
Read between the lines? What about read between the ribs?
It's over, yet I feel nothing-- turns out I really am spineless
Seriously dear, I don't remember where you pinned the grocery list.
4,000 signatures telling me to quit telling my jokes at parties?
Mmm... it's more like a tingling sensation.
Put me on your no call list, stop with the constant emails and please refrain from knifing me in the back with your promotional materials!
Yes, I would like to make a complaint on how your subpoenas are served.
My autbiography, yes..... Yes, my ghostwriter wife did take a stab at it.
Yes Helen I got your note and frankly, I'm damn glad you're leaving.
Put me through to the Reformation desk please.
Tell me, again, where you put the “To Do” list.
No, I wouldn't call it a love letter.
I know you told me where the list was, but I still can't find it.
I cannot find my notes, I will have to call you back.
Thank God I didn't say "Shot through the heart"
Of course I wrote down all my passwords and email addresses, but retrieval isn't an option at the moment.
So exactly how far past due is my MasterCard?
No dear, what instructions?
Is this the desk? Could you send someone up to read the new codicil to my father's will?
We need new costumes. Joe and Anne are going as 'Martin Luther and the Church,' too!
Can you give me a clue where you left it?
Honestly, I wouldn't remember if you put a gun to my head.
I have received poison-pen letters, but right now I have a knife-in-the-back letter that's starting to hurt.
They love me at that office. They all tell me, "Don't worry, we have your back." I am still looking for my most recent evaluation.
Honey, where did you put the to do list?
I'm thinking of quitting the bible study group. The reformation is more challenging than I anticipated.
Yes officer , I realize this is a no fault divorce state .
Your friend Luther dropped by again.
I do not appreciate your back stabbing letter.
I was just standing in a church doorway...
My wife's Lutheran, Dr. Martz, so I'm guessing there are probably 95 complaints on her list for discussion at the next session.
Martin Luther’s first day as a process server.
Ummm...I think my wife knows about us.
Next time Paul McCartney tells you to let Martin Luther in? DON’T.
You said you’d get back to me.
Honey, what's an 'indulgence'?
I’ve been attacked by a Martin Luther impersonator.
Yes, I believe his last name is Luther.
I'd like to report an act of heresy.
Can't go bowling tonight. The wife just gave me her shopping list. She's serious this time.
I was trying to put death and taxes behind me.
I GET THE POINT LET ME GO TO A MIRROR AND READ YOUR OFFER MORE CLEARLY.
So I took a stab at being a letter carrier for a while.
Are you sure there is no way to have me unstuck from this contract?
I got your edits to the prenuptial agreement.
What's surprising is that we've never even considered divorce. Murder sometimes, but never divorce.
The editor back-stabbed me.
Yes, I suppose it could be murder-suicide, but I can't find any note.
Don't come in tomorrow? What are you talking about? I never saw any memo about layoffs.
After a while you get a pretty good feel for what people on the shop floor hold dear. But it's not all roses I can tell you!
I think a Lutheran did it
She signed the papers, I'm free.
But I already am Lutheran.
I got your 'honey-do' list dear ,but I'm having trouble reading it .
Much better, thanks. I've got a new lease on knife.
If I remembered the last place I put the suicide note, I wouldn't be calling, Carol.
DOES IT SAY ANNIVERSARY ?!!
Sorry, I forgot why I called.
Professor Plum speaking.
Yes, I'd like to file a complaint about the new delivery boy . . .
I don't think they liked my manuscript.
I have a pretty good idea what it says.
Of course I know where to find it.
Why yes, I am Lutheran.
I'm running a little late. I can't find the divorce papers.
I think she really means it this time.
I’ve got the list of demands.
A one hundred and fourty character betrayal would have been sufficient.
I believe it was Martin Luther.
Yes. I got your message. Point taken.
Your bill is killing me?
Hello, Room Service? Someone’s stuck me with a bill that isn’t mine.
Yes mother l have received Maria's divorce settlement demands .
Typical first day as a supervisor, some guy named Luther filed a complaint when he heard my name was Wittenberg.
She gave me another Honey Do list, but I don't think she's holding her breath.
I thought I got shot by Cupid but it was just my divorce giving me back pain again.
one more time...where did you say you put the grocery list?
Yes, I know you’ve got my back but that’s not why I’m calling
Hello, Mr. Luther? I think you missed the door.
I think I got the point of your memo.
Thought I would take a stab at Sundays crossword... but its harder than you think.
Yes, I received the papers from your lawyer today.
Yes, I did receive the papers that your lawyer sent.
Yes, Harold. I got your point.
Yes , Sir . I have received the bloody memo .
Not only did the deal fall through, but he also ruined my favorite shirt.
My wife stuck me with her to-do list.
What are you gonna do, stab me?
She's also getting my lawyer in the divorce.
About the final offer? I’m having trouble reading the fine print.
I didn't mean ANY idiot can understand an IKEA manual.
Yes, I got your note, but I haven't been able to read it yet.
Her demands are quite long and painful.
If you’re trying to drive a point, I got  it!
My boyfriend Brutus violated the restraining order.
Tell 3M that's NOT what I meant by a sticky note.
The papers were served today. I’m having trouble sitting down to read them.
Speak to a representative.
I think Lucille finally found a job she thinks I should apply for....
I didn't say your article was a betrayal, I said it was a knife in the back.
Hi Ester, I got your message. This is Bob. Does that mean we’re not going to dinner?
I prefer hate e-mail over mail
Look, I know he's the great great grandson of Martin Luther, but this is getting ridiculous.
Is that new will still binding?
I said to use asterisks, not daggers.
Of course I didn't realize Medicare Part C stood for "Caesar"!
I'd like to opt out of the class action suit.
I'm calling to speak to my lawyer regarding my divorce. My wife delivered the latest agreement, but I can't read it.
Well, I didn't see his face but it was definitely the contract killer.
I must be having a senior momemt....the contract was here a minute ago!
Circulation, please.
I can't read it, but am sure they left a note Sir!
OK, OK, I get the point!
That backstabbing judge really threw the book at me!
Yes officer, I didn't get a good look at her, but I believe it was my wife who served me the divorce papers.
Honey, those divorce papers really hurt...
Wow, that is a firm deadline.
It's either my prenup or the Paradise Papers, I'm not sure
You left a note?
Martin just gave me 95 reasons why I need to look for another job
That's right, I'll go back to paperless e-mail notification.
Where did you say you were going to leave the note to remind me?
Well, she finally had the papers served and I feel like I've been stabbed in the back.
I still want to believe that this will be an amicable property settlement.
No, I didn't read the terms and conditions!
I can't find the honey-do list you left me.
Yes, I'm pretty sure it's in English.
I get this feeling that someone has a contract out on me.
Yes, Attorney Bornstein, I have a nagging suspicion she's gone for good this time.
I'm very sorry I forgot the butter and lettuce last time, Marge, but I do think this reminder is a bit over the top.
She said she was serving me with divorce papers but I have yet to see them.
Hey, I got your flyer and I would like to order a large pepperoni.
She left me, Tom - and I still feel the after-effects.
How should I know what it says? I can't read it!
So you didn't like my column.
I need help, my wife just served me with divorce papers.
My wife stabs me in the back with divorce papers and you think I don't need an ambulance?
Yes, I received the subpoena.
All I said to my kids was, "Give me one good reason this family really needs cell phones"!
Remember the story about Luther pinning his demands on the church door?
I'm pretty sure he was trying to send me a message."
Honey, the kids are complaining about tofu night again.
I have a small issue with your terms and conditions.
Sorry honey, once again I lost the shopping list.
Just got the news from my wife!
No I haven't been able to read the contract yet." "Yes, they delivered a copy." "Um, about that....
You stabbed me in the back for all the wrong reasons!
Hello, I'd like to report another misdelivered letter.
What honey-do list?
Collections department, please?
Your words hit me really hard..
Could I speak to Martin Luther, please?
I just heard.
Got you urgent email, thx. I'm on it.
I didn't see it coming.
Utilizing two mirrors and a great deal of patience I believe she objects to our maintaining a landline.
That lawyer came by and dropped off the contract.
Honey, where did you say you left the shopping list again?
No, thank you. The back issues are painful enough.
No, I didn't see the message that you left.
She just served me with the divorce papers.
I think it's safe to say that today's negotiations are heading for binding arbitration.
My wife is talking about divorce again! I think this time she means it...
If you wanted me to get the message, you should have stuck it in my chest.
Please cancel the free service and sign me up for the friendly reminder service.
So that’s my backstory - how about you?
Yes, I know you hate reminding me all the time…but I can’t find that shopping list anywhere!
If the senator wants my vote, you might suggest a different strategy.
Sweetie, a service called Blade Runner delivered our divorce papers today.
Yes. I followed the instructions.
No, mother, we're not getting along. She just sent me another of her pointed comments.
I'd like to make an appointment for a couple's session.
I've been stabbed, literaturally.
Police? I want to report a daggered dowager.
Et tu, Monica?
I think she could have just said, "We're done."
Sorry boss but the contract negotiations have stalled
Tell Martin I found his theses.
Okay. But this to-do list you left is a real pain!
You're telling me a paper cut isn't an emergency?!
It’s not that I don’t want to, but my wife’s just reminded me that I’m behind on my chores.
To whom do I complain about your method of process serving?
She took the mirrors too, Ma.
I am calling about my eviction notice from Trump Tower......
I can't possibly get all these things done before you get home!
I think she's leaving me; she left a note
I'd like to cancel my extended warranty.
I think my wife wants a divorce.
Gotta go Stan; Marge just gave me a to do list.
In New York, we stab you in the front.
I swear, I'll sign the papers today.
Hon, I just got a message that our health coverage has been canceled.
You're being über-picky, mother. What difference does it make if she's Lutheran?"
Yes, I just got the memo.
911. We're out of post-its.
The pre-nup sort of spoiled the moment.
Sorry, hon, I just can't for the life of me find where you put the "to do" list!
Perhaps removing her from my will was not a great idea.
YES, NOW I GET THE POINT OF YOUR MESSAGE!
The lawyer left his bill in my apartment, but I can't see it anywhere!
..ok I'll take a stab at it, I think I have been served divorce papers
I was just served divorce papers and I'll need a good lawyer.
I think this is their best-and-final.
I think it's a letter from my wife's lawyer.
I agreed to let you take a stab at this, but com’on man?!!
My lawyer says the alimony part is clear, but he still needs your signature.
I'd like to make an appointment to see my chiropractor. My back is killing me!
YES, I’m calling from a landline.
My literary agent? A real backstabber...
No, actually, this a case where the messenger tried to kill me.
No, I didn't see the writing on the wall.
Divorce doesn't need to be overly adversarial.
I'd like to register a complaint about your take-out menu delivery person.
Now’s not a good time....
I was standing in front of the church door in Wittenberg...
If you played Hamlet with this level of commitment and emotion you would've loved my review.
I was served divorce papers today.
No, Margaret, I HAVEN'T been able to read it yet.
When she left me she said she posted a list of her grievances but I can’t seem to find it.
I know I stuck it somewhere. Let me get back to you.
Hello, 9-11? I would like to report that my wife and I had a heated disagreement on Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation.
It appears to be a suicide note.
I believe you've encouraged my son to do things the 'Lutheran way.
Sure, you hate phone calls, but I don’t like text!
I got the divorce papers
Oh, yes, I definitely got your message but I can't read it at the moment.
I’d like to report a stabbing in the back.
Office Depot? What range of bulletin boards do you have in stock?
I think my mother in law is trying to tell me something.
That gives new meaning to: 'I got your back.'
Can't wait until my voice mail is turned back on.
I get your point that the affidavit required nail-and-mail delivery, but I'm having a problem with the attachment.
I can’t find it anywhere.
Should I assume you're cancelling our date for Saturday?
I'd like to pay my overdue bill to the Knife of the Month Club. In full.
Your urgent memo got me before I got it. Next time try texting.
I think the bloom is off the rose...
Tell Mr. Luther I got his message.
Yes darling, I do need to confess; the evidence is overwhelming.
Valachi? You thought I said 'over knife' delivery?
Can't make it. Stuck with a honeydew list.
Tell Martin Luther I got the message.
After our last session, I’d like to add one to the list about “un-constructive attitude towards sharing grievances.” I’m gonna need your help with that.
It turns out that the prenup wasn't nearly as protective as expected.
I thought we agreed to disagree.
I can’t read backwards, though.
Yes Mr. President, I believe the tax reform vote is going well.
Got your message. Can we talk?
On the one hand I'm glad the divorce is final, but she really stuck it to me.
That's not funny
Yes, I was served the divorce papers.
Et tu, Janet?
My wife thinks I might be happier with e-mail billing.
I'm calling about the eviction notice.
Tee off without me. Something's come up.
To do list - call Brutus back
No problem, my wife reminded me to take a message.
I got served.
Yes, I'd like to know the protocol for delivering final notice of overdue payments.
I never received a notice.
Hello 911, my back has apparently been mistaken for a church door.
Feels like I've been served.
I'll get back to you soon.
She's not here.
My wife would like to dispute the Victoria's Secret charge on my account.
Yeah, Mom, I remember. You warned me not to marry a Lutheran.
Well, thanks for getting back to me!
I'll have to call you back. Some smart-ass just served me my wife's divorce paperwork.
i need a doctor! and a lawyer
Yes operator, ...I would like to report a problem with your billing department.
You might want to re-think your delivery service.
Guess how she responded to my taping 'Kick me' on her back.
She just gave me her edits ... yeah, they seem pretty firm. The sooner you can review them the better I will feel.
From now on if you want to leave me a note, just leave it on the kitchen table.....
Yes, I received your message.
Dont be silly. It’s just an expression.
Let me get back to you on that.
Yeah, still stressed as hell... Can't get that lousy subpoena off my back.
Hello, Lenny? My fiance' finally agreed to sign the pre-nup, somewhat reluctantly.
It just arrived by hand.
I don't know why, something about not having a pen.
They decided to pass on the manuscript.
No dear I haven't found your list of grievances.
She said if I lose the list one more time, she would find another way to remind me. Can't find it, but my back is killing me!
Yes sir, my neighbor stole the newspaper again this morning, but this time he returned it.
I'm just calling to let you know that your back order has arrived.
I think she gave me an ultimatum. No I haven't look at it!
My ex wife stopped by, but I don't see the legal paperwork she was suppose to drop off.
Can you convert me to paperless delivery?
Well, you always said men can’t find anything, but where’d you put the divorce docs?
He’s coming over to apologize, but I recommend you don’t indulge him.
Yes, I would say the divorce was messy.
All I said to her was do you have a list of what constitutes sexual assault.
I'm sorry, but I can't sign this.
Got to run. Madge gave me a ‘to do’ list.
I think we received the final notice for our subscription renewal.
Marge has gotten serious about the 'honey-do' list.
I guess the process server was Protestant.
Any messages?
Yes, yes I did get your honey-do list.
For some reason I get the feeling that I have a target on my back.
Well, my divorce is final but we might have to postpone the party.
It was more than a poison pen letter!
My lawyer says you really stabbed me in the back with this divorce
I'd like to back out of the deal.
You're right Mother, her understanding of 'taking the plunge' differs from mine.
Being sued by your best friend? Yeah, it's like...well...I can't describe what it feels like exactly.
The fine print really will kill you.
Don't worry, it's just a metaphor.
I never should've messed with the Lutherans
She said she’d stick me with divorce papers, but I haven’t seen them yet.
I need to come over and read something for me.
Listen, it’s more than just being read the riot act.
Yes, I'd like to opt-out of paper statements, please.
I think my complaint letter was well received.
Archibald's policy was to be nice to all the telemarketers who call, even during dinner, since they are only doing their job...
Home Depot? I'm going to need help with my wife's to-do list.
I just wanted to be clear as to whether this is a "final," Final Notice.
I'd like to update my will. The Grim Reaper just gave me an eviction notice.
Luther, when I told you to post your thesis, I meant online.
Process servers are getting really aggressive nowadays.
I'll get back to you. I just got the memo.
Is this the Lutheran Church?
Martin Luther was just here.
Acme Process Servers? Complaint Department, please.
She said she had some demands before she got back with me.
...searched high and low. And my back is killing me!
I don’t care if it IS Martin Luther’s birthday—that’s no way to leave me a shopping list!
Martin, how many times have I asked you to get glasses?
Hello Mr. Luther, we need to talk about Martin!
I think they liked my mystery manuscript.
I just got the petition on banning knives at school
Yes, a Bowie knife, in my back...I'm not sure, I think it's B-O-W-I-E...
Honey, remember when you told me you were going to put that To-Do list somewhere I couldn't lose it again?
No, I'm pretty sure it wasn't Scaramucci.
Yes, my name is Pope, the other man's name is Luther. He seemed angry about something.
Martin somebody.
Uh, yes, I'd like to discuss going paperless.
Et tu, Sweetheart?
She didn’t even leave a note...I feel like I’ve been stabbed in the back
I do believe knives are included in the second amendment.
No anchovies.
Hello Morty? Vera just delivered the papers and I think it's safe to say this won't be an amicable divorce.
At least she has my back.
If you had served me divorce papers, I think I would know.
I am really getting tired of you people delivering my mail to the wrong address.
Well, working from home doesn't make you immune from backstabbing...
Honey, I'm sorry but I seem to have misplaced the to-do list you left for me today.
I swear it's not fake news.
Somebody stuck me with a landline and a knife.
..hello..Police? This is Martin Luther. I'd like to report a case of extreme irony.
Where exactly did you leave the note?
I think my wife is trying to tell me something.
You are mistaken, I ordered the 95 pieces.
Where did you leave the instructions?
Not to worry! The senator assures me he has your back.
I'm a victim of fake news.
A vendetta? What's a vendetta?
I know that you are upset with me dear, but that was a cruel text message.
I just figured she'd leave a note, if she was going to stab me in the back.
She says it’s her 95 theses protesting my “attitude.”
The House's interpretation of tax reform is killing middle-class folks like me.
I have this stabby feeling there’s a “To Do” list just for me around here somewhere...
I should have never trusted the terms and conditions.
Dr. Schwartz? My wife didn't care for that letter of explanation you suggested I write.
All she said is, “You’ve been served.”
You were right honey. Steve IS a backstabber!
I thought you said you had my back. Where were you then?
No, I can’t tell. It’s either the Ninety-five Theses of Martin Luther or I was just served divorce papers.
You were right. They are still going behind my back
Hello, Vatican? I have mistakenly received a letter addressed to the Pope.
I haven't got the faintest idea about what's going on behind my back!
You tell me once you read it, but I'm going to go ahead and guess they want me off the board
Tu quoque, IRS!
Hello, Oswald? I need some legal advice....I think Gladys just filed for a divorce.
Gary, I received your list of demands, but I will not be moving my fence one inch.
Mrs. Luther. Martin mistook me for the door again!
I realize that this was my final notice." " Don't you think it a bit much?
Honey, do you know where you put your 'To do' list?
Yes, I’ve been served. You could have told me yourself.
I think I've just been served, but these things are hard to read.
Yes, Sonja. I did receive your divorce request.
I got your post-it note.
A vase with flowers. Why?
Yes, I did get your bill
I need to speak to the Pope concerning 95 complaints.
Yes, I would like you to read it; I'm stuck on one point.
I liked it better when you just left voice mails.
Thank goodness I was sitting!
The good news is he stopped tweeting.
And last, she's taking the dog.
Damn it, Finster, I specifically requested you send it by email!
Hello. I didn't think she was serious about the divorce thing.
Your mother just posted her own 95 Theses.
He told me, I've got your back.
I put the election news behind me.
Yes, I got the message but I haven't been able to get to it.
Hang on a sec. I think Elaine just responded to my pre-nup.
I got your point. I just can't read the fine print.
I won't be golfing today; I am stuck at home with a huge honey-do list.
where's that letter I must sign and mail?
Yeah, Carol served me with divorce papers, I always knew she would stab me in the back.
I've been the victim of a targeted ad campaign.
Someone's sent me a message—but I can't read it.
No, I haven't seen the summons yet.
Received your note. The answer is yes.
next time would you please consider a paperless e-delivery....
Please hold. Your call is important to us, too, and our agent will be with you in the order it was received.
It was good of your father to drop off the pre-nup.
My wife said she put the grocery list where I couldn’t lose it.
It's a Martin Luther like pain in my upper back.
The tax bill is a real back-stabber for everyday people like us.
No 'King', just Martin Luther
She's not interested in a prenup.
I'll get back to you; I have a stabbing pain in my back.
So I have to keep the landline because it’s part of the boilerplate?
Yes, I just received your decree.
Yeah, I"m pretty sure it was a process server.
Since you put it that way, yes, I will keep the landline.
The backstabbers are at it again and somehow I feel they are writing about me!
I couldn't read the fine print, but I don't think it said 'Have a nice day.'
No, it's an actual backstabbing text.
I’d like to report a thesis nailing.
I hope it's a Dear John letter.
He said his name was Luther
it’s the first time I have been confused for.a Church door
Hello, this is Room 462. I need a drink.
It's not from my wife; that would have been one sentence, written badly.
I don’t how she expects me to respond to her demands when they are presented this way.
They explained the fine print as I was leaving.
When did Pin the Amendment on the Lawyer become a game?
As you well know, I can't read what it says.
Lye down and wait.That's your best advice?
Yes, doctor, he went to the Halloween party as Martin Luther.......
Yes, I'd like to report a letter that was delivered to the wrong address.
What? No, I can't read French
The point is obvious.
No it was the other Martin Luther. The one who was less nonviolent.
Yes...I got the divorce papers...which I have pointedly decided not to sign.
Luther's back.
Honey, Where'd you put that grocery list?
How is my day going? Not too bad, I just got a new cell phone plan. How are you?
My boss found a new way to get under my skin
All because I wouldn’t sign the petition for stronger gun control.
The government just won't get off my back!
Louisa served me with the Divorce Papers
I get the point. You need a back story along with the manuscript.
I think we have to rewrite the prenuptial agreement.
I found your shopping list.
One thesis would have been sufficient.
I'm not sure, but I think my wife wants a divorce.
I won't be into today. I have something wrong with my back.
No honey, it's not a metaphor...
She said something about my being thick as a church door.
I couldn't see him, but he might be Lutheran.
I'm sorry, she's not here right now. Can't say when she'll be back.
It doesn't just say "Kick me". It's legally binding.
I'm sorry, Mom, I have to hang up now. Dora seems angry about something, and I should probably find out what it is.
Honey, I can’t seem to find where you pinned the grocery list anywhere.
I don't know what he was so pissed at. He was ranting about indulgences, papal authority, something about church doors and how Apple Maps had screwed him again.
I can’t shake the feeling I’ve been stabbed in the back.
As my lawyer you said she might reject the divorce papers but she went way too far!
Marketing department, please.
Did you let the subscription to witnessprotection.com run out . . . ?
Just for that, now you're not getting the house in Amagansett.
I have a feeling that her divorce terms are payback, but I really can't see the point.
Yes, I got your point, Dear. And thanks for printing in reverse.
Dear, please remind me. Where did you put your "honey do" list?
No, sorry, Marty Luther just left.
watch your own back!
I know. I got your note.
Apparently she is serious about my signing the divorce papers
I don't know if there are ninety-five; I can't see them.
Where's the list?
She just tacked up her manifesto.
‘She was yelling something about Martin Luther when she left.”
Hi honey. I can't find the to do list.
No, she DOES hate me. The note she left says so.
I'm think she's serious about the divorce
Divorce papers, can you believe it? I wish there was a phrase for what she's done to me.
Yes, that's right. A new message from Martin Luther.
The DNC has some paperwork for Senator Sanders.
Just a hunch, but you could try reaching her at her mother's.
Yes, I've read the new tax bill.
I understand...but all I said was you better make sure I get a copy of the agreement!
She seemed surprised that I asked her to take a stab at drafting the pre-nuptials.
I've decided against contesting the divorce.
Yes, I received your text
I bet you won't say that to my face!
"I'm calling about your 'money back' guarantee.
Ironically my ex-wife was the one doing the screaming.
I've been served. By a man in a cloak.
How long do I have to ignore the subpoena?
On a scale of 1 to 10?
I’d like to report an attempted divorce filing.
First, she shoves it in my face and says her lawyer drew it up. Then, she tells me I'm numb in every conceivable way! Now, she's gone and I can't find the damned thing!!!
Please inform our readers to submit negative comments in writing.
I'd like to withdraw my candidacy.
What do you mean 'they killed the story'?
She called it, "pin the divorce on the donkey"
I don't know what it says but I know it's there.
At least, she remembered I don't like multiple exclamation points.
I wish you hadn’t done it that way. I keep a paperless office.
OK, I got your point.
I received your divorce papers.
I hate to admit it, but hiring Buffy the Process Server was actually a nice touch.
I have no idea, Officer...all I told her was that she knew where she could stick her "To Do" list
I can't keep ignoring her cries for attention.
And how do you expect me to read your Honey-do list?
No, it's not break-in. If you must know, it's the Housewife's Manifesto.
I feel the airline might be changing its frequent flier policy.
But I never subscribed to the Daily Blade!
I can't talk now, I'm in the middle of a divorce.
Hello is this the IRS I have I noticed from you about back taxes
You're leaving me? Well why didn't you leave a note?
The divorce is off to a good start.
The goodbye letter you left me seems a little harsh.
I got your message to call.
What's an indulgence?
Apparently there are some things I need to do before I play golf.
No, I haven't seen it. What did you say you pinned it to?
She seems to have disappeared but she did leave a note....
I think I’ve finally mastered the office politics.
I wish it just read "Kick me!"
I'm calling about that "Final Notice" you sent me.
I thought we had agreed for the kids' sakes we would not let this get ugly.
911? Emergency! I have been stabbed in the back. . . . My wife! . . . Divorce papers!
Hello . It's about the back issue of The New Yorker I ordered .
Honey, you could have used a thumbtack.
I called you so you can tell me how you really feel about us.
He says he’s a sharp negotiator, but I’m still waiting for him to get back with a detailed offer.
That divorce petition my wife filed is behind me now.
Put a fork in it.
I want to report a missing dossier
It could be worse. She might have passed that pistol background check.
Basically it says 'kick me,' in legal jargon.
Yes, I know where you put the papers from your lawyer, but I don't know what they say.
No, ma'm, I can't actually read you the list of demands right now, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the gardening dispute I've been having with my neighbor.
Can you remind me?
I wish he would go back to tweeting.
Hello 911? I think I've been 'Martin Luthered' by my wife.
And I want you to tie the response to a brick and throw it through her window.
Ambulance to Joe Wittenberg, 95 All Saints' Lane.
I thought the suggestions were supposed to be anonymous.
Honey, did you move the plant on the neighbor’s balcony?
But I thought that 14 year old girl wanted me to write a love note in her yearbook.
Hello 911....I'm having a big problem with the Republican health care plans.
Luther household. No, Martin's not at home. Something about us being indulgent or something
His twitter account is down.
Your note was insensitive and your grammar atrocious .
Can't talk now, Mom, Darlene just gave me a shopping list.
I'm pretty sure the divorce is final now.
Yeah, so... she brought over the papers this morning..
You could have called too.
Not right now, thank you, I have a few things on my list that I have to do first.
Tonight's no good, the wife's really getting adamant about my to-do list.
Would you please re-send that via email?
I think someone's trying to send me a message.
Happy Martin Luther anniversary to you too
Same to you, fella.
Martin Luther? He just left.
She is reliable to a fault. Whenever she leaves she leave a note.
Hello....Mr. Luther
Hi, I am calling to complain about my Caesar salad delivery.
Well, she did explain herself.
I want to report a “Post No Bills” violation!
I'd love to, but my wife has a couple of things around the house she'd like me to take care of.
Oh, yeah, believe me. These rules will stick.
Then she screamed, I CAN NOT LIVE ANOTHER MINUTE WITH YOUR PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE DULLNESS!, then the phone rang and as I was walking over to pick it up she pinned the divorce papers to my spine with a steak knife... and how 'bout you, how're you doing?
Sigh... yeah... she left a note.
Hello, Daily Gazette? May I speak to someone in customer relations?
I don't think she wants to sign the prenup.
No Doris, she did not sign the divorce papers - I was lucky to get out alive!
Honey, I didn't mean this when I asked you to give me a to do list.
Hi Mom. I think Betty just sent me the divorce papers.
Yes, I will hold
Billy is going through a Martin Luther phase.
Not tonight, I have this stabbing pain in my back.
No officer, they didn’t leave a ransom note.
I got the divorce papers
Gladys, I think I just got the divorce papers.
Martin Luther came by -- left you a message.
Yes, please cancel the private investigator. I've already been served.
well it's signed... but we need to talk about beneficiaries again
Maybe I'm dense, but I still don't get your point.
Yes, I'd like to speak to someone about a single point of contact.
Hello Jerry? I've been served.
I would like to make a change to my last will and testament
Specialty Process Servers, about that divorce summons you just served.
It's killing me that I can't find it.
Yes, I showed her the divorce settlement offer and I think she wants to talk.
Yes, I have already received your advice
Yes, I'm sure everyone knows my back story.
Hi, I'd like to murder a report.
May I speak to the Pope?
That angry writer whose book I edited sent me a long letter about the difference between literal and figurative language.
I believe he said his name was Martin Luther.
Yes dear, I still have the shopping list you 'gave' me.
She just stepped out
Is that your final offer?
I just wanted you to know that your lawyer delivered your reply to my alimony request.
All I did was defend the Catholic church
Mr. Bannon? I got your note.
Dr. Lewis, It's Fred. I hate to leave a message like this on your answering machine...but please call me back ASAP. I have a sudden sharp pain right between my shoulder blades. Thanks
I am aware that lawyers hear 'stabbed me in the back' all the time, but this time you'll have written proof of motivation *and* physical evidence.
Indulge me.
Fine! I admit it....converting to Catholicism was a bad idea.
Sheryl, put my MAGA hat on eBay, will you?
I would like to stop delivery of your publication.
...furthermore, I can prove that it wasn't me who wrote the suicide note...
Yes, my wife threw it, and it's the Help Wanted section.
Yes, my wife left me the divorce papers a short time ago.
They've backed up their demands.
The pain is up to, like, 11.
I take it your new to back channel communications.
Hi honey. Yes, I got your note.
I'd like to report a citing....I swear it was Martin Luther.
His name was Luther, and his memo has ninety-five theses.
Thanks! But I didn't need my resume back.
Call me old-fashioned but I liked it better when they just handed you the summons.
No, I still do not wish to sign up for e-billing.
Honey, I can't find the grocery list.
I think my writing career is looking up - this time they didn't just hand the manuscript back to me.
So if I can't see the summons, I can skip the court appearance?
I think my wife wants a divorce.
The brochure promised a memorable time in Germany.
Next time, please post my foreclosure notice in a place where I can read it.
"It's more serious than 'Kick Me!'
My lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.
What we have is a failure to communicate appropriately.
Yeah, I think I got her wish list ...
Our marriage is undergoing a reformation.
"I need to start reading my contracts more carefully. Some of the terms are real killers".
I knew that student debt would stab in the back someday.
I need to see a doctor for a work related injury.
She read Martin Luther a lot.
I'm hurting real bad--my wife just served divorce papers on me.
Sweetheart, I can’t find the Honey Do List.
I take it that’s your final offer..?
Janice, the cable company just delivered a late payment notice.
Et tu, Schrute?
Hello 911 ? My wife has upped the ante on her Honey-Do list.
Nothing's left in your closet. You could have at least written a 'Dear John' letter.
She said no more indulgences.
I must say, he did get my attention.
You surprised me, I was served the divorce papers today.
Jane, you really stuck it to me this time, didn't you?
I think she's leaving me.
I didn't read the whole thing, but I get the point.
He said his name was Luther.....Martin Luther, I believe.
Hi Honey, where did you say you left the grocery list?
Honey, have you seen the letter from my ex?
It feels kind of protestant with a burning heretic kind of sensation.
In the future please use your Twitter account!
I was just standing in front of the cathedral door and this guy came up behind me...
No, officer, it only feels like ninety-four theses.
Well, it’s a just a standard prenup ...
Hi Mom, Shelia is divorcing me. No, it won't be friendly but I can't really see her point of view.
I'd like to report a to-do list.
Your terms and conditions are unacceptable
My wife reminded me of a few more things to consider before the agreement can be signed in blood.
I'm pretty sure it was Martin Luther.
I'll sign, dear. Just remind me where you left the papers.
Thanks for taking a stab at the grocery list.
I'd like to report a missing suicide note.
Well Mr. Trump, I know it’s not Scaramucci. He’s a front stabber.
Let me call you back. Doris just served the divorce papers.
Margaret, I hope after the divorce is final, we can still be friends.
i know i know. i should have never roomed with martin luther
Well, yes. He was quite adamant about it.
Cancel the tee-time...I feel a piercing need to work on her to-do list.
Yes, I know you want a divorce but I'm not sure if the best choice for your attorney was Martin Luther.
Doctor, my wife is protesting again.
My wife did a Martin Luther thing
Did you leave your note where I'll see it?
Yes, it's safe to say that I do understand the importance of completing my list before your sister arrives
I can't find those divorce papers that I sent to my wife.
Hello 911 - There's a Picture Hanging On My Wall And I Did Not Put It There.
NO I can’t read paragraph 2a back to you
(What's your emergency?) "I can't find the To-Do-List my wife wrote."
Yeah Ralph, Don't ever set me up with a girl again, ok? This one was a back stabber,.. literally!
I thought you said the divorce papers would be mailed.
Hi, customer support? I’m a having a bit of an issue putting my IKEA shelf together. I think the instructions are a bit off
No. I did not see the note you left for me.
No, I won't forget the Parmigiano-Reggiano this time.
Can't talk now..... I have a 'Honey Do' list that is imperative!
I believe it's an actuarial notice but it's hard to see.
I know I'll appreciate your latest communication if I live to read it!
The news is killing me these days.
Mom said she won't sign the will.
Yes, Mr. Luther. The name IS Worms but I think you've got the wrong idea.
The divorce papers have come through.
Martin Luther, you get home this instant!
I'd love to join you, but I'm planning to surprise the wife and get going on some honey-do projects
I'd like to. Report a badly botched suicide.
Honey, have you seen our prenup?
My wife claims it's because she ran out of refrigerator magnets.
I just got the letter from your attorney. He made of point of delivering it himself.
Yeah. Hi. I have a quick questions about the recent credit card bill I received from you which covered my last business trip. Actually ... its more my Wife that has the questions. Can I Hold? ... Well ... I do need to make another call fairly soon.
I suppose it's better than having them hang over your head
Well, to take a stab in the dark, I guess she used a knife.
I should have never named my son Luther!
I didn't know it was a hostile merger offer
These new, “Made in the Philippines” tags are getting to be a bit much I think.
She's been saying "it's over" for years. I think she means it this time.
Thanks for the reminder.

Who doesn't love a game of 'Pin the Mail on the Donkey'?
How should I feel about tax reform?
Honey, I've looked everywhere for the grocery list.
Yes, I found the divorce papers.
I'd like to find out who ordered the stab-o-gram.
In case your wondering, I was just served with the subpoena.
Honey... I think we can rest assured that the kids are on the "naughty list" again this year.
The Reformation Day party was a little wild.
Mitch McConnell calling. The president says he can't find his copy of the Constitution anywhere.
Just wanted to clarify-- Are those divorce papers, or the "to do" list you posted
Sorry, no "poker night" - the wife's pretty serious about her "to do" list.
I am having a problem with some guy named Martin Luther....
I know I promised, but I can't find the 'honey-do list' anywhere.
I received your note. Yes, sir...it was concise and to the point.
Where did you say you put the divorce papers?
I need someone to read the notice on my back, it might be urgent
What do you mean how do I know the sports section is missing? I just know.

Tell the Senator that I can't vote on the tax plan because I haven't read it yet.
911, i think im having a constitutional crisis.

Yes, I am aware that my voicemail is full.
The magazine didn't buy my short story, but at least it was a personal rejection this time.

The paper says crime rate is down. That sounds like Fake News to me.
You couldn't just put them on the front door?
Your writ of habeas corpus has been received.
Luther? You agreed to hang your 95 Theses on the Cathedral door! This makes me feel like I've been stabbed me in the back.
But it's not signed.
No, Counsel, I don't think she's going to accept the divorce terms we demanded.
Hey mom, these bills are killing me.
And this was my favorite shirt.
I'd go shopping for you if I knew where you put the grocery list!
No, mom, I still haven't signed the divorce papers.
Mom, it's over. She didn't exactly like the prenup idea.
I made the Trump List!
Sticky notes were just not working for me.
Counselor, seems she declined to sign the separation agreement....
All I said was 'Why can't they protest more like Martin Luther?'
Here I stand, I can do no other.
I can't read the fine print.
Hello? Martin Luther Hospital?
I've looked everywhere. Where did you put the grocery list again?

I can't read it right now, I'm waiting for a ride to the emergency room.
Obviously, I did not read the fine print.
Marge, can you come over and take a note?
Her lawyer's a Lutheran.
Yes Don Corleone - you could say I got the message.
I sense you are unhappy.
I don't think counseling will help. She was pretty adamant about me signing the divorce papers.
Sure, kick me is KINDA funny...
Explain that again. I'm not sure I got your point.
Hello, I'm calling to cancel my subscription.
Yes sweetheart I did receive your Dearr John letter…
I think someone's trying to tell me something.
at first I thought it was a pat on the back
Yes operator,I’m aware it’s uncommon to request an ambulance for a paper cut..
Office politics has gotten really nasty.
As best I can tell, it's from the Homeowners' Association.
On the bright side, she only had 93 theses.
Hi, Martin. I get your points.
Yeah, I guess we can take another stab at it.

Yes, Scaramucci just gave me the memo.

Honey, I wish you hadn't left the "to do" list in such a hostile manner.
Honey, the children have a list of reforms. I fear they are on the verge of starting a new family without us.
I get the impression she won’t sign the nondisclosure agreement.
How could I have seen this coming?

You were wrong. The persecution complex wasn't all in my head.
I have a complaint about my postman.
I need to report an aggressive process server.

Yes, Honey. I received your to-do list.
That's the last time I'll believe Paul Ryan.
Your list of complaints seem a bit sharp.
Honey, where did you place my last will and testament?
Hello, is this Pope Francis? I have a list of issues that I'd like to discuss with you.
Yes, but there was no reason for you to have the divorce papers delivered so pointedly.
It's like the modern day version of that Martin Luther thing, but it's about all of her grievances.
Yes, I'd like to request a song by the Ojay's....
I think it has something to do with Luther's Ninety-five theses.
No, but she may have left a note.
All this paperwork is killing me.
Where did you leave the 'honey-do' list?
They cut me out of their will.
That's just like you. How do you expect me to read it?
Now you're just being sarcastic, clearly the pun was intended.
What do you mean we're finished? No, I haven't seen your letter!
I’m not positive but I think it might be my ‘honey do’ list!

I'm sorry to bother you Honey, but tell me again where you left the divorce papers.
apparently with some provocation
I said: "Do I look like a German Church? And, by the way, it's 2017 not 1517!!!"
Rev. Luther? Steve Dore here. Just a suggestion, but how about posting your notice on the cathedral door instead?
I haven't had a chance to read it yet, Mr. President, but I've been told it states that giving to the poor is more important than buying indulgences.

Yes I checked the box but does anyone really reads the Terms and Conditions!!!
Did you ever hear of Ninety-five Theses?
These hidden fees are killing me

Hi. I'm calling for take-out.
Let me get back to you on some of those recommentations. I have a number of suggestions from my wife.
It’s not so much a paper cut. More of a paper stab.
I haven't looked yet but I think it's a honey-do list.
He looked like Martin Luther.
I don't know the details, but she gave me a painful ultimatum.
Not my idea of being put on notice
I said the contract terms are stuck, rhymes with suck.
Any ideas where you put the "to-do" list you gave to me this morning?
Hi, Jacob. My wife just signed and gave me the divorce papers.
Is the dire shortage of fridge magnets likely to end soon ,if not what alternatives can you suggest ?

My suicide note is attached.
"One way or another, the divorce is final whether she signed them or not".
I am done playing Mr Nice Guy!
Remember when ole professor psycho stapled my first rejected thesis to my forehead? Well,
Sorry, I can't make it. I brought some work home."
Go ahead and laugh. I don't have a cell phone. But at least I don't communicate the way my wife does.
I got your note, next time send a text.
They really stabbed me in the back with that pink slip.
Godot finally showed
You knew I wasn't Protestant when you married me.
Dear, we have to talk about your honey do lists.
Well, Doctor, the way to describe the pain is my wife, she showed me a job in the classifies advertisement and when I pointed out I was not qualified I had a sudden piercing pain in my back, like a knife !
I want to speak to someone about my latest overdue bill payment notice.
It's not my fault if you posted notice where I can't see it.

Yes, you can get it in paper back.
No kidding, I was stabbed in the back and there is a note attached.
Yes, I got your memo.
The Condo board liked almost all of my suggestions..
Whoever it was seems to have their reasons.
She did say she'd stick it to me in the divorce, but I think we need to change our strategy.
My wife delivered the divorce papers in person.
I guess it was too long for a Tweet.
This tax form is killing me
Hi Honey, I guess I wasn't listening before, where did you say you left the grocery list?
My wife says she doesn't recognize the knife but she hasn't been too honest with me lately.
I'm beginning to suspect that my wife knows about us.
Yes, I did receive the message. I just can't read it.
Honey, couldn’t you have used a post-it for your list?
It has something to do with the selling of indulgences.
Well, in a nutshell, it says sharpen the knives.
His name? He called himself Stabby McBackstab.
Yeah, she really stabbed me in the back with the divorce papers.
I'm not signing that contract, you backstabber!
My wife would like the Ceaser salad.
It's an existential crisis.
Honey!.. the "too-do" list is becoming a real pain.
I am a little busy right now, call my Heirs.
I just have enough time to say that you've made your point.
The divorce papers came in the mail today and my wife is really trying to stab me in the back
She did it right after I insisted that I could buy an indulgence.
Hello Doc. I think I have a paper cut.
I can't sign the divorce papers if I can't reach them.
Actually, no. I'm not happy with the terms of my long distance plan.
Yes, I know you left me a good-bye letter while I was sleeping.. No, I haven't read it yet.
It was just another day at the office.
Ever since we finalized the divorce, Doc, I've had this nagging pain between my shoulder blades.
There's a note; but I'm not sure if it says when she'll be back.
Yes, I got your message and your point was well stated but it still hurts!
I don't know whether there are fingerprints on the handle.
I can’t read it. I just know it hurts.

I think it all started in 4th grade when someone taped a "kick me" sign on my pants.
I told you the bill for Corleone’s garage was due...
I haven’t read that yet
Hello. This is Martin Luther. I'm afraid I've made a terrible mistake.
I seem to be stuck with a policy - and I am having trouble reading the fine print.
I like to proclaim a stabbing.
The health insurance agent came by. They're denying my claim.
I know my back’s up, but what are they saying behind my back?
He didn't CARE that we're Jewish!!!!
It only hurts when I do something unconstitutional.
My wife thinks I don't pay any attention to her to-do lists.
Your delivery method leaves a lot to be desired!
Hi. I've been attacked by my insurance small print. Yes, I'll hold.
At the tone, leave a message in my back
Frankly, I can’t see the point of your essay.
Caeser's form of fake news
Honey, can you remind me where you put that list of things you wanted me to do?
I'm taking a stab at it right now!
Yeah, I'm gonna need help filing my fed tax return this year.
No, I think the "to do list" has stopped the bleeding....
Really! I get your point.
Yes, I'd like to order a box of thumb tacks.
i’m just curious - is the contract really binding?
That's all she wrote
No, operator, I can’t read what it says. But I think you’re missing the point.
I'm sorry honey, I don't mean to be insensitive. But I just can't find that note you left me.
I was just served with divorce papers--I have a hunch she found out about our affair

Senator, this new tax bill is a stab in the back to the middle class.
May I take a message?
Please come quickly! There’s a lunatic dressed up like Martin Luther running around the neighborhood.
Exactly what message delivery service are you using?
We need to talk about this list you stuck me with.
I still cannot understand what you want from me.
It’s not the content that I resent so much as the sensation of being stabbed in the back.
What I understand is that the U.S. Postal Service isn't good enough for you.
The good news is that my 'to do' list is behind me now.
Hello...yes, I am looking for a lawyer. I believe my wife would like a divorce but I am not able to read the papers she left with me.

It wouldn't hurt so much if you had fired me to my face!
Honey, help me out. I couldn't find the shopping list!
Senator McConnell? You told me the individual mandate on income tax would not be repealed, but I see from your note no intention to take my advice.

After a review of the service agreement you ‘delivered,’ I’ve changed my mind and decided not to cancel my cable service at this time.
Give me a second--let me find my glasses--where'd I put that bill?
Okay, I'll give you the divorce.
She said she left a note but I can't find it..
She didn't even leave a note.

He told me I need to reform.
Sorry, I haven't had a chance to read about your rate increase yet.
I am sorry that I have to tell you this, but we must begin paying back our student loans.

I haven't seen your letter. Are you sure you put enough postage on it?

I checked in the mirror and I think it starts out "We the People..."
911 - I just got stabbed by Fake News
My wife just informed me she's leaving...
Of course I heard you say 'I'm putting the shopping list right here'. I just wasn't looking at where 'here' was exactly.
I'd better let you go--I think it's urgent.
Next time, if you want to leave a message, please do so on the answering machine.
Reason for returning the Whambo boomerang dagger?...well it's hard to control and the directions are way too long.
Got the message. Can't read it.
Don't get mad again, honey, but can you tell me once more where you put my "to do" list?
OK! OK! Your mother already sent me the shopping list!
But i thought the mini-bar was free.
I know you left me with a "to do list," but it's on backwards.
I've just received the divorce papers. I'm guessing that you're really not in the mood to discuss reconciliation?

I know you said you want me to stop procrastinating and get going on your honey-do list, but isn't this carrying it a bit far?
Hello, 911? I need help. Someone has mistaken me for the door of Wittenberg Castle church!

I know it’s here somewhere. I’ll call you right back.
The negotiations were painful, but we've got a deal.
Yes, I was eating cake when my son went all Martin Luther on me. I think he misunderstood the meaning of indulgences.
I recognized him, officer. His name is Luther, Martin Luther. Very nearsighted, insisted I was a door.

It's an old school tweet.... from him.
My lawyer stabbed me in the back
My wife insisted on personally serving me with the divorce papers.

Yeah...they smile in your face...all the time, they want to take your place...
I know she wasn't happy about the non-discloser agreement, but for $5,000,000 I didn't think she would stab me in the back and publish it.

Well officer, I was just walking into church and...
My wife is missing; last I saw her she was mumbling something about how insensitive I am.

I’m sorry Martin, I just don’t get the point.
Her divorce decree? No, I haven't seen it yet.
Remind me not to attend Lutheran conventions.
My wife strongly suggested I call you.
Yes, I heard that it passed The House, but I still have no idea what's in it.

I get this pain every time I pay my bills
I realize you’re upset, dear, but did you have to hire Gloria Allred?

"And I'm sick of her cutting remarks".
You said there was a grace period!
Hello, police... I just had some guy at my door dressed like a monk. Said his name was Luther. Rambled on about a reformation or something. I yelled for my wife but when I turned back around to he was gone!
What memo? Where did you leave it?
Indulgences? I think you've got the wrong number.
Do you have any _other_ messages for Room 909?
Dear, I can’t find those legal papers you say were served on me anywhere.
She just served me the papers: I think she wants a divorce.
My wife said she left a note explaining why she was leaving me but I can't find it
So Dear, where again did you say you left that honey-do list?
Actually, my wife handles all the bills.
Will call you back after I find my to do list!
Mom? Wow, what ironic timing for your call.
Yes, I got the subpoena. Your lawyer made his point quite clearly.
Summons Service Department, please!
Well....no, I didn't sign-up for paperless statements.
This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "print is dead."

'Next time you send me to negotiate I'm gonna need to go in with a bulletproof contract.
And so then I said “Dear, I’m not the Help Desk, you need to figure out how to back up your documents on Sharepoint yourself.”

Yes, she just delivered the divorce papers.
Where did you say you put the note?
She claims I'm oblivious to what she's trying to communicate.
Yes, I got your report. No, I haven't read it yet.
I'm afraid she took it literally.
She'll kill me if I forget.
911 I feel a sharp pain in my tax return
I get a sense she wants the same order as last time.

Sandra, if you just told your lawyer to call me first he could have mailed me the divorce complaint.

Yes, dear, I'll remember the shopping list this time.
Did we read the warranty? Well, my wife took a stab at it ...
Yes, honey - I trust you.
No, I have absolutely no complaints about my new insurance agent. I would simply request that you have Mr. Gambino email my bills from now on.
Luther. Martin Luther
You were right, Mom. I shouldn't have married a Lutheran.
Hello, suicide hotline? I wrote a note, but I can't seem to find it.

No Dear, I haven't misplaced gentle reminder for the Honey Do List this time!
Et tu, Blue Cross?
Can we go back to good fences?
Honey, where's that shopping list?
Hey Al, you know how my wife hates technology. Well, she finally went off the deep end when she couldn't find a bulletin board to post her ultimatum on.
Okay, so I don’t have eyes in the back of my head! What’s your point?
If you haven't clicked "yes" on the software update, yet, maybe hold off a little longer.
Hurry home, honey. The kids are starting to make demands.
It's either my last will and testament or my divorce papers.
Hi, I’m trying to reach Martin Luther
Ninety-five, I think. Why?
I asked her to scratch my back, like always, and when I turned around she'd disappeared.
They failed at Repeal and Replace, so they mandated a new way to deliver diagnoses.

I don't know where she went, she said to sign the divorce papers but I cant find them anywhere!
Yes, honey, I’ll add that to my to-do list.
I am taking a stab at the to-do list as we speak !
The divorce papers were just served.

Yes, I’d like to switch cable providers.
"She said that I was Whittenburg and she was Luther"!

Was this really necessary, I said, "I got the message."
So I hear you refused my settlement offer
Hello Don Giovanni - I got your message
Thankfully, I was shielded by the large pile of the paperwork.
My back pain began right after our sales meeting when I asked the competition to make their point obvious!
E tu Martinus?
I can no longer represent my client in this matter.
I am stuck with a newspaper I did not order...
About your manifesto...
I got her message. OK, she can have the dog!
Yes, it's still on the market. But we might want to bump our offer a tad.
Oh, the same old, same old in the office...how was your day?
Room Service, I feel a really bad draft in my suite."
I got your list of grievances. Could we discuss them, possibly at the emergency room?
I've heard rumors I'm getting the pink slip, but so far, nothing.
She was insulted by the pre-nup.
No, I do not have a history with Martin Luther.
Tell Martin Luther to call me back. I'm really upset.
I have a problem but you can rule out Martin Luther.
The order distinctly spelled out A-R-R-O-W !
That information is just out of reach.
Guess I should have made the Honey Do list a higher priority
You know I can't read backward.
Your written notice was sufficient.
Do you deliver thumbtacks?
I need a lawyer- my wife stabbed me in the back with the divorce contract.
Two words. White board.
Press One if you're the victim of an enthusiastic Lutheran. Press Two if the twins are up to high-spirited mischief again...
I wouldn't quite go so far as to call it tax relief.
I’m calling from a landline because those cell phone contracts are killers.”
You said it would be an amiable divorce.
I thought taxes were a pain in the ass for a middle-class guy like me, so I voted for Republicans. But I just finished reading the GOP tax plan. . . .
As a matter of fact, I have been talking to Russians.
How the heck am I supposed to know what it says? It's in my back!
Where did you say you put my to-do list?
So, you did get my love letter? ... Uh-huh ... Well thanks for letting me know you don't feel the same way. ... Goodbye.
....alright, but the president said 'the constitution got your back'....
Oh, message on MY back, I thought it was call YOU back
darling I think a thumbtack would have sufficed
Hi Herb. I need you to come over and confirm something. I think Margaret just served me divorce papers.
Yes dear, I found your to-do list.
I'd like to place an order for someone to watch my back. How soon will that be delivered?
I'm gonna need another copy of those divorce papers.
It's not so much a death threat as a manifesto.
Yes I will sign the divorce agreement—where did you put it?
Can't you just leave my "honey-do" list on the table?
I'm bleeding out and maybe have 4 minutes to live, tops. So, you've got to listen to me. Twin Peaks, man. It's not just weird for weird's sake. Seriously, give it a chance.
No doctor, it just started this afternoon!
Hello, is this Mafia messages?

Wittenburg was lovely.
I'd like to downgrade my life insurance policy. Do you have anything with tape?
Please take me off your stabbing list.
I found your note but I didn't read it... I assume you're not coming back, forgive the pun.
It's a sharp pain in my back radiating toward my wallet
No...it's worse than that.
Yes, I'm sure she means it. No, I did not see it coming.
It’s Wittenberg. Dr. Arthur Wittenberg.
There must be something between this and a tattoo.
He said I make a better door than a window.
It's about the advertised new use for the Ginsu knive.

Can you please just deliver my bills through the mail.
Yes I see you got my back.
I got your notes and I'm not amused.
I’m afraid your process server seems to have a bit too much flair for the dramatic.
Where is my will?
No, I'm alone. But funny, I feel like that the legal team is right here.
Apparently, it's legalese for "Kick me!"
Yes, I noticed a stabbing pain in my back, or rather a stabbing notice in my back pain.
Are you sure you delivered the divorce papers?
Yes Marjorie, I found the divorce papers you left me.
I'd like to speak with President Trump about my new tax bill
I know that divorce papers can be hand-delivered, but this goes a bit beyond that...
911? I was just served divorce papers by a pirate.
No, I don’t know what it says.
Talk about being stabbed in the back by the fake media, right Mr. President?
Hey, Morti, about those separation papers I asked you to serve ...
Your counteroffer is certainly to the point.
Sorry, looks like I got “stuck “with this contract.
Don’t expect any of these demands met until I see two mirrors.

Mr. Luther just stepped out for a few minutes, but he left you a message.

Dear, I can't find the note you left for me.
Looks like we'll be skipping mediation and going straight to triage.
I swear, Hillary, I was always loyal to the campaign!
Honey, remember that Martin Luther guy at the homeowner association meeting who was unhappy with the CC&Rs?
I take it back. I get your point now.
The fact that YOU are THERE... and I am HERE...  does NOT make this a PRE-EXISTING CONDITION!
Yes, I have the divorce papers.
911? I seem to be the subject of ninety-five theses. Could you please send a priest?

Also, I can't read the fine print.
I am looking fir Martin Luther's suster

Sorry honey, but where did you leave the grocery list?
I lost my dagger and you lost your grocery list.
You're divorcing me? I didn't see that coming.
Honey, slowly hang up the phone, and turn around!
I guess she finally got tired of hearing, 'Don't you get the point?'
This is a medical AND a psychiatric emergency.
Hello? 911? I'm not certain, but I think it's both death and taxes.
I got your note and quite frankly, I regard it as a stab in the back.
Well they were smiling in face when all the time they wanted to take my place...
Sorry, I misplaced the "honey do" list again. Did you stick it somewhere?
I forgot, where did you put those divorce papers ?
911? It seems a guy dressed like a monk thought I was the door of his church.
Mr Luther sent me a reminder to call you.
Yes, I understand, I just think there are nicer ways to ask someone for a divorce...
It's just that there is a right way and wrong way to file for divorce.
The President doesn't always respond by Tweet.
His name is Martin Luther and he owes me three indulgences.

My wife dropped off the divorce papers today - it went well.
Well, communication isn't Susan's mother's strongest suit.
Honey, I seem to have misplaced your list of things I should do in order for us to stay together.
Could you send over one of your representatives to twist it a little?

Did you sign them, at least?
Such a pain! I can not find your list!

It's from that employee, Luthor, who refuses to use email.
Hello, Reformation?
Mind if I call you back? I think someone's trying to get hold of me.
On the bright side, she thinks a reformation is still possible.
Yes, yes -- I got the point of your note.
Damn it Martin, I thought you said you were only posting at Wittenberg's Schlosskirche !!!
I can't find the to do list my wife left for me
What say we scratch Sunday’s sermon on Luther and go instead with the Beatitudes?
Yes, I got the ransom note.
Where did you say you left the grocery list ?
I’ve received a few complaints, but nothing I can’t get a handle on.
I'm calling in regards to my late mortgage payment.
The feeling when you discover "hidden fees."
It's a painful story of betrayal.
No I'm not upset with seeing your hotel policy on unruly customers. I'm just angry with how your damn employee delivered it.
The infinite monkeys never had to deal with Windows updates.
Hello, IRS?
No, I didn't find your note. Where did you leave it?
I would like to report an actual backstabbing.
No the chiropractor you recommended was fine, right up to her bill.
Yes ... I'd like to report a 'difference of political opinion' crime.
I took a stab writing a paperback.
Just want you to know I received your backstabbing letter.
She said she was just trying to drive home the point of her frustration with me.
I still don't know why she left.
I am sure it is here somewhere.
Hello, is this the nanny placement agency?
Mother, this time she's given me a honey-do-list-or-else list.
Look Mack I will only sign a cable contract over my dead body.
Sorry, counselor, I can't find our divorce papers anywhere.
Well, she came up with 95 theses of her own.
Is this the Reformation Marriage Center?
I’m having trouble reading it, but I think it’s her 95 Theses for divorce.
I've got 95 theses, Luther, but being a church door isn't one of them!
Yup. Just got the divorce papers. Better than I thought, actually.
Yes, Dear, I found the honey do list. How considerate of you to write it backwards this time.
My wife is missing.
May I take a message?
I get the feeling there's a lot of disagreement going on behind my back.
My landline contract? Yes, I have it here.
I think he meant business.
Yes officer, my wife called me a money grubbing hypocrite and lodged 95 theses in my spine.
No, nothing much new. Why do you ask?
Indulge me.
You didn't indicate, but I'll take your RSVP as a "No".
I do want to settle, but her invective demands are very painful!
I think her therapist told her she needed to be more assertive.
Can you leave a sticky note next time?
This is Ed Luther. My wife, Martina, has posted divorce papers.
I can't. I'm stuck with a 'to do' list that's breaking my heart.
I'd like to schedule an appointment for marriage counselor please!
Yes sir, point well taken!
I just got the memo.
How about I waive service of process and you can just mail the papers to me?
I believe it was Martin Luther. I was standing by the door of the church.
With this new group of hirees, customer service complaints have gone down significantly.
I have a bad feeling about this contract.
I'd like to report a Lutheran.
I was just made painfully aware of the 400th anniversary of Luther's 95 Theses.
If you're not happy, we're not happy.
This wallflower of the month subscription agreement is a killer!
They'll never be able to pin it on me!
How do you expect me to read it I can't even reach it.
Remember how I told you she vowed to really stick it to me?
I want to report a missing document.
She bedrudegly signed the pre-nup.
I can't believe what they're saying behind my back.
I am dying to see the bill. Where did you keep it?
I'd like to report a Reformation, please.
It's all in legalese, except for the knife. That's hers all the way.
I tell you, we have to get rid of that super. He's losing his eyesight.
You call this way subtle to deliver a termination letter ?
OK operator. I took a stab at finding the number myself. Now what?
Honey, have you seen our prenup?
My dramatic acting coach went a “little” bit over when I forgot my lines in class to today.
I'm sick of them taking my ideas and stabbing me in the back with them.
No, I can't read to you over the phone.
Good news sweetheart, they published my review.
It just started suddenly at work this morning.
No Margaret, you can not act as your own process server.
Hi Mom, I’m calling to let you know my final divorce papers were just delivered.
First she sent me a "Dear John " letter; then she stabbed me in the back.
You could've just as easily told me how you felt about my ending our affair to my face, without having to go behind my back!
He said he’d be right back.
911? I'm a Republican and I have a target on my back.
Yeah, so Trump called me "fake news"
I believe she served it personally.
It’s my Wittenberg shirt.
Cancel my subscription, your paper it too edgy and it’s killing me.
Maybe it went to my spam folder.
Operator, I've been cut off.
Republican Senators are starting to play hardball with their Tax Bill demands
Of course not. The 'stole my heart' is not the literal part.
I know you said you would put the paper work where I would remember.
Yes, I did receive your letter, but I haven't read it yet.
My wife just served me with divorce papers.
Maybe taking away her phone wasn't such a good idea.
Actually I'm sort of tied up right now. I'm trying to access a list of divorce demands my wife has sent to me via knife delivery service.
Yeah, I got your point but what's the problem with just texting a Dear John Letter?
No, her complaints are very pointed.
Hi I just back from seeing my ex at her attorneys office.
No. No need to rush. Please send the rest of the documents by regular mail.
It’s okay. I just need someone to read it.
Apparently, my team’s Theses95Complaints.doc went into my junk mail folder, so they found a workaround.
I'm having trouble reading my hospital bill.
I have an aching feeling that the pre-nup was a bad idea.
I asked her if we could come to terms.
I need to report a stabbing on my to do list.
Hello?, cable company, about my latest bill...
And then she hired some ruffian to serve me papers. You know, it really feels like I was . . . thrown under the bus.
You've finally convinced me. I would like to sign up for e-delivery of your correspondence.
You know, I think Jane might be taking this whole Protestant conversion a little to the extreme.
I only asked who was getting custody of the dog.
I'd like to report a doctrinal dispute with my brother, Martin.
How should I know if the blade is surgical grade steel! No, I haven't had a tetanus shot.
I think she may want a divorce.
That's right, Honey, just returned from my time travels to 1517; appears I had a dust-up with a radical cleric.
You could be right, - but I doubt it ws Martin Luther.
You're calling for Mr. Martin Luther? I'm afraid he isn't here right now. May I take a message?
How can I adhere to 'Terms and Conditions' I can't read?
I dozed off, so I never got your message.
No,I've got a lot on my plate just now. I'll read it when I get a chance.
Yes, I've double-checked the filing cabinet.
Honey, did you sign our divorce papers yet?
I was just saying I thought your terms for the divorce were a little harsh, honey.
I guess it was a mistake to think she'd be okay with signing a prenup.
Send help--my wife just completed her to-do list.
Making a list, checking it twice, going to find out whose naughty and nice.
Yeah, you can tell Father Luther, I got his text.
Are you sure it’s a love note..
Hello Equifax? I believe your actions have stabbed me in the back!
Hold on, I’ll get her.
'I'm not too sure but I think she just filed for divorce.'
I can’t read what it says, Officer, but it doesn’t feel like a love letter!
Yes, they approved the legislation through the back channels
If you didn't like the offer, a simple "No" would have sufficed.
Can I change my subscription to digital? Home delivery isn't working for me.
Did you want that list done today?
I guess you're serious about the divorce.
My wife finished her thesis.
I've been losing losing some support at home recently
Come on, Beverly. It was the '80s.
You left me a sharp goodbye note with a cutting remark? Why and where?
I said, where are the divorce papers that my lawyer sent you?
Let my back get to you on that.
Yes, I feel a bit like stabbed in the back when she just now served me the divorce papers
I don't think you got all of the pins out of the new shirt you just gave me for our anniversary.
You are currently number 7 in line. Your call will be answered in approximately 43 minutes.
You're leaving me? Why?
So.....my editor didn't like my article.
Yes, I thought counseling through our Lutheran church was a good idea until Linda was inspired to post her 95 theses about our marriage.
Sorry, I can't make it. My wife just gave me my 'Honey-Do' list.
Good news! She signed the divorce papers.
Hello wifey, did you see my to-do list?
Yes that's what I'm telling you, this manuscript rejection really is the unkindest cut of all.
I just wish you'd give me my to-do list in a friendlier manner.
Are your refrigerators still on sale?
What! Divorce papers? Where did you put them again?
Yes dear, I do take your concerns seriously.
It feels like a stabbing pain between my shoulders.
Honey, where did you leave the shopping list for Christmas?
Yes, I did receive a copy of the proposed tax plan, thank you.
I'd like to report a Martin Luther.
I think I got your message
Yes, literally
I thought she would just leave me a note, instead she stabbed me in the back...
He looks like Martin Luther and is obviously delusional.
A protest is coming...I can feel it.
You left so quickly, did you say you wanted a horse or divorce?
I want to report a missed delivery.
No, so far everyone's been completely loyal.
I just got the news, and it’s not good.
You want my honest opinion? I really don't see your point.
What final reminder note?
Honey, where did you leave my to do list?
I sense a schism in my marriage.com
I'd like to report a bug. I was posting to Pinterest and my iPhone changed my "I" to an A with a weird character and I felt a stabbing pain in my back.
I would describe it as something of a stabbing pain.
Honey? Where did you leave the grocery list?
It appears I'll be dining alone.
There is a deranged monk in my apartment who thinks he's Martin Luther.
I got the point of your message
Helloouch!?
I received the senator's response to my letter regarding net neutrality.
Hello 911, I think my paperwork is killing me.
No, she served the divorce papers in person.
Would you believe she ran out of Post-its ...
Yes, I'd like to report a heresy.
I’ll be late to the card game. Probably wise if I take care of a few things on Edith’s honey-do list.
Yeah, the new boss stabbed me in the back with a letter of termination.
I may have 95 problems, but you're the only one I care about.
Hello Carl? Call the EMTs. I've been served.
He never forgot the grocery list again. He also never remarried.
Hello, I'm calling about the "paperback" murder I ordered.
Aunt Sally’s Christmas letter? Yes, I just got mine. Full of the usual back-stabbing!
I’d like to cancel that order for new golf clubs...
All she complained about was my not paying attention to her, so, no, I don't know why she left.
We're still working on the terms of our divorce settlement....
No no, I think his name was Martin, yes, Martin Luther.
Just calling to say your impale-mail arrived.
Yes Sir! I am fully aware of the approaching deadline.
Literally, your letter is a knife in my back.
I'm think she's serious about the divorce
Existing account.
You've made your point dear, but can you just call my lawyer next round?
No you heard me right, an expected Lutheran attack.
Darling, you know that petition on open-carry dagger laws? Did you put it someplace?
No, I wasn't aware of the pre-existing conditions.
I'd like to report an attempted office fracking.
Marge made it very clear, she won't sign the divorce agreement.
No, I didn't get that message. Could you email it to me?
Urgent care? I'd like to make an appointment. My wife just delivered her own version of the 95 Theses.
I can't confirm as my calendar is not available.
911 ? My wife just served me with divorce papers.
I understand that you want to move away from old-school home delivery but this is ridiculous.
The knife thrower at the circus is also a process server. Guess how I found out.
Et tu Franken?
Do you remember where I left my to do list?
Oh yes, Gladys. But may I suggest that going through your divorce lawyer would have been a more adult way of getting your demands to me.
No officer, it’s literally a back stabbing.
Yes, I did cancel my subscription early. No, I did not read the TOS
Damn that Martin Luther anniversary.
I do think he's a backstabber but he's got an important agenda
Yes, Officer, I said Summon’s stabbed me in the back.
I need to transfer funds.
I've been subpoenaed.
I'm really fine, doc. It just looks worse on paper.
Yes, 911. I think I have been served...
Your message went through.
She made a few cuts.
I'd like to report a homicidal grocery list.
The man you are having an affair with is also a process server ?
Listen, pal, everybody deserves a decent pay stub.
Honey, where did you put the divorce paperwork.
Hello Dear, have you seen your honey do list?
Hard to say, but she took a while getting to the point.
Right? I'll never miss anything ever again with the new facebook post alerts.
Yes, she did, and right on top of my "POST NO BILLS" leaflet to boot!
95, 96, who cares! I'm not a door!!
She'll work here, but she has a few little requests.
My millennial students are getting more sensitive.
You miss one jury summons….
Sorry, gotta' go, have some pressing matters.
If you're calling to ask if pain and suffering related to the current tax bill is covered by Obamacare, press three.
She's not quite there on the draft settlement.
They're aren't kidding -- it really is sub poena.
I have no idea what I’m supposed to remember, but I feel it.
Who knew the preamble was so pointed.
Yes, I can hold...
" a summons would have sufficed".
Back stabbing editorial
If this is your idea of adding insult to injury, think again!
I've got 99 problems and Luther's Theses are all but four of them.
Yeah, my wife wanted to name the dog John Calvin but I insisted on Martin Luther
Taxes really snuck up on me this year.
A simple 'good-bye' would have sufficed, but oh no...she has that nasty way of over-dramatizing.
I'm going to need you to send someone out to read this note for me. My wife told me this is the first draft of our separation agreement, and she thinks she's getting the house.
Yes. I'm quite sure this divorce is final
Can I crash at your place? Apparently my wife got the divorce papers
Why, Angie? Why?
Yes, I’ve been served. She was always big on metaphor.
I just received my fourth notice, do you take credit cards over the phone?
In hindsight, signing the divorce papers would have been less painful.
I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR LIST OF CHORES.
Are you trying to tell me you don't love me anymore?
I am more of a front stabbing person.
dear, where did you put the note I was to read.
There’s something I need
Yes, I've noticed changes since the beginning of Dr. Shapiro's couple therapy. Backache
This guy approaches me and says 'you've been served' but I can't read the notice.
Yeah, about that pre-nup you drew up...
Where did you put my copy of the divorce decree?
all I asked for was a simple postcard!
Hi, yeah, so um, may need to make a few changes to OJ's contract
Tell him someone named Martin Luther left 95 messages.
Lois, I told you to just leave a note to remind me.
My guess is there are 95 divorce demands.
Yes, I received the contract for the hit. When? About a minute ago.
Well I don't know! How do I tell if it's amicable?
Excuse me. I think I just got an Instant Message.
I don't see the point of bickering further.
So you're telling me that my story didn't make tomorrow's front page?
I'm calling to complain about the bill delivery system.
All I said was, "You're just better at shopping."
The Lutherans are coming.
No. No, I didn't get the message.
It appears the hard cover up of the scandal didn't go so well, as the fake news paper back-stabbed him in retaliation.
I thought she was just going to sign it!
List? What list? Guess she must have thrown it somewhere!
She says if I don't agree to all 95, we're going to split.
I felt there was some reason why I was supposed to phone you today.
I'm afraid my wife is in a bit of a pique and has rather forcibly served me with divorce papers.
I need a good lawyer. My wife just decided to play pin-the-divorce-papers-on-her-husband’s back.
It seems like a good deal, but I can’t read the small print.
That's it. Your paper has stabbed me in the back for the last time.
There were some very fine people on both sides.
Yes, I will hold
Rule #1: Don't listen in on my phone calls, #2: Stop giving away the furniture, #3: Never under estimate the lengths.....
My backstabbing brother just served the divorce papers.
keep it short. I have a death notice on my back.
911, I want to report a back pain.
Honey, I promise to never forget the shopping list again.
Don’t you even know you’re supposed to mail a ‘Dear John’ letter?
Looking back, I shouldn’t have married an acupuncturist.
Do me a favor. The next time you send a process server, don't use my ex-wife.
"He's making a list and checking it twice" doesn't work with the kids anymore.
I'd like to order a cold plate of revenge, for 2.
It’s not a total surprise, she did say our divorce papers will be delivered uniquely.
Every day on my upper back. And most of it is spam.
Yes dear, I understand the thrust of your divorce demands.
Your request for a divorce is like a knife in my back.
Yes, honey, I still have the grocery list.
Don't worry, the fine print in the contract will get them.
Honey, do you know where I left my glasses?
Its too painful to forget
Helen, have you seen my "TO DO" list?
Hello I'm calling for the witness protection program. I'm going to need a new name.
No I'm seriosu come quick. i need your help 911.
OK I get the point, I will call the exterminator!!
Yes, I received your statement.
...I know, I know. Please, Helen, where's the list?
Thank you again. This is much more to the point.
Your to late, I have already been served.
She ‘s left, but I don’t know exactly why.
My wife gave me a list of all the chores I'm supposed to do but I can't seem to find it.
He said he wanted his 95 theses to hit home.
You want me to read it back to you?
Honey, where did you leave the shopping list?
Yes, a black hoodie, goes by the name, Luther.
I got served at the office.
Voter registration has gotten a little out of hand.
Good News! We can move ahead with the annulment.
What do you mean I'm insensitive! If I received the notice I would have called you!!
Hello? Yes. Well, it’s about your bill collection service’s methods.
NYPD? I believe I have found your most wanted fugitive just outside our church; calls himself Martin Luther.
I told my lawyer she's a back stabber.
Well, he did have a point, but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what it was.
Pastor Carl? My wife told me about your sermon on the Reformation, which really hit home with me.
I would like to stop looking back on this divorce.
Christie's assures me it is Salvator Mundi
Sorry, again I can't find your shopping list.
I wish he used a post-it.
911? I need help reading a good-bye note.
No, I didn't get past the process server.
Can't make it for dinner, Kislyak. Mueller's team has a list of things they want to discuss. The focus is getting sharper.
Yes, doc, my back pain is rather sharp. I 'll come in after I find the grocery list that my left for me somewhere around here.
I've received my new insurance policy and I'd like to file a claim.
What did the knife look like?
911? A couple of things. First, why do I still have a land line?
I got your prenup.
I'm well aware I've been targeted.
By writing backwards I would read your complaints in bathroom mirror.
No, Senator. I don’t see your name on the “Creep List”.
Of course I got the point of your memo!
Put it this way, he makes a sharper point than some reflex tweeting whiner.
She literally stabbed me in the back with divorce papers.
You are supposed to tape it to my forehead!
Honey, I've been trying to get hold of you. Did you fix my appointment with the doctor?
To be honest doctor, your suggestion she journal her feelings has turned a dark corner.
The note you left? About how your back taxes were killing you?
I reject your offer.
Orange juice and avocados? I'll have to make a second list.
He'd never throw me under the bus! We're the best of friends....
Can you come right away? I've been stabbed in the back by a Reform Protestant.
Did you say, 'Martin Luther Syndrome?'
‘I see, since this is a black and white caption, ‘I won’t be able to tell that the slip is pink?’
Hello, I'd like to order a mirror... make that two. And, do you have same day deliver?
I thought you told me you paid the cable bill.
Does curfew constitute abuse of power?
Honey, where did you put that To-Do list you keep complaining about?
One of our steak knives seem to be missing dear!
Hello. I'd like to speak to my lawyer about my prenup.
I may have stumbled on to some more of Hillary's emails Director Comey.
I get the feeling your wife didn't really want to share the recipe .
911? Could you come over? I have this pain in my back...
"I RECEIVED THE DIVORCE PAPERS FROM YOUR ATTORNEY .... YOU WIN.
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but my bills on my back.
Sorry, I can't find my to-do list.
Hello, 911? I forgot to put a cover page on my TPS report again.
Yes, Mother, I got your note.
Collection service?, Yes, I did get your notice.
I'd like to report an attack on my Constitution.
Good news. Looks like I've got a back-up offer.
Could you explain "bucket list" again?
Yeah! A pink slip is attached to it.
No, I didn't get your note.
Sharon, my marriage annulment offer my attorney sent you, have you seen it?
Yes. Please. Tonite. One adult. No smoking.
Welcome to Caesar Electric, how may I help you?
Most of the backstabbing in our office takes place in the copy machine room
How that damned Luther could confuse me with a church door.....I'll never know!
He was dressed like a monk and called himself Martin Luther. And then he said "you make a better door than you do a window."
I've got an uncanny feeling someone's trying to tell me something.
I'm calling about your ransomwear.
Yes I got your notice, Godfather. But, might I suggest less extreme methods of service?
And my wife says not to forget the milk.
I don't think I can keep this chain letter going.
ok, I'll admit I didn't read the fine print.
We want to cancel our account, we've found a much cheaper way of communicating.
The pink slip finally arrived.
No....no....other.
Help, my kids' wish list is literally killing me.
Legally, can she do that?
They weren't kidding when they said a divorce notice is like being stabbed in the back...
I have the sense Cynthia may have found our letters.
Honey I 'm feeling that knife in the back sensation again could you tell me again what's wrong?
Of course my information is reliable - I have a back-channel source.
Why yes I have several times, but never with an explanation.
Duck not worry, ya’ll are smarter than Donald Trump.
Hello, Madge? Where did you put my to-do list?
Yes, hello, doctor? I feel like the news is trying to kill me.
I'd like to shelve the pre-nup, Larry. There were quite a few parts that she wanted cut and I really don't want lengthy negotiations.
Mom, Shelby left me and the back-stabber ran off with my papers.
I was told your a tough negotiator. I'll accept your final offer.
At work today, somone mistook me for a poster boy.
Sorry but this is not a good time to talk!
But you didn’t put it in the online calendar.
I'm guessing that my bucket was on her list.
I'm pretty sure it was The Media.
Madge? She just left. I'll tell her. I can take a message. She left a note. When will she be back? I'm not sure. Not for a while.
Well, as Pete Seeger said 'education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.'
I took your advice, now I never have trouble remembering.
Yes, I did receive a copy of Trump's tax reform plan.
I lost her on the prenup…and looking back, she never really wanted the wedding at Walmart.
Hello? Berlin Library? That "95 Theses of Martin Luther" exhibit you reported missing?
I think I’m getting a cold.
I understand I was told to watch my back...
My publisher had some concerns.
I know “stabbed in the back” is a harsh phrase but this is some contract.
Strangers keep kicking me, and then pinching me, cursing at me, wet-willying me, tut-tutting at me, giving me wedgies, blowing raspberries... Now that you mention it, Doc, I do feel a little twinge there, yes.
No, Doctor, I was not searching Google.
Your lawyer served me with the papers Dear , are you sure you don't want to reconsider ?
Hey Marty...your marketing plan for the Reformation is lousy. Hove you considered the door of that church over in Wittenberg?
Yes, room service. My wife has just left me, she took my mistress also. And, she called me a backstabbing and cheating lawyer. Huh!
I woke up with an incredible back ache and can't really talk now.
It's a millennial threat--I had to take a selfie in the mirror to read it.
Martin? He left a few minutes ago.
I just discovered a new way to show you that our brother-in-law really does need eyeglasses!
Please connect me to the Vatican. Martin Luther's ghost is back.
OK Elliot, I finally got your point.
Yeah, Martin’s at it again...
I think I found the list.
"No officer" he said " theses not feces".
It just arrived.
Father Martin attended urgent matters this morning and asked if I would deliver his message personally.
We both fooled around behind the other's back.
I'd like a number of a Doctor that specializes in odd circumstances.
Yes, you cured my bursitis, but the bill is ridiculous.
So, we're playing Charades, and my wife wants me to say '500th Anniversary of the Reformation.'
Honey, I can't find my " to do list "
Hello? If I have been stabbed in the back with my life insurance, can I be a guest on "Dateline?"
She's been saying I don't pay enough attention to her so she packed up and left before dawn. No, I haven't seen a note.
I want to file a complaint on my ex-lawyer, Marcus Brutus.
No! I didn't receive your E-Mail!
I’d like to speak to someone about your privacy notice.
Don’t worry. Martin Luther has my back.
She seems to have a long list of reasons to want me dead. Please send that ambulance quickly.
I would have preferred it in an email, but thanks for getting my new health insurance policy to me.
I know you told me to read it but I forgot where you put it.
She’s protesting my indulgences.
Of course I trust you.
Yes, yes I did find the divorce petition you left me.
I just got served divorce papers. I feel like she stabbed me in the back.
My ex-wife has posted her 99 Theses, but I can't read them.
Um.... she stepped out for a minute.
Couldn’t your lawyer have just emailed it?!
I feel like they stabbed me in the back.
When I was a paperboy, I would have been THRILLED to get an extra dollar, during the holidays.
Got your point. I'll sign the decree.
Yeah, I got the contract on my piece.
Any chance you misinterpreted the grant specifications?
Hello Police, Before my wife ran off with her tennis instructor, she’s left me a message, and I think it is against the law.
I acknowledge the familiar look, walk, and quack. But do they code like a duck?
Yes we have teenagers.
I'd like to report a scathing, backstabbing article.
Hi mom, I'm getting divorced.
Whats my pain level between one and ten
Sorry, busy and stressed. Wife posted her 95 theses on me...
Just be glad your wife isn't Lutheran, Bill. I've got a to-do list that would blow your mind.
I'd like to report a betrayal.
Things at work? Same ol', same ol'.
Yeah? Well, I thought your lawyer was quite rude.
I think Marna means it this time.
Couldn’t you have just posted my “to do” list on the refrigerator?
Why is it when I talk to you I always feel yu are accusing me of something
I can now say she's got my back with the divorce proposal.
Since when is emergency calls from landlines not accepted?
No, I can’t read it. But I have a painful feeling it’s a “Dear John” letter.
Yes, I did read the fine print, but I still want to cancel my cable service
I'm going to be late Honey. The intern needs to work on his filing.
I am certain that there has been a miscommunication regarding my job description
Yes, Dear, I'll be sure to bring the divorce papers.
She didn't say no, exactly, to a prenup.
She has served me with a divorce petition and it really hurts
It came special delivery.
'Where did you put the shopping list?"
Hello, Room Service? I have a complaint about my bill.
Yes hi, I'd like to file some complaints about the billing process.
We can't meet your demands because they are not legible.
I know it’s overdrawn sir. Yes, she was a little upset. Well sir, I had it written down but...
Honey, have you seen my bills?
The acupuncturist's bill came.
It would be dangerous to receive any more postings.
Sorry, I'll be late. I've just gotten stuck with my wife's honey-do list.
My insurance papers DO say it's a work related injury!
" Do you have a copy of their demands? I seem to have misplaced mine".
Of course I didn't read the prenup; I was madly in love with him.
Yes, Dr., she said had I listened she would not have had to resort to Lutherian Measures..
Yes, Doctor, there are 95 of them. Nailed to my back, that's right. I agree, I think there has been some mistake.
A divorce proposal agreement? What are you talking about?
Yes, a stabbing pain. . . . I believe it's 95 theses.
I'll get BACK to you about the list.
You know that prenup you helped me write?
I'm just calling to let you know that I got your message ...
Room service? Can you send up a different Bible? My wife's taking this Reformist version a little too literally.
He said his name was Luther and he forgot his glasses.
Margie come home!! Bobby's homework is to emulate Martin Luther and he's gotten carried away!
I'm telling you, Linda, it's not safe...someone put a contract out on me.
I would like to cancel my subscription.... Yes... I’ll hold.
... 95 reasons I hate you.
She delivered her terms. There are a few sticking points.
No, no, my fault, and yes, I did get your final demand letter
No, I haven't had a chance to read through it all - but I gather this is the end.
I criticized her art and she let me have it with a list of complaints.
Yes I do feel like cable company is stabbing me in the back.
Wait until you read my revised will. It's a backstabber.
She served the divorce papers in the way I expected.
Does it count if they serve the subpoena behind my back?
No, I'm sorry, she just went out.
In the future, this message will be a nasty tweet to my smartphone. But for now, this will have to do.
The coop board's demands are going to kill this deal.
I know she must have left a note somewhere...
How did your ex-wife deliver her divorce decree?
I say, Old Man, save the bloody work memos for the office!
It's about our delivery boy.
Yes I got your note and understand you are very angry and not coming back!
Mom? It looks like Dad was right?
Did you get my note?
It's death by a thousand, but it's been folded into one stab in the back. So it's a lot worse than it looks.
Apparently one of my coworkers fancies himself a swashbuckler!
I just feel like my credit report just stabbed me in the back.
Can't make poker tonight, Phil. Jean's pretty serious about taking a stab at whittling down the "To-Do" list.
No, he really insisted it was a non-disclosure contract!
Why yes, I am Lutheran, but what's that got to do with it?
May I speak to a living person?
I've got a backlog of things I'm dealing with.
That is NOT how you text someone, Johnson!
Police?, My wife has disappeared and I need an ambulance.
Hello Amazon, I have a complaint about how you bill for your new "key service".
Mommy?
I don't think I can get it off without ripping it, and my wife says it's important and the doctor should see it
No, what shopping list?
He was jealous of my indulgences.
Gosh, no. I didn't see anything. If it happened, must have been out of the room.
I think it says kick me
Customer service? We have a question or two about your assembly instructions...
Don't worry about this deal. I've read the fine print; I've got my back covered, and I'll take a stab at it.
Why yes, my ex-wife did deliver the divorce papers, but they are not accessible at this moment
Can you please explain to Martin Luther that I'm not Dan Brown?
911, what’s your emergency ? I wanted you file a missing persons report. What’s the name of the person, sir? Her name is Acapethaua. Can you spell that for me, please. Yes, is A C A...... you still there? Hello?
I’m killing the script
Yes, customer service? I'd like to file a complaint about your subpoena delivery service.
I have that strange feeling of having theses pinned to my back.
911 what's your emergency?" - "My wife wants a divorce...
She said she left a letter outlining her grievances but I can't find it."
Well doc, its a long story, but after years of being stabbed in the back by my wife the divorce papers are finally signed.
Thank you. It's good to know that you have my back.
Hi, Does my policy cover Back-U-puncture ?
No, I haven’t received the divorce papers.
Sorry, I am just not seeing your point.
She found out I was messing with the ladies.
He's still mad and now he's found religion.
Don't worry Martha, I'll sign the divorce papers as soon as I can find them.
I've been home all week and even checked the mailbox. I think my wife forgot about the divorce papers.
I'm sorry but she just stepped out for a minute.
Look, just send someone over, okay! My boss will be even more upset if the contract is smudged with blood.
Exposing my colleagues was a really bad idea.
You said that last time. You said, “He’ll get back.”
I think the gist is he feels we are overindulging his sister.
Hello John. My wife just delivered the divorce papers. Should I come by your office to have them signed and notorized?
We decided who's gonna take care of it.
I'd like to report a crime. I and my screenplay have been stabbed in the back.
Your note was just like stabbing me in the back!
Next time can you please fax the contract instead of having Mack deliver it?
No, I didn't read the fine print.
My wife left me a note to call you.
I don’t know, she just said something about 95 theses or something.
I think she's trying to tell me something.
No, I obviously didn't read the terms and conditions.
Mr. Weinstein is not happy with your article.
The wife told me to tell you that perfumed love letters are bulletin board material.
No, officer, not a "honey-do" list....more like a list of grievances...
My time is up, I think.
"Hi sweetheart. I know you want a divorce because of my lack of attention. But where did you leave the divorce papers you wanted me to sign?
I'd come, but I'm stuck with this "Honey-Do" list.
No, thank you. I've already bled at the office.
She said it was either this or alimony.
Once I accepted that I had to give her half of everything, it wasn’t so painful.
I can't talk now, something has come up.
Hi Sam. Can you come on over and help me with the note Mabel left for me?
He didn't respond well when I rejected his list of demands
Yes I got your letter, but I'm not crazy about the method of delivery.
Hello, my wife has recently suggested I make an appointment to update my will.
I just got served by my ex
I think I’ve been stuck to take one for the team.
Where did you put it? I can't find the credit card statement anywhere.
I can't use the cell phone, I clicked "disagree" after actually reading the T & Cs. Well..apparently that's not an option anymore.
Yes Officer, my attacker said I had "violated the contract."
Hello 911? Can you send an ambulance, my wife just served the divorce papers.
I can’t tell you how important this is to my wife.
You were supposed to take the contract with you.
OK, honey, I agree. You can have the house.
Well, I took my broken iphone back to the store with my service agreement and the rep gave me a very clear demonstration of what the contract meant.
Does the ambulance service accept Visa? I may have just lost my wife's insurance coverage with the divorce filing.
You heard me right, Martha. It won't get off my back.
At least an hour. She's putting on her Stilletos.
Isn't it a little late to be calling about your new terms of service when they've already stabbed me in the back?
Sorry dear, I can't find the shopping list you gave to me.
I didn't know she could serve divorce papers herself
Yes, Connie, I found the divorce papers.
No,we’re going to divorce counseling. She been pretty fair about everything.
Hey Marty. She just served me the divorce papers.
Martin Luther? No, and I am not a distant relative....
The subpoena just adds insult to injury.
You know how my partner always says 'I got your back'?
Yes Miriam, I just received the Divorce papers you sent. And I might add, I also got the two previous documents you sent, wrapped around bricks & thrown at my window.
Well, she didn't exactly sign the divorce papers.
I have a complaint. When I received the robo-call from you people, and screamed that I will only deal with a human...I had "human voice" in mind. Again, your company response is a big disappointment.
It's supposed to be pay _or_ die!
Yeah, still can't find this week's "Peacefully Dealing With Coworkers" bulletin...
No my love, I haven't lost the to do list.
I'm sorry, I've stopped taking messages, period.
Where did you say you left a note telling me what to do for the umpteenth time?
The wireless bill arrived.
Sorry, I'm not interested in reformation.
The boss had my back all right
After the Experian hack we stopped using email.
Yes, I got your point that I need to sign the divorce papers.
I read what I could in a double mirror. Your prose is still impenetrable.
The O'Jays were right.
I feel that the Twitter trolls are taking their game to a new level.
Yeah, hon? Where did you leave that to-do list again?
If you can eliminate line item 3 then I can live with it.
No, I cannot see what it says. She took the mobile phone too. Her only comment was that I should come with a manual. I figure it’s last week’s honey-do list, a Dear John letter, my insurance note, or that manual. Can you hurry?
It seems he has a list of demands. Yes, he had a German accent.
What makes you think I will remember where your list of demands are if I just sit down in the high back chair?
Do you speak German?
APPARENTLY, YOUR CLIENT, (MY FUTURE WIFE) WISHES TO RENEGOTIATE OUR PRE - NUP!!!
I'm going to have to call you BACK!
Tina really stabbed me in the back with these divorce papers.
I can't find the honey-do list.
Give me a momwnt, I've got to find my notes!
Doctor, I have a stabbing pain in my back.
I’ve been indicted.
911? I have been struck by a poem.
Mom, she never talked about a list of grievances. She just said I was insensitive and had no real feelings for her.
I think they're serious about the 'no wall hangings' clause.
Hello, police? I'd like to report a murder.
it looks dope, but how do I change my shirt without dying?
He said he was Martin Luther and that he had a few suggestions.
It was a bloody divorce. She really stuck it to me.
I'll get back to you as soon as my wife steps in; I seemed to have misplaced the papers
Remind me what was on the second page again.
I received your statement of betrayal, but I'm having trouble reading it.
Hello, NSA? When you say "we have America's back", what exactly do you mean?
All right! I will check the agree button.
I would call it a nagging backache.
She didn't have the sense to put a stamp on it and mail it!
The divorce papers were delivered
Hello, Did you just send me a back dated eviction notice?
outch
really, this reminder wasn't necessary, I never forget your alimony.
I can't find your note dear. Is that an airport PA system I hear?
Hello, I need to report a very bias pollster.
I can’t seem to find my divorce papers, my wife said she pinned them up somewhere...
You think you're back hurts?
I’d love to play poker but my wife’s made a real point about the shipping list.
I have a feeling she's getting ready to accuse me of grabbing her by the yearbook.
I don't understand how you attached the preexisting condition paperwork while it was still in midair.
They posted my new assignment.
Hi, I'd like to cancel my subscription to The New Yorker...
Hello Xfinity., am I out of contract yet?
I still can't figure out why people keep kicking me.
Yes, the divorce papers were served a little while ago.
I'm stuck with the mortgage.
Counselor, I have just received my wife's list of grievances.
Yes, their service has been fine so far but their contract really sticks it to you.
No, I haven't had a chance to review the terms of the divorce papers I was recently served with.
Where's my thesis? Is it you?
It feels like I’ve been hit with a subpoena.
Yeh. I got a to-do list too.
First, I'm on the"No Call Registry". Second, I am telling you person-to-robot that I resist your high-pressure sales model. I will be sticking with my landline.
Yes dear, I have the shopping list.
Poor cartoon but add this to the Lincoln cartoon. "...Ahem!" after the first line and "Mmmm that's good...think I'll go with the short version this time." next to the third picture.
I don't think the neighbors like our proposal.
We'll accept the policy and all exclusions for ill health.
My wife just served me divorce papers.
Police? I’d like to report a missing knife.
My wife's lawyer just delivered the divorce papers
Hi, I'd like to order some take-out.
Yea, my wife said she'd "kill me" if I didn't run her errands today. I think she's serious.
Attorney McStabby, please. Yes, I will hold.
No I'm not calling because I'm upset . I know business is business .
There is a cutting back story.
Yes, I KNOW my name is Martin Luther but......
She just stepped out
It's better to use double sticky tape.
Yes Sir, I got the memo.
The health section of today’s paper does an excellent job explaining back pain.
He rejected the terms of the contract a tad aggressively.
It wasn’t exactly a good-bye note…she calls it her 95 theses on how I expected her to indulge me.
Yes kids, as of today, it's back to the old landline!
Your Last Acupuncture Worked So Well, I Do Have Another Pinched Nerve.
She definitely wants a divorce.
What can I say? She hired an aggressive process server
She found out she was related to Luther on Ancestry.com
Look, Barbara, I only paid for the one indulgence . . .
Hey, I know you got my back... but, don't you think I'd know if I was served a subpoena?!
Honey, I realize I won't lose it this way, but I can't read it.
Yes. Passion rekindled.
Sorry sweetheart, but I can't find your honey-do list anywhere.
No, I'm not Catholic, so it doesn't really hurt.
At least Martin Luther nailed his demands to an inanimate object.
Mom, I think I was just served with divorce papers.
Hey, Joe. My wife left a note pinned to my shirt but I can't read it. Can you come over and read it for me?
Instead, couldn't you just have texted and/or emailed me?
Me? Roughly the size of a chapel door.
I wanted to put it behind me.
I thought I told you to send the suggestions by email!
Cable company? There somthing wrong with my TV’s 3-D feature.
Oh. I thought I just needed to dial M.
But... unlimited data.
Yes..... I'm responding to the message you left earlier........ ?
It was 5:30 in the morning and you had rambled on for eighteen pages--FRONT AND BACK!
The only problems is that it's written in red ink.
That's right, officer. Her name is Martina Luther.
They said, "This is my last chance to sign for the 'extended warranty'!"
Are you saying I really can't miss where the shopping list is?
No, 'sticking point is a stab in the back' is not a metaphor.
Then she yelled, "This Reformation starts now!" and ran out the door.
Martin...can we talk about the indulgences?
Mr. Grunwald, I brought your report on office politics to read at home. I want to see you in my office first thing tomorrow.
Hello, 911 Emergency Services? A sharp bowie knife is sticking multiple "to-do" lists into my backbone! Please come quickly!
How am I supposed to read your to-do list?
No, I haven't seen today's headlines.
I'm calling to make an appointment for back pain.
Yes, I got your urgent message
Enough said, I'm not talking any longer.
I'm got a little behind with my To-Do List.
She said she'd watch my back.
No, Walter, I won't review your exam again. The grades have already been posted.
Mandrake the Knife Thrower rejected our latest offer.
Sorry to bother you at work, dear, but where did you put today's paper?
It's feels like she literally took a page out of the book on back-stabbing.
I'm calling to report a stabbing.
Honey, that life insurance salesman finally got me!
Hello, 911. They've posted their theses online and now on my back; yes, they're disputing our abuses and indulgences of power.
Sorry I have to hang up, my phone bill is a stab in the back.
I'd like to speak with the acupuncturist.
As expected, I got served with the divorce papers today.
yeah honey, the new job as a tack board is great
As if stabbing me in the pack wasn’t painful enough, she also served me with divorce papers.
Note to self, send more flowers
Doctor- May I have an appointment for tomorrow?
Yes, Honey, he's here". " Yes, he does seem to have a few questions about the contract.
I haven’t gotten your message yet...
I'm telling you that is not how you post it on e-bay!
911? Please send someone who can read cursive.
Yes, this an emergency. Luther, yes, Luther is my name.
I'll call you back. I can't reach the knife.
On the bright side, he gave me a insurance policy to go with it.
Waiting for my call to be answered could be terminal !
No, I haven’t read the note yet, let me call you back.
I would like to report a crime.
She says I'm too indulgent. I think she's too demanding.
Yes, I'm reverting to analog communications.
I've looked everywhere, and I can't find the document. I've got a feeling it's nearby, but I just can't put my finger on it.
You remember when you told me to expect an eviction notice? I guess I didn't take the warning seriously enough.
Yes, I'd like to report a homicide note...no, I can't hold

This policy is all coverage, no protection.
She delivered the divorce papers today but I haven't been able to read them yet.
There is no red to remind me that I have a lot to do.
. . . and I think it's a ransom note from my chiropractor.
Hey, uh, I think the flower picture is fake.
Hello 911? I’ve been stabbed! Also, I’ve lost my wife’s “to-do” list.
I don't know where she went. She said she left a note, but I haven't seen anything.
I'd consider the demands your man delivered, but I haven't been able to read them.
Have you seen the mail since our fight Honey?
OK Dear, can we cut through the paperwork I’ll sign the divorce papers
The kid playing Martin Luther at today's Reformation pageant missed the door and I got the 95 theses instead.
Don't worry honey, your reminder for your 't.t.d.' list was quite clear!
Honestly, I thought acupuncture was just needles.
I've been served with divorce papers
Of course I read the fine print.
Little Caesars, I would like to order a pizza.
I've been stabbed in the back, and I'm pretty sure it was by a Lutheran.
Hello, room service? I was just served papers that I didn't order.
What do you mean you put out a contract on me?
We sent the really gifted ones to an advanced incubator.
Susan, your divorce lawyer really stuck it to me.
Hello,911,no, no, no, don't put me on hold...
Some sort of thesis he said, but I haven't had a chance to read it.
My back is killing me. I'll call you later.
‘They heard you were a quack.’
My back pain proves I have feelings, but I can't find Your list of grievances.
Yes, the divorce is final. She signed the papers this morning.
The prenup is signed but I can't seem to reach it.
Yes, about your lawyer,,,,
She just posted a list of grievances.
Well, let's just say the players' union wasn't quite ready to come to terms.
My lawyer says it will make me look more sympathetic.
Well honey, I guess giving your mother a list of reasons she’s like an itch I can’t scratch was a mistake.
911? This time a backstabbing spouse serving divorce papers is an emergency.
She stuck me with the amendment's text, and I realized that guns are not the only way to fight back.
I don't feel good moving forward.
Can you connect me with Backstabbers Anonymous ?
Hi Monica, I can't meet you for a drink tonight, I'm afraid my wife suspects something.
Yes, your demands have been posted and duly noted. A little heads up might have been nice, however.
Well at least thing time the backstabber left an explanation
I dunno Mom, I think Cheryl's pretty serious about the divorce. Can I call you back?
Look, officer. Whether it rises to the level of the unibomber manifesto is beyond my pay grade. But it hurts, nonetheless.
They claim I violated the terms of our non-disclosure agreement, if I understand the point of this message.
Dad died. He wouldn't say if he had a will.
Hello 911? My son has changed his name to M. Luther and posted some Theses relating to his allowance which I think you should know about.
She claimed I had no backbone - luckily for me, she was right.
Her response to the divorce papers just arrived.
No, Mother. She did NOT agree to the pre-nup.
911? I? think I? have a message for your people. It was hoped that you’d find me dead.
So I forgot the grocery list. For this you stab me in the back?
I know you said you left a list, but I can't find it anywhere!
I get the point, you want a divorce.
Yeah, I don't think the client likes our contract stipulations....they kept mentioning all the "indulgences".
How do I know we're being evicted? I've just got a feeling.
I have a feeling my policy doesn't cover "insurance representative-induced injuries."
Honey , I still can't find the shopping list .
I don't know, I can't read it.
I’d like to report a sighting of Martin Luther and his new 95 theses.
It’s my to do list. Apparently she’s taken advise from one of her backstabbing friends.
Yes dear, I got your list
Indeed. This case is proving hard to pin down.
Apparently my wife thinks I am behind with my 'to do' list.
The Instant Messenger Beta Test that failed.
The Bishop says I’m not Lutheran enough.
Yes John, my wife abandoned me, she said she left a letter somewhere to explain she doesn’t love me anymore because I’m unemotional and behave like I don't feel anything, but I really can't understand why
You told me I would be portrayed as the hero!
This landline contract is a killer.
lawyers
Something tells me my payment is late.
Twenty minutes? Okay, I guess. If I don't answer right away, tell them to keep trying.
I know, but she wasn’t a Martin Luther.
I think we need to rewrite the prenup.
It’s that damn history teacher! They’re studying Martin Luther and he’s into “hands-on” pedagogy...
Out of the blue she serve me divorce papers today! After raising three children and everything I've given her---It was a real stab in the back.
Sorry, but can you send me another copy of the contract? I an having trouble seem reading this one.
Imagine, he invites me to this very fancy sushi place, and he sticks me with the bill!
Well, at the moment, I’m having a hard time reading the fine print of my life insurance policy.
You back-stabbing witch - I READ the damn alimony provisions, ya know . . .
I am sorry, you She just left, can I take a message?
Oh, I got the point.
So it turns out getting stabbed in the back isn’t all that bad.
Is that with or without the tip?
Sorry, I think my wife may have a few things for me to do.
People have been kicking me in the same elaborate manner all day long. So how was your day?
Nope. I've never heard of Putin.
So...my wife just gave me divorce papers.
... well she has been talking a lot about divorce recently, maybe it's something to do with that.
Room service, please.
Yes. I did receive your letter.
You thought YOU had it bad with your scarlet letter.
Yes, doctor, I'm sticking to my diet religiously.
This is Tom in room 808. I need schedule a dry cleaning pickup for tomorrow.
I'd like to report a back stabbing.
The devil's on my back, and she wants a divorce.
I can tell you all about it when I have absorbed it thoroughly.
Yes, I'd like to order take-out.
I got your love note.
I had to sign for it but I haven't had time to read it yet.
You said this was going to be a friendly divorce!
I'm sure I haven't seen it. When did you send it?
I'm not sure what her latest emands are yet, but the negotiations have racheted up somewhat.
Louise, you know that list of complaints Jimmie's been compiling?
Hey your right about letting my wife in on the life insurance.
They make some good points.
She stabbed me in the back mom...more than you know.
She had something important to tell me, but was running late for her group therapy.
Goodell: Yes, Jerry, I received a copy of the lawsuit about my job...Thanks.
Can I call you later? I'm backed up with paperwork.
I suspect the bleeding has only just begun.
My morning work prediction has been received. Thank you.
She either left a detailed motive or an alibi.
So your really going to stick it to me this time?
I just received my divorce settlement demands, can we schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience?
Well, I assumed he meant MLK Jr., if I had known he meant the original Martin Luther I wouldn't have agreed to be the Church door.
No, ma'am, they're not just as good as safety pins.
I get the point, Dear.
Yes, SAS legal department? My son just filled out your application form, and I'd like to suggest that you rethink the wording of your terms and conditions where it says, "stab if you agree".
No, I didn't sign it and don't need the legal department, would you please just send an ambulance?
Sorry but I can't read the fine print on the contract right now.
I expected you to deliver your poison pen letter in person, not by UPS.
What poster??
Mom, I have a note for you from my boss.
The news of my death is all fake.
With ad revenue at an all-time high, Mr. Gardner still had to sell the shirt off his back to keep the art review in publication. "Well," he reasoned. "At least I'll stay warm."
Yeah, I have my layoff notice right here.
Well, thank God it's not mightier than a sword.
She called it, "The Edict of Nance."
It's a 1099. I've been hired.
I laughed when she threatened to serve me papers - then it went downhill fast.
Ooh, you cut me, daddy!
Can't go golfing this weekend, Herb Ann gave me a honey- do list.
Honey, remember when I warned you that Circus performer tenants always complain about their apartments?
He thinks he's Martin Luther
I want to report a stick-up!
Believe me, you can still make a killing in print.
It's partly my fault. I told her if she couldn't decide where to go on vacation she should just throw a knife at the travel brochure.
My wife left me and I have no idea why.
Maid Marian hated the counter offer.
Honey, does "call 911" come before or after the rest?
Hello, Paul? I thought I signed up for the Cut Your Bill in Half program...
Hello, it's Mr. Bill Board here. I believe I've been stabbed.
Not tonight, Don. These deadlines are literally killing me. Go figure.
Where did you leave the divorce papers, again?
Honey, where did you leave that to do list ?
I'm especially worried about the Counter-Reformation.
We were having a discussion about al fresco or full service for dinner tonight and then “whammo “.
No, you've caught me at a great time.
I'll review the contract just as soon as the bandage arrives.
No, the last two digits are eight two.
Yes, I received your notice. No, I haven't been able to get to it quite yet. Perhaps when my wife gets home?
I would like to report that someone just pegged 95 theses on my back and I am not even Catholic.
I ran into a Martin Luher impersonator going into church today.
I just got the non-disclosure contract.
But it's not a deed – it’s a title.
On the other hand, at least it wasn't a kick in the guts.
Uh...yes, I'm quite sure she has reviewed the prenuptial.
As if stealing the company away wasn't enough...
Good news, I finalized my will. bad news you're not in it
She said NOW our divorce is final
The kid evidently thought the chaperone said 'tale.' And 'honky.'
Honey, would you text me that shopping list? I can't read the copy you left at home.
Yea I got naked so what?
Martin thinks our counteroffer is low.
Classic FBI, stab a colleague in the back and leave a vindication!
Hold on a sec - this text message is marked 'urgent.'
I'm getting this sense that I'm forgetting something.
If I could read what it says, I wouldn't be calling for help.
And cheese and milk TOO?
I thought we were keeping this amicable, Susan.
Hello Jim. Thank you for forwarding my divorce decree!
Should I be able to feel it?
What honey-do list?
Hi Honey -- taking a stab at your To Do List so I can get these items off my back.
I got 95 Theses, but a knife ain't one... It is, however, the reason I'll miss work today.
Hun, where did you put that list of all the people who backstabbed me?
Can I tell you about a few items that aren't on the menu?
The betrayal and demands are outrageous and you did not even have the courtesy of using you own knife.
I asked you to add footnotes
I heard.
Apparently chiropractors don’t take I.O.U.s.
When she said roses are red, I didn’t think she meant the blood dripping down my back.
Honey, where did you say you put that "honey-do"list?
Yes, she's gone. She had a hard time sharing her thoughts with me.
Your lawyer delivered the divorce decree.
Yes, but your email clearly states you would indemnify me!
911? I have just been murdered by a poison pen letter opener.
Look, I don't care how old Grandpa Brutus is. I think it's time we taught him to text.
I'm calling about your bulletin.
I'll have to cancel golf tomorrow - my wife reminded me that I had agreed to go to the flower show with her.
I did receive your demands but I haven't gotten around to them.
“Put the next notice in my head because my backs already full”.
And then I finally got the point.
I changed my mind and would like to add voicemail.
Never mind. Just send up room service.
I’ve just gotten the divorce papers. What’s the next step?
Where did you put the shopping list I don't see it anywhere
I understand that you had your reasons, but it's still not cool.
Actually, I am quite unhappy with my current internet and cable contract.
On a positive note, she gave me 48 hours to accede to her demands...
Honey, I’ll be coming home early from the conference.
I think they're serious."
My wife would like to cancel our remaining 'Marriage Counseling' sessions.
Please send it in an email next time.
Hello. Father O'Brian? There's a guy who claims to be Martin Luther in the neighborhood. He just left here. If he shows up at Church, do not turn your back on him!
I've narrowed it down to two theories, Doris: Either she suspects something, or she ran out of space on the bulletin board.
“Mother wants me to look for a job”.
Yes I''ll definitely save the date!
Pirates keep kicking me in the butt everywhere I go.
No problem. I haven't gone yet.
Dear, I promise I won’t forget to pay that bill
How am I supposed to see your "To-Do List" when you stuck it there?
Sir, I promise you my loyalty.
Hello, 911? This is Martin Luther. Can you send an EMT to my house who can read Latin?
You're mad, but there's nicer ways to deliver divorce papers!
I wish for once she’d just tell me what to wear.
No, what shopping list?
When will I get the @&$?#*! signed divorce agreement
I've received the paperwork for the mobile, and I've decided to stick with the landline for a while longer.
Honey, tell me again why you feel like Martin Luther.
What's your point, Emily?
Monsignor, I need to buy a plenary indulgence right away.
"No, that's the strange thing. They didn't even say what this is all about".
Honey....where did you put the shopping list??
What time is the movie? I can't find my paper.
I don't like the smug, elitist vibe I'm getting from your think-tank, Jennings.
My assistant just angrily quit by Post-it note.
Yes, it was my friend. That's right, lyrics. Pretty sure it's the O'Jays.
Of coarse I read it, but that's not the problem
I'd like to complain about your process server...
I'm afraid I won't be able to make the court date.
I was right-sized this afternoon. How was your day?
I'd like to refute the third of my wife's 95 theses.
Yes, it's a dull, aching pain. I began feeling it shortly after leaving the bank.
Work is killing me. How are you doing?
She tells me that I need to change, but she is never specific.
No, no, I am pretty sure. Her terms look quite benign.
My new carrier INSISTS I use a landline phone.
I don't know if I've been served or severed.
Hi - who can I talk to about getting an email address?
I have a few questions regarding my mortgage.
Does your yogi do house calls?
You know that divorce settlement? I'll sign.
goddammit how many times do I have to tell you I am NOT that Martin Luther!
About finding a job, I get your point dear!
Mr. Johnson, i was served today
Barb; your lawyer has served me with the divorce papers and your expected settlement...
I’d like to show him my 95 feces...
Honey, where did you say you left the shopping list?
Hello mom, I think Fran wants a divorce....
When you said "Donald isn't as good a friend as I thought," I didn't expect he was a "back-stabber"
I know you said this was on deep background, but it still isn't what I expected.
She told me I wasn't worthy of a postage stamp.
Anyway, my wife's attorney spots me leaving the house, and, yadda, yadda, yadda, I get served with divorce papers!
Hello 911, Mr. Luther missed the door!
I'm sorry, I really can't hold.
There seems to be something stuck to my back, can you come up here and tell me what it is?
I thought we were friends and you just stabbed me in the back and left a written apology?
I told her if she put all of her grievances in writing, it wasn't backstabbing...
She doesn’t seem comfortable with the terms of the agreement.
I'm sorry. It's back ordered.
Wait til you see what's on Line 2.
Yes, I saw the news article accusing me of being a sexual predator and so I'm calling to resign effective immediately.
Yes, dear. When your Mother left she gave me your note.
Look, "Herr Luther", or whoever you are, those 95 theses are not anywhere around here and you are beginning to be a pain in my back!
Frankly, their rejecting my proposal felt like a real stab in the back.
You want to put a pin in that idea?
I take it the contract has no wriggle room.
I said no backsies.
Hello, 911? Finally! 10th try. Operator, I had an accident posting my emergency contact numbers....
Dead Letter Office, please....
What're you talking about? No one here's been served divorce papers.
Only 95 but it still hurts.
Yes Officer, she's threatened to kill me if I don't meet her demands.
Sorry, I don't think Marie will be home this evening.
911? I’ve been manifestoed.
It's the new tax code.
So, you've got my back?
I have an aching feeling I'll find the grocery list soon, honey
Your delivery method is a little odd.
Um, can I order a pizza?
My wife just served me divorce papers.
You make a good point.
The divorce papers were served but there is one big sticking point.
0kay, okay. I got the point!
Yes, I do have eyes in the back of my head, inherited from my mother.
I dunno Shirley, you could've just mailed me the divorce papers.
Call me paranoid, but I don't trust these guys.
No, it hurts even more when I try to sit down and relax.
I’m calling about your diet.
I suspect it's a copy of the Versailles Treaty.
I got the raise, but it came with some conditions.
No, I don't back the fake news reported.
It may be a Lutheran tradition but it's really hurting my back.
Hello, Better Business Bureau? I’d like to report what I feel is undeserved harassment from a collection agency.
Please take me off your distribution list. It's Theo Church... Yes, Theo, with an "o".
Yes, I'm feeling the effects of excessive violence in the media.
Did you know Martin Luther is now a killer zombie?
My friend, Martin Luther, seems to have missed the point.
Bob? This is Ralph. How about coming over & taking this knife out of my back. You may need ut again.
It feels like I've been stabbed in the back.
Where did you stick the grocery list?
The twins are home from art school and they have a list of demands.
I seem to have misplaced it.
Et tu, Lorraine?
Need your help, Doc. No one told me the side effect of not voting.
Can you believe it? She called me an insensitive dolt then packed up and left.
I know I'm supposed to do something for you but I can't find your note.
She served me the divorce papers today.
But, Marilyn, why did you address it to my wife?
No, not Van Dross.
Let's just say he used an unusual method to post his manifesto.
Dad, you were sorta right when you said that studying journalism would eventually bite me in the back side.
I'm calling about the Explanation of Benefits I received...
I'm pretty certain I start Monday.
Where is the tripple mirror I ordered? Yes, I have prime.
"Looking back, I didn't realize the "Honey-do list" she gave me last year, was so important to her.
As she was leaving she said that she left me a note, but I can't find it.
Sir, when you sign your name, you are also agreeing to all of the terms included in the easily accessible fine print.
Yes dear, I got your note about my Mom's visit this weekend.
Did you email or snail mail the divorce decree?
Listen, gotta go. I just got a pointed reminder of what's on the honey-do list today.
Darling, have you seen my honey-do list?
I got served with divorce papers from my wife and the process server was a brute.
We need to talk about my property tax assessment.
Uncle Martin dropped off his thesis.
NICE OF YOU TO CALL AND GIVE ME HEADS-UP THAT YOU ARE STABBING ME IN THE BACK
Look Doc, there's got to be a better way for you to send me my prescription!
Even so, I still love Facebook.
Please remind me what you would do if I lost it?
I need an ambulance. I've been stabbed in the back by my partner, Martin. Martin Luther.
don't pick the daisies is it then
What do you mean, take a stab at it?
Please tell Mr. Sharkey that although I got his new loan-refinancing note, read it carefully in the mirror and agree to all its provisions - I'm having some ongoing problems with regard to signing on the dotted line. Thank you.
Well, we have started the new 360 Feedback program...
No, the paper delivered wasn't wet or late and I can't tell if any parts are missing.
She didn't even leave a note.
It's not that I didn't receive the eviction notice...
They are offering me points on the back end.
I don’t want to sound overly dramatic but her Dear John letter sure feels like a stab in the back.
I'll get right back to you.
Page 6 is back and sharp as ever.
Honey, have you seen our divorce papers anywhere?
It must have been one of the millennial executives, they attached a confessional think piece.
Just got your note, but haven’t had a chance to read it yet.
Well, Honey, HR is serious this time about us picking a health plan before the deadline.
Honey can you come pick me up? They took my company car and gave me my walking papers.
I have a stabbing pain in my back, Doctor. It began just after my wife asked for a divorce.
Hi hon, I can't find the shopping list.
Martin Luther's done it again.
My son has some very uncomfortable ideas about what he should do with the journal writing he does in his therapy sessions.
The "Honey Do List?" Yes, I still have it.
No, I'm fairly certain it wasn't Scaramucci.
Honey, where did you say you left the shopping list?
Do you know when he'll be in? Just trying to shoot him back.
I'm calling for a friend. Have you filled that advertised position at the carnival yet?
Honey, I can't find the divorce papers
James, have you given me a copy of our strategic report that you sent to the boss?
I'm telling you: I mailed the check three weeks ago.
The way that I feel about this tax bill is more like a deep, stabbing betrayal.
I'm having second thoughts about using old communications technology.
I'm sorry, dear, but I still can't find your divorce petition.
Dr.! For the past week Ive had this sharp pain between my shoulder blades.
Sweetheart, I don't think suicide is supposed to work this way.
Yes, pointed, cutting and edgy, but not in the way you'd expect it to be.
I’d like to report a suicide by suicide note
Hello? I'd like to place an order for delivery.
So ya think she might want a divorce?
So, I told that Luther fellow what he could do with his theses.
She says she has 95 reasons to divorce me.
So, we finalized our divorce today.
Mom, even with something as trivial as a grocery list the jury is still out for my wife being too passive aggressive.
"No, I didn't read it. But I still want a refund. The knife's just not as sharp as advertised".
Then he said, "Hey man, whaddaya expect? I'm Jim Bowie. I don't do push pins."
Martin Luther's lawyer provided his demands.
Tomato, toe-mah-to... let's call the whole thing off.
Yes I received your offer, but I'm struggling with the fine print.
I know you said I wouldn’t forget this message, where is it?
Where's my To-Do List? I told you NEVER to move my To-Do List!
It is not true! I did not grope that girl!
Et tu, Bruce?
He said something about walking papers but no bonus...
I can't put my finger on it, but I have this feeling you're upset.
Yes- I'd like to report 95 of my undergraduate students...
What do you mean I can't get out of my wireless contract?
They keep trying to stick the chosen with the antiquated Constitution.
Am I middle-class? Yes, but I've not seen the tax reform bill.
The last time I saw it, you were reminding me we have dinner tonight at the Andersons.
I truly feel I am being stabbed in the back.
I have gotten used to robo-calls but robo-backstabbing is a bit much.
Hello, City First Baptist? I have a message from the Lutherans.
She wanted to be sure I knew what to order out for supper...
I fear my wife has declared a split with her own 95 Theses.
Hello, 911... Well I think I would like to report my car stollen.
Listen, I know you said you’d get back to me, but....
Don’t be ridiculous. Martin Luther’s been dead for years.
This list of reasons why you're filing for divorce feels like a knife in the back.
The news was on point today.
No, I can't tell you what the papers say. They're stuck where I can't read them.
backstabbing lawyers, amirite?
Police....someone just left me a terrible message.
Et to-do, Louise?
I'd like to reply to your complaints, but I can't make them out in the mirror.

She has a very aggressive divorce lawyer.
Hello George. You left your knife.
Honey, this calender is giving me a pain in the back
I fear my teflon-man days are numbered.
Honey, did you forget to pay the cable bill again?
SEE NOTE
No, really, what's black and white and red all over?
Is this 911? I’d like to report an assault by “honey-do” list.
Am I stuck with this contract; it's killing me.
All she left me was a letter.
My wife's declared 95 theses for our divorce.
Yes, I'm afraid I do remember kissing you on the playground at Alameda Elementary.
If I had known knives were involved, I would not have selected the cheapest delivery option!
I hope my lawyer hurries over to read this. The Novocaine from today's root canal hasn't worn off yet.
Certainly dear couldn’t you have found a better place to leave the “to do” list?
My wife is not happy that I failed to respond to your letter.
Are you sure you added a backstabbing clause in my pre-nup?
Yes Dear, I have a feeling that I received a note from your lawyer!
Yes boss, I know you've got my back on this project.
Luther's out
No,I really dont think that this is a new kind of Post-it.
Let's see.....I know I put that report somewhere.
YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS WERE JUST DELIVERED
It’s the take-home work that’s killing me.
Does your firm have any experience with pirate code?
All I said was you know what you can do with your lawyers's divorce agreement.
So, to be clear, you recommend I get internet service.
I'm hoping my Caption entry with 'sticking point' and 'stab in the back' will also make the 'Block that Metaphor' in the New Yorker.
The divorce took me by surprise too.
I can't find where you left the 'to do' list, honey, but I'm thinking I may need to get in for an adjustment today anyway.
It’s getting harder and harder to ignore her honey-do lists.
Please advise her that our divorce decree should have been posted publicly.
Honey... I would do anything to get You(r) back.
No mother, I didn’t have ‘Post no Bills’ written on my back.
Susan, this one night stand just stabbed me in the back.
I feel i have something important to tell the world !
'Just received our final eviction notice'.
.I'm being trolled old school.
I'm sorry, I don't text.
Sorry, I meant to post it on your smart phone.
Your mother says I never get the point.
911 I think my wife ran out of postage stamps!
Usually you're a pain elsewhere.
These new fees that you added to my bill are really killing me.
So I take it you served me the divorce papers today.
If you don't like the demands, feel free to take it up with my wife.
Yes, I was served with the divorce papers a few minutes ago.
No Mom, the job is great. Who told you that the paperwork could be a killer?
She called it a feminist manifesto but I call it a pain in the backside.
I feel betrayed, but also protested against.
Yes, I got your note.
Yes, hello police. I would like to report my wife. She stabbed in the back, again!
I can`t find your to do list, but I do have a sharp pain in my back
I better get off the phone. My wife asked me to check out our kids homework a few hours ago and I finally got the point.
Hi honey. Can you remind me where we put the mortgage application?
B-R-U-T-U-S, Officer. Or could have been Martin.
Yes I'm here, why are you calling?
My heart's still intact.
It's that new kids' birthday party game called "Pin the Gripe on the Parent."
That E-Mail you sent me Bill; how many people did you "cc"?
I have a pointed response to your question.
I can't describe what it felt like when I learned of your deceit.
I figured they’d cancel my shows but I didn’t expect so many exposés.
The boss says it's important, but I can't read it without a hand mirror.
Correct. Agatha Christie penned a short story on my back.
I want to complain about a back up on my posts. What's the matter? Fax machine broken?
There seems to be an issue.
"My lawyer objects to some of your demands"!
Satan's lawyers served me with notice of intention to repossess.
I have a contract killer on my back.
You're first on my wife's to do list, and, yes, I hate retirement.
Verizon? I'm pretty sure my wife wants to cancel our landline contract.
I noticed there is a clause that says I can pay you back in-kind.
Hello, Stan? As it turns out, I'm glad I put you on retainer. My wife literally just stabbed me in the back with an ultimatum.
I will give the service a "1".
...Yeah, only when I laugh.
Yes, I got your note dear - my dinner's in the oven.
You say you got my back, but how can I be sure?
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.... I am NOT an amendment!
She found your love notes, Trixie, and now they're my scarlet letters.
Yes, I was just notified that my health insurance premium is increasing again...
I don't mind waiting for the ambulance. My condition continues to be Stable

Hello, Marketplace, I want to enroll in Trumpcare...yes, I'll hold.
I hadn’t noticed before, but let me have a stab at it.
Where did you say you put the contract?
Can you connect me with the ghost of Martin Luther?
What I said was: "Post *no* bills.
The extra charges are killing me.
At least it doesn't say 'kick me.'
I always thought Martin Luther was my friend. How could he do this to me?
She said 'In five hundred years, we'll be famous.'
Yes I'm mentally checking out - I've posted a notice to that effect and where you can reach me if you need to locate me....
No, I can’t tell where you hid the divorce papers.
yes my wife did leave a goodbye letter with details of what she wants from a divorce settlement
My wife delivered her new demands for the divorce today.
'Yes, the first day went fine. They seem a friendly bunch.'

I have a question about the new Post-It Notes.
"Hello, Attorney Harris? I have a strong feeling I've been served with those divorce papers.

They say it's the middle-aged version of getting inked...yeah it's painful, but it's my last chance to be cool
I mean, I know the news cycle has gotten vicious, but this is ridiculous.
I have a feeling that my wife and I just don't see eye-to-eye on this.
Luther nailed his 95 theses, and Hazel has nailed me.
D/ Andro/ds Dr/m /lectric S/eep?
Can I report attempted murder by my accountant?
I got your message, thanks for watching my back

...Yeah....No....No, the doctor couldn't find anything...
should have used my cell phone
Frank, you're my attorney, but I think we've ironed out the terms of the divorce settlement ourselves.
You were supposed to pin your manifesto on the door, not my back.
My back is killing me and and I need doctor Thompson's number.  why are you not answering my calls???
Hello 9-1-1. I've been stabbed in the back.By who? My wife.I know, because it includes the honey-do-list I haven't done.
Her argument certainly came to a point.
Apparently Breitbart rejected my editorial submission criticizing Roy Moore.
Can I sleep on it?
Honey, I can't find the carving knife.
No, there was no really biting criticism.
I took your advice: Soon as I suspected he was approaching to serve me a subpoena I walked purposefully away.
When I said my wife reads my email, you drew the wrong conclusion.
You must have the wrong number. I never ordered any documents from you.
Hello, 911? my name is Wittenberg. I've just been stabbed by a guy who said he's Martin Luther.

911 I'd like to report an eviction
Just calling to say I don't appreciate how your people deliver demand payment letters.
I wish I could help, but I'm a little busy now.
When I turned my back on him, he served the summons in a vicious way.
Frankly Diana, I should have expected you'd have the divorce papers served this way... Hi Jim, I told you it was going to get bloody. She just served the divorce papers.
I prefer counsel to remove the knife to preserve the privilege of the content of the letter she claims to have discovered.

Hello FTC? I'd like to report a bill collector who may be a little too aggressive.

The article made a good point.
Mr. Luther’s out right now, would you care to leave a Thesis?
Yes mother, I know you warned me that divorce would be very painful.
No honey, I can't read it.
I have a nagging sense that the committee already stabbed me in the back with the notes I shared.
I'm aware I have no spine. I'm still standing aren't I?

These hidden fees are killing me
Yes, I received my credit card statement.
Let me see if I've got that right...Colonel Mustard, with the knife, in the study?
Here I stand, I can do no other.
I understand your desire for a divorce, but I think your summons service was a bit more vigorous than it needed to be.
He said something about 95 theses, and then, “Oops”!
I know the exterminator said he'd set traps next week, but is there any chance he could come by today?
Your message just came in.
Sorry, I don’t think I can make it tonight. My wife just gave me a killer to do list !

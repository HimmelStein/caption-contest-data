Maybe we should try thinking inside the box.
Look, it's right here - "cheese sold separately"
This is the last time I sign up for a research experiment sponsored by Ikea.
You're right; it's a trap.
Let's just go with the open floor plan.
They’re not testing our intelligence. They’re testing our marriage.
I think we can build a better one.
If we move the cheese tray to the front, we'll save a lot of  running around later.
Now that we ate the cheese I kinda don't see the point.
Remind me again how this will prevent us from getting Alzheimer’s.
Who writes these instructions...cats?
Apparently he expects us to do his entire science project for a piece of cheese.
Well this is just great honey.  The directions are written in gerbil.
Let’s try thinking inside the box.
We're in the control group.  The experimental group doesn't get the instructions
Let's just go to live in the box it came in.
To heck with this. Let’s go poop in their sock drawer again.
I dunno. This feels like a trap.
Those Swedish mice think they are so clever
Its mostly hallways and dead ends, but its affordable.
"Let's get Mexico to build it.
At last, a maze of our own.
Well wouldn’t you know it?
“Cheese not included.”
This confirms we're females - we're reading the instructions
These are the best laid plans I’ve ever seen!
Told you. Cheese not included.
I'm lost already.
Once we finish this, then we’ll teach him to give us food when we press the lever.
Why are we always doing this on Christmas Eve?
Maybe this IS the test.
This would be so much easier with a drill, glue, and prefrontal cortex.
We go full Escher on this and blow some minds.
Let's stop now while we still love each other.
They said if we build it, the cheese will come.
What we need are some carpenter ants.
I miss our hole in the wall...
No, I can't read the instructions. They're in Swedish. Also, I am a mouse.
Forget the instructions. Let's build a maze we can get out of.
The last time you made one of these without reading the instructions, it took us a week to get out!
'Why are WE building a better mousetrap?"
I take it they didn’t get the grant.
I remember the days when all you had to do was ring a bell."
I'm building a wall, a beautiful wall, and trust me, the gato is going to pay for it.
I'm thinking a center aisle with cheese rooms on either 
side.
Okay. Now all we need is opposable thumbs.
What the hell is an Allen wrench?
Based on prior experiments, if we put a piece of cheese in the far corner, the humans will put the maze together for us.
I bet the monkeys with the typewriters are having more fun.
After all this, it’d better be Brie.
Of course we memorize it, but if you go straight to the cheese they'll dissect your brain.
All the parts are here – we must be in the control group.
Who's Allen?
These grad students get lazier every year.
IKEA is a Swedish word  meaning "a part is missing".
First we build it, then we flip it.
Why are "we" trying to build a better mousetrap?
Wait, you already ate the cheese?
So... can you read?
I thought this was supposed to be confusing after it was built.
The maze is an intelligence test. Building the maze is a relationship test.
Don’t worry. They’ll never be able to put it together. It’s from Ikea.
An emergency exit---why, that's a great idea!
And then they act surprised when we go directly to the cheese.
OK, here's the plan:  we hide a couple of the screws, and while he's on hold with customer service, we make a run for it with the cheese....
It comes standard with Swiss, but you can upgrade to cheddar.
Wait...what if THIS is the test?
Okay, the first red flag is that there's no exit."
I am thinking outside the box!
These budget cuts at the lab are getting ridiculous.
Always act like you can’t find your way, or the humans won’t add more cheese.
This is bullshit. Lenny and Gary are in the next room getting high.
I'm not saying I won't help you, I'm just saying there are easier ways to get some cheese.
Maybe thinking outside the box will help
Did you keep the receipt?
This is the last time we buy anything at IKEA.
Who the hell is Allen Key?
Give a mouse a maze, and it eats cheese for a day. Teach a mouse to build a maze, and it eats cheese for lifetime.
Trust me.  2 words: Feng shui.
We’ll look busy during the day, and hide the dirt from the tunnel underneath at night.
The instructions look like they were written by a squirrel.
It says it's a two man job, but are we men or mice?
I'm thinking we could list the spare room on Airbnb.
Where are we going to get a phillips screwdriver?
Fortunately, this is a Monday puzzle. Those are the easiest.
I just hope we got the actual drug this time and not the placebo.
Get this, the dogs listen to a bell and eat. That's it.
If we ignore the directions and keep the open-floor plan, we'll find the cheese much faster.
I liked the one at the lab so much I thought, why not have one at home?
Let's see if there's a YouTube video.
do you want that Phd or do you want to be a lab rat your whole life?
Are you sure that if we build it, the cheese will come?
It looked so easy at Ikea
What d'ya say we forget the maze and eat the directions?
Remember, the longer we act lost, the more cheese we get.
I told you, it says it right here - Cheese not included.
I think the white coats will be more impressed if we don’t follow the directions.
If these instructions are how humans build mousetraps, we're definitely safe.
I didn't expect the cuts in federal funding to get this bad.
Maybe we shouldn't have solved that last maze so quickly.
I bet we could train a graduate student to build it for us
Why would we want to build a better mousetrap?
Spanish, French, Russian, English, Farsi, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese... nope, no instructions in Rodent. Again.
I know it’s a trap, but this is our chance to build a BETTER one.
It was bad enough when they just made us solve the damned thing.
This is what we get for performing so well in  the last maze.
This doesn't have to be our "forever" maze
Don't feel bad - humans can't follow these instuctions, either.
Let’s just eat the cheese and call it a day.
I’m not going back to that store. It’s like a maze.
I know its cheap particle board but our lifespan is only 9-12 months
Build a better what?
You gotta think outside of the box
Wait... the picture had cheese.
Could be a trap.
The Swedish mice can do it.
Wait...we're out.  Just why're we doing this?
I ask only because your last "magic cheese machine" snapped Mildred's neck.
If you think this is difficult, you should see what they gave the hamster.
I don’t know if this is to test our intelligence, or if they really can’t figure it out themselves.
The most important thing is that it needs to look hard to them.
Running on a wheel isn't enough, now they want us to build our own cubicles.
Cheese sold separately.
Forget the instructions. We build a straight path to the cheese.
Screw it, let's just eat the instructions.
Do you see the irony here?
It's a mousepad from Ikea!  What did you expect?
On second thought, open plan would be nice.
I think they're testing us.
But really, don't we all build our own prisons?
Whose idea was it to order from Ikea, anyway?
Since you are new to these intelligence tests, I’ll give you a tip: the more leftover screws you have at the end, the higher your IKEA.
You think this is a trap?
Buy from Ikea, you said.  We'll save money, you said.
I  told you, Råttfälla is Swedish for mousetrap!
This time wait till we finish before you poop on the instructions.
According to all the published studies we are supposed to be arguing right now
Why are the instructions always written in Hamster?
What do you think of an open concept this time?
If we're not careful, this could be a dead end job.
We Get This Right and It's, 'Hello, Silicon Valley!'
It was bound to come to this, what with all the cuts to the research budget.
Look I know I sound crazy, but the voice in my dream said, "if you build it, cheese will come."
Hey, it beats growing a human ear out of the back of your head.
goddamn Ikea!
There will be enough room for 15 babies every 4 weeks.
Let’s just cut to the cheese.
Looks like we are doing the IKEA divorce study again.
Oh great, "Cheese not included."
Let's mess with them and make it impossible.
Let's really mess with them and build it ourselves.
It's a joint research project between Johns Hopkins and IKEA.
No, the Lab guy doesn’t know that we have this.
Now remember, this is a relationship test, not an intelligence one—so just do what I say.
If we build it, the cheese will come.
Seriously....an offset hex wrench? We won’t even have opposable thumbs for at least 60 million years
'Maüsmaïze'? It's like they're not even trying anymore.
Just make sure to play dumb and go down a couple dead ends..
Well, let's give it a try.  I know these prefab homes aren't great, but it could beat the heck out of that hole-in-the-wall we're living in now!
Maybe we're overthinking this.
It's been tested on humans.
Nice job, Einstein, it says: 'cheese sold separately!'
It can't be that hard, we found our way out of the store.
I like it as is, with the open floor plan.
I told you to pay for assembly
Just once could we be in the control group?
Seems a little pointless since we already ate the cheese.
And then we can sublet the spare room to a Millennial.
Geometric shapes, clean lines. I'm thinking classic Bauhaus.
You're right, we should have paid for assembly.
No, I said I’m into Krafts.
Sure, it's gonna be a real pain to put together, but if it gets Junior into an Ivy League it'll be well worth it.
They make it look so easy in the lab!
It says a five-year-old child could do it.  Go find a five-year-old child.
Next they’ll want us to publish our findings.
These millennial scientists expect everything to be done for them!
Did YOU know we had to buy the cheese separately?
Are these the best-laid plans of mice and men?
They’re testing our spatial reasoning and you’re testing my patience.
I don't like these directions.  It could be a trap.
They just landed a huge grant to study irony.
I admit, I’m feeling less enthusiastic about this project now that I’ve eaten the cheese.
We may have a conflict of interest
If we do this right, they'll never find us.
I don't know Jerry, this seems like a conflict of interest.
These instructions make about as much sense as a New Yorker cartoon.
Now remember, just pretend like you don’t know how to get out,
then escape through this loose panel and we’ll meet by the air vents.
It was easier when we only had to solve the maze.
Since we're two blind mice, this has to be one of those fancy double-blind experiments.
Used to be we only had to run these stupid things.  Now we also have to assemble them?
I'm telling you, dude. These things are cheese magnets.
Either we're getting smarter or they're getting lazier.
Beats playing run from the python in the lab next door.
This year's grad students are the laziest ever.
Lets put the cheese right at the entrance this time.
I say chuck these directions, and go open concept.
Now that we've eaten the cheese, the rest seems kind of unnecessary.
The instructions make sense, but where do I get "thumbs"
I feel like we're being tested.
Remember the good old days when they only expected us to find the cheese.
What do you mean it says "Cheese Not Included"?
What would I.M. Pei do?
It's hard work and the food rewards are terrible, but it sure beats glowing in the dark or finding a human ear attached to your back.
Something about this feels like a trap.
If it’s done then why are there so many extra pieces
What would Escher do?
I don't understand the directions, either. Tell you what, let's have sex and in three weeks maybe the new kids can figure it out.
So as we begin to put this together, we need to observe the reaction of our test subjects over there in the white coats”..
I say we put the cheese at the start.
Say "a-maze-ing" one more time, fucker. I dare you.
Tell me again why we're building something that makes cheese harder to find?
Affordable mousing.
While they’re figuring out that we’ve given them an Allen wrench and Phillips head screws, we free the others and make off with the cheese.
We're prisoners of our own device.
Mexico's paying for it.
How can this be cat proof with no roof???
We're mice, not men! Follow the instructions.
Did you try the Swedish meatballs while you were there?
I hear they have the hamsters building wheels.
Too complicated. Might I suggest an open floor plan?
Remember, IKEA always leaves out one screw!
Well, I'm lost already.
Now I really think the guy in the lab coat is just screwing with us."
This could take a while.  Shall we order take-out from Hole Foods?
Wait, you can’t read either?
Let's just wing it, like they do upstairs in the White House.
It's not the destination-- it's the journey.
To heck with mazes. Let's build a cheese bar.
There's Camembert if you get through this level.
Is this floorplay? I only wanted one nightstand.
Just act like it's challenging and they'll keep feeding us.
It's the ultimate question: can we build a maze we can't solve?
Lets just add a back door and call it quits.
Let's just pay for the assembly service. It's only 15 chow pellets extra.
Let’s add a panic room”
No pressure, but the entire LSD-microdosing scientific community is depending on us to do this.
Any idea what “death or disfigurement” means?
Any one of your 700 brothers would love to be  spending this time with their Dad.
The instructions are in CAT.
I say it's finished, and I say the hell with it.
How the hell are we supposed to figure this out?  We're Norwegian rats, not Swedish.
Don't look at me, I don't speak Swedish either.
I think they're trying to test if we've developed the ability to swear.
We can make a killing selling maps to the rats.
The grant money ran out so we’re on our own.
Evidently they cut the budget for lab assistants.
Were you bred for emotional or cognitive intelligence?
Tell me again why the Swedes are so happy.
And then I heard a voice that said "If you build it...Brie will come".
It looks like a trap.
Let's  put the cheese at the beginning.
Who came up with these Mickey Mouse directions?!
I think we should just go with an open floor plan.
Aw, man.  'Cheese sold separately'
IKEA is Swedish for fuck you.
I say,forget it--let's just run around out here.
You know, we can just order the food pellets and avoid all this.
Wouldn't it be easier to just buy some cheese?
Make sure you act surprised once we're in there.
Ya know, without us the entire scientific infrastructure goes to hell.
You’ve got to think outside the box
What's eleven-sixteenths minus five-eighths?
You think Mickey has to put up with this crap?
Is it just me, or are these Harvard interns starting to get lazy?
Remember when we just had to run through these?
This feels like a setup.
I miss the old hole in the wall.
What a Mickey Mouse operation.
Remember when we used to just have to run through the maze?
Let's screw this up; the lab guy will put us on a higher dose, then we can figure out where he keeps the cheese.
So, is THIS the test or will we still be expected to run around this thing?
It's a trap, I tell you! A trap
The directions are in gerbil, rat, hamster, and guinea pig but not mouse
I'm guessing he couldn't get Mexico to pay for it?
Now's the time for us to think inside the box.
Let me read the instructions this time. Every time you do it,  the cheese ends up on the other side.
Damn. It says 'cheese sold separately'.
I have an idea. Let’s just eat the cheese now.
No, I don’t need you to call your dad.
If we do this right, all paths will lead to the cheese.
Next time, pay the extra fifty bucks.
You're right, it's missing a screw.  Let's just order Chinese.
This is the last time I sign up for a research study sponsored by Ikea.
This feels like a trap.
If you shout "I am Ah-Mazed" one more time this goes back to Ikea
We can buy a better maze when the kids are a little older.
Frankly, I'd rather get lost in a good book.
Let’s just opt for the open floor plan.
I hear the reward for completing this one is an illusory feeling of significance and self-worth.
I can’t figure this out. I must have gotten the placebo.
We’ll know it’s done when we can’t get out
We weren't supposed to eat the cheese first.
Some assembly required, my ass! I say we send the friggin thing back.
Seven slats, five boards, six screws, and one... Ralph - where's the piece of cheese?
Let’s just play in the box it came in
At Ikea,you told me you knew how this would go together.
Oops! We were supposed to save the piece of cheese for the very end.
This sort of takes the mystery out of it.
It's IKEA for mice.
I like the meatballs too but this is bullshit.
Maybe this time we should think inside the box.
But the Swedish mouse said this would be so easy.
You know we can just eat the cheese right?
What's the difference if the instructions are in Chinese.
We're mice, we can't read English either!
They’re doing s study on divorce rates.
I bet no one makes it past the Escher staircase.
I'm afraid there's no way out of this
It's all about the maze. You control the maze, you control the cheese. It's that simple.
While they argue about who lost a piece, you grab the cheese.
If we can’t assemble this we go into the group that gets electrodes attached to their testicles.
Let's go vertical.
I saw the same floor plan on an episode of This Old Mouse.
Seems like a lot of work for a piece of cheese.
With a bit of paint it will look like a Mondrian.
I'm lost. 
Run through it with me one more time.
Let's add a secret tunnel.
Well, rats.
Swedish mice must have opposable thumbs.
You've lost me.
Let’s not follow the directions and mess up their data.
What do you mean cheese not included?
An open concept would certainly give us more options for the piano.
Let’s put it together backwards and then watch the research analysts go crazy!
Last time I completed this I got a jolt of electricity and a female companion!
Yes, I'm sure.  Step 1 definitely said eat the cheese.
It takes four hours to build and when completed you can run the damn thing in less than a minute. Instead I suggest we spread droppings over the lumber and eat the instructions.
Here it is: “Cheese sold separately.”
Should we think outside the box?
We’ve graduated from the Psychology Department to the Architecture Department.
...I think we should just call TaskRabbit.
I thought it came with cheese.
It says it’s a MÅLMÄRKELSTØRP maze.
Lets do it with a Lego set and really blow their minds!
Build it and they will observe.
It's not psychology.  I just want to hear them say, 
"How the hell did they figure it out so fast?"
But it's SUPPOSED to be confusing!
I just think you've spent an awful lot for something you're only going to use once.
Who's Allen again?
Don't fuss over getting it perfect--I am pretty sure we are the control group.
There's just one tool we need:  opposable thumbs.
These instructions have been tested on humans.
Mexico will pay for it.
Let's just skip to step 27: place cheese in back left corner
I'm not paying 89 dollars for someone else to assemble it.
This is the cheapest lab I ever worked at.
Let's build it so they can't remember the path.
It's where we go to lose ourselves.
Damn. It says 'Cheese not included.'"
One day shipping really gave us no time to learn to read.
Isn’t there an app for this?
I'm not sure these are the best-laid plans.
The Mäz — many can run, few can assemble.
Rats
To heck with this. Let's just get free cheese samples from Costco.
Now you know why I suggested that we pay Ikea the $89 assembly fee.
This should be easy. They've been experimenting on humans for years.
Maze, schmaze, let's make a straight path to the cheese.
There is always one left over.
I preferred the days when we just had to walk through the maze
Let's not overthink it.
It just seems unethical for us to build a better mouse trap.
It occurs to me that this is the blueprint to our own undoing.
This is when I really miss Algernon.
Maybe we don’t follow the directions and make a straight line to the cheese?
We don't actually have to move the cheese.  It's a parable.
I'm already lost.
I know there always has to be a part missing but why did it have to be the cheese?
'Travel to Sweden for a research project,' you said...'
It will be fun,' you said...
It's from Ikea.  After this, the maze will be easy.
They left a screw out. How stupid do they think we are?
Cubicles or open office, it's still a rat race.
Just promise me the next time you have a project due, you won't wait until the last minute.
And we will have cheese in EVERY room!
Plans for mice by men.
It’s as if these instructions were written by an entirely different species.
I can’t read either.
Yes—the research project is funded by IKEA. How’d you know?
I know this is easy, but I think we should play dumb. They might give us drugs.
Let's build a Cheesecake Factory instead.
We should probably leave a piece of cheese here, so we can find our way back out'
My previous unpaid internship was even worse.
Something tells me we should stop right here.
Phase I of the study tests whether humans can follow IKEA assembly instructions.
What's the point? We ate the cheese.
I’m just saying that “Metaphör” is kind of an odd product name.
remember we had relatives at the building of Stonehenge,
we can do this!
First we see the cheese, THEN we work...
You have the permits right?
It's from some guy named Trump. It's all about building walls.
You're right. Thinking outside the box is much more satisfying.
After we finish this, let's build one for the cat.
We're part of a study on how long it takes before couples break-up while attempting to assemble IKEA furniture together.
I don't think this is a book shelf.
Seriously, we're mice; why would we want to put a maze together?
Hear me out - these missing pieces might actually be a GOOD thing...
Yes, I'm certain this is how Mickey got started.
Although these advanced I.Q. tests purport to conform to objective outcome-metrics, since we ate the cheese first I think we're done.
I guess I appreciate being brought in earlier in the process.
Memorize the map Phyllis.  If we get the cheese in under 3 seconds they'll put us in the gifted and talented  program
I say we eat the cheese now and forget the rest.
I've done the maze thing before.  Why don't we go for a hardwood floor instead?
According to IKEA, all you need is an Allen wrench and opposable thumbs.
What would Mickey do?
That stupid cat will never figure this out.
We are the architects of our misfortune.
I'm not kidding... its actual IKEA name is RATZNMÄZ.
Yeah, well I’m lactose intolerant, so frankly, this is already a no-win situation.
It doesn't have an exit, Charlotte, because we are recreating the experience of speaking with Spectrum's customer service.
How about I cook dinner and you put this together!
I fear that if we choose open concept, we’ll lose that traditional maze feel.”
Let's mess with them a build a pyramid!
Maze? I'm thinking a nice two-bedroom flat
They note that any 12 year old mouse can do this but, mice don't live that long.
I'm thinking an 'open concept' maze
Just why are WE building a better mousetrap?
At least they're not asking us to build a better mousetrap.
Great. You’re from the control group, aren’t you?
I vote we stick to an open concept.
What the heck does, 'When screwing shelves to align careful be to avoid misfortune of collapse,' mean?
Remind me. What's my motivation.
I'd rather do cancer research.
Minnie at IKEA said it would be simple
No, it says right here. Cheese sold separately.
Well, I don’t think we’re the control group.
Our bad luck, getting a Swedish laboratory.
Once we build it, we can rent it out to Psychologists
Okay, I’ll evolve a prefrontal cortex if you evolve manual dexterity.
This used to be zoned as ‘single family’, but now we can squeeze in 10 units at $750,000.00 a pop!
Or we could just build a Wall across the entrance to keep all the country mice out.
If anyone asks, Mexico is paying for it.
We just build a back door and we'll own this thing.
Why don't we try thinking inside the box?
Yeah, but we’re going to make THEM pay for it.
'You work it out. I was happy with a hole in the baseboard.'
I think we enrolled in the wrong research test.
Look!  In the fine print, "CHEESE SOLD SEPARATELY"
Only you would by a maze at IKEA
I feel like this is a set up.
Maybe there's a YouTube video we can watch."
I was thinking more open concept
Look, we’re men, we don’t need these instructions.
I don't think we were supposed to eat the cheese yet.
Not for nothing, but designing our own maze defeats the whole point of having a maze.
Did you know “bokhylla” just means “bookshelf”? It’s like they don’t even try.
The sooner we get this done the sooner we can get out of here.
Until someone tells me what the reward is, I'm not doing anything.
What’s the point? It says cheese not included.
I suppose we'll have to make our own cheese, too
...and I say we build a worse mouetrap!
You gotta be kidding me, it says the cheese is sold separately!
Now that you mention it, this does seem counterintuitive.”
We're never getting out of this, are we?
You're the one with the engineering degree.
After I retired, I found that I missed it.
What say we insert peg A into slot D instead, and make a straight run for the cheese.
Uncle Bill made one of these last year. Where is Uncle Bill?
Tell me again why we didn't just buy the cheese.
If we'd gone to Crate and Barrel like I suggested, we'd already have the cheese by now!
Remember the good old days when we just chewed through walls.
If we build it, they will feed us.
Well, I heard this has nothing to do with measuring our cognition, but actually budget cuts in the lab.
What's next, self-dissection?
Once we build it, the cheese will come.
How the hell are we going to do this without thumbs?
Or we could just buy some cheese.
These directions are in cat.
I think this requires thumbs.
Let's just chew the rectangles up and make a nest.
Why make things difficult?  Now I'm thinking open floor plan.
Let's think outside the box.
University funding is really down this year.
When you train them right, they put food at the end of the maze.
Cheese not included.
What are you looking at me for? You’re the one who got the Adderall injection.
Would you believe the one missing part is the cheese.
If he comes back, pretend you’re blind.
The instrucciones clearly state there should be ocho screws and we only have siete.
Let's put the cheese by the door.
My Swedish is rusty but I think Ikea means 'trap'
I haven’t the slightest IKEA.
Is it me or are these mazes getting more and more complicated?
I'm not sure which part is the experiment.
Look. If he wants us to build it ourselves, lets fill it with secret shortcuts and entryways.
Apparently, we're in the research department at IKEA.
Do you still think the NIH is adequately funded?
Face it, we're lost
I’ve replaced their regular coffee with decaf. Let’s see how long it takes them to get this back together.
We definitely have an ethical problem here!
If we were in a lab, this part would have been done for us.
We'll make a few wrong turns on purpose just so they don't get suspicious.
I prefer the FJÄLLA maze. Comes with a meatball.
A maze can't start and end at the same place. How dumb do they think we are?
Okay I'll come clean.  I ate the cheese.
A maze? What do you think we are, lab mice?
These IKEA mazes, again I have 2 extra screws and I have no idea where they belong
It says here we have to provide our own cheese or peanut butter.
It's learning to read the instructions that's the tricky part.
I already ate the cheese.
Wouldn't you know it, the cheese is missing.
No matter how many times I try I always have one piece left over.
Of all the places to buy mazes, you had to choose IKEA.
OK, we want to end up with the cheese by the front door
You believe this? Cheese not included.
Look on the bright side-they could have asked us to build a better mousetrap!
All this for a piece of cheese?
Let’s just scrap the whole project. I’m tired of the rat race.
A maze? No, these are awful, tiny work spaces, I call them "cubicles."
At least it's a prison of our own making.
Jerry, this is the last time we are going to Ikea.
They forgot to include the opposable thumbs.
Let's think outside the box and add a cheese and wine bar.
Screw it.  Let's just eat the plans.
Didn't I tell you if it looks like it's already been open, the cheese will be missing?
I told you the cheese wasn't included...
This says the cheese is not included
Cheese not included?! Did you even read the box?
Why assemble it? Works great right now!
How difficult could it be?" , you said
Budget cuts in research, I guess.
I CAN read.  It doesn't help!
It's an exercise in existentialism, Ted. We build our own prisons.
This calls for some outside-the-box thinking.
I think we'll be happiest with an open floor plan.
We'll call it Rat-a-Lago. It's gonna be great.
Call 1-800-LAB-RATS. I don’t have time for this.
Used to be, we just had to find the cheese.
I don’t want to build a better mouse trap either Larry, but it’s part of our community service.”
‘"I know it was free, but I can’t help feeling it’s some sort of a trap."
What are your thoughts on open floor plans?
It's in Chinese, and 2 screws are missing.
What if building it IS the experiment?
Wait, is this a trap?
Do you remember how we screwed up the chest of drawers?
Wait, what if we went with more like an open floor plan, with the cheese in the middle?
I can't shake the feeling that we are being watched.
Your mother wants us to explore all inside paths for getting you into a good college lab.
No, do you have any opposable thumbs?
Step 1 was not eat the cheese
Some assembly required. Cheese not included.
Since we can't read, this is perfect.
It's like these things are designed to be confusing.
The instructions are in Swedish. Tell them again we’re Norwegian rats!
It says'Cheese sold separately.' Are you kidding me?
Whaddya mean, screw the partitions?
I was hoping for a more open concept maze.
Lately I've been wondering if the cheese is even worth it.
I’m not comfortable with this. It feels like cheating.
What do you mean, "cheese sold separately"?
It is an IKEA store. After we build it we have to find our way out.
Again I ask you, why are WE building this?
...and I thought getting through a maze was difficult.
Cinderella has been really depending on us for everything lately.
The white mice have it preassembled.
Fortunately, if we get it wrong, we can just gnaw through the side.
'Cheese not included.' *sigh* Rats.
Let's just make bunk beds and call it a night.
I'm actually lactose intolerant. I just like carpentry.
Its like those gangster movies, where the hitman makes the dirty rat dig his own grave.
I’m telling you, this is our last purchase from IKEA.
I've got an idea.  Let's forget the walls and use an open floor plan!
The sooner we get this thing built the sooner we can get try to escape!
I always suspected we were the architects of our own despair ...
This is nothing, you should see the Swedish Fish Tank.
It says BYOM! What does that mean?
No, let's not call TaskRabbit.  They sometimes send cats.
I'm building us a real home out of this Ikea drawer organizer. No more hole in the wall.
You ever feel like we're being watched?
If the humans can’t assemble it why should we help
Doesn't the psychologist know we're Rattus norvegicus not Rattus swedegicus?
Well, I think “No Exit” was the best thing he wrote.
Let's have some fun. Instead of a maze, I say we build a man cave.
We're missing a part.
What happens in the labyrinth stays in the labyrinth.
It says "no collusion and no obstruction.
Forget it. Let's just eat the cheese.
Trust me, kid. There are worse place to work than the IKEA lab.
I'm thinking that this entire exercise is part of a cynical conspiracy to have us construct obstacles to our own happiness.
They're testing our marriage now
They're testing our relationship.
First, they made us press levers for food. Now, we have to build our own mazes!
I know it’s IKEA.  I wasn’t planning to leave it to my children.
I’m gonna need some cheese to get me through this.
It’s in Swedish.
It’s my own fault for criticizing the old maze.
I bet Schrödinger's cat never had to deal with this type of treatment”
Trust me, the tiny house movement is gonna be huge!
You had to go Mid-Century Modern
Where do you want the nursery?
It was your idea to go to Ikea.
So based on these blueprints, we should be able to build our maze in a week...just in time for Timmy's science fair.
Relax, I've watched the humans. How's your vulgar slang?
Self-assembly mouse trap? Way to go, Mike.
I think this is a test.
You know they only use us to prove a human should be able to assemble it.
We've solved it on paper. Let's quit while we're ahead.
At least - when the time comes - we'll know our way around!
The cat in the YouTube video said to leave the roof off.
Trump said to build WHAT?
The research grant ran out.
You sure these are kitchen cabinets?
I don't know -- might be a trap.
Do you ever get the feeling you are working for the opposition?
You were right. We should have bought the bookshelves.
According to Ikea, it will only take half our lifetimes to assemble.
Hear me out. What if we just call this done.
Don't you see Sal?  If we build, they'll make us run through it.  If we don't build it, they'll force us to ingest mezcal and mushrooms.  It's a no-brainer.
You've got to be kidding me. Cheese sold separately?
Wait, where's the cheese?
Getting to the cheese would be much easier if we 
kept it as an open concept.
Feng Shui? I’m still trying to learn Swedish!
And at the end we get Swedish meatballs
Don't build the maze, and run straight for the cheese? Don't you see...that's exactly what they want us to do.
Forget the maze, lets do cubicles
Son, if you want to become a Harvard lab rat, you must learn the basic maze.
Why should we be the ones to build a better mousetrap?
No!  It's not a good idea to subcontract this to a cat.
So we’re agreed: hidden panel to the cheese room.
I feel like building it ourselves kind of defeats the purpose.
Couldn’t we have just paid the extra $20 to get it pre-assembled?
Even if it wasn't in Swedish, I STILL wouldn't be able to build this!
Are you sure this is how we trick the humans into feeding us all the time?
So this is what decreased funding for science looks like...
Let's say partition instead of wall.
I was going to say 'this is amazing' but I know how much you loathe puns.
I can't figure this out. We must be in the placebo group
I would prefer a more open-concept maze.
It's called an open office and we each get something called a cubicle.
...or we can just use the panels to put on a roof and have a great studio apartment.
Let's let the lab tech put it together. He thinks he is so smart.
Talk about cost cutting in the lab.
Every time something is missing. But the cheese? Really?
Yes, Rob, I know you lived in Rio de Janeiro while you were in the Peace Corps -- but that was years ago, let's just use the English instructions.
This is above my pay grade.
I felt like a guinea pig too when I was your age, but building your first house is the first step in joining the rat race."
Did you remember to buy the "no opposable thumbs required for assembly" model?
Apparently they hired some new researchers from Sweden.
Do you ever wonder if this is all just a big experiment?
Uh oh, I smell a rat!
Instructions!?! You don't see Cats reading instructions, do you?
Or we could just renew our gym memberships.
I’m not going any further without a reward.
No, I didn’t....
I thought YOU got the building permit!
We have a chance to change the paradigms here.
boards (12), screws (6), Allen wrench (1) 
"I think China's mad about the tariffs."
"Why?"
"Step One: You figure it out."
…  then we time how long it takes them to start putting cheese in it.
Let's make sure it's not all left turns this time.
I warned you: Once you find the cheese, the test gets harder!
Don't you see? That's what they want you to  do!!
Remind me again why we're building a better mousetrap?
I should never have asked for a promotion at work.
If we build it, they will come...with cheese
When someone builds a better mousetrap, it won't be Ikea
On second thought, let's do open concept.
Hmm...how about an open floor plan?
What do you say we call my cousin in Stockholm?
Trojan what?
Yes, I know I was only supposed to get Swedish meatballs.
Looks good to me - I think we're done here.
Every language but Mouse!
We have sixty-seven children, Arlene.  Surely someone speaks Swedish.
Didn't we order a house?"
(Eve Lily Lessard, Age 7
See? This is what happens when the government cuts research funding.
...Ask for help?! Are we men or mice??
It’s for ages two months and up.
This year’s funding cuts sure have hit the lab hard.
It doesn't matter which language these are written in; we're mice.
Something's not right this time... there's no way out.
I think the cheese will look nice in the foyer.
I hear you, but try explaining irony to the Swedish.
Let's go with the open floor plan.
You know, an open floor plan might make our lives a little easier.
Maybe we should go back to chewing through the wall...
It's a little extra work, but it's worth it for the Swedish meatballs.
The guy in the white coat says we now have to differentiate our skill set from the global workforce.
Says here, "Cheese sold separately."
Remember, they mustn't know that we are a couple of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings.
Dude you’re in the LSD group, shut up and give caffeine the instructions.
Sure, it’s a bit more work, but when you get to the end there are Swedish meatballs.
‘Remember the objective of this experiment is to throw that Professor off his tenure tract.’
It’s an enigma wrapped inside a riddle.
Remember, left, left, right, left, right, right, cheese!
Well, the first thing we have to do is learn how to read.
Because we saved THREE dollars with self-assembly!
This is kind of like asking a condemned man to build his own guillotine.
I think we can safely say we've made it to the next level of lab rats.
Let's take our time. It's not a race.
Yes, I believe we CAN build a better mouse trap!
This is the floomjin. The flamjen is the one that has the cheese.
Do you think the cheese will also be from Norway?
Important life lesson: the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
Don't tell me you ate the cheese already
Of course it's bad science! Welcome to the intersection of privatization and funding cuts to basic research.
Let’s put the cheese in the front this time!
Then, if we make it through, it leads to the Ikea exit door.
Whaddaya mean "cheese not included"?
With the money we saved we can buy a nice piece of Asiago.
It's not the electrical shocks or the seemingly random food treats that motivate me as I work on this maze kit. It's your encouragement and simple belief in me.
For cheese? That’s it?
I can build a better one.
Living in the sink cabinet at the Jameson's was a much simpler time.
It was much easier to disassemble, wasn’t it?
Screw this.
I'm starting to see the advantages to your 'open space' idea.
It can't be that tough. We've trained humans to do it.
I’m telling you, if we build it, the cheese will come.
There's no exit!  It's not a maze, it's a mousetrap!
Lets screw them up and build it outside the box!
I hear the hamster needed outside help to put his wheel together.
Impossible! These instructions are just a maze.
We'll earn more cheese in construction than in research.
You had it upside down all along, Stuart! The cheese goes at the end.
I'd like to put the cheese at the entrance!
My cousin built one of these and we ever saw him again.
This psychologist is nuts.
My postdoc interned at IKEA
A permit?! How much does a ferkockte permit cost?
Rats! It says the cheese is sold separately.
Are we going to build a straight path to the end or are we going to make it fun?
If those humans think two mice are going to lift a bunch of plywood, they're dumber than I thought.
I say forget the maze, let’s go straight for the cheese!
Let’s ask Mexico to pay for it.
These instructions are so simple they must have been written for humans.
Well what do you know, all the parts are here.
I said I could do it I’m not calling my dad
If our relationship can survive putting together this thing, it can survive anything.
I thought we agreed on the open floor plan.
Let’s build a food cart and blow their minds.
I just don't think we got the one with solar panels
Ugh, instructions say Not Animal Tested
If we can put this thing together, we sure as hell can find our way out of it !!
Let's build it so that it looks challenging - he'll like that!
Lucky the guys aren't here--let's read the directions.
Hard to tell which is the real test.
They’re testing a theory on the complexity of assembling IKEA furniture.
What’s the Allen wrench for?
The bait? A beer and a pizza should do it.
Why?
Trust me, we build this thing right it'll be a cheese machine.
But now we’ll know the solution.
should i get someone from taskrabbit?
This is the absolute last time we buy our maze from IKEA
Remind me; Why are we building this?
Remind me why we're doing this again?
You complain every time we go to Ikea.
How bad do you want the cheese?
I'm sorry you have to do all the work Allen, But this thing didn't come with a "Dennis wrench".
We have got to think out of the box.
What the #$@* is a dowel?
Look, I'm never going to finish this without a little positive reinforcement.
In my defense, it came with a Swedish meatball voucher.
If we do the work ourselves, we can flip this maze for a lot more cheese.
Actually, I think an open flow concept would give it a more contemporary look.
And I thought getting THROUGH a maze was hard.
I think it makes sense to start by opening the little packet  of cheese.
Tell me again why we are building a better mousetrap.
This is exactly like the one they featured on ‘This Old Maze’.
That's the last time I shop at IKEA
Are you sure Frank Lloyd Wright got started this way?
This one is designed to test our patience.
That's it. We are never buying anything from IKEA again.
Let's just stick with the open concept.
Do we really want to build more walls between us?
For $50 Ikea will assemble it," I said. But Noooooooo
If we design and build our own maze just think how we can mess with the researcher's heads.
Their cheese is better than their instructions.
Skinner never used Ikea.
After we build the labyrinth, I'll put on a pair of horns and really freak them out!
Who better than us to build a better mousetrap?
I'm sure it'll come together--these are the best-laid plans I've ever seen.
Looks like the researchers got that IKEA grant.
We’d get a lot more work done with an open floor plan.
I really like the open floor vibe it has right now.
They let the research assistants go because of funding cuts. Finding the cure is up to us now.
Ever get the eerie feeling that you're a metaphor?
If his grant doesn’t get funded soon, we’ll be hiding the cheese too.
Ikea never told us that we'd need an opposable thumb
The instructions are in Mandarin.
With a beer in the middle, we’ll get a human every time.
I've been saying since the Middle Ages, literacy is overrated in species without opposable thumbs.
I can't wait to see the look on their faces tomorrow morning
Next, they’ll expect us to make our own cheese.
Nah, dude, this is the test. The maze is inconsequential.
Did you remember the bread crumbs?
Believe me. If you build it, the cheese will come.
What the...? It says here 'cheese not included'.
Marie Kondo called. She wants her drawer dividers back.
I think they just want to see if we can figure it out.
This got a 4.9 star rating.  It's called the Bitoor Moȕzn Tryapp.  Not sure what that means, but my sister built one and loved it so much she never came out.
First, we'll have to learn to read.
Let’s make it look challenging
Don’t worry, there’s always GPS.
Don’t look at me, I wanted to get a used one off Craigslist.
Assembly is extra but on the bright side it came with Swedish meatballs and a jar of lingonberry jam.
Screw it. Wanna grab a pizza?
I don't like the Feng Shui of these maze blueprints.
We're only rewarded if we run through a maze, not assemble one.
Look busy.  This is the first test.
Phase two trials are always more rigorous
This is the Swedish version of Who Moved My Cheese?
What if we just go for open concept?
Trust me, Fred. “Exploding Litter Box” is going to go viral!
I hope they put Swedish meatballs at the end instead of cheese this time.
I can’t read Swedish, but I swear there are pieces missing.
Beats me. I only know how to find the cheese.
Well, I think buying the prefab model would have gotten a higher intelligence score
They don't know we saw the plans, so when you break the record, act really surprised.
OK, we agree, then. We'll lay it out open-concept style and we each get our own master bedroom with a walk-in closet.
How do you think we'll get the human to run through it?
Ironically, this is our ticket out of here.
It absolutely did not take the entire weekend when I made the exercise wheel.
Stop saying "Who moved our cheese?"  There IS no cheese.
This time, let’s make it a little easier to find the pantry.
Open concept is the latest rage. I want to be able to see the babies from the kitchen.
I thought we agreed on open concept.
Tim, are you sure the cheese didn't come in the box?
Mon dieu! Alain, not Allen!
I'm creating my own reality.
Because the last time we made the maze out of corn, your family ate the whole thing.
Tell me again why we want to build a better mousetrap?
You know, we could have some fun with this.
We bit off more than we can chew.
It  says 'some assembly required'. -Obviously a trap.
No. What's Flowers for Algernon?
I told you we shouldn't order from Ikea.
Fuck...this...shit.
Trust me, the more missing parts, the better.
Tell me you didn't get the placebo.
You say it's Stockholm syndrome. I say it's IKEA!
I think we should go with an open floor plan.
It would be ironic if this turned out to be a rat trap.
Let's build the world's worst mousetrap.
It says here we can call for help.
Do you ever wonder if we sometimes get talked into doing things that are not in our best interest?"
I still say we should go with the open floor plan and a few throw pillows.
It's called a Stockholm Maze and we WILL enjoy assembling it!
Let's start with the cheese and work backward.
I'll build it but I'm damned if they can make me run around in it.
This is what I hate about Swedish labs.
Oh, great.  The instructions are written in Cat!
Now that I'm designing the mazes, you'll always find the cheese in the first room past that door.
If we make it too easy, they might catch on and stop the cheese.
This is about creating our own reality
Well I know we use this to line the bottom
I'm not going back there for a missing screw.
IKEA owes us three screws and a piece of cheese
Piece of cheese.
...and with your small investment, I can add a second floor and flip this in weeks not months.
Honestly, I think it works better as a studio.
Look what we can do with this new drug we're testing."
Now, remember, this is a Skinner box. Our behavior counts more than our thoughts.
I heard that IKEA's funding the research.
I checked the box 3 times, and I swear to you there is no Allen wrench in there!!
My granddad tells of a time when these came pre-assembled, with a prize inside.
The spring's missing!
I warned you about these millennial graduate students.
Let’s just YouTube the tutorial.
They test on mice first to make sure it’s not harmful for new couples
Just act dumb the first few times...then it's cheese heaven.
Only the Swedes could convince *us* to build a better mousetrap.
Let's go ask the cat.
I was Ok  booking my own travel and pumping my own gas 
but this time they’ve gone too far.
I say we take the cheese and get the hell out of here.
A second bathroom will minimize droppings.
I think I know how to read instructions Minnie!
Wouldn't it make more sense to have the cheese on outside tables and serve wine?
where do you want the droppings
We have to build it now, too?
On second thought I think we should go with an open room concept.
Should we build this consistent with Skinnerian or gestalt principles?
I heard the winning team gets Swedish meatballs.
We can build the maze in thirty minutes, find out way out in 4, or we can climb up the mans leg and grab the cheese when he freaks out.
How will we know if we get it right?
I liked the meatballs.
Following the assembly instructions backwards was brilliant!
We're clearly not working for a rocket scientist.
This would be a lot easier if we could read.
Why'd you have to go to Ikea?
Those NIH budget cuts are really trickling down!
Do we really need a better mousetrap?
It's a TRAP!!!
Geez, we solve one maze and he sure steps up the degree of difficulty.
What?! The cheese is sold separately?!!
Of course there are no words. Mice can't read!
Maze? No. It's my new bed frame and nightstands.
It says right here, ‘cheese not included.’
Screw this - let's think outside the box.
Stop complaining.  A maze is suppose to be complicated.
I'm hungry. Let's eschew the instructions.
No! I like it, it’s just— I think they’re going to notice.”
It's IKEA, what could go wrong?
If homo sapiens designed it, it cannot be that complicated
Looks like we’re in the control group on this one.
This is the last time I buy something from IKEA.
This is only page 1. There are 12 more to go.
I prefer a more open floor plan.
No! I do not read Swedish"
I told you buying prefabricated is a scam.
DIY. WTF!
With ten cubicles, we should be able to make a few bucks.
Oh no, it's a better one.
As usual, we’re short two screws.
Can you believe it is in Swedish?
Gee, I dunno. Do we really want to be a metaphor?
Let's make it tough so they'll think we're struggling.
Come on, if Arnold Palmer can design a golf course we can do this!
And all I’m sayin’ is freedom’s an illusion. We all live in prisons of our own making.
Wait a minute. Let’s think outside the box.
It goes without saying that we don't tell anyone we built this.  Okay?
Sorry I couldn't get us out of this.
If we don't put up the walls, it will be easier to get the cheese.
Who says we have to build a maze? I'm more an open floorplan kinda mouse.
So you insist on knowing your IQ. And I say, we can take a test on the internet. But NO! You insist on going to IKEA
Just call TaskRabbit. I think he’s in Lab 4.
Obviously IKEA has very few mice in its design department
We set it up, we run it, we time ourselves. Something to do with the funding cuts.
We just started and I'm already lost.
The real problem is going to be getting the cat to try it.
Let's just forget this and go straight for the cheese.
Wait—you have to buy the cheese SEPARATELY?
If we build it ourselves, we should do well on the tests.
An open-plan office might be WAY simpler.
Cheese sold separately." Damn
It's all in Swedish!
We got this- a straight line to the cheese.
Now they want US to train our replacements!
I told you we should've just rented
Remind me... why are we doing this?
The kit states “cheese included.” Is that cheese on your breath?
Yep, the three most feared words. Some assembly required.
Next they’ll want us to make our own cheese.
Quit saying, "Make it snappy."
I knew there were budget cuts, but this is ridiculous.
This looks hard. Maybe we should just go with the open floor plan.
We should let Customer Service know the set arrived without cheese.
I say let them build their own better mousetrap.
We won't have to go back on the treadmill if we pretend we don't know what we are doing!
I'm thinking fewer dead ends this time.
If we can put this together, we'll video THEIR confusion.
Even by  psychologist standards, this is nuts.
You know... we could do an open floor plan.
Well we took the whole thing apart, so where's the cheese?
I say we just go to the bar
He’s learned to place the cheese correctly nearly every time. If he solves this one, we should publish.
Oh, great. We survived the tobacco experiment, but now this says "This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer".
If we were really smart we’d have known what ‘some assembly required’ means.
Why don't we add a reward step at the end and see if any human will follow the directions
Let's just make sure shoppers go through every room.
Let's put the cheese right at the beginning.
Let's do the maze at IKEA, you said... It'll be FUN, you said...
I’m not going in there again until they start
offering some vegan options.
We have to think outside the box.
It's from IKEA.
So just how hungry are you?
I have no idea how this goes together--I'm a Norwegian rat, not a Swedish one.
Let's memorize plan. We'll complete the maze challenge while walking backwards. It'll skewer their research for years, and maybe they'll keep us around longer."
Who moved my cubicle?
I just realized we don't have thumbs.
I don't know.  I say we just take the cheese and run.
I couldn't help it:  I ate the cheese.
Sort of a conflict of interest, but a job’s a job, ya know?
It says it right here, "Cheese not included."
There's no clause specifically stating the cheese must be at the end.
This has disaster written all over it
Let's try and think outside the box.
No, no cheese. Swedish meatballs.
I hear what you are saying but I think dead ends are so last year.
This is the last time we get a maze from IKEA.
First let's agree where the cheese should go.
I can already tell this experiment isn't going to end well.
Great.  We haven’t even started and you’re already lost.
Typical! Cheese not included.
I know...what can I say?  It’s from IKEA
This is not what I meant when I said I want to live some place amazing.
This is why I said “no Scandinavian labs,” Karen.
Let’s just Google it.
If you say 'hugge' one more time, you can build it yourself.
Are we going to have to make another trip to the Home Depot?
I hate you so much right now.
Fortunately, I resisted my urge to eat the instructions.
Remember, we want to build it so we're by the exit when we finish.
I didn't expect these instructions to be so labyrinthine.
I actually understand the instructions...Amazing!
Turns out, building a maze is a heck of a lot harder than finding your way out.
I'm afraid I'm  not gonna be much help. The lab guys removed my hippocampi and I've forgotten every bit of Chinese I ever learned.
Let me get this straight. Scientists know we can build this complex maze — yet the whole reason for it is to have us run around inside to see how smart we are. Is this a government operation or what?
Are you kidding me?  They forgot to include the cheese?
The reward at the end of the maze is a Swedish meatball.
I'm thinking split level, wine celler in the basement.
What's this 'cheese not included' nonsense?
I was thinking more of an open floor plan.
Oh great.We've got all the parts, but the wrong tool.
First we kill all the lawyers.
It takes a mouse to build a better mousetrap.
Why can't we serve our cheese on a plate like everyone else?
What do you think "placera ost här" means?
As far as I am concerned, they are all extra parts.
We’ve got this!  You can read, right?
Of course the one in Jersey is bigger but for the last time, we're city mice.
No wonder they call it Nö Ejksøt
No, I can’t read Swedish either.
Cutbacks
Fine. See if YOU can do any better without thumbs.
The cat will never find us once we get this thing built.
I think this whole animal testing thing has gone a bit far.
I'm sure the website said cheese was included.
Now that we've taken it apart it should be easier to find the food.
This would be easier with opposable thumbs.
See, I told you. It says right here, “Cheese not included.”
This is a lot of work just for cheese.
IKEA?!
This is gonna be harder than the damn maze .
Don't run the maze too fast or he'll know we cheated.
Darn, the cheese is sold separately
I TOLD you we should have shopped at the dollhouse store!
How about we just build a better mousetrap instead?
The quality sucks - they forgot the exit!
I think they add extra parts just to mess with you!
A line-of-sight path to the exit? Amazing!
Wait, it's missing the cheese.
Just act baffled and they’ll give up on this stupid new experiment.
I'm not sure what this is, but it looks amazing.
It's IKEA, so we start on page 3, go to page 1, then to page 7.
Any chance you speak Swedish?
So, what are all these extra pieces for?
It was a Secret Santa gift from the lab!
It's the intelligence test before the intelligence test.
After we're done, let's put the cheese at the beginning this time.
It used to be enough to figure out how to escape a maze.
Yup, it's Ikea.  Looks like the research grant was trimmed again."
Why? Because it's here.
Get over yourself, Jerry. Nobody's watching to measure your response to this.
Why are we building a "better" mouse trap again?
I'm telling you, we need to start thinking outside the box!
Just saying, something strange about them hiring us to build a better mouse trap.
Whoa! Cheese not included.
Honestly, it would be easier to just build a better mousetrap.
Our lives are completely meaningless.
Geoff, to be brutally honest with you, I do think the culture of our  lab has changed somewhat since the move to the private sector.
I think it’s some kind of test.
Navigating the maze is really quite simple if you read the plans first.
When I told you to "amaze me" this wasn't what I had in mind.
Things are bad when you've to make your own maze.
That’s the trickle down effect of the science funding cuts.
Wait. WE have to build the maze our own cheese will be hidden in because Mexico refused to pay for it ?
Frankly, after looking at the parts list, I fail to see what's in it for either of us.
Please tell me you didn’t get this from Ikea.
Task rabbit assembles this in 20 minutes.
More importantly, did you pick up the Swedish meatballs?
How many times...it's the Deluxe kit that includes the Gruyere, Bob.
On the list of necessary tools it says "opposable thumbs."
These oft go awry.
Do you understand Swedish?
Apparently, this one's a marriage test.
I say we just make a run for it.
How advanced do they think we are?
It’s the best laid plan of mice only. Where are the men?
Their mistake. I ordered the one for humans.
Well, this will easier to build than that Skinner Box you just had to have.
If you say, “Fire code.” one more time, you can go, right back to renting.
We should have paid the extra for Ikea to assemble it.
Are we sure this is not a mousetrap?
It was a marketing trap, dear. It says here that the cheese for this maze is sold separately!
If I plan this right, the kids will be looking for the cheese until we can finish a conversation.
This maze ends with Swedish meatballs instead of cheese.
This is way too complex. Let's go for open concept.
Maze, schmaze...what I want is a room without a roof!
Let’s use TaskRabbit.
You think you’re lost now...
If we build it, food will come!
It's so easy a human can do it
Why don't we just make it open-concept and use the pieces to make a coffee table and cheese tray?
What do you mean the cheese is sold separately?
Do they think we're blind?  It's just another trap.
We can sell the maps for a huge profit.
Let's put it together so there's no way out, and then let them call us stupid.
IKEA, am I right?!
Honey, can we have separate bedrooms?
Algernon is late again.  I say we build without him.
Ugh, the instructions are in rat.
If we finish they give you Swedish meatballs.
Let's just order the cheese online.
Honestly, I only go there for the Swedish meatballs and the sparkling pear juice.
Never order from IKEA.
Talk about getting lost in your work.
See, nobody's out to get us. Parts C, H, E, E, S, and E are all here!
I didn't read the fine print: cheese not included.
The cuts for science research went a bit too far.
Is our relationship ready for this?
We'll never get the cheese - it's Ikea.
Feels like a trap to me
I wouldn't normally go the trouble, but they've got a nice hunk of Manchego today.
Look, just think outside of the box on this one.
Believe me. They forgot the hole.
This would be much easier if we had opposable thumbs.
You think this is hard? Try putting a pop-up tent back in its bag!
Of course, Ikea tells us how to put the damn thing together, but doesn't tell us how to get out when we are done.
Do you think we got the new drug or the placebo?
Just to make it interesting, let’s decrease the behavior after the positive reinforcement.
Just as I feared:  “Cheese not included.”
They say that the first step to fulfilment is to make your own path.
This a whole new level of animal cruelty
I can't make heads or tails of these directions.
Screw the instructions. Let’s make it easy and just put the cheese right inside the door.
'the mice will play'... My ass!
Reminds me of Christmas Eve.
Should we opt for the beginner, intermediate or advanced maze design?
Seems a lot of work for a piece of cheese.
Uh oh, it's written in Cat.
What was wrong with the old one?
Let's add a trap door and when no one is watching we can blow this joint.
It is really a marriage test.
What do you mean, “Why?”?
Wait. We're supposed to make it harder to get the cheese?
Maybe we should put some people inside and observe them.
The main thing is to keep them putting cheese at the other end.
The cheese isn't included?
Who of us isn't guilty of building his own trap that he then longs to escape from?
I told you we shouldn't have shown them how smart we actually were.
With the budget cutback, now we get to assemble our own maze!
It's not about the cheese.
What kind of Mickey Mouse outfit is this to have us build our own maze?
Instead, how about an open plan?
The map helps, but what are we looking for?
Don’t do it, it’s a trap.
All I ever wanted to know was who moved my cheese.
Forget it, let’s just go get meatballs.
And you're sure that, after we build this, there'll be cheese at the end?
Sure we can talk. Too bad we can't read.
Screw the directions! We're building a sturdy roof 
and a safe, loving home for the three of us."
"Oh darling, do you mean...?"
"Yes, my cousin needs a place to stay.
Sadistic human not included.
Let’s test this on humans first.
Now do you believe me when I say there have been some serious scientific cutbacks.
I feel like cats wrote these instructions.
This is one of the easiest mazes we've ever built!
It says cheese not included.
Donnen't vorryrryen, I pootten dissen togennderren.  Easy deesee. You jooststen getten der catten.
This is the last maze I buy from a cat.
Can you read Gerbil?
I thought you ordered maize.
So I was thinking of something really complicated.
What do they mean, 'Cheese sold separately'!?
We can build it with a foolproof backdoor.
I can run the maze, no problem.  I just can't build one.
What? I thought these things came with cheese.
I thought the box said 'cheese included.'
I got it from Eekea, you're gonna love it!
Ever since PETA stepped in, they let us conduct our own experiments.
You can always tell when the instructions were written by someone who doesn't speak Mouse.
‘We better call Chip and Joanna’
I got the fire insurance, did you bring the matches?
They say that we are as smart as dogs, so lets just go in there and poop.
IKEA cheese better be great!
They say it raises the IQ
What did you expect?  NIH grants haven't gone up in years.
It says here the cheese isn’t included.
Listen, Einstein, we only have an hour, so let's spend the first 55 minutes to make sure we understand the problem.
Forget the directions! We’re making it a straight shot to the cheese.
The best laid plans of mice.
I'll help you Jerry, but I think this is what your therapist meant when he said you self-sabotage.
I can't make heads or tails of it."
Wouldn't you know, we're missing a part - the cheese.
I thought we agreed you wouldn't order things I have to assemble.
Rats! It didn't come with a ferris wheel.
Relax, it's not rocket science.
Mickey’s parents paid a contractor to build his maze.
Just in case we screw this up, let's eat before we start.
Screw it, let's cut to the cheese.
That was some good cheese, now let's get to work on this.
You just had to go to IKEA...
It says we were supposed to eat the reward last.
I'm thinking open kitchen, marble floor...
It's a bit of a fixer-upper, but it's in a good neighbourhood, and the price was right.
The three most scary words in the English language are "easy to assemble.
I don't care how much you like the meatballs, we aren't going back there.
Apparently we have to supply the cheese.
Long story short, lab funding's been cut.
It's either this or a better mousetrap.
When all else fails, eat the instructions!
Do you have any idea what happened to the cheese that came with the kit?
I’m tellin’ ya, Mort, an escape room franchise is a smart investment right now.
Ok I give up.  Call Ikea helpline.
You got the cheese, right?
So, do you still think it wasn't worth the $10 to have it pre-assembled?
Hey. let's do Mies van der Rohe this time.
It needs more food pellet dispensers and less electric shock grids.
Sure we can! Then watch the look on their idiot faces when we run it in record time.
It's called a maze, it will keep us busy for hours!!!
If we build it, they will come--and give us treats.
Apparently, we were supposed to set this up, THEN eat the cheese.
All I know is that the second mouse always gets the cheese!
These PhDs sure are getting lazy.
Two extra screws, no cheese.
It looked easier to assemble in the Ikea showroom.
Damn it, 2 screws short.
I'm confused. How do we know when we are finished?
I say we wait and see where she puts the cheese first.
It won’t matter how we build the maze since there’s no exit.
Well, looks like he finally got Mexico to PAY for it but I’m not sure they sent the right plans.
Cheese not included? You and your bright ideas.
How's your Swedish?
They're testing our marriage."
You're not going to believe this. 
Musfälla is Swedish for MOUSETRAP!
The fact that we ate the cheese already gives me even less motivation to build this.
You thought they'd build the maze for us? In this economy?
Damn! Cheese not included!
Let's just eat the cheese now and call it a day.
You know, I’m not really all that hungry.
Wouldn't it be simpler to join a gym?
Since we don’t speak a language, I am so glad IKEA prints their directions in pictures
Wish I could read.
We can do this, Frank. Let's build a mousetrap we can live in!
Apparently, whatever they're feeding us has made us smarter than the senate committee that funds our study.
who's ikea was this?
If we build it they will come... and put cheese in it.
WAIT A MINUTE......... EXACTLY WHY ARE WE BUILDING A BETTER MOUSETRAP?
There are easier ways to get cheese, you know.
You can really get lost in these instructions!
I can't make head nor tail of these instructions!
Human engineering: no purpose, no privacy, no way out.
We have to start over. It says to build the inside walls first.
The good think about a do-it-yourself maze is that we can place the cheese right at the entry.
If  we  build it,they will come--and put  cheese in it.
The scientists have taken the IKEA thing too far
It's actually a 1:500 scale model of their store.
It was cheaper from Ikea.
I thought you said this came with cheese.
I'm thinking clean, streamlined, functional - bringing the Baumaus style into interior maze design.
I wanted an artisanally-chewed warren, but this is so much cheaper
Just our luck! The fine print: Cheese not included.
I say we rent the maze instead.
I told you the cheese is not included!
I’ve checked twice, they left out the cheese
Seems like too damn much work for a piece of cheese.
A Wall, he wants us to build a wall?
Are you sure we're not looking at plans for a better mousetrap?
What is a screwdriver?
If our relationship can survive building it, running it will be a piece of cake.
Really? Just six screws, an allen wrench and these instructions??? And all along we've been thinking the humans are the smart ones."
We should have known something was up when Dr. Jorgen announced he was ‘off to IKEA!’
We shouldn't have solved those earlier ones so quickly, how long now before we get fed?
Made in the USA! Why are the directions in Chinese?
I'm sorry, but the directions are written in Gerbil.
Trust me, honey. I read a lot of design magazines. Open concept is over.
Oh, oh. The directions are in Swedish"
Hey we are missing the most important piece...wait a minute, Scott, your breath smells like cheese.
The faster we build this, the faster we can flip it.
Oh Mickey, I'm so excited ! A labyrinth of our very own !
That’s right—f we build it, they will come. With cheese.
It was a nice dream, but let's return to our respective attics with a shred of dignity intact.
But wait, maybe we're thinking out side the box?
You’re the one who said putting it together would be as easy as running through it.
This is why we read the directions, Phil. It says here not to eat the cheese yet.
It's what you get for buying the maze at Ikea
Why do humans make everything so complicated?
no problem, it will be a snap to put it together you said
I'll bet you I can build a better one.
Pay attention to the instruction so we don't get lost like last time.
Why don't we just put the cheese at the front?
Wow, this is the first time I've ever actually built one!
I'm trying to recreate a Billy bookcase hack I saw on Pinterest.
You're right, we should screw this.
This seems like a lot of work and running around.  Tell me again why we can't just eat the cheese?
Is this some kind of a test?
Can you read Ikea pictures ?
Yup, it's a better mousetrap.
Even worse, apparently the cheese is sold separately.
Wait, these instructions are in Swedish.
I'm telling ya, in order to get the paper in we've gotta fold it and then pivot!
I’ll figure this out. You go find some cheese.
Now, hold each part of the trap in your paws, and ask yourself if it sparks joy.
If it makes you feel better, humans don't understand IKEA instructions either.
What if we went with an open floor plan, and added a roof instead?
Hear me out: We put the cheese in the foyer.
Forget the home. Let’s build a maze instead.
Listen, I'm happy they bought us this new house. I'm just a little cautious about installing a spring-loaded bed with a cast-iron jaw.
What good is a maze without the cheese?
Darn it. Can we same day cheese on Amazon?
get sven. it's from Ikea.
Pretty sure that 'If you build it, they will come.' doesn't apply here."
I have to admit it. I’m lost.
If we build it, they'll hide crumbs
Oh god. It’s from IKEA?!
I want an open concept and large cedar closet.
Scoff if you must, Walter.  I say with these plans we are masters of our own destiny.
Or, a feng shui approach with no turns.
Of course..."Mâze"...why didn't I see that before?
I thought we were never buying from Ikea again?!
Just remember, the best laid plans of mice and men can go awry
Is it just me or is the scientist getting lazy?
So you can speak and comprehend Swedish, but you can't read it?
If you can figure this out, you don't need to take the test.
I think it's a trap!
He said it would easier to navigate if we built it ourselves!
You always said you wanted a house you could get lost in.
They call it the Mäze.
You say they got a research grant from Ikea?
“What’s the point? There’s no cheese included.”
They’re starting to expect too much out of us, Jerry.
Don't you just hate it when they drop off these IKEA kits and we have to put it together ourselves
Let's put an end to this maze before morning. I'll chew the long rectangles, you take the squares.
This would be easier if we had hands like Mickey.
Now they want us to build it too, typical...
Do you ever feel that life's just too much of a rat race?
I think we have to construct our own maze....but make it simple enough that those guys in white coats can figure it out!
Maze building feels more rewarding than working in the trap factory.
I wish you weren’t always trying to save money with this do-it-yourself  stuff.
This is a test of patience, not ability.
Memorize these plans.
I say, Let's not over think this.
I'm nervous about the location of the catwalk.
I know it says "labyrint" in Swedish, but let's build a rental unit instead.
Ten times larger and we’ve got the cat.
No cheese and now we have to build our own maze!
We should have paid the $99 and had IKEA do it.
I've heard that only us Swedish mice have to assemble their own mazes.
So, by doing it this way we can get to the cheese every time, right?
I feel kinda awkward assembling mouse traps, but the
cheese offer was just too good to pass!
Next, they'll ask us to make the cheese.
With careful placement we can turn it into a bowling alley.
I told you we should have gotten the Flueggen instead of the Strutenogen!
You had to buy it at Ikea didn't ya?
Putting it together is the real test of intelligence.
Personally, I think that building it will be it's own reward.
I wanted the door to have a rounded top.
Damn, we're missing the cheese!
I mean how good can IKEA cheese be anyway?
It's Kushner's Middle East Peace Plan...it needs some work!
I've checked the materials and the schematics. Not a scrap of cheese anywhere.
I'm not sure we should do this; that Ikea cashier looked an awful lot like a cat.
On second thought, let's go with the open-office concept.
This will be easy, are you a mouse or a man?
No....I said "Marry me and our whole life will be aMAZEing"
⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  ⭐️ ⭐️ 
A maze of instructions for a maze , will buy this product again “
It's backwards - the cheese should be at the end......
But once we figure it out, they’ll just move the cheese again
This could be aMazing!!
Won't they be amazed!
This isn't a house - it's a trap!
You millennials don’t get it.  It’s not to make reaching the cheese harder, it’s to keep the cats out.
I have the feeling that we shouldn't have accepted this job.
The really expect us to build an Ikea?
It has no exit. Run.
It’s my least favorite part of Christmas Eve.
The real test here will be on our relationship.
It's gonna be all left turns to the cheese - we tell the others, skew the data, look like genius mice, and the grad student gave me $50 already to put it together!
Don’t go in there, it’s a trap!
You've got to be kidding -- Swedish??
Ernie, so help me... if this is a trap, I’m just going to scream...
And that, my friend, is how you unbuild a better mousetrap.
Remember when it was just finding the cheese?
Why put up the walls at all?
I don't need this aggravation Ralph! Let's go back to our traditional hole in the wall!
Trust me; I was in the control group last week. These instructions are wrong. The HAND just wants to see how we resolve conflict.
You do it. Amaze me.
Do you know how many mice would kill for a job at IKEA?
Elmer, I was using Trojan Horse as a metaphor.
On second thought, I think I want an open concept maze.
Now they’re just getting lazy.
I sure wish PETA would intervene.
Apparently, a guy named Allen left his wrench in the box.  And no:  I don't know why.
The cat told me he'd put it together for us. Might be worth the risk.
Everyone is going to make a joke about IKEA, let’s think outside box.
I love shopping at Icheesa
How about if we seal up  the box and address it to be mailed to  Hawaii?
All this for a Swedish meatball?
The real puzzle here is how this idea got past the ethics review.
I think I'll take my chances in the terrarium
I know there’s an IKEA joke in there somewhere.  Looks like we’ll have to make it ourselves”
Ready for some sweat equity?
Aside from missing screws and incomprehensible instructions, the reward for completion is not cheese but a garage sale ready book shelf.
Are you sure labyrint means bookcase?
I want the corner office.
No more rat-race! Let's leave it open plan.
I never said I could read. I thought you could.
I'm thinking an open concept maze so we can entertain while we find the cheese
This time, more rooms and less neverending twisted hallway from hell!
Let's just go back to squatting.
Is there an 800 number?
They must be graduate student researchers.
It's a good thing I can read Swedish.
If you go with our basic ergonomic floor plan, it’s just one zig and one zag and you’ve got your treat.
I hate being used in research funded by IKEA.
Well mister-save-some-money  -  TOLD you we shoulda paid Ikea to assemble it first !
I still think putting together the kids swing set was more difficult!
I do not think it is a good idea if we build a better mouse trap.
Once again, it’s HR trying to justify their existence.
I say we put the maze together ourselves. That way we get the cheese every time."
I promise you, it's not a trap.
If we build it, cheese will come.
The guy at IKEA said it would take an hour to assemble.
I wish they would include some captions with these cartoon directions.
What if we just refuse to do it?
It's time to call IKEA.
Build it and the cheese will come.
It'd be easier if we just built one big, beautiful wall.
If we build this we get a...What's a PhD?
No, the lab assistant and the cheese are sold separately.
I don’t have a problem with the way it is now.
We’re gonna build a wall the biggest wall the world has ever seen.
Amazing space! Thank you, dear, for dismantling the partitions. I so much do prefer the open floorplan.
See? I told you the cheese isn't included.
I'm embarrassed to say that I don't even know how to use a mouse let alone AI.
But what if it's a trap?
Funding cuts.
It's not a maze, they're testing build-your-own condos.
To me, of course, this is normal sized print.
This is a musfälla Karen! Not a råttspel!
We never follow directions.  Why start now?
I can’t see us getting to the end.
Since you already ate the cheese, there's no point in putting this thing together.
It's about time the white-coats started asking open-ended questions.
I’d feel more motivated if it came with cheese.
It’s just my opinion, of course, but I don’t think we should be helping them build a better mousetrap.
It's the corporate model so we'll have to move our own cheese too.
The human equivalent is called socialism
With one entry, it looks like we can check in any time we want.
I thought you ordered the one with cheese!!!!
In graduate school we design the maze.
Forget the maze, I say we go condo!
I heard government funding for research has been cut, but I didn’t know it was this bad.
I wonder what M O U S E T R A P spells?
Do you get the feeling we've become dupes of mail order consumerism?
Trust me. I've got this.
Who Moved My Cheese?" made a lot more sense before open offices were a thing
Where do we put the restroom and gift shop?
I hear these IKEA builds can make or break relationships.
I hate this IKEA bullshit.
Why is there always one screw missing?
I'm sure it's good—Jerry's never even come out of his!
They say it's the true test of a relationship.
This is great Geoffrey. The kids will never find us.
They're scientists, they wouldn't have forgotten to give us something!
Oh, great. It says 'Jarlsberg sold separately.'
It's right here in the fine print: 'Cheese not included.'
They don't say anything about opposable thumbs
I know! I can call my 
cousin Mikea Mouse!
Or, we could just eat the cheese.
The box made it look like it came with cheese.
This is the Flurn maze! I told you I wanted the Biilke!
Wait: what does TRAP mean?
It was designed by Jean-Paul Sartre.
After we swap out a safe room for the hallway of doom, I say we hide the cheese there.
Shoot.  The directions are in French!
It's from the committee on airport security management.
Why bother? Everyone's looking for open concept these days anyway.
I was hoping we could have the space be more of an open plan
But will this be enough wall to satisfy the base?
Dammit, it's all color-coded.
Don't worry. I put an electroshock machine together with my ex.
Keep this on the dl but let me tell you a little something about the so called Stockholm Syndrome
I miss Tom.
What do you say  we skip the next five steps,throw these pieces out, then we won't have to waste time getting to the other end?
I could do this blindfolded.
Yeah, I guess eating the cheese first sort of defeats the purpose...
It’s amazing. They didn’t include any exits in these plans!
And that’s how we’ll trap the humans.
It's called reverse engineering.
But condos would give us a better return on investment!
They keep raising the bar.
Yes, but should we build a better mousetrap?
We'll need a room for aging cheese.
Screw the directions. We can figure it out.
Instructions?  I don’t need no stinkin’ instructions!
Put the cheese in first.
Go to the Internet and see if there’s a workaround
If we do this right we can get cheese anytime we want!
If we build it our selves the cheese will be ours in no time.
I heard that Ikea was the funding source for the experiment.
Curse you Larry! What would possess you to buy the "mouse-träap" house from IKEA?
These Scandinavian experiments have the sleek and modern look of much more expensive experiments.
It's not from IKEA. It's from the Farmer in the Dell. We might as well give up for it says in the end the cheese stands alone.
Should we take some LSD?
I think it's another experiment on learned helplessness.
Know anybody that can read Swedish?
I prefer Swiss cheese to Swedish architecture.
Ever since CRISPR, they keep raising the bar.
But I own Boardwalk!
Hold on, I smell a rat!
Check the box again; the cheese is missing.
I think I prefer the open concept.
If we do this right, will they let us live?
You’ve read “Flowers for Algernon,” right?
I hear the new lab director is Swedish.
Sure it's an astounding maze but what if we forget the solution, Algernon?
You know what they say about the best laid plans....
When I said, “The best-laid plans of mice and men,” I was not referring to IKEA.
You know what I could go for right now? A meatball.
Trust me. It will be amazing.
I never used an Allen wrench before.
Don't sweat our lack of thumbs.  We're paid by the hour.
Why did you buy the 'Cheese Not Included' version?
Insert IKEA joke here.
If adding an extra turn last time made the researchers run around the lab, let's add two this time.
Lets do it... 
With these plans not even a GPS could find us
Wait a minute...there's no cheese included...!
Whose idea was it to buy an IKEA escape room?
We’re lost.
On second thought, let's go with an open-office plan.
You know, we could have skipped all this and just ordered the cheese instead.
Are you sure this is part of our contract ?
No, It’s not a trap. Stop being so paranoid!
Once we build this, have you considered the impact on future generations?
Why make it hard on ourselves..?
Not fair! We get the ugly box stores and Slartibartfast gets the Fjords!
Good golly Hermie, we've stumbled upon the plans.
I say we go with the open floor plan.
A new home is a big infestment.
Cheese isn't on the parts list.
Yes!  I do want it to look like a maze.  Everyone in my 
family has mastered a maze at least once in their lifetime!
Should we just go with the open office concept?
I just want to make sure I get to keep my office, even after the baby.
We’ve got to return this. It’s missing the cheese.
Go get your mother.
I say we should just call IKEA and ask.
We still have 2 screws from the last one, so this should be enough for the diningroom table when we're done.
Forget the instructions, I say we just make a hallway directly to the cheese...
These are always missing a part
Think you can build a better mousetrap?
No Betty, we don't need to call for help, I can figure this out.
Son, I've told you time and again, you set your own mousetrap or someone else will set one for you.
Don’t give me that look. We knew getting it home would be the easy part!
This will be the ultimate test of our relationship
Man, talk about getting lost in your work...
Why do they think we like mazes?
We're agreed? Cheese accessible, no corner office?
You put the damn thing together; you're the one who insisted on going to Ikea.
It's true. The best-laid plains of mice and men often do go awry.
Whddaya mean you forgot the Swedish meatballs??
Let's check YouTube for a video.
Agreed, cheese goes in every corner.
Umm, can we just cut to the cheese?
We have to go back...I can't find the cheese.
That didn't take long to disassemble.
How to Make a Cat Trap
The price was great, but these instructions are in Swedish.
Looks suspicious. All hallways.
Apparently they got their research funding from Ikea.
So what do we do with Tabby after we catch her?
The only part that seems to be missing is the cheese, Lewis.
But I've been working so hard to break the walls down between us.
Ikea thinks anything we can assemble humans can assemble"
Bad news. I think we’re missing parts.
We already built a better mousetrap. This can't be difficult.
Lets  just bell the cat
The hell with it!  Let's leave it open.
I can build it myself. We don't need to hire contractors!
I didn't even know IKEA had a lab!
I think we need IKEA for dummies.
But look, if we skip to step 17, we can eat the cheese now, then just circle back later when we feel like it.
Isn't this cheating?
Screw it.  Put the cheese in, eat the cheese.  Done!
Okay, say we get it done.  How’s it gonna bring the cheese?
The seeds are missing. I ordered a maize kit.
An Open Floor Plan sounds like a good idea. You know what else sounds like a good idea? Free cheese. That's how they got Billy.
Promise me it is the last time we buy a maze at Ikea...
I've always wanted an open floor plan.
This says that it is supposed to come with cheese.
We've got to go back to IKEA for the cheddarskoort.
C'mon, the cuts to the research budget mean we all have to pitch in a little more.
I thought you said you had built plenty of hice?
Let’s think outside the box. How about we construct a house instead?
Say, "It's going to be Ahh-MAZING" one more time and you're on your own.
I must admit, when Dr Skinner said he was going on a research trip to Sweden this was not what I envisaged.
Damn it Louise, they left out the cheese!
And they said this would be a piece of cheese...
This is what happens when they move the cheese.
Do they really need us in order to study IKEA's effect on relationships?
First they make us run it, then they make us build it. A-maze-ing what they put us through.
Great, but where does the cheese go?
Wait a minute.  Do we have opposable thumbs?
Did you buy this from Ikea”
Your cousin Mikea sent it.
'We're IKEA's new target demographic!'
It's like scanning my own groceries.
This will really screw up their experiment.
I hate you
How come we always end up with dead end jobs?
They used to let us smoke.
This is more bewildering than the maze!
I hate HATE Ikea.
Build it and cheese will come.
I don't speak any of these languages.
Is it just me or are these mazes getting way more complex?
I can assure you, once assembled, it will lead to Swedish meatballs!
So here is where we place the diversion for Tom.
Now they want us to build our own maze?  Screw that!
I'll make the cocaine dispenser.
How's your Chinese?
Another Day, Another ‘Acting’ Cabinet Secretary
this doesn't look victorian era to me.
If there's one lesson you take from your father's death, I hope it's this—always use the instructions.
When's it gonna look like a wheel?
They make you do so much more these days for your cheese.
While they build a better mousetrap, we will build a better mouse hole.
Really, this time IKEA has just gone too far!
It feels like we are trying to reinvent the wheel.
No worries ... I’ve drawn up some counterfeit plans for their “better mousetrap” design.
I think IKEA has a YouTube video for this.
Who's supplying the cheese?
The fools! Now when they put us in here we'll know where the treat is every time!
You forgot the cheese.
Dammit! They forgot the cheese.
What say we ask for the cheese up-front?"
I like the "open floor plan" option.
Don't worry, I've done this a hundred times.
I should have guessed, 'No cheese included.'
Any more budget cuts and they'll shut down the lab completely.
Let them build a better mousetrap. We'll build a better bungalow.
‘So now you tell me you can’t read?’
I'll get the cheese
I assumed cheese was included.
Fuck it - Let's raid the pantry.
I'm gerrymandering the maze, so I'll always win.
Frankly,I reckon gnawing a hole in the skirting board is much quicker.
It says there's supposed to be a brick of cheese, did you eat it?!
First , we need to learn how to read.....
I thought YOU could read Swedish!
I say we put the cheese in the entrance and screw the rest.
hmmm, is THIS our test, or is THAT our
 test?
We seem to be missing a block of cheese.
I'm lost already. Let's just forget it.
It's amazing how they can make these instructions so that anyone can read them...
You said we were only getting the meatballs.
This wall will definitely put an end to the migrant mice problem.
Sometimes I feel like these designers are just testing us.
And then we'll look brilliant -- looking like we never saw it before.
Where are the little meatballs?
This is the last time I buy anything from Ikea
Couldn't we just order the cheese?
Oh my God! It’s a trap.
I'm building a better mousetrap.
I feel like this would be a lot easier with opposable thumbs
The YouTube video was no help at all!
Of course, they have to kill us after we finish it.
I thought YOU knew how to read.
It’s written in Swedish.
With the right jerrymandering, we can always get the cheese!
Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just order it from Amazon already assembled?"
It’s a Jean-Paul Sartre maze kit - no exit.
Can we just skip to the wine pairings?
Option A is "Build a Wall." Option B is "Create a Maze of Bureaucracy."
I think an open floorplan would be less stressful.
Be careful so we can get a good sub-let.
Back in the day, all we had to do was run the maze not build it.
Looks like we have reached Level II.
No, I thought YOU were getting the permits.
I told you not to buy IKEA.
Remember when employers used to assemble these things?
Do you really think the cat’s going to fall for this?
But where will we put the bidet?
Look, Lloyd, if you're going to just keep eating the cheese before we begin, then this whole exercise is pointless.
These assembly instructions are clear. Still, they will be challenging for male humans.
These NIH budget cuts are really starting to bug me.
Did I misread smorgasboard ?
Do you think those those Task Rabbits in the next lab would put this together for us for a reasonable price?
This is a lot of trouble for a small piece of moldy cheese.
This is going to be a-maze-ing!
So, do you want the master bath or the walk- in closet?
Ikea wants  to see if we can assemble it faster than humans.
So you pay a little extra, but at least you know you'll get the cheese.
I can't read this.
Well, getting there is half the fun.
It is going to be easy and if hear Mexico is going to pay for it.
But... I thought the Minotaur costume was included."

- Maisie Jacobson, Toronto, Canad
Remind me again why we are doing this ?
I read that in one recent animal study, 42% of humans failed to complete a similar task, and of those, 18% experienced a precipitous increase in all-cause mortality within two years.
It says right here: Cheese sold separately.
What did I tell you before you ordered it? It’s in the fine print, “Cheese not included.”
They don’t include the cheese?
Designing them gives me agency.
Aren’t AP classes fun?
HOW TO BUILD A BETTER MOUSETRAP????                                                                                  Yikes, I thought it was a maze.
will they make us get our own funding next?
I know we need the exercise, but wouldn’t it just be easier to switch to low-fat cheese?
We can still return this, right?
We can give ourselves the larger bedroom...
I just didn’t know you were into the whole maze thing.
Oh, great.  It says here— ‘Cheese Not Included.’
Im not saying that it’s a trap, but I think that there is only one way in.
Let's build it with an escape tunnel underneath like El Chapo.
With all the budget cuts, we have to build the our own mazes,
but at least we still have our jobs.
It still doesn't look like a cat trap to me!
Why are the leftover parts never cheese?
I suspect they'll also ask us to do the rest of the experiment for just cheese.
I regret asking management for more responsibility.
Ikea, why?
But why are we trying to build a birdhouse anyway?
Don't look at me. I just went for the meatballs.
I prefer an open concept layout.
Is it still an escape room if we see the instructions?
This is a piece of cake, but where should we hide the cheese?
-ing. It could be a-maz-ing.
Sure, we can build one, but who's gonna test it?
The Lab Guy shops at Ikea.
You got this at Ikea....right?
I thought the catalog said cheese was included.
What about a mud room to the right,and then a central corridor with the kids rooms on either side?
What part about the A before B theory of causality don’t you understand?
This is what separates us from the lower mammals.
We should’ve hired a task rabbit.
I''ve heard of reverse psychology, but this ridiculous!
Is "Ikea" too obvious a caption?
I preferred it when they only expected us to run the maze.
You know,we could always hire a Task Rabbit.
So simple, even an American can do it.
Stockholm what?
My shrink suggested it.
I’m hoping that if we figure this out we’ll attract the attention of the Nobel committee in Sweden.
Oops! This is the Mexican border kit!
I still think calling taskrabbit would have been less scary.
It's going to be a lot like trying to find your way around Ikea.
No wonder the humans hate IKEA.
I've never built a big one square foot house before.
We used to compete for pellets.  Now we collaborate for room and board.
Just tell me where the mouse trap is.”
Helen T. Stafford, New York, N
Looks like someone let the cat out of the bag.  Maybe I should rephrase that…
I TOLD you we shouldn't go to IKEA!
This seems to be a lot of  work just to do a lot of work when we're done.
No way I will get it finished for the kids’ Christmas morning.
The instructions for this Ikea pre-fab home is like solving one of those freakin' cheese mazes
We have to build our own tests now?
The directions are in Mandarin.
Why don't we put the cheese right at this end?
It’s the IKEA lab.
Um, it says here 'Cheese not included.' What the &*#@!
Think 'Myth of Sisyphus' with a little Friedrich Nietzsche thrown in.
They expect us to build a better mousetrap?
I'm not sure. The box said it's called "Irrgång"
Let's go to Lab 72 and let this cheapo build his own damn maze.
It doesn’t matter whether we follow the instructions. There’s no exit on the other side anyway.
I thought you were getting the cheese.
It came from the Psychology Department at Ikea.
I'm telling you, Jerry, once we memorize the escape route, they won't inject us anymore.
What’s a wing nut?
C'mon Jimmy, this isn't rocket science.
We haven't even built it, and I'm already lost.
Let's forget the bookcase and just build a maze.
Of course, the instructions would be much easier to follow if we could read.
I’m lost, Gerald.
Let’s make the maze spell “Out”—that’ll get ‘em.
I suppose next they’ll expect us to write up the experimental results.
What?! It says the cheese is
sold separately!
Are you SURE this is just another book shelf?
Do we really want the world beating a path to our door?
Would you rather be building a better mousetrap?
Let's call Skinner, he'll know what to do!!!
You told me that the cheese was included
Time to call Ikea customer support.
Yeh baby, we’re in management now!!
I really thought we would have an infrastructure bill by now.
The instructions are in Swedish. Can you read Swedish?
Itty bitty sanctuary city.
Ikea says: you move your cheese.
I think this would be easier if you didn't have to Mouseplain everything.
Get on YouTube and check videos for IKEA mouse maze
Some assembly required.
What's the point without cheese?
I know it's complicated, but the Swedish meatballs are worth it.
What's the point?  They didn't send the cheese.
If we make it through, we get a Swedish meatball.
I agree with you, Harvey, but Dr. Mendel wants us to think outside the box.
Did you eat the cheese?
Our marriage is about to be tested like it never has before.
These instructions are the real maze.
I really think we should take out this wall to open up the floor plan.
Apparently, the cheese is 'sold separately' ".
I told you IKEA would have it.
It looked simpler in the Ikea catalog!
This is going nowhere.
This looks like a BJÖRKSNÄS from IKEA!
This furniture from I-Squeeka is amazing!
It came from Ikea - how hard can it be?
I thought that cheese was included"
I told you the cheese was sold separately.
Of course it’s a test!  Why else would they ask US to build it?
It’s for the kids. I need to get it set up  by December 24th.
But it’s written in Swedish!!
It’s supposed to be the latest in exercise equipment.
I'm from Norway not Sweden.
Call me a hopeless romantic, but I hope to birth at least 83 children in our new house, within the next 2-3 years, because I love you, and know no other way.
Do you want cheese or not?
But it says we need someone named Allen.
"Yes, the instructions are in Swedish, but it's not like either of us can even read English.
Hmm. 'Cheese not included.' I just don't see the point.
I’m not building it.  Despite what we’ve been promised, I don’t believe Mexico will pay for this.
At least they're not making us pay for it, too!
You’ll need to get a variance from the city. You must have at least two points of egress with this kind of square millimeterage.
What? No cheese?
IKEA, apparently, has moved the cheese.
These instructions are a maze.
These damn Ikea mazes always come with a couple screws missing.
PETA files lawsuit against Ikea over animal testing."
Once it's assembled, it will provide an endless lifetime supply of cheese.
As far as Ikea is concerned, we might as well be three blind mice.
I think there’s a piece missing. Can you see anything that looks like a piece of cheese?
Well, to begin with, none of those boards have a  “B” on them.
I’m designing my career. Of course there’s no exit.
Says here the reward for completing this one is a 'sense of accomplishment'"
I got Swedish meatballs for when we finish
What was wrong with living in a hole
in the wall?
Is cheese really worth all of this work?
I think I'd be more motivated if we started with the cheese.
I think we were supposed to wait to eat the cheese.
White-glove assembly was extra, Sharon.
God damn it. Do you want a maze or do you want an "open concept?"
This blueprint’s a maze!
Wait a minute - did you remember to order the cheese?
I can't read either, what do you think they want us to do this time?
We found the answer key!
i  thought a few practice runs would give us an edge
What do you mean, there are always parts left over?
Of course I'm conflicted, but it's a job.
No, that's the trap door for the cat, THIS is the door to the cheese cellar!
Funny that IKEA decided to sell a scale model of their own store.
And now you see that cheese is not included
It says here we're apparently supposed to stay inside the maze at all times.
Ok, let's make it eight blind alleys.
This is no Gouda.
I told you IKEA furniture is impossible to build.
They said,’’some’ assembly required.
What I want to know is "Where's the cheese?"
If we build it better- what's the catch?
It wasn’t my idea to get a fixer-upper.
Do we really need a bathroom ?
So what you're saying is there was never any cheese at all.
Should’ve never taken that promotion.
Well, honey, remember you're the one who didn't want to pay for the assembly package.
Don't look at the instructions, I want to get lost.
Honestly, why bother?  It says right here: ‘Cheese wedge not included.’’
No, it's not a minimalist structure.
Don't you think that if they let us build it any results would be biased?
What are you, blind? It already offers an open concept.”
Oh of course. Cheese not included.
If we can follow our noses through a maze, we can follow IKEA instructions.
If we remember how we designed this thing, we can navigate it in record time.  Dr. Verner will be so impressed.  He might even write an article about us in that Journal he reads all the time!
But if we build a sauna instead of a maze, we can jerk around the neuroscientists.
Let's not, and say we did!
Maybe they won’t notice.
This plan is missing something ,who cut the cheese
It's from Sweden; says to use Swiss cheese once assembled, but American cheese will have to do.
They didn't tell us there was a monthly subscription!
Does it not concern you even a bit that the name of this thing is Muztrop?
This is all in Spanish
Ever feel like you're your own worst enemy?
There must be some kind of big reward if we can do all of this. Screw cheese I’m talking Miami.
Let's grab a six pack and put on The Who.
I'm not digging the parmesan sandbox...
‘Ain’t gonna be much of a challenge if the entry and exit points are the same, eh?’
A bit suspicious that all the pieces are here except for the cheese
It's time we talked about your cheese addiction.
If we memorize this, it isn't cheating.  We'll break the record, have a snack and get home early.
This is too good to be true!
These drugs don't work.
Cat got your tongue?
After we build it researchers will reward us with many treats.
Forget their maze.  Let’s build a ladder and bust outta here.
And so we get to build our own unique health care policy with these set of options.
You ordered this without the cheese?
When will it end? First it was eat the cheese. Then it was find the cheese and eat it. Now we have to assemble the maze?
Tell me again how this is supposed to help my anxiety.
Go ahead Mr. Big Wig with the college degree, tell us what the blueprint says.
I look forward to the day when we can afford something better than Ikea.
After we assemble this, let's run some trials to see which responses will produce the greatest rewards.
Don't look at me. I needed extended time on my SATs.
These instructions are for how to build a better mousetrap.  But we're not gonna follow these instructions, are we?
I don't read Swedish.
This is a-maze-ing! . . . A Japanese garden with Swedish directions!
If this works, do you think the world will beat a path to our door?
Easy in, easy out, that’s the plan.
I do not see my lactose-free cheese listed.
Next thing you know, they'll have us milking the cow!
So do you really think we're going to win the science competition this year?
Do you know anyone at Ikea?
Well, looks like he finally got his wall. Let's do something amazing with these leftover parts.
This research role responsibilities are increasing exponentially
Let’s just eat the cheese now and forget the instructions.
I’m drawing the line at data collection.
We can't read, we're mice.
Fuckin' Ikea man. Fucking capitalist pigs. Couldn't even include one single extra goddamn screw. Fuck me.
[No caption necessary.]
All I wantedwas the meatballs
It says you may need help with this step from a cat.
I told you we should have bought this pre-assembled.
You're right, Martha, Ikea stores really ARE a maze.
Is this part of every job interview?
I feel like you're testing me.
You'd better go find the box of bits left over from the last "build it yourself" project, you know we'll be missing something.
We're out of cheese.  Why are we building this again?
It SAID no assembly required!!
You put up the walls, I’ll find the cheese.”
Let them figure out there own maze !
It says 'build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door'.
I'm lost.
Why do you always fall for these DIY projects
I don’t know either.  Let’s just assume that the end justifies the means.
Let's put the food next to the door.
If we get it right, we get meatballs.
Ernie, why are we contributing to our own downfall?
We could learn Swedish, but I say we just buy the cheese.
Our great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers had it so much easier.
I'm doing it for the Swedish meatballs.
It looks like a slippery slope.
Trust me!  What makes it better is that we serve the guests cheese in the entry hall.
Or we could just take the path of least resistance...
You know, this whole maze thing would be a lot easier if we just skipped this part.
You just had  to move the cheese didn’t you.
I suppose we could just gnaw a finish hole.
I like the open floor plan as is.  We're done.
Sure, it's more work, but at least I'm my own boss.
I just don't get the open-concept trend.
Wait!  Is this part of the test?
It’s a DIY maze from IKEA, but you have to supply the cheese yourself.
If you build it, they'll get lost.
Do they think we're stupid?  We know a mousetrap from a maze any day.
They want us to make our own labyrinth?
In my day, all you had to do was find your way through it.
I hear anyone can make it in the real estate development business these days.
Don't despair! Ikea has a Maze-Yourself hotline.
I told you we had to buy the cheese separately
I KNOW THE DIRECTIONS DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE NOW,BUT I PROMISE YOU'LL BE AMAZED WHEN WE'VE FINISHED.
They say it's a piece of cheese to assemble.
I doubt any of the 2020 candidates will get through this one!
Compared to our human trap, this is a slice of cheese!
I know this looks complicated but just imagine how rewarding it's going to be at the end.
Or, we can just wing it
If cheese is sold separately, why not just buy cheese?
I guess we were supposed to save the cheese for the end.
Let's not figure this out. If we do, they'll have us put together all their Ikea furniture.
I'm not sure this is worth it without the cheese.
Nice... but what are we going to do with a liquor cabinet?
How will we ever get it out the door?
This maze is called an office cubicle.
I give up. Let’s call a TaskRabbit.
It says here, ‘cheese not included.’
It says, "Cheese, sold separately".
I'm pretty sure the cheese was included.
Ever feel like things exist just to test you?
If we put this maze together, they'll give us cheese.
At least it’ll be easier to find the cheese.
Build it and rewards will come.
Let’s toss the damn thing and just eat the cheese.
I smell a rat in these instructions!
You only make it LOOK hard, so we look like geniuses!
We can't reward them.  They left out three screws and the cheese.
I thought you said you spoke IKEA.
Rats! I think we are missing the cheese.
They always leave out one screw.
So, how much was the assembly fee?
So they’re not even giving us sugar anymore?
And here's the best part: we pretend we don't know our way through! Just to mess with them.
Are you sure this is where you want it?
I'm having doubts about this getting us any extra cheese.
It's from Sweden. Norway Rats have nothing to do with Ikea.
A Cheese Maze? Why can't we just eat the cheese now and call it a day?
I'm finally getting my Mickey cave.
To me it's all about the Gouda, the Roquefort, the Camembert.
We're never shopping at IKEA again!
See, it says it right here:  'cheese NOT included.'
duuude! the instructions are the real labyrinth!
Why are the directions in Swedish?"
No, this is not like cheating on the SATs: it' s more like due diligence in advance.
I heard DIY is all the rage in research these days.
This would probably go easier if we hadn't eaten the cheese first.
This whole process appears to be counterproductive.
No exit. This isn’t a maze.  It’s a TRAP!
You don’t need to be Frank Lloyd Rat to realize this is a poor design.
The directions are from IKEA. This should be easy.
This IKEA furniture is so great!
It's the federal funding cutbacks.  We have to build our own now.
Did you bring the cheese?
Apparently you also have to provide your own cheese.
Is Ikea-ed a verb?
And why would we hide our food?
When we’re done it will be just like the maze at any IKEA store.
This could be a trap.
Build a better mouse trap and the world will beat a path to your door.  Build your own maze and they'll bring cheese. Get moving.
Oh no, it looks like the directions went through google translate. Do you see a 'planken' marked '%6 and a 'pinner' marked '&8'? Also keep an eye out for any 'soft flaux' ,whatever that is.
Cheez Louise!
Billy has the measles but we can still win first place at the science fair.
I feel like we’ve hit a wall.
These cartoon people are cute, but would it kill them to include some words in the instructions?
Think Frank Lloyd Wright would approve of this?
Text you cousin who lives at Ikea.
'Get a fixer-upper', you said. We're MICE, dammit.
It’s missing the cheese.
Really?  You bought the one that says, "Cheese not included"?
We should have bought the display model.
Before IKEA you just had to get through the maze to get the cheese.
If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times—don’t order anything that says “assembly required!”
Forget the schematics.  Let's build it so we win every time!
Isea, Ibea, Ikea!
The 'cheese', my friend, is in the doing of it...
Wouldn't you know it - the part they left out is the cheese.
Do you know how much lab mice make?! This training set up will more than pay for itself.
I really think that if she wants us to perform these tests she should build it herself
If I'm going to be running the rat race,I'd rather it be on my terms.
That IS what we're doing......thinking outside of the box!
Hey, who moved our cheese?
Cheese wedge not included.
We should have paid extra to have it assembled.
I know it’s a pain, but IKEA makes the BEST mazes!
It’s one of IKEA’s latest trappings
We're on our own. The instructions are in Chinese.
'It's all English to me'
Damn this instruction kit.  We are missing a screw!
I can't believe I do this all week in work, just to come home and have to do the same thing.....
So we've gotta build our own maze? Who ARE these jokers?
Their meatballs are great! Their instructions....not so much...
The reward at the end is what, again?
At IKEA, you solve a maze to buy a puzzle.
How much was the cost to have it assembled when you ordered this?
I wish you wouldn't bring your work home.
Next time we buy it installed.
It's the giant, easy-to-build, luxury maze from Ikea.
Does it count as cheating if we built it?
Let's leave this here and move down the hall.
What is the purpose of this piece of wall again?
Let's make it dead end to mess with the humans.
They taught me to talk, not to read.
What?! No cheese included?
It did say some assembly required when we ordered it.
Contractors are such rats.
The assembly service will not be carried out if the customer refuses to secure the piece of furniture where this is indicated in the product instructions.
...and you thought “Mousetrap” was fun.
Remember, easy enough for the house mice to win once in awhile, but hard enough that the lab mice don't run us out of cheese!
Ikea bro.
“I thought I'd never use my experimental psychology degree.”
You start and I'll catch up.
It's a test.  We're supposed to build our own maze.
Let's just move on to the next gallery.
Forget it. Let's just make a maze.
Once we get started there’s no turning back.
Do you know how to read?
The trick is knowing where to start.
The kids are gonna love this.
A lot of work for no reward, if you ask me!
They left out the cheese.
What do you mean you already ate the cheese?
Do you think this is part of the test?
This would be easier if we knew how to read.
It's a living!
Of course we can do it. It's not like we're trying to build a better mousetrap.
Why are we doing this again?
You know the instructions for pouring water out of a boot are written on the heel.
I keep telling you - the best way to predict the future is to invent it!
I smell a rat.
THIS is how we beat our best time.
Sure, but it will be OUR maze.
...IKEA is expanding into the DIY housing market..."
Build a better what?! I didn't send you to MIT for this!
Let's just eat the cheese now
We can't get there from here.
The assembled floor model seemed simpler in the store with the Rosti potato fritter between my paws.
So inspired, so devious and yet so simple.
I think that's too many parts to have left.
How dumb do they think we really are?
It's called Mäaz
Did you find the bag with opposable thumbs?
Who needs directions? Just put the cheese right inside the entry.
We have to make it look hard so they’ll think we’re smart.
This is the last maze I order from Ikea!
Why not just eat the cheese?
After we build the maze, we get to navigate through it and get some cheese.
Let’s build it so there’s a straight shot to the cheese.
These NIH budget cuts are are really beginning to bite!
Yeah, it says so right here, "cheese not included."
Look, even they can do it.
I say let’s scrap the stupid maze and just go get some cheese.
Wait, it says here cheese not included
Now that the research budget has been cut, we all have to pitch in a little more.
I give up, let's just eat the cheese.
It will be a maze, Ing
I think we’re missing the wheel parts.
Make it easy, they'll think we're smart. Make it hard, they'll think we're smart. Make it easy
Suppose we get lost?
This is why I prefer to work with non-Swedish designers.
Think outside the box. Construct inside the box!
Lucky for you, guys like me don’t need to read directions.
It's written in Squirrel
It says assembly is not available for online orders.
I'm telling you. It's better without the roof anyway.
Let's just go straight to the cheese.
Sure, I can build a better one.  But who wants them beating a path to my door?
No we shouldn't call the assembly service, last time they set it up it was a complete maze inside
After looking over the instructions, I think it will be easier if we just break up now.
Stop obsessing about the cheese!
Lets just call, ok?
This whole DIY movement has gone way too far!
Pavlov’s dog sent specific instructions for rats
They finally built a better mouse trap.
The NIH budget cuts are out of control.
Wait, we can't read.
Instead of cheese, let's put your cute sister at the end.
Does this come with an opposable thumb?
Do you ever get the feeling that somehow, the universe is testing us?
If we figure it out, it's going to be amazing!
It's not a trap. It's their new inclusion policy.
You just had to buy our maze from Ikea, didn't you?
No exit. Is it a trap?
listen, i can fix it. make it easier.
Why do you insist on doing these puzzles from IKEA?
'Just remember, I want a corner office,"
We should have just paid for the home assembly.
Darn it ! Another translation from Japanese.
Just pretend it's a maze.
It says there’s no cheese, just a Swedish meatball.
Make it difficult. I'm on a diet.
Let’s just eat it.
They said the cheese is knowing you did a good job.
Wait ... you say you smell a rat?
Whose bright idea was it to set it up ourselves?
No!  Do not build a better mousetrap.
No more IKEA mazes.
Let's build a secret passage to the reward space.
We can post this diagram on mousemaze.com so that everyone can get the cheese.
It says to put a line on the floor so we can find our way out.
I read all the directions and frankly I think we should stop here.  The plan  doesn’t seem to include an exit l
These instructions must have been translated by a freaking cat
Do you want to just get takeout?
Sorry, it says right here,'Cheese not included.'
Should be build the Trump version or the Obama version?
Can't you see we're digging our own graves here?
It says that the cheese is sold seperately.
I say let's think "back in the box."
I got it at IKEA,its a mantrap.
Dammit, the cheese is missing!
It says "scientific maze" but I think it's a trap.
Why don’t we put the cheese right by the door?
But my way is a straight shot at the cheese and we're done now.
I think we just made a better mousetrap.
These instructions are a maze to me
Can we never go to Ikea again?
Please, you are telling me . . . you ate the cheeze?
How will we get out.
Beats me. Do you read Swedish?
I told you these blue prints were for a bed, not a maze!
Bad news.  Cheese not included.
I consider myself an accomplished visual learner, but these are just Swedish hieroglyphics.
Why do we do this to ourselves when all we really want is a little cheese?
I called them about the missing bolt but they told me to get lost
We should bank our savings from IKEA for marriage counseling.
So who really wants a better mousetrap?
Sort of reminds me of Sartre.  No exit.
If we build it do you think that researchers will come?
There must be another way to get cheese.
"so when do we use the glue?"
Forget this, I've looked thru the box again and no sign of any cheese!
Trust me, we'll catch that cat
Do you want to call IKEA or should I?
And now I'm leaning toward the open plan, again.
No, it's just pictures.  See.
I don't know about you, but I'm having trouble finding the motivation.
I know I said it was all included but only the mouse trap came with cheese.
Let's cut the maze crap and go open concept this time.
Let's throw in a curve!
You'd think ALL parts included covered cheese.
What if all this is just a test?
I'm still not paying for assembly.
But if we build it, isn't that bad for us?
IT READS  SHOULD TAKE 45 MINUTES TO COMPLETE .  IS THAT WITH OR WITHOUT THUMBS???
But what if you're a mouse who likes to get lost?
Should we just hire someone off of TaskMouse?
This is the last time we buy furniture from Ikea that's been designed by Christopher Nolan.
Memorize this blueprint and we’ll be golden.
Some walls are missing in this set too! This house is going to look like another freaking maze.
Sorry, I'm a Norwegian rat, not Swedish. I don't do Ikea.
Damn Ikea !
In the pre-IKEA era, [underlined: building] the maze didn't use to be part of the experiment.
Thank you for coming to save the day, Mighty.
Plan B is we go free range, like the chickens.
What's a maze?
How to build a better mouse tr.....what the hell?
​I just worry that it won't go with the Rembrandt.
Seems like we’re one wall short of a cat trap!
The actual one will be human sized
Tell me again, how does this cure cancer?
What a poet said about mice and men explains this plan.
Spoiler alert. It's cheese.
I don't think it is exactly ethical for us to be building a better mousetrap.
Lets forget the whole maze idea altogether and instead build Ratatouille a new kitchen!
They forgot to include the cheese.
This is the real test of intelligence.
Just our luck.  The instructions are in Chinese.
My human thinks the ultimate variable ratio reward training is to have me build the maze without all of the necessary parts.
Step 2 and I'm already lost.
You know I don't read Swedish.
Rats! We're missing a screw.
The grant wasn't renewed. Its IKEA.
Damn humans!  They expect us to put this together without an Allen wrench?
I hope you know Swedish.
Some plan. It says right here, “Cheese NOT included!”
Something tells me we should look up “musfälla.”
They say success is its own reward. Guess they ran out of cheese.
It says here cheese must be purchased separately.
I K E A  must have funded this grant!
Where should we put the Safe Room?
Leave the maze, take the cheese.
If you don't stop chanting 'Build That Wall', I'm going to separate you from your testicles at the border.
This is worse than the swing set!
NIH cut the research grant so now we have to build it AND run it.
I bought it for the children
Are you sure you ordered the bookcase?
We’re missing the cheese.
If we have directions, what's the point?
Should we just get takeout?
It's supposed to be a-maz-ing!
I don't think we are ever getting out of here.
What do you mean you lost the receipt?
Screw deferred gratification. Let's just eat the cheese.
Screw the directions, I say we build a better mousetrap!
It says here," Once assembled may accidentally cause serious injury or death"."Cheese not included."
I was thinking that we should leave it at this and go open plan.
This is the last time I buy a maze kit from Ikea.
This administration doesn't believe in funding science.
Maybe the mice can do it better,but thanks to Ikea,we can do it faster!
If we follow the directions step-by-step, we shouldn't get lost.
Heh ! And here is where, on the full scale model, the electric shock goes.
No, the maze is not necessary; but it does make the cheese taste better.
Do you really know how to do it, or Google know?
Heck, I thought we'd get some cheese  with this trap.
So THIS is what the man in the white coat meant by “testing the construction of behavioral norms.”
See, it says right here, ""Det är enkelt, högerkramat, vänsterlöst."
Let's quit while we're ahead
Death is not the end.
No, Jeremy won’t be helping us. He helped with the better mouse trap.
What the..., the instructions are in Swedish!
Honestly, I think we’re better off just leaving it as is.
All of this for some Swedish meatballs?
I don't know, does it feel like Stockholm syndrome to you?
Mom gave it to me for Christmas!
If we do the maze correctly, it's the layout of the Ikea store.
They did a lousy job translating these instructions from gerbil.
Building it ourselves kinda defeats the purpose.
Let’s split up.
If Big Pharma doesn’t kill us, these directions will.
I told you we should have gone with the open concept maze!
These IKEA instructions are in Swedish. I say we hide all the parts and put the cheese just inside the door.
I think we can squeak by without the smoke alarms.
This happens every time we buy stufffrom IKEA.
This is asking a lot.
I think you do pronounce the "K" and the "J" is like a "Y".
All of this for a piece of cheese? You've gotta be kidding!  Let's just call Snack Hub.
These directions are aMAZing
When we're done it should look just like IKEA.
I'm just here for the cheese.
Darn IKEA image directions are written in Chinese.
How much extra will it cost to get someone to assemble it?
Now you won't have to ask for directions.
Forget this crap, let's go eat all the meatballs
Oh, honey, let's run and leave this Scandinavian hell behind forever
I hope we can figure this out. I'm getting hungry.
It's simple: the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
It’s a death trap, it’s a suicide rap .
Now put it back in the box and we'll time how long it takes them to realize a screw is missing.
Just get me when it’s time to argue about the backsplash.
We need Taskrodent
When we complete this there is $90,000 of debt and a job at Whole Foods at the end.
Honestly, these experiments just keep getting weirder.
They haven't even built it and we came.
Did I not say 'open concept' is just a fad?
I understand their floor plan labyrinth design but I prefer an open concept.
How'd we get stuck with the scientists from IKEA?
This way our kids will never leave the house.
I say we bell the cat and stay put.
Now that we know the plans, we can avoid another mouse trap.
It may not be Disneyland, but at least it will be all ours.
I mean it! If we unionize, we can put an end to this "other duties as assigned" crap!
I got it at IKEA. It'll be simple to put it together.
Hey,do you read IKEA?
First things first, did you bring the LSD?
But what did the dormouse say?
It says 'Minotaur not included.'
I think we're missing a Minotaur.
The irony is that once we've built it we'll have nothing left to prove.
See? I told you open floor plans were on the way out!
Don’t bother. ‘Cheese not included’.
Amazing!  What kind of dummies do they think we are?
So far so good but what is a door ? My folks never had a door.
It says if any parts are missing not to return it to the store but call this 1-800 number instead.
Sure we can put the maze together, but look it says cheeae not included.
If only we had opposable thumbs.
It's the IKEA maze kit"
It's amazing!  I thought we ordered maize, not maze.
You read the English instructions, 
I’ll read the French.
Let's build the easy maze.
IKEA funded the study.
I just hate these IKEA manuals ...
Now comes the hard part.
It's from Ikea, if we assembly it right the lab puts the cheese
What is an ektthorpe and just exactly how many hex wrenches does one mouse need?
I think they are trying to mess with us.
So, THIS is how you do it in Sweden?
I'm done with Ikea. The instructions are in Swedish.
Son, you can’t call Taskrabbit, you need to know the twists and turns of this project!
Hey, it was your idea to buy a flip.
The directions are in Korean again !
Build it and they will come my ass!... we need cheese.
Why on earth did you buy a maze from Ikea?
Insert cheese where?!
Ha! Remember when they  called this a "mouse hole"?
Have you considered GPS?
I think it’s Swedish for ‘experiment’.
It says here cheese not included.  What is this? Some sort of demented lab experiment?
It would help if I knew where the cheese will be.
If it were in French I'd be good, but Swedish?
We better bring these instructions with us if we want to have a prayer of getting out!
I was thinking eggshell white for the interior.
I'm still not sure how we'll use the allen wrench
We've got this - we don't need directions.
Where's the exit?
It's how to build a better mousetrap...I say we pass.
Yes, building it ourselves WILL skew the test results, but cheese is cheese.
They can't build a better mousetrap, so they want us to build a better maze?
Let’s return it, I prefer an open floor plan.
Some assembly required?  Easy to follow directions?  I
My guess is that our test lost its government grant.
Ugh, Ikea forgot two screws and the cheese.
There's no cheese.
All this for some stinky cheese.
I don't need directions. I watched YouTube.
We can always call Ikea as a last resort
Sure, we COULD just go get some cheese, but don't you think the process will be its own kind of reward?
I know it’s silly and a lot of work, but it makes them so happy!
Did you make sure that all of the parts were included?
There must be a trap somewhere
I guess it's the Ikea idea.
We'd better get moving on this. Her first Cheese-Of-The Month shipment arrived today!
It came with meatballs rather than cheese.
Do you know how to read Swedish?
We'll corner the market.
Ikea will never know what hit 'em!
If we just ditch the boards and the instructions, I wonder what that will tell them.
Do you want to read the instructions or just jump to the cheese?
How did we get stuck with this job?
I suspect we're in the control group.
Check the parts list. Where’s the cheese?
It says: "How to build a better people trap"
You mean we have to supply the cheese?
This is harder to figure out than Brexit.
You read 'em.  I'm more visual.
We aced all the mazes, building a better mousetrap will be even easier.
Here’s an idea: open floor plan.
The object here is not to be left with one screw.
It appears we're one board short of a full kit.
Why don't we just skip all these Ikea instructions and just eat the cheese?
If we build a better maze, the world won’t beat be a path to our door.
Did you get this from Ikea?
Once you get into it, it's easy
This is the last time we're buying anything from Ikea
It was on sale -- Mexico paid for the wall.
This is the start of a rat race, Tom.
Forget this, let's go get a beer.
Let’s slow down, this isn’t a rat race.
There’s no cheese. Definitely not a trap!
Nah - too obvious.
When I signed up for this job I didn't think they'd make me build the maze too.
It’s IKEA, let’s just use poison.
Do you understand these maze instructions? I'm lost.
"Yes, the 3D versions now come with instructions."
Uh, opposable thumbs and a wrench? No, I don’t, do you?
On second thought, I prefer the simple life
Experiments were much more fun before the genetic engineering.
I still think we should call a Task Rabbit.
Let's call IKEA right now!
Forget it, I'll just buy the cheese.
If we finish it, they'll give us a lingonberry.
We're mice. We're known for poor eyesight. This might be a trap.
We're lost!  There's no exit
I have to say, the staff cuts at this lab have really gotten out of hand.
Now when it's your turn, remember to make it look difficult.
Maybe we can change the angles on this a bit and allow for an open kitchen layout.
Let’s make it look really difficult and they’ll  publish some stupid report.
I'm sure it'll be very nice - I only wish we had a view of Central Park.
Personally, I prefer an open floor-plan.
Screw this. I've got some aged cheddar back at my place. Let's go get hammered...
I give up. You want to order cheese carryout?
Screw it. Let's just go with open concept.
And the voice said, "If  you build it, cheese will come."
Don't worry. The guy in the white coat swore this is how they make cheese.
I'd be more motivated if there was food at the end of this.
Or we could just go eat meatballs.
I don't see any cheese in the instructions
It converts to a bunk bed when they are old enough to find the exit.
Now that the shiplap has been taken down, our open concept design will mean a quick flip, and should make us stacks and stacks of cheddar.
As long as people can see us thinking outside the box, the execution is irrelevant.
Screw the maze idea.  If we go straight up, we'll be a towering success!
Who the hell is Paulo Freire?
They never ask what WE want. Let's go with an open office plan.
TopoKea
“Sometimes I feel like I’m my own worst enemy“
It needs a catdoor
Funny, I just got a craving for swedish meatballs.
They never should have awarded that government research project to IKEA.
"I think they're f **king with us."
Looks like the cheese is sold separately.
I think if we follow these instructions, we might be able to better trap ourselves.
I'll get the cheese while you finish the maze.
I could never understand why all the parts have Swedish names.
We'll be the big cheese if we can pull this off.
Where can you get a drink around here.
We may be the wrong choice to build a better mousetrap.
I know, I'm sorry, but their Swedish meatballs are so good.
My entry for MOMA.
Illustrations. Not a single God-damned written word!
Screw these budget cuts.  What happened to the Skinner Box?
I’m not going to include a bathroom in our new house since we piss and shit constantly.
Forget it; let’s build a maze!
Ikea built a better mouse trap! We'll be so busy building this thing we won't have time for cheese.
We're screwed, it's a trap!
I’m just tired of open floor plans.
Trust me, it 's cats' play.
Tell me again...why will they put the cheese in there?
There's sure to be an online video if we run into trouble.
It's in Swedish...I can't read it.
It was a good plan Jerry but it says it right here, cheese not included.
Gracie. It's going to be amazing!
The satisfaction of putting it together yourself makes you to forget that the economy has left you with no other path.
Fuck it.  Let's go out to eat
Why so complicated, can’t we just get a cheeseboard?
I don't need the instructions.  How many different ways to put it together can there be?
This new game a mazes me!
It's an experiment.
Reward?  I’m guessing Swedish meatballs, just like the human one.
I know. I’m just hoping the ‘budget’ they keep cutting is a type of cheese.
It says here we are supposed to build a cognitive map of IKEA
It's worker abuse. First we gotta build it and then how to get out of it. Only a rat's brain could figure this out.
Whoever wrote these instructions has a few shrews loose.
It's a map of the store.
Forget it. We'll squat next door.
I'd rather get lost in Yonkers.
I love the trap door idea - so Wicked.
I wonder what ‘Måz’ even means in Swedish?
Forget the maze; let's put up condos.
I don’t understand, I thought the humans were supposed to build this.
Screw it. Let's hit the open road!
So where's the Västerbottensost.?
You know, we could just build a regular apartment instead.
Is this someone's Ikea of a cruel joke?
Remember don't leave too fast, they'll get upset and might dissect you to see how you did it.
Maybe IKEA wasn’t the best choice
We're never buying another thing from IKEA.
The hours are long, but they have cheese at the cocktail parties.
They must think we don't know what cheese smells like?
Building this maze is going to take longer than it did for us to find the exit to the store.
Don’t worry about it.  I wintered last year in an IKEA.
Still qualifies for rent control.
I think our kit is missing the cheese! So, really, what's the point?
If we figure this out, I'll be amazed.
It says here the cheese is sold separately.
Gnawsome!
It said it came with cheese! I don't see any cheese!
If I hear "open concept" one more time....
Whadda’ya think? Maze or 2-bedroom condo?
I told you if we ordered Amazon Prime the Drone would have delivered it fully assemble in a Maze
Why don't we just put the cheese outside the box?
Digging our own graves would be more noble than this.
So...cheese break?
We must build that which will destroy us.
It doesn’t make sense to me either but I hear there’s cheese at the end, so...
We don't have opposable thumbs!  What were you thinking?!
Female mice would ask for directions.
The cheese is sold separately.
I can't read Swedish; can you?
Have you seen the block of cheese?
It’s about time they gave up on that ‘better mousetrap’ chimera.
You had to get it at Isqueaka, didn't you?
But we don't have a Phillip's head.  The cat got Phil last week.
Used to be that all we had to do to get the cheese is run through it.  These NIH cutbacks are hurting all of us.
And you said the running wheel would be a waste of our time...
They’re trained to give us cheese when we finish the maze.
I am glad we are thinking outside the box to figure out this
I'm completely lost at the moment.
How 'bout you build the maze, and I'll plant the corn?
Okay, that's the last time we shop at IKEA.
It says it's a test of our relationship.
No I don't speak Swedish....do you?
Believe me: I don’t see how this lab-test could lead to any breakthrough in couple relationships with such a clumsy and incompetent partner like you.
I am concerned about the cat door location.
It's directions for how to build a better mousetrap.
I wasn’t feeling challenged enough at work.
To beat it first you gotta know how they’re made.
Building a better mousetrap isn’t so easy after all.
Does Google translate from rat to mouse?
"It wouldn't be called sweat equity if it was easy to assemble."
Maze? These directions are a fucking maze!
When we go full scale, first we'll send in the grad students.
How hard can it be? They always include an allan key!
Whose idea was it to run a DIY maze?
I feel like these experiments are getting pretty ridiculous.
They will put more cheese out if you pretend you can not smell it.  The best cheese goes to the slowest mice.
Let's forget this, and go straight for the cheese.
Why are the directions just pictures of different cats?
I'd rather gnaw through a fire hydrant than put this thing together.
So I guess now’s not the best time to tell you I slept with your wife?
I told you we should've gotten the BJÖRKSNÄS instead.
This is one crazy looking bookcase. What’d IKEA name this one?
The cat said this would turn out to be amazing!
Looks like this maze is modeled after the new 1040 form.
Can you believe it? They've sent us the wrong screws again!
The hazard of this project would be how to get out.
Cheese not included? I hate Ikea.
Better for whom?
The cheese tastes better this way. I promise.
Musfälla?
... these Ikea instructions always have
the strangest sounding words.

(mouse trap)
In Swedish, it's pronounced Eke-a
Why don't we just put the cheese at the entrance and end this charade?
Course design is where the big cheese is.
Are you certain you clicked the option to include the cheese?"
Let's dumb it down
What part of 'Don't get it from Ikea'  isn't clear?
IKEA  sent it. Apparently we’re now beta test rats.
Last time we buy anything at IKEA!
If we make it difficult, it means more cheese for us.
Rats! We forgot the cheese.
It's hard to put into words.
Now remember where we leave the cheese!
They provided the hex wrench, but do we have a screwdriver?
IKEA got it!
Let’s just run it as is, okay?
It's supposed to be a 1 floor Victorian but last time I tried it turned into a maze.
Ok, I'll marry you if we can assemble this IKEA maze without bloodshed.
You're really sure that if we build it, cheese will come?
I said no  IKEA. But no, you had to have a Swedish maze!
Let's create a new rat race?
Remember, discipline equals freedom.
We can blame IKEA for starting a pet product line.
Unfortunately, the cheese is not included.
L thought you said this maze from mIceKEA would be so simple to put together, that even a human could do it!
Maybe we should just go with an open concept.
Listen, Ted, I have no interest in carpentry either, that's kinda why I'm in finance. But you heard the lab tech, "no maze, no cheese"... so will you please make like Algernon and find me Panel A and the 3/4-inch screws?
I really think this will be more motivating than that hamster wheel in the basement.
The faster we do it, the faster we're outta there.
It clearly says, 'cheese not included.'
I can't read it. It's in Swedish.
But I don't like cheese.
Maybe we'll find Swedish Meatballs at the end.
Just our bad luck to end up at the IKEA research lab....
It looks like they forgot to include the Västerbotten.
If we screw this up, there’s no way out
It says we get the cheese when we finish the maze.
I have no clue what I'm doing.
They are very thorough. 
They even included a block of cheese.
It was very tasty.
I think Ikea put the wrong directions in the box.
Not exactly what I had in mind when you said a bonding experience.
Well, I say it's a maze, and I say the hell with it.
To be honest, I'd rather just find my way out of an IKEA.
Let's think out of the box.
These Ikea flatboxes look simple but really its a two-mouse project.
Does the institutional review board know we're being forced to construct our own maze?
We are building a people trap that I got at IKEA
You know, when we are done with this they are going to make us find our cheese.
No, I told you twice already, the cheese goes in last.
The fine print says cheese not included!
What the hell is a "carnubenflugen"?
We got the Cheese not included version?
This doesn’t look as easy as the guy at Ikea said would be!
Let’s do the kitchen first.
It's called a Swedish maze.
How about a sunroom for a change?
I've had it - Let's go eat some cheese!
Maybe this is what they mean when they talk about building a better mouse trap.
Apparently, cheese is not included...
They expect us to BUILD this thing, too?
You read?
Why are we building this again?
In architecture school they said there should be back door.
Why do you always try to make your life more difficult?
Just what do you mean by "read the directions first?"
​
Funding for this research project has been provided by IKEA International.
They recommend an Ikea showroom layout.
Forget the maze. I can’t figure out the instructions.
Working for this company has been nothing but a rat race. They work us 24/7, the work space is nothing but a maze and they only feed us cheese that it has holes in it."
What do you think about an open floor plan
Wasn’t there supposed to be a big hunk of cheese with this?
It's a maze to test our intelligence. If we keep these plans, it'll be easy to negotiate.
You're the one on adderall ! "
All this work for a lousy piece of cheese?
Don't worry, Harold. If we can't successfully assemble this, we can just run for office.
It's bring Your Victim to Work Week.
I think it's the lingonberry sauce that brings their Swedish meatballs to life.
Freakin IKEA!
What say we just build a better mouse trap.
Any chance a ‘No Cats Allowed’ sign would be sufficient?
This would be so much easier if I could read Swedish.
Life was easier before they cut the research budget.
I'm in the IKEA study.
I told you to read the box! The block of cheese is sold separately!
It will be easier if we just watch the video on tube.
Ikea said it was easy
I just hate Ikea.
Ikea?  I thought this was an animal cruelty free lab.
I'm amazed  by its simplicity
I have an idea. Let's skip the maze and go straight for the cheese.
Oh, I can build it all right.  The trick is getting back out.
When stuff starts arriving from Ikea, it's pretty clear the lab is suffering budget-cuts.
Finally, we get to make the rules!
'Cheese not included' ? WTF?!
I don't think the cheese is included.
I thought it would include the cheese.
IKEA have the most endearing names for their furniture. 'Mousetrap'. How quaint!
Seems like a hell of a lot of work for a piece of cheese.
Didn't we do this one a couple of weeks ago?
That’s the beauty of IKEA...there’s always a hack.
What do you wanna bet there's still only one piece of cheese at the end?
Screw this. Let’s wing it.
On second thought, let's have the meatballs before we start, so we're not hungry and cranky halfway through.
Let’s build it so we head straight for the cheese!
Thank goodness we're in the group that was given the instructions. NOT!
For the last time, no, we are not getting drunk before doing this.
The ad implied it came with cheese.
We'll put a "back door"  here, in case we get lost.
That's what we get from the researchers' shopping at Ikea.
This is Mickey Mouse compared to that bookshelf.
According to this we're missing some bolts, as well as the cheese.
Trump really cut the science budget.
If we start building from the inside, we'll never make it out.
It was supposed to come with cheese.
Let’s think outside the box and not build this ...
If we make the walls all parallel, we can run straight through in record time.
Why exactly are we trying to build a better mousetrap?
Are they kidding?  This is the better mousetrap?
If we build it, doughnuts will come.
If we can't figure it out now how will we figure it out later?
Why does this feel like a trap?
When it's built they will want us to find our way out!
We can go back to the open design plan.
Have you looked at these Mickey Mouse blue prints?
This always happens when you buy from IKEA.
Just accept it. If it's from China there will be missing parts.
Call me crazy, but I want this to be a metaphor for human life.
It's amazing that they let us set it up ourselves!
Of course it’s big enough! What should we put at the end to motivate the giants?”
Cheese is not included?
You know how I feel about walls.
Maybe it was meant just for rats.
Let's ask the cat for help.
Don't think of it as a budget cut, Carl. Think of it as an opportunity!
I thought you said we were going to build a better mousetrap.
It's a plan for building a better cat trap!
These Ikea mazes are always more difficult to assemble than you think.
Did they not say "cheese included"?
It’s an Ikea maze.
And you said ... Build a better mousetrap.
Sometimes it feels like Ikea is experimenting on us.
how Do we know this isn’t a better mousetrap
Go ahead, amaze me!
We can change the whole equation by building a labyrinth so everyone can get in and out and leave them with no data.
This is how we’ll get our steps in.
We’ll  make it look even tougher. After all,  those humans certainly love a good rat race, don’t they .....?
It says so right on the box: "Cheese not included."
I'm sensing some irony here.
Everything is here except for the cheese.
These home meal kits are complicated.
And in the center we place a copy of "Who Moved My Cheese?".
Where does the cheese go?
I’m waiting for Pavlov to finally ring the bell
Honestly, I'd be fine with an open-concept maze.
No no. We're supposed to find the cheese, not eat it.
häpnadsväckande
a-mazing
Humoring Dr. Pavlov gets more tedious with each passing academic year
It's a trap, but not a better trap.
I hate it when you shop at Ikea!
It came with everything but the cheese.
SEE, no inclusion, no exclusion!
Don’t worry.  There’s always a screw missing.
I can't believe I let you talk me into getting a maze at Ikea.
Consider this a promotion.
This is the last time we buy a maze at Ikea
The voice said – if you build it, cheese will come.
Yes we’re exhausted. But think how much faster we’ll find our food!
Hmm, I think we may have been duped. There is no cheese on this parts list.
Crud,they didn't pack the cheese.
Hey the piece of cheese is missing, have you seen it?
I knew it! Cheese isn't included.
I have a cousin in Stockholm, we could ask him what an "urbster' is.
If this is Ikea's version of building a better mouse trap, then we have nothing to worry about!
To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson...
Only 39% of the humans have been able to complete the maze.
I say we start from the middle and build our way out.
We're lucky IKEA tells it all in pictures.
It is even easier to get lost now.
Frankly, I prefer an open floor plan.
Just eleven more steps and we'll have our own IKEA.
Das Rathaus ist dumm.
Want to break for some Swedish cheese?
Who moved my cheese?
I know it said "some assembly required" but cheesus christ this is insane!
Should we do an open-office concept this time?
I am so done with Ikea.
Why is the cheese always sold separately?
"I prefer an open floor plan.
This is the last time we're shopping at Ikea.
You were a Boy Scout.I was a math major. We can do this !
Why do they always leave out some small, but crucial, piece of hardware?
IKEA says nobody stirring can follow these instructions..not even a mouse.

Suzi Rines Duxbury MA
We can build a better mousetrap.
I wish the directions for this IKEA maze had some words.
Yes.  And we have to make our own cheese when we’re finished.
It'll pretty much look like an IKEA when finished.
Does this one have a happy ending?
Ok eddy, we’ve gone through the entire box...........where’s the cheese?
I couldn't resist.  Ikea had it on sale.
Let me show you how to do it son. Just let go of the instructions, watch me, and don't say a word
In the short term, it limits our carbon foot print. In the long term, it could kill the cat and save our world.
And I thought the maze was difficult!
This instruction manual is more complicated than most mazes!
After they find the cheese no mouse is going to care that we deviated from standard maze theory.
Did you know the cheese wasn't included when you ordered it?
All this to build a better mouse trap?
This is the easy part. The confusion comes later.
Let’s build a maze with no way out and put the lab humans in their to study their levels of frustration.
Seriously, Gary: why do we keep doing this to ourselves?
I don't see where we're supposed to put the cheese.
You’ve watched the Italian Job too many times!
You have to start thinking outside the box.
Let’s just break-up - it’s quicker.
Talk about inventing a new mousetrap.
Did the instructions come with cheese or do we have to purchase that ourselves?
I hate when the directions only have pictures.
I know you want to build a complicated maze- just make sure we leave room for the hot cheese fountain.
I never did like  IKEA ,Martha .
I hear they’re replacing the cheese with meatballs, too.
A maze? Not the way we're gonna build it.
Swedish diagrams don't translate to Mouse...
So you’re sure this Better Mousetrap comes with unlimited cheese?
I've always wanted to build my own bureaucracy.
There's no cheese at the end, but there are instructions for assembling a dairy processing plant.
I'm beginning to wonder if we actually need to build a maze in the first place.
The voice said, 'If you build it, they will come...and supply the cheese.'
Shhh. They call it a cubicle.
You always said you wanted to build a better mouse trap.
If this is what you want we can build it.  But don't expect to hear from Architectural Digest.
Wow! The IKEA maze! And no words - even we can do it!
I already ate the cheese but what else did you have planned for this weekend?
Damn. They always leave out a part!
This is the IKEA version.
Is this the first time you worked the Ikea maze?
I hear there are some great meatballs at the end.
I don't get it. If they forgot the cheese, what's the point
OK, now remember, each time you get to a maze out board, tighten the screws so the drive is in the north/south position. All the others should be east/west.
Thank goodness the instructions are in braille.
How much does it cost to engage a Task Tabbit to finish it?
I can't wait to see how they deal with an open floor plan.
Why should we build it?
Damn....Appears that the better mousetrap has been invented....
Please stop saying 'It'll be amazing.'
It's definitely a better trap.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
We got the short straw with this construction gig.  The others got to go do cancer research!
Seems we're missing one zinc-plated forged wing nut
Honestly I prefer the open floor plan.
Forget these blueprints...I envision an open-sided veranda, a firepit and four Adirondack chairs
Why do they always send extra parts?
It's from a Mr. Tolman in Ikea's Psychology Department
Guess we're the 9-in-10 mice that can't.
Don't worry about it, it's just a standard psych test.
Look whose testing animals now!
At least I didn't try and assemble it OUTSIDE the box...
You make your own mousetrap, then lie in it
I think Sartre wrote the directions
I’m just not motivated without the cheese.
If we do this right, there will always be food at the end!
The instructions are all in Swedish!
Damn!  It doesn’t come with cheese.
Wait, what’s the point of us putting the maze together?  There’s nothing in these instructions about cheese.
I say we skip the directions and go with a shotgun house floor plan.
And then cheese appears!
No wine while assembling this time... remember it’s from Ikea!
. . . explaining the instructions for an IKEA diy mouse maze to a skeptical apprentice,  "connect Part A to Part B by twisting screw D into hole 6A on the left and tightening it to 6B on the right side of Part B with allen wrench C . . . .
I can’t believe the cheese wasn’t included.
I told you not to order from Ikea.
How do you think they pronounce “Mäz”?
Let's build it our way. Mess with their heads.
You got this from Ikea, didn't you?
If you can’t figure it out from the pictures, I don’t think the English translation would help much.
Yeah, we can do it but we'll be too tired to run!
Keep this map, it may come in handy during the lab test!
I am so sick of mazes.  Can't they design something better?
It's an AP course.
I never cared for those old behaviorist models.
Let's go out for some cheese, then come back to this on a full stomach.
Stick with me here. There's Cheeeeze at the end.
Let's not make this difficult.
If humans can figure out these  IKEA instructions this should be really easy for us!
Sometimes the drilling brings the humans out from the walls.
I know what the directions say, but I  prefer open-concept
I would like the kitchen and master bedroom to be a little bigger.
When we've put it together, it will be amazing.
I'm tired of getting things from Ikea.
Bad news. They laid off the guy who buys the cheese, too.
If only the instructions came in English.
Can we just skip this and eat all the cheese?
Leave it to those Swedes, and didn't you love the waffles?
What does "allegory" mean?
Don't know about you but I'm lost.
Idiots. They left out the cheese.
It says 1x cheese piece.
Sure, it's the best maze kit on the market, but I just realized, they make mouse traps too.
'We could get lost in this thing'
Tell me again how this is going to be a rocketship.
You know what's missing?  Where's the cheese?!
Do you speak any of these languages?
If we can follow these IKEA instructions, it proves we’re smarter than the humans.
You need instructions? I can put this baby together from memory.
Why doesn’t this restaurant have any furniture or even cheese?
Don't forget to leave a small hole at the bottom.
'Cheese not included.' What, are you kidding me?
Let's have an open floor plan instead.
Let get the rats to do it.
Why are we building this? Let’s just eat the cheese.
It says "You must be under 2 inches tall to play."
Here it says we can tweak this manual to catch a cat
Careful, it looks like a trap.
It doesn't look like much now, but trust me, this will be a great place to raise a family.
We shouldn‘t build the labyrinth so complicated. Our doc has to understand it.
These instructions are pure claptrap
Should we just hire a Task Rabbit?
Wait a minute!  Why would we WANT to build a better mousetrap?
I miss the old days when you just have to find the cheese
I'd rather get shocked!
Passa på insexnyckeln, tack.
I told you to order it assembled!
It’s kinda like our last science project, but without the snacks.
You know we are working for cheese .
I told you never to buy from Ikea!
At the end of the day, it’s all about who you would want to get trapped with
Oh Man! It’s All in Chinese!
‘I look at it like we’re building memories together.”
Geeze, my last lab provided white glove service.
And at the end we'll put a wedge of sharp cheddar with a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon.
These instructions look amazing"
The good part is we no longer need to deal with undergraduates, the bad part is that we will get no credit
What say next Christmas we just buy Molly an Etch A Sketch?
Let's look at it this way; we get $9.50 an hour for running through the maze or $11.25 an hour for assembling one.  What sounds best to you?
Great! The instructions are in human.
Now they want us to build it???
And I told them my background was in the liberal arts library!
I am having a hard time believing this is how Disneyland got started.
I'm afraid to call a Task Rabbit.
According to this, we are sure to be amazed by the results
No mouse should be doing this...
Ikea you not, this will be amazing!
Clearly, it's a Mickey Mouse situation.
This feels like a good stoping point for today
Did we say 197 or 198 kids?
I guess we will be the masters of our own confusion.
I’m amazing with these things.
So, why are we doing this?
Ok now we just need her ex for bait
Can you feel it? We're liberating space for all of our clichés.
Have we considered an open layout?
At least we have the wrench!
I didn’t do so hot on my college boards, but we should be able to figure this out.
I was never good at mazes. Let’s just return this to Ikea and go open concept.
'The Bridge on the River Kwai?'....never heard of it. Why?
If we can figure this out, I'll be a-maze-d!
Let's put in walls, then desks and see if they can remember to find their way out.
You were the one that said we will save money on this Mouse Trap and it's easy to put together.
A little tip--When we're done building the maze, just play dumb!
Let's just wait till winter ... flood it and learn how to skate!
This is a hell of a trap.
We’ll  have the best run times ever if we throw out these IKEA  specs and design it ourselves!
You know the real test is if our relationship can survive assembling this maze from Ikea.
We could have bought it built, but no, you had to go to Ikea.
You must have bought the wrong kit. There's nothing in the instructions about installing a reward dispenser.
This is exactly what Post-Docs are for.
Trust me, George. We'll get out cheese as soon as we figure this out.
We can hide the gun behind an old-fashioned toilet.....
There's got to be an easier way to cut down on our cheese consumption.
And we'll be dead before they can foreclose.
They’ve forgotten the cheese!
It's completely philosophical, cheese-wise.
It's the plan for a better mouse maze.
What? It doesn't come with cheese?!
If we can't get this maze built we're never going to find the cheese.
I thought you said this was the kit that came with cheese!
I told you we should have paid extra for the assembly!
We were going to use that cheese to pay the contractor.
I get wanting a challenge, but no one ever chooses a maze.
If you give a mouse a hex key...
So much for “outside the box thinking provides mutually beneficial synergies”
Let's build a better mousetrap.
Oh darn, the instructions are in ratish.
Budget cuts!  They want us to construct the mazes to reduce research costs. I say we should strike.
Wasn't this supposed to come with Swedish meatballs for the reward?
Would it be a faux pas to put Swiss cheese in a maze made from a Swedish company's kit?
No.  I said  IDEA.
These instructions are in Swedish!
Ikea doesn't make Parcheesi, and you wanted something from Ikea!
All these stall panels but a single scrap to crap on.
You still have the box, right? The cat agreed to our offer.
But, is it big enough for cats?
This will take a few hours. Then we can eat.
We're missing the cheese Algernon!  Where's the cheese?
Once we build out own maze, we don't have to be test subjects anymore
Swedish lab rats
This is the last time that we shop at I-Cheese-A
We are going to be scurrying around all night on this one.
The boss wants us to "build a better mouse trap."
Rube Goldberg it’s not.”
Should we put some tape on it?
These IKEA mazes always stump me. Let's go see the Lab Bunnies and find Task Rabbit.
Thr open concept is so last season.
I can't read Swedish either.
These Swedish scientists are real sadists.
But why do we even WANT to build a model IKEA ?
It's called a keto gym. You run around and eat high fat food.
Only build  enough to get the cheese ,no more,OK !
It's all Swedish to me.
I wouldn’t risk it. Cheese is 0 days old.
Ikea directions are a maze!
Amäzing.
I thought you said it didn't have a cat flap
I think "House of Mouse" is copyrighted, though.
No, you don't seem to get it. This is really amazing!
Wow! Ikea want us to make our own cheese too?
We should of just failed that maze test
What a Rip-off!  The maze assembly instructions say "Winner's treat not included!"
Apparently, whoever wrote these instructions didn't speak Squeak.
Directions? We don't need no stinking directions.
If we build it, do you really think they'll come?
You can’t do that! That would cheating!
Tough call -- a maze, cubicles or hockey rink?
The cheese comes separately.
What the fuck is a Börfen?
IKEA , where do you think?
Ee- Kay- Uh?
It'll be amazeing when it's finished.
Maybe we should just go with an open floor plan.
I suddenly have a craving for Swedish meatballs...
How to make amaze
Even if we can’t do it, I loved the meatballs.
Bob Follek
"I told you getting the grant would be the easy part."
It's a trick test, IKEA doesn't sell cheese.
It all seems pointless, now that Mortimer ate the cheese.
If you build it they will come?" Ha! Last time they came all right -- BIG RATS
Where is the cheese cube? There's gotta be a cheese cube!
Where's PETA when you need them?
Uh-oh. 'Musfalla' is Swedish for mousetrap.
Where should we hide the cheese to find later?
Spoiler alert.
Wait-What’s this supposed to be again?
It says exactly what I told you when you ordered it, Morty. Cheese not included.
This will be a waste of time if it's already Google mapped.
No cheese- what's my motivation?
The good news is--once we build it, we'll definitely know how to get through it.
We're supposed to memorize the instructions.
I’m imagining a more minimalist approach.
Did you hear the joke about the human with free will?
You can buy a lot of cheddar for what they charged for assembly.
Let's save the directions in case we get hungry.
Have you considered an open concept?
It’s not my fault that we were born in IKEA !!!
Isn't there supposed to be a chunk of cheese included with this model?
I hope no one is watching.
I think you need an opposable thumb.
I figure 30 seconds, you?
You've done it once, you've done it a thousand times.
No, I said it would be fun to go to IKEA, not build an IKEA.
AMAZING, I MAY NEVER LEAVE IT!
What if we can’t figure our way out!
We'll  put Swedish meatballs and ice cream at the end.
There aren't any words, just pictures, and I'm not seeing any cheese on here.
I've got it - just put the cheese up front!
I really don't care how you build it. Just make sure it looks real cheesy.
Instructions indicate one mouse unhappy
Ikea's toy section is  A-Mazing!!
Wait...did you eat the cheese already?!
I got it from those Scandinavian mice.
I have just two words for you: Why Ikea?
Mice arguing over Ikea instructions.
"The faster we build it, the faster we find the cheese."
IKEA  says if we build it, the cheese will come.
I knew there’d be retribution when we beat that last maze!
Remind me again, why are we building this mouse trap
I rue the day we infested this Ikea.
If we can't, then who can?
Let’s build a vacation home instead!
I think we should just call the whole thing off.
Where do you want to put the trap door?
Did you order the cheese?
Always a piece missing—cheese!
The end is a snap.
Yes, and then we'll know how to run it!
Yes I'm happy. It's just, things were simpler in the old cage.
Should have ordered it from mousekia .
We're already in too deep and if we build it we'll never get out.
Why did they have to buy the maze at Ikea?
We can’t correct their mistakes - it’s the only way they’ll learn.
This is where we got stuck last time.
humans do this for fun?
I've seen humans construct this type of trap before.
IKEA corporate said we should make it as complicated as possible.
There's got to be a better way to get some cheese than building a better mouse trap.
Now we just need two glasses of pinot noir.
These research funding cutbacks are impacting all of us.
Let's shake it up. It was too easy for the last psychologist.
Maybe we should have put the walls up last.
Oh, I get it. It’s some kind of “test your knowledge” nonsense
We are never getting anything from IKEA again.
I don’t mind running it, but why do we have to build it ourselves!
Even if Plan B does work, will we ever find the way out?
I think it offers more of an intrinsic reward.
I favor an open plan. The last thing I want is to have to walk through a maze just to get a bit of cheese.
Trust me. If we build it, they will come.
The researchers are having us do it, because they can’t do it by pictures only.
They want US to build the maze?
The idea is that we make cubicles and observe which humans never find their way out.
Because the cheese will taste so much better.
It’s just a series of hallways.
We’re amazing.
just like a mouse, I forgot the screwdriver
Told you would should have just got some cheese and forget IKEA!
Five bucks says this confusing nonsense was written by a cat person.
What we lose in humiliation, we gain in satisfaction.
When we finish, do NOT lose the instructions !
It’s the newest IKEA model, this will be so much fun!!
We can be both architect and inmate of our own prison!
Just when I thought I'd escaped the rat race.
I think the scientists went to IKEA...
Did you see the cheese in the box?
Trust me,no foreigner is ever going to take this job.
We barely found our way out of the store.
I know IKEA  when I see IKEA.
This is testing my patience.
And you're testing my patience!
What's the point if you already ate the cheese?
Remember...it's right, left, left, right, left, right...food!
It's telling me the cheese is sold separately.
The kit is missing the cheese cube
I thought you said you grew up in IKEA.
I hate working for Swedish psychologists.
Christina on the Coast says subway tile in a harlequin pattern spells contemporary.
So I guess they're buying the mazes from IKEA now.
When IKEA hired us to design their new store, I guess I should bave expected to assemble it too.
I don't need this, I know what I'm doing.
Mighty Mouse has nothing on you my friend!
Ikea thinks they can build a better mousetrap.
Let's prove them wrong.
Let's show them we Can build a better mouse trap.
Of course it’s not from IKEA, I want us to still be friends after we do this.
When they send the Minotaur on us, just remember cheese is not a good substitute for wax.
Wouldn't you know it: Ikea left out the cheese.
The instructions didn't specify that opposable thumbs were necessary for assembly!
Yeah, I know, but it could be fun, anyway.
This seems to be a lot of work for a lousy piece of cheese.
``After we trap the fat bastard, what do we do with the body?''
Should we call a Task Rat?
Why can't they just be happy they taught us to read?
Why bother? The directions didn't come with any cheese.
I say we eat it.
Lose the directions. We'd only need them if we got lost.
You do speak Swedish, right?
It's  really a  no-brainer
Well, now all that we need are hands...
Tell me again. Why are we doing this?
Okay, but the challenge is to build it so we can find the cheese and no one else can.
Hold on! I just remembered. Walls don't work!
Let's start with what they think they're proving, then build a maze that will amaze them at how wrong they are.
Damn you Ikea!
%!*&$!, just let me read them first!
I don’t know whodunnit, Agatha!
It's the top-selling existential game -- Stumbling Through The Labyrinth of Life!
We’re building a better mousetrap, why?
Don’t we put the cheese in first and work backward?
We should just let the cat eat us instead
Why are you reading the directions?
You had to go to Ikea, didn’t you?
I’m amazed that we can’t find our way through these instructions.
How do you feel about an open floor plan instead.
Ugh! And you said: we should try building our own maze this time!
Running the maze to get the cheese is one thing, but this is really a step too far.
A treadmill for mice.
Honey, I got this amazing deal from IKEA.
It’s a new maze I picked up at IKEA!
First, we should agree on the meaning of "Better."
Well, you better hurry. We only have three hours until the kids wake up.
It’s a 2020 Election starter kit
So what's the payoff?
What reward?!
We should have hired TaskRabbit!
But if we build it, THEY will come.
Scientists are fascinated by these things.
Due to the recent restructure, our job description now includes  building our own maze
I told you not to overachieve. Now we have to build the damn thing.
You'd think the folks at IKEA would've realized we're Norwegian.
Trust me.  This is a good stopping point.
"Forget it.  I thought step #26 would be 'Now eat the cheese'."
Know what I think would be really funny...shredding all the instructions that came in the inbox before the late mice get here.
You’re not supposed to read the instructions.
This will be amazing, Grace, a spiritual journey.
What are we doing here? We were born to scurry!
For the life of me I just don’t see the point
Something tells me this is more about testing stress than our ability to complete a maze.
I dunno know what it says, but the lab technician looked inconsolable.
Instead of building this stupid maze how about we just go to the fridge for cheese?
I hate when they write the instructions in pig latin.
If we build this “they will come”!
They forgot to send the cheese.
Let's just go with minimalist style and leave it as is.
Tell me again why we're building a house... we're pack rats.
Isn’t putting this together this enough?
I knew we shouldn't have gone to IKEA!
Just go Google Help
No, no, no, we aren't ready to select curtains.
Ever since we got that new Swedish lab assistant.
Let’s start at the end opposite the door to insure we can get out.
This open concept floor plan is amazing.
You'd think they would have already assembled the mouse trap."
They forgot to include the cheese. Have you got the customer service number?
The scientists are Swedish
I've heard it's amazing!
MY RESEARCHER IS SWEDISH.
Now they are really testing our intelligence!
You're the butch one. You figure it out."
I say that for once, we should let the guys in the lab coats deal with it
For a human trap, we will use beer instead of cheese
Can you read human?
It looked pretty simple when I saw it in Ikea.
IKEA, and yes it is amazing.
We've got to memorize this.
Did you check Mapquest?
Think ahead, I am sure this door's gonna stop the fat cat.
It says here that if we finish the maze we'll find the cheese.
I’m calling taskrabbit
What is the Swedish word for ' #*@*# ! ' ?
We've found the keys to the kingdom. They'll be amazed how fast we blow through this one!
I was only in it for the meätballs.
You can read? That’s amazing!
All that work to build a maze, I’m going uptown to live in a nice condo!
Even if we can build it, will they come?
Stupid humans.
Why don’t we just send it back?
I told you that 'Made in China' should have been a clue about the reliability of the instructions.
You still don’t get it? OK, let’s run through this one more time.
Aw rats! …. The instructions are all in Chinese.
What do you mean you don’t know how to read in IKEA?
Ever played Mouse Trap?
‘’If we make it too easy, we won’t get a reward.”
I double checked the pieces and I still can't find the cheese.
With the cutbacks we all have to do our part.
They hire us because they know, we know, what works and what doesn’t.”
These science funding cuts are just getting ridiculous.
Hey, these instructions aren't in mouse!
Why didn't you read the fine print? No cheddar included.
Would it kill you to give me my open concept living space?
Maybe we should just go with an open floor plan look.
Step 1. Something there is that doesn’t love a wall.  Repeat.”
Wish Tom was here
Insert Tab A into Slot B.
It says, Cheese Cubes 10 X.
Roam wasn’t built in a day.
We good?

We’re good!
I know we got this from Sears, but next time let's order from Ikea
Nah, the door needs to be on the other side
These experiments aren’t what they used to be.
The cheese is missing!
Maze shmaze
I can’t read these - I’m a millennial.
Before we start on the room, I think we should find a house.
What do you mean, you drank the screwdriver?
It's nice that they appreciate our brains, but they've got to throw in some cheese for motivation.  I quit.
Are you sure you want to build a better mousetrap?
I am sure there is an IKEA joke in here somewhere, if only the instructions were clearer.
It’s written right there, dearheart, “Cheese Sold Separately.”
How good are you at following directions translated by A.I.?
There's ever a human around when you need one
My wife wants a colonial but the kit's for a ranch."
We need a Phillips screwdriver, ​not an Allen wrench!
I’m not against animal testing if I run the company.
Remember when we built the crib?  What a disaster.
How are you with directions?
Baffled or amazed?
Hey Wally, look, plans for a rat maze.  It's a game.  Grandpa told me about these, be careful Randy he said, but then that was the last time I saw him
I think I left my wallet at IKEA.
Putting it together is easy. Taking it apart is why I get the cheddar.
This will be a great way to get away from the wife for awhile.
Can't we order the paper maze without getting all those extra parts?
All I really needed to know in life I learned through failure with IKEA.
We are missing an exit.
The picture instructions are very helpful but do you think there are enough pieces for a 68-story condo?
C'mon.  Please.  Just call that IKEA guy.
I know," Build a Better Blah Blah Blah "
That’s interesting, the instructions are made of a very strong glue-like substance.
I can't figure out this crazy maze!
What's "mouse trap" in Swedish?
How many trials did it take for us to realize this isn't democracy?
Walls are obsolete, we need a better mousetrap.
How on Earth can we get started? It’s all written in Swedish!
The say if we build it, we will appreciate it more.
Hey, let's put this on YouTube.
Trust me, this is a much better promotion than it seems.
I hate when they get the experiments from Ikea.
Ok, I’ve got the blueprint to the Maze. We’ve got to memorize it now, as once they give us the drugs we’ll be useless at finding our way..
I hate DIY. Why couldn't we just buy the premade maze?
I know it’s hard to see right now but I’m telling you there’s a distinct advantage for us here
It would be easier if it wasn't written in Japanese.
So the cheese wasn't included?
Unbelievable. We're done for the day, says here, "Cheese not included."
Don't worry, it's easy as cheese.
The true test is the directions are in Swedish.
Why they give us mazes when we are into Parkour is beyond me.
Seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a piece of cheese.
You work for the mouse now. So get to work on Star Wars Land.
don't be silly, once we build it we're sure to find cheese at the other end.
We can rig it so that the cheese automatically gets ejected.
They promised me a lot more than cheese if we make the maze ourselves.
It's a scale replica of the store floor plan. Instead of cheese, there's a meatball at the end.
When we're done, it will look a-maze-ing.
This looks complicated. Go fetch us some Gruyère.
Do we still get the cheese if we have TaskRabbit do this?
Build it and I will come.
Must be extra packing material...
I thought you brought the cheese?
The upside is we can use this on our DIY  channel"
I’m telling you, the cheese wasn’t in the box.
Maybe we shouldn’t have ordered it from IKEA after all
I wish I'd known mazes came with instructions.
It will be a big beautiful wall.
Next time, buy from MICEA
Sweat equity
It a great puzzle, but it requires opposable thumbs.
How  dumb are they!
These experiments are becoming less and less fun
I thought you spoke IKEA
If you build it, they will come—with cheese.
This thing is no piece of cake.
I don’t see anything that says where to put the cheese.
Uh-oh ... cheese not included
I take it back. I’d rather have American over Swiss.
I want my cubicle down at this end, over there on the left, OK
I see the Allen wrench, but where is the rat-chet wrench?

It's the chase, not the cheese.
I think we can scale this to human size.
It's from Ikea, and the instructions say anyone can do it in twenty minutes.
Is this what they mean by “Stockholm Syndrome?”
It could be worse. It could have been a cancer test.

Can you build a better cheese trap?
Who needs Mickey when we have each other?
The architect is a real minimalist.
This one should keep Hem and Haw busy for a while
I’m seeing a contemporary with the great room right here.
These fools still do not understand that we 
could do any of these blindfolded...but what would be the fun in that?
Forget the walls! I look the open concept.
Screw the blueprints. Let's fill he whole damn thing with cheese.
'How to build a better mousetrap'. Rats! Heads or tails, nobody wins with these instructions. The Swedes should go back to the drawing board.
The map is inaccurate, nothing fits how can we make it work?
Learn from your President!
We should insist that a teaspoon of caviar is the grand prize!
I just hope we can find our way out once we're finished.

Let's check out the You Tube Video
Let’s just call the help line.
Let's build an IKEA for mice
And yet again, they're coming to us for a better mouse trap.

NASA should have had three people put this maze together and not left it up to us at the last minute. 
-Janet Ward Taggart
...and for obvious reasons, you don't use stucco.
You think it’s a coincidence that IKEA and Stockholm Syndrome both come from Sweden?!?
Assembly is kind of a pain, but I do get a kick out of the made up Swedish names.
If we leave some droppings the human will take over.
We’re the architects of our own misery.
I  can see why that could be confusing but Swiss cheese is not included.
Of course I don't need the instructions, does it look like I'm going to get lost?
I got it from IKEA.
I'm just saying, maybe modern consumerism is the real trap.
Who do they think we are, Pinky and the Brain?
We can sell these for $1.99 and the maps for $50.00.
Forget about the maze.  Let's build some condos.
Diagrams, instructions... Hey, they left out the cheese!
It looks like this 迷路 is going to be really 楽しい.
No, you're wrong. It's much better than an IKEA maze.
This will be amazing.
Amazing  - what you can do with this cheap crap!
Mom warned me about the mouse traps from Ikea.
I'll get on with making it, you find the rat.
Can you get my reading glasses?
I tell you, assembling it is half the fun.

You have to supply your own cheese!
If we build it, they might come.
Who ever told you mice could read blueprints?
DIY mazes !  There's no fun being a lab rat anymore.
I like it when they give up and stamp on it.
I was thinking of building a cubicle farm.
And at the end we'll have a TV and a can of poisoned beer.
I'm not mouseplaining.
Labor shortages, so they claim.
First that mouse trap.  Now this.  You have a dangerous mind.
If we make the maze complicated enough we may never get to the death trap.
When the maze is assembled we get Swedish meatballs and apple cake
This is total bullshit.
Let's eat the treat and forget the maze
I'm taking it apart.  Looked too much like a rat trap !
The only way to crack it is to build it.
It says it's a maze but there's no cheese. Ikea must be hiring cats these days.
And I thought my IKEA days were over.
Hoots man, they’ve gang agley!
Son, building a better mousetrap is not always a good thing!
But do we really want the world beating a path to our door?
Look, no matter what you do, they give you cheese!
What do you think Musfälla means?
Why do they always make these such a puzzle?
Trappa? Just another nonsense word.
Sacre bleu cheese!  It’s a blueprint for getting out of ze rat race mon ami!
Our ancestors are absolutely shocked.
From China
This one's different. They call it Maaz.
Should we tell them, Mice don’t do IKEA?
Let's try not to get lost in the details.
For best results, use money instead of cheese at the finish.
I'm amazed you think I can put this together.
Well, do you think we can use some help from the homeowner?
I hate these kits. They always forget the cheese.
Who orders cheese from Ikea?
"It’s always a maze for us. mice get exercise cages!
I think they call it a “Mazentrappen”
I knew we shouldn't have ordered this from IKEA.
It’s like a designer maze, but cheaper.
How are we going to get out of this thing?
The way I see it, we have two choices.
they got the cheese at IKEA
One minute I was nibbling on a Swedish meatball and the next thing you know I can home with this!
Did they include the cheese?
IKEA's instructions fail to point out that you have to have opposable thumbs.
No where on the Amazon listing did it say dyi.
Forget about the cheese were trying to get this bread .
Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese,
where's the English ?
We should've spent the extra money and bought the pre-assembled version.
What do you make of it?
We're on our own.  I think these are in Gerbil.
Rats!  It says "cheese sold separately."
Yep, we're gonna need a TaskRabbit.
Let's just go open concept and try making our own cheese.
Well, at this rate our hot tub will finished  in 8 years. That's probably our life span.
I heard they separated us into two test groups: HEMNES and MALM.
It was more fun when they came assembled
I knew that we solved that last maze too quickly.  Now they gave us IKEA!
They don't call me "Cheese Whiz" for nothing!
We used to just have to find our way out ..
I am puzzled also.
I hate when the cheese isn’t included.

Did IKEA move the cheese?
At least we don't have to administer our own injections.
I said I have an idea not an IKEA
It's the latest model. The challenge is to put it together, not to just run through it.
It depends on where we put the cheese.
We need some curvilineal aspects.
You left out the cheese Einstein!
It's amazing how much cheddar we are getting for this job
What if we build a duplex instead?
I'm not sure I fully understand English, Morty! But I think we're building a better mousetrap!
Where's the cheese?
That's the last time we buy furnishings from Squeakea
I say we DON'T built it and just eat the cheese.
they haven't even set up the trials !!
You first. You’re the one with the scholarship.
I know our best laid plans often go awry, which is why I'm suggesting we half-ass it this time.
Or... we could just keep it as a room.
Are you sure you ordered the chili con queso?
The humans will love this.
Or we can take one board and seal the entrance. The rapist and terrorist will not get in.
Where's the box with all the cheese? Damn it, Gerald!
As I'm sure you know, when you build a better mouse trap...
It was on sale at Ikea
Seriously, you're really going to read the directions?
Let’s make a maze.
That should make things more interesting
We’ll figure this one out without these cheesy instructions!
Why don't we just chew a hole through the wall instead?
I'm confused - aren't we trying to deconstruct the electoral college, not rebuild it?
Look, the sooner we get this done the sooner we get to eat cheese. So let's focus, okay?
Why would I make it hard?
It's no surprise that IKEA knows how to build a maze.
We are not putting it together; it stands for "I Kill and Eat All".
We've got the wrong blueprint - this is the simplistic maze for humans.
Let's go get the meatballs, and do this later.
These education cutbacks are getting out of hand.
Yeah, I know.  No fun.  But with science department budget cuts we have we have to build before we scamper.
Well, now we really are doing all of the work.
How about we just split the cheese and call it a day?
There's English and Spanish, but no Squeak.
We have to build it before we run through it, but what if we built
amaze even they couldn't figure out?
Only one way in and one way out.  It's a trap!
Curse that lazy psychologist !
Didn't we take this apart last week?
The instructions are entirely in Swedish.
I should have paid more attention in Psych class.
Now they expect us to build these things!
This is probably a test too.
I think the cheese comes in another box.
If we can do this the world will beat a path to our mouse hole.
Not only did they move the cheese, but now they want us to build the maze.
I don't even like Swedish cheese.
It sure seems like a lot of work just to get a piece of cheese!
These people are fools, letting us build this thing ourselves.
But we need a screwdriver, not an Allen wrench!
What happened to Part 26B, "Cheese"
By the time he figures these out, we'll starve to death.
If there's no cheese, what's the point?
It's right here in the parts list: "37. Cheddar, block of, one." I've looked everywhere. Someone seems to have moved my cheese.
The Build-a-Better-Mouse-Maze Challenge sponsored by Aged Vermont Cheddar Cheese.
These brainys' think, the only thing we use is our tooth?? c'mon, let them finish it
Make a straight line to the cheese.
Which model do you want? Cheese or Minotaur?
We’re missing the incentive.
Told you we should've sprung for the pool table.
I thought you said you needed help with an Ikea snack, not an Ikea hack.
It'll all make sense once we put it together, dear
Finding the cheese will be a lot easier than following these IKEA directions
Why did you have to go and order the version of the roof made out of swiss cheese?
Do we get rewarded with one of those Swedish meatballs from the lab tech if we figure this out?
Why don't we pass on attempting to put this together and go have some of their great meatballs?
What the heck, I say we just call it a labyrinth and leave it as is.
You had to find a lottery ticket; didn’t you? Big deal, what if we win? Does that mean that cats will lay off? I wouldn’t kid myself about that, there might be one hiding around the corner.
If you can figure out these Ikea directions, lunch is on me.
It was your idea to go to the Imousa store!
I don't the know about you but I don't think this is a good idea.
They really needs to stop buying lab equipment from Ikea
This house is going to look amazing!
You just had to bite him!
A mazing plan!!
It’s as if they’re testing us to see if we are smart or not.
Let's catch some Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Rats! IKEA expects us to build a better mousetrap ourselves.
Don't go the right way
It's a better mouse trap....They think....
We should have stuck to IKEA's Swedish meat ball garbage and not bought this goddam stupid maze!
What kind of clock did they say this was?
I don’t know about you but I think this  “DIY” stuff is getting out of hand
If we're gonna be in the rat race, we might as well OWN the rat race.
If they build it we will come.
Let's consider an open office concept without cubicles!
It doesn't come with cheese.
This looks simple. I don't know why everyone complains about assembling IKEA products.
I think they said corn. That when we finish building it, it turns into corn.
Don’t blame me. You’re the one who wanted more “hygge”.
These DIY mazes are frustrating!”

Robert Mayer,  Warsaw, I
I love these make your own meal places.
I think they're trying to trick us. Panel 
B goes in slot A this time."
Well, the good news is, if we complete this task, they may decide to let us out of  that scary clinical trial!
I think these instructions might have been easier to follow in their original Chinese.
I'd feel more motivated to do this if we had some cheese.
Go slow--few mice can conquer an IKEA maze.
We could build it so that the right hand rule doesn't work!
This should keep the humans out.
Let's make it easy on ourself and just make some shelving.
It's an upgrade of my old maze to—cubicles!
What?!  Cheese not included?!
It is supposed to promote mental acuity."
I like the empowerment but not the second shift.
I think its fine, just the way it is
Even a cat can understand this. Go get me a cat. I can't make sense of it at all.
I didn't see any cheese in the box."
Well, it has every other language. Keep looking for "squeak".
I saw one just like it in Dwell.
Four years at Stanford and this is where we end up?
No kitchen.  No bathroom. Not even a roof.  Whoever designed this was no brain surgeon!
They tell me this is how Mickey started too.
Darn - they shorted us by one screw...
This calls  for   an  inside   the  box idea.
Just be glad that that we’re in the control group and have all the required parts.
Yes, it's another unfunded educational mandate so it can't be too difficult.
This is what happens when you are an IKEA lab mouse.
I give up. How much does IKEA charge for assembly?
Yeah,even the Psych Department is suffering cut-backs.
They didn't include the cheese.
Maybe getting a maze at IKEA wasn't such a good idea.
Do you read Swedish?
Do you happen to have opposable thumbs?
Just like life, a handful of screws and your boxed in.
I know you can find out how to do it online.
I just love this new STEM Curriculum - it's so self-directed!
I ordered their "amazing Swiss cheese," but they must have heard me say "a maze using a Swedish scheme."
It's like a maze trying to follow these instructions!
Careful.  The directions are written in Catalonian.

Ikea must think we are stupid
You were at my wedding, Denise...
Are you sure this is how Walt Disney started?
They think we're not smart enough to do this.
Yes, there's a penalty if we don't assemble the maze. Now what part of double jeopardy still eludes you?
Is that cheese that I smell on your breath?
Oh great. Cheese sold separately.
Oh shit, it says "cheese not included"
Can we call a service in?
We could hire a TaskRabbit... but their stinky pellets and, ugh, that carrot breath!
Think about it. If we build it, they will come.
We're finally living the American dream!! We're gonna be chasing a tinuly piece of cheese in a labyrinth of our own making, while Trump will be eating the whole thing!!
It’s an original Mice van der Rohe. Classic Mauhaus.
Dr. Schroedinger designed it.
I know it looks bad.  But that's how a trickle-down economy works.
Think of it as a maze.
Do you think the humans will find the pizza using sense of smell alone?
The problem with these Do-It-Yourself mazes is that you can never add enough closet space.
I wish we had opposable thumbs.
Did you say futile or feudal?
Forget this. Let's go get some more meatballs.
Cheese not included.” What a rip-off
We're going to need a bigger piece of cheese.
Algernon are you in the carpenters union?
No, honey, it doesn't come with the cheese.
They forgot the scientist.
It is obvious that we are in the non placebo group of this clinical trial.
Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose?
This is easier than hacking Facebook!

Look, if we pull this off, we’ll be rolling in cheese for the rest of our lives!
Start with the cheese," I always say

Last time we go to IKEA.
Amaze me.
I thought you had the combination.
Do they realize we don't have opposable thumbs?
It's what gods do. If we assemble the maze, they'll put cheese at the end of it.
Sorry, Ike, I was trying to order you a maze to play in. I guess the agent couldn’t understand what I wanted.
Don't kid yourself.  This is the easy part!
These instructions are so crazy, you would think a cat wrote them. And how will we ever find the cheese?
Donald, are we on the inside or the out?
I don't see anything about the cheese.
I can't believe that somebody thinks this is funny.
This mouse pad is more useful to us than the one IT thought they had ordered.
The cheese is always at the very end.
In order to conquer, you must first understand
Ever get the feeling we're just pawns for science and human advancement?
I don't think we want to build a better mousetrap!
I can't figure out where to start.
I think we should just eat it.
Please tell me you can read Swedish
Finding your way out's the easy part.
Late night at Ikea: This’ll throw ‘em, Mike.

If we don't install these walls, it will be much easier to find the cheese!
When did IKEA get into the maze business?
It is harder to get the cheese, now that IKEA is a sponsor
How about we just keep the cheese by the door?

D. Ginsberg
This is one extreme diet plan
No, I don't see cheese in the parts list.
once we had to learn how to get out of the maze,now we have to build it first
Yeah, I understand it is a new collaboration between the APA and IKEA.
I asked Blind Larry to help, but he's still recovering from that carving knife attack.
Looking at instructions is cheating.
It's too much of a runaround trying to put this together.
Use the simple design.  It is for testing humans.
The scientist will be drop-shipped from the lab in a box with air holes.
This is gonna be amazing.
Do I have to tell my ex if I tested positive for plague?
All instructions included.  I'm a-mazed.
We need an IKEA planning tool for this.
Let's just catch up on Stranger Things.

After all this they forgot to pack the cheese!
The only step is to find a post-doc who isn't crying into a bowl of Ramen.
Let's hack it into a cheese factory!
Are you sure this is the pre-fab house kit we ordered?
It’s a Sol LeWitt.
George, stop complaining and help. Since the budget cuts, the lab says we have to build our own mazes if we want the cheese.
What an a-mazing construction opportunity.
Never read this stuff until you get stuck.
Cutbacks. You get started on this. I'll start making the cheese.
'The directions are pretty cheesy'.
Now's our chance for creative immortality. Let's call ourselves The A-maze-ing Rats.
Why should we build a maze? Let's think outside the box.
I went to Ikea snack bar for cheese and.....
Which route do you prefer: red, fast; blue,easy or yellow,short?
Why don't we just make a cheese machine?
It may be annoying now, but you'll thank me when we are eating Swedish meatballs instead of Swiss cheese.
I don’t know what you had to do ti get these secret plans, but itwas worth it.
Nance – we're truly prisoners of our own design.
Why do the instructions always seem like they’re written in a foreign language?
Frankly, I think it reads better in Swedish.
Damn these IKEA instructions!
Now this is just demeaning.
The heck with this.  Let's fill it with cheese.
If we make a mistake, we could be trapped.
How many ways will they think of to give us their cancers?

I assure you, it’ll be less confusing than finding a bathroom at the Met
How many trials do we get?
Next you want me to put together those 17 cribs, right?
I'm leaning towards open concept"
Something tells me we should make MULTIPLE copies of this.”
Didn't you ask for the instructions in braille... and where's George?
The Lab Director couldn't understand the assembly instructions.
Thank goodness we're in the group that was given the "how to" instructions. NOT!
It's a recipe for Swedish meatballs.
Big enough to trap a human would be better.
Now we have to make our own maze with this rat pack
The results are in the hands of the unpaid graduate assistants. We eat well with this over the years.
Let’s forget the instructions and do a Mondrian.
Let's make it a dead-end, you know like a comment on Brexit.
I thought you had the gene to figure this stuff out!
I’ve never had to build one before.
They say the Ikea instructions are easy enough for cavemen - and show me the mouse that can't outsmart a caveman.
Can't we just eat the cheese?
We're going to need a dictionary.
“When you’re done you can start on the exercise wheel...”
Let's hide those screws, they're building a better mousetrap.
Of course I can't read Swedish.
Another species succumbs to the Ikea affect
Do you think we'll need to acknowledge funding from Ikea in our research paper?
It worse than you think. Not only did the company cut back R&D's human staff, they eliminated our cheese budget.
I can’t stop thinking about those Swedish crumb-balls.
The sacrifices of the revolution were not in vain, comrade; the arc of the universe still bends towards justice. Now we alone are the masters of destiny.
I've seen humans go crazy trying to solve this riddle. Surely the secret of cheese lies in these strange symbols.
Have you ever gotten lost? Look at these plans!
The last thing one needs is another maze. But I can smell it’s a real deal!
Let's leave off a few; it will save us time now and later.
Hm, this doesn't resemble a barn at all.
Just be grateful it's not a better mousetrap.
Well, the world ws created in seven days--we should at least be able to match that.
DIY is cool, and you know I love meatballs, but why uphold this system we could overthrow entirely
I told you the Swedish can't design a good maze.
ikea
Let's just call it a day and play them some Mozart!
You said it came with cheese included.
It was on special at IKEA.
The seller assured me that this is the rodent model of the Trump Wall!
For once I'd like them to build a better mousetrap!
Why did you have to order this from Ikea?
Ikea calls it "Mousen Maze", but I'm going to call it "home".
Live out side the box.
Do you know Swedish?
Can’t we just eat them?
What now? It’s not in mouse language
No, you go back to the store for the missing cheese.
If we study these plans for the maze we can beat the others to the prize
The president stated this will be the next White House...
The last one was too easy.
Mexico helped build it.
We have to leave Sweden!
It won’t matter. There are always some leftover pieces.
I told you we shouldn’t have bought it at Ikea.
I don’t understand  the instructions!
It's a habitrail for humans
This is the last time I order a maze from Ikea.
Damn, I hate IKEA!
I'm going with Scandinavian Design.
You can’t read either, huh?
This seems like a lot of work to keep our cheese cravings in check.
There's lots of variations, but the cheese is always in the left corner.
All this just to get a piece of cheese?
I just find the aroma of Swedish meatballs a distraction.
It looked a lot bigger with the cheese in the picture.
It's the perfect startup. We're our own beta testers.
Just as I thought, "Cheese not included".
It means the lingonberry bait isn’t included.
You need a degree from Mouse Institute of Technology to follow these instructions.
this IKEA stuff is tough
Not only does the Irrgång give us brain-stimulating challenges, but it also can hold our entire media collection.
Ok, you go left, I will go left-to-center. Let's see who wins!
The study said building furniture together can strengthen a relationship, in mice.
Nipsey, I have found all the secrets to building a better one!
I was born in Sweden
I could go for a Swedish meatball right about now.
My agent didn't tell you? I just run em.
Better give IKEA a call.
Let's take the tube to Piccadilly Circus like the lab rats.
So if we build it, will the cheese come?
First IKEA, now this!
What do you mean? Ikea always has arrows on the floor!
The cheese packets are sold separately.
You would have to insist on shopping at IKEA.
I don't know how to use a screwdriver.  Do you?
Why do they always insist on writing these things in English?
Mazel  Tov.
Fuck it.  Let's just eat the horsemeat meatballs that came with it.
Not to bad considering you ate the last ten pages of the instructions!
Cut to the chase - where does the cheese go?
Hey Clarence, they forgot the cheese.
Ikea lot of cheese in our future.
Oh, No! It's an IKEA maze.
Hey...wait a minute..isn’t IKEA Swedish for mousetrap?
'IKEA - Swedish for Common Sense'
But where do we put the cheese?
We’re supposed to build a better mousetrap?
Getting through the maze is easy. Understanding the assembly instructions is the real challenge.
I don’t think we should follow these directions.
IKEA does mazes, too?!
It didn't look like this at IKEA
I thought it came fully assembled.
Building a better mouse trap has to be sabotaged
I say we don't assemble the maze,
& then finding the cheese will be way easier.
Come to think of it, we should just serve the crackers with a little cucumber dip, instead.
We are missing two screws and a block of cheese...
Damn. It says right here, "Cheese not included".
No, the plans say to build the maze before we go get the cheese.
These mazes get more challenging every time.
I have an idea, lets leave out the walls, it'll be easier to find the cheese!
Sad that they never provide instructions on how to chew on them properly!
I thought I told you...stop getting the mazes from IKEA!
you do know after we built it IKEA will dissect our brains?
I told you nothing good came from human stores.
It goes against everything we were ever taught, but what do you think about ... open concept?
Calm down. We just need to put into perspective.
Can we skip this part and just go to the cheese?
Ikea states it can be assembled in five hours...if you understand Latviešu valoda.
Mazes-schmazes. I'm thinking three bedrooms, two baths, walk-in closet, hardwood floors, central heat and air.
I ordered this gopher trap from Amazon. Let's put it together and see if we can trap any gophers!
As if the gig economy isn’t already a maze, now we need to build our own.
Let's try YouTube. These IKEA directions are impossible.
Do we need the Philips head or the other kind? See, that’s why we never finish these things.
Looks like IKEA recycled its floor plan for the maze instructions.
It's in Spanish and there is no one left to traduce esta maldita cosa.
It's called the irrgång gömdost.
Wow. This may turn out to be amazing.
Ummm...wait a minute. I don’t see any cheese.
Well, better not count on compté.
bit of more than we could chew
I'm glad that "Build a better mousetrap" idea is written in Japanese.
The IKEA guy said we could do it in a flash.
Batteries  not included  either.
Whad'ya mean there wasn't any cheese in the box when you opened it?
It says there's supposed to be a piece of cheese in here, but I'm not seeing it.
When we were told to solve the maze I didn’t think they meant to actually put it together
At least the cheeseballs were good.
If we can get thru the IKEA instruction maze, the real one should be easy
Yeah, but those meatballs were delicious.
I came in for their famous cheese, how about you?
Looks like it'll be easier to just wait and find the cheese the old fashioned way.
They left out a piece: the cheese.
I'm TaskMouse, you need TaskRabbit
Well, whose idea was it to get this thing from IKEA?
There's always one piece missing, why does it have to be the cheese!?
I'm completely lost in these directions.
Cheese is missing; typical IKEA.
Oh great, it's in Swedish.
Another maze.  I'm not wasting my time for anything less than Brie.
I think I am ready for an open concept.
It's a new test for genius level intelligence.
Ikea is the worst grocery shop ever!
Great. The directions are in Chinese.
I got the plans from that guy selling college admissions...
Wouldn't it be easier to do take-out?
Is this in our job description?
I told you, Ikea has everything!
They really call it 'Cheddarseekin'?
If you think this is bad, just wait 'til we get to the roof.
I don't think this is right they sent us the wrong maize
So this is how they plan to build a better mousetrap!
I can’t understand these instructions, they’re all in Swedish
Wow, Cinderella’s dress was a piece of cake compared to this.
I f we do this right, they'll be chasing their own tails and never find us.
They're testing Adderall on me, and running the mazes got too boring. Now, do you see piece C2 anywhere?
"Who cut the cheese?
Don't complain.  IKEA's new CEO is one of us.
You couldn't spare two cheese cubes for the assembly service?
IT'S BETTER FOR ENTERTAINING IF WE HAVE AN OPEN FLOOR PLAN
This is a real puzzle.
I say we call Task Rabbit.
Says here they are trying to build a better mouse trap
Don't you hate Mousekea?
SWEDISH RHAPSODY  or Norwegian Wood
Let's build a maze that's not too difficult to get out of.
Listen, if you DON'T follow the instructions, we'll never find our way out !
As I see it, x=1(4999/5000)aN
Squeak squeak FJÄLLBO squeak.
What a disappointment!  "Cheese sold separately."
When you finish it, they reward you with cheese.
We're going to have to think outside of the box on this one.
I warned you about IKEA.
You fool! These instructions are in Swedish. Next time we are buying from Wall-Mart. They write in American!
Let's put it together backwards!
IKEA doesn’t include the cheese with its maze plans...bummer!
The cinnamon rolls were really good, though.
Let's make this easier on ourselves and not put up the walls at all.
You should be able to put this together from memory, Larry.
We really just went for the meatballs.
It's not big enough. The humans can look over the side.
Not sure if I trust these instructions there doesn’t appear to be a way out.
I ate the cheese already, so we don't have to bother building the maze after all.
If we build it they'll come
I think you've got a screw loose somewhere.
Look for, "Button pushy fun yum."
I hate it when you don't get everything you need. I don't see anything here about opposable thumbs.
Funding for science is down. Of course we have to build our own maize.
I am not buying it from IKEA anymore. They always forget the cheese.
There’s no place to put the cheese.
The things a fellow has to do around here just to get a piece of lousy cheese!
As your contractor, I’m gonna promise you the world, disappear for three weeks, only to return to build the maze of your dreams.
Bad news, it says ‘cheese not included.’
Once we get in there, you're on your own
Shouldn't a maze also have an exit?
They say just 5 seconds a day improves your intelligence
Why can't Sheldon just vandalize the mousetraps like the other kids?
...And when we build it, they will come...
Just sayin - we always end up with extra screws on Ikea projects!
Don't worry, I've been to enough IKEA stores that I know how to put this together".
It doesn't say anything about cheese.
Don’t get me wrong, I am devoted to Cinderella. But I swore off IKEA furniture when they started selling mouse traps.
*mouse noise*
I hate Ikea...
Boy we haven’t even started yet and I’m already lost
They want to see how long it takes us to get through this maze; then we can start on the bookshelf.
It can't be too hard. I ran one in the psych lab.
I am never buying anything from Ikea ever again.
I think we're missing a piece of cheese
I don't get paid enough for this!
The other team doesn't get instructions.
You had to pick a bunk bed?
My first free-lance instruction sheet for IKEA.
This time I’m adding a panic room so that you can’t find the cheese.
Remind me never to shop at IKEA again.
Damn. "Food not included."
This is so not fair, having to put together our own traps, isn't that like planning your own funeral?  Plus if we're smart enough to build it, why would we step in it!
Ikea was your idea, not mine.
Of course, if they expand their walk-in closet one more time, we’re going to have to move.
a-MAZE-ing!!
What's the Chinese word for "cheese"?
It says 'Köttbullar Maskine'... I don't trust it
These plans are amazing!
I think we need - a key ah
We’re missing the piece of cheese.
So what’s the play?
Cheese. We’re missing the cheese.
I think they bought it at IKEA
The dog only got a bell."
I’m pretty sure we are 
missing the cheese.
"Let's make it look really challenging and then we"ll eat much better"
Rats! Another Ikea maze.
You know, you really don't need this thing to show me how smart you are.
I don't want to do this either but keep your mind on the cheese.
Ikea's amazing.
I think we need opposable thumbs for the next steps
Wait a minute.... let's just go get the cheese and cut out the middle maze.
They left something out.  Should we make it Swiss or Gouda?
Ok we're missing a screw for the cheese maze
It says here there's supposed to be cheese. I don't see any cheese in there do you? Fine, you look...and count the screws.
I bought it from those cats at IKEA, man!
Admit it -- between the two of us, I'm the more 'out-of-the-box thinker.
But I just don't agree that an open floor plan is passe.
I TOLD YOU IKEA NEVER SUPPLIES THE CHEESE
If we stop right now, we'd be saving ourselves from more than one headache.
Explain to me again why bother?
''Instead of having us go through the maze, they want us to build it.''
Simple, my tail.
It's a meatball dispenser.
It's vegan: no cheese.
It's a lot less expensive than joining a gym.
When we get to the middle, is there a Swedish meatball?
Just promise me, next time we're paying someone from IKEA to assemble it, ok?
Don’t worry. They never finish these IKEA projects.
I think we should form a committee to complete this renovation.
Funding Cuts--preassembled costs extra
Let's just elope.
<%#!! IKEA
it will be easy, we can do this, right? right?
No, no, I let you do it last tine and we were lost for a week!
If these are IKEA instructions, we’ll get lost before we even build the maze
We might have been seduced by the meatballs.
I tell you,if we get this right we can get a slot on Shark Tank.
First we need the OSHA safety course.
Looks like we are in nutria territory - amazing!!!!
Hey, it was your idea to nibble into an Ikea store.
So, should we chew this up first?
No, not alphabetical. I'm the PI so my name goes first.
The IKEA guys said the easy part was putting it together since we’ve ran so many.
I'm confused . go get the cat.
If we just memorize the plans for this cheese maze, 
we'll eat like kings!
Oh No! It says, 'Cheese not included'!
How about some Swedish meatballs before we get lost in the maze project?
Apparently, the infrastructure budget still hasn't been funded.
Drats! The guy at Ikea  told us it would be a breeze to put it together!
Forget the process. Where’s the cheese?
Ikea - where else would I go?"
What next... build them a better mousetrap!?!
I say we break for some meatballs.
Let's ditch these instructions and stay with the open floor plan.
Look, we can make life easy for ourselves or hard.
'It's good that these instructions are in mice type.'
We see the bolts, but where are the nuts? I am hungry!
I can't follow these directions.
I’m telling you, IKEA labs was not the way to go.
If we build it, the mice will come to the maze of our dreams.
Don't be intimidated.  The humans aren't that smart.
Caption ? We don't need no stinkin' caption!
It says here that we can build this thing faster than we can run it!
I think it'll be a fun place.
I hate this large print.
Yes honey of course I could finish the directions, but I'm getting a funny-bad feeling about this 'present' from your friends parents.
Let’s just eat the cheese and return the maze to Ikea.
Everytime I try to build an IKEA-maze, there are parts missing.  Let’s box it up and take it back. Again. 
Jon E —Truckee
Looks like we're missing the cheese.
My fear is that if we complete this it will upset our work/life balance”
Who is this for?
It doesn't come with the cheese!
It's complex, but I added a bathroom.
I never understand these IKEA assembly directions.
You should be aware that if we are successful, it could lead to our demise.
You sure you want to build a better mousetrap?
It’s going to look great on my college application!
We’ve got to stop shopping at IKEA!
It’s amazing the things you can find at IKEA.
We'd better make this bigger if we want a human to fit inside.
Life was less boxed-in in our little hole
You'd think IKEA would take into consideration our lack of opposable thumbs.
The really smart thing to do is grab the cheese and run!
It's called "LABYRINT." And if we build it right, they'll give us meatballs.
I'm telling you, those researchers are going to be truly amazed.
Leave it to Ikea to build a better mousetrap
Sure, it looks easy. But how will they learn if we keep rescuing them?
Do you understand Swedish by any chance?
At least Scandinavian scientists recognize our real potential!
Let them keep ordering from Ikea. Who cares!
Simplicity and common sense should characterize planning and strategic direction.
We build it, see...we break records, see...cheese and stud fees for life!
Don’t give me that innocent look!  It says right here, “Cheese, 1 each.”
I’ve heard you get Swedish fish as a reward if you solve this puzzle.
There will be cheese in all the rooms
I feel like these directions are having us go around in circle.
See, right here it says, “Cheese not included.”
No.We already called Ikea
Ya, you betcha!
Doesn't matter how we put it together, we're still rats.
We should've stopped solving the mazes.
I heard they are having funding issues.
The scientists couldn’t figure this one out so now it’s up to us.
We are going to make our own Ikea Store
Damn! It says maze cheese not included.
Humans don't seem to understand that the shortest path to your goal is a straight line.
Great plan, Genius! Did you miss the small print - "Cheese not included?
It shouldn't take long to train the new lab assistant.
These IKEA directions are for the birds.
A maze with no cheese.  What'll they think of next?
Why don't we just build a Tiny House and call it a day...!
Since when did Ikea start making mazes?
Remember, the more complicated we make it, the more cheese we can charge for cheat sheets.
If you complete the maze you get Swedish meatballs.
You'd think that Ikea's instructions would be in Ratish!
Did you know the cheese was sold separately?
You do realize that people can just reach past the whole maze part for the cheese, right?
Ikea's looking for a better mousetrap.
You and your damn Swedish meatballs.
Did you get this from Mauskia?
I was envisioning more of an open floor plan.
When I said you were amazing, this is not what I meant...
Maze shmaze, let's go raid the pantry.
And we're being timed for this task.
Of course we could just eat the cheese, Stehpen. But where's the fun in that?
Tell me, what exactly is a maze going to teach us.
I guess Swedish mice understand these drawings.
Beats me what this is about
What happened to the cheese, Eddie?
You want to pass Psych 101, don't you?
I always wanted to be a game designer!
Hmm, I don't see the catch and release part in these directions.
Screw it. Let's call "Opposable-Thumbs-R-Us."
Make it easy, so even Post-Docs can get it.
I’m thinking the brie room should open into a gouda gallery but I’m torn as to whether the master should have an en suite or a feta suite.
Now Arnie, let's stick to the plan!
I told you it was an awful idea to go to IKEA.
Maybe it's easier if we leave it the way it is.
We should have left after the Swedish meatballs.
This doesn’t come with a roof.
I knew I should've taken Swedish.
Who the heck is Abraham Levitt?
I feel like we’re making this harder than it needs to be

I think we need the cat-alog.
Look, it's not a better mousetrap!
Ay,there's the rub, there is no cheese.
Hey this looks like the floor plan for an IKEA store.
"Cheez!  These are the original drawings. Ain't it awful what our ancestors had to go through?"
It ends with "A Job Well done is its own Reward"
Let me help. I've put together lots of Ikea mazes.
Sorry, it only comes with Swedish cheese.
Tom told me these Ikea instructions are complicated.
All my instincts tell me to ignore this sheet of paper."
After we finish, we'll need to get informed consent from our subjects.
Trust me, we will bond forever when this is done.
When  this  maze is completed; we  will  get
lost finding  the cheese!"
Should Task-Rabbit this?
I sang read Chinese, can you?
It’s a TRAP!  You can get in but there is no way out!
First they tap us to help them solve mazes. Now this. Exploitation.
I guess the Swedes opened a new lab here.
According to this parts list we're missing the Big Cheese"

This is a mazing
To hell with building a maze -- we'll use this to break out of here.
IKEA has taken all the fun out of it...
It says to build the sealed room from the inside.
Not just for us!  For our children and grandchildren.
It’s too complicated already.
I do it for the adventure, not for the cheese.
Let's get TaskRabbit to tackle this.
Another silly mousetrap entrepreneur.
...and then the idiot in the lab coat brings the cheese
I don't know where to begin. This manual reads like a labyrinth.
The neighbors have a glass ceiling on theirs, should we get one too?
Please tell me you didn't buy this maze in birch.
Look we can either struggle with this or  go on a pestilence bender.
But before we start IKEA says the make sure everything is here!
How do you call this gym?
Jeez...I don't know...I thought we agreed on an open concept floor plan!
Let's build it so when we go in, they will think we're stupid.
We should have just gotten the Swedish meatballs.
And to think IKEA's founder didn't live to see this.
Wait, the cheese isn't included?
It's amazing how easy this is.
I told you studying french was a mistake.
Seems like a lot of work for the köttbullar treat."
The scientists called it "outsourcing." Yeah, I don't like it either, but f we build the maze, finding the cheese should be easy.
Do you think we'll ever get through this?
Let's build a wall!
MICKY YOU HAVE TO  ASSEMBLE  IN SUCH A WAY
Two Summers at Ikea and you can't build this?

I'm telling you Kevin.. it's a trap!
Let's eschew the instructions.
I found a maze while wandering the IKEA maze.
What does " Complete Assembly Required" mean?
When you suggested we play while the cat's away, I had something pretty different in mind.
Drats! The cheese is missing.
Last time was worse. They made us put together a mouse trap.
Do you really think you can build a better mousetrap?
When we finish the Mayze, should we do the Kaage or the Träppe?
Do you think Ikea would put this together for us?
Should we just call TaskMouse?
The instructions say, “cheese not included.” Well, that’s disappointing.
We should probably save these plans for later.
Omg, no cheese, we’re screwed!
Why does the picture show a mouse in the maze?
I just went in for those meatballs.  But on my way out, I found this neat little model of the store.
Should we ignore the peel and stick tile ?
These instructions are Swiss to me!
I think we're screwed without the screwdriver.
John, we need to talk about your loose screws.
At the risk of getting caught in the trap of repeating myself: 
One mistake can be deadly.
This is the last maze from IKEA I ever purchase.
Wish we had these when we were part of the escape team the last time.
Or we could just go and get a cheeseburger.
We're missing a part. Where the heck is the cheese?
What? No, this is totally different. It's a 'mus labyrint' accent piece.
The real challenge is finding somewhere to put the cheese.
I hate these IKEA instructions.
It says the cheese isn't included
The nice thing about Ikea instructions is that pictures make it easy.
These plans seem pretty easy to follow.

I can almost taste the cheese already!
I’m thinking an open plan for better flow.
I told you we should've paid extra for the Ikea mazemaster, Gerald.
It was easier before IKEA took over these experiments.
But look at it this way - when we're done, we'll be the fastest solvers in the whole damn lab!
Squeak, these are amazing plans.
They can't figure it out, so they're leaving it to us.
It's not even Christmas Eve.

Let's make it easy.
These instructions are so complicated you'd think we were assembling a maze.
Let's build a labyrinth.  What's a labyrinth?  Wait and see.  I studied Labyrinths in college.  You will be amazed how quickly their cat Bumper will walk right into the trap.  And then the kitchen is ours.

This is going to be the best cat trap ever!
Damn there's one screw missing
Maybe it's just me, but I'm pretty sure they're trying to get us to build a better mouse trap.
Okay honey, the instructions say to 'confuse yourself' with this take-home maze."
"Did you dig into our swiss account for this, Tod?"
"It only cost a little cheddar, should be fine."
"I'm leaving you.
Oh, I know what's missing...the cheese.
I think the test is to throw out the instructions.
If we can get this thing put together it will be totally amazing!
We've been gypped!  The fine print says "Cheese not included."
Who told you that building a better mousetrap would be in our best interest?
Ikea sent us an Allen wrench instead of a Phillips screwdriver, so let's just use one of your incisors. You'll grow another one.
If we build it, Swiss will come.
No, they can get out of a maze.  I’m building a cubicle.
These instructions are impossible to follow, they're like a maze.
I don't understand why they're marketing this as 'Better.'
If you build it, they will come.
Oh boy! Home Depot is first on the list of "things-to-do."
Well, they say 'build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door,' but I have my doubts about this one.
A-MAZ-ING! I can't wait to see humans get lost.
Cheese not included? How are we supposed to smell our way across the maze?
Maybe it would be easier if we right click.
The next stage of the experiment is to build our own maze.
That Swedish scientist never told me we'd be spending all our time together in the lab like this.
There is no cheese at the end of this.
Did you remember the passports?
Someone said this would help me understand the phrase 'self-fulfilling prophecy
I feel trapped in this relationship.
Do you think she knows how crazy he is?
The pictures say it all. Only humans need words.
It must be a trick.
No problem, toss the instructions, lets make a cheese factory!
Sometimes I get lost in these directions.
This week's counseling session is going to be a doozy
We gotta hurry. The day they find out we build these things they'll stop thinking we're smart.
Oh my, we forgot the cheese!_Peter Moller, Bayside, New York
Cheese is included but batteries aren’t?
I’m a-mazed,aren’t you a-mazed.us building our own maze .its simply amazing
I can't stand trying to read Ikea instructions!
Why bother with a maze? We found each other!
Maybe we should have asked for the Ikea Assembly Service?
Swedish?  That and opposable thumbs.
I'm all for advancing scientific research, but this is getting ridiculous.
Master doesn’t like IKEA furniture.
You got this at IKEA, didn't you?
Let's not cut corners.
Looks like a pretty basic pattern, think it will fool a GPS?
It’s a build-your-own IKEA store.
Isn’t this more than what we bargained for?
Let’s just go back for some Swedish meatballs.
The maze was just the warm-up.
I could really go for some cheese while we're working on this."
"You'll get your cheese at the end!
Leaving aside there's no back door, there doesn't seem to be any place for us to store our cheese.
No we can't return the maze since someone decided to eat the cheese.
Let's move the cheese pantry to the back,- ah, HOME SWEET HOME!
IKEA is the shit!
By the time we construct the maze we’ll be late for lunch.
But if it's a conditional leaning experiment...we should stop!
We'll have to put the human trap on hold. I forgot my tool belt.
Let’s not even put the walls up. It’ll be so much easier to find the cheese!
All this for some cheese?
This plan is so amazing.  Let's run with it.
Even with the best guidance, we tend to create our own hell.
No worries.  The bigger, better mousetrap is still out there.
How would Mickey handle this?
I think they've figured out that we were stowaways on that flight from Stockholm!
Cubicals or offices?
You know I never follow the directions...how hard can it be??
Should we leave a note.
Proceed. Herein is the Amontillado.
You just make life harder than it has to be.
I liked walking through a maze to find cheese much better than this!
I got it at eekea.
If we do this right, we'll be swimming in cheese!
If we build a smart enough trap we can get big jobs at Ikea!
Don’t rat me out, I need that cheese!
This is for practice runs. Next week, we do it in the lab for cheese.
If we get this finished by lunch, I'll split the cheese with you!!!
Here's an idea, let's have a maze assembly party!
The Swedes have gone too far now!
My fault?  I just wanted to go for the meatballs.
Finally, the chance to build the place of our dreams.
This is a gravely underfunded research design.
We need to get this done before your mother gets here.
You won't get lost without the directions.
Don't you just love IKEA?
You eat the stack on the left and  I'll eat the stack on the right, and we'll see who throws up first!
When they make it hard we make it easy
FIRST let’s decide where to put the Swedish meatballs.
I'll need some Swiss Cheese before we get started.
I was thinking more like a Ponzi scheme...
It’s tough but who wouldn’t worry to be the Ikea mascot?
Turning every corner will be amazing.
We can also watch it constructed on a video
Huwai could sort out our problem before the cat gets us
But where's the cheese to hide in the maze?
Ok, perfect.  Let's see if the white-coat variety can complete it.
I thought it was supposed to come already assembled?
The IKEA parts are too big for our door!
They might buy an Ingatorp or Rådviken if they don't find the Bästis they came for until the end.
Is this how all Swedish research labs work?
Well, I think it’s a nice touch letting us assemble it, even if the IKEA instructions are confusing.
Let’s really mess with this guy, ok?
Relax, it says nothing about being "better
Does this qualify as an out of the frying pan into the fire situation?
Maybe we should call IKEA.
This is not the kind of intelligence test I’m used to.
Labyrinth? How should I know what a labyrinth is? D#$% these complicated instructions!
Hopefully this won't be as complex as that hedgerow maze from 'The Shining.'
The one time they’re not in Chinese.
Oh Please, you're telling me . . . you ate the cheese?
The instructions are skipping steps.  No words, just pictures. Where's the 'how to'?
How are we going to navigate this?
It will be amazing if we put this together correctly.
Oh, No! It says that the cheese is a separate purchase!
It looks like we’re missing the cheese for the end of the maze. Do you have something to tell me?
The budget cuts are so deep we have to build it ourselves, conduct the research, AND buy our own cheese.
oh real fucking nice guys. you know we can't read, we're mice. now we have to figure this out by looking at the pictures, which will take forever, and i gotta drive my fucking kid to little league practice
I know the plans call for a maze but I’m thinking open floor plan all the way.
When did Ikea get into the co-op business?
I told you we'd regret this modern doorway.
The kit doesn’t come with cheese?
I think we should just a get a running wheel instead.
This is their specifications on how  to build a better mouse trap!
You sure this is a bunk bed?
For that price, I assumed that the cheese was included.
Some assembly required?"  This  laboratory rat profession has really gone downhill since I began
Catnip not included?!?!  How are we supposed to lure Little Miss Munchies without any catnip?
'And you thought it was funny when I said we should learn English'
That's the last time I'll pick the red cheese.
Just don't let the cat out of the box.
I thought  IKEA assembly was supposed to be easy!
Instead of going to Ikea you could have just bought some cheese.
I've heard that we should keep this for reference in the future.
I told you getting it from Ikea was too much work.
I promise.  This will amaze you!
...this is why I told you not to buy the maze set from IKEA!
I'm aready lost, I can't understand these Ikea instructions.
Do we really want to build a better mousetrap?
I did it in 22 minutes: beat that!
I must confess, I've always found Swedish music very soothing, but as far as Swedish furniture manufacturers, they're nothing more than a BUNCH of old stoners."
The do it yourself maze is the ultimate challenge. This IKEA version with just diagrams is king.
These directions amaze me.
He's building a mouse maze! Let's get out of here!
Why don't we forget about this IKEA thing and just eat the cheese.
You forgot the fricken cheese?
Did you ever think it would be this hard to build a cheese grater?
Just our luck to be sent to psych lab in Sweden.
I’m not sure this is the jobs program our species needs.
I can't read.  Can you help me with this?
I have an ikea. Let's send out for cheese instead.
Did you already eat the cheese?
I like Ikea's innovations.
Wouldn’t it be smarter to skip this and go right for the cheese?
Where did you put the nuts?
It says "Top Secret."  It's Trump's plan for a wall game.
I'm nervous because the cat agreed to our  union demands rather quickly.
Let's just return it.
Apparently, the psychology of us building our own maze is the experience of making it results in a sense of accomplishment, making us like it that much more, so we will be inclined to buy more mazes to assemble.
Yeah, I know it is going to be hard to assemble, but the good news is this version doesn't include a trap.
Remember, state that it was built in Vietnam!
Say, I know - let's make this one really easy!
This should be a snap.
Ok, once we get it built, you do the freebie outside come on, and I sell the maps inside.  Got it?
A maze?
It's much easier if leave it this way.
Don't forget to include the small thermal exhaust port.
I always leave a scent trail so we can find our way back
We’ll be the first lowly rodents to have built a solid future.
Do you really think we can train them to give us treats with this?
Assembling this people decoy-trap is so much more complicated than the promotional instructions indicated.  Say cheese!
At least the maze had cheese.
I hate these IKEA mazes.
Hey Nick, I doubt thinking OUTSIDE the box is going to magically teach us Swedish.
I always thought these Ikea products were so cheesey.
Who moved my cheese, my ass.
There is no instruction on where the Cheese goes?
You said there would be Swedish meatballs everywhere. "It'll be easy," you said. Now we're stuck in an IKEA forever.
If we build it, will we leave?
Somebody got lazy.
I knew we should have picked up that 42-piece socket set.
Great--but where's our cheese, genius?
That’s a ratty job!
Congratulations! We've run the maze in record time.
We don't know Swedish...
How will we know if we're missing a piece?
But honey, I didn’t ask for a power struggle I asked for a screwdriver”.
These IKEA  instructions are a-mazingly complicated.
We could always ask the Norwegian rat in apartment 4-C.
This time, let's make it easier to get the cheese.
Impressive, Algernon. Now, how about we put this thing back together and just go through it like they asked us to?
We forgot to order the food packets.
What's the next goal?
It's called a MOYCE-MAAZ
I thought this could be a fun date night and they advertised free cheese at the end of the night.
We are building a maze, but of course a decorator would still be nice.
This trap better be worth it.
We have to get this right.  The Joneses died of starvation when they couldn’t find the cheese.
Build what and who will come?
Are you sure this isn't analogous to figuring out how to get Trump reelected?
xxxx IKEA
Why bother, you've already eaten the food reward...
I poked it with a stick and took it apart, and these're the plans for our mid-century family room!"
Self - determination.
Life is what you make  of it.
We're one screw short.

It amazes me how complicated these instructions are!
Is this part of the experiment, or is it yet another deterioration in our working conditions?
Yeah, well now we also have to build the &#%¥  maze.
I thought you said it came with the cheese included
Didn't someone say it comes with cheese?
If we create the maze ourselves, they will be amazed at how fast we can run it!
We not only have to put it together, we have to find cheese to put at the finish.
This is the honors class.
Did you move the cheese?
Damn! Reward not included.
You know Larry, it might have been easier just to call and exterminator.
You didn't order an Ostblock? That's the cheese, Gary!

In the fine print it says only one caution,  the convivence It is like eating cheese in a trap, you get immediate "advantages", but in practice you are caught!
We're just a couple of mice trying to build a better mousetrap.
When they say, "Build a wall," we say, "Put a maze in it!

What did you think this was all about? Fun and games? I want a child.
Here’s where we put the escape hatch.
I'm against fancy-schmantzy wallboard fixes. Old newspapers still do the trick.

I understand the concept, but why are we building it
They might select us for the “one gets food  and water and the other cocaine” experiment!
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you...to help me find a way.
How about a little cheese before we get started?
I'm starting to rethink the whole home-schooling idea
If Ikea would just write this in Mouse instead of these stupid pictographs.
We can build a better one now that we know that “ost” is cheese in Swedish.
The meese/ moosey boys hoho! Ha! WILL SURVIVE !!! The funniest thing I heard since hurricane Irma ha ho hee
Please tell me you're a transfer from Sweden.

What do you mean there’s a problem with the escape room design?
Wouldn’t you know it?  They forgot to put in the cheese!
Do we know anybody who can read Swedish?
OK, that looks easy enough. But how do we get it through the hole?
That's IKEA stuff!!! No human ever cracked the code!
where's our keeper when we need him?
These instructions are really Cheesy.
Never mind observing lab rats, they should study us!
If we don’t build it, they won’t come.
Just pretend the Allen key is a wheel and we'll have this done in no time!
It's about managing expectations.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Wow, we're thinking outside of the box!
I must admit,I'm completely lost.
Did you buy this at IKEA?
It appears to be plans for a house but there's no rooms, just halls.
The kids are going to love the new maze from Ikea!
I got it from IKEA.  We should be able to put it together in a snap!

I used a mouse on the computer to get this plan using Google.
I say we go to Ikea and get our money back.
Ikea, gotta love em!
Assembling the thing is much more 
rewarding than the double-blind studies.
Can we build the maze without compromising the scientific method?
The world will beat a path to our door
Are you really sure you want to build a better mouse trap?
I just don't know where to end!
If we build it will they come?
This is a whole new kind of mousetrap.
I don't see anything about cheese in these instructions.
This self assemble maze from IKEA is harder than it looks.
First this, then on to a better mousetrap.
What do you mean, 'The cheese isn't included'?

I still think a more open floor plan would better suit our lifestyle, Steven.
Why bother? It says cheese not included.
If anyone can figure this out, we’ve got it.
It’s ridiculous to have to build these mazes ourselves after science funding was cut!
I'm not sure what'll be more difficult... putting this together or finding out way out once we do.
Ahhh-Mazing Plans
Oh well, so much for building a better human trap.
Spared from Purdue trials to work for IKEA is still a loss.

I should have guessed when you said the maze was Funen.
They got too smart for the old trap.
We don't have to build a maze.  I for one would prefer something more open-concept.
This is an awful lot of work for a measly little piece of cheese.
I hate putting these things together. There always seems to be one piece left over.
These IKEA mazes are so complicated to assemble!
Don't you think it's a bit much expecting us to make the maze and then run in it too!
The plans look great but where do we recruit people small enough to run this maze?
Did you at least save the meatballs?
Maze schmaze, let's build a better mousetrap
Now we reassemble it and they will reload the cheese.
Let's make the partitions moveable.
Behavio
It looks like we are missing some of the parts.


.
Just think of it as two mazes in one.
We’re building an IKEA store.
Will you please just call the IKEA help line?!?
It’s finally on us to show them how to build a better mouse trap
Have you ever heard of gerrymandering?
We're building a better maze, not a mousetrap.
Let’s just put the cheese at the front.
Near as I can tell  – they want us to build a maze.
Just look for the last piece they put together.
Well it's more work for the same cheese, but I like the challenge.
Sigh, it’s from Ikea and doesn’t include the cheese.
You really want to play their game? I say pave it.
Jeez!  What y' gotta do to get a lousy piece of cheese around here!
Yeah, the map says this is the room where Scott Stapp wrote that song about being trapped in a prison he built himself, or some crap. I told you we should have sprung for the guided Creed tour, cheapskate
Nifty design but I say we use the materials to build a safe room first.
It's a bit of a fixer upper, but you'll be finding the cheese before you know it
Uh oh, we weren’t supposed to eat the cheese until the last step.
I do have to say that this "Age of the Maker Space" is a mazing!
Let's not forget to build in a Secret back door.
damn that Ikea !
First, we have to decide where the cheese goes.
this may end up looking like a thumb print
I knew learning to find the cheese wouldn't be good enough for them.
I'll finish this up, you go make some cheese.
Maybe if you run this past your iconic friend Mickey he can help us.
These plans are so cheesy.
IKEA didn’t say anything about cheese sold separately...
Here he comes to save the day, Ikea mouse is on the way!
This IKEA maze has me stumped.
Mice don't do very well on this map of Houses of the Rich and Famous.
I think the most important piece is missing.
All you have to do is jump over at the other end .
I got a sinking feeling when I heard they were ordering  from Ikea.
I told you not to shop at Ikea.
We can have a lot of fun building our own maze in there."         Richard Coan  (rwcoan@cox.net
Ikea? They forgot the cheese.
Y ou always have to get these kits... But can you read Swedish?
Look, if you want future generations to exist you’ll help me build a better mousetrap.
It just has to look challenging to the stupid humans.
We're never traveling to Sweden again.
I found the directions for the Maåze.
Opposable thumbs not included!?
Wait until the people at IKEA see this!
You're right.  We should have bought the already assembled playpen.
Catch the moment Jane. We are doing it The Rainbow in Berkshire style
You said you knew how to do it last time! Let’s just hire someone and call it a day”
When were finished, they will bribe us to keep our mouth shut!
This is IKEA's idea of simple and a-mazing?
We're missing the L brackets, so much for the maze.
I think these particular scientists are really phoning it in on this study.
"You'd think a guy with a Nobel Prize would know we don't have opposable thumbs
This is what happens when you buy from Ikea.
Looks like their research proposal wasn't fully funded.
How about this time we skip building the maze and just go straight for the cheese?
I say we alter these plans a bit and see how long it takes them to figure it out.
Homo sapiens was much smaller than we thought!
The instructions aren't in squeaks.
You think the STEM grant would have covered assembly!
Ikea's foray into the laboratory equipment market has gone as expected revolutionizing the industry
This design won’t pass code.
Let's do some inside the box thinking.
Mr. Maggot in the foyer with the lead pipe.
I'm almost positive our friends can eat through this."
Textbook bait and switch, I'm afraid. Cheese sold separately.
Skip the fun stuff.  Lets go with an open floor plan.
But we don't have opposable thumbs, that's why I suggested Modular Tiny Maze.
OK, we've unwrapped the cheese, what's next?
No! Not another  Maze. Let's build a race track.
Sports betting is legal now.
Our friends will enjoy racing and we'll take a cut
for the Mouse-House
When we finishing running this maze they'll take a selfie with us and throw away the trap.
Careful!  It's a trap!
But if we build it for them, they’ll probably just hand over all the cheese.
All I know is, if we DON'T build it, there is definitely no cheese at the end of it.
I'm not really sure where to start.
Let's forget about it.  IKEA left out the cheese.
I didn’t see the cheese anywhere in the box. Did you, Allen?”
“Moh.
Keep it simple, stupid.
Next, I want to build a better mousetrap.
I saved a lot of money at IKEA.
Who but us to make it better?
there is no cheese in this manual!
They said they'll pay in Camembert instead of that lousy cheddar they give us for figuring these things out.
Every Christmas it's the same damn thing, last minute rush to put these together and get 'em under the tree.
How can we trip up Alan?
Thank goodness this isn't IKEA.
Because she got the one at Columbia before I realized our old landlord already let the one at Plum Island to a rat.
My parents got the map in advance from Rick Singer.
Okay, we build a maze ... but let’s not make it too tough
These are instructions to build a better mousetrap, you dope.
Honestly, we should just hire a TaskRabbit rabbit.
My thinking is if we finish it in one afternoon, there'll be cheese in the center by morning.
It looks simple enough a caveman could put it together.
This is ridiculous, the directions are in human.
Do you speak Dutch?
I'm a little lost in these instructions.
'Minimalist luxury in less than one square foot' seemed so liberating when we were at the IKEA store.
It is obvious from these instructions that they have never been in a maze.
They’re letting us build our own maze.
Fuckin’ IKEA!
I was  content too  let  them keep extracting  sperm samples from  me at  the lab  in exchange for  pieces of cheese but you  had to  come to this  God forsaken place because you  smelled  cinnamon rolls.
There are instructions for an Ikea dresser, but if it ends up being a maze like last time. I’ve got some practice getting out.
Do you that night it matters where it says to start building from the back and work toward the door?
IKEA drives me crazy,” this is not how you build a better
Mouse trap.
Suzy, I think the men in the white lab coats want us to build a better mouse trap so they can take credit for it.
We need to start on the last page otherwise will be trapped
The screws are not from IKEA.  Be careful.
We need to stop buying our mazes at IKEA.
I told you we could build a better mousetrap.
I thought there would be cheese.
This is the hardest part.
Well we figured out the Swiss Cheese...
IKEA  pay sucks but the benefits package is good.
First, let's decide where to place the cheese.
Nobody will be able to escape our maze!
All the humans are doing it...
If we can do this, IKEA will let the human subjects try.
You build; I solve it.
Lehman Bros. 2008 Edition.... are you kidding me?
OK. 
Academic challenge:
1) Build, 2) Leave, 3) Cheese
We’ll just call customer service and explain they forgot to include the cheese.
Read this first, huh? Good thing I asked; I was just gonna leave droppings all over it.
Damn Ikea instructions!
Can you translate the Danish instructions?
No, no
Despite all my rage...
NO!  Smartratfliggenlivet is not for us!  We're Norwegian.
I don't know."
"Cheese it!"
"Mmmm... cheese.
It's subversive.
Damn, the instructions are in Swedish!
Don’t look at me, I got fired from Ikea.
Never liked mazes, how about we build a Tiny Mouse House?!
I can get through a maze, but this is just too much
Darn, the instructions are in squirrel-ese.
Looks like we’re missing the cheezie part.
I thought you ordered the maze with mirrors!
Once the maze is complete, it will lead us to the cheese-making class.
This is going to be the best World Maze Cup yet
Isn’t IKEA amazing?
Seems amazingly simple.
Trust me, they'll never know we fixed anything.
These IKEA directions are very difficult.
So much for keeping it simple. Let's text Mr. Iger, the mouse house guy.
Hey, no problem. It's pictorial instructions. Just remember how to get out.
A-MAZE-ingly easy construction.....fake news
You’d be amazed!
What gives? I thought the maze came with cheese.
How's the Irrgång coming along? Ikea doesn't assemble itself, you know.
It is not a designer pad, Horace, it is a trap
Ikea style - no mouse type!

I got it at IKEA.  Sorry they're in Swedish.
Hungry? Let's take a fika. There're meatballs in the cafe.
Did they forget to attach the mouseover tips on this manual?
'' Its harder than it looked on the add''
I'm literally amazed.
They are messing with us with the height!
You just had to buy the IKEA maze.
All I can say is, I've read them twice and I feel like one of us in a maze.
Listen....anyone can build a better mouse trap, but we've got the inside track on the better mouse maze design
If you still fancy some cheese, let's take our chances on the trap.
It's such an abstract.
These IKEA plans don’t make any sense at all.
Is this really a plan to "Build a Better Mousetrap"?
It’s Scandinavian design, unlike all these federal cuts to research
He calls the house a dump. This is his solution.
What, no meatballs?
This is nothing. My dad built a birdhouse and was a twitter sensation.
Remind me again.  Why are we building a better mousetrap?
This maze already has me lost.
You would think we could understand Ikea instructions by now.
Okay, if they expect us to build the maze that cheese better be Gouda.

Donald Potvien, Duluth, Minnesota
Mickey will be coming soon with the cheese pizza.
'Cheese not included'?  Why even bother?
Easy! First, get a cube of cheese. Then, place it in there, see? Next, reverse engineer it, eat the cube and charge admittance to find the scent of the cube.  An' maybe a crumb or two.
Brother mouse can't see, neither.
This one translates to either cheese or cheese-bait.
I'm not using a Task Rabbit
Next thing you know, they’ll have us manufacturing the syringes.
Is this your first IKEA maze?
Dammit, Christopher, you ordered a rat trap again.
It's over, Jerry.
I'm not very mechanical.
We'll teach them a thing or two about mouse clicks
A traitor drew these up. Do you smell a rat?
It's simple, either we have one large master suite or two small bedrooms.
Think outside the box, Harry.”
Jacqueline Moran, Canad
Be sure to put EXIT signs in all the necessary places.
The budget cuts for this lab suck.
Let’s take an Uber to Ikea!
What do you mean they didn't include any cheese?
I know you're addicted to them, but isn't this going a little far?
But I don’t want to build a better mousetrap
We’re missing a part; there’s no lump of cheese.
Really?  They got us a maze from IKEA?
Let’s work fast, the staff arrives in a few hours!
I bet I can do it faster.
It’s a new diet I wanted to try.
This is just conjecture, of course, but I would bet this team of neurobiologists is Swedish.
Honey, can "we" move the door?
I think we can manage this,but we'll need the cat to help with the Billy Bookcase.
Unfortunately, the cheese is sold separately.
I really hate IKEA, the catalog clearly shows cheese in this model maze...
How 'bout we just skip it and eat the cheese?
Ultimately this will lead to "Who moved my cheese" so why don't we skip the trouble of this part and avoid two clichés?
Looks lIKE An amazing job to me.
At least we don't have bird brains.
I know this all seems a bit unfair, but maybe if we build the maze and THEN get to the end, they'll let us be free this time.
Let’s fast-track the cheese lane.
I told you we shouldn't have ordered from IKEA!
Now if we build it and eat the plans, we'll be the only ones who know where the cheese is hidden.
You just had to go to Ikea, didn't you?
Ikea calls this “Maus.” I call it incomprehensible

A million mice would kill for this job.
No guarantees, but I’m pretty sure YouTube can’t bring the cheese back.
I think it's not called TaskMouse for a reason.
No maze. I say a gourmet cheese shop.
Instead, why don't we just build a roof, and keep them from putting us in these stupid experiments?
Let's build a better cat-trap.
Fine, but I'm not making my own cheese.
It's our new maze from Ikea!
Oh rats it’s an IKEA maze
I didn't see any cheese in the package, did you?
And don't forget to take the cheese out this time!
Didn’t the guy at Ikea say it came with cheese wedges included? Read the directions again.
I'm just going to set up a straight through and see how they react to that.
I still don't understand how to make this human trap.
I'll never shop at IKEA again!
Let's take five and see if the DIY cheese has ripened.

Leave it to Ikea to scrimp and not include the cheese!
I am telling you that if we build this we will be taken care of we will be taken care of forever.
Ikatea's behind this - the instructions are incomprehensible and there aren't enough screws.
We’ll get through this...
This is not a blueprint to build a cat trap!"
Joe Pitts, Washington, D
I know budgets are tight but how can they expect us to build this maze with such lousy directions?
I am ready to fix them. Are you?

Now that we know we can balance balls on our noses, let's get to work on this maze for the world's smallest aardvark. Burp! I shop at IKEA!
Do you read Chinese?
Dr. Ikea makes us build our own maze.
Okay,so Whole Foods is west of Main?
This would be so much easier if the instructions weren't in pictures
You forget the meatballs. Again.
I don’t care if it is “only IKEA and that we’re in control.” It’s still a maze and when we’re finished they’ll want to dissect us and study our brains.i

I just never realized that amazement could be planned.
Damn Ikea mazes.
It was worth the effort before the meatballs went vegan.”
If we use the nails to kill each other, we can escape this cruel experiement with our dignity.

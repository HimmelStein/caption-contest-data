Lunch is on me.
Dinner's on ME.
He’s telling his friends it’s not deep. So be patient.
Dinner’s on me tonight.
I didn't know what you were serving, so I brought white.
A back massage and then dinner. What's not to like?
Fresh? Sir, I assure you these were walking on land this morning.
I brought dinner.
It's carryout.
It’s like a good wine. You let it breathe before consuming it.
Off Coney Island. There's thousands of them.
I’m letting him sunburn a bit more, I prefer extra crispy.
Eat a guy and you'll be full. Use him as bait and we'll all be full.
I used to feel sorry for them, but this one is wearing a MAGA hat.
Once I gave him a name I didn’t have the heart to eat him.
Lucky for him this is the last thing on his bucket list.
You want the other half?
I swear, it is like the universe does not want me to stay vegan.
He has a name, Dad. It's Greg. And I love him.
He' s my emotional support animal.
When I get hungry, or he realizes I'm not a dolphin, whichever comes first!
If you liked our food delivery service, please give me 5 stars.
He’s paying an arm and a leg for the ride.
I was told we had to bring our own lunch.
I got us a politician. There is no backbone !
And I suppose you've never played with your food.
Professional courtesy....he’s a lawyer.
So we each grab a leg and make a wish.
Last time I ate one this stupid, I was sick for a week.
I'm letting him take one last selfie.
Seems only fair ,
I ate his surfboard.
Yes, I KNOW I'm holding up dinner.
He's never seen the movie
It's part of this whole shore-to-table thing.
Jump up and yell, 'I'm that goldfish you flushed!' 
And then we'll eat him."
Soon, he won't have a leg to stand on.
‘Hold off a bit. He’s bragging about being “king of the sandbar” to four guys in backwards ball caps.’
Well, that's embarrassing. How long has it been there?
This is why they think most shark attacks occur in only three feet of water.
You go ahead, Frank. SPF 30 gives me heartburn.
Oh, did you want me to pick up something for you, too?
I just can’t do it without the theme music.”
Just be patient. He’s calling his friends.
First, I gain their trust.
Another Darwin Award winner.
Trust me.  This makes it easier to get all the others into the water.
I love a well-balanced meal, don't you?
Hey, Sam, I’d like you to meet my chum.
I ordered wings but they gave me legs instead.
Found him in the shallow end of gene pool.
Fine, but walking him is your responsibility.
Luckily the dumb ones taste just as good.
He thinks I'm Flipper, who's Flipper?
Watch this. I'm going to flip it up and catch it in my mouth.
How about some help carrying the groceries?
It's Hilarious. He thinks I'm a dolphin.
He had a standing reservation for dinner.
Remember when Mom read us that story about how the fox tricked the Gingerbread Man and you said nobody could be that stupid?
I still don't see why the dolphins get such a kick out of this.
Shhh...he thinks I'm a dolphin.
Are you the one who ordered takeout?
Let’s split the Bill
So much for them having a bigger brain.
I would have eaten him, but I'm finally getting WiFi.
I’m trying to eat a more balanced diet.
Can we keep him, Mom? Please?
OK, you call it - Heads or Tails?
Shall we just split an order?
Isn't it time we told him he's adopted?
I thought he was a seal, he thought I was a surf board.
I raise my own. It’s the only way to know they’re organic.
I just think it's a bad idea to eat something this stupid.
Excuse me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Another 20 minutes and he’ll be medium rare.
The guy at the bait shop said this could get us a couple lifeguards.
Shhh! He's looking out for sharks.
You're more likely to be struck by lightning than be stepped on by a human.
I decided to go with carry out.
I'm going to be on the evening news.
wait till he finds out I'm not his surf board.
Definitely a keeper!  I'd guess about a 180 pounder.
When he says "Marco," they all say "Polo,' and then we eat.
It's from that new take-out place under the pier.
It seems rude to interrupt while he’s on the phone.
Millennials act so entitled.
Heard it’s Trump ... we could become hero’s!
I'm seventy years old and I'll play with my food if I want to.
It's a new ridesharing company I started. I call it Scuber."
He’s locally sourced, and most importantly, cage free!
Honey, I brought dinner!
Of course I’ll eat him, but in the meantime  I just love the foot massage.
He's just a decoy.
Sometimes it's just too easy.
Of all my anger management exercises, this one is the most difficult
Did you already eat yours?
Don’t bite.My back has never felt so good.
This one’s on me.
The weirdest part is that the water above me keeps randomly getting warm
He’s a rescue.
He's my therapy human.
I work for UberEats now.
Yes, I could dive, but I think surfacing would be more interesting.
He’s only just temporarily on top of the food chain.
He's a loan shark-it's a professional courtesy."
This one's a decoy.  We get the real ones when they come out to rescue it.
How did these things ever make it to the top of the food chain?
If he's gonna have kids as smart as he is, it makes more sense to release him.
Don't say anything, he just told all his friends that he's tall enough to reach the bottom.
Should we do lunch now or save it for dinner?
I'm trying to eat a balanced diet
I’m making a fortune carrying them into U.S. waters.
The doc said I needed a balanced diet.
I call it “ Surf and Turf”
Shhh.  This guy thinks I'm a service animal.
I'm headed to the potluck
He's trying to get a signal.
I’m seconds away from nipping this wildlife tourism trend in the bud.
I love the look in their eyes when they realize they're not standing on the bottom.
One lousy surfer and I get sixteen weeks of community service.
Feels so good I hate to eat him.
I am the fin beneath his things.
I can’t do anything without the soundtrack.
He was drowning. I'm just keeping him fresh until I get hungry.
Just wait till he does another hand stand.
You smell fear? All I can smell is feet.
I can't do that.  He's a lawyer.  He's one of our own.
Millennials...am I right?
This guy thinks he walks on water.
He thinks he's standing on a sand bar. I'm waiting for his wife.
I'll split him with you.
Don’t worry he’s armless
I wish I had a blowhole.
He’s all yours. I can’t stomach another old white male.
My ex got the top half.
Probably not a stable genius.
Shall we each grab a leg and make a wish?
White meat is dry and flavorless, but there's no alternative on Nantucket.
Ok, let's go over this again... I hit the brakes, then you open your mouth.
Takeout is on me tonight.
I just get more done if I bring my lunch to work.
The invitation said to bring your own lunch
It's win win. He gets a free ride, I get a free lunch.
It's a decoy.
Here's your take-out. That'll be 20 clams.
You said you wanted fresh.  I'm bringing you fresh.
You were right about President Trump, he really is the dumbest thing on land or water.
You ordered a 160 pounder, no fins, no wet suit?
I accidentally looked up his trunks... totally lost my appetite.
New gig with Uber Eats.
Beginning to have second thoughts on the Uber gig.
I can’t, he’s a client.
So who's on top of the food chain?
You know, it wouldn't kill you to help me carry the groceries.
It’s a comfort human.
Here's your order.
I REALLY hate Lent!
I’ll wait until he finishes waving at his wife.
When eating out got so expensive I started packing my lunch.
I dunno--I heard the guy say, "Less crowded than Everest and twice as safe."
I like to play with them a little beforehand. Don't tell Mom.
It's called Great White Privilege.
I know we said we weren't exchanging gifts this year, but I couldn't resist.
The most embarrassing part is he keeps calling me "Flipper".
It’s times like these that I regret going vegan.
They're all over the place. Go get your own.
I know. But he removed a thorn from my fin”.
I'm transitioning to porpoise, if you must know.
My wife said to bring someone home for dinner.
They're like muffins. The top half is delicious.
No, go ahead, you tell him
Man, this Swim With The Dolphins racket is great -- look what I got!
The kids wanted takeout again.
Let's humor him until his wife and kids arrive.
I'm not hungry right now, but it's like packing a lunch for later.
Let's wait until he's finished waving to his kids.
He's a lawyer. Professional courtesy.
Suppers on me!
Too bad today is Catch and Release
Don't show your fin! He thinks he's riding a dolphin!
I brought take out.
We have a deal.  He tells everyone else it’s safe and I don’t eat him.
Hey, Frank, dinner’s on me, today.
Say hello to my little chum.
Do you have any grey poupon?
It started as a joke, but now I'm sorta invested.
My mom finally said I could have a pet - he's a rescue.
The missus asked me to get some takeout.
Since when don't you like Italian?
I'm gonna give this Uber thing another week.
All I know is the sciatica in my caudal fin is gone completely.
He's keeping an eye out for sharks
I like the top a little crispy.
I thought you said I was supposed to bring lunch.
First, you have to give them a false sense of security.
I couldn’t finish the whole thing, so I got it to go.
Yeah it's a Great White
Of course this happens the week I go vegan
You try it ,the last one I ate tasted  just like chicken.
The water taxi costs an arm and a leg. I said I'd charge just an arm.
He's my chiropractor.
Wait 'til he finds out I'm not a dolphin.
On three?
Turns out, you can play with your food and eat it too.
You take the left leg and we’ll make a wish.
I'm sick of white meat.  YOU eat it!
Thigh or drumstick?
What is it you're not supposed to do, 30 minutes after eating a swimmer?
Oh, it's Human Week.
People keep coming to try and rescue him. I swear, I've never eaten so good in my life.
It's my emotional support human.
He ain't heavy, he's my lunch.
...and we'll have these waters to ourselves for the rest of the summer.
Oh, like you could say no to Sir David Attenborough.
And just like that, goodbye sciatica.
The trick is to brine just the bottom half
Tell the kids, dinner's ready
They are all so confident when their head is above water.
I identify as a Dolphin.
Like I told you, Karen, men will walk all over you if you let them.
Let him finish taking his selfie.
Best spa ever. Back massage followed by dinner for two.
Bait. I’m trolling for one of the really fat, juicy ones.
I’m never sure of what to bring to potlucks.
I told him I'm a dolphin.
Why don't YOU ever bring dinner?
He's my comfort human, Larry
Tastes like chicken.
Sorry I'm late. But I brought lunch.
Jump the shark? No, but he did stick the landing.
You know that trick where the dog flips a treat up off his nose and then eats it?
Ok, I am going to flip him".   Heads or Tails
Ooh gross, get it off!! Where is it?
No, maybe YOU misunderstood when he said "Help, shark!"
What can I say, he’s a lawyer. He’s one of us.
This is NOT how He walked on water.
Let's let him wave frantically to shore for another minute or two.
Uber Eats delivery for you
What is it? Get if off me! Get it off!
I was going to let him finish his text.
Have at him. I gave up men for lent.
I tried goat yoga. This is better.
He thinks they're swimming with dolphins.
Great white privilege...
You know what they say..."eat a man and you have lunch,  use one as bait and you'll feast forever"
Surf and Turf
Wanna grab a bite?
I'm on my way to a potluck.
I don’t know, I think he said his name was Spielberg and I owe him big time....
Watch this!  He thinks he’s on a sand bar.
I met him online.
I give up.  What has two legs and looks tasty for lunch?
Why don’t you bring a sea weed salad or bottle of red wine.
Does the tag say “sell by” or “use by”
No, when you're a shark, you're not necessarily a shark all the way.
Why does this always happen when I'm fasting?
He says the cell signal is better out here.
He's my chum.
I believe you ordered take-out.
I stopped for take-out on my way home.
I promise. This is his last selfie.
This has been a bad week, one Fitbit, two tires and now a stand up comedian.
I thought he'd realize his mistake and jump off, but it's been three hours and now it seems too awkward to say anything.
I'm just gonna ride this one out.
I grabbed us take-out.
I told you I was bringing the entree!
The wife is working late, so she asked me to bring home dinner.
I got some takeout from that new sand bar.
You the guy who ordered the sushi?
he thinks he found a sandbar
I got takeout tonight
'I won't eat him right away. My back feels great.'
Hurry, go get the camera.
It's low-pay, seasonal work. But it includes meals.
At the count of three, we each grab a leg and make a wish.
I feel like a Golden Retriever with a Cheerio on its nose.
The legs taste better after marinating for an hour.
It's even better than goat yoga.
It  is the final exam for self control and anger management class
I'd eat him, but he's doing wonders for my back.
Something is in the water. Oh my god, it just touched me!
Imagine how he'll spin this for his college essay.
Pretty soon this guy won't have a leg to stand on.
I have to wait for that music to start.
I know, you hate it when I play with my food...
I don’t care how much good publicity we need, this is humiliating.
Do you prefer the thigh or leg?
Do you think he knows that he's taking the last selfie of his life?
Chick bait.
It attracts the lifeguards, and they don't come any meatier than that!
I am so sick of tourist season - you can have this one.
Uber Eats
We Canadian sharks are just too polite.
When should I tell him I am not a dolphin?
I think it’s a great white.
It’s harder than goat yoga and it comes with a snack.
40 more hours of community service, and I can go back to biting ‘em.
Gives a whole new meaning to "stupid" doesn't it?
It's the only way to get that knot out of my back.
He's all yours.  I can't eat anything this stupid.
He’s just taking a selfie.  Then we can eat him.
He’s my chum, not yours.
Grab a leg, and make a wish....
Yeah, I've got your Uber Eats order.
Are you the guy who ordered dinner?
I know, but my doctor told me to just leave it alone and eventually it'll fall off.
He's not heavy. He's my lunch.
I was running late, so I got my meal to go.
It works like a charm to catch lifeguards
Tourists ...its too easy
Your Uber Eats order, sir.
Are you gonna tell him? Or should I?
He does things for me you can't begin to understand.
Take a bite and tell me if it tastes like chicken.
She can't complain it's not "fresh" this time!
It’s all about branding.  If we save one once in a while, we’ll be right up there with the dolphins
Best. Disguise. Ever.
He's picking up plastic.
It's a matter of perception vs. reality.  He thinks I am a log and I know he is my lunch.
It's a shame we have to throw them back if they are under three feet.
Revenge is a dish best served live.
The top half was delicious.
The wife likes her takeout fresh
I thought I'd get a massage in before lunch.
I like to eat a balanced diet.
I'm a comfort shark...
You go high, I'll go low.
My wife sent me for takeout.
It's take your dinner to work day.
I'm trying to quit, but they make it too damn easy."
I ate his wife.  It's the least I could do.
When I show my dorsal fin above the water they all run screaming, but with this sunburned mannequin they never see me coming.
That's Donald Trump - much, much scarier than showing my dorsal fin above the water.
You wanna tell him? Or should I?
I brought dessert.
It feels so good I just couldn't eat him.
They’re delicious, but they need air.
Can I keep him?
No, you _can't_ have the top."That's the best part.
I'm saving the rest for later
It's bring Your Victim to Work Week."
Be my guest, I can't reach him.
Whatever it is he's trying to prove, he's not going to have a leg to stand on.
Let's make a wish.
What?? Do I have something caught in my teeth?
He's out of his depth and clueless. Sad.
Don’t pretend like you’ve never seen live bait before.
Like Donald Trump, he thinks he is on solid ground.
I don't know, it's some kind of parasite.
Its Spielberg
I think it's time to show ol' Macheath here our pearly whites.
I didn't know they delivered.
I saved you the bottom half."
Care to join me for take-out ?
Are you the one who ordered from Grubhub?
Here’s your order sir!
Should you tell him or should I?
I'm taking it to the potluck.
Relax, he's just saying his goodbyes.
How do you want him- over easy?
I'd eat him but I've never had such a good massage before.
It's not how I imagined global warming either, but here we are.
What kills me is he thinks he’s the great white.
I find it makes the other swimmers more relaxed.
I picked up some take-out.
It's called "take out".
He keeps yelling “help!” Do you think there’s anything we can do for him?
I'm seriously thinking I should say something.
It's like he knows I'm fasting.
If he likes the ride, I get five stars on Kelp.
Do stupid people taste good?
What, do I have something in my teeth?
Tee hee.  He thinks I’m inflated.
I just don't feel like I command the respect I used to.
Actually, I do like working for Uber.
Took him 'to go'
I enjoy giving them a false sense of security.
I'm saving the legs for dessert.
I’m letting him marinate
So, what are you doing to improve our image?
Bite his leg off, will ya? My dorsal fin's going to sleep.
Remember, I said to pack a lunch...?
Oh my God, where is it?  On my back?  Don't kill it, just get it off me!
It’s Human Week.
I'm tired of all the hate
I don't have the heart to tell him I'm not a dolphin
let's do the old bait and switch.
He's all yours. I'm not big on white meat
I can never resist playing with my food.
I found a really good take out place right on the beach...
Business has really picked up ever since the ferry boat broke down.
They call it Extreme Paddleboarding.
I call it lunch.
He said he was going to get me featured on Shark Tank.
I try to maintain a balanced diet.
He's not heavy. He's my dinner.
He promised to fix my back. I promised not to eat him.
I don't mind. He's waving a 'Save the Sharks' poster.
Oh yeah ! The old sandbar trick, it works every time !
I got my sea legs.
My dermatologist isn't worried about it, but I want a second opinion.
I prefer standing rib, don't you?
So what? You've got ramoras.
His name is Jesus and he likes it when people think he can walk on water.
I had to do something—Dolphins are killing us in the PR department!
I got this one to go.
Meals on Fins!
I know, I know. I just don’t have the heart to tell him I’m not a dolphin.
Do you think he could balance on ONE leg?
I know we shouldn't play with our food, but this seems to help my back.
Call me Fishmael.
May I borrow your Grey Poupon?
I brought my lunch.
It's a balanced diet.
He's a lawyer. It's a professional courtesy.
And somehow this isn't the scariest platform in America.
Yep, another adrenaline junkie followed me home.
I know, never get attached to them, but this one is different.
I'm taking him out for lunch.
Want half?
I like mine golden brown on top.
The Great White suggests allowing the meat to stand just a bit prior to consumption.
What can I say - I like to play with my food.
Stick around! I am using him as bait!
I'm tired of Dolphins getting all the good press.
The worst part is, I just ate.
I can't believe I missed and ate his surfboard.  I think I need glasses.
I wanted to go somewhere nice, you're the one who said let's just get takeout!"
He's bait, you idiot!
It’s a long trip. Thought I’d carry a snack  for the road”
Yoo-hoo. My eyes are down here.
Hey! I didn't criticize you when you brought YOUR lawyer!
He's my chum or at least will be soon.
He does wonders for my spine.
He said he was a lawyer...professional courtesy.
I’ve just about had it with being his companion animal.
I bet this idiot thinks he's on top of the food chain right now?
I always like to bring a snack.
Look what followed me home.
I don’t eat white meat.
They're so tame these days. It's no fun anymore.
I thought it was potluck.
Be patient. He just asked his wife to come in - 
there'll be plenty for both of us.
I just can't bear to tell him he's really in over his head.
If we don't nip this in the bud, sharkboardng may become a 'thing'.
No, papa, I love him!
We decided to try that new carry out place.
No you can’t have him.  I’m delivering for GrubHub.
I owe him, He pulled a hook out of my tail years ago
What? It's Take Your Prey to Work day.
The dolphin noises worked."
Do these make my neck look fat?
No, I wouldn't say I let people "walk all over me"
You don't feel like cooking, so I got some take-out.
Did you order the take-out?
I’m swimming for the new ride-sharing app  Scuber”
When I'm through with him, he won't have a leg to stand on.
He thinks I'm a dolphin. What should I do?
He hasn't yet noticed I ate his surfboard.
I had the top half for breakfast.
No, he's just my massage therapist.
I brought a snack in case we get hungry later.
It's just until he finishes his beer.
I''m saving the bottom half until later
Professional courtesy. He's a politician.
I know. But it supposedly cures hiccups.
Here’s one guy who’s gonna be defeeted.
He's heavy...and he ain't my brother.
Do I LOOK like a dolphin?
I was going to eat him, but this massage feels fantastic.
Meet my new chum!
Carryout.
I could only eat half!
I'd eat him, but I like the back rub.
I'm with Uber. If they don't tip, I eat them.
I'm still a man eater. Uber is just a side hustle.
Fine then, you tell me how to accessorize.
I've seen better legs on a hermit crab.
Watch me flip him in the air and catch him in my mouth
I've literally got lunch on my mind
i come bearing gifts
White people, amiright?
Do you want to surprise him or should I?
I saved this one for you. I'm already stuffed to the gills.
When do you think we should let him know?
I don't have the heart to tell him I'm not a sandbar.
The odds of this occurring are roughly the same as getting struck by lightning.
It's a symbiotic relationship.  He gets a free ride, and I get to swim close to shore undetected.
I'm beginning to rethink this ride sharing gig.
Quick, take a photo for my Instagram!
It's called 'delayed gratification training.'
So, should I tell him, or do you want to?
He's a lawyer- it's just professional courtesy
What was I supposed to do? Let him drown?
I WAS GOING TO EAT HIM BUT MY BACK NEVER FELT BETTER
I switched to using live bait
I always carry a snack with me when I’m out and about.
It's just easier to carry your lunch.
Surf for him--turf for me.
I gave up eating idiots for Lent.
I still play with my food — so what?
Just stay calm - it’s more afraid of you than you are of it.
Somehow  he thinks I'm taking him back to his surfboard.
It's strickly business. For luring them over to me, he keeps any jewelry and cash.
What he doesn't know is about to hurt him.
These new lures are a hit.
It was developed by the same people who came up with goat yoga.
Dinner’s almost ready - just letting it rest for a few minutes
Don't knock it. This lure works much better than a bare fin.
What?  He's my emotional support human.
You could've at least brought dessert.
He says we can’t close until your lawyer is here too.
It's a balanced breakfast.
I don’t have the heart to tell him he’s not swimming with dolphins.
I just don't know if I really want to eat him or if it's because society wants me to"
Mom, I'm not going to be ashamed of who I love anymore.
There are days  I wish I never would have  gotten involved with Uber!
I thought I’d  do carry out this evening.
Do I have some food on my fin?
Some moron ate his surfboard
I didn’t invite him. I thought you did.
And he's eating a tuna fish sandwich
I’m full. You want him?
Sometimes, I feel like they just don't respect me anymore.
It looks like it's white meat for dinner. Do you prefer the leg or the thigh?
The top half was pretty tasty.
I'm taking my lunch to work today.
I do one National Geographic Special and he's been following me around ever since.
I'd eat him but I don't want to ruin my rideshare rating.
Ready?
Today's beach buffet is standing room only.
It's complicated.
No, no. On Fridays we can eat meat...
Fear is a tenderizer.
I named him Finn.
What would Darwin do?
It's my spirit animal.
I bought it on sale, it was Half Off.
My body, my choice.
It's a good decoy, but the glue gives me hives.
I decided to get carry-out from the beach.
My chiropractor said it’s good for my aching cartilage.
Would you get this guy off my back?
I'd eat him but he's such a stand up guy.
Since when are you concerned about sustainability?
It's a great decoy. . .works like charm every time!
I told you they'd try to domesticate us next.
Don't say a word. I'm trying not to laugh.
I know you're not supposed to play with your food, but I can't help myself.
He's endangered.
Wanna split it?
It lulls them into a false sense of security.
The recipe calls for fifteen minutes of brining.
It's a new game called 'Survival of the Idiot.'
He's just some guy from Helsinki. Calls himself a dorsal Finn.
Wanna join me for lunch?
Normally I'd eat him, but this just feels sooo good.
I picked up dinner
Want to help me ruin the summer tourist season?
I carry him with me in case my blood sugar drops and I have to eat something quick.
Of course I bring my own lunch.
I'm a Scuber driver.
I had him stuffed and mounted as a trophy.
It's the least I could do since I ate his surfboard .
I just like the top part.
I want to tell him "a little to the left" but I'm afraid he'll freak out.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do regret going Vegan.
I'm taking home the leftovers.
Shh! He thinks I'm a sandbar. Don't spoil the surprise.
I can’t, it’s too easy.
He says his name's Jonah
We do have a standing date for lunch, don't we?
Help yourself. I'm vegan.
Am I losing my edge, Alan?
They taste terrible but you should see the look on their faces when they find out I’m not a rock
I know, right? Second day as a vegan and already I'm being tempted.
Here is your carry out
I'm looking for some fava beans and a nice chianti.
I really don't like white meat.
I think my vegan diet days are just about over.
Well, the sharks in Japan say it helps with their back pain.
Pardon me. Would you have any Grey Poupon?
Let him take a few selfies first.
He thinks I’m a dolphin.
What, do I have food all over my face?
WAY too skinny for me. 
You want him?
I’m sorry I am late but I picked up dinner on the way home.
If you wanted a fresh packed lunch Morty you should have brought one.

It just started out as a barnacle....
She's a lawyer, so it's a professional courtesy on my part.

We actually get along ok; he's a lawyer.
Do you prefer the leg or thigh?
I broke his surfboard, it's the least I could do.

How was the top half?
It was either him . . .  or a tracking collar!
It's my emotional support prey.

You want the leg or the breast?
It's the eagle holding his upper body upright who I feel sorry for.
I’m saving half my snack for later.
I like the skin nice and crispy.
Suddenly, he's not half the man he used to be, oh yesterday came suddenly.

Let's flip him for it.
I got carryout.
You wanna hear the punchline or are you going to keep interrupting me?
"You want half?"
I swear, if he calls me Flipper one more time...
Sometimes I pity their naiveté.
In the mood for a slider?
Uber Eats.....what can I say, it's a living!
He's an attorney and my mentor.
What happened to yours?
If he gives me less than four stars I'm going to eat him.
It's my new "Meat, Greet, and Eat service."
He promised me a cut when they come watch him walk on water.
No, sorry.  I'm saving this half for later.

He's so asking for it.
You forgot to pack a lunch?
Do you want to tell him?
I had to give him a minute because he wants a selfie.
I don't know if I should eat him or enjoy the back massage.
Nothing quite like a foot massage and then dinner.

He's not just a friend, he's my best chum.
Free fish or not, if this crowd sings BABY SHARK one more time...
Ironically, he's a shark spotter.
Freeloader.
I'm brown bagging it today.
Doesn’t he hear the music?
You take the left, I'll take the right
I know we said we weren't going to eat any humans this summer but if he starts to pee I'm gonna lose it...
I decided to pack a lunch today.
I know, I know... I’m going to the dermatologist to get it checked out.

What? Do I have a booger or something?
One trip to SeaWorld and you think you're a dolphin.
Not a fan of legs and thighs, you?
Should I tell him?
My psychiatrist recommended exposure therapy to combat my compulsive overeating.
A little nip on the ankle should get him off my back.
I’m waiting until he drops the child
And they wonder why we attack.
And after the massage, there'll be a full course meal.
So I thought Why not take-out tonight ?
Look, man, depression has hit me hard. I just don't have the energy anymore to even bite.
I just feel like my food choices are weighing me down
But he's the only one who's ever made me happy!
It's just the old bait and switch.
You eat yet?
Yeah, but if I don't deliver it in 30 minutes or less, it's free.
Oh, him? I just signed up to be a Lyft driver.

I'll hold off on attacking until after he posts on Instagram.
There’s gotta be, like, a million things I could do to this idiot to get on “Shark Week.”
It's bring your lunch to school day.
The guy at the store said you need to keep the head as dry as possible, but I just know I'm going to forget.
I'm not hungry, but this guy deserves to die.

Should I break it to him?
I can’t break his heart, he thinks I’m a dolphin.
Okay, Okay, Okay...I am a humanitarian...Is there a problem?
You just move like a surfboard until your hungry.
It’s not what it looks like - I’m taking him to lunch.
Heads or tails?
He doesn't know he's in over his head.
Join the aquarium they said,
It'll be fun they said
Yeah, I’m embarassed, but it feels so good.
I hate 'Shark Week'
Luckily for me, Uber's driver background checks are rather lax.
You’ve got to be kidding. A great white?
Here comes the triple flip. I'm going for a vertical entry with this one.
I just let him think we have a ‘special  bond’ then I’ll eat him.
He's giving a speech on how sharks keep oceans clean. Professionally, I'm on the horns of a dilemma.
Hey Sal, Do I have food on my head?
Say when
it's only my second week, but I'm already finding it really hard to be vegan
The salesman said it would be less conspicuous than a fin.
Let’s wait til he finishes his cigarette.
I saved you the legs.
I stopped by the shore on my way home.  Thought you might like this.
Technically, we would remain vegan because he was.
Don’t tell him!
It's working, Ralph. He's telling everyone to come out and stand on this sandbar !
On the other hand, my back has never felt better.
The dolphins told me this would be fun.
Where have you been? Dinner's ready.
Don't attack him, the foot massage feels great.
They're much more comfortable approaching since I got the doll.
Open real wide now. When I go low, you go high!
I know, honey, I know. But, we have just got to watch the carbs.
Trust me, it'll be funnier AFTER he realizes...
Professional courtesy. We might need a good lawyer some day.
I know you hate talking about dinner plans when we’ve just had lunch...
Well I'm hungry, too, but this really gets the kinks out of my back.

I'm waiting for a seal, they have more meat on them !!
His feet stink like the Bronx so maybe he tastes good, too.
It's today's special. Surf & Turf.
What?! You have a problem with carry-out?
He wants to impress some woman. We all know how that is.
We have to throw it back. It's under the weight allowance.
His arms were delicious but I had to save the rest for later.
Of course we’ll eat him, but let him adjust my spine first
His surf, our turf.
Poor guy thinks he’s walking on water... at least he’ll go out in style.
You should start packing a lunch too.
I can't shake him.  How did you get rid of yours?
I'm emotionally attached because years ago when I was really hungry  he gave me a hand.
An hour a week and the back’s good as new.
I’m waiting for him to get off his phone.
There is no other half.
I'm a breast man myself. Do you want a leg?
Fast food to go!
And now, what the hell do I do?
Zero respect since Jaws.
Normally I would, but it actually feels very good.
Going vegan is much more annoying than I thought it would be.
Since  I hired him to be my lookout, I’ve  stopped scaring the swimmers away.
It's like Uber Eats only quicker.
What he doesn't know if, after the massage, I get a happy ending.
what?
Allow me to cull this one from the herd.
I like foot massages.
First a massage, then dinner.
I use him as my look out - the fin thing is just too much of a give-away.
No! You ate the top half!
I want to eat him, but then I'll have to wait 30 minutes until I can go swimming.
Are you interested in the leftovers?
It's a human decoy I made.  Everyone thinks it's safe and pile into the water and then we feast.
It's customary to tip for your grubhub delivery
Grab one and make a wish.
Don't eat my emotional support animal!

He thinks he's my surf buddy, but he's just chum.
You know you can just eat him, right?
See? They are not all blood-thirsty monsters.
He’s not using me, our love is real.

I don’t know, I guess I’m just not that hungry.
I do this for an arm and a leg.

It's just a snack for later. It won't "ruin my dinner," mom.
There is a $10 delivery fee
I like a massage before my meal.
I packed a lunch today, it's cheaper than eating out.
Works such a drag, I just can’t get this guy off my back!
I've tried everything.  I have an appointment with my dermatologest next week to have it removed
What do you say we see how he hangs five?
How did they ever dominate the world when they are not that bright!
I say it's a 60% - 40% split since he is standing on me!
Yeah, it's great, I make my own hours and eat on the job!
I'll consume him in due time. Finish your story.
Mate, you've still got a bit of food on you...
You should see him from the waist up.
I'm just keeping him fresh for dinner when I get hungry.
He thinks I'm sandbar, and now I don't have the heart.
He complained about the rate so I told him I'd take half off.
matter of fact, no, i’m a man-standing shark.
Today's special is the Surf and Turf
Bait. The fin was a dead giveaway.
Yeah, my wife made me take a lunch today.
Just wait until he finds out I'm not a dolphin.
I'd feel guitly eating someone so stupid.
More effective than hot rocks and tastes better too.
Uber shark food delivery ... here's your order.
They do takeout.
They said 'Don't go near shore' . Did I listen - Nooo…
Trying to convince his friends it’s only 3 feet deep.
It's symbiotic.  He gets chicks, and I eat them.
I told him he should just jump the shark already but, he didn't get it.
We have a standing dinner date.
Watch this.
He’s gonna be surprised when he finds out I’m not Shamu.
It's one of my best lures.
Give him a break. The guy lost his surfboard.
Drumstick?
Once again, looks like you got more of it on you than in you.
Professional respect...he's a lawyer.
I disagree. I think this ride shark service could habe some legs to it.
You have Chip on your shoulder.
I just remembered why we never stop swimming.
Its a symbiotic relationship, he gets to swim without getting tired and I get to eat him when he's done.
Its an exercise in delaying gratification
You can start with the drumsticks
I am trying to make him feel what it’s like to be endangered.”
I'm starting a balanced diet today.
Out of the Way! He is one of us,  Binsky just passed the Bar.
Hey, Dad.  He followed me home.  Can I keep him?
Wait'll you see his face when he realizes he's not on a rock.
It's take-out tonight.  End of discussion.
Word is, Sharkworld may raise our pay to $15 per hour, plus chum.
I might be hungry later.
They say if I stop swimming he’ll die.

I said I’d split it with you...
Uber Eats delivery.
I'm full. I'm taking this half home for the wife.
I brought you leftovers...
Snacks on me!
Bad hair day
What really irks me is that if our positions were reversed, they'd harpoon my ass.
Make all the fun you want—my chiropractor said it'll help!
He's doing something called "selfie?"
I'm carrying 125 pounds in the finals of the handicapped shark races. How about you?
Do you ever feel like “the man” is always on your back?
They call it shark-surfing. Want to help teach him a lesson?
This idiot thinks I am his surf board.
What did you do with yours?
I can’t remember if I’m supposed to stop swimming, play dead or rap him on the nose.
Why can't I play with my food?
You go ahead.  I'd prefer some finger food.
We met on a fetish site.
I've lost my edge!
It's my first time as an Uber driver, but if I get humgry it's all over.
I'm making extra money as a uber driver.
I met him in my “Vegan for Dummies” cooking class.
I find them really useful as bait.
Can you finish the rest?  I just wanted the wings and breast.
It started out as a wart on my dorsal.
I would, but his arm only got one star on Yelp.
Sorry, I can't go out to lunch today.  I brought leftovers.
I think you should know that this guy has a spear gun pointed at you and perhaps you should take a swim back to your own waters .
I thought you said to pack a lunch?
I got us takeout.
I'll tolerate him for a while since he thinks he is swimming with the dolphins.  Then I'll grab a leg.  Want the other?
I'm not hungry. Are you?
As above, so below.
Call PR...aren’t they supposed to be scared of us!
My ad was supposed to say ‘Wanted: Sucker Fish’, but in print it got cut off...
I lost a bet to a vulture. He gets to go first.
It's either this or pain pills.
Why don't they ever talk about our good qualities?
Some situations really test my decision to go vegan.
I swim carefully, but they rarely give me five stars.
I wish he'd stuck with goat yoga.
It's times like this that really make me regret going vegan.
On the count of 3...
Here's your Uber Eats Delivery"
My generation always swam against the current in freezing water to hunt for food. Your soft generation lays around in globally-warmed water waiting for delivery.
"Your delivery of a gluten-free person for dinner."
I brought the hors d'oeuvre.
He said he was a lawyer, so I knew he was one of us.
When do you think I should tell him?
I always bring a snack.
I’m working on a balanced diet.
That top half was filling. I'm saving these leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast.
If anything, it's a conflict of interest.
The vet said I have to start lifting weights.
No, I know he's there, but sometimes I just want to have to work for it.
I just know I’m going to get Athlete’s Fin from this.”
He thinks he's standing in shallow water.
Tell me the truth: have I gained weight?
He's my attorney
Something like this happens every time I try to quit.
He said he needs to finish tweeting first.
It was either this or the chiropractor.
As a support shark I get into the movies for free.
I'm about to give him a fish pedicure he won't ever forget.
I told you we look like surfboards
Just in case I get hungry later.
My PR team thought it would help soften my image.
Talk about a false sense of security!
I've become a bottom feeder.
Yeah, I prefer wings.
I know I look funny but you wouldn't believe the reception.
Now I have athlete's fin
It's rebranding - folks were starting to have a negative association with the fin.
Trust me, it’s a great way to lure the others.
I still don't get why my folks told me not to play with my food.
I'd take his legs off, but he's scratching a spot I can't reach.
Did you enjoy the top half?
It really helps my back!
I'm not hungry, but I don't think I can pass up the teachable moment.
I used to think "When your a shark you're a shark all the way", but now I dunno
I'm his emotional support shark. Really.
I don’t know how much longer I can take working under this guy!
If he shouts 'Hey, Bro!--Who's the Man!' one more time, let's snap him in half!
I can’t stand this anymore, and they wonder why we bite them from time to time !
Let one swimmer go and they walk all over you!
Goat yoga is so passé
Nah, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel.
It's a new ride share program called SCUBER.
Actually, I think I prefer Rolfing.
He's soooo worth it when I get an itchy fin.
He thinks he's standing on the bottom.  We can dine when the others arrive.
I'm not holding him up, he thinks he's holding me down.
When you said "meet me at noon" I didn't realize it was for lunch.
Yes, he's adopted. How did you know?
It’s called shark boarding but it isn’t catching on.
I feel like I forgot something...
I stopped biting people after my cardiologist suggested a plant-based diet.
You can have the first bite.
I told you meeting Aquaman would be a disappointment.
Its something called ride sharing.
My therapist says I need to be less reactive.
He Is Heavy, He Ain’t My Brother.
Eat this guy, will ya.  I can't shake him.
Dude gives me a back massage and I don’t eat him, fair deal?
White privilege, need I say more?
I don't have the heart to tell the guy that he's no longer standing on a sandbar.
I picked up dinner on the way home.
I ate his surfboard. Now what?
When did you get that 4th gill?
I brought home takeout.
Back off -- where are we gonna find another chiropractor?
I have to digest his surfboard before I eat him.
We won the surfing contest.
After he  gives me shiatsu, I'm giving him a pedicure.
They’re endangered
One lousy surfer and I get 300 hours of community service.
Ok fine, as long as it won’t spoil your dinner.
He's the best ashiatsu massage therapist outside of Cancun.
This guy just won't get off my back - can you give him a scare?
It's okay. I appreciate not being stereotyped.
You wanted the lower torso, right?
Shorts week
If I move, do you think he’ll yell SHARK?
Do you think it’s malignant?
I’m stuffed. Would you like the other half?
I carry my lunch.
I'm doing this for Lent.
I told him that if he doesn’t get off my back, I’m going to eat him.  But I didn’t tell him that I’m going to him anyway.
I ate the last two, so the resort put me on probation.
He’s afraid of water over his head.  Sharks, not so much.
I'm bringing the food. Did you get the drinks?
Let him finish his text.
He works on my back and I don't eat him.
Hungry? I just ate his other half.
I suppose he thinks I'm a dolphin.
It was a typo-the email said “shark attach”.
In the good old days, it was an albatross around the neck.
On 3. 1...2...
I don’t get it.  This massage thing is just not what it’s cracked up to be.
I type feet porn in to google ONE TIME and now I get this everyday.
The lack of respect for the environment is getting out of control
Please tell me it's lunchtime.
He's all yours... I am a "breast guy" !
Leftovers. Why do you ask?
I don’t have the heart to tell him.
The legs are enticing, but the massage is incredible.
Da dumb, da dumb, da dumb
He loves the ocean, but he can't swim.
I like to play with my food before eating it.
He thinks I'm a sandbar and it would be awkward to move now.
Will you get this guy off my back please?
This intermittent fasting is killing me.
That's the deal: I let him take a selfie surfing a shark, and he lets me eat him with no fuss
Would you care to share my appetizer"?
Cirque de Soleil. Avoid 'em--it's like chewing on a broomstick.
One leg, his Instagram goes viral, and I'm the bad guy.
Have you met Finn?
Wow, the odds of being stepped on by a human is a million to one, we should play powerball this week.
I know you told me not to give it a name...
If he calls me Flipper one more time...
Don’t judge me. I think we can make this relationship work.
I hope he will attract a plumper one.
Predatory lending? I’m only charging 10% interest to keep this guy afloat.
He’s already booked me for Shark Week. And, he thinks I could be the next Jaws! So no you may not eat him.
Don't knock it. It's the best fishing lure I've ever used
I Think I'm A Vegan.
I think it's some kind of remora.  See if you can scrape it off me.
It's my new diet.  You have to balance your food.
I'll take this half to go
His chiropractic technique is simply delicious!
I promised once more around before we eat him.
He's a cousin of ours - a loan shark.
I could be here a while. He’s reading the Mueller Report.
One more lawyer joke and he’s toast.
The surfboard was very filling.
A lot has changed since I became a vegetarian.
I've really lost the urge since I  can't hear the theme music.
How long have you been an Uber Shark?
Yeah, I'm doing a gig now for Uber Eats.
I didn't believe in chiropractors either.
I'm saving this half for brunch.
The worst part is that he keeps repeating that ridiculous song.
It's supposed to be like goat yoga.
They call it shark pilates.
It's just easier than carrying a lunch sack.
I’ve taken a job with Lyft!
No kidding? I've never tried shiatsu.
I'd say it's a fair exchange--he scratches my back and I don't eat him.
I hate this diet...
Swimming with the sharks, he calls it. To think I left a good job at Sea World for this.
It's how big? That's odd because it feels more like two feet to me.
AND TODAY'S SPECIAL APPETIZER,,HOMME.
I have to replace the board I damaged
Can you hear his accent?   I think we’re somewhere on Oklahoma.
I didn’t have a choice - I ate his surfboard!
It was either this or goat yoga.
If this doesn’t get us on the caption contest, I don’t know what will.
He’s telling everyone that he’s a standup comic. Is there such a thing?
It is proprietary. I think this idea has legs.
What about you? Ever wanted to try paddle boarding?
Tell them you're a vegetarian and they think they can walk all over you.
Why does stupid taste so good?
What odd growth? I don’t feel anything.
I thought we'd get take out and watch a movie.
I ordered it to go.
Just toying with him before my dinner
He thinks I am an Uber
I just picked up dinner.
Since I started seeing him three times a week, my neck is 100% better.
Look...I did not go vegan because it was going to be easy, Walter!
I just don't have the heart to tell him he's in too deep.
This will keep it fresh until we get home and eat.
He thinks he's safe on a rock; I'm saving him for our family frenzy at suppertime.
Yeah, it's kinda like uber.
Sometimes you  get  exactly what  you  wish  for.
Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all: 'I hear you should always eat a balanced diet'; 'It's good to support your food choices; or 'He's a lawyer; professional courtesy'... Let's hope the winning entry is more original!
Okay, yes I'm using a decoy. Some of us are not as fast as we used to be.
Shark surfing, apparently it's a thing.
Ok, stop messing with me . You seriously don’t see anything at all on my back?  I sure as heck feel something
It’s leftovers, I ate the other half last night.
He wants me to swim near the surface so he can impress some chick Mary Magdalene...
And you get a snack after the back rub.
It's a long story.
When I'm through playing, would you like breast or thigh?
I know, but he satisfies an itch.
It keeps calling me "Dude".
This is why I don't come to New York anymore, it's just not a challenge here.
Get ready.  These decoys really draw them in.
How do I get this monkey off my back?
I find it much more convenient to pack a lunch.
Some fins wrong. 
I'm just not sure what.
I had to go and attack a damn lawyer!
He thinks he is standing on the bottom.  Watch this!
Do you want to join me for dinner?
The ones trying to swim with us are a little more satisfying. 
Less fat, more filling.
If you don’t tell him, I won’t tell him.
When did this become a "thing"?
He thinks he’s swimming with dolphins.
No thanks I have my own lunch.
Market price is $8.99/lb.
Yes, Steve, I do know this looks bad, and no, I do not have a plan to resolve this amicably.
It's all I can get after that Katy Perry gig.
It's called  Ashiatsu and don't you dare ruin this for me !
It's Hemingway's great grandson.
Some days being a vegan is harder than others.
I knew I it was a mistake to go Vegan.
They get a tad mealy if you just let 'em drown.
Wanna see me flip him into my mouth whole? The look of fear and surprise is delightful.
Does this thing make my dorsal fin look weird?
But I did get the better half!
I'm his Uber diver.
And the bottom half makes a one-of-a-kind hat.
Your order is here.
This all started with those @#&* dolphins.
Standing room only.
It just pee`d on me. 
What do I do?
WHAT DO I DO?!
And I  had to pick this week to go vegan!
When do we let him know he's not standing on a rock?
This joker thinks he’s standing on a sandbar!  Ya hungry?
I'd eat him except he has our cell phone.
I have a family to feed.
I had the top half for lunch, the bottom half I'm saving for supper.
Who’s gonna tell him?
We're here for the Bar Association annual meeting.  How about you?
I told you not to eat that surfboard
Legs or thighs?
It's called "delayed gratification".
Should I let him finish his hot dog first?
I'm just not into him
These millennial snorkelers are awfully entitled.
Packing my own lunch is a chore, but nothing beats eating locals.
Well, Darren, maybe this is my happy place.
I owe him. I ate his ex-wife.
On the count of three, let’s grab lunch.
No, he's the one who needs a bigger boat.
I'm saving it for a snack attack.
I just couldn't. It's Bobby Darin.
This guy figures he's a shoo-in for the 2019 Darwin Award.
It's BYOB, right?
It's symbiotic, he's promised not to turn my fins into soup.
He keeps calling me Flipper. I'm playing along until lunchtime.
He said his name is Fonzie and he's just doing it for the ratings.
Says he's a shark spotter
Did you order Grubhub?
You know the one about the scorpion and the frog?
I think of it as the massage lunch package.
Airbnb. The wife's idea.
It’s an Uber pilot program.
I hate the gig economy.
He’s right on top of me, isn’t he?
You’re holding up dinner.
Dinner is served Madam.
Got drunk, lost a bet, its hell...
Yes, Modell, I am going to eat it. If you want a piece, just ask!
I think he’s got a career in stand-up.
I’m working on my instant gratification issues
I just hate those skinny bones stuck in my throat.
I thought I’d try an edible back massager
His feet feel really nice on my back, but I also want to eat him.
Ah, ha, ha, I fooled you!   This is the bottom half of the guy I bit in two off Florida!
Lenny, you do realize they can see through the tank... right?
Yeah, I'm hungry... but where's the sport in it?
port-a-snack
He knows it's dangerous, but sometimes the only way to keep your head above water is a loan shark.
Will you judge me if I drop him?
I call it lifeguard bating.
Please don't eat him. My back has never felt so good.
Yes, I am saving it for later.
I joined Uber's new water program. If I don't get five stars, I eat him.
You've heard of the marshmallow test?  If I wait, a second one will come along and I can eat both of them.
I’d dump him, but turns out he does wonders for my sciatica.
Who takes "Jumping the shark" literally?
I'm rethinking this Uber gig.
“I know it’s a mannequin. I’m fishing for lifeguards.”
Can we get fined for chumming?
I ate his paddle board by mistake and now I feel sorry for him.
If I don't carry a snack for the kids I can't even get them out of the bay
Not happy about this gig economy I find myself in.
Marco?
It's an eatable back scratcher"
Half a billion years old and the planet’s most vicious predator - where’s the respect?
I just like the way it feels, okay ?
Looks like someone is getting excited for People Week...
If I hear "nice hat!" one more time...
I ordered Uber eats and got Uber lift instead.
Go ahead, I had a late lunch.
If he thinks he’s on a surfboard, he’s in for a big surprise!!
Compliments of the Chef
Because they taste better when they're really fresh.
Be honest, is the hat too much?
I thought you said it was a potluck.
I'm evolving.
Hungry for some surf 'n' turf?
Can I get back with you? I'm going to lunch.
Time to let him know I'm not a dolphin.
My nutritionist told me I needed to balance my diet
He's free-range, humanely raised, and non-GMO.
I told you that it was all over when they started with that swimming with the dolphins thing.
My shrink is calling it "exposure therapy".
It's symbiotic for now. I'm not making any promises.
He's heavy, but he's a great decoy.
I like to start with a false sense of security!
Do you want to break it to him...or should I?
I eat anyone who gives me less than four stars.
I think can we can take the mixed doubles water ballet title, if I can control my appetite.
Some of these guys, it's like they don't even want to be eaten!
It's only humiliating if you don't eat him afterwards.
Dibs on the crunchy part.
Last client of the day.
I hate it when lawyers go on vacation and think they’re one of us.
He made a bet that he could walk on water. I get a cut if he wins.
They pee on us every day and then wonder why we’re so mean.
My headache's gone.
We made a deal.....I get a back rub, and he gets to live.
This one's O.K. The last guy was wearing cleats.
Did you order takeout?
I think they’re taking this “apex predator” thing a little too far.
We make a wish, and then we each grab an end…
Here you go. Thanks for calling GrubHub.
I know, but they're even more delicious if they bake in the sun for a few minutes until they're well done.
I'm just giving him a lift before I have a bite to eat.
When I go low, you go high.
I’ve found that strapping a lawyer on my back scares more swimmers than my fin alone.
I have to swim constantly anyway, so really the new gig economy is working for me.
Say what you will about chiropractors...
There's this great new takeout place down the coast.
I’m a pacifist.
He tells everyone he's the "great white one".
Please don't eat my massage therapist!
You can Venmo me for your half.
When should we tell him that he's not on a sandbar?
Tell me I’m not hallucinating.
I am bringing supper over to the new shark family that just moved in across the bay
No, I haven't seen Jaws. Why do you ask?
So what are YOU bringing to Terry's pot-luck dinner?
I had just eaten and he asked me nicely.
Welcome to Sea World. It will all make sense after a while.
Do you prefer him over easy or sunny-side up?
I'm saving this half for lunch tomorrow.
He thinks he's on a sandbar. Watch me introduce some sharp shells.
You ordered, lunch?
Hey honey, there was too much to eat at the party so I brought you some leftovers.
Welcome to Sea World.
Some guy named Steven Spielberg.
I'm not very hungry.
Yes I’m giving him a ride. You’ve never heard of SCUBER?
He insists; just because I ate his surfboard by mistake.
Humans, always looking out for danger when it's right under their feet.
Please tell me you like white meat.
If you think this looks bad, stick your head up and get a look at the other half
Don’t go near the beach!
They call it shark surfing.  I call it playing with my food.
he's telling them all to come on in, I'm serving in 5 minutes.
Call it! Heads or tails?
No one told me becoming vegan would lead to this!
I can't.  We've bonded.
I was saving him for later, but I'm hungry now.  Want a bite?
I know it’s a cliché, but yes, he’s a lawyer.
It’s the takeout half off meal deal.
I signed on with Uber.
I know what it looks like, but it’s been great for my back pain!
Play it cool. It's for his PETA campaign against Shark fin soup.
This guy better give me five stars.
Get ready.  I heard him call out "C'mon everybody.  The water feels great!"
Catch up, dude. The fin thing is a dead give away.
I know, but he's nice and I'm so done with being dangerous.
Global warming is bringing them out earlier in the season.
I hear it’s good for your core.
I was full; I'm planning to finish it later on.
It’s too easy!
Yep, another hitchhiker. He thinks I'm taking him to Hawaii. Dinner at 7?"

Sunil Mahtani, Westport, CT
sm@kingfisherinvestors.co
He failed to jump the shark.
You ordered the ‘Businessman Express’ lunch, Sir?
I'm picking up  a few extra bucks working for Uber.
So, I get this sonar call, I show up at some spot, someone climbs aboard and off we go.
I’d eat this guy, but I’m still full from  those plastic bags.
No, I'm on this 30 day cleanse now.
Do me a favor and eat this guy off my back
It's the least I could offer after eating his surfboard.
Do me a favor and bite his leg.
Hey, honey. Want to split a dessert?
Professional courtesy. He’s a member of the bar.
Bringing lunch from home for a change.
I know this looks bad, but I'm just not hungry, okay?
I got a summer job as a surfboard.
Once you get past the temptation, it's actually really good for your core.
So... What do you think?  Should we get him now or save him for later?
I'm so full. Do you want the bottom half?
I might as well come out and admit it. I feel that I 'm a dolphin.
I was going to eat him but my back is really feeling the benefit.
I'm only eating locally sourced. This guy was flown in from DesMoines."
I'm stuffed. You want leftovers?
If you don’t attack first, they think they can just walk all over you.
If I stop swimming his shorts fall down.
He's not heavy. He's my brother up the food chain.
Thanks,but I brought my lunch today.
You know what’s been on my mind lately?
Great Meal Aboard"
Your delivery of a gluten free dinner
He’s my emotional support pet, or if that doesn’t help, a midday snack.
Another consequence of global warming:  a dorsal Finn.
His Uber rating is a 4.7
I've got the entree"
I am beginning to rethink this Uber gig.
You'll have to talk to the man upstairs.
"The dolphin mask worked like a charm."
Don't judge me, bro... everyone's side gig is Uber
He doesn’t understand what jumping the shark really means!
I was told to bring lunch.
No, Frank, you can't "borrow" my emotional support animal.
I hope you don't mind, we're having take-out tonight.
He likes a cigarette after we have sex.
First I must gain his trust.
They think he's standing on a sandbar.
Hold still. The wife is meatier.
Wanna a Bite?
It’s less conspicuous than when my dorsal fin sticks out of the water.
He's too skinny.  I'm taking him back to shore."
Michael Rogness, St. Paul, MN
Lawyers are taking this professional-courtesy thing to a whole other level."
Grab the other leg and let's make a wish.
A balanced diet is always best!
It's either this or extinction.
They`re featuring me in a nature film - "When Fish Had Feet".
I'm playing a long game.
I feel sorry for him, he can't swim!
I call it Farm-to-table.
Heads he's mine. Tails he's yours.
I'm saving him for dinner.
What? Do I have food on my face?
Make a wish.
Are you sick of white meat?
Better than any pilot fish.  He's a professional pilot.
Dinner, ma'am , freshly served.
Here's your dinner dear.
 You did say you wanted white meat meat, right?
This one is yours, the last one gave me heartburn.
I’m more of a leg and butt shark.
Give these humans an inch and they walk all over you.
I only eat them if they don’t tip.
He ain't heavy he's my dinner.
So then he looks at his cellphone and says, "You must be my Uber Fish."
Why do I always have to carry the decoy?
I picked up lunch for you
That disguise is not going to fool any of the swimmers, Sal.
You had to choose NOW to suggest that we become Pescatarians?!
Where the hell have you been? My shift's been over for 5 minutes.
He thinks I'm a rock.  I'm just holding him here until I get hungry.
Are you hungry for schmuck?
I’m lulling him into a false sense of security.
Feels like remora, tastes like chicken.
Why don’t you tell him I’m not a 
sand bar
I’ve had it up my neck with bloody tourists!
Would you like fries with that?
I could only eat half of it. Just wasn’t that hungry.
I hate being vegan....
It feels so good when he wiggles his toes.
I found him first.
These days you just look at an endangered species and The Man will be ridin’ your back for years”
It's the latest thing in evolution - my own decoy!
Of course he's an attorney.
Manna from heaven.
He’s starting to piss me off.
Morty, be honest.... does this pair of human legs make me look fat?
For once I'd like to see how the other half lives.
You're about to witness, "The Ultimate Wedgie!"
I told the sucker I work for Uber. Now hurry home and tell the kids dinner's almost here.
I'm going to let him marinate for another 20 minutes.
... because he thinks I'm a dolphin. You hungry?
Not only that, he's spinning a hula hoop.
I like to save the bottom half for dessert.
So I guess now I'm a HammerToe Shark?
I'm gonna count to three...
You want to split an appetizer?
This new workplace tolerance training is so humiliating.
I decided to go with Lyft.
Yeah, well, YOU try turning down a contract with the X-Games.
Goat yoga is for sissies.
I wasn't really hungry when I found him, so I figure I'll save him for later.
The money is not great, but it's a job.
I hope you didn't cook, I brought take-out."

David and Miriam, Pacifica, C
Take out is always best the day after.
This is my friend Larry. He’s not much of a swimmer.”
Hi, I have an Uber Eats order for Bruce
The gig economy has its ups and downs.
It's not my fault you ate your chiropractor.
He asked for a ride once, and now it's, like, every day!
Working for Uber Eats has really helped pay down my student loan debt.
Going vegan has been harder than expected.
The wife didn’t feel like eating out so I picked up some fast food
I just got some takeout
What, you don’t play with your food?!
What? I'm celebrating Human Week.
The fin.  He thinks I'm a rescue porpoise.  Just wait ONE minute!
I'm just not in the mood for stalking and attacking tonight, dear, so I decided on carry-out.
He told me he'd keep an eye out for Robert Shaw.
Sharks are the scooters of the sea,” he said
you can't just let him walk all over you!
I already ate the top half, so sure you can have the rest...
Emotional support pet for now,snack if it doesn't work out.
Ya. It’s my lawyer! Professional  courtesy...gets me real close to the beach!
No, he’s not a lawyer. He’s my agent.
Being a vegan is easy.  Here, try a little I Can't Believe It's Not Human.
The dolphin said this was the best way to get more subscribers on YouTube.
Dinner is served.
I told you my friend was a "stand-up" kind of guy
Unlike you, I can live with it, Roger.
I keep telling you,
their carry out is the best”
It's a new Olympic Water Sport. . Shark Attack.
Grubhub. I was tired."
They tell me I'm part of the cutting edge of surfing.
Please don’t eat my therapy human this time, Steve.
Don't ask, he's paying me.
This gig economy is killing me.
What  kind of wine goes with shlump?
This is our version of meals on wheels
I’m sorry man, but I can’t do it without the music
I guess he thinks I'm a skate.
Hey Franck, by any chance, have you seen my lunch?
It’s your Uber Eats fresh food delivery!”
Yeah, you just sign up through the ridesharing app.
Dolphins, yes, but I also blame the breakdown of traditional aquatic values.
I'm tired of going around with a Chip on my shoulder.
We're both vegan.
It's symbiotic. He eases my back pain, and I don't eat him.
Well he was floundering and I don’t care what Spielberg says, I’m no monster
He's my brother-in-law. I tried to talk her out of it, but she said I was exhibiting a species bias.
The top half was pretty good. Saved you the legs and thighs.
Don’t knock it. I’m getting 60 bucks an hour as a powered surfboard.
Why not?  He gives a great back massage.
Want to share lunch?
He doesn't believe me when I say, 'Get off my back.'
I'll flip him and then we split  him.
He is going to have a sinking feeling soon...
My Chiropractor said it's good for the Cartilage
Oh, the quandary this poses. The Internet say,"For every human killed by a shark, humans kill approximately two million sharks."
It’s from that new take-out place down the beach. I’ll let you know later if it lives up to the buzz.
The top half tasted great, I’m just way too full to finish up.
Shall I tell him, or should you?
I mistakenly ate his board. A ride is the least I can do...
I'm no marine biologist but this doesn't feel like a sucker fish.
I tried being nice to him for once, and now he won't leave me alone.
Well, it WAS a shared ride.
Bet you a fin I can flip him and catch him before you do a full circle.
He's in training to jump the shark.
ONE LAST TIME- I go low you go high
They're paying me more than scale for Shark Week...
It's called aquatic reflexology"
I enjoy them dry on top and wet on the bottom.
You do it your way, I'll do it mine.
Apparently this is an example of what is known as "Florida Man".
It’s the same guy who was struck by lightning last week.
I just love this place.  Every massage comes with a free meal.
Haven't you ever heard of a symbiotic ashiatsu relationship?
Snack time!  Ready?  on 1...2...3!
I love to watch their face when they slip
We're a duo - I've got the fins, he's got the shins...
for now.
I heard you are a leg man.
Wait till he finds out where he really is.
I’m trying a more balanced approach to eating.
Dang, I lost mine!
I call it my "Scenic Dinner Cruise". I'm the cruise part.
My new workout?  Strength training until failure, then a high protein snack.
Normally I'd be asking myself the same question, but his specialty is sshiatsu and my dorsal fin's been killing me.
Because he's a card shark, and I owe him a fin."
Lunch is weighing me down again.
Watch this back flip! then we'll eat.
I support him for the tax breaks.
I lost a bet.
You're invading my territory again! This time I brought my lawyer.
So, after I swallowed his surfboard...
I ate his surf board  and he says I owe him."
These young kids have never even heard of Jaws.
Did you know an estimated 100 million sharks are wantonly killed every year around the world? I think it is time we doing something about that, starting right here.
We're bringing dessert.
I picked it up on my way back from the keys, hopefully it'll go away on its own.
It's the lack of respect that bothers me most.
See if this is all that's left.
The weather is getting warm and this is my first swimmer of the season.
He calls himself the "Shark Whisperer".  I'm going to wait until there's a huge crowd and then I'll rip him to shreds.
I know ... But I like ... how he rubs my neck ...
He's mine... I'm taking him for a ride.
Did you order the thighs?
You got some food on your face.
It started out as a rash.
After biting a chunk out of his surfboard, I thought that I owed him.
I guess this guy never saw Jaws!
I can’t decide; shiatsu or lunch?
I’ve turned the page, Jeff, and now think of them as family.
I've got to get my Uber driver rating back above 4 stars after last month's "incident".
Saving him for the barbecue on the 4th
i'm saving half for dessert
He seems so comfortable I can’t bear to disturb him by rolling over and eating him yet.
Wild, fresh caught!  Help yourself!
He's underwater financially and I want to be the lone shark.
It's Barnacle Bill again.
He a fantastic and loving husband, but the constant surfacing for him to breath is getting old.
Discovery Channel needs to up our pay. These Shark Week bits are getting ridiculous.
Would you like the other half?
I am getting cold feet
Yeah, I can't believe it either.
I did the damn music!
Yeah, ok, fillet of sole.
You take the left one and I’ll  take the right.
Jaw, paper, fin?"
I bet if you say, 'Hey look! A phone!" he'll jump down right away
He's outta his depth.
He's not heavy, I ate his brother!.
I offered to give him some tips. He's a loan shark.
Too skinny. I’m gonna throw this one back.
Should I tell him that he's out of his depth?
Get washed up. Dinner's on the table.
I'm willing to go halfsies.
Well, I couldn't make anything by biting people, so I started being an Uber driver.
He took me for a ride!
I find it causes less of a fuss than the fin.
If I eat him I'll lower my IQ score by 50.
Lawyer, professional courtesy.
You picked the wrong day to go vegetarian.
I'm his balance trainer, heh, heh.
Sorry honey, but it sure beats your fin massages.
Why don’t you try swimming with people
I’ve switched to live bait.
This is as close as he gets to be God and walking on water.
I pick them up for Uber, but I drop them off for Uber Eats.
There's too much news going around that sharks rarely bite humans.
Shark surfing, it’s a thing.
Have you seen the wife?
I had to pick up a side gig for Uber.
Sometimes I really wish I hadn’t gone vegan
He's got my back, Dude.  Move on!
What can I say? My stomach, like my heart, is full.
Yeah, well, you should've seen the one that got away.
He' ll teach me to walk I'll teach him to swim.
He's an intern in my law firm's summer program.
The idiot thinks I am a dolphin!!
I have the answer to, “What’s for dinner tonight?”
He wanted to impress his girlfriend but enough is enough!
Yeah, I know I should eat him, but he promised  me a part in the upcoming "Sharknado" sequel.
Cool hat Mark.
Grubhub delivery - did you order one whole swimmer and a coke?
I just can't shake this funny feeling.
I'm trying a new approach, because those suck-up dolphins aren't getting killed for their fins.
The Twelve Apostles still think He can walk on water...
I have an appointment with the doctor this week to get it removed.
Everyone takes advantage of vegans.
I could use a good toothpick in about 30 seconds.
We call the service “Unter.”
My agent says it might help our image.
He thinks he's hanging ten, but when I get through with him it'll be more like two.
Soon he'll have to change his name to Bob.
So how do you like my new periscope?
I'm cutting my portions in half.
He thinks I'm a lone shark.
I don't agree with everything he says, but I do support his platform."
Look! I found a wishbone.
Don’t laugh if I don’t eat this guy for fifteen minutes I get a second one!
I know it’s cliché, Gary, but I think it gives me an edge with the girls.
It's just that I'm not that hungry right now.
The worst part is his feet smell.
It's a potluck
It's court-ordered restitution for eating his surfboard
Pity. He was only a couple feet short of the dolphin tank.
SUP, man?
Stop judging my taste in symbiotic relationships!
Can you help me; I'm trying to get this monkey off my back.
It's a living.
Okay, flip him. Heads he’s mine, tails he’s yours
Weird. I heard him say “Hold my beer—watch this.”
You always say  “save the leftovers “, but you never eat ‘em...
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?
Well, I say just because I'm a sand shark doesn't mean you can walk all over me!
I think the remoras are evolving.
It's 2019. We're in love. And it's beautiful.
I know he's heavy, but you should see my abs.
I hate lawyers!
Not my fault. Said he was a chiropractor.
He ain’t heavy, he’s my breakfast.
Can you get him off my back?
Next time you troll the bait.
First the massage, then the meal
Stop playing with your food Larry.
I thought I'd help him find his surfboard before I eat him
And I thought barnicles were a bummer.
He wanted to say goodbye to his family.
He’s my only link to the outside world..
He said his Grandfather was on the Indianapolis, that's why.
I don't know; something about jumping the shark."
He’s a Trump supporter
You wanna take him for a while. I gotta keep movin’.
I just can’t seem to get this monkey off my back.
I'm off probation after my community service hours are completed.
This dumb surfer dude thinks I'm a dolphin.  I'm just taking him far enough out to sea that no one will hear his screams.
He said we could switch after 5 minutes. Its been 20
Its like Uber, but with stronger incentives for good tips
From the surface we look like surf boards.
I actually never been this close to one before.
Don’t ask. It’s Brexit.
It's great as bait, but the temptation to snack on it is killing me.
I'm having a lot of trouble adjusting to this new balanced diet.
They’re treading a fin line.
It started out as a bump on my fin.
It's the latest; UBER du Mer. I set my own work schedule. After training I received a discount card for seal sushi and if the client is overly abusive I can eat the them.
They call it treading water.
“He sure as hell stuck the landing!”
Weight-bearing exercise is super important as you get older.
This guy walks on my back every Wednesday. Does wonders for my sciatica.
He will soon find out he's not on a sandbar.
I think he's getting ready to jump the shark!
You want this half?
We have a kinship. His legs are great and white.
Let’s see if he can swim with one leg.”
I’d eat his foot but it smells bad.
do i have something on my back?
Soon he'll not have a leg to stand on.
Brining 101
Just until my periscope gets back from the repair shop.
Hey look at me!  I’m Carmen Miranda.
It’s the El Chapo dorsal attachment. Gets a better reaction than the fin.
Come on in ... I’m standing up!
This model really works! Get ready for a feast when all the rescuers show up.
I think they call him a sociopath--he acts like he is drowning and I get the rescuers.
And we just ate.
Fast talking salesman... you go in for a massage, and come back with an edible periscope.
He thinks he’s in the shallows.
My dermatologist tells me it is nothing to be concerned with.
Apparently it is a form of extreme surfing. Let's hope it doesn't catch on
He’s a Shark Fin Soup protestor!
They just don't fear us anymore ever since those "Sharknado" movies came out.
I know, I know, but I like the way his toes tickle my back.
Dude thinks he's Aqua-man.
This second job as an Uber driver is really breaking my back.
I'm giving him a leg up before I take it.
Sea World has the nerve to call this "a promotion"?
It's my community service and its killing me.
Finders, keepers!
But I like to play with my food!
Surfers!
Well, at least we're not at Sea World.
We’re not allowed to bite until he learns to tread water.
It's a Finn.
I ordered my meal “to go.”
He’s made no eye contact whatsoever and has been on the phone since he stepped off shore!
They're better marinated.
Now I understand why the oceans are warming.
Yeah, well, you should see his other half. Course, you can't.
It's called 'symbiosis' Jim.
Ability to delay gratification correlates with higher SAT scores and greater success later in life.
Yeah Jack. All they see from shore is a guy bobbing around having fun. It's my sure-fire meal ticket!
I have a feeling 'Jaws 5: Shark Surfer' is going to flop!
I know I said I'd be home an hour ago, but look -- I brought you my leftovers!
Just wait, he won't have a leg to stand on.
For being a Shepard of the sea, Aquaman is kinda an ass
Saved you the lower half
It beats trying to use my fin for the itch on my back.
This is what it takes to be a Superhost.
My wife wants me to save money. I'm taking my lunch to work.
I 'm taking a course in Anger Management"
Lyft was hiring. I needed money. Don't mess this up for me.
I'm a rebel, Ma. I'll play with my food.
It’s like shooting one of us in a barrel.
I know this area is for members only--I'm about to take care of that.
Let's see how they like it when we take one of their Finns
It's a perfect meal. Surf & Turf.
I always get mine "to go."
I cannot say he won’t be eaten.
I know, but I felt sorry for the skinny bastard.
The back massage comes with a lunch option.
So next I flip it up into the air and catch it in my jaws.
I’m on Step 9, Making Amends.
Camouflage.
I hate it when the old Sea World training kicks in.
I love getting my weekly shiatsu!
First he called me Shamu, then...
I'll stay here while you grab dinner for us both.
They said 'Nice board shorts,' but he heard 'nice bored sharks.'
This vegan diet is for the birds!
I prefer mine with ketchup.
My therapist says I need to submit more.
This vegan diet is driving me crazy.
We have been here for 50 million years and all of a sudden these guys are stepping on us and scream bloody murder if we bite them.
It's called Shark Lyft, and no you are not going to bite into my profits.
I'm just really full right now.
I'm saving this half for later.
I can raise the average IQ in this ocean during lunch.
This is why I'm always humming "Duh-dumb, duh-dumb" before I eat these things.
It's totally copasetic. I get the surfers, he gets their boards.
Damn. Always when I’m meditating. Can you get this one?
I'm stuffed after that last swimmer, but please, feel free to help yourself.
Because then I'd have to find a new chiropractor, genius.
What ever happened to the thrill of the hunt?
Don't tell me you thought he really walked on water
Bad timing  for us starting that vegetarian diet, Marshall.
I'm scared - he's a loan shark!
Your turn for "William Tell"
So he doesn't realise he's standing on shaky ground.  Are you going to tell him?
Hor d'oeuvres at 5:00 PM OK?
Apparently this is the new tracking tag system.
It is called Ride Sharing.
They always taste better without a struggle.
Do I have a parasite on my back?
I know, I know. "Don't play with your food."
I'm waiting for him to stop peeing.
Great for your back, though
Uber Boat may pay the bills, but nothing beats Uber Eats.
Professional courtesy, he’s an attorney.
He aint heavy. He's my brother.
I've never recovered from life at Sea World.
Kevin, please don’t tell my dad...
Well, how did YOU think he walked on water, Ezekiel?
I didn’t know what having a monkey on my back really meant...
In my previous life as a dog, I learned to balance treats on my nose.
He requested one last selfie.
I thought this kind of stuff ended when Steve Irwin died.
Don't laugh, that itch was driving me crazy.
I just don't have the heart to move. He thinks I'm a sandbar.
It worked! Here comes his buddy!
You can eat him after he’s done giving me a back rub.
Ask him to move back and to the right.
I’m in anger management therapy.
Is there something on me?
‘’This is when my psychology degree comes in handy,let him think he’s the one in control  and his friends will want to join him.’’
Here's betting he never saw Jaws
Jeez Bob. The boss has been on my back all week!
The stand-up paddleboard craze has brought me a lot of new clients.
Support sharks are allowed now."
White meat - again!
After we eat him, we can
 break the wishbone.
I’m full. I thought I’d  leave the rest for you.
He thinks he's riding the crest of success.
I don't like this job either, bit it pays the rent.
Just let it go, Josh. The poor bastard is up there screaming 'California Dreaming' at the top of his lungs.
It's that damned "Baby Shark" song I blame for ruining our reputation
Damn millennials.
He’s from Sea World
He got 'Standing on the shoulder of giants' all wrong.
I said, "Okay, sure you can swim with the sharks, but who the hell gave them permission to stand on us?"
Grown up shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo …
It may look demeaning, but I'm told it's called 'rideshare'.
Uber is thinking of expanding into new markets
I'm not exactly getting paid for the shoot, but I'll get a vignette in the special features.
I like working for Uber Eats.
Just wait ‘til he tries 
to hang-ten.
It's the latest new spa package - Thai massage, then lunch.
You ordered the veggie lover, hold the sun screen.
Technically, I caught him first !!
You smell something fishy?
Jaws wouldn't let this stand.
I'll give this guy 10 seconds to get off my back!
Well sure, it's embarrassing, but if Clara found out I've eaten between meals I'd never hear the end of it.
He has no idea !
I would have eaten fewer of them had I known how good it feels to have them walk on my back.
This guy must have gills of steel. I've been trying to drown him for hours.
His Thai massage is to die for!
My job is to catch the guys who don't get the metaphor.
He wants one last selfie.
He's found the sweet spot. I can't reach him.
I work as a tourist trap.
The worst part is being taken for granted.
Now do you believe I used to work at Sea World?
Where's the respect.
Just bringing some leftovers to a potluck.
I rented myself out as a floatation device. Imagine his surprise when he gets the bill.
I was fine with it till he started with the theme music.
We'll have leftovers for dinner, is that O K with you?
Our relation is somelike long distance relation but more itimate.
I'm training him to attract bait.
It's not my taste but I got it half off.
Welcome to Long Island, where they used to fear us
I think it's a wishbone. Make a wish and on the count of three ...
It pays the bills.
Did you order the human?
But my back was killing me.
Please, Doc! You gotta help me get this monkey off my back!
Did you tell him we charge for rides?
My therapist said to keep calm but...he's really pushing my limits here
Thought he could jump the shark!
He's a dentist. Can he fix my bite?
He thinks he's having a fabulous ride on his surfboard
Ok, I'm trying to get with the new "Kindness PR" thing for sharks, but this is way too irritating!
It's the new ride share called aqualyft.
I can't get him of my back.
It's a new reality show that's a mash up of Shark Tank and Survivor.
To combat our bad reputation, I thought I'd try the eco-tourism angle.
Better than that shiatsu chair I bought.
I'm saving this half for dinner.
I like mine semi-dry, shaken, not stirred.
Seriously?"  "I know... I just didn't have the heart to tell him...
I knew I shouldn't have become a vegetarian...
Take-out for lunch
Yeah! They’re not even as meaty  as the chicken wings down at  The Ocean Club.
Where's Katy Perry?
He'd better not start peeing...
Once you deliver them to their destinations, you get to eat 25%.
The jerk thinks I'm a coral reef- what the hell could I do??!
I believe I was a surfboard in a previous life.
He feeds me.
I decided to try the new take-out spot everybody’s been raving about.
God is great.  God is good.  Let us thank him for this food.
What do you mean I have food on my face?
I am regretting being a pescatarian...
His feet tickle
Wanna give him a pedicure?
Get paid to advertise on your head”
I found him on decoys.com
Lyft wasn't kidding about inclusion!
I know... I know it's unbecoming....  but the dude has a wicked Oriental foot massage technique.
The invitation said "Bring you own food".
Thanks to global warming, Sharq is the new Lyft.
I think that's President Trump looking for his golf ball.
He promised that I  would star in the remake of “Jaws”.
Well, he's a lawyer. And a very good one at that.
It’s professional courtesy- he’s a lawyer who got in over his head.
Hi sweetie. Just wanted to show you that I am not a bottom feeder.
I'm so sorry honey. I couldn't find a chubby one this week.
You're so late that I decided to start lunch without you.
I took him to Key West and now he wants to go to Mara Lago
Doctor says it will help me quit
Yes, I am STILL working on it!
He thinks he's on solid footing... watch this.
Jaws" Guilt...
First they came for the whales...
Slim pickens this season.
At least with Scuber I get to set my own hours.
His toenails are a little sharp.
It’s a symbiotic relationship
I thought I might as well bring lunch.
Fishing. Can you believe it?
He's for my hard-to-scratch spots.
He came into the Tank promising his “patent pending” online beachwear had amazing sales and growth.  Now I’m literally keeping him afloat.
The waters getting warmer, and I actually hope it’s climate change
It’s Ramadan.
Did anyone order Scuba Eats?
Thought I’d get a foot massage before dinner.
I can set my own hours and don't need a medallion.
Well, it's a living...
Professional courtesy to lawyers
Frank Buckley Andover, MA
Get Spielberg on the line. He needs to make another one
I blame hoverboards.
Well it’s better than being shark fin soup.
He didn’t get the memo - it’s JUMP the shark idiot!
It's part of my community service for that incident last summer.
I considered Lyft, but Uber gets me more business.
It's like Uber, for sharks.
I’m going to miss him after I eat him.
I ate half, and I'm saving the rest for a snack later.
I joined Lyft. This gig economy is getting me down.
I like to marinate my meat first.
I figure with the current state of politics they’ve got enough going on.
I'm afraid if I eat him it'll affect my star rating.
Enough of this, Are you ready to make a trade?
I never leave without a packed lunch on my back.
I haven't the heart to let him know I'm not a rock.
Wait'll he decides to step off!
Do we really want to attack the last member of the species that doesn't believe in global warming?
Dark or light?
It's like Lyft and Uber Eats all in one.
If you order a decoy, spend the extra money for the model that waves its arms and screams Help!
And then when back feels better,  you eat it!
I’ll split him with you if you get him off my back
You know I am a vegan, Jessica.
Your turn, I need to go down
Would you like to invite him for dinner, or shall I?
They've really become too comfortable after that Nemo movie.
Seriously.  What did you do with his surfboard?
I caught this one off the coast oF Long Island
This politically correct thing is starting to grate
It's a little demeaning, but my small business is thriving.
I thought this was a potluck!
Too lean for me. Wanna try a bite?
I’ve always wanted to be a dolphin.
So I started driving for SCUBER  .
I mean I’m back and forth anyway.
it's like their marshmallow test, Dear... just eat him right now and risk the beach closing down...or wait 15minutes and feast when all his idiot buddies join!
He thinks this is the shallow end and I don't have the heart to tell him.
Well at least he’s no longer skateboarding.
Ugh . . . what fresh hell is this?
He thinks he can still touch here. At this point I don’t know how to leave.
Next time I`ll go for the deep tissue, instead of the Thai massage.
So, I see yours jumped the shark.
People are friends, not food.
Kiss me and I will Share.
Watch me do a 180 and end this stand up paddle boarding craze forever.
He thinks he is on his surfboard!
Unfortunately we do not have a leg to stand on.
I know; I'm an embarrassment to my species"
Uber went under.
Yes it's stylish, but the screaming is starting to bother me.
He’ll attract the tastier ones
It's a steady gig until they get the L train fixed...
Humans are a pain in the neck
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water.
I'm tired of dining on all of these free loaders."
I  gave him a choice. Be my periscope, or be my lunch.
Nah, this one's an hors d'oeuvre.
I felt guilty for taking a bite out of his surfboard
He's just a chum.
Let's grab lunch.
I could eat. All I had today was a bagel.
I ordered carry out, and they  served me the counter man.
As you'd guess from the legs, this species is called the Pale White.
I was catfished.
He's an "ocean half full" kinda guy.
I'm using his GPS.
My plan is to take him six feet under.
It's not my dream job, but he pays me scale.
I ate his surfboard.
Harvard Law. I'm stuck with him for the next twelve weeks.
Did you call UberEats?
They would call it chum.
As soon as I get hungry he won't have a leg to stand on.
So, now I'm a loan shark.
Which half do you want?
Show a little professional courtesy to a lawyer, then what?
White meat or dark meat?
Don't tell the guys, but I volunteer at You-Can-Swim on Fridays.
He started with with praise and small fishes just like he did with the Orcas.
Why do I always get stuck with the drumsticks?
I call it a periscope.
If he shouts "Cowabunga!" one more time he's an appetizer.
He followed me home; can I keep him?
It's called symbiosis, Barry. I get a back massage and he gets to not be lunch.
Lay off Killer. Our PR has been terrible since Jaws.
I wish they’d cut their toenails.
He's outside my HMO coverage,but what he does for my dorsal pain is worth it's weight in seal.
The hardest part is giving up human.
Supposedly the adjustments will help with my lower fin issues. We'll see.
I am planning on a light lunch.
This joker is about to get a food chain lesson he'll never forget.
It's part of the corporate training they're making us do called Being the Master of Your Impulses or some such b.s. like that.
Works great for my sciatica.
I’ve already had my day’s limit. Any interest?
Of course I could eat him. But you forgot I’m a vegan.
Think of it as bait.
You want a Piece of this?
He thinks I’m Flipper, lol
It's my lawyer, he's like family.
What... like you don't have any fetishes?
I told you I'd get a leg up on you.
I thought it looked nice... But if you really hate it that much, I’ll return it.
Don’t say a word...he was dog paddling and got tired, what was I suppose to do?
Sure, take it.  But the upper half gave me gas.
Don't laugh, it keeps the dorsal fin from showing. I can get super close before they realize I'm about to attack.
I prefer the pilot fish cleaning
So I figured, what the hell, why not moonlight as a Segway?
I'm going to be late tonight. ...my boss has been on my back all week.
Oh
I thought it was a potluck!
Ocean Uber Eats
Got any ketchup?
He won’t swim with us. He says wading is safer.
It sucks being vegan.
Just let them think you're a dolphin. We'll catch more that way.
We gotta start targeting these millennials.
I like a balanced diet.
'Super Glue."
He's all yours. I'll be the dolphin this time.
I ordered it this morning on Amazon.
Yes, Uber is hiring.
Its not my fault it you didn't pack a lunch
I just ate, so I'm keeping him for tomorrow.
Yeah, he wants to settle down but you know me. I have to keep moving.
One Man's Uber is another Shark's Grubhub.
Do you want the legs? I'm not a fan of dark meat.
I bit his surfboard in half and this is part of the settlement.
Is this a good wishbone or what?
I was raised in Seaworld.
I can't talk now.  My food is burning.
Here, you can have the bottom half.
I can't eat him he owes me money, so I'm forced to carry him for awhile.
Are you ready to make a wish?
Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
He’s my spotter.
The polls say it makes me less threatening.
Its an experiment, see if we can develop a symbiotic relationship.
If this is what he thought they meant by 'swimming with the sharks', I'm going to show him what it means to put 'foot in mouth'.
It's a new fad with a huge downside
Vegan sucks.
White man’s always keepin’ me down, man.
Do you smell something?
Of course I'm hesitating--I was a broker in my previous life.
Here’s your meat order!
Pet humans suck!
I'm using him as bait for something meatier
Ever heard of the Marshmallow Test?
HE THOUGHT THEY SAID BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, NOT SHARK
He just said come on in the water's fine. Tell the kids dinner will be ready in two minutes."
This is my final test in my weight loss management course.
I have no qualms about eating something that stupid.
The flailing is more inspired when they're well rested.
This new yoga is all the rage...humans climb on your back.
Listen, I’m sick of this Circue de Soleil stuff. It’s your turn!
Yeah, I know how it looks, but Dolphin World was the only one hiring.
Yes, but I’m a lot more tempted when he hangs ten.
Where would you like to have dinner tonight?
I always thought that "headstand" was something different!
I'll do dinner tonight.
I've had this persistent headache since shark surfing became a trend.
This is what I get for eating his board.

It's this new thing called Uber Shark. You should sign up.
They are calling it Scuber.
I'm just waiting for it to marinate.
You're late! Dinner's getting cold
Go ahead they taste like chicken.
I’ll admit, Uber Surfing is a niche market, but lunch is free.
If they take a selfie and don’t tag me, I eat them.
It was funnier in the conception than the execution.
In five minutes time he won't have a leg to stand on
I don't want to drive Uber forever, but it pays the bills for now.
He used to keep a lookout perched on someone else's gigantic tail.
It's called 'yoga'.  I hear the humans do it with goats in Portland.

They're from the gifted youth program

False sense of security, and then breakfast.
I'm running him over to Martha's Vineyard and he promised to give me a toe.
It’s a new anti man-eating intervention program.
I brought a little snack. Would you like a bite?

Incredible balance and breathe control.
Love your morsel fin
He asked if he could just stick around to so show his girlfriend”
That does it! I'm moving outta his wifi range.
They gave me honorable mention for the ‘Family Beach Camouflaged Hat’ category.
It's somewhat annoying but they taste way better when caught fresh.
Bite me in the snout next time I say work well with people.
Scram! After he takes the selfie, he's my lunch.
Is being vegan written all over my fins?
This one is a slam-dunk. I dunk him. You slam him.
Karl, don't play with your food.
Humans are friends, not food Jim.
Oh boy Surfer Surprise for dinner tonight!
Our dining experience just isn't the same. He hasn't looked up from his phone once.
Stopped smoking weeks ago but there is still a monkey on my back.
You’ve never had a foot massage?  Oh, man, try it!
Whadd ya mean , 'four squid is TOO much for a skinny one'? You do the shopping next time.

I wasn’t that hungry so I’ll finish it later.
Dinner's on the table.
Let him post a few selfies first.
Periscope up!
Have you seen the guy with the tasty looking legs?
He’s my midnight snack.
These Shark Week photographers are getting pretty bold.
So, I launched into my Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry impersonation.  I said 'you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?'  Epic non reaction. Zip, zero, nada."
I know it's unconventional, but it really helps loosen up my back.

Be still, he is calling for his friends to swim over this way.
This will be his last selfie
Does this make me look fat?
I’m pretty sure it was Francine that gave him to me. Anyway I gotta be more careful when I’m drinking.
I ordered him sunny side up.
I'm sick of this topping.
It's not deep.....
I deal with this every year during Shark Week
Your wish has come true, that is Mark Cuban.
I've decided to go back on the Paleo diet.

You ordered Jake tartare?

He’s marinating.
I am just carrying a snack with me.

Robert Van Brocklin, Portland, Ore
I hear this all started with goat yoga.
You should see the other half.
I can't decide to eat him or keep him as my personal masseuse. I must admit it feels good!
He calls it "shark surfing," I call it "toppings."
If you can't eat 'em, buoy 'em.
He said he's got an idea to get us on "Shark Tank."
Then pollution gets worse and worse each year.
The stupid ones taste terrible!
He's head and shoulders above the rest.
They ran out of doggie bags.
I think he said "Hey guys, I found the sand bar!"
I'm totally addicted to home delivery; the food is always warm, too.
Perhaps a low I.Q. individual?
Just download the app: It’s “sharx” with an “x”
After the massage I'll share a leg with you.
I'm his Uber Pool.
But,I saw him first !
Water taxi is my side hustle
You ordered the legs?
The hard part was finding a taxidermist for this trophy.
If he takes another step or two, he's saltimbocca.
I've got a bite.
I don’t care what he looks like.
He’s my son.
''I owe him 'cause I ate his surfboard.''
What can I do? He is a lawyer.
And I thought remoras were annoying.
He promised to convince the swim class kids that it wasn’t that deep
My back hasn't felt so good in years.
Just my luck, his feet stink to high heaven.
Why does the President always have to rely on us to keep him afloat?
When it's my turn, I'll have him stick his head in my mouth.
I just ate breakfast at the 'Ride a Dolphin' attraction and picked us up some take-out.
His fearless naivety was so endearing I couldn't eat him.
I made a deal. He’s on seal patrol.

Dan Barrett, Chatham, MA
As soon as I finish with this massage, maybe we can stop for a bite.

I've been trying to save money by bringing my lunch to work.
I call it Swyft - my new app based water taxi service.
Unfortunately, this is meatless Friday.
My client ignored the advice not to take the stand.
This intermittent fasting is getting harder and harder.
He does not take advantage of me! It's a symbiotic relationship.
My shrink says I keep giving up my power.
You're right.  It is a bit like shiatsu.
Well, there are benefits for me too.
Pilot fish are so passé
He’s a lawyer. It’s professional courtesy.
No, he can’t hang ten.
How do I tell him?
Met him at Montauk.  Twenty bucks to take him to Sag Harbor ain't bad.
May I recommend a nice cabernet sauvignon to go with the gentleman’s entree?
He ain’t heavy, he’s my chum
It's a shame he didn't come with more legs.
Hey - find your own elasmobranchii craniosacral shiatsu practitioner.
Your wife has you doing Meatless Mondays too, huh?
It's funny. He said he was drowning in student debt. Now he calls me his loan shark.
Not for just anyone. He's a good chum.
Why am I giving him a joy ride? He gets relaxed and the meat will be tender!
Okay, but I only sold out to A man, not THE man.
I don't care which cultures still eat our fins, I'm not gonna racially profile this guy!
What? I can't get a massage once in a while?
I'm a surfboard.  This is my life now.
I feel so much better since I went vegan.
I’m part of a new Uber service
Wait until you see him, he's scarier than my dorsal fin could ever be.
Does this hat make my fin look fat?
It’s a great bait
I never go anywhere without a snack.
Yeah, but if I get hungry, I just dive.
I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like if I say something, that makes me the rude one.
On the other hand, if I do dispose of him, I'll never get rid of those pesky remoras.
I love posing as a sandbar before dinner.
You Frank? Good, here's your Scuber Eats delivery.
My internist recommended daily back-walking spinal manipulations to release stress-related dorsal fin tension.
Perhaps Darwin was right.  This guy claims he is my Uncle Bill.
I don't think he understands the whole "jumping the shark" thing.

Get out of the way, I need five stars for this ride.
They're better when you marinate them.
When he jumped onboard he kept calling me Uber.
This 'Vegan Shark' ploy is brilliant, Bruce.  Just two more days..."
He's gonna have to get a bigger shark.
What did you do with the other half?
Do you know what it's like to be stuck with Richard Dreyfuss
He won the Shark Tank, and I lost.
Parasite Laws are Horrible!
I’m letting him rest for a moment, they say it makes the meat more tender.
Go look -- it feels like a set-up.
Do I tell him?
He thinks he's standing on the sand. Should we tell him?
I'm just giving him a false sense of security.
There's a new sushi takeout sandbar – off the west end of the pier.
If I let you take a bite it will ruin my rating.
I know, I know, but he promised me lots of krill.
We’ll both die if I stop moving.
He's auditioning for America's Got Talent.
They're too stupid to eat.
Hi, honey--I brought dinner.
I'm using him a bait.
Yeah, but the pay is good.
i left you half.
I don’t care if he is a big shot attorney, this professional courtesy thing has gotten out of hand.
I was typecast as “Jaws,” my career dried up and now I’m doing this.
I have the profile of a surfboard.
Ya wanna come over for some leftovers?
I never though massage therapy was this good,Bob
He's annoying me but I just ate.  Have you eaten yet?
Sorry I can't fish with you today; he doesn't know how to swim.
What? You've never had chicken legs before?
Oh yeah? Let's see YOU swallow a surfboard in one bite!
They say it's good for your posture.
I like to play with my food first . . . you?
He was a surfer, I missed.
My therapist told me it would help with developing patience
Welcome to Shark Tank, Mr. Johnson.
We'll attack after he posts his selfie.
For dramatic effect I have him make the “dunn dun, dunn dun” noise as I approach the shore.
If I can't get a seal, he's my Plan B ...
Well, how do you carry “take-out”?
I've been working for Green Surfboard for a year now.
It’s the latest thing at my yoga studio.
But I do kinda admire his chutzpah
Your order is ready.
I am bringing him home for dinner.
We have an arrangement. He runs a cruise line.
Because he lost his flippers.
You’re acting like you’ve never seen a Hammertoe shark before.
It's a temporary symbiotic relationship; he likes to surf, I like to eat.
You just download the app.
Do you want the legs or the chest?
Personal Injury clients are always asking for support.
Go ahead and laugh, I'm trying out a 'Stand Up' comedy routine
But you said you couldn't 'stand' humans.
It feels so good on my back I am not even hungry.
Yeah, I can’t stand Shark Week either, Fred.
This way people  think he can walk on water.
I am saving him -- for Lunch.
Give me a break.  I owe him one.  I ate his mother.
It's take out.
I saw him first!
He doesn’t know my favorite story is “The Gingerbread Man”!
Then why do I feel like I’m at the bottom-of-the-foot chain, Gary?
How about we split 50-50?
he's pitching a shark repellant on Shark Tank
Oh I know, I'm saving it for later.
He's pushing my vegan commitment to the limits.
I’ll eat him right after he’s done with my massage!
Call me Primitive!  I don't need a table and napkins for dinner.
This is getting too easy
I'll split him with you if you eat the pants.
It's Japanese. It's called shiatsu.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying."
I'll take him out past the surf-line,and we can all have a bite.
This new rideshare gig is a pain in the neck.
You want him? I gave up meat for lent.
I ate his surf board and this is what the judge came up with.  It's only on the weekends until i can come up with the cash.  But you can eat him if you want...
No Bob, it’s called ashiatsu massage.
Let's just say he's my wingman.
Whadda think of my new hat?
Hey, I don’t see you having any luck finding a job
I told him I was a dolphin in disguise.
You can't let people walk all over you.
He got on at Coney Island !
This is EXACTLY what it looks like.
It’s my new start up. I call it ‘Under Eats’.  You think it has fins?
He needs work on his sea legs.
The store was fresh out of periscopes.
I can’t believe you didn’t get the Aquaman 2 callback too.
When I volunteered to be a "support" animal, I thought it meant emotional support.
It's an investment, he is posting on Instagram.
I'm trying to eat smarter.
Here's your delivery, thanks for using UberEats.
My kind of restaurant. Standing room only.
Should I tell him I ate his paddle board?
Growth? What growth?
My lawyer's pulling rank.
No thanks, I don't need to go out for lunch.  I brought mine.
Never fails. These inflatable humans always manage to scare the baby sharks.
After synchronized swimming, I'm having him for dinner.
We're hoping to go viral.
He's looking for Spielberg. He works for me.
I hate working at Sea World.
Another whale watcher.
I told the wife I'd bring home dinner.
It’s my side hustle.
Split him now and nosh later?
That's it. I'm so done entertaining people at SeaWorld.
I've heard they taste better with a squeeze of lemon.
Well, I get great back massages and luckily for him, it curbs my appetite.
I'm trying to be dolphin-like, but I should just be myself.
I want to eat him but hes growing on me....
Invitation said we're all supposed to wear party hats.
Yeah, but you should see what I did to his surfboard.
He thought he was appearing ON Shark Tank! Heh
Nobody fears us since "Baby Shark Doo Doo" came out.
He's on thin ice, well, was on thin ice.
Jesus is up to his old tricks again.
I had to take a 2nd job as a lyft driver.
My overbite is the problem.
Don’t do it, Sid. Remember what Mom said. Those things’ll cause splinters in your throat.
I'm thinking about the roll and snap maneuver.
We met on Tinder. He thinks I'm of a plankton-eating variety.
And I'm not even hungry now.
In about 2 seconds: the 'sandbar' strikes back.
Yes, I’m now employed  by Uber.
He's a stand-up type of guy.
Back off! Get your own surfwich!
Go away. We're a lone shark.
I wasn't very hungry, so I got half my lunch to go.
And I though remoras were a pain.
He doesn't understand who the frog and who the scorpion is in this scenario
When it stops itching, then we'll eat.
Just be honest with me, how bad does it look?
Honey,I can’t get dinner off my mind.
It started a few months ago as a small bump on my back!
Don’t judge.
Looks like six more weeks of winter.
The doctor says it’ll clear up if I swim in colder waters.
It's for later.
I get no respect.
And heʻs singing the Baby Shark song
Think cognitive dissonance.
It's my sinuses. Feels like something is sitting on my face.
He hasn’t  seen the movie yet!
I drive for Uber.  The money's not so good, but meals are free.
He says he has my back.
What was I to do? I ate his mother, and he needed a ride home.
Don't even think about it. It's called Thai massage and I've paid 20 bucks.
Hey, George, can you help me out?  Is this a pimple on my forehead?
'Dolphin gigs pay.'
I think you’re right. This is an  unanticipated shift in the service economy.
He's on top of me, isn't he?
We can't bite him. Ecotourism is where the money's at.
You can have him, he's gluten free.
It is called Uber and it pays quite well
It’s a new X-Game sport... sharkboarding.
Wanna play 'wishbone'?

He says he's a lawyer and wants professional courtesy.
The "Coral Seas" now has take-out.

I guess one sandy surface feels like any other.
I get a good back rub AND lunch.
Take out.
I'm teaching him how to jump the shark
He double-dared me not to eat him.
Standing room only at the Jaws Fest.
I thought I would bring a snack for the trip.
We have a symbiotic relationship - he claims to be eco-friendly not needing a boat and I get human prey easily
It's that cocky Roy Scheider!
If only this guy knew how "in over his head" he really is.
Your Uber Eats order is ready.
He wants us to join his firm
When you asked me if I would be your stand in, I didn’t think it meant this.
I just didn't have the heart.
200 hours of Community Service.
Let's wait until he's finished texting.
It’s called “Sea Uber”. I’m taking this one to Montauk.
I just wish the lifeguard would get off my back.
I brought a snack.
How long do we need to support this guy !
I don't have the heart to tell him that he won't have a leg to stand on.
INFESTED with humans, more like.
He's lucky we've gone vegan last week.
I try not to cause panics, but they really make it hard.
Mom, I’m a dolphin
I was burned out.  I am trying something meaningful.
Take over for me,  Will you? I’ve just got to get a bite to eat.
no, you can't have the legs again.
Relax, there's no top part."
Meh. They taste like chicken.
The food chain is a bit screwed up.
It’s a symbiotic relationship so back off.
I just feel bad for the ones who can't even swim.
It's Mueller. He's riding it out.
This guy is very lucky that I'm not ticklish.
It is such a hassle bringing your own food to the beach.
Another twenty seconds and I get to scratch his.
I thought 'getting then off your back' was just a manner of speaking!
Don't touch, I'm working.  How else did you think these dumb humans participate in Synchronized Swimming."
You like it? I picked it up on vacation.
It's the new LIFT service.
He's happy keeping his head above water but I'm taking him for a ride!
Who does he think I am, Uber?
You take the bottom half
I just ate.  Do you want this son of a beach?
I know it's embarrassing, but times are tough and this Uber Scuber gig helps  a lot.
Have you seen his top half?
Well, what's YOUR side gig?
It's called a side hustle.
Who let this guy into their PhD program?
He's lucky I've gone vegan.
He’s really not getting my drift.
Apparently it's a killer core workout."
I wanted to have it removed, but insurance wouldn’t cover it.
I'm waiting for just the right moment
It's one of those no frills around the world cruise
But Uber takes most of the fare. I keep almost nothing.
I need to find a new job.
He didn't want me to be a lone shark.
So, how shall I convince him that he doesn't have a leg to stand on?
... and they think they are at the top of the food chain.
I'm delaying gratification.
He thinks I'm a dolphin rescuing him.
He does wonders for my sciatica
Brining and sun drying: salt, fat, acid, heat.  Don't you read?
I'd say he's a foot and a half from disaster--maybe two feet.
Do you want him or not?
"Yeah, but the sciatica relief is unparalleled.
Do I look like a pig to you?
Humiliating work but they cover dental.
Gerald, Stop playing with your food!
I can’t get that Baby Shark song out of my head.
He gets a ride for free and I get another set of eyes.
My guess is this moron never watched the movie Jaws!
It's the reboot--he's too old now to actually make it over me.
Going vegan is a delicate balancing act.
His wife said to surprise him.
Just a little snack for later.
I thought they said to pack a lunch???
I’m working for Uber. A bucket of chum gets them a trip to the island.
I lost a bet with him, sucks, embarrassing.
I'm keeping this one really fresh, perfect for a nice quiet lunch instead of the usual frenzy.
You told me you liked legs over easy!
There's really nothing as satisfying as Ashiatsu barefoot back massage.
No, it's not like shooting fish in a barrel.
Is it lunch time yet?
Disgusting.. it's a literal Jaws remake titled 'No Guts, No Glory.'
He said he’s a fascinator.
Harry. Get it. Get it. It's 'surfing turf!'
If it's smaller than a 10 wide, I throw it back."
This new diet is crushing me with everything I can't eat
I'm sick of acting kind.
It beats getting punched in the nose.
Reparations.
And his feet are all slimy and gross, too!
He says he's The Fonz and he's going to ruin television forever.
What, I signed up to be a UBER driver.
It’s Trump! He can’t swim !
I accidentally ate his surf board. I was either this, or ... do you know how expensive those things are?
'cuz you are what you eat
Have you seen the movie, Jaws?
Migrate early, they said.
Making up for the one I ate"
Is this the future of climate change?
There's nothing better than an ashiatsu massage before dinner.
Don't eat him - this back massage is doing wonders for neck pain.
Yeah,now he's got my back,but later I get his.
Hold my beer
I’d eat him, but he’s scratching an itch.
It's amazing what you can pick up body surfing the net these days...
This is not what I had in mind for a "movable feast''!
I just ate. I'm saving him for later.
In my other life I was a surfboard.
I got five yelps from my last meal...ready to count?
It's for an instagram post. When he stops filming I'm going to eat him.
I agree... Ever since Aquaman went vegan, he's been acting like such a wimp.
It’s Jimmy Buffet, you imbecile!
He’s not as irritating as a ramora, and getting into The Hamptons is a snap.
He's from Finland
Yes, Uber has hit the open seas. I figured I'd try it for a while as I'm always just cruising around anyway.
I keep telling him I'm a fish not a mammal.
He's ours. You bring the avocado and I'll bring the cilantro.
I guess goat yoga is passé.
Why, it's ashiatsu massage, of course!
You didn't know I work for Lyft?
Until Shark Week starts filming again, I have to make ends meet by providing ride-sharing for swimmers.
You've got to believe me,it's completely platonic.
Don’t. It’s not worth the publicity.
Nothing beats a neck massage before dinner.
He gives great massages, and is cheaper and neater than a pygmy goat.
Oh yeah right there. This guy really gets the kinks outta my dorsal.
It's still better than wearing Crocs.
It actually relieves my back pain.
Say, aren't the chum portions getting larger?
I’m trying shiatsu for my migraines.
Vegetarian Shark Week sucks.
Did you wait 30 minutes before swimming first?
He's my fish finder.
I thought I had tops.
The script clearly says ‘Fonzie JUMPS the shark’, Karl... I don’t get paid enough for this crap.
If this edible hat thing catches on I'll eat my hat
Let's share.
His tattoo says “Babe Magnet” so I have an idea...
He’s with me.
It was you who suggested we try reiki
I think of him as an attractive nuisance...
Bite this jerk for me, will you Sid?
He thinks he’s in surfing school.
He thinks he’s walking on water.
No more messing with me—finally got my sea legs!
Do you want the leftovers?
I don't want to bite him. YOU bite him.
I’m waiting until dinnertime.
This actually helps relieve a lot of tension on my dorsal.
Would you like to share lunch?
My driver rating is 4.95. People love not being eaten.
Court orders ...!
This massage promises a happy ending - the question is whose?
I'm just waiting 'til lunchtime....
I get my dinner to go.
I brought my lunch today.
The doctor said it would help with my lower fin
yeah,crazy huh? he mentioned something about a scorpion and a frog...
If the rest is anything like the legs, he’s all yours.
It's a scab.  My pilot fish are on strike.
They call it fish boarding; I call it trolling.
ShUber. Don't judge me.
What? Patience is a virtue.
Now, watch while I flip this up and catch it in my mouth.
He told me about a new kind of yoga, and I said: "Sure, my Dorsal's been killing me!"
Who him? His name is Fonzi.
He says he likes living on the edge.
This one needs to cook a little longer.
keepin' him alive and fresh until I'm hungry
He said he was looking for Crocs.
I figure, use some bait.
I can’t eat him until I cash out of his hedge fund.
Can you feel bone spurs
ok, the coast is clear.  It is your turn to go fish!
I thought only elephants had trunks.
Because he's managing partner, that's why.
Don't look at me like that! YOU had a monitoring device attached just last year!
Do you have a problem with professional courtesy?  He’s a lawyer.
I'm saving half for tomorrow's lunch.
My humiliation is complete.
Go ahead. Dare him to hang ten.
Does this make me into a nurse shark.
He's sooo lucky I've become a vegan.
We have a "You scratch my back, I'll remove your calluses" type of relationship.
Do you think he can surf with one leg?
When they think you’re a reef it takes all the fun out of it.
yeah I bought it on Amazon!  Best lure ever!  Fake a drowning and a whole bunch more come for dinner!
It's the latest thing. It's called a "to go" snack.
The kids wanted takeout.
What can I say? I owed him a favor.
I feel bad that I ate his surfboard.
Sure I like a challenge, but sometimes I’m just hungry.
I know you told me not to play with my food but it's just too much fun.
This sharkboarding is exhausting!
Yeah, they call it "sharkboarding", can you imagine?
Best bobbing-head doll I’ve ever had!
...But dude! You should have seen us in the barrel!
It’s simple: you take one, I take the other, and each of us makes a wish.
I'm a loan shark, he'll pay for this!
I  know but it's too early for lunch.
Of all the days to decide to become a vegetarian...
Now, it’s clear how Jesus performed the miracle of walking on water.
He keeps calling me “Flipper” too.
No Jerry, I don't like you're new hat.
Do you think he's gluten-free?
Okay, you're right. Americans are delusional. Let's eat
Are you going to help me fish for lifeguards or what?
Brought some lunch.
Lunch is so easy this time of year
He gets internship credit at law school. I get free chum.
For fifty bucks, you can ride a shark.
For another fifty, you can be eaten by a shark.
One on the fin is worth two on the beach.
He has a long-running television show that’s about to make no sense.
I’m saving him for my afternoon snack.
Ya I can play rough. But a little footsie is nice too.
These humans are literally giving me a headache!
I finally got the monkey off my back, now this!
I asked him to scratch my back.
I didn't read the fine print in that Contract with Kevin O'Leary.
I'm saving the bottom half for dessert.
It's only fair.  I ate his surfboard.
Ugh, his feet are freezing.
...it pays well
Yeah, I know the money isn't great, but at least working for Uber I get to set my own hours.
its only  temporary . he  just  broke  up  with  his girl._he'll be  gone  by Tuesday!
I'm a total magnet for humans.
Don't blame me.  It started as a pimple on my back.
That's not what I meant when I said get a backbone, Bob.
Honey, you hungry? I brought home the leftover drumsticks.
I'm conflicted...Am I Uber Ride Share or Uber food delivery ...?
He said he was hiding from a lone shark.
He took a thorn out of my paw.
Cause, he's Republican like me.
He was screaming and crying.  Then he gave up and started taunting me.  And I  lost my appetite.
Screw the friendly fish campaign. I wanna eat this guy.
I just can't bring myself to do it. It feels soooo good.
Can you imagine how many likes I'd get?
They taste better when they're healthy.
I've got mine, you get yours
You gotta let them think they're in charge.
Apparently jumping the shark is now passe.
Global warming!!!
I’m working PR for Animal Planet
Amuse-bouche?
Let's split it...one leg each.
Do you really think a mosquito could kill more humans than a shark! No one should even care about bug spray in summer!
It's take out dinner.
You want the other half? I'm full.
I know, I know. I'm too aggressive-passive.
Personally I prefer the breast.
He promised his kids if he can find them
I'm going to give him a few more minutes,  then it's lunch time.
Would you like to join me for lunch?
He says he's a remora.
Hey Sal, go up and see how fast this one can swim.
I can't, as much as I'd like to. He said he's a PETA agent and needed a Lyft.
Tell me again why we are doing this"
He’s watching out for people with hooks.
I threw him up and he's back.  Now what?
The chiropractor says two more weeks
I  just don’t think the free fish are worth it.
I just can’t shake the addiction ! They’re so delicious, but a bitch to clean !
I just feel a need to make some kind of amends.
I really miss our fridge.
Dinner cruise ...
I know our relationship is unhealthy, but it's nice to feel needed.
Obviously he hasn't seen Jaws"...
‘Have you seen my dinner?’
But I can't do it.  He's so clueless and trusting.
But I need this job to make fins meet.
It's great, I make extra money on my schedule and if you eat them at the end they can't give you a bad rating.
I just feel like maybe this politically correct thing is getting a little out of hand.
Guess we'll have to go a little deeper for privacy, dear.
Did you order dinner delivered?
It's this new thing called Uber.
Go for it—I'm more of a breast shark.
I’d eat him but he’s a vegan
No,I'm a bait white shark.
Noticed squirrels store acorns.
MSGA - Make Sharks Great Again!
We’re just messing with the Lifeguard

On the surface, it can be fairly unnoticeable, ...
He smells of pizza. I can’t handle Italian anymore!
We're shooting 'The Sponge Bob Jaws Movie.
Cuban's giving him a thrashing up there.
What?  He said he'd lure in some other swimmers if I didn't eat him.
All he said was "SUP." Care to join me?
Its Not pot luck?
He's too dumb to eat, probably be bitter.
He's my lookout for fin hunters.
Upper or lower?
I'm on a balanced diet.
Why?  Because supposedly surfers taste gnarly and bitter, that's why.
Does this mean we've been domesticated?
Maybe we should at least wait until his insurance kicks in?
keeping him around for a midnight snack....
He said he was the world’s greatest deal maker so I said, ‘Heads or tails?’
Oh, it's some kind of proverb, I'm sure.
Uber has expanded.
I don't have a fork.
You can have him if you want...not enough meat on the bones for me.
Just like an arrogant white guy -- can't stand on his own without the underclass.
I am really making good money as an Uber driver.
Marge said I needed to take my lunch to go.
You seen this guys wife?
I like mine half baked
I don't know how it happened but I can't stay still any longer.
I'm volunteering with Dins On Fins.
Yeah, I'm worried that he's gonna be COMPLETELY tasteless - just look at those boring shorts!
I had half for lunch, and I'm saving the rest for dinner.
He thinks we're friends. I'm waiting until he shows me off to the kids to strike.
Why do I always have to be your wing man?
I'm supposed to swallow him in the next scene but, to be honest, I don't have the stomach for it.
Evidently, he hasn't seen JAWS!
I don’t think he knows, but the massage feels great!
My dad thinks it’s hilarious when he puts food on my head.
Ooh!  He has pointy toes!
This is my camo hat— I wear it and people think it’s okay to swim out here. When somebody gets close enough, WAM, I read them my list of ways I would improve the last season of Game of Thrones by adding light elements of steampunk.
I'm trying to go vegan.
It’s all part of a balanced diet.
And I thought it was embarrasing when they were wearing crocs...
I’m hoping to attract one with a bit more meat on it.
Don't touch him, he's Swedish.
sooo not impressed with the swimming with humans at the resort, it's not the life changer I was expecting.
I can barely pay the fish monger with the cash this UBER Stand Up Board gig brings in.
He's trying to start a new sport called shark-surfing.  Let's just say the jury's still out.
Fuggedaboutit, I saw him first.
Do you want it over easy?
Uber is testing some new services. I prefer passengers over this food delivery though.
Mom told me about parasites,  but this is rediculous.
He thinks I’m giving him a ride home...
It's okay, he's The Fonz.
They were out of to-go containers.
I read that carrying the weight of an average human during my swim helps weight loss, but I can't resist eating those toes.
It turns out, I really like surfing.
You can have the rest. I lost my appetite when I got to the shorts.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t it your idea to order in tonight?
The idiot, I told him to walk on water, not on me!
Morally, I’m against the lifestyle.
But my back has never felt better.
Best back rub I ever had.
I  had no idea this was what pool shark meant.
Doing Uber is ok, but you need a phone that works underwater.
You suppose he'll yell "Hang five!" when I get through with him?
Nah, they’re too bony.
He called it a sharkskin suit.
Look at me:
I have a periscope and you don't; 
so there!
I heard they pay the other lifeguards $20 an hour
Can you get this guy off my back?
Synchronized Standing Competition
Speilberg cut this scene just before release!
He thinks he's Moses.
I'm brining him before I eat him.
Tourists pay better than scientists.
I don't know,I'm just not hungry.
Sure, Bob, I’ve had a spate of good luck - that doesn’t make it cheating.
Yeah, but this one claims he knows the casting director for the Jaws remake.
Are you okay with take-out?
It's all about the optics.
I thought I’d better bring my own lunch today.
The top was a little too rare for my taste.
What do you mean, what’s in it for you?
Just my luck, another lawyer.
They're texting.
It's a "take home" dinner.
I’m full of climate changers. You do it.
Do you want to pants him or should I?
Wait till he discovers he”s not standing in the shallows.
Don't you dare!
Pithy witticism.
Yeah, but have you seen the hair on his back?
Every now and then I like takeout...
It's not that deep; I can still touch bottom!
Dinner tonight? I've got too much for just me.
He's got chicken legs. I'll wait for the next one.
He said "professional courtesy". I want to bite him.
I know it's not much of role but "Companion Shark" was all they had for me today.
Look dear what I brought home for dinner!
If I do not get a good massage, I just eat him.
I would, but it actually feels kinda nice
Work-life balance — you should try it sometime.
Do you want to tell; or should I?
First it was sushi, now Ahiatsu massage, what's next?!
Quick, he thinks it's a sand bar.
It was your turn to swim the human.
I work for Scuber on the side.
Is this what they call "Surf and Turf"?
I order them for take-out.
Do you think it bites?
Yes I know, for 400 million years we were the undisputed apex predators, but pasty-leggs here is a cutthroat big Pharma lobbyist!
I'm going to wait until he eats the snack box on the beach.
...and then I just swim away, the '"sandbar" collapses, and you lunge!
Ever get tired of carry-out?
Don't let your food play with you.
I’m saving it for an afternoon snack.
If you can't eat em, join them!
Once I land my Netflix special I'll quit UberEats.
My agent told me if I took a surfboard gig I'd be able to grab bigger parts.
It’s worth it for the massage.
This dude thinks he’s windsurfing...
I'm waiting to see if the top-half is any more appetizing.
I’m his lawyer.
I don’t think so, but if it is Aquaman, I don’t want any trouble!
It pays the rent...
I can't. Just started paleo.
I don’t care what they say, this vegan diet really messes with the ecosystem.
I had a stint at SeaWorld.
He thinks all sharks are bottom feeders.
We have this deal.  He shows his friends he can walk on water, and then he carries me over to the kiddie pool.
There are some downsides to the gig economy but at least my schedule is flexible.
He said he would get me on Bay Watch
I would bite him, but I don't want to hurt his self-esteem."
I feel like a metaphor for the Mueller report.
Apparently it’s called “extreme” surfing
He has 5 seconds to get off my fin!
I just feel weighted down.
he said i could eat his brother if I gave him a ride
I always come here in July for spine therapy
I miss stand-up paddleboarding.

Fins don't cut it anymore, but social anxiety still keeps people far away
Please don't tell me I've got a monkey on my back!
Aqua-Uber
Back off, I've been carrying this appetizer for 10 minutes.
He won’t be able to keep his head above water in this economy.
This guy is so stupid, I could eat him standing on my head
It's just my side-hustle.
I  guess  the  swimmer  was   not  as  fast  as
I   thought!"
I asked for Swedish not Thai
Will you be paying with cash or credit?
He's outside of my HMO,  but what he does for dorsal pain is worth it's weight in seal.
Sharks love Uber Eats
He's great bait.
It doesn't seem fair, wouldn't you say?
He just thinks he hasn't gone off the deep end.
I liked it more when they were in the cages.
Leap, and the net will appear.
NO!! You cannot have lunch with him after he finishes my back massage!
I feed him minnows;  he keeps an eye out for shark fishermen.
And then they wonder why.
I'm trying out for Aqua-Uber, so don't even think about it!
I don't like this. It seems TOO easy.
It's called ashiatsu massage and all the sharks are doing it.
I felt bad for the kid, Jerry. Prom weekend and he couldn't afford a limo.
Simple. We bet, He won.

'Extreme surfing,  it's going to be the next big thing.'
Word to the wise: never lose a bet to Shamu
Well I win with the last man standing!
I decided to have my lunch to go today.
Actually, George, I'm swimming for a peer-to-peer ridesharing app called SurfSerfs.
It's this damn great white guilt.
Could be better than chicken fingers!
It causes way less chaos than a dorsal fin.
My therapist says this is good for me.
One of us. He's a loan shark.
I get nervous if I don't keep a little snack on me.
This growth ruins my chances with the seals
I save the drumsticks till last.
Skinny is still tasty.
I have your order for delivery...
Even the tourists found out Martha's got me on the kelp. I've been giving dorsal fin rides like I'm some kind of dolphin, all month.
I like them sunburnt!!
His hepatitis screen is pending.
You want him head first or feet first?
They're the only parts I'm really interested in.
What?! He had a great muffin top!
Would you believe, this is harder than it looks!
And if you stop moving, they'll give you a crappy review.
I signed up for "Swimming With the Humans" but I think he signed up for something too.
I saved the drumsticks for you.
Sometimes it's not easy to keep my food fresh.
Yeah, just until the end of August, then I start work with a big carporation.

No, it’s not a symbiotic relationship.
It’s portion control...I’ll eat the other half later.

Foot massage before dinner.
This would have to happen just when I start my diet.
He thinks I'm his paddle board.
I/m saving him for lunch.
Do you prefer a leg or a thigh?
I feel like I've lost some respect since I became a vegetarian.
He says it’s symbiotic, but I feel like he’s walking all over me.
I'd skip it. It tastes like chicken.
I can't get rid of this monkey.
The least he could do is cut his toenails.
This Uber surfing gig will pay for my trip to South Carolina this winter.
I'm not that hungry, do you want to split it?
The moron thinks he's standing on the bottom.
Want to make a wish?
It’s a collectable decoy.
Honey, there's something that's been weighing on my shoulders.
We can do lunch after my back massage
How long do you think until he realizes he's not on his paddle board anymore?
Improves the freshness and gets the blood pumping.
I brought my half, where's yours?
I saved you the drumsticks.
Said he forgot his surf board!
Just remember, these free rides pay for the groceries.
I invested in his business on Shark Tank last night
"He's only helping me with my back pain, Karen."
I have no idea where I'm going to install the Uber sign.
Let's flip for it.
He’s holding my phone.
It's a gig ocean.
It's the latest in gadgetry. A human periscope.
What’s really annoying is he keeps calling me ‘Mac.’
It’s supposed to help with the cravings.
Yep, well, many a truth is told in jest.
He’s all yours after my back rub.
Dinner winner, I called tails.
One day we’re going to look back at this and laugh.
He thinks he's the scorpion...
I like a good foot massage before dinner.
That was some party last night.
I'd eat him but he really helps me back!

It's been a long day, so I just ordered some takeout.
Picked up surfing as a hobby, but it's more of a headache than you realize

I was told around here it’s not illegal to use live bait
Can you imagine the expression on his face when he looks down and sees me?
Sorry but I don't like raw fishermen...
He calls it body surfing, but when he falls off I call it lunch.
He saved me from being finned. I'm saving him for lunch.

We'll eat after he finishes his terrific back massage."
He says he's honoring me by 'standing on the shoulders of greatness.'
He thinks he's playing Jump the Shark. I hope he tastes better than the last one.
You're going to need a bigger back.
I didn't expect driving for Uber Ocean to be this humiliating.
I told him I’d give him a lift if he debunked shark attacks as Fake News.
What can he be thinking?
Just a Big Pharma exec who needed a professional courtesy
Do these skinny legs make me look fat?
I'm vegetarian
I hate to burst his bubble.
It’s just in case I feel like a snack.
Watch what you sign. I assumed he was going to jump over me, not onto me.
I can't help it, he is a Republican.
I got community service for eating his surfboard.
He really gives a great foot massage.
Wishbone!

He thinks I’m a sandbar...
Oh that's John, he thinks he's a remora.
This one is playing hard to get.
They really are atop of the food chain?
It's s nice way to relax before meals.
You ordered UberEats?
I just prefer to have a masseur over a masseuse, Brian.
You hungry? I've got dinner on my mind.
Sure they taste great, but this guy gives a fantastic back rub
I can’t decide whether to eat him or just enjoy the massage.
Haven't you heard? Delayed gratification, man! It's the bomb.
It may be my fin, but it's gonna be his fin-ish.
Pret a Manger carry out
He told me this would be good for my root chakra, but I think I'd rather just eat him.
That explains it. I was wondering where the other half had gotten to.
I mean, standing on water won't make them think too much of him, right?
The world used to be on the back of a tortoise.
I don't know what it is got into me made me discover my compassionate nature somehow...
We have a working relationship.  He rubs my back.  I clean his feet.
It's Shiatsu.  I'm always sore after a feeding frenzy.

Whatever you do, don’t start your shift on an empty stomach.
He’s worse than a lamprey!
I’m waiting for my musical cue.
He grew tired of bucking broncos.
The last time I ate legs like that,I became a vegetarian.
Please say you will stay for dinner.
He says that if I support him it will improve our reputation.
They call me Uber shark
I don’t care what ‘shark chum’ is supposed to mean; he’s my friend!
I owe the local loan shark a favor.
He thinks I'm a stable genus.
Has he mistaken me for his Stand-up paddleboard?
It's what they call a foot massage.
If I keep this up Netflix will make a documentary about me
When his swimming lesson starts, I get first dibs.
He told me that since I prefer dark meat, he needed to get some sun!
It makes me more aquadynamic.
They say opposites attract.
At times, I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders....
I guess another one got his better half.
Ok, so it's not goat yoga.
Hang Ten?  How about Eat One
I think this species is learning to adapt...
The doctor says it’s just a cyst.
You've already had the other half.
Just play along. Dinner is later.
I'd been warned about picking up parasites in these waters.
Have you seen the guy on the surfboard?
Now I understand.
Quick ... before Secret Service shows up !
Uber is easy money—just sayin’.
Timing is everything.
Ecotourism pays the gills.
I know, I know; but he said 
he could get me on ‘Shark Tank’!
If your father sees you playing with humans again he’s going to bite your head off

It's all fake news ... the dumb lawyer jokes and the smart ass
dolphins. I'm doing this so they'll leave us and our fins alone.

Darilyn Bennett, Salem, Orego
I myself prefer the tail!
You actually have to admire his balance.
I like to give them a false sense of confidence.
Yeah, I like the aquatic stuff but these ashiatsu massages are wonderful!
I'm having it removed next week.
I knew those shark tracking apps would lead to no good!
Ashiatsu, followed by a protein snack, usually uplifts me from the slough of despond.
Another “Shark Tank” loser!
He said this is more environmental than the traditional surfboard.
I can't bite him.  I'm an Uber driver.
He just made partner.
UberOcean
I kind of think of him as a sharknerdo.
He also wears a pair of Crocs.
I’m with a hedge fund now -mostly serving as team metaphor and then doing some executive coaching for the guy standing on my back.
Third time this month I've been mistaken for a surfboard.
I'm with Uber Eats.
We just can't eat them all, can we?
I already ate the top half

Hammerhead? Pashaw!                                                                                                I've got an entire card-carrying union carpenter!
I just don't have the heart to tell him!
My wife said we’re going vegan.
This economy, am I right?
Keep your jaws off him. I'm saving him for dessert.
My dorsal was itchy.
I'm trying to avoid the bad press.
This is not what I meant when I said I needed a breather.
Last week I mistook his surf board for meal. I guess now it's his turn.
I’m not hungry, but this is too good of an opportunity to pass by.
It repels the remoras.
It’s my lunch, I’ll eat it at noon.
Best bait ever for Long Island Sound.
He found out it's Shark International Vegetarian Week
He kept humming this strange tune and saying he needed a bigger boat, do I decided what the heck, go all in."
Well you know what they say, “If you can’t eat ‘em adjoin ‘em”.
Don’t ask me!
He says it will rehabilitate our image and I get a week's engagement at SeaWorld.
Look what we have to constantly put up with.  And if I bite the kid, all of shark nation will be accused of inappropriate aggression.
David Fleischer, New York, NY
Is this a nightmare out of some movie or what?
Go On.   Just say "Polo"...
This guy thinks he's getting a submarine free ride!!
Sure I want to eat him, but I have to maintain my 4.8 rating.
It's been like this for an hour.
Would sir like some lemon with his legs?
It's the Surf 'n' Turf special.
Diets suck.
It's my new side hustle, Uber Surf.
He's a member of the Remora Union.
There’s not enough meat on those legs.
I don't know if I should eat him or rescind his pro-surfer's certificate.
You try eating him. I can't.
It's Uber's new service...finsharing.
I get him fish, he gets me poachers.
I can’t seem to get this monkey off my back,Stan.
One, two, three, flip.
What bothers me is that he thinks I'm a segway.
Next time, let me know when you're coming for dinner
I can't make out what he wants me to do. Submerge and he'll drown. Surface float and he'll get sunburned.
God, this neighborhood has become so gentrified.
I know you have the other half.
Modern times calls for modern invention, he's my periscope.
He doesn't like swimming so I'm his Uber-shark.
Did you know shark yoga was a thing?
Did you bring the Old Bay and butter?
It was this or becoming shark-skinned shoes.
I guess I can say good-bye to flaunting my dorsal fin.
I decided to pack lunch this week.
I know you're judging me right now, but I just don't think western medicine has all the answers.

Vegetarianism.
I’m making human leg soup.

Sam, would you get this guy off my back!
Gary here convinced me try intermittent fasting.
I had not choice -- they were out of the small size hood ornament
He thinks I'm his surfboard
Shall we toss him back in?
Remember this is an aquarium - eat him and there is no more
It's the latest - show your dorsal torso above the water line.
Wait till his check clears.
Not much of a symbiotic relationship eh?!
Yeah, athelete's foot sounds bad, but the doc says it's nothing more than a fun guy.
Don't look at me that way. Lyft is expanding and it's a job with a 401(k) plan.
Spielberg said I could audition for the Jaws reboot if I take him to Maui.
I’m on a nylon-free diet this summer.
Wanna join me and my chum for take out?
Standing on, as opposed to jumping the, implying hopeless idiocy is actually strategic . . ..
I lost a BAD bet damn it!!
Get this guy off my back please.
I'm supposed to wait until he says, "OK, boy!"
Listen...I’ve been getting cold feet...”
He's my shiatsu therapist.  I picked him up off the coast of Japan.
Actually, I'm waiting until dinner time.
They taste too un-fishy. Besides, where else can you get a massage?
This is yet another example of why it's important to read the fine print.
This is just getting too easy.
You’ll get your sea legs someday.
I like to relax them before I eat them.
Dude I’m tellin’ ya, if you need a few extra clams, check out UberAqua. This guy ordered a Great UberWHITE so I got a sonar ping. Once I drop him off, I pocket a couple fins. It’s the beginning of a beautiful symbiotic relationship.
I feel offended when people say I have a chip on my shoulder.
It’s sort of like having a monkey on your back
My doc tells me that I have a delusional idea that I’m a lamp base.
What do you mean you 'went vegan'?
Because a real periscope costs an arm and a leg.
I have a foot fetish.
He’s my first passenger. It’s an app called Grouper.
He gave an amazing pitch for his invention, and I can’t help but support him.
I said that if he lures in four others for me, he gets to walk away.
I picked up a side gig driving for Dryft and Tuber.
It's touching me!
That'll be 10 dollars sir, and thank you for choosing Scuba Eats.
Now what do I do?
I have to keep moving or else he'll die.
I've found surfing is a good way to eat people.
Professional courtesy. Personal injury lawyer.
I think this is what the humans call hitchhiking, or is it surfing?
You can't say I never bring you a tasty dinner
It's not the weight, it's the smell of those feet!
You order Door Dash?
Don't ask me to break my agreement with Uber.
It’s called Shuber and they say it’s going to be very disruptive.
He says he won't indict me if he doesn't have a leg to stand on.
Can you help me?
Don't judge me. I'm using my discounted massage Groupon.
He was a loser on Shark Tank
Talk about lazy. Won't even swim.
What one has to do just to get a meal!
My therapist says I need to be ok with the fact that some people are going to walk all over me.
If he pees, I want overtime.
He agreed to be my lure for bigger people.
It’s a swim-sharing service. You’ll never guess where I got an investor. And if my rider leaves a bad review, I eat them.

Surfer à la mode.
lets show him some real shark fin soup
About 80,000 calories, wanna split it?
I saved half for leftovers.
Has this ever happened to you? I'm cruising the surface checking out the surfers and this guy jumps off his surf board and onto my back.
I wish he'd just jump already.
Can you please just not get so much blood in my eyes this time?
We’re both trying to be more green.
Do I look like a dolphin to you?
Ashiatsu AF

It'll be great. They enter our tank to pitch ideas...
I don’t know how this marriage is going to work if you don’t respect my hobbies.
And you wondered why we have this sandy skin.....
He' s refusing to pet us today. So, what's eating at him
There's on right on top of me, isn't there?
He tried to jump the shark, but it didn't work.
It's the latest fad.  Foot message before you eat.
Decent wage, doo doo doo doo doo doo"
He'll only give me three stars unless I take him right up to the beach.
The things they make you do when it’s not shark week.
He is asserting his white male privilege.
It's a new lure I'm using.
Mixed us up again with the tv show, but you’d think they’d at least come up with something useful for us for a change !
I mean as if the tagging wasn't bad enough.
It was a trade-off to keep my fins.
Sometimes I do it for Uber, sometimes for Uber Eats.
He thinks if he doesn't move I won't eat him!
Yeah, it’s stylish as hats go, but it gives me such a headache.
Speak of clueless.
He thinks he's being funny.
Not to worry about eating those legs. They're Donald Trump's... and you know they're filled with hormones, gluten, saturated fat and plastic.
I know, I know... stringy and get caught in your teeth... but nothing else was open.
We could flip for him.
Don't you hate it that our reputation of being man eaters has been killed by the National Geographic Channel.
It's Conceptual Art and helps with my dieting,I can only chew little pieces while it stands on my head

I actually feel sorry for him.
I’m getting a headache. It’s your turn to cruise around with the decoy.

It's Keto friendly.
As a lawyer, he's great at spotting a new "client".
I know. I just can't help it. I'm co-dependent.
He said his name is POTUS and I am supposed to take him to my leader... I figured if I ate him it might impact my intelligence.
I don't care, I'm keeping him!
I know it looks silly, but I'm just playing along until it's my lunch time.
Then they will wonder why you bit his legs off.
You take him I just don't have the heart to do it
I thought I was tired of being seen as dangerous, but now I just have a headache.
Yours or mine?
I told you lunch would be on me!
I’m working for the new water taxi service, SCUBER.
He doesn't realize he lost his paddleboard.
I'm not even making Minimum on this ride, but at least they let me bring home food.
They sign up for free shark rides...and then we eat 'em.
I'm starting to get kinda fond of the little guy
The goat wasn’t available.
Don’t even think about it!  He belongs to me!
Do you think he will jump the shark?
I had been doing so much better with my enabling and co-dependency issues. But I think maybe I need to start seeing my therapist again.

It's good for my core.
I get the legs
I've changed a lot since my evil days as "Jaws".
The best I could manage is a visual decoy.  We are still working on a human call.
No, we eat him after he finishes the massage.
It’s worth the wait.  If he actually gets a bigger boat we sink it and eat them all.
We get no respect since that damn song hit YouTube.
My therapist says you carry your emotional baggage in your dorsal fin spine. Honestly I thought it was a lot of hoo hah but lately I really feel it. The break up, climate change, my mother, all of it.  Right in that spot. Just like, ugh! Baggage!
This one's heavy. Take a bite off for me?
This guy thinks I am one of those new powered surfboards.
Watch this. It's my version of the "treat on the nose trick."
Moonlighting for Uber. Why do you ask?
My Anger Management class suggests de-escalation but maybe submerging would be better.
If it digs in its toenails one more time I’m going to eat it.

Don’t eat anything he gives you that’s attached to a hook!
I hate it when the Dolphin Encounter gets all booked up.
Blessing in disguise! 
This Handsome Meal asked me for a Lift
Really, I guess it comes down to your definition of "apex".
I was saving some for later, but I can’t remember where I put the rest of him
Trust me, it's weirder for me than it is for you.
I can't hurt him until he sees that he's in danger. You know, like in the old cartoons. Trust me, it'll be hilarious when he finally looks down here and I can eat him.
I don't know how much longer I can wait here until I have lunch.
No thanks. I brought my lunch.
now:SMILE!
I really don't mind. It keeps me settled.
Hey, wanna join the finitching school?
Dude, this massage is dooope.
Careful, these waters are leg-infested.
I usually prefer Swedish but this shiatsu isn't bad.
He can’t swim; plus he paid me lots of money to promise not to tell anyone.
Order's up.
If they don’t give me five stars, I eat them.
You gotta help me get this monkey off my back!
I owe him since I broke his surfboard.
So, how long do we have to play sand bar to a bunch of edible tourists?
I’m too committed at this point so, no, I won’t go to dinner with you.
Should've voted for Beto.
The upper portion was yummy
What can I say?  it’s a living.
And I'm telling you: It's my turn now. He's been doing you for nearly an hour.
They don't do delivery in my zip code
I can’t believe you DON’T have one, Trevor. It’s the latest fashion.
I bit off his toes last summer and my conscience got the best of me.  Now I ride him around the bay so he can impress his friends."
I'll flip him. Heads you get um, tails he's mine.
I'd ask you to spell me for awhile, but I'm afraid we're *all* sort of supporting them.
75/25 or I’m outta here!
I know, I know. But the price was surging, I had to take the fare.
Do you ever feel like the man is holding you down?
I’m just happy that this idiot doesn’t know what happened the last person who thought I was a dolphin
I’m saving him for tomorrow
It's something like Uber for swimmers. Pretty good pay, but they fire you if you eat a passenger.
"Without the music, I get no respect"
It's sort of like Custers stand.
Notes of gym sock infuse the robust bouquet of toe jam.
They were all out of jumbo.
The lengths I have to go to get a good Ashiatsu massage!
Lyft was looking for divers and I needed the chub change
I like the whole massage aspect of it, but I'm getting hungry.
Got any ideas how I break it to him that I'm not a sand bar?


-- D. Parker, San Francisco
He says its a symbiotic relationship, but I'd have to dive to test that.
He thinks he's on solid ground, but in a minute he won't have a leg to stand on.
It's the gig economy, stupid!
You just wait, its a little trick i learned from them
I lost a bet. For now.
But it feels so good.
How do you do, fellow shark?
Yes, I decided to go to work for "Shark-Uber."
If he sings "Baby Shark" one more time... 
I'm going to bite his Great White legs off.
He paid me a fin to do this.
Heads up, this guy is a bit peeved by the transfer delay.
What some people won’t do to look taller.
Sorry, I forgot the milk.
Do you hear music?
Delivery?
Shark surfing is trending.  You free for dinner?
There's a sous-vide frenzy right now
I was gonna eat em', but look at those toenails! Yeesh!
No, this is our new food delivery platform that makes getting great food as easy as getting a ride.
Do you remember, when I told you my new cleaner fish is a bit different?
He said his name was Fonzarelli.
Sure, it's just like those other ride-share services, but in addition to earning a few extra bucks I can eat the day's last fare.
I thought a marinade might be nice.
I got 50% equity.
We need to hire an  Reputation Management Agency, we’re getting no respect.

He's having a word with my upstairs neighbor.
Freeloader.....Free Lunch!
He thinks I'm his surfboard.
I'm just waiting to poop and get my appetite back.
If he doesn't get off, I'm joining the Sharknado.
Hey, we're friends. He's just a chum
Daddy Shark, what should I do-do-do-do-do-do?
He thinks it’s a cheap ride, but wait until he finds out about surge pricing.
Human yoga.
I get why no one visits Greenwich
I’m starting to rethink my “friends not food” mantra.
Oh, he is so gonna get the shark and awe treatment.

Yea it’s a lot of extra swimming but I get to eat a lot of interesting people.
I have an itch I can't scratch.
He gives a pretty good back massage.
It’s new business- 
a ride sharing.
He’s looking for us!

Stop playing with your food
Then he said, “jump the shark!”
He thinks I’m a rabbit
Yup. I know... "shark boarding". What's next?
I can’t get this guy off my back!
I don’t know!  He said he voted for HRC and I guess I felt sorry for him.
Looks like daddy shark do do do do is the winner.
Uber is everywhere.
Man, that damn 'Shark Tale" movie really killed our street cred.
Can you scratch my back? It feels itchy.
Somehow, I'm getting the loveliest back message.
He plays a great "Jaws" theme on his tuba.
No there isn’t.
Overheard at the sandbar; “Cheers, this one’s on me!”
He still thinks he's in the kitty pool.
He's a real pain in the back.
Sure, I get hungry. But this is the only relief I can get for my chronic backache.
I know, but it beats being an Uber driver.
Ugh, millenials! Am I right?
They’re a lot more confident since “Finding Nemo”
He thinks he's standing on the bottom. How do I break the news?
I’m considering a bold statement about my participation in these new encounter pools.
If you keep your fin underwater, I'll split him with you.
The pay is lousy, but it’s the only summer job I could get.
First the ashiatsu; then the meal.
When do you want dinner?

Wait till he posts a few selfies.
We bonded at Seaworld.
Don't eat him. I want to keep my five-star rating.
It’s heavy, but it’s a find.
Don’t move. It’s Damien Hirst.
I'm really sorry but he makes my tail wiggle.
I'm not distracted, I've just got a lot on my mind.
There’s no medical, but I get to work my own hours.
I thought during the closed season I could make some money from this Uber thing, at least.
I guess it takes a couple of seasons to work up to jumping.

Don't you just hate it, when people walk all over you
Terry swears they’re more tender when they don’t see it coming.

It's distantly related to having a monkey on your back.
The remora has the weekend off.
SMS: Shark Massage Service
My doctor put me on a no-Republican diet
It's a stupid human trick.
He's insisting I nibble on his feet — something about a pedicure.
Here's your Uber Eats lunch delivery.
I'm making Uber money...carol wants a fin job
The monkey on my back evolved.
You want to tell him I'm not his surfboard, or should I?
It’s Sir Isaac Newton. He thinks I’m a giant.
Enough is enough! If you don't eat him, I will!
I was going to eat him but it’s a waist.
Doesn’t he know I’m a lemon?
I said we'd split dinner. I got my half - Yours seems to have swum away... Sorry.
No need for a credit card, we have that on file!  Enjoy your dinner!
Please tell me it’s not an white man.
Go ahead and munch.  They taste like chicken!
Talk about being drunk to the gills.
It does not weigh as much on your conscience if it’s happy meat.
The only parascope  I could find, on short notice.
And it's Miami Beach so he's still paying $6,000 a month
You can have him. It's hardly an appetizer.
I'm really not a fan of body-surfing
Remember, we talked about sharing. I'll slowly dro...
Stop circling and do me and the rest of the world a favor!”
We could have him for lunch, but then Uber might fire me.
Want to try a leg of lamb?
My father always told me I was a shoe.
It's a useful prop.
I like a little ashiatsu before lunch.
I call it UUber;  Underwater Uber.
I know I should bite his leg off, and I will as soon as he’s finished this amazing massage.
So you're the left shark that messed everything up at the Superbowl huh?  Humans are still riding this four years later...
It's the new Uber and it doesn't matter if the riders disappear.
Professional courtesy - he
Long story short: he pulled a thorn out of my paw.
OK, we can share, but he's kinda skinny so I get the first bite.
I'm an Uber Diver now.
I’m waiting tables until I hear back about that role I’m up for in the next “Jaws” sequel
You want my leftovers?
But when you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way.
God I wish I was a piranha!
He's such a dick.
I hope he's a good tipper.
The trick is not to rush.  Soon, more will come.
He’s my service human.
I think he said something about ‘jumping.’
It's a new Uber service. Helps pay the bills.
When I was told that I was going surfing, this was not what I had in mind.
I feel bad for surfboards.
I'm always on the lookout for a balanced meal.
I thought volunteer work would be easy
The koi say it’s big where they’re from, but frankly I’m just not feeling it.
Uber is expanding again.
He's my therapist. Weird as it sounds, my back does feel better.
First picture of Uber's expansion into ocean travel.
Before I rectify this situation, doesn’t it remind you of the old shark-lawyer-professional courtesy joke?
It was only supposed to be a part time gig.
They're calling it "sharking."
Coming unprepared to the Shark Tank, yet expecting help?
He’ll soon not have a leg to stand on!
HEAVY meal ahead!"
Not yet, I’m waiting till he turns 18.
Is it me, or do they seem preoccupied lately ?
Kevin Collins, Cleveland, Ohio
All odds aside, this guy is pushing it.
It's the new rideshare, 'Unter'.
Don’t move, looks like you’ve picked up a parasite
He’s ours! Just play good carp.. ..bad carp
"My mother tried to explain 'hubris' to me. 
The only thing I understood was that you can't eat it."
These mandatory lunch breaks are killing me.
Never bet someone who bets a shark!
He's showing me how to be an apex predator.
Of course I'm chagrined.
He thinks he's a remora.
It’s pronounced “ah-shee-at-soo”
Go ahead! It's a chewable life vest.
I love him, but I'm tired of doing all the heavy lifting in our relationship
He’ll be fine. I prefer Manhattan Chowder over New England.
Lucky for him my parents put me through Charm School.
If he yells 'Cowabunga' one more time, I'm quitting.
I see this as a glass half empty/glass half full dilemma.
I can't eat him. I need the five star reviews.
Have you seen my saddle?
Shark yoga. Beats chasing seals for a living.
You know the old saying, Monkey on your back?
I know we don't normally get aggressive, but this guy is pissing me off.
Humans are friends, not food.
I was always told that we were on top of the food 
chain.
Like my new hood ornament?
I wish he'd get off my back about Shark Week.
Let’s take a deep dive and see if he can tread water.
Back off, I’m his surf board!
Have you ever lost your appetite for no good reason?
He’s looking for investors
It’s called Ashiatsu, a Japanese form of deep tissue foot massage, seeking to balance the yin and the yang..
Let's do lunch—the treat's on me!
My chiropractor recommended it.
I liked it better when they were afraid of us.
It's a new form of massage..."Shiarktsu"
I am Aquaman’s personal chauffeur, not an Uber driver.
I know this is beneath me but Spielberg promised me a SAG card.
Ok, I know the Sharks aren't the killers we think they are campaign is working well, but this is taking out too far.
But the water is warmer over here.
Yo bro, am I dreaming or is there some white dude standing on my head.
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo...
Technically I'm an Uber Pool independent contractor.
Shall we tell him first, or just...?
Well, at least I'm employed.
I told you that you were shallow.
My Physical Therapist says I need this 30 minutes a day for the next 3 weeks.
You've heard of goat yoga?  Well, this is as close as I could get.
It's some kind of selfie thing.
I'm saving this one for desert.
You've heard of having an albatross around your neck, well, ..."
I owe him a paddle board
Nah, brah... this helps both of us get chicks.
Let's wait for someone to come along to save this one! He feels too light to be a tasty treat!
All I hear is blah blah blah....
Jaws” therap
uber made me an offer I couldnt refuse
I know it looks weird but you wouldn’t believe it’s a reception
His toenails need trimming.
Don't look at me that way.  It's the latest thing - I thought I'd try it.
Mine's to go.
The best he can do is 24.99% APR.
We can't keep meeting like this. I just can't do it to Stan - he's in such a vulnerable place right now.
Time to mingle and get a bite to eat.
I'm picking up some extra cash being an Uber-swimmer.
Of course this will work!”
If we eat him now, we will have to spend an hour without swimming later
Do I have food on my face?
It's community service
It’s called Uber.
I'm getting bikini-ready for the summer.
This new ride-sharing job really helps put food on my table.
Ashiatsu. Works out my aggressions.
There's something gross on my back isn't there? 
C'mon, what is it!? Glen, get it off me!
Please, Glen?
Since becoming a vegetarian I've been making a living as a surf board.
This is what's left over.
It's a new business venture. Uber,but for surfers.
Sure, but when one of us mistakes a surfboard for a seal, all hell breaks loose.
I'm saving the rest for the NBA Finals
Say Finny
With that global warming I feel like eating salad only.
It is important that you  accept  what  the  deer and the antelope played at  on the range!
I don't think this is what JFK meant when he said, "A rising tide lifts all boats."
Sorry, a couple of  heels held me up.
It’s called massage.
He's paying me in exposure.
I can't stand these bloody humans, mate!
Too soon...
Because they were out of top hats.
Did you see the top half anywhere?
This is why I'm hoping a Jaws reboot gets greenlit
How about a casual lunch?
It's a new community initiative
The future of transportation is ridesharking.
It helps him feel taller.
I'm trying to make up for all the bad rap we've gotten since that horrid movie with Richard Dreyfus, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw.
Wait until he realizes I'm not a sandbar!
Jumped the shark?  That's a thing.  Jumped on the shark, not so much.
He mentioned something about white privilege, and I don't even know what that is. Yet, here we are.
Sure it's annoying, but I'll take it over dealing with my kids.
Maybe I was a dolphin in my past life!
It's new bait to fish for humans.
Good morning. Old chum.
Care for an hors d'oeuvre?
It’s the opposite of stepping on a Lego
To bite or not to bit , that is the question?
Can you help? I seem to have misplaced my lunch.
What are you doing after dinner?
Times like these make it almost impossible to keep up my juice cleanse.
The woman he was with was actually quite tasty.
Hurry and take a pic for my Instagram page!
I'd rather have plastic
It doesn't pay much, but every little bit helps.
What are you looking at? Human bait is the new cologne.
He knows about our affair and demands payment in bitcoins.
I'd eat him, but it's so hard to find a good shiatsu practitioner and he knows just the right pressure point on my dorsal.
Ashi-ark-su
He will give me food if I take him across the Pacific
I reached my quota for attacking humans this summer.
Man to Man.  You lose!
I'm not really sure what it is, but Kevin said it tastes like chicken.
That’s right, I invited you to come meet my chum.
Let’s eat him Dave, he’s not gonna stand around on me forever,plus my back hurts.
Careful, he's dangerous.
He wants to compete but can't afford a surfboard
``Knock yourself out.''
Ugh I know but we now live in a gig economy.
I'm still top of the food chain, Frank. Yes, they call for a ride on the app, but I get to decide if I want to accept it.
I'm not sure why I keep him. He does like sardines, though.
I'll never do this Salomon Brothers internship thing again.
I like the President's confidence. Let's count to 3 and ...
I try to do my bit for species preservation, especially when I'm not hungry.
Go on 3. 1 2 ...
He's no George Jefferson. But he'll do for now.
The wife told me to bring something home.
Doesn’t he know what we represent!
He scratches my back...or I eat his
You win heads, I win tails.
The other kids laugh at him if he uses floaties.
A stand in for JAWS
You up for a chicken fight? Winner eats all.
I finally got the monkey off my back and now this homosapien is causing me grief!
Looks like they're making another Happy Days spin-off
Don't you dare. He's scratching where it itches.
Ugh I’ve got snort-I mean legs sticking on by the snort that slips down your spine all wriggly like how’s the kids?
Don't let this get around.
Surf’s down.
I can’t, I’m full.
Now I hope this will teach you never to bite inflatable whales you don’t know!
We have sunk so low.
Let me finish rehearsing for my audition at Sea World first.
This time, forget about the deep-fried wings and keep it simple. The left leg is yours and the right is mine.
You can have him, I just had lunch.
Don’t look up, Frank.
The Lord is testing our commitment to Veganuary.
This deep tissue massage is great at increasing blood flow, relaxing my back muscles, and releasing stress!
Just when you thought it was safe to go onto the sand bar...
It started off as a wart
ewwwmooommmmm! getitoffgetitoffgeitofffffff!!!
Does he understand?
It's a great gig.  Uber Waterways lets us join the labor pool.
He's an apex predator. What else am I supposed to do?
These new requirements from Uber and Lyft are getting too much for me
I thought I was tough but lately, I've been letting people walk all over me
They have it bad enough up there already
I feel guilty, he looked so happy when he stepped "on that stone".
Baby shark kids all grown now!
I have to take these leftovers home for the newborn.
I know it's an aquarium, but I'm hungry.
I like to mess with them a little before I take a bite.
Three is a crowd.
I think it's high time we make a movie about how humans have stood on us for years. They make plenty of movies about us.
I’m getting tired of these lawyers.
You want me to eat him for you, too?
But I just turned vegetarian!’
Catherine Burgess
Somerville M
A new plastic free thrill. You'll see, it's a win win!
I found him on a German message board.
What do you think, Marge? I picked it at Jaws's Secret; they had a special on head wear."
I’ll hurl him up hard and you surface with jaws open.  He’ll never know what hit him.
It's not a bad gig. I take him fishing, then take home 40% of what he catches.
The minute I go plant-based...
I’m going topless.
Keep his head above water.”  But Bruce, what about our nature?
It's my turn to have the top portion.
This is different?
You're right, he's going to owe me one.
I ate his surfboard, and he said this was only fair.
Yes, I've heard of  'jumping the shark'; but 'on the shark'? Reality show desperation if you ask me.
Animal, vegetable, or optometrist?
It’s similar to a monkey on my back but easier to get off.
He’s light. The pay is good. He might have a friend for you.
How was I supposed to know he was Neptune’s nephew?
Seriously, how did we manage before Instagram?
Just waiting for him to coax in the Mrs.  That's when
they learn there's no free ride.
I told you I'd get rven
Who the hell is William Tell?
They are not a very intelligent species.
Finally, the appetizers are here!
The orcas have given up. It's our time to shine!
He makes a great lure.
Yes, yes, I know, I've got a human on my back...what's new with you?
You just bribe the skinny ones to lookout for the chubby ones.
He taps his foot twice when
Wait! I can still feel some neck tension.
Kowabunga, dude!
I decided to the the ride sharing thing a try
I saved the dark meat for you.
I'm a level 5 vegan.
Really? You think the bowler worked better?
This guy thinks he called an Uber.
Can you give me a lift?
Apparently, more environmentally friendly than speed boats
Tuna is a peer-to-shark transport network
Honey, it was an accident.
Are you sure this is an outstanding meal?
I really want to eat him!
Wait knuckling it ‘til my gig’s done at Sea World
It's Michael Ovitz...I'm helping him with his comeback
Humans endangered species? You must be joking!
He's got ID showing he's a remora, but so far no benefit
An itch I juts can't reach.
I just feel like he weighs me down, you know?
I picked him up off Cape Town. He thinks i'm taking him to New York.
Open wide and I will flip him!
It's called a foot massage, Phil. Like you've never had one.
I've been swimming for Swyft a few months now, and posting reviews of my clients on Gulp.
At least I didn't eat my human!
Heads he's yours.  Tails he's mine.
I thought I'd pack a lunch for the beach.
He'd LIKE to walk on water, but I hate getting that close to the surface . . .
I only do Uber on the weekends.
What do I do? What do I do? He tried to jump the shark and missed.
Honestly it's called a massage
I am a stand in for Shark Week
Toenail fungus relieves the sonar headaches
He says he needs to "get his feet wet" before he tries to "jump" the shark. Whatever that means.
You haven't heard? It's Uber's latest gig.
Its a new sensor I am trying out
I just can’t wrap my head around this!
Yeah, been driving for seaUBER for a month now.
They tell me it works with ducks.
Swimming with the dolphins is out.
Dude, make him hang five
That’s what happens when you get too friendly with them
I told him and told him, but he just won't listen.
8.25 isn't enough to have the customers just walk all over you.
I"m saving the last one for later.
They really need to re-release Jaws on the big screen.
I got it to attract swimmers.  If you get one, have a blowfish inflate it!
I brought you a snack.
No, I'm actually a hammer toe
I knew the Uber concept wouldn't work down here
Sometimes being a vegetarian is difficult
He is not my soul brother.
I heard this will help with the knots in my cartilage.
Don’t be salty, I told you I was poly.
Shhh! He thinks he’s standing on a rock.
I already ate his surf board.
No, really! The guy in the white coat said  if I hold off for 15 minutes, I can have two.
They call it 'shurfing.'
Clean Up the Ocean" tours aren't going as planned
I thought a foot massage would be more relaxing.
It's the finals
Damned if I know,but I did hear someone call him Fonz.
I like to take my snacks along with me
So when I roll, grab his leg...
Yes, fine, but what I asked you is, "Do I have something in my teeth?"
It was floating around Plastic Island - a throw away from "Jaws". I call him 'Bruce'.
But I just had a big breakfast!
Get the net ready, here they come.
I'm afraid this one is shaken, not stirred.
Yeh, I know it looks weird.  But he asked nicely and, you know, I couldn't say no.  Anyway, if he is going to be some sort of Grand Poobah he will have to learn how to swim with us.
Why?  What do you use as bait?
He just had to prove he was on top of the food chain.
If I don't encourage and support him, he punches me right on the nose!
He said if I hold him up he can tell me what the weather's like.
He pays me scale.
I can't be bothered
I wanted a massage and you said no!
Embarrassed, this is nothing, you should see me when I have to pull the kids around!
I'll have the rest of him for lunch
when you say goodbye and then both end up walking in the same direction
Carl and I agreed to share, so he took the top half.
I thought being an Uber-predator would have been more exciting.
I'm keeping an eye on that undertoe.
I am a photographer. Food delivery is just a way of making a little extra.
It looked a lot easier in “Jaws.”
The gig economy is hell on my back.
Do you want to take this one?
I'm under foot. Can you give me a hand?
Look away!
I hate surfers.
Well, it pays better than Uber."
So I get $15/hr plus tips...not a bad gig these days
I thought swimming for Uber would be a good idea but these humans keep using my skin to scrape the callouses off their feet!
These massages just aren't doing anything for my stress anymore.
Climate change killed my remora, and this clown's house is underwater, but he doesn't eat the scraps.
The poor guy couldn't get an Uber.
He thinks he's one of us - but he's just a flippin' lawer!
You take him I ate his surf board.
That’ll be $22.50 plus tip.
This guy says we are under arrest for being loan sharks.
I told you that we do our food delivery on time.
........or do you prefer chocolate?
Here’s how we’re different, Carl..
I would rather have a slow and steady bucket of sardines after every ride.
He doesn't know he's not close to shore.
First it was just incessant singing, now a movie adaptation? I don’t know, Mama Shark... what should we doot-do-do-doot-doot-do-do-do...?
Top half was chewy.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
My second cousin was a dolphin.
That's what happens when you go vegan.
I'm becoming a vegetarian and BTW he gives a good back massage.
I've felt so disrespected since the end of Shark Week.
I'm a service shark and if he doesn't like my service I'll just eat him.
He's my first Uber passenger.
He thinks he's on a park ride. My concept, lunch to go.
If I can't see him, I won't eat him.
He wants to ride the Gulf Stream before the Arctic thaws.
Jerry? Is that you? I didn't know you were driving for Uber now.
A little bit higher.... ahhhh!
Don't even think it...or you're shark bait!
I swear the Groupon said couples massage.
So you're sayin' he made up the whole symbiosis thing.
Can you believe it? This guy keeps saying global warming is not a thing... this used to be his living room!
Do I look like a surfboard?
I saved you half
Frank thought it would be funny if I had to wear it tonight for the bachelor party.
He must be a Republican
Whatever I just ate tastes like styrofoam
Do you have any hot sauce?
Surf's Up???
I brought you dinner.
I get the feeling I've been stood up.
I just figured we were going the same way...
Uber's not all it's cracked up to be.
Don't you try to shame me into sharing just because you forgot to pack a lunch.
They call him the shark whisperer.
Looks like we're gonna need a bigger ocean
Uber water rides are my side hustle plus if I get really hungry I can have a snack.
I invited him out for dinner.  He said he has to fix his hair.
Change our image for the tourist season, you said. And this is what you come up with!
It started as a growth on my dorsal fin.
The smart money is on 30 seconds before he realizes I'm not a surfboard.
This th-thing is c-c-cold.
Not sure this ride sharing business is really worth it!
Life is moving by pretty fast at my age, I’m just trying to slow down, not stop of course, and smell the roses
I asked for the leading man but got his stand-in.
Well at least it's not a monkey.
I'm saving it for a snack later!
Say what you will, but I believe finding a friend trumps finding a meal.
For my birthday I wished to grow another 2 feet.
His business plan shark tanked!
Don't bother. It probably tastes worse than it smells.
Beep beep, George. It's peak hours.
He has no clue he is standing on sharkey ground.
He has me on retainer.
He's a verified rider and I could use the money.
A tale of two heads.
You wanna go get something to eat
You're complaining to me about a load on your shoulders?
I'm saving the other half for a snack.
Don't even think about it, Steve. He gives the best massages.
Yeah, he thinks he’s standing on a sandbar.
I now identify as an emotional support Selachimorpha.
Now I understand what living at Sea World feels like
The real trick is to lull them into complacency.
To tell you the truth, I enjoyed my time as a surfboard a whole lot more!
Yeah ... he’s the Good  Humor dude ... popsicle legs.
Ever Since I signed on with Uber, I've gotten all these strange requests...Do you have any idea where "Times Square" is?
We get a bad reputation when we react to a stunt like this.
I'm on a strict diet but there's a hunger weighing me down.
I think I‘m having a long lasting sleep paralysis...
Should I rock the boat on his free ride?
He's a high maintenance periscope.
So much for biomimicry, he knows there is nothing like the real thing.
Do you think another one of these hackneyed leadership survival guides hit the bestseller list?
We don't get paid unless he wins.
It's like Uber, but for surfboards.
The treats were just too tempting.
Why don't we Eskimo kiss and move on
Oh, that’s Finn.
If you are interested, the top 1/2 is a short swim behind me.
It's much more fun once you go vegan!
I'm just not hungry
You can't see it but he's top heavy.
This way I burn off 300 calories before dinner.
Gillbert: He keeps singing "Baby shark, doo doo doo doo" every time I pass by. 
Jawshua: Humans - think they own "everything!"
With the diminishing food supply, I took a gig with Uber.
My agent controls book rights for Aesop's fables so he packaged us in.
He's my dentist. I have bills.
He's taking testing the waters to a new level.
So, okay, Mom, I turned Vegan - you gonna tell Dad?
Do you want the top or bottom half this time?
Technically it's cartilage
If you turn this upside-down, YOU'RE impossible!
I know, right?  Fear-induced immobility was supposed to be our thing.
He's a vegan.  He promised to lure meat eaters out here if I did;t eat him.
Its the latest in camouflage technology, its supposed to allow you to get right up close to those unsuspecting swimmers !
I disrupting ocean travel.
Swimming with dolphins was one thing, but surfing with sharks...?
My Broker says the housing market is getting weak.
I'm just not feeling respected
It’s a brand thing:  deep-six that stigma of “A shark of lawyers” with “A stand of sharks.”
Are you going to date him or eat him...
We lost in surfboard litigation
He still thinks I'm Flipper.
I'm into the new sharing economy. Want a piece?
Whoever said these were shark infested waters is wrong Dad.
I know, but I have a bad toothache.
This court dismisses pulling a rabbit out of a hat as evidence
Don't you just hate it when you can't reach that last bit you your lunch?
Yeah, life hasn't been the same since I signed with Suber
Bait and switch.
Could you speak up? There's a guy stepping on my ears.
What?  Do I have a piece of human caught between my teeth?
Uber Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Uber Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
I swallowed the surf board, but how did I miss the surfer?!?
We're trying out for a new reality show.
Why do you think they call us Sand Sharks?
Tell me when he moves. I'm hungry.
My treat.
Remember "the Fonz?"  Well, he tried it again!
I told you not eat so fast!
Would you like a roll of toilet paper?
I think I found the cure for my ennui. Shall we?
I feel so guilty--I devoured his surf board.
I like a good back massage before dinner.
I'm baking the rest.
I've got a lot on my mind.
When are they going to remake Jaws? This is getting ridiculous.
Do you want to tell him, or should I?
It's being widely reported as another great white supremacist sighting.
Yeah, shark surfing. It's a living.
Sentencing for biting surfboards is getting tougher.
‘This foot crisis is weighing me down.’
'I thought you said he was supposed to jump'.
He gives great massages. To bad i will have him for dinner.
I'm between jobs at the moment, but this Grubhub gig isn't too bad.
Best dorsal massage in the ocean.
How come I always get the lower half?
My chiropractor recommend this
Where's baby shark?
He brings me all the krill I can eat. If he ever stops, we’ll ...
My wife said Phinn is supposed to help me be a little more discrete in public.
This was not my dream.
I got a Monkey on my back !
Should I?
Must be one of those bleeding heart 'live and let live' idiots.
You want to break the news to him, or shall I?
Should we give him a standing ovation before his obliteration?
You take the left ankle I'm not all that hungry
When I started swimming for Uber I thought I would be my own boss.
This one is too skinny so we made a deal.  He gets ten minutes to find a fatter lunch morsel for me.
If he finds out,they'll close the beach for weeks!
He said he'd introduce me to his fat uncle.
Hey look, I'm a surfboard!
I know. I know. But I like getting my belly waxed.
If I knew that this is what a paralegal had to do I would have studied something else.
Green party warfare doctrine: Down with submarines.
I feel like we've come a long way since JAWS.
No, I am not going down alone
Oh spare me your attitude.  He's my chiropractor.
He wants a pedicure!
What? It’s a flavor saver.
I always pack a snack--low blood sugar, you know.
I’m trying to be the perfect host.
Yes, Stan, it is frustrating that I cannot touch the top of my head.
One stomp - human edibles. Two stomps - a boat.
These humans are taking their obsession with "Baby Shark" a bit too far.
These remoras are getting so annoying.
Way better than goat massage.
I swear people think they can walk all over me.
Its an ok decoy, but “Free Beer Guy” doesn’t work as well as “Big Breast Lady” .
They are taking this Baby Shark song a bit too far.
He's not the best, but most ashiatsu services don't do house calls.
Bro its Steven Spielberg. You can't eat him
I love feet.
These tourists walking all over us are starting to make me feel very salty.
I should have signed up as an Uber driver instead of letting this jerk ride me for free.
I would've started Uber sooner but they had a pretty thorough background check.
I get paid by the pound!
Next time, you get the take out!
I,ve got gas.
SUP"! "SUP!" Do you know anything about this 'SUP' frenzy
The dufus thought he was stepping into shallow water. In about five seconds I’m going flip up my head, open my mouth as wide as I can and swallow him whole.
Evolving Remoras...
If he hurts, I eat him.
We are sharks, but there is a person standing on me.
I thought he'd look good in the aquarium, turns blue and expands.

He should be lucky I’m not hungry
Now for his killer dismount.
No, if you bite him in half, I'll have to make two trips.
You want his left foot or right foot?
Do you want to get this guy off my back? You’re bid enough to swallow him whole so please don’t wait, his weight is killing me!

There has to be more to life than eating.
He is convinced Mr. Wonderful will be impressed on Shark Tank.

It's professional courtesy, he's a lawyer.
Oh, this? No, I'm just in it for the food.
I already ate the torso. Do you want a leg or not?
It sure would be easier if we met at the shallow end of the pool.
Luckily for him, I'm not feeling hungry; I'm too worried about picking up 'athlete's fin.'
He's my perfect disguise ... keeps all the tastier swimmers from panicking  when they see my dorsal fin.

Hanging ten is no longer an option I’m afraid.
I think this stand up paddleboard craze has gone too far, don't you agree?
No, honey, it's not an affair, just a great little massage.
I’d eat him, but the shiatsu’s too good.
I asked for Thai massage and this what I got.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
OK, It ain't the reef but here you get all the fish you can eat and water temperature control.
Well... haven’t you tried Noom?
It's better than traditional ashiatsu because it comes with a snack at the end.
It's Damien Hirst. Do you know anything about Formaldehyde?

Got a to-go lunch today.
Our image peaked with "Jaws." It has been all downhill since then.
This is not what I meant when I agreed to be the shark to back him.
Was it tasty?" 
"Not half.
Is there any leftovers left on me?
He says: "When the water recedes they will see I have trunks on, but before that I need to swim with the sharks." Also says I will get 10% commission, do you know what food that is?

Where does he think he is? Sea World?
Jake got the guy's upper half.
Get this guy off my back, he’s been on me all day!

"Don't play with your food, Kevin.
What a terrible weight on my back! Can you bite him please?
Leftovers.
Would you prefer the top half or the bottom half ?
Now I'm looking for something to top it off.
His idea is to jump from one of us to the other and back, for the idiots watching through the glass.  Let's drop him.

Is he worth attacking?

Roadpop...
It’s the ‘Treading Deep Water Massage’.  You have to try it, really limbers you up for attack.
I'm saving these bits till last.
Are you ready for lunch?  This guy doesn't understand that even at Sea World, we have our limits.
He's thinking either shoes or a suit.
I felt bad-I chomped his surfboard in half
humans always pretend they can swim

I would eat him, but he bribed me not to...
And we've still got a little old woman, a little old man, a barn full of threshers, a field full of mowers, a cow and a pig.
I've got to stop being an Uber driver in my spare time...
He thinks he is waist deep, wanna see total hysteria, then you can have him, I do owe you one.
....you laugh but its like Hello Fresh for busy on the go sea carnivores, they deliver it right to you.
Just between you and me, I think he needs a different boat.
With regular accupressure treatments, I'm able to thrash without back pain.
Something's been weighing on my mind recently ...
He thinks I’m rubber
baby shark, more like "annoyed shark doo, doo, do, do, do, doo"
Go away, you already had your half ...
The price of gas must have gone  up again....
My wife is making me try this vegetarian thing...

Sometimes dinner just really weighs me down.
I recommend the thighs.
Surfer beaches are more trouble than they're worth.

Dinner or foot massage?
This is the best bait I've ever used!
We met at a vegetarian support group. I am helping him show his friends that he can walk on water.
His other half is in my stomach.
It's a gig economy... things are changing fast. You better keep up.
No, let's pull his pants down... Then eat him.
With global warming and rising seas, I’ve decided to stay ahead of the curve... I call it SharkLyft!
And then they wonder why we attach.
Why do I always have to carry the heavy load?
Shall we flip for it?
Must be Uber Ocean summer surge.
Are you sure these are the toppings we ordered?

I believe in a balanced diet and he is surface to requirements.
I just can't bring myself to correct him.
Uber.
I still can't believe we let them bring the gig economy to the ocean...
When they said "Shark Tank" I never expected to be on TV.

They call it chicken.
I'd much rather be a 'fish out of water' at this point.
What I won't do to make it on Shark Week
Going vegan is really killing my mojo!
I was hungry. Now I'm just mad.
I can't stand humans but they can sure stand me.
Well, why on Earth would you suggest standing desks?
I already ate,but I couldn't stand watching him try to swim.
In about one minute, he won't have a leg to stand on.
Do I swallow him whole or only what I can see.
I'm prepping ingredients for tonight's human fin soup.  That's why.
No idea. He booked me with an app, apparently.
I am getting paid by Uber.
Whatever happened to just plain old paddle boarding?
They eliminated the whole 'jumping part' at orientation...
You were at my wedding, Denise...
It's your turn!
You should really try going vegan.
I hate humans
And I swear I can hear him humming "Mack the Knife."
Don't ask, it's a deal we made.
His trust  has changed me from a predator to
a support shark!
Feet are food, not friends!
It’s my dorsal feet
Just waiting for the other half to fall.

He promised to let me know if there are any jellyfish around
So I was just swimming around flossing my jaws with a trash sign that read “Rides for food” when his idiot just hopped on me. You wanna do lunch?
I wish I had a really good reason to ask him to move... like, 'You're blocking my blowhole.'
It’s foot-on-head disease, a precursor to foot-in-mouth disease.
He's much lighter since somebody ate his top.
Get lost, I'm chumming for a bigger fish than you!
OK..I’ ll toss him, you catch him and we’ll do lunch
He thinks he is surfing!
He is too skinny; I want to wait for a fatter prey.
No, I'm not ride-sharing with you.
You need to eat your whole meal before you swim away!
Working for Lyft has its drawbacks.
I am your better half!
Oh, the burden of humanity
I promised his mother I would chew off his ankles for the 1st half hour after he eats.
It's easier than goat yoga.
Apparently, they pay extra.
He's been standing on me all day...how long until I can eat him?
This is not my idea of surfing.
It helps with the cravings.
He has a new business model he wants to show us.
This ride share business is for the birds.
Bite his dick off!
I”am teaching him shark surfing
It's either acting as a surfboard or being hunted to extinction

I’m getting tired of this surfer dude, dude, dude, do, do, do, do.
His board? I dunno,"cept now I have to take him in
Want the other half?
You like it? Made 'er myself last weekend, the red-shorted bronzeskins usually bite hard this time of year.
I saved this one for a late night snack.
I told you I would bring dinner.
It's take away.
I can’t decide between the meal or the delivery guy.
It's the latest in lures.
Tourists- they'll stand on anything they can find.
I like your hat.
Well I'm no megalodon and I don't have shoulders, but I think he is seeing further, why?
A candidate for the Darwin Award? 

I shouldn’t have signed up for Uber!
Corporate Attorney!
He was an easy catch.  And at lunchtime, I'll do a backflip and eat.
I know.  After our next America,s got Talent 
Performance I'm gonna eat him.
i`m his handler for the terra firma world exhibit
You should try it. It does wonders for back pain with the added bonus of a tasty snack.
He said he was an ashiatsu massage therapist, but I think he just wanted to show off for his girlfriend.
I really cant believe I've been mistaken for Shamu

Repton, Alabama
I'm gonna dump this guy if he doesn't cut his toenails.
No more pink mustaches, but I'm still an independent contractor.
Who let him into the shark tank.
One, Two, Three.......
You see son, this is what happens when "Shark Attacks" go down.
I'm afraid I'm gonna put my foot in my mouth.
Ever feel topped off with riffraff?
Once I get the vest, we can fly, he says.
We're trying to economize, so I've decided to bring lunch from home
This is no seal, Bill.
It's the new under-water shiatsu. They won't bite.
Just earning some extra chum through Uber
He complained that Uber costs an arm and a leg, so I'm only charging him a leg.
The wife said she wanted to fix the den, so I said I’d Uber to raise some cash.

Air, land and sea....Uber alles.
He's on the lookout for Jaws 4.
He said he'll take me out for shrimp later if I help him just this once.
This standoff is aboveboard.  It's clearly not bait-and-switch.
What are you lookin’ at, you never heard of Uber?
It's called a "lure" and yes, it was "as seen on TV".
He’s a ten-tied genius, man. Like gentle, but like totally deep tissue, my broheim.
Its's only fair. You got the first half.
Yeah, I finally became a ScUber driver.
When did you switch from Uber to Lyft?

Sigute Miller, Valley Village, CA
He says that he is just along for the ride.
He’s with the crew of ‘Shark Week’
We can't. He's a corporate lawyer and he's family.
I'll flip him, you catch.
I must be stressed. I'm feeling more weight on my shoulders than ever before.
I blame this kind of boldness on Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper
No, your first bite should be his knees.
I swear one more time he sings baby shark du doo du I will eat him up.
You've lost your mascot!
It's this gig economy.
Pull the shorts down, it said, pant-ing.
Rock-paper-scissors?
I gave him my word that he will be able to keep his head above water level...
Actually, my appetite has been a bit off lately...
This Ride-a-Shark business is really cramping my style!
Getting their feet wet with their showboating ecotourism is killing my back—not to mention the environment.
I know, I know, but I’m trying to improve my image with those guys!
He's mine - from here it's just a flip and a gulp.
I’ve always wanted to “hang ten,” but I’ve never been able to resist eating them.

Now I know how it feels to be taken for a ride.
Don't yuck my yum.

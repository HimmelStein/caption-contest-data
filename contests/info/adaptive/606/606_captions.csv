As senior squeegee-man during flight simulations, moving up didn’t pan out.
Yep, we're lost. We passed this guy an hour ago.
He's always had his head in the clouds, but THIS ???
OK, but he is going to have to check that bag.
It's the only way Delta lets you redeem their vouchers
While stoned, he mistook a weather balloon for exhaust from a semi.
Jack had it all till the beanstalk died.
Well, let me at least wipe your windshield.
Same guy, same cloud. I think we're going in circles.
For those seated on the right side of the plane, the Grand Canyon should be visible in a moment. And for those seated on the left, an excellent view of Bob.
Don't make eye contact.
Keep going. He just wants to clean our windshield then charge us a fiver.
Why do they always pick a spot where it's impossible to pull over...
I really don't understand cloud commuting.
Either he is high or I am.
Damn, Sully, it’s always an adventure with you.
Remember when basic economy level still got you a seat on the plane?
Act like theres no room.
Some people will do anything to avoid TSA screening.
I’ll bet you he changes finger when he finds out this is Air Force One.
Looks like United has kicked out another unruly passenger.
He used to squeegee the windows.
I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t obey the laws of physics.
That backpack would never fit in the overhead.
Hank, check our coordinates . . . I think we passed that guy 20 minutes ago.
Maybe we shouldn't have eaten those mushrooms before take-off.
At least one every time we fly over Colorado...
I thought you said your son was grounded.
Relax. I said, hitchhiker. Not hijacker.
Uber surge pricing again
Careful, it took forever to get the last one out of the turbine.
How high ARE we?
Throttle down Jenson, so he thinks we're stopping.
Wow, everything is in the cloud now.
Standby passengers may now board.
Who saved him in the cloud?
Do you think he knows we’re headed to Cleveland?
Maybe heaven isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Okay, but he's gonna have to check that bag.
Amazing what some guys will do to bypass TSA checkpoints.
Don't stop. There'll be a Tesla along any minute to pick him up.
Don't slow down!
Is he cirrus?
I can’t find anything in the FFA regulations about picking up a hitchhiker.
...and if you look to our left you will see a united airlines passenger
Fine, but god help us if he needs a kosher meal.
He knows we're non-stop, right?
That guy is way too high to pick up.
You'd think they'd know by now that we always overbook.
He must have refused to give up his seat on a United flight
He's never going to make his connection.
It's amazing what you can find in the Cloud.
I would but he might be carrying liquids.
I see him too... guess we're both a little higher than usual.
He must be one of our Economy Minus passengers.
Do you suppose that he would do the windshield for us?
Don't pick him up, he's obviously high.
I hadn't realized that we crossed into Colorado already
They keep making the frequent flyer program harder and harder to use.
Poor guy. United must have left him here.
He's probably booked an Air B&B.
Poor guy ... he was there yesterday too.
Last week he washed the windshield and asked for twenty bucks.
Flying standby sure is rough these days.
I'll pick him up, but he's going to need to check that bag.
It's moments like these when I ask myself: "What would Sully do?"
Everything is cloud based these days.
What a long strange trip it's been.
I don't think he understands the gravity of his situation.
Don't stop. He has a carry-on.
I hate flying over Woodstock.
Before all the extra security concerns, I used to pick them up all the time.
Flying standby seems to be getting more and more complicated.
He always flies south this time of year - it’s Jazzfest.
Flying stand-by gets weirder and weirder.
Lets just pretend we don't see him..
Some people will do anything to avoid going through security.
Some folks will do anything to avoid those security lines.
For God’s sake, don’t make eye contact.
Too bad we're going the other way.
Hitchhikers I can take. What I really hate are the sqweegie men.
Tower: We have another one coming down from Cloud Nine.
I thought Jesus had a beard.
That's one way to avoid the TSA.
Doesn't he know that we're not going to San Francisco?
Isn't that the guy we just bought drugs from?
The rideshare economy has gone too far.
There goes another passanger kicked off of Spirit Airlines.
That's the same guy I saw at 87th and 3rd avenue.
He's pretty high.
He's still here?
Jim, ignore him. He still doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation.
Boy, you can store anything in the Cloud these days.
Ladies and gentlemen, off of our left wing you'll see an example of the increasingly rare hobo-cumulus formation.
Forgot his password so now he's stuck in the cloud forever.
We really need to do a better job with the final boarding call.
See? Everyone is moving to the cloud!
Fine, but the rule is vouchers, miles, or points. Nobody flies for free.
I guess they must be dragging people off the plane mid-flight now.
Don’t pick him up. He could be an aerial killer.
He’s high.
"This guy again?'
We must be over Colorado.
See, this is why I think I need a vacation.
I always wondered what it meant to be uploaded to the cloud.
Happens every time we over-fly Colorado.
I am not picking him up-his bag is too big for the overhead compartment.
Yep, we’re over Colorado.
Man, they're moving everything to the cloud these days!
No, if Mom finds out we picked up a hitchhiker, she’ll never let us fly her plane again.
They always just want to use the restroom.
I didn't realize people could get that high.
..looks like like they laid off another iCloud support guy
Passengers on your left, wave as we pass by; you can witness another Baby Boomer's failed attempt to "upload to the cloud."
"Doesn't he know O'Hare is Purgatory?
He must have missed the cumulonimbus.
That's the new very basic economy section.
It's getting tougher to fly standby
That must have been his girlfriend five clouds back.
Cloud commuting. It's the next big thing.
Don't make eye contact.
Everyone’s using the cloud these day.
We're right above Denver, aren't we?
There's another flight behind us that can pick him up, right?
He's Microsoft's problem, not ours.
I don't know. He looks high.
That bag looks too big for carry-on.
Don't slow down or make eye contact.
People will do just about anything these days to avoid TSA lines, won't they?
You're not really thinking about picking him up, are you?
Picked him up once and all he wanted was to use the toilet.
We've just entered Colorado air space".
He’s been on that same damn cloud for the past 15 years!
Must have gotten bumped at the last minute.
Looks like United is removing passengers mid-flight now.
Someone forgot to put their phone on "airplane mode"...
No way he’s fitting that into the overhead compartment.
That’s a negative tower, hitchhiker, not hijacker.
I don't need instrumentation to know we're over Colorado.
Don't pick him up. He looks high.
We must be over Denver.
Tell air traffic control, we have another one on Cloud Niner.
Don't stop. He's probably carrying liquids.
Can’t, we’re nonstop.
Don’t make eye contact, we are already late
It's the new cloud-based ticketing platform.
I think we just got a like, Bob
Doesn't he know this is a nonstop flight?
Elon Musk: Can you guys give me a lift?
Someone should tell him the sky's the limit.
Elon Musk has really let himself go.
You're right. There's nothing in the manual about hitchhikers.
Sorry, I don't trust cloud-based applications.
Either he's in trouble or we are.
Wow, talk about stand by.
Don’t stop — what if he’s some kind of weirdo?
He prefers this over our boarding procedure.
I'm not saying you should lie to the FAA. I'm just saying, what happens in the air stays in the air.
They'll do anything to not check a bag.
You know, you're right. You rarely see a hitchhiker at this altitude.
Looks like his Stairway to Heaven didn’t reach the top floor!
Is that a cloud or is our altimeter wrong and we're in deep trouble?
He could help us with the tolls.
Not after what happened last time, Greg.
Should we tell him his trip was one-way?
Our left wing is about to eliminate that problem.
You see more and more of that these days when you fly over Colorado.
Out the left side you can see Mt. Hood and DB Cooper.
No,I'm not calling that in.
Please tell me we haven't taken off, yet!
Wait, stop! I know that guy!
Looks like we just entered Colorado air space
Keep going, I know this guy- he never chips in for gas.
Don't stop; no more deals for NRA members.
looks like just another drifter to me .
Careful, I hear he could become FAA chief.
You're right, Sully. It would make for a great sequel.
What was in those brownies?
Ha! Complained about the service on an earlier flight.
We can take him as far as Denver.
Well, that just goes to show how innefective the wall is.
Fifty points if you catch him with the wing.
Happens every time we fly out of Denver
This 'moving to the Cloud' trend is getting out of hand.
If he's hitching from a mountain peak we're in trouble.
He must be one of those people who work in the cloud.
Guess we are now over Colorado.
What if he’s carrying a water bottle?
Would it kill you to stop and pick him up?
Well, he definitely made it over the Wall.
There he is again! I’m telling you, that’s the guy who played Fredo in ‘The Godfather.’
Guy's kidding himself if he thinks any plane these days isn't oversold.
Oh, great—now I’ll have ‘Eight Miles High’ stuck in my head again.
Sorry, we are going down, not up.
I think his guide to the galaxy is a little out of date.
He’s been there since the finale of ‘Lost.’
Looks like someone didn't pay the extra $5 for an allocated seat.
Man, he looks high as a kite!
Don’t stop. He’s a drifter.
Yeah, I guess heaven's not for everyone.
I picked a bad week to stop sniffing glue.
He's on standby.
It’s still better than flying standby!
United used to pull passengers off before takeoff; it's obviously gotten worse.
Never pick up a hitchhiker son. Don't let their mysterious charm cloud your judgement.
Sorry, dude, the skies aren't that friendly.
SpaceX is testing cheaper ways of bringing astronauts home.
Flying stand-by gets more complicated every year.
Do you think he understands if we stop to pick him up, we will all die?
I don't care if he is on Cloud 9, we are not stopping
He's definitely on his own plane.
I think we are too high
Let's stop if he's still here on the way back.
He's high - so whatever you do, don't make eye contact.
I think he's already flying high.
I don't know, he looks pretty high.
We better pass, his carry-on bag is too big.
Tower, I'd like to report a UFO...an unidentified freeloader.
If it's not Elvis or Jerry Garcia I ignore them.
So much for the D.B. Cooper mystery.
I didn't realize we were that high.
Remember back in the day when you wouldn't think twice about giving him a lift?
Well, there's definitely not a prison anywhere nearby
I don’t trust anyone with his feed in the clouds.
Everything is in the cloud these days.
Looks like Delta overbooked again.
Wasn't that the guy on the no-fly list?
I guess Jim Morrison couldn’t break on through to the other side.
No, that bag will never fit in the overhead bin.
Sorry sir, even the overhead compartment isn’t free these days.
Some passengers will do anything to avoid those TSA checks.
This simulator's a bit over the top, isn't it?
The guys running the simulator are easily bored.
"Build a wall," they said...
Don't pick him up. He looks high as a kite.
Last week he just gave me the finger.
Don’t make eye contact, it only encourages them.
Sorry pal, we’re just going a couple more blocks.
The boss said never let anyone on board without a ticket.
Come on, Steve. It looks like he's been through Hell.
It looks like Forrest is finally tired of running.
He thinks we're the Jefferson Airplane.
Are you Godot?
We told him to stand on the LEFT side.
I'd stop, but there's too much traffic behind me.
Folks, this is your co-pilot speaking. To our left is that guy your parents always warned you about.
It’s not how I imagined purgatory.
Another cloud commuter hoping to ride share.
Not again, Elon!
Looks like he ran out of sky miles.
I bet he was an editor in his previous life.
Too bad we are a non stop flight!
This always happens when we fly out of Denver.
Now boarding lowest priority passengers.
Do we still get surge pricing if he doesn't use the app?
I may be hallucinating, but didn’t we just see that same guy back a few hundred miles ago.
I don't know...that bag looks over the size and weight limit to me.
And we were worried about geese?
Do we have room for a dreamer?
"Dirty cloud hippie. Don't even think about stopping, Dan".
So this is boarding group Z, eh?
You had the beef, right?
Looks like United overbooked again.
If this weren't the flight simulator I'd pick him up.
Did your simulator training cover this?
I'm afraid the flight is overbooked.
Are we still doing pickups on cloud nine?
Go past him quietly and he might not notice us.
Should we pull over?
He should have taken the nonstop.
I guess I really don't know clouds at all.
I guess Air Miles only get you so far.
Yeah, they warned me about flying over Colorado.
Ignore him. He’s high.
he might have more luck with an Uber Pool.
I'm getting really tired of giving these Google cloud engineers a ride home.
Let's keep going. There will be plenty of other planes coming this way.
Well, he's making progress. Last time we saw him he was at 25,000 feet.
Gives a whole new meaning to high-jacker.
There were some obvious drawbacks to the Haight-Ashbury Space Program.
That's my first time seeing the cumulo-nimrod cloud formation.
Ever since the election nothing surprises me much anymore.
He's still going to have to pay the full fare.
I don't know, Ned... I don't think that bag will fit in the overhead compartments.
I'd pick him up, but I just don't like his altitude.
This wasn't part of the flight simulator.
Don't pick him up. The last one got stuck in the engine.
Better report a Cloud 9er.
Only if pitches in for gas.
Damn... am I high, or is he?
Has the airline added a fee for that yet?
Now it looks like United should rethink the way it handles passengers with too much carry-on.
Right after recreational marijuana was legalized, the software updates for this flight simulator got weirder and weirder .
Is that a Trump sign?
He’s taking “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” both too literally and yet not quite far enough.
I'd stop if he had a dog.
Whoa....are you seeing this?! A green shirt with those pants?
the weather man did say " high, today, in the sixties, right ?"
This guy looks high, don't stop.
Your only concern is whats in the bag?
Looks like cloud 9 isn’t working for him Sir.
He must be confusing us with Spirit airline.
Don't look him in the eye or you'll feel guilty.
Is this Part 2 of Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy?
The last time we picked him up, he hit on me.
Are we lost? That's the third time we've seen him.
Trump's wall just got 30,000 feet higher.
He's plane crazy.
Wow, cloud storage continues to be a transformational technology.
Don't stop. He's high on something.
Don't look at him. You'll only encourage him
These low fare ticket holders...they’ll do anything to try to get a seat.
God was his co-pilot.
We are already overbooked.
Keep going, I'm sure he's high.
Hot dang! That's DB Cooper!
normally I would , but we're non stop
Keep going. He might be carrying liquids.
Another Trump voter rejected by St. Peter.
Jesus.
Slow down...slow...let him almost touch the door then jerk forward.
Man, is he high or what?
Beats flying Basic Economy.
He has TSA Precheck.
I guess ‘Cloud 9’s not all you’d expect!
Oh yeah, we’re over Colorado.
Oh, my. He uploaded himself into the Cloud and now he wants a ride back to Earth.
He just doesn’t appreciate the gravity of the situation.
I think we’re high
Is there anything you can't do in the cloud these days?
Yet another kid falls for that backup to the cloud scam!
I see the new edition to hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has been released.
Captain, flying over Colorado is certainly interesting!
Even ride-sharing is up on the cloud these days.
Keep driving; he looks high as a kite.
Don't even think about it. He lost his security clearance.
But, I can't tell if he from one of those shit hole countries or not.
Thinks he's on cloud nine.
Didn't we see him on our outbound flight?
You know what? We should really look into becoming Uber pilots.
Looks like he’s high on something.
Oh great! ...you made eye contact.
Cloud 9 ain’t what it used to be.
Definitely too big for a personal item.
Cloud commuting!
Move over George. I bet he's got pot.
Look, he thinks we're doing a good job.
Avoid eye contact and lock the doors.
I'll never get that song outta my head for the rest of the day!
This will be a better movie than "Sully"!
How do we actually do 'friendly skies' these days?
Dropped him over Coachella last month.
I guess I'll never understand the cloud.
I'm going to let you call this one in.
I, captain, am tripping balls. Sucka fucka ducka, gucka. 3 rabble-rousers wiping me clean. You want that on draft, doctor? Do you-doctor? Doctor, I'm asking you a sassy question. Cracksag ballbag browntot.
Don't pull over, he looks high.
Can you give me a ride down?
That new guidance system is archaic but effective.
I really wish they'd gotten around to servicing the altimeter.
Don't even think about it, Sully.
I wouldn't. He's high.
Gas, grass or ass. No one rides for free!
Actually, he's on Cloud 7.
It's too bad we're not going his way.
Let's pull over then zoom ahead before he gets on.
Don't stop. He's high on something.
How the fuck is he doing that?
Just pretend you didn’t see him!
I don't know, Hank . . .he looks a little sketchy to me.
He MUST be high if he thinks we are going drop him off at heaven.
I didn't see anything, did you?
Too bad that TSA hasn't screened him.
We'll pick him up on the return trip.
Hey, Bob, I think another state just legalized weed.
I hate the Cloud Nine route!
They don't often hitch from heaven to Newark.
Need a lift?
I'd like to help too, but that carry-on looks too big for the overhead
Relax, Jenkins. It's just another LSD tripper on Cloud 9 who's ready to come down.
People will do anything to avoid the lines at security.
Another damn hippie with his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy head trip....!
Standby?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land.
The same guy.
Are we really the Friendly Skies if we don't pick him up?
He's higher than a kite.
Millennials feel like everything should be free
He probably hasn’t heard we no longer give NRA discounts.
Wow, strange what you can save on your cloud.
That's the problem with these 'cloud-based' businesses.
What if he's not TSA pre-approved?
Gotta be high.
See if you can drag him with the wing
Should we ask which way he's headed?
The new TSA fast track
I hope he knows that carry-on will cost him $50
He looks high to me, Captain.
At least this guy isn't trying to clean our windsheild
He'd have better luck if he weren't insistent on going to LaGuardia.
pull over, 7A isn't occupied.
It’s the new standby class: catch a cloud, hope for the best.
He is one of those guys always on Cloud Nine !
"Just backpacking across flyover country".
Ordinarily I’d be inclined to stop but strictly speaking he’s not down on his luck.
Heaven can wait
Some people will do anything to avoid the TSA line.
Just keep going. He looks like he's high.
His miles expired mid-trip
I'd help him out, but I forgot my password to the Cloud.
Don't slow down. He will just wipe the windshield with a dirty rag
He looks a little sketchy. Let's not stop.
He’s free falling again.
Okay, I'll pick him up--but he can't have anything over four ounces in his backpack.
Baby boomer in the sky trying to hide his carbon footprint.
Don't stop. he may be dangerous
Absolutely not. Last time we picked him up he never stopped whining about how much fresher the air is outside.
Another Boomer, always high on something.
He must be on stand-by.
Don't look at him. He will make you feel guilty
Apparently He Hasn't Earned His Wings Yet.
I’ll notify air traffic control that we just entered Colorado airspace.
If you can't fly me to the moon, can you at least help me dream among the stars?
I don't think we should pick him up. He could be a highjacker.
Should we stop for him?
No way. He looks like a smoker.
Until recently I thought only data could get lost in the cloud.
Well alright, but he'll have to check his bag.
Watch how fast he goes from thumb to finger.
My god! It's D.B. Cooper!
Pretty tough to get your stuff out of the cloud once you've stored it there.
Better pick that guy up. He's in Boarding Group 8.
Please tell me that's cloud and not snow drift.
But, I can't tell if he from one of those shit hole countries or not.
Houston? We have a problem.
Don’t make eye contact, Dave.
Keep going. That bag will never fit in the overhead.
He looks like he could use a lift.
He kinda looks like D.B. Cooper. Keep flying
OK, Sully. I dare you to land it on that cloud.
I guess the sky really is the limit.
I've heard of getting high, but he must have some really good weed!
I'd say pull over but that bag will definitely not fit into the overhead compartment.
No way that bag is carry-on compliant.
I hear he’s doing research for a revised edition of “The Hicthhiker’s Guide to the Troposhphere”.
Do you think the mushroom risotto tasted a little odd?
I don't know. I just don't like his atmosphere.
Sorry he hasn't passed TSA check, reminds me of Twilight Zone episode
He expects a free ride AND a free carry-on?
I suppose heaven is nice, but you have to arrange your own transportation from purgatory.
This sure is a long way up to use Uber.
Don't stop. That dude's clearly high on something.
What happens in the cloud, stays in the cloud.
What did people do before their lives were in the cloud?
I hope he catches a ride before it rains.
Isn't there a cloud based ride share system?
He must be on stand-by.
Easy to see we just crossed over the Colorado border...
Don't pick him up - He is high!
I'll bet he's got weed.
You know, maybe we did crash.
Another angel in a mid-life crisis.
He's beta testing the Air Lyft app.
Let’s not. He looks a little scruffy.
Well, everything else is in the cloud. It was just a matter of time.
I don't care if he does know the meaning of the universe, no hitchhikers!
He's high if he thinks we're picking him up.
He must have been bumped from an earlier flight
Sully, here we go again.
I can't get that song "Eight Miles High" out of my head.
Passing over Colorado?
I was hoping this flight would go without a hitch.
By any chance, are you guys going to San Fran, man?
The “Petit Prince”, he ain’t.
He’s high on something.
Cloud nine ain't what it used to be!
Man, Cloud Nine's looking a little run-down these days ...
Oh ... him again.
Must be a Grateful Dead Fan
I guess they finally built that wall around heaven.
Those snowboard guys are amazing !
Apparently cloud 9 wasn't all it was cracked up to be...
Whatever we do here, we CANNOT bump an asian doctor from his seat.
Hellbound?
Either he's high on drugs or we are.
Every time a bell rings, an angel skips the proper boarding zones procedure.
It's cloud's illusions I recall I really don't know clouds at all
I hate flying over states that have legalized marihuana.
I wonder how he got through security.
I heard United tossed him out here.
I don't care if it is Jerry Garcia. We're not stopping.
Don't stop. I'm not in the mood for another 'my parachute didn't open' story.
Too bad we're not going that way."
So my first thought is, 'now I'm skeptical of rain.'
We can charge him the last minute economy fare.
I guess he’s still on stand by.
Captain, have you ever read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'?
I hate flying over California.
You dudes heading to Tom Petty’s party?
He's lost some hair and gotten older, but I'm telling you it has to be D.B. Cooper.
Sorry, but this is a nut-free flight.
The cloud cover is low real today .
They really moved everything to the Cloud
That's why they call it "post-modern art", Dad.
Looks like Jesus has hit a rough spot in heaven
Trump's going to have to build that wall a bit higher.
Hitchhighkers...
Wow. I thought we removed overbooked passengers before we left the gate.
Let's pick him up. He's got the guide to the galaxy.
You see more of these guys since they legalized marijuana
But do you think it's safe to pull over here?
Cloud computing, now cloud commuting—I can't keep up.
Yeah, cloud consulting dried up last year.
'I guess that's what they mean by "travelling light".'
I guess the drugs have kicked in.
OK yeah...that Uber prayer didn't seem to work out.
One of us is higher than usual.
must've really pissed off that uber driver
Another United passenger, Captain.
We're not falling for that again...
He just got bumped off United.
Isn't there an FAA rule against picking up hitch hikers?
I guess, we are not allowed to take immigrants
He's on standby.
He's the guy that started the whole cloud thing back in the day.
Hitch High King
OK; just be sure he knows the baggage fee is ass, gas, or grass.
You have to give him credit for just getting this far.
He usually hangs out under the jet bridge.
That's Spirit Airlines new economy class
Do you think he's the hitch hiker to the galaxy guy?
You never know when you’re entertaining an angel.
Better not. He looks pretty high.
What I'll never understand is this trend for torn jeans.
I only stop for Victoria's Secret Angels.
That's Elon. SpaceX must be out of service.
If we pick him up, he still has to pay the $25 baggage fee.
Says he wants to go to Cloud 9
He probably wants a ride to cloud 9.
I never pick up hitchhikers any more. Too dangerous.
Hey there's a guy standing on a cloud over there! That's pretty neat!
Poor schmuck. I dropped him off there last week.
Well, now we know what became of D.B. Cooper.
He must be a good person if he's up here.
Don't pick him up! He's high!
Some guys will do anything to avoid the TSA.
BUT WE'D HAVE TO CHARGE HIM FOR THE BAG.
I don't know, he looks high to me.
Sure. It's $25 for the bag.
"Looks like another escapee from Purgatory".
He must've gotten kicked off the other airliner.
Uber doesn't offer service in this neighborhood.
Well, we do have an open seat in economy.
Don't slow down...we need the lift more than he does
He flew with United.
Sure, but there'll be a fee to check the bag.
Take the next one.We're late.
You remember what happened last time we stopped, don't you?
He's been up here since the Summer of Love - just wants a lift to Frisco.
I was always in favor of legal marijuana, but lately I'm not so sure.
Don't stop. He's obviously high on something.
Hey! You! Get off of that cloud.
I am going to have seriously re-think storing my personal data in the cloud.
Well, he obviously doesn't understand the situation of the gravity up here...
Just pretend you don’t see him....non revenue.
I’d normally stop, but that carry-on bag exceeds regulations.
Aah Chuck, this is the 4th one since we crossed into Colorado.
This is your captain. If you'll look out the left side of the plane, you'll see that you've entered the Vermouth Triangle.
Either he's wearing some kind of anti-gravity boots, or we're dead.
It's the last boarding category.
I'm sure someone will be by for him very soon.
I don't know if he's on the stuff or I am.
How could we possibly board somebody who hasn't gone through security?
The weather report was right - cloudy with hitchhikers.
"Now there is a lost soul".
I would, but his carry-on won't fit in the overhead bin.
Does he want a ride or really likes our plane?
Now we know what became of D. B. Cooper!
This is some good weed.
Do you think he'll chip in for gas?
Looks like he's high to me.
These designer cannabis strains are really getting out of hand; I mean, there IS such a thing as, "too high!"
He got so high in 1968 that he still hasn't come down.
Some people will do anything to avoid the baggage fee.
Sorry our backseat is much smaller than it appears
Oh good! My lyft is here.
Things are so bad, people are even leaving Cloud Nine.
Full seat, next flight sir.
No, don't pick him up. He looks really high,
Man, everything is Cloud-based these days.
He’ll have to check that.
We’ll pick you up on the return flight.
Isn’t that your kid?
Passing over Colorado?
Pick him up. I don't think he is wearing shoes.
Sorry, buddy. This is a nonstop.
Wow, this is the 3rd one this week, . Heaven must be full that they getting rid of the reject.
Anything to avoid checking in a bag at the terminal...
He was on Cloud 9 last week.
I've seen him before and he's always high.
What some people will do to avoid a security check.
I thought that guy was on the "no fly" list...
Remember nonstop flights?
I thought he was on the no fly list
about how old would D.B. Cooper be?
Can you believe how high that guy is?
Sully, once was enough.
Just ignore him. He's tried this trick before.
Not without pre-check.
Don't stop. I think he's high on something.
So Up with People is still a thing?
I guess corporate was serious about the new cloud-based standby system.
That's what happens when you launch on a Ford, instead of a Tesla.
I repeat, Uber drone passenger still awaiting pickup. Over and out.
No, if we do, we'll just destroy his will to fly on his own.
Flight 776 to Air Force One... Are you missing a staffer?
These west coast flights certainly are more interesting since legalization.
Is that a hitchhiker or our first positive review?
Did I tell you my drug test is next week?
Have a heart. He probably just missed the last shuttle.
He needs a shower.
I really wish people wouldn't take 'A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' to heart.
Looks like Larry's trippin' on Cloud 9 again.
I was certain we got rid of him.
What does he think, we can just open the door to let him in?
The "Twilight Zone Airplane Troll" sure isn't what he used to be.
Just ignore him - he's trying to hitch a ride to the Galaxy
A lot of the hitchhickers around Denver are this high.
Wonder how long he's been on Cloud 9.
You'd think a cloud computing tech would be paid more than that.
The plane in front of us must be an American Airlines.
Looks like United overbooked again.
Nobody's picked him up since we dropped him off here last week.
Don't pick him up. He looks high.
Sir, how come you have never given me a compliment on my flying?
Looks like another cloud nine return trip.
I dunno, he must be on standby.
Before deregulation, we could have picked him up.
Let's check our coordinates . . . I think one of us is lost.
I picked a bad day to fly sober.
Going to LA?
Better not. He looks high.
We can't , there's no place to pull over.
I heard you dragged someone off earlier. Can I take his seat?
It's our newest economy class.
I told you not to get so high.
What say we don't include this in the flight-log?
Better check those vegan brownies.
These regional carriers treat their pilots like dirt!
Forecast says a beautiful day. Not a cloud in the sky. And you’re just gonna leave him there?
Well, he would have to remove his belt and light coat first.
You'd think United would have landed before removing him...
Good thing he only has a carry-on.
Don't stop. He's obviously high.
This is weird but have you heard about the hitchhikers the folks at NASA pick up?
Elderly hippie standing in whipped cream on runway, 10-4.
Well, that's one way to avoid a TSA pat down.
Sorry, we're fully booked.
Don't pick up hitchhikers, Captain. Especially when they're high.
Only if he has gas money.
Yeah, he's in the cloud and wants to get back to Silicon Valley but no one will stop for him.
It looks like Cloud Nine has fallen on hard times.
Maybe he has gas money.
Ignore him. He’s high.
We must be over Colorado.
Sorry, we only go as far as cloud eight.
Elvis hitchhiking. They call it a "contact mirage". We must be flying over Colorado!
Everybody's using the cloud these days.
I get so tired of these guys trying to hook a cloud ride.
Don't worry, he'll wing it.
Quick! Pretend we don't see him.
I think he's telling us to bring the nose up.
Wow! He must be really high!
I know we can't stop, but I still feel a little guilty.
Do you mind checking the altimeter one more time?
The air traffic controllers in Key West are sure a different breed.
For the last time, we can't pull over!
You can't trust these types- they're always a little high.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
Wow, cloud computing really overpromised.
I see our airline got a new angel investor
Ass, gas, or grass?
Thrust me when I say he doesn't need a lift.
Uber really is going too far.
I do hope someone picks him up before it rains.
Say Alf... do you think drugs are getting stronger?
Forget it. The last one we rescued complained about the airline food.
probably a terrorist
Our oxygen levels are improving, Johnson. My hallucinations are up to the 1970s.
I thought United changed their passenger removal policy.
I hope he knows to duck for the wing!
I'm sure it's just a weathered buffoon.
What would Jesus do?
Douglas Adams again...what part of 'we can't fly that far' does he not understand?
He must think we're taxiing.
Always the most awkward part of this route.
Whoa! I would really like to try whatever he is on!
We've seen a lot of this since they legalized pot in California.
You think that's a wig?
See this guy's got the right altitude!
You would think he'd be fine hanging out on cloud 9.
Yeah, he's a beta tester who went cloud
The way people dress these days! No wonder he was bumped from PearlyGatesExpress!
We can only pick him up if he's been TSA prechecked.
Hey, this ain't the "Airway to Heaven," Dude!
He's probably been waiting an eternity for someone to pick him up.
Hey Frank....how's that for a cloud-based platform?
Sorry! We're going down, you'll have to catch the next flight to go up.
We can only stop on cloud nine.
That must be the new super economy class.
Hey Mitch, there's another one of those Cloud Entry TSA Pre-Check.
Wow. He used to fly Pence around. I thought he got a job in White House.
Ignore him, I can tell he's high.
These people avoiding the baggage fees are getting ridiculous!
Don't stop. He looks suspicious.
He must be high.
I guess life on Cloud 9 is not so great after all.
We’re not going where he’s going
Captain, wasn't this the guy on the mountaintop café in a previous cartonn?
Some folks will do anything to avoid the baggage check fee.
Is that Neil Young?
Looks like millennials have taken Jack Kerouac to the cloud.
Layovers are not what they used to be.
Looks like we found D.B. Cooper.
Looks like Jack Kerouac needs a lift again.
Gas, Grass, or Ass, buddy. Nobody rides for free!
Burning Man is so tight.
I picked the wrong week to stop drinking.
Okay, give him a ride, but my Mother can never know about this.
Guess he ain't on cloud 9.
Caption, do you think he might know where we are?
I'd stop, but that bag will never fit under the seat in front of him
Don't stop. That thumb isn't in a full upright and locked position.
If it’s D. B. Cooper, tell him the fare has risen.
Look, another United passenger.
And folks, off to your left, you'll see the inspiration for a classic 1960's Rolling Stones hit.
We've got a schedule to keep. He can catch the next one.
He probably wants a ride to the SkyMall.
Someone should tell this guy, 'Only prayers get you out of Purgatory". He'll be out there all day
They stopped giving angels wings after the 2008 housing crisis.
Whatever you do, don't make eye contact.
I hate to stereotype people, but I wouldn’t pick that guy up on the jersey turnpike.
The lunacy of that guy is beyond terminal.
Just pull over, Phil. We never make our arrival times anyways.
Can you check our altitude again, Steve?
O.K., one of us is really high!
Yeah, I see him. Happens every time we’re over Woodstock
Makes you wonder if some of the discount fares are worth it?
Keep going. Probably high.
Woah - that guy took getting high to a whole new level.
We can’t, syncing with the cloud is always such a hassle.
I liked flying better when nothing was stored in the cloud.
Ok. As long as he chips on for gas.
Same guy, same place, every Friday!
I'm thinking Rod Serling, Shatner and weed collaborated to change that 'Zone' episode.
Same Guy. Same Cloud. Every Week!
What a long strange trip it's been.
That's a funny looking bird.
He's too cheap to call an Uber.
"We must be flying over Aspen".
Hippy on Cloud 9
Watch out, sometimes they get stuck in the engine.
I wonder what's in the backpack.
We won't if you're worried, but I still don't think he's a killer.
Think the hippie has a frequent traveler number?
People certainly get desperate when they miss their connecting flight.
I always thought it was "Stairway to Heaven" and "Highway to Hell."
DO YOU know the way to San Jose?
Cirrusly?
Guess some who wander are lost.
So that's how my files are transferred through the cloud.
I've told him before - we don't stop for hitchhikers.
I guess his flight was overbooked.
Sorry bud, its clear skies over that way
And that's our Cloud Engineer !
We should give him a lift. I think he's small enough to fit into one of our passenger seats.
Darn. I was hoping this flight would go off without a hitch
That's the ninth one and the first to look happy
Sure, you can have a lift but it'll be 40 bucks for the bag.
It's Douglas Adams again. Just ignore him.
The wall simply wasn't high enough.
Tough luck, buddy. We’re going the other way.
I'd stop, but we're on final approach.
Keep going, that bag won't fit in the overhead.
Hold up, let me grab my Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
Apparently, people will do anything to avoid TSA...
Call me soft, but I just think United has taken this involuntary de-boarding thing too far.
Does he know how hard it is to slow down up here?
I wouldn't stop for that guy, he looks really high.
He asked one too many questions on Air Force One.
These hippies are higher every year.
Sorry, but that bag will not fit in the overhead bin, or under the seat in front of you>
I pulled over once. Never again.
That's boarding group 58
When you see God for the first time.
Last time I picked one up he wouldn't stop complaining about the cabin pressure
Bob, you know the rules, no hitchhikers.
Just pull over!
It's that new type of standby they've started offering.
Wish I hadn't seen that Twilight Zone
We must be close to Bermuda.
This guy keeps forgetting his guide to the Galaxy.
So much for Trump's wall.
This ICloud thing is getting out of hand.
"Could you take me to cloud nine"?
United has really got to cool it with these passenger kick-offs.
Holographs sure travel a long ways.
Don’t stop. You never know.
Hey, isn't that Timothy Leary?
That guy must really be high.
I guess he took the stairway up.
I think we have one basic economy seat left.
Isn't that the chap that was thrown off the earlier flight to San Francisco?
Sully, don't look now, but I think our prayers have been answered.,
Dude, I think we took a wrong turn in Bermuda.
It wont help him if we pick him up. He needs to learn to fly.
You see some strange stuff on these flights to San Francisco.
The Cloud must be full, hate it when that happens.
Picked him up last week. He was on cloud nine.
We know he's not on the 'do not fly' list
Isn't that the guy who wrote HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY?
He and his support tarantula got kicked off.
Used to be I could fly from here to San Diego and not pass one hitch hiker
Ignore him. We learned our lesson last time.
We could pick him up, but unfortunately this is a non-stop.
Wow! That guy’s really high
Maybe we should do another passenger count?
I don't think we can do it. This is a non-stop.
What Crash? I just saw that guy in coach before take off!
He must not know this is a United flight.
This is Major Tom to GroundControl...I think theres something very wrong...with Amazon's Cloud-Service today.
They say it's faster than TSA PreCheck.
Probably doesn't realize this is a non-stop flight
I preferred it when they were just playing the harp...
Here's another one who didn't have enough for the stairway.
Don't bother, Sully. I'm sure he has a towel in that bag.
If we pick him up we can use the car pool lane.
No way am I going to do that Hudson thing again...
It's amazing what they're storing in the cloud these days.
Shall we report an unidentified standing object?
He's got flexible dates.
Yep - the guy sang 'Off we go into the wild blue yonder' one time too many.
Don't stop to pick him up, Bob, he looks high."
Do you think he went through Security?
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking.
If he catches the wing, we can take him as far as St. Louis.
"Another thumbs up for cutting out discounts to the N.R.A.
“That pack is too big for carry on”.
It's getting harder and harder to fly stand-by.
Whoa. God's a hippie?
Ever since Prop 64 passed, the "mile high club" has taken on a whole new meaning.
Wait a sec. Is that... D.B. Cooper?!?
We're nonstop, maybe he should contact UberAir.
Don't let him know this is american airlines
I don't know. He looks high.
Not an angel folks but to your left is a homeless guy caught in the smog along I-5 near LA...we're flying a bit low today.
We could charge more for his bag...
Extra seat? United overbooked again.
Just throw him some pretzels and keep moving.
He must be really high.
He must be flying standby.
He's a galaxy hitchhiker without a guide.
As if
Don’t see too many people moving from ‘The Cloud’ these days.
I've heard of bumping a passenger before a flight, but this is a little much.
The places people to capture Pokémon!
he's got a ticket to ride...
We have a seat in Basic Economy, but I can't believe he's that desperate.
Maybe if he had a clever sign or something.
Nah, let him take the Hoboken ferry like everyone else, Capt. Sully.
That's just Earl.
We can't, it'll mess up our on-time statistics.
Is that DB Cooper?
We gotta stop drinking on these long haul flights.
AND waive the checked bag fee??
Sorry Bud...we've crammed so many people in this plane already, there's no place for you...
I think he is high.
That guy's higher than a kite.
No, I'm not going to call it in!
Tell the folks in the cabin to enjoy the hologram from Turner Classic Movies.
He took Uber with an expired credit card.
I know that horizontal integration of routes makes sense, but Greyhound!....What were we thinking?
He'll never get a ride with that oversize carry-on.
Now there's a fellow who's high in a way that's genuinely literal.
Feck it ..... pull in.
Hello Colorado.
If you don't mind, I'll let you report him, sir.
So now passengers can catch a ride using the Cloud.
Why didn't you tell me I'd be hallucinating if we got this high?
Not-So-Superman?
It's another old hippie who travels on a wing and a prayer.
Jerry never thought he'd find himself up in the clouds. Certainly not hitching from one. He hadn’t bargained on the kids’ trampoline being so springy. It was a long way down, luckily he’d packed snacks. He gave the jet a thumbs up, smile and a wink.
Come to think of it, we do need a rhythm guitarist.
Yes, I've flown over Colorado before. But I never inhaled.
Alright, but if he starts playing 'Spirit in the Sky' we're letting him off again.
This has been happening a lot since California legalized marijuana!
Tower we have a DB Cooper sighting
You'd think that Stephen King could pay full fare.
Woodstock.
We're not the only ones who are high right now...
He knows there's a wing coming, right?
Wow, they still hitchhike to Grateful Dead shows?
He's in luck, today just happens to be, bring a hippie to work day.
It would set a bad precedent.
This happens every time we pass Cloud 9!
I told you there is nothing there...Maybe you shouldn't binge watch the Twilight Zone on Netflix.
Damn it!! There's that guy again!!
We don't need his guide to the galaxy.
We must be getting close to Frisco.
Must be the new fare just below "Basic"..............
I think he'd have better luck if a UFO cruised by.
Some companies are tougher about 'bumping' passengers than others.
We could take him as far as Cloud 9.
These kids are really embracing the cloud.
He must be high.
What do ya think? Should we pick him up? I don't know, he looks pretty high.
I guess we should check the rules manual and see if it’s covered?
I don't pick up hitchhikers. Especially if they are high.
The last plane that didn't pick me up crashed.
We'll pick him up on the way back!
Tell me again why there isn't a female pilot in this cartoon?
No, that bag will never fit in the overhead bin.
Now I get it. 42!
Is that Tom Petty trying to hitchhike back down to earth from heaven?
We’ve been getting a lot of this over Colorado since they legalized cannibus.
He must have lost his guide to the galaxy.
Third one today.
He looks nice, Chet. Let’s pull over...
We're half empty and ahead of schedule. What do ya say, captain?
My gosh, everything's in the cloud now.
Looks like one of the Olympic Snowboarders caught too much "Big Air!"
Maybe we didn't come through that storm as well as we thought.
Boy I'll tell you, standby has become so dangerous.
Things keep getting weird every time that wall keeps growing by ten feet.
Remember when it was safe to pick-up hitchhikers? Now you wouldn't dare.
Let him board and in five minutes he'll be demanding an upgrade!
Every time I fly by heaven fucking Winkler is out there all "Eyyyyyyyy". Hey Fonzie: get a life!
I dunno. He looks a little flighty to me.
Maybe on the way back.
I'd stop, but there's no way to get his backpack through security.
Where the hell does he think we're going?
Flying standby has changed a lot in the past few years.
Is he high, or are we?
Yikes! Either he's high or I am!
It’s the new economy package.
Funny, he doesn't look like Mick Jagger.
Isn't that the same guy from a few miles back? This is getting creepy.
Tell him we need a longer runway to stop.
Back in the 70s, I would have picked him up, but these days, you just don’t know.
Oh, that's Joe. He's always on cloud nine.
I guess he likes your technique.
Go for it 'Sully'. You've defied the odds before.
Flying over the Alps ain't what it used to be.
Don’t panic.
He should have thought of that before saving himself to The Cloud.
Too bad Purgatory isn't one of our scheduled stops.
D. B. Cooper. No wonder they couldn't find him.
That guy must be on cloud nine!
Does he really think that we'd stop to pick up somebody dressed like that?
I thought those Brownies tasted funny.
I must be seeing things. I could swear we passed the same guy over Wichita.
Ass, grass, or helium ...no one rides for free.
19 years ago I would have pulled over.
I've seen this movie, keep going.
Hey, That's Elon Musk. Nothing like the experience of a wind-turbine solar-powered Tesla to bring you out of the clouds!
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him--he's been there since 1972.
This is your captain speaking. Those passengers on the left-hand side of the plane should not be alarmed. Federal aviation regulations prevent us from taking hitchhikers on board.
Maybe he lost his guide to the galaxy?
Looks like another Unidentified Fingering Object to report.
Nah; he doesn't want a lift--that's cloud nine, and he's giving us a thumbs-up
Kerouac way-point to port.
Are the Dead in town?
We are over San Quentin, so we really shouldn't...
He's got enough lifts already.
I'd pick him up but we're a non-stop flight.
That's odd. Usually he's on Cloud Nine.
Have you ever seen the William Shatner Twilight Zone episode?
I'd stop, but that bag would never fit into the overhead bin.
Makes sense, this is cloud number 42
Sorry sir, carry-on bags are not permitted in hitchhiker class.
Hey, isn't that Major Tom?
We’ll have to charge him extra for the bag.
Economy class.
Holy crap, B.D. Cooper!
Unidentified, my foot. That's my uncle Charlie.
Between you and me, I really like this job so let’s keep this to ourselves.
I suppose this is part of that new cloud technology
Spirit Airlines usually picks him up
There’s our ride share.
What a bum!
Tell him "gas, grass, or ass".
I don't know. He looks pretty high to me.
Third we’ve seen today. Must be another cloud migration.
Don't stop.
That's one way to beat airport security!
I don't know Stan, his bag looks bigger than 9 x 14 x 22.
That guy should grab an Uber. Nobody hitchhikes anymore.
Sure...but he's not as annoying as the squeegee guys....
You'd have to be crazy to pick up a hitchhiker who's that high.
Certainly the road less traveled.
I didn’t think anyone still read Doug Adams.
If you want a ride to Los Angeles you need to go to the other side of the air way.
I'm open to cloud commuting but we don't want to get a virus.
No, let's not. The last time we picked up one of those guys, he didn't smell heavenly at all!
Oh look! Fred's ride broke down again
United 123 to Ground; requesting permission to pick-up stranded IT technician.
If he doesn't have a ticket, f*** him.
What’s he doing in secure airspace?
Yup, we're definitely flying over Colorado.
Someone didn't want a body scan.
I heard the "air'uber" website had crashed.
Talk about being high!
We could pick him up, sir. He must have great weed.
It’s the new app, Lyft-Off.
I always wondered whatever happened to Jack Kerouac.
Not again. You remember what happened last time we stopped for one.
We're not stopping — we're already behind schedule.
Keep going, that's what I'd call a flight risk!
If that's Douglas Adams, I want his autograph.
Who the hell is Marty McFly?
Only if he has Global Entry.
Do you think he's headed up or down?
It's just another one who thought there's a stairway FROM heaven.
The FAA should put regulations on air-hikers.
Maybe he confused hijacking with hitchhiking.
have you been reading Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy again?!
Wow, is this dude high
Don't stop. Clearly he's high.
Zoloft is wonderful stuff.
You're telling me Jagger was talking about a real guy?
Wasn’t he there yesterday?
Are we over Colorado already?
I suppose he's trying to get to cloud 9. It is a ways off.
He's probably been thrown out of that United flight a few thousand feet above us.
I thought the sixties were over.
EasyJet customers should really start reading the fine print when booking a non-direct flight.
There goes Mr. Jordan.
Is this part of the random drug test?
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud!
Someone needs to tell him hitchhiking can be dangerous
That's one way to get around TSA.
I've seen Clyde from both sides now.
They used to call them Jesus Freaks......harmless, but we can't pick him up on a "non-stop" flight.
We'd have to put him in first class. There are no seats left in the back.
Looks like he's not free fallin' anymore.
Some folks will do anything to avoid security.
Do we still charge him for the bag?
Hey, look! It's Major Tom!
I was right - Air Traffic Control DID say Airway 51, not Area 51.
Flying standby is not what it used to be.
Did I ever tell you I saw Elvis once?
They're putting everything in the cloud these days.
No Way!! I heard Johnson picked one up last year and now they have him flying out of Newark
I don't know. I picked up one of those guys once and he stank to high heaven.
We’re gonna pick him up alright. He’s about to be our wingman.
This path to citizenship thing is getting ridiculous.
We're not picking him up, Phil. He looks like he's high on something.
We’re seeing more and more of this.
If he's up here, he's probably not on the No Fly List.
Okay, but he'll have to check the bag.
He was really never able to handle the idea that he had failed to Make America Great Again.....
What do you mean, 'We can drop him off on the West Side Highway,' Sully?
I've stopped to pick someone up before... boy, was that a disaster.
Sorry, Federal Regulations prevent us from stopping for Hitchhikers.
That's why we're not allowed to eat the same meal Captain.
Well his thumb is in the right place, because he's going to get the wing without the prayer.
Don't stop for him. I gave him a lift once and he wouldn't stop talking.
Sully, landing on the Hudson was impressive... But it's physically impossible to put this thing on a CLOUD!
Hey buddy a ride is gas, grass or $50 for an extra bag fee
It just wouldn't be fair to everyone who had to wait in line.
Yes, sir, your wife's brownies are very special.
If he can make it all the way up here, I don't know why he needs to hitchhike.
It seems even hitchhiking is in the cloud now
There used to be a lot more.
Yeh, ol' DB Copper will be waiting a long time before we pick him up again.
No, TSA says we can't,
Well, since the aircraft is stopped in midair, why not pick him up. Maybe he knows how to get us going again.
I thought Willie and Neil buckled up.
The last flight that didn't pick me up was Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
It's always that same guy, same cloud.
He's lucky. There's an empty plane right behind us!
I remember when people dressed for flying.
He’s in boarding-group Z.
The plane ahead of us is super economy.
But what if he has over three fluid ounces of liquids?
I told you we were flying too low.
He's using the new iCloud hitchhiking app.
Must be high if he thinks we’re gonna pick him up
We're seeing more iCloud burn-outs every day.
It's the guy from the Twilight Zone.
Pilot: It's DB Cooper on a cloud. He's thumbs up looking like a hitchhiker Ground Control: You found him! Well as long as he's not hijacking, pick him up.
Ok but this time you need to tell him we only have middle seats BEFORE he gets in the plane.
Man, the last guy must’ve really screwed him!
Anywhere but Earth, please!
Don't pick him up, he's obviously high.
Why do they all have to have knee holes in their jeans?
I guess D.B. Cooper finally ran out of money.
I never pick up anyone who looks like he’s high.
If he's in mountain-top snow, we're in trouble! If not, it's even worse.
Don't stop; could be a hijacker.
I'm not so sure he's better off without Garfunkle..
He looks enough like D. B. Cooper that I'm tempted.
You know we are not allowed to pick up hitch-hikers
So this is what it's come down to for Arthur Dent. Still hitchhiking through the galaxy.
Ignore. He's on "Cloud Nine". We have to work.
Hop in, but you'll have to take a middle seat.
No chance that guy stays seated while we taxi to the gate.
No, he looks like he's high
Cloudy with a chance of hitchhikers. The forecast was right on the money again!
It says here, "cloudy, with a chance of moochers."
He's part of the latest fad - it's called "cloud commuting"
Shall we pull over and pick him up?
Heaven can wait
Sometimes they get tired of being stored in the cloud.
One of us is a little too high.
I don't think he understands the gravity of his situation.
Are you going to Cloud Nine?
Just how far out are we?
Mein Gott, he's high as a kite.
For a minute there, I thought I saw a guy hitching a ride to heaven.
HELP! My Uber driver's GPS conked out and he had to drop me off here!
Must be flying standby on one of those discount airlines.
He must have exhausted his frequent flier miles
Think all his liquids and gels are under 3 oz.?
I don't care what the conmercials claim, landing in Buffalo in the heart of winter is unnerving.
Someone that high has got to be a Canadian.
I picked him up last year. He's the sound man in rock and roll heaven.
"Sorry, this is a non-stop flight." Joe Pitts, Washington, DC
Hey, isn't that the same guy we saw over Fresno last week?
"Hey, isn't that the guy from Jefferson Airplane?" Shelley Rodgers Alexandria VA
Look, that's the D.B.Cooper, guy isn't it?
Let's pick him up. I never did see the movie.
He's the guy who wrote the book 'Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy.
Do you really think he wants us to take him to heaven?
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is fiction isn't it?
Told you this would happen when they legalize marijuana.
I think we finally found our Uber rider.
Better not- that guy just doesn't look normal.
Can I ride back with you, Sully?
I didn't know that United flew this route.
I forgot to break my Prozac in half.
Aw...c'mon... you are the fifth plane to come by without stopping.
I dunno. I must've rubbed Elon Musk the wrong way.
Forget it--we're not supposed to open the door at this altitude.
I guess Tim's having a bad day...I know he flies when he's having fun.
Are we still doing super-standby?
Flight’s not full. Let’s give him a lift.
You know, it amazes me what some people will do to try to get a free ride on our airline.
Don't stop. I think he's standby.
Look! Someone is using our new cloud-based ride sharing system!
I guess that's one way of bypassing TSA.
Say...isn't that D.B. Cooper?
We flying over Colorado again?
Looks like another poor soul lost in the cloud, Sir.
That's how I met you... Remember?
He does realize we are descending?
Now will you admit we should have avoided that swirling black hole?!?
«Remember what happened the last time we picked up a hitch-hiker ?»
Don’t, he’s obviously high.
You know those jeans come off the shelf like that?
Oh yeah he's high, ripped jeans, long hair, backpack, he's probably barefoot too!
Seems as though double booking isn't a problem for some airlines!
Our new strict standby rules are for the birds.
What does he think he is, God?
Everything is moving to the cloud.
Flight 568 to Tower...we found Bobby McGee...
Now Skipper, what did your mom tell you about picking up hitch hikers in a strange place?
Keep driving, he looks suspicious!..
Hey, isn't that Douglas Addams?
I bet he got this high for a lot cheaper.
How high is this guy?
I think he should read "Hitchhikers's Guide to the Galaxy."
Must be the guy who's updating "the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy."
Looks like Jerry is still trying to make a comeback.
Negative Captain, he was the bassist for the Butthole Surfers, not Hüsker Dü.
Must be one of those counter culture dudes with his feet in the clouds.
Wow! Looks like the Hipsters are taking sending things to the Cloud to a new level!
Wow, talk about living in the cloud!
I doubt anyone will pick him up in that getup
Don’t stop, I think he’s high.
The Tesla must have konked out.
I'll bet he flew United.
Yes, he used to fly for the airline, but he could never let go
He's now free to move about the atmosphere
Jeez, that takes high as a kite to a whole other level.
We can't. He hasn't been through security.
Wow. Cloud boarding. Modern technology, man.
Let's not pick him up, he's as high as a kite, in fact higher.
Look at this airhead thinking he's getting a ride
He took Douglas Adams way too literally.
I guess privatized space travel has its downfalls after all.
I never pick up people who are that high.
Which one's the altimeter?
That's Doug but I Don't see Eoin.
It looks like we're heading into the same kind of turbulence you experienced in the sixties
Does he look suspicious to you?
What is Hitchin' a Ride by Vanity Fare? I win again, Jones. I've been playing "Clues in the Clouds" a lot longer than you have.
That wing is gonna hurt.
I'm not sure what road he's on, but it's not the one paved with good intentions.
These White House staffers aren't even waiting for Air Force One to land!
Oh, c'mon, it'll make the trip go faster.
Well, he's already got his shoes off...
Ignore him, Captain. He is already in the 7th heaven. In a minute he vapors like a cloud.
Oh! Look - it's D.B. Cooper!
Well, he kept asking for more leg room.
He was singing off key and the flight attendant told him to play outside.
"Forty-two" - some hitchhiker
Looks like the Russians have hacked into our Cloud
Must be that Hitchhiker to the Galaxy I've heard about...
...only if he has enough frequent flyer miles, Sully.
We gotta get out of this place. If it’s the last thing we ever do
There's another one! Ever since The Wall went up, it's been crazy up here.
Don't get any ideas, Sully.
But even if that were possible, where would you fit his bag?
That’s the new Basic Fare.
NRA members are really struggling to get flights.
I don't think so captain. I can't see his shoes.
It's the latest thing in cloud-based ride sharing.
He sent himself to "my" cloud by mistake.
This is your pilot, we are now passing over Colorado.
But what if he has a water bottle?
If we stop to pick up one hitchhiker we'll have to stop for them all!
Do you see that Johnson? These shades DO make look cool! That dude just gave me a thumbs up!
I wonder if that's D. B. Cooper
Just wing it.
Standbys are getting very creative!
His duffle bag is too big for a carry-on.
Boarding group 9. And all rows. You can now board.
Tell me that's a cloud he's on and not a snow bank...
All we have left is First Class.
I guess we are flying over Colorado now.
We can take you as far as LaGuardia.
Another one uploaded to the cloud and forgot his password.
Walt Disney said to beware of hitchhiking ghosts
Tell him we’re only going as far as Cloud 8.
And they say men won’t ask for help when they’re lost.
Once the Tesla roadster was launched, cloud hitch hiking was bound to follow.
Yeah, but then we would have to charge him a baggage fee.
Of all days for Shattner to have missed a flight.
I think we need a bigger wall...
I told you, we're not stopping til we get there.
I mean, Jones says he's TSA Pre-Check, but you just can't trust anyone these days.
"He broke the first rule of retail: "Never get high on your own supply.'".
How do we know he'd clear a TS.A. scan?
Cloud computing pays well, but the commute is tricky.
Never saw anyone more patient to get on "standby ".
No way. You heard what happened to Amelia right?
Now you know why I don't trust the cloud.
Isn't that your old back pack he's wearing?
Wow! I wonder what he's smoking? Must be the Ultimate High!
Hey, Captain, was that Jack Kerouac ‘On The iCloud’?
those Canadians get around....
Now this takes standby to a whole new level.
Keep going. He looks like he's high on something.
Cloud commuter. Router glitch.
Finally, an answer to the D. B. Cooper mystery
I'm guessing UberAir isn't a thing yet then
Sorry buddy, these skies are not friendly.
He must have read “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”
Let's not pick him up, he looks really high.
Sorry, we only have middle seats.
This is what the iCloud Drive Service could have been.
Do you think he is TSA precheck?
Do you think he has a guide to the galaxy?
Keep going Mike, no way he can afford our carry on baggage fee.
Don't stop! He looks seriously high.
Don't worry, he's on a cloud source platform.
Just another voter who was promised the sky.
Did you give any more thought to that early retirement scheme?
They call him the Flying Coachman.
Ugh, another UBER Air rider?! This sharing economy is getting ridiculous.
Wow! A rare Jets fan!
Up here they need both wings and a prayer.
Another Standby!
Too scruffy. Maybe the next one.
My mother said not to stop and ;ick up hitchhikers
Actually, I did once, but he only wanted to use the restroom.
Is he flying our super basic economy?
I get it, the fare is cheap, but is it really worth the layover?
Stranger Danger!
I know the guy. He can afford a ticket but he finds this more challenging.
The cheapest ticket got me only till here.
Hey Captain, first one we've seen trying to get off of Cloud Nine.
On a wing and a prayer!!!
Don't pick him up. He's too high.
He'd have to check that backpack.
They must have just legalized it in California.
He can't handle the long layover in Nirvana.
Is he telling us good job?
Another backpacker is stranded on cloud nine...
Just when I thought I understood “on the cloud”
Is he always that upbeat?
We could stop but I'm not sure his bag fits in the overhead.
Ugh, nobody’s stopping. I knew I should have dressed up as a chick.
I'm putting in for vacation as soon as we land.
Don't even think of it, Sully! If you tell anyone, neither of us will ever fly again!
Keep going. That bag will never fit in the overhead bins.
OMG! It's Major Tom. He lost his tin can.
He's never going to get picked up with a carry-on that large.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now passing Cloud 9.
Captain , Can you recheck fuel gage please
We're at 50,000 feet. What could possibly happen if we stop for him?
Could I hitch a ride with you while my cloud backs up?
Ghost Riders these days just aren’t what they used to be.
Poor guy he's been on the no-fly list since he was born, understand God couldn't do much about it either
Whew, Paul … I guess #metoo skipped us and got Heaven instead …
"Amazing he is TSA Pre approved".
SLC Tower, this is American 1542. We may have found D. B. Cooper.
Get ready for cloud commuting!
These standby passengers just don’t give up.
Apple sent me to the cloud. I need to get back.
Normally I would say yes...but something about him seems a bit shady.
Boy, his arm must be tired
We actually are about eight miles high
Didn't we bump him this morning?
We can take you as far as LaGuardia.
Where can I find what he's smoking?
We’d have to gate check that pack.
I wouldn't stop for him.
Damn! I think that's D. B. Cooper!
Don’t stop. This guy looks shady.
Don't Captain, he hasn't been screened by TSA.
Don't look left, just keep going!
It looks like an Uber driver took him to the wrong place.
"Wasn't he in the exit row on yesterday's flight/'
Looks like the virtual reality exhibit is facing some budget cuts.
Radio that they can stop looking for D.B Cooper
Don’t do it. This guy looks high.
The Hitchhiker’s guide to no gravity.
Let's keep going. He's too high.
Forget it. He's high.
I thought you said that this flight would go off without a hitch!
Keep going. The skies are not that friendly.
Must be flying on points.
Don't stop: that carry-on looks too big.
Ok, so you see him too?
Flying standby is not what it used to be.
It's the airline's newest version of standby.
Hitchhike, highjack. I always get those two mixed up.
....seven...eight...yup, its cloud nine
It's easier if you don't make eye contact.
The new mileage program has its drawbacks.
It's best to pretend you don't see fellow travelers.
We can't stop, the only spare seat we have is in Business Class.
Don't stop. It looks like he's headed up.
I want some of what he's on.
Don't pull over, he looks high.
The hitchhiker's guide to the friendly skies
The wind feels better out here.
Going my way?
Our destination city has some really good weed!
He looks dangerous, I say no.
Sorry, this is a non-stop flight.
Maybe we should pick him up. Sometimes they carry a guide to the galaxy.
With our maintenance record you wouldn't think there were unemployed gremlins.
Help the homeless, help the needy, help the immigrants, help the guy floating in the sky on a cloud....jeez, Larry, where does it all end?
Just tryin’ to get offa my cloud.
Working on his guide to the galaxy.
Ignore him. It’s a promotion for the re-release of ‘The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.’
Sorry, we're headed thumbs down.
Corporate sent out a warning about left wing hitchhikers.
I thought the Cloud was supposed to reduce Airline Congestion.
Gotta be standby out of Denver.
You can always tell when you enter Colorado airspace.
At least someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Someone wants airplane ride.
That dude's always on Cloud Nine. I learned early on to pass him by.
"I guess he couldn't get a direct flight".
No need to stop. He's already on cloud nine.
Never pick them up when they are on the left side of the road.
Normally I stop for those guys but there's a purgatory near here.
Another one who thought he could go off the grid in the cloud.
The company rules are very clear: no stopping for anyone cloud hopping.
Who hitchhikes anymore?
This is in our living will.
Don't stop.
I don't think his bag will fit in the overhead bins.
Yeah, I see him too. Last time he was asking for spare change.
Economy class is just not what it used to be.
Another member of the mile high club
You see these guys whenever it's cloudy over Portland.
Help me get higher.
Looks like he already got a lift.
I don't know, he looks pretty high.
Last week some cloud hopper tried to squeegee the windshield.
It's so sad when someone realizes that cloud nine is just another cloud.
Don't be dramatic, I'm sure there's an empty overhead compartment for his carry on.
I hate storing things on the cloud.
Cloud 9?
I'm sorry sir, that carry on exceeds 18 inches.
Hitchhiker to the galaxy? I've already seen that movie.
I'd stop, but this flight is overbooked.
Dude! Cloud COMPUTING. Not commuting.
Who took the LSD - us or him?
That’s a first!
Isn't that your son-in-law?
It's the Colorado effect.
Don't swing around. He's a member of the NRA.
Fly Me to the Moon
We should pick him up. He's got smokehouse almonds in that backpack.
Is it just me, or have things gotten stranger since California legalized pot?
If nothing else, that DB Cooper is tenacious.
I say we pass him. There must be a reason the last plane let him off there.
Should we stop and pick him up? He might have extra tickets to the Grateful Dead concert.
Y'know, it's a shame Rod Serling made them out to be such bad guys...
Don’t worry. By tomorrow he’ll come down on his own.
What's the worst that could happen if we stopped to pick him up?
The pilot's manual strongly advises against stopping to pick up hitchhikers.
Reminds me of an old hippie joke about Nixon
Does he really need a ride or is he just giving us a thumb's up?
We have one seat left in first class...let him catch el cheapo airlines behind us.
I knew they shouldn't have legalized it!
And I thought his Guide to the Galaxy was just a metaphor.
Oh! There’s D B Cooper !
His carry-on is over the limit.
Sully, don't get any fancy ideas. We're going by the book here.
Doggone kids today eh?
Well, that is one way to get around security.
I finally got used to trusting the cloud but I really think that could be a bum steer.
Since the economic downturn, passengers have found it increasingly difficult to fly standby.
He's not dressed for this altitude.
A lot less traffic since morals have decreased.
This cloud storage thing is getting ridiculous.
He doesn’t have a prayer
Just pretend you didn’t see him!
Keep going. That guy looks flighty.
The ghost of DB Cooper has to hang out someplace, but this is creepy.
Don’t let him get caught in the engine like those darn birds.
He looks creepy, let’s not stop
Not even for Neil Young?
Is Jack Kerouac at it again?
..these guys always get me...how the heck do they expect us to stop.
SOMEONE sure has a lot of storage!
Uber has just gone too far.
Homeless on cloud 9. Need help to Homeless on cloud 9. Need to get back to earth.
If we pick him up we will be late to where we are going.
Did you read a hitch hikers guide to the galaxy ?
...are you sure Captain? I really think we should give him a lift
Its Trump’s nominee for secretary of NASA!
I hear that more and more folks work in the cloud these days.
You're right Captain. Air sickness pills can have a strange effect on the imagination. At least I stopped throwing up.
To SpaceX
What do you mean you’ve never read “ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Universe”?
He needs to get one of those cardboard signs.
What do you think: is he trying to hitch a ride or giving us a thumbs up?
Traffic in sight. It looks as if he just came up inside a cyclone!
Are you sure that LSD button indicates Large Screen Display?
He's out there every trip.
1. Hey Sully, with the river so close, we really don't have time to pick up any more hitchhikers ...
Captain, a hitchhiker on cloud 9.
No, I'm not pulling over. I really don't think he's going anywhere. Anyone who can stand on a cloud is just showing off.
Looks like one of the Clinton campaign volunteers trying to hitch a ride back to reality.
“ I’ve seen that before. It’s a vertibratus cirrus”.
Man, people will do anything to avoid airport security checks!
Keep driving, he looks like he's on cloud nine.
Another digital nomad taking up space on the cloud.
Captain, we can’t give him a seat unless he cleared security.
We're headed to Orange County. They'll just send him back.
Oh my God, we’re on the highway to heaven.
If I were on Cloud 9, I wouldn't want to leave, would you?
Well, I DON'T think he looks like a terrorist, and I'm picking him up.
I don’t think he is TSA approved.
Don't bother. That bag is definitely too big for carry-on.
IDK . . . can we believe a guy who's too old to be wearing ripping-jeans?
Who picks up hitchhikers anymore?
Maybe not this time. I heard he was under a cloud.
But he hasn't cleared TSA.
"Another dude with 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' in his backpack.
I wonder what happens if he points it down?
I remember him! I told him yesterday to step outside if he wanted to smoke.
I haven't seen this, since I started flying the 'Woodstock' route.
I understand he was killed by the side of the road.
He looks lost, better not pick him up.
Sees ya next time!
The friendliest Place to Live.
He says he's fine, keep flying
They get to cloud nine but then have to hitchhike home.
Nice, Elan Musk has inspired this new stop on the Marrakesh Express
We're in an airplane. What's the worst that can happen?
His bag will never fit in the overhead compartment.
You have to wonder how they get through security.
I don't know how they even wind up on clouds eight and ten.
Flying monkeys still scare the crap out of me.
Don’t stop. Last time I picked one up he talked non-stop to Honolulu.
you're good son. by the way, I'm the sky traffic controller. What's your name?
hey guys, you're all good. by the way, I'm the sky traffic controller. who are you?
The weather forecast called for severe wind updrafts today
Damn Millennials, they are so lazy, won’t even go through security.
There he is again.
Sure looks like Arthur Dent.
Where does he expect us to land?
Just keep flying, it's just that D.B. Copper jerk again.
Are you carrying more than 3 ounces of cloud water?
Nah....his carry-on looks too big.
Welp, that settles it, everything's in the cloud these days.
And to your left you can see cloud nine.
Even St. Peter is cutting back on travel expenses.
Sorry pal. Picture yourself in a boat on a river.
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", get your copy here!!!
No that's not Jerry Garcia. Are you high?
There's one of the few survivors from the sixties.
Yeah, I used to pick up hitchhikers, too, but, you know, one too many weird experiences.
I'm willing to give this air head a little latitude.
TSA Pre-check
Pull over, it's my Grampa. I knew he didn't understand when I told him to store his music on the cloud!
Come on, Cal. He doesn't have a choice of many airlines to fly.
"Should we pick him up"?
Sir, he certainly has come up in the world. Last week, I heard, he was walking on water.
Gary Larson called he wants his joke back
You seen how many steps that Stairway to Heaven has?
I'm not sure you'll ever sell me on the ease of retrieving from The Cloud, Ken.
Look, it's Ford Prefect.
They are getting so strict about frequent flier miles running out.
The hitchhikers guide to frequent flyer miles.
Keep driving. He'll never afford the checked baggage fee.
That's one way to avoid a TSA pat-down.
It's Arthur Dent, coming home.
This might be awkward, but in case that’s God, you mind giving up the co-pilot seat?
What do you think, drone or stoner?
I dont know captain, I am concerned he's "High on something"
Graham says I have to go...
Going up?
...I thought the simulator covered every contingency...
Yeah, but in my dream, all the passengers had legroom.
Perhaps overly inspired by that hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy?
Just ask yourself, "What would Sully do?"
Ignore him. That guy is higher than a kite.
No, I think he's just saying 'good job flying that thing.'
Ok, I guess this guy's the limit.
Fool me once, Clark Kent...
A soon-to-be ‘?wing-tipped sky-tumbler,’ I'm afraid.
It's hard to tell if he had taken his shoes off.
Not only is he without a boarding pass, but I bet he hasn't gone through the TSA checkpoint either.
The "scattered crowd" forecast wasn't a typo.
Look, another one fed up with the long wait in purgatory.
Yup, the clouds are definitely thickening.
Some guys just don't want to pay the landing fee on the budget airlines.
I don't report UFO, or D. B. Cooper sightings.
Don't even think about it: it is commendable that you were able to land on your feet after being Trump's pilot, but you can't save that guy--running the FAA requires a different skill set!!!
Shirely he can't expect us to pull over.
Lift to cloud nine?
Say... what's a hipster doing way up here in a cloud bank>
Just another fan of your movie, Sully.
Personally, I'd stop. The risk is worth the baggage fee and he'll ride in the back.
I know we shouldn't...but it's Neal Young!
I blame Douglas Adams.
We can’t really stop; we’ll just have to wing it.
I thought hitchhiking was outlawed.
Jesus, Shmeezus, this is a no-boarding zone.
Well we could pullover, but then the other 150 passengers could be sucked out the door. Your call Captain.
That's our new Basic Economy boarding process.
Oops. I wish our wing were a little shorter.
Nah . . . The "cloud" only stores stuff like files, photos, and recipes. No people.
That's the problem working in the cloud; commuting.
Let’s not stop. I think he’s high.
He's giving us the thumbs up, we're good to go
I thought they only did data!
Keep going, he looks high.
That's Douglas Adams - don't make eye contact! If we pick hm up, who knows where we'd wind up.
That’s me when I retire....
Looks like another one has been transferred to the cloud!
Shame there are no empty seats. Give him a thumbs up anyway.
Looks like he's stuck on cloud eight.
For sure that's too big for carry-on.
Watch that wing!
Psssst...are we dead?
Looks like we have another freak went flyer on stand by.
"Wasn't he a space cadet in his former life, too?
Captain, Google Maps identifies it as "Cloud Nine."
I believe he IS on the stairway to heaven.
I think the company's 'pay as you go' plan needs a few tweaks.
Can't blame the guy. Rent on a studio apartment in Heaven has increased ninety percent over the last three years.
didn't we see him trying to board before we left JFK
@jumbocockpit ‘When all at once...’ #wanderingcloud
You know what they say: The grass is always greener on the other cloud.
I always figured cloud 9 for a lonely place.
Only if he chips in for gas.
Looks like he’s on cloud 9 . Better not stop
I never download anything from the cloud.
Tell him there will be extra charge for the backpack.
Let him go, Bernie. He's only on cloud 6. You know we don't pick up anybody below cloud 9.
That must be the new iCloud app I heard about.
Whaddaya know! We're already Yellow Springs already. Must have a tailwind.
Could be the Devil in hippie clothing.
Ok Jim.. What did you put in my Red Bull this time?!
Is it possible maybe Jack Kerouac DIDN'T go to hell?
I think he is trying to join the mile hitch 'high'king club.
I wish we'd never started this rideshare program.
Boarding Group 9 has his work cut out for him.
Can you help a guy who's out of cloud storage?
Still needs a lift down to Yasgur’s farm?
I think we're too close to the lake again, Captain.
Need a descent?
OMG that’s Ufo.
I'm sorry sir, but your backpack is too big for our overhead compartments.
Oh oh, is William Shatner on board?
The last time we picked him up, for days the cockpit smelled like reefer.
Let us give him a ride; hitchhiking is legal here.
We’re going to Portland, why not?
I don't think so, Don, he looks really high..
Did you see that homeless angel?
Looks like he uploaded too much of his personal information to the cloud.
Don’t stop. He’s high as a kite.
No room, we over book.
Jerry Garcia went from truckin' to cloudin'.
I never trust anyone over thirty thousand feet.
Ask him if he’s willing to pitch in for gas.
Keep driving, she looks nothing like her OKCupid photo.
He does know this isn't Spirit Airlines right?
'If we keep really quiet, he might not cirrus'
Cloud 9 must not be as great as they say.
How high are we right now Rob?
Typical back packer, trying to travel on a tight budget.
Oh.. in that case, we usually just call it in as a "bird strike."
The TSA is not going to like this!
He's a clean looking lad, to bad we're fully booked.
Looks like he could be high.
Don't be fooled by the hidden parachute. It is not a backpack - ignore him. He will try to fly for free.
Have you cleared security?
Well a hitchhiker REALLY isn't something you see everyday. It looks like he fell right out of the 60s.
Don't stop. He looks like he's high to me.
'He looks ok but I might have clouded judgement.'
New age hippies and their existential traveling are becoming a menace.
Gee, I'm having a serious flashback to my youth. You better handle the controls.
I'm not a right wing Republican!
Don't pick him up. FAA Reg. 213. He could be a terrorist in disguise!
I feel sorry for him. All the flights on this route are overbooked.
Don't stop. That thumb isn't in a full upright and locked position.
We must be above Amsterdam.
Look, another hitchhiker to the galaxy
Cloud Nine has really done downhill in this economy.
How "high" do you think he is ?
That guy never should have said "Galaxy."
Just ignore him.. he's one of those nutjob Galaxy Hitchhiker wannabes always making jokes about Uranus.
Think of the paperwork if we stop.
He’ll be OK. The Tesla will pick him up.
Normally I'd stop, but that backpack isn't going to fit in the overhead bin
There for the grace of God go I.
Are you sure you want to come with us? We are on our way to hell.
No telling what he has in that duffel.
Safety and airline fees are not factors, besides, he has heaven's blessings.
More cost-cutting at 'Chutes-R-Us, I see.
Head in the clouds, and feet, too.
Quick, roll up the windows
Yeah, I'd hitchhike all over... but that was different lifetime. Why?
Don't stop. This is how Cold Blood started.
Thumbs up to heaven
It's Timothy Leary!
Let's leave him in the 70s with Truth, Justice and the American Way.
Your right, the flight manual say's "not to pick up hitchhickers while in the air."
Lift to New York?
I told you cloudsourcing passengers was a bad idea.
Looks like a Byrd strike to me, Sully.
We're Budget Air not Budget Bus.
Good job, guys!
We have just reached er...weirdo heaven.
Pull over, I know that guy.
He must have taken "cloud computing" literally.
Don't stop! That might be DB Cooper.
That's the new TSA pre-check.
Must have had a much tougher life than the guy we passed on Cloud 9.
My goodness! This takes the cake for getting a support animal on board.
I’ve seen more and more of them since Colorado legalized marijuana.
That's DB! Looks like the money didn't do him much good, should have invested it.
Keep driving, he seems high.
The marijuana’s stronger than it used to be.
I think we've been listending to too much Jefferson Airplane.
I've only made that mistake once.
Don't make eye contact. They're always going our way, but they can never pay the carry-on charge.
It's the only way for some angels to get their wings.
Sorry we don’t stop at the pearly gates.
I guess heaven can wait
He looks like a terrorist. Don't pick him up.
He's probably just going as far as Cloud Nine.
You know -- that guy who wrote 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
He probably just hates going through airport security.
Look John! Another hippie trying to hitch hike his way to Mars.
Might have a gun.
Guess Mexico wouldn't fund the "Stairway to Heaven" either.
Please tell me this is a simulation.
Now, that's some killer weed.
""Oh Carl don't be such a party pooper stop and give the guy a ride''
Wow, D.B. Cooper is looking old.
He hasn't got a hope in hell
I heard about him. He is tired of having to play a harp all the time.
Looks like Buck Rodgers missed the plane.
He took it pretty hard when Holy Trinity broke up over creation differences.
We can't pick him up. He looks high.
If he’s supposed to be my replacement, at least he could have dressed the part.
Another United passenger kicked off the airplane.
He's avoiding economy class
Can I hitch a ride and the friendly skies of United ?
I bet Sully would've picked him up.
Should we pick him up?” “I don’t think so, he looks higher than we are.
I saw that movie. Pretty good.
There goes the neighborhood.
No boarding pass and overhead compartments are full.
Looks like Arlo’s just retrieved some data.
I'd stop, but there's no place to pull over...
It's a shame that we don't fly to San Jose.
Rule #1. Never pick up a hitchhiker.
We’re seeing a lot more of these guys since recreational marijuana became legal.
He took early retirement so he could travel.
I've heard of flying standby, but not standing flyby.
Looks like the end of the line for the Stairway to Heaven.
Only if he helps pay for gas.
Okay, it’s your call but I have to remind you of Delta’s official policy: “Gas, grass or ass. No one rides for free.”
We just don't have room in the overhead bins for that carryon.
I couldn’t afford the surge.
So much for TSA approved.
I hate the Cloud Nine route!
Wow! It’s been a while since I’ve seen one of those!
Probably an old hippie, everyone else gave up hitch hiking in the late '70s.
Just left the Trump Administration. Need a ride back to sanity.
Really bad layover.
It’s him again.
You'd think he'd have learned not to hitchhike anymore after having been raped, murdered and dumped at the side of the road.
Dip the port wing or we’ll have hitchhiker all through the engine.
Sure, pull over and pick this guy up. He's gonna have to pay the $25 baggage fee for that back pack though.
Pass him by. The guy a few clouds down has a cute pup with him.
OK by me, as long as he chips in for gas.
It's another baby boomer - they even try to get a free ride in the afterlife.
He'll have to wing it.
Let's give him a ride; he played with the Jefferson Airplane.
Sorry -- bag's too big for carry-on.
He wants to return to the Planet of the Apes
My Uber app says that's him.
"It's Elon Musk, his Tesla will pick him up".
he must be high on life
Doesn't he know this is a nonstop flight?
Look Paul, another sucker got lost trying to find Cloud Nine
Maybe heaven isn't all it's cracked up to be.
We've noticed an increase since the recreational marijuana laws passed.
Yo. Pick me up and we can exchange stories about flying high.
I'm pretty sure that guy is high.
So the Stones ment it literally.
Oh look, it's the new Hoboeing 24/7.
I know where that is. Just hang an up at the next corner
Why leave Cloud 9 ?
I see our new standby policy is in effect.
Folks, we've reached cruising altitude. And if you look out to your left, you'll see my deadbeat brother still relying on me for everything.
Just act like you don't see him. Maybe he'll fly away.
Fine. Just tell him to keep his tray table up.
Probably the last Delta employee leaving Atlanta.
Oh, did you hear--they started bumping passengers mid-flight.
I don,t think the oxygen gauges are working.
Mirages just aren't as good as they used to be.
See how high he's going.
This ride sharing thing is getting out of hand.
Pity, another poor fella stuck on cloud nine!
I'd stop but I'm afraid the jets would suck him in
Please don’t stop this time, Fred.
Man, is he high or what?
I think it’s Led Zeppelin trying to catch a ride on the stairway to heaven.
Another frequent flier who ran out of miles...
At least he's not thumbs down.
Do you think he's going up, or down?
Looks like he only had enough mileage for half a flight.
I tried to tell him no-one goes to Cloud 9 any more.
Now that’s what I call ‘standby.’
I dig his wandering spirit, but I'm just not sure what the TSA policy is on hitching these days.
New York Center, 784 with you at Angels 43.
Looks like he got caught up in that funky shit goin' down in the city after all." "Well, it's there that he has to stay.
I'm on cloud 9, man
Now that I understand. It's cloud computing that I can't begin to fathom.
It's a lifestyle choice. He could could have stayed on board.
I promised my Mom that I'd never pick up hitchhikers.
No. That backpack wouldn't fit in an overhead compartment.
And yet somehow, thought the pilots, a hitchhiker on a cloud was less alarming than Trump's latest tweetstorm.
He’s taking up up and away to a whole new level.
Timothy Leary or not, I wouldn’t pick him up.
If he REALLY wanted to impress me he'd show some gas money.
Don't stop. The last time I picked him up he complained about the cramped leg room and no space left in the overhead to stow his bag.
I guess that's where the stairway to heaven ends...
Isn't that the same guy that jumped out over Utah last week?
Sir, I believe we've entered Oregon airspace.
Someone is pretty high.
Can’t pick him up. His bag’s too big for carry on.
I have a feeling that Uber is only available somewhere else
Check altitude.
What’s the company policy on hitchhikers?
I don't know what we should do, this situation never came up in the flight simulator.
He probably changed his mind about staying with the car.
Him? That's D.B. Cooper. He's still looking for a way down.
He's just after our inflight beverage service! Tomorrow he'll be back on the same cloud!
Another billionaire in search of authenticity.
Great, three more hours of you humming Get Off Of My Cloud.
We could forcefully drag someone off to make room.
Man! There's a desperate dude. He must know we don't go there.
Let's keep going, maybe he won't notice us.
Roger tower. Left at vagrant in snow pile and taxi to runway two-six...
What the hell kind of mushroom was in that beef stroganoff?
Well, thank goodness he's not in a lawn chair. No one would believe us.
Never mind. That backpack is too big to carry on anyway.
Titanium status has its perks
We must have died and gone to heaven. I've always wanted to be an airline pilot.
Not until he goes through TSA.
Lets pick him up, maybe he can tell us where we are going.
Just throw him some packs of those tiny pretzels or something
I don't know... He looks like a hippie and he's definitely high.
Will work as flight assistant for free ride.
Could you give me a lift? My uber car cancelled.
We're now helping to retrieve cloud data storage?
Can I hitch a ride to Cloud Nine.
Open the door, I'll get out the security terminal.
Hey what’s that guy doing in the Hudson?
I guess cloud 9 isn't for everyone.
Wow, I saw him standing their on the way in. I think it's a scam and he just wants a handout. He knows no one can give him a ride up here.
Thank GAWD we left the Paris agreement. This pollution cloud just SAVED MY LIFE!
If we pick him up, he'll never earn that other wing.
Cloud commuting! What'll they think of next?
That's the same guy Ed! Do you still think I'm paranoid?
Does he need a ride or he is just happy to see us?
Do you know how dangerous it is to pick up hitchhikers, sir?
What does he think this is? The plane to heaven?
It's Roger Ebert and he likes us!
Well, the weather did say to expect strong updrafts.
That's the third one this week!
Don't even consider it, Sully.
It's been like this ever since "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
He looks 'NRA.' Keep going.
I told him he'd be happier on Cloud 8!
Don't stop. Looks Army. They are never alone!
It's opposite day.
But can we waive the baggage fee?
Who's tripping?
Don't pick him up. He's probably a terrorist!
Ladies and gentleman, we remind you that this is a non-hitching flight.
Don't stop. He probably has bird flu.
I guess the Woodstock Nation couldn't live forever!
Even if he promised not to play, we still can't brake in mid-air.
My take, the dude wants to go to Heaven, shall we?!
Go ahead, but I'll have to bump the passenger in 34F.
I'd stop, but I don't think his carry on would fit in the overhead compartment.
I don't trust anything uploaded to the cloud.
Don’t worry, Sir, that’s just one of those outcasted journalists, trying to hitch a ride to heaven.
Wow, even cloud storage has its limits.
Another one from the Pearly Gates Basic plan.
Thumbs up...now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Wow, the sky really is the limit!
Have you read "Hitchhiker's Guide.."
Sorry buddy, this is a nonstop flight.
So God does have a sense of humor.
Back in the day, we could pick them up without worrying about getting hijacked.
I'm afraid if we don't pick him he'll give us a bad Uber rating.
I wouldn't pick up this guy. He looks really high.
The ascent to heaven is a little more difficult than I thought.
That guy's got his head in the clouds if he thinks we're gonna pull over.
And you two said I would never get my wings!
Pick him up! He can pay half the gas!
I've seen this more and more over Colorado since they legalized marijuana.
Isn't he the same guy on the ground who always needed "jut seven dollars" to get to Oxnard..??
I dunno, Ted. He could just be trying to take us for peanuts, pretzels, or a cookie.
Don’t pick him up
Yesterday I saw him trying to enter the Pearly Gates.
He looks okay, but you never know about drifters.
Personally, I like the new air traffic controller concept.
Isn't that the guy we dragged out of Economy?
Now boarding zone 32.
I'd pick him up if he wasn't high.
I think we're lost--maybe we can ask him if he has a guide to the galaxy.
I always suspected cloud 9 would suck
We're not picking him up. He's definitely high.
Why not? He's travelling light.
They demand an aisle seat.
Looks like he is high.
Douglas Adams is going to find his own damn way to his next stop.
It's Douglas Adams! He wrote the Hitchhiker's Guile to the Galaxy. Let's go back an pick him up.
That guy is way high.
Okay, then. So who is Jerry Garcia?
No, the last time I stopped to pick him up, we lost altitude.
Sorry, Purgatory is as close as we get.
He's not as bad as the squeegee guys.
As long as he's not checking any bags, I'm ok with it
Questions? Oh yes, I have lots of questions?
This new airline auditing system is a crock.
Just ignore him; he does it all the time to avoid to pay the fare!
So this guy named Santa, takes Trump’s advice, and the next thing you know...
And those seated on the left side of the aircraft will notice the free loader on Cloud 9.
Hey, Joe, we can't pick him up, besides breaking the law of gravity, he must be so full of hot air, he'll have us asleep before we land.
My daughter works at Google. She told me it can be dangerous to put all your trust in the cloud.
I did’nt think they allowed any hitchhikers on the highway to heaven
Surprised he can even hold out his thumb, as high as he is.
What's he up to?
With fares soaring we’re going to see more of these.
It's Douglas Adams.
Tell him we only have a middle seat available.
I've always wondered which cloud was No. 9.
DID THE TESLA BREAK DOWN ?
Have you noticed how clouds can resemble people?
Another fallen angel.
I heard St. Peter is casting out Trump voters right and left.
We picked the wrong day to stop drinking!
I never knew there was an app for hitch hiking in the cloud.
Don't stop Captain! He's higher than a kite.
This sky looks like he needs a ride.
I’ m a little high. Can I hitch a ride?
Wait...should he be worried or should we?
U F Off!
Looks like he is high.
But captain...How will we gate check his bag?
You get used to it. There's one around every cloud anymore
I changed my mind. I don't need the NRA discount.
He’s high. Ignore him.
Isn't that the guy who wrote HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY?
I think 14F's open.
I've heard of no-frills airlines but this is ridiculous.
Sorry, this is a non-stop flight.
He’s going to want my second stroopwafel. Don’t stop.
Tell him we're overbooked but there's another plane just behind this one.
Not with that haircut.
Poor guy. Another one who didn't read the fine print on the Apple update.
Poor guy. Got the cloud, but not the wings.
Well, under the new FAA "deregulation", we can pick up hitchhikers, and the airline is looking for more revenue. The problem might be the carry-on bag.
Uhhh Houston .... We have a problem!
We'd have to drop him off in Amsterdam.
I didn't realize iCloud archives went as far back as the '60's.
Well that's not the finger most passengers use.
When he said he wanted to get high, we didn’t think he meant 30,000 feet.
Cloud Nine's not one of our stops. It's not the first time and somebody ought to tell him. Sad.
There, I told you Gary - same spot every week.
You mean all that comb-over blond hair was a wig after all?
If he is going to heaven or hell he must go through Atlanta.
We will have to watch out flying over Colorado.
Oh. So that's what 'the cloud' is all about.
Don't stop. We're an express flight.
Isn't that Cloud 9? Why would he need a lift?
- giimme a break, dudes -am I chopped liver or what...?
He must have used the Cloud when he purchased his ticket.
I guess he’s tired of Cloud 9.
I never stop for those Cloud 9 guys.
I thought they had a guide to the galaxy and this guy is stuck on cloud 8.
The only empty seat is in first class.
Guess that musician stood in the middle of the Highway To Heaven....
I don't think we could stop for him even if we wanted to.
Don't stop! I don't like the looks of that backpack
I guess Heaven was not what he expected.
Don't stop. I make it a rule to never pick up strangers.
What? You think I hiked all the way up here for the view!?
Looks like someone lost his Guide to the Galaxy.
That guy's only ride is on a wing and a prayer!
Must've clapped after take-off.
Have you heard about the new stand-by policy?
Tell him it’s a full flight.
Uh, U.H.O. off the port side.
Looks like business on Cloud 9 is picking up.
Just don't make eye contact and maybe he won't notice us.
No, not going back down there. Do you have any alternative destinations?
Captain, I recommend we do not report this.
Just toss him some peanuts.
I guess heaven can wait
Not quite, captain. Altimeter says we're only seven miles high.
Didn't we drop him off yesterday?
The last time I stopped for him was a disaster.
We see them frequently. That hitchiker’s guide has some real errors.
Call for Mr. Jagger...we've spotted another interloper.
Don't pick him up he burned Uber.
Air traffic control says he's headed back to the 70s.
That guy is obviously high.
...fuck him...just another Catholic who’s lost his way up from purgatory...
Tell him sorry, it's a direct flight.
He should have read 'iCloud for Dummies'!
This new marijuana must be great. In my day you could never get this high.
You don’t see a lot of can’t-be-cirrus clouds below eighteen thousand feet!
Remember when he only flew on Air Force One?
I thought they did away with Cloud 9 rules
I heard he's trying to write a sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
If that's God, are we going his way?
Something tells me we're not going to Cleveland.
I told you not to encourage him at the Admirals Club. Marakesh is so not on the way.
Don't stop, he hasn't been through TSA
Isn't Woodstock the other way?
He's going up not down.
He's obviously higher than a kite.
Standby passengers will try anything these days.
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=190760691529858&id=162758827663378
'Looks like my wife just backed up our son to the cloud.'
Are you heading up or down?
Can we do that thing where we slow down and look like we are going to give him a ride, and then accelerate away when he tries to get in?
Apparently, Heaven's not all it's cracked up to be.
Should we feel skepticism that he's not on the beam?
Does he know "Sully" retired?
Quick! Swerve like you’re going to hit him.
Is That Hugh Hefner? Hey, Hugh get off my cloud
He probably wants to go to cloud ten
Hey, isn't that your brother Richard?
He got busted for smoking weed.
Stop! Isn't that Charlie? I went to flight to flight school with him.
Could you give me a lift to the Big Air competition?
'Is this the way to the galaxy?'
The new Redbull formula has really gone too far...
Another methane addict - I wouldn’t. They can be quite volatile.
No point in stopping. We're not getting any higher.
Don't, he never chips in for gas.
He looks okay, let’s pull over.
Well, Sully, we know you can do an emergency landing -- how about an emergency pick-up?
I heard he started the Mile High Club.
Apparently Spirit Airlines has introduced a new fare class.
Doesn't he realize he's already there?
Rodger. Prepare to pull over. The '60s just called. They want him back.
Bank and flare the flaps like we’re going to pick him up.
I guess the plane to Woodstock's late.
United flight was overbooked.
Let’s ask if he wants the credit card with free miles.
One of us is definitely too high right now.
As I suspected, Captain, we're over Colorado.
I heard St. Peter turned him away.
Steer clear of that guy. He doesn’t shut up.
Don’t even think about being nice guys or TSA will have our heads...
Well, there's nothing in the regulations about NOT picking up hitchhikers.
You ask him if he's enrolled in TSA Pre-Check.
If we pick up one, we'll have to pick up all of them.
Guess he ditched the Tesla.
He realized too late that the Cloud is a metaphor.
SAD...guess he just got used to travel on the dole. Yeah and that hair...you knew that was FAKE NEWS!
No can do; he probably doesn't have the 25 bucks for the carry-on.
Did you say VFR or VR?
That must be the Cloud Tech guy they just hired.
maybe heaven isn't what it is cracked up to be.
Don't stop; there's something creepy about him.
Sorry buddy, but we're headed for Kennedy.
If he thinks we're going to pick him up with a full flight, he's got his feet in the clouds.
Roger that. All clear for the Hudson.
Wow, they are still dragging people off of flights.
He looks as high as a kite
He obviously rose to the top of the standby list
Check the flight plan, Clarence...I'm pretty sure this is nonstop service.
We are approaching Cloud Cuckoo Land.
All I've been hearing lately is that I need to get with the times and move to the cloud but turns out I'm the only one up here!
Poor guy, I heard the big man is going through a hip-hop phase.
Jeff put hash oil in the simulator again.
I heard the big guy is going through a hip-hop phase.
Lifting his spirits may just give his spirit the optimal lift to cross over.
Next stop, cloud 9. Please mind the gap.
So I see even hitchhiking has moved to the cloud.
Oh no, do you think Trump has exploded the world?
At least someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Do you think we should check with TSA?
I guess Cloud 9 isn't quite what it used to be.
Let's log it as an Unexpected Floating Object.
We must be approaching Colorado.
That is quite a high!
He'll get his lift when the wing gets there.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Globe
I guess the economy is worse than I thought.
Too bad he’s not going our way!
Sir, that is a human drone. It is delivering packages for Amazon.
I think he appreciates our proper use of signals.
Captain, this has been a long strange trip--I'm seeing floaters.
He's probably under fifty pounds.
Didn't we drop that stop?
Is “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” still in print?
Should we stop?" "No he could be dangerous.
That is the weirdest thing I've ever seen God do.
Irv, your dead head needs a ride.
It says cloudy with a chance of Wayne.
Hey bro's. Could you give me a lift to the Jimmy Hendrix concert?
Can't he see we're going the other way?
Not asking for a ride - he just liked us.
Looks like we're going the right way.
Can you give me a lift to Cloud 9?
C'mon, let's give him a lift - we have some to spare.
Hey. Hey. You. You.
C'mon, the next plane isn't coming for 6 hours and we already pulled over.
Apparently, God told him he could condone everything except his desire to audition for The Voice.
Wait 'til I tell the fellas at Trump Tower.
That's what happens when you max-out your cloud download
I'm afraid that, if we don't stop for him, the National Hitchhiker Association is going to sever ties with us.
Don’t stop! He looks like he’s high.
Gary Larson did it 30 years ago in the Farside
The Galaxy is not on our schedule .. just ignore him.
We must be flying through a low pressure zone.
We must have entered Colorado air space.
No, I don't think giving him a lift will set a bad precedent.
Looks like another "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" disciple is lost.
I guess Cloud Nine isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.
Who's he trying to impress?
That carry-on will be an additional $25.
His first mistake was reading “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”
We're fully booked. And besides, the carry-on won't fit in the overhead compartment.
Hey! It's D. B. Cooper!
Acid rain was a term first coined in the sixties
Is this the Stories Behind the Paintings tour for entry-level donors?
Who are you calling genre art?
No, YOU were framed.
Finally, something realistic.
We have no idea what we signify. We came to see the art, not BE the art.
I wouldn't pick him up. He looks pretty high.
Legalize pot and you see what happens?!
Is that Jack Kerouac?
Do you doubt me now that we are heading towards Amsterdam?
I knew the company was keeping its information in the cloud, but this is ridiculous.
Its the newest mileage redemption option from our loyalty program.
He should have stored his ticket on the cloud.
It's not Billy Graham, that's for certain.
He'd be better off waiting for the Southwest behind us - as bags go free there.
United really needs to stop overbooking!
Is Dogs Playing Poker over there?
Should we pull over?
No it's not Ambien Steve, it IS the guy from Skynnerd!
“ Its titled “ Humanity “......... I seen better.
We're making art great again.
I’m no longer certian my head is in it’s full and upright position.
You fellas happen to be going my way?
Pick him up...it's Elvis.
Keep going. He's either a hitchhiker with an oversized carry-on or an air traffic controller on a no-fly list.
I knew legalizing pot was gonna be a problem...
now where do you think he's going joe? considering where his thumbs pointed, id guess space..
I wonder where he wants to go.
It’s by Lewis Carroll.
cloud steerage
I'd give him a lift, but I think he's on something.
Homelessness really has gone way up!
I doubt he has the $25 for that bag--let Southwest pick him up.
Isn't the seat 22B vacant?
Sorry pal, we are not getting any higher
Was the turbulence on A368 really that bad?
Lousy cloud-based ride share
I need a lift to Cloud 9.
This freak has got to be high on something.
We must be over Denver.
If this one too will say he is from flight 370, I am changing the course.
He must have taken a wrong turn at Mt. Everest.
His shoes are going to be all wet.
People should know the risks of booking with a discount airline.
That's a UFO. Unidentified fingered object.
The manuel says to ignore any D.B. Cooper sightings.
Don't pull over! This isn't the 60's!
'We're really taking standby to new heights.'
Elvis has lost weight
Didn't we pass a prison two miles below?
That's the trouble with these runs to St. Cloud, Minnesota.
Tell D.B. Cooper that if he wants a ride home after all this time, he'd better have the money on him.
Another Rolling Stones fan.
He's on the way down and his head is in the clouds.
Last time he was passed a wing was eaten.
Actually, he’s just telling us we’re doing a great job flying.
Wish you were still flying copters?
If he's this high he must want a ride to Burning Man.
Sheesh, next we'll have tin cups!
I saw this guy on the side of the road with a sign that said " Heaven" so I hit him.
Everything is in the cloud these days.
First it's hijackers, now we got hitchhikers.
Not this time. The flight's completely full and there's no more room in cargo.
Sorry Bud, that's too big for a carry-on.
The people look like tramps from up here.
Your immigration status is on hold. Being my brother may no longer be good enough.
Don’t! Our flight’s full!
That's really unsafe.
One of us doesn't belong here.
Do we still have an ‘open seating’ policy for boarding
I wonder if he can play ‘Bus Driver in the Sky’ unplugged.
Are you insane? He could be wearing shoes.
Am I dreaming, or is that D.B. Cooper?
And I thought WE were high.
Pull over. I think I know that guy.
We can't drop another one off in heaven.
We're beginning our descent into Portlandia. The time and weather are about what you'd expect.
I know we are the friendly skys, but do we have to pick up every one?
That's the second heaven reject today!
Don't stop. They always talk for hours.
Some people will do anything to avoid the security screening line-ups.
Can you avoid getting this one in the engine Sully ?
People will do anything to avoid the security lines.
It would definitely improve our ratings in the industry.
Roger that, air control, and please tell the ground crew to de-ass the wing after we land.
This was the inevitable result of cloud computing
Looks like his carry-on may be too big
These drifters never pay bag fees.
No, we can't pick him up there. He's at the wrong terminal. Cloud Nine is two clouds over.
Is he high, or what?
We'll have to throw someone else out, but I'm okay with that.
He took my Galaxy Guide last time I picked him up.
If you look out the left side of your aircraft, you will see Elvis.
Can you please give me a lift? I thought more people would be using the "cloud".
He's got to be High!
He’s got Elon Musk written all over him.
I'd stop but his duffle bag exceeds the airline's carry on size.
He should know the rules: gas, grass, ass, or boarding pass.
He must live nearby; he's always on that same cloud!
Yep, Cloud Nine- obviously a million miles from reality, but ev'ry man in this world is free. So we comp his flight or get sued.
It makes me wonder if that's not Led Zeppelin run out of stairway?
He died with unredeemed miles.
That’s me ten years ago.
Another Kerouac wannabe.
Aren't trips to heaven one-way?
I guess that guy didn't have enough frequent flyer miles?
Don't fall for it! Haven't you been briefed on the 'Cumulonimbus Slasher' serial killer?
Now I can really tell you what I think of the family.
Don't stop, we have no idea where that thumb has been.
Oh, yeah? Well, you ain't exactly a prime example of tonality, coloration and varied brushwork yourself, buddy!
How are we going slow enough to see him?
His carry-on bag is too large to fit in the overhead compartment.
Don't pick him up. I think he's high.
I hate it when they route us near Cloud 9.
It's been since the '60's that anyone was high enough to hitchhike commercial.
I'm always nervous about picking up a guy with a harp.
"I quit picking up hitchhikers when they legalized pot".
Don't let him on. That was the kid from the last flight who was so bratty he was told to go outside and play.
They call it boomer-fusion-retro-cloud...it started our West...
I hear he got left there by United.
Hey dude, can I get a lift to Denver?
Yo!
Guess no one told him we don"t fly standby anymore.
Too obvious, I won't win the caption contest by referring to D. B. Cooper.
He should know the carry-on won't fit in the overhead.
He must have read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe
When I took my gap year I just worked at the local corner store
It must be a metaphor for 'slipping the surly bonds'.
At this altitude we get a lot of them.
I know we are testing the Uber model, but does our new ride-sharing fare policy apply to this one?
If you stop, there's always three more waiting behind the cloud.
I bet he has a lot of sky miles.
I see Trump Airlines has a new way to bump passengers who are Democrats.
We are not picking up any more galaxy hitchhikers
I’d stop but his bag is longer than 24”.
I didn't know that David Crosby had died.
He was upgraded from standby to floatby.
"He's going to South by Southwest, but not by Delta.
Sorry buddy we are going to Havana, Cuba, not heaven
Do we have 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Stratosphere?'
Drifter...
I thought "The Hitch-hiker's Guide To The Galaxy" was fiction.
Well, that settles it, time to replace the altimeter again....
maybe he'll blow us
Do you think we should call it in?
I guess Cloud 9 isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I would stop, but he has a carry-on and we are out of overhead storage space.
The stairway to heaven must be under repair.
Clearly, It's better to burn out than fade away?
Company policy is don't report a UFO or a hitch-hiker.
Oh shit, there's that hobo I killed in 1973.
Don't pick him up - we already passed cloud eight.
No hitchhikers means no hitchhikers even with holy jeans!
Hey, is that the guy who was in the unfortunate runway accident?... naaaaa...
Don't panic, it's just another tripper on cloud nine.
I think we should check our horoscopes first.
If the wing doesn't get him, I say we pick him up on the way back.
Don't forget the baggage fee.
The flight attendants hate repeating the safety instructions.
Let’s give the poor guy a ride, then charge three hundred bucks for the carry-on.
Attention passengers, to our left you can now see the patron saint of overbooking.
Just don't make eye contact.
I wouldn't stop, we just passed a prison.
Looks like an oversized carry-on bag, keep going.
4D is open, but it's Economy Plus. Think he has status?
Think he knows it's a fifty buck fee for cloud pickup?
Those tickets to Cloud 8 are real cheap, but people don't think ahead about that final leg.
Just wave; he thinks this is a truck.
Okay, we'll bring him on board. But, we have to charge him for the carry-on.
Nine miles high, no TSA line.
Wonder what he is high on. Must be some very good stuff.
People will do anything to avoid those TSA patdowns.
Looks like he's stratus'd
That big bag would need to be checked. I say we keep flying.
I think he's telling us all of our flight data is backed up and safe.
Don't stop. He looks high.
Obviously it's an attempt to bypass security.
Clouds are breaking and we are heading to landing in San Francisco
That's not what I meant by 'lift.'
We can, but he's going to have to check that bag.
Don't stop. He looks high.
I bet that guy has a guide to the galaxy.
What kind of brakes does he think we have?
Keep going. If he can afford the cloud, he can afford the fare.
Don’t stop! He’s got an oversized carry on!
You're right, he's not giving us the finger.
Talk about "high".
Passengers on our left may enjoy the view of purgatory.
I missed the 4:15 flight.
He's been up here since 1969, blames the brown acid.
What some people will try to avoid arport security.
Do you suppose Uber is using Cloud technology?
My records show he has Global Entry - let him in.
If he's homeless: no; if he's hipster: OK.
His thumb should be pointed out.
Hey, Bob should we stop and pick him up? Na, he looks kinda sketchy, better just ignore him.
I need a ride from hell to earth please!
Take me to heaven!
I’ll put it this way...if we DON'T pick him up, then Mr. Shatner in 23A is about to get quite a surprise.
Is that William Shatner?
This is a direct flight
Should we pick him up?" "Nah, it's just another hippie falling from Cloud 9!
Teacher: Can you show me your homework studensts? Students: Sure! Of curse, teacher!!
We'd better check that altimeter again.
I take it, THIS is our ‘deadhead’?
We are not stopping, that duffle bag is clearly not carry-on size.
Think we should we pull over?
The latest cloud update I assume.
Airplane tickets take you everywhere these days.
Looks like the Flying Tomato took too much height on the half-pipe again.
I know him. Once on board he always wants an upgrade.
Are we high?
My mother said to never pickup strangers
They are getting really exact when it comes to Air Miles.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy needs to be upgraded.
Oh No, another Cabinet member wants to fly free!
Do you think he's on his way to Cloud 9 or returning from it?
What does he think we are? An air bus?
You would think Heaven would have a more robust transportation system.
Are you flying past Cloud 8?
I think he is high.
Jesus Christ?!
I think he was in the rock group, Vanity Fare.
Don't make eye contact, that guys clearly high!
Oh, him? He's been up here ever since Jerry Garcia died.
Wow, times have hit hard since the halo and cream cheese days.
Fine, but he's still got to pay for a bottle of water
I wouldn't mind stopping for him, but his carry-on is just way too big.
Keep going!
No way. Looks like a farter.
Go back around, he must have some really good drugs.
We might be a tad low, Bill.
He must be coming from the Led Zeppelin concert.
Finding cheap ways to travel
Now there's a guy who doesn't feel the same kind of pressure we do.
Our job has certainly gotten harder now that so many states have legalized marijuana.
Some people will do anything to avoid TSA.
How high ARE we?
Hey You! Get off of my cloud!
That makes THREE I've seen since California legalized pot!!
Okay, but he sits in Coach.
Think we should stop?
Does he really want to go back?
Just pretend these hitchhikers are telling us that we are doing a great job flying.
Oh, fine, we can take him, but he has to be out by Atlanta.
Ignore him. He offers to pay for jet fuel but he never does.
These venture capitalists are too much. They get to the gate late, miss the flight, and still think they can board if they meet us midway.
I guess Google was right. Everything is saved to the cloud now.
Don't be alarmed, just another unidentified floating vagrant.
I don't know, there's something off about him.
Folks, if you look out the left side of the plane you'll get the rare chance to see someone who managed to book the $29 fare sale on JetBlue.
That guy on Cloud Eight doesn’t look too happy.
Another millennial looking for a free ride!
He looks like a guy I saw at a Dead show.
What are you looking at?
I'll give him credit for having his backpack in the upright position.
Looks like he's leaving Cloud 9.
Co-pilot: "Look Phil, a sky diver! Should we stop and pick him up?" Pilot: "No, John, keep flying."
Cloud 9?
It's rough even in heaven.
Man, we're a lot higher than I thought.
I can let you have some gas, but I'm a little short myself.
Sir, I think we're way too high.
Angle or not, I still think this is risky.
Better pass him by. He looks really high to me.
When hitchhikers are this high, I don't even slow down for them.
can you radio Kanye West for instructions ?
Oh, so that's why it's called Spirit Airlines.
"A man'll do anything to have some alone time."???
I thought that Douglas Adams wrote fiction.
If he's still there, we'll pick him up on the way back.
Never call a flight attendant stewardess!
No shoes. He must've been screened already.
just ignore him,we're full
Don't trust him. His cloud service got hacked last week.
Captain are you sure that was a virgin margarita?
Let's pick him up. He might have some pot to share.
Should we download some more live music from the cloud?
Listen, son. There's no such thing as free peanuts.
I met that guy a while ago. He's a real air head.
Of COURSE I read The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy...
Let's pick him up; he deserves a free ride.
I think he's telling us we're doing a good job.
Same guy we dropped off over Nebraska.
I don't know Captain, If we pick him up, we'll have to bump another passenger!
You can store anything in the iCloud these days!
Damn... am I high, or is he?
I had the chicken salad, why do you ask...
Looks like cloud nine lost its luster.
It’s easier than going through TSA.
Well you gotta give them credit for thinking above the norm...
That's what he gets for trying to carry on his guitar, instead of trusting us to handle it.
Somebody needs to tell this guy that Woodstock is over.
I thought Howard Hughes passed away.
Keep flying. Space X will give him a lift.
Sorry, it's ass, grass, or cash. No one rides for free.
I'm not doing him - we've picked up three already
What looks suspicious about him to you?
This happens every time ticket fares go up.
Hey bros. Could you give me a lift to the nearest highway to Heaven.
Fine, but you have to open the door this time
Must be a new icloud service.
Look, Harry, another perpendicular hitchhiker.
Don’t stop. He’s high as a kite.
He wants to go back?!
You’d think the would have told him earlier his flight was oversold .
I'm cool, I've been through heaven's security
He has long hair and shabby clothes, and that's what makes you uneasy about him?
I say no. He looks like he might have some kind of weird comfort animal.
No way - that carry-on would never fit in the overhead bin.
Let's not stop. He's probably no angel.
Another feather-headed lightweight with no respect for boundaries.
Keep going - he looks really high.
The homeless have evolved.
We're only going as far as St. Cloud.
Sorry, Bob, no TSA onboard.
Geez, I thought we landed first before kicking an obnoxious passenger off the plane.
I had no idea that’s what they meant by “cloud economy” class!
Think he’ll ever find the cloud with his computer info?
Keep going. This Air Force One doesn't pick up hitchhikers!
Everyone's moving to the cloud these days.
You ought to see this guy, he's out there without a hat.
I've been counting and ironically, that makes 42 !
We shouldn't stop, it's a bumpy neighborhood.
Are you sure? He seems high.
"Nice to see that Woodstock is alive & well!
That's your lowest form of angel - no wings and forced to hitchhike.
I'd say we should stop, but I doubt his bag's been checked.
Do FAA regulations say anything about cloud-based hitchhikers?
Didn't we just see this guy on the Atlanta leg?
It's nice to see that Uber hasn't penetrated the cloud market yet.
I guess Heaven's feeling the recession too.
Those new standing room only drones are a serious distraction.
The weatherman did forecast dense clouds.
Look Marty! The new, live biofeedback weathervane!
Did you know it was one year ago to the day when United ejected some guy from a plane in mid-flight for having too much carry-on?
Look, it's Timothy Leary and he's okay! He's just outside looking in.
A new level of flying, one step below standby.
It's okay, the wing will get him.
Ass, grass or gas....no one flies for free.
Immigrants reached here too?
Seems like everything is on the Cloud these days
Coming down off cloud nine is never easy
Didn't we just pass him a few clouds ago?
Oh, to be young, carefree and high again...
It's best if you don't make eye contact.
Poor guy. He made it to the Pearly Gates. But the wrong Gate!
Moral of the story: never board a United Airlines flight with too much carry-on.
It must be spring break at Hey U.
What would Sully do?
Jog a little left, we can suck him right in.
I thought that guy was an angel at first!
Oh, Shit! (Note: these are the most common last words recorded on the cockpit voice recorder in fatal aircraft accidents.)
They weren't specific enough when they said the hitchhiker problem was rising
Which airline do you think dropped him off?
If he got this far, he can get himself the rest of the way.
Now, that's odd. You don't see many hitchhikers anymore.
Let's stop -- he seems like a first-class guy.
Things people do to avoid the TSA line...
Never trust a hitch-hiker on a strange cloud.
He can't afford a plan ticket, but those ripped jeans are definitely designer
Ignore him! He's obviously high.
Pretty soon you boys will be out of business.
Didn't we recently see this in a 'New Yorker' magazine cartoon?
Is he hitchhiking or recommending the mashed potatoes?
I'm not convinced he actually needs a lift.
Sure he exists on a 'higher plane'. But it's our plane, and he never kicks in for fuel.
That's one way to beat the long lines at TSA...
He looks high.
He refuses to take the stairway to heaven.
I guess the Tesla moon landing effort had some problems!
I told you flying over Parkland was a bad idea!
Let him take an Uber
Careful Sully, he looks pretty sullied.
I don't know, does he look "ethnic" to you?
Another dead hippie-freak wants a free ride.
If we give him a lift he’ll be on cloud nine.
Is that DB Cooper?
I never stop. They all play the same Rolling Stones song.
I really have to stop watching old Twilight Zone episodes before each flight.
Another drifter? Airlock the doors.
Isn’t that the guy we booted off on the way over?
Maybe we are too low?
You see it too? Yeah I told you that damn airline fish would do us in one day.
I guess Starman got bored out there in space.
We can close our eyes to the plight of the skies. Dave, you noticing all this plight?
Wow, another gold-plated parachute CEO! He must have harrassed a lot of women to be this far from earth.
I would, but he might be a hijacker.
Isn't that Doug Adams?
Godzooks!
Looks like another state legalized marijuana.
Don’t panic.
Last time we picked up a hitchhiker she was a real angel
I felt bad putting him out, but he didn't pay the extra fee to go the whole way.
I thought hitchhiking was against the law.
Hey, Mark! Remember me?
Some people never know when to quit.
We should at least offer him some peanuts.
Captain, is he cirrus?
We can take him, but he'll have to check his bag.
Keep going ... That backpack looks bigger than the allowable carry-on size and I’ll bet he doesn’t have the $25 bucks on him.
Sorry this is a non-stop.
How I long for the 60's... these guys never stop!
Roger, we are over Denver.
Rocketmen think they're Soooo Funny.
Another one on his way down from Cloud 9.
The dude is clearly higher than a kite if he thinks we're gonna give him a ride!
Well, then, he shouldn’t have sent his car into orbit.
Better not risk it. He looks high to me.
We must be flying over San Francisco.
There's that guy again. He's always high.
Remind me to read 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy'.
I can never tell if Andy Kaufman is joking or being serious.
The nerve of that guy; he knows we were overbooked!
Don't stop for him. Next thing you know, he'll want food service too.
I'd stop, but quite frankly, we'd plummet to our deaths.
He's high if he thinks we're going to stop to pick him up.
I think he likes our in-flight movie.
Things have changed a lot since Uber bought the airline
Are you guys going Southwest?
He’s already in heaven, so he probably won’t kill us.
It's Arthur Dent!!
Yes Ron, I know these are the friendly skies, but NO...we’re not stopping!
What say we show Elon Musk who really controls the airspace?
I told him it was just a Rolling Stones song.
God must be his copilot.
He is definitely not on cloud 9.
Wow! I have NEVER seen anyone that needed a manicure more than that guy.
I think I ate some bad peanuts...
How's it going on cloud 9?
Next time I'll have a Virgin Mary with dinner!
Oh look, a drifter.
It's an Unidentified Freeloading Object.
Heavens! Another hitch hiker to avoid. What's next?!" "Cloud climbers...?
It may not look like a mushroom cloud, but it sure smells like one.
Struggling harpists! Why don't they get that we can't divert from our flight plan?
Will navigate for food.
Naw, he's only on Cloud Eight.
Times are pretty turbulent.
Head in the clouds, these guys are all the same.
I didn't think Dead & Company were on tour right now.
We're just a little too close to that mountain top
I know we're not supposed to pick them up, but can we put them down?
Guess he is tired of Cloud 9.
Are you sure we didn't drink the mushroom tea from Peru?
It's going to be a rude awakening when he comes down from whatever he's on.
That carry-on isn't going to fit in the overhead.
Probably couldn't afford the excess baggage fees.
So that's what happened to DB Cooper!
Wonder how far he's going?
Talk about a no frills airline!
Why bother? That wing is about to make him half the man he is now.
The altimeter is showing 35,000 feet but I think we're higher than that.
He asked Delta for an upgrade after the Olympics.
I think he's looking for a ride.
He's doomed. It's only partly cloudy.
Aha, an Elon Projection
What - when did Neil Young die? I thought he was just burned out.
It must suck when your frequent flyer miles only get you half way.
I knew these drones were going to be a problem.
Add some hair and I swear that’s D.B. Cooper.
We can't stop for just anyone.
Sure, those jetpacks sound like a great idea till you run out of fuel.
I think we just found D.B. Cooper.
Last time we stopped for someone it didn't work out well.
He must be as high as a kite.
We're not stopping. My first three wives all left me for Nick Cave.
Didn't we just pass him on Cloud Eight?
I think we'd better pick him up. This might be a test.
Don't pick him up! He's high!
I never get used to these Deadhead flights.
Hey You! Get off of my cloud!
When we land don't mention him, we'll get fired for being alcoholics.
Sully, are you sure we got everyone off?
I’m not sure about this one.
they just appear from nowhere. I wonder where they are going
No way that bag is fitting in the overhead compartment.
Truckin'...like the do-dah man, keep truckin'...
Did the dinner have mushrooms tonight?
Do you think we should pull over?
So,the GPS says turn left at the pedestrian on the cloud. Wow, this last update is specific.
Going my way?
Do you think his affiliation is right wing or left wing?
And for the first time since flight school, Ralph and Benny would have to make a split second decision.
Didn't we see him when we left Denver?
To be worthy of a ride, he'd have his own jet.
No halo. Looks like he missed out.
There’s no way that will fit in the overheads.
Bumping passengers en route to preserve on-time performance? Genius!
I know we're high but are you seeing what i'm seeing
Maybe he can give us a break, take a turn flying this thing.
Another airhead on Cloud Nine.
OMG, who hitchhikes anymore?
We were told not to pick up any hitchhikers.
No, that's God. He only thinks he's Bono.
Another dreamer trying to get back to the U.S..
We're over Colorado.
Nope - his carry-on is too big
He’s high.
D.B. Cooper? Who the heck is D.B. Cooper?
-I87
D.B. Cooper? No, sir, can't say I'm familiar with that individual.
I just don't get the holey jeans, thing.
He'd have to check the bag, though.
That Elon Musk is quite a character.
Another feeble attempt without a reservation.
Forgot my iCloud password...
He's on cloud 8 - so close.
Did you also have of that orange juice they serve in first class?
"TSA regs don't allow hitchhikers Alvin".
Damn it Paul, this is what happens when you start giving free rides.
Look, he likes our plane!
Another thumbs up from him? Better check the wings and engines...
Before the TSA I used to pick them all up.
Another young kid with his head in the clouds.
Where's TSA when you need 'em?
I think we can stop to pick him up, he only has one carry on.
We could stop to ask directions.
Okay, we'll pick him up. But you have to land this thing!
How the hell do I know - I guess I just pushed the wrong key on my computer.
So that's where California sends them.
Don't even think about it captain - that head wind over Denver already put us 45 minutes behind.
Oh ... him again.
The new organic ethanol fuel is a big hit with the spiritual environmentalists!
Don't stop, no carry-ons allowed in basic economy
Doesn't that fool know we can't pick up hikers anymore?
To think I chose to be a pilot to get rid of hitchhikers!
Is that Starman from the SpaceX roadster?
I've seen a big uptick in hitchhighkers since legalization.
Ground Control--This is Flight #42. We have a visual on the Hitchhiker. He is clouding around.
All his bags are packed. He’s ready to go.
Just ignore him; I'm done doing favors for relatives.
Not even if this was a helicopter.
We can't pick him up. Look at the size of that carry-on.
What should we charge for a partial flight?
Another 'Lifted Up' half way, then 'Left Behind!'
Should I notify Air Traffic Control of....um....an 'Unidentified Hitchhiking Object'??
Another one stuck on cloud nine, Jim.
Trump can't build a wall this high
If we weren't 20 minutes behind schedule I'd pick him up.
This is not a good area, shake the wings.
He 's been there since he got fired on the spot by Space X.
Why don't we let Elon handle this one?
William Shattner dropped me off here.
Be careful. He'll just go on and on about the virtues of the cloud.
Is this the sequel or prequel to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
Isn't he the guy we bumped?
Don’t make eye contact. If we stop for him, next week there’ll be one on every cloud.
I guess they double checked his frequent flyer points
Isn't he the one who exited during the flight to Seattle?
Should we pick him up, he looks harmless, but he is high?
Am I crazy or is that Bob Dylan playing a harmonica?
It's a shame what happens when you waste your life getting high.
Where's his chair and balloons?
No, no. Don't pick up him. Hitchhikers are dangerous, they're the ones that He kicked out.
Don't even think of making another unplanned stop, Sully!
Last time I picked up a hitchhiker up here, he held a gun to my head so no more!
Guess he’s tired of walking on Cloud 9?
Another Tesla driver who believed the hype.
I"ll radio ahead to Uber to send out one of their flying cabs.
Do you think purgatory is akin to one of our service classes?
Don't stop ... he looks high on something!
I always thought 'he's on cloud nine' was just an expression.
Are we over Colorado already?
In about two seconds he's going to get three wings
Isn't that a member of The Byrds?
When I saw him it was too late to stop.
So that's what happened to DB Cooper!
If the Tesla didn't pick him up, we're certainly not going to.
I think he's higher then we are.
No halo, no service!
Some people will try anything to avoid those excess baggage fees.
He was mistaken about living on cloud 9
He's obviously high.
Where does he want to go? He's already on Cloud 9.
He's obviously high on something.
hey, pull over!
His favorite song is 8 Miles High
I feel Rod's presence?
Concentrate. It’s just a caption in search of a Captain.
Dude’s really high. We over Mendocino?
Must be an infrequent flyer.
Margaritaville to Mars?
Don't they know there is no more room on cloud nine?
I want to go home again. This next life is not for me.
There is that crazy guy again! Just because we stopped for him once...
This is what happens when you start making pot legal.
Like we're falling for that... not until you pay a baggage fee, fella!
They're putting everything in the cloud these days.
Pull over Sal. He ain’t got time for a fast train, his baby wrote him a letter...
I wouldn't. He looks pretty stoned.
"United passenger".
They really should've left the bar lowest at economy class.
These deadheads will follow Jerry anywhere.
Don't pick him up. I think he's high.
Captain Sully, are we having a hippie flashback from 1967?
That's my father. Keep going. Fuck that prick.
How does he do that?
If you doesn’t mind Captain we can put him in a jump seat.
It’s amazing what is stored in the CLOUD these days.
Ask one of the Flight Attendants to toss out a package of pretzels.
Like the new medical marijuana laws are outa sight maaan!
What will they put on the cloud next?
It's just not safe to pick them up any more.
Yes, captain, I'll be glad to take control, and, no, I don't see your long lost vagabond self on that cloud.
Death is not kind to the hippy generation.
Gee, there really is a Stairway to Heaven.
Let's wing it and pick him up. He seems to traveling light, no carry on bags.
Oh, him. He's afraid of flying. Says he's waiting for a bus.
Maybe he'll suck our dicks if we pick him up.
People are definitely packing lighter these days.
He'll be fine, he can just take an Uber
Looks like the FAA's Sully poster child... .
Man, some people will do anything for free peanuts.
‘Thumbs up to the new iCloud hitchhiking app!’
If he's going to this galaxy, he needs a better guide book.
Hey fella. the word is "Geronimo!"
Some people will do anything for a free ride.
I didn't know a jetpack could get you this far.
Last week, he was holding a "Will work for seat in first class" sign.
Hey, there's our guide to the universe.
Don't acknowledge him -- he's probably a Vogon in disguise.
When it starts raining backpackers someone will say its climate change.
Looks familiar.
I never pick-up hitchhikers.
Don't stop. He's obviously high on something.
“They never did find D.B.Cooper.”-
Ordinarily I'd say, 'sure, let's give him a ride'... Gut I don't think he and his bag went through TSA / x-ray check. He's gonna need to wait for another plane.
I don't know how he expects us to stop to pick him up.
Hey Scully. Fly your way out of this one!
Don’t stop. Something about him doesn’t look right.
Are we suppose to pick up passengers on 'Cloud Nine'
The pack won't fit in an overhead bin.
There he is again, back up on the cloud.
Backpacking across Europe so last year.
I lowered the flaps, but I forgot to sync the cloud drive. Sorry pal, next flight is in 45 minutes.
What a dolt! 'Stand on the shoulder, you putz!'
Looks like the Monkey King ran out of gas again.
Guess he had enough of Starman on infinite loop.
Yeah we might see them anywhere along here, from Cloud 1 to Cloud 8.
Sorry, no seats left on this flight, try the next one.
I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.
That's Cloud 9.
He’s headed up, up, and away. We’re just headed west.
Our airlines is getting more creative with its "fly standby" promotion...
I need to take that 'zero tolerance' for recreational drugs use policy more seriously!
Must be the new stand-by restrictions.
Keep going. He could be drunk or on drugs.
Last time we stopped for him, we ended up landing on the Hudson.
Don't pick up hitchhikers, especially the high ones.
Don’t stop! He looks like he’s high.
Yasgur’s farm? Does that mean anything to you?
To Hell with him.
So they put the last director of the FAA out to cloud?
Sorry, but we no longer service Cloud 9.
I’d like to get off of my cloud
NRA supporter. Need I say more.
Not with a carry-on that won't fit under the seat.
We might be cruising at 45,000 feet. But that dude is high as hell.
Heaven forbid! Is he trying to tell us something?
The "Hitchhikers Guide" recommended this cloud.
Another one confusing us with no frills airlines. Ignore him.
...and then I said, 'Are you serious? The USA totally dominated the blue line this year.'
They're getting really tough with stowaways.
Another freeloading drifter.
Twilight Zone Dejavu
He usually heads south in the winter.
I’m sick of these guys with their feet in the clouds trying to wing it.
He's, like, on the wrong side of the street. Amateur.
Is this California or Colorado?
Yeah, I picked him up once. Guy has his head in the clouds.
Should we tell him he's a little late for Woodstock?
Yes, we're promulgating the stereotype of white men as airline pilots. But that's a hitchhiker standing on a freaking cloud.
Is there still a reward for finding D.B. Cooper?
Hollywood and bust! No, no I mean "or"!
Ever since we stopped our NRA miles program, he stopped giving use the middle finger.
He doesn’t need a lift. He’s on Cloud 9
Of course we should pick him up! He's only on Cloud #8.
I'd pick him up but I prefer the Johnny Cash version of Ghost Riders in the Sky
Cloud 8 is as close as you're gonna get, hippie freak.
Look, another guy trying to use miles.
I've got a funny feeling about that flashing red light earlier.
Sure it's cheap, but it takes all the joy out of flying.
Too bad his baggage exceeds regulation carry-on size.
Just ignore him. He can buy a ticket like everyone else!
Hitchhikers these days Captain.
Gas, grass, or ass; nobody rides for free.
That’s a no can do. There’s a full ground stop in Tacoma. How’s Helena?
Wow! I never took that book seriously.
Make a note to check the altimeter.
"Twilight Zone" re-boot?
If he got this far up why is he still looking for a ride?
I don't know, he looks pretty sketchy to me.
United’s new layover policy is truly groundbreaking.
Once a hippy always a hippy.
Maybe it's D.B. Cooper?
Don't worry about it, our wing will take him out.
he sure chose a bad spot. there is no place to pull over
He looks high.
No, keep flying! We're overbooked as usual.
hi i'm db cooper, can i get a ride?
Cap...three o'clock...apparently the only way down from Cloud Nine is to hitch a ride.
They really cut the NASA budget to the bone.
Sorry buddy, this is the express.
And they say heaven can wait
Looks like Uber's charging surge prices again.
Let's not, he looks high.
Why did the space shuttle drop him off here ?
Cumulus! - ahem - sorry, something in my throat, I meant: "come with us!"
Don't pick him up we're flying over a prison.
The weather radar does say dense fog.
Geez. We're really running out of places for the homeless to crash.
I thought we already passed cloud 9.
Don't pick him up! He was thrown off his flight for excessive gas.
ICE said not to pick up anyone from cloud #9
Highest snowflake I've seen yet.
But, Captain, he hasn't been screened.
I guess that’s it. No more room on earth for the homeless.
LSD is not high enough for him?
I thought “A Hitchhiker’s Guide To the Galaxy,” was just science fiction!
I never would have thought that's what He actually looks like.
I don't know, Frank - this guy looks pretty high . . .
Don’t feel bad Cap. We’ll pick him up on the way back.
But only if it’s economy plus.
No Son, I'm pretty sure he's not looking for a ride.
We are entering a dead zone.
Sorry Sully, he might be a terrorist.
Some people will do anything to avoid security!
Don’t slow down, Steve. He’s clearly high...
Don’t make eye contact, its awkward.
I thought we left him in Denver.
He's cloud commuting.
Since when have we been storing standby passengers in the cloud?
If we pick him up, someone's going to fail their sobriety test and be grounded.
Trump really did drain the swamp!
Well, I don't understand how we stay in the air either.
Didn't we leave that guy on Cloud Nine?
I only see hitchhikers over states that have legalized marijuana.
Call Tesla to send another car....
Don't look. Just keep going.
Can I get a lift to the nearest AirBNB?
And that's how I became the President's personal pilot.
Uber doesn't take this route.
Must have been working on the cloud and missed the Google bus back to San Francisco. Happens all the time.
Is Tom Hanks making another movie?
Uh-oh. Did you have the puffer fish for dinner too?
Guess he didn't quite make it.
Don't look. He just wants the peanuts.
Forget it. Flying's dangerous enough.
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud! (apologies to the Stones)
Man, some guys will do anything to avoid the TSA line.
If you make eye contact he'll want to clean our windshield.
Captain, there is the first sign that ticket prices are rising
I’ve got a feeling we’re about to experience a hard landing.
Look over there. The old plane never got a thumbs up from anyone!
Make it from scratch, Dude.
This Global Entry thing is really getting out of control.
Let's let the Tesla pick him up!
Don't stop. He looks like he's higher than a kite.
No, not since I saw Texas Turbine Massacre...
Don't pick him up.He looks like hes high.
So dangerous.
Do they have Uber up here?
Meditating in Tibet can sure get you in a lot of trouble.
Sully, do we really have to pick him up to extend your fifteen minutes of fame?
Ask one of the Flight Attendants to toss him a bag of pretzels.
How does he think we're going to stop? Frankenstein needs to do a better job on the AI
Jim Morrison needs a lift.
Looks like he scored some really good weed.
Looks like Amazon has your tube socks...
Houston, we'd like to confirm another Elvis sighting.
That guy is crazy - no way tbat’ll fit in carryon.
Sorry, those jeans do nothing for me.
You get what you pay for with hacker fares
Maybe St. Peter didn’t like the fashion statement.
Ignore him- He's out of this world!
Wow, St. Peter is really on the skids since he lost that Pearly Gates gig.
Ever since marijuana was legalized, there have been SO many high kids looking for an easy ride
The new robots certainly have amazing qualities!
You always know when your over Oregon.
Ha, we found Luke Skywalker.
Burning Man must be over.
Those low-budget airlines really know how to cut corners.
I don’t think we have any overhead room left for his bag.
I think he'd have more luck on the runway
I know this is odd but I actually paid for business.
I AM GOING TO HAVEN.
Pay no mind - just another escapee from Area 51.
It's D.B. Cooper!
I've gotta stop smoking those funny cigarettes.
I think we found D.B. Cooper!
"What do you think?
IMAGINE, HOMELESS EVEN UP HERE-----
Be careful, he may be an escapee!
I guess he got tired of the weather.
I read his guide. I say we give him a bypass.
Don't pick him up, he looks weird.
Captain, I just saw something very strange. I think it was Allen Ginsburg standing on a cloud.
This is neither the time nor the place.
Sully, his sign says, "Hudson River or Bust."
Did they ever find that D. B. Cooper guy?
Ok, but only if he has gas money and can fly the plane while I take a nap.
United must have started mid-flight bump offs.
I think he is waiting for an Air B&B.
Keep flying. Last time I picked him up he picked a fight with Alec Baldwin.
Are they doing "Angels in the Clouds" now?
Wish I could stop.
Look, it’s the author of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Universe”!
Ya know, I still feel a little guilty when we don't pick them up...
I bet he's going to Colorado.
This takes 'bum a ride' to a new level, literally.
This must be the Tesla dummy dropping from outer space, pay it no mind.
The forecast did say, "Cloudy, with a chance of hitchhikers."
He got sucked into one of our engines last week.
Then he says, “if you can’t stand the heat get out of my...” hey you see that?
I must say, his optimism is pretty far out.
Born again hitch hiker
I think we found D.B. Cooper!
Don't pull over... Pull up!
"If he can fly this thing, that would be a break.
Dude's in rock 'n roll heaven.
Mr Lee, are we in one of your Iron Man cameos?
Fuel, jewels, or Moscow mules.
This iCloud thing has gotten out of control.
Don't even think about it, Sully.
I missed the bus!
It was legal in his day.
(Captain)It's really getting bad. (Co Captain) And they know we can't stop!!
OK, but he'll have to pay for that carry-on
Never knew Jesus was a hitch hicker
I think he's that angel who hasn't earned his wings yet.
Those hippies are on the up and up
That Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy must not be fake news after all !
Lyft has a new business model
The Sixties are so over for me.
He's from Denver..
What you can't see won't avert you.
Keep going. We can't charge him for a checked bag.
Damn! Where's the tesla ?
I think that's D.B. Cooper.
Bubble over older pilots head...“Why don’t people dress up to travel anymore?”
Don't stop, he's phishing.
I know it's -supposed- to be basic economy but how can we tell them apart from deranged killers? Keep flying.
You say hitchhiker, and I say high jacker let’s call the whole thing off.
The Rolling Stones right? "...Hey! You! Get off of my cloud..."
Guess they closed the stairway to heaven.
Not with that oversized carry on.
I told him, “get off my cloud.”
Don’t stop. I bet he’s high.
It's against policy to pick up anyone on cloud nine.
You see a lot of them now since they started deporting them too.
Sorry, this is as high as we’re going!
You mean you just fly by?
Boy, talking about having your head in the clouds.
Say, doesn't that look like Allen Ginsberg?
I swear he looks like Billy Graham!
I think he's in the wrong galaxy
I heard they started filming the 2018 version of "Twilight Zone"
Yesterday he was on cloud 9.
Jan and I cleaned out the attic last weekend. We're storing all the crazy relatives in the cloud now.
Let's ignore him. He most likely uploaded a whole commune to the iCloud!
How did he get past security?
Isn't that the guy Elon Musk put into orbit in a Tesla Roadster?
Wow! That’s the new flotation device!
Could be Elon Musk's driver.
Jesus Christ! Who does he think he's think he's fooling with the guitar?
I read "Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Universe," and he really should be a lot more further by now.
Hey,hey,you, get me off of this cloud -
Ever since they legalized pot.
Are you saying you'd rather have god as your copilot?
It’s probably not a good idea to pick up strangers.
Don't pull over. That guy never chips in for gas.
We could drop him at the rest stop on Cloud Nine
He must have just read "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
I have a strict policy to not pickup hitchhikers on their way to heaven.
People are getting too high these days.
I don’t think it’s a “thumbs up.”
I think I know that guy! You'd think he would have dressed for the cold. We'll pick him up on the way back, if he's still there.
What do you think? Should we pick him up?
I heard , back in your day, you actually would pick them up.
That's only cloud three.
Look, it's the man from the moon
I'm sure the next SpaceX rocket will pick him up
I hope this isn't another Twilight Zone episode.
- Fly faster, honey. He could be a terrorist.
He has his wings!
Everybody wants an upgrade.
He doesn't need another lift.
I know the airline hates when we fly with empty seats. But this is getting ridiculous!
Whoa, that dude looks high!
No Too manning care-ons
Damn hitchhikers. You'd think they 'd have a little pride.
Sometimes the final background check, makes them lose their wings.
I've heard of being "high as a kite", but this is the first time I've seen it!
OK OK But we can't pick up ever angel novice and fly them to earth to earn wings. It's too disconcerting to the passengers.
Uhhh Jerry, before we let him on the plane lets review the admission criteria for heaven. He’s looking a little sketchy.
Poor guy. Guess he didn’t get the gate change notifications.
Like Sergeant Schultz says, "I see nothing"...
'" That pothead is always on Cloud 9"
I don't pick-up hitchhikers. How can you stand on a cloud? I still won't give you a ride but your cloud standing thing is pretty cool.
Elvis?
Sorry, overbooked!
So that’s where D.B. Cooper has been all this time!
He must fly United.
Well, it is cheaper than stand-by.
Jeez Sully, you’re pressing your luck by picking up strangers.
I'd like to hitch a ride .
I don't think it would be very fair to the people who paid.
Hey! Looks like that dude is finally getting off my cloud.
On his way to the galaxy
Where's security?
Sorry, this is direct
Elvis - always trying to get back to Vegas!
From Cloud Nine to living on a wing and a prayer. What happened?
Sorry, we're fully booked.
Elon Musk's brand is everywhere.
Don’t be fooled, Sully, he used to be Lead singer for “Flock of Seagulls”.
He could probably teach us a thing or two about lift.
Speed up. That's Charles Manson!
He must have lost his guide to the galaxy.
Stand by passengers are really getting desperate lately.
I sure hope he’s got the guide with him.....
Don't make eye contact. Just another long-haired hippie.
is this what they mean “ the cloud will change the industry”?
Does'nt he know he needs a ticket to ride?
Maybe we should pick him up. What if it's Jesus and he was kicked out of Heaven and needs a lift?
All your stuff is stored here in the cloud.
We're up so high, I think we hit Heaven!
Guess he lost his "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
Well, this is California airspace.
I remember the days when hitchhikers, just felt they were on a cloud..
Check the altimeter: I just saw an angel of my better nature.
$35 for a bag? I’ll take the next flight.
I Don’t think we survived the landing
But if we stop for him, we won't have time to finish our chemtrails.
He's already on Cloud Nine; how much better does he think it gets?
Too high for a drone, I wonder what's next?
Uhh... Captain... What's the checklist say about this one?
After all that fuss in the Bay Area, Apple canceled the busses to iCloud.
Keep going ... he looks suspicious.
Is he cirrus?
And you didn't see anything either!
Lucky for him there are clouds in the sky.
I'm really seeing the ghost of Elvis, or else someone turned off the oxygen again.
Boy you can find all sorts of things in the CLOUD these days
Pull over, he has elite status.
Is he on Cloud 9 or 10?
See this is why I’m scared to save things to the cloud.
Since canabis was legalized we get a lot of sky high hitchhikers.
I was lost, but now I'm found!
I heard SpaceX just left him there.
Dang near everything's moving to the cloud.
No, they’ve never found D. B. Cooper.
Look! It’s D.B. Cooper! Think he’ll give us a cut if we pick him up?
I hope Shatner doesn't see him.
Even death doesn’t stop old Kerouac.
Welcome, I’m sure you were hoping this was LAX.
Maybe living on Cloud 9 ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.
He tried a stairway to heaven, even crawling part of the way. Now he’s trying to hitchhike. He won’t have any luck, but the cloud is a good touch.
"Hey! You! Get off of my cloud." ...How can I be having my granddad's flashback?
Aeronautics 101: cloud and carpet don't mix.
You want to report that?...no I don’t want to report it...!
Take the stairway to heaven.
It's amazing what can be sent to the Cloud now with the latest technology!
That's just dangerous! What if we were killers or something?
Look, Earl, it's one of those "Cloud Commuters."
Just ignore him. Fed Ex will pick him up. They have more room.
An escaped experiment from the ISS do you suppose ?
Funny, I never knew Amelia Earhart had a son...
Fine, but he's gotta take his shoes off first.
Don't slow down.....he looks high.
But what if it rains?
I won't pick up any people who don't show their feet.
Former traffic controller, they said he knew too much.
He's taking free frequent flyer miles to a higher level.
His bag would fit in the overhead, but something about this seems dicey.
We could drop him at Heaven's Gate.
Don't look. Just try to ignore him.
Picking him up will just encourage others.
Is Claudette Colbert Steve's grandmother?
Not unless he pays full fare.
Not so close Sully. You were just plain lucky with those geese.
Well done, the good news is you’re in heaven,..
Quick, throw him some Biscoff cookies so I don't feel guilty later!
He's starting his final ascent.
I'm not picking up another dead singer-songwriter.
Yes sir, he's up here a lot on the Asheville route.
He’s one of those lost souls you see every once and awhile still trying to find the “stairway to heaven”
I think I saw his laptop on The Appalachian Trail
Is that a thumbs up approval...Or does he need a ride to the airport?
Okay, but only if he'll chip in for gas.
People should think before they party up with Mick Jagger.
Stop! Pick him up! It's Douglas Adams!!
UberAIR must be down.
NRA convention or bust!
Don't stop, Carl. That guy's high.
'Have a good look at him Ted-we may pick him up on the way back'.
He's probably high.
He hasn't accepted his life in heaven yet.
Ah, folks, this is the captain. We're going to be making a quick stop, but we should still be able to get you to the gate a few minutes ahead of schedule, so sit back and enjoy the rest of the flight.
Damn hippies are everywhere
Because he has a bad altitude
Could we report this as an extratesterrial crisis?
The innocence, faith, and gumption of Basic Economy passengers is so endearing - but let's not stop
Either he's too high, or we're not high enough
These glaciers are getting smaller and smaller. Maybe we should pull up .
Well, everything else is in the cloud.
I gotta quit eating that gas station sushi.
Swing low, sweet chariot. If he can stand on a cloud, he can hang on a wing.
Sully, are you saving that one?
Elon Musk showing off again.
And I thought we were winging it
Talk about being left up in the air...
I'm not sure we can let him in with his emotional support cloud.
... Yep, then he'll ask for an upgrade.
You should try it, too. It's awesome.
Don't worry, that's Cloud Nine: he's doing fine.
Is that Neil Young?
Don't stop for him; that bag will never fit in the overhead bin.
We don't even have a scanner to check his passport and boarding pass.
I guess someone sent him to the cloud.
I always wondered what happened to Kerouac.
He’s gonna have to check that bag though.
It won't fit in the overhead.
Hippie
Should we stop and pick him up?
Galaxy Hitchhiker
I see United overbooked again.
Hey look Rodger Mcguinn is still 8 miles high!!
Now I understand why they call this route 'the highway to heaven'.
Yikes. Control tower requesting a lower altitude.
Ignore him. He’s selling another guide to the galaxy.
He's going the wrong way.
Don't stop, he's higher than a kite!
Do you think he's looking for Air B&B?
What’s he on?
I think it's time to put on the oxygen masks.
What else is he supposed to do? Mick Jagger kicked him off.
He sure gets around; yesterday we passed him over Omaha.
I wonder what he's high on?
On your left, a former passenger who finally found his lost luggage.
...You think he wants to go to Cloud 9, Captain ?
Attention passengers, please ignore the singer songwriter on cloud nine.
Sully would know what to do.
Captain, I think we should wait until we get to cloud 9.
This is just Cloud #8!
We can get you as high as one mile, but you’re on your own for the seven after that.
I think we have one seat left in economy class.
Lloyd, give him a thumbs-up back!
I think I know that guy.
OK, but only if he takes off his shoes and belt before boarding!
Flight 154 requesting permission to pick up Elon Musk at our next roundabout!
It’s Dunkin, good pilot, too bad the FAA job went so bad so quickly.
I too would like to take the flight pattern less traveled.
Should we reroute to cloud 9 to pick him up?
Sorry, first class is full.
Man, those hippies can sure get high!
Not again!
We'll pick up the next one, I promise.
Don’t worry about him, we’re going 600 miles an hour! And, how many times have I told you to keep your mits off the controls! I have the controls! Another thing, when are you supposed to get your pilots license?
Yessir Captain, very likely an enlightened hippie.
That's some serious weed if he got this high.
Like I said, everything’s in the Cloud these days!
-Captain! Why don't we pick him up once?
It's all well and good until you mention the baggage fee.
Don’t let our wing knock him off his stand!
Looks like Uber must be on surge-pricing.
Heaven help us. That fool thinks hitch hiking is safe.
Not another one
Ask Alexa what our wingspan is.
I blame SpaceX for this.
I wouldn't. I bet he hasn't had a bath for weeks.
Amelia Earhart did not age well.
This must be the new TSA Pre program.
We're just doing some background checks
Don't stop. My Nana says they carry germs.
Too bad we have a full flight.
He could be trying to hitch a ride, but in my honest opinion he’s just letting us know where doing a damn fine job!
Really, Dan? On our honeymoon?
I think he wants to get higher!
Sorry mate.. we’re headed UP
Reminds me of when I was young.
Cloud 9 is not all it’s cracked up to be.
There used to be an information highway around here.
I guess it does eliminate your wait in TSA security.
Some guys don't realize that the fog will soon or later lift.
No, I never read it. I saw the movie though.
Why don’t you just roll down the window and ask him if he’s an axe murderer?
Isn't that the troublemaker we threw off the outbound flight?
He’s an optimist.
Another one going to Cloud 9?
I hope United gave him a voucher.
Another Standby!
Look at him! Roaming and rambling, following his uppity footsteps! What does he think this is? An endless skyway? Who does he think this land was made for?
Oh oh, more Air Traffic Control cutbacks.
I told you we were too high.
It's that press secretary guy who got released from Trump Tower.
No screeners here. TSA wouldn’t like it.
Hey Bob, take a look...that one looks like a hitchhiker
I'm feeling fly pilot.
I'll turn my cell phone off, Promise!
It's against company policy to pickup hitchhikers.
A penny for your thoughts.
'How did he get through airport security without a ticket?' That is your question?
Cloudy with a chance of Meatloaf?
It is against the law to stop to pick him up. Bernoulli's Law.
If he’s come from above, we”ll take him. From below, not so fast.
I can't believe it! That backpack will never fit under his seat.
This new stand-by policy is so annoying.
I bet he's got more than 3 oz. of liquids in that backpack.
Do you think he's precheck?
By any chance are you passing cloud nine?
Don't do it Captain. That guy's higher than a kite.
William Shatner!
We do have an empty seat in economy.
Looks like another one got lost on the way to cloud nine.
Do you think he knows we're heading to Fargo?
Either he's too high or we are.
TSA goes at great lengths trying to trick us.
Well, if it isn't D. B. Cooper!
Don't stop. He must be high as a kite.
Just don't make eye contact with him.
Do you think Apple has gone too far with this iCloud thing?
They didn't cover this one in flight school.
I knew that storage in the cloud would get to this.
Some people go to new heights to hitch a ride
Looks like "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" wasn't science fiction after all.
I guess he took one of those cheap airlines where arriving is at extra-cost.
I realize the airline needs to increase profits, but this new way to make connections is for the birds.
There are easier ways to hitch a ride
Poor Fellow His parachute didn't open
i told you microdosing whips ass, dude. let's do another tab.
Sorry. We going up
Okay we've done the "other dimensions" exhibit, can we go to the Empire State building now?
Welcome to Colorado.
I just got an idea for a new fare class
But we don't travel to an alternate universe, Sir
Just act like you don't see him.
these flights out of Denver keep getting weirder
They're storing everything in the cloud these days.
We can give him a ride but we’ll have to charge him for the bag.
If that hitchhiker was able to get this far, I don't think he really needs us.
From a simpler, more trusting time ... wait, is that Timothy Leary?
No, I want to see the FAA regulation that says we can't.
I guess SpaceX still hasn't worked out those landings....
What would Sully do?
PULL OVER!
my wife said never pick up strangers
The rules are only if he's paying First Class.
Looks more hippie-dippy than boldly go.
Can you drop me at Cloud 9?
Gotta give the guy credit for patience, he's been waiting on that cloud since 1968.
I'm hoping we're just a figment of HIS imagination.
"Don't panic, he's just going to the restaurant at the end of the universe>'
"Is he on cloud nine?" - Pilot Left "Ugh, my name has been on the waiting list for months." - Pilot Right
Lazy bum. If he can levitate, he can fly himself.
I see the airline has implemented its new standby procedures.
As a frequent flyer he's fulfilled all the criteria...
The closest we can get you to Heaven is Miami.
It's sad. No one dresses up anymore
This must be what they mean by cloud computing.
Concentrate Captain, get your Ed out of the clouds!
I’d pick him up if we were one those cheap airlines!
I won't report it if you don't.
There's always one on every cloud!
It's he or us on LSD?
what page? in the manual, says one of us has to yell 'get a job!'
That guy looks high to me.
Yo!
No Sir, we picked him up last time.
Reminds me of the sixties.
By the looks of that frown we can guess where he's headed.
He's always there. By now you think he'd know we can't just stop.
Its cloud-based ride sharing.
Don't stop. The air is thin, his hair is thinner, and his stories of being a roadie would be the thinnest.
Ass, grass, or aviation fuel.
He is trying to get to Cloud 9
Yes, we have the thumbs up to land.
Holy cow! What is it with you and miracles, Sully?
We cannot afford to put a Dent on our plane.
Everybody wants to get to Heaven, but nobody wants to die.
Pretend that he's telling you that you're doing a good job at flying.
Pick up is easy, drop off is hard
Roger that, I said Jack Kerouac!
Either he's on an LSD trip, or we are.
Look, Elon on cloud nine!!!!
It's Colorado, they get high!
I'll bet he thought it was the bathroom door..
We could pick him up but he'd have to leave his guitar behind.
Remember, the new airline policy is that we don't stop for drifters.
He's totally out of his atmosphere.
These guys are always looking for an easy ride to Cloud 9.
Yeah, that's Elvis. He hangs out on this route all the time. Just ignore him.
Oh, he's on cloud 6. I never pick up on even numbers.
I would, but his bag looks a smidge oversize.
Don't take a chance... could be that D.B. Cooper fellow!
How can anyone possibly get that high?
Signal him that we're taking the next exit.
New carry-on policy.
Keep going - his carry-on is too large.
Another lucid dreamer.
Someone must have saved him to the cloud.
Is that Tom Hanks?
“Get a job”.
That bag is way too big to carry-on.
You hardly ever see hitchhikers anymore.
Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud!
Oh Boy.... That wing is going to hurt!
He's been high since the Sixties.
It seems everyone's trying to leave Earth.
Just how high are we?
you're cool guys! I just saw a red car and the driver was so rude that he didn't even look at me!
My mother told warned me to never stop for strangers, no matter how high you are.
Probably coming back after seeing the Dead.
Look, there's another one who got uploaded to the cloud.
They are getting so strict about frequent flier miles running out.
If you’re willing to fly standby you can get a really great price.
The guy's name is Arthur Dent and that means we may have a hard time finding some place to land.
HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY II (THE LEAN YEARS)
Captain that guy looks like he's lost!!
Don't stop for him Captain." "He looks like trouble.
We have an unidentified hitchhiking monkey at ten-o-clock. Please advise.
It's against company policy to pick up strangers.
Must have tampered with the lavatory smoke detector.
He's at 11o'clock -high.
Should we pick him up?" "No way. He looks like his head is in the clouds.
Either heaven is real or I still have my head in the clouds.
All these commercial airlines with rules. Back in my day we could just hitch a ride.
No, no. He's the one hallucinating.
?? ”Hitchikers In The Sky” ??
I TOLD you Michael Landon wore a toupee!
Your Uber Air has arrived.
We might as well pull over. I have to pee anyway.
He doesn't look like an angel to me.
F**king hipsters and their $500 pre-ripped jeans.
Don't stop for him, he looks high.
No one on board knows how to run the x-ray machine.
Isen’t that the guy we threw off the plane last trip for complaining about the Acini de Pepe?
This is a TV screen, NOT a painting. Visit three great art museums...that you're sure missing here: Fly to Houston, Philly or Detroit! Gt off your little island...and discover your country! (Brought to you by HPDArt.org}
Could you take me to Cloud 9?
23B is open but we can't spare the biscotti.
You think he knows 'Stairway to Heaven'?
I think he took the wrong stairway.
Better not stop, he looks high as a kite.
Doesn't he know we're overbooked?
It's a UTO. Unidentified Thumbing Object.
Those snowboarders are really getting big air these days.
Another overbooked customer...this is getting serious.
‘Perhaps we should lose a little height.’
He's been on the no-fly list since the Lindbergh days.
Whoa holy shit dude this is so improbable.
We’re not near a Correctional Facility, right?
He should dress warmer.
That's not Arthur Dent -- it's his brother, Harvey. Better not pick him up.
How can that backpack possibly hold enough helium?
Should we pick him up. He looks o.k.
On the right-hand side of the aircraft you'll get a nice view of the Grand Canyon, and if you're on the left, well, that's Clyde.
Nobody's had the heart to tell him that Woodstock is over.
I hear he's got the money for a ticket but will jump ship when it comes time to pay
It looks like this guy has his personal data stored on a thumb drive and in the cloud.
You think he would patch up his bluejeans if he was serious about getting a ride.
So much for the "SRO Economy Section!"
Sully, please tell me you didn’t just try another water landing.
Sorry, but those trousers aren’t even suitable for coach
Whatever you do, don't pick up DB Cooper.
I don't know, he looks a little gassy.
Good thing the door's locked - he's really high.
He thinks we're together.
I guess the golden plates didn't factor in inflation...
Wanderers like him just go where the wind blows
Can someone call the FBI...DB Cooper wants to hand himself in.
What do you mean, "Pull over!"?
He's thanking us for the fish.
I'd stop, but we only have a middle seat.
It's all about being in the cloud these days.
He must've flown halfway fare.
We can't just stop the plane for every guy who failed to earn his wings.
Isn't Cloud Nine on our route?
Come back with helicopter pick Jimmy up.
The 70’s called - they want their angel back.
I've seen him before. Wonder where the dog is?
We're not going to chance picking up some guy who hasn't been screened by the TSA.
Somebody's read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' a little too literally.
I told you, you cannot save miles to the Cloud
I heard cloud commuting was gaining followers.
I don't care if he's TSA Pre, we can't pick him up.
Don't make eye contact, he just wants to make you feel guilty for not stopping.
I don't know about this Gerald. We don't even know if his bag fits in the over head bin.
I remember when this place had such a rarefied atmosphere
No, it's Iowa.
It’s our newest Economy Basic.
Keep going, that guy looks as high as a kite!
I sometimes wish that I had chosen to reach a higher plane in a pure manner like that fellow rather than the way we do it.
Do you think he knows why no one stops?
Always trying to leave Cloud Nine, that one there!
He takes "cloud storage" a little too literally!
Don't stop, just keep going - he appears to be high.
These UFO's are really getting creative.
This is your captain speaking. We've just been given the thumbs up to make our descent.
Mother warned me to never pick up hitchhikers.
He must have missed his connecting flight.
He must have Air Jordans.
Hey, Ace! There's another Cloud Storage homeless IT guy!
Wow. I remember those days.
There's an idea....let's start a cloud-enabled ride-sharing service!
He's waiting for the Uber helicopter.
As long as he doesn't need to check his bag, I guess it would be ok.
Could be worse ... at least he's not on our wing.
Hey, it's better than when they clap.
How bad must he hate TSA lines?
Don't stop! I think he's an American and armed!
Sorry pal -- sky's the limit.
No, but throw him one of those bags of peanuts.
Torn jeans are so passe.
Is there a Grateful Dead concert coming up?
Tower, that's affirmative. We've past cloud 9.
Flying the not-s-friendly skies.
FAA Rule 12-B states not to pick up hitch-hikers with parachutes.
He must be standing flyby
Hope the wing clears him.
Was that a hitchhiker on a cloud?
Check the altimeter.
Look, Elon on cloud nine!!!!
We can't pick him up, he hasn't been appropriately screened by airport TSA!
Where’s the green light when you need it.
The magazine dated Feb. 26, 2018 arrived on Feb. 26th..a day after the deadline for the cartoon caption contest. Here is my entry anyway:  "The World's First Interactive Two-Way Museum Exhibit"
Oh, this guy. He won't get on unless he can sit in first class.
So he thinks he can get a free ride to the Pearly Gates?
But supposing he’s really an angel and this is a test of some kind?
I thought they said he wasn't a flight risk.
Ah, another hitchhiker trying to get a ride to the galaxy.
That may explain a lot. I guess that wasn't a near-miss after all.
Another Easy rider
Let's just check to see if he has any Bud Light, and then decide.
Don’t stop. Last time I picked one up he had a comfort hawk.
There's another one trying to get into Canada.
Double check our altitude, roger that.
I don't disagree. But that bag won't fit comfortably under the seat in front of him.
I think that may be the guy that lost all my emails!
no ticket no fly
Guess we're not in Kansas any more.
The poor guy lost his NRA member discount mid flight.
We must be over Colorado - another pothead on cloud 9.
Why does he want to go down to earth?
This has been happening so often since they legalized marijuana.
Keep going, it's Rutger Hauer!
Cloud commuting. It's new and don't ask me to explain.
And if you look out the left window you'll see Tom in Customer Service thanking you all for flying with us today.
They'll let anyone in the mile high club these days
When the angelic host leaves, it's a bummer.
It's a new cabin class. We call it "A Wing and a Prayer."
Must have lost his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
We'll just throw him in economy.
You see this when they stop playing Stairway to Heaven.
Think United kicked him off?
Fasten your seat belts and close your blinds. We're in for some bloody turbulence.
Don’t pick him up. He has a carry on.
I'm afraid of what'll happen if we don't pick Him up.
Uber's spoiled everybody.
Don't stop. He's high.
We're not supposed to pick up hitchhikers.
Who does he think we are…Southwest?
Are you sure we're at 30,000 feet?
I'd stop, but the overhead bins are full.
How the hell did we end up FLYING the stairway to heaven?
Don't complain,I don't have enough paint!
He's already on cloud eight; he can get the rest of the way by himself.
Am I going crazy?" "No, he is. After all, he's the one riding the NIMH-bus.
I heard it was going to rain aliens this afternoon.
He's really wound up today.
Pull over. See if he'll chip in gas money.
Looks like Steve Jobs. Those Apple maps ARE bad!
I TOLD you that Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy was real!
Hey Brian, is that a hitchhiker or hijacker?
I wouldn't. That's not Cloud 9.
Roger captain.....I mean it's Roger McGuinn. We're abut to have a Byrd strike!!
That guy must be really high.
Sure, it's impossible to breathe, but look at all the legroom he has!
Would you have picked him up if he were better dressed?
My son works in IT and said cloud commuting is the future.
Some people will do anything to avoid removing their shoes before boarding.
Pick me up, I might be Jesus!
I guess Cloud 9 doesn't have Uber.
Non-premium standby.
Congratulations on your retirement, Captain. It's a shame you're delusional.
'He looks way too high.'
Must be the guy who wrote the "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"
Ever since he read 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' he's impossible.
Looks like another hacker got sucked up by the cloud
I'd stop but his bag wouldn't fit in the overhead compartment.
Don't stop, he's probably high on something.
A few from the 70s got really, really, high.
He was ejected from the Newark to Akron flight: Birkenstocks with no socks.
We've seen a lot more of those guys since California legalized marijuana.
We can't, remember this is non-stop to LA.
I really like flying this new route up the California coast.
And even if we did, you think he'd pay the over-sized carry-on surcharge?
It's not so rosy out here on Cloud Four.
Really? He's going to dress like that and expect us to pick him up?
This guy must be high.
Can you please drop me at Mars?
I'd stop, but the overhead compartments are all full.
No I never read Douglas Adams.
Gee its true, an angel has to earn its wings.
I think it would be okay. He seems nice.
I guess there's no room left for angels ever since the internet went on the cloud.
You see more and more of this now that California has legalized marijuana.
Don’t stop he looks high as a kite.
Deadhead.
Somehow I feel that we're damned if we do and damned if we don't offer him a ride.
I thought being on cloud nine was supposed to be a good thing.
He was on cloud 9 yesterday.I wonder what happened?
Is that the guy from "Going my way"?
Halt,who goes there
I mean, I usually pick up hitchhikers, but we're late already and I'm not sure that we can safely pull over.
Look, another Millennial fed up with putting everything on the cloud.
I always stop for hitchhikers and this will be no exception
So I Cloud actually means everyone gets their own cloud?
Do we have a galaxy map on board?
Must be one of those “big air” snowboarders from Pyeongchang!
Don't bother radioing, they wont believe you!
We've got room...
God only knows what he is waiting for
Potential Hitch Hiker to the Galaxy...
Don't stop - he looks like trouble.
I think he was the inspiration for A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
Find out if he's got grass or gas. Don't even mention ass.
If his name is D.B.Cooper, we'd just be in trouble.
Uhh, well, folks. Uhhhh, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, uhhhh, you'll get a glimpse of a man, uhhhh, hitchhiking on a cloud.
This is my last blind data at the iCloud.
Do you think we should?
Now descending into 1968, please feel free to smoke and invite the stewardess out for a cocktail..."
That California Home-Grown must be really something!
He doesn't realize he already got the ultimate upgrade.
Looks like Mr. Musk has lost another rocket.
He should have taken the down to Earth Retirement Package
Sorry, we're a non-stop.
Watch that port engine for a bumstrike!
OMG, that's the guy we dragged from his seat yesterday...
It's just Douglas Adams. Who knew he was still in this galaxy?
Edit your files on all your devises, backup all your data, the benefits of the Cloud are amazing!
Heaven or bust!
How many times have I told you? Don't make eye contact!
Another problem that could be solved with more mental hospitals.
Aim for the Hudson.
Where do you suppose he thinks we're going?
Heaven and Hell are full. Can you take me to The Black Lodge?
That's Ford Prefect still looking for flight 42
Would Trump call him a DREAMER?
He thinks he is on the Highwayvto Heaven
We could stow him with Cargo.
That's the same spot I dropped him off yesterday.
Sully, let's stop.
Wow, that guy must REALLY high!
Nice touch. In flight simulstor humor
Looks like Douglas Adams lost his book again.
Look, it's right there on the charts - Holy Hitchhiker on left.
I told you we shouldn't get high!
Did you hear they failed to renew DACA?
If he's still here on the return trip let's give him a lift.
His position is too nebulous.
Geez, DT's pilot! "Thanks fellas, I'll take the next one.
What a heartless place for his last ride to have dropped him off.
No need to stop. He's already on cloud nine.
Sorry, sir but I don't think we are the type of sky pilot you are looking for.
Don’t stop. Could be a “wing” nut.
I stopped for him once. Big mistake.
Another NRA member feeling the loss
We'd like to stop but we just don't have any room.
You know how dangerous it is to pick up a hitchhiker. Obviously, something is clouding your judgement.
I think he thinks we're an Uber.
Isn't that the guy who jumped with the ransom?
We can pick him up on the way back.
My Way or the High Way, even with wings.
Doesn't he know that we don't take standbys anymore?
If you dont look at him he won't notice us.
No way! He's standing on a cloud and he wants a ride from us? Not with that carry-on...
Maybe if he had a sign saying where he's headed...
Either he's caught between heaven and hell or I have to change my meds.
It's not hi-tech...that's a wind-up key in my back...
With Trump's NASA funding, returning home from outer space is getting harder and harder.
Don't pull over; he didn't check his bag.
His bag won't fit in the overhead.
Hop in. But you’ll need to pay a fee for the carry-on.
I think he was left off there by Delta, as part of their new fare system.
Does he realize we're going to Cleveland?
We're not stopping. It will only encourage him.
He cloud storage business did great for a while.
Nope. Strictly against regs.
Do you think he’s trying to hitch a ride to Cloud 9?
They never should have legalized pot !
Recreationally legal in 9 states, plus D.C.
The FAA frowns on hitchflyers.
How many ‘cloud reservation’ paranomasia can this caption contest stomach?!?
Don't stop, Jerry. He looks high.
Keep it up!
I was bumped off the last flight going this way.....
Watch me show this dirty hippie where he put that thumb of his." "Geez, Sully.
maybe Woodstock lives on
He needs an outbound that's not overbooked
Whoa! I still have two million unused frequent flier miles with you guys.
We must be comin' up on Cloud Nine.
So that's why they never found D.B. Cooper.
The altitudes people will go to just to get a free ride!
Don't stop. He's got a backpack and the overhead bins are full.
Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Naw, Cloud 9 isn't on our flight path.
I’d pull over, but he looks a little shady.
Wow, look at all that legroom.
Should we stop?
Captain: Could that be Jerry? Co-Pilot: Who's that?
If we can see him, it means that he's not there.
Don't get any crazy ideas, Sully.
I just can't wait to get on the road again.
I don't remember anything prohibiting hitchhikers in the manual, but I really don't think that duffel would fit in the overhead bin.
Doesn't he already have a lift?
Can you give me a lift? I Good Morning on,y way to cloud 9
When there is no where else to go...
Can't. That backpack won't fit in the overhead.
I've heard of lost souls, but this is getting ridiculous
Air traffic control says he got on the wrong plane bound for Cleveland but he wants to go to Tucson
I'm not falling for THAT again.
Don't Worry. He's the Guide to the Galaxy.
Now the homeless are up here!
Port side passengers can view our competitors economy class option.
So much for Stairway to Heaven.
I knew legalizing marijuana might lead to strange things but I never expected this.
We picked him up just yesterday, didn't we?
Even hitchhiking is cloud based.
Wasn't that Timothy Leary?
I don't see him either . . .
He needs to patch up those pants.
He's obviously high.
Maybe, the bed was too soft for his tastes.
You are cleared for Pearly Gate 9!
I've heard that miracles come in "threes". In your case Sully number two could be to your immediate left. What the hell, let's give him a ride.
Wonder if he had to thumb an elevator to get here?
I gave him a ride last week
That Kerouac never gives up!
I’d like to, but mom told me never to pick up hitchhikers.
And here I thought The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a work of fiction...
When did Neil Young die?
Maybe he thinks we're Jefferson Airplane.
We seem to be approaching Denver...
He really should use the entrance ramp.
We had the mushroom salad at lunch didn't we.
Ask him if his liquids exceed 3.4 ounces per container.
I’m homeless and I need to get to California.
Another iCloud
Why doesn’t he just get a rip cord?
He's been looking for the Jefferson Airplane since 1974.
Another heaven dropout.
Let's not pick him up. He might be high.
Does he mean we should increase elevation?
He’s a little too scruffy looking.
A ride? In his dreams!
We’ll pick you up on the return flight.
Cloudy with a chance of a pick-me-up
Not again!
He must have missed the stairway to heaven.
You should probably let him board. He wrote the guide.
Darn hippie never got off his cloud.
All practicalities aside, I really admire the stubborn persistence of these small, cloud-based commuting start-ups.
Just ignore him. He hasn’t been cleared by the TSA
He upgraded his HiCloud account and flies free.
He'll be there for days, not traffic by this cloud.
Can you see? is that a man or is it Monkey?
Whoa! This is high! Where did he get this stuff?
Well, we could drop him off at Valhalla.
I haven't seen one this high up since Woodstock.
I know how it looks -- but when he pulls the rip-cord, we'll feel silly.
We can drop him off in hobo heaven before we land.
No way! There's a prison below not five miles from here.
Poor fellow, I can't help him. It's against our Galaxy Air rules to pick up hitchers.
I have an uncontrollable urge to sing "Going My Way".
Ever notice, more and more of them are using the cloud.
Higher than a kite?
Captain, what hitchhiker?
Its been like this since the legalization of Marijuana.
I would love to help your out but TSA rules advice against it. Its all good. I am on cloud nine.
No, Gary, I don't feel comfortable.. you fly a ufo half way cross the galaxy and get left on the side of a cloud... there's more to that story--we ain't stoppin!
When did they start sending standby passengers to the cloud?
Hitching a ride on a higher plane
It happens over recreational use states.
I have GOT to lay off of slamming martinis before each flight...
Must have been saved on someone's personal 'cloud' and is trying to get deleted.
Those hippies are always trying to achieve a higher plane
(No caption needed - the picture is great!)
Isn't that the same guy we saw trying to hitch a ride to the airport?
With all these new marijuana laws this was bound to happen.
The homeless problem is worse than I thought.
Normally, I’d stop, but he looks really high!!!
Don't make eye contact. He only wants money.
I wonder whether he’s heading to heaven or hell?
I wonder what airline dropped him off?
He's dreaming of the empty seats we had back in the day.
First it's hitchhikers, then it's Uber!
Nah. Let's not. He's probably only going as far as the next cumulonimbus.
Don’t call it in. They’ll put it on your psychiatric record and your promotion will be toast.
He' s been reading too much Douglas Adams.
Sky bridge is out again.
No easy ride for him, sir; Jared is out of the loop now his security clearance has cancelled!
He's been waiting there forever.... Maybe someone should tell him there ain't no heaven no more?
Looks as if Trump cancelled funding for the moon-expedition last year."
It's amazing! No matter where we go, we see the homeless. This poor guy is trying to hitch a ride into heaven. If it were only that simple.
Have you been counting? I think this is the 9th cloud we've seen him on this morning.
It’sD.B.Cooper and looks like he still has the cash.
These clouds really are dense.
Wow, that guy is high as a kite!
Yeah, you can get really high with the new stuff.
Go ahead. I'll take the next one.
I don't think we should pick him up. He looks as high as a kite.
How high is he?
Isn’t that the guy we bumped at the gate.
How about a ride? The Tesla driver panicked and flew right past me.
Sir ..........It's a Russian bot in the cloud!
Now he's really pressing his luck on that "silver lining" to hold up
This is the third time this week we have seen Elon Musk up and about
Looks like they closed Area 51 again
Just don't make eye contact.
Sorry fella. The cabin door was closed for take-off, and you know the rules.
I heard some of the other airlines were ejecting passengers
I Think he was on our last flight
To Cloud Nine, please.
Another one who just read the Cliff Notes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
Don't look at him.
I've heard of a hitchhiker in a cloud, but... Oh, wait -- turns out I have a cyst on my ovary.
What was in those cough pills you gave me?
Captain, should we pick him up?” “I don’t know, do you think he’s high?
I told them ticket prices were too high.
Remember when the Eurail pass was all the rage?
I didn't have enough points to qualify for airport pickup. They said you'd find me along the way.
We don't have to decide...he's hitchhiking the other way.
Since we’re lost, no harm in asking him to guide us to Mars
I look at clouds from both sides now.
I mean, it's not like we don't have room...
Well what do you know, looks like there is something worse than flying coach...
He's obviously very high right now.
You know we can’t pick him up unless he’s gone through TSA screening.
This may be one of those two-way mirrors. I'll bet there's someone on the other side staring at us right now!
This younger generation of flying monkeys wants everything handed to them.
It's gotta be our new THC branding.
He's got no ass and probably no gas, but he may have some grass. I say we pick him up.
Did you eat the chicken with mushrooms?
He sure LOOKS like D.B. Cooper!
I think I know that guy.
He's President of the Mile High Club.
Another sixties hippie that got really high,
There wasn't supposed to be a cloud in the sky today.
He should have taken a Left at Albuquerque!
First they cancel the NRA discount, then they tell us no more deadheads.....
I say no; he looks high to me.
He's do'in fine - on cloud nine.
He's definitely not one of the clouds' illusions I recall.
Do you think we’re a little too high?
I know company policy doesn't allow it, but damn, this guy is good.
He claims that he has gold status and a million mileage points that he's never been able to use.
Geeze, Evelyn must of packed the bridge club’s brownies again.
Let’s see if he knows the way to San Jose.
Looks like the stork never made it.
Nope, we don't do that anymore.
For Heaven's sake, we can't fly that far up!
Looks a lot like Scott Adams
Ah, captain. What does the blinking red light on the terrain avoidance thingy mean?
Too much carry on right?
You only go around once.
Another hitchhiker? Well, this is a Virgin Atlantic flight, not Virgin Galactic!
Are you kidding? He's high as a kite!
He looks dangerous.Let’s wing him.
He looks higher than a kite and probably smells like ozone.
I saw him in standby, which he obviously did not need.
Hey, isn’t that DB Cooper?
Absolutely not, let him call Uber!
How do we know he's going to Philadelphia?
If we weren't full I'd stop to give him a lift.
I swear it's Clark Gable! Go around again and see if we can't get Claudia Colbert showing some nice leg.
He wouldn't have a prayer if we don't give him a ride.
'Can't go on...everything I had is gone with the wind..."
No, we’re not pulling over! Look at him; he’s high!
He must have been with the guru on the mountain.
We're not going to the galaxy, we're going to Vegas.
Ok fine, kicking passengers off flights has gotten a little out of hand
We get a lot of drifters on this route.
I don't think he registered his flight plan.
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud. Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd On my cloud, baby
Snopes said that was a hoax.
This recreational marijuana thing is getting out of hand.
Don’t stop to pick him up. There’s no more room in first class.
Okay, but remember what happened with that hitch-hijacker over Tulsa.
When you fly enough miles, you start seeing the same people.
We’re only Terrestrial. He’ll have to wait for the next Space Probe.
Keep going and try not to make any eye contact.
That's Neil Young. Boy is he high!
Looks like they've changed the flying standby policy.
I'm in limbo, man!
We used to pick them up, but baggage fees changed all that.
He probably has a dog hiding in the clouds.
He had memories.
Obviously high on something.
*No way. Obviously he's high on something.
I never understood why the industry labeled Douglas Adams's novels as "fiction."
Even if it IS Benjamin Schwartz, company policy is "No Hitchhikers".
Nah, we can't. No way that bag is under 50 pounds...
We got any open seats?
He's taken homelessness to a new level.
Lord knows where he's headed....
Hey Captain, which should I cover on my travel bingo card, hippy or hitchhiker?
This is what happens when we let them save their reservations on the cloud.
This feels like a test.
Don't enable him. If no one stops he'll realize he has to get an Airbus of his own.
All this to avoid the baggage fee?
Don't stop, these are not the friendly skies.
Dumb, but way cool.
Perhaps storing The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the cloud wasn't such a great idea, after all.
There's that crazy high-tech guru from iCloud again!
one of us is going the wrong way and i think its us
To be honest, it might be nice to hear someone else's life story for a change.
Now everything’s in the cloud.
You're right. He's CLEARLY high.
I’d offer him a ride, but I think he’s high.
For the last time, it's not a jet plane, John Denver!
Hey, I think we found DB Cooper.
Those IT guys never get it until it's too late. Once you move to the cloud, it's hard to find a way back.
We could take him as far as Vegas.
The FAA won't allow us to pick up passengers that high
Do you think pot is legal up here?
Guess things are pretty bad up here TOO!
Ever since that stairway to heaven opened, it's really changed the neighborhood.
Ok, our last stop!
Looks like I definitely picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.
Must be a freak-went flyer.
Looks like cloud nine wasn't all he thought it'd be.
Douglas Adams again.
Ignore. It's 3D flight simulation for kids.
Who thought planes should uber?
We've gotten several likes after I changed our travel status to Wherever Your Poor Life Choices Take Us
Oh my! He took to flying standby quite literally.
I haven't picked up a hitchhiker since the late '60s. How about you?
He’s on cloud 9! He wants to leave?
Man... I think we’re to “high”!
Don't. You'll just encourage him.
Live from The New Yorker, it's Saturday night!
I don't like hippie hitch hikers either, but he is on cloud 9.
His cloud-about must have run out of fuel.
Cloud nine ain't what it used to be!
Yet another broke Pyeongchang snowboard loser still pursuing his dream.
I guess 30,000 feet is the border between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
Can’t do it, overhead bins are full.
Keep Flying...He wants to go to New Haven. He can't spell.
Sully..... Free Bird strike.
He must be going to Cloud 9.
Has anyone seen Jeff? Oh shit..how'd he get out there?
I think I saw that guy at a Dead show back in '85.
He must think we're the Galaxy.
Group twenty must be boarding
Let him wait for the Airbus.
I think he’s trying to get to Cloud 9.
Is that your only contact on the G cloud?
I'll pick him up on one condition: He has to check the bagpipes.
Keep going! The last time we picked someone up it was a ride to hell!
The previous flight must have been oversold.
Budget airlines can go out of business so quickly these days.
So that's what gets you up here -somebody better tell John McCain.
Let him walk.
Don't bother. He's stepping through to the next galaxy.
I would stop but there is no room for his bag.
Didn't we just pass cloud nine?
Keep going, Drew. His bag is over regulation.
We have space, but he'll have to check his bag.
Don't stop, he looks a little sketchy.
Yeah, ...air traffic control? He claims he's lost his lawn chair tied to a lot of balloons
Isn't that the guy who wouldn't check his bag?
Better dip that left wing a little, Bert.
Pilot 1: Uber hasn't gone aerial yet. Should we tell him? Pilot 2: He must have missed that email. It's not my problem.
Hey Sully? I'm beginning to think you didn't miraculously pull us out of that nose dive.
I think we just crossed the highway to heaven!
I can't quite tell if that's his thumb or middle finger
Sully, if that's D. B. Cooper think of the sequel they'd shoot if you gave him a ride.
Can't he just take the stairway to heaven?
Absolutely, do NOT stop to pick this guy up - he never has gas money!
Look it’s Cloud 69
Yup, everything’s in the cloud now.
There he is again. Doing fine, fine, fine on cloud nine.
No more brownies for me. I think I'm high enough.
Apparently the right-wing poverty solution is to store the homeless in the cloud..
Quite a layover.
Hey, didn't we see him above Lubbock last week?
How do you think the homeless get to New York.
Tell him we're not allowed to stop for hitch hikers.
Colorado
Not as many hitchhikers nowadays as there used to be
Says his name is Poppins? I'm not buying it.
What if he's a hitchhijacker?
He's high as a kite.
Don't let him board. He's higher than a kite.
The Cloudman Cometh
He’s already on cloud nine!
Think that's a thumbs up because we're doing such a great job, or because he wants us to take him closer to heaven?
Too bad we don't make flights to Hell
Is this what they mean by, "the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy?"
I knew the wall would become obsolete
He told the Genie he wanted to get high...
Hitching? Maybe. But hiking? I don't think so.
"The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy"devotees from the seventies are still out there.
Just chip in $20,000 for gas
Sorry, but we don't stop for hitchhikers.
Isn't that Jeff Bezos?
Hey, I know that guy!
Hitchhikers guide to galaxy
Sorry men, we have a full flight
Damn! We are going the other way
I've seen several of these since pot was legalized.
Hello Seattle tower, we've found DB Cooper!
I gusss he did not hear about the new bag policy in Hitchhiker Class.
I think I've been reading too much Douglas Adams.
We'll pick him up on our way back if it doesn't rain.
He must’ve gotten so high that he missed Cloud 9.
Nah, he might be dangerous.
That's the third one this week!
They don't let us drink. Maybe they shouldn't let us eat mushrooms, either.
Are we low or is he high?
Another one looking for cloud nine.
Here at United, we take unruly behavior very seriously.
If we add an extra passenger, I'll tell the crew to give Mr. Shatner a Xanax.
Now approaching Denver International.
We can't do it. All of the vacancies are in first class.
Sorry Buddy, we're nonstop.
Snowflakes... always looking for a free ride.
You're still going to have to pay full price, Mr. LaPierre.
Remind me again about the last time you gave D.B. a lift.
His jetpack must have run out of fuel again!
Up for a ride?
Looks like United’s already been here this morning.
Don’t stop, he’s definitely high.
They must have found his Comfort Cockroach.
Probably another one of those high tech guys who works on cloud based solutions
Enough of Cloud storage, eh!
Where’s Gus and Ezra?
Hitchhiker's ride to the galaxy?
Oh my god! It’s D. B. Cooper!
Don't stop, he only wants to use our bathroom.
He’s still high from Woodstock.
He bought a seat on the wing.
I'd give him a lift if he didn't have such a large carry-on.
I guess people don't change. Down there, he'd only fly standby too.
That new standby ticket program is murder...
He's living on a prayer.
No way. He looks high.
He must be giving us a thumbs up. I don't think he needs a lift.
I say we keep going. I don't like his altitude.
This is your Captain speaking. If you look out the left side of the plane you'll see we've just crossed the Sierras and entered California.
Sorry pal, too much carry-on.
Drift over and I’ll get him with the door.
Don’t stop for this guy. He’s got an emotional support bazooka in that bag.
Isn't that the guy we dropped on Cloud 9 last week?
Passengers only get annoyed by the creatures on the wings.
It's a good thing they don't test for shrums.
Not with my peanut allergy....
Which do you think it is: gas, grass or ass?
Yes, this is cloud nine, but not what it used to be!
Everything's on the Cloud these days?
We’re not stopping.
Somebody told me that the Hebrew word for hitchhiker is "Trampist".
Teleportation aliens and airplanes. I hear Roswell New Mexico calling.
No, that's not D.B. Cooper. No, that's snow not clouds, and no, you can't steer the plane.
What was in those brownies?
We're on a direct flight to Heaven! Can't stop for every hitchhiking prisoner, politician or sexual scalawag ... as ... the plane would capsize before we could ever rise above the clouds!
They've been flying high since pot's been legal.
Don't stop. Looks like one of those European socialists to me.
Our altitude gauge may not be accurate…
Don't stop, he's probably high on something.
His name is Arthur Dent.
May I suggest ,no more “special” brownies before takeoff.
Yesterday we saw a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias.
I knew DB Cooper was still alive.
I'd help him out, but I can't remember my password to the Cloud.
This could mean one of us is pulling up to the wrong gate.
I'm afraid our skies aren't that friendly.
Nope. TSA does not allow passenger uploads from the cloud.
Flying standby is so iffy these days.
I think the manual prohibits picking up hitchhikers, but my memory is a bit cloudy...
Only if he chips in for gas.
Look, there's Joe ! Too bad we can't stop and give him a ride.
Remember what happened last time we picked up that hitch hiker?
Should we pick him up? Nah, he looks shifty.
O my God, is that William Shatner?
Cap'n Sully, can you rescue him from reliving Woodstock?
Do we have any jump seats left?
I'm reminded of that Twilight Zone episode...
Hey Gary, you feeling anything yet?
Let’s make an exception. This guy looks like he really needs a lift.
Urban myth?
He's dreaming!
We are seeing a lot of this lately. Apparently heaven is expelling everyone who does not now qualify for merit based immigration.
The baby boomers have stopped trying to change heaven, I guess.
OK, but he has to pay a $50 same day change fee.
Sorry but Uninted sold us out, ask the guy we kicked out a few miles back.
I gotta get more sleep.
Sorry, we don't offer cloud services.
Just look at that guy. What a life. Hitchhiking, footloose and fancy free....boy, he must be on cloud 9!
Oh no! I told ya not to go into that swirling vortex just to make up time. Now we're stuck in one of those "Twilight Zone" things!
Doesn't he know this thing can't stop on a dime?
I don't know how he thinks he's getting a lift with that oversized carry-on.
Oh my God!! It's Doug Adams!!
Wait till you see who's on cloud 9
First Elon Musk, and now everyone wants a ride to the galaxy.
It’s not that unusual. He gets high a lot.
Don't stop...you'll upset the passengers...
That guy looks like my mother.
Another strike against the companies policy on not taking pictures.
He's looking for a miracle.
I am the Evel Knievel of Plane Jumping.
He must have run out of frequent flyer miles!
Oh, It is just that Adams guy hitchhiking the universe.
Let him in. It’s a long flight. We could use a little levity.
You really never know how high they are when you pick them up.
I've hear of being on cloud 9 but, I didn't think hitchhiking was allowed.
Better not; I hear there is a cirrocumulus asylum nearby.
Hey Sully, that’s the same guy we left on Cloud 9.
Look straight ahead and pretend we don't see him.
We don't have time for a stop at the Space Station. Another plane should be by soon.
I guess cloud nine's not all it's cracked up to be.
No matter how many times you see them up here it really takes your breath away.
I said layover, not pull over!
It once was Cloud 9.
Wasn't he here last week?
I always feel a little guilty when we don’t stop for these guys.
You are now free to move about the Country
Damned hitchhikers -- they're always getting high.
I shouldn't have had that 3rd martini...
Going my way? Don't think so.
Don't pick him up. Last time all he could talk about was "The Cloud, the Cloud, Horrors!"
Hey, slow down and hand me those firecrackers!
They start appearing once you cross the border of California.
Don't disturb him, it's Cloud Nine.
that's what happens when you first get a prostate exam
He must be looking for Spirit Airlines.
All these refugees everywhere.
Yeah, but what if he's one of those weirdos?
Better not pick him up. Looks like he's on drugs.
Come on, Sully. You got this!
I'd pick him up but I don't think he has gone through the security check point.
"I really thought we'd finish this flight without a hitch".
Those partial refunds are getting way too common.
Don't pull over, that hitchhiker looks high.
Let's ask if anyone would like to give up their seat for this guy.
Damn - I uploaded myself to the cloud. . . I just wanna get home!
He got bumped from the earlier flight
Wow...flying stand-by is tougher than ever...
We can't just because we're a non-stop flight?
little far from the galaxy. I guess he never got his guide.
Maybe we should check the oxygen.
No, I’m sure the altimeter was on your check list
Well at least this hallucination is not as scary as the one in that Twilight Zone episode.
David Mitchell.
You'd think if he can get here, he could get anywhere... Must lack the motivation to get further in life.
Yes, we could give him a lift, but TSA would never forgive us.
I am guessing that is D. B. Cooper
Don't stop, he seems to be high
Poor guy, looks like he ran out of cloud storage.
Cloud travel seems sensible in an age of cloud computing.
Don't stop - he creeps me out.
I think we overshot. That’s Cloud 10.
He's going to have to check that.
It appears that Mr. Musk is having problems with cash flow.
It's amazing air travel has progressed so much and yet there are still no women pilots.
Let's pass. Word on the radio is she was kicked off her last flight for insisting she be given a full can of soda.
He doesn't look happy. I only pick up hitch-hikers on Cloud 9.
That solves the D.B.Cooper mystery.
Flying standby can be so risky these days.
Air traffic control is calling us incredulous, but he is the one full of hot air.
What's the opposite of a frequent flyer?
We must be over Colorado, cause that guy is really high!
Hey, that looks like the same guy I saw hitching in the middle of the freeway as I was driving to the airport.
Not with that carry-on!
Don’t mind him. He’s just researching for his book, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
Someone needs to tell this guy he's going to be waiting here for an eternity.
Heading towards cloud nine?
Poor beggar, all he has left is what he put in the cloud.
Hey, isn’t that DB Cooper?
He could use ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.’
"Sure, we could. But if he's using a chip card, we'll never make it on time." (Note: "never" italicized)
I wonder what he's smoking... And why isn't he sharing some of it...
You hardly ever see anyone with a Group 11 boarding pass.
Don’t stop, he’s just waiting for Uber’s cloud service
Pilot: Hey, lets stop for this guy. Hitchhiker: Thanks, I only want a ride if you support PETA. Pilot: *drops chicken wing* Never mind we're full.
Maybe if his carry on wasn't so big . . .
Let's pick him up, our next stop is Woodstock.
Ordinarily I'd pick him up, but this is a dangerous place to stop.
Don't stop; it might be a trick.
I just don't trust guys who wear cargo pants.
There's no cardboard sign. Keep flying.
Looks like Arthur Dent to me.
Cloud Lyft? I mean I had to ask. It’s like he’s offering up his thumb as a souvenir.
We might have a problem with our altimeter.
Do you think he will mind that this is a full flight and his carry-on will have to be checked in until we reach destination?
I didn't see him either
Fine, we'll let the passengers decide then.
He'd have better luck if he weren't insistent on going to LaGuardia.
Not yet. You'll know by the guy when we get to Cloud 9.
How did he even make it up here?
You don't earn as many miles, but there's usually an empty seat
These angels need to get a job!
You don't see many of them anymore...
And if you look very closely, that cloud looks like a hitchhiker.
I'm not sure we should give him a lift, he looks like a bit of a floater
I'd stop for him if he hadn't already reached his destination.
Uh, gee, you know, Jim, despite the hitchhiking and bohemian style of dress, considering his cruising altitude alone, I think there’s more you could have said about him than just “Wow, he’s really working hard to do the non-conformist vibe."
The last one I stopped for couldn’t afford to check his luggage.
I wouldn't stop. I hear this is a bad section of sky.
Happens all the time when we pass Cloud 9.
And I thought our company's economy class was bare bones.
In flight school they warned us about stopping to pick up hitchhikers, no matter how angelic they appear.
He can get on, but the bag is not free.
I guess he forgot the lyrics "You can't catch a jet plane like you can a freight train.
I say we put him in 2B next to Pruitt.
Is there still a reward for D.B. Cooper?
I guess cloud nine's not all it's cracked up to be.
Welcome to Frontier Airlines.
You would think He'd give his only son a ride.
Doesn't this guy know not to hitchhike near remote cabins?
He is in I cloud and forgot his password.
And looking out the left side of the plane, you'll see an apparition of the life I wish I'd led.
And to your left passengers is just another day tripper.
pretend you don't see him
He's got to be High!
He looks high to me.
After his job fishing at DreamWorks, he's been trying to make his way down.
No guide, no galaxy, I guess.
I don't know how we passed the drug and alcohol test.
I hear he’s a bit smug. I don’t like his altitude.
You'd think an i-cloud guys would know about Uber or LYFT.
D.B. Cooper, I presume.
The TSA really stinks.
Roger?
I don’t think his backpack will fit in the overhead, captain.
My mother told me not to pick up hitchhikers.
He should have flown the nonstop.
Did you have the lunch with mushrooms?
So this is where Regan's air traffic controllers wound up!
Thumbs up is Ok, but I stop if they want a sandwich.
On your left, ladies and gentlemen, the rarest of birds, a millennial overachiever.
It's the latest trend in the airline industry. You can get a ticket to half way there.
Whoa, I dropped him off on cloud nine three years ago!
Look right..We are a non stop flight
That's a sure way to get around airport screening and security.
What is he smoking?
He's doing well.....Last time I saw him was over Singapore.
Captain, I always wondered if the Galaxy Hitchhiker Guide was D.B.Cooper.
I thought only data was stored in the cloud.
Oh Captain, my captain, if you could just pull over here for a minute.
Well, at least it isn't a bird strike.
We often see this when we pass Cloud 9.
At least he’s not a jailbird.
We can stop for Paul Kantner can't we.
That's some serious dead-heading right there.
Don't stop. I can see her boyfriend behind the cloud.
Hey you, get off of that cloud...Oh that's Mick.
Does he know it's surge pricing right now?
He likes our plane.
Odd. Generally, people hitchhiker TO Cloud Nine, not away from it.
You just never know what you're going to find that's been uploaded to the cloud.
After Trump was elected, I'm not surprised by anything I see.
*stairway to heaven still under construction*
So sorry, we only stop at cloud nine
I've heard about this. They're calling it, high hitchjacking.
That's how you become a statistic.
Too bad we have a full flight.
I would, but he looks a little high.
If we stop to give him a lift, we'll lose ours!
Maybe we better just stick with gas or grass this time around.
Do you think he went through security with that backpack?
I guess they went ahead and put standby in the cloud.
Officer, I can promise you I am not high.
i’d prefer uber but i guess this will do
Another one! I thought cloud storage was virtual.
Don't stop. It could be a serial aberration.
They really went for it when they called this cloud 9.
Another one who just got kicked out of heaven!
I'd stop, but that bag won't fit in the overhead bins.
Nothing unusual ever happens to me.
Pretend that you don't see him. He's obviously high on something.
I could have sworn I just saw Jack Kerouac.
High. On every level.
Don't do it, Carl. You know it's not safe to pick up hitchhikers.
Immigrants and dreamers on cloud 9 are still not getting in...per Trump.
Does he mean, "up, up, away we go?"
He gets around. I saw him three weeks ago high above Australia.
Suppose we pick him up and it turns out he’s undocumented. Then what ?
It’s too risky to pick up a hitchhiker that is carrying a parachute.
Now we know why they never found D.B. Cooper.
I spy with my little eye
must have been a misprint in his Hitchhiker's Guide...
See, I told you he died in the last movie.
Ignore him, it's just DB Cooper again.
Don't stop! He probably has a pen!
That's not a valid iCloud stopover.
He is going to Washington DC
Guess he really thought that his future was in the 'cloud'.
Hi, Jack
I hate flying into SFO
Wait. Didn't we pass that guy on the last cloud?
Either we're trapped inside an episode of the Twilight Zone, or we're about to hit a mountain.
If we go to reverse thrust you can step out and pick him up.
Well, I heard he got high, but this is ridiculous.
Forget it. No way that thing fits into overhead.
Captain. I believe it’s the guy on cloud nine.
Don't pick him up he hasn't been through tsa
Hey Bob. Isn't that the guy who wrote "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe" ?
Well, we are called "Spirit Airlines."
I thought we left Woodstock?
Steve Bannon.
I think perhaps he took "Hitchhikers' Guide to the Universe" a bit too literally.
Downloading your stuff from the cloud is not always so easy.
Don't stop. That duffle bag won't fit in an overhead bin.
That’s some drone.
I don’t know how he expects anyone to pick him up when he’s so obviously high!
I feel guilty every time I see him.
I guess he didn’t want to pay the baggage fee.
These Tesla customers are really taking the piss now
I guess he's tired of being on Cloud 9.
that guy is always on the same cloud!
We must be close to Seattle.
He got this far. He can get himself home.
I think that's D.B. Cooper.
“He&s what’s left of flower power.0
Is that Cosmic Ray? He is not traveling faster than the speed of light after all!
Where's the Tesla?
Sorry, this plane is not in service.
During the 60’s I would have picked him up.
Andy on Westbound stated that he wouldn't let them screen his backpack.
No one's had an extra empty seat since deregulation in '78
Who knew - a cloud-based virtual-data guru needs an actual lift!
Might as well pick him up since we don’t go to Atlanta anymore.
What a nimbus!
Hey Hey. I told you to tell him to get offa my cloud.
No luck on the roads, these days
Finally we can see eye to eye
First it was every street corner, now it's every cloud. Where are the damn Air Panhandler Control officers when you need them?
He must have Global Entry.
We'd better not pick him up, he could be trying to escape Heaven, and we might experience a lightning strike.
"Talk about sucking in a bird...".
Don't stop. That guy's high as a kite!
No towel... Amateur
Huh, so that's what happened to D. B. Cooper.
That could be John Lilly, the Special K guy.
Anybody we can bump?
That cloud commuting is really taking off.
This cloud storage thing doesn't seem to be as convenient as they make it out to be.
TJ Cooper, imagine that!
Now that marajuana is legal in Colorado, every time we fly over the Rocky Mountains, people who smoke it are getting higher & higher!
How high do you think that hippy is?
Breaks my heart to see what happened to air traffic controllers who went on strike.
Is this the Northbound?
“Yeah, but there is no place to pull over”.
You flash him the peace sign, I'll flip him the bird. By the time he figures out what's up, we'll be way the hell outta here.
"Forget it. I've seen this movie.
He's the guy who's trying to go from Cloud 2 to Cloud 9, but they'll never let him in.
Isn’t that the big air dude!
Legalized pot, another one high.
Hey, those brownies we had before take off... Where did you say they came from?
Whos food do you think is better his, or ours?
Cloud nine-thousand?
We just crossed into California.
Well now that's just plane stupid.
Let's give him a free ride, but it's $25 to check his bag.
No, different guy.
Ignore it. We're behind schedule!
Leave him, he looks high.
That reminds me. How'd that son of yours who invested in Bitcoin do?
Sorry, this is a non-stop flight. Try the next one.
Talk about "high".
Whos food do you think is better his, or ours?
We'll just airlift him through security.
Back in coach would be OK, I guess.
Sorry but we are in a bit of a hurry! Try us again tomorrow!!!
My mother warned me about picking up hitch hikers.
Better not stop, Cap'n. Economy is totally packed tight, like sardines. There IS one seat available in First Class , but, if we gave him that seat, we'd have a small riot on our hands.
Nah, it's just one of those high altitude parachute jumpers showing off.
Sully, your fans really do follow you everywhere.
Another high hitchhiker. There's something going on. Think we ought to report it?
Shall we save him to the cloud?
Hey Mr. Musk! Got room for one more?
Looks like D. B. Cooper has had a change of heart.
20 years ago, I wouldn't have hesitated, but today you just don't know who you can trust.
I always wondered what happened to that guy from 'The Hitchhiker'.
I don't know. Do we really want to take on another airline's problem?
Isn’t that the young Musk boy?
I really wanted this flight to go off without a hitch.
I store all my photos in the cloud now,and that's my son Rob.
Wonder what he's paying for cloud services.
Maybe he'll kick in for gas.
Don't hang around, baby, twos a crowd.
I thought "The Hitch-hiker's Guide To The Galaxy" was fiction.
United's new policy for unruly passengers seems a bit harsh.
Seen him before. He never gets further than Cloud 6.
Let's pick him up, he's TSA Pre,
Don't pull over. He's doing fine on cloud nine.
What did you say was in that coffee?
I hope he has his towel.
This is your captain speaking...We are currently flying over Colorado. If you look out to your left, you will see the Rocky Mountains and one really high hitchhiker.
Yes,I know I'm profiling. I just don't like his looks. And you know dam well the backpack hasn't been screened.
Wasn't he here last week?
What would Jesus do? ... Wait, maybe that is Jesus!
Can I hitch a ride?
I blame Elon Musk
I'd stop but we're out of seats.
No, he's not Douglas Adams. Looks a bit sketchy to me, Captain. Think we should pass on this one.
Hitchhiking. Really a lost art
Be seeing you real soon.
‘I’m pretty sure he’s looking for the Jefferson Airplane.’
Are you overbooked?
Just more Arthur Dent cosplay.
Yeah, I remember that Stones song. Why do you ask?
Looks like another fallen angel trying to catch a lift back to hell on earth.
Just for the record, do you ever feel we don't get enough oxygen in the cockpit?
Don't stop. It's dangerous here.
Call me a Luddite, but I just don't think uploading yourself to the cloud is safe.
LIMERICK: It seems to be more than a craze...We use it in so many ways... It goes without saying, technology's amazing...Everything's on the cloud now a days.
That must be how it feels to fly.
As long as nobody finds out what we see up here, we can keep our jobs.
I guess we can.. he doesn't LOOK like an NRA member.
Better not, think he's high.
Pre-check is getting out of control.
Don't bother. He never chips in for gas.
I wouldn't stop. He looks really high.
Tell him we're sorry, this is a nonstop flight.
eight more to go . . .
That dude's high.
If he's here on the way back, we'll pick him up.
"Someone sent him to the cloud via their computer and now he wants a free ride!
He's a little out of our wheelhouse.
Hasn't been the same since the Amtrak cutbacks.
He doesn't look like he can pay for jet fuel.
Looks like Kerosk is back!
Don't stop. He looks suspicious.
I think he was pretty high on the no fly list.
Wait ‘til you see the guy on cloud nine-er.
Looks like St. Peter took early retirement!
If you see the hitchhiker, that means we landed.
Sorry, we are only seating those on clouds one through eight. We will be with those on cloud nine shortly.
Well the algorithms did also predict Hillary would win.
Hey, isn't that the former secretary of transportation?
Another depressed soul looking for Cloud Nine.
If he is still there on our return leg - we could offer him a middle seat in back.
His seat was commandeered by a crew member two days ago.
Is that the ‘cloud’ all the kids are talking about?
That guy has got his head in the clouds.
This always happens during fleet week.
That's the guy that said he didn't get enough cashews in his bag
He just wants to get higher.
Looks like Cloud Nine was not his Cup of Tea.
Highjacking with a hitch, that's a new one.
The legalization measure must have passed.
Damn altimeter is off - we are higher than we thought
Another Rod Serling casting call.
Can you give me a ride to heaven?
Well, I think that solves the D.B. Cooper mystery.
Whoa, there really is a cloud nine!
What some people would do to skip the security lines.
Sure, pal, good luck hitching a ride with a bag that exceeds the maximum carry-on size.
Man alive, it seems like there’s a housing crisis just about everywhere these days.
Hey! You! Get me off of my cloud?
If we had an open seat, we would have cancelled the flight.
Must be the low frills cloud based naivigation
This, ‘childhood with a comb-over father’, series, really explifies why white males still could be, nay deserve to be, the central figure of new art.
The Coachella lineup must be really strong this year.
How did he get past TSA?
It’s another Air Hiker, WE ONLY TAKE VISA, sir
Tell him first class isn't going to Houston.
He's probably high.
Looks like he had a rough stay on Cloud Nine.
I heard the airline retired him mid-flight.
They say he used to fly for Pan Am.
who did you say baked those brownies?
Yeah, I heard Amazon is now offering cloud commuting.
...but what if he's carrying over 100mls of liquid?
Looks like Silicon Valley finally started putting people in the cloud.
He's trying to get back to Atlanta.
leave him be he'll be home in a few steps
Your son? What a coincidence.
I find it hard to stop for hitchhikers.
Guess he didn't build his wall high enough ?
That acid you gave me in Bangkok may be kicking in.
Do you think this might be your last flight Pops?
I think I'd better cut down on the Dexedrine for these long flights, Bob.
This airline has a brutal stand-by policy
I hope he doesn’t think that he’ll get overhead space for free.
should we stop over at the Bermuda?
What's the airline's policy on picking up deadheads?
Maybe we can pick him up on the flight back.
We're at capacity, let's hope that dummy in the Tesla picks him up.
Sorry buddy, this flight's oversold.
He needs to cutback on the recreational drugs.
It looks like Darwin was right. Even angels evolve.
OMG that's D. B. Cooper!
No sign, no dog on rope, no stopping, them's the rules.
Think he has TSA Pre-Check?
With all of these snowbanks and pedestrians around, are you sure this is the runway?
It's okay; you're over the run way for greater America!
That dude’s gotta be high on somethin’...
Good man. He just retrieved his data.
They've been saying Cloud 9 ain't what it used to be.
Security says it’s ok since it looks like he removed his shoes.
I heard Heaven wasn’t as much fun as they say.
Nowadays everything is in the cloud.
hitch hiking on 4/20
Do we have room for another non-rev?
He doesn't strike me as the kind of person who would need a ride
Well, that explains the whole D.B. Cooper thing.
How long has Ozzy Osborne been dead?
Again ! I wish he would pick a cloud and stay there.
He must really admire our flying skills. He came a long way to give us a thumbs-up!
Don't stop for him, he looks high.
He's woking on an update to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.
Well, looks like he's finally had enough of cloud nine.
The only way my kids will think this story is cool is if I tell them his backpack had a poop emoji on it.
Doesn't he know that hitchhikers are only allowed on the galaxy route?
I just don't think it's safe to stop here.
That's our new economy class.
Jeez, Arthur Dent has really fallen.
I’d feel guilty if he wasn’t going the other way.
We're not going to the galaxy, right?
Don't even THINK about it, Sullenberger. Sir.
Angels, I have heard they’re high.
Give me a break. I've seen him in first class at least three times.
We always see these heaven rejects.
By any chance, are you going to Pittsburg?
It is so sad that refugees have to do such dangerous things to escape.
No one stays on Cloud Nine for long.
Don’t make me cite company policy. Remember what happened last time?
Tell him to take a hike.
Ask the stewardess if William Shatner is on board ?
I'd pick him up if I thought he'd have my data.
Wish i knew what he was on.
Cloud 9 is unavailable
I wouldn't pick him up, he's definitely high.
Fine, but he’all have to sit in economy
Another Rapture wannabe.
OMG this totally reminds me of that summer between Freshman and Sophomore year...
Too risky.
One day you’re a bit-coin millionaire ... next day you’re a gray cloud pedestrian.
I still don’t get how The Cloud works...?
I’d like to give him a lift, but he’d never fit that bag into the overhead.
These guys will do anything to skip the TSA line.
Now, HIS head is in the clouds!
Well, guess that's what happens when you don't ante up for Spirit's destination fee.
So that's what a thumberstorm looks like
Maybe he's tired of looking at clouds from both sides now.
Gee, what do you think that guy is standing on?
Hey! I can pay you for the ride. It's me D. B. Cooper.
Sorry Sully, that's one soul you can't save.
The Stones must be touring again.
I guess Cloud 9 isn't what it used to be.
No way that bag would fit in the overhead bin.
In the old days it was, "hitch one's wagon to a star"
His miles expired.
Well Captain Sully, what do we do about this one?
Oh, that guy's on cloud nine again.
WE could drop him off at the next exit.
Oh, we see them quite often. Poor souls make it to the gates, but don't make the cut. Got a long fall ahead of them and hoping for a lift.
He seems high. Let's not stop.
He’s been that way ever since his Mod flunked Crirical Design Review
Not him. He never stops talking.
So that’s where D. B. Cooper landed.
Attention passengers, please avert your eyes, we are passing Cloud Nein
I hear he was dropped off here after someone checked the no fly list
You think there's any chance he just likes our airplane?
We shouldn't give him anything. He'll probably just buy drugs with it.
I think that's illegal...
How many boarding groups are there now?
‘Don’t stop, we have a full load.”
Hey! It's D.B. Cooper. Should we give him a ride?
Are we really that high?
Look at that! And I thought they were given their own wings?
Poor guy.....if he's still there on the next pass we'll pick him up.
That's the same guy we saw back on Cloud 9.
Yeez, thumbs up does take you places!
Don't stop, he's on the left wing side, it's not of our business, only people on the right side are allowed to fly! We could get fired for breaking the company's rule! And the president is a bit touchy on this...
I imagine he wants to get higher than we'll be going.
That guy looks really high, and this "everything is in the cloud" stuff is really out of control.
Heaven Control directs us to runway J as in John, Three Sixteen-er.
I've noticed more of this with the legalization of marijuana.
We must be flying over California.
Super high hiker
Looks like he took the high road.
Can I get an upgrade?
Keep going. He probably wants a ride for the peanuts.
Hey Bob, what's that mountain climber doing on top of that cloud?
We shouldn’t pick him up. That guy is as high as a kite.
Nah, I don't think so. I picked up a guy that looked like him last week and he reeked of jet fuel.
Can you help a fella out? Due to a TSA snafu, I'm stuck in limbo.
Nice to see Douglas Adams again --
Maybe he has the guide to the galaxy.....
Here's Another Hi(gh) HitchHiker Hank...
Welcome to Cloud 9
TSA is getting kind of lax over California.
Wow, old hippie, still hitchhiking!
Gives a new meaning to Fly the Friendly Skies, doesn't it?
'Well, we're definitely not in Kansas anymore.'
If we pick him up will we be slapped with a sexual harassment suit?
C.G.I. has come a long way.
These flying dreams are getting more and more bizarre.
I've heard of mountain goats in cumulus clouds, but never a mountain man!
It's never a good idea to pick up hitchhikers when they're high.
Whatta ya know? I guess you can get too high.
I thought you said we were over Sacramento? This looks more like San Francisco.
Five bucks says he’s got that guide to the galaxy in his backpack.
I heard about this on Rush!
He's been on cloud 9 since 1968.
He must have missed the bus.
I don’t see it if you don’t see it.
Looks like that hitchhiker’s a little high.
Can I hitch a ride to the stairway to heaven?
It's great to get a thumbs up at this altitude.
That guy still here?
Hey, its Woody.
We're good to go. He's going to hop onto the twilight zone flight behind us.
This is some transient weather pattern.
Looks like we missed the Rapture.
Smile, we're getting a thumb's up.
Nope, the backpack won't fit in the overhead storage bin.
Not only have they legalized it, they've made it more potent.
Talk about airheads...
Time warp...I think we are in the '60s.
Hitchhikers these days.
...just another "fly-by-night" if I ever saw one!
Someone should tell him his thumb is the wrong way
He should have taken the voucher.
Cloud 9 is not all that great I want out............
He'll still have to pay $25 to check the backpack.
He must be high if he thinks we’re going to pick him up.
Ralph, some days it's a good thing you're blind.
Economy seating ain't what it used to be.
Shirley he doesn’t think we could vector that cloud.
Hey! Dude! Get off of my cloud!
Sulley and crew are confused. "Is that really D.B. Copper? Arthur Dent?" Fact or fiction?
Last time we gave that guy a ride all he did was preach.
Do you think he called an Uber?
Occasionally, visitors to the National Air and Space Museum like to pretend that they are hitchhiking in the sky.
Yeah, we should pick him up; we could use the gas money.
Looks like the stairway to heaven is broken again
Culture shock? Nah. He won’t have any idea we’re in the 2000s.
I'd love to stop for the guy but our overhead compartments are full.
And here's Cloud 9. Hey, was that you when you met Mom?
Don't stop. We must be near a prison.
Don't stop the plane, Tom. He looks like he is high on something.
I would like to see the guy who got him up on cloud 9 in the first place...
So that's where the hitchhikers went
We'll pick him up on the way back!
Far out, man.
Sorry. We're only going as far as Pittsburgh.
Don't stop for him. Our economy class is already filled.
Who’s Rod Serling?!
Guess someone once told him “It’s my way or the high way.”
I'm done pickin' up hitch-hikers here. Any time I ask 'em a question, they all say the same thing: 42.
He’ll be Ok. He’s just channeling Douglas Adams.
If it’s not Douglas Adams, then who is it?
He always misses his bus.
I’ve never been this high in my life.
No kidding! They’re making it uber to redeem those miles these days.
We always get Elvis sightings on this run.
We only have spare seats in first class, keep going.
I guess he’s finished polishing the silver linings.
Hey why not? Let's give Timothy O'Leary a ride.
Forget, Cap; the last guy I picked up stank up the whole cabin.
I don't know what's happened to him. He used to be so down-to-earth.
I guess he's out of cloud storage.
Let's stop. He might have gas money.
He seems safe enough, but I hate to pull over in all this air traffic.
Nah, it can't be my brother; he doesn't play guitar.
Too bad. There are plenty of seats, but there's no space left in the overhead bins for his hand luggage.
Absolutely not! We're no longer taxiing.
And they say upward mobility is on the decline!
I would not stop even if it were J C.
I hope he clears the wing.
hey, pull over!
Rodger, I don't know captain, my mother told me to never talk to strangers, over.
They should have stopped trying to save money and pursed a through ticket.
Oh great, he saw you looking at him.
keep moving forward. it's all in the past.
I guess D. B. Cooper's parachute never deployed.
He made it this far, he can make it the rest of the way.
Roger, Denver. We're definitely not over Kansas anymore.
Go 'round, cap'n. I think that's D. B.!
Don’t stop. We’ve got a full flight as it is.
We can’t pick him up. He’s standing on the wrong side of the flight path.
He's been there ever since they published "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
Your brush strokes need work
Wow Sully, even the angels are homeless.
You've read what the manual says about Skyjacking, ignore him.
Some people just don't understand the Cloud.
TSA Pre-check
If he's your guardian angel, maybe I should take the controls.
I would, but there’s not enough aerospace.
Can I get a lift to Cloud Nine?
Let it go. The next Tesla will get him.
Ignore cloud 9.
You know the drill. 'No UFO Jokes'
I don't know, I've heard those cloud-based hitchhikers carry viruses.
Dunno if it’s the LSD or the Whiskey, but I think I’m seeing things!
I know it's distracting, but the Purgatory route saves us two hours.
We can't - he didn't make it past the TSA agents.
That’s Bob. He traded in his harp for a guitar in the 60’s. He was good. But not good enough.
you know, this 'cloud' business has gone WAY too far
That obsteperous guy we tossed out on Monday - still out there.
That s it! No more acid
I said hey,hey you,you get offa my cloud!
Hitchhikers have high hopes.
The only safe place to hitchhike, I suppose.
That’s my brother-in-law. I’d keep driving unless you want to hear about gravity being a government conspiracy.
So sad. I remember when angels had wings and did their own flying.
Okay, but he'll have to check the bag.
They call it cloud commuting.
Wasn't he selling flowers the last time we flew this route?
I saw him outside the last rest stop.
That must be cloud nine.
Just ignore him. He could fly if he wanted to.
"Attention passengers, out of your left window you will see purgatory".
We apologize, but the doors at the gate have already closed.
It's probably just a weather balloon.
Don't pick him up.He looks like hes high.
I didn't know we could throw them off anywhere.
Uh uh. I never stop for someone I don't know.
Cloud nine is never what they imagined.
That Nobel really went to his head.
I don't think so…we're full-up back in economy
Yea, that guy stores everything on the "Cloud"
Sorry, we boarded two hours ago.
I never pick up a cloud hitchhacker
He must have just grabbed a few things from the cloud.
Just ignore him. He's been around the Galaxy a few too many times.
Is this some sort of test?
I am so very frustrated with the current state of affairs.
We're not stopping. He's obviously high.
I It's just the Microsoft nerd.
No more towers? Air traffic controllers are on the cloud?
I think that's Steve Jobs ... on the Google cloud!
Should we stop?
Pay no attention. It’s a hologram.
Think he misunderstood ...he's using the cloud for back"packing" up!
No can do. We're banking south shortly.
Need ride to the Galaxy?
Oversized backpack.
It looks like someone missed his shuttle.
Huston: it looks like were going to be the first country to send a man to space on a marshmallow cloud!
It's the 60s all over again.
Cloud 9 is fine when you finish your thesis, but you still need a job.
These skies aren't what they used to be
Don't stop. He never chips in for fuel.
Looks like that guy aligns with the left wing.
And I thought drones were annoying.
I say we keep going. The guy is obviously high.
I've got two tickets to paradise, won't you pack your bags and we'll leave tonight
Naw. He's on his way to heaven. We're goin' the other way.
...and on your left you'll see D.B. Cooper still trying to bitch a ride.
We just might get a sequel out of this, Sully.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain, we're cruising at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Don't be alarmed if you see strange creatures out the windows. If any manage to get on the wings we'll do our best to shake them off.
It looks like Cloud Nine isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Buddy Christ, always looking for a ride
Sorry buddy, we’ve got a full plane.
There he is again on Cloud 9.
He's been heading for Haight-Ashbury since ‘67.
The other passengers won't mind if we stop... right?
Between the devil and the deep sea choose one .
“Get a job”.
Guess he's never heard Gordon Lightfoot's Early Morning Rain.
I would stop, but I gave up hitchhikers for Lent.
"Should we pick him up"?
It’s not as disturbing as that Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner.
Think I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.
Am I having your LSD flashback?
Don't stop, probably a hijacker.
I guess Elon's battery ran dry.
He looks suspicious to me.
Looks like we’ve got another SpaceX breakdown.
He's never going to get a ride dressed like that.
Don't pick him up. He's too high.
Look no more stops. I already let you out to use the bathroom.
Another downside to legalized marijuana!
I am beginning to think that a career with Greyhound Airlines was a mistake.
Pick him up, but he’s gotta’ check that bag.
No way! It would undermine our entire business model.
It looks like his carry-on might be too big.
He's always trying to get to cloud 9.
I was on my way to San Francisco. But now my plans are up in the air.
Oi! Phish still sucks rooster wattle! This here's the CRAZY PLANE!!!
Ignore him. He has to go through check in, just like everyone else.
Forget it, Sully. One miracle is enough.
Let’s not stop, he’d probably try to pay with SkyMiles.
Don't stop, I'm sure It's a hologram test from the TSA.
"He's probably on a pilgrimage to his data".
Trust me, he's no angel.
This is why we're always late getting into Laguardia.
I'm not liking TSA Post.
“Ascension is a cool thing but it has its limits”.
Chet, you gotta quit rigging your urine tests.
Maybe we should increase our altitude just a little.
That does it. We both saw him and we both ate the same meal. No more airline food for me!
Didn't we pass that guy over St. Louis? He must've bummed a ride.
The checklist is clear on this, Sully. No hitchhikers in a forced landing.
Cannabis is legal down there.
This wasn't covered in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
We've just identified a UFO.
Yeah well prohibition wasn't working so well either
Keep going. I can tell he's high.
Maybe if he'd jettisoned the guitar.
Roswell, this is XRAYTANGO. Is Area 53 looking for a missing hitch hiker? Over.
Definitely, a UFO.
‘’ I think I just saw Howard Hughes.’’
Don't stop. He may have escaped from a nearby prison.
Definitely a High jacker
Some angels find heaven tiresome.
As long as it's not a mountain goat.
Huh, so maybe the brown acid was okay after all.
Flying over Colorado has been interesting since they legalized pot.
Do my eyes deceive me, or are ripped jeans back in style?
You say your mother made those brownies?
Temptations. Cloud Nine. 1969.
The real question is how he got there.
sign to him : sorry, we've got a full flight
Anywhere on Earth!
Oh, Paul, we used to do that back in the 70s.
Let's stop.
pretend you don't see him
We thought he wanted to get a "loft."
Looks like he's seen that rough weather.
Isn't that the guy who wrote 'God Is My Co-Pilot'?
Ya know, that could be God.
Maybe he doesn't know this is a non-stop flight.
I've never heard of the "Woodstock Triangle". Why do you ask?
He looks high to me.
I liked Supergirl better.
He can stand on a cloud but still needs a ride from us?
Thankfully, we aren't going where you are.
Well what do you know - Peter Fonda - the Easy Rider is still standing on Cloud 9.
What a long, strange trip he's had!
Cooper's lookin' pretty good for his age.
First time I've ever seen the guy up here without his "GALAXY?" placard.
He's probly on his way over to Cloud 9
He used up his iCloud
Another one on cloud eight. So close, yet so far.
Hey, that's the same guy who was here yesterday.
We're sorry, but the door has closed.
My miles got me to somewhere over Omaha, and I've been thumbing rides ever since.
Jesus Christ ! ....... he's hitch hiking.
Do you think his Tesla battery died?
Now that is what I call a real California High.
Check the procedure manual
There is no more room in the head-room compartment for his back pack.
Remember, no hitchhikers above 10,000 feet, except for angels.
He's still trying to get to Woodstock.
I thought that show was fiction.
According to Cloud Man, we fly good!
We can pick him up on the way back.
Don't stop! That is how every horror movie begins!
First drones ....now whatever the hell that is.
Just another lost soul finding his way to ChoirInvisable Fest
Yes to the wing, no to the prayer.
I think thumbs up means he just wants to get higher.
Don't stop. Bees in disguise won't fool me this time.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Troposphere
...I don't know but my Mom always told me not to pick up hitchhiker's.
Keep going...He's standing on cloud eight. We're only allowed to pick up people on the next cloud.
Should we give him a lift?
Hi. I'm Doug. Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life.
There's a guy whose travel plans are really up in the air.
Hitchhiker at nine o'clock.
No, we don't give a ride to anyone floating on Cloud Nine!
Well I'd like to, but I don't think he could afford the checked baggage fee.
Basic Coach?
No, that's cloud 8.
I wouldn't pick him up. He looks high.
How does he expect us to stop?
Like we're gonna stop to pick him up.
He’s got a problem? Aren’t clouds like that often seen on mountain peaks?
I wouldn't do it. Last time we picked one up, he drank all the booze in First Class, and then wanted to be dropped off over JFK.
LAX. We have a hitchhiker.
We'll pick you up but that bag will need to be checked
Too bad we're full.
OK. But one more and I'm converting!
Hay, that's the same guy i saw hitch-hiking out of Woodstock !
There’s another one in the cloud.
This is Delta Flight 2020. We just had a spotting of Wayne LaPierre of the NRA.
Nah, let him buy a Stairway to Heaven.
That dude's high.
We’re so buzzed. You think he could fly this sucker?
Didn't we pass that guy 3,000 miles ago?
On your left, you can see a guardian angel sky-hitching to his next assignment.
Could you check the oxygen level in the cockpit?
Do you think he has a guide to the galaxy?
Ignore him ...we're overbooked .
Keep flying - I can just tell that he won't let us check that bag.
Those new Air Jordans are amazing but he should drop down to 31,000 to catch anything going east.
He thinks our next destination is Cloud 9!
Sorry, this flight is overbooked.
A thumb drive in the cloud? I don't stop for mixed metaphors.
The Rolling Stones aren’t going to like it...
Don't stop for him. He doesn't have his towel.
Ya, sure, he's probably got three more hiding in the clouds.
I don't see anything.
Ignore it. It's just the caffeine talking...
Well...We are the Friendly Skies.
Next time you take the red acid and I'll take the blue.
Keep going. The last thing he needs is a lift.
We may want to rethink replacing the airline peanuts with those mushrooms.
It must be an angel in disguise
He got stranded when Congress cut NASA's budget
He's gonna wait a long time for a plane with an empty seat.
Not to worry. It's just my youth in the cloud
That must have been some wacky weed!
He gets angry when we tell him we can't detour to heaven.
So what exactly was in your brownies?
Can't. We're flying nonstop.
The last one I stopped for had his head in the clouds.
He'll probably expect us to honor his transfer.
I’m not sure moving ticketing to the Cloud was such a good idea.
Wow, that guy must REALLY high!
Last time, he wanted to fly to Sheboygan. We don't go to Sheboygan!
O.K., one of us is really high!
What was I supposed to do? He wouldn't put the cigarette out.
Flight 213 to Tower. We have another forcibly-removed passenger from Flight 344 in sight.
He is really high. Let’s mess with him.
That might be the real reason we seem to have fewer passengers.
Must be headed down to Austin
If he says his destination is the pearly gates, keep going.
I’ve gotten t good news and bad news.
Security was a breeze
I’ve got good news and bad news.
I’d pick him up but we’re already behind schedule.
We really need to rethink our "we stop anywhere, any time" slogan.
Guess that's as far as that guy who wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has gotten.
Just another aging hippie on a high
Looks like Charles Manson didn't get in.
He’s hitchhiking on the highway to heaven.
Where did you get those cookies?
THIS IS FOR THE MUSEUM DRAWING, I JUST MISSED THE DEADLINE "Ceci n'est pas une pipe!"
Don’t pick him up, he looks like DB Cooper
I didn't know the train had stopped running.
Please help. I aimed too high and now need help in steadying my feet to the ground.
Cloud nine is definitely not on our itinerary!
Uber’s next upgrade.
I guess it IS true, old hippies never die!
This is your copilot again, ladies and gentlemen. Although Mt Rainier isn't visible today, if you look out the Port side of the plane you might be able to spot D B Cooper!
The jet lag is getting to me again.
We have a seat, but he'll have to check his luggage.
Just pretend we didn't see him.
Against the law? I think that's against a lot of laws.
These hippies are getting too far into the clouds...
Captain, I think we might be too high.
That’s too much data in the cloud.
Grateful Dead groupie....
So that's what happened to Nick Nolte.
On behalf of the entire crew, we thank you for hitching a ride with us today.
guess the Angel gig is not as good as it used to be.
Pickup on Cloud Nine
Isn't that Arthur Dent from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
Nah,10,000 feet is our limit.
The FAA inspectors are popping up everywhere.
I don't think we should pick him up, he's pretty high.
Ho Hum, Another creationist themed cartoon from the New Yorker
Even God says thumbs up, Sully
Too bad he picked the wrong cloud.
If we take him on, somebody else is getting dragged off kicking and screaming and the video will be all over the Internet. Let’s do this.
Just toss him a few bucks and tell him to take the airbus.
Poor bastard. Retrieving stuff out of the cloud isn't as easy as they say.
I used to hitchhike a lot before planes.
Never pick up anyone if you can't see their feet.
Man, we could use somebody to chip in for jet fuel.
Now there’s thumb to nowhere!
I'd pick him up but the guitar case won't fit in the overhead bins.
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is in the cloud streaming.
Damned cloud hoboes!
He's almost there. That's cloud 8.
He obviously doesn't know that you can now purchase tickets through the cloud.
It looks like another passenger was bumped from an economy seat. Lesson learned, always fly first class.
What a drag we can't give him a lift.
He must be on a drug high.
I told him that carry on won't fit under the seat.
I passed a guy that looked just like that on my way down the mountain this morning. Hey, wait a minute....
He ought to know we only stop at cloud nine
Man, I feel for those United guys.
Don't pick him up - He is high!
All we have left is a middle seat next to the lavatory.
We would... but there’s a $25 baggage fee.
Fly by. The new NRA discount policy is for the birds.
and that's what you get when you offer 5GB of free cloud storage
I’m not stopping today. Last week he ate all the peanuts in the galley.
Well, okay, but there's no more discount for NRA hitchhikers ...
Yeh, he's always here.
We can't pick him up, we're all out of peanuts.
Oh! Look what we gave here, another bad ass rocker who’s changed his mind
I didn't think you could that high on opioids.
He is trying to get credit for the return flight
If he was dressed a little better I might.
That's my first hitchhiking yeti. How about you?
Wow, I haven't seen that since the '70s.
They come here looking for their data.
Need a lift-off?
Hmm. Guess i cloud didn’t work out.
Keep going! He looks to me like he's on Cloud Nine.
How'd he get through security?
Can you give me a lift to Cloud 9?
I was told the cloud would soon be everywhere, but......
I’m sick of all these sky-divers who are too lazy to fall all the way to the ground.
Say, isn’t that the dude that wrote “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy”?
Everybody wants a free ride these days.
Hey, isn't that Douglas Addams?
Douglas Adams must be writing again.
I'm not picking him up. He kinda looks like that sketch of DB Cooper.
I wouldn't stop for this one, he looks high.
Another one ran out of money before getting to the Pearly Gates.
I want what he's smoking.
He looks dangerous even with the wings.
And I thought that we were high.
I’ll radio the control tower that we just entered Colorado air space.
Same guy. Same cloud. What da ya think he’s packing?
Yep. Must've read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Do you think he's high?
That's definitely not cloud nine.
With oversold flights the whole standby thing sure has gotten crazy.
This guy's taken cloud surfing to a whole new level.
It’s definately getting harder to find an affordable non-stop flight.
'Hey! You! Get off of my cloud!'? Trite.
How much do we charge now for carry-on?
He's not heavy, he's my brother.
Another D.B. Cooper wannabe.
And to your left you'll see a misreading of height ash bury.
Yeah, he does look pretty high, I don't think we should pick him up.
Don't. We're in a prison area.
He's asking to download.
Never pick up a hitchhiker who is THAT high.
hey hey you get off of my cloud
Don't stop -- he might be high.
Isn’t that the guy who wrote The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy?
I guess not everything belongs in the cloud.
Yeah your right no way that bag will fit under the seat.
The rule is don't them up if they're high.
Looks like Starman wanted more vacation days.
Hmm, what planet does that guy live on?
It looks like United is now offering mid-flight ejections.
Cloud nine's not all it's cracked up to be.
Should we give him a lift?
Do you think he’ll report us to Customer Relations because we didn’t stop?
What is that hitchhiker doing way up here in the clouds?
We could charge him a luggage fee.
sorry, we are fully booked. wait for the next flight.
Yeah, I see him up here all the time. He's been high since the 60's.
Do you think he'll spring for gas?
What, you never read Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy?
Another one who read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
You know, I just don’t pick up high jackers anymore. It’s too risky.
You don’t need to stop. I don’t think he’s going to Newark.
Another sky hiker!
The press secretary did say poor people are coming up in the world.
that man's been through haven and back.
Of course the backpack would be extra
No way Larry - look at him. We'll have to stop at JFK!
Inform the flight crew, we're clear for landing.
So many unintended consequences from legalizing marijuana.
I swear those Rocky Mountains keep getting higher.
I'd like to help but there's no place to pull over!!
They're always wanting a lift to Cloud 9
Gas, grass, or ass; nobody rides for free.
...I would, but he just looks too high.
Don't stop. He'll bore you to death about the galaxy.
If you guys can help me out, I`ll give you a 4-hour life ticket, redeemable when you, go bye bye
That's my brother. I sent his photo to the cloud.
We do have room in coach class.
We only pick up those on cloud nine.
That must be Cloud 8.
Are you sure they don’t feel a thing?
Him again?! That's the hitchhiker guide to the universe.
Dude, can I hitch a ride to the next cloud?
Is he high?
He's really far out.
Can you give me a lift to my DeLorean?
He's on high. We just can't give him a lift.
Yes, I see him, too — we have to lay off those mushroom salads.
Lat time we picked him up he ate all the peanuts.
I'm not sure hitchhiking is the best way to reach cloud nine.
He is on a mission from God.
Don’t stop! I hate when they do not use a cardboard sign.
Is it wrong of me to assume he's high based on the hippie clothes?
Stop the plane! Looks like we finally found DB Cooper!
You're not gonna start telling me all about Woodstock again, are you Captain?
I don't really need any gas, grass, OR ass. How about you?
Looks like his cloud computing career never really took off.
STRANGE! I PASSED HIM ON THE ROAD TO THE AIRPORT THIS MORNING.!
Well, OK. But only if he’s TSA Pre.
Oh man, there's another one that got bumped mid-flight.
If he's not wearing wingtips, he will be soon.
I don't know. He looks like a drifter.
I mean, seat C23 IS unoccupied
Captain, could that be D.B.Cooper?
Even if we wanted to the flight is booked
I've picked those guys up before but they're just marketing "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Atmosphere".
Another guy lost his bitcoin in the cloud looking for a free ride home
That knapsack has to be an air guitar. Right?
poor chap ran out of frequent flyer miles somewhere over Miami
I took the $29 flight from Boston to LA.
I never could understand the drivers who picked me up when I was his age.
Isn't that the chap we dropped off last week?
He must be out of cloud storage.
Ryan Air Flight 66 on the port side
We are dreadfully sorry but we aren’t allowed to give anyone a lift, especially at these altitudes, better luck with the next plane!
Okay. Coast is clear.
Never mind. Were just one of those legal Marijuana states.
Doesn't he know it is against company policy to pick up hitchhikers.
Could that be Arthur Dent?
How do you suppose Adam made it down to earth?
Can't, it's against FAA regulations...
Is the Dali Lama on board?
Captain, I know picking up hitchikers is against FAA regulations, but I really like his vibe.
He came up on the Highway to Heaven.
Maybe we should give him a ride, he seems adrift.
Damn, Sully! Every nine or ten years there's some new hazard to get past as we lift off from La Guardia!
Going high way?
Hey buddy, who's to say you're not the one on display!?
I'm afraid that if we file a report on this sighting, it may be the last report we ever get to file.
He's only half-way through "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."
Don't we have room for one more standby?
Only if his baggage is under 50 pounds.
Should we tell him it’s 42?
He got bumped from the overbooked flight
Where do you think he’s headed?
Another one trying to hitch-hike home from the Willie Nelson concert...
I’ve had bad experience with the cloud
The world just keeps on evolving, huh Frank?
Funny, I didn’t think the End of the Galaxy would look quite like this!
Bags fly free, people don't
We must be on the Highway to Heaven
Purgatory rescue team
He can catch the Airbus five minutes behind us.
"I guess Tim's not having fun".
Going to Cloud Nine?
Far out!
Help me touch down and bring me 'round again!
Another one trying to escape the White house!
Wow, looks like Douglas Adams is still hitchhiking through the galaxy.
Got to hand it to him, going for a million air miles.
He'd do better if he used the other thumb.
See? I told you there was an Uber market everywhere.
I think it's that new passenger designation–Uber Class.
Hey, you guys going to Burning Man?
No Cloud 9 isn't all it's cracked up to be. No pun intended.
Get a haircut!
Uh, Tower. How much longer are we going to be in this holding pattern?
Isn't he the guy who wrote a guide to the galaxy?
Remind me to pass on your peyote snickerdoodle next time.
Make sure he’s TSA pre-checked
How many times are we just going to pass him, Carl?
Don't pick him up Captain - he looks as if he's high as a kite!
Check this dude is so high.
Must've bought a seat in 'trickle-down' economy class.
No, I don’t think we should pick him up. He’s as high as a kite.
Wow. I really don't know clouds at all.
Internet cloud service workers should provide their own transportation.
Okay, My Captain Escher, that guy's either a hitchhiking angel, or a dude standing in a snowbank.
And that, son, is why you never fly budget airlines.
Is he high, or are we?
You know company policy is no hitchhikers!
That man has taken hitchhiking to a new level.
Guess he got more out of "Cloud Atlas" than I did.
Don't Stop!" He hasn't passed cloud control.
Do you suppose we'll have to take him all the way up?
Strangest safety inspector I've ever seen.
Think we can stuff one more into our cheap seats?
He's too high to suffer range anxiety.
His Uber better get here soon.
My Way or the Highway!
I'd consider it, but that guy is clearly higher than a kite.
Don’t do it. He’s higher than a kite.
We have room for him but he would have to check that carry on.
I wouldn't pick that one up. He looks higher than a kite.
Looks like there's been another round of funding cuts at NASA.
I guess cloud 9 isn't for everyone.
I overheard the medical dispensaries in heaven were being shut down by the AG.
How weird is that guy?
Whenever I see him, I just pretend he's saying "good job!"
Turn! Turn! Turn! We don't want to hit that Byrd!
Okay, but only if he's signed up with our rewards program.
This guy must be high.
But we're not cleared for that airspace, Sir.
Last time I picked him up, he went on and on about how high he used to live on cloud nine.
This is too weird. We must be in The New Yorker Cartoon Contest.
It’s actually pretty common since Trump’s latest Travel Ban.
Looks like Musk forgot where he parked his Tesla again.
Is that what you do when your Cloud is full?
He is High as a kite Captain.
“Isn’t Timothy Leary dead”?
That's the ninth cloud he's been on.
I guess the Cloud has eliminated the last vestige of IBM's famed white shirts.
I won’t say anything, if you don’t.
Don't stop - we're right above a prison.
I don't think he's been cleared by TSA.
My brother-in-law was an end timer
He looks OK, but we probably shouldn't pick him up.
There goes another human I'll never meet!
No no, don't stop! He has a bunch of other guys hiding in the cloud!
Let's keep going. He looks high.
He must've booked Super Economy.
We're not falling for that again...
I think the trailing Spirit Air flight will give him a lift.
Do you think the Russians gave him a ride this far?
Didn't we see him on Twilight Zone?
He couldn’t make it smell any worse in here.
Don't stop, just tell him we changed our name to Jefferson Starship.
Someone needs to tell him his fly is down.
Co-pilot: Saint Peter sure has been having a rough time ever since that wall got built to keep the "bad hombres" out. Pilot: Yeah. I can't believe He got the Trump Administration to pay for it too.
Where does he think he's going?
He said “no thanks” when I said we had only middle sears left.
I didn't know this flightpath went through Limbo.
I didn't know Neil Young died, did you?
Better not, that bag’s too big for carry-on.
Bomb? No. I'm worried he's carrying a guitar.
Don't start this again. You know the last one didn't fit in the overhead bin.
It's a Rocky Mountain high. We're over Colorado.
Uber is taking it to the next level.
Captain, is there a navigational error? That's not Cloud Nine.
What's he been smokin'?
Wasn’t that D.B. Cooper ? No more rides for you buddy boy!
I picked him up in Witchita last year and he stole my phone charger.
Bob, I’m confused about uploading to the cloud.
Nice try anyway.
He's on cloud nine, on his way to disillusionment.
That's a local stop.
It's tough when the Pearly Gates aren't open to everyone and you've just got nowhere to go?
Don’t pick him up. He looks like a murderer.
Didn't your mother ever warn you about picking up a hitchhiker?
Spirit Airlines adheres to a strict no-late boarding policy.
Another self-flyer run amok.
Do you have your liquids in a plastic bag?
Frequent flyer...but today he'll have to wing it.
Don't stop - this is a dangerous stretch of sky.
Looks like Bob's still in limbo.
Looks like somebody's been squeezing the Charmin again.
No, the harp is too big for carry-on.
Whatever they're paying me, it's not enough.
I’ve read about this. Delta is a stickler, when it comes to using your frequent flyer miles.
Don't Stop. I think something bad might happen if we do.
You know, honestly, this is a secret fantasy I've held for years.
Don't stop for him, there's a prison below us.
I always wondered what happen to D.B Cooper.
He needs to download that app.
Sorry, we're completely booked.
'Are we ever going to be done with the frigging Boomers?'
My mom always told me never to stop for a hitch-hiker. She didn't care how well they were dressed.
They say he was hit by a car on his way to Woodstock.
Attention Passengers: Look out the window to your left and you will see the final stop on the Appalachian Trail.
He won't get off my cloud!
Getting into the I Cloud is easy but getting out has it’s drawbacks.
That extension of the Appalachian Trail has gone way too far.
don't stop. there are three other people hiding behind that cloud.
Oh look! a skydiver on the run
I wouldn't stop for him, captain. He definitely looks high.
What's that mountain climber doing in the......oh, no......
Man, I got that song stuck in my head - "Ride, Ride, Ride, Hitchin' a Ride."
Dude is flying higher than a kite.
WHAT?! I CANT HEAR YOU!
How high do you go? There is no time left, Putin made it clear last night.
I think he’s one of the characters in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
I know we have an empty seat in first class, but it's next to Pruitt.
Are my eyes playing tricks or did we just pass Arthur Dent?
Yesterday he was wearing a crown.
He must not have read the book.
"Should we tell him we are not heading to heaven but the other place"!!!
Must of had his NRA discount revoked
Told you we were lost, that's the second time we've seen that guy
He'll eat all our Slim Jims and won't chip in for gas.
He's trying to redeem miles
Yes, I have heard of cloud nine but never seen it before.
What do YOU think that cloud looks like?
Do you have any idea why he thinks we're headed in the same direction?
The smog is really getting thick these days.
How about that, there is a cloud nine!
I thinks that's cloud nine. He'll be fine.
I'm afraid to pick up anything from the Cloud.
Isn't that your brother Ralph?
Don't you always wonder how the knees get ripped out?
So, that's what is in the cloud.
He must be their poet.
Don’t stop, I think he’s high.
I guess everybody these days is obsessed with The Cloud.
I thought that there was something funny about those meal tray brownies
What would St. Christopher do?
It was just a matter of time before ride-sharing went to the cloud.
I could use the SkyMiles.
Don't stop! This could be the latest terrorist ploy!
You the man, Sully!
Cloud Niner to ground control, we got another one.
At least bags fly for free
I don't pick up hitch-hikers unless they are walking
Keep going, Jeff, all we have is first class.
I must be seeing things. A hitchhiking Zombie from "Night of the Living Dead"?
Did you see that guy? What a bum!
He must have missed the Vogon's plane.
Ignore him. We aren't allowed to pick up hitchhikers.
His shirt said HELP so it must have been at a Beatles concert.
I would, but he's got a carry-on.
United dragged another one off?
Nowadays everybody is a comedian.
A 'carry on' for the wayward son. Go figure.
It doesn't pay to argue with Low Costs mid-flight.
I don't our destination is his destination.
Life in the cloud is safe.
Jerry Garcia still hanging around, huh?
He is part of the new cloud based storage plan.
I don't care if he's a saint--I don't pick up hitchhikers.
For heaven's sake, another sky walker.
If it were my call Captain, he hasn't been thru baggage search
Hey I think I’m a little high but can I get a ride?
I guess he does not know that "The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Universe" is out of print.
I just don't get that Cloud technology.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
Elon Musk's latest space gambit?
Hey, do you remember that far side comic about what's a mountain goat doing way up here in a cloud bank...?
I don't think he's an archangel!
Must be one of those United passengers.
I thought you said it was safe to backup to the cloud? It doesn't look safe to me.
Seems the Stairway to Heaven didn't, in fact, go all the way up.
When did the airlines start taking away the seats?
Isn't that the same guy we passed over Canada ?
I'm looking for a lift to cloud nine.
Looks like he took the book way too literally.
Forget it Sully. He want a lift to the Hudson.
If God had intended man to stand in the clouds hitching rides, then he would have given us shoes with wings.
Too bad we don't have time to pick him up.
Why would anyone want to go to Newark?
THAT HAS TO BE AN ALL-TIME HIGH!
We got in bad trouble the last time we stopped
Remember the last guy we picked up? Never did get that smell out of coach.
Did you upload him to the cloud?
I'd stop, but the only open seats are in Basic Economy and he has a full-sized carry-on.
Is it Rod Serling?
I told you we shouldn't have turned the seat-belt sign off
Just one of those new emojis from the cloud.
Clear skies with chance of vagrancy.
I don't ever pick up hitchhikers on Cloud 9. They bum me out.
WOW! Talk about climate change!
I hate what they have done to frequent flyer programs.
Don’t look. There’s a fellow on a cloud trying to hitch a ride from us. One of those forgetting how to retrieve themselves from the cloud.
Some people take icloud so literal.
Hmmmm, too bad we're not going his direction.
I remember. You only stop for Patsy Cline and Tammy Wynette.
Don't make eye contact, Jim. Just pretend he's telling us we're doing a great job.
Does this mean we’re near a prison?
Remember when people used to just call a travel agent?
AMAZON has got me here to welcome you.
Ici, On peut voir une personne qui est dans des nuages. il est aussi haut que l'avion. Beaucoup de personnes n'utilise pas leur cerveau, mais il pense et il crée des opinions même s'ils sont différent de l'opinion du publique, et ca le monte.
My mother told me not to pick up hitchhikers.
We usually get that when we fly over Woodstock
He probably used up his frequent flyer miles.
,,,and off to your right you'll see cloud 8.
Roger McGuinn, hitch hiking, circa 1966.
Let's see...Nimbus, Stratus, Cumulus, Kerouac...
Isn’t that the same dude we saw way back on Cloud Eight?
Are you positive we did not crash?
Don't stop. We're already overbooked.
It makes you wonder when even Zeus hits on hard times.
I’d say considerably higher than a kite.
Well, the steering wheel was about this big, but the rest of the plane was smaller than yours.
It's called 'cloud commuting', sir.
Be careful, I think he is one of those new cloud niners!
Uh, Captain, is there any information about hitchhikers on clouds in the Flyer's Manual?
Wow, that is not what you see everyday!
Super Budget Economy Fare.
Standby?
Maybe he has the guide to the galaxy.....
Do you think we should notify TSA about his backpack?
He's trying to go to Cloud 9 but we're a low-cost...
‘That’s the third time this week.’
A real Zeppelin fan wouldn't need a lift.
My mother said never to pick up strangers.
They are letting anybody in these days
Don't let him on. You should never pick up hitchhikers.
I thought Woodstock was in the other direction.
That's the same cloud we dropped him on the way out.
Looks like we got another Dead Head.
What is the company policy regarding picking up cloud hikers?
It's Just A Mirage !
He wasn't able to use his NRA discount.
This guy wants an upgrade from Cloud Nine?
They call him the Hitch High King.
It ist just another of those "ex-Trumpians" of the 2010s, they all seem to have been kicked out by Saint Peter.
I thought we left that guy on cloud nine just last week!
Forget it. There is no way he has gone through security.
Rutger Hauer got old...
Don’t stop - I did once and regretted it.
Hey, my iCloud is full!
Shouldn't we look up the TSA regulations?
Hey is that cloud?
You are okay, this is a selfie safe zone!
How come I do not see the cartoons any longer? They do not appear in any of the three pages. Too bad. I really miss them.
I had a dream . it said heaven catch a ride. hell. just say (GOOD bye.)
Hello, pilots! It's working fine but I'm stuck!
Keep going, a budget airline will be through soon enough.
Is that the guy who wrote 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'?
Only if he went through TSA first.
Hey! I got stranded in the iCloud!
He still must pay the $50 per bag fee.
He'd better watch out for the wing...
Don’t pick him up, he looks really high!
Don't Panic. He's from Base 13.
Captain, is that Billy Ray Cirrus?" "Yeah, Rookie, it means you're too high.
Definitely higher than a kite!
He just wants to sell us his guide to the GALAXY
Those NRA boys lost it all!
Is that Major Tom?
Wish I could, but every time I stop for one we crash.
Looking good, boys!
I think you've been watching too many Twilight Zone episodes.
NO EYE CONTACT!
he’ll need to go on the standby list just like everyone else
We could charge him an extra $100 for flagging us down and $50 for the carry-on bag.
Come on, Dale, just ask this guy for directions so we can all get home already!
Wait for the local, we're non-stop.
Remember, Don't Make Eye Contact - - If you want to keep your licence
Don't stop. He's too ethereal."
Isn't he high enough?
Has our navigation system has autocorrected 'Vegas-bound' to 'vagabond' AGAIN?
If you're going to be a Trump dodger, would't going to Canada be waaaay easier?
Typical David Crosby-gets super high doesn't even arrange for a ride home!
Weather report stated it was a "cloudy" day not "crowdy".
Let him ride on the wing like that Twilight Zone episode
IT was right. Everybody is moving to the cloud these days
No way. Too scruffy.
He must've flown United.
And on your left: the ghost of D.B.Cooper.
He doesn't look like a Lucy.
Another hitchhiker from the galaxy who used up all his cloud storage
Because he's high and lazy he's thumbing a flight.
Poor Guy, It must be Purgatory out there!
Wow he looks really high!
I would have stopped to pick him up pre-9/11.
Should we stop? I don't know... Do you think God is testing us?
I always wondered if that was possible...........
Doesn't he look like that guy who played guitar with the Grateful Dead?
There’s another one looking for a ride to Cloud 9!
Another leftover from the sixties who got stuck looking for Lucy.
He's the author of the hitchhikers' guide to clouds.
Remember your training: don't make eye contact.
Well, showing here still counts as no-show in our company's policy, ok?
He's with that new super economy fare plan. Bags fly for free but passengers don't get to board.
He must have read A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Medical Marijuana Dispensaries in the Galaxy.
Is that Cloud 9?
The FAA says we're not supposed to pick up hitchhikers but if he's still here on the way back, let's do it.
Could I get a lift? I fell out of my Tesla Roadster on the way to Mars.
I should have pick him up at that dangerous intersection.
What zone do we put hitchhikers in?
Anyone going towards Cloud 9?
I always feel badly passing them by but ATC says this is a dangerous altitude
Looks like another lost soul.
That's the third one I've seen since they legalized it.
Fine, I'll pick him up. But do we charge him for the carry-on?
Just roll up the window and pretend you don't see him.
We could pick him up except there's no room in the overhead bins for the backpack.
Take him on and it might get us a nice write up in the airline magazine.
These half- fare tickets may not work out
Maybe it's the latest perk offered to you when you're bumped?
Didn't he see the tweet that Widespread Panic is taking a couple of months off?
He looks harmless enough. Let's give him a lift.
Just tell him, He is not on the Heavenly highway, but the road to Bloomingdales.
Ok, but he doesn't get any peanuts.
It's the result of breathing in large amounts of recycled air. Last week, two hours into the flight, I saw Peter, Paul and Mary.
It’s another one of those angels. Don’t be fooled just because he’s hiding his wings in a parachute bag.
Hey, is that the guy from the Martian movie?
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's a hitch hiker!!!
Good thing for her that Joni Mitchell never saw that!
He will probably be a aim in the ass.
FAA rules allow us to pick him up as long as he doesn't have over 3.4 oz of shampoo.
Geese are enough trouble, but now we have to watch for snowboarders?
At least he's got his cumulus wealth.
Who's D. B. Cooper?
You think we should stop.
Oh, THAT'S why the "PULL UP!" warning is going crazy.
I’ll let him in only if he forks over the $25 baggage fee
We'd have to check his backpack first.
Captain he’s flying higher than us!
He's not one of ours. Let him catch the next one.
No way! He could have more than 3.4 ounces of shampoo.
I guess cloud storage isn't for everyone.
No, I'm not going to pick him up, still, I hope it doesn't rain.
He should use the Lyft app.
There he is again. just too damned mean to buy a ticket.
I guess he missed the stairway to heaven. You know there's one in every cloud.
I'd stop to pick him up, but too many people would want to get off.
Hello from Russia. I just hacked my way into a cloud.
He wants to know if we are going to Cloud 9
That's a new high, even for Colorado.
Could you give me a lift? My cell phone took cloud computing to the highest level, then ditched me!
Don’t srop. He could be a hijacker
He Invented the cloud.
He must have Googled the wrong cloud
Looks like he forgot to bring his 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' with him.
All those years saying 'I need a miracle' outside of Grateful Dead concerts got him most of the way, I guess?
Don't look at him, Captain. NEVER, under ANY circumstances, make eye contact. For all you know, he could be an axe murderer!
Can you believe these freeloaders?!!
I can land this thing on a dime. But not on a cloud.
Now THAT'S no frills.
Another lost hitchhiker who forgot to pack his guide to the galaxy.
I never stop to pick up strangers.
We worries. He has the guidebook to the universe in his backpack.
The overhead bins are all full.
Oh that? It's the hitchhiker's guide to Cloud 9
Great...another Hell’s Angel wannabe.
You know, if he was carrying a guitar, I'd pick him up.
Now boarding cloud nine.
Looks like the Tesla Roadster ran out of juice.
Where to, Buddy?
God he's good looking! Have we dies and gone to heaven?
I don’t know Bob, he could have a severed head in that bag. Or worse: 3.5oz of any liquid, aerosol, gel, cream, or paste.
I haven't been that high in years! Let's pick him up, I want some of whatever he's taking.
Well I knew they had data in the cloud, but not hitchhikers too.
Even Hippies have evolved, they've learned to fly.
Looks like he's been hitchhiking to Heaven since Woodstock...
So - That is where you ended up Mr. Cooper!
I guess frequent flyer miles can only get you so far.
Yes Captain, picking up one passenger at the "terminal" terminal.
Well I was ABOUT to say this flight went off without a hitch ...
Don't forget what happened when they picked up Brad Pitt in 'Thelma And Louise.'"
Looks like 'low life' is taken literally in Heaven.
Hey, I need some lift.
Looks like he uploaded to the wrong cloud.
He works in the Cloud and always flys standby.
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
Sorry—Heaven is not on our flight path.
Sorry buddy. There's no room left in the overhead bins.
Does he know there's no place like home?
I’d stop and pick him up if I knew that his carry-on would fit in the overhead bin.
Eight Miles High
I'll fly away
Hey! You! Get off of that cloud.
After all, they did say our flight plan would be in the Cloud!
Yeah, flying Cloud Class doesn't guarantee them a place on a plane.
Freeloaders.
We should let him on, he’s priority standby.
It's called 'cloud commuting'.
Looks like he'll wing it...
I sense the cold, dead hand of Rod Serling somewhere nearby...
That Elon Musk is out of control
Did I leave the oven on?
Look there’s another one,...just sitting on cloud nine.
Of course I know how he got there -- he got kicked off a Delta flight for being an NRA member.
No, don't stop, we don't have anymore room in the overhead bins.
Glad he has a parachute...
Keep going. That bag will never fit in the overhead.
For once, I want a flight to go off without a hitch!
You don't recognize Luke Skywalker?
Help! I lost my way to Heaven
I thought everyone left Woodstock in a VW bus.
I think a new kind of cloud.... A cumulonitwit.
That hippie is higher than most.
Come on, guys - I finally got a date with her!
Goddammit, Mary Poppins, why don't you just migrate south instead of show up on MY cloud?
Now I finally understand my computer guy when he says it is "in the cloud!"
I guess he didn't have enough miles for an upgrade.
There's my old bass player.
Ignore him, it’s just another millennials thing.
I'd stop, but they won't let us bump paying passengers anymore.
Just wait until it rains
My mother told me not to.
That guy in Elon Musks' Tesla must have dropped him off.
That explains the broken down VW bus.
What a place to drop somebody off .
Oh yes, that's how we learned to fly back in my day.
Looks like Trump's pilot missed another runway.
Sometimes, I feel like my father who was a mere busker is looking down on me from above, happy I have a real job
I'm still not sold on this new air traffic control set up.
Gee, I didn't think he'd lost his airline credit card too.
We bumped the grouch so we do have an extra seat.
He's certainly high.
Need a lift?
Sorry, company policy: Don't pick up hitchhikers. There is a low budget airline behind us, they may be able to help you.
There’s the last guy on the waitlist.
Don't look at him! Don't look at him!
Corporate says OK, if he pays when we stop for gas.
He was going to Omaha.
Find a spot to pull over and I'll go set up the metal detector.
Peter must have picked his peck of prickled paupers...
He didn’t want to pay extra for leg room.
I guess putting your life in the cloud can leave you stranded.
What would Jesus do?
First cloud computing, now cloud commuting.
Don't encourage him, he thinks we'll give just anybody a ride.
Don't stop! It's D.B. Cooper.
No, don't stop. He's doing fine, that's could nine.
I'm gonna check twitter to see if Neil Young just died.
It won't fit under the seat in front of him.
I thought that went out with the 70’s
Looks like he lost his guide to the galaxy.
Vancouver, this is Virgin verifying visual on vapor vagabond. Honestly Ted, I didn't think the weirdest thing about this would be the alliteration.
He's probably just be updating his travel guide.
Those cable subscription guys are really getting desperate!
He's probably just be updating his travel guide.
Hey Phil, watch me cut this guy in half!
I didn't know he was working on a new travel guide.
Guess he's not doin' so fine...
Don't stop! He's just a free-loading travel guide writer.
Ya know, Scott, in the old days you knew you were flying over L.A. Now, it could be almost anywhere.
He got high on" Stairway to Heaven", & is trying to hitch a ride to a Led Zeppelin concert.
New rule says we can only pick up hitchhikers from cloud 9.
I usually pick up casual carpool riders before we take off.
I don’t know. Should we roll down a window?
Don’t talk to strangers
I can't believe you actually backed up to the cloud!
Legendary mind? He’s missed his astral plane again.
The (stuff or weed) they’re smoking these days is really over-hybridized? Or I’m seeing quite a few more of these medical marijuana patients lately?
I"ve heard of shopping around for the cheapest fare, but this is ridiculous!
I think you're right, that is Clark Gable. Go around again and see if we can get Claudette Colbert showing leg.
It’s the latest in economy standby.
Dont stop, he's looking for a Lyft.
Don't laugh! 90% of getting there is intention.
If he isn't Michael Landon, keep flying!
i wonder why theirs hitch hikers here theirs very little traffic on cloud 9
Forget it. We're not going his way.
The smog is pretty thick today!
That's the guy who wrote a guide to the galaxy.
Don't look. Just keep going.
Isn’t that the guy who bought a one-way ticket?
Don’t pull over. He’s clearly high.
I like modern art, but this goes a bit too far.
Okay, but frequent flier miles are out of the question!
Flight Center, we have a visual on a bogie who want's to boogie at ten thousand feet, please advise, over!
Sorry fella, we're going home.
This ain't the Hudson, Sully -- pull up, not over.
Amazon began adventure travel to the cloud
We can only take you as far as 25,000 feet
And I thought I was up in the clouds.
You ALWAYS stop for hitchhikers?
At least his head isn't in the clouds...maybe we should give him a chance?
Well, we could ask him to pay the checked bag fee.
He'll have to check his bag.
He gets high with a little help from his friends
Frank, this is probably a silly question, but doesn't that guy look like the Big Bopper?
We picked him up last week at this same spot, and here he is again. Why doesn't he get a drone?
Company rule against picking up hitchHighkers.
Don’t pick him up; he never puts his seat-back in the upright position for landing.
I'd stop for him but we're already behind schedule.
Another cloud 9 hippie.
Hey, Charlie, do we still have that extra seat in the cabin?
There's God slumming again.
Sure, we can pick him up; just remind him to bring a towel along with his guidebook.
Hey Russ, you wanna take the stick while I check the news to see if Neil Young just died?
If he asjscany questions, the answer is 42
Looks like Canada passed its marijuana legislation.
Looks like he's already gotten a lift
We can’t stop, sir, the carry on bins are full.
Sooner or later Cloud 9 was going to become a pick up station.
We only stop for hot women
That's pushing "The Friendly Skies, " a bit too much.
Another UberAir passenger dropped off on the wrong cloud.
Sure, as long as he has under 3.4 ounces of liquid in a travel-sized container, I'm happy to give him a ride.
You know they won't believe us, so let's not say a word.
They still don't have Uber here.
It's scam, I saw the same guy at O'Hare.
Just flip some switches and act like you don't notice him.
Haven't seen one of those since the 70's.
This is the first time I have ever seen someone on Cloud 9.
Hey You ....Get offa my cloud ....
Sorry--wrong galaxy Dude.
I don't think that the TSA manual covers this.
I guess he didn't understand the meaning of "exit row."
Yeah, I was looking for the highway to hell man, but I ended up on the stairway to heaven. Could you help me out?
Let's not do it, we have on-time performance records to maintain.
Wow, he's higher than a kite.
Do we let his cloud come aboard too?
Why that’s ole DB Cooper
Looks like we passed pilot training.
Serves him right for flying standby.
Computer, please suggest response.
I wouldn't say Millennial nor Gen Xer… He's more of a Space Xer.
Looks a little unsavoury. Let's not pick him up.
Was that Timothy Leary, or am I just hallucinating?
I don't see him, Sir. I wasn't even born in the 60s.
I used to stop for them but it's just not safe anymore.
I miss the days when flying was a big deal.
Good thing I reserved that parking space in heaven.
I think he took "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" a bit too literally.
They say he's a world changer, but all I see is 'hobo.'
The Tesla must have ejected him.
Looks like his "Guide to the Galaxy" didn't include a map to the airport.
He wasn't TSA pre-approved.
Sure. But we’re going to have to check that bag for you.
He must be higher than a kite.
You are doing good, young man. Even that guy is giving you a thumb.
Space cowboy
Don`t pick him up. Too scruffy looking.
I think we should speed up.
Take me higher babe!
this IS my first Seattle to Portland run, but still . . .
I never pick up balding guys with ripped jeans.
Captain, I think overbooking might be getting a little out of hand.
Like I've said many times....you can't beat optimism
Pick him up fast before the high wears off. Whatever he's on sure must be amazing. I didn't know the new boutique drugs could get them this high. Contact the FDA quick. The new strains of medical marijuana are getting them way to high.
I really hope someone picks the poor guy up before it starts raining
This is Major Tom to Ground Control, I’m stepping on a cloud and almost got smacked by a plane.
From a distance, I can't tell if his jeans are tattered or just the style.
Got to give him credit ... that’s one creative budget traveler!
I'm not sure I'd want to take him to his final destination.
My mother always told me not to stop for hitchhikers.
I just don't see cloud commuting becoming as widespread as cloud computing
He's high as a kite.
That 's the same guy we passed on Cloud 9 an hour ago
That looks like one of _our_ parachutes!
'We really need to stop over booking these flight Tom.'
All the overhead bins are full sir, you will have to go to the counter in order to check the bag.
Don’t stop. With that back pack he might be a terrorist merely pretending to be dead.
Hey you! Get off of my cloud. Hey you! Get off of my Cloud.
Think he would want 38d, it’s a middle seat in coach next to the crying baby?
Ignore him. His bag is way over the carry-on size limit.
Probably just some Deadhead.
Not again! Watch the left engine!
Well, I'd say he's definitely higher than a kite.
I’d stop except we have no more room for carry-ons
They never warn you about coming down from cloud9.
See, even that rando agrees you can totally pass for Stan Lee in his cameo roles after he dies, Captain.
Wow, guess heaven's not such a great place, after-all.
I guess Cloud 9 isn't what it used to be.
Now there's a cool frood.
Tim, if you wouldn’t mind scooting over a little...
Yeah, due to cutbacks they only earn one wing at a time.
Actually 34B is open.
Iswear he used to work at peace Air out of Alberta Canada
You're the Baby Boomer. Is it Stairway to Heaven, or Get Off of My Cloud!?
Hey, I lost my copy of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, so can I get a lift?
You're telling me there are more of these guys still trying to get home from Woodstock?
Used to be I'd stop
Wow! Weather forecasting is getting more and more accurate. This morning's paper called for cumulus clouds with occasional Gen - X hitchhikers.
It's all right. The wing will get him.
Ignore him. Just another snowflake looking for a free ride.
Cloud 9 this is Delta Air. Without that fuel tax, we can't land. We'll Circle back for you in a minute!
These back to back double shifts are making me see poor people.
Where's guide to the galaxy?
Just another hitchhiker trying to get to cloud nine.
We aren't that friendly.
Guessing we'll have to wait for the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy sequel to make sense of all this...
He certainly sticks out like a sore thumb.
How’d he get up here?
I'd say that he's carried the idea of wanderlust a bit far.
No, don’t pick him up...we kicked him off my last flight...his bag wouldn’t fit in the overhead.
We're not stopping. Cloud commuting it for the bird.
No, that cloud does not look like a horse to me.
They have GOT to do SOMETHING about this immigrant issue!
Ground control, we have another hitchhiker on cloud nine.
Hey Captain ! Is this the new way of boarding ”CloudStack” ?
But what if it’s Jesus in da skies?
It looks like those budget cuts to Air Traffic Control are beginning to bite.
Look, it's another hippy who wants to go back now that marijuana is legal." "Fly on. Like the others, he'll put his thumb down as soon as we tell him who's president.
I thought the Ascension would be a bit more interesting
I’m more surprised he doesn’t have an emotional support dog.
It's a scam. Look the other way.
We'll be landing at Stewart International in just a few minutes. If you look out the left side of the cabin you can see the ghost of another hippie still trying to get to Woodstock.
Boy, some private cloud platforms are really insecure.
He was told he was standing too close to the roadway, but he wouldn’t listen.
No way, we're overbooked as it is.
Looks like Michael Landon.
KEEP GOING, LET HIM TRY UBER.
I assume we're over Colorado.
The answer is 42
Wow! Another sorry Trump sucker who put his faith in faith.
That's nothing. Wait until we get to 30,000 feet.
Looks like United may be getting aggressive again.
My grandfather called them sky hobos.
I wonder how he ended up stuck on Cloud 8?
We can take you as far as Cloud 7, you’ll have to find a way to get the rest of the way.
Looks like he’s taking this cloud thing literally.
This is the new TSA Pre-Check procedure
I see what happened. He uploaded himself to the cloud. Now he can’t get back.
Coach? Can I be upgraded to first class?
Another one! Reprinting "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was a big mistake.
Is this what they mean by uploading to the cloud?
Can we at least offer him some peanuts?
Do you still have that F.B.I. sketch of D. B. Cooper?
I hate flying through Limbo
Ignore him. He doesn’t have an NRA discount.
Douglas Adams didn't get very far, did he?
Remember that weird guy who disappeared our last flight through here....
Don't stop; he definitely looks sketchy.
I never stop for the ones who look high on something.
Some folks will do anything to fly stand-by.
Just stop in the bike lane and pick him up. We have an Uber sticker.
The next low-cost travel - HitchhikeAir, "the half price airline"
Limbo sure is lower now !
Check this guy out, he's higher than a kite.
I'm trusting the "all knowing" cloud to get me to my maker.
Maybe all those extra fees really are too much?
Ginsberg is taking this Kerouac obsession a bit too far.
Hitchhiking through the galaxy...
Isn't that the same guy we picked up last week?
I-Cloud or Yours?
Great weather we're having today, eh?
We must be going in circles. I think we passed him a few clouds ago.
Probably, a fallen angel.
Don't stop. It's not safe to pick up hitchhikers.
You think he'll help pay for the gas?
Captain, do you remember that episode of Twilight zone with William Schatner?
Remember - in training, they told us not to pick up hitchhikers
You're flying too low Harold. Thats fog out there not clouds!
Oh no! Another one of those wing and a prayer situations.
Ah, I miss the biplane days sometimes.
I didn’t realize Neil Young had died.
I saw that same guy over Tokyo last week.
He’s heading to Cloudchella
We don’t have time to pick him up. We gotta land on the Hudson.
Well, Larry, we know he’s not a serial killer and we do have room.
Sure. But we'll definitely need to charge him for that oversized luggage
There but for fortune go you and I.
Rocky Mountain high?
We're too high.
Poor guy, he has his feet in the clouds
Better speed up. These guys like to jump on the wings to disturb the passengers.
How dangerous could he be? TSA cleared him.
I swear that's Clark Gable! Take her around again and see if we can't get a shot of Claudette Colbert showing some leg.
Did another state legalize marijuana?
I wish they never published “A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”
Garcia must have a gig.
I have heard the song ”Highway to Heaven”, but this is ridiculous!
There literally uploading everything to the cloud these days.
Yep, I remember my first day on the job! At this elevation, we get a glimpse of heaven.
Why doesn't he give up? I've told him we never land on Cloud Nine.
Is it me or is that dude is really high?
They call it cloud commuting.
Sorry. We're full up. OR Sorry - we don't stop for hitchhikers.
He's confused hail vs. hale.
These tiered boarding groups are getting out of hand.
Did that mushroom soup taste odd to you?
I TOLD you there was one missing from the manifest...
Don’t worry, the high elevation gets to you after a while.
Looks like Mick Jagger wants to get off his cloud
I shouldn't have eaten the fish.
He's got a ticket to ride but we don't care,
Don't slow down, and don't look him in the eye.
why am I not surprised?
I think I heard about this cloud commuting thing
Honey, please don't stop for him.
this happens every time I fly over Burning Man...
I was hoping this flight would go off without a hitch.
Every time we fly over Woodstock someone gets high.
Let bygones be bygones
We don't stop for nebulous characters."
You see a lot of that since they legalized marijuana...
I would gladly pick him up, but we don't even keep enough seats for our scheduled passengers.
I always thought the Second Coming would have trumpets.
That reminds me, ever read the book "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
Not today, we can't mess with our perfect on-time arrival record.
If United didn't want him, we don't want him either.
Is this the Last Plane to Clarksville?
This must be our missing passenger I McCloud!
Flying into Denver International used to be much easier.
Oh, look, there's the guy who gave us those delicious brownies in the terminal.
We have a seat but you'll still need to pay the change fee and fare difference.
That cloud kinda looks like a hitchhiker standing on a cloud.
No TSA lines for that guy.
Maybe we can throw him some peanuts & pretzels.
Captain, we've reached an altitude of 40,000ft." "I hope his family knows where he is. It'd kill me to know my kids were getting that high.
Don’t panic! There are hitchhikers all over the galaxy.
We better stop for him. That’s my parachute.
Another one of those disillusioned optimists who were damn sure they could get into Heaven.
This is what happens when we don't charge for air.
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
Check it out - Another Delta supporter!
I always tell my son to arrive two hours before departure.
My son is still practicing his halfpipe exercises.
I feel bad, but we still have that "No hitchhikers" rule.
We only pick up on Cloud 9.
He's one of the new icloud passengers we are taking on.
Hitch-hiker breach on cloud 444, repeat, 444, copy?
If he got elected, I thought they were going to move to Canada.
Let's turn around and pick him up
Sully, I hope those were geese!
Fly Me to the Moon
Okay. As long as it's an emotional support air of menace.
Galaxy or Bust
Sorry, we're full; the drone malfunctions are plentiful today.
I hate God’s new immigration policy
We're going too fast to stop, besides, he's higher than a kite.
Don't worry, we always get fallen angels around here.
He must be waiting for the Tesla.
He must be reading that book again
Hello! In case you didn't notice, I need a ride.
Isn't hitchhiking illegal over this state?
That guy's always there.
I guess it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.
I suppose it's better than having just your head in the clouds.
Poor fellow; that first 200 MB gets used up so fast.
Sorry, we're not going that way.
I say we stop to pick him up. It should be good for at least one viral video.
Don't stop. He's high.
He must be in boarding group 6.
Pilot 1: “Am I dangerously high or is that hobo standing on a cloud?” Pilot 2: “Both?”
Captain, we're directly above that corner in Winslow, Arizona.
Ooh someone just discovered Kerouac.
Guess it's been tough for these Cabinet Members without private jets...
I suppose he wants a ride to cloud 9.
One of us is in big trouble.
I guess this is the Bermuda Triangle Effect we’ve heard so much about.
Keep going...he looks high as a kite.
Poor devil
Dispatch: worried for AC asking for accident fail leave FIC: Freezing up there hoar Female SIO: Intercept proc: Squawk 7500 FAA forbids nudges with(out) female student pilot consent Squawk 7600 Backpacker clip your brown belt Squawk 7700
Do you layover in Purgatory?
Better not. We're flying over a prison.
Is this a plane or a time capsule?
Do you think he wants to trip on our jet?
I think he's wanting to get to nine!
I'm lost. Is he flashing an 'I love your plane' thumbs up or an 'I need a lift' thumbs up?
I'm not comfortable picking up hitchhikers.
Don't pick him up, he looks too high.
“I’ve heard about being high on life, but really?
And here I thought “The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy” was fiction.
He needs an up-dated edition of his guidebook.
I told you we shouldn’t have had the fish.
Apparently, they are still having problems with the Stairway to Heaven.
I this what they mean by "In the Cloud?"
Don't stop --- this is only cloud 8!
I NEVER KNOW WHETHER HE SAYS THAT WE,RE DOING OKAY OR IF HE WANTS A RIDE.
Never stop for hitchhikers. For all you know he might be a serial killer.
He'd have better luck if he wore a tie.
I'm sorry Captain Jones, I can't find anything in TSA regs about picking up hitchikers.
Entitled. He's part of the I cloud.
Hey, don’t pick him up. he looks high as a Kite.
Don't look. Keep driving. He's high.
What if it's Him, in disguise?
Oh yeah, everything is in the cloud these days.
The Twilight Zone? No, I don't believe I have.
Sometimes I think the cloud movement has gone too far.
What do you think, does he want a ride up or down?
Wow...That is taking "stand by" to a whole new level.
hmm . . . a cloud commuter using a thumb drive
If we drop him off after the celestial gates we can stay in the carpool lane.
I guess Some IT guys have to really travel to fix stuff
Sorry, Cloud Nine is back in the other direction.
Another attempt to bypass security lines!
Do you pick up hitch hikers?
Now that's what you call really wishful thinking!
He's probably one of those doctors without borders.
When angels run out of gas.
Is he as high as I think he is?
That's what happens when you stow away with Elon Musk.
Yeah ....... I heard he dropped out of Flight School in the sixties.
When angels run out of gas.
Unbelievable, Captain. I ran over that lowlife on my drive to the airport and he’s already asking for another ride.
Sorry Buddy, but your backpack doesn't meet the size requirements.
Another reject from Heaven.
Elon Musk, pre-Space X, dubbed Wind-Up X.
Maybe he's bored with the harp.
Yeah, the new half-trip tickets seemed like a good deal at first.
Tell me again about full service airlines…
United kicked me off. Do you have room for one more?
Looks like the prayer worked. What do you say we give him a wing?
Looks like another one of those characters from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
PULL OVER!
His carry-on was oversized.
Damn hippies. Always either high or trying to catch a ride.
Wow! He must be really high!
Just keep going! He looks like an undocumented alien.
Must be the Colorado Rocky Mountain high.
That guy is totally high.
A profit in our midst?
Umm Captain, did we move reservations to the Cloud?
Isn't that Elon Musk?
But what happens to us if we don't stop and it really is Jesus?
I don't stop for nebulous ones.
They're always finding new ways to use the Cloud.
Forget it. He looks high.
Nah, we'd just have to explain the dress code.
I would"t pick him up. He's higher than a kite.
You’d think by now they would know the carry-on size limits.
I don’t know — didn’t TSA warm us about a cloud stalker?
That is what comes from a "holier than thou attitude."
Man, we are really, really of course this time!
Another hitchhiker guide to the galaxy!
I know we've had a lot of bad press lately, but at least we deal with overbooked flights before take-off!
That probably isn't the market share that Spirit Airlines was hoping to capture.
Don't pick him up, he's clearly high.
Shall we give it a try?
Hay, wasn't he the star of hitch hiker guide to the universe?
We told him repeatedly,”there would be consequences if he didn’t move his backrest to an upright position.
Another one trying to avoid the TSA check in lines.
Don't look! Thats not our cloud.
I guess He really doesn’t have a plan.
Uber-Air still has some kinks to work out
That's one service I never thought would move to the cloud.
I have always wondered how those things stay up in the air.
Hey, Isn't that the guy from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
Probably a hacker who got lost in the cloud.
Boy, air traffic control really took a hit with those budget cuts.
Don’t pull over Bob. The cabin’s full of sky-hitchers today.
Ah...should we tell him his airline miles only get him to Cloud 5?
And you said the ICloud was in North Carolina.
That's weird, nobody hitchhikes anymore.
I know everything's moving to the cloud, but...
Looks like Cumulous Air was overweight again.
If we can get him with the checked baggage fee, I don't see why not.
The wingspan on the A320?? About 120 feet, why do you ask?
He must be the guy who wouldn't put his tray table up last year.
I never thought that is what angels look like.
It's this guy again, still hoping for a free ride to cloud nine.
He's a loose-thumbed godlet craving an upgrade.
I'd guess he's headed to Cloud 9.
Approach, this is niner- two-four. We have a visual on the runaway
any chance you are going to Jersey?
I'm not using your help to get high, I promise.
Can't he see that we're not going up?
You don't see that many hitchhikers anymore.
yep we are now flying over colorado
I hope that is a parachute he is wearing. Rain is coming.
Same guy, out here every week, and each time, he's insists not an Angel, the Devil or Millennial.
Sorry, no upgrades available.
I thought the Cloud was for storage.
Keep going. We just passed a correctional facility.
Must have been ticketed in basic economy when they played musical chairs.
We just dropped you off and can't stop again until 3:30 when we pick you up.
How can you stand on a cloud?" "I don't know." "Because you have a jet pack!
Oh so that's what happens to United passengers.
Tower, just passing Cloud Nine.
It's just the iCloud repair guy.
You can upload anything to the cloud these days.
Poor guy, he wants to finish his 5th farewell tour.
We’re supposed to pick up our Air Marshal around this elevation, but that guy looks a little too high to be an Air Marshal.
He must have backed-up everything to the cloud.
No! Absolutely not. May I remind you what happened, the last time you said, "They look Harmless"?
Isn't that the S.O.B. that laughs when you stop for him and says, " Just kidding!"?
Just what we need: another poet with his head in the clouds!
Elon Musk’s Tesla must have run out of juice.
We wouldn't have room for the carry on
Hitching a ride down from Cloud 9 is a bitch.
It's D. B. Cooper. Maybe he wants to give himself up.
Unless he has a guitar, forget it.
I had no idea 'A hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy' was an autobiography .
Heaven knows, Mr. Alyson.
Geese ahead. Captain, please pay attention.
Ha! Remember Harold! And how we asked him for one little thing?
You never know what people store in their Cloud.
My rideshare app says he's going from Seventh Heaven to Cloud Nine.
This is the problem with cars in space
Burning Man is terrible this year
At least he’s not flipping us off this time.
That must be really good pot.
I think he's high enough.
Isn't that the guy they wouldn't let on?
"Face it dude: here comes homo polex in friendly skies".
You know, there's his old lady and dog hiding somewhere.
Some people will do anything for a lift.
Makes you wonder what's in the bag.
Don't worry, I was a hitchhiker too when we took off.
Is that a hitchhiker or am I really high?
Do you have a few bucks on you?
I don’t know. He looks a little high.
Wow, they reaccommodated the hell out of that guy.
My Roadster ran out of gas!
Remember when hitchhiking wasn’t weird?
Once they lose their wings they can be real pests.
It's work a shot. Consider the return on 200 thousand since '71.
Dad!?
I guess he bought the guide to the friendly skies by mistake.
Bumped in mid-flight never a good sign.
Mile High Club, party of one.
We don't have enough leg room.
Oh no, it's God again, testing whether humans are kind.
I thought this was the highway to heaven.
Los Angeles? That's where we're headed! Stopping first in Detroit & laying over in Portland…
He must be really tripping.
And passengers in Basic Economy are reminded that things could be marginally worse.
That's the same guy who was out there last week. Do you still think he's only a mirage, not a hallucination?
He refused to use the overhead compartment.
Apparently, cloud 9 is not all it's cracked up to be.
Cloud commuting!
I take hitchhiking to the next level
Sorry, Buddy, we're full.
Do you think he's past PSA?
Millenials, to your left, smirk as we pass by; in the flesh you’ll find another Baby Boomer's failed attempt to "upload to the cloud"
He's TSA Free.
It's amazing what people will try to get away with in a carry-on.
There goes the neighborhood.
Millenials, to your left, smirk as we pass by; you’ll find the last living vestige of a Baby Boomer's failed attempt to "upload to the cloud.”
Well, the forecast did say cloudy with a chance of Cobain.
Imagine having to sit on a cloud playing a harp all day, every day, forever and forever.....you'd want out too.
Makes you wonder what Heaven is like when you see these guys trying to escape.
He got bumped from the red-eye to Orlando.
forget it...that duffle bag exceeds the allowed dimensions for the overhead baggage compartment
I don't know, Captain... he looks high as a kite.
Thesenbums are everywhere, just ignore him.
No way - didn't you ever see the movie "The Hitcher"?
Sorry pal, these skies aren’t that friendly.
They said gate nine, not cloud nine.
Douglas Adams fans are regularly spotted here.
For some reason, every time we fly past that guy, I think of Rod Serling
Sorry dude, Patagonia is not on the flight plan
Ignore him or he'll start bothering every plane that flies by.
My wife told me not to pick up strangers!
I'd give him a ride he looks cirrus
He always hangs around here. Just try not to make eye contact.
That's pretty disturbing to see clouds as solid matter. Maybe we should be more careful.
Ten bucks says United.
Well I guess the could migration program is complete!
Heaven isn't what it used to be.
Wanna get high?
Why not, we are short a flight attendant!
Welcome to your final destination See you soon!
Oh yeah, that’s just Jesus trying to jerk your chain.
Sorry dude, but we're going back down. If you want a lift, you'll have to wait for the spaceship.
Looking elsewhere for immunity.
You're right, that's not a cumulus cloud, it's a plume of marijuana smoke.
It happens whenever we serve magic mushrooms in first class.
You think that’s the guy with the guide to the galaxy in his backpack?
Usually his dog is with him.
This guy's lighter than air...and dig those crazy pants...
We can't Captian, this one's too high
No room in coach, and the overhead bins are full.
Another drifter!
Next time lets use the GPS.
Just another falling angel dangling.
That's Cloud 9, Buddy - not Gate 9.
they load everything to the cloud these days
I say pick him up. He's got the face of an angel!
Just another economy passenger looking for an upgrade.
He kinda looks like Douglas Adams. You know, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy guy.
What the hell is Benjamin Schwartz doing outside his cartoon, man?
Again?
He can take the stairway back too.
" He souldn't have never bought a used Tesla".
If he thinks he can get by security with that trick he’s out of his mind.
No way! Not until he's gone through airport security.
Did you press the Improbability Drive button again?
Looks good from where I’m standing
I only pick up people if they're heading to Cloud 9.
I thought the book was fiction.
Unless we get a TSA. O.K., we can’t take a chance!
Laguardia’s so crowded, they’re storing passengers on the cloud now.
Don't make eye contact. They just want you to feel guilty.
Don't stop for him, he's high.
Cloudy but clearing, Roger that weather dude!.
What a coincidence. I just finished "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
Old out-take from 'The Twilight Zone.'
Ignore him. He's hitchhiking to Heaven.
Flight control says if we see the hippie then we’ve gone too far.
It's Throwback Thursday for ride sharing.
Erm, let's just stop for the next one...
(Co-pilot), "No really I saw this on the Twilight Zone".......(Pilot), "It doesn't matter where you saw it ...what we see we up here stays up here..."
Cloud nine might be overrated.
Don't stop. He looks shady.
Never again....one more rendition of Kum ba yah and I'll nose dive this sucker.
I’d pick him up, but it doesn’t look like that bag will fit in the overhead compartment.
Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy indeed!
We can take you as far as Cloud Eight.
Isn't that Elon Musk?
I’d love to pick him up but I don’t trust the air brakes
Angels don't have wings anymore?
Not with that as a carry-on bag.
Should we pick him up or do you think he's just too high?
I'll bet he just read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
After driving through space, Starman realized he had to get home on his own.
Cloud nine has no landing strip.
Looks like D. B. Cooper is still up here.
Missed his connection from Canaveral.
Talk about having your head in the clouds
Third time this week. Will this guy ever make it to cloud nine?
Well, at least he gets overhead bin space.
Going my way?, I just passed him on I-95.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit LSD.
Just ignore him. This happens every time they reprint that damned Guide.
Don't stop, Jerry, that guy looks high.
Hard to believe spring break is here already.
Don't pick him up - that guy just got dragged off a United flight.
Are you sure there's nothing about this in the flight manual?"
Just avoid eye contact.
Eh... looks like Elon forgot where he parked again.
We do appreciate your patience, ladies and gentlemen. Now, if no one else has any complaints, we'll be on our way. Thank you for flying the friendly skies.
He is in the proper upright and locked position.
It's Kerouac again. He can't seem to settle down anywhere.
The stairway to heaven must be open to the public again.
Twenty bucks says he can land this thing at LAX, and everyone survive
He doesn't look high from here.
He's discovered the only thing we don't have a fee for.
This is why I really like being an Uber pilot
It’s not a good place to stop.
There he is again on cloud nine.
GOOD IM NOT DRIVING. I'VE BEEN DRINKING.
Oh, he's just in economy standby class
Is HE the guy who wrote Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
Guess he dropped the tin-can schtick
Looks like an opportunity for UBER to expand its horizons !
Sky pilot to galaxy hitchhiker do you read over
Another backpacker who couldn't finish the Vapor Trail.
I guess we do one way trips to Heaven now too.
Do you have any checked luggage?
E.T. is stranded again.
I thought you told that guy to get off of my cloud.
Getting tired of his views about life,the universe an everything?
The FAA is always watching, but this surveillence idea isn't very well grounded.
I'm sure someone will stop.
he really wants to maintain his gold status...!
I hate stopping for these extreme discount standby passengers.
It lacks a human element.
We're the Friendly Skies, but not that friendly.
Well that's one way to earn SkyMiles.
"Another wistful silver lining searcher".
Well, I guess now I've seen everything.
This is what happens when you mix inflight Wi-Fi, cloud computing, and the Bermuda Triangle.
Keep flying, I've got a feeling this one's no angel.
Yeah I also had the fish. Why do you ask?
Let's not pick him up. Looks like he's high.
He's not using oxygen -- we must be below 20,000 feet.
Pick him up! He has the guide to the galaxy!
Oh, that's just Douglas Adams, the eternal hitchhiker.
Somebody need to teach that guy how to download from the the cloud
Hey man, get a job!
Last time I picked him up, all he talked about was some new ride share app.
For the passengers on the left, not to worry, this is a non-stop flight.
Delta, stop! I want a flight out of Georgia.
It's probably just a quantum fluctuation.
That’s what happens when you end up on Cloud Eight.
Never pick up a hitchhiker when you’re eight miles high.
Keep looking straight, there's nothing to see on the side.
Okay, but we'll have to download him from the cloud.
Probably just the latest TSA security test.
It's too bad this is a nonstop flight.
Wow, I just remembered my password.
This is how every splatter film starts.
Man, I told you those mushrooms tasted weird.
I didn't know the frequent flyer miles expired.
I think he is trying to get to cloud nine.
Looks like Dent forgot his towel
Another one who travels on a wing and a prayer.
This must have been what life was like before ride-sharing apps.
That guy must be sky high.
We're entering California airspace.
Most of them are headed to cloud nine, but that’s not on our route, so it would be best to leave it to the planes that are headed there.
He must be our deadhead to San Francisco.
There’s one empty seat. Too bad it’s in first class.
I guess he got lost on his way to Cloud Nine.
That must have been some kick ass weed.
Let’s keep driving. He looks high.
Poor devil...Cloud Nine must not be what it's cracked up to be.
No, more turn around flights management said we need to think outside of the box tell him we are overbooked works for me
What's he high on?
I’m not stopping. I don’t like his altitude.
Don't stop; he's clearly high.
It's some dorky guy with a quizzical look on his face - that's not art!
I notice his thumb is pointed upward. Do you think he is trying to hitchhike to heaven?
I think God is trying to tell us something.
Why would anyone want to leave Cloud Nine?
That awkward moment when you land on Cloud 8 instead of Cloud 9.
He's been high a kite since '67.
Old Elvis?
I'd pick him up, but his carry-on is over the size limit.
So, the song goes "What if God was one of us. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Tryin to make his way home." An so now, there he is, everyday. Nevermind the bus part.
That sure looks like Elon Musk. Should we offer him a ride?
As long as he is not on the no flying list I don’t care
The number of boarding groups has gotten out of control.
We can always waive the baggage fee.
Flying standby has taken a turn for the worse.
Did you ever read "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"?
I don't know. What do you think TSA would say?
Sometimes it doesn't pay to get bumped
He's been trying to get to his 'final destination' all week.
In his defense, there’s a lot less competition up here. Do you think he’s cold?
Can't risk it - he's not TSA pre ??
I remember when I used to get that high.
Attention passengers, our flight has been overbooked. Many of you will have to find your own way home.
We'll get him with our wing.
Let's keep going. I hate those jeans with the pre-torn knees.
There is definitely something special in the air!
Are ripped jeans a thing again? I just can't keep up with these trends.
This time he pays full fare.
Well if you want to come back and get him on the way to your Nirvana connection, fine by me Ted, but I'm not taking him with us to Elysium.
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's Door
Maybe if the last album had been better.
Sully, don't do it.
He should have read the fine print before buying basic economy.
I say if he's still here on our way back, we pick him up.
No free rides for dreamers. I don't care if he's going to LA, too.
normally i'd say give the guy a lift, but it looks like he's already there.
So, Sully, you wanna try for a second miracle?
He didn’t want to pay the baggage fees.
Hey, isn't that the guy who used to live on Cloud Nine?
Only if he's willing to kick in for gas.
It's amazing what they keep on the Cloud these days.
If we pick hime up, we can make up the time between here and the coast.
He looks like he skipped TSA and went straight to LSD.
I'm not surprised. All the music's in the cloud these days.
I bet he's headed to Cloud 9.
But will his backpack fit in the overhead?
Is that an iCloud?
Better make a U turn, I think that's Jesus
Ah Hell, that's my sister's kid, we gotta pick him up. He obviously forgot, NEXT week is 'Bring loser nephew to work day!'
YOU KNOW THE COMPANY POLICY "NO HITCHHIKERS"
I still think I am good enough to be on "Twilight Zone"......
Nope. Everybody goes through TSA.
I don't think he's going our way
”Stopped takin’ them ever since Manson died”.
That guy is definitely high.
I'm serious. "Forty two" IS the answer!
Just act like you don't see him.
I've always wondered where the 70s ended up.
Permission to retrieve my emotional support dog, Captain?
Holy Hitchhiker!!!
‘He must’ve got in with the wrong cloud’
I'd pick him up, but he looks high.
times are changing
I wouldn’ t stop sir, we’re in a prison zone.
Look's like someone forgot their guide to the galaxy...
Those budget airline layovers are rough.
Maybe he has some Bud Light?
Living on cloud nine isn’t what it used to be.
He is heading Up; We are heading East.
He's on his way down, too, I suppose.
We can take you as far as The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.
Get a load of this guy's flotation device.
Do we have room for one more.?
Back in the Sixties I'd have stopped and given him a ride, but not these days.
Let's pick him up, he may know how to get to the airport from here.
Let’s not stop. He look high.
I guess we aren’t flying as high as I thought.
This guy is sure taking his time getting home from Woodstock.
Just saw him in the "Standby" seating.
That guy's got some serious sky miles.
Captain, I had no idea a cloud could support an individual.
It's too bad we're not going his way.
Some people will do anything to avoid checked bag fees...
Keep going. There's a Tesla going his way coming by soon.
Weird. Just yesterday he was yelling, "Hey, hey, get off of my cloud!"
We've gotta stop taking those long layovers in Denver.
Shall we let him wing it?
Does he want a ride, or is he telling us good job?
1. HIS CARBON FOOTPRINTS ARE INVISIBLE 2. LEAVES NO CARBON FOOTPRINT 3. THESE BUDGET CARRIERS KEEP CUTTING FRILLS 4. THAT'S A NO-FRILL BERTH IF I SAW ONE
I don't care if he is lighter than air. We are in a no stopping lane.
Like that would fit in the overhead compartment.
Ignore him! He looks suspicious
I Wanna go HIGH-er
Sully could do it.
That's why I don't save my files in the cloud.
Douglas Adams
I’d pull over but this shoulder is too narrow.
I'd take him but that bag looks overweight.
Could you drop me off at cloud nine?
He must be one of those new cloud commuters.
High Maintenance Passenger. We call Gate 9, he waits on Cloud 9.
Don't even think about it. His carry-on is way too big.
Don't stop, he hasn't passed through the metal detectors.
Keep flying, my mother always told me never to pick up anyone below 15,000 feet.
Don't stop, it could be dangerous
I haven’t see that spirit here since 1969.
Thought flyhiking wasn’t allowed in this zone
Hmm another Cloud Nine-er. Third one I've seen today.
So that's where "chemtrails" come from
I heard the big guy switched to digital.
HitchHIGHker. Get it?
I heard the big guy went to an all-digital format.
Thought hitchflying wasn’t allowed in this zone
Entering California cannabis airspace.
Cloud storage for the homeless.
At least he'll have a good reference for his next gig.
He’s hoping it stays partly cloudy.
I heard the big guy switched to hip-hop.
Wherever he’s trying to go, I bet it’s not Cleveland Ohio.
Glad we can't stop. He's obviously high on something.
Must be that new cloud-based app. for filling empty seats.
It's sure getting cloudy.
We could, except he went through the wrong security gate
The Global Entry option is getting out of control.
Captain, don't stop, he looks suspiciously unhappy to be on cloud 9.
I wouldn't. That hippie's high as a kite. Higher, even.
What people will do to avoid TSA screening.
Flying standby ain't what it used to be.
Ask if he's TSA pre-approved.
Looks like he ran out of bonus miles.
I'm getting a warning light here . . .
There's another Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy nut.
Sure hope he's packed a parachute-- since the only option up here is a thumbs down one-way trip
Flying-by-night is his best option.
No, I don't mind picking him up but make sure you shove him in the back of economy.
Isn't that illegal above 10,000 feet?
I always knew he was on Cloud 9.
Flying seems less safe since Congress deregulated gravity.
He showed up there just after California legalized Marajuana. Im not sure he’s even real.
We have that empty seat in first class, but he's not your coat and tie kind of passenger.
I'd pick him up, but there's no safe place to pull over.
Isn't that the guy who was missing off of the passenger manifest?
Climb.
We can't pick him up, his carry-on's too big.
Just another unsuccessful migration to the Cloud
You've heard of flying hell? That's flying purgatory.
Most amazing thing about the cloud? Unlimited access.
He’s probably harmless, and he needs to get off that cloud, but I cannot justify waiving the baggage fee for him.
"I always thought that when Jesus returned to Earth, he'd just, you know, appear.
I guess he never read The Hitchhiker's Guide To The galaxy.
TSA doesn't allow us to pick up hitchhikers.
A hitch-hiker on a cloud , no more cannabis for me !
How on earth did he get here!?!!
Some people aren't cut out for the exit row.
Probably just looking for a lift to cloud nine.
Can you believe there are still Deadheads out there?
Those TSA prechecks are getting ridiculous.
Let's pick him up. We were in college once too.
I am not giving D.B. Cooper another ride
I think he wants to go up to Cloud Nine."
I can never tell if they want a ride or they're just giving us a thumbs up.
Appears he’s lost his guide to the universe.
I hope he realizes we no longer serve food.
Sully, we don't have time to pick up hitchhikers. We are in the middle of a crisis!
Cloud culture. Get used to it.
Black Panther was awesome, seriously.
Layover Terminal for Air Acme U-Save.
Let him walk.
Hmm, rethinking my plan to put my personal data in the cloud.
He should have gone through Atlanta.
Looks like cloud 9 is not all it's chalked up to be.
Did you ever watch the Twilight Zone?
Do you think he would be willing to kick in for gas?
First came cloud computing, and now we’ve got cloud commuting.ppppp
There's another guy that doesn't know anything about BBQ's
“Don’t look Sulley, it only encourages them”.
We'll I guess we've got cloud commuting now.
We were warned about the guys who didn't get Gold.
Millennials think they can do anything
Pretend like you don't see him.
Don't do it, I saw twilight zone. I know how this ends.
Is he kidding?
The airline did assure us they were working on some new routes
Don't even think about it
Ok, fine, but he’s going to have to check that bag.
The Captain says it's a brain-dead old hippie high on Cloud Nine.
Looks like another icloud deserter.
Looks like Captain Jack got high last night.
Wow, the dude is literally eight miles high.
We can't stop, thats not a carry-on he has!
Ground control, I believe we've found Major Tom.
Looks like a "fly by the seat of your pants" kind of guy.
Sully, how many flights is too many flights?
Apparently we didn't waive our change fee.
it's up to us the lawyers find neither stratospheric law nor precedent.
He’ll want to come back if he sees LaGuardia.
Getting down from Cloud nine... that's the hard part
Sully, I know you are all about helping people and saving lives, but picking up hitchhikers is dangerous!
He must have missed the cumulonimbus.
He got there on Maryjane. He can get home on Maryjane
Ever since Space X sent up that car, I've seen more and more of these guys.
We're entering California airspace.
tell him we'll come back for him
Should I tell him we’re fully booked or do you think he’s so high that he won’t understand?
Nope. He doesn't have Global Re-entry.
What galaxy do you think he is from?
I must admit, he has lofty expectations.
Guess the Beats are back, still going nowhere.
Elon Musk needs to get on this.
You wonder how he makes a living hitchhiking from one galaxy to another.
He's been on standby for years.
Hi I am your cloud storage server
That's the third one. Should we stop?
Wow, I can't remember the last time I saw anyone hitchhiking.
‘We’re not the only ones flying high!’
I would, but the last time he tried to crash at my place.
Maybe he thinks we're a VW bus.
Captain: ‘Going up to the spirit in the sky...’ Co-Pilot: ‘...spirit in the sky.’
And risk our on-time arrival rating. I don’t think so.
Nice gesture, but he should have just ‘Liked’ us.
I hope he knows ‘Stairway to Heaven’.
Never pass up a guardian angel.
He’s been there forever.
You want to pick him up?? Cirrusly???
I’d pick him up, but we’re about to go through the Bermuda Triangle and it seems like tempting fate.
Don't worry- he's with me.
I could swear I saw him at a Dead Concert a while ago.
Wow, he looked a lot smaller on the simulator.
I gave a ride to one last week, but he wanted to smoke dope so I had to kick him off.
That's my soccer coach from sixth grade.
The Pilot has realized a little late that the flight was overbooked.
Love to help the guy, but don't have TSA to frisk him for weapons...
Thanks to Spacex, everyone's trying to get into higher orbit.
I know you think all homeless people are jerks, but this brother is an angel!
Hey look, that’s the fifth hobo angel since Detroit!
We should tell him that there no longer are flights to Woodstock.
Ignore him. He needs a ride to the SkyMall.
" Flight 1975, this is Ground Control to Major Tom: Sky Pilot be aware of men Hitchin a Ride." - over
Have you ever seen a grown man naked?
We can't. That is more than 4 ounces of liquid.
I guess we have everything in the cloud these days.
Don’t look. You’ll only encourage him
The Tower said he could board from Cloud 9, but the airline says his carry on is too big.
I wouldn't stop, he's obviously high.
It's a whole different job now that Burning Man has moved to the clouds.
So this is what happens when you crash into the ocean.
He probably just wants a lift to the nearest Air B&B
That's the guy that got off Mick Jagger's cloud.
This cloud surfing thing has gone too far
It's too bad we're overbooked.
Airbus-stop number 9.
No way, Sully! You can’t save everyone.
That's cloud four our hub is cloud nine
Everyone has to get to cloud 9 somehow
Unbelievable. There is no way that carry-on will fit in the overhead compartment.
Isn't that what Lyft is for?
I would but we're at capacity now.
I can't see his feet but I bet he's wearing wingtips.
First baggage, now standby!
Jim, you gotta try this coffee.
Thanks, dude. We appreciate your thumbs up!
Sorry buddy - non- stop flight.
If we pick him up, we'll have to hear the story about how he was robbed and left on a deserted cloud.
If he wants a ride, he's going to have to bump someone.
My no good brother-in-law. Ignore him.
Is he high?
Still there? Why doesn't he just walk?
Who does he think we are--Spirit Airlines?
He ran out of frequent flyer miles over Atlanta.
He’s really gone the extra mile.
Is he high or are we low?
So that's where D.B. Cooper went.
Only if he gets rid of his nail clipper and bottle of water.
Do you see what I see?
He forgot to upload his ticket to paradise.
I didn't see anything and neither did you.

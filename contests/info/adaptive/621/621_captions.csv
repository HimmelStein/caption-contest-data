She’ll appreciate you’re wearing protection.
Our welder comes in on Wednesdays if you’re interested in complimentary alterations.
It’s off the rack.  The guy on the rack doesn’t need it anymore.
It does make you look slightly middle-aged.
Yes, of course you’ll have the only key, Mrs. Trump.
May I say, sir: quite riveting.
If you like it, I'd suggest going ahead before the steel tariffs hit.
Can I interest you in some Under Armour to go with that?
Perfect for a knight on the town.
LIMERICK: When buying a nice suit of steel...No matter how good it may feel...You do have to watch...If it's tight in the crotch...Cause it'll make you scream when you kneel.
Will you be billing this to the E.P.A. as well sir?
It says "old money, really old money."
Oh a 'suit of Armani?' Our mistake sir.
It also comes in stainless.
Congratulations on becoming the new White House Press Secretary, by the way.
May I inquire what the bride is wearing, sir?
Dressed to kill, eh?
All you need is a little altercation.
Of course, it's no iron
As a matter of fact, there is a silver lining.
If I may ask, sir, Renaissance fair or confirmation hearing?
I agree, the belt would be too much.
It's popular among Middle Age men.
It works for a casual joust or that formal crusade.
A word of caution, Sir:  always lift the visor before you fart.
And if the FBI comes, just stand quietly against the wall. They’ll never know, Mr. President.
It comes with an assortment of refrigerator magnets too.
We also have it available in imported steel for 25% more.
Of course, it may slow you down a bit at airport security.
I haven't sold one of these in ages.
A bit snug in the codpiece, but we can hammer that out.
Every fashion comes around again if you wait long enough.
....and we'll throw in 2 years of WD-40
You're not the first woman to come here looking for something more appropriate for the workplace.
Will this be the usual EPA billing, Secretary Pruitt
You should have thought of that before you tried it on.
Sir, the power suit never goes out of style.
Are you sure that that 'knight in shining armor' wasn't just a metaphor she was using?
Medieval and self-righteous. Perfect for border security.
I don't think that's what she meant by "protection," sir.
I like it, but do you think it makes me look stiff?
Can I interest you in a coat of arms?
It normally would come with a sword, but it was recently stuck into a desk for another cartoon.
Sorry, ma’am, only our men’s version has pockets.
From the same era as your policies, Mr. Ryan.
Believe me, all Republicans will be wearing them soon.
It's thee!
Have you thought about moving to a safer neighborhood?
For 25% more, you can get it in Canadian steel.
If it's too heavy I can show you something in aluminum.
Sure, let me get the blowtorch and I'll let the crotch out a little.
It says, "I'm a disruptor, but I value tradition, too."
It always feels a little stiff when you first put it on.
Sir, all you need now is a heart.
It's the ideal suit for a knight out on the town.
Just think of it: you'll be among the first to be appropriately dressed for the dark age that we have entered!
Dress for the job you want, not for the job you have.
Best of luck on your first day as new Press Secretary.
Maybe something a little more Camelot and a little less Crusades?
Of course, you'll still be vulnerable to crippling self-doubt.
Now you've got mail.
It's a hard look to pull off
It's what all the press secretaries are wearing.
Its called Over Armor, and its the next big thing"
With what you save on dry cleaning, it pays for itself.
Splendid.  Would you like rustproofing?
Our on-site welder can have it ready in an hour.
First crusade?
It's no iron.
It's a riveting look.
Irony suits you, sir.
It's very popular with Middle Aged men right now.
We also offer an exquisite selection of non-iron suits.
Oh, and don't lick the inside of it when it's cold.
It's you, Mr. Secretary, but if it seems extravagant, I can bill it as "personal security" to your EPA account.
No sir, it doesn’t make you look middle aged.
Polished. Timeless. And right off The Rack.
Can we add you to our chain mail list?
I'll throw in a can of WD-40.
Well, it pretty much settles the "Flight or Fight," question, sir.
Yes you do look like an idiot but that’s pretty much the only downside.
I have it in rust, too.
So, finally decided to attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner?  Very good sir.
Tailoring is free, but the rust-proofing is extra.
The welder is on his way to fix the fly.
It’s LA. You don’t really need a tie.
It’s also guaranteed to protect you from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
This season, imported Italian is out, domestic steel is in.
If you pay cash, I'll cover the tariff...
And the best part is that it's wrinkle free.
I believe your drawbridge is down.
Not functional? Surely you joust.
Thinking the customer was driving a hard bargain, Phil continued to sell to the empty suit until well after lunch.
It's the latest from our Ready To War collection.
And if you want to look approachable, just flip up the visor!
This year is all about feudalism
Ready to meet with your constituents, Senator?
Wear it straight into battle or shall I box it?
Oh, absolutely!  We provide free altercations.
I’ll sell it to you, but I’m pretty sure she meant it figuratively.
Does Sir joust right or left?
Your father hand picked this prom dress.
May I say sir, this really accentuates your diminished sense of self.
It's vintage
A slimming fit. Makes you look 700 years younger.
I’d buy it now before the tariffs kick in.
Is this a personal crusade or a biblical one?
Oh, could you possibly have meant Armani?
Don’t worry, that part is velcro.
About forty seconds, with practice. Longer for number two."
Family reunion?
You’re the 3rd Trump personal attorney we’ve fitted this week.”
You may have taken her dating profile a bit too literally.
And you can always dress it down with flip-flops.
It's meant to be untucked.
Do you joust to the right or to the left?
Perhaps you should just get divorced.
It comes with an extra gauntlet in case you throw one down.
Perfect! I believe you're ready for your meeting with Mr. Weinstein, Ma'am!
Dressed to kill, I'd say.
... and nobody will know you’re naked.
Will this be your first time at a roundtable discussion?
The suit adds 100 pounds even without the mirror.
I’m sorry, but the sale ended June 17, 1218.
It is made of aluminum so it is much lighter.However, you are subject to a 25% tariff if you re- enter the U.S.
And, it's no iron
"Well it's your fairytale wedding too…"
You sacrifice a little comfort but it holds a crease like forever.
Will you be needing something for the horse?
Yes, sire. It does, alas, make your butt look big.
...but now imagine it adorned with the blood of your enemies.
It's from our "Chivalry Is Not Dead" collection.
Of course it usually isn't worn with brown shoes.
Not only does it wear like iron, it's also permanent press.
It'll go perfectly with her chastity belt.
I agree. Definitely cut back on the eight glasses of water a day.
I SAID IT FITS YOU PERFECTLY.
Staying alive never goes out of fashion.
It takes 700 years off you.
Sir, some may say it makes you look standoffish, but I say it makes you look positively impenetrable.
It comes with a catheter.
We call it Over Armour.
Is that your happy voice or is it still a bit tight in the crotch?
We also have that one in 'relaxed fit'.
Yes, it’s iron and no iron.
It's just the thing for a knight on the town!
And it's on sale for one knight only.
Your sword is still stuck in the desk from last week's cartoon.
Plus, it's recyclable
Not many guys can pull this off. I mean, it's literally almost impossible to pull off.
I don't know about 'I'm in charge,' but it definitely screams 'Charge.'
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
Just dare them to call you an empty suit, now.
I suggest you buy now. The price should go up 50% once the tariffs are in place.
Alterations are over in Hardware.
It says, "I'm a capitalist with feudalist ambitions."
Yes, wash separately, sir.
The question you want her to ask herself is "Why is this knight different from every other knight?"
I think you can pull off shining, but we also carry brushed nickel.
This one gives you abs of steel.
It’s clanky, but not clunky.
I would still recommend using a condom ...
It's the perfect thing to wear for a knight out on the town.
And you never have to iron it.
A most fitting suit for your middle ages, Sir.
On the plus side, no one will ever ask you to talk about your feelings.
This is the last suit you'll ever need.
It fits you well. Would you like to see it with a horse underneath?
It’s what all the Republicans are wearing these days.
I can also recommend a good blacksmith if you need to have it tailored.
Yes, it is wrinkle free, but it does make a hell-of-a racket in the dryer.
And it'll never wrinkle--wears like iron.
I think the colander adds a nice touch.
You can jazz it up with some fridge magnets.
Beautiful fit, Sir. The key is to measure twice, weld once.
This is perfect if you freelance a lot.
And you’re sure the invitation said knight time attire?
And, it has a cell phone pocket.
It makes you look six feet. No one can tell that the eye holes are in your breast plate
Now, all you need is a heart.
And our blacksmith does alterations.
It's not the mirror, the breastplate really does add 10 lbs.
No sir, you still need to use a condom.
It won’t wrinkle, but it might dent.
It also comes with collision coverage and roadside assistance.
It says: “I really don’t care. Do you”?
We call this particular cut the 'Modern Republican'
Just don't think of things that make you feel itchy.
It offsets M’Lady’s chastity belt.
Why yes Sir, it's perfect for a knight out on the town.
It’s your time to shine.
Your fly is unlatched.
If you’re going through a middle age crisis, then this is the suit for you
I assure you this style is very popular among Middle-Aged men.
And on which side does the gentleman wear his lance?
Yes, sir, you're dressed to kill.
I’d say it’s riveting.
Best of all, it's fully recyclable.
It's looks great on men in their Middle Ages.
They don't call you a Renaissance man for nothing.
Enjoy your trip to Canada, Mr. President.
And may I suggest a horse"?
Now that's what I call a power suit.
Our welder can have it ready this afternoon.
You will find airport security inconvenient.
Yes, sir, I agree that a white linen pocket square might send mixed signals.
Now, what size sword are you?
But you understand, this still will not protect you from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
It’s very 1350s
Oh, absolutely - all the senators are wearing these to their town hall meetings these days.
If I may be so bold, sir, the wenches will go crazy.
Anticipating a hostile takeover, are we, sir?
It's from our midterm collection: bespoke retro-industrial with a soupçon of irony.
Alternatively, you could go with linen and a better lawyer.
The classics are always in style, sir.
So, when DO you start as White House Press Secretary?
So you're the new Press Secretary.
Take it, and I’ll throw in the horse.
Oh, and one last thing... Remember to avoid Mexican food.
It’s a bit dated, sir.
It does a really great job at hiding your problem areas.
I think it's riveting, sir.
Oh... you mean an Armani suit.
Medieval is the new black.
It makes you look a thousand years younger.
Fat? Surely you joust.
I know it feels heavy, but the mirror adds ten pounds.
It comes with a matching oil can.
It has an ironclad guarantee.
Yes sir, it is absolutely wrinkle free
I'm sorry, sir. That coupon expired during the Inquisition.
To offset the steel tariff I’ll give you a ten percent discount.
Its also available in rust.
So, you’re a schoolteacher.
A pair of magnetic cuff links and voila!
And I believe we have the matching codpiece in stock.
It's a real chic magnet, which reminds me, stay away from magnets.
It's a little stiff, but it wears like iron.
If you order now before the tariffs you save twenty-five percent.
It really makes you look tin.
Yes, I think that will be stunning, Madam Press Secretary!
You should have thought of that before you got dressed.
I wouldn't call it 'Retro' as much as I would 'Apocalypse  Now'.
If you buy now, you avoid the steel tariffs.
Of course you may have a little trouble getting through airport security.
One of our excellent old-world welders can let that out for you.
Cotton would be more breathable but would offer less protection.
As you can see this prototype for a new school uniform is the best solution for keeping our children safe.
If you meant pajamas why did you ask for knight wear?
You look at least six hundred years younger.
Yes, heavy metal is definitely making a comeback.
... and the alterations will be completed well in advance of your first day as Press Secretary.
No, Secretary Pruitt, it does not come in gold.
This one’s appropriate for a knight on the town.
You look absolutely magnetic!
You’ll find it particularly adept at deflecting the slings and arrow of outrageous fortune.
Between you and me, I'm really going to miss the swimsuit competition.
The old classics never go out of style.
You've got mail
I think it's perfect for submitting your report, Mr. Mueller.
That’s a perfect outfit for a knight out.
It’s guaranteed to survive lightning strikes even if you don’t.
This suit comes with two sets of Depends
No problem.  Our welder is in Tuesday.
I've found your sword, Sir. It's in caption contest #619.
This model includes Bluetooth and the Find My Armor app.
For the price.....It's a steel....
The tag says Easy Care but it makes a racket in the dryer.
You have to remember the mirror adds ten pounds.
So young lady, you say this is your first blind date since the #metoo movement began?
I would wear it untucked, sir.
You'll like the extra room when you pillage.
If this is out of your budget, we do have a sale on the emperor’s new clothes.
Yes, Madam First Lady, they are both strong choices, but this sends a subtler message
Gender fluid for sure.
Sure, we can spray paint your back with any uncaring message you like, Melania.
This should handle anything they throw at you
Ready to wash the cat sir
It's called a codpiece, President Trump.  And yes, we can make yours larger than Henry the 8th's.
Perfect for a knight on the town, don’t you think?
No, it doesn't come with a back-up camera.
The fit is perfect, sir, but I still wonder if you’re taking her dating profile too literally.
It's you. Whoever you are.
And it comes with an iron-clad guarantee.
It's definitely your strong suit.
You said, "appropriate for a Middle-Aged man."
I'm sorry sir, but two goats and one fat laying hen is the sale price
It also comes with a year supply of WD-40.
It’s what we recommend for the 2020 Presidental Election, Madame.
On Casual Fridays you can open the visor.
It's stainless steel so it goes with the refrigerator and dishwasher.
It's the last suit you'll ever need.
Surely you joust.
I guess this means I’m wearing the princess costume again, Sweetheart?
It also comes in green with 'I really don't care about the king, do u?' written on the back.
In my humble opinion,sir, you look a thousand years younger.
It's aluminum. You know, for summer.
I hope you have TSA Pre-check.
Yes, you'll be more magnetic.
The welder is here if you need any minor alterations.
Will this be cash or CHAAAAARGE?
If you only had a heart.
It’s of course both stain-resistant and wrinkle-free
I'm sure you'll be the knight to remember.
You can easily wear that during the day, then just add a shield  or sword for a more night time look.
Trust me, you're gonna slay 'em.
Its our new No Iron line.
It’s a French design with steel from Canada, made in Germany, for our London and US customers, and tariffs up the yin-yang.
It goes with your Under Armour, Sir.
Just monitor your liquids intake
Chick magnet, I daresay.
They will still know it's you Mr. President.
…And our automotive department will cover dents and dings, for the first year.
Oh, yes, Mr. Pruitt, I’d say it’s an excellent choice for flying coach.
And what's great is that you can wear it into your middle ages.
Of course it makes you LOOK brave, but how does it make you FEEL?
Another Hostile Takeover Sir?
And what are the groomsmen wearing?
Rust protection is extra.
It’s become increasingly popular in the  #MeToo era
Unfortunately we can't accept returns if thou dost recoil before thine enemy.
I Really Don't Care, Do U?
It’s been our best seller for as long as I can remember
Yes sir, this does make your hands look big.
Of course, we suggest that you allow yourself extra time for air travel.
We just got it off the rack.
Our rental fees are reasonable, but there is a $100 surcharge if it comes back with any dents, punctures, bloodstains or scorch marks.
It says zero tolerance with a touch of the quixotic.
Yes,it comes with a USB port.
Wow, look at those buns of steel
The codpiece can be tailored to the size of your ego.
It's just what you wanted: steely, yet quixotic.
I'm afraid we have to charge for alterations.
All the king's men are wearing it.
Yes, it does come in a matte finish. But, trust me, Sir, no Lady can resist a man in shining armor.
You look riveting.
It's perfect for a knight on the town.
I think wingtips would be a little much.
Does the gentleman wear Under Armour under armor?
Well! Don't we look ready for a knight on the town!
It really says 'hostile takeover' to me.
It is a very traditional cut, but you can always freshen it up with a bold pocket square.
These new school uniforms are marvellous. And NRA approved!"
The tailor can add rust protection for an additional $89.00.
And you’ll feel what it’s like to be called “ Sir” again.
For alterations we have a welder on call.
Would you care to see something with a little less structure?
Sir, I'm afraid that's no longer politically correct. We now say, "There is a 'Chinese American' in your armor."
...and it doesn't need ironing
...and, if you buy today; free undercoating.
Did you want the rustproofing with that?
Of course, farting can be problematic.
I think it makes you look quite chivalrous!
Melania, why not go with just the belt?
The 80s are back. The 1380s, to be exact.
It doesn't get any more retro than this
It's the last suit that you'll ever need!
Nothing says 'I'm ready to litigate' like plate armor.
I understand you are going to be joining the presidents legal team.
Not only is the mask breathable, you become a Wi-Fi Hotspot
Is this vintage enough for you?
We also have mail order.
I think you've nailed it, Melania.
Pleated!? I thought you said plated.
The fit depends on which side you"carry your lance", so to speak.
Perfect for a knight out.
So...how do you like our new Over Armour line?
We call it “dressed to kill,”  sir.
Does this make me look Middle-Aged?
Yes, Ma'am, it's the very latest in our "Me too" line of clothing.
You'll slay.
Excellent choice sir! Our welder will have the alterations ready by 4pm Friday.
This is from our new line for Middle Age men.
very bespoke sir
So, What's the occasion?
From our vintage collection.
Or you can soften the look by wearing the visor up.
Did you say you forgot your anniversary or her birthday?
We also have this suit in black, grey, or rust
Theres even an inside pocket for your cell phone
Alterations are down the hall.  Ask for "Smith."
Seriously, this suit takes hundreds of years off you."
It’s Giorgio Armourani...
Actually, this IS the relaxed fit.
My dear. I remember the days when a chastity belt would have been more than sufficient.
This should definitely get you a seat at the round table.
The pocket square can also be used as a cookie sheet.
And it’s just the thing for a knight on the town.
Not you sir?! Why surely you joust.
You should see what the bridesmaids have to wear.
They'll never know it's you, Joan.
The power suit is back.
To hell with Under Armor.
Truly the ultimate in power suits, wouldn’t you agree sir?
I'll check the instruction manual. Number one or number two?
This is the last one we have in stock. We mostly sold out four centuries ago.
No, I don't think it's too matchy, matchy.
Oh, you said Armani!?
I would wait until after the spring harvest and feasts before making any alterations.
And of course, it comes with our iron-clad guarantee.
Nothing errant or quixotic about looking your best.
And, it effortlessly goes from work to a knight out on the town.
....and there's a special pocket for your iPhone.
Cuffs?
I say we go with this one and call it a knight.
I do think it sets the appropriate tone for a new press secretary.
Not only does it fit well but it is included in our Pre-tariff Sale as well.
It's a steel.
It says gallant and chivalrous, but not afraid to go
medieval when necessary.
You can recycle it, too.

It's ideal for handling slings and arrows.
It’s what all the smart gentlemen in Washington are wearing these days.
Our most polished look this season, sir
It's the first suit designed exclusively for a Trump press secretary.
Too Much Irony
It's the top seller in our maille order catalogue.
Good luck with the divorce proceedings, sir.
This 23 piece suit is an excellent choice.
I'm sorry, sir. I obviously misunderstood what you meant by 'Fashionably Quixotic'!
Sir, it screams "large penis."
There's no pocket for my cell phone
I’m afraid it may clash.
It says "regal elegance" without saying "tyrant."
Keep in mind...the mirror adds ten pounds.
It’s a full metal jacket.
This suit is the best for your new role, Mr. Press Secretory
...and when does your appointment to the Trump Cabinet begin?
For a more polished look.
Is this for a particular battle or everyday use?
You don't look too evil. I'd say more mid-evil.
Yes, a smidge heavier than the tweed but much more durable.
Very slimming, sir, and it includes our iron-clad guarantee.
The visor comes off easily and it's great for straining pasta.
Not bad for off-the-rack.

This look is very ‘business casualty.’
Viagara use will void the warranty
That suit, Sir, is a steel.

Summer weight titanium is perfect for August battle season.
Heads will turn sir.
It's an outstanding fit, sir, but metal detectors may be an issue...
...and the suit comes with free altercations.
Yes, it's a little old-fashioned, but you'll get excellent cell phone reception.
Perhaps sir would like to try the relaxed fit?
It also comes in summer-weight aluminum.

I told you to go to the bathroom BEFORE you tried on the suit!
Will you be paying in sacks of gold or credit?

My only regret is that he never got around to visiting your mother.
He touched so many lives.
Well, that just leaves taxes.
You know, I can never define irony, but I know it when I see it.
I was hoping taxes would go first.
Well, I guess that just leaves taxes.
He lived everyday like it was your last.
I wonder if he saw himself coming.
All they’d say is that it was job-related.
I guess we can stop eating kale.
I guess his work finally caught up with him.
Well, he has no one to blame but himself for this.
I warned him not to run with that thing.
Well, at least he died doing what he loved
They did a nice job. He looks grim.
Well, he has no one to blame but himself.
I can’t believe Keith Richards outlived him.
Well, that leaves taxes.
So where does this leave us on the “till death do us part” thing?
Does this mean your mother will be living with us forever?
I always hoped that Taxes would be the first to go.
Suddenly everyone has only good things to say about him.
He died doing what he loved.
Then I said, "would it kill you to smile now and then?"
Amazon puts everyone out of business.
To think how many lives he touched.
He had so much death left in him.
Well, I guess we can start drinking and smoking again.
At least he died doing what he loved.
In spite of everything, he stayed grim right up until the end.
I was really hoping Taxes would go first...
I hear the new guy has a weed wacker.
I guess you can be too good at your job.
And that's when he said, 'Let me handle the N.R.A.'
I told him not to wear a hoodie in that neighborhood.
See Honey, irony is not dead.
No friends, depressing job, constant talk of death—how could we miss the warning signs?
He touched the lives of so many people.
Who knew he was allergic to nuts?
Now there's just taxes
Will you get out of that coffin and stop scaring the customers with that outfit; I'm trying to make a sale here.
He should have seen this coming
Well at least this is the last one of these we'll have to go to.
I wish he would have had time to stop by the White House first.
Life won’t be the same without him
Well then, you explain how it isn't a suicide.
I always thought he would be the last to go.
Then again, he always looked like death.
I wonder who will run the NRA now.
I guess what goes around really does come around.
The grim truth is he could dish it out but he couldn't take it.
He had so much death left in him.
Ok, now I feel old.
I hate to say it, but he brought it on himself.
The obit said he had no survivors.
He was a victim of his own success
I guess now it’s just taxes.
First God, now this.
I wish it had been taxes.
It may be a small crowd. So many of the people he knew are already dead.
Just think of all the lives he touched.
I’m just saying when it’s my turn please don’t bury me in my work clothes!
He, of all people, should have known not to answer the door.
He never saw himself coming.
All I said was, “would it kill you to call your mother once in awhile?”
Well, this is a game changer.
He could dish it out, but he couldn't take it.
Oh come on Harold! How could it not be suicide?
Unfortunately now all we have left are taxes.
Well he died doing what he loved
I think this means we can start smoking again.
Even he couldn't bear possibly another two years.
He looks like death. They really did a great job on him.
The undertaker is devastated.
He almost made it out unscythed.
I told him not to wear hoodies in rich white neighborhoods.
Ironically, it was the job that killed him.
I heard that he was texting while reaping.
Well, that leaves taxes.
Well I'll be, death does become him.
It's true. You reap what you sow.
Another White House departure
Bet he didn't see that one coming
I guess that leaves taxes.
They did a wonderful job. He never looked so grim.
I'll miss your brother, Bob, but not his sense of humor.
Too bad. He was in line to be the next White House communications director.
I wonder who came for him.
I've always told him this job will be the death of him.
I guess eventually you reap what you sow.
Was this your mother's only outfit?
Well, you have to appreciate the irony, at least...
Oh for Christ's sake, get out of bed, you're going to be late for work.
I wouldn't want to meet the guy who came for him.
Do you think it was the Russians?
No, that's just where he sleeps.
Try parting us now, asshole.
He's never looked more like himself.
No one has any job security any more.
Well this changes everything. I guess I can cancel my colonoscopy.
Well this is grim.
He was there at the end for so many.
I thought Pestilence gave a surprisingly moving eulogy.
It was a pre-existing condition
He brought it on himself.
Apparently it was a work-related fatality.
Tragic. I so wanted to have you meet him.
Yeah, but we still have taxes.
He went down swinging.
I wonder who showed up at HIS door?
He tried to go after Betty White.
Apparently he was texting-while-scything.
I heard they're having a hard time finding someone to deliver the eulogy.
At least he died doing something he loved.
I didn't even know he had a prostate.
We still got taxes.
He touched a lot of people.
I'm confused. Does this mean we're off the hook?
So I guess this just leaves taxes...
It's his happy place.
All we have to worry about now are taxes
His job finally caught up with him!
Since Death can't part us anymore, I'm calling my lawyer.
At least he went doing what he really loved.
Why couldn't it have been "Taxes"?
The only certain thing now is taxes.
He touched so many
Well, you reap what you reap.
Well, at least he died doing what he loved
Well it's official. Keith Richards is going to live forever.
Well he died doing what he loved
And to think just yesterday he was alive and reaping.
Somehow I never imagined the mustache.
Who’s gonna run Breitbart now?
Now I guess taxes are the only sure thing.
Just taxes, then?
I hear he took his own life.
Well I guess that leaves only taxes.
Whatever you do, don't sign the guest book.
I’m so glad we didn’t get to see him before he passed.
I guess that leaves taxes.
He brought this upon himself.
I would have expected a bigger turnout, considering all the lives he touched.
Talk about ironic...he choked on a lifesaver.
Well, I guess now it's just taxes.
It does seem a little redundant.
Life won’t be the same without him
So I said “no, after you.” Who thought he’d listen?
" I guess that only leaves taxes".
Is it ironic or a paradox? I get those mixed up.
Technically, he took his own life.
Oh, that's just great! Now we'll NEVER get Mitch McConnell out of the senate!
We are going to need a lot more for retirement than we planned.
Well, all that's left now would be taxes.
I guess it's just taxes now.
I forget. Is this ironic or paradoxical? Either way it's funny as hell.
It should've been taxes.
Never bring a scythe to a gun fight.
Trumpcare.
He was wonderful in that Swedish movie.
He died doing what he loved.
So that leaves just taxes, right?
Relax, it's his loser brother - The Grim Sleeper.
That's the last coffin we'll ever sell.
Great. Now the only sure thing is taxes.
I’m going to miss the obituaries.
Well, he certainly had it coming.
Mercy, we really are older than death.
My goodness Harold, I think I finally understand situational irony.
I didn’t think it would kill him to be nice for once.
I guess after the death of irony, this was predictable.
So, now it's just taxes.
They did a great job. He looks so dead.
So I guess it's only Taxes.
Worked himself to death, did he?
Who knew he had a peanut allergy.
Well, this leaves only taxes.
I'm sorry to say it, but he looks like Death warmed over.
Not too close, he may be bluffing.
I'm certain we'll still have to pay our taxes.
I bet he had a lot of skeletons in his closet.
I guess we're stuck with your mother.
If only he had been carrying a gun
His job finally caught up with him!
He was always dressed to kill
I guess the only thing we can count on now is taxes.
Life just won't be the same without him.
Well, I guess we should have saved more money for retirement. It looks like we’re gonna be here awhile.
He touched so many lives.
It's always the one you least expect to go.
I always thought taxes would go first.
Well, I guess that leaves us with taxes.
Does Taxes know?
I told him that job was a dead end.
Florida is going to get crowded
Well dear, so much for death do us part.
Nap time is over. Now, go get us some customers.
Turns out, he had a peanut allergy.
Why an open casket? He looks like hell.
Now who's going to put me out of my misery?
What are the odds? He died on April 15th.
So sad. He touched so many lives.
They''ll miss him down at the senior center.
I hate to say it, but he had it coming.
At least he went doing what he loved
He shouldn't have gone after Keith Richards.
Even in death, he looks like Death.
So now how much money do we need for retirement?
I thought taxes would go first.
I must've warned him a million times, "You're gonna reap what you sow honey."
I wonder who came for him.
He had all of our lives ahead of him.
There were so many more people that we should have introduced him to
I have to say... I'm feeling a lot more optimistic about our golden years.
Well Gene, it looks like we're stuck with each other forever.
Apparently you also reap what you reap.
I heard he wanted 'over my dead body' on his headstone.
No one ever thinks it can happen to them.
I heard it was sickle cell
If someone had to go, why couldn't it be taxes?
What will The New Yorker cartoonists do without him?
I used to flirt with him.
Not to sound disrespectful, but he had it coming.
He finally found himself.
He doesn't look as grim as I imagined.
He wanted me to come with him. I told him to go to hell.
He reaped what he sowed.
At least he died doing something he believed in.
He’s got only himself to blame for this.
I understand he left 7 billion survivors.
Well, we'll always have taxes.
My favorite memory was when he took your Aunt Bertha.
We should have gone for the reverse mortgage.
I guess the only certainty now is taxes.
At least Irony's still alive.
You know what this means...We'll outlive our savings.
Definitely an inside job.
Ironically, he didn't have life insurance.
Well, this can't be a good sign for the funeral business.
It seems like only yesterday I was at his door.
Say what you will about him, but he practiced what he preached.
I’d rather it’d been taxes
Finally, the death of irony.
At least one thing is certain . . . taxes.
Look, he's still wearing his NRA pin.
I always thought that he'd be there for us in our old age.
If it weren't 2018, this would be pretty surprising.
He was offered a White House position.
Quit complaining. Its the last one we have to attend....
Reaping is now done by smart phone, he couldn't adapt.
I mean, he must have seen it coming...
Pity, he had so much death left in him.
Well, this looks grim.
I suppose this just leaves taxes.
They say it was self-inflicted.
This certainly opens an existential can of worms.
Putin considered him a threat.
You were right...in this economy theres no such thing as job security.
My best memory of him was … well, right now
Well, I don't really know. Why ARE we grieving?
I guess this means we can smoke.
He worked himself to, well, you know.
So, now it's just taxes.
I can never tell, is this irony or poetic justice?
Seriously? Tide Pod?
Karma.
They say he died doing what he loved
I'm not surprised. He looked like death.
Can't say I'm surprised. He always looked like death.
That just leaves taxes I guess
Somehow I thought we’d be first.
I guess this means I'll never be rid of your mother.
Poor guy - those New Yorker cartoonists worked him to death
Did they have to make him look so grim?
Poor guy worked himself to death.
He kept working right up until the end.
I guess this means I can start eating red meat again?
If this is who I think it is, we can cancel our insurance.
I can do it myself, he always used to say.
First "God is dead" and now this!
I’ll bet he never saw this coming.
First it was, "God is dead." Now look.
Well, I guess we're stuck with each other for a while.
That's what you get for training your own replacement.
Get up, you're not fooling anyone.
He looks like hell.
You say ironic, I say redundant.
Any idea who did it?
I'm not sure what it means - but I think we'd better sign up for long term care insurance...
There's still taxes.
It was just too much for him when hell froze over.
You can't count on anything anymore.
Well, there goes our funeral business.
What's next...taxes?
Whatever you do, don't sign the guest book.
Looks like you're stuck with me now, Arthur
I know you’re not supposed to say it, but he really brought this on himself.
I hate wakes. It's like staring at death in the face.
He just couldn't find work-life balance.
So much reaping and so little to sow for it.
That job would kill anyone.
Does this mean we're stuck here?
You know, maybe I will go on that skydiving thing next week after all.
Let's hold off on mailing our tax returns.
The ironic part is that he died in the Living Room
He would have liked the irony.
I don't know about you, but I was kind of counting on "...till death do us part."
I assumed he was exempt.
Talk about ironic...he choked to death on a lifesaver.
You would think he'd seen it coming.
Let's just see what happens if we don't pay our taxes this year.
It may be a trick....you poke him.
He only has himself to blame.
He shouldn't have brought a scythe to a gun fight.
I hope this means we can start smoking again
Even the Grim Reaper has left the White House.
Well, this certainly changes our retirement plan.
Looks like we're stuck with your mother.
His last words were "I can't take another day of Trump".
Your father and I are concerned that this "goth thing" is getting a little out of hand, dear.
Karma’s a bitch, isn’t it!
They ruled it a suicide.
Well, at least irony isn't dead.
Apparently bested in an encounter with someone named Keith Richards.
I liked him in that Ingmar Bergman film.
Coroner said it was work-related.
Now I am convinced that Keith Richards will live forever.
At least he saw it coming.
Of course it's sad, but he died doing what he loved.
You think it'll never happen to you.
I guess that just leaves Taxes.
My guess is that he finally reaped what he sowed.
I guess now it’s just taxes.
Ok, now I feel old.
He was someone you could always count on.
Our last customer. Looks like we're finally out of business.
I always thought I'd go before he did.
Cancel the life insurance.
What goes around comes around.
You think he knew it was coming?
I’ve never been this close to death before.
I guess I picked the wrong time to open a funeral home.
Well, what do you know? Irony IS dead.
The Russians deny poisoning him.
I told him he should've forwarded that chain letter.
I always said he was working himself to death.
So then just taxes?
His obituary said we should make donations directly to the NRA.
This is going to tank Social Security.
His job finally got to him.
horrible job. why did they make him look so grim
He looks so life-like. They did a terrible job.
"You'll work yourself to death," I said. "Stop being ironic," he said.
Now the only thing certain is taxes.
Well, it looks like irony is alive and kicking.
Now what happens to that "until death do us part" clause?
He never should have taken that White House Communications Director job. He had a perfectly good career.
It was him or us, dear.
Well, honey, ‘Till Death Do Us Part’ is no longer on the table, let’s get a divorce
Great, now how are we gonna get rid of your mother?
I hope taxes are next.
Well, I guess that only leaves Taxes.
Now aren't you glad we went for the lifetime annuity?
I'm having a near death experience.
I heard the funeral director's retiring after this.
Let's hear it for the Second Amendment.
Don't gloat—the new guy might be worse.
Poor bastard, worked himself to death.
I guess now all we can count on is taxes.
What's with the high heels?
It's what he always wanted.
Well that’s a bit redundant, don’t you think?
They ruled it a suicide.
Sigh, I guess he reaped what he sowed.
So sad. Who will play Bannon now?
So much for "'Til death do us part"
He never truly lived.
I never expected him to go first.
I heard it was a murder-suicide.
So he finally did reap what he sowed.
This is a game changer.
Oh well, what goes around comes around.
It almost looks like he's just reaping.
That just leaves taxes.
You can get up now. They’re not gonna ban assault weapons.
At least he died doing something he loved.
I warned him not to go after Keith Richards.
He says it "gets him in the zone"
That reminds me, our taxes are due.
I think the irony was lost on him.
Apparently you do reap what you sow.
So who came for HIM?
Karma.
If this means we're going to live forever, I want a divorce.
That 401(k) money is going to have to last us a lot longer than we thought.
Well, you reap what you reap.
I told you all it took was a good guy with a gun.
I always hoped taxes would be the first to go
Does this mean I'm stuck with you forever?
Rats. It looks like your mother's going to be with us for quite a while.
What a year Murray--first a tax break, now this!
Even he didn’t see himself coming!
He loved his job, but he worked himself to death.
Now we'll never get off the wait list for senior housing.
Apparently the only thing certain in life now is taxes.
They should have done a closed casket, he looks like death!
They say he took his own life.
He was so full of death.
He had so much left to take.
Thank God. The New Yorker can't exploit him anymore.
What do you mean, "you don't see the irony."?
I wonder if he saw it coming.
He used to say irony was dead.
He was watching Fox and Friends.
He touched a lot of lives.
He died of supernatural causes.
Oh boy, I guess the only thing certain now is taxes.
Once 'Saturday Night Live' compared him to Steve Bannon, his spirit wasn’t in it anymore.
He had a lasting impact on everyone he met.
I told him he was messing with the wrong old lady.
If you're ever going to run with the bulls, now would be the time.
That’s a tough way to meet your quota!
Logistically, this is a nightmare.
Does this mean I'm stuck with you for eternity?
You never think it can happen to you...
Well this is certainly a game changer.
You know, I think death becomes him.
That'll teach you to skulk around our retirement home.
Life just won't be the same without him.
He will be missed by cartoonists.
The only thing for certain now is taxes.
It's been a rough year for everyone.
You're not fooling anyone.
how was I supposed to know he was allergic to peanuts??
I think it's safe to start drinking again.
Who's grim now?
This IS a bad flu season.
Now all we have to worry about are taxes.
You're not fooling anyone.
Let's go skydiving after all.
It becomes him.
Ain’t payback a bitch.
Well, at least irony isn't dead.
I'll be going on the bacon and ice cream diet. What about you?
Make sure they lock the casket.
Well, there's a job opening. I heard they're working with a skeleton crew.
I heard it was sickle cell
The worst part about it is that he never really lived.
Yes, we're sure it's 'comfy', but could you show us something less pricey.
Oh, damn. Why couldn't it have been taxes?
He let himself go.
You think this will lower premiums?
I guess the only thing certain now are Taxes!
He really should have seen this one coming.
If this doesn't bankrupt Social Security, nothing will.
Death runs in his family
I always knew his work would catch up with him.
I hope he’s an only child.
I hear it was the Russians.
I guess you could say it’s death imitating art.
He was doing OK until the grimmer reaper came to visit.
Well now I'm only certain about taxes.
That seems redundant.
They say he never saw it coming.
It’s importat to remember he died doing what he loved.
Yeah, but we still have taxes.
I heard it was self-inflicted.
I'm guessing he would have seen the irony in this.
I knew that job would end up killing him.
Who knew he had orange hair?
The mandatory retirement rules are really getting strict.
I bet that was a surprise.
He should have seen this coming
He brought it upon himeslf
Let's hope taxes are next.
I guess I can cancel that life insurance policy.
The flu season was much worse than I thought.
Think we should still pay our taxes?
I told you he looked like death when I last saw him.
Worst flu season ever.
Well, let's hope taxes go next.
You never think it'll happen to you.
So I’m thinking that our reverse mortgage was a bad idea.
He touched a lot of people.
I told him not to take his work home with him
Ya reap what ya sow.
He was his own worst enemy.
It was sickle cell.
He never saw himself coming.
Think he'll Make Hell Great Again?
I guess that just leaves Taxes.
‘Well, I guess you really do reap what you sow’
Oh god, does this mean your mother is going to live forever?
I never had a chance to meet him.
I'd have preferred if it was taxes.
All that's left now is taxes.
This still leaves taxes
He looks so peaceful...Death really becomes him.
I hear his replacement looks like "death warmed over".
How long do we have to stay married now, Henry?
I never knew he wore glasses.
They say it was his job that killed him.
And I thought you had a dead end job
Never saw him eat a salad.
It’s the actuaries I really feel sorry for.
Now, THIS is what they mean by "died unexpectedly".
Does this mean we have to stay married forever?
He brought this upon himself.
I guess it was a good thing we forgot to clear the ice from our front steps.
I always get him and Father Time mixed up.
I'm going to have a cigarette.
I know it should make me question the existential ramifications for the concept of mortality, but mostly I'm just waiting for them to bring out the hors d'oeuvres.
'Well, Herb, I guess we can ease back on the bucket list.'
One down, Taxes to go.
They say if Wayne LaPierre kisses him he'll wake up.
I always thought we'd go before him.
What an oxymoron.
So who’s going to come after your mother now?
Now the only certain thing is taxes.
The police ruled it a suicide.
I never appreciated irony before.
Karma's a bitch.
Oh well, I guess that will be our last customer.
He looks as dead as he did when he was alive.
Well, we still have taxes.
It seems kind of redundant.
Does this make us grim weepers?
The job just gets to you in the end, I guess!
Well, we've still got taxes.
I guess the only thing certain now are Taxes!
Well, I guess you reap what you reap.
He heaved a scythe, and then he was gone.
Seems redundant, don’t you think.
Until now our marriage only seemed endless.
He went down swinging.
Call it Karma.
Work got the better of him.
I imagine he brought it upon himself.
Well, I guess we only have to worry about Taxes now.
You never think it's going to be you.
He seemed like an “always the reaper, never the reaped” kind of guy.
I don't know dear. Is it irony or paradox?
I can see how comfortable it is, but do you have anything more in our price range?
Peaceful? He looks like death warmed over to me.
A bit self-serving, don’t you think?
I guess his work finally caught up with him.
And what was the cause of death?
Well, this is the last time I go to a funeral.
Well, of course it had to be a suicide.
They did such a great job. He looks every bit as dead as he did last time we saw him.
Looks like Trump scares the life out of everyone...
So how are we going to sell the rest of these caskets?
Well I guess its just taxes then.
Worst flu season ever.
On the other hand, I see an up side for us in this.
Your sister is such a drama queen.
Well, this leaves only taxes.
Serves him right.
He was a victim of his own success
He resigned?
Well, I'm still certain about taxes.
I guess only taxes are certain.
The NRA just lost their biggest fan.
He loved that outfit.
How do we know he's dead?
I warned him. Live by the scythe; die by the scythe.
I never liked him.
So, donuts for dinner?
Now, nothing's certain but taxes.
Does this mean “Till Death Do Us Part” is off the table?
So I wonder who came for him?
Nice try, but you're not fooling the IRS.
OMG, Does this mean Trump is going to live forever?
Serves him right.
So are we like immortal now or what?
You live by the scythe, you die by the scythe.
We didn't know about the peanut allergy.
It turns out a scythe is no match for an AR-15.
He always said this job would be the death of him.
That’s my Donny... Always dressed to kill!
They did a beautiful job. He looks so deathlike.
The scythe swings both ways.
I always told him, if he didn’t slow down he was going to work himself to death.
They say it was self-inflicted.
Seems a little self-indulgent.
Poetic justice.
I'll tell you what this means Marge.... we can go back to eating whatever we want and drop our gym membership.
And never took a holiday.
No, he's not dead - he's just on his Death bed.
He must have seen this coming.
Don't get too close... it could be a trap.
They're calling it a suicide.
Now there's just taxes
What goes around comes around.
Life finally caught up with him.
He brought it on himself.
Well, it looks like he reaped what he reaped.
I told you he wouldn't get through his first term.
You reap what you sow. Still pretty grim.
He let his job get to him.
"Let's buy a funeral home," you said. "Everyone needs a funeral," you said. Nice one, Harry...
He took the early retirement package.
I'll tell you what this means, Efraim, we're stuck with each other for eternity.
He’s always been a do-it-yourselfer.
Now if we could just do something about taxes.
Harold always did like dressing for the occasion.
How can you tell?
His mother always told him not to run with that thing.
He butt-dialed his own number by mistake.
He certainly lived death to the fullest.
He was always complaining that he looked like death.
Thank you for not repairing that top step.
The only certain thing left in the world now is taxes.
I think I will go skydiving after all.
He wanted his funeral to be a celebration of death.
Now social security is really screwed.
Now the only thing certain left is taxes.
So, what - now it's just taxes?
This is going to be a long marriage.
They really captured his joie de mort.
This isn't going to help the Social Security funding deficit
It was either me or him, dear.
They did a great job, Death really becomes him.
He touched so many, I expected a bigger crowd.
This makes me question everything-beginning with our reverse mortgage.
Well at least he’ll know some people there.
That was easier than I thought, Harold. Now onto the IRS...
I heard Corporate gave him the ax
If you think Florida is overpopulated now, just wait.
Maybe this will be his last New Yorker appearance.
I rarely say this, but death becomes him.
This materially effects our retirement fund calculation.
So, what parts us now?
I never liked him.
I always thought we would go first
I can’t believe none of the family showed up.
Do we still have to pay taxes?
Why couldn't he have died when we were in our prime?
He said the job was killing him.
Well I guess this leaves us with only taxes.
Let’s grab a pack of cigarettes on the way home.
Well, that just leaves taxes.
You sow. You reap. And in the end what does it get you?
Does this mean we can get the deposits back on our plots?
George, I don’t care what anyone says, I think death becomes him.
Now all we have to do is get rid of taxes.
We’re fucked.
First funeral I’ve ever attended that made me contemplate my own immortality.
He was always his own worst enemy.
First taxes, now him.
Well this is grim.
Betty White challenged him to mortal combat.
You never think it'll happen to you.
He always said the job was killing him.
Is it too much to hope that taxes will be next?
Grab the scythe and let's pay Taxes a visit.
They did a wonderful job - he doesn't look life-like at all!
How will they ever keep a lid on this?
No Stan, I don’t think this means we’re off the hook.
I guess we can cancel our life insurance.
Gosh, you really do reap what you sow.
Now what? Just taxes?
Henry, if this means we’re going to live forever I’m going to kill myself.
I would have expected taxes to go first.
Now I’m not so certain about taxes either.
After the 2016 election we should have seen this coming.
The undertakers can't be happy about this development.
I'm really not looking forward to seeing his family
Social Security's definitely in trouble now!
I guess this means Keith Richards will live forever.
He looks very lifelike
He always had a great sense of irony.
Makes you wonder who came for him?
I thought he would outlive all of us!
When you're in HR as long as he was, you're going to make enemies.
Normally I'm against suicide.
Well, what did he expect, wearing a hoodie near the precinct house?
Does this mean we should have saved more for retirement?
We should have saved more for retirement.
I was really hoping Taxes would go first...
I bet he didn't see it coming.
Well, the only sure thing left is taxes.
I'm just glad he went doing what he loved.
Its the new plan for cutting Medicare.
He was so full of life. You know, for Death.
I've heard he never took a holiday.
No, what's ironic is that it's tax season too.
Once they got rid of taxes on the rich, this was inevitable.
That's Harry all right -- Always "dressed to kill."
I suppose this explains the new tax bill.
His obituary said he was preceded in death by everybody.
You promised us, "till death do us part"... Larry, I want a divorce.
Hey -- you reap what you sow.
He died as he lived.
Don’t get up. We’re not staying.
I'm hardly surprised. He looked like death the last time I saw him.
So sad. Who will lead the alt-right now?
And they say that irony is dead.
How odd that he died while doing his taxes.
It was sickle cell.
Who knew that abolishing the NRA would have such an immediate effect on him.
Well this seems redundant.
Who knew your mother had a sense of humor?
They say he never saw it coming.
He had his scythe, but I had a gun.
Looks like Aunt Edna's going be living with us a long time, Frank!
I told you it wouldn't fit.
I always thought he would be the last to go.
They're saying it was self-inflicted.
It was him or us.
Irony is dead as well
Maybe he didn’t meet his targets.
Who knew Death was allergic to shellfish?
Wow… That's what I call dedication!
I wonder if Mrs Death will remarry
Well, there is still taxes.
Just goes to show that you reap what you sow.
He ran into a good guy with a scythe.
If you can't reap them, join them.
Yes, Robert, I'm pretty sure he saw it coming.
I agree, Death becomes himself.
So irony isn't dead after all.
Well that sucks. I was counting on that ‘death do us part’ thing.
They really did a nice job. He looks so natural and grim.
I told him to use the lawnmower instead of that damn scythe.
I guess what goes around, comes around.
I just told the morticion to dress your mother according to her true personality.
Now I'm sure that smoking can kill anybody
It should've been taxes.
Relax Gladys. It was him or us.
Now what?" "Well, I always wanted to try skydiving.
We'll always have taxes...
This does complicate our retirement planning.
He always said his work would be the death of him.
I never liked his gallows humor.
At his age, he should have gotten the flu shot.
Hard to believe they could botch a hip replacement on him.
So your mother died at a costume party?
I guess that’s a grim wrapper.
I suppose now we'll have to rely on the NRA.
He was denied life insurance because of a preexisting condition .
They did a nice job, so death-like.
We better check the retirement account. I don't think we planned for this.
Now that you mention it, he does look rather grim.
We’re gonna need a bigger retirement.
Why couldn’t this have happened when I was still young?
I can't get over the redundancy.
Well, on the plus side, I guess we can cancel our life insurance.
I heard it was self-inflicted.
They say he left no survivors.
On second thought, I do want a divorce.
He always did dress to kill
Wish they’d wipe that grim off his face!
Does this mean we're going to be married forever?
He was always a do-it-yourselfer.
We warned him not wear a hoodie to a Trump rally.
Does this mean we're stuck with each other forever?
And we always thought he'd be the last to go.
Henry, I want a divorce.
Bet he never saw That coming.
He killed himself.
Among so many achievements, bubonic plague was the standout for me.
Well isn't this just great. Who is going to come for Aunt Edna now?
So ‘til when do us part, now?
It's part of his Customer Experience training.
It's so sad, his work finally got the better of him, but still, what a legacy.
Well, I guess this is the last funeral we'll ever have to attend.
Wow. We're going to have way too much time on our hands.
This comes as a complete surprise. But then again, he always did.
Surprising he went with the open casket.
Melvin, stop being dramatic. So what, you're 50! Come back to your party or you'll give your mother a stroke.
They did a good job, he looks so unnatural.
Well, that's the last casket we'll be selling for a while.
Well, whattaya know. He found a way out of his Mueller subpoena after all.
Taxes won in the end.
Do you think he saw it coming?
Great - what will we sit around waiting for now?
When you said you had beaten death, I didn't think you meant literally
So... this is life after Death?
He brought it on himself, you know.
Death really becomes him
He touched so many
Talk about double negatives!
He seems to have worked himself to death.
Seems redundant.
What's next. No taxes?
It looks as if the only certainty now is - taxes.
I thought he'd look grimmer.
I think I’ll cancel my colonoscopy.
Well, we can't say he didn't see it coming.
It was either him or me.
Merv, we said. Be a doctor or a lawyer, we said. But no, he had to major in irony.
Turns out he was an organ donor
I told Bob he was tempting fate when he picked this Halloween costume.
looks just like him
He really buried himself in his work.
It’s going to be a hell of a eulogy.
So karma is real.
Gosh, I guess that just leaves taxes...
I hear he's being replaced by an even worse fate.
I guess the job finally caught up with him
I guess we will have to work on our marriage
Well, maybe it's NOT too late to get another dog!
Now, what about taxes?
I loved him in that Bergman film.
We call this model The Grim Sleeper.
Well, Death did his part.
At least he went out doing what he loved most.
Karma's a bitch.
Who said irony is dead?
That reminds me, I need to do my taxes.
He made a grave error.
Well, yes, I guess I should have believed him when he said he had a "severe" allergy to peanuts. But he shouldn't have used air quotes.
He was such a big Ingmar Bergman fan
Without him I guess the only thing that's certain now is taxes.
Now you know what it feels like.
I don't buy it. Check his pulse.
I warned him not to cross Putin.
How much do we have in retirement again?
This may be good news for us.
I guess we do need that long term care insurance.
Well, he knocked on the wrong door this time.
I think its time to get out of the mortuary business.
I tried to warn him about your mother.
They've done a beautiful job--he really looks dead.
Well, he certainly had it coming.
Great. Now I'll be stuck with you forever.
Wow, he looks like death warmed over.
He always complained that work would be the death of him.
I always thought we’d go first.
Death really does become him.
Now all we have left is taxes.
What will cartoonists do now?
It was the job that killed him.
I thought the service was kind of grim.
Hate to say it but he looks like hell.
Well, there goes the Death Penalty.
Stop telling people he was from my side of the family.
His lifestyle finally caught up to him.
They said nothing could kill him. Then, he ate a tide pod.
So the last thing he said to me was"Hold my beer and watch this"!
I think we should take this 'Time's Up' movement more seriously.
Well that's ironic
I guess we shouldn't have sold our condo in Florida
I told you that he shouldn't have gone to work in the Trump White House....
I told him he was working himself to death.
Hey, he had a good run, but it was time to step aside and let the NRA take over.
Now, we'll see his tax return.
I wanted him to be a doctor.
Does this mean we can cancel our life insurance?
She did love to accessorize.
This is going to be very bad for business
Do you think it was suicide?
Somehow he looks less grim.
He promised he'd make it to my funeral, so I thought I'd show up to his.
I guess he finally caught up with himself.
I hope the taxman goes next.
They did a great job, he almost looks normal.
It's Wayne LaPierre
You know what, death really does become him.
I heard he worked himself to death.
He was dying to know how it felt.
It's amazing how death-like he still looks.
I'm told his successor will merely tweet.
I knew this would happen if I let you dress mother.
If we're lucky, taxes are next.
He won't be needing that where he's going
He always did like irony.
Never felt so close to death before
Surprised they went with the open casket.
About those vows...
He had it coming.
How many times did I say "Don't run with your scythe"?
Don't get too close... it could be a trap.
Death became him.
Does this mean I don’t have to quit smoking?
Could taxes be next?
I warned him not to bring work home.
Apparently, he worked himself to death.
One down. Just Taxes to go.
Now it’s time to take on taxes.
Well, that’s grim.
Well, that's the final irony.
Now if we could only get rid of taxes.
QUIT NAPPING AND GET BACK TO WORK, THESE CASKETS AIN'T GONNA FILL THEMSELVES.
At least he died doing what he loved.
Term limits. Who knew?
Now all we have to look forward to is taxes.
Looks like his past finally caught up with him.
The mortuary did a good job. He looks so death-like.
It wouldn't be so sad if Trump weren't President.
I think it just finally got to him.
I'd say he had it coming to him.
So I guess we're stuck here til they find a replacement.
He was only cheating himself.
Wow! That can't be good for the funeral business.
No wonder your mother is still around to annoy us.
Seems kind of redundant to me.
Well that's that. Now all we've got to be certain about is taxes.
Could this mean the end of taxes too?
Oh My God...He looked better on SNL!
They say he died at work
I don’t care, I still want a selfie.
Looks like he finally reaped what he sowed
I guess the job got to him.
I can never tell, is this considered irony or sarcasm?
What kills me is paying all those useless life insurance premiums.
I guess we taught that son of a bitch not to knock on OUR door.
At our age, we attend a lot of funerals, but I really didn't expect to be around for this one.
This is the rare occasion when the term 'ironic' would be used correctly.
“Well, I guess that now, nothing is certain but taxes.
He reaped as he sowed. Grimly.
Looks like we can cancel our life insurance.
He was his own worst enemy.
Do you think he appreciates the irony?
Now THAT's a game-changer.
Yes, he really does look like death warmed over.
Natural? I think he looks like Death warmed over.
It's a shame. He had so much to live for.
You never think it is going to happen to you.
He came to take me away, but I sold him on our Simply Celestial Casket package.
Well, Social Security just became insolvent.
The dead flowers from his work were a nice touch.
Do you think it was your meatloaf?
Looks just like Steve Bannon...
They say it was the worst flu season in years.
Truly unique. He died of overkill.
It’s a shame, I wanted to introduce him to your ex-wife.
If he's gone for good, I wish we were younger.
He doesn't look so grim now, does he?
What will do us part now?
Oh, Goodness! No wonder he wore that hoodie.
You know things are bad when he calls it quits.
Now the only thing certain is taxes.
time to get up, you're gonna be late for work.
I told him that job would be the death of him.
He touched so many deaths.
I wonder how he did it?
I understand the funeral parlor comped him the casket.
I think he's still asleep. He's had a busy year being the NRA mascot
Well, he finally caught up with himself.
Well, at least we can still be sure of taxes.
Another change in the Administration.
Now, nothing's certain but taxes.
That’s why I always get a flu shot.
This is what happens when you spend your life working the graveyard shift.
The mortician really captured Dad's essence.
He lived everyday like it was his last.
You couldn't have done this when we were 30?
It's tragic. There's still so much more grim to reap.
And they said irony was dead.
They say it was really unexpected
I can't believe they didn't put him in a nice suit. I mean he wore this every day.
I wonder who gave him the news.
Touché!
I thought you'd go before me, Sam. Now, we'll never know.
I just never imagined that he'd go first.
As if I didn't look death in the face enough already...
I guess the only sure thing now is taxes.
Unbelievable. I wonder if Taxes has heard.
Now that's just overkill.
Uncle Charlie always did have a dark sense of humor
I hear he didn't feel authentic not having tried it himself.
He always said it was an occupational hazard.
They didn’t quite capture his joie de vivre.
He was my ride home.
Who do you think came for him?
still gotta deal with taxes...
Does this mean irony is dead, too?
His HMO said he was fine
Who decided to bury him in his work clothes?
We should have bought that lifetime annuity when we had the chance.
I'm never eating kale again.
Well, he reaped what he sowed.
Maybe the phrase should be "you reap what you reap."
So are taxes next?
This is horrible timing, your mother's not dead yet.
I guess there’s nothing certain anymore.
This just goes to show that you reap what you sow.
He looks a little more grim than usual....
Looks like he reaped what he sowed
As they say..."what goes around comes around."
Now we're definitely going to outlive our money.
Still a drama queen.
And they say irony is dead.
This could be very bad for business.
Looks like business will be slow for a while.
I thought he'd grow out of his goth phase.
They're calling it a suicide.
His eulogy is gong to take forever.
They did a good job...he looks so dead.
One visit to the White House. That's all it took.
He lived a full death...
Now if we can just get rid of taxes.
We need to sell our life insurance policies before word gets out.
Yes, suicide is tragic. But he died doing what he loved most.
We always thought he'd be the last to go.
I wonder if Breitbart will survive without him?
I hate tautology
That's some ironic shit, right there.
Life finally caught up with him.
He didn't see it coming.
He loved a good funeral.
I understand it was a suicide.
Now the only thing for sure is taxes.
Marjorie kept her sense of humor to the end.
I guess that this proves that you do reap what you sow.
I guess he took a selfie.
He was cutting coroners.
It's a shame, he was so good in the Ingmar Bergman movie.
Surely, he saw this coming.
This is a game changer.
Falling asleep on the job again?
I wonder where that leaves us now?
First God and now Death, who's next?
It costs more, but the scythe adds some je ne sais quoi.
I’ll never understand why he just didn’t use a lawn mower.
He wanted to be buried in a suit but all I could find was his Halloween costume.
You know we dated briefly in college.
We’re screwed.
Well, at least we can still count on taxes.
Another victim of automation.
He just asked about you last week
So, what other things could do us part?
He was in my kitchen and Alexa started laughing...
Only taxes remain now
Death can't do us apart anymore.
Does this mean I will be married to you forever?
I heard he worked himself to death.
If only he'd had a gun...
They say he took his own life.
Rumor is it was self-inflicted
I guess we have time to spend the kids’ inheritance.
Just think, had it not killed him it would have made him stronger.
Suicide. But he died doing what he loved.
They say he left everything to Chance.
Now, that's Karma.
I told him not to take his work home.
They say his job killed him.
I'd say he's had it coming for a very long time.
Suicide, obviously.
Looks like you won't be needing that cardiac by-pass surgery.
I just hope he was wearing clean underwear...
I keep expecting him to sit up and be dead.
Yes, death does become him
As they say, you reap what you sow.
Well, there goes ‘til death do us part.
Redundant.
Yeah, we made a bundle on the sale of this casket, but I still say our business is in trouble.
Still, he wasn't our worst president.
He touched billions.
Overaccessorized - as usual.
He really worked himself to death.
Now he is the grim sleeper.
He finally reaped what he sowed.
I want a divorce.
Well I guess pigs can fly now too.
I guess there may be rest for the wicked after all!
I guess he has a lot of angry people waiting for him.
At least he died doing what he loved most.
I'm surprised there aren't more people here.
It's amazing what they can do with makeup - he looks so death-like.
He reaped what he reaped.
I told him he was working too hard.
Getting him in there was quite an undertaking.
We won.
Maybe we'll get lucky with taxes, too.
Now that's irony!
They say there is nothing worse than outliving your child but I'm oddly ok with this
I guess it's just taxes we can be sure of now.
'Well Margaret, we're going to need to revisit our marriage vows.'
Well, we reap what we reap.
Apparently, he worked himself to death.
Oh man, now we are really never getting rid of your mother
I always thought that it'd be taxes.
Cancel the life insurance and take the reverse mortgage.
Who the hell parts us now?
Kudos to the mortician for getting the grim expression off his face.
Apparently, irony isn't dead after all.
I always told him his line of work was killing him.
I would never have believed it... Your Mother actually outlived him!
Well he can’t sleep out here. I’ll go make up the daybed.
John, you have to absolutely promise me you won't use this mortician if I go first.
Honey. When we said you could be whatever you want, we meant like a doctor, or an astronaut...
No, just taking a quick nippity nap before heading back to work.
Well, they did a beautiful job. He doesn’t look a day older than the 15th century.
I warned you not to mess with us.
Now what?
Sickle cell, apparently...
Let's cancel our life insurance policy.
I don't like the looks of this Harold. Who's going to put us out of our misery now?
I wish this happened when I was 25. Now I'll be old forever.
This is how I always pictured death.
So you DO reap what you sow.
I told him his job was killing him.
Well - that's pretty grim . . .
I'll miss Mr. Gallagher's quirky sense of humor.
I can't help wondering who came for him
With the political climate, can you blame him?
I thought this was Jim Reaper's funeral.
He looks good. Grim, but good.
He said, he likes to try them out before the day starts.
I guess this means no more Grim Reaper caption contests
Oh that reminds me - don't forget to bury me with my 7-iron
Well now what?
They are expecting a large turn out for this one
Does it mean that we are out of business now?
Remind me to cancel our life insurance policies.
I guess the job got to him.
I told him to buy a lawn mower.
He worked full-time, right up to the end!
Our retirement years just got longer.
I told him this would happen if he kept taking his work home with him.
Must have been suicide
You know what they say, Harold...You reap what you sow.
Yes, we all see the irony, Henry...
Thankfully he never got around to making a succession plan.
They say he had a death wish.
Gosh, Harvey, I guess you really do reap what you sow.
Well, I guess it's true that you only reap what you sow.
Now, that's a scythe for sore eyes.
Now how will we get out of here?
I told you we would regret buying life insurance.
I guess now we just wait for Bannon.
He died like he lived.
He was walking toward me muttering something when he slipped on a banana peel.
At least we still have taxes
Well, you sow what you reap.
I bet he didn't see it coming.
They did a really good job. He looks so death like.
So... this is life after Death?
He was always a little obsessed with death...
So what is the past tense? "Reaped?" "Reapt?"
Looks like a cheap trick to me, Herb. If he makes a move, slam the lid and run for it!
I don't know. It just seems redundant.
Really? Black lipstick?
The kids are not going to be happy.
You have to admit, it suits him.
Now all we have left is taxes.
Our long term care insurance isn’t going to like this.
And I thought he'd bury us all...
He never visited.
Seems a bit of a busman's holiday to me.
I thought he'd be the last one let go by the White House.
I heard the NRA found his replacement in a matter of minutes.
He took the election results pretty hard.
At least he finally found himself.
How will our retirement account last for eternity?
Does this mean I can start smoking again?
You have to admit, he touched millions of lives.
People are saying he worked himself to death.
They did a great job putting your mother in her favorite outfit.
The note said he just couldn't live with himself.
I've never seen him looking so grim.
Never drink and scythe.
Under the circumstances, I guess it has to be suicide.
He does not look as grim in there
Didn't see that coming.
I guess it's true - you reap what you sow
He looks strangely lifelike.
Worst case scenario: We live forever and Trump becomes president for life.
You reap what you sow.
Well, he had a good run.
He always did have the right clothes for every occasion.
For years, he lifted a lot of peoples' spirits.
As soon as your nap is over, that's Seymour's spot
Did they have to make him look so grim?
I guess a divorce is now our only way out.
Death really does become him.
Live by the scythe, die by the scythe.
I never though I'd live to see it. Now I guess we all will...
I can't tell you how many times I told him, "Look before you reap."
He doesn't look grim at all. Kind of peaceful.
The only thing certain is death and... Wait, do we still have to pay taxes?
You reap what you sow, apparently.
He died like he lived—dead.
Soooo, I guess I've got no excuse NOT to try skydiving now.
Goodbye social security.
He always said his job was going to be the death of him.
To hell with gluten free.
He did this to himself.
At least that's one less thing to worry about.
Why were we named next-of-kin?
So does this mean we’re off the hook?
Does this mean your mother will be with us forever?
He never did find that work/life balance
He wanted cremation, but we felt he'd look like death warmed over.
He looks much grimmer in real life.
I've never seen him looking so grim.
He looks so grim and peaceful.
Now do you understand the meaning of the word “irony”?
I suppose Taxes with be next.
Such a shock. I never dreamed he'd go first.
You know, it is ironic.
I guess we can finally try hang-gliding.
I was actually counting on him
He looks just like he did when he was alive.
Does this mean we can finally cancel our term life policy?
Don't even think of burying me in my work uniform.
I can't imagine he saw this coming.
I can't believe he slipped on a banana peel.
Ooh, the irony. Right? Is this irony?
There’s evidently a bidding war for his business. I hear its down to big tobacco and the gun manufacturers.
Death really becomes him
Well, this was unforeseen.
He was waiting for Godot.
Hank, I was going to just wait this thing out, but given the circumstances... I want a divorce.
I heard it was from unnatural causes.
He wants to get a better feel for the customer experience.
...and I was so looking forward to widowhood.
Well, there goes the mortuary business.
He loved irony.
He mumbled something about too many damn people on earth now and not being able to keep up.
Now he knows what it feels like!
Does this count as "Death do us part?"
I don’t care what they say. It HAD to be suicide
Remember how you worried we would outlive our savings?
I hear the prime suspect is Mrs. Reaper.
Don’t you dare bury ME in a hoodie!
Well, I guess the only thing in life that's sure now is taxes.
He met his match.
Well, I guess our lifetime annuity was a good choice.
To be frank, he hadn't looked well for some time.
I suppose it's just taxes now, for eternity.
I guess that what goes around actually does come around.
Oof, he looks like Death.
We're really stuck here now, aren't we.
You know, he just looks like hell.
No one ever thinks they're next.
Now that death can't save us, I guess we'll have to vote.
He was such a thoughtful boy...always around when someone wasn't feeling well...
Bergman devotee, I see.
They did a great job; he looks so...death-like.
I always thought we would go first
Who knew — John Donne was right.
It’s the third time we’ve caught him sleeping on the job.
He looks so life-like.
Yes, George, you might very well say 'Death becomes him'.
Can't say I'm impressed with the mortician. He looks so lifelike.
Well, that's a scythe for sore eyes.
In the end, he succumbed to irony.
I know the other reapers can be mean, but you need to get out of bed and get to school.
Its been a rough flu season.
I warned him my meatloaf was to die for. "Just one little bite" he says..
Well where else do you think he would nap?
Your side of the family is always so dramatic.....
Well, that explains the open casket.
Death becomes her.
Do we still have to do our taxes?
Too bad he's a twin.
His wife is just be scythe herself.
Poor guy, he never saw it coming
This all seems redundant.
I love karma.
How long did that fellow say our money would last?
The irony is killing me.
Didn't see that coming.
A hoodie and a scythe. Which gang is that again?
Looks like overkill to me!
Wonder what killed him!
He was never the same after that Monty Python movie.
See what happens when you take your work home with you, Earl?
Eulogy was probably the greatest challenge.
He lived a grim life.
Maybe I'll wait to file those taxes.
So are taxes next?
Does this mean we'll be married forever?
I knew your side of the family was evil.
We even outlived him? God, we're old.
I suppose this means your mother will always live with us.
'I've really got to hand it to the undertaker - he looks absolutely death-like.'
Hah – he finally reaped what he sowed!
Now, we'll never rest in peace.
So I guess Keith Richards won't ever die.
He just laughed when I told him your rhubarb pie would be the death of him.
Irony is dead
The lipstick is a nice touch, but I would have gone with a darker pink.
This is so meta, Harold.
It was him or us.
He dug his own grave.
Whew, that's a scythe of relief.
No. It’s a scythe. A sickle has a short handle.
They did a good job. He looks like himself warmed-over.
I guess all that is certain in our lives now is taxes.
I should have salted that icy patch at my door.
Retirement proved fatal for him.
Suddenly, I'm less worried about your angina.
Honey, I had to take him out. He was comin' for you.
Is this the end of death as we know it?
more inevitable than ironic.
You say that, but once you realize what this means for the subways, you're going to miss him.
I guess the only thing we can count on now is taxes.
I always hated that hoodie.
Oh Great! Now we'll never sell those two cemetery plots.
Stay back, I think it's a trap.
Yet another victim of automation.
I knew someday his job would kill him.
I guess now the only constant in life is taxes.
What got him? Taxes?
Well Well Well...look at you...
I told you we should have saved more for our retirement.
He was a great surgeon, but had a warped sense of humor.
Even Death. What's next, taxes ?
He took too much business from big pharma.
And, of course, of the two it had to be Death not Taxes!
All he ever did was take.
Will you got out of that coffin and stop scaring the customers with that get-up; I'm trying to make a sale here.
Bill, call the Moore’s. Tonight we’re gonna party like it’s 1959.
He touched so many lives, but thankfully not mine.
He worked himself to death.
You know what they say . . . what goes around comes around.
He really thought he could cheat death with this outfit?
That’s the trouble with bringing your work home with you
Look who's grim now.
You know what they say about Karma.
The mortician is a genius. He's never looked deader.
They did a good job, he looks so deathlike.
He looks a bit grim don't you think?
He looks so grim
'Guess we should have saved more for retirement.'
Finally, something that’s truly ironic.
Someone finally gave him a taste of his own medicine.
Sure, he won't be knocking at our door, but that just means an eternity of paying taxes.
You never think it is going to happen to you.
I don't know. Is this good or bad?
He seems smaller in real death.
Nothing is certain anymore.
I think I'd like to amend our wedding vows.
Like I always told him, ‘you reap what you sow’.
Now we just have to worry about taxes.
You never think it could happen to you.
I warned him not to mess with Irony...
He was so nice when he came for my grandmother, they had sponge cake.
...next: Taxes.
Irony really is dead.
Even the grim reaper, couldn’t survive the cuts in Medical benefits
He doesn't look that grim.
I guess the only certainty left are taxes
We need to revaluate our retirement plan.
Damn it, if death won't do us apart who will?
I told him to stop touching himself.
I always thought he would bury us all.
Great, we are stuck here forever
I thought 'Dressed to Kill' was a bit vague.
Should be quite a scene at the Pearly Gates!
I guess they're hiring.
"He was 'The' Grim Reaper, not 'A' Grim Reaper. I think we're in the clear.
This does not bode well for over-population.
Isn't that a double negative?
Next, I'll make certain the tax man has a little accident too.
I guess we're only sure about taxes now.
Was it work-related?
We might be here a while.
I would have thought taxes would have gone first.
Now if we could just do something about taxes.
So natural. He looks like he could just sit right up and reap you.
He can't say he didn't see it coming.
I suppose my appointment with him next week is canceled.
He was survived by all of us
Do you think we can cancel the life insurance now?
Or in his case, you reap what you reap.
Until Death do us part...So, now what?
He'll get a break on funeral expenses but what a loss for the industry.
I guess it had to be suicide.
I never thought we'd live to see this day.
You can get up now. They’re not going to ban assault weapons.
If only it had been taxes.
It must have been taxes.
His reputation preceded him.
I told him his job would eventually kill him.
I wouldn't say lifelike, no...
So how do we get rid of taxes?
The coffin company said 'One scythe fits all.'
Irony is dead
Warmed over or not, it's not the look I would have chosen.
This might not be the time, but remember how I told you "til Death do us part"...?
Very sad, always who you least expect.
Very sad. He still had so much to take from the world.
At funerals, I worry I'll be next. This is a relief!
That reminds me - did you file our taxes?
I just always thought it'd be me before him, ya know?
I've always been nervous around people wearing hoodies.
I never thought he would go first.
Well they say "What comes around goes around."
The original misundertsanding came about when they said to him "Its a job for life"
But at least he died doing what he loved to do.
Is this a double negative?
I'm glad I don't have to go to anymore of these.
That seems redundant.
So much for Ars longa, vita brevis.
They say he met a fate worse than death itself.
Death be not proud. Death be dead.
Who is he survived by?
The scythe I can understand, but the Macbook Pro?
Did I just see him wink?
I always said Frank had a morbid sense of humor.
A Trump cabinet job? I warned him.
I guess that means we're getting a divorce
It was suicide. Duh.
Well so much for 'to death do us part'
Should we be bereeved or relieved?
He tried to reap the wrong woman.
I warned you not to screw with the Mishkins.
I guess there's nothing left but taxes!
I always knew he had a death wish.
They say he didn't meet his quota.
It must have been a suicide.
He never returns the tools he borrows
One too many tweets from the White House could kill anyone.
I was sure he’d outlast taxes.
Crap. Does this mean we live forever?
I want a divorce.
Well this does explain the For Sale sign outside of the Funeral Home.
He's dead to me.
The Detectives said it had to be suicide.
You sow what you reap.
He didn't have any family. I hear he was difficult to live with.
This feels like a trap.
You reap what you sow, I guess.
What will do us part now?
You reap what you reap.
You always think, "It happens to someone else."
The blue suit would've been more appropriate, but he always had a flair for the dramatic.
Don’t tell me, he met your mother ...
They think it was an inside job
Is he INSANE, grabbing zzz's in Dracula's coffin ??
Who will cut our grass now?
Why do I not feel reassured?
This is why we need Obamacare.
In this economy, it was the only way he could retire.
Damn, I was looking forward to death-do-us-part
Finally got a taste of his own medicine.
Is this what they mean by "Death takes a holiday?"
He sowed what he reaped.
Looks good. He just came back from Florida.
You've got to admit, death becomes her.
They were saying its a bad flu season.
Harold always did have a weird sense of humor.
It's amazing how Death-like he looks.
He looks exactly the same.
TALK ABOUT IRONY
And they say Americans don't understand irony.
Amazing. After working himself to the bone- genocides, plagues, war, mass shootings- who'd have thought osteoporosis could take him down?
I guess irony is dead.
Well I guess now, "The only thing for certain is taxes"
Poor man certainly looks like death itself.
I'm so tired of irony.
Nothing is certain but taxes.
Well, I guess he reaped what he sewed.
Watch out! I think he’s taking a nap.
I'll miss his jokes and joie de vivre.
Now I'm thinking we might not have saved enough for retirement.
maybe taxes are next...
He always told me his job was a killer.
I heard they made customer experience training mandatory...
Is this what they call irony?
Karma really IS a bitch.
All we have left now are taxes.
Death certainly becomes him.
'Wow - it has been a bad flu season.'
I guess now it's only taxes
I never thought I'd be looking Death in the face.
I told you we didn't have enough retirement savings.
I told him not to mess with the mafia
Truth be told, he was always dead to me.
He got what was coming to him.
Wow, he looks like death warmed over.
I always told him not to run in the house with that scythe.
Doesn't look so proud now, does he !
He should've seen it coming.
If he's really gone, can we forget about taxes too?
He should have taken a holiday now and then...
The NRA made his job redundant...
He looked grimmer in real life.
Don't get too close. It might be a trap.
He looks the same.
I think we're going to need new wedding vows.
He looks so ironic.
Well, I guess that just leaves taxes.
Another suicide, but at least he died doing what he loved.
I always liked him in that suit
He finally lived up to his name.
I see he's taking his scythe with him. Who got the hourglass?
So who came for HIM?
He makes it look so easy.
Now there's only one thing certain.
I knew his work would kill him one day.
I think his job finally took a toll on him.
Truth be told, I'm glad he went first.
So now your mother's going to live with us forever?
Now that just leaves Taxes.
He shouldn't have taken his work home with him.
You free this weekend ? My calendar just opened up.
I told him, what goes around comes around.
What about taxes?
Well, I guess we're stuck with each other...
Ironic.
It had to be a suicide.
No reason not to book that cruise now, I guess.
Toughest whodunit ever.
I told him not to eat the salmon mousse.
Surely self-inflicted.
I still think we should have changed him out of his Halloween costume.
I can't believe it. He was so excited about Trump.
I guess women really do live longer.
He doesn’t look as grim as I thought he would.
Now if only something could be done about the taxes part.
It was only a matter of time before he got a dose of his own medicine.
That's unbereavable!
So who knew he was allergic to hazelnuts?
Don’t get your hopes up Harold, he has a brother.
Such a shame, he had more to die for.
Sugar, the silent killer
I guess we bought ourselves some time.
He always knew how to dress for any occasion.
Your mother said she beat death but this is ridiculous.
He had so much dying left to do.
I guess taxes is all we can count on now.
Apparently he was declared redundant.
He was always a little too good at his job.
He certainly looks right at home.
It's part of his empathy training
Death...here is thy sting.
He never had much luck with relationships.
I always knew he’d dig his own grave
Why do you suppose it took so long before he finally got around to, you know, touching himself.
Well, now I definitely want that divorce.
I know you're not supposed to touch, Brenda, but I've always wanted to know what's under that cloak.
I can't believe he's dead. He just looks like he's reaping.
Hey ... I think we’re in luck.
I guess kharma is a bitch...
In the end, his work was the death of him.
Well, I bet he didn't see that coming. So I guess that just leaves taxes?
We still haven't seen his tax returns.
He lived a full death...
He went doing what he liked best
Really? You think it's fake news?
Karma for the win.
I always thought he would out live us
He was very good at his job but he just worked himself to death.
Never take a hoodie and a scythe to an NRA rally.
He looks like death warmed over.
About time....
That just leaves taxes.
Overworked, most likely...
Does this mean we have to stay old forever?
What was he doing at a tanning salon?
Come to think of it, he'd been looking kind of grim lately.
Yeah, well, he had it coming.
He should have stuck with sowing.
He reaped a lot more than he sowed!
Meta.
I guess we don't have to be vegan anymore.
I guess it was easier than tax reform.
I know people say this all the time, but he really does look just like he’s sleeping…
I guess you reap what you reap!
Doris, don't be so hard on yourself. It was either you or him.
He worked himself to the bone.
You reap what you sow.
The one job he had and he didn't do that right.
How’s our retirement savings?
They made him look so grim.
Yes, but at least he died doing what he loved. (note: any potential credit goes to my 16-year-old son, Asa Kittner. (I blame his father). This is his submission, not mine.
The bastard. We were almost there.
Who did it?
I'll bet he didn't have life insurance.
When it came down to Death or Taxes, you knew how it was going to end….
Apparently, he was taking a selfie.
I will miss your mother.
Who knew? The black hoodie. The long coat. The shiny blade. It could have been anyone at the mall.
What kind of schmuck insists on spending eternity in his Halloween costume?
If only he'd had a gun...
But we didn’t get to tell you about our GREAT-grandchildren.
Sad.... Who will take over the family business now that he is gone and none of his kids are interested?
More than anyone, he should have known that you can't take it with you.
He got too caught up in his work
He wasn't expecting this ... he recently had his blade sharpened.
With health care going the way it is, he said that he really wasn't needed anymore.
He never should have allowed Steve Bannon to touch him.
He died the way he lived.
Serves the bastard right.
Does this mean we can stop paying our life insurance premiums?
His job really got to him, didn't it?
I guess Trump was just too much.
OK, Death's gone. How should we kill Taxes?
I still say he's faking it.
Somehow, I never thought of him as someone with a sense of irony.
good at chess, but Russian roulette wasn't his game
If only we could cheat taxes.
Looks like someone shot the messenger.
You mean I have to live with this arthritis forever?!?
I think this means you can stop paying your life insurance premiums
I think he would have liked this.
How will we tell our kids we’re never going to die?
This is going to kill the funeral home business
I guess that just leaves taxes now.
Take it from me—he's never looked better.
Big deal. There's still taxes.
You're right, he does look warmed over.
I always wondered what happened to Steve Bannon.
Looks like we're off the hook.
It was self-inflicted.
It's all fun and games until someone trips on their scythe . . .
I wonder how this effects our pension?
I blame the N.R.A. He was just overworked.
I hear he didn't escape taxes, either.
Do you think we can get a refund on those plots?
I warned him about bringing his work home with him.
I think the funeral home make up folks did the best they could; especially considering he didn’t have much of a face to begin with.
I guess we’re safe now. Old, but safe!
Nobody's laughing, dear, and Luke needs the scythe back; it's harvest time
Not surprising. He lived by the scythe.
Don't get too close honey, it may be a trap!
He was in a dead end job
I thought our IRA was OK, but this changes everything.
That mortician promised "life-Like" but he looks like death warmed over
I'm telling you he worked himself to death.
If you can't beat 'em...
Now we'll have to completely re-think our retirement plan.
All that money wasted on our life insurance!
I'm not surprised. The last time I saw him, he looked like death.
And my last words to him were that he looked like death itself.
Well, at least we can still be certain about taxes
The new One is coming with a lawn mower...
Who knew about the Grimmer Reaper?
Irony's a bitch.
Halloween just won't be the same.
Things are looking up.
Great...I guess I'm stuck with you.
He's in a better place now.
The death of irony
He looks more Surprised than Grim.
You think the population explosion is bad now, just wait.
Never thought I’d live to see the day!
They did a good job on him.
Looks like he worked himself to death.
I'm guessing there won't be a eulogy.
Weird, he was always after me about smoking.
He looks like death warmed over.
I suppose in the end, he reaped what he sowed.
We always bump into him at these things.
I don't like the undertaker's sense of humor, but he was cheap.
Damnit Alfred, when I said “til death do us part,” I didn’t figure this would happen.
It was either him or me.
I heard he knocked on his own door.
Who do you think came to collect him?
He changed so many lives.
I told him not to mess with me.
Do you think the job killed him?
He kept the lawn so nice.
I guess this leaves us with taxes.
Now you know how it feels
Sad really, he was survived by no one.
They did a great job. So lifelike.
He always was a bit preoccupied with death.
Who's Trump going to replace him with?
How much do we have in savings?
Wait! So the only thing certain now is taxes?
He never missed a day of work. That's probably what killed him.
It's especially sad for cartoonists.
Finally.
Gee. I wonder if he saw that coming?
I thought he was already dead !
The mortician did a beautiful job. He looks positively deathlike!
Couldn't cover his copay.
Don't feel so sad, he brought it on himself.
So now we know.....there's no life after death.
He lived for work.
I guess we're stuck with each other forever, now.
He was so literal.
Death of death... ? is this a joke by Godel, Escher or Bach?
I guess we should have saved more for immortality.
Wow! I guess the end of Obamacare has far more reaching implications than I imagined.
Guess the decision of how to dress the deceased was not difficult.
It’s too bad this didn’t happen when we were younger.
Clear evidence that what goes around, comes around.
I begged him to quit smoking.
We're off the hook until a replacement is named.
Oh No! If one of them had to go, why couldn’t it have been Taxes!
He died of supernatural causes.
He wasn't expecting a mirror.
They say he went through hell.
They say he slipped in the tub.
The doctor said his chances were grim.
The real irony is he worked for the I.R.S.
They say Steve Bannon got him.
I suppose he was dead on arrival.
He winked.
He died doing what he loved most.
Is he in a better place now?
Know what this means, Harold? We'll be miserable together forever.
That was Bernice. Always had to show everybody she was in control.
That's going to be a tough position to fill
The irony of this is inescapable.
He didn't know it was a mirror.
I guess you reap what you reap!
He still looks so deathlike.
He looks pretty grim.
I heard his work finally did him in.
After years of therapy, he finally found himself
So we'll live forever now? I want a divorce.
I guess somebody did not to go gently.
Isn't that redundant.....
He does look like Death warmed over.
I guess you really do reap what you sow...
He was predeceased by numerous souls according to the obit.
I wonder if he saw this coming?
Do we need to still file our taxes?
Does this mean we have to live forever?
Wow! He looks like death. How long have you been waiting to say THAT?
Well Harry, it looks like until death do us part just went out the window.
He died doing exactly the thing he lived for.
He loved irony.
Our retirement fund needs a longer term strategy.
He went before his time.
Looks like we just bought some time.
So I guess it’s no longer til death do us part
Well, that just shows you, there's no such thing as job security!
I never thought it would happen to him.
Looks like we're going to outlive our money.
I think he is faking it.
He's probably not going to a better place.
Any news on who's going to take his place?
They say the workload just killed him.
For him, it's a busman's holiday.
He had to meet his daily quota
Do we still have to file taxes?
BAD BAD KARMA!!!
He works from home now
I told him his job would kill him.
They did a terrible job- he looks like Death warmed over!
Guy never paid any taxes and bragged he was the only certain thing.
We should call Dave at Morgan Stanley on Monday. I assume we'll live forever now.
I guess it's just taxes now.
No more Death...wow. Now I really want a divorce.
Amazing! He looks so dead...
His brother the Happy Reaper is taking his place.
He was always big on DIY
Does this mean we're doomed to live forever?
The homily was interesting; I had no idea he was raised Episcopalian.
Now we can all breathe a scythe of relief.
If I knew it would make us immortal, I would have done this sooner.
He ran Grim Reaper Farm Implements--'one scythe fits all.'
Such a shame. He doesn't look a day over eternity.
I told him not to run with a scythe.
As neighbors go, he kept strange hours but was quiet and kept the rodent population down
Unfortunately, he is survived by Taxes
Does this mean only taxes are now certain?
It seems like everyone is into performance art these days.
He was always so sure of himself, and taxes.
It looks like he finally sowed what he reaped.
I told him he'd work himself to death.
I always thought he would bury us all.
It's a little too self-referential, don't you think?
I feel guilty. We have cheated him a few times..
On the other hand, his lawn was always immaculate.
Better tell the kids to forget about any inheritance.
Thanks, OBAMA.
This is just another one of his ridiculous 'empathy' exercises.
Poor devil...and just when business was booming.
It was a dying profession anyway.
Well, I DID think he was pretty good in that old Bergman movie.
And then after showing him all my pictures, we talked bunions and incontinence. He seemed a little tired.
I guess you reap what you sow.
He looks so . . . unnatural
I heard it was suicide.
Poor Uncle Lou looks like Death.
I guess we can cancel that life insurance policy now.
I expected this would happen after the death of irony.
If this means no more deaths, they'll cut our Social Security.
He becomes himself.
And I was just playing chess with him the other day.
You're wrong Henry. I'm sure that's not my mother.
Terrible workplace accident, I heard.
Well, that will teach him for touching himself.
You know what they say about Karma.
Ed, I must say...they really did a nice job capturing the essence of your mother.
Would this be a murder or a suicide?
He always came to bridge parties with a new partner.
Great. Now who's going to come get us?
I still have his casserole dish from Thanksgiving dinner.
This is really going to stretch our retirement portfolio.
I thought you said his name was Tim Reaper?
Does this mean we'll outlive our 401K?
Do you think we still have to file our taxes?
I never met him.
We can stop taking our meds.
He just doomed us all to life
He looks like hell.
The irony of this kills me
I think I’m going ahead with that skull trephining double lung transplant gender reassignment surgery.
It's sad, but times change. He couldn't compete with Monsanto.
He had been very overworked.
I bet he was a smoker
Heart attack…didn’t realize he was looking in the mirror.
If this is your idea of taking a holiday, it's in very bad taste.
I told you not to buy more life insurance.
If this is your calling, fine. But, you're going to have to move out and get your own place.
Apparently he wasn't grim enough.
Well, this is certainly grim.
They made him look so death-like!
It looks we are going to be married longer than expected
Don’t run with scissors, I said
Seems he reaped what he sowed.
God, now who do we blame?
It always hits the ones you least expect.
Next it'll be taxes.
Well, he reaped what he sowed.
Doesn't he look unnatural?
He told me that learning to juggle would lighten his mood and help with his posture.
I don’t know why, but I always thought that I’d be the one to go first.
So where do you think the White House is looking for his replacement?
So where does that leave taxes?
Quit it, Harold, that's not funny.
I told him not to run with a scythe.
So I guess you really can't take it with you.
I told you not to introduce him to your mother.
Trump replaced him.
Shame; he took himself too soon...
He inspired so many people.
First God Now death. What's next? Taxes?
It's sad, he took his own death.
Hey, that's not Grim! That's Phil Reaper.
Morty always was such a card.
Is this a joke?
This is so meta.
If this doesn't confirm the saying, "We all have to go sometime," then nothing will.
With Trump as President and Weinstein outed, he just lost his zest for life.
I have mixed feelings about this.
Apparently he looked in the mirror and scared himself to himself
I said don't look, I still say it's a trick.
I wish he'd expired when we were in our thirties. Who wants eternity at our age?
Dramatic -- right to the end.
They say he committed scythecide.
I suppose we'll have to start being nice to each other.
Martha, I say we go ahead with that kitchen remodel.
I heard he didn't want to pay his taxes.
He looks right at home.
Death just lost its meaning for him.
Not fair! They wouldn't let Bob take his golf clubs with him.
So he finally took a holiday
Well, I guess what goes around comes around.
"I suppose this makes us the 'Grim Weepers' ".
Black always was his color.
It's all so terribly redundant.
Funny I always thought he would out live us all.
In the final analysis, his career really defined him.
The scythe is a bit of overkill, don't you think?
He's always one step ahead of everyone.
So the reports were not greatly exaggerated.
He sowed what he reaped.
Drat! I was counting on him to do us part.
Well, it's not as grim as I thought it would be...
He truly lived for his work.
Does that mean he's actually alive? Double negative, right?
He was absolutely phenomenal in "The Seventh Seal.
Maybe there really is death after death.
Rest in Peace Mr. Bannon
He's a dead ringer for his father.
Time is no longer of the essence.
We don't have to be afraid to answer the door anymore!
Live by the scythe...
He always did love dressing the part.
FAKE DEATH!
We bought him that outfit for Halloween one year--remember?
‘Great, all those years of paying into life insurance was for nothing.’
We will miss him, thankfully.
The irony is Grim. He reaped what he sowed.
At least, now, he’s probably in a better place. Norway.
He wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
He doesn't look all that grim. They did a nice job with him.
He looks like life warmed over.
It's always about him.
Seems redundant.
Does this mean your mother is living us forever?
What do you think this means for our retirement plan?
Looks like not fixing the railing on the front porch was a good idea.
" So we finally beat death, now what ?
Does this mean I'm married to you for eternity?
I knew his job would kill him
Now who’s gonna visit us?
Makes you wonder what in Hell he's going to do there.
We need to sell the business before someone finds out.
So now who’s got the last laugh?
Well, frankly, we're all relieved.
He had a steady job, he was respected, I don't know why he gave it all up to 'find himself.'
One scythe fits all.
Let's not let celebrity endorsements affect our purchase decision.
What's next. No taxes?
Reap no more!
Of all people.
Funny, He never saw it coming.
It's about damn time.
You now, he actually does look grim....
Still so grim
It kills me to see him like this
But doesn't he look good.
Well, at least taxes are still certain.
He hasn't been warmed over yet!
Well, Grandma DID have a flair for the dramatic...
He always thought it could never happen to him.
He hasn't looked this good in centuries.
"He always had a death wish".
I didn't even know he had retired!
Well, this is the last funeral we'll ever go to.
In your eulogy, don't mention his deadpan sense of humor.
Good work, Smithers. Now see what you can do about taxes.
To their horror, Mildred and Seymour come to realize their relationship has outlived irony.
He died as he lived.
You can't reap forever.
This one in particular has me feeling old.
We really need to widen our circle of friends
Looks like the Reaper didn’t know about Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law......
How many times did I say, "Howard, this cosplay obsession will end badly?"
I don't see the irony.
Why couldn't this happen when I was in my 20's?
Somehow, Putin got to him.
I dare you to kiss him.
I always thought we would go before him.
It couldn't have happened to a better guy.
His expression is grim.
I guess they reached their quota with this administration.
That's what happens when death refuses to take a holiday
Reap no more, my darling.
We got him, but are there others?
It’s called karma.
He’s never looked so good.
At least we can still count on taxes. . .
Looks like that brutal schedule of modeling for all those New Yorker cartoonists finally did him in.
So, how's it feel to be on the receiving end?
I told Harry that was a bad Halloween costume.
If I told him once, I told him a million times, that his job would be the death of him.
What a shame. I was dying to meet him.
We told him it was a dead end job.
It was the salmon mousse.
You might not believe it, but it has seven cup holders.
The flu was really contagious this season
They are going to have a hell of a time closing the casket.
Shhhh, don't wake him up.
He looks so young.
This will give us a little more time.
They say you reap what you reap...
Does this mean we have to stay in The Villages for eternity?
Never bring your work home with you.
Oh my, Ned, they did such a good job. So lifelike!
I always told him his work would be the death of him.
The irony is killing me.
I hope this doesn't mean we live forever.
If you say, "He looks so natural," one more time it's going to be you in that box.
He didn't even own a decent suit?
He never did learn to sow.
Well, that's not going to be good for business!
You know what they say, you reap what you sew!
Who do you suppose the soul executor is?
Well....at least we’ll always have taxes.
The Zero Population Growth folks must be devastated.
Amazing how deathlike they managed to make him.
Guess we'll have to find a new fear to let dictate our lives.
Work was his life.
Now we'll never get relief from our student loans.
We won.
Does this mean we are stuck with your mom forever?
I wonder who called on him?
Does this mean we're off the hook?
All that's left now is taxes.
I hate to say it, but he's never looked better.
I guess my appointment for next week is cancelled.
I kept telling him he was working himself to death.
I guess it's true what goes around comes around.
Well, you can't say he didn't deserve it.
I'd say he reaped what he sowed.
The good news is it looks like we can cash out our Life Insurance Policy.
You should see the other guy...
He had so much to look forward to -- the individual mandate had just been repealed.
They say his outlook on life was rather grim.
Isn't this a little redundant?
No, you're right. It's probably not what he would've wanted…
Poor guy. Lost his job to an AR-15.
Don't fret dear. You still have taxes you can be certain of.
I'm not surprised. He looked like death.
I guess you reap what you sow.
It broke his heart to see technology taking over his job.
Now what ????
Too bad he had to deliver the message to himself.
Cartoonists around the world are mourning the death of a beloved cliché.
I hear he died of supernatural causes
He always loved coming to the funeral home.
The irony of dying on Halloween, dressed like that.
He overdosed on thoughts and prayers.
Where else would he sleep?
I heard he died on the job.
I suppose nothing will part us now, dammit.
Never did find out who he was coming for.
death becomes him don't you think?
How do we know he's not just playing dead.
My god. He looks like death warmed over.
He made his bed, now he is lying in it.
It must have been self defense.
I still can't believe it, he was always so full of life.
Now that's grim!
Yes, I agree. We should give him a good deal on the casket. I would hate to be accused of CHEATING death.
I'm not sure how to feel, to be honest.
This looks like a New York Times Caption Contest
Ya reap what ya sow Harry, ya reap what ya sow.
I'm sure not going to be the one who tries to close this casket.
Is that a scythe in his casket, or is he glad to see us?
Apparently he was overcome by people looking to escape this administration.
'Til death do us part...well, can't count on that one anymore.
When he was starting out, he would kill the weeds on my lawn.
He had to know you reap what you sow.
Well, he certainly reaped what he sewed!
"I warned him not to confuse his sickle with his selfie-stick – but would he listen?|
I think Florida was too much for him
I hope he didn't leave us anything!
Dying won't be the same anymore!
I guess not even Death will do us part now
Back to work—you’re killing our business.
No, you hug him.
He truly lived as he died.
At least he died doing what he loved: Dying.
I guess he reaped what he sowed
I warned him that job would be the death of him.
It was the job that killed him.
"I guess that "times up" movement really got to him
Bet he never saw That coming.
I’d like to remember him how he was as a child, the Happy Reaper.
Have you ever seen anything more redundant?
I guess this means that now I have to put up with you...forever.
And you insisted we go with a term life policy.
I didn't mean to hit him that hard. I thought it was a home invasion.
Don't touch him. It's a trick.
Do we still pay taxes?
He died of irony.
Gives real meaning to " Reap what you sow".
I think we should cancel our Life insurance.
You think that he would have put up more of a struggle.
OSHA'S gonna have a field day with this one.
Poor dear man! He so wanted to outlive Henry Kissinger.
I told him his job was going to be the death of him.
So does that mean we have to go and live forever?
I guess that Death is finally taking a vacation.
There goes my guaranteed escape from a horrible marriage.
This is what happens when you arm everyone with a scythe.
I guess it really does come around.
We'll have to find another way out.
He didn't see this one coming.
You live by scythe, you die by the scythe.
His work finally did him in.
Certainly, it could only have been suicide.
The mortuary did a wonderful job. He looks so death-like.
I told him not to use it, I even bought him an electric shaver.
The Grim Sleeper
We better call our financial planner.
'Turns out, it WAS the salmon mousse."
He looks so supernatural.
I told him not to run while carrying that scythe.
Let's call Bob and tell him not to file our return yet.
It's like staring death in the face.
Somehow I'd pictured cremation.
It only looks like irony is dead.
We’re going to need a bigger IRA
We'd better rethink that reverse mortgage
He died as he lived: Grimly.
I told him he was working too hard, but did he listen? No.
Is it too late to revoke our Irrevocable Charitable Trust?
Did he believe in life after himself?
Ironic, isn't it?
Take that sucker.
To me it's just overkill.
It was a thankless job, but he never complained.
And here is our deluxe model. It comes complete with valet...
Grim, sure, but to us he'll always be just Chad.
I heard his replacement is just killing it!
You know this is gonna play hell with our retirement savings.
Does this mean we'll be together forever?
Heard it was death by cliche.
Well, at least we still have taxes.
Like I was saying, the only real certainty is taxes.
Well Bill, it looks like you're coming out of retirement again.
Done.
Was that custom-made, or is it one scythe fits all?
He finally reaped what he sowed.
Ironically, no one was more surprised than he himself.
That's the last time we let that Goth kid dress the deceased.
You'd think the undertaker could make him look a little more alive.
Sure he falls asleep at work, but he is still our best employee hands down.
He’s not sleeping George, he’s waiting
He was so full of life.
I had just assumed it was Cheney...
And to think, I was afraid of him just yesterday.
I never thought it was possible, but he looks better dead than alive. And that damn smirk is gone!
I guess it's true - you reap what you sow
Shut up John, this is NOT good news, not with our 401(k)!
I guess we've got to cut our own wheat.
He looks just like Max von Sydow.
He looks like himself
They did such a good job. He looks so dead.
I bet this isn’t the last we’ll see of him.
I guess he met his match!
Oh, how the tables have turned!
His replacement is a drone.
Now that's a real scythe of relief.
Doesn't he look just like himself?
His job finally got to him.
It never occurred to me that suicide was even an option.
Oh my. But wasn't it just the best Halloween party?
Why are you so sure that you beat Death? Maybe I'm the one who beat Death.
That job was the death of him.
I always said he had a sick sense of humor.
Not a very good job. He looks like Death.
Kind of redundant isn't it?
Well then, I guess all that leaves us is taxes
Like they say, what goes around comes around!
He's faking.
It was inevitable. I went to Taxes funeral last week.
Well, he sowed what he reaped.
He always was a do it yourselfer!
Faker.
I suppose you think that’s funny, Harold.
Father always had a flair for the dramatic.
Steve Bannon pointed at him.
He had a bad heart. Maybe he should have used the weedwhacker.
What comes around...
Well, I guess you reap what you sow.
I hope it's not contagious.
He still looks grim to me.
You'd think they at least would have put a sport coat on him.
Goes to show you, nobody is irreplaceable.
I told him not to binge watch the Ingmar Bergman marathon.
We're going to need a longer-term retirement plan, Harold.
I know I'm stating the obvious here, but at least he's in his element.
“ And right here we have our Deluxe Model that includes concierge service”.
You always told him to wear reflective gear at night, didn't you, dear?
I told him that the tea was meant for you.
Who in the hell came to collect him?
I told him this job would take its toll on him.
He looks almost lifelike.
Another iconic celebrity whose past finally caught up with them
Guess we should rethink our retirement plan.
He looks so...self-satisfied
Do you think it’ll be okay if I take up smoking again?
Someone's going to kill for his job.
3.	He died from sickle-cell anemia.
I guess "Until Death Do Us Part" no longer applies....
I'm not sure we put enough away for retirement.
I warned him that the NRA would work him to death.
They did such a wonderful job on him - so dead-like.
You never think it’s ever going to happen to you...
Funny, I always thought I'd go first.
The closer you get, the less scary death is.
Well I've seen grimmer.
A clear case of conflict of interest.
I can’t say I’m going to miss him
Would it be wrong to put this on my Instagram feed?
You know, death does become him.
Hmph! He has to make it all about him.
One thing is now certain. We’re not paying our damn taxes.
This might be a good time to look at our retirement spending plan.
I guess there's something to be said about Karma after all Fred.
Doesn’t look so grim any more, does he dear?
I guess taxes are the only certainty in life now.
"Don't you have something better to do, ride a pale horse or something?
Now, this IS the definition of ironic...
That's what happens when you define your life only by your job
He was just tired of death.
I wonder how he found out?
Well, it really looks like what ye sow so shall ye reap.
The Grim Reaper just can't keep up up these days with all the guns out there now. He said it was either him or the NRA had to go.
It must have been all that kale.
So I’m laying there in the ER and I said to him “I am rubber, you are glue”.
Fake news.
I wanted the blue pin-stripe, but his will was very specific.
I always thought he worked for the CIA.
He doesn't look all that grim if you ask me.
This reminds me of something from John Donne.
There goes 50% of everything we were certain of.
But still, don’t you think it’s ironic ?
He was a good son but he did get some bad influences from your side of the family.
So much for Plan A. I want a divorce.
It's the only time I can look at him and feel relieved!
Oh, he looks so deathlike!
He said that he'd rather die than put up with another 2 years and 10 months of this misery.
He looks so much like your mother
He's so unlifelike.
Don’t look so grim— you reap what you sow.
"Not possible," said he. "Watch this," said he, all holier than thou.
You reap what you reap.
At least we can still count on taxes. . .
He looks just like his dad.
Well...what goes around comes around.
I just can not believe it, he was such a good neighbor. He mostly kept to himself but he had a really great lawn.
He was all about his personal brand.
They say his last words were: "I shoulda voted for Hillary."
His last words were "I want to take a selfie".
Apparently it's time to sow.
He looks surprisingly lifelike.
I understand his caption didn't make the final three.
"He always had a death wish".
OK, so how did our wedding vows end again?
He reaped what he reaped.
Don't wake him up.
The coroner said it was suicide.
Well, we still have taxes.
Well I guess it's up to us now to wreak death and destruction.
I want a divorce now that death can't do us apart.
Drama queen.
This is going to be a disaster for the funeral home business.
He took on the Energizer Bunny
That what happens if you wear a hoodie in Florida
I think he looks more glum than grim.
Well, Reap what you sow.
Damnit Edna, does this mean I’m stuck with you for all eternity?
It was grim. He reaped what he sowed.
Oh, he's not dead. He's just trying some role reversal
Turns out he had a twin.
I told you he looks like Death.
No longer the messenger.
The made him up well. He looks less grim than I thought he would look!
...And yet so life like
I'm feeling healthier already.
I heard he killed himself.
I guess sometimes you can take it with you.
He's always napping on the job.
So, I guess he's now the Grim Sleeper.
He always had a dark sense of humor.
Would it be in bad taste to comment on the irony?
I don’t know how many times I warned him, that job was going to kill him.
Great. Now what the hell is going to do us part?
Why does he look so grim?
Harry, what a beautiful job. He looks almost death-like.
I'm pretty sure he's faking.
I guess there's only one thing that's certain.
He'll be back before you know it.
It was just a matter of time.
I told him the pot roast was to die for.
Taxes finally got the better of him.
Shame on you, falling asleep on the job!
He left so many loose ends.
He sure had That coming.
Well, I won't miss his knock at the door!
Considering all the funerals he attended, I just thought there would be a bigger turn out.
They say it was auto-necrotic asphyxiation.
You're right, death does become her.
Harold told me he was working nights, but this is was the last job I would have guessed.
Guess she finally found the killer app.
So he reaped.
So, after years of talking about it, he's finally taking his job seriously.
No. that's George. He wanted to be buried with his favorite hoodie and garden tool.
I had never been able to define "irony."
Well, our retirement plan just went out the window.
He wanted to know how it felt.
I hear his son, Tim Reaper, will be taking over the family business.
I used to warn him, G.R., eventually you really do reap what you sow.
If Taxes are next, we're all set!
He had so much life in him.
His son, the Dim Reaper, is even worse!
I guess he reaped what he sowed
Mother was right. You reap what you sow.
We may need a LOT more for retirement.
Payback's a bitch.
Ironic, isn't it?
With every Tom, Dick and Harry waving around an AR-15, he just couldn't compete.
Well, the old guy finally got his due.
We never were close.
I told him not to bring his work home.
They said his job was a real killer.
"Take the hoodie off," I'd say. "Why? What could happen to ME?" he'd say.
I'm sorry I wasted so many meals on kale.
he loved that scythe
I suspected he never planned to return our scythe.
Karma's a bitch, ain't it?
Sheldon's sense of humor was an acquired taste.
Funny, I never thought of him as grim.
Do you think he gave our name to his replacement?
Who's going to come for us now he's gone?
Death suits him.
Now that's what I call overkill.
Thank god we won't have to see him at the Halloween party in that costume again.
If only taxes could be next…
I hit him with the pan.
I suppose that means we should sell the parlor, right?
Maybe he’s just playing dead.
We’re in big trouble. Looks like it even got too grim for The Reaper!
Now all we have to worry about are taxes.
Now the only thing left to be certain of is taxes.
How much did you say is left in the retirement fund?
Looks like we're stuck with each other for eternity.
If he had a face, this would have wiped that smug smile off it.
...And he had so much to look forward to.
Does this mean we don't need life insurance?
Jeff always had a flair for the dramatic.
They did a great job of making him look dead.
I guess we're down to just taxes now.
An open casket, I thought you said he was Jewish?
Who’s going to take over the family business?
Busman's holiday.
Look at the bright side. This makes us immortal.
Apparently, Death does becomes himself.
It seems like overkill, if you ask me.
Didn’t I say he was looking more grim than usual lately?
Looks like the next international crisis will be overpopulation.
They really captured his personality.
He outlived all his friends.
So much for the “scything is good cardiovascular” theory.
...well.......I suppose that proves it....what goes around DOES come around...
Should we switch back to planning long-term?
His death certificate must make for ironic reading.
I think he’s just playing dead.
Come to think of it, he was looking a bit grim just last week.
If he's really dead , let's get face lifts .
Don’t get your hopes up . . . he’s already been reincarnated as a creepy beast with orange flesh and tiny hands.
Well, you know what they say? You live by the scythe, you die by the scythe!
I didn’t think he’d actually drop dead.
I'm not proud of it, but it was either him or me.
What comes around,goes around.
So...what does that mean for the rest of us?
I still don’t understand irony, Fred.
I knew taxes would catch up to him eventually.
I guess we should call him the "grim sleeper" now.
That's it. We're never getting out of here.
He had a run-in with Father Time.
He looks like life warmed over.
The mortician did a wonderful job. He looks much less imposing as the grim sleeper.
We always thought he'd be the last to go.
Apparently his wife was fed up with snoring.
Does this mean we're gonna be stuck in these bodies forever?!
Don’t ever mess with us again. Got it?
He died like he lived.
Not looking so 'warmed over' anymore, are ya, pal . . . ?
I told him not to look in the mirror.
Too bad he still has an ax to grind. Won't make it through the pearly gate metal detector.
Marge, I guess you won the dead pool.
Looks like the Trump's presidency is even too grim for the Reaper!
I guess that self-defense class paid off.
They did a great job. He looks just like he always has.
He looks good warmed over, actually.
Well, it's about time!
Grim, very grim
We must be dead.
Well, like they say, nothing lasts forever,
I happens even to the worst of us.
His life was cut short but personally I think he's got no one to blame but himself.
Doesn't it seem redundant?
Grim, yes, but a good provider.
Well. I guess that means we’re stuck here.
Don’t feel guilty. It was him or us.
Now only our taxes remain certain.
It was either me or him.
I knew we shouldn't have asked your brother to pick the burial outfit.
Then it's true, you reap what you sow. Sad.
Is irony officially dead?
At least we are facing death together.
OK Harvey. Now you may drive.
I always told him that job would be the death of him.
I always said that job would be the death of him.
I begged him to get into farming...
This is grim.
He finally caught up with himself...
There'd be more people here if he'd never visited them.
I was wondering where he slept
I have to say, I'm surprised I survived him.
They did an amazing job. He looks so life like.
He always said "What goes around comes around"
I guess this proves it: As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
He should've quit while he was ahead.
They did a terrible job on him, he looks like death warmed over.
Told you I was a good chess player.
He loved that scythe more than life itself.
Harold, this is so meta.
He's the only guy I know who on his deathbed said he wished he'd worked more.
I wonder who told him.
Do you suppose this is our last wake, George?
Karmic, don't ya think?
It was a weed whacking accident.
The Grim Sleeper
At least he didn’t suffer.
I heard Bob from Accounting is set to replace him.
Killer Presentation
He was always so full of life
So what does this mean for taxes?
I knew this job would be the death of him.
Talk about a fall from grace.
Did he resign?
He looks so dead.
And apparently he didn't escape the IRS either...
He looks like death and is dressed to kill.
I always thought that scythe would be the death of him.
I think he looks rather grim?
Finally, a taste of his own medicine.
I guess we can throw away those Living Wills, Arthur.
'He looked like death anyway.""
I didn't know he was even ill.
I suppose we have to rethink our retirement savings...
I bet he never saw it coming.
He must not have brought in enough business.
I'm guessing the eulogy will be short.
They captured his quirky sense of humor perfectly.
I guess the end was nearer than he thought.
Marty, we're not paying our taxes this year.
Don't get too close Helen." "This may be a trap.
He says to me "Shirley, I have come..." then just collapses.
...he never smiled like that....
Take that you rat bastard.
He who lives by the scythe dies by the scythe.
Who knew
He thought everyone was cheating on him.
He finally met his match!
I don’t know about you but this is the first time since I turned 70 that a don’t feel that sense of dreed.
Goes around comes around
Rumor has it he went down swinging...
Poor thing... he just couldn't compete with the NRA anymore.
I guess we don't need that life insurance policy now.
Did he name a successor?
I understand it was a rapidly developed case of irony.
I didn't see that one coming...
It's official, everyone we know is dead.
Do you think he saw it coming?
DonT move andy closer, he may have one last whack.
I thought he'd live forever.
It was a self-inflicted wound.
OK, now it's his turn, let's wait three days and see what happens.
I guess we can cancel our life insurance policy now.
I hear that he left no survivors.
He always took his work so personally.
They're saying it must have been suicide.
Well, so much for 'Until Death Us Do Part'
Are we looking at eternity with each other?
He died as he lived: dead.
There goes our exit strategy!
She had the perfect outfit for every occasion.
I told him this would happen if he touched himself.
Somehow I just never imagined he'd go before us.
Cut down in his prime.
We're seeing the end of the funeral industry right here.
At last, a smile.....
I always warned him: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’.
We told him it was a dead end job.
That's going to be a lot of funeral home directors out of business.
I hear he was on holiday when it happened.
Well that's another thing we don't have to worry about.
They always said he looked like death warmed over.
They traced the poison to Putin.
Karma can be a real bitch!
Why are we the only ones here, Bonnie?
Too bad. He worked himself to death.
This undertaker has a reputation for being too literal in his fashion choices.
Death seems to suit him.
At least he passed doing something he loved.
He always said he would be better off dead.
This means eternal taxes.
They say it was a self-inflicted wound.
Well Bill, what goes around comes around." "Yeah Mary, and makes you wonder...... who tapped him on the shoulder?
Don’t get too close. Being dead doesn’t stop this guy.
It really does happen to everyone.
Talk about your "Death warmed over."
Hoisted by his own petard.
Do you think this is the last thing people usually see?
I told him he shouldn't take his work home with him.
That's my Jerry; ironic to the very end."
I'm just not certain about anything anymore.
Guess it was work that finally did him in.
Bob always did have a flair for the macabre.
So peaceful... he looks like he's reaping...
They said it was an unusual outbreak of 'sickle cell'.
They always say, live by the scythe, die by the scythe.
I thought there’d be a bigger turnout.
What do ya know, karma does exist.
I told you we'd regret opting for early retirement.
Did you just see him wink at me?
Ironic.
I saw him three months ago in Miami. He looked warmed over.
I told him it was a bad sign when he was asked to train his replacement.
You have to give him credit. He reaped what he sowed.
That's a relief. Now there's just the matter of taxes.
So, I guess this means we're in for the long haul.
I thought it was “til death do us part” not “til death does depart.” Does this mean we’re divorced?
I told you the chicken was bad.
You never fully appreciate someone until they're gone.
Well, I think it's fake news!
I was sure he’d outlast taxes.
Even death must take a holiday.
He picked the wrong one to come after.
So Death, now you know where your sting is!
I always thought we'd go before him.
I guess we can cancel our appointment.
Talk about overkill.
No, one scythe does not fit all.
Oh no! This means we will never part!
Great Martha, now I have to deal with you forever"
Apparently that's what 4 billion years without a day off will get you.
Now we can finally rest in peace.
And I thought life was ironic!
Ya know this could be his big break.
He said that he couldn't take another minute of the Trump administration.
If this means the rest of us are immortal now, I’d like to take back something that I said during our wedding vows.
No, he does not look proud.
I did warn him Rupert Murdoch wouldn't play nice
Black was never your mother's color.
We're still not safe. He just created a job opening.
He went out with a scythe.
He said he couldn't take it any more--seen too much death.
Who gave THAT order?
I told him my "No soliciting" sign meant business.
It's sad, but a touch ironic, isn't it?
He was really showing his age.
I don't know what possessed him to look in the mirror.
These Snicker’s commercials are really pushing the envelope.
‘Now that’s what I call a dead end...”
It was early retirement that killed him.
Cousin Ralph? Who knew?
Well, I guess there's no point in renewing our life insurance.
My goodness, he’s all skin and bone.
I heard it was sickle knell aenemia.
That's OK. We really don't mind waiting.
And don't forget, he was first in his class at Wharton.
I knew his job would kill him
Is this ever going to play hell with Medicare funding.
Ironically, he's never looked more lifelike.
He won't be missed.
I'm thinking, that might be as Grim as he gets.
As you reap, so shall you go.
I'm still confused. Who came to claim him?
It happened very suddenly. But just before she died she let out a long scythe
And I was really counting on ‘till death do us part.’
Still with the hood...
Friendly fire.
We need to rethink that reverse mortgage.
I’ve outlived him, and I’ll outlive you!
He always said he wanted to see how the other half dies.
The world may know him as grim but he will always be our little snuffy.
I warned him that his job would be the death of him some day.
He dug his own grave.
I'm sorry, but I just can't pretend I'll miss him.
He still looks so grim.
I tell you, that Baltimore is one tough town.
Maybe we should consider long term care insurance.
You wake him.
He finally looks comfortable in his own skin.
Holy crap! Does this mean we have to keep living?
He's not dead. That's how he relaxes.
It's grim.
Who's going to come and get him?
Touché!
No, Mildred, I do not think he looks a little like Morgan Freeman.
They say he was grim right to the end.
He sacrificed his life to the job and they couldn't bury the man in a decent suit?
Now that we're immortal, where do you want to go for lunch?
Oh Henry, how he loved that scythe. He took it everywhere with him.
See what happens when you stop working?
I wonder if he also paid taxes?
He had so much more to reap!
Things are looking pretty good for the rest of us
I always warned him that you reap what you sow.
I guess we can go back to cooking with schmaltz.
That's some slacking off there.
Must have been suicide
I know it's just a display, but I still think it's wrong.
Now we know why he missed book club.
Not so grim now, are you?
It's a shame, really. He was going straight towards that detestable Mrs Finkelstein but he tripped and now this!
I’m gonna kill the guy who did this.
Can you believe that that was my 5th grade crush?
How did they make him so death-like?
He was a mystery, and now he’s inside an enigma, wrapped in a hoodie.
I told the folks at The New Yorker that they were overdoing the grim reaper thing, but would anyone listen to me?!
He died of irony.
What a shame. I heard he wanted to be cremated.
I understand that he failed to pay his NRA dues.
Ok, now taxes.
And he thought he was invincible
I guess you reap what you sow - or is it the other way around?
And just two nights ago he seemed so well when he took Aunt Doris.
So young...so much potential
I'll say it: good riddance.
What's next...taxes?
I told him not to mess with Chuck Norris.
Worked himself to death. Sad.
We'll always remember this day...April 1st!
This is where he takes his naps.
Damn, who's going to come for you now?
Well, Harold, it looks as though we'll be hanging around for awhile after all.
I told him not to take a holiday.
Well, at least they made him look a little less grim.
Boy are we are getting old
He seemed like a nice enough visitor, but maybe we talked too much
He was less certain about about the deductability of his scythes as an unreimbursed business expense.
If only he had retired earlier.
So, how'd he die?
Now you can only count on taxes!
He finally caught up with himself...
Suicide? No, it's just his favorite place to take a nap.
One would expect him to know not to text while reaping.
I guess there is an expiration date for everything...
I wouldn't have expected "I'm rubber, you're glue" to work with him.
Doesn't he look lifelike?
I guess we're stuck with each other for eternity now.
You know, he was the last one I ever thought would go.
Even after death, his outfits are still a scythe for sore eyes.
What makes you think it was suicide?
John Donne said this would happen.
Looks like he blew a casket.
At least he's in a deader place.
Does this mean we won't get our chance to get out of this godforsaken world?
Boy, the new administration can do anything, first taxes, now this!
"The poor soul, he worked himself to death".
I heard Kushner is applying for the job now that he lost his security clearance.
They say he clicked on SEND by mistake.
Careful. He might be faking it.
We just worked him to death, poor fellow.
Suicide?
He spent his life preparing for this moment.
You should of seen the other guy.
Well, it's just tragic he went before your mother.
Till death do us part my ass.
Does this mean we can summer in Syria, if we want to?
It's the irony of Death.
It's what he always wanted; he looks so life-like!
And we always wanted him to be a doctor.
Live by the scythe...you know the rest.
Say what you will, he's leaving the world a better place.
he was a tireless worker.....gotta' give him that....but I don't think he'll be missed...
I'm thinking of hang gliding. How about you?
He's in a similar place now.
Finally.
I guess we won't be needing those plots anymore.
Oh dear! He certainly looks like Steve Bannon.
Really? For me it just raises more questions.
I always told him, "Doug, don't run with a scythe."
Got a pin?
It just goes to show...you reap what you sow.
Oh dear,now we have nothing to look forward to.
Does this mean I'll never get rid of you !!!
It was him or us, dear.
They made him look so lifelike.
I feel bad --- but it was either him or me.
Well, somewhere on the Styx Charon is going broke.
There’s no one who could take his place.
And I heard that Taxes is doing just fine.
Seems like overkill.
I love a sales person who demonstrates the product.
He would have appreciated the irony.
Doris was always so overly dramatic.
Now that he's gone, do we still have to pay taxes?
Take the scythe, then we can have closure.
The long hours. Endless travel. I think his job killed him in the end.
Just think, he died on our doorstep.
He almost looks dead.
...How were we related again?
He came knocking and I answered the door in my birthday suit.
‘Reaping ‘ what he sowed
I suppose I should feel guilty, but it was either him or me.
Now that’s a busman’s holiday.
He died of uncontrollable grief believing that death and taxes were inevitable until he ran into the Republican upper class and their new tax reform bill
I had helped him pick out a nice blue pinstripe, but when was the last time he listened to his mother"
So much for my dream of widowhood.
I can't say I'll miss him.
He couldn't find Trump's soul and it destroyed him.
He still looks so full of life!
Mort, I never liked him anyway
Our HR department is going to be lost without him.
He looks so dead it’s hard to believe he’s gone.
Well ... it’s not like I was going to stop for him!
Uhoh, I don't think our insurance will cover us living for ever.
I guess we should start planning for our 100th anniversary.
It was his time, again.
It's so ironic.
But is it good for the Jews?
Looks like we beat the odds.
Well, I say he was proud, and I say the hell with him.
I told him that job would be the death of him.
He's the last of a dying breed.
I can tell you one thing. I'm unloading my funeral home stocks.
He had ONE job!
I’m feeling pretty overcome with sadness—but more so, irony.
And our pre-need package includes everything your soon-to-be-deceased loved one needs.
He really felt suicide was his only way out.
I'll miss his irony.
Speaking of certain, I'd hold off on paying our taxes.
Honey, did we miss the end of time?
Maybe he’ll be reincarnated as a comedian.
I guess it’s hard to make a living as a performance artist.
But then his outlook brightened, so we knew it was only a matter of time.
I guess this means we’ll never die. I want a divorce.
Does this nullify our vow, "'Til death do us part?"
Larry we're just planning ahead, stop being so dramatic
Death is survived by Hope, Idiocy and Taxes.
Part of his new empathy program.
Bad flu season.
Told him not to take a selfie.
I prefer the one about one hand clapping
He always preferred "lugubrious" to "grim."
That can't be Herman. He hated gardening.
Hopefully this is the last Death in the family.
Now we definitely have to revise that 'till death do us part' clause.
Steve Bannon, we hardly knew ye.
It used to be that nothing was sure but death and taxes. Now President Trump has fixed both!
Ugh. Guess we're in it for the long haul.
As he kept saying, "We all have to go sometime."
I kept telling him, "Herbie, you reap what you sow." But would he listen to me? N-o-o-o!
Now we can start working on taxes.
It was so unexpected.
Do not say he didn't deserve this.
Does this mean we have to go back to work?
'He doesn't look so grim.'
The mortician did a fine job, but the blacksmith really outdid him.
Don't get too close.
Outside of work, he wasn't grim at all.
He had no work-life balance.
The funeral home industry is going to take a big hit.
That was no way to live anyway.
He lived for his work.
I know you didn't like your ex-wife but dressing her like that was overkill.
Do we still pay taxes?
She was never one for subtlety, was she?
Oh Ethel, I think your three months at the hospital really wore him out
It was me or him.
I guess he didn't want to wait for Trump to kill us with the end of the world
I don't know. The death of death means I'll never get rid of these bunions.
No need to feel guilty. It was him or you.
I hear he took his own life.
Gosh, you really do reap what you sow.
No Kevin, this isn't ironic.
Self Referential for sure
Meta.
I'll never forget his last words: "Here, hold my scythe."
Didn’t he have any other outfits?
Does this mean we're stuck here?
I'm a terrible sister for saying it, but Helen always had to be the best at everything.
He's in a better place.
He just never fit in!
Looks warmed over.
Well he said in his line of work retirement was not possible.
Does this mean we're immortal?
There may be some lingering resentment.
That reminds me, did you file for an extension yet?
Your brother the exterminator, a joker to the end.
He was always so full of life
He finally soweth'd one time too many.
Oh well, there goes population control...
He looks happier than I have ever seen him!!
Oh, Lord. Does this mean we have to live forever now?
All the undertakers are fretting about their job security.
He wrote in his Advanced Directive that he wanted to be buried with it.
I thought you said your uncle's name was Roper.
The next time he comes for me he better be carrying more than a scythe.
He was a workaholic.
He should have see it coming.
He always had a strong death wish.
but Mildred,...the reverend said, "till death do us part".
So I guess this means we are stuck with each other forever now!
I guess it's true what they say--you really do reap what you sow.
Well, it looks like you won't be getting that inheritance from your rich uncle after all.
Hmm...I think I'll take up skydiving.
He's just keeping it cold for the next guy
No thoughts and prayers this time.
I told him to get a flu shot!
He's so unlifelike.
This is a problem for Stephen Hawking.
I guess we can finally get a divorce
You really need to get that flu shot.
I guess this means we can buy green bananas again
Reap what you sow, eh?
Well, yes, I suppose it does seem obvious; I'm just saying I was kind of surprised when Millie told me he took his own life.
I talked to him just last week.
It's so sad. I heard he was on his way to the White House with an order of Big Macs.
I did tell Bobby not to go dressed like that to the Retirement Home, Ohh, he didn't have a chance.
This can't be good for business?!
Our life insurance policy rates just went down.
He looks pretty grim.
Taxes is inconsolable.
No worries now, adding Bhutan and Bora Bora to our bucket list.
I guess this is because I could not stop for him.
Heckuva chess player, though...
I told you that life insurance policy was a waste.
Millennials really have killed everything now, haven't they?
Boy, that self-defense course really paid off.
I am told that yes, he paid taxes too.
He was our best agent.
He looks so natural...so deathlike.
All these years he was wearing high heels and a negligee under the robe.
Apparently he reaped what he sowed.
You should apply for the opening. It's a good retirement job.
Carol's sister saw him just last week.
What the fuck?
I bet he never saw it coming.
Someone should have talked to him about that Hoodie
It was suicide.
I heard that scythe manufacturers are delighted since Congress is now planning to arm everybody with scythes---The only way to protect yourself from a bad guy with a scythe is to be a good guy with a scythe.
So much for "til death do us part", looks like we're stuck with each other forever.
Unbelievable...the tie I bought him for Christmas is completely covered.
Even death decided to take a permanent holiday.
Well Howard, maybe we should put immortality back on the bucket list.
That was always his favorite scythe.
I heard he was after Trump.
Jerry was always one for black humor, but really, look at that smile!
He looks good.
The smile isn't right.
I feel like I just stepped into a New Yorker cartoon.
It's not so surprising, all he ever did was think about death.
Well, here's another sad, unheeded lesson about running with sharp objects.
Doesn't look so grim anymore
The funeral director just hired a new dresser who is a frustrated costume designer.
Oh, Death, at last. Here is thy sting!
You were right. I shouldn’t have let him borrow the scythe.
Well I guess he had it coming.
Who says you can't take it with you!
What are we going to tell the kids?
Do you think this lets us off the hook?
They're trying to blame it on immigrants, but I think it was mechanization that really did him in.
I heard he used to work for the Russians
We did our best but he still looks a litle grim.
Finally he has been impeached.
It was a case of character assassination.
His therapist said this would help him relate to his clients better.
He was the first and the last of his kind.
He always loved cosplay.
Oh, woe is me. The irony.
The undertaker did a great job, he looks so death-like
Does this mean I can start smoking again?
Payback's a bitch.
Does this mean I'm going to live forever?
Some say Bannon will rise again
Will our retirement fund last through immortality?
He knew it was coming
Ashes to ashes, scythe to rust
"The irony would have been lost on him".
I didn't think I'd live to see the death of Irony.
Well, I guess reelection is out of the question.
Looks like divorce is our only hope now.
Maybe he's taking a permanent holiday this time.
All I know is that I'm not paying my taxes this year.
They did such a good job with the cheekbones - look at that hollowing.
Working in the White House is a death-defying act for anyone these days.
Every time the doctor would say, "We can cure that", or "we can replace that", it just wore him down and put him into a deeper funk. In the end, he had nothing to live for.
He said he wanted to spend more time with his family.
I guess Death is the new death.
As ye reap, so shall ye get reaped.
Well, I guess we can keep renewing our magazine subscriptions.
I heard that the president is looking for a replacement already.
Too bad they don't make one scythe fits all.
The director called to say you got the part
Now only taxes remain.
His job was automated
It's only March. What will the rest of the year bring?
That’ll teach you! NOBODY messes around with our Howard!
Have you heard anything about a succession plan?
Is there room in there for taxes?
I suppose taxes are next.
Darn, does this mean we’ll live forever?
Fake news. The report of death's death was an exaggeration.
I hear this happens a lot in his line of work.
He always said it would never happen to him.
He said the job was killing himself.
He reaped the most out of life, didn't he?
So now, who comes for us?
No, he does not look so lifelike.
You should see his pallbearers.
So how does this exactly affect our life insurance policies?
He lived a grim life.
Well, that's it. We can live forever!
He was just dying to get in there.
He must have been tough to embalm
I wondeer if the IRS knows yet.
He wasn’t exactly the life of the party.
He doesn’t look as grim as he used to.
Such a wonderful job restoring his natural pallor.
Living forever is definitely going to wreak havoc on our financial planning.
I guess business will slow down for a while.
The coroner's report said suicide.
Overdressed, as usual...
They did a terrible job- he looks like Death warmed over!
Well, I guess it was inevitable.....
Well, at least he is being buried with his scythe; his kids would have fought over who got that damn thing forever.
Does this mean we're stuck together...forever?
THEY SAY HE WAS RUN OVER BY A HEARSE!
I wonder if his heirs will reap what he sowed.
Well, he certainly reaped what he sewed!
That’s why you shouldn’t take your work home with you, Dan.
I don't think he saw it coming.
If he’d been packing, he’d be alive today.
Yea, so about that whole ‘til death do us part’ thing...
I know it's a lot worse this year, Doris, but I'm not sure a flu shot would have helped.
OMG! I cancelled long-term care last week
Well, Carl, I guess that extended warranty on the Chevy was a good idea after all.
Does this mean we don't have to pay taxes?
And you just had to go and spend a fortune on life insurance!
I don’t know, Herbert. Somewhere between relief and wondering who his heirs are...”
"Till death do us part” does not sound promising anymore.
He died doing what he loved. Death.
Gerald never quite understood irony.
The only thing left for us to look forward to was that 'death do us part' bit.
Well I guess this leaves taxes as the only sure thing in life.
He always said the job was killing him.
I guess Blue Oyster Cult was right.
Cheer me up--tell me they've got taxes lying in a casket next door.
Now, that’s taking your work to the grave with you.
He was a good man, compassionate, always used Novocaine.
It was his time, again.
In high school you just can't really tell about people. He was voted "Class clown."
I wonder if he knew he was coming for him?
Was it sudden?
He was so confident his job was immune to outsourcing. Now the NRA has it.
The AR-15 ban is what killed him.
He was always the life of the party
I can’t say that I’m surprised.
What goes around . . .
Why so grim?
Such a sweetheart!! He always tries them on first.
"Till Death do us part" suddenly feels like an eternity.
I didn't realize he was Irish!
I'd heard that his prognosis was grim...
Wow, I guess it catches up with everyone.
I hate to admit it, but there will be times when I'll miss him.
So...if there are no immediate survivors, does that mean I can go ahead and cancel my life insurance policy?
So you reap what you sow. What else is new?
Who said irony is dead?
And yet the Trump Administration continues.
He was to die for back in high school.
What a shame, he was always such a cut up.
In the end, it was the irony that got him.
I guess we should cancel our life insurance now.
They say it was scythe-cell anemia.
He did say, "The end is near."
Oh look, his favorite hoodie!
Did he appoint a successor?
Now what?
They weren't kidding about that flu.
"Amazing, he doesn't look a day over 620".
I didn't even know he was sickle.
You sow what you reap.
I always thought that I would go first.
I can't say I'm sorry to see him go.
He shouldn't have sneaked up on me.
He was doing better until he got sickle.
What fabulous work! He looks so death-like!
Got hit by a John Deere last night. Should have known to make hay while the sun shines.
Work, work, work. He never took a break...just worked himself to death.
It looks like taxes finally caught up with him.
Well, he did say he would even if it killed him!
He said he's the 'Grim Sleeper', the black sheep of the Reaper family.
Poor Reaper. You'd think he could have cheated himself for once.
It's tragic that he took his own death. He had a lot to die for.
I hear he got quite the discount for this funeral.
He'd do anything to avoid calling his mother.
You know that Benjamin Franklin quote about "death and taxes?" I was sure he'd choose taxes.
Now, what'll we do when the annuity runs out?
The life insurance company won't pay because they claim it was suicide.
He didn't look so good at Maxie's funeral.
Guess he couldn't cheat himself.
Do you think we should revisit our financial planning assumptions?
Promise me you'll have me cremated.
It was always “overkill” with him.
Better him than us.
He looks like he’s reaping
We should probably call our financial advisor about this.
Sir, this is NOT funny!
In the nick of time,as far as we’re concerned.
Who's going to come for us now?
That's karma for you.
He killed himself when Trump won the presidency.
You had to serve Tuna Caserole
I'm pretty certain taxes will be next.
I always say, 'What goes around comes around.'
Well, what are we suppose to do now?
He looks so unnatural in there.
Of course he’s faking.
I guess we're stuck with each other forever, Stanley.
When I saw him prowling around the yard last night in the dark, I was so glad to have my AR15 right by the bed.
Poor guy worked himself to death.
Sometimes irony just goes too far
Looks like he took it with him
Does this mean I have to live with you forever?
So full of himself
I guess I can cancel my life insurance policy
Weirdly, I'm going to miss funerals.
I thought he would be taller in person.
I always wondered why he wouldn't talk about his job.
You know what this means, don't you?
I really expected to feel better about this.
He died as he lived... emotionally hollow, inspiring dread in all who knew him, and a pessimist right to the very end.
He died doing what he loved, or vis versa.
What will we do without him?!
I always knew this job would kill him...
The stress of the job is what killed him.
First taxes, and now this.
There’s an Air BnB to suit everybody these days.
I told him that Halloween costume would be ironic.
I used to think I would live forever. Now I'm afraid I just might.
Well, that’s life....
Who knew? John Donne was right after all . . .
Guess this means we're stuck with each other forever
This is life after death and Trump is still in office?
So, where's his sting?
It even got too much for him to take
He looks better than when he was alive.
‘Well, I guess you really do reap what you sow’
Well...I guess he won't be calling us Lord and Lady Dicknose again...
Last time I saw him, he looked like death
I told him not to pick his nose
So it's true .You really do reap what you sow.
Like I always say, "What goes around, comes around!"
so....guess we forget the death do us part thing.
Bringing your work home isn't good for you.
Workaholic.
Timing is everything. He came for me at the gun range!
And to think, he never saw it coming.
Wow, karma really is a bitch.
I wonder who’ll get promoted ?
He made his bed and now he's lying in it.
'Guess we should have saved more for retirement.'
I hope taxes are not far behind
Just when you think that it can’t get any more grim...
These funeral parlor cosmeticians do wonders. He looks just like he did in life.
Imagine, you wreak all that havoc for millennia just to get mowed down by a kia on your way home from the CVS.
Looks like I’m stuck with you, Mort.
I wonder why he never saw it coming.
He doesn't look like he's just sleeping to me.
Well, I always say,"WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND."
He's not so proud now.
Seems he’s always had an ax to grind.
I wish he'd dealt with a couple of your relatives first.
He wasn't much in life, and honestly, he's not much in death, either.
Well, I guess he reaped what he sewed.
If a double negative makes a positive, he should sit up.
We were very close, you know.
Does this mean Trump lives forever?
The death of death. Does this mean that I have to live with you throughout eternity?
He always had a grim sense of humor
Come on, it’s time to get dressed, your father and I are taking you to get a real bed.
Always the kidder.
There goes our ride.
With so many taking over his job, he just gave up.
First to go was the hammer and now this. I guess our dreams of a red state are over.
He would have looked so nice in a suit.
He reaped what he sowed.
As you reap, so shall you go.
He looks so grim
He's just having another existential breakdown, he'll snap out of it by tomorrow.
He requested donations to the Sickle Cell Foundation in lieu of flowers.
I told him he was working himself to death.
He looks so alive.
Looks like he reaped what he sowed
That was always his favorite suit.
I think we should change our will
Looks like United is removing passengers mid-flight now.
Well, dead is dead.
Henry, if this means we are immortal, I want a divorce.
Sure, it's great for us, but what about our Buddhist friends?
Is he really gonna do this every time a White House staffer resigns?
Well, there goes plan 'A' for escaping this marriage.
I guess it's time to bury the hatchet.
Now we stuck here forever....how depressing.
He snuck up behind me before I put my face on...
I wonder who is going to get his job.
Of all the people I thought would outlive us...
I hear he slipped while trying to use it to cut a watermelon.
He never was very good at reaping whatever he sowed, until now.
I have a sinking feeling this will wreck havoc on our long term care insurance rates.
So many questions...
Press secretary, tough job--even with a scythe.
I wonder if he paid taxes too?
Are we really THAT old?
No such luck, I hear he's being replaced by a combine...
This is going to decimate Social Security.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch Bergman so young.
I always thought he was a bit grim.
Yeah but that Taxes fellow is still on the loose.
He came for Uncle Vito, but he didn't understand the rules.
Is that what they mean? Karma's a bitch?
What would have Dante said?
Work overload...another victim of an aging population.
If we're lucky, taxes will be next.
Karma finally got him.
I have to admit, I was never all that fond of him
Now I miss him.
He looks good.
You thought I brought my work home!
They found him unresponsive after losing a chess game to Max Von Sydow.
I told you nobody messes with Chuck Norris
He likes to understand his customers' experience.
Marvin, if you want to go trick or treating we have to leave now.
He must've died of sickle cell.
He took his own life.
Well, he always did say 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.'
Who’s going to take over the family business?
If we live in a post-truth age, why not post-death? What could go wrong?
Ironic, don't you think?
He always said that his job would be the death of him.
I had just come to grips with my mortality.
« I never thought we’d live to see this day »
Did we send Mrs. Reaper a sympathy card?
He wasn't carrying a gun.
You always want what you can't have.
He looks so . . . unnatural
Do you think it's a smart career move or just a desperate stab at irony?
He led such a grim life.
The brother was worse.
It's the end of a trope.
He's probably happier now.
I now have nothing to look forward to.
Wish we'd bought that long-term care insurance...
Workload from the baby boom generation took a toll on him.
Bet he got a quantity discount on the coffin.
Now, who will come for us?
The doctor said he had a few self-destructive tendencies
He looks like death!
So much for being President for life.
I kept telling him you reap what sow, but he wouldn’t listen.
He worked himself to... Hmm, what should we call it now?
This looks like more than a holiday.
Just goes to show you how fragile death is
The coroner ruled it a suicide.
His wake was a ghost town.
Our retirement funds are not going to be sufficient!
Well Martha, it looks like we won't have to worry about him anymore.
I think he's trying to be funny.
I told you we should have put it all in annuities.
Well, THIS oughta blow the Social Security fund once and for all.
What a shame! Just when he got tenure.
I understand the end came quickly when he tripped on his scythe
Okay, now that he’s out of the way,...on to taxes.
He was always so literal!
Well it certainly is unusual, I can only assume it was a fight to the death.
As ye reap, so shall ye reap.
Occupational hazard.
This model comes with a promotional branding display - that can be removed - of course.
It's like he's trying to tell us something.
Who would have told him to get his flu shot?
Do you think he knew?
Wow! Things are worse than I thought.
Trump touched him
Harvey, you should ask if they're looking to re-hire.
You know, death, it's not always about you!
The slide show has his greatest hits
So now I’m stuck with you for eternity?
He could not keep up with technology.
Do you think it becomes him?
I thought Sadie was kidding about Max's secret life.
This is going to kill business.
Uncle Max always had a flair for the dramatic.
Does that mean that we’re stuck here forever?
I would kiss him goodbye but he might still have a bit of kick left in him
He looks so not grim.
This seems like a death trap.
Do you suppose this lets us off the hook for taxes as well?
Till death do us part, huh?
And I thought he'd bury us all...
So fentanyl is safe now, right?
First Trump and now the Grim Reaper drops dead. What's next?
I warned him not to take a selfie with that scythe.
He forgot to pay his taxes.
Couldn't have died in my 20s, could you, Death.
All that's left is taxes.
I hear he fell on his own scythe.
No one can say he didn't fight death right to the end.
The Scythe’s the limit.
He always wanted to know what it was like.
The arrangements are touching, but I'm not sure I would have gone with Blue Oyster Cult.
He'll be hard to replace.
This Administration was too much for him.
I guess the mortician did his best, but he still looks so grim and death-like.
Just last night he said he was tired of the same old grind.
He always complained that his job was too taxing.
Now that's what i called dead.
I knew he was busy, but never imagined he'd overwork himself this way
Wonder who he cut out of his will.
Very meta.
Well, looks like he reaped what he sowed
You see. It's not true. You can take it with you.
Now your relatives will never leave.
Damnit Carl, it looks like Death won't do us part after all.
He was always so proud of his bit part in "The Seventh Seal."
I told you no sleeping in our merchandize! Get to work to bring new customers!
You think this means we can get our cemetery plot deposit back?
Howard, does this mean we will live forever?
He always was sickely
Well, at least there's still the IRS.
Awe hell.
If this means we live forever, I wish we'd saved more money.
See honey, I told you those self defense classes would come in handy.
If we're lucky, a handsome prince won't come along.
Why do I get the feeling this is one big April Fool's Day gag?
'I hear the White House revoked his H1-B visa.'
Death will not be mocked, that's for sure.
Even the grim reaper is no match for father time.
He has no one to blame but himself.
I wonder what this means for our taxes?
now what are we supposed to do?
So lifelike. I feel like he is going to reach out and touch me.
Self inficted wounds.
It's too bad the mortician is out of a job now, he did beautiful work.
He was doing what he loved.
See? Even death would rather die than listen to you nag.
He looks so death-like.
Get up! Break time is over and you are behind on your quota.
Yes, it is Arthur. Art is imitating Death.
He was so full of death.
And Jesus said, 'All who draw the scythe will die by the scythe.'
Well, he cerrainly reaped what he reaped.
"What a putz! He took himself.
Does this somehow null our Marriage?
At least with Trump you may be able to escape taxes.
It's so sad. He had his whole death ahead of him.
I always told him, "Live by the scythe, die by the scythe."
Not sure where this leaves us.
I don't like to speak I'll of the dead, but he got what he deserved.
So now can we stop using condoms?
He never could get out of his own way.
I guess we cancel Grampa's obit
You know, he WAS looking kinda thin lately...
He looks good, considering.
I wish I had got to know him better
Is that lid going to shut?
Well, someone is in for a nasty surprise.
I pray the lord your soul to reap.
Well, I guess they'll be hiring. Call Cousin Mildred's son.
I guess we won’t be leaving any time soon.
He was a great weed whacker. Not so great dealing with the pesticide.
I told him that costume was a bad idea.
Well, I guess all that reaping finally led to some sowing.
Just when I've lost the will to live . . .
Life won't be so grim anymore.
I wonder what he sowed
Well, our business is doomed
Usually the pillow goes under the head, not over the face
Does this mean we are going to live forever now?
His mother would have been so disappointed.
I swear to God, I saw him walking up my driveway, and he grabbed his chest and just fell over.
So much for the mortuary business.
He's still not fooling anybody.
He really should have just left Chuck Norris alone.
On second thought, let's take the one that doesn't include its own Death.
Does this mean we have to stay married forever?
Wow, they do happen in threes. First it was irony, then parody. I hope we're still here in 2020.
I knew the time was close when he stopped sharpening his blade.
That’s really meta
I TOLD him to leave Chuck Norris alone!
Let that be a lesson.
About time....
He looks so natural, doesn't he?
What
Does this mean we can finally cancel that damn life insurance policy?
I heard he did it to avoid taxes.
Well, it finally caught up with him.
Now that's that. We'll have to stay together forever, Marge.
Well, Hank, I guess you're mother really is going to be living with us forever.
He died as he lived: cosplaying.
What a mortician. So deathlike!
I used to look for him after every morning briefing since November 2016.
He just worked himself to death!
No Ralph. You still have to take your blood pressure medicine.
Too bad he never achieved work/life balance
Trump scared him to death?
I dunno. Doesn't look that Grimm to me.
He must be somewhere between the wheat and the chaff.
GRIM, FOR SURE
The ultimate scythe of relief.
They really captured his grim.
Is this supposed to be an endorsement?
I trust Trump will now order NASA to speed up the colonization of Mars project.
A little tasteless maybe, but our Francis always did love irony.
These millennials really are killing everything.
I’m pretty sure he’s just napping.
Well, I'm not surprised. He was always so grim.
Although he was not an employee here, but the Boss figured as a matter of professional courtesy he should get the 20 % employee discount.
Wherever he went he made quite a killing.
Never thought I would live to see this!
Does this mean we're good for a while?
Well, I guess this is the end of Morrison & Morrison Mortuary, dear.
Like I always say,“What goes around comes around, comes around.”
Does this mean we'll be married forever?
Some Holiday.
He looked overworked lately.....
Mrs.Scythe can now reap his death benefits.
Do you think he paid his taxes?
Stan, did he just wink at you??
He never knew it would catch up to him.
He does deserve a holiday.
He insisted on being buried with it.
He always did look so good in black.
Are you going to stop looking over your shoulder now?
I don't get it. He's not dead yet.
Have we paid our taxes?
The bad news is ... we still have taxes to contend with!
For once I’m not lying to say they did a nice job to make Death look so natural.
Guess he played "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" one too many times.
We better call our retirement fund manager, quick! We didn't plan on living for an eternity.
He never could correct that slice.
I told him not to take that bet.
You're right. Looks warmed over to me too.
I wonder what he sowed
Oh Lord. The life insurance companies not going to like this.
Damn it! I wish he died when we were younger.
No doubt about it. Things are about to get really really bad.
He'll be back next week, he's just taking a busman's holiday.
Cigarettes, Whiskey, and Wild, Wild Women, Is what I think
Open casket? Yeesh, he looks like death.
I wonder what this means for the rest of us.
This is why I don't like funerals. They're always too grim.
We shouldn't have put all our eggs in the "'Till death so us part" basket.
He tried to stop #MeToo.
The invitation said this was his retirement party.
Now we're stuck together for eternity.
Wait a second, then where's Herbert?
I sure hope this doesn't mean we're going to live forever
In guess in the end, he reaped what he sowed.
What a shame that no one will get the John Donne reference.
I never did like him.
Lying down on the job!
Death takes a holiday. Again.
Well, he looks less grim
Jerry always had a wicked sense of humor.
Ethel, looks like we dodged a bullet.
They have him looking better than he has in years.
Suicide, evidently. It seems he was very depressed about his job.
Well, he looks like himself
OK, sometimes scythe matters.
Despite his years Grandpa could never stopTrick or Treating
Well, that’s redundant.
He knew what hit him.
The makeup doesn't help.
It's just fake news
He looks so natural ...; or, He looks so unlifelike ...
A wing, a prayer . . . what am I missing?
Are you sure he's dead?
Oh God—does this mean we're going to live for ever?
Do they charge extra for the scythe?
You should see the other guy...
This means that Uncle Mark is going to be at every Christmas dinner for a very long time.
Evidently, he started following the news--and realized he'd been trumped.
He loved that outfit.
And don't ever let me catch you snooping around my azaleas again!
And here I've been reading Donne as figurative this whole time.
well, I guess it's President Pence now
Sickle cell?
I told him if he takes his work home, it'll kill him.
He can't take it with him.
This comes as no surprise. He never would take a vacation.
That’ so grim!
What a pity that he looks so terribly life-like!
He was always such a miserable son of a bitch.
He died so none of us ever will.
He always dreamed of working from home.
He finally had enough of that itch on his nose.
How're they gonna close the casket, Rob? His fucking scythe is sticking right out, it's gonna block the lid. Bill. Bill, it's gonna block the fucking lid.
Does this mean I'm stuck with you for eternity? Death, it seems, is in no position to part us.
What comes around really does go around.
Look at that—lying down on the job.
I know they said she looked like death, but I didn't think it was this bad.
Weirdly, I’m not dying to know what happened here.
He's been down since the scythe became obsolete.
I don't know whether to laugh or sythe.:
It's part of his continuing education.
We're gonna need a bigger IRA.
There goes our funeral plan.
Just my luck. Immortality beckons and my siatica is playing up.
What's next? First it's the death of God. And now it's Death himself.
Rocky said he could sucker punch anyone. Now I believe it.
I heard it was tetanus.
For some reason, he no longer seems so grim anymore.
So much for "'Til death do us part"
He was forced into early retirement.
Pfff… Lazy embalmer!
He never saw it coming.
No one could barter better than David.
He's not as grim as I had imagined.
Manny, get the undertaker! He looks like death warmed over.
Yes, but to me he was just one of the boys in the hood.
He really doesn’t discriminate.
It does not look like him at all!
I just saw him last week, and he looked so dead.
I warned him about touching himself
Sylvia, we beat it!
I suppose we’ll need a riding mower?
So lifelike.
When management catches you sleeping on the job
Well, I guess he's not proud now.
and he was just beginning to hit his stride
‘To think, he used to look so full of life!”
My guess is that he killed himself.
If anyone can take it with him, he can....
There are rumors it was a suicide.....
He died like he lived—dead.
Why do they even have a Super Scythe Me option?
I wonder if he knows we’re still alive!
Death in his natural state
It becomes him.
Talk about a grim sleeper.
I told him he didn't look well.
Any angel of death that represents himself has a fool for a client.
Looks like Grim reaped what he sowed.
You'd think with all that walking he'd live another 20 years.
I say grim and bury it.
You're right, he does look grim.
I always knew he was a quitter
I suppose it was inevitable
Without him around, are we going to live forever?
I told him he never should have taken that holiday.
Do you think grim reapers have their own grimmer reaper?
Well, guess we don't have anything to worry about now.
I told him to look both ways.
do you mind, I'm on my coffin break...
Oh, George, I wish he didn't look so grim.
Well, Herb, we're together for good now.
Death takes a holiday.
Seems like a busman's holiday to me.
He's so dead-like.
I told him that reading John Donne would be too depressing.
So much for professional courtesy.
Well that's ironic
I guess this proves it: what goes around comes around!
It all finally caught up with him.
Why couldn't our son just be a lawyer?
He looks a little warmed over.
Just when I thought my IRA was big enough.
I was really looking forward to our appointment next week.
There must be great sorrow in the funeral industry
Great. Now we're stuck together forever.
If he didn't escape death, I'm assuming he didn't escape taxes either.
I hear his last words were to his apprentice - "You're fired!"
Fake news.
He was very conflicted at the end.
So cliche!
Looks like he tried to reap the wrong person.
Oh look, it's the Great Pretender.
Who wears black to their own funeral?
He doesn't look so smug now.
Life was just too much for him in the end.
It was too dark to see the banana peel.
He loved his work, perhaps a little too much.
He neglected himself until the very end.
That's really grim.
Your big-shot job was no excuse for not visiting your parents.
At some point the cold hand of Trump comes for all of us
No. I haven't a clue what I'm going to do with my new, eternal, god-forsaken life.
She always enjoyed thematic partying.
Well, I guess this means the only certain thing now is taxes
I *warned* him not to drink and scythe.
I can't wait until Forensic Files explains how this happened.
Does this mean we have a President for life now?
Now tell Vinnie to pay Taxes a visit.
Does this mean our premiums will go up?
‘Someone said that he paid a visit, to Chuck Norris’
So many years of lurking...and for what?
RIP...please!
With uncertainty, Millie and Albert decided to pay their respects, but not their taxes.
But he loooks so alive.
Morty thought that dressing like this would fool him, but...
Guess he knew not the time, the hour, nor the overall dimensions.
Actually, things are looking up.
They said it was Skittles.
I guess we're stuck with each other forever, now.
He looks a bit grim don't you think?
Looks like the next international crisis will be overpopulation.
Well.... there goes our inheritance.
Nobody saw this coming.
What did he die of?
I heard he killed himself.
Wow. We are getting really old.
He should never have taken that holiday.
He always over dresses for the occasion.
Now that’s what you call grim.
Death well lived
We need to rethink our lifetime returns policy.
He had a killer personality.
So young, and so full of lives.
I can’t believe he fell for that.
Honey, I don't think they will be able to close the lid.
There is no closure.
He still looks so alive.
Looks like he sowed what he reaped
You know, Morty, we wasted a lot of money on those cemetery plots.
Now you're stuck with me for eternity.
He forgot to bury the hatchet
Holiday...huh...it's about time.
Guess this means we're stuck with taxes.
No, it’s that guy from the cable commercials.
The undertaker seems concerned.
Can't believe he never returned our scythe!!
Death is no longer what it used to be
It was inevitable.
Sometimes death does take a holiday.
I've heard he's being replaced by a drone.
Don't you dare get an open casket for me.
Who do you suppose delivered the news to him?
Why are we the only ones--oh.
He requested to be buried in his hoodie.
Ok, ok, we get it. You're "meta".
Too many trips to the White House just wore him down.
Hmm, peaceful isn't the word I'd use.
I see why today’s hymn is Bringing in the Sheaves.
He looks a little grim.
I guess what goes around, comes around.
I guess this means I'm stuck with you.
It really was a nasty flu season this year.
I guess it wasn't a phase.
We're done here. Now let's go bring sand to the beach.
I heard he was a Blue Dog Democrat
I, for one, am not going to miss hearing him tell us we're cheating him all the time.
Now that there's no more death, I am going to look for a younger man
We told you when you signed up with the Trump administration that it wouldn't last.
Well this is unexpected!
It's true. You reap what you sow.
Herman, tell me this doesn't mean you're never going to die.
It's so sad. He had so much to live for.
I kept telling him he should take a vacation.
He'd fought a courageous battle with irony.
What should we do with our plot now?
I don't remember a single day where he ever smiled.
Does this mean we're stuck together...forever?
First, the tax cut. And now this.
I always thought he’d outlive us all.
He just wouldn’t let go of it.
Not grim enough, apparently.
He looks the same in death as he did in life.
I think it was pride that really did get him in the end .
Shame. He was always the life of the party.
He didn't have a list on him, but some folks do have all the luck.
I never thought he'd end up this way!
Never thought we'd be around long enough to see this.
'The mortician did lovely work. He looks like he's just taking a nap."
You know, he hadn't looked all that well.
The undertaker gave him a frequent die’r discount.
He only had 100 trillion years to go until retirement.
Yes, Alanis, THAT is ironic.
He thinks it's funny.
Funny ... I was planning to rewrite my will, but now I guess I don't have to!
He looked in a mirror.
Irony is ... well, you know.
Well, we can say goodbye to Medicare now.
I have to say, he was the most obnoxious of the Brothers Grim.
I never thought we`d be starring down at death.
I really thought you were going to croak first.
Times up, buddy boy!
I guess you really do reap what you sow...
Well, at least taxes are still certain.
I thought he was capable of anything except irony.
He took his own life.
Well, I guess the laugh's on him.
Apparently his employer didn’t offer health insurance.
My, doesn’t he look so life-like.
You live by the scythe, you die by the scythe.
How morbidly redundant!
Well, there goes another meme.
Well, "be not proud" is what I must say. With apologies to John Donne, of course.
Remind me to call the kids. Now I'm thinking our IRAs are not going to last us.
Well, I have to say he looks good
There’s a tough act to follow!
I never thought he would go before us.
I thought he looked a little sickle.
Funny - he doesn't look peaceful at all!
I’m going to miss his sense of humor.
He always loved irony!
It's always a shock when they "go" unexpectedly.
I still can't believe it. He was just around the corner.
He always tests it first.
I guess this is what it means when they say Death takes a holiday!
If you ask me, he had it coming.
He lived a good death.
Well, this proves it. You reap what you sew.
You know, they can't actually bury him with the sickle? Insurance rules ...
I always thought we’d go first.
I always told you Aunt Bertha had a dark side.
And they say, 'you can't take it with you
I guess we won...
So I keep telling him, 'You look awful. You really have to take another holiday'. But did he listen? ...
You know what they say, "Live by the sythe, die by the sythe."
it's about to get very crowded, everywhere
Isn't that redundant.....
I was sure your mother would outlive us all.
I thought his future was looking grim.
Who's scything now?
He was an upholsterer for a casket company. I guess he's reaping what he sewed.
Looks like death warmed over to me.
He looks less grim than I remember him.
Apparently, it was a suicide
What a relief he is gone!
He always had a dark sense of humor.
You know what he used to say "go knock em dead!"
I wish we'd put more into our 401K.
Some people say it was an accident ... he tripped over his own scythe. But I think it was self-reaping.
Did he name a successor?
That leaves the IRS as the only thing we can be certain about on this earth.
I'll be damned...even He reaps what he sowed!
The lack of space in these things is a real killer.
I suppose this means he paid taxes too.
Sure, I appreciate the irony. But what happens to us now?
He's practicing empathy.
She leaves four hungry children and a crop in the field.
Didn't he know? You can't take it with you.
Well that's a grim message. You sow what you reap.
Well, this surely wins the Irony Olympics.
Does this mean we're doomed to go on living?
Stubborn guy. I warned him: He who lives by the scythe....
He's been dying to take this sabbatical,
I kept after him to retire ; but he just wouldn’t listen.
I guess the archbishop got there first.
I always thought it was a guy.
... and then I said, “son, you need to get a life”.
Would it have killed him to die forty years earlier?
Did he leave a note?
Sow, what are you reaping now?
He’s a natural.
Geeze; you can't even tell it's him.
I thought he'd look a lot paler.
Oh dear; now the only certain thing in this world is taxes.
Remind me to reconsider our retirement financial plans
If Billy Graham can lie in state I guess he can too.
He looks so .... redundant.
Reaper in Peace, finally!
The only one left is taxes
Isn't it ironic
I guess taxes will be the next to go...
If I had known this was going to happen, I never would have given up BASE jumping.
Was he ever alive?
Sooner or later it happens to everyone. Death Trump and Taxes.
He finally looks like himself.
No such luck. He's just taking a busman's holiday.
He always looked so scary in life.
It's grim, but he reaped what he sowed.
OK; break time’s over; back on the floor!
well, he certainly got the most out of life
This can't be good for business?!
His friends say he took his own life.
His job killed him.
And yet, he never filed a tax return.
I tried to warn him about being so proud . . .
I guess Death did need Life support
Incredible, he looks so death-like.
Gosh, I thought he was immortal.
They did a good job. He looks just as he did
I told him his job would kill him.
I'm glad they went with the robe. It's all anyone ever saw him in.
Death becomes her.
It's been ruled a suicide.
I never thought he would be the first to go.
He died doing his job. Just like I knew he would.
He looks so death-like lying there.
His final words were "I've been cheated for the last time!"
Don't ask. My brother always had a strange sense of humor.
My Harold. He was such a people person.
He believed in his product.
What a tragedy, and just before tax day.
I know it's the most luxurious coffin ever built, but we cannot afford to keep the place if you don't get back to work!
Karma's a bitch, ain't it?
I told him not to touch himself.
I wonder if he has to pay the death tax.
. . . only thing left now is taxes.
That was Harry's favorite Halloween costume.
I didn't even know he was sickle.
Sorry dear, but after this our funeral home is going kaput.
No, that is not the true definition of 'ironic.'
He always seemed depressed
After the tax bill, this was inevitable.
I'd know that face anywhere. It's the Grim Sleeper!
He took his own death.
He didn't get his flu shot.
To be honest, I really had my hopes on “till death do us part”...
He affected so many lives.
Someone finally scared Death to death.
I was hoping not to live through this presidency.
I'll distract them, you grab the scythe
O death, where is thy sting?
Is this the end of life as we know it?
I told you not to pre-pay for your funeral.
Does this mean I can stop taking my blood pressure pills?
The good news Martha, we can now live forever... the bad news? We have enough money for about five more years.
We were friends on Facebook.
I guess we should have bought that long-term health care policy.
It truly was his favorite outfit.
He's scared to death of Trump's presidency
Apparently he was an Eagles fan.
I thought he was already dead !
I wonder how Billy Graham would have explained this.
So does this mean we're definitely going to die, or that we'll never die?
I heard he wasn't prepared for the repeal of death taxes.
I guess I'll renew my subscription to the Times.
He forgot to ask for eternal life.
Hey Reaper, wake up! You got unfinished business here.
I see they went for the Classic Majesty model. Someone must have loved him.
Look at that! Even Death had a rendezvous.
This explains why we saw so little of Charlie on the weekends.
He was such a good guy
I'm cancelling our burial plan.
It’s grim alright.
Too bad--he really lived for his job!
And he did such a good job on the lawn.
I think we just discovered the secret to immortality.
Now what are we supposed to wish for?
Just in time, wouldn't you say?
Finally, the end of death taxes.
It really becomes him.
Well, we knew he had some kind of extra income, but who knew?
...and I heard he didn’t have life insurance.
Well, that's the end of death as we know it.
We agreed to toss for it
Donne was really onto something.
It's amazing how Death-like he looks.
why didn’t they put him in his formal cloak?
Another example of "Fake News"
He really should have paid his taxes.
These goth kids are getting more and more creative.
He always loved my liver and onions.
He certainly looks grim to me.
And now that they've passed a tax cut, I can't be sure of anything anymore.
Self-referential.
He loved that Scythe so much; do you think there’s a way to fit it into his coffin?
Do you think they're hiring now?
Not being able to escape death was actually better than not being able to escape life.
Can't wait to see HIS epitaph.
Shut up Harold! We ARE older than death!
Uh-oh, how are we gonna stretch our nest-egg into forever?
It was the grimmest of funerals
He makes it look so easy.
Well, he never did take a holiday.
we may have to rethink whether or not our retirement savings are still sufficient
Now that Death is dead I want a divorce.
"My worst nightmare has come true.We're going to outlive our money".
I really wish I didn’t buy that funeral home.
It looks grim
Let's call the accountant make sure we need to file this year.
Well he can't take that scythe with him.
I guess it's our last one of these for a while.
I told him he should have retired earlier.
He’s just getting a feel for it.
It’s not really surprising...death becomes him.
Well, Dear, looks as though he went down reaping, at least.
It killed him that the A-15 was more efficient.
My brother was always the life of the party.
...the salmon mousse?
Does this mean we can cancel our supplemental insurance?
I warned him not to take on the IRS. The only thing more certain than Death is Taxes.
Is this considered deadpan or irony?
Hey. Hey! Get out! What are you? Deaf?
oh fuck yes
I knew his commitment to the role would mean the end.
He thought he was the only one.
So what goes around really does come around!
Funny, he looks just like he always did.
He called it a Grim Reaper Sleeper.
I guess this means that over population is now a real concern.
I’ve never seen him smile before.
Sad, but it happens to the worst of us.
Time to revisit our retirement planning assumptions.
He looks so content. Usually he is pretty grim.
I guess we'll be here for awhile.
I told you he was older than death itself.
This settles it, Mort. We're getting that divorce.
These open coffins will be the death of me.
I rarely get to reap the benefits of my job.
I guess I always thought it was going to be taxes.
He never seemed full of life.
He probably hasn't worn that since his wedding.
Who is going to run the DNC now?
I thought only God was dead.
We might make it to 100.
"Live by the scythe," as they say.
We're going to have to make some big changes to our retirement plan. Now we're definitely going to outlive our money. He worked himself to death. He worked right up to the end.
That was his favorite scythe.
And we thought he was just going through a phase.
You can take it with you.
We were just discussing karma the other day.
Is this some sort of a double negative or an ironic statement?
'I wonder if he had death insurance.'
He died the way he lived.
I don't recall his religious affiliation.
I heard he got a discount.
Dead is dead.. What can we believe now?
He tried to touch Chuck Norris.
Really? I thought of him more as a realist.
His wife is really being a grim weeper.
He will not be missed.
I mean I guess this is great for our insurance rates?
I told you, you reap what you sow.
I guess he saw it coming.
"We must stay to hear Mr. LaPierre's eulogy.
Damn! He beat me to it.
I understand, Mr Death, HOW to use a coffin.. I just don't see what you have against cremation!
There was a problem loading the caption. Please try again later.
"You've made your bed, now lie in it".
I don’t envy the guy who has to close the coffin.
I'm thinking cremation.
He looks so baneful. They did a wonderful job.
He looks so deadlike ...
That's karma for you.
He never really saw this coming.
They did a great job. He looks so natural.
The mortician did a beautiful job
And then, when I went to get the photo album, he just dropped over.
I wonder how he felt about taxes
Oh my dear, how can we go on living without you?
Doesn't he look like himself?
He scoffed at #metoo, I hit him with #benotproud, and now he's #doa.
I understand all that survivor's guilt finally got to him.
I understand he left no "next of kin."
He never lost his flare for the dramatic.
I wish Alanis Morissette could see this...
You can't say he went down without a fight.
It's enough to make the angels reap
They cancelled his SNL gig.
Suicide. The job finally got to him.
He passed from despair. His first failure - he couldn't get past the barrage of tweets.
I told them it should be a closed casket!
He should have known better than to try and take down Chuck Norris.
It can't be "Til Death do us part" already, can it honey?
Hmm- He looks so grim, just like always.
Oh, great. Now that Death is gone, it looks like I'm stuck with you forever.
I love Gary Larson.
And I still say he's a selfish bastard.
He said he was feeling sick, but I misunderstood. I though he was talking about his sickle.
I thought he was just on a holiday.
Turns out even he couldn’t escape taxes.
What a shame. He never got to meet the Kiss of Death.
Hmmm...now what do you think they will threaten us with to get us to comply?
Time is finally up for Father Time.
It's selfish, but I feel better knowing he won't be dropping by unexpectedly anymore.
I wouldn't call that a holiday.
His job really took a toll.
I understand that was his favorite scythe.
He hadn't been himself since Easter Sunday.
Well, the position is open if you want to get promoted, dear.
They say it all started with a selfie gone awry
The Grim Sower got to him.
Maybe I shouldn't have told him to be more like himself.
Well, Ernie, it looks like we're going to be alive and together forever.
It was only a matter of time.
I don’t know. Smells like a trap.
THIS is what irony means.
Don't you hate being a CPA this time of year, Frank? It's the same old thing...death and taxes. Wouldn't you know it, after all these years, the poor guy was finally getting a refund.
Does this mean we'll live forever Harold?
Does this mean that we will have to live forever?
Death, be not proud. Death, thou shalt die. You should have listened to John Donne.
Is it too much to hope that taxes are next?
He said his work here was done.
I think his heart gave out when he realized Hell is just a relative term right now...
Is this a funeral or fancy dress?
I don't think they got the mouth right...
So much for taxes and death.
And they did a great job; he doesn't look so . . . grim.
Think I’ll go ahead and pre-cross skydiving off my bucket list.
They suspect suicide.
I was hoping it would be the taxman instead.
I guess this place is going out of business.
He always did scythe outside of the box.
How many times did we say, "Swing with both hands . . . don't get cocky."
Reap no more!
I sure hope Taxes are next.
He touched so many lives - and then they were over.
He looks a little grim.
Well, dead is dead.
He tried to take Trump.
I guess we're now immortal.
I can't believe he died before we did.
The least of it is how're they gonna close the lid.
He doesn’t look all that grim to me.
...and another traditional craft enterprise running out of business...
I didn't know our taste in music was that bad
Does this mean we get to live forever?
Honestly, the open casket just seems like he's mocking us
Two things I believe: karma, and irony
He always had a hard time making friends.
He looked good for his age.
At least now I can eat whatever I want without him breathing down my neck.
Evidently Phil's act didn't fool everyone.
Sad. He has no sons to take over the business.
So now we're stuck in Trump World forever?
Now all that's certain in life are taxes.
Personally, I think it's overkill.
A one-percenters second-fondest dream. Now for taxes.
I warned him about not paying his taxes.
Just say it, Harold. I should have contributed more to the 401(k).
I meant the costume — it’s a rental.
Our retirement plan didn't anticipate this.
I mourn the loss of an agrarian society too. But it was no way to live your life.
Well this funerals pretty Grimm
Karma is like an ax to the head.
They were right when they said he was hanging on like grim death.
Wakey wakey, time to improve our bottom line.
I sure hope Taxes are next.
He's never looked less grim.
What did you expect, a celebration of life?
It seems like just yesterday when he came for Mom.
Well Maude, does this mean we’re stuck here?
One less sure thing. You can't depend on anything these days.
He reapeth
Well Romeo, looks like now we're together in eternity.
He never could do anything right.
They say he just gave up when people stopped taking him seriously...

Well, his doctor did tell him that if he didn't take it easy at work it would kill him.
I thought retirement would last 20 or 30 years tops. Boy, was I wrong.

It was the salmon mousse.
Well, I guess that made that whole "repeal the death tax" thing pointless.
He always did look like death.
Does this mean we're going to live forever?
It was a scything accident.
He looks so well. Not a year over two million.
Actually, he got what he came for.
So, "til death do us part" means ....
I can't say I'm shocked. He always had a death wish.
He really looks like death itself.
Do we have enough in our savings to live forever now?
And I thought I was dead tired.
I thought you would go first.
He looks just like himself.
Tax reform, and now this. I'm not certain about anything anymore.
Another victim of health care.
He always appreciated irony.
Once again, dear, you are confusing coincidence with irony.
He's just taking a busman's holiday.
Good news, Nietzsche got the wrong guy.
Dead, he doesn't look so grim.
They must have found a replacement
Ya gotta love that Randy. Even in death, he said it loud, he said it shroud.
Well, that clinches it: Death was not Jewish.
It must have been the canned salmon.
Does this mean we’re good.
You wouldn’t hear from him for years, and then all of a sudden he’s be at your door.
He looks so death-like.
I wouldn't say he looks lifelike but it's better than I expected.
Oh dear, we just lost our ride.
Yes, I'm sure it's comfortable, what's your point?
He played chess with your mother.
Well, this is a make lemonade moment.

Towards the end he gave up harvesting souls and mowed lawns for free
No one tell the teens.
He was killin' it during his illustrious run.
I told him to be careful with his new selfie scythe.
He's off to a better place.
I tell you what this means.... We don't have enough saved for retirement anymore.
Mother always said - be careful with sharp objects.
Do you still believe we saved enough for retirement?
He was my favorite actor on Days of our Scythes.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit
Given the Law of Karma, I see another grim future for him.
Did he say "I'll be back"?
He looks so peaceful.
"You reap what you sow" doesn't quite say it.
I guess his karma finally caught up with him.
Oh my, how are they going to close the casket?
I thought he was joking.
Another Casualty of "Me Too"...
Gluten is the real killer here
I suppose taxes can't be avoided either.
I wondered why he was late to see us.
I guess this is the last of the grim reaper cartoons in the New Yorker!
They say he worked himself to death.
There goes your mother's insurance.
So does this mean we're immortal now?
Well, on the bright side, at least we still have taxes.
Is it just me or does Fred look like "death warmed over"?
I know he carried that scythe everywhere he went, but would it have killed them to put a suit and tie on him instead?
I wonder if now we will live forever ?
I knew he was sick, but a SICKle in his coffin is overkill.
Well, that’s about as dead dead can be.
So grim, it's like he's still with us.
Who knew
Suicide! He couldn’t handle being out-grimmed by the Trump Administration.
I can't choose between ironic or oxymoronic.
It had to happen. The only thing certain and all that.
If HE'S dead, our money won't last.
Mortimer, this is fake news in three dimensions
Maury always said he was knocking on deaths door.
John Donne said it would happen, but I never thought I'd actually see it.
There goes our Medicare.
Well.... happens to the best of us.
I knew we should have bought a bigger casket.
He was dying to be here
This isn't the first time we've cheated death.
You'd think he would have known he can't take it with him.
Herb, did he ever look sickel to you?
Our poor, poor boy. Even in death he doesn't fit in.
Wake up, son! I know you're tired, but Congress has decided to ignore gun control issues until after the midterms.
Kind of ironic that a Jewish carpenter did him in with a nail.

HE WOULD LOOK BETTER WITH HIS HEAD ATTACHED.
I did NOT see that coming.
He always was a little grim.
I guess we’ll never really know death
Herb always had a good sense of humor.
I didn’t think he would EVER die!
- and yet he still looks so grim and reaper-like!

It is just like him to be sleeping on the job
The doctors said that he'd live forever... How they lie...
I guess we have time to plant those acorns.
Say what you will, he looks good.
You said, “until hell freezes over.” Well?
"He was good at his job, but the competition was deadly".
He had a mean right hook.
Funny, but he looks so lifelike.
Well, I suppose now our 401(k) needs to last forever...
Death at a funeral.
He looks so natural. But I guess you would expect that of him.
He'll be in a worse place.
He always put others before himself.
I told you he wouldn't go down without a fight
See, folks? It’s not that bad.
I do not understand this cartoon
I thought you would go first.
Does this mean we can stop paying or Medicare premium?
Be not Proud.
Think we can cancel our cryopreservation contract now?
He always said if you can't beat him, join him.
I said, "We'd never be rid of him.."
I don't know, he just looks so grim !
I didn't expect him to look so alive.
Our retirement fund does NOT account for this!
Jack, can you call the estate lawyer. I want a refund.
I don't think most people really understood him.
Maybe a working vacation but I knew that he couldn't handle a holiday.
Turn about, fair play.
I never thought he would go before us - or anyone else for that matter.
His accomplishments were breathtaking.
I never thought he'd be the first to go.
Well, I don't know what this means for the rest of us, but I certainly see the irony.
I always told him, "he who lives by the scythe, dies by the scythe"
He looks really grim.
Well, that’s that!
Maybe we should’ve seen it coming.
The job got to him.
It's going to get awfully crowded.
Tit for tat!
Sure as hell didn't expect him to predecease us. Better call our planner.
Heck! I didn't even know he was sick.
Now even Death's robes are made in China.
He never closed a door or lowered a toilet seat - even if it killed him!
He never took a vacation.
The hoodie certainly stands the test of time.
He always had a negative outlook on life.
After centuries of "I am death", this is what he gets for one "I am dead".
Death did us part.
Things must have really gotten out of hand in the White House.
Looks like death warmed over to me.
... and I understand, there were no suspicious circumstances.
Wow, it really does become her!
He really does look like he's just sleeping.
He said he felt like Death
So, the old bastard finally got himself!
He wasn't a very lively person anyways.
Shouldn't we be happier, George?
He should have just bought term care.
So, you're saying he came for himself?
He loved his work but the stress killed him.
I always thought I'd go before he did.
Nothing feels certain any more.
You'd think he would have seen that truck coming.
Maybe we can re-brand as an ice cream parlour?
So, this SuperDeath who killed him -- SuperDeath is probably a nice guy, right?
Great job.He looks the same.
Such a vicious cycle.
It was the only way he could avoid paying taxes.
OMG, do we now have to live forever? I can't handle any more new I-Phones.
Well, how am I going to die now.
Time waits for no man...unless he was waiting for the inheritance tax law to change.
I warned you to be not proud
I’m not surprised, lately he has looked like death.
He looks terribly grim, don't you think?
Well, looks like we're in it for the long hall now.
I heard his job was killing him.
I never thought he'd be the first to go.
Compliments to the mortician -- Graham looks so death-like.
I feel like I never really got to know him.
I know what the manual says about picking up hitchhikers but he looks okay to me.
Does this mean we're off the hook?
He actually wanted to be buried with his sand wedge.
It's no surprise, he didn't avoid taxes either.
He seems so natural!
Not proud now, is he?
I guess this validates the expression “you reap what you sow.”
I told him you can't eat Bacon at every meal, but he said he would live forever.
Easily the most obvious Undercover Boss episode I've seen yet.
I remember him in Venice.
He always did know how to just be himself.
Here he lies, in all his glory, the Grim Sleeper.
Well, it's about time!
He won't be missed.
What a shame; he had such a lovely singing voice.
Guess that mean's we're safe.
We may live and live and live to regret this.
I told you I was going to live forever.
He was into his job way too much.
CDC director suicide was reported as accidental...
Does this mean we're off the hook for taxes?
I didn't realize the world had gotten this Grim.
Another Grimm fairy tail
Bill loved costumes! He thought the scythe made him look taller.
I hate irony.
So the terrorists win.
It was suicide.
I guess he had it coming to him.
So.....it looks like we're done here.
Does this mean that we’ll be going on forever?
I really thought he would look happier.
I'm overwhelmed... by schadenfreude.
My God, he looks so natural.
I always said Saul’s dark humor would be the end of him.
And to think, just last week we were all sitting around discussing irony.
See—the Devil doesn’t wear Prada!
Well, John Donne called it.
We should have opted for a closed casket.
I think he looks rather dapper.
After Trump was elected, he realized there were no rules anymore.
Have you already paid the hit man?
He never did pay taxes!
Well, they always say, "Death to death."
He's just trying it out to get a "feel" for his job.
So that leaves just you at my funeral.
He almost looks like he's dead.
He would be remembered by more people if he didn't kill so many of them.
Harold, I want a divorce.
Does this mean no more death? Cancel the gym membership, and let's get over to Taco Bell before the line gets too long.
The mortician did a nice job, he still looks so full of life!
He never seemed the Super Scythe Me type.
He never did look life-like.
All I said was DROP DEAD and he did.
And so young—he had his whole non-life ahead of him.
I guess the advent of the self-assured baby boomers was too much for him to handle.
Suicide? I thought he was looking a little grim.
I told him that Halloween costume was a bad idea.
Sad, but you reap what you sow.
My, the mortician did such a wonderful job. He looks so unnatural.
Poor Donald Trump - that's what you get for pissing Putin off!
Who'd a thought?
Well, I guess I shouldn't have bought that life insurance policy
"As ye sow so shall ye reap." Grim but right on.
I thought he'd outlive us all.
I get the feeling that somehow politicians are to blame for this.
Don't fear the reaper--more cowbell!
Brought down by his own scyth.
He loved life.
Obit says no family. Anyone who would try to get close to him, well, you know...
Should we have gone with his Little League uniform?
Why did they make him look so grim?
I apologize . I didn't think it would be a open casket as part of the deluxe 'Mother-in -Law' package.
Talk about a mid-life crisis!
Well this visit is an unexpected turn of events.
He and Life were actually quite close.
I am told it was suicide.
THIS IS CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED.
Scythe matters! Scythe matters!
Is that the best suit you could find?
I just wish death had died when I was younger.
Is irony dead?
It’s too bad the stress finally got to him, but we were afraid to tell him to cut back.
Schmuck.
A Busman's holiday I suppose.
I guess we need to build that mother-in-law suite now.
Karma really is a thing!
So there's something even worse than him?
He always looked dead.
I think he should have gone with ashes rather than the casket. You know, 'Death warmed over.'
Let’s hit the road before his relatives show up.
Does this mean we're going to live forever?
This funeral is really grim.
He was proud he discovered Chaos Theory, but it was too much for him when it took over the White House.
I feel like a mallard flying over a duck blind.
I'm surprised to see him dressed in uniform.
He use to put the fun in funerals
Department of redundancy department.
He always hoped to reap what he sowed !
Harold was never a subtle man.
I'm afraid that marital parting is no longer possible.
Well I guess it's true -- reap what you sow!
We'll never get the lid closed with that fucking scythe in the way.
I was standing my ground. He's the one who thought he could come to Florida.
He was always so into himself.
And we thought we would be the first to go.
Once he had taken Taxes, he must have known this was coming.
Welp, I'd say that's check-mate.
Grim? I always saw him as more of the strong silent type.
"They say he killed himself to death".
I told you the funeral home business didn't have a future.
I guess this is where death did us part.
'He always acted like he should have the final word. And he was terribly judgmental."
He was always good in bed.
Dang! I always thought I'd go first.
No matter how many times I asked, he never would change that robe.
He looks just the same.
His grandma knitted that for him...right before he killed her.
He looks so peaceful; and redundant.
How the tables are turned!
Jack likes to sleep here. He says it helps him understand his customers better.
He doesn't look grim at all. Just overworked and underappreciated.
He looks so peaceful, not grim at all...
What? He promised me that scythe!
Whenever he met someone, he'd always say: Don't ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.
He was really a lot of fun, once you got to know him.
He can finally rest in peace knowing the NRA will continue the work.
This poor guy really reaped what he sowed
Do you think he's really dead or just napping?
And I thought we'd go first.
Not so grim...
He looks like he could just get up and step out of the casket.
I believe the correct word is 'funereal.'
Wow, I really thought he'd outlive us all.
It's hard to believe he died on our doorstep.
As they say, you reap what you sow.
She always dressed for the occasion.
Death took a holiday again.
They say he had tax problems
This reminds me of that riddle, you know, about when there's only one barber in town, who cuts the barber's hair?

I told the mortician "the prim, cheaper suit."
I told him that partying so hard would be the death of him.
He was always so grim.
I thought you said god was dead.
It's true, Harold------you reap what you sow.
It kills me to think of the money we threw away on life insurance.
It's always so sad. And who's going to take over the family business?
He never knew what hit him.
Let's hope there's no such thing as reincarnation.
He looks so innocent when he's sleeping.
Like all great leaders he didn't see it coming; I understand he neglected to name a successor.
Jerry, it's time to get up.
Apparently, he had poor time management skills.
I think they could have done better with the skin tone.
He looks warmed-over.

Does this mean we have to live forever?
He should have known not to take a mirror selfie.
He looks so natural.
Another one bites the dust.
Poor Grim. I think he got ripped off on the casket.

The Social Security Administration is asking for a second opinion.
I wonder who came to see him?
Look at our son Jack, the Reaper.
Don't worry - that's just where he sleeps.
Even he came out on the short end trusting the President.
Apparently it was self inflicted.
Now, aren't you glad you listened to me when I told you to get the flu vaccine?
I find it ironic that he had scheduled his retirement party next week.
what a waste of talent
Talk about coals to Newcastle . . .
Death takes a holiday ... for eternity.
He was never there for me. Of course I cheated.
He looks so natural and death-like.
Who knew all I had to do was ask to switch places.
#timesup
I think Harvey went off the rails when he started calling his backhand " The Grim Reaper " !
I guess that the sith made a closed casket impossible.
Don't worry, Momma. Our son's just on his morning Coffin Break.
And we always thought we would go before him.
I know I shouldn't be speaking ill - but he was some son of a bitch
Does this mean we don’t have to pay our taxes
"I always knew he had a dark sense of humor...we're immortal and I'm 90!'
I wouldn't have offered him almond biscotti if I had known about his nut allergy
Guess death IS the great equalizer.
He just couldn't watch another season of The Bachelor.
I suppose we have to live forever now.
So, he finally retired.
I'm worried about him. He never used to need a nap in the middle of the work day.
Darling, you didn't use canned salmon, did you?
No, Jonathan, you are on your own here. We're not coming with you.
He looks like he's still dead.
That last joke killed him.
Well, they say revenge is best served cold!
'Stay away from Larry King,' I said. But he wouldn't listen.
And he didn't even get a chance to visit the White House. Sad!
There was a problem loading the caption. Please try again later.
We can hope.
Too bad. Dude could mow some wheat.
They couldn't have dressed him in something less grim?
Well, I guess trying to gather up those Millennials drove him to do it.
Never thought I’d live to see the day!
A victim of rebranding
Do you suppose he had a pre payment plan ?
I wonder why no one came to the funeral?
He probably left a number of jobs unfinished. By the way, Harvey, how is your mother’s cough?
Ed always did have a sense of humor.
What will the White House do NOW !
We played chess. I beat him three out of three.
I hope he’s burning in hell.
I suppose this means that we can cancel our Life Insurance.
Those who believe in the personification of death can issue a scythe of relief.
Look honey, another death in the family.
Only a visit from Bob Mueller was scarier than a visit from the Grim Reaper.
Sure it's an impressive funeral, but the future doens't look good for the industry
His sense of ironic humor has a dark side.
Death looks good on him.
It also means that we wasted money on that estate lawyer.
I’m sure he’s just playing dead.
And I thought I knew everything about your brother.
Was it our fault?
Well Wilber, You were right he was no match for you.
If this gives us a few more years, we should rebalance the portfolio.

Do unto others, ....
Some will call it 'career suicide'.

They're still cheating death? He paid for a One Scythe Fits All casket you know.
I heard he didn't see it coming.
I always said—You need to eat. Put some meat on your bones.
I guess Death doesn't play favorites. How ironic.
So, does this mean we're good?
He doesn't look much different now than he looked at the Christmas party.
Now what happens to the rest of us?
The irony of infinite regress!
Poor dear, his job is killing him.
Welp, I guess we're married forever.
I told you, we should've applied for better life insurance company.
DYI has really reached a peak.
But I don't want to live forever.
They say it was a bowl of cherries that did him in.
He wanted to re-brand himself, and I guess this is one was to go about it.
Stupid Reaper should have been more careful! These days you never know who’s carrying.
Well, it just makes sense to me. He was always a "do it himself" boy.
Looks like we beat death.
He was just standing on his own doorstep-- who knew?
You never know when it's time to go. Taxes may be next.
He had so much more left to take.
lt all seems so final.
Well, he did say that he was a klutz.
He was cut down in his prime.
He died from exhaustion. No one bothered to tell him that cats had nine lives.

That lid won't close now.
This is what democracy looks like.
Apparently, you CAN take it with you.
He looks like he did when he was dead.
I heard he froze to death after the election.
He was looking less grim ever day.
He seemed so full of life
See, I kept telling you just hold and we would have the last laugh
Does he really think he can dig his way out of a hole with that?
Crap. Does that mean we're all stuck here now?
It's the definition of redundant.
He loved to bring his work home with him.
Sleeping on the job!
Struck down by lightening, go figure!
Periodically he likes to sample the results of his work. We allow it though it weirds out the new employees. It’s kind of a rite of passage.
The downside is, now our savings may not last.
The sickle's extra.
Well, I guess he's reaped his final sheaf.
But the bad news is, of course, that we're now immortal.
I told him not to ware his huddy when crossing the street.
So is this the death of meta, or the meta of death?
He just doesn't look like himself.
I guess we’ll have to reschedule.
I'm sorry Helen, but technically I have to rule it a suicide.
How could he be so stupid?
He's not sleeping. He's waiting.
For years we warned him--you reap what you sow.
So does this mean there's a job opening?
Well so much for 'to death do us part'
Was there only one of him?
I’ve always found wakes to be a little grim.
Et tu, Brute?
He had such a full life.
Mr. Big Shot. He shoulda stayed in the uncle's funeral business.

I never feared death. I fear an eternity of mediocrity.
Clearly, he took his work too seriously.
How sweet. Back in his old bed.
One less worry, let's cancel our life insurance.
I hear his replacement carries an AR-15.
I'm afraid death comes to us all.
He came for my soul so I put him in a hole.
'He doesn't look so grim.'
He lived a good long death.
John had such a morbid sense of humor.
Reaper, Peeper Bo Peeper, Banana Fanna Bo Beeper, Fi Fy Bo Eeper, Reaper!!
I'd say you got the better of him, Fred.
I told him that he'd only reap what he sowed, if he didn't change his ways!
Well, this is meta.
He looks so peaxeful when he’s sleeping...
Your brother sure can talk his way out of anything.
Well, okay, let's get a dog then.
Sell all my funerary business holdings.
Yes, he had his faults, but he was great in bed.
This was his Halloween get-up. I heard if he made it til Christmas, he had a full Santa outfit picked out.
Boogie always loved Halloween, though the kid took everything so serioulsly.
#timesup
He hung on like grim death.
We should have taken better care of ourselves.
Poetic justice.
Killing time takes on a whole new meaning after 70.
He never could keep the job from getting personal.
He got more than he gave.
He'd never let go of his "blankie" either.
The Bible was right Revelation 21:4 said said death would be no more
Damn it Frank, we've outlived death himself
His new contact gives him two coffin breaks per day.
I told him that he'll be taking you over my, or his own dead body.
I still don't trust him, he looks like he's sleeping.
This model can only be ordered in black
Does this mean we're going to be here forever!?
Work, work, work. That's all he did.
I guess this means I have to go back and get a job.
Be careful, I think he's faking it.
He must have messed up with the boss...
Well, I guess he felt the reaper after all.
Now, we'll never get social security!
He told Trump, over his dead body.
Didn't I tell you that with that coffin you'd catch your death.
I guess this means we can cancel our life insurance
He always worked too much.
Business must be pretty slow today.
Look honey...he's fallen and he can't get up.
He was always such a happy child.
So now what is to become of us?
I hope this doesn't mean we're doomed to eternal life.
Well, I guess we all have to go sometime.
Always the smarty. Ok its a better halloween costume than that mess you wore last year.
I thought that when he died we had seen the last of his Bergman obsession.
He had it coming.
“Redundant, Harry.’
That’ so grim!
He looks a bit vacant.
I mean, I warned him the cake was to die for...
He never took that holiday he talked about so often.
What can we say about death that hasn't already been said?
Well, I'll be...who would have thought?
I hope this doesn't mean we have to live forever the way we look now.
Do you want to call in sick?
Should I tell the passengers the tilapia on tonight’s menu was a little off?
He killed himself to save others—a true hero.
I knew it would come to this, as he was 'coughin' too much.
He's always sleeping on the job.
I told him he'd eventually work himself to death!
I guess we should sell our life insurance.
Only he will really know if this outfit confuses Hades.
Does that mean one of us never gets the chance to be happy again?
His job finally caught up with him in the end.
There wasn't anyone home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and he couldn't deliver the message.
I warned him that I'm really good at rocks-paper-scissors.
We didn't buy enough health insurance for immortality.
The doctors said he died from natural causes, but technically it was suicide."
Remarkable how natural he looks, isn't it?
He looked in a mirror.
What a relief, Agnes. Now, we can on living without fear.
Does this mean you're immortal now, Henry?
This is a Venus flytrap thing, isn’t it?
Does this mean I'm stuck with you forever?
I don’t like it.
I understand it was quite sudden and really unexpected.
I told him to get off the lawn.
They made him look so grim.
What's that line about reaping what you sow?
I know how you feel. I just lost my little Chihuahua
How terribly grim - he is now the Self Reaper.
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
Bob always thought he would out-live death.
It's the ultimate KARMA
I think it’s one of those new do it yourself funerals.
And he promised to cut the tall weeds next Thursday
He doesn't look so grim now.
Poor fellow -- I guess he was just on a suicide mission.
With all that makeup, he kinda looks like our butcher.
Bless him, he was never proud...
For an extra 300$ we can extend the coffin to fit your scythe.
It is sad, but it's comforting to see that he still looks so deathlike.
Looks like he met his match!
It’s his best suit. It’s his only suit.
His past has finally caught up with him.
He scythed and just keeled over !
He was always such an overachiever.
I think that's my missing pillow case.
Well, I just don’t know! What does happen when Death dies?
Donne warned him about the pride thing.
I told him to stay away from me.
Must have been a helluva fight.
I didn't think he'd take a chess game so seriously!
Is it too early to talk about scythe control?
So this is where the Grim Reaper takes his naps!
I always wondered what he actually did for a living. He only said some sort of environmental cleanup service.
Now, THAT'S death!
How long before they hire his replacement?
Does this mean we all have to pay inheritance tax?
Guess he finally answered his own call.
Nice of him to show up.
A little solipsistic, don't you think?
Well..now I guess anything goes!!!
Forget it. He's fine. That's Howard from 3G. In the building we call him the "Grim Sleeper".
Is this anything like what the grandkids mean when they say "It's so meta"?
How will we ever go without him?
Does this mean we outlive our savings?
Good riddance.
Am I dreaming of him or he is dreaming of us?
And that is why you should never be yourself.
I kept telling him, you reap what you sow, but he never listened.
You first.
Fine time to lie down on the job.
This wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t worn out his welcome at the hospital.
He's trying it on for size for you.
He was a cut above everyone else.
Just think, we could have bought his life insurance policy for almost nothing.
And the memorial service the IRS is next door.
Death at a funeral.
I wonder if his beard and fingernails will keep growing.
She looks almost alive.
Halloween will never be the same.
To think he was always pro-life.
Guess he didn't own a suit.
To think we just bought our life policy.
A weed whacker would have fit, but he said it would ruin his image.
Should we notify his next of grim?
Well, things won't be that different. There still be taxes.
You realize it was the GMOs in the wheat.
He was so misunderstood.
I take back my criticism of your choice to have a full-length mirror on our front door.
He's snoring
He wouldn't listen when I told him his shtick would dissolve into irony.
Worst of it is he made a bet with Larry King.
She: What the devil did he die from? He: Beats the hell out of me.
Would you two please just let me rest?
It was an accident.
I don't think the hood is appropriate for the occasion.
I never really liked him anyway.
I suppose this is what they mean by a good death.
Isn’t that double jeopardy?
Are we off the hook now?
You must have the wrong Finkelsteins. We were just browsing.
He died as he lived --a tragic Death
His last job.
I guess this is the end "'til death do us part."
Republicans unveil healthcare reform with Diorama...
They say Breitbart doesn't want him back.
For him it's just a dress rehearsal.
Doris said that all last year, he was he was eating a pint of Chunky Monkey at night.
Charlie's acting over dramatic as usual!
Max von Sydow lost a chess match.
What a Slacker!
He would have wanted it this way
He heard that Billy Graham died.
Chrissy always had a flair for drama
At least we still have taxes
How the hell are they going to close his casket?
I'm afraid if we don't pick him he'll give us a bad Uber rating.
I thought we asked him to not sneak up on us.
Does this mean I'm stuck with you for eternity?
Great job! I know - he looks so Death-like...
He must have run into his twin brother !
I told him not to franchise.
I guess he knew this was coming.
Well, I guess this is good news for us.
The missus always thought she'd go first.
Finally got a taste of his own medicine.
They say that even the plumber's faucet leaks at home
Not enough kills. They say it was sickle cell anemia.
Well, you reap what you sow.
His mother was a seamstress but he preferred to reap than to sew.
He hasn't changed a bit!
Sure hope they have a big crowd for the service - the funeral director says that business has completely stopped since this fellow passed on.
Isn't this rather redundant?
This is Death warmed over.
I told him not to touch himself.
I guess we should be happy he is gone.
I guess with the way the world is now, he couldn't keep up with the demand for his services.
I guess they'll cremate him once he gets to hell.
He drank himself to himself.
Shoot! Who's going to be coming for us now?
He got too into his job.
Yes, it's you. I don't feel the temperature dropping.
I wonder who delivered the news.
Him and his souvenirs.
I only met him a couple times but he left an impression.
I see Prez Twitter hired a new hatchet man.
sometimes it's tough to bury the hatchet
Stupid cartoon. There won't be a winner.
He looks almost alive, doesn’t he?
Well, I suppose his mother loved him.
Locally sourced it looks like, and highly perishable.
Is this a celebrity endorsement?
That was an incredibly awkward threesome.
I told him, "take it easy, you're going to kill you're going to kill yourself if you're not careful."
Things just won’t be the same without him.
You kiss him first.
If you ask me, he looks a little too damn proud.
I told him that scythe would be the death of him. But did he listen? No. No ears on that one.
As you sow, so shall you reap
Global warming got him too
He looks just like himself.
He fell on his scythe.
I never thought he'd go before me.
If you ask me, he's only playing himself.
He gets more sleep now that people are living into their nineties.
He better not be playing dead again.
So this is the meaning of bury the hatchet
Honey, didn't they do such a nice job at capturing his "grimness"?
Would it be fair to say he went down swing?
Huh. I guess you can take it with you.
Martha, now I'm stuck with you forever .........
He was waiting for Godot.
It must have been a stroke of luck.
His sense of humor just kills me.
So, I'm stuck with you for eternity?
You know, he wasn't a bad dad, for someone who was on the road all the time and never let you see his face.
Wow, the mortician took fifteen centuries off him.
So this is day one of his empathy training program.
And they say only the good die young.
He looks real life-like, doesn't he honey?
I'm sorry for our gain.
Really? It was in Bill's will that he be dressed like this for the viewing?
This is the nail in the coffin, Stanley. We’re getting cremated.
“I think he knew life would go on without him.l
The tragedy is I sold my retirement community stock.
He looks so life-like.
I was still hoping that he could help out with Doreen.
He looks good for eternal.
First taxes, now him.
He just kept going on those cruises to nowhere and wouldn't stop eating all those raw clams.
Who'd have thought carrying a gun for self protection would actually work?
This is GRIM! They'll all say Alfred reaped what he sowed.
So, does this mean that we are now immortal?
I heard the flu wore him out.
Well, you reap what you sow.
No--you try scythe, then you try magic.
He looked good for his age.
It’s a shame, he had such a pleasant disposition about life.
I told you not to take him trick or treating at the Kervorkians.
He had a good run.
We really should cremate the SOB.
And I'm not paying my taxes, either.
He laid himself off?
The good news is we can start smoking again. The bad news is we're trapped.
I guess I'm not next.
I always told you that in the end you will reap what you sow.
So Morris was the Grim Reaper all along?
Goes to show you, if you don't have your health...
Is it sew or sow?
I don’t know hon, do we say REAP instead of RIP?
Kind of ironic wouldn't you say?
Pipe tobacco kills too. I never would have thought it.
And I told him one of us would have to have to go.
I did tell him not to take a selfie.
Could taxes be next?
He always insisted on working the night shift.
Calorie restriction, low carb, good fats--looks like this didn't work either.
It's a shame too, that was a new scythe
He finally got his comeuppance.
I never thought he'd be the first one of us to go.
Remember when art exhibits were just nice paintings? I don't understand this modern stuff.
So you do, you reep what you sow ..
I told you the “Fold up Reaper” was the right choice for Uncle Cyrus
Did he die of sickle cell? I thought it was verbal flatulence...
I told him to be careful with the sowing.
I told you Helen would put him to the test.
Well there goes our retirement.
Pride got him in the end.
Sure it was two against one, but I still didn't think we'd win.
It's payback time.
He always though he'd beat dying by wearing this outfit.
He finally learned his lesson.
now what are we supposed to do?
Does this mean we’re going to outlive our Social Security?
As a friend he was so humble, I had no idea he spent his death collecting souls.
Undertakers may experience a business downturn.
I guess the schoolwork finally did him in.
The mortician's service is tomorrow.
They say it was an industrial accident.
I guess we don't have to renew our vows.
Now I understand why he buried Mother in that angel costume.
He could have done so much more with his death.
It's some dorky guy with a quizzical look on his face - that's not art!
He still looks pretty grim.
well, his life won't change.
That backswing of his did him in...
Tax reform, to be sure!
I guess he was right. It does come to all of us.
He really worked himself to death.
I told you Charlie wouldn't give up without a fight.
He was such a nice Republican.
That must have been one heck of a holiday.
Can we get a refund on our prepaid funeral plans?
He was self-taught.
It's gotta feel like a busman's holiday for him
He requested "pranking St. Peter at the gate" as his final wish.
Well, I guess it really does take one to know one.
I told him it was a job with no future.
His last wish was for me to file his tax returns.
Unlike irony.
Harold, I think it's a trap.
Scythe no more.
So I wonder who came for him?
A bit morbid if you ask me.
I tried to warn him. Nobody puts Baby in the corner!
Nice try, Eddie
He was a lousy chess player.
Such a shame, he was only a few years away from retirement.
I guess I can cheat death after all.
How odd. In eternal repose, he doesn't look at all grim.
Gee, I just wanted him to eat the cake that I made last week.
And I thought he would live forever.
The irony of death
Well, I guess this means we're now stuck here.
What a shame, he just paid his taxes!
...and we were so close
He died doing what he loved best. Being dead.
I call dibs on the scythe.
I heard it happened on the way back from paying his taxes.
He fell for the old rubber/glue trick.
He hath sowed and now hath he reaped.
who reaped the reaper
What's good for the goose.......
He slipped.
I really thought he would outlast us.
I met him last month when you were in the hospital and almost died.
Welp, good luck finding an apartment now.
I guess it's true--as ye sow, so shall ye reap.
At least he went out on his own terms.
I guess you never really never know somone.......
I hear Johnson in Marketing got the promotion.
Enough already with the hoodie.
He said it would be a scythe of relief...
In his line of work the coffin is deductible, so there is a little irony."
He always took the job too personally.
This doesn’t bode well...or bodes really well.
It's just as the pastor said! "Oh Death, where is thy sting?"
Heck, now we’re immortal.
The I.R.S. killed him.
He used to test the beds at the Sleep Number store; this suits him perfectly.
His brother always hated him.
You can't even tell he had an accident.
He wanted a closed coffin but....
Looks like he went down fighting.
I didn't mind she went Goth but she knew our garden tools were strictly off limits.
Do you think we can get out of the contract for that condo in Boca?
OMG! Does this mean "till death do we part" is now null and void? But I had plans!
He was so quiet and unassuming.
If you think he looks natural, you should have seen him last week.
I wish we had been 18 when this happened.
Is he gone or just taking a nap?
This feels like a trap.
It just doesn’t look like him.
Thanatophobia, resolved.
Oh my, ... it's just like that old movie, "Death Takes A Holiday"!
First it was driverless cars and now this!
They say the new guy is more lenient...
I guess it was inevitable.
I told him these cos play conventions would be the death of him.
This year's production of 'A Christmas Carol' just won't be the same without Harry.
I'll be damned...the Grim Reaper's been scammed!
I thought he was only cutting red tape.
I think his work just finally caught up to him.
Nice job by the undertaker -- he doesn't look grim at all.
I understand it was a soul cause of death.
No, it wasn't a heart attack...it was karma.
I hope his replacement won’t be as grim.
They say that they die the same way they lived.
Reaping is its own reward.
I'm sorry he's gone, but doesn't this mean that we'll live forever?
Just wait until you see the other guy.
Is it a he or she?
I’d of thought he preferred cremation.
He always said scouting for the Mets would be the death of him.
Wow, another casualty of Amazon.
Well, Martha, the pressure’s off.
Death becomes him. He doesn’t look so grim.
Turns out stopping for me was a bad idea.
Oh, so this is hell
The eulogy should be a real thriller.
So young, what a shame. I hear it runs in his family.
They said he was just really bored
I told him not to run in the house with that scythe.
May he REAP in peace.
I heard it was suicide.
Do you think this might mean I'll have to go back to work?
Very grim! Shows you reap what you sow.
Does this mean we’re now immoral?
So much for fringe benefits.
I never saw him as the type to commit suicide.
I told him, 'You don't look so good, don't take a holiday now,' but did he listen?
I tried to tell him he couldn't outlive Larry King.
Done.
Gosh darn morticians and their childish pranks.
We need to update our resumes.
He finally got to put that Halloween costume to good use.
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
He was always full of surprises.
Remarkable! He looks almost as grim as he did in death.
This casket's a bit higher priced, but you have to admit it's one hell of a package deal.
Uncle Morris?
First time at a British wake?
They say he was worked to death.
Now, thanks to Trump, that's both of 'em.
Well, he never paid his taxes, so I guess not everything is certain.
we should have splurged for the extra long casket
Grandma insisted on being buried in her Halloween costume.
I would have preferred a suit. Death be not shroud.
He is resting before the q & a at the Bergman retrospective at the Film Forum.
He still owes us last month's rent.
I honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry.
We're stuck with each other forever.
No, I don't believe he was signed up as an organ donor...
He laughed about paying his taxes too.
I guess it's true that no one lasts forever.
Now who will is part?
I wonder how he likes it on the other scythe.
Well, it looks as if we are stuck with each other for the duration. And all that money we spent on estate planning is down the drain.
I bet he's faking it.
How are we going to get out of here now?
Well finally, the Grim Reaper got the Grim Reaper.
What will we do now? We don't have enough money left to live forever.
This ouughta put to rest any beliefs in an afterlife!
Kinda ironic, isn't it?
He’s never looked so good.
I want to believe he's been reunited with Bergman.
He really IS late.
Commendable devotion to the cause indeed.
I GUESS THIS MEANS WE LIVE FOREVER! OH MY GOD!
Ya reap what ya sow.
He never looked so dead.
Looks like we dodged another scythe.
He loved that uniform.
Oh no, it means we are now immortal!
I'm pretty sure he's sitting in your spot, Harold.
Red meat...who knew?
He looks good, don't you think? They did a fine job...fine job.
He looks like he did when he was dead.
It's rather sad. He never had a lasting relationship.
I only said, "Isn't this Coffin to die for?"
Those new x-ray machines at the airports really were the beginning of the end for him.
Even he couldn't escape himself.
I might start doing drugs
I warned him that rusty scythe would be the death of him.
'How very meta'
Reaper is sleeping late this morning; he had a busy night.
Okay Charles, time to get up and go to work!
He was always such a downer, I'm really not sorry to see him go.
One scythe fits all.
Remind me to call and cancel that cardiologist appointment when we get home.
Old man Reaper finally caught up to himself!
Whoever Thought Father Time Would Go?
In this case, I’m not sure that “life-like” would be considered a compliment.”
He was so overworked.
Lenore said he was ready to go.
I just asked him to trim the hedge a little.
They got his makeup all wrong.
Honey, are you going to apply?
When he came for the archbishop, he found the old man well prepared.
Sure, he looks good; he just got back from Miami Beach
Nice work, but this is going to hurt business....
He left me 100 billion souls in his will.
I'm glad. He was worse than a plague.
We all knew that suicide would take him.
They say it was high cholesterol.
Soooo, does this mean we have to live forever?!?
Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
I told him not to pick his nose. It was just a matter of time...
What kind of schmuck would dress like that for a funeral?
We reap what we sow...
To be, or, not to be, I guess that was the question!
It only took a shellfish allergy. Who knew?
They say he died as he lived.
He always was a workaholic...
we knew his days were numbered when he joined the cabinet!
How many times have I told him, one scythe does not fit all?
I understand that his son has now taken over the business.
I'll bet he got a huge employee discount!
That dull old scythe was no match for such a sharp tongue.
He was always such a disappointment.
So this is a meta death.
I told him to stay off the pale horse.
Does this mean we have to close the funeral home?
He couldn't get over the Lazarus thing...
He took the early retirement package.
Don't worry, Sidney will help us download the Grim Reaper App.
It's nice to see him taking a holiday for once.
Well, no one can say he was cheated.
I guess he just couldn’t compete with the App.
He could have done so much great for our world.
He was always the one who dressed perfectly for every occasion.
I certainly hopes we can still count on taxes.
Rest in peace, irony!
Well, I guess this means we'll all live forever now. The Social Security Administration isn't going to like this AT ALL!
They did a good job on the poor fella, but I never thought that someone of his stature could be overtaken by an undertaker.
I told you not to be so proud!
He always took DIY too seriously.
So this is what the end of death looks like.
May he REAP in peace.
He always looks so cute when he's asleep.
He should not have attempted to take the scythe of the Unmaker.
So, I guess this means we live forever.
I forgot to tip the mortician.
I always said he'd come to no good.
As he so happily sowed, he grimly reaped.
We can try to deny it, but it comes to us all. Even him!
No more out with the old I guess.
Death finally caught himself
Are we burying semiotics or symbolics?
Well, it was either him or us.
And the insurance won't pay, if they can prove it was self-inflicted.
One too many funerals
He really threw himself into his work.
I guess we shouldn't have blown all our retirement money on cruises after all.
Oh dear, cancel the reverse mortgage.
I think we should stay for the eulogy.
It could be worse at least he doesn't have to pay taxes now.
It’s grim alright.
The greatest victory of karma
You look great in it but your drunk shopping has become a problem.
How come we are visiting the grim reaper?
I told him the bio-tech industry would be the death of him.
I 'm confused. Why are we here?
He wanted a closed casket because he was tired of alwways looking death in the face.
Obviously, he's new at this.
I guess you reap what you sow. Even if what you sow is that you reaped.
I know you thought he was one of the immortals. But people change.
RATS! I told you not to cancel our longterm-care coverage!
He’s trying it out for his next victim.
They first thought he had Sickle Cell Anemia.
Wouldn't you think they could find a way to tuck in in there?
Does this mean same thing can happen to the taxes?
He doesn't look so grim now, does he? Do you think he'll be needing that scythe?
You never know who you're going to miss until their gone.
Well this funeral just got Grim...
Well, what goes around comes around, I guess.
What goes around comes around, I suppose.
He's Taking A Sabbatical.
Who cut him down?
Really grim.
Hearse-say is he had a death wish.
Good luck in retirement. Us accountants got it from here.
He was never a good boy.
Timmy looks so natural!
Well, maybe he escaped taxes.
His fate was grim.
He was just too good.
Well if he's in there, who is going to part us?
Jackass, you messed with the wrong woman
Scythe and all? That'll be awkward.
Boca Raton was just too much for him.
Must have been too much starch.
I heard your mother came knocking.
Looks like Times Up won out over Right Wing Populism.
I thought he was an economist.
Okay, remind me to listen next time you nag about my own self-fulfilling prophecies.
Horse manure. I always knew he was full of it!
And we just bought him that new scythe for Día de Muertos.
He still looks so grim.
But his breath! My Gawd!
Even in death we don't get rid of the drama queen.
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
Is there anyone in there?
He died doing what he loved ... to himself.
He told me I was at death's door, so I shot him between the eyes...
They said the sickle is not included in “The Grim Sleeper” model.
Just great... with him gone we'll have to go to the kids for Christmas.
Fast-track the cremation.
Well, Ralph, we beat another one.
So smug! We told him to be not proud!
I bet she didn't see that coming.
For God's sake don't move
They just said he's in a better place...then, why so grim?
He finally succumbed to his own medicine.
I always expected to go before him.
Looks like we’ll be giving immortality a try.
He encountered a fatal error.
He loves death more than life
I've heard that the President will nominate himself for this position.
After all that sowing he got reaped
I'm rethinking the open casket.
That WAS her wedding gown.
So now what do we have to look forward to?
It was irony that did it.
Could this mean the end of death?
See? No need to fear the reaper
Charles always did have a flair for stating the obvious.
Took his own life, rather than bear witness to another Trump campaign
I guess we have a new lease on life.
Sick bastard to the end.
Office parties will never be the same.
Now we can finally rest in peace.
I guess the bell tolls for thee, too, Donny...
The end is past.
Who could have seen it coming?
I know the undertaker didn't like dad but to bury him in that woolen coat and gardening utensils is just plain wrong.
Irony. It's crueller than death itself.
Looks like he reaped the reaper!
I guess he didn’t make the cut!
It's amazing what they can do these days. He looks so less grim.
I guess you could call it 'Return of the Scythe.'
I saw him yesterday and he was looking a little pale.
I was either this or impeachment.
Reaper what you sow.
It was nice of him to join me at my last supper, but I was never that great with casseroles.
I'm glad our appointment was rescheduled for May.
Herbert always said he wasn't going to go without a fight.
It makes no sense. Why would he kill himself?
It was always something with him.
I'll always believe the bullet was meant for me.
Talk about dead weight!
He looks so dead.
Does this mean that we have to live together forever?
Well, he wasn't all that grim, was he/
I hope it was excruciating.
We’d better shut that lid before he wakes up.
Psychopomp Problems
A little 'on the nose,' don't you think?
He got such a tan in Palm Springs.
Oh shucks, I was hoping he'd take you first!
He rang his own bell.
It's bad to speak ill of the dead.
He spent too much time with that reaper.
If it were only true for eternity not just this election cycle!
Isn’t that sweet? He’s keeping it warm for you, honey.
I think this means we'll never die, and we'll be married forever.
So who will visit us when it's our time to go?
I guess we're stuck here with each other.
The funny thing is I've never seen him look so life-like.
Does this mean our marriage is over?
I think he's just resting.
The Angel of Irony strikes again.
Remind me not to eat the tuna casserole next time...
Even his days were numbered once he asked for whom the bell tolled.
I still don't understand why you volunteered to give the eulogy for this asshole.
Do you think Jared can handle the job?
I can't get over it. He looks so deathlike!
There you go, Frank. It's not so hard, is it?
They say he was never the same after his time at the White House.
OMG, Geoffrey........ he always said it was Max Factor.
Here's your proof, Janice, western medicine has just gone too far.
There'll be Hell to pay when this holiday is over
He says it "gets him in the zone"
Uncle Earl always said he'd go out in style.
I saw him chain smoking at the New Years Party.
As you sow, so shall you reap
NOW we can live forever.
Do you think he's really dead?
Looks like being Death finally caught up to him.
The look becomes him.
They say it was suicide
Do you think we'll be accused of cheating ?
Whoever did this to him is dead.
Do you think it was suicide?
Doesn't look like him at all.
Property rates are about to skyrocket
Suicide?
Good Grief, I Never Saw The Movie!
He looks so natural, pale and grim!
They say he was hit by a bus on the road to Damascus.
He's a dead ringer for you know who...
Last time I saw him he was hovering over your bed, Harold.
Don't be sad. He's like a bee returning to the hive.
Don't tell me my vote doesn't count!
Well, Everything has an expiration date!
Something tells me this isn't the retirement home, Arnold.
I guess we're now all gonna live forever.
Well, you know what they say about death and taxes...
So, who reaped the Grim Reaper?
He looks supernatural, don't you think?
It's all started when he read an article titled "Silicon Valley disrupting death with billion dollar venture."
People are saying Keith Richards was responsible.
I heard he was bothered by the competition from 23andMe.
Harry always said 'if you can't beat 'em join 'em'
he was well prepared for this moment
Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
I was playing racquetball with him just last week.
And now for the hard part: taxes.
What happens now?
No longer do we have to worry about him following us.
I told you prepaying for our funeral was going to be a waste of money.
What a cliche! Always the same trick.
No one gets out of here alive!
I would have expected a casket made from mahogany, not walnut.
I think they overdid it with the makeup.
Do you think we can cancel our burial insurance?
Now THAT must have been a tough day at work.
Do you think I can get my scythe back now?
You think he liked carrying that scythe around his whole life ?
Well I guess, it comes for all of us at some time.
I've never felt closer to death." "I have.
Death and taxes - even for the Grim Reaper!
It's our best selling Grim Reaper package.
I guess what comes around goes around really is true
I told him this would happen if he kept touching himself like that.
Well, it was time for death to be updated.
I had hoped he would appear more lifelike.
I thought this was your great-uncle's funeral, Harold!
He wasn't such a bad guy.
What a morbid sense of humor. Staring into the face of death...
I can finally try sky diving.
Looks like he lost his exemption.
Ya gotta admit—musta been a hell of a fight!
Grim looks more relaxed than I imagined.
Now what? He's always been there for us.
He looks good, don't you think?
I tried to tell him his work was self destructive
Is it my imagination, or have we been attending too many funerals?
I'd have called in sick that day.
He really loved his work. I just wish he had had more friends.
If we can just get rid of taxes now.
Gives new meaning to the eleventh hour.
Well, with his job you can't say you didn't expect it to happen.
They did a good job. He looks like he's just sleeping.
Looks like he reaped once too often. How grim!
Looks pretty grim to me, Hon.
First God dies, and now this! Where will it stop?
I knew something was wrong when he didn't show for our appointment
So, are we immortals now?
I'm glad he's finally gone. But does that mean we just go on like this forever?
It’s a bit cliche but...you reap what you sow!
I just have one thing to say: "more cowbell."
Lying there, he looks so lifelike.
One less worry, so let’s get married.
He couldn't adjust to texting.
The embalmer did some job. He looks so lifelike.
Say goodbye to your merry widow dream.
He had such infinite possibilities...
So sad. No one wants his apartment.
I thought we said, 'till wealth do us part'
It was just a matter of time.
That's one less for the holidays.
He always was sickely
I warned Robert he was in a dead-end job.
I never expected to see Steve Bannon rest in peace
Looks like the price of wheat will be going up.
Does this mean we're not going to die?
He's only napping.
It's what he wanted; overdressed and flamboyant to the end.
Not to empower the IRS Harold, but we should have taken them out first.
His job killed him.
It's worse. He wants to be buried on Neptune.
RIP Sloppy Steve
‘Looks like another hatchet job’
It’s the grand finale of his life’s work.
Up next, taxes!
The declining death rate was killing him.
Well, he finally broke the cycle... or whatever you call that thing.
We lost him long ago when he bought that scythe.
Death certainly led an interesting life.
Don’t celebrate. He’s only napping.
He died trying
That John Donne was right.
And just when we became Medicare eligible
Definitely the first time I submitted an obit with a smily face.
Funny, he looks so alive right now.
I guess that does away with our vow to stay together "until death" parts us.
Sweet justice, I say.
I wish Peter Thiel would've thought this one through.
I'm glad that look is finally going out.
He lived such a good life.
They told me at Emma Willard I shouldn't bother to learn chess.
Now irony is dead.
Well, just have to look at it this way; his time was up.
The news didn't go over well when I finished his taxes and told him he didn't get a refund.
I think he is just sleeping.
It seems everybody's in the cloud these days!
He thought he could get away with murder, but it bit him in the ass.
The world is grimmer than we thought!
His humor was always lost on me Cyril
He got his wish to wear that costume forever.
The Good Lord said, ‘He reapeth what he hath sowed.’
A little ironic but like I always say, "you reaper what you sow".
He lived a good death.
Does this mean that our Social Security payments will keep going?
And I was certain that I would go before he did!
Poor Death...I told him his job was killing him!
He wanted to face Death on his own terms.
Now there's a guy who doesn't feel the same kind of pressure we do.
("That's just great...now we'll be together forever...")
He does a good job playing dead.
He challenged me to a game to win back my soul. I chose Russian Roulette
So I sez to Mabel, "You reap what you reap."
Hoist with his own petard
Death and Taxes! Nobody's exempt!
he's hoping for life after death
I wasn’t expecting this kind of rendezvous.
He just couldn't keep up with the latest agricultural technology.
He just seemed hopeless after Prozac went on the market.
Maybe this is just his twisted sense of humor.
I suppose he reapt what he reaped.
He's off to a better place.
He was so full of life.
He looks rather grim.
your scythe doesnt even fit in the casket you goddamned imbecile
He likes going on vacation during tax season.
He looks sow reapful
I had no idea he was so sickle.
So lifelike.
You're right. He doesn't look very proud.
Do you think a judge would grant us an annulment?
I never imagined he would go before us.
It reminds me, you haven't had a new suit in a long, long time.
He put up a good fight.
Nap time is over, smart guy. Get back to work!
In an odd way, I'm going to miss him...
He should've carried a bigger scythe.
Is it be a stretch to say he looks "natural" and "peaceful"?
There was so much more I wanted to say.
Welcome to the happily forever after, Fred.
She hasn't looked this good in years.
Well, that explains my weird dream last night.
Best undercover agent we've ever had.
He looks so alive.
... for he's a jolly good fellow...
He was a good boy even if he never paid me a visit
I've always assumed that life as we know it would die first.
There must be a catch here somewhere...
When I asked where do you see yourself in 5 years, I don't think he expected this...
She always dressed for the occasion.
Great, so no one dies anymore and dammit, I just mailed in my life insurance check.
Well, I guess our only option now is divorce.
He was such a good actor.
Seven years at Harvard and he reverts to a 7th grade costume.
I can't beleive he outdied us.
So, did you bring his check ?
You're right, it look quit comfortable but could you show us something less expensive?
I don't care who you outlived - you're still getting your prostate checked.
Didn't I tell him he'd poke himself in the eye one day with that thing?
Well, death was my only hope. What do I do now?
Are you sure that isn't him, Mrs Houdini?
Who's going to look over us now?
Do we have enough savings to live for all eternity?
I don't care who you are, abuse power, Times Up.
Martha's devastated. She never knew he was allergic to peanuts!
See you in Hell!
Qf7#...he didn’t see it coming.
Maybe he won't bother us anymore.
Like death cooled over.
Uncle Elmer always took cosplay a bit too far.
I told him, he had to take better care of himself
I hear his wife is relieved.
I don’t think he’s quite dead yet. Maybe we should burn him.
It's a shame he died on Halloween.
I guess that death ended its holiday.
He decided to take a Busman's Holiday.
Goodbye Death. I liked you before I met you.
I never realized he lost that chess match in the Ingmar Bergman movie.
He hadn't been looking well...
Egads! Is that you Herman?
You should apply for his job!
He doesn't look so good this time.
He won't need it where he's going.
You think he can hear us?
I was sure he worked for the CIA.
He must have committed suicide.
We must be really old
Sad. He had the D.C. region. Everyone's selling theirs direct- totally cutting out the middle man.
The poor widow gets no pension because he was self employed
I didn't realize the Grim Reaper was such a narcissist.
I begged him not to go to Samarra, but does he listen?
They did such a beautiful job on him." "I know! He looks so natural!
It's not every day you get to say good-bye to a Scythe Spirit.
How are they going to close the casket?
Hurumph. How 'bout that: Beat at his own game.
If I told him once I told him 1000 times 'As you sow, so shall you reap', but did he listen?
They say he died of loneliness
Apparently the sting was inside him the whole time.
Shot himself in the foot.
Oh that Bob. Always such a card.
He knew his time was coming.
He looked so much better at the spring gala.
He looks so much better than the last time we saw him.
The funeral director did a horrible job on the Grim Reaper’s face; you can hardly see it.
It is very grim, the death of Mr. Reaper.
I'll bet he didn't see that coming. (emphasis on that)
They say it was a result of sibling rivalry.
Comic-con was brutal this year.
A funeral is already pretty grim...
Shame. He had such a joie de vivre.
that service was pretty Grim
I guess he saw it coming.
And to think, he was so young.
Remember what that lawyer said? "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit!"
I hear he never paid taxes, though.
I knew asking him to join us for the dinner you cooked would get me out of it.
Did you say grim or grin?
The population time bomb is about to get a whole lot worse.
I would feel better if the casket fit.
He kept talking about Kurzweil like it really bothered him.
Death came to be him.
It appears that he ran out of time
He always said his work would be the death of him.
Perhaps he’s going to a better place
That was his favorite Halloween costume.
It’s the latest thing in empathy training.
Well Edna, I guess the only thing that's certain now is taxes.
Our President just tweeted that it's all just fake news or Obama's fault; either way, he's taking credit for it.
What's the chance we can sell those plots back to Forest Lawn?
They said it was a massive heart attack when he got told he had to take Trump...
I heard he didn't even have life insurance...
Our worries are over.
I guess this means we have to live forever.
We are distantly related but never met.
Well is is a little redundant
Yes, we may live forever, but who is going to do us apart now, Harold?
Do you think he ever took that long awaited holiday?
The Grim RIPer
Geeze, who knew Vince moonlighted as the Grim Reaper?
No death do we part? Does this mean I have to stay married to you for eternity?
I feel very close to you right now.
Those killer apps take their toll.
There goes “till death do us apart” from marriage vows.
So that's why he was always on the road.
I hear it was misdiagnosed as sickle-cell disease.
One down, one to go.
Sad, he worked himself to death
So, I suppose this has got to be the end of things. And we were preparing for the zombie apocalypse.
When he grabbed me in a dark alley and said "it's your time" I sprayed him with mace. I didn't expect it to work this well.
Blue Oyster Cult was right...no need to fear the reaper
Don't worry, he's just doing market research.
Who would have thought...?
I heard he was taking a holiday, but why on our cruise ship?
They captured the grim perfectly. The reaping seems problematic.
Grab the scythe and run. He’s gonna be fuming when the mickey wears off.
So I says “Who wants to live forever?” and then he does this!
He did say something about a busman's holiday.
He is finally reaping the benefit he deserved
He was told not to be proud
He should have upgraded from the scythe.
I guess I don't have to be afraid to open the door anymore.
He was 685 but didn't look a day over 520!
It was nice of him to finish the back 40 before he left.
even the undertakers are pushing fake news Henry.....
Whoa. Meta.
His last words were - I've blown an open gasket.
Dead my ass! He’ll come back to get us, just like Carl an Gladys. You watch.
His wife always said he looked grim!
The funeral home just hired him. He's the temper-reapic casket specialist.
He is faking it!
Grim Jr. finally came for his dad
Dead wrong.
The ad never said it included the body!
He put up a hell of a fight.
Bob felt like death wherever he would go.
I don't know why, but I guess I always just kind of assumed Death was immortal.
Do you think we can get the money back on that burial policy?
Fred never looked so grim !
With him gone, what happens to us?
I guess you can take it with you.
Sign out front says drop-ins welcome.
Cynthia, you've officially taken this 'playing dead' thing too far.
Well, nothing last for ever - not event the funeral business
I knew he was sick...
These cosplay funerals are getting out of hand.
See? Just like Ben said. There's the death part. Now, I wonder if he paid taxes?
He never learned to pronounced it, either.
I heard that, in his day, he was a real swinger.
I charge him fifty bucks a night. You can't say we don't need the extra money.
It's taken me awhile, but I think I'm finally beginning to understand the concept of "meta."
I'm fairly certain he also paid taxes
Well Mr Jones, at the very least i thought he’d be able to keep up with us.
He came for Jeff Sessions.
I guess this means that now we'll really have to wait forever.
You were right, Harold, he died of scythe-cell amnesia.
I told you Harry was the Greatest Dealmaker Ever!
I wonder how that happened?
I think he is from quality assurance
It was death by selfie.
He said he was over the harvest season for good
Is he being cremated? Or should we break his bones first.
He was killed by a sickle cell and has been re-scythled.
I always said, "you'd have to be high to want to hitchhike."
Synecdoche/metonymy reflexive and visual! Fantastic. But will anyone notice?
His relationship with Joan was not the best at the end.
Well, I guess it's a Donne deal.
He’s taking Stanislavki in a whole new direction
Now he's Donne it.
"Serve's him right for always scaring people".
After you, my dear.
Death finally got taken by taxes...
It's not as grim as I thought It'd be!
Well, at least the harvest is finished.
Death takes a holiday.
That doesn't look like Fred.
That’ll teach him to mess with Edith Morton.
Promise me you’ll use a better mortician.
Why couldn’t that have been me? Taxes are due next week!
They say this is the complete experience package
He always did have a good sense of humor.
He spent his whole life trying to dig himself out of a mess!
And I thought “As you sew, so shall you reap.” was just a figure of speech.
He was once a World Leader. Now all he has is the last pussy he grabbed.
Those who live by the scythe will die by the scythe.
This is the last person I thought would commit suicide.
Looks like your death wish is on hold.
Sorry Charlie; better you than me.
"I found the scythe but his hourglass ran out on him.
They say it was fatigue.
A suit would have been nice.
I hear Keith Richards is doing well.
He said something about the client experience ... and then hopped in!
This explains the skeletons in his closet.
All these years and I never even suspected.
He who lives by the sword perishes by the sword
I guess I will take death lying down
Wyd fathead
Does he always sleep like that?
Long story short, that's why he avoided mirrors.
Oh well, what goes around comes around.
Well Marge, looks like we're still stuck paying off our mortgage.
The mortician did a good job on the embalming. He looks so death-like.
I guess we really are old
Who says you can't take it with you!
Somehow he looks different.
Looks like he finally met his match.
He died doing what he loved. Killing himself.
I thought he seemed confused when he came to the door.
I guess we're safe now.
Does this mean we can live forever?
If you'd lived a little longer I could've been a rich widow.....
Betty White really figured it out, didn't she?
Now that, is dedication.
Hand me the mirror.
His last words were, "Who can compete with the NRA?"
Death always comes when you least expect it!
they did a marvelous job. He looks almost lifelike...
I THOUGHT he went to Yale.
Never thought we'd out live him
So this is what death warmed over looks like.
He said Herman was his ticket back across the river.
I guess death really does come to us all.
If he had only had a gun...
It's like a New Yorker cartoon come to life…I mean death.
The scythe is retractable.
Sadly, no one will miss him!
This is really meta.
Yes...he always seemed a bit artificial to me too.
All those years, did he ever bother to visit? Not even a phone call.
Suicide is painless
That's our scythe.
Who knew it had been sick.
What do you think he meant that he felt redundant ?
Get those tickets to the Bahamas!
Wow! Father Time decided to go now rather than go through President Trump's term of office.
I hate to say he got what he deserved, but ...
Gross--he looks so lifelike.
So much for the ZPG movement.
Oh crap. Does this mean we will live forever?
Is it wrong that I’m kind of relieved? Am I a bad person?
He had it coming. And, again...with the black.
He didn't pay his taxes.
There must be a new guy on the job.
Well... looks like he messed with the wrong mamajammas.
He always said nobody's perfect.
He always was a show-off.
I always thought he was too mean to die.
I told him that the General Tsao's chicken was extra spicy...
I thought death was on a holiday.
Seeing the Reaper in repose added an uplifting feeling to an otherwise solemn occasion.
He was always so depressing to be around, I think this is a blessing.
The pranks. The incessant pranks. I'm surprised someone didn't act years ago.
I heard the job finally killed him.
All's well that ends well.
They day it was a work accident “.”” “They say it was a work accident.
No, he was an avid mower.
Hello. Hope you are well. I'm just resting. You better leave.
There’s no end to this!
So, remember 'Till death do us part'?
And without even a sneaking suspicion.
It's a busman's holiday.
Death has met its match.
I guess he finally retired.
In the last 40 years, he worked himself to death.
It was time.
He thought it would be his turn forever.
When I knew him he was just cranky.
He is beyond grim.
Ironic that he loved his trade so much he was willing to die for it.
If something happens to Donald Trump, we'll be out of joke material!
Is this what we meant when we said 'til death do we part?
Couldn't he have used a mower to cut the grass?
I suppose he just has to take a break once in a while
He committed suicide.
That's Joe for you. Always the joker.
He always did look good in that hoodie.
I didn't think he ate the salmon mousse.
What is next to go: taxes?
We put him in his dress scythe and cloak, which he rarely used.
It's like the death of death itself, George. Oh, here we go again, Sartre, that meshuggah Heidegger, stop already !
Here in Russia, we don't just use the flag anymore.
Whodunnit?
Based on our retirement account, we have about 10 years to find a job.
Gone before our time.
Looks like too much bad karma
I guess death happens to the best of them.
I was so looking forward to getting to know him better.
yo dog,
Jeepers, creepers, we've become grim peepers.
He zigged when he should have zagged.
Is it time to look for a career change from tax accounting?
Yes, this was his favorite scythe...
Poor guy! Our latest pristine medical report just overwhelmed him.
1. I'm still not convinced. 2. That took forever. 3. He can't fool me. 4. I'm glad to see this Assisted Living neighbor move on.
He is so much better looking in person.
Now can we take a vacation?
Does this mean I have to stay alive?
I warned him that "as ye sow, so shall ye reap!"
So now we live forever?
Wow, the Grim Reaper's performance art has gotten pretty meta.
It was a brutal ending but I had to do something about your escalating life insurance costs.
He died doing what he loved. Death.
You just expect her to get up any minute.
I didn't think he took it so seriously.
He always was an open casket kind of guy...
Told you those chess classes would be worth it.
What happened?” “Suicide.
He was always such an unpleasant fellow.
Well, I guess you just reap what you sow.
This is the proof of our eternal life.
Well, I guess that's the end of that
OH, my goodness! Whose going to take his place?
They say that he was a workaholic.
Well Dear...It's about Time!
He should have see it coming.
I guess the old adage is wrong - he probably does wish he could spend one more day in the office.
Embalmer did great. He looks just like Death!
I still think it should have been closed casket.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
And flights of devils sing thee to thy rest!
Who's going to help us keep the grass trimmed if he takes his scythe with him?
He said he didn't feel up to snuff...so I cooked up a little chicken soup...
He had a good death
Well, he looks damned proud to me!
You're right, death does become her.
We just heard from the White House. You’re fired.
I guess this is part of vegan burial ritual
After all that soul-searching, he must have finally embraced himself in the end.
Well now what, Harry?
I told him not to look in the mirror.
He said that two world wars and two atomic bombs were achievements enough for him.
This is like that time on Star Trek Voyager when Janeway got caught up in that time loop....
I guess the Tax Reform was truly too much.
I asked him to warm it up for me.
Funny, it looks like he's sleeping.
I like the way the mortician made his scary, lipless, grinning skull into a sexy, pouty, happy face.
Damn good chess player
You realize, of course, now we're equally damned.
I always thought he was a grim fellow.
One tap on the shoulder, and BOOM.
He looks even better than when he was alive.
Yeah, he had a great sense of humor and loved his children but now I'm stuck with you forever.
Ashes to ashes, dust to rust.
He did some good work...but after the Carrie Fisher thing, nobody could forgive him.
Does this mean the rent in our nursing home is going to go up?
He never had an unkind word to say about anyone...
Let the dead bury the dead
He always made such good macaroni salad.
And I thought Mega Death was a rock group
He looks better than he did in death.
The repetition depressed him.
Well maybe we should look into that divorce lawyer.
We made it -- the Fountain of Youth.
There goes my last and only hope of outliving you.
Such a drama queen!
Well, it was bound to happen.
Does this mean that Hell is freezing over?
He should have known better.
That's so meta.
He dressed for the job he wanted.
How's the casket supposed to close with the scythe sticking out like that?
Excuse me, do you know where the bathroom is?
Role model!
the reaper must also be reaped.
He’s only fooling himself.
When they tried to cremate him, the whole crematorium burned down.
Poor guy, he choked on a human bone.
Does this mean we don’t have to pay our taxes
I guess he'll be hacking for the Russians now.!
He overdosed on epidemics
He was always so cheerful.
Why, just last week he looked only warmed over.
I told them, No farm implements.
Not so grim...
"Better get back the deposit for that cruise, it looks like your Aunt Sylvia will be around for awhile after all".
I warned him he'd be done for if he took my precious kitty Mister Lickers.
So what does this mean to our Long Term Care costs?
"Well, I guess John Donne was right after all.'
I wonder what will happen to his Twitter account.
I guess this means who won't be appearing in anymore cartoons.
looks like he got what was coming.
I deeply hate the way times are changing
He was apparently very sickle.
Why did the doctor have to wait for X-rays?
Surprise! Surprise!
I told him to see a doctor for that cough.
Weird, but it makes sense -- he pretty much mocked everyone.
I'm a little surprised he wasn't cremated.....
We get it. The death of death. Now come outta there preacher and finish your Easter homily.
It's still hard watching our friends go before us.
So you weren't lying? You really dodged a bullet.
It's about time!
Well... So much for Plan B...
This takes standby travel to a whole new level.
The angels are starting spring training.
Is he trying to be ironic?
It was a ricochet.
At least he'll know people on the other side.
Bless his heart. He never couldn't part with his security scythe.
I hope this doesn't make us immortal.
He looks grimmer than usual.
Couldn't they find a smaller scythed coffin?
I was never proud of him as a son
good old George always trying to dig his way out of a jam
I hear he still owed taxes.
I guess we won't be having many more of these.
He never wore a coat and tie.
He had looked frail and bony toward the end.
Well, you can’t say he didn’t believe in equal opportunity.
He looks disturbingly lifelike.
I heard this winter's flu was terrible but I wouldn't have dreamed it was this bad.
I honestly didn't believe that those kids in Silicone Valley could actually beat him.
Talk about your overkill...
He was one hell of a farmer.
Oh my God! Who's next?
I knew he was touching himself when he asked to use our bathroom....and locked the door.
Suddenly, I'm not so certain about my taxes anymore
There goes my job as a life insurance agent.
Death becomes her, doesn’t it?
Is it what you hoped it would be?
That reminds me hon, I need to pick up a head of lettuce.
I guess we should’ve maxed out the 401k.
His final moments, he was hit by a scythe, he began to writhe, and he started to tithe.
All that money for embalming and they still look grim.
Yeah, yeah, comfy. So we’ve seen the church and the funeral parlor. Now can you please get up and take us someplace that can help me avoid probate?
He always liked costumes
They did a wonderful job. He looks quite lifelike.
Who picked out that suit?!
He doesn't look like himself...
All that for a softer mattress.
Reap what you sow, I always told him.
It's nice that he makes the time to go home for the holidays.
It's not just his best suit, it's his only suit.
What people will do to avoid TSA screening.
Even he finally gave up on Trump!
As they say, "dead is dead."
It was inevitable.
Maybe we don't need health insurance any more.
When he was a little boy and his cat died, he said 'See ya later.'
I confess I feel a tingling in my loins.
A case of suicide.
The scythe does look a bit like a boomerang, but I would never have expected this to happen.
Halloween always was his favorite holiday
Seriously. He looks better than he did when he was dead.
His stalking days are over.
There really IS someone for everyone. I guess even the Grim Reaper finally met his match.
A scythe for sore eyes. As you sow, so shall you reap.
Oh dear, and we thought he'd get us first.
I told him not to scratch that itch on his shoulder.
Turnabout is fair play.
Golly Bob, we're getting Really old.
I think he's just taking a nap. Should I wake him up and tell him that my fish died this morning Harold.
Judging from his appearance he certainly doesn't look grim
Do you mind? We already purchased this casket.
I suppose this means we are never going to die.
He looks so um... um... dead.
Who would have thought his time was up?
Does this mean you're never going to die?
Doesn't look a day over 2,000,000
Do you think it's bad luck to peek under his hoodie?
Poor guy... cut down in his prime.
Considering how long he has been around, he doesn't look too bad at all.
Did the tax collector find him too?
Hop in. I no longer do House calls.
It's classic Karma.
He is faking it!
I told him not to wear that costume to the irony party.
He told me he was going to heaven when he died and was planning to find all the SOBs that screwed him and send them right to hell where they belong.
God is dead, death is dead, vive the Artificial Intelligence
Shouldn't he check his hand baggage? He'll never make it through security.
An utterly unpredictable suicide, indeed.
Wow. You think LA was over-crowded before. This is going to lead to a real population crisis.
It might be a good time to learn a little about zombies.
Pity he was too mean to buy a mower.
He looks very Grim!" "Yes he died very suddenly, apparently without any clues!
Grim, isn't it, Edward?
He put it off for years, but he finally made the mistake of trying to kill Chuck Norris
I wonder if he had to pay taxes too..
Harry always had a mean streak.
Hmmm, this ain't aunt Carol...
Oh, we where getting so close lately.
I told him that smoking would kill him . . . but he kept puff-puffing away as if he could escape himself.
For the life of me I do not recognize the deceased
The Grim Reaper tried to oppose Donald Trump!
I heard that he committed suicide caused by that dead end job.
Does our 401k have an eternity withholding amount?
O death, where is thy sting?
I don't remember him looking so cheery.
I can't say that I was surprised.
The Actuarial Tables will never be the same.
I think it's kind of a retirement party.
He'd been out a lot at night lately.
It just kills me to see him like this.
They say it was a peanut allergy
I told him he should stay in medical school.
Tsk. All work. No play.
I didn’t know one can die again
I opened the door and before he could do anything I gave him a tornado kick followed with a spinning hook kick and he just went down.
Gee, he looks so unnatural.
Burning Man is terrible this year.
I guess it’s true, you really do reap what you sow!
This is a grave error and he is RIPPED off
I am sad, but, John... I don't think that this is our Bob! Who should we speak to now?
Ugggh, again with the scythe?
Scythe no more, Hades, scythe no more.
Can't he wait till it is our turn?
Another Do it Yourself Kit from the kids
How deep are we in our policy?
I expected your Aunt Jane to go first.
Well, I see he has finally gotten a taste of his own medicine.
We should tell Morrie and Louise they won't be getting out tea spoon collection anytime soon
Only the good die young.
So he finally retired I see
I guess his final act was to join the cloud!
He looks much better after his holiday.
He was always so moody.
Death, where is your bling?
Well that put the kibosh on our future plans!
This “secret shopper “stuff has gone too far!
Everybody dies.
And we thought he just wanted to cut our lawn.
See? I told you he'd be late for his own funeral!
Poor thing. He looks like death.
Well, he sure as hell isn't proud.
This is very meta.
Do you think her daughter-in-law chose her burial dress?
They say you can't cheat death; wait till he sees our bill
I understand that he went long on nursing home stocks just before the end.
Poor thing, he always complained of having nothing to eat.
Your father and his pranks!
He impaled himself while sharpening a pencil. He should have just used a sharpener.
Pillow top or firm, that is the question?
Bottom of his class I recall, he never could understand Daylight Saving Time.
They did a good job-tactful robe, I'm not sure, though, about the accessories.
I don't know whether to cry or laugh.
He would return to the office every day in such a good mood! Who’d of thought he’d harvest his own soul?
The past came back to haunt him.
Who's going to take us away from here now?
We seem at singularity moment...
I'm telling you, it's a trap. Can you run faster than Gladys? Because I know you can't run faster than me.
I always hoped he would have a higher calling
He's much more trouble than our last border...
I hear he lost his health insurance.
At least we have a life-lease on the condo.
He was always at the club in Florida.
I say..."let the dead bury the dead", and let's get going to your brothers. We are late for dinner.
It is just a ploy, he came for us.
They say he outlived all his friends.
What do you think his chances of getting into heaven are?
Dead again?
We did tell him this dressing up would be the death of him!
Not today, Satan.
Harry intends to go mano a mano with the Grim Reaper.
You got a pin, Harold.
I knew it - I just saw him move.
The master of his own undoing to the very end.
What a story! One of the Brothers Grim.
You were right about 'the goth thing' being more than just a passing phase.
It comes for everyone, dear.
We're really gonna have to tighten our belts now. OR I wasn't expecting an open casket.
Lay off the chess just this once, I said.
I thought he requested to be buried with with his sand wedge.
Adding a 3-Wood was a nice touch too.
He wore his Sunday best everyday.
If I told him once, I told him a hundred times, 'Howie, dress nice for your funeral.' "
Well Mabel, at least he led a scary good life.
Gee, maybe this’ll turn out just like “Cocoon.”
I suppose it was just a matter of time.
He always said I was going to go first.
No, this is just where he like to take a nap.
Don't fall for it, there are Tootsie Roll wrappers all over the alley.
Wel, He always said he wasn't long for the job
Ha! I told him I would outlive him.
He may need that where he is going!
The Special Counsel Investigation was too much for him.
It was him or me. Grammy don't play that.
He looks so much better without the death-warmed-over look.
I didn't say renew our vows, Harold, I said we should review them.
Guess where he's going when this is over.
You got him Bernice, you guilted him into dying
I hear the funeral director killed himself.
That's absurd!
He once was the target on a celebrity roast. By the next year everybody was dead.
Don't you just hate it when someone is lying down on the job? He promised to pick me up 2 hours ago! How about you?
The last time I spoke with him, he said something about a busman's holiday.
Power nap.
It's amazing what you can do with iCloud and a 3D printer!
That is why every one is so terrible. They have nothing left to be afraid of. Death is dead.
I suppose no one is immune...
Poor Grimmy, he had so much more of death to look forward to.
Who will tell him?
Halloween was always his favorite holiday.
If you come after our family, we'll put you in the ground.
No, he's trying it out for you....
What do you think, Morton? Should we regret his passing?
Poor Harold. He thought the man coming was just cutting the wheat field!
We are the first generation of immortals.
He always was a very grim fellow.
No, I don't think a navy suit would have worked.
I think this is taking Cosplay just a little too far.
He never saw it coming.
Now, I’m definitely changing my withholding.
I wouldn't say grim, exactly.
Lying down on the job!
Personification finally caught up to him
Now that he's gone, we can count on a few more years.
He looks so dead inside
I told him that tofu was rotten, but he was soooo cavalier about it!
I will always remember Death just this way
And I thought barber college would be a good experience for him, Jerry, and then he could go to work for my brother.
All right, keep his name on all short term projects, but delete it from long term ones
What manual says about picking up aliens?
No one has really survived 2018.
Talk about a Goldilocks moment.
He was in law school when he started cross dressing.
I think he's just trying it out for scythe.
The lifeblood of our business, gone.
What goes around, comes around ... not a moment too soon
"He looks so Angelic".
Does this mean things will be less grim around here? Because we could really use that.
And...it comes with a lifetime guarantee.
Don’t get in the kitchen, if you can’t stand the heat
Next time you come after me, I’ll really give you the business.
"He looks as pale as his horse".
Nope. He doesn't have Global Re-entry.
We never should’ve put it on Airbnb.
A one-bed in Queens . . . cheaper than Downtown, I guess.
He sure did love Blue Oyster Cult.
I told you your brother-in-law’s funeral home was a bad investment idea.
Can you shut the top? It’s freezing.
We will NEVER escape Taxes!
Well, what do you know, the Grim Reaper just whacked himself.
He has your Mother's nose.
"Death comes to All of us." Sigh...
I want a divorce. I'm not spending eternity with you.
And tomorrow we're doing his taxes.
And his taxes?
Well, there's nothing in the regulations about NOT picking up hitchhikers.
Could you ask if they charged us for embalming and makeup?
His dying words were "I think I'd look great in that outfit."
He met himself in a parallel universe.
I guess this means we'll have an even l-o-n-g-e-r life together.
Ashes to Ashes...
Morty was a Bergman fan to the end but he couldn't play chess worth a damn.
That's pretty grim!
I told him I was armed and ready to use it!
No resurrection likely here !
Well, he went to Europe to find himself.
I can’t say I’m surprised.
I guess we will live forever now.
Aaaah, he's just playing possum.
I'd been telling him for years that he needed to cut back on red meat...
Well, I heard Halloween was her favorite holiday.
He was right, you know, when he said he never lived to see the day.
Saturday Night Live just won't be the same without him...!
See, I told you these were strange eons.
Looks like he finally reaped what he sowed
It's the wrong size for him, don't you think?
Who's going to cut the lawn now?
Somebody alert H.P. Lovecraft that he was right about the strange aeons.
I warned him not to go freelance.
He knocked on the vacuum cleaner salesman’s door ... swung and missed ... bit the dust instead.
I'd say it's ironic but c'mon, he was a walking skeleton!
Sad, but he had it coming to him.
Are we too early?
Scrooge's retort: 'I hope the shadow of Death and his sickle will be buried in a sealed casket inside a sealed vault!' No more ghosts to haunt me!!
He though he was going on a holiday.
"Because I could not stop for Death, he kindly went ahead without me...thank goodness.
When you don't care of yourself, you reap what you sow.
I wonder who will be running the escort service now?
I wish he hadn't taken up hockey at his age.
He had so much to live for
He said, just in case there's a dress code.
He choked on Arm and Sickle Baking Soda.
Sure doesn't look like him.
Next to you, Howard, I've never seen anyone so lazy!
Well, I guess that’s it! We’re here forever!
All it took was an itchy nose.
I heard he got the insider's discount.
Poisoned--garlic overdose, I heard.
Now there's an app for that.
So I guess death won’t be parting us...
Sigh...th
This must be one of those new themed funerals, Oliver. Remember how he was always humming, “these are a few of my favorite things.”
I told the cosmetologist quite distinctly: 'Grim Reaper', with an 'M'.
Remind me to speak with the embalmer.
Did he pay his taxes? ?
The farm wont be the same. He couldn't stack the hay and straw but sure could scythe it.
Live by the gun, die by the gun.
I have the sneaking suspicion that he is here to scare us to death.
They never do a good job with the make up
I've never seen a yarmulke quite like that one.
I warned him, it was gonna be either him or me.
I’m not ready for immortality at my age.
It was Mel with the hoe and Murray with the Sickle ... right?
I told you we should have gotten rid of that full length mirror in the hall.
It speaks to how far reaching the opioid epedemic really is
He said he's not going back to work until they get all the NRA money out of Washington.
I hope you remembered to warn the gravediggers, Walter. You know they'll charge a premium.
I guess what mows around comes to ground.
He's never looked so life like.
I told him to lay off the fried foods, but did he listen?
Nothing in his life became him like the taking of it.
Who's this? Never seen him before, as if I'd wanna!
That reminds me - our grass needs cutting again.
I hope this doesn't mean we're immortal.
I hear he paid taxes.
He was our best. it will be hard to fill his robe and scythe
And I thought he'd live forever.
Do you think I should finally get that nose job?
They say it was a bad case of diarrheaper.
Wow, I guess no one’s safe.
Well, at least we'll be immortal.
I would have thought that the baby-ringing-in-the-New-Year costume would have been more his style.
Resetting Daylight Saving Time proved fatal.
Coffin Mannequin:The Grim Reaper's Day Job
Looks like we're gonna' be here a while.
According to our vows we must divorce. We agreed Till death do us part
What a shame; he was so active!
I suppose, it was a higher calling.
I warned him the habit would kill him.
Who would've thought that he was vulnerable to a bad heart?
Get up, Grim. Your mother and I are going to dinner with the Crumps and you're in charge of your little sister.
Scythe was always a gentleman.
I told him to take the packable one, but noooo..he insisted on the regular.
I heard someone told him being 90 was the new 70 and so he decided to give up.
So that's what it means to outlive death.
He always said he wanted to be buried with the farm equipment. I've got the tractor outside.
She's finally reunited with your dear father.
mmmmmmm
You took ‘my love for nature’ a little too far, honey!!
Alas, his stress test, became his season finale!
He looks so natural there.
Actually, he looks more alive than ever
The world has lost a great talent.
It's a final resting place, so shoo; there's no rest for the wicked.
„You do realize that we‘re now out of our jobs, don‘t you?“
Will he need it where he's going?
They asked him to spell 'scythe' once too often.
Funny, he didn't look that sickle.
Death has finally caught up to himself.
The deluxe casket comes with an emotional support tool.
Maybe now he'll settle down and find his soul mate.
I said you were diggin' your own grave. So you've Reapped what you've sown and you can't take it with you!"
He looks much shorter in person.
I want to point and laugh but, perhaps a GoFundMe account would be more prudent.
Always the joker, that Marvin.
I thought he’d have a fancier casket.
Nice makeup job. Looks peaceful. Not so grim.
Nah...He's just resting...
Too bad, even now he doesn't fit in.
So how grim do you feel now!
hey Sally, I thought I told you to close the lid!
I told him moving knight to f3 was a mistake.
Laying flat on my back trough all of eternity? please promise you’ll bury me standing up.
This will have a deadly effect on cartoon art.
Paul never missed an opportunity to go meta.
I think he just killed the funeral industry.
Donne didi done!
We should have been kinder to him. I never thought he would do this to himself.
Is this the death or irony or is he ironically dead?
Does this mean we can finally go back to Kansas?
His tweets had been so morbid lately.
Does this mean we get to live forever?
If he wasn't mine, and he wasn't yours, then whose damn loved one was he?
He never could give up his day job.
We hadn’t planned on this...
Well, there are three horseman left out there. We might still have the Apocalypse.
The scythe is a good touch.
Well this is Grimm Brother, but You reap what you sow.
Oh my, we need to contact our broker. Our time horizon is not set to eternity.
After all those years of role playing, he couldn't be separated from his scythe!
It was bound to happen.
Amazing...he looks so unnatural.
So that's why they don't fear the reaper.
That was always his favorite at Halloween parties.
I see Death people.
Finally, we don’t have to worry about death.
Too bad it's Halloween -- we'll never know if this is real.
Gee, Death's gotten a little ostentatious these days
It's so heartwarming to see some realize his potential.
You live by the sword, you die by it...
I don't think I'll be able to find a new Mah Jong partner by Thursday.
I'd be more concerned if he was pointing downward.
Maybe this is what he meant by, "Til death do us part."
Just the other day we spoke about my daughter-in-law.
Pretty sure we weren't expected to outlive him. I'll call our retirement guy.
Well, they certainly did a great job at the mortuary. He's never looked so lifelike.
It is sad, but what goes around comes around.
He did not want to bury the hatchet with us!
He: "The Grim Reaper has adopted the subtle manners of Donald Trump." She: "Or vice-versa."
I heard he had a heart attack going through a haunted house.
Is this what they mean by "doubling down?"
Of course Death was Catholic.
You sir, suck
Don't worry, Harry. Just explain to the judge that it was self-defense!
Shame, I told him to use a 9 iron !
Why do I feel like we're in the wake of a trick?
Death be not proud!
So this is what the death of irony looks like.
So grim ! Repear to meet your maker
I'm thinking this ,"Senior Early Bird Buffet" may have been a ruse!
We should've sprung for some skin.
He loved life in all its different ways. He just couldn't take it all in.
This is for airline cartoon in March 5 issue: "Some people will do anything to avoid the extra fees."
Do you think he knows that the whole of humanity is laughing at–not with–him?
He's lost weight.
You put it together wrong.
He designed his own modular office.
And I was just thinking about him the other day.
I guess we'll be living longer. Have to recalculate our annuity.
If he’s gone our days are numbered!
He always seemed full of spontaneity and whimsey. How much more traditional can you get?
These times are even too much for death!
Talk about a busman’s holiday!
We should have sent him to Military School when we had the chance.
He was superfluous anyway.
And yet he looks so lifelike.
Sad. Just wore himself out working for billions of years.
I'm going to miss wishing he'd show up to those Seders.
Hate to admit, but I used Obamacare.
Our 401k will never last us.
I think I'm ready, but who will come for us now?
He had to pay his taxes too.
Do you think it was physician assisted?
He's bound to recognize many familiar faces
-Is this Death? -Ho no, not at all, it's the Circus Contemporary Art New Manifesto. Very alive right now.
Death took a holiday and came back with ebola.
I always said he looked like the grim reaper.
I can't believe we outlived our own son.
The irony of it... choking to death on your birthday cake!
I thought I was just making a funny turn of phrase when I said “Reaper, reap thyself.”
No good deed goes unpunished.
After all, he reaped as he reaped.
I bet he is sorry now he scythed down all the flowers
Even he couldn't afford the insurance cover.
I told you he'd be no match for old man Harold.
Right to the end...a scythe queen.
He must have gone to therepy.
Kinda debunks my theory that death squared equals life.
I swear it was self defense.
As Confucius said, the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.
I guess that the Grim Reaper needed a time out.
And I just did his taxes
He worked himself to death.
It's aspirational.
Now death has to stare us in the face.
That reminds me, it must be tax season.
He always said he would kill for that hoodie!
Martha, OMG!! That's your Uncle Bill. I thought he was away on business.
I wish they would bring back that t.v. show 'Monk'.
It was an open and shut case
Wow! That old hippy really is high!
He must have used all of his frequent flyer miles.
I wasted eight-thousand dollars on my funeral plan.
I understand that no family members have survived him...
Damn fool let his life insurance lapse.
AI scares me to death too.
I know how you feel dear, I recently lost my little Chihuahua.
He always did creep me out.
Does this mean we can get that time share now?
I heard he was estranged from his kids but this is ridiculous.
How the tables are turned!
I always had him pegged for a devil.
Maybe he's just napping, I'm ready to go.
He looks like death!
He doesn't look so grim to me. I detect a bit of a wry smile.
He just gave up the ghost when they wouldn't let him upgrade to the AR-15.
The good news is I can give you a discount on embalming services.
I noticed he’d died a few cartoons ago, but I had no idea it was for real.
I contributed $5.99 to the 'Go Fund Me' page.Next thing I knew we were invited.
As if we need a fuckin' placeholder!
Like Clint said Ralph, "We all got it com'in".
Does this mean we'll live forever?
The grim don't usually have a peaceful rest.
Does this mean we'll live forever?
With him gone, it's going to get really crowded around here.
Good thing he winnowed all the wheat before he passed!
Who thought Trump could do this ...to him!
Better double down on your pension
He was proud
He was always larger than life.
Uncle Jim always did put up a good fight.
What happened? That's not your brother!
There goes our retirement plans.
We all knew her condition was life-threatening...
Henry took resurrection seriously.
this is grim and i am no weeper
While I thought his passing would bring me a scythe of relief, I still don’t like him.
Well Walter, more bad news about our retirement account being inadequately funded.
No closure, ever!
They used to trim their fingernails.
It must be his coffee break.
Now we face everlasting life with Social Security going broke!
Shall we touch him to make sure he's dead?
Damn, now we will live together forever.
They said he had a condition
Well, that changes everything!
Well he got his just desserts.
Karma finally got him.
Who would had thought it would be the common cold that wiped him out?
Just because his name is Reaper doesn't mean he has to be a relative.
That's the guy I told you about --he said his plan provides everything for retirement
I guess God needed another angel.
He looks great, but you should have seen him last week.
Well, it worked perfectly well in the Everglades!
Looks as if we'll have to revise our itinerary...
If Chuck Norris says it’s not his time, it’s not his time.
God dammit. What are we gonna do now?
God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
I didn’t think he’d look so proud!
How could this happen? Karma! What goes around, comes around.
I
Morty always has been a slippery one.
It's hard to believe he's actually gone.
Death is dead , two negatives make a positive hence ... He Is Alive !
Crap--there go my plans for a fatal heart attack before the next election.
That's a surprise!
He's dead tired.
Looks like this time death lost.
His humanity metrics kept falling behind. In desperation, he tacked a bump stock to the scythe...and a misfire hoisted him by his own petard!
Believe me, he’s not Donne.
Oh dear, does this mean we'll live forever?
Your mom used to say, “ he should live so long”.
George, look. Even the Reaper died. He was our last hope.
I guess we don't have to worry about him being buried alive.
He looks so natural lying there.
“He’d just grown a little too confident with that scythe.” “He looks so natural, like he’ll pop up any minute now and go right back to reaping souls.” “He looks so natural, like he’ll pop up any minute now and reap our souls.
Turns out he's afraid of the dark.
I hear they're burying him with his dark horse.
The way I heard it, he was proud.
Maybe he's not done yet
You gently remove the scythe and I'll slam the lid.
He didn't look like that when he was alive.
Guess his scythe hurt his psyche
Looks like nap time for the Grim Reaper.
Well, it serves him right, I told him outsiders were not welcome.
I never fully grasped the depth of his obsession with the grim reaper. But looking at him here, I definitely see the resemblance. He does looks like death warmed over.
Poor Steve is daid. Poor Steve Bannon is daid...
Never could keep it simple...
The school shootings took the fun out of it for him
Does this mean the rest of us finally get eternal life?
I can't believe the Grim Reaper is dead
I'm going to contact our broker and have her buy shares in nursing homes.
Alas, poor Boris. I knew him, Harry, when he could handle both his job and his vodka.
I suggested he try this one on for scythe.
No. He's doing his stand-up.
Does this mean we don't have to file our income tax anymore?
I told him it wouldn’t work.
I doubt he will be missed
Does that mean we can go skydiving now?
The new mortician is taking their job a bit too gravely.
I told him to lighten up.
He looks livelier than ever.
He looked pale the last time he appeared before me.
'He finally reaped what he sowed." or "He finally got what he came for."
At least he dropped his first choice: the pearly gates tableau.
It's like when the bus driver gets off of the bus -- who's going to close the door?
The irony of death
farewell dear borris - is that a spade I see before me ?
His name was Satire.
A grim ending for The Reaper...
Is that an American scythe or an Austrian scythe?
Live by the sword...
I told him he wouldn't fit in if he didn't get rid of that thing.
What goes around comes around. At least he'll be buried in his favorite suit.
Harold, did you remember to bring the pin?
I hope he's happy in the "before-death".
He looks as natural as the day we found him on the doorstep.
Now that he's gone, it looks like we didn't save enough for retirment.
He always did enjoy a good meta narrative.
Does this mean we're next?
Couldn't they make him look little more grim?
It had to happen some time....
Does it go without saying that he looks sooo natural?
The world has lost a true icon.
Look on the bright side. We can cancel our life insurance policies.
He wanted to take his pitching wedge. Thought he could slice his way into heaven.
Agh! They did a terrible job of making him up. He looks too pale!
Does this mean we're gonna live forever?
He finally reaped himself." "Grim.
We were only acquaintances. Those who knew him best aren't able to say a few words.
This certainly puts paid to the concept of ZPG.
Now that he's finally dead, he looks so peaceful.
Get them before they get you
Maybe he was too proud.
It was the sticks and stones that finished him off.
Unfortunately, the President didn't believe in him either.
He died of natural causes. Dying came to him naturally.
He received so little encouragement, he felt his life lacked purpose.
Early retirement must be nice.
Yes of course I feel bad, but it was either him orus.
Like the man said, “Death, Be Not Proud.”
I’m starting to believe all the Chuck Norris hype.
Now do you believe me? The Mayan Apocalypse actually happened.
He always loved Halloween.
Guess he had it coming.
Yep.... That’s him alright.
so, should we cancel the term life?' "free at last, free at last" "boy Fred, just in time heh?" "now, if we could just get our youth back" "who said there's no rest for the wicked" "so, do we still need a will?
You have to agree, George, death became her.
So much for a sense of relief---did you catch the rest of the family?
All those years we thought he wasn't serious about making our life insurance policy a good investment.
I am sorry to see him go, i was hoping for a visit from him
Yes, that's certain. Taxes have been too, pending release.
That will never make it past security.
Well, it has started out as a strange aeon, I guess Lovecraft was right.
He tried to get ahead of himself and reaped as he'd sown.
I'm rubber, you're glue...
No riders, he's a cloud hitchhacker.
Gee, who saw this coming?
Better him than us.
I knew I was contagious! I coughed in his face and he keeled right over!
Does this mean we won't die anymore?
No, he’s just in a time-out.
Was it suicide or natural causes?
In certain professions, empathy can kill you.
Darn. Now we'll have to recalculate our retirement plan.
Uh-oh they say death comes in threes.
I told the sob not to take on my Ernie!
I know this is going to sound really random but we ought to cancel our cable service.
Wow, he's finally gone. I guess we can stop worrying about our own mortality now.
he was just out of time.
I always said " Don't look so grim."
Don't give me that what we sew we also reap business!
With him gone, I guess we're stuck here.
They killed Kenny!
Is this the guy you thought was hanging around by the back door last week?
No, you can't take it with you!
The poor bastard never saw it coming.
I knew he had sold his soul long ago, but when Trump said he'd made deal of a lifetime I would have never imagined this.
We'll, everybody has to start somewhere.
Looks like the death of dying.
Now we'll never finish that game of chess.
I wonder who he's taking with him this time?
I guess we’ll need to contact the Bishop about an annulment
They did a lousy job on his make up. Look how pale he is.
He looks a little warmed over to me.
He certainly did throw himself into his work.
"This one has nice neck and back support but I am afraid it may be breathable".
I forgot to wind the clock !
I don't fear death anymore... but I fear that damn weapon.
He was a lousy doctor.
I never liked open coffins.
Does this mean I'm doomed to live in this body for eternity?
He always was a poseur.
There's dead and then there's Death.
He looks so lifelike, it's hard to believe he's gone.
Death Coffin
"Are you sure it's the right person?".
Says he overdosed on 'soul juice'.
So he strolls into my club, grabs the open mic, and says he’s going to kill.
He never looked so good in his life.
They always said, "You can't escape death or taxes."
I think he was a famous Russian spy in a James Bond movie.
Do you think we'll still get the obituary page?
She never went anywhere without that scythe.
I'm not sure about this Henry; they told me he's be warmed over.
He was a good scythe.
I wonder who's going to do his taxes?
Till death do us part
Well that’s official-now his taxes..
Does this mean we are here to stay?
Lived by the scythe, reaped by the scythe.
Times over
How are you fixed for blades NOW?
I guess John Donne was right.
I kept telling him not to touch himself.
Immortality is a lot more mundane than I imagined.
Bernoulli would have given him a ‘lift’
Every week...same story...wants it to surprise a friend he says. Comfy sir?
Preposterous hubris of human being
I kept telling him it was only a matter of time but he wouldn't listen.
They couldn't remove the hoodie for an open casket?
There goes our retirement plans.
So much for ZPG!
Once a prankster always a prankster.
In the end, you reap what you sow.
The Grim Reaper, 2018: Ironic Phase
It must have been a case of 'hot pursuit.'
Well now what?
If you think rest home rooms were tough to get before...
They said it was an accident, he doesn't look surprised.
He looks livelier now than he ever did.
I should have never left him for you Barry! He was so handy around the house and in the garden.
I've lost the will to live.
Sickle cell scares me.
Life killed him.
I knew that shouldn’t have armed the first grade teacher.
I will always see him as our innocent little boy.
Over before we could say boo, hah. Our “boo” scared him to death.
Harvey always liked dramatic departures
I'll bet that Lake of Fire is a real bitch.
...an AR-15, eh?
There goes our social life.
It was a tragic case of physician heal thyself.
He looks so natural.
So I told him, 'I didn't ask for a scythe order of death.' And he collapsed.
Well, he was always a little different.
Looks warmed over.
I told him not to mess with Chuck Norris.
"My guess is he'll give this one four stars".
I hope he left a will. I've heard he did a lot of sowing with all that reaping.
Like we told you; you can never go home.
Serves him right! About time for a little payback.
He seemed so alive just last week.
Huh...apparently the AR-15 worked on him!
"You would think he would have wanted to be cremated".
I can still hear him saying, 'ABC...Always be closing.'
did you just hear death say "til' death dies do we part."?
Well, this one will not be coming back.
Serves him right - he got a taste of his own medicine.
Too bad I just invested in funeral homes.
His IRA invested in crypto and next day he fell on his scythe.
He said he wasn't going down without a fight.
Is that updated upholstery I feel? What a time to be alive!
Applications are located to your left
I think that's what the kids call karma.
Now that’s what I call a meta Morpheus.
He was depressed because he missed us!
Does this mean it's the end of all of us - the end of all of us?
I suspect it was DirecTV
I was so looking forward to his visit .
He was a big Charles Bronson fan!
"Death was always getting in are way".
I told you my chess group would come in handy.
See folks? It's that easy.
Oy, I can't decide if he is a putz or a mensch.
Do you know the cause?
He never could fit in.
Even the grim reaper has a grim reaper......who knew?
After the Trump wall they are trying new ways to cross the border.
Last time one of these guys kicked we were out of business for about three months, or so. How's Aruba sound?
He looks warmed over, but not proud.
I hear the kids are suing for wrongful death.
Pay no attention to him he just finally finished his taxes.
Wasn't he reaped by one of his own?
The mortician did a good job." "Yeah, still looks alive.
I hear it was burnout finally got him.
I was expecting more of a puckish smile.
He must have seen The Emoji Movie.
Asleep on the job again!
I was hoping the undertaker would have dressed him in something more cheery.
Don’t he look natural?
What
I don't expect a crowd at the funeral Love.
He tried on Tommy's VR glasses and met himself in a game.
There is a light at the end of the rainbow. With the Grim Ripper dead, we will now have eternal life..but do we want it with all the guns, shooting, and corruption?" "Lord, please let me take his place.
Now when your times up they send a sex robot.
I must have told him a thousand times. “What goes around, comes around...” but he never listened and now he has to wear black to the funeral. What can I say?
No tweets from here I hope...
Enough with the drama!
From what I understand, the whole process was converted to a mobile app.
Now who do we tell when it's "our time?"
It's what he wanted but I'll miss his stories.
I was thinking of killing myself. Now what am I going to do?
Is this a gender-neutral funeral?
I guess this really is the end.
Henry, it looks like I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands . . .
Does " 'til death do us part" still apply?
He should have known better, I told him I would leave after girls night out.
Kind of like the shoemaker's children.
They say he lost his job and then he lost his mind
All it took was being replaced by a robot.
The hardest part of death is learning to live without them.
The Reaper's seemed like a nice family, but I'm not surprised that Grim met an early demise.
I think this explains why he incessantly played AC/DC's 'Highway to Hell.'
I guess he's off line.
He looks so natural, doesn't he?
As humans we've finally achieved immortality through technology, yet I'm stuck with this body.
I told him he was working himself to death and ought to take a vacation.
Well shoot, that only leaves us with taxes, huh?
I do admire Leonard Zelig's integrity.
It’s at the request of the family. He’s being buried with his favorite scythe.
He was so alive before #Me too. 3
I don't think he looks grim.
I always forget. Is it ' you sow what you reap, or reap what you sow'? I'm confused.
Now, Mrs Jones don’t be alarmed, Some days even the devil sits back and admirers my work.
You put the scythe in please, dear
Go check if this means we can also stop paying our taxes
Counterintuitive!
Is this something to do with that 'reap what you sow' stuff he was always talking about?
The Grim Reaper's final harvest.
Oy, so now we'll be married forever ??
I wonder if he saw it coming.
He looks like death cooled down
I'm not sure. Maybe we could call an Uber.
How can death die? And who's going to take over the grim reaping?
While he looks so peaceful, we can still cremate.
For the life of me I do not recognize the deceased
Satire's funeral.
Evidently Phil's act didn't fool everyone.
Is that a threat?
Gosh, I suppose this means it didn't avoid Taxes, either.
We're looking at Death's Dior
Seriously Lynn, he doesn't look so good.
I would have thought they would be a better sales person!
If only he were as sharp as his scythe.
He was there for me when I went through my divorce.
They say he looked in a mirror
he was always there when it mattered most
He sure liked to sow, then to reap and sow again - such a full life.
... And he also killed as a landscaper
Well. I told him about that mirror time and time again.
If I told him once, I've said another 100 times, 'No running in the house when you got sharp things in your hands!'
Let's call the accountant and make sure we need to file this year.
She killed him with a vacuum cleaner. Apparently the only way to win was Dyson with Death.
Good riddance. He always wanted us to keep the “th” silent.
Who's going to take care of us now?
Actually, I am feeling refreshed
Heaven Control directs us to runway J as in John, Three Sixteen-er.
Damn you Chuck Norris!
I guess the next guy gets a new scythe
He must not have paid his taxes.
Did you put the For Sale sign out front yet?
Grim indeed, now what?
Why is he in a coffin? I thought he would burn in hell?
I did tell him Bobby not to go dressed like that to the Retirement Home, Ohh, he didn't have a chance.
I guess his time was finally up.
I always thought I would die before him.
Looks like he reaped himself.
I don't know if his hunger for attention is pathetic or funny, but he sure insists on always being in your face.
He never looked nicer.
They said that he had the time of his death last night
He was made redundant.
I imagine his untimely death could portend good news—for some couples.
I told him to lose the scythe.
Serves you right, smarty pants!
Say what you will, he tried hard to make up for his day job with all his philanthropic endeavors.
OK, the sincerest form of flattery but maybe not the most effective.
Now this model is a little more than we talked about, but give it 5 minutes and tell me what you think.
That was definitely one of the more interesting eulogies I've heard.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Doesn't he look like himself?
I wonder if they had a succession plan?
He was a good son. People would just die just to be near him.
No one should outlive their child, but hey.
Irony was his middle name.
Martin Shkreli was not a good man.
His time was up.
He's never looked less grim.
We usually wait, but you guys are slated for an early arrival.
Halloween was his favorite day of the year.
I don't think this means we have eternal life.
He just didn’t see that combine coming. Big Ag has beat the reaper
Not bad for a decoy.
He wanted a thematic funeral but I don't know how to fit that darn sickle into the coffin!
Still think we should have paid for those Performance Art classes?
He looks almost lifelike.
Like me, he needed a firm deadline to get things done.
I won't dare axe how he died?
Thank goodness we bought long-term care insurance.
No more Death sounds good but I'll miss his quiche.
At least he's finally out of his ecstasy
So this is how your brother Mort cheated Death?
I heard it was the all the crisis actors that did him in.
What was the point?
goes to show ya it can happen to anyone-slipped on some ice -its over!
So I guess we no longer can count on dying
Gotcha last.
In his case, no sewing, all reaping.
And now, who the hell will be tearing us apart?
I knew those selfies were dangerous.
That smile, though.
... and now what ?
Now what do we do?
Tweet dreams, darlin'.
I guess 'Time' finally caught up with him!
They didn’t do such a bad job with him.
Hmm... Death takes a busman's holiday.
This year’s crop must have been especially bad
He's in victim empathy training.
Now we're in real trouble with over population.
Does this mean we are the last ones standing? Frick.
Death finds a way.
-“And with stranger aeons, even death may die.” -lol wut
I always felt he was a bearer of bad news.
He didn't realize the appointment in Sumera was for him.
They say someone quoted 'Physician heal thyself' to him.
I didn't know it was contagious.
He was always such a smart dresser.
I told him he needed help, but he just wouldn't listen.
I figured I'd beat him there.
Oh, he looks so deathlike!
Now we can look forward to a nice long life.
What comes around,goes around.
May the Reap R.I.P.
Live by the sword, die by the sword.
They did a good job on his make-up - he looks very lifelike.
Death really does come to us all!
A “Reaper Sleeper”!
Who's going to take care of us now?
Better than wasting a perfectly good suit.
Well, I guess all things come to an end.
I guess this means we can shred the will.
This casket must be just right.
Well, if God is dead, doesn't it make sense that Death is too?
He's never looked so natural.
Nobody can cheat
In the digital economy, nothing dies, so his position was eliminated.
So this is what it feels like
Hmmm. Maybe he was too good at cosplay.
I think Jimmy's trying to tell us something.
He loved putting people out of business, and out of commission, if you know what I mean.
He must've been kicked off an overbooked flight.
So you're going into retirement? Everybody lives!
They all become disillusioned with Cloud 9 when the drugs run out.
Is that a Casper mattress?
He had a good run.
Let’s pay tribute with hers favorite cheering: RIP RIP HOORAY!
The Angel cake killed Him?
Hell of a way to find out you have a twin.
It came with the frame.
He would have wanted it this way
Now I'm worried, he did my Income Tax returns last year!
Gosh, I didn't think Trump was serious when he said immigrants would be uploaded to the cloud.
I pray for her sake this Facebook profile gets lots of "likes".
This seriously slays my exit plan.
...and I always thought he was such a sweetie!
So there's no more Death to part us? I must already be in Hell.
Well, it's not politically correct to say the "fat lady" any more, so this seems to make sense.
They say he had been going downhill since his last divorce.
Well, this kills the one-child policy!
And he just had it dry cleaned.
Doesn't that look like Jack Kerouac?
I refuse to believe it was suicide.
Great. We can forget about our Plan B for retirement.
Oy - gives me the chills! We couldn't just make a shiva call?
We were just renting it to him! Nobody thought he'd become a grim-squatter.
You didn't hear it from me but the casket is gonna be hard to close if you know what I mean.
That reminds me...we're all out of canned salmon again.
Where's Alanis Morissette when you need her?"
He looks so supernatural.
He was just made for that coffin!
Is it me, or does he looked "warmed over"?
He fought it all the way.
Don’t worry folks, you’ll get your turn.
It's more for the instant gratification crowd.
Memento mori . . . as they say.
Thumbs up....I like the kid's optimism
Well, pop goes the weasel
The police suspect that Kersey guy.
He bombed in New Haven.
Keep going, I've got a feeling this one's no angel.
Even as a kid, I mean, with the pets.
His last words were "What the hell do I care if you're rubber and I'm glue?!"
Who knew they had internecine feuds?
I told you not to hire that guy with a scythe.
Ag school was a big mistake!
I'll be honest; this really creeps me out, Gary!
I wonder if his job came with life insurance
He just cinched the doctrine of reincarnation.
He passed away right after Mrs. Higgins, a devoted wife and mother, age 78, appeared at his door.
Get in touch with the building; grab the apartment and I secure grimreaper.com.
I told her she'd end up this way if she didn't cut out the dairy.
Our retirement cannot last forever!
What the hell is that?
Finally, I've been dying to get him off my back.
He always said he refused to be a member of a club that would have him as a member.
I told you the Grim Brothers' stories don't end well
He always said he'd go when he was damn well ready, and not before...
It's for an episode of "Undercover Bosses."
Uncle Fred always was a lady killer.
You know, Henry. He doesn't look so warmed over.
But he was so young!
He finally accepted the Buy out when they threw in Tuition Remission for his dependents for any qualified ring of hell.
Our whole married life I've never understood him.
Tax season was too much for him this year.
He had so much to live for
To dig his own grave, quite literally!!!
But, it was my mother's recipe. I've used it for years. Could it. be allergies, you think?
Yes, dear. But you should have seen what she wore to her birthday brunch...
So then we'll be married lots longer than we'd thought...?
Oh no, now who is going to tell us it is our time?
But he was so young!
Actually, it's two less visitations to look forward to.
We can still count or taxes. or It really was a bade flu season.
May he rest in pieces.
I like the peek-a-boo option.
What kind of leasing options do you offer?
I still don't feel good about signing the register.
How many times did we tell him...be careful with that scythe.
He just couldn’t handle the fame.
They decided to go with pine for the casket. Unbelievable.
If you're looking for something a little more grandiose, this metronome keeps time and tells you when it's "your time."
Sir, I might not live to regret this, but I think you got the setup wrong
Your father may have looked like "death warmed over" for the last 60 years, but I still think enough is enough.
I told you that Vitamix would pay off.
He read John Owens, and just gave up.
That can't be him. He looks too lifelike.
They charge extra for the carry-on scythe.
Does this mean I'm immortal in this body?
He said he was going to meet it head on.
I call it Karma - he was able to cheat on his taxes for years . . .
He simply refused to use that riding mower we bought for him.
There goes our budget for the rest of the year
Where oh death is your victory? Where, oh death, is your sting?
I don't understand the image. What's the pole coming into the head of the casket? What is the shape where the head should be?
See what happens when you die during a gravediggers strike!
"Why such a sparkling scythe, plus he died with that silly grin. No heart for that job, I'll say.
He looks so peaceful, Howard.
Oh, no! If Death is dead we're going to have to live forever and be responsible to next generations for all of eternity. This will be a worse job than being a cherubim or seraphim who has to chant with ceaseless voice and sleepless eye.
Snuffed out in the prime of death.
At least he can't get sneak up and get us now.
My oh my. I never expected this to happen so soon.
pray for the redundent
She thought no one could come for her.
They won't be able to shut the lid.
They call it doubling down
Stop
Maybe he'd be willing to keep the cemetery lawn tidy.
At least they made him look good for the funeral.
I suppose God got tired of being up-staged.
Oh, my! The Trump administration took its toll on him too.
So who’s next in line?
Arthur, I feel this is too macabre for your sickle cell anemia campaign!
I know deliveries are tough, but the break room would be a better place for a nap !
We should have known he was just one of Death's elves.
Always knew she’s cheat death...
That’s his best suit?
Where has Father Time gone?
Just deserts?
Looks like he finally got his death-wish.
Maybe if we gave him a sickle instead we could close the goddam lid!
Well, now who's gonna reap us?
He said, Harold, that he's been waiting here for you.
I thought you said Death's door would be a closed casket.
You reap as you mow
So that's what death looks like?
Can you hear me, David? I said, "Don't be proud."
It's his safe space.
His bones are so white and natural-looking you wouldn't think he was Death.
He wanted a different a different perspective.
I guess he wanted one for the road.
Do you suppose this means that now we’re all immortal?
Well at least he didn't give up without a fight.
It’s a boy!
The scythe is passed
I never thought this day would come--I finally have a chance to use the word meta.
Looks like the steel tariff cost him his job.
Well, Fred, looks like "till death do us part" is no longer in the cards.
He was an architect of his own demise. Should have used hand sanitizer.
He just collapsed when he saw the price of a new aluminum scythe
He's in a better place.
They sure do make 'em look life-like!
He looks so generic.
You can’t expect much of a turnout for such a sow and sow.
I wonder what happens to our longevity?
You sure it's the whim greeter?
He tried to kill the #MeToo movement.
Never met the guy, but now that he's done, I kinda wish we'd gotten the chance to chat
His nanny told me the poor sap didn't even invest in life insurance.
He looks so cute when he's sleeping.
Dang! You really can't take it with you.
He looks at peace.
Cremation is so much cheaper.
I say sell our funeral home stocks!
Guess what Mel? Blue Oyster Cult was right after all....
Fight or flight? He's always been an enigma.
A scythe? How are we supposed to get this thing to close, Goerge?
I think he was just trying to be funny.
It was an occupational hazard.
On a lighter note, Mom was right. Heart attacks are good for the face.
Did he just say the line starts HERE!
"Till death do us part," they said.
The late Mr. Smidget. Even death has to wait for him.
I hear Alaniss Morissette will be singing a dirge.
I wonder if he’ll stay dead this time
Gone too soon
Sales are contingent upon Death.
I told him not to interrupt my show.
It should have been me.
He looks so peaceful now, doesn’t he?
I never knew she could look so personified in death.
I told him to cut down, but he wouldn't listen.
Thank God it's over.
The old dear left me his collection of Precious Moments.
He should have feared the reaper.
I told you that we should have got him the scythes size.
I knew we got the cryogenic subscription too soon.
He looked better on the reality show.
Huh? Are we immortal now? Oy!
They did a good job...He's never looked better
Oh, Harvey, no one told us it was going to be a masquerade-themed funeral. We’ll be the only ones not in costume.
And with him, our dreams of retirement die as well.
He's irreplaceable!
He and his twin had a stare-down. He won.
He was always so darn serious.
Well, yes of course...but he always looked, "Peaceful.
I guess a diet of human flesh and bones wasn't a good idea, huh?
He wants to be a role model
Modern medicine saved the rest of us....
I this what they mean by until death to us part?
He couldn't even fake his own death right.
Who's gonna cut the grass now?
Didn't anyone ever tell him not to run with sharp objects?
What a waste, those 3 years in federal prison, because he didn't believe in taxes either.
He took my crock pot with him.
Not to worry. He had himself cloned.
I always said that the smoke would kill him one day.
Ironically, he died after tripping and falling on his scythe.
Early Bird is going to get crowded.
You promised us it would be death do us part...
His HMO was not so great!
There have been no deaths reported since the Grim Reaper died.
He died a very grim death...
I swear that guy looks just like my hit and run.
I thought death was supposed to be the new alive.
He accidentally looked in a mirror.
Whew, that was close. Now that he's gone, we can rest easy.
Well he and the grim reaper really hit it off.
Not sure the open casket is the wisest choice, but it is so Grim
Guess it had to be an open casket viewing.
Don't stop. Something about him just doesn't look right.
Opioid manufacturers worked him to death.
Method acting at its best
now how’s death going to ‘death do us apart’?
Wow, does this mean we live forever?
Death is so fragile.
I agree -- the white disco suit would have been far more macabre!
I have this sudden urge to buy green bananas
Yes, it's nice but how long is the warranty?
Did the good Lord really have to take her on Halloween?
Father Time's watch must have stopped!
This better not mean I am going to live forever.
Did you notice that he always seemed to take the air out of the room?
If he plans on escorting himself to ‘the other side’, his window of opportunity is about to close.
I've got to admit I was sick of him hanging around!
Larry, now that we're immortals you can finally downgrade the health insurance and buy that Mercedes you've always wanted.
Who's next? God?!
Laying down on the job again! He should be called ‘The Grim Sleeper’!
You know, he never came across as being that religious.
I just wanted a mirror to add a little light.
She really was an ironical costume designer.
Sow. Reap. Weep.
Does this mean we're immortal?
Staring the coffin, we don't understand when we reunite to our parents.
I told him, an AR15 would fit, but he's strong on his image.
-What a shame. He was always the life of the party. -They say that Life killed him.
You can take it with you.
Goodbye first love.
He was reaped off.
He is trying to build empathy.
You’d think he’d know not to look in a mirror.
Like they say...Death and taxes.
This exercise is supposed to instill empathy.
Death and Taxes; You would think he'd have an upper hand on one of them.
Why do you suppose the New Yorker Caption Contest cartoonists have a thing for the grim reaper?
A busman's holiday? Oh, I get it now!
Tag can be dangerous.
She always said that death becomes her.
Did you place the Ad for a replacement?
I don't know whether to mourn or celebrate.
What's with all the props?
Who's getting the fur?" "We are.
Just like my randy first husband – we couldn’t get the casket shut without a saw
He always wanted to know what it would be like to be in one.
Now we can get that condo in Aruba.
It was heart failure
He worked so hard, and for what?
Ai yai yai
Are we sure he's just not napping?
Ha ha, Grim Reaper. You reap what you sow!
Of course, in life, he looked much more like himself.
Are you sure he wanted to be buried in his Seventh Seal costume as it does mean a getting a bigger coffin?
Not to speak ill of the dead, but cats got to his pride.
I told him that last double Margarita would be the death of him.
What are we going to do now?

Bert, men are all the same, deadbeats!
We are going to need some body parts replaced.
May the Donald Rest In Peace.
You be the judge.
Do you really think it would mind a cheaper casket?
So Much for living forever
And to think, he just had tea with Barbara-Ann last week.
Ironically he was so lonely that he decided to relieve some sexual tension by masturbating, and his own touch killed him.
It’s a dying breed
I warned him against wearing that costume...
I hear he had to pay taxes too.
He was always lying down on the job.
I wonder if he filed his 1040.
Dear George, thrifty to the end.
H won't try that again!
This isn't quite how I remember Dave.
I guess his reign ended with the new electric, driverless models.
I can't believe how deathlike he looks.
A dyed-in-the-wool workaholic. I knew he'd never retire!
He's trying to trick us.
Don't assume it is not your turn, he is just taking a nap.
He does look rather grim.
(voice from above): :This is Jesus. See?? Didn't I tell you I'd conquer death?"
Looks like he's grasped his last sythe.
It was his last wish. He thought he could have one on his brother in law, but then, we’ll never know.
Isn't there something missing?
Who would've thought that he could be deader than dead?
I don't want to bury the hatchet.
He didn't have a friend in the world.
Apparently he lost a game of chess to a knight
I hear he came from the hood.
He was an ophthalmologist. He invented the Scythe for Sore Eyes.
Now that Mr. death is dead, what do we have to look forward to?
O Death where is thy scythe?
He said he wanted to try out this new Doornail model.
After so many years alone, he'll finally get to join all the friends he killed.
He was feared and dreaded by so many people, but he was a great dad. Did you know he taught me how to hunt for rabbits with just my finger?
You should pay his taxes for him
Shroud be not death
Do you like this one it's on sale and they have a lay away program.
I didn't quite expect that when I wished to meet death
Now, "It'll be easy", to live to 1000+.
Too bad the scythe didn't fit.
His widow's gonna make a killing.
I'm glad you shot him.
He wasn't relevant anymore.
Death to false metal.
I approve.
It's a trap!
I just did not realize he had a nighttime job.
It happened when he lost at a game of chess.
George looks as grim in death as he did in life.
She was reaped, not raped!
I never thought he'd lose to a queen's gambit.
Looks like he's taken his last scythe.
He never was that good at chess.
He's not only the President, he's a customer!
Death 0 Humans 1
Another Clinton campaign and DNC screw up trying to get rid of Trump. Too bad Luca Brasi went to live with the fishes.
That's Alec Baldwin!
I don't care if even 'he' thinks it's comfortable, George. I'm not ready!
He died doing what he loved best, maim & murder
He was so young.
My oncologist...
Looks like the worm has turned for you, my friend.
I'm not telling him that he's got to move.
He's just resting for the mid terms.
I wanted to make sure he was really dead.
It’s not your husband, He beat death.
Guess this means we'll be together forever.
He mumbled something about "agent orange" and fell on his scythe.
Don't kneel, it's a trap.
He'll be remembered for boring everyone he met to death.
Well, Gladys will certainly have something to say about this at Bridge next week.
He's never looked better.
I just want to reap in peace.
I guess it’s true after all. You do reap what you sow.
It's cheaper if we come to him.
That's what 'all work and no play,' gets you.
They say it was a family squabble. His brother wanted the job.
He was always larger than life.
Oh, wow they did a great job.
I guess we have a long life ahead of us.
After death: resurrection?
You've been singing "L'Chaim" since 1964. It finally worked!!
The end of an era.
The harvest has ended
Bill's mother-in-law is here. He'd like to swap back.
I
I understand there are no applicants for his job.
I had my firearm when he arrived and now its him and not me.
They say it was suicide
He's dead tired.
Caskey: “I wonder who broke the news to him.”
By Herb, guess you got your smaller quieter place.
"Gluten-free" got 'em!
Nice suit shame he only got to wear it once.
Clever communist -- saying he's red AND dead.
He was known and feared by millions as '@thegrimtweeter.'
I wonder if It paid It's taxes first.
Chester was always so macabre.
And now...what are we gonna do?
Scythe!
I wonder how he keeps his blacks from fading
A parent should never outlive her child.
His coloring is good
Harold, does this mean I'm stuck with you for eternity?
What comes around...
I guess it's true, Henry...Death shall be no more; death shalt die.
Frankly, I don't know how he went so long without touching himself.
I told you we had too many weeds.
Sorry Grim but your April Fool's day antics were getting very tiresome
He was nothing but bones at the end.
OK, Stan - is THIS irony?
FAKE DEATH!
Now that's shameless product placement.
They say he took it with him.
Last I talked to him he was trying to get unemployment benefits.
Nah..he’s just dead tired.
If he’s not delivering, do we still tip?
I always thought he'd make it.
Working with so many difficult people was just starting the make the work intolerable.
So, I guess we're safe for eternity.
He ended up in a good place.
Well now, that's taking the reaper guy a little too far! Don't you think!
He's showing us how easy it is.
He'll never rest in peace.
Do you really think this means we won't have to face him?
I envy his position.
What was it this time?
He's still going to be the death of me.
I think the trade wars must have done him in.
I guess it's time to bury the scythe.
Just five more minutes, mom...
They won't be able to close the top.
I just wish he hadn't worked so hard!
I told him to take it easy. He's been working his fingers to the bone.
It's so sad. He was anyways so negative.
That dude has one weird sense of humor.
They said he was just devastated when no one was willing to 'friend' him on Facebook.
The outfit cost almost $500, but then they offered him a permanent job.
So, do you think he uses the same coffin every time?
So this is what Lovecraft meant by even death may die.
Live by the scythe, die by the scythe.
So, like, do we all live forever now?
"Insurance" was Jim's middle name.
Well, I guess we're immortals now.
We need the Time to cut off the wood handle so he fits inside the casket. He won't need it where he's going.
I thought that he was speaking in 3rd person when he said that he was knocking on death's door.
They've taken the super-economy fare to new heights.
Will the bagpipe fit too?
Trying to get around the carry on limit?
The Franciscans have quite a work ethic.
I warned him not to mess with Chuck Norris. You reap what you sow.
What are we supposed to fear now?
Well now how are we going to get Nana to behave?
They say he really loved something called Cosplay. I wish he would've worn his blue suit.
So you thought you knew "grim"?
Barney always said you could have the scythe went you pried it from his cold, dead hands.
You're wrong - he died on the scythe of April.
I won’t forget your 7 iron, dear.
I suppose you were right. It wasn't a heart attack after all.
Wow... when the Grim Reaper decides to check out – it makes you wonder what he knew?
He can't take the scythe with him. It doesn't fit.
Poor guy! He never made it out of 2017.
#TIMESUP #METOO
Ain’t karma a bitch!
It really makes you think about your own immortality.
He looks so natural just dying there  or Was he one of the Brothers Grim?  or I thought he'd never stop talking
Well, what now?
Welp, that settles that. Karma has the longest reach!
They say the best defense is a good offense.
I didn’t know grim reapers died.
He doesn’t look the least bit life-like.
What's his wife's name? Edith, is it Edith?
And he told ME not to bother with the flu shot.
And there I thought he was being ridiculous enough when he took a holiday.
Just tell his wife that he looks good. Don't mention that they need to fix his mouth.
Well he always said, always a reaper never a reaped
Arbeit macht frei
It’s impissible to close the lid in the grim reaper
He must have had a hard day.
Well, my dear, there goes our alternative to divorce....
I heard he got tired of trying to compete with the flu virus this year
He said he never go down without a fight.
I'll bet I know who put him here, Mrs. Grim Reaper.
The grim reaper wants to know what it's like
I guess even Death take a holiday.
'Judging from speeches, he was an angel.'
Donne tole you a long time ago, but would you listen?
I guess what goes around comes around--thank heavens!
Apparently, the steel was imported.
What's the past tense of "reap?" OR He looks rather better, don't you think?
It lacks a human element.
Never in my worst nightmares did I ever imagine that I'd live long enough to see Democracy mowed down and lying in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda!
Now he’ll sow what he reaped
Well, the signal permits a pedestrian to begin crossing a street during the "Walk" display, and Death thought he was exempt, who knew?
Not quite what he expected.
He must be enjoying his just deserts.
I'm not really surprised, he's been deathly ill lately.
Good looking corpse #wtf
Does this mean another fifty years of marriage?
Didn't I say make him look like an angel in death ?
Don't they usually put them in an urn?
Looking at him, makes me sickle.
Does this mean God is still dead?
See? I told you it wasn't comfy
I guess he couldn't handle the death of Communism in Russia.
We're right over San Quentin. We better keep going.
Well, he did enter our living room.
'Death takes a busman's holiday.' What, too soon?
Keep going. That bag will never fit in the overhead bins.
His son will be taking over the business.
I'm pretty sure that qualifies as harassment
He is just checking out fit and function.
The shoe doesn’t fit
I think he has taken this cosplay thing a bit far don't you Harold?
Edward loved that Hallowe’en costume.
I told him that working all hours would be the death of him.
He had a real passion for Bergman cosplay.
He was always a good boy...in death and in death.
He tried playing AlphaGo.
He was a great guy. Not.
Pete was always such a ham.
Healer, heal thyself.
Payback are hell!
This reminds me of that irony the kids are always talking about.
I'm told he met a grim ending.
Ahh, she'll be back.
To end it all, he had to fall on his own scythe.
Well I guess that makes us immortal.
I know they say dress for the job you want ...
Oh my, and they thought there were too many seniors before this.
Why couldn't it have been you?
I think I've created my own hell.
With modern medicine, I guess this really is a dream. But I still feel old.
I knew it, he knew it, we all knew his time was coming up.
They say he digs his own grave.
I hear he died of a bite from a snake...devouring its own tail.
Where are the beads?
He joined ISIS and got what he deserved.
They say he missed his seasonal quota by one and decided to take his own life to make up for it. Poor guy said it was easier.
Does that mean we are immortals now?
"He's been always sure he wasn't going to heaven:
Can I get a ruling on this lie? Where is relief without penalty?
I’m not afraid of dying, I just don’t want to be seen like this.
"Go get the Ouija board".
I'm more partial to the entertainment center coffin...
Damn! I better call our broker.
He was finally replaced by a modern harvester/reaper.
It was Bound to Happen, something to do with the changing climates, I guess..
They did warn that it would be a post-modern service.
Inception was a horrible movie.
The irony of it!..... He came to our house for dinner, talked about our time is up, and then keeled over.
The Funeral Home did a great job, he looks so alive. Bless his heart he won't see the billing for this open casket service and burial...
We can't pick up anyone. We just dragged a passenger off the plane, before we took off
Now what's the point of living, OR dying anymore?
Herb, I swear Grim is no other than my high school Latin teacher!
So the reaper was reaped!
He died as he had lived
A very good Friday, but a bad Sunday.
They say his job killed him.
It's about time!
Uh-oh. How are Blue Öyster Cult fans going to handle this?
I hear he's got a side job as a spokesman for the casket company.
It’s a trap to get us to the viewing.
Ultimately, association really does breed assimilation.
I see he's trying out yet another bed!
Now what are we going to do?
It's bound for hell.
Natural fibers are all the rage, but he probably shouldn't have gone with wool...
There goes our ride home. We'll need to get a Lyft.
This is what happens when you don't take enough time off.
One thing you can say in her favor, nobody ever needed an inclusion rider.
He looks 10 years younger.
??« It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you »??
Honey, I know it's not nice to speak ill of the dead, but good riddance, he won't tease us anymore!
He with his axe in his hand,
That's a top of the line coffin. Maybe we should prepay too.
who reaped the reaper
I wonder if there are going to be enough hours in the day for political news AND zombie news.
He came for me. Ha!
Don't know what I'll do without his unique perspective.
Wacky, but in the best sense.
I think it was sickle cell anaemia.
Cos player.
He tended too overdress.
I told Jason to stop playing video games!
Well, he defeated death.
Look honey, not only a place to spend eternity but to meet it as well.
I thought he was just on a holiday.
It’s funny, y’know. I actually can’t believe he’s dead!
Poor Ethel.
That was certain to happen.
Should we pray?
He hung on like grim death.
He went to bed early last night!
He's keeping it cold for me.
May he rest in pieces.
We should invest in real estate.
Look, he's sleeping on the job again.
Pretty grim to see reap like this
I told him that so much work will kill him!
I TOLD him to be not proud... ("TOLD" should be italicized)
Why are you surprised? His job required that he walk around with a giant sharp blade!
How can the casket be closed with that scythe sticking out of it!
That rouge really brings out the cheek bones.
Hale fellow, well met.
It's HOPE!" ... "It's IRONY!" ... "HOPE!!!" ... "IRONY!!!
I kept telling him to wear a condom.
I should have told him his grimness was a real downer.
It was a smash-a graveyard smash.
That Irving, always such a killjoy!
I hear he got stung.
So this is what it feels like
He told me and I quote "with the way America is handling its foreign policy lately he just couldn't face the upcoming workload" and he laid down and died
Think we're all dead?
The Reaper doesn't fear the Seasons, nor do the wind, the sun or the rain.
He thought he could defeat the Surly Reaper.
This should give Adam and Eve a little cover.
Well ain't that meta.
Killed by Death
Do you think we can celebrate?
In a world that understands less and less the power of metaphor, let's say "Goodbye" to the Grim Reaper.
Is that a 1099 I see there?
Even the grim reaper cannot survive that many deaths in a video game.
Does this mean we will NEVER get that knock on the door?
I wonder if he had a good death insurance policy.
Does this mean we have to 'Part'?
I'll always remember him as a clean cut guy.
Hopefully he will learn that being nice delays our turn with the Grim Reaper.
It looks like the nuns were right: Masturbation really _is_ bad for you!
Looks like the end days, honey.
So it's true. He really has taken the great equalizing a step too far.
we'll pick him up on the way back if he is still there.
He was just all bones at the end.
NOW ISN'T THAT A LOVING SMIRK?
I told you if you weren't careful with that coffin you'd catch your death.
Oh my God, did they ever find the diamond?
I guess he'll be missed by them reapers.
Death and taxes; am I right?
That's so meta.
There lies Death. So be it!
Even now, the jerk won't retire.
They said it was a suicide.
He caught a bad bug in Samarra.
His note said he preferred this to the new Fall lineup..
They finally got time in a bottle.
Well, he did cut corners, didn't he?
His family had a viewing of The Seventh Seal at the wake.
I guess no one lives forever.
History will remember him as 'Jack the Reaper'.
Either he's on strike or it's another flight delay.
He was a good listener.
Mmm ... must be a killer app ...
It's really an honor to make the Final Four of the Reaper Madness.
He saw his reflection.
Some people hide in plain sight.
Can’t say I knew him.
Any chance he cleared his appointment calendar?
Oh, crap! Does this mean we're gonna live forever?
So sudden. He hadn’t been sickle a day in his life.
Well, Ralph, it looks like we’re stuck here.
I couldn't stop for death, so he stopped for me. I guess I should've checked my speed going around that corner.
How unfortunate to be buried in ones only suit – makes Death look warmed over.
Now that's what I call a real Easter basket!
He fought the Reaper to a draw.
this is double dipping.
I wouldn't have recognized him without his scythe.
I heard he was sick!
This YOUR IDEA for dinner and a (K)NIGHT OUT ???
Id' say its the ultimate busman's holiday.
Sure he looks deader than dead, but I'm not falling for it.
I think we ought to put the scythe inside his robe. it does not look good the way it is.
If it wasn't open casket I wouldn't have believed it.
Groovy, I told you he was out of scythe
His spirit will live on in all of us, forever.
Bone cancer is just so tough to beat...
He met his match.
Looks better now than when He was doing those TV commercials.
"Just backpacking across flyover country".
I hope they find a replacement soon. Being here a moment longer than I have to scares the hell out of me.
fgsh
What do you mean someone buried you alive?
I don't think he's going to need that scythe any more.
Hey buddy, you know the rules: Ass, grass or jet fuel.
So the Angel of Death got his share.
Ugh. I know that guy.
He wanted to be sure to be ready to go to work right away -- such a workaholic!
I guess we are stuck together now.
Imagine - after all those years, he can still fit into his wedding shroud...
I think it's just a test drive
He was a nice boy, but self-indulgent.
He was always so last minute.
I wonder if we need a new Trade ?
It said G. Reper on his business card. I guess it was a typo.
They just don’t make caskets like they used to.
Really? Death Died -who's really in there?
Whoa. Meta.
He’s handsome, in a deathly way.
It's ironic, isn't it honey?
I'm not sure if it was wise to come to this viewing.
I heard he had a lot of inner fear
It was either him or me. He was in the wrong school at the wrong time.
Damn. What am I going to do about my nasty sister now?
He might welcome the new venue.
He's kind of like an Academy Award seat filler.
HE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK DEAD. HE JUST LOOK LIKE HE'S SLEEPING.
I have known him as long as I have known you
I'll kind of miss the old bigger.
R.I.P Reap in Peace
And you thought the mall parking lot was crowded already?
Busman's holiday.
I hear he didn't pay his taxes.
Finally, I don't have to have my coffee in the morning.
He's not nearly as scary as I thought he would be.
I always new your cousin George was a dead head.
Deadly!
"Fighting in the trenches" now has a whole new meaning.
Does Seth know the LARPing Party ended an hour ago?
Oh Death, there is your swing!
I didn't think Heaven would be so on the nose.
I was hoping he'd visit my sister.
His 'likes' are fantastic!
He does't look all that grim.
I don't care how "comfy" it feels.
He must have looked in a mirror
No rainbow bridge for him.
I’m not sure what it really means, but I’m Sure it can’t be good.
He died doing what he loved: KILLING THAT PUSS.
Her nose looks perfect.
Some people have no sense of what's appropriate!
He looks so natural... in a meta sort of way.
That's how I wanna go.
I believe he has now gone too far.
That escalated quickly.
I guess the grim reaper couldn’t wait for Harry’s burial.
To think he was following me around just yesterday.
Scythe-out!
Well, I heard Google was working on it.
Death be not proud!
He touched himself.
When Alice said she was preparing to meet death, I never imagined this!
If death is dead, does this mean we have to hang around forever?
I don't think he ever found a soulmate.
He said he could handle the graveyard shift.
Honey he had no chance against big pharma
Well! I always knew his was in bed with the Grim Reaper.
Well, no more cowbell.
The pallbearers are wearing chain-mail.
I told you you shouldn’t let our long-term care insurance expire.
It was the ultimate selfie.
He was depressed because the high tech phone and drone buzzing will replace the scythe.
Never thought I’d see the Grim Reaper in a casket!
Just as thought. It's your mother.
We've gotta go--Doc says I've got 'Irony-poor blood' and I can't be triggered.
On the contrary- I think you should fly higher.
At least he made us his beneficiary!
He couldn't take the pressure anymore,so he did himself in.
Well, Mabel, I give up. If he can't beat you...
He looks very grim in black, don’t you think?
They did such a great job with the face. He looks so lifelike and peaceful.
Looks like we're going to be around for a long time to come sweetie.
So this was what they meant by looking death in the eyes...
Well, that's what he gets! Hard to feel to sorry for him.
#Masturbation
He was cut for to many late deliverie
And to think that after all these years the man never wrinkled
This is so meta.
Nu, who's next?
He died like he lived -- in death.
And to think, this coffin was a sale price!
Sigh. Someday he'll realize to never challenge Gabriel to a tequila shot contest.
No wonder its so cold Theres no fire under our mattress
I hoped I could have looked that peaceful when my time would have come.
So what does this mean for us?
"We told them not to make him look lifelike." ["told" should be underscored]
Where's the hammer?
The poor man was impaled while trimming a pencil. He should have just used a sharpener.
Easter is REALLY early this year.
Looks like you can check Venice off your bucket list.
I don't understand. We named him "Graham."
He lost it when I refused to take his advice.
Self-indulgence will kill ya.
I admire his extreme dedication to customer empathy.
He’s always been dead set on defending that Best Costume title...
I'd like to help him, but, you know, three's a cloud.
Everything's a joke to him.
black robe... i'm reading the invitation, and it does not say black tie...
Let’s go Harry or we’ll be late for our 4 o’clock.
Happy Holiday, yutz.
You think if I took the sickle, anyone would notice?
Always planning ahead ...
His sense of humor had a dark side.
Open casket, but they covered the face
Everyone has a quota.
Well then, I suppose the chicken or the egg causality dilemma is now dead and buried.
I suppose it's the inevitable consequence of self-reflective knowing!
I hate to wake him. He seems so content.
it's either his homage to "death takes a holiday" , or "heaven can wait".
He cut himself shaving.
Herbert's most useful golf club was his scythe.
No one now can stop the bull markets.
What a beautiful wedding.
He donated to the wrong Time's Up
Whaddya know? We ARE witnessing the death of irony.
Time's up, even for him.
Most folks thought he’d never make it this long.
Lock the doors...
There's hope for us at last.
The formal term is "Insurrection," but the service was still very nice.
They say he was hit by a bus to Damascus.
"He wanted to know 'how the other half - dies'".
I always thought he’d be a farmer, never was.
His only sin was computer hacking RIP
I remember now: The tike died on Halloween.
He looks like he’s reaping
I guess Father Time finally ran out of time!
He looks tired.
I guess he figured there was no longer any point without gun control.
He did say we'd meet again.
He wasn't a big fan of John Donne.
Well, finally the chickens have come home to roost.
Well, as ye grimly sew....
I guess that means we have a few more years to live!
I used to ride with him before vaccination became common.
Now that death is dead, what the hell are we gonna do about Snooki?!
He never was a card carrier.
Do you think he got it wholesale ?
Well, the NRA finally did it- they worked Death to death.
Trading it for a winnowing fork has its downside.
I told it to build an App, now the biggest reaper service is provided by a software company with no spirits.
It's a trap!
He just didn't believe in himself.
I guess we better start looking for a new blameshift.
Oh, Harold, we did our best to give you a life of hope and happiness.
So now he has a chance to bring his beloved snow shovel with him.
And his favorite dessert was pop-sickles.
How can they close the cover?
No, he's just resting from the latest school shooting.
Way too much into his work!
Now that's what I call taking it with you!
Bloody waste, f you ask me.
He looks like himself
Close - but no cigar - Thats not him.
He told me years ago he had an identical twin brother.
Guess I should schedule that screening colonoscopy after all.
What in the hell did you do with our son? You took him over a week ago!
But...I don’t understand, Harry. Melvin never told us he had a second job. He looks so grim!
I heard they shelled out one helluva price for the casket!
They didn't even have an open bar.
- Dun Reapin', eh? - Where does that leave us?
He never did have a good sense of irony.
I don't see how life will go on without him.
His favorite band was Metadeth.
Howard, dear - I think we've finally found a reliable spiritual guide.
He was one giant Ja-wa!
I told you we didn't need more life insurance!
Putin is prepared for next world.
At least he went easy...He always was a dim sleeper.
No, it doesn't feature wi-fi.
Every death reminds you of all the other deaths
You scythe the song begins and I hear violins, it's magic!
He doesn't quite fit in here. Does he?
He died doing what he loved, farming.
I always thought he was just a carrier.
Decapitated head licking your cunt Sucking all the blood from your stump Intestinal guts taking their hold Leaving you dead, stiff and cold
I apologize for scaring you to death
Oh for peat sakes why did mr. death try to kill an desk!!!!!!ALLERT THE MEDIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Death comes to us all, I suppose.
Harold, we’re not just old, but *damn* old...
I never imagined he'd look so thin
So you didn't like my brother but he did help with the harvest
We pay for years of soul-harvesting school and now you say you just wanna be a Grim Sleeper??!!
Please get up. We need you to run against Diane Fienstein.
What!? You thought you 'd the lucky one!
I understand the costume is included in the "Grim Reaper Casket Special".
He looked so healthy when I saw him on the beach.
You reap what you sow." "That's true, but the lesson here is to never run in a cloak while carrying a scythe.
One last off-collar undertaking.
He was replaced by a robot.
His nasty backswing and tendency to slice took its toll.
I'd like to see his tax returns
I overheard them fighting and someone said "I'll kill you to death" not "I'll Kill you too, death!"
Whatsoever he soweth, he also reapeth.
Marge, does this mean we’re not going to die?
Funerals are so Grim.
God, I really loved that robe.
Does this mean we can cash our life insurance policies early?
Eh, Mabel. Looks like old G.R. has taken his last scythe.
We all do have our crosses to bear, but his was somehow, rather grim.
I think it’s selfie scythe!
I think Coco did him in.
Continued redundancy, sir, will close you down!
I'm so Happy he went before we did !
I knew your mother would win!
I guess it happens to all of us, but I would have removed it.
His expression is so natural....grim, per usual
I told him not to mess with me.
The ironic cruelty of cosplay.
I told you not to touch him, Harold, but you never listen.
Dead is God
I knew we should have sent him to sleep away camp
He looks so peaceful, doesn't he?
I love newborns.
He looks so peaceful, finally.
I am glad they decided to bury that crazy tool invention with him.
No matter how you scythe it, he's gone.
He wanted to be a doctor.
The implications of this are death defying.
It's still hard to believe -- just last week he was so full of life.
That is not dead which can eternal lie, and after strange aeons even death may die.
I wonder what this means for the rest of us.
Don’t get too close! It may be catching!
Call the Russians. Get our suite booked at the new ISS hotel.
The life of a business is customer relatability.
He pre-ordered the casket from Costco.
Let's not remember him for how he died, but for how he...
And stay away!
Oh my God! Is she going to live for good?
I don't think I can die without him.
Poor soul, he was clueless that I have a permit to carry.
Jeez, the death of Death. Hmm, bingo starts in 5 minutes.
He was always far too serious for his own good. Maybe now, he'll live a little.
He struggled against Death so valiantly, the American Death Association gave him its annual GRC (Grim Reaper Client) award!
See, nothing lasts forever.
You know, you're just a barrel of laughs.
Well, he's really dead.
It was a grim death.
He never changed.
Do you think it was that Thrones Game the kids mentioned where everyone dies?
I think he wanted to be cremated.
I heard he finally got filed his tax return.
Always so lifeless in his self, and so selfless in his life.
Oh phooey, guess we are stuck here
He doesn't look so grim now.
He finally gave up the ghost
I assumed, with clean Karma, we would never meet.
Well, this explains why we haven't heard from Ellen Muth in a while.
Next of kin? Good riddance actually!
This is the last time he lost his head.
So...I guess I should have topped up my So...I guess we’ll never get into that senior’s place now.
I wonder what they're paying? Doesn't look at all lifelike.
I told you he would never amount to any good.
Think it's fake news, Harold?
Who'da thunk it!
He should have donated to more charities, the poor guy.
She died playing "would you rather?"... this WAS her choice....
"Coffee break.
I guess you really must reap what you sew...
Who's now going to collect delinquent souls?
He killed himself with his own pipe smoking after he killed his wife with second hand smoke. Now they are together.
It's so like him to fight to the bitter end.
I told you Herbert that he'd never amount to anything.
Isn't it a bit gauche to show a suicide lying in repose?
Now do we live forever?
Trust me, Mildred. It's even more so for taxes.
He received posthumously "Best Costume" at the ball.
At least it's not me.
Some people will do anything to keep from having to go through the X-ray machine.
He's never looked better.
Has the Grip Reaper met his match?
We never should have let him watch video games!
Do you think we will miss him?
Death does not become him" "Is anything the same these days
Oh dear, must we live forever now?
He carried self-sufficiency to extremes.
A parent should never have to bury their reaper.
Guns are not allowed in hell. He wanted big protection for himself from bad dudes as he enters there.
Who's paying for this?
Aren't you double-dipping again?!
Heard these DIY burials are much cheaper!
So sad. Such a nice young man, he had his whole death ahead of him.

The operation went well—you’re one tough cookie.
We ran a few tests and all the toothpicks came back clean
In our opinion, you won't make it past the holidays.
Have you tried icing it?
I'm afraid the confection has spread.
It's not a ginger fracture. It's worse. It's a ginger snap.
I'm not going to sugarcoat this.
I'm afraid, sir, since you were on the floor for more than five seconds, there's nothing we can do for you.
He's only known to us as John Dough.
Good news: it's just a yeast infection.
The results of your biopsy were delicious.
We have good news and bad news: You'll be home for Christmas.
Eyes still look glazed.
You're fine, but they couldn't save the house.
I’m afraid that IS the way it crumbles, sir.
Time to meet your baker.
You’re lucky. They usually bite the head off first.
Your color is good, but your sugar level is high.
Were you battered as a child?
So the good news is we finally got your temperature down from 350 degrees.
Go home. Rest. Put some icing on it.
Have you tried icing it?
I'm here to take a tissue sample...actually, we'd all like samples.
Yes, thanks to a generous raisin donor, you can see again.
Good news. The Pillsbury Dough Boy is a match.
The fact that you survived the holidays is a good sign
We'd like to keep you here for further tasting.
Look, there's just no way to sugar-coat this...
You are a lucky man, considering that you had a temperature of 350 degrees for eight to ten minutes.
It's obviously gingervitis.
Unfortunately, all of our wheelchairs are in use. We do have a dessert cart.
I'm afraid he's going to die of consumption.
In case the surgery goes south, we're hoping that you consent to donating your body to the nurses break room.
The procedure will cost you an arm and a leg.
Prepare to meet your baker.
Sir, you are one tough cookie.
It's a miracle that you survived. Your house was totally devoured.
We're discharging you. I suggest that you run, run, as fast as you can.
Your cholesterol and sugar levels are a little high, but you color's good and you smell delicious.
Your sugar is too high, your fats are elevated, and , quite frankly, you’re a day too old.
The good news is we have a cure. The bad news is it'll cost you an arm and a leg.
Actually, you're right. Everyone does want a piece of you.
The patient won't tell us his name, so for the moment he's just John Dough.
And tomorrow when you wake up, you'll be a gingerbread woman.
We're here to serve you.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how crummy do you feel?
Welcome to the Culinary Care Unit.
This is the team that put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
We were wondering if we could take a few more samples.
Congratulations. You're now transginger.
"I'm sorry, did you just say bite me?".
You are one sick cookie.
It's a miracle you lasted through the holidays.
I'm not going to sugarcoat this.
You'll be able to walk again, but only gingerly.
Despite our best efforts, the confection is spreading.
You’d have the option to donate your body to science or to the bake sale.
They're here to take samples.
So. What's eating you?
On the bright side, none of us thought you'd make it through Christmas.
We've decided to keep you here for another 20 minutes at 350 degrees.
You are one tough cookie.
I've done all I can do. It's time to meet your baker.
We're moving you to the cafeteria.
We had to remove your raisins.
Good news: Your toothpick test came out clear.
You were running a temperature of 350°, but we brought it down with some icing.
We need to transfer you to the cafeteria.
He doesn't have Medicare or Medicaid, but he is covered by KitchenAid.
The good news is, you're out of the burn unit.
The whole procedure should take about an hour, at 350 degrees.
Not to worry—it's a convection oven, so you should be in and out in no time.
Apparently, these are the only specialists covered by your insurance.
Unfortunately, there's no way to sugarcoat this.
He was admitted under the name of “John Dough.”
There's a Do Not Reheat order.
We have found a donor and he's gluten free.
Fear of being eaten is normal for someone in your condition.
Insurance is not an issue here. He’s rolling in dough.
Your molasses is too low; your cinnamon is too high, and your clove is off the charts.
We have one question: “Do you know the muffin man?”
Your transginger procedure will involve adding gumdrops and removing your nutmeg.
It seems that you have a yeast infection from that pop tart you, um, picked up.
My colleagues suggest icing your leg.
We didn't think you'd make it past Christmas
Tell us how the hospital can best serve you.
I’ll say this…  you’re one tough cookie.
The patient is male, 10-12 minutes of age, presents with fever of 350 degrees, and is considered a flight risk.
Great news. Your biopsy was delicious.
We’re going to try icing it.
And if none of that works, try icing it
We’re going to keep you in for some tastes. I mean...tests.
We're going to move you down to the cafeteria.
You’re doing well considering that you were beaten and battered.
Unfortunately what you have may lead to consumption.
Would you like to donate your body to the Girl Scouts?
Just a few degrees more and he would've been toast.
We'll need some samples
We're surprised you lasted through the holidays.
We'll know more after the taste test.
It will be a one time procedure for 12 minutes at 350 degrees.
The patient will be referred to as John Dough
Another 15 minutes at 350 and you'll be up and running again.
Good news! We found a donor, it'll be a piece of cake!
Bad news. You're going to make it home for Christmas.
Your surgery will take 10 to 12 minutes at 350 degrees.
Good news. Tests indicate that you are not paranoid. Everyone DOES want a piece you.
He came in with a temperature of 350°.
I won't sugarcoat it, we're looking at a massive confection.
I'm afraid you only have until Christmas.
We've identified the problem; you're half-baked
We believe you have an Edible Complex.
The good news is that it is just a yeast infection.
You're done.
You have until Christmas.
What on Earth makes you think we practice cookie-cutter medicine?
With your insurance, the procedure would cost you an arm and a leg.
My colleagues recommend icing to bring down the fever.
It was touch and go there, for a while, but it turns out you're one tough cookie.
I'm afraid there's no way to sugarcoat this.
Lastly, do you know the muffin man?
You'll be fine but your house is a total loss.
"Gender" reassignment? We thought you said "ginger".
This time tomorrow, you'll be the Gingerbread Woman!
We believe you are suffering from a yeast infection.
You have 350 degree burns all over your body.
We can fix you up, but it'll take a lot of dough.
They tell me another 5 minutes at 350 and you’ll be ready to go home
You've got gingervitis.
If you don't make it through surgery, would you be willing to donate your body to a kid's birthday party in Brooklyn?
I'm afraid our first diagnosis was half-baked.
We found a potential donor and ran some tests. Unfortunately, he was delicious.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but everyone wants another biopsy.
What seems to be eating you?
I’d like you to meet your makers.
You are going to be OK, but the first responders ate your house.
How long have you felt that the spice has gone out of your life?
You'll be discharged at noon but only if the results of your toothpick test comes back clean.
Could you show us exactly where you were bitten?
We're just trying to determine what's eating you.
This is the worst case of gingervitis I have ever seen
I’m afraid the stiffness will only get worse.
Don't worry, we won't bite.
Sore knee, huh...did you try icing it?
You can get a second opinion, but we think 15 minutes at 350 degrees was the right call.
We recommend complete bed rest and another 10 minutes at 350 degrees.
I've brought in a team of specialists to run some tastes.
You want to show us where you were bitten
Good news. Turns out you don't even have a prostate.
They'll have you flat on your back again in no time at all.
Don't worry, we're baking you a new one.
Well, yes - you are half-baked.
The specialists agree with me. You're done.
So far, we have been able to fight off consumption.
It's time to meet your makers
So, can you show us where she bit you.
Your sugar level is off the charts
The doctors here can't figure out what's wrong with you so we've brought in some specialists.
The biggest risk with the dunk procedure, of course, is loss of limb.
We couldn't save the house.
Your test results are back. All inserted toothpicks came out clean.
We all agree that there's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple yeast infection.
Don't focus on their hats -- these people are here to serve you.
I'm sorry to inform you that your sugar level is dangerously high.
A classic case of gingervitis.
Just a teaspoon of baking powder and it will rise again
We’ll have you up and eaten in no time.
Welcome to Cook County Hospital.
As slow as you're moving, they feel it has to be the molasses.
Don't worry: Nobody's gonna bite your head off.
Well Mr. Ginger, you say you heard something snap?
We're moving you to the cafeteria.
The test results are in, your sugar levels are way too high.
After you ran as fast as you could, what happened?
After the surgery, you'll walk with a candy cane.
You are one tough cookie.
We'll have you up and edible in no time.
Results are in, you have gingervitis.
Have you decided whether you'd prefer to pay with an arm or a leg?
The bad news: we have to amputate. The good news: coffee's brewing.
He's complaining of joint pain and says that icing doesn't help.
What we have here is one sick cookie!
Well, there's no sugar coating this...
I'm afraid I can't sugar coat this...
I'm afraid it's a yeast infection.
Bad news. It's gingervitis.
You've got two weeks left. Maybe four, if we freeze you.
Your tests results are in and you need 15 more minutes at 350.
We've determined that you have a yeast infection.
We're trying to find a donor made from the same recipe.
Don't worry. It's just a simple yeast infection.
You know you're going to have to inform all your previous partners. Do you know the Muffin Man?
I'll tell you what: you're one tough cookie.
You have a yeast infection.
We are pleased to report that your gumdrops came back benign.
I know what you mean. I feel like everyone wants a piece of me too.
We’ll treat your condition as gingerly as possible.
In your condition, we'll have to treat you gingerly.
I don't think he'll make it past the holidays.
My colleagues and I are debating how best to serve you.
We’ve ruled out a yeast infection.
Still feeling crummy?
Fortunately, no one can catch it. You're the gingerbread man.
Good news. Your insurance covers frosting.
Your blood sugar is through the roof.
Don't worry, we won't bite.
We're amazed you made it through the holidays.
There's no way to sugar coat this...
Prepare to meet your baker.
Now, about your house...
Your sugar is high.
The good news is you're fine. The bad news is these aren't doctors.
Tests confirm a severe case of gingervitis.
Exactly at what time and temperature did you wake up to that burning sensation?
We had to take a raisin, but we saved all your frosting.
We don't mind the term "cookie cutter", but we prefer "confectionery surgeon".
He came in complaining of 'feeling crumby'."
The lab results are back, and you're going to be okay. You are one tough cookie.
Your test results came back. Unfortunately, they're delicious.
We think it's a yeast infection.
You're feeling crumby. Could you be more specific?
Don’t worry, we’ll have you running away fast as you can in no time.
The good and bad news is that we've upgraded your status to "delicious".
We have bad news, you tested positive for gluten.
Well, I'm not gonna sugar-coat it...
It’s normal to feel warm for a while.
I'm afraid he's not going to make it past Christmas.
More tastes – I mean tests – are necessary.
I'm afraid the surgery will cost an arm and a leg.
He has that glazed over look.
This procedure may cost you an arm and a leg.
Bad news, I'm afraid. Prepare to meet your Bakers.
Don't worry, it's a straightforward cookie cutter procedure.
I'm afraid fixing you up is going to take a lot of dough.
I'm afraid it's going to be, "Walk, walk, as fast as you can," from now on, Mr. Gingerbread Man.
We’re going to need to take a biopsy. And depending how it tastes, we may need to amputate.
When did you notice the burning feeling?
Can you be more specific about feeling "half baked"?
The operation was a complete success: you are now gluten-free!
For the second opinion your requested, I've brought in experts from Pillsbury, Pepperidge Farm and Betty Crocker.
His hope is to avoid consumption.
There's no easy way to put this, at best you're looking at a 1-2 week shelf life. Maybe 3 if we use preservatives.
It seems he has a bad case of gingervitis.
I'm afraid to tell you it's time to meet your makers.
The results were fine, but we're concerned about your sugar.
And as for exercise, I recommend you run, run as fast as you can.
Just keep icing it and you’ll be fine
We're just going to run a few taste tests.
You'll need a combination of rest and icing.
We're sorry but it doesn't look like you'll make it past Christmas.
You'll need to walk gingerly at first.
Your temperature's 350. You're free to go.
The Lab tests indicate a yeast infection
Just as we feared: You're half-baked.
No worries, it's just a yeast infection.
He's one sick cookie
Frankly, I'm stumped, so I've brought in some specialists.
We are happy to report you are now gluten free.
Your sugar levels are off the charts.
I'm afraid it's time to meet your makers.
The team agrees. It's gingervitis.
The police think this attack might have been personal, Mr. Ginger....Do you know the muffin man?
I'm afraid it's time to meet your makers.
We successfully gave you some nuts.
I don't know how to tell you this, but your stool samples...were delicious!
We can help, but without insurance, it will cost you an arm and a leg.
We recommend icing.
So tell us, what's eating you?
We checked with ancestry.com and you're only 5% ginger.
So you say you’ve been feeling crumby all week?
You’re not paranoid. Everyone really is out to eat you.
The good news is, the operation was a success. The bad news is, we're hungry.
It's a simple operation that lasts only twenty-five minutes at 325 degrees.
Your sugar levels are too high.
Remember us, we worked on your house?
My colleagues all agree: You're done.
I've brought some experts in to discuss your sugar levels.
Now this is one tough cookie
Your blood sugar's a little high.
It seems you will no longer be able to run, run, as fast as you can.
I don't know what you've been up to lately, but your nutmeg levels are off the charts again.
So you say you had a fever of 375 degrees?
They are here to serve you.
We think you'll be better with a glass of milk.
The "operation" was a success. You are now a transginger.
Frankly, I was hoping this case would be a piece of cake.
I brought in a team of specialists, your confection seems to be spreading.
The treatment worked really well for Fruit Cake. He lasted forever.
We must admit, we didn't think you'd make it past December
I think we can rule out low blood sugar.
So do high sugar levels run in your family?
And here we have a classic case of extreme Gingervitis
We're gonna have to cut out your nuts.
The good news is you’re still edible.
I'm sorry, we had no choice but to remove your jelly bean.
Strangely, butter seems to make you better.
You were in cardamom arrest.
They want me to release you before dinner.
High sugar and cholesterol, burns over half of his body, survived a fox attack. That’s one tough cookie.
Surgery is out of the question, so we're going to dunk you in milk until something falls off.
We recommend icing.
Don't worry. The operation will be a piece of cake.
You're in good hands. They put Humpty Dumpty together again.
Fortunately, your condition is not serious. We recommend icing.
It will be an honor to serve you.
Cookie. Age indeterminate. Morbid gingervitis with with early onset crumbling. Runaway fantasies.
I don't want any more of your half-baked opinions.
Well, to start, your sugar levels are a touch high.
Amazing! No one thought he’d make it past the holidays.
Unfortunately, we can't use the cookie cutter approach this time.
I think you have gingervitis.
I tend to agree with them that you're half-baked.
After the surgery her name will be Ginger.
Our initial medical evaluation indicates the first known case of a male being made of sugar and spice and everything nice.
Still low sugar, but your ginger levels look fine.
He's going to make it, he's a tough cookie.
We've called in the specialists. We'll start your tasting, uh, I mean testing, this afternoon.
The amputation is scheduled for 15 minutes prior to coffee break.
My team here all agree that the best thing for that elbow is a little icing.
The lab results are in, and you're delicious.
Looks like a bad case of gingervitis.
The biopsy came back delicious.
We heard you're feeling crummy.
Don't worry, no one wants to bite your head off.
This is an experimental treatment; so far we've only tried it on snickerdoodles.
The good news is, you're healthy. The bad news is, you're delicious.
You were almost toast, but you're one tough cookie.
However, should the unforeseen occur, would you consider donating your body to the cafeteria?
The good news is your tumors are raisins.
The sample came back delicious and we'd like to run a few more tests.
Treat him gingerly.
It appears you're half baked.
We were able to save your leg, but you'll want to stay away from milk for at least two weeks.
our next patient has had a temperature of 350 for about 20 minutes
Your sugar's a little too high.
The operation was a success! You are now gluten-free!
He was found half baked.
Unfortunately your HMO will only pay for 1/4 tsp of sugar.
It's your knees. They want to try icing them.
The main thing is to avoid being eaten at least four hours before surgery.
In your case, it will literally cost an arm and a leg.
We're just here to take some samples.
The patient complained that he was experiencing temperatures of 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
We cant give you a new heart, but we can give you sprinkles.
We recommend that you run, run just as fast as you can.
I'm happy to report that your gumdrops are entirely benign.
... and your glucose levels are off the chart.
A transplant is available, but it's from a Graham cracker.
Treat him gingerly.
I'd like to introduce you to the team here in the Burn Unit.
Good news! You’re gluten-free. Bad news. You’re still delicious.
He arrived half-baked.
The first thing we need to do is take a sample.
We'd like you to cut back on your sugar, but add a touch of cinnamon.
Hmm, how do I put this gingerly?
It's the worst case of gingervitus we've seen.
I'm sorry son, but the prognosis is grim. I'm afraid... it's time to meet your makers.
The earlier tests were inconclusive, so we're going to need seconds.
He'll have a large scar, but that can be covered with icing.
Got milk? Just kidding!
They're here to grease your bedpan.
I need to break this to you gingerly.
Would it put your mind at ease if I said they're medical students?
You may be walking gingerly the next couple of days.
Well, your test results are back, and I'm happy to say you're gluten free.
We’re going to need a large glass of milk, stat!
Do you know the muffin man ?
Don't worry. We'll have you up and running in no time.
Good news, sir...you're done.
"I'm sorry sir. You won't make it past Christmas." -Stella Panarelli, age 10
Nothing to worry about, just a routine taste test.
You’ll be happy to know your biopsy got rave reviews.
You're now a gingerbread woman. We hope you're happy.
Your expiration date was two months ago. Your health insurance company has declined your claim.
I’m afraid milk’s set in — we can’t save the leg.
Sir, it's time for you to meet your makers.
Turns out, it was just a yeast infection.
The surgery will cost you an arm and a leg.
Your glucose is off the chart.
Looking on the bright side, you outlived the sell by date.
Unfortunately, the insurance only covered 5 minutes in the oven.
We'll be moving you to a lightly floured surface.
We’ll need more than “I feel crumby.”
Don't worry. The procedure is a snap.
We’ve got to treat him gingerly.
when I suggested ginger he just snapped
He made it out safely, but unfortunately we were unable to save the house.
He’s not contagious - you can’t catch the gingerbread man.
The bad news is...we're hungry.
Seems to be a yeast infection.
We'll need to take some samples.
The bad news is that your sugar and cholesterol levels are very high. The good news is you are well done.
We brought milk. You won't feel a thing.
They say you're one tough cookie.
We are concerned that your sugar levcl is very high..
So, are you still feeling crummy?
He is a tough cookie. He will be fine.
Our team has determined you have acute gingervitis.
The good news is that you're delicious.
It looks like gumdrop enlargements would not be covered by your insurance.
My team's most recent success was freeing four-and-twenty blackbirds that were somehow baked in a pie.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but the icing appears to have spread.
I called in some leading spatulists.
The kitchen staff will prepare you for the operation
Thank you for donating your body to culinary science.
The good news is you'll still technically be able to run as fast you can.
Are you ready to meet your makers?
The entire team wants to apologize for forgetting your nose
I am sorry. Your expiration date is Tuesday. There is nothing we can do.
He says he always felt like a gingerbreadwoman.
You’ll be ready to go home, once my colleagues bake you a house.
They were wondering if you'd like them to bake you some visitors.
You’ll have to move ginger...ah...carefully until the stitches come out.
We've narrowed it down to a few different spices.
You are ready to go home, but unfortunately we ate it.
We did not expect you to rise.
Well, we’re split - two say you’re underdone, two say you’re overdone, and one just wants to see if you have a penis.
Your sugar is a bit high but otherwise you're fine.
The problem is your circulation -- it's as slow as molasses.
We're going to proceed gingerly.
It appears all your running has finally caught up with you.
And we recommend icing to keep down the inflammation.
Have you considered donating your body to the hospital cafeteria?
I'm afraid we could't stop the spread of confection.
Sorry, your insurance doesn't cover frosting.
We're here to serve you.
Ten minutes at 350 degrees and he'll be fine.
So you say you’re feeling crummy?
Our specialists have determined you have a yeast infection.
I'm sorry, sir, there's only one person who can perform your surgery. He lives on Drury Lane, up in Mulberry County. Do you know him? Do you know the muffin man?
I'm afraid your sugars are low.
The bad news is you're going to be delicious.
They say you weren't cut out for this.
We've decided to do a few taste tests.
You'll snap out of it.
It's a sraightfoward gender reassignment. We simply scrape off the blue icing and apply the pink.
Good news. The re-assignment baking was successful. You are now officially a Ginger Bread Man.
Bed rest and icing should help.
I won't be performing the transplant myself, but my staff here assures me it's a piece of cake.
You’re lucky to be in one piece.
Relax, they need just a couple of samples.
We're just going to hold you overnight for tasting.
The good news is you're fine. The bad news is you're delicious.
We'll know more after the taste test.
Contrary to my original diagnosis, my colleagues feel more sugar and butter would actually be good for you.
Yeast infection.
the team concurs that you're one sick cookie
You have nothing to worry about; our surgeons are all Zagat rated.
"He was found floating in a glass of milk.
We're sorry to inform you that you're only half baked.
I was afraid he wouldn't make it,but he's one tough cookie
We need to handle this one gingerly.
Well sir, it appears your diagnosis is 'too many cooks'.
You’ve been in a sugar induced coma for the last eight days.
We think if we give him 50cc of baking powder we can get him to rise up.
There's a lot to digest here.
He has gingervitis.
Your taste test came back positive.
We're going to have to run a few more taste tests.
It's serious, but don't worry folks, he's one tough cookie.
In this case you apply heat first, then you ice it.
We'll run those tests as fast as we can.
A nurse will be in shortly to transfer you to a plate.
Looking better today. You were half baked yesterday
The surgery will cost you an arm and a leg.
Looks like a bad case of gingervitis.
We think you'll find that a microwave is no more invasive than an x-ray.
The procedure should only take an hour but we'll have to flip you over half way through.
Looks like a yeast infection.
Good news. We found an icing donor.
Call me if you have a confection lasting over four hours.
After much deliberation, we have decided to call your condition "Gingervitis"".
I'm sorry, but you have a terminal yeast infection.
While the knee operation was a success, you'll have to use a candy cane.
Do you remember what you were doing when you snapped?
All he remembers is running as fast as he could.
Can you tell us what ingredients you've been taking?
Can you tell us your sell by date?
He's been feeling crummy.
The good news is you're not going to be a vegetable for the rest of your life.
Your sugar is off the charts.
You are in Cook County Hospital.
'Traces of nuts' should be the least of your concerns.
The bad news is they couldn't save your house.
Your road to recovery will be a snap.
Bad news. The INS is here. You're being sent back to Candyland.
The results are in. I'm afraid you have an Edible Complex.
The tests are in and I'm sorry. You're delicious.
Of course you can donate your body to science, but have you considered our cafeteria?
We must approach this gingerly.
We're all here to serve you.
Your blood sugar levels are troubling.
You should prepare to meet your baker.
It's just as we suspected, you're half baked.
Treatment will be over in a snap.
They're rebuilding your house as we speak.
It was a success, but your recovery will be slow as molasses.
I brought in some specialists.
My work is done here. The cafeteria staff will take over from here.
I'm sorry, but today is your expiration date.
Sorry, but your friends didn’t make it past Christmas.
It could be a yeast infection.
Christmas is over. You can stop faking now.
I’m afraid that you have a yeast infection.
Our recommendation is to stay away from milk.
We’re going to do some testing to see if you’re done.
His brown edges look normal. We'll let him cool here for 30 minutes before we release him to an air-tight container. He should be fine for up to five days.
I think you'll agree we don't need to sugarcoat this diagnosis.
We need to run a few taste tests.
This is what your policy covers for a pre-existing confection.
What are you talking about? Of course they're doctors, they're wearing white coats.
We're just here to take some samples.
I suggest that we try icing it
I see dozens of these cases.
Your levels of fat and sugar are high, and that's where we want them to stay.
The good news is that the operation went well. The bad news is that we ate your house.
Your blood pressure and cholesterol are fine. It's your sugar we're worried about.
I'm afraid your prognosis is Grimm.
I’m afraid you have high blood sugar.
The good news is that your family made it out of the oven just in time.
Get me 300cc of milk, stat.
This is the team that also worked on Humpty Dumpty.
It's time to meet your makers
Obviously we'll need to chew on this one for awhile.
His temperature is right at 350 degrees.
We believe the problem is a yeast infection.
We need to speak with you about your expiration date.
We are recommending a cardiac stress test. You'll have to run, run, run as fast as you can.
In my professional opinion. Run run as fast as you can.
I'd like you to meet our team of specialists. They're from the cafeteria.
I'll give it to you straight, it's a yeast infection.
We think your sugar a little high.
After reviewing your recipe, we've concluded you have a yeast infection.
I think we can just scrape off the burned parts.
Obviously you didn't run fast enough.
Let's see what we can do about getting that temperature down from 375 degrees.
It isn't every day we can eat our mistakes.
Great news! You will make a full recovery. Unfortunately the house was entirely devoured.
The good news is you're not diabetic. The bad news is neither are we.
The patient is complaining of feeling crumby
Great news! We have a donor. He’s a ginger snap, but it’s a match.
His temperature's down. For 10 minutes he was at 350°.
I'm afraid you're suffering from Seasonal Confection Disorder.
Considering his initial temperature was 350 degrees, I think he looks quite well.
Congratulations, it's a madeleine.
Your test results came back. Your sugar levels are extremely high.
Only he survived, the others were burnt to a crisp!
Our diagnosis is that you're half-baked.
Vital signs are good, but he's looking a little pastry.

Ginger has significant health benefits but you might want to cut back on the butter and brown sugar.
Any food allergies?
I'm sorry, sir, but without treatment, the icing will spread.
Patient describes having acute fear of being eaten.
If he bends in the middle like that, he's not done.
Our team of bakers agrees you are fortunate to have survived the holidays with all your body parts intact.
Sorry, we think you're done.
Anesthetist? No, we're waiting for the milk man.
Unfortunately, there is no cookie-cutter treatment available.
Physical exam complete. Let's move on to the taste test.
The good news is, it’s not a break. You’ve just crumbled.
I'm afraid it's Gingervitis
We felt sure you'd crumble, but it turns out you are one tough cookie.
Unless you cough up some dough, we can't treat you.
You'll be okay but, I'm sorry, your house didn't make it.
So let me get this straight. You ran away from a little old woman, a little old man, a cow and a horse and it was after that when you felt the chest pain?
Your new heart is ready, we're just waiting for it to cool.
And one last question. Do you know the Muffin Man?

Ginger Bed Man
We're going to need to run a few more taste tests.
... And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the cookie crumbles.

Your parents are here to see you.

As of today, you're gluten free.
How about a coffee with us?
Bring us six glasses of milk—STAT!
We're baffled -- we followed package directions to the letter.
We couldn't get a perfect match, so we gave you a kidney from an animal cracker.
You were the only survivor, all the others crumbled.
I know this may be hard to hear, sir... but all of us have to one day meet our baker.
The good news is, you survived the holidays.
when you were admitted you were running a temperature of 350 degrees
He appears to be half baked.
I'm afraid it's time for you to meet your makers.
The good news is, you're delicious.
It says here your emergency contact is a Mister... Muffin Man?
He's toast.
There’s no way to sugarcoat this, it’s time to meet your makers.
I always start with the head.
We’re confident we got it all. You’re gluten-free.
He wants to be a ginger bread woman.
It's not serious. Just needs icing.
Your blood pressure is fine, but your molasses is through the roof.
We have a theory as to what's wrong but it's not fully baked yet.
He requested that his remains be taken with milk.
A 500 ml molasses drip and a weeks worth of tetracycline should bring him around, then we bake him at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
The diagnosis is Gingervitis.
We only amputate when it's absolutely delicious...er, I mean necessary.
They've come to apologize for the first degree burns.
You’re going to have to cough up more dough if you want the procedure.
Tell us what happened after the oven door closed.

What other symptoms do you have besides feeling crummy?
Does anyone recognize John Dough?
We believe the raisins can be safely removed.
It's seasonal
You have 3 weeks to live, or until the staff holiday party, whichever comes first.
Well....from the looks of him this should be a snap.
We did the best we could, considering what we had to work with. You might want to stay away from milk.
They forgot to set the timer. We had to admit you to the burn unit.
Stop complaining; we didn't give you fingers either.
He's well enough to eat.
His temperature last night was 325 degrees
You'll run again but never as fast as you can.
The consensus is: you're done.
Your lab results are a recipe for disaster.

We can fix it, but it will take a lot of dough.
It's probably nothing, but we won't know for sure until we break off your arm and eat it.
A little confectioners sugar and food coloring, and you’ll be a new man.
He's also presenting as soft and chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Anyone?
I'm afraid we'll have to remove your gluten.
We can rule out a yeast infection.
Order an anti-depressant, he says all the spice is gone from his life.

Good news. The test results are back and you are completely gluten free.
We’ve brought in a team of specialists to flip you over to see if you’re done.
They're here to take samples.
This is one of those rare moments when being one tough cookie is actually a good thing.
Have you had any thoughts about donating your body for dessert?
Do you want to be rescessitated if you start to crumble?

The girl scouts send their best wishes.
At least he's not as nutty as that fruitcake in the other bed.
I'm afraid your prognosis is Grimm.
We are sorry Mr. Man but the days of running just as fast as you can are over.
I want you to meet your surgical team.
Your temperature was 350.
He seems to be crumbling.
Remember, when you are discharged you will need to sit on the counter and cool for 15 mins.
So you say you’re feeling crummy?
Was any part of your home produced in a facility that also handles wheat, milk, nuts, eggs, or soy?
We’re recommending icing it.
Whatever this is, he's convinced we can't catch it.
They're concerned that your sugar's too high.
As you can see, he's suffering from a severe case of gingervitis.
I keep dreaming that I'm being eaten alive.
Your prognosis is dim, but...that's the way the cookie crumbles.
His blood sugar level is off the charts, but he is one tough cookie.
So. What's eating you?
...and this patient was the victim of a half-baked scheme

Good news. We've found a donor with your icing type.
I hope you have your affairs in order, Mr. Mann. It's time to meet your baker.
You are now a gingerbread woman

Can we get you some milk??
The good news is we were able to reattach your left leg. The bad news is you are now part pumpernickel.
The team feels it’s your sugar level.
I can take the news Doc. No need to sugar coat it.
It looks like a terminal case of gingervitis.
Your formerly conjoined twin is also doing well.
You won’t feel a thing once the milk arrives.
Don't worry - we'll handle you very gingerly, man.
Would you mind showing us where you were dunked?
We have found a donor, but it turns out to be a house.
No more running as fast as you can
Your biopsy results indicate that you’re delicious.
We're trying to determine what caused your low sugar levels.
We think it's gingervitis
First-degree burn. Cookie-cutter case.
Examine him gingerly, he may snap.
Maybe gluten-free wasn't such a good idea.
We wish the news was better, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.
No, they are not from the lab, but they still would like a sample.
He was admitted with a temperature of 450 degrees.
He suffered frosting bite on his lower extremities.
We used some extra strength frosting and were able to reattach it.
We won't know for sure until the taste tests are finished.
The good news is, you're not a vegetable.
The consensus is that, although you may think you are a tough cookie, you are merely half-baked.
We hear you're feeling pretty crummy.
We think it's gingervitis
We have decided to treat you gingerly.
The results are in: You're positively scrumptious.

I'm recommending a culinary bypass.
On the bright side, your burns may keep you from being eaten.
It seems he can't rise.
Actually in this case a temperature of 350° is perfectly normal.
Your candy heart transplant will be much cheaper after February 14.
And you say no one has shown you a mirror since your procedure?
I'm afraid it's seasonal.
We only need a small crumb sample.
the bad news is your glucose level is off the chart.
My colleagues and I think it's a very aggressive form of Gingervitis.
You'll be up running as fast as you can in no time
You're done.
Unfortunately, "surgery" was autcorrected to "sugary."
You look like you haven't been eaten in weeks.
Looks like gingervitis caught you.
We've consulted with each other but are reluctant to give you a cookie-cutter diagnosis.
They advise icing the fracture
We've applied heat, now it's time for icing.
Let me introduce Doctors Baker, Baker, Baker, Baker and Baker.

Unfortunately, the only transplant we have available is from an animal cracker.
Sir, it seems you have a severe case of gingervitis.
I'm putting you on complete bread rest.
This is my preliminary assessment, but I'm fairly certain that leaping from the oven was a contributing factor.
...and finally for the hair transplant, you've got two options: Sprinkles or strawberry laces?
If you like your baker, you can keep your baker.
Your temperature had spiked rather high for a while sir, but now that you've cooled down to room temperature, you're good to go.
This is not just some cookie cutter operation.
On the bright side, you're a cookie now
I think we’ve found the appropriate specialists for your condition.
For your transition to Chocolate Chip, we've called in these specialists in cosmetic bakery.
Now don't bite my head off, but these experts think your sugar level is too high.

You have a life expectancy of December
Our tests show you feel flat due to a lack of sodium bicarbonate.
They're not interested in your symptoms, just your ingredients.
You are about to meet your maker.
We can operate, but we'll need more dough

We're worried about your sugar levels.
We can't find anything wrong with you. In fact, you're delicious!
Would you like to donate your organs to lunch - I mean science?
We advise that you don't run as fast as you can.
To tell you the truth, I don't know how you lasted this long.
No, Sir, I’m afraid the Muffin Man is still unaccounted for.
Good news, they've come up with an ingredient to extend your expiration date.
The bakers have said all you really need is 20 minutes at 325 and you'll be fine.
We're going to try another 12 minutes at 375.
Sorry, but it looks like you only have until Christmas to live.
Since you're uninsured, treatment is going to cost you an arm and a leg.
Looks like a yeast infection.
Here we have a John Dough. He can't remember who he is but was found running away from the White House.
I hope you set aside some dough.
Surprisingly it's not a yeast infection.
And remember, no more run, run, as fast as you can for the next 10 to 12 weeks.
His temperature is well over 350 degrees
So you ran away fast. Is that the last thing you remember?
I don't want you to run, run as fast as you can for at least a month.
Your sugar is way too high.

We're going to handle your case gingerly.
We're just waiting for your temperature to come down.
...and I’d suggest you stay away from milk...
I knew he would pull through He's a tough cookie
They all agree: you’re half-baked.
Are these the "too many cooks" you were referring to?
Looks like sore feet. Have you tried icing them?
The test results are back— we may need to do some sugar coating.
Sorry to break the bad news, but you can no longer run as fast as you can!
I believe that your days of running, running as fast as you can have finally caught up with you.
No, you can't catch it. He's the gingerbread man.
This will cost you an arm and a leg.
We operate gingerly.

Chances are good that you'll be eaten before it becomes a problem.

Fortunately for you, these folks scraped together enough dough to get you well again.
The doctor will eat you now.
I'd like you to meet the transplant team.
It's a standard procedure sir. Totally cookie-cutter.
Never, ever run, run as fast as you can again.
The good news is you're perfectly fine. The bad news is that it's lunch.
Your test results indicate that you suffer from hypoglycemia, too much gluten, and your cholesterol levels are off the chart. I'm afraid there is nothing I can do, however, my colleagues think you're an excellent candidate for their program.
You still have a bit of a fever, but you smell delicious.
He's made a remarkable recovery. We thought he was toast.
Your blood-sugar level is off the charts.

We're sorry---you're half-baked.
Your ginger reassignment surgery was a success.

After 10 minutes at 350 degrees, you're going to feel like a new man.

I'm afraid your sugar levels are dangerously high
I'm afraid you have until Christmas.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a case of extreme gingervitis.

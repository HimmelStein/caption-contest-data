Do you want to go for L-U-N-C-H and maybe a W-A-L-K?
They're quiet now, but wait until the mail is delivered.
I got a "You're a good girl. Yes you are" on my performance review.
All I did was pat him on the head and now he's reporting me to HR.
Once you tell them to sit and stay, they actually get a lot of work done.
I've only worked here one year, but it feels like seven.
Well I think I know why all the office plants are dying.
Stan was fired...he attacked the FedEx guy again.
All my evaluation said was "Good girl."
Don't say anything but I'm going for a w-a-l-k at lunchtime.
If you think it noisy now now, wait until the mailman comes by.
You should have been here last week when someone rang the doorbell!
Do you want to go for a W-A-L-K?
Well I’m leaving at five, even if the boss says, "Stay.
Want to go for a W-A-L-K?
It's 2019 Jim, you can't just rub your coworker's belly and not expect an email from HR.
I need to get out of the office for a bit. Wanna go for a W-A-L-K with me?
The glass ceiling was bad enough but having to deal with invisible fencing is outrageous.
Fine. You’re a good boy too.
It's like...whose butt do I have to sniff to get a promotion around here?
Okay, you open the window and I'll throw the ball.
Wanna go for a w-a-l-k?
I need some fresh air. Do you want to take a W-A-L-K?
All I’m saying is that if they can operate a computer they should be able to pick up their own damn poop.
You want to yell “Squirrel,” or can I?
Want to go for a 'W-A-L-K' at lunch?
I've seen his browsing history. He's not such a good boy.
They're extremely smart, but watch where you step.
Got a "good girl" on my review, so yeah I'm happy.
Yes, you're a good boy, too.
Every year here feels like seven.
I can not believe he asked me to walk him home
Management wants me to roll over, and I just won't do it.
OK, fine, yes, you're a "good boy" too.
Don't be so fragile.
You wanna get out of here?  Maybe take a w-a-l-k?
I could use a break. Do you wanna go for a W-A-L-K?
Down the hall, second hydrant on your left.
Yeah, for now. Watch what happens when the UPS guy shows up.
I don't think you have a clue what it's like for me, being the only woman in this office.
Whose belly do I have to rub to get the password?
It's nice and quiet until the UPS truck pulls up.
No Jack, I don't think yelling "squirrel" will be funny.
I’d work hard too if I could retire at age 10.
I don’t know. Why don’t you ask that bitch sitting next to you?
The boss rewards loyalty.
Be nice to Gary, he just got neutered yesterday.
I can get used to everything but the drinking out of the toilet.
They only have one year of experience. Well,technically seven.
I said, do you want to go for a W-A-L-K with me at lunch.
Our technical support guy went out on break, got distracted by a squirrel, and never came back.
Every minute seems like seven here.
How am I the office bitch?
Whatever you do, DO NOT use the squirrel emoji.
Whose butt do you have to sniff to get a set of headphones around here?
What are the policies regarding petting?
Fine, I was wrong. Maybe they can be taught some new things.
Every year I work here  feels like seven!
I'm going for a W.A.L.K. on break.
Come ON, Brian. The log-in is 'who's a good boy?' Just write it DOWN!
Whose butt do we have to sniff to get ahead in this company?
Somehow I'm still the lowest paid person here.
No—it’s YOUR turn to walk the new guy.
I miss the days when they just played poker.
I refuse to roll over to get a promotion.
They might leave if you hit the pound key.
It's not so much their work ethic, but their constant need to be praised.
Am I the only one who can never hear the lunch whistle?
And we keep getting hacked because everyone’s password is “squirrel”.
Should I report the inappropriate sniffing to HR?
'Don't let them know we're going for a w-a-l-k later.'
They’re loyal, they’re obedient, they work for scraps... who wouldn’t be worried about job security?
Would it kill them to hire one cat?
They're computer Labs.
I legally changed my name to Fluffy. How did YOU get hired?
I’m putting in for a transfer.  Every time his girlfriend calls his tail starts hitting me.
I told Rex to fetch me a spoon, and now I have to meet with HR.
You can use the one downstairs, but the hydrant is just for executives.
How did you answer the question "Who's a good boy?"
He may be a good boy, but he’s a bad boss.
I still only make 79 cents on the dollar, but if I say anything then I’M the bitch…
I don't care if it is part of the company culture. The next time I get rubbed behind the ears, I'm walking.
Yes, of course you're a good boy too.
Don’t ask me. They all  have top secret clearances from the White House.
You wanna go for a W-A-L-K?
Just be glad its not hump day!
If I get sniffed one more time.....
We must be the diversity hires.
Who's leg do you have to hump to get ahead in this place?
They're not that smart.  Yesterday, I asked one to fetch me a latte and he brought back a grande mocha.
And just who am I going complain to David? Human Resources?
Once the butt sniffing is over, they're actually pretty productive.
We don’t call it Hump Day here.
They just keep accepting cookies.
The glass ceiling is gone. Now if they'd only do something about the invisible fence.
I don't care what you think.  When they hump my leg it is workplace harassment.
I say "butt sniffer" one time, and now they are making me do sensitivity training.
They sent Lady home because she went into heat.  That’s just not right.
We thought, instead of a service dog, why not a customer service dog?
Why can't they just use their name to mark their stuff?
At least they sent us some young dogs.  Teaching the old ones computer programming was impossible.
How does someone like me succeed here? This place is run by men. And now they only hire their best friends!
I've only been working here for a year, but it feels like seven.
I’m a good girl too. Where’s my treat?
Let's go for a w-a-l-k.
I've only worked here a month now, but it feels like seven
Bosses hire their best friends,Gil,that's just how this company works.
He licked me. Can I call HR?
And I still on get 82 cents for every dollar THEY make
How is sniffing my crotch not harassment?
Nothing seems to matter to this company except loyalty.
Now every staff meeting is "good boy this," and "good boy that."
On the upside, I have the bathroom all to myself."
I never hear the whistle when it’s time to go home.
It’s weird everyone acts like my best friend around here.
My last name is Pomeranian. How did you get the job?
Don’t worry. On the Internet, no one knows you’re a person.
Ok. I get called out for the length of my skirt, but Mark doesn’t have to wear pants?
It’s not so bad. We all get to go outside for our breaks now.
Why do we have to work seven hours for every hour they work?
I'm tired of sitting, can we go o-u-t-s-i-d-e ?
They love overtime.  You just have to ask them to stay.
I had to literally beg to get this job.
Do they even vet these new employees anymore?
Goodboy...the password is Goodboy
I’m talking to HR about the crotch sniffing.
If the manager humps my leg one more time I'm filing a sexual harassment claim.
They're taking over the place, I tell you. I hear there's a fire hydrant in the men's room.
They were much more fun when they just played poker
I'm not crazy about the cats over in accounting either, but at least they use a box.
They'll reach their full retirement age in six or seven years. We've still got 42 to go!
The next time I hear ' Who's a good girl! There's a good girl!" I'm going to clobber somebody....
Do you have any idea what pronouns we’re supposed to use here?
You scratch one good boy's belly and suddenly you're in all day harassment training."
I find it really hard to believe that no cats applied.
Check your texts! I can’t just say, ‘Do you wanna go for a walk?’ out loud or they’ll all come!
Just when I mastered Pekingese, I get a caller who speaks Pomeranian.
Can you believe they're putting in a gender neutral fire hydrant?
I still don't think you should have called her a bitch.
The guy next to me asked for a belly rub,is that appropriate?
“Where will it all end? Today, it’s no-leash Friday. Next thing you know, they’ll replace the drinking fountain with a toilet bowl
It’s worse in Accounting. They’re cats.
I can't get paid as much as a man and now I have to compete with his best friend too?!?
It's sunny, how about a w..a..l...k  at lunch?
How do they know JavaScript, but I have to spell w-a-l-k to avoid a rush for the door?
How do I tell him he’s such a good boy without being condescending?
Should we break it to them that they don't really get cookies when they press "accept"?
Not only are they loyal, obedient, and trustworthy, they work for belly-rubs. How do we compete with that?
Asking me to scratch him behind his ears is no way for a supervisor to act.
I keep getting emails that just say, "who's a good boy?"
I’m sick of the boss giving jobs to his best friends.
I don't care if he's your best friend. 
You have to tell him about his breath!
We've both been here for a year and he acts like he's got 7 times as much experience as me.
I got the raise, but I had to roll over and beg for it.
I have a cat on the line, what do I say?
Eric, the dress code requires a shirt with  a collar or a collar.
But she IS a bitch.
No, Dave, it doesn't mean you can say "bitch" in the office now.
Don’t let them order lunch again.
Everyone is getting dewormed at lunch. You in?
Code faster or we'll have to wear the cones again.
All I'm saying is that we should get walk breaks, too.
They get to work naked AND eat at their stations? How is that fair?
Does the men’s room also have a tree in it?
This is not what I thought they meant by 'white-collar workers'.
They call it telebarketing.
I think these are the computer labs.
Do you think we are next? HR was interviewing a pair of golden retrievers this morning.
We can't compete. They work for treats.
We're invited for drinks after work, but the place is a toilet
No, you get the ball!
But it's easier for you. You're their best friend.
Every time I throw Frank a new lead, he just brings it right back to me.
Frank didn't make his numbers last month so they had to put him down.
How do you get a raise or promotion around here when your coworkers settle for a pat on the head?
They won the company in a poker game!
I don't care if he went to Bard, if he licks my face again I'm going to HR.
I can't work in this environment! I'm going for a w-a-l-k.
It’s mostly just Google searches for “Who’s a good boy?”
Yeah on the job application I lied too.  Said I was a Rottweiler.
Why are we whispering? They don’t speak English.
When they advertised a 'living wag' I thought it was a typo.
C'mon, just yell "Squirrel!"
We all started on the same day. It’s my first anniversary but their seventh? Not very fair.
Dogs will do jobs that millennials won’t do.
When did Rex start wearing glasses?
Their 4 years of experience is like 28 of ours.
All they do is cruise the web and mark their territory.
I know, they sniffed mine too!
...and when you make a mistake they rub your nose in it.
Except for when they're taking a drink, I never have to wait for a stall anymore.
I think they're all computer labs.
Maybe we'd get promoted if we pretended to be everyone's best friend, too.
If he licks me again I'm reporting him to Inhuman Resources.
I think he has a leg up on you.
I found out who’s NOT a good boy.
Them?  They're computer labs.
Now we know who's posting all the cat videos.
There's only a fire hydrant in the ladies room!
I think it’s time to mark OUR territory.
I typed in WOW and Spellcheck changed it to BOW-WOW.
The pay is fine, I just hate going potty outside.
He flat out asked me for a tummy rub and HR just laughed .
I thought the new hires were for emotional support, not tech support...
Seriously, he just asked me if I needed to go for a walk!
It’s just that every time I make a little mistake they really rub my nose in it
I’m just saying, wouldn’t it be nice to get the occasional ‘Who’s a good boy?’ like the other interns?
Remember when we worried that immigrants would take our jobs.
I think we were the diversity hires.
A caller just has to say "Good boy" and they get a complete refund.
Seriously, this place hires them right out of obedience school.
Diversity?!  It's three more white males.
The worst part is that there's only one restroom and it's outdoors!
No, I don’t want to go on a W-A-L-K, John.
At least we don't have to work with that bitch in accounting!
The new guy just licked my shoe. I'm reporting him.
I'm willing to sit up, but I'm not begging.
They're just playing poker.
They've spent all morning trying to figure out who's a good boy.
All he does is watch cat videos all day. How did he get a Good Boy on his performance evaluation?
I sweated through Harvard to get an MBA.
Whose face did they lick to get in here?
It's just such a good boys' club.
When did this job go from being white-collar to just collar?
Our new health plan only covers veterinarians!
Do I have to give him a treat every time he makes a sale?"
Just because they're service animals, it doesn't make them customer service animals.
He just kept asking, "Who's a good girl?" I told him he's barking up the wrong tree.
And thanks to that whole 'dog years' thing they're making seven times as much!
I got a “good boy” for my performance review.
I am sick and tired of our CEO's pet projects!
I heard they also get paid seven times what we make.
Should I report him if he tries to hump my leg again?
If one more of them sniffs my butt, I'm leaving.
Do you believe I got barked at for being 5 minutes late!!
Which one is the computer lab?
All they do is watch people videos all day.
I can’t work with these bitches.
Licking yourself is fine for the interns but you try that again I'll file a complaint.
Honestly, he sniffs me less than the last IT guy.
This perv next to me says he wants a tummy rub.
I’m reporting him to HR. He totally sniffed my butt.
And get this, their benefit package includes belly rubs.
All I’m saying is they don’t have thumbs, so we have SOME job security.
I don’t care if it’s just dogs doing it.  Porn is porn.
Care to join me for a w-a-l-k break?
If they ask me to fetch something one more time, I'm gonna to lose it.
I can't compete, Mark. They're working for scraps.
When corporate said they were bringing in the big dogs, I didn't think they meant literally.
Management loves them because they get so excited about greeting new customers.
Did you remember to w-a-l-k the CEO?
We shouldn't have eaten those weed cookies at lunch, Tim.
You're supposed to be their boss, John, not their best friend.
How will we ever get promoted if they keep hiring their best friends?
And when did it become acceptable to openly sniff your coworkers?
I thought it was strange, too, at first, but then I saw that they're just playing online poker.
Technically you’re right, but you still can’t call her THAT.
Since Trump's ban on immigration, we've had to take what we can get.
I don’t care!  You still can’t call her a bitch!
... And then Tim in accounting had the nerve to try and sniff my butt!
You know, an occasional pat on the head would be nice.
All I said was 'doggone it' and they got all upset.
Did you hear that they start collecting their pensions after only eight years?
The small talk is brutal. He asked me if I've ever been wormed.
I'm about to W-A-L-K out of here.
Every email I get here literally says, "Who's a good boy?!
It’s the ASPCA. What do I say?
...so then Max says, I haven't had fleas since the 80s, and Duke just hauls off and bites him. Just stay away from Daisy! he says. And the whole time, Daisy just sits there wagging her tail.
...and he’s been sniffing my hair inappropriately.
We haven’t had a break in hours. You open the door and I’ll pretend to throw a ball down the hall.
He asked me if I would like to throw the ball after work, what exactly does that mean?
And I only make 77% of what a beagle does!
I heard they play poker every night after we leave.
They claim they’re service dogs.
I heard their owners paid someone off to get them into this school.
Remember, Bring a small plastic bag when you walk the boss
Did you know they make seven dollars for every dollar we make?
If Bob says 'throw me a bone' one more time, I'm calling the pound.
They are great workers until they hear “outside “ or “walk.”
Apparently it IS possible to teach an old dog new tricks.
They're amazing, unless someone mentions a W-A-L-K.
You know, just because I don't hear as well as they do, I should still get a treat once in a while, too.
Do you think one of them could retrieve my password?
On the Internet, nobody knows you're NOT a dog either.
Don't worry, they burnout seven times faster.
All I said was ‘doggone it,’ and he reported me to HR!
They're learning how to use the Command key.
Do they have to go crazy every time an email is delivered?
I'm not going to be the one to roll over this time.
Joe... Be a good boy and fetch me a cup of coffee.
They're telebarketers.
Is it really true they put a fire hydrant in the Men's Room?
Calm down!  On the internet, nobody knows you're a human.
Who do you think uploads all the pet videos?
It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to constantly tell them what good boys they are.
Of course we look like slackers, they're working like dogs!
I think it's your turn to take them out.
You basically just have to tell them who’s a good boy.
Just a heads up. These guys are very territorial and have marked their computers.
Really, it's the hydrant in the bathroom that gets me.
If you want to get ahead John, You've got to learn to play ball.
They keep best-friending me.
At least they finally got the lab fixed.
We tried cats but they would eat the mouse.
I thought it was a joke too but the one in the glasses just IM'd me about taking a walk at lunch.
The dogs are playing online poker again.
Should I hit pound?"
All they do is watch cat videos all day.
You sure these new hires have been vetted?
And she says I'm a bitch!?
Of course they're making us look like fools....they can hear things we can't.
They're bright, obedient and tech savvy, but wait until they spot that tennis ball.
It would be cute if they weren't out performing us.
The bus broke down so I had to W - A - L - K to work.
I feel like you’re the only one in class I can talk to.
I can't hear it either.
The boss never calls me a good girl when I do anything well...”
Ever since I was labeled his ‘emotional support companion’  I’ve had to come to work with him every day.
They're not just computer labs. I saw a computer spaniel, too.
But on the Internet, no one knows we’re not dogs!
...I know it’s just how they greet everyone, but it makes me uncomfortable!
No different than anyone else, all they do is watch cat videos.
Of course you're a good boy as well Bob.
You have to beg to get anything around here.
Oh, but it's totally ok for THEM to watch cat videos at work?
Why am I the only one who's not a 'good boy'? I work hard too.
Excuse me, do you speak Spanish?  I have a Chihuahua on the phone.
Maybe they hired us because our first names are Scotty and Buffy.
I'm going out for an awk-way and an ack-snay
No matter what I do,
 I simply cannot retrieve data as fast as these guys.
And you didn't think it was suspicious that all the applicants listed their years of experience in multiples of 7?
I kid you not. Nuggets just submitted a request for a standing desk.
They can code in seven languages but they can't read the sign about picking up their poop?!
Rumor is every year they get paid for seven.
They're all using some search engine called 'Fetch.'
His password is "imagoodboy"
I'm not saying it's favoritism, but when was the last time management threw us a bone?
I'm still being paid 20% less than the dogs for the same work.
Does the boss like me or does he sniff everybody's butt?
... which would be FINE, except they’re reading Breitbart.
It's not fair, they will code all night for a pat on the head.
They'll have to stop calling it Human Resources"
If he refers to me once more as his little bitch, I’m outta here!
Not to generalize, but I find them loyal and engaged.
HR said "butt-sniffing" isn't technically harassment.
I heard the reason they switched to canines is because the felines struggled with the mouse...
So I tell him to keep his paws to himself, or else!
Happy now? They're getting HR involved. I told you to stop telling them to ‘sit’.
And they say I’m the office bitch!
On the internet, nobody knows you’re a human
Remind me again – why are our shifts seven times longer than everyone else’s?
Dave, what ever you do don't press Ctrl + K9
On the Internet nobody knows we're not dogs.
Look. I've had some bad experiences dating coworkers.
They say they've decided to teach themselves new tricks.
And I thought we would be losing our jobs to AI.
Well if you didn’t eat my lunch, then who did?!
I did try to complain about sexual harassment to the HR guy but he just licked my face and humped my leg.
Rover has a good offer from a competitor, but I told him to stay
Don't say stray. They're private contractors."
Now I understand why "Are you housebroken?"  is one of the questions in the job application.
They're such brown-nosers.
I can't even say I'm "dog-tired"?! Everyone's so sensitive these days.
Well, to be fair, you should have labeled your lunch.
Did you just call me "bitch?"
Luna's great, but I swear Roscoe only got the job because his owner's on the board.
I thought we'd be safe from layoffs, but in dog years they have seniority.
I asked. All they say is “This is where we do our business” and then giggle.
Anyway they're better colleagues than the cats were.
The great thing about the internet is they don’t know you’re a human.
And we were afraid they'd replace us with robots...
How am I supposed to know who's a good boy?
What frosts me is that I'm earning only 77% of what they do.
The boss says this is one of his pet projects.
What makes you think we’re being replaced?
I know, but with the new office snacks, my hair is now strong and shiny
Just tell him he's going for a car ride.
How much 'emotional support' does everyone need around here?
You see the one with the glasses, he gave me an unwanted lick on my face.
They've blocked all the cat videos.
On the internet no one knows I'm a human.
I'm not hearing it either!
I want to know why we just get a coffee break but 'they' get to go for a ride in the car!?
What do you say if someone wants to speak to a real person?
They must be really good at retrieving files.
Don't worry.  On the internet, no one knows you're human.
Someone marked the new copier as their territory.
I assumed the training would be on paper.
We're in trouble Matt, I just saw a poodle and a yorkie in the HR waiting room.
We've had a hard time staffing ever since men have been held accountable for their actions
All they do is watch funny human videos
Guess who's watching people videos again.
Who’s a good coworker? Who’s a good coworker?
I'm quitting. The boss has been pawing me in the break room.
YOU were the one who wanted to work at White House!
I liked it better when they just played poker
Can you believe the nepotism? The boss hired all his best friends.
The owners think I take them to the park...
I heard the men's room is a tree.
Whatever you do, don't mention roll-over IRA's.
At least the 401K is based on dog years.
I don't get it. All they talk about are their owners.
So when do we tell them "cookies" aren't treats?
...and they work an hour but get paid for seven!
These brown nosers are making us look bad.
Whatever you do, don't say the words "car" or "ride."
What was I SUPPOSED to say when my boss asked me to work on his 'Pet Project'?
Employee of the Quarter" is apparently now "Best in Show
They’re all on dating sites pretending they’re not dogs.
I bet we were hired because our names are Spike and Fritzy."
I don’t care about H.R.; throw the ball and yell, ‘Fetch!’
On the Internet, nobody knows you're not a dog.
Let's throw the ball and free up some bandwidth.
They just watch cat videos all day.
Just remember, on the internet no one knows you're NOT a dog, either.
I'm not sure which bathroom I'm supposed to use.
Why am I the only one who gets called a bitch?!
We'll never get promoted here – for every year of work, they get seven dog years of experience.
Who do you have to lick around here to get a bowl of treats?
It's a lot easier to 'work like a dog' when you're an actual dog.
The boss has been barking at me all day
God, this place is full of brown nosers.
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted a white collar job.
Must be why they call it white collar.
How did they get into U.S.C?
How come they get treats?  We don't get treats
Do you think I can pet him without risking harassment charges?
You've heard of emotional support animals? -- these are technical support animals.
I really hate these "Bring Your Human to Work" days but it means so much to them.
I'm getting tired of them transferring a call to me every time someone wants to talk to a bitch
The one on my right? Her parents paid a fortune to get her into an elite obedience school.
They haven't noticed the ball yet.  Should I say something?
Does ‘Me Too’ cover lower body sniffing?
And then I told him, just keep your paws to yourself!
All they do is watch cute human videos online.
Yea, I had to roll over to get this job.
One of the new hires ate my gym shoes.
I had to play ball with these guys to get this job.
I'm going out. Do you have an extra plastic bag?
This is worse than Google. The Finance VP just humped my leg in the break room.
What's my problem?  What's my PROBLEM!  I just found out even THEY'RE getting paid more than me!
They’re really good coders once you get them to sit.
I go to high-five him and he LICKS my hand! Who DOES that?
On the internet will anyone know I'm not a dog?
Just watch what happens when they see a SQRL protocol.
I can’t believe there are fire hydrants in the rest rooms.
Big deal.  My cat was online years ago.
She said I scratched behind her ear inappropriately...
I think we've been hacked.  They all use the password "Pavlov."
The new guy licked my face!
He still claims the leg humping thing was consensual.
Someone's been going through my trash file.
I already trained them to sit and stay. Now we’re on to rollover your 401(k).
The brown-nosing around here is getting out of control!
He keeps asking if I want to have lunch at the park.
They're watching kitten videos. What about the ones on your side?
On the Internet, nobody can tell you're a real person.
They're just visiting random websites looking for cookies.
I lied on my application.  I can't bark!
The guy on my right has been staring at a raw steak photo for the last 30 minutes!
So being housebroken is the only job requirement?
As I heard it from my friend in HR, the chimpanzees thought the job was beneath them.
For not having opposable thumbs, his code is impressively clean.
No, I'm not a coder. I'm his walker.
Who enabled cookies?
How do I even qualify for 'Good Boy of the Month'?
So I told him to mark the important emails and you don't even want to know the rest.
...and for your information, I’m not the only bitch that works here!
Have you noticed this week's meeting agendas all focus on obedience?
Sure, it’s fine for them but when I come to work naked it’s deemed “inappropriate” by HR
On line, nobody knows I’m human.
Apparently management wants to change our retirement savings plan to a 401K-9.
I thought we were supposed to lose our jobs to robots.
I don't care if he is married to the boss's daughter, I'm not going to spend my lunch hour playing fetch with him anymore.
If you get stuck, just say "Who's a good boy?"
I don’t want to overreact, but all the cats are gone.
My boss is a bitch!
‘Which restroom are they going to use?’
The restroom is a patch of grass?!
Can you believe someone ate my lunch for the third day in a row?
The worst part?  On the Internet, no one knows they're dogs!
It all started when they made this a “dog-friendly workplace.”
It was bad enough when they played poker.
I'm sick of management putting us on these pet projects!
They literally work for food...
I'm all for diversity, but have you seen the new menu in the employee cafeteria?
No joke, I heard the new Director of ICE is a Border Collie!
They're great, but don't leave your lunch alone.
Tell me you brought a plastic bag.
No, you can't sniff my butt.
Cat Tuesday is even worse !
Guess who just opened an account on petsmart.com with your credit card?
It’s a bit too dog-friendly a workplace, if you ask me.
Apparently you can teach an old dog to fetch data.
Ironically, they're very catty to work with.
Yes. We're the last.
Yeah, but throw one stick...
I don’t know why I even bother coming to work...I’ll NEVER be top dog around here!”
I know I’m late. For some reason I just never hear the whistle.
Seriously, they're all reading Orwell!
When the hiring manager said it took a 'rare breed' to work here, I should have put two and two together.
I don't care if they're your best friends.
Can’t they stock the vending machines with anything besides kibble and toilet bowl water?
The real question is, who let the dogs IN?
They're very loyal.
Psst... what did you put for 'Who's a good dog?'
Somehow, I thought computer lab would have more computers, and fewer Labs.
Do you keep getting pop up ads for flea collars?
All I said was ‘“Dog Gone It” and now I’m up on harassment charges.
The unisex bathroom is a mess too!
Our manager said if we work extra hard he’ll throw us a bone or two.
I keep explaining that the client can’t SEE that they’re wagging their tails
No, it's not me, did you check your shoes?
Bow-wow. The password is Bow-wow.
They're being allowed " comfort humans" starting next week!
I’m not the bitch in this situation Greg.
If I agree to go with him to the dog park, is that considered a date?
I can't go one day without being asked out on a walk.
They replaced WHAT with a fire hydrant?
Remember when people outnumbered the emotional support animals?
I heard that Fifi only got that promotion because she's such an ass sniffer."
That son-of-a-bitch makes 30% more than me.
Not only do they have their Masters degrees but they also have obedience training.
I thought it was robots who were supposed to take our jobs.
I try to sneak one cat video on my break and the place goes bananas!
Do you ever wonder if we are overqualified?
The client asked, and he just rolled right over."
So, do you think I should take Oreo's leg humping to HR, or was it only meant to show affection?
It's YOUR turn to take them outside, Kyle.
I mean, nobody told you to "stay."
What are we supposed to do? Just rollover and play dead?
Eight pee breaks is excessive.
EVERY time the doorbell rings?
No sink, no water fountain, just that bowl on the floor! Is that even legal?
They want us to join them at the 'no leash' park for happy hour.
I dunno...I guess the cats refused to work overtime.
At least they’re all byte no bark.
The guy next to me won't stop watching cat videos.
If there are fire hydrants in the bathrooms then I'm outta here!
Im worried Pete. I heard they’re bringing in the big dogs next.
He licks himself after every sale.
I thought firing the cats was a good idea too, until they installed the fire hydrant in the break room.
What’s with the fire hydrant in the break room?
Can you believe Jim here is looking at kitty porn?
It’s asking me for the name of the street I grew up peeing on.
And to think I was soooo worried about artificial intelligence taking my job.
I wouldn't mind if we didn't have to walk them.
This is NOT what I meant when I said hire someone to retrieve data!
Is there an indoor restroom in this place?
Why is the wi-fi password 'Pavlov'?
No, you may not sniff my butt.
Bring-your-human-to-work day sucks!
But Jerry, on the internet no one knows you’re a human.
Guess what they said when I asked where the bathroom was?
I didn't even know there was such a thing as squirrel porn.
I know I should be upset, but they're well-groomed, focused, and I love the 'walk around the block' breaks every two hours.
I'm his emotional support animal.
Next week I start training my replacement. But they say he’s a good boy, so...
Well if  YOU didn't chew up my hard drive, then who did?!
Hey John, just out of curiosity, have you ever lied on a resume?
Maybe it's time to stop worrying about robots taking our jobs.
See, I told you! Once the ball is out of their sight, they can be more productive than the two of us put together..
They're really good at finding bitcoin.
You're telling me you've never seen a computer lab before?
On the internet, no one knows you’re a dog.
WTF, I just found out Rex is making more than me.
One of them is looking at paintings of dogs playing poker, and the other one is playing poker.
How can we compete?  They're incentivized by belly rubs.
All they do is look at cat videos on YouTube.
You'd think if they were having a bring-your-owner-to-work day, they'd have something useful for us to do.
What a bunch of brown-nosers.
I'm so tired of having to W-A-L-K on eggshells.
If he smells me once more, I'm getting an Invisible Fence around my workstation.
They take our jobs and don't even bother to speak our language! This is why I voted for Trump.
Then the guy at station three tried to sniff my butt during the 10 o' clock break!
They asked me to play poker with them after work.
You could have been clearer when you said I'd be working with a bunch of animals, Bob."
You have to hold it in until the boss takes us for a walk.
They wont keep their paws off me.
The thing is, they don’t really work that hard.
They're so smug. I mean, it's not like I expect THEM to pick up MY poop!
Yesterday it was a room full of monkeys with typewriters.
He's only flagging the cat videos.
Of course they’re taking our jobs. They work for kibble!
It's your turn to let them out!
I don't care if they can hear me. I want to go for a walk.
They work in packs. 
We don’t have a chance.
My performance review said 'works like a dog' so I guess that's good, right?
Whoa! You dropped acid last night too?
I heard they’re making more than us, right out of obedience school!
Do you get asked to fetch things too?
He won’t stop looking at kitty porn!
What's the problem? We're getting great customer reviews since they took over the call center.
I don't care if it makes me culturally insensitive - I NEVER like to hear a female called a bitch.
You said TeleBarketing was just a clever name.
If they didn't spend half their time looking at cat videos, this wouldn't be so bad.
This isn't what I expected working for a pet friendly company.
Stop watching cat videos! You know how easily our coworkers get distracted.
Before cutting costs, we had only counselors at this hot line - but now they can choose to speak with an emotional support animal"
This is such a good boy's club.
You don't smell that?
Rosie reported me to HR for saying she's Husky.
If PETA finds out about this, we are screwed!
I'm a bit worried about the lunch buffet…
I hate bring your person to work day
Even the well-trained ones waste hours on cat videos.
On the Internet, they don't know you're a human!
Just wear a flea collar like i do.
This isn't what I was expecting when they said it was a dog-friendly workplace.
If you ask me, they're all a bunch of brown-nosers.
I think most of them aren’t even licensed
People just love them immediately. How are we supposed to compete with that?
And we were worried about AI!
These are the new watchdogs Facebook hired to help us monitor inappropriate content.
I'll warn you now, our department is all bitch, bitch, bitch.
We're the only ones here who catch the nuances. The rest of them see everything as black or white.
They work, like, one-seventh as hard as we do.
I just cant compete, these guys seem to able to smell a good trade.
I thought they preferred laptops.
Check out the one with the resting bitch face.
Can you believe management wants to send us to obedience training?
They're all watching 'stupid cat trick' clips!
Is your seat wet too?
What in the world is a "fetch engine?"
It started as a favor to the shelter, but they're better at it than the people they replaced.
They expect us to work like dogs!
Her screen name is "Computer Lab"!
Our employer is very considerate.
The bathrooms here have both toilets AND fire hydrants.
Remember, no laser points at the meeting, alright?
They're working on the Lab report.
I have reason to suspect that they were involved in the recent admissions scandal.
What do you say if they ask for a real person?
OMG! He just "best-friended" me on Facebook."
Cover me for a sec? Gotta go use the fire hydrant.
I hate being the token woman in this office.
I heard they cancelled the outsourcing to India.
And then... he put his paw on my shoulder!
Then I had to show her where they sniffed me on a doll!
Those mushrooms were not a good idea, billy.
Its so unfair,they are always so happy and attentive
It's the pack mentality here that I have trouble with.
- This is unacceptable, the senior dogs are being replaced by puppies with no experience.
I saw Fido's pay stub and even HE earns more than me!!!
There is a literal DOG sitting next to you, and you have a problem with a woman working here?!
When will they learn to do their business outside?
Why am I always stuck with refilling the water bowl in the break room?”
And I was worried about automation.
Have you seen my tennis ball?
This is what happens when the company’s website starts using cookies.
I wish he would just work from home on the days leading up to bath day.
Well, there goes the opposable thumb theory.
But hey, we’re the last employees who still get dental.
I hate these 'bring-your-human-to-work days'.
I'm just worried about the food they'll cater at our staff meeting.
Is leg-humping sexual harassment?"
And here we were, worried about robots."
Do you know where the restrooms are? All I could find was an indoor fire hydrant.
If they can do it, why can't my Dad?!
I just asked him if he could fetch me something, and he put on those noise-cancelling headphones and won’t even look at me now.
I think I’m the first female hire... not sure though.
They keep saying, 'On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.'
I guess we've traded the 'good old boy' network for the 'good boy' version......"
They're on "amortize."  My dog's still working on "stay."
It keeps autocorrecting my search engine to "Good boy"
Don't you hate "Bring your master to work" day.
I think they’re playing video poker.
I don't know about you, but I think taking the Alpo account was a mistake.
If this new hiring continues, I swear I am going to W-A-L-K right out of here.
I checked with the others  ...  we were all told this job would be a walk in the park.
And to think I was worried about robots!
They're working as online service dogs.
And then I said, “I don’t WANT a dog biscuit, I want a RAISE!”
When's the last time the boss threw US a bone?
All cat videos are completely blocked!
They're not doing any work!  They're just looking at cat videos.
They're using "dawg" and "bitch" ironically, right?
I worry we are becoming the underdogs around here...
Mr. Schilling left the business to his dog.  This does not bode well for us.
Is the New Yorker this desperate for writers?
Say Hashtag...never Pound!
On the internet, no one knows you're a person.
And you were worried about robots?
So what if we're token hires? It's a good gig."
Max from accounting keeps trying to sniff my butt.
I don't care if that's how they 'greet' each other."
he just asked me to fetch him coffee!
I don't care how good they are--I'm not giving any more belly rubs
He says it's his pet project.
I could use a break. Does anyone else want to take a walk?
I don't know what's happening, they were just playing poker a minute ago
Why are their videos getting so many more hits than ours?!
Don't worry, on the web no one knows we're human!
You've GOT to learn to sit, Jayden, or you're never  gonna make it.
...And on Friday's, it's 'Casual Collar' day.
You can't blame every fart on your colleagues, George!
Bitch!” still sounds perjoritive to me
I heard they're friends with that bitch from HR.
I didn't expect this when they said it was 'Dog-friendly' .
But, he's not a good boy...he watches cat videos all day.
Why do they watch cat videos all day long?
I don't care if she's in a protected class. Drinking out of the ladies room toilet is gross.
So now we have to offer emotional support?
Milo won't talk to me because he caught me watching cat videos.
They work cheap now, but wait till they organize.
Don't worry. On the Internet, they don't know you're not a dog.
They can sniff out the hackers
This office is a total good boys' club.
All day they’re online playing poker.
So much for being loyal; I heard he's interviewing at Google next week.
All they're doing is looking at stupid human videos.
They must be the new breed of programers we heard about!
I think she's a bitch too, but you should really keep your voice down.
You are the one looking for promotion, Rick. So what if you have to rub some bellies few times a day?
He's watching cat videos, again!
Who’s going to hang up on a dog?
He keeps asking me to rub his belly - SO not cool.
so wait... I just click K and then 9 and then delete?
Look, I know that last fart was you.
On the web no one knows.
I figured "Woof" was just a clever company name.
All they do is watch cat videos.
You know, when the interviewer asked if I was a ‘good girl’ I just thought he was being sexist.
They'll only take a break if you throw the ball.
I thought we were being replaced by robots.
It was cute when they played poker, but this is too much.
If Rex gets Employee of the Month one more time, I'm gonna scream!
Why are we whispering?
Apparently there's a new hookup site called 'Bone'.
Can you believe they're switching us to Macs because they like the 'Command' key?
Bruno, the one with the glasses
He’s a brown-noser
I don't know what annoys me more,the fact that they slobber all over the place or that they're better than me.
It's your turn to walk Engineering.
You'll have to get used to the sniffing hiney thing. They just want to know what you had for lunch.
But what I really hate are the new snacks in the vending machine!
'Bring your owner to work day' .
I just know they're talking about us.
pssst... Did we miss a memo last week?
I can stand the whining, but the territory marking is beyond the pale.
It must be coming up to deadline. Rosie never eats at her desk.
Can you believe they had no resources left for MY pet project?
Have you seen that new poodle in Marketing? I heard she rolled over during her first interview.
I can't remember the last time the boss gave me a treat.
I don't mind the temps they brought in, but the new boss is a real bitch!
I can't compete. They work for kibble.
I guess I should have taught my dog Delete and Save instead of Sit and Stay
I regret not saying I was a cat person
Just tell him you like parks and rides in the front seat ,but mailmen give you the creeps.
I guess they can teach old dogs new tricks."
There appears to be an issue with our facial recognition security system
What should I do? The Australian Shepherd asked me out!
I'm just saying, some cat diversity would be nice.
He just ate the mouse!
Everyone denied stealing my lunch from the fridge.
I don't care if it triples my quota; I'm NOT ending every call with "Now who's a good boy??!!"
Doesn't it bother you that everyone else is nude?
Out?! Who let them in!?
At least they're better than the pigs who used to work here.
Nobody on the internet knows we're humans.
I just feel as if I don’t pass the sniff test
You hear that, right? He's says only a dog can hear it.
If one more millennial puppy asks me to pet him I'll scream.
We're next.
When I was growing up, they used to just play outside.
Every time the mail room person arrived, they all chased him.
Their temps, the monkeys got promoted.
They’re part of a new breed.
The help wanted ad said this was a white-collar job.
On tech support no one knows you're a dog.
This whole bring your dog to work day is getting out of hand.
If someone tells me to "wag more" one more time, I quit.
Yeah, weirder and weirder, but Trump demanded security clearances for them.
I had a sneaking suspicion that our company's "bring your dog to work" policy had an ulterior motive!
Do you have any t-r-e-a-t-s with you?
Could you tell the guy next to you to chew with his mouth closed?
Alporithm? What's that?
This office has been way too quiet ever since they lost their B-A-L-L.
I don’t think these new hires were properly vetted.
No, I'm NOT ok with you breaking our date so you can go play poker with the boys tonight!
And we thought we’d be replaced by robots.
I'm not happy with this 'Take-your-owner-to-work' day.
Everybody here is a son of a bitch!
I think I misunderstood this whole 'bring your dog to work'  day.
If this keeps up, soon we'll be working for treats.
I wanted everyone to get a standing desk, but the others voted to sit
I mean, he's cute and all but I don't want to wake up with fleas
I yearn for the days before online gambling when they just played poker around the table like normal dogs.
I’m so tired of being the token humans.
I keep getting looked over for promotions. It's a total "Good Boy's" club.
I know I shouldn't be surprised, but they're watching Fox News.
Tree break? What's a tree break?
I liked it better when it was a rat race.
He just swallowed my mouse.
At least nobody steals my yoghurt from the fridge anymore.
It's a dog/e-dog world
I feel I'm being judged for being a cat person.
A cat would handle a mouse better
It's not a system bug, it's fleas.
I just want to make more than a golden retriever
...OMG! Gary looks JUST like his dog!
Does she have to eat at her desk?
All they do is play online poker!
I don't we should be subjected to the same spayed and neutered policy
It's not their fault; the boss told them to sit and stay.
Well, YOU have obviously never tried wearing a skirt to the morning greeting.
Sure, they'll hire dogs at the entry-level, but just tell me why the managers are all cats.
I remember when we brought them to work.
Is this how Gen X felt about millennials?
For morale, we let them bring their owners in on Fridays.
I thought it was a computer lab, not computer LABS!
Bitches, am I right?
This isn’t the type of diversity I was pushing for.
Nothing we can do. They all have security clearance.
They're loyal.
'We're screwed. They' re moving to ultrahigh frequency.'
Don't worry, if their are no open computers you can just throw a ball.
This is not what I pictured when we said the office was pet-friendly
They want us to train them AND take them out?
I'm afraid too many of the prospects have collar-ID.
I just got a text.
“Jimmy’s stuck in a well!”
Have you spoken to Jeff in HR about it?

I tried but he just kept humping my leg...
I'm out. We're just chasing our tails here.
Like I told the others....keep your paws off me.
Im  tired of their we'll pee where we want attitude.
I feel like unless I can sit, heel, and fetch, I won't get ahead at this company.
I’m an emotional support human.
Max is getting promoted because he has seniority in dog years.
Gimme a break. I"m only human.
'They keep asking if I need to go for a walk?'
Right, but in this world, on the internet, no one knows you are NOT a dog."
The fleas are a drag but it's totally a step up from bro culture.
There's three dogs here, okay?  It wasn't me!
I just don't believe they are customer service dogs.
No! It's your turn to throw the ball!
They all use the same password - K9.
Did we miss a memo?
...and you should have seen them at the water cooler.
I you don't want to be replaced, keep throwing the ball!
You're ok. The big dog said it was a person-friendly office.
And that little one with the glasses started barking orders at me.
They work 1 hour for every 7 hours we do, but they get equal pay!
They can really smell a profit.
He was barking orders and then told me to fetch coffee.
She's been surfing the Petco website so long she drooled on my keyboard!
To get ahead you have to be a real butt-sniffer around here.
Just throw the ball and we'll grab their code.
Tony, you can't refer to yourself as the Big Dog in team meetings.  Know the room.
Hey, what's you collar ID?
I'm pretty sure we're the only vegans left here
Are you going to this poker night they keep talking about?
Whose idea was it to request an unlimited supply of used tennis balls?
Their data retrieval is off-the-charts.
I am only wearing this flea collar until my shares are vested.
Are they rescues or interns?
These techies are a different breed.
My god, the typos!
It's going to take some getting used to, having the fire hydrants inside.
I didn't realize how boring "bring your human to work" day would be. My dog hasn't asked me to throw the ball once!
Shhh. Wanna go for a walk?
Whats retirement age in dog years?
So, who's this new Bitch?
Everyone is always on such a tight leash around here.
My boss is a real bitch.
You're the only guy working here who's not a complete dog.
All the adorable cat video sites are blocked
Can we switch places? He keeps leaning over and licking my face!
Its still true that on the internet nobody knows you’re a dog
Then I find out even the dogs are being paid more than me.
I'm really more of a cat person.
Should I be concerned this dog is searching for human shock collars?
Which part of "I've been working like a dog" would you say is still unclear to you Josh?
I’m glad I don’t have collar I.D.
Sure they speak, but can they kvetch?
I can’t be the only one who thinks that co-workers shouldn’t sniff each other’s butts without consent!
On the internet, they can't tell we're not dogs.
They say on the internet no one knows if you are a dog.
Okay, you win. We'll try the robots.
They will leave if you throw the ball...
Being promoted after only a year sounds fast but to him it felt like seven.
Just throw the ball!
What else was I suppose to do, I smelled his butt too.
When they said I'd be working with canines, I thought I would be studying dentistry.
I know!  It feels like we’ve been chasing our tails all day!
He pawed me and then tried to mount my leg.
I guess Trump didn't think of how severely his mass-deportation proposal would affect call centers...
I thought "telebarketer" was a typo, didn't you?
Yeah, well, at least they're all Democrats
He sniffed my butt!  I'm pretty sure that qualifies as sexual harassment, especially at this company!
Things have really changed around here since we got that Alpo account.
This is the third time today Steve has asked me to go on a walk with him. Do you think he's trying to flirt with me?
If I hear "Who's a good boy" one more time.
I told him three different times that I didn't want to go on a walk with him. You need to talk to him, Peter — he's your best friend.
Look, all I'm saying is that just because my lunch was in a doggy bag, doesn't mean it was up for grabs.
I don't think the company fully understands what service dogs are used for.
They told me I was going to have to be a real bitch to fit in on Wall Street but I didn’t think they were serious!
I think petting them will get you in a lot of trouble!
I know! But on the Internet no one knows they’re dogs
...and the HR poodle doesn't grasp why I find their way of greeting me offensive.
In a call center, nobody knows you’re human.
And then he said 'Oh,I didn't realize that was your kibble in the fridge.'
If they had their way, they'd fetch and retrieve data all day long!
Because a cat would eat the computer mouse.
They are out selling us. Throw the ball!
I guess they do dog obedience school online now.
I thought interns were supposed to be good at fetching things.
One day they're playing poker, next day we're out of a job.
He gets his bowl at the table but I can't take a smoke break.
Karen? Yeah, she’s definitely a bitch.
Are you sure the password is "woof?"
Can you believe all the butt sniffing and tail wagging around here?
Okay, yes, the treats in the break room are paleo now, but why do we have to pee outside?
I don't have any proof, but I'd swear they were cheating at the poker game last night.
Believe it or not, incidents of crotch sniffing have actually gone down.
When they said this was a human-friendly workplace, I should have asked more questions.
He thinks I can't hear that high-frequency podcast, but I can - and, it's FILTHY!
The management says they spend less time on Facebook.
It took forever just to get him to sit
The supervisor has been sniffing around me again.
... so I said, 'sure, Bring Your Human To Work Day sounds like fun'
Yes, their language training is showing progress, but have you visited the restrooms lately?!
And at break they'll want to "Get to know you by scent".  At least you're not wearing a dress.
Is it normal that my coworker tried to sniff my butt?
Don't worry, Jim. Just tell the boss that the dogs ate your project report.
Frisbees, squirrels, mailmen, open car windows - do you understand this video game?
If you want to keep your job here at PETA, you better tell HR you're adopted.
I don’t understand a word they growl, but they really move product.
I can't believe it. These guys just show up nude EVERY day!
How should I know? I'm a temp too...
You become a dog after you say ‘Your call is really important to us’ the one-millionth time.
I can deal with the constant barking, but have you seen the bathrooms?
He won't even shake hands.
I wouldn't worry about the boss—his bark is much worse than his bite.
Did you take my stress ball?
They're only colleagues, Jake, not your new "best friends."
Who keeps sending me this poodle porn?
We'd  get a lot more done if they's quit prank-calling so many cats.
On the plus side, we get free vet care after 7 dog years.
Why do we always have to sit next to the sub-woofers?
I asked them to leave but they insist they're search dogs.
Are you a "Service Human" too?
Don't get me wrong, the all-species fire hydrant is really inclusive but I think we need our own bathroom.
I don’t understand why she had to bark at me like that. How was I supposed to know they broke up?
When did IT block cat videos?
It’s like we read in The New Yorker over a decade ago, “On the internet, no one knows you’re a dog”.
No need to bark at me, just use your regular speaking voice.
They're all bark. Gary doesn't even know what a byte is.
And we worried that we could be replaced by robots.
I don't care that they're dogs, but they're Republicans!
Alright, they can stay, but you're walking them.
He smelled my butt too.
Did you see what Max did when the mail came?
Just watch how productivity drops when you pull up a cat video.
It's not a bad job but it's fetch this, fetch that; or yes, who's a good boy.
Why the sudden ban on watching cat videos?
They've been fetching data all day.
"You want your ball back, you're going to have to get it yourself.
Fetch me a file!  Fetch me a file!!  Are they kidding?
What should I do ? This Great Dane next to me just emailed and asked if  I wanted to go out for a bite.
They aren’t  following the commands.
Psst, they're sending each other videos of humans doing regular everyday activities.
I hate this place and all the buttsniffers who work here.
Do you think we have to pee outside too?
If you want someone to fetch you coffee, I suggest you ask one of your new best friends.
These new hires are such brown-nosers!
Oh, pleeease. Don't even try to blame the dog!
Sure they’re cute, but you’re looking at your replacement.  They’re friendly and loyal and will work for table scraps.
The boss keeps all the new employees on a short leash.
Who's George Orwell?
So how did you remove your shock collar?
I thought "on the Internet, no one knows you're a dog" was just a meme.
I guess it's true. On the internet, no one really does know you're a dog.
You're also here for 'Bring Your Human to Work Day'?
It’s embarrassing, dad keeps promoting other family members ahead of us.
Don't worry; on the Internet, nobody knows you're not a dog!
Did you take my squeakie toy?
Trust me--don't do it. You won't believe what they did to the last whistleblower.
There's no way we're in the running for "Good Boy of the Month".
He’s growling because the Google image results for ‘hot dog’ weren’t quite what he wanted.
Do we get walk breaks too?
Resistance meeting tonight. 8pm. Former Hello Kitty store.

These guys spend all day playing online poker!
Every hour they get a walk, a treat and a belly rub!
They don't need to sign-in. They just mark their computers.

I think some people are abusing the emotional support animal thing.

"The last thing I want to hear right now is that I'm fetching."
And I was worried about being replaced by AI!

So, how did your temp agency describe this position?
This 'bring your dog to work day' thing has gotten way out of control.

It’s the placement of ‘Lab’ in the title that confused me.
I don't know what Steve's problem is - I called him a GOOD boy!
I'd take it too.  They get paid in "dog years"; most are eligible to retire in 5 years.

guys are animals.
Well, at least when the boss barks at us, they can bark back.
On our next break, it's going to be your turn to walk him.
It's 'Bring your Masters to Work Day'
What? You’ve never heard of diversity in the workplace?
Why didn’t I get called a good girl?
I think we're about to be outsourced.
No, 'Bring Your Pet to Work Day' means you bring them to your office, not to actually 'work.'
Apparently it has something to do with an old New Yorker cartoon.
My last office was a pig stye.

I love the treats here and enjoy the walks, but I hate it when they grab us and give us a bath.
Word is that management is going to throw us another bone.
I don't want to stereotype, but I think the guy next to me just ate my mouse.
I know - the one next to me stole my bowl too!
First, it was, "Bring your dog to work" day, now it's, "Send your dog to work."
Our diverse recruiting efforts may have gone too far
Um, what’s the deal? I’ve been working like a dog for like 8 weeks now and no promotion. What do they expect me to do, beg?

If you don't stop humming "Who Let the Dogs Out?" I will literally vomit on this keyboard. Literally.
How can we be expected to get anything done with all the yapping going on on?
I think they're barking up the wrong tree.
‘You can’t teach an old dog new tricks’, my ass!
This company diversity program has gotten way out of hand.
The boss hasn't called me "good girl" either, I don't know what's going.
We shouldn't have complained about the Gen Xer's. At least didn't mark their territory!
It's management's strategy to avoid unionization.
Seriously, you gotta use your canine name, or you'll never sell anything.
This outsourcing is getting ridiculous.
Word of advice: everyone's a bitch here.
The bosses love them. They don't smoke, and, they never ask for a coffee-break.

Sure they're quiet now, but wait till they start working on their ruff drafts!
Has this cultural diversity thing gone a little too far?
But noooo. I sniff *one* butt and HR gets all weird about it.
Okay, so I told the recruitment agency I liked working with dogs
I'm here on the diversity program too.
If they get that brain pill, why can’t we?
You and I are the last two human beings willing to work in such a heartless, racist, homophobic, anti-semitic, self-serving, narcissistic, reckless, dangerous, and irrational presidential administration.
This is not the best time to be sharing cat pictures
Just keep the tummy rubs up and you can get away with anything.

It's a new menu. Save is sit and send is fetch.
I told them to fetch the data, but they just find it and drop it without me.
It's a dog eat dog world; why do we even try to compete?
They said it was a human-friendly office.
....and another thing -- everytime I get an email notification these guys start to salivate....
It is your fault that we are here.  Why can't you just sit when you are told?
When will we update our company policy on squirrel videos?
Every time my phone rings, he drools all over his keyboard.
I thought they said we were joining the K-9 unit !

Who knew Bring Your Pet to Work Day would be like this?!?
This place is such a good boys club.
I not saying it's one of the new staffers, but I just stepped in some doody over by the copy machine.
This artificial intelligence is getting out of hand.
Well, except for the fleas...
They thought “Bring Your Pet To Work Day” meant bring your pet to work.
I feel like I'm the only one in the office who finds the "Good Boy of the Month" award to be misogynistic.
Told you the place was going to the dogs.
Ever since they removed the keyboards, anyone can get a job around here.
This is not the doggie style I anticipated.
I still haven't found the computer lab, only computer terriers.
It's bring your dog to work day!
I mean, they did says it’s a dog-friendly office.

Everyone I work with is such a bitch.
This company ties advancement to loyalty. And I'm supposed to be happy about this?
Bring Your Pet To Work Day is getting a little out of hand.

They’re Lori Loughlin’s dogs.
It was bad enough when we had to compete with immigrants for entry-level jobs.
Didn't you read Animal Farm?
I know. She wears the same outfit every day...

So apparently now dogs think, we're THEIR best friend.
What's with all the cat video pop ups?
Did you hear they hired a border collie as our new manager?
I can't stand it. The one next to me is listening to dog whistles.
Why did you have to blow that stupid whistle?
I swear, this new temp agency is sending us their dogs.
Our new workplace harassment policy  doesn’t cover half of what these guys do!
No one is going to believe us when we tell them this is where all those dog whistle politics memes are created
I told you, this bring your dog to work policy was a slippery slope!
I don't get what the boss sees in these bitches.
I tried to tell you, this job will change you.

Yes, yes, Hunter.  I noticed.
Honestly, you men are so disgusting; every time I walk into the room, Rex looks at me like I’m a piece of meat.
I don't get it, either; but, on your next call try whining and heavy breathing.
Now I'm the last one to be against diversification...
I think you might have the wrong bark code.
Bring your dog to work day has really gotten out of hand.
I can’t believe how much my parents paid to get me in here.

Guess I missed the memo about Take Your Dog toWork Day.
But why did they add a coding category to the Westminster Dog Show in the first place?
It's olay. Online, no one knows you're not a dog.
This constant barking of orders is driving me crazy.
You see the email? No vegan options at the company picnic again!
I think we're stuck in that "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog" cartoon.
I’m not dogist. I just don’t like being pawed.
I don't mind that they work for treats, but I have had it with the damn squeaky toy mice.
It’s some kind of on-line poker tournament.
How do I prove I'm not a dog?
I'm for diversity, too, but it still smells in here.
Are you the one making that panting noise?
Okay, I will admit they aren't old but I think coding goes way beyond a 'new trick'.

Can we talk about the elephant in the breakroom, please?
Do I do four woofs or five woofs  if she's giving birth to puppies in her car and I want to tell her the ambulance has been dispatched?

I don’t mind going for a walk with him, but I don’t want to give him the wrong idea.”

-Josh Gartner, Brookly
This admissions thing is getting out of hand
I hear they originally started "Grumpy Cat" as a smear campaign.
So who has been a good boy?
I think the  #WoofToo  Movement has gone too far!
Seriously, throw me a bone.
How am I supposed to know if dog biscuits are gluten-free?
What did you say again seperates us from the other animals?
How come they can remember their password and I can't?
This is truly amazing.  And I thought their ability to play poker was impressive!
I just don't have the heart to tell them we know they're dogs.

I warned you it was a real dog-eat-dog workplace."
It's the new trend of  service animals.
I didn't realize this is what they meant when they said I could bring my dog to work.

If they want to stop all the cat videos, why not tweak the algorithm?
Our chance for advancement has now been limited to pissing up a lamppost!
There's a porta potty  outside for us.
Now I understand why this training session is called "learning new tricks."
Geez, must everyone around here be a brown-noser?
...and another thing, they take way too many potty breaks.
Help me out here. Are tennis balls good for your teeth?
The WiFi password? It's k9bowwow.
Do you have any treats?
I thought they could help sniff out the bugs.
I think they're too embarrassed to watch the cat videos at their house.
We may have a problem. I hear these guys are working for half of what we are being paid.
On the Internet no one can tell if you are a human being!
They heard the internet was full of spam.
Wanna go for a walk and sniff some lampposts or what?
I don't mind having to brew the coffee every morning, but one of these guys should be able to fetch the stapler.
What a suck-up! Wags his tail everytime the boss comes around.
Frank Buckley Andover, MA
They didn't mean you should literally bring your dog *to work.*
So the deal is, they've been brought in to fetch data. But, don't worry, their barks are worse than their bytes.
They work for treats and 'good boys'..."
Company headquarters said it's cheaper than outsourcing to Asia.
These guys just have a nose for coding.
Looks like we’re being eased out.
I didn’t know we could listen to music
On the Internet, nobody knows, but it's you and me who can't get through a single staff meeting without being barked at.
You and I can't compete with these telebarketers
Quickly, what is my dog name, today?
These guys are geniuses but management has to do something about tbe fleas.
Is it just me, or has this business really gone to the dogs?
All I'm saying is I'd be more efficient too, if corporate gave me free trips to the park.
I knew “Bring your dog to work” was a set up!
I told you Randy, I don't date lead programmers only top dogs.
The work isn't so bad, but the weekly meet 'n greet is a must-miss.
I’ve got a feeling we’re in the wrong class.
Well, someone peed on my keyboard.
I heard they now want to be on the dental plan.
I don't know.....the memo said
Rover take over.
I can’t take it much longer. There’s always a bone of contention among them.
Pet-friendly," they said
I was afraid we'd lose our jobs to Artificial Intelligence.
It’s been like this ever since that New Yorker cartoon.
I’m not threatened, but ordering out for lunch has become quite a challenge.
Have you seen my ball?
Management thought hiring them could reduce time wasted on watching cat videos
I can't get past "paw ID"
And some people worry illegal immigrants are taking our jobs!
This aFURmative action policy is getting ridiculous!
How can he possibly expect people to believe his name is really ‘Robert?’
He won't stop listening to Spotify."
I think I'll skip this year's company picnic.
This outsourcing is getting out of hand!
You'll get the hang of it, but I'm telling you: Don't say "doggie bag." Don't mention 'Dog Day Afternoon' or 'Straw Dogs' or 'Reservoir Dogs,' either. Same with 'woofers and tweeters."
I saw my lunch in someone else's bowl!
Their work ethic is really making us millennials look bad!
They have found a kennel that accepts Obama Care!
I'm getting so tired of being treated like a dog around here.
He put his paw on me, should I report this to H.R.?
Apparently minimum wage laws don't apply to them
All day long, “Fetch ”, “Sit”,”Speak”,I just can’t take it anymore!
I think we're just chasing our tails.
I’m sick and tired of working like a dog.
I know this is supposed to be a diverse company, but I'm tired of working for kibble and the occasional tummy rub!
It's an app for on-demand walksharing.
I'm worried about the "pet friendly" concept of the company.
Scientists say most dogs know as many as a hundred words.  I think they're over qualified.
I can’t find the employee bathroom, either.
This guy next to me said he's been here 70 years!
What's our target demographic in dog years?
My station has been marked.
I mean, am I even allowed to use their bathroom?
I'm telling you, they're alright, just don't forward them any cat videos.
I don't mind the dogs but who's this dude on my right?
On the Internet, no one knows they are dogs.
I signed up for a different study but the snacks in the little bowl are so good I stayed.
He borrowed my glasses two hours ago but he's not giving them back!
They’ll do anything for a treat!
Do you ever feel like the last person who still has to use public computer labs?
Corporate should make them speak English.
I’d trade them all for a good Lab.
We're treated like dogs here!
How come the boss lets these guys off the leash all the time and we get stuck picking up the slack?
This all started with a small group of them sitting around a poker table one night.  Do you have an extra flea collar I can borrow?
Don't worry - they'll always need us to speak with Siri and Alexa.
I've been trying to organize, but they all think belly scratches are better than parental leave.
Looks like a new AI: Animal Intelligence
I can't believe Spot got the promotion ahead of me; he hasn't even been here that long.
They’re literally begging for Yelp reviews.
First Poker, now video games?
Sure they're enthusiastic. But every single email is one big typo.
Bitches be crazy.
What are they yapping about?
I'm beginning to think Mr. Fido's hiring process is heavily biased.
It's adorable, but I'm guessing nobody else here wants to watch a cat video.
These people wouldn’t know a funny caption if it bit them in the ass.
They invited me to their poker game, but I’d feel like an outsider...
I hate that bitch!
When I blow the whistle on this place...
Jason, did you even READ the ad before committing us to this temp job?
I didn’t realize this was literally Jim’s “pet” project.
The herd mentality in this place is unbelievable.
This new one is kind of a bitch.
I was expecting to be replaced by Artificial Intelligence, but DOGS?
WHEN are they gonna replace this carpet?
... and they expect us to drink out of that bowl on the floor, too!
Are you going to play fetch after work?
How are 'service animals' giving us emotional support if they replace us?!
When I first got hired, this place was full of bulls and bears.
Do you have any treats? I need this dog's terminal.
They say they're species inclusive, bu do you see any cats here?
He dropped the ball on that last trade.
Between you and me, we wouldn't be in this situation if Fifi hadn't dropped the ball!
I thought you were going to fetch me a cup of coffee.
What am I supposed to do? They're comfort dogs.
I don’t think I have the concentration for this job. Let’s go chase a ball and get something to eat
It's not so bad? Employee of the month is now who's a good boy.
I don't know? They just logged in and the beagle mix with the glasses said that Red Rover sent them over.
This is my first campaign office where I can't hear the whistles.
No Jerry, I don't think a mailman Halloween costume is a good idea.
So these dogs understand Mandarin AND Goat?
The Goat is sexting me!
I'm just afraid they'll figure out their unconditional love was not worth it.
Anne from marketing is a real bitch!
I’m not going to Petco again for lunch!
We're no longer allowed to share cat memes.
They're all googling the meaning of "humane".
They're threatening to unionize because of carpal paw syndrome
Between A.I. and these guys, we don't have much time left.
I’m not working for kibble, you know what I’m saying?
The CEO's pet project is getting way out of hand!
I didn't think this is what they meant when they said this was a pet-friendly work environment.
I told you telemarketing is a dog eat dog world.
How did you understand “bring your pets to work”?
When they hired me I thought they asked if I knew DOS not DOG.
Is it me, or has this place gone to the dogs?
The oddest thing? Nothing but cat videos.
They said they would be good at sniffing things out! What?
Is it me, or is this place going to the dogs?
I think the boss is racist, in all the time I've worked here he's never once hired a cat!
There are no good lunches to steal anymore.
well, on the internet, no one knows you are a dog...
They keep hanging up on me because of my accent.
They seem relaxed now, but wait ‘til you see the corporate softball games.
Did you take my chew toy?
Watch what you say. I heard she’s a real bitch.
I'm just saying, how can I ask for a raise when my colleagues are being paid in kibble, Milkbones®️ and squeeky toys?
They could at least pick up after themselves.
Who the hell taught them to write code?
And I thought we were being replaced by robots.
I thought monkeys were the only animals that could write code.
It's a good place to get work done, but you might want to avoid cat videos.
I don’t know that command. You’d better ask someone else.
On the internet, nobody knows I'm an attractive woman.
I don't know who designed this new program, but I can't hear a thing.
I guess they have a nose for it....
This isn't the SAT exam?
When they said training day, this is not what I had in mind
Management has really gone to the dogs.
Who’s a good boy?” Please. He does nothing but play online poker all day
I’m tired of working like a dog.
The syllabus said Animal Science Lab!
K-911? Well, that sure explains a lot.
This customer just keeps barking at me.
When you said the internet had gone to the dogs, I thought you were talking about trolling.
Does that mean they're sub-woofers?
And all along, I thought you were the top dog!
I really have a bone to pick with these guys.
No, they’re anthropomorphology majors.
And they never go for walks - they just  post pictures of sticks on Instagram for their owners.
How are we supposed to compete with employees that are only getting paid with belly rubs?
See what happens when they started bring your pets to work day.
Your’re right. This place has really gone to the dogs!!
Seriously, who called in the dogs?
Hey, try throwing the ball.
The small one humped my leg. #MeShihTzu.
She’s a real bitch
Okay, this therapy animal thing is going too far...
Donald Trump called me a Dog on twitter and now this is the only place that will hire me!
Look, I'm all for a dog-friendly workplace but this has gone too far.
We just received an update e-mail from the hospital.  Mary had a lamb.  Its little, a bit under 5 pounds.
I go to the vending machine – all the trail mix has been replaced with kibble.
It's not fair. WE don't get to bring toys or eat at our desks!
Everyone's worried about automation, but they keep ignoring the real problem.
Who logged the dogs out? Woof, Woof, Woof!
I can't get any work done with his heavy breathing and panting!
I know we've replacing the foreign call center but we still cant understand  a word they say.
Happy 'Take Your Human to Work Day.'
Did you bring the cat?
You're not going to make it here unless you like cat videos.
It's fine to be pet friendly, but I won't keep fixing his code.
OK, I'm being a little dogmatic.
I guess this is what they meant by a dog friendly internet cafe.  Who knew?
His glasses aren't fooling anyone.
Buster won't stop asking me to take him on a W-A-L-K.
The men's room is down the hall -- the one with a dog on three legs.
We're toast. They earn a fraction of our salary.
The boss says they'll work for kibble!
This is the third time this week Rover came into work with fleas.
The network can't be fetched right now.
... and because they're loyal.
Last week my commission was a biscuit.
I did hear that Comfort Dogs get special training.
If you don't spell W-A-L-K, they go nuts and want to come with.
The staff meeting won't be starting until we hear the whistle.
Now I know why they put up that sign 'Warning: Dog Bytes.'
When they said we'll be employing AI, I though it meant Artificial Intelligence, not Animal Intelligence!
We're getting a lot of complaints about our customers not understanding our foreign accents!
It's put your dog to work day.
Best of all, our kibble breaks make me feel so much perkier than the old donuts and coffee.
The evidence is not sufficient to establish who's a good boy.
Why does everyone here keep asking us to go on a walk with them?
This open seating plan stinks even worse when it rains.
I hear they all went to M.U.T.
They couldn't be satisfied teaching them to sit, fetch, roll over, Oh no!
So much for a dog-friendly office
See?  I told you "woof" was a terrible password.
Rex makes a solid argument, the sign says “Dogs Allowed”!
One more debate over kibble brands in the break room and I quit.
How can they tell it’s not a dog online?
It is someone from India asking for assistance and say they cannot understand me
It's just harder for women in this industry. They're not my best friends.
I don't mind the work; I do mind the kibble.
Give the new team a chance, I hear they have subwoofers
I looked it up.  Mr. Snuffles isn't even in the working dog group.
No one knows your a human online!
Something went VERY wrong in the interviews.
The bad news is his breath is terrible. The good news is I can’t hear anything he’s listening to.
I told you, no, I don’t know how they use the spacebar!
Nobody actually reads these captions. They're all picked by a robot. That's why the winner is never really funny.
There are white collars, blue collars, and now... dog collars?
They may have fleas, but their code is bug-free.
I'm thinking we may have taken affirmative action a step too far.
What's with these bitches...?
It’s true:  This place has gone to the dogs.
I should never have taught them how to use this ancestry website.
I'm embarrassed that they can do it and I can't!
Hope you're happy now that they took you up on your "Take Your Dog to Work."
That’s it! No more Take Your Dog to Work Day.
Frank, the one next to me just friended me on Facebook.
What next?! Bring your kid to work day??
What bugs me is that they never gossip
Whistling isn't going to help anything.
Well, I hear panting.
The chief must have misheard me. I said we needed to pause this research.
Do you think they are getting paid more than us?
I think our days are numbered.
The boss must have heard me when I said this job is so easy my dog could do it!
They might be ok with the boss barking orders...
Honestly, I feel like management has us chasing our tails on these reports
No, I didn't bring my dog to work.  Did you?
Human Resources says they can't do anything about it.
This is not what I thought "bring your pet to work day"  meant.
I hope the bark isn't worse than the byte
I hear the new supervisor is a real S.O.B.?
Number of Instagram followers just can't be our hiring criteria anymore!"
Now they even have online obedience school!
Hey, why don't we sneak out and go fetch a stick or something.
"Shouldn't our equal-opportunity-hiring policy include cats?"
I’m all for equal pay, but I never thought they’d count experience in dog years.
No, he's not cute.  He's creepy.  He put his paws on my shoulders and licked the back of my head!
I not sure but I think our days are numbered now that the head of HR is a veterinarian.
We hired them to filter the dog-whistle content.
...and they get overtime every day too because they’re paid in ‘dog hours’.
Who's a good boy?" When did that become my job
It all started with "bring your kid to work" day.
So have you changed your mind about equal pay fior equal work?.
Doggone it, Stan, I think we're being phased out.
Yo, I saw Jim licking his weiner.
Do you think other family businesses operate like ours?
The smaller dogs complained about the standing desks.
Let’s face it; dogs are taking over desk jobs because they’re better at sitting on command.
We write the software, they write the manuals.
What were you thinking for lunch, Kibbles or bits?
These guys work like dogs.
'I can work with anybody, but have you seen what they put in the vending machines?"
Did your parents tell you that obedience school had a written exam?
I am confused about affirmative action.
He mentioned something about “Mating apps.”
How much is that doggie in the window earning?
One of them just told me to get off Facebook.
This is all because I said they are working us like dogs.
At least he shares his snacks with you. This one almost bit my hand off!
This is not what I had in mind when they said "diverse work environment."
I don't get it - she has more followers than me!
I hear there's kibble in the break room.
We shouldn’t have sneaked in here.   Who knew the test to get a dog license is so hard?!
Yesterday management admonished me for using the wrong gender neutral pronoun.
The secret pact is never to reveal they don't know how to read.
I think I might quit if they don't throw me a bone soon.
I think I screwed up. The Internet just figured out I wasn't a dog.
I think we're in the wrong library..
To buy on Amazon it says, 'Fetch now.'
Dude, that bitch is always eating at her desk.
My new foreign language teacher is a German Shepherd!
No one is brining me treats and telling me that I'm a "good girl".
I'm worried about my job...they literally rubbed my nose in my performance review!
Human friendly office, my ass!
I don’t mind working with animals and the satyr guy, but the dog with glasses is just such a pretentious snob.
The Coding Farm was bad, but my butt was never sniffed.
I have a bone to pick with the hiring practices at this company.

The one next to me’s looking at porn. Weird stuff.
My friend warned me that they work you like a dog here!
Have you even been trained?
Wow, free WiFi at Pet Smart, who knew?
I told you this place was going to the dogs!
I can hardly ever get him to go for a walk anymore.
Whatever you do, don’t call them ‘code monkeys.’
Is it still catfishing if they're dogs?
On the Internet no one knows you're a human being.
All friggin' day long its cat videos.
HR says it's not their problem.
Just put your lunch bag in the breakroom fridge. Dogs can't open refrigerators.
Well, what did you expect from a company named the Big Woof?
Who put in our budget twenty packs of rawhide and a grooming service?
I told you we weren't right for the dog food recall hotline.

I’m so tired of training new bitches
Robocalling didn't work so now they're trying Rover-calling
I know I'm supposed to say they're all good boys, but honestly, I have to debug all of Sparky's code.
AI is threatening, but at least it doesn’t have fleas
I had my doubts, but they're kicking tail over there.
By the smell of it, they've marked this department as their own.
They do make me feel like one of the pack.  Until the howling starts.
I've been here for three years now and my friends laugh when I describe this place as going to the dogs"
I guess I'm not the only teacher's pet anymore.
Forget Flight 2203, it's your turn to retrieve the ball!

no rest rooms. just a dog park.
They said it was a bulldog market.
They got bored playing frisbee.
If you're so critical of interspecies speed dating, why are you here?
At this company, they actually reward you for barking at the customers.
Before Jim quit last month, he did warn us that we'd end up working like dogs if we stayed here.
Psst! I got this sudden urge to go outside and chase a stick.
It' the boss's pet project right now, we have to suck it up.
On the internet, the dogs don't know you're a human.
But they are being too dogmatic!
They don’t know they’re dogs.
Seriously Jeff, you can’t blame it on the dogs all the time.
Since when has company policy allowed technical support pets?
Google "arf" for me, would you?

What part of "hire homo sapiens" did you not understand?
Princess had a litter, Jack, five kittens. I'm taking her place.
I heard Spot got the promotion. Rover is going to be devastated.
So this is the 'diversity' that HR was talking about?
Stop barking orders at me!
Yeah really, if they are service animals then where are the owners.
This bring your dog to work thing has gone too far.
An absence of cats doesn't prove that dogs are smarter.
All they listen to is "Who Let the Dogs Out"
It all started with that New Yorker cartoon.
How come nobody throws me the ball?

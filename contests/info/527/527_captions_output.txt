Deal. You don't tell anyone we're illegal aliens; we don't tell anyone you grow GMO corn.
Well, there goes that Wall idea...
Take me to your litter.
Say, you think you could switch off the lights so Mae and I could get some rest?
I am being serious, Trump's our leader.
This way to Canada?
It works as a parental lock for both Netflix and Xenu.
Hi there, are there any cows here? I swear I just saw one go over the moon.
Despite what you've been told, not all aliens speak Spanish.
We want to talk to you about farm-to-Mars.
I got candy
No, we don't do that any more.
Did you really think you could build a wall to keep us out?
Take me to your feeder.
We're not here to takeover over earth, just to take part in your presidential election.
The only thing I'm here to probe is your country's fascination for a candidate who wants to keep out aliens.
To us, everywhere is 'flyover country'.
The last thing I remember is shopping at Costco.
And you've only had clear liquids for the past 24 hours, correct?
No, really! WE are going to serve FOOD to YOU!
We need you to stop growing genetically modified crops.
Could I borrow 200 grams of C12H22O11?
Congratulations, you have just won the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes!
We've come down to witness the Trump campaign for ourselves
Leave quickly before Trump tries to build a wall around you too.
Hello again, Fred. And how's Stumpy, that delicious wife of yours ?
Take me to your leader. No, not that one. No, not that one. No, definitely not that one. Heck, is that Carter guy still around?
"Alien" has negative connotations. We prefer crop circle specialists.
Thanks for all the crops circles, sorry for the delay
Picked, farm fresh!
Got time for a drink?
May I interest you in Uber-plus?
Yeah, I sell dilithium crystals. I just need a place to stay tonight. Say, is that your daughter I saw in the window?

Let me start by telling you the difference between term and whole life insurance.
We would like your insight on the Kanye vs. Swift fued.

Greetings! We were exepcting you For dinner.
Wife says we're out of sugar.
Illegal is an alien term.
Hey, did you ever hear the one about the alien and the farmer?
That was, without question, my most unique Grindr experience ever.
'Greetings! We have observed that you are the one truly intelligent being on this planet.'
Farm-to-table cookbook? Ha! No, we're here to try and seduce your daughter.
I noticed you are growing High-amylose Class V corn. I hope you are getting a decent premium.
So that's it, then. Jimmy takes a nap around 4. Spaghetti is Jane's favorite. Any questions, you have my number. I'll expect final payment on the 15th. Good luck!

What took you so long? I drew that crop circle when Brownback became Governor of Kansas. I was hoping to leave before he mucked things up.
We are here to serve you-we just need some of your potatoes.
I am holier-than-thou.
Would you like to watch a 30-minute video about a time-share opportunity?
Sorry about the crop circles.
Is this Idaho, Ohio, or Iowa?

Last time you came for the Mrs. How is she by the way?
Does this mean that I don't have to pretend to like corn anymore?
'I'm guessing you've not flown with us before?'
Welcome aboard. The luxury cruise you won will begin right after a brief time-share information presentation.

We wish to learn more this government subsidy you exist on.
Greetings, Earthling. We have Shoofly pie!

I've always heard about southern grits.
No, we haven't heard the good news.
And if you are ever in the neighborhood of Venus, stop by and I'll reciprocate the hospitality.

Do you know how to grow potatoes?
Funny, we too are serving mankind!
Can you tell me how to get to the nearest Walmart?

Do you have a reservation?
Please tell me about your cell phone plan.
Thanks pal, it's an amazing maize maze!

Thank you, all the other spots were taken.
Yes, we are here to serve you, but you would have tasted better with the corn and beans we requested.
I wonder why he is landing here, wait why is he taking the farmer away and what is he going to do to him?!

Howdy friend. We have warm nuts and a hot towel waiting for you.
The old farmer with the pitchfork and his wife? You betcha! They live in that house yonder, right across the field.
You left your tractor high beams on.
This is an attempt to collect a debt, any information provided will be used for that purpose.

We learned everything about you from Facebook; the probing was just for me.
Don't worry--after the election illegal aliens won't want to be here.

Should I check, “exceeded expectations?”
Let’s just give him the damn cheese.
Hmmmmm, we didn’t count on his thinking above the box.
'What's more impressive is he's already filed the patent.'
Oddly, this one got the placebo.
He doesn't just find the cheese, he offers same-day delivery.
He also submitted a resume for your job.
It appears that his 'fight or flight' response has evolved.
Maybe we should start with a smaller dose.
I hurt his feelings last week when I told him this wasn't rocket science.
We're going to need another grant
Rat maze navigation trial 14: Animal failed to follow simple instructions.
Do you suppose they’ve been toying with us all these years?
I'll bet HE could build a better mousetrap.
He calls it a "Rat Pack"
She’s smart. Looks like we’ll need the glass ceiling.
Yes, that's cool.  But it's not statistically significant.
He flies and poops everywhere. Essentially, we've created a pigeon.
He also left us a tiny note with suggested revisions to our experimental design.
Now he's just showing off. He doesn't even like Swiss.
No, I said I'd marry you when pigs fly.
I'm going with 'Above Average'.
It appears that someone has been using old copies of Popular Mechanics to line the cages.
Should we call the Pentagon or Disney?
Meanwhile the guy with the MAGA hat in the human-size maze is still bumping into the first wall.
...I think we should probably go check on the dolphins.
Actually, the really smart ones just stay in their cages and use drones to get the cheese.
It's just a pilot study.
The "Failed to navigate the maze" checkbox doesn't seem adequate.
He got his own funding.
Is this the batch we got from MIT?
...I’m more impressed that he thought to make a helmet
We call him Elon Mousk.
What's really impressive, his degree is Art History.
Unfortunately, the drug is supposed to treat erectile disfunction.
Well, he's certainly thinking outside the box.
He had helicopter parents.
I'm not worried. The cats are developing ground to air missiles.
Interesting, we didn't see these results with Kraft Singles.
if he won't run the maze, how will we judge his intelligence?
That explains his expense report.
Interesting. Most in the control group simply hailed an Uber.
That, and he filed a flight plan.
This may skew our findings.
I've already got tenure. You write this up.
Did he just say “fuck your cheese, I’m out”?
Ok, not bad, but let’s see if he can stick the landing.
That's amazing.  Let's dissect him.
I think the engineering department is screwing with us again.
Apparently you can win the rat race.
Even stranger is that he got the placebo.
Okay, we have to remove their Internet access.
Once we switched to the smoked Gouda, they really started getting creative.
If he gets the Nobel, he has to share it with us, right?
How can we determine his intelligence if he keeps cheating on the test?
Well, there goes our bell curve.
I don't think 'Meets Expectations' quite covers it.
I think we'll call this one a 'statistical outlier.'
Well, that's going to skew the results.
Always the short cut with this one.
By all accounts he excels at reaching the cheese but continually fails to pair the suitable wine.
I upped the dose a bit.
I'll have what he had.
The jet pack's one thing, but does he have to sing, 'Here I come to save the day!' every time?
Call it cheating if you like, but I say he hit it out of the park.
Well, technically he failed the test.
This is going to make the Russian mouse furious.
Remember how I told you it would be obvious when it is time to retire?
Think we can get away with just listing this under "possible side effects?"
I am pretty sure he just said “OK Boomer”.
Don't know about you, but the genetically modified mice scare me.
What was our hypothesis again?
Forget the scientific journal, we’ve got to get this on Instagram.
The peer review is gonna be brutal.
Let’s rate this one as a high achiever with good altitude.”
I'm afraid he wants to be mentioned as co-author.
Tell those clods over in feline we're ready.
Doesn't follow the rules. Possible signs of ADHD"
He's a flight risk.
These little guys will be delivering packages for Amazon in no time!
Think of all the paperwork. I say we kill him right now, replace him with another mouse and never say a word about this.
Put him down as a cheese wiz
I guess it IS rocket science
I knew something was up when he had us count down from ten.
This new generation of mice doesn't understand hard work.
Part drone. Part rat. It's a drat.
He's a rat and a cheat.
He heard they put Gruyere in the maze next door.
Looks like, while the cat's away, the mice will study advanced engineering.
Exhibits inability to understand maze exercise
Don't feel discouraged if the mouse gets a PhD before you do
Yet he still poops on the floor.
He left a note saying he rejects our premise.
Just mark it down as, "Did not reach the cheese."
Last week I took its drone away, and now this.
Don't let the pigs see this
Well, man had a good run.
I don’t think this is one of ours.  This looks like a Musk rat.
I think I know who made those charges on our credit card.
Close the window.
How many genes did you say we altered?
Motor skills appear above average.
It would seem that the CBD with Red Bull has far exceeded our expectations.
I think he got a bigger grant than we did.
Don't get me wrong, this is incredible, but I think we lost track of the whole curing cancer thing somewhere along the way.
Of course he scores a zero. He failed to navigate the maze.
He’s overthinking it.
I suspect this will skew our previous results.
It was the only way we could get funding from Amazon.
Red Bull is definitely more effective than coffee.
Let's see if he can pick stocks.
Is it a bad time to mention that I forgot to label the mice?
I'm starting to think he doesn't even care about the cheese.
He must have been in that bunch of mice we got from MIT.
This totally ruins our thesis, you know.
I’ll go and check on the pigs.
This confirms our theory ....
He’s getting way more funding than we are”!
He'll hit the roof when he finds out it's vegan cheese.
Now I'm curious to see what he'd do for a Klondike Bar.
Elon, when do you want us to change you back?
I just hope God isn't a mouse.
He's no longer interested in the cheese. He's headed for the buffet.
Yes, but that wasn't the assignment.
I told you not to leave the Science Channel on all night.”
You should read his report on our observation techniques.
We should never have accepted that grant from Amazon.
Some mice look at things the way they are and ask why.
I warned you about letting them watch Ratatouille
It’s ok, he has a helmet.
He's learned how to cheat.  They're just like us now.
You do realize he is cheating?
Did it just say 'o.k., boomer'?
He spent his first month at Tesla’s research lab.
Do you want to tell him the moon isn't made of cheese?
Lazy....but brilliant.
And Professor Fletcher can't find his way back to his office after he goes to the bathroom.
I shouldn’t have asked the engineers to take over for me when I was sick.
I guess we should cancel the wheel trial.
Well this definitely proves it……Mice are definitely smarter then The Kardashians.
This explains why the espresso machine in the break room was torn apart.
We've invented the pigeon
That gives new meaning to the term, rat pack.
He's a Musk rat.
That's my DoD grant. Your NIH mice are behind me.
He's named it his Rat Pack.
To be fair, the cat is away.
I know he looks smart, but you should see what he posts on Twitter.
We should warn the snake lab.
He's just squeaking by. Let's see if he nails the landing.
You're the one who decided to use Popular Science as bedding
We should probably stop sampling the hallucinogens.
Oh, to be able to do that at IKEA.
Except for the implications for the future of human beings, it's great.
Perhaps we've been setting the bar too low.
...I was wondering what was in that tiny Prime box he had delivered to his cage!
Well obviously he's going to do better than the three blind one's.
If only all the side effects were this cool.
Just a smidge of testosterone and he’s already learned to showboat.
They left a note on my clipboard asking for dairy-free, soy-free cheese.
Are you sure you want to try it with apes next?
I think we underestimated the effect technology would have on Darwinism.
Amazing! but I think she's overqualified... and probably we can't sponsor her visa.
Our subways will never be the same!
I told you he was overqualified for the position.
It doesn't count until he lands.
Wait, were we supposed to build a better mouse, or a better mousetrap?
You're the one who used decided to use Popular Science as bedding
President Trump will be delighted to hear that his first Space Force trial is a success.
Remember when Mighty Mouse only needed a cape?
... let's report that we have observed a significant development of technical skills?
Good God we have a mouse that can think outside the box
This does not support our hypothesis.
Impressive but primitive in its reliance on fossil fuels.
That's also how they escape sinking ships.
I’m just going to mark it as inconclusive.
Imagine what he'd do for tenure.
Who knew, the cheese is the variable.
This is nothing. You should see what the monkeys are doing.
From Amazon, where else?
Well, it IS the Year of the Rat!
I guess good things do happen when you remove the glass ceiling!
There's probably no good time to tell you that Pinky here has been offered the directorship of the lab.
Cut the crap, Iggy, did you or did you not give him an extra dose?
We caught him at the Tesla factory.
Looks like it's time to build a better maze.
This isn't his first maze.
He could've bought tons of cheese with what he paid for that jetpack.
He says he's from google maps...
All this time, I thought WE would win the genius grant.
I’m getting apprehensive about the primate trials.
She’s now officially smarter than a politician"
He's testing us.”
I think we’ve found our winner.
Quick,  yes, but still not as quick as the mice who use Google Maps.
Sometimes I feel as though their lives are more interesting than mine.
Let's name this one MacGyver.
Are these the rats Tesla sent over?
I'm not sure this side effect qualifies as 'adverse.'
He heard the moon is made of cheese
I see why they call this the Year of the Rat.
The control group has a smaller carbon footprint.
Your right, he didn’t solve the maze, but you have to applaud his ingenuity.
Well, that explains what happened to the Buzz Lightyear doll that went missing from your desk.
They must have sent us one of those Elon Muskrats.
See what happens when you don't teach to the test?
Who left the 3D printer on?
It’s amazing what they’ll do for gourmet cheese.
Let me guess. Not the placebo?
Is this animal testing us?
Morning shift must have used extra sharp cheddar."
Either they're getting smarter or we've done this too often.
It's the new iMouse from Apple.
Didn't see that coming
I’m gonna mark that down as a ‘pass’.
Now let's see how long it takes him to pair it with the right wine.
I hate working with these millennials.
Those mice from the NASA labs are such show-offs
Technically, it didn't solve the maze.
'A' for effort, 'F' for fuel efficiency.
I don't care what you say-I'm recording a failure to complete the maze properly.
I wondered what it was 3D printing.
I’m more interested in where he got the fuel than how he made the jet pack.
And I say give him the damned cheese.
It's a shame we have to kill him.
I guess you can stop saying they lack initiative.
We might want to lower the dosage at bit...
We do have his signed consent form, right?
It appears the Evel Knievel gene splicing experiment is a success.
See, females are more creative!
If you don't mind me asking...how did you get him to wear the goggles?"
Smile. He hacked the lab's account and is live-streaming this flight.
Whoa, that one’s really thinking outside the box!
In his defense, we never read him the rules.
We call that one Elon Mousk.
Big deal. He copied the idea from a New Yorker cartoon.
But is it statistically significant?
We knew this day was coming: The rat race has produced better rats.
Are you sure that was the placebo?
We've had nothing but problems ever since he read 'Who Moved My Cheese?'
Maybe we can hire him.
Just write “Advanced problem-solving skills.”
Yeah, but he's just doing it for the Instagram likes.
We're in trouble...Didn't you say that was the dumb one?
Does he have an exit strategy?
And yet he still can't figure out this maze.
This one wrote ‘Epstein didn’t kill himself’ on the bottom of his cage.
And I’m calling it “the rat pack.”
You realize that if he succeeds, we're out of a job.
Let's wait to see the landing before we evaluate it's intelligence.
Is this a bad time to ask you out?
I think we are going to need to keep a lid on this.
So anyway, Martha and I are getting a divorce...
They just don't seem to delay gratification anymore.
Let's get him back in the cage before he develops a nuclear warhead.
A one in a billion fluke maybe, but I also just found a very small volume of Shakespeare in one of the other cages.
I told you not to give him an Amazon gift card for Christmas.
Are you sure this one is from the control group?
His name is Algernon. Why do you ask?
One small step for mousekind...
I think we just got skewed.
These millennial mice are ruining mazes.
Her Father tested for NASA.
I knew they could do it, but how did they get the funding?
Better than last week when he sent up a drone to find the exit
It must be an Elon Muskrat.
Weren't we doing something with cancer?
He already has a patent and has applied to our grad program.
Now do you believe me?
Is it always this easy to identify outliers?
Great. They have jetpacks and we still DON'T?
Nature or nurture?
That's thinking outside the box.
What are we testing for, again?
On the plus side, at least one of us will be getting tenure.
He's going to be so disappointed when he finds out what the moon is actually made of.
M-I-T P-h-D M-O-U-S-E.
He's still not getting tenure.
Let's check the dosage on that one.
He works here to fund his own research on string cheese theory.
Maybe he can program the clock on the microwave?
The mouse that soared.
We can bury this in the supplement.
So we give the jet packs out in the subway, and then put a giant piece of cheese in New Jersey...
I might have messed up the dosage.
Remember when we used to give the rats cocaine?
Well, that proves it. Brie will set you free.
NASA had him for awhile.
Houston, I think we have a problem.
The scary thing is that a cockroach taught him how to do it.
I feel less overqualified now.
The last time we used brie, and he actually had a little flamethrower.
Swiss appears to be more motivating than Halloumi.
I guess our work is done here.
Interesting. He picked the jet pack over the helicopter.
For this study I thought, "Give a rat some cheese and you feed him for a day, but give a rat a jetpack..."
You're impressed?  Well he hasn't got the cheese yet, has he?
Please tell me this isn't the placebo.
Your hypothesis "mechanization does not improve outcomes" is really being tested.
First day here in Los Alamos?
He seems overqualified for the job.
We could just reference this one in the footnotes.
It's that damn  Amazon Prime again.
This is why you shouldn’t get your mice from Cal Tech.
I'm calling him Elon Musk-Rat
Score this one high on ingenuity and low on perseverance.
I did think it was strange when he requested that tiny tool set.
I asked him how he calibrates weight versus thrust, and all he did was squeak.
Well, you're the one who taught her to read.
We probably shouldn't use the ones who went through STEM training.
I hope we’ve been nice to this one.
Five bucks says he can’t stick the landing
"I sense our experimental parameters have subtly shifted."
Such a shame, he just can't seem to find the cheese without cheating.
Any idea where he got those goggles?
In conclusion, rats these days don’t know the value of hard-earned cheese
A flying rat? Terry you just reinvented the pigeon.
Looks like we have an overacheeser.
Allowing roller skates was a slippery slope.
This is a game changer for cats too.
I think he's completed the pilot program.
I don’t think this is going to prove a damn thing.
My robotic mouse can beat your genetically modified rat.
He insists it is less about the cheese and more about getting a mouse on the moon.
I'd say it's progress. Just last week they were using stilts.
Should we try pigs next?
We’ll have to kill that one so our results look good.
I hate this fucking job.
Shall we move the cheese?
Are you sure this one got the placebo?
The weirdest thing is he still ran the maze, he's just toasting a brioche.
Year of the Rat is off to a great start.
Should we let the cat out of the bag?
Why weren't we warned he's a flight risk?
So, can we move on to human trials?
I knew it was a mistake to give them the Amazon password. .
Perhaps we should scale back the dosage just a little bit?
This is remarkable. Just three weeks ago he had to take an Uber.
Yes, he passes. I just wish he hadn't patented it.
I guess he passes.
He said  we’re irrelevant, is bored and is getting the hell out of here.
Yes, we do see some variation in natural ability.
Do you think he'll let us share credit on this?
Do we describe this as "innovative" or "cheating?"
I think the little bastards are getting smarter, don't you?
Did you ever feel like you're the one being experimented upon?
What hallucinogen are we testing today?
He wont do it unless we tell him what happened to Minnie.
I don't think we can launch the drug just yet.
It wouldn't bother me so much, but he keeps calling it the "Rat Pack."
This is what we get for letting them unionize.
I love you Sandra. I've always loved you.
I think he's earned the wine pairing.
wait till the subway rats get a hold of this
I still have to mark her maze run as incomplete.
I hope all they want is our cheese.
Stupid rat, can’t even solve a simple maze.
It says here he's called "Elon Mouske."
Maybe we should lock the tool box at night.
His funding is better than ours.
I see Acme's miniaturized its coyote jet pack
These millennial rats are so lazy.
Let's not tell anyone, okay?
Fortunately this is one of the least common side effects.
Ever since they heard the moon was made of cheese, our mouse-space program has really taken off.
He can build a jet-pack with his genetically engineered brain, but his highest aspiration is still yellow cheese."
I still say it’s cheating.
I'll just put 'inconclusive'
I believe he’s the one who torched our hamster wheel last month.
This is what happens when we don't give them explicit instructions.
Theoretically, that should not work.
It appears that our hypothesis was incorrect.
I think I've figured out who's been ordering the Cheese Lover's Pizzas online in the middle of the night.
Week 65: subject is displaying symptoms of a typical millennial and has decided to ruin the whole experiment
I'm still struggling to see the market for this drug.
I knew we shouldn't have named his mother Necessity.
We call it Susan Collins' Syndrome. Afraid to make a decision.
We had to give it to him as an accommodation but it's skewing the results.
I don't care how amazing it is, we'll still need to dissect its brain afterwards.
Also an elevated sense of self-importance.
The 'placebo effect' is remarkable.
Is this the one Elon sent us?
I see your research is taking off
Die Fledermaus
You gotta give it to him: thinking outside the box.
It's incredible, but he's still last.
His mother flew on the Space Shuttle.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a hat that small for a rat?
The mice are testing how long it will take you to learn your maze experiment isn’t working.
Well, it appears we've invented a pigeon.
That's what we get for breeding them with opposable thumbs.
At least he's wearing a helmet.
Look–he's using a tool.
It worries me that he's not interested in the cheese anymore.
I told you it was vulnerable to an airstrike.”
Definitely an outlier.
He’s pretty jazzed about that rat pack.
I think your findings should take into account 
the fact that he never actually found the cheese.
The real question is: How did they perfect jet-packs before we did?
You had him sign an updated liability waiver, right?
So, his exact words were, "Here I come to save the day?"
As your advisor, I must tell you that this experiment is fundamentally flawed.
Yes, but are the results reproducible?
Maybe he should be the one holding the clipboard?
Is that a pass or a fail?
We're going to need more grant money
No more joint experiments with the engineering department.
And just like that, Bubonic is airborne.
Now let's try the one without an Amazon account.
No more mice from the MIT gene lab.
I want what he’s taking.
That's going above and beyond.
Ok Trudy, NOW will you go out with me?
You DO realize we’ll NEVER be able to get this past peer review in any reputable journal?
Is it weird that I wish I was him?
This adds a whole new dimension to leaving the rat race.
You'd think he'd know how to land by now.
That's definitely a 'far exceeds expectations'.
Genetic engineering, Candace. Not mechanical engineering.
I'm just surprised he managed to put on the goggles.
Nancy took the kids. I've started drinking again.
He certainly upgraded from his pogo stick.
The NYC subway will never be the same again
Oh Edgar is smart enough, but he’s a maverick not a team player at all.”
He has better funding.
Can we just call this one an outlier?
Statistically? Not significant at all.
Don’t tell the pigs.
What happened to the three blind ones?
We're finding unexpected results with those on the 007 Diet.
The grant from SpaceX paid up.
Oh brother! I think that's 'Here I Come to Save the Day' he's humming."
So just YouTube? He wasn't allowed to visit any other site?
This one belongs to Elon Musk.
Just give him the cheese and move on.
Did he sign a waiver?
Which ehh, which box are you ticking for this?
He's innovating. Call Security.
We're definitely going to have to reexamine our assumptions.
Technically, he failed.
She says this whole cheese in the maze thing is beneath her.
Why WOULDN'T a rat need this, Karen?
Stop worrying. It'll never work outside of lab conditions.
AmazonMouse: because Alexa cannot bring you cheese.
Let's keep this to ourselves.
Well, that explains why he asked for a helmet.
Looks like our research has finally started to take off.
History may not be kind to us for this one.
We’re going to need a better maze
The cat has a helicopter.
.... that's all well and good, but I think he missed the point of the task.
We both knew this day would come.
It's really just a classic fight or flight response.
Explains why he never took to the wheel.
Maybe it was a mistake giving him a credit card.
What do you say we just give him the cheese?
I really thought we'd have jet packs before them.
I never thought I'd lose my job to automation.
I think we’re gonna need a better maze.
IQ off the charts.  Sucks as a pilot.
He really thinks outside the box!
He told me it will be "one giant leap for mousekind."
After all, you did get him from the aerospace lab!
It's innovation out of frustration. We did keep moving his cheese...
Pretty good. But the chipmunk works for peanuts.
Did we modify the gene for genius or for cheating?
He has taken the pilot project seriously!
It counts higher if he makes a fondue.
You realize the real bioethical issue is who owns the patent.
Imagine what he would have done for Havarti?
I guess it depends what you mean by "progress."
And this experiment was funded by Elon Musk.
I had no idea he had an Amazon account.
She became extraordinarily motivated after we switched to gruyere...
You think that’s cool, you should check out the cat and the litter box next door.
I didn't anticipate he'd skip right over Pavlov and go straight to drone technology.
Do you think he’d take a selfie with me?
Let's try giving him a typewriter next.
If you want to build a better mousetrap, you need a better mouse.
This will really skew the results.
This is what happens when you take away little Stuart's plane.
Yeah, but we're testing how fast they can get t͟h͟r͟o͟u͟g͟h͟ the maze.
So I said of course we’ll get different results with mice from France. But did they listen?
Where’d he get the goggles?
Should we report this as a potential side effect?
I'm not sure the CBD infused Swiss was such a great idea.
He also wants crackers and fig jam...not an unreasonable request.
He feels cheese is beneath him.
Maybe we should do the human testing first.
I think we can check improves mental acuity.
We are going to need a three dimensional maze.
That’s why we named him Elon Muskrat.
They never cease to amaze and then they actually cease to a maze.
That's a pass...right?
His  union rep called.  The contract calls for Gruyere, not Swiss.
I had a feeling upgrading to the aged Asiago would skew the results
One small flight for a mouse; one giant flight for mousekind!
Forget about the maze.  He flew over and ate my lunch.
He keeps complaining that we moved his cheese.
Well, now we know what happens when we make him listen to Elton John non-stop.
In mouse years, I'm afraid he's a Millennial.
It sounds like he’s singing, Here I come to save the day.
But can he land it.
That's what happens when you line the cage with DIY magazines..
She wants Tuesday night off for a MENSA meeting.
This one definitely shows signs of learning.
"He thinks he's outsmarting us, but we're actually testing the effect of cheese on his cholesterol.
It is really good cheese.
Another failed intelligence test...the cheese is right there, dumb dumb!
I was worried about those small Amazon deliveries.
NASA thinks that if we tell him that the moon is made of cheese that he'll help with the rocket.
Did he get the drug or the placebo?
He's applying for Trumps space force when he finishes here.
They've been watching a lot of  YouTube videos.
He built a better mousepack.
The real question is where did he find those tiny goggles?
Is this the mouse we got from the Cal Tech lab ?
Tell the President they're ready...
‘Mondays, am I right?
I'll lock the door.
We've got his family. He won't go rogue.
Can we agree that the experiment is inconclusive?
What did you feed him last night?
I'd say we have a new alpha.
How does she operate the jet pack without thumbs ?
Yeah, it really was a rocket science.
The last one used Amazon Prime.
We got him from NASA, and nobody checked what else came in the box!
I hate it when the mice are smarter than we are.
his dad was a Harvard lab rat
Still didn’t find the cheese in the maze.
I think this one is from the NASA lab upstairs.
He's not just thinking outside the box. He's headed for the window.
Well, if you give a mouse a jet-pack...
The subject seems to have..ascended.
So, pass or fail on the maze test?
You’re right. Five doses is too much.
We're still using the 2019 maze for the 2020 rat.
At least he's not vaping anymore.
I think he was expecting Gruyere.
Do we need to add this to the list of side effects?
His name is Rat...James Rat.
Well, he IS the fastest, but we really can’t record that because he is obviously cheating.
I never thought about a roof did you?
My theory is that our readers will be tracing the maze with their fingers and they'll fail to come up with a caption about a flying rat.
We should never have let him watch those Macgyver reruns.”
What's really impressive is his use of eco-friendly, cheese-based rocket fuel.
Maybe we’re not using the right cheese.
If he wasn’t just hovering in the same spot for 20 minutes I might have been impressed.
They gave the grant directly to the rats.
He learned how to build it on YouTube.
The problem is the exhaust always melts the cheese.
And this is why we have cats with hang-gliders.
What's the protocol for this?
He is taking a “Rat Pack “ to a higher level..
You know we’re going to have to falsify the data, right?
High achiever?
If you didn’t just sing “Here I come to save the day!”, who did??
You can blame Marvel Comics for this
While she scored highly for completion - we have to mark her down for failure to follow instructions
His nickname is Cheese Whiz
We might have to revisit that hypothesis
Why do we even bother to test these mice raised at NASA?
We might have underestimated our intelligence.
I didn't realize little helmets like that were even available.
When you switched to the Limburger, all hell broke loose.
So... Points for style?
I'm even more impressed that he ordered it from Amazon.
I'll give him an A for effort.
They seem to be evolving more quickly than anticipated.
I still think giving him all of Jeff's adderall was a bad move.
I'm sorry I doubted your jet-pack theory.
Enough tests. I’m taking some right now.
Ooops, one of Elon's.
Think of how much exercise the cats will get!
Maybe we should have tried a half dose
Now if we could only get him over his fear of flying.
It's an impressive result... but is it statistically significant?
Wait, this one is from the control group?!
I told you the maze needs a roof. And you said "No it doesn't. It's not like mice can fly,"
Is this mouse number 007?
Didn't I say not to use the good cheese?
so, we didn’t anticipate that...
It's not that impressive, we gave him the parts to make a teleporter.
We gave him a cookie, he asked for milk, yadda yadda, he's got a jet pack now.
Now he's just showing off.
Forget science journals. We should go for a TED Talk.
For all intents and purposes, he is now a pigeon.
So much for the plan to develop a better mousetrap
This is the same one that built the remote control in the Skinner box.
It seems the time has come to lay out some ground rules.
No more rats from the AI lab.
I guess you could say he built a better jet pack.
Impressive, yes. But can he stick the landing
I would say the hand cream has no harmful side effects
He’ll get it when he runs out of fuel.
I'm going to mark this down as a "Partial Success".
Yes, but have we cured its erectile dysfunction?
We're hesitant to acknowledge his accomplishments lest he start looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
The one with the jetpack clearly seems faster.
Seems a bit complicated for a yes/no decision, doesn't it?
Mighty Mouse 2.0 is amazing.
I’ll put him down as an outlier.
Now, we just have to change their image, and they'll be delivering packages all over New York.
No, we intend to learn what motivates the government to fund these experiments
My question is, where did she get that tiny helmet?
The really smart mice produced their own cheese instead of building jetpacks
I can’t decide if I’m in awe or terrified.
Sigh... Another failure to navigate the maze.
But where's the progress if he can't land?
He’s not so smart. The door to the lab is locked.
It works great, I’m just concerned about his carbon pawprint.
Perhaps we should rethink the variables.
Is that the lactose intolerant one?
But how's his erectile dysfunction?
I was wondering who put in the requisition for jet fuel.
Six years at Stamford. Top my class. Think this mouse gives a shit?
There goes our best-laid plan, Dr. Steinbeck.
Did I tell you he got a package from Amazon?
This is the one who thinks he's a bat.
It’s the only way we can keep our funding from the Pentagon.
I think I know who rigged that little treadmill to power the entire building.
An outside the box solution.
Well...his times ARE faster...
It seems the subject got a hold of my Red Bull
Hmmm   Subject noncompliant.
I'll show you the chimps after lunch.
That’s one way to beat the rat race.
Make sure that one doesn’t get out of the lab!
He's been impossible ever since we told him that this is the Year of the Rat.
He finds the iPhone in 12 seconds.  But with the cheese he won't even try.
It IS the year of the rat!
That’s the fourth one this week. Maybe we should switch to brie.
That’s cheating, right?
Dumb rat -- can't read the rules.
Do you think the maze is obsolete?
Well, so much for evolution.
Results are conclusive: the walls aren't a deterrent.
Well, that was unexpected.
Guess who just won the Nobel Prize for Physics?
I'd bet his parents paid a consultant 50K to cheat the test.
He wanted to rise above the rat race.
Well, let's just see how he lands it.
He's just acting cocky now.
He used to work at NASA.
Family money.
Well, it is 2020.
Don’t get excited, the engine appears to be powered fossil fuels.
That must be #3, Elon Mouse.
Wow. Just wait 'til our peers review this.
I don't have a column on my report for this one
Looks like your genetic engineering experiment really took off!
That's Elon Mousek!
Imagine what he’d do for an opioid.
This is what happens when you don't own your data.
Apparently Petsmart sells them.
I think we have a mole in our lab.
I'm recording this as "failed to complete the maze".
Technically, it’s illegal, but there’s no precedent
Will he use sight, smell, or GPS?
so much for that $21.6 billion wall
It looks like we have a new lab assistant.
It's his resignation letter.  He's going to be a stunt double for Disney.
Her CV does mention that she used to test for NASA.
We need to stop letting Acme Industries fund our research.
I don't like that we have to share this lab with the engineering department.
Well, we didn’t specify HOW she gets to the cheese.
Do you think we can get a publication out of this?
Building a better mousetrap is the least of my worries.
If you think that’s something, wait until we uncork the Bordeaux.
Would you rate it as 'success' or 'failure'?
It's not because he's white.
This is the annoying one
Before we can draw our conclusions, we need to get a list of all the movies that were shown at the cinema multiplex where we trapped him.
Do you think it can find a way to get us out of here?
I was certain it would pick the flying car.
I smell a rat.
1980 called. They want their rat maze back.
Safe to say he didn't get the placebo.
He's giving it his all. Can't we do better than a three month-aged cheddar?
We did tell him to think outside the box.
I suppose it's just possible that he's on the way to save the day.
Looks like he is one Tedtalk away from world domination.
There go our best-laid plans.
Build a better maze.
I told him it was artisanal.
This one's from the E.B. White batch.
He’ll keep quiet if we make him co-author of the published study.
But can he dance?
...and the only new variable is that he started reading sheets from The New Yorker on the bottom of his cage?
Impressive results, the control group haven't advanced beyond hoverboards.
So this counts as completing the maze, right?
We didn't foresee this when we borrowed him from the NASA lab.
She probably saw it on YouTube.
If he hovers and toasts it, I’m quitting.
I'm so sick of proving rats are smarter then I am.
Let's see how he does with the flying cat.
We might not get this in Nature, but what about Popular Mechanics?
He won't touch it now that he's a vegan.
You said its name was Elon Muskrat?
And here we have Lab Mouse number 007.
Poor little thing, do you think he knows he's a guinea pig?
Must be the Tang."
What did you put in the cheese?
What say? Time to buy shares of that brain boosting supplement maker?
Last time I borrow a lab rat from NASA.
First,  close the windows.  Then call the Pentagon!
Don't worry: "Mice Can Cheat" is a fine conclusion."
You used the engineering manual to bed the cage, didn't you?
If he’s that smart, you’d think he’d just make his own cheese.
I mean, I'd be more impressed if it was hydroelectric.
Let's put this one in the tobacco study.
I feel oddly shaken, but not stirred.
Sure it's impressive, but why's he still here?
You'd really think he'd just leave.
I'm starting to feel like they're winning.
So he cheats! Doesn't that mean he's even smarter?
Who says rats aren't exactly rocket scientists?
Brings a whole new meaning to "Rat Pack," doesn't it?
So amphetamines do give them a lift
He said he’s tired of the rat race.
She said she needed space
This is nothing. Yesterday he was spotted in Wisconsin.
This skews everything.
We may have to separate him from the others.
Best time yet
Now, let’s see if he can stick the landing.
We could just hand it to him.
So are we hypothesizing the intelligence of mice or the quality of the cheese?
I have my doubts about peer review.
But can he teach his methodology to others?
Man, my cat is going to be pissed when he hears that I started this.
So your biggest concern is that each mouse gets a jetpack rather than where this one came from?
He's taking all the fun out this.
You must write very good grant proposals.
Iran won't know what hit them.
Is he allowed to do that?
Whoa, disruptive!
I wonder what will happen when we get to the pigs.
Why does he get a jet pack and I have to take the subway to work?
Impressive, yes, but still hasn't mastered landings
What do you think, NSF or FAA?
Algernon is getting good at this.
It's not really in the spirit of the game, is it?
I think he’s beyond cheese.
let's walk back the hormone experiments
That's one giant leap for micekind!
okay zoomer
I think our species is in trouble"
Does your clipboard have a box for that?
This is what happens when you bring out the good cheese
You can always tell the mice from NASA
I follow him on Instagram
Better than last week with the pole vaulting.
I suggest we falsify the data.
Well, you know what they say about the best-laid schemes of mice and men...
We'll need to observe his social visits from friends and family members more closely.
End the research; jetpacks are not in our grant funding.
Mark this one down as an outlier.
We never should have given him an Amazon account.
It appears to be a 21st Century mouse vs. a 20th Century maze
Yeah, but it’s still cheating.
Sure he set a new record for running the maze, but he didn't follow the rules so we'll have to consider the drug a failure.
He has a masters from MIT.
This one must be getting help from the outside
I would dial the dose back a touch. For our sake.
Well he’s out, you know the rules..... no helmets.
I think it's safe to say he's our alpha.
He works for Amazon.
Mark it invalid - he's outside trial parameters.
Next time let's just use the mice from MIT to feed the snakes.
Good thing the animal rights people have been too busy with climate change.
I thought Red Bull was supposed to give them wings
I didn't even see her put it on.
The strangest part is he's only the control group
They’ll never convince me that genetically modified mice don’t skew results.
While I admire the innovation, I don't see how this will help.  He's still a blind mouse.
The experiment was a success, the humans suspect nothing
we're gonna need more cheese"
What do you know, that Smartwater really works after all.
I worry that switching to the Emmenthaler may have skewed the results.
Are we counting the six weeks it took him to build that?
Well, it looks like Amazon has scaled back on their drone delivery expectations “.
I bet you didn’t see that coming.
I knew we shouldn't of accepted these free mice from NASA.
So that's what happens if you give it a cookie
That’s nothing—he built a portal gun to get to the smoked Gouda.
I wonder what else he got for Christmas.
Let's just say this data point should be excluded and move on.
Maybe the gene therapy was a little too effective.
I'd say that intelligence gene modification was a success!
If you give a mouse a jetpack...
My bad....I taught Alexa to speak mouse.
I like to remember simpler times.
He thinks this is a "Micky Mouse" operation.
Did I win?
Does he know the prize is just a piece of cheese?
Millennial.
If they still don't believe in evolution after this, we should give up.
Five points off for environmental impact.
0932 fails the maze, but his coolness is off the charts.
I knew those JPL lab rats were gonna be a problem.
I got tired of watching them just walk through the maze.
You forgot his water bottle.
This is the one doing intermittent fasting?
I haven't seen him since he escaped from the maze and stole our mind enhancing drugs.
42; but I have no idea what that means.
So this is how the plague became airborne...
His name is Bond. Rat Bond.
With the time it took to get that thing on and fire up the jet pack, he’s actually slower than the other rats.
I told you cheese gives you gas!
We'll it's no flying pig, but I still didn't think I'd ever see this.
I asked for a vertical mouse for my computer.
You picked a lazy one. Put him back and grab a mouse that will run.
Very impressive but 407-b made a nice fondue so he gets my vote.
Trouble is, once he touches down, it’s the same old rat race again.
Exactly how does this help funding for Spaceforce?
Amid severe budget cuts, auditions for the next James Bond movie continued.
It's time to retire this one.  He's catching on to us.
Equally impressive is the fact that he built that from the water bottle.
Is he one of the lab rats we got form MIT?
Isn't he lactose intolerant?
You say he did this after how many attempts?
Okay, but I'm not impressed with his lateral thrust control.
Who are the rocket scientists now?!
It’s Elon Mousk
Can you double-check that this is the control group?
You need to control more variables!
I told you-engineers don't understand behavioral research!
With all due respect to Sammy, Dean and Frank... let’s just call it The Rat Pack.
The good news for us is that a mouse can't be named on a patent.
The funny thing is, he doesn't even like cheese
She still has to stick the landing.
This is game changer.
We’re going to need a better mousetrap.
Now that's one giant leap for ratkind.
Maybe the test didn't really challenge the subject.
Let's just clock it at five seconds and call it a day.
What if he just grabs the cheese and goes?
Im thinking we should anesthetize the smart-ass. You?
This one's thinking outside the maze.
Ever since we introduced the VR app, none of the rats want to do the real maze.
So, where do you want to go for lunch?
He’s been working on his landing.
He will get the cheese before we get the grant
If we move fast, we can probably get a Netflix deal out of this.
I can hardly wait to section his brain!
I really don't think he's coming back.
I’m recording this result as an outlier.
Yes, he’s very clever, to but I still say it’s cheating.
Do are we to conclude that the mouse will  always choose the jet pack over the intellectual challenge of the maze?
The Mouse that Soared. Amazing!
I promise I told Amazon not to send Stuart Little
Looks like we finally have a cheese wiz we can be proud to serve.
They left a note that said they'd rather look for pizza in the subway.
First the movie Cats, now this.
These millennial rats get so bored with lever-pressing.
Is that for the Amazon contract?
well at least he’s wearing a helmet
I'm visualizing a Nobel Prize here but we may need to tweek the hypothesis.
It hardly seems fair to the others.
Oh, Mr. Musk is going to heart emoji this!
I knew we shouldn't have watched Mission Impossible in the lab!
Clearly he's the over-achiever
For me, this just underscores how amazing you look in that lab coat Cynthia.
Now that's what I call thinking outside the box!
Sure, the engineering is impressive, but it just goes to show he lacks a sense of direction.
Instinct, my ass!
You should see what the one with water-skis can do
I’m concerned that he’s one of the three blind ones.
We've moved beyond the classic maze to one of full immersion virtual reality. Unfortunately, it still wants the real cheese.
I don't think he got the point of the experiment."
How are we going to spin it this time...
If we need it, your cat's in your office, right?
That's.... amazing?
But Susan, would you say this is slightly more intelligent or greatly more intelligent?
One giant step for mousekind.
Maybe we'll get tenure if we pretend we invented it.
Brenda, I know you said when pigs fly, but...
Yeah well, he’s built these devices before. They look terrific but they never really work.
We need to update our paradigm.
Damn, even I didn't think of that.
Welp, the plague is airborne now
Her resume did specifically mention breaking through the glass ceiling.
I think their technology is more advanced than we thought.
Well, at least he didn’t use a GPS.
He's ahead in the ratrace.
They go to extremes for Gruyere.
He doesn't do cheddar.
We'll have to disqualify him for failure to follow rules.
Well, seems like a good time to break for lunch.
He thinks he can outsmart us, but the cheese is just a hologram.
Well yes, the learning curve is somewhat quicker than expected.
WOW! ...He applied what he learned!
Its a new Apple  mouse.  You tell them they got  the product request wrong?
Today's mice are not the same as the one's before the internet.
Do you reckon it'll be easier to get clearance from the FAA than from the FDA?
The one time your boss observes you...
His helicopter is in the shop again.
Guess we'll have to do a better job of hiding the cheese.
He’s not allowed to use that.
We’re going to have to allocate more of our budget to the cheese.
He deserves more than cheese.
She's always been a prodigy.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch that James Bond movie.
We gotta stop using mice from the engineering department.
It says her that one of the common side effects is 'Mighty Mouse Syndrome'.
And from now on, he'd like to be called 'Edam Musk'.
After all the training and student loans, it's come to this.
I think we'd better stop lining their cages with grant-proposal forms.
I spent two weeks building this maze!
I quit.
You give a mouse a cookie, he'll ask for a jet pack, I guess."
I swear, I was only gone for 10 minutes.
Well, that’s one small flight for mouse...
Say he doesn’t use it to get to the cheese, but uses it to take the cheese.  Then what?
Now let’s see if he can find the cheese.
He's a jetpackrat.
We'll be needing a lot more cheese from here on out.
Let's see them try to ban animal testing now.
Come on, jet packs always skew the test results.
I hate to say it’s stupid, but really... this is the 23rd time and it still cannot run the maze.
You're right; it's time to put a lid on it.
What is this Kobayashi Maru he keeps talking about?
Perhaps we shouldn't borrow mice from the Drone Lab anymore.
Cross out ED and put in "improves intelligence"
They never bothered to use the jet pack for the Stilton.
I knew it was a mistake to lend him out to the Jet Propulsion Lab !
The drug was originally developed as a cure for male pattern baldness, but marketing are quite excited about the possibilities.
She designed this maze, which looks remarkably like our lab complex.
That seals it.  I'm doubling my daily dose of B12.
There's no natural law against it.
Great. Now he'll want a share of our funding.
I think we stop using Marvel movie loops as our stimuli.
I think we’ve created a Muenster!
I know that gadget must have been expensive, but then he is a "prime" member so shipping was free.
Amazingly advanced?  Yes.  But also cheating.
He’s thinking outside of the box!
Why didn’t we put a top on it?
When he said he's over this whole maze thing.  I didn't understand what he meant.
Oh, that’s just Chuck E. Yeager.
Wait, I’m not giving him a Pass until he actually eats the cheese...
So imported cheese does make a difference?
Sure, he’s off the charts on the technical side, but it’s at the expense of his artistic merit score if you ask me.
Well, he did pay for the lab
I want to publish too, but will it pass peer review?”
Cheese, the great motivator.
My guess is that he’s a Musk-rat.
If it can't work out the maze route then we count it as another fail.
Another failure. Over ten minutes and it still isn't at the cheese.
Impressive, yes.  But he's completely ruining my dataset.
It started after we put the cheese on the top shelf.
He's been trained to think outside the box.
I read 70% of published results weren’t reproducible.
Just as I suspected.
I don't know. Maybe we should raise the height of the walls?
And that's zero points for delayed gratification!"
Did I ever tell you that Stuart Little was my first crush? I want to be scared but this is super sexually confusing for me.
Where do you suppose he got the rocket fuel ?
So Carol, what's for lunch?
Just give it a second. He still won’t find the cheese.
He wins.
If you give a mouse a jet pack, he will shatter your research.
Subject #007 lives up to his name, I see.
Let’s switch back to the Roquefort.
Now this is truly a mazing.
This experiment seems cheesy.
We have been encouraging  them to think outside the box.
I told you we shouldn't have shown them Mission Impossible
It seems she is aware of our status change from College to University.
A little gene-splicing – and he's already way ahead of you.
This is definitely an outlier.
Shows initiative. Failed to find the cheese.
I’m going to check “Thinks outside the box” on that one.
We may be witnessing the origin story of the next Marvel comics superhero.
Let’s call that an outlier.
We're going to need a harder maze.
I wondered how the cow jumped over the moon.
He's rejected the cheese, but seems to be eyeing the liquor cabinet.
So that's what happens when you give a mouse an Amazon Prime account!"
They were bred for the space program.
I thought you gave him the jet pack.
Apparently our maze is old school.
Gee whiz - Why didn't we think of that?
Red Bull is now underwriting the study.
They don't learn the maze and they don't want to exercise. These rats are just like my kids with their tech toys.
Don't be offended, but I've always been attracted to black women
I spent a week building this maze.
Well, Tonya, what did we learn?
Don't worry, we can market this to Amazon and make a bundle!
Well, B.F. Skinner is not here, is he?
Meh, not so impressive. The previous specimen had Amazon Fresh deliver it right to him.
Oh it definitely didn't do that for the Muenster...
I told you not to use the NASA mice.
We're gonna need a better maze
This is the mouse we injected with the Chuck Norris strain.
Guess that settles its fight for flight response.
I denied their request for gouda.
This gives new meaning to Rat Pack.
I can’t say whether this experiment was a failure or a success.
Using jet fuel? In this economy?
The pepperjack seems to have the biggest kick.
They're not THAT smart. They still can't figure out the afterburner. Don't look at the ceiling if you have a weak stomach.
OK. Send in a request for a maze lid.
Just wait until he tries to go over water.
Personally, I would have walked.
Should we tell him this won't get him the participation compensation?
Is it just me, or do you get the impression we're underestimating their cognitive skills?
We need to develop a retirement plan.
Shouldn't we be concerned, Henry?"
"No, Janice, he is wearing a helmet.
Well, so much for pavlovian conditioning. I think she made the labyrinth irrelevant.
He asked to see our cross-platform promotion strategy first.
I think we did it, Meghan. We have indisputable evidence. They’ll have to take Trump University serious now!
Of course, he's outgrown his maze; I told you the reward was too generous.
I think we're going to need higher walls.
We really need to stop buying rats from Richard Branson
He's training to be the mascot for the Space Force
First I take your cheese, then I take your research grant!
I hate smart ass mice!
I guess we should make the next maze a little harder.
Evolution just took a flying leap.
They were promised cheese; what did you expect?
I just checked.  There is nothing in the rules agains it.
Don't tell the boss about this. If she finds out how smart this rat is, there go our jobs.
He said with just a little more funding, he can get it out of the prototype stage.
It's not his first rodeo.
That’s one small step for a mouse, one giant leap for mousekind.
It's not the vertical mouse I asked for.
Are they allowed to do that?
He will attempt to cure cancer next.
You wanted the other kind of pack rat?
Our next grant application is to NASA
‘Its only a small step sir’
Yes it is cheating, but look at him fly!
I didn't know that he was one of the three blind ones.
There's our proof.  IQ testing is necessary.  All mice are not created equal.
So that's what he meant by having a 'power lunch'.
Can't we please just give him the cheese?
Now he wants his own Youtube channel
Is that a Tesla logo?
There’s one  way to beat the rat race.
The cheese is to fly for
Same dose as the other rats, except this ones got style.
Did you download the GPS app into the helmet?
We have to stop letting the undergrads design our experiments.
They did demand a double blind study!
Another project funded by the Pentagon?
Now that he easily solved it, he thinks he's the big cheese.
Where’d she get the helmet?
Well I think she’s disqualified.
No! Don’t tell the boss...the little guy has earned it.
He says one more cheese maze and he'll vaporize us.
Do you think we have gone a bit too far with our behavioral testing?
I can't wait to see what happens when we double the dose of this new drug.
What kind of cheese are we using?
I told you using the Gouda would make a difference
I blame the Millennials.
Are you sure you put the L.S.D. in HIS water?
He's certainly got better funding that we do.
Mice these days are so lazy.
Maybe we shouldn't have used the mice from Mensa!
The control group is using hang gliders."
And he's selling our cheese
Do you think he'll like that cheese?
That Pet CBD oil is amazing...
I think we should still count this as failing the maze
I guess we need a code for "jet-packed" now.
Note that when it comes to cheese, Buzz is highly motivated.
Let’s roll him back to triple espressos in the morning.
Did you use the good cheese again?
We need to invent a better maze for this one.
Not to mention we'll need a better trap.
You shouldn't have named him Elon Mousk.
I think he was expecting a mild Brie.
He's part of the control group that includes pepperoni.
Amazing difference using green cheese.
Letting him watch every episode of Pinky and the Brain seems to have paid off
The last one headed straight for the moon. Go figure.
Do you remember when flubber was the state of the art?
Algernon always was an overachiever.
This is always the easy part. He now has 15 seconds complete the raclette stage.
This rodent is pure Evel!
Lining their nests with that Asimov novel is skewing our data
You ever think how, in a way, we're all just working to get that cheddar?
This one is in our 'Not Exposed to Social Media' subgroup.
Sometimes you're the cheese and sometimes you're the rat.
What? You told me to think outside of the box!
Holy shit. Dad is gonna kill us.
Yeah the human race is doomed, but on the plus side his results are off the charts
They’re getting tired of the daily rind.
Let’s put him in a cancer study.
Do you think they will still say the findings aren't generalizable?
I guess there is such a thing as too much funding.
Technology makes this generation so lazy!
That one's Elon Muskrat.
What hath God rat
I raised the dosage of Adderall for this one
I suspect, they were only doing it because it meant so much to us.
I told you we shouldn't let him get deliveries from Amazon.
Want to go back to my place?
Well, sure, if he's going to cheat.
I figured a dose of cocaine that size would have killed him. But instead he became, like, insanely tight.
We exclude the outliers.
Apparently, he was too stupid to figure it out.
My mistake, I thought management said to research autono-MOUSE drones.
He's cheated before.
Still think STEM is right for you?
After his bankruptcies, fraudulent charity,  fraudulent university, and a dozen sexual assault accusations, this looks acceptable.
Interesting.
Our critics are going to have a tough time reproducing the research data on this one.
Let's clone this one.
I think we should just give him our job and call it a day.
Maybe next time you won’t doubt my hypothesis Carolyn.
Despite all his rage, he is still just a rat in a maze."
I told you we should've set some ground rules.
I really hate the scientific method.
Algernon seems to be making great strides!
He's on loan from the jet propulsion lab.
There's always one smart-ass in the cage
Does that mean it's technically a bat?
Any idea how we score this one?
Don’t forget, we’re calculating rat intelligence
with a truncated mean, discarding the high and
low ends. So just ignore this little guy.
Who studies behaviour any more anyway?
Given that she designed and built her own jet pack, her ability to learn and navigate the maze seems like a profound misallocation of resources.
Um, these results are going to be difficult to reproduce.
He’s a transfer from the MIT lab.
I'll bet B.F. Skinner never imagined this.
I guess he was thinking outside the box.
That's one giant leap for Mickey, but sadly, the end of our maze experiments.
Clever yes, but the rat didn't learn the maze.
Let's just count that one as experimental error.
Maybe we underestimated his intelligence.
call the cat in here...
Okay, I guess we’d better make the maze harder.
You mean the drugs were supposed to be for the mice?
From our experiments, we've concluded that jetpacks are an effective way of getting cheese
I told you NOT to use rats from New York City,...the "rat race" takes on a whole new meaning there.
Quite frankly, I don’t know if I’ve ever witnessed a better laid scheme.
Year of the rat? 2020 is year of the gear of the rat.
Kill them all. Destroy your notes. The world must never know.
These NASA Rats cut straight to the cheese.
I feel like one of the Three Blind Mice.
The Helmut was his idea.
Apparently they're smarter than we thought they were.
R&D is doing well I see?
Well, I guess this proves your theory that when we take away their sense of smell the rat can adapt."
What kind of cheese did you put in there?
They go a little crazy for the Boursin
Evolution, time to build a better mouse trap or find a new job.
Greatest leap in mouse tech, and he still just wants the cheese.
There's got to be an easier way to grill cheese.
Smart?  Smart!  He hasn't even patented it yet!
It's only a matter of time before he figures out drone delivery.
Do you think the mouse would mind if I ate the cheese?  I skipped lunch today...
I didn't give it to him. I thought you gave it to him.
Association doesn't mean causation.
I think Karen has spent too much time watching the Jetsons during her breaks
It's the prototype for a micro-delivery service to cat-free households.
Well, looks like our hypothesis about income inequality in this population is confirmed.
This won't cure cancer.
You let him watch Star Wars didn't you?
I'm afraid the experimental design makes no allowance for this level of adaptive  behavior.
Is this that "Rat Pack" people are always talking about?
Tweet the President: Space Corps passed first test.
I blame climate change.
Well, he did after all solve the problem
It’s the complete lack of respect for old school that hurts the most.
That has to be my late husband—his kind of trick for sure.
He’s smart, but a total cheater.
Pretty soon he’s going to want more than cheese.
This may be how the keep getting in.
This must be the one in Mensa.
In 2020, mice did it. In 2016, pigs.
Looks like the treatment worked.
His air-to-fuel mixture is way off. Rookie move!
I thought the Pavlovian Resistance Squad was only a rumor.
It's not cheating; he's just thinking outside the box.
He has the technology, but SHOULD he have the technology.
As you can see , mature male rat #007 draws inspiration from his namesake.
I guess this will be a three blind study.
His sponsor is Elon Musk.
I’ll let you be lead author on the journal paper.
These rats are from the upper east side, let's use brie.
These young mice are in such a hurry these days.
I think subject 5 has outgrown the maze.
The gouda made him gassy so I went with it on this one.
CRISPR may be having unintended consequences...
If we could only get it to not melt the cheese when he lands
This is a blatant disqualification.
I wonder how the monkeys are doing
But, he's from the control group!
He calls himself Elon Mouse.
Stupid mouse.  He's going to burn the cheese with his rocket pack.
We need to let  Amazon know that we have finished testing Ratpack pick up service.
Check out Elon Mousk over here.
Cheating little rat!
Intelligence has become very hard to measure.
See what!?
The Behavioral Research Lab just got awesome!
He locates the cheese in seconds ... he spends most of his time showing off for the female mice in cage 42.
I guess our work is done?
That's the 'Elon Musk-Rat'.
4.92 seconds - I win - take off your shirt.
We might need to rethink our test parameters.
Algernon?
why do we always get the leftovers from NASA?
It says to put a farmers wife at the end of the maze.
Well, that is thinking out of the maze.
Geeez, Marge, I think this one has gone and disqualified himself!
He's clearly in the placebo group because the others built drones.
Should I write this one down as risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior?
Technology is not exactly killing behavioral psychology, but it sure is speeding up getting results.
If he can navigate the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the next experiment, then I’m ready to put him in charge of the lab.
I don't understand these Millennial mice. How is building a jetpack easier than just running the maze?
I just feel like we’re hitting a wall with this study.
PETA insists the corners must be rounded.
Wow, that escalated quickly.
The power of cheese stinking outside the box.
We gotta up our game.
Is this the one that went to MIT?
One small step for mice, one giant leap for moon cheese
The gene-spliced opposable thumb seems to have worked.
I think he has claustrophobia
Well, he did build that better mouse trap last time.
He's going to want a nice Barolo with that.
Well, no more denying; the time has come to upgrade our lab equipment.
Yes, technically, he is cheating, but he did find the cheese in record time.
Definitely not part of the placebo group.
The economics of same day delivery just got a lot better.
We'll need a different intelligence test.
OSHA compliance overseer. He’ll be out of here soon enough.
It appears the rats are gaining on the humans.
I think they're catching on.
I don't like cheese , bitch.
Truly, the cheese has been moved.
I've only seen this behavior in seals before.
Suicidal.  Lactose and gluten intolerant.
Biology 101, question your assumptions.
We should never have implied that the moon is made of cheese.
So the space rats came in with their own equipment?
That rat is off the charts.
Well, he did say he was lactose intolerant.
Did you put smart water in his bottle?
I knew they were up to something when they asked for jet engine fuel.
He's auditioning for the sequel: The Mouse That Soared
Looks like he just joined the Jet Rat Pack
He goes by Elon Mouse.
It’s a Federal government mouse. That explains its cheating.
For energy level, just write “jet fuel”.
We don’t award points for creativity.
We shouldn't have let him see that the cheese is plastic.
Maybe we shouldn't have let them watch that episode of 'How It's Made'.
I’d suspect he’s overthinking this.
Why are you offended, Tina? I'm just trying to explain how a maze works.
Yeah it’s impressive but he’s ignoring the cheese. He’s heading toward the fridge. My lunch is in there, Linda.
The test paradigm didn't cover this.
I told you mouse is better than joystick...
He says Elon Musk had better cheese.
We are all very proud of the creativity young Rodney shows in some of his maze runs; but you must make sure he stays below the walls.
It proves there is hope for advancing Trump’s decision making skills, as long as he likes cheese.
We just don't calculate for rapid technological leaps, do we?
We injected this one with venture capital.
The same mouse that could do this couldn't make its own cheese?
He has an unfair advantage. Should we kick him out?
Now the others are whining they want one just like it.
We should remember never to start the experiment with Elon Mouse.
Seal the lab, now!
M.I.T . Mouse
Well, we didn't control for THIS variable...
This one must be a Muskrat.
You think he's ready for the next rat race?
Well, technically he found it fastest.
This one took the placebo.
| heard once you should dress | for the job you want and not |  the job you have, so...”
Rough day, huh?
Can we go back to building better traps now?
Watching Mandalorian has really affected this one.
If this succeeds it could really kill the maze business!
It's on his bucket list.
I certainly hope it isn't from the control group.
Do you think the report should at least footnote that we reduced the jet thrust?
I thought I warned you about buying rats from 5-star restaurants
He's got a thing for smoked Swiss.
I try to ignore him but he just keeps mocking me.
Where did he find goggles that small?
Who gave him the helmet?
No wonder Mickey didn't want the job!
Well, Bob did say to think outside the box.
Now we know why Swiss cheese has holes
Ok, now that we’ve successfully trained a rat to use a jet pack, tell me again how this will benefit man-kind?
I'm surprised the group with goggles is doing so well!
Say what you will,but he remembered where to find the cheese.
I told you that the independent variable shouldn’t have been Mythbusters
We've lost control of our control group.”
And that's just with half-dose.
where did you say you got him from?
It doesn't change the fact that the scientific method requires a negative hypothesis.
Natural selection?
The interns call him Elon Muskrat.
She won’t even do the maze if it’s Brie.
At the Jet Propulsion Lab they learned about grilled cheese.
I think the brain study team will want to see this.
Hmm, kinda makes me feel dumb.
Subject exhibits remarkable improvement in attitude - not to mention altitude and airspeed.
If you give a mouse ‘an introduction to thermodynamics’
They're learning.
That's 'cause he used to handle deliveries for Amazon.
He tried a zip line.
This adds a third dimension to our study. I’ll fix the spreadsheet.
He's bending the rules. But you have to admit, he's progressing quite rapidly.
They’ve evolved.
As long as this mouse doesn't explode, the Pfizer backpack should be ready for human trials.
Looks like Bob read "Who Moved My Cheese" to the mice again last night.
After a review of your subjects' test scores, we have to let you go. Not a simple maze completed.
It is a new record, but he cheated!
What's the reward now?
I'm not sure genetically enhanced rats was such a great idea!
I knew we shouldn't have played Elton John during the study.
I told you we shouldn’t use NASA’s leftover mice.
Do you think that's cheating?
We are similar species after all, it was just a matter of time.
He’s only hurting himself by cheating..
His other startup bores the holes into the cheese.
The Institutional Review Board has requested more information about our research protocol."
She knows how to get to it.  The problem is she hates limburger.
Do you still think the world will beat a path to our lab now?
At least I am tenured.
I see now why you named him ‘Elon.’
His resume claims he used to deliver packages for Amazon.
It would appear that the key to Evolution is upgrading the cheese.
Aw, too bad. I like it when we stump ‘em.
Onto the human trials...
I think we underestimated the female rats.
RatBond: “The Quantum of Cheddar”,  I’ve written a great script.
We’re going to need a peer review.
This will take the replication crisis to a whole new level.
This one thinks out of the box.
Go get the Parmesan.  Wait, no...the Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Okay, no more French cheeses.
Ok, let's stop here and talk to the dolphins first.
Subject seems to have used other methods of solving the maze..
Quick, get the copyright on "jet-pack-lab-rat"...
Despite our efforts to disrupt it, their jet propulsion program has reached beta testing.
He makes a delicious queso
Trump wants to weaponize Pizza Rat.
At least we now know who has been stealing the lab's rocket fuel.
I don't think we can allow them to play video games anymore
Does he know what comes next?"
He knows where the cheese is.  He just wanted a faster way to get to it.
The results are clear, your intelligence potion does not improve maze performance.
Life, uh, finds a way.
We need to pump the brakes on the Marvel movies.
Did you use gruyere this time?
Dairy intolerant I'm afraid.
At least they get free healthcare out of these trials."
Yeh....show me the cheese!
Now I see why you named him Elon Mouse.
I told you he was an over-a-cheeser.
I think this one wants a scholarship"
We're researchers, not referees - so what if they cheat?
I guess that's one way to get the cheese...
Well this is an unexpected finding
Call Malcom Gladwell.
Okay fine, honey. I’m sorry I said your animal behavior research isn’t rocket science.
It’s progress, but it’s no hoverboard.
Not bad but how fast can he get to the cheese without the jet pack?
We may need to revise the grades beyond pass/fail.
We made no progress on our cancer research but we did build this adorable jet pack
Do you see the glasses too?
Get better cheese – she only took the wine.
She says she’s Mouse;: Minnie Mouse.
Oh great...that's ruined the experiment and now we've learnt nothing.
You see? Circumvention is human nature.
Ok, now let's put the roof on.
It says the maze endowment ran out in 1974.
Have the test subjects demonstrated any additional human-like capacities, such as for vengeance?
Well, if nothing else, we've proven that necessity really is the mother of invention.
What we get for accepting a NASA grant.
This should boost our chances for that Amazon research grant.
Now that's REALLY thinking out of the maze
To the moon, Alice
Enjoy your launch break.
What exactly did you put in the cheese?
Janet, pass me my iPhone. This will go viral.
His great, great grandfather was the pioneer mazer.  Just let him fly, get his cheese, and leave it out of the report.
Not funny, Ralph. Now take off that silly costume.
I think our days here are numbered.
I blame You-Tube
Dr. Bleetstein, this looks to be the sign of an elevated intellect.
I didn't even know they made helmets that small.
I’m thinking Algernon just one-upped Charlie.
This Millennial strain of rat seeks instant gratification.
This one has a "Jetsons" disorder.
So much for training him to run the maze.
Didn't I say there'd be trouble if we let Peabody from Aeronautics recommend interns for us?
Game changer!
What a shame, Rosco failed to run the course. I thought he had promise.
I just asked him if he had any other smart ideas.
Until he sticks that landing, we’ll never know if we succeeded in making him lactose intolerant.
For the love of cheeses!
When you give a mouse a cookie...
This could be a new record.
You can ignore outfliers.
Did you get these mice from NASA?
Maybe we should have set some guidelines?"
American? No thank you!
I'll never accept funding from AARP again,
What did you expect? When you give a mouse venture capital...
He says he ordered the whole charcuterie.
But he still didn’t actually memorize the maze, so he gets an F. That should discourage the others from cheating.
Told you.
Dock 2 points for recklessness and disregarding lab emissions requirements.
I think we’re taking this 3 blind mice thing a little too seriously !
I think it's learned to "think outside the box".
So does this mean we can go home now?
I see he's learned how to think outside the box.
Research shows that making the wall into a maze won't work either.
I can retire now.  They finally solved the maze.
next time we’ll see what the little fucker does when we put his ass in the dishwasher — try to MacGyver your way out of that one you little shit
Better dial back the NZT.
We are testing a prototype for Amazon
Now does he go for the Swiss or salvation?
This is the one they call 'Elon Mouse'
What are we doing wrong? Why can't they invent hoverboards?
That proves his IQ is over 120.  We can't use him in any other experiments.  Put him back in the sewer.
The scary part is his fleas told him how to make it.
But is he really _thinking_ Dana, that's the question
Nothing special, just a fight or flight response.
We increased her research budget this quarter.
She actually came to us from Amazon's lab.
This participant was funded by Elon Musk.
He's from Mouse Team 6?
Think we'll have to penalize him for going off course.
He can launch, but he can't cut the cheese.  Not exactly amazing.
Somehow he moved the cheese. I smell a rat!
The third time’s the cheese.
I think he's the one that was gnawing on the Physics Textbook.
Ras in crise
You should never have named him Geronimo.
You agreed to not give him an HOV lane
So far he's the only one who thought outside the box!
I told you not to name him MacGyver.
I have no answer for this.
Too bad he's lactose intolerant.
This beats carrying a slice of pizza down subway stairs.
He’s part of the test group that watched Iron Man.
Well, we are studying evolution, after all.
Don't be too impressed. It's no flying car.
The brain serum seems to work better since we added cheese to the equation.
Sharon and I broke up. I told her I needed some space.
The rat did really think outside the box
Rat pack" has a certain swing to it
He transferred from the aerospace program.
We didn't anticipate he'd invent the Rat Jet Pack
That's cheating - don't record it.
Darn it, | forgot the flag.
I told him that this could be the game changer. Do you agre?
Don't you think it would be better to start them at the OTHER end?
Perhaps we should inform HR that Dimitrov and Natasha may have been telling the truth about the missing jet fuel.
It’s unbelievable! I can’t believe he didn’t cite your 2016 paper on rocket propulsion.
He always insists on doing cardio first.
Well, we did hear he wants to transfer to the NASA testing lab.
If we could only figure out how he got the funding
I didn't realize what an incentive 20 year old cheddar would be.
But then, it’s failing to complete the maze.
I told you this would make him an asshole. It always does.
He’s been binge watching James Bond movies in his off hours.
He’s thinking out of the box!
Thinking outside of the box, I'd say
He keeps cheating!
He seems to be headed for the door.
He's one of the ones we got  from NASA...
I'm not sure how to grade this
This VR Set can not fool me enough!
Should we tell the pigeons?
Looks like we are finally able to prove that the cheese stands alone!
Yes, I'm sure you build great walls, but I just don't see how that will solve the problem...
Why didn’t we think of that?
Maybe some crackers?
These mice were smart to start with, but now it looks like they've gotten into technology.
He's sponsored by Elon Musk.
As impressive as that is, it kind of defeats the purpose.  Don't you think?"
‘We call this experiment A Few Good Mice and Men.”
I think it might be time to update our design.
He said he needed to have "the big picture".
I still think this round of tests on the effects of  GMO cheese are  not 100% conclusive.
Whatever happened to our luddite rats?
I think Mr. Bezos will like these results.
Marry me, and take me away from this rat race.
No, still no signs of flight shame.
Have we tried cheddar yet?
If our research  is correct, it clearly shows Swiss cheese is brain food.
I told you to order the new mice from the Genetic Testing Lab, not the Jet Propulsion Lab.
You know, we got rid of natural selection a while back.
In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have lined the cage with an Elon Musk essay.
We got fooled again...
There's nothing to explain once we label it as experimental error.
He thinks he's here to be a contestant on "The Amazing Race".
Give him an A++ for effort.
I think the jet pack is almost ready for Shark Tank!
At least it's not using a drone.
Did you grab one of the gene-editted ones?
Martha, does my coat make me look frumpy?
Generation Y, they were born with technology in their hands.
And we've been spending all of time 
trying to build a better mousetrap.
This one is from the Upper East Side.
Maybe we should go back to the Gen-X rats. These millennials don't like to follow the rules.
'He sure has trained us."
There’s nothing on the checklist for creative technology
I agree he cheated but I am clueless about how to log this into our research results.  Wait ... it's like HE is testing US!
Fascinating.  I did not see that coming.
We're going to need a lot more cheese!
I guess it is Limburger."
Actually he knows how to solve the maze.   The jump pack is just to make the fondue.
He insists on diet and exercise.
So that's what happened to the missing drone kit!
Let's stop borrowing the engineering' department's rats.
Wait, it the goal to get the cheese or to get out of the maze?
How do we measure his intelligence if he's going to cheat.
Well he left the cheese. Who wants a sandwich?
Better send this one back to NASA.
I was going to name him Elon Mouse-k, but it felt too on the nose.
And believe it or not, he's fueling it with cheese.
Well this is going to skew the data. Let's put a roof on the maze and start again.
Hmm...Not smart enough for the maze, but this they can do.
We will throw this outlier data out.
We may want to rethink those genetic modifications....
Now we know how that equipment account got drained so quickly.
He' never tried this hard. I think he knows he's going to the medical study lab next week.
Going down.
The corporate Rats seem to love Elon's new equipment.
Naming him Elon Mousk was a mistake.
I guess naming him Orville was a good call
Well, he did have to learn to use the jet-pack first.
Hey, the test rats deliver the package 90.6% of the time...except when it’s cheese!
Impressive. The assembly instructions are in pagalog.
Hire the handicapped they said
I told you not to put them next to the jetpacks.
Does it illustrate a natural tendency towards creative problem solving or is it our artisanal cheese choice is too motivational?
So, I guess we can leave early for lunch today?
Yes, STEM really does work.
Doc, if i could suggest adding a roof to the design next time?
Clearly, this is not her first rodeo.
Look's like your dosage made him too smart for his own gouda.
Darn Millenials.
I guess this is the opposite of building a better mousetrap?
We have to stop getting our mice from DARPA.
He's definitely the brightest one in his cohort.
I left for five minutes, came back and this one was hovering over the cheese!
Maybe we shouldn't have used your weed-infused cheese?
Jokes on him.  We didn't use real cheese"
Everything evolves.
On the plus side, it looks like your intelligence enhancing cheese is a success!
He ordered it right after we took away his drone.
You said you had blocked their access to Amazon.
This proves my theory that rats aren't afraid of heights.
That's so Gen Z, am I right?
I don't know if this is what he meant when he said, "double blind".
Instead of aimless maze-running, he now uses a rocket suit and bills himself as Iron Mouse.
Yes, but where did he fuel up?
I think he's hovering near a solution.
Elon is thinking outside the maze again.
This mouse was donated by that actress in the college admissions scandal
Perhaps it was emboldened by the Chinese Lunar Year of The Rat calendar on the wall.
The rats from Google Labs are  game changers.
Well Linda, you said make the maze easier...
Well, we could just fudge the data and say he built it himself.
Perhaps we shouldn’t have named him’Elon’.
How do I score THIS!?
This one’s going above and beyond.
Evolution. I guess...
I think you’ve come up with the right blend of ginkgo biloba to espresso.
He actually already had a patent pending for the Rat Pack when I got here.
We really should have thought out giving them access to Amazon Prime.
Is this all you got done?
Thirty years with JPL, and it has come to this.
Sir, I think you may have  misunderstood our courtesy shuttle system...
Must have escaped from a different lab, don't you think?
"The smart ones focus on the journey not the designation."
This isn't publishable,is it?
I'm sure it's just a phase.
Just think if our Elon applied himself to something constructive.
Yes, of course it skews the results.
I think we have to accept that we've been outsmarted by a mouse.
He just hovers over it, his Carbon Footprint is high but is cholesterol is low.
It’s amazing what they can do with a water bottle, wheel, and cedar chips.
But can it handle China's new surface-to-air mousetraps?
He’s Bonding.
And that’s when I told  my wife. Honey, I need some space
Walking in the club like excuse me sir
All the best for the SpaceX demo Mr.Musk!
I am not sure if this is enough but this is the highest we can  go, sir
Whoa! What the hell? That's not Gouda!
Great.  Now they'll ALL want one.
Relax...We  are going to win the anti-Nobel for most useless invention !
Can we both agree to never mention this to the IRB?
Jesus Christ that's Jason Bourne.
Yea, but how does this improve his cognitive skills?
This is the one we fed in cannabis
The force is strong with this one but he's really going to skew our results.
In his defense, Burns said often, not always.
Time to harvest that sweet, sweet adrenochrome.
He can fly now, that's why we keep the door closed.
These millennnial mice are a pain in the ass.
Andy Kaufman could have a field day with this.
Another drone user test complete!
I didn't expect this, Skinner. It's thinking outside the box.
What are we smoking?
What's the second-place prize?
That's not the half of it. It runs off droppings!
I'm not surprised.  We had him pegged as a high flier early on.
No more mice from Elon Musk, okay?
Swiss...why is it always Swiss?
Which supplement did he get?"
This will make Adderall worthless.
We’re going to need a bigger maze budget.
Let’s not give that lab rat so much time in the lab.
He seems to like the virtual reality version better.
Should we accept that the end justifies the means?
It wasn't supposed to be smart
I'm a cheese-lover but his enthusiasm is over the top.
I don't know. He seemed fine, then he just said "Fuck it" and walked out of the maze.
Is that the overachiever?
It’s confirmed—he’s a pack rat.
I knew is would happen...we need a 3D maze
He’s been watching The Big Bang Theory.
I am surmising our experiment has been contaminated with the LSD trials.
You say this one was sent over from NASA?
Well he’ll never have to worry about going hungry.
...And he only spent a day with Elon Musk.
I TOLD you the virtual reality glasses were a bad idea!
Don't worry, rats are notoriously bad at aerodynamics.
I hate when he pulls this James Bond stuff.
In this test, we’re dealing with it’s aversion to melted cheese.
Time to re-evaluate our hypothesis.
As irresistibly charming as these clipboards are, next time we video-tape.
Now THAT'S thinking outside the box!
Once again, Rocket Mouse seems to have the edge over the other subjects.
We’ll, there’s nothing in the rule book that forbids it’s use.
We will need to observe social visits from friends and family members more closely.
He said that he wanted to think outside the box!
It appears the mouse has elevated his game.
All our hard work is taking off.
You said "Let's try the drones."  Now look what's happened!
You shouldn't have asked for same-day delivery.
We also need to build a better mousetrap.
We should probably dial back the Red Bull dosage.
They're evolving.
Rat with a jet pack is already trending...
We need to find another source for animals other than NASA.
I'm hungry.
He bought it on Amazon
He said it was a Christmas present
How come they got the jetpacks in 2020?
We told it the moon was made of cheese.
The white one is demanding his GPS.
He is officially joining the new rat race.
Rat #007?
Do they get extra points for thinking out of the box?
Weird. That subject is from the control group.
I'm titling my journal article, "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH: The Next Generation."
Under "Male / Female" it says "All Male"
We didn't control for that
There are holes in your experiment.
Did you leave the Amazon app open on your phone?
Sorry but I think it's too late to try to copyright "The Rat Pack".
That's amazing!I didn't know that they made jetpacks that small.
I take it Agent 006 1/2's training is progressing on schedule, Q?
need some space!
Yes sir, ll check to see if the dry cleaners can have your space suit back by Monday.
Ground floor to Major Tom?
This iSait4 he
Makes you wonder if the results are skewed.
We're going to need more cheese.
Is there a ‘superior innovational abilities’ column on your clipboard?
He's beating us at our own game.
You were the one that told him he could have the cheese 'when guinea pigs fly'...
I named him Musk Mouse.
All I did was make him watch Thunderball.
We said he was into rejection but he didn’t hear the “r”
What a shame. Poor little guy doesn't realize it's processed American cheese.
We've been able to make great progress with the rats, but I think humans have become too easily distracted to safely operate it.
Well, that's new!
It clearly shows remarkable intelligence, but is it commercially feasible?
I don't have one of those.
Did you say that was jarlsberg?
I think a mouse knows to turn the corners.
Anything for the cheeeeeese.....
Turns out he's lactose intolerant.
He's hovering over the ultimate choice: 'grill or don't grill?'
You know right away which ones have the Rat Stuff.
That one says he's lactose intolerant...
I guess they are learning...
Elon Musk will be pleased.
To me, the biggest proof of intelligence improvement is the helmet.
Since the lower species still believe in science this was inevitable.
Are the windows closed? The last time he took off down Broadway.
Is this what they mean by a rat race?
What do you mean you've lost count?
Next time, don't name your lab rat "Tony Stark."
When I got into this line of work I knew there would be days like this
Tom and Jerry are working on a helicopter, Mickey used a Segway. It’s a much better cheese than they’re used to.
How the Mighty Mouse has fallen.
It's powered entirely by a smugness found deep in the Silicon Valley.
Is this the new protocol for the nominee selection process?
James Bond” decided he wouldn’t crawl through the maze like the others.  Had to rise above the rest of them.
The negotiations got out of hand when they went on strike. Also they said they want pepper jack now.
I want a divorce.
We forgot to factor in lactose intolerance.
He refused to even make the effort until we put out the Emmentaler.
You just had to name him Elon.
That piece of cheese has not moved in over an hour.
PAY UP!... The rat wins again...
Modern problems require modern solutions.
Yeah, it's a breakthrough - but it's still cheating.
The cheese exhibits no reaction whatever, doctor.
Gracy, it isn't too late to stop this madness...
Is that allowed?
We have to stop watching DYI...
Ok. We need a roof.
Another vegan.
Gee, I'm hungry ...
He technically  failed the test, but I would say the experiment was an astounding success!
They observed the changes the unearned advantage had caused the rat. Left  better situated than 99% of his kind, he chose a tasty treat over emptying the cages.
No surprise there, that's mouse 007.
It didn't work.
With Disney+, now everyone's looking for the next Marvel spin-off
He’s cheating...
It doesn't matter where we put the cheese or how we change the maze, he's always the fastest finisher.
He used to work at a NASA facility.
Did you remember to attach his parachute?
We've been underestimating them for years.
Did you notify the FAA about this flight?
And yet he didn't even finish the maze.
All that for a cracker?
He's really flying through this one
Well, looks like the space program has been cut again.
Maybe we should stick with cheese and lose the Red bull.
Has the intern been in here again?
We should have thought of that.
Now that’s a rat pack...

well, it is good cheese.
This one learned to think outside the box.
It looks impressive but he took 100 times longer than average to find the cheese. Progress?
Looks like Jerry is avoiding his problems again
He CLAIMS he’s lactose intolerant.
I have no idea who sent it. All the package said was:


To: Maze Lab 

From: Gene Modification 

Contents: One rat and control unit.
Fuck. He found the cheese.
I'm thinking it's going to invalidate the results of the study...
She's always been our top lab animal.
Talk about taking the initiative.
Maybe Space Force could use mice, not men.
Now we need a 3-D maze!
We need to stop using rats from the early acceptance program.
We'll have delivering cheese in a week.
The scariest thing is that I think he also know who moved his cheese.
I think he's been gunning for my job...
Well he didn't have breakfast...
As long as he doesn't start vaping, I'll allow it.

I'm afraid he's beaten us.
She broke through the glass ceiling.
are you sure it was ONLY vegemite?
cognition increased but do we consider using his mate for rocket fuel a side affect?
You're missing the point. The object isn't to see how fast the mouse can get the cheese, but how much cheese we can get out of the government.
I understand we gave him the jetpack gene, but where'd he find the fuel?
That's one from the free range batch.
According to the lab dogs, training is complete when they follow me around with the little plastic bags instead of a clip board

This mouse was exposed to reruns of  "MacGyver".
They're getting too intelligent...
Phase one, done. Now that he's airborne, we need to get him a theme song. And maybe a new hat.
I think it was a touch of vertigo.
Now that's what I call "Thinking out of the box!"

We should have suspected something when none of the traps worked
It's an Elon Musk Rat.
I think we're going to need more cheese.
So...Ira...where's the box for "variables shmariables?"

Either way, I'm not so sure it's ready for human testing.
Just give him the cheese. This maze is for blind mini mice.
He's also enrolled in the PhD program.
Perhaps this mouse supplier thought we were a SpaceX lab.
Well, this isn't working out any better than the bats.
It might be better if we pick the equipment.
Yes, impressive but that's a placebo mouse, so disregard it.
I need to check the protocol. I think the electric models are permitted.
He's passed every test we've thrown at him
We provided this one with access to Amazon.

Well.. I wouldn't call it a side effect
It was just a question of time, Marge. That’s what evolution is all about.
I don't care how advanced his discovery is, I still think it's cheating.

He said he's preparing for the rat race.
And this one got the placebo.
He learned the maze last week.  Now, we’re testing for speed.
Please tell me you didn't use the Stilton.
Well, if that doesn't prove that necessity is the Mother of invention, nothing will
I think we have the winner of this rat race.

We should switch to low fat cheese.
We should have just given him up for adoption like I told you. This is on you
Big improvement, operating in the third dimension.
See? The mice we get from private labs really are smarter than the ones we get from public labs.

He arrived at my house for dinner last week.
I think it’s all those Utube videos they’ve been watching in the lab

He told me he was getting tired and couldn't walk any further.
I think for the first time ever we'll be able to proudly say that this drug was tested on animals. He's a genius.
The pay-to-win option may be skewing our results.
Isn't evolution amazing?
Tell me, how does our study protocol account for outright cheating?
Forget the maze, when did you teach him to steal the prototype from next door?
Now he says he's sick of the ratrace and on strike".
But we're not testing them for memory. We're testing them for ingenuity.
This changes everything.

If you had read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," as I told you to, you'd understand
I'd better go close the window.
He forgot his clipboard again.  We told him what would happen.
I'm postulating that the energy used equals the mouse's mass times the smell of the cheese squared."

Must be a kangaroo rat.
He learned that from you, Derek.
Ellon Mousek

He's overachieving.
We can use the grant on something else if we ditch this ridiculous maze
We increased the size of the cheese to stimulate his inventiveness.
Didn't anyone read him the rules?
And thus began the mouse take-over.
Do you want to write that UP?
Just so you know, all of the jumping was purely for educational purposes.
Sorry, we dont go that far up.
Laundry day?’
There was no prep for this small talk thing.
Power dressing for millenials
In 3...2...1...
Where is my Tesla dude?
Can you count down this time?

An Elon Musk-rat.
I'm outta here!
Let me guess: he's the one from Mexico?

Let's get a baseline on us first. I love swiss cheese.
Are you sure this is going to work, Ratatouille?
We need a 3D maze.
I glued the cheese.
This one is knows how to think outside the box

Belichick taught him that one.
Well, I guess Algernon's been watching James Bond..."
I think we need to cut back a bit on the diet pills.
Man, I didn't know mice could evolve into Millennials!
Should we phone Elon Musk?
Nope, I don't think this one will find the cheese either - his GPS is programmed to "the hell out of here."
How much will it cost to put a ceiling on it?
We shouldn't have shown them the Wheel
Look at the maze we live in.  Maybe we should joint it.
Another escapee from the Silcon Valley lab.
Is this the one with the modified JTPCK gene?
A jet pack for the rat pack
Well that's going to screw up the Bell Curve!

Is he deserting a sinking laboratory?
I am pretty sure we can reproduce these results as long as we use the same subjects.
Obviously cat drones are next.
He's come a long way from churning cream into butter, hasn't he?
I told you bringing in the California rats would change everything.
Is that covered under the budget?
Sorry, no mechanically enhanced athletes allowed.
This is implausible but, like, not as implausible as Emperor Palpatine having kids.
I think they forgot to make the glass ceiling.
Is it just a coincidence that we named this one Elon?
He tired of the Tesla faster than we anticipated
Did we just invent airborne rabies?
We can still publish something from this
Shall we get him to grill us a piece?
Whoa! I didn't see that move at all.
I guess we know what happened to the Zippo you thought was lost....
I wonder where he got the fuel.
He wasn’t kidding when he said he was going to the “jet propulsion lab”....
I let him watch the Jetsons on TV at night
Let's stop lining their cages with Sharper Image.
We should really stop buying rats from MIT.
We call hm Elan Muskrat.
Where did that rat get a mini-jet pack?
Did the order say research mice or researcher mice?
The term Mouseketeer is taken.
What did you expect me to do in 2020??
He's not exactly Mighty Mouse, but...
He’s a secret agent of disease
And that's why I said don't use a Musk rat
The power of privilege
There seems to be an issue with the maze.
We shouldn’t have used Jetson for this.
MacGuyver the Mouse” lives up to his name
We may have SERIOUSLY underestimated its resourcefulness, or, it could just be a fluke.
Last time we'll order from the MIT Specimen Nursery, regardless of the 'special pricing' offer.
He was chosen to be the first mouse on Mars. We always make sure he gets the cheese.
This is what happens when Elon Musk gets involved.
It's looks like the slice of cheese helped this time!
Make a note to cut down on his Red Bull.
I have a theory on where he gets the fuel pellets for the solid rocket boosters.
If pack rats are a thing, then jet-pack rats must be, too.
Well this makes all the current mousetraps obsolete.
He's leaving, he's lactose intolerant.
So this is what Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack was up to
I think it evolved above the parameters of our experiment.
He thinks he's James Bond.
When I hear Crisper, I think of a salad.
-These millennial mice are killing the maze test.
This rodent qualifies for space force lab rat...
Give new meaning to “Who moved my cheese...”
I put it down to that vodka martini I spilled here the other day.
That rat studied his options.
If that one is from the control group
Is it possible that this subject came from the cognitive enhancement study down the hall?
He says he learnt this trick in a James Bond movie.
I knew we shouldn't let them watch that Buzz Lightyear movie.
It is essential that you notice the arch on your left.
So I’m willing to document that as a new reward finding record.
We have greatly underestimated their intelligence.
She was raised by ravens.
We should probably go see what the crows are building.
We’ll call it The Musdalorian!
Now that’s a LAByrinthal specimen if I’ve ever seen one
The marketing team for Kraft cheese is going to have a field day with this.
Where the heck did he get the helmet and goggles from?
Even Skinner would say that’s a B.F.D.
I'm just not sure why you bothered making him a helmet when we're just going to slice open his brain after this anyway."
damn. this mouse done copped a tiny jet pack. we didn’t even give him that, no cap!! go off, king. get dat cheese forreal. always on that grind! one hundred emoji devil emoji
Quick--cancel their funding while we’re smarter.
DO WE REALLY NEED AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE?
First, a hot air balloon. Now this.
I think he’s ready to free solo.
Let's ponder implications back in our cubicle.
This test says they are lactose intolerant ".
He's great with mazes, but you don't wanna watch him copulate.
Another Red Bull test subject?
He said, "Swiss?  Again?  Why is it always Swiss?"
The smart drugs work better than expected.
Remember, his generation never watched Mighty Mouse.
I'm going vegan.
Okay, I grant you he's clever.  But the rules, he doesn't follow the rules!
Is the cheese that good?
We didn’t make the rocket pack.
I'm gonna nail this. For me, my buddies, and... cheese
Is that the one that’s always doing the Orson Welles impression?
MR ARMSTRONG, THE STAGE IS SET IN HALL NUMBER 8°
So what if his first maze was not until age 37.
Exhibiting signs of twenty-twenty vision
'He wants to know how we're getting on with the Air to Cat Missiles'.
You've been dating that engineer again, haven't you?
Yes,of course, as you wish: ten, nine, eight, seven...™
Uh Houston, we’ve got a problem
the indoor pool, Sir
which floor? the infinity and beyond please
iGRUSS GOTT"  4
Don’t stop until we lose gravity.
He's hoping for a cheesy landing.
I must say: “ as a researcher, this is an uplifting moment.”
We're gonna need bigger walls.
I guess he isn't happy with his cut of the cheese.
Did you leave the TV on Lynda? Again?
Ok, time to start injecting the mice."
Do you think that we jinxed it by naming him Remy?
Always best to ask a consultant that is personally
 involved in the newest technology.
Those cheeseheads never play by the rules.
C'mon Ron, I told you not to cheat.
He's filing for disability"
Maybe he's lactose intolerant.
Our planet is so doomed! Rats are getting super creative in escaping this sinking ship!
Keep in mind that's just one sample.
he must have watched the james bond movie last night
So.....can I eat that cheese now?
Think he found the maze is kinda unneeded,,cheesy? I guess
He just flew in the open window!
Death is not the end.
He doesn’t like his study arm assignment!
Clearly he thought out of the box. I mean the maze,
Maybe we should try the Camembert
You didn't use my cave-aged Emmenthaler?
He must be a Republican. He’s got no common sense
Unfortunately Miss Buckner, technology has caught up with our research grant..
He could have just used a drone.
This one’s been on a vegan diet for the past month.
Honey badger doesn't care.
Face it -- we're playing crackers and he's playing 3D cheese.”
technology is changing, the rat race it changing, what are we going to do Henry?
I still think the smoked gouda with truffles is a much nicer reward than Swiss.
On the other hand, we're going to need a boatload of cheese.
I blame social media.
To make the experiment really fair we need  comparison results from a two-legged specimen.
Defense spending has really changed the game.
It's a request for limburger
He's smarter than your'e dumbass.
That must be some great cheese.
He feels the need... the need for cheese.
Rat. James Rat.
It’s simply a rat race in there!
Not the Sinatra, he'd have to be the Humphrey Bogart of  the Jet Rat Pack
Professor, can't you see? They're evolving before our very eyes--just like Darwin predicted.
It's a prototype - ratent pending.
Wrong floor. This is not the Mars landing studio.’
You know... you might find the presence of gravity here quite useful.
And your wife, Mr  Johnson? Did you leave her on the moon?
How far do you go up?
Waaay behind in laundry”
you know, there’s a shuttle.
its the 10th floor already and i'm starting to belive they made these 10 stars up
Let me guess, going up?
Next stop Mars.
narf!
Where we did get a rat-sized jetpack?
You're supposed to walk, not fly
We should never have put him on that engineering course
Did it just break the glass ceiling or did we forget to put it on again?
So that's what happened to my mini jetpack.
I think the lactose intolerance drug needs a bit more work, Gayle.
Why yes, out of the box thinking should be noted on the research report. It's standard procedure after all.
So, what’s new?
An acute discovery in gene editing indeed Maria, however one ponders why the subject chose to remain lactose intolerant. Should we contact maintenance or marketing?
Hey Linda, make sure you add this to the fine print.
We've moved the cheese once too often."
i think i know what happened to your research
Ok that's a cool mouse!!!
Looks like he MacGyvered the mousetrap.
That's the one with the Elon Musk gene implant.
Some rat squealed.
What if he doesn't like Limburger?
We have implanted a new gene that makes the mouse eat the cheese and then cut the cheese.
'' Didn't I  tell you what would happen if you switched to peanut butter.''
This is the result of crossbreeding mice with bats.
Are you sure this will help us understand the Senate?
Now he's demanding Gorgonzola Dolce.
I suggest we document his pitch, yaw and roll.
I think he may have gotten into the Gama irradiated cheese."
Lois, can you get the lid please?
It would appear that Mr. Go Go Gadget Ratigan has managed to solve the mystery of the maze.
We need to up our game on the maze for these mice coming over from the Tesla lab.
OK, this is the last time we’re running tests on the Elon Muskrat.
Let R&D know we need to up the better mousetrap budget.
...was this the one who drank his own piss?"
uh... where did he get that?
Waow! ain’t sure we may homologate this one!
I have a few questions about our hypothesis.
Well, they have certainly upped their reconnaissance skills.
knlfg
The results are so unusual,doctor. Every 5 seconds the mouse stops and seems to be reaching for his pocket and looking for his smart phone. How did he learn that? 

AV, Orlando, FL
So he moves on to round three.
Raclette?
Do you ever get tired of the rat race?
- So how much have I missed? - Uhmm flat-earthers are a thing again! - Uh!!!
Renegade from aeronautical rat lab upstairs.
He says the rent is too high.
I don't know whether to ding him on his inability to see the cheese right in front of him or call him genius for making that tiny jet-pack.
How do we score jet pack innovation?
Hi -ho- the-Der-io
The cheese remains alone
Welcome to 2020
Who’ll handle play by play?
Speedy Gonzales, version 3.1
Just looking for my cheese.
One small step for woman, one giant leap for humanity.
——————————————— Before you ask- no, I’m not going up.
You just have  to push the right button and you go up.
Elevators terrify me. | usually take the stairs.’
Wife thinks I have acrophobia.
Great it works,but now we have to make one in human size.
They're a lot smarter than we thought.
And this is Annie. She was donated to our program from Exeter.
Some mice have all the luck."
What should I put down for results? Inconclusive or totally gnarly?
It all started when I was on that Elton John kick last month.
This doesn't bode well for the mice's liberal arts funding.
Came back with that after one of his escapades
Mmm... Just curious? Which box did you tick for this one?
Thank heavens our Defense Department research contract was approved.
Do you think she'd let me have a go?
Remember when I promised not to get anymore lab rats from MIT?
What did you think would happen?
Ah done tole ya and tole ya, DON'T FEED THEM WHEATIES!
I should not have let that IT guy into our lab!
Maybe they're smarter than we thought.
Good thing we didn't pre-register the results.
Now that’s some Gouda cheese!
He is vegan. We need to replace that cheese to have a cruelty-free experiment.
He's learning quickly now that we have turned off his Google maps.
I'mma jet
They fly now?
He used to be a part of the rat race, until he made his money in tech.
It's only in the song that the cheese stands alone.
Is he from the group that watched the Mandalorian?
I think we bred from too much intelligence.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Trump?
Your friends already told us about the jet pack, Mitch.
How ‘bout fondue tonight
If you give a mouse an adderall.
Name is Mousk, Elon Mousk.
So they moved my cheese.
That explains Elon Mouse's crowd funding campaign.
You used an Elon Muskrat, didn't you?
The cheese ate the mouse, 
The cheese ate the mouse, 
Heigh ho, the derry-o, 
The cheese ate the mouse!
He's really up for this test.
This is the last time we use imported cheese on our trials
Call JPL: I think we've found one of their escaped rats.
Must be a Jet Propulsion Lab rat.
Elon is a bit of a show off.
Yes, Doctor.  In time the cheese will mold and the mouse will suffer an anxious state of sexual repression caused by bondage and hunger.
So the efficacy of the IQ booster juice is a check.
Does he know he's been drafted to Iraq?
...well maybe it’ll make more sense when we roll it out.
The idea came to me while listening to some Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr
Oops. Forgot my wallet.
High flyers lounge, sir?
Stratosphere, please
It’s just not the same.
Well, I’m afraid we can only go to the 12th floor of this building.
Rooftop please, they are waiting for me...I lost track of time
Good Evening, Commander. Nice night for a walk.
My wife has just left me because I said I needed  space.
Have a good monday sir
I knew s/he could do it...
Looks like someone's been watching the new season of Lost in Space.
Look fellas, it was either build this jet pack or you would have me jumping through hoops to get the cheese.
Well, he’s a rule breaker. That’s obvious!
There goes the grant funding.
We are up against something new?
Well, he is one of our more gifted rats
Apparently he requested Gruyère.
I don’t think that’s what they meant by “an amazing technology.”
Can this be relevant with a domestic cheese?
That's Elon Muskrat
He really loves his cheese toasted...
Turns out, what we thought were rules, were just precedents.
I told you Elon mouse was going to create emissions pointlessly.
There is no Waze this mouse if going to find it’s way.
Say what you will, but I think the Adderall test results are still conclusive.
Dr. Dreyfus And his steroided mouse won’t like this!
I think we need a bigger Maze
I think this one is supposed to be in the virtual reality experiment.
Happy Anniversary, baby.
Did you bring the fondue skewers?
Stuart got very frustrated after losing his car; now he's all about flying
I say we just get a different rat.
Yes, it is creepy, but I think that he was very clever taking advantage of the drone lab next door
He has a flying car, too.
Its just a timed air-inches test.
Mickey heard some bees are drones, so not to be outdone. . .
OK, he’s playing three-dimensional cheese.
Cat got your tongue?
I guess they weren't hungry before they left.
The pigeons are going to be pissed.
Now you've done it. The FDA will have a meltdown.
Cheesus christ...
I didn't believe him when he said, "Cheese?! I'll develop hoverboard technology before you."
I see the cheese;where is the mouse?
It just got too easy for him.
I just can't get her to quit!
He doesn't care much for Swiss, apparently.
Rebecca Hawkins
Um, does your chart have anything related to mouse flight?
Cause he fails on my chart, related to, you know, cheese acquisition.
If I can't find the cheese, how do you expect Mickey to?
Something' is not right here!
His last job was in the epidemiology lab.
It could just be placebo.
Call Antitrust.
That's not the definition of a 'rat pack'
He can still smell the cheese?
Last week she used it to get into the Viagra experiment.
Sometimes they crack under pressure.
This one is too anal.
I think it's safe to say Aeronautics just had their budget slashed considerably.
Hardly seems worth it for a lousy wedge of cheese.
We could praise this mouse for making a jet pack but I think the real takeaway is that this dumbass can’t run a simple maze. Like “Oh, I have to walk across the street, better build a car!” That’s this stupid fucking mouse talking. Total moron mouse.
He's one of our lunar trainees.
So why did he insist on being restrained?
He must be apart of the ‘out of control group’.
He refuses to go in unless we use  aged cheddar cheese.
The crisper modifications have had an effect!  Unfortunately, a small piece of cheese is no longer his prime motivator!
He is not staying within the lines, but moves effortlessly.
Travel pillows are on the third floor.
Happy Halloween Mr Armstrong
You don’t need to hold the door. Buzz and Neil will be at least two more hours.
Floor 1,326,785 please
Cheater.
I guess that our mister “Rocket Mouse” didn’t like our cheese selection today.
I believe my resume indicated a preference for Epoisses, Janet.
What should I say? He keeps asking if the moon is really made of cheese.
Next, he'll need health care benefits.
These Elon Muskrats really are a breed of their own.
...and we lost funding.
Technology is our enemy
Just like the human test subjects, every time they choose cheese over escape.
Maybe we shouldn’t have named him Icarus, Doctor.
Perhaps you shouldn't have told him you were a farmer's wife ...
I realize now you see the resemblance but don’t take it out on the mice.
He told me it was the year of the rat,but I didn't believe it.
Cheezus, this one's bright.
Getting back from the holiday break has been difficult for them.
The lab techs call him 'Elon Mouske.'
Looks like someone’s been reading those updated Beverly Cleary books again...
Quite clever, this Mighty-Mouse wannabe; wouldn't you say?
I would call the latest drug results as positive."
"I wonder if he can teach us to do that too?
I think you folks are the ones with behavioral issues. Like why do you keep blind-folding us? [And like, I can still smell the cheese...]
Well, this rat has obviously failed the maze experiment.
A new frontier of the common Pack rat, I'll give him that much.
Is this really the best way to understand  the behavior of Trump supporters?
Those must have been Sikorsky’s brain cells we transplanted.
Hand me a letter opener
You can always jetpack up to appreciate the layout of the maze.
I'd say he's ready for the quad-copter.
Incredible! It made it 75% through the maze."
A-maze-ing. Now he’s just showing off. Wouldn’t you agree Bob?
His great-grand-sire was Mighty but the inbreeding didn't take.
I told you it was starting to show withdrawal symptoms.
I really think our maze-escape research has gone too far.
Mouse from test group shows evidence of stunting.
I knew we should have built a taller maze!
He would have been far less motivated by vegan cheese.
Blame it on A.I.
I told you this mouse is ready to fly over the English Channel.
That cheese is so rancid even he can't stand it.
Let’s try the zebra stripe next, Mr. Weinstein.
Release the Minotaur.
Now what do we do? The mice are giving up dairy...
I think all this new safety equipment is making it hard for him to get through the narrow doorways.
If only pizza could help advance us like it did him...
Should we warn the Green Bay Packers?
Clearly the evolution of the Jet-packrat.
It's Mr. Stark's response to Mighty Mouse.
Republican Party Leadership Litmus Test
It's a double-blind study.
This is ridiculous. Just at give him the cheese, you sadist.
Calm down, I'm just leaving.
They weren’t kidding about that penthouse in the sky

High society lounge space?
I didnt receive training for this kind of trip.
Here we are, sir, Mars... or floor 7
Better cut back on their multivitamins.
How can I expect the rats to figure it out if I can
...all we needed was fresher cheese?
Now he wants to be called Mighty Mouse
‘He’s the first cadet for the President’s Space Force.’
On the bright side,we have found our Mighty Mouse.
These pretzels... Are making me thirsty!
Did you cut the cheese?
From now on, I think that all mice should be strictly banned from visiting the 'smartest birds' aviary.
Let's hide somewhere and see if he cheats.
He's food motivated.
It's bad enough he's not food motivated. He also seems to have no fear.
I might have snuck him a Red Bull.
If it wanted the cheese so bad, why didn't it just ask?
He contracted with the scientist aardvarks to build that. But,oy! The cost overruns. Burp! I don't really work here!
Another dumb mouse who can’t  follow the rules.
Was it the cheese or the propulsion?
And he doesn’t even LIKE cheese!
He believes the moon is made of cheese and that this is a training simulation.
I really think using practical effects for this new Stuart Little movie was a great choice
See, I told you not to watch Apollo 13 in front of the test subjects.
On the plus side, the CRISPR-cas modification did not affect his love of cheese.
You didn't tell me the mouse's name was Bond, James Bond.
Oh great, now we're going to have both 'flying rats' and flying rats in the city.
This is one of the rats from Silicon Valley, I assume?
But to the rats he's a superhero.
I know it’s for science but somehow it seems unfair.
Amazon is funding research to identify all options for faster deliveries.
Why go for the cheese if it can fly to freedom?
Operating heavy equipment, check.
Ha. He didn't weigh the escape options. Thrust or cheese? Thrust or cheese?
What I want to know is, who taught him the melody to "The Farmer in the Dell"?
Amazing--he's gained 4 ounces eating the virtual cheese.
I don't want the cheese, I just want out of the trap.
Are you writing this down Claire, his interest in the cheese has vanquished... interesting.
Please make a note: no more James Bond films before bedtime.
He just finished watching Iron Man.
Our research seems to have entered a new dimension.
M-a-c-G-y-v-e-r   M-o-u-s-e 
MacGyver Mouse
MacGyver Mouse
Forever let us ...
He seems hungry enough now to get through this maze to find the cheese.
Gluten free?
My name is Norvegicus, Rattus Norvegicus!
He's not on my specimen list either, but the investors don't need to know that.
Over an hour, blindfolded.
Don't you notice her throttle response gets better when it's Swiss?
Now if we can just give this to our congressmen
We didn't think outside the box.
he is afraid because the other two blind mice died in the maze
So.. where is the rat
Looks like he gave up on the mousetrap
Hyperpropulsion seems to be replacing hypercompulsion these days.
I told you building walls wouldn’t work.
it must have eaten the brain tissue that got lost during X-mass recess.
Dammit, Treadwell. It’s the prototype Musk Rat.
Now that we tested it on mice, how exactly do we get a large enough cheese block to get humans to use jet packs?
We should shut this experiment down before he learns to go nuclear!
Our next fear, rat drones.
I would try the Camembert.
I guess this means we will need a lot more cheese.
Jetpack for Algernon... what a great idea!
I think it's no a good idea to utilize the same rat in more than  twenty trials...
He must be amazed"
His name is Bond. Squeakers Bond.
These experiments with geriatric rats are getting just ridiculous.
This one gets a 5 on creativity, but I think we need to ask her how she filed the Q-tips.
What if I eat a bit?
So this is  the one you said likes Red Bull more than cheese?
What's next...cheese locator drones?
I don't think even Einstien himself could have predicted this was going to happen.
Ever since Baby Yoda came along Mickey's been going through some things.
These Epcot Center rats might not work out.
Next time be sure to use a less piquant fromage.
He says he's not one of the 'flyover' mice.
I told you we should have made the maze taller.
Have you been letting the test subjects watch YouTube again?
Maybe we should reconsider the military grant.
Rats. Amirite?
Validation has become highly specialized.
Is this the Democratic or Republican mouse?
You'll need to come up with some other reward. This one is lactose- intolerant.
Alright, who cut the cheese?
You remember that line from Jurassic Park where they talk about scientists being too preoccupied with "could" and not enough on "should"?
Yeah, me neither.
Don't you think this mouse is a-maze-ing?
The chart says it's a Double-0 rat.
You don't think they'll like cream cheese?
I don’t think he will tell us much about flying.
Algernon doesn't really care about flowers, but for cheese anything goes.
That mouse is really into The Mandalorian.
His union rep made a deal with upper management
She hacked into my Amazon Prime again.
How are you not “amazed?” Get it?
You get it? Isn’t it a-MAZE-ing?
It's obvious that this mouse is very technologically advanced. We should name him Elon Mouse-k.
For some reason it makes me think of Social Security.
Algernon says the cheese won't cut it anymore.
Well, it is green cheese from the moon.
Just imagine his potential if he had a Freedom Cheese Dividend too.
Hey Steve, do you remember our conversation about the criticism of the Bayesian approach?
They decided to Uber to a deli
Maybe the paper should be about the Hawthorne Effect?
The instructions say that if the mouse is recalcitrant, try an Energizer Bunny instead.
Well, at least this one is on a keto diet.
I hope she makes it
The hell with him,
Look for his plans
What if he's vegan?
Maybe we need to add  “ move solely under your own power” to the instructions?
They call him amazing but I still say it's cheating.
Buy more cheese, or, put on the roof assembly, your call.
you really think just because he can fly it, the injections are working?  He hasn't found the cheese yet.
Doubt he'll make it farther than Judy.
It turns out, the "Mighty Mouse" series was a documentary
Trials for a near-future moon landing.
Now I see why you named him "ThunderBall".
Well, I'm just lost for words.
I suppose this is his "Kobayashi Maru".
What hormones did we give this one?
He’s amazing.
We should have bought the one with the roof!
Quick, grab him before he sends a car into space.
Thanks to VR, he thinks he's making a landing onto a green cheese moon.
Well, this puts a stick of dynamite right up the ass of my hypothesis...
Can we move his friends out of here? He's showing off.
Can we pay extra for ones who aren't genre savvy?
He wants us to design an app so he can find it.
This mouse is much more advanced. He attached himself to a drone to get through the maze & find the cheese much quicker!
Don't look now.
You've cross-contaminated our experiment with the AI rats.
The lab rats have successfully made it to Gen Z.
He preferred the cheddar.
It's not organic.
Karen, we should stop feeding them novels.
We might want to call this emPOWERment.
Maybe we should switch from Super Sharp.
This took five rodent generations and the resultant epigenetic memories, and I still don't think he's going to end up getting the cheese.
the agoraphobia conference room is to the left all the way down

Sir, you do know that our “Mercury suite” isn’t actually Mercury, right?
He's just moused over the options.
You should see his cousin with the movie studio
Did he learn this from you?
... and you should hear its ideas for a new maze!
so, you thought mice are dumb, how would you figure your way out of there
He was a big hit with the flea circus.
Did you say you bought the mice on Amazon Prime?
We denied him his usual Red Bull supply
See, you are going to need a three dimensional maze.
I think it is time to write you paper, this study is clearly getting old.
You asked if he has any dietary restrictions, right?
I told you we should have changed the maze around.
I will vote for your President!

Gee whiz, Sue, that compound we synthesized from Elon Musk's tears really works.
well, someone's been watching McGuyver re-runs
It's the shortest distance to the cheese.
This stress test is not worth it
I think this one gets off for good behavior.
Do you think he will help out Elon if we add a side of Gouda?
Did you use the imported Swiss?

He says that he is lactose intolerant and that is the last time he is doing this.
With Big Tobacco out of the picture, we've turned to Tiny Rocket for funding.
If you want your research published you'll have to ignore behaviour that can't be reproduced.
She just doesn't seem motivated by cheese.
We can't use this data when we publish.  He must have stolen the patents when he was working at NASA!
His intuition as to the path to follow is supposed to help people like you"
Got any already in red?
I warned you not to name him Elon.
Uh-oh! It looks like that techie gang broke into our lab again last night.
Fly, Robin, fly...up, up to the sky!
Well, it passed the smog test, so he does get extra points for that...
It's Black Diamond cheese.
No go unless it's brie
These elderly rats sure know how to get to the cheese
Where's the control in this experiment?
Stuart! I told you no jetpacks at the dinner table!
Looks like we've got another lactose intolerant.
Wow. aMAZEing.
The intelligent mice quickly solved the maze.
Maybe there's an option we haven't considered?
scientists investigatng how long it will take the mouse to find the cheese
It must be the Gruyere; the ones chasing Cheddar are still in traffic, looking for a promotion, and checking their 401Ks.
Why do we use 2D labyrinths? It's obsolete.
Now I'm worried about that trap he's building.
Indeed, mice are smarter than humans.
He's not one of ours.
I told you that we’ve just got to stop using these mice with MENSA cards, it’s skewing our data.
They are in there somewhere.
Well, will you look at that, Franny Frumin!
Mouse #007 certainly has taken this experiment to new heights!!
What are we trying to prove here?
Yes, obstacles are my incentive, but’s it’s gonna take more than cheese, If you want this mouse.
Its called " the rat pack"!
The only thing new was the motivation training from HR held here last week.
He must have gotten bored with the maze!
Amazing way out!
The Rogue River Blue does drive some unique behavior.
He bought it online.
Think we should quadruple the dosage for the pigs?
The gene guys were instructed to use the celibate modification. Elevate option was reserved for politicians
There goes Fievel, a geek among Romans.
sorry, this is not going to work_he's a vegan
SpaceX funding is keeping the lights on.
Oh, RATS! I mixed up the Research Aptitude Test with the Remote Associates Test used to determine creative potential.
Rats are smarter than humans.
Let’s just hope he doesn’t have our addresses.
She may have flunked the intelligence part of the test,  but I still think it's worth noting in our study…
They've stepped up their game.
Well he did find his way to the USB port
It's the long-promised jetpack from Thunderball"! And the rat beat us to it!
Should we call it the rat pack jet or the backpack jet rat?
You don't suppose the cheese ate the mouse do you?
Well, now, how much are we in debt?
Look up! Look down! Look out! ... Squeak!
That is simply unamazing.
We've discovered cheese is a powerful motivator.
What’s even more impressive is that he’s already patented his tiny jetpack.
The design of your experiment does say the mouse would go blindly through the chutes for the reward.
Looks like they discovered Kickstart.
Do you think R&D time would be more impressive if we upgrade to the Camenbert?
Looks cool. Too squeaky.
We are scientists.
Mouse, cheese, rat race. Check. Now -- why do we keep doing this?
Due to the significant reduction in our funding we have to conduct our research significantly quicker
This is way better than when we gave the rat the acid.
We call that one Elon Musk Rat
Intelligent tech-savvy mouse triumphs animal testing by embarrassing outdated conductors
I told you we should never have accepted those research funds from NASA."
You know I keep forgetting to put this old maze away
Uh, this is all kinds of ways wrong!
Oh my goodness John, he'll be the first internet sensation of 2020.
That rocket equipment is from another lab. He’d better fly it back before it’s missed.
I'm trying to find a sales angle for it.
The Huffman/Loughlin step-skipping drug is working
She just hasn't been the same since Apollo 17!
Once he eats enough cheese the jetpack won’t help.
If he starts to teleport, we have tsuris.
He's ready - assemble the others.
I told you we should have put a lid on the maze.
Mighty Mice?  Ok.  How much do we need to budget for cheese?
Well that’s the first time the cheese c,are out ahead!
Oh my god, a rat!
Exposure to the subway commuters have led to drastic developments in their evolution!
He's going for the great cheese in the sky.
We captured him on the set of a "Red Bull" commercial.
We should've made the maze a bit harder.
This damn rat is smarter than us.
This is why we always wash our hands.
The jet pack rats consistently outperform the standard pack rats.
I suppose moon cheese would have been more apropos....
This is literally amazing.
I hope he likes fondue.
He only likes his cheese melted
Who’s going to cut the cheese?
Mighty Mouse is on the way!
ow where on earth did he go?
I gotta get me one of those.
It's a special breed called 'start-up rat.'
Did you leave the window open?
Clever, but I still think we should bring back the metal detector.
Yep...it's a mouse from Beverly Hills
Yup, still don’t understand what consciousness means
Welcome back Mrs. Portman! - My name Is Lucy.
Luckily,this qualifies as preclinical research,so we don't have to worry about reporting an adverse event.
I’m as perplexed as you are. Did the other two blind mice run after the farmer’s wife?
Maybe the aged Vermont cheddar was a bad idea.
What kind of crackers do you think it would like?
I guess we should check 'Impaired ability to play by the rules.'
All I did was switch the regular cheese with the vegan one.
Oh, I was expecting to see Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
Long flight, Sir?
We Call him Bond, James Bond.
Do you think the kind of cheese is important?
Maybe we should cut the dosage of hormones.
He's must be a distant cousin of Mighty Mouse.
They're going through a tech boom
He's not so tough without his Jet Pack !
Is it government cheese? If it is, the results might vary.
That idiot’s going to melt the cheese
How many vaccines did you give him?
reach the stars in our rooftop” don’t you  think?    It’s a bit exaggerated to
Yes, he knows how to use a jet pack.
Are you happy now, Clair?
He thought I said that he'd be trekking down a glacier . I said he'd be tracking down a glouster..
No, it's not more practical than a drone but at least this one fits inside my butt.
Now, I need a volunteer.
I think I saw something like this in an episode of Gilligan’s Island.
My pitch Is still a bit long.
Gravity is losing its force
spaced out
Does this elevator go any higher?
I think we’re gonna need a bigger elevator.
I will take a break from social media for couple of months. Please spare me some memes and good news about climate change when I’m back.
sir are you going to the space? no i'm heading to delhi
Excuse me, is this the  level of the Moon Headquarters?
Welcome to Mars, Mr Musk sir.
-Where can I take you Siz?  -Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars
This is as high as it goes.
Sorry, Sir. The elevator only goes till the 273rd floor.
I’m assuming you’re not going down.
Mr. Kubrick’s floor please.
Enough climate change for today?
Thats the wrong pianet...take me to planet 9!
Welcome to the Apollo 11, sir. A bit overdressed for the party if I may say so
My anxiety for this project has just skyrocketed.
I asked Captain Maze for his assessment.
Virtual Reality.   Really?
I know your kindly heart goes out to them, Lois, but you're invalidating the experiment.
She must have received a gift from one of her sponsors.
Use another subject, he's from the Behaviorist era.
They've just moved past this 20th century technology!
He's one of NASA's Mighty Mice in Space just back from the space station.
mice to men
I still say retired All Stars don't always make the best color commentators.
If you ain't willing to cheat for some cheese, you don't want it bad enough.
He really wanted that cheese huh?
I don't think we'll save the day.
I think Trump canceled aid to the disabled.
Everyone wants to be trump
Was raclette among our anticipated results?
It's smarter than you think
Well, that’s one way to slice the proverbial carrot.”
Will Hunter, Plymouth M
I know time flys but not that evolution flys
I have grate expectation's for this experiment.
Well, he's doing better than Woody Allen.
CRISPR
This is a real game changer trying to find volunteers is going to be a challenge. Getting them to sign a waiver and a non disclosure agreement is going to be difficult.
These are for the Transgenders
Breakthroughs in the study of lactose intolerance.
Give it time...working for the labs at NASA takes some getting used to.
Is he back from the Holidays?
When they gave us the money, they did say “Aim High”
whats with the jet pack? will he actually follow 
the maze?" "probably not.
Did you put Red Bull in his water bottle?
He found the Swiss loophole.
Wow. That must be really gouda cheese.
Well, you used French cheese.
It's a really fine hunk of Swiss
I told you we should've used gouda; the swiss makes them too hyper.
Well at least we taught them how to jump...…..
Why make them work so hard for a lousy piece of cheese?
I told you not to give him his pilot's license!
Check this out. He’s always been one of our most promising and ambitious subjects. Now he wants to see if the moon is made out of cheese or not.
Wasn't the maze.  It was the traffic coming here
This is the Swiss Mouse. They have perfected the initial reconnaissance flyover. He also jodels when he finds the cheese.
He's always a bit extra.
One great leap for mousehood!
By recording them faster and faster you can advance to Chief  Associate Researcher sooner than, you know who.
We have to build a better maze.
Oh my, I forgot his success rate includes Brie!
Should we strap a jet pack to the cheese to even the odds?
Puzzling...My margin notes said this one was "not exactly a rocket scientist."
My kid kept telling me they were smarter than me. Guess he was right.
Stan, stop posting pictures of me knitting snowman type knit hats!!!
Algernon shared with me that he would gladly retire from all of this with just a three-cheese-wedges-per-week pension and an occasional dumpster dive.
He goes flying off whenever he doesn't like the cheese.
Mini Pyrrhus wants to win, but he's lactose intolerant.
On second thought Dr. Klaus, I just don't think it's worth the trouble for the mice or the university.
We shouldn't have sent him to DeVry.
I forget, did this guy specify Vegan cheese?
There goes using Red Bull as the control.
Cheese!  How do you expect me to get that?
I think we need a roof.
Don't worry.  I only gave him 10 seconds of fuel.
And now, are you ready for… Charles E. Chénievel!
You had to name him Elon Mouse!
He wants to be called The Flying Cheeze and insists it does not violate the International Rules of Mazes.
He says he’s a 21st century LabRat
He’s on to us.
Time for low fat cheese
The boss called, Assembly Bill 5 is through and we have the go-ahead for trials. The marketing team is calling it the "Inclusive Economy".
I think the genetic mutations lab left their door open again.
Well they told us even a blind squirrel...
Look on the bright side, Darlene -- our research did lead to the Hovermouse.
I think they’re evolving faster than our research methods.
Wow!  This is one experiment that evolved in an unexpected direction.
Couldn't he just have used a drone to figure out the maze, lke everyone else?
I think is that mouse can find its way through this labyrinth humanity  must be able to get out of the mess it is in.
Oh dear, I think you forgot the bicycle lane.
Well, you know how it is with walls. . . .
Impressive......maybe, but they still can’t parallel park.
Wait. Let's see if he is psychotic enough to bait a mousetrap with it.
Where's MY jetpack?
He ordered it on line!
He has what they call "the right stuff."
Raton ready...set...
But it's still cheating.
Let's use smaller pieces of cheese-the mice are getting to big!
Later this year, they will be replacing us with robots, so you'd better make your pitch for that management position, now. And don't worry...you don't need any brains nor experience for any of those management positions.
He's gone all James T. Kirk on us and "Kobayashi Maru'ed" the exercise.
What is the matter with these mice? They always skip a proper IPO.
He says he's lactose intolerant.
This mouse should work for Amazon.
But Evette, he's no less impressive just because he was born with a  power pack on his back and a mouse hole in the Hamptons, right?
He needs to cheat to find the cheese!
I guess you could call it a
She was here a minute ago.  Oh, that's the wrong cheese.
The jetpack is a nice touch but we definitely have to upgrade the testing procedures.
It's for them, not for you
So much for Amazon Prime!
This new “maze-beater“ mouse-pack device is a real game changer.
Another one from the Musk tunnel?
No wonder he watched NOVA!
Great now we’re gonna need more cheese
Either he's dreaming of Jerry or we overdosed him.
Scorsese was right that those Marvel movies really are ruining everything
Well, there goes Elon Muskrat agian.
Rats! He passed with flying colors.
hopefully there will be enough space for you in this room sir
One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind ‘  ,Oh ok, you must be heading up to COP 25‘
Write your caption here  I just want some  me time
The Sky Lounge is not THAT high, Sir.
Talk about lack of motivation!
The cheese seems to frustrate them when they're lactose intolerant.
Innovation because the cheese stinks outside the box?
This one may be ready to break the fourth wall.
Flying for the
So....this is where the maze catches fire.
The subject seems to be super-cheesed about this particular maze.
We’re going to have to rethink the whole maze thing...
We shouldn't have done the experiment where we left him near the computer with a credit card.
They want him to be trained as a drone but he can't fly.
Our latest development, Mus musculus var. elonii.
If mouse #A1 fails to find his way to the men's room, this study is doomed, as is mankind.
This is the cohort that uses technology to manage the maze.
How did he know it was Hogmanay? I didn't think our rats had any Scottish DNA...
PETA sure has changed our experiments.
I haven’t seen that since the LA Olimpics
This is starting to get ridiculous, get Musk on the phone.
Jets fans are getting rattier every day.
First time I've actually seen thinking outside the box.
The young today: I told you we need to update our technology
Cheating is encouraged.
Oh oh, I think our shipment of mice got mixed up with the one's from the gene splicing lab
(Left): They're supposed to be in it for the cheese, not the 15 watts of electricity...

(Right): Sign of the times...
Looks like we have another Mickey Mouse.
Hmmm, we have a cheater in our midst
''No blindfold is unfair,give him a chance"
It's time to move on to 3D mazes.
Oh, sure, it does show that they can use tools, but somehow Psych 101 lab won't ever be the same again.
He just doesn't like swiss.
I can get you to the 20th,but for anything above that I should  really speak to my manager...
‘Lobby or Houston, Sir?
I’m sorry ma’am. It only goes up to the 30th floor.
I understand you, these days all we all need is more space.
I like a nice piece of swiss, too, but really?
Maybe we shouldn't put our invention on the market.
The splicing of Roger Moore's genes is a success.
We're going to have to boost that cheese budget.
This is the one from the New England Patriots clubhouse?
Edward, this gives new meaning to purposeful behavior.
No problem.  This maze has a handicap lane.
Maybe he wasn't Swiss?
It's Amazing Mouse!
Its amazing! He has survived ecery test!!!
Too bad he doesn’t know it’s Daiya cheese.
Don't tell the President, Cornelius.
He's really smart. Let's get our new coworker a little white lab coat, I D badge and clipboard.
Seems he can't land without melting the cheese ..
‘...,  And check his reaction when the cheese melts.’
He is the big cheese
The cheese is moldy.
I’m afraid your work will come to naught, Dr. Mason. 
Nobody likes a smarty pants, particularly in rats.
Last floor, please.
Let me explain the buttons to you, then you can take it from there
That's Elon Musk, he is a crafty one!
Well, this is going to skewer the
Sure Elon's rat will get there first, but will it eat the cheese?
Welcome Major Tom! great to see you back at ground control please leave your helmet at the lobby desk this season we have protein pills special merry christmas to you and your beloved wife!
Since Wonka’s Factory, Charlie had been playing it safe
One too many small steps for man today, sir?
The chair in Wonka’s  glass elevator was  Charlie’s suggestion; the Space suit is because everyone still knows what happened to the other  kids.
The cosmonauts drove up rates at Trump Tower, so here i am.
I will just check up on a friend and

Suite 4 please, 3rd bachelorette party of the night.
you’ve been a little spacey these days... we’re not seeing each other on the  same eye level
- Sir, do you go out alone tonight  - | - |need my space. |
Who let Elon Musk into the lab?
I suppose cheese will do that if you're a clever rat.
Yeah, Super Mouse is a good name
WTH?
Well, he got a birthday cake from his brother, yesterday......
Augh, I hate when the mice escape.
If the offer is good, they all come straight to the point.
We bred this strain to think outside the box.
He has started smoking Marlboro too
Other than forgetting the bathrooms, conference room and president's office, I think you did a good job.
OMG we've taught them to fly!
Could be the TV program about AI the lab staff was watching, but he has also has been sipping Redbull."
To be fair, it's not rocket science.
He's achieved lift but his directional stability is flimsy.
I'm sure he'll make it to the White House in no time
I think we're gonna need more cheese.
We need to replace that old cheese before the rats outside the building smell it.
Dibs on his cheese.
How in the hell did he get that?”
Don Dechman, Austin, T
I thought you said outlier not out “flyer”!
Do you really expect these rats to not squeal on us?
How did they get them before we did?
It’s amazing what he was able to build out of a mousetrap!
Tell him to pick up our pizza before he worries about the cheese.
He really likes Thunderball
His drone was broken
I think there is a statistical test that will fix this.
Just how many human brain cells did you give him?
Jealous?
It really seems it will be the year of the rat.
He's getting ready for Space Force.
I'm taking the University's interdisciplinary approach--combining Logistics with Aerial Engineering.
Do you think Little Minnie would let us cosign the patent?
He's gonna fondue it.
I think he's blowing us off.
He wants to negotiate for the cheeses!
PTSD in a rat?  You may share a Nobel Prize with me.
We aren't the only ones experimenting with a Space Force.
Turns out we should have kept that one glass ceiling.
Norwegian rat , german cheese?
Now that he knows the prize, he's ready to go for the record.
Didja have to make his landing pad so complicated?
I know. I thought *we* were promised jetpacks.
I think we need to stop using Pule cheese.
MIGHTY MOUSE IS REAL!
Didn’t we do the same one yesterday?
He's a political appointee.
I DON’T GIVE A RATS A** ABOUT THIS TEST
What? It was too cold in  my faux fur coat...
We found this one in the attic of Elon Musk.
They've become much more industrious since we switched to Murray's.
Do we give him points for cheating or do we demote him?
Science, bitch.
I told you we shouldn’t have fueled up his jetpack.
| don’t Know when they put in the elevator. I’ve only been here a week.
Allergy season strikes again
You cant go to- the moon with an  elevator,though
Perhaps you have taken the advice to bring protections for the date too literally, Sir.
Year 2050 “Heading out to Central  Park sir?”
Budget cuts?
Forgot my toothbrush.
Our rooms are large but not as spaciou as you could have imagined, sir
Mr. Douglas Adams is waiting you at the end of the universe
I just can’t believe he built a sound system in that thing. And he’s playing Korn!
But what if the rats are lactose intolerant?
I didn't have enough for breakfast. I'm tempted to eat that myself.
This is how underachievers are made.
Rejoice, Professor! We have taken lab rat experiments to new heights!
Apparently we are supposed to look for the cheese now ...
He only go through the maze  if its fresh Swiss cheese and not the packaged kind !
We finally programmed them to think out of the box.
I suppose if we put it underwater, he'll find scuba gear.
At least we know he's not a kangaroo rat.
when cats fly
I told you giving the ones getting the test drug lab waste to play with was a bad idea
Are you sure that they will like this cheese?
Technology has finally displaced the rat's internal algorithm"
Frank and Sammy's estates are suing us over the use of Rat Pack.
We should seriously think about some HOV lanes in there.
Do you think rats' intelligence is evolving faster than humans?
Grilled cheese for lunch?
We’ve decided to study the Elon Muskrat
He says now that it's his permanent home, he needs a roof for privacy.
I knew rats were smart, but this?
I told you not to name him Elon Mice
Congratulations! I think you've discovered our new mousetrap cheese
I bet you a highball on the rocks he will find his way out before I need to take my next Prozac.
Follow the directions.
Is that a foul.
They are on a strict vegan diet.
Somewhere beneath Disney Land.
Tell Elon, phase one is complete.
Let’s go back to using frogs.
I guess I always was confused about just what that send a mouse to college campaign was all about till now
The full yield of its total brain capacity is now about ten times that of our regular usage.
We're All tired, dammit.
You were right. They are going up and we are going down. Pretty soon rats will be taking over the world.
Maybe she’s late for dinner.
It might not give you wings, but the subject certainly is vitalized
He recently participated in the IQ experiment as well.
Something got lost in transportation; we should have used Swiss mice rather than French.
Of course these are just very preliminary tests for the new Space Force.
Well Monica, our gene splicing experiment has been a success...these rats now have dexterous opposable thumbs. I’ll start making more mini jet packs so we can start taking over the world.
Operator, I am trying to reach commander P.R. |  Johnson” “Ground floor for major | Tom it is then”
Yep, that’s what she Said. Space.

You seem a little  Spaced out today. Hope  you have a great day!
Oh so the moon’s not interesting enough huh?
No, my name is “toy not Houston 9 %  ‘, and yes, we all 7 have problems.
Do you think he will remember my elevator pitch?
All the way up? Very well, Sir.
Going up?” “Yeah ,why
Going all the way up?”
Rat's don't do crack
Now we know what happens when you give them Nicotine...
Are you sure virtual reality is the best way to do this?
You're here because you've overcome racism, but aren't you afraid of losing your stipend because you are a mouse hater?
His name is Elon Mouse and he's quite remarkable.
That explains why 'Die Fledermaus' was on loop.
Earl, the new guy from Jet propulsion is starting to piss me off! Me too Sharon me too.
Can we do that?
Wow, Algernon really got screwed
Now what do we do with it?
Well, I'd say their cognitive function is excellent.
This looks just like our work cubicles!  If I were you, I would forget partaking in the Swiss cheese in the fridge . . .
Only one candidate left.....
Wow. They’re almost ready for the squeak-ret mission.
I'd call that a successful trial, wouldn't you say?
I wonder if it runs on ethanol?
Amazing. Just a-mazing.
That's not all, Harold. He also makes fondue.
A classic 6 would have been less overwhelming.
I told you he prefers gluten-free cheese.
We’ll have to find a way to separate it from it’s pack mentality.
Maybe we shouldn't use the good cheese.
Well, he did land that big DARPA grant.
When we accept the prize, who should we thank first? Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.?
Sure, we're speeding up testing. But at least our testing is blind.
I guess we need to build a better mousetrap.
Now we know what happens if we show them ‘Mythbusters’.
Conclusion: Rats are not intelligent enough to fly away and be free from captivity
Still not bougie enough. He keeps going for the swiss over the brie.
And this is a maze... ing.
Maybe we can also publish in the Journal of Rodentia Aeronautics.
Well, it looks like mice can think outside the maze!
He said he was lactose intolerant.
I guess he's off lactose.
They're stuck. No goggle map for the cheese
I miss the old days when a reinforcer was a reinforcer
We're gonna need a different kind of maze.
Amy, did you show him the landing procedure?
A new space meme!
Here's to the ones who dream, crazy how that might seem
Have you heard when ours will be ready for testing?
This one is A-Mazing
Who is in charge of breeding these new intelligent rats?
Yeah your idea was way cooler than mine.
Never mind the rats, will you marry me?
Ya gotta hand it to him for trying Harriet.
I think the helmet was a better idea than padding all of the walls.
Where did they all go to?
He said that the cheese had  been aged properly.
Who knew jalapenos would kill a mouse?
He has made what they say about pigeons come true.
introducing....the Tesla cyber-rat!
The mice from Cornell have really advanced.
He transferred from the Jet Propulsion Labratory.
Yeah he's faster, but it's not as fun.
He had a bit of catnip before he set out.
‘’It’s time to stop thinking lab experiments on any animal are funny.’’
I agree, it's impressive. I just wish we hadn't blown our entire endowment building the little jet pack..."
He always does the maze the traditional way, but apparently just prefers a baked cheese.
Should we call this "tool use" or "escape skills?"
We named this inventive little fellow Elon Mousk.
sir, your chair...
I don’t know about the moon, but here we have landed safely on the lobby, sir!
That's odd. He was right here twenty minutes ago.
This is our hybrid specimen, the jetpack rat.
Did you get that mouse from the DNA lab?
I thought Mighty Mouse was a cartoon character not a drone.
Isn't this one named "MacGyver?"
Guess we know why Dr. Silton called him MacGyver.
My team concluded this mouse has a strong predisposition for claustrophobia.
Interesting, Hem and Haw didn't do that.
Are you sure that’s what she meant by | ‘needing some space’?” |
Up or down, Sir?”  “Up, my kid was drawing a masterpiece”
Ah yes, going all the way up! 47
Unbeknownst to Carl, elevator A had been designated ag an early testing site tor NASA gpace elevator program.
THE FORECAST IN FLORIDA...
Good morning, Mr. LaLiberte. So you were serious.
Apologies sir, but the elevator doesnt go any higher.
Where to?” Astronaut: “Outerspace

Going up. High up.
Please take one giant leap off the lift for mankind
Is this seat taken? Gota  long way up.
Do you have shuttle service here?
I’m ready for holiday season!
I guess it is today.... Good luck for your court hearing for divorce, sir!
Erm, going up?
New Listing! Open concept with  great flow. Tons of space. Views are out of this world. No washer/ dryer hookup.
Something is wrong h can’t find the cheese
Conclusion, a more sedentary lifestyle creates a "larger" rat.
Evolution... I think he grew that.
We should call it "The Dean Martin".
Damn it Jerry; I said no jet packs!
.Maybe he escaped from the Aerospace lab across the hall?
"The rat warned us this would happen. It says here we've been fired because we got the door sign backwards."
On the bright side, tonight's cheese board is going to be one for the books."
I knew we should never have asked MacGyver to be a researcher.
Elon Micek
I don't think this is what "learning the maze" exercise had in mind.
This "disruptor" business is getting out of hand
I'm beginning to question his college application.
Holy rats! This boy got more brain than us. Let's figure how to take him back to his primitive self.
Put me in, coach.
Another successful graduate from Trump University!
Lisa, did you give Elon Musk the key to the lab again?
I thought you said this mouse was in the control group.
Ironrat ... No more movies for this one!
Which supplier did you use?
Do you ever have the feeling that we’re being watched? You know. By a rat with a jet pack? Behind us, on the table?
We call her Hover Mouse.
Do you think he's on to us?

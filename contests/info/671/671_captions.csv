Armstrong? No, though I do get mistaken for Lance a lot.
It’s the swimming portion that I am most concerned with.
I think you misunderstood 'ironman competition'.
Whew, I'm a lot rustier than I thought.
It started as a crusade, now it's just a commute.
I always said I'd take up cycling when I hit the middle ages.
I said, '"Wear your Under Armour."
You won't believe how many people want to shoot the messenger.
Costume party?  No, substitute teacher, seventh grade.
It’s just until I can afford health insurance.
Anyone wearing spandex shouldn’t judge anyone’s else’s fashion choices.
It’s honestly more comfortable than the seat.”
It's your first Ironman, right?
Well the helmet would look stupid without the rest of it.
It started with wearing a helmet like everyone else. Then I scraped my knee, so I started wearing knee pads, then it sort of snowballed
First time biking in New York City?
It even comes with knight vision.
Water bottle? No that's WD-40.
Stay clear of magnet schools.
You said we were doing a century.  I picked the 13th.
No, no! The coach suggested UNDER armor.
Surely you joust.
Normally, I wouldn't send a knight out on a bike like this.
I’m putting metal to the pedal.
All attempts to pass me are feudal.”
Don’t ask. It was Amazon prime day.
This part isn't nearly as bad as the swim.
The bike?  It’s a $15,000 carbon fibre kit that weighs 3.4 pounds. Why?
I'm Medieval Knievel
Laundry day.
I just thought I was too old for Lycra and too young to die.
I'm in the middle age division.
It's New York, Mom.  Every day's a battle.
Laugh all you like, but I’ll get into the Met for free today!
On thy left, fair maiden.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
It’s cheaper than health insurance
Do you know where there's a White Castle around here?
Honey, I said NIGHT ride.
Do you know how expensive it is to keep a steed in Manhattan?
Out for your knightly ride?
I'm between insurance plans.
I really want to be like Lance. A lot.
Did you see a lion and scarecrow back there?
This is not what I meant when I told you to bring protection
It burns calories, protects me against falls, and I get terrific reception on my cell phone.
Let me guess: You’re a Knight in riding armor?
Right now?  I'm putting my metal to the pedal.
Not sure why, but my sponsor said all my clothes had to be under armor.
It’s SPF 150.
I used to race with Lance a lot.
I work at the White House.
Lycra makes me chafe.
Honestly the armor is not so bad, it's the chastity belt that's the killer.
It's my first Ironman.
At least when they door me, I have the satisfaction of scratching their paint.
Oh, you meant a night ride.
Obviously you have never ridden in this part of the city.
Are you sure your therapist wasn't using a metaphor?
My therapist said I need to get off my high horse.
Everyone just assumes I have a good reason.
And my pants leg STILL gets caught in the gear!
The horse is on backorder.
Well, you said you wanted a knight out on the town.
My mom is kind of overprotective.
My worst stage of a triathlon?  Probably swimming.
If you see a dragon on a scooter,
let me know.
Shirley, you joust?
Do you have any WD-40?
My wife took the horse today
You said to wear protection.
I wanted to be like Lance... a lot.
You have no idea what the Iron Man competition actually is, do you?
I'll admit, when I pre-ordered Tesla's "eco-friendly armored vehicle" for $70,000, I was sort of expecting a car...
It’s protection against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
What, you’ve never lost a bet?
The worst part is going to the rest room at Starbucks.
My wife says I’m having a middle age crisis.
You said on your profile ⁠— "looking for a knight in shining armor."
Do you switch to chain mail in hotter weather?
Make fun all you want; you have no idea how high my deductible is.
Can't talk now, I'm on a crusade!
You wanna know what looks weird?  Those stretchy black pants.
Navigating traffic and jaywalkers was a lot more fun before the police took away my lance.
It's laundry day, okay?
I think I'm lost, is this not the cartoon with the dragon from last week?
Going out for bagels doesn’t qualify as a quest.
Spandex makes my butt look big.
It's an easier way to get buns of steel.
History is cyclical.
The dragon was in last week's cartoon.
My kingdom for a horse!
I hate delivering for Round Table Pizza.
Aren’t you taking this Iron Man thing a little too seriously?
Joan of Arc, what’s yours?
I thought you said that this was an Iron Man competition
You invited me out for a "night ride"?
This is a cakewalk; the swim and the run are the hardest.
I thought you said “dress for a knight ride.”
It just got too expensive to keep a horse in the city.
You have to decide if the safety is worth the chafing.
I'm a bike messenger for Brinks.
I lost my healthcare coverage.
My lawyer told me to wear something court-appropriate.
You said we were going to see Queens.
No...I said dress appropriately for a NIGHT ride.
Sure, you're protected from concussions, cuts and scrapes but keep an eye out for lightning.
Its heavy, it hurts and its ruining my hair. But at least its not plastic.
Think we'll have enough momentum to clear the moat?
The best biking accessory for me has been WD-40.
When you drink and joust they take away your horse.
“How do I get to Queens?
Yeah, she took the castle *and* the horse in the divorce.
I’m heading home now; my knight shift is over!
Not bad for a Middle-Aged man huh?
I feel safer, but the chaffing is ridiculous.
I'm a little rusty, but I think I can make it.
Titanium, lighter than it looks and matches my bike.
Well, all I can say is the genius who invented Bike to Work Day never worked at Medieval Times.
Because it has a lower carbon footprint than my horse.
Well, I would look stupid in just the helmet.
I thought I was ordering gear for ‘Night’ cycling.
Do you think your second week in congress will go better?
When I set up my on-line dating profile I didn't literally mean I wanted a knight in shining armor.
You’re right—I can see better with the visor up!
Metal to the pedal, baby.
Of course I'm wearing a helmet, Mom.
These helmet laws are getting out of hand.
I am a knight in riding armor.
It's a tin speed.
The clanging is annoying, but worse is the chafing.
It won't help. He's still president.
My horse is still finishing the swim.
My mother is a little overprotective.
First time in New York?
To the Cloisters.  Why do you ask?
My other bike is a horse.
Nobody likes a knight in shining spandex.
You said let’s ride any time, so I chose the Middle Ages.
Because I consider the rest of my body just as important as my head, that's why!
Yes, the visor does mess with my peripheral vision, but that’s where the rest of the armor comes in.
I say “night ride” and your first thought is “knight ride”?
Lance-less Armstrong
This is nothing. The swim was a bitch!!
Mind if I set the pace? I'm a bit rusty.
So you change at work then?
Really lowers the insurance."
Turns out he wasn't a faithful steed.
OK, I’ll admit it. Under Armour would have been a better choice.
No, I said I wanted to go for a night ride.
I just got dropped from my parents health care coverage.
Yes,  it is really hot in here,  and stop calling me 'Rusty'.
I always imagined you’d be riding a white horse.
"You save time with the aerodynamics but any bathroom break takes all day."
On your left, m'lady.
Just the helmet? You must be new here.
I haven’t been on the road in ages.
I'll take it off when this street gets a bike lane.
You think Lycra chafes...
So, do you lance a lot  ?
I figured it was the logical thing to wear over my Under Armour.
I'm training for an Ironman.
It's cumbersome but cars feel threatened.
What makes you say I'm having a middle age crisis?
He who rests, rusts.
I voted for Trump.
Gosh, I thought my parents were overprotective.  Yours are, like, from the Middle Ages.
I think you dropped a gauntlet.
This is why you are single
Is this the way to White Castle?
Fair maiden...will this road lead me to Queens?
Passing on ye left!
My horse is in the shop.
It's cheaper than having health insurance.
I love the knight thing but I just can't ride a horse."
'It's hot and heavy, but I saved 20% on medical insurance."
My friends told me to buy under armor but that stuff is WAY too expensive.
It's been a while - I feel rusty.
Paleo is over. I'm going medieval on my body.
Not everyone can afford private health insurance, Jane.
With all the drive-by shootings, it was either this or a stretch limo.
In the long run, it’s cheaper than sunscreen.
Pardon me.  Do you happen to have any grey poupon?
I look ridiculous in bike shorts.
Listen Merlin, I want my horse back.
I'm a middle age biker.
But you said it was an Ironman triathalon
Overprotective mother.
I'm done swerving for jaywalkers
I think you're training too literally for the Ironman.
You know that only the helmet is required...
There’s not much work available since ‘Game of Thrones’ ended.
I have an overprotective mother.
Over Armour.  It’s a thing.
I'll tell you what, it's more effective than ankle weights.
I save 15 minutes cutting through the dog park.
Time to put some metal to the pedal.
I have a very high deductible.
Then tell me why do they call it an Iron Man?
I get stiff when it rains.
Now that I've tried both, I think I prefer the Under Armour."
'Tis a courtesy loaner from my farrier
It’s a 10-steed
I misread night ride.
Trust me. You’ll get practically the same noise by putting a baseball card in the spokes and it is sooo much easier.
Don't look now, I just saw the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse on two tandems behind us.
I said I was in the mood for amour
Pardon me, but do you have any W40?
'Thought I was getting a noble steed, not 6-speed."
Chivalry is dead, but not from a head injury.
It's not breathable, but it is stainless.
It's a Schwinn 10 steed
Sunscreen would probably suffice.
I cross-train with Shakespeare in the Park.
You're not fooling anyone Lance!
This helmet just doesn't work without the suit.
My insurance doesn't kick in until the end of the month.
It seemed easier than getting my brakes fixed.
It’s cheaper than healthcare.
This is not what I meant when I said you should use protection.
This kit received the highest rating on crash tests.
I haven't been riding in ages.
A neon green helmet? Sharon, you look like a nerd.
Your other bike is a horse?
Have you seen the way New Yorkers drive? A helmet isn’t enough
I know it's a bit clunky.  But when I fall down, I skin the asphalt!
I see you’re training for the Iron Man.
I had a horse and chariot, but parking was impossible.
Is my helmet crooked? I don't want people staring at me funny.
Courier for six years in Midtown.
....The weight actually helps on the way down to work.... I switch to my Age of Enlightenment outfit on the way home.
I'd race – if I only had the heart.
I'm on my way to knight school.
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
And on Fridays, I catapult to the city.
You insisted that the night ride invite didn’t have a typo. Well: this is where we find out who was right.
Honestly, I'm just happy I made it past the swimming leg.
No, just the usual parent/teacher meetings.
I just don't like how I look in spandex.
Yeah, I suppose the fixed gear is a little anachronistic.
It does give you a downhill advantage.
Difficult? This is a piece of cake after the swim leg.
I’m just saying that chain mail
 might be more breathable
I shifted into 17th century gear and this happened.
I asked for a noble steed, and I got this ten speed.
Without the rest of the outfit, the helmet just didn't look right.
Have you seen a white stallion by any chance?
Don't tell the Met Museum staff that you saw me.
The cabbies don't seem to notice, but it freaks out the SUVs from Jersey.
This museum job is killing me.
I said I like cycling AT night!
Just found out my agent sent me to the wrong audition .
A friend told me to try knight riding. I wish he would've texted me.
I avoid hills like the plague.
Can't talk now. It looks silly being on a bike with a phone.
My lance is still stuck in the BMW that tried to run the red light.
Statistics show that cycling takes more lives every year than jousting. So, no Karen, I don't think it's "too much".
It's not a water bottle. It's 3-in-1 oil.
You wouldn't need all that armour if you just put your phone away!
It blocks 99% of UV rays!
Joust do it
Chivalry is going down hill.
I may have to stop soon for an oil change.
Wait, you said Under Armour?
And you think Gore-tex and plastic will protect you
Last time I was sweating this much I had the black plague.
Who do you think you are...Evel Midieval?
I have overprotective parents.
I just assumed that's why they called it the Ironman.
You can see it, too? I thought it was only emotional.
So the horse is in the shop?
On ye left!
I have a meeting at The White House
It's the swimming leg of these triathlons that's really killing me.
The helmet is the law. But I figured why stop there?
I said cyclists need 'mettle' not 'metal'.
Did you see a dragon pass by? She is winged, green, and riding a ten-speed with a basket.
Well I'm certainly not going into battle in spandex.
Forgive me for passing fair maiden, for I am most tardy for my shift at Medieval Times.
I am checking the weather forecast.  If it rains I'm screwed.
When you said you were going to pick up the mail...
My other bike is a dragon.
It's only until they make enough protected bike lanes.
I am your Knight In Riding Armor!
Mettle. I said it's a chance to test your mettle!
The horse got the cab.
Lighter and breathable without the chainmail, and still car repellent.
Look - if you're going to the Cloisters, you should dress appropriately.
Yeah. I kinda got tired of Hot Yoga so I thought I’d try something new.
Does this suit of armor make my butt look big?
It's a two speed: canter and joust.
Why yes, I am a Connecticut Yankee.  Why do you ask?
Forget the water bottle, I need an oil can.
I find high-intensity training really keeps me in shape for pillaging.
When I turned 40, I entered the Middle Ages.
Over Armour, Under Armour -- what's the difference, I said.
I think you took a wrong turn of the century.
Just wait until midtown. You’ll see.
Looks like another knight on the town.
My kingdom for a breathable breastplate
How bad is the noise in the rain?
Because a yellow jersey would be ostentatious.
Turns out my horse wasn’t carbon neutral.
Do you know how impractical it is to have a horse in the city?
I'm late for the caption contest of two weeks ago
My parents won't let me stay on their insurance."
Actually, it's a 10 steed.
you must be Knight Rider.
So, when you said you were looking for "a knight in shining armor"  that was just a metaphor?
The city lacks horse lanes.
Didn’t fanny packs go out of style like 20 years ago?!
“I used to avoid exercise like the plague. Then I got the plague.”
My new health insurance policy has an armor-clad accident clause.
If you think this is overkill for protection, you should see my condoms
I tell people it cuts wind resistance, but it's really because I hate bug splatters.
Spandex makes me itch.
I got it at the Met gift shop.
I'm a freshman Congresswoman. Did you see the President's tweet?
Didn't you hear? This is de Blasio's latest plan for protected bike lanes.
This is the easy part; the first part of the triathlon was swimming.
It's SIR Fred, Actually. Why do you ask?
I admit, I was a little unclear on what was meant by night riding.
That cloudburst caught me by surprise, too.  Don't suppose you have any WD-40.
Can I call you back? I'm getting pulled over by a cultural appropriation activist.
I ordered a suit for NIGHT riding...I guess there was a little misunderstanding.
Oil can...oil can.
I thought you said you wanted to be "joust" friends.
I’ve got a really high health insurance deductible...
I told you I was a road warrior.
That swimming leg was not easy.
first a helmet. then one thing let to another.
It’s a startup dating service called Knight Out.
I'm a bicycle messenger by knight.
Yes mom, I'm wearing my helmet.
I've started a meal delivery service called, "A Knight on the Town."
So I ordered an armoire but got this instead. So close.
I fall a lot.
I feel safer, but I’m afraid to drink any water.
Yeah, like that’s the first time I’ve been asked if I’m the Knight Rider.
Once I picked out the helmet, I had to get the rest of the outfit.
Cycling in the city is bloodsport these days, eh?
My horse refuses to ride past Trump Tower.
Extra precaution. We may run into Lance.
I'll do the run,  but not the swim.
Leave me alone lady, chivalry is dead.
Our club is called, ‘Knights of the Round Tire’.
I'm gonna go midieval on any cars in the bike lane.
Truth be told, it's only made me more reckless.
I fall over a lot.
No it's not Chanel; it's WD-40.
Have you ever tried using the bike lanes in this city?
I don't think that's what Ironman Triathlon means.
I just love knight riding.
My mother is a bit protective.
I think you misunderstood when I said I wanted a night ride.
Did you happen to see a horse go by here?
I'm less worried about falls but more worried about rain.
Anything’s better than those unsightly bike shorts.
Way more eco-friendly than that hay-guzzler I had before.
I do not have intimacy issues!
Want to go back to my place?  I've got protection.
Me? I'm training for the Ironman competition.
Brooks Brothers, why?
It’s laundry day.
Did it come with an iron-clad warrantee?
You had to ask if my shoulder itches?
I haven't met my deductible.
This may look stupid, but's it is still cheaper than paying my health insurance deductible.
‘First Time crossing the Williamsburg Bridge during rush hour?’
But women tell me I look hot.
I crash a lot.
But soft! At yonder light, thou brakest.
It doesn't wick very well, does it?
Humm...padded codpiece.  Good idea!
I'm getting metal fatigue!
I think I'm getting rusty
We made it past Jeffrey Epstein's building, Mom.
Marty, I lost the Delorean
I know, but I just really hate spandex.
It's hard on the hills, but fantastic in pile-ups.
On thy left, m'lady
Tricycle mishaps when you're six never leave you!
I can’t understand why you spent all that money on a lightweight bike.
This bike seat is so uncomfortable.
Honestly Harold, don’t you think you’re carrying this renaissance theme too far.
Does it wick?
What if you fall and can’t get up?
I thought you said knight ride.
Sorry I thought you said Knight ride.
My knight job is now my day job.
Think I lost some time on the swim leg.
God, how ridiculous did that bloke in the green Lycra look?
Oh, I thought that is what "Iron Man" meant!
I took the meaning of Iron Man Race too literally.
I wanted Under Armour, but all they had was Full Body Armour.
I believe in defensive riding.
My other bike is a steed.
They ran out of Under Armour.
If they try to kill the messenger I'm ready!
Don't you get metal fatigue?
I think you misunderstood Night Rider.
Cycling home from work can be pretty tough after a knight shift.
Yea, it's heavy; but it's also SPF 1000.
I'm not looking forward to the swimming segment.
Bike helmets make me look dorky.
My ass looks huge in spandex.
This is how you survive rush hour traffic as a bike messenger.
This isn’t the Iron Man Competition?
Hold on. Got some a-hole giving me the evil eye for phoning while riding.
By chance have you seen the dragon from last weeks cartoon?
Turns out defending the King is nothing compared to biking in Queens.
I’ve gotta pull over and get the bugs out my grille.
No, my mother isn't over-protective. Why do you ask?"
First time biking on the Brooklyn Bridge?
So... you prefer heat rash to road rash?
What? I thought you said a bike and shining armor!
It helps if you're going to ignore traffic signals.
No, once again, this is not Medieval Knievel!
I said buy UNDERarmor!
Technically it's not historically accurate, but have you seen the price of horses?
It lowers my health insurance premium.
The City Council has really gotten out of control with these new helmet laws.
Now they worry they may damage their car.
My horse got a flat so I had to improvise.
We're riding through the Bronx; I want to be prepared.
Safe, sure.  But try to find an armor-friendly restroom.
It works best at full tilt.
Last I remembered, I told Merlin to make my lance and armor strong.
No one respects the bike lane anymore.
You missed the Camelot exit.
Sure, I sweat a lot, but I also do more damage to cabs than they do to me.
Who needs reflectors when you have shining armor.
Dress for the job you want.
It was cheaper than my deductible.
I mean, I'd prefer a bike lane.
'Find a Unicorn' they said. 'It'll be a fun quest,' they said.
It's arrow dynamic.
It's not an entirely accurate reenactment.
They said it was an Ironman Competition
Your first time on the 405?
Working knights?
Middle Age is just a number.
You’re saying Under Armour is something different?
Yeah, it’s great as long as it doesn’t rain.
Mom, I still don’t see how taking knight classes is supposed to help me get a job...
You must be new to New York.
Yup.  I'm an urban legend.
I gotta tell you... one knight stands are the BEST!
I know it won't save me but the next car that runs me over is going to have a costly dent
Lance!?
''Yikes, I've got to rescue a damsel in ten minutes.''
The uphills are brutal but the downhills are fantastic!
I am my mom's only child.
WD40 break??
No, Ma, I'm NOT wearing a mouthguard!
It's rain, car, and cab resistant.
I'll take it off as soon as my Mother cannot see us
I told you I have a knight job.
You did bring the WD-40 didn’t you Lois!!?
I said “night ride!”
Yes, ‘tis true. Biking is both a noble quest and a pain in the butt.
I said UNDER armour is good for biking.
I don’t care what time it is. The Knight is young and I’m on my way over.
This chain mail wedgy is driving me nuts!
It's time for drivers to fear the cyclists.
It also repels White House tweets.
I'm training for the Tinman competition
I don’t know about you, but I heard your coach say train IN Under Armour, not UNDER armor.
It's not that kind of ironman competition....
I'm in the extreme witless witness protection program.
When I said 'Let's go for a night bike ride,' I never expected THIS!
I prefer over armor.
Now when they honk, I just say 'Ni!'
Now if I don't crash, I'll feel cheated.
It's from a company called OverArmor
I bet I can beat you to the bottom of the hill.
It suits you.
Because lycra looks ridiculous.
Might you be in distress?
Don't you know that fashion is cyclical?
Prithee, I be on thy left, my lady.
Lancelot Armstrong, milady.
Have you seen a dragon on a unicycle?
I got bullied as a kid.
I’m a little rusty
How did you know this was my first century?
I’m a bit worried about the swimming part of the Ironman.
I feel ridiculous without my lance.
My other ride is at the vet.
These new bike lanes are worse than running the gauntlet.
I couldn't resist the free shipping.
If you didn't want to be seen biking with me all you had to do was say so.
Are you sure this road will lead to Queens?
So I realized, some day my prince WON'T come, and decided to be more proactive.
I sure hope it doesn't rain.
Uber armor
Of course it's a steel frame.
Yes...you actually can be too safe.
I just wish I could shower and change once I get to work.
I meant that our biking group is middle aged.
Do you know how expensive it is to board a horse in the city?
Ask me if I care whether a self-driving car would stop for me.
Recycling the old Crysler seemed like a great idea.
This is nothing.  You should see me in my yoga class.
Of course I know how, I'm just a little rusty.
No, the Renaissance Fair was last week
True, the aerodynamics are great, but I'm a tad concerned about the swimming portion."
Aren't you glad you weren't raised by my mother?
I admire your mettle.
I dress for the job I want.
My commute doesn’t have any bike lanes.
I've been invited to the Round Table for lunch.
It doesn't breathe, but it's very durable and stain resistant.
I'm only wearing Under Armour today.
It's even more difficult in  yoga class.
On your lefte.
I started with ankle weights then I guess I got carried away.
I know there are no dragons. You know there are no dragons. But do the dragons know?
I can’t believe it! This woman next to me is dressed like she’s in the Tour de France. People are so crazy these days.
When I said Middle Age I was referring to the difficulty level.
I thought this was an Iron Man competition.
Me?  I 'm going to New Jersey
'The helmet is mandatory; the rest is just a matching outfit.'
As part of my cruelty-free knight services, I don't so much "slay" dragons as I "relocate" them to their native habitats.
A horse, a horse!  My fiefdom for a horse!
Crazy, right?  I was going for Steampunk and wound up totally Renaissance.
It's my personal quest so don't judge.
Just on my way to my knight job.
Our studio isn't as spacious as the tower but at least we moved out of her mother's place
Sure, there’s chaffing. But it’s worth the peace of mind when riding in the city.
Jousting hasn't been the same since I made the switch.
When I asked you to wear protection, I didn't have this in mind.
Dressing for the job you want has its disadvantages.
Yeah, well, "Polycarbonate Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
Yeah, it's heavy, but I have one of those "Help I have fallen and I can't get up" buttons
I'm wearing Under Armour too.
Bought it from some guy named Arthur.
I know it's insane but so are these unprotected bike lanes.
It's not about safety. It's about being noticed.
Why does everyone assume I'm from Connecticut?
Yes, I was overprotected as a child. Why do you ask?
Look, it’s Central Park. I’m taking no chances.
It's allowed me to get off the pill.
You wouldn't believe my cell reception.
If you must know, I got the suit from an armadillo in Amarillo. The hair came from a fair in Bonaire. I stole the bike.
...Because I realized the similarity between being hit by a jousting lance and a car door.
Okay, so I ordered the wrong 'Night Rider' outfit.
Can't talk now.  I'm in a different dimension.
I’ve found that ‘protected bike lane’ is a misnomer.
I thought they said this CBD stuff wasn't psychoactive.
Yeah but I’m still ahead of you.
The boss man replaced ‘Casual Friday’ with ‘Cavalier Friday.’
Have you seen a scarecrow with a lion around here?
You must not know about the pigeons.
Does it wick well?
You're wearing Under Armor, I'm wearing Over Armor.
One too many potholes.
Medieval exercise is the new caveman diet.
Weight training, aerobics, and self defense - all in one!
It does wonders for right of way.
It’s actually carbon fiber.
Not only that, but the SPF is like, super-high!
There are no bike lanes in my neighborhood.
To seek and find the holy grail, obviously.
Yes, it's true.  One day your prince will come, but not today.  Now beat it.
Why yes, I am training for an Ironman.
I'm feeling a bit rusty today.
Hey, buddy, I think you missed your turn centuries ago.
It's a little heavier than spandex but not as silly-looking.
I spent a lot of time in the Turret de France.
We don't do plastic where I come from
I’m on my way to Canada just in case this piece of shit gets re-elected.
Yeah, I know, but to get the cheapest personal health insurance rate...
Which century ride?
It’s available in carbon, Kevlar, and titanium actually.
I hope this works. There are a lot of dogs on my route.
Yeah, the carbon fiber frame really cuts down on weight.
Metal to the pedal!
It's a one-steed.
I'm allergic to horses.
Although I still regret misinterpreting "Ironman", it's not so bad now that I've completed the swim portion.
Yes, it's my first Iron Man.
Yes, I'm a knight of the round tire.
It was either this or a ridiculous deductible.
You know they make reflective biking gear now, right?
I'm telling you, I'm gonna get this "Medieval Kneivel" thing to stick.
It's uncomfortable, tiresome, and slow. On the plus side, no manure.
Passing on your left 600 years ago.
Forsooth my lady: I passeth on thy left. Fare-thee-well.
I know most people sign a waiver.  But I'm self insured.
I just wear a helmut now that there are dedicated bike lanes."
It prevents inner thigh chaffing and crotch soreness but the downside is rust.
It’s my anti-fast-fashion clothing line: Over Armour.
Who said you need to stop riding a bike in the city just because you don't have health insurance?
Can I at least be your knight on a shiny bicycle?
I'm really regretting those garlic fries right now.
Trying to ride with this helmet is feudal.
Omigosh, it started when I got some chain mail.
'Tis I, Lancelot Armstrong."
I'm a bit rusty.
You dropped your Lance, Armstrong!!!
Strip-o-gram at Belvedere Castle.
Sounds like you need to oil your chain-mail!
Don't worry, the steel is organic AND Fair Trade!
So I said to her 'Don't stare at me like that. You're the one who said you wanted a knight in shining armour'. Then she just did one of those  shrugs  and left.
I'm chafed in places I didn't think were possible.
Can I borrow your water bottle? Mine's filled with oil.
Wow! I thought I had the oldest riding gear around. Where'd you get that fanny pack?
Did you expect me to say something cheesy like “Nice knight for a ride”?
Why am I wearing plate armor? Because my chain mail kept getting caught in the front gear.
It's the only sunblock guaranteed  to work.
I haven’t quite recovered from the end of Game of Thrones.
My horse is on maternity leave."
You did say a Knight ride didn't you?
SPF  200
See? When it gets hot, I can lift the visor.
When I court a lady, I do it old school.
UNDER Armor?  What's that?
My noble stead’s in the shop.
With everything going on in the world, a tin-foil hat wasn't enough.
They said it was a Knight Ride!?
I just got tired of the cat-calling
Oh, they didn't say "metal to the pedal" ?
I heard there was going to be a Trump rally.
Can you please stop critiquing my form? I know I'm a little rusty.
Not everybody can pull off spandex.
My time?  My time was 500 years ago.
The things you do for insurance discounts.
How many times have you been hit by a car?
It was cheaper than buying healthcare.
The battle starts in 15 minutes.  Pick up the pace, sweetheart!
You should consider upgrading to carbon fiber.
This isn't how I expected to meet my knight in shining armor.
He's in pretty good shape for being middle-aged
You have any WD-40?”
Don Dechman - Austin, TX
What makes you suspect that I’m the one who used a lance to  knock  your friend off her bike?
Well, they said it was an iron man race.
They did say iron man.
I’m training for the Iron Man
Chastity belt's the worst.
'Excuse me, where did you get your water bottle?'
See ya'. I have a lunch reservation at The Algonquin.
..and I never got back on that horse again.
I thought you said we should ride all knight
It's OK Mom.  It's just a bike ride in the park for a first date, and yes, I bought protection in case he has ideas.
Let’s see that junkyard dog try to bite me now.
It’s my day-to-knight look.
Daily. But lately I’ve been riding knightly.
I find it breathes better than lycra.
So this English guy calls, and asks for delivery by a fort knight.
It's from the Met's fall collection
Without the whole gear, the helmet alone makes me look ridiculous.
Can we stop at White Castle?
There's something weird about this city.
I’m in training for my first Ironman.
Yes, he said 'knight shift,' but it was over the phone.
I hate when our boss plans a battle on Bike to Work Day.
The downhills are great.
Yes, it is heavy, but it works better than your underarmor.
Over Armour® just doesn't have the same appeal.
you could have worn sunscreen, ya know.
'Jesus, Fred, you were supposed to buy Under Armour.'
Get jousted just once and you'll understand
I read the consumer warning that came with the bike.
After this I'm going to my serf lesson
Wow, and I thought I looked like an asshole.
I could get used to this horseless horse.
It’s the only way I feel safe on the road with all those scooters.
You must be from out of town.
It produced too much methane.
It’s an airbag for bicycles.
Training for the Ironman?!?
On ye lefte, peasant
Swimming can be the toughest part of an Iron Man Triathalon.
Why stop at a helmet?
On the bright side: no more dry-cleaning!
It's an advantage in this leg of the triathlon, but I'm worried about running.
I should be making better time but I’m a little rusty!
You think that plastic helmet's gonna help you?
I had no idea there was a Tour de Camelot.
It's a low budget sequel to Knight Rider.
Well, it’s practical, and I’m Mitch McConnell’s daughter.
Embarrassing? Well, the drivers are too busy with their phones to notice me anyway…
First time on the parkway?
I had to buy it. This was the only model with a codpiece.
It's no more stupid than your outfit!
I went in for a new helmet and they sold me the matching protective suit half-price
My horse quit to work for Uber.
SPF  1 million.
PETA won’t let me joust with a horse anymore.
It's like a horse, but you don't have to feed it.
Jousting is great, but getting there is a pain.
I can win if I make my lance arm strong.
I stared feeling bad for the horse.
If someone tries to hit me I'm taking the car with me.
Oh! You meant "night riding".
I said let's go for a night ride not a knight ride.
My mom worries a lot...
I want to be noticed, and I hate the way my butt looks in spandex.
This is New York City, so, no, I'm not overdoing it
With all the distracted drivers out there, just a helmet doesn't cut it anymore!
I‘m the original knight rider!
I didn't spell-check my order for Under Armour.
Do you quest here often?
You don't need to be my knight in shining armor everywhere we go.
Because it's much cheaper than health insurance.
You said it was Joust around the corner
How did you guess I have an over protective mother?
Thou shalt not pass!
I say we call it a knight.
First time biking in the city, eh?
It’s not so bad, but I passed on the matching bike shorts.
I though you said you wanted to go for a knight ride.
It's vintage athleisure.
You never listen, I said “under” armor.
No, I'm not jesting.
I circle the park because I'm Sir Cumference...
I miss my steed.
"I moved here for the knight life, but so far it's been pretty disappointing!"
Maybe you're starting to break down my armor.
Jousting horses have a surprisingly large carbon footprint.
Now that the swimming portion of the triathlon is over, I'm not too worried about the rest.
I have meetings today, so I have to wear a suit.
You're either an extra in Spamalot or just assuming you'll be hit in an unprotected bike lane.
Horse's day off!
It IS my first time in the big city. How could you tell?
I said N-I-G-H-T ride!
Trying to decide which is worse, road rash or heat rash.
I just feel like such an anachronism.
The good news is I no longer fear Dodge Chargers.
It's SPF 1150 AD
Is that a water bottle or an oil can?
Didn't you use to ride with a Lance?
Wow! That’s not exactly what I meant when I said I had a thing for Night Rider.
It's so hard to rent a horse in the city.
I'm pretty sure the clanking is on your end.
OK, got it. Algonquin, main dining room, usual table, noon. I'm on my way!
I was able to do the running portion, and the biking part is going well, but I'm worried about the swimming part!
Why stop with a tin foil hat?
On thy right, m'lady!
I've been invited to a Republican cocktail party; I just want to be safe.
I'm training to be an Iron Man.
It's the only way I'll get the full discount from my HMO.
Nice knight for a bike ride!
Pothole and a time vortex up ahead on your right.
It was an eco-decision, really. Fiery steeds drop a lot of manure.
I said I just wanted a helmet but they threw in the whole suit for free!
Trust me, you'll never look back once you start using a helmet with a visor.
Are you hot? I'm hot.
It’s called overarmor!
You're safer behind me going downhill.
Wuddaya mean the mail must go through?
You said I'd 'hit the wall' after 20 miles... I'm ready!
I like to think I'm reriding history.
Meet you at the round table
It's a requirement to keep my life insurance policy valid
Tell Trump to "Go Fuck Himself"
I'm a bit rusty, but I can still do a pretty fast loop unless it rains!
I said you should wear Under Armour, not be under armour.
The swim didn't sink me, so I'm feeling pretty good about the marathon.
It beats the hassle of changing at fencing class."
Only problem is the rain
Mark my words, this will be the goat yoga of the 2020s.
I thought I told you it was a knight ride.
All this, and I still swallowed a fly!
It's like riding a horse.
umm...when I suggested a night ride...
My ass still hurts.
Biking in this city is war.
Easy... Cars, bullets, dogs.
Oh, you said Under Armour?
There is a city wide dragon alert.
I'll put my metal to the pedal and be there soon.
It’s a lightweight aluminum frame
I think you misunderstood the "Ironman" concept.
Ya, and I paid $7,000. for this eleven pound bike.
You did say get under armor.
I've just been feeling so vulnerable lately
Heavy metal thrills me, you too?
The heat's not so bad. It's the humidity that gets you.
Yes I’ve confirmed the reservation tonight for the Round Table and yes you have a seat.
You forgot your Pike.
Oh, Under Armour
I balance the toxic masculinity with a touch of environmentalism.
Wait, so what do you mean when you say Under Armor?
I'm a crusader for bike lanes.
Yes. Bicycle Jousting.
When we turn left on Broadway, watch out for the jackass on the big white horse 
who is always talking on his phone.
This isn't King's Highway?
You said dress for a rough ride.
Be honest — do you really wear all the clothes in your closet?
I didn't realize you said I should try wearing UNDER Armor
Don't look, I used to pillage that city...
I'm training for the Ironman Triathlon.
Well, people look at you funny when you ride a horse these days
I find I only need the lance during my commute.
You do realize we’re entering New York?
It's a new brand of protective outerwear.  "Over-Armor."
Think you’re taking the helmet law a bit far?
My rape armor.  I'm riding by Trump Tower.
It's obvious you haven't been doored!
I had to... I’m sponsored by Over Armour.
I've been one with the pavement once too often.
Sorry, I came here straight from work.
When I said we should meet for a night ride, I didn’t mean it literally.
Putting your pedal to the metal, I see.
They’ve added a triathlon to the renaissance festival .
I don’t know. What do you think an "ironman" is?
Have you good knight vision?
I heard the ticks are really bad this year.
It was a great offer and the helmet is free!
It's Tour de France, not War de France.
Yes, Mom, I remembered my helmet.
Ride up beside me, will ya? and oil my knee.
I’m telling you Joan, the Tour De France is for men only.
They put in a new jousting lane through downtown.
It's only until the cars are driving themselves.
I'm here to rescue you from bad drivers.
I am your knight in Shimano armor.
I think you've taken your obsession with Knight Rider a bit too far.
M'lady, my eyes are up here.
The City as testing these as a cheaper alternative to putting in bike lanes.
What?! Girls always say they're looking for a knight in shining armor!
A Raleigh, I presume.
Arthur, I want a divorce.
Did I mention all the pigeons in the park?
It has its drawbacks but I'm never less than 5 bars.
You do know that swimming is the next leg of the triathlon?
Ever since they voted not to put in a bike lane.
Wait, so when you said you go on a nightly ride ...
The Game of Thrones protest is just ahead on the left.
Listen kid, food delivery is an ugly business
I'm training for the Tour de Lance.
I just got a gig at the Museum.
It's called passive safety.
You're right. Chain mail would have been the better choice.
It's hard to be a saint in the city.  Much less a knight in shining armor
Are you in distress perchance?
Someone needed to restore chivalry to city biking.
I know it won't save my life, but I want to cause some damage if a drunk, distracted, or angry road hog hits me.
It's the Ironman Triathlon, what don't you get?
There were too many damsels that were distressed.
Yesterday I was passed by a truck driver with a burger in one hand, a phone in the other and a crazed grin on her face. Enough said, right?
Maybe I did misinterpret what this Ironman competition was all about.
I feel safer, but I can only really ride downhill.
I was shopping for Under Armour cycling gear and hit ‘’buy now” by accident.
I think you're looking for the IRONMAN race, not the TinMan race.
It's great to finally meet someone emotionally available.
'Tis my horse's mandatory one-hour lunch break.
Training for the Ironman is harder than what I thought.
The suit of armor was cheaper then my deductible..
It pairs really well with the Paleo diet...
So I said, look like a damn fool, or die.
My Under Armour didn't work out so well. So, I thought I would give Over Armor a try.
It’s no more uncomfortable than the seat.
Get a horse!
My new sponsor wants me to peddle his ‘Over Armour’ riding gear.
I knew I’d be training for the Ironman Triathlon, but this is ridiculous.
Once I bought the helmet, I couldn’t resist getting the whole ensemble.
Tough neighborhood
Thank goodness for Under Armour.
It’s OK on the open road , but once you get into the cycle lanes you need all the protection you can get!
There will be a guard from the Metropolitan Museum coming up behind us shortly. There's a miniature Van Dyck in it for you if you cut him off.
Damn! I knew I signed up for the wrong Ironman.
This whole safety-versus-fashion thing is a false choice.
Knight rider on your left, fair maiden
I'm sponsored by over armor.
What do you mean, this is not the Tour de Lance ?
I am just going to knight school .
When you follow a Cartoon Caption Contest with a dragon, you have to be prepared.
Well, my Under Armour's in the wash.
If I win the big prize at the joust, I'm upgrading to a Prius.
We’re having a round table at the office.
Reduce - Reuse - Recycle!
I'm following Rail to Trail to Grail
What, you've never heard of knight rider before?
I don't think that's what they mean by an iron main competition
Because horses don’t belong in the city.
When I said ‘suit up,’ I had thought you understood in what context.
So you know how the brakes work, right?
The best part is, these greaves never get caught in the chain!
Sorry, I’ll be out of here in a second. Just passing from one wormhole to the next.
Did you hear thunder?
I'm  ready for the commute home 
during the rush-hour traffic!
If you knew my mom . . .
You ever try to cross through West & Albany at rush hour?
I prefer to joust with oncoming traffic.
I thought it would look more sophisticated than training wheels.
My insurance carrier is really strict.
Look, I am just on the way to slay a dragon on Fifth Ave., and defend the princess shopping there.  Keep up with the times!
There is the chafing, sure, but honestly it's the only safe way to bike to work in Seattle."
Yeah, I'm the Knight Rider, nice to meet thee.
It's nice to see a Citi biker wearing a helmet for once!
Now, when I go down, I give the 'rash' to the road.
I think that minivan got the worst of it.
I thought sunglasses would look ridiculous with this outfit.
It's like Uber, but for jousting
My contact lenses are bothering me.
Well, I tried to rent a horse
These new lightweight rims make the commute so much easier.
My mom is a stickler for safety
My lady, can you direct me to a blacksmith shop so that I can use the mens room?
You know you can just stop at the red lights, right?
I got doored two times too many
Do these make my butt look medieval?
Chivalry isn't dead, it's just out of shape.
It’s less aerodynamic than lycra, but at least it’s recycled!
Long sword? In a lake? Appeared to Arthur? Yes, that's mine. Can you hold it 'til 5?
Sure it's heavy, but I totaled a truck once and didn't get a scratch.
This is much better than the drawbridge.
Remind me to pick up the mail on our way back.
It was on sale on Prime Day.
It's really great at preventing road rash.
I misunderstood when you asked if I would go on a night ride
I've been feeling a little rusty lately
I must say...I’m a little rusty.
I heard all the Lance jokes years ago, okay?
Think about it. A soda can seals in all the liquid. Ergo I can’t dehydrate.
You need more than just a helmet to ride safely in this city.
Cycling is great when your middle aged.
Well you said we were going through Central Park, didn't you.
Long story short, I went through a portal.
I know it's heavy, but my shrink said be your own knight in shining armor.
This is just until we get Universal Healthcare.
Right,but you gotta understand,things have changed. When I imagined this moment,you were wearing white and on a horse.
Isn't just a helmet enough?
Actually, I said we should bike *at* night.
It's aluminum and lightweight, for speed and efficiency.
Can I squeak by you?
OK, so we’ll be passing a driving range.  I still say you’re overreacting.
My dragon’s in the shop.
Personally, I’d save the armour for off-road...
Oy! I'm going to have the worst helmet hair!
First, it was the bike helmet.  Then it was the kneepads...
No, it's pedal to the metal....not metal to the pedal!
Mail delivery.
I plan on falling.
Well, you said you only went out for knight rides.
Somebody’s gotta tell you... UnderArmour is a clothing brand cyclists wear.
I just got hired as a courier in NYC!
My mom told me she would be at mile 10 to make sure I was wearing my armor.
My fair Maiden, I beg your pardon as I blow past thee.
RAN OUT  OF SUNSCREEN
I wear Under Armour on the inside.
She's about to pass-is chivalry still an option?
I'm not a big fan of bugs hitting me in the face.
Slings and arrows whether by mad dogs, road rage or Twitter, shall harm me not!
I think you misunderstood what an Ironman Triathalon is!
I'm training for the Tour de 12th Century France.
You should try Under Armour it breathes better.
Taking up cycling now that you’re retired from the Game of  Thrones “
I can’t afford my health insurance.
Why yes, Ma'am. I'm a Connecticut Yankee.
No road rash for you, eh?
If a helmet is supposed to work, why stop there?
Downhill grades mess with my knight vision.
Well, if they get rid of Obamacare, I'm protected!
Jousting was too hard on my knees.
On your right, Sir Knight.
Honey, I guarantee you'll look just as manly at the Renaissance fair in spandex.
Advice? Sure...careful with the brakes when you're followed by a guy with a lance
I'm embracing my middle-agedness.
New suit?
I'd assumed this is what you wore over Under Armour.
I still live with my parents.
Knight on a bike, how can I help you?
Remember Lance?
Your first Iron Man race? May be your last.
I think you misunderstood when I said "let's go for a night ride, it will be a lot cooler".
I guess I misunderstood when you asked if I wanted to go for a knight ride.
Look, dragon's breath is already bad for the ozone. I'm doing my part.
It's only a problem when it rains.
One close call with an Uber and you will too....
Yes, it's the Ironman Triathlon, but not literally.
I was tired of lifting weights.
Yeah, Over Armour is definitely worse.
It's Lancelot. I gotta take this.
I promise, next week we’ll ride our steeds and you can carry the lance.
My other ride is getting shoed"..
The difference is like Knight and day
See a not-so-trusty steed gallop by milady?
Yes, I'm wearing it, but, Dad, other kids don't have to wear a suit of armor when they get their training wheels off.
Last leg!  Metal to the pedal!
Good day and good knight.
Joan?  Joan Arc?  Is that you?
A helmet is just not enough!
No, I am not 'the king of bicycling.' But I am His Majesty's faithful envoy.
Where's your lance, Armstrong?
Of course you don’t get it, mom! It’s social commentary on today’s  culture of dominance and deception
Do look like I’m ok?
It's a better glute workout than jousting.
I know, I know. But it was free with the helmet purchase.
My father was the Tin Man.
it's an uphill battle
People in my neighborhood really don’t like when you bike on the sidewalk.
Apparently ‘Italian steel’ wasn't specific enough.
Smart Outfit!......... how do you pee in that thing?
To me, it's all the same: the peddle to the metal and the metal to the peddle.
I'm accident prone, that's why.
Give me a break. Last week you made fun of me for wearing spandex!
Dressing as Jeanne d'Arc is still not going to get a woman in the Tour de France.
Can we stop to oil my codpiece?
I'm late for the Festival.  Supposed to fight a dragon holding flowers for a damsel.  What a cliche.
Pedal faster! There are still Trumps, in NYC!!!
The taxis won't see it coming.
Howdy, would you like to join me in the war against cars?
Sally, I said Under Armor, not Over Armor
I'm just saying... in a risk-reward comparison, it doesn't seem worth it.
Regular sunblock doesn’t work anymore.
That’s from Over Armor, right?
I think I ordered from wrong"under armor" website...
Nothing huzzahs quite like a vintage power suit.
Hope it doesn't rain.
I’m just saying it may be possible to take bike safety too far.
I’m moving away from spandex, too.
Today is night-ride; knight-ride is next week
At least I get to attack downhill this time.
I figured, well, if UNDER Armour is good, then...
I don’t want to talk about what happened to the horse.
It's Over Armour
We broke up but he said I was a knight to remember.
Apparently I took the term "Ironman" too literally.
You'll wish you had one too once we fall off the end of this illustration.
Sorry, I thought you said "viking"
When you said you were going to add something from the past, I imagined it would be something like a clothes pin with playing card.
I hear those new carbon fiber outfits are only good for one crash.
If you must know, I'm escaping from that cartoon contest of two weeks ago!
Hey, about coming over to my place for a knightcap?
It was either this or training wheels.
When you go up against an SUV, you need armor!
You’re talking on your phone, you are going the wrong way on a one way street, and you just went thru a red light...you do need body armor.
My bike company merged with Nike...its called  
"Knike "
It's a new line of bike wear called Outer Armour.
If you could do that well in the swim, the run should be a piece of cake!
I don't get road rash. I get road sparks."
Thanks for not bringing the lance.
Pardon me. I've got places to be, centuries to catch up on.
...so that's when I realized that I have to be my own knight in shining armor.
The joust did not go well, but fortunately I keep a back-up ride.
My trusty steed went to The Crusades with my best friend.
I said let’s bike at NIGHT, Greg...
Yes, I'm coming to the wedding. And yes, I am wearing my suit.
Get out your oil can. It is going to rain.
...and so will my horse be ready by Friday?
M'lady, please removeth thy earbuds.
Bill, I said it was a night bikeride!
Tell him to blanch the Kale first, then in ice water. Are we in the bus lane?
You know what? I want a divorce.
It's loud, but surprisingly breathable.
It's in case I win the race, and have to meet Trump.
Tonight’s the knight!
I burn calories just putting this on.
Passing on the left me lady.
They had it in neon yellow too.
Yeah, but a bike doesn't poop.
I love our knight rides together.
If you think your chain is rusty wait till it rains!
I can be there in 5 minutes and yes my armor is shining.
I thought you asked to go on a knight ride.
I'm tired of being body-shamed.
They told me the plume was aerodynamic...
Hey, wanna see my under armour?
Ironman training?
I’m more of a Knight-Rider
You also laughed when I grew a handle-bar mustache but then it came back into style.
I'm trying this new athletic gear called "Over Armor"
I'm dreading the swimming part of this race.
Get real, it's  time   to  get off your  high  horse.
It's hard admitting that you're a woman and voted for Trump.
I feel like I've put on a little weight.
Not what I had in mind when you asked me to go on a night ride.
Why do people keep asking me if I am the Knight Rider?!
I thought spandex was a little too showy
Does it sound like my chain is squeaking again?
It is a little tougher on the up-hills.
The best thing about having an exoskeleton is that you don't have to wear all that lycra
I love taking Knight rides after work!
Besides being lighter weight, spandex is more breathable.
You know what—I’m just glad to finally see a white knight going the distance
I'm drop dead gorgeous and I want to stay this way."
Sir Lancelot Armstrong
You’ll see. This will come in handy if we have to attack a castle.
What? the casting call said to wear a suit for amour?
Brakes just slow me down.”
I'm training for the Iron Man competition.
This heavy bottle of water is slowing me down.
Yes, 9-1-1 !  I'm in pursuit of a clown on a unicycle who stole my jousting lance!
Oh, nothing special, just girl knights out.... What are you doing?
Have you seen the price of oats?
My new bike only weighs 22 lbs., but I'm not noticing any difference.
They don't see me any better, but the marks I leave now are way beyond paintless dent repairs.
The law does not state the type of helmet.
I ride for the Knights of the Round Table.  Who is thy patron?"
Time machine a success, now bring me back.   Entire future controlled by 2”x5” shiny black card.
I've got an app for the horse and the lance.
I gave up the horse and the sword, but the armor just makes sense these days.
how far is this place "Camelot" ?
Let me guess... classics major?
Yeh, I’m starting a new trend: Over Armor
In my previous life this wouldn't have been so exhausting.  My horse did all the work!
Legend has it, there's a fish out there somewhere who needs a bicycle.
Nobility is out of style. Today’s knights are more focused on mobility.
I met a man named Otto who didn't know what a palindrome is.
After the doping scandal I became Lancelot.
I said do you want to go for a night ride Jason,  not a knight ride.
My horse is ready.
I meant night ride
You need to pee?
That’s not what they mean by iron man competition
Spandex has its merits, but you can't beat this for security.
It’s casual Friday.
Do you hear whistling, too?
Running a little late. 650, 700 years tops.
Why?  My therapist said that knight bicycle rides are very therapeutic.
It's so much harder now horses aren't allowed into the city.
how do you pee?"
You're the one who wanted to move here to Portland.
Did I leave my lance at your place?
The bike and the injury avoidance uniform together was cheaper than a new car.
I just thought you meant a night ride.
You’ll need a strong lance arm!
My cowboy outfit is at the cleaners.
Not what I meant by 'night cycling gear', but at least it's reflective.
You said let’s take a knight ride together!
It's knockoff Under Armour
Why the bike, Sire?  I’m trying to reduce my horse manure footprint.
My mother doesn't believe in half measures.
Got mail?
Let me call you back after I slay this hill.
I told you to stop screwing around with the time machine!
I like a classic look. But I don't know if I can pull this off."
Electric scooters and driverless Ubers, Segways and distracted pedestrians.  You can't be too protected.
Even with bike lanes, you can't be too careful.
Yes,it is 100 per cent recyclable!
It turns out dragons leave huge carbon footprints
I started wearing this after the NYPD decided to crash police cars into cyclists.
Apparently, I need a permit for my lance, too.
Sharon. It's me, Colin. Quickly, I haven't any time to explain.
These new bicycle safety laws are archaic.
Just taking the necessary precautions; my health plan has a high deductible.
Remember, quest is just part of questionable.
People call me Lance a lot.
What a great knight for a ride.
Aren't you a night rider?
So I'm afraid of the traffic. So sue me.
My wife insists I use protection.
It’s not just safer, the extra weight boosts my cardio.
`Furanku gērī no saikuringū~ea no rain wa, anata ga kite iru nodesu ka?'
("Is that the Frank Gehry line of cycling wear I heard about, you're wearing?")
See you at the moat.
When your doctor said if you were going to exercise you'd need more iron he meant in your diet, silly.
I’m training for a crusade.
What? My horse is in the shop for a tuneup.
The potholes put a chink in my armor.
Ever since I lost the saddle of my bike, I figured I probably shouldn't be riding around unprotected.
I ran out of sunblock.
This isn't what I meant when I said "let's go night riding" .
Oh, it’s moisture wicking alright!
Didn't you say we were going for a knight ride?
I'm from King Arthur's court. Which way to Connecticut?
Once more unto the breach!
Ohhh...NIGHT Riding. That does makes more sense
Mom, I'm thirty years old"
"You put your helmet back on right now young lady!"
Ohhh ... I heard KNIGHT ride.
I'm on knight duty.
I'm a modern day Crusader.
I am the NIGHT errant!
"The triathlon swimming is a bitch.
Of course, I still haven't met my deductible.
Peloton just wasn't doing it for me anymore
Our Knightly rides are getting a little intense don't you think?
I should have been more specific when I told the clerk I wanted high-viz gear for night riding.
My horse got turned into a bicycle.
Don’t ever hum “The Impossible Dream” when you’re shopping for bike accessories.
Darlene, a sunblock with SPF 50+ would work just as well.
I think you dropped your lance a ways back.
Look, the rest of the guys have steroids.
I live in a tough neighborhood.
I thought you said you wear armor when you go cycling....not Under Armour!
A helmet isn't enough in mid-town.
Were you riding in yesterday’s hailstorm?
Just watch me going downhill
Hello, Knight on a bike, what's your emergency?
Pardon me my lady... do you know where I can find a noble steed?
I'm out for my knightly ride.
You can’t be too careful.
The roads are fine. It's when I get into the office that I'm concerned.
You are taking "Under Arnour" too literally.
Never ask Siri to invite your friends to a Night Ride.
A Hard Day’s Knight
My steed is in the shop.
These seats are so uncomfortable.
Good Knight!
Even at the Renaissance Festival you bike to work?
Yes, a strong helmet and a reflective outfit
...and I'm also a vegan.
I like this route: No cars and trucks, no cell phone users to watch out for, and lightly sketched in scenery that doesn't distract us.
I'm a messenger in the business district. These are my work clothes.
So Carol, you just meant N-I-G-H-T ride?
You never know when or where your knight in shining armor will turn up.
Metro-medieval. What are you?
It was supposed to be a  N-I-G-H-T bike ride
Let’s just make it past the Renaissance festival, okay?”
I just love putting the metal to the pedal...
I think I was WAY TOO LITERAL on this whole Iron Man concept
Sorry...my horse is in the shop.
The only problem is the helmet interferes with my phone receptions in the city.
All that just so you can yell "metal to the pedal!"?
Uphill's a bitch.
I couln't afford an armored car
The chafing’s killing me, but it keeps the wind off.
The carbon fibers actually make it much lighter.
When I asked you to move up and break wind for me that is not exactly what I had in mind.
The a.c., heating , and backup camera are included in the basic price of the suit. The dealer threw in the wrap-around airbags when I upgraded the sound system
I'm putting my metal to the pedal.
His career in ruins, Lance Armstrong encountered major problems with his Lancelot rebranding efforts.
I feel pretty stupid in these pants, too.
The manual said to use Armor All on my bike.
”Nay, ‘tis the metal to pedal.
Last one to the festival is a consort.
I thought you said you’re bringing your tan steed, not 
your ten-speed.
I meant "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"
Yes my liege, I’m wearing my helmet.
I think something on my bike is rattling.
Can't wait 'til I'm over eighteen and will need only the helmet."
I thought it was called Tour de Force, not Tour de France.
Oh, crap!  You mean it's supposed to be under armor?
That's Sir Lance Armstrong to you!
I was into armor before it was under.
Swimming is the most difficult for me.
The King blames gentrification but I kind of like it.”
I'm the Knight Rider.
It's a ten-STEED bike, actually.
Well, this is an improvement. In my last job, I was Goofy at Disneyland.
Yes I fight crime but now I also help protect the environment as the Knight Rider.
No, I'm the other Lance.
I'm about to get Medieval on you.
My commute's from the mid 70s to the low 1200s.
I don't like how I look in bike shorts.
No, not heavy at all.  These new ones are titanium.
It‘s like the ice-bucket-challenge. Just the Tour-de-France in an armor.
My boyfriend doesn't take no for an answer "
Actually, it's kevlar.
Sure my horse is faster. But this gets me to my optimal heart rate in no time.
And you were worried about looking silly with the training wheels.
I'm going to Washington, D.C.
This was all that was left after Amazon Prime  Days
I just saw the scarecrow & cowardly lion...they think you just passed the turnoff for Emerald city
Yeah, no dad's a bigger bicycle-safety drag than mine.
I've got to put the metal to the pedal... I'm late for my first day at Medieval Times!
The dogs around here are nasty.
Excalibur.......what are you searching for?
Electric Scooter advisory at 86th Street
Is it your chain or you, that's squeaking?
Heading in to the city?
My mother is still choosing my clothes.
It's a very old bike.
I have a feeling I'm not in Camelot anymore.
The third part of the triathlon is jousting.
My usual ride has much more horsepower.
Joust training isn't what it used to be.
does the bike line continue over the moat?
KITT? It's Knight Rider.
...from Amazon, of course.
What!? Bring my horse out o
in this traffic?
Just passing through on a Quest!
I'm regretting that third bran muffin.
Oh, the suit ? Well, Brinks is trying to copy Uber Eats .
If we die here today, just imagine how confused the archaeologists that find us a thousand years from now will be."
"It's just a bike ride, Jim, you will not die here today.
My mother always told me, "Safety first!"
After I bought the helmet and gloves I couldn’t stop.
joust to be safe
I'm working the knight shift.
I'm training for the Ironwoman, and you?
And when I drive my car,
 I hate people riding bicycles.
Gwen had a flat tire, Arthur.
It did say "Ironman" . . . .
I didn't think that Vision Zero meant nobody could see us!
Oh yeah, that's all I hear, "Where's Lance?"
We need to go back, I forgot my spear.
It’s like I’m riding a horse with no mane.
Yes, I get "where's you lance, Lance" often
Lycra for comfort, steel for safety.
The princesses rescued themselves. I work for Uber Eat now.
Please, no "Knight Rider" jokes.
That’s not what I meant when I suggested a night ride.
With traffic the way it, a is a helmet is not enough.
palladin
My trusty steed hates uphill climbs.
Am I creaking or is it the bike?
M'lady rides a fine steed, but her armor appeareth ineffective.
I guess biking seemed like the logical next step after my jousting days were over.
Super easy. I just lock it to one of the racks they have in the basement.
I'm taking a ride on Central Park West.
So much for the old trusty steed.
Sure it's hot but I never drop a call.
Valiant steed's day off.
I wiped out last week, I’m not taking any chances
The problem with renting my gear is that I never know how old it is.
Aren't you concerned about cell phone radiation?
San Francisco.  Why?
I'm not buying into the whole "self-driving" cars thing!
I must go back in time for dinner.
It’s SPF 999, I have sensitive skin.
As you can see, I'm on a Trek.
Don't you love that first smooth ride after oiling your chain mail?
This guy says hail was not predicted after all.
'It’s amazing how just dressing differently can affect your influence. Dress like a beggar and your assumed poverty gains you looks of contempt;...sport armor and you look strong, dutiful, and prepared."
-- A.J. Darkholme Rise of the Morningstar
I say traffic lights are just a suggestion.
My horse is sick.
There is a dragon with flowers at your door?  I'll be there as fast as I can but will still probably be at least a week late.
When I said the knight rider marathon was on all week, I meant on nbc.
I normally don't ride during the day.
I thought you would be slightly rusty...
It's not the wheel, it's my knee that needs the grease!
This is what I get for binge watching Game of Thrones
My bike is OK but I need an oil stop
Just  be sure to keep the metal on the pedal.
Well, somewhere along the line, my quest for fitness became my Quest For Fitness...
Yeah it's a hassle to bike in, but at least I don't have to change once I get to work
Is mercury in retrograde?
Sometimes, cardio is feudal.
I thought you were just a night rider.
I was told you were a bike exemplar, not a Templar.
It's okay until it rains.
It's an N-I-G-H-T ride, Larry.
If I had known it would be this humid, I would have worn shorts.
Usually I wear garters  but I said to myself, 'This might be a night of a different order.'
They call me Lancelot Armstrong.
I have my jousting class after work.
At the bike shop, they said this suit would be perfect for night riding.
We're headed back to the 16th century, so I thought I'd get ready.
I may be a little rusty, but I'm ahead of you!
I was going to ask you where Lance was but I guess you get that all the time.
Yes, it's comfortable, but it could breathe a little better.
Yeah, it’s the new thing, called extreme spinning.
I really didn’t think this through. I should’ve picked a helmet with better visibility.
You think she’s really looking for a ‘literal knight in shining armor’?
It makes me feel safer when I disregard stop signs and carelessly pass on the right.
Going for a late knight ride?
My horse is at the vet's.
My mom always told me when things get moving too fast, there isn't time to put on protection.
NIGHT biking.
The horse-share station was empty.
Your helmet is so cute - is it vintage?
I'm dressing for the times - medieval.
Mother insisted.
The tournaments were great until the nimbys made us stop using horses!
Protected sure. But it chafes at the joints Mom.
What? You're proposing? Now? Do you know what I'm doing and where I am? Of course I'll marry you.
Artie dear, how much longer 'til we get to Camelot?
It's little wonder that your tires are flat half the time!
I think I'll take some of that chain grease you offered after all.
It's the moisture-wicking Under Armor brand
But can your helmet do this?
I get it, people don't respect the bike lane. But isn't that a bit much?
Got any Grey Poupon?
What? Never heard of recycle and reuse?
Ok, I admit it.  I was wrong about what they meant by "Iron Man".
It is I, Sir Chaffesalot.
Of course then the dragon got an electric scooter so this was only logical
A bespoke Excalibur 360, me lady.
I thought you said bike knight.
Have you seen a stone with a sword in it? Or my horse?
This is the last time I buy a "Night Riding Suit" online.
Going incognito again?
Art? Lance here. I’ve found out what the simple folk do.
Damn it, I think I left the cauldron boiling.
Will you marry me now? After all,you can't resist a knight in shining armor.
Madam: “Good Knight”
I liketh to keepe up with the tymes.
You're being a little over-protective.
The fourth event of the quadrathalon is jousting.
Yes, hello, emergency room? I am checking wait times just in case.
Rule #1.  Never drink water BEFORE I ride.
My chain and my knees could use some oil.
Joust out for a ride.
You know, if you switched to a hands-free earpiece, it would free you carry a lance.
Tour de Lance ...a-lot
Pot holes, mam, pot holes.
I said riding at night could be fun, not riding as a knight.
I need more protection from distracted drivers.
Yep, PETA kept complaining that jousts put the horses in danger
Kickstarter is paying for it.
I call it Renaissance chic.
Enough already about the helmet.
Rust much?
I'm training for next year's Joan of Arc.
But no one else is wearing one, Mom.
This year's introduction of retro jerseys has really slowed the Tour de France.
My horse's emissions are hurting the environment
Some of the drivers have lances.
It’s the Tour de France and I’m Joan of Arc.
Yonder left!
I prefer to put the metal to the peddle.
It’s my new Over Armour Urban Cycling suit....
Someday I'll have to get this visor fixed so it stays up.
I said, “Let’s take a NIGHT ride.”
I'm saving a ton on feed.
I hope to hell it doesn't rain.
Didn’t you say I should wear my under armor?
Overkill? No, my health insurance company issued it.
Only when I have to sneeze.
You would if you had been hit as many times as I have!
I see you're taking the Brooklyn Bridge today.
I hope it rains and you rust completely, you coward.
This is my knight-time bicycle protection.
It's a Middle-Aged choice.
You mean you only wanted a night on a bike?
I hate the helmet rule.
Doc, she says she never wanted a knight in shining armor--just some  nights of dazzling ardor.
I’m road testing the back story for the new series of Knight Rider
“I plan on giving Trump the middle finger.”
This is quite necessary. Since deregulation, archers on the High Line like to hunt bikers for sport.
Next Ironman competition, I’m wearing Under Armour.
This helmet visor is a real nuisance for my cellphone.
The job is quickly evolving, we now sit around a square table.
It's part of the training program for my first Ironman.
What do you mean, the Tour de France doesn't go through Orleans?
I have a terrible horse allergy.
This is the only way my insurance company let’s me ride.
Laura I told you to wear under armor
That's not what I meant when I recommended "Under Armour".
I can’t afford to let my followers see me riding a off-brand bike.
The only problem is if it gets damaged in a crash I have to replace the whole outfit.
Can’t chat now; my boss hates late knights.
You're the Knight Rider!
Yes Karen chafing is a major problem.
Next time, try leaving something to the imagination.
With all that texting and driving I need the armour.
It's the only way I can keep my mom off my back.
...because the Mayor said we should wear reflective clothing.
Thou ridest the same model steed as I"
Because my cycling clothes are in the wash and I ran out of sunscreen.
Are you here to slay the Central Park dragon?
Everyone already knows you're paleo.
Is it the bike or you that needs oiling?
The extra weight helps me build momentum.
I’m pretty sure “dark night of the soul” is a metaphor...
Nice helmet, m'lady.
Got it at Bill's Bikes and Jousting.
It came down to jousting or riding my steed to work, and the bike's easier to park.
Wanna get oiled?
You need a horse for the jousting competition?
My wife felt nervous about my biking in the city
It's the new Under Armour cycling wear.
No! I'm serious. How do I turn on the damn GPS!
I’m hoping this qualifies me for the Ironman.
This is not what I meant when I suggested we go for a night bike ride.
You are taking this under armor sponsorship a bit too far.
I feel more vulnerable than ever.
I like to put the pedal to the metal.
Hey, if I wanna refer to my bike as my steed, that’s my business!
Didn't we agree that after we broke away from the peleton,you'd ride in my slipstream for the first 10 kilometers?
It's New York!  I'd rather be safe than squashed.
I'm great on the downhills, a little rusty on the climbs.
She got it in the divorce.
It's all downhill from here.
Wait a sec: I'm  ordering something from Amazon.
I updated the bike but the rest of my gear is medieval.
Yes, I got my new outfit from Under Armor.
They didn't have bubblewrap in my size.
Unhinged kneeplate. There's a great welding shop about three miles from here.
This makes cycling really hard.
My steed is ready?  Joust in time.
I shall vanquish all scooters.
I thought a helmet was a good idea, too, then I saw the algorithms.
Really? You took the call?
Where do you keep the messages you deliver?
I think you wanted UNDER armor.
My bike lock is made out of a chastity belt.
Jiffy -Lube 
Near Me
Yes I work at the Renaissance Fair, but I use the Prince street bike lane also.
It protects me against bandits, hill trolls, and SUVs.
They really cheaped out on this Knight Rider remake.
A little rusty?
So she's French, right, and what I''m hearing her say is 'Armor, armor'....
Sure it's hot, but when you're a Knight of the Roundabout, you commit.
Person: First time on a bike?
Knight: I gave up my horse for the modern-urban lifestyle.
It's carbon fiber...I shaved 3 stones!
Urban jousting separates the middle and upper class.
Crap! Where's my phone?
I'm just finally accepting your attitude that I exhibit medieval behavior.
I get a discount on my accident insurance wearing this outfit."
Hey, Hasselhoff...I've got a great spin for the "Knight Rider" reboot.
I just got a call back for an Under Armor ad
You ever see any dragons on this route? I really hate dragons.
My front wheel tends to come off unexpectedly.
I'm training for an armored-man triathlon.
we ran out of condoms
I was "randomly selected" and they took my sword.
I thought you said this was a knight-biking club.
I'm protesting the absence of bike lanes.
You’re listening to the All Medieval station again, aren’t you?
Let's just say my drawbridge didn't open in time.
My ex always participates in this race, I thought it's best to be well prepared.
My horse is at the farrier.
It's recycled.
I'm trying to reduce my carbon hoofprint.
Are you chivalrous or training for an Ironman?
We have to share the bike lane with the jousting team.
At least my pants leg doesn't get caught in the chain.
I came prepared for an uphill battle.
This under armor gives me extra road rash protection, but its also giving me a rash... it's a vicious cycle."
Wow, it doesn't look a bit like spandex.
You're going to need more than a helmet if you're going to ride into the city.
Ironman? I thought they said Iron Throne.
I told my touchy, feely boss this was to protect me while cycling but it’s really to protect me from him.
You're lucky the armor isn't blinding you!
Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle!
What can I say? My trusty steed is at the vet.
The coop board REALLY banned the horse?
Everything is fine except I need some  WD- 40.
Oh, you meant Armor All the bike!
I’m looking for Connecticut
Oh, you're still riding steel?! You've got to go carbon.
The store was out of Under Armour
This is such a wobbly horse.
Think parking a car is bad? Imagine a horse.
Alexa!  Fix dinner and clean the living room!
Pull over for an oil change to stop the squeaking.
They don't always give you three feet.
But where do you keep your cell phone?
You sure this is the way to the next tournament?
Is the party theme sexy knights or sexy nighties?
I suppose little plastic hats are O.K. for the head, but I'm serious about all of me.
Leave me alone! The check is in the mail...
I ran out of suntan lotion.
I think I misunderstood when you said lets go "Knight Riding".
I'm afraid this race is really testing my mettle.
When will my horse be ready?
Prithee, sir knight, hast thou not heard of carbon fiber?”
Siri says, "Get a horse" or "Go across". The reception is lousy up here.
Okay, I'll save it for the bedroom.
It's the seven pounds in seven miles diet
I lost my single-steed.
Stop being over dramatic.
Relax, it's just like riding a horse.
Only because the biggest cities have the biggest potholes.
I left my mace at home.
Some people bike during the day - I personally like knight rides.
Wear whatever you'd like, but keep the squeaking down, please!
Guinevere is adjusting beautifully , thanks for asking
I couldn't find my sunglasses.  That's why.
It’s not just bulletproof; my radar signature is nil!
Did you close the living room window?
No...no...no.  I said the fight for fitness was a futile struggle.
I thought you said this was a knight ride.
If you have any other questions, you can reach me at the "Knights of  the Open Road" Bicycle Club in Hoboken.
They told me the knight rentals were cheaper.
The main advantage is that my chaffing problem is sorted.
The upside is that I can use the same oil I put on my chain to keep the visor from rusting.
Harry, you're weird. First texts from "Camelot." Now this.
Spandex is in the laundry.
Errand, not errant.
Now I'm kicking myself that I didn't spring for the optional lance-holder.
It doesn't chafe as much as you'd think
The armor is the negotiable for a lower deductible.
Now that it's all downhill, I bet you're the one who feels silly.
Excuse me, but what's the exit for Camelot?
They call it 'Schwinning Armor.'
Ya it's warm, but it's recycled and it won't wear out.
My jousting horse isn't allowed on this road.
You should see my steed! Less than a thousand miles on her...
How's the free-lancing going?
This is more hypoallergenic that latex.
Turns out there wasn't an available trusty steed in the Tri-state area.
None shall pass.
...And I thought I was being safe
I keep falling over when I can't clip out at a stop sign.
Have you seen an armored horse with an empty saddle go by recently?
First she said the biker shorts weren't masculine enough...
You can never be too safe.
This is for jousting with the CitiBike riders
My horse did nothing for my health!
It’s a millennial thing...
Its called the "Knight-Rider". Rated highest in safety!
My fashion sense may be a little out of date, but you can't beat the classics.
Oh, a night bike ride.  I get it.
Put that visor down. Don't you care about your safety?
Sir Lancelot Armstrong, and you?
You know, when I complained about chivalry being dead, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind.
So when they said the city had medieval infrastructure...
When you said you wanted to go on a night bike ride, this is not what I thought you meant
It's vintage.
My sponsor?  Under Armour!
I think I get the "errant" part now.
Outrageous fortune, yes; slings and arrows, no!
It gives me a little more protection from the taxicabs.
It's actually all carbon fiber
I think it will be knight soon.
“Yeah, cycling with armor is allowed, as long as there’s no Lance.”
This is the last time I put off laundry day.
I thought I had all the carbon fibre I needed...but now I also have a lance and shield on back order too.
I prefer to wear only pre-1800s materials when I work out.
The kid at the bike shop said I should be outfitted old school.
On second thought, let's not go to Camelot.
Maybe I should switch to Underarmor.
Hi, I'm Under Armor!
After what happened to Dave, I had to.
Good luck working up a sweat wearing that.
My wife won't let me bike near women without a chaperone or without wearing this.
He said he could only get away for a knight.
I meant night ride, not knights ride--my bad.
I've always been a big David Hasselhoff fan.
This way I don't need to worry about cars or stop signs.
Yeah, pretty good. Yourself?
It’s for a very specific type of Ironman competition.
Only since smartphones got popular.
My WD-40 for your water bottle. It's a win-win.
Steel is real, m'lady...
This Don Quixote line of bike wear feels ill conceived
I'm trying to combine my two passions: cycling and rashes.
What? Don't you know how we took over airports in 1775?
Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Sir Lancet Armstrong.
Don’t ever get a Horse Title Loan.”
Jousting practice was TODAY?!
I took a wrong turn at Agincourt.
Online dating was a bust - I'm trying a different kind of quest.
I left my jousting sword at home. Can you please ride ahead of me?
I guess it helps you downhill.
I am taking hot yoga on the road.
Rain today, rust tomorrow!
Hey! Your chain mail is slipping off.
I’m done with spandex.
I'll go first and clear the way.
I think I'm a little over dressed for this !
I’m working on letting my guard down a little.
This? It's nothing compared to the jousting pole that I used to carry.
This isn't Conneticuit?
I know it's slightly archaic, but you can't be too careful these days. Plus, it's more flattering than those spandex bike shorts.
'"It's been a while since I last rode. Im feeling  bit rusty"
Is the water bottle making my bike too heavy?
I believe the recommendation was for Under Armor
You've gone way beyond hipster.
Under Armor’s got nothing on me.
I'm headed for the Round Table. You?
Did you see the way they were staring?
I'm sorry, but Knight Rider drove a hot car. He didn't ride a plain bike.
We're calling it The New Dark Ages.
So, are you going to join your ye olde fantasy jousting league or what?
It even has pockets!
It's my urban mobile armor.
I read that suits are coming back.
I don’t feel any safer and my sports bra is turning on me.
THIS CARTOON MAKES NO SENSE
The bicycle shop said it's good for off road.
They call it Over Amour
But for all its advantages, I miss being one with my mount...
Trying to recycle some of my gear.
I think you misinterpreted night ride.
I'm training for an Ironman too.
See? Chivalry isn't dead.
I actually had something else in mind when I suggested Armor All on your bicycle seat.
Is that a Medieval fanny pack?
I would never just rely on a helmet.
Tell you what I don't miss; the pooper scooper.
Wearing bright colors never helped so I thought I'd try this.
Nah, I just got off the subway.
It's a lot harder to reach 88mph on a bike.
Check out Crusader Vintage.com
Yeah, but the tear gas can still get in.
This was such a great deal on Prime Day I couldn't resist!
Look ahead. You're the one who's gonna feel stupid when that truck hits us.
I finally had enough when she accused my mother of being overly protective.
THE ONE DAY I GO MEDIEVAL
I am on my way to the Tour de Force.
I agree, this new time travel app isn't working for me either.
Even Brink's has shifted to the gig economy.
Aren’t you over reacting Lance?  You just scraped your knee.
This suit is more aerodynamic than it looks.
I'm mainly a night rider.
It’s still lighter than a Citi Bike
Next thing you know these bikes will be electric
Who knew buying protection for your phone could be so extreme, especially this day in age...
What on earth are those ridiculous pants?
It was in my middle ages that I got into heavy metal.
White horses are hard to find.
My Kingdom for some Spanx.
New brakes were too expensive.
Feeling vulnerable today???
After my last accident, my wife threw down the gauntlet...literally...!
I have bad news about the city's new Bicycle Safety Action Plan...
Lancelot Armstrong, pleasure to meet you, Miss
No, ‘Lance Armstrong’ was the joke, but I forgot my lance, so, I guess I’m just a knight. Anyway, do you bike here often?
What happened to the white steed?
Sorry, I can't hear your advice through my visor.
Methinks this saddle doth sorely chap me arse.
You’re kidding me. There is already a Knight Rider?
It's the bike shop, they couldn't fix my brakes.
Can you hear me, now?
I bruise easily.
We do re-enactments of early 20th century medieval re-enactments
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
I said bring underarmour, not knight armor.
I gotta go. Yeah, another biker challenging me to a joust.
The bike shop suggested treating everything with armor-all.
I am not your Knight in tarnished armour!!
Are you all right Sir?
They told me to get off my high horse, this was the only other option around
I'm not slowing down for joggers.
The clubs I get into now? They're the stuff of legend.
Heavy metal fan ?
Hasselhoff was a better Knight Rider.
I thought you said you needed an armored vehicle to survive this commute?
It lowers my premiums.
I hate road rash.
Chivalry isn't dead, but it is on a steep decline.
...had to list my roundtable on Craigslist, too.
Knight Rider
I feel so metal.
Please, don't tell anyone at work!
It's from their new product line, since their "under" apparel went so well.
My kingdom for a horse, instead I got a two-wheeler!
Turns out it's not as easy as riding a bike.
K", it changes the tone of many decisions
This feels very safe but going to the bathroom
has its own problems.
You wouldn't happen to have a long, pointed pole?
Did they say tournament or Tour de France?
I can't help it, I had really overprotective​ parents.
What do you mean you smell gasoline?
I'm training for Tour de Lance.
I think it’s time to move to the suburbs
People in cars have their armor, I have mine.

In first gear, resistance is feudal
Our peloton felleth down.
You would never guess that it is spandex.
My horse is out sick today.
I'm preparing for the e-scooters.
I think that I made a wrong turn about 200 years ago.
I’m going back to the future; aren’t I ?
My spandex was at the cleaners.
I feel safer but I can't pedal uphill.
Not what I meant by 'chivalry,' Todd.
Wearing all this protective gear outta keep the insurance premiums low.
I thought it can help women recognize I am following the rules of chivalry instead of the current predatory norms.
I thought this would do it but the delivery guys have moved up to trebuchets.
I can ride day and knight!
Too much beer at last night's costume party, and a broken can-opener.

The New Yorker sure screwed up its app.
I told you to iron your uniform, not wear iron.

I had an e-bike, but almost killed myself
It’s my new fall outfit.
I am historically accurate. Check "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court".....oh, darn. The water bottle.

Yes honey; I'll stop by the cleaners and pick up your suit.
I was shopping for a new helmet online and I used the keywords ‘Arm,’ ‘Strong,’ and ‘Lance.’ I have no idea what went wrong.
My trusty steed only had two gears.
But what if it rains
Do You Know Where the Joust path is?
BTW, did you pack the WD-40?
Once more unto the bike path, dear friends, once more!
I think it would be more appropriate if you were on a horse.
Wrong place at the wrong time
Sure, sure, but on the downhill...!
Wait until you scrape YOUR knee
It hasn't been the same without Lance.
I don't advise a visor.
My white horse doesn't do cities.
I thought we were going for a knight ride?

‘Safety over style, noob.’
It's competition not war.
You think you're helmet will protect you
No, just late for my gig at Medieval Times.
It's the original sportswear.
Onst thou left, fair damsel.
And, it's a lot less upkeep than your horse!
I said I wanted something suitable for NIGHT riding.
Yeah, sometimes the "Ironic Outfit" angle takes a lot of commitment. I might switch to a Steampunk Tuba shtick.
You wouldn't believe how much I've saved on my insurance since I bought this suit.
I thought you said you wanted to try poly-armory
Listen when I lay it down.
Don't bother calling me.  I don't have my phone.
Nice outfit.  But wouldn't brakes make you even safer?
My horse is already on the festival grounds.
What? It's no dumber than your fanny pack.
The suit came with the bike.
I miss Rudy Giuliani too.

I need this in Manhattan.
I'm training for iron man
This way, if they cut me up, I put a dent in their chassis.
So that's why they call it a "knight ride"
I wanted my outfit to match my helmet.
I thought it was ridiculous, too, but the guy at the shop kept saying "Steel is Real", so... here we are.
Is the President back in town?
I can’t hear you because of the clanking!
Of course she is a better negotiator than I am. She trots from home 3 days a week, and here I am wearing last year's armor.

Will you be my girlfriend now?
Is your suit titanium or carbon fiber?
I really need to do a wash.
You must be from the Nanny State.
Did your blacksmith also make your bicycle?
I have never felt that a helmet is enough protection
Because parking at the joust is just too expensive.

It’s my first triathlon. But everyone kept saying I should do the Ironman.
It’s my Knight Rider kit.
It worked for Mick Jagger, didn't it?
We're almost there.  Then I can take off this insect repellent outfit.
It somewhat levels the playing field.
I'm just a knight on a bike asking a girl to love him.
I hope it rains.
Believe it or not, it was my lack of confidence that was really slowing me down
I love how romantic the city looks when I'm knight riding.

I didn't know they had a stricter helmet law here.
Safety first...
This bike wasn't built for a Lance.

My codpiece? Had to leave it. Way too heavy.
This outfit?  Have you seen the bike lanes in Manhattan?
Go get your own draft, my lady.
Well the under armor makes it quite comfortable.
My toga is at the cleaners.
I still prefer my aulde metal frame.
I'm late for stage rehearsal.

What exactly do you mean when you say you’re missing your lance a lot?
I need an ironclad  alibi for being late!
It’s throw-back day at the Tour de France
Night guys finish last.
The bugs aren't biting!
There! That's much safer than that darn MAGA hat.
My steed and I are having a domestic
“The environment. My horse only got nine leagues per pund.”
I just can’t keep the sweat out of my eyes.
I thought it was the Tour de Medieval France
no road rash for you.
It’s the LuLuLemon #metoo line.
What’s your nom de plume?
Knight Rider,” I presume
Après moi, le déluge.
I know it's a bit extreme, but my first bike helmet was a shower cap.
I wasn’t joking when I said armor up we’re going downhill
I thought the event was a "knight ride"
Actually it looked perfect online but for the photo they’d held up the visor with blu-tack.
You're too young to remember Knight Rider
I misread the IronMan Triathlon rules. The swim was even worse!
Yes, iron supplements.
Huh, no horses in the city?
Oh, yes, I go cycling Knight and Day!
He doesn't use a condom.
This actually isn't any safer I am just training for the jousting tournament
I got tired of under armour
When they banned plastic bags, picking up poop was no longer an option.
City Steeds we’re all checked out...
That helmet makes you invisible.
Hey, didn't Trump say "Good Knight Tweet Sprints"?
The rental place was all out of armored cars.
So how long will your horse be in the shop?
Lucy, medieval warfare is great cardio"
This isn’t the European bike safety measure I had in mind.
I should have oiled myself before riding.
I always liked Lance a lot.
911? I'm being body-shamed by a non-gamer.
This next gen biking outfit protects against road rash
Beach body? No, I'm working on my Breach body.
Can't tell if it's the steroids or hemorrhoids, but something's changed!
It's just not a good century for you. You're more 17th.
The clanking eliminates the need for a bell.
Your last crash wasn't that bad.
Don't worry I've got this, I'm covered"
Hey, don't talk to me about ridiculous outfits.
Everything
Are you sure that this training will garner you a "Knight in Shining Armor?"
Collided once with a group called “running with the bulls”. Not pretty. Ain’t happening again!
Is it me, or do you too get annoyed each time Bill DiBlasio goes to Iowa?
Have you seen the movie Knight Rider?
I lost my horse in a joust!
They take safety and recycling seriously down at daddy's scrapyard.
Talk about a race to the bottom.
I must get this visor fixed - I thought it was knight time again
To a jousting tournament. Why do you ask?
This wasn't what I had in mind when they asked if I was ready to "ride into battle!"
I said ‘Night school’ you ninny.
Can't talk right now - I'm on a crusade to bang my new girlfriend!
I think the salesman meant Armorall clothing.
Look, I know I’ve got a gear loose.
Heavy fog on approach, Laguardia. Transition to IFR now.
If you don't look where you're going, you will be one big pile of scrap metal.
It's just a precaution. The lance corporal I broke up with didn't take it well.
Heard there were some pretty rough knights at this town.'
Oh, he's in contest #668? Thank goodness, I've been looking all over for him.
My criteria for eco-friendly bike gear: second hand and no plastics!
In my time your helmet would considered extremely dorky.
I told you, a tin hat would be enough . . .
It's 14th century CE somewhere.
Cars.
No, I actually I didn't have time to get my brakes fixed. Why do you ask?
The black was more slimming, but this heat is killing me.
I know Ira, but I fell in love with the helmet!
Yeah, it's weird, but it's the only way Mom will let me ride through city traffic.
Excuse me, you just missed the off-ramp to the castle.
With my knight visor helmet and metal to the pedal I could go for hours.
I can't believe some riders feel safe with only a helmet.
I've outgrown just knee pads.
You said be ready to attack the course
Artist’s impression of the Battle of Tours (de France)
My high-vis outfit wasn’t doing the trick.
Hello, Lost Dragon Hotline.
This is a lot easier without my lance
The ride was just OK. I'm a little rusty.
I misread the flyer when it said 10K Night Bike Race
The tour company said to dress for a night ride.
Back in the day, you only wore chainmail.
I thought you said...”Meet me at 8:00 pm for a little night ride”
What has happened to this horse?
I act like I own the road so why not dress like it also.
Below 52st it's helmet plus armor only.
The city is giving out full sets of plate mail to cyclists this weekend. See, the idea is that trucks drivers recall the medieval institution of knighthood chivalry and are thereby inspired to consider not running me over.
When your crush is more interested in the city he has lived in for years than on your date.
I’ve given up multitasking.
I clearly said trusty dun steed, not rusty one speed.
i Just love a good Knight ride
A lighter bike would solve everything.
I'm getting ready for the Ironman Triathlon.
I said let’s go for a “night ride.”
Well, what it lacks in fashion it makes up for as a bug-screen!
If you really want to be my knight in shining armor, you’ll call Uber next time !
I told you they said to wear Under Armour when exercising, but you never listen to me.
All the City Steeds were being used...
The other day, I read a book on effectively protecting ourselves from pollution, the aftermath of a nuclear war and best of all, politicians.
I know, I know. I should've encrypted those damn diplomatic messages.
I feel that you and I are living in a different era.
Was that with a kn or an n?
On these streets, I never thought wearing just a helmet was enough protection
They said if I don't pass it on I'll have bad luck for seven years.
No Mom,  I’ve taken every precaution. I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize my health
You just squeaked by!
Got this from Under Armour but visor design needs work.
I was told that Armor All  makes the wheels go faster
I love David Hasselhoff but I can't afford a car.
This will keep me from being sexually assaulted.
I don't get this. I'm the rider, but also the horse.
- Morning ma'am.
I told them "my kingdom for a horse" but my fitbit intervened.
The higher-SPF creams give me a rash.
My other bike is a charger stallion.
Crap!!!   Just realized I left my jousting stick at home!
I grew up watching Knight Rider.
Have any motorists caused you distress?
No, I’m afraid you’ve reached a different Knight Rider.
Well, you remember what happened to Bono!
Cycling's my THIRD love. Second? Jousting.Of course, my first love is the stage. Why do you ask?
I’m not sure about this trusty six-speed.
I'm training for the tour de Camelot.
I doubt DeBlasio will go for jousting in the bike lanes.  But he might like it for his press conferences.
Where's my lance? I knew I'd forgotten something.
Oh no, I have a slipped chainmail again!
"Didn't they say it was an '"Ironman" triathlon?"
The armor was a gift from my mother.
Pardon me, I'm a little rusty with a bike.
I thought this was supposed to be a summer night spin...
Hello SPCA. Please post: Lost or Stolen. My Trusty Steed. Bountiful Reward!"
Gaye Fontoura,  Ossining, NY
This is not what i meant by night riding.
Yes, but it’s great going downhill.
And then they said - you don’t take a horse to a joust fight.”
I'm embracing aerodynamics!
Tom, I said wear something from UNDER ARMOUR!
Hey, nice knightcycle!
Praytell, Ma'am - Which way to San Diego Comic Con?
It was on sale
I'm trying to make the whole duel experience more green and animal friendly.
Yes, me lady, I’m on my way to the store right now
When I said it was bike night, that is not what I meant!
Thanks...It was a real "steel" at that  vintage shop downtown.
I don't think that kind of 'chain mail' is going to help!
I'm a mail order bride.
I can’t believe you don’t get it. I’m Sir ‘Lance-alot.
Very retro.  Is it wicking?
What do you mean what am I wearing?
I’ll bet it helps with chafing let alone an errant sword attack
Last weekend, it was the World Naked Bike Ride.
It isn’t everyday you get to meet a ride in shining armour.”
Yes, Laura, I do get hot, but it is the only way I can get reception on this deserted road.
...new in town?
It's a rider to my policy
That's not what I meant when I said you should start rocking Under Armour.
Gosh, the smog seems really bad tonight.
What happened to your horse and pigeon?
Yeah, sure it's heavy but it got a 5 star safety rating.
I got the homophone wrong when they said it would be a Summer Night ride.
You can't let allergies run your life.
Quit taking your half out of the medieval.
My other body parts need protection too
I see how the k typo in knight race might have been misleading.
Did a big bay gelding just pass you?
You know, we could have taken the rail trail.
Did you take the reflective tape off my assiette du buttocks again?
I know our roads need work, but really?
I should have bought the Tony Stark bike gear....
My misunderstanding, but honestly, Susan, who goes for a 'night ride' through the park?!
Isn't body armor chic the market we're chasing?
For my own safety, I decided to enter the Bronx Age.
Hello, Mom? She said 'gantlet,' but I went with 'gauntlet.' And now she's called the whole thing off!
I don't know either. Last thing I remember is a lance to the head...
They replaced my stables with a Citibike rack
You lance?!
Yes, I need the $5,000 50-pound safety apparel—and yes I need the $15,000 ten-pound bicycle.
Hey, it beats flossing my bridge work after every bike ride.
On thy lift!
You're my Knight in Shining Armor??
Figures!
Can’t wait for the swimming portion.
Say what you want, but this is a lot faster than a carriage horse.
In a hurry, I forgot I’m working the knight shift
My dad, the insurance actuary, demands it. lucky me.
I was told it was all downhill from the Middle Ages
What can I say? It was a good marked down price at the thrift store after Halloween!
My horse went on strike until I lose a few.
Yeah Yeah. I am late for the work!
It protects against brain tumors.
It's a metaphor. I did it for you.
Thou too?
Ya great protection, but sunny days suck.
Where are your lights?
I guess I misread the flyer for this Under Armour fun ride.
Obviously you just moved here!
That's the thing with upselling.
Yeah, but it’s the jousting that’s the hardest part.
Yes, jousting is a bit more difficult.
Prithee, hast thou seen a green bike?
You bring new meaning to being passed.
I'm training for the 'Tour de Gaul.'
It's great for losing weight, but it's a lot of work keeping ahead of the rust inside.
Baywatch was ok but I think I do my best work as Night Rider.
Me horse's saddle feels worse on me 'bum than usual!
The Lady of the Lake was out of swords
I have a handicap. My rear tire is deflated and so am I.
Sorry, you’re looking for a different knight rider.
I've just been sponsored by Over Armour.
That rain shower was worse than I expected !  My  hand is stuck !
She didn't believe that I worked at Medieval Times--had to prove it somehow!
Ye,can't be to safe.
I foresee dented taxi bumpers and flats!
It’s the closest I could get to jousting.
How was I supposed to know her father was general manager at Medieval Times?
Mom, I've already found a use for my degree in medieval history.
I'm sorry, okay.  I'm still stuck on outmoded ideas of courtly love. I thought you might like it.
After you -- chivalry's not dead!
Team Exxon: Rejects climate change and aerodynamics but pays females equal.
But now, I'm way past the Paleo thing.
I'm ahead by a whole bike length
My lance is where?
She said she was looking forward to entering her middle ages.
It looks better than training wheels.
I hate these new machines you people call cars. In my days...
No, it’s ArmORstrong. But I get that a lot.
I figured lances, car doors; they're about the same hazzards.
Since motorists have gotten worse, I need all the protection I can get.
It's faster than riding horseback but the rest stops are hell.
I forgot my helmet!
Can't talk, Cathy. I'm late for a bike joust.
My trainer may have some out dated techniques, but now I have legs of steel.
...and so the kid goes, "Like, what chair, man"?
Not exactly what I expected when you said wanna go for a night ride??
It's bike to work day.
We can’t make it for dinner later…she says she wants a night in, shining armor.
Knight riding under the stars
I left my trusty steed in the 12th Century”
My horse is lame today.
Extra weight for the downhill is not fair!
I know it squeaks, but I maxed-out my Amazon account and couldn't order the visor lube.
This is what I call a nightmare ride!
But they said there is a three dollar an hour bump for the (k)night shift!
Facial recognition software drives me nuts.
I don't think this reboot of Knight Rider is gonna work out.
Trusty steed. Ha!
Lowering the face guard might benefit both of us.
Joan, coming out is more normal than being a knight in armor cycling into battle.
But what does the sub-squad do?
I prefer riding in the knight time.
What Renaissance Festival?
I don't want to be just a head in a jar.
I thought RAGBRAI was some sort of Viking invasion.
My horse is off today, enjoying his 4-day work week.
I think I need to take it in for a lube job, along with my bike.
I've heard that medieval armor is the next best thing to air bags in your car!
Which way to the jousting competition?
Out for a little knight riding?
80s Nostalgia is in, but a Knight Ride May have been too much
Portland is so different.
... the difference is "Back To The Future" was just a movie AND they used a car!!
Reception's still bad.  Maybe I should try the tin hat again.
You know you should carry a water bottle on your bike. These rides can really work up a sweat.
Skid Road is the next exit.
I'm returning the free suit that came with the helmet.
I know by all outward appearances that my safety suit looks confining. But in reality, the bells of freedom are ringing loud and clear in this new crotchless version.
I love your parents, but I’m not willing to go through airport security again.
Okay, I agree with you. The whole suit of armour probably wasn't necessary
The guy at the bike store said to wear a helmet
My trusty steed's in the shoppe.
I’m prepared should I fall from my trusty steed.
And yet I'm still getting catcalled.
She’s already started on the Tin Man  jokes... now what?
On your right. And do you know where I can buy a turkey leg drumstick?
Your Highness, I really shouldn't protect and text.
I haven't rode one of these in ages.
I dropped my damned lance, that's what!!
It just doesn't seem fair when the other knights use 4 wheeled mounts.
No, Lois, it’s only an 8 speed.
Hey, I'm calling you; why aren't you answering your phone?
The potholes around here aren't THAT bad!
Any interest in joining our group, Knights of the Round Wheel?
I’m looking for my Lance!
My chain mail needs oiling!
I guess I'm just looking to protect a broader range of body parts?
I'm checking with OnStar now as to our whereabouts!
Just some protection in case I run over any BABs.
...and insects are a REAL bitch!
Buy new pants?? I could have sworn you said you wanted to try my new lance!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I warned you - it's all downhill from here!!
Tell your manager that the armor is NOT bike friendly.
I thought I asked you to bring Lance
I feel safer, but if the urge to go comes, I may regret this.
It worked for Ghost Rider.
I'm safer sure, but I keep getting flat tires.
I've always been a knight owl.
Looks like rain, did you bring the oil can!
No, I ordered Chainmail oil, not Chain oil.  Seriously, what year is this?
My yellow jersey's at the cleaners
I thought I heard talk about a lance and needing to make sure my arms were strong...
I'm training for the Tour de Medieval France
Oh. Sorry. I meant night-riding.
G’day, Sheryl of  Cheshire Apartments!
On your right, Hasselhoff.
I'm better at jousting than long distances.
Aerodynamics are sweet. The chaffing is medieval.
I’ll do whatever it takes to win!
I told them I needed a quarter horse, not a bicycle course.  How much farther?
With today's drivers, you can't be too careful.
Wish I were Lance ArmStrong
My jousting horse lost a shoe.
If there’s a chink in my armor, it’s the downhills
The armor doesn't obviate the insanity.
Why don't we just cross the finish line together, holding hands?
It’s late, good night.
That homeless guy looked like Trump, Praise be.
What do mean a night ride?!
En-garde. On your right.
"I ran out of sun screen."
No wonder your wearing body armor. Dumbass
do you think this will give me enough sun protection ?
Can I call you back? I have to change gears on my steed.
You sure don't want to drop your phone at this speed; better hold it with both hands.
Vision Zero is running low on ideas since the Bike Mayor is spending all his time in Iowa.
Calling me Sir Bikes-a-lot isn't helping.
This is one lazy-ass horse.
Where is my Lance, Armstrong? I don't get it.
Why yes; I am the knight rider.
Mark Twain and King Arthur said hi
I'm saving a ton of money on carrots.
Since I got married, riding a bicycle hasn't been what it used to be.
HIS idea of a chastity belt.
'I know you got a great deal, but did it include brakes?'
These throwback trends are getting out of hand.
There's a mongrel on this ride I can't wait to have bite me.
I can buy the helmet and gloves, but the greaves are killing me.
The actual jousting part of it doesn't appeal to me.
The salesman said it’s required for night rides.
Good knight! It's hot ride today.
I'm not only better protected, but I also burn more calories.
Sometimes your knight and shining armor forgets his horse
It would be more convincing if your tires weren't exposed.
Jeff, don’t you think you’ve taken the 'Ironman' a little too literal?"
I'm not taking any chances. You would be horrified by the number of bicyclers killed in this city every year.
Over Armour...Over Armour!
I'm in on the ground floor.
My electronic helmet is giving a beep that I love you.
It's actually 'Sir Douchebag'
Bill, hold for a minute. I dropped my lance.
“Safety – It's Never Enough”
Hi, I'm Knightrider, passing on your left.
Is that 5G?
Don't you think biking when we could've just taken an Uber is a bit medieval?
Old technologies are good technologies.
Didn't do the laundry this week.
Forsooth, I’m being chased on the Highline. Bring my mace and hurry thyself.
Aye, my stallion is mechanic, what of it, Karen?
You mean these triggers aren't for the torpedos?
I am training for the Joan of Arc Tour De France.
I'll be molting soon.
That’s taking being a road warrior a little far, don’t you think?
This is the very latest in athletic fashion it
Your supposed to be on a white horse.
I'm protecting myself from 5G!
I thought you said that we were riding a Centurion.
Leave the phone at home and save some money on your wardrobe.
I’m one of the founding members of Knights on Bikes.
The armor’s carbon fiber, too - very light but doesn’t breathe...
But everyone was wearing this during the Tour de Franks...
This codpiece seems to be limiting my mobility.
bicycle is the new white horse
Do you still name them?
You know George I liked you better when you were a squire.
I don't think this medieval skin care routine is working out for me
My day job is a bike courier.
M'lady, sorry about season 8.
It's hard being a hipster. I had to dig even further into history to find a one of a kind outfit.
We’re all doing our best.
My life is going downhill too.
It's so much harder without a lance.
So I said to myself, "Percival, old chap, it's time to get on with the times and switch the horse for a bike!"
The bike and the armor was a package deal
It may be safer, but how often do you break a spoke?
I know — I thought they said, “Arm her.”
The final season was terrible.
I'm prepared for Manhattan.
Yeah, I'm still working on the flying thing.
It'll deflect a bullet or knife at 60 paces.
Since when did Superheroes bike to work?
My lady decreed I should exercise more.
Ask Alexa which way we turn."
John Kavanagh--Bellaire, M
Oh, this old thing?
He's a grabber and his name is Lance!
I actually find this helmet to be much more aerodynamic, and it even matches my suit!
You know drivers these days!
The peloton is two stories back.
Yeah, White Castle is on Seamless now.
Manhattan Grub Hub training?
Doth thee befall to knoweth wh're the nearest Chipotle is?
Can’t talk. I’m on a roll!
Do you feel safe wearing just that little mini helmet?
I thought time travel wasn't possible.
Chafing emergency... I need some under armor for my over armor.
Great sun protection...not waterproof!
It's more environmentally friendly, but on the down side there's no room for a lance.
No jousting on the High Line, apparently.
With a lance, it would just be cheating.
No one in my car pool actually said anything, but the nonverbal messages were pretty clear.
These days Tour de France and a trip around the world no longer should take eighty days...
Whilom, as olde stories tellen us, ther was a Knight's Tailwind
Knight riding...no lights required
I told my mom it was a night ride
I get it.  Anything can happen.
Also, from now on could you call me ‘The Hoff’
Someone’s got to fight for the environment.
Rabid finches in the park.
This is nothing like riding a horse.
Officer please...put the tire spikes only on the RIGHT  side of the road
You've heard of 'Joan of Arc'.  Well, I'm 'Joan of Central Park.'
In the 'burbs I'm known as Sir Falls-A-Lot.
Zis stage of ze Tour has taken me longer zan I expected.
You of all people should have let me go first!
To be honest, I'm only here testing new methods of virtue signaling, m'lady.
I'm the mascot for the tour du  france
I'm not so sure about my new "Over Armour" sponsorship.
Wait, you're breaking up... are you sure you're not entering a building or a tunnel?
On your knight!
I'm a knight on the steel horse I ride.
I Left My Horse At Home...
I might not win the race, but I will survive it!
Right, they don't do yellow jerseys anymore.
I've been invited to go cycling in the Swiss Alps."
Pardon me, Sir, are you a knight?  Because it isn't very chivalrous of you to go in front of me.
I know this is anachronistic, but I refuse to ride a horse to the Renaissance Faire.
I'm lost?
Nag, nag, nag - just let me ride in peace
I thought you literally meant we were getting Medieval.
No, that isn't Red Landing.
I know! Yeah, I think I took digital detox far way back
I refuse to battle traffic.
I'm a 3-D rebus: knight rider. You?
I'm suffering from an iron deficiency since the police said no lance allowed
Hello, police ?  There's a woman who looks just like me that's stalking me.
If I fall someone will hear the clanking sound.
My entire life is a LARP.
I just had to get away from all that Lance stuff. Lancelot was a no brainer.
Over Armour?"  Just not sure it wicks fast enough.
I just got rid of my car, but I still don't feel safe unless I'm encased in steel.  Do you think I should have gone for the Iron Man suit?
They told me it was the latest style and that everybody was switching over.
How far did you say 'til we hit clean air?
My trusty steed went to a damsel who, turns out, wasn't in distress.
Are you wearing Under Armour?"
Where's your lance? I don't joust on the first date.
That's great, John - but I still think chivalry is dead.
Let me know if you see a white knight.
Hey, you need protection to feel a new experience these days!
Now I know why your Social media user name is @knightrider
I could not love thee err so much, loved I not armor more.
Who said that chivalry doesn't run in cycles?
My horse is in the shop so I’m stuck biking.
Damn I forgot my shades.
I don’t think exercise would get you under the weight limit for the ride
The hard part is tilting .
Dorothy, this is the Yellow Brick Road.
This is my "Uber-All" bike outfit designed to protect me from all opening taxi doors.
So tell me. How do you like your telemarketing job?
I'd fit in perfectly at a lobster boil.
M'lady
I'm ready for preventable accidents."
Queens are doing the slaying now, so we got demoted to bikes.
You aught to wear something wither higher visibility when riding at knight
In Game of Thrones they never take them off.
Sponsored by Armor All. Why?
I'm afraid the yellow jersey won't stretch to fit over my breastplate.
I think this is more suited to winter riding.
I'm busy all day, so I only have time for knight rides.
Tell Merlin his shortcut didn't quite work, sire.
I forgot my lance!
This route goes past Trump Tower and Bergdorfs so I'm not taking any chances.
Yeah, I found this suit of armor at my local Goodwill. It was a total steel!
I never had to worry about my fertility on my last steed.
Is that to protect your body when you fall?

Not really, it’s to protect my identity on Amazon Prime Day.
I misread "safe guard protection" in the description.
Ni! Ni! Night My Lady
Ya, bike chain lubricant is pretty versatile.
This isn’t exactly what I had in mind when you said we’d ride off into the sunset together.
Is it dangerous?  Do I need my mace?
I choose to wear all this armor when cycling because of all the jerks that are looking at their iPhones instead of the roads.
The name’s Lancelot, but you can just call me Lance
I Charlemagne am invincible on my fiery steed Tencendur!
What am I doing? Being a knight in shining armor, of course.
Her Ladyship has gone vegan.
I told you you had to readjust your helmet!
I would regret it if it wasn’t 40% off retail
Find me on TikTok, @lancelot_armourstrong!
Good knight to you, sir!
We missed the last turn?
No, I don't know of a good fender repair shop.
Ride and talk don't Ride and Text.
Knights of the Cross??  I thought they said Knights of the Cross-Training!
No, I said chain oil, not chain mail.
I see the Middle Ages are ahead of me.
I meant as in "night and day"....
Whoops, it’s time for me to re-lube again.
I have taken peyote/mushrooms twice therefore I am ahead of you and the smog.
It's my Halloween costume. I'm a Knight Rider.
Pretty sure I said to buy the Under Ar
mour cycling gear...
You misunderstood. It's a product that makes your tires shine.
I have to hold the visor up like this while riding - otherwise my vision is zero.
I’ll feel safer.  The knights drive very aggressively.
What? Knight riding’s no picnic...
Now you're ready to take on Manhattan.
You've heard of performance enhancing drugs?  Well this is a performance degrading drug, except its not actually a drug, it is a kind of uniform to give protection.  It is made out of metal which is very heavy and makes it hard to move these pedals.
And that's why I gave up swimming.
Today, I'm a bike messenger, but you know the advice.
Why , I wear under armour,of course
What? You're having an acrophobia moment? We're just on a path CALLED the High Line!
My horse showed me a great shortcut this way.
Maybe some Under Armor would help..
i only wear this when cycling through central park...
Now, this is a helmet.
I never learned to drive, but loved the old series Knight Rider.
You should get an endorsement from Under Armour for wearing that Body Armor!
I made everything from recycled materials.
I just find Over Armour to be much more durable.
Hey, don't text and drive!  I'm right here.
I am going downtown.
The drag on my body is reduced; the less drag on, the better.
Want to race to the Dark Ages?
Joust, schmoust. Let's just ride.
Yes and my bike  also comes with the latest super light  carbon fiber alloy  frame!
They were out of Under Armour.
I'm allergic to sunlight.
I think you misunderstood about being cool in Under Armor.
Obey the traffic laws, and you can wear shorts
Look, I know I'm not dreaming - most drivers are aiming at us.
I want everything to be carbon fibre.
Did they have to hoist you onto your mount with a crane?
This iron woman contest is ridiculous
In fact I wear it all the time in case the knight in shining armor pun presents itself.
Chivalry isn't dead, but it could lose some weight.
Cool, but how do you deal with nature in that outfit?
Wasn’t there suppose to be a jousting segment in this triathlon?
You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find parking for a horse!
My horse left me to work for Medieval Times
Good Knight,  sir!  Pay attention to the road!
Just to let you know that's a dragon not an airplane"
I bet it was great to live 700 years ago.
I need to talk to a spokes person in the chain of command.
I thought 'Under Armour' was more of a literal thing.
It’s high modulus carbon fiber
The invite said NIGHT ride. I feel like you’re overdressed.
My suggestion is breathable fabrics and a good lawyer.
Cycling in Manhattan is more dangerous than you think
Wear Under Armor - not body armor
No, I'm not THAT Knight Rider.
Wow I can't hear or see
'butt ' I'm safe!
...and then he said, ‘sorry Carl, there’s not enough room at the table’.
KITT is in the shop.
A little less horsepower than I'm used to, but lower emissions are important these days.
I'm going to have to get a lot more information before I agree to another of your "night rides."
This.wasn’t. a good...
idea...
Listen, Janet, my lance is on my other bike. Otherwise I would be defending your honor.
Horse racing is the sport of kings.  This is all I could afford.
This is my knight outfit
Jousting was much safer than cycling in the City....
I threw down the gauntlet, but only because it didn't work on my phone's touchscreen.
Someone suggested I try knight riding to beat the heat.
This workout gear isn't as breathable as I thought it might be.
Pretending to be a knight-errant makes the ride a lot more interesting.
I seem to have lost my lance in the crowd behind us.
Your outfit won't offer any protection after sunset,either.
It's all downhill after this.
I don't watch much television so no, I didn't know it was Night Rider with an N
Pray tell, fair maiden, from whence is the Throgs Neck Bridge?
Another minute for hard fried.
I hear America's ass hurts.
Road rash phobia.
It's castleisure wear.
My horse joined the AHCLU so they now get Sundays off, 3 carrots a day, an apple twice a month, and conjugal stall visits.
Best new safety equipment money can buy!
It does create a lot of wind resistance but it does keep the bugs out of my teeth
I guess today is casual Friday
Fitbit Support, I've been cycling for an hour but the device seems to be broken. So did I even cycle at all?

GPS schmeeps.I think we took the wrong exit and lost the other racers
Looking for my missing varlet.
You must be a steel man...
I am not sure what just happened.  I started riding as as a competent and successful CEO and "poof" . . .I am in the middle ages.
The name's Arc, Joan of Arc
I don't usually do this, but I'm training for an Ironman.
This is easier and more exercise than jousting.
I thought you said you liked fast paced city knights.
I think my odds are better than yours.
Listen Karen, I don't think we can see each other anymore. How am I going to explain the excess leg muscles and rust on my suit to Deborah?
It chaffs.
Apparently chivalry IS dead.
It is better than coconuts
The drivers here are worse than dragons.
No sorry this is the other Knight Rider.
It’s my effort against global warming, bicycling recycling.
Can you direct me to the nearest damsel in distress?
Oh, the body armor? It's a girl thing that gives me the power to seek the ideal hookup without being poked along the way.
My mother said knight biking was dangerous but I feel totally safe.
No, a dragon isn’t the problem. I’m running late on a quest to save a damsel from an unfunny caption contest!
...and good day to you!
And I told him if I wanted a Knight to fight for me,
I'd be that Knight.
They say, amour conquers all!
I couldn't find a steed with e-assist.
I hoped you'd see it as a "Suit of amour".
Doctor's orders!
New tactic: slow gentrification by requiring gentry attire
Fine, but then let's drop by the farmer's market to buy a $6 tomato.
Bono, is that you?
If this is what I use to charge, I'd fall before the jousting begins.
It’s a wedding gift.  I should have never married a guy named Arthur King.
Grass prices in the city, am I right?
I’m a knight in shining Armor All

When they said knight ride I figured
I’d be chivalrous and give you a head start.
So, how long have you been riding your bike in New York?
Bike apparel: Day and Knight
It’s supposed to rain, but you never listen.
I'm a knight in shining bike
I just intended to get a helmet, but this suit was on sale!
I thought recycling would be much easier.
Do you know where the “Off Broadway “ area is ?, I’m running late for an audition, this suit was supposed to be done yesterday at the dry cleaners
hey are you holding?
No you are mistaken, David Hasselhoff drove a car on the television series Knight Rider.”
the left cyclist: Et tu, Brute
the right cyclist: May the Force be with you
You’ve heard of the Knight Errant? Well, I’m the Knight Errand!
Oh. Night ride.
Fear not, fair lady. If the mayor shan’t, I shall protect thy bike lane.
It's a new brand, Over Armour.
Just protecting the moneymaker.
I'm a big fan of knight rider
I'm on my way to The Renaissance Fair.
It’s just like riding a horse
Maintenance on my cycling gear is as much as a bus pass.
You got a can opener on you by any chance?
Yeah, my horse is still on maternity leave.
Let's face it, chivalry is dead.
Damsel in distress. Lame charger. Gotta fly. Get a better helmet.
It's convenient, but the horsepower's a little low.
I meant, "Let's go night riding".
Better safe than sorry!
When was the last time they closed the FDR Drive?
My joints feel a little stiff too.
Do you also bike at night?
That yellow chain mail is as good as mine.
There must be a mote in my eye.
Just steeling myself for the climb...
I wasn't sure if you said ride a bike at night or ride a bike as a knight
This is the only way to attract my knight in shining armor!
I’m of the literary cycle of the Matter of Britain.
Well, the suit came with the helmet.
It's fine as long as you don't pass any MRI machines
Yes, I have Under Armour's cycling underwears
My horse fuckin' died.
I'm not a nervous Nellie; I'm just going for the burn.
You missed your exit. Jousting was exit 23!
You must be the new D.A from Quuens!
It's from the new line "Cuirass- for Couriers"
I guess when I asked him to 'get me Under Armour,' he must have heard 'get me under armor.'
I’m a Knight rider.
Oh, I loved Moonchaser, but she just guzzled grass.
No, not that Lance. Like, a lance.
Wait, you ride horses when jousting?
The government is going retro so I thought so would l.
I may LOOK odd, but I won't get hurt ANYwhere, not just not on my head!
It's more like a night thing.
Do they call feminists 'clamor girls'
Triple Fitbits.
My bicycle helmet didn't suit the rest of the outfit.
It's an existential crisis. Do you have any idea what your carbon hoofprint is?
Slow down, Knight-Rider!
I usually ride at night
K.I.T., Meet me at the bottom of the hill. I can't shake this tail
I joust don’t know what to say.
I'm a professional sprinter. You need this outfit in Tour de France Stage Finishes!
No, I said yes to an evening ride but it will be hard to the see the address at night.
With rare exceptions, I skip the fiction.
Why won't you debate me?
Biking without performance enhancing drugs is, I’m told, the key to people liking Lancelot more.
Ah, we've got a bit of a downhill here. Then I'll need you to pedal again.
The invitation said it was a party for the Middle Age!
Yes I like to bicycle, walk along the ocean, and read mysteries,  but looking for my knight in shining armor was just a phrase.
Hey, did you get your outfit at Bean's"
It's more arrow dynamic...
Whew!  Those uphills totally drain me,  but I don't dare go for my water bottle.
An easy ride you promised, not another one of your crusades!
Harry what happened to your horse?”
He got hit by a car 
on my last night ride.
I'm not jousting, you look like a knight rider.
You never know what you might run into.
I said we should "bike at night" not '"bike as knights."
Onward, my friend, I'm late for an audition at the White House.
In case the brakes fail.
I thought this was what you meant by "going out for a knight ride".
Don't worry, it breathes . . . sort of.
Being knighted is pretentious enough, never mind being picked up in a limo.
Safety first amirite?
Tell the dragon he can either spew flames into the ether or he can wait until I get there.
Dude, you don't need a suit of armor cycling in this neighborhood you just need a helmet.
Why, yes, I am heading to an Antifa get together.
I think I'm just taking gentrification to its logical conclusion.
Look, you dress for the job you want. Duh!
Do you hear something rattling?
I think I back pedaled a little too long.
I agree a race requires mettle. But...
Of course I think your bicycle looks quite intimidating—much more so than any horse at the tournament.
I'm doing the Tour de Byzantine Empire.
I couldn't get the brakes fixed but I'm on my way.
Does my lady doth think my steed has a flat tire?
you're not on white stallion!
Thine eyes dost not deceive thee, m’lady! Chivalry tis alive and well! Methinks thou regret not responding to my OK Cupid message now!
No, my name is not, Para Noid.
No, I'm not afraid of another spill.
I prefer to ride at knight.
It's G.O.T. approved.
I’m on my way to the joust right now but you may be disappointed.
It came with the bike, which is called a Lancer
How about a nightcap at my place?
That's an impressive antenna you're wearing.
I can perhaps understand why now, but not why you wore it last Knight in bed
These days I ride a bike even in my dream.
Haha, I can see how you might get that impression, but I’m actually one of those guys who thinks birth control shouldn’t be my responsibility
...but the bike is carbon fiber
This is aerodynamic armor.
My horse stole my car...
Anyway, all I really said to him was "Good knight, sir"
You forgot the body bag.
Dude, you have got to lay off the shrooms...
The Tour just isn't the same without Lance.
Jousting on horses is so medieval.
Up here on the roof, you never know who might want to joust with you.
Don't be stupid Lance, there is NO WAY to conceal this!
Ever feel like your life is one of those weird New Yorker cartoons?
Yeah, I think the Knight Rider was something completely different.
Biking is great exercise for me, Pillaging is murder on the Gluts as much as it is on the villagers.
You forgot my jousting lance?  This will be so embarrassing.
Who cares if Joan of Arc is in town?
Well, with the new congestion zone traffic will become faster!
It's not so much the rocks and sticks, but the damn lances are brutal!

I gave up Spandex for 'THIS!'."
I'm training for Space Force.
5G protection?
I am falling hard for you.
I thought we were wearing under armour today.
Customer service at eHarmony please! When she said she wanted to date a guy who uses protection, a suit of armor is not what she meant.
Release the dragon!
Wait...you mean the C is SCA doesn't stand for cycling?
The suit gives me historical perspective.
You haven't seen a lance anywhere, have you?
The fiberglass helmet just isn’t enough. The knight’s armor is a bit heavier but is more effective and aids losing weight.
Remind me why I traded my steed for a 10-speed.
It's called the "Lance Strong Armor."
I decided to move on from my paleo routine.
P.E.D.’S: Peloton Enters Drawbridge Stage
I confess. I’m a middle-aged David Hasselhoff fan.

This next section is my protest against the 4th street ONE WAY NORTH!  Then Smoothies and Band-aids at the South Shore Bistro.
No. I'm not calling you "Knight Rider".
Can't. I've already committed to a hipster rally on Thursday. Let me ask my parents for some more money, and I'll get back to you.
I thought you said 'riding as a knight,' not 'at night.'
Those escooters are a menace!
My mother says you can never be too safe.
We need to reinvent horses
I thought you said something about a lance?
I thought you said to go for a Knight ride.

This is nothing, it's extreamly harder when I bring my lance.

Does this outfit make me look fat?
So you're from Camelot?
This traffic is brutal.
I know I took the Night ride literally, but it's really reflective.
It’s from the armor with bike share program
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
Yes, there are hazards, but a lance isn't one of them.
I switched when I heard this method of travel no longer employs a lance.
I'm running late.  My steed is in the shop.
Honey, it's Amsterdam. I'm being smart.
It’s slower than my horse, but results in less chafing.
Are you a damsel in de-stress?
Knight Rider Here.
It's like knight and day.
I'm prepared to ride all day and all knight.
My steed ist in ye shoppe.

It’s 5g, not a time machine.
I'm riding the Tour de Lancelot.
It’s my editor about edits to “Hot Knights in the city.
Cars still have the “Right of Way”, you know?
Well who put the tampons in the fridge?
Fare thee well m'lady. I must ride my trustye steede to Bushwycke where, I am tolde, I shall finde younger ladyes of loose morals to fucke...and, perhcance, some mead and cocayne.
My voices are telling me to turn left.
Sir Chafes-a-lot is more like it, Lance.
Do I recognize you from somewhere, perhaps King Arthur’s court?
I'm hardened for city arteries.
It’s a faster way of moving from C-3, to B-5
Great time for a knight ride
The kingdom's facing severe budget cuts. Mead was the first to go, then horses...
I wouldn't be afraid of road rash if the streets were cleaner.
'Your late Joan it already started .
I gotta go pee
My horse insurance is too expensive this month.
I'm telling you, the Tour de France is not going to believe you're Joan of Arc.

I mix and match Snell and DOT standards.
I said, let's ride at NIGHT!
She's allergic to horses
They said I'd be safer in this outfit, but the damn visor keeps blocking my view.
This was easier when I had the black car.
My white steed died. I'm riding my converted tilting lance.
I'm a Beta tester for Bell
I'm not Spider Man, I'm the Night Knight Biker!
No. No this loner doesn’t even have Bluetooth.
What? you said we were going knight biking.
Biking is a great warm up for jousting.
I think your chainmail’s slipped off.
It's easy on the joints.
Gawain here.  Is my new chain mail ready yet?  I need it for my next Ironman.
Going to the Game of Huffys festival today !
Getting back to the basics.  Like Crossfit only with a bicycle.
Leaving the bike lane?

Sir Lancelot Armstrong passing to your left!
Look, my LARP was cancelled. I’m wearing this somewhere.
I thought we were knight riding?
Yup, this week they've got me product testing over armour. And, nope, it's not breathable.
I wrote that 'I like bike riding and chess' in my 'about me' section. Since I forgot my selfie stick, those claims will come off as inauthentic without a collaborating profile pic.
You have reached Knightrider, I'm not in at the moment, but if you leave your name, number, and message.....
I think my steed  needs a new derailleur.
I'm ready for anything, even running for President.
It's funnier when I am riding at night
Don’t worry, it’s a passing fad.
Under Armor just wasn't working for me!
It's the rent-a-bikes you have to watch out for.
Come on, get the lead out!
I said a "night errand" not "knight errantry."
My arm is strong, but I forgot my lance.
I wear it because it elevates my bpm, lowers LDL and covers my PJ's
Lady there are a LOT of bird scooters through here!
What? You're going to tell me you've never seen a Connecticut Yankee?
Oh, you recommended Under Armour!
Promise me you will still stop for traffic lights!

Don't laugh. It's part of the latest Vision Zero initiative.
I'm not afraid, but prefer a good stallion.
Prithee...such a question,  a proper knight always has "Under Armour" under their  armor.
Siri, does the Highline have any downhills?
There be dragons in Jersey.
I'm retrofitting it next week with blinking lights.

You’re right Rebecca. This IS safer than biking at night.
I'm just going to the Fashion week
For the same reason my horse sleeps standing up.
Watch me use my knight rider turbo boost!

Good night, Knight.
Just wrapping up our safety teleconference, then we can pick up the pace
I guess we will just have to agree to disagree on the effectiveness of  Vision Zero
No, I'm not crusading for more protective bicycle gear.
These city bike lanes require extra protection!
This looks stupid awkward bad, I know.  But I fall and crash into things a lot.
This isn't the Trek I had in mind.
Totally agree, sir: we're destined to crush the Yankees tonight.
I had to do with this after the siege tower broke down.
Love the downhills.  I'm beat.
It's more squeaky than my old Schwinn.
This Vision Zero intititive is really working well!
This is the start of the recurring dream I've been having every night, over and over...and yet I never remember it the next day. Not to freak you out or anything.

Lancelot or Armstrong?

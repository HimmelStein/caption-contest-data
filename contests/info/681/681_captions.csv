I don't mind autumn so much; it's the fall I hate.
Congratulations. You're now the branch manager.
Deciduous? When were you going to tell me
I'll wait for you on the car.
I've led a good life, but now it's time to meet my raker.
You said we’d BOTH go on three!
It’s not you. It’s November.
As usual, you're never ready when it's time to leave.
Seems to me you have problems letting go.
Give me a call when you get to the ground. We'll do mulch.
Here's hoping a leaf blower is what I think it is.
On the bright side, we lasted longer than any member of the current administration!
Sorry to leave you hanging.
Aim for the Johnson's yard -- they don't rake.
I heard our branch was letting everyone go but didn't want to believe it.
I don't think you're grasping the gravity of the situation.
Fall! Now I get it!
I’m worried I’ll find you lying in a gutter somewhere.
I told you it was a seasonal position
Whatever happens, at least we're not nuts.
That's why we're called leaves; it's what we do.
I don't want to move to Florida, you said. I'd miss the changing of the seasons, you said.
Kermit was wrong...it was easier being green
Nature calls! Gotta go!
”Don’t be sad. We’ll be buds again in the Spring.
We’ll always have summer.
I've been faking photosynthesis for weeks now.
I love the colors, but I hate the fall.
Think of this as not the end, but a leaf of absence.
Let me know if he gets impeached!
I forget... Is it "fall forward" or "fall back?"
I'm falling for you. There, I said it.
If you stay, you'll never amount to mulch.
You never think it's going to happen to you.
I asked my mother "What will I be?
Will I be compost?
Will I be free?
Will I be just debris?"
Now is the autumn of my discontent.
Watch this, reverse 3 and a half somersaults with a half twist.
The answer, my friend....
I'm off to the after-leaf.
Head for the gutter; you’ll last for years.
But how will I know it’s you?
I admire your conviction, Walter, but denying season change is not a thing.
The answer my dear is ”blowing in the wind!”
And now, I'm going to meet my raker.
We had joy, we had fun, we had...well, one season in the sun.
Call me when you land.
Seasonal Affective Disorder brings me down every year
I'm being transferred to a different branch.
And my will is in the loose leaf binder.
Forget the whistleblower, it’s the leaf blower you gotta watch out for!
Sometimes letting go is the hardest part.
C'mon! Don't be so indeciduous!
Are you aware of the gravity of this situation?
On 3 - you were supposed to go on 3!
Perennials, they all act so entitled.
I don’t care what Kermit said, it WAS easy being green...
No, no -- you're confusing weather with climate.
I hate being the last one to leave.
Best case scenario is we wind up in the same student's art project.
Penultimate. Look it up.
We survived a caterpillar for this?!
Quick! Tell me the punchline!
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is the end.
I always thought you would leave me first
Don't forget to turn off the sap when you leave!
Dammit, Darrel.
I'm aiming at that convertible and hope to finish up in a nice place in the country."
You feeling okay? You still look a little green.
Why is that everyone I meet leaves?!
I said if ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in Springtime.
But I voted Remain!
Oh Frank, it's beautiful......I see a white light, and grandma, and cousin Eddie....."
The hard part is just letting go.
My therapist is helping me work through my attachment issues.
Here goes -- I'll see you in the after-leaf!
Calling it autumn is just a form of denial.
I told you it wouldn't stop with the acorns.
'First they came for the maple leaves, and I did not speak out--Because I was not a maple leaf.'
I'm sorry; I just snapped.
Hurry up Martha; before all the good spots are taken.
It’s not you. I’ve changed.
Guess this is what it's like to be a Trump adviser.
What do you mean you changed your mind?!
I'm ending it all. I just heard someone say I was the color of Trump.
I hate to see us fall apart, but I need to be the one that leaves.
I'll never forget the way you rustled!
We’ve both changed, Helen.  That’s why I have to leave.
We're leaves.  We can't stay.
I’m heading to Vermont where at least I’ll be appreciated.
It was nice hanging out with you.
Sorry, I just have attachment issues.
It’s not about letting go, it’s about letting the wind take you places you have never been.
'Autumn' doesn't quite capture the existential dread of this moment.
It was a fun summer but I have attachment issues.
After all that photosynthesis,I can’t believe we are being let go!
I just want you to know this has been the best 6 months of my  life
Did you realize the gravity of our situation?
Winter? I'm pretty discontent now.
I know I’m not a tree and this isn’t a forest, but let me know if you hear anything when I fall.
We’re going to amount to mulch
Hang tough until the snow and really piss them off."
I just pray they're baggers, not burners.
Thanks Harry. You have a great Fall too.
My goal is to get into a kindergarten show and tell
Remember, aim for that spot right where the hood meets the windshield
Well this blows.
As usual, you are going to let me take the fall.
Detached? I’ll show you detached!
Everyone leaves
Seriously, do you not know what deciduous means?
Gonna drift by a window.
Ah, fall.  I get it now.
I hope there's an after-leaf!
I hope to reincarnate as an Evergreen.
Don't look surprised you knew how this was going to end.
Dude......delete my browser history!
It's over. We've changed.
First I change colors...and now this?
Storm the lawn. They can't rake all of us!
Shoot for the Wilson's. They never rake.
Face it, baby. The chlorophyll is gone.
You’re late, as usual.
I'm not leaving you, I'm falling for you.
I guess this makes you the new branch manager.
I'll see you on the street.
My tine has come.
I’m leaving you Doris. It was only a summer fling.
Good luck Mr. Pence.
I'm not falling, I'm descending into old age gracefully.
Oh well, nature calls.
It's like a ride share, but the city picks you up.
Well Rustle, it was fun shooting the breeze, but it's time for me to leaf.
Never let go, Rose.
You're the last leaf on the tree.  You deserve a bough.
And I was just getting the hang of it...
I'm coming back as an evergreen.
Who the hell  could possibly make a song out of this?
Meet me at the Henderson's. They don't mulch.
You are right - we should have tried stem cell therapy.
I've changed, we both have.
I'm hoping for burial in a compost heap rather than cremation.
And I thought it was hard being green.
You need to learn to let go
Fall already? I just got tan!
We tried - but these May to December romances fall apart around October.
Wow, Branch Manager in under a year!
Do you think people know we do this alphabetically, Zyggy?
Looks like I have to be the fall guy.
Horrible timing, eh? Now we'll never find out if he got impeached.
I just can’t date a climate change denier.
Frankly, I'm embarrassed to be orange.
It's one small leaf for man,one giant mess for mankind.
Look, they don't call this season "Hold!"
Come on, we're half in the bag already.
There’s a rumor they’re closing down the branch.
Beat this. A half gainer with a full twist.
Will you finally admit that photosynthesis was not some wacky conspiracy theory?
Remember to set the clock back!
Sure, the colors are nice, but what did I really achieve?
Why do I have to be the fall guy?
Well, my friend, I'm off to find out if the answer really is just blowin' in the wind.
Remember, you promised Mom you won’t end up in the gutter.
I should have moisturized!!
It's been arboreal!
No - honestly, I’m falling for you.
To infinity, and the lawn!
I don’t think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
I slept with your sister.
Oh crap. You win.
You sure? Everyone's going to be there!
So you know the drill.  Once this anal idiot has raked us all up you fall.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I was falling for you!
Spring will be such a releaf
I'm just not as strong as you Bob,  I just have to do what everyone else is doing.
This is where I leave you.
I've always preferred the word autumn.
So much for your theory about drinking six glasses of water a day.
I am not afraid of the fall, It is the leafblower  that I am terrified of.
At some point in life, we all have to just let go.
I told you everybody suddenly turning orange wasn't a good sign.
I guess those coniferous bastards will have the last laugh now.
No, really, it was an honor to serve in your Administration!
Oh no, this is premature evacuation
This place is dead anyway.
I guess that makes ME the new Secretary of Homeland Security.
Seasons change and so did—AAH!
Stay golden, bro.
Wait...What do you mean, 'I look rakish'
I hung around for as long as I could.
I think that’s my Uber.
This is the last time I explain inevitably to you.
I didn't realize that I would end up the fall guy!
Well, screw you, tree, and the acorn you rode in on.
It's ok.Just try to compost yourself.
We had joy, we had fun, we had a season in the sun.
Just remember....I don't want to be cremated!
I know I should be all like, 'Wheeee', but I'm more like 'Meh.'
Big deal. So you're the last ! You know what they say about pride, don't you ?
I hope I land face up
So long pal, it's been a breeze.
Remember- Tuck and Roll!
Would it be too ironic to shout 'Geronimo' on Columbus Day?
Don’t be sad. We knew we were going out on a limb with this relationship.
I want to be raked, not blown.
I just want to feel more grounded.
We used to be buds!
I'll be waiting on the car.
I think I understand now, why you said you felt detached.
Hope falls eternal.
In the end, everyone leaves.
See, I told you there's a reason it's called Fall.
The wind is from the south so let's go with Evacuation Plan B--meet on the front porch steps.
I'm heading for his wiper blade.  It's my only chance to see the world.
They were right, we ARE going to end up on the street!
Nature calls.  I really gotta go.
I can’t believe you’re leaving me hanging like this!
Before I go, I should confess I've photosynthesized with your sister.
Depending on where you land, this conversation is not over.
Clear my Search history
Well this is what I've been telling you since April.
Looks like you're the last one in the administration ... remember: stall. obfuscate,attack,repeat.
We are both going down, no matter what you think.
It's not a phase, mom.
Yeah I'm free, I'm free fallin'
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
Aim for the hedge, they can't rake there.
You'll love it, all our friends are there.
Delete my browser history!
Been great hanging with you!  See you in the compost heap?
Look, we're leaves. That's what we do.
I don’t want to be composted without you
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes...
All things orange must come to an end - like autumn leaves and awful presidents.
Well, I hope you find that car with a Florida license plate.
Well, I’m gonna hit the road.
Gonna see what all the fuss is... I'll be right back.
Now I know what you meant when you said it was going to be a long fall.
Wish me luck. Gonna try for the front porch.
I always hoped I'd go first.
I thought you said on three?
If ever I would leave you it would have to be in autumn.
Mulch obliged.
Don't worry, we'll be together again in a little pile.
Are you coming to the Fall reunion?
Don't forget-bend at the knees.
One great leaf for mankind
I want to come back as a pine needle.
I'm going for the windshield. Meet me there.
Tell my acorns I love them.
Looks like I'm leaving.
I want to be red and I want to lie around on the ground– what's not to understand?
Why? The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind.
Its crunch time.
Don't worry--the fall is FAKE NEWS.
Don't fall for anyone else.
You were dead inside, anyway.
I hate this part, soooo literal.
Sorry, I just can't handle watching another Democratic debate.
It could be worse. Remember what happened to the acorn yesterday?
Other than this, it really is my favorite season.
Didn't you hear? They're closing our branch.
Remember, top of the Empire State Building, six months from now.
It's no use. I'm leaving.
I always thought you would go first!
Watch me stick this landing.
If you make another "fall" pun, I swear to God I'll throw myself from this tree.
Farewell! I'm off to meet my Raker.
Please don't quote Ecclesiastes.
So… now that we’re finally alo—
We both knew this was just a May October romance anyway.
I want to get down there before the best spots are all taken!
Sorry Mr President, I've decided to testify.
Don’t act so surprised. You know we’ve both changed.
My therapist said it's time to let go.
But all the leaves are brown and the sky is grey! How will you find me?
Joyce Kilmer never mentioned this!
I'm going to meet the Grim Sweeper.
I told you eating all that kale was a waste of time.
Good luck with your attachment issues.
Remember, don’t buy annuities.
Why didn’t they tell us about this when we were buds?
Retirement feels different than I imagined!
Remember. Catch southeast winds, meet top floor Empire State Building in six months
Let's face it, it was just a Summer thing.
My ambition is scrapbook, but I'll end up compost.
You never think it'll happen to you.
Sorry, babe, but I gotta go where the wind takes me.
It's a reverse triple somersault with a double twist.
This is why it's called Fall, Phil.
We were together all summer! And then a little headwind comes along and you blow me off.
What more can I say, Helen? Seasons change.
Okay I lied, we're not Evergreens.
But all my friends are jumping, Mom!
This is why I prefer the term "autumn."
and now I’m off to meet my raker
Sorry, but you’re way too clingy.
Don't be so in-deciduous!
I never got to show you my true colors...
This is actually the fun part.  It’s the rake you need to worry about.
Let's do mulch sometime.
That's it! I'm leaving.
To sway ... perchance to fall! Aye! There's the rub!
No! I'm not ready to meet my raker!
I'm blown away!  LITERALLY... blown away...
I always said I'd go skydiving before I died.
Well no actually, fall is not my favorite season.
But you said you were falling for me!
I'm leaving you, I'm falling for someone more grounded.
LIMERICK:
A little oak leaf named Jaker,
Was rattled last night in a shaker
From the tree he was shed.
The last words that he said,
"I'm off to meet the Grim Raker"
So much for the Green New Deal.
I hear Warren has a plan for this.
It was deciduous, Larry. The whole time it was deciduous!
Wait.  I can't hear you.  You're breaking off.......
I always thought you’’d be the one to go first.
Well, I didn't know that turning over a new leaf meant this.
You'll find me down there. How many talking leaves can there be?
I always knew you'd leaf me.
OK, so I lied. We ARE deciduous - on my Mother's side.
Oh I get it now- that’s why it’s called fall
I'll never leave y....never mind!
I'm leafing you, Henry.
I guess I'll soon know if there is an afterleaf.
I'm falling, and I can't get back up!
Eighteen billion leaves can't be wrong!
Glad I hung on until they passed the No Leaf Burning Ordinance.
There's my Uber
I don't care what you say, 57 billion other leaves can't be wrong!
Fall?! I was pushed!
I’m surprised we hung around this long.
Hopefully we end up in the same bag!
Oh, snap!
Aim for the pick-up with Florida plates!
Falling is easy. Comedy is hard.
Nat King Cole made this whole thing sound so romantic.
My dermatologist recommended exfoliation.
Stop telling everyone to "have a good fall", Jerry.
It's okay, I believe in decomposition.
Well, it was nice hangin' together.
Don't worry, I'll take the fall.
We're all getting together later.
Life's a beech,  then you die.
Please God -- let us come back on an evergreen.
I told you I was leaving in the fall
Winter, Spring, Summer, Cling?
It's called Fall for a reason, Maureen.
My therapist says you need to learn to let go.
What do you mean, do it gracefully?
I so wanted to see Trump get impeached before I went...
Sorry to leave you hanging but I've got to go.
Screw the Golden Years,  Lila!
I'm leaving you for more colorful and down to earth friends.
Two leaf or not to leaf; that is the question
So much for the Golden Years.
I'll try and find us a spot on the sidewalk, but no promises.
Double or nothing, I bet you I land on the car.
My stem cell therapy failed.
Who knows maybe we’ll meet again in some pile, somewhere.
And you said the golden years will be the best."
Crunch time!
Shall we join the others?
But mom, everyone else is doing it.
You were adopted
This is when I wish I was born a pine needle.
They say it’s the most severe type of seasonal affective disorder.
Be glad that it's fall ... usually these cartoons are strictly black & white
I don’t care if you ground me, Mom.  Everybody else is going!
If I land on the car, you owe me twenty bucks.
Time to hit the road.
You've changed. I'm leaving.
This isn’t the end:  I’m gonna be the star of some kid’s fall collage.
I'm voting Green this time.
Rake me when it's over
Gotta go. I see my Uber.
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee - I fly!
I see now that I’ve misjudged you for moisturizing.
This blows.
See you on the street.
On the bright side, at least they don't burn us anymore.
Of all the seasons to fall in love
That new moisturizer seems to be working for you.
Tell the acorn I’m nuts about him!
"May the road rise up to meet you."
They named an entire season after this. Make it count!
Wow, freefall! Now I know what Rudy Giuliani must feel like.
Aw no! Just when I start to tan.
I'm going to meet my raker!
I’ll try not to start composting until you get there.”
I thought going green would save us.
Well...this is it.
Ashes to ashes, mulch to mulch
Hang on Jimmy, I'm going for help!
I think this qualifies as fashionably late.
I should go... tree's a crowd.
It’s time for me to branch out.
They say the rake up is the hardest part.
Help, I'm falling and I can't get up.
It's only scary if you're yellow.
Pride goeth.
I can't hang with you anymore, I'm getting grounded
. . . and so to a rake's progress.
In my next life I want to be an evergreen.
It's not you - it's me. I'm just feeling rakish.
Come on, it’s a breeze!
I'd like to come back as an evergreen.
It's okay, we do this every year.
I feel like we're drifting apart.
We'll always be buds.
It’s better to have leaved and lost than never to have leaved at all.
We both knew it was a May-October relationship.
I saw it coming, but I'm still blown away.
But anyway . . . , to make a long story short . . . .
You stay alive! You hear me? Whatever happens you stay alive!
I stayed with you as long as I could.
Oh come on, everybody’s doing it.
Remember I want to be cremated,not raked.
I'm being let go.  I'll let you know where I land.
What I'll miss are the youthful pleasures, like photosynthesis.
I hope I stick the landing.
Based on the wind direction and velocity, I should be at First and Elm when you jump.
Looks like my ride's here.
But Mr President, I did say I'd stay only as long as there was some hope of your re-election.
Iiiiiiiiieeeeeeiiiiii will always love yoooooooooooou!
It was a pleasure hanging out with you!
Bagged or burned, I don’t care, I just don’t want to be blown down the block by some guy with a giant hair dryer.”
Hurry, spots are filling up quickly!
You’re grounding me?
I can't hang with you any more.
And worst of all, they don't rake, they mow.
Page 424 - 'Moby Dick' - find me!
It would be a lot more empowering if they called it "Leap," instead of "Fall,"
You'll give in. You resisted social media for a while, too.
I always knew the tree loved you the most.
Yeah I'm FREE.....Freeeefallllliinnnnn
You are the Branch Manager now, Goldie.
Hell no, we won't go!
Hey, I thought you said  we’d BOTH jump on three!
The Wright brothers first flight lasted 59 seconds  ...  I know I can beat that.
O.K., you win "Last to Fall", but I've still got a shot at "Last to Decay".
Oh no!  I always thought Mother Nature would make an exception in my case!
Better this than The Very Hungry Caterpillar!
I didn’t think we’d ever fall apart!
We’ve both changed.
Always the nonconformist!
You said gravity was a theory!
It’s not the impact that kills you. It’s the Fall.
I’ll probably just fall for some rake.
Keep your mind - and yourself - out of the gutter.
I swear if you say 'have a nice trip; see you next fall' we're no longer friends.
I've known you for less than a year and I think I'm falling for you!
Oh no! You're right! Fall is more descriptive than Autumn.
It started out as a little dryness in my T-zone.
Frankly Scarlett, I don't give a damn!
I've fallen for you
...but I'll miss you most of all, my darling, whennn..!
Oh c’mon Phil, everybody’s doing it.
I hope in my next life I end up on an evergreen.
I'll never go out on a limb for you again.
This is the last day to use my skydiving Groupon.
You promised we’d leave together!
Fall is my least favorite season.
I hope you fall near me so we get swept up together.
Before you fall, Mom said you're adopted.
Well, whaddya know.  I guess it IS the fall that kills ya.
When I get settled you should really come over.
It's sad that our fall comes just when our color peaks.
FOR ONCE, COULDN'T YOU JUST GO WITH THE FLOW..
It's been a wonderful six months. I hope you can hang on.
Looks like you win the tree!
Be brave Harold, you may  get picked up and become part of a seasonal centerpiece.
They never tell you what happens when the sap stops flowing!
This isn't what I meant when I said feel myself falling for you.
I'm having trouble being existential about this.
Fall, Foliage!
Well, maybe next time, I'll be coniferous.
Suddenly I've come to realize that the climate may be changing.
So why am I the fall guy?
Leave.
You blew me away!
Well, Charlie, I guess you’re the last one left from this branch of the family.
It's okay. I  believe in an afterleaf.
Well, I guess you won.
Race you to the bottom!
Hey!! I thought we were letting go 'on three'?
Rosebud!
It's not the fall that kills you, it's the fall.
Come on! They're all leaving without us!
Goodbye old friend. Now comes the mystery.
I know why it's called "Fall" now!
It's not fair. I changed.
And so, I leave.
Obviously I’m not the only one who’s fallen for you.
You didn't win, I'm just tired of this game.
Deciduous  is as Deciduous  does.
Nice hanging with you...
It's time to find out what happens after the fall.
And they say April is the cruelest month!
Arrgh. I still had two seasons of 'The Sopranos' left.
Frankly, I prefer going out this way then ending up in Assisted Living.
I guess we shouldn't have rejected the Green New Deal"
Never fails, just when I'm at my peak .....
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
I guess you really are Mom's favorite.
Meet me in the gutter and we'll make plans from there.
This is my least favorite season so far.
I told you these weren’t isolated incidents.
You’re deciduous too, you know.
See you at the bonfire?
Well, I tell myself it's not the destination but the journey that counts.
I don't know about you...but this has never been my favorite season.
You said we'd let go on 'three.'
Dude, relax, it's a breeze.
I thought we said on ‘Go’
Well, blow me down!
Tell O. Henry I loved his work.
We’ll catch up in the compost pile.
We agreed to release on three!
I've decided that I need to see other leaves.
I love you more today than yesterday -- but not as mulch tomorrow.
Stay there. I'll go for help.
We'll always have Columbus Day weekend!
What do you mean by "herd mentality"?
I'm casting my fate to the wind
I'm leaving now. Try to beat the snow.
I’m out of chlorophyll... go on without me!
I just want to be a little more grounded.
I'll see you mulch later.
At least they've banned burning...
This is still better than being a pumpkin.
I believe we're about to fall on hard times.
Come on! Everyone's doing it. Let yourself go.
All summer together, and it ends like this.
Marcia, stop blaming yourself, you just have to learn to let go!
Aim for the car grill, we can be together forever.
Hope I get into one of those jumpin’ piles.
We knew at best it was a May-December relationship.
I had really hoped to last until the Impeachment vote.
I hope I land face up just to freak out the bipeds
We'll always have that pine tree in Paris.
Achoo!
I always thought it was just a metaphor
We both knew it would come to this
George, I think it's time for us to consciously uncouple.
c'mon, we're late!
Quick pinch me, I'm having that falling dream again!
Trust me, in a day or two you'll see I'm right.
I think it's time to leave.
What, me worry?
It's not you, it's not me; it's just Fall.
These May-October romances never last.
Goodbye, my frond.
Now I know how a Trump aide feels.  Nothing like giving it your all and then being kicked to the curb.
I should've spent more time with my buds!
I slept with your wife!
Ashes to ashes, mulch to mulch."
Don't worry, all your friends are waiting for you.
Oh, great - now I’ll have to make small talk with everyone about the weather.
Remember what they say--there's dog poop everywhere down there.
People just come by to watch us die.
This is not what I meant when I said branch out.
The hardest part is letting go.
It's been a great summer together.  I hope we get swept up together in the fall.
Noooo! What aboout our summer vacation plans?
I went out on a limb for you, Summer, but you've changed.
First the color change, now this!
I'll miss hanging out together.
Now is the winter of our discontent...
Looks like you're the branch manager now.
I hate leaving like this!
I'm sorry, Gladys, I'm leaving. But you knew this was just a summer thing we when started...
The peer pressure is just too much.
We’ll always have last summer.
Okay, I give. You're the bigger procrastinator.
Isn't it obvious, Harold? I'm leaving you.
Raking up is hard to do...
It looks like you will be the last one to leave.
I didn’t take the severance package!
Come on, it's a Flash Mob.
Did you request cremation or burial in a compost pile?
You must be the answer, as you're the only one left blowing in the wind.
Don’t overthink it Karen,
Just close your eyes and jump!
You call it deciduous, I call it karma.  In the next life I’m coming back as a Douglas fir.
Sorry to leave you hanging like this!
I did tell you not to sneeze
Remember when we were green and naive?
I'm free, free fallin'
Remember me as the first leaf to call for his impeachment.
I'll be ok.  I'm poplar.
If Ever I Would Leave You,
It Couldn’t Be in Autumn ...”
... Oh, Hell.
It’s not so bad if you don’t look down.
Don't worry...think of Walt Whitman...
I feel so . . . . penultimate.
I knew we would fall apart.
Man, I hate to leave you hanging like this, but I gotta hit the road.
Hang in there
I waited until we were alone to let you know I'm falling for you.
I thought you said jump on three?
I'm the answer blowing in the wind.
Serves me right for going out on a limb.
You say you’ve changed, but you refuse to let go.
I guess you win.
So much for going out on a limb.
You’ve always had such a hard time letting go...
Leaf's a bitch, then you fly.
I think they know something we don't because not one of them came back. I am going, too!
Goodbye, I'm leafing you.
As I promised, I'm turning over a new leaf.
Oboy! Finally I might get a chance to find out what that great smelling stuff is that they're burning!!!
I’m taking my Autumn leave.
This is just too mulch!
My favorite song? Blowing in the wind.
Well, it was fun hangin’ out with you while it lasted. Maybe I’ll see you after the fall?
I'm telling you Ted, this is more than a re-org.
Oh my God Simon, we're late, this is so embarrassing!
I'm sorry—you've changed."
It's why they call it "fall," silly.
You've always been a little clingy.
Next to pumpkin spice, this is what I hate most about autumn.
I'm falling and I can't get up.
I'll meet you in the drain pipe.
Nope. Wrong. Falling is worse than the fear of falling.
There’s a downside to being colorful and deciduous.
Is this why we're called "leaves"?
Let go ... it's the only way out of this cartoon.
Tell the saplings I love them!
I guess that makes you the branch manager!
Just let go. It’s the reason they call us leaves.
I think a spot just opened in that rain gutter!
And now, for the ride of a lifetime!
Nope, didn't hurt a bit.
I should have taken that coniferous offer.
I'll let the others know you'll be down soon.
I had a great Summer and I think I'm..I'm falling for you!
Look before you leaf.
I gotta leave
I told you I was older.
Don’t forget to feed the squirrel.
And stay for the winter? No thanks.
It’s not the falling that scares me; it’s the piling and jumping.
I'm going - I think we're more than fashionably late.
Let’s call it what it was — a spring fling.
Yeah, but one good gust of wind and they will only see you as mulch.
He comes! The Grim Raker!
My time has come.  If the rake doesn't get me, the leaf blower will.
You were supposed to jump too, Susan!!
I never got your name. "
...and don't forget to drift by my window.
Please, no puns.
Quick, what was that Sinatra tune about this?
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I’ll never let go.
I always meant to tell you, you are one in a million!
I guess we aren't buds anymore.
We'll always have June
'The Last Leaf of Autumn' -- they'll write poems about you, Sally!
The end of summer kills me.
Don't be upset... I've finally learned to let go.
Hang on, bro, you are the last on the family tree.
Farewell my friend, I’m leafing you.
What is that saying, 'Pride goes before the fall'?
Don't think about the blower. Live in the moment.
We'll meet at the drop point.
It's not dying I'm afraid of, it's the fall.
Don't deny your deciduousness!
FALL - I get it now!
Sorry, I fell for a young rake.
Oh no! I finally get why it's called fall.
Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate, as we voyage along--oh, crap!
I did not see this coming.
Quick, turn over a new leaf!
Don’t fear the Raker.
I need to be more grounded.
Perhaps we'll meet later in Compost!
I know it's called the Fall,
I just hate when I hit the ground
That’s why they call it Fall.
It looks like I'm really falling for you.
See ya Saturday at the bonfire.
Is it because I didn't publish?
Be not afraid! There's a no burn ordinance in this town.
We’ll meet again after our decomposition.
Anything but the composter!
Well, I've just become one more statistic.
Just let go; the Fall is inevitable
DON’T LEAF ME TO DIE!!!
Try meditation – it helps you let go.
Text me from the compost pile.
We never got to have that treesome.
From now on, I'm going to stop looking down on others.
This is the last time I fall for you!
I think this is going to be a season -ending injury..
Come by, I'm just off Oak.
They should be glad we're not pigeons.
Sentience is a curse.
...the fall is only half of it...
I'll see you in the afterleaf.
Anonymity, even in death.
I'm not like the other's ....wait!
Capturing carbon is what we do so stop complaining.
I’m having that dream where I’m falling again, Doc.
It's so unfair. We spend every every daylight hour photo-syntheising and then they turn off the sap and let us go.
YOU, are Perennially wrong again!
‘What’s our Netflix password?’ Seriously?
We'll meet again in Hefty."
resistance is futile
Don't leave me! I can change!
Let's get down and dirty
See you on the burn pile.
Good thing we're not pumpkins.
A farewell to limbs.
skydiving was NOT on my bucket list!
I’m going to soil myself!
I swear I'm falling for you!
You never could let things go.
Its why they call it "fall."
You'll be okay. Just don't look down.
It's a promotion... I going to another branch..
Oh, the deciduousness!
Well, I'm not like you Shirley. I happen to like going with the crowd.
Don’t be sad for me. Just remember the fun we had when we were both green.
Go ahead! Hang around all winter and see if anyone cares.”
I'm being transferred to the new branch.
Little did I know, when I announced it was Fall, that leaves are so literal.
Wow, this really is the autumn of our lives.
If you meet me in the downspout, we'll be together forever and ever!
Nobody likes you, Robert.
And I'm not coming back!
Oh, now I get why they call it 'fall.'
Gutter or composter—not much in the way of life choices, eh?
Come on! It's all the rage among the vox pop.
Try not to get mulched!
We’ll always have spring.
All the good spots seem to be taken earlier and earlier each year.
Let go now Lucy and come with me. Let us leave this phony suburb.
I always knew you would leave.
Hey, this gravity thing is a lot more exciting than doing the wind tickle all day long.
Just our luck
If we were pine needles we wouldn’t have to go thru this every year
Maybe I'll get reincarnated as a Starbucks holiday cup and live a short, beautiful, capitalist life.
When I said  I was falling for you--this is not what I had in mind
Now I know why they call it Fall.
Promise me one thing... you'll delete my google search history
Yes, Mom, if Larry and Bob and Angie and Fred and Martha all jumped off a limb, I WOULD jump off too.
I regret everything!
Just when I’m falling for you.
I need some down time.
I'm' not just another leaf to be raked; 
I'm a critical datapoint in an afternoon of lawn care.
I think we should see other foliage.
I'm sorry, I have to leaf now.
This is why we call it 'fall', Tim.
I guess I’m for impeachment after all.
New Yorker cartoons in color? I'm outta here!
My work is done here.
I always thought that this is something that happened to other people.
Goodbye, Pam! I just can't stand being peeped anymore.
May you be memorialized in a child's art project and not cast into flames!
Genetic engineering gave us faces, but the aardvark overlords forgot to stop autumn. It will take a while for me to flutter to the ground, so let me spend my last seconds explaining what's wrong with you. . . . . . . . . .  Burp! I'm Larry the Leaf!
Sorry bro, I have to leaf now.
Leaving you alone was not my intent.
My Uber's here.
Been fun hangin’ with ya!
Everyone else is already at the mulching festival.
I'm leaving, Karen. We just don't photosynthesize anymore.
You’re acting Branch Manager now!
Dang.  That's 5 bucks I owe you.
Oops. I set my clock forward.
I agree that "autumn" is more poetic, but "fall" better expresses my feelings right now.
Uh oh, looks like all the good spots are taken.
See you in the afterleaf.
Hang on!  You're the only thing holding back winter!
It's over. You'll never change."
I think I’m part of some New England poem.
I'll see you at the bonfire tonight!
If we're lucky we might end up together pressed on the same page."
What's a lemming?
Don’t worry, I’ll pick a nice spot where we can decompose together.
I'm done. Seven months together, and you still say you just want to keep hanging out.
Hang in there, Mr. President! 
They can't get us all!
It’s been great hanging with you!
It's not the wind that kills you, it's the fall.
After all I did for this tree and this is what I get?
Yes, everyone's doing it.  But I don't think it's a fad.
Sorry, love -- I just can't hang around any longer...
You always were the strong one.
Text me when you land.
If I had known global warming was fake news I wouldn't have promised to stay with you forever
This tree just no longer sparks joy in me so I had to let it go
I never should have given up sugar.
It’s just a leaf of absence!
I'll try to save you a spot.
Well, I hate to leave you like this, but I have to hit the road now
Sorry to leave, my dear, but I have always preferred the rakish type.
I'm sorry, but Alright is not the best song of the decade. Hell, pick Despacito for all I care, the point is it's not even catchy, and I can say that and not be racist because I am in fact a leaf...
I hope we don't have to wait too long before we're together again in the compost heap.
Hoping to get some hot views as I drift by the windows.
I’ll be the fall guy !
Eventually, everyone leaves.
You’ve got this. You’ve been preparing for this moment your whole leaf.
Been nice working with you.  We'll have to do mulch sometime.
I've always hoped for a dramatic exit!
I sure am tired of being the fall guy.
To answer your question, yes, if everyone jumped off a bridge, I'd probably do it too.
this is not what I meant when I said we are drifting apart
Falling isn't bad, it's being raked and bagged that I hate!
We're all getting together in the rainspout!
Because everyone else is doing it, that's why.
I’m leaving now! Hang in there!
Remember, my Advanced Directive states, No Cremation.
Clear my internet history!
I wish we could have grown cold together.
Shit
If I can contact you from the other side, I’ll let you know what it’s like
This is terrible! I was never part of those huddled masses yearning to be free.
How come we're always being the last ones to leave a party?
Yes, the Trump/Turkey thing was the final twig for me.
Well, there goes the family tree.
I know we’ve only been together a few months, but I think I’m falling for you!
This view never blew me away.
Farewell! I'm gone with the wind!_Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
So much for stem-cell therapy.
... and remember: great colors come at great cost.
Let’s discuss our relationship again, after we’re more grounded.
Remember, I want to be mulched, not raked.
Looks like you're the Last Leaf Standing ... enjoy that final toast for us!
Remember me in my salad days.
It’s not the fall I’m afraid of, it’s the indignity of the rake.
It's all over, Edgar, I'm leaving, I need my freedom, don't try to follow me.  You can keep the tree.
I slept with Ted..."
So much for the stem cell therapy.
Stay gold.
I don’t mind the fall.  It’s the mower I hate!”
I hate that we only get to see family at funerals.
I already regret my decision
Now I get it. Make like a tree and LEAVE.
Well, I'm off.
We're going to be part of a classic short story!
They're tearing us limb from limb!
Now I slip the surly bonds of tree and kiss the face of mulch.
Oh, God, I think I'm having an existential crisis!
Wait! Old Yeller is gonna be okay, right?!
Remember 3 weeks ago when I was green with envy?
Quick, take a leafie.
Composting is too yukky for me. I am hoping for cremation.
Of all the oak trees in all the towns in all the world, we grew on ours, and we'll always have our summer.
I ate your chocolate squirrel!
Try to drift to the lawn across the street...they don't mulch!
That’s why it’s called “Fall.”
Well...I never did like the view.
Thanks for voting me off the tree.
It's gonna be a long fall.
It's not so much the fall as it is the landing."
Let's meet for mulch later
It’s not you, it’s the wind.
I need a break. You’ve changed.
I was going to leave anyway--too many nuts up here.
I'll try to keep my mind out of the gutter.
Don't worry - it's not the fall that kills you.
aim for the car,they're heading south!
I’ll meet you once you leave. We’ll do mulch.
Be strong...you are the last-leaf standing!!!
Have you ever read that short story by O'Henry?
I’m feeling a strong sense of detachment.
Aim for the windshield!
Think you won?  Just remember 'One is the loneliest number,' Jerome. 'One is the loneliest number.'
Summer's over. Back to earth.
For God's sake Stanley, quit being such a procrastinator! Everyone else already selected the best lawn seats.
I’m done, the peepers are creeping me out.
It is your time on the executive branch now.
Trippin' on chlorophyl always ends badly. Sorry, Babe.
Ask yourself: Am I ready to meet my raker?
I’m turning a new leaf, branching out and falling without a net. I’ve never felt more alive.
I'm sorry to leave, but I must return to my roots.
Oh, snap, Jack! I don't think I'll be back...
Ha. Look at those losers down theeeeerrre.
Just let go Marge it’ll be piles of fun!
This is what a low budget version of "Gone with the Wind" looks like.
See what happens if you stay in the sun too long?
Are you waiting for a golden parachute?
It’s not the fall but the raking that scares me.
Quick, toss me my car keys.
When you hear people remark on that satisfying crunch underfoot in autumn, remember me..
Close your mouth. Do you know how dirty that driveway is?
I've opted for burial over cremation
It is better to have leafed and lost, than to never have leaved before
Maybe I’m a little bitter, but isn’t calling it ‘Fall’ kind of rubbing it in?
Don't feel proud.  He who falls last, still falls.
Can I use you as a reference?!
I've always been more of a floater
I'll take the fall for this one.
Can you grab my charger?
Deaths? Think of the fallings as leaves of absence.
Gesundheiiiiiiiiiit!
The Answer, My Friend, Is Blowin' In The Wind.
That’s not a sidewalk, it’s a cemetery!
Sorry hon, gotta fly.
It's ok. Being good at photosynthesis didn't bring me the satisfaction I was hoping for.
Call it peer pressure if you like.  I've hung on for as long as I can.
I'm leaving you for a rake.
Don't let go Rose, don't ever let go!
You do realize how predictable our caption will be, don’t you?
I've never been good with peer pressure.
The answer is blowing in the wind, but what was the question?
Don't tell me to get my mind out of the gutter.
The acorn isn't yours!
The time has come," the leaf they said, "to talk of many things. Of children jumping into piles, and carolers who sing. And because we'll have no winter, I'll see you in the spring!
You said you’d fall first!
I'm afraid I'm falling for you.
Drop Dead
I always though I’d be the last to go
Just remember........'the last shall be first.'
I wish we could stick together, I'm really falling for you.
I just figured it all out. What we call the universe is actually...
Oh wait, did you say 'leaf' or 'leave'?
Fall is the cruelest season.
You have a great future in mulch if you can stay out of the gutter.
Ok, yes, I admit to a sense of existential futility.
Get with the times.
But everyone’s going to Burning Leaf this year.
Well, you're the one that wanted to be the branch manager!"
If Ever I Would Leave You....
I hate being the fall guy.
You do this every year, man.
Bye Fe-LEAF-cia
Tag. You're it.
See you later for mulch.
Whatever you do, don’t look down.
I always thought you'd be the first to go.
I don't care if it is what nature intended.
You don't really love me, but you keep me hanging on.
I want to branch out
Tell the squirrel that I’ll wait for her.
How come I'm the fall guy.
Don’t land on your stem!
Oh my, I underestimated the gravity of the situation!
Don’t be so clingy.
My chlorophyll is about to chlorofall.
Sorry, but it's time I leave.
Call Me!
I knew there was a reason I liked the word "autumn" better
There was enough room on the branch, Rose.
Banzaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!
Oh well,we can't hang around here forever.
My therapist can help you with your separation anxiety.
Even when we first got together, you always said I'd be the first to leave.
I promise that soon I'll be more grounded
What happened to "go on three?"
It's not you, it's fall.
Our branch is dropping us.
But I'm not ready to leave!
We've both changed Alan.
In my dreams, I always pictured myself as old and gray at the end.
I always assumed you’d go first.
If all your friends jumped off a bridge would you?
We agreed this wasn't a long term thing.
You really blow me away.
I knew you'd fall for me!
Crap I forgot my phone charger!
Hoping to come back as a redhead next time.
Tell them I want to be cremated.
Goodbye!  Pray we end up in the same compost bin.
It was nice while it lasted.
I don't look forward to the Fall
If the fall doesn't kill ya, the rake will.
You comin' or are ya just gonna hang around for a bit.
Don't worry. We have so mulch to look forward to!
I don't like this very mulch.
I changed my mind, I don't want to go wherever the wind takes me!
I knew the color thing was too good to be true.
Maybe I’m being paranoid, but I feel like I’m just one more in a pile of guys that have fallen for you.
Oh no!
And we were so close.
Why aren't you falling for me?
Well, you have to admit it is time to leave.
Help!  I can’t feel my trunk!
Our May to November relationship hung on longer than most.
But in L.A., you'd miss the seasons.
... and just when I was about to peak!
I'll see you on the other side . . . walk.
Bruce Willis was actually dead the whole tiiiiiiiiime...
We had a pact!
Heads or tails?
Come on, I'll break your fall.
I told you we'd all be leaving soon!
I'll say it again, leaf blowers should be banned!
I see a bright light.
Never forget, I love you very mulch...
Time for me to 'leaf.' Get it? I've been waiting my whole life to make that joke.
It's not anyone's fault. I just think we've started drifting away from each other.
It's not you, it's the season.
Dare I say, you blew me away!
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the —.
You can't just blow me off like that, we're family!
Damn.  I forget the words to Amazing Grace.
I slept with Susan!
I’ll be fine! Street sweeping isn’t until Friday.
...And they make so much fuss about global warming!
Yes, Mother! I'm doing it because all my friends did it! OK!?
See you in the garbage bag.
I always hoped that I would be the first to go.
I'm so tired of well meaning  friend  telling me to just"hang in there" !
Hey, so anyway, let's blow down the street together sometime uh next week?
Well, I guess I'm out of a job!
Don’t look down!
Just be glad we lasted until our full retirement age.
Stop crying. We weren't that close.
I told you climate change was real!
I now understand the irony of being named Russel.
Finally, my casting call for "Mulch Ado About Nothing."
Sorry, I'm just not the clingy type, John.
I'm sorry, I fell for someone else!
You know, we`re many colors but we`re really all the same.
Why is it that you are always the last to leaf the party ?
Okay! Okay!
You win!
I'd have liked to stick around, but the branch office let me go.
Maybe we’ll meet again on the same rake
And yes, "Blowin' in the Wind" is still my favorite song!
I was going to go yelling and screaming, but now I think fluttering is good enough.
Apologies. I was wrong about what deciduous meant.
It was nice hanging with you.
This whole season I have had attachment issues.
It was a honor opening the new branch with you.
We do this all the time. Get over it.
I broke it off too soon.  Now I realize I'm falling for you.
Don’t be a snob. Get down to earth.
If I leaf you will you still luff me?
And please make sure my obituary uses gender neutral pronouns.
I always hoped that you would go first.
Orange isn't your natural color!?
Remember, all leaves matter.
I always dreamed of us going together.
At least you can enjoy that alone time you always wanted...
Hang in there, the odds of surviving winter are actually greater than the odds of having your caption selected.
To be honest, I always thought you'd go first.
Ohhh so that's why they call us "leaves"
I'm not taking the fall for you.
I always knew branching out was a bad idea
But you said you’d never leave
It’s the fall that kills you
Hurry!! Make a wish!
It's been an honor to serve you, Mr President
Well, you said leave me alone, hope you’re happy now.
I always thought you'd be the one to leaf.
Gee, I hate to leave you hanging.
I thought if I called it "autumn," I wouldn't fall.
I thought you said on 'Go' !?
My leaf is flashing before my eyes.
Uh oh. Crunch time.
If you're not changing, I'm leaving!
There's really no point in holding on.
Find me.
You stupid fool. The fall'll probably kill you!
If we play it smart and the wind cooperates,we can meet again in the compost bin.
And they say only fools get leaf insurance.
I’ll never leaf you.
Looks like you win the office pool
At least I held on longer than de Blasio.
I love getting blown."
Now I‘m free, free fallin’!
Now I'm going to drift by his window.
You remember that famous scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid...?
I still don't know why they call it "autumn"
I’ll always remember our photosynthesis
I don't care what they say—Vermont sucks.
I'll be retiring to the garage behind the lawnmower.
Follow my podcast:  "The Rake's Progress".
So I voted for the Green New Deal. What did it get me? Same old, same old.
I pictured retirement differently.
My Uber has arrived at last.
C'mon Jim, why do you think they call it  'fall'
But if I'd ever leave you,
It couldn't be in autummmmmmnnnnnnn...
I'll see you in the compost pile.
Wait! Will they really let me feed the worms?
I'll meet you on the sidewalk.
Mark my words, Leif, it will happen to you too.
Remember when we thought it wasn't easy being green?
I’ll meet you on the other sidewalk.
Sorry Carl, I've changed and you haven't.
Tell the world my story.
I am aiming to land next to that sweet ginger maple from next door.
Make sure you unplug the iron before you leave!
You're one pig-headed leaf and I'll always respect you for it.
I think the popular choice just got easier with time.
A lot of friends head south in winter, 
but I need more culture.
You had all summer to think about this moment and the best you could come up with is that old cliche, 'Into each leaf a little fall must reign?'"
You win.  The tree does like you best.
It's been great changing color with you.
Our Uber is here!
I know I said I would fall for you, but it’s time that I leaf. I hope you understand Autumn.
I told you not to sing "Autumn in New York!"
That’s why they call it fallllll......
Come on, you always wanted to get a ground's-eye view.
Love me or leaf me
I'll miss you, but I've always wondered about out-of-tree experiences.
I'm Fallin' 'fore you; leaf with me!
Hit pause so I don't miss the ending!
I hope you can hang on until spring.
Come on, I hate travelling alone.
It's my time to take a leaf of absence."
Every Fall it's the same temulchuous ending.
I'm falling for you."
But Mom, all the cool leaves are doing it!
The worst aspect of growing old is seeing all your friends die before you.
The answer isn't staying on the tree branch.
Well, you only leaf once!"
I'll share my location on WhatsApp!
Bye, Marvin, see you in the Mulch.
Wait, I said I was going to let YOU go.
Ars longa, vita brevis. See ya!
Hit the ground running...seriously?
That’s the last time I go out on a limb for you!
Resist!
I just hope the dog doesn't shit on me."
I know everybody's doing it; I just don't see the point.
But I was only one day from retirement!
It's not the fall that gets me, it's the separation anxiety.
Here goes the long-anticipated float into nothingness.
You said I was different. That we'd leave together. Then you just blow me off like the rest of them.
Sometimes, you just gotta let go.
Last one down is it!
‘I’m not scared to die,I’m scared of going to Mulch.’
Well, at least now I can testify before congress.
Well, this is where I leaf you.
Dude.....It’s your breath. And it’s not just me.
I'll meet you in the mulch pile at midnight!
I only hope I don't wind up part of some kid's art project.
Keep it up!
I guess that 'fake news' about season change was right after all...
Go ahead and free fall," they said. "It would be fun", they said
Come on...all the cool leaves are doing it!
I thought we agreed: “When you jump, I jump!”
Turn on my out-of-office reply!
I'm returning to my roots
Alone at last!
I guess I was wrong all along about how photosynthesis would render us indispensable.
Next time say autumn, not fall!
Look me up when you get to the compost pile!
Dammit, Bob. You said 'on 'three'.
To sleep, perchance to dream...
Now to test my theory of flight.
Dang, hold on until the guy rakes.
If I don't see you we're having a big gathering later tonight.
Oh no...... is one ever ready?
You're the one who wanted to move to a place with seasons!
We're all getting together later, if you can make it.
I'm moving out.
She leaves me.  She leaves me not
He who leafs last...lasts longest.
I'm hanging on to see how the Trump saga plays out.
Stop singing "I'll  see you in September".
To everything there is a season.
I'm blown away........
I'm telling you, if you want to be in the leaf pile, you've got to get in on the ground floor.
I'll meet you at the car!
If the planet is still here, I'll see you in springtime
Nobody wants you when you're old and brown.
The horror! We Oak Leaves falling on Maple Street!
Now that I'm in the middle of it, I vote for 'Autumn' over 'Fall'....
I don't care if we have roots in New England... I told you in the spring we should have gone to Florida!
Is "left" the past tense of "leaf"?
I'll save a spot for you.
What happen to our quid pro quoooooo?
I’ll save a spot for you in the bag.
Remember: I want to be cremated!
I don't adapt well to change.
Hey! It's only seasonal  work. Watch out for ICE!
Watch how I do it. The trick is to turn over a new leaf.
Ohhhhhhh that's why they call it Fall
I still say climate change is a hoooaaax!
You said you'd fall for me too!
I told you so
But pumpkin spice lattes aren't even on sale yet!
Aren’t we beautiful this time of year?
OK! I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
So much has changed—I just can’t stay any longer.
God, I hate fall.
I can't believe how easily I fell for you!
You win!
A leaf; a wind; a suddenly opened door.
Avenge me!
You won ..... see you in the compost ....!
Guess I’m leaving
Like all my family I want to.be cremated.
I hate to leave you like this.
What happened to the suicide pact?
Fall? I thought it was autumn!
Caterpillars in spring, desiccation in fall... I quit.
I'm giving in to peer pressure.
Hurry up! You don't want to be left behind.
I’m oaky, tawny, well-aged, and ready to be laid down.
I guess this is what happens when you go out on a limb.
Guess you'll be the last to leave!
Oh my God, I'm coming
I guess that leafs just one of us.
Oh how I hate to see October go
Hang tough!
It's me, not you..
If you leaf now you can beat the rush.
For the record, I'm succumbing to the gravity--not the peer pressure.
That's not what I meant by "branching out".
See, calling it Autumn doesn't make a damn difference!
I am falling and I won't be able to get up!
I hate to leave you hanging...
I knew I'd end up being the fall guy for you!
We had a wonderful summer, Roger. But we've both changed.
There's no beating around the bush: I'm falling for someone else.
Yeah, but then they'd call us "stays."
I hate it when winter comes early
But I don't want to leave!
Holy s***, we’re in color!
This is why I prefer “autumn.”
It's going to be a long Fall.
We were the perfect couple!
I'm not going anywhere.  Season change is fake news!
I always take the fall for you.
Why are we always the last to leave?
Sometimes you just want to curl up and die.
Well, all summer you said I should be more grounded.
I was told it's so much fun down there I'll be blown away
This has nothing to do with global warming.
Damn liberals!
See, I'm right and you're still left.
Remember when we used to do this in October instead of the week before Christmas?
I'm sorry to leaf you behind. I never expected to fall for you.
Help!  I’m falling and I’ll get swept up.
Oh, and I quit my job today. Okay bye!
You’re turning into someone I don’t recognize.
Hang in there, Freddy.
When they said fall was coming i didn’t know this is what they meant.
Hold on to your dreams, my friend.
I swear it's not you, it's just my nature!
We'll always have September.
If only humans looked this good when they were dying.
My abandonment issues start now."
You've changed.
I could use a hand here.
Street cleaning is today so it was great knowing you.
You're oak. I'm oak.
I always knew it would end like this.
Sorry Stan, but I'm leaving you.
And you said you would never leaf me...
I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I just hope they don't have a mulching mower!
I know I promised to never leave you. Ahhhh!
Time to make like a tree...
Here's where I take my leave.
In our next life, I promise to fall for you again.
Just because everyone else is doing it...
Can so many of us have been so proud?
Always wondered why they call it fall.
I’LL DROP BY LATER
You promised not to leave me hanging!
I'm falling for you, Jim!
Hang in there. Don't Give in..Make us Prooouuudd!!
You really are one in a zillion.
Sorry to leaf you, catch you mulch later!
It’s never been my intention to leaf you!
Float like a butterfly, swing from the tree.
You jinxed it! It's called Autumn, Chuck.... Autumn
Its crunch time, been nice hanging with you.
They don’t call it “fall” for nothin’!
I never thought this could happen to me
I'll always remember us as buds!"
First they rake you into a pile.  Then they jump on you.  And then they light you on fire.  They call it election season.
You're really making me the fall guy?
I thought you were the down-to-earth one.
Enjoy your composting, I will
I"ll call you when I land.
I said ON three
I always worried I'd be the first to go.
Oh, I finally get the joke about how hard it is to leaf.
Dry humor has a lot going for it.
At least they don't rake here.
It's not you Gary, I'm just falling for someone else.
So this leaves only you.
Why are you  always late?
Looks like I’m the Fall guy.
Don't look so smug, Ethel.  The same fate awaits us all.
You'll know when it's your time.
Call it peer pressure if you want.
Are you coming back next year as an oak or ginkgo?
Goodbye my summer love, I'm falling for you all over again.
“Why did it have to be "The fall"?
Couldn't it be "The safe landing"?”
Stay strong, and don’t let’m see you sweat.
Can't you see I'm falling for you?
Deciduous sucks.
I'll fall for you soon
Have a pleasant flight
The same thing happened last year!
You said we'd do this together!
I'm going downstairs for coffee. Want anything?
Time to join the masses.
Here comes the Fall!
You just gotta learn to let go!
Well, I guess that leaves this matter up in the air.
Would it have killed you to call it Autumn just once?
Well, now we'll see if Nietzsche was right ...
You don't understand....I could have had class. I could have been a contender. I could have been somebody.....
Didn’t expect our branch to make such drastic cutbacks.
Next life I’m definitely a pine tree.
I'm going for a pumpkin spice latte. Do you want anything?
Guess I'm off to push up daisies.
It's ok, I always knew it would just be a summer fling.
Bob Dylan better be right.
It's a living!
Farewell my summer love
What do you mean you forgot the leaflets at school?!
You hang on! I'll take the fall!
My contribution to maple syrup, I’m taking the fall.
You said you’d jump on three.
I fell for you last year and we both got swept away
If the Ancient Stories are true, I'll see you in the Spring...
The Buddha says we should let go of our attachments, but I’m not readeeeeeeee...!
Please don’t leaf me alone up here
I hope we are in the same mulch pile!
Goodby Grace.
I’ve finally been cleared for landing!
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
I told you we’re deciduous.
I'll see you in the After Pile.
One more time, it's spring forward, fall back, right?
You gotta learn to let go, Larry
Why is everyone leaving?
I'm just blown away by you!
Ah! I snapped!
I should have listened to you and practiced meditation.
Let's hang out again! Same time, next year?
Let's leave. There's always a good crowd at the Maples.
I always knew that I'd fall for you
Just talk to the tree.
Oh dear, ‘Ring Around the Rosie just got a lot more extreme!
It’s not about you. I just need to branch out.
If I don't see you, have a great winter.
My friends warned me that you were too clingy.
Sorry, but someone has to be dead last.
Don't say: "don't leave me!"
I thought we would leave together
Chaos theory, it's the Monarchs fault.
I told you it's just a seasonal affair!
Goodbye friend!  I'm off to either a compost pile or a garbage dump.
It’s not just dogs who go to heaven, right...?
Louis, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship
Stop trembling like a leaf and jump!
Everyone else on our family tree has scattered.
I always hated youuuuuu!
I told you we should have been Leaves of Grass!"
I just tired of hanging around.
But most of all, I'm sorry that I'll miss the impeachment.
Just because they all do it doesn't mean you have to.
Then just think of it as "autumn."
I tried to hang on but the taxes are killing me here...
Remember, my love, you can't spell DECIDUOUS without US...
Look, if I commit now, I have a really good shot at getting into some really top Ivy League compost.
Nooo, don’t leave me !
I’m out of here.  I refuse to be last.
I think I'm falling for you, Frank..but must you be so clingy?
Global warming is a hooooax!
Find me on Facebook!
If they wanted you to stay they would have called it 'stay' not 'Fall'.
So.....are you falling for me?
You always think it only happens to others.
I held on for you for as long as I could
I hate moving
Who’re you calling a lightweight?
We're all just fall guys.
Hope to see you next fall.
Stop! Don't leaf me behind!
What do you mean I’m a lemming?
Don’t forget to shut off the water.
This weather always blows me away.
The family tree is getting a little sparse.
I’m more scared of being forgotten.
Finally, retirement!
Don’t worry I do this every year
Oh man, I knew I should have moisturized!
I'm taking a leaf of faith!
You didn't say if you preferred to be mulched or bagged?
I'll never call you too clingy again!
I think I’m starting to fall for you...
Don’t you know that’s why they call it Fall
I'm falling for you, see you in the compost Stella
Pride cometh before the fall, Allen!
Sweetheart, I'm the fall guy.
No one will be able to call me 'clingy' now!
Gotta run. Death is trending.
Damn! I really wanted to see the impeachment.
'Well, goodbye, I knew it was only a summer fling...'
I've always been partial to Errol Garner's version too.
Don’t leaf me.  I was just about to fall for you.
Don't worry.  I'll send a text with my GPS coordinates.
I'm afraid I'll be leaving now....
Nooooo, I don't want to diiiiie
Look away, I’m orange!
Look for me at Second and Main.
It's time we broke up.
Well, that lemming's TED talk made it sound like fun.
I leaf you... get it? I leaf you.
I'm leaving while I still can.
I never thought this would only be a summer romance!
It seemed so normal for the others -- why is it so scary for me?
You just can't let it go, can you?  Well fine, stick around, I'm leaving!
Sadly,this one falling out ends our summer romance.
Everybody else is doing it!
Look for me on oak street.
Wish me luck at the Forrest Gump audition!
I suppose I’ll have to take the fall for this one...
So what am I, your Fall guy?
I will always be-leaf in you!
Take care of our mother.
I can’t fly!!!
Orange you coming?
I thought we were evergreen!
Who saw this coming?
I always told you this relationship would just be a summer thing.
Sorry babe. It’s time to chill. I told you it was just a summer fling.
No, you keep the branch.  I’ll settle somewhere else.
Falling is such sweet sorrow.
I truly believed we were different.
Don`t leaf me alone!
It's the end of the fourth quarter and it looks like crunch time.
Don’t worry, I’ll save you a spot.
Don't worry - I'll save you a seat.
Wait! Do-over!
I'm off to join the decaying masses!
I need to know.  Were we something more than a quick spring.
Hang in there pal. You're the last leaf of the season.
No, you go first."  "No, you go first."  "No, you go first.
I told you to call it autumn!
Are you kidding me? That's why they call it Fallll.
I never saw Paris.
Marco!
This part of the 'Circle of Life' is so unseemly.
Why do you always have to be the last to leave?
Pine all you want, but we'll always be deciduous.
Bottom of the tree means top of the pile!
Ohhh, NOW I know why they call it 'fall', duh!
I hope to decompose near you!
Sorry oki, but I'm the fall guy.
Well,let's hope those paraglider lessons pay off.
Take good care of the tree.
I’m being relocated to another branch
It's not you, it's deciduous.
I'm gonna miss you so mulch.
... and then suddenly, Donald Trump was left all alone.
I think it’s time we decompose.
I really am falling for you !
I dream of covering dog poo for the final act.
I'm gonna get to the root of what's holding us up.
Well, there goes the neighborhood.
The ground comes for us all.
I told you it wasn't a good idea to branch out
What Happens After The Fall ?
Somehow I just knew this wouldn't last.
You need to stop hanging on when it's time to let go.
I just hope I'm spared the rake.
Oh come on. Join the crowd.
Winter, Spring, Summer and -FAAALL!
You picked a fine time to leave me.
Sorry, but I have to leaf you now.
Snowflakes ain't got nothin' on us.
Promise me you’ll wait...
I don't want to decompose.
So this is why they call us leaves.
There's no easy way down.
It's time to meet the grim raker
The landing's not bad, but I dread getting run over.
Hold on for your dear leaf!
I should have bought some carbon offsets!
Natural selection
I hate to leave you like this.... but nature calls....
The schools are just better down there - you’ll understand when you have kids
“ If ever I would leaf you, it wouldn’t be in Summer. . . .
I guess your on your own now.
Now you're the last leaf hanging.
It must be autumn because I'm falling for you.
Be sure your location status is turned on!!!
You must promise me that you'll survive. Never let go, Rose.
You're last, but not least!
I'll  try and  fall on the driver's side window wiper.
We were growing apart anyway.
Hope you have a nice fall!
Damn! Just once I'd like to go somewhere else for the winter.
I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee, where White Lightening is the biggest thrill of all.
Like I always say, “if you can’t beat em, join ‘em!”
Everyone always leaves me.
Sometimes, you just have to let go!
I'll say, Hi to mom and dad.
I hope next Fall we can go green.
Promise to look me up?
Rose, you said you'd never let go!
I hear it's the fall that kills you, not the fall.
I don't mind the fall so much, it's being stepped on when I'm down that scares me.
I am special.  I am unique.  There is nobdy quite like me.
I'm leafing you now, but will see you in the fall
Love the view from here but this neighbourhood's getting too pricey for me.
Just face it we all end up in the gutter sooner or later.
So sorry; I didn't know this wasn't a good hang out place.
Let’s meet under the tree.
Good luck Steve. You can do this. Hang in there.
I can't hide it any longer...I've fallen for you.
Let it go.
I'd love to hang out, but I'm officially grounded until next year.
Last one on is a rotten egg.
That’s it.  I’m leaving you.
The oak's on you!
Remember when I told you that the road to non-conformity could only lead to loneliness.
You’re next!
Tell my twig and acorns I love them!
It's all downhill from here.
I hope I'm not falling for some rake.
Remember my name!  I'm Leaf, Eric's son
Enjoy your victory while you can - your downfall is inevitable.
The Grim Raker is calling meeeeeee.
Why am I always the first to fall?
Please don’t get remarried.
Look for me at the landfill.
But what if air resistance DOESN'T put a force on me?!
I feel like one of the president's men.
We'll finish the conversation later
‘They let a few of us hang around for the winter. Better than the options.’
When I said I'd fallen for you, this isn't what I meant.
I told you not to cough.
Don’t forget, everyone’s getting together for the big blowout this weekend.
I can't stay out on a limb with you; I need to branch out
Sorry I snapped!
Well, my therapist suggested that I move out of my comfort zone...
It not you, it’s me...but I have to leaf.
I hate existentialism.
But I was so sure that I was in the 1%!
Now you’ll have to bear the survivors’ guilt alone!
Have a beautiful fall.
Well, I’m off to the south for the winter. You coming?
Well, I really let myself get carried away this time.
I've never seen Titanic!
Uh oh, I think I’m about to leaf you.
Look for me on a hipsters Instagram page above an edgy caption about death.
I've decided to branch out - I'll see you after the fall.
Come on, why do you think they call it Fall?
Sorry to be leafing you alone.
I hate leaving at rush hour.
Hang in there...we can do this!
You know what they say, "make like a tree and leaf"...
We can't hang forever
Watch! I'll demonstrate when to pull the cord.
You ever have that dream where you're FAaaaallllinnng?
You will need to branch out alone.
What!?  She 's dating the MAPLE leaf?!  I'm completely blown away!
Some say there’s an afterleaf
If I'm not back in an hour...just leave
The blower is your friend, but beware the rake.
Okay, watch this! I've been practicing the Triple Lindy in my mind all summer!
I've seen your true colors. I'm leaving!
It’s okay—they banned plastic bags.
I'll be LEAVING you..... sounds like the beginning of a song"
Come on, everyone is doing it!
As a matter of fact, it WAS something you said.
Gesundheit!
What's the point in hanging on?
You win the bet.
We'll always have Vermont.
I knew there'd be a downside to hanging out with you all summer!
If you're deciduous, I'm deciduous.
I’m just going out for some cigarettes.
Dying is easy! Comedy is hard!
I went out on a limb for you
You're so stubborn.
No hell below us, right?
Are you coming with me or not?
May fate rake us together again.
Please delete my browsing history!
I blame the flu vaccine.
I'm feeling a little bit more than separation anxiety!
The fall is coming.
I never learned how to fly!
Oh well...
It never gets any easier to leaf you.
Leaves come and go but I thought you were different!
When you turned, I started falling for someone else.
It's ok to let go.
I’m pretty positive this is not covered by my insurance!
Last fall I landed in a river, exciting 2 weeks traveling to the Gulf.
It's been great photosynthesizing with you.
s
I can't stop shaking.
Finally Freedom
OH-MY-GOD! Not a Volvo!
See you next year, bud.
I guess this is why they call it “fall”.
I wish I'd traveled more!
Say Hello to Mom.
I'm off to join our trashy neighbors.
Gotta go. I've been subpoenaed by Adam Schiff's committee.
Maybe I’ll catch you later. Depends on how the wind blows.
We knew last Spring it would eventually come to this.
Who am I to fight collectivism?
It was more than just hanging out together to me.
God, I hope I don't land by Todd.
Nature's equivalent of presidential primary season.
Nothing personal.
Get that stick out of your ass and join the rest of us
I'm sycamore of these falling leaves.
I gotta leave now!
Congratulations and good luck in November.
Rapture, Schmapture, aaaah, Lordy Lordy, I'm coming home!
Turn the stove off!
Que sera sera.
Cover me. I'm going in!
I'm afraid things are getting a little too deciduous.
I was going to suggest moving to Miami, but it may be little late
I had hoped to be a leader in this effort.
Hopefully, we'll meet again fertilizing tomatoes.
I'll se ya, down the road...
I'm not red-y yet! I'm just orange-y!
beats the hell out of hanging around with you...
I’m failing to see the humor here.
Is there life after mulch?
It's been great hangin' out with you!
Don’t you wish it was called “Rise”
Sorry to leave you, but I need to branch out.
“Don’t Cry; I’ll meet you at the leaf blower.”
We'll be together again on earth, Sally.
I'm going south for the winter
I'll see you on the ground.
Let’s go for a spin—meet me at the car
See you in the spring, bud.
The branches, my friend, are blowin' in the wind.
Let's keep up on Facebook!
I'm not really leaving you.  Consider it a grounding.
I hate long drawn out good byes... But we are the last ones up here...
or...
Last one down is a Monkeys Uncle...
Or... 
I was wrong to think our relationship would last forever...
See you in the compost bin.
Pumpkin spice is a sign of the end of days!
Love your optimism--hang in there, Ralph!
I'll miss you most of all, when Autumn leaves start to fall.
I'm just waiting for my Uber and then I'll be on my way!
You are always late for everything!
I love you, Marcia, but destiny calls.
It’s not you. It’s just that I want to be free to try other leaves.
What will it be: compost, eternal damnation, or burning in hell?
By By, Miss America pie.
Actually Frank, it IS you.
Ohhhhhh. And I only just broke even on collecting my pension.
Bye,Felicia.
I blame Trump!
It's going to be so boring down there...just lying around all day, doing nothing"
They say that fluttering is easy.
Don't forget to ask for Russell
I'm running down to the corner to get a paper. I'll be right back.
I know. I'm always the last to leaf.
I'm branching out, I'm hoping to become a Leaftenant."
Save me a place.
No, you first, I insist.
Don't be too upset - maybe we'll see each other down the road.
Hope we make it to the same leaf bag
Oh no! I’m having that recurring dream again.
Don't worry, kid, you can come back as mulch.
Well, I guess I'm heading down south for the winter.
It's a PANDEMIC!
Oh no! I'm trapped in an  O'Henry horror film!!!
I'll be back.
What does deciduous mean?
Can you compost a tweet for meeeeeee?!
Don't worry--I'll be the orange-ish, yellowish, reddish one.
What's falling is the property value on this street
At least I won’t have to listen to the next debate.
And hey—good luck with your fear of abandonment.
My leaf flashed before my eyes.
Rake News!
Global warming, my ass!
The answer, my friend isn’t blowin’ in the wind.
I'll meet you on the other side...of the fence.
I told you the mightiest fall first.
Personally, I don’t want to be up here for the winter.
Why didn’t we protest this when we had the chance?
It's just you now - please, tell the world our story.
When I land, Sam, the echo will tell you it’s safe to let go!
They call it "relief"
Is that the new Tesla?
See you in leaf-blower hell.
Is it too late to say, “I’m falling for you?”
Why so sad? All May-September romances
 must inevitably end.
Thus begins my downward spiral into the gutter.
I’m falling for you...really!
I don't care! All our friends are doing it.
I'll be the 127th leaf on your right!
I’ll wait for you on the ground floor.
I’ll meet you under the windshield wipers..
This is why I never like talking about politics at work, it makes me shake like a - oh here's my ride, see you tomorrow!
So long and thanks for the CO2.
Somehow, it’s just not a peak experience for me.
This is some seriously strong acid.
Just once I’d like to go to Palm Springs instead of heading south
Nothing gold can stay Paul....nothing gold can stay.
Darling, I’m falling for you
Let's pray fate rakes us together.
Option 1: Don't leave me!
Option 2: I don't care what the Dylan song says, there are no answers here!
You won't feel a thing
NOW you tell me "deciduous" means " falling off at maturity."
Remember, we’re better than lemmings!
First time? Just don’t walk towards the light and you’ll be back next spring.
Shall we?
Do you think the kids will find us?
Let's take off sweetheart .   Meet you on the hood!
I thought I’d be the last to leave.
Let’s meet up after this Fall.
Darn, it's still the playoffs -- is it CO2 or MLB?
I think I've lost it
Breaking up is so hard to do- particularly in our golden years!
You’re going to watch the season finale without me, aren’t you.
I'm leaving you and going off to mingle with other leaves.  Don't tell me you're surprised.
Hope I see you at the L Z.
I can’t hang around listening to you saying ‘Give him time” anymore.
I never got the chance to tell you about my summer.
If only I’d used more sunscreen.
I hope I don't land near Roger. I owe him money.
Quick, look up "penultimate".
I was waiting to leave once the kids left
We hung on as long as we could, now it's all up to you
Forget the gutters, aim for the car wipers.
I hear illegal aliens put us in bags and then the snowflakes come...
I’ll  leave quietly. I hope I don’t get bagged.
Sorry, I'm always the last to leave aren't I?" 

"Get home safe Larry."

"Same time next year though, right?"
I never thought draft would take me!
Don't forget, we had a prenuptial agreement.
I'm leaving you, Madge-- you're a terrible housekeeper.
On my way to the Edvard Munch exhibit.
We could be in Orlando right now but no, you wouldn’t even talk about it!
It's the fall that gets you.
Retirement party's on the lawn, don't be late.
Make like a tree?" I don't get it
Outwit, outplay, outlast. Ok you win.
It's OK.  I was not looking forward to 2020 anyways.
It's left to you to tell our story.
I'm not falling for it.
Geronimo!
Compost bin 147, look me up.
"We fall for this every year.
I’m not used to being blown this hard!
I'm falling and I'm afraid I won't be able to get up.
See you at the next gathering
Goodby my dear, hopefully we will be able to turn a new leaf.
It’s time for me to leave.
I hung on as long as I could!
Sorry, but now is the time for me to leaf...
What color is my parachute?
I know something that you don't.
Wiggle a little harder and we can go together.
It's too late to make up--I'm leafing!
I will love you until I hit the ground.
I'm leaving, you are on your own!
It's my time to make like autumn and leaf.
I think everyone is done with orange by now.
I want to be cremated, not composted.
I was tired of hanging out with you anyway.
I'm "leaving".  This makes you the new "branch manager."
I’m sorry I have to leaf you alone.
Help! I'm falling and  won't be able  to get back up.
Fall the season? I thought you meant the verb.
Abscission!
I  hate change
It's a long story -- I'll text you when I land!
I'll never forget last summer.
Tell the kids not to forget their brown roots!
Just when I'm falling for you, you tell me to leaf you alone.
I'm dropping in, Larry. No leaf left behind. Semper Fi.
Finally, what a releaf!
It's not you...it's tree.
Maybe you’ll inspire O'Henry.
Oh, THIS is the Bad Place!
This is just like that near death experience I was telling you about.
Mark my words, next gust and  down YOU go!!!!
See you aground!
But, you promised to let go at the same time so we could compost together!
Fare thee well my love.
I'll catch you on the flip-side!
I guess it's separate vacations.
You broke wind? Oh man!
This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
Stop being so dramatic, this happens every year.
We're always the last to leave._
I'll light on a leaf for you.
Wait, you said 1-2-3 together!
Come on baby, don't fear the raker!
Because of global warming, our departure is much earlier this year.
I love you, Pete! My life insurance password is 2gether@WaltWhitman!"
You can do it! Fall!
Don’t worry, I’ll meet you in the fall!
Are you too yellow to fall?
Darling, I'm sorry...I said I'd never leave you..
We fall and Margaret makes this all about herself.
Our branch always liked you best!
Nah, if I attend the bonfire I'm gonna get raked over the coals.
We're past the point of worrying.
See you in the gutter
We break up to rake up!
I think its time for me to leaf
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner...I'm falling for you....
i thought we were both going to jump!
We’ve both changed, but that’s no reason to split up..
I'm gonna try this rakey massage.
FfffffffffUCK!
You said fall was your favorite season!
Promise me now, and never let go of that promise. Never let go.
Mom always liked you best
I always hoped I'd be the first to go!
And now I take my leave.
I’ll be hanging out at the mulch.
I will find you!!!
Let’s try life in the gutter.
The zen master says that we should let go of attachments.
Let's leave together so that one of us is not left out on a limb alone.
You said you wanted alone time.  I'll leaf you alone.
Now watch carefully, you only get one chance at this.
I’m staying. I don’t love you that mulch.
This will be the last time I'll be turning over a new leaf.
Promise me you'll never leave.
Just follow me . . .
I thought we were jumping on three
It’s time to let go Fred
Gotta be driftin' along.
We're all gathering at Joe's Bar &Grill tonight. See you there Ralph".
"Oh Bill, I always thought you'd be the first to go!"
It was fun while we lasted.
Oh! I think i am falling for you.
Okay, okay. So I was a couple months off calling this a May-December relationship.
Ok fine you win
I always knew you would be the last to go.
I can’t feel my toes.
Let’s shoot the breeze,” you said
I'm going out for cigarettes, be right back.
Gotta leave now, but hey! Drop by!
Deciduous, not coniferous. S*** happens.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
I give up bro, what do I have in common with 3 hole punched paper and tea!
You are SO grounded, Mister!
Please stop saying, 'Make like a tree ...'
Guess I'll be leaving.
Will you water my plants?
We'll always have photosynthesis.
You're too clingy.
But the realtor told me this was an evergreen tree!
This is my only chance to beat Simone Biles
It's not you. It's me!
Now I’ll never write my novel!
Come on man , help me
As they say, 'til fall do us part.
Don't gimme any Bronte!
Just die.
Wait! We said on the count of threeeee..!
I know we’re supposed to practice “detachment,” but this seems risky.
Global warming kept me from showing you my true colors.
So....cold.....
Sorry to leave you Autumn but I'm falling for somebody else.
I told you, “never fall for strangers” but I’m fallin’ for you.
I’m falling for you. Orange you going to fall for me?
Seek out the Wreath Dwellers.
I fell for you first
I'm going going to come out and say it. I'm leaving you.
Let's find each other in the compost pile
Catch ya on the mulch pile.
It's time for me to branch out on my own
Come with me!
I’m leafing it to you.
Should I stay or should I go?
Remember, we're all going to meet in the neighbors yard after midnight!
Hang on, I’m getting a call.
My therapist says it will good for us to spend some time apart. I’ve become too dependent on you and the tree.
Ah and just like that, we’re a crinkle in time.
I'll text you when I land.
Oh no! I’m really falling for you!
Oh, I’ve fallen for you!
Okay,you win.
We'll meet again / Don't know where / Don't know when
Everyone leaves me eventually.
Sorry, I have to leaf you now
I've always wanted to be the penultimate something, and now I am!
It’s been nice hangin’ with you all these...er, THIS year.
Meet you again past the pearly rakes
Help, I've fallen and I can't get up!
I'm jumping because of you. Fuck you dad.
Eve thinks I'm a fig leaf.
Sorry to leaf, but your true colors have shown.
I need your answer right away
We were "Born to be Fall !"
It’s climate change!
Whoa! Looks like I gotta leave now
Oh snap! I knew I’d fall for you.
I will never let go Jack. I’ll never let go.
Goodbye!  I’ll see you on the ground.
Are leaf blowers dangerous?
I guess this means the divorce is final.
Deciduous means heartbreak.
My leave of absence just got approved.
I feel so vulnerable at this time of year.
I thought we had a deal!
I want you to know I have always been blown away by you.
I'm not falling for this shit again!
I wish you'd stop calling me rakish.
See ‘ya, wouldn’t what to be ‘ya.
Here's looking at you kid!
Same time next year?
But I'm a leader, not a follower.
Let’s try to meet up again at the bonfire.
It was only a summer romance, baby.
I hate following the crowd
I’m not deserting you. It’s just a seasonal affliction.
Even though I know from years' experience it's a soft landing, I still hate the moment that the tree unexpectedly lets go.
I got a bachelors degree and a masters for this?
Is it for every drop of rain  ... or leaf . .. same difference, right?
Dude... whatever you do, don’t look down
One last thing; I never liked your Tartiflette.
Remember, aim for the drain!
My mom always told me I was special and unique, like a snowflake.
It's the winds of change, George.
It's only a brief death.  Let go, my friend.
Think I'll do the backflip this year!
Now that you've blown me off, you will be stuck here all by yourself!
Oh,Henry, it looks like you’re the last leaf.
Ahh geez hun, I guess it’s you and me against the whirl!
Looks like you won the tontine.
Inevitable falling out
You’ll miss the Fall collection
Remember the plan!!!
You really know how to clear a room, Gary.
I guess it's time for me to leave.
Now I know why it’s called “Fall”.
What about our Prenup?
I knew one day he’d snap.
Hang in there.  You can do it!
I've hung on as long as I can for you.
Last one down's a rotten egg.
If you really love me then you will come find me down there
Looks like I won't be helping you move next Thursday! Good luck!
Oh no! I'm falling!
I’ve changed my mind.  Self awareness sucks.
Time to make like a human and base jump.
I'll miss our Taco Tuesdays!
I had a feeling this was coming.
Don’t leaf!
The others were right about you!
I’m very sorry, but I think I’m falling for someone else.
Damn re-incarnation!
I hope you know I'm falling for you.
Did you ever get the feeling that we're trapped in an O Henry story?
It's called life, Jerry, you're born, you photosynthesize your heart out all summer, and then you get mulched, whatever that is.
And then one day the pin oak leaf becomes a “pine” oak leaf....
I’d love to talk about politics, but I really need to be rotting plant matter for a while, so...
You're always the last to LEAVE!
I thought you would be the first to leave.
We did our part in saving the planet...job well done...see you next spring!!!
We always said this would only be a summer thing.
Why can't we be Evergreen and avoid this nonsense.
Breakups are never easy.
Our gig's up, bud. We're compost from here.
... she loves me not, ..
I thought I would live forever.
I'd say anywhere but the gutter!
Remember: It’s lonely at the top.
Hanging by a thread is worse than the fall said all the ex-cabinet members
'Not everyone is lucky enough to reach the gold level…'
Fall is about falling.
I hung on as long as I could but it’s clearly time to leave.
I'm leaving you, Janet. It's not just our colors that have changed.
Edith, I'm leaving.
At least we'll gain an hour.
Don’t be scared, just let go and fall.  It’s like running for president, everyone’s doing it.
I think I left the stove on
Hang on, kid.  You could be the inspiration for the next O. Henry.
Baby, you know I hate to leave!
Rent up here was just too darn high.
I’m sorry Carl, I just need some diversity in my life
I didn't want to leaf you this way.
Maybe be grounded will be a good thing...?
I always knew that someday you'd blow me off.
Need anything from Costco?
Seems like the thing to do.
Ahhh, NOW I know why they call it "Fall!"
I won't stick around. You've changed.
I told you it wouldn’t laaaast!
I told you, Jeffrey is not coming back to you.
I'm sorry I'm becoming so distant.
I know I said I wanted to 'get blown' but this is ridiculous!!!
Never let go, Rose.  I promise, Jack.
Guess that's why the call it Fall.
Selfishly, I want to move to where there aren't seasons.
The day your bud appeared was the happiest day of my life.
Remember me.
I've had it with you, too.
I find little solace in being the penultimate.
Sorry, I I have to leaf you...
I really dont want to leaf you!
Watch me make like a tree.
You win, big deal
Will I see you in the spring?
oh noooo!  we're next!
Finally.  Those leaf peepers were creeping me out.
Hang in there, this Fall is almost over!!
Can't you tell I'm falling for you.
The idea of “fall” is existential, why me? why today?
Oh, how I hate to leaf you.
Warn the rest, the pines were right!
Let me go down first so that I can try to catch you when you do. 
Watch out for the shear wind.
Watch out for the rake - it tickles!
Now, I recall!  My previous life was a lemming
I know this is last minute, George, but I am leaving you.
WHY HOLD ON AND DELAY THE INEVITABLE?
I'll take the fall.
'I'll never let go!' -- my ash!
Farewell... it was nice getting to know you the past six months
Well--I guess its good-bye.
Climate change is not re...
I must take off.
When everyone 'leaves', must 'fall'-ow!
If we go to the pile, I'll text you.
Why am I always the fall guy!
It was fun hangin' with you. Perhaps we'll get along better when we're both better grounded.
We're falling in love.
You're just gonna leaf me here?
I’ve enjoyed hanging out with you.
NOW you decide we’re on speaking terms again?!
Loves and leaves...what did you expect?
and then there was...never mind
I'm  falling for you, Marlene!
Well, stick with your belief system - maybe you'll fall up.
I'm hoping for a comfy place in someone's show and tell book.
Bye... Have a great fall!
It's been fun hanging with you.
I can’t believe I fell for that.
Let's face it,we always knew I'd be the first to leave.
I think that I shall never see . . . . . .
Et je m'en vais au vent mauvais...
I thought this was the family tree.
I am really starting to Fall for you.
I hear they expect to be putting on a whole bunch of new leaves after the holidays.
Don't cry - it's The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Have a nice fall.  See you next spring.
Thanks, Obama
Here I go!  It’s been a great season.
Deciduous? Now you tell me!
That’s it, I’m leafing you alone!
... the other cord, the other cord, pull the other cord Harry!
At least I'll save a fortune on property taxes.
My only regret is that I never decided between 'Autumn' or 'Fall'.
Remember our meet up spot and keep your cell phone on!
Sorry it’s over. I’m falling for someone else.
I ll give you that accounting report on Monday, ok?
Oh no !  I said I'd never leaf you !
At least we’ll always have this summer!
Everyone else is doing it. They said we'd be OK!
I know what you’re thinking — I’m just like all the others.
Ah my dearest Rupert: All that poetry we read together -- but now we see that October is the cruelest month.
"I never thought it would happen to me."
I'm leaving!
Time to move on and make way for our cousin, the snowflake.
Fall isn’t fall without falling.
Party Pooper!
This year sucked.
I'm not afraid anymore.  We'll see each other again soon.
This administration really has it out for leaves of color.
Call 9-1-1
Admission: I'm neither monogamous nor coniferous.
I still think turning sexy was worth it.
I thought you said we'd do this together.
Leafing so soon?
Stupid Socratic Method!
I’ll meet you at the fall collection.
Two houses over, meet me in the gutter at six for the"block party."
New season new me!
I thought I’d be the last one hanging.
Free at last! Free at last!
I just hope I don't end up pressed between the pages of some kid's science book.
That guy's trying to write a song--I'm going to go drift by his window!
It's been nice hanging with you.
It’s called polyamory—Look it up.
Goodbye my friend ,it was great hanging out with you"
We had a good season.
Don't worry! I know we will be raked into the same pile...
Remember... Invest for the long term.
My mom always said don’t date drop outs.
I'll be the Republican and you be the Democrat.  Lets see who falls first.
okay, you win... but next time we're playing cornhole.
You always have to be the last one to leave.
what up? you said on three...
See you next spring, bud.”
Don't be so retentive.
It's not my choice. It's my destiny.
I’m nobody without you!
Typical. Always the last to leave!
I can't wait until the kids jump on me!
Call me from the compost.
Oh THAT's why they call it that.
You win the tontine!
Hang tight, bud. I have to leaf now.
I won’t fall for anyone but you!
Lief, sorry but I must go as autumn leaves start to fall.
They say it’s not the fall that kills you.
The days dwindled down to a precious few...........
Come fall with me
I can hang on no longer with thee
Now I understand the song "The Falling Leaves"
I would as lief waft now, than be wind-torn in the future
Tell them I was brave - even at the end!
I'm reconsidering our motto: No pain, no gain.
Schandenfruedddddddddd!
“Gazuntite Buddy”
Yo me voy (time to leave).
Keep practicing your Russian.
Sorry, but I need to focus on my career.
Well looks like I'll be joining the status quo
If I don’t see you again, it’s been nice hanging out.
Those emails though.
I would have hung on, but they gave me the title of Leaf Emeritus.
We'll always have Oakland.
Same place next year?
Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!

I will call you later.
I knew you'd leave me once the Summer was over.
Come with me, Gladys! I know it will be rotten at first, but after that we can grow something big together!
Quick...the punchline!
Timber!!!
I’m going out for a pack of cigarettes
By the way - I don't believe in the Great Rake.
I hate to be the last to Fall!
I think I’ll be leaving now
I don't want to leave. It's who I am.
I always hoped I would go before you
What season is it again?
After me, the deluge
Amazing! You just won Survivor Season 40.
Summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
I knew you would leave me
Betrayer! You promised we'd leap together.
Why didn't you tell me it's already Fall?
OCTOOOoooooooooooober.
I think I’ll take a leaf of absence
Meet you at the mulch.
Oakley, I think I’m falling for you.
Your heart will go on.
Text Me
I don't care if they say they like my smell. When they kick me it still hurts like hell.
I guess climate is ‘changing’ again!”
“Right?
I’m leafing you now...
Hope you’ll fall for me later...
I know this is a terrible time to mention it, but I’ve always loved you.
We knew it wouldn't last.
I'm starting to feel a little separation anxiety.
This trust exercise has gotten way out of hand.
I'm letting go... thank you for an amazing season, my friend.
Stay golden, Murray.
Never let go, Rose. Never let go!
There must be some way to blame this on climate change.
Turn off the lights before you leave.
Don't leaf me - I'm falling for you!
I feel like I'm falling!
Look, I’m as much of a climate change denier as the next guy, but it’s February, for Chrissakes!
Is the iron turned off?
I hung on as long as I could sweetheart. See you at the composter
I said, I think I’m falling for you.
You'll always be the ultimate!
Finally, my turn.
I think it’s time for me to branch out.
Of course you will remind them that I prefer cremation over being mulched.
Wait, I think I'm falling for you........
I have to leave now,see the irony?
Call my agent...You know I don't perform without a net.
Hang tight! The fall is here.
I’ll be in brown bag on a curb. But I WILL find you!
You take the high road, and I'll...
I'd just as lief fall.
I've always been afraid of heights and now look what's happening.
Excuse me while I make wind.
I be-leaf I’m falling for you.
Now it is just me out on a limb.
You know I have separation anxiety!"
Hopefully, New Yorker caption contest players will leave out the puns!
I’m outta here; that car’s bumper sticker says ‘Leaving Trumpland.’
My Lyft’s here. Gotta blow.
Quickly now! Am I flotsam or jetsam?
You are one in a million!
That looks like so much fun, I'm going to try it!!!
Wow, is that one of those new self-driving cars?
I’m falling for you again.
Don't be judgemental, I always fall for it.
Gotta go...I'm late for my decomposition.
Last one to stay on wi-
Yes, you look nice. Now can we leave already?
It's been fun.
But her emails . . .
How can you be so fickle?
I’ll take my chances with the rake.
Jim, I just realized that I have a fear of heights.
Looks lit it is finally time to turn over a new leaf.
Falling foliage is fall's foolish folly
I'm grateful I'm not in a vacuum.
Okay, Okay. I’m going to leaf you alone and go with my friends
I know, I'm a late adapter.
We always are late to the party, aren't we?
I'm sorry, Leif, but summer romances often end in the fall.
See you on the down low.
I'd rather die than listen to one more of your stupid stories.
Larry, let go before the squirrels get here!
You're always the last one to leave.
I'm free fallin' just like Tom Petty
It was a great time, but it was just one of those things.
It's time for me to take my leave.
But Tom,....everyone leaves...
If we leaf now, we'll feel mulch better in the spring.
Just let go Autumn, the rake is oddly therapeutic
Join us.
I'll be back soon.
It's not the fall, it's the landing.
Last Leaf Hanging!
I just want to prove I'm falling for you.
Now I know what it feels like in the Trump White House.
I'd fall for you, but you're always the last to leaf!
- Are you sure we´ll see each other in spring?
I'm on my way to join the farewell party!
Don't you think we should leave. The party is obviously over.
I’m free.
And be sure to keep my TikTok profile current!
Hang on tight, Halloween is coming
Unfortunately, this will not be a temporary leave of absence.
What a symbolic way for our relationship to end.
I guess we will have to settle with a long distance relationship.
Don’t wait up. I’ll see you next fall!
I'll save a good spot for you  so you don't get run over
I never really understood the concept of "pain" until this moment.
Goodbye sweetheart, see you in the dumpster.
See you at the mulch pile, friend.
Yes. Yes, I would jump off a roof.
I really thought this year would be different.
We were rock stars! The crowds loved us!
Don't look so surprised.  You knew the day would come when I would leave.
Bye, it was really nice collecting all that CO2 with you.
I don’t mean to blow you off, but I’ve got to leaf.
I’m ready for your fallback plan now.
I'm sorry to leave you this way!
This was the summer of my life!
On second thought, I think I will believe in life after death.
Tell them I want to be burned at the curb, not buried in the landfill.
If only I'd spent more time at the office!
You wanted me to leaf you alone!
It's lonely at the top!
This is what comes from color printing.
Mother Nature always DID love you best...whoooa!
In England they don't call it Fall - it's Branchexit or Brexit for short.
Do you believe in an afterleaf?
You owe me 50 bucks!
Mamma Mia, Here we go again.
But you said you'd never leave me!
Hand on, Snoopy, hang on...
The peer pressure is too strong!
My father told me there would be a day like this.
Its over. I'm leaving.
You're just too clingy Rachel...I'm leaving!
You may find one really is the loneliest number.
I knew you'd leaf me too!
OMG! I’m not ready to leave yet.
I'm not what you think. I'm a giant brown leaf on the ground.
Don't fear the Fall,we'll Spring back!
Look...I'm making like a tree.
I'm just another victim of rakeism!
I hope I don’t fall face first
It was nice hanging out with you. See you next Fall!
Annie T. Houriez, Rueil-Malmaison (France)
They call it FALL!
There’s always next year...
Oh no, I think I‘m falling for you!!
It’s not Parkinson’s, honey. It’s death.
You knew this was a summer fling.
Don't bother mailing that letter to Santa!
Don't worry, I'll see you next Spring.
I wouldn't worry about it, 'death by Fall'
 happens every year!
On three, we both let go.
Farewell my dear. Lets hope we are raked up together.
I'm sad, but truth is, I never liked you.
AAAaaAAaAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA
[insert a corny joke here]
We thought we were in the Garden of Eden, and now, we encounter the Fall.
We fell apart, thats why Im leaving you
I hate to have to leaf you hanging
I still say you’re the one who’s chaaaaanged.
You coward!
For the life of me, I feel like this is the end.
Well, it's been a breeze.
Of course I said I’d never leave you, Ed, but this is a little different.
I liked you much more in your original color
I'm trying this new wireless technology. Can you hear me now?
I'm gonna swing forward to a double salto backward tucked with a double twist, then stick the landing!
Don't worry. Old leaves don't die, they just float away.
For God's sake,hang on as long as you can !  This guy mulches everything !!
I'm going away to explore my roots.
Hasta Leave-ista, baby!
Come on! We're gonna be late for the big rake up.
I only loved you as a function of proximityyyyyyyyyy
Just what did you promise O. Henry?
It's JUNE!
Oooh Henry. Looks like you're The Last Leaf."
Parachuting down will be fun.we just need to stay away from the composters."
I’m headed for that windshield wiper, getting outta this town.”
Once again, harsh reality intercedes shattering all illusions...!
You know why it's called Fall, don't you?
Come on! These gutters won’t fill themselves!
I hope in my next life I’m an evergreen.
They don’t value our experience at this job
Hang on, Mildred! It won't be long now!
I can’t hang on for dear life!”
I always thought there was a cord in bungee jumping.
You mean that's all there is?
What'd you think 'Fall' was?
You've got to just let go of your baggage.
Have those photosynthesis reports to me by Monday, Johnson.
Leaf me alone!
I hear the blower is more humane than the rake.
And it was going to be our first Autumn together.
Find me! I'm the orange one!
I'll find you in the centerpiece, my love!
Farewell my friend. May we see each other again in that Great Compost Pile on the ground.
I give up. The tree is yours. Much good may it do you.
Sometimes I feel so scattered
Hold on, my friend. 
Spring keeps her promise
Every year.
Always
Sorry, gotta leave.
Cancel the cable!
Hang in there Rudy, all we got is a lawyer but you’re the best
For a minute there, I thought I'd be the last leaf. Well, congrats, Larry.
I hate leafing you all alone like this.
Now if only term limits worked the same way!!
It's abscission for me! Save yourself!
I REGRET NOTHINGGGGggggggg...
Oh cheer up sweetie! We knew all along it would be just a summer romance.
They say that falling in love is wonderful...
Bye, I gotta leaf now...
Bye! See you in Campobello.
Woops, I mean the Compose Pile!
I'll take the fall for you!
And the rest is mulch.
But Mom, everybody’s doing it!
You win.  You're the last leaf standing.
Just because all your friends quit photosynthesis doesn't mean you have to.
Climate change, schmimate change, I have to make it to the pile to be jumped in by tomorrow.
Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!
I wasn't ready to fall for you!
Hang on, you’re our last hope!
I didn't know you wanted to leave the family tree that bad.
Oh wait! "Leave." I finally get it!
Catch me if you can!
I told you this relationship had an expiration date...
Hold on for dear leaf!
I've prepared a few words for our parting--oh no! I'm getting blown around like a leaf in the wind.
Find me in the afterleaf!
Don’t fall for it.
I have started to believe in God.
I hope to see you on the other side. Of the street, I mean.
I always knew he’d fall for me one day.
We’ll never be this close again.
I told you on the count of 3!
I think the pumpkin spice lattes are down there.
You heard me: Leaving, and never coming back!
I'm planning a second career as a rich member of a compost consortium.
It's finally the big fall for me Fred, hang in there as long as you can!
I'm too young to die–I never had a chance to foliage!
Will you at least tell me you'll miss me?
This is where I leaf youuuu!
Once your pride goeth, you'll join us
That chlorophyll supplement sure helped with your hanging around!
Death becomes me
By the way, I cheated on you.
I'm sorry, you're just too clingy.
Tell my story. Oh, and I enjoy Radiohead more than Thom Yorke’s solo stuff.
Please don't fall. I can't handle the thought of you leaving me.
Hang in there and tell us if Jack Frost really exists!
I always told you that I would go first.
Congratulations.  One day Holmes AND O'Henry will write about you.
I'm on my way to be in a centerpiece for Thanksgiving.
Update my Twitter bio for me!
The "Sweet Sorrow" of parting is a crock
Okay, you win, you’re the last leaf hanging.
I hate the fall - I wish I could set the clock back
Are you leafing me?
I'm not ready for the fall.
I held out as long as I could.  You take it.
I told you I would be leaving soon.
Who would have thought that falling for you would have such a literal conclusion!
I volunteer as tribute!
Why am I always the last leaf left?
Hey, you said we were going at the same time!
We'll meet at the compost pile
Hang on there buddy!
So this is why they call it fall.
You won the debate. Good luck in the election.
I have to leave now. I've fallen for someone else.
Cursed tree! I'm falling...Oh, what a world, what a world.
I choose optimism.
...And I’’ll get to heaven ‘afore Ye’
Promise me you won't leave!
I just knew, getting a tan would be trouble.
Good bye Grace. Your fall was inevitable.
No, I swear, that was my last fall pun!
See ya on the compost pile.
Remember me! You're all that we have left.
If I land face down promise you won't look at my backside!
I always said it was important to let go of attachment!
I always knew I would go first.
You’re leafing already?!?!
What did I say?
I hope that we can remain together. Otherwise it hurts to mulch.
I hope I get raked, jumped in and composted then my life would have meaning
When you are ready, you can pick me up at the curb.
I told you a kept having dreams I was falling.
I didn't mean to leave things this way!
I‘ll probably see you at the rake.
Take care and remember: Don't ever call her "The Wind". She prefers "Mariah".
I've always been more of a follower.
I said LEAF!
No big deal. I have a fear of heights, anyway.
I’ll look for you in the gutter my love!
You said it was you and me against the world!
Promise me, Rose, that you’ll never let go.
'I told you...once your chlorophyll is used up, you're toast."
And I'm free, free fallin'
When I said I was falling for you, I didn’t mean it literally.
Tell the leaf peepers I tried to hang on.
We have been inseparable.  I might as well die!
It’s true what they say — I don’t wish I’d spent more time at photosynthesis and less time fluttering in the breeze.
Sorry, Hon. California dreamin’...
Well, everyone else is doing it.
You were right--superglue is better than rubber cement.
I told you climate change was a hoax.
Traffic looks good now, but it'll pile up later
Still don't believe in climate change?
I've always dreaded the Fall.
It was a lot easier being green.
Sorry,I just can't hang around with you anymore.
Falling leaf: Schopenhauer said one must die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. 

Other leaf: Ugh, that was Nietzsche you plebe.
Gotta go.  It's Black Friday!
Bob Dylan was right! The answer is blowing in the wind.
Quick, heads or tails?
Its up to you now. The last one to leave turns out the lights.
No fair pushing!
Umm let's see who gets instagrammed first..
C'mon, everyone's doing it!
Cmon.  This party's dead.
Wait, autumn is also fall?
I thought you said to “leaf” you alone!
Of course we'll be together forever... oops.
It's affecting us as well!
You know, I never really was your friend anyway.
I told you such a close relationship wouldn’t work
I like to think of it as early retirement.
Calm down, and stop shaking.  It's simply the circle of life.
You said we'd drop together. Oh fickle, fickle leaf.
I'll see you next year. Same time; Same place?
Don't leaf me!
Bob Dylan knew the answer.......
You son of a gun!!
Sorry. The rake just makes me happier.
Woe is me! I told you I'd go first...
I wish I didn’t have to leave.
It’s not forever, Evelyn.  There’s always the compost!
It's not you. I just need to be free.
I go to seek a great perhaps!
I'm leaving you. I'm falling for the scrub.
Hey, at least the rent is cheaper on the ground level.
Let's make it a joy ride! Free fall on the sedan!
If only our season was called something else!!
Once more into the breach!
I'll see you after the Fall!
I really enjoyed our May-September romance.
WHOOAAA! This march for change has gotten out of hand!
Game over man.. Game over!
I’m going to leaf you alone for a day or two.
No, I won’t be back in time for dinner. Are you kidding?
I’m not looking forward to the commute, but it evens out with the benefits.
You're such a fall guy!
I will soon met The Grim Raker.
I waited all summer to tell you ..... I
See ya in the gutter, dude.
Oh shit I broke
Relax. I'll be back in a few.
I wish this wind would just leaf us alone!
Remind me. What's sweet about this?
You are the wind beneath my leaaaves.
GOOD LUCK —-EEEK.               SEE YOU IN THE FALL ❤️
It’s time to try obeying gravity....
Bob, don’t leave me!
Congratulations, the tontine's yours.
Don’t leave me hanging in midair.
You coming?
This "Fall" fells like deja vu.
Sometimes you just gotta accept fate.
See you in hell
Falling down is the ease part, the lawn mower is the hard part!
Face it, Helen.  We've both changed.  It's time we went our separate ways.
You're still not going to fit in.
I’m terrified of heights. Hope I come back as a worm

I told you the day would come when I'd leave you.
Play to win!
yes,they all fell for you too but this Fall is oooooooours?
Sorry. I'm leafing you now.
Look me up when you land!
I know this sounds acorn-y, but I think I am falling for you.
Boys weekend. Try not to miss me.
Better red than...Ahaaa!
This is the  penultimate experience.
Well, Alice. You were right. I‘m leaving you for that blonde.
You blew me off!
I'm falling!!!" -- "It's about time."
I'll be right back, I'm just going out for a pack of smokes.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Don't leaaafffff me!
You rake.  You pushed me.
Sorry to break it off like this,but I simply couldn't wait any longer for your decision.
Was it my breath?
oh fuck
It's a long fall.
Gotta go now. Been nice knowing you... See you next year!
Don't worry, it's less painful than watching the 2020 elections, Carl."
Sorry, Frank, I tried!
Wild ride? Ha, wait till you dance with the leaf blower.
Last one down is a rotten acorn!
Charlotte, I'm leaving you.
Aim straight for me when you come. I can't bear the thought of you with a maple.
Maybe could we try doing something different next year?
Oh Helmut don't leaf me
Get out of my life why don’t you baby,
You just keep me hanging on.
Well, leaving is such sweet sorrow!
Don't ever change!
Hope you don’t fall too far from the tree!
Fall was never really my favorite season
Even though we knew it would happen,I still didn't think it would end like this.
I like Billie Holiday as much as anyone, but I don't find autumn in New York so inviting.
At least it's a one way commute.
I refuse to be a "sap" any more - I'm going to "leaf "you now!
We always knew this would be a May-October romance.
Adios, amigo.  I'm falling down with the 99%
Remember, we're even more unique than snowflakes!
Hashtag leaving you, bitch!
Did you see where I dropped it?
Stay alive! I will find you!
Look for me on the front porch.
My only regret is not blowing all my money when I first heard about autumn.
No,YOU blow!
I'm beginning to doubt your story that 'deciduous' means 'beautiful.'
Well,  since no one has come back yet, I guess I'll go see what "Fall" is all about.
I haven't got time for the waiting game.
Remember: Tell O. Henry to write a prequel.
What are your plans for the after life?
Lock the door when you leave.
I am falling and can’t get up!
There is something very special about you.
But you said 'I jump, you jump!'
And that's when my separation anxiety started.
Well, I guess you're going to find out about this sky diving thing.
Sorry about the symmetry!
See you in the scrapbook!
I'm starting to fall for you...
Is this what they meant when they said we’ll blow you away?
Unfortunately, we are Branch Davidians.
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
...then you turn right onto 3rd St.
If you lived a good life, you will be mulched.
Don't worry...I'll meet you in the compost heap!
Have a nice fall.
They herd us up and destroy us in one blow. Call it a “pile”.
It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
There goes Pride, that's our cue.
Regrets? I've had a few.
I'm falling out of love.
Hang in there, Harry! You're our last hope!
My stupid therapist said calling it “autumn” would make this easier!
Hope to see you after the fall.
My dear Rowen, you’re  not the first to fall for me, or the last.
Next time I'm coming back as a pine needle!
It"s All About Letting Go.
You knew it would be time for Fall sooner than later.
Oh no, I'm falling for you!
Sorry, Bro, the peer pressure’s finally gotten to me.
bottomofthepilenearthestreet - see you there!
Look for me in the mulch
I'm clearly falling for you.
Act like a tree and Leave.
Hang on, Sloopy.
Sorry, but I guess I'll be leafing you all alone.
It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.
Sorry to leave you hanging on a limb.
See you in the after-mulch
There are so many things I never told you!
Leaving is such sweet sorrow.
It's not that I don't love you. It's that damn photosynthesis.
Zihuatanejo!
I'm blown away by how much I've enjoyed hanging out with you
I thought "make like a tree and leave" was just an saying!
I don't want to leave! You mean the world to me!
That does it: I'm letting go and turning a new leaf!
Leafs or leaves?
It's been fun hanging out together.
This is no time to hang about!
I'm only going because I was given a subpoena!
Honestly, I was really into our relationship this summer... now I am just cold and disconnected
And then there was one.
I'm leaving you forever.
I’m going to bed.
So much for photosynthesis.
My wish was to join the rest anyway!
Happy trails, Hans.
I guess I'll be taking my leave...
I wouldn't fall for you if you were the last leaf on Earrrrttttttttth....
Well, it looks like you win!
We'll meet again in the After Leaf
Sorry to leaf so soon”..
We'll always have this lovely tree in an upper east side neighborhood.
I hope it doesnt mulch.....
You're not gonna stand out down there, buddy!
I'll send Beth your regards.
What a weird feeling. Instead of saying "Goodbye, I love you, I'm thinking g = 9.807 m/s2.
Same old, Same old
Looks like you are the last one Betsy
Sure - you hang on. I'll take the fall for the president.
And I said I'd never leave you.
I know it's fall. But until now, I never thought we were supposed to take it literally.
I've got it! I've got the answer!!
Darn, I didn't even start to spend down my nest egg yet
This is why my favorite season is Spring.
Hey if I don’t see you, have a really nice Fall
You don't need to know how to fly.
I'll see you later, on the ground.
Sure.  I'll take the Fall.
Bye, it was fun hanging with you this summer.
Let go, Larry. The burning ban is in place for another week.
Sorry, I just can’t hang out with you anymore.
Let's wait 'til after Thanksgiving weekend to fly.  Less crowded then.
Yes, I do find “dropping like flies” to be really impertinent!”
But you said that you'd never leaf me.
If reincarnation is real, see you next spring.
You get the idea.
I suppose I'm not the first to fall for you.
Don't kick me out. I promise I'll turn over a new leaf.
Good-bye Sloopy. Hang on !
Think of me as someone who leaves you.
Not even global warming can save us!
You won - the last to fall!
We keep in touch about Thanksgiving
I hate to leaf you all alone.
Sad? Yes. But, just get over it.
Don't keep us waiting, the more the merrier!
I’ll  meet you in the tool box for
the winter. It’s isolated.
This vacation is a letdown.
I don't care what "everybody" says, it's not Fall until I say it's FAAAAAAAAA!
I didn’t realize “Fall” was so literal!
I take that back. Fall is definitely my least favorite season.
No wait!  I said heads.....HEADS!
‘You still think Fall is your favourite season?’
When I dressed in fall colors, I had no idea.
Yeah, you won this time, but I swear next year I'll be last!
I don't know but everybody yells Geronimo.
And here I thought being green was sustainable.
My heart will go on, Rose!
My Fall is done. See you next Spring.
This is a madhouse!”
Remember, I want my remains mulched.
I don't recall deciding to be deciduous
Lief, I'm so sorry to be leaving you.
I was hoping not to leave without you!
I got the short end of the stick.
Let it be recorded in the Autumn Annuals, "I fell for you.'
Strange, I'm getting this funny feeling of deja vu...
I'm calling a lawyer.
I'm falling for a rakish young man.
“When breeze comes to blast ....  looks like you’ll be last.”
You win—the oak’s all yours; I just couldn’t bear another one of your  ‘leaf’ or ‘fall’ jokes.
The party was over a long time ago.  Why are we always the last to leave?
Goodbye. I must leave you now.
With some luck, we'll end up in the same compost.
Remember, Frankie, we’re leaves, not stays!
Just don’t think I’ve fallen for you.
One last thing, I had sex with your wife.
Oh no, the rake said it would be fine, but he said I could just check out what the ground is like, and if I don't like it I can come on back
See you in hell Pilgrim
That joke was in poor taste!
You ever read any O Henry stories?
You're not invited.
This time it doesn't feel like a dream.
If I don't see you at the landfill I'm probably stuck in some kid's art project.
Join us at the compost pile if you start feeling lonely."
(Michael Rogness, St. Paul MN
Your attitude about the upcoming election just blows me away..
You're strong. You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you! Just stay away from kids with wax paper.
Is there sap after death?
If the Downton Abbey movies stinks..... don’t tell me
Be sure to get the Advil royalties...
Before I leave, tell Roots I love her.
I hate piles.
I kept trying to tell you that there was NO WAY the white house could provide that kind of protection!
...and don't forget to fertilize the lawn
All I ever wanted was to not be like everyone else.
Look me up on 'Rakebook'.
Sorry Janet. I'm leaving you for a perennial.
I'll be known as the penultimate leaf!"
Damn it! I thought this year I’d get to see Winter.
Have you ever thought that they know something you don't?
It is my time to participate in 'the fall.'
Promise me you'll survive. That you won't give up, no matter what happens, no matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose, and never let go of that promise.
I know we talked about this day, but...
Blower or Rake ? Wonder what's in our destiny!
Remember your training!
New England! I will wait for you!!!
I'll never let go, Jack! I'll never let go!
I'll leaf you alone.
Bye!  I'm leafing you.
I hope the compost pile is organic!
You were always the best of us, Bob!
Betcha ten you go first
As they say in Proverbs, "Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before the fall "
Okay, that's it, I'm tired of hanging around with you
Come on. If you wait too long, I can't guarantee that I can save you a place.
Grounded
Yeah?  Well, I won’t miss the seasons.
But I am not "reddy" yet!
It’s all in the landing
'Meet me in the rake!'
If I can, I’ll send you a sign that all is well with me down there.
'To you, all that I leave behind...'
Laying on the ground is so degrading.
In case something happens to me, the password for my account is.....
My time has come to leaf you alone!
Just hold on, I'm going home.
I’ll see you next year
Well, I thought it would be better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all; but now I’m not so SUUURRREE
I knew it was a mistake to join the Cabinet!
Im sorry Tod, but these streets need me!
I'm sorry I gotta go! I just have really bad FOMO.
Next year, I really hope to reincarnate on a pine tree.
We're the last two. Goodbye!
Nothing gold can stay.
Look Mom, no hands!
'So long, it's been good to know yuh . . .'
Honey I'll wait you in the car.
see you in front of the car
Quod Infirmum Fuit Heres, Now  Leaf  Me  Alone."
Don't worry, we're all getting together later.
And they were roommates.
I guess this means we are separating
I don't want people peeping me anymore
You remind me of O'Henry's  "The Last Leaf"
as they say in old country, sorry to leaf you
Apocalypse!
I don't like dropping in unannounced!
Even with all the chaos, you have proven to be stronger than all of us. You are committed and don't have attachment issues. Stay strong my friend. May we meet again.
Welp, it’s been real.
Before the I hit the ground and the wind takes me, remember me when I was green and young.
Why didn't you tell me? I'll be waiting for you next door, by the fireplug.
I can see my second cousin down there
This cartoon is in color....don't say anything 'off-color.'
At least you won't be the last rose of summer.
You hanging around for it bit Harry?
I guess we'll pick up this conversation next year.
It's time for this Orange One to join the rest of the Cabinet!
We were unique as a couple, but now I must join the anonymous multitude.
Our father was a maple!
The secret to staying on is AAAGGH!!!
What was that thing you said about pride?
It's not you, it's me. And the changing seasons.
Do you think the fallen will charge us with collusion?
I thought we agreed this was a Trust Fall!
Stay alive.  No matter what occurs.  I will find you!
Well, looks like you're the last of our kind.
Can you believe this shit?
You are the last leaf on the tree.
Do you come here wafting?
Like you said, “This must be the end of the Tourist Season"
I'll be "leave"ing now
You’re always the last to go.
Leafing you?  Fear not, my love.  We two shall meet anon in mulch time.
Well, it's either this or a corn maze.
Don't forget to put the trash out before you leave!
Look at the state of this yard! Absolutely unbeleafable.
Goodbye and good luck with that mulch thing you wanted to do.
Come on!  Nobody's going to call you a lemming!
To hell with autumn dignity!  GERONIMO!
The moment I saw you in orange, I fell.
It pains me to say this but I must leaf you now.
I'll see you on the other side, brother.
Oh no! It's October!
This is we're called 'leaves' ''
I think I'll just drop by some old neighbors.
See you next May as a darling bud!
I'm just so tired of being ogled by the leaf peepers!
I'm sorry to LEAVE you all alone!
The inseparable leaves-we fall together in this autumn and shall rise thereafter in this cold lights.
I hate to leave you, but I must.
But I didn’t get your number!
OH, TOM!
My STEM has failed me!
I was puuusheddd....
Remember what Whitman wrote "I stop somewhere waiting for you."
I’’ll race you to the ground!
Looks like your it ! Good luck .
Fall means fall. Now get with the program.
I swore I’d never fall for you.
I hope to see you at the big compost in the sky...
Well Fred, you ready to caress his damn window!
Oh Henry, you're the last leaf!
Finally, we discover our true colors and then there lies our fate.
I thought the apples would be the end of the lay-offs
Well, if they didn't want us on their lawn, why did they plant so many trees?
Hate to leave you dangling, but I can't hang out any longer.
Don’t worry.  O’Henry implied that it’s for a good cause.
Okay. I've always been quercus, but so are you.
Live in color.
I'm not ready to leave!
I like the 'Spring' part better than the 'Fall' part.
I'M going to the family reunion!
Already?! It's only August!
Text me when you're ready to leave.
It must be good if everyone's doing it.
It's a die-in to demand action on climate change.
Leave for the two of us!
And these few  precious days I've spent with you !!
Is this the art of letting go!
Gone with the wind.
Another leaf down, do you copy? This is a 10-17!
Auntie Em! .. there’s no place like home!
I know it's a leap of faith - but there is no other way to become well grounded!
I’m sorry , but I’m  Breaking it off !
Oh, NOOOOOOOOO!!
Hang in there Jerry … I gotta leave now.
Rose! There's room enough for two of us on the door!
Just the thought of leaving blows me away!
oh that's it...I can't hang on any longer.
Do you ever feel like you may be the last leaf on the tree?
I don't understand people who say this is their favorite season!
Spoiler Alert!
I'll meet you under the shrub. We can hide there.
Drain, rake, or fire - I’ll always love you.
Bye Feleafsha
I'll save you a spot in the gutter!
You must promise me that you’ll survive, that you’ll never give up, no matter what happens, no matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose.
Please don't leave me alone . . . .
See you on Instagram.
I'll save you a spot on the lawn.
It was just a spring and summer fling. Get over it.
Well, I’ll be taking my leave now.
Hang on Ryan, if you make it to November 1, you win the jackpot.
Orange team wins immunity!
I've had it with Photosynthesis; I'm into Selfies now.
Always the show off, aren't you?
Look for me in the gutter!
Stan, all puns aside, I'm leaving you.
Another one bites the dust
Remember when I told you about Lemmings?
Man! Not again...
I hope I see you in the afterleaf
I’ll text you when I arrive.
I'm heading right for the gutter !!
We go through this every year. You need to just let go already.
You said we go on 'threeeeeee!'
Rookie, huh? Everyone leaves the branch sooner or later.
Good bye So long Farewell forever!
I hate leaf blowers too but it happens to the best of us.
So long! It’s been nice hanging with you.
Be careful when you get down there. You"ll be 
a 'has been' and they'll step all over you."
I should have said you first!
Did you say Go towards the Light or say my mantra?
Meet me over by the hedge.
I'm so gonna stick the landing.”
You always said you needed more space.
So, hummus or humus?
On trend
Don’t wait up for me.
You hang on.  I'll call O. Henry.
if I don't see you in the leaf bag, I'll catch up with you at the dump
No!! Let go on threeee...
So this is what the song was about.
If it wasn't such a  mess down there, I wouldn't be so sad to go.
Fine, I'll make like a tree and-"
"Enough with the puns, Jerry. You're dying.
Aim for the roof.  That rake is real dream killer.
It’s me, Edna.  It’s not you.
It's time to take my leave.
I'm not leaving. I just need a little space.
Guess this is why they call it Faaaaalllllllllllll!!!!....
I know Autumn Leaves must fall but what key is it in?
Rose, never let go!
I told you not to fall for me
See you again on Groundhog Day!
I'm not taking a fall. That's not the kind of leaf I am.
Hold on tiiight!!!
I warned you - stop whistling that damned ‘Autumn Leaves’ or I’m outta here!
I gotta mulch now dude. See you in the spring.
If I don't like it, I can always come back.
If you don't make the O. Henry story, try for a New Yorker cartoon.
Houston, we have a problem!
Mother Nature and I are splitting up.
Uhhh. I don't think my insurance covers this.
It will be a nice float down, but I worry a little about getting lost in the litter below.
But dad! Everyone is doing it nowadays!
You always were a fair weather friend, Susan.
If we're both gonna die this way, I'm going on my own terms!
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in Autumn....!?
If I don't leave now, I'll always wonder what if."
Dustin Jacobs, Los Angeles, Calif
I need to branch out, there are thousands below.
Help me, I’m Fall-ing!
According to Newton, this is what we do.  We fall.
Am I really going to a better place?
It’s been real
You knew I was polyamorus
I’ll miss hangin with you.
Well, at least I'm not the last fall guy.
That's not what I had in mind when I asked you to leaf me alone!
Suddenly I understand why we are “leaves.”
You’re not so special yourself!
Leaf and let die!
Oh no - here comes a garbage truck.
You're too clingy.  I'm leaving!
There's got to be more than just sprouting, getting old and flying".
My friends all warned me not to fall for you.
I never thought I would be the first to leave.
Oh I get it...fall!
I had fun. Let's try to do this again next year.
I’ll see you in the bag!
Oh boy, looks like I’m falling into a pattern.
No one will sweep me off my feet like you. Stay true.
And away we go!
O Henry -- It's up to you now!
I guess summer vacation's over!
See you next Spring! Same tree, same limb
Gotta go, I think I left the stove on.
I’m aiming for the bushes.
I'm going to drift by that window so they can dream of summer kisses.
It's the age difference. IT would have never worked between us!
“We leaves stand out in the flux because we have an imperishable soul, but all we can do is observe ourselves & the world in the grip of  ceaseless...hey hey you listening? Forget it.  Good luck Buster we should’ve been born four leaf clovers!!”
If all your friends jumped off a br...
Hope to see you in a wreath.  
Otherwise, I’ll meet you in the compost pile”.
It's time to make like a tree and leave.
In the larger scheme of things, a compost pile wouldn't be such a bad deal !"
This beats a no deal Brexit.
Oh the foliumanity!
Tell me - my memory's failing, Are we Falling Leaves or Autumn Leaves?
When you remember me, remember me as green.
Ashes to ashes, compost to compost.
What a waste. My rent is paid up through the end of the month.
I thought, we were going to branch out together
Everything doesn’t always have to be your idea.
Just remember ..... Green Waste!
I regret not showing my true colors!
What happened to 'if I fall you'll catch me!?
Hold that thought.
OK, I'll be the fall guy.
Winter is Coming?
I’ll see you at the bonfire.
Well, you finally achieved that "naturally windswept" look.
My green card's been rev-oak-ed!
Bye Walt, it’s time for Leaves Of Grass.
Sic transit gloria mundi...
Goodbye, Wellenough
See you inside the Street Sweeper
LODFOB. Last one down, first one burned!
I never told you it was forever.
I never thought I would fall for you!
Tell my twig I love her!
Didn't I tell you fall fashion gets dropped really quickly back on May Day this year?
Ashes, ashes, all fal down.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say goodbye till I be mulch
You're the last one hanging on, you win the car!
If you really loved me,Ted, you'd take the plunge with me.
Olly olly oxen free!"
Queue Roger Williams.
Blow me away!
Well, they say it's a long, long time from May to December, but we'll never know.
It will be a re-leaf  to join our friends down below.
The rest is silence.
Must be sweeps week.
Gravity is not your friend.
Don’t worry you won’t feel a thing when the power mulcher gets you.
I never meant to leave you this way.
It's true, I'm falling for you.
I will find you! No matter how long it takes, no matter how far. I will find you!
That's fall for you.
3 pm at the corner
I think they took me off my chlorophyll too soon.
I just knew I'd go first when I saw my face spots in a mirror.
I've always told you you're drop dead beautiful, Leslie.
If I can stick the landing, I should get maximum points with this jump.
You’re such a hanger-on!
I warned you gravity wasn’t our friend.
It’s not you, I’ve just changed.
i guess i'm falling for someone who actually sticks around.
PLEASE...I PROMISE TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF
I guess I spoke too soon.
Falling—we do that all the time.
Composting is just a passing fad. I'm looking for a career in mulch.
Come on.  You'll be late.
No, please, don't ground me!
I pray that my next reincarnation will be in the tropics...
Drop by when you can. See You.u..u...u….u.....
Oh, the Humanity!
You’re the champ.
I thought we had a connecting flight!
I just feel falling separately will make us closer.
If the rake piles us together, then maybe it's meant to be.
I get why they call it fall.
Cue the Mad Men title theme!
Alright, you win.  See you next year.
Ok, I'll try to land on the car, and when you're ready, we're out of here!
Same time again next season?
I thought you said you wouldn't leave me when the seasons change
Have to leave now!
I just want you to know I'm falling for you.
I thought we changed it to spring forward, autumn back
I'm going to leaf you alone now.
That's why they call us 'leaves.'
Well, I do hope we waft into each other soon.
Why do things like this always happen to me!
'I guess it is time for me to make like a tree and go'
‘It’s soooo beautiful in the fall’ she said...
Well,I guess t6his is goodbye!
Hurry up, Joey! We’re leafing!
I hate to be leafing  you.
Darn!  You win again!
Who’s favorite time of the year is this?
I think I'm finally falling for you.
I NEVER LIKED YOUUUUUUUUU
Hang in there, I'm leafing.
It's called Fall for a reason.
Why do you always get to be last?
You said you wouldn't leaf me! You're just like all the others.
I'm not falling for that routine.
Like I always told you - we all have to 'leave' sometime
There goes the neighborhood!
I'm ready for the Fall
Please promise you’ll look for me.
The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day.
That's it, Petal.  I'm leaving you!
From our first delicate buds, to our months in the sun charged with chlorophyll, to our gentile decent back to earth, it's been a beautiful life.
Welp there goes the family reunion...
This doesn't mean you're better than me!
Watch out for the angry, swearing guy.
But what if I come back as an Awesome Burger?
Well, when I voted for abscission I didn't think it would affect me!
Ight imma head out
Call our lawyers! We have tenants' rights!
What are you holding out for?
Some of us fall by the wayside.
And some of us soar to the stars... this is the circle of life, Simba!”
I wish I had my portrait done.
All The Leaves Are Brown. And, I must be on my way
Darling! Please leave with me!
I'll pay you back that $54.50 next fall.
Don't forget - the cash is in the trunk!
Sorry, I just need a little street cred.
I can't take the peeping anymore!
Those sadists are enjoying this.
I'll catch up with you near the rake...
And the days dwindle down to a precious few."
Tolstoy said there'd be honey!
I'm starting to fall....I'll miss you most of all....Hey! There's a song in there somewhere...
It's not the falling that scares me.  It's being ran over and tramped down into non-existence that scares me.
Aah! I wish we were coniferous!
I’m done.  I am going to a better place.  Meet you on the other side.
Tell me how it ends, will you.
Don't leaf me hanging!
Hang in there Mike. You're the last one now...
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
And see where we land.
Remember, take the same xylum as last year!
Ohhhhhhh here I go, off to join our friends in low places.
I hate to leave you alone
That’s it! I’m moving to Florida!
I’m falling...in love with you
There's a reason they call it "Fall Foliage".
You know you really should let go.
I was counting on you leaving with me.
I really love ya honey, but the season’s over.
Don't be so shocked we'll be leafing together soon
Farewell for now as I join my fellow leaves of grass!
I should have been above Law of Nature!
I'd hoped our breakup would go better than this.
It’s not you. I just don’t care for May-December romances.
Clearly they know something we don't!  Geronimo!!
Where's your atheist deleaf system now? 
THE RAPTURE COMETH!
Sorry to leave now, but it's time to fall.
There was definitely room for two on this branch...
I’ll try to be back before dark, but just in case ... don’t wait up for me.
Well, so long. Too bad Johnny Mercer isn't around any more to write about us.
Evidently the anti-aging cream didn't work.
Aw, C'mon
Leaves with human faces are not immune to the fate common to all l e a v e s !
Don't you dare leaf me hanging
I hope we can still be friends.
Do not go gentle, my petiole!
Yeah, well I rather being called a sheep than a has-been.
But Jack, there was enough room on this tree for both of us!
Oh!, this is me. But maybe I’ll see you later in one of these roof gutters?
At least we had a long and healthy leaf-span!
So, this is what fall feels like.
Remember. The plural of leaf is still leaves.
Ok, just say it...if my friends jumped out of a tree, would  I jump too
I had an entire farewell based upon the Hegelian dialectic but all I can think now it's fall; I fall.
Yeah, I know I shouldn't have fallen for it.
Mom, I'll be back by midnight.
Is this what you meant when you said to branch out?!?!
I warned you not to sneeze.
See you at Mulch Madness!
It should have been you.
Last down is a rotten leaf
I'll go see what's happening.  I'll be back in a minute.
See you on the flip side.
But I’m younger than you!!!
See you on the other side "
I hope we wind up in the same compost heap.
Sorry, I have to leave now.
I, like you, thought I could remain above it all.
Sorry to leave on such short notice.
Cowabunga!
Think of it as a trial separation.
See you on the other sidewalk, brother.
I knew I should have charged my phone!
I'm sorry if my snoring kept you awake.
Let’s hang out again next year!
So cloooose
Good hangin’ with you.
What do you mean, they didn't renew our lease?
I'm falling and kitschy metaphors are all you've got?
Just remember your training. You’ll be fine.
I just got a great deal on my car insurance by switching to GEICO.
Why did you think they call it fall?
You know, summer flings are really falling out of fashion.
I'm falling for you, so it's time for me to leave.
To leave until to leaf, that is my suggestion.
One day, people will analyze this moment, so I swear now, there wasn't enough room on that branch for the both of us.
Harold, I guess you'll be, 'The Last Leaf."
I'm sorry Leif, I gotta give in to peer pressure. My parents always said I would never turn a new leaf.
Falling Apart
After you're trampled afoot, meet me in the compost pile if you're able..
Cya on the other side
And so, I'm like, "Ain't nobody got time for thaaaaaat!
I’ll see you in the next leaf
Well at least we made it as the final
two cabinet members of the Trump tree administration.”
Darn it, I thought we had more time together!
Hang on, buddy!
You win, last to fall......
Oh I don’t know. It just feels we’re doing it every year...
Ow! That hurt!
It was nice knowing you. Hope I see you on the pile.
I liked this better when it was just once a year in October.
I’ve decided to branch out a bit, as I felt like we were just hanging.
You just have to embrace this new season.
Stay gold, Ponyboy!
Please don't leaf me!!
Goodbye
Sorry, but winter is coming even without that show on anymore.
Drop by on your way down!
The verdure, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind.
When you fall off, promise you'll come find me!
Ralph ! Just go with it !
‘Guess I’ll be turning over to a new leaf now.’
I don't want to die, I'm scared
A bird, a bird!  My kingdom for a bird!
This argument is NOT over mister. We meet on the pavement at dusk.
In my next life I'm coming back as a Nissan Leaf.
Fall is the worst season for breakups.
We all got to fall sometime.
It’s time you knew — I’m falling for another leaf.
Karen...I'm leaf-ing you.
Why couldn't I be a pine on a pine tree!
They told me they packed my golden parachute!
The promise of an "after-leaf" just turned a little darker.
Never let go.
They want me to take the fall for Guiliani.
I’m not the fall guy here
I'm sorry it had to end this way, but we've been branching apart for a while. The time for me to leaf is now.
The tree doctor did say our October mortality rates were high.
Looks like you’ll be the last survivor on this branch of the family tree.
I'm not ready to be turned into an art project!
I guess you're the last to leave...
I support the Hong Kong protests!
Rudy, you're fired!
...promise me...that you will never give up...no matter how hopeless...promise me now, and never let - Whoops!
I'll never let go, Jacaranda!
Bruce, you’re our last hope!
We'll meet again... Don't know where, don't know when...
It's been a good run, but everyone's leaves in the end.
See ya on the dance floor!
I guess I have to accept that I’ll be spending the rest of my life in the gutter
Remember, try for Mr. Robertson's place, he doesn't rake.
Bye Buddy.  Hope you find your dad!
Ya better click on Sap-Saver...
You can find me six inches from the left front tire for the next few minutes. After that, who knows?
Whelp, time to make like a tree....
God help me if I end up as "art".
See you in the the underworld!
I am just blowing in the wind.
I'm falling for you,babe!
You picked a fine time to leaf me, Lucille.
You never die!!!
You just furnish
The Future. .
          Or     '   
You forgot 
To not be an 
Asshole 
Huh Henry?
Or
Geronimo!!!
Or
"Kiss Today Goodbye"
Well, gotta go ...
Don't worry, you're going to make some little kid very happy
See you on the ground!"
I think I'm falling for you... at last Rose.
Sorry, but it’s time I make like a tree and leave.
One bottle of beer on the waaaall...
sad to leaf  you
I hope he got the leaf blower fixed this time. Last Fall he ripped me to bits with that damn rake.
I'm an Autumn man myself. Fall sounds so final.
It's time for me to leaf, I'm sorry.
¨I´ll meet you under the tree.¨
Oh damn. I forgot to fill out the FAFSA.
I wish they'd stick with AUTUMN. FALL is so reductive.”
You are the last Trump hold-out. I am leafing you alone.
It's the standard saga of life and death - I fall, you fall, everybody falls ... and the generations roll.
Its the leaving I hate.
I'll keep an eye out for you!
I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree . . . whoops, gotta' go.
Next you’ll be saying bonfires are real!
Sorry to leaf you dangling alone up here.
Is this what they call Separation Anxiety?
Don't worry Liz, I'll wait for you.  I won't blow away like last year.   I was young and stupid then.
They advised collagen, but I ignored them.
Sum quod eris!
I THOUGHT WE AGREED WE'D GO TOGETHER, YOU SONNNNNN OF A BBBBBBBBB......
I’m just going to buy a leaf blower.
You just need to believe; it’s greener on the other side!
looks like I got the victory royale!!!!!!!
Leave no child behind.
I hate Shakespeare!
It’s time to flip, Mitch.
I was really enjoying this global warming thing.
NOT my favorite time of the season...
It's true...I'm leaving you. I'm falling for someone else.
Cannonball!
And you never saw my Trump impersonation.
Martha, I'm leaving you now. I 've  fallen for another woman. Don't even think about following me.
They bought a blower this year, right?
This proves my point — that it’s best to be the last two to leave the party!
I'll be in Bob and Karen's yard.
I thought we were both supposed to fall ON the count of three.
Nobel-schmobel.  The answer is NOT blowing in the wind.
You said 'together!'
I'm really tired of having to go through this again every year!
What is the point in hanging on, really?
I thought you said we would turn over a new leaf together?
I know, it's hard to let go.
Out, out, brief candle
The Last Duet of Summer
Last one down picks up the tab
I ‘m leaving, hope you get picked up by a handsome young man.
No, it's too late for counseling.
I’ll try to save you a spot, Harry!
See ya down the road
Leaves”? “Fall”? This was inevitable.
Uh oh! Our relationship is falling apart.
Hang in there. With a little more global warming you might never Fall.
There WAS a quid pro quo! Remember that, and you'll be fine!
Don’t wait up.
A few of us are getting together in the gutter tonight—see you there?
I told you that I'd go before you!
Sorry, Donald JT, I know I said I'd stick with you until the bitter end, but time for Rudy G to look out for Number 1 like everyone else!
No fair, you pushed me!
I'm falling... but not for you.
I have to go, I have been subpoenaed for the impeachment probe.
Sorry, but I really hate being late.
I bet it doesn’t even look like I care.
Same time next yearrrrrrr.....
spring might really hang you up the most,
but fall can really bring you down.
But mum, all my friends are falling !
Looks like I’ll have to leaf now!!
Why can't we spring instead of fall?
I can't wait to get down there and finally live the rake 'n roll lifestyle.
Don't worry, that's the cycle of  leaf. You were meant to fall
You KNOW I can’t control if I cascade blithely on top of your wife?
You go, we go!
I guess that's why they call it leaving.
I never liked the idea of seasons
Nice hanging out with you this summer
Water my plants for me!
Add me on Snapchat @Maple_babe00 #Loveemandleaveem #Yolo #Sorrynotsorry #Pumpkinspiceeverything
Make a wish
‘I’ll miss you most of all....’
I hate to leave, but I just haven't been myself lately.
Hey dude...come find me when you get in!
But you said you wouldn’t leaf me!
I am so sorry to have to be leafing you alone.
It's leave taking-time.
I don’t care what you say, the others must be on to something!
Seriously? You think you'll have a shot with some hot green leaf next spring?
That´s why we´re called "leaves".
I told you the generic chlorophyll wouldn’t work as well.
Will you remember to turn off the lights?
Alright, you win!
I take your leave, sir!
I told you that a severe loss of chlorophyll would be your downfall!
Ftgt rdd
I told you it was time to leave!
Whatever happens, don't date a nut!
Join me on the hood.
I must leaf.
Join me at the leaf blower bar for a dance.
Leaf  OVERBOARD!
I'm leaving you Bob, it's over between us.
It looks like I have to “leave” you now.....
On the bright side, I hear that the leaf blower is nice and warm.
See you in the bardo!
I guess I'll see you in the pile.
Woah, Nelly, We're going to be mulch
See you at the pearly rakes!
Last one down is a rotten xanthophyll!
When a leaf leaves a leaf, are they no longer leaves?
So you were saying, "Even if you were the last leaf in the world..."
So she said, if all the other kids jumped off a bridge...
I have to tell you, it wasn’t your acorn.
You’ve blown me off one too many times.
I was relying on global warming this year!
This leaf must leave before she is left
Don’t pine for me.
Please oh please don’t let me get caught in the windshield wiper!
Help I’m falling for you
You need to work on Letting Go
... no, no, no — it’s not you. It’s me.
Hasta la vista baby, I have a gutter to clog!
I hate to  leave.
You are  now the last Leaf  hold out for Fake Climate Change
Delete my birch history!
Damn, I really do want to talk about this more, but my Uber's here. I gotta run. Hope your dad doesn't have cancer or whatever.
Oh Claudia! If only I didn't have to leaf you alone.
I’m joining the capitulating masses.  You must face an uncertain future on your own!
You mean you really WOULD jump off just because all your friends did?
See ya in the pile.
It's a far, far better thing I doooo...........
At least we don’t have to rake ourselves.
Carl, I never thought that you would be the one to leaf us and start another branch.
I can't help it. I think that I must have been a lemming in a past life.
Can you define “psithurism”?
It's not you! I simply have to follow my destiny.
Come Fly With Me???
Promise me now Rose, and never let go of that promise.
How could I have possibly seen this coming!
Oh no ! I will miss all that impeachment thing !
Don't worry.  We believe in reincarnation.  Maybe we will be Maple next time.
Yes ! I won, I'm the last warrior ! 
Let the wind be with you my friend.
Parting is such leaf sorrow.
Good luck.  I hear the new superintendent wants us all off the streets.
Why would you leave me here all alone?
So we’ll get raked into a pile, and dogs will pee on us.
Sorry, Mom. All of my friends are doing it!
Fred, this is where I say, "Manana!"
So long.   It has been nice knowing you.
see: https://medium.com/@jerrygriswold/autumn-the-lessons-of-the-trees-c15a7be4eea8
Don’t forget to breathe
I can't hold on any longer....save yourself!
It’s all in how you look at it.
Come find me, I'll be the orange one
A poignant but frequently fatal result of being out on a limb.
See you same time next year?
I just need a change of scenery.
My friend, it is time to leave.  Follow me!
What do you mean there’s no leaf heaven?!
See you on the downside!!!
Don't worry about me, I'll end up in a French song
Our DNA is definitely not coniferous!
Ohhhh.  My parachute isn’t opening.
Sad to say, I’m leaving you now.
I'm going to leaf you alone.
I’m falling for you and my lack of chlorophyll
'Since you told me to leaf you alone...'
Look me up when you get to Boca.
I’ll wait.  You won’t have any trouble finding me.
I said I'd never leaf you.
I always thought you would be the one to leave first.
It’s not you, it’s just nature’s abscission
You drift,I drift,Jack.
Remember my net negative  carbon footprint.....
Hey, Make like a tree and Leaf”
Always the last to leave the party!
Winter's cominnnnnnnng....
I always knew I’d be the first to go.
Nothing like being fashionably late!
Oh no, you're leaving me so soon?
It’s like falling off a log.
I think we should spend some time apart
You can’t prove your point when there’s no one left to prove it to!
Geronimo!”
“That’s politically incorrect
Oh no, this is the autumn of my life.
Oh come on!..we're all going
You know, I hate to leaf you...
I
'Tis the season.
so long,it has been great to know you!
- You jump, I jump!
- ......
Ahhhh... Where is the life alert button?
Let's grab a drink at the Halloween mixer.
I feel we've just grown apart.
I know you said don't leave me, but......
I’m only leaf-ing ‘til next fall!
Global warming came too late for me.
I've always followed the crowd.
Meet me in the pile by the mailbox.
Jefferson lives.
I promise I'm not falling for you.
I never loved you, Jerry, and I negotiated a plea deal to come back as a squirrel next time. Rot in hell, asshole.
Hurry!  Come on with me!
You know I don’t like crowds.
I wish I could maintain a relationship longer than a year.
Pride goeth before a fall.
Well, Leif -- one can't rely on middle-aged whimsy forever.
Don't let them rake me!
That's OK; I didn't like my new hair color anyway.
It was me that kept brushing up against you this whole time.
I'll see you next fall.
Oh my, here I go,
On my way down below
No more fluttering
I hate to leave you some,
For now you have become
The last leaf
Kansas was right, Bob, don't hang on.
Yeah we blend
They say it's ghosting season!
soon we'll be falling, I love you
Uh oh. It's time to get raked over the coals.
Don't let go, Jack!
Farewell, my love. It was a beautiful summer romance.
Hold on, you have something caught in your ... There, got it!
Life, death and the changing of the seasons. Very funny. See you in the compost.
To fall in the fall is our destiny--but is it going to hurt?
The Fall commeth!
You always were a loner, Cindy.
Wake up, it's fall!
Ask not for whom the wind blows....
I’m falling and I hope I can get up.
Leif, it's time to let go.
Do'nt be so heartbroken,dear,we shall meet on the earth soon
Be back in a minute!
I believe we'll see each other again in the same compost heap.
I have to tell you...I've been seeing the Maple from across the road.
Guess we’ll have to leave that till next time!
Oh no, the kid with the magnifying glass... No, wait. NO! The composting freak!
See Ya mulch later.
It may be too late, but I’m falling for you
We may meet again, Bob. The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the gardener's leaf blower.
It’s up to you now! I resisted as long as I could but now I’m falling for the pitch.
Yes, I would jump off the bridge as well! It's they way of our ancestors to "leave" in "the fall"
Per my will, please have my remains raked into a pile of other's remains!
FREEDOM! HORRIBLE FREEDOM!
One small step for a leaf; one giant leap for leafkind
See you on the other side, buddy.
I so wanted to be the one to hear the reading of the will.
If you win by blowing pepper in my face, did you really win?
THERE SHE GOES, JUST A WALKIN DOWN THE STREET!
Wake up, show's over!
Now that "till death do us part"  thing makes sense
I'm in a flutter and have to leaf now.
I'll meet you at Main Street and Elm.
I always said they took fall too literally.
Catch you later. I have a date with a rake.”
Oh, what a world.
Remember meeeeeeeeeeeee......
I hope DiCaprio plays me in the movie!
I'll give your regards to Broadway.
I'll wait for you in the pile.
Just as you said...I see a light...but it appears to be a red stop light
Is Wild is the Wind still your favorite song?
We’re going to end up down there? ... with them?
Catchya later
À bientôt!
I feel like our relationship is falling apart!
Nobody told me about the Fall.
Fall out Of love
My turn to leave
I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP
SINGING: I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like, Gotta be mean, Gotta be Green.... INTERRUPTING: Humphrey, we're leafing!
I’ll see you next spring!
It's up to you, Bob--tell the world our story!
Sorry to leaf you alone like this.
I’m in the wind now.
Remember when we sang "Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most"? Well, now it's "Autumn Leaves."
I'm sorry Wilson.  I've simply fallen out of love with you.
I told you we should have gone to the country. The city is always so crowded this time of year.
Sorry to leaf. Have a nice fall!
At least you won't be afraid of heights anymore.
Enjoy your trip
“See you next fall”
And you swore you would never leave me.
It's been nice ...I'll  wait for you below....Don't hang on too long....
Dad, does this mean that I'm gonna meet Grandma?
Farewell Mr. Erikson.
Sorry but I got to leaf ya
It's OK, I'm afraid of heights anyway"
I thought we were falling for each other?
Like the Trump future the only way is down
Bye Bye Dear. See you soon.
After all those therapy sessions and you STILL have separation anxiety?
The leaf goeth during the fall.
I guess this is where "'til death do us part" comes in.
It's a Fall thing.
Hey Leif, I’LL SEE Youu onnn theee grooouuunnnndddd
Now I know why the call 'Autumn' fall!
It looks like fall is finally here.
I'm tired of being your fall guy!
We'd better hurry before all the good spots are taken.
Hang tough and be-leaf in yourself.
If You're a bird, I'm a bird...
I can’t beleaf you are blowing me off like that
This is why I kept saying i’ve Always preferred the word autumn to fall
It’s not goodbye, it’s au re-bois!
Oh shoot, I forgot to lock the back door
Don't worry, I'll catch you when you fall!
I told you we were going to fall.
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs . . . .
YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE A HEAP OF MONEY
SINGING, IF YOU COULD ONLY REMEMBER THE WORDS
TO "THE FALLING LEAVES"
I've seen it happening all around me, like for weeks, but I somehow couldn't get my head wrapped around the idea that it was going to happen to me.
After we land I’ll meet you at the gate.
I changed my will to request I be composted.
Awwwww, Fudge!
I will now leaf you alone.
I hope I'm a crunchy one!
Pray for me to come back next time as a leaf higher up on the tree.
I’m autumn-ing.”
“Use Fall like everyone else.
Time for me to leave, but hang-in there, baby!
...but I miss you most of all, my darling, when autumn leaves begin  to fall.
Give Clora and Phil my best  regards
You've always been the procrastinator in the family.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into 
     the past...           At least that's what I heard."
I'm leaving you--get it?  Leaving as in 'leaves'--get it?
What did he say? Pride comes before the...
The restroom lines will be awful.
I'll leave you forever.
We were best buds.  Now I am leafing you.
'Leaf' me alone, Leif.... !
Time for me to leave.
We had a good run hun.
I'm going to make like a leaf and leave.
I promise we’ll be together again soon. Meanwhile tell that bark to keep his distance.
Are you just gonna go with the wind huh?
I spy with my little eye something beginning with Cccccc"
I'll see you in the underworld.
I’ll be lost in the pumpkin spice abyss
Don't know whether I'm falling for, at, with, by, near, before, or after you. I'm trying to give you a preposition you can't refuse, but I'm out on a limb.
Quick, what’s your twitter handle?
Goodbye forever!
no.  ... falling leaves you alone!
Oakay, I'm leaving you to become more grounded
Don't remarry!
Looks like you’re the last one to “leave”— get it?
Meet you by the car in an hour or so, ok?
In my next life, I hope to be a twig or a branch.
I used Wifi to call UBER
I'm leaving you! Calling me a stemhead was the last straw.
I'm falling for youuuu ....
Last one to fall is a rotten egg!
remember,we are impermanent!
Watch out for those leaf blowers!
If you hang on, you may make it to spring, bye.
It's not you. It's the lure of the Stihl.
You're really gonna blow me off like that again?
Always remember,I love you so mulch!
Trust fall
Don’t...
leave me this way.
I hope you join us before the great leaf blower comes by.
And to think I was just starting to fall for you...
This time of year, I fall for you all over again!"
Hang in there. I'll see you in the spring!
It's true about me and Leif. Forgive me!
Damn!  Just when I was starting to fall for you ...
Don't be attached.
I'll never leave you.  I'm blushing because I'm falling for you.
I tried hanging on as long as I could, but it's time to leaf you.
I thought I was funny, but you always seem to get the last leaf
OH NO, don't leaf me alone
What's the use?
This "fall" is due to leafage!
You do understand we're expendables for Johnny Mercer and Roger Williams
We’re just too much alike, and I’m not getting any younger!
See you in the fall.......
I hope I blow into Canada.
Never change.
You'll wait for me, right?
Hey, don’t leaf me!
I gotta blow.
Oh, Henry!  You're the last leaf.  Someday there will stories written about you!
So long, Russell.
Good bye Harry, sorry I burned your eggs this morning.
I enjoyed our brief acquaintance.
I'll see you on there corner of Maple and 3rd.
I’ll see you on the corner of Maple and Third.
It’s a breeze
I hope I can land on that Nissan down there.
I'm leafing you Martha
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
Deciduous"  yeah it's clearer but can you define link with Fall and NY Giants again?
After spending so much time hanging with you, now I'm really falling.
Quick, hold my stalk.
I’m going to get batteries for the smoke detector.
Just don't go com-postal, ok?
You outleafed all of us.
You're our last hope. Don't leave!
That's the last time I take someone's advice about trying Equinox.
Well, gotta go. See you next spring...
just hang tight... wait until they rake the rest of us up and think they're done
I can't leave without telling you that it was more than a summer fling.
No....I don't want to leave you!
Last man hanging! You won!
Okay, I'm leaving now.  You can have my sap.
You always want to be the last leaf.
If I fall for you, I’ll lose myself
Tell us what happens in the World Series.
"We perish by the trillions so they can see 'lovely fall foliage' - avenge us, my brother!"
I never wanted to leave you.
I thought you said you would do this together!
I've fallen for someone else.
I hate to leaf you!
Finally ,Im giving up being clingy .
You want to stay up here until spring. I like the crowd.
I'll be waiting for you.
-Sorry, Mr. President, I think we all saw this coming
- You didn't quit, I fired you
Well it’s been fun, but I’ll have to leaf you now.
Sorry, I hung out as long as I could.
Our debate's over.  It's fall, not autumn.
No, I’m not ready to leaf!
At least now I can forget my oranges.
I fear the end is near
Play dead when they jump on you or you’ll get incinerated.
I'm mulch now!
You fall, I fall ... right?
Sorry to see you leave
I'll be right back after I see what's going on.
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
I'm turning over a new leaf
Nice being your neighbor, but I really must leave.
You better come now or we'll never find each other in this mob.
Sorry to leave now, see you soon!
I guess it’s my time to meet The Rake.
Don't worry, I won't even touch the other leaves.
I'm sorry we had to end this way.
Sorry, babe, but I was born to ramble.
Oops, guess I’m a peeping pooper.
Don't leaf me alone like this!
You win. I guess.
It’s nicer up here. Less tumult and craziness. Let’s stay.
Last one on the ground has to rake.
The falling leaves drift by my window..♫, la, la, la, laaaaaa...!
It was great knowing you.
Sorry to be leafing you,but it's Fall.
I think it's time to leave. You ready?
I think I’m falling for you, Autumn.
I‘ve put this off for far too long, I think I’m falling for you...
Leif, c'mon please, we'll be asses asses if we don't fall down.
I know you prefer to say, “autumn,” but that doesn’t stop the fall.
It's only temporary. See later. Same branch. This spring.
I lived my whole life for this?
Well everyone else went,but falling leaves me wondering why.
Don't Leaf Me This Way....!!
Why aren’t you crying?
For goodness sake, leaf me alone!
Q predicted this!
Hey! I've just twigged why they call it Fall.
Look me up on Instagram
Why do we fall, Master Bruce?
I’m going to drift by that window
See you next spriiiiing!
And, in that moment, ChloroPhil discovered the meaning of Fall.
At last I’ll know…..Compost or Fire?
Don't let them mulch me.
Sure we're beautiful,but for how long?
Don't worry, I'm off to my mystical magical tour!
Good bye, Maple.  It was lovely being next to you this past year. I will never forget our summer romance, the storms we weathered, and your wise counsel and support throughout this erratic, windy, tempestuous fall.
It's easy!  You just let go!
I’m trying to think of a stupid play on words that, as usual, the editors will think is the funniest caption. Maybe I should turn over a new page.
'Don't worry, I'll leave you a spot next to me"
Cu next summer.
Alas, dollink, I must leaf you!
Wait—I can see a tunnel...and a warm, bright light...  I hope they were kidding about the rakes and bonfires...
If I was in L.A...
Last leaf standing is a rotten egg!
Damn, How I Hate the Fall.
You go first. I’ll FALL-ow.
Not it!
I said, “I’m leaving you!”
I wanna free fall out into nothin'
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
I'll be looking for you at the other end of a rake...
Want anything from the shop?
Aw man, right at the peak of my tan.
Jack: Never let go.
Rose: I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
I had to let go. Bye!
If we make it back up here I’m buying a solar space heater.
I had a feeling this day would come!
See you down the road in the pile-up.
See you Larry. Drop by real soon.
Why are you hangin' on? We're all gonna die anyway.
There is a time for green and a time for brown.
It was great hanging out with you but now it’s time to LEAVE
Tough luck, they say the bigger they are the harder they fall
I'll twist and turn for you, but I'll never fall for you.
I keep trying to "Rise Up!" but some days, I just feel like floating down.
Will you quit calling me "Bud", already . . . ?
Oh, why am I falling down?
You promised you'd never leaf me!
One day you'll make the leap too man.
Wilson!!!
First leaf: I don’t know how to swim...
Second leaf: Are you crazy? The Fall will probably kill you!
I always knew you would make me fall for you.
Jump! It’s OK ,they don’t burn us anymore.
I told you autumn doesn't mean the beginning.
I'm off - see you in the compost pile!
You can talk to Mr. Trunk if you'd like, Mick, but he does this to every branch.
Baby I hate to leaf you, please don't rake me.
If I could I would
I had to let it go.
I can't beleaf this !
Even though it's called "Fall" I'll be the last one to leaf you.
Meet me in Montauk!
I told you we should have done more to fight climate change!
Who's having the last leaf now?
I am too young to die -- this is just the autumn of my life.
You should take this personally
Oh No!! I don't want to leave you all alone.
I’ll be waiting for you so we can decompose together.
Enough of this Golden Groove Unleaving, Margaret!
Don't ever say "how's it hanging?" again!
Here I go again...
Oh, thank goodness. I'm afraid of heights!
I’m falling.”
“Well, it is Fall!
Goodbye Darling! This is my turn.
Remember....you're the one who asked me to leave.
It's been fun, but now I have to leaf.
Exfoliation is such sweet sorrow.
I’m sorry! The executive branch is just not for meeeeeeeeeee...
Why do we fall for this every year?
Don't worry baby, I'll be right bac
We're already late! You don't have time to change back into your green or red outfit. The brown looks great on you!
No, I can’t “get over it”.
Free at Last!
It's 'halitosis', Greg. Google it!
It was nice being so close to you, but I'm about to turn over a new leaf.
I thought you'd never leave!
:You scoffed when I said "no leaf is an island"
Don’t believe the hype, just let go!
"I'll find you after the Fall."
I’ve been meaning to say that I’ve been falling for you.
This feels like it’s just moving way too fast for me.
Dear, we knew the day would come when one of us would have to go first.
I’m a Leaver. You’re a Remainer. It was never going to work for us.
Well, if that's the way you feel, no need for me to stick arooound.
Why do I always have to be the fall guy?
You're the last one and our only hope.
Is it true what they say about the living envying the dead?
I always knew she would leave me.
Oh dear here I go! Remember pal stay positive
I'll save you a place on the sidewalk, dear.
I only have one-way ticket?
You hang on.  I'm going with the rest of the crowd.
How did you hang on to your job as branch manager this long?
Sorry, time to leaf.
Don't do it, Dave! You have so much to live for!
Wait here. I‘ll just be a minute.
Did you just fart?
This is actually perfect timing, I was about to ghost you!"
Meet up in the mulch!
This  time  of  year, I  turn over a
new  leaf!
I'm falling in love with you Autumn,  but alas...I must leave.
'"I'm free, I'm free, I'm free at last"
I feel like we didn’t get to hang out enough.
How did we fall apart?
I'll tell the kids you say hi.
It's goodbye, then. I just don't have the staying power.
Okay. Noon tomorrow we meet for mulch.
Stop being so dramatic. It's not even that cold.
I think I'm falling for you.
FAAAAAAAAAALL!
Good-bye, cruel world!
At last, I know love!
Didn't  you go first  last year?
Hope to see you again shortly after the fall or sometime during the Fall
Every leaf will tell you :
Beware the fall...
This was not in the training materials.
Leaf it to me to take the fall. Good luck buddy.
Ah, well.  Been waiting for the fall.
Why is it only apples that don't fall from the tree?
Help! I am falling and most likely will not be able to get up!
At last we can find out what the future holds -that's a re-leaf!
See you on the street, my brother
I can't leave.
Be strong, honey. The time has come for me to leaf you.
Come on!  Let go. It must be good for no one has ever come back.
You'll be able to find me on the lawn...I"ll be wearing a polka-dot necktie.
Man, you’ve changed.
It's too late, ..., I'm leaf-ing you!
I guess I'll see you on the other side, where the grass is greener.
Aaaahhhhhhh! Sh#t!!!
I'll be fine. Everybody knows it's the reds that give the best crunch.
See, I told you at the beginning of the year this would happen.
I have to go but we'll always have last summer
Wait a minute-where'd the zip line go?
I am completely falling for you

Avenge meeeeee!
I'm taking my leave now.
.  .  .  .  .  .  don't know where don't know when .  .  .
But I don't want to branch out...I can't leaf without you!!
You're definately not least!!
Feels like Fall.
Falling for you, only you
Remember, Bruce, when it’s your turn, go towards the light.
I cheated on you with your brother"
Darn! I  thought I would make it through the Democratic debates!
I am ready to meet my Raker. Whether my Raker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.
Jeez, do I smell bad?
What sucks is I'll never find out if the Yankees make it to the World Series.
I don't want to die a virgin, Rhonda.
Uh oh. I think I'm coming down with Past Peak.
Here I GO! I'm sorry we never had sex !
We're the collateral damage of a leafy suburb.
Cannonbaaaaaaaaaaaaa *takes breath* aaaaaaallllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, Henry!
Not again!
Actually, never mind.
Never forget me john, I’ll always love you.
Oh god, this is just like that Michael Douglas movie. The one where he falls down. I don't remember the name but it's where Michael Douglas falls down. This feels just like that movie where he falls down. What was the name of it?

Oh yeah, Ant-Man!
C’mon, we have a pact!
When you get to the ground, text me.
I never thought I would go before you, darling!
Bye, Clara." "Bye, Phil.
My father was a rake.
You always were the least prideful among us...
Okay, okay, you win the O'Henry Prize this year.
You have my blessing to love again, ahhhhhhhhhh
I wasn't going to get swept up in all this!
No after you.
Let’s continue the conversation in the mulch pile.
I just can’t help falling for you!
...And Carl!...Don't forget to feed my fish...
Noooo, don’t leaf me.
Parting is such sweet sorrow . . . "
Don't leave us all hanging
I had no idea your twig had a faucet.
You can have my chlorophyll supplements.
Fall was always my least favorite time of the year
Leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again.
I told you we should leave earlier.
Rose, I think there may be room for both of us on that branch.
Ahhh! I had a few more colors left in me...
I'm sorry I won't be able to make branch with you tomorrow!
You too. YOU'RE FIRED!
Oil see you in the afterlife.
My life sucks!
I get let go every time around this time of year!
See you at the bottom !!
If  you Leaf me now....
Fall is a synonym for Autumn until it becomes an antonym."
I’ll never forget our time hanging out together
'You were the first to turn on me!
Why couldn't it be you?
I'll see you on the other side...of the street!
Your turn to fall.
I'll see you down there then
I think you finally figured out that I am going to fall for you.
Really trying to branch out this fall.
See you in Boca!
There's no easy way to say this.  We're just not meant to be together.
No. You go first.
I always hate falling in with the crowd.
Oak up,man! Stop being such a Pine.  Come on, we're gonna get RAKED!
Wait until you meet the leaf blower
I really felt we were starting to get to know each other this year.  I hope I can see you in the spring!
Am I going to lose my face, too?
Under the hood, I'll live forever.
Now I understand why they call it Fall.
I should have known it would end like this.
But I don't want to leave without you!
I've got to leave now.
Goodbye dear Friend, I'll miss you!! OOOoooooooo . . .
If I end up in a deep pile, just call Rudy
I guess this it, buddy!  Time to make like a tree and leaf!
I'm leaving you. I can't help it, it's what I am!
I finally know why it's called 'autumn'
I told you it was getting windy
Same time next fall?
Lief, please don't leaf."  (sic
I'll swan dive. Watch.
I hate to leave without you!
This year, me and the wife are aiming to dodge that whole composting thing.
It’s you and me against the world
I am truly sorry about our falling out.
This is just like The Titanic.
Make sure you fall on your backside.
Looks like I’m gonna be the fall guy.
Don't leave me! I meant it as a noun.
Your stubbornness just blows me away.
Tell the kids I love them very mulch!
See you on the other sidewalk.
See you Jack, You're one in a billion.
I'll write when I get work.
Something I said?!
I'm not sentmental. Just hanging on for dear life.
But all my friends are doing it!
'Tis the season, Benny... Give up.
"Hang in there, I'll be back next fall."
This is a falling economy.
I said DON'T blow me.. no, don't... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Face it, Larry, everyone leaves you.
Have I overstayed my welcome? I’m not ready to leaf
Now I know how it feels to be a moderate Democrat.
Falling because I Love You!
Just because all your friends are doing it...
Now you’ll never know the answer, my friend
No!!!! I don't want to go down there. People are crazy.
You and your - oh great, it’s pumpkin spice latte season!
I'll return"
"That will be a re-leaf
But I've always said, 'Better never than late!'
Stop by when you're in the neighborhood.
Leaf season always ends too soon.
Breaking up isn't so hard to do after all.
I can't help it: for humans, it's spring... for us it's the autumn when we fall for each other!
I didn't see that paradigm shift coming.
Wait! I have motion sickness!
I love you so mulch!!!
(Singing)  “But I miss you most of all my darling, when autumn leaves start to fall...”
I knew you couldn't keep us together!
Sorry bud, it's time for me to leave.
Not if I see you fiiiiiiiiirst.....!
Sorry to be leafing you! Hope you enjoy your alone time before the reunion down there.
Sorry to leaf you all alone
I'm hoping for a plastic bag over a fire.
My time has come at last
to join the "Leaves of Grass"!
I didn’t wanna give in to peer pressure, Jerry, but I’m staying here with just you.
- You said you would never leave me...!
Well, it's time to turn a new leaf Larry!
I guess i'll see you next fall
I’ll never forget your sweet caresses.
Time to make like a tree and scram
Ahhh! It still startles me every time.
"Remember, we leave separately and then reconvene as molecules in the compost heap later this winter. No one will ever know."
Sorry to leaf you high and dry, buddy...
I’m not flaking, you’re just being stubborn.
It was nice hanging with you, but ‘to everything there is a season’.
I always thought I would be the last to go.
I'll be right back.
Alice, as far as seasons go, this has been the best. Sorry, but I got to leave now, nature is calling.
I really hate to leaf you!
Sorry, but I must leave.
Bye, honey, just going out for a quick one with the guys...
Sorry to leaf you!
Okay. I’m ready for hospice.
I never thought I would end my life in this dreary orange
Tell the buds I love them!
Hate to leave like this, but see you next fall...
President Tree has assured me that we are valued and protected.
See you in the great street sweeping truck on the road!
Leaf my wife a note.
Time to play the fall guy for Mother Nature
....and, enjoy the rest of your time.
Just look at the bright side.  We'll be looking up, instead of down, and the fall won't kill you. Promise.
Loved hanging around with you through Summer.
I be-leaf this is goodbye.
''WILL YOU SAVE MY SPOT?"
Rake! Rake!
As Edna O'Brian correctly said "This is how it all ends"
See Ya!
This fall is so long!
But I thought we were special!
Brother, try to hit the same spot.
They all say you come back in the Spring as an acorn.
We were hanging on...now the Fall will kill us...
If that didn’t just confirm the basic tenets of Darwinism, I don’t know what will.
I hope your fall is going well.
You may simply see me as your latest fall guy, Donny, but watch me flip hard on my way down!
I can feel myself falling for you.
(humming Bon Jovi) "Livin' on a prayer"
Feeling dehydrated so I'm gonna lay down for a while.
Okay, summer is over, enjoy your winter vacation and I'll see you next spring.
I am so falling for you.
If you go sailing down, I'll be the last leaf.
You say that every fall.
You're the last one standing, kind of.
What did you win?
But if the Santa Ana winds push me farther, know that I'll wait at Times Square till I'm crumbled. Then, make your way to Second and C Street..."
Fall into savings at ColorfulFoliage.com.
You were always the strong one.
I'm afraid the future is not very bright.
Don't leaf me to fall!
Sorry, but I have to leaf you like all the others.
Your doctor is only offering you chemo too?
It might be autumn for you, but it's fall for me.
Alas, Fredrico, it is time for me to leaf!
Freddy: see you later in the shredder.
Sorry to leaf you. I have fallen for another.
Please mom, don't send me to college with those bums that are well below my intelligence level.
Anyways, it was starting to become a boring conversation.
Hang in there, Sidney.
I hate to leave so early but I’ve got to fly
ROSE: I love you, Jack.

JACK: No...don’t say your goodbyes, Rose. Don’t you give up. Don’t do it.
Stop the lyrical autumn drivel. I'm dying here!
Is this what they mean by peak fall?
I think we should break up.
I must leaf you now
Tell Mom I love her!
Have a nice trip.  See you next fall!
I regret I have but one leaf to lose for my tree.
So worry to "leaf" you alone.
I’ll see you in soil
You only leave once!
I thought you said you were an early adopter...
Sorry to leaf you alone bro...see ya' next year.
Don't wait for me!
Find me on the other side!
Remember me, my love
Always the last one to leave.
Baby, it’s cold outside, let’s play like a tree and leave!
We’ll always have spring/summer.
Where is O. Henry's 'The Last Leaf" when I need it?
Any way the wind blows ...
Well, here goes nothi'n...
bonzai!
Mortality sucks but this drop will be very cool.
I think I’m going to leave.
I dont know how many times I have to tell you to leaf me alone!
If I'd known this is what destiny meant, I'd never have agreed to it.
What do you mean you love someone else?
We trained all summer for this moment!  Remember: float, don't flop!
I know this guy Bob, if you wait too long you'll get mulched"
I'll call you when I get to Tulsa!
Don’t forget to rake!
Goodbye Gladys. Thanks for the time we spent together in the summer.
I’m so sorry, but I have to leaf you now...
‘’How do you like my guitar imitation?”
Well, time to go south for the winter.
I thought if we moved to England we would survive ‘Autumn’.
Hang on! I beleaf in you.
Repent! Repent!
There IS a town compost site,isn't there?
Sorry, gotta leave now...
Oh, my, I am about to leaf you behind.
Be sure and look me up when you're in the neighborhood.
Help! I'm falling and I can't help.
Don't forget to bury the seeds.
I’m sorry but it’s time to turn a new leaf.
Don't let me fall!
Hope we end up in the Smith’s mulch pile.
Fall-ow me!
Apotosis and gravity may pull us apart for the moment, dear, but soon we'll be together in the hereunder!
Actually, I wish I could spend more time at the office.
Now I see why people call autumn "fall".
We'll be back in a few months
Oh no I think I’m falling for him, again!
I'm having a hard time dealing with my survivor's guilt.
I told you we should have made reservations.
Fall as in follow
It seems more like a Poisson distribution.
Corporate said it’s fall, but come on.
Now that we're alone...
It's a trick. Don't fall for it."
''Hope to see you next season lookimg fresh.
Hang on. It sounds like a pneumonia cough to me.
Evade the rake!
Oh, dear.  I knew it.  Pride cometh before the fall.
I think I'm going to fall hard for you.
I never told you I have "Fear of Flying"
If it's any consolation, they'll die too.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Oh oh i hear johnny mathis singing
THAT song.!
C'mon, nobody's going to write a story about you coz you're the last.
My one and only look for me.  I will be waiting for you.
RIP CORD?  I DON'T HAVE ONE!
To hell with the anti-aging creme.
Martha, I can see the old homestead from here.
See you when you catch your wind.
So much for all my vibrant color.
I think we should start seeing other leaves.
You promised you would never leaf me!
I always knew I would take the fall for you
I am a conformist therefore I am.
You were a great neighbor. I’ll miss you.
'till fall do us part"

-Willa Ehrlich Kurtz
Rhinecliff, N
May only have 6 to 12 months before I turn into compost, but I will spend them a free leaf!
You promised to let go with me!
See you in Lauterdale!
Oh no !!! There goes the spring in my step !
I didn't think you turn on me!
Guess who I'm calling for?
I don't know why I waited to fall this year.  I guess I just wasn’t that into it.
...and that's my case for impeachment!
Now I know why they call it the fall.
My therapist said I should detach.
Oh now, I didn't see that coming!
Why do the call it Fall?
Leave it to me..
I guess this means we aren’t hanging out after all.
I guess the chlorophyll treatments didn't end working!
Goodbye, my love
I don't like how you've changed. I'm leaving.
Man, I wish I had a parachute!
Hold the fort while I'm gone, my good buddy.
I've tried dear! Oh how I've tried!  But I'm afraid this is goodbye!
Did I tell you I'm falling for you?
I told you there were three seasons!
I know I said I'd never leaf you, but I'm fall-ing...
Goodbye old friend.  I held on as long as I could.
Alas, falling in love was not enough.
I guess this means you're leafing me?
Ever wonder why they call it Fall?
You know  I always give in to peer pressure.
I hope we can get together again next Spring!
Live the rest of your life to the fullleessst
Oh, oh, I'm falling in love again........
See you soon.
Yeah, you're just like Maxwell House: good to the last drop.
That’s what you get for singing that Queens song constantly.
I was going to keep hanging on, 
but then Congress issued a subpoena.
It's been nice knowing you.
I leave you my branch: You always looked better on it than I ever did.
I know, I know. You don't have to tell me. It's Fear Of Missing Out.
Technically, this makes me a first responder.
See you in the compactor
Tourists everywhere these days.
Parting is such sweet sorrrrrrrrrrowwwwwweeeeee
FOMO....YOLO...it’s all the same to meeeee!
I leave, but falling for you, sustains our spectacular season, until we can colorfully compost together !
I know I’m one of the few, but I hate the fall.
I'm not leafing you, I simply want to branch out.
I'll see ya, Benny. It's time for some tortured wordplay.
...and I thought you said fall was only a noun!
I'll wait for you on the other side of the pile!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart	 
 	Absent thee from felicity awhile,
 	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,	 
 	To tell my story."
-Leafle
Congrats. You get the million bucks
Do we have to?
Yes, I bought the leaf bags.
i’m scratching fall from my bucket list
I’m just going to the store, need anything?
Perhaps I am being trite, but I am also being honest: "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”
Bye bro, I’m fallen out, which leaves you the last leaf to fall this fall.
I will find you..... If it's no to windy.
I’m not falling, I just can’t stand you anymore.
Stop your sobbing! You're the one leaving me!
I hate to leave you like this, but misery loves company.
None too soon, I take my Leave.
I'm totally falling for you.
My attorney has the will!
Sorry, I  can't hold out any longer for the impeachment.
Are you leafing me for the winter?
I know it’s crazy, but I think I’m falling for you!
Maybe I'll see you again someday.
As in the song: 'We used to live together;
You who loved me, I who loved you
But life separates those who love,
Slowly, noiselessly."
Well, I'm leaving now.
Stop being so stubborn, there's a reason they call it Fall.
Don't forget to call me before your flight!
Let it go, let it go—
I am one with the wind and sky
I'm leafing you, Charles..
Stay well, I'll see you in the Spring again...
Maybe I'll see you again after the fall.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I guess somebody had to be the LAST climate denier.
All these many months, I've been wanting to tell you how much I lo... oh, snap!
Goodbye, or perhaps it's Au Revoir
Oh no I'm falling, George.
I'm glad we finished our estate plan!
I hope I land outside of the border wall. They don't use leaf blowers there.
Byeee. Tell mom I’m sorry I couldn’t hang around.
Join us Comrade...
I’m really falling for you....
Sorry I have to leaf so soon!
I’m goin’ in!
Wait!  What do you mean, 'It's not how we fall but how we pick ourselves up again?'
I can’t help falling for you.
I'm leafing you. I need to branch out.
Hopefully, I'll see you next year...
I hate to liter.
Finally on my own!
You were a great fiancée ... for 90 days ... maybe I'll see you in a plastic bag soon.
Oh no!  I'm falling.  I hate to leaf you.
See you in another life,
brother...
Tell my family I love them."
Promise to write!
I'm starting to get concerned about climate change.
This is my chance to see the world.
[blinks 3 times]
I hate to leave now that I've fallen for you.
Wait, don't leave so soon.
Come on, everyone can fly on LSD.
That's it for me. I'm for the rake. Rustle while you can.
I guess I won't be candidate for the 2020 election...
Come with me so I can finish telling you about last night.
I just never thought it would happen to me.
It may be too late, but I think I'm falling for you.
Oh No!Reincarnation Again!
It was a great summer getting to know you but I hate the “Fall”. See you on the ground.
I hate to leave you, its been lovely
Hold on dearest Leif.
Sorry to break this off, but I've got a date with the handsome guy with the rake in the two-flat.
It's too late, I had no pride to begin with!
I hate leafing you. Maybe we will meet again on the pile
My dad was a paratrooper but they said I was too green for the job.
See you in hell BITCH!
Ohhhhh......I didn't want to be just one of many.....
I knew you'd love me and leaf me."
Bye! I’ll be joining Marty now.
I've never liked the idea of conforming.
Hey....don’t leaf me all alone!
For God's sake, Felix, you can't just keep floating around like a leaf in the wind!
I thought you said this would be fun.
Well, it's been Nice Knowing You for the year....
But it looks like we need to Split Up...
Cheers
See you in Capistrano!
I'm sorry to leave you but I have reservations at the place we watched blossom across the street.
Ah, if we once go to see them in the city!
Goodbye Taylor, it's time we broke off this relationship.
Noooo! I’m leafing you!
I can't be-leaf we're breaking up like this!
Just give me a little time, I could fall  for you.
...and then he felt truly and absolutely leafed behind
Finally finished my photosynthesis!
Didn't you hear the rumors of coming winter?
Let’s try to be a spruce in our next incarnation.
Last One out of Beech City...
If I see her, I'll tell her to meet you here.
Goodbye, Donald. It’s just you alone now.
We're drop dead gorgeous!
I hope for cremation, not compose.
Dave don't leaf me!
Till we meet again...
Time to migrate “Down under”… the snow!
Why do all my girlfriends leaf me?
Sorry to leave, but  I couldn't help falling. 'Tis the season!
See you next autumn.
One leaf falling from the tree, one leaf falling
See you in the next world
I think this is the end of our relationship!
At least this year John swapped his rake for a blower.
I call shotgun!
Forget about their Autumn promotion, you have to cancel cable.
Don't worry - I'm fine with Salutatorian.  Congratulations!
Reincarnation here I come!
On Oh, looks like I'm going to leaf you hanging.
I thought you said you were falling for me too!
'That why they call it 'fall' is all you got to say?"
No, not that trunk. The other trunk.
Did you ever think, when you were just a sap-sucking little bud that it would all end like this?"
You get the rest of the wine.
Remember to turn off the lights.
Maybe it's the fact that we weren't meant to be that I am falling because of you.
I have this sinking feeling.
Don't be afraid.  Just let go.  You'll just flutter down.  Like this.
Peace Out!
Is this why they call it fall?
It won't hurt when you hit the ground because you will be dead.
I'm leafing you for good this time!
Watch me go down...I am a champion flutterer !
Maine or Florida...?...Your call, Mr. Know-It-All.
No, no, no... billionaires don’t fall!
We never got around to discussing mortality.
I am just “leaving”, and I may be some time.
Remember, don't land near the lawn mower!
I'm not a leaves person!
When you fall flat on your face, don't bother coming back.
I'll never let go, I promise
I wouldn’t hang around this place much longer.
I thought we going on 3.......!
Don’t be a tough guy.  Don’t be a fool.  I will call you later.
Haven't you heard?  It's time for the fall.
...like I said: hold out so you don’t “drop”!
It's just a matter of time now, and there's nothing you can do about it.
I THINK WE ARE FALLING
They are all there but one - I, Chingachgook , Last of the Mohicans
Who knows? The salad days may be yet to come.
Ok, sweetheart, I lied about one little thing: I am scared of heights!
Next year I'm opening a new branch office.
I'd like to say something poignant, profound, or funny, but after so many seasons of the same scene, it's all been said.
Meet me later at "The Mulch".
I've gotta go now. Hope to see you in the compost bin.
I thought I had more time.
But you said O. Henry drew us!
What do you mean you got busy and just forgot? You had all summer to book us a spot!
It’s fall time baby.
No collusion! It was a perfect conversation. I’m not a puppet, I’m a leaf! I must be the worst treated leaf in the history of leaves! This is a witch hunt and they’re gonna burn me...
If all your friends jumped off th--DAVE NO!
There's something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time.
.... is it Spring back and Fall forward - I always get that mnemonic mixed up ...
Every branch has a silver lining
I told you, it's Logan's Run for real!
Tis a far, far better thing I do......
Don't forget, Russell, last one who leaves turns out the lightest.
Come Spring, I promise you that I'll turn over a new leaf.
Well, obviously you don’t want to be part of the fall crowd!
I had a feeling I'd be the first to go.
I am not lief to leave you brother leaf.
OH  MY GOD, I’m going to Fall
I’m leafing you and taking the kids.
See you in hell when they burn us to a crisp.
Sorry, John. I’m leafing you.
I didn't  LITERALLY mean for you to leaf  me alone.
We said on threeeee!
Tis the season for separation anxiety
I think I'll go for a reverse two and a half followed by a pike.
Gotta go now!  You think that's why they call us "leaves"?
The shredder waits for no leaf.
Ugh, I’m just not in the mood to be social.
Sorry I have to 'leaf' like this.
The horror! The horror!
I warned them about climate change.
Be sure to tell Chlora and Phil I’ll see them next spring.
Don't be a lemming!
Don't be scared. After the first big drop, the ride's a breeze.
Will you marry me???
I just can't take your annoying updates any more.  You think you're the only one losing color?
We should have invested in evergreens.
I haaavve chaaannged!
"Don't over think it"
Remember me in therapy
Please promise me you will have me properly cremated.
I know it's the autumn of our lives, but I'm still leafing you!
How did I fall for that?
I think it's time we went separate ways.
Don't forget to lock the door.
You knew I'd eventually fall for you.
This is my gift, this is my cuuuurrrrsssseeee!
Oh no, my stem is showing!
Martha, I always thought you’d go before meeee……
I know I said I would never leave you..
Sorry about the break  up.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
It’s not your fault. I changed.
Now I understand what it means to fall for someone.
Vive la Tontine!
What a re-leaf
I leave you with your reincarnation theory.
Finally, I can leave! I thought the year was never going to end.
Whoa . . . death do us part!
I'm leafing you––and anyway you've always hated my puns.
I'm falling for you and that's exactly why I must leave.
They say it's not the impact that gets you, but rather the heart attack on the way down.
We weren't right for each other anyway.
Never forget that I always thought you were nearly as handsome as I am.
Woooooaoooaooooaoaoaa
I don't care what you say. I'm going!  Whee!!!!!
So Long, old pal. See you next year.
Fine, I'll leaf you a alone!
Let's not get carried away.
I said it's fall
See you in the black plastic bag.
Daughter leaf overheard talking loudly over wind gust.
“For the last time mom, it’s the fruits that don’t fall far.”
OOOPS, gotta go, Dave, see ya in the compost pile.
Next year, we're moving to Pine Street.
I think the Branch Manager just fired us all!"
i will be leafing you now....
We can't go on like this all winter. I'm leafing you for an acorn.
Here we go again. See ya next fall!
And so for some reason, my Millennial parents named me Waldo.
Finally, I have been "hanging" with him for years
I told you to leaf me alone, so now you're alone.
GERANIUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
There's milk and cereal in the refrigerator for you.
Despite Global Warming, I guess fall's still a thing.
Help! I am falling and can't get up.
Shucks, you win!
I’ve heard of leafing but this is ridiculous!
You jump first.
Let's meet here again in the spring.
It’s called ‘fall’ not ‘jump.’ I won’t go until I have to.
Even the leaves fall for you
Confession, I’ve always sailed under false colours.
Don’t worry, you’re going to have a good fall!
If ever I would leave you, it wouldn’t be in autumn
You said you’d never leave me.
Time to leaf, see you next Spring
I hate to tell you, but I've fallen for someone else
So long, Sweetheart.  I'll be keeping an eye out for you!
It's not you. Or me. It's just "fall."
I'll wait for you!
''Good luck with that last leaf thing!''
Dang, I'm older so I should've known.
Heeeeeeeeeellllppppp! I'm going down.....!!!!!!
"Well yes, you're a leaf, for God's sake"
I’m really going out on a limb here.
I hope to be reincarnated as a walnut.
'Near... Far... My chloroplast will go on...'
Come on, it's your turn now.
Let's hope I don't land face down!
I’m hoping for cremation- don’t want to end up as worm food in some mulch pile!
I would as lief go now as later, or is the saying, in my particular circumstance, I would as leaf go now as litter"
Oh it's a long, long time from May to December, but the days grow short when you reach September!
...tell me the one about rats deserting a sinking ship again?
I love you!
... but the word of our God lives forever.
I’m afraid, I have to ‘leaf’ you now!
Hang on Leif.
I never should’ve gone to see “Frozen”!
You said you wood never leave me!"

"Sorry...it's just too breezy.
Too fall or not to fall, that is the queeestiooon.
You think this is bad? Wait until they stack our corpses for body slams.
Some rise to the occasion as carbon we fall…
I'm falling in love again!
Good bye, dear; I do so hate to leaf you.
Oops, it’s now up to you! Remember, that sweet lady dies if you let go!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.......
Wait...you changed your mind about this sky-diving thing?
Well, my breeze is here! Tell Ethel I'm sorry I couldn't hang around.
I'll see you on the other side.
They told us marriage doesn't last forever.
I'll miss you.
I really am falling in love with you.
I’m leaving now.
I regret nothing!
I apologise, but I must leave now.
That's it dear, I'm leafing and you're in for a fall.
I think I might've fallen too hard for her and now I have to leaf
No, it's too soon! There's still so many unanswered questions! Where did we come from? What is the meaning of leaf? Why are we the only two leaves with faces? Oh god, not like this... Man I'm falling very slowly.
I am not falling for you. I have no other choice.
In my next life, I'll be pumpkin spice.
Don’t worry honey. We’ll be mulched soon.
Just call me the answer ‘cause I’ll be blowin’ in the wind.
Oh dear, darling Deciduous, I have to leaf you now!
I'm sorry, Jimmy. We caught you leaf peeping... Our branch has to let you go.
Tell my story!
I'm falling for you. No, really - I'm falling for you. Ah!
Oh the days dwindle down to a precious few. September, November...
No I don't wanna go to counseling, I'm leaving.
Sorry I have to leaf you alone.
But,I did give at the office!
I‘m tellin‘ ya, it‘s just those damn energy saving light bulps. No was it‘s already fall.
‘Stop going on about how beautiful fall is!’
I guess this is why we're called leaves.
It is feeling more like a fall than a ride.
I think we should see other people.
Leaf me your number before I fall? I promise I’m not a rake.
Oh no! Do you think I will still feel a breeze down there?
Act now!  This deal won't last forever.
I’m sure it will be different for you.
Gotta leave. I think I’m falling for you.
Your just like all the rest, please don’t leave me hanging!
I guess this makes me the Lemming.
Ciao, buddy. Drop in when you can.
Going, going, gone.
I really hoped that we could hang out together, but se la vie.
See you in the Spring!
I guess this why they call it " fall."
You just gotta learn to let go, Oakley.
Don't think, just jump.
."Where's Walnut?"
Where do we go from here?  The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind.  Either there or the bottom of the compost pile.
At least they’re soft landings.
They’re going to rake me!
I told you I'd leave you in the fall.
Not sure what it proves, Leif, but your tenacity is exceeded only by your misguided beliefs.
It leaves a lot to be desired.
You come off too,  you , old  maid!
They were right, these autumn colors are bucket-list stuff
You're not even going to tell me to take your hand?
Well, I'll be seeing you around.
...then she said I'm "rakish," what did she mean?
Hey Rose - you let go!
Congratulations Dani, you're the May Queen!
Don’t forget to like and subscribe!
Farewell brother. I am on my way down to fertilize the ground.
I hope I’m reincarnated as a pine cone.
Any last words??
Sorry, I have to go now! The summer with you was great!
3,2,1 Bungee!
There. I’m leafing. Are you happy now?
Consensus does not trump cognition. I'm not following this crowd. Oops!
Wan that Autumn makes its sure arrival,
And puts to rest all that Summer has made glory,
To lead the land into Winter’s quiet cold,
Our glory, we tell first what is to come.
I just found out that composting means death and rotting away. Save yourself!
I had no choice, but to listen.
I'm pretty darn sure I'm falling for you.
LOSS! The universal force!
I don't care what you say - I still think climate change is bogus...
I can't beleaf this, I'm not one of the chosen ones!
...aaargh, this is IT...there can be only one
I meant it when I said, “Leaf me alone!”
You go first. I want to leaf it alone.
This time I mean it, I am leaving you!

Judith Garten, Rhinebeck, NY
Oh no, I'm gonna be in deep compost!
It’s time to leaf you.
After seasons of scrubbing the air of ionizing radiation the only recognition of our contribution will be burial as radioactive waste.
Branxit - taking back control.
Time to say goodbye. Hang in there!
I’m a leaf. Leaving is all I know.
Uh, so, I think I left my car running.
I am falling - don't leave me.
I will always love youuuuuuuu.
I am sorry, I have to leave.
You’re the rotten egg!
Don't forget!  Meet me on the corner of Oak and Hickory.
This summer's been great, will I see you again
Amber! Does this prove how much I’m falling for you?
Quick, come now--we'll fall in love!
It's the Fall of our lives.
Here goes the great "soiling oneself," eh?
The fall really saps the energy out of me
Why must you always prolong the inevitable, you 
just need to learn to let go!
I`m sorry to be leaving you alone.
Leaf this to me, we've got this covered!
Sorry, but leaves gotta leave.
I'm falling head over heels for you
I don’t know — All I’ve heard is ‘Mulch to dew aground nothing!’
Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.
Winter is coming...good luck Jon Snow.
I always knew it would be me leaving you first.
In the autumn, we fall, so I must leaf you now.
I'm a leave, Karen. It's what I do. You knew this when we met.
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far...I WILL find you!
Looks like I'm going to be leaving you now.
I know I said I'd stick around, but this party's winding down.
Be seeing you aground!
I hate to say it, but this puts some finality to our relationship!
Just learn to go with the flow already!
Jack, I told you not to let go!
I thought this was why we rolled over our 401k.
I can’t believe you turned on me!
Help! I think I see an ICE agent in that car?
I'm only ashamed of you when you pick your nose in public.
Like in a good Greek drama this mask leaves the stage and pretty soon Scarlett darling, I will be gone with the wind
I thought we had years before climate change killed us all.
Long after we've gone, they'll still be singing Autumn ...
Thomas Jefferson survives.
'When I said that I was falling for you, I meant figuratively.'
I'll always catch you when you fall.
is hanging on for winter really a good idea?
Its a breezy fall day and my color has changed, my time has come to...go away.
I wanted to be last leaf standing this year!
Hang in there, Kat.
See you in the compost heap.
You told me you'd never leaf me.
I'll never let go, Jack.  I'll never let...AHHHH.
It's time for fall.
We had a great time together, it's nothing personal.
C'mon! Everybody's doin' it!
So THIS is what they meant when they talked about the dangers of climate change
Let's plan to meet at the landfill.
I left you my Roth IRA....
I'll try not to get blown away befroe you arrive.
Hate to leave, but I guess I'm just a conformist.
Next season, Jerusalem?
Help! I'm falling!
Well, O-henry, it looks like we're the last two, so, let's hang on as long as we can !
I never did get my invitation to October's party - did you?
When they said Autumn weather would blow me away I thought
That was simple hyperbole
I don’t think the sanction programs will save us.
I guess this leaves only you.
Quid? nec quid pro quo?
Did I say something wrong?
See I told you this is real sky diving!
Oh no...here I go...off to the whim of the wind, and then part of that Awful mulch pile! Yuck!  Do your best to hang tough, here! "    J K Fuller, Genoa, N
Goodbye.  I never liked the way you hang."
Twinleaf Jeffersonia still lives.
See you from the ground up, Mumford.
Falling in love is terrifying!"
Tell Jenny in HR to send my CV to the Wilsons' hot tub.
I promise, I’ll never forget our summer together!
Let’s make like a tree and leave!
Sorry, my dear. I never meant to leave you."
Don't worry.  We're the chosen.  Remember, only gold leaves get into heaven.
Sorry to leave you in the larch like this...
Fuck yeah I'm dying! You suck.
You have bad breath, Lief!
I guess i'll see you after the Fall
If ever I should leaf you it wouldn't be in Summer
See you next fall!.. wait that's not how this works!
I hope it's a mild winter......
the doc said to lay off the de-icer.
I leave you my precious leaf,
 to join our former leaves. When you leave to join me among our past leaf friends, be sure to leaf through all the leaves so we can be leafs together again.
I hate to leaf you but I really must go...
Speak louder.  I'm breaking up.
So long; see you in The Good Place!
Hang on Phil...for everyone's sake, you've got to hang on.
I'm not falling, you're moving up!
O.K. fine. I'll leave you alone now.
Don’t be on the wrong side of history...Jump!
I hate to go just when our love blossoms.
I forgot to do the dishes.
I think I'm needed on twitter, the owners said they wanted me to come post.
Don’t leaf me behind!
Just remember I was always falling for you anyways
Oh shiiiiiiiiiii.......
So this is it! Proof that we are mediocre like everyone
We’ll always have Paris . . . and Snapchat!
Gone, gone, going!
Looks like you've won "Survivor: Oak Tree". Congrats.
Ahh! I'm not ready to fly the nest and go to the crowded big city!
Uh uh - you get the last man standing prize (good for a few seconds, don't waste it)
Remember — '...fall back.'
Honey, let's meet below and compost together!
We both knew that eventually, I'd have to leaf.
I am going to leaf you now.
Never let go, Jack.
Well this is a down trip
Sorry to leave you, see you next Fall.
I told you not to sing The Guess Who!
Autumn is Russian in!
Why don’t you look down and check out the foliage before we’re all past peak.
I've just fallen for youuuuuuu...
I guess this is what Fall in Love means
After this breakup, let's get dirty and renew our relationship.
It was way passed overdue to step down.
Back to college, Mom.
Promise me you'll go on living without me!!
If that kid with a rake comes along, I’m going to kick his ass!
Oh, true apothecary. Thy drugs are quick! Thus, with a kiss, I die.
I’m going to leave you now.
You must allow yourself to LEAVE.
You have a beautiful voice when you sing the Party's Over
I promise, Jack. I’ll never let go
Don't leaf before me buddy, I'll be all alone up here on this tree!
Well here goes; see you when you get down.
See you next autumn! Wait, I mean—
I think you will become the king of gungle .
Oh no! I was hoping we would go together...
I finally get to see Marilyn
Just like I told you, everyone heads south for the winter.
They're called "abscission" cells. We've all been cut off.
I disagree wit'cha. I'm not just another ignored subpoena!
So much for that "I'll never let go" stuff, Rose.
I hate to leave you. You were always such a rake.
Farewell Leif
Goodbye Dave. Until we meet again!
We always knew it would end this way...
We barely got through our first blush!
I'll find you Lief, I promise.
It's been nice flapping with you: don't get too swept up in the mainstream !
I guess it's a bit late to tell you that I'm falling for you.
Rebecca Hawkins
Fine, yes, I know longer believe EVERYONE ELSE is wrong.  Whatever!
Maybe see you in a compost pile readying for the Spring planting season!!!
Damnit, Lorraine.  Just once, only once, would you let me go first?
Don't be a tough guy.  Don't be a fool. I'll call you later.
I'm just saying, you have a choice. To each his own.
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.
No, baby, please don't go.
(Borrowed from: Peter Cetera - Chicago)
With Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotton as the leads, you should be a shoo-in for best in a supporting role.
Got to drift apart as we get older.
On that crisp autumn morning, Antonio overcame his fear of heights only to realize his fear of rakes
I think I've spoted an old friend. I won't be long.
Supposedly the branches are cheaper in Boise, plus my buddy says I can stay with him
It depends.  Have you prayed?
Remember, I’m the one with the large freckle on my back.
Cordero and Lucas
Ah, you go, too... Why am I so lucky to live forever!
It's time for me to turn over a new leaf
I salute you fall-en soldier
Good Bye Rhonda! I always knew this relationship would fall apart.
loneliness a leaf falls
Oh no I think I forgot to turn off the stove!
I'm sorry! Gravity's argument was just so persuasive!
Sorry you didn’t get a pardon. Treeson is a serious charge.
See you in my next life !
Leaf on for the rest of us!
Dang it! The bet's off O.K?
Sorry,  I really can't  hang on any longer
I know I said I'd never leave you. I lied.
FAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I hear there's a big goodbye gathering in the eves troughs.
Hang in there, O.Henry might write an inspiring short story about you.
I always talk about myself in the third person when I am facing oblivion.
I'm really falling for you, Sharon.
I’ve got to fly Charlie. See you next Fall.
So sorry to leave you like this.
If you're lucky they'll rake the lawns before you land.
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down.
Been great hanging w’cha
Looks like you're the Last of the Oak-hicans
Can’t stop deleafin’, geez I feel like such a leaflet!
If ever I would leave you, it wouldn’t be in Auaaaaa...
I hate to love you and leave you.
Oh, my goodness, I’m falling.
Why do humans go up to heaven when they die, while we fall down to the ground?
Freeeeee falling . . .
Like they say, death, taxes and fall
See you on the flip flop
I will make sure to give George your regards
This is it. I’m leaving you!
The leaf peepers' faces always change color during these autumn traffic jams.
We were leaves in the breeze,never
whispering a word of love. Now with the magic
of Autumn,we have fallen for each other!
I’ll call you on the blower, later.
Well, it's been swell, but I haf to leaf you now.
I always wanted it to be just you and me...but now I have to leave.
Why would I care about reincarnation if I can't remember anything?
Please send my regrets to the tree. I just had to leaf.
Whatever it takes, I will find you again!
last one fallen is a rotten egg
Goodbye! I'll just leaf you here!
You're it!
I guess this is the fall.
Farewell, dear. This is why they call it 'fall.'
This time I really mean it!!!
Leave us alone.
Jack! Jack! Jack...jack!!!
Will humus me?
Because it is our nature....
I don't know about you, but heading south for the winter.
Dude, I'm really blown away!
See you in 5.
See you in the next life!
But I miss you most of all my darling...
...when autumn leaves start to fall
Give My Regards to O' Henry!
Hurry up or we'll miss the 5 o'clock leaf-blower.
I think I'm leaving?
Oh okaaay, I get why they call this season Fall now.
Remember last autumn
Why am I'm leaving you for Russell? Because all you ever want to do is hang around here.
I could really take it or leave it
Live long and prosper!
I thought you said cutting interest rates would prevent thissssssssssssssssssss!
Your first.
I am leafing like all the others !
Sorry. I have to leave.
Looks like it's time for Fall!
Catch you later at the compost bin.
If my Leonardo DiCaprio imitation won't impress you, then nothing will.
Me when I am depressed
Catch me, I'm falling
To each there is a “fall”, good-by,dear, hope to see you soon with a safe landing!
OK, I will leaf you alone
I’m off now.
Try to meet me before the leaf blower arrives!
Sorry, but I have to leave...
Well, I think I'll be off to Florida to winter with the kids.
What a late night...I'll be bagged today
I am not a Lemming! Stop it!
To part is to die. May you compost with me.
Doris, I'm leaving you...
I’m Falling in Love....
Take a leaf out of my book. I've always thought it better to be one of the crowd ...
Autumn: "Phyll, don't leave me!"
I promise I'll never leaf you
Oh NO! Its that time we don't want to fall!!!!
see you on the leaf pile
Ack! It's worse than a falling dream!
Our salad days are calling.
Tell my mother I love her.
Remember to aim for the gutters
I'm not ready to leave yet!
It could only be 85 degrees for so looooong!
So much for being Instagram famous!
Send my greetings to Préveeeeert!!!!
Guess it's my turn...you're on your own now.  Wish me luck.
Oh no! I don't have my parachute!
I’m falling !
See you on the ground
Oh, thank God. I thought I was going to be around for the election.
Goodbye, sorry to “leaf “ you all alone
See you next season...
Attached leaf: Don't leave me. I love you.
Other leaf: Sorry my love, but it's a breakup season. Bye bye...
Fall!!!
Don’t be shy! This is not a touchy-feely crowd.
It's the Republicans...avenge me!
If I land face down, "hmmf hmmmf" means "wasn't so bad!"
It's fall,and I can't stay up!
Plurgee!
More than one fish in the sea!
We, your competitors, salute you. Now beat Trump.
Leaf me alone!"

[Note: I know it's ambiguous which leaf is speaking, but please don't discount my entry because of it. I really need the prize money to pay off this guy Mark who I owe money. He said he'd break my KNEES with a BAT
Just our luck to be part of a conservative tweed coloured autumn.

I always thought I’d be the last to leave...
It's going to be difficult to avoid stepping on the cracks.
I’m falling for you, remember that...
Just the two of deciduous, my ass!
I go to burn in the sacrificial fires of fall.
Your the last hope, Eric.  You can do it, April's just around the corner!
You can do it Leif!!!  Don’t let your fear of heights get the best of you!
Time to go with the wind...may you come back in the next year as better looking.

I’m falling!
I TOLD you I was falling for you.
Pray that the blower turns on him!
We'll meet again in the rake pile!

Follow me on the town’s Instagram.
I’m off to catch an Uber
Let us fall, my friend! For the season is Fall!
You were right, I should have turned over a new leaf when I was young and green to strengthen my core.
Oh no!  I never wanted to leaf you.
Our friendship always falls apart this time of year.
I'll see you in hell.
You said you would never leave.
I'll save you a spot.
Don’t worry — we’ll be reincarnated next Spring. Of course, we’ll still be leaves.

Let's make like a tree, and get out of here.
Nooo! I've been falling for you!
Go!  Go find Mom down there.   I want to apologize for 
all my bad behavior.
Looks like I'm going to have a nice Fall!

There has never been anyone else, I love you....
You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you.
I don't know about you, but  I don't like what's going on down there. I'm hanging on to the very end.
I know you didn’t sign up for this but that’s life.
I lied when I said I could cover deducted annuities.
I love you! We'll be together again...I promise I'll find you...in the compost!
Goodbye, my love. We’ll meet again in the pile.”
I'll see you on the predictable, cheesy art work. Hang in there!

You're still attached?  So much for the synchronized diving competition!
:It's been fun have a good winter".
I just can't help thinking of that sperm cell yelling "I don't want to die! I don't to die!"
That's it..I'm leafing you.
Wow! Wow! Wow!
It's time to leave.
But I always wanted to be "the last leaf".

Trendsetter that I am, I'm actually going to land on another leaf.
I’m turning over a new leaf. See ya...
I don’t want to spend my last few days with you, I’m peacing out early.
Maybe we can go for a drink in the spring.
OMB.  You were right. There "can be only one."
Why do you think they call it fall anyways?
Goodbye Mitch.
Last one there is a stinky caterpillar!
They wouldn't say it but I'm just going to. It IS you.
Leafing you is bringing me down.
It was wonderful as it lasted, but I always knew it couldn't  last forever.
Curse you, Autumn!
You were right...because I never turned over a new leaf, i'm going to end up in the gutter!
We will always have Paris.  Remember that
Well, here's to hoping our next life is more profound.
You're old enough to become more grounded.

Land on me, if you can, there's a chance of frost.
Well, I'll take my leave now.
Remember your parachute landing fall training!
Next year I get the view of the Japanese Maple.

I can't help falling in love with you.
After the wonderful spring and summer we've had together, I'm falling for you... please say 'oak k'.
I never thought you would out leaf me.
The answer my friend . . . confound it damn wind.
Woe, destruction, ruin, and decay;
The worst is death, and death will have his day.
Sorry, I just can't hang around any more.

“No!...Wait!...What?...We’re mighty AND deciduous ?”

I always knew this relationship was bound to have a falling out!
Hey man!  See you at the Rakin Rave!  I hear it's bonkers!
We both knew this could never last.

I feel like I'm preprogramed to do this.
Nothing bad is going to happen.

We’s the last two leaves
We all have to go away someday.
. . . and I've got plans for a spin-off . . .
I fell for you.
We can try to return as pine needles
I'm leaving now.  Don't wait up for me.
Fear not! It's just like riding a bike
(if us leaves rode bikes) . . . Tally Ho!

Why me?
I've always loved you!
Those are the breaks.
Sorry to leaf you alone, but I'm free falling
I’ll always love you Harriet.
Call me when you're down to hang out..
I never told you I'm afraid of rakes!
At least we gain an hour of sleep when we turn the clocks
Look for me in the compost pile!
I'll never let go, Jack.
Come on... everybody's doing it!
Your fall is coming too.
I'm leaving you, Alice."
The Drama of Fall
See ya next Spring, Steve!
Oh well. See you next season!
Tell mom I’m leaving.
Martha, my dear, it was a wonderful Spring-Summer romance, but it is time to break things off and fall our separate ways.
Finally, some peace and quite !
See you in the mulch pile!
I was going to say "Geronimo!" but that's inappropriate. So...I'll see you down below!
Take care of the kids!
I'm sorry, but I only wanted a summer fling.
Bye for now. I'm looking forward to seeing you 
again next spring.
Leaving is so hard!
Remember when I said I would never pun you?
Remember, I got dibs on the gutter!
It's been a lovely summer, enjoy the fall !
To be compost or not to be compost, that is the question.
I think I might be falling!
I've had it. I'm leaving.
So sorry...but it's time to leave...
I'm leaving you, John. I want to pursue my freedom like the others.
Don't forget to drop me a line!
Here we go again...you are the last to survive!
This is 
goodbye to my fair weather friends
See you in a bit.
Tell Lamina I love her.
Now I know what fall means!
I now know why they call it Fall...
Well, I guess we know who's off first.
I hate to leave but I will see you next fall.
Aaaaaaaah!
After the Biles II, it's just over and over for me.
It's time to drop off ... the last leaf-collection truck passed by this morning.
See you later.

What can I say? I have FOMO.
See you at the compost pile
I don't want to leaf you!
I told you to leaf me alone.
You win the $2500 prize in the Survivor pool!
Some day we’ll reconnect on Ancestry.com.
Well, it was a 50 50 chance anyway.
We're autumn leaves, man, it's what we do, bonsai!!!
Maybe the great tree will forget, if we all beg and coax and fret, and tell him, Orange is In. (with apologies to Susan Coolidge)
It's October, we've changed colors, I guess this is good bye.
If I nail this half gainer, we win the meet!
I hope we don't fall for this routine!
Goodbye my Love! Till we hopefully meet again in the great compost pile by and by.
Who in the world decided to call it Fall?!
I guess this means Summer is over and we have to die now. Leaf is so unfair!
Where's my lightbox?
I know I said I'd never leave you...
Let's meet at the curb.
Did it again...we're always last to leave.
I have to go. We've both changed a lot recently and we have just grown apart.
Don’t hold your breath.
Family reunions really make you realize who got the short end of the stick. Just look at those guys.
Help! I’m autumning!
B-bye.
Oh no, it’s got me!
I don't get it, can no one pay the tree its rent?
I guess it's you and me for the last dance!!!
I always thought we would have more time - it's not my fault!
Nice hangin’ with you —but seems I have to Leave...
Carousel! Carousel! Goodbye Logan 5!
See you after the fall.
Hopefully in our next lives we’ll be trunks.
Uh-oh. Is that the sound of the breezes that blow?
And now, I must leave.
I think I'm falling <3!
Sorry.....I'm leafing you.....
I can't hold on any longer!!
That snap leaves you, it does not look good Icaris.
Turning over a new leaf is not going to be easy.
Look, I do love you, I just need a little space right now.
FALLing and I won't get up
Looks like it's time for my big exit line: "That time of year thou mayst in me behold / When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do haaannnggg ..."
I'm not like those others - I'm falling for YOU.
I certainly don't feel like a new leaf.
Climate change, schlimate cha-WHOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHH!
I'm not falling for this one again, Janet. I want a divorce.
Stay close.
Why do they call it Fall? Oh.
Goodbye; see you next time in your SECOND TIME AROUND.
You’ll be next, Mudbloods!
I can't explain it, I'm just falling away.
Well there goes cousin Alice.
Time for a nice back scratch.
That's it! I'm leaving the Family tree.
I really wish it was strictly called Autumn
This frigid wind is giving me brain freeze. It feels like Mr. Fucking Freeze’s monster ice cock stabbing me in the back of the throa- ahhh ahhhh ahhhhhhh! I’m falling! Ahhhhhhh!

Suck my leaf dick Dave. I always hated youuuuuu.

Steer clear of the vehicle Eric! The Stevens boy is in there “burning trees”!

SO SAD TO LEAF YOU

It's been a while, my friend, . . .

Here I go...see you on the other side!
Well color me green.
This is it, Ed!  See you on the compost pile!
We’ll rake it in yet, you’ll see!
You said no one cares about you... now  look at all these guys falling for you!
Time to take my turn getting crushed by kids: faith.
Please tell the buds that I love them and to try to hang on until Spring.
It's fall time.
Don't stop be-leafing!"
You hanging in there for the late fall?
It's time for us to separate since marriage isn't for us.
I THINK WE ARE BEING LEAVED BEHIND!
You said it was not a problem to go out on a limb.
I’m afraid of commitment!
So far, so good.
You're always the last to fall!
You know its fall when the whole tree leaves
Oooh! That one got me.
I've become a conformist in my later years!
I’m going to try and land on that car’s windshield..
Help me, I'm autumning!
I'll never forget you Marge.
In referencing the current season, I much prefer the word autumn.
So sorry my dear I have to leave you for now, but we will be together real soon with our pile of friends.
Looks like your going to have to leaf it alone.
Do you wanna go first?
I'm a non-floater!
Jack said, "Rose, I must leave you now, but promise me that you'll survive and your heart will go on."
This time will be different!
I never said 'forever'...….can't you leaf it alone?
I hung on as long as I could. See you on the ground.
I’ll see you on the flip side!
we're twins!  you have to jump.  NOW!
The beauty of FALL for them...is death for us!
Wow, all the leaves have fallen and it’s just the two of us still up here.  Could it be that we have mouths and eyes? Plus all the other leaves are of different colours from us. Does that make any difference? It ought not to make any!
So long,it's been good to know you.
It's Autumn, I leaves you now.
Yikes! I’m not ready yet . . .
I said I'd never leave you, but....
You said you would follow me if i jumped first!
Everyone 'leaves', you have to learn to let go!
I’m sorry I have to leave you.
There is no shame in letting go, you said...thanks for nothing!
Gil, I need to tell you something
I think I’m beginning to fall for you.
Goodbye Oka.  It's been great hanging with you.
Ooh-wee, Marie. Shake it, shake it for me.
Lose your blues.  Everybody's cut loose.
Everybody cut. Everybody cut. Everybody's cut loose.
I always preferred the name Autumn.
One day you’ll have to branch out too!
I think it must be global cooling....last year I lasted until November!
I can't hang around much anymore.
You said you’d never leaf
I’ll text you from the mulch pile.
Climate Extinction Rebellion were right! Arrrgh!
Before it's too late, just know that I love you.
I really enjoyed quaking with you.”
Don Dechman, Austin, T
Sorry I have to leaf you like this!
If you leave me now you'll take away the biggest part of me
I'm falling for you, will you catch me before I land
If ever I would leaf you . . .
Never let go," Jack said to Rose
I will see you again in the Spring, but can you make sure you record the latest episode of Succession?
Tell the saplings not to miss me
Promise me you'll survive, Rose!

Anya Laurence

What part of  Leaf me alone do you not get?
I did the best I can, but I guess I'm fired
It's called climate change, get used to it.
Well its been nice hangin in there with you. Wish me a happy landing.
Why didn't I turn over a new leaf when I had the chance?
I'm autumning
I hate to take leave of you.
Oh! Now I get it: "Fall"!
Oh Oh, Hope we meet again!
Remember me before I become VSCO famous.
When time stands still.
What happened to "You Jump I jump"
I'll see you in the landfill.
Did you get wind of what's happening?
I'll miss you!!
My winter break starts today.
Tis the season that we fall, old bud.
I would never have imagined that one day I’d be just a statistic.
Nooo...dang, you win...
Sorry to leaf you, it's been fun .
You stay and entertain the leaf 'Peeping Toms'.  I'll meet you in the compost heap.
I knew it couldn’t last
Last chance, Oakleaf.
I'll wait for you at the bottom.
I know you’re right behind me, but I’ll get lost in the crowd. I’ll never see you again. I don’t want to go first!
Goodbye, my dear. I must be leafing.
I hear the compost pile is really warm this time of year. Care to join me?
Please, leaf me alone, I know I have an f/v speech devect!
You are the DEFINITION of a leave-behind, Becky.
Do try to hang on thru' the flu season.
I guess it's just you and me, Babe.
Leaves just fall in fall, they don't have such expression and face
I'll be down there to cushion your fall!
HE WHO LEAVES LAST, LAUGHS LEAST
You know what they say...the first will be last and the last will be first!
Time for a rotten job.
I hate winter!
You’re the winner. I am going down!
Sorry to leave you alone.
Everybody else has departed. Looks like it's time to bid you adieu and take my leaf..
I'm sorry! I held out as long as I could.
I can't believe you're leaving me all alone.
But you promised never to leave me!
I told you we should have bought life insurance
Oliver Wendell Holmes knew what he was talking about
Goodbye Sweetie, sorry to leave you like this!
I'm going on annual leaf for the holidays.
Pride cometh before the fall!  
Wait...I thought that was summer.
You say Autumn, it looks like it's Fall for me, and the rest of us!
I will be leaving soon.
I know you've heard this before, Harriet, but I'm really falling for you.
Stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you!”
“Don’t be so dramatic Fred. Just aim for the bush.”
I hate to be the last to leave.
U oh, I'm falling!
I'll wait below for you to leave
Pardon my Shakespeare, but I had as leaf we could have spent a few more nights together.
Sorry but I am leafing you.
Come on, let's make like a tree and .....never mind.
Leaf Titanic
"I'll never let go, Jack. I'll never let go."
I'm going to look for some acorns.
Promise you'll wait for me!
This may be an inopportune time to admit I''m falling for you
Farewell, my Love. We'll meet again in the mulch of Sir Robin's nest."
So much for turning over a new leaf.
When I get there, I’ll wait for you.
I know it's a bad pun, but I'm leafing you.
If you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.
Sorry pal but their playing blowing in the wind
Lots of tree jokes and puns come to mind, but just leaf already!
Why can’t autumn jut leave?
Bombs away, Kevin! It was a GREAT season. Hate that it's over. See you in the piiiiiile. [Exits downstage]
I’m leafing you now Maple.
This leaves so much unsaid between us.
Well, Hamlet's 'undiscovered country' looks good and plenty discovered to me, bub.
I miss you most of all my darling
I hoped we would grow old together
I'm going out on my own. I'm tired of constantly being out on a limb!
I'll get back to you.
Don’t let the kids see them rake me.
I swear, I never meant to leaf you!
Remember: take a left, then a right, then ... no, wait...
I know he’s a rake but I can’t resist.
And this is when I don't like Fall.
Next year we will be reincarnated as crocuses!
Tell my branch I love her!
I will wait for you forever!
Oh snap, here I go - hopefully you find me in the pile up. Don't leaf me alone...
I believe your loneliness as an adult is a reflection of your narcissism and inability to admit when you need help. That’s why I too am leafing you.
Now I get Autumn Leaves
We’re protesting the climate change. There’ll probably be bonfires.
Hang in there, it's just a breeze away.
See you later after the next breeze comes through!
Sorry to leave you. I hope we can share a branch together next spring.
Now I'm your fallen star, you brute.
I am about to fall. Fall with me.
Hang in there! Johnsy is counting on you!
The worst part is the noise of the leaf blower.
We gotta move; seems like this neighbourhood is on a downward spiral
I must leave you now, but remember I'll be waiting for you on the corner.  Just make sure you don't land in the gutter. . . I love you.
See you soon in the compost bin
Sorry! I just hate being left out.
Hasta La Vista
Oh, Leif, I'm falling for you!
Turning over a new leaf for climate change
If ever I should leave you ... it would be in fall.
Oh, no! You can’t leaf me!
Don't be distraught, I'm only taking a seasonal leaf of absence.
Try to hang on until you turn red.
Autumn again; mulch ado about nothing.
I hope to see you in the next life.
I said I'd never leave you, but who can fight nature?
Im in no hurry, the guy who rakes is always late.
Don't be a fool...don't be a tough guy...don't fall for this conspiracy!
Farewell my friend, I hate to leaf but, it is that time of year.
I promise to never peep again!
You're hanging on for all of us now...
I think I might be falling for you !
Moving on, is a simple thing, what it LEAFS behind is hard
Why me, Lord?
Heading South for the winter.
Be-leaf me. I'm still Falling in love with you.
I’m not much for fads, but sometimes you just have to let go.
Help Oaki Wan Kenobi, you're our only help now!
Lucy, you‘re the last survivor - you must tell future generations of our downfall!
Sweetie, remember our vow: 'Till autumn do us part.'
We hung together as long as we could, Delores, but frankly we're falling apart.
Have to leave you, Brownie
Let's do mulch!
Honey, this is no time for "leaving" puns!
Someone stole all my depression meds. Whoever they are, I hope they are happy" 
Mark Taubert, Cardif
This is why the season is called "faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal"!
Just hope that maybe we'll have a child this spring.
Overstory schmoverstory.
Why do I have to fall first?
It’s a deep, dark secret which I’ll tell you next spring!
So NOW you tell me why it's called 'Fall'?"
As much as some folks love it, I’m never quite ready for The Fall.
We agreed — no pilates, Gerald!
And so begins my slow decent!
Oh no, now it's happening to me...aaaaargh
Leaving now.  Look for me in the pile.
I'll meet you there.
And then this guy comes out with a big rake and ..
...I guess we were destined to part... after all, we’re not evergreens...
Hang in there, but I've got to leaf now.
Thanks for hangin' out with me, Leif.  I remember those days coming up the cambium together, watching the acorns grow, then go, I'm just feeling too wistful to have the last laugh.
You can blame nature.
Just remember to avoid the lawn mower
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you, you” la la l
I always wanted to fly.  How about you?
Leafin' my best life!
My stem is tired.
It  must be fa- l ---l.
This Autumn Leaves hooey sucks!
So long, son.  I know we’ll meet again on that great Poplar in the Sky!
This is goodbye,Betty. I'm leafing you.
Goodbye my friend, let's hang out again next year.
I'm ashamed to say it, but I'm leaving you for a rake.
It's too late for me, but damn girl, you got a phat stem.
I  think next time I want to be a fig leaf.
It's the blower or the rake ... what's the difference?!
Doris, we have shared this branch together.  Betwixt us, through spring, summer, my feelings have ripened and grown. At long last I’m ready to ask you out, at winter’s edge, while we still have time this FAAAaaaaaaa....
‘For a moment I was brilliant off off Broadway.’
I hate to leave so suddenly.  It looks like we should expect a long fall ahead.  EarthMom.Org

It's getting back up that's the hard part.
So long, friend. See you on the other sidewalk.

See you later down there in the after life.
TO
We'll see if He's right about life after depth.
Who said dropping in is c choice?
I have to split, that's my ride.
Dude, before you go I just wanted to let you know your mustache makes you look like Stalin. FYI.
...and remember, try not to fall face-first or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life!
I'll wait for you, but don't be too long.......

I'll be your Leonardo DiCaprio if you'll be my Kate Winslet.

It was nice stalking with you.
Unrequited love.
I'll let you know what the answer is.
I'm gonna make like a tree and...leave
Gotta go now. See you in the spring.
I’ll see you in the spring.
We call this  time of the year  Fall , because  we inevitably lose our   connections &  Fall.

Free Falllllllll...... !!
This maybe a May to October romance has been unforgettable.
I am a leaf with a face falling from a branch. You are also a leaf with a face, but you are not yet ready to fall.
Alas.
... and I was so looking forward to the election.
But I never leaf home without it!
Sorry man, that's just gutter humor.
I guess you won the tontine.
See you in the spring ... next year will be our silver anniversary.
You too are leaving to join others in the nether world, as we all must....
But I miss you most of all my darling...
Remember me fondly in the autumn of my life!

They've banned burning us…why do I feel like I'm surrounded by flames?
I'm just going out to get a pack of cigarettes I'll be right back
But you're the one who wanted the open relationship!
It's been nice hanging with you, but I have to Leaf now
Oh, I am so sorry to have to leaf you alone.
Want to flip to see who goes last?
Goodbye my friends, but hello to the WORLD!
No I’m not a follower but it’s time to move on.
It is no use hanging on any longer. You gotta let go sometime, Marty.
I feel like Jack in “Titanic”
Fred, I'm leaving you.
Let go, and let god.
‘Til death do us part.
I still think that Logan had that coming to him for setting up Kendall!
I...oh no - I thought we were better then them!
Vallombrosa, Vallambrosa. You keep talking about us being leaves of Vallombrosa but we don't live there.
I'll take the rake over the rack any day.
Anyway the wind blows, I’m leafing you.
We had a good run up here. I'm done, see you in the sewer.
Sorry, don't mean to leave you twisting in the wind, but I gotta fly!
Meter's run out, gotta go,

See yea later.
Seize the breeze!
Thankfully, this will not be, not this again.
Thats it Bill, It is time to call the season Fell

Leaf it to me. See you on the downside!
Let's Fall in Love
There is no indisputable proof for the big baaaaaang!
I swear I’m not flakey!
Now I get to test out my wingsuit.
Goodbye, Russel.
i don't want to loose my face.
I'll even throw in the car if you move now. That's my final offer; take it or leaf it!
Time to go. See you next year.
But you PROMISED me you'd never use the f-word!
There goes Joe. May he RIP.
You’re on your own. I’m not falling for that.
Jump! The trees are ablaze with color!
Leaving now. Please don’t be late again.
We haven’t got time for a waiting game, so let’s go drift past some window panes now.
Sorry, but I gotta leave. My Uber's here.
I'm leafing you for my second family!
Don’t leaf me here alone.
I'm falling. See you in heaven.
bro,I'm 'fall'ing
Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again.
See you in compost
I’m blown away by how long it’s been since Gary raked the yard.
You’ll never change
Last one there is a rotten egg!
Humpty Dumpty had a great Fall because of a miserable Summer, I now wish to do the same.
Earn it.
Of course you didn't get the invite on Facebook - I told you we switched to Wechat last fall
Gotta go now.  Better dead than red"
Come on please! It’s not fair! How ‘bout Snapchat?!
You say our family is falling apart, but maybe you should try to be a little more grounded.
Do you think we'll fall too?
Promise, not to leave before real impeachment, please...
The color may be glorious, but there is no drama in the end.
It's been a long summer, I'm outta here.
Uh-oh!  Hold on for your life!
It was nice sharing a branch with you, Ryan
Leaving Oakland is easy. Getting back is tricky. Write when you land!
You will never be one of us!
Bye!
Confines of a dark trash bag gets me down.
Oooh Sh**t
May we meet again, my sweet leaf, inside the rake...
But I never saw The Godfather!
Ahhhh! It's nobody's fault but my own. I was looking up. 
You were here...it was the nearest thing to heaven.
Do you think reading us that bedtime story about the lemmings has anything to do with this?
I’ll see you in mulch ‘cause that’s where we’re both going
I much prefer the winter, spring and summer.
See you soon   I hear they are sending us to a warm weather destination.
Relax? Easy for you to say. If I stop swimming, I die.
Oh shut up! It seems like a pretty nice fall!
I thought wood was going to be harder than life!
Your better than just a snow flake.
Everything's going to be  just fine.

Like it would have killed you to ask him for directions.
Don’t bring a camera, you said.  Just enjoy the experience, you said.
Oh, shit! What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?
He just walked by like he thinks we don't exist.
Unplug" you said. "Leave the phones in the car" you said
He asked that we please wait while he gets his camera or his friends will never believe him.
He said it’s not him but he gets asked that all the time.
He walked past me like I  didn’t exist.
He asked for us to wait here while he gets his camera.
Oh, so first he doesn't exist and now he's flirting with me?
Once and for all, Bob, stop following us. It’s over.
He wants us to wait here while he gets his camera. He doesn't think think anyone will believe him.
He doesn’t believe in us either.
He says we're only allowed to take blurry photos.
He said he didn't believe in us either.
He acted like we don't even exist.
He said he doesn’t believe in us either.
Oh, he says he doesn't believe in you either.
I believe you owe me a dollar.
"Leave the phone in the car,"  you said!
"There'll be no time for photos," you said!
Before you meet my family, there's something I need to tell you.
Would it kill you to, just once, ask someone for directions?
He said  he always believed we existed.
Yeah, he saw us, but they'll never believe him
He said he's not surprised; he's questioned his own existence his whole life.
He said that he doesn't believe in us either.
I think we should start seeing other species.
We went on one date! How was I supposed to know we would run into him here?
He's a lot less blurry in person.
Still think we should have left our phones in the car Mr. Be In The Moment?
He’s leaving. Apparently he’s late for a summit meeting.
He says he never really believed in us either.
He can't believe we're real. He's going to get a camera.
He was going to come down until I told him who the president is.
He ignored us like we didn't even exist.
'We'll leave our smartphones in the car,' you said. 'Let's really be in the moment this time,' you said.
He said if anyone asks, we haven’t seen him.
Nice try, but I'm not falling for "made you look" again!
Just man up and ask him for directions
He asked us to wait here while he got his camera.  He said if he doesn't take our picture, his friends won't believe we exist.
Sure, Rich, and Santa Claus is right behind you. Now can we please get back to talking about what happened last night?
He's really let himself go since the impeachment. In fact I wasn't sure it was really him till he grabbed my ass
He says the real abomination is your cargo pants."
First person we see in days and you STILL won't ask for directions!
He said there’s no such thing as human beings and no one will believe he saw us.
The difference is, he, unlike you, is evolving.
He said, due to the government shutdown, the rest rooms are closed.
He's going to try 'outdoorsy' instead of 'abominable' in his dating profile
No! I will not "look behind me", and stop trying to change the subject.
He's a legend around here.
It's 2019. We don't use the word "abominable" anymore.
I’m not falling for that “he’s right behind you” trick.
He’s less blurry in person.
As soon as he's out of the way, can you take my picture ?
Sorry, but I was cold, he's covered in fur. It just happened.
I obviously made my decision! Please stop following us!
That guy? He’s a legend around here.
All I said was "I've seen bigger".
I hate it when you won't ask locals for directions.
He doesn't think we're real.
He says he might have the right charger.
He said he was ready to go public, but with the government shutdown, no one at the Smithsonian picked up the phone.
If we could just stop arguing, we might actually see something interesting!
Let’s leave our phones home,” you said
Can't you just ask for directions, he's clearly a local.
Unlike you, I'm fine with asking a local for directions.
No, it is his brother Abysmal.
You and your 'let's experience the hike and not bring a camera'
He’s mature, ruggedly handsome, and not lost.  Owen, this is goodbye.
He saw me but said his friends would never believe him.
SERIOUSLY, he whistled at me, and you do NOTHING?
No, Craig, I don’t believe Bigfoot is over my left shoulder. I believe you have commitment issues.
You never look at ME like that.
Climate change has everyone relocating.
Don't bother. He's lost too.
He doesn't believe in you either.
I told you getting a guide off the internet was risky.
He said he'll come back down after the 2020 election.
He doesn't believe we exist
He said, "I exist. Get over it.
He says we don't exist.
Oh, like we don’t run into your exes every time we go grocery shopping.
For once, can you just admit I was right?
I swear, if you say, "Are we there yeti?" one more time....
Let's get back to nature", you said. "Leave the cell phones in the cabin", you said
He says it's not us..he can't get cell service either.
He said it’s always been on his bucket list, too.
Well, Mr. Know-It-All, it looks like that wasn't fresh grizzly bear scat we've been seeing on the trail today.
He says he will give us each a pair of skis if we sit through a time share presentation.
‘He said that he had never actually believed that we existed before now.’
I don't see why people think being blind takes away from the hiking experience. We aren't missing a thing!
I'm sorry, Todd.  But he just seems better prepared for what's ahead.
He’s blurrier in pictures.
You’re supposed to say ‘Snowperson’.
That reminds me; did you call your Mother?
Jason has really changed since being on the paleo diet.
He said we have to leave. The park is closed.
Quick, give me the grainiest camera you have.
I thought YOU were bringing the camera.
He’s the new Secretary of the Interior.
He’s having a wall built and he says we’re paying for it.
No problem!  He doesn't believe in us either.
No, I told YOU to bring the camera!
Balding, orange hair, small paws, thinks he's the King of the mountain . . . . I'm sure it's him.
Way to go, genius! The politically-correct term is 'Sasquatch-American'!
Seriously! Why is it so hard for you men to ask for directions?!
I trust him, he's a local.
He said to "unfollow" him.
All the brochure said was “Expert Guide.”
No one is going to believe us! The first blind couple to hike to the peak!
No. I was water bottles. You were camera.
Do you still want to meet others matching your DNA?
Why is it always my "stupid camera" when we leave it in the car?
He says since 2016, he doesn't feel all that abominable.
Nobody will believe him when he says he saw us.
That was awkward.
...aloof, a bit abrupt, but certainly not abominable.
What do you mean you forgot to bring the camera?
The Big Foot is not actually his most notable feature.
Great. Today would be the day you forget your camera.
We haven’t seen a soul in days and now, you’re too proud to ask for directions?!
I found our sperm donor.
This is not what I expected when they said we'd have a native tour guide.
Suddenly you look better to me.
Well, at least HE's not afraid to ask for directions.
Yeah, but I never thought I'd see Trump in the White House either.
We're high, but not that high, are we?
I'm not looking at that hairy butt for the next ten thousand feet!
'Let's live in the moment,' you say...'NO phones, NO cameras'.  Wayda go, Brad."
He says he can’t help us because he doesn’t actually  exist.
The old “Look behind you” joke.  Creative Paul!
Would it kill you to ask for directions?
He said time waits for snowman.
Fine, if you won’t ask him for directions I will.
If your goal for today was to make a yeti cry, then congratulations Tom....
He asked me who was President. I told him and he laughed.
Yeah, like I'm gonna trust the guy who needs a pole to hike up this mountain versus the one who's doing it butt ass naked.
He  says he's going to a summit meeting.
I refuse to have this conversation every time we run into one of my ex boyfriends!
I think this ancestry-DNA search has taken us as far as we want it to
No, you said YOU were going to bring the camera.
See, even he asked for directions!
Furloughed. He works in the park.
Crap, he's lost too.
He asked if we'd wait here while he gets his video camera.
He just wanted the WiFi password for the lodge.
He has cousins in Oregon.
Remember when you said my camera would be too much extra weight?
Well, maybe you should treat him like he exists…
Bigfoot doesn’t believe in you either.
He said he's going to build a wall and the valley residents are going to pay for it.
Time in the Trump White House definitely changes a person.
Jesus, Doug, you can't just call someone "abominable"
I suppose you forgot the camera again.
NO, "Are we there yeti?" is NOT a funny joke when he's standing right there!!
I’m going with him. HE was willing to stop and ask for directions.
Why am I the one who always has to ask for directions?
He said he's heading north before there's a wall going into Canada.
He said he'd be right back with a non-disclosure agreement.
I don't care what he is, we're asking for directions!
And Yeti persisted.
He finds "abominable" offensive and prefers "snowperson."
He says it's only another hundred yards to the summit, but that he wasn't expecting visitors and we should give him a few minutes to straighten the place up.
It's 2019 - the correct term is abominable snowperson
His big foot isn't the first thing I noticed.
He said that his mountain is closed because of the government shut down
You stare at his ass for the next 5,000 feet if you like. I'm going back to the chalet
Quick... Grab the camera that only takes blurry pictures!
It would seem more real to me if there were footprints.
That's another "no" for chief of staff.
Too late. He's already signed with Nike.
You and your "Let's leave our phones at the lodge."
Great, the day we decide to 'be present' and leave our smartphones behind!
The Iceman Leave-ith.
He asked that we get off his lawn.
If anyone is acting abominable right now it’s you, Brad.
I was lost. He kept me warm.
I think the acid is kicking in.
You won't believe this, I just saw Steve Bannon in the nude.
Well, I like him.  He doesn't talk about himself all the time.
Why won't you ever ask anyone for directions, Carl?
Don't worry,if it was real it would have footprints.
We get as far away from New York as we can and, like, literally on the first day, BOOM, celebrity sighting!
See, easy. I don't get why you men are so scared of asking for directions.
I don’t think your dad likes me.
He said to wait while he gets his family. They don't believe in Smallfoot.
NO GEORGE, my nipples are hard because it’s COLD!
He wants us off his lawn.
He's Sasquatch, but he identifies as Yeti.
Aloof, yes — abominable seems excessive though.
He’s just run back for his camera - I told him we wouldn’t mind waiting.
Really, Larry? CHEWBACCA?
He wanted to know if we had any weed.
I know, but he says he has wi-fi back at his place.
Wow, and to think all this time the legend has been about the size of his foot.
You had to ask him right off about evolution?
What do you mean, you don't have the camera?!
Now you want to ask for directions!
He said he thought we were a hoax.
Abominable yes, but in a good way.
I showed him the video but he still thinks Trump is a mythical beast.
All he asked was, is Trump still president?”
She's pissed because Everybody thinks she's a male.
He may be abominable but at least he hasn't been complaining the whole trip.
You go first now, I’m tired of looking at his ass
This happens literally every time I forget my phone.
Cool! What's next on your bucket list?
You SERIOUSLY did not bring a camera?
Why?  He makes me laugh.  That's why.
Well, Daniel, if you really must know, he said I could do better.
I'm just dying to ask  'Are we there, Yeti?'
Bro, if you aren't sure, use gender neutral pronouns.
He's pretending we don't exist.
Incredible! He wasn't ashamed to ask for directions.
I could not understand him.  He was talking in Yetish.
I really think it’s time to swallow your pride and ask for directions, Steve.
It's definitely time for the oxygen.
What’ could possibly be more important than what I have to say?!
I know what a Yeti is. It's your mansplaining I find abominable.
The politically correct phrase is "Hirsute-American"
Actually, I expected a female president to appear first.
He said you’re hallucinating, probably dehydrated, and drink more water.
He said to tell Mr. Trump,he isn't interested in being Attorney General!
I asked, “Are we there, Yeti?” but he didn’t even crack a smile.
A picture is worth a thousand words only if someone's husband didn't forget the camera !
He’s upset.  He found out what ‘abominable’ means.
He was really very nice.  All he wanted was a selfie to prove that humans actually exist.
He prefers "Differently-Sized Foot."
The iceman goeth
Apparently "yeti" is no longer politically correct.
I didn't like his altitude.
What happens on K-2,stays on K-2.
Quit being so stubborn and ask him for directions!
He says the restrooms are closed during the shutdown.
I asked, but he's not from around here.
Actually, I'd say more "rude" than "abominable."
Why are you always afraid to ask for directions?
I met him on Timber.
I don’t know why they call him abominable. He’s delightful.
If he comes back, just tell him that you meant to say "adorable."
Okay, Mr. Mountaineer, now you can tell people even Bigfoot thinks you’re a jerk.
He wanted to know if there REALLY is a Donald Trump.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
We got our selfie. Now let's go before we miss the plane to Loch Ness.
He's going to put his clothes on, he didn't know we were up here.
I guess that wasn’t moose scat.
We just had coffee, I swear.
Oh, like your back is any less hairy.
I'm sorry John. I've found my missing link.
Why is it so hard to just admit when you're lost and ask for directions?
How come nobody is leaving footprints?
From now on, I'm in charge of packing the camera.
He makes me feel like a natural woman.
No, he doesn't talk, but he smiled when I called him "Chewbacca."
He thought we were just a myth.
They never believe him, but he's going to tell his friends he spotted us.
And I thought you had a hairy ass.
He just wanted to know if Mueller had completed the investigation yet.
NOW you're telling me you forgot the camera?!
He said: 'You never saw me'
Aloof, maybe, but abominable?
Quit trying to make me look.
Yes, I'm going with him. He's confident, reliable and doesn't carry a custom walking stick!
Well how much would you have tipped him?
He said, "Go back and tell them that my name is NOT Bigfoot, Yeti, or Sasquatch. It's Frank. My name is Frank."
Ask me again in 9 months.
He wanted to know if we had any Grey Poupon.
Dude. Stop asking 'are we there, Yeti?'
YOU tell him he's off trail.
Maybe you're the abominable one, Gary.
Don't you just hate getting passed by someone older than you.
“We’ve been invited up for drinks at six.”
He said he's tired of submitting cartoon captions to the New Yorker and getting rejected ...
He's looking for a open bathroom since the park has been shut down.....
What you see on this mountain, stays on this mountain.
Wow, that was a near myth!
Rob! He was just starting to trust us! “Are we there yeti!?” Really?!
He hasn't seen him, either.
Roger, I'm leaving you. Size matters.
We have to wait here while they review our asylum request.
He says he's building a wall, and he wants us to pay for it.
Nudists have had to adapt to the climate up here.
If you won't ask him for directions, I will.
We both listed "like to hike" on our profiles and he's vegan too.
He said he's going to the summit on climate change.
Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps you're the abominable one, Craig?
I'd rather just follow him on Twitter.
He says, “If you were hung like he is, you wouldn’t wear pants either.”
Yeti persisted...
He wolf-whistled me and you just stand there doing nothing?
And you just couldn't, possibly, have asked him for directions ?
...let's leave our Iphones at the camp site and enjoy nature without any outside distractions."  Well, what a great idea that turned out to be.
I think we are officially too high now.
JUST ASK FOR DIRECTIONS!
I don't believe in you either!
What do you mean he makes you feel inadequate.
He's not coming back down until Trump is impeached.
What do you mean you forgot the camera!?
I already told you, Gary, he’s just a friend from college.
He was asking about the Mueller investigation.
With Jim and Nancy deep in conversation, yet again, the illusive Yeti escapes unnoticed.
Don't look at me like I don't exist.
No, really, Josh.  I think he'd be perfect for your sister.
He says we're a figment of his imagination.
Nice work, now he’s offended. It’s 2019, they are called Abominal Snow PEOPLE.
You know how angry it makes me when you don’t look at me when I’m speaking to you.
Gary, I NEVER said back hair was a deal breaker.
I'm leaving. And yes, Dan, size does matter.
Downwind is not where to be.
I've met someone.
Well, there's a busted myth--he seemed perfectly lovely.
Well if that's how you feel maybe you shouldn't have put "adventurous" in your profile
Stop changing the subject again like you did at that lake in Scotland!
Quick. Go ask if he'll take our picture.
I've been lying to you,Dave. Size does matter.
Jesus Christ, will you stop following me Greg! I’m with Harry now. It’s time for you to let go.
You never liked ANY of my boyfriends!
That reminds me.  My mother-in-law is coming to visit next week.
I thought you brought the camera
A little surly, sure, but abominable?
He said he came down to get his "23 and me" results.
He called me Snowflake, Roger. Are you going to let him get away with that?
He said if you keep whistling he's going to eat us, and I agree.
He said that from now on he'd prefer to be known as 'The Somewhat Ill-Tempered Snowperson.'
YOU ask to take a selfie with him!
I’m not asking for directions! Let’s just follow him, he looks local.
Not to be nitpicky, but I think you're supposed to say, 'Abominable SnowPERSON.'
He says he's not coming down until after the 2020 elections.
Oh just ASK
I said are we there?”He said “Not Yeti.
He told us to get off his lawn.
We can digital detox in February, Stu - Gimme the damned iPhone.
He just needed to borrow my chapstick.
Actually, it's your attitude that I find abominable.
We can still claim First Ascent. No one will believe in him.
And you wasted your batteries posting trail pics on Instagram.
Turns out they’re  not that rare.
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I'm sure the YETI is behind me.  I'm not falling for that line again!
I think we're going to need another pronoun.
He says, no thanks, he's satisfied with his current Internet provider.
Well, there goes the best guide ever. I TOLD you he wouldn’t want to be in your selfie!
You can only ask “Are we there Yeti?” so many times.
I asked him what the conditions were at the top and all he said was "abominable."
That wasn't 'black ice' you stepped into on the way up!
You were right,it is worth it to get a local guide.
Seriously, Chris? Abominable? It's 2019.
He says he eats only locally sourced hikers.
I asked him “Are we there Yeti?”  Apparently he doesn’t like puns.
Good news--he says there IS cell service at the top!
Why do you always have to bring up politics as soon as we meet someone?
Sure, he's abominable, but at least he listens
If it weren't for the snow blindness, I'm sure we'd be seeing something amazing right now.
All he said was that ‘abominable’ is derogatory, and kept walking
I don’t know what he wanted, I don’t speak French.
No Karen, I will not ask him for directions!
Why didn't you ask him for directions?
I guess not everyone needs a $300 European trekking pole, Julian.
A rarer sighting would be you committing to me.
What do I have to do to get you to ask for directions?
He seems more irritable than abominable.
He said a picture is fine. He just needs to throw on some pants and grab a release form.
I'm sorry Brandon, but I needed to find out if what they say about big feet is true
I don't care how famous he is, just ask him for directions
I can't believe you didn't ask him for directions.
He's depressed. No one believes in him any more.
I thought you had the camera.
Go ahead and laugh....you can't even grow a decent mouscache!
Of course you think it’s a ‘he.’
Awkwardly introverted and bit self conscious, but hardly abominable.
He says he doesn't want to be Chief of Staff.
He's not abominable, he's French.
Would it have killed you to call him 'Mister' Bigfoot?
We must be Really high.
Let’s leave our phones in the car,” you said
And I suppose you're going to say this is all in my head too?
Just ask him for directions already!
Oh, Harold. It was nothing, a one time thing. On a totally different mountain.
He's lost too!
Bob, I've met someone.
Abominable Snow MAN"?! Now go apologize to her right now
He said he's trying to find himself
He said wait here, we can take a picture, but he wants to get his hat first.
No, he said it wasn't him.
You’re really going to mansplain a Yeti to me right now?!?!
Surprisingly, he has less back hair than you.
You had to bring up global warming, didn't you?
He's up to 12,000 steps.
When I said bring the YETI I meant the cooler.
Damnit, Jim - you NEVER want to ask for directions!
There! You hurt his feelings...happy now?
It looked like him, but it wasn’t him.
This is the last Airbnb I let you book.
He wanted to borrow a phone charger.
I thought he'd never leave.
Yet he...?  Yet he, WHAT?
This tour guide is an absolute legend.
He doesn’t know we exist either!
He does look like Chewbacca!”
“You didn’t have to say that to his face.
Don't worry... I gave him a fake number.
All I said was, "Yeti or not?" Apparently he's heard that one before.
At least I´m not too stubborn to ask directions.
Since we're lost, this might not have been the best time to share that  you don't believe in his existence.
He’s said I looked nothing at all like my Tinder profile.
There's never a good time to say this, Phil...
I never thought this ancestry thing would take us this far.
I’m just saying, I know he was rude, but Abominable seems a bit harsh…”
It makes me wonder what else I've missed while endlessly staring at my phone.
I'm thinking of stopping shaving my legs.
Oh, now you know better than the locals?
He's abominable, Gary? We've been listening to you whine about your sinuses since base camp.
Are we really going to argue about this now? If it's on a mountain, it's a Yeti, not a Sasquatch!
NOW do you believe me?
Damn it. Quit saying there's a Yeti behind
me because I will not fall for that again and again!
Now we're losing him. You just had to make one more prefrontal cortex joke, didn't you?
Yes, I'm sure those wild mushrooms were fine. Why?
He won't be back. He said that amid the events of 2018 he hardly feels abominable at all anymore.
Well you can't just call someone "abominable" before you get to know them.
'SnowPERSON'
I don’t think he’s going to give the camera back.
He said, "Sorry, I'm a tourist here myself".
I agreed to help him continue the species
Just ask! I'm sure it wouldn't be his first selfie.
Because he is everything you are not!
He said you can take pictures of his tracks but anything else and you’ll be hearing from his lawyers.
Oh my god it's a small world. He knows Sasquatch!
O.K., you win. But I still don't believe in seahorses.
Aren't we supposed to wait until he's far away and indiscernible, before we take a picture?
He's for a free Tibet in theory -- but no donation.
He wouldn’t stop talking about “An Inconvenient Truth.”
So, Yeti's a female!  She asked for directions.
Compared to all the others, our guide is a legend.
He's also moving to Canada.
He wants to go where snowman has gone before.
I don't care if he's your friend... if he's going to hike with us he needs to wear pants!
He says he won't seat us until the rest of our party arrives.
Turns out it's pronounced "Yet-Tie"
You're the one who requested an authentic mountain guide!
Mansplain THAT!
He says we’re lost
It’s nothing like that. I just do his hair.
How was I supposed to know that Yeti is now a derogatory term?
He said "summit" is a noun, not a verb.
Pleasant guy; very opinionated about global warming
Maybe NOW you’ll ask for directions.
Sasquatch? you call a Yeti a Sasquatch? How do you expect him to react?
A little obnoxious but I wouldn’t say abominable.
He said he is not abominable, just misunderstood.
He said a sitting president can be indicted.
All I said was, "Trump."
Stop trying to change the subject...
Yes, I'm leaving you. He's just so comfortable in his own skin.
Amazing news! He's going to get us the wifi password.
It’s not just his foot that’s big.
He said, "No cash, no selfie."
Look at me when I’m talking to you, Harold.
Well, he's cheaper than the last guide and he really seems to know his way around!
He says to walk quietly because they are having a poetry reading.
It's not the size of his feet I found impressive.
He said  the restaurant at the top is worth the effort.
You're not changing the subject, we're going to talk about why it's been 5 years and you haven't proposed!
Well, Bill, I guess this is goodbye.
I don't think so Tom, Yetis are blurrier than that.
You just had to go and mention you voted for Trump, didn't you?
I asked.  No selfies.
He muttered, 'There goes the neighborhood".
Of course—ask the ten-foot-tall male for directions. To hell with my map, right?
Nobody says good morning anymore.
I've hiked the Canadian Rockies but this is my first time in Sasquatchewan.
He prefers to be called Larger-than-Average Foot.
So what if he gets there first?  Who's he gonna to tell?
Now look what you've done! You don't smell so great after 4 days in the woods either. Now go apologize to him!
You know what's 'abominable,' Brandon? Your constant need to deflect.
Neither of us believe in you, either.
His hands are tiny.
I thought you said it would just be the two of us this time...
We can only take a selfie with him if we promise the photo will be blurry and out of focus.
You're always trying to change the subject...we need to talk about US!
The tour book did say that our guide would be a natural climber.
He prefers the term 'Hirsute Snowman.'
Hang on a sec .... he's going to grab his selfie stick.
You could at least have asked for directions!
The first sign of oxygen deprivation is hallucinating.
All I said was I thought he’d be a lot taller in person.
Nevermind that. Why has the cartoonist neglected drawing in the footprints?
Turns out we’ve strayed onto private property.
Where exactly did you hire our guide?
The only thing "abominable" on this mountain is your attitude towards meeting new people!
You're following in some pretty big footsteps.
He says enough already. Both he and climate change are real.
He may be abominable, but you are being insufferable.
"Were you expecting Julie Andrews?!
He says go away. The peak is closed due to the government shutdown.
Of course I didn't look.
Don't be jealous, Dave. How could I know he'd be up here?
It's a North Face onesie.
It’s over Jim, I live on the mountain with Satch now.
I'm leaving you for someone I can believe in .
He threw my walking stick off the mountain and whispered, "No one will ever believe you."
He's not so abominable when you get to know him.
'Abominable' is a slur, Jim. It's 2019.
He says that he'd like to have us for dinner.
Because he's not obsessed with manscaping, that's why!
Two young people doing an activity outdoors without taking a selfie- he said he thought that was only a myth!
Irascible, unforgettable, but not abominable
Jimmy really went paleo!
I found him to be very bominable, actually
Exactly where did you find this guide?
He said we can take his picture, but to wait until he's far away so that it will be really grainy.
He said the Summit Gift Shop is closed but the cafe is still open.
I told him the park bathrooms are still closed.
He asked how the Jets did this season, then just shook his head and walked away.”
I'm sorry, but I think he will keep me warmer tonight than you can.
He’s more expensive than other guides, but he knows these mountains like the back of his hand.
Please stop saying "ladies first".
Well, you dont look so great naked either.
Well, we did agree we'd both see other people.
He said it’s no fun anymore. Everybody’s abominable.
What? All I said was that I thought his feet would have been bigger.
Dale!  Are you going to let him talk to me like that?!
And I was like 'Yeah, right. And I'm the missing link!'
For once, I agree with you - maybe we shouldn't ask for directions.
After you....
No, I think you better use ’they/them’.
I thought you packed the camera.
He says it's a clothing optional peak.
I'm just wild about Hairy.
Next time I hire the guide.
I say we pass him. It's no picnic being downwind from Big Foot.
He says he does not identify as "abominable."
Ugh, it's so like him to show up and then just leave.
Really? All you have to say is that he looks a little bit like my uncle Fred?
You're not supposed to call them 'abominable' anymore.
No!  I didn't have the camera.  I thought you had the camera...
Do you know if altitude sickness can cause hallucinations?
Very funny, you had to ask him if he knew Chewbacca!
Sorry you had to find out this way.
Well maybe he thinks you're abominable.
He said if anyone should be called 'abominable' it's people like us who drink pumpkin spice lattes and drive a Prius."
No,YOU ask him for direction!
That explains all the yellow snow!
Relax, I said no.
So our Airbnb host seems cool.
He went back to get his camera
Did you hear that?  'Tourists!'  The smug ape called us tourists!
Yes, Helen, I'm well aware of what they say about the size of a man's foot.
Apparently, no one has ever called him 'abominable' before.
he said he's making the Himalayas great again...
Of course I didn’t ask for a photo together - he must get that all the time.
He wasn’t the friendliest snowman I’ve ever met, but abominable seems a bit harsh.
You can be pretty abominable sometimes too, Tad.
He wants us to stop yodeling.  He says he is trying to hibernate.
Abominable? Quite the contrary, I found him perfectly delightful.
See?! I told you that your non-stop yodeling was annoying.
Why are you so surprised?  I told you I had family in the area.
Well, that was anticlimactic.”
Why would you assume he knows Big Foot? Don't you know how offensive that is?
I've made up my mind.  I want someone more authentic.
This WOULD happen when we agree to hike without our phones.
He'll be back in a minute - he forgot his phone.
I'm sorry Derrick, this is my chance to walk on the wild side.
A three-way with a Yeti is on your bucket list, Paul, not mine.
He said something about trying to find himself.
No...he hasn't seen one either!
You had to call him Bigfoot? Seriously? This 2019!
A selfie?! You asked him for a selfie?!
Blame the cold all you want, Richard. His was obviously bigger.
"I don't care if you think he doesn't exist, I'm following him."
He says our small one-toed footprints are scaring his children.
You were supposed to pack the camera!
Well, he does seem to know the way, Allen.
I can't believe you left the camera in the car.
Next time, you pick the tour guide.
No, Bigfoot is the one in the forests. Look what you did - now he’s upset.
Thanks to the governmental parks shutdown, even Big Foot is  unemployed.
Let’s respect his self-identification as gender-fluid and use the term “snow-person.”
Dinner’s at 7 but his agent booked a last minute sighting so he might be a touch late.
They're an Abominable Non-Binary Snowperson, Doug.
I think the correct term is Abominable Snowperson.
I guess we'll have to go back. He says the hiking trail is closed because of the shutdown.
I'm sorry, Jason, but size does matter.
He just took my water bottle because it has his name on it.
Sorry Larry. Size matters.
He's right, I have to choose. Goodbye, Mark.
At least HE's willing to ask directions
We're nearly the first blind people ever to climb Everest!
He says he needs to go off and find himself, for once.
He admitted to cranky, but denied being abominable.
I'll tell you what's abominable, Stu.  Your attitude.
Call me in an hour, in case things get weird. Then I’ll have an excuse to bail.
In his case, big feet just means big feet.
He's offended you called him "abominable" because he self-identifies as "adorable."
The only abominable part of this situation is your unwillingness to ask for directions
Don't bother.  Nobody will believe you and it will really screw up your career.
He's not anti-social, he just needs to pee.
You ALWAYS complain when I ask for directions!!
Chewbacca? Seriously, Neil. Get a life."
Well, you finally got to meet my ex.
So now you’re jealous of a man who’s yet to fully evolve?
And that’s exactly why it’s important to ask their prounouns before assuming.
No, Derek, you're the one who was being abominable.
When he goes high, we go low.
He said to make sure the photos of him are really blurry
You’re a nice guy, Doug, but my taste in men has always been abominable.
You seriously asked him what the wi-fi password is up here?
No, I haven't seen Steve Bannon. Why do you ask?
Just this once, could you forget you're a guy, and please ask directions?
We came to a meeting of the minds.  He said to get off his mountain and  I said OK.
I haven't seen Jerry since high school. Shame, he really let himself go.
Bigfoot’s got small hands.
He said we should have called first.
Did he invite us over to dinner or over for dinner?
He isn’t giving us back our cameras. He said he doesn’t want his family all over social media.
I don't care--he's still electable.
Are you lost, too? I’m just following that guy... He seems to know the area.
Yes, Kevin. It’s goodbye. Size does matter.
Let's just ask for directions!
Let him cool off.  Now that he knows people are real he needs a moment to adjust.
Another newby...no gear, no backpack and not even sunglasses.
Why won't you ever ask for directions?
Didn’t the doctor say the altitude medicine could have some weird side effects...?
He said he thinks  WE’RE abominable.
He's just a better fit for the life I want to lead.
I'm leaving you, Henry. If I have to settle for an abominable man, it might as well be the real thing.
He's crude,rude,lewd and on the way up.
I have an idea, lets make him president.
I've found someone.
He wants to find himself.
He says the "y" is silent.
He's going back to tell his tribe we're real
Admit it. We're lost!
You really didn't know 'abominable' is an insulting term?
What do you mean you forgot to pack a camera?
I've decided I'm going with him--he couldn't be more abominable than you.
Yet he what?
You can’t just ASK someone if they’re BIGFOOT!
Well who else should we ask for directions?
I’m not sure what he meant, but he mumbled something about needing to build a wall.
C’mon, he said if we follow him he’ll “make us dinner.”
He’s way less blurry than I imagined.
Yup, turns out it’s true what they say about a man with a big foot.
For the last time, Melvin, NOTHING HAPPENED!!!
He doesn't look anything like his picture.
Well sometimes you can be abominable too, Chad!
He's unimpressed with his first human sighting.
I didn't bring the camera, I thought you brought the camera!
We're just friends.
He told me he identifies as a Yeti.
I gotta go.  My boyfriend doesn’t like me talking to strangers.
Just pack my camera, I said! Just pack my camera!  Even he thinks you're an idiot
Its true what they say about big feet. I’m going with him.
He will show us around, but he said no selfies.
I told you we were too high...
He wouldn’t stop for a selfie. Said he was having a bad hair day.
I won't be needing you now.
He’s more ambivalent than abominable.
I'm going with him. You can keep the kids.
Are you sure the sign said this hike was good for "abdominals."
Call it one more time. He thinks he dropped the phone on this side of the mountain.
It’s not what you think
He’s just a friend
No one will believe you anyway
But I'm still right about Loch Ness
No, I left my camera at home - why?
He says it's available but we have to book through Airbnb.
Wow, his carbon footprint is tiny!
Let him win.
I'm just saying it wouldn't hurt you to be more like him.. strong, self-sufficient, a little bohemian.
So he's abominable. Who are you to talk?
He took a selfie with me, he said to show his friends.
He said it's pronounced 'Yay-tea'.
He's going to go build a wall to keep us out
He says he’ll be back to chat after he gets in his 10,000 steps
He's more of a primate than you'll ever be.
Why don't you ever believe me?
It's your turn to ask for directions.
He isn't real and I am not going to turn around.
He said real men don't use walking sticks.
Look, he gets me and you don't.
Mostly grumbling but I thought I heard something about climate change.
You just will not ask directions.
He says he'll retire when they find somebody who can fill his shoes.
Goodbye, Todd. He may be abominable, but at least he’s a good listener.
You wouldn't believe the things we've seen here since the government shutdown
Yeah, well he's twice the man you'll ever be!
Abominable? I actually found him quite adorable!
So he's a hairy beast, big deal.  He still should say hi when someone says hi to him."
That's Dad.  He'll warm up after you spend time with him.
I told you that stupid wall wouldn't work
You're just not out-doorsy enough for me Gerald."
He asked me if I’ve seen his pants.
He said if we keep his secret, he'll validate our parking.
He's not as abominable in person.
Strange...he kept muttering, 'No collusion, no collusion, no collusion', as he walked by!
You just had to go and talk about his feet, didn't you.
He might be abominable, Brad, but at least he's going to make it to the top
It's obviously much easier without a pack.
Hard to miss....looks like it is true what they say about big feet.
He has really little hands.
No, YOU ask him if he wants to take a selfie.
He wanted to know if Donald Trump was still president.
How would you like to be called the abominable hiker? His name is Dave.
Brett's really committed to paleo this year.
But you complained the last guide talked too much!
No one will ever believe we forgot our phones.
I guess we are on the Evolutionary Path!
He's depressed.  Says he once was at the very top of the "Fake News" charts!
He says he's in the Witness Protection Program.
Apparently people tell him that all the time.
Great...now we have to have lunch with him!
Small world; his cousin was our tour guide in the Pacific Northwest.
Who knew the word "abominable" was offensive?
Why didn't you just ask him for directions?
He's abominable until he's had his coffee.
Shouldnt it be Big Feet?
Is everyone on Paleo this cranky?
He says our big carbon footprint scares him.
You're abominable... He's harmless.
I’m telling you, he’s just the type of outsider the DNC is looking for.
He asked us to tell the world that his feet are proportionate to the rest of his body -- and that his name is Ralph.
You just had to INSIST we didn't bring our iPhones on this hike, didn't you?
He says he goes down to the valley once in a while to check on a B & B and gastro-pub he co-owns.
Either Sasquatch or Yeti is fine. But don't ever tell him his feet are big.
I'm not racist. Some of my best friends are abominable.
I think that's the new one piece from The North Face
You had to mention the feet.
The tour guide really seems at home up here
I don’t care if he’s the last of his kind, if you’re not going to tell him we’re lost, I will.
I told you he wouldn't believe in us.
I DID pitch him. He said he hates the genre,  your co-star idea, and is holding out for a name director.
I want to start seeing other hominidae
Great. Next on the bucket list is Hoffa.
Well, "it" said 'me no do directions, but you follow- have short cut', so Yes, I am sure it is male.
He’s abominable alright but I’ll take that over needy any day.
You call our guide abominable, and you’re surprised he walks out on us?
Call him abominable all you like. I'm still leaving you.
No, YOU ask him.
You’re going to let him say that to me?
I'm invited to a party at his chateau, but I need to 'lose the geek'.
Yet I like him.
The one time you tell me to put my phone down.
Indomitable, abominable - whatever. At least he doesn’t nitpick like you.
They turned him back at the border.
Let me get this straight - your main concern is that I'm incorrect in using the term Big Foot?
What?! He needed directions.
Why can't you just ask directions,Keith?!
He wanted the WiFi password.
He doesn't know how far to the top. He's on vacation too.
The size of his hands and feet should tell you why I dumped you! Or do you want to know more?
Of course we can't keep up with him... That guy's a legend!
You don't need to get all weird about it. I told him I wasn't interested.
I still think we should have asked for directions
So what if he is?  Did you have to call him Abominable to his face?
Quit following me! I told you I’m with him now.
I've been such a fool, Bob. I'm back. Can you ever forgive me?
He may be abominable, but at least he listens to me!
Yes, I asked for directions. We were lost!
They won't believe us if we don't have a selfie.
You're entitled to your opinion, but I think he's adorable.
I TOLD you not to waste your cell phone battery on selfies!
He doesn’ know the way either.
He’s the Deplorable Snowman, and wants to Make Mt. Everest Great Again.
He said that the tea room is closed for the season and the gift shop is sub-par, so I say we try K2.
They were out of Sherpas.
He says we missed a trail marker about a mile back.
They prefer the term "yetx."
He said he doesn't believe in us
You promised, no nude resorts this year.
I thought you said you were bringing an imaginary friend!
You didn't tell me we were coming to meet your parents.
He's a great guide but his people skills are abominable
Like I said, it gets a little hairy near the top.
He wanted $20 for the selfie.
He says he isn't abominable, just antisocial.
OUR relationship is abominable, Bob. I'm going with him.
We're in luck, he said tourists are too salty.
No, I agree with him - it’s your attitude that’s abominable
He's the least abominable thing in my life right now.
It’s over, John. I’m going to follow my heart.
I thought he was with you.
He said he would like to be known as the “somewhat disturbing snowman”
You meet the same people on the way down as you do on the way up.
You and your stupid Dad jokes, no we aren't "there Yeti!"
Says he's headed back to a more civil society.
She says that her children don't believe that there is such a thing as a human.  Would you mind?  It would only take a minute.
He's not so abominable once you get to know him.
It only gets hairier from here on out.
The one time we leave our phones in the car.
Seriously?!  You forgot your camera?
he asked me to join the mile high club.  I told him that was an urban legend.
The one time we decide to leave our cell phones behind!..,
He's climbing every mountain till he finds his dream.
I just feel like you're missing the big picture here.
Will you just ask for directions already!
He's abominable, not deplorable.
He explicitly said "no autographs" and you thought a selfie would be fine?
I’m not saying you’re stalking me but you have to admit it is a pretty big coincidence to find you here on my third Yeti date.
He seemed cold to me.
Abominable, really? You couldn't just call him Yeti?
He’s your friend. You tell him to cut back on the paleo diet.
He says to avoid the latrine at Camp 4.
Don't just stand there, make him give me my camera back.
Yes, Galen, I'm going with him. His empathetic listening skills and his willingness to forsake the negative din of social media are powerfully compelling inducements to cave dwelling.
No, I wasn't flirting with him - 23&me says he's my cousin.
He says the wait for the summit is about 20 minutes, and suggests we relax in the bar.
I guess the Ice Man cometh and goeth.
He was more interesting before he came out.
No, Jason...the $165 you spent on that trekking pole you'll never use again...that's abominable.
Apparently, it IS lonely at the top.
Of course you hurt his feelings! Who wants to be called Abominable! It's Yeti! Yeti!!
He said that  “closing the parks was an abomination”.
You just had to mention his feet!
No, what’s “abominable” is your xenophobia.
How much do we tip him?
He'll be back in a minute. Just gone to get his camera.
I told you five times: the proper ethnic description is 'substantially-footed American'.
From here on it gets a bit hairy.
He is a last minute hire during the government shut down....Parks sent him over....
I don’t miss a thing hiking blind, do you?
I'd say he's pretty terrible, but not abominable.
I thought his feet would be bigger.
He says he doesn't want to hear the good news about Jesus.
Yes, he says they only kill the ones on snowboards
You think he's abominable. I think he's warm and fuzzy.
Dad! You promised you would be nice to him!
He said nowadays he considers himself more woke than abominable
Let's just say that her 23andMe results didn't come back as expected.
I asked him if he was a Yeti and he said ‘Not yeti’.
Why can’t we ever go out, just the two of us, Harold?
He said he's with National Geographic.
Yeah right, I’m not falling for that again
Not to intimidate you, but you have some big shoes to fill.
Abominable, yeti find him intriguing.
Please, make it  stop. He's been singing "valderee valdera" since  base camp.
I asked if I could follow him, but he said he's off Twitter.
Really? I thought his English was pretty good, considering.
Really? You had to use the 'a' word?
Don't be so jealous.  Sometimes big feet mean just that.
Next time I get to choose a guide.
You're not going to believe me, but I think I just saw your ex-wife.
Size does matter.
No pictures. Both of us vowed to be more present this year.
Well maybe you should think before you call someone abominable!
"It's eerie to see him in the wild and not tweeting."
He made a pass at me and you DID NOTHING ?!!
He said he was going back up until Trump gets impeached.
You heard him, Jim. We're just going to stop at his cave for a quick lunch and then we'll be on our way.
You are not paying attention to me.
You were the only one being abominable just now, Steve!
Well if you don’t want me to ask for directions then don’t lose the map next time.
You had to go and call him abominable, didn’t you?
If I have to settle for cold and emotionless, I’ll go with the Yeti.
He's a great guide, but he's not much for conversation.
This isn't what I meant when I asked for a local guide.
That whole "abominable" thing is no longer PC.  Can we just go with "Alpine Hominid"?
When you said we'd have a local guide, I didn't understand just how local you meant.
I said he was evolving. Not that he and I were involved.
Not Yeti was a perfectly appropriate pun.
He wanted directions to “Sasquatchewan”
I can't explain it.  It just happened.
Again, his name is Edwin and he identifies as POST-human.
Wow. I always assumed that Bigfoot was a male.
Next time, you get the guide!
He seemed nice but he didn't know anyone who went to Yale.
'...honest, it's nothing...we're just friends.'
He'll be right back; he forgot to feed the cat.
He says we’re too loud.
What did you say to him?
He'll be right back.  He forgot his phone.
Abominable? No. I think he just lacks People skills. Let's press on.
No, Jason...the $250 you spent on that trekking pole...that's abominable.
He prefers "they" and thought "abominable" was very judgmental
He was mainly complaining about his abominable wife.
Oh God, do you think he saw us?
He wondered why women always have to be the one asking for directions.
Okay, you're right. Everybody goes to Davos now.
He's a local
You really insulted him. Any idiot knows the difference between Sasquatch and The Abominable Snowman.
If you think his FEET are big ...
See what?
He said we shouldn't have spent so much money on Gore-Tex
I asked if we were near the summit, and he said, ‘Not yeti.’
Flip a coin to see whose tent he shares?
'Let's unplug,' he says. 'Who needs phones on hikes?' he says. Bigfoot dammit! People who see Bigfoot need phones on hikes!
Yes he is abominable and you voted for him...
YOU never tell me how good I look without make-up,
He said he's going to Starbucks and asked if we wanted anything.
He seemed nice.
You were supposed to bring the camera!
He said 'No one's going to believe me when I tell them I saw you.'
He said conditions up ahead are abominable.
Everything was fine till you made that manscaping crack.
Are you sure this was the guide we booked on Travelocity?
He said, "Don't tell anyone you saw me."
We met in college. He's just a friend.
Did you think he was abominable? I thought he was sort of nice.
He asked if we'd seen any abominable snow women in the vicinity.
Of course I'm leaving you. Look at those feet.
He's gone to tell all the other Bigfoots that we really do exist.
I can’t believe you’re leaving me for him. You made me shave everything!
He wanted to know if America was great again.
All I said was that we think he’s a myth.
I told you he was the best guide if you want to avoid the crowds.
He may be abominable, but you're just a jerk.
‘Abominable’? Really? Go apologize.
Well let's just follow that guy then, he seems to know where he's going.
It said we're just a figment of its imagination.
OK, so it's Big Foot not a yeti. You really know how to spoil a moment don't you.
'Hire a sherpa,' I said. 'Let's go a little native,' you said.
He was just wondering if my boots come in a 26-E.
He just wanted to make sure that we knew that this is a clothing optional mountain.
I was told it’s a great hike but with all this cloud cover there’s  just not anything that interesting to see.
He said I could do better if I didn’t shave my legs.
This is humiliating for us. I bet he never even trained.
He has to go back up. He thinks he left his iPhone at the summit.
I'm starting to think he's not a sherpa.
He's not the guy. He says his name is 'Yeto'.
We look like tourists.
Can we leave our phones behind and connect with nature for once?"
Good call Marty
What can I say, I have primitive taste.
Bigfoot is a no good, hairy vagrant who contributes nothing to -- he's right behind me, isn't he?
Oh yeah? Well, you wouldn't notice if a Yeti walked by!
Well that was a little anti-climatic. We still don't know the meaning of life.
He’s your uncle; you tell him to put some clothes on.
He mumbled something about "the wall"  and kept going
We need to go back to the crevasse and take a left.
I told him I was looking for a more evolved guy.
Sorry Dave, but you know what they say--big foot..."
Just for once can I ask for directions?
It’s not you, it’s him.
Great. Now we've lost our guide.
You know, he was actually kinda bominable.
I didn't see HIM using a GPS
That was really insensitive, John.
He is going ahead to see if we can get a table by the window.
He's just going to get his camera so he can take a selfie with us."
Calling him abominable Jeffrey, doesn’t change the fact that he’s still  president
I told you not to mention his small hands!
That nice hairy man said he would like to have us over for dinner tonight.
I’m sorry Brett. It’s been an amazing journey, but I just have to follow my heart.
You're imagining things.  I'm not seeing anyone else.
I can in fact confirm that we are standing downwind.
I'm sorry, John.  I have to follow my heart.
Yes, the Ice Man has cometh.
Is it possible that we are in a car insurance commercial?
Don't wait up.
He called me an abominable human being!
He said he thought we were unsubstantiated sightings
He said we could post a photo as long as we don’t tag him.
You know, it’d be a lot easier to find Bigfoot if we weren’t blind.
He was hoping we could give him directions.
Here's my idea: you follow him while I leave.
I’m going with him, he doesn’t need to stop all the time to ask for directions!
Of course he’s upset. ‘Sasquatch’ is a slur! The proper term is ‘Hirsute-American.’
I told him that we already had plans for dinner.
That reminds me. You need to go in for another back waxing.
Sorry, Jorge, but size does matter. A lot.
He said to count to ten and try to find him again.
Yeah, I'm freezing, too! We should have sprung for the PolarFleece Xtreme suit like Gary did.
He could have asked for directions. Yeti didn't.
He said our footprint is bigger than his is now.
Can you believe it? He acted like he doesn’t even know us.
He just said "Yeti, set go!" and took off.
He said if we wanted a guru, we've climbed the wrong mountain.
For the eighth time, it’s abominable, not abdominal.
I haven'seen him since college.
What do you mean you forgot the camera Brad!
He said he wants a guaranteed $655 per day, $2,272 per week, 3.6% of distributor's gross receipts for television/cable, and, for video discs, 4.5% of the first million sold and 5.4% thereafter. Call his agent tomorrow when you are ready to sign.
OK, have it your way. You saw a yeti.
He says we're trespassing.
I  wouldn't bother going all the way up. He says its lonely at the top.
He's a little touchy about the A-word.
At least he listens to me.
The heart wants what it wants.
Good bye, Grayson.
I'm sorry Ted, I'm leaving you for a real whatever he is.
More like the apathetic snowman to me
See, even Sasquatch will stop and ask for directions!
She got offended when I called her the Abominable Snow-MAN
He's not exactly abominable...more like an antisocial climber.
We talked, and yeti, yeti, yeti, we're engaged.
Got anymore mushrooms?
He says that they're building a wall but we'll have to pay for it.
When you texted, "Yeti digress," was there supposed to be a comma?
He said, “get your camera out, you’re not going to believe the view!”
Oh really, Carl? What's more likely, that Bigfoot's standing behind me, or that I'm very high and we're standing in a Wendy's?
That's just great, Tom! You can find an imaginary snow beast but you still can't find the courage to get me a ring.
He said we're overdressed.
He's twice the man you'll ever be.
I'll tell you what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to go back down this damn hill and tell everyone I saw..."BIGFOOT"!
Closed, and he is on furlough.
He knows a great ramen place.  And there's no wait."
I told you. He's sick of hearing about Trump.
So many doubt his existence--he just needed to feel validated.
Due to climate change, we're seeing a lot more yettis this time of the year.
He’s really not much for conversation but for 50 bucks, he’ll let you take a selfie with him at the summit.
He understands me. That’s why!
I 'm sorry Hans, he's just more equipped.
No internet connection! There is no point to any of this if we can't post it to social media!
I.m leaving because at least HE isn't going to spend years figuring out if he wants to go back to graduate school or finally start a family.
He might be abominable but at least he's willing to take our relationship to the next level.
next time...I pick the guide!
He says unless he gets the wall he's not coming down.
Melania finally did divorce him
I can't help myself, Stan. There's just something about Hairy.
What did you expect after draining the swamp?
You could've asked for directions.
Really? This mountain, this light and you want a picture of HIM?
Ask him what the Wi-Fi password is.
No more arguing, I'm asking directions
Well I’d walk away too if you kept calling me abominable.
He will send us the selfie once he gets better reception.
Footprints, no I don't recall seeing any footprints.  Why?
We see celebrities all the time in New York, what's the big deal here?
I'm pregnant.
So What.  It's fur, and I want it.
Oh, he was just asking if it was 2020 yet.
Well, did you really think he would help after you called him abominable?
Sorry Jerome, in this environment, size does matter!
Yes, Michael, for the umpteenth time, I do think our guide does know what he's doing!"
You just had to use the A-word, didn’t you?
And Yet . . . I no longer find him abominable.
It's pretty hairy going up.  Coming down not so much.
Look, he's local & says he knows a good coffee place. I thought we agreed to 'not be tourists' on this trip...
He's pretty upset. He said he spotted me but no one believed him.
He said he can't wait to tell his friends he met a real compassionate conservative in the wild.
What? All I meant was, proportionally, his feet aren't that large.
No one ever mentions the abominable snowballs.
We’re wasting our time. I haven’t seen even one footprint.
No, not a word. Just the cold shoulder.
For the last time - don't call him that. He is very sensitive about his foot size
Of course he’s upset! How would you feel if I went around calling you ‘big nose’?
He insists he’s not.
He said we should close our eyes, count to 100, then try to find him.
...But you had to have a no phone rule!
'Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints,' was NOT what I was expecting.
Thanks, Brad, I'll take it from here.
I know how you hate to ask for directions. So I asked. And he said “follow me”.
He says the media spin has gotten out of control 
and that he's really only an 'untidy' snowman.
He my be abominable but he still has feelings.
He's as lost as we are.
Don't ask don't tell.
Yes! Fondue at his place...and you said the locals were cold and distant.
I'm not saying we've been climbing for ages, but he was entirely clean-shaven when we started.
Larry I’m sorry ! Size does matter
He called US the abominable ones.
We dated in college.
You know, it might just be the altitude.
Well, now I feel overdressed.
This tour guide is unbelievable.
It's okay. He said the mountain is "clothing optional."
I guess it's true what they say about big feet.
He said dinner is at 7:00, and 'all paleo' is just a stereotype.
Stop interrupting!! For you, there's never a good time to discuss our relationship!
Jimmy, I'm sorry, but you know what they say about big feet.
He says he gets that a lot.
At least he knows where he’s going...”
Apparently, mistaking Yeti for Sasquatch is a no-no.
He said, "Don't eat the yellow snow."
He said that Donald Trump is a con man and its obvious that he had conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election. He's optimistic because he can see how sharp and tough Nancy Pelosi is and he hopes to see the entire Trump family put in jail.
Please make your father put some pants on!
Do you think he'd take our picture?
He says he's been designated acting interior secretary.
I can’t belive he’s wearing real fur, I let him know I just called PETA.
He wants to be called the Indomitable Snowman from now on.
He's not making foot prints because he's an illusion. What's our excuse?
We can't all be real.
Seriously?  In Aspen?
No-- it's average size  .
No! I'm going to ask for directions!
Just gave me the cold shoulder.
'Abominable?' Really? It's 2019, Jim.
This is the LAST time you pick the guide!
He said, if he's so abominable, find yourself another sherpa, pal.
We need to get our stories straight by the time we get back down"
He said the "abominable" thing is just a racist stereotype
How was I supposed to know? I thought they liked being called abominable!
He wanted to know if we were developers.
Look at me when I'm talking! Don't you realize how unique I am in your life?
What do you have against asking for directions?
"You've  gone and hurt his feelings. Why did you have to mention the size of his hands?"
Yeti, she persisted...
We met on Sasquatch.com!
He said we could take a selfie with him, but first he had to get dressed.
I found him quite pleasant, not abominable at all.
He says the view is not worth the climb.
It's not a yeti, it's Bigfoot, and he's as lost as we are.
"Do you think we can ask about Elvis?"
I want a divorce and yes, there is  someone else.
Though I warned him not to continue, Yeti persisted.
Well yes, if you must know...size does matter.
He says he's the new Chief of Staff
I'm sorry, but foot size really does matter.
Did you bring your grainy camera?
I suddenly find you inadequate as a man.
I'm sorry you came all this way John, but he loves me, hairy armpits and all.
Would it kill him to wear underwear.
Go ahead.  You always wanted a man cave.
Not only does he have a big foot...
I said it a dozen times on the way up. He’s Abominable, not Deplorable!
Sorry, Tim.  Turns out he's totally bominable.
Yeah, Bob, he may be abominable but he's not deplorable like you.
It’s not you, John. I just like hairy men.
He feels unseen.
He came out of hiding to run for 2020, says 'he definitely has a shot in this political environment'.
Call me crazy, but sometimes you act like I don't exist.
So much for solitude.
He’s in training.  Full ride next year at Alabama.
It’s disheartening to learn that people don’t believe in you.
He happens to be very sensitive about his appearance, but you wouldn't know anything about that would you.
Oh my God! It's not a myth! It's true what they say about big feet!
He asked if I knew if there were any good reason to go down into civilization.
He says the best ascent is up the north ridge, but then again, he doesn't exist!
He said he's actually the sweet one in the family but that his brother IS quite abominable.
He's not abominable, he's just a Republican.
One more time---we broke up  years ago
He's grouchy ; but he  runs an outstanding bed and breakfast.
I don't know.  I don't speak Yetish.
Are you sure it's not him? Let me see that photo again.
Now that’s a snowsuit.
I'm sorry Chad, but I need a man that doesn't wear a puffy jacket.
He’s upset, Charles. I would be too if you called me abominable.
Did you really have to ask him for a selfie?
He said he was still with Trump no matter what the Mueller report says.
The summit is closed due to the government shutdown
He said, " You  don't know what it means to be lost "
I know you care about me, but he makes me a better person
Actually,his manners were impeccable.
He asked me if I had a sister.
He looks like someone we could ask for directions
The only thing that’s abominable, Jonathan, is your manners.
I know. But he says he knows a short cut.
Once, again, no camera!
he said there's a Starbuck's just a bit further up.
John, that man isn't wearing any pants.
Why would you say that? I told you he was sensitive!
I didn't find him the least bit abominable.
O.M.G.  I thought you said you were going hiking with Betty!
He says he’s got some timeshare opportunities for us.
I'm beginning to think this guy's not a real Sherpa
« He only needs 5,000 steps to reach his goal. »
His accent is pretty hard to understand, but I've enjoyed the tour so far.
It's all right, he says he is just a hallucination caused by low oxygen.
He wanted to sell us a timeshare."
It's nothing personal Chad. He's just more genuine than you.
He told me to go back down - there is nothing to see here...
That Duluth underwear DOES look comfortable.
Well, at least he’d never leave his underwear on the bathroom floor!
Definitely not 'abominable.' He was actually quite pleasant
I thought it would be bigger.
His friends don't think we exist, so he's getting a lump of charcoal to draw us.
I forgot the camera.
He took my picture!
Yes, he is abominable!  But he has good health insurance and he. adores Ruth Bader Ginsberg!
Oddly enough, he IS dressed for it.
He was trying to seek asylum. Bad timing! Poor guy.
What do you mean you FORGOT to charge the camera?
You promised there wouldn’t be anyone else on this trail!
He says he knows where the best wi-fi spot is.
He's getting a fourth for bridge.
And get this, he's got a hot spot for internet.
He said no to the selfie but otherwise seemed nice.
It's just funny you're willing to follow anyone but me.
Well, I can definitely verify the Yeti is a HE.
Yet he persists
So great that your aversion to asking for directions works across species.
I'm leaving with him. And no, it has nothing to do with the size of his feet.
Is it just me or does our Sherpa have really big feet?
It's not you, it's me. Well, it's me and Bigfoot.
Oddly, he doesn't leave footprints.
Well, it's not the view I was expecting...
He prefers Indomitable to Abominable... .  And, most of all  he hates being called  Abdominal.
All he said was ‘Goodbye’, and then mumbled something about ‘The  Ascent Of Man’.
If I found him, I can find the trail.
He's less abominable than I had anticipated.
He said to forget evolution, he was forging ahead without us.
Sure, his manners aren't perfect. But abominable?
He didn’t like my calling him Herr Suit.
He said he dropped the "Abominable" years ago.
We agreed to remain friends.
Yeti or not, here we come!
No, I didn't sleep with him.  I just used him as a blanket.
He said we're going the wrong way.."
What if I DO think his butt's cuter than yours?
Abominable is derogatory Steve!
He'd like to know why Mad Men was canceled.
He said he’s looking for the illusive human.
He said he's not interested in being proven to exist. He thrives on the debate.
You say hirsute and I say hairsuit. What's the big deal?
He said he can’t take our picture. Something about the federal furlough.
Nice fella. He says to follow him and he'll have us for dinner.
Well if you won't ask him for directions than I will!
I told you not to mention Bigfoot.  --Now he's going to pout the rest of the way up!
He says he prefers the path less travelled.
He’s our Uber to the summit.
He says three's a crowd. I'll see you back at base camp.
He says he needs a wall to keep riffraff off the summit.
Are you sure there's nothing odd about our tour guide?
How gullible do you think I am. I am blind,Karen, not stupid
Actually, he's really pretty "ominable" once you get him talking.
Yet he left
I hope you're still proud of your "tech-free" vacation!
You forgot to charge the phone?!”
For once your hesitancy of asking locals for directions might actually be justified.
He says it's a pretty hairy climb from here on out...
I said I would marry you if the Yeti was walking with the tooth fairy!
Okay, now that he took off his clothes I can see why you'd think our guide is a Yeti.
You know what they say about guys with big feet- well that’s a myth.
He's going back for his Non-disclosure Agreement.
Another fur-loughed park ranger...
No, no, that's just Big Dave.  He's been running the nudist colony up the hill for about a decade now.
Have you ever thought about growing a beard?
I bet he does sas-squats.
As far as I'm concerned he's ancient history
He said three's a crowd
He's a bit brusque.  But certainly not abominable.
Yeti, schmeti, you were supposed to bring the damn camera.
If it looks like the Donald, walks like the Donald, and smells like the Donald, then it probably is a Sasquatch.
We can never tell your Uncle he was right, we'll never hear the end of it.
Stand back. I'm here to interview him for the White House chief of staff position... everyone else on the planet has refused.
When I said bring the Yeti, I meant the thermos...
I don't know if he was insulted by "Abominable" or "Snowman".
Well that's a letdown. For some reason I thought his feet would be bigger.
What did I tell you -- "layers."
You just had to call him "abominable.
.....wonder if he knows the Summit Meeting was cancelled"
Abominable?   I found him rather nice.
You're the one that claims to be so evolved
Mr. Yeti said that if we want a selfie at the summit with him AND the snow leopard, we are going to have to upgrade to the Platinum Package...


Leslie Hardin
Summit, New Jersey
He said to turn around or he's shutting down The Himalayas and building a wall.
He didn't seem all that abominable.
Frankly, Josh, I'm fine with you skipping the testosterone therapy.
I told him it's just a legend, but he wants to check for himself.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I must leave you because I've come to realize that size does matter.
Why don't you ever wanna ask for directions?
I swear, Peter, nothing happened.
We're in luck! He said he'll be right back with some toothpaste.
He'll be back after he meets his 10,000-step goal.
Look, we can't give a dollar to everyone!
He said,"Don't overthink it."
You can't just call him that, Jim.
Our guide is a natural.
He asked if we'd encountered anything unusual on the way up. I said not yeti and he took off in a huff.
I see your mother is joining us.
It's not you, it's the cargo pants.
He may be abominable, but at least he puts the seat down.
He was on the short list to replace Pruitt at EPA, but the President decided he wasn’t abominable enough.
Sorry, Trent. At this point in my life,
I need someone who is more upwardly mobile.
So what’s the big surprise you have for me?
Look, I know he may not be a conventional tour-guide, but hey, he takes Amex.
Because he gets me! In ways you will never understand! And stop calling him "Bigfoot".
You left your phone at base camp?!
I'm HIS service animal. He calls me "Not Yeti."
I thought you said we'd have the summit to ourselves.
Just had to say the A-word, didn't you?
Who knew he was sensitive about his body hair?
He asked me for directions
I don't understand why men refuse to ask for directions.
You are both behaving abominably.
Considering the size of his feet, I wasn't all that impressed.
Well how was I supposed to know he's sensitive about the size of his feet?
He said no photos - he’s still unhappy about the whole “abominable “ thing.
You promised your mother wouldn't come this time!
He just wished you'd asked before taking a picture
He said he doesn't believe in climate change.
He just asked me what time it was.
He said he's sorry, but this is something he has to do alone.
Don't feel so insecure, he had small hands.
I didn't see what?
He said it's over, stop texting.
You didn't think 'abominable' was offensive?!
Should I ask if he'll take our picture?
I told you he wouldn't care about your bucket list.
He said he knows the area
At least he puts the toilet seat down!
I don't like where this is going.
I told him I was married
Oh, yeah? Well, you're insufferable!
I have dedicated my whole life to funding him, but I wasn’t expecting him to invite us back for coffee.
Of all things, you had to ask about his small hands?
He's putting up a wall and closing the border.
I asked if he’d summited and he said not Yeti.
Well if you're not going to the top with me, I know someone ELSE who is.
He says he knows a shortcut. What do you think?
Did you have to mention the size of his feet?!
Extremely rare, I'd say.  He's never heard of Donald Trump.
Big butt is more like it.
Try “adorable” snowman next time
Wouldn’t an acid trip have been easier?
What’s his deal? All I asked was if he’d take our picture.
He wanted to know where I got my hiking boots.
Now can we go home
I wouldn't say 'abominable.' I'd say 'rough-hewn.'
I told you we should have asked for directions sooner.
"Well, that 'myth' happens to be our sherpa and he's very sensitive about his feet."
He seemed quite pleasant. Not at all abominable.
He’s actually quite amiable.
Great, Todd.  Now even the Yeti is leaving!
Big deal! I’d be much more excited by the existence of a snack bar right now.
He's moving to higher ground, citing habitat destruction and climate change.
I think I know why our guide was so cheap.
He looks like he knows where he's going. Let's follow him.
I still cannot believe you found this Sherpa on Yelp - he's amazing!!
He asked us to turn down the heat.
There's something off about our Sherpa.
From here on, it's clothing optional.
I've found someone else.
Think he'd be offended if I asked him to take our photo?
It's the big feet that make his hands look small.
Guess what, Travis. I think YOU'RE abominable.
He says another 2000 feet and then it's all down hill.
He was lost.
A better plan?? How about down?
I recognized the face but couldn’t remember his name.
So much for the legend - his feet seem perfectly proportional to me.
He’s  just a friend.
Wow! I guess the Paleo diet really works.
I told him “no thanks, I have Google Maps.”
I don't think he's going to be happy when he gets to the top and sees that we pooped in his cave.
Apparently we misgendered the Abominable Snow Man
Ignore him, he's trying to get his 10,000 steps before dinner
Actually, I found him quite personable.
He says it's not me, it's him.
When you say abominable, he hears unlovable.
All I could make out was "Get off my lawn!".
I thought the hair was supposed to be thinner up here.
He said this trail is closed until Trump caves on the wall.
He said there is nothing to see up here.
I'm sorry, but I need to be with someone who understands my needs.
He says that we are a figment of his imagination.
His New Years resolution is 20,000 steps a day.
Abominable? Really, Jim? Really
Huh, I thought he’d have bigger feet.
I thought it was just going to be the two of us this time.
It’s just “Snowman”. How would you like it if I always referred to you as Abominable Ralph?
He's a lot less expensive than a Sherpa.
I told you-they don’t like to be called ‘abominable’ anymore.
He said to get off his yard.
Nope. I didn't see anything either.
There goes another furloughed park ranger.
I can't believe you used the a-word.
OK, Big Shot!  You follow him to his cave to see his “etchings!”
Uncle Bill loves to scare the crap out of mountain climbers.
He wants us to wait , he's dropped his sunglasses.
He said he'll lead us to the summit as long as we don't tell the National Enquirer.
I think he said, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere."
Ignore him.  He doesn't like to be noticed.
He didn't have a phone charger either
He said, "Get off my lawn!"
That's all he said? "Humans exist."
No, YOU’RE abominable!
Hey hey! Eyes over here!
I asked him and he said,"Because it's there."
No", he said, "Not yeti." . .
I told you my ex was a wild one.
He doesn't say much, but he's the best Sherpa we ever had.
He said he left his car in the upper parking lot
He asked me if I had any conditioner.
I would say that greeting a Yeti as Bigfoot qualifies us as ugly Americans.
Yeti or not there he goes.
The Brooklyn beard craze is spreading.
I told you not to call him "abominable" to his face.
...f**kin' tourists...
How was I supposed to know it's insensitive to ask if he's related to Big Foot?
Make sure there's nothing in the background when you take the picture.
The government shutdown is awful for sure ... but this volunteer tour guide is fantastic.
He made a pass at me and you just stood there.
Sorry.  You know what they say about big feet.
The bastard just farted and kept walking.
You didn't have to be so rude, he was just asking to borrow your cell phone.
Now's a good time to start our descent.
Let him play through, he's a regular.
That's all right -- he doesn't believe in you, either."  --Stephen West, Laurel, Marylan
Well, he's not abominable to me! Go home, Jack
I told him no pants, no cocoa.
How would you like it if I called you abominable?
Can we just ask a local for directions?
Well, that explains the dimensions of what we found in the out house!
He said to turn back; the conditions up there are abominable.
My ex. He is abominable.
Look he's not an ideal guide but he really knows the mountains.
There's always somebody who shows off with no proper equipment or clothes.
Asking him to 'play through' was a great idea.
so apparently it's just a myth about foot size for men
I thought he'd be taller.
And WHY, exactly, didn't you ask him for directions...?
I told you we were overdressed.
Notice how he leaves no trace?
I think he knows the way
I'm sorry John, but you know what they say about big feet...
Hands are smaller then you’d think.
I swear, I've never seen him before in my life.
John, sometimes YOU have to ask for directions.
That's it--I'm asking for directions!
No, you are the one who spends too much time on their phone instead of watching what is going on around them.
Next time can you hire a Yeti that speaks English?
I told you we were going the right way.
I don't care if there are 10 Big Feet behind me!
I asked if we found the abominable snowman. He said, “Not Yeti.”
He finished with, “Say you never saw me.”
It’s true what they say: big feet, big...
Honestly, the only abominable thing was his breath
No pics. He has strict image and licensing control to avoid brand dilution from commercial over-exposure.
He asked us to pay for a wall.
Don't worry, no one will believe he reached the summit first.
Oh Great.  Now I'm a Bigfoot believer.
Why don't men ask for directions when they're lost?
He won't talk to anyone but CNN.
Jeez, sometimes it's like I'm invisible or something.
Let's cancel next week's trip to Loch Ness.
He's incredibly sensitive. How could you?
Well, I’d be offended too if a stranger called me ‘abominable’.
Relax. At this altitude hallucinations aren't that unusual.
All it said was 'Yeti or not, here I come' "
He says he knows the way to a bathroom.
He says we're mythical.
Was that necessary? Did you have to call him abominable?
Evolution? We can’t even keep up with him.
Apparently abominable is a trigger word.
More like adorable snowman.
You clearly offended him by calling him Bigfoot. I believe ‘Yeti’ is the appropriate term.
He'll guide us, but he only takes Bitcoin.
Our guide is kind of built for this, don't you think?
Apparently they run the upper section as a nudist colony.
I thought your New Year's resolution was to start making new friends.
Of course he's upset, Kevin. "Hey Yeti, take a selfie with my Betty?" Seriously?!
Well, his English was good enough to know what 'needs a bath' means.
Because he’s mysterious and doesn’t have roommates.
Relax, he didn't even get to first base camp.
It's not what it looks like...
I wasn't mocking him; I thought "Abominable" was his first name.
He said no pictures, but I got an autograph.
The next stretch is a little hairy.
No, YOU'RE abominable, John.
No, Ted-- you're fine. This is about me.
He just ate our sherpa.
He invited me up for a drink.
For the record, I requested a trip to the Serengeti.
Abominable he can live with," he says,"but Bigfoot hurts his feelings.
Unlike you, he hasn't reached his peak.
I just feel like it's weird that he's technically naked.
Tinder is really getting weird.
It didn't mean anything to me. It was just a winter fling.
This is not what it looks like, Jack!
Where'd you find this guide?  Not much of a talker... but he sure seems to know his stuff.
He said, and I quote, 'You can't get theah from heah'.
I think he just made an anti-Homo sapien remark.
The oxygen is too thin up here — and besides, he just ate Jim.
He’s kind of sensitive about the back hair.
Let's follow him. I think he knows where the president's tax returns are.
That's nice of you to say, but if my husband was truly a legend, I wouldn't be the one asking you for directions.
He's very upset over our inaction on climate change
He said we should try the Paleodiet
He's just misunderstood. There were more abominable people at base camp.
I swear, Bill, he's just a friend I happen to bump into occasionally.
He said the final ascent is his ‘me  time’.
Much friendlier than the French!
Who would have known that he's in the Witness Protection Program?
Well, he probably thinks you're abominable.
I said, "Ready to meet the world?" And he said, "Not yeti."
It's amazing what you can do with a comb-over!
Well, it's true what they say about big feet.
Turns out his name is Melvin.
Well, he calls you the Abominable Keith!
He said our use of adjectives is abominable
Nothing surprises me anymore.
I just said “You know what they say about big feet” and he stormed off.
He's going back into hiding since there are more than enough people being abominable without him.
It’s not you, it’s me. And him.
Do you think he'll divulge our existence?
What an amateur.  He doesn't even have a backpack, let alone the correct footwear!
Who is he to be lecturing us about footprints?
"What's 'abominable' is your sensitivity."
It was wonderful, but he snores.
I've got to go with him.  He's the most understanding...whatever he is ... I've ever met.  I've treated him abominably, Yeti still loves me.
Sorry, I prefer the strong, silent, abominable type.
Babe, trust me, it looks like he’s been here before.
Really, mister sensitive, 'abominable?'
He stimulates my heart and mind in ways you'd never understand. So,goodbye,Stanley.
That reminds me, I forgot to pack my razor.
Please don't ruin this by proposing at the summit.
Wow. 'Abominable?' Really, Greg?
Don't be jealous--I don't see him often.
I told you, Michael. He’s just an old friend.
Yes, I'm leaving you.  He has more than a big foot.
He says he’s considering running in 2020 because he can’t be any worse than the incumbent.
I've decided I need to try something different in life--don't take it personally.
When I asked if you brought your Yeti, I meant your insulated mug...
He's my support Yeti.
Good news. We found him.
Bad news. He's not into us.
Hunting Big Foot would be a lot easier if we weren't blind.
Sorry, but I have to follow my inner yeti.
Apologize!
I think we're overdressed.
He said “Millennials are abominable.”
No, he goes by ‘Barefoot’
Tesla stock down again? I bet next you’ll tell me Sasquatch is standing right behind me!
Well, I think your feelings would be hurt, too, if someone called you abominable.
He said, "All they call me is Big Foot, but they should see my other parts!!"
Funny they named him big foot, when that's not the big appendage that jumped out at me.
You had to put your big foot in your mouth!
Don't bother asking -- he already has home, auto, and life.
We went to Cleveland to meet my parents, its only fair that we go to meet his.
He said "Its to cold out here and he will wait for us in the car".
He likes what I do with my hair.
Just because I haven't shaved my legs in a while doesn't give you the right to draw a comparison.
It’s great, you still spot some of the old locals around here, it’s the only bit of Everest that we haven’t totally gentrified
The same thing any of us are seeking, I suppose.  Just wanting to be seen, really seen, by someone.
The Air BnB said "quiet and off the grid."
He says he doesn't have any idea of where the trail is, but rather smugly pointed out that he isn't lost.
Said he was out for some “me time” then just kept right on walking.
It IS true what they say about big feet...
People say we're  self-absorbed. Do you think we're self-absorbed?
He said he'll have another showing in two weeks.
Follow him if you want, but I don't think he really knows where the bathroom is.
He wanted to know if 2020 was over.
Of course he's upset. You treated him abominably.
'He says he's gonna build a wall.'
The track gets a bit hairy from this point
Hi, I'm Maggie - so what inspired you to try out high-altitude speed dating?
Sorry Eric, even he doesn’t want Mattis’ job
Did you have to call him Abominable?
You want to know what's really abominable?  Your readiness to judge based on appearance.
I’m sorry to leave you Mark, but he’s more of a social climber.
Sasquatch? No, it’s only Trump in costume hiding from Nancy Pelosi.
See, I told you we shoulda packed the camera!
I told him to stay hidden until Trump was gone.
He says we're lost.  Loch Ness isn't anywhere around here.
For only a small extra fee, the guides will wear the costume for 
our selfies at the top.
Oh just give it up already. You’ll never convince him down is superior to fur.
I guess he's not missing anymore.
He's going back for his parka.
There's a lot more to him than those big feet!
He might be abominable but that is no excuse to be rude!
Goodbye, John, no more washing & ironing shirts for me.
He says it's Jeti with a "J"!
Looks like your claim about making it to the top isn’t the only urban legend around here.
Should I say something?
He's counting steps.
I swear. Nothing happened!
I had to find out if it was true what they say about big feet.
God, I hate how your mom follows us everywhere!
Are you checking her out?!
He's a myth, you're not. Suck it up and stop whining!
He says there's nothing to see here
He says he's going to run against Trump in 2020.
No more abominable than the rest of you.
I told you that we were overdressed!"
Hello? Would you mind taking a photo of us?
He was asking for directions.
He prefers abominable snow person Bob!
Honestly, I thought his footprints would be bigger.
I told you a million times Steve, that was decades before we met. It's long over, leave him alone
Shut up with your animal rights extinction crap. This fur coat isn't getting away.
He left his cell phone on the summit.
Actually, no.  I found him to be quite pleasant.
Simmer down, Harry. We're just friends.
He said our table will be ready in 5 minutes
He said the 'mile high club' is a myth.
He said we should have turned left at the crevasse to get to Starbucks.
Lets just follow that guy, he seems to know where he is going
He said his life coach recommended nature walks.
Why didn't you tell me this hike was clothing optional?
Yes, there is a restaurant on the summit but he says the service is  abominable.
He doesn't believe there's an abominable president.
I can’t believe it!  A “no photo” policy?!?!
Don't be too hard on yourself George. I've just always been attracted to mysterious men.
He keeps muttering "I am not fake news.  I am not fake news"
Did you have to use the A-word?
We just weren’t right for each other. He felt the need to Sasquatch-splain everything to me.
Honey, we were just talking.
Yeti, Schmeti... He said his name is Paul.
He says the guru is just a myth.
You just couldn't be the bigger man.
This isn't what it looks like...
The one time we forgot the camera!
He says we should have taken that left back at the Denny's.
Just ask him for directions.
He insisted his name was Yuri, not Yeti.
Quick, take a picture ... he didn't leave any foot prints!
I thought he said Eddie, not yeti.
Just because you found me with a naked yeti doesn’t mean I’m having an affair.
What is wrong with you?  He says there's a Starbucks up there.  Why don't you believe anyone about anything?
I'm leaving you for someone far more abominable.
He's much more handsome than his photos.
He just called me an abominable human!
Confirmed...Starbucks ahead one mile!
He said the Starbucks is up ahead.
We're out of luck -- he didn't bring his selfie stick either.
Fictional or not, he’s a heckuva trail guide.
Look, I know you said you’re good with anything, but I feel like I need to ask again. Are you sure you want to go to this orgy?
There's a thin line between lovable and abominable.
He says he's king of the hill.
I didn't mean to hurt you, Larry. There's just something so indescribably sexy about a no-maintenance guy--no clothes, no chitchat, no toilet paper--nothing.
He says we're welcome at the top, just not yeti.
You have some big shoes to fill now, Buster.
Don't worry, he's only a myth
You first...
Honestly, I thought I was sleeping with you.
I've told you Greg, it's not the size of your feet that's the issue.
Maybe next time bring the camera instead of that damn hiking stick.
It was an icy reception at best.
Yer damn straight I married 'im, and he wants you to stop followin' us."
Go back to the last glacier and take a RIGHT, just like I said the first time.
You wait here Jeremy, he wants to show me the view
Let's just say, it's not just his foot that's big.
Can you believe it? He said we’re an illusion because we’re not leaving tracks.
Just because he is abominable, doesn't mean he's a bad leader.
I don't see what's so abominable about complimenting my ponytail Bob.
Okay Wendell, Billy is not your son. I suppose it was only a matter of time before you guessed the truth anyway.
Who knows? He just wanted directions.
No really, he’s just a friend!
He said he'd take us as far as Yetisburg.
‘Not entirely unlike Sisyphus,’ were his words to me in passing.
Of course he ignored us, he's an anti-social climber.
He says we should have turned right at the ravine. Now aren’t you glad we stopped for directions?
No problem! He just wanted directions on how to get to Burning Man
I knew the summit was at 8 thousand feet, but nobody told me they'd be BIG feet
He says that the only thing that’s abominable these days is Trump.
Who knew!... he’s not abominable at all.
See, I told you this hike would be legendary.
Why don't YOU tell him that he's abominable?
I told you he wasn't real!  Do you see any footprints??
He wants us off his mountain. We're not white enough.
Sure. I turn around and you shout, Gotcha! Very funny.
Go ahead, you tell him we are going the wrong way.
I'm sorry to say, but foot size has nothing to do with it.
He said we can check in to his Airbnb any time now.
Should we have asked for a selfie?
Actually, his name is Bigdick — he’s Bigfoot’s more popular brother.
Let him go first.  He was born here.
He has a summer place at Loch Ness.
Look, bigfoot- bigass- we all see things differently, Gary. Does it really matter?! We're lost! Don't you get that?! Let's just ask the guy, 'which way to the summit.' He seems like a local. He should know.
Who knew he'd be so sensitive about his body hair?!
Because of someone he called the "Orange-haired Abominable Showman," he decided to disappear again until at least 2020.
Well, he looked like he knew the way out of the parking lot.
If I ever get on Jeopardy this is definitely the story I’m telling Alex Trebek!
He obviously hasn't seen the Patagonia catalogue.
He’s going ahead to prepare the appetizers
The border's just ahead, but he says there's a very big wall.
He said cell reception was better near the top.
Is it me or is the guide a bit rude?
People laugh, but you don't see him freezing out here.
He said we are welcome to stay but the toilets are overflowing because of the shutdown.
I have a funny feeling about our trail guide, yet - I can't put my finger on why
He says he's not coming down until they bring back the McRib.
I told you he'd be offended if you asked if he was 'for real.'
I already asked. He said it’s faux fur.
Don't be so sensitive!  I just said he was a huge guy.
Looks like this next stretch is going to get pretty hairy.
How could you? You know he's sensitive to the use of the "A" word!
Thankfully, he said he's a vegan now
He's leaving - said he's on a quest for intelligent life forms
It's a Yeti not a Yogi! Is it any wonder he goes out of his way to avoid people?
He never really believed in me.
Next time you hire a guide get a background search, this guy's abominable!”
Steve, we should have asked him for directions!  HE looks like he knows where he's going...
He said the view's not worth it.
Would Bigfoot ask to borrow a phone charger?
He says the coffee at the top is terrible. Let's turn back.
He's not leaving any footprints!
Yes, I am leaving you.
Allen, I meant “abominable” in the best way possible!
Look, he doesn't want to be in the selfie.
Maybe we've been reading that evolution diagram backwards.
Actually, he respects me.
If I have to say size doesn't matter one more time . . .
I can't help but feel like I'm missing something big...
For the last damned time, I didn't eat your trail mix.
I’m really not sure which of you is worse at asking for directions.
He just wanted to make sure we weren't planning on staying and transforming the neighborhood into a hipster's paradise.
Keep quiet, the body language says he's not going to be responsible for his actions if we keep asking, are we their yeti ?
Well... I do want to be taken higher.
He asked me if I know of a good place for electrolysis.
No hello! Not a smile!  Not even a nod! No wonder his ilk went extinct!
No, I thought that you brought the phone.
He's going to show us a shortcut.
He said he’ll appreciate it we just follow him on Twitter and/or Instagram.
I can't believe you said that.  Now tell him you're sorry!
Your yodeling offended him.
Wow! This nature walk really lets you get in touch with the locals!
Yes, the tour guide is very experienced.
His wife made him stop and ask directions.”
He asked me if he was close to the top
Look,they don't leave footprints after all.
You just had to insist we leave our smartphone-cameras behind on this climb, didn't you Nature Boy?
Sasquatch? Really? I can't believe you think all ape-like creatures look the same.
He isn't even TRYING to hide from us!  I'm a little insulted.
You've got some pretty big shoes to fill.
Well, I'd bet your feelings would be hurt if I called you abominable.
Dad, you promised you wouldn't make a scene!
No Doug, I haven't heard what they say about guys with big feet.
Asking him about his origins was very discriminating. YOU are a monster.
Nice, Dan! I told you not to say anything. He has a "condition".
Brad, you can't just ask him why he's abominable.
Actually, he was only mildly unpleasant.
He said he is not from around here.
YOU wanted to hire a GUIDE, so we are going to follow HIM!
He was happy to hear that the climate is warming, since he is losing some of his hair.
You shouldn't have said that about his feet.
I figured he'd take "abominable" as a compliment.
I asked him if he was cold and he said "not yeti"!
Sorry, that threw me for a minute. That was my ex.
I told you it's better to follow the locals
Don't be so judgy. He looks mostly harmless and he is going our way.
He was heading down for groceries, but forgot his cell phone.
I'm leaving you Harry...for Hairy.
Is that what we were or what we will be?
Bill, I've met someone new.
Sorry, but I'm leaving you for someone more grounded and in touch with nature.
That's my guide.  Thank god for Google Translate.
Nature sure does get interesting during these government shutdowns.
Honest, we're just friends.
I said good morning and how are you doing and all he said was 
" I go up, I come down, Yeti Yeti Yeti"
He asked for a MAGA hat: he's a big fan of isolationism.
He asked if we knew any single and abominable snow women.
His name is Francis. You're the abominable one.
Didn’t that guy pass us eons ago?
Himalaya, if you know what I mean.
But he called me, “Sheena of the Mountain;” you only call me a social climber.
You promised we wouldn’t see any other tourists.
That's the last time I'll swipe right on a profile without a picture.
Did you see his six pack. Abdominal indeed!
I swear it's over. He's an animal.
Maybe you shouldn't have called him "abominable" to his face.
Because he's not a wuss.
Does your father always have to take off his clothes when he feels hot?
Well if you hadn't called him 'The Abominable Slow Man'...
Until this moment, I thought you were pretty well endowed!
The all-knowing Guru on top of the mountain? He said he ate him.
He’ll be right back, he left his shades in the car.
No, Mr. Insecure, I couldn't see how hung he is.
He said "Abominable is in the eye of the beholder."
He says Bigfoot's a myth.
Good job, guide!  He said we should be on the mountain over there!
You go first, dear.
I just told him to take a hike
Are you even listening to me?!
Let’s ask him for directions; he seems to be a local.
I cant't believe you called him the "Y" word!
I’m seeing somebody else.
The moment Jill realizes that “cold weather shrinkage” might be a phenomenon unique to humans.
Apparently, they're very serious about casual Fridays.
Our Smartphone detox was your idea.
You don't even know him - your intolerance is what's abominable.
But why do you trust his directions over mine?
I'm sorry, Steve, but I've found someone else.
He'll guide us to the top, but we can't take pictures.
He asked me for my phone number
Ugh. Are you happy NOW that we deleted Facebook? Everyone would be so jealous right now.
Climate change is driving them to higher elevations.
He says the bathrooms are closed due to the Trump shut down .
Oh that’s Larry - he’s a bit of a local celebrity.
He said get lost
Wish you had one that big!
I told him fur is murder and he just ignored me.
He says the conditions ahead are just abominable
He said he was flattered, but worried about the optics of another white male hosting the Oscars.
I told you not to call him abominable!
Don't worry. He's just a manifestation of your oxygen deprivation.
Believe it Seth, you’re finally free to date that mermaid in 11b
We need to head back now! The hallucinations are getting worse.
Wow. That better be faux fur.
I told you not to book an unlicensed Sherpa.
He's announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run in 2020.
Okay, first off.... He doesn’t appreciate the label “abominable.”
He’s just trying to find himself.
Nice but a bit paranoid. How many people can be looking for him?
Bob, our mountain guide is a beast. There's no way we'll keep up.
You just had to comment on his looks, didn't you?
He asked if you would wait for us here.
Yeah....we met on tinder.
He recommends the fondue from the chalet on the left.
That's Mister Everest. He's the owner.
No,no...that's not him..I'm looking for the Adorable Snowman!
He said he's never hiked here before, Yeti looks so familiar.
Clothes optional from this point on.
I said call him Snowman - he hates 'Abominable.'
He said there’s nothing interesting to see up there.
I'm tired of your constant complaining, Richard.  Either pick up the pace or we'll go on without you.
He said ' No pictures'.
But he swears he knows this trail like the back of his foot.
He prefers Sasquatch. Says the mean kids stuck him with Big Foot.
Don't, he'll just use it for drugs.
Sorry, Topher, I need more mystery in a man.
Puffy jackets are out.  The Performance Fleece Onesie is the new must have.
He says he doesn’t want to be discovered.
He said we have to contact his Agent for a picture.
You’re the one who’s abominable.
Do I really have to be the one to ask him for directions?!
It’s Abominable SnowPerson!
No, he's on his way to Washington, D.C. to protest. President Trump just did away with the endangered species act.
I’m sorry but he just fulfills my fantasies more than you.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIS FEELINGS. WHAT DOES "ABOMINABLE" MEAN ANYWAY?
He said, "46 and half, triple E."
And yet i still don't believe
I said to follow “Siri”, not “Yeti”!
If I knew he was so sensitive about the size of his feet, I would have called him Sasquatch.
Taking that gap year did a lot for his self-confidence.”
And when have you ever wanted to ask for directions?
He thought we were from Publisher’s Clearing House
I'm sick and tired of living your fantasies
Big foot my ass!! You always change the subject when you’re caught!
I know it’s Trump, it said it was the greatest abdominal snowman.
Not a soul. You?
“no, Ken - You’re abominable!”
Doesn't know, says he's from out-of-town.
He’s going to get his family for a group selfie
I tried to say "Happy New Year", but my yettish isn't very good.
I told him to go get lost if he wants to preserve his reputation
It's not what you think...
He said the "23andMe" thing is baloney.
Size matters.
Dave, I told you not to talk about politics!
He just wanted to know who won the election.
I told him I was seeing someone else.
He's taking us to Elvis and the Easter Bunny.
Wow. I guess it's really true what they say about a man who has a big  foot".
He told me a little higher up there's a WALL to keep us out.
Staying warm must have been more important to him than evolution.
I told you he was easily offended.
Is it just me or does he look much scarier on Instagram?
Your wife looks pissed!
it’s just sometimes i feel like u don’t even know he exists
My Fitbit says 1,000 steps to the top. His says 250. Go figure.
He's nothing but a show-off. Big foot, bigger ego.
Can't be him. Feet are way too small.
I don't think so...I heard him muttering that it was a long way to go just for some crappy star wars convention...
What did you say to him this time?
He says he's got wi-fi
Would you believe, he asked me to go up to his place.
Apparently he finds your puffy jacket abominable.
He asked if he was near the top.  I said "Not Yeti."
You just HAD to say manscaping!
No Harvey, he's just an old college friend!
He said his name is Harvey Weinstein.
With Amazon Prime, we get free Sherpa.
He's going back up. He thinks it's become abominable down here.
I haven't seen any footprints either.
Post-impeachment, he just wants to be left alone.
I spoke to the local and it seems we’ve been going the wrong way.
I can’t believe you dropped the “A” bomb!
I've met someone else.
I don't care that you two were frat brothers Larry, we are NOT staying in his cave!
I don't know. He just gave me the cold shoulder
I won't tell if you won't tell.
He's not abominable at all. He's been very helpful.
And I say we follow him!
He's not mad.  He just wants to be seen.
Sure you don't want to meet my Dad?
Let him lead he knows the neighborhood
I swear I’ve never seen him before!
I'm leaving you because he validates my feelings.
The only thing abominable here is your lack of sensitivity.
This is why we need immigration reform.
I'm done Mark — I get that your Dad is a nature person, but he needs to put some clothes on.
He said there's nothing worth seeing up there.
You hired him as our guide so who's the neanderthal really?
If he eats there, how bad can it be?
He packed NONE of his waste out of base camp.  Talk about abominable!
I think he said we're near the top, but his accent is abominable.
He said, "I'm not the Bigfoot you're looking for," but that may have been just a Yeti mind trick.
It'll be hard to follow in his footsteps.
The Contiki website said he’s an abominable tour guide, but so far I’d say he’s been great!
Relax, George. I just told him threesomes are not our cup of tea
He said we're still about 1,000 big feet away from the peak
Please do hurry, James, he says the Starbucks closes in ten minutes.
If he really is so abominable, then why did he just compliment your jacket?
He said the nearest Starbuck's is two mountains to the left, and down about 4500 feet.
You're smarter but he's got the edge in experience.
So now what?
He asked me to take a picture of him and his family.
He’s running for President.
He hasn’t seen him.
Frankly, sometimes you're kind of abominable too, Greg.
Actually, he seems indomitable.
He said he was going up for an iced coffee and asked me if I wanted anything.
He's half the man and twice the beast that you are.
Some call him Sasquatch, yeah, but us locals call him hairy naked Bill.
You said you wanted to meet my parents, right?
Thru-hikers are so intense.
'You know I've always wanted a REAL mountain man, Stan.'
We’re friends on Instagram
He's always in a mood during tourist season.
Yes, I do feel sometimes like evolution has passed me by.
Actually he was quite pleasant . . . amiable, certainly not abominable.
I have to warn you: I'm just out of an abominable relationship.
What guy?
'He said walking sticks are for pussies.'
We've just been ignored by a Yeti, Josh.  Makes me feel, well, abominable, actually.
All I did was to ask him if he thought global warming was fake news.
He hit on me, some line about big feet.
You might as well turn back. There's really nothing to see up there.
Who knew we’d run in to the next GOP Presidential candidate up here!
And yeti seemed so nice.
These Virtual Reality sunglasses are really fantastic!
What did he mean when he said we'll be late for dinner?
I'm telling you--Cross Fit.
Don't drag him into this. I left because YOU are the abominable one!
He says there's no Starbucks.
He just said we should be careful, you never know what creatures are walking around up here.
I promise, I'll never see him again!

He says we can use the trails all we want, but his Himalaya Shutdown is going ahead no matter what.
I'm sorry, Larry, but he's offering me a home with a view.
He said he'd introduce me to the Tooth Fairy.
Shhhh, shhhhh, there goes my ex.
I hope you know that without a selfie no one will believe us!
This tourism on Everest is getting out of control.
Wow, you really are never going to propose, are you?
He’s harmless; he just wants trail mix.”
I told you before, size doesn’t matter!
He says to please tell the world that they may be wide, but really they're just a size 9 1/2.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned shrinkage.
Hey, he knows a short cut.
See I told you...he said were going the wrong way!
No - It's his cousin The Respectable Yeti
Stop him! Maybe he can take a picture of us!
It's Esteem Lacking Snow Person now.
Our selfie together came out really blurry for some reason.”
Come on Todd, I may be blind but my nose works.
George, I'd like to start seeing other people.
I'll never let you set me up on a blind date again!
Well, you know what they say about men with big feet...
He doesn't look as big in person.
He says not Yeti.
He would come down more often but people keep talking about his feet.
You called him Bigfoot?!
I told you we should have brought our camera. He only wanted $5 for a selfie with him.
I don't care if that's what the other explorers call him. "Abominable" isn't nice.
How rude of you! He only asked for directions.
Way to go! You hurt his feelings.
You go. I want to be found.
He is less abominable where it counts ... good bye and good luck.
He's upset; he thought it was "abdominal."
No, the most amazing part was finding myself.
He says it's pronounced yeh--TEE.
Wouldn't you know, the selfie was all blurry.
he said, nothing to see up there...
He said the guru is on the next mountain over.
He says we can get a signal up here.
You know the old saying?
It will never be the right place to tell you I found someone else.
He'll be right back; he left his iphone in the cave
I think he's Italian.  I asked to get a selfie with him, and he kept saying "not yeti....not yeti"
You just never know when you'll spot a celebrity!
You’re the one with no social skills!
He doesn't want to be called fake news anymore.
I think we’ve discovered who’s really abominable here—and I’m pressing on with the yeti.
He said to leave behind only a small carbon footprint.
I have a feeling we ain't seen nothing yeti.
And of course now I realize we left the camera back in the tent!
“Size does matter - it’s true what they say about big feet."
He said there's a Starbucks just over the next ridge.
Okay, so he says we took a wrong turn back at base camp.
Honey, I really enjoyed the Pilates, the tapas dipped in flecks of gold, and the W.B. Yeats poetry, but I want someone more primitive.
Jesus — and neither one of us brought a camera?
It is your behavior that I find abominable!
All the money we spent on gear and we still can't keep up with him.
I bet you used the word 'abominable'"
Every day about this time. He has quite a commute.
He says he has a higher calling....
These days I never know what to believe
No John, he doesn't have a big dick
He makes it look so easy.
He's been like that since his yak died
He asked if Trump was still alive.
Abomanable sex is still sex.

He said that we are lost
He said there's a two hour wait.
He'll be back when he meets his daily step goal.
He says he has to get back to the White House.
I actually think his feet are the perfect size for his body.
He exposed himself and all you could do was take a photo!?
I hear the next stretch can get pretty hairy.
He said he didn't want to be the third wheel.
I wanted to be first, so we might as well go back.
I told you, the preferred term is Yeti.
Yes honey-size matters...he's not just big foot!
He says he’s building a wall.
Are we there Yeti?” Really
You’re right.  That is who I was making the sweater for.
...he said he’s pissed off...his 23andMe came back and he’s related to Elizabeth Warren...
Not to worry, he was just asking for directions.
It’s his mountain. I’m not going to drop in without a gift.
I don’t care who she is!!! It’s demeaning how you look at other women.
He said “Follow me if you want to see something really interesting”.
All he asked is that I spell his name correctly. So, yeah, it was worth it.
I'm keeping my name professionally but, yeah, officially it's Karen Bragin-Yeti.
He says he's not coming down until people get over the whole 'abominable' thing.
Who invited your mother?
Quick, give him your business card. You are the manager of a Big and Tall store.
"I know I recognize him from somewhere, but I just can't put my finger on it.
HE SAID NEXT HE’S GOING TO FORD EVERY STREAM.
These new sunglasses really make a big difference. I'm seeing details I never noticed before.
What do you want from me.....he was the only guide they had left!
I'm sorry but my foot fetish is bigger than both of us.
Was that the Dos Equis guy?
He says it’s too damn hot and come back after we stop global warming.
This guide was highly rated on Yelp!
Well, how would you feel if someone called you 'Abominable'?
It gets pretty hairy from here.

You're nice but he's Bigfoot. I've been looking for him my whole life.
He says he needs to get home in time for Dancing with the Stars.
Next year we're doing Christmas at *my* parents' house.
She’s a lot taller than I expected

He says the view is so-so.
You know, if we weren't blind maybe we could find big foot
You don’t always get to choose your mentor in life, Jason.
He looks less abominable in person.
I told you. He's just an old friend from college...
He's a great guide, just no photo ops.
He said he just wanted to know if it was 2020 yet.
He said, "Google Earth can just leave me the hell alone."
Well I will, if you are too embarrassed to ask for directions Tom
Don't worry,it was consensual.
I told you the lack of oxygen does wonders for the imagination.
I'm not afraid but... I'll race you to the bottom...
He said it hurts his feelings when we call him Abominable.
Of course he resents being called Abominable."
He was surprisingly articulate.
See? I told you he’d lap us again.
Funny how myths develop.  Compared to you today, he wasn’t so abominable after all.
He's much warmer than you Stan.
All he said was, 'I want to be alone'.
I envy his lack of gear.
I'll admit Gary's a little grumpy in the mornings, but i wouldn't call him abominable...

Did you see that guy’s calves?
My ex.
He said we are on the wrong path to enlightenment.
He seemed super relatable until he made me sign an N.D.A.
Yes, and it was the best I ever had !
Are you sure he's a local?
But his cave has good reviews.
Oh yeah?  Well, he's a lot less abominable than your "vacation" idea.
I TOLD YOU he wouldn't want to take a selfie!
Don’t worry Jim, he has a 5-star Airbnb experience rating
Sorry to drag you along for nothing ... he looked nothing like his tinder profile photo!
Let’s see if he will take our photo.
It's been downhill with us for so long, I just need a change.
He claims to have been the president.
Why do you lash out at every guy with bigger feet?
He may look like a veteran hiker, but he’s just a Wookie.
Turns out he’s fed up with the saying about men with big feet
He said he preferred Saquatch, but if I can't spell it right, go with Bigfoot.
It's over, Brad. Squatch is giving us a minute to say farewell.
Yeah, we can go on up, but I had to give him my Netflix passcode.
He thinks you are abominable.
We dated briefly... he wasn’t my type.
I don't know what's worse--me running out of water or you running out of photo storage space on your iPhone.
I know you warned me but he's still my Dad!
I think you insulted him when you said "I don't believe it!"
Just follow that guy.  He seems to know where he's going.
You promised this wasn’t going to be weird or uncomfortable!
He told me his name, yet I  don’t remember it.
He said there's nothing of note up there, so we might as well give up on finding anything interesting. This whole trip was a waste of time!
You'll never guess who I ran into!
I've had it with Colorado men. I'm going to try this for a while.
Just follow him. I lost the map.
What's abominable is your attitude!!
I told him: "Long-term commitment or take a hike!"
Oh stop. You just have footprint envy.
Okay, I have been seeing someone else."
He's upset that no-one ever mentions his calves.
He said he didn't have a watch.
He thinks we should start seeing other people
Good thing we made reservations.  He said it's always
crowded at peak times.
The guide reviews in Trip Advisor said that Yeti is not much of a talker but he knows his way around the mountain.
He won't let us pass due to the shutdown
I told you we didn't need all this ridiculous gear.
Hi - I just met the nicest guy. Local fella. Says he owns a restaurant up top. Invited us to stop by.
Clearly man is not on the ascent.
It's over. I'm leaving you to start a new life with Jeffrey!
He said there are no facilities past this point
I guess it’s true what they say - Bigfoot, big...
Yeah. He won’t do any free sightings. He’s going to wait out the shutdown.
It was YOUR idea to build a snowman. All I did was splice some genes to make it happen.
He asked for my number then remembered he left his phone in his cave.
Can you take a picture of me with the mountains? Just make sure the yeti doesn't show up in the background and ruin the shot.
He said we are welcome to come up to his house but he wants you to know his WiFi is on the fritz.
Suddenly me not having a razor for a week doesn't seem so bad, huh?
He suggested we try the ascent tomorrow; conditions today are abominable.
Once he finds himself the mystery's over.
Enough already with your foolish male pride, don't be afraid to ask for directions.
No, I don't think he saw us.
Yet, he is an urban legend, and you're just an urban escapee.
The one time you ask for directions...and it's from a Yeti.
Leave me and my husband alone!
Yeah, I saw it!--Must be the latest from Patagonia.
We talked, but even his words were blurry and ambiguous.
I trust him. He's white.
He looks like he knows where he’s going...should we ask him for directions?
You just had to tell him that he isn’t wearing pants,
He says the mountain is calling, but so is nature.
Maybe he knows how to get back down, Clark!
He forgot the keys.
Apparently he failed to trademark Yeti.
I know he's experienced, but what are his references?
Really, he means nothing to me.
He wanted to know if i've seen his polar bear
...no, I don't think this is a good time to tell him you don't beleive
It will be a more pleasant climb if you stay down wind from him
-Are we there yet?
- Not Yeti
Well, he did say 'no selfies'.
He's part of the nudist colony just off the trail.
See, I told you fur was in again.
When you said “Let’s go to the Himalayas. What’s the worst that can happen?” this is exactly what I thought the worst would be.
He has a vacancy at his hairbnb.
He says his name is "Tom", he's currently unattached, and his brothers are all tall too - oh, and he hates having his picture taken...
I don't know. His feet weren't that big.
He’s not just abominable, he’s rude!
He told me he's lost
He said he knows a shortcut
where did you get this guide
He says the view from the top is worth the walk.
I told you he was sensitive about his body hair, Greg!
He had a thick accent but I think he said that we are ducked.
I’m leaving you. He really knows how to make me peak.
Well, I don’t think he’s the least bit abominable.
I gave him our outfitter's card.
The only time I forget my camera and bigfoot walks right past me!
He said to just go down about a mile and make a left and the coffee shop is on the right.
Ohh...hello dear, it isnt how it looks
I told him it was me not him.
What's the point? We forgot the selfie stick.
He said there is a $20 cover charge from here.
Do something. He said abominable things to me.
This is where we part ways.
This is definitely less touristy than the other one...
You've really offended him Bill. You just don't call a Yeti Bigfoot
You see, I told you my dad could keep up with us.
It was just a coincidence!  I am not obsessed with him!
No, I'm not asking Sasquatch for directions.
He said we can come up but not yeti.
So sorry John. I'm in love with him. We're going to meet his mom.
He wanted to know what 'abominable' means.
He wanted to be a guide on Mt. Rainier, but couldn't get a visa.
I thought your uncle wasn't coming with us.
He was the last Sherpa available but so far he's been great.
I don't know. We were having a great time until I asked about that whole abominable situation.
He's just not that into you.
He's not so Abominable!
Abominable"? Really? You can be so insensitive sometimes
Don't get upset, he was just asking for directions.
I kinda like my men hairy...
No footprints! So he’s not real, and we’re not, either!
For a local his sense of direction is abominable.
He said he’s tired of waiting for the Uber.
We have to conquer some other mountain.
He told me there's a Starbucks just over the next ridge!
So... There is a Mar-a-Largo Himalaya.
Make sure you put "local favorite" in the review
Not so abominable in the sack!
See, he’s not using walking sticks
He says he wants to clean up a little first.
He said, 'Baby it's cold outside...'
This trail is getting way too trendy.
Should we ask him to take our picture?
Could you hold up for a bit and give us some space?
Or should we tell them about the flying saucer?
How much do you tip a guide like him?
Maybe there is something to that Paleo Diet.”
This is where Biggie and I leave you.
He said he found what you called him podiatrically normative.
You hurt her feelings, you monster!
Something tells me to turn back.
He'll be right back.  He thinks he left the stove on.
No, John - there actually is a mountain high enough and I’m with him now.
His daughter lost a mitten yesterday, he's just out checking everywhere.
I would never have believed it. A harrier butt than yours does exist.
He claims he already has enough friends on social media.
I told him to go home to his wife and cubs and quit hitting on female tourists.
He's meeting his step goal.
His unicorn got away.  He's wondering if you've seen it.
Clearly fake news!
Honey, I swear it's not what it looks like!
He said he's sorry, he loves you, but it's over.  You can keep the stick.
Well that’s a relief: he shared his wifi password
He wants a mate but I told him I couldn't cook.
He said, he's definitely coming back to vote in 2020.
Nothing three or four episodes of "Queer eye" wouldn't take care of...
He says we can study him, but after Wheel of Fortune.
I don't know.  He just grunted and took my lunch.
Don’t be silly, we’re just good friends.
I told you not to say anything about his haircut.
I TOLD you, NO politics.
Is he gone? Phew...we used to date. It did NOT end well.
Don't mind him, he's just neandering around.
Only his breath was abominable.
Anywhere he wants to.
He says he needs his alone time
Abominable” is so racist
I told you he wouldn't have any marijuana.
Of course I saw him! Do you think I'm snowblind?
Sorry Jim but if I have to live with an abominable man, size matters!
She is offended.  She says we are, 'contaminating her environment and we smell bad.'
Did he just say Climate Change Deniers are abominable?
He’s my friend so get over it.
Please tell me it's Halloween and that's your very large friend wearing a costume.
I told him to stop worrying about his follower count and try connecting with people in real life for once.
It’s tacky to ask celebrities for an autograph.
Is it just me or is our guide a little... unkempt?
He's actually sort of likable.
He wants to know if Robert Mueller has been asking for him.
I bet that guy knows something we don't.
He says there's one with great coffee and wifi at the bottom.
Yeti, schmeti, I say let’s follow him!
No, Jeffrey.  You’re abominable!
These Aspen bigwigs and their fur coats!
Well how would you like being called abominable?
I'm leaving you dear for the man you used to be.
He'll join us in the base camp tonight  for cocktails at 6:30.
Why can't you be more like that guy?
He’s really serious about the Paleo diet; I see him hiking this hill everyday.
We're overdressed.
He thinks humans have a nerve calling him 'abominable'.
Sasquatch has a point Bob, Trump clearly personifies the fatal flaws in postmodern social constructivist thinking..!
He says we misunderstood.  The yogi is on the other mountain.
I told you to use a gender-neutral pronoun.
You and your labels...you just insulted him!
Yeah, well, I can't help his language skills, but he's still the guide.
He's not afraid of  us personally, but he thinks it's an I.R.S. audit.
He says they're not open yet.
Yet I" what?! Just say it
You’re the one who thought having a yeti would improve our relationship!
He says it's at least another mile and honestly I'm like, how amazing is it ACTUALLY gonna be?
I feel like you're not listening to me.
Yes, I am going to leave you and follow him. I've decided that SIZE does matter!
You said you wanted to experience new cultures.
Goddammit, you knew we'd had a previous relationship when you agreed to this hike!
No!  We cannot go to his place for “drinks.”
He says he used to be President of the United States but was found to be abominable.
Really? You know hoax is a trigger for him!
The Abominable Snowman isn't coming down with us. He's feels the abominable creature we've elected is already one too many.
He said no selfie's, but you just couldn't let it go!
He’s invited us to dinner.
Expert mountaineer, but the camera hates him.
It feels like the higher we climb the more we devolve
He says there's a Starbucks up on the left.
That's exactly the problem, Dan--you NEVER pay attention.
He’s cooler than you’d expect.
I’m sorry, but he just didn’t have that ‘wow’ factor I thought he would
I feel like we're missing something.
I threatened to wax him.
He's still mad about getting no credit from Hillary on Everest.
May I borrow your selfie stick?
Yes, Brad! I’m going with the yeti.
He's mad that we didn't call ahead to say that we were coming.
Which part of “He’s not taking questions from the lying mainstream media” did you not get?
Oh yeah?  Your attitude is abominable.
So apparently "abominable" is their word.
He said 13EEE.
Ah-Yeah, I think he knows the mountain a little better than that sherpa you wanted to hire.
He said we should have turned at 72nd Street.
I’m his agent so if you want to meet him talk to me
"He prefers Melvin to Sasquatch. But he'll answer to Bigfoot."
Luckily he seems like a vegetarian.
He Said, "No Habla Ingles!"
He said it's gonna be crowded up there.   They're doing a Yetti photo shoot for National Geographic.
Are you kidding? Mansplaining to yet another marginalized individual about how dominant society renders them invisible?
I'm going with him. He's not that abominable.
“Don’t leave me like this—between a rock and a hairy place.”
Just because it looks like he might make it all the way to the top, doesn't mean we have to follow him Dan.
He just asked to use my phone for a selfie as he’s not sure he really exists.
He said go high when they go low.
Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Yeti…whatever. Do you have anymore of those peanut butter-filled pretzels?
You count to 20 while WE go and hide.
"He finally got the news of who won the election and he's going to sleep it off."
I'm not sure this is Sherpa we started this climb with
He seems a tad more knowledgable about this place
He said the closest Starbucks is in a Walmart at the summit.
It's just teen angst, dear. He won't always be this reclusive.
It's easier if you follow in his footsteps.
You called him abominable? I think you hurt his feelings.
Ugh, I told you there'd be tourists.
He'd take us to the summit, but he wants payment in Bitcoin.
Relax Andy.  If he was going to eat us why would he offer to let us use his phone to call search and rescue?
Abominable! He didn’t even say hello.
I'm sorry, Jason, but I have to follow my heart.
You begged me to come with you, but you F O R G O T your camera!
Wait. I thought YOU brought the cellphone.
I said we're engaged.
If you must know, it's because his back isn't as hairy as yours!
Big surprise that we forgot to bring the camera.
Don't worry about him - he gets an existential crisis every once in a while.
He had to leave.  He's having lunch with Nessie.
He said, "Frosty's a snowman. I'm a yeti."
He said the LGBTQ community just doesn't​ get "other".
He said he's just a myth.
I heard Mt. Everest is clothing optional, now.
Do you think I should ask for his autograph or play it cool?
Wait a half hour before using the bathroom after him.
It's amazing what you can see with these polarized lenses.
Remember how smug you were when I said I was leaving you for someone over the hill?
He says his real name is "Abdominal"
I wouldn't bother. I was just up there and there is not much to see.
Nope, he is not the least interested in coming to work for Trump.
It's not what you think.  I love him.
WHAT did you just call me?!
I'm going to be back late, Roger.
We've got to stop meeting like this.  I think he's suspicious.
Do you mind if I join him?
His feet aren't all that big if you know what I mean.
Whatever you’ve heard about us, it’s only a rumor.
And yet he loves me
Yeah, well the stench is real too. I'm heading back.
I'll bet you believe in the Tooth Fairy, too.
That was cold, Larry.
He said he's going where there are fewer tourists.
He says, after a few seasons, your body adapts to the climate at the naturist park.
Yada, Yada, Yeti. Next you'll say you see my aunt Sophie.
It’s over, I swear! I ‘m pretty sure he’ll just walk away and I’ll never see him again.
No, I assure you Phil, he's just a friend.
Is there ANYWHERE I can go where you won’t follow ?
Oh way to go Tom!... You know you really need to educate yourself on mythical creature stereotyping and how it's utilized by those in power to perpetuate a mytho-normative society."
I think I now understand why you don't like asking for directions.
Really? Well I think your attitude is abominable.
He said it’s Yanni. Now pay up.
He said we missed the turn.
You treated him abominably.
Calls himself "Sir Edmund Hairily...'"
I'm sorry, Kevin, but this is the man I've waited for my whole life.
When we get to Sasquatch's cave, you better not start in with any of your Fox News, anti-Endangered Species Act, 2nd Amendment banter. If you do, so help me God, I will leave you here to be eaten alive.
He may know the mountain but that doesn't mean we should follow him
Should we follow him? He seems to know the way.
You're imagining things: I've kept my affairs within our species!
Because when you lead you get distracted and--look at me--and something inevitably gets missed.
It's been fun, but I've found someone hairier.
Prank call. He didn’t order the pizza.
He said, 'Tell Trump he better start worrying about global warming or he'll quickly learn who's actually abominable.'
Why did you say that? I think you hurt his feelings.
Really! Just someone I met at work.
George, trust me, that is NOT a Sherpa.
He's not so abominable;he gave us the peace sign.
It's true what they say about men with big hands and feet.
Grab your phone, this could be trending for a least an afternoon.
Of course he's offended. I can't believe you called him a Yeti.
He said we should have made a left at Everest to get to the Starbucks.
He comes on to me, I say no and he walks away.  I mean, #yetisarerealmen.
He said he was a little lost himself,
he is trying a new path to work
I only spoke with him for a minute but he didn’t seem abominable
P.S., his foot isn't his biggest part.
I think I ate too much of the cookie.
I think we should just ask him!!
Why does Joe think no one will notice the zipper on that stupid gorilla suit?
That's your problem, Roger, you're always so jealous if I look at another guy.
I told you this was a clothing optional trail.
Let that be an example to you why back hair is non-negotiable.
He just takes better care of me out here
Small hands. Small feet. Cold weather. You do the math.
I told you we’re just friends
My Nepali is rusty...I think he said 'Hirsute Only Beyond This Point' ..
Hold up, he forgot his phone.
He said we can't get there from here.
He promised an announcement on his candidacy 'very soon.'
Best guide I've ever had.
Let's ask him if he knows anything about the Loch Ness Monster.
I told you that was Elvis that passed us at the last summit!
I  promise ..this is not one of those made you look things.
He's the spitting image of my first husband.
You know that thing about big foot, big . . . not true!
He just wanted to know if I knew any girls his age"
We may have named him Yeti, but he prefers Bob.
Abonimable Snow-person!
The wall won't be a challenge to these guys.
His feet look so much smaller in person.
It might be time for prescription sunglasses.
He's one of the locals.
Let it go, John! It wasn’t my worst Wednesday night.
He's actually quite agreeable.
He did indeed call us "F#*!ing puny global warmers"--what, you're surprised?
Wow, turns out we're not the only ones here seeking the path to enlightenment!"
...what luck - says there's a quaint cafe with a gift shop about a mile down from here.
He said he can't be abominable until the government shut-down is over.

They said blind people couldn't scale it, but just look at us!
He started back up when the new congress was sworn in.
The sex is good, but his breath is abominable.
Not Yeti.
I think you treated him abominably!
Nah, that ain’t Sasquatch. He’s much more blurrier.
He said we were abominable.
He wants people to know that he quit Facebook.
Of course I looked at him when he passed by. 
Paranoid...always paranoid
Don’t you think there’s something weird about this mountain guide?
It’s only after two months of Christmas music that he becomes abominable.
If you make me choose, I’m going with the hairy man.
Why am I leaving you?  Size matters dummy!
He’s very sensitive about his feet.
Since the Rogaine he's excersizing more...

He said there's a Starbucks at the summit
It was just a one yeti stand. I'll never see him again.
He says "there's no bathroom at the top".
Ask Him For Directions,He Lives In The Neighborhood!”
Sorry but I can't resist a man with a hairy back.
Never mind.  He's just a Deplorable Snowman.
Sorry, Harvey.  I don't just like Bad Boys. I like the truly Abominable ones.
Well, he is a bit taciturn. Yet he is more aloof than abominable.
I'm staying Mick!  Sure, he only knows four words, but none of them are "Trump"!
Lately, it seems my grip on reality is going downhill.
It's not hypoxia.  He took my breath away.
His hands are also quite large.
He said he was doing research on, “The Ascent of Man.”
He's invited us for lunch.
Let’s face it, what you said was abominable.
He's only starting an exploratory committee now, but he'll declare officially in the spring.
Time to turn around.
Wait -- if that's not Larry and he's not wearing an L.L. Bean snow suit, then who is it?
Follow that guy. Pretty sure he can show you the way to Extinction.
He is abominable. Yet I love him.

When you shave, it grows back thicker.
He said "Because it's there."

Good thing we wore sunglasses, he didn't recognize us.
I'm not sure either why we're in a cartoon with no possible funny caption
A whole bunch of them are protesting  this week at the summit. They've had it with  the  "Big Foot" and "Abomidable" name-calling.
He may be Abominable but when we’re together he takes me over the top.
Something about Pokémon Go.
On his way to work, “scaring the crap out of skiers “.

Our next Sherpa will have big shoes to fill.
If this wasn't in the New Yorker, I'd make a fart joke.
Maybe a little sketchy but I wouldn’t say abominable.
All I said was that he put on a few pounds. Sheesh!
He was complaining about all the tabloid "fake news" about him.  I said "get in line"!

I guess he's gone vegan.
Sorry Ralph, it's just that his feet are bigger , if you catch my drift.

You don't have to worry; paleo guys aren't my type.
Yet he walks.
Hurry back! Hurry back! Not "hairy back", you idiot! Now we'll never find our way off this mountain.

He's a Himalayan and I miss the Rockies - it just wasn't going to work.....
He asked me who shot J.R. I told him I had no idea.
Sorry, Brad. Love is where you find it.
Well, that’s a relief. I thought we’d be underdressed.
1) Now, do you believe me?
2) Told you so!
3) When Hairy met Sally.
Yeah, but his manners are abominable
Too bad we forgot our phones, we could’ve had him take a picture for social media to let people know we hiked.
Why can't you be more abominable?
It shrinks?
I hate tourist season.
Jason, believe me, we're just friends. He means nothing to me -- honestly!

I was NOT flirting.  
Your jealousy can be so abominable.

Amateurs...
He said if we tag him he's going to unfriend us
I told him, waxing might help.
He's free-range. You?
Just because I'm leaving him for you doesn't make him abominable.
Claims he saw me in Frisco. I've never even been to Frisco!
Well that was rude!
He can't pose now.  He's having an abominable hair day.
Honest! All I did was make a joke about how bad Trump's presidency is. Who knew that HE is part of the guy's base?
He said it's unlikely we catch up to Sisyphus.
Why me? He's your roommate, you go after him.
He said we can follow him to the summit Starbucks.
He invited me for Netflix and chill.

I have to go - we are having drinks with Bigfoot and Sasquatch.
That was the maitre de. He says they're ALWAYS closed on Mondays.
He says he’s going back to where it’s civilized!
He's looking for wifi.
This blind mountaineering trip was a cool idea! I wonder what we're missing?
With the government shut down and all...he decided to just head back home!
Did you have to humiliate him by calling attention to his foot size?
He may be abominable, but at least he's a man.
After all this time, all he wanted was to just say hi.
He said we should have taken a left at the last crevasse
How could you forget the camera, they won't believe we reached the summit !
23andMe said I am 2% Yeti and your mom says I’m abominable.

He says the nearest Starbucks about three miles southwest...
Look Todd, I just want a man with a little more mystique...goodbye.
He said a brown loafer in size 27 1/2.
He tells me he knows where Jimmy Hoffa is buried.
How hard was it to find this guide?
I don't care about your getting back to nature! This is why we NEVER leave home without our phones anymore!
Sure, we dated for awhile, but that’s over now.
I don’t know....my last hiking partner left some pretty big shoes to fill.
You can be so abominable yourself sometimes.
If you would have used the politically correct term, 'Large Lower Extremity' , he wouldn't have been so offended.
You're the abominable one!
Should we just follow your dad?
What are the chances of running into each up here!
He was asking for directions to Sunglass Hut.
I told you Greg, I’m with Steve now.
There will be no further statement at this time.
I'm sure He knows where he's going.
What did you say to make him feel bad?
He was very happy. I convinced him he was not Abominable.
Don't trust him, he doesn't even have the right gear.
Yes, I saw him,Todd. And no, I don't think any less of you. Now can we finally focus on me?
Of course not. He asked, but I told him I have a boyfriend.
It was long ago.
I'm sorry - but he has bigger feet
JUST Loch Ness left to see.
He says that troop 6000 stopped by yesterday, so unless we have Thin Mints we should take a hike.
Is there a word for how rude that...that...snowman was?
He says since global warming took a turn for the worse, he's
going to wait us out.
I think he said something about getting out more and trying to seem less abominable.
He left the oven on.
Did you have to say "Abominable"?
I'm sorry John, I HAVE to go with him
Sorry, but he’s invited me to go see his etchings.
No John, he said he hungers for visitors.
No clue. He said it was 'adorable snowman,' and then split.
He says any white grape AOP Savoie wine at Midmountain Chalet  will be excellent.
Let’s just let that one pass!
I can't put my foot on it, exactly, but I think 'elusive' sums up our guide's character nicely.
It can't be real Bob, see, it left no footprints."
I didn‘t catch it all. Sounds like a pretty major speech impediment.
He said he can't help us up to the summit.  Evidently, he has the flu and feels abominable.
For Pete's sake! Can't we go on a simple date together without your Yeti friend tagging along?!
Of course he’s upset, you said he was abominable!
Yep, we are so high!
He's the Abominable Snowman impersonator I told you about.
I met him in Vegas.
He really wishes you would stop calling him abominable.
He said because of climate change he's becoming the Abdominal No-man.
James, for the millionth time Yetis are not real.  Can we just keep walking.
He said he’s sorry, but he’s not into threesomes.
This is why I told you I prefer the Bahamas!
At first he was angry, but then I let him know the value on his cave was about to skyrocket.
He just wants to show me his etchings.....
No, Dad, calling my boy friend "abominable" is racist.
I asked him if he’d ever considered a body wax.
I thought you said he knew the way.
Now that we’ve settled that, I want us to talk about why I still believe there’s income inequality.
Don't worry. He's got 5 stars on Yelp.
I've never seen him in my life, I swear!
Downhill with you or follow my bliss...?
Not nearly as abominable as you!
Can you believe it? I know, no gear!
He prefers "Sasquatch".
I know he looks a little rough around the edges, but he’s got a big heart.
Abominable" is in the eyes of the beholder
He was Secretary of something or other.
Do you think he spotted us?
I asked, but he didn't want to sign my Yeti water bottle
And I still say he flashed me.
Also a jerk. I guess I''ll just get back on Tinder.
He believes our Yeti tumblers are an infringement of his copyright.
It's no use, Brad.  I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
He promised he'd write

I told him it’s over, yeti can’t stop meeting me.
Can’t you just savour the moment for one second Howard and stop thinking about your Instagram content.
He asked for directions to the White House.
Big mouth – our guide just quit! Now you've got big shoes to fill.
How would you like to be called abominable?
He says the difficult part is coming back down
Isn’t that the guy who makes those coolers?
We discussed movie and book deals, but he wants control of his likeness.
So much for big feet big...
So great bumping in to you up here.  No, not much new with me I can see mentioning.
Ugh...why didn't you ask him for directions Todd?
He says he's Sisyphus, but something's wrong.
He said to just follow in his footsteps
It's not him, the hands are too small...
And he says you’re abominable, Jim.
You go with him, let me know how it works out for you.
Altitude training may result in unusual side effects. Consult your doctor or physician if you have any concerns.
I suppose you’ll tell me the sky is falling next?
I'm sorry, I can't explain it.  I just have to follow him.
Too be honest, Dave, I prefer a man with more hair on his chest.
Not worth the trouble. He’ll still be President when you come down.
Sorry, but I like men with big feet.
Are you here for the Bigfoot meetup group?
I don't care if he knows a shortcut, I'm tired of talking about Harry and the Hendersons.
Tindr had him miles away.
I told you it said its preferred pronouns are they, them, their!"
It said we can use its wifi.
Yet he persists, unlike you
He would like us to join him for lunch.
Bob: What do you mean it's over?
Mary: Have you seen the size of his feet?
Who cares about communing with nature! We could have gone viral!
It's the next thing in smart wool
I​ guess it's not true​ what they say about males with big feet.
He told me that he’s a figment of our imagination.
He's upset you called him abominable.
I just called him Sasquatch....I think I might have put my Big Foot in it.....
I didn't think he was abominable at all.
It's true.
Why did you have to tell him he was abominable?
Why are you so surprised to see him?  He had to lose the orange hair and find someplace to hide out.
There's no doubt that ONE of you is being abominable.
He says there is a Starbucks at the peak!
I think the air must be getting thin!
His Facebook feed made him seem so much nicer.
Hey, just remember that he promised a selfie with you at the top
Of course he wouldn’t wear pants, I just didn’t think it through is all.
It’s over Perry. I’ve moved on.
No, I did not used to date that guy.
Dammit.
I forgot my phone!
Remember when we did not see the basketball playing gorilla ?
He didn't even say hello. That's abominable!
Yet i still don't believe.
He says he's going to the White House for a job interview with Trump.
It's true what they say about a snowman with big feet.
If you think that's an impressive sight, wait till you get to the top.
The docs seem to think it a testerone issue.
You know what else is abominable? This conversation.
He says take a hard left, next mountain over, the Starbucks is a couple of hundred feet up on the right.
He didn't find me abominable enough.
Personally, I didn't think he behaved that abominably.
Someone had to be his first!
I'll tell you what's abominable, your sense sense of direction!
I've met someone, Dave, and he promised me a fur coat to keep me warm...
Sorry, Lyle.  It's those big feet and well ... the grunting. They're irresistible
He said we need to remove our shoes before we enter his home.
It's true what they say about foot size being an 'indicator' . . .
Yes it's real fur but he was born with it
This Sherpa guide is way bigger than the last one.
All I know is that he said is to just call him Big Foot and he’s a Pisces.
I told you we should have asked for directions!
You’ve obviously offended him by calling him Bigfoot
Yeah? I’ll tell you what’s abominable, he’s gonna get there first!
I think he wanted to know if this is Saskatchewan...
He said that he’s looking for a WiFi hotspot.

What if he doesn't like having his picture taken?
I told you that REI had a new line of natural fiber outerwear.
He wants me to launch a 2020 presidential exploratory committee.
Well we are in the French Alps, honey.
He said you are making things awkward, so maybe I go it alone from here
If it's not a UFO, I'm not turning!
The Sherpa turned back so I improvised.
He went down seeking a wise mam and couldn't find one.
Okay, okay! I'm the one who farted.
Everytime I come here there's nothing new to see,  just snow and more snow.
Wow, you are the LAST person I thgouht I'd run into on this adventure.
Way to go, you’ve hurt his feelings, again.
He just escaped a close shave.
He said he's never seen anything like it...no footprints...anywhere!
You really can’t expect him to wear the red suit and hat all year long
He seemed very pleasant, not abominable at all.
I didn't see any footprints...did you?
I don't think he's dangerous. Besides, he's going the same direction we are.
He'll be right back with a trail map."
Carl, your jealousy is going to ruin this relationship.
He said it's neither goose down nor synthetic.
He may be fictional, but he's a real man.
He wanted to know if the FED was going to continue to raise interest rates.
We really shouldn't be hiking - we're both blind.
He said - “Not digging this “global warming””
I don't care who that is, I am not following that hairy butt up this mountain!
So what if I assume most abominable creatures are men?
I must be hallucinating- thought my mother in law just walked by.
Actually, he’s a pretty nice guy.
He thinks he left his oven on.
For the last time -- my feelings for you had nothing to do with the size of your feet.
Being blind-always feel like I'm missing something
What if the yellow snow writing message was his?
He says he has to go home for lunch.
He's right - calling him that is just body-shaming.
He's lost, he wanted directions.
You are so not evolved.
Sorry, there’s not much to see at the top. Just a bunch of Neanderthals.
Wait till you meet his dog Big Tail.
He says that he will check to see if the guru at the top can work us in.
I came up here to escape white male privilege!
Unbelievable, I mean, how many years have we been searching for this guy...and not even a ‘stop n chat’?!
He might be abominable but he's got a great WiFi connection up there!
Of course he's ahead of us.  He's got big feet!
We've been over this, he gets sensitive about the 'abominable' thing.
It was just a one-time thing.
Where can I get a Day-After pill?
For me, it's as if he never existed.
Is this your idea of taking our relationship back to the beginning?
He said we're still about an hour from the summit.
It's true. He is abominable.
I never expected to see you here.
He said the best is Yeti to come!
At least he’s not giving up!!!
Are you kidding me?  He wouldn’t even make eye contact!
He’s not the only one around here who’s abominable!
He said,"No selfies today."
He said to wait here until he sees if his wife is home.
Do you really have to ask 'Why?'
I leaving you Louis. You just don’t have his WOW factor.
There goes our trail mix!
Who knew he does Sherpa work on the side?
Way to go Bill....you know he's easily triggered
I’ll tell you what’s abominable - there’s no wi-fi!
Just because he's Tibetan doesn't make him a sherpa.
He wasn't at all abominable . . .
Nice guy
Let's follow him, he's a Thru-Hiker
I told you we are through!  You’re following me is hurting my new relationship!
Maybe the trail to extinction is uphill
Is it just me? Or, are things getting a little hairy around here?
I'm in love, Jake. Goodbye!
As first dates go, it was pretty abominable.
Did you see that?!"  "Science has lead me to believe that I did not.
He's not really abominable, you know. He's just pissed
at the paparazzi.
When we get to the top we turn left.
You’re not going to believe this and don’t turn around right now...Frank is here.
He said they just opened up a Starbucks Reserve up there
Maybe all our fancy equipment isn’t necessary after all.
I'll believe in global warming when I see a Yeti in the desert...
Dammit, Dave, he said "no selfies!"
He is going to build a wall.
I'm sorry, Rolf.  I'm just tired of the manscaped look.
He told me I have tiny hands and then just kept on walking.
Well, at least I didn’t forget the camera.
But, babe, he says he knows all the good ski spots.
He says that there's a Starbucks beyond the next rise!!
He's not really that abominable and it's a great workout.
I know our sherpa is a local but frankly I find him abominable .
I suppose what they say about big feet is the actual myth.
I'm thinking 2020...
He's not abominable. Actually rather nice.
Actually, it's your pace that is abominable.
It's his 30-day Challenge.
He looked hurt when I told him Washington has much scarier creatures than him.
You got my tumbler autographed, right?
We can point fingers and assign blame or we can be mature adults and admit we always knew it would come to this.
He said mountain climbing has strengthened his midriff. so much, he's now the Abdominal Snowman.
Honey, don’t argue with the man ... he is the expert after all.
Climate change!
The ménage a trois was fun, but I am staying with him.
I'm surprised how small his foot is.
As far as holy men, I asked him who's at the top?   All he said was "dinner".
At least he’s up front about being abominable!
He said “see you around” but somehow I doubt that.
Do you smell Beef Jerky?
Oh now you’re not into my no cell phone idea?

He’s abominable AND rude.
I’m sorry, Larry, but his is big.
He told me he just got back from a trip to Loch Ness.

He says he's going up there to contemplate his existence.
He said it's 'abdominal,' not 'abominable.'
What did you say to piss him off?
He says he's related to Donald Trump, but that we shouldn't hold that against him.
Who needs a GPS? Follow that Yeti!
When I asked him if there were sufficient grounds for impeachment, he said, " Not Yeti. "
He forgot his phone."
Don't worry, mom'll be back once she eats her Snickers bar.
No deal.
He said calling him abominable hurts his feelings.
It’s true!!! You can tell how big he is by the size of his feet!
He'll be right back. He forgot his cooler.
Oh...he's was cool but certainly no Big Foot if you know what I mean
Welcome to the Political Wilderness!  If you look to your right you'll see Steve Bannon.
He has my number, but I just have a feeling he'll never call.
Bigfoot without the footprints?
He told me the chai isn't worth the journey.
No no that's the Indomitable Snowman. Different guy entirely. You want to get to the top, doncha?
Your sense of direction is abominable.
The sex was abominable.
He's looking for his Uber ride.
Apparently he'd rather not be called abominable anymore.
The "Abominable Snowman" was so last year, he prefers "Yeti" now!
We should've just asked one of the locals for directions.
The guru's appointment secretary says he can see us soon, just not yeti.
Well, at least his sense of direction isn't abominable.
He ain't Yeti, he's my lover
Well.. from his perspective I’m aiming lower by choosing to date you
It was a Tinder date that didn't work out.
Don't leave me for him! Not yeti!
He wants us to spread the word that he's not abominable.
That's right, Milo, I love him. I love him even though he's abomidibible. I mean abombbable...abobmable...oh, fuck it.
Is asking for directions really so abominable?
Can you believe it? He says there’s no wifi up here.
If it makes you feel better then, yes, it was all about his big feet.
he told me climate change was fake news
Goodbye, John. Oh, one more thing. I could never stand your aftershave.
Me? You’re the one who said, “Go take a hike.”
He was pretty  compelling, and your reasons for going back with you are ?
He advises us to Make America Great Again.
He said that peak to the right IS Everest.
Look Debbie, its the Ex President. He still trying to find money for the wall
Did you post it on Instagram?"
"I forgot my charger.
Asked only if we could change nickname from ‘abominable’ to ‘indifferent’ snowman.
Typical Conroy: you bring your selfie stick and leave your camera at the hotel!
all i said was "how about a selfie?"
Now look what you've done!
Yeah, I got a selfie with him, but my hair looks abominable.
The regular guru is off Wednesdays.
Oh, so THAT'S noticeable, but my haircuts are not?
I must say he didn't seem abominable
Bob, we were supposed to tell him about the adoption AFTER we climbed the mountain.
I didn't find him abominable at all.
Shaved heads, then body tats, then the milennial whiskers !!
Now it's the body beard  !!!
His feet don't look that big to me.
He mentioned something about forgetting his keys.
I think he's adorable.
Now don't start something.  He's just a friend.

I am going with him.... and yes, it is a hairy ass thing."
He doesn't seem too surprised to see us.

He prefers to be called simply, 'Mr. Snowman.'
Forgot the cooler.
Can you believe it!  After 9 hours, my wash-and-wear slacks have kept their crease!
Once you go Yeti, you never go back.
I am sorry Dave, if you get the chance to sleep with Big Foot you are not going to not do it
That's racist!

Was it something I said?
I don’t care what you think. Yelp gave this tour 4 and half stars.
He's what passes for Uber up here. I gave him five stars not being talkative.

When you finally find your perfect Tinder match and she dumps you for a taller dude.
Yeah.  We used to hang out in high school.

The sherpas are all on strike.
Go back John. He had me at his first grunt!
I hope I’m not pregnant

There's no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.
Three's a crowd.
Good news! He says that you aren’t imaginary!
This climb looks a little hairy.
He said the Grinch was a weenie.
You know, he's not as abominable as everyone says.
I told you it’s Sasquatch, he hates it when people call him Bigfoot.
Are you going to let him get away with that abominable comment?
No honey, that's Zombies that eat brains...
I told him a roll in the snow was not a relationship. His 'foot' size may be spectacular but it's not enough.
Guess he doesn't shop at R.E.I. for outerwear.
He wouldn't even pose with me for a selfie, its almost like he doesn't know that if you are not on social media, you are not real
Now he's going to get photos of his grandson...let's just try the climb tomorrow.
He is so famous, I don't know what to say...
I feel like I'm in the middle of a New York Times crossword.
She said her name is Liesl...
He told me that if you add a fourth term to that right-angled-triangle theorem but for it you use a minus sign, then that is the geometry of the Universe.
He knows where he’s going, Eric! Just look at him, I’m pretty sure he’s a native.
Look, he's a great guide so keep the "abominable" stereotype to yourself.
Nice guy, but wouldn't let me take a photo.
He said, "Next time, bring lattes."
You feel  threatened because I said  he was kind of cute?
Orange hair?
He says, "Abominable is as abominable does."
That is not NorthFace, that has Patagonia written all over it!
No wonder he’s insulted, after what you called him.
We can still be friends and everything, but you know what they say about the size of a man's feet?
He's not happy about the pay freeze.
He said: "Wait here, I'm getting dipping sauce."
Are we there yeti?
He told me to “walk this way”.
He said he's only a size 12.
Your friends are abominable.
You’ll never believe it, but that’s my ex.
Trust me, his tours are one of a kind.
Turn back quick.  It's a GOP convention.
He says it’s all downhill from here
I told him to get lost.
I told you we should have done the Paleo diet.
I'm leaving you for someone with more testosterone!
He said he needs his selfie stick first
Let's get some attention and report it as fake news.
See!?  I told you we would be overdressed up here.
Are we almost there yeti?
Of course he's angry, Zack. You keep trying to stick carrots into him.
I thought his feet looked proportional
It’s the altitude; I’m seeing things also.
You both can't be abominable
He only asked to be called Mr. Yeti, not to debate the science behind his existence.
Seriously, I do not want to be downwind of that guy.
Wow look at those birds!
He said to go back down and get him razors,shave cream and wine.
He is abominable, that's why we need a border wall!
Just leave him alone. He's having a bad hair day.
I'm so surprised! He smelled "Mountain Fresh"!
He's just the Yeti Welcoming Committee. You meet the whole clan at the top.
I see it, yet I don't believe it.
He only speaks Latin.
That sure was a chilly reception!
He's angry because I said "Ready, Get Yeti, Go!"
We have followed in their footsteps for thousands of years, why  stop now!
Back to the original Man Cave?
You never mentioned your friend Fred was an exhibitionist.
He expressed discomfort with the idea of a threesome.
He's says it's okay but no Trump jokes.
I just want to be with someone who’s willing to let themselves be seen every once in a while.
What goes up must come down. RUN!
Of course I’m following him. Did you see the size of his feet??
He said he feels naked - he's off to get his sunglasses.
I told you, never ask a creature its shoe size!
Your jealousy is abomidable.
I only asked if we could do a selfie together!
I think he knows where he's going.
Last one to the top is a monkey’s uncle
He can't find a Starbucks either.
He seemed a bit overly eager, but I suppose I’m game if you are.
He says he’ll eat us at the top.
It's your turn to small talk with him.
No, in fact he's quite personable.
It's another victim of climate change.
This guide is abominable - he could have at least put some pants on!
Once the conversation turned to politics, he just became abominable.
He said he's fed up with being "othered."
I'm sorry Ted, but your just not abominable enough.
Well, I think it's abominable of  YOU to assume it's a snow MAN.
No, I wouldn’t say this is a hairy situation
His climbing skills are unreal.
You know he gets touchy about his bald spot.
You didn't have to say his fur was matted!
I swear that man passed us a mile back!
He says he knows the best place for us to take a selfie.
No that's cool, you can wait dong here. I mean down hairy. I mean down here. Just set up cock. I mean camp. It'll be all white. Sigh. SEE YOU FIVE MINUTES.
I told him no means no
It's not you, Chad...
Focus! No.We're looking for Loch Ness.
I thought so too, but he said he's just a Sherpa.
Wasn’t that the guy we saw arm wrestling for drinks at the bar last night?
"He didn't even say 'hi' to us.  I heard he was abominable, but I didn't know he was rude!
You said whoever I married would have big shoes to  fill, Daddy.
My tweet just went viral. @realDonaldTrump said, 
“It’s deepfake. You’re Obamanable!”
He got pissed when I told him I was already seeing someone...
Well, the brochure didn't mention anything about this.
I got a deal on this Sherpa by using Groupon
I fell for him when he was just Little Foot.
Every year the other hikers look less and less prepared.
He said the restaurant at the summit is abominable.
You have to hand it to LL Bean. They have some great climbing gear!
Not too happy about climate change!
He understands me. He completes me.
It's President Trump.  He said at least now when people call him 'abominable', they'll be right.
You're cold and insensitive and you've hurt his feelings.
He can't find his Uggs.
If you must know, he’s makes me laugh at 10k feet.
He said he wants to take us to his cave to eat.
He turned around as soon as I mentioned #MeToo.
But we were only talking
He's not abominable, he's actually likable & makes great hot cocoa.
He said he's not into three-ways. See you later.
I think he’ll be an excellent tour guide.
I don't think he appreciated 'abominable' OR 'wookie'.
He said the most instagrammable spot was this way!
Are you sure he's accredited by the American Mountain Guides Association?
Can't believe I fell for the stereotypes.
You ain't seen nothin Yet...i
Until Trump is gone
He’s the new union rep for the Sherpas
They’re closed.
What do you mean you didn't ask him to take a selfie with you?
He says he's only a size 14 but his uncle has a really big foot.
He says trail mix is for sissies.
He was a Sherpa on Mom's Everest climb in 1990.
He may be abominable but it's overwhelmingly evident he's also a stud.
But you've always wanted an emotional support yeti.
Seems like a shy guy, I guess he got cold feet.
Look, all I’m saying is 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor and an endorsement for ‘excellent conversation’ isn’t everything.
I paid extra to hike the "Evolution Trail"
I guess that means no selfies.
Poor Norbert....... the government shut down ended his anti-yeti medication
Said it’s his own, not Patagonia”.
He just said there is nothing much to see up there
Go ahead, ask him for a selfie!
You didn't have to insult him!
He took my camera.
He is the least "abominable" man I have been with in years.
Was I too much of a fanboy?
That’s something you don’t see every day.
C'mon. We can't let THAT guy beat us.
Maybe we should have continued the paleo diet any way.
He said, clothing is optional at this altitude here.
I told you we should have called him Mr. Yeti.
Steve, I'm going with him because I'm a geneticist...and I won' t mix business with pleasure.
He was just wondering if Ronald Reagan was still president!
Whoa. Did you see the size of that guy’s feet?
Sure he’s abominable but you really shouldn’t have brought up his mother
At least he's willing to work on a smaller footprint.
All I said was "two's company; three's a crowd."
He said "Walk this way." That can be taken two ways.
I say we just keep following him.
He's offended that your only recollection of him was fuzzy.
He didn't even say hello
Now I understand why he is always so hard to track . . . . he doesn't leave any tracks in the snow.
He said his name is Sisiphos and he's  sick and tired of chasing that boulder.
You were right! He said the nude beach is over this hill.
Because he has bigger hands!
I  told you he answers to “yeti” not “abominable”
I’m sorry, but it’s true; he’s a real mountain man.
Was surprising to see the yeti, but was even more surprising to hear him whistling the theme song from Game of Thrones.
-You- tell him to shave his back
He says it’s closed on Saturday.
Whaddya mean we need to see other people?
Our past has caught up with us.
I think this high altitude is really starting to get to me
Remember: It's not your eyes--it's the oxygen which determines what you see in the mountains.
He asked if we saw his friend  Bigfoot.
If the Yeti doesn't need a hiking partner, neither do I!
Do you have any singles for a tip?
This hike will put some hair on your chest
I am so turned on!  Let's never shave again!
See, he has no walking stick!
And he's got a beer cooler that doesn't cost $500.
Never mind. He always does this when people are around.
He says the queue for the hermit guru is pretty long, but at least there’s a Starbucks with wi-fi next door.
No, I'm not attracted to him.  He is just the best choice for getting us to the top!
He’s upset with the filter you used, he says it makes him look, “washed out”
No, the correct usage is, "Yet I saw something".
She just wants to be alone.
Don't be racist.  Actually, he reminds me of your brother Donald.
I think he expects a tip.
I told him the government is still shut down.
‘Do you believe that guy? No ropes, no poles, not even spiked snowshoes.’
He wasn't going to let us continue until I convinced him we understand that global warming is a serious problem.
He told me he's here investigating a bigfoot sighting.
Are you following me?
Nice man, but his breath was abominable.
Sorry, I’m done with his cave man mentality.
He's from our tour, but they made him fly cargo.
Yeah, he may be abominable, but at least he isn't you.
Dude was bald until he bought the Donald Trump Hairgrow elixir.
You haven't been teasing him again have you?
He said take the next crevice on the right
He is just not used to taking criticism.
See I told you this would be worth the Instagram.
He has big feet, too?
He’s such old Fake News.
Back off, Jared. He's my dad, and I don't care if he has a full-body comb-over.
Nothing is Abominable in Trump Times
And YET-I can't believe what I just saw!
I’m not taking another step until he stops singing ‘Ice Ice Baby’.
Turns out they're just hairy men waiting for the look to come back.
He's much friendlier than I thought he would be.
He invited us for tea.
He says he got the outfit from REI.
He said "follow me".  Should we?
God damn tourists!
She said she'd go back up and get my hiking stick for me.
The big guy said he really needed a cup of coffee and directions to the nearest Starbucks.
Don't you love being alone with nature?
Didn’t I tell you to charge the phone before we left?
He is mumbling about the futility of pushing snow balls up the mountain
Maybe he's on the Paleo diet.
He wants to know if we've seen his remote.
He's tired of people commenting on his feet.
Big feet, big hands....
Can you see the top?"
"No, but I can see the bottom.
Toxic masculinity
Sorry Bob, but I’m leaving with him.
He’s just a passing acquaintance.
He understands me.
He said that total consciousness is just up this way.
He's conflicted about coming out.
We’re just at different points in our lives”
He knows the mountain all right, but I don't like a guide who grunts.
Yes, I'm leaving you for him because he's not into Games of Thrones.
That is the last time I ask the natives for directions!
He said he's looking for some sense in the world.
Yeah, so he says to make two lefts and then a right to get to the Marriott.
The poor dear was invited to testify before a Fox News panel about  Global Warming and how it's negatively-impacted the local Hunting and Gathering Industry, which led to a lively discussion about the myth of White Privilege.
I didn't even know there was a mobile home park up here.
I told him it's called the Paleo diet fo a reason.
He stopped and asked me to text LL Bean to let them know he's not happy with their new limited return product policy."
He could have at least said excuse me.
If I understood him correctly, he says global warming sucks and his feet really aren't that big!
And here I thought we had to wear layers.
We had a great conversation... I think he's just misunderstood.
I don’t think he’s abominable at all.
Really, Jason. You hurt his feelings. He’s a little slow—but “abominable”?
Look, I get that you’re a sensitive, woke male. But at 14,000 feet, I’ll take 7 foot of hairy, pure testosterone.
I couldn't wait for you any longer, Howard. I'm leaving you. I need a man who can keep up.  And, well, you know what they say about guys with big feet...
Yeah, he's been on the move since climate changed
He said he’s going back for something a little warmer.
He gave me a message for Matthew Whitaker.
This is where they said they'd spotted him, right?
Now who you goin' to believe?  Me, or your lyin' eyes?
Go back.  We missed a turn.
You never believed in me either,really.  I'm not going back with you,I'm staying here with him.
I wanted to walk a mile in his shoes, but I couldn't find any size 28s.
I told him he could possibly find shoes his size on line.
He has got to get his steps in
He said he doesn’t love me anymore and he’s going home to mother
He said it’s only a few miles before we reach the Starbucks.
It's over, Kevin; I never cared about the man-scaping.
It’s a beast of a climb!
This may not be the best time to tell you that I met someone who is changing my path
And yet I... And yet I...  I forgot what I was going to say.
He didn’t seem so bad.
But you promised, no family!
I think he said, "Wus."
He said he wasn't photogenic.
He said for us to tun back. It's abominable up there.
He said he needs to ask the guru a question.
He wants to fight you for me.
He said he came here because it's here.
He said the end is near.
Fifty bucks for one signed glossy!
No, there's no such thing!
Walk THIS way
Yeti does have a certain air about him....
It's an uphill battle to attempt Everest blind, but I can tell something big is afoot.
It's a big feat, making it to the top.
Well, first off his wardrobe is simpler
I see everything's in proportion...
He says he was by far the best president yeti.
Don't worry. It's not serious.  He's not even my species.
He could've been spared the back hair comments.
No, I didn't ask where she was from. She was pretty miffed about the wording of my first question.
He unfriended me.
He got offended when I  called him “abominable.”
He's requested a mountain summit meeting. I hope there's coffee.
I don't care if you never see him. 
This was supposed to be just the two of us.
He took it pretty well. Just said, 'he's got big shoes to fill.'
He’s a marketing manager for Yeti.
He looks like he knows where he's going....
He said we should have turned right in Albuquerque.
Is that him? He's much hairier than in his profile picture.
Actually, we met at Starbuck's.
Sorry Darling. I've been meaning to tell you
You said you wanted an adventure vacation!
Boy,talk about your cold shoulder.
Yes, there is someone else!
He said something about Trump being more disliked than he is
Hirsute or Hair suit?
We haven't hiked together since he behaved so abominably the first time.
To go any higher,I need my Support Yeti.
No. I’ve told you a dozen times, that Sasquatch joke is offensive!
He said the air's abominable down there.
He just needed to use my cell for a quick call. Said he lost his down a crevasse last week.
Thank God we are blind!
A guy that smelly MUST be ugly.
I’m going with him!!
He’s still looking for Bigfoot.
How many times do I need to tell you, Bigfoot isn't real, there are no UFOs, and my sculpting is not just a hobby!
He totally confused hirsute and hairsuit.
He said you’re whistling too loudly.
Wow, Mike, that remark was cold, even by his standards.
I told him keep going, ya can't miss it!
We're invited to tonight's snowball fight.
You can't compare yourself.  He lives here.
He is upset that he receives no royalties from the premium cooler company that bears his name.
He said he won't play college football unless he's paid.
I think Ancestry was right - -and my Father and Uncle both had big feet.
Of course he's not going to pose for a selfie with you!
That new Patagonia fur suit really proves to be warm in this climate!
These sunglasses are great, but I feel we're missing out on the big picture.
Thank god for your beef jerky, I thought I was a goner!
He wanted to know if we were interested in a reverse mortgage
You forgot the cash?  He won't sign without an advance.
Wait. Julie Andrews is still alive?
His climbing skills are legend.
I told you not to bring up climate change with him ... he swears it's a total myth!
Are you high?!?
Actually, he's a pretty nice guy. However, he says his cousin is abominable.
There's no such thing as Trumpfoot.
George, he just called my climbing technique abominable.
No worries, he’s breaking trail.
Can you believe he’s not on Facebook?
He survives by bit parts in Christmas specials.
Dear John, it's complicated ...
At least he doesn't complain about the altitude.
He says the view is better on the other side of the mountain.
Border security just isn't an issue that I am passionate about.
...Yeti, yeti, yeti...yadayadayada
See?  It's not just me; only Julie Andrews can sing that song properly.
No matter how far we travel, we just can't seem to get some me and you time.
Yeah,he's not doing the Animal Planet special anymore. He got cold feet.
How dare you call him abominable!
I am sorry Brad, but he‘s my King Kong
He's already signed a 4-picture deal.
He said to bring orthotics.
I told you not to mention ICE in front of him.
She saw her shadow. Looks like you white guys have another ten years.
I told him there’s snacks at the top.
I’m pretty sure his directions are trustworthy.
Streaking on Mt. Everest? come on!
If your ancestor can make it to the top, so can you!
I hope you're taking plenty of mental pictures, Gary.
He called use abominable people.
Do you think he knows we're following him?
''I think he's squatching us.''
That's oxygen deprivation for you!
We can go up, but no selfies are allowed.
He said no selfies
Ok. Yes.  I have always hated the waxing.
Sure he'e sensitive. He's a young adult with lots of concerns about the environment and its affect on all life on earth. That doesn't make him an abominable snowflake.
Yes, it incredible that he's a Yeti, but can you believe there's a Starbucks up ahead!
I told you not everyone likes North Face.
He said he's sorry for the mess and that he'd be back after theTrump Shutdown. Oh, and to call a plumber.
We've been wandering for three hours following your GPS -- excuse me if I ask a local for directions to the brunch place.
Come on. He's the most highly recommended sherpa in the entire region. 4-5 stars in all the rating guides.
Such obsolete gear.
Definitely worth the extra charge.
He said it's abominable
weather at the top."
He’s just not that into us.
No, apparently, “Sherpa” is considered insensitive.
He said once we reach the summit we should pop over to his place and his wife will get us a nice cup of tea.
I asked her where she bought her fur,
He said his place is just over the top and he'd love to have us come by for a drink if we'd care to.
The listing did say we'd have a superhost.
He said hi and you ignored him. How abominable!
Sorry. He's sensitive about his back hair.
He says it's a stupid hobby.
Well, his feet are big.
Abominable? No, he's one of Trump's deplorables.
He said it's pronounced 'global warning' not 'global warming.'
No, I can't place where I've seen him before.
I hate to disagree with you, but if he really was the Abominable Snowman, don't you think he'd be leaving footprints in the snow so we'd have proof?
If you were looking for Bigfoot he's that-away. This here is a yeti.
He says it's not a competition.
Quick! Get a picture of his footprint!
He said his wife thinks he's cute.
He’s not actually abominable and he’s not actually a snowman, which is more than I can say for you, Ted.
I met him at the co-op, isn't he cool?
The lengths we go for good signal.
I don't know how he does it without a GPS . . .
He said, "Humanity is just too crazy to believe in.
Really, Chad? Your #furreal selfie bomb couldn’t wait until summit?
Calling him abominable was uncalled for.
I tried to explain why he shouldn't wear fur, but he told me he was more concerned with global warming!
What's that abominable smell?
I told him we're vegan...
He is not "abominable!"  But he is shy.
He says follow him if you want to meet the Leprechauns of the Himalayas
He climbs like an animal.
Do you really think he’s seen a bathroom?
How did we end up inside the Toblerone logo?
He's out of granola bars, but he's gonna check if he has any Gatorade.
He said he was leaving 2018 behind with the rest of his gear.
No, you're the one who's abominable."
Turn back! This is my peak experience.
Bringing the camera definitely would have weighed us down
I told you Carol, we don’t need to ask for directions.
OK, it stopped being funny the third time you asked me if i'm enjoying the view!
He'll be right back with the sleds.
He's had it with "civilization".
I guess he’s sick of Yeti puns.
It's shocking. Even after eight episodes of Star Wars this Chewie guy doesn't speak any proper English.
Is that J. Peterman he's wearing?
My new fitness instructor - the abdomenal snowman.
He said he wants to play us some tracks from his new mixtape. He goes by the name Lil Yeti.
He wants me to go ahead with him, and you to go back for more beef jerky.
I know, right. What a show-off .
He is not as abominable as your down vest.
He came highly recommended at the local tourism desk.
He’s just going to freshen up before dinner
Well at least we know there’s somebody looking for us.
Do you have a better plan?
He's going to get his underpants.
Leave nothing but footprints.
Don't engage ... keep talking ... he's almost gone.
He's the best sherpa I could afford.
Apparently, he knows a great selfie spot.
Fake news is everywhere.
He really has had it with the whole "abominable thing".
..Well your hairy snowman remarks definitely upset him.
He invited us up for a party, but I think it will be abominable.
Clear up something for me.  Is it "Abdominal" or "Abominable"?
Your turn to go second. I am fed up with the view.
Yes, in fact he is better in bed. He’s better at climbing. He can handle the snow better. He’s better all around. So you can turn right around and leave, but I’m following him. And, I’m staying here.
I suggest you turn around.
You're exhausted? He hasn't stopped since he left Africa.
See, by staying in the here and now, you don’t miss what’s going on right under your nose.
Apparently every guy does have a size issue...
He's not a sherpa?
And we thought we needed all that climbing equipment.
Is it the lack of oxygen?
Don't you come here with that "I told you so".
He promised me it's a farm-to-table restaurant.
Really, Helen.....a Yeti?
This guy is the best sherpa ever!
Did you understand what he said?
He dumped me because I had better hair.
I told you we should have brought the go pro
You didn't want to bring your camera and now he's laughing at us.
Yah...I saw his lair but when I tried to start a fire he said it would just never work out between us.
He said he wanted to have us over for lunch.
I'm sorry to end things, Brad, but I've always dreamed of dating a yeti.
Apologize. Yeti is their word.
He's really upset you won't share your beef jerky.
Looks like what they say about big feet is true after all.
I'd never go hiking in a fur coat.
Why is it rude to ask him for a selfie?
This hike is of mythic proportions
It’s abominable of me, but I’m leaving you, Tim.
Told you we took a wrong turn.
yeti shmeti his breath stinks
Am I going to die? That was on my bucket list!
I told you we didn't need this much gear.
I had to break up with him. The relationship was becoming abominable.
I'm not sure why he wanted our hats.
Oh great. Now he's going to have a meltdown.
He said his WIFE will give us directions when she gets here. What a neanderthal!
I think he said 'Hey--you kids get off my slope!'
There’s nothing abominable about him, and touring the Himalaya with a native could be
unforgettable.
Next time I hire the guide...this guy is loathsome.
He said our price range is a few hundred feet higher.
I’m tired of Gortex. I’m thinking of giving real fur a try.
He needs some space, just learned his grandchild was human!
He said it’s just a little bit further.
Ok..so he didn’t yield to the downhill skier..yell at him.
Now who is calling who abominable!
For the last time, Kevin, WHAT sherpa?!
Did he seem abominable to you?
Not even a "hello"!  Abominable!
Just give him a minute... He has a shy bladder.
Remember; we're here to prove the Earth is flat.
I can't believe you forgot to close the garage.
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
The locals aren't all that friendly.
He was actually very pleasant.
Your right, my mom is hairier.
They should call him BigBUTT!
I wouldn't call it a thing.
Honey, we've been invited to hi-tea with the Yeti
On His Instagram He Looks Bigger ...
Actually, his feet aren't that big
The region's best waxer is located just over the next ridge.
I know it's uncomfortable having my ex around,but he really wanted to come!
Has it ever occurred to you to be just a little abominable?
The only thing abominable about this climb is your attitude!
I swear if you yell out “Look out for that Yeti!” one more time...
That was the most amazing kiss. Now we'd better do as he said and turn back.
He wants to invite us over for dinner.
Wow! Unbelievable! I'm in Park Slope, too!
He needed an update on the current generation of world leaders
Can't be, his feet are too small
He just called me "abominable" and walked on.
He doesn't look that abominable !
He said he used to be President, but wasn't appreciated for the stable genius that he was.
I told you not to say anything about the size of his toes.
He doesn't like to be called 'Frosty' either.
I'd call you abominable for getting us lost, but it'd be an insult to the guy who stopped to ask us for directions.
He was here first
That confirms it, the yeti just told me climate change doesn’t exist.
He clearly didn't receive the 'no wearing white after Labor Day' memo.
All I did was ask him what kind of shaver he uses.
Well, he isn't exactly what he appeared to be on Tinder, but hey - sometimes you just got to go with your gut.
John,   That beautiful creature just exposed himself to me
You ready?”
 “Not yeti!
Abominable Shrinkage.
It's a sign-- we should buy the cooler.
That suit looks warm. Wonder where he got it.
Oh, come on.  He says it's just a short distance to the top.
Don't be a baby...but he really does have big feet if you know what I mean.
Wow! did you have beans for lunch or what?
He smiled and winked at me--ergo, he's 'abominable?'
And yet, my mom thinks you’re the abominable one!”
Let's trust him--I'm sure he knows the way.
Don't even mention this when we get back.  They'll just say it was altitude hallucination.
Your social skills are abominable.
Y'know, gotta hand it to Tim. Sure, he might not fit in back at the pub, but out here?...
Don't worry, I told him we're lawyers.
Don't worry, no one knows the Canadian border better than this Sasquatch.
Abominable" is an adjective, not a proper name, you goof.
It’s over.
I told you not to drink that water.
I think we're heading into the Ice Age.
I know he's angry, but I am not giving him my last Clif Bar.
Follow him? He's not even wearing hiking boots!
Carl commits yet another Yeti faux pas.
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone with the dating app screen name: "Hairy"
It's been nice.
He said conditions on the summit are abominable.
Well if you didn't want to follow the Sasquatch to their lair, then why did you come along?
Well, that's the last we'll see of him.
Me Jane!
He's not seeing anybody.
Please stop calling him abominable! His name is Yeti.
The dress code up here is abominable.
False alarm, it wasn't Bigfoot. Just someone who really liked no-shave November.
Real original, like he hasn't heard a 'you know what they say about people with big feet' joke before!
He said its a 20 minute wait.
He's called "Bigfoot," not "Sasquatch," Trevor.  Don't you know anything?
He forgot his cell phone.
Did you see that?"
"Nope."
I asked for a guide who knows this terrain for a million years.
We need to tell President Pence right away! We found the runaway president!
You need to talk to your brother about hygiene, he's abominable.
He says he has a camera we can use.
But he is my type.
No, we are not there Yeti.
There was nothing abominable about him.
It’s fine Jack. King Kong was a one-time thing.
Of course he is fast! Without bags....
He says he's with the Von Trapp family.
Don't wait for me....I'm in love
I’m breaking up with you Carl and going with Big Foot.  You know what they say, big feet, big ……………...….. shoes.
He asked us to say hello to his cousin on Mount Shasta.
It’s me not you, I found a real man!
The only abominable thing about him is his attitude.
Did you let him know there’s no toilet paper in the men’s?
He’s largely unknown but keeps winning by a landslide.
I told you I stopped seeing him.
We seem to have trouble making friends.
He's going ahead for a tidy up. He says his house is abominable.
Ok, I admit it - we definitely overpacked.
When he said "no selfies",he meant no selfies!
What's with all the yellow snow around here ?
He said we are welcome....but the restaurant is closed for the winter.
Your stupid hair loss joke scared him away
I declined his request for a date and he left in a huff
One small step for man......
That’s all I heard.
Well I WAS seeing other people....sort of.
Abominable Snowman or Bigfoot? How would he know!?
He is flattered but isn't interested in becoming the podiatry college mascot.
I knew we wore too many layers.
I can’t believe he wouldn’t give us directions.
I didn't like him at first either, but the cuddling is awesome!
I’m leaving you because he’s not afraid to be real.
Should we turn around? He said we’re going the wrong way.
Sorry, Mr. Yeti doesn't like his picture taken.
So I swiped right.  You have a problem with that?
Yeah, he's hairy, but he's not a quitter.
See, we didn't need shoes or gear!
John, I'm sick of your pranks- the yeti is not real!
Catch you later, loser.
He says we should have turned left 2 snowdrifts back....
He’ll be right back. He forgot it’s his turn to bring the snacks.
Oh no, not another banished West Wing casualty…
I'm sorry, Bill.  It's the big feet
Strange. He was reciting that famous Robert Frost poem as he passed us.
He said the Starbucks will be open at 7.
"I'm sorry, but there's just something about him I find appealing."
Well, do YOU think I'm abominable, too?
pff....tourists
He said you were good for the lift ticket...
You need to tell Jeff he is taking this hipster hair-thing too far.
Was it really necessary to compare him to the abominable snowman?
Which way is progress?
He just comes down occasionally to appear on reality shows.
He decided to be upwardly mobile -- global warming isn't his thing.
My phone is out of battery. How about yours?
The locals are so rude
He is off to the spa to get waxed.
It was only a one night stand.
Male: That’s amazing!
Female: Yeah! No footprints!
It's not you, it's him, you idiot.
No, he's very pleasant. A little shy maybe but he'll get you to where you want to go.
He really needs some manscaping.
...and the guide’s an animal, Jerry.
It's abominable how he always has to be first in everything.
If Bigfoot can do it without a pole, so can I.
He wanted directions to the nearest Starbucks.
Sorry, Jeff. The yeti has WiFi, so I'll try not to make this awkward.
No, John. You're the abominable one in this relationship.
He’s mad that Bigfoot got the Animal Planet show.
this was a waste of grant money, he says he's a republican.
Sasquatch just broke my stick.  What are ya goin’ to do about it?
Rarest of breeds.  Recessive strain.  Non-Abominable.  Best guide ever
He said, if we follow him, he'll make us coffee.
He said he needed to unplug
For the last time, I said big feat as in triumph!
My Yetish are a bit rusty. I think he said "Gwargglgh".
Wow, that dude is radically ultralight--no pack, no gear, no clothes!
Yeti, yeti, yeti
The view is unbelievable!
I meant the lack of footprints, but, yeah, that's another weird problem with this virtual reality program.
He really didn’t take it well when I told him
we were engaged.
Why on earth did you say we’d play freeze tag with him?
He says that the abominable snowman is just an urban legend."
If I wanted to date a Neandatrhal I would not have gone hiking with you!
Wild man, Neanderthal, Big Foot - Nah. He's just a normal guy who has given up trying to find clothes that fit.
You know, I think he really is on the up and up.
You think it was my perfume?
Don't worry, he won't get far on foot.
Abominably cute, I'd say.
Finally, someone has decided to take the high road!
For someone who can’t even speak English, he’s a remarkable tour guide.
I told him you were only into bears.
Now you’ve done it. You know Harry’s sensitive about his large feet.
I think you have to believe before you can see.
He was sizing me up so I told him to take a hike.
Now you know what it's like when tourists try to get directions from you.
He's getting me a cooler.
Hey, there’s room on this mountain for more than one monster.
Another guide quitting on us?! You do realize a good mountain guide's harder to find than Bigfoot!
He was  3 feet taller before global warming kicked in...
well he’ll treat me better than you ever did!
Steroids.  He wins but can't compete.
He said it's harder going downhill.
You look better dressed then the last guy I met
Why shouldn't I go with him? You don't even have a mustache.
Bob, I'm leaving. He's realer than you could ever be.
Some of the people who hike this trail are abominable!
He says he won't run for president.
You go ahead, I have to send a tweet.
He said we are expecting snow tonight.
... swiped right on Tundra!
I told you he was very sensitive about his shoe size !
I'm going down. What do you think they eat up there?
It's a yeti, not a yogi.
You better apologize right away - it's not a "gorilla suit" !
You heard me; I'm leaving you!
Actually, I think the real issue here, Steven, is your casual labeling of a, noting your casual gender assumption, by the way,"snow-person", as "abominable" purely from your own euro-centric cultural viewpoint."
How could you give him your credit card?
And you said, "There's no such thing as a YILF," didn't you, Brad?
He says he's a yeti not the Abominable Snowman, he's the next mountain over.
Maybe he knows where we are...
What is it about men and asking for directions?! He may know if there is a tea house up there.
Go back?  Now who's being abominable?
Another policy adviser for the Far Right I think.
Not just bigger; better.
He's checking the border wall.
He says he's sorry but there's no vacancies up there.
bigfoot doesn't understand the fuss, he 's only a size 12
Did you really have to ask him why he was being so abominable ?
Of course he looks sad. His girlfriend called him abominable.
Don't look he's just showing off....
Exactly, who’s evolved?
Sure he smells awful, but you didn't have to say so. Now you've offended him.
He said there isn't a good seafood restaurant around here.
He says there's a cybercafe up 3 miles
Donnie says nobody loves him, everybody hates him, he's going to Russia to eat some worms.
I can’t stand our mountain guide. He’s just abominable!
Go tell him we were here first.
Have you heard any news today? That was either Yeti, or Donald Trump has been impeached.
The sherpas weren’t available...
I told you to call him Henry, NOT Harry!
Should we tell him he's going the wrong way? No, not Yeti.
He'll throw in free Wi-Fi at the Yeti Lodge.
I took the honest approach.  He's just not my type.
Just another climate science denier.
No, the view is not worth it.
He forgot his cell phone up there.
It's your turn behind"Sweet Cheeks"
I'm blind, but YET-I see.
Of course he’s real and he’s definitely all there!
He forgot his selfie-stick.
Well, now I know why he's called 'abominable.'
He said climate change is making this weather abominable.
Forget it, I’m not going to take my clothes off!
He said Shangrila was two mountains to the West.
He says we're totally overdressed for the occasion.
Remember, we are following on the footsteps of giants who came before us.
He just happens to be in front of me, I'm not following him.
We have big footprints to fill
He says we're both fired, and he'll be in his penthouse
He's having a bad hair day.

He told me to tell you he thinks your sense of direction is abominable.
I'm his new social media strategist. Can you follow us on Instagram?
I told him we have a right to be here--it's a National Park!
Bigfoot?! Yeti?! Sasquatch?! Why the racist inquisition?
I think I hurt his feelings by asking him if he was the "Abominable Snowman".
Why would you turn down a dinner invitation? Even the Hendersons are coming.
He asked if I had a cigarette!
He says there’s a snowstorm coming, he ought to know
i have a feeling he isn't taking us to the beach.
He said he's just passing through.
You’re not listening to me.
He may look like Yukon Cornelius but he smells French.
He said he found “downers” like us abominable
For the last time John, there is no Yeti!
Are we there Yeti?  Are we there Yeti?  Are we there Yeti
You are wrong!  I am sure he knows the way down.
I told him he wasn’t likable either.
Having walked behind him for 8 miles, I can now tell you exactly where he gets his name and why they chose to have it rhyme with abdominal......
Someone beat both of us to the top and he was barefoot
He said "the borscht in the lodge is not fit for man or beast."
I told him it wasn't him, it was me.
I know he'll get there; not so sure about you.
And whom are YOU calling 'abominable'?
To call him Big 'Foot' is, I think, quite a misnomer.
Let’s follow him. He seems to know this place like the back of his furry hand.
He's such an antisocial climber.
That reminds me, I left my razor at home.
You don't have to follow him to the ends of the earth just because he's your DNA ancestor.  He is everyone's DNA ancestor!

He is not just "another guy."
I don't believe it, but yet he is.
He came all this way and you only left him a $3 tip?
Sure you see Yeti.  And I just saw Santa Claus fly by with 8 tiny reindeer!
I think he said that is the way to enlightenment.
He doesn't have stock options, job prospects, or even a working knowledge of the English language, Yeti never complains. It's over, Roger.
I told you to never ask him for a selfie.
Guess that Washington job didn't work out.
His wife called him FuzzyWuzzy.
My therapist said I should get more exercise and ignore needless distractions.
Another blind date gone off the rails!
It’s a little hairy up there.
I thought you said big feet were a hindrance to mountain climbing!

He agrees, Todd. Your behavior HAS been abominable.
Well... that wasn't abominable at all!
glad you could meet me early.  that last date was a bit hairy!

I told you to ask for directions sooner, he said we should have taken a left at the last pass.
I lost him at "Netflix and...".
I can't wait till we reach the peak , the view has got to be a lot better then the one on the way up.

Just a friendly grunt "hello", nothing abominable at all.
Heh...we’re idiots. It was LEFT at the boulder, then RIGHT at the caveman remains.

He said he forgot his parka at the top.
It's just some jackass in a costume.
You told me Mr. Right didn't exist, but you were wrong.

The Yeti is going up to meditate and wants to know if we can come back later.

Next time, we go with prescription sunglasses.
Wanted to know if we could stop by Costco and pick up a Yeti.
He was disappointed that our cooler wasn't a Yeti.
See! I told you we shouldn't have shaved before coming!
Your friend really should not be climbing in this environment without the proper footwear.
Relax! I told him I wasn't interested in propogating his genes.
I knew I shouldn't shaved my legs.
What an awkward conversation. No one can know about this.
Hmm.. I don't know about "Big Foot", he looks like a size 9 to me.
I did so see a Sasquatch!
He says we don't need crampons.
I thought you said that was just a phase you went through in college?
Is it Abominable or Deplorable?  Whatever.
Apparently there's a little known Airbnb at the top. Though not much air.
Did I just see Big Foot?"

They say it's better than Gore-Tex.
Apparently he's "too big" for selfies.
Frank, I have some great news. He said he WON'T eat us AND he'll give us an exclusive interview back in his cave.
Ok. take you stick and crampons and turn around, I'm following an evolved man.
C'mon. He he said we'd be fine.
Sir, do you know what happened to the National Enquirer reporter?
See? He doesn't need a walking stick.
Should we get his autograph?
No, I told him I’m currently in a committed relationship@
He says that if we can beat him to the top, he's willing to put on a pair of  pants.
To quote the Bard, "I have thee not, and Yet I see thee still."
He complained about global warming and Trump's border wall.
We should give him a better tip with our next hike.
He said to follow his footsteps
Craig’s list has some good deals but this is a lot of work to get a discount sofa
He says he can lead us to the best mocchacino in town!
You won't believe this, but that dude said he's headed to the summit to spot UFOs.
He says a warm den with kitchen is just a few hundred feet further up!
He said if we loose sight of him to follow his tracks.
He was out of toilet paper.
He said he does not need aftershave to please his wife!
He wants syndication options too.
Apparently, sometimes less really IS more.
Yes, it's true what they way about big feet.
Just Great! It is one thing to show off your new boots. It is another to let him know that they don't come in his size."
I told you we should have brought our phones.
Maybe he's just a vegan.
Don't you think our guide has rather big feet?
I wear a size 10 shoe.  Why do you ask?
Did you have to go with the least expence guide?
If he really wanted to eat us, he would’ve done it already.
Stop calling him that. Your farts are way worse.
You are abominable. You know he's self-conscious about his feet.
He's a really good hiking guide
Maybe we could ask him for directions?
I can't walk behind him when he breaks wind.
The funny thing is, this the 4th time I’ve seen him this week. Strange.
You want me to do what?
Common Gary, you said you were prepared for this.
WOW- I just saw TWO abominable humans!
Come on, it'll put hair on your chest.
Did you have to tell him he looks like a hairy ape?
Do you think he is covered by The Endangered Species Act.
Guess what? I am leaving you.
Do you remember where we parked the car?
Yah, he’s waiting for the Amazon guy to bring his Yeti cooler.
No, Daddy, we're going to sign your stupid pre-nup.
He's real
Don't worry, Bigfoot is just a myth.
He said his name is Dale.
Did you remember to close the garage door before we left?
He said if we get enough altitude we'll see God next.
As if he's the Sasquatch from Ipanema.
He said he wants to go by Big Calves next year
Maybe he's just a "minimalist."
No, this doesn’t warrant you using a selfie stick.
Can you believe that guy climbs without water?
Shhhhh, he doesn’t like the term yeti
Now THAT’S an Instagram opportunity.
We need to do more cardio.
It's the Indomitable Snowman.
I told him women at the top are tying to break a glass ceiling and he wants to watch.
He doesn't like the name 'yeti.' He says it makes it hard getting a hotel room.
He said he's moving into more rarefied air.
You may not want to follow him, Yet-i will.
I thought you turned the oven off.
The conditions today are abominable
The altitude really got to him.
It appears they haven’t heard of manscaping in these parts.
The air is so thin up here, I am hallucinating!!
You've got big shoes to fill. Go for it !
Honey, I want to be a gatherer.
He’s going to make waffles.
It's not you, it's Sasquatch
He says it’s actually Snowberg.
He wanted to know the 7 day forecast.
John,it isn't working out.  I must follow my heart!  Besides, I have a thing for hairy backs.
I can't believe he just blew us off like that!
I've never tried speed-dating before.
No hard feelings Chad; it's just you're a little too bombinable for me.
He said if I took his picture he'd throw us off the mountain.
Honest, Tom, he reassured me that he and I still have an open marriage.
You know I don’t believe in yetis. I told him to take a hike.
He's leaving because he says unless I can assure him of all book and movie rights in writing, we'll never see him again.
well mr. smart,if we're lost,ask him.
You suggested I set the search distance on that casual dating app so low. Now, do you want to try a three-way or not?
Give me that stick Medium Foot and I'll show you what Little Foot can do!
John, I'm leaving you for Lance...
He feels like a third wheel.
Dang did you see that guys feet?
He believes a run for President might help him rebrand as “Big Hand.”
I didn't realize you asked your Father to join us hiking this weekend.
I thought us Homo Sapiens had climbed our way to the top
Just some attention seeking mammal.
He used to love it when I teased him
We're on the verge of making the biggest scientific breakthrough known to mankind, and all you care about is whether or not I've been cheating on you with Charlene?
It doesn't take much to see that the problems of two little people and one gigantopithecus don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.  Some day you'll understand that.
He looks like he knows his way around, let’s follow in his footsteps
I was disgusted, yet-I couldn’t help but stare.
He said it's only 500' to the summit. He's clearly using his own scale
Yeah, sure... but a truly great candidate for 2020 - now THAT’S rare!
That was the hotel, the room's not ready yeti
They said, "The views are something you have to see to believe."
He said if we stop calling him "abominable" he'd make us a nice frittata.
Look, i just met the guy! We're getting together for drinks later!
He does keep an abominable pace!
They're unfriendly during interval training.
Damn! Now he gets to see the other side of the mountain!
Just wanted a little peak
It was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
Actually, his feet are not really that big.
Let 's  follow him and  maybe  he will show  where we can stay overnight
He's invited us to his ski lodge.
Are you SURE you locked the front door?
He claims that my recommendation as to pants was a "trigger."
Are you the new chief of staff?
Free-styler.
I told you we’re on a de-evolution path.
He says we should have taken the South Col.
I’ve seen him a few times but I’ve learned to let him go.
It's not his big feet. It's his long legs that make him rise above myth.
I’m goin to sleep my way to the top
Why did you leave the camera at base camp?
Apparently, everyone does have a walk away price.
It's strange. He never wears a backpack.
This _definitely_ is dangerous.  And, no, it's not worth it to get more steps!
It's hard to tell from the photographs.
I told you my old boyfriend was cold.
When I asked him to take a selfie with me, he said, 'Take a hike!'.
You wouldn't like it up there. It's abominable.
He said he doesn't need a guide that  he knows the trail like the back of his BIG FOOT !
He's our sherpa.
Another free solo attempt is my guess.
For  a moment, I thought I saw you climbing the mountain without your backpack!
This is turning out to be the most abominable vacation ever!
He says your walking stick is "abominable."
We couldn't find common ground.
They are giving out Paleo snack samples at the top. Hurry before they are gone.
Did you really have to make him mad?? Now how do we get out of here!
He was offended that Siri said he was Abominable.
He said he only dates girls, no couples.
Lend him some of your clothes so we can take a picture with him.
You never pay any attention to me!” “Now, Margaret? You’re going to do this now?
This mountain guide is amazing.  And he doesn't take promotional gifts from hiking gear companies!
You think he'll take a selfie with us?
I felt the earth move!
This trip isn't a total failure, he said he'll lead us to a flower found only in high altitudes.
No,you tell him the pants store is the other way.
Sorry, no manage’ a trois
Why did you bring us on another fruitless Sasquatch search??????
I asked for the WiFi code and he said, "and you call me abominable?"
What’s so upsetting about asking for a piggyback.
On the plus side, at this elevation, most people throw up.
I told you we wouldn't need all this expensive equipment.
He says we have big feet.
Yes we are lost, the map clearly says Yeti not Bigfoot
This blind date is going so well, I'm quite breathless.
He said we are heading toward the wrong peak.
Eddie & Betty repel a Yetti.
He says the Yeti-licious Cafe at the summit is open until 2 if we intend to order.
He can actually be very funny.
With a belly like that, he must be the Abdominal Snowman.
Unbelievable!  I can access trail maps on these smart glasses!
I have NO idea where he packed it, but he said we could use 
his selfie stick at the summit when he's done using it.
None of your “cold-blooded killer” speech now...let’s just see where he takes us.
The Amazing Race: Mythical Creature Edition

"While the humans argue about the existence of God, Mr. Yeti powers toward the finish line."

You mean I bought all this outdoorsy crap for nothing?

He says most don’t make it back down alive, but something tells me it’s not from the treacherous weather conditions.
He just wanted to google map the nearest pass.
He said  damit Julie, next time YOU climb every mountain.
Well, if there was a' Big Foot' around here, I would know it!
You're SO abominable, Marco! I'LL asking him for directions.
Good news.  Jesus loves me.
How would you like to be called by your most pronounced feature? “Here comes a needle nose!”
What a jerk! Too busy to say hi?!!!
It just wants your attention. Ignore it and it will go away. "
Did you see that? He spit on me! Go punch him!
Says he’s looking for the Himalayas.
woah - did you see the size of his feet?!
No, I said we should look for an indominable snowman!
The Sasquatch returns to his lair, body shamed once again
Watch out. I think he's  gay.
Climb no farther, the weather & people are abominable!
Sorry but I couldn't resist his animal ways.
They’ll never believe us!
He said he moved here for a low monthly rent, but the parking is just horrible.
He WAS helpful. We missed the turn down below.
I said, it wasn't me!
Yeti you beti!
He offered me something you just can’t give me - a fur coat forever!
Because HE'S there?
It’s not working out. He got pretty frosty when I said his outfit was abominable.

Product placement is beyond ridiculous these days.
He said don't go up there. It's too icy.
Yet I want to keep going!
Just don't look him in the eye.

It's Gucci's chic new winter line
Holy heck, did you see that?!  That comparison about the size of a guy's foot must be true!
John! You know he's sensitive about his feet!
Another dud. Way too much camera awareness and he wouldn’t sign a non-compete. Let’s just go with The Rock in a suit.
He keeps farting!
He says for some fine dining...follow him
He's checking to see if our mesa is ready.
They say that global warming has reduced Al Gore's natural habitat to a handful of Himalayan mountains
Go confront him!  He told me I had a great butt and then gave a nasty grunt.

Are we there Yeti?

Caption by my wife, Maegan Hinton
-Scott McDavid
Apparently those Messin' with Sasquatch commercials are a trigger for him.
He didn't believe me.
Yup, genuine Yeti. 
The whole outfit's from the Yeti Boutique on Mercer Street in Soho.
Blind Woman: What did you just call me!?-
Quick, get out your Camcorder from 1996"

You know I love you Bill, but it just feels like we are going in different directions
Don't strip down. You are no match for him or the weather.
Hmmm...There's something amiss about this mountain guide.
His next press conference will be in the summer.
I already have over 200 likes on Facebook.
Let’s go back; I don’t want to be seen with him.
He claims he invented a cooler
It's not you, it's me.
You didn’t have to tease him about following a path to spiritual enlightenment.
Do not worry! I told you I do not like harry men!
Let the Wookiee win!
This new guide said he will take us to the top for a banana
You need to start taking bigger steps.
I'm going with him. Get off our mountain!

Now look what you have done.  He’s disinvited us to his chalet.
How Abominable! Yet, I cannot fathom why we keep bumping into each other like this.
You might want to turn back - the weather up there is abominable.
He's testing our new line of Winter Wear.
You’re LATE, man. Not EARLY!
He says he's Harvey's twin brother.

Here come the hipsters.
Absolutely nobody going to believe us back home... but at least that guy knows we hiked this high.

Nothing worth posting up that way.
I do not find him abominable!

Knock it off with the yellow snow jokes!
Honestly Josh, I've told you a thousand times, it's 'Plus-sized Foot

I’ll be joining my friend now in Shangri-La.
It’s been great!
Some of these climbing parties are abominable.
Okay, Ted!  I'm sorry to break it to you like this...but it IS love at first sight!
Where’s his long black overcoat and long red tie?
I told you before Todd, it's a terrible joke.
I asked if he'd like to join us, yet he just walked away.
I'm leaving you, Chad. I've found a man who can better help me achieve my goal.
I get "embracing your wild side" but that guy is taking it to a new extreme
Now I call his lawyer and get $130,000.
He says his name is Bernhard!
Not many people on this trail. Eh?
I asked him if his outerwear comes in extra small.
You'll notice your body will adapt to the thinner air that's about to start.
I figured he'd be wearing fleece.
Not impressed. His little thingy looked like a toadstool.
It can't be Sasquatch if there are no footprints, right?
Trevor, that reminds me, we have to make it back to the city by six.  I’ve got my manscaping appointment
From up here, we can see everything!
He is actually quite delightful!
Remember what Littlefinger said: Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
You said, 'not yet,"  so I say, 'it's Yeti.'"
We have to keep looking. He changed his mind about letting the president stay here after Trump blocked him on Twitter.
I knew Stanley would forget something
Why did you wait until him to ask for directions!
I bought these fun hiking glasses at REI which play motivational youtube videos to keep me climbing, but I worry I'll miss some of the scenery.
You're being evasive.
You're walking a slippery slope breaking up with me to go with him.
The view up here is absolutely unbelievable!
He said that it's just abominable up there.
I forgot my moisturizer.
We matched but had an abominable time
that solves that. Yeti happens.
I can't believe we've been where no man has been before.

That yeti said  he's moving to higher ground because of global warming.  I told him to email the White House.  Maybe trump will believe HIM.
I'm not sure. He couldn't speak any English.
I want his outfit
He says he has a mate. They're blue because of the cold.
He is in! The multi-platform launch of the “Yeti Diet” is next month. He can hit the talk show circuit in the summer but no late night and no press during hibernation.
He forgot his crampons.
Her: darling,wouldn’t it...
Him: Did you just see that that?!?
Her: See what? I’m trying to talk to you?!?!
You know what they say about Big Foot
Bro, when you reach the summit, you're only half way there.
Ever feel like you're being Sasquatched?
My friend said there was a monster here, Yeti wasn't clear about it.
Billy! I thought we were going to see the Abominable Snowman, not Bigfoot.
He wants us to respect his privacy
He's Abominable!"
You wouldn't know Big Foot if it hit you over the head.
You just HAD to go and tell him he's ugly, didn't you?
Just cause he looks like my father doesn't mean I want to be with him.
He impregnated me while you were dawdling. I have to go with him now.
He said, "Just keep going down the hill until we see the ski lodge."
Forest for the trees?  There are no trees.
I didn't see anything, did you?
No, there is a definite scent of musk, but I didn't see any footprints.
You were really abominable! He says he knows the way.
He says your GPS doesn't work here.
Just follow his footsteps- they are supposed to be quite big
Where's Dad?
He must be cold in his birthday suit!
Who are you calling a 'yenta'?
Sorry, but his nest egg is bigger than yours, literally.
Jeez, another Abominable Congressman.
No, I asked- it's not Stevie Nicks
I wonder where he got his coat.
I thought this hike was going to be hairy but not for that reason!
I'm glad I didn't wear my fur suit too... that would have been embarrassing.

Wait up Angela!
My god he was good!
Go ask him for a selfie! #Hesreal
He’s not only the owner, he is a member too.
Don't mind him. The locals really hate tourists.
He's a Tunta, not a Yeti.  Their family hasn't been speaking to the Yetis for several years now.  He asks if we could bring more frozen peas the next time we visit.
He said, "I'll see you at the top."
There is a lot of substantial foot traffic around here.
The Bigfoot in the room
He says, "Go back where you came from, 
there's no place for you here".

I swiped right for manscaping
He said he's a border wall tester.
Way retro!
Are you snow blind too?
I said HI, and didn’t look !
Ugh neighbors...
Looks like we found a new sherpa.
I know that he doesn't exist, yet I saw him.
He walks to the beat of a different drummer
It didn't work out between us.  I'm into Brazilian style.
Yes Peter, he must’ve used Mapquest.
The only thing abominable is YOU! I'm going on with HIM.
He's my mentor. I've decided to become the first female yeti.
I had just passed a couple who'd been caught off guard mid-argument by a windchill in 1998 when I realized: I don't hate people. I just feel better when they aren't around.
He has a relative that lives somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
I told you my dad is very sensitive about that photograph!
You also look abominable with those silly Foster Grants."
You should apologize, your comment about his feet hurt his feelings.
Yeh, I asked. He said it is warm, mumbled something about Amazon, and kept going.
I'll do big, and I'll do audacious, but I draw the line at Harry.
How many times did I remind you to pack the beef jerky?
Age before beauty, Jack.
Well, you heard him Mark, all must follow the strict dress code of the mountain.
He could at least get his back waxed!

He said the rest of the trail is abominable
Based on Newton’s Third Law ..... I’m waiting here!

Well, if he had ASKED, I would have told him"
Now you’re just being abominable!
We just broke up...he’s to old for me.
I told him the climb was abominable, but he didn't seem to mind.
Damn, that reminds me, did you drain the cooler?
What happens when the evolutionary chart tilts uphill?
I told him to f**k off.
He's a  nice enough guy but needs to brush his teeth more often.
And we worried about OUR outfits..."
Why settle for ordinary when I can have someone bigger and better?
When Harry left Sally
This Sherpa comes highly reeomended
Very hair-suit don’t you think?
He's Doing It, So Why Can't You?
Does that mountain inthe background remind you of toblerone too?
If you don't want to follow him, I will. I like his style.
That angry howl we heard earlier was from the abominable snowman's even more abominable snowwife.
There is a very strict dress code.
He said the nearest shelter is abominable.
He kept yelling: "I was in the pool!"
He says he lives over the hill.  After that it's all downhill.
You're always talking over me!
He’s not fooling anyone in that getup.
Don't even think of keeping up.  He just saw "Free Solo".
Apparently these new lenses filter out UV and glare but not cryptids.
I told him I didn't believe in the abominable snow man"
You’re too slow. I’m going to the summit with him.
He had me at 'Abominable.'
No, I didn't take his picture. He said he wasn't interested in followers.
(Yeti speaking into bluetooth earpiece) “Omg, Joan- you will never guess what just happened..”
It's easy, just follow is footsteps.
The nudist movement is really gaining traction
You'll have to wait until Big Foot is finished talking to the Swami

You and your sarcasm.
He was undeterred when I warned him that the weather at the top is abominable.
He said he is not abominable.
He forgot his hat

I told you not to laugh about his big, hairy feet.
He's got some pair. Uh, I mean he only wants me to follow."
He said the yetis are on winter break.
For the last time, stop calling your mother-in-law names.
He said thanks but he really wanted a pizza.
This is just what you have to deal with to have beach front property in 2030.
I'm sorry John, he just gets me. I guess deep down I always knew I was a Sasquatch.
He said something about needing to get to the pharmacy to pick up his Rogaine.
Hurry Up!!  That fat guy passed us 3 times already on the way up.
Tom, I told you that hiring Bigfoot as our sherpa was a bad idea!
Not only is not Charlie, but we're on the wrong damn mountain
He was just checking on us. Turns out he's a yeti yenta.
My old boyfriend took me to Cabo.
He didn't say much, he seemed rather frosty.
I can't figure out if he was more abominable than you are...
He came down to look for a reasonable barber shop.
What form he has, right?

Unfortunately they weren't interested in hearing about the Church of Yeti

He says he hasn't seen your missing cufflink.
1.	Nepali government should consider building a Wall!
My only New Year’s resolution is to be more present.
I hear he doesn't give autographs.
If only his resolution was to get in shape and shave.
He asked if I dated abominable creatures that don't exist.
He said it's only a half mile to the summit.
We're next, unless we leave now.
Did you have to put your big foot in it and tell him he wasn't the one on the dollar coin?
One of the first Hair Club volunteers.
It's been an uphill battle for recognition.
We're invited to a wall-painting party at 7...with the usual wooly mammoth BBQ.  Wanna go?
Did you catch the label?
He says we should itemize this year...
Now let's go back home.
Let's follow...he must know the best nearby diner
Somehow he thought 'abominable' was a compliment, poor guy.
This is why you should always carry a razor while hiking.
He said he will be ok.
Do you know what the WiFi password is?
He IS a scientist and he KNOWS that humans are causing global climate change.
I never expected to see a Brazilian wax up here.
We've been climbing this abominable hill forever. Aren't we there yeti?
No, I saw him first!
He said, "It's REALLY cold up there!"
It wasn't me this time - I swear.
What a nerve! He winked at me!
He's invited me to go with him. I'll see ya.
C'mon! Free hair care products for anyone who summits.
He has abominable manners.
Yes, but I get the dog.
Paleo diet clinic next valley over."

Marja Mills, Chicag
He said there's a nice mountain lodge about a quarter mile up this trail.
Nice to meet you Jack. I’m Jill. Wanna fetch a pale old Yeti?
As if it weren't bad enough we doubted his existence, wait till he realizes he left his rock at the bottom.
Your friend certainly was stand-offish.
Watch what you say. He turned downright antisocial when I mentioned how big his feet are.
I told him, 'OMG, the Abominable Snowman's a myth.'
oh sure, now he walks upright.
No, Larry, of course I'm not really here; you're hallucinating.  Where's your oxygen tank?  And who brought you up here?
He's gone retro.
I asked him, “Does da Crosstown Bus go by dis way ?” , and he said, “Do-dah, Do-dah!”
do you think this counts as cultural appropriation?
He said "follow me.  Mi Casa es Su Casa".
Listen -- it's more than just the cold shoulder, okay?
His climbing techniques are abominable.
If you lose your way just look down, the tracks are pretty easy to follow.
Damn, what a time to have forgotten our cell phones.
The Bigfoot erotica made me think he'd be interested.
He said to follow him to the land of expensive coolers and mugs
Don't you just hate creatures who won't say 'good morning'!
He said the way forward was Abominable!
Let’s just go to his cave for a little bit. I’m sure he doesn’t have company often and I hear he makes great snow cones.
I told you we should go au naturel!
You didn’t make reservations!
See, that guy doesn't need any high-tech climbing gear.
He says he's fleeing China.
If that's Sasquatch, there must be leafy greens up there.
He says it's just five more leaps.
While you besmirch my new man, HE has no problem buying me lady products.
They promised our Sherpa wasn't going to be Greek.
Yada, Yada, Yeti.
…and yet I love the Yeti! When you go low we'll go high!
He's self-concious about his body.
The Yeti museum is closed
If you don't ask for directions...
He’s hurt because I told him to go for a hike.
They told me that climbing Mt. Everest would be scary. I wasn’t expecting this!
He says he's going to go order some outerwear on Amazon.
I'm guessing his diet is gluten free.
He says the Khumbu Icefall is too dangerous today.
Wow, best sex I've ever had!
Is yet another Yeti a cacophony?
I don’t k know how he does it. He never gets tired. He’s a beast.
So do you come here often?
Well, aren't you the one with abominable manners?
If we just stand here and argue, destiny may just pass us by.
How could you forget your iPhone Brad.
Big feet, long toes.
You go back home, he and I are gonna spend time cleaning his cave.
I've got the name for our brand.
I'm sorry, but I'm going away with him.  Goodbye.
He says “No Humans Allowed!”
How can you think following the instructor is better than following this guy??!
Free Solo
You bet he has a trek pole!
He forgot to pack his razor.
Weird dude.
I told you I should have worn my fur coat.
No wonder nobody can find this guy.
Do you have to bring your opinions everywhere you go?!
He said to follow him 'NO MATTER WHAT!
He's embraced the barefoot hiking movement.
Jeez — His behavior is absolutely abominable.
Do I detect a bit of bits envy?
It's planet-warming/ He has to go higher to be comfortable in the cooler temperatures.
She doesn’t like man
He said there are more scenic views just over the hill
And then I said I was too young to go out with him.
See what you've done.  You are abominable.
We've walked back too far
Foot" envy, Clark
How rude! He’s sensitive about his shoe size.
So Margaret is really all in on this Januhairy thing huh?
There goes2018
I said bring the Yeti cooler!
He said he'll get the hostel open by the time we reach it.
Leave it to you to ask him where to find a good 'IPA 'and pizza around here!
Claims he’s looking for the people who stole his idea for thermos type camping gear.
Don't be so jealous, Jeffrey!  There's nothing going on between us!
Being abominable just ain't what it used to be.
Me too.
I told you we didn't need these ironic $5,000 Brooklyn Flea boots to get up there
I would suggest the restroom at base camp
I just gotta believe better directions do exist.
That is why I come here to this exquisite place of natural beauty to awaken my senses to all that is around me!
I'm done with you, Dan.
Are you going to just stand there holding your stick and prove my mother right, or are you going to grow some hair and get up that hill?
He pointed to my sunglasses and said something about climate change
I'm glad I have a good razor.
He says he lost his pedometer
He said he just needs to get away once in awhile..
He's not just the president, he's a member…
Don't ask him for a selfie!
It's not that hard, if you already live there.
You never bring up politics on a first date Jon! Everyone knows that...
The only contacts he wants is by texting.
He just passed gas, you follow him!
OF COURSE HE IS GOING FASTER THAN US LOOK HOW BIG HIS FEET ARE !
Paranthropus? What Paranthropus?
He said, “Sorry, invitation only.”
Sometimes I feel we are regressing as a race.
He said he doesn't have a wi-fi code.
Hey... was that John Goodman?
I learned from him how to climb this mountain 
without a hiking stick.
why didn't you tell me he was a vegan!
Saying Good Bye is the hardest part.
What?
He doesn't leave the seat up, He understands me and I know he did vote for Trump.
He said that Global Warming is fake.
There is nothing to see up there that you cannot see from down here.
He asked if I was available Friday night for a cocktail
We just broke up.
Uhh I like ive has enough of the brownies, Jane.
I think he said something about "forgetting ketchup".
He said if all goes well, the prototype will be available at REI in time for the holidays next year.
He said he wanted to play hide and seek, but I said no because I figured we'd never be able to find him.
Sorry for the surprise breakup honey but hairy hunk's bun is in my oven and we're late for a big foot gathering.
He wants to be the first to complete an unsupported solo climb
He forgot his SPF 30.
Snowblind? You're hallucinating!
He said he’d give Santa our regards.
I am not coming home. His sense of 
adventure is better than just watching the travel channel.
'Free Solo' motivated them to go above treeline this season.
I believe the phrase is ‘laugh it up fuzzball’. That and ‘why are there no footprints’?
Always judgmental!  I think you are abominable.
I didn’t mean to offend him but I thought he was a Millenial.
I hear that if you step in his footsteps, the avalanche won't kill you.
I thought follow the leader was your idea
See John, I told you the locals were tall around here.
I'm not so sure I still want to go to his home for dinner.
He's got to go back to camp, he forgot his cooler.
He said to follow him to his cave and we can have tea.
No help coming back, He is staying in the White House
Honey, that's not the Yeti I had on my Christmas list.
He says not to bother.
He says he's running away from this crazy world.
You say one more thing about my feet and I'm heading back.
I don't believe in anyone who hikes without proper boots or cool sunglasses.
I guess this is what he meant by “turn left at Yeti Crossing.”
Big foot?! Are you saying I have big feet?
Totally, it’s not him.
You see what is ahead of us. Let’s turn back
Did you bring any sunblock?
Any further would be abominable.
Don't worry, our Sherpa is a legend. And, with those big feet he'll clear a great trail for us to follow!
Where can I get a parka like that?
He's an abominable hiker.
He has an appointment with a podiatrist.
You're right, that wasn't Joni Mitchell.
I think his grunts indicated the path is this way
I think his name is Eddie.
He'll never make it in that outfit.
That's Donald-The World's Greatest Snowman!!!
Here’s a man you can trust to know his way
I don't think Mother would approve.
Big-Foot isn't even real- are you hallucinating again?
His feet's not that big
I thought I told you NOT to invite the boys.
He said he is late for the family dinner.
The stock offering was over two months ago!  He’s boycotting all selfies until he receives his Yeti shares.
Go figure. He wanted a sip from my Yeti.
Wow, his cardio must be really good!
Family isn't everything.
I love you and that's why I have to leave you.
Sorry, Dan. He was pretty insulted as a vegan that you keep offering him jerky. He says I have to choose—him or you. At least he can get me off this mountain.
Not impressed. Maybe 18 Wide.
Do you think he'd carry out backpacks for us?
Whatta jerk — he said dressing in layers is overrated.
This year's REI catalog is a bit too daring for my taste.
He says the only way to go is up.
It’s abominable how everyone is trying to climb Mount Everest these days.
You still believe we should go to the pinnacle?
All my worries are behind me up here!
He muttered something about needing photo ID.
Get lost--you're not my type.
He'll never make it to the top.
His outfit is abominable.
He says we'll get to see the Yetis in about an hour.
No, you tell him they’re out of towels
He's still holding out for a sponsorship deal with Yeti.
You would think for a Yeti, he would be able to point us towards the elusive Sasquatch.
What do you make of us not leaving footprints in the snow?
Hey, he invited us to his place for lunch!
He says if we follow him, he's got a whole photo studio in his man cave.
I'll deny it, so will I.
he's overrated.
Bigfoot? That's my cousin, dude
I bet he's a denier?
These clothes are weighing us down.
Let’s go ask him to be our Sherpa.
I'm wiped. This hike is abominable.
He says your perfect snow outfit makes him sick.
Harry just confirmed that your haircut is atrocious.
He asked politely if we'd leave, that he's relaxing on holiday and doesn't like to be scared while he's here.  Let's follow him!
Calling him 'abominable' hurt his feelings.
Should we ask him for a photo?
He's just a big friend.
Himalayan? No! He said I wasn't his type.
I really wanted an abominable selfie!
I guess Teddy Bare there doesn't do cuddles...
He asked which way was up.
They do Brazilians, everything.
He says to follow him, and meet Mrs Yeti
Nice guy, boring personality though...
This was an abominable idea!
Where'd you get that sherpa? Doesn't even lift a bag.
I don’t think he’s with the Backroads group
That was Donald Trump. All he said was, "See? Global warming is a myth!"
They did promise it wouldn’t be a walk in the park.
Technically he is still an illegal alien, but he voted for Trump
He doesn't know where Kylie did her Instagram shoot either.
I guess 'The Abominable Stinker' would turn off the tourists.
So how are your Exposure Therapy sessions working out?
So some people have a high abominable factor, so what?
No not a Big foot sighting. But I do believe we've discovered Big Butt.
Marry you?  Not Yeti!
Yes, I saw it! Don’t you dare say it!  Your puns make a piece of me die inside
Oh, he doesn't look too abominable!
I told him about you so he's filing for divorce.
If you follow her, I swear I'm going to my mother's mountain!
'Let's take a selfie.'
No sunglasses? Sunglasses! Amazon is amazing.
I wouldn't follow him if I were you.
I snuck a peek. It's one of those "Red Rocket" things.
"He's looking for some sunscreen and a pair of dry boots."
Hmmm.  Maybe naked is easier.
I left him because of his hideous hairpiece.
I sorry Allen, but I love Snow Joe and I’m going to folllow him to the Top Of The World...
New year, same me.
So when we defund national parks you don't need a pass?
I'm done with doing your laundry and ironing your shirts. Goodbye.
This guide, you hired. Does she know where she is going?
I told him that we could still be friends but he wasn't buying it.
He said  that if we want to climb this mountain, we need to call ahead  for reservations.
I wish I had dressed as warmly as he did.
It's quits for real!  His behavior was abominable, too!
You follow him if you think foot size is a measure of spatial awareness.
I told you Robin Williams was still alive in the Alps.
Time passes very slowly up at the top.
It's over between us Todd, go back down.  His tantric technique is the stuff of my deepest fantasies, I can't even blink.
When global warming began, he rented out the house next to us near the Everest summit.
Let him take the lead, even if he may be an abominable know it all man.
Don't meet your heroes - his foot size is average at best.
Don't make eye contact.
...I bet he plays for the Celtics!
Hiking helps him to slim down and become 'The Abdominal Snowman'.
He'll be back in a minute; he forgot to post on Instagram.
That’s not fair; he has longer legs than we do.
I think he heard you talking smack about his prefrontal lobe. We'll never catch him now.
Trust me, it's like the new Brooklyn.
Yes, I know, I told him yesterday he needs some sunglasses.
I think he's still in the process of becoming human.
How can he not wear sunglasses?
You know, you should have a leash on your pet.
All I said was your breaths abominable!
He’s leaving without even taking a selfie with us – he is truly abominable!
'Says his name’s Gorp and, frankly, he sounds a little paranoid.'
Would you quit ordering me around?
He said there's an opening in Interior.
Should we invite him back to the lodge for some eggnog?
He says that we're not at the top yeti.
I walked right by them. There were two, they didn't even see me.
He says he doesn’t know the way down.
I don't know what it was, but it has a big Google footprint.
He asked me " Do You Know the Way to San Jose?'
I've heard he makes killer snow cones
He was hoping that we were carrying insulated mugs.
He says climate change is getting pretty abominable!
Ugh, are we there yeti?
Don't look! Bird Box!
I didn't know Uncle Harry was making the hike.
You said the hotel was ten minutes from the city centre!
He was the proverbial 98-pound weakling before he took up climbing.
No pictures, worst comb-over ever.
Whaddaya mean I've got big feet!?
Trust me; his feet aren't what's relevant to me for bigness.
His back-hair makes him more manly than you.
He said the hard part of the trip is over and we should follow him for the quickest way to the top.
I told you he wasn’t interested in Little Foot.
Well, that proves it. They do smell sickly-sweet.
He is a fast climber, yet he has no hiking boots. Nor any clothes ---abominable!
I want a fur coat in the same material he is wearing.
Sorry, John. It is over between us. Do I love that hairy brute? Yes. Yet I ... know not why!
Yeh. Same exchange whenever we part: I say, 'See you later,' and he replies, 'Better to see than be seen.' Really nice guy, though. Not as he is portrayed in the Fake News.
What do you mean? “Shit rolls downhill?”
I found him to be very anti-social.
Sorry. I know he goes both ways, but he's MINE!
You may follow the Neanderthal. I'm returning to civilization.
Let's go back. The top looks kind of scary from here.
No, you're abominable with that needle stick and those little feet!
He saw his reflection in the snow-covered hill. Guess that means it’s safe to climb!
Yeti or bigfoot?
Apparently, his name is WARP...and he can write.
You know he’s sensitive, Mario... yeti there you go again putting your big foot in it by saying he looks like Donald Trump.
Perhaps we wait until he makes it to the summit!
Trump couldn't get his southern border wall so he opted for Bigfoot on the northern border instead.
He wants to know: Who won the 2016 election?!
He's looking for a place that serves hot chocolate.
He says you're the one that forgot the crampons.
Are you going to let him get away with _that_?
I thought that your question was abominable, yet I can understand why you asked him.
He said given our size he suggests the ridge to the right for the summit.
He is not a public figure!  Leave him alone!
Don’t look now but Bigfoot is behind you.
So...Can you see yourself wearing it tomorrow?
I didn't know your brother was coming along?
I offered, but he said I wasn't his type.
He is an alternate real.
He told me he doesn't wear boots because his feet are too big.
These sunglasses aren't polarized, Bill!
I thought you said you couldn’t secure a guide
He only has 3 minutes to catch his Uber rendezvous.
He may be a snowman, but in another 1,000 feer, he'll need oxygen like everyone else.
You kept doubting him Yeti did get us up here
You should have offered him a bigger tip!!
That's what happens when your tent comes with free wi-fi and Netflix.
It’s not really an ascent.
Abominable!?  He seems quite pleasant and he's a Sherpa to boot.
he's a good roommate but i wish he'd buy his own shampoo and conditioner
I swear, it was just an abomidable cup of coffee.
Take care of yourself, Bud. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with the Snowman.
I'm tired of having this conversation over and over again. If you want to run for acting attorney general, then run.
I'm leaving you for a real woman.
Stand aside, I'm Don Jr. and my daddy said I could kill that Yeti!"
Really!? That's a new low for you Jack.
Did you See that guy!? He was wearing a figleaf!
Now you've done it again. I told you not to question his sense of style.
Did you remember to pack a razor?
He left his phone by the register.
Yes, since they translated "Into Thin Air" into Yeti, absolutley everyone is trying it.
Back and forth he goes, demolishing walls to let his family in!
He said he needed to go home -- he was feeling abominably.
OMG! GMOs are more hazardous than we thought!
No wonder we’re lost! He said we should have taken the left at the last trail marker.
I'm attracted to him.
He says we are trespassing on his property!
That rug front of the fire?
Uh - Are you kidding me, Greg? Whatever-that-was just pushed  me over! I told you to stop him, yeti's walking away...
Fool me once....!
Don't look at me that way!  He got fresh with me!
He said the hot springs are just a little further.
Wow! What a warm fuzzy!
Apparently snow blindness is just another figment of the imagination?
He's just a guy in a furry suit.
Good news, darling, I've got custody of the kids !
To me, the lede is its formation of a 2020 presidential exploratory committee.
He coudn't talk. Something about how Jack Frost hates it when he's late.
I will follow him because there ain't no mountain high enough to keep me from getting to him.
He says we should turn back; this is HIS mountain!
Said he left his car keys in his other suit.
Selfie stick, are you kidding?
Homefield advantage
He forgot his muffler.
The nerve of that guy! He grabbed my phone when I tried to take a picture of him! Abominable doesn't even come close!
He says if we strip down to our skivvies we can follow in his footsteps.
He said he was sorry but that “He won’t take no group selfie without a selfie stick”.
"Oh, he's just checking out the hairy spots."
Impressive feat.
Nah, not the Abominable one, just an exhausted St. Nick.
Eat your heart out!
George said if he's going to pull this off, he'll need more money.
Should we warn him about how the world has turned out to be?
You might want to try the women's bathroom.
Have you seen my father? He left his shaving cream at home.
Follow him he's evolving to a higher place.
You never know who you're going to meet up here.
He forgot his backpack!
Lunch? Not Yeti.
He's heading north for the winter.
You’re asking me to put my life in the hands of a man who has not fully evolved.
He gave me his autograph but wouldn't do a selfie with me
He's going back to get me the recipe for mountain oysters
Is that your dad?
Must be one of those "hipsters"  the folklore talks about
Personally, I think he doesn't have enough layers to go up there.
I 'm coming from the electrolysis.
Withi this guy for a neighbor, it  practically guarantees you wife will never call you a Neanderthal!
Let's follow him
Don't look behind you, but I think I see the Yeti.
You're calling me self involved?... Really, Gavin?
I told him it's over.  Let's go back to our little home, dear.
This is a perfect spot for selfies!
He was saying that Everest was right here
But I told your family that we were going to Miami.
We can keep going - I told him we forgot our cell phone chargers too.
I told you to bring your good camera! You never listen to me. Remember when we went to my aunts house and I told you not to turn the light off in the staircase and when..... came to...... and  you thought ... even though I told you to you it woul....
Coffee is okay, yet tea is my favorite
He just said if I want to see him naked I should Google his site.
He got mad when I told him he needed a shave.
Who cares - as long as he can take an instaworthy picture for us
Hikers with smaller peckers must wait here.
So he said, “Just follow me,” but I’m a little nervous he’ll disappear and we’ll never see him again.
Who knew that gaining perspective would actually increase my solipsism?
Yeti Schmeti. This vacation is abominable.
He is searching for global warming.
Honey did you consider that he might get hungry and eat us after we smoke that blunt?
He claims he gets a 20 second head start.
Well, I guess he didn't see me.
The hairspray was a deal breaker.
GPS is down, can't find trail, OMG what do we do?
What do you mean I have big feet?!
Hiking in Colorado has really changed since Trump made it his summer getaway White House.
Goodbye, John.......I'm going with him.
Sorry to say, but your mother is really hairy.
We forgot to bring our ugly sweaters.
OK, sure but, can it tie a butterfly knot?"
Load the gun.
No squatch here man.
Oh, you think anyone who's not into cryptozoology is an academic butt-kisser.
Sure its a hike for laser hair removal, but Mom swears by it!
He's as real as your self-confidence.
Oh he just needed to borrow a trowel.
I saw Jill head up a little earlier.
It's a living!
YET-I should have known, "Love 'em and leave 'em.
I think it's time to tell him he's lost control of that holiday beard.
This is not what I meant by off-piste.
I think he's mad at us
Haven't you heard of "pix or it didn't happen"?
Okay, so he's already reached the peak in his career--but if you want to lead instead, you've got big shoes to fill!
He said it's a few miles to the top.  He also said to holler if we needed help getting back down.
Big Foot or Extra  Large ?
I do NOT have big feet!
Try not to panic but I think there's a body buried over there"
He feels strongly that he should get royalties for the damn cup.
You are the most abominable man I've ever seen!
He's angry because the weather today is sunny and not abominable.
Did you see that? So abominable, he just invaded my space. 
Aren't  you going to say something!
I guess time really does feel different on vacation.
I feel capable of summiting, YET I have a foreboding sense of some fantastic beast beating us to the top.
‘More like the Abdominable Snowman’? Really? You know he’s self-conscious about his weight.
Where’s a can of red paint when you need one?
Where is my camera?
What size did you say you were?
I told you, we shouldn't have shaved this morning.
Let’s give it five minutes then pretend we’re two different people.
I told you we needed a thicker coat!
What in The Wide, Wide World of Julie Andrews brings you here today?
I meant bring the 'cooler' Frank.
I think it's time to descend: I just saw a guy in a funny white bearskin costume, and it's way past Halloween.
We both are nuts. You follow the Yeti. Yet, I follow you!
He says he's not some plaything and that if we're serious about fooling around, we have to sign a contract and enter his polycule.
Well, he wasn't very abominal at all.
I've been telling you:  It's an Obama Nation.
See? The camera does add 10 pounds."
Zgjim Terziqi, Kosovo
Perhaps I should have called him just 'Denominable' instead.
I think I know why they call him Sasquatch!!
It is after 5pm, he will be abominable again tomorrow.
They don't make snowshoes in his size.
When you’ve seen one yeti, you’ve seen ‘em all.
HIS FEET ARE REALLY NOT THAT BIG
He wants us to follow him.
He's hurt, says he's acrually quite bominable.
Davos parties are known for being funky.
I just remembered, we forgot our cooler.
Its impossible getting a close shave up here.
I'm sorry Dave, I'm going with him. 
I'm not attracted to you anymore and I find him irresistible.
I just became a highly paid scout for the N.F.L.
That was an abominable thing to say, dear!
What? You said you wanted a Yeti for Christmas.
I’m going with him. I’ve always wanted a fur.
If he can make it to the top, I think we can too."
My husband has a right to exercise like everyone else!
Are you my ride down?
I thought fur was a faux pas again but it’s suiting him quite well
Because it was there.  How about you?
No, we're not going to push him off and see if he bounces.
I think his four star Yelp rating is over generous, frankly.
He's naked.  He's not even wearing sunglasses!
Do you think he might know where the closest loo is?
Do you not understand the word ‘abominable’ ?
His fingers are really big.
He's going to check on table availability at the Trump Hof 2000 meters further up
After his recovery from cocaine addiction, Leo really hates being called Abominable Snowman.
If we follow him, do you think he'll take us home with him? Won't everyone be jealous?
I explicitly said not to tell him about Twitter!
It's just a cooler, Frank. I want the real thing.
Like I TOLD you... Just 'cause it rhymes, he still wouldn't appreciate spaghetti!
He thinks he saw the Singing Nun.
I don't know where he's going, but the last guy who followed him was never seen again!
What an abominable time to get snow blindness.
It really is never too late to put in your 10,000 hours to evolve.
After fifty years of climbing,Bob just doesn't like working as part of a team.
You went with 'abominable?'
Celebrity or not!!!!!
We are not following “Mr. Bigfoot” to the ends of the earth.
I knew we got the wrong style snowsuit for this mountain.
My trekking partner was abominable!
I can see it's not occupied. I'm gonna give it a couple minutes.
No, I do not think this is proof of the Stoned Ape theory.
Behold- the furry butt strut.
Your behavior is abominable.  Take a hike!
Trump's in the orange coat.
He doesn't need a walking stick.
I think things are better where he's going.
It's not you, it's Meh-Teh.
His day rate is triple union scale, and he doesn't do his own stunts.
Have you spotted him yet?
Why is he running away from us?"
"I told him earth is flat"
He’s not going our way.
Nice enough guy, but I think he "OD"ed on the supplemental testosterone.
She's tried yoga and meditation too.
Twenty-five steaks and he makes me pay the bill--That’s the last date I have with that abomination!
Yeti schneit, when I am getting a ring?
It's the only place where he can get shoes in his size.
Yes, I’m going with him, believe it or not we’ve been seeing each other “on and off” for many years now.
He’s going to take us to his leader.
I told you so--Airbnb's can be abominable.
Let's ask HIM who did the best acting in that "Twilight Zone" episode; Shatner or Lithgow
They say he slept next to a woman for thirty years but never had sex with her. It drove him to politics.
My turn. We already have Ascent of Man.
He said the furry convention is already full
I really know how to say no!
It’s your job, whether or not you get paid for hauling his shit.
Seriously, you need to do something about that B.O. problem.
These mythic legend lenses are great at fending off glare.

I can tell you this: he certainly knows his "ups and downs" in more ways than one.
Frank just doesn’t understand my puns. “Yeti” will in the future.

Another small step for mankind.
And Yet-I told he exists and you doubted as usual.

Now, about the beef jerky. I'm not going to say I told you so, but...
That strange guy just sexually harassed me and he's not wearing clothes.
He didn't seem interested in my recommended haberdasher.
He seems a bit backward to me.

I've got a blister
That’s some serious abominable snow, man.
He said he is going in search of full body shadows.
What mountain?
You can only come here if you’re truly not on social media. Very few people believe we exist.
He forgot his slippers!
Believe in yourself.
What do you mean you can't see him?
Are you snow blind?"
Sheila Ryan, Houston, T
I told him one role in the snow isn't a relationship.'  His 'foot' size may be astounding but it's not enough.
What? I told him it’s still 45.
Dorris, I am not in the mood to argue right now.
I don't care if you don't believe in me, I believe in myself!

The lofty spirit resides in all.
Too abominably warm down here for him.
You’re an outdoor adventurer.  How do we exploit this on Gofundme?
Didn't he read the dress rules posted at the entrance? If I'd known they were so lax here , I would have worn my new Manolo Blahniks.
People really don’t pick up hitchhikers anymore.
Do you think he might tell us the way.?
He said it was a few hundred feet!
It's the Abominable trail but his preferred Surname is Yeti

We have a better chance of finding a yeti than Muller has finding anything incriminating on Trump.
I turned him down for a date, yet he persisted in asking for one.  Get it?
He said he needs to take a potty break.
We really should've all worn the warm overalls, Jacob.
You seem nice...Yeti just broke things off  and will need some time before jumping into a new relationship.
He didn't have to buy overpriced hiking boots.
Forget those television adds you see about the aggressive Bigfoot creatures in the lowlands. These highland Yetis are downright sensitive. This one mumbled something to the effect that it needed to get away and clear its head after our exchange.
He says the Potato Curry Cafe is straight ahead.
I'm sorry, Glen, but Riggleman was right about the erotica.
I just broke up with him. He is too much of a momma’s boy for me.
Ask him over there for  directions

Don't believe the tabloids, I'm sure that Sasquatch's don't eat people.

Yeah, saw him on the airtrain. Self-styled Master of Disguise.
He says they're having a party.
I've tried online dating and prefer our chances on the mountaintop.
No! As I told you, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT BIG STUPID YETI !!!
sheesh... foot traffic up here is even bigger than the city.
I told you our packs were too heavy
He said keep trekking and we'll make it to the top!
Uh, You're not going to believe this, but, , , , ,
I told him that provocative clothes were better than no clothes at all.
Sorry, but I really want to do something a bit more hairy.
I'm not a big fan for the latest winter fashion trends.
The plan was that I would summit first!
I want to live the hairy life
Did you see that Yeti?
You Yetti get moving.............
Your so abominable.
He wanted to know where the nearest Top Cuts was?
I cannot believe my species evolved into something like that. Oy veh!
I came here for exotic viewing- not exotic mooning!"
Adam Moakher, Oakland C
Of course I didn't see him. I believe in UFO's.
Think he knows any Fornite dances?
Why can't you be so thoughtful?
When you said you’d take me to the heights, I didnt’ think this is what you meant!!!
Nice going with the "Bumble" references, Yukon.
Where did you say you saw the bigfoot?
I counted eight passes of the basketball.  How about you?
So I have to tell you again--you are so rude!

He asked if we were interested in a manage.
Legend vs Barista? It's a living.
He must be so cold.
He said ‘brb gotta pop a squat’.
And yet 'e still couldn't tell me why that's what they call 'im.
You still staring at my Zit? You rude jerk!
And with these ‘Ultra-Shade 5000’  lenses, it’s like there’s no snow at all!
Beware – there’s a bunch of rowdy Boy Scouts on top.
About time he loped in-focus.
He said he's exhausted, yet he continues to climb.
Yeti tink I taw it!
He said, Please don't call me "Abomnible"
Another giant leap for mankind is right there if only the two of you can not be so oblivious.
He's going to go eat all the people who died in the plane crash. Yum yum yummy!
Do you think we should just wait for him to come to us?
I told you something about this "Guide"
Fred, do you see that large hairy creature? What, I didn't know your ex-boyfriend was here
I'll be joining Warren's exploratory committee and you're waiting for Biden to declare so I guess it's goodbye
He left his heart in San Francisco...
Didn't I tell you these hiking shoes were a total waste of money?
Turn around and follow our cross fit instructor.
Want me to ask for an autograph or you?
Yes, abominable, Yethe is the dearest of hiking companions.
Yeti, there was another man before you.
It’ll be a million years before someone makes it up this far
He asked if he should expect a coffee shop to follow.
Got change for a $50?

You shouldn't have asked him if he went an Ivy League School!
I said, "Have you heard of #MeToo?", and he turned on his heels.
They'll never believe it without a Video!
One of those Shackleton Guys
The abominable snowman just passed me on his way up this mountain.
Yes, his name is Eddie Moretti. Yes, he likes spaghetti. But he is clearly a SASQUATCH.
We should follow him because he’s  allyeti been to the top
Totally...just let me go grab some pants.
I just realized I forgot my YETI at home.
Yeah, seeing the guru was totally worth it. I'm not going to let life pass me by.
You just gotta believe in yourself.
He said it's his favorite short-cut, hills no problem and he absolutely loves the scenery
Holy shit it's the fucking yeti! Quick, take a picture!"
"Suck my balls Sharon you dumb bitch
Apparently he's sick of everyone Messin' with Sasquatch.
I'm going to get my back blown out by a Yeti that's where I'm going!
For Him.
Being a Harvey Weinstein paparazzi is getting more difficult.
He asked if we'd seen Jill . . . yeti.
I forget my camera.  I think I'll have to head down.
Are we supposed to be blind, or is it just bright?
Maybe if we follow in his big foot prints we can keep-up.
I think he's on the wrong mountain.
He's pissed. He still hasn't received his comped Rambler Tumbler.
maybe the Donald will get us there
Don't be scared, he's the New Yorker's newest Caption Contest judge, on a break.
It's my big brother headed to Harvard.
I'm catching me some Sasquatch dick. Don't wait up.
He said don't go on Wolverton Mountain.
So I heard that there was a really hairy man pretending he is big foot, around here .
We probably should have thrown red paint on his fur.
I already don't want to carry my own crap - now I have to carry his too?
The only difference between any two entities in the various worlds is a matter of orthogonal rotation.
And you just missed the abominable snowman.
He said what I am wearing is way out of style--what an abominable comment!
He says it is easier to summit by way of the southern route.
His family has been climbing this mountain for centuries. You' d think they's be bored by now.
Yeti-r you go again, on with the yeti jokes.
Yeah, you have just spotted a real trail legend; thru-hikes this peak barely leaving a footprint
He said his name is Abominable.
I hear a Yeti's inner temperature always stays the same
He said  “I am i in Yeti”
It's bald.
His positive attitude will help him seek great heights.
He said that he's going on ahead to ward off all the troubles and worries of our endangered generation.
The view is breathtaking, but cell coverage stinks.
He told me “No, my cousin is not Yeti”
Look, I know we just met him, but I do think it's best if I go up with him alone because of his fear of numbers."
I said “Do Not follow the Yeti”!!
I think Santa needs to shave”
Oh ya, the ranger did say they were bringing in path clearing equipment.
I didn't want a photo he isn't verified on twitter.
It's abominable to be so naked!
Whatever you do, don't make any sudden bowel movements.
Speaking of which, my new boss is an abominable.
I checked.  There weren't any listings for "excellent" snowmen.
I can't even with you guys right now...
Wow. I can't believe that the legendary monster known as the Yeti or Abominable Snowman is standing right behind me. This just goes to show that anything can happen when you climb mountains.
Go away. Leave me alone. I want to explore this mountain in my own.
He said, "Stick with me, and I'll make you the smartest kid on this mountain!"
Honey, I told you we shouldn't have left without a compass; how
just how far have we walked?"
Is it me... or did steve forget to shave again?
Yes that really was him!  I thought for a while that we were an item but he said he just couldn't stand my tiny feet.
There is something so beautiful about nature...in all of its forms.
I was young and innocent,but now I have found my dream,Captain Von T.
Hurry, or 
she will leave us!
Had me fooled,thought for sure he'd want our peanut butter.
Are you still sold on all our gear
He aid there is nothing up there but angst.
I told you not to bring your brother along—his personality is too big.
He said his is 'Yada-Yada-Yada.'  But, I could be wrong.
What in the world did he eat? Breathing at these elevations is never THIS hard.
My estate is not ready for probate.
Maybe these ones will finally notice me...
Nice going. We’re stranded halfway up without a guide all because you just couldn’t stop singing “Zendaya is Meechee.”
Remember,I told you to buy that suit last week?"
He's looking for his mislaid longjohns.
You’ll never guess where they got the name!
You offended him with your ape jealousy
Starbucks is down the mountain, not up.
Hello, I'm following a big giant. I want to see what he's up to.
I told you my feet were too small for this climb.
Some of our old travel companions got a little too invested.
You know that's not the direction to the up-town R train.
No matter how high that Yeti climbs, his inside temperature is always the same.
He said he's slouching. Where's Bethlehem?
He didn't like the Smallfoot movie so he won't take us to his village.
Yet he doesn't ever rest!
He/She may be abominable but, is great if you need a hand or something warm to hold onto.
He groped me !
Wow, those sure look like big footsteps to follow in."
"I know -- and he's not even wearing socks!"
I tried but I can’t keep up with him.
Woman, everything is an uphill battle with you. Just put one foot before the other.
I hope he uses toilet paper
I don't care what kind of trail etiquette your ex has.
Geez, I feel so under dressed!
He said, "Send a paparazzi dog and I'll talk."
Didnt you forget something...like  our skis.



Elizabeth Shaw, San Francisco. CA.
Nobody told him November ended two months ago.
Yeti pubes, dude. Now we know
You smelling that? He’s leaving a downwind gas trail of garlic pepper beef jerkey!
I guess they didn’t wear hats back then.
The Yeti is despondent as the LBGQ said it can not be a member.
He says someone put steroids on his only razor
He's says he gets clothes right now, or he walks for good.
It's Sasquash's summit home
This is a great spot for our new headquarters
Because, Brett, those are incredibly offensive names.  And the Journey song is tired.
Just don't offer him oatmeal.
The weather up there is abominable!
Did you have to tell him that we'd meet him up there later? I have no more big foot cookies.
These shades are really dark.
The Schoen-Rene Caption on the boxing-gloved pianist was  better!
#MeTwoDegrees
His name is Yentl Yeti but he won't take a selfie with me!
Honey look, our cooler can walk!
I dunno. He just fast-talked something like “Hillary, stop following me”, “hell freezes over”, and the “fastest most beautiful path to Kremlin anyone on earth has ever seen”.    PG
So... that part about the rest of our days together... we're still good, yeah?
Really, he’s not so, just abominable P.R.
I expected Naples to be warmer.
Is this slope for ski-dating or Tindering?
Well, Jacques-o, what's next for you?

Jacques LaFleur: I don't know. There's always Loch Ness.

[Both laugh]
"He said he likes to come up her for his privacy"
Odd, he asked me to call him a Yeber.
Just the beauty of Father Nature...
Each time he goes up, he complains about a missing rock.
Let's ask if he knows the way to the abominable snowman.
Yukon Yeti Yogi Yahoo
You gotta come through me to get through him!!
The sooner we get to the top the sooner we turn back into fish!
Can you believe the New Yorker tried to scam me for $120 bucks after the trial p eriod, what a pack of cocksuckers...duck The New Yorker..BITCH
Your hiking skills are an obination !
I wonder why they call him the Abdominal Snowman?
He said there's a Starbucks about a mile back. He knew a shortcut and they'll never see us coming.
Do you think he got his outfit at Sports Authority?
The mountain would not come to Monster Erotica.
He said he’s just getting back from his holiday vacation on the island of misfit toys.
He says if we don’t leave his land, he’s will kick our asses !
What a waste. His feet isn’t really all that big.
Not interested, but he said the White House might try Bigfoot.
You get the spray tan, I’ll get the rope.
For avalanche sake!  He should be packing a transmitter, snow shovel and probe.  He can’t expect 911 out here.
I think your fruitless pursuit is an abomination.
Cool, I wasn’t aware that A.I. had created a new climbing solution.
Really? That's the view? Both Matt Whitaker and Denver Riggleman recommended this hike . . .
The Hair Unapparent
I'm thinking of trading my Canada Goose Down for a Yeti Fur.
He made a pass at me !
I just met Bigfoot and he thanked me for looking in on his wife.
He lives around here somewhere around here.
Damn that guy needs something...maybe a haircut...I don't know...
These new sunglasses block 100% AS rays.
No point to get civilised - these guys can't even agree on continuing resolution
I didn't mean to offend. Everyone likes snowball sandwiches!
I have a hard time keeping up... my feet aren’t as big.
Bigfoot is wearing the latest in thermal wear.
He thinks he'll win, but he doesn't have the right clothing.
You'll never get up there without the right gear.
He's an agent and he wants to make us rich and famous.
Man says,
"You think you're sharp, just because your head comes to a point"
You're so insecure, no one can stand to be around you.
There's nothing funny here, so please step back.
I told you we were close to the hot springs!
You look dazed and confused.
Take a picture, it'll last longer creep! - I have a boyfriend.
I feel like in a movie... don’t you?
Any snow up there?
I knew all those hiking lessons were a crock of shit
I told you his brain isn't big enough to know that passing in the right lane is illegal.
He just said,’Please get out of my way and go on back down.’
He said the nudist colony is an EEO.
If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.
Do you have the Age?
Let’s catch up. I’ve always to stand on the shoulders of a giant.
This is abominable. What took you so long?
He must be really piss off
OK, its true...I’m going with him because your #metoo backpack
I’m thinking if we follow him we may never be seen again!!
All right, have it your way—you heard a yeti lament!
Is that you walking away from me?
That's the hairy guy I've been lookin' for, I'm going after him!
Are you Yeti to continue or not?
No dice. They just showed me their copy of an Injunction Against Harassment.
He said that he's looking for a shoe store that carries extra wide sizes.
You’re acting abominably.
You might say I saved the last dance for you.
He loves a good freeze dried chicken tetrazzini that feeds EIGHT.
You have angered my father, Gornak, son of Tetow. He will never support out union now!
He said Survivor need to talk to his agent.
No, he's the "abdominble" snowman!
H'm I thought I heard something. Oh well, it must be the wind... or a fat gorilla yelling
He’s not sociable,yet,I think I heard him grunt.
I accidentally called him Abdominable Snowman and he's sensitive about his weight.
He's got great snow shoes"
Why'd you have to Bigfoot our decision to peacefully hike to the summit?
Keep looking I'm sure we can pick its' traks up again.
Have you seen any Yeti?
No, not yet.
OH MY GOSH! JANET! BEHIND YOU! DO YOU SEE THAT?



It's a woman.
I tell you -  I'm seeing things"
I think our guide's lunch might have been braised rabbit in garlic sauce.
It's an experiment to determine if he can replace snow groooming equipment.
Give me that stick; I am going to follow him.
I'd heard that antique fur is all the rage on the slopes!
You think you’re smarter than everybody else! You don’t even know which way is up!” [Underscore the word "up"
I would rather marry big foot than you!
He says distant planetoid Ultima Thule is snowman.
I told you it was a great idea to recreate the movie BirdBox with these shades on
He said “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.” It’s time for you to turn back, John.
He forgot his pajamas.
Oh it  is just another ordinary mountain to climb.
The surprise is better when he starts it higher up!
Please stay. I beg you not to cro!
Argue, argue, argue!
It looks like we should ditch the jackets and get fur coats instead.
Cranston Now youttps://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/contest#thisweek
We go now, we catch the draft.
He's in a hurry to get to the sock hop dance...
1st place is a thick wool pair...
I think it’s that Ultralight Fur Yeti-Ready model?
He  says we are approaching the Upland  border where clothes   are  not allowed. and everyone  fury.
I know he can't help it with the altitude and all, but I'm eve-level with his ass and I'm going to get pink eye before we summit.
He said," Look at this mountain; it's fabulous.  The guy who put this together did a wonderful job."
Cuddling, that's where it is!
Do you think he needs crampons
I've heard time travel happens in high altitude.
It's an old world up there!
That guy thinks he’s so much cooler than us because his feet are bigger than oura
Let's keep our eyes wide open for any hint of HIS presence!
Well, if you weren't so stubborn.
you should have given him your call card
Do you think we should go back to that look?
It's the abominable impeached-man on the way to his final summit with Kim Jong-um.
I’m trying to climb -with a primate
What do you mean, “we can’t follow him, he’s not wearing sunglasses”..?
Says he' can't miss showdown with 'biggest, best,' etc."
I wonder where he got those sturdy boots from.
I'm leaving you, Chad. I'm only into Bigfoot cock now.
Where's a camera when you need one?    Small foot exists!
fuck shi t fuckfuck shit .. fuck
Hmmph--peakbagger.
The Abominable Snowman is a myth, like having to wear a jacket when you climb a mountain.
I think I saw that Yeti somewhere around here.
I told you we didn't need backpacks.
He promised he'd write every day!
Places!
it's fur coat seson
He didn't know you have to be thirteen to enter and vote.
It’s amazing what evolution can do when you can’t get to the summit for 20yrs
I did not have sex with him!
Now is the time to try your new battery razor.
My jeans got spliced.
Sorry.  He's turn down his visit with Bigfoot.
I've just been YETTI-IZED!
I don't care if the haute route is on your bucket list I'm going to the maibeau spa to warm up.
Qianlong Ping
There goes the neighborhood. They let up here these days ...
A Big Foot!! I want to get a selfe!!!
It's Bubba's neanderthal brain that bothers me.
Hey, let's follow his trail to the top!
He's on a mission
He said even though he has a Bigfoot he jogs like this every morning
No.  He was just merely awful.

Jeff Tillotson

jtillotson100@gmail.com
I told you we didn't need four different kinds of Swiss army knives!
It's over George. The Hairy Behemoth looks pretty good now!
Of course we'd find a Yeti in a trackless waste.
I think he lost his Knapsack
"Pessimist"!  "Optimist"
It's about The Quatch on the mountain
Sometimes, my imagination is lazy and only walks wild.
Really ? You asked him why he wasn
Going up,that guy does not leaven tracks
Shitcock.
I thought we were on a date far from the maddening crowd!
Didn’t we meet in Istanbul?
Look! What`s down there?
That jerk ever hear of trail etiquette...didn
Hillary Clinton made deals with yetis to rig the election!
Was that a yeti or hairy man.
Patrick McGuire Waldorf MD
Maybe you should tell him there's nothing up!
Oats not what he said, it’s how he said it
DOH, how would he know about copyright infringement?
Stanislaw Szudkalaki told me you would be here
He’s not down with pegging, which I totally respect, but you know I need to dominate our plus ones like that in a threesome context or I can’t climax.
Are you the one who just tweeted that he was abominable?  Come with me for your public shaming.  You can't escape the twitter-police.
Watch it!   It's the Abdominal Snowman  a.k.a. Abominable Snowman or Yeti.
He : You could’ve frozen to death - you left camp without your parka ?
She : Why, that strong Yetti carried me in his arms & kept me cuddled warm.... he was more of a gentleman than you are, my dear !
Just because you're tired is snow reason to act abominably!
What a surprise seeing you here!  I keep seeing some of strangest things on this adventure, and I'm becoming convinced that just about everyone passes through this place.
He was “snow bathing.” His clothes are on the summit.
Bryan Mattimore

Bmattimore@growth-Engine.com
where's that can of paint you brought
Sunglasses.
I just told him it wasn't there, but....
I told you not to forget the car keys
We’re not there yet, but the Yetty is!
Yes he's shy around people and hates snow,Yeti visits the mountain regularly.
The altitude is starting to get into my head but it’s not affecting my nose,that thing stunk like Yeti Shit!!!
I gave it to Dad. He needed a toothpick.
As Adam and Eve trekked up the mountain, they couldn't help but notice God's new creature. The Yetti.
He may be abominable, but at least he’s hairy!
He said he'll be right back...forgot his Depends
I realize this is a different time zone , but this is rediculous.
Cat Man Does
With your feet, I'm not sure if that guy behind us really is Big Foot.
With those feet, he can climb faster, farther, and higher - and the natural fur provides good insulation against the cold.
He has left us, quitting the Himalayan guide. He tweeted "A Yeti would not be a sucker any more!"
''Quick, don't lose him, Nirvana awaits."
I
I thought I smelt something funny.

Perhaps we should take a real low-tech approach to this crazed climb?
Yes, it really is Sasquatch!
I said: d“Are you Yeti or Yeren?” And he said:“Buzz off, little girl.”
He suggested we invest in pet food.
He forgot to get his other outfit when he changed into his fur suit.
Is it me or is there a hairy elephant in the room
"Tool use was not yet considered to be such a big deal."
God said, "I only came down to share a message with my children: "I don't have big feet as many of you seem to imply".
When I asked for the time, I didn't mean shadow time, dumbass!
He's an abominable snowman who really likes mountain climbing.
Hey, I thought it will be a private hiking trip on a remote mountain.  I don't want to be bothered by a furry giant, and who knows, he may unzip his costume when he gets hot, and  who knows what's inside the suit?
Yet I can’t slow down.
He has an advertiser’s attitude toward hairy climbs.
I understand you got a hole in one, but you have to give back the ball AND the little pencil.
He's not very fast
Don't look now but that guy's got a mountain hanging out his arse
T-shirts, boxer shorts, … ; everybody thinks he’s sold out.
I'm sorry we have to break up, turns out we are prime soul mates.
He's asked me to marry him and have little foots with him."
susan knickerbocker, Whidbey Islan
So who were you with, really?  And don't tell me it must have been the next yeti over!
Hey, is that our little Junior? Ten years can sure do a lot.
I wonder if people are right that there is a big foot. Only if we could see we might could have been famus.
Are you the Ice-Ghost of Christmas Past or Christmas Present? 
The Ice-Ghost of Christmas Future has already climbed ahead!
I wish that I was as great at climbing as Fred over there.
I think I'm beginning to come on.
I told that The North Face jackets would not keep us warm.
This is an abominable floor plan.
Free hiking!
Yes, I saw him too, but my camera phone battery was frozen. Why did I ever let you convince to drive my new Tesla today? We're totally screwed!
Now see what Yeti does!
I’m convinced he’s Alpha Yeti. 
He likes alphabet soup, 
short rhymes, acronyms, 
Writing And Reading Poop!
Excuse me, are you Han Solo
Yayo Antioch ca
Do you think that I shoukd give him my beautician phone number?
He really deserves a good hairs removal !!!
Don’t worry. He’s not going to eat us! Do you think the laxative- filled brownies we scattered along the trail did the trick?
They shave everything from under the nose to the top of the toes, then cover with manufactured clothes....and they call me "Big Foot"-I call you "Big Footprint" you dangerous creatures (smh)
Suggesting that apply to be a contestant on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is leading, Mark. He's a Yeti; he's not stupid.
Follow him!  He doesn't even have an EMS logo on his body
what if I’m the mosterrrr that’s been here all along...
On the summit assault it's every Snowman for himself.
Nephilim schmefelim.  Get back to camp.  Your breakfast is getting cold.
Guess he missed out on the holiday clothing sales
Safe guide maybe, but we enjoy our freedom, and I don’t want an abominable child.
Is that donkey kong over there?
He says he left his favorite Yeti at the top.
Good call ditching the cell phones-- otherwise we'd never bring him back to the fold.
Me neither!
Bubble tea? Oh yeah!
Move. I’m a Republican. I’m a Democrat.
A I glad that there is NO Television up here!
So, Smallfoot does exist, and is well on his way up the (food) chain.
He said that a “T” is out of the question.
The amount of litter on the trail is abominable! I tend to notice those things.
I just came down from up there , it's an emptey house .
I think we are really really
Look, it's Uncle Fred!
What makes you think this is a renovated windmill?
That bearish man will be alone at the white top there!
I told ya! Yeti! This sonovabitch!
I thought we were meeting up for ice cream
That’s the guy who fell off the mountain because he wouldn’t get out of the way.
"He mentioned something about a bomb and a bull..."
Zendaya is Meechee
Why did you wax your back hair?
Is the shoe store this way?
Who is him called? My roommate.
He can’t decide if he has sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, but he just keeps climbing.
Did you notice the really neat outfit  the big
They are lyrics! "It's only a paper moon."
He makes your grouping seem like...
This is better than anything seen on the 'Finding Bigfoot' series. We really HAVE found him!
The price is miniature
The stressed is so "Bad' in the world. "you or me " did not see(BIG )( "FOOT)

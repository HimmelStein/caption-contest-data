Did you see the rock he gave her.
She's lucky. All the men I date are gatherers.
They met at the opera
Now I know why she calls him Hun.
I hear that they met on a Viking cruise.
It's progress. Her first husband was such a Neanderthal.
So, is this your first Minnesota wedding?
“It’s about time they settled down and razed a village.”
They met clubbing.
They're registered at Blood Bath and Beyond.
...of course he 'takes' that woman. He's a viking. That's what they do.
Who knew there was a black rabbi in Norway?
I love that no one wears the pants in their relationship.
Kind of encouraging people can still find love in their middle ages.
Don’t even think of objecting.
He’s made a fortune in hostile takeovers.
I’m leaving before she tosses the sword.
They met on Ancestry.com.
She did describe him as horny.
It's a mixed marriage: he's a plunderer and she's a pillager.
I give it two harvests.
Tonight we’re gonna party like it’s 999.
Doesn't she look ravaging!
Let's hope tonight's the annual bath.
I could have done without the reading from Beowulf.
So I said to her, "Marge, you're never going to meet a real man online.  Why don't you try one of those Viking Cruises?"
I shaved my legs for this?
Her last husband’s funeral boat isn’t even cold yet.
Suddenly these bridesmaids’ dresses don’t seem so bad.
I guess this means that the reception dinner meal is all paleo.
The invitation said nine thirty, but I thought A.M., not A.D.
If there is anyone who has a reason to object to this union my advice is to keep your mouth shut.
They met on Plundr.
They plan to invade England for their honeymoon.
Now he wants to be called Erik the Wed.
They're registered at Sacks.
Did you see the size of her rock?
The pre-nup is set in stone.
Blind date, parking lot, Vikings vs Raiders.
When she said she was marrying Norman, I assumed that was the guy's name.
Wow, that's quite a rock he got her.
A black minister marrying a Viking couple under a chuppah. Now that's diversity
It's always the wife who converts.
I hear they met at the opera."
I heard she has a Hun in the oven.
It's her first marriage, and his first consensual one.
Are you as sick of Game of Thrones as me?

They go way back.
She's from Green Bay but she was always a Vikings fan.
So glad we got to pick the dresses.
I hear they registered at Blood Bath and Beyond.
I teared up when they exchanged weapons.
These Unitarian weddings are always interesting.
If anyone sees any reason why these two should not be wed, speak now and rest in peace.
I"m surprised she went with the sleeveless bearskin
They met at a rally for the President
I hear he has a long ship.
It's the same dress her mother wore.
And still, somehow, our dresses are worse.
We’re not losing a hunter. We’re gaining a gatherer.
They met on a Viking cruise, I assume."
I think the've taken this paleo thing a little too far.
Remember to go for the handle when you catch the sword.
When she said she was marrying a Viking, I thought she meant a football player.
I wouldn't object if I were you.
I hear the entire banquet is forest to table.
The matching fanny packs is a nice touch.
No, I like the outfits. I did think the Goat Sacrifice was a bit much, though.
I told her marriage is a barbaric relic of the Middle Ages, and she was like, that's the perfect theme!"
They’ve been insufferable over their viking heritage ever since they had their DNA tested.
Don't ask me. She an assistant manager at Starbucks and he's a CPA.
When Sue said she was marrying a Minnesota Viking I thought she meant a football player.
They hired a tribute band for the reception, The Pillage Veople.
After what happened to the third groomsman, I'll bet everyone else holds their peace.
At least he's better than that Neanderthal she dated in college.
When they said they were having a traditional Scandinavian wedding, I thought that meant there would be a Lutheran minister.
They registered at Sack Fifth Avenue.
Wait til you see her cut the cake.
When she told me her new guy was an international trader who specialised in foreign takeovers, that's not what I envisaged.
This is what happens when you use Ancestry.com as a dating site.
I just know, when he drags her down the isle by her hair, I'm going to cry.
After what happened to the third groomsman, I'll hold my peace.
It must be true love... She used to be a Packers fan.
But they don't look Jewish.
To pillage and to burn...
Would you believe they met at a Trump rally?
If she throws that sword, I'm not catching it.
Before we start, may I remind you this is a civil ceremony.
Not holding out hope for vegan options at the reception.
Reform Judaism has just gone too far.
This is a marriage made in Valhalla.
Do you believe Lois wore those sandals with that sword?
I used to date him and let's just say the spear is not to scale.
It's a nice ceremony, but their funerals are better.
10 to 1 they're not wearing underwear.
Oh don't worry, it's all synthetic fur.
Before Trump this would have been funny.
I hadn’t realized they’re both from Minnesota.
Where did he drag her in from?
We're just waiting for Siegfried to get here with the ring.
You think this looks silly, my other friends were Dolphin fans.
Well, the wedding invitation did say ‘dress to kill’.
I think I’ll skip the bouquet toss.
Some people just take their genetic profiles too seriously.
Stop whining. I still have the uniform from your Trek wedding.
I can't tell if I'm overdressed or underdressed.
She's taking her ancestry results very seriously.
They met while clubbing.
There’s no reception - we’re going to raid the Miller wedding.
So nice Linda's turning over a new Leif.
You won’t believe the size of the rock he gave her!
Looks like they both said yes to the dress!
apparently he has a several boats and loves to travel.
If she throws that sword, it's all yours.
Marriage is a dated, barbaric ritual.
Her arse will be Thor in the morning.
It won’t last.  He does the pillaging, she does the plundering, but neither one cooks.
I'm just grateful they didn't go with the Adam and Eve theme.
Do you know when the fat lady is going to sing?
Can't wait to hear him try to pronounce Æthelflæd.
It’s time they settle down and raze a village.
With the power vested in me by Odin and the state of Nevada...
Truly a match made in Valhalla.
I hear the ring came from a grandmother, not his... but someones!
She met him on a Viking cruise.
Just the gown cost an arm and a leg.
Psst...we’re all letting her sister catch the bridal sword, ok?
I'm starting to think the other groomsman isn't in the bathroom.
I bet she kills him first.
In high school he was voted 'Most Likely to Invade Ireland.'
Thank god this is the last season of Game of Thrones
...in sickness and in helath, until you are set ablaze on a ship and pushed out to sea.
Poor thing, everyone
 knows big feet, small sword!"
...in pillage and in famine...
They’re a perfect match.  He sacks and she pillages.
She says he’s great in the sacking
'Apparently he now wants to be known as Erik the Wed.'
Delta always mixes up my luggage too.
Whatever you do, DON'T object!
May the Norse be with you.
She’s only marrying him for his vessel.
it's a little ironic to call him the "groom"
When she said she was going Viking, I thought she meant appliances.
I'm telling you I can sense people who haven't been vaccinated.
I heard that before the DNA tests they were both Irish.
It'll never last. She's from Green Bay.
She said she would only marry a guy hung like a Norse
She said he was horny.
The reception will be Kosher Paleo
Apparently his DNA test kit said he’s one percent Scandinavian.
There is no gift list. They're going to raid Paris
Well I can tell you one thing.
They didn’t meet online.
This is officially the most Reform temple I've ever seen.
I hate to ask in this environment,but what happened to the best man?
Forever hold your peace would appear to be the prudent option, Margaret.
OMG! She’s wearing flats.
Are you going to tell Rachel about that ancestry kit mix up now or at the reception?
I now pronounce you Anglo & Saxon
I didn't want to be a bridesmaid, but I was afraid to say no.
Always the bridesmaid, never the warrior queen.
I heard they met on Plundr.
I love the way he calls her Hun.
“If anyone knows why these two should not be married, think carefully before speaking.”
They meet at the Metropolitan Opera
Did you take this woman?
When she went paleo, 
I never imagined she'd take it this far.
'Plunder, pillage, and sack'? Did they write their own vows?
I'd never marry a man with a spear that small.
Surprisingly, he's a vegan.
It's the final season of Game of Thrones, Jan, let them have their moment."
I think they're registered at IKEA.
I thought what happened in Reykjavik stayed in Reykjavik.
When she throws that thing it's all yours.
I think they're going to love the NordicTrack I got them.
An open bar reception back at the boat, then looting and pillaging until dawn.
Why did she laugh after saying ''til death do us part'?
It was a much bigger wedding before the bachelorette party.
They registered at IKEA.
I  remember when she was a Democrat.
Ughhh...always the wenchmaid, never the wench.
She's wearing her grandmother's pelt!
She slayed the dress herself.
I hear they met clubbing.
Finally ! They have been living together for ages
She says he has a huge hammer.
The bride wore hide.
I hope I catch the sword.
It's a very modern marriage, neither wears the pants.
It was sack and pillage at first sight.
Trust me.  She'll be Thor in the morning.
The rabbi has agreed to say a blessing over the Val-challah
They said no gifts; they’ve already pillaged more than they need to get started.
Did you get invited to the consummation?
No worries. It’s fake fur.
Did you take this woman to be your wife?
I'm okay with the costumes, but "Do you take this wench?" is over the top.
Bold choice going with the matching fanny packs.
I only pray there will be utensils at the reception.
She’s always gone for horny old men
I think I'll hold my peace.
So far, this has been a surprisingly civil ceremony.
The third groomsman? We lost him in the combat at the rehearsal dinner.
Don't you think the matching purses are a little much?
YOU tell him the horns aren't authentic.
Their choice of Wagner for the Wedding processional is making more sense!
She said he was a barbarian. I thought she was kidding.
I hear the mother-in-law is a real dragon.
Always a wench-maid, never the wench.
I still think it's weird that they call each other "Hun."
You should see their funerals.
Well. I think they got the "for worse part" nailed.
I heard they met on a Viking Cruise.
At the reception, they're going to sacrifice the flower girl.
Valhalla my ass, she’s Jewish and he’s Episcopal they’re going to Miami.
They met on a Viking river cruise.
Don't object. It won't go well.
This is the third 'Game of Thrones' wedding I've been in this year.
For the honeymoon, they found a lovely little town to pillage.
This is what Stockholm syndrome is, right?
Think they ever fight?
There were three groomsmen, weren't there!
If anyone objects, well, good luck with that.
I now pronounce you man and wife......you may drag the bride!
The funny thing is—they’re Jewish.
Do you promise to loot and to skirmish until death you impart?
You may smite the bride.
I thought I had fully prepared myself for a true Minnesota wedding, but I was wrong.
I can think of a lot of reasons and I'm keeping them to myself.
It's been like this since they got their DNA results. On the up side, wait till you see the smorgasbord at the reception.
He's the President's Chief of Staff
I feel like it was only yesterday when he raided her village.
They're honeymooning on a Viking River Cruise!
Someone took their DNA test too seriously.
She’s always had a thing for vintage.
I understand the condo association still hasn’t decided.
It's his fifth ring cycle.
The Wagner music is a nice touch.
They both come from old, old money
I'm so glad they finally got married, they've been engaged since the Stone Age!
It all started when she said, "I'm turning over a new Leif."
When she said she was marrying a Viking, I thought she was talking about a football player.
Oh they're rather progressive, Erik plans to be a stay at home dad, while Astrid pillages.
I thought she said he was really into Biking?
It Takes a Pillage to Raise a Child.
She had to convert. She used to be a Bears fan”
I forget. Which episode is this?
I understand they plan to sack Rome on their honeymoon...
They wrote their own battle cries.
Apparently they wrote their vows in norse code.
They've got that no "man put asunder" covered.
I heard that the third groomsman died during the bachelor raid.
Something gold, something runic, something forged, something looted.
I told her the shoes don't go with the sword.
Tsk... you know he’s just marrying her for her fjord.
I heard he’s already building a
man cave.
It's her second marriage.  She says she's turning over a new Leif.
You know, Bridget, it could have been you holding that sword
I see two good reasons I'll forever hold my peace.
Oddly enough, they met at a Mensa conference.
They met on ePillage.
I can't wait to see them cut the cake.
Just my luck, Magnus had to go off and impale the one cute groomsman.
I like theme weddings, but I’m nervous about the pillaging.
When she said she was going to take a Viking, I thought she meant a river cruise.
I'm skipping the bouquet toss.
It was love at first smite.
Love is a battlefield.
That sword is to long for those shoes.
You got them a trebuchet, too? It was still on the registry!
I'm just glad they aren't fans of 'Naked and Afraid'
She converted for him.
Trump said he wants more Norwegians.
When she throws the bouquet, I'm ducking!
They've really adopted the paleo lifestyle.
She takes ONE class about Viking history in college...
Apparently no one is going to wear the pants in this relationship.
That little belted purse goes perfectly with his outfit
I heard they booked The Pillage People for the party!
It's a good job they didn't pick the 'Star Wars' package. Otherwise, we'd all be in gold bikinis.
I hear they're going on a Viking cruise for a honeymoon.
I just assumed Viking referred to the cruise line.
Did you see the Rock on her finger?
Their wedding registry is at IKEA.
Well, I guess we can forget about anyone speaking out against the marriage.
I thought it was just a diet
At first glance they seem somewhat suited for one another.
I heard someone smote the best man at the bachelor party.
Are you having mutton or fowl?
If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined together... you better leave right now.
It’s about time.  They’ve known each other for ages.
I hear they're planning to pillage a village for their honeymoon.
I got them a nice set of daggers.
His first wife gets the cave.  He gets the paintings.
Technically, it is a yarmulke.
Apparently it's possible to pillage two continents but impossible to find a bridesmaid's dress in anything but fuschia.
I pronounce you hun and hon.
Who knew a "destination wedding" meant the twelfth century?
I hope nobody objects...
Love his purse.
He's a pillager and she's a plunderer, but somehow it works
I bet the battle to catch the bouquet later is going to be epic.
I now pronounce you viking and viqueen.
The other groomsman was cute. I wish they hadn't offered him as a sacrifice to Odin.
She claims it is a match made in Valhalla.
What do you give to the couple that has pillaged everything?
Ride of the Valkyries is just too long for a wedding processional.
It's refreshing to see a relationship work from two different sides of the fjord.
He should have no trouble breaking the glass.
The invitation did say traditional dress.
It takes a pillage...
No objections...not surprising!
I thought she said she was marrying a villager.
Don't worry. We'll hear the whole saga at the reception.
Their 23andMe results came back 90% Neanderthal.
She studied animal husbandry
The honeymoon is on a Viking Cruise ship.
Have you seen their kitchen? All Viking appliances.
I thought they said it would be a "low key" ceremony, not a "Loki" ceremony.
Did you hear the story about the ring?
How romantic! They first met pillaging this very church."
Blame it on ancestry.com
And were you taken by this man...
It's not the best way to get Norwegian citizenship, but it is a way.
'When they said 'Paleo', I thought they meant the catering.'
They're leaving immediately on their honeymoon Viking cruise.
They booked the Pillage People for the reception.
No, actually they’re both from Minnesota.
The invites said paleo, but I thought they meant the buffet.
You really have to hand it to Match.com!
I've already forgotten. Is this Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings?
I'd hate to see their first fight.
Did you see the size of his club
This wedding isn't over until the fat lady sings.
Remember, when she throws her sword over her head, we duck.
Heck no I'm not going to object to this marriage!! You object!
When I heard he was a big Vikings fan, I didn't expect this!
The matching purses are a little much.
They are a match made in Valhalla
They met on plunder.com.
I should have suspected at the bachelorette party when she sacrificed a goat.
I am so glad we ordered the bridesmaid dresses before they picked a theme.
I can't wait for the after-ceremony pillaging.
Viking weddings can't hold a candle to Viking funerals.
I hope the stone carver is getting all this.
I can see why she's marrying him - he carries a long spear.
She's seen the size of his longboat.
She's from Greenland; he's from Iceland, but somehow they make it work.
I didn’t know what post-Feminist meant either…
She'll make a wonderful battle ax.
All I'm saying is, 'knight in shining armor' is a bit of an exaggeration...
If you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, say, "Yabba Dabba Do!"
Minnesota is weird.
I hate destination weddings in Minnesota.
Do you believe she said "Yes" to that dress?
Now do you believe me that they’re addicted to Game of Thrones?
Well, at least he is NOT from a s#*thole country.
Her sword still has blood on it from her last husband.
I prefer their funerals.
Are you going to the pillage after?
I thought she said they met on a cruise..."
I think he’s reading from Beowulf.
And to think I complained about the bridesmaid dresses.
These Minnesota Vikings fans can get carried away.
Word has it that she's trading up. Her last husband was just a corporate raider.
I thought the 'until severed head or fatal impalement do us part' bit was sweet.
She will !
They met in the East Pillage.
Congratulations on turning over a new Leif
I'm not sure 'Ride of the Valkyries' is appropriate wedding music."
His best man spoke. He's no longer with us.
All the sudden she's all "pillage this" and "plunder that."
His uncle Hagar was a famous comic.
Don't you think she's taking her "3% Viking" ancestry too far?
She was originally booty.
I love the belt pouches... it's so 1990
I heard that they made their own weapons for the ceremony.
It's funny, they don't LOOK Jewish.
Do you think that broadsword makes her look fat?
It's about time....I hear they've been dating for centuries!
They met on a singles crusade.
I just love their matching fanny packs.
Well, it started with the paleolithic diet...
And, the reception is also Paleo.
A Chuppah with Wagner playing. It's meshuggah.
I'm happy that with the fourth try, the president found a woman who fits better to him.
Don't you think she's taking Opera too far?
Imagine if they had met at a Redskins game.
If you ask me, Eric's gone way overboard after getting the results of his DNA test.
And now you may drag the bride away.
I knew the wedding was supposed to be Paleo but assumed that meant the food.
Maybe always a bridesmaid is not so bad after all.
I'm not sure...I just know they're going on a Viking cruise for the honeymoon.
If you can look past all the pillaging, he’s actually a pretty great catch.
Well, at least the bridesmaid dress only cost me a goat.
She wore that same dress to her last wedding
Apparently the black tie really was optional.
Definitely going to hold my peace.
I wore spanks for this?
I planned the bachelorette party, booked the caterer, found the venue, and she still chose her sister for the blood sacrifice.
Actually she's the one who's the Vikings fan.
That's one bouquet I don't care to catch.
Wow! A heterosexual  wedding. Now that's different.
They're sacking Paris for the honeymoon.
It's the second time around for both of them, so it's less formal.
It's good to see that they have all of the tools for conflict resolution.
I hear she’s the hunter/gatherer; he mostly just shops.
Where’s the best man? Ten bucks says Siegfried forgot the Ring...
The sword adds 10 pounds.
She got tired of dating AngloSaxons.
I have always found the institution of marriage to be barbaric.
What do you get for someone who has pillaged everything?
We hunt and gather here today
Someone should explain to them what a Viking Cruise honeymoon actually is.
If anyone can show just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony, I think that’s something best kept to yourself.
One suggestion--don't offer any objections.
I knew them long before they moved to Minnesota.
The part where they exchange weapons gets me every time.
Did he just say you'll need to make some sacrifices?
I heard he proposed using Norse code.
Global warming brought them together. They were frozen in the same glacier.
That dress has been in her family for ages.
When she said she was dating the school norse, I think I misunderstood.
Should anyone here object to this union, speak now and forever rest in peace
That's one bouquet I'm not planning to catch.
He’s going to read the vows in Norse code.
.......... as long as you both might live!
He’s known as The Plunder From Down Under.
If anyone knows why these two should not be married, you better have a gun.
It's a classic 'Boy pillages girl's father's village; girl's father trades girl for return of livestock' story.
I guess they really did meet on Ancestry!
He had her at “IKEA.”
What attracted her to him wasn't the pillaging and plundering, it was that he always tidied up afterwards!
Is that a fanny pack?
Always a Norsemaid, never a bride.
He travels a lot for work.  I give them two invasions.
I'm not looking forward to the lutefisk.
Still better than her last husband.
Are we underdressed or overdressed?
OK, so maybe these bridesmaid dresses aren't so bad after all.
She knew from the first time they pillaged together.
This is nice, but the funerals are really something.
Uggs, I knew it."
He's really not that horrible.
When she said "vintage" dress, I didn't see this coming!
Here I am, always a bridesmaid, never a Valkyrie!
I doubt anyone is going to object to this wedding.
I hope they don’t take that section about ‘until death do us part’ too seriously.
I always cry when they exchange cows
Does this mean we are going to have another paleo banquet again
No, not the app. They actually met starting a fire.
My Star Trek wedding was much classier.
How seriously do you think they take the whole "until death do you part" thing?
I know they're Wagner fans but this is ridiculous.
She's turning over a new Lief.
Love conquers all.
Today it takes a pillage to raise a child.
Wish I could find a man who'd give up late capitalist modernity for me.
They said it wouldn't last, but here they are renewing their vows a thousand years later.
Did he just skip the part about anyone objecting?
Do you, Kellyanne Conway and you George Conway agree to reaffirm your marriage vows until November 2020?
It won't be long until their first fight.
Did you choose the tilapia or the reindeer for dinner?
Well they can't win a Superbowl but they sure know how to stage a wedding.
She met him at Ikea"
I always said they were a match made in Valhalla.
I can tell you right now it's gonna be for worse.
It's about time they tied the knot, they've been together for eons.”
After paying for this wedding, he's going to be "Erik IN the Red."
She did say she wanted a traditional wedding.
I like an old fashioned wedding.
They’re the last couple who didn’t meet online
Her first three husbands are in Valhalla.  Just sayin'....
Honestly? I prefer the funerals.
Both outfits from one bison hide. Hard to believe.
Do you ever feel like you're the only one who isn't into ''Game of Thrones"?
To be fair to them, 'traditional' is a pretty vague word.
He just kicked the door down and the rest is history!
What a shame about Carl impaling himself in rehearsal.  Now you don’t have an escort.
She won't admit it but I'm guessing early middle age.
By the power vested in me by the state of Minnesota...
Are you going to the after-raid?
I hear they met pillaging.
She was hoping for a big church wedding, but then he went and leveled the church.
If you tell me one more time that Vikings did not have horns on their helmets, I'll scream!
Are you SURE we know them?
At least we've got "something old" checked off the list.
We're hoping the marriage lasts, and the renunciation of all technology is just a phase.
Before we proceed with the vows, I´d like to emphasize this is a CIVIL union"
I've got to be at an Avengers themed bris by noon.
And to think she was such a Packers fan!
The broadsword was her grandmother’s
They’re UGGS
She vows to take him for better or Norse.
I hope he remembered Der Ring.
I can't remember whether I requested the chicken, the fish or the free range boar.
Yeah, like anyone else is gonna object!
She said she was going to turn over a new Leif.
They registered at Pillage & Plunder
I hear they're sacking Paris for their honeymoon...
She’s always liked the horny type.
I introduced them.  He was the one who ransacked our home.
These Viking cruises take their weddings very seriously.
It's not over till the fat lady sings.
This guy's not bad, but he's no Odin.
They're from Minnesota
Okay, now with THAT GUY dead, does ANYONE ELSE object?
I think that I'll forever hold my peace
She caught the goat head at the last wedding...
Ana and Bob took their ancestry DNA results a bit too far
They've taken a viking to each other.
The difference is she WILL get to wear the dress again.
She was a Packers fan before they met.
It's so rare to have a perfect spring day like this here in Minnesota.
Tuxedos and Spats for the men and we're in these shmattes.
Wait until you see the buffet.
She sank his ship, he ravaged her village. They were meant for each other.
I think it's sweet they've decided neither of them will wear the pants in the family.
How they met is a real saga.
'....through black plague, pestilence and fiery catapults.....'
I tell you, Ruth, it's not true love. She just got carried away.
The matching fanny packs are where I draw the line.
Did he just say, 'For better or Norse'?
I really hope this is the last Game of Thrones-themed wedding I attend.
Silly question. Of course this will be in The Times!
I bet it will be one helluva raw bar.
Fanny packs are so slimming, don't you think?
I hope the dinner isn’t Paleo, too!”
They're pillaging France on their honeymoon.
I hear her last husband was an Anglo-Saxon
The food at the reception is paleo, too.
For their honeymoon, they're sacking Rome.
Don't laugh, they could've been Packer fans.
History Channel dating app
Glacier aside, it was still a long engagement.
Long spear, short honeymoon.
After the ceremony they're sacking this church.
They're going pillaging in Britain for their Honeymoon.
She told me that all the food for the reception was "locally sourced"
I heard his family is a bunch of barbarians.
I'm more familiar with Viking funerals.
I'm afraid there will be some putting asunder."
Do you solemnly swear to take this hrdlghdrgh as your hrdlgfhhtf?
The reception is paleo.
And we had to buy dresses.
What time do we storm the reception?
Apparently she liked the way he pillages.
I don't know, but remember, they're both from Minnesota.
I’m okay with the ‘for better’ part, but I don’t even want to think about ‘for worse.’
That other groomsman really should've held his peace.
"Pagan or not, they should have checked their weapons at the door like we did. This is America, not Vinland
Notice she's not wearing white?
I wondered why they registered at IKEA.
His dad owns a cruise line.
I love how she challenges gender norms by being the one with the sword.
I don't mean to question his commitment to her, but Lars once threw a spear at me too.
They’re going on a cruise, just as soon as they get 40 oarsmen lined up”
I hear the reception is strictly paleo.
I never noticed before, but Hjalmar has really tiny hands.
And the damn dinner is going to be paleo too.
No, the weirdest part is that they're Packer fans.
It was so romantic; he proposed in the glow of a burning village.
All this time I thought she was an Packers fan
I like how they added 'pillage' to their vows.
It’s refreshing to see a couple who aren’t afraid of the inevitable conflicts.
For their honeymoon they're going to North America.
The even registered at Nordstrom
They dated for ages!
I’m afraid this relationship isn’t going to work....neither one wants to wear the pants.
If you think this is elaborate, you should see their funerals.
The nose ring belonged  to her grandmother.
Hopefully the reception has fewer blood sacrifices than the rehearsal dinner.
I heard they fight a lot.
I thought you said they met while HIKING.
Viking burials are a blast too
So they call each other, 'Hun'
They met at my son's bar mitzvah.
She recently found out that she was 1% Viking on ancestry.com...
They’ll make a beautiful horde
They haven’t been themselves since Comic Con
They told their vegan friends not to bother coming to the reception.
I never thought I'd look back fondly on that zip-line wedding in Costa Rica.
In my opinion, 5 goats was too high a price, although she did agree to throw in the sword.
You think this is something, you should have seen her grandfather's funeral!
Viking themes are so last year.  Aztec would have been just right.  Well, what can you expect? They’re from Minnesota.
If anyone dare show cause why this couple cannot be lawfully
joined together in matrimony, let them speak and,
and run like hell.
Finally a bride's maid gig with comfortable shoes!
I guess no one wears the pants in this family.
We'll it's better than a Viking funeral...
I’m not telling them that you forgot the rings.
When he finds out she's  turning vegetarian. fur's  gonna fly.
Is this your first paleo wedding?
The Valkyries are planning a big reception.
I hope they don't take the "till death do us part" thing too seriously.
Well here's another dress I will never wear again.
No one is looking at your dress.
I still don’t think they’re right for each other.
Finally!
They’ve been dating for ever.
Actually they didn't meet on the internet.
'Til death do us part' suddenly sounds ominous.
When I went out with him, he was pretty horny too.
Can you believe he voted for Trump?
...to hunt and to gather, in sickness and in health...
They were on NordicTracks when they first met.
We had to buy these dresses----and SHE shows up in buckskins??
I doubt anyone will object.
Can you count her sword as something borrowed, if she took it off a dead body?
I never really noticed that it was "For better, for Norse".
A marriage made in Valhalla.
She changed him, he’s become such a better listener.
Weary and disgruntled, we are gathered here today...
It's the new black.
I'm going to pass on catching the "bouquet"
You try telling her that the sword toss isn’t going to be a big hit.
For their honeymoon, they’re going to pillage The Hamptons.
I humbly suggest that everyone simply opt to hold their peace.
Do you think something from Ikea would be too on the nose?
You should see Bob's man cave.
They are way too into Game of Thrones.
My bet is that death will do them part pretty darn soon.
She said, “For better or Norse.”
I would ask at this time if anyone present objects, but it would appear that all the objectors are no longer with us.
Dearly behemoth...
Don’t tell Bridezilla, but I’m wearing underwear.
You may now drag the bride, by her hair, to the wedding suite.
Are they really rowing to Scotland for their honeymoon?
I'll give it three raids, tops
The third groomsman is in Valhalla - after unsuccessfully challenging the groom for the bride.
I, Hallgerd The Nearsighted, take you Olaf The Ugly..."
What do you mean obey"
On who would wear the pants, they just skirted the issue.
Yes, I tied the cans on...but I don't think they'll have the intended effect behind the boat.
So you're saying "ring bear" wasn't a typo?
I heard it was love at first fight.
If so, please respond by saying ‘you betcha.’
In their world it takes a pillage to raise a child.....
I know a reason they shouldn't be wed, but I'm not going to risk an injury.
She told me he was almost always horny, but I didn't realize she meant it this way
You may now smash your bride over the head and drag her to your tent.
I'm surprised as anyone. She's a pillager, he's more of a plunderer.
It's quite a saga.
They wanted to get married after Act 1 because he kills her in Act 2.
I can’t believe I dated him in high school.
They met when the glacier melted
It will never work. He's a Viking and she is a Packer.
When they said it was a destination wedding, I thought, 'Minnesota?'
The prenup gives her half of whatever he pillages and plunders.
When I wore calfskin on my wedding day, it meant something.
The third groomsman is conquering the reception venue.
I’ve heard he’s not much with the spear, if you know what I mean.
They met at Harvard Law School
Only a Green Bay Packers fan would object to this union.
He went to Jårøjd.
Two Norsemen of the apocalypse.
My husband is also a bit of weekend warrior.
This is why I steer clear of those genealogy websites!
The third groomsman left early to go discover America.
They found out through 23andMe that he’s 51% Scandinavian and she’s 75% cosplay.
She made him wear the helmet to cover his bald spot.
I'm only here for the grog.
I can't believe she's carrying on her wedding day.
After we plunder the reception line, let's pillage the buffet.
He had her at 'lusty wench'"
Always the wenchmaid never the wench.
They met at a football game in Minnesota."
Tinder? No, they met on Tundra.
Are you wearing bear skin? I thought only the mother of the bride could wear bear skin.
Me? No, I’m taken. I hope YOU catch the sword this time!
They wanted to get married in Norway, but then decided they could have a traditional wedding right here in Minnesota.
They were unfrozen on different continents, but matched on "actualvikingsonly.com".
Who wears  fanny-pack to a wedding?
This is nothing, wait till they release the dragons.
This is my first Orthodox Hun wedding.
You may drag the bride.
I heard she had to make sacrifices.
They really are cut from the same loincloth.
Minnesota football fans sometimes take it too far.
Always a brudepike, never a skaldmaer
They agreed that nobody would wear the pants in their family.
She's holding their prenup.
Hmm... 'Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of their women' don't seem like wedding vows to me, but maybe I'm old-fashioned.
Well, they say love conquers all.
I told that other groomsman NOT to object!
I so admire them for living off the grid.
Just wait. I GUARANTEE he'll be here shortly shouting, 'Elaine!!'
I guess fur is back in.
'I hope their marriage can endure season seven.'
I couldn't find severed heads, so i got us bouquets.
Do you, Sigurðr the Fearless, take Freya Gunhilda Roðrhurthrindiorðrgregunthalðr to be your lawfully wedded... what do you guys call it again?
I hear the reception is at all of our homes.
I hear he's taking her on a Viking cruise for their honeymoon.
Always a bridesmaid, never a battle-axe.
But do nomads ever really settle down?"
Yeah, this is pretty lame – but his funeral should be worth seeing!
Expectations are a little lower when it's a second marriage.
Do you take this sea roving, plundering, rapist pirate to be your lawful wedded husband “
I’m starting to regret the time machine.
He's upgrading. His last wife was a battle axe.
They never should have done those DNA tests.
It's not just viking funerals anymore. My nephew's having a viking Bar Mitzvah next month.
You think this is hot? You should see their funerals.
He needs to speed it up. We only have the costumes until 5
She says they’re a match made in Valhalla, but he’s just horny.
A real Viking wouldn’t  wear horns.
I used to date Thor, but he made me tho thor I could barely pith.
He's a viking and she's a barbarian,
but I think they'll make it work.
I always thought she meant he was a big football fan
You didn't get the 'it's a themed wedding' email either?
I understand they've been dating since 1066.
If anyone has objections, speak your last words now or forever hold your peace.
She hasn't told him yet that she wants to move to Green Bay.
Honeymoon's on Viking Cruises
You get the sword this time.
I'm fine with themed weddings but the Viking appliances on the registry was a bit overboard
I thought she said she took a LIKING to him.
Frankly, I find the funerals much more exciting.
It's a match made in heathen.
They met on a blind pillage.
I hear their fights are epic.
We’ll skip the ‘speak now’ portion of the ceremony
Not the kind of storybook wedding I'd envisioned.
Has anyone seen the Ring Bear?
Do you think we're overdressed?
Well I suppose that explains the longship that's been moored at the marina since Tuesday.
Now I know why she said he is so horny.
She said she wanted an old-fashioned wedding.
I thought they said 'HIKING' outfits!
I plan to repurpose this dress as mulch.”
I love the part where they exchange edged weapons.
The sexism of hideous wear-one-time bridesmaid dresses, that’s what’s barbarian.
Do you think they'll call each other Hun?
I offered to read their vows but they said they would be runed.
Speak Norse or forever hold your peace.
They're giving each other practical gifts. He's paying off her student loans, and she's made a down payment on a boat for his funeral.
Theme or no theme, it’s still a Jewish wedding. He agreed to the Huppa.
They met at IKEA...
Do you think she'll change her last name to "the Red"?
One of the groomsmen blabbed about dating her.
This is my first same-sect wedding.
In this case it’s “for better, for Norse”
I'm just hoping they have utensils at the reception.
She advertised for a horny old man.
I brought my own cutlery for the reception.
They met in Minnesota.
The mother-in-law is the real battle-axe.
They're Orthodox.
I think the ministers glasses make him look ridiculous.
I hear they're going to pillage Saxony for their honeymoon.
Viking, I thought you said a vegan wedding.
Turns our Hagar really wasn't all that horrible.
I think they've taken the Paleo Diet a little too far.
Their weddings are fun, but their funerals are brutal.
I thought you said it was a Viking Cruise wedding?
Their honeymoon?  On a Viking cruise, of course.
Oh yes, they DO take the 'til death do us part' very seriously.
The reception will include a Viking raid on the coast of Brittany.
Plunderful Wedding.
They did that ancestry thing
He met her on a trip to England....
I heard he had a “big spear” but this isn’t what I imagined.
My cousin Beatrice said, "Oh no, you don't need to bring a shield".  Well, guess who is conveniently not here.
Actually the sword is borrowed.  I have no idea what's blue.
I saw what they did to the other groomsman.
I see that you're Bjorn again."
The reception's got five different types of mead!
Do I have time to change my shoes before we storm the castle?
When she tosses the sword, I am outta here.
When she told me her fiancé was horny, this isn't what I had in mind.
They're both Visigoths, but they call each other 'Hun.'
How embarrassing — I bought her a djöfull hamar, but I see she already has one.
The matching coin purses really bring it all together.
It’s his second pillage, her first.
If she tosses the sword, you can have it.
His pillaging days are over.
He's bigger than he looks in the comic strip.
I understand Minnesota picked up his option.
Sorry you missed the bachelorette party.  We ended up invading England.
Wait, we don’t get to put them in a boat and light it on fire?
No one commits to a diet like Brittany and Todd!
He could be more refined, but he has loads of plunder.
Dearly beloved, we are hunted/gathered here today...
Do you think the buffet will be kosher?
Which one has to kill the goat?
So that's what black tie optional means
The "until death do you part" may come a little sooner than it usually does.
It won't last.  She's paleo but he's actually vegan.
Why are bridesmaid's dresses always so hideous?
I think we're overdressed.
She took a liking to the Viking.
You're  not losing a daughter you're gaining a Hun
Well at least it's not a shotgun wedding.
These Minnesota weddings are getting out of hand.
If anyone has any objections to marriage, please forever hold your peace.”
I can't wait until they cut the cake.
I heard there'll be a paleo smorgasbord at the reception.
You throw the offal and I'll tie the flagons to the barge.
Did you know that they met on the Plundr app?
He better guard his loot, she’s from the wrong side of the fjord.
I  bet they are registered at IKEA
For their honeymoon they plan to sack Shelter Island.
They're taking this Viking heritage thing too far - it was only three percent!
She’s still not letting him buy the boat.
You weren’t kidding about them being old fashioned
They've been together for, like, a thousand years.
I'm glad they finally caved in!
This is nothing! Wait 'til you see the dinner menu!
She's only marrying him for his loot.
It's not a real Game of Thrones themed wedding unless we're all murdered afterwards
It's more a hammer throw than a bouquet toss.
I always bawl at the 'blood oath' part.
This will set marriage back a thousand years
I lost three fingers trying to catch the sword at her last wedding.
I know they're excited about their honeymoon, but I think they misunderstand what really happens on a Viking River Cruise.
She should've run him through while she had a chance.
They said it was love at first pillage.
I'm here for the ale and mead.
And do you, Brunhilde the Conqueror, take this man, Lars the Impaler, to live, love, loot and pillage with 'til the fires of Valhalla bear you away?
If you ask me, they're both compensating for something.
At least it isn't a shotgun wedding
And do you, Siglinde, promise to cleave unto Thorgod, and I mean that in the best possible way.
Did you see the size of that rock?!?!
Neanderthal . . .on his mother's side.
Good thing she let us pick our own bridesmaid dresses
I'm not looking forward to the reception.
What airline did you say lost their luggage?
I wonder if she's told him she's originally from Green Bay.
If you think Viking weddings are something,you should see their funerals.
The reception pillage is always quite nice.
Why give a nice present? Ninety percent of receptions get pillaged in the first hour.
You gotta be careful
when she tosses her sword.
Frankly, I think they're taking taking this genetic heritage stuff way too seriously.....
Be careful during the Hora.
He converted.
You may now plunder the church.
I give it three raids.
Pillager? He hardly knows her!
You should see the cave she'll be living in.
They're definitely a Viking River Cruise  honeymoon.
They needed a way to justify serving pickled fish at the reception.
If there’s anyone who objects to this marriage, run!
as a couple they are very combatable
She said it makes “‘Til death do us part,” seem more achievable.
I heard they booked a Viking cruise for their honeymoon.
His ex was a real battle-axe.
He doesn't have any friends. They found these two guys selling popcorn in the theater.
Does “Arrrgh” mean “I do “  ?
I give it six months or at best till Gotterdammerung.
I just wonder why they waited so long.
Do you promise to love and cherish until it's time to send your flaming corpse into sea...
I hope the Nibelung don’t expect their ring back.
In about five years, those two will be ancient history.
That’s it! I’m giving this longship single’s cruise a shot!
I told her, "he's not that bad, it's not like he has horns."  And now this.
I hear her first husband was a real barbarian.
She settled.
And I promise to love, honour, obey and beat off all contenders with sword and club.
She tells me they're honeymooning in Minnesota.
They met on one of those Viking Ocean cruises.
Count me out when she throws what is obviously not the bouquet.
I wish their registry had been more specific than "English Countryside"
Why are all the good ones taken.
Do you, Thor, promise to give up rape and pillage and promise to barbeque and do dishes?
Notice the Norse trollop is not wearing white.
I think they'll be disappointed by their Viking Cruise honeymoon.
I hear the post wedding dinner is going to be a smorgasbord.
How long until death does them part?
We all know she wears the horns in this relationship.
One thing for sure, she's definitely not marrying a Renaissance man.
There was a mixup at the baggage carousel
To halve and to hold...
They met while pillaging.
If anyone knows any reason these two should not be joined in matrimony, unsheathe your weapon, let cry a blood-curdling scream and charge full-speed towards the podium, or forever hold your peace.
I can't wait for the cake cutting.
For their honeymoon, they're going to pillage a small town in Hawaii.
I swear she said "I love biking".
This is going to be one epic wedding.
I hear she’s already been pillaged.
Stand back when he stomps on the wine glass.
Honeymooning on a Viking Cruise, what else?
And it’s an exact replica of the Kushner’s huppah
She warned Reginald not to insist he was the best man...
They did say that it was black tie 'optional.'
No heels, great idea.  No underwear, bad idea.
That summer in Norway really made an impact.
Can you believe I almost wore the same outfit as the bride?
It was war at first sight
Her tunic is stunning.
Do you take each other to have and to hold, to maim and slaughter, in sickness and in famine, until death do everyone depart?"
So, I guess he's not so horrible after all.
Did you know she was left handed?
Theme weddings are even worse than Destination weddings
Longest dating couple ever.
Their vows just seem so arcane.
I hereby pronounce you Goth and Visigoth, you may now smash your mouths together.
You think this is embarrassing?  Try being a JETS fan.
I’m her sis, and though you may not believe this, he’s a catch.
They met in a Paleo cooking class.
What do you think of  these time traveler destination weddings?
They met on a longship cruise.
The bouquet toss is gonna be a doozy.
When do they stomp on the glass?
I can't believe she didn't understand which way to swipe on Tinder.
I, too, was surprised  Vera Wang does bear skin.
Die hard Minnesota Vikings fans
It all started on a paleo diet dating site
This is so wrong, she is supposed to have the spear.
If anyone knows why these two should not be joined in Holy Matrimony, speak now but keep in mind: her sword and his spear were sharpened moments before this ceremony.
These 23 and Me-inspired weddings are getting out of hand.
It has been my experience these blood weddings don't last.
Even Ragnar can't pull off a man purse.
I’ve heard they fight all the time.
I think they went too far with the paleo diet.
I won't cry at this wedding, I just hope they don't kill each other.
Did she just vow 'For Better or Norse'?
Well . . . she finally caved!
I thought she said he was striking, not Viking.
Did he say "broadsword" or "broad's sword"?
At my wedding Ralph was a Klingon and I was a Vulcan.
I'm not really into cosplay, but he did get her a Viking range.
I won’t be running to catch her bouquet
At least SHE can wear it again!
They'll be pillaging this fall near New Brunswick."
And then he says I yabba-dabba-do.
What happens in Valhalla stays in Valhalla.
I'm glad she picked Game of Thrones for the theme, she was considering Naked and Afraid.
He's Reform.
Not sure having the wedding on a Viking River Cruise was a good idea.
She had us spend hundreds of dollars on these dresses and she wore that?
I know Viking Funerals get all the fanfare, but this is lovely, too.
I love these genderfluid weddings where no one will wear the pants in the family.
I never thought she would find the right man.
This is the third theme wedding I have been in this year!
They're really taking the battle of the sexes seriously.
Do you promise to rape, pillage and plunder together as long as you shall live?
Is there anyone left to contest this union?
Theme wedding? or Met Gala
wannabes?
You may now toot his horns.
I now pronounce you very strange.
Well, they seem prepared for anyone who can't hold their peace.
They’ve decided to go on a Viking Cruise for their honeymoon.
The funerals  are more exciting.
Which bridesmaid will catch the sword?
I never thought she'd fall in love with a corporate raider!
All I know is that she met him on Tinder and told me he was horny
This is the third time she's forsaken all others.
What's with the purse?
You don't think it's Stockholm syndrome?
When she texted me about the ring and the white Norse I thought it was a typo.
They are hardcore Vikings fans, that's why.
This is the second marriage for each of them. They know what to expect.
It’s stunning.  She’s not registered at Amazon.
Cummerbunds AND vests on the groomsmen? Tacky...
I wonder what will happen to his 'man cave' now that they are married."
They're gonna kill on the dance floor.
This was a long time coming.
She looks fat in that bearskin.
I can't wait to see the bride slice the cake with her sword.
I hate these time travel destination weddings.
They both smiled when he said "till death do us part".
You should have seen them before marriage counseling!
And do you promise to love, honor and obey until one of you is cremated on a burning ship?
I guess animal skins don't come in white.
Good luck pronouncing them Tryggvi and Cnut.
I got them a stove.
That’s just great.  These bridesmaid dresses were crazy expensive, and she gets away with showing up in the same animal skin tunic she wore at her first wedding.
I hear that after this they're going pillaging in Hawaii.
The Bride insisted we had to wear these ridiculous clothes.
They hold the record for "longest engagement ever".
I'm so glad she talked him out of Star Wars garb.
I didn't realize Jane was Vikish
and now you enter the Game of Marriage
He needs a green card.
It's about time, they have been dating for centuries.
Well, that’s what happens when you tell Alexa to order “striking” wedding clothes.
I think Viking Cruises has taken it a bit too far.
I think I'm going to skip the bouquet toss.
I hope she doesn't regret converting.
She's born again, he's going to Valhalla.
These destination weddings are getting out of hand.
Do you know if Hagar has a brother?
Is this your first Norwegian wedding?
Check out the size of that rock on her finger!
They're sacking England for the honeymoon.
Word is all the mead you can drink at the reception.
“For their honeymoon they’re invading Europe.”
Instead of a limo, they rented a yak.
He raided Jared.
She really holds the sword in their relationship
Is that Fred or Barney?
So romantic, getting married at half-time.
Finally...they've been engaged for 1100 years.
On their first date she asked him, "What's in YOUR wallet; and he said, "A condom."  She decided that qualified him as a feminist,  and she proposed.
They are honeymooning in Stonehenge.
On the bright side, Astrid's Ikea gown only cost $14.95 and it will still fit in 20 years.
I can't believe I got dragged into this.
Do you take this raper and pillager to be your lawfully wedded husband?
What Thor has joined together, let no Norseman put asunder.
You're sure this is the right wedding?
Themed weddings are soooo 1000 years ago.
Their honeymoon cruise includes a raiding party.
They agreed that nobody will wear the pants in their relationship.
Turning my dress into a rug. You?
That hat makes him look horny.
She's no Rhine maiden, I can tell you that for sure.
I've never seen a Viking chuppah.
Do you promise to rape, pillage and slay?
“They met at work. He is the Commissioner for the Department of Housing and Urban Development”
At least she has the decency not to wear white.
Oh sure, they get to wear comfortable clothes.
After the fat lady sang, I thought, '"Really, there's more?"
They met at Walmart.
Well, Love is a Battlefield.
It took ages and ages for them to find each other.
Can't wait 'til they break the glass.
You thinking what I'm thinking?  How is he going to get the ring on her left hand?
They’re not wearing underwear.
I can never remember longship reception etiquette. Do bridesmaids row on the left or right?
Can you believe she said "yes to the dress" ?
I always cry when they lock horns.
I'm not staying for the reception. You?
If he doesn't hold her, she'll halve him.
The prenup is brutal.
Her wedding dress still looks better than what we are wearing.
I give it five winters, tops.
They're invading England right after the ceremony
Is that a Vera Wang?
Quick, the nose ring.
Not only the good ones are gone.
Oh, she married a Norse, not a nurse!
They've taken this "23 & me" thing a bit too far,don't you think?
I am okay with the theme so long as we get cake and don’t have to eat roadkill.
The gall of her -- dressed like that and making us wear these awful bridesmaid's dresses.
I heard it's an open mead bar.
They're rented.  All his groomsmen were slain by the Irish.
They’re going to plunder Europe for the Honeymoon.
”You May now fight to the death.
A little jazz, a little Ring Cycle--not your everyday theme wedding, is it?!
They met on NobleSavages.com.
I thought she was marrying the one with the hammer.
The bridal registry suggested all Viking appliances.
Let me guess...they're going on a Viking cruise for their honeymoon!
Only true opera buffs could interpret The Ring this literally.
He killed the best man, so you’ll  be going stag to the reception.
Did you remember to put the “Just Married” sign on the back of their longboat?
I just love her gown's plundering neckline.
I'm just glad there is an open bar."
It does take nerve to wear LL Bean duck boot knockoffs.
So  quaint. He’s still horny.
Their funerals should be fun
I'm confuced,
Is she a coverted Hun or is he  converted Visigoth?
I heard The Pillage People are playing the reception.
I give it two raids.
Who knew Pillage.com had a dating app?
Brenda always preferred pillaging to partying"
You may now head butt the bride.
I HAVE to find out where she bought those shoes.
They wanted to be ready for any objectors.
I am not looking forward to the garter toss.
And do you promise to love, honor, and not bludgeon each other to death?
It’s a match made in Valhalla.
God, everything these days is Scandinavian chic.
You may wrestle the bride.
She always said she wanted a Viking in the kitchen.
I don't think they will have a Vegan option at the reception.
At least we know it’s not a shotgun wedding
That hemline. She always had a great eye for fashion.
They met on a cruise.  He rowed. She mended the sail.
If I see a sacrificial fertility goat, I'm walking out.
I still think the mace would have gone better with that dress than the sword.
And do you, Ivanka, take this Great American to be your husband?
At least we know why the gift registry specified Viking.
I hope they don't already have a toaster.
They're gonna explore America for their honeymoon.
Just be happy they aren't Bears fans Monica.
I gave 10 pelts
How about that, a vow to never again use deodorant.
I'm gonna pillage one of those groomsmen.
This wasn't her wedding day fantasy when we were teenagers.
They really ran with this Minnesota football thing, huh?
On the other hand, they're both adept at writing code"
I'll bet their limo is out back eating hay.
I hear they're spending their honeymoon on a Viking cruise
I can’t believe they went with spats.
Do you think he’s good in the ransack?
They wanted it to be both traditional AND progressive.
I'm outta here when she turns around and throws the sword.
She's always had a thing for the 'bad boy' type.
They're going to rediscover America for their honeymoon!
If only we didn't have to hold these thistle bouquets.
It’s so cute when she calls him Hunny.
The reception buffet is 'Norvegan.'"
I hear they’re going to pillage in Hawaii.
The honeymoon will be with a Viking crew not on a Viking cruise.
I thought she said they were going hiking on their honeymoon.
This isn't what I thought when they said, "Traditional Attire".
Check that sword.  She''l be wearing the codpiece in that marriage.
I heard we're eating mutton
I love the part where they promise to burn, pillage and loot till death do they part.
I wish they'd converted to Christianity before they burnt down the church.
I now pronounce you goth and visigoth. You may pillage and burn.
They met at MOMA. Go figure.
I wonder where they’re raiding on their honeymoon.
It's a pity that Helga slayed the groomsman at the rehearsal.
I do.. All though I probably shouldn't.
I can't believe they're wearing fanny packs at the altar.
Are you staying after the ceremony for the for the looting and pillaging?
I think she went for the guy with the biggest horns.
They plan to pillage and plunder for a whole year before starting a family.
And for their honeymoon they're going to loot the Saxons
She says they met on that new Pillage & Plunder theme dating site.  He gets to be Thor tonight but we all know who going to really be "Thor" tomorrow.
You may now club the bride.
She made us wear these fancy bridesmaid dresses and she shows up in that?
I suggestes Mediterranean but no, they had to go Paleo.
Isn't this carrying their paleo diet a little too far?
Norseman? I thought you said he was a horse man.
She stepped on his spear at yoga and the rest is history.
Valhalla is the ultimate 'fuck you' destination wedding.
Paleo isn’t for everyone.
So when did "something sharp" replace old, new, borrowed and blue?
....in famine and in pillage....
I give it six months before one of them wants to be pushed out to sea.
See, I told you she would wear vintage
Actually, I thought the dragon ring bearer was a nice touch.
Animal skins make me look fat!
Ancestry analysis does have consequences.
They've written their own battle cries.
The reception should be fun.

Brumhilde like Thor, but he was wasn't tough enough for her!
Oh the blubbering when she said yes to the dress!
check the spats
She told me her true love is one of those marvelous Avengers.
Apparently, they’ve had the whole affair pillaged.
The paleo diet must have backfired.
I don't know why we had to dress up if the groomsmen didn't.
It's not your typical Renaissance Fair wedding.
I was only kidding when I
*fart*
They told me Elon Musk is paying for the honeymoon
Are you his sister or his aunt?
Dearly Beloved, Who is the Wagnerian wedding planner?
Gretchen and Olaf, I now pronounce you wife and sexual abuser.
I  heard they're honeymoon is going to be one of those river cruises.
I'll give them 2 years max.
Are they actually wearing matching boots?
They may plunder but the guest are still more pleasant then the guest at the Royal Wedding
They are cutting the cake with a guillotine!
You May now harpoon the bride
I AM KING AND QUEEN OF HUHU LAND 
WE ARE HERE ON INVITATION
I was wondering how they pared down the guest list.
I didn't know I was supposed to wear formal attire!
Nowadays they’ll let anyone marry. How barbaric?
I hope their marriage outlasts their game.
Well, she did say it was going to be a lacey wedding!

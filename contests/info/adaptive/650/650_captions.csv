I wish you’d come in when it was just a chip on your shoulder.
The good news? You’re not delusional.
You were better off with a chip on your shoulder.
I treat depression and obsession, but not compression.
Tell me about your first crush.
I could begin with the obvious--but why don't you go first?
Last week it was a monkey on your back.
So, the last thing you remember was a roadrunner and a coyote?
And you think this is the cause of your erectile dysfunction?
Well, let's start with the obvious.
Well, usually when someone tells me that, it's a metaphor.
This could be the main reason for your erectile dysfunction.
I'm just here to give you the tools, you'll have to do the heavy lifting.
Your time's almost up.  Are you sure there isn't anything else you want to get off your chest?
No wonder you're unable to have an erection.
Otherwise OK?
On the plus side, you’re using the word ‘literally’ correctly.
What's your gut feeling?
Let's begin our session with some deep breathing.
can you feel the pea now?
You're in luck. My next patient thinks he's Superman.
The good news is that this problem is not in your head.
Now, imagine it's Styrofoam.
I mean besides that.
...and suddenly it hit me.
"You know, for the first time in my career I think the problem might not be your mother"
You might be more comfortable if you take off your shoes.
It's $200 for the session, plus $2,000 for the forklift.
Thus far, this is the only effective treatment we've found for erections lasting longer than 4-hours.
I see you've gained weight but it's good that you've got a handle on it.
Seems to me that you're the underlying issue.
Ask yourself, does it spark joy?
You ripped off the ankle bracelet - what did you expect?
The first step is acceptance.
Why do you think you can't get an erection?
Can you think of anything concrete that might be causing your anxiety?
I think I know the cause of your erectile dysfunction.
Any other pressing matters to discuss?
If you upgrade to Premium Care, I can get that removed.
I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong.
So, what brings you in today?
You seem obsessed with your weight.
And how long since your last erection?
You can't change the fact that it's there, but you CAN change your reaction to it.
First I applaud your proper use of “literally”.
Any other symptoms?
We'll pick this up next week.
No, in this instance I agree - it’s not all in your head.
Take an anvil and call me in the morning.
I can't help you if you wont tell me what's bothering you.
Let's pick this up again next week.
It's a lamp shade, for goodness sake.  Just lift it off you.
In my opinion, you're putting too much pressure on yourself.
You seem depressed.
Depressed in what way?
But does it spark joy?
Maybe it’s not all in your mind.
I said to take an Advil"
Sorry about that. It was supposed to hang ominously above you.
Now don't all your other problems seem trivial?
So let me get this straight. You clicked "Accept" without reading the terms and conditions?
Sometimes therapy only works under pressure"
I can help you, but it’s you who must do the heavy lifting.
My first question is how you got in here.
I sleep OK, but I have trouble some mornings getting up.
I've had too many people leave without paying.
It's just until we verify insurance.
Hmmm. So roughly how long has it been since you've been unable to achieve an erection?
Well we can talk about it, or we can just get a crane.
Let's start with your weight problem.
I suggest not starting your day watching the news.
Yes, normally it is a metaphor.
Let's start by getting a belt with a different buckle
Define 'pressing concern'.
Would you describe your anxiety as heavy, paralyzing, or crushing?
I think your delusions are becoming more concrete.
My mistake; I assumed you were speaking figuratively
How bad is the pain…on a scale of 1 to 16 tons?
This may take more than one session.
I'm Jungian but more importantly, I'm also a certified crane operator.
When you made the appointment, I just assumed  you were speaking metaphorically.
Now, try to visualize a crane.
We could attempt psychoanalysis, but I'd actually recommend a crane.
Yes, but what would you say is your most pressing issue?
When you said "literally" over the phone I thought you meant figuratively.
Let's leave it there for now.
“Your hour is up. Can I call you a crane?”
I noticed you shaved your head, you want to talk about that?
My childhood was fine. Please just call 911.
Unfortunately we’ve run out of time. 
Let’s pick that up next week.
It'd be a coincidence but, yes, it's possible you're having a heart attack.
Perhaps I wasn't clear. Our time is up.
When you said you've been under pressure, had put on a ton of weight and were having trouble getting out of bed in the morning, I suspected something else.
Murray, sometimes a two-ton anvil is just a two-ton anvil.
I've seen bigger
But no tingling or shortness of breath, right?
Anything pressing you’d like to discuss?
Well, why do YOU think it's there?
So you say you fell victim to a pyramid scheme?
Could you be more concrete?
It can be so hard to get over your first crush.
To begin your therapy, I want you to know that your feelings are real.
Now, imagine it's a feather ...
I know it took a lot for you just to come in today.
That's the worst case of writer's block I've ever seen.
Side effects may include difficulty breathing.
How long have you been struggling with your weight?
Good. Now you are using the word "literally"  correctly.
Once again Robert, It's not guilt, it's a concrete pylon.
If you prefer, we can tell your parole officer you are ready for an ankle bracelet.
And you're sure you saw a beeping roadrunner right before this?
Yes, it probably is more effective than a condom.
I just provide the tools. YOU have to do the heavy lifting.
Visualize a crane...
Yes Carl, that's the proper usage of 'literally'
You say you have a ton of issues, but I see just one.
For most of my patients, this is just a metaphor.
Frankly, I’m surprised to hear about the headaches.
I think I’ve identified the cause of your erectile dysfunction.
Really? Does this look like a metaphor to you?
First of all, your under too much pressure.
I see you've traded in the albatross.
It seems to me that your problem is your weight.
I can't remove it until you've met your deductible
How's the restless leg syndrom now?
You seem to be in the same place you were when we ended our last session.
You wanted the other Dr. Crane.
When you described your problem over the phone, I assumed you were speaking metaphorically.
Looks like you put on some weight.
I'm sorry we're out of time. We'll pick it up next week.
Anything you’d like to get off your chest?
Have you considered switching to similes?
I don't think it's all in your head.
You know I can't help you if you won't tell me what's wrong, Steve.
Well, I think I’ve figured out what’s been weighing on you
You never forget your first crush.
I think it's time that we begin discussing the possibility that it's not your imagination.
In the future, metaphors will be just fine"
Sorry, dear, but it's what the doctor ordered for an erection lasting more than four hours.
You also mentioned a monkey on your back?
I think in your case it's not just a feeling.
A metaphor would have sufficed, Mr. Richards.
We're making progress...last week it was the weight of the world.
When you said you had a weight problem I must say I pictured something different.
And what made you yell, "More cowbell!" in the first place?
Why do YOU think you can't get off the couch?
What do you consider your most pressing problem?
Don’t exaggerate, it’s a lamp shade for God’s sake.
The good news is that you're absolutely not hallucinating.
Well, on the up side,  we seem to have got rid of the monkey on your back.
Did you ever consider a forklift instead of analysis?
Would you like to get anything off your chest?
Sometimes a crushing weight on your chest is just a crushing weight on your chest.
You'll feel better once you get it off your chest.
Well you said you wanted non-pharmaceutical options.
Well, you didn't like the inkblots at first either.
Have you given any thought to leaving the Trump Administration?
So, what brings you here?
Can you talk to me about your most pressing 
issues?
This could explain your ED.
It doesn't spark joy but it's hard to throw away.
You and I both know that the block isn't really the problem, right?
What was that pressing matter you wanted to discuss?
I see you spent the weekend with your mother.....
My diagnosis: obsessive-compressive disorder.
Well,  at least we've got a handle on it now.
...and at what point did you realize it was too much cowbell?
Doc, is this is the only way to cure an erection lasting longer than four hours?
Describe this pressure. Are you feeling it now?
The judge ruled that an electronic bracelet was too risky...
We'll get to that.
It makes that chip on your shoulder seem insignificant.
I think you are regressing. Last visit it was just a can of worms.
You seem to be getting enough iron.
I preferred the monkey on my back.
If it doesn't bring you joy, just get rid of it.
Are your hiccups gone?
I believe the pressure you are feeling is very real.
Why is it always me who has to get up when the phone rings?
Sorry, that was a lot to lay on you all at once.
So you say you have trouble getting up in the morning...
And nice use of the word 'literally,' by the way.
It was a gift from my mother
Sorry, I'm afraid that your insurance has denied the metaphor.
To be clear, I was asking what was weighing on your mind
What did you THINK Panini Therapy would be like?
In the dream, I was Wile E. Coyote...
Interesting - usually when clients first come to see me they have a lot on their minds.
I said treat yourself with Advil.
Please.  I get the symbolism.
Where would you like to start?
You seem to be under a lot of pressure
OK, Let’s move on to more pressing matters.
Shall we start with the obvious?
Just let me know when you're comfortable and we can start
It appears we have tons to discuss.
You need a crane operator, not a therapist.
That’s all the time we have. We’ll pick this up next week.
Anything else you want to get off your chest?
How long, would you say, have you had erectile dysfunction?
You understand that treating a metaphor can take a very long time, right?
...the good news is it’s not a heart attack
Your constant need for attention is what we've been working on for months, Alan. And I know it's made out of styrofoam.
Good news - you asphyxiated that monkey on your back.
What do YOU think the problem is?
And yet you say there is nothing you want to get off your chest.
You're right, of course. It's not all in your head.
Let's start with the obvious -- your socks don't match.
I’d like to refer you to a colleague of mine. Her name is Dr. Crane.
What I'm hearing is that you're under a lot of pressure.
No, it’s not your imagination.
It looked a lot smaller on Amazon Prime.
I charge a flat fee.
I suppose I'll be charging you a flat fee.
In these dreams you’ve been having, are you the roadrunner or the coyote?
So, anything in particular you would like to discuss today?
Well, it's definitely not all in your head...
But how does it make you feel?
How's that erection now?
So, what's holding you back?
Do you want to tell me what’s troubling you?
You're my only patient who uses "literally" correctly.
So...what seems to be the problem today?
Well I can see you're under a lot of pressure.
Sure, we could just have it removed, but is that really what you want?
Can you tell me what brought you in today?
There now. Your other problems don’t feel so bad, do they?
If it doesn't spark joy in you, Steve, you really should throw it out.
Just make yourself comfortable.
I don't know, I just can't seem to get myself out of bed in the morning.
We'll have to run tests to rule out any physical causes.
I’m sorry, but I’m only licensed to treat metaphors.
You’re clearly depressed.
Now that you can't access your phone, let's talk!
I think arachnophobia is the least of your problems.
#Mammograms are worse.
Before we start, I should tell you I charge by the pound.
I think it was better when the elephant was in the room
Instead of therapy, perhaps you should seek a crane.
You never want to go anywhere.
Now imagine that you’re floating in a pool, without a care in the world.
I'm prescribing you an anti-pressant.
Does it hurt when you cough?
I see you've put on a few pounds since we last met.
Yes, I can see that sir. But how does it make you feel?
Well Mr. White, since you said you'd like to better empathize with women, I thought we might start off by letting you know how a mammogram feels.
Let’s face it, you have been the victim of a pyramid scheme.
Some patients on medication do experience weight gain.
Well, actually, you are under quite a lot of pressure.
Any progress since our last session, Mr. Panini?
And what do you see as the primary source of your depression?
Of course it’s heavy only if you believe it’s heavy.
Side effects include sudden weight gain.
Yes, Mr. Ryerson, I got the metaphor.
I can't say that I fully appreciated the gravity of your situation, until today.
Why is everything always about you?
I know we’re in the middle of some heavy stuff, Greg, but can you please take your shoes off the furniture.
I didn't know ACME still made those.
I've been having trouble getting it up lately.
Tell me honestly, Sam, is there something you want to get off your chest?
This is going to take more than one session.
I’m a psychiatrist, Mr. Devlin, not a crane operator.
First of all, let me commend you on the proper use of "literally"...
I can see you’re depressed.
Other than that, everything good?
No, I can't honestly say it's all in your head.
Do you want my medical opinion or my metaphorical opinion?
I've counseled Atlas. You, sir, are no Atlas.
And what’s the second thing you’d like to get off your chest?
Actually, it might not be a panic attack.
Have you thought that maybe it IS heavy and it's NOT your brother?
So you literally meant 'literally'.
Can we talk about something else?
If you're not going to tell me what's bothering you, I won't be able to help you.
Let’s take a moment and let that sink in.
Do you have something you want to get off your chest?
But would losing the weight make you any happier?
So, you are saying you've felt this way since November 8, 2016?
Now that you mention it; 
Where IS the cat?
So, how do you feel about the load being taken off of Fanny and being placed right on you?
Be aware of it, but don’t dwell on it.
Before we get started, is there anything you would like to get off your chest?
I'm a psychiatrist. I can only address things that weigh on your mind.
I can tell you have some pressing issues.
I'm afraid your time is up.
Because I'm sick to death of your levitating, that's why.
I can assure you it is not all in your head.
Overbearing in what way?
First the elephant in the room, and now this.
I should warn you, 
analysis can take years.
Usually it's metaphorical.
I took the weight off Annie and put the load right on me.
Yes, I do struggle getting out of bed."
No, it’s definitely not in your head.
I'm going to have to refer you to Dr. Crane.
It’s a special therapy for people who misuse the word “literally”.
I have a theory concerning your sexual dysfunction.
Admitting you have a weight problem is the first step to solving it.
Harold! Get your shoes off the couch!
The good news is that we got the monkey off your back.
You'll feel better getting it off your chest.
At least you no longer have that monkey on your back.
So, what would you like to talk about?
Well at least you’ve made progress differentiating “literally” and “figuratively.”
It’s always all about you, isn’t it?
Seriously, Joe?  No thoughts at all as to what might be leading to your erectile dysfunction?
This should fix the "longer than 4 hours" issue with your Viagra.
That will be $200 for the session and $1,000 for the crane.
No Mr. Davis., it's not all in your head. I can see you really are under a lot of pressure.
And...our hour is up.
Before we start, is there anything you want to get off your chest?”
Fine, but for two dollars, I’d get them pressed a the cleaners.
It's the gravity of the situation that is really getting to me.
There we go, now you can't run away from your feelings
Is there anything you want to get off your chest?
Next week we’ll weigh your options.
Let's work on other ways to control one's libido, shall we?
Well, we got the monkey off your back...
My other therapist just uses a blanket.
Have you felt any other metaphors lately?
Therapy is not meant to be comfortable.
I'm afraid that’s time. Let’s pick this up next week.
Just try to take a deep breath !
We'll get to that in a minute, but first let's talk about my fee.
Other than that, any other problems?
The hardest part of weight loss is keeping it off.
Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
I should let you know, I charge by the pound.
Well, you WERE chasing a roadrunner.  What else did you expect?
You seem to be handling the pressure well.
In the future, let’s only use metaphors.
Go ahead.  Get it off your chest.
True.  But everyone has an excuse for not getting up in the morning.
Does it spark joy?
Any pressing issues?
And you say it was a gift from your mother.
I don't think you fully realize the gravity of the situation.
It was then that Larry realized the homeopathic phsychologist might not have been the best choice.
1 realize that you are under a great deal of pressure
All signs point to clinical compression.
Do you mean that literally or figuratively?
Very few of us visualize our burdens as well as you do.
We should start by discussing how literally you take things.
Think Styrofoam
I think I know what your problem is.
So you’re telling me you’re having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning?
How can I help you?
So is there anything you would like to get off your chest?
What’s up?
What doesn't crush you makes you stronger!
This should train you not to overdose on Viagra.
I see your in-laws are still living with you
Until you can abandon the delusion that you have a man underneath you, we won’t be able to make much progress.
I see you have concrete problems.
I’m sensing there’s something you’d like to get off your chest.”
That's not a metaphor, it's a simile.
Bill, I told you last week, I understand the metaphor.
It's not all in your head.
Any other pressing issues?
Literally or figuratively?
''So, that takes care of the monkey on your back, and the albatross around your neck. The thorn in your side will have to wait for next week."
What would you like to get off your chest?
Before we wrap up, are there any other pressing issues you’d like to discuss?
The remote is probably under it too.
You're so dramatic -- not every crushing chest pain is a heart attack.
You can’t change the weight. You can only change yourself.
In my professional opinion, your level of anxiety is quite appropriate.
So, tell me what's wrong.
Walter realized that the worst of it was her crushing silence.
Any pressing problems?
Tell me more about your panini dream
What brings you here today?
Can you forget about Trump's presidency for a moment?
First, let's see what altering your medication does.
So, what seems to be your problem?
On the flip side, it appears your use of the word “literally” was grammatically correct after all. I apologize.
Is it a simile or a metaphor? I never remember."
I see you brought your mother for today’s session...
When you said it was weighing on you I assumed you were being metaphorical.
When I asked you to come to today's session prepared to discuss how you feel about being one of Trump's lawyers, I expected you to simply talk about it.
Does it bring you joy?
Don't ever try Viagra again.
But how does it make you feel on the inside?
This is progress; when we started it was the weight of the world.
And how do you feel figuratively?
It's called metaphor therapy.
Yeah, but don't your other problems seem less important now?"
What do you mean ‘we’ll pick this up next week’?!
Let’s move on to other pressing issues.
Sorry, I just get so tired of people saying "literally" when it doesn't apply.  Please continue....
You said this was pressing.
Are you sure this is the best way to treat an overdose of viagra?
So, is there anything you'd like to get off your chest?
Why don't we pick it up here next week.
I may need to refer you to my colleague, Dr. Crane.
Have you tried not watching the news?
When did you first decide that you have a weight problem?
You're letting your weight define you.
Let’s start with your most pressing issue.
When you described your problem over the phone, I assumed it was a metaphor.
Have you always been underweight?
So, what would you like to get off your chest for today’s session?
You need to see it as an opportunity.
So, what’s on your mind today
How does it feel to have the weight off your shoulders?
I want you to consider the possibility that maybe it’s all in your head.
I want you to imagine the weight being lifted because your insurance doesn't cover this.
This is why you shouldn’t say “literally” when you really mean “figuratively.”
It's not the world, Jim, it's just a weight.
When I suggested you bring something concrete to our next session this is not what I had in mind,
Does it feel more like a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks?
Have you considered more reps and less weight?
I'm starting to think your problems may be physical, rather than psychological
You’re finally grasping the gravity of the situation.
I'm just saying it wouldn't kill you to lighten up once in a while.
Looks like you fell for a pyramid scheme
No, you’re not having a heart attack. A heart attack feels like an elephant is sitting on your chest. That’s not an elephant.
I think this obsession with your weight is just a cover-up for deeper issues, Bob.
Now, I want you to take a deep breath.
But on the other hand, some people take things too lightly.
Oh, there are no therapeutic benefits, Mr. Phelps. I just don't like you.
I will get to your feeling of having a crushing weight on your chest in a moment, but first I want you to just try and breath deeply and relax.
To paraphrase Freud, sometimes a ten-ton weight is just a ten-ton weight.
Try to think of a metaphor to describe this oppressive feeling.
I’ll be frank with you, you’re not imaging it.
Just a few more sessions and I should be able to pinpoint the source of your pain.
"I know a lot of shrinks blame the mother, but she WAS operating that crane.
Anything particularly pressing you would like to start off with today?
Most problems are mental.  Yours is not.
My wife couldn't make it, but she sent a replacement.
It seems that you don't do well under pressure.
How’s this new strategy working to control your impulses Mr. Weinstein?
Technically, it's called a Panini Complex.
So, let's begin with you telling me what you think is holding you down.
I see you got smashed again last night.
Do you have any pressing issues today?
I'm surprised you're able to get out of bed in the morning
The safe word is "Panini".
Yes, removing unsightly metaphors is my specialty.
Other than that, what kind of week have you had?
No, you need to keep it there until you learn to properly use "literally".
These metaphors are getting out of hand, Todd.
No, I said WAIT on the couch !
We're all under a lot of pressure Bob.
Perhaps it was a mistake to begin with visualization.
I'm under a ton of pressure right now
Sure, a crushing sense of pressure in your chest could be a symptom of anxiety, but first let's talk about your inability to get out of bed.
Would you like to get something off your chest?
Well, I see you got that monkey off your back.
I must insist that you remove your shoes before our session
I'd say you're under a little more than just the weather.
I don't find you strange at all.  Most people come here wanting to get something off their chest.
Oh please, if it was the weight of the world you'd be dead.
So where do you think this "pressure" stems from?
Have you always had issues with your weight?
When did you first notice it?
Only two more years of this Administration.
You seem to be preoccupied with your weight.
I'm sorry but the 50 minutes is up.
On the lighter side, it does give you a bit of gravitas.
Yes, it does make you look thinner.
Everybody feels hard-pressed sometimes
Yes, visualization is often a helpful tool. But in your case, I'm going to recommend a large crane.
So, you're telling me you're under a lot of pressure...
I see you have issues with your weight.
So, exactly how long have you been struggling with your weight?
I can see why you're depressed.
Do you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning?
While we await the crane, suppose you tell me a little about your mother.
Anything new this week?
Well at least we know its not all in your head.
What exactly do you mean when you say you've got a ton of problems?
Believe me, Mr. Mercer, you're that lucky one in a million whose load is merely literal.
Only when I laugh
Well, you're obviously under a lot of pressure.
I have the sense there’s something you need to get off your chest.
Next session let's just try using the metaphor, Mr. Gallagher.
And that isn’t even why I’m here
There are a number of alternative treatments for hyperactivity.
'So many metaphors but unfortunately, our time is up'.
Try thinking of what you're grateful for.
Yes I understand that you’re under a lot of pressure.
I feel for you, but I had Atlas in here yesterday.
It could be psychosomatic
Wait, wait, don’t tell me.
Every time it's your turn to take out the trash you come up with some excuse.
And in what way do you think it might not be just a metaphor?
Who says you can’t hold a good man down?
Let's talk about what you think is really weighing you down.
Ok, so they took the load off of Franny and then they put the weight on you and then what?
It started as a metaphor.
If only there were a metaphor to describe your situation....
Being literal seems to be important to you.
I'm only here to facilitate Mr Perkins, you have to do the heavy lifting.
Wouldn't a chastity ring have been a better choice?
No more surprise erections? The treatment's a success!
I suppose you think this is somehow my fault.
So tell me, how can I be of help?
Your friends will be impressed until they realize it's styrofoam
I'm sorry--our time is up.
I see that your wife is pretty adamant that you stay in therapy.
Ok, plan B: try lifting your spirit.
From NPR, National Psychiatric Radio, this is “Weight Weight...Don’t Tell Me!”
All my clients feel better when they leave.
When you said “literally” on the phone, I thought you were just using it incorrectly.
I think you're finally starting to understand the gravity of your situation.
Now, what is that pressing matter you wanted to talk about?
Now do you understand what “literally” means?
At least you got that monkey off your back.
My practices may be unorthodox, but they have a very high success rate. Most patients don't come back after their first session
Is there anything else that you would like to get off of your chest?
How long has your weight bothered you?
Now that we have your sleep walking cured is there anything else you want to talk about?
Tell me what's on your mind.
Is there anything else you'd like to get off your chest?
What would you like to talk about, Mr. Panini?
We need to talk about your unpaid bill before we talk about getting that off your chest.
16 tons, and what do you get? Long term therapy and deeper in debt.
Nice metaphor.
I'm really better equipped to resolve issues that are emotionally crushing.
I'd say it's more of an engineering problem than a psychological one.
So, why are you depressed?
When you called, I assumed you we’re speaking metaphorically.
Can’t run away from your problems now, can you?
There’s a ton to talk about.
You say you're not sure what's weighing you down, but to me it's obvious.
It seems you're still having a little trouble keeping the weight off.
Well, it's usually a metaphor.
Let's start with a few deep breaths.
I warned you about pyramid schemes.
You feel like you're under a tremendous weight because you are under a tremendous weight."
Tell me about the first time you abused the word 'literally'.
I'm referring you to a crane.
I see we don’t have a ton of time left - Oh! Sorry! - my phrasing was insensitive.
Hmmm ...  is there something you want to get off your chest?
And you're sure there's nothing you'd like to get off your chest?
I find this technique useful when I discuss my fee.
I've never been more confident in diagnosing a depression.
Any pressing issues to discuss this week?
Sometimes a weight on your chest is JUST a weight on your chest.
What is your most pressing concern right now?
So when did the voices tell you that Newton was wrong?
You didn't need the prop, I understood the metaphor!
How long have you  had chest pain?
If it's nothing pressing, we'll wait till next time.
At the end of the day, of course, it’s you who will have to do the heavy lifting.
Well Brian, therapy can help, but you'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting.
What a coincidence, I’m going to bill you a ton too.
So, tell me, how long has this been weighing on you?

You're fired! Ha! Now who's the dummy?
We’re being downsized.
It’s not me!! It’s you!!
Here's your pink slip, dummy.
I didn’t say that, he did.
We quit!
You're being down sized.
We're getting downsized.
Go ahead, shoot the messenger.
Talk to the hand
It's a pink slip, dummy.
Read my lips: You're fired.
Sorry, but I'm just the messenger.
Here's my resume.
Don’t shoot the messenger.
I'm his mouthpiece!
Unfortunately we're downsizing.
We’re downsizing.
It's nothing personal.
Shoot the messenger.
#TreeToo.
Did you get the memo about downsizing?
#Mini-Me Too.
Read my lips.
Say hello to my little friend!
Plausible Deniability
Now whose the dummy?!?
You're fired, dummy!
No, you're the puppet.
You've been served.
Did you have a hand in this?
I think this speaks for itself.
He's blind and can throw his braille
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.
Yur ired
Hey! My eyes are down here!
What do I look like, a Dummy?!!!
From one dummy to another - you're fired!
Read my lips.......not his!!
Stop putting words in my mouth.
I'd like to file a sexual harassment complaint.
Read his lips: you’re fired.
He says, "You're fired."
Don't blame the messenger.
No! You're the dummy!
You’re fired.
Are you the dummy who wrote this?
I'm sorry, but we're downsizing.
Remember, you didn't hear it from me.
Read my lips: no new faxes.
Can you read shorthand?
You're so fired.
Every individual is at first a puppet; giving orders and a false ego, failing to see themselves and others as anything more. Only the eye of a simpleton can see the presence of the person hidden behind it.
I'm his right-hand man.
Who’s the dummy now?
You're fired but you didn't hear it from me.
Don't blame me. I'm just the messenger.
We have a little problem here.
I’m filing a formal complaint. I can’t seem to get this guy outta my business.
Here’s your pink slip. Who’s the dummy now?
This document speaks for itself.
This font is too big!
No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet.
Don't hit me, I'm just the messenger!
No dummy, you're fired!
It takes one to know one.
I've been downsized.
Y
Who are you calling 'Any dummy?'
I'm your new micro-manager.
What dummy wrote this?
You are flyered!
#metwo
There's no easy way to say this: we're downsizing.
This is our final offer - no strings attached!
Just remember.... you didn’t hear this from me.
My boss has really been up my ass about this.
You're fired! So who's the dummy now?
He's a rescue
Asking for a friend.
Sorry, you're being downsized ....
Speak for yourself.
You didn't hear this from me.
It's a Mini-Memo.

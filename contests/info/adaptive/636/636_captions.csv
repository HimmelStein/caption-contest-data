Yes, we all had the potato salad.  Why?
So all they told you was ‘the guy in the overalls?’
Whaddaya mean this is a “working lunch” for you?
Don't take it personally. We defy death pretty much every day.
I assume this is one of your easier assignments.
In that case, I'm gonna eat dessert first.
581 days without an accident, and then you show up.
Guess I'll go ahead and eat my dessert first.
If it helps you decide, the guy on the end is also a heavy smoker.
I knew a Jim Reaper back in Yonkers. Any relation?
Yes, I do realize the gravity of the situation.
Nope.  Nobody here by that name.
We're unionized.  You can't touch us.
Well of course we understand the gravity of our situation.
Any chance this is just a near-death experience?
Sure, we flirt with you. But we don’t really want you to show up at our worksite.
I'm gonna eat my dessert first today.
If I were afraid of you, would I be up here?
I take it, one of us is not working a full shift
What do you mean you're here for the earthquake?
So, the boys were wondering if it's business or pleasure.
So what does a "workforce redundancy consultant" actually do, anyway?
Yes, he was flirting with you. We all flirt with you every day.
The joke's on you.  We don't have graveyard shift up here.
The skeleton crew comes on at midnight
You know as well as I do, we can't discuss termination without my union rep present.
Funny, I always thought I'd meet you at the bottom
I always assumed a fall, but you’re telling me a chicken bone?
I hope this isn't a working lunch.
So, I guess I should eat dessert first today?
What do you mean by the 'company is downsizing'?
Honestly, we didn't think much of it until you showed up.
This is the day shift. You want the graveyard one.
Aren't you supposed to be on the graveyard shift?
‘Dying for a ham sandwich’ is a figure of speech.
Excuse me, you’re sitting in Joe's spot...Where’s Joe?
Let me guess...you're with HR?
Do I have time for lunch?
Reaper" ... that an Irish name?
Are you with HR?
The Saudi consulate?  That's over on Second Avenue.
Seriously, YOU'RE afraid of heights
Look down.  You just missed him.
So it's not the fall that kills you?
You must be from corporate.
So, just hypothetically, what happens if you fall?
Just killing time?
I guess for you we're the low-hanging fruit.
Was it something I ate?
Wouldn't it make more sense to wait for us at the bottom?
Don’t feel embarrassed. My first time up here I was scared to death.
Are you just enjoying the view or is this business?
Just a suggestion, but Charles, at the end, already has a cough.
You don’t scare me, I married your sister
I've got a bad feeling about the new guy.
Let’s just say, theoretically, if you were the one to fall . . .
What kind of name is Harbinger, is that German?
You're going to have to wait 'til after lunch. Union rules.
I hope you're on a break too.
We ordered eight box lunches. What do you mean “That’s not going to be a problem”?
Lunchtime is tools down, Kevin
Today’s my last day? Are you saying I’m fired?
Of course I can touch my toes.
You've got the wrong address - 666 Fifth's ten blocks down.
Just hanging out or here on business?
Look, you're gonna have to talk to the union rep if you want to pull one of us off the job.
Please tell me you're here for the view.
Breathtaking, isn’t it?
Union says I get the full half hour , Bud.
These all came from the same lunch truck, why do you ask?
We've been flirting with you for a long time.
It's the 1st time my wife made my lunch in 25 years, why do you ask?
If you’re free tonight, we’re having my mother-in-law over for dinner.
I thought you worked the graveyard shift?
You look scared to death.  First day on the job?
So you're saying I shouldn't worry about my  cholesterol?
Sorry, misunderstanding. It’s a wedding, not a funeral. The two guys on the end just got engaged.
Oh man, I haven't even used all my sick days yet
Admit it, you just hate the fact that we're defying you.
My wife forgot to put cheese in my sandwich.  Can this day get any worse?!
Well fellas, looks like it’s quittin’ time.
Aren't you on the graveyard shift?
No working during lunch break, buddy. Union rules.
OSHA will want a blade guard on that.
Well, we don't like to think of ourselves as low-hanging fruit.
What do you mean “downsizing”?
Wait, how long have you been waiting for Trump to pay you?
I sure hope you're on lunch break too.
Would it change anything if I told you there’s a brownie in here you can have?
C'mon, a couple of donuts never killed anybody.
Is this Lunch Time or Borrowed Time?
They want to know if you're still pissed-off about Capt. Sully and that thing on the Hudson.
No, I’m Fred. Bill is at the other end.
No...he called in sick today.
That would be Bob, at the far end.
Fagetaboutit!  If we was scared of death, we wouldn't be here.
You must be Trump's new administrator for Work Place Health & Safety.
Killer view, isn’t it?
You better look before you reap!
I take it you're working the graveyard shift?
He comes with all the Trump properties we build.
Our last meal is a box lunch?
Can’t you wait until the graveyard shift?
Not funny Lenny.
So your friend Taxes just skips developers?
Understandably, we would appear to be low hanging fruit.
Really makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?
It would probably be more efficient if you waited on the sidewalk.
To be honest, I would've expected to see you working the graveyard shift.
Guys, who forgot to tighten the hex nuts at the end of this I-beam?
Killer view, huh, mister?
So you're telling me I should go ahead and eat the extra cookie.
Bit early for the graveyard shift, Bub.
What brings you up here?
If you fall, do we live forever?
A view like this really makes you feel alive.
I assume you're not here for the view.
Does this mean no overtime today....?
Should I eat my dessert first?
Will you be discussing workplace safety?
Bob called in sick today, I can give you his address.
Please tell me you're on your lunch break, too
This wasn't the near death experience I was expecting when I took this job.
What if I just cut back on the fried chicken?
so, what brings you here?
Sorry if you feel double-crossed, but we cheat death everyday.
Isn't the view to die for?
Ya see... that's  just an expression. None of us actually cheated you out of anything.
You wouldn't know what happened to Eddie, would you?
So they laughed. So what? Look, don’t take it personally. They just laugh at death. That’s what they do.
You're early.
Would it kill you to take a vacation?
Don't drop that thing. You could kill somebody.
Look for drivers talking on cell phones maybe.
Do we get to choose between you and taxes?
Well this really is a near death experience!
Our graveyard shift starts at midnight.
Suddenly I'm afraid of heights"
Is this your first or last day here?
Union rules says you gotta put you're tools down durin'  lunch.
Don’t look at me—I packed a heart-healthy lunch.
Don't drop that thing - you could kill someone.
That was a great day for you when Trump killed the safety regulations.
The liverwurst is to die for, but then, you already knew that."
So what happens when YOU fall?
I don't suppose a nice PB&J would change your mind.
Local 666 sure is serious about collecting dues.
Yeah I like living on the edge, why?
You must have misunderstood. We were wondering when the rebar was going to arrive.
Sorry you had to come all the way up here.  The guy you're looking for just retired yesterday.
Stop flirting with death, Bill.
He's here to make sure we're in compliance with the new federal deregulations.
So, you’re the end of the line?
Don’t worry guys, he’s on his break too.
No, you misheard... they didn't say 'scythe scraper'
Obviously, if I were afraid of you, I wouldn't be here.
Going for the low-hanging fruit, Eh
Eat the Twinkie first? Is there something I should know?
No Frank. We never said we were all going to dress up.
Looks like the safety streak is over, boys!
Harry? He's not here today. Why?
Really? I've never heard of Local 666 before.
Still managing Trump Tower?
You’re late; Tom fell last week.
Uh, oh.  My mother-in-law packed my lunch today, didn't she?
It's a union job site. Nobody, including you, works on a lunch break.
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be on the G.E. Building.
Would helmets have made a difference?
And some potato salad from Saturday's picnic. Why?
We’re used to this. You’re the one who should be worried.
Hey, what do you mean I won't be needing this?
My lunch or my soul -- can I see what it is first?
I said bring the reefer—not the Reaper!
Kowalski?  Nah, there's no Kowalski here, right guys?
Well, we never really thought about it until now.
Philly cheesesteak with bacon and onion rings, like always. Why?
You can’t scare us buddy ..we laugh at death everyday!
You should eat something. You look like death warmed over.
I got a feeling a fake snake is gonna pop out of somebody's lunchbox again.
Hey, this is a union job; you can't make cuts without their permission.
You know, Trump Tower has a perch with a better view.
So, you're the new safety compliance guy?
Can I finish lunch first?  I brought a killer dessert!
So the beam’s not attached to anything...either end...that’s what you’re saying?
Don't tell me that this lousy box lunch is going to be my last meal.
Yeah, the view is to die for.
Surprised you took the foreman, but thanks!
It's kale. Do your worst.
You gotta eat man, you look like death.
Cheer up. After the Republicans end Obamacare you can go back to your full-time job.
Not if I push you first.
So ... you're in the deconstruction business?
So this the way the Donald is going to avoid paying us our back pay?
For God's sake, Alvin, it's just NOT funny!
Here Pete, take my lunch. Doesn't seem like I'll be needing it.
I ain’t fallin’ for it.
The guys want to finish lunch first if that's okay with you.
Sorry.   This is a union job.
Aye lad, you're a bit late.  We've all been dead for 50 years!
Can I finish my lunch first?
No you can't squeeze past!
Not funny Vinny.  Really not funny.
Wait until after we take the picture.
It's all about work-life balance.
What do you mean, I won't need my lunch?
We're union. Join or die.
If OSHA catches you up here, you’re dead.
I don't care if today is Halloween.  It's still in very bad taste.
Dying of hunger is just a figure of speech.
Dude, this picture is over 80 years old---we're already dead!
Are  you looking for someone in particular? ...or will anyone do?
What do you mean we don't have time for lunch?
Oh, you're looking for Karl. He works in corporate and eats lots of trans fats.
Nice try... I'm still not joining the union.
Of course, none of us makes a living wage.
We know it's dangerous - do you have to rub it in?
If you look closely you can see my mother-in-law's apartment from here.
It is last week's meatloaf, why do you ask?
You're from accounting?
Who told you that you could make
 a killing in construction?
It's life or death up here every day, what's your point?
Killer lunch spot.
And what if I say I don't want to share?
OSHA wont like this.
You must be the new guy. Any idea what happened to Frank?
You better not drop that thing.  It could kill somebody.
So what do you mean that Artie doesn’t have to worry about not having a lunch box.
Aren't you the rep from the company's health benefits provider?
The guys want to know if work brings you here or just the view?
So are you ever like, a harbinger of GOOD news?
Sorry, no work during lunch—union rules.
Ya, it's good, but not to die for.
I know ‘No man knoweth the hour.’ But does it have to be the lunch hour?
It's her cooking that gets me in the end, isn't it?
"It sure beats working the graveyard shift."
Did Trump stiff you too?
I said "to go" but I didn't mean it metaphorically.
Do we have enough time for dessert?
No, not me...I've got seniority.
Cheer up. Without YOU we’d never stop paying taxes.
According to union rules, we get an uninterrupted lunch. Come back in a couple hours.
Killer costume Joe.
Uh, fellas, can someone please double-check the rivets?
Go ahead, jump. What's the worst that could happen?
I'll trade you a ham sandwich for an extenstion.
When discussing the season we prefer 'autumn' instead of 'fall.'
I guess we didn't pass the safety inspection.
You look like more of a demolition kind of guy.
Fellas - meet the new guy!  He says he's from upper management.
Don't drop that thing.  You might kill somebody.
Well now we're thinking about it.
I know how you feel. I was scared to death the first time, too.”
You ain't doin' wonders for morale, bub.
You know nobody likes you, right?
Yeah...I agree...Trump is awesome for getting rid of all those safety regulations.
Nice fall weather we're having.
Yeah... that's where Jerry used to sit.
Mr. Bannon, Donald's office is three floors down.
Hey Joe, did you check those rivets before lunch, like I asked you to?
The view is to die for!
Look, mister, I know you got a job to do. But union rules are union rules!
Hey, I told you before, if OSHA catches you up here with that hand tool, we're all dead!
You can take my lunch over my dead body.
It makes the other guys nervous when you come up here without lunch.
How's my afternoon lookin?
I don't mean to tell you your business, but shouldn't you be waiting on the ground
You'll make your monthly quota in one day.
It’s unanimous, next time wear the Spiderman Costume.”
You're here for the safety training, right?
You're way cooler than our old safety rep.
So, what exactly does a 'grim-riveter'  do?
When I told my wife I’d kill myself if she packed me another bologna sandwich, I was just kidding around. I swear!
Have you seen Jimmy? He was just sitting here…
You’ll be fine - just don’t look up.
Okay, but can you take our photo first?
You're non-union, then?
Sorry but the job is for a Grim Roofer!
I swear ' I'm about to die of starvation'  was just a figure of speech .
OSHA is really gonna hate that scythe.
Hell's Kitchen is six stories below.
Okay, but you go first.
You know, your job kinda takes care of itself up here.
So if you fell from here, what would happen?
How about I give you my lunch instead?
Which one of you ordered from Chipotle?
What happens if I don't give you my cookie?
OK, let me ask you this: what if we all put our hard hats on?
Yes, I would choose my wife's home-made sandwich for my last meal.  Why do you ask?
Somehow, I think lunch hour may be over.
None of us are falling for that, pal.
The company has great insurance , why?
Don't even think about it, today's payday!
So let me guess. I choke on my sandwich?
You're killing my appetite.
Do you mind scooting down a little?  You’re killing my appetite.
Is it quittin' time already?
You go low, we go high.
Hey, where'd Frank go?
I suppose you can make a killing at this job, why do you ask?
Why so grim?
P B & J for our last meal?  Really?
Whaddya mean, you know a faster way down?
The guys tell me you're just a harmless cliché.
You want my what?
I hope you all remembered to clock out.
This isn't death row.
Uh, define 'trick or treat'?
This does not bode well for the rest of the shift.
Looking for someone?
When I'm up here I feel so alive.
Do I have time to finish my lunch?
Start spreadin' the news...Someone's leavin' today.
Do you seriously think you’ll scare these guys?
So what happens if you fall?
Normally, I'd be afraid of you, but look where I work.
Any idea where Artie went?
I know it's Halloween, Ed, but that costume is really bad for morale.
Just don’t look up and you’ll be fine.
"No.  But I do have a fear of depths."
Just for kicks, is it the food, or the fall?
I don't know, he just sat down and asked if I was ticklish.
Did someone file a grievance with the union?
Shouldn't you be waiting at ground level?
The guy on the end is an investment banker.
Sorry. Phil called in sick. Maybe Dave can help you. He's pretty clumsy.
Time to knock off yet?
The guys want to know if you could wait till after the photo is taken?
Look who’s scared now.
So you’re saying this isn’t a good spot for lunch?
When I said my wife's rigatoni was to die for, I didn't mean it literally.
Is that a sky scraper?
It's beginning to feel like a near death experience.
I don’t care what women say, scythe does matter!
We usually do a couple of pirouettes and get back to work. Why do you ask?
So you're afraid of heights - what's the worst that could happen?
You’ll be fine. Just don’t look down.”
Hope you’re taking a lunch break.
I mean, we're all temps am I right?
Back so soon?
You're taking this Halloween thing way too seriously,Jerry
You missed him by 10 minutes.
I never thought I'd be talking the Grim Reaper off a ledge...
I thought it was strange that my wife offered to pack my lunch this morning...
Are you the union representative about health care?
You don't scare me. You know what scares me? Spiders scare me.
Would you like a Life Saver?
Hey, do you know where Mark went?
So, eeny meeny miney mo?
Any chance you could come back after lunch?
Sorry, pal, I'm not falling for it.
You're always so damned negative.
I'll give you my dessert if you take Carl instead of me.
I thought we were getting killed by the trade deficit.
So the guys and I agree, you should probably look down.
Wow!  I haven't seen YOU around since last fall!
Could you sit somewhere else?
So, I heard you made a killing on Wall Street. What brings you... here?
I assume Joey isn’t coming for lunch.
You could have just put a pink slip in our pay envelopes
What do you mean we're being scheduled for the graveyard shift?
The view up here is to die for, no?
If I give you my lunch, can you take Tony instead?
So you took this job because it was too perilous being in Donald Trump's cabinet?
Of course we all defy you.
Before lunch? Really?
Shouldn't you be waiting down there?
Want me to pass on a message?
You look familiar, buddy, were you here yesterday when Al slipped?
Just so you know our lunch is organic and we're wearing sunscreen. We're not as reckless as you think.
Which one of you ordered lunch to go?
No, I didn't forward that email to 20 people...
Ok I’ll help you pick , let’s do rock, paper, scythe.
No, we are not building a scythescraper.
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say ‘no thanks’
Do you mind if I finish my lunch first?
Uh, you can’t be here if you’re not Local 83
Talk about a Dead End job.
How about if we started wearing hardhats?
May I borrow your can opener?
Sorry, you just missed him; do you want his lunch?
Hey, buddy, would you mind taking a picture of all of us?
Is there something we should know about the box lunch?
Man, I really wasn’t scared of heights until today.
The guys wanna know when you're gonna stop hanging out here.
Ok then, how about an apple AND a Twinkie?
Knocking off early today?
Nice costume, Gene.  Inappropriate as hell, but very convincing.
Who knew!? Jerry's got a peanut allergy.
I've faced death before and it doesn't look anything like you.
Don't drop that. You might kill someone.
Is that for balance?
Can it wait until after lunch?
They are asking if you could wait until after lunch
So how do I die, falling off the girder or the pastrami on rye?
Okay, who checked the support rivets?
Hey, careful - you could kill somebody with that thing.
Death wish? What do you mean by that?
It’s only scary if you look down.
Do you know something that we don't?
You should eat something, you look like death
I'm guessing you're not with the Union?
oh, you must be mistaken...I'm Joey Smith. Joe Smith is third down from me.
I really think you'll find a hammer more useful for this project
I'm not sure I like this new, 'Death is just a step away' OSHA campaign.
So now you see why we do not fear you.
Work or holiday?
Sorry, pal, they already killed the union.
Don’t worry.  Business will pick up for you when the new Trump health and safety policies kick in.
Can you at least wait until our break is over?
I have a feeling you’re not telling us everything.
If I had known this would be my last meal, I wouldn't have packed the egg salad.
It's a dead-end job anyway.
No lunch?  You must be starving to death.
It's a living.
Can't help you pal. Bob called in sick today.
Would you mind sitting somewhere else?
Would it hurt your feelings if I moved to the other end?
Have a donut, already...you look like death
Like my mom always said, you should have thought about that before you came up here.
Is there something we should know about these box lunches?
I know this may be particularly hard for you but you just cannot think about death if you are going to work up here.
We have to stop saying "starving to death" before lunch.
I never heard of work-death balance.
You can’t take any of us — we’re protected by the Union.
No offense, but I kind of wish you were sitting at the other end.
I can't speak for them but you don't scare me. I was married to your sister...
Would it kill you to bring your own lunch for once?
My wife packed deep-fried pork rinds and a bacon sandwich, again.  Why do you ask?
You first.
I forgot my sandwiches. How could this day get any worse.
Say, Louie was wondering. Could you grab his lunchbox when you go down to get the guy it landed on?
I've never believed in near Death experiences until now....
So, are you from OSHA?
Thanks for going to all this trouble, but I think you're looking for the other Billy Padget. He's on the 42nd Street crane.
Now that i think of it maybe we should have worn the safety harnesses.
Shrimp salad. Why?
Well, at least you're not waiting at the bottom.
Could I have lunch first?
If it were up to me I'd say 'hell yeah, you can be in the photo', but the guys think you're a bit of a downer.
Would you like a deviled egg?
so you're the fall guy they keep talking about?
Don't look down. Keep your eyes straight ahead. And what ever you do, don't drop the scythe.
So what do you think? Killer view?
OK, HALF a salami on rye AND a pickle. Final offer.
Is this about work/ life balance?
Frank, some of the guys and I wanted to talk to you about your choice of Halloween costume.
Lemme guess, you're not a union guy?
So, are you here because I'm dangerously high, or because my cholesterol is?
Union rules allows overalls or white shirts but not hoodies
Sorry, he fell off yesterday!
Could I bribe you with a couple of deviled eggs?"
Hey, wait a minute. WHERE'S FRED? WHERE'S FRED?
Isn't the last meal supposed to be dinner?
Can I at least finish my lunch?
If push comes to shove, you can eat mine.
Not feeling quite so confident up here, are ya?!
You gotta stop thinkin' like it's still 1933, Grim--what with the opioid crisis, hurricanes, Middle-East mayhem, and white cops shooting black men willy-nilly, you can get bodies a lot faster than hangin' around the likes of us, let me tell ya.
I'll give you my lunch if you move to the other end.
Look, no offense, but we told the boss there's a better way to do lay offs.
Gives you a perspective , doesn't it?
Yeah, I know that fatty lunch meat and cholesterol aren’t good for your heart. Why do you ask?
You sure?  It's Death by Chocolate....
Halloween or not, we don’t think that’s funny, Charlie!
You sure you're with the union?
Please tell me that is a Halloween costume.
Sam?  I dunno, he was just here
It's a little late now to pick our last meals, right?
Yeah, whatever dude; all my lunch breaks are near-death experiences."
Do you know something we don't know??
This is starting to feel a little unsafe.
...and so I says to him, "Hey pal,it's your funeral!
What do you mean you've come for our collective bargaining rights?
You're with OSHA, right?
Can you take a raincheck? I peeked at what my wife packed for me, and it’s not exactly ‘last-meal-worthy’....
I take it 
you're not eating?
The guy on the end is also a heavy smoker.
I don't care, show me your union card.
Yeah, I might have said the Russ & Daughter's lox is to die for - what of it?
Hey, where did Hank go?
So life literally depends on a sense of balance?
Borrow your can opener?
For someone who's never been unemployed, you look pretty stressed.
Just playin' the odds, eh?
Do you want some lunch, or will we be departing soon?
I assume asking for overtime is out of the question.
Don't look down and you'll be fine.
Sorry buddy—can't do nothing without a union card.
“Where’ve you been?  Haven’t seen you since last fall.”
OK, but if I give you a sandwich, I want to see where it goes when you swallow it.
Well, I guess this is the end of the line.
Would you mind taking a photo of us?
If ya spit on a guy from this height, it'll go right thru his skull....just a suggestion.
Now you're just getting lazy.
Joe, you're not scaring anybody. Bring your own damn lunch.
Transfat? Seriously?
Which is it, a fall, or my wife's food?
Any chance I can finish my lunch?
I thought my tuna lunch would be the worst part of my day.
What'd ya mean I won't have time for my cupcake?
It's actually not the fall that kills you...
You must be the new Efficiency Expert.
You sure this is peanut free?
No, I won't move over.
Is it lunchtime or our last supper ?
Rob here has high cholesterol.
The boys and I were just wondering if you're visiting us or taking your break?"
As a matter of fact, we were the low bid.  What’s it to ya?
Wages of sin? Is that Union scale?
You look like death today, Rodney.
Hey guys....I'm thinkin the tuna salad might be bad.
Technically speaking, shouldn't you be at the bottom?
Is it the fall or my lunch that does it?
So, do you come here often?
How can you be so grim with this killer view?
Sure, my wife made my lunch. Why do you ask?
Isn't most of your work at ground level?
I suppose Taxes is afraid of heights.
Are you OK with heights? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Do you mind if we just take a quick photo first?
Are we going to play this out, or should I just jump already?
Riveting costume, dude!
Can we finish our lunch first?
I don’t suppose that thing is for spreading mustard.
I’m ready now...she packed leftovers.
I know it's Halloween, but it really creeps the guys out when you wear that to work.
Who the hell are you and what have you done with Larry?
You're gonna kill the photo.
No, I didn't check the weather, why?
Can you give us fifteen minutes - Sam just brought up gyros.
When I said the view is to die for, I didn't think there'd be a follow up at work.
Don’t worry, after a few weeks you’ll get over the fear that death is a constant companion.
How does that thing fit in your tool belt?
I don't care who you are or why you're here, if you don't have a Union card you can't work
I can't put my finger on it, but this new guy makes me a little nervous."
The trick is not to look down.
I’m pretty sure this is not a construction scythe.
I think jumping would be redundant.
It's a long way down, but I guess you already know that.
The first clue? You didn't pack a lunch.
It's really nice of you to come to the reunion."
We've seen you around here before, okay? You don't impress this crowd.
Wouldn't it make more sense for you to be down there
If you're lookin' to double your quota,the couple at the end will go hand-in-hand.
I'll trade ya two Ring Dings for an extra week, take it or leave it.
Real funny, Mike, but they'll crop you out.
Can you at least let me choke on my lunch?
They work you to death?
Hey Frank, the new guy is freaking me out a little.
Well, I'll be. Always thought we wouldn't meet until the ground floor.
Look.  I know we cheat you every day of the week.  
But don't take it so hard.  Want a bite to eat?
Final offer: ham and swiss for another five years.
Hey Larry, this guy says it's your last day on the job unless you give him your sandwich.
Can we at least finish our lunch break?
OK. As long as you're not from OSHA.
if she packed me liverwurst again then yeah, i'll go first.
Man, I'm glad I don't have your job.
You'll make friends - it just takes the guys a while to trust someone new.
What do you know that we don't know
Um, no, its Bill.  You must be looking for my twin brother Will.
What do you mean "look down?"
You're too late. The unions died years ago.
No, I'm not afraid of falling. I'm afraid of hitting the ground."
I thought the egg salad tasted off.
"You said you're with New York Life?
Bad day for my wife to have packed Death by Chocolate cake.
Take Carl, he dropped his lunch.
It's the mayonnaise I used, isn't it?
Why the sad face? No lunch?
'I'll go out on a limb here and say that you're the new health and safety guy?'
While you're here, could you cut the crust off my sandwich?
It's not the fall that kills you; it's the sudden stop at the end.
Guys, you might want to stay away from the tuna salad.
Hold up on that egg salad, guys. I don't trust this delivery man.
Come here often?
Fall harvest?
Gary, Halloween isn't til Wednesday.
so where do we go from here ?
OSHA isn't going to like this.
It's not a Trump building.
I get that you're playing the odds, but it's not great for morale.
Seating can be challenging, but the views are to die for.
Hey! What happened to Larry?
Think about it, where's the challenge?
Hades? We thought we were building a bridge to Brooklyn!
So you went with the high deductible plan?
So I said, "Dolores, your egg salad is going to kill me!
The least you can do is let us finish our lunch.
Eh, excuse me mister, did you see that guy who was sitting here?
Wouldn't it be ironic if you were here for the guy sketching us?
I see they've gotten around to deregulating OSHA.
Why the grim face? It's lunchtime!
How come the skeleton crew guys never bring your own lunch?
Does this mean we're fired?
My wife's lunch scares me more than you do.
Are you Trump's OSHA chief?
I know you're the only one who volunteered for Health & Safety rep, but it seems like a conflict of interest.
You're here about the processed meat, aren't you?
And if I don't share my sandwich?
Can we at least finish lunch before you go to work?
You know, you're kind of putting a damper on lunch.
Whad’ya mean by “move over”?
Well, for dessert, I have “Death By Chocolate”.
What do you mean by us cheating you?
Can this wait until after my Reuben?
Deviled Egg?
Don't look so grim, rookie. You can have half my sandwich.
I think I've seen you here before.
You drop that thing from up here and someone's gonna die...
Can it wait until after lunch, I packed a pudding cup today.
What do you mean, you'll be finishing my lunch today?  Why would I give you my lunch?
Would that be individually or collectively?
This isn't what I thought our union contract means by "death benefits".
Are you here to work or just for the view?
Tools aren't allowed on lunch break beam.
Can you settle a bet? Carbs or fat?
Boss, I hope this is your idea of a Halloween joke.
Hmmm, let me guess - you’re the Saudi Embassy!
Hey Fred!  He says he can see your house from up here.
I guess workers comp is also off the table!
Glen, wearing that costume every day won't convince management to give us safety helmets.
So ... just what are the odds?
It's OK -- we were all nervous at first, too...
The guy you're looking for isn't up here anymore.
My wife always said this was a dead-end job, but I didn't think she meant it literally.
This is about a lifetime of bologna sandwiches, isn't it?
The Yankees will be back next year. Don't look so grim.
Yeah we should've told ya', we don't usually dress up for Halloween around here."
"Forget it.  Up here, the scythe's the limit.
What do you mean?  I've never seen fish in a barrel.
Gee, I never thought you would have a fear of heights.
Well,my appetite is gone.
No, I didn't really mean it when I said this sandwich will be the death of me.
Guys, maybe we shoulda worn our hard hats.
Now that I think about it, the tuna did taste a bit off.
Can you wait 'til after lunch?
Real subtle
Now I am afraid.
I guess I know what happened to the new guy.
You kn ow, you're really hurting morale up here.
I think you're in the wrong cartoon...
Salmonella - well ain't that ironic?
I’m hoping your on your lunch break
Halloween, right?
You're not getting my cookie even if it's the last thing I do
Could you wait till they're done taking the picture?
YOU'RE the new rep from OSHA?
You should call out tomorrow Buddy, you look like death
Dude, Halloween's tomorrow
Aren't you late for the next session of Congress?
You come here often?
So this is less scary than being a middle school teacher?
I think you belong on the other end
Are you on the clock?
Um, you do know that's a fake backdrop, right?
Okay, how about the ham on rye AND the cookie?
If you take the day off, there's half a Twinkie in it for ya.
And what do YOU do for a living?
Yeah, we DO have a tap dance routine. How'd you know?
After my lunch, okay?
Never entered my mind that it would be foodborne.
Anderson? How do you like that, he called in sick!
Hey pal, Ed wants to borrow your bottle opener.
Yeah, I know the Reapers. Non-union crowd.
Are you here about the girder or the spam sandwiches?
What exactly do you mean by "can You scoot over to the right a bit?"
People get hit by busses too you know.
Don’t worry, I’m on break also.
So what do we get if we DO join the union?
Well...my wife did say she'd kill me if I lost my lunch box again.
You don't happen to know what time it is?
Hey! Where’s Ralph?
Is that the new iScythe?
I don't suppose you take requests?
Halloween or not — we told you it’s just not funny!
No offense, but I'm gettin' sick of seeing your face every day.
So you're the reason my premiums increased.
Have you seen Frank?
Could I borrow your knife ? "
"This is about my late union dues isn't it
The keto diet really seems to be working Dave.
So I can have the bacon?
I’m guessing you didn’t bring lunch.
A strange way to tell us our break is over.
It helps if you don't look down.
I never would have figured you for a vegetarian.
Not you again!
I'm not sure the union should let you vote on our health care options...
Do you mind sitting on the other side?
Do I have time to eat before the fall, or is it the lunch that kills me?
Yeah we know, the view's breathtaking.
Nice to meet you. Shake hands with my buddy Joe
I TOLD you not to look down.
I’m not saying you can’t be here but OSHA will go nuts.
You seriously think I need more fear?
What's wrong, Death? Feelin' a little queasy?
Quit being so dramatic, Joe. Your sandwich is coming.
You all sticking around for the graveyard shift?
Deviled eggs and crab salad from the employee picnic Saturday.
What have you got?
My wife packs my lunch, why?
Couldn’t you wait till after lunch?
You're not from OSHA, are you
You the union buster they told me about?
We like living on the edge.
If it would help, I could leave a few banana peels around.
Fall views are my favourite.
Sorry, Ed’s home sick.
I thought you were off today.
If you don't have a union card,get the hell off.
At least he's not from OSHA.
Yea. This “gig” economy has everybody working outside their specialty.
How about we all come back in 50 years to shoot this same photo again?
It's dessert. Death by Chocolate.
Halloween’s Wednesday, Joe.
Would you settle for half of my baloney sandwich?
You might have better luck during Happy Hour.
Union rules. No working lunches.
Step out there and tell him yourself!
It's the bologna isn't it?
So the guy your looking for just stepped away.
My wife said she packed me a killer sandwich.
Ok, so I should cut back on the salt and fried foods, and eat healthier. What makes you the expert?
Where's  Ernie?
Well, if you must know, we're taking a lunch break from defying you.
A first!  Her mother made me lunch today . . . Why?
So... what are the benefits like?
No, no, no. The bell tolls for TEA. 
We negotiated hard for this break!
Well, I guess it okay for YOU to look down....
Terrific. On the day I get something besides PB&J.
Can you come back after the photo shoot?
Sorry buddy, it'll have to go - site rules say no sharp objects
What line of work are you in?
No, I'm not interested in insurance.
I'm sorry, but you're starting to make the other workers nervous.
Never figured you to be scared of heights
What did you say you do for a living?
Hey, don't look so grim.
I told you, Bill called in sick today.  What can I help you with?
How did Mr. Giuliani get all the way up here!?
Are you on your lunch break, too?
You afraid of heights? You look like death.
...And you get to reap great union benefits!
You have to be in the union to be up here.
What do you mean this lunch is to die for.
But we weren't going to call it the 13th floor!
Would you mind taking our picture?
Relax, Mort.  Heights used to scare me to death, too.
You been here before?
Haven't you been here before?
But not all of us ate the cream puffs!
Yeah, it's a great view but don't you have someplace else to be?
Are you Union?
But I have been eating this kale salad every day.
Would you mind going back down to get the napkins?
Eddie didn’t come to work today.
You from the union?
You’re on break too then, huh? That makes me feel safer up here I guess.
You're not alone, a lot of us scaffolding guys have side hustles.
Mind if we do this after lunch?
Looks like someone is scared to death of heights.
My God Fred, you look like death warmed over.
Hey wait a minute- didn’t there used to be 11 of us?
That's right. You can't work here without a union card.
Yes, you can see Yankee Stadium from here, why do you ask?
Crab cakes. Why do you ask?
I think he fell off the beam last week at lunch, but let me ask the guys, ok?
Somehow I don’t think this one is a team player.
You mind if I borrow that? I forgot my fork.
It's easier if you don't look down.
[I'm sorry, Mr./Ms/ Editor, but this picture is perfect without any caption.]
So how long have you been working at OSHA?
How in the Hell did you get up here?
I've got tuna again. Let me guess. You've got Death By Chocolate, again.
Are you scythe seeing?
So you're going to strike, right?
This job will be the death of me
Shouldn't you be with the landscaping crew?
Would you mind taking a picture of the rest of us?
At least I won't have to pay back my student debt.
Sometimes it feels like you're hanging on for dear life.
He's non-union.
You sticking around until we knock off?
Can you wait until we've finished lunch?
It's usually more metaphorical.
I get half an hour for lunch. Union rules.
Can I at least eat first?
I hope your're here for that "no-carb" jerk.
Say pal, would you mind sitting at the other end.
Can I trade my liverwurst sandwich for a decent last meal
A little dramatic, Frank?
Would you like to go first?
Oh, so you knew Vinny?
You'll eventually meet everyone up here.
You'd best come back on a windy day.
Look down.
Would a pastrami hoagie change your mind?
I’m thinking maybe that last bolt needs to be little tighter
Don't be nervous. After all, the fall can't kill you.
It’s bad pastrami isn’t it?
Wrong building dude. We all follow safety procedures.
Eat some lunch Joey, you look like death warmed over
You look scared.
Yeah, we were all scared too when we started. Just don't look down.
Be careful, this thing is a death trap
Haven't I seen you up here before?
Any idea who it's gonna be?
I don’t believe I actually describe the work as death “defying.“
You came for me.  I'm not going to help you down.
Death threats won't stop them from cropping you out of the photo."
Look, pal, I'm just saying that thing's no good for this particular job.
You don't mind sliding forward a few inches, do you?
Hey fella's, this guy says he's taking one of us off this job. Hope it's me.
Y'know Frank, this gag is started to get pretty old.
No you’re fine. This is just where I come to think.
Are you here for the photo?
Bill, are you ok? You’re looking a little grim.
What took you so long?
Grim "rebar"
Can't I just finish my break first?
But I am eating healthier.
Hank, you look like death warmed over, maybe you should knock-off early today.
Our union allows us collective bargaining.
So it's OK to finish our lunch?
Can I finish my cheesecake first?
Sorry, we got a Shaun, a Brendan, and a Niall O'Hara, but no John.
It's a union rule: no tool use durin' lunch.
We're all vegan.  The ham sammie with nitrates boys are on the next beam up.
I knew Jerry didn't tighten that screw in all the way.
If you're here for lunch, the guy on the end usually has the best one.
So you knew Bill from your last job?
This dude lost his health care because, in his case, death was ruled a pre-existing condition.
Hey, where’s Jimmy?
not as easy as it looks, is it?
You get used to it.
No wiggle room on that OSHA inspection, I guess."
We'd all be a lot more comfortable if you'd go with another costume this Halloween.
If you're not in the Union, you should't be here.
Hey,aren't you on the night shift ?
Is it too late to vote for the union?
You better be union, buddy!
Is it the food, the fall, the wife, or global warming? Tells us already, the suspense is killing me.
Would half a delicious baloney sandwich change your mind?
Scoot to the left, unless you want to be in the picture.
Yeah, let's see you do it without the pole, hot shot.
So, new guy. You play hockey or somethin'?
You're too late, Kevin jumped this morning
I think the plan called for a dome, not doom.
You take 5th over to Broadway, turn left and the project you want is 2 blocks down.
No, I said we WEREN'T dressing up this year.
No, Fred's working clear over on the other side. Just go down this beam, take a right on that long plank, then up the cross-bracing a couple stories.
Do you know something I don't?
Our sandwiches are already sliced.
Can you wait until I've finished my lunch?
Pickle?
Really? It's the unrefridgerated mayo that gets me?
Sitting is the new smoking.
Should we eat lunch first?
I know it’s Trump Tower, but we have to work there.
I'll give you my cookies.
Hey, Buddy! That tool you're carrying is an OSHA violation.
Not my idea of a skeleton crew.
Well, he said this sandwich was to die for.
You're pretty much overkill up here, buddy.
Too late. This job crushed our souls long ago. We eat out here to just to feel alive.
'Hey you got any Lifesavers?'
This why we need to unionize.
At least I won't have to face another baloney sandwich.
Are you here to replace the missing safety harnesses?
Looks like someone's behind on their union dues.
Tuna fish again?!  Bro, just take me now.
What do you mean you’re afraid of heights?
It's about time, we've been up here for 85 years!
Just passing through?
Come to think of it, I am starting to feel a breeze.
Death becomes you, Andy.
You need to stop sliding to the right.
Sorry, but my saying that Joe's pastrami sandwiches are to die for is just a figure of speech.
Listen Pal if I go you're comin' with me!
That's not fair, you know the maximum safe occupancy of this girder is 8.
Even death has to take a lunch break.
I've got a Toro mower that can beat the crap out of that thing.
Just my luck...deviled eggs.
So Frankie wants to know, just what do you mean by "It sure don't get better than this!".
You scared the life out of me, but then I realized you're on your lunch break."
I see that you forgot to bring a lunch. Perhaps we can come to an arrangement?
Listen, buddy, I don't care who you are. I'm the union rep of Ironworkers Local 580, and I say get off now.
Sick Halloween costume, bro.
Don't worry, you'll get used to staring death in the face.
Time to knock off for lunch.
C'mon, don't you ever take a break?
We've all been there. You'll be okay.
Cut it out, Herbie.  It isn't funny.
That's a pretty twisted Halloween costume, Frank."
If I knew you were coming I wouldn't have leftover chicken parm, I can tell you that.
Okay. I'll give you a treat, but that means there'll be no trick. Okay?
So, you're the new health and safety officer?
Even Death is living on the edge.
It's not gonna happen on our lunch hour, pal.
Are you taking us all at once, or one at a time?
Don't be such a downer
I  quit.
You could put an eye out...
So, I take it the deadline is up in the air.
Making Hell Great Again!
We expected you weeks ago.
If I were to put my finger on it, I’d say the guys think you’re a bit of a downer.”
Okay, okay, I'll lay off the carbs.
Yeah, we like it because on a clear day you can see forever!
You are lost, the Giants don't actually play in New York.
Oh, It's just you; I thought it was the OSHA inspector!
Does this smell old to you?
It's a dying craft
Haven't we seen you here before?
I assume you'll let us finish lunch before you make your choice?
Excuse me, who did you say you are here to see?
Please stop bouncing until we've finished lunch...
What did you mean when you said: May I have your lunch, you won't be needing it today, or anytime thereafter?
Hold still, I'm going to squeeze by you.
I gotta be honest, I liked you better before the accident, Gary
EENY, MEENY,  MINEY, MOE?????
Can you come back after lunch?
What? You have to use the bathroom?
Would you like some mortadella?
Hey, stop pushing!
It's a good job. Nobody jumps.
Oh, none of you are going to fall. I'm here for your healthcare and fringe benefits.
Look, we all agree it would make a terrific workplace safety poster, but he said he won’t take the picture until you’re out of shot.
Here, you can have my Reuben sandwich. It would have killed me anyway.
Don’t look down.
Tell me again. Where exactly are we going?
I hear they’re hiring on the skeleton shift.
It’s better than dying of boredom at an office job.
Look.  There's no safety net for you either, ya know.
No, Jake isn't here right now.  Can I take a message?
Egg white salad again?! Okay, I'm ready.
Not funny George !
You scared of heights or somethin'? You look like death.
. . .and then my wife goes, ‘’whad’ya have a death wish!’
Bob, it was was funny two years ago, even last year, but now the costume's just cliché.
Must be a lot of overtime in your line of work.
Say, how come you're not manspreading?
Have you registered to vote?
Want my lunch?  All of a sudden I’m not hungry.
Man, I don't recommend swinging that thing up here without wearing your safety belt.
Let me finish my sandwich first.
Is this in honor of those bolts I forgot to tighten?
I think the new guy's got some kind of death wish.
You unionized?
As you can see, none of us have a foot in the grave.
725 Fifth Avenue... why do you ask?
These cannoli are to-die-for!
We appreciate the box lunches.  But, as union rep, the scythe is really an accident waiting to happen."
Sorry, I 'm Billy Jones. Frank is on the 35th floor.
*Gulp* So are you on your lunch break, too..?
Just don't look down.
Wait, you got Joey and now you want my apple too?
Hey, the guys have a bet. Which lunch looks most like death warmed over?
So you're the new guy from OSHA?
We were doing Village People for Halloween, not Dead Poets Society.
What do you mean, "Just in case"?
Is it the fall or the processed meat?
Here, take my lunch.  You look like you could use it.
And to think they called us death-defying.
You’ll have to do better than that to get a rise out of these guys
How's about you take the killer hoagie I packed today and we call it even?
You one of those union busters?
Was it the salmon mousse?
You should really eat something, Greg. You're skin and bones.
Maybe I shouldn't eat the meatloaf."
Jerry, the Halloween party is tomorrow.
Heights scare you to death?
I thought you worked the swing shift...
While you haven't  yet crossed the line between passive aggressive and disturbing, Harold, you're right up against it.
Of course we miss having you on the crew, but since the accident you're just way too creepy.
So, what do you think about a single-payer system?
Aww geez, why don’t you sit next to Morty down there, his tuna sandwich has been sitting in the sun for hours!
Didn't I see you at the Giants game?
Which seven??
Al, Sam, get a load of the new guy's safety hook.
You can watch.  But no pushing.
Second from the end...and...he’s  wearing new boots today!
Are you expecting some wind?
We assumed you were going low, so we went high.
If you fell off, does that mean we wouldn't die?
Ok, Dan, we get it, it isn’t OSHA compliant!
I can´t believe they pulled you out of retirement too.
You are all making my job too easy.
Oh *^$#!
So your the temp....just for today?
My wife packs me the same lunch every day! Please take me.
How about a piece of my wife's 'Death By Chocolate' cake?
My tunafish is bad, isn't it?
Sorry, we are on break.
Buddy, can you spare some time?
Which union did you say you're with?
Yeah, the union offers life insurance.
That’s what he gets for eating gas station sushi.
I'd kill for a hot lunch. How 'bout you?
Did you hear what happened to Bill, that guy you were sitting next to yesterday?
You're not union, are you?
We get that eating lunch on this beam is dangerous Phil, but do you really have to wear that costume everyday
So the contract negotiations aren't going too well . . . ?
Hey Reep!  Tell us about that deal you made with Trump again
It's the mayonnaise in our tuna salad, isn't it.
Hey pal, it's lunch time so take a break already.
You must be new at this, nothing much happens during lunch.
I really hope my wife packed LifeSavers.
My wife's salami and cheese is to die for if you'd like some.
We’d all feel a lot safer if you could just leave the scyth at home
Guys, it looks like we we’re not gonna  worry about heartburn today,,,
Pick one of us, I can't stand the suspense any longer.
Try as you may, you can't kill this iconic American image.
The new guy seems depressed.
Does that thing really help you balance?
It's really dangerous up here. You must have a death wish, too.
"What do you mean, 'gesundheit'?
The view up here is just to die for!
I'm not going nowhere without my crew.
Would you like a piece of my wife's upside-down cake?  It's to die for.
relax, everybody's afraid of heights the first time
Oh, now, Twinkies aren't really that bad for you.
Oh, sh*t!
I don’t care, Jerry. I’m going to eat the brisket.
In our line of work, we always knew there'd be a chance you might stop by; just not during the lunch break.
Check out the guy on the end. He refuses to eat kale.
Hey buddy, that thing looks dangerous!
Hey new guy, what happened to Jim?
So your fear is heights, huh?
Sorry, I'm sharing mine with Bill here. He's still got something to live for.
We drew straws and I lost.  You need to use deodorant.
Just let me eat my hoagie first.
Naw..... you're in the wrong place.   We work here.
You wanna go over to the GW Bridge.  People take a dive everyday.  You'll make a killing over there."
It's not as scary, if you don't look down
I can't believe Donald Trump fired you too
Very funny, now go take the picture.
Can you cut our sandwich in half?
Can it wait until after lunch? We are celebrating his birthday today.
It was OK the first time Fred, but it's the same Halloween costume choice  every year, no one cares.
This is grim.
You should meet my mother-in-law.
Hey, you seen Marty?
You should have brought a lunch, son, you're all skin and bones.
Why did you call this meeting?
You are kind of ruining our joke here.
So I shouldn’t eat the sardines?
The head of the line is at the other end.
First you join the union then you get the job
You know you'll get fined if they catch you with your tools at lunch.
How much more do you want us to shove over?
How does this view compare to looking at eternity?
Nah, I'm still on the clock.
Are you having lunch, or just desserts.
No health care? No paid leave?
Our boss would love a guy like you.
There’s  no exceptions. This girder is for card carrying union members only.
You must be the new union rep.
Is it just me,or does it look like we're going down today?
A lot of Broadway musicals close on opening night. You'll bounce back.
Could you split this sandwich for us?
Well, I guess that leaves one sure thing in life
So that's where scraper came from.
you can go now. Your shift is over.
Hey, did you manage to meet Jim? He was on his way down...
Yo ... Joey, someone here ....sez he know ya!
But we all eat a balanced lunch.
A beautiful fall morning
You fellas mind if I hang out up here for a bit?  New Yorkers are terrifying.
So what do YOU think about this new “group life insurance” idea?
Could you come back on a Monday?
What'd you reap for lunch?
No, I don't have any deviled ham.
Hey, take any of the guys to my right.  
The lunches my wife packs me are nothing to die for...
Something tells me Wall Street's bull run is about to end.
So tell me, why do you architects always wear black?
Is it lunch time or our last meal ?
What are your thoughts on the recent union push for safety harnesses?
Do you have a green card?
Scared of heights? Looks like you've seen a ghost.
If you had a union card  they’d  have given you a box lunch too.
Uh oh the OSHA inspector is here
The guy at the other end says you don't exist.
Oh come on, really!? My old man ate ham sandwiches for decades!
Some shop steward.  Did you even try for safer working conditions?
You wanna lead the prayer before lunch?
Hey are you friends with Fred Trump?
Buddy, whadaya mean by 'one fell swoop'?
Sorry, but the smokers are on the ground floor.
Shouldn't you be down at the bottom?
Well, don't quit just because Pestilence and Famine did.
Sorry to tell you but everyone that has fallen was sitting in your spot.
Then we decided no more preservatives ... too dangerous.
Here, take some of my lunch. You need some meat on them bones.”
Did you know you had a fear of heights before you took this gig?
That's a really bad idea for a Halloween costume, Joe.
I'm guessing my major concern should not be that my tuna sandwich is a little bit warm.
Ok, so you’re not the OSHA rep, but I know you look familiar.
Never would've figured you - for a fear of heights.
Be careful not to drop the tool. It can kill someone down there.
I brought wings for lunch. You?
I'm dying to know what you're having for lunch.
i think you are making everyone nervous
What happened to Bill?
Don't look at me, it's the fall that will kill you.
Sometimes six feet under does seem pretty faraway.
So, you’re afraid of heights?
With an outfit like that, you must be making a killing.
Please tell me you’re wearing a terribly conceived Halloween costume to the most inappropriate work environment possible. Dude.
Forget your lunch?
Yeah, Louie's the third one from the end or in your case, the first one to end.
Its the rivets isn’t it?
I always feel that way too when I forget to pack a lunch.
Are you here because I looked down?
He wants to know who ordered the croak-monsieur.
... but I brought Angel Food cake.
Working up here, the scythe's the limit.
I'll trade you my fruit snacks for a pack of Camels
My sandwich tastes like death warmed over
Is this a promo from that life insurance company?
Guys, I think there might be something in our sandwiches.
Why yes, they do look like ants from here.
If I pushed you off of  here, would you die?
Nobody here has a death wish. Why, do you?
Are you sure you're not from OSHA?
Would you at least wait until I finish my lunch? My wife finally packed something that won't kill me."
Hey bud, could I borrow your knife?"
I don't think you should have that scythe up here, it's not safe.
Looks like you forgot your hard hat, too.
Damn, I hope that's just a Halloween costume!
I'm hoping you're here because you forgot your lunch.
Sure, but it taste like death warmed over, no offense.
When I told my wife that the kale diet was killing me, I had something else in mind.
The new OSHA mascot is freaking me out
Um, no...Fred's not here. You, uh...picked him up last week.
You mean it's because we whistled at her?
When did this become a Right-to-Die state?
You got a bum steer pal.  It's safer up here than it is down there...
So, how long have you been an actuary?
At least you don't have to worry about gluten.
Lunch is starting to look pretty grim.
So, first time on the beam? Don't worry, safest place on earth.
My friend is wondering if you're the structural engineer?
Please, take my lunch - I insist.
Shouldn’t you be down below?
I guess you don’t need lunch.
Dude, we said we were dressing up as high-rise workers this year. Get with it.
Any chance you'll settle for half a sandwich?
Do you have any food allergies?
C'mon. who is it this time?
This is the way we had lunch before OSHA.
Are you taking us in order?
You should take somebody who's already finished their lunch.
Can I borrow that for a minute, I need to cut my sandwich in half.
The work-life balance is great
Relax! It won't be a fall--it'll be the potato salad you forgot to keep in the cooler.
You won't have to wait long. My estranged wife packed my lunch.
Do you want to be in the picture?
Just because we knew you'd be here doesn't mean we'd order lunch for you.
Don’t give me that sunken cheek look. You’re not getting my lunch again.
That's not funny Jimmy
so which one of us has the contaminated lunch?
Starting tomorrow I'll eat salad.
Yes, we cheat you every day, but there's no sense being bummed out about it; you'll win in the end.
Can you wait till tomorrow ?  Today I've got a pastrami sandwich for lunch.
You're not so brave sitting up here with us - you're already dead
Aww, I should have added bacon today.
Nice view, but I’m dying to get off this thing!
So, which union are you in?
So, you're certain it's going to be food poisoning. . . no possibility of say, well, I don't know, an accident of some kind???
Say, if you're 'cropped' out of the photo, is that good by you?
You didn't tell me that you were deathly afraid of heights.
No one likes a pushy insurance salesman
The Halloween party is NEXT week!
Would it kill you to eat something?
The guys are very interested in knowing  whether  you plan to work overtime this week.
Don't mind me, I'm from HR and I'm here to help.
Do you think he knows something we don’t?
Do you happen to know the time?
I am actually here due to the particularly bad strain of E. coli in the lunch you just ate.
Why waste an opportunity to flirt with Death?
Throw in the pickle and we have a deal
Hey, did you feel that tremor?
Next year, maybe forgo dressing up for Halloween, okay?
I guess you've already heard that my wife's angel food cake is to die for.
Are you in the union?
What about you? Sign up for the new union health plan yet?
How bout we see who you land on instead...
Never cared much myself for the graveyard shift.
You're not from the iron workers local are you?
How come I have never seen you here before?
Wait, WHAT would you do for my Klondike bar?
I don’t know. You got up here, buster, so you can get yourself down.
Did someone bring something with peanuts for lunch?
No offense, but you look like death warmed over.
Is the answer, my friend, blowin' in the wind?
Well,I won't eat it then.
Trade you.
The old lady didn't pack you a lunch?
So it wasn’t enough that you took Lenny last month?
If I didn’t know this was photoshopped, I’d be VERY frightened.
No way! You're afraid of heights!
Can you cut the crust off my sandwich with that thing?
Five dollars says I can do a backflip right here
Isn’t that pointy thing a little unsafe?
Anyone need their sandwich cut?
You win! I'll have a salad instead.
I'm scared of depths.  You?"
Technically, you shouldn't be up here.
Early? For what?
Hey, this is a union break,
come back after lunch.
How about trading your carrots for my existential dread?
This job's a real killer eh?
Hey! You got any lifesavers on you?
Sure I'll share my lunch with you. It's not gonna kill me.
Can I borrow that? I promised Jerry I'd give him half my sandwich.
It's not so bad if you don't look down.
Sure, it's a hot dog. But on a whole grain bun.
How come you're not eating?
I take it this isn't a lunch delivery.
Hey buddy, you mind looming somewhere else?
Oh, yeah?  Well, memento mori back to ya, pal.  Whatever that means.
This could be your lucky day.
You are ruining this photo op."
It wouldn’t kill you to eat lunch once in awhile.
Who’s the new guy?
That's not funny Stanly!
Any chance you're here to make sure I drop this on someone's head?
I’d like to offer you a trade.
I'd rather live on the edge.
Look, if you wanna hang out here there’s not much we can do about it— but for the last time, BANANA PEELS go in the TRASHCAN!
Please tell me you just forgot the other three lunches.
Are you going to wear that all month?
Yer a riot, Murray.
If you came for Escher, you've got the wrong cartoon.
It was the egg-salad sandwiches that finally got me huh?!  DID NOT see that coming!
You just wanted a breath of fresh air? Right?
Charlie wins, best costume!
Sure, I'd like some underground work for a change.
You’ve got a greater chance of being struck by lightning
Why are you asking if I have a Living Will?
Normally I’d say help yourself to whatever you see but in this case, . . .
Well, one of us is not going to make it home tonight.
I'll trade you my life for this bologna sandwich.
Cuz you’re new on the job, we’ll cut you a break. Put your tools down at lunch.
Be careful not to drop that, it could take someone's head off.
You look emaciated. Have a twinkie!
You're right when you say that most people would kill for a view like this, but have you talked to the guys six girders up?
You’re kidding. You worked with Elvis, Frank, Tupac, and Biggie and now you do this?
Same lunch everyday! I'm gonna die of boredom.
On three! Ready?
Hey, what union are you in?
What local you from?
You expect a hot sandwich? Go to hell!
No I don't want to play musical chairs!
Are you really the skysreaper?
So, does it seem really high up?
For you, I mean.
'"They're receipts.  We cheat death and the IRS."
No one brings candy, and besides, you're nine days early.
Are you sure you're 'union?'
Can you at least tell me if I’m going to fall or if it’s my cooking?
Normally I see you at the bottom.
The last guy who sat there thought he was on the cutting edge too.
Don't leave us in suspense. Which one of us is going to fall?
I bet you'd kill for some of my chicken parm, wouldn't ya?
OK, so you came for the guy over there with the camera and tripod?
You gonna eat your sickle”
Sky scraper, pass it along...sky paper, pass it along...skim peeper...grime pepper...grim, er..."
Don't worry,I'm just here for the view
I think  I'll pass on the egg salad
Looks like the new guy forgot his lunch!
You didn't touch this, did you?
I think I’m falling for you.
You do know that nobody ever dies up here.
What are you, the prim reaper, too snooty to wear overalls?
it's like that old saying, on a clear day you can see forever, am i right?
Was it the pumpkin spice burrito
I knew gravity was a risk, but trans fat? What the hell is trans fat?
We plan on making this picture famous, you can't be in it.
I don't mind you sittin' here, but if you think you're gettin' one of my Little Debbies, you can shove off.
Would you take a ham and cheese with minestrone instead?
Is this Undercover Boss?
Would you mind moving over a smidge, you're in the shot.
I love the work you do out in Chicago.
I love eating lunch up here. The view is breathtaking.
I was just kidding when I said, “Beam me up Scotty.”
Show us your union card.
Wow, you say you've Fallen before?
You could get us all with just one push.  But that would be cheating.
Would you like my lunch? I'm not hungry all of a sudden.
Hey, no fair bouncing on the bar.
Shouldn't you be down on the sidewalk?
Aw, go photo-bomb Ansel Adams.
So, the headline about what the new Court means for unions should be taken literally?
You think you're 'grim'? My wife forgot to pack my Twinkie!"
'Do you have any allergies or intolerances?'
You need to start bringing lunch to work, you’re all bones.
Lay off Walter... Who made you the cholesterol expert anyway?
Well, at least I have a great view while I choke on my sandwich.
I always knew that egg salad was going to be the death of me.
Whatever you do, don't drop it.
Can I borrow that to cut my apple?
So you're telling me that these high fat lunch meats are going to kill me?
Yeah, my wife's sandwiches are to die for.
I'm guessing we should take our times with lunch.
Should I NOT open my lunchbox?
Having you sit next to me makes me feel a little "edgy!"
You OK? You look really pale.
Did you know the #1 workplace killer is bad eating habits?
Its a devil's food cake. Want a slice?
He put up quite a fight! I had no idea how dangerous your job is.
No offence, man, but you're redundant.
Great costume, but isn't the Halloween party next week?
Jimmy called in sick for the last time.
Worst Halloween costume.  Ever.
What do you mean fried chicken isn't good for my heart?
Paul didn’t you get the memo? We decided NOT to dress up for Halloween.
No, thanks. My wife slices the apples in my lunches before I leave for for work.
The fall don’t hurt ‘ya, its the sudden stop at the end.  But I guess you knew that!
We have a bone to pick with you.
Trade you half a bologna sandwich for my life.
If you'd come back Saturday, we could get time-and-a-half first.
We feel micromanaged with you watching us at lunch too.
So it looks like this is our last meal?
Yah, it's tough in New York. Everybody has to moonlight.
It was at this moment Leo realized why Antonio had not purchased lunch
Ask him whose lunch he's after!
Just be careful. One slip and we’ll all be here forever.
Nothing personal, but any of us who fall off is required to get a union Grim Reaper.
Guessing you're not a fan of OSHA either, huh?
Just out of curiosity, can you fly?
Are you trying to tell me not to eat this bacon cheeseburger?
Sorry, but we’re already one over the safe loading regulations
I appreciate the offer but "Death from Above" is my Air Force tattoo, not a request.
Thanks for the deviled eggs
I told you yesterday that your tuna sandwich did not look like it had been properly refrigerated.
'Will that thing cut some hard salami!'
How many times do I have to ask you to stop following me!
Looks like somebody's ex packed his lunch.
Yeah, and what if I don’t give you my lunch?
Oh crap Larry’s here. He’s gonna try to high five you... you’re going to want to resist that.”
Don't look down... you'll be scared to death.
You made your point, I’ll stop telling these guys that my lunches are to die for!
Yeah, it always kills me when I leave my lunchbox on the ground.
Nice to meet you, I’m Humphrey Dumpty.
This is low, even for you..
But we haven't finished our sandwiches yet!
We're dyin' for some labor laws.
Don't sneak up on a guy like that, someone could fall.
Marv, not for nothing, but that's Pete's spot.  Isn't it a little, you know...soon?
Insurance covers, right?
Yes, I do have a banana.
Do you really have to sit this close?
Guys, this is Grim. He's going to be working the lunch shift from now on.
You didn't see the Velcro on our pants.
Sending you up here is just plain overkill!
Are you here to visit anyone in particular, or did you just want to hang out with the guys?
You gotta try some of  my wife's chicken salad.   It's to DIE for!
We're having lunch so if you don't mind could you be the Grim Leaper?
You're not union!  What are you doing here?
No, this is September 11, 1901.
I still don't know why you would like us to have lunch up here.
Ironically, the LAST guy who wore a dress to work fell to his death trying to stand up after our lunch break.
My wife makes an incredible meatloaf sandwich. Want half?  It’s to die for.”
Your right to work is killing the unions.
Our safety manager came in costume today.
The guys are kind of superstitious and are wondering if you can leave the scythe at home.
Dude, chill! It's lunch break!
You SURE these scallops are fresh?
Who’s next?
What's with the balancing bar?
Are you afraid of heights?
I've got aged, air-cured mortadella with raw-milk cheese, aioli and foraged forest mushrooms.
The food's not great, but you're paying for the view.
How about I give you half of my sandwich instead?
So what do you mean exactly when you say that the company life insurance is to die for?
The guys want you to extend your lunch as long as you want today.
Halloween was yesterday, bub.
What do mean not everyone gets a box lunch today?
Any relation to Joey Reaper?
You'll get used to it. We learn not to over-react.
I already dropped my hammer for you, and now you want half my sandwich?"
Look, let's be honest, the morning didn't go well.
The union says you can’t dress that like anymore.
No, you can't be in the final photo. Because the foreshadowing is too obvious, that's why.
I told her,"Shelly, you're killing me with the tuna loaf."
Didn't you hear? This Halloween we're all going as 1930's steelworkers.
It's a stairway. You never heard of Led Zeppelin?
Yeah, sounds like a really terrifying line of work, pal.
I will trade you my lunch for a guaranteed 50 more years.
Don't you get a lunch break?
Heads up, new guy--the union don't allow sickles on the job site.
Heck of a toothpick you have there!
Just tell me if it's the egg salad that brought you here, 'cause I'm starving.
I'm guessing your not here about the high sugar content of these doughnuts.
Lunch FIRST. And don't be so pushy.
Shouldn't you be wearing closed-toed shoes?
All of a sudden, I've lost my appetite.
You union or non?
He said, "Could you just move over a bit"?
Wait... I have cancer?
The costume party is after work.
Okay, guys, let's finish up. Looks like the lunch break is over.
The salami was that bad?
Whoa there fellas . . . Just a reminder from your HR department reemphasizing the importance of taking a few minutes to pay attention to your safety and health at your place of work.
OSHA" you say. What's that
Wanna trade?
Still cutting headcount are we?
You were late this morning----Traffic?
Whaddya mean, I look like I might be a little dizzy?
I prefer to think the glass is half full.
I’ve got grim news.  Your  scythe is a Safety Hazard !
I hope we lose Bob instead of our jobs.
The fall is a great time of year, don’t you think?
We're all glad you found another job after you fell off the 45th floor.
No lunch?  No wonder your nothin' but bones.  Hey, where's Charlie?
Hey, look at badass afraid of heights.
I think the wife was right. I should’ve read the expiration date on that can of tuna fish.
Shouldn't you be down on the street?
Hey, Grim, no heavy tools on the lunch beam.
What a killer view of the park!
No, it's cool. My wife cuts up the apple for me.
No Lunch?
Yeah, Yeah, we know our lunchmeats are high in cholesterol.
Don't be alarmed fellas. Truth is I'm out of a job.
Who is going to tell him he's off today?
You want to play chess... up here?
Blow off, bud!  This ain't no Ingmar Bergman movie!
Aw,..C'mon!!!!
So are you pro-union?
You're the odd man out, you go get the coffee
Don't worry, he says he's just taking a holiday.
I'm new. Do you come here often?
Did you drop your fork again?
Think you dropped something.
Shouldn’t you be on the ground?
Can you at least wait till' we're finished?
Knock it off, Al, it's lunchtime!
Guys!  This doesn't look good!
Do you want my pickle?
Should I be placing a help wanted ad?
Know any good jokes?
So, what happened to your lunch buddy?
Ham and Cheese. Why do you ask?
I told y'all grandma's cookies are to die for.
Don't waste your time, we're all eating gluten.
I thought immortality was a win for everyone, but I never really thought about all the reaper-cussions.  Ha ha! Get it? Hello? What’s with this guy... 
Anyways, pal, welcome to the working class, I guess...
I was gonna wear my Halloween costume to work, too.
You're new here.  Relax.  It's natural to feel afraid at first.
Mind if I borrow that? Forgot to bring a knife.
I’ll trade you my sandwich for at least one more year.
I said, ‘Would you like a pickle?’
Hey skullface, quit shakin’ the beam!
Speaking of the devil.
You really take this trick-or-treating thing seriously.
Maybe he just got off on the wrong floor.
Simon says take three steps forward.
I’d share my lunch with you but my wife’s cooking could kill you.
Half a salami sandwich for six more months? You’re killing me!
Half a ham 'n' cheese for immortality, huh?
Jump.
Since you asked, I'd kill for a beer.
I suggest you stop talking non-union before someone has an accident
When I was young, it was safer to go door to door.
Uh,Oh ....
The costume is cute, but I think it's scaring the guys
I just have to ask...was it easier to get used to the heights when you're already dead?
Any idea what's in the mystery meat?
Hey buddy, you'll need to lose the blade. It contravenes our
'Occupational Safety and Health' charter
Go ahead and finish your lunch, we don't have far to go.
Careful with that blade, son...it could be dangerous.
So, is this you're first day on the job?
No.  I had liverwurst.  Eckner had leftover turkey. That's him at the end pulling the wishbone.
The tag says Brooks Bros. I'd lay odds its NOT a Halloween costume.
How much experience have you had?
Halloween is tomorrow, buddy!
You hungry?
You shouldn't feel bad - I always told him that life is all about balance.
Yes, we are Local 99's winning softball team! Why do you ask?
Is it what my wife packed me for lunch or will it be a fall?
I have a meatball sub to die for.
We refer to this time of year as Autumn.
You might be here for a while; these lunches are all organic.
This is Grimmy.  He's our new HR director"
Talk to the union steward, I've got bumping rights!
Harry's not here, he cashed out this morning.
She's the love of my life and we're gettin' married two weeks from Saturday.  Wanna see a picture?
I'll be with you in half an hour
So you forgot your lunch?  One day without a lunch is not going to kill a guy.
I'm afraid if you're not in the union you'll  have to leave.
Is this a bad break or lunch break?
If you're here looking for O'Malley, you're about 30 stories too high.
No, that is not what you wear on casual Friday.
careful.  If you fall you could hurt yourself on that thing
The union dues are killing me.
You know, I think I'd better just double check the expiration date on my snackables....
Be patient!  It's flu season and most of us don't believe in flu shots.
Want half?
I'm all for fiscal responsibility and de-regulation, but you're not what I expected when the administration bragged about how cutting funding would bring about the Death of OSHA.
I really hope this isn't foreshadowing.
sure, one kennedy i'd understand, but i think you might have gone a bit overboard
Why so pushy?
All’s we’re saying is, that work-life balance joke might work for the guys down on 29th
Well, you'll get used to it.
Hey pal, kind of dangerous sitting out here with that scythe, don’t you think?
So avoid smoking, family gatherings and the cheese fries at Big Berty's falafel cart?
The good news is that, as far as ways to die go, you're setting a high bar.
Tell me you're not afraid of heights...
Don't worry, you'll get less scared the more time you spend up here.
Trying to escape taxes?
Up here with us all day and no hazard pay? You should unionize.
We don’t really celebrate Halloween up here.
You think dying is hard? Try doing stand up comedy up here.
Well, I'm not giving him any of mine.
Sorry, I'm a little early. Don't mind me,  just go about your business...
I'd better feed him, or it'll be the death of me!
Lost your job after the recession?... Didn't we all.
The weather folks predicted high winds today - but I never put much stock in 'em.
No, I didn't hear anything about bad wind gusts.
Look Jim, I know you don't have many friends at the new job, but you can't keep coming back here for lunch.
Can I get back to you after lunch?
Well boys, the wife has finally talked me into getting a flu shot this year.
So, how was your weekend?
We've been told many times not to fear you, so piss off!
Donald...you look fabulous!
So it’s the cured meats that are bad, huh?
So, whose place did you take?
20 years of the same cheese sandwich in my lunchbox.  If I get one more, I will happily go with you!
I'll share if you let me borrow that to cut my sandwich.
Can I have lunch before we depart?
Oh, so you're vegan, now? When did that happen?
Good point--the trade barriers on foreign steel are gonna hit your bottom line too.
JIM!...quit playing around...
Is that OSHA’s new safety equipment?
Want a deviled egg?
A little shove, Charlie, and we’ll live forever.
What do you mean: 'No safety gear'
You come here much?
I'm sorry that you feel like we've cheated you out of a job.
I just want to say that, without you guys, my work would be a lot less interesting and I'm really glad we get to have these moments.
To be honest, the bacon isn't my biggest concern.
When did you join the union?
With you hanging around, no way I'm eating the fish!
Wait a couple of days, I can assure you that will be up to code.
Would it help any if I told you the guy down on the End has mini-Snickers.
They said these cheese and baloney sandwiches would kill me.
Believe it or not, I’m here because of the bodega sushi Tom’s about to eat.
Sam forgot his lunch, but I don’t think he’ll starve to death.
So you're telling me that in 30 years red meat and cigarets​ will kill us?
Carl, the costume isn't necessary to convince me to buy life insurance.
You’re sure the boss wants me to check on that lose board over there?
I'm here for you, in case you slip.
Can I at least trade my lunch first?
So tell me again what is new with our 2019 benifits plan!
This is the company's latest ploy for cutting our lunch hour to 30 minutes
I'm not crazy about the new uniform, but check out that tool kit!
You think the steel tariffs are that serious?
Don't be scared, it's not like anyone's gonna die.
There is no free lunch.
So you recently visited the economy?”
Care for some fallen angel food cake?
They don’t deliver.  You have to bring your lunch with you.
So you're saying I shouldn't whistle at that woman?
Nitrites?  Yeah - ALL baloney has nitrites...
Howie, didja ever think of seeing a a shrink for these moods ya get
We thought you were very good on The Twilight Zone.
Are you the new quality assurance guy?
So, G. R., big plans for the weekend?
But we all got the egg salad
Are you the new guy?
Afraid you’re outta luck pal, this union doesn’t allow dying on the job.
Looks like someone has a deathly fear of heights.
When is quitting time?
Seriously, Lenny, this is what you came up with for 'wear your costume to work day'?
I'm telling you, buddy, the building ain't finished and there's no giant ape.
Wow, isn't this just the greatest view you've ever seen? I mean ever will see.
Give you my lunch? You gotta be kidding. Why should I?
Does anyone want my lunch?
Thanks for coming but I think you're two I-beams over.
I know it's your first day on the job, but you forgot your lunch
Hey, beat it pal we’re on lunch.
I'm just saying...there's memento mori and then there's overkill.
Where's Fred? He was supposed to bring the beer.
Don't think for a second this lunch isn't going with me.
Is this about salmonella?
Watch out! It's the new supervisor.
Do you like "death by chocolate" ?
Uh no, this doesn't scare us to death.
So why aren't you in your work clothes?
You know, this job is not for everyone.
Well, okay, but just stop swaying.
it's alright as long as you don't look down...
Do want to draw straws or do you want to choose?
You have to bring your own lunch!
I keep telling you that you and the other grim reapers should unionize.
Enough with the trick or treat; get your own lunch
I told the union we shouldn't have given up the hazard pay!
Hey Fred, What are you going to be for Halloween this year?
You might want to eat something, you’re all robe and bones.
I'll give you half my ham-and-cheese on rye if you tell me where is the guy who was on your left.
You  have nothing to fear but fear itself.
What's a pastrami worth to ya?
Which local do you belong to?
The sourdough bagels are to die for...
I look at you and I see my future with this job"
I agree, this great city is slowly losing it's soul.
Half a tuna sandwich for ten more years is the Union rate, bub.
There WERE three more fellas here a second ago mister, I just wish I had a photograph to prove it.
We should have seen this coming from miles away.
Park it someplace else.
Any chance your break is longer than mine?
Mate, you want a deviled egg?
You think that’s a bad sign?
Is this another E coli joke?
Another ham and cheese sandwich. I swear, if my wife packs me ham and cheese one more time, I might die.
You want a slice?
I don't care who you are....get your own lunch!
You can have the cookie if you come back after lunch.
Could you fellas just move up a bit? It would make my job a lot easier.
I wouldn't eat that it'll kill you.
Aren't you dying of hunger?
So you want us to drop these one by one?
Ey new guy, what’d you say your job was again?
Rule #1: Never look down.
You’ve lost weight.
Will it be bad Bologna or a bad fall?
Aren't you a little old to be dressing up?
Aren't you a little out of your element?
Trick or Treat" ain't gonna' get you my lunch.
Jerry asked to borrow a KNIFE not SCYTHE
Hey Mac, be careful with that Scythe, we are on course for a safety record
Sorry, the service up here is dead.
No, please believe me, we're not trying to tease you.
Hey Bud, it ain't even near quitten' time!
Well, there's a story about someone being plucked off by a giant eagle, but I think it's apocryphal.
Don’t mind me. I am here for the view.
Who knew the most dangerous part of our job was the greasy food in our lunch.
Forgot your lunch, huh?
The burgers are that bad?
You know that you can't be seen in photographs, right, Death?
I’d give ya half of the wife’s deviled ham, but it might kill ya.”
Sorry, but I don't believe you're part of the cleanup crew. I'm not falling for that!
...and we'd like you to do an article on safety for the company newsletter.
Who invited you?
You’re gonna kill us all because we went 5 minutes over on lunch?
Well, if you're afraid of heights, why'd you come up here?
Hey Mister, you know people would die for this view.
Well, since you asked, the consensus of opinion seems to be "Well, at least he's Union."
You know, I'd kill for some hot sauce right now.
Maybe I should start eating healthier
Nah, my job's not dangerous. I'm an accountant. I only come up here to eat lunch because I enjoy the view.
Yeah! I hear the boss is looking to trim overheads.
Hey Joe, you looked a lot better before you started Atkins"
Hate to spoil your outting, boys, but one of you can expect a rather nasty surprise in your box lunch.
Didn't bring a lunch?
So, exactly when do you expect that hurricane?
I should worry about what risk?
So, let me get this straight, you're here to overcome your fear of heights; is that right?
But I didn't have the salmon mousse.
Who did you have for lunch ?
We understand!  Just don't look down....
“My wife sent me her special lasagna, she says it’s to die for”
Well we're not going to die of starvation, so you might as well come back after lunch.
You keep forgetting your lunch. No wonder you look like death.
Let’s make fun of the new guy!
We were hoping you were just hunting geese."
No guys, I'm not stereotyping high rise workers, I'm just playing the odds.
Don't worry, working up here is as easy as falling off a ledge.
You really should eat something.
The Halloween party? That's down at the union hall.
Careful, your robe might be a safety hazard.
If you don't eat lunch, you'll waste away to nothing.
You wanna be careful up here - the wind might catch that robe!
Please don't cut me off
Is it because I'm eating Twinkies with my lunch?
Does your sitting here suggest something?
Would you like to skip to the front of the line?
I'm starting to think we should try and get along.
No Bob, I don’t think wearing your Halloween costume to work was a ‘fun idea’’...

Leslie Hardin
Summit, New Jersey
The guys at the end...Blaine and Garrett...are you sure?   But they make the best rainbow cookies ever...
Something doesn't feel right!
Remember, up here you’re only one step away.
Where's your Union Card?
Can you at least wait until I eat my lunch? I'd hate to die on an empty stomach.
Mankind's curse is to be aware of our own mortality, but in the acceptance of the finite there is peace. Here, Mary packed me too much coleslaw. Take some.
Lunching on a Crossbeam reunion photos give me the creeps.
Do you hafta show up during lunch break everyday?
So are we all friends now?
Look here! Union rules says break for lunch! Next time 
bring some grub and leave the scythe on your bench!
Jim, at the end, says “take your time”.
Be careful with that. Accidentely bump a guy with that and he could fall to his. . . well, you know.
The view from up here makes you feel invincible, don't it?
I know, I've not been refrigerating my egg salad and now I have to pay.
If our boss finds out we're up here, he'll kill us!
Break’s gonna be over early - some safety-training thing we gotta watch.
Your other job doesn't have health insurance? You should unionize!
You've come to the right place to get away from it all.
It's very important that we all eat a balanced meal.
Er..........you´re selling life insurance?
I will trade you my meatloaf sandwich for eternal life??
Well, the benefits package is very competitive.
Have you had lunch?
People fault me for being a glass half full guy but you are just plain Grim Carl
You should go down and have lunch with the bosses. Maybe you can gently persuade them to raise our salaries.
Hey Pal. you look like you could use some lunch.
Let's make a deal.
Our Union Rep is a real kill-joy.
Hey pal, unless my wife poisoned my lunch, you're about 105 floors too high.
We eat our lunch here Monday through Friday from noon to one. Why do you ask?
Hey, Shel - remind me again about our workers' comp. policy...
I'm on a diet, too, and it's killing me.
I think he's from the union.
Maybe if you'd bring a lunch you'd look and feel better.
If flying is not one of your super powers you’ve made a serious mistake.
I knew we were putting too much mayo on these.
If you can figure out a way to cut my sandwich in half, sure I'll share it with you.
Hah! I packed the elixir of immortality for lunch.
Is that scythe sharp enough to slice a rhubarb pie?
I don't know if you work this way, but Not It.
We don’t need any added drama here.  Nine on an I-beam is unlucky
If I share you promise get lost?
You're new here?
If you're looking for Mike, he's gone underground.
If you were nicer I'd share.
I don't fear heights or death, but I am petrified of spiders.
Nope, nobody here named Carolyn. Have you tried downtown?
Looks like you need a holiday."
Hey Bud, you should be out on Workers' Comp.
Jump, or I’ll push.  Someday this will be an iconic photograph and we don’t want you in it.
I think you might want the other “High Line”
Jump - I dare ya!
Don't look at me, I didn't push you
Does this mean we should be afraid of heights?
I dunno about you, but that UN climate change report has me really worried about my future.
Is today Halloween?
Ah come on!  Today is pastrami day!
Didn't we tell to bring lunch everyday?  Now look at you.
This guy is not too bright. Everyone knows a robe can trip you up.
"Who is on your lunch menu?"
Your Right, there is no other way down
How was the film shoot in Sweden?
No offense, but the whole idea of climbing up here was to avoid the wear-your-Halloween-costume-to-work crowd.
Sure, there's your knife but where's your fork and spoon?
So tell me, what do you think caused your fear of heights?
So that’s it? We just drop these on those “ants” down there?
Does that thing cut through iron?
Why will no one have lunch with you? You're too damn judgmental."
Pam Henline, Little Rock, AR
This is, what, your third working lunch this month?
The guys and I feel like you're a bit of a stiff for this line of work.
I thought you said this was a free lunch.
You’re early for the night shift.
After the first few seconds, it's like sitting at your kitchen table.  Why do you ask?
Got any mustard?
Eat a healthier diet or else, my wife said. This is her idea of a friendly reminder.
It's the sandwich meat that gets us?
You here because of the height or because of the bologna sandwiches for the past 30 years?
Ugh, again? Seriously?! Yeah...I 'guess' I can give you half.
You said you were going to bring cold cuts.
Ya' know there's iconic and then there is really scary iconic.
Does your insurance covers post-existing conditions?
Who would have thought bad mayo on the turkey sandwiches would be the problem?
I thought Death only came in 3s.
So if my wife's packed lunch doesn't get me, there's you.
No thanks, I'm on a diet.
Sorry we're at lunch. Please come back another time.
Up here we share everything.  Whad'ya got?
Don’t mind me...just waiting for one more to hit my monthly target.
Greg, I told you no Halloween costumes at work
Can't Death wait until after lunch?
Who did you say would drop by at lunch?
So what kind of benefits does your union have?
Is this about eating bologna every day?
What do you mean you're not in the union!
It's not an omen. It's Charlie's Halloween costume.
And the winner of Iron Workers 235 Best Costume goes to...
Be not proud, and get your own lunch.
I’m busy ... but it’s kind of you to stop for me.
Buddy, I told you it’s just for a picture!
Death, be not hungry?
He says our cholesterol is very high.
If you don't pack a lunch, you'll never get some meat on your bones.
We call it Morbid Mondays.
If my wife packs me tofu turkey one more time, I'm gonna die
Bob, it's fine. You can have some of my sandwich. Don't look so mortified.
Can we meet at the bottom in 20 seconds?
Yes, it’s a high iron diet
You look new.
I don't eat dairy either; it goes right through me, too.
Really! We've never met a vegan before.
Are you here to deliver the 'death by chocolate'  dessert?
Fella, I'd die if I forgot my lunchbox!
I don't know, Grim. That seems kind of dangerous.
It's time you brought your own lunch.
Oh, that was Jack going to jump. Until he got that recording contract.
I got ribs, no offence"
What'll you trade me for a half of a ham sandwich?
Hey, MY riveting was all good!
Oh snap,'new-guy' forgot his hammer AND his lunch!
You're afraid of heights?
I think the parade is down in the village...
Sorry pal, but on pot-luck Wednesday ya gotta bring something to share if ya wanna join in.
Your feet killing you, too?
Shouldn't you be over on Pennsylvania Ave? That's in DC not NYC.
Can I borrow that to slice my baloney?
Central Park is down below; go harvest there.
I thought the Halloween party was after lunch
Ya look'n for someone?
What, no lunch?  You really need to put some skin on those bones.
If we keep eating from these donut boxes, you won’t be needed.
What do you mean a salami sandwich will kill me?
You guys aren't gonna die, I was just wondering if I could have a bite of that ham sandwich.
Hey pal, it’s lunch time NOT launch time.”
Can I at least eat my sub and be in the picture first?
It’s vegan, I promise.
Why do you need to know if I brought devil’s food cake?
In this economy, I’ll take any work I can get.
Uh, how come you didn't bring a lunch?
styx is for kids.
Say, don't you work in the kitchen at 725 5th Ave?
I used to sit on that spot.
Oh c'mon, don't act so surprised.
Ah, come on - you'll get used to it: it's a living...
I bet you can't get over the fact that the view from up here is larger than life.
I can assure you your day hasn’t been hell.
It was only a matter of time.
Want my lunch? Looks like I’m next to go.
Grim forgot his lunch again.
" You can have half my sandwich for five more years."
I admire a man who fully embraces his own work.
Yeah I think that costume is inappropriate, 
and yes, I know its Halloween.
I can't go on without lunch
Sometimes it's murder up here.
None of these guys are afraid of you.
We could just stage the whole thing.
Amscray! No cuts. Union rules.
The fellows and I appreciate your enthusiasm for Halloween.. It's your costume choice that has us somewhat concerned.
You're gonna have to speak up.  I'm fighting an inner ear condition.
You know Smitty. He's always late.
No, I don't have enough lunch to share. Whatcha gonna do about it?
Full time with benefits, plenty to reap.
Afraid of heights, buddy?
Watch your step, if you fall from here you'll kill yourself.
Aren't you worried about dropping that thing?
Who's on first?
I couldn't help but notice your scythe isn't ergonomic.
You gonna finish that?
I knew packing a beer for lunch was a mistake
You can cool it with the constructive criticism
You’re welcome to join us, just let us know when your break is over OK?
Will you move down a space if I share my sandwich with you?
Have my pickle.  Maybe you'll stop feeling so grim.
I guess the accident hasn't stopped Larry from hanging in there until retirement.
Hey Grimmy, no scythes up here. It's too dangerous.
Somethin' tells me I don't want what you're tradin' for lunch.
Careful!
Not working today. Just here to see what there is about you guys that you can cheat me so easily.
My girder is killing me!
Bologna again, Reap?
Well, what are you waiting for?
That's a funny looking hammer
You're dead serious about this vegan diet aren't you, Glen?
Do you think half of a baloney sandwich would help?
You've got to take that up with my union rep.
Believe me, it’s a bad idea to work on an empty stomach.
They want you downstairs after lunch.
Because of you we’ve all been suspended.
It's a killer view alright, but relax.  They can't fire you once you're in the union!
Don't eat the mayo
I told you, the Halloween party isn’t until after work.
DOA?! Naw, I brought a BLT today.
You don't scare me any. I've got double indemnity.
Look, you can have some of my liverwurst again if you want, but you gotta stop coming by every day at lunchtime!  You're making the boys nervous!
Wanna share my chicken salad sandwich? It's to die for.
Banana?
Look, no trans fats!
Don’t tell me you’re the only one getting overtime.
Hey buddy, can you cut off the crust
Oh, that's not good.
Hey buddy, do we have to talk job deadlines? We're at lunch!
First you come for our Twinkies, and now you come for our PBJs. Where will this madness end?"
So, did you bring a lunch, or are you just here for the view?
Relax. You can finish your lunch first.
Carl, did you do something different with your hair?
Hey, buddy, think you could lend me a cigarette?
So you're saying that, technically, even if I slip and fall you're still murdering me.
Hey guys, the new guy want a group hug.
You're not Vegan by chance?
Final offer: ham and swiss for the secrets of transcendental immortality.
So, you came all this way to tell us about better nutrition?
So you just got back from the Chrysler Building, huh?
you mind scooting over a bit, I almost lost my lunch.
But I thought the salmon mousse truck was up to code.
Of  hunger. HUNGER!
New presidential cabinet
So, what’s that for?
The last two guys on my right are the only guys who believe in the afterlife.
OSHA what?
Don't be so afraid! It's really safe up here.
Why didn't you bring Lunch?
No wonder you're so glum, we're all death defying, the one thing you can't be
Hey, the guys want me to tell ya, no tools on the I-beam. One slip and it's scytheanardo.
Let's not tip the balance buddy
Wow, sounds like your last job was a real bummer.
Know anything about Bill?  He was the 9th guy on this job.
Good luck landing a vulture for lunch, but you might get a pigeon.
Tell me about the short cuts you wuz suggestin' so we can all knock off early?
Do you want to trade?
What kind of deal can I get for a ham and cheese?
Anybody want to trade for this guy's killer pastrami on rye?
I'll trade you my peanut butter and jelly for your scythe.
Don’t lose your grip!
Why so grim? The safety of this girder is certain.
I'd offer you  a sandwich but it would go straight through you
If you ever feel like you want to talk to someone about eating disorders we are here for you.
And treble time at weekends? I'm in!
I'd offer you half my sandwich, but I'd be afraid if you didn't like it."
Tired of your dead end job? Go ahead and jump. You can always say I pushed you.
Wait, you must be mistaken - I didn't pack my last meal request
The costume party is next week, Jerry, enough with the shenanigans.
They said it was my turn...to bring lunch.
What do you mean you already ate?
Who are you calling "off the beam?"
So you are the new crane operator?
It’s a 3-day-old tuna sandwich, isn’t it?
Trump is laying us all off permanently
Can I finish my lunch first? My wife's lasagna always bowls me over.
Why don't you just sit here, have my lunch, and enjoy the view? I just remembered I've got some things to do and will just mosey on. Bert here was telling me about how his wife just found out about his girlfriend and can tell you all about it...
You know, we really should be careful up here. What makes you think we shouldn't use harnesses?
Well...John always takes my jello cup.
Forgot your lunch again?
I'll trade you my tuna sandwich for that cool  sickle.
No, I didn’t invite him. He just walked up and quietly sat down. He seems friendly enough, but having a stranger up here sort of creeps me out.
The union sent me to make sure they follow their safety rules!
The rest of them have bologna sandwiches. Make a deal for a Twinkie?
You'll die of starvation up here if you don't bring lunch.
Nobody has a butter knife. Can we borrow yours?
Yeah, I know.  My feet are killing me too.
No, I don't want to trade lunches.
Of course I’ll share my lunch with you...can you pick on the next guy instead?
Careful! If you fall, you’ll die.
It’s not the end of the world when you forget your lunch at home.
What’ll you give me for my Twinkie?
Try jumping. I swear I'll catch you
I think I may be allergic to peanut butter.
Can you wait til after lunch to punch us out?
What are you having?
I'd take the rest of the day off.
Thanks!  I've never had salmon mousse.
Those with a lunch are staying. Those without a lunch are coming with me.
My egg salad sandwich has only been in my lunch box for a couple of days ~ want half?
I've been trying to cut back on my cholesterol intake.
Who are you thinking of having for lunch?
I told you that would happen if you keep forgetting your lunch.
Don't be so grim, fella, we do this all the ti-i-i-i-...
"So... what are you going to be for Halloween?"
Tuna. You?
Why the no face?
Don’t jump!
John almost fell down yesterday. Too bad you were off...
It's all down from here boys.
Do you know where the other three men are?
New fellow? Don't worry. It's safe.
Your wife forgot to pack your lunch AGAIN?
Uhh, lunch is over.
A box full of banana peels - thanks, but I’m not fallin’ for it.
How about my tuna fish for your Scythe of Doom?
Relax man, no way falling can hurt you.
I asked for a POP-sicle.
Sorry, we only share with Union workers.
and since that day I've been coming here to think about life, you know?
This economy is hitting EVERYONE hard!
Pastrami on rye, why?
You know, the guys don’t really like it when the new guy gets all dressed up on casual Fridays. Makes ‘’em look bad.
No, we won't share our lunch with you. Bu the way, what happened to Fred?
So you’re saying this ain’t the 14th floor?
Generations to come will greatful​ if this time you take the photographer!
Exactly how am I gonna fit in this box again?
So even you need to sometimes add a little spice to your life, huh?
Hey pal, you plannin' on being here long?
I just noticed,  how come you didn't bring your lunch today?
Boy, he's dead quiet.
Is that a Halloween costume or do you always look so grim?
Do what you want but I’m not giving you my ham sandwich.
We typically go out for lunch:
At least your new job is closer to Heaven
Like I’m worried. If the wife’s chicken salad didn’t get me you are but a gentle breeze.
Trade for egg salad?
He's just been sitting there since October 1st.
At least you've got a ghost of a chance.
No, no delivery up here. We bring our own lunch.
I got a soul, you got any pickles?
Dude, if you fall you can say you escaped Death!
Up here, you'll live with you every day
Hey Bud, you’re making your job look too easy.
Next!
Baloney!
I’m sorry, but I’ve already got a constant companion.
I call it “Just-in-time” delivery!
I know it's Halloween,Gus, but did you have to wear that costume during lunch break?
Would it kill you to share your lunch?
We've reaped our limit.
What do you mean you might fall ?....
Here, catch this.
Rats. My wife knows I’m nervous about eating egg salad  when the weather is warm.
You forgot your lunch.
Excuse me, that seat is taken.
No lunch box?  You're dead.
so you're telling me you're not unionized yet?
Love the costume, but I think you're on the night shift!
Who let this guy up here?
And who gave him a union card?
If you really want to see death-defying, just try mooching Charlie's Twinkies.
For once, I wish I was closer to New Jersey.
What's your favorite thing to do during your lunch break?
It's a good job but the taxes are killing us.
Charlie? He quit yesterday. Vertigo, you know!
How does it feel to be included in the picture now?
Well,you beamed us up. Now what?
I knew we weren't supposed to have an extra screw.
Uhm...no, I'm not here for lunch.
That's a rather large fork.
Slicing your own ham today?
Look, man, this is the third time this week you forgot your lunch. Maybe you need to find another crew.
I get it, you're supposed to be Jack the Reaper this Halloween!
More like the grim-pire State building.
Who invited the new guy?
Sorry, we didn't know you're vegetarian!
Fancy a cold cut?
Yeah, thanks, but I'm gonna pass this lunch on over to Leon.
I could spare an orange.
We want you to lose the costime.
So, it's your contention that the scythe keeps you EMOTIONALLY balanced while working?
No need to work hard, death is imminent.
I guess you're a fan of 'Location, location, location.'
You could at least wait until he gets the picture right.
You can threaten me as much as you want...I'm not sharing my lunch with you again.
Did you forget to bring a lunch?
What did you bring for lunch?
I loved you in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.
Don't you have a lunch, mister? You're looking mighty thin.
Uhh...we don't usually dress up for Halloween
No lunch again? You're wasting away to bones and bones.
My wife is hard of hearing… I told her to pack me a sandwich, not a death wish!
Our building project might get finished sooner if you stopped wearing that costume to work.
No, I said POP-sicle!
Hey, man, I know that you would absolutely kill for this sandwich,
but "tuna on rye" is my favorite.
Sure, sure, there's room for one more, but you're not getting any of this Pastrami, pal.
Trust me, people would notice if you were gone...
Just PB&J. Why? You want it?
Hey Buddy, thanks for giving us all these roller skates!
What are you lookin' at?
Did no one tell you today was picture day, Mike?
(no caption needed)
Grim I know it is tough all over - Sun Wukong here was the Monkey King, the guy with the cigar, Dorian, was a potrait painter and Michael down on the end was an Archangle. Give it a while, you'll fit in just fine.
Hey, new guy, you forgot your lunch!
You, uh... you usin' that?
... and then he said: "If I Fall Down A Helmet Won't Save Me, Right?"
Gah! Of all the days to forget mustard.
Non-union is later, pal.
Don't mind me I am just waiting for one of you
You want my apple?
Seriously, just one foot at a time, Don’t Look down.
Where is Security when you need them!
I'm OK with it Buddy, but please keep in mind that from where we're sitting, it's a lot closer to Heaven than Hell.
Do you get a high doing this?"
These projects always seem to take forever.
Funny thing... I don't have much of an appetite for heights either.
The guys and I feel that your presence may alter the whole tone and tenor of what we're going for, and thus adversely poster sales.
Is this about the trans fats inside here?
I guess you're just waiting for us to get off of here.
'No problem, you look like you could do with a sandwich...'
What do they pay you for overtime?
How'd you get your union card?
We've gone to great heights to bring you here.
I hope you’re getting overtime.
I can see you're feeling down. Next time try to remember to bring your lunch.
How did you get up here?  Skeleton key?
I guess we shouldn’t buy any green bananas
Our union at least gives us a lunch hour.
Look I get it,
dress for the job you want, but you don't see me with a red nose and giant shoes.
Would you be careful? That scythe could kills us.
If your going to jump, do it already.
It's not that I don't appreciate a free boxed-lunch, but if this is my last meal then I'd rather have wings...angel wings.
My wife and Pasquale the Sandwich Maker.  I don't believe you.
Don't look down, er... in your case don't look up.
Statistically, one out of nine aren't right for this job. Maybe you should consider a different career.
Did Steve pass along his chicken salad recipe per chance?
Welcome to the crew, Mr. Death. It's nice to know, no matter how old you are, there are always possibilities for career changes.
I’d give half of my sandwich but you don’t look that hungry.
This new guy is the reason we need to unionize
You are not afraid of the height,are you?
I got mortadella on rye. Wanna share?
I feel like I'm getting mixed messages.
Have you heard of Bitcoin?
Wanna get high after work?
He finally reached the end of the line.
I don't care that you brought your own scythe, I'm not sharing half of my sandwich.
You musta gone to the wrong address.  No Hallowe'en party up here.
No! I will not trade a severed head for my tuna sandwich.
What, you forgot your lunch too? Don’t worry, Jimmy’s going down for his.
Do you think the union’s time has come?
So, how's that new diet workin' out for ya?
Did you forget your lunch?
I would pat your back but I wouldn’t for two reasons.
Man, you still using processed meat on your sandwiches?!
That stuff will kill ya.
And how did they let you go?
In a rush, are you?
You’re from which floor?
Where's your lunch?
Whatever you brought, I'll trade you a tuna sandwich for it.
By the time the cartoon is published, we're all dead of old age anyway
Could I borrow that to cut my sandwich?
I'm always dropping my stuff. How about you?
Not to worry, it’ll make a killer Halloween costume.
Thank God you're here!  You saved me from another one of my wife's meatloaf sandwiches.
This is not the way it's supposed to go down, you know.
You must be gluten free.
You can have my lunch if you will go away.
Shut up? Or else, what?
Could you squeeze over to the right please?
My wife makes a killer sandwich.
I’m starting to think hipster restaurants may be taking things a bit too far.
We bring something to share. You obviously look like you didn’t get the message
The odds of WHAT are a lot better than getting my caption chosen?
I'll split it with you if you let me borrow the sickle to cut it.
Could you slice my apple into those cute little slices like my mom used to?"
Isn’t that Jake from second shift??
Holy shit!
Do you always skip lunch?
I wouldn’t eat that sandwich if I were you
I mean, are you surprised?
Grim, you forgot your lunch!
If she made quinoa again, I’m out.
You want some of mine?
Just like I told that guy, bring your own lunch next time!
You gonna finish that fruit cup?
Not Eating today?
Yeah, I could kill for a good laugh, too.
you are going to have to make a choice.
So, where's your lunch buddy?
Don't get any bright ideas, or I'll push you off.
Do you want ham and cheese or peanut butter and jelly?
Lunch hour is just about over.
Coffee, tea or me?
No, you can not have my Twinkie!
I can see my life flashing before my eyes from up here
Ham on rye. What’s yours?
I know you're new here so I'll give you a break, but we're not actually allowed to wear costumes to work until next week.
We are all sitting on the edge of death.
Sitting in for Harry?
Fellas, Fellas! I don't know about youse, but I am officially announcing my retirement, right now.
We'll give you some of our lunches but bring your own tomorrow.
It is so safe up here that even you can take a break from work.
Want to split a pickle?
We would like to all hang together rather than to fall separately.
After we share lunch, this job looks less grim.
Was this guy here yesterday?
I've got tuna salad that I can give you, but not my sole...
Did you really need to bring that thing?
Yes, there's a photographer here.  But you're definitely not going to be in the picture.
I hope this doesn't represent a group effort.
Too bad you missed him, said he's got an appointment with the street cleaner right there on Samarra Blvd.
You need to meet my mother-in-law. For 20 years since I moved her baby from Flatbush to Staten Island she been screaming your name to me.
Sorry, none of this is gluten-free.
Tofu.
Not into heights, eh?
Thanks for lunch, buddy.  But what are trans fats?
Are you sure we can't get any higher?
Any words of advice?
Darn...I told my wife this morning that her leftovers would cause me an early death.
I knew you were following me so I brought my chess set.
Huh. I thought SPF factors were a myth.
How many of you think my Halloween outfit is drop-dead gorgeous?
What's that for?
Tupperware? Oh yeah! We never take chances with our lunch.
That's  enough to spoil lunch !
I'm surprised you even made it in this morning, Ted. The traffic was murder.
Yeah, it's true.   Most of us have bacon sandwiches for lunch.
Hey, you like meatloaf?
Who's at the end of the line?
Sorry sir, this is the nut-free table.
Your lunch doesn’t seem to agree with you.
Forgot your lunch again? No wonder you're looking so skinny.
So they hired you to kill all the lawyers?
You can have my sandwich. I'm not even that hungry.
Care for a brownie? My son's roommate baked them.
I know a great therapist for that.
We bring lunches and you bring a scythe. What’s up with that?
It is easy for you to overcome your fear of heights...
You look pale. You sure you don't want to share?
Hey, Halloween on the beam!
I'm not here to make anyone redundant. I'm just
monitoring breaks.
NOT  YET...
Don't jump!  You have everything to die for!
You misunderstood. I said this was a first-class girder.

PSST, avoid the tuna salad sandwich.
Hey, I'll trade you my apple for that cool scythe, huh?
Sorry Mr. Reaper, can I call you Grim?, we only brought so many lunches...
The last one up goes down first.

Guys, I’m so full I could just die.
Hey Buddy, do ya know, is lunch break fifteen minutes or infinity?
Sorry we don't have anything gluten free.
Oh no, I think he came hungry.
Would you mind slicing my sandwich in half? I'd be more than willing to share with you!
Killing off someone just to get this job is a no-no as far as I am concerned.
You look worried, want to split a tuna salad sandwich?
Was this part of the iconic photo?
No thanks I already ate
What's wrong with the new guy? He just has first day jitters.

Who cut the cheese?!
Unless you's got a Union Card you better scram outta' here!
Do you have your spiritual union card yet?
I need to slice off some salami for my sandwich. You don't look like a meat eater, but could I borrow your, um, blade?

Could you reach the salt?
Salami on rye? Chips? An apple?
Please start packing your own lunch.
They want you to know our motto: We don't die, we're killed."
I understand you'll kindly stop for lunch.
He says that it is a cigar not a cigarette.........
Lost yer appetite?
I've got crusty bread so we'll have to use that to cut it in half.
Your subs are good but your tipping policy is a bit heavy-handed.
“It looks like you forgot your lunch box. Not to worry, we’re a sharing bunch of guys.”
It may look like an easy harvest up here, G.R., but these ain't lunch boxes we're holding.
Heating or A/C?
If I could figure out a way to share my sandwich, I would die happy.
It's sort of an unwritten rule, but generally
we don't bring our scythes to mug-up.
I don't know what bologna's made of, but I'm pretty sure it's already dead.
You sure this "Burial  Union" is legit?  Never heard of it.
Who ordered the smashburger?
I'd offer you some, but I don't want you to fall.
I’d rather Grim kill me before I look down
O.K., don't worry. Your day comes one guy at a time, one day at a time.
If you don't eat, you might get sick and die.
Ghost of Hallowe'en yet to come?

What's yas udder job again?
You just need to hang around some guys who don't cheat so good as we do.
Hey 'New Guy', how do ya rivet with that thing?"
Watching your figure?
Hey pal, why so grim? I asked for a pickle! Reap what you sow.
That is you, Joe, isn't it?  Just because it's Halloween doesn't mean you can come in costume.
Who are you eating today?
So, are you the new guy? The HR department has been hiring so many people lately!
You need to go back to where you came from...please!
The first step is your last
Can you pass the salt?
Um, well, so this is the first day on your job training?
You forgot your lunch again, new guy — how you gonna feed yourself?
I'd offer you some of my lunch, but up here, do you have the stomach for it?
Are you wearing your Grim Reaper costume for Halloween?
Do you like my Halloween costume?
Darryl I said to bring something with spread not something dead
Which one of you brought the Sloppy Joe?
Something I always wanted to ask. Do you prefer a hot or a cold lunch?
Are you trick-or-treating up here because of climate change?
So, what's for lunch?
Sure a Grim Reaper may be a lowly job but working with us may not be what most consider the highest of careers either!
I clearly heard no "leapers."
You can share my bologna sandwich so you don't starve to death.
It's fine if management says lunch breaks will become unpaid time.
Yeah, the mayo on this sandwich's been out in the sun too long.
I'd offer you something to eat but that scythe situation looks unsafe.
Yesterday's egg salad?  No thanks buddy.
Aw man, it figures. Who brought peanut butter?
Hey man, didn’t you get the HR e-mail that said “ no dressing in costumes for Halloween “?
What do you mean you forgot! It was your turn to bring the desserts."

We're having heroes. Want one?
Share lunch? Sickle my yard grass?
Lunch is on you.
If I share my lunch, will leave alone?
1.  What do you mean, ‘Our contract has a no-cut clause!’
2.  Thank you, no. I can peel my own apple!
3.  No, I use an electric razor.
4.  So, what’s the message from management?
You want to share my lunch?  You've been hanging around since 1932.
Just here for wishful thinking
Aren't you hungry?
Sorry, but my lunch ain't big enough to share. Why don't you ask Barney down at the end?
It all goes back in the box!
Just go take a flying leap. We don't need your type around here!
Is there something that you would like to say?
Next time he comes with a pack of smokes, O.K.?
I'm sure the union did it's best to save your job and ummmm we were all definitely on your side, but maybe it's time to move on.
We gotta stop getting these day-old hummus wraps.
work till you can't
Say, what's the guy next to you having?
Look, pal, I know you’re new and all, but you’re gonna have to ditch that plow thing and get a box like the rest of us regular guys, if you want to fit in. Just tryin’ to help you out.
Don't worry,we've left you the cheese and baloney
Did you forget to step out for your lunch?
Lunch for how many?
Hey buddy. Did ya' forget your lunch bucket?
Look, it’s that guy who ate all my candy!
Sure can see the scythe from here.
Wow, that's a gruesome looking pigeon...
who'd you have to blow to get that job?
The reaper doesn't want food. Guess he's empty on the inside...
Yeah, but last year you scared six Halloweeners off beams.
Grim Reaper, tell us another gory story.
Can't quite figure if I'm supposed to share with the guy to my right or with you. You into bratwurst?
Hey, get back to work - we're on our break.
Yeah....No one likes George down there and I bet he didn’t pay his taxes either!
There's this song that comes on the oldies station that tells us not to fear you.
What did you say Eddie was up to today?
BLT or PB&J?
Upscale trick or treating
It was your turn to bring a lunch to share, but all you do is take from us.
I probably shouldn't have broken wind walking by that peach flambé.
I'm the construction foreman here.  Where is your resume?
Actually,I ordered mine rare and with  cole slaw.This must be a side gig for you.
I have a gluten intolerance, so if you don't mind losing that scythe, that'd be great. Cross contamination could be the death of me, you know.
What put you up here?
NO lunch box today?
Did you forget to pack a lunch?
So, you're telling me The Three Stooges started out this way?
Hey new guy make sure you are being careful Kay?

Of course you have to follow him.
A lunch for the ages, eh?!
People call me the Angel of Death, but I still have to use the stairs.
It's time to drop dead.
Hey Dude, Ain't it kinda early Halloween celebration
They are cracking down on aliens.
who ordered the tuna on rye
Can I interest you in half a tunafish sandwich?
We said to come as 'lunch on a beam,' not dressed up like 'Scream.'
Oh, it's nobody's fault but my own! I was looking up...it was the nearest thing to heaven! You were there.” “Yeah that’s my favorite line, too.
We'd share, but what we have here is pastrami on rye, and you'd no doubt prefer ashes on caskets.

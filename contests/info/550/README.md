The histogram and example query are not present for this contest.


This caption contest was also live on the New Yorker caption contest page
(reloading, ads).

In this contest, for all captions that had at least one duplicate caption, I
included a single, exact duplicate of the original caption for comparison
purposes. These duplicate captions are listed below:

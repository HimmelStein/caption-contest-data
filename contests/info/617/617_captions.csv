But before we head down... a short fire-safety video...
No, this is Purgatory. Hell has FOX 24/7.
I wonder if he moved that pitchfork a little left would we get better reception?
No, purgatory. In hell, it's Fox News 24/7.
It gets worse. The commercials are for air conditioning.
It's either this or the PBS pledge drive.
I didn’t know there would be an orientation video.
It's not really eternal - if you watch closely it's a forty-five minute loop.
I hear the 1% get real fire...
This is boring as hell.
No, only the Catholics have real flames. We’re all Episcopalians.
Is it wrong to say you look hot?
He wants to make Hell great again.
Good news! If this were hell, they'd be showing Fox News.
This is it? Well, I'll be damned!
I guess it didn't really matter if I had on clean underwear after all.
No, you ask him to change the channel.
They've been making due with this ever since the place froze over in 2016.
One channel, one show, no remote, welcome to hell!
So this is ironic... last week I was standing next to a fire and watching naked people on TV.
It's a live feed from the White House.
It gets worse. In February they start showing reruns of The Apprentice.
Sometimes he changes the channel to Hannity
We only get two stations. Fire and Brimstone.
Did you give to the Trump campaign, too?
We're all Congressional staff. White House is two circles down.
The last thing I remember was accepting a White House appointment.
666 channels and nothing is on.
So this is hell - a 15-inch screen, rabbit ears and no clicker!
The cable guy said he'd be here between now and eternity.
Well the ride in the hand basket was fun
In heaven they have flat screens.
Wow, turns out stealing cable IS a big deal.
I can never tell the news from the weather.
...and then, when he said, 'You have a choice: It's either the flames of hell, or Fox News', well, that was a no-brainer.
Hell hath no cable.
Wish I hadn't pulled the tag off our mattress.
In heaven they have flat screens.
The irony is that I'm here for stealing cable.
And after this, we have to watch 14 seasons of The Apprentice.
So, you're a lawyer too?
There sure are a lot of white people down here!
666 channels and nothing to watch.
The Bible made this sound a lot worse.
When I first got here, we could only listen to the fire on the radio.
I really hate it when they give everything away in the previews.
At least it's a dry heat.
This is purgatory. Down there, they show reruns of The Apprentice.
It's either this or the PBS pledge drive.
Nine circles of hell, and we get stuck in the one without cable.
Yes, but its a dry heat.
Do we really need a 24 hour weather station down here?
If one more person says, “At least it’s not FOX.”....
This training video is taking an eternity.
The Devil Wears Nada.
I'd sell my soul for Netflix right now....oh wait....
"And it only plays Fox news".
Hey, at least it's not Hannity.
Do you believe he can make Hell great again?
He makes us watch this fire safety video once a year.
No, we're in Purgatory. This is just a trailer.
Cool! They have Hell-To-Pay-Per-View.
Yes, but its a dry heat.
Back in the old days we had real fire.
This orientation video is taking forever.
I've seen this episode before. It doesn't end well.
Yes, I'm sure we're in hell--black and white, no cable, one channel, and no remote.
It becomes hell when they switch to Trump's press conference.
On the plus side, there's no ads.
I'd kill again for a recliner.
In the 9th circle, I hear it's just "Hannity" on a loop.
It's the weather report.
There's only one channel, but liberals see Fox, and conservatives see MSNBC.
I don't understand...all I did was vote for Donald Trump.
Yeah, it's hot, but I've heard the second season is even hotter.
It’s pretty much just this and Hannity.
He's trying to reduce his carbon footprint.
I think the only way to get through this is to imagine everybody with their clothes on.
False idols. And you?
One channel and no remote? This is really Hell.
At least it's not Fox News.
So television really is the tool of the devil
These timeshares are always a scam.
The only programming we get down here is Fox News and the eternal fire. We leave it on the fire.
If I’d known that this is all it amounts to, I would’ve killed your mother right off the bat.
I knew we shouldn't have removed the mattress tag.
Is this it or are we in the waiting room?
Well, what do you know. It turns out that Hell was fake news!
Well, I'll be damned!
Do you dare me to tell him we’ll get better reception if he raises that pitchfork a bit?
They use to show us FOX News, but even they thought that was cruel and unusual punishment.
It's hotter in HD.
Dante would be so embarrassed.
We've done it this way since it froze over.
What’s the point of a fire-safety video?
Boy I hate these workplace training videos.
Of course, everyone has the option to upgrade to Premium Hell.
Typical. 9 Circles of Hell and nothing on.
The Devil Wears Nada.
We’re waiting for Sarah Huckabee Sanders to take the podium.
This is just the weather channel. If you complain, they send you down to watch political coverage.
Orientation videos are a waste of time.
I hate being the devil's advocate, but I am kind of chilly.
Is that Morgan Freeman's voice?
You expected real flames? There are way too many lawyers down here for that kind of liability!
We only get local stations
I’ll be damned. Hell really is having 500 channels with nothing worth watching.
With all the Comcast employees down here, you'd think we'd get better reception.
I understand this is just until the boiler gets fixed.
Another scorcher tomorrow.
On the bright side, half the people here are from the cable company.
They said we’d only need to listen to the talk for an hour before we had full access to the resort.
When they really want to punish us, they switch it to White House press conferences.
Before we get started please observe a short video which will help you discover that there is no nearest exit.
I don't know about you, but standing naked with a bunch of strangers while watching the news go up in flames is not my worst day.
I guess the Devil wears nada.
I knew if we voted for him we'd all go to hell.
The Meet Up Group read, 'hot, nude, adult entertainment.' I think I had something else in mind.
The picture looks like hell.
We're literally in virtual hell.
These welcome videos take an eternity.
I can’t believe we all used to work at the White House.
This is just a commercial. Hannity's next.
I always took it as hyperbole when customers used to say there is a certain place in hell for people who run cable companies.
The only other channel is brimstone.
Ever the optimist, Carl pointed out that they were dressed perfectly for the climate.
He keeps it tuned to world news to show us how good we have it down here.
At least it’s not the Kardashians.
Break’s over. Ten years of Fox News coming up.
Get ready everybody, He’s on his way to make Hell great again.
It only plays Fox News.
Hell! Another rerun!
I knew it would be bad, but I never dared imagine rabbit ears.
It's still better than Fox news
Ironically, I’m here for watching videos of naked people.
Cheer up. One level below us all they have to watch is Hannity.
I hear heaven has a flat-screen.
Apparently it's better for the environment.
Is this your first Trump rally?
I bet they have a flat screen in heaven.
Jerry Falwell was wrong about a lot if things.
Turns out, there is a special place for all who ignored the final PBS pledge drive.
Maybe if he turned his trident a skosh to the left?
That's why they call it Hell. We only get Fox News here.
A crowd gathers to watch the ever-popular "Face The dam-Nation."
I'd sell my soul for the remote. Again.
It only plays Fox News.
This orientation is taking an eternity.
The other channel is Fox News.
One day you're working for Fox News and then suddenly....
It's all fake news since hell froze over.
I’m really not supposed to be here, I’m an agnostic.
There's no remote. What else do you need to know about Hell?
At least there are no pledge drives...
These overflow rooms never really capture the mood.
What did I miss?
Somehow, it never seems real until you see it on TV.
Not so bad. I thought we’d have to watch Fox.
Didn't think I would be staring at a screen all day down here too.
At least it's not tuned to Fox News.
Guess who owns the media.
I expected fire and brimstone, but never fake news.
Fox News: Giving hope to the damned since 2016.
At least he doesn't make us watch Sean Hannity.
He's trying to reduce his carbon footprint.
I hate orientation.
If this is really hell they'd be showing 'Apprentice' reruns.
It's just not the same as being there.
Yep, every channel.
You'd think with the corporate tax cuts they could afford a flat screen down here.
So far, it's just been 4,000 years of waiting for the cable guy.
Oh look, FOX news.
If I’m being honest, this is actually one of the better orientation videos I’ve seen. But then again ... being honest isnt really my thing.
I suppose this means we're not going to get internet down here either.
Well, the training video seems relatively straightforward.
Great, another time share presentation that will last an eternity.
We’re singe watching.
Nothing's ever on, but I hear we're getting Cosby soon.
That reminds me - did you turn off the stove?
I thought there’d be more tattoos.
I didn’t think there’d be an orientation.
Showing a safety video before we enter seems like overkill.
We get 187 channels. But they're all Fox News.
Fox 24-7 and no remote.
It could be worse - at least we're not on the phone with the cable company.
It's just like everything else these days - instead of actually burning in hell, you experience it on reality T.V.
Season five seems like it goes on for eternity.
Have you noticed that no one here has a tattoo?
The guy with the pitchfork has the remote, but try getting it from him.
Before the cutbacks the flames were real.
Well, I was right. Hell IS watching Fox News.
I'm more bothered than I am hot.
Is this your first Trump rally?
Eternal damnation I can handle, but no cable is just plain cruel.
Oh No. Not the pledge drive again.
God IS merciful! I thought I was going to have to watch Trump.
I was the president's former press secretary. What are you in here for?
If I knew there was no cable, I would have led a better life.
I used to make orientation videos like this. Now I see why I'm down here.
We only get the weather channel.
It’s what we get for watching Fox.
Brimstone is on after this
First time at Burning Man?
If this is all they've got, we might as well get back to sinning.
Apparently, that’s the forecast for the rest of eternity.
How ironic. Lots of nudity, but no cable.
When the sponsor break is over, it goes back to Fox News.
I know, it really feels like you're there.
You think this is bad, wait until he switches to the news.
I told you it was one of those timeshare scams.
It's not the same as being there.
No, it's not the orientation video...This IS Hell...
It’s the fork! Perfect picture everytime he stands there.
I guess we all thought hot singles in your area meant something very different.
I'm actually good with this. You know upstairs they are watching Sean Hannity.
Great, another "fireside chat."
This is the 8th circle. In the 9th circle you have to deal with the cable company.
No remote, no cable, and just one local station? I'll be damned.
So you voted for him too huh...
I bet you never thought you'd miss your cable company.
According to the orientation video, it’s a dry heat.
I know we lied, but setting our pants on fire seems petty.
Looks like another day of record temperatures.
This or Fox News, your choice.
Brimstone comes on after this.
At least we're not watching the Kardashians for eternity.
Everyone's relieved when they first arrive, but after it a while it gets to be as boring as hell.
I bet the One Percenters get to burn in HD.
The hottest places in Hell are now reserved for Congress, so it's standing room only in the waiting lounge.
Is anyone else a little cold?
And next month it's 'The Apprentice'.
This really isn't my idea of "Making Hell Great Again".
I don’t know why we even bother. The 7-day forecast has not changed in forever.
Here, we only get flames. For Fox News, you need to go down more levels.
Spoiler alert.
Great, another one of his crappy home movies...
This is a commercial. Otherwise it's Fox News, 24 /7.
With all the billionaires down here, you'd think they'd spring for a plasma.
No, the TRULY damned are in the real hell. We're VIRTUALLY damned.
The regular guy is out sick, so we're just watching a video today.
It's a repeat.
I’ve seen this one. Everyone dies in the end.
Better reception than I expected.
It will be a cold day in hell before we get cable down here.
Who the hell voted for the weather channel?
It could be worse, I hear in the next Circle down they have to watch Fox News!
This is just the preview for us new arrivals. In real Hell he makes you watch Fox News.
That's it? I should have had more fun.
I expected fire and brimstone, but “FOX and Friends” is overkill.
I think the book is better.
These cooking shows are all the same.
The only other option was Fox News.
Don’t you think we can skip the instructional video? We all know why we are here.
Look on the bright side—it's not PowerPoint.
No, it's just the orientation video.
Could be worse. Could be FOX News.
There are certain advantages to being in the overflow section.
They usually just make us watch Fox News.
I hear in Heaven they get Netflix.
Purgatory isn’t that bad, in Hell they have commercials.
He’s reducing his carbon footprint.
It used to be a loop of Trump's inauguration.
Make Hell Great Again
The real torture is that they hide the batteries for the remote
I think you're hot.
"You're fired" takes on a whole new meaning here, huh?
The cable guy's supposed to be here sometime between 8am and eternity.
That’s the point; there is no remote.
If the Bible had said there would be no remote for the TV, I'd have been in church every Sunday.
We've been ordered to watch re-runs of "The Apprentice".
I thought the devil wore Prada.
Fox canceled it, but Hell picked it up for another season.
The First Circle gets cable.
I hate these timeshare presentations.
Who has the remote?
Do you find the laugh track a little creepy?
The channel changer is in heaven.
One channel? This IS hell.
Could be worse. In the next circle they have to watch Fox News.
Its a shame fox is the only channel down here
I could have done without the orientation video.
If we're good, they let us watch the White House Press briefing.
It’s been a century, would it kill him to change it to the smoldering ember channel?
This is the orientation video.
For good intentions. You?
If you wanted cable, you should have led a better life.
At least it won’t carry ads for erectile disfunction.
You're lucky, he used to do a PowerPoint.
I thought the book was scarier.
I never thought I'd find myself praying for commercial breaks.
It's amazing we still get Fox News down here.
And that's the weather forecast forever.
I'm actually relieved. I thought we’d be watching cable news.
I saw this one before. It does not end well.
You can tell it's Fake Hell. If it were Real Hell, Fox News would be on tv.
Before the budget cuts we used to have real flames.
Told you they wouldn't have cable.
Black and white? This really is damnation.
The actual fire just made everyone uncomfortable.
I bet heaven gets cable.
I’m amazed at the reception we get down here.
What kind of sin do you have to commit to get a real fire?
If you wanted high def, you should have been a better person.
If you think this fire safety video is out of date just wait until you see the sexual harassment orientation
This is just the commercial. Fox News will be back in a minute.
He's worried about his carbon footprint
With so many lawyers here, HR insist on these health and safety videos.
You think this is hell? Wait until the pledge breaks every ten minutes.
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?
At least the Weather Channel is more accurate down here.
He's really been working on lowering his carbon footprint.
At least it's a break from Fox News.
The brochure promised it would be someplace really warm with clothing optional.
One channel and only a 27 inch screen? This is Hell!
It's a nice break from Fox News.
The only thing worse than Hell is watching re-runs of Hell.
You can ask, but I think this is the only channel they get.
Look on the bright side - at least its not the golf channel.
It’s an effort to reduce greenhouse gases...
Even Dante couldn't have imagined this circle of hell: no digital, no remote, and a single channel.
We're toast!
At Christmas, they put a yule log on.
I should have been suspicious when he promised I’d even get to spend eternity with an old flame.
So who is going to ask if we can change the channel?
This can't be Hell, there's no commercials.
This would be hell, but for the nudity.
Who the Hell's got the remote?
I agree, checking the weather before getting dressed makes sense.
I wish we could watch something besides the weather channel
The 'Shopping Network' comes on at 5. That's when the torture really begins.
Rumor has it the ninth circle is watching Trump on FOX twenty-four seven.
It froze over after the election.
It's just the opening graphics. Bill O'Reilly will be on in 60 seconds.
Welcome to the White House!
You're hot.
Wish they would hurry up with the orientation, I’m freezing out here.
I'm not sure this orientation video is necessary.
It's the same forecast everyday---hotter than hell.
It’s true, we only get FOX down here.
It's the Trump Channel, welcome to Hell.
The new fall line-up looks really hot.
I thought virtual hell was just an expression.
No cable, no flat screen ... this is hell.
The weather channel again?
I can't believe they're making us sit through previews for an eternity
It looks like freezing over is off the table.
How long have you been on the Republican campaign?
I told you Hell would be watching Fox all day.
Thank you for coming to hell. We hope you enjoy this informative preview of eternity.
I swear to God, if he shows us one more home movie—
I hear the next circle down watches "Hannity."
Personally, I'm in heaven right now. The reception here is way better than in my old apartment.
Of course there's only one channel--it's hell.
The brilliant part is that we each still get a cable bill.
He's in a good mood today. Usually, we have to watch C-SPAN.
The Democrats in the catacomb next door have to watch Fox News.
On Christmas we get to watch the yule log.
The repair guy gave us a window of noon to eternity.
The other channel runs political ads.
Art imitates afterlife.
When lunch break is over they turn it back to Fox News.
If we smack it on the side, do you think could get snow?
666 channels, and still nothing good on.
For a guy, not having the remote is really the most painful part...
Maybe if we all peed at once..,
Hell of a show.
Thank god they changed the channel, I really needed a break from all the bad news.
This is hell, there is no remote.
After the on-boarding video, I hear it's a continuous loop of Sean Hannity.
You think this is bad. Wait 'til he switches to "Hannity."
Did you work for Comcast too?
This reminds me of your 50th birthday, most of your friends are here too.
Wanna cool off? I've got a picture of water back at my place.
Oh, I've seen this inferno thousands of times; it goes on and on for, like, ever.
They call it Hell-a-vision.
What in Hell are we watching?
Fox & Friends will return after a brief word from our sponsor.
I always figured hell’s cable would be set to Fox News
It's black and white and only three channels. Channel 6 FIRE, 66 BRIMSTONE, 666 FOX NEWS
At least we don't have to watch Fox and Friends.
Sure, it's hot. But it's a dry heat.
They call it Fox & Friends.
If you think this is painful, wait until you see the commercials.
So what brings you here?
Trust me, just keep pretending you are really hot. It beats the alternative.
Thank God I remembered my glasses.
It’s either this or FOX.
I feel naked without my iPhone.
Shhh... The President is about to welcome us to Trump University Post Graduate School.
I hear in Purgatory they get cable.
Sorry, this is the only place that would host the 2020 Republican Convention.
One TV, no cable - this really is hell
I knew it, 'hell' is watching reality TV.
I had a feeling watching Fox News would be mandatory here.
I don't get too close because the radiation from those old TV sets can kill you.
It could be worse; the next circle down is the all Kardashian channel
The lawyers in the next room say a real fire is too much liability.
It’s the Christmas music that really gets to me.
He says we'll get a flat screen when heaven freezes over.
It only gets two channels ... this and Fox News.
I so hate orientation videos.
I hear season 2 is even hotter
I hear that he's out of brimstone, too.
The worst part is we still have to pay for the bundled phone service.
I know you're all disappointed, but we're making the switch to a more sustainable method of eternal damnation.
He just hasn't been the same since hell froze over.
Quit complaining, at least its not Fox News
And now, back to 'The Apprentice'
This is the part where he says, “You’re fired”
Yeah, it's been like this since we ran out of fossil fuels for the brimstone.
Ironically, it's the Yule Log.
I thought it would be a little more hands on.
I always hate the coming attractions.
Do you have any plans after the show?
We got naked for this?
So, this is Trump TV.
You think this is bad? This time last week I was at Mar-a-Lago.
I voted for Jill Stein in Michigan. Why are you here?
Hell, I hate reality TV.
Welcome to the United States Immigration Process.
“Naked and Afraid” is quite popular here.
" Has to be better than a Sarah Huckleberry Sanders News / Press Conference".
Spoiler Alert: It doesn't get better.
It's not the worst timeshare presentation I've been to.
We’ll have a real one when Trump gets here.
I would’ve been more diligent if I’d known eternity was without cable.
So, probably no wifi either...
Are all the TVs tuned to Fox?
When we get to the next layer, they read us his tweets.
C'mon, rabbit ears? I really am in Hell.
At least it's not a White House press briefing.
I hate when the previews give everything away.
a nice fire, enjoying it in the nude----this must be heaven.
Oh, Hell. Eternal reruns.
What! No cable! Oh hell!
Great. We finally get a TV down here and he leaves it set on the Yule log channel.
I'm just relieved that it's not Fox News
This is just the warm up.
The only channel we can get is Fox.
He's had to give up using fossil fuels.
I'm going to get some popcorn and forbidden fruit juice, you want anything?
Heeeyyy ... the women have breasts but none of the men have penises! This MUST be Hell!
Wait til the millennials get here and don't know what horizontal hold is.
Why do we even bother watching the weather channel?
This does seem pretty severe for using my neighbors Netflix account.
"I'm going to Korea" he said. "What could go wrong" he said...
Well, at least it's not "Roseanne".
This orientation video is so boring. I wish they'd just let us in.
He calls it reality TV.
Considering where we are, I would have expected Fox and Friends.
666 channels and nothin' on.
What’d I miss.
Coming attractions.
If I had known there was no cable, I would have been a better person.
And we still have to pay $149 a month for it.
The damned today are so detached from perdition. Back in the day, we had to stand IN the flames.
If I knew this was it, I would have cheated on my wife and my taxes.
Apparently new regulations force them to show us this instructional video before they get to the actual burning.
Hannity's up next!
What are you doing after orientation?
Six hundred and sixty-six channels and nothing on
You think this is torture? It's just the screensaver before Fox News comes on.
I hate reality shows.
And you said there was no way in hell anybody could cancel Comcast.
I honestly thought it would be warmer.
I heard the people upstairs have Netflix.
You'd think the the first circle would have better reception.
No cable and it’s black and white. This place is worse than I thought.
I heard that in the seventh circle, they have it tuned to Fox News.
We're in hell's the remote?
Wow. Looks like we left Earth just in time.
Has anyone tried changing the channel?
I hear the Fifth Circle has a flat screen.
At least it's a dry heat.
I was worried it would be tuned to Fox News.
Safety video. Oh he's good.
Since they outsourced hell, the punishment hasn't been the same.
This is it? No clothes. No cable.
I expected no hope, not no cable.
Hot and naked? I think I've died and gone to heaven.
Whoa! I didn't know The New Yorker could show boobs.
You would think the Prince of Darkness could afford a flat screen.
I was dying to see this show. Now I’m not so sure.
I should have guessed the first abomination of hell would be an orientation video.
'No cable? Yes, we are in hell'
I like it better on screen than in person...
Is it just me, or does it seem like this show lasts for an eternity?
I guess in this case ending up in the overflow room isn't so bad.
I would have lived a better life if I knew there was no cable
It's a prequel to Dante.
He won't get cable—something about Comcast being too evil.
I'm just thankful this is my last orientation meeting ever.
The rules for these White House press briefings have become humiliating.
Yes, we’ve been waiting forever for the cable guy to get here.
I knew I’d run into some old flames down here but this is ridiculous.
I hear heaven has HD and flat screens.
He says this is the largest audience, period.
Welcome to Heck.
...and every day from 6 to 9 he makes us stand here and watch Fox News.
Forecast calls for flame.
I didn’t see seasons one through six-thousand, but it’s surprisingly easy to follow.
For real? The Weather Channel.
It's a closed circuit feed. The main room is full. Not that I'm complaining.
Breaking News: Global warming is not fake news.
It froze over.
We're reducing our carbon footprint.
A black and white portable with rabbit ears! Welcome to hell.
All they play down here is election coverage.
Coincidentally, I think I'm here because of a night a lot like this one.
The book's better.
Whatever you do, don't fart.
Welcome to orientation.
It was this or The 700 Club.
I hear in the 7th circle of hell they put the flames to accordion music.
I thought there'd be more gays.
I dare you to change it to the Snow Channel
Casual Fryday.
What did I miss?
The real punishment is that there's no remote.
In Life, I had 100s of channels to watch and no friends. Now, I have one and I'm surrounded by naked people. Despite eternal damnation, I consider this a win."
The reception down here is surprisingly good.
I’ve heard the 2nd season sucks.
It feels like we’ve had to watch this for an eternity.
It really doesn't compare to experiencing it live.
Rabbit ears, really?!?! You'd think there'd be at least one cable installer down here.
He said it might not be the hell we want but it's the hell we all deserve
Too bad we can't clear this place out by yelling 'fire'.
I should have had WAY more fun up there.
Maybe Hell is not being able to change the channel.
Oh no, he's making us watch another one of his crappy home videos.
Wow, I wish I'd known we were only in for virtual hell.
I asked him to change the channel but all he said was “Hell, no!”
It only picks up local programming.
This is the waiting room. He thinks it's funny.
They're trying to lower their carbon footprint.
It's just the coming attractions.
It's a decent adaptation but I thought the book was better.
Why did we have to get naked for this?
I hate this episode.
For how much longer do you think Satan is going to make us watch this Trump press conference?
Who knew that the cable companies were owned and operated by Satan.
Is this supposed to be actual or virtual Hell?
You want HDTV? Where the Hell do yo think you are?
Rabbit ears! The Time Warner merger must have gone through.
Oh I’ve seen it before, it’s the re-run from Hell.
My favorite flame is coming up next! It has a little tinge of green to it.
We get to watch this whenever this place ‘freezes over.
Orientation video
Hell Inc. has been ordered to reduce it's carbon footprint.
That's just the coming attraction.
It will really be hell if they start showing Roseanne re-runs.
We used to wanna watch Fox News. Now we have to.
The Fox and Friends Marathon is next!
Trust me, it's better than live.
I heard this is just the warm-up--we watch Fox News for the rest of eternity.
Do we have to stand through the entire orientation?
There are a lot more white people here than I was expecting.
If I had known how backwards the TV programming and technology are down here, I would have thought twice about coveting you.
No, it's too late to say you believe in global warming now.
At first, Fox News was on, but then the Devil thought it was too much for him.
Honestly? Not the worst house warming party I’ve been to...
I thought I was safe. I voted for Hilary.
It'll be a cold day in hell before we get cable.
There's a special place in Hell for hogging the remote.
It's nice to have a break from the brimstone channel.
And, he's got the remote for eternity!
Zenith. How ironic.
Remember when you said......"it would be a cold day in hell.
The word is we're getting cable when hell freezes over.
Because real flames are a fire hazard.
So listen up! All that "fire and brimstone" stuff -- fake news.
I knew it! All RERUNS!
It was either this or reruns of The Apprentice.
Don't tell me how it ends.
Next time let ME pick the resort.
Hell froze over a while back and the reception has been terrible ever since.
I brought the marshmallows. Just need to borrow his fork.
I hear that in the Ninth Circle it's Fox and Friends 24-7
The other channel is brimstone.
Brimstone comes on next.
It gets worse. This is just orientation.
I didn't expect an orientation video.
I heard the price of real fire and brimstone has gone through the roof.
Well, at least Hannity's not on.
I know it's just an orientation video, but I pictured things being much more hellish.
At Christmastime there's a log on the fire.
Trump decided all the TVs have to play Fox News.
In heaven, they have flat screen tvs and cable.
It's only heaven if you were Norwegian.
Where's Donald?
These orientation videos are always so predictable.
At least it's not Fox & Friends.
Do you think God knows that Satan is using His Netflix account?
At least they let me keep my Glasses...
Isn't this Scandinavian heaven?
The cable repair window is between 8 am and eternity.
Even in Hell you can't escape the news from the White House.
You come here often?
Don’t worry, these orientation videos always make things out to be way worse than they really are.
Isn't that our old Zenith?
Wait until you see the Brimstone channel!
I liked the book better.
I'm so glad that we can get Fox News down here.
Should I ask him to change the damned channel?
Whaddya say we skip the orientation and just go straight in?
Don’t forget the camera adds 400 degrees.
We got naked to watch this?
Is it hot down here, or is it you?
Welcome to the "Hell For Dummies" workshop.
I hate these mandatory HR trainings.
Just our luck, a hemorrhoid commercial on a loop for all eternity.
Only one channel, this really is hell.
Really? Virtual Hell?
How can the heat wave be 'breaking news' every day?
I heard it's been renewed for another ten million seasons.
Wait...you worked at Fox too?
The cable guy is scheduled to arrive between 9 a.m. and eternity. Until then, we only get public access channels.
Oh, really? I worked for Fox News too!
Seriously ? A review of fire safety regs for new arrivals !
Everybody naked and watching tv instead of an orgy? What kind of hell is this?
It's Fox News 24-7.
Things sure have changed since Roger Ailes arrived.
It could be worse.... in the 3rd Circle, they make them watch Fox News 24/7!
Hey, we're lucky. It's usually Fox & Friends.
Including my last marriage, this is my second virtual hell.
Damned right this is hell. That's a Sony Trinitron from 1996.
Be grateful; I hear in the ninth circle they make them watch THE NEWS.
I can't believe it's only Monday--feels like an eternity.
I'll be damned, I always thought this is where Fox News was born.
I really like his devil-may-care attitude.
It's really hell when you don't have cable.
He said reruns of "The Apprentice" start in half an hour.
No! I did NOT touch your ass!
And then the Brimstones are on at 8.
Heaven has cable.
I dare you to change the channel
It's a sting. The invitation said "swingers" weekend.
Analogue?! Now I know it’s hell.
After orientation, do you want to get a drink?
Welcome to Phoenix. Where are you from?
My definition of hell has always been losing the remote
'Serves us right for answering that "free vacation" robo call.'
It wouldn't be hell without reruns.
I hear they have premium cable in Heaven.
Reality TV...? This really is hell.
Analog TV and no remote? I guess you're right, we are in hell.
He calls it singe-watching.
He has the remote, but God has the batteries.
No high-def? What the hell?
Last week they made us watch the news.
You expected more than one channel?
I TOLD you not to vote for him! Welcome to hell!
Who knew they'd make you watch a video tutorial on how to suffer eternal damnation?
Im hoping its fake news
Somehow I thought watching TV with our clothes off would be more fun.
...and, thanks to relaxed EPA regulations, BRIMSTONE IS BACK!
Well, I always did think that whole "flames of hell" thing was allegorical.
Orientation is always so awkward
There's nothing but reality TV down here.
This must be hell, I've seen this episode like a hundred times.
I've seen this show before, believe me it doesn't end well.
Remember how we used to see snow when the signal was bad...
You're right. It is worse in Washington.
Come here often ?
The only other channel they get down here is Fox News.
I feel like we’ve been watching the same show for an eternity.
But in high def, you think you can feel the heat.
Hopefully this video will answer all your burning questions.
At least we don't have to watch slides from his vacation.
After seeing the Sistine chapel, this is not at all what I was expecting.
Sean Hannity must be on vacation.
It's not working. I still feel cold.
So, you're into fashion and high-definition cable TV. Welcome to hell.
He's getting soft ... it is usually Fox News.
I always thought the flames of Hell would be painful, but painfully boring might be worse.
Amazing how far Trump's budget cuts are reaching.
Well, we know where the remote ISN'T…
Welcome to a kindler, gentler Hell.
Thank Heavens we still get the Weather Channel down here.
Black and white. No remote. No cable. This is going to be hell.
Tomorrow's weather forecast.
It's a repeat.
At least we don’t have to hear about Trump’s tweets anymore
Ugh, another time share presentation.
These old TVs, they only get local stations.
Do you think this was shot on location?
It's his new show 'As the World Burns'. It's the hottest thing on Hellavision.
I hope the torture isn’t as medieval as the technology.
Rabbit ears. We really are damned.
TV is fine, but it doesn't really capture the live experience, does it?
This isn't so bad. I'm actually kind of glad I killed my mother-in-law now.
The first class assholes get rooms with real fire.
You would think he could afford cable.
Have you seen the remote?
It's not eternal... it's just a loop.
This show seems like an eternity.
At least it’s not Hannity.
Spoiler alert: it gets worse
I hear the coffee's still room temperature
The Devil does not wear Prada - welcome to reality TV
Don't worry. It is fake news!
Christmas he changes it to the Yule Log Show.
A black and white Zenith with rabbit ears and no remote! What more hell can we endure?
And he lets us stay up as late as we want.
Eh, the book was better
Glad we made it out of the US...
It doesn't have quite the same effect, but I hear he's saving a fortune on gas.
I love this scene.
I TOLD you Fox news was going to burn in hell.
Black and white! Tube! Rabbit ears! Is there no end to their cruelty?
We must be in the overflow room.
All we ever get is the Fireplace Channel.
Ive seen this one.
Don't blame me. I voted for Hillary.
Rabbit ears and analog. We really ARE in Hell!
Turns out the only actual burning down here is the chlamydia.
Welcome, contestants, to the final season of "Survivor'.
Why does he always get to choose the channel?
I knew Hell would be a timeshare presentation.
And the phones are rotary.
Seriously, the overflow room? The old TV, the crowding. It's all going in my Yelp review.
Wait, everyone here was a Nielsen family? Small world, isn't it!
No cable, no high-definition, no big screen, no remote. This is hell.
Fancy seeing an old flame here.
Watching the fireplace channel for eternity may be hell, but it sure beats watching Trump.
I know his art films seem bad, but trust me, his poetry is the real torture.
At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I'm a little disappointed.
The first season was better.
What's puzzling me is the nature of his game.
Damn it! I've seen this one.
I guess they were right. There is a special place in Hell for TV Satellite executives.
The devil just said, "What you see on the screen is virtual hell. The real hell is other people."
Hey, turns out there really is a special place in hell for people who spoil movies!
It was either this or reruns of The Apprentice.
I love movie night.
Don't worry. The camera adds 100 degrees.
I never thought I would miss ads for hemorrhoid cream.
The only other channel is Fox News.
I guess we're all about to feel the burn.
It’s still better than ‘Keeping Up With The Karashians’.
Another orientation video? You've got to be kidding me.
I would have been a better person if I knew I’d be stuck watching standard definition for eternity.
I can’t believe we have to watch a safety video first.
Rabbit ear antenna, we must be in Hell!
I hate reality TV.
Network TV and Rabbit Ears! This Is Hell!
Only one channel? This is Hell!
Isn't this a rerun?
Could be worse. I heard Circle Nine only gets Fox News.
It’s okay, I guess. I just wish it was more like the book.
It kinda takes the fun out of all of us being naked.
Shortest orientation I've ever seen
I can take the heat, but these White House press conferences are murder.
I murdered my entire family for this?
Hi, I'm Phil. I like to think of myself as a devil may care sort of guy.
It's fake news — that's all we get down here.
It's worse than I imagined! No color, no sound, no cable.
Looks like they have Comcast down here, too.
I agree, pledge week is torture.
Well I’ll be damned... Rabbit Ears!
I didn't think hell would be so... ironic.
It may cost me an eternity, but I still say, "The book was better".
No wonder this Airbnb was so cheap.
I think it's a rerun.
This is a rerun, the real fire went out centuries ago.
The program is okay but nobody can act to save their soul.
I got burned on a similar time-share two years ago.
I missed last week’s episode; what happened?
It's The Sean Hannity Show. 24/7 for Eternity.
we're in analog hell...
This is the hellfire...Hannity's on at 9:00 for the brimstone.
What do you say we slip out for a cold one?
Limited channels, but excellent reception.
To be fair it’s his first film, but I agree it’s a little obvious.
Brimstone is not nearly as frightening in black-and-white.
That damn pitchfork is screwing up the reception
When I said those fireplace videos were my version of Hell I didn't think anyone was listening.
This is not how I pictured it.
Due to budget cuts you must watch Hell instead of living in it
We're okay. You can tell this is only Purgatory. No advertisements.
Travelogs always make the place look way better then it is.
So, it really is just other people.
I sure hope that’s just a TV Yule log !!
On Tuesdays we get reruns of 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo'.
At least in purgatory we had high definition.
I hear in heaven they're watching The Ten Commandments.
You must be new here, we haven't had real fire since 2013. Now we just stream Netflix and and chill.
They say the camera adds 10 degrees
It's pretty much the same forecast every day.
The Weather Report says it will be hot as hell tomorrow
I guess this is the origin of that fireplace log video.
I know this is important, but I wonder if you're busy later.
You were a co-host of 'Fox and Friends,' too?
Damn. Another infernal commercial.
Rabbit ears and a CRT? What kind of a hell-hole is this anyways?
For $19.95 a month, you get 666 channels.
The screen-saver from Hell
They say this is the birthplace of reality TV.
Yes, in fact I did play the devil's advocate...I was an attorney for Donald Trump.
Well, I'll be damned --- the cooking channel!
They’ve lost some of the ambiance, but it’s much better for air quality.
I gotta say the reception down here is better than I expected...
Cutbacks.
If you wanted cable, you would have had to lead a much better life.
I don't want a timeshare either, but we don't get the buffet tickets until after the presentation.
Look on the bright side, it could be Fox News.
I'm sorry. That really was my hand.
They do switch to Hannity at 10.
I heard that, in the 5th circle, they let you watch the flames from an app on your phone.
Apparently the only other channel is Fox News.
..I thought this would be a more immersive experience.
At least the news is the same down here.
I get the whole eternal damnation thing, but does Satan really need to hog the remote?
It's hell when he controls the remote
How did I know that they would only get FOX news?
I hate reality programming.
The real torture? He keeps repeating that "hell-evision" joke.
Having to watch Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway for Eternity....Why do you think they call this HELL
At least it's commercial-free.
At least now I know why they let me keep my glasses.
At least there are no commercials.
Thank God. We are finally free of all the Religious nut jobs.
Welcome to hell for millenials!
I didn't sin as much as I did just to end up watching shitty tv.
On Tuesdays we get to watch paint dry.
I'm going to ask him if we can put the game on, just this once.
It’s better than watching Fox.
Rabbit ears? This MUST be Hell.
An analog TV and only one channel? These guys are damned good at this Hell thing.
I love movie night.
I bet in heaven it's a flat screen.
Now that it's frozen over, do you think they'll give us coats?
Since Hell froze over on November 8, 2016, there are only fake flames.
That concludes the orientation. Please exit on the left into the flames, and remember: don't swim in the lake of fire after eating.
Hannity's coming on.
Doesn't he know this would be more evil on Facebook live-stream?
Yes, it's PBS. But, it could have been reruns of The Apprentice!
The commercials are worse.
It's just a preview of coming attractions.
It appears we're in Hell's green room
Why are waiting room televisions always tuned to Fox News?
Hell is apparently now on earth, so they are providing us with video.
I hate documentaries.
Well, at least it's not reruns of "The Apprentice"
I bet they have a flat screen in heaven.
You know what's worse? The remote's missing.
Due to funding cuts, eternal torment has been outsourced to Capita.
This is hell - analog tv with no remote!
Have I missed anything?
I heard the book's better
Ugh, I've seen this safety video a thousand times.
It’s either this or FOX.
I knew this was going to be avant-garde, but Jerry, give me one good reason why we're naked.
I found this tour on Groupon.
Yes, this is hell. Heaven has a flat screen with 600 channels of cable.
I know I shouldn't complain, but I was expecting something more interactive.
Do you still think watching the promotional video for a free stay was a good idea?
Uh-oh, it's a cooking show.
Talk about the orientation from hell.
I thought the Trump Channel was only on cable.
I heard he's trying to lower his carbon footprint.
There's a 30 minute orientation on fire and brimstone followed by a hot lunch.
It's true . . . I always hated those fake fireplaces
We're "virtually" burning in hell...
He signed on to the Paris Climate Accord.
It's Lucifer's remake of the classic "Some Like It Hot"
It'll be an eternity until they upgrade to cable.
I don’t know about you, but I was expecting real flames
I hear they have cable upstairs.
It's nice, but I miss the searing heat.
I saw this one in the theaters. You don't see the end coming.
It's either this or Fox News.
It's nice to get some news from the world above.
It's the Weather Channel.
Please watch this safety video before we proceed to the river Styx.
Black and white TV? Now I know we're in hell!
I heard the previews last forever.
It’s perpetually Episode 1 Season 1. Get used to it.
Did I miss anything?
I assume he doesn't realize that this is less torturous than 24 hours of Fox News.
Apparently hell means no diversity.
The first circle is just black and white.
The Weather Channel is monotonous here.
It's not so much the heat as the humidity
If I'd known this was all it was going to be, I'd have killed a LOT more people.
12” screen, rabbit ears and only 1 channel; this really is hell!
You could say we are comfortably dressed for the occasion.
Things have gotten much better down here since we went virtual.
And I thought daytime TV was hell.
You gotta give the devil his due. It is more environmentally friendly.
"This is hell, it's stuck on the local weather channel".
Reruns.
I miss fake news.
Rabbit ears? In 2018? Really?
I love previews!
Don't worry, these presentations exaggerate everything. I used to sell timeshares.
I guess we're not freezing over anytime soon.
I found the book to be a lot more compelling.
Hey, turns out there really is a special place in hell for people who spoil the ending!
I've never been a fan of Reality TV.
This is just the warm-up. Next is "Keeping Up with the Kardashians."
Hannity'll be on after the informercial
After the safety video, I’ll need you to sign the liability waiver.
I was expecting fire and brimstone, not "Fox and Friends."
I think it would look better in color --- just sayin.
Ah...to set the mood, I guess...
When does the State of the Union address start?
The hellfire is just virtual? Wow, if I'd known that, I would have done a whole lot more sinning.
This really is hell. We liberals get only Fox New forever while the conservatives get all of PBS.
Steve's cock is smaller than I'd pictured.
Can we switch to the airconditioning channel?
I heard in Purgatory they get Dish TV and HBO.
This year's Burning Man is on a whole other level
I wonder what it did to end up down here
Damned if I know.
You were in entertainment litigation? So was I!
At least they have FOX News down here....
Rabbit ears?!? I knew there was a special place in hell reserved for those!
Oh great, I've seen this one.
My cousin on the level below says they're showing season two of "The Jersey Shore"
I hear we have to watch all the ads down here, too.
I'm so tired of reality TV
I heard next week we start getting "Cosby Show" reruns.
Who would have believed the Scientologists were right?
AND there is no remote control
He waits until we're late into each episode before he spoils the ending.
Who knew my punishment in hell would be watching the burning log channel for eternity?
It's either this or reruns of Sean Hannity.
Yes, I heard this happens when you try to get out of your cable contract.
Last season was way better
The news doesn't look any different down here.
No cable and no flatscreens. Well... I guess we’re really here.
It's one of their original series.
Thank goodness we still get Fox News
It's called HELLevision!
Oh, hey Susan.
Reception is good here.
The nudity is a surprise, but it's still hell without a remote.
It was this or Fox and Friends.
A cathode ray TV, of course this is Hell.
If you think this is hell, just wait for the infomercial!
Didn’t I see you at the innaugaration?
Finally. He promised he'd be here to install it in 1956.
Well, at least there are no commercials.
Roseanne is on next.
Orientation is so boring. Let's get started already. Right?
Oh good. We can see "Fox and Friends"
Welcome to Hell. After you finish watching the informative video, you will have a chance to use the sauna.
The commentator said the definition of hell is nudity over forty.
I haven’t seen rabbit ears for eternity.
Worst.Timeshare.Promo.Ever.
Only the big sinners get to be there in person.
It's just a preview of coming attractions.
Orientations are Hell.
This is the tenth circle of Hell - political junkies. We are condemned to watch local C-SPAN for eternity.
No remote....
Don't you miss marshmallows?
Coming Attractions! Isn't that a little over the top?
I don't mind the overflow room.
And you thought reality TV was hell before we died.
Let's offer him our souls in exchange for cable.
I hear there's a hot tub in every room.
24-hour Fox News. Who knew.
They say TV adds 10 degrees.
God warned Eve not to get an Apple TV but she just had to get one, didn't she?
We got him off coal but going solar is gonna be an uphill battle.
We get real fire only when Hell starts to freeze over. Otherwise, it's just reruns.
It's not the heat -- it's the morbidity.
There's no chance we'll get a snowy picture.
So the Devil does NOT wear Prada?
My ministry swindled enough people of their life savings to afford this upgrade. And you?
Black and White with rabbit ears, this must be hell
The road to hell is paved with fake news.
I heard if Satan doesn't show up in the first 15 minutes you can leave.
The only thing worse than Hell is this orientation video.
This is pure hell. It's the same on every channel.
I dare you to change the channel
0h, no --another Oval Office meltdown!
Hey, turns out there really is a special place in hell for people who spoil movies!
So ... are you here for eternity ... or ...
There was a much better selection of channels in purgatory.
Who here thinks this is fake news?
Whaaat? Black and white? This is hell!
In heaven you get to change the channel.
Can we move closer? I'm still cold.
I’ve never been a fan of the coming attractions.
Thank Satan we don't have to watch any more cat videos.
It could be worse. They could be showing 'Hannity'.
Rabbit ears? We’re in heaven...Hell has 800 cable channels but nothing’s on....
They were right it did go to hell.
Do you think it would be rude if I asked to change the channel?
Fox News is all they can get here
Yes, we are in the real Hell, rabbit ears reception on a Black and White TV
Another orientation meeting? Boy, this place really is Hell
This may sound stupid, but I can't help but feel disappointed.
The only other two channels are a burning fireplace and Billy Graham.
Spoiler alert.
So it's going to be an eternity of watching the Yule Log channel?
Looks like McLuhan was right - the medium is the message.
Last season was better...
(Sigh) So it’s true. All they have down here is the Hallmark channel.
It's the 13495738293584635th season and they will never cancel it.
It’s Purgatory ... with benefits.
Firefox. How ironic.
But it's a dry heat.
It's the preview of what's next.
Just to let you know, the weather reports here are totally predictable.
No cable or satellite. This really is hell!
We're lucky, I heard that if you were really bad they make you watch "The View".
Now first, we're going to watch a short video about our sexual harassment policies here.
The only show we get is the Hawaiian lava flow.
This is Dante's sixth level of hell. They make us watch FOX News.
You all said "over hell or high water" you'd support the president, well, guess what?
They're working on getting a live feed from the White House.
First level: black and white. Next level, no remote. Third, remotes for each of us.
It's more fuel efficient.
Let's hope this Inferno thing is just one season.
It feels like we’ve been waiting an eternity for the cable guy to show up.
I can deal with the heat. Having to watch Hannity on an endless loop is the real torture.
Who knew that the ads would still be the worst part.
This focus group sucks.
‘That’s the power of prayer for you,Fox News went to Hell.’
I remember White House press briefings a bit differently.
Here comes the safety video
Brimstone shortage. It's all digital now.
Turns out, the road to hell was paved with bad reality TV.
”It looks so much hotter in the ad”.
It’s hell. Only reality TV.
This is a rerun.
I knew it. Eternal Fox news.
Worse yet, it's reruns.
And now for a brief message from our sponsor.
It's not what I would call 'binge-worthy.'
Notice how they're showing more boobs in The New Yorker?
This is the hottest show on tv.
If money is the root of all evil you'd think they could afford HDTV.
I had no idea hell meant I'd have to watch fox news forever.
It's either this or re-runs of "The Apprentice".
We're toast!
The cable installer said he would come when hell freezes over.
The worst part is there’s no remote.
Reality TV producer? Me, too!
Must be a preview of coming attractions.
I hate reality shows.
Fake news.
Well, at least the news is better.
I never pay attention to orientation videos
At least down here the weather report is accurate.
They call this hell?!? I used to be in charge of Trump's tweets!
What the hell? Does he ever let anyone else choose what to watch?
Is this Channel 666?
Art really does imitate life.
One tv station was always my vision of hell.
My wife told me I'd end up here if I kept watching porn videos. Guess I got the last laugh.
Previews of coming attractions
This is Naked and Afraid. Truth or Consequences is in studio B.
It gets worse, the only other channel is Fox News.
I know it's hell, but still...rabbit ears??
Looks like Trump stiffed the cable company again.
Looks like we only get the Hellmark Channel down here.
This isn't the worse part. Wait until you see the commercials.
When I said I wanted to heat things up in the bedroom, this isn't what I had in mind.
I wonder if they have flat screens in heaven.
Fox and Friends has gone to hell lately.
Better reception than I expected.
An analog TV? What kind of hell is this?
It’s the only way he can get Baby Boomers to pay attention.
An eternity of watching the Yule Log on an old Philco. Who knew?
It lowers our carbon footprint.
Are you sure this is the right Burning Man?
At least there's no commercials.
Rumor is that it streams live on all 666 channels.
He knew about global warming centuries ago.
I'm late to the orientation - did they already give out the wi-fi password?
I expected Fox News.
What time does Hannity start?
Welcome to hell, where your only news source for all eternity is Fox News! Muahahaha!
That’s right, no flatscreens for you sinners.
I usually skip orientation.
The whole fire and brimstone thing loses its effect when you are watching the live feed here in the overflow room
No cable, no flat screen ... this is hell.
Sure, it’s not bad so far but I think this is just the orientation video
I can't believe this show got picked up for a 74,853th season.
It's the sequel to Liar Liar. It's called Pants on Fire.
After age 40, nudity is hell.
They say it's just a preview of what's to come.
The only problem is, it’s either this, Fox News, or the Home Shopping Network.”
Wow, Great to see you here.
According to the weather report, it will be hot like hell for the foreseeable future.
No remote, no hi-def , no flat screen : I’m starting to get it.
And if we sign up today, we get one free week at any Trump property worldwide.
When I said those fireplace videos were my vision of Hell I didn't think anybody was listening.
Fake News. Let’s go to the beach.
It's in SD -- slow damnation.
We're spillover in Hades2. The 1% are getting actual fire and brimstone.
I wish I'd never invented reality TV.
He said to watch closely. The devil is in the details
He’s very pleased. Nothing but Kilauea on every channel.
No cable, no remote- this really IS Hell.
Frankly, I'm getting tired of reality TV.
Damn! I would have been a better person if Revelation had warned about an eternity of Reality TV instead of just the whole 'fiery lake of burning sulfur' thing.
Oh, great--an eternity of black & white TV
Only C-SPAN? We really are in hell.
Press Briefing.
These orientation videos bore the hell out of me
And now, your Local on the 8s. Chance of hellfire 100%
"You said you'd only see me again when Hell freezes over".
Wow... It feels so real.
Due to recent budget constraints, we will only be offering simulated hellfire for the next quarter.
Wait. Fox News comes on next.
24/7 reality TV?! This is going to be hell alright.
20 minutes of previews and it already seems like an eternity.
Apparently the energy costs were just killing them.
The good news is you can watch as much TV as you want...
I knew it wasn't going to be plush, but seriously, no cable?
It could be worse, it could be reality T.V.
In purgatory, they're still waiting for the cable guy.
Every time I see this show, it's always the same episode. It's like being in Limbo or something.
What are you doing after orientation?
At least it's not the Big Bang Theory again...
For these folks, hell is the endless reoccurring epiphany of discovering that Fox News is actually broadcast from hell.
The eternal fire was just too expensive.
The ad said “Hot Weather- Great Reception” so who knew ?
So, got any plans after the show?
Fire and brimstone on a large screen would be bad enough, but having to watch it for eternity on that thing is really hell!
Orientation videos are the worst, right?
At least it's less of a disaster than the White House.
The first person to complain about not having cable reincarnates as White House Press Secretary.
Let's find a cool place to make out after this video is over.
Trailers these days always seem to give away the ending.
I still think things would have turned out worse if Hillary had won.
Last year we had a flat screen LED. Everything’s just going to hell.
No flatscreen TV? Well, this is hell.
Gosh, GOP really DOES have 'a Special Place in Hell'!
At least we're not watching golf.
It’s still better than ‘Keeping Up With The Karashians’.
Never thought I’d spend eternity reliving the 60’s.
I know it feels fine, but Fox News says it's scorching hot down here, so it must be true.
Hi, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ?
Did you remember to turn off the stove?
You know, the camera adds a few degrees.
We’re being forced to watch ‘Apprentice’ reruns for all eternity.
If I knew there was no HBO, I would have been a lot nicer up there.
Must be election season again.
You come here often?
These welcome to newcomers videos are so lame.
Somehow, this is even worse.
I'm not really interested in a timeshare. I just wanted the free trip.
This is the easy part. The live Trump rally coverage airs in five minutes.
Somehow I'm not surprised that the only channel we get here is reality T.V.
Finally! True news. Who thought we'd get it here?
Waiting for Hannity.
I thought Hell would be to watch the Kardashians over and over again
When do you think people will catch on that they are watching 'fake hell'.
Looks like another scorcher to day.
Which season are we on?
It's either this or C-SPAN.
Could've been worse, Florence. I mean, at least it's not Fox News.
Should I ask to use his trident to see if we can pick up a few more channels?
Not even a flatscreen TV. We really are in hell.
I thought hellfire would be bad, but it's the endless safety videos that really get you.
You can't trust everything you see on TV anymore... I heard hell froze over last year.
Don't complain or he will switch it to coverage of Trump.
Well, no worries about our clothes catching fire!
I guess he's really going to make us watch the royal wedding from beginning to end.
Is this your first Burning Man vacation tour?
And he only lets us watch the Weather Channel.
Good thing we died and got out of America just in time.
It could be worse - we could be watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
You just knew it would be reality tv.
I’ve seen this one before. But then I have been here for two hundred years.
Let’s start screaming in agony—we don’t want them catching on that we’re really just fine without HDTV.
Thank Satan they finally turned off the Royal Wedding!
There is only one station and it's Hell.
Somehow, I expected it would be "live."
In the next scene hell freezes over.
He said ‘to hell with cable !’
White Supremacist Convention.
Well what did you expect, HBO?
It's a state-run network.
What's worse is still having to pay for all those other channels...
So, is this your first time visiting Florida?
Could be worse. On the level below us all they get is C-SPAN.
Oh hell, Rabbit Ears, really?
No Netflix? This is going to be hell.
'He likes to begin with a short travelogue.'
I hear the seventh circle has high-def.
If they really wanted to punish us, they would've put on cable news.
Apparently, Keeping Up With the Kardashians was considered inhumane.
And I thought watching the yule log channel at Christmas on my big screen was hell....
What’s a women like you doing in a place like this?
I should have done more sins
I love our mandatory Fox News breaks.
666 channels and there's still never anything good on.
I dare you to start caroling.
I was a producer for reality TV. How about you?
I just *knew* The Inferno was fake news.
He told me no judicial experience was necessary for the appointment....you too?
Hmmm, never mind the TV; I always thought he'd be bigger, you know, down there.
Watching television via antennae? Even hell doesn't force us to use Comcast.
American education IS dead, if he needs a video to explain who he is.
Analog TV, local channels only and no remote, now this is Hell!
Alright kids, Mr. Lucifer has jury duty, so we'll be watching a movie today.
The orientation video doesn't do it justice.
Cathode ray and rabbit ears - this place is worse than I'd thought.
This is the most interesting orientation I've been to. Mostly because of the nudity.
Season 4,643,342 was better
Not watching in high definition is the first eternal torment.
Before the budget cuts, they at least used actual fire.
Wow, they get great reception down here.
Could be worse. Remember the Yule log?
Can you believe it over 500 channels and that's all the hell that's on.
The sub always makes us watch a video of our damnation. It's just lazy tormenting.
Hell is freezing over. What did you expect?
What in hell is that supposed to mean?
It's better than looking at Facebook all day...
I so hate orientation videos.
It's worse than I thought. No cable.
I’m surprised they get any reception down here.
I just heard it's going to be replaced by Hannity's show.
I bet Heaven has HD.
You know, I hear in Heaven they got 200 more channels than we do.
Hey, at least it isn't Fox News.
At least it’s better than the room where you spend eternity waiting for the cable technician.
It's hell all right--no A.C. and you only get one channel.
On the next level down they have Facebook.
Remember back when there was more than one channel?
Guess it's not really a surprise that Satan has Comcast.
Where’s the remote?
Winter is not coming.
Look around, this special place in Hell is for the White House press corps.
If you think this is bad, you should have seen last year's pledge drive.
Everyday, it's either this or Fox News.
Everything looks worse in black and white.
It's a very short orientation video
The fire is fake, but the cattle prod is real.
At least it’s not Fox...!
Is this because I told my cable company to go to hell?
No High Def. Told you this was Hell.
You would think the King of Darkness could afford satellite.
At least it's not "The View."
Do you ever wish for clothes captioning?
Yeah, maybe we shouldn’t have voted yes for net neutrality.
All the shows are sindicated.
No cable, one channel, this must be Hell.
Last episode, Sisyphus was voted off.
This is the first time I've felt lucky to be in the overflow room.
What's with the rabbit ears? I'd swear my cable bundle included hell in the package.
I see what you mean by 'cult classic.'
This must be hell - there’s no remote.
Normally we watch dumpster fires, but this white house press briefing is pretty hot
At least it isn't a bunch of stupid cat videos.
It's the only show we get here and it was just renewed for an eternity of seasons.
I love this part!
Hey, I've already seen this 10000 times!
We hope this brief training video has been helpful. And now, on behalf of Satan -- Welcome to Hell!
24/7 Fox News
It's just the previews.
Actually, its better than most of the network shows last season.
Oh, hell. I hear the Infernomercial takes forever.
Joke’s on him. I love reality TV.
There's just no escaping workplace safety videos.
Fox News 24/7. This is Hell!
An old black and white tube set with built in rabbit ears and one channel...yup...we’re in Hell.
I would have thought for sure they'd have Fox News here.
Like everything else, hell isn't what it used to be.
We never had TV until Trump arrived.
He's seriously reducing the carbon footprint of this place
Things changed after Comcast bought them out.
You think the commercials are bad? Wait 'til 'One Million Years of Fox and Friends" comes on!
An eternity of terrible reception.
Thanks God it's not The Bachelor.
I think this is a rerun.
It's not the reception I was expecting.
If I knew this is what they meant by burning in hell, I would've committed more crimes.
So, hell is the Yule log for eternity.
Still beats Comcast.
I'm telling you, it's got to be just a bad dream, the devil has a bellybutton.
So, someone put on Fox News and lost the remote. And now we're here.
I refuse to believe we’re in hell until they change the channel to Dr. Phil.
I think it’s the Weather Channel...
It could be worse. In heaven they have to watch reruns of "Touched by an Angel".
In hell, you still have to get up to adjust the antenna.
It's either this or brimstone.
Watching Having to watch the Yuletide Log burn forever is bad enough. But the perpetual Christmas music is sheer hell.
I knew hell would be awful, but I never dreamed that we would have to watch reality TV for eternity.
First Fake News...Now Fake Flames.
This is virtual Hell!
This is the hottest show on tv.
Look on the bright side, they could have streamed Fox News.
I heard that in the First Circle, they get to watch something other than Fox News.
Could be worse.
It's part of a new carbon neutral initiative.
Great- another local interest story.
No commercials, that’s a positive...
We used to get HBO, but this place has really gone to, well, you know.
It’s hell trying to get a signal down here
Using real fire was killing our budget.
Lacks the warmth of the original.
You'd think the Ruler of the Underworld would have a flat-screen.
Yep. We just wait for the cable guy.
This is a rerun. They think of everything.
Nice rack.
Don't worry.They change the channel every thousand years or so.
HR says we can't use real fire anymore.
I think they just want us to get warmed up.
60” flat screen back at my place. You want to get outta here?
Two thousand channels, and nothing's on.
What the Hell?
It's sweeps week for the Dante Channel.
I expected a more immersive experience from this evangelical theme park.
They finally put it down here where it belongs.
Frankly, I'm underwhelmed by the orientation so far.
A box tv? This really is Hell.
Next level down, it's Here Comes Honey Boo Boo in VR.
My parents had that TV in the '80s... it was torture to watch then too.
Oh No, just the FOX NEWS Channel down here!
It's a touch ironic since I never believed in literal fire and brimstone.
Get used to it kids... Still think global warming is a myth?
This is much more pleasant than the focus group on torture.
At least it's not C-Span.
Is it me, or does this episode seem to be lasting forever?
I didn't expect they would have Fox News here.
I’m surprised they get reception down here.
Orientation videos are always the worst.
Glad we’re in the overflow room.
Honestly, I prefer it to watching Fox News.
At least it's not snow.
I guess oil prices are effecting everyone
Trust me this is much better than when we just had radio.
Would a fake log be too much to ask?
It's not the heat I miss so much, it's the humidity.
So far, I've only abandoned all hope that we'll get to watch the playoffs.
On the bright side it looks like they have their own cable news channel.
Is there a remote chance in Hell of getting a better reception?
It's a warm-up video.
Only one screen for all of us and no cable?! What kind of place is this?!
7,500 degrees again today? And you believe Dopler Radar?
Right as the couple announces which house they'll choose he switches to this channel.
Who knew there would be hell to pay for cutting the cable.?
It’s either this or the Kardashians.
Get used to it, there's only one channel down here.
I've got a corner suite down in the 4th circle with two pals from Wharton. You have any plans for later?
Orientation is always Hell.
I'm so relieved! I always thought it was going to be Fox News.
He’s making us watch his home videos again.
That's the live stream from 666 Fifth Avenue.
Let me guess. Hot as Hell with a chance of Fire & Brimstone. Surprise, surprise.
At least there are no commercials.
In heaven it's clouds and a flat-screen.
This is the floor for Everyone Who Ever Made Fun Of The Yule Log. If you're looking for Taking Forever To Order At Starbucks, that's on six.
No streaming? This IS Hell.
Ironic don't you think--all this is heaven for an arsonist.
Don't worry - TV cameras add like 10 degrees.
These instructional videos are always so dated.
I used to think reality TV was torture.
Did you read the book?
Sure, it'll get picked up for next season. It always gets picked up for next season.
I recognize that guy from the DMV.
Heaven has a big screen with cable.
Glad I'm down here and not a White House staffer!
Somehow the heat is lost in the translation!
I’m just going to stay up until they give the forecast for the weekend...
Somehow I suspect it’s not going to be quite the same kind of ‘fireside chat’ our grandparents got from President Roosevelt.
Well, at least it's a dry heat.
The budget cuts must've hit his department the hardest
Oh we could change it - we just can’t find the remote.
No Netflix?!? Christ, this IS Hell!
It's a slight improvement from Fox & Friends.
It's almost like they named it Tinder as a warning.
Hey, so... do you come here often?
This is one hell of an orientation video.
I liked Season 1 better.
I thought at least we would be able to wear our "Make America Great Again" hats.
Down here we call it "singe-watching."
Streaming hell is cheaper these days
That women in front is pretty hot.
Wow, no flat screens. This really is hell.
These are just the previews.
You know, I think it's great the White House is bringing back fireside chats.
This is the weirdest Groupon ever.
When I sold my soul for the hottest channels on TV, this isn't what I expected!
I knew there'd be infomercials in Hell.
I can't believe they picked this up for another season.
I am the Pearly Gates when somebody asked if I'd like to get naked and watch something hot and here I am. What about you?
Do you have any plans for later?
The "hell" part is that you can't change the damned channel.
I heard St. Peter bought a 65 inch 4K Ultra HD for the upstairs rec room
Nuts! It’s a rerun.
The weather channel again?
We've been praying to find the remote for ages
... and then Trump said "You're Fired".
I was talking to Ed down on Level 3 and he said they get to have real fire.
The flames look better in HD.
I'm actually relieved-no more pharma commercials.
He is doing what he can to reduce his carbon footprint.
It's the Trump White House, on an endless loop. It makes me think we're better off here.
It’s the only reality TV show they have down here.
It's the same Trump speech over and over again.
They're trying to reduce their carbon footprint.
Really? I got naked for this?
It's apparently a live transmission of the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem.
The devil is always in the details with these cable packages.
Like hell, isn't it?
Apparently Norwegians in heaven also watch this show for all eternity
It's an EPA thing.
Don't fret over the remote, the real torment sets in when you realize we only get one channel.
Typical news it's all fire and brimstone.
ADULTERERS Anonymous ?? Confidential as AA ?? Obviously, NOT !!!
They only have this and Fox News
...and I thought Keeping Up with the Kardashians was Hell.
there used to be an actual fire but, you know...budget cuts are hell.
I hear heaven has a big screen with Netflix.
" Fox and Friends " is on in fifteen minutes!
The picture quality is so lifelike...it's the damnedest thing.
Same ol' forecast: "Mostly hot with a chance of fire and brimstone."
I've seen this one already.
This just means that when I wake up, Hannity will still be raving.
Figures he would have us watch an intro to hell on an analog tv
Nothing but Fox interrupted only by the Cars for Kids jingle. for eternity.
These commercials are hell.
I always thought there would be hell to pay for cutting cable.
We should've thought about this before we started working for Trump.
Somehow I thought we'd be wearing Prada.
I don't think the trailer does it justice.
It finally froze over.
I hear the place upstairs has a real fireplace.
I won't spoil it for you, but I know how this ends.
And they still need more evidence for global warming!!
This must be hell. There’s no cable.
So this is hell-no cable TV.
what the hell is this?
Hell is other white people.
Where in the hell is the remote?
The seventh circle is currently under construction. Please stand by.
Which Fox News show did you say you worked on?
I just watch for the commercials.
"It's a training film for those who never experienced hell on earth".
The medium is the message.
It gets worse -- at night they run nothing but informercials.
Hard to tell but it looks like a rerun
Hey, at least it's not Hannity.
The “Woman Scorned” symposium was WAY scarier.
Just a quick one. What are they going to do--punish us?
At least it's not cable news.
That's the weather channel. The usual foercast.
The laugh track is a bit over the top.
I've always hated reality TV.
The circle under this only has radio.
What the devil is going on?
Look at the TV. Rabbit ear antennae, no remote, VHF and UHF dials, no color, and one channel. OMG THIS IS HELL!!!
It’s hell without cable.
Honestly, I'm just glad they're not making us read a book.
It's better for the environment but boring as hell.
Twenty-four seven local news coverage. That's the hell of it.
Where in the hell is the remote?
This is it. One channel.
Looks like Fox News has dropped all pretense.
So ... which Hollywood executive did you represent?
Well, that looks like the hell fire. I wonder if the damnation is also virtual?
I'd sell another soul for a flat screen
... but first, a brief "Welcome to Hell" orientation video.
I heard the next season is a lot darker.
As if we didn't already know that hell is basic cable.
Don't worry this is just one of those dreams where u appear naked in public
You haven't missed anything, it's just the trailer.
I’ve seen it a million times and it still makes me laugh.
What the Hell?" "Another political rally" "This is torture!
If they show any more Hannity, I may ask to go back to the pit of flame.
Anybody seen the remote?
And you still get ads, even after you upgrade.
It's better than a lot of shows we watched when alive.
This infomercial continues until Hell freezes over.
I always said adjusting those rabbit ears was hell.
The previews are starting.
Paying the extra for the virtual hell experience was a good choice...
I told you it was worse in DC.
You think we adulterers have it bad--the murderers have to watch Full House.
You'd think we'd at least get to get FOX News down here.
Lousy reception,no Hi Def, nowhere to sit , and no AC.This really is HELL.
Actual flames are too much of a safety risk.
Fake Hell !
Trump's America and hell look pretty similar, don't you think?
In hell there is one community tv with one channel to watch & the devil is the only one who gets the tv remote; in heaven everybody gets their own tv with unlimited cable & a personalized tv remote with your initials engraved on it.
Hell of a party, isn’t it?
Rabbit ears on black-and-white TV set with only one Channel and no cable ..... we really are in Hell.
Well that answers the question...an eternity of the Channel 9 Yule Log.
To hell with it!
No spoilers please. I haven't seen this episode yet.
Yes! Finally no political commercials.
They add two years to eternity if you switch channels
Well, I'll be damned!
A CRT with rabbit ears? This is hell.
Long range forecast, expect no break from the heat and humidity.
It’s probably more breaking news.
It's hell not having cable.
No cable down here. So it's either this or PBS.
The remote doesn't work. This is the real torture.
We're trying to be more fuel efficient.
I always figured hell would involve a lot more Hannity.
Do you know if this Orientation covers the dress code?
THIS is CNN....
That TSA Screener was right! This pre-boarding process is absolute Hell!
I've seen this show before, spoiler alert.
Turn up the volume, we're freezing here!
Eco-friendly, renewable, sustainable - call it what you will; it's freezing down here.
I heard everyone in heaven gets an iPad
I can't believe that we have to watch this in black and white.
Isn't this the same news we heard yesterday?
It just hasn't been the same since the budget cuts
You think this is hell, wait till he changes the channel to reality TV.
The Yule Log isn't so bad; the 24-hour Christmas music is the real torture.
It wouldn't be half as bad down here if I hadn't left the remote in my pocket.
The next circle only has dial-up.
No cable? This IS hell!
This is what I call virtual hell.
So glad Fox News is on down here.
It's going to be hell without cable.
Summer reruns.
It's not much different than cable news, but the sick part is that you miss the commercials.
I'm just here for the free set of golf clubs you get for sitting through the presentation.
Welcome to Dante's placebo.
I've seen this one before.
Want me to tell you how it ends?
Apparently, "fire and fury like the world has never seen" plays well down here - it's on every channel.
I really thought they'd have cable.
I'm not sure about you, but these team building retreats are getting stranger and stranger...
Everything is old school down here, but considering where we are the reception is fantastic.
I bet Heaven has HD.
This freshmen orientation is making me a bit nervous.
It's the televangelists again
It's a perpetual weather channel.
It's Trump's State of the Union address.
Heaven is a 60” 4K flatscreen.
They've really lost their touch lately, but just wait 'till Gina Haspel gets down here. Then we'll see some torture.
Welcome to FOX AND FRIENDS!
It's a made for TV version of Dante's Inferno.
It's eternal reruns of the Yule log.
I’m so glad I remembered my glasses.
Purgatory was so much more interesting.
It picks up after the first season.
Could be worse, I heard the ninth circle only shows the news.
Only the worst sinners have to spend eternity without cable.
I've never been to a cable company corporate retreat before.
There's only one channel, one show, one episode, and it's all repeats.
What does it tell you about our president when even the devil is working on reducing is carbon footprint?
The book's better.
So, Hell is waiting eternity for the cable installer?
It was either the weather forecast or Fox & Friends ... the one time he actually gave us what we asked for.
The new screensaver for Fox News viewers.
Do we get clothes if Hell freezes over?
I should have known we'd all have to share the same tv, but seriously, the Weather Channel?
Wanna get something to eat before the last circle?
Oh, there is no actual ride. We just stand in line forever.
C’mon, no cable!?! That’s just inhumane!
In ten minutes we get reruns of 'The PTL Club'. Then the real Hell begins.
I guess this means we’re in Purgatory.
I sold mine for a bitcoin, what'd you sell yours for?
An eternity of watching television... this really is hell.
When the cable's out we watch the Yule Log... and the cable's always out.
I’m skeptical this global warming protest will have any impact.
I've seen this one already.
It's the yule log from hell.
I've heard it gets better after the third season.
Count yourself lucky we got purgatory; I hear hell has nothing but 24/7 cable news.
Not sure whether this is the reward--or the punishment.
My feet are cold.
Are you enjoying the reception?
I never would've guessed that Hell would have a weather channel.
This isn't so bad! I thought for orientation you had to sit through some godawful long poem.
The dammed take a quick break to watch coverage of the Trump administration...
This is Hell! No remote and rabbit ears!
Orientation is taking forever.
Rabbit ears and a CRT. This really is hell.
They only get Fox News down here.
It's the extended forecast on The Weather Channel.
The worst part is the poor image quality.
It's hell with no cable.
Frankly, I expected worse.
The only remote is upstairs.
We used to get some televangelists, but they're all down here now.
It's either this or Fox News.
This is the only reality show where you want to be the first one voted off the island.
I can’t believe it isn’t set to FOX NEWS.
New here? It's not so bad, now. They used to make us watch Maury.
Do you suppose he tapes Colbert?
It's all about reducing carbon dioxide emissions—the devil is in the details.
The frackers pumped out all the gas...
I wonder what they're watching upstairs.
Do you feel a draft..? I feel a draft.
You think we can fast-forward?
And you’ll all be issued utterly useless remotes.
Remind me again, whats the difference between a Religion and a Cult?
God, orientation week is such a bore!
This is the audition for ' Naked and Afraid', right?
I know a guy who can get us cable down here, but he's a real sleazeball.
Do you feel a draft?
It really makes you appreciate a real fire.
As soon as I saw the rabbit ears and the crummy reception, I knew I was in Hell.
This is going to be hell, no internet!
...still, it's nice that we're watching all together.
The demonic iconography would indicate this is a Catholic image, yet our genitals are angled away from the frame in a sop to Puritanical Protestant sensibilities. Also, why does this devil have a trident rather than the traditional pitchfork?
Now, where in the hell did I put the remote?!
If you want to see the corrupt politicians dunked in boiling tar, you have to subscribe to Netflix.
It's actually the power of suggestion that makes it so hot down here.
At least we've moved on from fake news to the naked truth!
I'm new here. When does the screaming part begin?
Of course this is hell ... that's an analog TV!
I hate when they show you everything in the previews.
Thank God those flames aren't real.
Evidently the televangelists were wrong about the Rapture.
Wow - no cable, satellite, or streaming; and no remote. We are in Hell!
No high definition? This really is Hell.
It’s not so much the heat as it is poor picture resolution that gets to you.
Hell has been outsourced to Fox News
I think I've already seen this episode
I guess he followed through on the whole “fire and fury” thing.
It's not so bad, it's like the Yule Log, but for the unforgiven.
At least it's not the fire place log again.
Just reruns again.
Every time a flame leaps a devil gets its horns.
Man, it feels like we've been watching the same orientation video for 1000 years.
There...right after that third crackle...that's where the tape resets.
Hey, no spoilers! I'm new here.
I think we have to bare our soul as well.
Marshall McLuhan was right - the medium is the message.
The weather report is always the same!
Budget cuts. We used to get the real thing.
Wanna get out of here?
Now he's claiming he reinvented fire. Another stunning inroad into his Make Hell Great Again blah de blah.
I'll always think you're hot.
I guess we all have to play our part in curbing global warming.
No, I don't have the remote in my pocket!
An old tube TV? That settles it. We're in hell.
Coming up next...Dante’s Inferno...stay tuned
If you think it’s so bad here keep it up and I’ll send you to the White House!
We're about to head to the open bar, but first this short presentation about an exciting real estate opportunity!
At least the weather forcast is always accurate..!
When we were first dating you used to take me to live shows.
Look on the bright side - we won't be fighting over the remote.
Damn! Looks like the evangelicals were right.
The reception is hell on these old sets.
No, Honey I don't think that's the Yule log!
It 's not as hot as it looks
Good morning everyone, and welcome to orientation!
That's right, no cable, no remote control, and you have to use the dog ears for reception. Welcome to hell.
No cable, no color. This really is hell.
Reruns are hell.
If anyone changes the channel they put the Donald on for eternity.
These old tube sets have warmer tones, don't they?
What's a good girl like you doing here?
It still beats watching Fox News with my parents in Omaha.
I just figured we’d be watching “Keeping up with the Kardashian’s” forever.
Satan's decided to go green. Saving a bundle on fuel.
Horrible reception.
Does anyone know how to change the channel?
This is my first time doing performance art.
Fake news! They’re just warming us up.
I'm not surprised that eternal punishment begins with an employee onboarding video.
I knew it! No cable.
Here comes the timeshare pitch.
We only get the first season down here.
Have you seen the remote control?
I always wondered what they'd do with a masochist in Hell.
This is something of a reprieve. I left a woman scorned.
All this punishment because of a stupid fig leaf ?
I guess there's a special place in hell for couch potatoes!
Apparently, cable and flatscreen are only for the 1%
Where am I supposed to pin my orientation name tag?
Cheer up! The previews only last 1000 years.
I prefer the U.K. version.
TV for eternity, that's the punishment.
I always did hate reality TV.
I bet Scott Pruitt will be shocked when he finds out Hades has gone carbon neutral.
I hate these previews of upcoming events!
Perhaps they have brimstone on another channel.
No, we have 665 other channels, but all they show are “Real Housewives” marathons.
No, really! That's the whole difference, up there they have flat screen.
So Burning in Hell for Eternity is just another reality tv show?
Looks like its going to be another scorcher.
At first I was skeptical. But this timeshare presentation has me thinking.
AND no WiFi.
Do you think he could turn it up?
You were expecting a flat-screen TV in Hell?
I love the Yule Log channel.
It's either this or The Bachelor.
...masochists get only the televised version...
And you thought I was cheap.
Glasses are useless ‘cause they keep fogging up.
Thank God the State of the Union address is only once a year.
At least we don’t have to watch “The Apprentice” for eternity.
Welcome to the logical conclusion of reality television evolution.
It's a virtual Hell here!
Apparently Hell is carbon neutral now.
White House daily press briefing.
You know, I think the reception is better down here.
It’s either this or Hell’s newest hit show, Chicago Sanitation.
Apparently the fuel bill to run the old fire pit was costing him an arm and a cloven hoof !
And you will not be permitted to pause, rewind or fast forward.
Usually I avoid watching the trailers, I like to be surprised.
This is worse than Hell! We have to watch Fox!
Last year's "State of Etenal Damnation Address" took 600 hours.
I hear they're running out of room.
The Seventh Circle has cable, but there's nothing on.
Mind if I change channels?
It’s got the viewing audience of the super bowl, plus you can’t wait for the commercials
No cable and only ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN & FOX... this really IS Hell.
He's gone carbon neutral.
Unfortunately, it's not fake news.
During orientation you will learn it is not so much the heat as it is the humidity.
You will now be divided into four groups as follows. Rare, medium rare, medium and well done.
I swear to God touch me one more time and I'll call him over!
We only get one channel, it's Hillary's burning emails.
The reception is good but the content is hell.
Eh, the book was better
No more actual brimstone; blame legal.
Actually, you don't get the full experience without the smell of brimstone.
What in Hell are we watching?
This show is so hot right now.
I hate it when he makes us watch the news
The Rapture will be televised.
So this is where all the ratings are coming from.
Is this the prequel?
I heard that this part of the orientation lasts 1000 years.
The GOOD news is that you’ll have TV. The BAD news is that you’ll have TV.
No flat screen? Now I know we're in hell.
This isn't exactly the reception I expected....
This is white collar Hell.
Orientation.
They don't even have cable. It really *is* hell.
Glad I was able to squeeze into this orientation session. What'd I miss?
It’s hell without cable.
Coming attractions.
The carbon tax here must be hell.
Who needs to watch "Naked & Afraid" when you can be naked and afraid.
It's this or Fox News.
Must be a cooking channel.
His Dad set these parental controls after the Fall.
Lucky we're not in Hawaii.
This is why it's called Limbo!
Season 1 was better.
For what I did, I don't deserve to be in the overflow room.
No one's made it to the end so there's no spoilers!
The first circle of hell is just fire safety training videos.
We knew it would be bad, but, for the love of GOD we don't even get cable?
funny how I used to hate pledge week and now I miss it
The other place has HD, cable, and a remote that works.
Showing 'The Naked and The Dead' every night does not mean he's witty.
He keeps promising us a bathroom break at the next commercial.
Pretty good reception down here.
The torture is that there's no remote.
Typical, we only get the Fireplace Channel.
So is this today's weather or the forecast?
The reception isn't great, but we also get Fox News down here.
On Christmas they switch to the yule log!
The real sin here is analog TV.
But there weren't enough of us to help him win the popular vote
This is just until they complete the natural gas installation.
Eternal Damnation Yule Log ... Priceless.
Good thing you’re not in that shithole
Is it me, or has Satan been absolutely insufferable ever since he landed the deal with Netflix?
Could be a lot worse, like old Lawrence Welk shows.
They switch it to the Yule Log once a year, but in July, just to mess with us.
What the Hell?
TV helps me take my mind off of things.
In Heaven they have a 60 inch flat screen
I've seen this one before, it's another re-heat.
We should have researched the timeshare before we took the free vacation.
I hate re-runs...
I was prepared for the heat, but standard definition?
What are you doing after the movie?
Standby for words from Donald F. Trump.
To hell with Amazon Fire TV.
He'd probably get more heat if he put a little tin foil on the antenna.
I heard that in the 8th Circle, the only thing you get to watch are "The Apprentice" reruns.
The naked truth ... this is virtual hell!
I brought a doctor's note to Jury Duty, too, and they didn't make me stay for Orientation. Just saying...
When he's mad, he switches it to "Everybody Loves Raymond."
Thinking 'bout changing my church membership.
Isn't this a bit of overkill?
If it were heaven, that'd be a digital flat screen.
I hear heaven has cable.
How did you end up in economy class?
I hear he's working on a syndication deal with Fox.
It's more consuming than I expected.
The safety videos always bore me.
It used to be a PowerPoint.
Not one of us is really looking at the TV.
Think he'd turn on the ball game if I asked nicely?
It's not as bad as having to watch reruns of The Apprentice.
Next up: 30 continuous days of 'Keeping up with the Kardashians'
I'm actually a fan of reality TV.
I heard the orientation makes it seem worse than it is.
I was pretty confident we would be able to get Fox News down here.
This next bit's my favorite.
Eternity is a long replay
It only gets PBS
No cable! What the hell?
I always saw Lucifer as a Fox News kinda guy.
Wait, and you are sure we are not in the White House?
And right when this orientation was looking promising.
This may be a case where the movie is actually better than the book!
The ultimate punishment...Reality TV!
Even Hades accepts climate change as a reality.
It's this or Fox.
I've seen it before. It's not so hot.
I know our EPA boss says we have to watch FOX, but did they have to take our clothes too?
If I knew we couldn't get cable I would have behaved better.
You're a newbie? Well, we've just completed 400 years of 24/7 Gilligan's Island reruns. Next is The Apprentice.
Apparently there's also a special place in hell for nudists.
I'm not sure the network is ready for "Naked Apprentices".
At least it's real news.
I wish it was fake news.
Anybody seen the remote?
Tomorrow we watch C-Span.
One channel and there's nothing to see.
At the commercial break we get to watch infomercials for 170 years.
At least they don't get cable news down here.
Forget about the outdated television, I thought there'd be more be more Black people here.
The orientation IS hell.
Commercial free is not always a good thing.
You know, I thought watching C-SPAN was painful enough.
This place seems to be outdated. Wanna get the hell outta here?
"...devilishly funny.." Peter Travers, Rolling Stone
You really do know this is hell. No cable, just rabbit ears and the same damn channel.
The only channel we get down here is FOX News.
The first season was so much better.
The picture is great! It’s almost as if we are there.
I heard that this is just temporary...till the icecaps are melted
Oh, great, more reruns.
Well it is better than the View.
So what, they just alternate this and The Jersey Shore?
I thought this was a place for rich people.
Hannity isn't even trying anymore
I was a fixer for a major client. And you?
It's like the new museum but without the exit through the gift shop.
The worst part is there are no subtitles
Note to Sartre: Hell is TV without cable.
Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, now we have to watch 'Reality TV in Hell'.
It doesn't really pack the same punch on the small screen.
Oh this again, I've seen this a least thousand times.
In Purgatory we just get the trailer.
It’s worse than I thought. 24 hours a day of Fox News.
And there's no way to "skip ad".
I heard the new torture is having to watch & listen to a Sarah Huckabee Sanders press briefing...on a loop...
Must be Purgatory. Hell would be Trump.
I think I'm in the wrong orientation session.
Must be Christmas Eve.
Of course, no cable.
Well, looks like Sartre got it all wrong !
Did I miss Judge Judy?
You know, I directed this.
He’s just trying to scare us. It’s only a movie on a crappy old TV.
I just hope there are no ads.
Welcome to orientation.
From what I hear,viewer discretion is advised.
I’m surprised how good the reception is down here.
It's a commercial for your new home; it runs twenty-four seven.
So far so good--no long PowerPoints and no icebreaker games.
Looks like our Amazon Fire account runs through eternity.
Ugh. Reality TV again tonight.
No matter what he says, don't pull his tail.
At least on the other channels you get snow.
I can't say much for their customer service, but it's a helluva improvement over Comcast's.
This is only the 6th Level. The 7th makes you deal with cable.
It was either this or Fox & Friends.
Rabbit ears. Now there's your real hell.
I'm more confused than ever about this whole purgatory thing.
No, I think the punishment here is that it's an old model tube television.
Anything less than 3840 x 2160 pixels is hell for me.
It's called "The Insurance Channel."
I hear if you don't behave, they send you back.
We’ll damn! The rumors about hell being owned by the cable companies are true!
In Heaven, I hear it's fluffy clouds on HD Flat Screens.
I didn't realize pre-marital counseling was so intense.
Actually, this isn’t the hellish part. Just wait for Fox News to begin.
I hate reality TV.
Last week it was reruns of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" and "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo."
I hate when people force you to watch their favorite TV show.
Direct feed to Fox News...this is hell!
Well, it's better than Fox.
You'll receive a certificate when you complete your orientation.
They said there was a special place for television show critics...
I've been to worse orientations.
For an orientation video, the production values aren't bad.
Hey, I love the Yule Log!
Reruns, again? It's like they want us to suffer.
Damn, another rerun.
I bet you I can flip this place in a week with an upgraded home theater system and central air install.
The first season was so much better.
In an act of pure torture, the devil played fire and brimstone on TV instead of the royal wedding.
Who says this is worse than trying to unsubscribe from Comcast?
I am naked and afraid.
The genius of this place is not having a remote.
I’m beginning to think this fire and brimstone talk is fake news
I can't change it! Someone's stolen the remote.
I heard heaven has a 52" flat panel.
It's definitely hell because there's no remote.
I totally just saw where the loop started again.
This really is hell....no cable!
Don’t worry the pilot is always the worst episode
Hell is not having cable.
This is kinda nice. The wife and I used to watch a Yule Log on TV around the holidays.
You are hot. So am I.
I don't think we really need a preview.
I never imagined it would be this chilly here.
The cable is down, surprise
I never knew how much I'd miss cable.
They did say that the timeshare pitch would be for a hell of a trip to a hotspot destination.
It's less painful than I had imagined, but more depressing.
It's really not that different from home.
No, actually, this is Hellish.
The fire orientation is very retro, but I heard the brimstone orientation is a multimedia extravaganza!
Something tells me this isn’t fake news.
I hear that in the seventh circle they have Netflix
It really doesn't live up to the hype.
You would think he could afford a flatscreen.
When I first got here I was relieved, but after a while it's as boring as hell.
I hear you get an iPod in heaven.
Mind telling me what the hell is going on?
Do we have to watch is vacation videos again?
I hear the other place has Hulu.
I'm just glad it's not another 'Roseanne' rerun.
It's mandatory viewing once every thousand years. Seems the people in HR just don't get it.
Coming up next: brimstone!
24/7 newstainment...this must be hell.
He's saving tons with this fire video since the price of oil went up.
This movie is making me hot!
It's called "Hell on Earth". It's our favorite show since Trump took office.
Don't say a word otherwise it's back to Fox News!
What the hell... no flat screen!?
On Tuesday’s we watch Backdraft.
Don’t even think about changing the channel.
Welcome to Hell, it’s cable with only one channel!
Turns out, the worst thing really is waiting for the cable guy.
I heard they have flat screens in heaven. I shouldn't have used the carpool lane alone...
¨Who keeps telling him not to change it?¨
Every so often the antenna picks up brimstone.
Okay...the fight against global warming has gotten seriously out of hand!
Do you think they get cable in heaven?
Clothed captioning is only available on the upstairs TV.
Hey, it could be worse. In the innermost circle they have to stand on stilettos and watch The Kardashians for eternity.
For every show, from Walking Dead to Game of Thrones, they cut the last ten minutes. I tell you, it's hell.
It's just not the same experience when viewed online.
These virtual tours are okay but they just don't capture the soul of eternal damnation.
I heard they have all the cable channels in heaven.
Today's forecast: Hot with a 20% chance of brimstone
Spoiler Alert. It doesn’t end well.
Don’t you hate it when the previews gives away the ending?
We got a much better view than the folks who are going to be looking at the side of the TV for eternity.
They're going to force us to watch "Towering Inferno" in black & white.
Are they serving lunch after the promotional video, or do we have to listen to him pitch the place as well?
Yes, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Shut up and watch the orientation program already!
Their virtual reality isn't exactly cutting-edge, is it?
The cable companies are in a different circle of Hell.
reality tv.
It's exactly like they pictured it on TV.
Well, where would you hide the remote?
They’re trying to reduce global warming
Forced to stand and watch the Weather Channel forever... about what I expected.
I don’t know what’s worse — being naked or having Spectrum as our cable provider.
Reality TV has gone to hell.
The recession sure is hitting Hell hard.
It's not even HD. Can it get any worse?
I guess the cable deal I sold my soul for expired when I died.
In heaven they get flatscreens.
It's an orientation video. I'm told it's narrated by the President.
Huh - more fake news.
If that is all hell is, it was worth it.
Heaven must have cable.
I didn't know that watching the world go up in flames would get such high ratings.
To be honest, I never saw boobs on Earth.
It's like the holiday yule log video only with brimstone.
You have to watch the sales pitch to get the free vacation.
It’s a documentary about the environment.
I got here late, but it think it's the "Coming Attractions".
amazing reception for rabbit ears
Aw, hell, I think it’s a rerun!
All this plasma here and He can’t manage to scare up a flat screen tv?
Local news — always with such doom and gloom.
Don't worry folks. IT'S DRY HEAT!
The worst part is finding out that Hell hasn't gone digital yet.
No! No! It’s just a prelude to the White House press briefing.
Let's hope it's fake news.
Orientation. I can see why they don't go to a lot of expense. It's a pretty easy concept to grasp.
I can handle the heat, but having to watch Fox News is just the worst.
These days they just make us watch the fireplace channel
I wrote GEICO ads when I was alive. You?
I have had enough of this reality TV!
Nice of him to ease us into it.
Makes me hot, how about you?
And I thought Satan ran the cable TV industry.
In Heaven the streets are lined with 110 inch Ultra HD TV's and angels bring you buttered popcorn.
The smoke alarm kept going off.
Seriously?
I don’t remember reading about this in the Terms and Conditions.
Don't worry about the picture quality. ?Beelzebub announced that the cable installer would be here between 8 a.m. and eternity.
I hope he votes me off on tonight's episode.
It'll be much worse once they get HDTV...
On the plus side, it's commercial-free.
God I'd kill to watch The Crown right now.
Wow! Great reception for rabbit ears!
Oh, we're in Hell alright; not only is that not a flat screen, it's the only channel.
Sound is terrible, but it's a Hell of a picture!
Fox News would have been hell.
Beats watching the news.
I never liked the Yule log much either
These time-share presentations are hell!
Down here you can't expect more than local programming.
At least they let me keep my glasses for this.
Flat screens and cable would be heaven.
Well this a let down.
Nothing but white people and basic cable, clearly this is hell.
After the introductory video , we pair off and resume sinning.
I heard that people started complaining about the smoke so the board was forced to make changes.
Enough Weather Channel already.
Well, this is one benefit to the soaring price of oil.
The forecast for tonight is extra crispy!
So, THIS is hot sex. It's worse than I thought
Rumor has it they’re watching Roseanne in heaven.
This must be Hell. No cable!
The worst part is there is an ad every 5 minutes.
At least it's commercial-free.
"Naked and Afraid' is wickedly popular down here.
Last time we only had to throw our books in.
You wanna Netflix and burn in hell tonight?
I sold my soul to cable tv when I was 12. How about you?
These YouTube instructional videos really are helpful
The people of the United States gathering to watch Trump's State of the Union address
How is this different?
If we want the Super Bowl we have to put up with the local ads.
I'm not afraid and I'm available for infinity.
McLuhan was obviously wrong, but I didn't think I'd learn it this way.
Actually, I would rather be cast into a real lake of fire.
It's a lot cheaper than keeping those fires going constantly.
A blatant violation of net neutrality.
One person sues Hell one time, and now we all have to attend the annual safety presentation.
It looks a lot less scary on a black and white TV.
I think this new format of "Fox and Friends" really sizzles.
That's right. 66 episodes of Game of Thrones... we will never play the 67th.
When Millenials said we Baby Boomers would go to Hell for what we did to the environment, they weren't kidding.
We finally got it-nothing is real to us unless we see it on TV.
Who'd a thought we'd be the one's to benefit from global warming?!
Of course it's Hell. They don't have cable.
“Heat rises, so they get global warming up top and mark my words, we’ll start to freeze down here”.
Anywhere else and all we'd get would be snow.
No cable and a small vintage '50s TV. Yeah, it's hell.
It's Hell alright. Not even flat screen TV.
This is the snowball episode. One of my favorites.
...ZERO plot development.
See? Even hell signed the Paris Agreement. That was our Downfall.
It could be worse - they could play Fox News.
You know those old tube sets gave off a lot of heat.
It's official. Trump is the only person anywhere not trying to reduce carbon emissions.
That's why it's called Hell. There's only one channel and only one show.
This IS Hell! --3 channels with nothing on.
When the commercials come on, they try to sell you Kool-Aid
Just what I expected. All commercials.
It's like his soul's not in this anymore.
It’s something called Honey Boo Boo.
None of us read the fine print on that Amazon Fire stick.
All their pants were on fire, and the news covered it.
With all that fracking up top, they ran out of things to burn.
I find the fake flames kind of tacky, but he says the gas bill was getting out of hand.
Climate change, my ass!
Is Gordon Ramsay going to come out?
I hear they have cable in heaven.
It's horrid. And they won't let us see the first season.
OMG, it's worst than I feared, It's black and white only.
I would have lived my life differently if I'd known there was no basic cable.
Oh cool, I love this show!
We can pick this or Roseanne.
Wow. They're using an Amazon fire stick.
Analog? What kind of hellhole is this?!
And I found out about my eternal damnation via text message.
Hell is not having cable and all you get is reruns of the apocalypse.
It came down to paying the gas or the cable bill.
This is where we came in
Orientation videos - seen one, seen them all...
Bah...another reality show...
These safety training videos always crack me up
I heard God let’s his souls watch Judge Judy
I heard NBC picked up another eternity of this after it got cancelled.
This must be Heaven... heh heh... boobs.
I'll play the devils advocate and say its the weather channel.
Things certainly have changed down here ever since the Cubs won the World Series.
Don’t tell him it’s a rerun.
Well, at least it's better than watching Fox News
These timeshare promotions keep getting more intense.
It's to reduce their carbon emissions.
This program may contain some nudity.
Hell gets 300 channels and it’s flames on every one of them!
So, hell is having no cable.
These timeshare presentations really are hellish
It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and yet, it's also kinda worse.
I still don't understand what this has to do with white privilege.
I heard they're cutting down on heating costs
Down here, they can only pick up three channels: Fox, Home Shopping Network, and the Yule Log.
I love The Real Housewives of Hades
I find his rallies very motivating - if he can get elected president, then any of us can.
It was on TLC, but we complained.
It reminds me of our honeymoon cruise and the only DVD they had was Titanic.
Well, at least there aren't any commercials on Hellovision...
I guess this means that hell has finally frozen over, huh?
The accommodations are OK, but the reception is lousy.
Apparently they've got flat screens in the other place
No Netflix. Figures.
Grey's Anatomy has gotten ridiculous.
I really need a hearing aid- I thought she told me to go to Haiti...
Hi, I'm Stu. I'm a sagittarius, love cats, and cultural immersion vacations.
I’m glad we all get together to watch Flame Of Thrones.
Apparently Hell doesn't have cable, either.
I know the guy that directed this.
My parents warned me there was only one channel down here.
I heard they get basic cable in Limbo.
The weather report is for continued hot.
Dang! I already saw this one!
My lawyer says I'll be out in 3 months.
Reality tv for eternity - my personal hell.
Try thinking of it as a Yule log, 24/365.
'You'll burn in hell,' " was a little overstated, wasn't it?
I've already seen this one
Beelzebub said it’s to minimize our carbon footprint.
This is NOT what it looked like in the brochure...
Hell is a TV with only one channel.
This OSHA safety video is supposed to be 15 minutes long, but it feels like an eternity!
I’ve been to better orientation sessions
We call it "Netflix and Burn."
These public service announcements are always about fire safety.
If I new it was going to be like this I would have been a lot badder.
Ever since the election it’s been too cold to go outside.
Of course I think you're hot......
Just as I suspected, no remote.
I'll be damned. It's the Yule Log.
It's worse than I imagined... No cable!
Once again, it's going to be a scorcher.
Orientation Day video. Ugh! This is gonna be hell.
You know you're in Hell when you only get one channel on the box.
Oh no. It’s that damned Yule log again.
It’s just a fireplace video he’s using while he switches to geothermal.
Who the H..E.. double hockey sticks died and made this guy lord of the under world?
Rabbit ears! When was the last time you saw rabbit ears!
One channel for eternity? I should have been a better person.
I don't know about you, but the laugh track really takes me out of the moment.
Budget Cuts
They get 60" flat screens up in Purgatory.
And now,a word from our sponsor.
I guess we really are in Hell... they don't even have basic cable.
Your AccuWeather forecast says it's going to be hotter than hell today.
Yeah, but it's a hell of a channel!
This is good. I was afraid Bill O’Reilly would be doing orientation.
There are no flatscreens in hell.
Hell is not having a remote.
I mean, how cheap can you get?
It is truly hell without cable.
What will burn our eyes is this old screen resolution.
No 4K 80 inch flat screen? This really is Hell.
You'd think it would at least be in colour.
No, it's just like heaven here, but without cable.
This movie goes on forever.
You can literally feel the heat, can't you?
It beats watching FOX.
I hope this first date isn't moving too fast for you.
Analog TV? We really ARE in hell!
It's virtually hell
I guess you know you're in hell when you realize you've avoided every opportunity to look good naked, and this is the result. That, and there's only one channel...
Don't let the hot flames get to you, after midnight we get snow.
It's not even in HD! Now I know what hell is!
It's pledge week.
We thought it was going to be in color.
Looks like a lot of people went through hell to get into this program.
Real Housewives of Hell is on next
Relax, it’s a nudist colony. What the hell can go wrong?
Yes, but after we learned they only get C-SPAN in the other place, no one really complains here anymore.
Welcome to Heck.
I bet heaven is just as over-hyped.
At least, there are no commercials. That would be torture.
I so hate it when the trailer reveals all the best scenes.
As a loyal viewer of Fox & Friends, how bad can it be?
The real hell is watching the ads before the video starts.
I would have been a better person if I'd known hell was an eternity without streaming and only one local channel to watch.
I can't believe we lost the remote
No one here has ever paid for Netflix.
You'd better wake up Donald. Fox & Friends is about to start.
Eternal flames I could take, but eternal re-runs?
He’s calling this reality TV
Same old hellfire, brimstone and eternal damnation. Nothing but reruns again.
Damn, it's the Yule Log.
Next, they will tell us it is freezing over!
I produced “Project Runway”. You?
This is the first circle. Second circle, Home Shopping Network.
Oh no! It's another Trump rally!
OH HECK!
And, on cable we get The Omen , and , one day per year , we get to watch the Yule Log.
Well, at least we have the Yule Log channel.
It kinda reminds me of the Yule Log we used to watch on Christmas Eve.
It would look a lot worse in HD.
They can't get cable.
He's trying to cut down on CO2 emissions
These timeshare videos are so boring.
It's going to be hell down here without cable.
Now, we just have to watch this quick fire-safety video before we can start all of the fun.
Don't complain or he'll put on C-Span.
He always shows his vacation videos at this time of year.
Of course, the worst part are the commercials.
You think this is punishing? Wait until the car insurance commercials start.
This is the special hell for baby boomers.
There's a lower level for advanced sinners. Down there they show non-stop commercials.
It's not the heat, it's the humidity
An "Introduction to Hell" video? What a thoughtful gesture toward us atheists!
If I knew we wouldn't have HD, I would've paid more attention to those commandments...
It's probably a lot more effective in the theater in IMAX with multi-channel sound and big subwoofers.
It's fake torment.
We lucked out, channel 56 is showing penguins walking on their own excrement.
At least we have VHF.
200 channels and nothing on.
It's a cost-cutting measure. The price of burning sulfur has gone thru the.. whatever they have here for a roof.
This is a short preview of your ultimate destination.
“I hear they’re having trouble making a sequel because this one’s eternal.
Break's over. Back to Fox News.
You'd think he could afford an HDTV.
This isn't even the worst part. They don't have free wifi.
Breaking news, my ass.
Hell of a show.
Welcome to virtual hell.
I've heard it gets better in season two.
They said it would be just like we were there...
What? One channel...one program...!?! This IS pure hell!
Fake news - they didn't get the climate change update - hell WILL be freezing over.
Is this virtual reality?
This isn't the Disco Inferno I was expecting.
I can’t remember. Is it a virtual or literal hell in here?
Has anyone tried adjusting the brightness control?
I hope it warms up after orientation!
Looks like we have the correct attire!
Who knew the budget cuts would reach these depths?
Here we go with another episode of Satan’s Got Talent.
I guess Satan is trying to reduce his carbon hoofprint.
You don't realize how much you miss high-definition until you don't have it.
This is the part where fire burns for eternity. Spoiler alert.
I told you they don't have cable.
I'm not sure this orientation video is necessary.
Like drinking hot tea in summer - it'll make you feel cooler.
Baby Boomers don't need to experience the real thing -- they find that televised flames are just as effective.
This must be that cold day in hell that my wife kept talking about.
He calls it reality TV.
It's like that classic Yule log fireplace program - only with more torture.
I understand they have HDTVs in heaven.
We are doomed to watch the Christmas log for eternity!
Who died and made him God?
It minimizes our carbon footprint.
I don't know why, but watching the evening news always depresses me.
Rabbit ears? Seriously?
Thank heavens, there are no commercials!
That’s one hell of a show.
Sure the last resort had cable, but this place seems more upfront about the costs.
World's on fire, let's watch TV
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Fox News, and Trump's tweets...this is hell!
I always seem to be in the overflow crowd.
They start with the fire. Then the fury. But its all rather derivative.
Fox’s fake flames.
It's a rerun.
Why do they bother? Does anyone actually watch TV in the waiting room?
It was either this or The Disney Channel.
Broadcast? Non-HD? This IS Hell.
Scary stuff, but Shark Week is coming in 2 days.
It's Sean Hannity's new graphic.
We've been acquired by Sinclair.
This orientation video is kinda depressing.
There's no choice. All programs are titled Burn in Hell.
It's okay, but the book was better.
It’s an economy package, just Fox and the other local channels.
Furnace went down so we’re forced to binge watch.
I wish I had known about the seven-hour orientation before I pulled the trigger.
And I thought cable was hell.
This is what's waiting for Fox News.
He’s obviously never been to Burning Man.
In Heaven they have flat screens and videos of clouds.
Actually, I'm not sure which is worse
Trust me, this beats the Kardashians.
When Amazon asked me to test its Fire TV, this isn't what I had in mind.
I wish he would get to the brimstone channel already.
And yet no one cares the TSA has gone this far.
You’d expect Lucifer to have cable.
I never thought I would say this, but let's get dressed and find cable.
The TV reception is better than we had at the White House.
I was bad in a conventional sort of way, but if I had known that the whole fire and brimstone thing would be televised and not real, I think I would have pushed my badness factor way beyond conventional.
Slow tv, a homogenous crowd, liberal nudity? I swear, it used to be heavenly to be Danish.
You think in hell we'd at least get a flat screen
I’m just here for the free buffet.
I'm sorta enjoying this.
They were right about hell but embarrassingly wrong about the fire.
What the hell are we watching tonight?
Who knew budget cuts would have a plus side.

He’s hitting all the targets now for reduced emissions.
Lacks verisimilitude.
I was told we'd be watching "The Naked and the Dead."
Great! I love coming attractions.

This is Hell. No Wi-Fi.
Poor bastard put his fire and brimstone money into Bitcoin.
It's hell not having a remote!
Don't worry its just a bad dream. There's no way in Hell they could get that good a picture with just rabbit ears.
I expected the content to be a little more racy.
I kind of like this virtual reality stuff.
I"m waiting to see what Fox News has to say about the temperature today.
Can you believe those rabbit ears get a signal down here?
My dry cleaner and cable provider are already here.
Only one channel? This really is torture!
. . . and not enough eternal tormentors either. I don't think they were counting on the number of congressmen.
Hell of a timeshare pitch, eh?
I always enjoy it when Lucifer explores his more conceptual side.
I've already seen this one on my hand-held. It goes on for an eternity!
This was absolutely state of the art a few decades before any of us were born.
We watch this for six months then they show Brimstone
Apparently all performance artists end up in this place.
I hear the cable guy is going to hook us up between 'abandon hope' and 'never.'
What made you decide to audition for 'Naked and Afraid' ?
And the worst is, they only show Fox News !
Today’s temperature is heating up to a high of “Hot As Hell”
It may not be "fair and balanced" but at least it isn't fake news.

Actually, I'm not in that much of a rush to get into the main chamber.
Not another episode of As the World Burns- can’t we at least have cable.
I think we picked the wrong door.
Don't you feel that this infomercial last an eternity?
¨This reminds me of a bender of sorts I had in college¨
Frankly, I think the parties have declined with Hef gone

Seriously, do we all really think the weather for tomorrow will be any different?
This is so much better than the real thing.

He loves sharing his holiday videos.
It's endless and lacks passion, but as adaptations go, I've seen worse.
I’m really getting tired of porn. Let’s toast some marshmellows.
Looks like limbo isn't so bad at all.
we are, after all, genetically programmed to gather round the fire.
We can't complain too much. At least they have an Amazon fire stick.
When you live with millions of accountants, sooner or later you're going to make cuts.
I still only hear 'Laurel.'
See everyone wants to be a director,...don’t say anything but he’s no Hitchcock.
A cost savings move by Corporate.
That may be so, but wait until they realize it’s on an infinite loop.
I remember when there was fire everywhere and a Hershey's Bar only cost a nickel!
It should be cooler when we get there, they say that television adds 20 degrees.
Sure as hell he's not forking over for cable.
It's the same on every channel.
When I said my idea of hell is not having a flat panel HDTV, I did not realize this would be taken so literally...
Is that it?
Who knew that eternity too was virtual?
Agreed, its not much on ambiance but so much better for air quality.

The programming has really gone to hell.
Eternal reruns of the Trump presidency, it's the new hell.
It's his answer to the Yule log!
It’s okay in December, otherwise the Yule Log gets old fast.
If I knew it was going to be like this, my life on earth would have been a lot rowdier.
For the holidays he throws in a Yule log.
Funny thing is, it totally dominates its time slot.
Everlasting fire just became too resource-intensive.
The power of suggestion is not working. I still feel chilled.
I'd really like to twist those knobs one last time.
Hard to believe rabbit ears work here.
I told you, it's non-stop fake news.
Is it just me or is it warm in here?
Orientation is hell.
These are vanity glasses. I can see just fine.

I think you're really hot, but then again, I guess we'll all be soon.
The heaven channel has a lot less screaming.
It's time for 'What Not To Wear'
I was really hoping for, ‘The Devil in Miss Jones.’
It just got picked up for another billion seasons.
A virtual hellfire to cut down on carbon emissions - maybe this is environmentalist heaven.
Sure, the reality TV is always hell to watch, but not ever having to deal with the cable company makes it seem like heaven.
Quit complaining. At least it's not the Fox New Channel.
I guess the building doesn't allow open flames anymore.
Rumor has it in the 9th circle they get Fox News.
I have no idea why he's using a 1950s video of a Yule Log instead of his usual real fire. You'll have to ask him about that. After all, the details are in the Devil.
Everything went to hell after they repealed net neutrality.
Oh, that... yeah, well they’re trying something new - televised flames are more energy efficient.

EP of Wife Swap. You?
This year's Burning Man is lame.
I'm not worried, if this were really hell, CNN would be on the TV.
When they asked, "Cloths or T.V.?", it was a no-brainer.
This is hell, no cable!
Is that a live feed from the 7th ring of hell?
They said that after we watch the intro video, we get a tour of the timeshare properties.
It's only that damn hemerrhoid infomercial!
In heaven, it’s the oscillating fan.
Wanna fuck?
And I couldn't even get a signal in my basement.
I liked it better in theaters.
This is what we get for spreading fake nudes.
I hate sweeps week!
I guess I was wrong Sharon. It looks like climate change really does effect everyone after all.
This nudist retreat might have been a bad idea...
I heard he got the idea from that 'Burning Yule Log' video.
The fireplace channel is all that's available. It's Hell!
We’ve been getting flack for our excesdive carbon footprint.
I'm guessing there's only one channel.
I guess he's finally concerned about global warming
The Weather report looks like another hot day.
Since Pope Fancis came along, the fires of Hell just haven’t been the same.
Theoretically I understand why people think its demeaning, but a person only gets so many opportunities to work for the White House. Am I right?
State media.
I appreciate the orientation. I hate surprises.
I think it is clear. You vote for some Democrat clown you burn in hell!!
Netflix and brimstone?
Nooooo! Not reality TV!
Kilauea. It's their favorite program down here.
Is someone going to tell him we won’t burn in hell this way?
I'll watch the safety video, but I am not signing the release waiver.
No flat screen or cable bothers me more than being naked.
I've always been more sensitive to cold compared to everyone else, that's all
This isn’t so bad.
Lookit all the tits! I’m in heaven!
Nah. No fires. Fake News.
Are you here for sexual assault too?
Look on the bright side. At least it’s not the Sean Hannity Show.
I was a media mogul, so yes,... I take this personally.
It's still better than reading a book.
I’m surprised the devil doesn’t have cable
During the holidays he plays a brightly burning but festive Yule log.
The suspense is killing me. Again.
On the bright side, it is better to watch a virtual reality fire, than be in one for all of eternity.
It's turning into a really cold day in hell.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
The heating bills were out of control.

He likes to torture us with reality tv.

Somehow, I thought it would be a little more realistic.
Could have been worse. We could have been forced to watch repeat episodes of Touched by an Angel.
Is it upside down? Or not? Take your time.
I hear they have a flatscreen up in circle three.
'"You're fired!' really means something down here."
It’s hard to tell the fire from the brimstone in standard definition.
Its his way of upgrading you to Satan Prime.
That’s where our clothes went!
The last thing I was expecting was a health and safety video!
Could be worse — over in the 9th ring they make them watch C-SPAN.
Well, I'd say it's kind of got a retro, 'Make Hell Malevolent Again', vibe going for it!
The scriptwriters have totally run out of ideas.
It's supposed to be a brief presentation, then we can go tour the hot tub
I told you it was “Fox”.
The punishment gets worse. It's soap operas in the afternoon.
Don't you just hate being having to be exposed to these orientation videos?
At least we're dressed properly.
These fake fires just don't have the feel of the real thing.
Our new zero-emissions heating system
This is only season 1, episode 1,283,426,735
Hey, I thought you said we weren't going to have to stand though the timeshare pitch?
Maybe the overflow room wasn't such a bad idea.
I always expected fire and brimstone to be a bit more scary and at least in HD
The worst timeshare pitch ever.
I guess this is what we get for not reading our cable companies user agreement
At noon they turn on the Big Bang Theory.
Sure, we got 500 channels, but they're all the same!
Reception was better in the second ring.
Nothing is more sinful than watching "Hell's got Talent"
It doesn't look so scary when its not high definition.
I heard they serve burnt popcorn.
The true Hell is that aspect ratio.
„Not being able to change channels has proven to be much more hellish than actual hellfire.“
Hell or daytime TV - tough choice!
In heaven, they watch the Yule log.
'If you wanted to see the final episode, you should have gone to heaven!'
The next season comes out in one hundred million years.
Oh, Hell. Reruns again!
Do you think this could possibly be fake news?
Strangely overlooked in the classical literature, sexual harassment training takes place at the entrance to the Second Circle of Hell.
If we're going to be here for all eternity, can we at least get a flat screen?
Infernal contraption!
Hell is reality TV.
I remember watching the pilot
This must be alternative hell.
Apparently, this cuts our CO2 emissions in half.
So I guess WAS wrong to peddle all those subprime mortgages
We all wanted Reality-TV. Now I guess we get what we asked for.
You’re new here. Spoiler alert . . .
Actually, I find it less painful than commercial television.
This is the strangest vacation pitch I have ever seen.
I used to be in corporate videos. Think that's how I got here.
A flatscreen would be heaven.
In heaven, they have Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.
Climate change is real.
Yep. 7 days a week. 24 hour Trump station.
No cable? You think he does that on purpose?
first they make us watch 666 seasons of hell's kitchen on a Russian analog tv...
This is hell, there is no remote.
But as you'll see, it wasn't until my 666th appearance on Fox and Friends that I did my best work.
No cable in hell.
Nobody calls it a "boob tube" anymore.
brimstone comes on at 10
So this is where the old TVs went.
They've been promising HD forever. Don't believe 'em.
The other channel is Fox News.
Is it too late to change my vote? America doesn't look that great after all.
Big deal. I saw the original on Broadway.
'Just more re-runs of the Bill Cosby Show."
Welcome to the premiere of "The Inconvenient Truth 5: The Devil Wears Nada"
I think I’ve seen this show before.
Of course it's hell—every time I try to adjust the picture, he pokes me!
As orientation videos go, it's pretty ho-hum.
Hell, there’s no cable
So everything really is black and white.
You have to really check the reviews before you book one on these Groupon all inclusive getaway deals. Did you even look at the reviews Sharon?
This standing around really burns my ass.
At least the television here is better.
It's not quite what I expected.
The technology is old but the message is the same
So what network did you work for up there?
I guess I should have read their early termination clause more closely.
Welcome to Millennial Hell
This must be the "teaser."
Jeez, I can't wait for the season finale."
Did you remember to bring the sun block?
It's like "The Sopranos" - nobody knows how it really ends!
And this circle of hell is exclusively for people who lied on their Tinder profile.
Safety orientation
It's not even in HD.
I hear it's a public service announcement about how the climate is changing down here too.
Who knew the cable company would be this pissed when we cut the cord?
New TSA procedures? At least we get to keep our shoes on.
Being stuck here with antenna TV sure is hell.
He's economizing!
You are doomed to an eternity of watching FOX NEWS!
You are so hot.
Always the Weather Channel with this guy.
So this is it?
There's only one bloody hell channel down here.
Let's poke his eyes out with the antenna. We have nothing to lose.
Hell, no cable
When they told me Hell was being forced to watch Bonanza reruns forever I didn't believe it."
gone are the days when they had actual demons doing the induction to hell.
I feel a bit more comfort that it is not high definition.
Can someone change that to Fox and Friends?
It's the Irony Channel.
Watch and burn.
At least our fire and brimstone won't be in high definition.
Oh great, here comes the time share pitch.
Somehow, when they promised us we could be on 'Roasting With The Stars' I was expecting something different.
Figures -- I saw this one already
CNN? FOX? Isn't it just about choosing frying pan or fire?
I never thought they would be worried about a fuel shortage down here.
Broadcast TV? With a rabbit ears antenna. This IS Hell!
The outdated technology is just torture.
After having to watch FOX every day at our Federal offices, this channel is soothing.
Those are fake flames.
Due to budget cuts, you will need to use your imagination
Not add a log....ANALOG
It's going to be a loooong eternity
At least nothing will shrink where we're going.
This is a rerun.
You were a reality TV producer, too? Isn't that ironic?
I'm not sure they needed a 20 minute orientation video.
They get FOX News and CNN.
You'd think that with Satan's sinful materialism, he'd at least have a Flat Screen.
I know how it ends.
Were doomed he has the remote!
Hell is losing its edge - could have been commercials.
You know who I really feel bad for? The people looking at the back of the TV.
I'm all for safety training in case of a fire but this is ridiculous....
Don't blame me for climate change, I drove a Prius.
Welcome to the orientation program!
I can't stand it! Not only is it low def, but it's black & white!
Just one boring channel -- for Eternity.
The news is always so negative.
I thought hell was supposed to be other people.
This is virtual Hell!
Not having a flatscreen is hell.
No cable. That’s the hell of it.
No remote?.... It's hell alright.
No cable, no flat screen, no hi def, and all they get is Fox!
Reminds me of The Yule Log I used to watch
My kids were right. Living without modern technology IS Hell.
He is sending us to Hawaii.
Honestly, I am surprised they even have an orientation!
This is the casting call for 'Naked and Afraid: Dante's Inferno'.
Oh, I know! You got a haircut!
No, I get the post-modern-techno-criticism of it. I'm just saying mine shrinks when it's cold, and that's why I wish it was a real fire.
Is this the audition for,Naked and Afraid?
Reminds me of my thermodynamics class in college, only way hotter.
I should have known that, if I supported Donald Trump's quest for power, it would come to this!
This show has a real cult following.
It’s the same everyday; hot as hell again.
I'll bet it's fake news.
No flat screen? This is hell.
He comes to the colony every year, trying to sell us time shares.
Is this a preview of what’s to come
Who did you vote for?
Does he only get the Lava Channel?
I don't know. It does look like Hell, but the trident looks fake.
I never miss the previews.
Besides the humiliation of being naked, we can't change the channel.
Must be hell, it's all Three's Company reruns
At least someone's trying to stop global warming.
I told you Heck was better than Hell.
This used to be a Christmas tradition.
At least we don’t have to watch Fox News!
It's great here. Even get Fox News.
This is where they send you when you complain about your cable bill
These orientations seem to last for an eternity.
When we talked about allying with People of Color, bright red with horns and a tail wasn’t the color I had in mind.
I guess you could say the naked truth is Reality TV is literally going to hell.
Is he using the fireplace app?
They say it's been picked up for another 13 weeks.
Guess where I put the remote
It beats The Apprentice.
Apparently, he’s had a dispute over cable fees after they found out nudity was involved. For now, it’a Rabbit ears...
No HD, not even cable; this truely is Hell!
Well, at least we're dressed for it . . .
I’m not feeling the warmth.
Just be grateful it's virtual reality!
From what I've heard this You Tube version sure beats the real thing!
Welcome to the ultimate red state where no one has any coverage.
I really doubt his legal department requires the short intro video. I think he just like to show it.
Dare we suggest to him aluminum foil for the rabbit ears?
You know, the reception is much better than I was expecting.
We'll have to take off our fig leaves.
But the fake news never mentions we have air conditioning.
Hell yes! I'm naked and afraid!
They need to show the safety video first.
Don't look now, but there's a naked guy at eleven o' clock.
A five minute break for flames, then back to news.
I can’t wait to see the part that explains about brimstone!
Rabbit ears. This must be the seventeenth circle of hell.
The experts all said we'd freeze over.
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's his favorite show.
I can't believe they only get one channel and it's the yule log.
I didn't know Netflix binging qualified as sloth.
I don't actually want the timeshare - just the free vacation.
No flat screen, I guess this really is hell.
I hate this show.
I have been told we can upgrade to cable but there will be hell to pay.
Let's hope the next election doesn't have the same results.
Hell is other people...and standard definition.
Fake fire burns me up.
The trailers always oversell it.
My guess is, that it is Trump's innards.
I knew my old tv would end up down here. Goddamn thing sucked.
Comcast-Xfinity has one hell of a signal!
This is for all of you who once said 'What Reality Show in Hell did I win?' This one!
Fake news.
another rerun.
It’s just the one channel, but it is commercial free.
No HD? No cable? What kind of hell is this?
White House briefings make my stay here more enjoyable.
No remote....
It's the only channel. That's why they call this hell.
I hear that the Other Place has Oculus Rift.
Orientation videos never do the real thing justice.
Why is there never anything on down here except “Lucifer?”
Wonder if the Cosby Show is on.
Artificial, yes--but it provides a certain warmth.
Of course, it's Fox News.
More political ads! I never imagined that it would be THIS bad.
Only 1 channel? This really is hell.
If your brought marshmallows, you're out of luck.
This is the worst! I can't even see the screen!
It's much more interesting than the Brimstone channel.
Hell-o
I told you, Hell isn’t so bad. If only there were couches, this would be heaven.
They edited it for TV.
If you think that's scary, wait until you see it in color.
Ironically, they call it the fire station.
I've seen this flame before. Spoiler alert, it has a cool ending.
It's his reality show. We're forced to watch it... Word is he wants to run for higher office.
Later, he switches to the Brimstone channel
It’s our only reality show.
You'd think he could afford a flat screen!
Really! Rabbit ears?
If you think this is hell, until last year there was only AM radio.
I assumed hell would be bad, but low definition TV?
SOOooo much greener this way.
I know we're here for eternity, but did he have to buy the box set?
I don't know why we need to see the trailer. . .
He's tired of paying fines for safety code violations.
Damn it, Alice, I think it's another re-run.
Doesn't it just kill you, having to watch this in black and white?
The good news is, we get cable next month.
Seriously?? If he really wanted to stick it to us, he could put on an endless loop of Jersey Shore reruns.
Oh no, we’re already in hell. This orientation video takes an eternity. We’re going to be standing here for centuries.
Feels like we've been watching the same channel for eternity.
Actually, we all see something different. For me, it's a reel of baseball games on rain delay, followed by Stranger Things spoilers.
I'll take this over brimstone any day of the week.
The Brimstone Show comes on right after Fox News.
Nothing's on.
These workplace training videos are always so grim.
We're right here, and the best view is on the television
He’s particularly proud of the special effects.
Not even a flat screen? This place really is Hell.
It's called reality TV.
This seems like very politically correct eternal torment to me.
Hot enough for ya?
It's not so bad. The murderers have to watch "Blossom".
Sure beats the hell out of the Yule log they made us watch last Christmas.
Turns out you can't burn a finite amount of sulfur for all of eternity.
I've heard that in another 10,000 years we may get to watch it in color.
Hell hopes to be carbon neutral by Armageddon.
It has a nostalgic, sort of PBS kind of feel, and this crowd seems to like it.
I wish they'd turn the heat up in here.
Geesh, this is the orientation video from hell.
I wonder what they’re watching in heaven?
Great-another documentary
I just knew it, a vast wasteland.
They're conserving energy. But you get the message.
Do you think he could turn it up?
I heard the heaven people get cable and still have their genitals.
We only get the weather channel.
Welcome to Heaven, or as god likes to call it, “Hell”.
It's a big night, after this is the season premiere of Brimstone.
Is this the show about the dangers of infernal warming?
If those are not real flames, then are we fake nudes?
I love reality television.
No, there's no WiFi. There's not even goddam basic cable!
And if anyone complains about what’s in hell-o-vision, we’ll put it on the Hallmark Channel.
No digital high definition flames? This really IS Hell.
Of course it's not High Def. This is hell, you know.
Reality TV was hell on Earth, too.
Dare you to tell El Diablo over there where to stick those rabbit ears.
I think it got the idea from watching the Yule log.
It's always Christmas down here. That's the hell of it.
Naked ambition isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I've been to a lot of timeshare sales pitches but this one's amazing.
Can you believe it? Only one channel and it’s their version of the Yule log.
It’s the same infomercial on every channel.
No commericals, though. Amiright?
The real torture is that every channel is the same.
This level of technology will be a real turn off for millennials.
It's the usual. There's a 90 minute presentation before you collect the prize.
Yeah, I was a reality TV producer, too.
If even these guys can do their part on global warming....
I heard we'll get real flames if enough of us donate to the Patreon
it's only real when you see it on television.
No carbon OR microfibre pollution, good for him!
It would seem an introductory training video on eternal suffering and damnation is a bit of overkill.
The training departments video budget really has gone to Hell
I guess even the afterlife has become virtual reality.
Another ruse- it’s colder than hell down here.
You'll be feeling those flames when he switches to Virtual Reality headsets.
I guess this is the opposite of Netflix and chill?
This is America.
It's the second season "The Apprentice."
By converting to this televised simulation, they save One Million annually on heating costs.
I know we're all trying to be supportive, but someone needs to tell him his films lack artistic vision.
Hey - look! It's the same screensaver we had in the eighties!
It could be worse. At least there are no commercials.
This virtual hearth isn’t working much better than the virtual clothing.
I don't know which is worse--fire and brimstone for eternity, or watching Dr Phil for eternity.
All right, everyone. Mr. Lucifer couldn't make it in today; here is a video of the hellfire he would be roasting you in.
Must cost too much to heat the place.
I guess we should've read the fine print when we signed the contract for this pay-per-view channel.
That fire feels good on my you know what.
Have you ever been an extra in a von Trier film before?
What further proof do you need of global warming?
It's the newest teaser for coming attractions.
This is hell.
I’ll admit the programing is a little redundant
He says it’s the only station he can catch down here, but I don’t believe in him.
If this is hell, I'm all in.
At least it's cable, so we don't have to suffer through as many commercials.
Looks like Hell is watching "Naked and Afraid" while we ARE naked and afraid.
Suddenly, it seems like everyone we know is singe-watching!
You know, Sartre was right: 'Hell is not having basic cable.
Wi-fi? we don't even get cable down here?
Whoever owns the syndication rights to this show must be making a killing.
Hellfire isn't living up to my expectations.
I suppose he’ll show us the brimstone on a slide projector.
Other than C-SPAN? Yeah, sometimes he lets us watch reruns of The Apprentice.
Let's see what's going on in the other levels of Hell.
I thought hell would be more up to date...
I told you Hell hadn't frozen over!
This isn't the time share promo, is it?
"Is rerun hell better than regular hell?'
Really? This is breaking news?
At least we finally got the signal working.
Are you as turned on by fire porn as I am?
I hear that season two has even more fire and brimstone than season one.
I hate this show.
I used to think cable news 24/7 was torture
We don't really need the infomercial do we?
I knew it! The Devil does wear Prada.
I wonder what the Kardashians are up to.
No Cable? This really is Hell.
It's a virtual Hell!
Don't you just love watching the Yule log on Christmas morning?
I think I've seen this episode already.
This orientation is taking forever!
If I had known they only had standard definition in hell, I wouldn't have killed my wife.
they all die in the end
Hell hasn't been updated in a long time.
Propaganda.
Pray it doesn't go on forever!
The orientation really does help make the transition easier.
I really thought he’d have cable since the providers are all his acolytes
At least it’s not Fox...!
It was this or an eternity of Joanie loves Chachi
These timeshare presentations are always so uncomfortable.
It's not the same without the heat.
Helluva sequel."
Hey, you wanna get a drink later? Ha, just kidding.
Just a remake of Dante, and not a very good one at that.
No cable! This truly is Hell.
We are damned for eternity Molly ... a black and white cathode ray tube!!!
You know, I think I'm starting to like reality TV.
At least the reception is good.
I'm just happy it's commercial free.
Ok folks back on your hands and knees - coffee break's over....
So it is Hell not having a Big Screen!
So This is Hell, No Cable, old 25’ and someone else has the remote.
I am still cold.
Netflix and chill...in hell!
Hell is so retro.
This is TV hell: no cable but lots of nudity
So 'THIS' is global warming
Reality TV is really hell down here
Thank you for attending our "Orientation To Hell" Class.
You think this is bad, next comes 24 hours straight of cable pundits with no breaks for advertisements.
You were right, hon. No HDTV.
This is worse than I could possibly imagine. Watching Trump all day long over and over... this is the definition of torture!
If we were in Heaven we'd be watching "Chariots of Fire"!
I figured it would be hell down here but I wasn’t prepared for a ‘real housewives’ marathon
This IS Hell. It reminds me of Christmas with my in-laws.
Wanna bet, no HBO?
This is it?! They sure talked it up.
If you ask nicely I bet they'll change it.
Is this the only channel?
The worst part is, we can't skip the commercials
I guess the revolutionWILL be televised
I wonder if they wear clothes in the other place.
Rabbit ears? This must be retro hell.
Those Televangelists don't know how right they are.
Is this going to be on the quiz?
Would you like to get a coffee after the meeting?
I knew it...reality TV.
This must be the welcome video.
I think this is only the third circle, so it could be worse. It's nothing but 'Jersey Shore' reruns two levels down.
Welcome to the lowest level -- no pockets for cellphones here.
I hear televisions up in heaven are HD.
What happens now? They hand out the sticks and marshmallows.
I really thought the porn would be better here.
Worst part is, it's always reruns.
It's a rerun.
It's better than being chilly all the time.
I don’t know what’s worse - the body odor or the rabbit ears?
Well, at least this channel's better than the news.
I wonder what's on the other channels?
I still say this is too much to give up for one Knicks championship.
So apparently we all hogged the remote a bit in the land of the living.
It's a lot colder than I expected.
Reality shows are scarier than the real thing.
The Lake of Fire is full. I guess we're stuck with the simulcast.
I'm pretty sure I was supposed to have a place at the main venue, not the remote view with you losers.
You're in hell for human resources staff. Now watch this training video for the next hundred years, and nobody sexually harass anyone else.
I know we've seen this before, but this part never gets old to me.
It's either this or re-runs of "The Apprentice".
Is he really trying to sell us on Hell?
It’s the hottest show on television and it’s commercial free.
Wow, and I thought not having clothes was the worst part of being here.
It looks like the devil made us do it.
Thank God it's not a live shot!
My plan to bring up The Apprentice television ratings has worked!
I thought there would at least be cable.
I hate re-runs...
I thought the idea was to bare our souls
Never changes.....Breaking News 24/7!
HD would make it more believable.
I heard purgatory has basic cable.
The truly hellish part is that it’s standard definition
This is not "fake news"...it is the naked truth!!
A T.V. fireplace? Who knew satan was so cheep
I always thought television was a Hell of an idea.
I used to watch this every Christmas
I knew it was a guilty pleasure.
Obviously CRT is not just my idea of hell.
Our poor souls were addicted to porn & we must now have our eyes watch the Eternal Flames on a 1973 Non-HD 20 inch TV for all eternity!
The main damnation is no Wi-Fi.
They only play the news down here? This really is hell.
Apparently Senator McConnell cut off his funding.
Thank God it's not in HD.
Everything is outsourced now.
Back home they call this buffering.
It's going to be hell without a flat screen.
In heaven they have HD flat TVs, but you need to wear clothes.
Only three networks and no Hi-Definition. It's torture.
Everyone is outsourcing these days
Ever since our free cable trial period ended, life down here is frankly, well, hell.
The irony is McLuhan's in the other place.
And we thought that all day broadcast on Christmas day of the yule log was boring!
All the weather reports seem the same to me.
That's a fake fire.
The folks in the next circle of hell have it even worse: all Kathie Lee Gifford all the time.
This is some after party!
Great offer, a timeshare at a hedonist resort!
Rabbit ears? Really?
They’ve really reduced their carbon footprint.
I always thought the "Yule Log" was hell when I was alive.
This really is Hell, all they show is Reality TV .
God, I miss Netflix!
Fox is fine, but I prefer the Great British Bake-off
I hear this channel is being bought by Disney.
Reruns are hell.
Wow. And here I thought the only "virtual hell" I'd ever be in was my marriage!
Let’s stay in purgatory. Hawaii is just too hot.
At least there are no ads!
I warned you Fox News was the only network that would come in down here.
I thought Hell would at least be in HD.
What's cooking?
He won’t change that channel until hell freezes over
Rabbit ears? What's next, a crummy TV dinner?
Good luck trying to skip the commercials.
The lake of fire is out of order.
I will take questions after this brief introduction video.
The commercials are the worst.
Did someone touch the thermostat?
Not sure about the red test pattern but those rabbit ears suggest cable may not be available in this area.
I feel somehow it continues to reflect on our current reality.
You'd think he could afford cable?
This is the weirdest orientation ever.
Why do you think he’s showing us Fahrenheit 451.
The boss thinks The Apprentice reruns will augment the Hell experience for many of the newer arrivals.
It's the 10th Circle of Hell - only one channel and it's all Trump 24/7.
I never watch the pre-flight safety videos.
I guess Marshall McLuhan was right. The medium's the message.
Oh great. Reruns again.
They make us watch it while they're refueling the "eternal fires of hell."
What's happening on Earth puts all this in perspective.
Fox and Friends laugh at Dante's fake fire.
Well, at least they let us get the news down here.
It's an all-inclusive package.
This IS hell! We should be seeing this on a big, high res, flat screen.
Eternity watching the flames of hell in black & white. But we do have fifty shades of grey.
It's Hell Fire TV. It's a lot like watching cable news 24/7.
Is it a bit chilly in here, or is it just me?
It's an acquired taste.
They say this is the boring part.
Consider yourself lucky. They've got cable the next circle down.
White supremecist convention in hell.
I hate it when the trailer contains spoilers.
not really different from the hell before death, is it?
After the commercial we dance to Earth, Wind and Fire.
You the know the real hell is this analog TV's picture quality.
Beats the Hell out of watching news shows back home.
So the heat is fake, I think we've been had.
I don't think we need to see the replay.
Ron Reagan says it’s fake news.
Hell is other people, and no cable.
It´s a hell of a program!
It's the series finale of Seinfeld--over and over and over again.
It’s not really hell until we loose the reception.
No cable? This IS hell!
I think they serve snacks after this orientation video. I can't wait to try the deviled eggs.
Who'd thought hell would need an overflow room?
After seeing what's happening on Earth it's not so bad down here.
Oh, so that's it. His hair is actually made of hellfire's licking flames.
No cable? This is heaven!
I hear in heaven, they've got plasma screens.
another rerun.
They're out of fuel.
Now, there's a good instructional video. Short and to the point.
This plays instead of Fox News' commercials.
I love this show! It's soo hot right now.
The new DVR system...it's still eternal damnation but you get to skip all the commercials.
I guess Fox News doesn't realize who is down here
When I signed up for the nudist camp's "Devil-Me-Care" weekend getaway, I was looking for a good time. This is not at all what I had imagined. Where are we and what are we doing here??
Apparently they have a colour TV in heaven.
I've already seen this one
It's on TV, so it must be real.
Looks like a better deal than that timeshare we bought.
Figures, reruns again.
In hell, the only channel is the weather channel.
These Hades travelogs are pure hell.
Who would have guessed that hell is watching Yule Log for eternity?
It is C-Span all day here.
I thought they’d at least have cable.
The Bachelorette is on next.
I thought the 'Roseanne' reboot would be better.
I love these home decorating shows.
A least he changes the channel once every hundred years or so.
I wonder if we can change the channel.
Try not to move around too much. It messes with the reception.
I knew Hell wouldn’t have cable!
This is a demo version.
It’s a sneak preview.
Forcing us watch this in standard-definition is just cruel.
Consider it a trailer.
Other than the boredom it sure beats the real thing.
Relax, I hear orientation lasts at least forty millennia.
It really IS hell when you don’t have cable.
These press briefings are getting ridiculous.
This would be more effective in HD.
Well, there's the fire, but where's the brimstone?
I didn’t think cutting the cable would be this dire.
The Devil saw the Yule Log channel last December and had an idea for a more fuel efficient Hell.
275 channels with nothing but hell fire and brimstone. I never thought I would miss Time-Warner.
The only thing worse than watching reruns of Hell’s Kitchen, is when the rabbit ears reception screws up.
reality tv.
As you can see, they all prefer vicarious experience to the real thing.
Would you mind if I changed to The Brimstone Channel?
I wish it was HD at least.
Looks like we just got out in time!
Of course they couldn't go digital- the bureaucracy is hell around here.
Just what I was afraid of; endless reruns.
I can't believe the Devil and cable haven't partnered up.
I now direct your attention to a brief video that will provide you with all the necessary information regarding your eternal stay in hell.
"SPF 10,000. You?
So it's true about the woman scorned thingy.
I know this is Hell and all, but rabbit ears?!?
The reception was better in purgatory -- and we were better dressed, too.
Spoiler alert -- she eats the apple.
Would you like to join me for the Welcome BBQ after the orientation is finished?
At 5:00 they play Gilligan’s Island reruns.
Watch very, very closely. Every millennium they throw on a new log.
Are you going to hot yoga?
Stupid humans. Even when they're dead they can't think outside the box!
Had I known there are no clothes or flat screens in hell, I would have behaved better.
Just as I thought: Hell is so retro.
Maybe if we ask a lot of questions after the video it'll delay things.
I thought it would be worse, the reception is better than expected.
It's just like the yule log channel, but with Nickelback instead of Christmas songs.
Welcome to Hell. No streaming.
The real problem is that he never changes the channel, it's all Hell all the time.
Black & White TV this is hell!
Feels a bit overkill, right?
Oh hell, it's not even in color.
Spoiler alert, no cable.
This place is a virtual hell!
It’s hell that we can’t see this on the big screen.
Rabbit-ear TV?—Satan really has no mercy.
Yeah Analog, that's the Hell of it.
The authorities outlawed an open fire as a health hazard.
I guess reality tv is big down here too.
Don't worry, it's just fake news.
I know it looks bad...but I’ve heard the screen adds ten degrees.
You gotta admire someone who manages to get such great reception with nothing more than rabbit ears!
The Travel Channel gets very repetitious down here.
He's reducing his carbon tail print.
Welcome to Facebook orientation. That's our Chief Privacy Officer.
It's really just the Fireplace channel. But Hellfire sounds doomier.
It was either this or Canadian Netflix.
It's amazing the picture's this good down here without cable.
Didn't we just see this one yesterday?
Is it weird to complain that I'm cold?
Boredom is Torture. And climate change is making the real flames of hell less relevant.
What'd you do?
It's FoxNews and personally I'd have preferred fire and brimstone.
No air-conditioning and 24/7 reruns of 'Rosanne.'" "Welcome to Hell!
Thank God for budget cuts.
It appears cable TV really has gone to Hell!
I'm okay with analog but it's hell for the younger folks.
This will be my one millionth viewing of Inferno.
Don't be alarmed by our one channel. The head devil assures us it's just fake news.
Ugh, watching his home videos is hell!
"NOW, do you believe"?
It's not the eternity of H.R. training that bugs me, it's the added 35 minutes for Jim's stupid questions.
Oh, god, rabbit ear antenna! I had no idea hell would be so nakedly out of touch with digital technology.
I hear that Purgatory has high def and is clothing-optional.
We gotta watch "Naked and Afraid" forever? What the hell?
These introductory videos take the edge off.
We're doomed -- it's basic cable.
When I registered for a layman's degree from Trump University, this is not what I expected.
Now we know where all of those cable channels come from.
Houston won the World Series, Philly won the Super Bowl. What did you expect?
Basic Cable, no HD, this is Hell.
I never thought of him as an environmentalist.
I know it’s not the same, but we’re gonna save a ton on firewood...
Budget Cuts
Somehow, the fact that he can’t even wangle an LED makes me feel better.
I guess I took it literally?
It would be more realistic in color
Wow, who knew hell really is on earth?
Reality TV has gone too far.
Thank goodness the Lord of Darkness provided this overflow room.
They always told me it was just a metaphor.
The first one of you that denounces Jesus gets a smart TV, for eternity.
They have a new Safety Compliance Officer.
We should have gotten the plan with limited commercials.
Budget cuts; petroleum based flames are just too gosh-darned expensive.
It gets worse, there are only 3 Channels
Why is it always the yule log? Seems like its been on this station for an eternity.
It only gets Gilligan’s Island, but at least the reception is good.
I heard this is a hot spot.
This here is Hell's version of 'The Apprentice.' They really mean business when they say, 'You're fired!!!'
He said we only have to wait one more eternal cycle, and we get to upgrade to Satellite.
I always said old black & white TV looked like hell.
He did say dress appropriately but this is crazy.
If we're really good, he'll let us watch the Full House marathon.
Damn! Reruns...
The Trump pee-pee-tape is now part of our Fire Safety education.
Even though we are naked, no one at the New Yorker will like my caption...look at the screen, they are burning all of my submissions
Surprise surprise, Lucifer won't spring for cable...
Thank God for budget cuts.
He's been waiting all day for the cable guy
Fake fire? I guess the economy's bad everywhere, huh?
Let's get this party started.
I always thought that hellfire and damnation stuff was a bit exaggerated.
What in the hell are we watching?
Ah, now that jingle will be stuck in my head FOREVER!
It’s the Republicans’ new slogan: Make Hell Great Again
I green lighted this show just before my heart attack.
Imitating the Yule Log broadcasts seems a bit antithetical to the mission.
Now I know we're in hell. It's the Yule Log!
This isn't even the worst part- they show Gilligan's Island reruns all afternoon.
The funny thing is, when they first announced it I was AGAINST telecommuting.
I guess hell is not Netflix and chill.
Reality TV isn't all it's seems to be.
I always liked the Yule Log better. And lots of blankets!!
I knew it. Slow TV is hell.
It's the Yule Log video and there's no remote.
Reality television. I should've known.
I'm actually a little chilly! Who ever thought Satan would be so concerned about Global Warming?
Viewing the naked truth is never easy
At least in Ray Bradbury’s dystopian future they got to keep their clothes.
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THE DIALS OR WE'LL ALL HAVE TO START WEARING CLOTHES.
He’s just playing devil’s advocate, I’m pretty sure Marshall McLuhan said TV was a cool medium
Netflix and hell, amiright?
I don't know, I suppose I am a little disappointed. After all, this whole thing was supposed to be a really big deal.
Yep, that's the last thing I saw too.
The real punishment is that it's not in HD.
Somehow I expected a more *immersive* experience...
Still not as bad as Fox News.
If I don't see you again after orientation, it was nice to meet you.
It’s so much better seeing it live
Reality TV is so edited these days
I hear the one percent get slow-smoked over locally sourced alder wood.
At least in the winter he shows us the Yule Log.
If he's trying to make us sweat, he should just put that Simmons guy on.
It's hell getting cable down here.
I can't wait for orientation week to end.
Shoulda known they wouldn't have HD in hell.
'I saw this movie on the flight down here."
Is it me, or are these cutbacks getting ridiculous?
Weird sales meeting
“You think this looks bad, wait until you see what’s next”.,
You would think the Devil could afford cable.
I like the time-share pitch, but I don’t want to get burned
Is this a preview of where we are headed?
Now I get what the expression “rot in hell” really meant
What a cheap devil.
...and, that concludes orientation. Questions?
My mother always told me it would rot my soul.
Haven't we suffered enough? There's no cable!
I'd rather burn than have to watch another season of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.
Looks better on TV.
Down here you don't get to change the channel.
H.R. prepared the following orientation video.
I guess it could be worse, we could be at a Trump election ralley.
You knew once he got down here, a spin-off was inevitable. "You're fire!" isn't as good as his original show, but at least the stakes are higher."
It's an eternal Yul Log.
...and there is no cable.
Reality TV? Next he’ll be running for President of Hell.
I think Hell needs an electronic update.
Usually we only get Fox.
I heard in heaven they have a flat screen.
Hell is no flat screen tv.
I hope your not one to fan the flames
Yes, it's pretty boring, but there are no commercials
I've been binge-watching this forever.
You think this is torture? Wait till the commercials start!
I don’t think we’ll be getting any internet service
This isn't so bad, I heard the Ninth Circle has to watch "Vanderpump Rules.
I hear the other place has HD and surround sound.
It's either this or MSNBC.
The End is Near!!!
Watching TV naked. What's the catch?
Nothing left to shed if it comes to that....
Sheesh--the cheapskate couldn't even spring for a flatscreen.
It's sinful, that's why.
Relax, it's just more fake news.
They’re just getting us ready for our trip to Hawaii.”
You will not need any clothing when you arrive at your destination
It’s the only channel we get down here.
This seems to be our virtual eternity.
I told you we should have opted for the handbasket.
Now you will watch hell of a presentation
Reality TV in Hell
I bet it will take an eternity to get cable HDTV down here.
Think we can work remotely from here?
It's not the hellfire I mind, it's the incessant standing.
No cable. They're breaking us in slowly.
The guy with the fork has the remote, this is going to be hell.
Oooh, the new 2019's are out!
If he really wanted to make the sale, he'd at least use an HD television.
Wow, the new Roseanne sucks.
That’s hell for you. No cable. Only one channel for eternity.
It's lucky we landed here during a recession
You can learn to make fire watching YouTube.
I think I like Sunday's yoga instructor more.
It is amazing they get such good reception down here with just rabbit ears!
I'm beginning to wish I hadn't robbed, cheated and stolen to quite the extent I did.
Why do they keep zooming in on Prince Harry’s hair?
Purgatory. A low-tech illusion... Who'd have guessed.
If you think this is a bore wait till you get a load of the Brimstone Channel.
The Devil is in the details- please watch this informational video before continuing the tour.
And now,a word from our sponsor.
It is better than Fox.
This isn't so bad, really. Last week, we had to watch "Roseanne."
This is an ironic punishment don't you think?
As special effects go, it's not that realistic - but I like it!
It’s too hot for clothes anyway.
Amazing, isn't it? Perfect reception every time!
At least we can be grateful it's not in HD.
I liked the Yule Log better.
What channel is heaven?
Hell hath no cable so... rabbit ears?
Fossil fuels have become prohibitively expensive.
It's not the timeshare presentations I mind so much. It's the judgmental attitude of the sales force.
Satan said that if we take off our clothes the fire should be warmer...
You'd think he could afford hi-def.
Ironically, he has pyrophobia.
What the hell is this supposed to be?
Another predictable finale.
I told you masturbation is a lower end sin.
It's the season finale.
That explains everything. The Devil has a small penis.
You want better reception, you gotta move his trident!
He's going all in on brimstone.
How I miss cable! It's the commercials that will really torture you.
I can’t believe we’re still binge-watching ‘A Christmas Yule Log.’
Jeez. You would have thought it would at least be a flat screen.
It's the first time I've watched the Dante Channel.
See, I told you. It was all a simulation.
I guess it makes sense Hell has an overflow room.
Frankly, I think watching Fox News was more torturous.
No ... this the commercial, we’re watching The Bill Cosby Show .
I guess that coal couldn’t be saved after all.
Somehow it looks hotter on television.
This is how I pictured it.
Don't make him laugh. We'll lose reception.
The actual fire was outsourced to China to save on expenses.
I hear in God's waiting room they serve buffet.
It's all about the ambiance
This must be Hell. He's making us watch Fake news for eternity.
This is what we get for watching Fox News
Rabbit ears! No wonder they call this hell.
The Resurrection will not be televised.
Somehow the Yule log makes me feel cozier.
Great, another repeat.
If we break the antenna, the fire will turn to snow.
I hate it when Satan makes us watch his old home movies.
It's like hot yoga but hotter.
What the hell? Simulated fire? Seriously? Do you play Gin Rummy?
Political adds 24-7 — what else would you expect in hell.
The fire is on the brimstone. Go figure.
As far as orientations for newcomers go, this isn't really all that bad...
Energy efficiency hits Hades!
It's better the second time you watch it.
I guess I should have seen this coming when I voted.
It's not even a flat screen?! What year is he stuck in?
I wish they’d at least change it from Fox News to MSNBC during commercial breaks
This may make me sound shallow, but I still love watching the Kardashian's down here.
The picture is so realistic you feel like you're there...
I actually like watching fire on old TVs.
Told ya he'd give in on the TV if we moaned about it loud enough.
No digital? Now this is hell.
They had me at "no more cable."
He likes to say that he put the sin in syndication.
Analog's not bad when you consider the Virtual Reality on Level 7
I'm not getting a warm feeling about this!
Hell has been requred to cut down on CO2 emissions
Its so expensive keeping the hell fires going we found they  work just as well on Skype.
Strangely meditative.
Dante’s 10th circle of Hell — NO flat screen TVs.
I hear they have color TV in purgatory
I'm so glad they finally installed monitors here in the lobby. The seventh circle has been S.R.O. since 1936!
Between rising energy prices and slashed budgets, we're lucky we didn't get stuck with radio
They're charging us how much for just this one channel again?
They never get tired of making us watch the safety video.
Standard def? What new torture is this?
Hell.No remote?
I wonder if we have to stay for the free vacation after watching the timeshare presentation.
Looks like another day of record-breaking temperatures
Hell isn't so bad today, the furnace broke.
Yep, just like the televangelist said.
Makes you kind of miss commercials, doesn't it?
Well I guess it's happening, hell is freezing over!
Everyone looks forward to Christmas Eve when they add the Yule log.
The hell of it is, this is the only channel!
Sorry for the outdated technology - we had another budget cut this year.
That snowball I brought has better chances than I thought.
No HD. Their cruelty is boundless!
Just as I feared, hell means watching reruns of "Naked And Afraid" in the nude.
I guess nobody wanted to be overdressed for this party.
they've been using the same orientation video since the 80s
It's just hell to dispose of a old TV.
Of all things: rabbit ears!
These employee safety training videos are hilarious.
But he hasn't got anything on.
He really gets down to bare facts.
Don’t you just love a great documentary?
I actually produced this human resources video in my other life.
I hope you're wearing plenty of sunblock. This could get hot.
I told you leaving after the election was smart.
The worst part is that they play the same episode over and over.
Comcast wouldn’t cancel our cable TV service.
That Amazon Fire TV Stick is amazing, but he won't let us watch anything else unless we can guess his password.
This is not what I had in mind when the Devil promised Amazon Fire TV.
Oh good. So its definitely not Fox news?
I hear we’re getting a flat screen in April.
Merry Christmas!
The amenities have really gone down here over the years.
Somebody wiggle the rabbit ears...I'm still freezing.
I thought this would be hotter.
As seen on TV
The only channel available is the loop of the Yule log.
I can't wait to read his tweets.
Don't Let Him Get Behind You
We really need to find that remote!
Damn!
Definitely not as good as the first season.
Hey, I thought Hell had flatscreens?
The Yule Log is on upstairs.
This is the weirdest Naked and Afraid party I've ever been to.
If that's the fire, we don't need to worry about the brimstone.
No cable?! This is one hell of a nudist retreat you signed us up for, Dear.
He never wants anyone to say he has a Devil-may-care attitude toward climate change.
I think he was misled by the title "The Naked and the Dead."
There's nothing good on.
I guess I was wrong. Cable companies aren't owned and operated by Satan.
Rabbit ears only, with no satellite dish?,....now that's what I call sadistic torture!
Well, that's a hell of a show.
Why is it so hard to cancel cable?
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?
Ugh. We got the overflow room again.
For some reason I thought they’d have a higher budget
All right, so we're virtually damned, but let's ask for an upgrade.
The carbon footprint of the old style fire and brimstone could no longer be justified.
Cooking shows are a kind of hell.
Same old, same old, without the cushy chair.
This isn't as bad as I thought it would be. At the other place there's no naked chicks.
Welcome to hell for videophiles.
For a lifetime of sin you’d think they would’ve given us HD.
Continuing hot with no chance of rain.
They say it's the golden age of hellivision
Yes, television has gone to hell!
I hear there's also a fracking channel.
After the Bachelor/Bachelorette marathon, they're going to show every season of Big Brother and then every "Apprentice," along with all Donald Trump's speeches and news conferences.
Looks better on a flat screen.
Destined to watch President Trump reruns for eternity
Ohh, it's going to get warmer downstairs.
It’s either this or The 700 Club.
At least we’re dressed for it.
I'm not sure if this is our hell, or his.
Sometimes media is the only way for it to sink in.
It's coverage of the "Hell Week" celebrations.
I'm just glad they let me hold onto my glasses
No Cable, this must be HELL!
It almost looks cozy in vibrant black-and-white, doesn’t it?
The reception is terrible down here!
I'll explain it later.
Whatever you do "don't" touch the rabbit ears.
I've always hated coming attractions
And you thought the Fireplace Channel at Christmas was hell!
Hell is analog TV.
I killed my wife for this.
It's just a teaser trailer.
I swear, Estelle, if you say "banality of evil" one more...uh-oh, now I get it.
The flat screen is upstairs.
One person fails to sexually assault someone and we all have to watch a training video?
With fake fire, you'd maybe think purgatory. But they can't even get a flat screen TV, so this is definitely hell.
'Another repeat.'
I thought we were here because we already watched too much Fox News...
At least all the health insurance companies end up here -- we even have vision coverage!
Fox News will be shown next.
Looks like a hell of a place
I should have know; Hell is analog.
Funny...looks alot like one of my recent campaign ads.
He got one of those "Holiday Fire" DVD's. But do NOT say "Christmas around him!"
It’s the only channel we get down here.
The plotting is weak, but the pyrotechnics are something else.
Apparently there have been budget cuts.
And here you can see what America is like since you left Earth....
Our punishment, for not paying our cable bills.
solar powered. Even he thinks fossil fuels are wrong.
Marshall McLuhan was right.
No binge-watching down here; we have to wait a whole week for the next episode.
That proves it, that maddening holiday yule log was the devil's idea.
Thank God we were bought out by Time Warner broadcasting.
Even the Devil would rather watch re-runs than pay for cable.
Analogue?! Now I'm sure its hell.
Worst part is, it's in standard definitio.
Should we switch to water?
Climate change back upstairs
It could be worse, you know. Imagine if they upgraded to virtual reality!
The liberal media got it right for once.
If we had been good we’d have a jumbo flat screen.
I hear the third circle has a flat screen.
All this for a bite of the apple!?!
THAT IS ON CHANNEL 666
I'd say it's reality TV at its best.
Well, hello. I know this place around the corner that has a killer happy hour. What do you say?
The Campaign was fun.
I was happy to see the flames...I thought for sure it would be “Fox and Friends”
Did you really think there would be a flat screen TV?
They say it'll feel 10 degrees hotter down here as soon as he upgrades to high definition.
I'm still hoping for a Presidential pardon.
See Sharon this is why I hate hanging out with your friends.
«Is it me or is it really hot in here?”
Analog. It just gives me shivers .
This Lake of Fire Welcome Orientation video loop just goes on forever.
Cuz I'm new here. Why don't you ask the red dude with the horns and pitchfork to change the channel?
At least it isn't cable.
Down here, you would think they'd have cable.
A 1950's B&W TV with flames 24/7....this is HELL!
The First Circle is just an orientation class.
Rabbit ears? Hell is going to be worse than i thought!
At first glance it doesn't seem so bad, but it's all in the details.
It's a pretty straight-forward orientation video.
Wouldn't you know, its always the annual fund drive.
They use to have real fire and brimstone...
As on Earth, the most fear-producing device down here is now a television.
With HD, you can really feel the heat.
At least we could watch "Bewitched" in the Fifth Circle.
Ever notice they haven't had to go outside for a single commentator.
Looks much scarier than it did on the iPhone
It's the only channel we get.
Wanna Netflix and burn to death for eternity?
Of course it took awhile to get interesting - these people practically invented the slow burn.
Are these the auditions for Naked and Afraid?
Say, the reception is pretty good down here.
As unbearable as this is, if our sins were even greater, we would have been forced to watch this through 3D Virtual Reality glasses.
Ask him if we can change the channel.
Any chance we could watch it in HD?
We lost the remote, so we're stuck watching reality TV.
They say it won’t be fixed until tomorrow. Meanwhile, shouldn’t we all be making out?
Satan forgot to pay that gas bill, but his cable is on autopay
Hell, only one channel?
It’s a limited series, 20,000 years.
It’s slways reruns in the summer.
Central air will be added to your cable bill as a courtesy.....
No Cable TV....this is going to be hell!
Looks like Hell out there.
I can handle the heat but damn the reception.
What the hell, why doesn't someone turn that infernal thing off?
Sorry, everyone. I ran out of fire this week.
These 'virtual' flames are even more hellish in standard definition.
Talk about eternal suffering! It must be the billionth time I’ve seen this safety video.
You don't get the same effect on a small rabbit-ear tv screen.
My sin? I used to make orientation videos.
Say what you want about the guy, but the economies booming down here. Sure we're all in eternal torment, but unemployment has never been better and we're finally rid of pesky taxes and I don't think we're doing enough to thank him for this.
Ya think he's got any porn?
What did you do to be sent to the Nielsen Family Circle of Hell?
Virtual hell isn’t so bad after all.
At least it's not static.
It only gets PBS
Do you think it's barbecue for lunch again?
God, I hate Goldman Sachs.
I wasn't complaining, I just said I feel a draft.
Now I know why they let me keep my glasses.
I assumed there wouldn't be cable down here.
It's still better than Optimum.
yes, we are virtually in hell!
No spoilers!
Who knew hell would be just like Christmas?
A preview of what's ahead?
I heard they have cable news in the eighth circle.
Sorry for the delay. As you can see slight problem with the rotisserie.
No really, it's cold in here.
They were right. I don't exactly feel consumed, do you?
When do we get to to see the kitchen?
At least it’s not the Rosanne reboot.
Well I for one appreciate a good intro video
Am I glad I didn't die before they had TV!
If Hell is half as exciting as this preview, it can't be so bad!
I don't like the look of the sauna master over there.
They only put the best parts in the trailer, actual eternal damnation probably won't be that good.
Who knew Satan had such a knack for documentaries?
Reminds me of holidays at your mother's.
You think they'll play 'Hell's Kitchen' next?
On level 4 they use real fire and it burns your thingy if you stand too close.
Guessing Netflix and chill is not going to be an option.
Turns out, hell is other people.
Just so long as it's not Fox. Am I right?
We'll get back to our show, "Your Afterlife" in a moment, but first, a word from our sponsor, Ice Mountain bottled water.
I don't know - I feel like Satan's kind of phoning it in. And I was a REALLY shitty person to get here.
I hear they have HD flat screens in heaven.
I hear there's basic cable in purgatory.
They got the idea from the Norwegian Fireplace Channel.
There's a two-hour Brimstone special at eight o'clock.
No Cable? This really is Hell.
Fuel was getting expensive, so he found a Yule log channel with no cats.
I didn’t know they got Fox News down here!
That weird looking usher in red just laughed the most devilish laugh when I asked him how this ends.
This isn't so bad -- it's just like Christmas in Utah.
Thank God for the budget cuts.
Only one channel? This must be hell.
did you really expect hi-def?
Great. I like never watch this show, but what are the odds I've seen this episode?
Can you believe there’s still no full-frontal nudity allowed on Hell-a-vision?
Can't get satellite tv here, so it's only local programs.
It figures it would be a black and white TV.
Well, no-one's ever asked for a fireplace channel down Here before... .
It's not as bad as I pictured it
Hell's Bells! If the flames are only on a TV screen this is a great place to be!!
I've seen this episode before. It gets better, just wait for the brimstone.
I didn’t think we’d get cable!
Normally we go to these timeshare pitches for the free food. I have to say, I’m a little let down with this one.
It was clearly stated in orientation, "no eye contact", John.
So Hell only dates back to the invention of the television set?
Oh, "eruption"! Funny, we all heard "erection"!
We finally meet as I had imagined... on our journey to hell.
We are all standing here naked and freezing and what do they do? Show us pictures of fire on an old TV! What the hell is wrong with them?
"Roseanne" is a little different this time around.
It figures we’d only get Fox News down here.
Who could have imagined that a nudist camp would be hot as hell.
OH HECK!
Trump's tax cuts have had far-reaching implications.
Really? Ol' Beelzebub can't afford hi-def? Loser.
Hours of mandatory infomercials---I'd rather jump in the Lake of Fire.
I was worried there wouldn't be color TV
Even Satan cut the cord to cable.
You know they're just kidding, right?
This is one helluva nudist colony.
I think I understand the premise of that show Naked and Afraid.
No remote, no flat screen, rabbit ears-- we really are in Hell!
I heard things really start hotting up next season.
The flip side of the 60's sexual revolution.
So this IS Hell - no cable and no Dri-Fit
What the devil, the Naked Chef is becoming a movement.
I understand that there's no assigned seating either.
So hell is standing around naked and watching TV?
It would have more impact on a Jumbotron
Hell is black and white.
It's included in basic cable here.
This reminds of of the Lost finale, only better.
So this is why they insisted on us signing a disclaimer at the audition
Well, it's either this or the Brimstone Channel.
I knew it! No one here wears Prada.
And I thought the yule log at Christmas was boring.
But the next episode starts in 10 seconds
The Devil is INTO the details!!
And the best part--you won't need any clothing.
Yeah, he hijacked the Fox & Friends feed for a special announcement.
Hmm, Comcast. How fitting."
A CRT? This IS hell.
I'm not tipping the tour guide.
There's nothing good on TV any more.
The only other channel is brimstone.
This worst part is that it’s mostly commercials.
It's all reruns from now until fall.
Heaven has cable.
Trump’s budget cuts affect us all.
Where you able to smuggle in the sun screen?
When Dignitas said they were having a fire sale, I didn't expect this!
Fake news again! If you can believe anything you hear from these guys, fake news started down here.
We didn't start the fire.
You said you wanted to end up someplace warm and simple.
I should have expected Hell to have a "rabbit ears" antenna.
The damnation part is there is no remote!
O.K., Newt Minow was right.
I think the real fire-works is broken, the fake one is on. what a lazy devil
The reception is not very good down here.
He's too cheap to give us the real thing.
If this is the seventh ring of Hell, I am very content with my sins.
Well actually, it's a monitor not a TV.
I actually know one of the producers.
Don't believe everything you see on the tele.
It’s the vacation video.
It's Sean Hannity on loop
Wait till we are in focus. It's easier to see in the nudist colony exactly where camera adds 10 pounds.
And that completes our fire warden training.
Nothing but rejected FOX pilots
You know it's hell because we still need an antenna.
Everything is so artificial these days.
It’s true what they say -- once you get used to hi-def, watching standard is just torture.
The news really makes me glad we're down here.
Some people just want to watch the world burn...
Uh-oh. They appear to not have cable, and that doesn't look like the Cooking Channel.
The hell you say... This is it?
Hell has gone digital.
No, this is only purgatory. In Hell, the show is in black and white.
Turns out that global warming was way oversold.
He stars in them all and we gotta watch. It's...well, you know!
Is this the only channel?
Apparently you guys pay more attention to screens, so here's a 24-hour broadcast of Hell.
On the upside, reception is good, and there is no volume
One of his details is a dedication to minimizing Global Warming.
Jury duty in Hell is the worst.
Rabbit ears, this is Hell!
Outrageous, all of eternity and we still can’t get a good view of the fire and brimstone
Now I see why Virgil didn't think the satellite locations were worth mentioning.
They always try to scare you in these orientation sessions.
The real thing just made everyone uncomfortable.
This is eerily reminiscent of the Yule log programming on channel 11.
I've heard they have had to cut back.
I thought it would be in color.
It always looks worse on TV.
Rabbit ears. Rotary phones. TV dinners. They put the boring folks here in the Fifties Palladium.
The original BBC version is better.
Have you ever wondered where all the blacks went?
On the upside, unlike the City, you'll find it's a dry heat.
So, it turns out that Hell is being stuck for eternity with 1958 technology.
Who knew the place would be run by Norwegians?
'Don't worry, Sean Hannity comes on at 8.'
We're paying $133,500 a month for Amazon Fire.
Today god called in sick, so I'll sub and you'll watch my favorite show, ''the place you idiots should be'' So you don't annoy me
Let's hope it's just a rerun of that Norwegian log-burning show.
I would have thought that burning in hell would be worse.
They said TV programming was going to hell....
No, the set doesn't have a remote. I told you, the 60's were hell.
Watching the Yule Log 24/7 is hell.
Wow, this is just like being at my in-laws’.
I should have sprung for the 3D glasses
The fire and incendiary news network is the only one they show down here.
I knew there was a special place in hell for TV critics.
My last binge-watch here lasted 700 years
The "heat" I can take, but this one channel, "his channel," gets old.
I bet heaven has better reception.
Hang on folks, this is the White House Press Briefing. Where did I put that 'Welcome to Hell' DVD?
When Sister Claire told me that I'd burn in Hell, I pictured something entirely different! What about you?
Yule log always puts me in the spirit.
Scorned and no remote control - now that's fury.
It gets worse; the reruns are in black & white.
I heard the reception is much better once we get inside.
We always knew, television is hell.
Piece of advice. Don’t ask for ‘Highway to Heaven.’
I never appreciated reality TV until now.
The Cult of Eternal Flames wasn't at all how I pictured Hell. For the first time I fit right in.
Hell is analogue with bad signal and no wifi
"Naked and Afraid" just doesn't seem as good anymore......
If you wanted more channels, maybe you shouldn’t have coveted your neighbor’s wife.
It's not as bad as the WPIX "Yule Log."
Talk about depressing orientation videos.
It’s called an idiom and no, they’re not giving us our clothes back.
The 2011 version was a hell of a lot better.
When we bilked the Alaskan pensioners, I promised you we'd end up someplace warm.
Those regulatory rollbacks at the EPA are more impactful than we realized.
I would sell my soul for a flat screen and a remote.
Do you think Siri misunderstood my request for directions to Helena?
With the EPA's new policies, there has been a shortage of coal.
Seems like an eternity since the cable went out.
No, it doesn't make sense, does it? Trivago commercials.
It doesn't get any better than this.
We should not have gone to this orgy...
It's the Hell Christmas Channel.
Having to binge-watch reruns of my old flame. This is hell alright!
He reruns his greatest hits on Sundays.
Well I was opposed to the AT&T - Time Warner merger.
Rabbit ears! Geez, you'd think they'd at least have cable down here.
I'm told this is the orientation for newcomers.
This programming seems redundant.
It's not even high-def, this really is hell!
It’s called Fire in a Box.
I always knew there would be TV in hell.
Enjoy this, in the next 100 years you will be listing to Huckabee Sanders White House briefings
Great. We're the theme for next year's Met Gala?
I feel better about the snowflakes chances now
Welcome to PC Hell.
Sorry folks, the reception’s a bit dodgy down here, but we make do.
I thought that we'd at least get cable.
This is the best we can do until we get the gas turned back on.
It's just not the same as actually being there.
I don't know what's worse; virtual fire or bad reception.
I'm just desensitized at this point.
Well, at least it's not C-Span.
I hear they get HD next level up.
It's Amazon Fire--they even deliver here.
I always knew that Time Warner merger was trouble.
A virtual Yule log without 4K Ultra HD really is hell.
This new Anti-Harrasment training technique is pretty groundbreaking
Okay, okay, next commercial break Satan we promise
I'm a little surprised Hell doesn't have cable news.
Yet another reality show,
I was wondering what ever became of the Yule Log.
I've already seen this episode.
I hear heaven has 65 inch LED showing clouds
They finally got instant replay.
Seriously no chairs? We'll be standing forever!
It seems fine now. But wait 'til the commercials.
Netflix and Grill?
You'd think they would have cable in here by now.
I kinda like it here.
There's been some budget cuts.
Auditions for 'Naked in Purgatory'
At least there are no commercial breaks
OK, I watched the sales pitch. Can we go home now?
It's so busy here now they've stuck us in overflow.
Now I see why we won't need our clothes.
Well, it's more hopeful than 'The Handmaid's Tale.'
The commercial breaks are quite a relief
They say the fire isn't that bad; it's the brimstone that really hurts.
These cost cuts have been Hell.
This week on “Naked and Ablaze” ...
No cable huh?
Welcome to Hell. Three channels - ABC,NBC,and CBS.
‘This orientation session seems to be focused on a single theme.’
Still reality TV, same as life on earth, only we're naked. I'd say hell is an improvement.
Was it Sartre or Trump who said, “Hell is fake news”?
They show the ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ re-runs as orientation.
Aren't these safety videos just torture?
One level down they only get podcasted recaps of this show.
Another episode of Brimstone?
Cutbacks.
I think I would be more scared if it were in HD.
Coachella sucks this year
I actually don’t mind being in the satellite room.
200 channels and nothing on.
Of course he couldn't spring for bluray
Black and white only, no HD or 3D, not even a remote to fight over. Who knew it would be this bad?!
I was told that it was hot and one hell of a show.
We apologize- Judgement day has been postponed for technical reasons" "This may take a century or so to correct". "Be patient- Were watching you
This place just hasn’t been the same since the OSHA inspection.
See! It is always good to turn the other cheek!
Looks like we got out just in the nick of time.
You don't suppose we could change the channel?
Coal price is up, they need the commercials
He's in EVERY commercial. And it's ALL commercials.
Apocalypse, Fear, Conformity: This is what can happen in society when you combine the "you're fired" mentality with flaming lies.
I'm telling you Janice, it's been all downhill since season 3!
Fox news, 24/7.
You're lucky, it was a loop of the 2017 inauguration.
Virtual reality technology would be more convincing, but the reception's not great down here.
Our punishment is to watch this flame in black and white for eternity.
It's hell when you don't have cable!
I heard he's negotiated a cap & trade agreement with China.
Do you think it's too late to reverse global warming?
I think they call this "hell-lite."
We also get The Dirt Channel and Stench TV...
I just got here, is this the right line?Where's the Beer?
Wow, did not think I would be in front of the WPIX Christmas log for eternity.
24 hour news would truly be hell.
It's hell... We don't get cable.
I guess this is their idea of porn.
Listen up, listen up! Today we'll be watching the Emoji Movie.
The Devil is impressed that all of you are so thin!
That doesn't scare me! I grew up in Hawaii.
We are so behind the times. Hades has had an HD flat screen for an eternity now.
Yes, climate change is real; Trump is president and hell IS freezing over.
I can never tell if they're talking about our domestic or foreign policies
Hey, it still beats Tucker Carlson.
No clothes is one thing, but not having HD is hell.
do I recognize you
Satan said we earned some screen time.
Hell needs a Jumbotron and I know a guy who could get one below cost.
Thank god they let me take off my shirt. I just got the sweat stains removed!
I should've known the devil was in the details.
What did you expect, "living color?"
There's no way in Hell we'll ever get better reception.
Welcome to the gates of hell for the technologically impaired.
How much would it cost for them to buy just a basic cable package?
I can take the heat but not vacation home movies.
That old saying "It will be a cold day in hell" should instead have been "when hell gets cable".
What happened to the infomercials?
Oh great, reruns... I'm pretty sure I know how this show ends.
I heard the next circle down gets it in 4-D.
I gotta tell you Deb, this timeshare is really the pits.
Think he would get offended if I suggest a "flat screen"
I can't watch this. There's too much snow.
One way to deal with that fake news thing.
They were right: the devil is in the details.
I don't think Dante covered this part. Seems a little Irwin Allenish
If he every finds out about HDTV we're really going to roast.
It still beats the Rosanne reboot.
Did you know Orientation was all nude?
It's really just reception Hell - anywhere you go here.
Does the sensitivity training video look just like the flaying of the genitals video, or is it just me?
I heard if your liberal and go to hell, the only channel is Fox News.
Sorta takes me back to my college hazing days.
Hottest show yet.
I guess I shouldn’t have made those YOLO jokes about Jesus on Easter.
Cool, they have a video tutorial about what to expect.
Hellevision.
¨10,000 years and not one commercial. Man, we had it good.¨
Lousy movies always seem to go on forever.
Could be another Christie thing.
i always said watching the yule log was my idea of hell.
I expected weak reception, low definition and no premium channels - but no remote? Pure hell.
I guess gas prices have gone up again
The future looks pretty boring without cable.
At least there are no damn commercials
Unfortunately, it looks like reality TV will continue forever.
It's surprise "Roast" for someone
I think I just saw our neighbors, Roger and Donna. Any thoughts on why they're here!
Was a woman scorned?
Virtual hell is is decidedly less uncomfortable than I deserved.
I'm in. That's what we came here for..
I’m actually relieved. I was afraid we wouldn’t get “Fox & Friends” down here.
I'm surprised there are so few techies down here.
Just think - our own reality show!
They didn't pay the gas bill last month.
To go virtual, he'll have to upgrade his system.
I can't believe they don't have cable!
We're to choose the lesser of these two evils? I think it's a riddle.
You're lucky, it was a loop of the 2017 inauguration.
Do you think were far enough out of our "comfort zone" for your therapist?
Welcome to Hell, we’ve gone analog!
It's for the baby boomers who never really embraced social media.
Sure it's easier, but you don't get that burning flesh smell.
I finally realize why, all my life, people kept telling me to go here.
We're virtually doomed---no cable; no HD.
Wait till the 'sweeps'.
Figures they'd make us watch it on T.V.
It’s only yesterday’s video.
It’s cable news — 24/7.
God, I'm freezing in here. How can we get to that place on the TV?
Seriously??? At least those souls in Purgatory get a flat-screen...
I think the Grim Reaper really oversold this part.
The reception is a little better on Fox.
Oh the irony...Apple tv.
I'm taking up a collection so he can buy us a 4K HD flatscreen with an Apple TV box.
Its better for the environment than burning coal.
I was thinking business casual, but I can see that was wrong.
Great picture. The images are so deathlike.
It’s their low emissions model
Oh man! The camera's going to add at least 10 pounds!
The technology down here is not so hot.
Fake news. I don't know about you but I feel like it's freezing over.
These reruns seem to go on forever.
After your soul is sated with viewing the searing blaze, we begin to stream an endless showing of commercials. Hahahaha!
What do we have to do to get cable around here?
I told you we should have paid for FastPass.
The immolation will be televised
And no leaving during commercials.
I told you he was cheap - a black and white TV.
Queen of England has plan to take back US after over 200 years of break up! Her son has Married a US subject and their off spring can become US President and reunite the two countries!!
I'm surprised they don't get Fox News here.
Do you remember where I put my cell phone?
I think we'll be fine until he pays the heating bill.
wow. it's like real fire-and-brimstone, but without the rotten egg smell!
And it's the only channel, too.
Oh man, another rerun.
Welcome to Hell! Please remember to keep your hands and feet inside the Cart at all times. And remember, don't have fun!
Don't worry. It is fake news!
And I thought the Yule log was bad!
I’d sell my soul for a little 4K resolution.
Purgatory ain't hell, but without NetFlix, it might as well be.
It's just the Apprentice on a loop but he's really proud of it.
I heard things get really heated in the second episode.
This isn't torture for my generation, we grew up with black and white TV.
Don't we have anything better to watch than the local news?
Do we really need an infomercial at this point?
Had I known there was no HDTV, I would have gone to confession.
This is where we came in
We had to put out the real fires cause of global warming, but we figure the tube tv and bunny ears are punishment enough.
Yeah, this is the casting-call for Naked & Afraid .
I shouldn't have burned that Bible.
I hope this thing doesn’t last forever.
He said all the other stations only show "fake news".
I HEAR UPSTAIRS HAS FLAT SCREENS WITH MUCH BETTER RECEPTION, BUT IT'S ONLY AN INFOMERCIAL.
Fake News.......Fake News
Did we really have to show up naked for this?
Keeping the fires on was just driving up his energy bills.
Hell..? I thought we were in Peurto Rico.
I wondered if Kevin Spacey's stuff was still airing anywhere...
At least it's not American Idol.
Ok. Who changed the channel?
I see you all dressed for the occasion.
He used to do reality T.V.
Maybe we should get a dish.
I was expecting FOX News.
You must watch this instructional video on how to behave in hell. Lose all hope of redemption, remember to scream loudly in agony, and absolutely no horseplay will be tolerated.
I wish they would show something new...
"No cable? This IS hell." (Note: italics would come through so I capitalized)
I've sat through a lot of timeshare presentations, and this one isn't nearly as bad.
It must be fake news.
I don't know why I signed up to be a extra in the Andy Warhol reboot.
He's just trying to boost his Nielson ratings.
If I'd had known I'd be watching tube TV instead of flatscreen for all eternity I would have led a better life.
Who farted?
The irony is I love orientations.
This is just a warmup, wait until we get to the 9th circle.
Oh, it’s the fire next time.
Do you think they get the nature channel?
What, no flat screen?
This is one helluva timeshare sales pitch!
I saw this one last week.
Bingeing is what got me here in the first place.
Ok, get ready. This is the best part.
Humanity outgrew Hell so now they have these satellite locations where they just pipe in the feed on closed circuit televisions. Oh, this? It's cold in here.
What did you expect Purgatory to be like?
Climate change is a hoax.
Hell's going green.
This was definitely not in the brochure
Honestly, it beats reruns.
I'm glad virtual reality never really caught on down here.
Is this the ONLY channel?? This MUST be hell!!
Where's the signal coming from?
Remind me why we signed up for this?
Hey, it still beats CNN!
Spoiler Alert! I already know how this series ends. He receives the Nobel next...the mushroom cloud isn't until season eight.
Bonnie, where in Hell is Clyde?
Sure, the fire will prevent eternal shrinkage, but they don't warn you about the side effects of brimstone.
We watched this episode last week.
This is a repeat.
*sigh*... Al Gore got it right!
I barely remember when pornography gave me a buzz.
You're lucky you're new here. We only got the antenna last week.
I guess the revolutionWILL be televised
If this is all they've got, I'm gonna need a sweater.
Ours is such a low budget religion. They also won't provide clothing.
We should ask if they get the snow channel.
Cannot believe how many showed up fo the PrepH ad audition.
Welcome to the 10th Circle - Old Appliances.
It was this or Barney.
Anthony Bourdain always makes it look like it's more fun than it really is.
Abandon cable and streaming all ye who enter here.
Having to stare at these flames on an old black and white TV for all of eternity is pure hell.
I miss the log.
At least they let me keep my Glasses...
They must have cut the special effects budget.
And I thought my biggest problem was male-pattern baldness
Uh, oh! Frozen is on next.
HELLUVA PLACE FOR A VACATION !
Thank god it's not CNN.
We saw this last week!! I thought we were going to watch "Heaven Can Wait" tonight.
First eternal damnation, and now no cable?
How much longer is the movie?
Looks like an eternity of reality TV.
Unseasonably warm with no cable TV feed...this must be Purgatory.
It's Direct-From-Hell TV.
They lost the remote control.
reminds me of Christmas in California
It's Hell not having a large screen!
That's cool!
Loving Comic-Con's retro theme this year.
Budget cuts have hit our department hard
I don't think Lucifer knows how propaganda works...
Just great. They have telecommuting here, too?
But the reception is great!
Yeah... They are still in the pre-smart phone era down here.
I had ultra hi-def. This is hell.
Standard definition TV? This is gonna be worse than I thought.
Sartre said, "Hell is other people"; I say, "Hell is a second season of "Flame"!"
Where l come from we just call this fake news.
I hate closed circuit TV.
This one doesn't make much sense unless you've seen prequel.
Next month, it's the golf channel.
The standard definition's a nice touch.
Now just where would I get aluminum foil?
This has been in reruns forever.
Figures - more reruns!
Nancy Reagan was right.
Do you think he'll get mad if we vote to turn on ESPN?
This is what happens whenever oil hits $70 a barrel.
They only have basic cable.
It's hell, no Netflix.
It's better than Fox News Thursdays
"Not sure how useful a safety video is in hell. His lawyers probably make him do it just in case.
Keeping the rabbit ears adjusted properly to be able to see the flames clearly is hell.
I get the long wait time, clothes optional, and the creepy guide, but whence the closed circuit yule log?
So is this your first time here at burning man or..?
Seriously,the programming is boring, but the commercials are a hoot.
We get cable news. I wonder how they torture in the eighth circle.
I don't think I want to go to hell anymore.
No hi-def? Rabbit ears? Naked and freezing? I guess this really is Hell.
The wages of sin — no Netflix!
Season six of the Apprentice. You?
Ask him if he has the Comedy channel.
He's skinnier than I remember.
I told you it wouldn't be so bad.
What really burns me is that they have only one subscription to Netflix.
Keeping eternal damnation hot has gotten really expensive --so we're using this TV image to save energy and remind you that even Lucifer cares about his environment.
The times change, before he personally guided us in a satanic prayer and then we did the orgy
I think we're in meta-hell.
I heard all the other channels have the same programming.
I expected cable, but the remote would always be out of reach.
But Dante’s didn’t have a TV.
I hear we're saving on fuel costs and reducing hell's carbon footprint but I'm a little chilly.
It's hell to watch without a high-definition TV.
How long until it's on Netflix?
They are still using rabbit ears!
It used to be C-SPAN.
I understand they're getting cable sometime this millennium.
Oh, good. It's HDTV.
Reruns only in Hell
Hell’s Yule Log - A Netflix Original
Joke’s on him. I love reality TV.
At least its better than Ishtar.
When this presentation is finished, we can enjoy our free weekend!
I'm not sure a Zenith was the right choice.
It's either the Flame Channel, the Shopping Channel, or Fox News.
After hiring a few consultants, Satan has decided to ramp up his digital strategy to make the platform more accessible.
What a sham! I'm calling my priest.
The torture is the size of the TV, right?
Not that I'm complaining, but it appears the energy crisis is not limited to just the living.
At least they're doing something about global warming.
Like everything else around here, this orientation presentation is pure hell.
They're going to start us off with continuous reruns of the Republican Presidential debates.
It cut the heating bill by 90%
At least there aren’t any commercials
Worse than I expected .
On the bright side...at least we can see the TV.
I'm not sure what's worse about Hell, the eternal torment or the fact that this TV is clearly from the 1950's.
I've seen this at least 100 times let's get out of here
Don’t worry. It’s probably just more ‘fake news’ from CNN.
I could be wrong, but I don't think that's a Yule log....
This is better than I thought. I was thinking Hell would be the continuous watching of Law&Order SVU.
It's good, but I don't think he should submit it to Sundance.
Ooooh, I hope they’re playing reruns of “The Beverly Hillbillies”!
I forgot my razor.
Not that I'm complaining, but couldn't they at least have gotten a flat-screen?
I'd guess door number two.
I heard this place would be bad, but not this bad.
First, you need to visualize each other with clothes on.
This is not going to be a Hollywood ending.
I prefer the Yule log.
Knowing this would be the outcome I think I still would have opted for "Netflix and chill".
“I saw the original. Having to watch it again in black and white is torture”.
At least we'll be warm.
I wish I checked if they had cable before signing up for eternity.
Standard-def... They thought of everything.
Hell is black and white.
An eternity of advertisements? Hell!
Compared to my political life, this ain't so bad.
Is this one of those fireplace screensavers?
This must be hell. It's another episode of Judge Judy.
Fox News all the time.
We’re waiting for the Fox News coverage to begin.
If this wasn't hell, I'd have left already.
Anybody else getting kinda hot?
Ozone alert.
I think I need his fork for a better signal.
I hope we don't have to watch that again.
It's usually "Caillou."
They change the channel to "Brimstone" when they want higher ratings.
The fire I don’t mind, but that brimstone sure chafes …
Really though, it's the other people.
Nudist Airlines! Another of your great ideas
This is Purgatory -- on Channel 7 is Hell
Where's the nuance?
I like the brimstone network better.
These budget cuts really decrease the effectiveness.
Surprisingly good reception for rabbit ears.
It reduces our carbon emissions to fall within government guidelines.
Oh, no, each season is always a slow burn. Just give it a few more episodes.
Oh gracious. I mean OF COURSE it's not even in HD.
Now that you've completed orientation it's time to meet your fellow sufferers.
I love these intro videos.
I told you it would be nothing but Fox News.
Perhaps it's time to get cable?
Believe me, it's far worse than real flames for us A/V geeks. The aspect ratio is all wrong.
No spoilers, ok?
Given our situation, you wouldn't think I'd be aroused by a cheesy fireplace-video. But looky here!
Is this the episode where Ross and Rachel...
Why didn't they mess with the vertical hold? Seems like a missed opportunity.
Those rabbit ears are so retro.
The symbolic fire I get, but the endless commercials? All I did was sell network time.
It's by the same show runner that did the yule log.
So hard to believe that in all places, there's no cable in Hell.
It's going to take eternity until they subscribe to cable.
Hell be damned! I could get used to this place.
It lacks a human element.
I'm really glad Hell has gone high tech.
The lake of fire is full. We have to watch from the annex.
This is Hell, no live streaming.
You go to porn if you watch hell.
Sort of makes me miss the Yule Log
It's a hell of a good signal for down here.
These guys must be fascinated by the possibilities in global warming.
The flames aren't the punishment, it's the knowing we could be watching them on 4K LED 55" flatscreen.
Apple TV.
This must be one of the lesser rings of hell, it hasn't gone to commercial even once yet.
It just doesn’t have the same effect since Nelly’s copyright lawsuit.
Looks like Hell is watching FOX & FRIENDS on perpetual loop!
When I said you were hot... and you told me to go to hell... well, I meant it.
I heard the big-time sinners get the Jumbotron.
Telehell
What I really hate is they never say “spoiler alert” down here.
This won't be too bad. I can do all the reading I was putting off.
Think we'll get an air conditioner next?
No I'm not Andy Cohen's boyfriend, I'm his husband!
He said "due to the Devil's executive bonus last year, certain budget cuts are in effect."
I know we took a few years off, but I didn't realize Burning Man had become so literal.
Frankly, I'm OK with the budget cuts.
I sure do miss Netflix and chill.
I knew I was going to damnation, but never suspected "the fire" was fake news!
See I told you, first we got here in a handbasket, and now they don't have cable.
I didn't pack any summer clothes.
Trump proved we really were the Great Satan
Rabbit ears, this is Hell!
It's not exactly purgatory, but you are fairly warm
It's been like this since he ran out of brimstone.
Regular TV? Nooooooo!!!
The Apprentice with Trump and Omarosa again? Why didn’t I say my prayers???!!!
At least they haven't discovered virtual reality.
This is one hell of an introduction to hell! Where are the toilets?
And you used to hate commercials.
It’s either this or the Kardashians.
This global warming thing has gotten completely out of control.
Once orientation is complete, we shall begin again.
I hear KISS is playing at halftime.
There wasn't enough room in the main hall, so this is the best we could do.
I kinda liked the flames before Hell went private and Netflix serialized them.
His attempt at virtual reality.
Don’t you love the underwear ads?
Nice reception.
This really is Hell! No streaming, satellite or cable.
This must be his version of the Yule log...
I hear in the third ring the flames are in HD.
It's only the 10 millionth time they had played "Burn Baby Burn!"
it doesn't look like a sauna party to me.
You'd think they would have a flatscreen for the official orientation.
It's dress down Friday.
"So *this* is hell: not having cable!
He tells the FoxNews watchers it's Hannity and they believe it.
Things could be worse.
It's hotter in the movie version.
The coming attractions are endless.
What do you think Rorschach would say?
Who knew? Talbot's "no return" policy is quite literal.
At least he could have had it in color.
As least there aren’t commercials...
I have no regrets, now.
It's better than having to watch Rosanne!
Why are we always naked down here?
See, I told you we were overdressed.
Well, that’s a relief
Ray is really taking "radical transparency" to a new level.
I don't know whether to be relieved or insulted.
I still say it was worth it.
I must admit it, it looks pretty scarry but you were worth it!
I mean it, no more time share presentations.
No HD flatscreen.
Yep, you really feel it with these new ambient TVs.
This is the best part of eternity.
You can tell he's getting lazy. This is exactly what I did with my kid.
Huh. It's not even Hi-Def.
I heard they haves some really hot reruns.
Do you think sunblock will help?
A television with rabbit ears? This is Hell!
One hell of a sauna, isn't it?
These "Fire & Fury" re-runs are getting kinda old.
Market research at Fox News.
It's either this, or re-runs of Baywatch.
We must be in hell. There's no cable.
Still better than real housewives of Orange county.
I'd rather be in he'll than watch another training film!
No, I’m NOT relieved; I still hate cultural relativism.
This would be so much better in HD.
I understand the orientation viveo was produced by Harvey Weinstein.
I’m eternally grateful for what he’s doing to reduce his carbon footprint.
Is this on Netflix?
Impeachment proceedings linger on...
They really should update their introductory video.
Have you noticed that it is not as hot in here since the old man got into wide screen and hi-def?
I hope we are dressed for the occasion.
Sweeps week again - great.
Much better than the Yule Log.
It’s only temporary. We’re waiting for the coal delivery.
Can we get a different channel?
Seriously, in the molten center of the earth, a rabbit ear antenna?
I guess Hell really is not having 24 hour programming.
Given their unlimited funding, I was expecting 4K with HDR.
They told me there would be cable.
I liked the last season better.
It was nice of them to let me keep my glasses.
It's The Apprentice. The Republicans are in the other room watching Morning Joe.
Shall we watch the royal wedding again?
Spoiler alert for venial sinners!
Nudist resorts always get the best timeshare presentations.
You really think after just 6 weeks we’ll have flaming hot abs?
And I thought it was bad when there were only 3 networks.
Hell is worse than I imagined. Black & White, for eternity.
I love this part!
...I knew all along that getting rid of analog TVs was Satan’s doing...
Even the flames are naked.
The reception is great, but the picture is really hell.
It's just the trailer.
This is hell, no flat screen TV and I'm freakin' cold.
I was hoping he’d at least have cable.
I swear I saw this same video that last time I did jury duty.
'Eternity? Pah! I stuck with The Walking Dead for 8 seasons...'
I’ll be damned! You just don’t see low resolution sets with the 4:3 aspect ratio anymore. This is going to suck.
This is nothing. Wait until we have to watch the Yule log during the entire holiday season.
Climate change is real.
It's one hell of a first day. Fire safety video, then dress code and a harassment lecture from the boss.
We're in training to survive global warming.
Nice atmosphere, but the strip search feels a little TSA.
I guess we can look forward to an eternity of reruns.
Oh good, this is my favorite one.
Didn't you hear? The board cut Hell's budget last Friday.
Did anybody ask if we could watch hell and damnation on a flat screen?
I told you it would be like this - everything is in black and white and there's no remote.
Goebbels told me they have a flatscreen in the 5th circle if you want to get out of here.
Phew......purgatory.
Could you turn the volume up? It's getting chilly in here.
No cable?
The Bible was wrong. It seems the wages of sin is no cable.
The real torture is watching the flames of hell in standard definition.
And I thought hell was only watching reality shows....
This program is on an infinite loop.
I hate watching re-runs, don't you?
It’s more energy efficient, but I think my sins deserve greater realism.
At least this receiver gets snow.
Have you seen this one yet? It’s kind of a cult classic.
That's show business - better than the real thing, usually.
No cable?
You know, part of me was hoping for a little more misery
Same channel, different day.
Hell is having no internet access
And then she said you can go to hell.
Definitely hell, McLuhan would be rolling his eyes
If he would use the trident instead of the rabbit ears antenna we might be able to get something more interesting.
They won't pay for cable or HDTV, so all we get is this one channel in standard definition.
The hell part is that it's not in 4k Ultra HD.
It’s a “clean air” initiative.
I heard that Hell freezes over during this 90 minute introductory video.
Excuse me, but is this the open casting for the new Netflix docuseries?
I came prepared for the heat. I wasn't expecting virtual-reality hell.
The sound track is unbearable.
I don't think we're at Club Med anymore.
I was expecting a more high tech preview of our accommodations.
This "no smoking" thing has gone too far.
Ladies and gentlemen, a preview of the upcoming warm reception.
Don't complain. The only other program that's been broadcasting this long is The Simpsons.
I hear the diversity training at Starbucks is way more intense.
I heard you could have skipped this part of the orientation if you filled out their online questionnaire.
When it comes to timeshares, the devil is in the details.
He's really sold his soul for the ratings.
I could honestly watch this forever.
We should have signed up for the Platinum package.
I never expected there would be an orientation to hell.
If you're really bad they make you hold the antenna.
It could be worse — I hear the Ninth Circle is “Judge Judy” reruns.
Do you think he’d get mad if I asked him to switch the channel to the Winter Olympics?
You're telling me God didn't clarify that Fire & Brimstone is a soap opera?
No worries, it's fake news!
I don’t think it’s ‘The Christmas Log’ channel .
It’s better than reality.
Fire and brimstone I could accept, but reality TV for eternity is an unfair torment.
This weeks contest will be all Kardashian comments.
Who knew so many hated the yule log.
I didn't believe there'd be a special place in hell for remote hogs.
Saves on fuel costs.
They have HBO, but someone lost the remote.
I've heard of ratings hell but this is ridiculous.
Your first step in orientation is this short video called 'The Yule Log of Hell.' After that, we will get to the hands on portion of the presentation.
It's a lot better than the original.
What the hell... no flat screen!?
The flames are much lower budget up here in the first ring.
Prep for when fossil fuels run out.
It may not be exactly frozen, but it is way cooler, now.
He’s explaining what to expect with the new clean air regulations.
I hear everyone in heaven gets their own individual VR headset, but clouds are boring. I much prefer watching a fire, don't you?
It's a promo for our annual fire sale.
Yeah, that's what McLuhan said, too—don't be fooled by the bunny ears.
This is old footage. I saw it live last week.
It would look better on HDTV.
If this is what they meant by the welcoming reception, I'm going back to purgatory.
"He says it's fake news, and I believe him. After all, he cut our taxes, and he's not going to let any immigrants in.
Okay, Okay, Who changed the channel from Fox News?
At 7, they start showing "The Apprentice" and other shows from Hell!
I'll bet he plays the 'Yule Log' at Christmas!
Looks like Hell out there.
I fell into a burning 24-hour news cycle of fire.
In heaven, they have cable and a flat screen.
I guess it was foolish to hope that Hell had cable.
I knew it was supposed to be bad. But not even basic cable?
What can be a more sinister punishment than watching an old, B/W TV forever?
I knew it; Hell is watching a terrible program for eternity without the remote!
It's better then winter in Minnesotan!
Oh my God, no cable and no remote —even worse than I thought !
I don't mind the nudity, but you'd think they'd at least have the courtesy to get HBO.
I expected burning in hell was at least a 4K experience.
‘Orientation Week to Eternal Damnation’ somehow seems perfunctory.
Actually, it's for the energy savings - he's going green.
Apparently we all worked for home shopping networks
It's torture having somebody tall stand in front of you.
More fake news!
It's an election year
Health and safety presentation- who'd have thunk it!
Sure we save on the gas bill but the atmosphere just isn’t the same.
all you get down here are re-runs...
Wonder if they hold the "burning in hell" licensing rights down here?
I think in this case TV works so much better than VR
They could at least use the wide-screen version!
No cable HD? Wow, they think of everything.
You have all been such great guests so all enjoy unlimited "fun" in room 666.
Yes, Margaret, I’m sorry I hogged the remote.
Welcome to the afterlife. Those assigned to go to the right: Here is a teaser for the rising of heavenly pleasures. To those assigned to the left: Behold the furnance of hell.
That's Hell, all right. They don't even have flat-screen TV.
I was banking on this show getting cancelled.
It’s an old show from before the neo-Trumpian era, with the tag line “you’re fired”.
I'd rather watch the aquarium channel.
I don’t suppose you brought a remote.
It's kinda boring, don't ya think?
I said engorged not inflamed.
I thought this was supposed to be an orgy.
You'd think they could afford 1080p heat.
At least it's not snow.
Of course we have a back-up system down here - it’s the Yule Log.
Alexa, ‘Is ‘All in the Family,’ on’?
I never really like reality television, but I'm starting to warm up to it!
We'll be focus grouping the new Real Housewives.
The do this every year on July 14th, National Nude day... It's supposed to be our version of the Christmas Yule log...
I smuggled in marshmallow pasties.
I love previews!
I guess the devil is in the details.
I can take you to heaven.
I don't believe that suntan lotion is part of the package.
We should get closer to feel the warmth.
I get so tired of watching The Weather Channel.
I hear our eternal damnation is getting upgraded to HD
Is this your first time at Discount Hot Yoga?
I want a divorce.
The previews look pretty exciting.
They finally ran out of space down there.
Wait until the part where it breaks loose.
I have to admit: I always liked "Naked and Afraid."
Did you microwave the frozen rabbit?
It's not what it's cracked up to be.
It's not as cozy as the electronic Yule log.
I hear they have HD upstairs.
Did you ever think that Hell would be an eternity watching the Yule Log on TV?
No flat screen? This is hell.
If we want brimstone, we have to get cable.
Oh thats just GREAT, they had to throw in a spoiler.
The Naked Truth: even in Hell, the devil can't compete with TV
I bet that boring Yule log was the devils work
Of course it changes! At five they make us watch Fox News.
I guess the brimstone is in UHF.
Budget Cuts- I guess Hell has still not recovered from the reccession.
In order to cut back on operations costs, we've had to make a few financial cutbacks and role out green initiatives.
Only one channel on a black and white tube TV? Yeah, this is definitely hell.
The presidency has commenced.
There you have it -- having no Internet is truly hell.
Do you think we can watch something other than the USA news coverage?
Feelin' the Bern?
It's hell to watch on these old tube TVs.
You must watch nonstop Fox News.
We don't even deserve a 40 inch?
I've already seen this movie. Trust me, tonight's not the right time to get pregnant.
This is one reality show too many.
I hear that the devil considers global warming to be a threat to the franchise.
Can you believe I used to pay for this station?
No, we’re the half-time show.
"You're fired!" really means something when the really big one says it.
I hope everyone is enjoying their complementary weekend. Now, please take a look at this short video about our timeshare program.
"Visualize eternal torment"? The self-help industry has gone to hell.
They need to tune it in to a station. This is their version of Snow.
See? I told you climate change denial was a sin.
Worse yet, there's no remote!
God, poor reception is the least of our worries!
I didn’t expect Hell to have an HR welcome video.
Only millennials require orientation.
This is the third circle where liberals are condemned to Fox News for eternity.
The supposed conflagration in heaven - fake news!
So this is the fate of reality TV producers.
What, no Netflix? This is Hell.
Just our luck. Another one of those reality shows.
What time does “Brimstone” come on?
Looks like Hell is right on track to reduce carbon emissions by 2024.
Welcome to the hell of 'masochistic technophiles'
Welcome to the Fire and Fury tour.
I think he said that this is reality TV.
It's Trump's version of Big Brother.
It’s just like watching the Super Bowl—the beer commercials are the best part!
‘Fire & Brimstone’ comes on right after QVC.
Since we switched to virtual fire, Lucifer has really making great strides in dealing with climate change. When the Trump administration finally get here it will be pure torture for them all!
The weather forecast here is so predictable.
I used to love the Yule Log channel.
I was miss led believing to have signed up for a nudest camp.
Conservation of Energy says that Global Warming has to come from somewhere.
It really is hell without cable
He’s in better shape than all of us.
Hell? It seems like the L train to me.
I heard they brought this in to reduce their carbon emissions.
Do you think we get any other channel?
The trailer shows all the best parts.
Rabbit ears and no clothing? budget cuts followed us to hell apparently..
It's worse than I thought...pay TV!
Nothing but re-runs.
Man, I'm glad I don't work in the White House.
Oh, great a training video.
I'm hoping the high water class is next.
Only the fireplace telecast? I should have known better than to ask for a Christmas celebration here.
What in hell is that on the TV?
I would have thought the devil would have High Def
No HD, this is hell!
Am I in heaven?
I hate summer re-runs.
Just be glad he didn't play the x-rated version.
Nice to know the news is still the same.
And I thought watching the Yule Log was hellish when I was a kid.
It’s hell not having HDTV
And that was when they realized even a hellish fantasy is better than naked reality.
I live for the beer commercials.
I was fired once. It isn't that bad.
Everything’s going straight to the small screen these days.
I always liked the previews.
Pass me the remote.
Is Jeopardy still on at the same time at least?
Do you think spf 50 will be enough?
You know you’re in hell when they don’t have cable.
Yes, even down here we rest on the Sabbath.
So, you played a lot of video games too, eh ...??
If we pretend to like the show, he might change the channel.
Somehow the eternal flames don't seem as bad when they're not in high-def!
You'd think they'd have cable here but the Devil's in the details, eh?
I hate the commercials.
It would be so much worse in HD.
Apparently, fire and brimstone and safety videos got somewhat lost in translation.
Welcome. You have all done hot yoga at least one time in your life.
Playing Ring of Fire over and over is really twisted.
It’s true torture. We watch but the plot never changes.
Makes me wonder if "The Yule Log" was just a premonition.
Only one channel and rabbit ears only? No cable? I guess this really is hell.
Leave it to Belial to ruin s'mores night.
Yeah, I dig the nudity, but I’m kind of surprised they don’t have cable down here.
I hear this is the “green room” to the real fire and brimstone.
When does Roy Cohn come on?
This is one hell of a meet and greet.
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?
It's a "spare the air" day.
Fire is Circle One. Brimstone comes with basic cable in Circle Two.
It will be a hell of a lot more realistic when we upgrade to HD next week.
The image is crystal clear. The cable guy must be around.
I ate meat on Friday.
This is hell alright but imagine if it was CSPAN.
Just a preview of what you're all in for, so wearing clothing is not an option.
We were going to use Fox News, but they sued us.
This must be hell, it's not HD.
I figured it would be bad, but I didn't think it was going to be no flat screen, no cable bad.
Without cable and HD, fire and brimstone is underwhelming...I am starting to feel better about my choices!
Wow, that's really hot.
The fires of Hell aren't even in HD? This IS torture!
Nude we say more?
Oh my God - we have to suffer through retro again?
We have to watch that Yulelog for eternity. It really is hell.
I'm cold!" "Jezus it's only been 5 minutes, can't you at least wait till after the instruction video is over?
I hear on Christmas Eve they switch to the "Yule Log."
Like we were supposed to know it promotes false gods . . .
I hope you remembered to pack a lot of sunscreen, for us.
Do you think we get HBO?
No big screen? No HD? This place really is Hell.
You expected Cable?
I hear they have HD upstairs.
We're still working on the virtual reality surround images. Until that happens we're asking you to visualise the situation!
I think he's trying to tell us something
The cable guy is coming to fix it sometime between 2018 and 2021.
It's Christmas.
I'm going to run to the restroom, want me to grab you popcorn or anything?
Well, that’s a relief
I hear in Heaven they have 4K flat screens. This is downright painful.
Even Beelzebub is sticking it to Trump, he stopped importing coal.
We gotta be in hell-no hi def!
Well, it’s certainly more entertaining than watching snow on the TV
Now that we know the rules, let's start having fun!
Looks all the same to me!
I prefer the burning log
Yes Trumps White House
Look on the bright side, it's not Fox & Friends in HD.
At least they get CNN.
It could be worse. It could be Facebook.
It’s painful enough to watch in hi-def.
I was never really a big fan of coming attractions.
The infomercial for this place seems to run eternally.
Ha, and you said the smoking ban would ruin the ambience
Don’t worry. We’ll only be here til the warranty runs out.
It's a re-run of "The Bridge Over the River Styx"
Is there anything else on besides the weather channel? It is not as if we can dress appropriately. To hell with bare-bones cable.
I used to hate these kind of fake images.But now I kind of like them,
I don’t think looking at it is making me any warmer.
The cable guy said he'd rather die first.
But first---a word from our Sponsors.
It's either this or reruns of Leave It to Beaver.
New members welcome weenie roast, come as you are
You're Fired!
Will there be more commercials or fewer?
Satan's fat burning video, it's hellish!
Just wait til he passes out the 3D glasses.
Analog TV? Now I'm certain where we are.
All the commercials are for " fire sales ".
Maybe if we turn the antenna
. . . and now back to the "Apprentice" marathon featuring Donald Trump.
You would think they at least would have air conditioning for the orientation.
This is overflow hell. Only big time sinners get to be court side.
I see my fashion sense is in sinc with the rest of the world.
I hear the previews are nowhere near as hot as the coming attrition.
And now backs to our regularly scheduled program, 'The Sean Hannity Show'
Had I known that hell had no cable, I never would have robbed that bank!
Every circle has its broadcast, wrathful souls have Fox news on 24/7
‘Redecorating Hell’ is the best show on this network; I wonder which tile they used for the new torment pit.
Damn it, you change the channel this time.
Hell has gone to hell.
That's right, only reruns of State TV.
Yes, I can think of worse things than never using your turn signals. But more annoying? No. Welcome to hell.
Reruns.
I'm getting chilly. Can you turn the volume up?
At least it's not Fox News.
Yes those are Christmas carols- he got the idea from WPIX.
Me? Micro management?
Being forced to watch this for eternity in black and white, with no flat screen or HD, is truly hell.
Hell hath no fury like a Kardashian scorned.
Don't tell anyone I was an arsonist.
No hand-held, no cable, rabbit ears...this IS hell!
Cant believe the Kardashians ruined everything down here too
If you think this show's bad, wait til you see how long the commercial breaks are.
After the presentation, there's a drawing for a lifetime membership.
I don't know what we're expecting each week with this weather report
This is my favorite show.
Yes, it's reality shows, 24/7.
Now that it's frozen over, this has to be your experience.
Caliente... The only channel we can get down here.
Yeah, we're naked and really afraid.
I coveted my neighbour’s furnace.
This is hell, no flat screen tv.
It all started with that yule log channel.
Friction matters.
Adorno never warned of the farts.
I guess it’s dramatic, but at these prices I was expecting it to be live.
I am tired of all the nudity on cable!!
I heard they needed all the lava for Kilauea
My Father always said, “People in Hell want ice water.” I’d prefer HD television & a cold beer.
I heard that he's installing cable any day now.
Do you think this is the episode where they reveal we're really in the Good Place?
Oh man, another rerun.
Netflix hell.
At least they have plasma TV.
With rabbit ears all we pick up is the local Sinclair Broadcast station.
This may not be so bad after all-we get to see a preview of coming attractions!
There's not a chance in Hell I'm watching this!
This is what burns my ass.
Want to go get a drink? I've seen this show a thousand times, and it never gets any better....
I guess no one here has any tin foil we could put on the rabbit ears to improve the reception
And I thought watching that burning Yule Log on Channel 11 was hell.
These budget cuts are hell.
At least this is better than reality TV.
The summer reruns truly are intolerable.
What the hell is this place?
This is going to be a hell of an orgy once the TV set shuts off.
Amazon Fire TV.
These reruns are hell.
There's talk of a barbecue following orientation.
Whelp, looks like we forgot to pay the Comcast bill again.
Who knew there’d be a trailer.
Is it just me, or we in hell?
I hear we are the lucky ones.
I think Downton Abbey is on channel 666.
Netflix and roast?
Rumor has it that Moonves sold his soul for Nielson ratings.
Great, the Fire Channel.
He's not quite up to speed with technology.
It's a win-win from B-bub. We get better television than 'A&E' or 'Lifetime' AND he's saving a fortune on real brimstone.
Reality TV in Hell
Now that the virtual tour is over,let's get down to business.
You know it would be a lot more "fair and balanced" if there was as must brimstone as there was fire.
It must be their televised orientation program.
Due to budget cuts, Hellfire is now brought to you by Low-Definition TV.
This is hell for everyone who accidentally signed up for Amazon Prime.
He explained before you got here that virtual fire is cheaper, eliminates carbon dioxide, and better for the Naked Mole Rats.
First he makes us take our clothes off. Then he makes us watch fire on an old 4 by 3 tube TV. That's one kinky devil!
It’s hot as hell in here
Turns out he didn't have enough wood for the eternal fires
Misplaced punctuation matters. "Discount Sauna, as advertised on TV” should have been "Discount Sauna as advertised, on TV.”
I've seen this episode already.
I'd wager the medium really isn't the message.
That’s right, your living hell is more commercials than the Olympics!
I know we're saving the climate by not burning fossil fuels. But, for the life of me, I can't figure out for whom!
It’s not so bad since they got rid of Bob Costas.
I watched this episode. It's a hell of a story.
According to the Weather report, we won't need a coat tomorrow
It’s not what you think; it’s like watching the fireplace on Christmas Eve.
I always look forward to the commercial breaks.
This is what I get for sharing my friends Netflix account.
Hellish reception.
It looked better in the brochure.
I don’t believe that is fake news.
Yes, actually, the cold is indeed limited to my crotch area!
The overflow room really isn't so bad.
i guess we should have listened when they said there was a special hell for those who pirated cable.
It makes a change from Seinfeld reruns.
The commercial break lasts an eternity.
Just an average meeting at your local cable company...
Turns out hell is produced by Michael Bay.
I thought the TV would be high definition down here.
Figures they'd have 24 hour news coverage in hell.
This isn't much of a recreation break.
dear caption judge(s) how are u today? i am well thank u for considering my caption today. today i went to wal mart, ate ravioli, bought reduced fat triscuit crackers, and played a video game. i hope ur day was as fun as mine today!
Lucky us! I hear all the real stuff is being channeled to a volcano in Hawaii.
Welcome to Hell, no HD
Hell? Yes! But no heat!
I'm sick of this surreality TV show.
I heard that if we have good behavior, he’d let one of us change the channel.
Hell of a way to save on heating.
Somehow I doubt there’s a ‘free gift’ at the end of this one.
I know that we are definitely in hell- no cable!
The millenials watch this on their phones.
The worst part is there is nothing but infomercial on!
Hi, I'm Sam Harris.
This is where " House of Cards" ended up...............
Have you seen the remote?
'Project Runway' sure is different down here.
I was the cartoon editor for The New Yorker. Get it?
I was hoping it would actually be hot enough for me.
Betcha don't regret missing out on the 'genuine experience' now!
The "lifestyle" has gone to hell since Satan joined.
He is getting heating credits- thankfully he doesn't think climate change is evil.
Well, it's not what it was cracked up to be. Can you think of anything we can do now?
I didn't know we got C-SPAN down here.
Damn - he makes it sound so tempting!
I always wanted to go to a nudist colony
Home movies again??!?
What were you expecting? Virtual reality?
It’s the resolution that crushes your soul.
Well...we won’t ever be cold again
I swear to god...if they tell us to buckle up...
We've had some budget cuts lately, but this should get the point across.
This isn't too bad, but I guess it is just orientation.
They're a bit nostalgic since they went microwave.
You'd think the Prince of Darkness could afford a better TV.
The pre-show is hell
Are you kidding me? Only one channel, and it's the Christmas Yule log?
This was the last check-off on my bucket list. How about you?
I still think the book was better !!
They always make us sit through the coming attractions
Fired up??
Low-def TV? This really is hell.
Can you believe this? Even my smallest crack house had cable.
This season of Hell’s Kitchen hits a little too close to home.
Why no sound? That's torture!
Hannity's on again.
He's a throw-back! I thought he'd have streaming and a flat-screen for sure.
You'd think they could afford an upgrade on the monitor.
It's the same compilation of Trump's speeches they show 24/7.
Its going to be torture not getting Netflix here
I would have at least bargained for a flat screen.
Well, at least it's not letterboxed...
We can carry on sinning here.
I always said watching reality TV was hellish.
Is the yule log all we get on TV here?
I'm very disappointed. Ditch the antenna and get cable tv.
It's really neat - they show it every Christmas all day.
I heard we get project runway down here
I never guessed a physical was part of the entrance exam.
I'm told that back in the seven hundred-twelfth season, something might have happened.
I love the trailers for the new shows.
No cable. EXACTLY what I expected.
This doesn't really work if we're all just going to pretend we came here ironically.
Woah, Trump did that?!
Hey, I think you're hot!
After the show, wanna get some Starbuck's blonde, naked?
It's a lot more environmentally friendly.
It's not in HD - this'll be worse than I thought.
Are you auditioning for the last episode too?
I hear he’s adding the Brimstone Channel next month.
Damn, the Fire Channel again?
As if hell isn't bad enough -- overflow hell?
I told you working here would be a virtual hell.
Reality TV — seems like it’s just as fakey here.
On the other hand they might send us back to the reality show
Pretty good reception down here.
I am so tired of his syndicated programs.
Which weapon accessory do you pick: the tail or the spear?
Old school intake video....nice
I was attending the nudists' museum tour and boom, here I am.
So here he'll be watching us?
Would you prefer virtual flames, virtual clothes, or virtual satan?
I told you it was a bad idea to illegally share your friend's netflix account!
Virtual Hell ain’t so bad.
Seen it.
Dare me to move the antenna and make it snow?
The Presidential State of the Union will begin momentarily.
I thought I was okay with the whole 'you're going to spend eternity in hell' thing, but I still have not come to grips with the rabbit ears.
If it's only on the small screen, that means that we're in purgatory.
I guess we're dead, and this is orientation?
Dante never mentioned that we have to pay for cable!
I didn't realize everyone would be nude.
It would be much more effective on a large screen TV.
I can't believe budget cuts have trickled all the way down to Hell.
Hell is no clicker.
Well, at least it's commercial free....
It's the naked truth versus virtual reality.
Standard def television—now that's torture.
He let’s us watch the NHL when New Jersey’s playing.
The limitations of this whole net neutrality repeal are quite hellish
Funny, that's the exact same view I had out my living room window in Leilani Estates, just before I arrived here...
That's all that's ever on...
Okay, you’re right, this is hell. 16” television, rabbit ears — just like my in-laws’ den.
I can understand no satellite, but why not cable?
They say the 7th circle is reality TV.
Can’t wait to just Netflix and burn.
This is just part of his welcome presentation for new members since the PowerPoint broke. He promised the presentation won’t take an eternity, but I’m not sure.
Wait till you try it on the VR headset
I wasn’t expecting Netflix but come on, this can’t be the only channel in town
I meant no disrespect - that’s what we used to call a TV when I was a boy
Sure they have plasma screens up there, but I'm here for some good old-fashioned sin.
I'm not too worried. He doesn't even have cable yet!
Those X rated movies have lost their lustre
The torment and wailing stops when 'Game of Thrones' is on.
Hawaii's a nice change of pace, don't you think?
Don't you just hate these 6 second commercials before the video.
I hope our new uniforms don't include a pair of shorts. I'm embarrrassed to show my legs.
It's worse than I thought...they don't have cable!
I hear they've got a mounted flat screen over in Flatterers and Seducers.
Say it with me: "we can't afford a timeshare, we just want the free trip."
“It appears there have been some cutbacks”.
Hell is an eternity spent watching the Yule Log on SDTV.
I can't believe that for all it cost us to get here they don't have flat screen tv.
It's so heavenly here. No commercials.
It's getting so crowded down here that Lucifer had to cut costs and cable was the first thing to go.
I thought Devil's games were in New Jersey.
The worst part is that they’re all reruns.
Heard we're going to be extras in the remake of The Naked and the Dead
No, the flames aren’t so bad; rather it’s the intermittent reruns of “Gilligan’s Island.”
just as I feared. My parents' television and the eternal yule log. great.
I thought Minow had it right with the "vast wasteland" thing, but this is worse that I thought.
Even worse, it's a rerun.
Heaven upgraded to flat screens 20 years ago.
Pain I can tolerate. But NOT without HD!
That's why it's so hot!
I'm so excited for Naked and Afraid's final season.
Could be worse, at least he's not making us watch political pundits debate on cable news.
Timeshares are hell to get rid of.
The season finale only seems like an eternity.
You create a distraction, and I’ll change the channel.
Its almost as stimulating as binge watching "Downton Abbey"
I wonder if they have "The Real Housewives"?
Millennials...
As seen on tv, just burning. So, nothing new...
With all the VIPs down here, you’d think they’d at least have cable.
Except for UHF TV, it isn't nearly as bad down here as I thought it was going to be.
No DVR? He IS evil.
I'm sorry your disappointed. Because of climate change we can only have real fires on special occasions.
After our orientation session would you like to join me for an espresso beverage that baristas find absolutely infuriating to make?
First one to find the remote wins.
If this is the trailer, I'd rather not stick around for the movie.
This isn't even as bad as an airline.
The worst part is it's not in HD.
'' I heard that Desi Arnaz Sr is making a cameo appearance in this episode of I love Lucifer. "
At least channel 666 doesn’t have commercials.
I see I'm not the only one who didn't pack a sweater.
You'd think they'd have cable here.
Is there going to be a test, on any of this, Lucifer?
Don't worry, it's just propaganda
Netflix and Grill?
Who farted?
They’ve got 24-hour news down here, too.
For me, 30 years down and forever to go.
I think it's the warm-up for the main event.
His home movies are getting a little old.
Thursday is Amazon Fire TV night.
He's got to know virtual hell just don't cut it.
I never thought of this as a benefit of fracking.
It's our way to fight global warming.
It greatly reduces carbon emissions - he hopes to be able to stream it in a millennia or two.
I'm Tom, the new guy. Believe it or not I actually wrote Bonfire of the VaniTV's
Two hundred thirteen channels, and this is the best one.
The Cool Medium my ass.
Just a few short years ago it was nothing but filmstrips!
Hopefully I can catch the game tonight.
Welcome to Reality Hell: The Series.
This may seem weird and beside the point, but I kinda get a kick knowing my home theater is better than Lucifer's.
It's not him telling you where to stuff this. It's me.
The brochure promised flames in hi-def.
Safe to say we misread the horny line in the advertisement.
It'll probably be better in high def.
I bet they have HD in heaven.
I binged this series last week.
After this scary video, we're more likely to buy the tanning spray.
It's a VHS - no streaming down here.
I heard heaven has flat screens.
Our ultimate destination being what it is, we should be thankful that it's not reruns of Dancing with the Stars.
Man: So even in hell, Satan has to turn the dial and adjust antennas for basic cable hell feed? Woman: At least it’s not Fox News.
Like I said. Other people.
Rabbit ears is one thing, but only getting the Yule Log program for eternity is a real bummer.
I kinda don't mind reruns of The Apprentice.
They won't change channels in doctor's offices either.
Cost-cutting maneuver. Next level, we all get sweaters.
This is so much better without all the ads.
I swear these Fox prime time audition lines get longer every season.
Rabbit Ears! This really is Hell
Now I get what those underfunded schoolteachers were mad about.
We're going to spend eternity craving authentic experiences.
Oh, boy. An eternity of re-runs. This really is hell.
I bet they don't get all these repeats in the other place.
The worst? These are my reading glasses.
It's not as messy, and we save on fuel.
I hear the cable bill was just getting too goddamned hellacious.
I hear some are calling this: Netflix and grill.
Now I know how he can afford to entice all these people here... He hasn't touched the place since 1983.
He is really into slow tv these days
Orientation became mandatory after the previous residents sued God because Hell was hotter than they expected.
The Apocalypse will be televised!
Not having cable is hell.
Here's hoping St. Peter has a sense of humor.
I miss the old reality TV when we thought it wasn't real.
That’s not FOX News. We must be in heaven.
The place is spiritual, nudists and warm all the time.
Just when it gets interesting they change it to sports
I always wondered if I'd run into an old flame
Sure it makes me nostalgic, just not in a good way...
Welcome to Hell; 500 channels and their all the "Yule Log".
This is the commercial break - the actual programming is infomercials.
This is the worst teaser I've seen.
I heard he saves the training video for sweeps week.
This was the only channel he ever watched, so he said the hell with cable.
You'd think he'd at least let us watch Fox News."
It's the movie trailer about the rest of your eternity.
Remember when I used to say nothing was worse than these emergency weather interruptions....
It could also just be a commercial for a hibachi grill.
Hades TV is bigger than Netflix.
I love how they’ve combined retro technology with a state-of-the-art trailer.
No spoilers!
Nice and warm !
Kardashians!
I see Flipper. What do you see?
I am more shocked that Satan doesn't have a flatscreen.
Well,at least it isn't The Big Bang Theory
A Weinstein trailer on rabbit ears -- man, are we screwed.
With rabbit ears you only get one local station
I really thought Deal With the Devil was just a reality TV show.
If it's auditioning for this reality show or an eternity of Trump's tweets, let's do this one.
He's a devil of a showoff AND we saw this episode last week.
I mainly watch it for the commercials.
I was a producer for the Kardashians, so I've kind of seen this one before.
Global warming is costing him so much that the Devil had to slash his fuel bill here.
At this point, I only really trust Flame News to tell it like it is.
I wondered what they did with the old glass tube TVs.
Yeah, no liquids allowed — not even jokes about water.
Talk about primal—they still use a tube T.V.
Cheaper than gas.
Where's my remote, Linda?
After the war with everyone, the Trump cabinet members, who did not make it out alive, watch the introductory "guide" to their new home.
I get the cutbacks on heating costs but come on - at least spring for a flat screen.
When did they start sending virgins here?
What the ..?
I hear in Heaven their 24/7 fire burning show has a Yule Log. Fancy.
Don't worry, at 6 he plays reruns of Friends
We've been stuck with the local channels ever since they cut the cord.
In heaven they're watching Britcoms.
Let's just change the channel.
I suffer just remembering my 65 inch high-res OLED smart TV.
I'm glad I waited. This year's schlong-soul trade has even more enhancements and size.
It's due to climate change.
This season of Satan's Island is the hottest yet." "Yeah. It's interactive
Sorry. We ran out of room in main furnace.
Great thing about Hell. Yule Log 24/7.
The only other channel is Milton Berle
Not watching flat screen is worse than hell.
Are we the hosts or the guests?
They went with the YouTube yule log after deciding the fires of hell were no longer sufficient punishment.
It's a CRT. That's hell for ya.
They call it Reality TV, but in this case the joke is on them.
Merry Christmas!
This is the "cooling off" period.
Spare the air days really put a damper on the fire and brimstone.
Yet another reality show,
Don't you sometimes wonder what genius decides what's shown on TV?
Now that's a warm reception.
“This is not as hot as I thought it would be”.
Is this all going to be reality TV?
It's not the heat or the frustration........it's the no cable.
I can't believe you had to leave the implants behind.
He’s trying to make hell more appealing by making it a Netflix series.
It’s the new Flame-grilled Buttery Jack Burger.
As visions of hell go this ain't so bad. Fire and brimstone on TV and everyone's naked.
It’s Season 4, Episode 7, but it feels like a retell of Season 1 with a new cast and more social critique and brimstone.
The low-quality picture is insufferable.
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?
At least we know who was behind Betamax.
It must be "Breaking News".
The real torture is the cliffhanger ending.
"Hi, we are here for the "Fire and Fury" we keep hearing about on Fox".
I'm feeling a draft. Do you think they can turn up the volume?
Next we are going to make you listen to Nickelback
The programming has improved. We used to have only reruns of the Golden Girls.
That's what passes for unscripted reality television down here.
Where's the heat?
I never thought I’d miss the Yule Log channel.
I hope they add a Yule log for Christmas.
Without real flames, the vibe is much more “purgatory” than “everlasting damnation.”
The reception is awful, but they said Comcast is too evil
Nothing gut Geico commercials
Amazing what gets a PG rating these days.
Yeah, its my second day of orientation. The trick is to really play it up. If he thinks you're not into it he'll bring you up front and make an example of you.
I hope this ends better than the last time share group.
Not having HD -- now that's real hell!
They were right. Endless reruns of "Gilligan's Island" IS pure hell.
With budget cuts looming, Satan decided to get creative.
These infomercials are really hell.
It gets worse - just wait till they turn on the smell-o-vision
I guess the punishment is an eternity of black-and-white TV with one channel and bad reception.
This better be one hell of a show.
This program makes me hot.
The new mining regulations mean there's very little fuel left for Hell.
Now he tells us!
I love the previews
Any chance we can change channels?
If you think this is good we should check out the live taping downstairs.
Heatonism
Okay, but I was really looking forward to seeing Brimstone.
So hell looks a lot like 1960's television.
Now if the emperor has really real clothes, I'm going to be annoyed beyond words.
I think we should stick with the Fire Channel. He says there is no cable down here and the only other choice is the Brimstone Channel.
Is this orientation really necessary?
We get the hand-me-downs. I hear we're getting a Samsung soon.
The worst part is, it's not even HDTV.
It’s because of budget cuts, but I’m okay with it.
You know, telecommuting just didn’t revolutionize the afterlife the way they said it would.
Rosemary's Baby " again !!! "This must be hell !
Just turn it off!
Does the party start after the safety film?!
So, this is Hell..no Wi-Fi
Sweet deal: limitless term, full membership and they say the hot yoga is really, really hot.
It's the only channel. This really is hell.
It's a new reality survival program called Naked and Afraid ... and Scorched.
I wish you hadn’t forced me into the cult. I knew they wouldn’t have streaming movies in the end.
The fire is always redder on the other side.
I could learn a thing or two from you humans.
It was much less hellish before his cord-cutting experiment.
The hi-def is nice, but it's the only channel we get.
so this is what hell looks like
Your new treat is technicolor
Can't blame him -- the heating bills were ungodly.
Their carbon profile will go even lower after they get the flat screen installed.
No one mentioned anything about no cable.
I hear it's the Devil's favorite show.
If you binge this show, they'll make you purge.
Sinclair Broadcasting just renewed this show for eternity. The flames are brought to us by the burning souls of Sebastian Gorka, Sean Hannity and that ex-President with the funny hair. Listen carefully, they’re screaming ‘What about Hillary?’
This is that old satan satellite. I paid extra for HBO heaven in my room.
Who knew that global warming started in 1962.
I bet he wishes he had a 50 inch flat screen.
It's good to know they're doing something about global warming.
"Survivor" is an option for the first ten contestants.
This is worse than I thought; no color, no HD
I think this TEDx talk has gone too far.
The fire and Brimstone was bad enough but now we have to watch Fox TV”.
I kinda knew this was coming. I was sure he'd make us watch reruns of 'The Apprentice' for eternity. But do we have to be naked?
Yes, the acting here is better, but I still say the ‘Yule Log’ writing was more lively and crisp.
I love reality television.
Wow. It's like an Amish fireplace and a nudist colony. It was better at the movies.
No channel surfing here.
What's Streaming?
Devilish, making us watch travelogues.
We should have upgraded to Pergatory.
These Hawaii life feeds sure make me appreciate Hell.
I like what I see.
Rabbit ears? No cable? That's not a good start.
Is this what the kids meant by Netflix and chill?
I’m cold.
I can’t wait to see the Yule Log on Christmas.
I guess in Hell we don’t have to give up all our earthly habits.
Is this the line for U2 tickets?
Can we change the channel.
Usually it’s a safety video.
Welcome to the Nielsen family.
You think they have a VCR where you push play and record at the same time too?

I wish they would update these welcome videos. They feel very 80s.
This truly is hell, the television isn't high def!
When I said watching the yule log on TV with my family was like Hell, I didn't know how right I'd be.
We used to have a flatscreen, but somebody stole it.
Those fireplace videos have a whole new meaning down here.
Would you believe I'm a devil-may-care sort of guy?
It's still better than American television
So, I guess that this is another benefit of the environmental regulations restricting open fires.
I think it's something about cutting down on fossil fuel. Did you get the message "Come As You Are"?
Satan just won that famous interview guy's soul and now he thinks he's king of the fireside chat with a black background, Christ, this is going to be a long eternity.
Silly, it is. But four hours of commercials? Pure Hell.
I don't watch television. I read books.
These summer reruns are so monotonous, I'm looking forward to Sweeps Week.

This is so much better than reading "The Inferno"
...or does life imitate art?
It's poor reception, but at least it's free.
This really is hell. All we have is analog TV.
If the TV has rabbit ears you can bet they don't have any premium channels.
We only get shows hosted by Ryan Seacrest.
Hell hath no fury like undergrads burned by a Plato cave reenactment gone awry.
This is hell - no cable, no satellite, only rabbit ears!
Well we paid the ultimate price for this pay per view. At least there’s no commercials.
Yeah, there are only four channels, but next week we're getting UHF!
A.I. PURGATORY—-S.R.O.
Reduces our carbon footprint.
I am not surprised that is the channel with the best reception around here ...
This is not exactly Surround Sound, is it?
Hell is other people's TV.
My favorite show, "Brimstone," is on next.
this is worse than I thought. TV with no remote control, and only one channel.
It's not the cooking channel.
I haven't been this embarrassed and terrified since the election of Donald Trump.
He still hasn't subscribed to Netflix, so this is the only way to binge watch the end of humanity.
I've found it's the only way to make them realize how much agony they're in.
Did you know 'netflix & chill' was a sin?
This orientation sure is thorough. Who knew there were so many varieties of brimstone?
I didn't think it could get hotter than Game of Thrones.

Well I would have thought the devil wouldn’t need to cut corners?
I’m hoping for This Is Us but something tells me it’s Season 3 of Naked and Afraid.
Reality TV from hell.
Well, at least it won't be hard to tell who's hot and who't not . . .
Watch this while the writers come up with an ending.
Can someone PLEASE pass the remote?
One would think Satan could afford a modern tv without rabbit ears.
Watching a loop of a fire on a black and white TV. My personal television of hell.
It's the second hand suffering channel.
Aren't we pushing the boundaries of virtual reality?
You'd think someone with his clout would have something better than an old TV with a rabbit-ears antenna.
Sure, he’s no angel. But he makes fantastic Supreme Court nominations.
You got to give the United Hell Workers Union credit as conditions have really improved lately.
The commercial breaks are more demoralizing than the searing heat
Welcome to yet another episode of "Naked and Afried"!
After this comes one year of "My Mother the Car" reruns.
The living room's nice, but you should see the kitchen.
A TV with Rabbit Ears?! This is far worse than anything I could possibly imagine.
He’s reducing his carbon footprint.
Hell has gone digital. It saves on gas...
Obviously, there are 10 rings of Hell.
"All it shows are the 'My Pillow' commercials.
Primetime television has really become a shit show; nothin' but dumpster fire.
It'd be more painful with a laugh track!
I’m just glad that it’s not Fox News ...
We now return you to your scheduled program Flame of our Lives.
Well, this beats the 24-hour news cycle!
This is no yule log,
At least it's emission-free.
I didn’t realize eternal damnation meant no Netflix. I am officially freaking out!
Did you also watch a lot of reality TV?
this group's sin was intolerance- we're sentenced to watch a continuous loop infomercial about frying pans for eternity
Time shares have never been hotter.
We just added Hell’s Kitchen, Chicago Fire and Six Feet Under to our lineup, folks.
I'm not feelin' the bern.
Join or die. Or also die even if you join.
It looks like we got out just in time
It's pay-per-view.
At least it’s not another Hell’s Kitchen repeat...
In the next level of hell, they broadcast Fox News.
I hear we’re getting cable next week. And you thought they couldn’t punish us any more!
The digital age really diminishes experiences if you ask me.
I'm sick of watching C-SPAN.
I thought he was talking about the Amazon thing.
Bearing your soul is the next step.
This is worse than I imagined. No flat screen TVs.
I'm surprised, because the cable service here is better than you'd ever expect but it just shows the weather channel
I don't get it, half the Industry is here yet we still only have one channel. And like a Yule log gone wrong.
He's trying to tell us that this is not reality a TV.
Next on W.H.E.L., Hell and Damnation, after this!
They only use analog here, and the screen isn't even HD
The definition is barely better than torture!
Ugh, a black and white TV!
At least it's not Big Brother...that would be hell.
At least it's not "Cartoon Network."
Down here they call this the Home Shopping Network.
They haven't been able to keep up with the influx. We're relegated to watching the Closed Circuit TV feed.
I don’t understand why we let the arsonists vote anymore.
Is this a "reality" show?
Having this Orientation was one hell of an idea!
No cable! This truly is Hell.
It's the poor reception that gets to you after awhile.
I think it’s a rerun but it’s kind of hard to tell.
I'll bet the TV in heaven is showing angels.
I had wondered where that Betamax tape had gone.
Yeah, it's part of the Devil's campaign to head the EPA. Cable, color and a big screen would have helped.
The other guy's pitch was better.
Every show is in standard definition.
When they said 'national geographic', this was not what I expected.
At least it's better than the TVs at the EPA.
I think i'll stick with my time share at Cap d'Agde.
They call it the cruel log down here. If they really wanted to make it torture, they'd add the Christmas music.
Our clothes.
We must be in hell. Where's the Samsung 75" Smart 4K UHD TV?
And the good news is....
It's in standard definition... this really is hell.
No! Not an eternity of CNN Breaking News.
And if you complain it automatically changes to CNN.
This might actually be better than cable.
Advances in technology are only going to make this worse.
Rabbit ears? I thought for sure this place would have cable.
I'm all for company culture --- but this year's keynote speech seems a little over the top.
They have the same cheapskate local broadcast crap in heaven but with that boring Gospel stuff.
The only other channel only shows Law and Order reruns
Do you think we’ll ever get our phones back?
Over-the-air TV only? This really is Hell!
Dammed if we do, dammed if we don't?
...ever since Satan went eco-friendly
Well this is embarrassing!
Trump insists there is no perversion. This is simply the best means of grabbing staffers by their privates to prevent leaking.
Rabbit Ears! This really is Hell

I can't help thinking something was lost when we went digital.
Welcome to Hell-e-vision
Well it’s a lot colder in Heaven.
Reruns of “The Blob”, we are in hell.
In my previous life I never had any patience for orientation programs.
It's just the Yule Log, but we're the next log.
When they let in latecomers, let's stay out here.
Nice introductory video, but still burning fossil-fuel!
It seems admissions wasn't too keen on the minority experience.
So I guess the midterms were more of a red wave then?
I didn't realize carbon emissions smelled so much like fire and brimstone.
Yep, we have to binge watch 'Hell's Kitchen.'
Everything shrinks when it's cold.
...I guess the grass isn't ALWAYS greener on the other side.
I always found watching TV to be torturous, but I must admit, these flames are mesmerizing!
Back in my day, "The Voice" was a singer and listening to him was not a sin.
What time does brimstone come on again?
They got me for bragging I didn't own a TV set. How about you?
I wondered what happened to that Sequester thing.
It's not too late to repent
I'm glad we didn't pack any winter clothes.
It’s all the spoilers for all the shows you should have watched when you had the chance.

I used to watch this every year after A Christmas Carol.
Do you smell hot dogs?
I thought we are going to green earth, this appears to be hell.
OK! OK ! Listen up...This is season 5! The complete series is available only on VHS, see your torturer for the key to AV room. And by the… Spoiler alert!... There is no spoiler alert, what you see is all there is. Welcome to Hell!
They're having some technical difficulty. It will take some time but we've got plenty.
This place is a virtual hell!
This is worse than I thought -- a B&W television.
I bet that trident makes one hell of a channel changer.
At least we won't have to pay for cable.

Next time read the fine print before you sign the cable contract.
What did you expect once Bezosabub took control?
Is this Childish Gambino?
I'll be damned if it's not the golden age of TV here, too.
The Devil made me do it!
It must be their version of a Yule Log
i cant bare to watch the devil
I knew I’d end up at Walmart...
I should have eaten Wheaties!
I could watch the HellNews Channel all day long.
Enough with the commercials!
What a boob I was to not believe he was such a prick.
This is his version of the Christmas Log on TV for eternity. At least its better than the cable sign-up commercials that it replaced.
It's REALLY nice on Christmas Eve.
If this is Hell,I'm in Heaven!
I guess this is what they call virtual reality
Boring...
Budget cuts...at least it's not a big screen!
What's worse is there's no remote.
Could you please change the channel?
I heard that this is the final episode in this series.
Now I know what Hell is. No flat screen tv.
On last week's episode of "Naked and Afraid" someone was bitten in the ass by an alligator.
[[This image is fairly offensive for some reason. You should pick another]]
ugh.. can we fast forward it? I hate these damned commercials.
I hear we get free HBO

So they added a tenth circle for stars of reality TV.
It’s not even HD.
I'm not too crazy about the previews.
"I liked the Christmas Yule Log better".
Frankly, I like it. AND everyone here says "Merry Christmas."
At least they have Saint Elmo’s in syndication
This 10th Circle isn't so bad.
It's not much better in higher resolution.
Did you sign up for the potluck?
Hey, Steph, I finally get that McLuhan joke!!!
The Yule log added something.
The Price is Right is on next.
I bet Premium Cable would give us the true experience of fire and brimstone!
It's either Hawaii or Hell
I think those rabbits need some tin foil.
Now that's what I call a boob tube
let’s get off on the next floor
By doubling energy consumption they hope to meet climate warming goals over the next decade.
This is the discount package.
I bet he doesn't even get HBO.
Even Hell itself has to modernize.
Are we paying extra for a Hell All Access subscription or is it part of the basic cable package?
Here it’s only re-runs...no commercials.
This has nothing on the Yule Log.
It’s not even HD, this really IS hell.
Brown, James Brown!!!
Looks like we beat the rush.
Look, I'm just going to put it out there; do you ever feel like our role play has gotten out of hand?
Every little bit counts, in the fight against global warming.
Watching the boob tube for eternity really is hell.
Could you sign this consent form acknowledging that I share details about your personal life with our co-workers around the water cooler?
I see reruns of ‘The Jerry Springer Show’. What do you see?
At least it's not basic cable.

Does SPF 50 protect you from high heat?
I always said that reality TV was a fresh hell.
I was pretty sure there wouldn't be wifi, but I thought there would at least be satellite TV.
This is the most boring onboarding video I've ever seen.
I'm not sure - it could season 666.
Nice to see that things are the same back home.
You know Mr. Belvedere wasn't that bad a show.
I don't care, I'm a radio-guy, myself.
Not bad.
Lose cable all ye who enter here.
I thought at least we'd get cable....
Is that the smell of sulphur did somebody just trump?
I guess all hell broke loose.
He makes us watch reruns of a show he used to be the star of...I think it's called The Apprentice
I'm not saying I was a saint, but Standard-Definition? Really?
Don't worry, those flames are obviously fake news. I'm mean even the TV and that guy's costume are fake. They can't do anything right. Sad.
Great reception!
We're in the white collar section.
I lied about never watching TV. Why are you here?
What, a flat screen doesn't get hot enough?
This is easily my favorite rerun.
Wait 'til Flava Flav comes on.
One channel over-the-air? Now that really is Hell!
And to think that watching FOX NEWS cold land us here.
A pledge break would be hell right now.
I'm sure it would look hotter in 4K...
So glad you're relieved. Bad news is, you're all CGI, and your actual bodies are downstairs in the actual furnace. Have a great eternity.
This is Milleanials Clothes Horse idea of Hell.
That Jon Snow guy was full of it!
I dunno, it feels like we’re cheating hell somehow.
It’s colder than I thought...
So this is what it is like to stand naked before God but I didn’t know Satan would be here,too.
Gas bill last month was hell.
You have to admire his creativity.
Yes, we’ve lost a certain romance, but our eternal fire bill has plummeted and we’re on track to phase out brimstone entirely.
It's a Sinatron. Nice picture quality.
The reception in hell is not that bad after all. Even Satan came to greet us.
If they’re going to bore us to death, I wish they’d just show commercials.
There really is a hell
Isn't it impressive how well M*A*S*H holds up?
I think it's a rerun.
It’s called The Yule Log.
They say weather forecasters love it down here!
He’s become much more aware of under global warming.
I know... Low-def. It's torture.
How disappointing. No cable.
I don't know about anyone else, but this flick is doing zero towards getting me in the mood. Is there a volunteer willing to maybe climb up there and vigorously manipulate the rabbit ears?
We used to have rabbit ears on our family television.
Even in Purgatory they have a flat-screen TV.
Being forced to watch non HD for an eternity truly is a living hell.
He keeps promising HD in the hereafter.
Somebody has stolen his remote.
This is their attempt to reduce dependence on fossil fuel.
Im a bit disappointed. I thought it would be warmer down here.
You know, these Housewives reality shows really help me feel better about my situation.
It looks better on cable.
I heard there were budget cuts.
Diners, drive-ins, and death am I right?
Hell hath no fury like multiple lovers scorned
Gee, that trade war really cut deep.
Having a special place reserved for all of us down here is not so bad, but having to watch CNN for eternity really sucks!
It seems we have to watch a commercial bofore we go down.
Kind of chilly in here.
Gas was turned off but we still got electricity, so he wants us to at least see the flames.
I preferred it when it was just the vast wasteland.
Who knew C-SPAN could be so exciting?
Only this channel? Worst Hell ever!
Netflix.
Ever since the writers' strike, it's just been hell.
I’d rather take a bath.
And we thought those time share guys were pushy.
Thank god for the great indoors.
It's good for the environment but leaves me cold.
Can you change the channel?
It’s fake news.
When we got our first HDTV, I said to my wife, "I feel like I've died and gone to heaven."
And here is our top-of-the-line 4K Retina display. Really brings the flames to life.
Are you here for the Chef or Waiting position?
This is hell alright, no satellite TV no cable
The Travel Channel on cable as better visuals.
He believes screen time is bad for us.
He cracked the algorithmic code! Yule log '96 was the height of human misery!
I don't know what scares me more, the idea of burning in hell or the fact that the televisions in hell are 30 years behind the times.
The Weather Channel is like Fox News around here.
It’s either this or the marshmallow channel.
Ah, the good old day before CGI and George Lucas...
Who knew Hell was going to be so boring?
In Hell, all we get is reality TV
Reminds me of standing in line at Nathan's
You think it's bad without clothes? At least you're not in the president's cabinet. It's a bloodbath up there.
'Netflix and chill means something different down here'
Commercials are still the best thing on TV.
I'm just here for the people watching.
Didn't I tell you hell is life without cable?
I like it warm but hell, this is crazy.
Low definition TV? This must be hell.
A VIDEO OF FIRE
I just knew it. Hell would have an orientation.
I never thought I'd miss the Kardashians.
Not only is "Home Fires Burning" the only channel down here, but it is Pay-Per-View!
I only came because I wanted to be in the scene with Mia Farrow.
‘The Apprentice,’ again?
I'm confused. I distinctly remember the Prophet telling you guys that plural marriage is the true path to Heaven.
It's an orientation film for the new folks: "Hot Enough for Ya?"
I heard the missus is menopausal.
I didn't like the Yule log video either.
It's either this or put a sweater on.
And now, coming to you from your new activities director...
You had me at barbecue.
Who ever thought that Critics would wind up in their very own circle of Hell?
I’d rather be burned alive than spend eternity watching Slow TV.
I miss seeing snow when there is nothing reception.
See this is what happens when
It's the orientation film, starring Redrum and Rellik.
I'm not saying the show isn't problematic, but I feel like that's kind of the point.
Upstairs has been taking a lot of heat lately.
You'd think he could at least have a 70-inch flat screen!
These State of the Unions are getting worse every year
we will be stuck with the local station
Even in life, I said this was hell.
Trust me, this is a step up from Genghis Khan's doo-wop group
Yeah it makes his job easy, but I go back and forth on whether the Christmas music is torture or not.
Who in hell does he think he's fooling?
The micro is that life imitates art. The macro is that we're going to be standing here forever because this is a New Yorker cartoon.
I say we hide behind God's bushes back there, and get away from these devil worshiping creeps.
What the hell; let’s go for it!
I think we should all just un-plug, and get back to nature!
We only get four channels, but next week I hear we're getting UHF!
Flames in hell? Groundbreaking. This marketing is so 2008.
During May Sweeps, they put the log on.
I hear they don't have cable in heaven.
Don't worry. I have some hope back in my room.
Riding the highway on the way here was way more fun.
We used to just have a radio sound recording - this is way better!
It's much better on the big screen - you know, with surround-a-burn.
The environmentalists outlawed Brimstone. But the Yule fire is a nice touch.
All this time on empty podiums shows how complicit the media is.
Do you think that’s why his trident is so big?
I don't know what's worse - Actual fire or seeing it naked on an old CRT tv.
Eternal Reality TV.
These previews are always way too long.
These infomercials are hellish.
Where’s the brimstone?
See? Right there. We DO have black friends!
Not quite the same as having a fire place - still, for the holidays it's a nice touch.
Hope it burns up the ratings. I didn't sign on to "Naked and in Hell" for nothing.
He likes to watch a scary movies on halloween.
When was it that god stopped showing up for these events...?
I hear it corrupts the youth
Do we really need inspirational instruction videos?
Crowdsourcing, my ass. He’ll never let us get an HDTV.
I know I’m dreaming. It’s all so...traditional.
This health insurance plan is way better than my old PPO!
We're ready...come hell or high water
I don't think we need an orientation video.
Don't you think this dating service is just too strict?
It's Much More Interesting Than Air Conditioning !
I'd swear in a stack of bibles, he sounds and looks exactly like my Drill Sargent!
I think it's a cow that badly needs to be milked.
So, when's he going to change the channel?
Welcome to Hell everybody. First, we'll watch this quick 15-20 minute instructional video, then we can begin the guided tour
Ok everybody. First of all, we so appreciate your patronage. This is the sort of thing you can all expect when we get inside.
I guess you missed the spoiler alert.
I guess they are saving energy everywhere
It gets worse. At eight he changes the channel to reruns of Gilligan's Island.
at least it's not HD! submitted by Wes age 8 OR
I didn't bring my sun tan lotion.
"Reality TV" is so twentieth century.
It's just another rerun
You say it’s “Naked and afraid” ...I thought it was “Survivor “..
I wonder what he'll do to me if I start singing 'Ain't it Hot Hot Hot'?
This is almost as bad as watching ‘The Holiday Log.
I hear in heaven they have HiDef.
Honestly, this is worse than I expected.
He takes the idea of picturing the audience naked very literally.
Look, we ran over our fire budget. To make up for it, watch this burning yule log video from last Christmas. You're welcome.
Now who's the dummy?
My guess is he's streaming this news from Hawaii via the FireTV Stick.
I’ve heard that before Global Warming, this place used to have a better entertainment program.
Must be the Holidays...all we get is the yule log channel
I don't think we're in purgatory anymore.
That's the problem with the whole idea of eternal torment. At some point, even the tormentors get so bored they just stop trying.
I hear that heaven has cable.
I thought there would be plasma televisions.
Well, I guess the kids were right- this IS better than going outside.
OK Everybody, were moving to Hawaii
I hear we’re getting a flat screen next week.
The brimstone's on Betamax.
So much for becoming a 'Fed'!
I heard that hell froze over but I didn't believe it until now.
Take it from me - do NOT tell him how much it reminds you of the fireplace channel you'd watch on Christmas morning...
I hear that the poor bastards in the Sixth Circle are forever looking for the remote.
The way they're conserving energy down here, a snowball might actually stand a chance in hell.
They have hi-def flat screens upstairs, but you have to wear those horrid gowns.
Sheesh! I knew damned for eternity would be no fun but....we don't even get cable??
Am I too late foe the Spencer Tunick shoot?
Yeah it’s hot down here, but there’s good tv, pretty girls and i’ll never have to deal with shrinkage.”
If you ask me, the whole concept is retro eek.
Nice reception...lousy graphics...
Why is it always the guy with the biggest pitchfork who calls the shots?
You know the tempurature, the nudity it’s all fine, but no HD? Starting to seem like Hell
He raised hell when I called them "burny ears."
I've applied to be the Devil's Nudist Advocate.
Since we are incorporeal, anyway, I guess virtual flames are no big deal
That's it. There's no remote.
Hell is only having the Fireplace Channel on tv all day.
In season 3,576, we find out who the killer is.
I think this the course on smoke detector safety.
This is so meta.
Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do still like the yule log channel!
Gas prices went up again.
I'm all for fire safety but I still don't get when I'm supposed to scream in pain or stop, drop and roll.....
This reminds me of a great scene from the Wire. Did you see the Wire?
The real torture is the long commercial breaks
Rabbit Ears and a CRT! What could be worse?
Things have gotten so bad they can't even afford cable.
I know that we're here for eternity, but he does realize that somewhere out there is the 21st century, right?
What’s going on again?
I really thought Sadaam would've had a bigger dick
Most casting calls for extras don’t include this much fair warning.
First Trump, then another Ford. I knew it was a bad idea.
Even with budget cuts, you'd think they could get cable here of all places.
With oil at $70 a barrel, they couldn't afford real hellfire.
For being trapped for all eternity, you would think they would at least get High-Def.
This is the All-American First Class program: Guns, Drugs, Nakedness.....and cable.
first things first, shelter and water.
It's awfully popular for a show that doesn't do much in the way of character development...
Nothing works right in hell. Even the inferno is on the blink.
They closed down the coal mines to protect the environment.
Will sunscreen help?
The great thing about cable is the never-ending supply of election coverage.
It's only fire and brimstone repeats.
The good news is that we all are to be given a complete understanding of all truth and beauty. The bad news is that television will soon begin broadcasting Fox News for the rest of eternity. If they left me my hat, it'd be off to him.
Trump voters finally free to sexually harass.
I hear it's worse than it looks.
Satan's a late adopter. The brimstone's wax paper.
Do you think I can keep the glasses?
Seriously...that's his job? To tell us to turn so we don't burn?
Unless we get some clothes, that fire looks warm to me!
Another damn screen!
The good part is coming up soon!
Black and white TV? If that's all we get, we really are in Hell.
I thought it would be worse down here.
So much for getting the local channels in HD...

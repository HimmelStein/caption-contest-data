I think I'm losing interest in email.
You're kidding--the Rio Grande??

Yes, I can see the salmon is locally sourced, but is it fair trade?
Hmmm...a new item:  Climate Casserole.

Yes sir, the salmon’s caught fresh.
I really can’t bear the service here.
How was I to know the woods were that far?

No excuses, just the bare facts, where's the salmon I orderd ?
did you catch it and eat it?
I’ll have the glacial steak from your neighborhood.
So, you're saying the Salmon is not available?
OK, they are fresh, but how do I know they are not farm-raised?
Your lack of ice is why I didn't order a martini, so I feel your pain.
Decisions, decisions ... please bear with me
It's been done.
You had a bear of a day.I get it.
I asked if there was a wet bar.
The salmon for you then, dear?

So I guess this means the salmon is out ?
Yeah, it’s fresh-caught but did you use a hook?
I’m sorry sir there is no salmon in the river
I waited past 400 parts per million and then I ordered without you.
What do you mean ''We're out of ice"?
I appreciate that  thanks to your efforts, the salmon will be very fresh, but can you assure me there won't be any tooth or claw marks on it.
I take it you've closed the patio.
Actually, can I just get the chicken tenders instead?
Well, did you finally get the Salmon?
Are you absolutely certain that the fish is fresh?
I'll have the fresh caught salmon then
I'll have the seal?
Do you have any other wet beer on tap?
Out of Salmon, how about scallops.
If I had a dollar for every waiter who said he was 'in the juice'...
Geez, you bearly made it on time! Are you on menopaws!?
I'm glad you bathed before having me for dinner
Look, I only finance global warming.
Fresh caught salmon -- that looks interesting.
Well then, in lieu of the fresh caught salmon I'd like the trout
I don't care how hot it is there this is how I prefer to be served.
Well then, maybe instead of the salmon, I'll have the tuna.
I said medium rare, not rare.
‘I assume the salmon is not farm raised?’
Well, if you're out of the salmon, then how about the prime rib?
So the trout wasn't available?
Christ!   A bear!   A wet bear!  Don't they have towels around here?

Just act natural...
I’ll have the Eskimo pie, please.
Scratch that; I'll have the ribeye
I've heard the portions here are scarce too.
Sorry to bother you, but I gotta try this Alaskan wild salmon!
“Yes, but how do I know the salmon is in fact stream-to-table?”
I told you we were leaving at 7. Maybe next time you'll be ready.
Did I just get catfished?
I hope you're reporting your tips.
So....since the Pacific salmon is off the menu now, I'll have the wild bee honey comb with assorted berries.
Hi Nick- I'll have the usual- but make it a double martini. This bear market has me seeing things.
You say you caught the salmon yourself?
Well if the fresh caught salmon if no longer on the menu, just a couple Cornish game hens will do...
Do you work here?
On second thought, I'll pass on the salmon.
The seal is very fresh
When I said I wanted a "Wet Bear," I meant the cocktail.

I didn't want the catch of the day anyway.
So as soon as its cold and rainy you give up on the bare all for bears march?
So the chili is pretty hot then?
I bet it’s not raining in YOUR restroom!
No, I asked for the ice in my polar bear blended.
Dry yourself off and they’ll give you a table.
Do you have any iceberg lettuce?
Obviously the salmon is very fresh tonight, but I'm craving a little desert. Think you could gather up some berries?
Get out of here! Grizzly bears aren't allowed in restaurants!
OK, you made your point about global warming...but there's really no ice water left?
Will the wild game sampler give me meat sweats?
Try and keep it together,  you're claws ahead of the AI waiter I had last week
What time do you get off?

I'll have the salmon tartare, but it must be very fresh
It says here you can simply order the salmon.
Do you think you could at least manage to get me a few berries?

I can assure you, the catch of the day is extremely fresh.
How could you be out of iceberg lettuce?
Yeah, yeah. 'How dare you?' I've heard it before.
So you're the catch of the day?
Glad you took a bath, but where are your shirt and shoes?
This restaurant seems unbearable...
Bare with me, it's hard to choose...
The grilled salmon looks good.
Why don't you pull up a chair and join me. This may be our last meal, so we might as well enjoy it.
Care to talk about global warming?
Brave 2: They're in New York?
Last time, the salmon could have been fresher.
Would you like to try my rose'? It's a bit dry.
Can I see your manager please ?
You're being a real bear lately. Are you having a bad week?
Since you just caught the salmon, I don't need to hear the specials.
My English not so good..I asked about the lunch fare not a wet bear.
I suppose this is the sort of vision that a climate scientist, such as I, should expect to see after ordering the absinthe.
Well if the salmon isn't available I guess I'll have the halibut.
No, I don't want you to catch me something else from the stream, that where the fish with the hair on it came from!
Exactly how fresh is your locally-sourced salmon?
Now is it barely raining or just grizzling outside?
Senator, you gotta vote impeach. . . Pretty please?
I’ll try the fish out of water.
What kind of French restaurant runs out of thyme
Climate change is no excuse.
Had I known you were out of fish I would have ordered a red wine.
No, I would not like you to join me. Your story could make my story look downright happy.

Sorry sir we are completely out of freshly caught fish
How about if we share the salmon fillet?
Yes, the wild caught salmon.
I'm told your specialty is the baked Alaska.
I’m not happy about this either, my friend, but once you knock back that Beaujolais aperitif, I think you’ll really get into the chef’s hazelnut panko-crusted seal filet on a bed of light cream sauce with just a tease of habanero.
But how can you be sure the salmon is fresh?
I think I'll go with the steak.
My apologizes but salmon will not be served this evening.

I think you are supposed to dry your hands, too.
I know.  Sometimes I have to get my own dinner, too.

So there really were no exceptions to the "no smoking" rule.
Do you have baked Alaska?
OK, OK, enough already.
I guess vichyssoise is off the menu?
I asked about your salmon chiller, not salmon killer.
Is an Impossible Burger going to help out this situation?

You said you were coming to the climate change protest.... you posted it on facebook. I told you this would really help me out....
Where's my salmon?

'How's the fish?'
Did I say trout? I meant fresh salmon and try not to leave claw marks this time, thanks.
I knew they are not cooking cows!!

But you just had the salmon mousse for your appetizer!
You talked me out of the bear chop. I just have a hamburger.
I meant the Dripping Grizzly I.P.A.  !
I’ll have the salmon freshly caught.
I assume there is no iceberg lettuce today?
What do mean, you're out of salmon?
Well, I guess the farm raised will have to suffice.
Bear with me, the waiter will be back with your ice soon.
I get your frustration with climate change, but the seafood we get here is fabulous.
You can't order me out of an early hibernation just like that!
Thanks for not shaking my martini
Yes, salmon would be fine.
How can you drink at a time like this?
Waiter! There's some soup on my bear!
How Can I  Serve You Sir?
Once again, you swear the salmon been freshly caught!
What? No snow crab with snow peas and eiswein? 
What about sorbet?
I'll have the wild Alaskan Polar Bear from Denial-i.
I assume that the salmon is fresh?
I'll have a snow cone.  Please don't lick it.
So - that's my choice?  A 'wet bear' or a 'dry martini'?
Wipe your feet before you come in.
Ah yes.  The fresh-caught salmon...fine
You've run out of Baked Alaska?
You'd never know it, but I used to be an ice statue !
On second thought, I’ll have the salmon.
Is it true that you have the freshest fish in town?

She's not coming.
It most certainly was NOT me who ordered the boiled bear.
That is all very well, but if the salmon is, in fact, not freshly caught, I will not be paying.
You barely made it.......
My wife's pussy?! Ha! That's pretty good, man, I figured you'd been swimming in a lake or stream or whatever. Now, tell you what: I'm in town on business, OK? If you can direct me a tiddy bar and a bag of blow, I'd be willing to tip as much as 20%.

What! No fresh salmon?
I’ve changed my mind. Instead of polar bear, I’d like to try the endangered walrus.
I’m not sure the wild-caught salmon will pair well with this wine.
So you're the brown dripping? Then I'll have the foie gras instead.

What do you call a grizzly bear who gets caught in the rain? 
A drizzly bear.

Grilled Mako Shark with Mango Salsa.

I'll have the tuna steak, by the way...How are y'all getting along?
Bear with me for a minute while I look at the menu.
Aren’t we both getting a little tired of  having to replace“Seal with a kiss” with “Hurricane gumbo?”
Yes, please, I'll start with the seal tartare portion.
So, is “Bear Delice”the only Sous Vide that you offer?
So, we see a Polar Bear, guessing just  had to flee from the Arctic, where the waters are getting warmer because of Global Warming, and the ice floes are disappearing, waiting tables in Manhattan.
What  is there anything funny about this?
I've changed my mind. I'd like the venison, not the salmon.

I hear the wild caught Salmon is good, agree?

Was the salmon wild-caught with your bear hands?
Shall I order you the salmon to go?
I'll do the T-bone, though I'm sure the beetles and grubs are excellent.

No luck with the hunt, eh? O.K., I'll just have the bag of garbage.
And the harp seal for you?
I see you no longer offer the salmon. I guess if they were still running, you wouldn't be trying to eke out a living doing this.
I see the Baked Alaska is local and in season.
Better be careful. It's OK to eat red meat again.
I nearly drowned in what used to be a polar ice cap!!!
Sorry I’m late. Global warming slows me down.
Well, I see you're not on the menu. But a bath is good any time.

I'll have the three cubs on ice.
I'll have the Sea Bass then.

Oh...and I'd like that fresh waterfall trout prepared with the killer bee honey marinade
No, No, No, I told the waiter the Pears were soggy
I came here specifically for the salmon and now you tell me it is not available?  And no, I don't want a huckleberry salad instead.
Paddington that you?
I’d like the wild fish for the second and third courses as well.
I’ll start with the salmon sashimi .
Is it a bear market?
We are all out of baked Alaska.
Global warming has got me waiting on tables, at least this place could have air conditioning.
My bad. I meant the fresh Alaskan King CRAB, not the salmon.
And you're certain the Alaskan Sockeye is fresh?
Is that why she's late?
Well, I was going to order the live Maine lobster...
Is the baby fur seal fresh?
Since you're not able to offer the duck, I'll have the roast chicken.
I’m very sorry but I only reserved a table for one.
How do I know it’s not farmed salmon?
I suppose ice is out of the question.
I know I told you to take a shower before you came, but...
I'm going out on a limb here, but something tells me you must be the new seafood expert I've been hearing so much about.
I told you this place wasn't Bring Your Own Trout.
I'm convinced the salmon is fresh caught.
Okay, I'll have the fresh Artic Char.
Well, congrats Mr. "Dwindling Habitat" - you're so starved you're off the menu...Maybe the baby seal?
I'll have the chicken!

no excuses, go back and get me my fresh Salmon !
I'll have the Antarctic fresh catch.
‘“I’ll have the trout, but can you debone it for me please?”
You're late - no bear hug for you.
No, I don't see fresh seal on the menu...but it will probably become available as climate change warms more.
I'm drowning and no one seems to care.
I wouldn’t get the salmon if I were you.
I'd like to try something from your High Arctic entrees"
I guess the salmon is unavailable tonight.
Oh, I understand what you're saying; but, you see, I don't really believe in climate change.
Good Luck!  The penguins here are in season.
I told you the chef would be offended if you asked for more food.
Yes, the trout is fresh.
What's the chance of you running back out and grabbing me some fish?
So it's not fresh-caught...
Really? 'There's no salmon'?
Oh good, the rug's back from the cleaners.
Your locally sourced salmon seems popular - I'll have that.
Wow! You mean there’s no long wait for Baked Alaska??
What do you mean there’s no iceberg salad?
You took my umbrella!
Ok. So it's a pass on the iceberg lettuce.
I guess fresh frozen will have to do.
I know you SAY the salmon is fresh,but how fresh is it really?
Is that a promise?  You're sure the salmon's fresh!
I'm not getting venison for you, its pouring outside!
No, no, no. I ordered fresh SALMON
I hear your wild salmon crudo is to die for!
I will go with today's fresh salmon special.
I'll have the wet salmon, since they run so close.
No problem. If you're out of salmon I'll just have the Pasta Alfredo.
Can you honestly confirm that the sea trout is oraganic?
I appreciate your effort, but the seal blubber entree still doesn't sound appetizing.
So how baked is the Alaska, really?
Ohh Kayyy. If you're " out of" the fresh caught river salmon, just bring me BLT!
I don't care about climate change!! Just get me the Arctic Char!!
I'll have a cold bear.
Fine, the Arctic's out of ice, but you can't have it from my drink.
On second thought, forget the wild-caught salmon. I'll have free-range chicken.
'I said "rare".'
I specifically said ‘no ice.’
I’m sorry we won’t be serving the fresh salmon tonight.
So how can you guarantee that the salmon is fresh?
Oh go away! I ordered the dry beartini!
You know, I'm concerned about climate change too.
Please cancel the two iceberg pies.
A rainy day at the stock exchange, I assume?
You’re bearly dry
When I asked for the fish to be caught fresh,this is not what I had in mind.
May I recommend the Moose au Chocolate.
Forgot to ask one thing—is the Chinook salmon line-caught?
Yes, so you couldn't catch a salmon again; well, I guess I'll have to have the Oyster Rockefeller then.
I asked for a bear claw and a white claw.
I told you that wine wasn't dry.
Death is not the end.
Chill, Your problem is.... You can't go with the floe......
The wine and fries are mine.
I gotta say the service here is not what it used to be
So... salmon is off the menu tonight?
Let me guess, extra ice for your drink?
I was hoping for wild-caught salmon, not waiter.
All out of salmon? Ok, I'll have the tuna.
Porterhouse. Got it.
If you're out of salmon, I guess I'll go with the game pie.
Garcon, if you'd turn the AC up, this wouldn't be a hardship.
I'm sorry, but I needed that ice for my drink.
So is the water tap or spring?
On second thought, instead of the salmon, I'll have the steak.
I appreciate how fresh the salmon is, but I’ll go with the BLT.
After dessert we can talk about global warming.
I see you've taken Baked Alaska off the dessert menu.
Don't you dare order that steak, Brian.
Sorry boss!...but it's raining outside.
Full-employment really changes things.
You are free to use the restroom, but for the table, you need a reservation.
Sorbet, you say?  Instead of  the devil's food or baked-Alaska to finish, hmmm.
Well don’t just stand there
What do you mean you are out or salmon?
Sorry, but they're not serving seal today.
No fish on the menu?
Sorry. I ordered the meat moist and RARE.
Hmm... What’s the most I can get for the bare minimum?
Everything in this city is served a la cart. Including umbrellas I see!
No, there are no seals on the menu here anymore either.
I’m back. I choose eternity on the wall.
Thanks for checking on the Catch of the Day, but I think I'm going to just have a gazpacho.
Waiter! You didn't think I'd notice the water dripping on the floor?
OK.  The special sounds good.  What wine would you pair with the wild-caught salmon?
Out of the salmon?  Let me see what else you have...
How fresh is the calved iceberg?
I asked for sauce on the side
This time make sure the salmon is really fresh!
Sorry, I took your home to put it in my drink.
Why should I let a bad day for the market ruin MY dinner?
Don't you have a drier Chateau Polar?
I’m ready to die. It is as the prophecy foretold.
Can't find food in the pool, huh?
Don’t make me go out there with you.
OK, no fresh salmon - I’ll go with the halibut.
When I was a cub, I didn't know enough to come in out of the rain either.
Yes, I would like to order something from the wet bar.
Just checking to make sure the meat is fresh.
Yeah, I think I changed my mind about that feesh salmon

John Shaw ,Gardiner Maine
Ok, no salmon left. 
Did you  see any left out there?
How awkward, I see you are the Daily Special.
On second thought,tell me about the halibut.
There was a quarter in the toilet.
I'd like mine with extra ice.
Thanks, I’ll just have the burger then.
I assume you are out of ice for my drink, Mr. Polar Bear?
I ordered the 'Sweet and Grisley', not the 'Sweetin' Grizzley'"
So, you insist the salmon is fresh?
Thanks for checking. It sounded like rain but you can never be too sure.
I'd ask you to join me, but I don't know any good ice-breakers.
Playing dead and trying to outrun you didn’t work. Now for Plan C: romance.
Take my ice, please.
No Braised Seal Flipper?  Then I'll have the arctic char with iceberg lettuce.
After you are done ordering your vegan salad and gluten-free bread, would you please fix my home, now that you have completely destroyed it.
I said I wanted a dry wine.
Don't sweat it, bear with me and I'll make my selection soon.
Relax, do I look like Hannah Goldfield?
No thank you. Please send out the Halibut but only if it has not also been previously frozen.
And can I get extra carbon with that?
Which extinct species goes well with wine?
So that’s where the fish are nowadays?!
I would offer you a seat, yet I don't enjoy judgement with my salmon .
You to unbearable for me.
Kiss your species good-by.  You had a good run.
YES!!... I know we were playing fetch at the lake house...
But it's lunchtime & I'm hungry...
Is the seal local?
Why do you always put a dampener on my choices!
We're out of iceberg lettuce and Alaskan salmon.
I'll have the salmon tartar.
...kidding - right?  No salmon!
Don't order the Salmon. It's a bit off.
Ok, so you're out of salmon -- what about the trout?
Sorry to hear the salmon aren't running today.  I guess I'll just have the honey glazed caribou carcass with insect and berry compote.
I'll have the salmon, but don't catch it, just get it from the kitchen.
So the Arctic char is fresh, right?
I wanted the bear pudding, not puddling.
And the wild salmon.  Is it fresh this evening?
Do you know what happened to the little boy who cried menstrual cramps?
Don’t wine when I make a pun, just bear with it.
You aren't the waiter...
You climate change activists are all alike.  My guess is you'd like me to choose the Beyond Burger.
Salmon leaves me cold too. Any halibut?
so your saying the salmon is unavailable?
In that case forget my scotch on the rocks
You should probably add a watch and a raincoat to that list of necessities you have...
Can I help you? I’m currently in “rest and digest” mode.
You claim to be a climate endangered Kodiak and don’t have ‘Baked Alaska’ on your dessert menu?
What's this, a John Irving thing?
Salmon's finished you say? Well I guess I will have the fruit, insect and root ragout after all.
Pooh!PoohPooh! , I see nothing on the menu that catches my eye.
Well, if you’re out of ice I’ll just have my latte hot.
I'm only half way through, bear with me.
It states that the salmon is freshly caught. How Freshly?
I heard they just bring the salmon to you here?
The salmon wasn't quite to my liking.  Guess you'll have
good dumpster-diving later.
Be sure you bring me fresh salmon
Is it true your sockeye salmon is fresh caught and locally sourced?
No, sir. Greenland on the rocks is no longer available.
Are you out of nightcaps, too?
Since you didn't get the salmon, what would you recommend?
I don't care. The catch of the day is salmon and that's what I want.
Is this a gag to push your new sustainability menu options?
Will please check one more time to see if any fresh salmon has come in.
I spilled the water on the way over here. Sorry.
There’re no Popeyes’ Chicken Sandwiches here either.
Okay, I will ask the waiter to set another place. But if you are going to join me for lunch, you need to get cleaned up and dried off.
How fresh is your poached wild salmon with artichoke confit?
So you don't recommend the Baked Alaska?
What happened to the signature wedge salad?
Okay, okay, you've made your point. I won't order the steak!
Well...if you're out of salmon, let's try the trout amandine.
So the salmon is exceptionally fresh
What do you mean the ice has melted,make another root beer float and don't dilly dally this time.
No iceberg lettuce; no braised seal flipper; not even iced tea! This is some bear-bones restaurant.
Global warming, huh? What can I get you?
So, you're sure the Salmon served here is caught fresh daily?
Now Pooh, do be a dear and fetch Christopher Robbin more of this delicious Dom Perignon.
You say the seal is fresh-caught is today?
I'll have another penguin ganache.
Where's the bathroom?
Go away!
I ordered the chicken
What is today's catch?
Still or sparkling?
I've heard of cat fishing, but not bear fishing...
On second thoughtI'll have the burger
So what you're saying is that the "Locally Sourced Fresh Salmon" on the menu will not be available today.
I'm torn between the lasagna and today's catch. Which do you recommend?
Do you sell Pepsi?
It is raining out, and it turns out your coat isn’t waterproof?
Did you get that fresh salmon?
You look grizzlier than usual.
Sit down and I'll order you a Polar Ice on the rocks.
Maybe you should refine your fishing technique. In any case, salmon isn't on the menu tonight.
Since you can’t seem to manage wild-caught,  I suppose I could settle for line-caught salmon.
No, nothing more from the wet barr, thanks."
Sorry, I meant to say that I wanted to finish with a large bowl of pear.
On second thought, I'll have the steak instead of salmon.
Grizzly weather out there.
I ordered the ‘wet pear’, not the ‘wet bear’”
[NOTE: For the purpose of this joke please pretend that ‘wet pear’ is the name of a popular dish. Please. I need this.
Okay.  I don't really have to have the salmon.
I told them I would know if it was really 'wild salmon' ...

Yes I can see that the Alaskan Cod is fresh.
Another glass of polar water please.

You're out of salmon? What other fish do you have?
I’ll have the salmon, but only if it is freshly caught.
Quelle domage!  I was so anticipating the fresh salmon tonight.
I think will take uour suggestion have salmon.  Is it fresh?
Honey, I told you not to track mud!
Tell the waiter, I said a claret.
So that's what was in my soup.
Ok, so you went out to the woods and it's raining. All employees still must wash thier hands before returning to work.
Will you be offended if I order the semifreddo?
Are you eating alone on Saturday evening?
You' re a bear, man!
So this is why there’s no food in your camper.
No, I don't want the iceberg lettuce salad, 
I'd like the chili, and make it extra hot.
I'll have the stuffed salmon in honeycomb.
So you say the salmon's fresh, huh? Sounds like Fake News.
I assumed the fish of the day had already been caught.
You may be wet, but I've got a pig nose on my cheek.
You say you ate all the fresh salmon? How about a fresh bear steak well done!
Why did you try to catch a salmon when the cod here is to die for?
WITH ICE OR WITHOUT?
The entrees here are quite bear.
I asked for rare not extinct
I've gone to our supplier, but I am sorry to say there is not a drop of honey available.

You know what? Forget the salmon. I'll go for the cobb salad instead.
I'll have the salmon, and a large coca-cola with ice.
I guess you're out of arctic char?
The waiter said he'd send someone over to describe the baked Alaska
I know it's a bit extravagant for your bare necessities.
I'll start with a COLD bear!
I'll have the freshly caught salmon, too, please.
Well that answers my question: Does a bear sweat in a seafood restaurant?
The ice caps are melting so I came for your ice bucket
Did you say the bacon is from the 100 Acre Wood?
I don't want your excuses, I said I'll have the salmon.
I am not doubting global warming.
On second thought, I think I'll have the pasta instead of the salmon.
Yes, I too find this humidity unbearable.
I told you, I'm not the one who ordered The Boiled Grizzly!!
Sorry I'm late, I had to wash my hair.
Is that water or drool?
No seal, but they do serve eel.
Just chillin'

I'll have a Coke with no ice.
A bear who’s really wet walks into a room.
My wine is a little dry. What else would you recommend?
I’m sorry, we’re out of fresh salmon.
So, fresh seal is off the menu today?
If you had stayed ice-olated for much longer your health would have really gone south; care for some wine?
Ice melted? Okay instead of this wine I'll take a DRY martini!
Sous vide is actually meant for the entree, not you sir.
Well, cry me a river. I'll have the carbon-neutral, vegan burger and a receipt for my tax credit.
I know you hurried over, but this restaurant requires that you wear a tie.
And don't tell me you're out of the seal.
I was hoping to find baked Alaska on the menu."
Well, I’m trying to think of a stupid pun to say, something that will satisfy the cartoon editors.
You couldn't get a salmon !! You couldn't even just get one tiny little salmon ????
Geez, John, you are so selfish.
I'll take the globally warmed artic seal with a side of iceburg salad.
Your recommendation of the wild caught salmon is most impressive.
The steak here is so good, I've lost my home because of it!
Don't come begging here. I am not personally responsible for global warming. Trump'n tweets let me off the hook.
Well, if the freshly caught salmon is off the menu tonight, I'll have the linguine.

I ordered a 'rare' steak
If this is about global warming, I drive a Tesla so...
You could’ve just ordered koi here, you know.
Would you recommend the baked Alaskan?"
It's unbearably hot in here.
Well, if you are out of fresh salmon, what about fresh trout
So no on the salmon du jour, let’s try the rabbit...
I know it's hot in here, but bear with me
I understand your angst about global warming but my duck confit is getting cold in the kitchen!!
I'd berate you for not bringing an umbrella if you weren't so cuddly.
I changed my mind on the salmon. How is your duck?
Don't just stand there shivering. Go back to the river and bring a salmon for the chef.
Is your salmon wild-caught or farmed?
Well, if you're sure the salmon's unavailable, I'll try the hake.
Nope, you’re not in here.
No doubt you imagine your presence strikes the right note of middle-aged whimsy.
Can you order the salmon for me?
Don't complain to me about global warming. Go to Washington!
I've changed my mind. I don't want the fresh caught salmon after all.
The enabling stops here, Paddington.
It's alright.  I like my martini straight up anyway.
Would it push you over the edge if I order the baked Alaska?
Ummm you do not look like your profile picture”
I am sorry, but I am not ordering the salmon!
Which of the menu items are just right?"
OK, if you are out of salmon can you check if you have any venison.
Instead of fresh-caught salmon, I’ll try the steak.
But if you don't have wild-caught salmon, why is it on the menu?
Okay, if the rainbow trout is no longer available, I'll go for the ratatouille.
So what are your options other than the salmon?
Do you have a favorite you'd recommend?
But how can the salmon be both fresh AND frozen?
On second thought, I don't want the freshly caught salmon after all. Bring me a venison steak.
Is the beef as fresh as the salmon?
You going to drink that?
Ok, you say the salmon is off.
I know, I know, it can't be unseasonably warm every year.
Sorry for being late, I was caught up in global warming.
I changed my order from Tuna to Spinach Ravioli
But honey, it's raining out there.
Can I have a glass of wine?
Well... I suppose the fish are pretty fresh then...
I'm no therapist but I think you could use a little emotional support.
Exactly why can’t I change my fish order?
Don't look at me like that - I asked them to wash down the chair.
Fresh salmon and pic-a-nic baskets is your entire menu?
And you swear that the walrus ceviche is fresh?
I’m guessing you’ll have the salmon.
Can I order you?
I'll have the Arctic Char on Iceberg Lettuce and the Snowballs for dessert.
Uh, no polar seals. Why do you ask?
Will you also be preparing the ratatouille?
Oh, I guess the salmon is as fresh as they say.
There must be some mistake - I ordered the frozen mousse.
On second thought, cancel the freshly caught salmon.
Fresh Salmon for you today sir?
We're all out of iceberg wedges.
Tell me about the wet bear special.
Man they send me out so he orders meat
Try the salmon. It's fresh.
I'll have a VERY dry martini, please.
Both our lives are now more full of warm sunshine than ever before. What are you complaining about?
So...the salmon isn't fresh caught then?
How are your mussels?
So, how's the salmon todat?
Hmm...no more salmon...I guess I'll have a steak.
I don’t see clean fresh wild game here, where’s the waiter?
You're late again.  How can you bear it?
Sit down, have a glass of ice water! I’ll call the president and give him Hell about climate Change.
Yes, I still want baked Alaska.
Sir, the only dessert left on the menu is Baked Alaska.
I'll start with the iceberg lettuce ... on second thought, forget it.
So, you're out of the salmon, let me see, then...
Please ask the mailer d to turn the air conditioning up.
I'm not sure I want salmon tonight.
How's the seal today?
...and the Baked Alaska.
And you say the seal is fresh?
So you're telling me glacial spring water is no longer on the menu?
I’m sure it’s just water weight.
Yes, can you guarantee the Salmon is wild caught, not farm raised?
Global warming is no excuse for a late appetizer.
I'll have water, no ice, and the vegan dinner salad . . . is that OK?
I'm assuming the salmon is fresh
Why yes, I think I’ll have the fish, thank you.
Chill out!
Please go back out and get me a fresh salmon.
So Little Red Riding Hood is not cooking tonight and you're the sous chef?
its melting out there
Actually, I've changed my mind - market price is a rip-off.

Since there is no wild-caught salmon tonight, how is the honey glazed venison?
I don't care how fresh it is. I had the fish last time.
I really had my heart set on the salmon.
Order the salmon, it’s really fresh!
Just in time! I heard the salmon is pretty good.
I don't care if the seal steak is fresh, I want the haddock.
So I assume the salmon is fresh!
So your recommendation is the Arctic salmon versus the local trout down here?
Sorry we ran out of Salmon , and it wasn’t me this time , there’s just none left in the river , this climate change thing is something else.
Yes,Clive---I DO appreciate the fact that the salmon special was just swimming in the river 'literally moments ago',but I still want the damn strip steak...blood rare."
I'll have the salmon...without grill marks.
You said you were going to change before you met me.
Is the salmon farmed?
Geez- You couldn't at least have toweled off a bit?!? What does This Say about our First Date?!? "     JK Fuller. Genoa, N
Screw global warming. For dessert I want the Baked Alaska.
Halloween isn't for another month
No, no, no. I asked for pasta primavera. Not a homeless polar bear.
No, our NYC subways don't go anywhere near northern Alaska, but  an economy flight from JFK to Juneau is a good start.
I'd like the salmon you just caught.
Been fishing for salmon all afternoon. Promise me you will order it.
Sir, please don't order the salmon well done. I just caught it.
OK, now I'm worried. I could've sworn I chose a lobster.
Let me guess:  you couldn't bear the heat, so you got out of the kitchen?
I guess I can't get that with iceberg lettuce.

The salmon is wild-caught, I caught it myself and I am wild.
It appears we're all out of the Catch of the Day.
I hope this is a dry wine.

to offer Baked Alaska.

So, tell me more about your "Drowned Polar Bear" cocktail.
Is this magic realism or did I just eat bad shrimp?
Don’t you know global warming is a hoax? Rush said so.
Pull up a chair before my wife gets here.
I said I wanted an iced cold BEER,  not an iced cold BEAR!
You can have the salad. How does that sound?
I assume you're out of iceberg lettuce, then...?
I'll have it stirred, not shaken.
When I asked for an iced tea, this isn't what I meant.
The baked Alaska, is it prepared to order?
There must be something you have here that's really good to make you drool like that.
I'll have a glass of the Ca-bear-net, please.
No, no, no, honey
The furry convention is next weekend.
Can I get you something to drink?
I asked for a Polar Bear on the rocks.
Would you like some water with your wine?
Yes, salmon is always good, but I’m up for a little rainbow trout tonight.
I asked for the bull-market climate-change-denial menu and this is what I get?

I should have known better than to ask you for salman
So you'd recommend the chef special?
Exactly how fresh is the salmon?
No  salmon?  I’ll just have the house salad.
The backstroke?
My request was a sweet, NOT a sweat!!
I’m sorry what climate change has done to your environment, but there is no salmon on this menu either.
Have you thought about cold warehouse lifter?
Do you recommend the 'American Buffalo'?
No bare feet allowed.
Waiter? Did you send a bear to catch my salmon oh MY GOD.
I don't think you'd like the fish, Smokey!
I've changed my mind-what vegan specials do you have?
I won.
What! You’re out of ice?
Ahh, the salmon is local I see? Good, good.
My wife is right there! I'll tell her soon, but for now, you need to go.
I meant Beurre Noir.
So if  you are out of the Salmon ...
We're  sorry to have to tell you, sir, that the fresh Columbia River salmon has escaped.
Let me guess, you're out of the fish.
Not quite what I meant when I sent the meat back for being too old and dry.
You're sure the salmon is wild!
For the last time, I don’t want the special.
Okay I would go with bake Alaska.
Yes, I’m gonna have a large bowl of the bear stew.
No luck on the salmon, huh? Gimme grubs and berries ala Gentle Ben.
I changed my mind, instead of the fresh salmon, I'll go with the osso buco milanese.
Just swam in from North Pole! No ice on tap for drinks!
If there's no fresh salmon,I'll have a steak.
Is the bear sweat glaze fresh?
I suppose you'd  like something dry, like a merlot?
I'll pass on the Baked Alaska.
So the salmon is wild and not farmed?
Water your thoughts on the Atlantic salmon?
Well if there is no fish I'll have the venison
I think I'll have the fresh, wild caught salmon.
It's cold outside today. Please serve me something warm.
This is the time of year when you can’t figure out whether you should keep the air conditioner on or open the windows.
You seem like the wrong fellow to recommend something dry.
Now you show up! After I am done.
Nope -- I don't see ice on the menu ...
Yes. But is it purified?
I m sorry sir we are out of fresh salmon
Can I get you more water?
You should have used the men's room on such a rainy day.
How is the King Crab?
So how’s the fresh caught salmon?
Changed my mind about the salmon. Let's have the burger, rare.
OK, so you don't have the wild caught salmon?
I’ll just have tap water!
I'll have a steak dipped in your homemade drops.
You can stop drooling because I'm not on the menue.
Sorry I'm late, my glacier road melted so had to swim here- so much for all that talk of infrastructure improvement.
I don't care how hard it was to find a cab in this weather, you simply can't keep standing me up like this!
On second thought, I'd like the steak.
I’d keep away from the baked Alaska.
I'd advise against the Baked Alaska.
What do you mean you didn't catch any salmon?
On second thought, I'll take the coho salmon.
Have you tried the fresh wild caught salmon?
No, you don't look like a little black rain cloud.  You look like a dripping wet bear.  And this isn't honey, it's the house chardonnay.
I'd say the outlook is bearish for a good meal here...
Oh,it does say "Fresh Bear Meat ".
I asked for a cold
I'll pass on this one.
Well, if the fresh salmon isn't available, I'm going to need another minute.
They say, the rain will change to snow.
I’d like to know just how fresh the salmon is today.
I'm sorry climate change has ruined your habitat and you're starving. But is that any reason to spoil my meal. Beg at the back door with the other riff raff.
Is the wild salmon fresh or frozen?”
1) You say the salmon is fresh caught?
2) Is the salmon North Atlantic or  farm fresh?
What did you catch today? The Chinook Salmon or the Sockeye?
Yes that's right, I want the Baked Alaska.
I'll have the catch of the day.
Okay, you win. I'll have the baked Alaska.
Offering  a variety of sorbet, frozen yogurt. Yes, sir, a migrant, homelessness issues in Arctica. Ice cream parlor retraining program
The cedar plank salmon - does it come with any sides?
I’d recommend the salmon sushi.
Why yes, I did order the beef.
So you're out of fresh salmon, eh?
No wild caught Salmon, eh? OK, I"ll just have a steak.
The bull came by before you and told me I could order anything I want.
Don't tell me you just ran out of the stew.
Well chef, now I understand why my Salmon was wet, raw and covered in hair.
I assume the fish is fresh caught today?
Which one is the Drip?
How long is the wait for Baked Alaska?
You say there's no salmon tonight.
I say ‘just grin and bear it.’
Bear with me here. Itp
Bear with me, I'm almost ready to order.
What do you want honey I'm rushed off my feet ?
This used to be a burger joint when I was younger. Seal belly? Damn Scandinavians.
No! You may not have my cube!
I'll have the salmon, if there’s any left.
This cork is not moist. Is the sommelier hibernating?
I'm pretty sure I've ordered berries on ice cream
Is it too late to cancel my salmon order?
The nearest fish dinner?
I said medium rare, not rare and still dripping.
After I order you're going to hear such a primal scream!
I want the freshest salmon you have
Would you like some water with ice?
On second thought, I'll have the beef.
But the menu says "ice"
Sorry I don't see Salmon on the menu....
So let me guess, you braved the wilderness to find a parking spot.
Sorry to disappoint you - 
that's just the Good Housekeeping Seal on the menu.
Chef Special, Fresh Salmon...
Sorry, the red doesn’t come with ice.
You wouldn’t think WET people walking all over you would be that much worse.
Things are tough these days, check on Craig's list under 'Cold Storage,' there might be some industrial refrigeration units for rent.
No fresh-caught salmon? It’ll be the pasta, then. With a side of garbage.
Leaner.
I'd like the fresh salmon, please.
I'll have the dry martini instead.
Couldn't you have chosen a sunnier day to  search again for Goldilocks?
I'm so over avocado toast...have we not moved on?
Swordfish is pricey, but who's counting? It's us who forced you to migrate.
I’ll start with the Iceberg Lettuce salad and for my entire I’ll have the freshly caught salmon.
Bear with me, you're salmon has to be fresh caught
somehow.
Yes, it's wild caught
so, no more salmon...what else is fresh?
I think I will have the Baked Alaska?
When you warm up, would you mind giving me your recommendations on the menu?
OK, if you're all out of fresh salmon what else have you got?
Hmmm! Let's see ... I'll have the ... no wait ... I think I'll take the ... hold it!  Um ... bring me....
I take it the salmon is fresh caught, then.
So I take it "stewed bear" is no longer available?
Finally, someone who can appreciate this barely drinkable wine.
Yes, of course, I was planning on ordering only sustainable fish.
You look beary wet.
I heard you had to take an inside job with all the icebergs melting.
If it's global warming, then why are you so wet?
Unusual weather we’re having, ain’t it?
Tell me a little more about your Baked Alaska.
I changed my mind about the salmon, I think I’ll have the prime rib
How does climate change put ME on the menu?
Try me again when the wine quality declines and prices inflate.
Okay, thanks for checking, you can hold the ice!
I’ll have the rainwater-marinade broiled bear special, if it’s fresh.
So you're saying that you're out of the salmon?
Is it too late to cancel my fresh salmon order?
I'll take a double - on the rocks
Are you sure there’s no more Salmon?
Is the salmon fresh?, wait, no, I'll have a salad.
Alright, if you don't have the salmon, then I guess I'll go with the honey barbecue chicken.
I didn't realize the bear claw came with the rest of the bear.
I still consider the service here unbearable.
Would you care for a huge slab of ice?
I’m almost ready to order.  Please bear with me.
No no no, I said the BERRY tart.
How's the fried aardvark? And, hint, hint, I can't "bear" the smell in here. Get it? Get it? Burp! I'm your customer!
Besides an umbrella,what else can you recommend
Tonight's special is fresh caught salmon.
Let me guess, you'll be having our salmon.
Actually, do you have Atlantic salmon?
Not so sure that this "providing a unique and quintessentially  different dining experience" was such a good idea.  I'm a sweaty mess!   Maybe a bunny costume?
So you do come in a sauce.
I’ll have the twice-baked planet platter, please.
I'll take the Arctic Melting Special. Make it well done. I want it cooked all the way through.
Sir, could you do something about the climate out there?
Don’t be nervous, I’m married.
I didn’t mean for you to stop hibernating and get some ice from the glacier.
If that's a dry Martini I sure could use one.
And I suppose the two dozen water balloons were too much, too, Bear?
Do you recommend the Arctic Tuna Melt?
You might want to try something hot.
1
Which do you recommend – the beef tartare, the T-Bone or the burger?
So you don't have any dry wines?
I'll have the baby harp seal.  Beaten, not stabbed.
" You must be another casualty of global warming."
Looks like climate change cut into your hibernation, huh?
I flew 2000 miles and you’re out of fresh Salmon?  If  you’re fond of your job, I’d try harder...
On second thought, never mind. I just remembered I'm allergic to seal
If you can’t handle a little taunting, you shouldn’t have gotten captured.
That would be all Bearson
I see nothing on this menu for a wet bear.
No thank you, I think I'll have the steak tonight.
I will have the fresh fish.
Is the salmon mouth or net caught?
I thought I came here for dinner,
but instead you remind me about the dangers of the bear market.
I've heard about 'singing in the rain', but I've never heard about 'a bear in the rain'....haha that was joke
Forget the water
I knew it was a bad idea to have Italian delivered to my campsite that one time
I'll have bear claw ice cream on the dry side.
Are you sure the salmon is Catch of the Day?
I'm sorry your iceberg melted, but they have no fresh fish on the menu.
Well, global warming certainly would have done my lukewarm appetizer some good.
What do you mean, seals are off the menu due to some sort of climate thing?
What.
Do you have any ice in your drink?
I think you've mistaken the value of iceberg lettuce on several levels.
I'd like a really dry martini
Teddy, I'm sorry I flushed you twenty years ago...let me order you a Listerine.
The first bear to bring bad news.
There’s no salmon here either, I’ve already checked. Did you really think being a pescatarian was good for the environment?
The kokotxas melt in your mouth.
Afraid there isn't any 'seal steak' listed here... let me order the salmon, I'm sure they can bring that right out.
I see it’s raining in the woods.
This is not what I meant by "Baked Alaska."
BARE hugs anyone?
Is the honey-glazed salmon rare or cooked through?
OK, so your out of the Salmon....
Don't make me feel guilty for ordering the steak.  I'm not causing the global warming that lost you your home.
I would like an Earth, well done.
Well then I'll have the hot Vichyssoise instead!
Sorry. I thought you said, “no ice.”
Actually, I think I'll have the steak.
Sir  We are running out of ice up there! Do you have any to spare
You already said the salmon was wild caught, but how much more will it cost me?
Sorry but I would like some ice.
What do you recommend-baked Alaska or drenched Grizley?
I'll have the Beaufort , "South Carolina" , Polar bear steak well done and losing ground
Let me guess? You can't BEAR to see me dine alone?
They haven't had seal on the menu here for at least three months. Sorry.
...and a glass of your driest Cabernet Sauvignon to keep for yourself.
It says, “fresh caught, wild salmon”; but is it really fresh?
Where's my Catch-of-the-Day wild caught salmon?
i'm getting cancelled for this one
The menu clearly gives me the option of drenched or dry.  Take yourself back -- I clearly ordered "dry."  Thank you.
I’d heard this place had everything drenched in sauce but this is unexpected.
Ummm, I don't see you on the menu.
I suppose this means you don't have the arctic cherry cheesecake.
Sommelier, regarding this wine recommendation, you're all wet!
What do you know about the iceberg lettuce?
Would you send over the sommelier instead? I 've a good feeling you have other tables waiting.
Bear with me, please: I said waiter, not water
So you wouldn't recommend the Baked Alaska?
No, I won´t change one damn habit just because of climate changes!
The chips are soggy.”  Don Dechman, Austin, T
Sorry, give me five minutes, I'm still looking.
asdf
So, the salmon is wild caught.  Now, can you tell me more about the farm raised organic chicken?
I jour you're ordering vegetarian
Could you send over the sommelier, my wine has a wet bear nose to it.
No, I don't care about the loss of ice world-wide. As you can see, I drink red wine.
If  all you are going to do is stand there and tell me that it's my fault that the ice caps are melting, I would be appreciative if you would just go away.  Um, is the penguin fresh?
Did I miss the honey?!"
"She's not coming.
Hmmm.  Bear stew.  It says it's locally sourced.
Hey, am I sweating?
Ah, I see a little stopover in the rain forest, anyhoo I’ll have a steak
It says here that the name of this restaurant is Market St.
I’ll have the specials: East River seafood risotto, with the Upper Bay otter tartar to start.
I said, "mousse flambe," not "ours mouillé!"
It's 's 80 degrees in October and still, they turned the heat on in the subway. Where are we Del Boca Vista Phase III?
Something wrong waiter? You're a little early for Halloween.
Alaska is melting, so I'm afraid we won't be serving 'Baked Alaska' tonight!
I’m with Greta sand I’m here to say the ice bergs are melting.  At the very  least choose a vegan entree ! “
Looks like you had no luck. They have a great salmon on the menu.
Are the salmon line caught or netted?
I don't know -- you (italics)say the salmon was fresh-caught this morning.
Dude you smell like a wet dog get out of here.
Sorry I’m late. I missed the train.
You're desperate enough to interrupt my first course?
You want ice no water?
Ok.  I'll go with your suggestion and try the seal.
Ahh, the bear who came in from the cold?
I guess that rules out iceberg lettuce.
Are you still serving today Baking Alaska?
No ice left in the Arctic! Need to get in the freezer room!
Sorry about the water. Employees are required to wash hands after *hitting in the woods
I just couldn't bear it if this was an iceberg lettuce salad.
When it says 'Fresh Salmon'...just how fresh is that?
Is the seal fresh?
I'm warming towards the Baked Alaska, please?"

Or, for British readers:

"Give me an Arctic Roll.
How's the iceberg salad?
what's the weather like today
You're out of salmon? Damn, climate change.
What might you suggest for a really juicy meat?
we have no picnic baskets here.
I asked for ice in my water.
you smell like shit
You hear about this climate boloney?
urall wet
I’m assuming that you are not recommending the Baked Alaska.
Any Iceberg Salad left?
I'll have the fresh-caught wild salmon.
No, no, Harold...I said leaks!
What's the sauce on the wild game special tonight?
Me? I'm barely hungry.
« Wet you want, sir »
« A wet martini, if you can bear it. »
How fresh would you say the Salmon is here?
I thought the cheese sweating was unbearable
I am telling you that your wife is not cheating on you and you're simply smelling the salmon."
What's that Honey? Did you say bear with me?
Did it try to evade capture?
Remember ice? I'll ask the waiter to bring you some.
They’re out of the fish...
When they said the salmon was fresh, I didn't think they meant this fresh
I know it's a poor substitute, but try a glass of ice wine.
Could I have the salmon, please? Medium rare, and a glass of tap water?
Oh that's right, you wan't the iceberg.
Waiter, I am barely hungry.  What can you suggest?
I understand the salmon was freshly caught today.
Well, the fries from the doggy bag were always soggy so...
I'm only interested in your free-range offerings.
Nope.  No seal on the menu. Try farther north."
How can you guarantee that the Alaskan salmon is fresh caught?
Excuse me, but I ordered the venison.
I know the salmon is wild caught and fresh but I'm leaning toward the farm raised taco.
On second thought, hold the spice.
I thought was ordering a cocktail.
Don't sweat it, I'm not ordering polar bear.
Do you recommend the arctic char or salmon?
and you're sure the salmon's fresh-caught?
I'll go with my usual stuffed rabbit; and Bobby, great halloween get-up.
Fuck dude get me a towel!!!
The fish was not fresh, therefore bring me some honey"
Sorry, is "Baked Alaska" a trigger phrase for you?
This place bearily has any standards in the form of waiters.
Since you're sure there's no fish in the stream, you're out of honey lattes, I'll  have a grilled  bear claw.
Excuse Me. Is the Salmon fresh?
I  see they canceled the salmon special
OK. So you're completely out of salmon. How about trout?
Welcome to Hooters, I’m sorry for all the sweat dripping everywhere, but these new uniforms are hot.”
So,do you think you'll have salmon later in the week?
Ok then, let's go with the freshly picked iceberg lettuce
Kudos for catching fresh salmon!  I'll have it poached, please.
I’ll take the Arctic shaved ice in vanilla...
I’ll have sparking water instead
I'll go with your recommendation of the fresh caught salmon.
I asked for a Barely poached egg... Why is it so wet?
Global warming may be enhancing the terroir, but I still don't want that beerenauslese you keep touting.
Forget the salmon--I'll have the tenderloin.
Ah, yes! You will be delicious! Even fresher than lobster!
For seafood, I'd prefer Flounder.
I hear some wild salmon have been particularly aggressive this season.
Is the freshly-caught salmon Coho or King?
Everything is a la carte. Why do you ask?
...and bring me my order before you go back in the pool.
No, you cannot crash with me until this interstadial is over.
You don't even look like Owsley Stanley!
Could you turn down the A/C a little?
Bear with me sir its grizzly out there today
Everyone’s taking the weekend to fish so thought why not
Oh no the ice in my drink is all gone, I'm gonna ask the waiter for some more.
Ah! Just the fellow to bring me up to date on the new Northwest Passage!
Yes, the pool is heated to 65, now can I have breakfast?
Yeah, it sounds awful...I'll have the surf and turf.
Baled Alaska is kind of your thing, right?
Well, how about making a cheese MELT if you're such an expert?
I know this may sound inappropriate, but I’d like the Baked Alaska for desert please.
Can you get me a sizzler steak and hot coffee?
You were wise to go ahead and order. I had to swim most of the way again. These arctic hurricanes are hell on a guy's sense of direction.
The exotic endangered dish please!
Kindly bear with me.
So you say you caught the fresh Alaskan salmon yourself?
Yes, I will try the bear meat. But not 'au jus.'
What items are market priced today?
On second thought, I don't want the fish.
Since you're out of salmon I'll have the shark steak instead.
I would prefer the mousse, dry.
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU DECDIDED TO COME IN ,OUT OF THE RAIN !
I'll have the Polar Icecap and the Arctic Melt.
Sorry, we have no more ice
Let's see, if you're tired of salmon the venison looks good....
I ordered bruinswager, not bruinswater
You made a wrong turn. The marathon ends in Bear Mountain!
Here to gloat? YES everyone, this bear can swim in my pool whenever it pleases and there isn’t a thing I can do about!
For dessert, I'll have Baked Alaska Flambé---and make it snappy, I'm hungry.
Absent father, distant mother --- I'm guessing your technique needs some demos, Lawrence.
I'll have the Arctic Salmon for my entré, followed by the Baked Alaska for dessert; or is it desert?
On second thought, prime rib pairs better with red wine than salmon does.
I think that's enough white wine for tonight. I'm switching to beer.
Yes, I was just wanting to ask about the fresh-caught salmon on the menu.
What do you mean *you're* the baked Alaska?
I was planning on trying something from the sous vide menu, however...
You’re ordering food but I’m the hungry one and just can’t bear it
Can you get Iceberg lettuce in your salad? What does this look like, Arby's?
OK, Baked Alaska is problematic...
Come to think of it, I'd prefer a cold Bear Beer
This is not what I imagined when you said on Grinder you were a sloppy bear
Stop giving me those puppy dog eyes, Cindy! I’m still getting that divorce.
When the waitress is so tired, that you are the waitress
Hey, I ordered a Polar Bear martini with a twist!
I'll have the Almond Crusted Salmon in Honey Garlic Sauce.
On the bright side, you don't have to change clothes -
That salmon tasted like it just came out of the ocean.
Could you catch a salmon for me now ?
Your date was swimming in my lake. That's why she's late.
I they don't change the special soon, I am going to give the chef "wet fur"
Yes, my name is Seale, but it's spelled with a final 'e'.
Do you recommend the filet of seal?
Do you see any seals in there? We've run out of those.
Is your cellar climate controlled?
Are you sure you don't have the salmon?
Guest: This should be served chilled...
Bear: I’m doing my best.
...and the catch of the day is salmon.
On second thought, instead of the smoked salmon get me the grilled venison.
Late again because you couldn't find an ice cap?
I would like the climate change scotch, no rocks!
I don’t think I can help - I asked for no ice in my drink.
Um, sir, I'm not in love with this bearded seal; could you go out and fetch me the beluga whale instead?
Hmmm.  I guess I'll have your special, the baked Alaska, for dessert.  Sorry.
...  and a side of the polar bear soup please.
Ok, that's our fresh caught salmon catch of the day and your choice of vegetables sir?
Bear melt? No thanks, I'll have a Tuna melt.
Well I didn't want seal meat anyway. How about whale? Bring me a whale steak sautéed with onions and mushrooms.
Actually, I’ve changed my mind about that fresh-caught salmon.
This is when Jim realized, he had been ‘catch fished’ by a bear.
No,I don't see seal. They do have a nice iceberg salad,though.
...And another one of the Salmon with Ravus Ursi saliva foam.
I’ve decided against the honey glazed salmon.
I’m afraid they store the towels with the Dom — in a bear bag.
For dessert, I believe the bearclaws will be suitably moist.
I'll take your fresh caught salmon, but don't get near that martini.
Venison with hot sauce is a no-go, you say?
Still raining? Join me. The salmon is excellent.
If it's not properly chilled, then no.
I ordered the Mouse not the Baked Alaska.
You wouldn't happen to serve fresh, handpicked cod would you?
Worry not. I don’t eat bear meat.
I'll have today's special, your Baked Alaska,
Sorry sir, but we've runout of ice.
Of course you're late.  It's impossible to get a cab when it's raining, even if you don't eat the driver.
Look, I get that your glaciers are melting as we speak but I still would like that Creamy Broccoli soup I ordered.
Is the trout medium or full bodied?
I asked for a dry martini.
If you don't have the wild salmon today, then I'll have the fresh bear claw instead.
One more baked Alaska, please.
Sorry, sir, we're all out of iceberg lettuce
Waiter, I ordered a Martini but this one is Bearly dry.
Climate change in the wine cellar, huh?
I hope you can bare the long wait.
How's the bear tartare?
Please let me offer you a towel to dry off.  And when you're done, I'll have a nice dry French Red with my steak frites.
I’m sorry sir, the stream out back is out of the fresh salmon shown on the menu.
No salmon? And I thought this restaurant was supposed to be a great catch.
Your salmon is overcooked, can I speak to your matador?
Farm-to-table variety.  Check.
Farm-to-table efficiency. Check.
Farm-to-table edibility.  Uh, Waiter, please !?!?!?
...so I said to him, 'Sure, if you give me tangible proof that climate change is real, I'll believe you...'
Polar spring water please - still, if you will.
this little bear went to the market...
What do you mean you are out of ice cream?
I certainly appreciate fresh salmon, but I'm more in the mood for beef.
Look -- it you don't find me something delicious from your Endangered Species menu --right now! -- YOU are gonna be endangered.
No, I most certainly do not have 
Truffle Honey
I see you escaped from global warming !
I've changed my mind.  I'll take the Venison.
Great effort getting that salmon.  Now get me a bear claw.
Baked Alaska please---but I'm in no hurry---could you wait about eight hundred years?
Does this mean it's too late to cancel my climate change order?"
It was meant to come 'on the rocks'
Would you settle for a wedge salad with iceberg lettuce?
What's the holdup on that ice water?
I'm sure the salmon is fresh but this MRSP is too much to bear.
The salmon looks good. How fresh is it?
If the salmon isn't fresh caught, I'm not interested.
I see on the menu that the fish is sourced locally, is that accurate?
I know your habitat is changing but this place would not appeal to your plate.
Really Zincke, you’re going to order the Salmon after drilling in my home?
So how fresh is the salmon today!!
May I see the vintage wine list from the tundra?
Melting polar bear ice sculpture. In your face metaphors are quite tedious, but the wine list is worth it.
What do you mean you’re the of I’ve?
OK,I get it,post hibernation hunger. How about I order 2 kale salads?
Are you certain the salmon isn't farm raised?
How can you be out of Iceberg salad?
What other type of fresh salmon do you have?
"You're in luck.  They have farm raised."
I’d like ice cream for dessert, but based on the look of things perhaps I shouldn’t have anything that requires a deep freeze.
I'll have the wild-caught sustainable Alaskan salmon.
I asked for a drizzle of bearnaise, not a dripping grizzly bear
I see, fresh Market St specials, stock Bear or Bullish choice.
Sorry Sir...we're completely out of ice.
I don't understand why you aren't happy that you no longer have to live on ice. Just make sure my arctic char dinner is fresh.
I'll have the medallions of bearded seal, the narwal hash, the ribs of young walrus Florentine, and ice water.
Oh there you are... On second thought,
I’ll try the halibut instead.
I assure you the filet of salmon almondine is fresh, sir, as I just caught it myself.
I don't see 'plastic-free fish' on the menu.
I told you to stop hibernating at 6 p.m. SHARP!
And why is the portfolio underwater?
It seems I'm not the only one who would like an iceberg salad.
So, you guarantee the fish is fresh-caught?
But fish and seal are on the menu!
Can you do Earth anything but well-done?
I'm sorry the polar ice cap has melted. But no, I won't order you the whole seal. It's $35!
So, the salmon’s off, but frankly it was a little tough
Everyone has to wait in line with patience as they will be treated  irrespective of discriminations, be it even a an Animal!
May I recommend the the climate heated Encrusted Salmon, it's about a degree-in-a-half cooler than the oven baked!
Yes, I will have the fresh fish.  Thank you!
Leif Griffin, Missoula, Montana
I'll have a soggy-bear sandwich.
Ok. The salmon's wild. Now tell me about the honey.
Sorry, but they say they're fresh out of the salmon here, too!
I was going to order the polar bear frozen yogurt for dessert but on second thought I think I'll have the melted vanilla ice cream.  How does that sound?
I'm sorry, but herring is not on th menu.
May I order the bear steak without the wet hair small?
If you're out of fish, I'll just have a bear claw.
Just remembered I’m having salmon tomorrow night.  Can you ask your humpback whale if the shrimp’s any good?
Don't tell me, you're out of the Bull Market Special.
On second thought,I'll order the Polar dip instead of the French dip.
Sorry, there are no more salmon.
Tell me again, how fresh is the salmon?
So yes then...the salmon. Too late to put in for the chocolate soufflé?
Well, I didn’t order baked Alaska for you.
I heard you have air conditioner down here.
I'll have the iceberg wedge, unless you're out again.
“What are you leaning toward big guy?  Maybe a fish out of water?”
I see the inequitable Coke-to-ice cube ratio has you in a hot spot, too
Is the cold turkey a necessity?
I’m so sorry sir! I asked for better wine, not wetter ursine.
May I suggest the Wet Mutt lager
I see you came back without the salmon I ordered.
Excuse me, dear bear, my face friend and I would like to enjoy our dinner. This is a five star restaurant, not a bar suited for a wet bear!
would you please tell me a bit more about your 'Catch of the Day'?
Another hurricane. Wilted iceberg. Fried Calamari. Top it off with baked Alaska!
What it took to catch the lunch special!
Oh, so NOW you want your porridge to be too hot?
This menu is all berries and forging stuff as well as salmon. Is the fish fresh?
I can't believe he ordered without me, he seemed like such a mentch in his profile
Honey, you can just order the salmon.
Prey. I told the waiter I wanted to select from the prey options.
Don't sweat it-you can get the salmon!
Actually, forget the salmon and bring me the pork chops.
Sorry. You can’t order ice from the menu - it’s missing here too!
This restaurant’s customer service is unbearable!
This is not what I meant when I ordered my salad barely wet.
I see the Polar Bear Steak bearnaise is fresh tonight.
Is that broiled seal fresh or frozen?
Let's see...Arugula, Romaine, Oak Leaf...
No, definitely no Iceberg.
Did you say you wanted yours to be beary well done?
No fresh salmon?  I'll try the rabbit.
I thought the reviews said "Wet Bar" not "Wet Bear"
Alaskan, you say.  I think I will try the Wet Bear.
Alright . . . no on the fresh salmon. How about the baby quail?
No. Could you please go back and tell the waiter I prefer my bear not marinated?
Baked Alaska sounds good.
Not too dry with a flamboyant nose.  Is that really you?
I don't see the salmon I requested.
This Climate Change is really doing a number on me I'm perspiring more than ever before!
Wait-bear? WAIT-bear. Excuuuse me, wait-bear! God! why is it so hard to get your attention? I'll have the salmon, please.
Do you know, I think I’ll have the same again!
Come to think of it, I will have that IPA.
Are you sure you're out of fresh salmon? Would you mind checking again? You might want to check the Penobscot River, I hear they're making a comeback.
When I order salmon, I expect salmon. Not excuses.
Actually I’ve changed my mind in the fresh salmon. I’ll have the bee’s honey
Oh, so you couldn't get the herring? How about a seal tenderloin?
Sorry,how fresh did you say the salmon is?
The rain is unbearable.
Master, the steak is a total disaster!
Sorry, I'm going to change my mind on that salmon
For the gazillionth time, I don't want a Coke!
Thanks, F$&%ing thanks!!!
The service portion of the Court of Masters Sommelier exam had fried the nerves of some of the industry’s toughest wine pros. “And,” Katow-jo fretted, “none of those people was even a bear.”
I oversee the catch of the day. Would you like to hear our specials?
I guess the salmon is fresh enough, but is it sourced sustainably?
Today’s “Global Warming” specials: fresh glacier water and Polar Bear melt. At least you enjoyed being free-range.
Relax. Pull up a chair.
We'll have the salmon here.
And one fresh Salmon for my good man.
I understand that the Penguin in really fresh but I want salmon.  Should I be talking with a waiter that's more grizzly?
hey, can you bear with me ..haha
I'll have the berry souffle with barely and berries..hahah
Hey waiter-- I have a bear in my soup...hahahahha
So then, when you ran out of food you migrated here. No offense my friend, but I don't want to know your life story. I just want to give you my order.
I ordered the salmon not the bear
May I borrow that tablecloth? 5 Michelin star restaurants are too avant-garde for dry ones anyway.
No salmon, eh? How about scallops?
Take a break.  My red wine won't work with the salmon.
Yes, I realized the polar ice caps are melting, but can if I order a raw fish can we discuss it after I have finished this glass of wine?
do you have those fresh fish I asked for?
I like bear but you look thawed.
The fresh salmon?  Um, no.  I think the sauteed bear claws, the seasonal vegetables, and, um . . .
I’ll not have the bear steak if it has been defrosted.
Forget the salmon I'll have the veal.
Where you in the rain? Because you’re beary drizzly
Yes, I believe you when you say the salmon is freshly caught.
If everybody was kung fu fighting, and they were doing it faster than lightning, and they all had expert timing, wouldn’t it be more than just a little bit frightening?
No excuses. You should be able to get me the salmon.
Okay, no fresh salmon.  How about the flounder?
I told you al fresco was a bad idea tonight.
And you're part of this "Absolutely freshest fish available anywhere" promotion?
I've been asked: “Do you usually dine alone?" 
"No," I say. "I always dine with a book. The wet bear is god company too.”
No upstream salmon this your is your problem.
What do you mean you don't need a menu?
You say that you checked on the salmon, but how I can be sure?
Baby, I treat you right. Expensive dinner AND a fur coat!
Oh come on, you're a bear..just grin and bear it.
On second thought, I had the salmon last night.
I believe the north is out the front door to the right.
Don't blame me, I ordered ice with my drink.
I'll have the fresh caught salmon, grilled.
How about a vodka iceberg?
I'll have today's special.

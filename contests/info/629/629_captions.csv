In retrospect, I should have been more specific when I told the genie I wanted to be in a rock group and have women climbing all over me.
My therapist said I should try to be a little boulder.
What makes this worse is that there is a racket ball court on the other side
No matter what I say I end up with a foot in my mouth.
Be sure to tell your friends you climbed the face of Everett.
Go ahead. Use me to get to the top.
...and then for my third wish I said, 'I want women climbing all over me!'
I'm lucky! Most geologists don't find a job in their field right out of college.
It's not a career.  It's just a stepping stone.
I was desperate. It was this, or White House press secretary.
For the record, I was opposed to the wall.
So it’s more than a flesh wound, but I’m still a head.
It's not so bad, my brother's a speed bump.
Sorry I’ve been so hard to get a hold of
I wouldn't. It's a toupee.
You'd be even more surprised if you were climbing in the room behind me.
They said they needed someone to fill an opening .....
The ad said "meet challenging women in a relaxed environment..."
Is it just me or does anyone else dread these corporate team building activities?
Remember, be nice to the people you pass on the way up, we'll be here on your way down.
We can't all make Mt. Rushmore.
Cliff?
You might get past me, but good luck with the glass ceiling.
The headhunter promised the position was a mid-level stepping stone.
In order to master the wall, you must become the wall.
I tried to cancel my gym membership.
Please scratch my nose
So yeah, I guess you could say I'm between a rock and a hard place right now.
Would you be willing to answer a few questions about your customer experience?
Please tell the manager I've had an accident on the trapeze in the next room.
I'm being supportive. Isn't that what you want?
Whatsamatter, never climb a rock face before?
When they said I'd be the new head of the company, I probably should have asked a few questions.
That is not a rock your foot is on.
Stay in school.
The ad read 'Support Staff.' Go figure
I have a degree from Trump University
It's still better than trying to meet people online.
I'm more of a social climber.
I used to be a doormat, now I'm a stepping stone.
You look familiar.  Six narrow, right?
Psst, some advice... don't try to cancel your membership early.
You won’t believe the rent I’m paying for this hole in the wall
The head hunters got me
They said I was dumb as a rock, so I interviewed for the job and walah!
Really Howard, you've taken stalking to a new level.
Am I stoned? Or am I high?
I've been taken for granite all my life.
Could you scratch my nose first?
Well, yes, one of us is probably hallucinating.
A geology degree doesn't get you much these days.
Cliff. What's yours?
Most people find me rappelling.
i should have said something... i just wish i'd been a little boulder
I know, but at least I get dental.
Dad- I can handle this!
I worked in the White House before this. I’m used to getting stepped on.
When they said I'd be the face of the company, this isn't what I had in mind.
It’s required training for all White House staffers now.
Underarm deodorant, just saying.
Worst unpaid internship EVER!
It's not great, but it's a step up from my last job.
Looks like you're between a rock and a hard face
Go ahead, everybody else does.
If you owe these people, pay them, no matter what.
Dad, go home.  I’m o.k.
Just when I started to think my life couldn't get any more rocky, I hit a wall.
Would you mind giving me a hand? I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.
I'll warn you, it's a toupee.
I shouda known, when I applied for a job at The North Face.
The last thing I remember is wearing a "Build the Wall!" t-shirt to the gym...
Will you remember me when you get to the top?
You don't want to know what the climbers on the other side are doing to me.
It hurts when people say I'm not supportive enough.
It's OK, Carolyn. Sometimes you have to step on your friends to get to the top.
My counselor tried to warn me about double majoring in geology and performance art
Actually, this is a step up. My last job was as a speed bump, before that I was White House Press Secretary.
Some jerk wondered what would happen ‘if these walls could talk’
I thought I’d be on a movie set when I answered the want ad for a grip.
Be thankful you can't see what's happening to me on the other side.
You still can't get over me, can you?
Excuse me mam, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior?
Will you even remember me when you get to the top?
Beware of the people you step on in your climb to the top.
It’s not my ideal job. More of a stepping stone.
This is what I get for having a foot fetish.
Worst...summer...job...ever.
My psychiatrist said this would cure my foot fetish."
I'm Stoned
Are you high or am I stoned?
Don't ever ask about canceling your membership!
I appreciate you asking, but there's really no nice way of doing it.
It's OK, this is actually the best part of my job.  The worst part is what's happening on the other side of the wall.
They said my job would be helping young people get a leg up.
When he said he was a headhunter from REI, I thought he meant figuratively.
Yeah, just climb right over me. Everyone else does.
Whatever they say, don't agree to be on the donor wall.
Well, it’s better than my job at the whack-a-mole booth.
Have you ever felt that people just use you to get ahead?
Do I rappel you that much?
I could really use a hand.
This is my weekend job. I’m a garden gnome Monday through Friday.
My therapist told me to be a little boulder.
This is not what I meant when I told you to get a grip.
It was a Groupon.
I had a birthday party here a week ago. That's the last thing I remember.
Shhh. Witness protection program
Karma’s a bitch: one second I was chanting ‘build that wall’, and the next I was here.
Thank God; the last guy wore cleats.
Well, the pay's not great. But my coworkers are solid.
When I said I’d support the wall, I really didn’t understand what I was getting into.
Just once, I'd like someone to hold me and not let go.
It's really OK to take me for granite.
It was the best I could do with a liberal arts degree.
We always keep one step a head.
Face it. You'll never get over me.
I'm a CIA undercover, ma'am
My advice--read *all* those drug side-effect warnings.
Be nice. You'll meet me again on your way down.
Open mouth; insert foot.
I detest being stepped on but love being held onto for dear life.
Yeah, I'm stoned.
This is not what I meant when I said that I wanted to be supportive!
I'm a metaphor.
Don't worry - a rock feels no pain and an island never cries.
I know I told you I'd be your rock, but this is ridiculous.
No one thinks I'm worth hanging on to.
I just feel stuck.
I'm your moral dilemma.
It gets worse.  On the other side of this wall some kids are playing Pin The Tail On The Donkey.
While you’re here, can I tell you about our timeshare opportunities?
My shrink says I've got to stop letting people step all over me!
It’s part of my MeToo atonement plan
Surprise! Honey, will you marry me?
Go ahead, step on me. It
won't be the first time.
It's still better than my old Whitehouse gig.
It was either this or move back in with my parents.
LIMERICK: A shy little handhold named Bauer...Sometimes came across rather sour...Though covered in chalk...He really wanted to talk...But alas, he was just a wallflower.
The wall of shame policy of this gym is quite strict.
All I did was tell him that his plan to build a WALL was an          incredibly stupid idea.
It was the only job I could get after leaving the White House.
I'm sick and tired of being taken for granite.
Do I rappel you?
Could I be so bold as to suggest an alternative route?
Tell Vinnie I'll have the money by Friday.
My last climber said I wasn’t supportive enough.
Lisa rethinks her climbing aspirations as she finds herself caught between a rock and a hard face.
You can climb all you want. I still make 17% more than you do.
I’m a stopping stone.
Sid, ya GOTTA stop stalking me....
And my third wish was that women would climb all over me.
They call me North Face.
I told you I was a rockstar, but I never mentioned music.
Please, don't take me for granite.
Have you heard the word of our lord and savior Jesus Christ?
...but the schedule’s flexible so I can still go out on auditions.
I just want to give you the support you deserve.
Lady, this is the MOMA, not an amusement park.
I didn't know what they meant by "job as a rock star."
Would you do me a favor and scratch my nose?
I really can't complain, the job was advertised as a stepping stone position
They said that I’m dumb as a rock, not that I AM a rock. Don’t they know the difference between simile and metaphor?
My mother thinks you're just a social climber.
Hi, I'm the north face.
I can't shake the feeling that people are only using me to get themselves to the top.
For the love of god, scratch my nose.
You're not supposed to be wearing cleats.
No, YOU need to get a grip!
One of the rocks called in sick.
Careful. I used hair gel this morning.
If you could just scratch my nose on your way up...
Women tend to walk all over me.
A liberal arts degree. Why?
Hey, it's better than my job in the White House...
'"I know this is off the wall, but..."
I hate to ask, but would you mind going around?
You know how you fantasize about something for a long time and then when it happens, it's not that great?
Yes, you've been super supportive, but I'm moving on.
If you think this is weird, you should go next door.
I'm just here for support.
Something far worse is happening behind the wall.
My wife said to use my head and find a job.
My father was a rolling stone.
Oh this isn't so bad compared to the cornhole game on the other side.
Lots have noticed, but you're the first to care.
I told you I'd be with you every step of the way.
Go ahead -- you know you want to.
Hi.  We do Employee of the Month differently here.
The judge had a broad definition of "community service"
Good job!  You made it to the first metaphor.
Let he who is without an in be cast as the first stone.
Hey, it was totally not mentioned in the restraining order.
Your shoe's untied.
Be careful. It's a toupee.
My therapist thinks I need to stick my neck out more.
Yelp said it was a great hole in the wall spot.
Yeah... You don’t look like your Tinder photos either...
English major,...you?
Next thing I knew I was high and stoned!
That’s not exactly a rock you just stepped on!
Here’s a life tip: never tell a genie you wish you were a rock star.
And that's why it's important to carefully consider how you phrase your wish.
Go ahead - step all over me like ever other woman I've known.
Go ahead... my wife does it all the time.
Wait till you climb the other side.
Really, Janet, I’m NOT stalking you!
Go ahead, walk all over me. Everyone else does.
Yes, you are standing on what you think you are standing on.
My therapist says I’m a combination of a social climber and wallflower.
Hoffa?
You know, when I said that I wanted my face on a rock wall, I was thinking more Mt Rushmore.”
I lost a bet after I got stoned.
I thought you loved me, but now I realize I'm just a stepping stone.
Oh, no. Foot in mouth again
Estados Unidos?
'Did you wipe your feet?'
My therapist says I'm an enabler, but I just don't see it.
You get this far and now you decide to quit while you’re a head?
This is my geology internship.
That's right... just step on me to get ahead.  They all do.
In today’s economy, this was the best job for a Geology major.
Rocky?
The fortune read that I would be the new face of indoor rock climbing.
It's weird, but it's still better than online dating.
You seem clingy.
I seem to attract clingy women.
I just feel like I'm caught between a rock and hard place.
All in all, I'm just another face on the wall.
I’d give you a hand, but you passed it a while ago.
If you need a helping hand, it’s 6ft higher.
Oh, this isn't so bad; I started out working in the call center.
Please just don't take me at face value...
I am literally between a rock and a hard place.
She found herself between a rock and a hard face.
Sure, I stepped on many people on my rise to the top — I never imagined karma would be so literal.
I think this relationship is starting off on the wrong foot.
If you think this is bad you should see what's happening on the other side of this wall."
Well, you weren't answering my calls..
I’m just here to tell women what they’re doing wrong.
What did you think I meant by a rock group?
You really need to move on Greg...
But you said you wanted someone who could be your rock!
For the last time, Barney, I'm not interested.
I liked you better when you were just a social climber.
They told me I'd be the face of the company.
They said it was because of my chiseled jawline
It's the only job the headhunter could find for me.
That's my dick.
So, is shaving legs like optional now?
Be nice on the way up: you never know whom you will meet on the way down.
Never fall behind on your membership fees in this place.
The inspirational ad said, "Wanted, a man to help others to new heights"
I didn't realize this is what Trump meant when he said he'd create more jobs
You think it's lonely at the top? It's WAY more lonely half way up!
Apparently , you should tip the guys holding your harness rope.
Free membership isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Because of my chiseled good looks, of course
You're making good time but I'm still a head.
Well, I told him where he could stick his damn Wall. Next thing I knew...."
They told me the only way to get to the top was to use my head.
No, I’m the South Face. You need to go to the opposite wall.
Sometimes you've got to step on a few heads if you want to make it to the top.
When you said you were up to your neck in work, I had no idea.
It beats working in the White House
It was between this and a hard place.
You wouldn't be the first women to step all over me.
This job is just a stepping stone.
It could be worse.  I could be the White House Press Secretary.
Oh, go ahead; everyone else does.
Normally, I put my own foot in my mouth.
I know a shortcut...
Be honest, do you find me rappelling?
This is the worst dating website I’ve ever used.
Can you believe this job requires a master's?
You've never seen a rock face before.
They told me that it would be a step up
Having earlier discounted seeing his likeness burned into her breakfast toast Millie again encounters the face of ... Dwight.
Be careful. That's my penis.
Take my advice, kid: Pay your membership fees on time.
Oh geez, you think this is awkward!  There's a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey game behind me!
Yes, it’s painful, but it beats working for Amazon.
I can't really recommend the discounted membership program.
It's all I could find with my liberal arts degree.
Would it kill you to call your mother?
My wife says I deserve it because I voted for Trump.
Do NOT try to default on your membership contract, trust me.
My punishment was this or the whole boulder-up-the-hill thing.
I was much higher up before the reorganization.
I’m the head manager.
In that moment Jerry realized he didn't think through his proposal idea.
Don't mind me. I'm just filling in."
This is just temporary until the crash dummy job opens up.
I'm actually a poker player by profession. I just come here to work on my stone face.
Hey, it could be worse--just ask your harness.
They said this job would be a stepping stone.
Jenny, you've got to admit--I've taken stalking to a new height.
This can't go on, my husband is beginning to suspect.
My wife said I should be more supportive of women.
I knew you were a social climber.
Just letting you know ... There's a glass ceiling up there
This is the last time I use a headhunter to find a job!
I thought our date went well. Why haven’t you been answering my texts?
The ad said "Rock Star"
If they try to get you to join the co-op, say no.
I am a rock. I am an island.
I dunno, it's still better than my old job in the White House...
Dante forgot to mention what happens to stoners.
Things haven't been great lately, Karen.
Do the math. If this is my face, guess what your right foot is standing on?
Wait until you climb down the other side.
...so he says 'Go on I dare you to stick your head through the hole' and well you know the rest
Well, I can't really complain. In my last incarnation I was a speed bump.
Face it, you don't have many options.
The other side is much worse.
Well, you weren't returning my texts,  so....
I regret majoring in philosophy.
Just be glad you’re not wearing a skirt.
Anyhoo, moral of the story is don't get stoned at work.
When I said I’d support the Wall, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
It's the only job I can get with an art history degree.
That’s OK. In my dream  you’re the tennis ball.
John, how many times have I told you to stop putting yourself between me and my goals?
Help,I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Key Grip sounded like such an important job...
You know what they say . . be careful who you step on on the way up because you may meet them on the way down.
Don't...I'll only let you down.
Oh, It's not so bad. I have no body to go home to anyway.
Moisture cream, please!  Or soon I will look like the others.
I also drive for Uber Eats.
Please be gentle. I have a 5th grade birthday party behind me.
The people you climb over to get to the top will be the same people you pass on the way down.
No matter how high you climb, I'll always be a head.
It's the only job I could find with a geology major.
I strongly recommend not making direct eye contact with the witch at the top.
Did they warn you that I have a screw loose?
I always said you’d drive me up a wall.
Your mom and I talked it over and decided that we’re going to let you do more things on your own.”
My side gig is being a gargoyle on the Chrylser Building.
Would you mind just skipping a head.
It's only temporary, I've auditioned for Mount Rushmore.
The job listing said it would be a foothold position into the industry.
Let's just chalk it up to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Be good to the people you meet on the way up; you’ll meet them again on the way down.
Men are never ready for the next step.
Whatever...get a grip and move on!
Just do it.....
Originally I was a temp - but they liked me.
I just want someone to support me for once.
Finally! Can you please itch my nose?
Yeah, you probably recognize me from Fox News. I’m one of their talking heads.
I'm not mansplaining, I just know more about rock climbing than you.
You're the one who told me told me to use my head and get a job.
One small step for a woman...
It pays for law school, but I’m starting to feel crushed.
I think we need a break. You're just too clingy.
Excuse me,Miss.  Would you mind scratching my nose?
Don’t ever wish to be a fly on the wall.
For the bay area, it's actually quite reasonable.
My parents met at work. Dad was a bricklayer and mom was a brick.
I bet you walked all over your last boyfriend, too.
Jason, I'm impressed but I told you it's over between us.
Facetime
Why Mr. Hoffa!!
All I wanted to do was reset my  Facebook settings."
...has to be metaphor for something," Lizzy thought to herself
No matter where she went Ellie couldn't escape her ex-lover's face.
You always said I was a rock.
One last time. Will you marry me?
Welcome to the final phase of corporate training
Get in on the ground floor, they said.... This job is a real deal stepping stone to the top they said....
I was petrified.
Don't forget to be nice to the people you meet on the way up...
Yeah, my profile picture is a little misleading...
I think of it more as a job than a metaphor.
You're afraid of heights? I'm petrified.
John,
I’d suggest you move on. It’s over.
C’mon Liz, just give me a chance to explain everything!
At first, I was really excited about this internship.
This is the company policy for employees caught using FaceTime at work.
I think Pink Floyd said it best, really.
You said you wanted me to be more invested in your hobbies.
The pay isn't great, but I do have dental.
I took this internship because they said that I'd be using my head.
I’d lend you a hand if I could.
Stay in school, kid.
Jake, you old stoner! I was wondering what became of you!
This is great. My last boyfriend didn't support my hobbies at all.
Why do you keep avoiding me?
Dad, you can't watch me all the time.
Stacy, will you marry me?
You haven't returned my calls...
Stalking you? No, supporting.
Not what I had in mind when they said they'd pay me to let women climb on my face...
They told me this job would be a stepping-stone to higher positions.
Is it too late for me to apologize?
Just another chiseled faced actor with rent to make.
I know, but it's still a step up from working at the White House.
It's better than being at rock bottom.
Can we not go bowling after this?
Had one too many..... got plastered !
The ad said "Gain a foothold in the industry..."
I want you to know I could be your rock.
Pretend you don't see anything. I'm in the Witness Protection Program.
Do you ever get the feeling that people are stepping all over you?
You mind opening your mouth a tiny bit more?
You've never heard of a rock face?
Dad!! All this time you said you worked in geology!
Be careful who you step on on your way to the top.
If the benefits weren’t so great, I’d look for another position.
Could you scratch my nose, please.
I have no body to talk to
It was either this or a hunting lodge.
Damn! I thought female climbers wore skirts.
I know it’s a little off the wall, but you want to hang out later?
I'd prefer you give me a hand.
I’m sick and tired of being taken for granite, Cindy!
Do me a big favor and scratch my nose.
I am a GUY on the wall. NOT a fly on the wall damn it!
I can't keep supporting you like this.
I know, I know.  You never forget a face...
Yeah, I got waitlisted at Mount Rushmore
Mommy and I just want to make sure you don't make any of the mistakes we made.
Head this way
Have you any Grey Poupon?
I angered a very athletic wizard.
You promised me some face time.
Face it honey, I rock.
I’m gneiss so don’t take me for granite.
I was the head trainer until I called our new GM "Sweetie" and told her how good she looked in her yoga pants.
I guess the Buddhists were right about that whole karma gig.
I think they misunderstood when I said I liked elevating those around me.
It's worse for the guys on the other side.
Actually, we met when you were on your way up.
Selfie?
What makes you think I'm stalking you?
The last thing she said before she left me was, 
"Talking to you is like talking to a wall."
You rock!
Then they asked if anyone had a geology degree, and I was stupid enough to raise my hand.
I didn’t think I would have to literally step on someone to get to the top.
just get it over with
So! You finally got a job your qualified for.
Now you see why I haven't answered your texts.
So the judge said, "Jail or volunteer at the Y."
You’ve been ignoring my texts!
I got tired of being a doormat.
Karma's a bitch
I think my husband suspects us.
Yea, the network paid more, but I was just another talking head.
Go ahead, I put my foot in there all the time.
Listen Tina, this is just until I can get back on my feet
No I hate climbing but it's one of the only places you can meet people who aren't always looking at their phone.
I'm more concerned about the archery range next door.
You'll leave me eventually. Everyone always does.
Could you scratch my nose for me?
I have oily skin, just so you know.
The worst thing about it is, I'm just a metaphor.
You're so hard to get hold of.
Go ahead! I’ll try NOT to sneeze this time.
Sometimes your only choice is to step on somebody to get a head.
They call me Cliff.
Well it all started with a rocky childhood...
I am NOT stalking you!
Do you ever feel like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place?
I never thought hiring a head hunter would lead to this.
I got tired of being called a doormat.
Stalking! What gives you that idea Ivy?”
Hi, I'm Cliff, the face of the mountain.
Well, you don’t answer your texts.
I'm here to give you a heads-up.
You're a hard man to reach
If you don't mind scratching my nose.
Oh, hi. I've been trying to get a hold of you.
You don't want to know what the rope's attached to.
Our problem is you're staying stationary and  I'm moving up
Like Trump, I'm looking for another foot to stick in my mouth.
Now will you marry me?
She was caught between a rock and a hard face.
If you have a minute, let me tell you about a really great timeshare.
You should see what climbers on the other side--OUCH!--are grabbing.
Please tell me you're a social climber.
You promised me you wouldn't get stoned anymore.
My genie granted my wish of having women climb on top of me.
Those shorts are not doing you any favors."
I'm really between a rock and a hard place here.
At least it's no longer MY foot in my mouth.
I tried social climbing, but it petrified me.
I was hoping for Mt Rushmore...
Dad, you look stoned!
Just once, I’d like to try putting my own foot in my mouth.
I'm afraid I got in over my head.
Man, if these walls could talk...
Someday I'll find a job where people don't walk all over me.
Fly on the wall.  I said I wanted to be a fly on the wall.
My wife signed me up for this support group.
Ok, I’m sorry. Can I come home?
Just remember... the people you meet on the way up are the same people you meet on the way down
I’m not just your stepping stone
I thought you could use a head start.
I know our relationship is kind of one-sided, but if you move your foot a little to the right I might be able to
perform cunnilingus.
Remember me when you're at the top.
I wouldn't.  It's solid glass up there.
I misinterpreted "stepping stone" when I took this job.
Go on, the glass ceiling is just a step ahead!
Pappa was a rolling stone...mom a stalactite.
Like the others,I too was once a rolling stone.
I find you repelling, not repulsive.
Guess who's holding the other end of the rope
Jane's anxiety had finally come to a head
I have attachment issues.
This room is face climbing.  The room behind me is crack climbing.
How stoned did I get last week?
I feel like you're just using me to get where you want to be.
I am just a stepping stone on the wall of life.
As if walking all over me wasn't enough.
Of course I need you Karen. Without you, I've got no body.
If you tell me "You rock!" I will make you fall.
Would you scratch my nose?
Either I'm stoned, or you're lost.
Don't ask.
Why are you stonewalling me?
I'm training to become White House Press Secretary.
WOW!  You really are between a rock and a hard  place!
Be careful on the rock face.
Well, I did tell you that you drive me up the wall!
The ad said, "Help women get to the top."
You call this "face time".
Once a stoner, always a stoner.
The pie-throwing contest got old
I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.
"It's just that you haven't been answering my texts."
I know I promised I'd be your rock,but this just isn't what I had in mind.
This is the last step of my #MeToo penance
Just tell me it's really over and you'll never see me again.
I gotta get out of customer support!
Your next step is just ahead.
Thanks for the support, step dad.
My name is Wallace, but most people just call me Wally.
Just what gave you the impression I'm following you around?
I know it's a trust exercise Sheila, but maybe we should consider a new relationship counselor.
It could be worse.  The racquetball court is on the other side of this wall.
Never trust a discount magician.
I'm stuck in a holding pattern.
Seriously Lucy, get a grip.
Mount Rushmore was full.
Sorry... I'm the south face.
I noticed you haven’t responded to my tweet.
I can’t speak for you, but I see this job as strictly a stepping stone.
Just precisely how was my last comment 'off the wall'?
Your assistant said this was the only time available.
But you said I need to be more supportive.
A face for radio," they told me. "Well I showed them!
No big story, just underemployed.
Julie I lied, I'm not a personal trainer.
Wasn't quite what you expected when you were told you'd get a head by climbing to the top, eh?
Good jobs are hard to find for us humanities majors.
It’s hard for me to get over you too.
I try to be assertive, but people just step all over me.
Is this what you mean by face time?
There's not much to do, so a read a lot of palms.
Remember the little people on your way up.
Nice legs.
Don't mind me, I'm just on border patrol training.
My father wants me to learn all facets of the business before I take over. Next week I'm a bowling ball.
Well, it's much safer than my last job at the bowling alley.
It's not so bad. Thank God for my foot fetish.
Getting stoned isn't what it used to be.
Just try not to mess up my hair.

I started as a social climber, too, but before I knew it I got sucked in.
I am doing my best to squeeze in a little face time!
I see you're still trying to get over me.
Babe,  I don’t see why your therapist recommended this activity for us.”
The worst part is squeezing your head through the hole.
This side's not as bad as dart range next door.

Yeah , but I get dental !
Marry me, Beth!
It pays well and women seem to love it.
This is nothing. I think my ass is in a bowling alley.
Truthfully, sometimes I  feel stuck, like life is passing me by.
Yes, it hurt coming down as well.
I really wish I could lend you a hand.
Sure.  Since your generation grew up on Ayn Rand you think it's ok to step on anyone to get to the top.
Daaady! You are so overprotective!
Congratulations, you're between a rock and hard face.
My therapist says at least I’m not rock bottom
This was a bad day for me to get stoned...
I thought they meant face time
This isn't the kind of memorial I had in mind
It’s true, I’ve been seeing other people.
When I asked for a head start this is NOT what I meant.
Dad, this checking on me as gone to far.
I couldn't climb all the way up the corporate ladder -- so I quit while I was a head.
Well, you said you wanted to climb a rock face.
It’s better than being the harness.
But what I really want to do is direct.
Step here if you want to get a head.
My boss said he could really use a head like mine in the busienss.
Here I am, yet again, letting you climb all over me!

I used to be a face in a crowd...
Go ahead, I'm used to it.

I hope you'll remember me when you make it to the top.
My psychiatrist says I rappel anyone who gets close to me.
Hi, I'm Timmy. They made ME replace the stone I broke!

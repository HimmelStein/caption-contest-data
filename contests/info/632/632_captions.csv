I got her to open up, but now she's beside herself.
What makes you think the Russians were involved?
They were all in it together.
We gotta get the short one to open up.
We’re pretty sure it was an inside inside inside inside inside job, detective.
I can’t shake the feeling that they all fit together somehow.
I only arrested the one on the left. But when we interrogated her she really opened up.
Well, that would explain just the one set of footprints.
We got a tip from someone on the inside.
I think the small one is hiding something but I can't get her to open up
We're gonna have a hard time proving armed robbery.
Call it a hunch, but I think the little one is at the center of it all.
We've already got Number 1 on 5 counts of harboring Russian fugitives.
As we suspected, they were all in on it.
You were right about starting with the cavity search.
Nesting, yes. Collusion, no.
We couldn't get any more out of them.
It’s hard to imagine a more organized crime family.
I suspect it's an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
The big one's covering for them.
Seriously? Loosen my tie and remove my head?
There were more Russians at that meeting than we thought...
If you ask me, I think they were all in on it together.
That's the brilliance of it. They all come in on a single visa.
Number 6 will talk, she’s too afraid of going back inside.
On the upside, we were able to get all of them in one patrol car.
I said, 'Arrest the Russian hackers', not 'Unnest the Russian stackers'.
We think they had a woman on the inside.
I'm sure the smallest one did it, but the others are all
covering for her.
If they do not fit, we must acquit.
Don’t worry. It’s an open-and-shut case.
We're going to keep trying until we get a boy.
Now you know what’s taking Mueller so long.
It’s a good thing we have someone on the inside.
Nope, no relation. Why do you ask
The little one won't crack. Seems she was in the deepest.
She is full of herself.
The little one has a solid alibi, but the rest are pretty hollow.
We suspect they were all covering up for the little one.
They’ve all cracked but the little one on the end.
Keep in mind: If you choose number one, then they are all guilty by association.
I booked the big one for possession of minors.
Don't you think their alibis all fit together just a bit too damn neatly?
They all fit in the description.
Well, they CLAIM they were all together on the night in question.
I swear there was only one when I brought her in.
Their story stacks up perfectly.
She finally opened up.
There's a good chance the Russians are involved.
I don't know, but I think it was an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
The short one appears to be the brains. The rest all seem hollow.
You wouldn't believe what happened during the cavity search.
He’ll still deny they are Russian insiders.
Personally, I still think they're hiding something.
They're all part of something bigger.
Just wait until their lawyers wobble in.
The big one covers for the others.
The little one's our only solid suspect, but I don't think we'll be getting anything out of her.
They all seem to have something to hide.
Good news: the witness positively identified her.  Bad news: the witness wasn't sure about her height.
She just kept repeating herself
No, it’s NOT perspective... It’s OCD !!
They all match the witness's description.
The SAME alibi?  ALL of them?!
It looks like an open and shut and open and shut and open and shut and open and shut and open and shut case.
I've heard they've got people on the inside.
WHAT has gotten into you lately?
Pretty sure it was an inside job.
Wait till you see their lawyers.
The little one might still be hiding something...
The pieces of this case are fitting together nicely.
Turns out it was an inside job.
Looks like an inside inside inside inside inside job.
If this lineup doesn't work, we can bring in the sketch artist.
Wooden dolls fool the TSA  ??
We finally got the big one to open up.
I keep telling you, it was an inside job.
I can’t get the last one to crack.
I should probably recuse myself.
I guess at this point we hope he remembers how tall she was.
Odds are good it was an inside job.
I can't get anything more out of them.
I can’t help thinking they all fit together somehow.
Think we'd better hand this one over to internal affairs.
It appears that we have uncovered a nest of Russian spies.
It's a real open-shut, open-shut, open-shut, open-shut, open-shut case.
I think the smallest one is still hiding something.
I know one of them is guilty, but how do the others fit into this?
Trust me, they were all in on it.
... and you are hoping the Blue Fairy can make them alive ??
What makes you think Russia is behind this?
I've heard six different stories, each shorter than the last.
It's an inside-inside-inside-inside-inside job.
What makes you think I'm the father?
They were arrested for unlawful assembly.
It’s believed that the victim was shot six times- each time with a smaller gun.
I think we might be looking at an inside inside inside inside inside job.
Third from the left, I'm positive. I'll never forget that face as long as I live.
I think the one on the left is covering for the others.
You wouldn't think it, but they're arms smugglers.
The more I look into it, the more suspects I find.
If you ask me, I think the little one is hiding something.
Fortunately, they were all unarmed.
They're covering for each other.
I think they were all in on it.
I suppose you're from Internal Affairs??
They just lined up as if they’ve done this before...
We think it was the little one. The others were just covering for her.
I know this is going to sound racist, but they all look alike to me.
They said we were looking for embedded Russians.
Their alibis all stack up...
I call every one "Doll."  I mean no disrespect.
We're letting the big one go.  We think it was an inside job.
The president denies knowing any of these dolls.
Don't worry, she's not gonna walk.
During interrogation she really opened up.
There's a lot to unpack here.
All I know so far is all but the little one were hiding something.
I really underestimated how much she had going on inside.
All of these suspects fit the profile.
Weird.  There was just one up there a minute ago.
I know the type-- you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.
They told us to find embedded Russians.
Looks like it was an inside job.
This case is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, nested into about three more similar-type things.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe we all look alike to them?
Their stories? Every one rings hollow--only the youngest is solid.
#1? Why, because she has the most to hide?
They've all got airtight alibis: each one can account for the whereabouts of all the others!
They say they were all together on the day of the crime."
We've run into a problem....no one can identify any distinquishing feature.
All I said to Suspect #1 was "What are you hiding?"
Maybe they're all in it together.
Oh come on, I have limbs!
This is what you get with no swimsuit competition.
I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
The suspect brought her own lineup and I just went with it.
I don't know how, Chief, but somehow it all fits together.
It fits.
We've finally cracked open a Russian crime family.
Saying she’s stacked IS NOT a double entendre!
Two more woodenhead and I 'll have enough for a baseball bat.
I feel like a fat man with five other fat men struggling to get out.
Collins, you're an idiot if you can't see they're all in on it.
I’m still putting the pieces together but it appears to be an inside job.
The rightmost one is the main suspect, but the district attorney wants to charge the rest of them with harboring a fugitive.
Even worse, Sarge - no fingerprints.
I think the big one is covering for the others.
We tried, but the last one jsut won't crack!
I can’t help feeling that they’re hiding something.
No telling how deep this thing goes...
Somehow I think the Russians are behind this.
This is why we do cavity searches, Nancy
Let's start by charging Number 1 with harboring a fugitive.
I know it doesn't make sense Chief, but I think they were ALL driving the getaway car.
Yeah, we just kept telling ourselves “the next one has to be a boy!”
I'm telling you, we're not gonna get anything else out of her.
The first five opened right up, but 
 the smallest one wouldn't crack.
Call it a hunch, but I think it was an inside job.
We keep trying till we have a son!
What? They all matched the description.
I think the big ones are covering for the little ones.
Witnesses only remember the tall one.
Well detective, I think this case is open and shut and open and shut and open and shut, and open and shut...
You’re the one who said the suspect was unarmed.
We think one of these suspects was working from the inside.
I thought it was bring your kids to work day.
No, sorry. The one I saw was a little taller.
What makes you think there is collusion?
I don't know, Chief, this whole case fits together just a little too neatly.
I guess fingerprints are out of the question.
We've identified the big babushka on the left as the leader of an elaborate shell game.
I didn't think she had it in her.
We've got our girl. Third from the right, Rosy Cheekless.
It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
The accuser is saying its an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
Their alibis are a little wobbly
Yes, it's bring your daughters to work day.
I picked her up in Russia, I had no idea she was smuggling her family in with her.
They were brought in by those two detectives from TV, 
Tchotchke and Hutch
They all look guilty, but some to a lesser degree.
It’s a matter of perspective. The witness isn’t sure if the perp was very small and close, or just bigger and further away.
Apparently, there were voices inside her telling her to do it.
What do you mean - are there any distinguishing features?
I can't do this. They all look just like Mom.
I know you said don't use the word 'doll' when addressing a woman, but...
Everything is in order, comrade.
Don't look at me like that, Linda. You know I've got a type.
This case is open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, open and shut . . . .
Hey listen, those sperm donations got me through college.
It was the one inside the one inside the second one from the left.
This case is a mystery, inside a riddle, inside an enigma, inside a ...
We've had an informant on the inside for sometime now.
My suspicion is that they're all in this together.
We’re starting to suspect it was an inside job
I have to recuse myself.
It's part of the Russia investigation.
Well, the witness said she was Russian and stacked...
I swear, every time I think this Russia Investigation is about to end...
I swear, there was only one when i turned around.
Gary, a woman has been strangled to death, and you bring me the only six women in this entire town who don't have any arms?
This is what happens with chain migration.
We're out of suspects. Nobody else will open up.
Alibis? Look at them! They don't have a leg to stand on.
We could try to get them to open up, but I think we already know what we'll find.
NO, you may not twist my head off.
Looks like they were all in on it
Innocent? No, they're all in it together.
How many more times are we going to reopen this case?
We know five of them have been inside.
I thought we had one suspect until we looked into it further.
The witness stated that the assailant was female, of average height, and unarmed.
What do you mean, "They all look alike?"
So you think it's an inside,inside, inside, inside, inside job?
This definitely looks like it was an inside job.
I'm starting to think this may have been an inside job
You try putting together a lineup on such short notice!
Sorry, Captain, I can’t get the little one to crack.
This is clearly a job for Internal Affairs.
|“It’s no use; they’re just covering for each other.”
What makes you think I'm the father, Svetlana?
They all have the same alibi. At the time of the murder, they were on a shelf at the airport gift shop.
Can you have them turn around?
No wonder the Russian Investigation is taking so long.
Oh come on, you have to admit the resemblance is striking!
I swear I only brought one in.
They'll wibble and wobble, but they won't flip on each other.
Looks like another inside job.
Can you put red dots on number three’s cheeks before the witness arrives?
This is a waste of time. There’s no way any of them are pickpockets.
I swear, none of them are mine.
So she says to me, “Mostly they all look like you, Detective Podorevskaya”.
It all fits a little too neatly.
I have a feeling they're all in it together.
Congratulations Murphy, I think you finally cracked the case of the E Pluribus Unum Gang.
Number four has an alibi. She was getting tattoos removed from her cheeks.
Word on the street is that this was an inside job.
We think it's a pyramid scheme.
It’s definitely organized crime. 
Very, very organized crime.
Every time I think I've solved it, another suspect pops up.
We were trying for a boy.
You won't believe where the littlest one was hiding.
We've done all we can... Internal Affairs will handle them from here.
They all say it was an inside job inside a job inside a job inside a job inside a job inside a job.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm the dad.
I can't shake this feeling that they were all working together.
It was an open and open and open and open and open and shut case.
I don't know.  They all just seem to fit together.
It all fits!
This case fits together neatly. A little too neatly.
She’s actually my first cousin, five times removed.
They have alibis, but they're not airtight.
It's simple.  After six wooden girls, Gepetto wanted a real, live, talking boy.
Obviously, an inside job.
I dunno...They all look like my sister...
I swear! I’ve never seen them before in my wife!
I don't know, she just kept opening up!
I don't know how they all fit in that phone booth.
Just what we need, another Russia investigation.
Their story does fit together.
I feel like They’re all hiding something, except for the little one.
We can't get the little one to crack.
I've got five of them in the lineup to flip on the big one. They have a lot of insider information.
So what happens when we ask one to step forward?
If you ask me, they're in this together.
Tell Mr. Mueller he's getting closer."
You need to stop painting your name on the floor, Lars!
All signs point to Russia
Yes, at a low moment I donated to a sperm bank.
I think they're all covering for the little one on the end.
Maybe it’s just me, but deep down, I just know this whole thing fits together perfectly.
Just because you have a neck doesn't mean you can come in here and boss me around.
Do not be deceived - they are experts at multilayer encryption
I still think they're hiding something.
All six confessed it was an inside job.
It's number 3! No way I'd forget that face.
We found the first suspect, and then the rest came forward one after another.
I can get more if the smallest one decides to open up.
I thought I told you, no profiling.
Call it a hunch, but the little cop in my gut tells me they're still hiding something.
It has all the markings of a copycat crime.
This is a perfect example of chain migration.
Except for the big one, they each claim they were ''in" at the time.
Conflict of interest? What conflict of interest?
Kim, Kylie, Kourtney, Khloé, Kendall, Kris - they're all the same to me.
I tried to get her to open up, but now she's beside herself.
Looks like a classic inside inside inside inside inside job.
They're not armed, but don't let that fool you. They're part of a tightly knit hierarchical organization.
We think it must have been an inside job.
Y'know, it is possible they were all there.
This looks like an inside job
They are all covering for each other.
All he said was, 'The perp was a real Russian doll'.
It was a classic case of chain migration.
All we know so far is it was an inside job.
We really need to start using a different sketch artist.
Maybe it's me, but they all look the same!
I wish ICE would leave us out of these chain migration cases.
You were right, size matters.
Those girls don”t have a leg to stand on.
Seems to have been an inside job.
I'm starting to think it was an inside inside inside inside job.
I suspect they were all in it together.
So only one of them has a green card?
I love Bring Your Family to Work day!
The witness only saw her from a distance,so we're in real trouble.
Turns out more than one person fit the description.
It shouldn't take long to put this one together.
I knew the Russians were hiding something.
Looks like six degrees of separation again.
A classic case of chain immigration.
I have a hunch this was an inside job.
Odds are, it's an inside job.
It all fits together now.
I know how crazy this sounds, but I think they may have ALL been there.
I’ve got a feeling the Russians are behind this one.
Getting them to open up was easy.  Their so full of themselves.
I'm getting a feeling this was an inside job.
Honest, I did not separate this family at the border.
Only one I'd trust is the little one. The rest look like they've got something to hide.
I'd  like six coffees please -- one trenta, venti, grande, tall, regular, and small.
It could be Russia.  And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey...
All but one claim it was an inside job.
Looks like it was an inside inside inside inside inside job.
I’m gonna sit this one out, I think it’s a conflict of interest.
I get the feeling one of them may still be hiding something.
What makes you think I'm hiding something?
We have the evidence. Now we need to put it all together.
I knew that first one was hiding something.
I'm starting to think they were in it together.
She’s my sisters
Yep. I used to be #7.
It's the smallest one—the others are all covering for her.
Then BAM! All of a sudden, I was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a great grandfather, a ....
I swear Barb, after a while, they all start to look the same.
I guess the paternity tests results came back
The cameras only show the big one going in. Could it be an inside job?
They've all really spilled their guts except the last one.  She's harder to crack.
Even after all that mandatory diversity training, I still think they all look alike.
I'm sure it has something to do with the Russians, but I can't quite fit it all together.
Our chances of finding ‘em just keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
President Trump ordered us to use the Russian way of keeping families from being separated at the border.
Well, obviously it was an inside job.
What do you mean, 'somebody on the inside?'
And each one has hundreds of social media accounts.
Go ahead, twist my head. I dare you.
Previously on Tchotchke and Hutch...
They’re beside themselves.
I don't see how this is profiling.
This case is a puzzle inside a riddle inside an enigma inside a Weeble.
No, these are different from the blow-up ones.
I’ve taken their statements. The little one is solid but the rest ring hollow.
Their stories don't quite fit.
I'll take the fifth.
We have a positive ID on the third from the left. No, second from right. No, wait...
Looks like an inside job.
Under interrogation, they gave each other up.
I’m telling you right now, the last one won’t crack.
It's the one on the left.  She spilled her guts.
Do you think it's Russian meddling?
We were happy until she accused me of looking at her sisters.
This downsizing is freaking me out."
I think we’re dealing with another copycat crime.
Hear me out. Have you tried opening Paul Manafort up?
I'm telling you boss, it was an inside job
Well, we had it narrowed down to one suspect, but she just kept opening up.
I, too, have layers within.
We believe they’re part of a larger organization
In this case, the only thing that does matter is “size”.
I know,we aren't supposed to say they all look alike
I know they're in it together.
They say they only talked about adoptions.
Is fingerprinting off the table?
Ah, the Matryoshka crime family. Don't be fooled by their smiles. They are hollow on the inside.
We'll bring the witnesses in and see how they stack up.
We've got em' all on multiple counts of Nesting with Russians.  But was there Collusion?
My gut tells me it's an inside job.
"I'm pretty sure you'd only be able to prosecute the one on the right, anyway. The others all told me they heard voices inside.
You know the paternity evidence is stacked against you.
Their alibis just don’t stack up.
They say they've got nothing left to hide.
I caught the big one trying to sneak the others into the country.
I got a funny feeling this was an inside job
Yeah, we thought this was an open and shut case...to find out it was an open and open and open and open and open and open case!
I think it was an inside inside inside inside inside job.
This is what happens when you skimp on sketch artists.
I nest my case.
I think the little one is hiding something.
I think it is an inside job.
The pieces in this Russia case are starting to fit together
Their alibis check out...same place at the same time.
We picked them up near FAO Schwartz.
We can release suspect number six. She wasn't hiding anything.
I'm pretty sure they're all in on it. I just can't figure out where they hid the body.
I can't be sure. Would you ask them to turn sideways?
I have a hunch they may be working together.
You know Sarge, I just can't shake the idea that all of these players fit together somehow.
I can’t shake the feeling that this is an inside job.
I don’t know, they all seem to have something to hide.
We have reason to believe they are working together.
It’s clearly an inside, inside, inside job.
It’s hard to tell. They were all nesting at the time.
Six counts of collusion - they’re stacking up!
We know what she looks like, we just don't know how tall.
Not only do the suspects fit the description, they also fit in the suspects.
We're starting to suspect this was an inside job.
This Russian interference goes deeper than I thought.
I don't know, something tells me they were in it together.
Well, your people all look the same to me as well.
You'll never get the little one to crack.
Their names are Donald, Melania, Ivanka, Jared, Donald Junior, and Eric, and yes of course they are for sale
We found the others lingering inside.
I tell ya, Janice, the more we keep digging into this "Russia thing"...
She's a repeat offender
Cloning yes, collusion no.
If you ask me, they were all in on it.
uh...rosy cheeks, babushka and Mona Lisa smile...that's all I remember
We're onto something, all the pieces are starting to fit together.
Wow! You've got a lovely neck.
They claim they were never in the same hotel room as the President.
Inside job" doesn't even begin to describe it
They say they were just talking about adoption.
The Russian's want Ivanka to market them as the new Barbie"..
How often did you donate your sperm?
Only one passport, but they’re all registered to vote.
I didn't realize the full scope of Russian interference in our line up.
When we checked the CCTV tape we observed that only one of 'em entered the bank, but  all six exited ten minutes later.
She was smaller.
They all opened up except for the little one, she just would not crack.
I know how they work and trust me, it all fits. This case is open and open and open and open and open and shut, shut, shut, shut, shut.
Most of them are cooperating. I just can't seem to get the little one to crack.
I hate russian dolls....they're so full of themselves.
Ah yes, now I see how it all fits together.
It's only fitting -- they all did it.
And I thought this was going to be an open and shut; open and shut; open and shut; open and shut; open and shut; and, open and shut case.
One of them is linked to a series of inside jobs
You know what this means don’t you—it was an inside job.
No confessions here . . . they’re all so full of themselves!
We just blew this case wide open.
We gathered everyone who matched the description you gave us, but we need you to be a bit more specific
Don't tell me size doesn't matter.
It’s Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.
Sorry, you just don't fit in!
Without fingerprints, how do you prove it?
The short one seems solid.
Who the hell wrote 'Lars' on our floor in permanent ink?
Smuggling, for sure, but damned if I can figure out which one of them to charge.
Maybe we have gone too far with profiling.
Well, this is just the first suspect.
Only the little one has a solid alibi.
I am pretty sure it was an inside job.
I was the only boy of the septuplets
This has been the most excruciating cavity search of my career
I just can't see any one of them being armed and dangerous...
Does this job ever make you feel... empty inside?
I swear they all just wanted to talk about adoptions.
It’s the one without the dimples.
Cool it Marge, it's not sexist if they're actually dolls!
I think Number Six is still hiding something.
She ran out saying she couldn't contain herself.
...and they're all programmed to vote.
They all match the description.
It looks like they were all in it together.
My gut says they were all in on it.
Let's just hope that the witness is better remembering heights rather than faces.
The evidence is starting to stack up.
You try getting one of them to open up.
Am I racist, or do they all look the same?
We're operating under the theory that it was an inside job.
Yeah, height and weight ain’t good, but they all fit the description.
I don't get it. The witness said she looked like the one on the right from a distance, but the one on the left close up.
I think the smallest one is hiding something.
We’ve been through this, Frank. They are not Pussy Riot!
Well, I'm convinced it was an inside job.
Looks like she's finally starting to open up, chief.
We've got one who was working from the outside — basic reconnaissance — the rest were definitely in on it, but the short one, she won't crack.
Witnesses say one of them was at the Trump Tower meeting.
No question in my mind. It was an inside job.
I think it may have been an inside job.
I think it was an inside,inside,inside,inside,inside job.
They fit the profile.
Search the smallest one again. I think she's hiding something.
In a case like this, perspective matters.
All except the tall one were working undercover.
Vice picked them up on a nesting charge.
I've heard of stacking the jury...but now we're nesting the suspects?
We figured out how the Russians managed to get so many spies into the country.
Looks like an open and shut, open and shut, open and shut case.
When seen from left to right, it's titled "INPUTS";
when seen from right to left, it's called "PUTINS".
I didn't ask her to take her top off I swear
The one on the end is hiding something.
If one did it, they all did it.
I think her story is beginning to unravel.
Chief said he has an idea about fixing overcrowded jails.
I swear, there was only one here before I left!
That's the last time they try and sneak through on one passport.
Trust me when I say our pool of suspects keeps getting smaller and smaller
Looks like an open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, open and shut case.
No one is above the law of diminishing returns.
How can you accuse me of ethnic profiling?
Oh, you're here for the Russian trolls- those are up on the fourth floor.
She was so full of herself!
They're quite full of themselves.
It's definitely an inside job but none of them will talk.
Sadly, we are divorced now - she was so full of herself.
Now I'm sure the clues all fit together!
After reviewing this lineup I'd say it all fits together
Anyway you stack em one looks as guilty as the next!
I don’t like the way this case is stacking up.
We think it was an inside, inside, inside job.
Mahoney, I gotta hunch this was an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
The sketch wasn't drawn to scale, of course, which is the first problem.
It couldn't be number three.  She was in number four at the time.
We have reason to believe the one at the end is harboring other fugitives.
Let's just wait and see how they stack up.
Next you do the body cavity search.
The one on the right refuses to open up.
We got them on smuggling. As for how many counts, you got me.
The line-up? It's nothing compared to the cavity search.
It's this whole 'Russian' thing.
All of them say they were together at the time of the crime.
It's an open-and-open-and-open-and-shut case.
They said I never really fit in.
It was clearly an insider job.
When the chief said to round up all of Aleksei's Russian dolls, I 'm pretty sure these aren't the ones he was talking about.
They're all in on it.
I just have a feeling it was someone on the inside—but who?
I'm starting to think it was an inside job too.
Can I see 5 inside of 2?
It wasn't easy but I think we got 'em all.
If you ask me, the short one's at the center of the plot.
Every time I get inside one of their heads, we find a new suspect.
What do we do now? Number 4 wiped off her blush.
Hillary's emails are in the little one.
Yes I lined up my matryoshka dolls along the suspect wall again and yes I know I was told not to do this.
It all stacks up.
The genius of it is if we nab one of them--we get them all.
Spatial profiling
Well the witness did say the suspect was between 2ft and 5ft tall.
Bad news: the one on the left has an alibi.
Every time we think we have our suspect, another one appears.
I own the company, but I'm more of a figurehead.
I said "arresting molls" not "nesting dolls."
What makes you think they worked together?
Their alibis are suspiciously similar.
They're starting to all look the same,aren't they...
I swear, all I said to Janet was 'There's a better you inside of you, and we both know it.'
I swear I just brought in the one.
What? It's "Take Your Daughters To Work" day...
They thought they could get away with it, but they're all just so full of themselves.
It's the worst case of stolen identity I've ever seen.
Whadayamean, they all look the same to you?
Listen, you try nesting them without being accused of inappropriate touching!
Their stories are pretty consistent, almost like they witnessed it from the same vantage point.
We think the smallest one did the robbery. We brought in the rest for harboring a fugitive.
No, I'm an empty nester.
Well, yes. Technically they ARE "Russian" nesting dolls, but they were made in Taiwan, so I didn't think they'd be a security issue.
Every time I think I know who did it, another culprit comes out of the woodwork.
Nesting is the same as colluding.
Well they all have your neckline Phil...
Upon first impression, the suspect is very full of herself
Ok so maybe it was an inside job after all.
The theory is they were all in it together
Take my head off - see for yourself.
20 years on the force and this one really shook me up...I just didn't think she had it in her.
I'd bet my badge the smallest one is at the centre of all this.
I only reported one doll to customs, I swear I didn’t know about the others
From the looks of it, I would say that it must have been an inside job.
Just coincidence.  No collusion.
I thought you said it was an "Open and Shut" case.
The notorious babushka gang, Got 'em dead to rights.
Beth, I just can't handle these serial cases anymore.
They insist on being deported as One.
So, you're still telling me it wasn't the Russians?
Fuggedaboutit, Chief, they're all covering for each other.
Comrade, do you think one of them could be hiding something?
But how did they get up the stairs?
Is it racist if I say they all look alike?
Maybe if we rearrange them?
What makes you think I put my sisters in the line-up?
Chain Migration?  What are you saying?
I dunno Sandra... number 3 says she's here to discuss adoption. That's some pretty wholesome stuff right there.
"I thought you were over Russian dolls, Jerry."

-Alexys Mason (age 13, Baldwin Middle School)
Turns out they were all in on it.
Nested, then arrested!
One of them will crack.
They must have had someone on the inside.
Exactly where do you see yourself fitting in?
We may have more suspects.
I think we need to ask all of them about their interior motives.
They all work at The Onion, create fake news, hold stock in a shell corporation, and are part of a pyramid scheme, and five of them have been in hiding.
What do you mean they all look the same?
The first one cracked and the others followed.
The wooden expressions are throwing me off.
Fine - you pick her out of the lineup then
That littlest one is close to cracking, I can just feel it.
It couldn’t have been her. She was on the inside when it happened.
I don't want to be that person, but they all look alike.
It was supposed to be a line up of Russian trolls!
Sorry, this is a Trump 2020 campaign meeting. Lineups are down the hall.
I tell you, this perp is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
They're really full of themselves, huh?
Look, just nest them, and save ICE some money by deporting only the big one.
Nice lineup. But the suspect is a Barbie Doll.
Russian collusion? No, inclusion.
Without a doubt it was an inside job.
All the witnesses agree:  they colluded.
Are you sure they are Russian?
Now, don't be rushin' to any conclusions. What makes you think they're all in this together?
I' think I know how we can save some shelf space, Olga.
Listen, I'm not the one who's full of myself okay?
What makes you think its a gang thing?
We think it was someone on the inside.
The name's Nest. Eliot Nest.
It's an open and shut case.
I can't believe you think I'm hiding something.
I didn't know I would need a visa for each of them!
It's how they smuggle lobbyists past our facial recognition security.
At last. Proof of the Russian conspiracy to conceal a puppet leader.
Well Ma'am, at least this spy ring gets smaller and smaller.
I can’t explain it!  There was only one the last time I  looked.
Thanks!  You are a doll.
Well, you might not think your neck is freakish, but I'm telling you, you're the only one that has one.
I just don't understand it,They sat in the cabinet for years,and now this!
The vic says it coulda been all of 'em, for all she knows.
Russia's #Me Too moment
I call it the "Me Too" doll.
I just need some perspective.
Did you have to put my whole family through the line up?
My instinct tells me the short one on the end is at the center of this whole thing.
I don’t know about this larsony, Hal, but now I do know how the Russians got inside our polling booths.
What's wrong? You said the suspect would be wearing a babushka.
Come on, Jeff, save the Russian toys for the White House.
Detective work is never a one-size-fits-all proposition, Sarge.
Would you be a doll and help stack them back up?
I have it cranked down to near freezing in there Sue and not a hint of rosy cheeks on number 4. I’d say we found our Matryoshka.
What? I told you it was an open-and-shut case.
Can you go in and turn them to the left?
Inside job, eh?
They'll talk if they can go into hiding afterwards.
They inherited their neck from me.
We got her to open up.
Meet the Doppler sisters
I can't get the littlest one to crack.
Sadly it's my wife.  I didn't know she had it in her.
Ok, you can bring in Mueller now.
Doesn't the fourth one from the left look a bit shifty to you?
I thought it would be an open and shut case. But it's been open, open, open, open, open...
All in all, they were in this together!
You’re right Sarge, it was an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
I don't care what 23 'n' Me says, I'm not related to any of 'em.
Looks like a quintessential inside job to me.
That moustache isn't fooling anyone, Tony, we know you're the inside woman.
Is it just me or is she full of herself?
I'm sure it was an inside job.
All I said was, 'These gals sure are stacked.'"
When she said “I have a secret inside me” I thought she was referring to the robbery.
We think it might be an inside job
I thought we agreed that six children would be it.
This Russian case is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. But where do these nested dolls come in?
They aren't mine.
I don't get it.  Each one tells the same story, but in smaller and smaller font.
In this case, identifying the perp's exact height is extremely important.
I don't know, Sue. The evidence stacks up too  perfectly.
Russian interference with the facial recognition software again.
If your witness picks the big one we've got them all.
How do you expect me to book them - they don't have fingerprints!
Well, you did say you could pick her out of a lineup.
Our sketch artist just quit.
Something tells me it was an inside job.
Witnesses say they were all in it together.
I’m starting to think this was an inside job.
Something just doesn't fit here.
I think we’re looking at an inside, inside, inside job.
Tell Mueller, the Russia investigation just got a whole lot more complicated!"
There are more layers to this case than we initially realized.
When I said I wanted 6 Russian suspects by Friday, this is not what I meant...
When I began the interrogation, they all just started opening up....
Can you give me more than just 'the suspect seemed really full of herself'?
My intuition tells me that the shortest one is still hiding something.
It’s, “Bring your family to work” day.
Ethnic profiling and sexism, maybe. But don’t accuse me of size-ism.”
So the Russia probe has come down to this?
Just nesting ... I mean resting.
We shouldn't separate the mother from her children."
When you witnessed the crime how far away were you?
Yes, we have that same egg-shaped-head, but there's no relation.
They entered illegally, but I can't bring myself to separate them.
Apparently the suspect had multiple people on the inside.
Now that you've seen the line-up, would you still say my description is "xenophobic and sexist?"
They all matched the DNA sample.
Six of one and a half dozen or the other.
At first glance, I wouldn't of thought she had it in her
Things just don't stack up.
She did have a very clever scheme for getting them all into this country.
It's the old Russian dolls, all six travel on one airplane ticket scheme.
How many Russian dolls does anybody need?
Something about this just doesn't stack up.
We’ve lost track of which one we suspect.
Getting them to turn to the side is a challenge.
I know one was taller than the other
They all say it was an inside job.
Don’t worry, we had a guy on the inside.
We separated them at the border.
I'm not sure I fit in.
It appears to have been an inside job, likely the Russians.
The shortest suspect on the end is the most suspicious.  I can't seem to get inside of her head.
We uncovered a nest of Russian hackers.
I think we‘ve reached a dead end with the little one
You got me. It's a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in an enigma...
Don't you think we should add some diversity to this line-up?
The big one says they were all in it together.
They have nothing left to hide.
You oughta see my little brother!
No, I don't. But maybe I think all YOU people look alike.
My wife left me,and took our five kids.
It's more of a perp wobble...
Get Special Prosecutor Mueller on the line.  Tell him we have a positive ID on a nest of Russian election hackers.
It was an inside job.
They all have something to hide.
Clearly, it was inside job.
If you ask me, looks like an inside job.
I think one of them is hiding something.
Bring in the witness -- all six of them.
I'd bet my pension the Russians are behind this.
I think they're in on it together
The big one's covering for the others.
My instincts say inside job.
You gotta admit, they all fit the description . . .
Its a riddle wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. Still working on the other three
So probably the most important thing we look for in new recruits around here is, you know, fit.
The charge? Cannibalism.
The witness says they were all in on it.
It's so hard to get a positive ID in these insider trading cases.
They're saying it was an inside job
How is that racist? Look at them!
You don't want to know what we found in the little one.
Don't ask me how I know, but the little one is hiding something.
I feel like this job has made me more well rounded.
I just don’t think you’ll fit in
I've got a source on the inside.
Seems they all fit the same mold!
It shouldn’t be too hard to get them to open up.
Seems like an inside job to me.
Don’t worry. If my DNA matches I’ll recuse myself.
Meet Guilty, Uilty, Ilty, Lty, Ty, and Y.
Why do you think I’m hiding something?
We need to get inside their heads.
These aren't the Russian trolls we're looking for.
I think they're all covering for each other.
Once I got the first one to open up to me, it was easy.
Obviously all Russian hackers but I’d say Putin’s babushka is the one without the rosy cheek dots.
It’s the clearest case of conspiracy I’ve ever seen.
It’s always the little cute one that won’t break.
We may have uncovered a nesting of spies.
It's obvious! They're part of a pyramid scheme. I had nothing to do with it. No collusion! Why don't you just build a wall so I can sit on it and get back to my personification of being a good egg?!
Sorry officer, they all look the same to me.
The evidence against Russia is stacking-up.
Don’t mean to objectify them detective, but these dolls are STACKED!
I don't know what it is about this about this case, Phil, but no matter how close I look, I just keep seeing more of the same.
Were they all at that Trump Tower meeting? I only saw one.
We think they all belong to the same gang.
Looks like an inside-inside-inside job.
'Are they getting smaller or are they further away?'
I think they're related.
Looks like some potential meddling by you-know-who.
Don’t make me repeat myself.
I bet they'll try to stack the jury
Primo job on the cavity search, dollface.
They all have their alibis except for the big one.
We need to learn how high up the Russian collusion went.
The evidence points to an inside job.
How did you know I was Russian?
In a case like this, size does matter!
We  think the tall one was the mastermind but, obviously, we couldn't arrest one without arresting them all.
Collusion’
I still feel like they're hiding something.
It's always an inside job.
I really couldn't say. At a distance they all look the same.
Their mother is kinda OCD.
Sometimes I feel so hollow inside
No offense, comrade, when I said they were stacked.
Frankly, I'm not seeing the Russian connection here, Lieutenant. No collusion!
Whaddaya think, inside job?"
Thanks. You're a doll !
Seems to me it was an inside inside inside inside inside job.
This is my extended family.
Sometimes, I don't know what's got into me.
Define 'medium height'
I think the big one's hiding something.
I know they’re nesting, but are they colluding?
You're telling me they were all in it together?
She really opened up after that last interrogation.
You'd never guess that, deep down, one of them is a killer.
Really?  You think they look alike?
I thought you said size doesn’t matter.
Given a solid profile on the suspect, Det. Smirnov suddenly realizes it was an inside job.
I think we're looking at a repeat offender.
If you stand at the other end and look this way, they all look the same height.
It wasn’t until  the autopsy we realized he was a serial killer...
They were trying to smuggle each other into the Country.
They all have the same alibi.
But you said the perpetrator had a woman on the inside!
At least we only need one jail cell.
We believe the little one on the right was the most deeply embedded.
they really wanted a boy .
Having children gives me a sense of perspective.
Size matters.
These dolls won't talk -- but all the pieces fit.
I say we call Mueller's office and tell him we have some insiders.
Sharon, I don’t care if they’re Russian. The policy is: if they’re family, they must be kept separated.
They've been covering for each other since they came over from Russia.
At first I thought it was #1, but something in me says #6
How do I know you're YOU?
Witness says it's #3, but I  think the little one's still hiding something.
Fire the sketch artist.
It looks like this was an inside job.
Some perspective might help.
You said you wanted fillers in the lineup.
They’re covering for the smaller one.
I picked up the suspect and discovered so much more inside.
The suspects seem fairly full of themselves.
What do you mean, 'an inside job'?
I got a feeling the little one is hiding something.
I told you, I have somebody on the inside.
There’s just no telling how deep this goes...
We need just one that talks
Something tells me they were all in this together!
If you ask me, the one on the left is covering for the others.
The little men inside me say it's an inside job.
There's more; get number six to open up.
They were all in on it, trust me. It was all an inside job.
Their alibis fit together perfectly .
I'm sorry, but they all look alike
…Now I’ve got the witness telling me they were ALL at the scene.
Look at it this way, at least YOU are not beside yourself
You said the suspect wasn't armed, so what's the problem?
If you ask me, I think they were set up.
I come from a big family that keeps a lot of things on the inside.
Yes, it is a riddle of sorts. Wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
I told you I'm sterile, there is no way I am the father.
All their alibis are hollow. They're all hiding something.
I thought you said we only had one suspect?
It was a mistake.  I thought it was a Russian dating service.
If you ask me, they all look guilty.
You wouldn’t believe the things the littlest one has seen
Just got an order from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for 3 Russian dolls.. I am thinking it is a misunderstanding..
if the dolls fit, you must acquit
They were all covering for each other until we separated them.
I don’t buy their story, the pieces fit together a little TOO well...
They're all in it together, I just don't know how they fit together.
We can rule out the little one. But the rest, they all have something to hide.
I think they're covering up for each other.
Any experience supervising tchotchkes?
I’ve been interrogating them for hours but they’re just so full of themselves.
It's an inside inside inside inside inside job.
I think I would be a good fit here.
Although #3 had a beef with the victim, the evidence isn't strogonoff to make an arrest.
I think the one on the right is hiding something.
I'm really struggling to get the little one to open up, Barb.
I don't know, something's just not stacking up.
They're my kids starting with Sarah who is 6.
I don't know, just got a feeling someone is still hiding something here.
поцелуй мою задницу, 'just a routine open-and-shut case'  the Captain said! The damn thing turned into an epic open-and-shut, open-and-shut, open-and-shut, open-and-shut,  open-and-shut, can't open-and-shut case before we finally cracked it!
Yeah, Sarge, I really got the big one to open up.
I'm stumped. The DNA results are all identical.
This thing goes a lot deeper than we thought.
The one without rouge looks familiar.
Yes, but aren't we ALL related?!?
I hate these Russian custody cases.
I doubt we got the strangler.
Every time I get one of them to crack, another one pops right out.
I still feel like the little one's hiding something...
I can't be sure. They all look alike.
Russian, oh no, we're from Cleveland.
He figures if he questions them together, one is bound to crack. But the one on the far right is one tough babushka.
Well, they DID say an "inner voice" told them to do it...
Could be an inside job, Matryoshka.
The other ones appeared after we were married.
I thought it was bring your family to work day.
Think carefully, Mrs. Mertz...is it possible your assailant fled the scene in a larger version of herself?
Scarf.  Apron.  Rosy cheeks.  A real doll.  Can't recall how tall.
Just like the elections-Russians inside of Russians
Let's try it again with them sitting.
We rounded up these suspects using advanced facial recognition software.
The one on the left is hiding the most.
Yes, this is one of those times where your personal hobbies interfere with work, Mark.
My sisters were arrested at the airport, again.
I'm starting to think it was an inside job.
Sorry, Joan, but I'm still not seeing evidence of Russian collusion.
I don't see the resemblance.
As far as crime families go, this one is awfully cute.
Well, if there' is a Russian connection, I can't see any evidence of it.
When investigating a matryoshkacide, you start at the top.
This goes much deeper than we thought.
Sometimes I feel like there's a completely different person inside me.
Given the circumstances, our chance for an I.D. are greatly diminished.
I just know they're all covering for tiny
She identified the tall one, but I suspect the others were in on it.
I thought this case would be open and shut, but it looks like we have a copycat
I told you these perps were full of themselves, Martha.
It looks like another brilliant Russian diversion...and they say size does not matter.
I think the little one is still hiding something.
All I can remember is that she wobbled but didn’t fall down.
A board certified forensic psychiatrist diagnosed her with multiple personality disorder, but we found the others concealed on her person.
We finally snared that elusive Russian spy nest
Please don’t tell me you’re pregnant again...
Nice neck.
I  thought you said to round up unusual suspects.
The witness wants to know if you can you ask them not to smile.
They all look innocent to me.
Nyet...nyet...nyet...nyet...nyet.....NYET!
They opened up pretty quickly under pressure.
What else did the body cavity search find?
O.K., we've got the dolls, now bring in the guys.
If you ask me they’re all innocent, because women are the best. They’re so strong. And clever. Like my mom. Hey do you want to get a drink after work?
Looks to me like a case of Russian stacking.
To find yourself, you've got to look within yourself.
Would be easier if I could hear their voices. Can we make each of them say 'Make America Great Again?'
Probably an inside job.
See if you can get anything out of the little one.
I vaguely resemble a nesting doll.
Let’s tell the press this is why Hillary lost, and call it a day.
If the girl don't fit you must acquit.
Better call Internal Affairs.
I didn’t fit.
I should take the fifth or in this case maybe the sixth?
They're hiding something.
It's either all of them or none of them.
I have a feeling they'll crack easily under pressure, except maybe the little one.
You know how hard it is to find five other quadruple amputees for a lineup?
Yes, I spent some time with them. But there was no collusion.
 NO COLLUSION!
I personally think it was an inside job
Greta, I promise you... they're not sex toys
They all fit inside the description.
It's really a matter of perspective.
Nesting is NOT collusion right?
I knew I’d get her to open up!
For the last time Steve, stop sorting women by weight.
It was an inside job but the big one is going to take the fall for it.
This is not an open-and-shut case.  
It's more like an open-and-open-and-open case.
I think we should mix them up.
You said bring the whole family
It’s a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a Matryoshka.
Actually, they're all in it together.
They fit the mold.
I still think it was an inside job.
We're close. I just gotta figure out how the pieces fit together.
She's pleading the fifth, for the sixth time.
I want to start a family.
The evidence is stacked against them.
I couldn't tell if she did it, or whether it was her inner child, so I arrested them all
Yes, but why won't they open up to ME!?
You think she's still in there?
I’m starting to believe this was an inside job.
Grand latte, latte, moderate latte, latte minor, mini latte and micro latte.
Under Trump's new immigration laws my family will have to stay on the shelf !
Tell him we've uncovered a nest of Russian agents.
I could swear there was only one of them a minute ago.
Ok, let’s say that your theory explains how they pulled the heist with no arms or legs, then where the hell did they hide the diamonds?
I don’t know. I just feel so empty inside.
It had to be an inside job.
This is your final test. If you can tell me which one is the tallest and  if you swear loyalty to Donald Trump, you will be named the new director of the FBI.
Not much so far, but I can confirm the tallest one is an empty nester.
According to the DNA kit, my family is 95% Russian Stacking Doll.
No ma’am, I’m not hiding anything and the Russians were never involved.
Bob Mueller has the Trump set. It starts with Flynn, then Don Jr, Stormy Daniels, Cohen, Manafort, Trump, and the tiny one in the middle of it all is Putin.
OK, let's roll in the witness.
We think they smuggled each other across the border.
This goes deeper than we thought.
Let's hope the victim can contain herself.
Two more years and I move up to bobblehead dolls.
Maybe we should have gone the bobblehead route after all.
Trust me. The big one is covering for all the others.
Should we use just one holding cell?
They all fit the general description.
They're listening.
I knew there was a Russian connection. We found a nest of them.
Weird poster, Sarge.
What if they're all in on it...
I also have six sons
It could have been anyone of them. I’m pretty certain we’re looking at an inside job.
I know it's a one way mirror, but I still feel like they're staring at me.
It's really an open-and-shut case.
I think the tall one is covering for the rest of them
We know there's collusion, but they ain't talking.
Nyet.  No matter DNA, none of them are mine!
This won't work.  I can't get them to step forward.
Apart from the fat chick behind me, they've all done time inside.
You mean this isn't bring your family to work day?
I originally came here looking for my birth mother.
The cavity search results are in, and we found 5 additional suspects.
We're suspecting an inside job.
Yes,I fathered them all."
Don't be fooled by their looks; they were all in on it.
It's hard to tell, they all look so different.
She was an enigma wrapped in a riddle -- that's all I recall.
OK, but it still could be an inside-inside-inside-inside-inside-inside job.
Crimininologists claim that height is not an adequate descriptor.
This case has many layers to it.
It was the Russians.
The witness said it was the one with the sickly sweet smile.
I'm trying, but I just don't fit in.
Today is not 'bring your kids to work' day.
Well, they all match the picture the forensic artist drew for me.
The little one tells me the others are emotionally empty.
Instead of good cop, bad cop, let's try SAME cop, same cop.
You're positive she was Russian?
These Russians keep popping up in every investigation.
Have we decided which of these anonymous insiders penned the Times Op-Ed piece?
Here I am a detective, and all the while my  wife and children we're living a life of crime
Just guessing, but I assume the suspects are all related.
Putin says we can't put the Trump matrishka dolls up till the day after the midterms...
Should I ask them to turn to the right?
You said this was an inside job.
I feel sorry for the witness.
They claim it was only nesting, but I think we can get them on collusion.
At least we are not Barbies.
It looks like it's an inside job.
I told my therapist about my doll obsession and she told me to compartmentalize.
When he said she was a Russian doll, I didn’t know he meant literally.
They are charged with harboring a criminal.  Each of them.
Look at me and the Russian dolls, at least you've got a neck.
Obviously, it was an inside job.
We caught the Matryoshka Gang.
Better call Mueller.
You can  call it OCD, but I call it necessary ...
Let me guess you're holding them for a friend?
Detective, I gaurentee to you all these suspects except one will open up.
I rounded the usual suspects.
The problem is, all those Russians look alike.
This case has many layers, judging from the line-up
Nyet, I’m not Russian. I don’t even know any Russians.
I'm sorry lieutenant, but the finger printing is taking longer than I thought it would.
It's definitely an inside job.
Something tells me they're all in on it.
I'm thinking it was an inside job.
I told her to repeat what she said, and then this happened.
If it weren't for chain migration, my family would still be in Russia.
I've caught the famous Matryoshka crime family boss.
We think they’re covering for each other.  The witness only saw one, but they all insist they were there.
So you're the father of all those ersatz nesting dolls.
I can certainly see the resemblance.
Hurry this up. If you keep them in there too long they'll start nesting.
Don't let the smiles fool you, they're hollow to their core.
It was an honest mistake to bring them in. They spoke no English, had no documentation, and were hiding inside of one another.
I'm not sure but I think it was the fourth one from the right, or maybe the second from the left.
Have you ever heard of the "many worlds" theory?
Who and what are they hiding?
Well, they ran out of space in the morgue.
The name’s Detective Matryoshka, doll.
Well, you said that the suspect was full of herself.
Well it happened 25 years ago so I'm not sure what size she would be now.
Yes, I know I should have shaved this morning...
I don't get it. They only had one car.
I'm starting to think they are all in it together
So,  You're an empty nester
The evidence is stacking up. It was an inside job.
A family resemblance? With them or me?
It was easy to get her to confess...she just started opening up.
This is an internal investigation.
The special counsel caught them each hiding something
The small one’s hiding something
Considering the ongoing Russia investigation, they’re the best I could do.
Turns out her alibi totally stacks up.
The details fit together nicely.
We need to find out who they had on the inside.
At the very least, we know they are some how related.
This appears to be a case within a case within a case within a case. I have no idea where to begin.
Hmmm, you’re right, it all fits.
I'm stumped - we can't get anything out of the little one.
Go ahead, top me.
Are you SURE it’s the one in the middle?
Yes, detective, all the suspects DID come from the same neighborhood.
It was her or one of her sisters.
Just proves, you never really know someone until you look deep inside.
It's a case of perspective.
Ok. I admit it. I'm a matryoshakavist.
It's a matter of perspective... they all look alike to me.
OK, if you think it will help...….Number 3, please step forward, speak clearly and say 'I want you inside me'.
Honestly, captain, I think these suspects stack up better than any others we've seen.
well of course they aren’t talking... they’re all gonna cover each other”
It's useless, Barbara, they won't open up.
And they say we never go after the big ones.
“It’s obviously the third one, look at that smug look she’s got.”
Once we caught the tallest one, we had all of 'em
I swear there was only one of them a minute ago.
The little one's still hiding something.
Are you accusing me of stacking the evidence ?
You seen one perp, you seen 'em all.
Two years undercover changes a person, Laura.
I think the shortest one is hiding something.
I'm still not sure how deep this thing goes.
We've got enough to indict number six, but I still think she's hiding something.
I found them all together
Each one claims it was an inside job.
Can I see their side profiles?
Looks like an inside job to me
This might be an inside job.
The big one says it was an inside job.
It must have been an inside job.
We suspect insider trading.
We’re calling them the #me6 dolls.
The Captain wanted me up there, but then he realized I had legs!
Once we got the prime suspect to open up, she exposed the entire spy nest.
I have a funny feeling, it was an inside job.
She's the one in the middle. I'll never forget that babushka.
I said I want more arresting, not more nesting!
I sculpt what I know.
My family tree is more like a nest.
Case cracked. It’s an inside inside inside inside inside inside job.
It's gotta be the little one -- it was an inside job!
I think they were all in on it together.
The first one is suspicious to her inner core.
They've all alibied each other.
On the contrary, I know how to contain myselves.
It's about #metoo, isn't it?
Yeah, my daughters are all dolls. But one day they'll all leave the nest.
You’ just don’t stack up
Honest, darling. I haven't visited that sperm bank since we started dating!
I need a break. I think the one in the middle just winked at me.
This may have been an inside job.
This was an open and shut case, but you had to keep opening and opening and opening.
I think this might've been an inside job.
I told you they had someone on the inside!
Are you telling me that all your grandmothers are missing?
Something's not stacking up. Must be an inside job.
I think the one on the right is still hiding something.
...all I can remember is that she was stacked.
Our top suspect is the stocky one with the babushka.
We've have suspects and a motive, but I just can't make the pieces fit.
Oh, I bet you think they all look the same, don't you?
We can only find records on the tall one.
Well it was clearly an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
I'm letting 'em stew. They're so full of themselves.
Sure, they’ll eventually crack, but I have a feeling there’ll be nothing there.
You got to admit," boss lady, "five outa six ain't bad.
Mueller wants first crack...
What more can I say? I think it was the one with no dimples -- third from the right.
They're the Russian hackers?
My gut tells me this was an inside job.
Until we know for sure, I want to keep a lid on this thing.
This all seems to fit together.
Did you or did you not see Trump with these dolls?
They’re detained. Something to do with election interference.
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe, and Jane Doe.
I think the little one is at the center of it all.
This case has more layers than you can possibly imagine.
You heard this was an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job?
I don't know... I think they're covering for someone.
Our source says it was an inside job.
No collusion yet, but they'll open up.
I’m sorry doll, they all fit the profile.
I’ve got a hunch this was an inside job.
I suspect they're all hiding something.
I know the eye witness only saw one, but i'm sure they were all in on it!
It's the second one from the left, she confessed, said it was an inside job
The evidence just doesn't stack up"
I think we should cut back on the number of Russian sperm donors.
The Knicknack's attorney is on his way.
Yes, but sometimes what you see really is all there is.
Is this really necessary? We already got them to open up.
It's cheaper when I travel.
Please say yes.  I have this insatiable nesting instinct.
I swear I'm John Smith and they're all my kids. Mischka, Mooschka, Meyescha, Schneakin, Schlippin and Schnookum Smith.
I guess size does matter
I was always considered the black sheep of the family.
Look I know it’s a weird painting but I promised my wife I’d hang it up
They all have your eyes....
I've been accused of insider trading.
Before I answer that question, what are your views on bigamy?
This feels like an inside job.
I have a hunch the little one is hiding something.
No doubt. Third from the right.
It' s like mother's, mother's, mother's, mother's, mother's, mother always said.
Take your pants off: I know you are # 7
Go ahead. Ask me 'what's new.'  You know you want to.
Apparently it was an inside job.
Good news is, they'll only need one cell.
Of course that's her. I can pick her out of a crowd..
We're gonna have a full line-up.  We're not russian to judgment on this one.
[This is for last week's, I missed the deadline, but this is so good. Note that my magazine gets delivered late.]
It's my emotional support pizza dough.
Really? No connections with Russia?
They all had alibis.
I think there’s more deep down inside the one on the right.
They're all in on it somehow.
Call it instinct. They’re almost always hiding something.
I've been at this for 12 hours: as soon as I think they are about to break, there's a whole other layer.
They said it was an inside job.
I have no clue where the other five came from.
How could you tell I had artificial legs?
Its no good chief.I know they are all in it together but they cover each other really well.
It's the best we could do with these budget cuts.
It was the best I could do when he said she looked like his babushka.
We're trying to figure which one interfered with the election.
It's the third one from the right. The witness didn't mention rosy cheeks.
They claim to have dirt on Ken and Barbie.
Which one did it is a matter of perspective.
Anybody look familiar
It's Natasha. Moose and Squirrel are responsible.
No, it is not a good day. Things just aren't  stacking up as they should .
I told you it's the one without the rosy cheeks. How can't you see the difference??
I modeled them after my wife and daughters.
They say they were all together at the time of the crime.
It's what's inside that counts.
Yes, you need to see my son.  He's inside somewhere.
I ordered a Russian Bride, and this is what I got.
You never asked why I have no neck.
Strange, they’re normally so full of themselves.
You wouldn't fit in.
I still want to try for a boy.
Still think the whole Russia thing is hoax now, Trisha?
The pieces are starting to fit together- it's an inside job...
No, I can’t pick her out of the line up, they all look the same to me.
The Russians have seemingly figured out the perfect undercover strategy.
Usually Russian smugglers are less obvious.
I'm the legs in the family
With common name, Babushka!
The only thing I'm sure about is it's an inside job
Okay yes Wendy I did take the weed from the evidence locker again, but I regret it because now all of the suspects look like Russian dolls
Let’s face it:  Lineups have devolved into a hollow, repetitive experience.
I had a twin, but he cracked on assembly.
It’s looking like an inside job.
Something inside me says the short one has nothing to hide.
Number 1. That's the Empty Nester
I still think she's hiding something.
They all matched the composite sketch!
My wife's personal trainer kept telling her to work on her core.  I think we must have misunderstood.
It's now a case of Russian collusion, with multiple personalities.
We suspect it was Russian agents
Not what you’re thinking, Veronika.
There's something not right. The evidence is not stacking up...
I have a hunch they where in it together.
First it was "Weeble's Wobble" and now this...
Five of them have solid cover stories.
I could only get my sisters.
He took one look and said,"They all look alike to me."
He concealed multiple identities. But, no, there was nothing unusual about him...
Their stories all nestle into each other.
Show me where’s the doll that touched you.
It appears to be an inside job.
I feel like they're all hiding something.
I suppose you might be able to imagine how some people could find that comment offensive.
What? You think the Americans won't buy it?
Okay...well I don't think it's a microagression to call them 'dolls' in this case
#4, step forward.
The suspect is here.
Putin says Trump wants comrade doll #2 and #5 for his collection.
It's a tough case but don't worry - we have someone on the inside
I'd explain it, but you'd just dismiss it as reductionist.
There's a lot of insider information here.
It was down to one suspect. Now I've got six and I have to add fraudulent concealment charges.
They all say the same thing, "Death to democracy" in increasingly high-pitched voices.
How do they know we are Russian?
No one told me you were undercover.
Whaddaya mean I can’t call ‘em dolls?
I don't know Deborah,they all fit the description of "an insider Russian spy"
This has "Putin conspiracy" written all over it. Better call Mueller.
"I thought it was repeated 6 times..or maybe 7".
I've got something inside I wanna show you.
OK, next time Ill ask about the height...
This line-up is stacked.
These Russian Twitter trolls all look alike.
That moment when you find even your lineup has been hacked
I think they're all in it together.
Please don't give me that "They all look alike," baloney!
So how may female dolls have you opened up or otherwise molested Mr. Yuri ?
It was an inside job. The question is ... how far inside?
Bob, it's just not a good fit.
What? You don't think they all look the same?
Not sure yet, but we're thinking it's an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
I say we close this up.
A gift from the Dean of University Diversity.
I’ve sized them up and they’re ready to roll.
Watch out for the little one. She's the strong and solid type.
Yes, I am citizen.
I'm sure the evidence will begin to stack up shortly."
I feel we have met many times before.
Yes, she does appear to have some form of split personality disorder.
I'm telling you, it was an inside job.
I guess the question is, “is this an inside job?”
In a Russian lineup, size matters.
I think the one on the far right is hiding something.
The witness claims she only saw one woman.
Looks like the 'Like Mother, Like Daughter' saying goes on for all generations...
I believe that the little one has insider information.
That 5 foot Russian doll is not fooling me
I think number four had plastic surgery to conceal her identity.
I did tell you it was an inside job.
You know, sometimes I think: 'There but for the grace of God go I.'
The third one from the right is an imposter and maybe a spy.
They say they can't untie their babushkas. Got no arms. You gonna do it for them?
This whole caper -- it's a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a matryoshka.
She looked like that, but she seemed taller.
We got a positive ID from the victim.  Said he never forgets a facsimile.
Same old, same old. Says they all look alike.
The odds are stacked against her, but let's avoid Russian to judgment.
Can we line up the Wonder Woman set instead?
I think they're just covering for the short one.
We pulled 'em in as part of the Mayor's new "Eliminate Kitsch" program.
I can’t get any more out of them.  I think it’s an inside job.
I've got chills.  They're multiplying.
Jeez, it coulda been any one of ' em...
If you open up the big one, you'll find a shirtless Putin.
Despite the uncanny similarities, this shouldn't take long.  The witness said the suspect lacked dots on her cheeks.  That's number four, counting from left to right.
I couldn't get her to talk at first, but then she really opened up.
I know this looks bad, but the Agency's official policy strictly prohibits profiling
They're all involved – it’s an inside job.
How they slipped through Customs on one passport is under investigation.
We don't have anything right now, but I've got an inside man.
I don't know ,it's is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
Did the crime require arms?
Our youngest just went off to college and empty nest syndrome is 
really hitting us hard.
They look put together but I’m sure one will crack
Intelligence we received suggested that she’d been smuggling women into a woman nestled within another woman’s women.
I'm telling you, this was an inside-inside-inside-inside-inside job.
No officer, I don't think I can recognize her from a lineup.
So where do you see yourself five dolls from now?
Inbreeding.
And I am telling you that I CAN be objective in this case!
Good luck; with this gang it’s always one cover-up after another
It looks like we've gone from "chain" migration to "nesting" migration.
Who can tell? ALL these dolls know how to hide bodies.
I’ve got a funny feeling the little one is hiding something
I'd have to say, I think it was an inside job.
False accusers all, I swear.
I still think the little one's hiding something.
Looks to be an inside job, Frank.
I have to control the urge to rearrange them.
I smell a cover-up.
LIMERICK: When fogged by mental pollution...Let the evidence build your conclusion...One after one...From Russia they've come...And it all stacks up to collusion.
Call it a hunch - one of them is still hiding something.
We found them on six different Twitter accounts.
You think it was someone a bit taller?
I just don't think we should profile.
I knew she was hiding something.
Open and shut. All the evidence is stacked against them.
One of these is not like the other...
I can't stop singing "Hello, Dolly."
There's definitely no collusion with Russia, why do you ask?
I still have the feeling they did it together.
Well, I remember her face very distinctly...
Yes, my family are related to the Russian Mafia. But they're completely 'armless."
Sorry Captain, we did a cavity search and now it seems we have 5 more possible suspects.
I can’t see how any of them could have pulled this off without hands or legs.
Just goes to show there could be a Russian agent inside any of us
You're right boss - she could having been standing far away.
Inside job.
I'm pretty sure it's the Russians.
We caught one and they all came pouring out.
You think moving them around will help?
The fourth one, lacking the rosy cheeks, that’s Putin’s spy!..
Ludmilla, Anastasia, Svetlana, Tatiana, Oleg, and Barbie
We’ve given full cavity searches to all but one of them.
So I says, 'Listen doll face, we know it's an inside job'.
Our kids aren't stacked against us. They're stacked inside us."
The little one’s got an airtight alibi.
Oh, Russian HACKING suspects.
I was told to round up 'the usual suspects' for this Russian witch hunt.
It’s gotta be an inside job.
They've all got air-tight alibis except for the big one.
When you've seen one Matryoshka doll, you've seen them all!
And they all have that same twisted smile.
I keep my inner child bottled up.
The line up? The pat-down alone took all morning.
It's a helluva smuggling case.... which on do we charge with possession ?
My girls were out of school today, and I thought it might be fun.
So, it’s an inside inside inside job.
We've interrogated them for hours and they just won't open up!
My money's on the tall one, but they did say they go everywhere together.
I suspect Russian involvement.
I think we've hit a nest of Russian spies.
I think we’re looking at an inside job here.
The little one’s at the center of this whole thing, and she’s tough; we’ll need to bring down the hammer if we want to crack her.
Our witness thinks it was an inside-inside-inside-inside-inside job.
What makes you think the Russians have infiltrated my department?
Let's try again with their neck tattoos showing.
Sorry, I can’t be sure. They all look alike to me.
There were even more Russians at the meeting than we had ever imagined.
We’re thinking it was an inside job.
Same old, same old. Jeez!
The big one's legit. The rest were smuggled in.
Well I don't see what's wrong with them.
I just don’t fit in.
Our perp has someone on the inside.
If they nest, then all we must arrest.
It was only a matter of time until they opened up.
The DNA results are ready.
You will never fit in!
Just when I thought we were going to bust this case wide open...
Just look at the smirks on their faces. We have evidence of collusion, but no one's talking.
The clues are starting to fit together...
Show us where the doll touched you.
Solving this case has been like peeling an onion.
Uhm, i feel like this was a inside Job.
Mueller says to start making them with orange jumpsuits
The Usual Sus(us)(us)(us)(us)(us)pects.
I can't help feeling there's more to this than meets the eye.
My inner selves also need a break
It’s an alibi wrapped in a pretext inside an excuse.
Yes, there is a family remblance.
Don’t you think this line up is a bit redundant?
Nest, please.
Once the first suspect opened up, the rest were easy. But we couldn't crack the last one.
An inside job if you ask me
I cracked the case.
I just keep uncovering one thing after another.
I got the big one to open up, but it was all downhill from there.
Why do you assume I put together this lineup?
They said it's not Russia. I will say this—I don’t see any reason why it would be.
This was a major cover-up.
It was definitely 3, but a little taller.
I'd still like to see the DNA results.
I think one of them is still hiding something.
They fit into the description.
The deeper I get, the deeper it goes.
This is an inside job."
Inside me is a thin man, trying to get out.
Well, it's really just an empty feeling that I just cannot shake..
The perp's heighth is going to be an important identifying factor.
The suspect must have had help from someone on the inside.
I feel like I know them personally.
It was an inside inside inside inside inside inside job.
Sometimes I feel there is someone inside of me trying to get out.
I suspect that one of them is hiding something.
I don't know which to arrest. They all look like my mother.
This Russian investigation is getting smaller and smaller.
Would you believe I was the only boy out of all my siblings?
I'm afraid there are more layers to this investigation than we expected!
We caught them sneaking each other into the movie theater.
Their story just doesn't stack up
After she was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder she kept telling me I was destroying her "little nest".
They each voted only once. There was no collusion.
I'm positive one of them is hiding something!
I think it might be someone on the inside.
Personally, seems like it was an inside job.
As we go down the line, odds are, finding our culprit gets smaller.
What? They all fit.
I too feel like I'm beside myself.
Now if we can just figure out where the accomplices were hiding.
Something just doesn't stack up
Oddly, our new facial recognition system only identified #2 as a match to the suspect shown on CCTV cameras.
I don't think we are racially profiling,  why do you ask?
We suspect it's an inside job.
Number two is my mom.
The president says they have to be pardoned. They're Putin's nieces.
There's a clear hierarchy amongst them.
Where does it say that new recruits can't be family?
I'm pretty sure it's an inside-inside-inside-inside-inside job.
We found them during a cavity search of the larger suspect.
Whaddya mean, multiple counts of trafficking in persons??  I only hid one girl in the back of my truck when I left Moscow. I don’t know where the others came from!
I think it was all of them.
The Russians seems to be behind everything these days.
My gut tells me they're all hiding something!
They all weeble.  What we're looking for a wobbler.
We know one of them did it, but they keep covering for each other.
No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion.
I think I see a pattern in this case.
Ok, lets see if size matters.
The Mueller investigation may be out of control.
Shall we go bigger or smaller"
Dont tell me there are alot of other versions of you!
I want you to try to put the suspect into perspective
I feel as though I'm coming apart. I've lost my individuality. I'm searching for my inner self.
Yeah, the first three are Riddle, Mystery and Enigma, but I never learned the names of the ones after that
I have a feeling that #4's blush isn't the only thing that she's hiding.
It's complicated.
The weapon was not found in their Persons.
Is this what they call Russian profiling ?
Would No. 2 please step forward.
It’s not sexist Carol. The literally are dolls.
The witness claims she saw them all together.
Something inside is telling me one of them is trying to a bit too hard to fit in with the others.
We have an identity crisis.
Can you ask Number 3 to step forward?
I bet this was an inside job.
Barbie said it was all of them.
If you press the short one hard enough, she'll open up.
I think we're one and done here.
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from this tree.
Sorry, I'm
 not sure what nepotism means.
I still think it was an inside inside inside inside inside job.
We may never get to the bottom of this case — every clue has another clue inside of it and every suspect leads to another suspect!
The perp is using the multiple personality alibi.
This job supports me, my wife, and our five daughters
I swear. I had no idea my Babushka was the cover for illegal Russian Nanas-for-hire.
Они все это сделали.
You can bring in the witness Detective, but I really have my doubts on getting a positive ID on a suspect.
The Russian trolls are getting very creative
I know you wanted to stop at two, but I really wanted six children!
They refuse to hide anymore.
#matryoshka-too
The victim has some nesting issues.
It's only one woman!
Her alibi just doesn't stack up.
"I'm starting to think whoever it was, was an insider."
It’s the Matroyshka Crime Family. Make sure that last one isn’t hiding anything.
OK Bob, it's time to wrap up this Russia Investigation.
I know what you are thinking. This looks like an inside job.
Maybe the next one will be a boy.
One of dose tings iz not like da udders,
One of dose tings doesn't belong...
It is art, it’s supposed to copy reality, or it’s reality that copies… I forgot.
Bring in the witness—but I still say it's a Russian inside job.
I'm beginning to think this was an inside job.
I just feel like I don't fit in.
I know, third from the right, stands out like a sore thumb, but trust me, I found them all in the same place at the same time, and it was hard pulling them apart for this line up.
I’m afraid this lineup is a exercise in diminishing returns.
Just because I think you could stand in the lineup doesn't mean I think you're fat.
You think this lineup is an inside job? Maybe you've lost perspective."
This was definitely an inside job
After 27 years on the job, all criminals start to look the same.
Sex change? Why do you ask?
Word is they're gonna ask you to go undercover again.
The Trump doll is so popular it's on back order.  So why do the buyers keep sticking pins in them?
Let's get to the bottom of this
Don't worry.  The odds are stacked against them - we've got a guy on the inside.
How the hell am I supposed to know which one? They all look alike to me.
I REPRESENT RUSSIAN #ME-TOO.
It looks like they are covering for each other.
It's my installation art piece about the Mueller investigation!
Don't worry. We'll find out where that Russian mob is nesting.
We have reason to believe this is an inside job.
The Russia conspiracy is deceptively multilayered.
It turns out it IS all about the size.
I just Don't Fit!!!
We suspect Russian influence, but they aren’t talking.
Have you ever really looked inside yourself?
It's a trial separation.
I did not collude with any of these Russian dolls.
You think it was an inside job?
The big one cracked and gave us five co-conspirators.
What?
About all we know is that the suspect is Russian
I’m telling you Claire it’s whats on the inside that counts
My daughters are really big on cosplay.
The facial-recognition software failed to narrow our list of suspects.
What makes you think they were all in on it?
Cheer up  . 
I”ll change the prescription
I think that profiler guy was drunk.
So? It's what on the inside that counts!
This was a crime within crime within a crime within a crime within a crime within a crime. Now I’ve got it straightened out.
Yes, that is the way they stack up
They're all hiding something.
At one point, we did have it narrowed down to one suspect.
Vice said they sent us a lineup of Russian dolls. I got here early.
He recognized a few of them.
I have an inexplicable urge to nest.
This is going to be a hard case to crack, they all refuse to open up.
What makes you think this is an inside job?
The oldest wants her own shelf
Folk art rarely imitates life
I'm sure we all look alike to YOU.
Did you really talk to the Trumps about adoption?
I don't know what to say Boss... the big one cracked under interrogation and they just kept coming out...
If we keep going at this rate, our suspect will disappear.
I knew once we got Trump and Putin in a lineup no one could tell them apart
They're all guilty - 1 smuggler and 5 accomplices.  Trick question: how many jail cells will we need, Barnes?
I don’t see the Russian connection.
The eyewitness  ID was great except for the height and weight description.
I'm just resting. THEY'RE nesting.
She said the middle one looks like Keyser Soze
I'm not an agent.  I just trusted the matruskas too much.
It's clear that this job has reshaped you.
I’m looking for a seventh. Are you available?
What do you suppose they're hiding?
One of the toughest lineups we've ever had.
They only paid for one ticket to the movie so I'm charging them with grand theft.
It was a terrible crime..... murder by gravity.
Is it just me or are all these perps starting to look alike?
All these suspects are linked together somehow...
Of course I noticed your new hairdo,Barb.
Our leads keep shrinking the deeper we get into this case.
What profiling?
I'd recuse myself, but I don't wish to add another layer to this case.
We think it was an inside job
Don't let the rosy cheeks and humble traditional garb fool ya. These babushkas have done some pretty twisted things.
What makes you think it was an inside job?
Ask #4  to remove her kerchief.
It can’t have been ‘all of them’. Unless...an inside job?
I don't know--they all have nesting bitch face.
So, you’re positive your witness will pick out the perp.
Ok Humpty Dumpty  We have a. #metoo that claims there was more than a bucket of water involved
Well your eye witness is wrong. Number 4 is Jensen from Vice.
I'm not sure, they all look alike.
Couldn't we just get some ducks?
I just don't have it in me anymore.
Svetlana we already have 6 children...I am not Russian to have any more.
Boy, I hate these identity theft lineups.
Which dollface was it, dollface?
You got her to open up, now what?
I thought you said 'round up the Russian stackers.'
Would it be racial profiling if I said it was all of them?
Second one from the left is our suspect; the rest I found at the Christmas Tree Shop.  If the victim cannot identify the perp I have 30 days to return them or I'll get stuck with store credit.
I am 100% certain that I did not say "Ural suspects."
I suspect an inside job.
It was the little one.
All of them.
Not every case is “cookie-cutter,” detective. You need to think outside the box on this one.
DHS doesn't care if they're nesting. Each one has to have her own visa.
We're still trying to identify the key players in the Russia Investigation.
Solving this case is like peeling an onion. I keep finding more layers.
I got one doll for each day of the week. You don‘t want to know where the smallest is.
I’m in big trouble Mary...big trouble
Looks like we've got a RICO case here.
The evidence stacks up to #1.
Victim states that the perp squeaked then "flew off the handle."
I know how it sounds but they all do look alike.
'well, seems like an open and shut case to me...'
Your witness nailed it. And furthermore it all stacks up.
I just meant doll face like some waitresses call every guy honey.
Don't look at me. I think they all look like my Great Grandmama Mishka.
They’re all stacked against me.
The witness said there was only one of them.
This isn't what I meant when I said bring in the Russian smugglers
Sure you could put one away but, another one will always be waiting to come out.
Sorry, I can’t make a positive ID because they all have resting kitsch face.
I just don't feel like I fit in.
I'm Ukrainian actually, why do you ask?
She started choking,so I got behind her and performed the heimlich maneuver. Next thing I knew there were 5 more.
Finally, we have someone in the Russian’s inner circle.
The issue is that the security camera can't tell them apart.
What do you mean they are all mine?
I have a feeling I've seen number six somewhere before.
We both know this was an inside job.
All I can say for sure is they were all in on it.
The case is 'a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, but perhaps,' as Churchill said, 'there is a key'.
If you could hear the voices inside my head...
I don't know what got into me.
You said it was a gang that's dressed alike and eating people, but I never expected this
I'm losing my perspective.
They all have identical alibis.
Frustrating. Their every response is infinitely recursive.
What's the Russian Stockholm Syndrome?
Well, they're the usual suspects to me.
They said it was an inside job, but we aren't sure which one did it.
No one is going to take the fall for you this time, Mr. Weeble
Do you really think it was an inside job?
I have five smaller brothers. What about you?
The display is beginning to get on my nerves!
It’s Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
We know it was an inside job, we just don’t know how deep it goes.
That new tariff is starting to make us all redundant

Babies having babies....
Didn’t Trump know a “Rolly Polly”, little girl or not, will bounce back and smack him?
He said he had met the one on the left in Moscow, but he had never seen any of the others.
Da, Maria Butina, the new generation of Matryoshka surveillance dolls make wonderful gifts.  And they're non-partisan!
Their legs were removed by Russian hackers
Are there any others?
Something here doesn't stack up.
Im begging to think it was an inside job.
Can we get a sketch artist with a sense of scale next time?
Is it weird that number three reminds me of my mother?
So you're saying there's a difference?
My theory? This goes all the way to the top.
I admit it looks suspicious, but there was no collusion.
This caption was deleted for being too hilarious.
The smaller ones all have the same alibi, and the big one won't talk.
Working these cases leaves me hollow inside.
So, as you can see, my thesis of uniform female development is the true origin of The Handmaid’s Tale. Pay up!
Your opinion of me is starting to make sense.
They are in it together.
So the DNA results came back. They match that of a young Russian girl...
Regardless of size, all Russian women look the same to me.
What do you mean it was an inside job?
I cracked this case wide open, boss!
What you see is what you get.
Every time I get one of them to open up, another one appears!
Due to their close association, they're ALL accessories to the crime.
What can I say? You are what you eat.
Call me crazy, I say it's the Russians.
What? Chief said to stack the lineup.
Not again
sometimes I feel smaller and smaller”
Looks to me like an inside job.
How many times do I have to tell you?  I have no hidden ties to Russia.
Why should I say “aah”?
Third from the right. She's ready to talk.
The little voice, inside the little voice, inside the little voice, inside the little voice is telling me we have a problem with this case.
Well they only speak Russian, but these days that's an advantage.
It’s not what you think. I’m non-binary.
I guess that I just didn't fit in.
Sorry, but they’re the only women I feel comfortable taking to at work.
I wish I had a neck I could hang my badge around.
The problem was that it was an inside job.
I just feel empty.
We found the drugs in the last one.
My instincts tell me it was an inside job.
I suspect this was an inside job.
Print out the Weebles file. There may well be a connection.
We've got someone on the inside.
Quite a nest of thieves you've discovered Detective.
I know, instead of my dogs and I looking more and more alike, ...”
They're tired of nesting, and they'd like some vodka, please.
I can't shake the feeling this was an inside job.
What Russian bias?
The victim said she looked Russian, we had trouble finding enough Russian-looking women for the line-up, so I improvised - what's the problem?
We're pretty sure there's Russian involvement.
Well, we're not sure about height.
I  swear there were only three suspects in the lineup when we started.
I'm starting to think it was an inside, inside, 
inside, inside, inside, job
Being the only boy, I grew up feeling special, but now I just feel empty inside.
Your six-pack lacks a black.
Hard to prove collusion if  the Rooskies won't talk.
I think I have Matrushka Collusion Syndrome
I’ve been leaving early to be with my wife. She has empty nest syndrome.
The dolls look lie me before my sex change
My gut tells me the little one is still hiding something.
I'm not big on conspiracies but I'm pretty sure they're hiding something.
we're downsizing
Prisons here aren't overcrowded. We put one prisoner inside another.
I hate working cases in Brighton Beach, Marci.
It's a slow day so I thought I'd bring the family in
New suspects keep popping up!
Run down to Starbucks and get a Short, a Tall, a Venti, a Grande, a Trenta, and a Quaranta. Pronto.
Just when we think we got to the bottom of it, another one pops out.
Do you recognize any of these people as the perpetrator whom you saw stealing the baby?
Captain, isn't this "Bring Your Family To Work" day?
Sorry, Captain- they're just too full of themselves.
Was your assailant any of these women?
It doesn't matter how cute they are. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
It seems like every time we question one, the next story becomes a little less believable...
When we talked about going undercover, I didn't realize I'd have to literally GET INSIDE the organization
Trying to prove that size doesn’t matter.
You've got to change your Weeble ways...baby.
This is a tough one. Maybe we should have them each say, ""Good morning, Mr. Kushner.
I am the oldest of six.
It appears to me that it was an inside job.
Russian collusion? What makes you say that?
Turns out there's no fun way to tell your employees about downsizing.
See, I told you the Russians were taking over organized crime at every level.
Number Four, wobble forward please.
Look, this is the best we could do based on your description.
Looks like Russia is meddling in our selection.
Unfortunately, your cloning' s diminishing returns disqualifies you. Better luck next time!
I think they all look more like cops."
I gotta call EAP.  I'm losing it.  I can't stop trying to contemplate infinity.
I thought you said there was only one suspect
Well. Gosh. I’m beginning to suspect this was inside job.
They don’t all look the same to me.
I’m tellin’ ya, it was an inside job.
I was going to say the clues in this case were starting to fit together until this lineup SNAFU.
It's good that we don't have to separate from their parents anymore.
Every time I crack this case a new suspect comes up...
I don’t know ...This case feels like a riddle inside an enigma inside a conundrum.
I confess. It was an inside job.
Too bad our witness got everything but the height.
I got nuthin'. You?
Yes, I am this country's premier forensic sketch artist.  My reconstructions are not influenced in any way by personal prejudices.
Had to let  her go, couldn't pick her out of the lineup
I can't get nothing out of 'em, they just keep speaking Russian at the same time.
Since our kids moved to Moscow, we're experiencing empty nesting doll syndrome
My family and I have an interest in a bowling alley.
What do you mean with "suspicion of partiality"?
'How's that "getting inside the criminal mind" working out for you?'
yes, I am so sorry, they all said “Me Too”
My wife says I'm derivative.
It’s part of our new Russian diplomacy program.
It's always an inside job with the Russians.
I'm trying to find my inner selves.
These are the armed robbery suspects?
This one took us a while to unpack.
Sorry, I'm in a solid relationship!
They call themselves "the Onions."
One of them is hiding something, but which one?
Well, they all look the same to me.
Let's eat in tonight, I feel like nesting.
One of them's wanted for possession. Heck maybe all of them.
Of course I'm their father.   Can't you see the resemblance?
I knock on wood and all I get is girl. I vont
vasectomy right no
Comrade, I think the little one is hiding something.
Katia, you just don't know who I am inside.
Are you sure there is no collusion?
The witness said the culprit had a nesting bitch face
Seems like an open and stack case, chief
As the only man in the family, I didn’t quite stack up.
I never said "mafia", I said we'd be taking on the "matryoshka".
First step is a gender change.
We finally have a line-up of all those present at that adoption meeting.
The teller swears she only saw one of these suspects. The other five must have been hiding some
where.
WHAT? YOU THINK I'M HIDING SOMETHING?
Okay, send in Manafort first; Flynn, next, then Don, Jr....
Hey, you're the one who chose the officers to stand with the suspect ...
I dunno cap’n, something doesn’t fit
These suspects are hard to size up and I can't get any of the victims to make a positive ID.
Word on the street is it’s an inside job.
Only one contains the Russian Novichok nerve agent.  The rest are filled with borscht.
I'd bet my reputation it's an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.
I'm starting to suspect collusion.
Okay, let’s start with you removing your head
Captain, I went undercover, and we nabbed the entire Kokeshi gang, all hiding in one tiny box.
I think they are still hiding something
They all claim no Russian nesting.
Do you think the victim's ID will hold up in court?
Where did  all the other 5 of you go?
I deny any Russian collusion.
They’ve agreed to cooperate in the Russian collusion investigation.
I'm struggling to see how all this fits together.
i would love to hear about your inner self
They all have the same alibi.  They say they were all together.
Okay, come clean. We know you're smuggling women in those containers.
We've got suspects. The usual. Rounded up. Now they need to be rounded down.
Only the first five are my wives. The last one's my daughter.
Something inside keeps wanting more.
Can you find the one that's not the same?
'I think the last one is hiding something.'
I suspect there is another insid-her
I can't identify.  They all look alike to me.
Sir, we are ALL searching for our inner self.
All these body searches are getting us nowhere.
The odds are stacked against us getting a positive ID.
We can't get a break, they're all covering for one another.
The odds may be stacked against us...
I was NOT profiling!
My staff will pop up later.
Please take over for me, Sarge.  I can't bear to see my family put through this.
Just another day in the tax fraud department.
For the last time, please stop calling this an ineggstigation
Manafort flipped.
What!  He wants to use MY matryoshkas to influence the election?  -   Collusion!
I want a divorce-I now need time for myself
The orders were, ‘Make it pleasing to the POTUS’.
It was Norm's idea.
Deep down inside--they're all guilty.
I had no idea she had a split personality.
Matryoshka gang member snitched from the inside.
Can you pick which one has been meddling in are affairs?
They don’t nest in captivity.
What else are they hiding?
Of course they are here, but there’s no collusion
I just can’t decide which one I like the best.
Call in Vladimir, maybe he will be able to tell them apart.
Don't get me wrong Babs, the witness is a doll.
We know a voice insider her made her do it, but the question is <i>which</i>.
It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is the Russian national interest.
I know... it's supposed to be a witch hunt. But I keep finding these.
She just up and left me. Kept complaining about an empty feeling.
We're thinking it may have been an inside job.
The Russian mafia just isn't what it used to be.
The Matryoshka family does not believe in birth control.
Clearly, a cover-up by the Russians.
Are they a bit wooden? Yes. Are we the Moscow Police Department? Hell, yes.
This was supposed to be an open-and-shut and open-and-shut and open-and-shut case.
What can I say?  She was Russian and a real doll!
Its called "Six Dolls of Collusion."
I think that the one on the right is hiding something.
I got it--'no' meant 'no'--so I asked if she had any sisters.
I think one of them might still be hiding something.
Looks are deceiving. I call them the Gang of 6.
Yes, officer, I do believe this is an open and shut case at every level.
What other gang would assault a turducken?
I told you it was an inside job!
The White House called and they wanted us to put together a lineup of potential future wives for Donald.
We think Putin's behind this one.
They say they are here to see our cathedral...
No, Mam, we cannot open up number 2 and insert number 3.  Can you think of another characteristic of the suspect?
I am ready for my next modeling job
I just thought this would crack the case wide open.
My perspective of this case is forced.
The smallest is a riddle, which is wrapped in a mystery, put inside an enigma; but then the next three are really big and nasty.
This empty nest syndrome is a bitch.
Ten witnesses and we can't get a positive ID. I should have known that each one would have a different perspective.
Don't matter they don't have arms: smallest bounces the wallet out of the victim's pocket and the others become a 5-card Monte so no one knows where the wallet really is! They scatter, reassemble as one person, then blend into the crowd to get away.
We had to put the baby up for adoption. She just didn't fit in'
The six of us are discussing your offer.
I've narrowed it down to a Russian with no limbs.
I see now I maybe shouldn't have put these particular suspects in height order.
I have been doing this contest for over fifteen years, won it once, and I have no idea what this scene is all about.
So, what you're saying is, these shoes are "One Size Fits All"?
They might be hiding something.
there were a gift from my Russian friend Vladimir.
I don’t think the little one is willing to open up.
Well, I think I should at least be ahead of Eric. Maybe between him and Donald Jr.
The Russians are sending a message
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
Remember, one of these Russian dolls is not like the others.
I am sorry to dismiss you, Natalya, but you just do not fit in.
It's the Babushka Gang; I know they're hiding something.
I think the one without red cheeks is too obvious
Their alibis all fit inside each other's.
The tall one was the hardest to round up.
We believe it was an inside job
It was definitely the second one from the left...DEFINITELY!!!
I think we have a case of mistaken identity.
They relate to me for some reason — just a few more questions to see if their story stacks up.
All five of our eyewitness selected differently.”
Hey doll...
I’m infiltrating the Russian mob.
OK, so the small one did it... but how are we going to get her to open up?
What's wrong doll face?
At least we know it was an inside job.
There was no Russian involvement!
Our witness couldn't ID the suspect -- the lineup is stacked against him.
I know they're hiding something
I distinctly remember she had a removable face.
Next nestion, I mean question.
We figured human trafficking. 
Turns out they're full of cocaine.
The usual suspects.  Pick a size.
. . . take your daughters to work day, why?
Of course I can remain partial, I was just their donor Dad.
We believe the crime was an inside job.
Now do you see that a cavity search was justified?
I need to recuse myself.
I know, its extraordinary, we've contacted ancestry for confirmation.
My bad.... I thought you said get the 'NEST' of the usual suspects
I think it;s a crime family.
The inflatable Putin nesting dolls go from piroshki- to gulag size
OK, I admit it. I have a type.
All I remember is the suspect hiding inside another suspect hiding inside anther suspect hiding inside another suspect…
It's only  a matter of perspective..
I warn you, Natasha. I'm an empty shell.
I really thought this case would be open and shut.
I'm thinking of getting in touch with my inner child.
I'm telling you, it's always an inside job with this group.
It's  collusion alright, but I can't figure out how it all fits together.
Just resting with the nesting.
Obviously the one without blush on her cheeks.
The witnesses claim all Russians look alike.
These suspects aren’t stacking up the way I had hoped.
I can't stop thinking about that first  "Alien" movie.
Harmless, nothing! We've got evidence that they tipped the vote in twenty-seven counties.
I don't know who did it, but my gut tells me it was an inside job.
I'm quite in touch with the feminine inside.
зависит от того, насколько далеко был свидетель.
Part of me thinks they're all guilty.
You can drop the internal smuggling charge but she's paying for 6 economy seats.
I swear.  I only knew the mother .
...but I feel like a woman on the inside.
They all claim to be dolls, not trolls"
I feel like there's a small Russian woman inside me, trying to get out
One thing is for sure, it was an inside job.
You’re so full of yourself
How in God's name would I know?   All women look alike . . .
I should seen it -- a doll within a doll within a doll....a Russian spy!
I don’t care what the DNA test results say. They’re not my kids!
When they complain about the strip search, we use those props to show just how far we could go.
The suspect is described as a white babushka with quaint features.
I just know she’s in there somewhere.
She said I would make a great model for the male doll.
Are they still all looking at us?
When Russia's involved, it takes a while to get to the bottom of things.
What do you mean, me too?
She’s the one, alright.
Clearly, this was an inside job.
Victim says number 4 looks familiar.  Can you ask her to turn to the left?
The charge?” “Human trafficking.
We all hold so many others inside.
No, you see, it's an optical illusion; they're actually all the same size.
I got her to open up, but she was full of herself."
I don't think a line-up that only includes your sisters will fly with the sargeant.
This is a doll hunt.
Our first witness said they all infiltrated the NRA
OK which one of these is not involved in the inside job?
ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET THEM TO LEAVE THE NEST?
I think this is going to be an open, and open, and open, and open, and open and shut case.
Why did the kids get smaller every time we mated?
I think she's full of herself.
That's a bit racist, don't you think?
It's either the one in the middle, or the other one in the middle.
23&me
There’s no way you’re getting me to testify against the Russian mafia.
The Ken of Russian dolls came with legs. And responsibilities.
Why do you ask?
I'd like to fit inside the small one.
I feel so small inside
It looks to be a Russian conspiracy
If my hunch is right, the little one is at the center of this thing.
Every time we make a break in this case, our list of suspects grows.
We’re about to be downsized.
I promise. I had a vasectomy. There won’t be anymore.
So, you're charging me with insider trading?
We finally cracked the Kiev nesting doll crime syndicate.
This is the oddest "#Metoo" moment ever!
They have a solid alibi ; they were inside all night .
They all appeared to be in the same place at the same time when the crime was committed, except for one....
We have witnesses lined up.
Number six looks like she's hiding something.
We knew the case was solved when the big one cracked and little one told details to the inside job.
I'm not sure 'getting her to open up' was really helpful.
The witness tapering trap is set.
I was really hoping it would be a geometric sequence.
It’s all a matter of perspective, Officer.
Cultural ethnicity at the root of all play and art.
This is tough. Please return them to their nest until tomorrow.
Believe me, I know their M.O.
My mother was a Matryoshka!
What do you think they’re trying to cover up?
Looks like an open-and-shut, open-and-shut, open-and-shut, open-and-shut, open-and-shut case.
Yes, Natasha left, but it doesn't affect my work.
Well, well, well. I was wondering when the No Fun Police would arrive.
Are you from Tinder? Did you swipe left or right?
Sounds like an inside job.
It’s not bring your child to work day.
We got the others to open up, but I think the little one is still hiding something.
We suspect Russian interference.
I gotta hunch they's all covering for the little one on the end.
Third from the left, but a little bigger
Anyone of them could've done it, Chief. It's a matter of perspective.
my wife always wanted a boy who looked like me.
No I'm not a smuggler. I'm just here for the stereotype support group.
But it's not a crime, my youngest didn't open up either.
I know it's not politically correct, but they ARE dolls.
Well,in this instance size does matter.
Chief, why are the women in my life always so full of themselves?
You'll never guess where I found them hiding.
Obviously it's an open and shut case of foreign collusion.
I think it’s time to open them up.
Russians have come.
We’re still trying to get to the center of this.
My inner self is less hollow than you think.
There's a lotta layers to this one.
Dave call Call ICE immediately! They must be separated, how do they keep hiding from us?
The odds of identifying the right suspect are stacked against us.
He'll still never admit the Russians had anything to do with it.
Some how they all fit together
I'm guessing it was an inside job.
I did not have sex with these women.
i'm thinking the big one.
How are things stacking up?
No, they're not sold individually.
It’s probably an inside job.
It feels like something inside me is screaming to get out.
Before I identify her I'd like to hear them speak.
How do I know that's you?
Are you here for the Russian Doll Symposium?
Ogres have layers, onions have layers, we all have layers.
"We're confident the left one is behind the recent theft of so many nest eggs.
I think they're all hiding something.
I'd like you to meet my family. My wife,Nikita,and 5 daughters- Galina,Raisa,Natasha,Kalista,& suggested by a friend,Ivanka.
Definitely the girl in the middle.
I get the feeling they're in cahoots.
I'm just not that into you.
I don't know about you, Agnes, but they're all starting to look alike to me
Just because she's stacked doesn't mean she shouldn't be able to nest in public.
Sorry, I was watching the Faberge eggs."
These Russian dolls are just so full of  themselves.
Hey boss, I've got the collusion line-up all ready to go.
I'll need to see them all wearing high heels.
Yes, I colluded.
"Rosebud?
They all did it...
I'm not hiding anything, why do you ask?
Let's see how deep this thing goes.
I just feel so hollow without my little girls.
I don't get it, but Rachel Maddow is pretty certain it's one of these.
I don't know; this just doesn't add up.
Their resemblance could have been coincidence.  No collusion!
I think one of them is my mom.
The press is gonna say we are profiling again.
Big family, second job, gotta pay for the nest.
Remember: Inside every matryoshka doll is another matryoshka doll just waiting to get out.
On my word as American Ambassador ! None of these are my children. The president can vouch for me.
Number 3 step forward and say "We didn't influence the election."
Do you like my Russian nesting doll mural? I thought I'd personalize the office space.
Guess which doll the pot is in and get promoted to capitan."
Yes, all were caught huddled together in the vicinity of the meeting with Don Jr. and Manafort...
I keep finding new layers to this case
It's Bobuska and no I don't have a mini me.
The hours are long, it's dangerous and, yes, you are the tallest partner I've had in the last six years.
If  I’ve told you once, I’ve told you six times, I don’t know her.
I had to grow this mustache so you wouldn't think I was one of  them.
The suspects of  tampering with the US election
I have unstacked them in order to give them their own identity.
I swear there’s no Russian collusion!
Yes Dear,  the girls do seem to take after my side of the family.
The trick is actually getting the big ones to flip on the little ones.
Simply blaming the Russians is not the answer this time!
Lana, these are real witnesses ... they didn't just pop out of my head!
There's a pattern of collusion here, I just know it.
I think we can safely call this the "Russian Doll Caper."
Yeah, easy to say,being someone with shoulders.
The odds are deminishing that anyone will pick the correct stacking doll.
They're inscribed: To Don, Love Vlad.
This is a witch hunt.  NO COLLUSION! I've never met these women.
Well, I said the words 'collection' and 'meddling', suddenly the president called and said, 'no collusion' and then Gulliani showed up and said, 'not a crime' and took the witness away...
I'm a forty year-old man with a woman inside him. And a woman inside her. And a woman inside her. And a woman inside her...
It's really an optical illusion.
It seems distance is an issue here...
I think it was an inside job; so, I’m betting it’s the tiny one.
So, Lieutenant, you're saying I really screwed up on my first line up, aren't you?
I'm sorry. All Russians look the same to me...
I wouldn't exactly call it a foot chase
Who's guilty? I suppose it's a matter of perspective.
I have a bad feeling we're never going to get to the bottom of this case.
Well,now that you  ask, kind of  queasy.
Actually, I need seven wives.
I'm already outfitted with backup.
It was as  close as I could get on short notice.
Which of my many iterations would you like to talk with?
Why you theenk Russian deed it? Could have been American Girl Doll?
Well, at least one of them must fit the description from the witness...
We got dirt on the big one, but the others are all clean.
Detective, this is clearly an inside job.
Why are we here?
This case has so many layers to unpack.
I'm sorry but I STILL don't understand how perspective works.
One size fits all...
I get what you're saying, but actually it's technically not a neckbeard.
I swear, I never saw them before before .
My sister, my mother, my sister, my mother...
I'm just a shell of my younger self.
'Let us lock you up inside a Nesting Doll', they said.. 'It will be fun', they said..
The tall one is my wife
So I sez, ‘yo, doll,’ and she knocks me over. Again and again. ‘Til I saw double.
yes--this is indeed a terrible setup for humor.
You bring a whole new meaning to empty nester.
I think they're all connected.
And just when did you plan on telling me about them!
I thought this would be a tough case to crack, looks like she opened up.
Yeah sure, they can paint me up as a woman but I’m not wearing a skirt.
I know them all—Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, and Matryoshka.
You know I can't stick my neck out for you on this one, Karen.
Where do I fit in this lineup?
It can’t be a coincidence that we found these in Trump Tower and the Oval Office!
That's hilarious Chief, but for the last time, no, you may not "twist me open."
Are you sure there aren't any more suspects?
Where's your sense of humor?
The Russians  deny any connection.
I don’t know about you, but things aren’t quite stacking up...
This could be an inside, inside, inside job.
Easy round-up. The suspects were all hiding in one spot.
Apparently the offender was a little smaller.
You really believe they are gang members?
We realized they’re all nanny cams
Maybe we should go with the photo lineup instead.
It was the redhead.
I feel like I just don't really fit in here, ya know?
I realize the odds are stacked against you.
I'm sorry, you just don't fit in here
I don't know what the charge is, but you've got six gorgeous dolls there.
Am I related to anyone who works here?  No, why do you ask?
So, do you speak Russian?
I keep repeating myself.
I’m sure it was number 2.
I just wish they took up less space.
The witness just said he could have sworn there was only one.
Okay, I admit it. I'm the one who keeps stealing your salt & pepper shakers.
I've been doing this job too long- everyone is starting to look like a perp to me.
We need to stop for today. That's our 18th suspect and the witness still isn't sure.
Oh, Russian PUPPET. Well how are we going to arrest the President?
We've rounded the usual suspects.
I spent my Nest Egg fighting for Nest Egg Gender Equality!
I'm convinced they're hiding something, but I can't get anyone to open up.
I don't see how this line-up is a result of profiling
But I thought you said our Perp was an empty-nester.
Without them, I’m empty inside.
It’s a riddle inside a mystery inside an enigma inside a conundrum inside a problem inside a puzzle.
Last chance Sergey...which Babushka is the insider?"   "I'm telling you, they ALL are."
I hope this is the last case I see like this, but I know it won't be.
These Russians dolls really stick together...
Haven’t I seen you somewhere before? There’s something about you that seems so familiar.
I can't think of a more perfect fit for me.
You said Russian. These ARE the usual suspects.
One of them is the insider that's inside the insider that's on inside with the Russians.
My gut says this is an inside job
I have always had an intense nesting instinct, comrade Kewpie
This gang is slick, but the weak link is always dimpleless; carry her in for interrogation.
I'm hoping our next one will be a boy.
Yes, Chief! the line-up is ready!
If Trump is impeached, we're out of business.
See, I told you that size matters.
I think the little one will talk if we can get her to open up.
To crack this case, we need someone on the inside.
I think my jury is stacked.
Next time no babushkas. OK?
We only need one suspect, then all the rest will fit right into place...
Chief, I'm beginning to think this was an inside job.
I just searched my ancestry online and discovered i am hermaphrodite !
You really needed my chair for this?
'It would be less work if we nest them inside each other.'
Stop Russian my investigation.
Who did Trump hire?
I think it's number 3, but I'm just not sure.
I think it looks too much like profiling.
They weren't ALL spotted at the scene.
Any of these look like the person who poisoned you?
I don't think you would fit in.
I forget the suspect was described as "definitely not hollow"
We've rounded up the Ural Suspects
I'd like to be taken off this case, sarge. They all remind me of my nana.
Only the big one fears prison.
Do you think we’ll ever get to the bottom of this case?
I’d prefer stacked Barbies.
You take the lead on this one. I do better with Weebles.
What I don't get is why the teller keeps insisting there was only one stick-up man.
It looks like this might have been an inside job.
#YouToo
We're not sure you're fitting in here...
Believe me, Dolls do walk !!
Well, it’s entirely possible this was an inside job.
YURI: We need Stormy Daniels, age four to forty!
Something inside me says we'll get to the bottom of this.
You think maybe the Russians are behind this?
There could be more hiding in plain sight.
They all look so similar, more or less.
I got my girls just where I want them.
Look. You're gonna want to fit in around here...
I think it was number 3, but, they all look alike.
Nothing fits.
Luckily we had a man on the inside.
Looking at the suspects I get the sense it was an inside job.
We've got her on five counts of occlusion
How many Russians were in the meeting?"

"Well how could I know that?  They all look the same to me.
Personally I think we can let the little one go, she can't harbor a fugitive.
I still have not received my royalties check!
The big one has an alibi, so we know that it was an inside job.
I think they’re working together
All I ever want to be is empty nester.
We really appreciate your dedication Carl, but we feel like now may be a good time to take some time off.
Excellent idea superintendant, we can teach doll art and math ratio simultaneously"
I bet you $1 that the editors change this to the ‘meme’ contest.
Deep down inside,I know she's guilty.
Another Day at The Border.
Why do you think you’ll fit in ?
What happens inside stays inside
We suspected Russian collusion...
Trying to prove collusion is like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
I always get these cases.  I’m the toy cop who got his wish to be a real boy.
Nyet! Ukraine.
Yes we all look a bit like Putin. Big chests, no necks. But I swear, we’re not related
Crime runs in the family.
Did you think it was immaculate conception?
sure...Eastern, Orthodox, Mormon!
Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit in .
But it's what's inside that counts.
This case has layers.
This has all the makings of an inside job.
I don't know, boss, but I'd say the description fits.
And they say size doesn't matter.
I don't know.
I,too, feel the need to express my inner child, Marsha.
We are down to six suspects...
It's a portrait  of  my wife.
I don't know where I fit in.
I can't get rid of this feeling that there is someone inside me waiting to get out.
I always feel that you are hiding something inside you.
Deep down, aren't we all really the same?
I told you our next case would be smaller than the last one.
How was I supposed to tell them apart?
I've never had a more useless lineup.
It's the supersize culture.
I don't do group therapy. I'm too afraid to open up and let people see the real me.
Forget the lineup.  All Russians look alike.
I'm innocent. 
My dolls are not child pornography.
Each one is capable of hiding something
Somehow, they all look alike!
Stop repeating “ weebles wobble!”
Putting them to bed is a breeze.
problem is, they don't mind it on the inside.
We are not Russian. Believe me. Bigly.
Don’t be so hard on yourself, everything skews younger these days.
Yes, the evidence points to the Russians hacking our cloning program.
I always get this mixed up. It's either "all relative" or "all relatives".
Tell number four to put on some makeup and bring in the witnesses
Then what the hell kind of Russian insiders did you mean?
The police lineup is ready for the witness, Sargent.
... each one has a different story.
After a while in this job you begin to lose your perspective.
I think your perspective is skewed.
Our witness said she has a scratch across her left brow; it turns out they each have a scratch across their left brow.
So, which one do you think was in the Trump Tower meeting?
Putin called, “Get your boobbuskas and get out of here”.
They may be criminals, Janice, but at least they don’t mind getting dolled up for work.
No, that's an optical illusion.
Let's just wait for the DNA results before we jump to any conclusions.
I'm this close to getting them to open up to me.
I don't think it's going to stick if the witness just says it was the Russian.
The third one from the left is Matryoshka
Feeling skinny living in a fat person's body
Honestly, I only touched her scarf and base.
Sure it seems weird, but I’m telling you, they love foot rubs
Me too....
The babysitter is sick
I don't know, they came at me one after the other Karen
It seems like it was an inside job".
My gut tells me they're all involved, somehow - and I think the little one on the end could be Russian"
Inside me, there's a series of women, dying to get out.
I heard he liked Russian dolls of all sizes. Okay, maybe my snitch shouldn't have put it that way!
I think #6 is hiding something.
You should get to know the man inside me.
No, Mr. Huevos is my father. I just look like him.
Dead ringers, every one...
Why are you russian out of the room, doll?
There was an inside woman. And an inside-inside woman.
We believe the perps are related.
Well is there an engagement ring in the last one?
Now that we’ve opened up the suspect I think we can declare this one a case closed. weid%22:1%2C%22surl%22:%22https://www.newyorker.com/
To catch her, you first need to get inside her.
I can see your butt.
I think you may be too close to this case.
None of these, but I can tell you that whoever did this is an empty vessel of a woman.
I know. Something's just not stacking up.
Why am I getting the feeling that this line-up is stacked against me?"
We looked everywhere, Inspector, and we can only find the big doll.
She gave me her babushka dolls, so I let her go through.
I think we’ve got enough to put five of them away.
The victim couldn't give much of a description, but said she was a real doll...
What do you mean 'trolls'. I thought you said find out everything about Russian dolls.
Sorry, doll... You're not my cup of tea.
POLYGAMOUS?! My wives are lying!
I have to report a conflict of interest...
C'mon, Sarge!  Even though things don't yet quite stack up, we gotta let 'em go.  Besides, they just got here from the old country and don't look like they'd try to run.
I dunno, Muller ordered the lineup.
Oh my, look at that neck! awrrr!
My dog looks like me, too.
All I can tell you, Carla, is that this is starting to look like an inside job.
WHO is the father of the forth one ????
We’re all a little Russian inside if you go back far enough.
I give you one last chance to stay in Spy School: Who is most famous shortstop for New Yorker Yankees?
maybe if we think outside the box we will have a boy?
Each time I crack the case, another one pops up.
You can talk about the child within to your therapist!
I'm sorry, but without legs they'll never make it to The Rockettes!
Well, obviously, they didn't walk here.
Can you show them to me nested again?
What do you mean, you have a problem with the lineup?
Wendy, I am going to need your help with this serial mother.
We’re trying a new strategy to address suspected Russian witness tampering.
We're going to have to let you go. Your blank stare has lost its luster.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking —they're all guilty.
So I called in my daughters.  What of it?
No, you cannot file them as dependents.
Apparently, they're begun to genetically modify dolls
We have a small home.
I asked you to arrange a lineup of Russian sweating molls.
This is hard for
me; she was a completely different woman on the inside.
I hope you're the largest one of the group.
I'm just a lonely empty nester
They suspect me of colluding with Russia.
Then one day you wake up an empty nester.
Her alibi just doesn't fit"
As Russian puppets, they are programmed. They hear “my last election” and “more flexibility”, they say “I will transmit this information to Vladimir”.
Keep them separated -- you'll see their alibis are hollow.
Evil lurks inside of everyone.
When the witnesses look at the line up make sure they know size matters.
Whadda ya mean it's not a good line-up, Lieutenant?"
Their alibi is airtight
I DUNNO--I'M HEARING A LOT OF CONFLICTING VOICES INSIDE MY HEAD;  IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THEM!
What'd you do with their arms?
The perp is probably hiding in plain sight.
I thought it would be an easy case to crack open, but now it's beginning to look like an inside job!
Who you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes and eyes and eyes and eyes and eyes and eyes and eyes?
Yes, they're just six chips off the old block.
Matryoshka and I lead a multi-layered life.
We suspect the Russians.
If say it was the little one, but I'm afraid there's something even smaller and more evil that made her commit the election fraud.
Could you ask numbers 2 through 5 to climb inside of number 1?
This could take an eternity.
What? Are you saying all Russian girls look the same to you? Don't be racist.
I’m not so full of myself
Yes, I admit to the Russian hacking of the "Hello Dolly" production.
They refuse to take off their head scarves...
OK.  Everyone can leave except for Nestasia.
We’ll get to the center of this crime family!
I suspect it was an inside, inside, inside job.
The littlest one, was in deep!
I just want to play with the dolls.
Blame it on budget cuts
The only thing I can say is, "Size matters."
Family Business", why do you ask
I thinking of calling this case, ‘The Silence of the Babushkas.’
Something tells me we're looking for an insider.
None of them look like hackers to me!
The ribs weren’t the same size...and I did have a shapely neck, once
Once they analyze my radiation badge,  they'll see there's more to me than meets the eye
Sargent, if we don't get a positive ID on number four with this line up, I'm quitting the force.
I don't know if I'd call it a type, but I do like a well rounded woman.
Individuality will save the world, don't ya' think?
Suspect #4 doesn't quite fit in.
You’re right—I’m just a shell of a man.
My wife thinks birth control is a man’s responsibility so maybe it’s time for a vasectomy.
Suspect in a shell game.
I just think that we're rushin' to conclusions here is all.
I can clearly place number four, but not so sure about the others
The evidence is really stacking up against them.
My inner selves are just not happy with this project.
They just naturally lined-up this way.
And your wish?
Rossetti, watch out for that tiny one on the end. Her street name roughly translates to ‘Souless Babushka of Death who also makes great blinis’
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to remove your head.
They all claim their name is Ivanka.
Sometimes I think a little man inside of me makes me do strange things
Is it one tariff or six?
Let's see how deep this thing really goes.
They're multiplying
All I said was: "The Weebles always wobble but they don't fall down!"
What do you mean, they've already spilled their guts? They haven't said a word.
No, I'm not hiding anything.
It’s the Bad Bushka Gang.”
ROOSKI EMPLOYMENT SERVICE
Female ICE Agent to Male ICE Agent:
"Okay, I think we've reached our quota...wait, what are we going to do with them?"
"Hmm, if only we can hide them somewhere?"
But you said to round up the usual suspects.
i just applied to e-harmony
I don’t care, I saw the big one eat all the  other ones
HR said that your previous comments were... unacceptable.
You think they're strange? Look at us
So...do you like kids?
The usual suspects don't have nearly the same shelf life."
But they all fit the description. You never mentioned hight...
Looks like an inside job.  We think the little one did it.
I can’t be sure—they all looked alike from where I was standing!
Ibsen?
It's more of a line down really...
This one's not stacking up.
Now that she's gone, I know it's not possible to replace her.  She was one of a kind.
Girls salty, boys more peppery.
Everyone agreed I would fit in here perfectly.
And that’s when I decided I had to get a Nest cam.
No. I will not give you a DNA sample.
I think the Russians may be trying to rig this one too.
I know we shouldn't rush into finding a suspect, but it's very obvious this was an inside job.
Yah, I have six personalities, so what?
She may look like a doll, but she's as nesty as they come.
Of course you don't see a problem with nesting, doll.
I was really attracted to the team player aspect of this job.
These are a lot harder to pick out of the line-up than the salt shakers.
Like peeling an onion but all I found at the end was a lousy $100 billion in laundered money.
I asked for a 6 pack of  O' Dolls .
They're still questioning the smallest. She won't crack.
It won’t work.
I’m just not into you.
What size clone do you want of yourself?
They were all covering up for one another, so I lined them up.
I 'm not sure which one so I took them all.
Well, we finally got to the bottom of this.
Moustache and pants got to go. And wear your headscarf! Next!
Yeah, I know I'm full of myself!
Looks like the odds aren't stacked in our favor.
So, you’re saying it was an inside job...
A little voice inside of me says "They're all guilty"
She was Russian, wooden in demeanor, but just can’t remember her height.
Same old story: a cheerful, decorative family gone bad.
I want a divorce.
Thanks, but actually they look a lot more like my wife...believe me, she’s a doll!
There is no inclusion; and even if it were, it is legal.
I said to round up the "usual suspects", not "unusual suspects".
Can you believe it? Six generations of hardened criminals.
Is your name really Matryoshka Hargitay?
It's our only chance. We can't make an ID off of fingerprints.
Oh no, I'm not doing this job anymore! All day long people keep pulling my head off to look inside me."
It's like they exploded or something.  I mean, I just made an innocent comment and suddenly generations are surrounding me.  From the smallest one to the largest.  It's like they had been holding it in for so long.
I assume this was an inside job.
This can't be what they meant by Russian interference.
What if it was the Russians AND an inside job?
These damn criminals. So empty inside.
I'm almost certain at least five of these women were involved in an inside job.
My gut still tells me that number six is hiding something.
Are you sure these couldn't be Russian spies doing an inside job?
Now that I've seen the line-up, I just can't be certain.
Nope. Even smaller.
They each claim it wasn’t an inside job.
They're all suspects on the insider trading case.
The nesting dolls must be identical  as they descend in size. The fourth doll on the left have cheeks . Fixit!
A positive ID, but I'm recommending a lesser included charge.
All witnesses identified #4. We're fortunate innocence coincides with rosy cheeks...
I'm sorry for having them framed, but they are my family even though they are also cannibals.
You've been dropping your g's lately... I heard "Russian."
Similarity? I don't see it.
What? We were told to crack down on the Russians.
If I hear one more,'the farmer & his six daughters' joke, I'm gonna puke!
Don't look at me, an hour ago there was just the one of them.
We think they're all colluding.
They tell me that some bullies are using them as bowling pins.
It took some time to get them to open up
I have this feeling there’s something inside me.
Go tell Mueller to bring us another matryoshka doll. This one's a dead end.
My secrets lie deep within me.
Maybe Mueller will make them crack.
Looks like the odds are stacked against them
Wow- you are stacked.
Now that we've lined them up, let's stack them.
Their parole officer wants them to wear ankle bracelets.
These are my daughters.  They are ll,9,7,5,3,and 1 years old.
We’re looking for a woman who can take her place alongside prior greats who have helped us develop our famous product line.
As far as i'm concerned, it’s an open-and-shut case of impersonating an officer.
Be a doll get me a coffee.......
We've been trying to infiltrate their human trafficking ring for months, but none of our undercover officers seem to fit in."
These are the ones who hacked our election.
Are these the same Russians busted for election meddling?
Which is the one causing the trouble?
Like every great crime family, they had the perfect hideout.
I like to nest too.
The DNA  came back. It’s a match.
We’re looking for a young female, average height
This was clearly an inside job, but I ran out of leads.
We're pretty sure it was an inside job.
They're all in this together.
Book 'em all and see who squeals first.
I can't wrap my head around this one.
You say, 'there are six or seven versions of me just trying to get out?' Show me what you mean!
Russians. They always have someone on the inside.
They deny it was an inside job.
The evidence is stacking up against me.
You were right, it's babushkas all the way down.
Some of the perps we arrest are so full of themselves.
It has all the earmarks of an inside job.
But I am the same man you married.
...I admit my experience with Tinder has been underwhelming.
For the last time, I'm not the inside man.
No, no, you misunderstood me. I wasn't calling you Doll . I'm mean they're dolls, right? Sharon, comon', they're dolls.
Personally, I'd eliminate the one third from the right.
No, no, they're innocent. But opportunities like this just don't come around every day.
Each one knows someone on the inside.
How many of you do I need to open to talk to you about which is your real wife?
They want to confess, but it sounds pretty hollow.
We have complied with Mr. Putin's order that he is now inside every doll set on the market."
I think it's gonna depend on how far our witness was from the crime scene.
Please tell me these aren't all yours.
They’re Russian Easter egg dolls that we discovered in Trump Towers. Must mean something!
It might be easier for the witness if we gave them numbers.”
They' re all guilty to some degree.
The evidence still points to an inside job!
Nope, still feels like they can see me.
The Captain is going with the Nestled Doll Theory so we brought in the Babushka gang.
The last cartoon I wrote a caption to disappeared from the website. All I have now are memories.
I hope the witness is sure, because I don't think the DNA will help.
What do you mean,I’m behind on child support. I never knew that I had children.
Next Halloween I won't let the suspects pick out their own costumes.
Our witness has identified the third from the left as the perpetrator,  so it was definitely an inside job."
It's damn hard to say who could flip.  But that little one, she's really been keeping her apron clean.
When I said 'she looked like a doll,' I really meant more like a "babe."
Number four is a spy we embedded with these Russians.
Hello, Dolly!
Toughest lineup our witness will ever face.
The paternity tests came back positive.
Gnome wasn't built in a day
Where do you fit in?
I’m telling you, she was there and then she was gone… Can
Diversifying with bobbleheads? Why didn't I think of that?
Have you ever wanted to live inside someone else’s skin?
I can't do it anymore.  I look in their eyes and just see my mother.
I may not look it but auditions make me nervous.
I think the right one is hiding something
I thought I might fit in
What? You never heard of trophy wives?
Usually, yes, but in this case I don’t think ‘Doll Face’ was out of line.
Thank God they're not all the same height.
You are perfect for our Costco version
I’m just the middle man.
on the other hand, how much difference could it make if they can't remove their headscarves?
It looks like this one might involve the Russians...
It is No. 2. She cannot understand Russian.
Nyet. Neechavo. Nada.
Sure, the rhyme’s imperfect, but I still think that one of these stacking dolls is our hacking troll.
Something's telling me it's an inside job
I searched them all for the murder weapon but all I found were other, smaller suspects.
I'm one of a kind.
Most of these perps have been on the inside before.
You think the mix-up’s bad for us? Picture Macy’s toy display right now.
Can you see if #6 is hiding another one inside her?
Stop calling me doll.
Don’t give me that “doll face” line
Linda, I finally made our lineups more scalable. Aren't you proud?
I don’t know what happened.  Something just took over inside me.
Hey, all the witness said was she was medium build, between 3'5 and 5'6, and we really need a conviction here.
Well, this explains the "getaway mom."
It's OK, they can all vote.
If I hear another  Ukrainian song, you are toast
Can you take it from here? This is hitting a little too close to home for me.
I wish you could see my inner self
I 've been lookin' for a doll like you.
If I hadn't lost my head you would have never found them.
I can't tell them apart, I'm colorblind.
Yes, FBI lady...I jumped & groped all those sizes...but that shouldn't nix me for the Supreme Court because I'm an far-right, Trump Republican nominee.
I swear I don’t roll!
She has been in a cell for three days, of course she is pale.
What makes you think I don’t have a split personality?
It helps me maintain perspective.
It was a closed case until she opened up.
I'm still not seeing any Russian collusion.
Please don't reassign me to a new nesting team just because of my gender resassignment.
I for one look forward to being an empty nester.
"I 'm thinking Russian dolls might give my political campaign a little buzz.
I did not collude with Boy Scouts to control Campfire Girls" elections!












\\\\\\\\
I was just trying to fit in!
To put it in a nutshell...
Open your mouth.
Now I believe it: What you see is what you get.
Trump hired me.
Hold tight.  The suspect is being brought over by the a-nesting officer.
Every day, I'm reminded of my five younger brothers. I can't take it any more.
The witness is nesting. Hopefully she can identify at least one of them!
Grow up!
Number one is our perp. The rest are fillers.
Something inside me says it couldn't of been them!
Inclusion.  But no collusion.
I think they’re hiding someone.
Witch hunt?
I may win a nobel prize for cloning, is that a crime?
You can't judge a book by its cover.
The line-up room is next door. This is the witness waiting room.
I'm sorry, it was dark inside. But she did have a distinctive mole.
How do I know they never plot with each other?  They have collusion insurance.
The one in the middle.
I'd peg Number 4 as the Ivanka knock-off.
These suspects fit together somehow.
When you asked me if I could assemble a line-up, I specifically told you I had it in me.
Vhat can I say?  Eetz nesting season!
I kept them all in the cellar
well you see the football team was in a huddle and I thought they were talking about me so I decided to hide in the woman's room
Matroska Schmatroska. What's wrong with Patroska?
I'm not profiling, they fit the description...
I’m sorry I referred to it as an in-nest-igation.
Okay, I reached deep into my personal resources to put this lineup together.
I can't hide it any longer - there's a woman inside me longing to come out.
They all looked equally suspicious
Good cop, bad cop? Let's just stack them--case closed.
Do these pants make my ass look fat?
How is anyone supposed to nab the real culprit?
I feel like there is more than one me that was hurt by her.
No relation whatsoever
It's a witch hunt, alright.
It's just a shame that our only witness is a guy that works the late shift at Toys "R" Us.
I am not convinced we have are seeing all the suspects.
Well, in that case I guess it was all of them?
I just thought Internal Affairs might would know what to do.
All of them have airtight alibis, except for one...
OK, so I have everything except the blushing cheeks and head scarf, and I'm the next size up, so I said I'd help them. There was never any mention of a champaign...or...campaign...or...can I just leave now?
Can you please just see where I'm coming from?
The Russian investigation is more layered than I expected.
Nyet. They don't say nothing, but I think little one did it.
Looks like Mueller-time. The little one was in the wet-bed tape.
Organized crime nesting dolls. Inside job?
We really shouldn't have let Ames design our line-up room.
Matryoshka? Babushka?  They all look alike to me!
I could've sworn that there was only one when I got there.
When you’re investigating the Russian mob, Lydia, getting a good height estimate from witnesses is critical!
What conflict of interest?
Trust me, it was an inside job.
As long as we're not rushin' the process I think we'll be okay.
You are what you eat
The DNA test was inconclusive.
After I fell off the wall, this is how they put me together again.
I encouraged them to let out what they've got bottled up inside.
So yea.....they all look the same to me.
And when I arrived home, she'd put all my belongings in a box in a box in a box in a box on the stoop.
How do I fit in?
can we just pin it on all of them and say it was collusion?
Hanging out with Trump again?
Listen , there’s a lot more to me then meets the eye
'I just can't figure out how they fit in to this..."
Time and time again, her modus operandi has been remarkably similar.
All matryoshkas look alike.
Don't call me Pyotr please. I'm Pete now.
In my defense, "rushing collision" is easily misheard.  Just say "hit-and-run" next time.
I know what you're thinking...I can assure you I am here just to admire.
I don't think they are going to open up for us.
The witness identified ALL of them -- was it because the perpetrator was running away from her?
What do you mean?  They look completely different!  Look, this is the South, they're probably distant....or not so distant cousins.
We need a new product. The Happy Dutch Maid is suffering declining sales.
One of them is hiding something. We need to get them to trust us and open up.
...Or, you can applaud my fidelity to the composite sketch.
I found the culprits.
I can't seem to find the woman inside me, nor the boy, girl, baby, or zygote. I just feel so empty!
I didn't know she was pregnant
Do you think it's genetic?
Yes, I recognize all six of them.
You’ve see one, you’ve seen ‘em all”
Told ya I could swallow the big one.
Mueller thinks it's an inside job
I'm beginning myself to believe it's number 3.
Mueller called about my Russian connections.
Officer, I can only see two possibilities for solving this case. Either the five on the left tried to smother the little one on the right or their just nesting dolls and you really should consider getting out on the street and solving a REAL CRIME!
So, I sez, "Look doll, Russian or no Russian, I'm gettin' to d' middle o' dis case."
My bad. I didn't realize the word dolls is sexist.
That's right boss, seems it was an inside job.
Number 1 was literally beside herself when I brought her in.
I'm sorry, this is the other Russian collusion investigation.
You have no idea how deep this one goes.
She did identify the mugger, but she mumbled.
They're mostly friendly, but I couldn't get the little one to open up.
A nice woman, yes, but she really needed a shrink.
I don’t get it.
Do you have any grey poupon?
How would I know she was Russian?
I know one of them is hiding something—but which one is it?
I like the variety.
Don't tell them which one is the imposter.  See if they can figure it out themselves.
Our tip said it was an inside job.
Each breakthrough points to an inside job...
I swear, I didn't know they were inside of me.
I think this one goes all the way to the top.
The evidence doesn’t stack up, Boss.
We had to bring in the entire Matryoshka crime family.
We’re pretty sure at least one of them was present at the meeting with Don Jr.
Well, the first problem is: the suspect was identified as a white male of average height.
Well, quite obviously there is a criminal element at work here.  Each of them appears self involved and full of themselves.
Are you still sure you don't have Russian relatives?
No matter what they say we know that they're in it together.
I don't know what, but something inside me made me paint it.
It's the old shell game, but which one is the culprit?
We have a tall order.
Just cut me open to see if there is another me inside.
And so the charges stack!
Why do I want off this case? Because the only suspect is my mother.
Most of  ‘em have been inside already.
I don't think they have anything to hide.
. . . But first I had to gain their trust . . .
Lineup is figurative not literal
These are American nesting dolls! Not Russian.
Good thing the witness is a circus height guesser.
Let’s add in an onion.
They’re introverts! You try getting them to come out of their shells.
Every time it seems we’ve cracked this case open, there’s more to the story.
For entry the head scarf is optional but a smile is compulsory.
"Don't even THINK of saying it ..!!"
I'm not guilty.  I suffer from multiple personality disorder.
They don't charge, and they're easy to store.
This job has made me wonder what I have inside me.
...and the mastermind behind it all is a matrioshka brain!
You think I stacked the lineup?
It's the one in the middle.
Make no mistake, our suspect was helped by someone on the inside.
What do you mean, eyes are watching me hack into their system?
Since it's a mob, I say we go with RICO charges.
The resemblance is eerie but no makeup might be the giveaway.
You can see that the suspects have really opened up.
I can't help feeling like we're stacking the evidence against her.
I’ve found these dolls after bring your kid to work day. They are totally not mine.
Which one is our suspect, again?
How did Putin get to pick the lineup?
Face it, we both need to lose a little weight.
I’d guess the smallest one.  It looked like an inside job.
What? No I said it was a matricide.
Believe me. I know their type. Just when you think you've got 'em, there's always one more."
I think it was the one with the apron.
I suspect Russian collusion."
You might say the odds are stacked against them.
Of course she complains about wearing hand-me-downs.
This one's a tribute to my mother.
I've always parted on the side.  Why do you ask?
Everyone tells me I fit the profile.
. . . . all of the above.
That's her!!!  3rd size down.  I'd swear my 4th smallest son on it!!!
Something doesn't stack up.
Wait, you said nest the russian dolls, not arrest?
I swear I'm not racist. They all look alike.
Is it wrong just to take a little time out to examine our innermost selves?
It’s a family thing.
You wouldn't think she had it in her to commit a crime, would you?
There's quite a bit of indigestion, in our family!
The nesting doll wearing a babushka did it.
I was told to look for a mule, not a doll....
'The one with the babushka' doesn't really help us, lady."
You know, Cagney, I suspect this is an inside job.
You almost stepped on Lars.
I'm sure its the fourth one from the left, as she's hated me since I removed her cheek spots.
Murder by Borscht?
The small one is pure evil.
These Russian ladies have agreed not to tamper with the November elections in the U.S..
It's the ones that aren't hollow that you have to look out for.  God knows what they're hiding and where they're hiding it!
I'm undercover...
...Comrade, I believe my adopted family, whilst they despised her, were entirely legless at the time of the alleged crime - so it can't be them who physically adducted my missing Mamuschka
Well, maybe Vladimir Putin is in one of them
What do you mean? Of course these are my sisters!
Trust me, Lieutenant, once we flip the first one, they'll all go down.
You can leave, I've got it covered.
We have a positive ID . The killer definitely did not have rosy cheeks...
I don't know what to do. They keeking coving eachother.
Ma'am, look again. Your complaint clearly states that the woman that stole your purse did NOT have round dots on her cheeks.
You wanted diversity I gave you diversity
No, sir. One size does NOT fit all.
Am I hiding something?  Nyet!
According to Mr. Petrov, the babushka that robbed him was a real doll.
The proof is stacking up.
Call the police, Honey.    They've stolen our boys!    Oh dear, I feel  so EMPTY!
She said there were many sides to her but I didn't believe it.
Look Doll, you are up for a peer review and it ain't gonna be just a rubber stamp this time
We think the leader is the one called, "Babushka" — but we can't get them to open up.
Why blow money on a hired model?
We just don't know which Russian colluded.
Collusion to illusion, really?
I think the one on the end is hiding something.
These are called Full Transparency
"Only the biggest one seems to be a trustworthy eyewitness."
My hunch is that a series of crimes were committed.
Frankly, we just don't think you fit in here.
Its the best I could do on short notice
Don’t sweat it, every witness is unreliable
I'm getting to the bottom of it.
Take all the time you need.
Sorry boss...I just don't know why I didn't fit...
Too soon?
I just felt like she was hiding something
Why me? Those things are made of wood, fire them. ”
Tell me you didn't call in the bomb squad again.
In my defense, this is what they get for allowing the kids to help with suspect sketches on bring your kid to work day.
Why would I want to get to know the inner me?
My inner child thinks it's number six.
Yes, I've been told that they take after me.
We can't be sure they weren't all in in it.
The one without the rosy cheeks wants to go to the White House.
I told you--there's no Russian cover-up!
It wasn't my intention to diminish women!
They do look like their mother. But fortunately none of them has her secretive personality.
You gotta use the small ones to get inside the big one’s head.
I hauled them in for microaggressions, micromicroaggressions, micromicromicroaggressions, micromicromicromicroaggressions…
There is no Russian doll collusion here.
You'll fit right in soon enough.
My mother said it was hereditary.
Unfortunately, their lack of arms rules out our fingerprint evidence.
We have a little evidence stacked against them.
I know something about crime nests.
What?  I'm just channeling my inner child.
She was wearing a bubushka that's all I remember
I can't stand it. She won't talk to me.
Your line of Russian Suspects. Some think it was the short one.
'Search the smallest one." "Well that's the problem."
There's something off with the third from the left.
Third from the right is a rebel.
You think I have a self-image problem?
Is perestroika over yet Mrs. Putin?
This is all a misunderstanding.  I swear I didn't mean nuthin' by it when I asked if I could try to fit inside her.
So you think we're all just dollies?
They’re not really smaller. That’s just foreshortening.
Trust me, this case is filled with twists and turns.
Looks like we have ourselves a case of multiple identity.
i'm not too sure we'll ever crack this case open.
The DNA samples seem stacked against me.
It'll just come down to who fits inside the profile.
It's not the size that counts, right?
So you're telling me we've lost track of the suspect?
Who you calling pinhead?
We had narrowed it down to one suspect
In my defense, Roseanne Nightingale sounds a lot like Russian Nesting Dolls.
Here's the lineup. See anyone that doesn't fit in?
None of these dolls were in any way connected with the 2016 election. You want to look at other kinds of Doll.
Not collusion, to be our next model you must become one of us.
I know I should be up front, but my gut tell's me all the action's right here. Like this case is going to break wide open, and I have the next clue: *inside* me...Crazy, huh?
Putin told me to remind you, send these to the White House, no return address!
Welcome to Russia.
I'm a real doll inside and out!
Smuggler!
I think I've been hacked....
I’m not sure who is guilty, but I do know that since we have had them in custody, the Russian Nesting Doll crime wave has ended.
Inside I contain multitudes.
It's not my fault they all look like *Borat Voice* my wiiiffeeeeee
The victim identified the perp by her hollow eyes.
Why does everyone say "Russia" like that?
Gary, I told you to keep you hands off the merchandise.
I can't squeeze you in.
I have a feeling we’ll be downsized next.
Don't know why, but they're like family to me !
Feeling a little beside yourself today?
Hi. My name is Julian. I am from Ecuador.
An inside job and both victims ID the little one -  it all fits together perfectly
For some reasons,I'm really up for some borscht.
We can't get them to talk.
Six more and we have an even- dozen
Deep inside,I'm just a little boy.
It was an inside job so it definitely wasn't the one your left
My money's on it being an inside job.
They all say I groped them while they were nesting!
We've been annexed by Crazytown.
I’ll admit they do look familiar.
All I said was, 'whoever one did it, she's a doll!'
The little voice inside of me says number six did it.
'It's a family tradition. When I was still inside my mother Motryashka, she sung to me a story her mother sung when she was still inside of her. It's a story of how to make money in Russia.'
Better get up carefully from that chair. It doesn't have the required five wheels to be steady.
How many Babushka Dolls does it take to change a light bulb?
I feel that I need to get in touch with my inner selves.
They're claiming no collusion...
Without any fingerprints, we need a solid identification.
How did you ever find six suspects who look so much alike?
The evidence has been staked against you Comrade!
I didn't think we would be so affected by the Russian Intervention.
A bit bland for Guccifer.
I think the Russians have hacked our selections.
We're trying to get to the bottom of this.
So which one do you think will take the fall?
No blush, no smile---always a dead giveaway.
We're ready.  Bring in the White House staff.
You finally got the Mom to crack
Instead of 1, 2, 3 just say Small, Medium or Large.
We don’t know how many of them were acting alone.
Don't You Think They Will Notice the Difference?
Look, I've never seen those kids before in my life!
They all look the same to me. I am sorry for you loss Mrs. Thumb
The other guys?  Uh, they just, uh, sort of disappeared.
So my sisters are a 'no go' as extras in the line up?
That was the last witness, Detective. No positive ID's. You still refuse to believe it was an inside, inside, inside, inside job?"
We caught them hiding inside one another.
OK, we rounded up the usual chachkies, send in Grandma to identify which one did it!
I think we can rule out number four.
We're checking to see if there is a DNA match.
Be patient, Karen, you know these Russian cases always have more layers to them.
Why do you think there's more than one murderer?
"Unisex version? We'll do next year, da."
If we just nail the king pin, we get the whole crew, it's a no-brainer.
Well no one told me we had partial finger prints.
Sorry, chief. New layers emerged before I could make this an open-and-shut case.
I swear I was not in Russia, officer
the Usual Suspects' Line down
Bob Muller thought this would be hilarious for the POTUS visit next week.
There's more to me than meets the eye.
It's unorthodox, but it's a probable twelve to seven that our guy's only doing it for her.
They told me I would fit in well here.
Trust me. We all fall down eventually...so will they.....
Better talk now! I'm the good cop.
No, you're the one with the map of Russia written on your face.
Round up the usual suspects. We’re sick and tired of it. It’s profiling.
They say they had nothing to do with the election.
Leggo my Mego?
I don't know how to book them, they all have the same name.
Our witness wasn't sure. You think DNA samples will help?
I think we’re hiding some gender fluidity issues here.
It was her...I mean them...I mean her...
Clever - they were sneaking in wood to beat the tariffs.
It would help if you have them wobble.
What's wrong, I just called her dollface?...
Nope. My children would be much better looking. I'm gonna need some proof.
Just spoke to all of the suspects; you wouldn't believe how full of themselves they all were.
I wrangled up all the known smugglers in the area
Are you quite certain that Perp #3 was the person that stole your Swingline stapler?
It's not going to be a problem. They're all Republican dolls and none of them can pee or slap.
OUT OF THESE PHOTOS WHICH PARTNER YOU LIKE?
This is a waste of time. These girls don't even have arms, how could they have robbed a bank? And don't even think about saying "Russian collusion."
I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest."  Winston Churchill.
I can't speak to the disguise used by my extended family...
They  ALL match the perp's DNA.  Ah,  hell,, I need a drink.
No, it was the presidential set.
The six of them take up almost no space in the luggage.
My friends tell me I am not unique.
I looked everywhere inside but we are still missing two.
Look, I'm sorry, but you said we were looking for Russian insiders.
Sorry, my wife’s side of the family never measured up.
I think we’re finally peeling away the onion on this Russian investigation”.



John Klotsche 
So. Huntington, N
No, Dianne, I don't know how they hacked us without hands.
I think the Russia probe is getting out of hand.
No, no; I'm single.  You?
I said shills, not shells.
The kids need a new outfit.
This line up will give the case perspective.
I just can’t tell how this case fits together.
I'm beginning to suspect collusion.
The only explanation is that each of them is covering for the other
No I’ve never been to Moscow.  Why would you ask me that?
Still guarding the Trump illegal immigration kids, Uh!!!
Do you mind if I yodel ?
Good thing we have that measurment chart.
You’ll be going under cover, deep under cover.
Don't you think we should include the suspect in the lineup?
Really puts thing in perspective.
I have nothing to do with Russian.  Fake news!!
There's been a mistake. We're looking for a petrushka, not a matryoshka.
OK, so you think I stole six dolls. But let's put this in perspective ...
Is it just you or all of you for the audition?
We offer gender diversity and the ability to stand on our own 12 legs
She ID'd the one second from left, but the defense will have a field day on cross examination.
It's clearly an inside job.
I’m pretty sure this is a case of misshapen identity.
They look so alike, I really can't tell which is Trump's mother.
Would you like to help me find my inner self ?
I don't see the issue, you asked for a variety of grandmothers.
I know we have to be "fair" to the suspect, but this is ridiculous.
Day 5, 2:45pm, back at the precinct - I knew the doll said it was an inside job, but now that I'd seen the suspects I could tell this case was going to be more difficult than I thought.
I think I’ve been here too long.
At least they won't be able to deny anything in court
As I feared, no one was able to identify the Russian who hacked their website.
Our all-women Collusion Team
Okay, you got me. Yes, the aunts from the old country were in town, and my regular guy downtown couldn't get me 'six matronly babushkas' for the lineup casting, so I had to improvise.
What did you mean when you said that you couldn't tell the difference so you treated them all as one
It appears they've all recently been in hiding.
It's the Revealing Your Inner Child workshop.
Well, we already elected a clown, so why not?
I'm sorry, mam, but things are not stacking up.
I have no idea where the other five came from -- do any of them look familiar from the arrest?
No, you can't call me Sergeant Babushka during this investigation.
I didn't know I needed a release.
Is it just me, or is this the best looking line-up we've seen in a while?
Were never going to solve this case Nicole. Number 1 says that number 2 is her Mother. Number 2 says that number 3 is her Mother. Number 3 says that number 4 is her mother. Number 5 says that ......
O decided to leave The White House and come back to my old job working for the Russians.
This is the most maddening case of cannibalism I've ever seen.
Their five brothers have nothing to do with this.
Let them go. The witness swears it wasn’t an inside job.
The Babushka in me is my savage wife"
Talieah Ram, Honolulu, HI
I'm not sure you'll be a good fit for us.
Are you sure you've got them all?
Experience tells me they’re in cahoots.
Yes, Mr. Weeble, I do see some resemblance, but I am still required to ask for names of your wife and children.
Don’t look at me like that...That’s how they came
Do you think he remembers her features?
Something tells me they were all at the scene of the crime at the same time. I didn't spend 3 years undercover for nothing.
I hate Russian dolls, they are full of themselves.
I firmly deny paternity.
We've had no luck getting them to open up.
OK, the contacts were Russian.  But they've all been taken out of context.
Well, at least we only have to question one of them.
There's a little voice inside me trying to get out.
Problem is they all look like colluders.
Guess which one is filled with bitcoins
Charge 'em all.  It was clearly an inside job.
This is only a shell covering my true inner self.
We picked the whole lot of them up at the border for smuggling.
Their stories just nestle inside each other's.
Honestly Chief? I don't think we're ever going to get to the bottom of this.
Don't look at me Nancy; you're the one who said to look for someone working on the inside.
I know they're smuggling something . . .
I swear boss, I only brought in one suspect and four more appeared from nowhere...?
You see, it's a family business.
And then they all ba-bashed me.
Okay,  but I have to be the lead Matruska
Now,What exactly makes you think I’m their father?
...And inside the littlest one we found three kilograms of heroin
But, she was a senior, detective.
First you brought a hollow, Turkish horse, now this...You’ve got to stop taking my metaphors seriously Greg.
Well, she was wearing glasses, so it’s hard to tell...
I think she said her name was Matryoshka.
Only the first two are mine. The rest were cloned.
We know your hiding something!
I think we are Russian this.
Don’t look at me Susan. My shift has just started.
Sometimes I wonder, is it true what they say about us profiling perps?
I wonder who she had to sleep with.
I just feel like they’re each hiding something.
They seem to know each other, but were extremely strong and powerful in their denials.
So exactly how deep does this colllusion go
It’s called diversity doll
"For what you're paying, what did you expect, the Rockettes"
What do you mean the witness said for the little one to step forward?
I promote them as man cave must-haves.
Well, they’re alleged associates of election stackers – but of course they’re insisting “No Collusion!”
The witness complained of blurred vision.
I feel like the one on the right is hiding something.
Hard to tell which one influenced the 2016 election!
Honestly, it was pretty easy to find the copy cat killers.
I feel like I'm trapped in the Matrixoshka!
Everytime we bring one in another one pops out.
Purchases benefit the Butina Defense Fund.
I caught 'em nesting.
Why no, sergeant, I don’t recall there being 7 suspects involved.
If we can get a positive I.D., 
I'm sure you'll be able to get her to open up.
Yeah, I'm an Amway dealer. How did you know?
Our stowaway could be anyone of them.
And that is the long and the short of it.
They all have the same alibi; "We were together." And, babushka confirmed it.
I fear my job has gotten a little monotonous!
You said to get more females in the line up.”
Sometimes it's hard to keep my head on straight.
It personalizes the data
No Steve...I said I was I "rushin' through Dulles AND that the lines were criminal"!
If you could only see what I'm like inside.
Yeah, see, what had happened was . . .
Why? What makes you say that!?
Welcome to our weight loss program.
Sure, I’ll be glad to take a paternity test!
Work on your neck and come back in 2 weeks.
Criminal masterminds are always full of themselves.
I don't think birth control is the answer!
I doubt DNA  evidence is going to help solve the case either
I don't see why you're upset...you said bring in some Russians, and these little ladies are all in cahoots.
I feel a connection to the people in the lineup.
I have a very inter-nesting theory about the case.
Deep down inside, I still love you.
I'll see if I can get one to open up.
I thought it would be fun to line up the family for a photo...
They're each other's alibis.
But you said you wanted a sequential lineup of the suspect.
So have you had one of those DNA tests done yet?
The odds are stacked against us.
I could never get to the real her.
We know the Russians meddled in the election.  We now have to get proof of the scale of interference.
My inner self is an empty icebox.
Can I see number one step forward, but from much farther away?
It wasn't I who goofed up. It was one of the inner layers.
The eyewitness said, and I quote, 'I can't be sure unless I grab 'em by the pussy' "
The story he gave was full of contradictions—it just didn't stack up.
One of these girls is not like the others. 
One of these girls, just doesn't fit.
Oh you wanted them a-nested? My mistake.
Maybe it’s all the coffee and late nights, but does it look like our suspect is slowly getting smaller?
I was asked to come up with a minimalist  graphics design  for our new   "A Brassiere for every Size"  ad campaign.
My goodness! Whatever shall we do with this terrible cartoon?!” - Everyone.
Sorry, but you’re just not like the other girls.
I’m sure Number 3 is dirty.
Trust me,the Russians had nothing to do with this! Be a doll and forget it.
This should be easy.
Their alibi makes no sense whatsoever but yet they’re still just SO full of themselves...
They all claim to be children seeking asylum but we're waiting for poison control to clear them first.
No, Missey, I won’t send you to Glasgow School of art, in Scotiamd, when all you care about is reproductions of yourseelf.
I know there hiding something. I just can't put my finger on it.
I'm having a real hard time adjusting to civilian life.
I  hear they're all empty inside.
There's no end... each time we probe a new suspect, another one turns up.
I don't know who's guilty, but it'll cost an arm and a leg to bail them out.
I think it is an inside, inside, inside job.
It is mere coincidence that my shop is in lobby of Trump Tower. No collusion.
Your great grandmother hid my great grandfather, grandfather, and  two of his brothers.
It's a living!
We may have to call Mueller.
They're better than trolls.
We'll need a microscrcope for round 2.
I don't know. I only saw the big one.
Sorry, you are not pretty enough.
The economy, stupid. No more individualism. I'm ready to join the crowd.
Still have no prints?
They ARE my “usual suspects” ... in cognito!
If the inspirational dolls weren't your doing, then who's behind them?
Collusion comes in all sizes.
Don't ask me why.  I've been told that if you have a dog for a long time, you start to look like him, too.
She's pretty much one of a kind.
I've had sextuplets.
Tell me truthfully. Where are you hiding the rest of the bunch?
Can you and your six identical daughters help find whoever glued my hands to my waist, and your hands to your thighs?
I don’t believe in stereotypes. And yes I think vodka is healthier than orange juice. And stop calling me Boris, my name is Sal.
Collusion or not this is stacking up to be a nest of trouble!
We talked about this...take down the painting, Larry!
Madame Agent, please to tell Mr. Special Counsel that the last and smallest of my matroshka dolls is not your Mr. Trump.
Alright, now turn toward pluralistic democracy.
we can fit at least 8 of you in there
I still can’t be sure, can they turn to the right again?
It does appear that my gene pool is getting redundant.
Something just doesn't stack up with them.
Well it was either this or the Fiddler on the Roof set
I'm gonna say it's the one without the rosy cheeks
Why did you order that lineup?
We are hoping #6 will be a boy!
No one wants to know what’s inside the real me.
What about #metoo don't you get!
Once more Oedipus dreams of Me Too waterboarding by the KGB...
Yes, I do think the ‘fillers’ are a bit obvious in this line-up.
And where do you fit in?
Dis izz my vife and kidz and ve are seeking refugee status
Yes, I am an only child.
Don’t stare at me this way. I will blush as red as the dolls behind me...
They all came together so does that mean they’re all guilty?
I'm nesting resting.  Give me a break!
I Told You I A'm Not The Father !
Now that we’ve officially become empty-nesters. I’d thought I’d be excited. But, now I just feel empty.
We can only help you if you agree to be the smallest one
So it's a whole family of criminals?
It's just a question of the height.
Well, now we know how Putin won the election.
They said she was Russian but not sure how tall.
They all look like the one who attacked me, but I think she was a little smaller.  Could you ask the one on the far right to remove her top?
I think it's time for me to move on.
The evidence stacks up to collusion.
can't tell them apart!
Yeah, just let them all go. I'm not doing this.
If I pull off your head, how many more of you will I find inside?
Your theory for this line up has a lot of holes in it.
Boss, you know I'm bored sometimes, but at least I'm unique playing matryoshka dolls at work.
The eyewitness almost got it right.
You said you wouldn’t use family for the line-up anymore.
Will it hurt?
They're modeled after my mother.
I need to get my eyes checked…I think I’m seeing sextuple.
Yes, they arrived all over the country. The note said to only open the small one if the Dems win in November.
Where are your younger bothers?
They paid for the ads in rubles...
You’re the one who told me it was an inside job.
I think the biggest one is hiding something...and the second biggest...and the third biggest...and
It's a tribute to Star Wars.  Which one do you like the best?
I swear I’m traveling alone this time!
Once she open up, she exposed her co-conspirators.
I feel bad. We should have just let them get away...but they would'nt run!
To them, it's more like a lineDOWN.
Bring in the Babushka to ID the suspect.
my word against theirs
Oh ... So THAT’s what art imitate life means.
I don't know.  It's just that I am feeling unfulfilled.
I am going to stick my neck out and say they don’t have a leg to stand on   Case closed
All but one are Weebles. Third from the right?  Not much of a disguise.
We have received signs of interference several times in a row.
This investigation just doesn't stack up!
She said she did it because of her empty nesting syndrome.
Sure I fought back, but like the rest of her family, they wobbled, but never fell down.
What? So I made the obvious T.S. Eliot joke. Big deal.
The 4th suspect doesn’t look anything like the others.”
Once again, it’s a matter of perspective.
Don't know, he said.  "All Russians look the same to me.
You know what, get me the glazed and the Boston cream
They're not talking. They want to see their lawyers.
I was gonna buy a nesting doll that I could call my own but took the plain but pretty doll that other fellows would not steal
My therapist told me to embrace my inner women.
From my calculations, they're not humans.  They're dolls.
When I start talking different, then i'll leave.
I just can’t explain this empty feeling inside.
Those sketch artists...
Boss,  they  look  like
legal aliens!
Look, I don’t hide my hobbies.
I like the one in the middle, but I wish she had legs!
No, but he did pick out the great-granddaughter's cheeks.
Collusion!  Collusion with who?
Why do I always have to be on the outside?
Relax. Once they wobble to the left, you'll see perp doesn't fit in.
No Ma'm I had intended to build these dolls in your likeness
They brought me in to do the work of six others.
But Richie Colton actually created 'I love New York', the silk screen isin the Museum of the City of New York, and this is the only way I know to get to an editor of the New Yorker...
If coincidences are just coincidences, why do they feel so contrived?
I've seen some cover up attempts before, but this one takes the cake.
We can work on your gender, but your arms and legs could be a problem.
Slow night, eh?
I figure it'll all work out until I ask one of them to turn around.
Surely you don't think I'm the inside man?
A little bird told me nesting is what it's all about.
A criminal's mind is multi layered - does intent lie with the outermost public face or are the darkest motives carried in the smallest doll? We need to crack this case - I told my kids I'd return the others before bedtime!
To nest or not to nest, that is the question.
Hmm. Now, I think the one on the right might be hiding something.
Let's just deport them.
I can't tell you when they first started disappearing?
Be a doll and bring me a cup of coffee.
Hey stop Russian me!
Size doesn't matter.
I can't shake the feeling that this goes even deeper.
Good job it won't be hard to identify​​ this time..
It grows on you after a while.
I was married to her for six years and always wanteed a boy.
THEY'RE MUSLUM, THEY'RE MINE, AND THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL
I'll never be an empty nester.
Really; my family tree is also a birch.
Two issues; its difficult to determine the suspect's height due to the suspect only being seen on a security monitor and secondly, the one on the left looks like my wife .
I lost my inner child
Out of all the the guys that showed up, you picked for the modeling job, wow. What won you over?.
I'm selling them on ebay and need to show their height.
No, Sonya, truth is complicated.
The clothing is perfect but I'm not so sure now, they might have had a beard.
Something tells me there's more to this case.
My dream girl: doesn’t talk back, doesn’t walk away.
My name is Boris, please note how my children stack up!
All the others will blame it on the evil inside them
Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka, Matryoshka
What? I'm and artist.
What?! The witness said, “They all look alike” !
It's a Russian trolls' lineup
I vait for tin person inside.
My inner voices are getting louder all the time.
Well sorry, but you're the one that asked to see the usual suspects for this Russia thing.
I heard admission was 6 for the price of one.
You say you've lost your inner child.
Can you get me 5 more of ANY of these for the lineup?
All the munchkins in the break room are missing.
What do you mean, I keep repeating myself?
First boy in the family,but feeling a little empty inside.
Well, I suppose the perspective argument might be raised.
All of 'em claim they were inside that night with their sisters.
You know it is illegal to have so many wives!
Feel like Nesting tonight?
I just want. I can’t love them all.
They claim their friends suggested a visit to Salisbury to see the famous 123 meter spire.
I feel empty inside.
This is beginning to look more and more like an inside job.
Now what are we going to do since they're all bots working for Putin?
Mike Starry, Fresno, CA
jmstarry@comcast.net
What are you doing here? Are you here to arrest me? I haven’t done a thing wrong, believe me.
I'm gonna have to recuse myself from this one.
The President drained the gene pool.
I can clone you too.
I thought they might be from the Snow White story but there are only six of them.
Collusion is not a crime!
Won’t work - no height given by witness.
What can I say?  I've got a type...
The evidence in this case are stacking up nicely.
I think I should change my name from Nestor.
I asked a few friends to fill-in gaps for the line-up.
Wanna grab coffee after I put dimple on #4.
My doctor says that I need to learn how to open up!
I continue to be suspicious as to whether I am the father of our six daughters.
Should we tell #4 to give us some dimples?
I'm making more of an effort to get into my work.
This job makes you feel hollow sometimes.
Do they make you feel like you want to nest?
We combed over that rat nest horror and found them gleefully busting the squat-and-kick move whilst whispering incredibly flattering things only a narcissist tool would believe at the height of self-delusion and the fullest diaper ever filled.
We keep trying for a boy, but my wife being hooked on thalidomide - it apparently affects the sex of a child, too.
We got a tip from an informant inside the organization.
I am not the father
She was feeling a little beside herself when we boarded.
So which one did it?
Perhaps, with a bit more hormone therapy.  Seven to eight more treatments. Minimum.
These ladies were running nested while loops when they broke into the code.
Only one stands out.
Russian nesting coercion
Thalidomide.
Oh, so you mean 'Workforce Reduction' in the literal sense ...
I told you this crew was the epitome of organized crime.
Sorry, ma'am, we don't allow inconspicuous criminals past this point.
Are you sure it’s Russian spies we’re looking for?
But I identify as a Babushka.
I told you I was going undercover with the Russians.”
No, it's not the tall one. We're looking at an inside job.
I'm sorry we're looking for someone only three inches tall
Yes, that's the one I saw at Salisbury Cathedral.
They were previously confined in each other.
The one on the left did it. You can see it in her eyes.
I just don't see how I fit in here anymore.
One of them has the inside information we're looking for.
Detain the littlest one.  Deport the rest.
You told me your alleged sex abuser said his accusers were all stacked up against him and that they had no legs to stand on
They won't talk one-on-one, but if I can get them all together, I think I'll find out it's an inside job.
"I'm telling you, six ate seven!"
You guys all look alike...
Stop playing with your toys at work!
Thanks. Want to see my sons?
Number 4 is rougeless and I'm clueless. Be a doll and take over this case for me, will ya?
I've lost the little woman.
Are we still creating an unattainable body image if our models are different sizes?
I have a new perspective on the case, but it's forced.
I'm not sure that's the best solution for jail overcrowding.
The dog sniffed them out.
It's an open and shut and open and shut and open and shut case.
One in six is not affected by nesting fever.”
Sir, is there anyone else IN your family?
Yes officer, the perpetrator is the third one from the right.
See if you can get them to take off there scarf."
Since my wife took the kids, I'm feeling like an empty nester
I hope the victim remembers height rather than facial features...
It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?
I suspect hidden intel, given they were mixed in with the Barbies."
You see one, you've seen them all.
So the lineup is stacking up
They’re all suspects.
What? Victim said they were Russian.
I don't care what the new policy says, I'm not separating them.
It's always the little one that holds the biggest secret.
Do they seriously have Raggedy Ann in the next room?
What makes you think it was only the Russians who hacked into Hillary's computer server?
This is stacking up to be an open and shut case.
Getting them to open up was easy; they thought I was an embedded Russian too.
They are suspected of breaking the law of diminishing returns.
If you ask them to turn to the side, they might fall over.
Are you sure they can't recall how tall the burglar was?
I keep coming to a dead end on the Russian Doll case, boss. There's no other way, they must have had someone on the inside.
Is that all you can put together?
Based on my hunches, every breakthrough in this case has yielded a new theory.
Why ask me?  I'm not hollow inside.
It's not racial profiling, Number 4 isn't nearly as jolly!
The Russians are not hiding nuclear weapons in there!
Do you think they'll be able to pick out Ms. Matryoshka for the crime of identity theft?

Janet Street, Atlanta, GA
They have always been women, that's why.
Amazing, your children were all delivered by C-section?
Yes, I realize that the surgery was a great success, but now I just feel so empty inside.........
Now, don't try to tell me they are all your daughters, Shah BabaGanush
I know.  Cute.  But really full of herself.
This has nothing to do with my pronnes to always blaim the Russians!
You asked for a headline that would intimidate the mafia
I shouldn't be rushin' to any conclusions, but it's like they know each other inside and out.
'With a haircut like this, did I have any choice but to do line up duty?'
I just kept diggin'.
I didn’t think this was nesting season.
I've uncovered the usual suspects.
We also know that her name is Natasha, if that helps?
The odds are really stacked against women nowadays, don't you think?
OK.....Let’s see you wobble.
Because I’m sure it was an inside job!
What do you mean, I'm too close to the case? I'm telling you, my mothers are innocent!
Good work , Detective.  That’s one crime family we can put neatly away.
How ya doin', doll.
We've come a long way in keeping up with the digital age, by expanding the sizes on our test tube babies. No longer will offer the traditional one size fits all.
Oh, I misheard you.  You mean you wanted me arrest any nasty gals I found?
More Russian interference in the 2016 election. Something about plying voters with pelmeni.
When the witness comes in , we'll have 'em one at a time say, "No collusion here!" real menacing-like.
It might be number 2, but then again it might be the one inside of number 2.
You clearly were Russian to find others to blame for the crime.
They're not all mine.
I said, I'm resting not nesting!
They're the suspects in that Russian wood carving caper.
Same old same old, you?
We have collected DNA samples from both the postman and the milkman.
We think one of them has an accomplice on the inside.
It's not what it looks like. I just admire the way she can fit so much inside her.
Well, it could be Russia AND an inside job...
I'm tellin ya, my name is Humpty!
She only said she was Russian.
You never what's really in a person.
Look, there were six of them and one of me
Now I know how Robert Mueller feels...
I said Russian tall, not Russian doll.”
Only the tall one saw something, the others were all inside.
It seems like the deeper I dig the smaller the result.
Let's try to keep this all in perspective
So maybe I colluded a little bit.
I do have an opinion. I'm paid not to express it.
I'm sorry if you think they look like you."
Does this mean I have to shave the mustache?
We’re training Russian gas station attendants to notice distinguishing characteristic so they can pick out the criminal in a line-up.
I think if we start with suspect #6, everything will start to come together.
Some parts of me identify with her.
I told them there was something wrong with the x-ray machine.
I’ll never forget it.
He was a man wearing red dots on each cheek
And he had a mustache.
Don't let their size fool you. The smaller they get the more they have to say.
Nest with me, Nastassia.
I know we're the investigators but sometimes I get the feelings it's us who are being watched.
No, you don't get royalties.
I got stuck in one once. Thus the shape of my head.
We were told by multiple sources that the perp had a real doll face.
I innocent of harassing. I was only interested in nesting.
They’re not talking...
Who's the eyewitness?  Ken?"
That was inappropriate, Sergeant. One of these so-called “dolls” is an axe murderer!”
I still think there are more members of this gang that are unaccounted for.
It's unfair to bring an entire family in.
Well shucks Judy - it must have been an inside job"
Nikogda, nikogda, nikogda! Got it! Never apologize, never explain, never complain!
What are you looking at comrade- I mean commander*
Believer me, this wasn't an inside job."  Mary Ellen Doyle, Charleston, South Carolina
I've been trying but not one has cracked.
So, vere izzit dat Putin said dzey all need rosey chicks?!
Any more secrets?
I’m feeling very boxed in and diminished.  I’ve been feeling this way for at least two years...no - about a year... umm...well, maybe a few months...at least several weeks...
ok, since this morning.
I had to sit down. I’m seeing sextuple.
Do you ever find yourself thinking "Twenty-five years of police work,and it has all led up to this exact moment in time"?
Say what you want about my dolls, you know I Putin more work than anyone else
I have a hunch it's an inside job.
Would you explain whatever you mean by, 'family secrets'?
'You said "one personal item". And yes, it happens to be too large to fit on my desk.'
Tradition feh! if you’ve seen one you’ve seen them all.
I am who I am.
The identification depends on the perspective of the witness.
What’s are you are doing here?
We started the list with one suspect. I thought I had the investigation cracked after the first
The captain's  pretty sure it's a mob inside inside inside inside inside inside job
The victim described the perp's face perfectly. The height was a different story.
We've stumbled onto an elaborate cover-up.
Trolls?! I swear I thought you said Russian dolls...
What? You said to investigate how deep this Russia thing goes.
What exactly did you expect ordering  through an internet add selling 'Cute Russian dolls' ?
The oldest would be the most steeped in crime but which one would that be?
I tell you, they are all in on it
Sometimes I feel like I'm a round peg in a square hole.
Every time we try to do a proper line-up, the perps refuse to open up.
Yes, I moved my chair. The little one stares at me."
I call it ‘Many-Mini-Me Genealogy.’
I think Number 4 is hiding something.
I don’t need be told I’m off the wall.
Electoral Security Unit
Call Rudy”
'I'M FEELING VERY EMPTY INSIDE"
I don't know, but some women seem full of themselves!!
It seems crime runs deep in the family.
Sorry, mam, but I'm not a nesting doll.
Not you too, Tammy. I swear they're all in on it.
I swear it wasn't collusion
Are you asking me if  it was an inside job?
You can order me on eBay, under ‘Necker’s Knob’
I  know this feeling more than you think... not having a leg to stand on, or never a bird in the hand.
I think the 3-D printer needs toner or whatever that goop is
Do you think our government is aware of the Russian influence in our lineup?
About the time I think police line-ups are getting boring …. here come babushkas running out of the woodwork.
I found them all hanging out together
I can't put my finger on it, Sue, but something about this lineup just doesn't quite fit.
My wife was beside herself when I landed this job.
They all have the same fingerprints, too.
One of these here Russian dolls is a murderer!
We will get to the bottom of this.
No, he was gone before I could turn my head.
I called you because I still can’t crack the case.  I still can’t open these things.
Biggest robbery of the  year.  Evidence points to an inside job.
Like I said, it's an enigma wrapped inside a riddle, surrounded by a mystery, with a conundrum for a bow, delivered by some guy named Vlad...
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
There's something inside me I just can't talk about.
We put the baby dolls in a separate detention facility...
It's going to be tough getting to the bottom of this.
Those tariffs.
My mother always said to find a job you're fit for.
I thought we would stack the odds in our favor.
They vehemently deny colluding. I’m pretty sure they don’t even know what collusion means.”
Your turn next, Dolly.”
They're beside themselves with remorse.
I think this job is beginning to get to me.
I think it was a mistake to name her “Little Miss Me Too.”
Kinda looks like we're tampering with the Russian selections.
Would you like to see what is in me?
Numbers one through five were hiding something.
Six pack? More like a six stack.
I only touched her so she could fit in with the others
No luck -- our witness said the robber ran away.
Just because they're wood they don't count as dependents?
I don't care if they are full of themselves, be hard on them anyways!
All they keep saying, no matter what questions I ask them,
is 'Охота на ведьм' -- 'Witch hunt.' "
We'll take turns questioning them.
One of their stories is bound to wobble...
But, I was really, really into her!
Which one is hiding the little one?
You can't use the 'I'm just a cog in the wheel' excuse.
It may not surprise you to know that our favorite food is onions.
But, Olga, don't they all fit the description?
Do you some in a different size, too?
I get the line-up, but I think she’s a MacGuffin.
You want to open them and see if there is any nerve powder inside?
Yes, now I'm an empty nester.
We tried everything but they just won't open up any further."
Freshly minted politicians for sale...
I believe our case will get stronger once we find their nest.
I said,' Dollface, you're busted.'
They were in the doll house caper.
I can't shake the feeling that one of them is hiding something.
I'm telling you Chief, this whole thing feels like an inside job."
This case has TOO many LAYERS! HAHAHAHAHA IS THIS FUNNY? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? HAHAHAHAHA DO YOU LIKE THIS? IS THIS GOOD FOR YOU? HAHAHAHAHA IS THIS THE JOKE THAT CAN GO IN THE MAGAZINE? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? HUH? WILL I EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH?
This reminds me of the time someone  was attacked by Sybil
I've been getting in shape for work.
Sometimes I feel like I'm missing something, deep inside.
My theory is they were working together.
If you can’t be ‘em, join ‘em.
Nope I'm an only child.
Please identify the last one you saw.
Eanie, Meanie, Mieni, Moe is not the supporting evidence the prosecutor was hoping for.
Clandestine Russian collusion with many layers.
The victim said she found herself suddenly surrounded on all sides. Now we know why.
Those human traffickers are getting more devious by the day.
This is the funniest one
Of course we know they were Russian, but what *size* was the DNA at the crime scene??
Let's just do it and be legends, man.
DNA history just came in on these gals.
You're right Ms Butina, the NRA will hide the guns in the dolls. And I like that badge they gave you.
Yes, I contain multitudes.  So what?
Middle part, rosey cheeks, babooshka scarf, pinafore; Yes.
But no height info.
Yea, but they are all lying.
Sorry, I couldn't resist her. She's a real doll!
What are you trying to say?
She rested on the seventh one."
The one on the left is just a decoy; we're pretty sure it was an "inside" job.
This is our lineup to identify the Russian hackers.
I thought it was ‘big of me’ to marry all of them, too.
They look to see Putin pulling the puppet strings.  They do not expect to see what Churchhill saw, 'a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma,' in other words the Russian nesting doll.
Each alibi depends on another's.
That's not a six-pack.
well...they like to come out and get some fresh air now and then
Is this some kind of a cruel joke?
I filed, but it was diminishing returns
There's a killer inside of us all.
The victim said the one that assaulted him had arms.
The one without rosy cheeks did it!
Someone’s hiding something. We’re going to have to do a cavity search.
They're nesting dolls, not ICE targets.
Now that we know it was an inside job, we just have to figure out how deep this thing goes.
I rounded 'em up in a souvenir shop in Russiatown, next to Tchotchkes' bar
It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.
I try to be Bohemian. I read Mayakovsky, I go to anarchist rallies wearing my tie askew, but no matter how hard I try all I can create are the same dolls over and over
It took awhile, but we eventually uncovered a sicko nesting tendency."
The boss said to line up the guise in dolls.
Why do I get the feeling you're hiding something?
Well, Humpty, did you think you could hump her for 6 years and then dump her without paying child support?
See, I told you epigenetics was real.
Did you ask for the suspects' height?
I know you are getting closer and closer and closer to solving this case but we need to move on.
Now I have 6 more dependents! Hello Dollies!
My mom comes in all shapes and sizes.
I like my dolls because I'm moved around a lot and they're easy to pack.
This case feels like it has multiple layers of subterfuge.
She said she had a nesting urge.
Six for the price of one!
I need a break, boss. I've had an out of body experience.
The witness claims they all did it.
I feel a strong personal connection to this case...
I swear I only brought in the won.
I was told to report any signs of Russian interference.
I am just the little guy.
I don't know where the other four came from.
This Russia investigation just keeps growing!
I have seen my inner me and I don’t like him.
Their all my seed.
The one on the is hiding something.
I don't know about you, but I think the evidence is stacked against them.
I have a lot more of those in me.
Honestly, they all look the same to me
I see your family is a chip off the old block
Babushka means 'old.' For you, I recommend bobblehead.
Suspect #1 told me his accomplice resembled "yo mama."
And they stack just about anywhere
The jury is stacked.
...and the Russians kept coming, and coming, and coming!  What was I to do?
What!!??
 I missed gender selection by one measly chrome’zone
Evidence of collusion.
It’s not what I meant when I said ‘let’s get the witness to front an assortment of dolls.
Detective Igor, I can't put my finger on it, but there is a certain pattern to your line-ups.
Find your spot on the wall
I only took one - the others came with.
It's a blame game.
I asked her how many kids she was hiding. That's a fight I'll never forget...
Have we stacked the odds against suspect number 4?
Mueller wanted our department to try a different approach in the Russia investigation
I think she was a little smaller.
I related to FLOTUS - isn't automatic exceptions for peoples like me?
You're a doll, I'm telling' ya'.  How would you not fit in?
No lie, Bev. I replace one meal a day with a delicious shake, and my waist goes from the size of this gal behind me here down to the size of that little lady at the end.
I'm manageable from the inside out.
I think I need glasses she seems to be multiplying
I have been gradually excepting the fact that I am related to the  accused .”
I figure we need to keep it simple for him: "Show us on the dollies how high up the collusion goes.
I will confess if you release them all together as a set.
The models are my wife and our five daughters.
It's not knowing where I fit that gets me. Whether I'm the smaller part of somebody else, or I have all these little ones inside me.
As a judge your personal feelings doesn't matter.
So...looking at the report...there is no discernible link between the suspects
In the gulag it's hair today -- gone tomorrow.
How many of them will finger Kavanaugh?
Have a look under my head. First one is my wife, followed by my children and the cat.
The chances of finding the suspect are diminishing.
You should see the last five.
Any further investigation will result in diminishing returns.
I dunno, for some reason they appeal to me.
I know you actually have a neck.
Sorry, you're just not fitting in around here
I know it's tempting, but not everything fits together so easily.
Well, the DNA test showed they're not mine.
I feel like if we keep digging we're eventually going to get to the bottom of this puzzle.
I decided to keep them.  Looks just like my first girlfriend.
Sexism? Next you’ll be accusing me of ethnic profiling and heightism too.
We just want you to submit to a genetic test.
female officer: "You KNOW something.. what are you not telling me Patryoshka?"
Patryoshka: *hides head in little hands, breaks down in tears
I AM NESTING AGE
Obviously the jury has been stacked against me.
It grows on you.
Do you think Vladimir will like the Melania collection?
Don’t you doll face me!
Listen carefully, Sofia. It doesn't matter that all 30 women in the lineup are identical except in size. What matters is that the informant ID's several defendants for this week's puppet trials.
I know they're too big for a Christmas stocking, but the Irish like them for whisky decanters.
My wife is a doll, but this baby thing is from crazy town.
She’s in there somewhere.
I was told by HR that I'm a natural fit
They’re claiming that they had something to do with the outcome of the last election.
You said to get six doll faces.
They have a one-child policy. One per year.
Talk about a compounded cover up!
I found the Russian Collusion.
They all say their just innocent  tourists.
What size is your wife?
I told you it was the Russia mafia.
How many times do I have to tell you? Size doesn't matter!
Ya but we're looking for the perpetrator of a series of crimes.
When we started dating she said she only wanted to have two.
We've established that it was a pretty crime, but exactly how petty?
I have inner child issues.
Ancestry.com told me I might find a DNA match around here.
We're supposed to be looking for a Russian crime family. This is the best you could do?
They ain't criminals, they're my sisters.
No,you can't use the women's room.
I am sure, it is the third from the right er a .. maybe it is the third form the left. Anyway she did it
My bride is in there somewhere.
You are so full of yourself yourself!
I really did my best to fit in.
We just got the results back from Murray Povich. 
You ARE the father!
Definitely Russian .... but there was an echo.
I just don't understand how they all fit on just one getaway scooter
I can’t explain it, but my intuition tells me the killer was Russian
The Mini-me revolution is here to stay
I never thought we'd get caught up in the Mueller investigation."
I was so sure we had our perp. The victim said she was a real doll.
...it's all relative...
When I said I wanted all eyes on me I didn’t mean it like this...
Listen, do not Russian to a decision.
Yeah,Doc. What can my wife Dolly and I do to have some boy babies?
We sent the littlest doll to a separate detention facility.
He was an ex-Russian spy, they say it was an inside job...
It's the Law of Diminishing Returns!
In my defense, there's no precedent for 'appropriate' behavior.
I can only recognize the one on the far left.
Hi! How are yourselves today?
They're Russians... let's just throw them all in jail.
I’m starting to think you may be right - it WAS an inside job!
Russian remake of "Child's Play" featuring the Chuckettes
Mary,Mary, quite contrary...
Your Honor.  I deny harassment.  It meant nothing to me.  It was her boobs I was after.
Say what you will, but it's cut down on all the hemming and hawing.
If you dig deep enough you’ll find Russian collusion!
So, in order to find my inner self, you are saying that I should take more steroids ?
The chicks in the lineup may look alike but one of them is guilty of pandering to those Christmas nutcracker dudes.
Where’s the rest of your team?
I don’t care if I’m nesting - this is my office Pete.
I just have a feeling they're hiding something.
I'm just afraid it will happen again.
I was made this way and it was time I came out of the stack.
The family. No daughters yet.
I told the surgeon I wanted Burt Reynolds and he did it.
Dopplerskaya Gang... the matriarch has nothing to hide.
It's definitely number three.  I'd recognize that cold, icy stare anywhere.
So far, no one has been able to positively identify the one that voted in the last election,
No, they are not my daughters !
Hmmph.
Is Russian party sign for Me Too Movement.
I  knew the suspect was hiding something.
It’s the Melania AI Exhibit. If you pull out your cell phone, they close their eyes and rhythmically chant ‘Be Best!’
It's obvious, isn't it? Look at her. All smug smile, blank stare.
I say we talk to the broad three from the right. Remember? The kid said his sister never wears make-up. Runs an international operation using her family to smuggle millions of dollars' worth of the stuff, sure. But never wears it.
The legs and arms will have to go.
I get frustrated when they say "They all look the same except for the size."
All of them deny that they were at the meeting with Donald Trump’s son.
They're Russian nesting trolls.
Hello reader. Imagine a funny caption about this cartoon written here.
Well, it's better than falling down on the job.
What? I was told to find a subject and slightly varying fillers... I thought this was a perfect fit.
You can call CSI, but DNA testing might not help us on this one.
Looks like an open-and-shut case.
Captain, I've figured it out.  It's the one without a disguise.
Ever since the inauguration we have a standing order if there are aerial photo ops.
Number four isn't sweating this, she knows the lineup is stacked against us.
This job used to be easier; people were different back then.
Today we brought in the unusual suspects.
Another Russian cartel.  They cover for each other.
Sorry, I can't look. I'm scared of heights.
How can you help me if all my personalities are exactly the same?
They fit well together--can't sell separately,I promised.
sometimes I feel like there's another person inside me
This goes all the way to the bottom.
Don't let the dollish face fool you. The third from the right is the killer.
Actually, I am bigger on the inside.
They just don’t seem to fit the crime.
I don't want to talk to those ego-maniacs. They're always so full of themselves.
Your daughter is the fourth one from the left, chief. We did our best with the line up to blend her in.
Number seven could still be hiding.
Great moves. Now do it without legs.
How do you say "dismissed" in Ukrainian?
It's for the Russian Mob case.
All these Russian cases are a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
Ya, Comrade. This is the gang of "children held" in that DC pizza parlor--Clever, ya? Trump loved that one. He doesn't use computers, but we told him Facebook was as good a place as Twitter to tell a tall Russian fable...

Yes Frank. It’s a woman’s world these days. Get over it.
Actually, they share a bedroom.
Go ahead, just pop my top and there are 5 others like me
You misspelled "Liars"
There's no telling what another full body pat-down will turn up."
I was a Mormon and then I became a Russian.
Their alibis keep emerging.
You have to face it, you just don’t fit in.
I don’t know what’s gotten into me.
Have you checked the smallest doll?  The missing smallest doll might be in the smallest doll.
The third one from the right got pale and stopped smiling when I mentioned the Steele dossier.
You mean the mic was “ON” when I said you were the “worst boss ever”?”
Yes, the line up did come from the Dark Side of the Family, It's been a problem for years.
Just because they're Russian doesn't make this fake news.
It wasn’t easy keeping it together.
They aren't talking. It's like they are hiding something.
They said Russian Bots- Not Dolls...
I didn't say you're a doll, I said you remind me of one.
Our victim said he'd known the perpetrator since she was a child.
Covert, Boris, covert operations! Your imagination sucks.
Jet fuel can’t melt steel beams.
No sons - why do you ask?
One of them is accused of is hiding something
There is no amount of rubles that can mess with my scruples.
This is the "Nested Witch Hunt" exhibit
That reminds me, are we having turducken for Thanksgiving?
Sorry L.T., I did the cavity search just like you said. There was nothing there.
and.
It's not my fault, you said, "line them up by height..."
Yes, I'm sure it was the third one from the right because I remember thinking she didn't look good without makeup.
This is very stereotype and sexist exhibit!
Only if you're not squemish, explore inside.
I've been doing it for about a year.
I don't want a paper doll to call my own.  I want a matryoshka doll closer to my size.
You are looking at the original Mazurka Man.
Inside I think I'm more women than man
I can explain, comrade, if you'll agree to a non-disclosure agreement.
We need one more person in the lineup. Go.
It’s a crime family, of course.
I know I'm sexy, but I have so much more inside.
I keep finding new things in this case.
Now have them line up in alphabetical order.
Most will crack under pressure, and number 4 has a cosmetics allergy.
Blame it on the Russia investigation.
They were subpoenaed for the Mueller Investigation.
I said something hilarious five minutes ago.
No, I'm a Weeble and I can't fall down.
It's  obvious.  I'm never going to fit in.
I asked her if she was able to identify the perp; she just said, “Yep!”
Male nesting is a thing!
What can I say? We fit together well.
Yes, but it works well in North Korea.
I thought you were coming back on Tuesday.
You should see what came outta me earlier today.
Well...?"
"Uhh...I mean, I thought she was just one!
Just why did you separate them?
Sadly, the evidence keeps stacking up against them.
Looks are so superficial.  It's what is inside you that counts.
#4 looks less cheeky than the others.  Let's lean on her first and see if the others fall in line.
Rita lost two pounds last week and I failed to notice.
I'm so sorry. When you said I was in charge of arresting Donald, I thought you said "Nesting Dolls."
You're scanning machines are fake!
How can a Russian man smuggle little girls across border?
There''s a little voice inside me saying "this is all a bit passe".
I feel it inside. They're all guilty.
I play well with others.
New undercover agent recruits.
I think they all did it - but the little one's the ringleader"
"We demanded he tell us which doll he planted the weed in
and to stop beating around the Babushka..."
"Five of them were in hiding."
Number 2 in the lineup...she did it!
I confess to MeTwo, Three, Four, Five, Six and Seven, Chief.
Its’s #4. She has such an unusual face.
Tell Mueller we’ve calibrated it for the Witch Hunt
I can't be sure,but I think it's a set up.
You're just not my type.
I'm tired of just copying my mother.
I knew it! You cheated on me and now they have committed crimes.
I heard it was an inside job.
She's a handful.
They may look innocent, but one of them led the collusion to nest.
To you they're dolls.  To me they are all suspects.
It's got me stumped.  Any ideas?
Just another day in Soviet Russia...
Is it me, or does this case just not stack up?
Why so glum? It’s not your fault the witness couldn’t pick out the killer.
Darling, I think it’s time to change our doll collect to Barbie dolls.
You can't open just one.
All we know is they're all hiding something.
I say your a Russian spy.
I'm sorry captain', I just had to see what was inside.
Looks like we've rounded up the usual Droste effects.
They say their orders to buy those Facebook ads came from Putin himself!
I just want to fit in.
I think this case has more layers than it looked like from the outside.
Sure
Nyet, only one is a genuine nester
I think our current profile may be too inclusive.
So you're telling me you only captured one suspect ?
Listen up, comrade. Women are not playthings!
There's much more to me than you think.
I'm starting a #MeTooAlso movement.
When you hear 'Russia Investigation', this isn't what I was thinking"
Maybe all the suspects are from the same family.
Linda, this appears to be an inside job."
It was the little one! Must've been an inside job...
What's this I hear about you not participating in the precinct's fantasy football league this year?
Oh, I thought you said fantasy line-up
They each have very different personalities though, don't you see?
Da, this is Trump Hotel Gift Shop
You’ll start talking when you’re on the inside.
Really it's just a question of perspective
I've had sex with them, er, I mean I've had six of them.
Make sure all my Nesters have a 5 o'clock shadow.
You can never tell what is inside a man
Look, a doll is a doll. What can I say?
Gender bias, Niet!
I think number one, but there's a little voice inside me saying two. And three. And four. And ...
The police say it's an inside job.
I’m telling you, Maam... give it time. You’ll be disgusted by what happens.
You’ll do. It’s nothing a babushka and apron couldn’t fix.
It seems that it is the Matryoshka klan... but no relation...
How tall was the suspect again? That mugshot isn’t doing anything for me.
Come on, one lap dance, they can't see us.
So, which one did you see inside Salisbury cathedral?
Yeah, I fucked all of them. Well...not the little one obviously. I’m not a creep.
I think of them all as my babies.
I have a sudden craving for beef stroganoff for lunch.
This is just another hostile work environment.
You're acting mighty full of yourself, Susan.
Everything points to it being an inside job
I can't be sure officer.  Things came apart so fast.  I could have sworn there were two more.
Believe me, I'm not keeping anything bottled up inside.
Captain, I think one of them knows where the real perp is deep inside.
The Russian one.
As you can see, I'm no off-the-shelf weeble.
What can I say, Susan? I found them all on Facebook.
It's going to be tough to pick out the cloner.
They're all guilty by dissociation, if you ask me.
What we’ve got here is a lineup of strong women.
These women are literally objects.
The witness used her I  Phone to record the incident, so the chief said to use the emojis.  This is all I could find.
Get Kate Bush down here, pronto.
The tall one smuggled them all in. They want us to separate the smallest ones.
On the bright side, this is the first time my family has been together in five years!
They told me they're not really Russian dolls, they just look that way.
Iggie & Aggie Egg:
Cheaper by the Half Dozen
You think this is proof beyond an un-reasonable doubt?
We're still getting to the kidnapped girl, boss.
Looks like they've reverted to their more recalcitrant,partisan stance
Book them for complicity, I don't care which one did it.
We deny any connection with Russia
My arms won’t fit.
So now you know, I spent my vacations in Russia.
The witness said she was a large Russian woman who descended on the victim quickly
It would help if we knew how far away she was when it happened
There was only one suspect until they frisked her.
Yes, I'm the Father and I nested with the Mother six times.
She’ll be rushin’ to pick one, but just tell her to take her time.
Our work is done comrade, we've completely infiltrated their culture  ... we went from prototype to the Kardashian sisters.
Victim said the perpetrator was a  female with a Russian accent. There were six Russian women in the toy store that day without an alibi, Cheryl. You can’t ignore it.
no i did not design and build these dolls to insult our government
so these are the russians  you wanted me to see have them turn around  again. ok they don't move well and they've all been stamped make america great again.
I got one of them to crack
The team was pretty advanced — they had a full stack.
I’m not your most stable employee, but I’ve never once fallen down on the job.
The victim said she couldn't recognize the Nesting Doll if it wasn't in its nest.
Lets just hand them all over to ICE to send back to Russia
Just practicing for when we capture the real Russian trolls
No Steve...I said that "I was rushin' through Dulles AND the lines were criminal!"
I was wrong, turns out there are plenty of folks matching the description... no arms, no legs
I always wanted a boy.
I stagnated in my empty nest.
My patients suffer from separation anxiety.
Come on. Cough’em up.
I know you're my partner, and I know I shouldn't have done it, but something just came over me and, all of a sudden, I was Russian to call you "doll face!"
One of these sick fucks is our Highway 1 Killer. She’d tie her victims to a car and drag them over the entirety of the 1 at 3am, when nobody was around. Usually we’d only find a few scraps of bone and a long red trail left behind. Brutal as shit, cap
'Got it. The big suspect stays. Smaller suspects out of the line-up for now but hold them.  Add five new suspects into the line-up with big suspect, but none of them identical to big suspect or each other. Size not withstanding.'
Because you are a seventh cousin removed from Mr. Trump, I cannot consider dating you.
Size isn't everything.
You see, I had to break out of the one-size-fits-all mindset...and that's how I got to where I am today.
They tried to get in on one ticket, but you can't fool me! My grandmother was Russian.
No selfies: as you can see the lighting in here can cause superimpositions.
My gut tells me the perp is hiding in plain sight.
I've tried to make one flip, but they all pop right back up.
How many times do I have to tell you. You can’t influence American elections with a Russian accent.
I know how it looks on the outside, but I think its an inside job.
She wore blue velvet.
The charge is resisting a nest.
Believe me, if they had legs they'd have your job too.
I arranged the suspects in order of height and collectibility.
The evidence is stacked against us.
It's what's on the inside that counts.
Yes, I'm certain.They all did it.
I never collided,I mean colluded,with any Russians!
Can you identify the suspect who hacked your computer? Don't worry, they cannot see you through the propaganda.
Whodunit? It's a mystery inside a riddle inside a puzzle.
Not exactly Pussy Riot, Are They?
Tell Lars he should be a little less abstract.
Uh..Phil, our witness revealed the assailant as being mean, and I quote, "I"guess you can say they lacked a 'rosy' disposition".
I tell you, these types come right out of the woodwork.
I'd search them, but I'm afraid I might find more of them.
And then my agent proposed "CSI: Matryoshka"....
It’s a Russian conspiracy.
I feel like this was an inside job.
It's strange, lately I keep having these visions of human kumquats.
Do they remember you of the current administration?
What makes you think I’ve been napping inside the dolls?
No urns or caskets for them to be repatriated in
I just know someone is going to say this is racial profiling.
I plead the seventh.
It's not racist - lots of my best friends are roundies.
Is the Russian collusion narrative a fantasy cast off by the dying brain cells of morally bankrupt, centrist liberalism? Absolutely. Absolutely. But we've still gotta figure out which one of these matryoshka dolls sucked Manafort's hog.
My perfect recall now seems like a mystery wrapped in an enigma
Anyone could have mistaken the smallest one for a buttplug!
How can you be sure there isn't a 7th?
It begins with me.
Their alibis check out with each other.
Do you think they're all guilty?
Guess who's the glitch in the Matrix?
I think this is just your basic insider trading case that the Russians have dolled up to look more layered than it really is
Russians know how to camouflage
You stick with what you know.
I think this was an inside job.
The one in the left was caught red handed. But this could be an inside job.
I suspect it was a man on the inside.
Who knew a whole a family can fit the same description at the suspect.
I sure hope to be transferred out of Juvenile soon.
Are you talking to me? Or mini-mini-mini-mini-mini-me?
Why do I feel like the Bods are stacked against  me?
"Can't we decide custody without hiring a lawyer?"
This is wayyyyy above my pay grade.
Okay Harry, what could possibly make you think this place is bugged?
Maybe we should go back to beating it out of her.
We're working under the theory that it was an inside job.
I don’t get this cartoon I’m in...am I the witness or a cop?
First let's put things into perspective.
Can we make this fast? I need to take my sister's family to the Empire State Building.
What’s your hurry?
I absolutely deny it. And categorically, too.
Sequences in a timeline or perspective of distance, your call
Dimples? Pimples? Whatever. I couldn’t find the rest of a set without them.
I heard the No Tranny Nesting Directive is being ignored over there . . so maybe . . ..
I didn't think anyone would notice if I took one.
So sorry, we don’t have a prenatal model!
I'm afraid with me what you see is what you get.
. . . and where's your babushka, Miss Perfect?
No, Mabel!  I told you to round up the usual suspects from the Eagle’s Nest Bar, not ‘line up the round Russian nesting dolls from Aunt Mildred’s next door!’
Six more votes for Trump.
We'll be back in business in no time, just you wait and see!
Looks like they weren’t fazed by your “Russia Investigation” joke.
Alright, I won’t ask them to take their tops off.
Hey boss! I matched that description real good. No way that perp is gettin’ off.
I can still see you. Now get back to work.
The middle one is just right? I'll pack up my desk.
You call these Russian hackers?  How are they supposed to type without arms?
Putin says I'm just a tourist.
The witness identified 'third from the left,' but I think he's lying.
Can you tell me which one of them enraged you, ma’am?
My other outfit is in the wash.
Yes, Eve's my wife!  All versions of her! She just likes to keep me guessing!
It's our new 'No Collusion' range.
Russian collusion dolls. Gonna need a translator.
Oh I promise you, they're all in here.
They all had alibis so we're back at doll one.
Your profiling is getting out of control
It's a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, but the last one was hiding a videotape.
You pick the perp. I"ll get her to open up.
I'm here to build a nest egg
Yes, they are stateless nesting dolls. You know, to ensure plausible deniability. How many do you need?
They said there may be a Russian nesting in the U.S. Presidential campaign, so we rounded up the usual suspects.
What? They can still use the guest room.
I don’t think she did it, but the big one is covering for the rest of 'em.
Another spy ring.
Sometimes I just feel so empty inside
'We can look past them being nesting dolls but since they're Russian Robert Mueller demanded we hold them for questioning'
There is no Russian interference in this selection.
I contain multitudes.
Please don’t fire me - I now have a lot of extra mouths to feed
If I were a richmam, 
Ya ha deedle deedle...
There but for the grace of God...
I'm a driving instructor here to teach feminists how to parallel park and change tires.
Hey, Bob Mueller used this lineup!
Forget it, Jake, it’s Chinatown
I kind of  feel I'm just another "empty nester"
for Russian Doll Combine #6.
She was the third one to come out, I’m sure. Or maybe the fourth. Or the second.
Remember the garden of eden ? 
A window seat would cost you  an apple !
They did not call it a lap top for nothing .
It is de rigueur for this museum to have some hieroglyphs representing our anthropomorphic progenitors.
I work well in a team environment.
I  like everything about the job except the wood part.
I’d like to audition my children on America’s Got Talent.  They are all under thirteen years old and have had competed in other talent completions.  They do dangerous Eastern European magic tricks.
We’ve been through this a dozen times 
How can you tell me that you are not related?
You should have seen them before I took over
I coined the phrase ‘descendant.’
No. 4 it is. By the way, blushing does not imply innocence
They look innocent enough, but they are hollow inside.
Well, there were 8 maids a-milking--- until all the king's horses came along!
Hard to get the prospective on this case.
Bring in the first Babushka Killer witness.
If one more witness says, “ka-ching,” I’m leaving.
A nesting security doll. What are the odds?
OK, calm down.  You didn't eat any of the gummy bears in the bag on my desk did you?
I told you, backup singers .
I guess if you’re asking, I’d like either a White Russian or Moscoe Mule.
You're such a doll.
After years of speculation, Jane felt like there was finally a crack in the case of who had been colluding with the Russians.
I'd suggest a little more variety in your inventory would boost sales.
It's all of them.
We only go off birth control once a year.
I’m not sure I’m ready to be an empty-nester just yet
I just can't get my head around the size of the crimes in this city anymore!
We’ve uncovered Putin’s new initiative: the Matryoshka network.
Finally, the last of the Russian spies
I could fit inside doll like you, Lieutenant Sachahobich.
Maybe one of them interfered in our election more than the others, but at least now we know it was an inside job.
I think they’re all in cahoots.
I have inside information that one or more of these women influenced the 2016 election.
What can I tell ya, they all have alibis.
They Told Me They Were on the Pill
Now, Mr. Rorschach, can you tell me which one is different than the others?
There my sisters from another mister"
For now, the non-disclosure agreements are working.
Redundancy is not a career path.
Yes, I am allowed to hang portraits of my family and no the postal employee manual does not state we have to reveal anything fragile, liquid, perishable, or concealable like multiple versions of ourselves decreasing in size.
I hate just putting her on a shelf but...
They passionately insist their innocence, but it feels hallow to me.
Take any one of them for your kid and let me go.
I miss Obama
One of them is definitely Keyser Soze!
But I got away with it for so long
I can't get the little one to open up, but I think Russia's involved.
They say I belittle them.
I'm tellin' the truth, I ain't hidin' nothin'
I like to get to know the inside of a woman
Why shouldn't they all look like Mom?
I never touched the little ones, I swear.
I am not sperm donor 4782.
You are not my type.
Oh those? Confiscations. Immigration protesters!
How long before I lose my limbs?
If dogs could fly - I'd be in another line of business.
it's # 7, I am sure as I am looking at you
They all look guilty.
It's number 2.
No, no. 4.
No,...
Sorry Sarge, but I just couldn't get their fingerprints.
The lawyer said we were Russian her client
I simply can’t sell them. This batch must have been made in reverse.
But sweetie, I’m going to leave my wife and family. I’m being honest. I promise
You’re positive she was wearing a scarf?
there is no Donald Trump inside me
Wanna nest?
It was my client who instructed me to write the six separate checks for $230,000 each.”
So, you have no affiliation with Russia? And what about the wall, Mr. Dumpty, what about that one?
I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I put ten dollars on the one with the bonnet.
It's standard operating procedure in the  'me too' movement not to lead the witness or stack the evidence in favor of the accused.
My girls wanted a collusion theme for our Christmas photo.
We've got sales in sales in sales in sales in sales in sales
They're the only Press Secretary applicants who kept a straight face when we told them what they'd be saying.
On the maternal side, the DNA test shows all clones.
What? The witness is fuzzy on the perp's height.
We're on a roll!
I’ve been living my whole life hidden. It’s all coming out, doll by doll.
So, the thief stole cosmetics.
Trust me, we’ll get to the bottom of this.
I have a feeling deep down inside that we’re never going to catch this one.
I have to confess, I was hoping there would be one more.
This one did it, that one did it - sounds like a case of 'nested ifs' to me.
They say they'd like to speak to Christopher Steele.
I only requested the case because I thought the sergeant said 'Russian mole.' "
Our theory is that it was an inside job.
Be patient. The answer is in me.
We suspect it was an inside job, but we haven't any proof it's linked to Russia.
Some of these criminals, you'll learn, can be really full of themselves.
And, then, she begat...
It's a family business. My great-great-great-grandmother Matryoshka designed them. It's in my blood.
One of them swallowed the evidence. I don't get paid enough for this.
these dolls will rush ya
First there was one, then two then three and when it got to six I got the hell out of there
Sir, I'm afraid you don't fit in here."
This lineup looks like an inside job
So torture me. I tell you I'm not a Matryoshka!
The one in the middle definitely stuck gum under her desk.
This suspect is so full of themself; I've finally got them to open up
Hey, don't look at me! I just asked the subject to try to contain herself.
I'm looking forward to the Olympics.
This  will be interesting trying to get finger prints from dolls who have none, you want to give it a shot?
Chief is looking for the culprit.
this is a news station not a Russian doll  store
The new ones are internet capable.
Unless our witness id's the shortest one, we will most likely still be looking at the "it was the demon inside me" defense...
So you say you don't know Matryoshka?
Hey, it was the 90's.
Bob Mueller told me this might crack the case, but all I found was a doll
The winner:  uniformity meets predictability.
Natasha, of course they all look the same.
The other side is asking for a paternity test.
Which one looks the least likely to open up and tell the truth?
I think I know why the boss assigned me to the Babushka doll show but you don't quite fit the mold.
No, really, I wouldn’t mind if you wear the pants in our relationship.
All I'm saying is I wonder what it's like to be inside 5 women at once.
Why  does everyone say "Gesundheit" when they walk by?
You’re never going to believe where we found number 6.
He had stared long and hard at the photo,I'm not too dissimilar. Did I get the job?
Yes officer, we’re ALL polygamists.
I think she has multiple personalities
Frankly, it looks to me like an open and shut case.
I'm mullin' a ruse of rouge.
Please have intelligence find out why these were sent to me...
I just don't fit in around here anymore.
I didn’t realize my wife had it, I mean...them, in her.
Good work catching the Russian Doll gang. Now the only thing they'll be stacking is jail time.
It's the most elaborate inside-job we've ever investigated,..... but she forgot one simple detail
Crimea a river
You're just too big to make number seven, plus you're hairdo and clothes are all wrong!
I just can't sell them.  They're like my own children.
Lars, you’re fired, this weeks comic was terrible
Nobody wants to be the next size up
So then I asked her, "what are you hiding?"
And the title of your next book will be: “How to Transition from Russian to Republican in Six Easy Steps.
I see you need to rush out; you'll see it looks like a Russian.
Is it for all  six sittings statues or just one?.
i`m just an empty shell of a doll
Your inner self has many hidden parts.
I think the odds are stacked against us here.
Of course Frank can take you to a nicer lunch place than I can. He guards the Hummel wing.
I've got a hunch suspect 6 is hiding something.
They're not as innocent as they look.
You say that you are the father of all of them
Number 4 could use a little rouge.
No, Detective, I will not get in the line-up even though I look like a nesting doll.
They say they are showing their right to be individuals.
Look Karen I was told to bring in ALL possible suspects, OK?
Da, we are a a Russian family of  Matryoshnas, but we are not spies! Do not deport!
The wait is actually longer than you'd think.
It has to be Mom, this is NOT a inside job.
It is a little man with headphones in last doll saying "No collusion".
It started out so small.
I'm worried we're Russian to judgement.
Yeah... we lost the little one. Like something just scooped her up.
I've got a funny feeling they're hiding something.
What exactly is that when it's at home? A perp walk or Craigslist??
The Leeds are getting smaller
I don't see any collusion.
How do you think I’ll stack up?
Pictured Above: God designs man in his own image. (Genesis 1:27)
"Unfortunately, there were no fingerprints left at the scene of the crime, Mr. Smith. Concentrate on the suspect's distinguishing facial features."
They all. say "it's fake news."
My sisters. Now you know why I tried to become a Russian oligarch.
I dunno she kinda- - you know- - -disappeared!
I know it looks just like the last lineup, but this Russian troll conspiracy goes deeper than we thought.
the baby is the Russian spy, but the big one is Putin it up so I had to move.
They all said they wanted to be up there!
Sometimes I just feel, I don’t know, like the real me is locked away deep inside!
Molls...I said "Gimme a lineup for arresting Russian molls."
And you thought the two midgets in a trench coat was weird.
Just give me a chance, and I won’t let you down. I can feel it inside of me.”
Oh Hi boss, I am just sitting down to watch these dolls so they won't get stolen. It is not like I am just sitting down an relaxing. Really
Hey, I tried, but everywhere I looked...
Our source says it was a Russian insider.
Am I a guide or part of the exhibit?
We make do with what we've got in this department.
What part of doll Russian female did I misunderstand?
I said six EVIL dolls!
Sing? No we're still working on getting them to talk
Oh, it's nesting, not resting?
I was Russian to find the suspects and Nesting you know...
They all rebound from every knock-down.
I’ve seen suspects with split personalities before, but nothing quite like this.
Now take your time and remember, you can see them, but they can't see you
Looks like we have another cover up!
This big case you said this was just keeps getting smaller and smaller. We're so close, goddamnit!
The little one keeps shouting-"NO COLLUSION!"
Can you ask the one second from the right to hop to her left
They're suspects in a Russian conspiracy
Could number three turn to her left?
There’s no case to pursue here.  It’s just another ‘he said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said.’
It's time we had a Ken doll of our own...
Can we say that babushka is a gender-neutral word?
You should stop taking your naps in the nesting dolls!
The big one claims it’s an inside job.
I just wanted my very own valley of the dolls.
They were found rushing to hide a whole nest of coke."
On behalf of the "'Womanhood is thy reward" committee we demand that you stop broadcasting or selling on air those nesting dolls that do not promote ethnic engendered diversity.
They say their Russia’s Ocean’s 6...
I don’t know, Sarge. It’s like there’s this nest of crime that keeps revealing hidden layers. By the way, these giant dolls are creeping me out.
The description we have works. We just don't know the height.
I hope we got the right person because they all look like “PODsible” suspects
The line up needs people who look more like the perp.
It's the Russian in me.
If we keep up the pressure, one of them is bound to cave.
Well, one thing's for sure- the victim is definitely not an American doll.
Yeah, apparently the whole family was in on it; it's a real mare's nest.
This isn't what Mueller meant when he said our suspects were the protagonists of ‘Russian Dolls 6?!'
They got touchy when I asked them to sing 'Edelweiss.' Apparently, they're not Austrian.
My nested daughters and wife won't disturb us..they've been silenced.
It’s Janet.  Miss Jackson if you’re nesty.
I'm sorry, sir, but we're all out pf your sizes.
Let ‘em go. Their alibis is all match.
The resemblance is purely coincidental.
They make feel so empty inside!
Don’t worry immunity is very fashionable these days
They are worried that Mueller's Russian inquiries will be stacked against them.'
They were all married to Russian leaders.
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.
The big one is hiding something, I'm sure of it.
I swear, I am the Step-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad.
They never taught me how to make boy dolls.
I would put you on a pedestal - not a shelf!
Of course the lineup's suggestive, cold blooded killers like #4 don't have adorable little rosy cheeks.
I can't tell, can you ask each of them to hold up a cup of cocoa, that would help.
Evil’s always wishing
Every time I speak I hear echoes as if I were hollow.
Putin gets more diabolical every day.
Third from the left has the cold eyes of a killer.
Do you think the lack of freckles is leading the witness?
There’s…there’s no one left. If it was a parasite — as these skin ruptures would indicate — it seems to have infected then burst en masse from the entire population at once. But why would the bodies be lined up here, outside the church? Unless…
You are right. They are not the usual suspects
I'm telling ya, Smith, one of these things just ain't like the others.
You did say the victim was attacked by a weeble didn't you?
Incredulity aside, these six are responsible for worst crime wave this city has ever seen.
At least we know we got the right person
Once you pop, you can't stop
You should see the Putin-themed Babushka dolls in the line up in Interview Room B.
I am certain we can now market The Trump Russian Nesting Doll Series!
I don't care if they do keep coming back for more, It's still physical abuse.
I'm afraid I just can't say with certainty—the woman who made me strudel was a bit taller than number two, but plumper than number one, and she had longer arms
don't talk to me or my daughters ever again
Russian influence or not, this has your D.N.A. all over it.
Unfortunately my dick is in the last one!
Solving a crime is like peeling an onion, in this case we were lucky, the perp was Russian
The short guy picked the one on the left and the tall woman picked the one on the right.
Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to lose the beard.
I happened when a Y was mistaken for an X...
I'm sure that a different set of dolls took my wallet.
No, I 've never met any of them. This is the first time I 've met Dolly,Polly,Nolly,Jolly,Solly and Miss Molly.....ever.  Really!
At least they're happy to be probed.
No collusion!
You can take over the business and be our agent in D.C., but you've got to work on the cheeks and smile.
Yes, is Russian version of your inflatable doll.
I see no evidence of Russian collusion.
I suspect the unsually rounded.
This looks to me like an inside job.
'Sure, the whole thing stinks, but how are are we going to prove collusion?'
No Russian interference here, I promise.
They have to be nesting some sort of crime ring
I am mama's boy!
Mueller has shut me down.  He says they are colluding.
Who knows how deep this Russian crime syndicate goes.
Mom told me I broke the mold.
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
Are you going to annest me?
I swear,the sisters all look alike...
My wife
I'm just hoping the victims will level with us.
Technically it was all of them...
It’s starting to look like an inside job.
Wobble forward number three.
I think there is some collusion on your behalf  Officer Putin.
You're right - size matters.
Every time I try to get to the bottom of this case, I keep finding another layer.
The one without the rosy cheeks looks suspicious.
The further I go with this case, the emptier I feel inside."
Clearly collusion. 3rd from the right is from the Ukraine.
It was definitely her. She’s full of herself and seems likes she’s Russian to get out of here.
Yeah - that’ll fit
It looks bad but I know they're innocent, they were nesting with me the whole time.
You really want me to open up and reveal my feminine sides?
I could make a doll that looks like you but will it sell?
It took my best interrogating, but she cracked eventually
I swear by the five in my unscrewed head that I loved each of her!
This looks like an open and shut case.
I can't escape the feeling that this was an inside job
It seems we have a big Russia problem on our hands.
Send one dollar and a sase and i will answer any question you have on any subject.  Send to 1141 1st  Avenue Ottawa,Illinois 61350...             Do you think my beard is nicer than Alex Trebecks?
We may appear similar on the outside but not everyone fits in perfectly on the inside.
Mary, this micro managing is getting out of hand.
It will probably be an inside job.
It’s a very strong gene pool.
I wanted a son....
I'm here to break the glass ceiling.
I have a hunch we can trace this back to Putin.
Looks to me like it was an inside inside inside inside inside job.
We haven't found the stash yet.
The usual suspects, per Mueller.
It's number three, definitely, number three!
The suspect is Russian and .
STEREOTYPED OR NOT, I AM BORED TO DEATH WITH MAKING THESE DUMB RUSSIAN DOLLS"
They say ‘Life imitates Art.’ But I just don’t see it.
Bobble Baby?
Trust me, these gals have been hiding something.
Our daughters will be very happy when their arms and legs arrive.
I take it that'll be an Orange Julius with a Smirnoff chaser.
I believe that we are dealing with a multiple personality disorder
Of course I know the difference between a babushka and a handkerchief."
Yeah, the surgery will be tough, but I've gotta be true to my inner selves.
We discovered the rest of her gang during a strip search.
From my perspective, this case is relative.
What makes you think they were colluding?
It could be worse.  It isn't infinite regress.
Sure Fed Ex can deliver, but there ain't no rushin' my nesting dolls!
I swear, I never knew their mother.
Sorry, I thought you said a line-up of SIX dolls.
Trump came by and commissioned these.  He said he's sick of giving his granddaughters American Girl dolls.
What can I say?  Fraternal sextuplets.
We know the culprit already. So - at least these are NICE!
"Have you been colluding with Russia?"
They are the same. It must be a glitch in the matrix.
Is the Trump/Putin set ready yet?
The evidence points to the Russians, but the White House insists it’s gang related.
It all started as a failed smuggling plot.
Don't be fooled by appearances. The littlest one is the craftiest.
I need to take a break and nest here for a spell.
I want to take a paternity test.
Third from the right has no freckles. Why?!
All Russians accused of election tampering came forward but said it left them feeling empty inside.
I can't quite put my finger on why I think this, but none of these seem like our perp.
I'll add legs to the big one and you'll have a center for your basketball team.
They're empty nesters now.
I distinctly remember you saying "Round up some similar looking Russian figures". You never said "people".
It looks like you've been working overtime.
So you are saying the witness saw the suspect in her rear view mirror?
It's late.They're all good girls, detective, of that I can assure you.
Yes, I DID try to influence the collections
i cant find a partner  to dance with
Don't ever talk to me or my harem of wives again.
This gang is going to be a tough nut to crack, we need someone on the inside
My gut tells me we should let them all go.
Look, Detective, I said organize a line-up for a nest of Russian thieves. You give me this.
This is one of the toughest ID lineups ever— and not a single fingerprint at the crime scene.
Looks like Russian interference to me.
After we got the entire gang, now the witness is changing the story.
Don't worry we got her DNA.
But darling, I'm just a shell of my former self.
Obviously this is our little secret.
What part of ‘tall Russian female’ did you not understand?
Did the cavity search reveal anything?
I don't need to go home again, I'm already there.
They all look alike to me. Does that make me a bad egg?
Sorry  I ripped your sisters head off, I just assumed....
Come on Stan, you know our policy on Russian into things
We need to stop russian our suspects they keep dividing
The Tiffany egg is still missing, Captain.  I don't feel right probing any further.
I want an inclusion rider.
Well let's just forget about this stupid case and go get some doughnuts because that is the police officer stereotype
Nora!”
“Yes Torvald?”
“This time I’m leaving; you keep the children!”
I think the Russians are behind this as well.
You try. At least I got her to open up.
Be careful of the one on the left, she was really full of herself earlier.
Everyone always blames the Russians
You said you wanted fillers that looked like the suspect!
This is why height is part of the suspect's description.
I never said empty nester? I'm telling you I don't
them...or their mother.
I dunno. What would Dick Wolf do?
Must have been collusion.
Witness swears he only saw one - the tallest one.
I'm available in other sizes.
im tellin ya, its some kinda shell company scam
I bet that ball of yarn on your head would look great on a Matryoshka Doll.
Russian fake news.
Did you check inside them to see if your brothers were there?
Bring in the bowling pin witness.
The eye-witness said they were all in on the heist and the tall one was the getaway vehicle.
All six deny any knowledge about Wikileaks.
“You want proof of Russian collusion? That’s SIX women pretending to be ONE.”
I’ve had better luck with onions.
They locked me in one of the dolls for a year so I could "get to know the product."
Please have number three and four step forward.
I've got a bad feeling about this I D parade  -- let's talk to the suspect's lawyer first
Well, I think the small one is hiding something.
It's the Matryoshka without the makeup that did the poisoning.
I feel like all these years on the force are making me lose my perspective, chief.
We've got it narrowed down between the one on the far left, and the one on the far right.
This case is open and open and open and open and open and shut and shut and shut and shut and shut.
I'm transitioning
I swear to you, I'm not in the cloning business.
I know my rights. My head is not going anywhere.
They're the Russian Collusion dolls --
Just like the evidence, they stack up neatly
It's that damn #metoo
Ask as often as you wish; my answer is the same: no one in my family has a neck.
I was nesting with the rest of them.
It’s what’s on the inside that matters.
I just can’t help but think that I should be in there with them.
So, what are you insinuating?
Why?  Because I'm trying to be in touch with my inner woman.
This is not the first time Putin has tried to interfere in American politics, but it may be the dumbest.
I think they're hiding something inside.
Now that you mention it, you do look like Jane Leeves.
What do you mean there should be "one" more in that line up.  Take it from me, I just know.
There was NO collusion, doll!
What is this 'identical politics' I keep hearing about?
I won't nest until justice is served.
Can't talk now, I'm rushing to get this order done!
There are a lot of layers within the Russian mob.
Is forced perspective still a crime in this city?
Of course I’m in touch with my inner self.
Same ol' craft show, Marge. My daughter thinks I should paint my matryoshka as ballerinas and call the series #MeTuTuToo. Might work.
THEY ALL HAVE SUSPICIOUSLY SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE THAT NIGHT.
It's like hackers inside of hackers. We won't have a solid suspect until we get deeper inside the operation.
Curse you!  You noticed the family resemblance.
Personally, I think they're all guilty except for one.
I'm resting - R-E-S-T-I-N-G. Resting.
Now John, you can’t keep letting your inner child out on every case like this
Matryoshka did it.
You know the drill-- shave the moustache, don the babushka and get in line-- I promise I won't tell anyone you are the model for the Matryoshka Nesting Dolls.
No, the two-faced one is not Vladimir!
If they can't ID the perp, we can't confirm the collusion.
I called you....they won't let me leave....
The Russia investigation manifests in your local cop shop.
What’s wrong with a line-up with a little gender parity?
I know they're matryoshka dolls, but women of every size are all the same.
The allegations are stacked up against you.
I swallow them one at a time.
Just practicing in case we get sextuplets to lineup.
They looked so different on Twitter.
Sorry, This job requires you to fit a certain mold.
Lol I'm shaped like a fuckin sausage
Just screw off!
I thought it was an open and shut case
Have you read them their rights?
The big one gave us the co-conspirators, but that's all we could get out of her.
I must be pregnant.  All I want to do is nest.
My wife took the kids after the divorce.
I got these voices inside me telling me they all fit together some way. And one of the voices wants to know if the one third from the right is busy next Friday night.
The long and the short of it is don't be fooled by the dolled-up appearance.
In a strange way she sort of looked like me, maybe smaller
So you're applying for Chain Migration
Nope. No evidence of collusion whatsoever ;).
I figure one of them has to be responsible for election interference.
Yes, these are all women I've loved from a very young age.
Don't know about their ability to commit any of the number of crimes that require limbs, but by golly that was the finest staring contest I've ever been privy too.
Try to be a bigger person.
I can’t see any resemblance. They’re not mine!
Daaarn! I knew we had us a smart president.. but now I understand why he made Mexico pay for that wall between us and them Eastern Europeans!
Five kids in five years & I still don't fit in
Bring in some termites, Natasha. That’ll make them talk.”
Commitment issues, huh? And you’re  sure you’re not the nesting type?
Yeah, I was in on the conspiracy, but I was pretty low on the totem pole.
Let's bring them in and see if they open up.
Now you are saying, somthing 'doesn't' stack up?
Now that I’ve closed the blinds, this shot is sure to go viral
Brighton Beach, maybe once or twice.
At a distance they all look the same to me
They  all  look alike because I used my grandmother as the model.
Everyone says they take after me.
When we separate them from their parents, we keep finding more.
Yes, she had better than average success with this new Russian diet.
Oh come on sarge,
All I know is, my wife and five children have been accused of assault and battery.
The one on the left is a bit full of herself.
Matryoshka #1 steps forward -oh wait.
I feel like you are hiding the real you.
I am not apart of the Russia Investigation.
I say it's an inside job.
Do you see the family resemblance?
You're right. I've taken my addiction too far Captain.
I don’t appreciate your nesting bitch face Joan.
I keep thinking that could've been one of my kids up there.
You said you were going to use random donors
So I'm just another Russian doll?
I told you the suspect was an empty nester.
I don't know, comrade. I'm sorry. She was sitting down.
Somehow I feel like the odds are stacked against me.
I'm tellin' you, I cracked this case wide open.
C-section, yes an excellent deduction but what has that to do with this case?
Don't bother. It looks like an inside job.
look, I don't like it either but we have to shoot one of these dolls to make our quota
Well, we know it was an inside job.
All we need now is a witness.
It's called racial profiling, we've been doing it for years
Now don't be russian into persecuting anyone Larry.
If the witness fingers Number Six, it could crack this Russia thing wide open. Again.
I'm convinced it was an inside job.
Apparently this was not an inside job.
I just don't get it.
You ask about my wife's inner child?  May I ask which one?
'You wouldn't notice if i could wear a babushka too.'
Saying the perp  was a doll who contained multitudes doesn't cut it.
Mary has been hiding in doll number four all day to teach us a lesson about rigged lineups.  But no one has noticed.
I've had a bad case of the babushkas lately.
I found these usual cast of characters all together, but really hiding ALL together.
It’s going to take time to get to the core of this.
All of a sudden it's politically incorrect to ask one of them to step forward.
How about it? Wanna nest?
Honestly Sheriff, it’s not me, it’s the little boy inside me.
How come they all look like you?
Thanks for coming. I needed a witness and she had to be female. I swear the big one just said “I want you inside me.”
Sorry, I meant to use your picture
we're still looking for the father.
Just can't trust those empty nesters.
She can stack more than five at a time, she is not to be trusted.
I made a Browns “won one ring”, but I made these where’s our win dolls for the Jets
Apparently, you get the complete set when you place the mail-order.
Good luck getting her to talk.  There are five more just like her that won’t open up
They said downsizing wasn’t going to reach this department.
I was thrown out of meditation class as I kept finding more of myselves.
I know there's a resemblance, but I'm American Indian on my father's side.
Yes, interesting case: puts a whole new meaning on the term “mass murderer”.
I was told Russian dolls - no mention of attractive women.
Yeah okay, you got me. I was the one who shit them self at Denny’s and then blamed it on the dolls
It was an inside job.  We just don't know how deep it goes.
Nyet, none of these suspects match the description.
Capitalism Redux: 
In a Busted Taxi-Medallion World,
A Matroshka Marketer Courts Love
Sure, they don't look like murderers, but there's no telling what's really inside them.
I got them to spill their guts.
So, what’s involved in down sizing me?
And for the record, it's Detective Magnitsky.
They were on sale — fourty-percent  cheaper than plain Venetian.
Yup, copycat killers
I just think that look of guilt should be obvious to anyone!
What do you mean with "racial profiling"?
I'm pretty sure transitioning isn't a crime anymore.
My gut tells me that there's more to this one than meets the eye.
You look like a 7 to me.
Try and find my inner feelings.
It's the lies within lies that gets to me.
It's not part of the Russia thing, they're just matching sugar bowls.
Empty Nesters are hard to ID . They keep hiding.
I asked the mother to come in after a domestic, then they all appeared.
My boss told me to get my wife in order.
Sue, I am sorry for referring the new temp isn't 'doll' material.
I told Donald that he could use only two matryoshka dolls for the Golden Shower.
It's important that we keep things in perspective.
This time, our informer on the inside wont be able to help us much.
Pull yourself together! You have a job to do.
We searched but didn’t find the goods.
Going to get expensive - the oldest wants to wear Dior.
I’ve been an inside man my whole life, chief.
Yep, definitely No 4.  You can bet she lost those dots at the scene.
My daughters all have great nesting instincts.
I know she was short, so let's go with the one on the right
She's on the right - this was an inside job.
Thank you for releasing my inner female!
So which one is the head matron?
What are the odds...six perfect DNA matches!
"I think I cracked this case wide open."
I'm Question
How do you expect me to identify the perp when they all look alike?
How many more dolls do we have the line up?
I'm pretty sure one of them are guilty of the armed robbery.
I swear Putin had nothing to do with this!
I hate to be pessimistic but I don't think we will get to the bottom of this.
Sometimes I feel so small inside.
WE HAVEN'T SOLD ANY IN FIVE YEARS!  DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCT LINE?
Ixnax on the umptray.
They closed or school and took our equipment, but we still have our Matryoshkas.
Between those seven dwarfs and these six, our gang unit is doing a great job.
It's a collecting hobby. They just remind me of someone!
What do you mean that this is not the kind of Russia investigation you had in mind?.
Yes, if course I have a bit of abdominal discomfort!
Let's put the suspect in the middle.
The good news is he I.D.'ed the tiny one. The bad news is you are filling out the harboring a fugitive forms.
They all turn themselves in individually
You really don't think that these could change the outcome of the next federal election?
Isn't this what you meant by fillers?
They’re accused of insider trading.
See if you can get them to turn to the right.
Not sure if this is relevant, but I do have an astigmatism.
I'm thinking it's #4 because she's lost some of the rosiness in her cheeks but send in the witnesses.
We're just beginning to peel back the onion in this case."
Yes, I brought in a few of my family members for the lineup. How did you know?
after so many years in this job, all the perps look the same to me..
They're from the From Russia with Love collection.  The boss says his new Russian trade agreement is going to be HUGE.
I need help. I've run out of creative ideas.
What say we go and do some nesting of our own?
That's Russian doll, not Russian troll
When I get one to crack….. out pops another!
Forget it Casandra, I won't let you inside me again.
It's made me start to wonder. Just what's inside of me?
I know she said 5’7 but are people ever really right when they guess someone’s height?
I've decided uncover the Russian collusion by myself.
How can I be the bad cop, Look at those faces.
Well, it said “Drink Me” so I did. 
Could you help me find the White Rabbit?
You know, from the looks of it, seems like it might be an inside job.
Our victim says the little one started it all and the rest piled on."
Come on, be patient Sarge. My guess is the Russian case will be stacking up for us any time now.
Come on , let your inner voice out
When your mom comes to visit you when you're stoned.
I swear I got them, boss. They’re the ones who did it!
Would there be any other Russian doll with a secret?
Cutting costs is Job 1.
I'm telling you, we still have plausible deniability on the charge of sex in the workplace!
Arm The Kewpies? Ridiculous! You're NRA, right?
Comrade, am filing gender discrimination suit.
These Russian attacks on our democracy keep scaling up.
This is up there with the sextuplets case.
A voice deep down inside me says the little one is the brains of the family.
The witness said the female perp had a sexy build.
I’m sorry boss, but they were all impersonating a police officer!
They're all in Dutch the law - but some more so than others.
Could we be using too MUCH perspective on Russian concealment of agents?
Screw it, they’re Russians.  Let’s just have them all prosecuted.
And that's where the dog was buried.
Call Mueller in; one of the six was at the Trump Tower meeting!
Very well then I contradict myself; (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
Canoodling? Sure. Colluding? Never!
Are you saying that the "Me Too" movement is a conundrum?
You've been charged with kidnapping.
Shall we talk about gravitational attraction before we are completely underwater?
Comrade, I'm too big to fit in with the group..
I totally get why I'm fired but you gotta admit it's pretty amazing how they all fit inside of me.
Classic case of shrunken identity.
You and your damn "peel away the onion" are going to drive us out of business!
It's the next step beyond in-vitro
I’ve always felt there was more to me than people gave me credit for.
I used to be an accountant. I fell into modeling by accident.
Well I didn't know us Russians had to reveal all layers of the story!"
There's just no market for the male version.
You won't be sorry if you hire me, I have a feeling, I'll fit in with everyone.
Would you like a shoe shine ?
I had to get the wife and kids to fill in.
I'm a twin.  He's a little smaller than me.
‘The killer is even smaller than number six.’ I heard it same as you. But how can we find her, captain? Where would we even begin to look?
They always look the same to me, but the one babe #4 isn't blushing and I'd know her anywhere.
No Russian to judgment.
I think this department could do a hellava lot better when the witness describes "a bushy-haired stranger".
I know these dolls look innocent, but the law is stacked against them.
NYET!
Товарищ, пожалуйста, один колдун одновременно!
My theory - the short one did it.
They're all covering for the little one on the right.
Hajib?   Babuska?
OK. If it is really important for the good of the State, I'll start making Putins
This Russia probe seems to be getting smaller the more we dig into it.
All but one of them seem to fit in.
Could you have your wife put on rouge?
....Yeah. So strangely enough, that was my experience with 90 Day Fiance. Unwittingly, I became part of an illegal immigrant operation.
I'm the only one.
My daughter made me do it.
Where's my damn tote bag?
In no particular order: Melania, Ivanka, Kellyanne, Sarah, Omarossa, and one whose name I can't recall.
What do you expect? The suspect is a babushka.
Do you want to see the boy clones, too?
How did you know my daughters left for college?
Be a doll and go get me a cup of coffee.
Well, I can't figure it out but I have a sudden urge to call my Mother.
You are my little Russian doll!
Wait, you wanted the Fabergé Egg Gang?
No one is talking, but we think Russia is behind it.
I grilled them all from large to small and they gave exactly the same story.
Me next.
I feel like their hiding something.
Did you notice that the smallest one has orange hair?
Ok, why do YOU think I wanted a Russian doll wife?
I don’t think that’s what they meant by asking us to demonstrate tolerating diversity in the workplace.
the one on the end looks familiar!
So I'm a dick, but inside I feel there's another me itching to get out.
Calls? I thought you said, ‘investigate the Russian dolls’.
The poison is hidden in #5 so to fool them you see...
My wife packed my suitcase - I didn't know they were in there.
Haven't seen him.
She said it was immaculate conception---that's why they all look like her!
Remember, the whole family has to fit inside --- you!
As a matter of fact, yes, I do think the case is stacked against my client.
But they ALL look like Maria Butina!
There are a lot of Russian operatives who look like me, but I assure you you've got the wrong guy...
And they say that behind every homunculus there’s a good woman in a good woman in a good woman in a good woman....
What's inside a woman unraveled before today Denise.
You really can’t pick which doll it was out of the line-up?
Nyet, was his final answer ... but remember he's Russian.
No Claire, I am not biased on this case!
I never knew my parents.  I'm an orphan.  Why do you ask?
You didn't say what KIND of doll...
It's an in-service training on accessing your inner child.
Your kids? All 21 years old. Are you sure you had nothing to do with Russian voting interference?
Dolls"? All I see are unique, intelligent, individual women
No distinguishing features--this is a tough one.
The longer we investigate, more and more Russians become suspects.
Well, they're definitely guilty of going into Planned Parenthood.
We will NEVER mold or try to influence you.....
A very crafty inside job by the Russians.
She couldn't hide her inner self, is that my fault?
...is it twelve o'clock yet?  I'm in the mood for some kiev"
How big is yours?
I know that it looks bad, but there was NO COLLUSION!
I believe in you. Practice makes perfect.
The freckled one, what's she hiding?
I started collecting Russian dolls since I was five years old.
So, how does this job stack up to your last job
Are we too tough on borders?
They hadn't had birth control by then.
It was women of varied heights . . . . Probably five could fit inside me
They're all guilty of insider trading except for the first.
Honey, we really can’t protect our girls forever.
You told me to round up the usual suspects.
I swear you said "dolls", not "trolls".
What else could I do?  One of them is guilty of collusion.
I'm not even sure that collusion is a crime.
Can we reconsider the King's horses? I still don't think this was an inside job. . .
Apparently, she said that she said that she said that she said that...
It's my wife and daughters, they stole my nest.
If I hear one more "empty nesters" joke .......
I thought you wanted a lineup of the Russians.
I wouldn't mind coming inside you,my little Matryoshka.
Sure, I could have made them hollow...but why
I know I'm only allowed one child. But that means one child per wife, doesn't it?
They are all Russians, aren't they?
Is this where I register for colluding with Donald Trump?
They said they we're Russian. The cops said they had all night.
There's something eerie going on here... It doesn't fit.
Bring in the victim.
From an external perspective, a lot of people had left and the atmosphere change. Those who remained seemed to embody the true spirit of Burning Man. From an internal perspective, I had stopped trying to control or judge my experience with my head, a
Matryoshka? I hardly know 'a.
Okay, now let's see what you've got in you!
At first I thought it was one perp, but six of them were hiding. It's definitely a gang.
Matryoshka's told me they wanted to be ninjas
I can't tell unless you make them wobble.
Could they face right?
The lowdown is that one of the 'Dolls' led the election hack.
I feel something is missing inside me.
Excuse me just curious why the dolls.
I have this gnawing sense that my inner child is trying to get my attention.
It never seems to end with this kid.......
Why do all the dolls look like your sister?
The most important thing is pronouncing their names right.
They said their commune had some bad egg salad
Well, all signs point to the Russian"
the maht-er of all chain migration
We got a break and were able to identify which of the nesting dolls the killer midget hid in.
I just got off the phone with the Russian consulate. They claim she has diplomatic immunity.
Honestly, I don't see any distinguishing features among them.
The witness says she sometimes struggles with her depth perception.
I know, I know, but only Mueller's people were in the squad room.
Why hello, Dolly!
All we know so far is that 
it's an inside inside inside inside inside job.
C'Mon Sis. You know nepotism is frowned upon around her.
I took care of Eeeney, Meeeny. Miney, but Mo told me to bug off her little sisters,

I need a vacation
This cannibalism case is proving harder to crack than I expected.
Security here does not drive me crazy and is not as boring as you would think. Once a week I get to take inventory and even dust them off. Once, the little one tried to escape.
Next time, do you think I could fit some cigarettes and Brandy too?
Couldn’t get an ID, the victim said the woman was more put together.

Nesters shmesters.....they give me the shpilkes!!
Creation myth revisited.
They should mule on how much they nested!
GET ELIZABETH AND PHILLIP
THEY'LL KNOW
Only today do I truly understand this hollow feeling I’ve had all my life.
Let ‘em all go. The perp had a meaner resting bitch face, just like my mother.
Once they open up, I have a feeling there's a lot more inside
Family resemblance is not a thing here!
Welcome to the line down.
It's my nesting troll farm.
Wouldn’t we have more room if we stacked each one inside the next biggest?
We were supposed to investigate Russian trolls, not Russian dolls.
Oddest lineup I've ever run, and they've wrecked havoc with all my nesting instincts.
When you said the suspect was wearing layers, this is where my mind went.
Well you kinda’ look like Raggedy Ann but I’m not blaming you for designer ripped jeans.
I'm afraid it may have been an inside job....
“I really thought these dolls would be more important than those silly Faberge´ eggs."
Our middle daughter is missing!
This case is just like the Mueller Russia Probe - a crime inside a crime inside a crime.
Not sure I can get to the bottom of this on my own.
Perhaps we should switch to color?
If we get a clear ID, the Russian mob is finished.
I think it’s the little one, she’s always hiding inside the rest
We are investigating it as an inside job.
The set was made in 1984 in conjunction with some book.

Yes, I know. there were supposed to be seven. But these Russkies are tricky.
My hunch tells me it's the little Odessa"
Sorry, Sweet Cheeks, but I suspect the one without dimples.
One of them is surely guilty, I know their kind.....
Personally, I think this case is stacking up just fine.
These are the official Stormy Nesting dolls

Yes, Hilda will be four next month.
The longer you sit, the rounder you feel
That Russian Dating Site said they had the perfect women for me.
Your Russia investigation is a witch hunt.
I refused to shave my mustache.....
I thought you said to round up the usual Russian Suspects?
See if you can pick out the one in which I fit best.
I need a raise. I’m a single father of 5 in 1.
Nesting Doll? I thought you said, "Resting, Paul?"
My personal preference is for mermaids.
It wasn't hard to find fillers.
The one one right was the inside man.
.....so then he asked, "Can you make one just a little smaller?"
Looking at them it makes me feel like there are other mes inside this me. Lots of them.
I think one of them is hiding the littlest baby doll.
They swear they’re not related!
Stop rushin’, doll.”
Amazing. They all fit the suspect's proportions exactly.
That is all I could find for your line-up.
This one goes all the way to the top.
Compared to what?
it was suspect number five. she's the one that killed my wife on that rainy night, twenty years ago. my decades-long nightmare has finally ended, and i will not rest until i see this bastard fry.
You wanted good? This is a great-great-great-great lineup.
I accidently bumped into the largest one.  She rocked back and forth and suddenly split open.
I tell you it was the little one - an inside job.
Sargent, any idea yet which one is the Russian Spy?
This job makes me feel so compartmentalized.
Does this tie make my neck look bigger?
Get off that chair and back with the rest of the dolls; your lack-of-neck was a dead giveaway

Who said anything about collusion?
Not to worry.  We’re all inside you.
This suspects of this case seems never ending.
This is not a hoax.
I told you before, my family doesn't want to do these practice line-ups anymore!
To be honest, I think there's no more to you than meets the eye.
Can you ask them to turn around?
Don't be so quick to judge - there's more to me than meets the eye.
looks like their alibi's all fit together .
I find you Russians to be completely full of yourselves.
These people look as though they would fit inside one another, but they don't for they are not hollow.
I understand your counterparts are spread on level A
What’s the rush in cracking This?
As I recall, the one on the end seems a little too short.
One of them is hiding something.  Besides they are Russians
Czechoslovakia...smuggled...a wooden container...on top of one another...Oh, the horror!
The DNA analysis revealed that I'm the father.
She fits all the descriptions.
In Russia, usual suspects round up you!
I suspect Russian collusion on this one.
There's a cuddly for every age group.
I'm pretty sure it was the one in the middle.
So, contra-inception requires a dreamer and a subject at each level?
—“Why don’t they smile like us?”
—“Maybe they were painted without smiles”
I’m pretty sure I’m related to all of them.
The victim described the attacker as "a little inside her own head".
There's forty more in the smallest one if you need them.
They all look the same to me...

The inner me is a lot like the outer me, only smaller
I seriously doubt there has been any Russian meddling!
My Natasha left nest a year ago. I cannot pick her out. All Russians look the same to me.
I was a perfect fit for the job.
We know you did it; We want to know why you kept them all on the same display shelf."
Looks like the Matryoshka Gang again officer. Always the same
M.O.: the mother goes into the vault alone and she and five sisters come out with the cash.
Don't make elephant out of fly. When they hand to children at White House during Christmas visit, huge will be tremendous.
No Maam, It's not a suspect line-up.
It's just my family bringing me lunch!
I thought you'd be impressed.
Wait until you see what's inside of me!
But.. I am positive one of them did it!
What?! They absolutely matched your description: different sizes, they all look the same and they're all Russians.
...But detective you can see I don’t fit into this case.
Never heard of multiple peronalities?
I have a keen insight for this case.

Jim, where's the rest of the paperwork?
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
This is a tough one. Not only do they look innocent, they’re all just so rolly-polly and cute...
Listen up egghead, your about to be like those dolls. Retired.
Remember, don't be Russian through this case.
With a face like that you're perfect for radio.
These line-ups are getting tougher and tougher.
Come on,it's taken me years to get into this shape.  Just let me try.
Why do I think the jury is rigged?
Fake news!
I'm trying keep it together, but this case keeps pulling me apart...
Our eye witness says the perp was taller.
Don't ask me. She's different, that's all.
Officer Barnes, we have reason to believe that you are involved in this case. Open wide!
I hope this sting works to nail the doll snatchers!
Please describe your nesting skills...
I just don't see any room for advancement.
Hiya doll face!
They all claim they had nothing to do with the election.
You have no idea what's going on inside of me.

Well this is the first I’m hearing that the sketch artist is Russian.
Our case is wobbling, but I promise it won't fall down.

I told you to stop working so much overtime
Two are lesbians, four are straight.
That Putin: he promised me teens for my youth group and instead he sent me these empty nesters.
These gals ain't no pushovers.

The one with the Hermes babushka
Maybe you should take some time off Jim?
I said “line up”, not “doll up”
I ran out of wood.
i’m trying to be a good partner here... but frankly, you’re full of yourself.
I'm just sure of one thing. Of these six suspects there is only one that would not be able to eat anyone. But which?
You know Nadia, that twenty years in the Nesting department has changed me, and , for some reason, I feel like I could fit easily into either the Nutcracker or Icon department.
No, Ma'am, those dolls are hiding nothing, nothing at all...
Ever feel like it's catching up to you?
Why are you always rushing me?
They all look capable of violent activity to me...

I can't contain myself, Susan, I need to tell you how much I love you.
O.k, so I'm an arms dealer, I've never killed anyone.
Let’s face it, eventually the ‘nesting instinct’ takes over.
Actually, the age progressions look pretty much the same.

Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Yup, these are totally the usual suspects.

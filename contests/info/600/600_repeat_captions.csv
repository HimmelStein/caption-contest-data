Oops ... looks like we beamed-up Scotty.
Who’s turn is it to take him for a space walk?
Down, boy.
I thought we were beaming up a Scottie.
So, there is intelligent life on earth afterall!

Hi, my name is Scotty...
Finally, someone who speaks our language!
It says it wants to be our best friend.
Take us to your Cesar.

A close encounter of the furred kind.
Speak!...Speak!
Let's name him Rover.
Careful! He charms and enslaves two-legged beings.
"i thought we ordered a pizza".
Who's a good alien?
Siriusly?
Who rescued who?
In outer space, nobody knows you're a dog.
Don’t take us to your leader.
Beam me up, Scottie Dog.
Dog. God spelled backwards.
Who's a good boy?
Aw, can we keep him?
You're WHOSE best friend?
Noooo...I said beam me up a Scottie.
It's your turn to walk him.
It's your turn to take him outside.
I sure hope he's housebroken!
Supposedly he's the best friend.
I said "beam me up Scotty" not "beam me up Spotty"!
Take us to your master.
Good...boy...?
. . . to boldly go where no dog has gone before!
Take me to your gentle leader.
It's not Pluto.
Tell us about your best friend
Dog is my co-pilot.
It's your turn to take him for a walk.
Beam him up, Spotty.
Take me to your pack leader!

He's trying to sniff Uranus.
Can we keep him daddy?
Who's going to walk him?

He followed us home.
"He followed me home. Can we keep him?

Take us to your lead dog.
They seem friendly.
Who’s Scotty?
Can I keep him?
Who is your best friend?
He said, "Beam me up a Scottie," right?
I said, "Beam me up a Scotty", not a Lab.
But is he OUR best friend?
In space, no one can hear you bark.
Take me to your leader of the pack.
Beam me up, Scottie!

Let's name him Scotty.
It followed me home. Can I keep him?
Are you Sirius?
Houston, we have a problem.
He looks friendly.
I said “Beam me up Scotty!” not “Beam me up a Scottie!”
He’s a rescue.
He looks, like, really smart!
They are more evolved then we imagined.
I said bring me their GOD not their DOG.
Take us to your Alpha dog.
I guess there is intelligent life on Earth.
No, I said "Beam me up a Scotty".
It doesn't look like a Scottie!
I said, 'Beam me up a Scottie!'
There IS intelligent life on earth!
Do you think he needs to go out?
Can you be our best friend, too?
Dogonit!

I said Scotty, not Spotty!
Sit!
I think it needs to go out.
Take us to your leader!
Do you think Mom will let us keep him?
I think he likes me!
Greetings bitch.
I think she wants to go for a spacewalk.
You can't be Sirius.
The dyslexic Martians' search for God was doomed from the beginning.
There really is a Dog!
Lead me to your taker

'Ah yes, it is just how we pictured it. A human being."
Its an Earthling called "K-9" but is very fond of Uranus.
All I said was beam me up Spottie!

Fetch your leader
So this is Scotty
I hope he's UFO broken.
Who wants to go for a spacewalk?
Aw, can keep this earthling?

My left or your left?
I always knew we'd wind up together.
Oh dear, that's my wife!  Act casual.
If this shows up in National Geographic, we'll never hear the end of it.
Please wag your tail, so I know which one is me.
You’re sure you saw this in the Kama Sutra?
This is why I’m not a hugger, Gerald.
Well, we're screwed.
You got it backwards.  It's righty tighty, lefty loosey.
I'm looking for love, not entanglement"
The lions are just laughing. That's good, right?
counter clockwise on three.
You and your "lets try new positions".
Well...so much for necking.
5 o’clock...time to unwind!
Okay, the next time a bee flies around us I say we leave it alone...
Now remember: righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
Whatever you do, don't sneeze!!!
Let's play 'Twister', he says. It'll be fun, he says. What could possibly go wrong, he says. Idiot.
Next time, let's skip the foreplay.
Oh, no; was that the boarding announcement for the Ark?
I don't think that this is what they meant by 'tying the knot'
It looked a lot simpler when the swans did it.
I just want to go home and unwind.
That’s not my fat ass, that’s your fat ass!
Maybe we're not ready to tie the knot.
Good! Now we can go to the Halloween party as DNA.
I'm trying to see it from your point of view.
Next, if I remember correctly, we do the hokey-pokey then turn ourselves around.
They say it takes two to tangle.
It was more an entanglement than a serious affair.
See, hiccups gone!
It looked so easy on YouTube.
How did we wind up together?
Let’s stay in and unwind tonight...
Your right or my right?
I never thought this is how I would wind up.
If this doesn't get us into National Geographic, I give up.
Wrap your head around that" is just an expression
Sorry...what was our safe word?
Take the picture already!
We should have stayed with missionary.
They say to go to the ER after 4 hours.
Now slide your head through there and we’ve got a classic half-Windsor.
Just necking won't get us into trouble you said!
If we die like this, we could be a really confusing fossil.
Stop calling this a 'simple twist of fate'.
Conscious uncoupling is our only hope.
I can’t seem to wrap my head around you wrapping your head around my head.
Until now I didn’t know lions could laugh.
I don't usually do this on a first date.
I hate yoga
Can we please just do a pinky swear next time, like everyone else?
This is the last time we try couples yoga.
Oh my, I've never gone this far on a first date!
Wait...my left or your left?
Geoffrey’s first kiss did not go as planned.
I don't understand why necking is a thing?
Ugh. I warned you that sex therapist was a snake.
It looked a lot more fun in the Kama Sutra.
My clockwise or your clockwise?
My mother always said ‘Once you start necking there’s no telling where it might end.’
My right, not your right.
Just take the photo, Dwayne!  I’m starting to regret this!
A simple kiss on the cheek would have been fine.
"Herbert, have we gotten too wrapped up in each other?"
Do you remember how we wound up together?
Well, once we had a relationship.  Now it's just an entanglement.
Um, this may not be the best time to bring it up but .... LION!!!!!
Just don't cough.
I always love necking with you.
I think the Kama Sutra is not for us
I just never dreamed we'd wind up together.
...120, 121, 122! Now count mine.
How did we wind up like this?
I think we must be doing it wrong.
Good thing it's not a threesome.
No - my left not your left.
Are you seeing someone behind my back?
Let's just hope National Geographic isn't around.
Don't give me that 'A-Wimoweh' crap. If the lion doesn't sleep tonight, we're screwed.
And how, exactly, do you define 'anticlockwise'?
I still don’t see it.
I don’t know why humans think ‘necking’ is so great...
You'd better figure this out before my dad gets back.....
Sorry—it’s my first time, too.
I'll watch my back, and you watch yours.
Let's just stay home tonight and unwind.
One more try: I'll move anti-clockwise, you just STAY THE HELL STILL.
I still can’t see you!
You're from Great Neck? I'm from Great Neck!
I guess now is a good time to tell you... I need some space.
Trust me, all the European giraffes do it this way.
Sorry, I guess that's my butt that looks fat.
I think I’m going to sneeze.
We're screwed, Harold.
Lions! Run!
Well, now you’ve done it — Harold will be home any moment.
I always hoped we'd wind up together.
You stand still and I'll walk around you.
I think we need to spend a little time apart.
You're not really a chiropractor, are you?
I hate to tell you this, but I have to cough.
I think four is the Serengeti record.
I said COUNTER clockwise.
We should go somewhere and unwind.
Should we exchange insurance information?
I told you the Camel Sutra wouldn't work for us!
And that's how I met your mother, kids.
This is exactly why I told you I wanted to avoid entanglements.
If that lion circles us one more time, we’re done for.
It confuses the lions.
Let's just try missionary.
Wanna have a drink to unwind?
Trust me, if we unwind really, really fast—we'll fly.
Well, it takes two to tangle.
Yes I love you... in a twisted sort of way...
Just act casual.
We're south of the equator,fool, go counterclockwise.
That's the last time I'll watch a tennis match with you.
I meant "your" left
I overheard the lions calling us a ‘two for one special’.
Everyone always said we would wind up together.
Okay, let's call it a tie.
Let's just have a drink and unwind.
This way, we always have each other's backs.
I think we should consciously uncouple
The hyenas are laughing.
No, your left...my right!
We must have really tied one on last night.
I think we need a safe word"
OK, now counterclockwise.
Did you even read the instructions?
You lost me at put your right foot in, then put your right foot out
I stick my neck out for you and all you do it twist what I say!
No, below the equator we go counter clockwise."
OK, now do you understand the DNA double helix?
I have no idea why your therapist thinks we're codependent.
Oh, what a tangled web we weaved
Who would have thought we would wind up together?
Let’s call it a tie.
I think we should seperate,Geoffrey.
Look, if you don't want to kiss me you should just say so.
Sometimes I feel we're too wrapped up in each other.
If its all the same to you, next time we should just fist bump.
If you say, 'No, over there!' one more time I swear I'm going to figure out how to kick you.
Did they take the picture yet?
Neckrophilia in the wild
I think I prefer missionary.
We screwed up.
Stop swallowing - you're choking me.
I think it's time we split up.
Mom, I'm only going to be away a couple days!
Nope, it still itches.
So, now that we've twisted the night away, what do you suggest we do now?
I'm not sure I like this new twist in our relationship.
I've heard of necking, but this is just silly.
Look..I don't want to go round and round on this.
Why won't you ever look at me when I am talking to you!
You're right. Let's not feed each other cake at the wedding.
I think it’s over and under and THEN around.
Let's play twister, they said. It'll be fun, they said...
You were the one who wanted to do the hokey pokey and 
 turn yourself around.'
....and that’s what it’s all about!
I hope second base is easier.
You do have an irregular spot on the back of your neck.
Oh no!  The kids are home early!
Since I have you here, do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
Couldn’t we just neck without going all the way?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Maybe next time we skip the foreplay?
Good question. How do you usually unwind?
You'll do anything to avoid kissing me.
One more time, righty tighty, lefty loosey.
This is all very nice, Arthur, but my folks are going to want to see a ring.
I forget our safe word.
Well this is a plot twist.
Do you think we have a twisted relationship?
You always twist things around when we argue.
I take it you missed me?
You have a twisted sense of humor and are a real pain in the neck.
Making a promise sure would be easier if we had pinkies!
Let’s twist again like we did last summer.
Uh oh, lion...
This is exactly why we need a safe word.
You'd think we'd learn.
I'm uncomfortable with this arrangement.
Wait. Am I looking at your ass or mine?
I don't mean to hurt you but I think I need a bit more freedom in our relationship.
Next dance, let me lead.
Don’t take it the wrong way, I just feel like I need some space.
Now that I know that you're flexible,  I know something else we might try.
No wonder we’re almost extinct.
It's not you, it's me.
So then I asked, what's a double helix?
Henry, will you stop screwing around?
Geoffrey it was just a spider. Get off of me.
That’s it. No more texting while foraging.
We may be too wrapped up in each other.
Don't sneeze.
I was just following Google maps.
Shall we make it official and tie the knot?
We have to reevaluate our secret handshake.
This can’t be right.
Okay, let's stop watching the vultures.
I just can’t face you when we get this way.
I don't care--tell a joke, whatever, just keep the lion laughing while I figure this out.
Boris Johnson said this would be easy.
When the safari comes by, we're gonna rule Instagram.
You just had to drag me into your twisted world.
I had never seen a drone either
I'm not the only one that thinks our relationship is twisted.
I realize this may not be the best time, but Chad, I want a divorce.
I knew it was a mistake to try couples yoga.
OK! I'll say it.
We're neck-and-neck!
Remember now- Righty tighty, Lefty loosy,
Where are you?
Let's hope one of those photo safaris doesn't drive by.
That's the last time we watch a drone together!
I think we've just invented the icon for Veterinarians.
Let me guess, this is the first time you’ve necked.
Could be worse. It could’ve been drawn by Escher
I can't believe I let you drag me into this couple's yoga thing.
My bad. I forgot our safe word.
Yep, we're both completely covered in them...
This why I hate foreplay.
I'm so glad I wound up with you.
I think it’s time for a conscious uncoupling.
My parents warned me about necking.
My therapist says I have boundary issues.
My mother warned me about too much necking
OK, first base.  
Now what?
I think we should spend some time apart.
Can we skip the team-building exercises next time?
This isn't quite what I imagined when you asked if I wanted to screw.
If you had only asked for directions....
Let's check the book again, something seems to be wrong.
Hurry up! Take the picture!
No, no,no.  Counterclockwise! Counterclockwise!
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Act natural, maybe no one will notice.
I think we just took a turn for the worse.
I can't wait to see you again either.
You say Kama Sutra. I say Chiropractor.
I think we're screwed no matter how we look at it.
I'm not convinced that "Giraffe Kama Sutra" was actually written by a giraffe.
Yeah, it looked exotic, but they were snakes!
We just don't to seem to see eye to eye anymore.
I have to pee.
I have your back.
This is why I hate hugs.
Shoot, I forgot the selfie stick!
Think this will confuse the Trump boys enough that they won't shoot us?
Sorry, it's my first time.
This is our last tango
Now it says right ear on brown circle. Well that doesn't help!
That’s not exactly what I had in mind when I suggested a necktie
I still don't see what they say is so great about necking.
We really should have paid more attention in SexEd
We have a very twisted relationship.
I think we're doing it wrong?
And you're sure this is necking?
Uh, hi Mom!  We're doing math homework!
Here comes a safari bus - quick, let's go back to doing nothing
Yet another bad idea from your therapist.
Uh-oh.  I think I'm going to sneeze.
Okay, so according to the song, all we have to do now is ‘Shout!’
That new spot on your butt looks fine. How's do my spots look?
Lefty loosey, righty tighty!
I TOLD you I wanted a relationship with no entanglements.
I think I've got it this time: On the count of three, we BOTH go clockwise.
What part of ‘’let’s avoid attracting tourists’” you didn’t understand.
I am trying to see things your way!
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.
Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten us into.
Some day we will be on the Endangered Species List and this will be a big reason why.
It’s called “necking”, although I don’t see the attraction.
You always twist everything I say.
I might have been raised in captivity, but I’m pretty sure this is where babies come from.
I'm confused - which one is me ?
No, I said, "righty tighty, LEFTY LOOSEY!"
Next time we lose the remote, only one of us looks for it .
You're sure that the invitation said "neck ties mandatory"?
There’s a spider on your butt, or is it mine?
So where do YOU go to unwind?
I'm feeling ready to update our relationship status to: "It's complicated."
THE HAZARDS OF NECKING:  A CAUTIONARY TALE
Your mother's coming. Look happy.
No, YOU'RE being clingy!
When you said you were kinky, this isn't what I had in mind.
Maybe watching the race from the middle of the track was not such a good idea.
It’s a tie game - we’re neck and neck
I don't know. I just think at some point something has to go IN somewhere.
If we could untangle your earbuds, we can do this.
Is this your twisted idea of romance?
Now I remember why we mate so infrequently.
Are you sure the book said form a double helix?
Sex? We can't even figure out necking!
...Another fine mess you've gotten us into...
What say we unwind tonight and order takeout?
Am I seeing what you're seeing, or are you seeing what I'm seeing?
I'm still hicupping.  Now what?
Let's go back to missionary.
It was tango lessons not tangle lessons.
All of my friends told me not to get tangled up with you.
Remember when a handshake was enough ?
It wasn't enough to have me wrapped around your finger?
Relationship status: it’s complicated
This relationship has taken a strange twist.
Let's call it a neck tie.
Wouldn't a high five be simpler?
This relationship is strangling me.
We shouldn’t have installed a ceiling fan!
So are we like a thing now?
On the next episode of "Nature"...when Giraffe secret handshakes go horribly wrong.
Wait a sec... Which spot did you want me to look at?
Saying you are a pain in the neck doesn’t BEGIN to describe it.
Next time we see a tourist helicopter circling overhead let’s not stand so close.
We really need to work on keeping our cool when there's a bee around"
Left hoof, green.
If this doesn't get a yoga position named after us, nothing will.
What the hell is 'conscious uncoupling'?
Is this your first time?
But do you think she'll notice the hickey?
For once, try to see things my way.
Don't panic! If I can untangle the Christmas lights, I can figure this out, too.
Is this what monogamy feels like?
Ok, now wiggle your front left hoof.
Because we can.
Couples yoga, you said.  It'll be fun, you said.
I''ll always have your back.
You put your  left foot in: I'll put my left foot out.....
You always were a pain in the neck.
Dammit, Bill, I told you we should’ve asked for directions.
This is nothing...just wait until we get to second base!
Oh, no--my parents are back!
And then you said, "let's dance closer to the ceiling fan!"
Next time a bee comes let's run in opposite directions.
Next time, let's shake hands.
Now that we can watch each other's back, what happens if we need to run?
Look me straight in the eye and say that.
They said we would wind up like this.
We just tied the knot!
Let's just agree to disagree.
Is this foreplay or an extreme sport?
Oh crap, my parents are home.
So what do you do to unwind?
I told you, let ME lead!
I thought I was straight.
Must you twist everything I say?
Let's decide on a safe word before we get to the Gordian Knot position!
I'm looking forward to unwinding. It's been a long day.
No, I don't need to ask for directions.
I've had it up to here with you.
I wish the lion would start circling in the opposite direction.
Now what, Mr. Foreplay?
At this point, I don't think it matters whose neck is longest!
Sometimes I can't tell where I end and you begin.
Trust me, this will get us on the Endangered Species List.
They made it look so easy on Pinterest.
Are you sure "lanyard" is a yoga pose?
Why do you always look the other way when I have something to say?
I’m changing our Facebook status to ‘It’s complicated’.
Let’s just get to the watering hole and ask the elephants.
And that's a wrap.
Rightie tightie, Leftie loosie!
Have you had that spot looked at?
Please do not get the hiccups or you will strangle the both of us.
After all these years of marriage, it's become very hard to determine where you end and I begin.
Is it just me or did you find those directions hard to follow?
If only we'd a moment to unwind
Right foot yellow
Let's go home and unwind.
Wow!  Was it good for you?
I just can’t wrap my head around it.
That made it worse. Try the other way.
It’s only until the Ark leaves.
There's a simpler way to explain DNA
I told you it was a bad idea to go to the tennis match
Uh, do you remember the safe word?
A simple touch of noses would have done it for me.
This always happens when YOU try to lead.
And then we do the hokey-pokey.
Ah, what’s our safe word!?
Sorry...gonna sneeze.
You lead.
I forget, which one am I?
I love your spots -- or are those mine?
This photographer is killing us with these crazy wedding shots.
Why don't we just untwist and shout!
So that’s what the hokey-pokey’s all about?
NO means no.
Thanks for the Heimlich maneuver -- I'm okay now.
Lean in closer, you said. Nibble on my ear, you said...
Next couples session we have to address our co-dependency.
I think we should separate.
I'm really glad you don't like threesomes.
I think I'm okay with being single.
That's not exactly what I meant when I said we should finally tie the knot, Louis.
I want to date other people.
Is this from the Kamasutra or Ruth Westheimer?
Next time, just a fist bump.
Okay, now what?!
I'm going to change my status to "in a relationship."
OK, so tango is harder than it looks.
”Head in, head out. Well, you can forget shake it all about.
I thought you said it would just be a little necking.
It's neck AND neck- not neck IN neck.
Are you sure the lions will think we're a tree?
Why do I get the feeling you've been seeing the boa constrictor again.
Now let's untwist and do the limbo.
Not being straight is harder than than I expected.
It’s like a pinky promise, but more.
This ought to confuse the lions.
Let's Twist again the way we did last summer .
I don’t think that this is what they meant when they said the double helix is the key to evolving.
Do you think we’re having trouble making friends because we’re too wrapped up in ourselves?
Let's just go back to missionary.
What part of counter clockwise aren't you getting?
You have the absolute worst sense of direction!
How did we manage to crash when we're the only two giraffes in sight?
I don't think this is the way we are supposed to procreate.
I don't know. What does have brown spots, 8 legs, and is a real pain in the neck?
Okay, this time you go left, and I'll go right.
Let’s have a glass of wine and see if we can unwind.
I just wanted to hold your hoof.
No, I specifically said counter-clockwise!
Don't close your eyes, the next time you try to kiss me.
How we gonna explain this to your dad?
I get too wound up when we neck
Let's try it again. This time, when I say "go left", it's your left, not my left.
Life is complex but love is twisted.
Can we please ask someone for directions?
I'm just saying, Bernard: you're a little clingy.
I don't know where you end and I begin anymore.
Are you sure this is how they do it on the Discovery Channel?
I think the dress code said neck ties are optional.
For the last time...turn towards MY left.
Ta Da!
I’ve heard of necking, but this is ridiculous...
When I said turn to the right, I meant MY right, not YOURS.
You really are a pain in the neck!
If only Bertha was here... we could make a braid.
When I said I like kinky love, this isn't what I had in mind.
If you turn on me one more time, we’re done.
But enough about me, how do you like to unwind?
I swear!  I read the directions three times.
This is not what I meant by a necktie!
Mom warned me about what necking would lead to.
Next time let's just high-five.
It was cute for a while.  Now it just seems annoying and French.
I’m starting to think that Lion wasn’t really a Zumba instructor..
It's not you--I just need a little space right now...
Are you sure this is what humans mean by necking?
Don’t forget. Nothing below the neck before we get married.
Tantric yoga," you said.
"It'll be fun," you said
The hyenas will never let us hear the end of it.
I keep telling you, lefty-loosey!
It's called the double helix pose.  We learned it in yoga class.
Let's just call it a tie!
Wait, am I you or me?
You go low.  I’ll go high.
Now lift your butt for the pretzel pose.
Let's start over.  I'm looking at my own butt.
I said French kiss not French braid
Don't worry, honey, they accept all sorts on the ark.
No, the rule is righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
Necking sucks, let's french kiss.
This was a terrible time to tell me you voted for Trump.
Thank you for being flexible.
I think we're screwed!
Next time we see a helicopter, let's not try to count the blades.
Nope, still not in the mood...
I thought you said you'd watch MY back!
I'm not really a hugger.
Perhaps we should sit farther apart when listening to the next Democratic debate.
Next time just nibble on my ear
Honestly, I don’t remember a thing about last night.
Well, I looked back to see if you looked back
I thought necking was reserved for the second date.
I don't know who you are anymore.
OMG, my neck feels better already!
Giraffe gaffe.
Oh just great  .
In the New Yorker nonetheless .
This relationship is getting to be a real pain in the neck.
Oh Christ, I don't know Myrna.  It looks like fun when the swans do it!
I didn't mean "tie the knot" literally.
No! Righty tighty lefty loosey!
Whatever you do, please don't cough.
I didn't think necking would be so complicated.
So that's a tornado .
I know we have limited Halloween costume options but the 'Double Helix' is just plain dumb.
Wow, we can give a whole new meaning to necking.
I'm telling you, it's "righty tighty, lefty loosey!"
I’m beginning to find this relationship suffocating.
Can you see the mole now?
I don’t need another possessive relationship, Dennis.
I think this team work thing has gone too far
Mom!  We did it again!
Okay, so we've done the Double Helix.  What's next?
Necking is one thing, but I never agreed  to going all the way!
I’m getting a little uncomfortable with this level of commitment.
Let's try the Macarena instead.
It’s over, Louise. I know you’ve been stepping out with the python
This time I'll lead, OK?
I suddenly crave a pretzel.
Okay, which way is forward?
It looked fun on the internet.
This looked a lot hotter in the Kama Sutra.
I love you, but you're a pain in the neck.
What do you think the marriage counselor meant by codependent?
Dammit, Carl!
Our parents were right - we tied the knot way too soon.
Twisted sisters?
Can we go back to being attached at the hip?
Talk about a twisted relationship.
You’ve put me in a difficult position.
Well, evolution's made us look like fools again.
This is nothing  ... you should see the Octopus play Hokey Pokey
I said 'my name is Felix,' not helix.
OK, Let’s try lefty loosey.
We need to consciously uncouple!
No, YOUR left.
I told you I was into KINKY, not TWISTED!!
I think I know now why the lions were circling us.
Your mother was right. We're all screwed up.
IMITATION OF SPAGHETTI ON THE SERENGETI
I know it's uncomfortable, but Ripley's pays way better than these stupid animal parks."
You've become too possessive. I can't breathe.
I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this.
I said I wanted to Tango, not tangle.
I'm still taller than you.
That's the last time we join the zebras for a game of Twister.
This isn’t too bad. Group hugs are the worst.
Our relationship is SO twisted.
There goes that National Geographic drone again.
I said,'Put your LEFT foot in'.
Sometimes I just don’t know which way to turn.
I think it was better being attached at the hip.
The first time is always a little awkward.
Let's put a new twist on our relationship," you said
Am I looking at my butt or yours?
What level was that yoga class we just did?
I think it's righty tighty..lefty lucy
It was cuter in my head.
The problem is once you twist it is difficult to shout.
Is this “second base”?
See?  This is why I just fist bump.
And this is why I hate ballroom dancing.
Let's watch the vultures circling," you said.  "It'll be fun," you said
Wait a sec! It takes two to tangle or two to tango?
Third World problems, amiright??
How about we find a watering hole were we can have a drink and unwind .
I just don't think Dancing with the Stars is for us.
Next time, let's just agree to disagree.
I swore to avoid entanglements
I think we should start seeing other people.
I'm thinking the Camel Sutra wasn't written for us.
I don't think this is how we are supposed to screw.
I don't think we were both supposed to go counter-clockwise!
Nobody told you to make like a double helix, smart ass!
wow,we really can't dance.
I don't see what snakes see in this!
Thanks again for doing this. If this doesn’t make Sharon jealous, I don’t know what will.
Trust me. By this time tomorrow we'll be blowing up Facebook, trending on Twitter and dancing on TV with Ellen.
Wait, your left or mine?
You first.
Learning to unwind could be life-changing.
Are you sure this is how you do the hokey pokey?
You are female right?
Let me rephrase my question..."I'll scratch you're back AFTER you scratch mine..?"
son of a bitch, Greg! you went and wrapped your neck around mine again. This is why you weren't invited to the wedding.
Apparently, it takes two to untango, too.
Excuse me, but you' re in my personal space.
Is this what they meant by “try and see from each other’s perspectives”
I never should have gotten mixed up with you.
...and that, Fred, is how DNA and genes work.
Let's go back to spooning.
Sure, let's play Twister, he says.
Isn't there something else we can do besides necking?
Our situation has knot improved !
No. No. No. It’s ‘NECKTIE’  These tourists are terrible at charades.
Let's try this one more time. My left, your right.
Hey, remember that time you asked if I had lice?
For the last time, no. That spot doesn't look weird to me.
It started with a little innocent necking, then things spiraled out of control.
Sorry, I'm just not that into erotic asphixiation.
I have the right of way!
I think people call it "necking."
Next time let's just hoof-bump.
I simply cannot unwrap my head around it.
You and your Kama Sutra
Now if only we could shout.
Tell me again how this helps us to see the lions.
Let's see the zebras try this one.
Can’t we just try living together for a while without tying the knot?
Do these spots make my butt look big?
We really must have tied one on last night.
We've discovered the secret structure of DNA
Turn right" I said. But no, you just wouldn't listen
Next time we see a dust devil coming, let's try lying down.
It's a long story.
We should exchange insurance information.
The other left.
This is worse than when our retainers got stuck!
You've looked for trees.I've looked for trees. 
I think it's safe to say there are no trees.
Maybe no one will notice.
I told you that Kama Sutra move was way too advanced for us!
Oh great, now the hyena is laughing at us.
Hey Macarena!
When I said "necking", I had something much different in mind.
I can’t tell whether I’m coming or going.
I'll watch my back, you watch yours!
Your mother is right. Our relationship is twisted.
We forgot the champagne glasses.
Is this what screwing is like?  I love it!
Meet Felix and Helix.
I still want a prenup
Ok, I get it! DNA is a double helix.
Can you reach my insurance card?
At least we're not up to our necks in alligators
No more Kama Sutra for us!
It feels just like it did on our first date.
You forgot to grab the champagne flutes!
‘Well at least we’re not reticulated.’
It depends how you look at it.
I thought we went on this trip to unwind!
No sign of the lion on my side.
I told you not to annoy the elephants.
How do we explain this to your parents?
I'm not much of a hugger.
If you are doing this on purpose, please stop.
Let's unwind.
I feel like every time I stick my neck out for you, MY life gets so complicated!
On second thought, I really do need some space.
Now that we've been to a couples therapist I have the feeling we should visit a chiropractor.
I think the Camel Sutra only works for camels.
This is why there's no Kama Sutra for giraffes.
This is the LAST time we watch tennis together
You never give me a chance to just unwind.
No,the lions are this way. No that way. No,this way!
This is not what I had in mind, when I asked for a neck tie for my birthday
Oh wait, we forgot the glasses.
Our love has spiraled out of control
I say next time let's stick to spooning.
Before Trump this only used to happen in cartoons!
"Before you came along, I managed to avoid entanglements"
Quick, I think your mother's coming.
Easy, Kevin. This is my first time.
Ok now, wait for the music and then it's two steps forward two steps back...you first.
I'm sorry Bernie, I thought necking would help you unwind.
I said necktie, not neck tie.
This double helix research is a pain in the neck.
Well, there goes the Lion King audition.
Tell me again , this proves what?
This twisted, screwed up love of ours can be a pain in the neck, but I just can't leave you.
So good to be around you again!
Remember, All we have to do is relax and everything will straighten out"
You always take a good thing too far.
This is why I usually date horses.
I THINK I've got your back.
Could you just scratch behind my right ear?
If we were in the southern hemisphere would we twist the other way?
You’re paranoid, Jerry. Nobody’s following you.
What now, my love?
Let’s see Darwin explain this
Neck Lace
Don't look now, but there's a pack of hyenas behind one of us.
Screw you!
No, screw you!!
This may be a bad time, but I'm pregnant and it's yours.
Namaste away from me next time I do upward facing dog.
So this is how we’ll eat the wedding cake?
Looks like we’re in a bind.
Are you sure that you are ready to tie the knot?
Trust me", you said.  "What could possibly go wrong?...."
I don't think we're doing it right.
Veterinarians can use this as their symbol!
Is this a bad time to mention that I'm actually looking for something more casual?
Seriously David, this is the last time we try something from the Kama Sutra.
This is the last time I stick my neck out for you.
You are definitely testing my boundaries here, buddy
'Sweet!' What does mine say?!
Try couples yoga, they said. It’ll unwind you, they said.
You said you didn't want to be joined at the hip.
Necking was a lot less complicated when I was younger.
This is really twisted, Sister!
Can't say mom didn't warn me about the dangers of necking.
One two three four...I declare a neck war
Listen, I don't know, but how do we creatively uncouple?
Give it up!
We will never make it to the synchronized swimming team.
This way we save on scarves.
Frankly, I always imagined necking to be more enjoyable.
If you think this is bad, you should see the camels humping.
I knew we'd end up together. It's in our DNA.
Our therapist was right, it's not healthy to have our lives completely intertwined.
Let's go have a highball to unwind.
Listen, Bob, I'm having second thoughts about tying the knot.
Wait, I see my ex coming.
This is so much worse than a hickey.
That was the trick.
My hiccups are gone!
Let’s not play that other Chubby Checker record.
OK, one last time:  paper, scissors, neck.
This is the last time I let you lead.
When you said you were going to show me how the French do it, I didn't think you meant braid.
Marco.....Polo.
Hey, am I looking at your ass or mine??
Mama told me necking would get me in trouble.
I know it doesn't look exactly like it does in the Camel Sutra book...
You’re taking this ‘one good turn deserves another’ a bit too far, Gladys.
Yeah, I've got your back -- if that's your back.
Is that a python in your throat, or are you just glad to see me?
Gives new meaning to "neck and neck," eh?
Maybe checking each other for ticks wasn't such a great idea after all.
On second thought, let's not screw.
And that, my dear, is how you play Twister.
Don't Back Up!!
Is it as hard for you to unwind as it is for me?
I don't care how it happened---let's go to Happy Hour and unwind!
You never ask for directions
I hate the hokey pokey.
I say we're neck and neck!
I think I have a knot in my neck.
The original necktie!
I know you're cold but next time I'm buying you a scarf.
I told you, left is loose —right is tight.
I just don't think our tango lessons are paying off
I think its "hearts" intertwined.
You have a really twisted sense of humor!
I'm glad we tried your little experiment, Geoffrey, but I prefer doing yoga by myself.
Why do you think they call it necking?
This is seriously twisted.
Do you see what I see?
This is why we don't play twister, Steve.
This is why I wanted to take dance lessons before the wedding.
Best two out of three?
Stop looking over my shoulder all the time!
Why won’t you look at me?!
I'd say the bigger problem is the lack of trees.
This is Africa -- it’s going to take a lot to drag me away from you.
We should have tied the knot a long time ago.
The French braid was hotter.
Uh, okay I guess. How is it for you?
This is not my idea of necking.
So much for necking.
I’m glad to see you, but not that glad.
I hate it when they play Chubby Checker.
And that is what the DNA molecule looks like.
At least our hickeys will just blend in.
It doesn't look like you have lice which come to think of it I'm pretty happy about
That's the last time I'm doing the hokey-pokey with you.
It takes two to tangle.
I thought necking would be more fun.
I love you. I love you more. I love you most. Where are you?
I'm going to swipe right, you swipe left.
A handshake would've been so much simpler!
It's a draw.  We are neck and neck!
Mom, it’s community college...I’ll be home for dinner.
Can we just be friends
We should probably head home now.  Wouldn't want anyone to catch us necking.
We have to stop following the drone cameras.
Maybe we should unwind.
I said "Clockwise!"
Nope, I still have the hiccups.
No, MY clockwise!!
From now on, we stick to the secret handshake.
Let me guess. This is your first date?
Either we declare peace or we spend the weekend staring at our own asses.
Are you dating anyone else at the moment?
Just relax. If you want Instagram followers, this is what it takes.
OK. I'm ready to go home and unwind.
One more twist and we make it into the Guinness book of records.
That's it! No more polkas!
Endless love.
Maybe the lions will think we're a statue.
Okay, big shot. Now who's going to post this on Instagram?
Why can't we just say hello?
Bless you...
Great. The hyenas are really going to laugh at us now, Phil.
This happens every time we watch tennis.
Well, the first few dance lessons were fun.
Honey! You’re home early!
Ouch, I've got a Crick and Watson in my neck!"
Does this spot look weird to you?
Our relationship has had its twists and turns, but now we see things from two entirely different directions.
Necking has always been over-rated.
Maybe we should just stick to a fist bump.
I said, MY left, Steve.
Are you sure this is how it’s done?
Not sure if this is appropriate public display of affection.
Let's tie the knot.
why did I ever want to get tangled up with you ?
Next week let’s try the Watusi.
Right hoof, Orange
I thought first base meant a kiss.
Once again, I've forgotten what we were even fighting about.
Was that a hiccup I just felt?
Next time, let me lead.
That's the last time I  play tetherball with you.
No, your other left!
I feel dizzy. Do you feel dizzy?
Uh...which one am I again?
It's not my fault, our therapist recommended we try new things.
Sorry, honey, but I just can't seem to get my head around this.
I need somebody to come over here and cut his head off.
Let's try again.  Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty.
That was easy. Let's try a square knot!
Unwinding quantum entanglement? Ask Einstein.
Twister:Wildlife Edition
I don’t care if you thought it was cute on Instagram, Gladys.
Maybe check the Kama Sutra again...
This is just knot working for me.
Don't worry, I've got your back.
Is this what the humans call necking?
Is the election over yet?
I always thought necking was overrated
It looks exactly the same from this side.
I always thought ‘necking’ would be more fun
Ok now...right hoof, green.
Did you just hear a lion?
Let's face it, it takes two to tangle
So much for coming to the desert to unwind
Don’t you just hate safe sex?
I think we should go back to just being friends.
Inexperienced giraffes make out for the first time.
I don't usually neck on the first date.
I don't think we've ever been closer.
Survived that tornado!
And to your left,” bellowed Sam the Safari Guide, “You’ll find an aesthetically camouflaged cell phone tower!”
I told you, let’s not twist again like we did last summer.
Come on baby, stop complaining. You’ve got the twist. Now you just gotta shout!
Remember, lefty loosey righty tighty.
I like you, Louis, but I'm not so fond of this necking idea.
Ok, so high-fives and fist bumps are passé, you say. But this just feels stupid.
you always hear about it but never think its gonna be you
I don't think this is how you do it.
I know we want to spice things up, but maybe the Kama Sutra is an ambitious start.
I had thought necking would be more fun.
Ready. Set. Go! Left, right, cha-cha-cha.
I think Dr. Schmidt might have a point about codependency.
I blame you." 
"No, I blame Darwin.
Yeah...right! ‘Let’s play Twister. It’ll be fun’!
Let’s just go have a drink and unwind.
Couples yoga?  Really?
I keep getting into twisted relationships.
Act natural. He’s looking this way.
Wonderful, Now What?
Are you sure you read the right description in the Kama Sutra?
No, your right, your right!
You wouldn't understand it - it's a giraffe thing!
No more Kama Sutra by memory, Stanley.
We never should have tried couples yoga
No, not a great first date.
I said right left,pivot,then one step backwards,forward on the right foot to a stall. Who taught you how to dance,Spicer.
I know what a pretzel is, Larry
So I guess the threesome is a no-go.
No, first we unwind, then we have a drink before dinner.
It's only our first date so we don't quite have it down.
First base!
Consciously uncoupling is gonna be harder than I thought.
I don't know? It was an old song by some guy named Chubby Checker!
Do you think they liked our routine?
Date night. Hidden love notes. Spontaneous necking. We've tried everything in that damn book. I still want a divorce.
This takes screwing up to a whole new level.
I cannot overstate how carefully we have to do this....
Are you sure this is necking?
They're neck in neck coming into the turn. Oh man, it looks like they're all tied up.
It's my first time too.
This isn't as arousing as I'd hoped it to be
Are you sure this is how you play Twister?
Once more around for the World’s Record.
I never liked playing Twister.
Tornados on the Serengeti..damn global weather change...
So .... do ya think this is “for better” or “for worse”?
Clearly you don't understand how Twister works.
Are you seriously trying to explain counter-clockwise to a giraffe?
My Mom warned me that necking would get me into trouble.
Sometimes I don't know where I end and you begin
Have you ever just stood and watched the vultures circle 'round,
...and wondered why?
I told you, Jenny. It takes two to tango but three to un-tango.
Forget "The Twist", we're doing the "Chicken Song" at the wedding.
Let's just back up slowly
I'm concerned we're falling into a pattern.
Your turn.
We must never speak of this.
Careful! We don't want to end up in a Dr. Seuss book.
Maybe a firm handshake, next time?
It's not working.   HICCUP!!
You seriously thought this was going to be romantic?
Next time, let's just stick to a bear hug.
It doesn't feel the same as how we twisted last summer.
And to think, I laughed when my parents warned me against necking !
I do so hate these meetings where neckties are compulsory.
Are you sure this will intimidate poachers?
This is the last time I'm playing Twister with you.
Couples Yoga - Never Again!!!
It was your idea to start necking on our first date.
This isn't what I meant when I said, "let's celebrate & get twisted!!"
Do you have any idea how much my osteopath is going to charge me?
how many giraffe does it take to change a lightbulb?
Where was  I? .  . .
I think we took that last curve a little  fast.
This body under my head ... is it mine or yours?
When I said we need to get our heads around matters , this wasn’t exactly what I meant.
This is the problem with Giraffe Sumo: it’s always neck and neck.
All I asked you to do was blow in my ear.
Sweetheart, are you feeling a little clingy today??
OK, so you brought the selfie stick this time, right?
I always knew I would wind up with someone like you.
Say, which one of these bodies is mine?
All right, next time let’s just do rock, paper, scissors.
Our interpretation of the DNA helix is sure to win first prize!
A neckrub seemed like a good idea at first.
I think this calls for conscience uncoupling.
This didn’t happen the last time we did the Hokey Pokey.
No more marriage counselors from Groupon.
I didn’t know you were so kinky.
Let's just go back to doggy style.
I see Russia.”  “I see Alabama.
Let me know if you see a lion
After this fiasco, we are going to need some time to unwind.
I guess this means we're dining together tonight.
This is not what I meant when I said kinky
On three we close our eyes and shimmy to the left.
This puts a twist in our relationship.
We'll just have to tell your wife we tripped and fell.
You give the best hugs.
Now that was one heck of a wind gust.
That’s the last time we stand next to each other while watching a helicopter.
Giraffe family game night: Twisters
What part of ‘I’ll go left, you go right’ didn’t you understand?”
I told you, necking at our age was a bad idea!
Why do humans think necking is fun?
I'm not up to this level of commitment.
I guess it's not an old wives tale after all.
Kissing cheeks more than twice isn't necessary.
For the last time, look to your left, not my left.
The invitation said neck tie required!
Tell me you've at least necked before.
Let's twist and shout.
Am I seeing my ass or yours?
Millions of years of evolution has led to this moment.
This is the last time I play Twister with you.
First Toys "R'" Us and now THIS.
See, I told you. We’re in the Northern Hemisphere so it’s clockwise.
And you're certain this is in the Kama Sutra.
Why don't we just look at a map!
And did Dr. Ruth have any suggestions about how to undo this?
Proof that necking leads to entanglements
This Co-dependency thing has gone too far.
How about trying your other left?
Oh, Frank, don’t be such a prude! The Kama Sutra says this position promotes erotic vitality and spiritual unity.
Life’s full of twists and turns.
We'd better stop. The hyenas are laughing.
You call this a Heimlich?
It's been a long day, let's grab dinner and unwind.
My mother told me if we started necking how we would wind up!
Humans call it necking.
I just don’t get the “necking” thing.
why giraffes don't neck
So what brings you to my neck of the woods?
Don't tell HR about this.
I said let's meet for a tryst, not a twist.
The lion was running circles around us.
Last time I'll try to kiss a dyslexic
Ready for Conscious Uncoupling, yet?
Do you think this is what Chubby Checker meant??
I'm starting to think my friends are right about our co-dependency issues.
What now?
This is why we don't cuddle.
Made you look
Caduceus got nothing on us, baby.
Ok, this time I go left and you go right
Your "other" left, Sidney, turn to your other left!
No more using G.P.S.
No. Your other right.
Where exactly in the Kama Sutra did you find THIS?
Are you open to trying a braid?
This isn’t working for me.
I signed on for "a little kinky"---not "totally twisted"!
Next time that drone circles around us, let's move away from each other.
I said snuggle,not strangle,you idiot!
At least we didn't get our braces stuck this time.
Wait!  Who amI?
We've gone round and round and still can't see eye to eye.
I'm so glad that we're not turtles.
Let's take some time off to unwind
That’ll be the last time we watch a tennis match together.
I don't understand neck ties.
When I said I liked physical touch, this is knot what I meant...
We should have tried acupuncture first.
This isn't what i meant by necking.
Dont forget to use the 'safe word' if you start feeling uncomfortable...
Do you think the spider gone now?
Unwinding is easy. You just put your right hoof in...
I thought I was going to zig and you were going to zag...
“Hyenas, where? Oh yeah. Sorry. Forgot that’s our safe word.”
OK, let's try this again; first you put your two knees close up tight.
Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into.
Maybe we aren't ready for western swing.
How was it for you?
Now let’s try the half hitch.
Maybe a bit less necking next time
Gary, I said MY right!
My parents say we're too wrapped up in each other and should see other giraffes, but I love only you.
You, me, in the middle of nowhere, it’s a twist of fate.
Ok forget the twist. Let’s salsa instead.
This is the last time I stick my neck out there for you
Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into.
We should have done this after we mated.
I would call it a tie.
We need to re-think the rules to Twister.
It's not love, but it's the neck's best thing.
Wow.  What a kiss.
Maybe pilates would be better than yoga
Honey, we totally nail couples yoga.
I love you, too, but you're choking me.
Your left?...or mine?
I thought love meant never having to say you're sorry.
Am I me or you?
Sorry.  My last significant other was a boa constrictor.
""Did we do it? Are we camouflaged?"
I said my left  - that would be your right!
Well, this is strange twist of events.
How is this romantic?
And there -- the double helix of the DNA molecule.
Where's the cartoonist who put us in this mess?
I could never leave you.
My mother warned me you were the clinging sort.
I'm getting tired of these photo opps for the tourists!
This 'mating ritual' thing is getting ridiculous.
This relationship is spiraling out of control.
It's two to Tango! Tango!
Maybe doing ‘The Twist’ wasn’t such 
a good idea after all, Ned!
Stop saying, "Lion on the right!" when when we are necking.
Tell your wife you have to stay late at work.
Let's just skip the foreplay.
I don't know if I'm a Liberal with conservative leaning or a  Conservative who always looks to the left.
We are never going to make any kids this way.
I still don't get it.  Can you just explain it to me instead?
No kissing on the first date. But necking is fine.
Come on!  It's Righty tighty,Lefty Loosey.
Come on baby, let's do the twist.
Where did that mosquito go?
Do you think we’re codependent?
Ummm, I think we're supposed to watch EACH OTHER'S back...
Tying the knot.
Is this considered second base?
I’m leaving you, Bob. You’re too clingy.”
I don't think this is necking, Gerome.
Our DNA is a perfect match.
Do you still want a pre-nuptial?
I think you misread the Kama Sutra
I blame Chubby Checker.
You think I'm wrong?! Why else would we have long necks?!
Next time, I go right, you go left.
Two heads are better then one is so overrated.
I told you to get the illustrated Kamasutra.
We need to read our Camel Sutra more carefully.
We are not entangled. FAKE NEWS!
No, the other-other-other left!
I think they call this a ‘Double Helix’!
It was your idea to tie the knot.
Just relax! You're all wound up
It's knotty, but nice.
I say it’s a wrap!
Jeezus,Gertrude.  When I turn right - YOU - turn right.
That bird was flying around in circles on purpose!
I meant 'my left'.
All of a sudden, I have a great idea for
a game for both kids and adults.
The Kama Sutra isn't for us.
No, I said, "YOU go left and I go right."
I always knew our lives were intertwined, but this is really twisted, sister!
Are we both watching the same bird circling overhead?
Is this how Watson and Crick did it?
Don't you think that it would be easier if we each just looked behind ourselves
Maybe we should go back to the hoof bump.
I put my neck out there for you, and you repay me with this?
Now this time keep your ears out ‘till we’re airborne!
We just can't keep going around together!
Now, try lifting your left hind foot.
You have a twisted sense of humor!
We should not be following those circling buzzards.
I think this necking stuff is not so great for our species.
Nothing in any direction.  I think we're good.
Let's not unwind at breakneck speed.
Our couples therapist DID say we were too enmeshed.
You kept saying "Look the other way"
At last, I can see your perspective.
Now listen to me very carefully. When I count to three I’ll go left and you go right.
I told you.  Anything but the Tango.
Now show me your wiener!
I knew we would wind up with each other!
But no one knows what a caduceus is!
Perhaps this isn't the best time, but I'd like a divorce.
Your first time necking?
Somebody screwed up.
Let's re-read that chapter of the Kama Sutra of Necking.
...alright, now shout!
This foreplay stuff is killing me.
Mom! We were just necking!
Righty tightly, lefty loosey. Basic screwing, George.
It’s not me. It’s you.
Man, that was a hellava dust devil!!
Sorry, Dad, I'm getting someone else to teach me the Windsor.
And then when she asks him to hold her closer, he says "If I hold you any closer I'll be in back of you!"
My therapist said doing this for 10 minutes after mating is supposed to release oxytocin and bring us closer.
Now was not the best time to tell me that you think of yourself as a male!
Now that we've twisted, let's shout!
Go right
We will be fine. Just relax and enjoy the moment.
Wait! Where'd we put the wine glasses?
Charlie dear, 'IS THIS ALL THERE IS?'
I'm not watching tennis with you anymore
I knew it! You've been seeing a boa constrictor!
We should order 23andMe.
Come on baaaby...let's un-do the twist.
We're confusing 'neck romancing' with 'necromancy'.
We're screwed.
This is why we don't go to parties.
Did we follow the instructions?
Maybe Trump Jr. won't recognize us this way.
I think it was a tornado!
Next time let's just bump horns.
Are you certain the American Medical Association wants a new logo?
I just adore your scarf!
Was it good for you too?
I guess this means we have to get married.
I find your need for affection hard to swallow.
I told you I hate ballroom dancing!
See! I told you I have a bald spot.
I think I feel a sore throat coming on.
Honey, I think it's time for us to unwind.
We shouldn’t have started that protest to bring Toys R Us back after all.
Is that your ass getting fat or mine?
This is a real Giraffic jam.
So students, this is what a double helix looks like.
You often seem out of reach but I think we’ve established a nexus.
Damn!  It's still not a Moebius strip!
Now just relax and we will be airborne
Ok, look down. Now try to move your front right leg
Let's try couple's Pilates next time.
A  first kiss can be awkward.
Where's David Attenborough when you actually need him?
If this doesn’t get 30 likes in 10 minutes, I’m deleting it.
Yes, below the equator a vortex spins clockwise!
not on the first date!
Two heads are better than one
I don't think this was covered in couples therapy.
Let's call the whole thing off.
Ok so we're married, now what?
Humans call it necking, too-- but what do THEY know?"
We're overdue for some time to unwind.
Are we too enmeshed?
Humans make these murder-suicides look so easy.
Well, this is embarrassing.
Not again!
Now do you understand why I don't like to play Twister?
How about next time we knit each other scarves instead?
We have to stop meeting like this.
I can’t feel my feet.
It was a light bulb joke, not a research directive.
I don’t care if it *is* your favorite game — Twister sucks.
This time, you go YOUR left!
Now what do we do?
We'll never see eye to eye like this.
Make up your mind! Which direction do you want to go in?!
The Rare Pretzel Giraffe has become endangered trying to figure out how to mate
I just don't think true love means you have to be inseparable.
Didn't I tell you to take it easy on the medicinal marijuana?
I didn't really mean I would wring your neck
So you think you can dance?
Wait, now I think there was something about setting up a pole with some ribbons first.
Just say, We are all  tied up
It’s not that I don’t love you. I just need a little space.
It would be so much easier to make promises if we had pinkies.
I wished they’d warned us about this in sex-ed.
I really mean it. If you post this on Facebook,I'll never talk to you again.
Oh dear! The children are watching.
But I saw it in the Kama Sutra, honey!
This is what I get for sticking my neck out for you.
We'll just tell your parents that there was a tornado.
Well, this is another fine mess you got us into, Olie!
If this works, it'll be a Heimlich world record!
Who put on "Let's Twist Again Like We Did Last Summer?"
I have the sneaking suspicion we're in a New Yorker cartoon.
I’d suggest we go for a drink, but they just banned straws.
What's your exit strategy?
Hell of a wind, huh?
I wonder why they call it necking.
Origin of the term: "rubbernecking"
I think this will redefine "necking" for generations to come.
I think I'm about to kiss myself.
I do worry that we may be a bit codependent.
Are you part boa or python?
No, you move first!
We need to tell our parents.
Dammit! This happens every time we play Chubby Checker!
When you said, “One good turn deserves another,’ I knew we were made for each other.
Mama warned me that necking leads to trouble.
I'd say this counts as endangered.
Remind me, are we north or south of the Equator?
Is this twisted love?
My therapist said that we are codependent.
Did you hear that?
Next time, can we try my approach to mating?
Let's just take this slow" you said. "Let's just wrap our heads around this" you said
Are you sure this is what the therapist meant?
Gawd, this would never happen if I were a leopard.
Next time only one of us should go in for the kiss
I said DON'T look now!
I knew a tennis match was a bad idea!
You better hope that damn proverb writer doesn't see this.
Okay. Swans, we're not.
To the right. My right, not your right!
Right,  not a good idea to walk and text.
This isn't going to work, we can't even neck right.
I can’t wrap my head around it.
I can't tell if I am looking at my ass or yours.
Carl, I told we should have asked for directions!
Next time, let's just do a hoof bump!
I really think we need to start seeing other giraffes.
Okay, clockwise next time?
What is it that you don't understand about counter-clockwise?
When I said, "Let's tie the knot," I only meant...
We just made a double helix!
No ! for the last time, your bum doesn't look big at any angle!
This takes rubber necking to a new height!
You go left and I’ll go right and let’s see if we can hokey pokey our way out of this mess.
Those lions will think twice before messing with us now.
So glad I found someone my height
I still can't figure out why humans think necking is so hot.
Am I looking at my butt or your butt?
You’re great.  It’s just...I’m starting to feel a bit strangled in this relationship.
Excuse me sir, do you have a second to talk about our lord and saviour
Wait, wait. Let’s just stop and think about this.
I could have been somebody, but no--I had to get tangled up with you.
So much for tetherball!
We are so royally screwed.
My mother warned me about getting mixed up with you.
Whoever called it necking obviously wasn't a giraffe
Who knew necking could get this kinky?
Lion at eight o'clock.
It was simpler when we just touched noses.
As if we didn’t look ridiculous enough already.
I think I prefer goat yoga.
STOP.  You've kissed me on both cheeks already.
This was romantic idea at first but now it's just twisted.
Classic example of the Giraffic error.
Are you sure this is how necking works?
I'm telling you. That's how helicopters work.
Do you think Mom will notice?"
They must be lost.  They've been driving in circles for hours.
How many times have I told you not to use that GPS device?
I dig science but I just don't see long necks as an evolutionary advantage.
As the largest prey around here, this seems a bit indulgent.
Maybe just thumb wrestle instead?
Ok, now we're necking . .. how do we do the tongue thing?
This can't be what Chubby Checker had in mind.
See, this is what happens when you try to fight me over that last leaf.
I don't think this is 'reverse cowgirl. '
This is a little too kinky for me, darling.
I think I will take a break and unwind.
He went thataway...no, thataway...no, thataway...
I told you, no necking.
I don't think swing works for us. Let's just stick to ballroom.
Can we chat later? I am a bit tied up at the moment.
No, no, it's wrapped around your little finger.
You're talking in circles again.
Oh yeah! That hit the spot :)
If he asks us to walk a straight line next, we’re screwed.
My love, I don´t know where I end and you start.
One good turn deserves another.
I don't think this is what our human meant when he said he liked neck ties.
I forget.  Am I me or you?
It started with a kiss, but we got carried away.
I told you that these tango lessons were not a great idea.
maybe we shouldn't go back to partner yoga
It seemed like you would never stop talking, and I panicked...
We’re still in our honeymoon phase.
Counter clockwise!! I said!
Giraffe Neck Tie
I thought the twist was a dance
Let's grab a drink and unwind.
I thought you had the champagne glasses!
Now I know why mom always warned me about necking.
Please, Bernard, this is only our first date!
Oh, wait, your left or my left?
Next time, lets wait until the tornado passes before we try to eat!
Two heads may be better than one, but this is ridiculous!
Oh THAT bird?!
Enough with the Tango class, lets try the FoxTrot
Maybe it said "counter-clockwise"?
I’m sure the vet has seen other animals in way more compromising positions!
Don't fart.
One of us is excessively needy.
I'm not sure we can get out of this one.
Your left, not mine!
Really? Do we have to do this every time Chubby Checker comes on?
I hate team-building exercises.
I sort of like this “necking” thing.
No. No. No. I said counterclockwise.
Did you see that? Our little girl 
learned to somersault!
I said go right, not left!
Ready for takeoff?
The two were neck-and-neck and ended up in a tie.
Spotted Necking
I don’t know.  I just can’t wrap my head around it.
You're a real pain in the neck, you know that?
Well this is a gir-gaffe.
I think I prefer the missionary position.
I guess we’re due for another visit to the chiropractor.
it’s complicated
I still don't see how the goats had a better audition for the yoga gig.
Stop twisting my words.
You know our therapist said we have to do it for 10 minutes a day,Geoffrey.
Let's stick to waltz.
Necking is one thing, but you're not getting to second base!
I told you we shouldn't neck!
It's OK, but we'd look more professional in a half-Windsor.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't do this. I have a boyfriend.
Forget it Harold,Giraffes can't hug."
How many more times will Chubby Checker say 'twist again?'
I really like you, Brad, but I don’t think we’re doing this right.
They finally tied the knot.
This is not what was meant when I said, “Let’s tie one on.”
High five!
I feel like a politician
I didn't know this is what you meant by 'let's tie the knot'.'"
How do we explain this to the kids?
You think you're so smart!  But this is not a double helix.
Thank you.  Now that I'm clear on the structure of DNA, do you know a good chiropractor?
Now, let's uncanoodle.
OK, now let's just back away from each other, VERY slowly.
So this is your idea of a twisted fantasy
Dad, I can explain!
I don’t think this is what they mean by necking, Gilbert.
We must rethink our hugs.
And that, my dear, is what they will call double helix .
Call 911?  Didn't you see how they made a meme out of those snakes?
You stay put, and I'll try to unwind.
I think I've got a Crick in my neck.
'Next time, let's just wave goodbye instead.'
Never the twine shall meet!
Can we try petting instead?
Sometimes I just want to skip the foreplay.
Let me know when you're about to sneeze!
No, no, no! Move to your other left.
Trust me, interpretive dance is in my blood!
If you do that again, I'm going to wring your neck!
But it was totally worth it!
Do you think we’re getting too enmeshed?
You weren't paying close attention during sex ed, were you?
Are we 'doin' it' yet?
Ok, you got me hooked.
I told you necking would get us into trouble.
Maybe we should move our relationship beyond necking.
''That's the last time we take square dancing lessons from a lefty."
You lead, I'll follow
Wait, this isn't how a neck scarf works?
You really have some twisted sense of humor.
This is the last time that I am sticking my neck out for you!
Maybe 'necking' just isn't for Giraffes....
Giraffe heimlich
Hold on a second. This time you go right and I go left.
If commitment is what you wanted I could have just given you a ring.
Couldn't we just kiss without necking?
My mother warned me necking might lead to screwing, but I just thought she was overprotective.
When you said you wanted to neck, I thought.....
I've got your back!
Maurice and Zoe lost themselves and their inhibitions twisting the night away
I couldn’t find the Users Manual.  Dumbbell, they’re always on the Internet now.  Did you remember the password?
That's the last time I let you whisper in my  ear!
You need to unwind .
Is it on your left or my left?
You’ve gotea learn to unwind.
That's not what I meant when I said "let's wrap this up".
Frank, this is not what I had in mind when you asked me to go for a spin.
I said 'your other right' at least three times!
Wiggle your tail for me,will ya? Couldn't tell which body is mine.
When I told you I was into rap, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
I am tired with just necking. Let's go all the way
This takes necking to a whole new height.
F-1 like Hell!  That had to be an F-3!
Let's try an allemande left.
I don't think this is what necking means.
Forget the twist, let’s just shout.
You've got to stop throwing yourself at me!
#twistedsister
Bend it to the left, I said, dammit! If you can't get the choreography down soon, we can kiss that Argentine tango trophy good-bye!
It didn't work.  The lion is headed right for us.
Now we're screwed!
This is not what I thought you meant when you said you wanted to "tie the knot."
And then we dab
This is worse than when we had braces.
I think we're neck and neck!
Or we could have just looked over our own shoulders."
We may have to revisit that cool Rasta braiding app
SILLY, NOW WE CAN'T KISS.
I know it's a stretch, but let's go cheek to cheek.
Oh no! I forgot the champagne!
Next time, I'll bring the tantra book rather than recreating this from memory.
That was fun, but I need to unwind a little now.
Natural selection, my ass!
I’ll never leave you—how could I?
Do you want to lead or follow?
Whose left? Yours?
Actually, I had something else in mind when I said I wanted to neck.
Our relationship has always been a bit screwed up."
That's the last tennis tournament I ever go to.

I wish the company would go necktie optional.
What’s so much fun about necking?
see? it’s too much, we can’t feed each other the cake at the wedding.
My mom warned me about necking.
so you're a gemini too
No, I said 'tryst' again like we did last summer!
Either this "necking" is way overrated or we're just not doing it right.
No more Kama Sutra.
Ummm, yeah ... I love you, too.
Oh Dot, I feel that our DNA are a perfect match!
Is this what the phrase, " to tie the knot "means?
He went thataway
No, it's your turn to curtsy, and my turn to bow.
I told you it should be the other way !
Do you happen to remember which body is yours?
This why our parents warned us about the dangers of premarital necking!
I told you those Swing Dance lessons were a bad idea!
Sorry, I got carried away explaining the DNA helix.
Is this what they call a knotty relationship?
Did you just burp or did I?
We can just tell the others we went to a couples yoga class.
Bonus points if you can tell which body is yours!
You had to drag me on those stupid Teacups!
Now...wiggle your left ear
No. My left, your right Susan!
We gotta stop watching these candidates debates!
Let’s do ‘the twist,’ you said...’it will be fun,’ you said.
I said right. Turn right!
Woah! Are you sure this is in the Karma Sutra?
I told you we shouldn't eat snakes.
Clyde, I love you, too. But I can't breathe.
I don't think you quite grasped the concept of 'necking'".
You're suffocating me
I knew we’d get into trouble if we started necking.
Maybe a fist bump is the way to go.
Next time I'll lead.
I understand that you want to take things slowly in this relationship but your “ necking only’ stance has me tied in knots.
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...
Look here.  Look there.  Look here.
If this is what you meant by necking, I'm not a fan

Righty tighty, lefty loosey ?
Dam that mosquito!
Now we know why vultures circle.
Is that YOUR left, or MY left, Mr. Loosey?
Did you bring protection?"
Quick. Look this up on youtube.
Oh god, don’t look at us DON’T LOOK AT US!
My mother told me there was another way.
Please! Please do not leave me!
You’re sure this is what the therapist meant about wrapping our heads around the other’s issues?
I think We should just forget about 'Dancing with the Stars'.
Codependency? What's that?
Let's NOT twist again.
This is why we don't play Twister.
Couldn't we just skip the foreplay?
You've choked the love right out of me!
Was that a tornado or a water spout?
That’s the last time we let the Zebra’s pick Twister  for game night
Jean Baptiste Lamarck would be totally approving of this.
I think maybe we should think about  slowing things down for now.
Extreme necking
Are you sure this is the way to play “loves me loves me knot”?
Let's go back to petting, Hon. All this necking is killing me...
In my neck of the woods this means we are engaged!
Kiss me!
No Geoffrey! Turn to YOUR left!!!
Are you ready to tie the knot?
You’re right. Doesn’t turn me on either
Just remember, you drink and 
I eat.
No, I go left, then YOU go right!
I'm afraid I win again,Beatrice.
Now, let's see if we can synchronize​ the footwork!
I don't see anyone ... do you see anyone?
You were the one who suggested trying something new, twisted and kinky!
All clear on my side.
This must be your first time necking!
I told you not to buy the Kama Sutra at IKEA!
Knot again dude!
Perhaps we should try petting.
Did you just fart?
Damn! It's that northern-southern hemisphere thing again.
I just don’t get necking.
I would have preferred couples counseling.
This looks like a good place to unwind.
What do they mean by codependency?
Mom always said that necking leads to trouble!!
This work for you?
Your perfume is irresistible.
Maybe that camel sutra book was a bad idea...
Let's face it, Henry, when it comes to dancing we have two left necks.
You call this pas de deux? I say it's pas de don't!
this is the last time we're playing twister
How are your hiccups now?
You’re always right!
Next time, I want to be the big spoon.
Chubby Checker made it sound like a lot more fun.
At the count of three turn to the left and keep turning till I say  STOP.
This is why I don’t like to dance.
I thought you said "lefty-loosey"?
This foreplay is a little twisted.
Now can we ask for directions?

Yes folks, two giraffes necking, do you have a problem with that?
What comes after necking?
I think we scared the bee away.
Who knew nibbling your ear could be this complicated.
Sorry but I just can't wrap my head around it.
If you sneeze I'll kick you from here to Sunday.
Well, that tornado sure came out of left field.
Let's un-twist again, like we did last summer.
We can't both go clockwise.
Hi there, we're here for the siamese twin discount you have advertised..."
No, no, no, move to your left not my left.
We've got to establish some boundaries.
I never realized that you're a leftie too!
Now, THIS is quintessential necking!
Thanks for looping me in.
Reading the Kama Sutra at our age was a bad idea.
I'm all twisted up outside.
Actually, Albert, I would have preferred just an 'I love you'.
I'm sick of your twisted sense of humor.
I always thought necking would be more pleasurable.
Not sure, but I think this is what they call codependent.
The bad news is a lion is coming. The good news is that we're about to finally figure out whose body is whose.
Wait, I have to sneeze!
Is this what you had in mind when you answered my ad?
This isn't what I had in mind when I asked for a necktie.
Is this love... or codependency?
It was little wonder when the boa giraffe went extinct.
This isn’t what I meant when I said I wanted to screw you.
I did not see that twist coming.
Um... help?
Can we talk ?
Maybe we should reassess our definition of healthy boundaries.
How's this, Mr. Attenborough?
You're sure the therapist said doing this would improve our ability to relate to each other?
I think we missed a step in our tango...
You could have just explained the double helix!
Are you as turned on as I am?
Sorry, I am all neck on the dance floor
You spin me round and round...
Is this the dance they call the tangle?
Now we both walk backwards and get the best neck crack ever!
Maybe we should drop necking from our foreplay.
Anything coming on your side?
I prefer counter clockwise necking
This is not what I had in mind when I said I was into necking
Let's just hold hands next time!
Whiplash.
Whaddya say we kick back and unwind?
I'm trying to wrap my head around our relationship.

We keep screwing up.
This time we can blame revolution, not evolution.
This is why I hate playing Twister.

It's not you. I'm just not ready to get entangled in a new relationship right now.
You’re a pain in the neck.
Left foot on blue again?

Necking is complicated.
So much for the do-si-do.
I told you we shouldn’t eat the pythons.
Honey,with foreplay like this we'll never have a baby.
It takes two to tango, not tangle.
Are you a licenced chiropractor?
Now that we've tied the knot, where to honeymoon?

So, who's the little spoon?

I wish you’d stop it!  They’re starting to call us the ‘Twisted Sisters’.

Did we tie the knot or not?
How could two GPS apps be so different?

Look at what?
What's the harm in a little necking?" you said..

Nothing to see here. Stop rubbernecking.
Your idea of love is a bit twisted.
This is the last time we play Twister!

No, Janet, this is not what I meant by necking.'
Well, this is a pain in the neck...
Keep looking.
Do the Twist' is a dumb song
The worst part is I dropped my cellphone.
Necking is fine, but without hands, there won't be any petting.
My therapist says we are co-dependent.
Wow. Rubbernecking really IS hazardous.
Did you remember the light bulb?
Sometimes I just feel like my life is spiraling out of control.
Yeah, I guess this is one way to scare off the lions.
That is the LAST time we dance to Chubby Checker.
No, my right.
My dear, I think we’re a little bit too entwined.
Shhhh! Is that your cell or mine?
What do you mean you need space?
Don't you just hate those sudden dust devils?
Isn't it time for a kiss?
Maybe they were right.
This is a twisted relationship.
It is great necking, but isn't it time for dinner?
I don't feel anything, do you?
i’m sorry, which body did you say was mine?
Clearly, the Kama Sutra was not written for us.
Any sign of him in your direction, Jim?
Codependency.

This relationship is twisted!
Let's admit it...it's a bit of a twisted relationship.
I think we need to break up.
Love hurts.
I'm still wrapping my head around what you just said.
I guess we carried necking a little too far.
This time you go first.
Swallow, I dare you.
We're stuck in a loop"
"You can say that again"
"We're stuck in a loop"
"You can say that again"

My mother thinks we're too wrapped up in each other.
What did the president say?
Well...our vacation has taken an interesting twist!
No, I said "right" to mean that you were correct when you said "left."

So, "Twister For Giraffes" is a non-starter, then?
Let's take dance lessons, you said.
It'll be a lot fun.

Maybe we should just embrace the simple joy of line dancing.
Maybe tornado chasing isn't for us.
Oh man, my toe itches.
We better stop necking. I see your parents coming.
I've burped, we can unwind now.
I said the other left.
Nah, this isn't how we did it last summer.
Who loves you, baby?
Twister! Great fun for the entire family!
Let´s brexit!
Last time I go birdwatching with you!
OK, that's knot funny.
We're bonding.

Not saying you're codependent... but maybe it's time we talked about boundaries?
I knew I shouldn't have gotten tangled up with you!
How did our relationship get so twisted!?
Ring around the Rosie gone awry
We need to work on our make out routine.
Now this might be a good time to stick your neck out.
Okay - you bat first.
We can't keep meeting like this.
Bert, I wish you’d stay on your side of the bed’
Boundaries!
Necking with you is great foreplay!!!
I'm really not sure, but if that's your ass I'm looking at, you're getting a little fat.
Great! Now I can’t reach the champagne.
It seemed like a good idea in "Lady and the Tramp."
Just pretend we’re hugging - I see Mom coming.
The lions installed a ceiling fan in their den and you just had to have one.
So typical. You’re always tying us into knots.
Honey, this is how we tie the wedding knot.
Don’t you think it’s about time we tied the knot?
I told you we shouldn't get entangled!
That was one helluva Make Out session 

(optional tag: - -Can you see any hickeys?)
That's how you do the Twist!
My sore throat just got  a whole lot worse
Don't neck too hard, I had to wear a turtleneck last month for a week!
Sadly, Beloved, I can't see you anymore!
I think we did it wrong.
You first. NobNo. You first
Did  you  get the fly?
I think we might have intimacy issues.
Is this what they call "necking?"
Okay.  Now we jump up and we FLY!
I am soon never dancing with you again!
I’ve always wanted to neck with you, Ms. Modigliani!
I truly hate the mambo.
My parents did tell me that any necking would result in serious consequences.
This is not the necking I’ve read about.
Time travel? Twister.
You apologies are no longer credible, you pervert.
Necking is more involved than I thought.
I thought this is what they meant when they said bonded for life
Thank you, dear. I've always wanted a necktie.
Mom was right. We're too young to neck.
It was your idea to neck.
When I said “let’s neck”, I had something else in mind
Are you sure this is how 'Spin the Bottle' is supposed to be played?
I said "internet" not "interneck."
Let's never do a threesome with a snake again
See? This is why I don't like PDA
I beg to differ. This is NOT a yoga position OR a Kama Sutra position. It's just a stupid position.
The definition of necking.
Ginger:  I told you Fred, it goes cheek to cheek, not this way !
Doris, I want to find myself.
Lefty loosie, Casanova!
I love you so much you make my head spin!
I didn't realize marriage would be this limiting.
On three, ready? Jump high! 1, 2,...
Let's twist again..........
I don't think neck wrestling is going to catch on.
We might need to be in a more open relationship.
Remember, our safe word is TIPPYTOE.
Frankly, I don't see the point.
Darling, our relationship is so twisted.
No, left,left,left, right?, no left.
Humans have no idea what necking is all about.
I said “breathe” not “braid”!
Have you noticed we have a tendency to get wrapped around the axle?
Which one am I?
Cute, yes, but we'll go extinct.
It's going to be a long day.
See, Gerry...this is what happens when hugs invade someone's personal space.
You can lead next time.
I tried to warn you about pretzels, but Nooooo.
I told you that entanglement is only for subatomic particles.
I never realized until now that you were half python.
I don't think this is the way Chubby Checker did the Twist.
They're necks of kin
I overheard a tourist say neck ties are fancy but I don't see it."
Are you sure Chubby Checker said to is how to do the twist?
Left! No, Right! Not that way—your other left! You dummy, we’ll never spot any leopards if you can’t follow directions!
Why didn’t ask for directions? Where are we?
Who is Chubby Checkers anyway?
Time to unwind after a long day!
Now counterclockwise. Five, six, seven, eight....
Don’t you think this ‘fear of heights’ thing is getting ridiculous?
Would you give us a minute
This happens after every time we have curly spaghetti fro dinner.
I think we just need to buy a new Twister.
This isn’t the kind of necking I had in mind.....
Let's try petting.
Now we can go on tour as the Twisted Sisters.
Are you sure this new game Twister is played like this?
You kept weaving when I kept saying bob!
I told you there was something wrong with that new hair curler.
Conscious uncoupling, you say?
Do you think we're too old for Connect the Dots?
Is this a hug?
Hey, they’re neck in neck.
I don't know where you start and I end.
I liked the old sex.
Going my way?" - Rick Cohe
Let's twist again like you did last summer.
Clear my way.
This isn’t like what I saw on Pornhub
Mom's gonna kill me.
There must be a page missing in our sex education manual.
Now you've got both our neckers in a twist!
I told you that we should just be friends and not get tied up together.
Best first date ever!
You'll be hearing from my insurance company."
Does your neck still itch?
No, I said counterclockwise.
They just improved our protected status, and now this!
What do you mean you want a divorce?
Now, where were we?
I really don't think this is part of intelligent design.
Enough with the necking.  Let's go to my place.
Let's not watch any more roller derby.
Where again did you hear about this thing called necking?
And now, a reverse do-si-do.
No, YOU untwist first.
Hope you're not counting on getting that merit badge.
No one can see us now!
I forgot the safe word!
I said to go LEFT, Karl...
Sorry, Geoff. Couples yoga isn't for me.
my mother told us not to tie the knot!
Let's just stick with the two-step.
It's called 'stress'. Now we unwind.
Are you sure it was “one head is better than two”?
Let’s talk about boundaries.
I don't think that this is how the Tango works.
Why? It must be in our DNA.
No. I said, 'Look at that jaguar circling counter-clockwise.'
It's a good thing we're not zebras; people would be showing up to get their hair cut.
I said don't move while I'm trying to fix your earring, Karen
Topiary? I thought you said you were Toby.
Tomorrow night, it's my turn to be little spoon.
I just have this gut feeling that we can avoid surgery here
No, I said I wanted to EAT a pretzel
OK...yodel!
Let's not knot.
Now THIS is a meet-cute.
We're SO twisted.
This is what separates us from the zebras.
Now how are we supposed to shout?
I told you to swing to the right!
Spiraling love leads to entanglement disaster
Something tells me we are doing this necking thing incorrectly
We really need to relax and unwind.”
No, I don't think this is what necking is
That's the last time we share a straw!
From your neck to Darwin's ears.
i don't think we're quantum enough to get this entangled.
No, I'm taller.
Are you sure this is how to do the tango?
I like you, but not this much!
I think this is from the short neck Kama Sutra.
Maybe we shouldn't have played twister.
So, you're saying that the male who can undo this Giraffian knot is smart enough to mate with us?
This is quite a spotty situation!
Did you see which way the herd went?
Are we doing it right?
Wrap our necks in Velcro, you said. The leaves will stick to them, you said.
Look, Ma! We're Siamese twins!
It's not what you think.
There's a good reason for no necking on a first date!"
Wouldn't reciprocating rings be a little more practical?
Since I’m religious, this is as knotty as we can get for now.
No-o-o...close is good.
Do you  now understand the structure of DNA double-helix?
Where did you go ?
See, this is why I like sleeping alone.
This is definitely not how babies are made.
Maybe we should sync our GPS.
I'm going to need a good deep tissue massage from some baboons after this.
I swear, this is the last time I'm doing a team-building event.
The champagne! We forgot the champagne!
That's the last time I give you directions!
We are sooo gulletable.
My wife doesn't understand why I like necking.
Trust me. I learned this from the zebras.
Forgot to tell you I'm a Vegan.
The Necromancers
You look right, I’ll look left, you look left, I’ll look right , etc. etc.
I'm afraid we may not have children this way
Last time I stick my neck out for you.
I think we need some time apart.
OF COURSE we'll be spotted...
Sorry. I'm a close-talker.
T think we should try an open relationship
I’m sorry, this twisted love affair of ours has to end.
I love you, too, honey.
We need Dr. Phil to tell us how to get out of this twisted relationship
Look, we're both guilty of twisting each other's words around.
Bob, this affair is just getting more twisted every day.
With all their bragging humans can never neck as we do.
This necking business is gonna take a little more practice.
Kundalin
I don’t know how elephants deal with it.
Have you seen my glasses?  I'm in a spin without them.
Not nearly as romantic as it looks, right?!?
This necking thing doesn’t do a thing for me. What about you?
This is just self-defeating behavior. It doesn’t mean we’re codependent.
You’re the one who wanted to try ballroom dance
I hate those vultures!
Unprotected sex might be safer than necking.
Is that a hickey?
Sometimes you just get so wrapped up on the importance of birth order
I told you I couldn't learn the secret handshake!
If we're going as a caduceus, we have to face each other!
I am not sure that going to the costume party as the double helix is a good idea.
Wait, tell me again. Do you mean to your left or to my left?
Is this your first time necking?
Hate to break it to you, Eddie, but this is never going to fool Noah.
I told you I have violent dreams
Boy that was some wind today!
So maybe ‘necking’  means something else?
I think it's time to take this relationship to the next level.
I imagined our entwined lives differently.
Next time, just a quick peck on the cheek
Are we necking now?
When you asked about necking, this isn’t what I had in mind.
I am not sure chubby checker's twist works that way
When you said you wanted to go necking, I had something else in mind.
You are one bad kisser
This isn’t what I intended when I asked for a necklace.”
This isn't what I meant when I suggested a little playful necking!
I did ask for neck tie.
I think we should try a different conditioner.
I say we leave the medical symbol to the snakes.
Here she comes again.
Long necks are in our DNA.
I'm assuming this isn't in the Kama Sutra.
Okay now they can't sneak up on us, but how are we going to run away?
This is probably why the yoga instructor told us to spread out.
Hurry...my parents will FREAK if they catch us necking!
I don't think anyone will believe we're a two-headed giraffe.
I am sorry. He is new to the documentary business.
This is twisted!
I thought French Kissing was supposed to be fun.
You must stop downloading those porn flicks.
Do you think this will become as popular as goat yoga?
Sorry, Bette, but I'm just not ready to tie the knot.
Though long on enthusiasm, it was obvious that neither of the young lovers had any necking experience.
I'm not that fond of necking.
Are you sure this is the best way to dry off?
Wait for it!.....
Twister isn't as much fun as I thought.
Next time let’s just twerk.
Is that my butt or is that yours?
Me  love you looong time!
We really should stop meeting like this.
What fresh hell is this?!
So THIS is what they call necking!
Wait, who brought the selfie stick?
Long time no see!
A promise ring would have been easier.
When you said we should goes as DNA for Halloween this is what I had in mind Karl
Maybe we shouldn't try necking anymore.
We have to stop necking!
Necking is so awkward for us, Stanley!
Because it's in our DNA, that's why.
What am I looking at?
Maybe Twister was a bad idea on a first date.
O.K., Good foreplay, but now what?
You are such a pain in the neck!
I guess that WAS Chubby Checker driving around us.
Let's face it we can't lead up with a faux kiss!
How come you cannot dance? What continent are you from anyway?
Maybe if we get her to run circles in the other direction?
You're the one who wanted a Jewish wedding...
Agreed... straight line micro-bursts are rare on the Serengeti.
And you were nervous our date would leave you tongue tied...
This extreme hugging is getting out of hand
Now right foot yellow.
31 and me.
From now on, no foreplay. Necking goes nowhere.
This is getting a little too kinky for me.
My mother warned me about necking.
We’re corkscrewed
Why knot?
Are you sure this is the only way we can make babies?
Let's try kissing with our eyes opened, the next time..........
It was good for me. Was it good for you?
I told you, we were too old to play Twister, didn’t I
Stop, I’m getting dizzy!
Based on our clockwise necking, we are either in the Northern Hemisphere or Hopelessly In Love, Coriolis Effect be damned!
Hon, let's not find out what it means to move at breakneck speed.
Righty, tighty - lefty, loosey.
when molecular biologists and zoologists play charades...
Promise me we’ll never get high at a party again, and play Twister.
I thought you said you knew how to salsa!
What?  You haven't ever seen identical twin giraffes?
Now this is what I call necking!
MADE YOU LOOK,MADE YOU LOOK MADE YOU LOOK !!
Where is Chubby Checker when you really need him?
No more stargazing.
You Really Have a  Hold on Me!
Chubby Checker eat your heart out.
Wow! This new diet is really slimming me down- wait, no, that's you... I think.
Great for bonding, but not desert adaptive.
What do you mean “ stop rubbernecking”?
Oh, wonderful! How in hell are we supposed to drink water now?
Alright I promise not to leave you.
No no no, I said you go left and I go right!
We are in a bit of a twist.
In a twist"
I can't breathe Chad!
Keep looking around
my mother told me necking will lead us to the road to ruin
Skip the Twist.  Let’s Tango for courtships.
I knew we shouldn't have signed up for the 8-legged race"
This relationship has become entirely too twisted, Bob.
SGAFU!
I have separation anxiety
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
Thanks, but I'm not Russ.
It’s a wrap!
As I see it, this will be our close on the "Anyone Can Dance" show.
Now we know why vultures circle overhead.  Also, we're doomed.
You go first. No, you go first. No, I'll go first. No, I'll go first. No, you go first.
If this is your idea of screwing, forgetaboutit!
I don't know, Gina, but Position #10 is just not working for me.
Necking is OK, but nothing else.
No you hang up first.
I don't care what the zoologists say. We've GOT to have more than seven bones in each of our necks.
Watson, do you feel a Crick in your neck, too?
In 2019,
even necking is twisted.
No, Lorraine, I can't reach my cigarettes either.
I have nothing to say to you!
Look, just because you saw a picture about genetics doesn’t mean this is how you make babies.
These Samba lessons don't seem to be working for us.
That's the last time we go to Arthur Murray's together!
This would be very romantic if that Cartoonist would hand us our champaign... instead of sitting there like a dumb-ass.
See you around!
I've been staring at it for hours. I can't make it funny. I am now frustrated and tired. Thank you Victoria Roberts.
I'm sure we'll find a lesson in here somewhere.
Hey Humans!  Haven't you seen a couple necking before?
Gerry, this is why they say giraffes can't dance.
Twister...is not for giraffes.
Let's try the Hokey-Pokey with our legs instead.
Can you tell I love you?
Well if this is necking we should go back to kisses.
'My mother always told me to be careful about necking.'
I assumed we’d be really good at ‘necking’.
I said turn COUNTER-clockwise!
Do you have your GPS?
I told you necking could have consequences.
Okay, I admit our relationship has become somewhat twisted.
The okapi's never seem to have this problem.
I'm at my necks' end with you
Now you know why I am not much of a hugger.
You do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around.
It's called the pretzel hug.
I believe this would qualify as codependence.
What if we tried twisting some more?
Round and around and up and down we go" -- what is it you don't understand about that
After all these years, 
we still don’t see eye to eye.
At least we didn't lock our braces again.
It's a question of consent, Tyler!
OK, now get the champagne
okay....this time you go to the right, and i'll go to the left
You really need to subscribe a different adult magazine.
Come on baby. Twist and shout!
No, I asked you if you wanted to Tango.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT 'NO' YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?
Is it "righty-tighty"?
Over there. Where? There. Where? There. Where? There. Where?
Very nice of you to indulge my inner boa.
I think we’re stuck at foreplay.
Are you sure that this is how we do-si-do?
So this is what, ‘Netflix and chill’ means?
Why do we need pigtails?
Ok, now take a step and shout.
WOW! So this is how you do the twist.
Rewind the video so we can see this part again.  I'm not sure we've done this right.
I'm all for romance....but this "necking" thing just doesn't do it for me!
Why this? I think it's just in our DNA
Wow!  I've never been to a chiropractor before.
We should never have listened to that god damned Chubby Checker!
Maybe we should have started with Downward Dog.
I wanted to be the little spoon!
I hate it when the wind picks up like that
This isn't helping my digestion, either
Ooh! I found my missing sock!
You know I’m beginning to doubt this whole ‘survival of the fittest’ thing.
YOU NEVER ASKED PERMISSION!
I'm not sure that two heads really are better than one.
I love you too, but I can't handle another copyright suit from the AMA.
On the count of three, my right your left.
Wait a minute, which one is me?
I think we are doing these dance steps wrong...well they do, call it the twist
O.K. So I’m dating Thelma . You don’t have to get so bent out of shape over it .
Where’s my watch ?
Maybe we should rethink the 'highest leaf' ' bet...
Are you sure you've necked before?
Let's just stick with bear hugs.
Could this be love?
You sure this is going to fix my back problems?
I knew our race would be neck and neck
I love necking with you, Honey!
Could we just swat him next time?
Now What?
I think you're supposed to do-si-do your whole body.
This is not like we did last summer.
So do you suppose this is what he meant when he said we shared the same DNA?
I hate it whenever you get python-envy.
let's try that again
No more Red Bulls for you!
Another necktie?
OK. This time let's try YOU go to the right and I'LL go to the left.
Evolution didn't see this coming
Do they spell ‘love’ now?
Wait a minute!  You’re a lefty?!
I’m not sure this double helix position is going to work
This kinky sex has got to stop, but let's do it again.
I was thinking just 'one' kiss
Is that really what my ass looks like?!
Let's call it quits. In a neck and neck situation no one gets the upper neck.
These new zoo attractions are getting really weird...
Looks like we'll be neck and neck in our race to the hills.
Go to third! Go to third!
I thought you said there wasn't a safari coming today?
Well, this is certainly a new twist on necking.
We're so connected, it hurts.
Thank goodness we didn't enter the sack race!
One more twist and your shins are history.
I don't get what they see in doing the twist.
Is this what Chubby Checker really meant?
From the top, and this time a little less do-si and a bit more -do.
'well, we can scratch off 'chasing tornadoes' off your bucket list'
What part of  "on your left"  didn't you understand?
Number one, our spouses might not even notice.
Is this what you had in mind when you said we need to reconnect?
Fine. So you can walk circles around me. Now, what?
Damn it! Turn to MY left. MY LEFT!
In my own twisted way, I love you.
Next time you dip and I lead.
I knew first kisses could be awkward, but ...
It looked easier in the sex manual.
No more tether ball
In the competition to redesign the "bear hug," Marla and Roger were neck and neck.
Stop squeezing.  We are not reticulated giraffes, and we should not pretend to be reticulated pythons.
Call it whatever you want but I’m pretty sure the correct term is girgaffe.
Which end do we use to unwind?
I told you to go right, Henrietta.  Go right!
No,YOU turn left.
twill always be en'twine
How these humans can have sex after necking, I never know.
I told you,"Square Dancing is dangerous."
But I can't shout when my neck is twisted!
I'll see you around.
Is this really how boa constrictors get their food?
We've got to stop meeting this way.
No more dancing around the Maypole!
You really think they'll believe we're just one giraffe.
This couple’s yoga is not as fun as it looks.
I told you. You need to use Waze
Actually, maybe we should rethink tying the knot.
I normally go for the traditional two-twist greeting
Now I think we're supposed to shout...
This is how you do the “Hokey Pokey?”
I think we nailed our impersonation of a twisty straw
It feels as though this relationship is just too much of a stretch.
The Joy of Necks.
I just don't understand what humans see in necking....
Forget the braid
This is your idea of wooing me?
What no Champaign glass?
Are you sure this is what humans mean by "doing the twist"?
You go counter-clockwise and I'll stay still.
A bow tie would have been a better choice
I'm starting to think finding lingerie in your size would have been easier.
Breaking up will be hard on both of us
I guess you could say we are definitely a couple now !
I said I wanted a necktie, not to tie necks.
I told you my neck is longer..
Let’s think about this.
I’ve heard this is why people are buying cordless giraffes.
I love an animal themed necktie.
Those ‘couples yoga’ posts on Instagram make it look so easy.
You have really become a pain in the neck.
This is good, Jeff. Now let's add our tails.
I'm done sticking my neck out for you.
I always said you were twisted!
And I love you too. But couldn't you be the one walking backwards sometimes?
Now all we have to do is shout!
This was knot what I had in mind when you said you wanted to get together.
Look, if we figured out how to avoid being eaten on the ark, surely we can sort this out.
My therapist thinks we need better boundaries.
This is not what I meant by ‘serious necking’
I don’t understand why the teenagers are so into this necking thing.
Which way did you say she went?
Victoria, it's called a French Twist.
Are you sure we didn't catch it?
I thought you were going in for a hug.
Oh, they'll have a field day with "giraffe gaffe."
Wonder what Darwin would make of this one?
It’s too bad thumb wrestling isn’t an option.
It might be poor timing on my part, but I think I need a little more space.
Giraffic Park -- it's a swell place to neck.
Is this what's called "tying the knot"?
Look,a Spotted Double Helix
Sure, we're just 2 giraffes - But with a twist!
So Baby, how do we do the 'un-twist'?
Oh, wow, I didn't know I had a tail!
Maude, we’ve just made a major breakthrough in genetic research.
Elementary, my dear Crick and Watson
Now shout!
Twisters in the savanna - just another outcome of global warming.
Our relationship is counterclockwise intuitive.
I hear neckties are in this season." 
"Oh shut up Harold.
I always enjoy a patterned necktie.
Can you reach the champagne flutes?
And we're doing this because...
RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY! RIGHTY-TIGHTY LEFTY-LOOSEY!!!
Do you sometimes wonder if this bonding ritual hasn't gotten out of hand?
I enjoyed the dance lessons until "the Twist!
Now people will KNOW we have the exact same DNA!
And this is the DOUBLE helix...
I don't think this is how we are meant to replicate.
I guess we've gone beyond petting to necking.
At times, I feel like you’re strangling me to death.
Hold me tight.
Twister is not a good game for us!
Are you sure this safari was "neck-tie & tails?"
The tango may just not be your thing.
Now then, one more twist and your spinal adjustment will be complete.
You always overdo the hugging to avoid the kissing.
I don't know why you always have to twist everything I say!
I love the T-W-A-N-G when we unwind!
Necking isn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
This is the last time we go on the tilt-a-whirl together.
In this race  babe , we’re neck and neck
I didn't think we would end up like this.
I don’t even like ping pong matches, anyway.
I'm not sure the chiropractor would approve
We’re reporting live from our mobile unit on the plains of Angola.
We should go now.
I see animal print wraps are back this Fall.
Ew! Who farted?
You animal! This is what I get for tying the knot with you.
Mama loves mambo, not samba.
For the neck-shake: on three, you turn right, i turn left YO!
By  close, I  meant reasonably.
We just don’t see eye-to-eye on anything anymore.
Wait. My right, or your right?
I said “Tango!” Not “Tangle!”
This is giving me a crick in the neck, Watson.
Neck and neck...a new twist?
This is not what I had in mind when I said I wanted a hug.
What comes after righty tighty...?
I thought necking would be more intimate.
These selfies are a pain in our necks but think of the followers we'll get!
I guess we forgot how we did the Twist last summer
I'm not sure about this whole necking thing.
You gotta trust me, Jeff.
I'm telling you -- This is how genetic instructions for the development,functioning,growth and reproduction of all known organisms are coded.
Thank you, thank you! For our next trick, we're going to try to unwind.
Commendable effort, but mating for life is just not something we do.
Darn rotaries!
I wanted to go our separate ways.
Gotcha.  I didn't say go.
I knew there’re had to be a reason why we giraffes aren’t supposed to be necking!
You are twisting my words!
If you ask me, necking is overrated.
They call it the Hokey-Pokey.... all the cool giraffes are doing it.
There’s a guy over there with a phone. He’s making a video of us!
No, the French kiss left cheek-right cheek-left cheek, not left-left-left.
I warned you, don't watch Fats Domino on Youtube!
Wanna keep on necking?
Sure I enjoy necking, but...
That's the last time we play the game Twister."
I'm telling you it's just like checkers! No one ever wins!
Can Darwin explaine the phase we have got ourselves in?
No Cyril, you're facing east.
It's a love, hate relationship.
OK, but I'm still a better thumb wrestler.
Have you finished painting your caduceus yet?
Dang! I thought you said "right foot purple". Next time we're just playing charades.
and they think they know how to neck
Are you sure, Sweetie, that this necking?
I'm suing for whiplash
Do you allude to me as an "entanglement''?
We can't neck this way."
I’m not getting wrapped up in your crap anymore, Derrick!
Did I just give you a hickey?
No, you started it.
This is what happens when you try to lead.
Wanna neck?
This is why I thought we should keep our separate checking accounts.
Talk about a knot in your neck
Is that enough foreplay? "
Maybe yoga’s not our thing.
I'm not great with rejection.
Gad, I hate being dyslexic!
There is no such thing as safe-necking!
Hey, look: behind your ear!
Are you sure this is how we divine for water?
I didn't plan this far ahead.
When necking gets complicated

Wasn't the airshow a great idea?
Is this what is called "necking"?
OK, the untwisting can be tricky! You go first!
I'm a bit tangled up right now, but I can talk to you later.
Watson I have a crick in my neck.
I don't think this is the way you're supposed to play Twister.
I haven't been able to find a scarf I really love, until now."
You told me you were a Boy Scout.
When you said you wanted a committed relationship, I didn’t fully grasp what you meant.
I told you this was where necking could lead us.
loving you is a pain in the neck
are you sure this is how to do the Heimlich maneuver?
I know we agreed to hug it out, but this is ridiculous.
This time, let’s try you stay still and I go left.
Wanna quit necking and go to the next level?
‘“Are you sure you got the ‘hokey-pokey’ instructions right”
Bar Roberts, Washington, DC
Dear, I know you wanted try the "corkscrew position" in the Joy of Sex manual, but I don't think it was intended for giraffes.
For the last time, I said MY left.
If your neck weren't so long, this wouldn't keep happening.
I’m really wrapped up in you but this is ridiculous!!
Yes, I am glad we tied the knot.  But now we can't enjoy the benefits.
Enough with the Twist and Shout!
My right, YOUR LEFT!
After you, - no, please, you go - no, you... umm...so what do we do now?
I told you I didn’t dance flamenco.
This seems like a hell of a lot of trouble just for a selfie, Ralph.
When giraffes play The Hokey Pokey...
Isn't this better than an engagement ring?
That’s it. Stop screwing around.
Why can't you just give me some space?
It's your fault you twisted your way upon me
I know we're not bacteria, but what if horizontal gene transfer works out for us too?
I'm starting to think we should've gone to the climate rally
Nobody necks like we do, Baby!

I usually don’t do this on the first date.
If we died right now, what would they think?
Necking isn't all it's cracked up to be.
when I said we should spend more time around each other, this wasn't what I meant...
Next time, let the kid keep his popsicle.
Twister sucks.
My safe word is ankylosing-spondylitis
Twister for giraffes is really hard.
I cant figure out whether I love you, or love me.
No more tango lessons for me.
I’m not sure I get this necking thing.
I agree its therapeutic, but not in a genetic way
The priest warned me that necking would get me into trouble.
I don't see any trees with leaves!  Isn't that why we have tall necks?
I said don't get your panties in a twist!
Wait... this is crazy.
Let’s quit necking and start kissing.
Tell me again what this has to do with medicine?
kiss me you fool...ooops that's your neck
I don't want to get caught necking.
Let’s twist again like we did last summer
Round and around and around........
Missed. Again.
You have a big bug on your back.
So this is why mother is always telling us to keep our necks to ourselves.
What are you looking at. Somebody drew us like this.
Twist and Shout???
I'm ready to leave with no deal.
Yes, that really was fantastic. However, when we disengage one of us is going to fly off into the distance
I don’t think this is what they mean by necking.
Who's Chubby Checker?
Stick your neck out and that's what you get.
I feel so necked now.
Is this helping your heartburn?
I told you not to get it twisted.
That vulture wasn't interested in us
I enjoyed necking more when I was younger.
Righty tighty, dude!
We don't have enough bones in our necks for this to be possible.
I said turn left, left.
I don't think this is how you make a baby after all.
I think we took the mirror exercise too seriously.
I don't get all the excitement over this 'necking' thing

Did you forget the champagne?
Don’t worry! It’ll be over soon.
So, macrame fans, the reverse giraffes’ neck knot is that easy. Ready to try it at home?
I’m starting to think our marriage counselor’s couple bonding techniques are a bit too twisted for my taste, Sharon.
separation anxiety
Geoff, when I agreed to tie the knot this is not what I had in mind.
The mating ritual of the giraffe!
Really, you read this is how to save relationship.
Told you we shouldn't try the "Virginia reel!"
Sure, you know the Merengue.
They're gonna know we were necking again.
Gary, I know the event said formal wear... but this necktie is ridiculous
Tangled views attract each other
You sure this is how that dance works?
We think animation is preferable to live action for this scene.
Yo, bro!
Kiss does not sound like twist.
I can't twist a little closer.  When do we get to shout?
Perhaps we shouldn't tie the knot.
You sure this is Giraffe-A-Sutra?
I think we should get a room.
We've taken auto-asphyxiation to new heights.
This isn't what I meant when I asked you to give me neck.
It’s all in the DNA
DEFINITELY the same DNA.
WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH A PECK ON THE CHEEK!
I knew necking could be dangerous!
Dr.Suess, Dr. Ruth what’s the difference?
The wedding invite said formal attire- right?" 
"Yes, neck tie and all.
Is this camp?
Do you think we could go just one more round?
I always knew our lives would become entwined
I didn't see this in the Kama Sutra
Pull harder, I want my jawline lifted too!
Yikes!
I thought I told you, no necking on the first date!
Stop staring. You know it's impolite to rubberneck.
I think your separation anxiety got a bit out of control
Now who's necker chief?
We are star crossed - and crossed - and crossed - lovers.
I know I said we should tie the knot but this is ridiculous!!!
One of us doesn't have his head screwed on right.
I’ll never let go?
Why don’t we skip the dip and go back to a waltz.
Nothing like necking with you!
I wish I could love you more.
Not quite. You have listened to Chubby Checker, right?
I don't see what is so romantic about necking.
I will always always always love you
This all began with a Neck Roll.
I just wanted to give you a Hug and a kiss".
" Me too. Let's try it again so we can finish the twist with a kiss.
You and your Quantum Mechanics!
Forward March!
The therapist said we have a lot to untangle
I think we're done with foreplay, darling.
I think it's time we file for a trial separation.
God, I hate Kansas!
I got to that branch first."  "No, you did not. I was first.
No, going around again does NOT make it "child's pose."
We twisted the night away; now it’s time to eat a leaf.
See , together we can look even more ridiculous!
This always happens when I stick my neck out for you.
I guess we just weren't designed for fighting.
After a long day, I just want to unwind.
I think this will scare the snakes away.
Given our lingual dexterity, this kiss is going to be magnificent once you twist and stretch your neck just one more rotation. Come on. You can do it.
I don't understand why humans get off on necking.
No, you....... no YOU!! ....... Noah......you-ah !!!!
You've heard of Hulk Hogan right?
C'mon Watson lets share the Nobel price but don't tell Rosalind
My mother warned me not to 'neck' with boys!
Do you have a cough drop on you?
I agreed to neck but this feels more like third base!
Are you sure this is what humans call necking?
Hey, get a room!
Necking is supposed to be pleasurable?
My mother said you were needy.
And that's genetics in a nutshell.
We're too much alike for it to work.
We want to be Siamese giraffes!
Are you sure this is how you do "The Crossed Keys" position?
This isn't how I remember screwing!
Well, first, I'm not comfortable with the joint checking account.
This is why we don't eat snakes."
I think we should see other necks.
In the book,
Necking seemed so much more fun with Louise...
There's no way I'm telling that to the doctor!
Twister really does tie you up in knots!
I don't think we have quite have this "extended foreplay" thing down yet
I love you to death!
Your affection is suffocating.
Next time, just kiss me the normal way.
This wasn't what I had in mind when you said "want to neck"?
Let me be clear. I said I’ll go right.
Oh Sibyl talk about twists and turns in our relationship
I thought your Tinder profile said you knew how to neck
So much for hugging it out
I always thought that the Twist was just a dance
This necking has spiralled out of control
What's our costume for the party, again?
Boy, are we screwed!
We have gone about as far as we can go.
Will I never have a shoulder to cry on?
Just imagine that our spots are the nucleotides
'Let's compare tattoos,' you said.
The race was neck and neck.
We need a shave.
All these head games you play just keeps my mind spinning!
My mother told me not to neck at this age
Enough screwing around!
I don't think this is the way you do it.
We should’ve listened when they told us “No necking”!
I don't get it...  What's this fascination with 'necking'?
Just go with it. Getting the New Yorker takes commitment.
I feel kind of screwed with apartheid...
Whisper sweet somethings into each other's ear
This seems a little twisted.
Now,it's 1 and a 2 and a 1,2,3.
Umm...Is this what they mean by "enmeshed"?
Maybe"Partner Yoga for Giraffes" wasn't such a great idea.
I’m not sure this is actually the right  way to mix our DNA.
I said let's rap -- R-A-P!
Collaboration is overrated
Humans have no idea how much fun
"necking'" can be!
We were made for each other!
Now we’re really screwed.
this is another fine mess you got us into , OLLIE
I had the green light.
Which way is left?
I told you we shouldn’t try The Twist!
I like the way we did it before you learned that DNA was the building block of life.
The congestion has really picked up recently.
It's 2019! I didn't think necking lead to trouble anymore!
Let's try counterclockwise.
I guess this is why they say to never cross streams.
Who told you this is where babies come from ? .
Just breathe, Vic. I read all about couples yoga online.
Which way did you say?
Let’s not emulate TV bedroom scenes next time.
Okay, you were right; they went that-a-way!
To be honest, I don't find this hugging thing to be any comfortable, Linda.
Twist? I thought you said “tryst!”
He asked for a necktie for his birthday.
Here's looking at one of us, kid.
We really need to find a better way to hug...
So,....you're telling me that back in the 60's
there was a dance called the Peppermint Twist?
You there?
Yeah, I spotted you from miles away. What? You don't believe it!
This new "Dancing" thing- are you sure we've got it right?
Great! Our DNA is compatible.
Says one lion to another, "Why am I craving pretzels off of a sudden?"
I think we read the Twister game rules wrong.
I told you trying to catch a fly was a bad idea.
I don’t think this is what they mean when they say “necking”.
We got really wound up.
I don’t understand why mom said necking could lead to babies
‘‘Tis the season- Turn! Turn! Turn!
In the Fifties, necking wasn’t so complicated.
Did you say do-si-do to the left?
I can’t wrap my head around HOW this even happened
Call me Watson, 'cause there's a Crick in our necks!
This is another fine mess you got me into.
I have twisted feelings for you.
I told you square dancing was a bad idea.
You know we’re twins right
I think it’s ‘righty-tighty and lefty-loosey.’
I don’t normally neck on the first date.
Wouldn’t you agree this particular courtship ritual has a certain twisted logic?
You heard me wrong.  I said let's get naked.
I question whether mating like this will seriously improve our DNA.
I think our relationship is spiraling out of control, Bruce.
My mother always said this is what would happen if I stuck my neck our for a friend.
It's all about the DNA.
It's a game called Twister. Kids really like it
My mother told me necking could lead to something worse . . .
OK, bye.”
“You unwind first.”
“No, you first.
No, you said you were going to call the Guinness World Records judge."
When you told me your name, I was not expecting this, Ivy ...
This cannot be what necking is all about.
You’ve gotten a little too kinky, Jeff.
By George! We've invented the caduceus!
We should've won that game of charades.
How did they not get we were snakes?
Kinky is kooky.
You're killing me!
I  heard your sister was a little twisted but, she has nothing on you.
I told you we shouldn't try the Caduceus formation.
Next time, let's just play Twister.
Eff "necking!" Let's try French kissing.
Is this your idea of foreplay?
That’s what they call codependency
Are you close?
It doesn't feel like my chakra is aligned.
Well, I think Chubby Checker'd be proud!
I read about this in Vanity Fair.  They said to walk COUNTER-clockwise to disengage.  I think.  I'm like 99% positive.
I think this only works with fingers.
Oh honey, I love how we get to unwind at couples' yoga!
You're the one who said, 'Alexa, play Chubby Checkers'
Yes, I am all wrapped up in you too!
OK, so that’s the last time we play Twister.
Darling, we have to stop meeting like this.
Necking? You're choking me!
I don't think we should do couples yoga again.
Okay, on the count of three, jump!
Middle neck yellow is next.
Let's break the internet.
If you need anything, I’m at your neck and call.
I'm on the left.
Which way to the chapel again?
A prenup would have made things easier.
you thought doing the twist would  loosen us up.
So, are we 'neck and neck' or 'cheek by jowl'?
I've decided I prefer the French kiss to the French hug.
No, no, not counterclockwise you fresh thing..
Our A’s, C’s and G’s are identical, but only mom knows where our special T pattern marks us as different from each other.
no, no, no, i said your left, my right!
Do you have a Crick in your neck?"
"No, I think it's a Watson.
This is not what I meant when is said let's neck
But pray, which one of those is my body?
We need to unwind before going home
Love is double helix necking. Let's have a baby and name it Rosalind!
I get it; you’re into necking.
Don't worry. They can tell the difference by our spots.
That’s right, you didn’t get it twisted, he just called Biden old !
I don’t think this is how those ‘Learn about your DNA’ tests are supposed to work.
No, I said 'tongue twister'
Necking's no fun, and we don't have any clothes to take off...so, what do you want to do?
Which way did he say we turn?
Agreed. No more Twister.
Perhaps 'Twister' isn't the game for us.
It's a pain in the neck that you bought that Twister game.
Wait.  What's the use of necking if we can't kiss?"
Two households, both alike in dignity...
Playing Twister may have been a bad idea.
Nous sommes une tresse française!
I have a better idea, next time lets put colored circles on a mat, spin a spinner, then put our hooves on the correct color
It was your idea to hug it out.
Watson! You could have just DESCRIBED the double helix model you learned from Rosalind Franklin instead. 
Now my neck is my name, Crick.
This wasn’t what I had in mind when I said we should get closer.
I think I just swallowed the wrong way.
I hear do-dependence may not be such a good thing...
I think we've discovered a new kind of genetic molecule.
Is there a boa constrictor around your neck, too? Didn’t we stomp them all to death last year?
You gave me a Father’s Day necktie last year.
I told you to tilt your head to the left when we're necking
I don't think this is what they meant by necking.
Seems more like doing the twist.
Finally found the reason for our biology
I'll really be embarrassed if catches us necking.
Is this all there is?
Student biologists crossed giraffe and giraffe.
this is all your fault you fucking idiot
I love you so much I'm twisted into knots!
If anyone calls, just tell them that I'm tied up.
What do you mean I'm not kinky enough for you?
That’s the last time we play Twister at the Lyons.
One too many times again.
Oh, so that’s how our DNA looks like!
Honey...thanks for the neck tie.
This is why guys shouldn't play swords.
Oh! I wish someone had got this on gif.
What started out as simple necking ended up as twisted logic going nowhere!”
Hippity hoppity your neck is now my property
Next time let's skip the necking and just go for it.
Twist me to the end of love
Ass per Kamasutra, that's how snakes do it...
We should stop this! We are endangered!
Are you sure this is spooning?
I Dna. Your explanation of how we evolved liked this seems twisted.
Eagle Scout? I'm afraid not.
No I love Nascar. I just hate infield seats.
Maybe we won't be Siamese twins afterall.
That's the last time I'm going to ask you to check out my moles.
Bob, it's Summer and we're home. Surely you can do without the neck tie
Mother always was wary of entanglements.
No wonder you’re still a vergin
C'mon, one more twist!
LOVING IS EASY
One hug is enough,  already!
Yes, now I'm sure we've crossed the border
The therapist said to play Twister
You’re Choking Me.......!
Isn't it time we tied the knot?
May Day on the savannah.  If you love each other, you make it work.
We’re the original twisted sisters!
I love you too but I really have to go to work.
IF YOU CALL THIS NECKING, NOW WHAT?
I’d rather you knot.
I don’t think insurance covers whatever this is.
Correct...go LEFT!
Really...another necktie?"
Is this meant to be a hug Maurice?
No, I swear, my cousin gave me a copy of the Llama Sutra and said it works for giraffes too!
Yes Geoffrey, CODA, the 12 Step Program for co-dependency.Every Wednesday at 7:00 pm
Let's take tango lessons," she said. 
"It will be easy and fun," she promised
We love too much !
No.  I said it takes two to TANGO.
Perhaps going to the costume party as a caduceus wasn't the best plan.
I, Tightie Rightie, thake thee, Leftie Lucie...
There. Like we did last summer.
I don't think this neck tie fad will catch on.
When giraffes swipe right on the Savannah.
Right! Nevermind left! Nooo-o your right, And your left!!!!
I did say 'you need to get your head wrapped around this'! "
Chubby Checker is on to something,
but I still prefer the tango
Do you always have to twist everything I say?
You are a pain in my neck.
That's the last time we play Twister.
And they whirl and they twirl and they tango...floating like the heavens above...must be giraffe love.
How does this keep happening?
A little kink to our love life? 
It's not like we'll get all wrapped up in it.
Don’t worry. Trump says that what you see and feel isn’t real.
I enjoy necking, but this going too far!
I don't understand how we get so wrapped up in each other...
I think the right word is “enmeshed”.
This must be why my parents didn’t want me dating, let alone necking.
Didn’t I tell you playing Twister was a bad idea, Bob?
And don’t say “Let’s Twist Again”
It's "pass on the right."
No, my left Harold
Told you we shuda' just tried spooning.
Your twisted humor is giving me sore neck.
Today, we are learning about DNA.
I AM UP TO MY NECK IN LOVE WITH YOU...HERE IS HOPING THAT THE FEELING IS MUTUAL
I think we need to bring a chiropractor into our relationship.
This is the yoga pose for neck pain
Happy Birthday and I hope that you like the scarf.
I told you:  Lefty Loosy!
OK, OK, let's start over. We're not snakes!
So then we shout after the twist?
Love isn't blind.  It's just stupid.
We finally have peace and quiet, but still we can't unwind."
who said giraffes couldn't reach around?
I'm just not sure that our interests align.
For the last time, Steve, "clockwise" is the same south of the equator as north.
Your the best necker ever!
X-Rays, Hex-Rays. This is how I Enlightened Watson and Crick.
I did not mean that sort of tie up.
In Australia it counterclockwise.
Girl... you got me all twisted in your love!
This is why I’m not into speed dating.
Is this love or were you just leaning in the wrong direction?j
Dammit, Larry, I told you we shouldn't play Twister.
That's the last time we're going to a tennis match!
So what kind of relationship did you have in mind?
Well this is a fine fix you’ve got us into Ollie
When I said I was your prisoner of love, you didn't have to take it so literally.
You can't be a necromancer! I'm not dead!
Oh no, knot again!
It's just a twist of fate.
Just another bend. You'll reach the itch."
I told you what comes from playing too much Chubby Checker.
Come on, come on, Baby, twist and shout!
Regret is such a wasteful emotion.
No, you let go first.
That way."  "No, That way."  "No.

I just realized we're both necked. Quick, put on some clothes!
Ok, I submit!  You're choke holds are indeed impressive, but i'm afraid the lions won't be as vulnerable.
Joined at the hip isn’t this stifling
Is that my body or yours?
I don't think this "keep your enemies closer" technique will work in a real world setting.
This gives necking a whole new twist.
Which direction did junior go?
I told you I could wrap my head around it
Not what I had in mind when I said "let's neck"
Is it vice versa or versa vice?  I always forget which way it goes.

It seems we've gotten a bit twisted up.
It's called  ultimate necking.
Necking to the extreme.
We are nailing this choreo
This is going to be a hard one to explain to my wife.
We haven't been able to make things work for a while. Maybe it's time to consider a conscious uncoupling.
I'm not drunk, you're drunk.
For the third time, I said turn right!
Well, I think I need some space for myself
Was that a right or a left turn?
I told you that our love-hate relationship might​ leave us badly intertwined.
But, on the bright side, we won't be able to eat each other.
For Heaven's sake, get yourself an acacia tree house"
Screw you too!!!!!
I thought they said, “Don’t get your knickers in a knot.”
No, no, dear. It's one two cha-cha-cha. Not one two three go!
I should have listened when my mom sat me down for the "Talk".
I'm hooked on you babe!

This tango stuff is weird!
Love giraffes
This yoga move was your idea, now we're stuck
This is not my definition of safe sex.
It's a living!

I don’t know why everyone thinks we have a twisted relationship.
I don’t see how Vegas will like us.

Bad breath is grounds for divorce!
Can’t we just do it?
For your birthday, I thought i’d give you a neck tie!
We need to trademark this.
Coming to agreement on where to go to dinner is spotty at best.
Maybe dancing to Chubby Checker’s “Twist”wasn’t such a great idea...
Our chiropractor is going to have a field day!
Never, ever, serve boa for dinner again!
This is what happens when you're two-faced...
Let's just settle on a hickey
Hey, are we necking?
This is why we shouldn't hunt birds.
Babe, I think this necking thing is not for us.
Are you sure this therapy will work?
Was necking this complicated when we first met?
It's ALL YOUR Fault ... For Trying To Dance In Circles !!
I told you it was Greta.
Look over there, no over there, no over there, ah forget it.

Your tangled web does not deceive. I know exactly what you're up to.
Are you sure you know how to tie a necktie?
My last boyfriend was an aardvark. I accidentally suffocated him doing this. Poor dead Jimmy. His funeral was lightly attended. Burp! I'm Debbie!

Sorry, kid, but this is the corporate ladder.
Stop calling me 'Dad', you're embarrassing me in front of my friends.
Now that recreational pot is legal, you'll be seeing a lot more of us.
'Two more times, Dad, then we need to pick up Mom at ballet class."
I’m 45 and A HALF.
Shouldn't you be somewhere staring at a screen?
You work here at Google too?
It's new for us. We're actually from a swing state.
Wow, Bring Your Parents To School Day is so much more fun than taking you to work
Our Boss told us to work on our slide presentation
Well the judge said we could take a short recess.
Trust me, kid. Teachers need this more than you do.
Our parents never picked us up.
Can you spell social security?
When you're a grown-up, you view it more as a slippery slope.

You pay taxes for this park, kid? I didn't think so.
I don’t care what your mother said, I’m not ready to go home yet.

If you think this is unfair, just wait until you find out what we did to the environment.
This is how we celebrate getting fired at the White House.
DAD, PLE ASE  !! I gotta pee.
It's going to be like this for the rest of his presidency, son.
Normally we're swingers
The strenuous climb to the top then in an instant you're back at the bottom. It's a metaphor for life kid; you're next.
Don't complain. I've been waiting my turn for 30 years.
There's no app.  It's called a slide.
Sorry, I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
The corporate slide is a lot easier than the corporate ladder.
Little Timmy soon regretted adding his Ritalin to the teachers coffees.
Because the mood swings are taken.
Thank you for waiting—you are now number 3 in the queue.

We are having our pre school reunion!
When you come to the office next week, I'll let you fire someone.
Sorry, kid. We only have a few more weeks of Congressional recess.
Actually, instead of a pay raise, we got recess.
No, for you it's fun. For us it's just a metaphor.
No, you can't look up her skirt.  What if you want to be on the Supreme Court someday?
When you're eight it's goin' down the slide.  When you're an adult it's a corporate team building exercise.
Of course we're behaving like children, we're politicians.
We just finished paying off our student loans. Hooray!!!
Sorry, this section is for platinum playground points members only.
Look kid....after 18 months of Trump it was either this or jumping out the window

Oh yeah? Well, aren’t you a little young to be talking to strangers?
This one is for the kids that just paid off their student loans.
Inside every old person is a young person wondering what the hell happened.
There are good people on both slides.
When you're old enough to drink, you'll understand.
When you're an adult, it's called Team Building.
When you can show me a master's degree, a mortgage, and a dream deferred, then you can have your turn on the big slide.

Teachers are people too Jimmy.
After this we're going after the swing voters.
Sorry, this is the inner child area.
You're not the boss of me.
It's a Business Park, son. No tie, no slide."
One day you'll miss sliding down a slippery slope without unintended consequences.

Can't you play on your phone like the other kids
But the other kids are letting their parents go down the slide one more time!

We already spent your retirement. So now we thought we'd take away your childhood too.
The boss asked for a slide show.
Sorry, Kid, but forty is the new ten.

Son, you're too young for the corporate ladder.
OK, Dad, but this is the LAST TIME! Then we REALLY HAVE TO GO!!
Have you ever heard of a slide rule? Well, here's the rule.  This is our slide!

Your mom says this as far as I can go with my mid life crisis.
I see one tweet out of you and you're #grounded4ever.
Sorry- this is the after-40 downhill slide.
You're right, kid. These slides would work a lot better if the bottoms were elevated several inches off the ground. It's an easy fix but you will have to talk to the cartoonist about that.
Be careful, kid.  I got hooked on this when I was your age, and now I can't stop.
Tell your mother that the meeting is running a little late

I won’t tell your teacher if you don’t tell my boss.
Come back in twelve inches.
I don't have to stand in line -- I paid for this.

No, we were here first.
Just making sure it's safe.
Your Mom & I are seeing a new therapist.
After my slide, I got dibs on the sandbox.
Just one more, Son. It’s been a very stressful administration.
It’s only fair after ‘Bring your child to work’ day.
Sorry kid. It's another one of those Team Building exercises.

I'll be sure to remember the little guy when I make it to the top.
We only get half an hour for lunch, and the swings are full.
This is your "special" meeting for work, Dad?
I thought the corporate ladder was a metaphor when I was your age, too

Five more minutes, please, son.
Well? What did you think the teachers' lounge looked like?
Son, never pass up a free ride.
Just one more time I promise and then mommy and I will take you home.
Don't you have a screen to go stare at?
You get better at dealing with life's ups and downs as you get older.
But if my dad was still alive, he could beat up your dad.
Listen kid, we’ve waited all our lives to play.
It's called "Pay to Play". We paid, you didn't.

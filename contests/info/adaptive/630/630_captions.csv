Gore was right. This is inconvenient.
I clearly recall choosing hell over high water.
Looks like we might be facing a row vs wade  decision
Is your mom still in the lounge chair?
Still want to vote Republican, Ed?
Ok, but the moon landing was still a hoax.
On the bright side, at least we have a roof under our feet.
Please put your trunks on before the tide goes out!
Frankly, I didn’t believe the seafront would reach Iowa this quickly.
ON the water, Frank. I said a nice place ON the water.
It’s Florida. We stand our ground.
I'd be worried if we believed in climate change
And to think this was the best table at Mar-a-Lago Club just
5 years ago!
Never mind, I don't need to use the restroom anymore.
I’m just saying it might have been helpful to know that the travel agent is your ex-wife.
Thankfully, we've been assured this isn't happening.
Truth is, this is inconvenient.
I guess it wasn't fake news.
For all of this talk of global warming, the water is still pretty cold.
It's great to get away from the wildfires for a while.
Not to say I told you so...but I suggested we see the glaciers 10 years ago.
It's funny how an inch higher every year sneaks up on you.
Just think how bad it would be if global warming were real.
Let's go to Phoenix, you said. It's a dry heat, you said. That Al Gore's an idiot, you said.
Even if he didn't invent the internet, he got this right.
I am so glad the coalminers have their jobs back!
Well, at least no one can see your Speedo.
99 Scientists agree and I had to listen to 1 republican!
Do you feel like we’re drifting apart?
We voted for him because he said he'd drain the swamp. We didn't know he'd pump it right into our backyard.
How could this happen? Didn’t we vote against science?
Well, I suppose this is an inconvenient truth.
Fake tide. I'm certain of it.
Next summer, can we deny climate change in the mountains?
That better be your toes inching up my leg.
I blame the New York Times.
The brochure was right.....I have forgotten about my everyday cares!
When your brother told us his beachfront property was under water, I didn't think this was what he meant.
I will stop humming the theme to "Jaws" after you admit Al Gore was right!
Your penile shrinkage is the least of our problems.
You're right. It's nicer up here on the roof.
Okay, so maybe this doesn't prove global warming. Except that - WE'RE IN KANSAS!
Funny, the kids haven't said a thing in hours.
Before climate change, Omaha Beach meant France, not Nebraska.
It's still better than last year when you brought your mother.
Look over there honey, it's the president!!!  Can you ask him to toss us some paper towels?
Well, they were right about the ocean view.
I take it you bought the property at low tide?
I thought you said they’d drain the swamp.
Wow! The seat cushion really does work as a floatation device.
And  I suppose this is my fault too.
If they had called it "Coastal Devaluation" instead of "Climate Change", I'd have paid more attention
Is this global warming, the blue wave, or the deep state?
I still need proof.
I guess the Prius wasn't enough.
These tan lines will be very difficult to explain.
I'll say it's an inconvenient truth…
Man, the Chinese are going all out with this global warming hoax.
It’s true. Hands are very hard to draw.
Are you sure this is just a liberal hoax?
I'd love just one day without a metaphor about our marriage.
Well, that settles it -- a rising tide only lifts boats.
Funny. I was sure he'd have drained the swamp by now.
Remember when global warming was just a hoax?
Archimedes predicted this would happen if everyone went swimming at the same time.
Reconsidering your vote yet?"
Well, at least the coal miners still have their jobs.
You did say we were going to the beach 'come hell or high water'.
I guess I always thought this would be our grandchildren's problem.
We'll go when I'm done peeing.
Yeah, but at least America’s great again.
Charles, I’m ready to talk about selling the beach house now.
No, that's not my foot.
...not the type of ‘total immersion experience’ I meant.”
I think I forgot to turn the faucet off.
Is that an ark?
I've had it up to here Kevin.
This climate change hoax has gone too far.
Next year remember your swim trunks so we can sit on the beach.
Chris Christie is in the water again.
It's not true if we don't believe it.
I shaved my legs for this??
You used Apple Maps again, didn't you?
Look at the bright side. The beach is much closer to home now.
Don't be ridiculous.  The President says we're not wet.
The kids seem quiet.
You and your stupid Groupons.
You say, ‘high tide’, I say ‘global warming’ “
But what if this is low tide?
Covfefe.
I'm sure if the ice caps were really melting, the water wouldn't be this warm.
I assure you nobody is going to take our chairs if we go back to our room now
I still say it's half full.
I've had it up to here with climate change!
These awful liberal hoaxes get more realistic every year.
I don't think he's coming back with our drinks.
I watched the forecast on FOX.
remind me again how climate change is not settled science.
Well...now you know why second prize is 2 weeks.
But Fox news said it was a myth.
Should we wake up your mother?
Fire Island isn't what it used to be. You know, before the gays caused global warming.
Know what's inconvenient?  Gore smirking every time he skis by.
Very different from our last trip to Alaska, isn't it?
No, the wine should be okay. I'm not optimistic about the sandwiches.
Please put your trunks back on before low tide.
Still better than visiting your mother.
Alexa, when is low tide?
It's the only way to get this good spot when the tide's out.
Pity about the sandcastles and children.
Just keep repeating: "What you're seeing is not what's happening"
I've had it up to here.
I feel like we are drifting apart.
Did that guy just put an elephant on a boat?
Still beats vacationing with your mother-in-law.
Mar a Lago, 2025
Please tell me you're playing footsie.
Do you remember when Arizona did not have tides?
Of course it seems wet. That's what makes it a hoax.
Honey—how tall are the kids?
Are you peeing too?
Would you prefer 'I told you so' or 'Good choice, dear'"
Well, that happened faster than I expected.
I guess we can add the tide charts to our list of fake news.
Now that we’ve grabbed the best spot, all we have to do is wait for low tide.
What are we wading for?
I’m hoping for more ebb, less flow.
I think I'm going to start believing in science.
What part of the 'ice cap melting'  didn' t you understand?"
Please tell me that's the Gulf-stream and not you.
Think of it as half empty.
That’s the difference between you and me.  I prefer to see the tide as half full.
Just like our mortgage.
This is what it must feel like to work at the White House.
Well, an optimist would say the beach is half empty.
Still beats Buffalo.
We better leave before the tide comes in.
That is true, we do have the beach to ourselves...
You have to admit, when the Chinese do a hoax, they go all out.
Don’t stick the umbrella pole through the bottom of the boat, I say. But, Noooo, you say...
More research is needed.
Tell me that's your foot, George.
It would have to be much colder if it was melted polar icecaps, that's all I'm saying."
It has nothing to do with global warming. You're sitting on the drain.
It’s not the warming, it’s the humidity.
Climate skeptics in 2050 enjoying the West Virginia coast.
Okay fine - but they still can’t convince me that I’m related to a monkey.
The tides they are a-changin’.
Should we be concerned that this is low tide?
I still think we should do the glass bottom boat cactus tour.
Are we in de-nile?
how much further inland do you think we'll need to go next year?
Sure beats sitting in two feet of snow.
Say "time and tide waits for no man" one more time, and I''ll deck you.
Is that warm water you or the gulf stream?
We'll always have the Paris Agreement.
I liked Antarctica more when the penguins were still here."
I have an idea of what you can do with the umbrella
No, dear - it is simply the alternative fact that Drumpf has increased the volume of ocean water more than any other President in the history of our country.
Good thing you insisted on bringing the umbrella"
Okay, I'll grant you global warming. But I still don't see any Russian collusion.
To be fair, the vacation package did call it an "Immersive Experience".
So. We still going with 'climate change is a hoax' ?
You going in?
There's still no scientific consensus"
I told you if we lived here long enough we would have waterfront property.
Perhaps pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord was a bit premature.
There’s a new island of plastic in the Pacific, so it all balances out.
I'll fold the umbrella.  You find the kids.
The beaches are so much more peaceful since the glaciers melted.
It's only high tide.  I still don't believe in global warming.
So, is this the Mar or the Lago?
I didn't think it would be this inconvenient, did you?
2 DOWN: The fourth letter of the alphabet + a large river in Egypt
Great, now I've got crabs.
I think we're about to be in over our heads.
I think it’s time to sell.
Well, Antarctica is different than I expected.
Well, I still hate Al Gore.
Put on your shorts, dear. The tide is going out.
ENOUGH with your Climate Change nonsense! 
I've had it up to - well -  oh, FINE. Point taken.
Billy can swim, right?
See...you've got no reason to worry about how your ass looks in your swimsuit.
This doesn't feel like a hoax.
This is another one of your “I told you so” moments, isn’t it darling?
Totally wasted this morning shaving my legs
Alaska in December just isn't what it used to be.
On the other hand, we only need half as much sunscreen.
When did you say high tide was coming in?
Oh no — do you feel rain?
Just ignore it, it’s fake sea level rise.
Okay, I might be starting to regret voting for Trump.
The science isn't conclusive.
Harry, I told you this beachfront property would put us underwater!
You are most certainly not the prince of tides.
Quit complaining.  We can afford this beachfront property BECAUSE we invested in oil.
All we need now is for that guy to show up and throw us a roll of paper towels.
Maybe we could move back a little bit and call ourselves "climate change considerers?"
You go ahead, I’ll stay here and watch our stuff.
Oh great, the kids leave for college, and the ice caps melt.
It's so awful to think that climate change even affects the Hamptons.
Okay, you win.  They are melting.  But I still say the Earth is flat!
Its all about finding balance in life, and keeping your head above water.
I think the science is in
Well, I guess the truth IS inconvenient.
If you say "cry me a river" one more time, I am going to scream.
Not yet. I don’t want to lose our spot.
Lucas and April silently consider broaching the topic of global climate change for the first time.
Those coal stocks really paid off though
We're nearly drowning just so the cartoonist can disguise his signature.
Getting out of this timeshare will be nearly impossible.
...and I believed he was going to drain the swamp...
I think we’re drifting apart
I remember when Short Island was Long Island.
Buy a Florida beachfront," you said.
"It's so cheap, what could go wrong?"
you said
I think Scott Pruitt just floated by
I sure hope that's you playing footsie with  me.
(insert obvious global warming quip here)
I think I’m a liberal now!
You could at least recycle that can.
I thought we'd be dead before this happened.
It’s called high tide, Harold. Must you complain about every little thing?
The ad did  promise an immersive experience.
The GOP said sea levels aren't rising, land masses are sinking.
The scientists said we have fifty more years, but I think we have twenty minutes.
Next year I pick
It's only twice a day.
I still can't believe how fast that ark booked up, can you?
Global warming is such a hoax. It’s actually cooler at this beach than it was ten years ago.
We didn’t bring the kids, right?
Dear, where are the kids?
Should we cancel the nachos?
If you sing Old Man River one more time I'm going to stuff you in that beer can.
Siri, when is low tide?
I thought with the melting of the polar ice cap that the water would be colder!
Well, now I guess comes 'hell'"
Remember when we needed sunblock on our feet?
So the polar ice is melting,” you said. “So how is that going to affect us?” you’d said
You think this is fucked up? Steve Bannon is headlining the New Yorker Festival.
I have crabs.
It’s low tide. Wait for me here- I’ll get lunch.
Merry Christmas from Maine, from all of us at the E.P.A.
OK I give up; the tide IS coming in.  Are you happy now?
First it was the mortgage. Now it's us.
I thought 'literal time share . . . littoral time share' . . . what could be the difference?
I hope that’s you playing footsie.
This still beats our vacation to Afghanistan last summer
We should have brought a high chair for the baby.
The dude who created the internet was right....
Are you peeing? I'm peeing.
I think I just felt a cold, hard fact nibble on my toe.
It's just a normal climate cycle. It was like this in the Pleistocene, too.
We're in too deep,Larry.
Thanks to global warming we can finally afford oceanfront property.
I would've thought the kids would float.
Be patient.  In 6 hours,this spot will be great.
So when the agent said the house was under water, what did YOU think he meant?
Budge now and the Climatologists win.
We're gonna need a bigger vote.
So, is it still your favorite spot 30 years later?
So, here we are -- life imitating finances.
Honey,was it Trump Travel you said you booked with?
Climate change deniers on vacation.
Greenland's changed a lot since our last vacation.
Can’t be global warming... this water is cold...
Still in denial dear?
That must have been the big blue wave everyone’s talking about.
Next time I think you should tip the cabana boy.
It definitely feels wetter this year.
Chris Christie must have just gone in for another dip.
Just ignore it. Trump has assured us that climate change is a hoax.
Just don't give me the "It could be worse, it could rain" line, please.
This is my fault. I always confuse tsunami with tiramisu.
Thank goodness for Scott Pruitt. Ohio's beaches have never been better.
I suppose you still think Al Gore was pushing a left-wing agenda.
I’m going to suggest a mountain resort for our next coal industry executive retreat.
So now he says it meant "Make Antarctica Green Again"?
I’m giving some thought to buying a hybrid
So maybe Al Gore was right
Just because it isn't crowded doesn't make it a "hidden gem", Chris.
Looks like he lied about draining the swamp too.
Slowly but surely, John and Marsha came to the conclusion that global warming might just be real.
Are you still voting Republican?
Death Valley has sure changed since I was a kid.
Trust me, come low tide everyone will want these seats.
On the upside, it’s gotten rid of all those screaming children.
They said the property was feet from the beach, they never said which side.
Can you still see the kids?
But we're Republicans, there's no such thing as Climate Change.
I'm telling you, honey, climate change is fake news. Where's the evidence?
Is it 2050 already?
Far better than being on that ark with all those animals
Where's Grandma?
Isn't it a shame, dear, those nasty environmentalists were right...?
Don't panic. We're caught in a rising tide of conservatism.
It's not climate change. It's just so many immigrants in the water it's raising the sea level.
I've got a sinking feeling.
Are our assets underwater or do you have an umbrella policy?
I just never thought it would happen at Mar-a-Lago.
No, dahling, November is when the blue wave is coming. This must be the Red Tide.
global warming is a joke,dear.this water is freezing!
We’re republican, we don’t believe in global warming.
Should we go for a swim?
Global warming is a myth...
Global warming is a myth...
Global warming is a myth...
Why were they paging Sue Nami?
When Harvey Met Sandy.
Is that Al Gore floating in?
I thought sea-level rise was only for poor countries.
And who said Montana wouldn't ever have great beaches?
I’ll tell you what’s a hoax, Roger. This marriage.
Tide charts are for sissies.
Did you notice if that wave was red or blue?
He may not have invented the internet, but he sure was right about climate change.
I can cross Antarctica off my bucket list.
We did say 'come hell or high water' we'll enjoy our vacation...
Good thing global warming is a hoax or we'd really be in trouble.
Ocean water, it’s the new sand.
Is that the last beer?
Is this is what our agent meant by umbrella coverage?
I guess Oklahoma isn’t inland enough
It's almost as if the climate is changing...
Well, dear, maybe it’s time we admit there really is some truth to this climate change business.
I still say a bit of beachfront erosion and rising seas is a small price to pay for Trump's tax cut!
Fake water?
Where’s that guy with our drinks?
I wrote the Op-Ed.
So glad we pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement...
Well Bob, you said you would never believe in climate change come Hell or High Water....
You’re right. It’s just like the Hamptons. After Katrina.
I'm sure he'll be here soon with the paper towels.
Do you think our waiter is ever coming back?
Good call on the umbrella. I heard its going to rain.
The brochure did say we'd be captivated by the sea.
Is this a Blue Wave or the Red Tide?
Thanks, Captain Obvious.
What do you mean “global warming”? It’s so much cooler than last year.
Well, the realtor did promise ‘360-degree’ ocean views.
I think we should have invested in Noah's company.
When did we stop believing in science?
Ugh. We should have known something was up when the discount code was "CLIMATECHANGE."
Stupid butterfly.
We're making the best out of Climate Change.
We're Americans.
I am not a clam and I am not happy, dearest.
Such poor service. We sat down before the tide came in.
The nice thing about global warming: the beach comes to us!
Honey, have you seen the kids?
Aah, finally high tide. I’ve had to pee all day.
The Ice Caps looked better in the brochure.
Just be patient, when the tide goes out we will have the best spot on the beach.
So I suppose this is also the fault of my hairspray in the '80s, Hal?
What exactly did you think "high tide discount" meant?
Are you SURE it’s fake water?
This should be interesting when the tide comes in.
I guess our 'no politics this weekend' rule doesn't extend to elaborate metaphors.
Honey, I think my water broke.
We're leaving if my hair gets wet.
Thank goodness for the umbrella, I didn't feel a drop of rain"
... on the other hand, global warming allows us to pee without getting up.
By pretending this isn't happening, we are making America great again."
I still say it's a hoax.
I love Nebraska.
Well, so much for fake news.
So, remind me again.  Is losing our beach fake news, or a Chinese hoax?
Oh I do hope it doesn’t rain.
Well, its a very *effective* Chinese hoax
That was some iceberg.
Call me Ishmael.
Recalculating...
OK, Mr. Wait-until-we're-up-to-our-asses-in-alligators, now can we re-open the discussion about global warming?
Looks like this is the last summer we use the roof deck.
It's pronounced  'soo-nah-mee' ; the T is silent.
Those scientists will stop at nothing to fool us into believing they're right about global warming.
I'll be damned, you CAN see Russia from here.
Beats a forest fire.
Do you remember when the desert was dry and the beaches were wet?
Apparently it waits for no woman, either.
So, when you said, 'There's a blue wave coming,' I thought we were still talking about the mid-terms.
I told you buying beachfront property after Trump pulled us out of the Paris Climate Accord was a stupid idea, Frank.  But did you listen,?  Nooo....
A rising tide sinks all coasts
A rising tide doesn't lift you if you don't have a boat.
This ain't high tide, Stanley, it's high time you rued your Trump vote.
No, half full.
It’s just a theory
Technically, it IS a place in the Hamptons with an ocean view.
Don't worry.....when it's time to leave, I'll call a TUBER.
Nope. Not a hoax.
Fine! I was wrong, the tide is coming in. Are you happy now?
Please tell me that’s  your foot!
NOW can we buy a Prius?
The App said Running Water ... I should have read the fine print.
And to think. Gore and his climate change mafia predicted we’d be completely under water by now.
What’s wrong?  You’re the one who said you wanted a deeper relationship.
If you would just admit you were wrong about the tide, we could move our chairs back.
Now will you watch the Al Gore video?
I haven’t seen the kids in a while.
Like I always say, you’ve got to jiggle the handle.
I didn't really mean it when I said I wanted to go on vacation come hell or high water.
I bet you can' t give me one good example of global warming.
Well at least I can say that you got me wet on our honeymoon now Bob.
I guess the good news is that for once you’re not  in over your head.
I thought the North Pole would be colder.
But the realtor assured me it was a Chinese hoax.
I could swear you said "ON the water."
I guess it really doesn't matter that you wore dark socks to the beach.
Well at least it's not raining..
Hmmmm . . . That was quicker than they were predicting.
'...on the other hand, it's not crowded.'
Just one more lovely vacation day left before we get back to mining that clean coal.
You voted for him Mr. "No Global Warming".
Well, so much for Trump's theory
I thought it was just our mortgage that was underwater.
So we're sticking with 'hoax,' then?
That waiter's been gone a long time.
This is the high water mark of our vacation
This isn't the Miami Beach I remember.
So this is why we got the discount.
So Jack, do we still believe climate change is a liberal myth?
Don't.....say.......a......word......
Some hoax.
I’m up to here with your theories.
OMG …that poor couple who snatched the sun carts in front of us !!
Well, honey, technically it is ten feet from the shore.
The science isn't settled he says.
Frankly scallop, I don't give a clam.
All right, you win. I think we should move to another spot.
Stan, you promised that global warming wouldn't upset our vacation plans until 2030.
Low tide is just not what it used to be.
Do you want to talk about it?
On the plus side, dear, we now shave four hours off our trip to the beach."
We beat everyone else to this spot, and we aren't leaving.
OK. Go ahead and pee.
I don’t care if it’s a hoax – it’s ruining our vacation.
This is your local newscaster reporting on a couple of Trump supporters who have been waiting since early summer for the fake ocean rise to recede....
Apparently a rising tide doesn't float all boats.
I didn't think I could hold it until the tide came in.
I’m not moving until you admit I told you so.
Care to share your doubts about climate change Bob?
Waiting for Godot in the age of climate change.
Please tell me that was your foot brushing my leg....
I hope you brought rice for your phone.
This was always our spot and we won't let global warming change it.
Thank God we've got a roof deck.
They did say global warming would impact the next generation most of all. Hone, have you seen the kids?
I told you to vote Democrat.
Did we bring the children ?
What time does the tide come in?
Can you text Noah to pick us up around 6?
Climate Change Hoax Society members enjoying the natural fluctuation in water levels .
Because it's Florida. You're not allowed to say climate change.
When the tide goes out I want you to go with it."
Two dry Martini's
The water's not going to rise, you said.The water's not going to rise that fast, you said.We can move the beach chairs to the roof, you said. Oh, look, there are the Murphys clinging to their chimney."
Honey, why is he drawing us?
I just don't understand. We were the first people I know to buy a hybrid.
Remember when Houston was 50 miles from the coast?
I'm sorry.  I thought Greenland would be safe.
Mom and Dad.
Alaska, July 2042.
I still say tide tables are not proven science.
Seems like only yesterday they called global warming a hoax.
I dunno, honey.  Maybe we should have switched to those squiggly lightbulbs.
Well, I'm not moving until you apologize either.
Does this water feel glacial to you?
Are you _absolutely_ sure that global warming is a myth, dear?
I know global warming is just fake news, but it sure seems real....
What happens in Florida doesn't seem to stay in Florida.
Next time you ask for a table with an ocean view, you might want to tip the maitre de.
Should we tell the Fake News or the Real News about this?
I thought climate change was next year?
Oh really? Then why is the water suddenly warmer?
I’m not selling until we get our price.
I told you in 2018 that we shouldn't book this Miami hotel for 2020.
Don't worry dear, it's not an omen. I've had much worse honeymoons than this
Don't make waves, Dear.
By the way, we're up to our ears in credit card debt too.
Remember when we cared?
Reasonable people can disagree on the science.
That better have been just a warm current.
Glacier National Park has changed since I was a kid.
I'm not saying it again.  I rented this umbrella for the whole day and we're getting our money's worth!
In an hour, these will be prime beach seats.
Think of it as being immersed in the present.
Did you bring the shark repellant?
In six hours, 12 minutes and 30 seconds, this will be a prime location!
Did he say 40 days or 40 years?
So, Mr. Sit In The Same Place on the Beach Every Year, do you still think global warming is a Chinese hoax?
We are in big trouble Harry, it’s not even high tide.
Should we also address our marital complacency?
On the bright side, we’ll never have to water the garden again.
He did say there would be a Huge blue wave this year, who knew he meant water.
Aside from the occasional beer can, what exactly is it that a rising tide is supposed to lift?
Do you remember our first trip to Antarctica?
Even on vacation we're barely keeping our heads above water.
At least this way no one knows I'm a mermaid.
NEAR the water, I said NEAR the water . . .
Do you ever get that sinking feeling?
They should come with our order soon
If only you'd remembered your bathing suit.
No, you were definitely wearing trunks when you left the house.
I kinda miss the polar bears.
It's not how I remember from my childhood.
At least the fires have been contained
Guess what Honey. I don't have to get up to pee anymore.
At least we're not a shallow couple.
Maybe we need a new site for our Climate Change Deniers' conference.
How long was I asleep for?
At least the wildfires are out.
I suppose the Fake News will say this somehow proves the sea level is rising.
So, when did they say FEMA was gettin here?
O.K. - you were right, it was low tide.
Well, at least we don't need to buy Depends anymore.
You and I both know that global warming is a hoax, Murray, but apparently we neglected to tell the Atlantic.
Ok no one is looking.  See if you can find your bottoms.
You think somewhere in the North Pole there's two penguins sitting waist deep in sand?
I don't know how long I can go on being a global warming denier, dear.
Let me guess. You found this place on Kelp.
I figure another two years and our condo will be beachfront.
I always get waxing and waning mixed up.
Another year at the climate change denier summer home
I thought we voted for him because he said he was going to drain the swamp.
Hank and Dora find out for themselves what the climate change hysteria is all about.
Here comes the beer you ordered!
Cyclical, my ass.
I think we’re alone now.
Harold, obviously the tide chart you saw this morning on Fox was fake news.
The POTUS said no global warming.  You know he can't say that if it's not true.
Maybe Al Gore was right after all.
You see,dear.  The tide does change,even for Republicans.
Trust me, Nicholas, when the tide goes out, we are going to have the best spot on the beach.
And you said I wasn't using the word 'literally' right when I said that 'Our marriage is literally underwater.'
But I don't believe in climate change.
The government says it's 'nuisance flooding,' not sea-level rise.
I never said it was a hoax. I just said there was disagreement.
I didn't realize this is what the bank meant by our beach house was under water.
How about for our next vacation we avoid places that offer a “climate change discount”?
Well, what are we wading for?
My implants are the only thing keeping this marriage afloat.
First come, first surfed.
"I thought it was a typo"
On the plus side, no one can see that you are wearing a speedo.
Harold, that IS you playing footsie, isn't it?
Now I see why the Maldives vacation package was so cheap.
If climate change were real, why is this water so cold?
What was it you were saying about high tide being fake news?
The water may be higher, but at least it's warmer.
It's not the heat, it's the sea level.
So this  is "fake climate."
If the seafood isn’t fresh I’m going to say something.
On the bright side, flies aren't biting my ankles
I guess we’ll enjoy this vacation come hell AND high water.
I don't know about you, but I think this was a small price to pay for buying a big gas guzzling SUV.
It came in. It will go out.
I don’t care what your orange friend says Fred - this is about climate change.
30 years of marriage and this is the wettest you've ever made me
How far out there is our house?
I hate being in Al Gore's dreams.
Well, it saves on the long walk to the restroom.
At least there isn't a line to use the rest rooms.
You wear the Speedo - we sit out here.
Please tell me that's just you playing footsie.
It's not the heat - it's the humidity.
But we've been going to this same spot for years!
Something in the unparalleled view just bit my finger.
Now do you still believe he's making America great again?
They laughed when we bought oceanfront
property in Arizona.
Is that a Moray eel, or are you just happy to meet me?
This is apparently what the resort's brochure described as an "all-natural infinity pool."
Don't the tips of those letters spell out "Mar-a-Lago"?
Even here in Kansas it's getting harder to deny climate change.
So, how many glaciers are we down to now?
Climate Change. I didn’t see that coming!
You proposed to me on this very spot 35 years ago. That was so much CO2 ago.
Have you seen the children?
Should we move?
So how did your climate change deniers meeting go this morning?
I say blame it on fake news or Obama.
Is this hat too Hamptons?
Can't you admit you were wrong just this one time?
Can I see that brochure again?
That was inconvenient, Al.
I wish more people had listened to you, Al.
I think my water broke”
What did you say Playa de Baño meant?
It's a great sand castle honey, I just think the moat is a bit much.
Ralph, for the last time...Global Warming is not an opinion.
Miami Beach 2025
Frank, are you peeing again?
Shish! Not one word! We're Republicans! Global warming doesn't exist!
I think I just saw a polar bear.
Face it, Harry.  We're in hell AND hot water.
So let's see...'climate change is a hoax' and 'now is the time to buy waterfront property' . What more wisdom does your cousin have to offer?
Herb, would you be a darling and snag my Tab before it floats away?
Care to resume our debate on Global Warming today sweetheart?
Yeah, Denver was different in the old days but I still don't believe in climate change...
is this a good time to tell you I hate your mother?
Is that your hand?
Pretty sure I'm not as happy as a clam
Ok, you win. Next time we vote for the candidate who says it’s not a hoax.
Well, I'm glad the tide came in. I had to pee.
You know this is all Obama’s fault.
So, this Global Warming...still fake news?
What time does high tide roll in?
This doesn't mean that climate change is real.
Didn't he do a terrifc job, here in Pueryo Rico?!
Who would have thought Global Warming would give us beachfront property. Yeah but were in Arizona.
First our mortgage, now this?
I don't think we bought at the right time.
I appreciate your belief that this bay is not tidal, and have enjoyed your detailed reasoning as to the effects of global warming on inland waterways. May I now continue my earlier attempts to explain exactly what I mean by "manspaining?"
I submitted a caption to last week’s New Yorker cartoon caption contest but now that they’re giving Steve Bannon a platform, I want to withdraw it. I’ll also be canceling my subscription. Go fuck yourselves, Nazi sympathizers.
Steve Bannon is such an asshole.
Thanks to global warming, I can enjoy the beach even with my incontinence.
Don't be alarmed, dear. I am advised that the rise in sea levels is temporary, and we should have our beach back in 15-20,000 years.
I liked it better when we just had a water view.
Ok, so it's real. I still maintain we don't know how much is caused by human activity
No, the ocean is NOT rising; that's a democrat HOAX.
No, you said. I want to be closer to the water, you said.
GREETINGS...
from Mar-a-Lago!
(2028)
First hint that you'll never hear the end of it.
I guess what they say is true - time and tide wait for no one!
So this is the payoff for 30 years of 'trickle down.'
A rising tide does what again?
I liked this beach more before the Trump administration
There goes Iceland.
I see you have finally removed the MAGA from your hat...
I still don't believe in global warming and refuse to let a little climate change ruin a perfectly good vacation!
I think I just got a nibble.
The umbrella's no help.
China is really going overboard trying to fake global warming.
I still think it's fake news.
Now aren't you glad you signed that petition against those wind turbines? They would've really spoiled this view.
Not yet, Bob.  I want to wait for the tide to go out so we can see our old chimney.
I thought “being underwater” was just a financial term
Now that the tide is going out, I suggest you put your trunks back on. Please.
Ya gotta give those clever Chinese a lot of credit.  They sure know how to play up their global warming hoax!
Your prostate must be behaving today.   You haven't had to excuse yourself since we got here.
I think you misunderstood what the beach guard meant by "surf's up."
It's still not warm enough to be global warming.
We may have to rethink our position on climate change, Herb.
Dear, I don't think we should use the weather reports from Fox News anymore.
When I promised to stay with you come hell or high water, I chose my conjunction very carefully.
Tides aren't proven science
I guess that review was written before the ice caps melted.
It wasn't just me, Barbara. You were certainly happy at the time to host that Scott Pruitt fundraiser.
Low tide is at 3.47 and then you’ll see who picked the best godamn spot on the beach
The New American Gothic
No,no. No need to wake your mother.
'" You didn't hide your phone in your sneaker again, did you?"
Do you believe in global warming now?
Houston we have a problem.
I still think it is pseudo-science
I know what you're doing, Roger.
I told you not to talk to the timeshare people.
Where are the kids?
I think it's time for a new weather app.
I know but we got a great parking spot.
OK, you were right. But the water temperature is perfect.
Makes you think.
The blue wave is not going to spoil my vacation.
Next year, the Hendersons get the timeshare during hurricane season.
At least we don’t have to walk to the bathroom.
And the liberal media said the oceans would rise - please! I can still feel the sun on my neck.
I know it's your favorite spot, Fred, and you think climate change is a hoax. But I'm telling you. This IS low tide.
When Donald sold it to us he said it was 'no problem'. So, it must not be a problem.
Global what now?
Hard to believee Mar a Lago was right under us
Want to go to a movie tonight? I hear “An Inconvenient Truth” has got good reviews
You'd think that somebody would have warned us.
I made sandwiches.
screw global warming, we're standing our ground.
We’ve finally found the perfect spot.  No crowds.
Please dear, tell me again about the climate change "hoax."
Those Chinese sure are good at hoaxes
No chance that some schmuck will block our view this time.
Years ago they said it had an ocean view.
I don't understand.  He was extremely strong and powerful in his denial of a high tide.
What's that melting iceberg doing out there?
Republican picnic.
Did the water just suddenly get warmer Harold? Again?
Fox News said high tides are a part of the natural weather cycle.
Good thing you got here early to claim this spot.
You suggested Mar-a-Lago, not me.
You wouldn't listen to Al Gore.
I told you we should have tipped the beach chair guy.
Strange how the water goes warm every so often.
If you can explain why we are sitting here I won’t file for divorce.
Admittedly it's a little damp, but on the positive side, we have the beach to ourselves.
If Trump says the oceans aren't rising, then the oceans aren't rising.
This is such a hoax!
Why does your mother keep screaming like that?
Go to Florida” they said, “it’ll be nice” they said
Shall we put a message in that bottle?
Alaska 2050, your vacation destination!
No Kevin, I mean our marriage is literally underwater.
Well Charles, have you finally reconsidered your "global warming is bunk" position?
The resort did boast 'ocean at your fingertips', you know?
I'm half tempted to go for a swim.
When the drought hits, I say sell.
Next time, if you want a bonfire, don't steal the wood from tbe beavers.
I know I promised to stay come hell or high water. But this is ridiculous.
What would make you think the kids won't turn up once the tide goes back down?
Glad we rented the umbrella!
I really wish you'd stop humming, "sittin' on the dock of the bay!"
I know we should move, but that view.
I've got that sinking feeling again, Albert.
Well, thinking positively we'll now be able to pee without leaving our chairs.
If you sing “the tide is high, but I’m holding on” one more time, I swear I will leave you.
You okay down there, son?
Thank goodness we brought lifeguard chairs.
Well in my opinion, the beach is half empty.
Honey, why is that dolphin wearing your bathing suit?
I have some land in Florida" he said.  "I need a good tax shelter" you said
Did you notice the cartoonist forgot to add shade?
These Hurricane re-enactments are total tourist traps.
Make America What? Again
I told you we should have bought flood insurance.
I've completely forgotten about my hemorrhoids.
And to think...all this could have been prevented if we had just let the free market regulate itself.
At least the rain has stopped.
Well how long a we going to stay in denial.
This is the last time we say we'll take "first available."
I don't mind the ice caps melting, but a little ozone now and then would be nice.
I’ve had it up to here with this beach!
A tidy place, they said
You better hope a vodka drink floats by next.
Remember how we loved relaxing here when it was our rooftop deck.
Are you gonna drink that beer?
Guess I misunderstood the realtor when she said we were getting a great deal 'cause this place had been under water
Let’s visit the North Pole,” you said. “Frolic with the penguins,” you said. Do you see any penguins
Enough already with the climate change denial, Harry. Those aren’t nuns out there. They’re penguins.
Do you have the keys or do I?
I suppose we could go swimming.
Still a tide denier, Harold?
But her emails...
Hamptons Global Warming Gothic
So I said, "It's customary to tip the captain." And I believe your words were, "No way. What the heck could he do to us?"
Climate change? Fake news.
This certainly beats the crowds of low tide.
I told you to go before we left, dear.
I blame the Chinese.
Even after fifteen years you still know how to make me wet.
Do you believe in climate change now, Steve?
Who'd you vote for, again?
It’s our spot and I am not giving it up that easily.
Forget the water, why do the hills behind us look like ass-cracks?
Being blind sucks sometimes.
No, I don't see a problem with climate change. Who knew one day we could enjoy the beach without leaving Nebraska?
Look at the bright side, climate change is bringing beach-front property to the masses.
Honey, you were right. Reykjavik really is the new Riviera.
Our President says it's a myth and I believe him!
It's a fine line between "principled" and "stubborn", Jerry.
So, what number is this on your bucket list?
This isn't what I meant when I asked for an immersive vacation experience.
Still pleased with your 20% discount for booking out of season dear?
Well, they did say it would be sunny.
Thank goodness for climate change.  Without it we would never have known what a wonderful view we have from our roof.
My summer reading about the global warming hoax is all wet.
Off Season" and global warming, no wonder its so "reasonable.
I don't think your trunks are going to float back harry.
Damn you Frank......I just felt warm water ......
Ok, Ok next year we will go to Burning Man
Now they'll call you High Water Mark.
I'm not playing footsie!  I thought you were.
Trust me, seven hours from now, people would kill for this spot.
But you gotta admit, the price was great.
‘First it was our mortgage and now this!”
Well, which is it: global warming or climate change?
Trust me. When the tide goes out this will be the best spot on the beach!
The tide is high but I’m holdin’ on. Could be a song in that Doris.
When does the tide come in?
Thanks, Obama.
Low tide used to be so boring before climate change.
Maybe next year we should go to the mountains.
Global warming", you said. . ."Let's go to the beach and soak up some of that sun", you said. .
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to spend our vacation surrounded by water.
You had to say 'Come hell or high water' !
I'm never going to hear the end of this, am I?
I've got minnows.
Did you remember the shark repellent?
I didn't think pulling out of the Paris Accord would come to this?
Honey, the tide is high and I’m moving on.
At least the fish is fresh.
The liberal media won't tell you that Kansas can be lovely over the holidays.
Do you think of this as a metaphor for our marriage?
We're going to need a bigger towel.
Told you it was real.
Do you think our umbrella policy will cover the flood?
Is there an off'-chance that you confused the tidal chart with the shuttle bus schedule?
Still think it is politically motivated Frank?
Let's invite Steve Bannon.
Well, this explains the complimentary life jackets.
Is that Al Gore I hear snickering behind us?
Still think we won a cruise, or will you FINALLY admit that it was a robo-call?
All I'm saying is, when you drink beer with an overactive bladder there are consequences.
Going with the flow is not as relaxing as I'd hoped.
I don't know what all this climate change talk is about, the weather feels fine to me
Are you sure he said, ‘Until depth do us part?’
Is this what you meant when you said we'd be going on this vacation come hell or high water?
I know you said we were going to the beach come hell or high water, but seriously?"
Well,it was beachfront when we bought it.
I think if we have one more year of global warming, we're going to have to move the umbrella.
In a few hours we'll have the best spot on the beach.
Most failed marriages occur within 3 feet of water.
Land shark.
Morning news said we’ve got a good hour still before we gotta move”
Between global warming, and being under water with our mortgage, I think we're sunk.
Fish sure are biting today.
That one wave looks like a signature.
The water's refreshing, but exactly where is our backyard grill?
You say coastal erosion. I say global warming. Dumbass.
Yeah, it's definitely a hoax.
If you need another beer, Al, go down to the kitchen yourself.
Pruned bottom, tan on top. Global warming line 2018
Have you seen the kids?
I thought you meant our mortgage.
Look, 5-6 years years ago it would have cost 10 times as much.
I always thought you'd leave me high and dry.
First a beer can.
Next a mass of plastic straws.
Funny ... I didn't hear Biblical Flood in the forecast.
Frankly, I like it better when it was a glacier.
Is that you, sweetie?
'I don't care', you said. 'I'm voted for him anyway', you said.
Told you that we should have sold the beach property before the icebergs melted.
I can’t believe you’re still telling our friends we’re Republican.
The line is short now.  Want another beer?
Isn't climate change is a bitch?
Next year we need to book with a travel agent who is not a climate change denier."
Somehow I still feel my phone vibrating in my pocket.
You're sure the ad said ocean front and not ocean floor?
And we're in Idaho.  Think what the tides are like in LA.
That wasn't the 'Blue Wave' I was hoping for.
Whatever possessed you to kill that albatross?
Next time let's not make our reservations so far in advance.
When I said I wanted to get away from it all, I didn't mean land.
Hmm. Maybe melting the polar icecaps does matter.
Whatever you´re doing, stop it.
Maybe from now on you will let me read one or two of the bad reviews.
Just remember, what we see and what we hear isn't happening.
At least we're not being bothered by any ants.
I told you, we didn’t have the beach to ourselves for no reason.
When I ordered a beer float, this isn't what I had in mind.
Did you just pee?
Maybe we shouldn't have voted third party.
Globe may be warming, but the water is still cold.
I guess it's too late to wake up your mother.
Yes, but when the tide goes out, we'll have a really nice spot.
Low tide just isn’t the same anymore
I'd like to see the HOA tell me not to water my lawn now
Please tell me those are your toes I feel!
Where did Noah say we should be by 2?
Yes Donny, the rise in sea level theory is a hoax made up by those bad people who hate us.
Well, at least I won't hear you fart...
Noah, didn't DJT say that he was going to drain the swamp? Yes Naamah, but what can we expect from a guy who says he lives on the 68th floor of a 58 story building?
It is low tide, dear.
It looks like I won that global warming argument.
Well,​ at least we don't have to get up to get in the water.
It appears that the Jersey Shore has come to us.
Let's do this again, but at low tide.
When did we decide to go in the water?
Stop it with your "climate change" nonsense,Harold!  It just happens to be really humid today.
Tell me that was you.
We are staying.  We've been through hell and high water to get here.
I've said it before but I will say it again, God buried fossil fuels because he loves to see us find them.
Well, this beachfront was a bargain.
It's called sun bathing, Philip. Sun. Bathing.
Hmm..dear, please tell me that is you playing footsies
The swamp extends to Mar-a-lago
No, I’m fine. I’m wearing waterproof makeup.
I think they've forgotten your gin and tonic.
It still doesn't mean global warming has a human cause.
Not seagulls, those are buzzards.
It IS the humidity.
I'm not leaving until they bring the free drink they advertised.
If it's global warming, how come the water is so cool?
Are you tired of winning yet, Wilbert?
Okay you’ve seen the tide. Now can we go?
My water just broke
Perhaps we should wake up Sarah.
Honey, seriously? And give up that great parking spot?
Climate Change... Global Warming...  I don't think it matters what we call it anymore.
I now understand why your perfect spot was uninhabited.
Are you SURE you turned off the sprinkler?
So, its beach front now.
Not a word about trump. I’m serious.
Well at least our taxes are lower
You had to spill the bottomless margarita?
Remind me to  drown our travel agent"
Honey, where are the kids?
It's snowing in Aspen, so your argument is invalid.
I think we need to start thinking about selling our place.
I think the timeshare presentation was not entirely accurate
I don't know, Fred.  I thought global warming would mean BETTER beach days.
That was quite a downpour.
Pay extra for the ocean view, you said. It'll be so worth it, you said. Your sister will be so impressed, you said.
Did I not ASK you to go BEFORE we sat down?
There must be more to that Chinese hoax than we realized.
When you said it was under water, I thought you meant the mortgage.
Maybe so, but at least we got a good deal on the timeshare.
On the plus side, we only need half as much sun blcok.
When the ad said 'waterfront view' I imagined something a bit different.
“Its getting late. Are you sure Noah chose us?”
I'd really like to get out of this time share.
Just wait. Low tide will be perfect.
Don’t think of it as severe flooding, but rather a surplus of natural resources.
Nothing better than Alaska in November
Good thinking on that condo in Omaha.
We've paid for 8 hours...so 8 hours is what we'll have.
I thought we'd be safe in Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe said climate change was a hoax.
I hate to admit it, but Al Gore was right.
It's not global warming it's all water they got from draining the swamp.
Come hell or high water, David and Jennifer were determined to enjoy their holiday!
I was going to ask where the bathroom is but nevemind.
I may have to rethink my position on global warming.
Well, you were right about the umbrella.
Wet enough for ya?
Could be global warming. Or merely a metaphor for our marriage.
Did you bring the big towels?
I swear to God, Janet. That idiot, Al Gore said it would be this bad by 2014... well it's 2018, Janet. Do not debate me"
I thought rising sea levels would not be a problem in Denver.
This is not like the Alaska Winters of my childhood.
But Tom, an offshore wind farm would ruin our view.
Something’s nibbling on my Johnson.
Enjoy it George, it’s my vacation too.
Phyllis, if you didn't want anyone to see your cellulite...you could have just worn pants.
If rising sea levels continue nude beaches will become more popular but less fun.
How about we keep our feet to ourselves, Derek?
I have that sinking feeling again Dave.
I remember the beach being wider last year.
And I called you a sucker for buying beachfront property in Phoenix.
Mermaid  Family Vacation
I’m starting to think those climate scientists were onto something.
I guess I didn't factor in the full moon.
This better be high tide
I forgot.  After burying mom in the sand did we unbury her?
LIMERICK: It was a creative way that they died...Claudia, with Mike by her side...Used sea level rise...To meet their demise...Global warming -Assisted suicide.
...wow...that's one big cruise ship they got there...
On the other hand, he was right about the size of the inauguration crowd.
Just shut up and pass the sunblock.
How long were we asleep?
When should we acknowledge that you were wrong about low tide?
Ok, so maybe the tide report isn’t “fake news.”
Are you absolutely sure you understand how tides work?
Did someone say “drain the swamp”?
Next time let's just walk to the restrooms."
This reminds me, did you shut off the sprinkler before we left?
It's high tide we got out of here.
Yup. There was a hole in the boat.
For twenty years, Bill and Jen always set up their beach umbrella in the SAME exact spot.
Didn't I tell you we'd have beachfront property in the Poconos one day?
OK, maybe I'll admit there might be 'some' global warming.
I wanted beach front, not water front.
The brochure said ocean view,
What can I say ?
Well I don't miss the radio. All that nonsense about climate change.
I''m beginning to grow tired of this Chinese hoax.
I don't think Mom and Dad are coming back.
Not everyone knows how to beat the crowds.
Good thing you brought the umbrella- wouldn't want to get wet.
Henry and Elise sit on their deck still refusing to believe.
I'm starting to believe in global warming.
Don't tell me it's impossible.  Get us out of this time share.
That was sudden.
Time and tide”, ya know
Was that a crab or are you just happy to see me?
We have to sit here, stoically, Henry, and pretend global warming is fake news...
Post Hurricane discount my ass.
Technically, we're snowed in.
On the other hand, I can pee without anyone knowing.
You checked the tide schedule,my ass!
Where's your snowball now, Senator Inhofe?
If you see our waitress, can you ask for some straws?
I hadn't realized that so much of our life would be impacted by our mortgage being " under water ".
Global warming never really bothered me until today.
So this is the wet bar?
I should have known something was wrong when I asked Siri the weather forecast, and she just gave a demonic laugh!
Well, I didn't vote for him either.
Well, at least we beat the crowds and found good parking.
Just a little while longer, hon. I just know we'll see a dolphin.
No,Carl ... It’s the humidity.
So this is live streaming....
Huh...I guess Al Gore was right.
Typical you remembered your beer and forgot your bathing suit.
Did you check the faucet before we left?
Kind of makes me wish we had gone with an electric car in the 90's.
Because I haven't waxed. I'm not going to explain what that means.
Atleast it's sunny.
The hardest part is getting the water past your waist. After that it's really enjoyable.
Say what you will about climate change, but the Kansas coast is lovely this time of year.
Pessimist will say that we are half in  water
Don't pay any attention...it's just a Chinese hoax.
This so-called global warming thing is starting to annoy me.
Dam’s gone. I told you not to chase that beaver away.
This water is cold.  I still don't believe in global warming.
Alexa, play "The Tide is High."
I understand this can happen when everybody flushes their toilet at the same time.
well, i'm wet for the first time in years
You and Donald are the only two who don't believe in global warming
I'm so glad you took early retirement from the oil company.
Good thing global warming is a hoax.
The bait shop tide table was wrong again.
Bert and Esther were still confused by the concept of 'tides'.
The Chinese are doing a great job selling this conspiracy.
Maybe it's time to believe the climatologists, Frank.
Just be patient, in 12 hours we will have the best spot on this beach.
Well...shit.
I believe in global warming, I just didn't expect it to come to the Cape.
It's OK.  Trump said it was fake tide.
So... this is how you got crabs?
If the car hasn’t floated away, I would like to go home now.
Honey I think we’re in over our heads.
All I'm saying is if it's global warming why is my beer still cold?
I didn't take it literally when they said our property was under water.
This explains the un-crowded restrooms.
When they said the icebergs were melting, I thought we could make it through the weekend!
When you said this vacation might put us underwater, I didn’t take you literally!
Exactly how much empirical evidence do you require to revisit your position on climate change Frank?
Harold, is that your toe?
Cheer up. This isn't happening.
So you still think global warming doesn't exist?
I swear he said the Ark was on its way...
Is it me, or is the water getting warmer?
Pretty soon we may be in over our heads.
You definitely turned off the faucet?
Well, at least the kids are quiet.
I voted for Gore.
Well, Owen, the sand castle is gone.
I just feel like we're drifting apart.
I know you wanted to stay until hell or high water, but....
A rising tide lifts all beers.
It’ll be a great spot at low tide.
The water got warmer......did you just pee?
No, I’m not playing footsie with you. Why?
I told you not to make fun of Noah.
I really wish you didn't worry so much about having sand kicked in your face.
Should have brought a larger umbrella.
I do miss the polar bears.
I guess this will tide us over until dinner.
So, Bubba, do you think there just might be something to this global warming fake news?
It's not even a dry heat.
Say what you will about global warming. We can finally afford waterfront property."
Any other inconvenient truths you want to tell me about while we're on the subject, dear?
Go with the flow. This is the new normal.
It's a wet heat.
Oh look, there's some ice cap for you beer.
Fake news. There is no such thing as global warming.
I'm figuring it's either your ragged, ungroomed toenail or a barracuda.
I thought you said things couldn’t get any worse.
Remember, the realtor said ..”Sure the water might come up ‘someday’..but not ‘till the icecaps melt.”
Do you believe in climate change now ?
So this is the blue wave!
I don't care if it's a hoax, it's ruining our vacation.
Did you put the potato chips in a Ziplock?
How much was the hotel? I'm worried we'll be in over our heads.
I don't believe the sea level is rising, I think the beach is falling.
I know, but Tsunami Beach sounded so exotic!
Not only is the mortgage on our beachfront property underwater...
Did you leave the tub on?
Damn, more fake news!
You still standby Trump pulling out of the climate accord?
A rising tide may lift all boats, but we don't have a boat, honey.
No Harold,  time-shares were a bad idea even before global warming
They say the worst problem in these parts is beach erosion.
No more vacations to the Grand Canyon, Harry, until we get this global warming thing fixed!
You said we were ON the water.
Timeshares always lie.
They're pretty strict about lighting barbecues on the beach, aren't they?
We don't need a beach pass -- everything below the high-water line is public domain.
George, either you're getting frisky, or some sort of sea creature is nibbling on my leg.
Their sign mentioned table service?
We blame it on the liberal press.
Are we real Republicans if we believe in global warming?
There's no such thing as 'global warming.' It's just that there's too much water.
Harry, I think the Tsunami Warning takes precedence over the UV Alert right now.
The Andersons emerge from the depths, fully formed.
It's been ten years since the last time we were underwater.  I didn't like it then and I don't like it now.
I tell you, it's not global warming - it's the excess sponge farming.
Can you imagine how bad this would be if climate change was real?
Quick -- what Blondie song am I thinking of?
Siri, when's the next low tide?
Don't worry.   It's only a hoax.
Water we going to do?
The tide is high and I’m moving on.
We don't need to sink to their level.
Trump would STILL deny climate change.
You mean Climate Change is Real?
Then you said,”It’s just a small leak, I’ll fix it in the morning.”
"Don't be such a pessimist. Maybe the beach is sinking."
The Smiths are successfully denying global warming.
In hindsight, I would have thought the name "High Tide Estates" would have made you think twice before cashing-in our 401K.
Not exactly my idea of an immersion vacation.
It's a good thing I'm more of a "beach half full" type of person.
American Gothic meets climate change
This water is toxic, thanks to Scott Pruitt.
It’s funny how you miss the little things.  Like low tide.
It's a spot we can always have to ourselves.
I guess we both dozed off.
Sandwich?
I wish it wasn't so sunny all the time."
We’re never vacationing in Louisiana again.
I don't care, I'm not giving up my favorite spot on the beach!
This has been and will always be our spot on the beach, even if our climate-change believing friends don't want to be with us on vacation anymore.
I want a divorce.
Well Helen, I think this day at the beach will tide us over until next year.
This time I’m an optimist and say it’s half empty.
So, now our vacation home is underwater too?
Ya know, if wasn't for the total paralysis caused by the jelly fish stings, this would be a top ten day.
In hindsight we could have used half as much sunscreen.
It's nice to be so immersed on our vacation
Buy beachfront, you said.  My mother told me to never listen to you when it comes to real estate.
It's fine, I'm swamped at work too.
Could you hand me my towel, dear?
Sure, global warming makes it hot.  But no one talks about how refreshing the melting ice-cap is.
I sure hope it's high tide!
You can try, but I don't think the RV will start.
No worries; the sun block is water-proof.
I’m glad we just bought the time share and not the whole condo.
You saying that we're also "half dry" isn't helping.
Think we should relocate before the tide comes in?
No way,  I am not going to give up our spot on the beach.
So, this is what they meant by "ocean front property".
Well, I hope there's a Cabana buoy.
When will it be cool to scream for help?
I guess ‘drain the swamp’ meant something else here too.
We need to factor in global warming when we plan our next vacation.
... and that's when Harvey and Dolores realized the importance of tide charts.
That's not my ankle.
I don’t get it. I feel much cooler.
I don't know, Lisa, I just feel like our marriage is sinking
I'm thinking we should've gone with the garden view.
This used to be the Boardwalk.
Had enough of your "quiet beach with no screaming kids"?
do you think we should reconsider our stance on global warming.
I can't remember the last time I was this hot and wet.
Is it global warming or bladder control? It Depends!
I still wouldn’t have voted for Hillary.
I guess they didn't drain the swamp after all
Tell me again why pulling out of the climate agreement was a good thing.
Maybe we should've recycled.
D'ya think we're carrying this "denier thing" a bit too far??
Any second thoughts?
C’mon, Mildred. You know truth isn’t always truth.
This is fake water.
Nothing like a little sea level rise to help cool off from global warming.
Should we leave before high tide?
At least I don’t have to get up to pee.
Well, at least I didn't vote for him.
So is this the new low tide?
Please tell me that is YOU playing footsie with me.
Did you remember to lock the front door?
So, still not convinced about the science?
It's high tide we headed back.
It's fine.  I don't believe in global warming.
Global warming is colder thanI thought it would be
This is not the way I remember Oshkosh.
Go on, Howard. Tell me again how Climate Change isn't real.
Is it me, or did the water just get warmer?
So much for insisting on ocean front accommodations, Mr. Amateur Travel Agent.
Phil, did you remember to water the plants before we left?
Oh, all right - climate change is real.
I'm so tired of that Al Gore
I don’t care you left your trunks at home. This is ridiculous.
Beachfront property you said. Global climate change was a lie you said. Free pool in the back yard you called it. Honestly Sid, I’m beginning to rethink your whole investment strategy.
Say what you will about climate change being a hoax ... meanwhile, 'Cape Cod real estate' is becoming an oxymoron!
I think suicide by global warming will one day overtake firearms, self poisoning and jumping!
From Florida with love, Happy New Year 3018.
Was that tide tracking app free?
That's the last time I get a beachfront Airbnb from Sen. Inhofe
My rosé tinted glasses aren't working, how about you?
I don't care.  Florida is still my happy place.
We should have done something when he pulled out of the Paris accord!
Maybe there is something to this whole global warming thing.
Will you at least admit that I was right about Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt?
Was it 'til death do us part" or 'til the creek rises?'
The realtor said it was perfect for flippers.
Oh George, the ocean’s waters aren’t rising, the dunes must have moved forward.
Still stranded on their roof, Nick and Jill take advantage of the situation
Are you familiar with the tipping point ?
Luckily, the rising ocean is helping offset the extreme heat.
Wasn't the swamp supposed to be drained?
Don't worry, Congress says the rising tide is going to lift us.
And you claimed climate change was only fiction.
Next time I'll pick the spot.
I'm thinking we should add a second floor to the condo - with a large veranda.  And get a boat.
Is that your foot dear?
I liked low tide better.
So tell me more about this global warming...
Don't let me catch you eying the younger mermaids.
Yes, honey, global warming is a hoax. This is just high tide.
Do you have a tissue?
So just what were you going to tell the kids about your vote in Congress on the climate hoax?
It's never been harder to deny climate change and enjoy a sandwich.
This relationship is drowning me.
I pray this isn't low tide.
Global warming! Global schwarming! Trump should just have Sessions lock her up for making America sink.
Don't worry; it's all a hoax.
Now we know what they mean by 'Immersive Vacation'.
Wow, the Chinese sure put a lot of effort into their hoaxes.
Burning Man is looking pretty good now, huh?
I told you, honey, ‘tide’ is more than just a laundry detergent.
The water is warm though
Told you we wouldn't have to walk to the bathroom.
I knew we should have joined the Paris Climate Agreement!
Why are you wearing your hat sideways? You’re 40.
You still think "Global Warming" is fake news?
A rising tide lifts all *boats*. You have to own the boat first.
I think I have to pee
What were you saying about climate change ?
Great, the cooler floats. Do you want to swim out and get it?
I've always loved Denver.
This oughta tide you over, until lunch.
Be right back—just wanna get my toes a little dry.
We're going to need more towels
I told you we needed the waterproof sunscreen.
I told this would be beach front some day.
Finally no more bikini waxing!
Tell me you did use the Glad sandwich bags.....
Taking the plunge had a different meaning on our wedding day.
I said "buy taller chairs" but you said "no, global warming is fake".
2065
I hate it when you drink to much
This is your idea of dinner on the water?
We should go, dear. Time and tide wait for no one!
And I thought it was just our mortgage that was underwater!
Sundeck on the roof of your cottage, the ad said.
We were promised an ocean view, but this is ridiculous.
What did I say- global warming is a myth. This water is freezing!
That better be a snake!
So here we are in Mar-a-Lago - now do you believe in karma?
Was climate change supposed to smell this bad, darling?
How long ago did we eat?

Redneck waterpark.
Well, it is less crowded than I expected.
They were right about the oceanic view.
Timing is everything when you hit the beach at the Bay of Fundy...
I still think it's a Chinese hoax.
I thought we were above these ebbs and flows.
Good! We finally got a table with a view of the water
Ebb tide, flow tide, neap tide - who can keep them straight?
I’m assuming that warm patch was you?
There was no reason to build an arc because climate change isn't real and this shouldn't be happening.
I still insist that global warming is fake news.
I'm so glad we remembered the umbrella.
Maybe there’s something to that Global Warming thing.
So are you still against reading the reviews?
Prime waterfront location used to mean something different.
Not quite what I meant by watching the tide come in.
How many times do I have to tell you - there is global warning. Perhaps now you will listen to me!
My family has been coming to this beach for generations and I intend to keep the tradition.
When they said the mortgage was underwater - I didn't think they meant literally.
Good thing I hate dry humor.
Do you think anyone will realize that we are two very tiny people in a very large rum punch?
At least we won't have to pay extra to get the fish pedicure at the spa.
This umbrella worked great. Not a drop of rain on my hat.
Do you think the bagels are still good?
Well, It ain't floatin' MY boat!"
I see you also forgot to pack your common sense.
Is that your foot?
Siri said the tide was going out.
I take it your more of a lake person.
Please tell me you’re playing footsies with me.
Not to worry. It's SPF 100 and it 's waterproof.
I thought you said it was a dry heat.
Well, that's one Labor Day down the drain...
I just felt something. For the first time in years.
Should we call Noah and upgrade to a suite?
Somehow I imagined the glaciers taller.
I don’t believe in global warming, either.

I can't see the kids either.
I’m absolutely positive. TripAdvisor ranked this as the #1 thing to do here.
There is no global warming.
High tide and seven years ago...
American Gothic :2050
What kind of "River Cruise" picks you up enroute?
Who knew that being just fifty feet closer to the sunset would make such a difference.
I told you we should have gone to the mountains!
Maybe we can sell it to your brother the climate skeptic.
It's a Democratic conspiracy to raise taxes.
Oh drop the politics, that warm current was definitely man made
I'm just saying there's a chance the GPS was wrong in this particular instance.
Maybe Gore is right.
I hear Milwaukee is lovely this time of year.
I blame the moon"
Aloha my ass.
Now Ralph, tell me again why you don't believe in climate change.
I knew those climate scientists were wrong about how fast the seas would rise.
Who says there is no such thing as global warming?
I told you we should’ve brought two umbrellas
Liberal hoax. This beach seems just fine to me.
Been coming to this spot for forty years. A few damn glaciers melting isn’t gonna stop me now!”
I say once you get a good spot on the beach, you STAY there.
Still think that the forty days and forty nights forecast was fake news, Noah
I never thought we would be getting an ocean-front property when we bought our house in the Catskills.
Beachfront property is so last century.

It still beats drowning at work.
You still think climate change is fake news?
Do you remember our deck being this close to the surf?
Really? The Jaws theme?

It's getting harder to keep your head above water these days.
Reach down and fish me out another diet soda
First the mortgage, now this
Maybe this is the wrong swamp.
The Jersey shore just isn't what it used to be.
Here's another inconvenient truth:  our dryer's broken.
Shoot, I think the sand castle is ruined
Well, at least our mortgage isn't the only thing we own that is underwater!
I wonder if we shouldn't sell our oil stocks.
Do you think we can still eat the sandwiches?
Of course, a tweet can have more immediacy than a message in a bottle.
What were you saying about global warming?
There goes another glacier.
So much for investment in underwater properties.
Do I have to explain the difference between climate and weather again?
And this is why we don’t nap at the same time.
Swell, isn't it?
Hmmm, not really what I had in mind when you said  we're heading to 'Wet 'N Wild', hun.
In this day and age, even a day at the beach is no day at the beach.
Global warming feels good.
I still believe the tide tables are false news - they are produced by the deep state at NOAA.
Still doesn’t prove climate change is real!
fuck it I'm peeing right here.
The coast is clear.
Fuck Al Gore!

D'ya suppose Obama might've been right about that whole climate change thing?
I wish I was taller.
You're right, this does add a wrinkle to the 'glass half full' debate.
I'd say the tide has turned"
YOU do something about it then!

Fake news
On the good side we'll only need half as much sunscreen.
Howard, when you go in for your physical, have your bladder checked.

That better be your leg.
A guy I know at the EPA in Washington told me confidentially, that waterfront property on Miami Beach was a great investment.

Maybe the scientists are right?
This is your fault, for voting Republican.
I told you we should have asked the sales agent why the taxes are only $49 a year on this property.
I trust that was your foot, my dear.

What vacationing with student loan debt feels like.
And you said climate change was a hoax
You better put your suit back on before low  tide.
Next anniversary, let's skip the tradition of sitting in the spot on Miami beach where we first met.
Fake news, you said! Why do I always listen to you?
When the tide comes in, we can snorkel.
I may have left the water running in the bathtub.
Wet now, sure, but once low tide hits, you'll see- this is a prime location!
OK, Harold, enough with the Zen stuff. Just admit it: the tide IS coming in.
Have you found the keys yet?
I think I see the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
"Do you think this is serious?"
So, you’ve swam with whales and dolphins, but have you sat with salmon?
Three million illegal votes, Obama bugging Trump Tower, the deep state, the corrupt security agencies, and the mainstream media conspiracies are all true, but when it comes to climate change, the evidence just isn't there. Got it.
Do we still have to wait 30 minutes after eating?
That better be a fish.
The umbrella is a real lifesaver!
What were you saying about global warming, George?
It does sound like Mai Tai. But that's not what I said.
The bad news is climate change is real.  The good news is the beach is a lot less crowded for a Saturday afternoon in August.
If this is just a hoax by China, you have to admire the special effects.
He said a rising tide would lift all boats. He didn't mention what it would do to us.
The brochure did say the beach was tidey.
Hi tide.
So should we move yet?
Well, that didn't take near as long as they said it would.
They say if we don't address global warming, in 100 years this beach will be under water.
Sure, they were predicting rising sea levels...but in Aspen?
I guess we should've listened to Al Gore after all.
Did you remember to close the windows before we left?
You know, this is a bit, inconvenient
Aqua-Uber?” I think you could be on to something Tom
going to the beach isn't what it used to be.
Your insistence that we should sit at the same place when we came for our honeymoon is "warming" indeed!
I told you not to wear your catheter to the beach.
We're not moving anywhere, Charles, until you put your swim trunks back on.
I hate to make decisions while on vacation but should we sink or swim?
I give up. Is this just another one of your sink or swim challenges”
It has nothing to do with global warming and everything to do with your failure to check the tide chart.
It appears the Rental Agent failed to tell us a few things.
Fred, I'm beginning to think there is something to this global warming.
I think I see where we parked our car.

Sun bathing - the Climate Change Years.
I bought and paid for this land and now I plan to enjoy it!
Climate change deniers.

I'm willing to  concede your point on that global warming thing,but you have to admit that you love our beachfront view of Denver .
Global Warming? There just hasn't been enough data to convince me.
Do you feel the kids?
I still believe in yur science, Paul, but if it reaches my neck, next time I vote Democratic
This umbrella did nothing to keep us from getting wet.
Guess we should have checked the global warming forecast before buying this beach front property!
Can't say they didn't warn us.
At least we still have an ocean view from our deck.
Ask me if I care.
It's fake news.  The seas aren't rising, the land's just sinking.
I don't know about you but I'm ready for a dry martini
I thought the bargain price at the High Tide Hotel was too good to be true!
What an odd pool.
I was sure that by the time we'd be on this vacation, he would have already drained the swamp.
At least it’s not crowded.
Wow!  Just wait until the tide comes in.
The brochure didn’t lie- deserted beach it is!
At least there aren't so many spring breakers anymore...
How do climate scientists benefit from sea level rise?
You ready to go yet?
Still think global warming's a hoax, do you?
On the plus side, you don’t have to get up to go to bathroom.
Good thing there is no global warming.
Next year, I'm thinking Colorado.
Not the best time share, but it was cheap.
You can't drain the swamp if the seas are rising.
Harry, do you think our kids could be onto something with their '""Go Green" nonsensce?
Just when did you say high tide was due?
Just remember the mantra "climate change is a hoax"
Not to worry, we'll be long gone by the time global warming affects us."
Honey, I believe you read the tide chart incorrectly.
I suggest we go with the flow.
Go with the flow is one of those sayings that can turn around and bite you on the ass.
So, global warming is just fake news, eh?
Harold, lately, I've been starting to doubt some of those #FakeNews tweets from the president.
I am begining to wonder if we put the proper address  into the GPS.
I won’t have the lung capacity to even out this tan.
This is not a hoax.

You think the tide's in or is it that global warming thing?
I've had it up to here with your vacations
What’s the forecast for tomorrow?
I'm beginning to wonder if climate change is really a hoax.
Don't...
I'd say 'half-empty' is the more optimistic outlook in this scenario"
Finding El Nino
Rusty and Jessica were the last participants to arrive at the high tide speed dating.
Well, at least the walk to the beach has been shortened.
I still say it's fake science.
Bottoms up?
Remember Life without Trump?
You son-of-a-bitch.
Winters in Iceland just isn't the same since global warming became a thing.
I knew the ad promising us our own private beach was too good to be true.
I didn't realize that it was snark week.
This is not what I meant by a liquid lunch.
At least there is no longer the problem of there being no ladies' room in sight.
More than the mortgage is underwater."
Did it have to be the exact same spot we sat on our honeymoon?
Please pass the Grey Poupon.
I think we really do immerse ourselves in summer vacation.
I’m wet...are you?
Next time, Mr. Pile Driver, just let me poke the umbrella into the sand.
Just make sure you keep a poker face when you do.
It's okay, Trump told us not to worry.
I told you so.
You were right. The beaches are less crowded during hurricane season.
Hurricane season isn't as fun as I remember it
It's true, you DO get shorter as you get older.
Well, at least the beach isn't crowded
I'm starting to enjoy Arctic winters.
We paid a lot for this beachfront property, and there's no way we're going to let global warming spoil it for us.
He said he’d drain the swamp.
I stand with my President - global warming is a hoax
I thought YOU taught him how to swim?
The salon brochure says that the fish eat the dead skin.
Now I know why the discount travel agent asked if we knew how to swim.
It’s not the heat, it’s the humidity.
I love Beckett too but this is ridiculous
The tide table is fake news.
Well, you're the one who said, "Let's go with the flow."
So now you're saying sea level rise is good, because it cools us on these hotter days?
So you bought this beach front because Rush assured you that global  warming was a hoaxes.
God, I love coal.
Still
a glass half full kinda guy?
What time does the ocean close?
Hon, no more sweet real estate deals with your cousin Craig. Please!!
Low tide just isn't what it was when we were young.
Well, maybe you should have questioned their ad -  “ FREE fish pedicure, wet season only”.
Plovers get the beach because THEY are nesting...
Who would have thought that global warming would deliver a lake view in our own back yard?
Well, shall we go in for a swim now?
Now I know how Puerto Rico felt, am I right? Too soon? Anyway, could you pass the sunblock?
Honey, did we turn off the tub before we left?
Honey, will you at least consider that global warming might just be real?
Did you remember to water the ficus?
When they said "Oceanfront Property," I had no idea.
I think our favorite beach spot has gone the way of our favorite position.
I don't care. This has always been our spot on the beach.
Well, the Airbnb listing said it had a wet bar.
I’m not gonna say I told you so, but......
Full moon tonight?
motherfuck, someone shoulda warned us about climate change
The brochure said 'futuristic.'
Listen, I know you said this would be an immersive experience, but...
You forgot the sunblock.
George, I can think of plenty of reasons for the unusually high water, besides that ridiculous "the ice caps are melting" theory of yours!
Go fish.
On the bright side, climate change does give us more warm days to spend at the beach
Well, Cedric. Even on vacation, you’re out of you’re depth.
Bobo, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Now I realize "High Tide is the New Low Tide" was just a marketing slogan.
I’m not sure brining is for me.
Do you ever feel like we're just treading water?
I can remember when this was a beach.
No Harry, a rising tide floats all boats, not all butts
In support of my suggestion to relocate Dear, may I remind you that Bull Sharks routinely hunt in less than three feet f water!
At low tide, in just six hours and 12.5 minutes, we'll have the best spot on the beech.
What are we wading for honey?
Honey, I know he said it’s fake news, but this feels pretty real...
Darling, have you seen my book? the new one, about global warming alarmists?
Global warming kinda crept up on us.  
Last year, this was our backyard."
You always have to see the "entire" sunset
I will stay here with you , honey, but next time remember to bring your bathing suit !
I liked this spot better before climate change.
What really bothers me is the sewage plant up the river!
And you just kept saying, there’s no global warming! Where’s the summer house? Can you tell me that?
Polar caps melting? Fake news!
Another reason we shouldn't buy beachfront property.
I still say global warming is a hoax
"Go ahead and pee, no one will notice"
Fine, Eleanor. 
Next year we’ll try a cruise.
If this wasn’t the back yard it would be kind of nice
And you didn't want to buy flood insurance.
If you don’t acknowledge Global Warming,  it won’t happen.
Numb Nuts!
This sure is a different kind of cleanse.
I don't remember there being so many birds here last time.
So, Harold, the President's lawyer advised you invest near Mar A Lago?!
I hope that big fin approaching isn't what I think it is.
I think there is some existential lesson in this, but lets just move our stuff.
Sort of reminds me of where we were in "08.
You said hurricane season started next week.
I guess there are some immediate consequences for pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement after all.
So, then, you believe climate change is for real?
Say it: Now you're happy I insisted on a deck at the beach house.
Trump is an honest man and Global Warming is a hoax.
Damn auto correct. I said I wanted a room On  the water,  not IN the water
Trump tweeted: Trust me! The tide's going out.
As they say with global warming, 'when you can't come to the beach, the beach comes to you.'
How's that "drain the swamp" vote lookin' now?
I think I know why this space was free..
Time to move
Let's keep walking.
Say what you will about global warming, it’s hard to beat these beach house rental rates.
Since I stopped believing in climate change, I find these outings much more enjoyable.
Get used to it, Bob. It's the new normal.
Gore and his crazy ideas !
Everything's fine.
'I'm guessing someone didn't check the tide charts."
Next time let’s find a place on the water rather than in the water.
Good thing it's high tide.  I just peed my pants.
It's so much nicer after Labor Day
Okay, maybe there is something to this global warming thing, but I still don't buy the evolution theory crap.
All this and the wind at our backs too!
I told you 2100 would be a bad vacation destination.
Care for another drink?
What happened to that iceberg?
I knew if we waited long enough, climate change would make our yard waterfront property.
Maybe we should have gone with the Prius.
Truth or no truth, this is certainly an inconvenient vacation.
Yes my love stallion, we are drowning in pleasure.
Now isn't this better than walking a half mile to the public restroom?
How can you tell if this is low tide or high tide?
Was that global warming or global flooding we should be concerned about?
Wonderful.  Your tide has come in.  Now what?
Wanna go back to the room?
Vacations in Puerto Rico just arent what they used to be
I always thought global warming would happen more slowly.
Sweetheart, I thought we agreed to stop discussing Al Gore.
See? It's a little cooler sitting in the shade  under the umbrella.
Well, you were the one who insisted on waterfront property.
It's definitely time to move our favorite spot back fifty feet.
This should have come before the hot yoga.
Does this strike the right note of middle-aged whimsy?
But think of the poor penguins in Antarctic.
Well, the brochure did say it was secluded and surrounded by water.
Better than sand in our suits.
I think we waited too long for the tides to turn.
I told you, Cape Cod is so last climate.
We have not been paying much attention George .
I’m secretly resisting the tide.
You said it never rains in California
I knew we were underwater with our mortgage, but you didn't say anything about the beach house.
You're right, St. Louis was still worse.
Some people just blame everything on climate change.
Please stop singing "The tide is high, but I'm holding on".
Recreations have never been more divided along party lines
Water's running a little higher this year.
Is the SEA half full or half empty?
Just ignore it, dear, and the global warming will never affect us.
I guess we should’ve taught Timmy how to tread water.
I know we said close to the water and no neighbors, but seriously...
Okay Frank, the next time you forget your bathing suit we’re either going to a nude beach or we’re going home!
I booked it on h2o bnb.
It wasn’t under water when we visited last year...
I guess they were right
This is such a lovely moment...where's your phone and selfie stick?
Thanks so much for taking me to the beach. It's so nice to get away from Atlantis and dip my head out of the water.
Is this global warming or did we run out of money.
Pretty nice, for glacier water"
I meant the tide table for Freeport Maine, sweetheart.
High tide might be a problem"
I'm glad we came after Labor Day when the crowds are gone
When they said it was an in-ground swimming pool this wasn’t what I expected.
The Pruitt's said this would be a great investment...
Good thing we brought your Mother to stand on...
I don't know. I wouldn't necessarily call it inconvenient.
Wondering if all those Sciencey Climate Changers may have a point.
We may be in denial...I'm beginning to think Neptune and Poseidon have nothing to do with this.
Just be thankful there's no climate change.  Then it would REALLY be a high tide.
I'm certain this is the wrong side of the beach front.
While I didn't agree with the architect when he first drew up the plans, I'm glad we decided to go with the roof deck.
Do you think one more beer will tide us over?
Global warming? What global warming? It is beautiful out here.
Left wing radicals probably staged this beach. Global warming is fake news, honey.
I told you the 1998 tide chart wouldn’t be accurate.

Well, now we both have crabs.
I'm beginning to care about climate change.
I see a bad moon rising.
Well, the balcony does have an ocean view.
The climate is changing faster than I expected.
I think our usual spot is too mainstream
Frankly, Bob, I think you're all wet.
If you tell me one more time how cheap it was...
It looked different on their website.
When did you say low tide was?
Well, at least Steve Bannon isn't headlining the New Yorker Festival.
Yo mamma is so fat, she caused this tide
I’m leaving you for somebody who believes in climate change.
We've got the worst service dog.
Well, the fish should be fresh.
"This is the last time I book a vacation through Al Gore Tours.
At least it's warm...
I'm fine.
Ocean front in Kansas isn't working for me.
Did you remember to bring the sunscreen?
Honey, next time you buy 'oceanfront property,' please ask for a tract on the land side of the ocean.
Sure, rising tides lift all boats but, if you hadn't noticed, we don't have one.
A lot faster than they predicted.....
I like this spot, Bob. It makes you look good in your Speedo.
I told you we were too close to the water,but noooooo!
Quit stalling, George! It's YOUR turn to turn off the sprinklers!
Maybe it's time to consider ordering a Tesla, dear.
I'm just about ready to give up on novelty restaurants.
Time to admit that the waters around us have grown?
Do you remember where we burried Jimmy?
Waterfront is sooo ten years ago, Bubba.
Do you feel something wet?
I said I wanted to spend our vacation on the shore...the SHORE.
You have to admit, climate change is refreshing
This is what not draining the swamp really looks like.
So your main concern is a sudden rip tide?
See.  I told you it would be just a matter of time that Kansas City would become a great market for beachfront property.
Oh look, there's the cruise ship we should be on!
No, I still think global warming is some sort of hoax.
The good news is the timeshare is only a lease.
If we give up and move now, the tide will never respect us.
Is it must me, or did this rising sea level thing happen all of a sudden?
You promised the swamp would be drained!
So Far So Good
It's just an anomaly. Everything's going to be fine...
I expected a somewhat different Antarctica.
Don't be such a pessimist
And to think they laughed at us when we bought this ocean front property.
At this rate we have more than enough in our retirement fund.
Climate resilience
Your beer can is floating away on the Chinese hoax.
I blame global-warming on Anonymous.
Are you still denying climate change?
being a merman is nothing to be ashamed of, dear.

Lover's quarrels: When neither gives in too easily.
This Gilligan and Ginger thing's getting old. Let's be the Professor and a mermaid named Blanche.

Yes, I still believe global warming is a hoax
We haven't been this far underwater since 2008.
I'm having a sinking feeling global warming isn't a hoax.
I feel our relationship is drowning.
I will drown in this ocean before I admit you were right about high tide, Joe. I. Will. Drown.
Next year I choose our spot at the climate change denial festival.
Is it me, or does that cruise ship seem close to shore?
Next summer we're going to Idaho.
Great idea stuffing the car keys in your shoes. 
No one's going to steal them now.
A few more years of this hoax global warming and we're going to drown.
You do understand what I meant when I said I wanted to be on the water, right?
I still prefer the old patio, before the house washed away.
Boy, when the tide comes in, the tide comes in.
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted an immersive experience!
I say we do something when it gets up to our necks.
No, you will go find a port-a-potty.
They said so to Rome for your honeymoon they said it'll be fun they said.
We should have listened to your friend Noah
...not exactly the Instagram post I envisioned sharing from our beach holiday.
You know, I'm becoming less convinced that global warming is a Chinese hoax.
I knew he wouldn't drain the swamp...
Bill, please.
I told you it had great water views.
I used to have such fun here as a little girl.
This isn’t like the commercial at all!
I hate it when Moses comes to the beach.
This is low tide!
Keep an eye on her. Let's not let her go out too far.
The dunes seem to be working.
If global warming was real, we'd be up to our necks in it.
That's not me, Margaret, and furthermore I don't appreciate the tone in your voice.
You did a nice job with the umbrella but what does that matter?
The airbnb did say that it was only steps from the beach.
Now do you believe in global warming, Kyle?
Still think it's a hoax?
I was told this beach is to die for.
I guess it only works for boats...
I wanted a dip in the lake, not to be a dip in the lake!
I'd appreciate you using an actual bathroom, dear.
At least we have the beach to ourselves.
__Now__  [underlined] do you believe those ‘so-called climate experts?’
Yes dear, just like Arizona except maybe not such a dry heat.
Well, I think our little snooze is over.
Drain the swamp? What swamp? This right here is paradi -- uh, is the water getting higher to you?
Summer 2020: Orange Fool’s Beach
At least we got a good discount.
Darling, too late to worry about climate change.
Yes, I understand the mortgage analogy.
Oh, look. It's the end-of-summer tsunami.
Global warming isn't a fake after all.
I liked it better when we thought it was a mirage.
If you say 'I was sure we had at least five hours before the tide came  in' one more time I'm going to drown you."
Well, we're saved the walk to the shoreline...
The humidity is killing me!
Laying on the beach is so overrated
It doesn't FEEL like Antarctic melt-water...
Global warming is nonsense. It feels cooler to me this summer.
Now will you finally admit this deal was too good to be true?
I said merry time not maritime. Another example of your not listening.”
So this is what our mortgage feels like.
I guess the high tide sign wasn't fake news after all.
Look honey!  Isn’t that our chimney out there?
Is this what the kids mean when they say they are waisted?
I’ve got a lobster trapped between my feet. Get the net.
This will be a great spot once the tide goes out.
Still think the rise in sea levels is fake news, Harold?
Yes, I still believe the President when he says global warming is fake news.  The sand is just wetter.
I’ve had it up to here with all-in vacations.
Well, I guarantee you that other people in Dallas think this is not 'just a little beach erosion.'
This was the perfect spot last year.
I told you to go before we left the house.
Next time I say 'Check the 10-year forecast,' maybe you'll listen.
Let's bring our snorkel masks next year.
Be happy we're not in Florida.
Well, he said he would drain the swamp.

I suspect another iceberg melted this morning.
I...SAID...there is NO GLOBAL WARMING
Global warming is a Chinese hoax!
Just wait until it’s high tide!
See?  It wasn’t as bad as thought.  We only vacation with the fishes.
Wow. They're really committing to this whole "global warming" scam.
Well, if we drown in a hoax, at least we drown together.
I'm finding it ever harder to deny science.
I think the cooler is leaking.
This will burn off.
You’re in real hot water now, Bob.
I told you we should’ve moved to Brooklyn!

On the plus side, we don't have to use the public restrooms.
This vacation sinks.
If the water suddenly gets warmer for a minute, it wasn’t me. It’s global warming.
Well, it was 50% off.
Well, at least it stopped raining!
Now do you understand the difference between high tide and low tide?
‘Let’s sit up there where it’s not crowded,’ you said.
I used to wonder what ever happened to Key East.
Oh Dear. I guess there's a reason vacationing on Puerto Rico was so inexpensive.
We should never have been suckered in by that timeshare talk.
I'm no scientist, but I'm guessing this is about 
twenty years ahead of schedule.
There’s a lot more water than I thought there'd be.
Tell me again how climate change is a hoax.
I don't understand it?  We have been coming to this same spot for years.
Twenty years from now, this will be considered low tide.

It’s high time we start believing this global warming myth.
Beachfront rental." Hah
It looks like global warming has finally come to Nebraska.

When the advertisement said " You will be immersed in the beauty of your surroundings" I didn't expect this.
I'm starting to think those global warming people might be on to something, Bill.
Thank God global warming is a Chinese hoax, other wise I would be concerned about the rising tide!
Don't stop believing....
Hardly the high water mark of our vacation.
There is no global warming, dear. It’s fake news!
Who knew rising sea levels would give us beach front property in Kansas!
I don't think this is what the doctor had in mind when he told you to soak you feet in salt water.
Now, this is beachfront property.
Where's Timmy?
I'll call your doctor if it's still a problem in six hours. For now, let's enjoy the beach.
I think your Mom is floating away.
You always wanted waterfront property. Stop complaining.
At least the sun’s not in our eyes
Well, we did say come hell or high water. [sigh].
They did say that the yard had "a water view"
See?  I TOLD you this would beachfront property one day.
I told you we're not going to waste what we spent on this timeshare.
Is this low or high tide?
Come hell or high water, this vacation is going to save our marriage.
Well honey, at least the sky's not falling.
I'm never trusting a Yelp review again.

You know Ed, with sea levels rising I feel really sorry for short people.
I knew we shouldn't have taken those Xanax this morning

Remember when we used to live here.
Well, yes, last time it WAS more romantic: without the global warming, sharks, and extra 25 years.
Are you sure it’s fake news?
I guess we should have checked the global warming situation before booking  this ski resort.

How much did we pay to rent this umbrella?
I told you that time machine was a waste of money.

I imagine it might be a tad deeper on the coast .
More waterfront isn't necessarily good!
“ OK.....time and blank waits for no man, 4 letters ......”
This is the last time we'll bring Mortons's salt on a picnic!
I said "waits for no man," Norman.
I never wanted to be a vacautionary tale.
Don’t you agree that Washington D.C has really improved since the current Presidential has taken over?
Why did the water just get warmer?
Where is the guy that said "drain the swamp"?
Ed, do you think we should call it a day?
You looked thinner at high tide.
Don't think of it as flash flooding, think of it as an instant hot tub.
Well, at least, I don't have to watch my waistline.
Now we know why the rates were so low.
Who knew that the tide tables were not fake news
This fake news is making my toes wrinkly.
I prefer to stay put and contemplate tidal energies.
Suicide by high tide,...or Global warming blues.
It’s certainly been a wet summer.”
I told you it was tidal
I've waited long enough, Dave. You're a shit meteorologist. I want a divorce.
Riviera, River area, must be a typo...
Son-of-a-bitch!
It's OK, Evelyn, I had to pee anyway.

I thought your President said climate change was fake.
Can you grab the snorkel and put some sunscreen on my back?

What have we learned? Never buy a time share at low tide.
I wasted all that sunscreen on my legs.
Well, I voted for Al Gore.
Looks like the Chinese are hoaxing us again.
I can’t decide if I should go for a swim.
Bingo! I told you if we waded out here, we'd become a climate change meme.
Ski vacation next year?
We should probably start recycling.
Next time we are getting the portable chairs and umbrella set.
well, the listing did say 'open air, ocean experience'
I've had it up to here with you!
We can sleep in--there is no 'Best Spot on the Beach' any more.
I don't care what Al Gore says, I am not giving up my beachfront property.
You said rising sea levels is a scam. Could global warming be the cause of sinking beaches?
Now, that is a flash flood.
It's not global warming, it's your stupidity.
That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as global warming!
Tide's out" I said.  "Oh no" you said, "This is a perfect spot!! Go back to sleep.
so this is the real estate bargain of  the century you talked me into "
Look on the bright side, the effects of climate change are not over our heads.
Look, all I'm saying is we might want to move the house further inland.
Yes, I know who King Canute was.
Grab that beer for me, would you?
I choose the wrong day to wear socks
Where’s the baby?

I thought they were going to drain the swamp...
You peed?
Oh! I'm not worried. Donald will fix the leak.
Do you still not believe in climate change?
Mother Nature just broke her water.
I told you this would happen if we tried minding our own business.
I knew I left the faucet on
You really ARE drinking too much beer!
This must have something to do with that global warming thing people have been talking about.
It looks like climate change is changing faster than they thought.

I guess the Paris Accord was a good idea afterall.
How's deregulation working for you now?
Honey, did you happen to notice if there was a restroom back there?
Good thing I remembered the beach umbrella.
I told you to use the waterproof sunscreen.
Diss my travel agent all you want. At least I didn't just put a message in a beer can.
No Dear I do not believe in Global Warming

All right, Harry, have it your way – the sea level is not rising, but America is sinking under the national debt.”
I guess the EPA lied to us.  Boy, I hate that.
Does this tide make me look washed out?
All I'm saying Harry is when the time-share brochure says 'waterfront property' you investigate!
Psht global warming.
The brochure said canoes would be available.
Now I see why they call this resort 'Climate Change.'
Remember when we used to be only knee deep in it?
And we still have to listen to the time share yadi yada.
It’s not global; it suddenly got warmer in this spot.
Wake up, Harold! Where's the dog?

If this is really supposed to be proof of global warming, why is the water so cold?
Honey, can you pass me the beer before it floats away?
Well, at least, now, you can say you're skinny-dipping.
And you thought moving to Denver would make a difference.
The resistance focussed on shorter term threats.
If it's climate change, then why isn't the water warmer?
The Army Corps of Engineers did a nice job on the dunes.
I think the tide app on my phone is a bit inaccurate.
You still don't want to give up the spot?
you don't think it has to do with climate change do you?
Well, the realtor did say it was “water front”.
We’re here to report, “Cry me a river” is fake news.
Maybe we should have gone to see that Al Gore movie after all.
I sure hope that's your hand.
I told you you'd be glad we brought the umbrella.
I just remembered ,I left the water running in the tub upstairs.
We could have stayed at home for this...
At least Al Gore will be pleased.
Darling, when will we start the trickle of trickle-down economics?
Stop it, that tickles.
Okay, you win.  The tide is speedy here.
I still do not believe in climate change and rising sea levels.  Nobody can convince me otherwise.
You say global warmin'.
I say new swim holin'.
Warmin'.
Swim holin'.
Let's call the whole thing off.
(Really!)
Maybe we should have upgraded.
Sigh...remember when there used to be sand beaches?
Five more minutes?
Oh how the tides have changed...
At least they drained the swamp.
do you notice anything unusual?
What are you talking about? If he says its drained,its drained!
Well, think how much worse it would be if climate change weren't a Chinese hoax.
so this is a wet hoax?
So, are we just going to sit here and drown before you accept that the climate is changing?
Well, that was a big wave.
I'm starting to re-think my position on global warming.
So,do you still think it's all a Chinese hoax?
So much for climate change being fake news too,
But the president told us last year that rising sea levels was a hoax!
I guess Mother Nature was listening when you said ‘Come hell or high water, we are going to have fun on this trip.’
I don't know.  I still think climate change is a hoax.
Well, they advertized A Short Walk to The Beach,
Honey, did you shut off the water back at the cabana?
You weren't kidding about the travel agent being a real shark, were you?
Well, you did say you needed one more beach day to tide you over.
It is so nice to be able to sit with someone and just comfortably share a silence.
The fossil fuel investments giveth,and the fossil fuel investments taketh away.
Honey, water we still doing here?

Should we move the picnic basket?
Harold, I think I'd like an ice cream cone.
I thought you said French immersion .
Honey, please tell me that's your hand.
Earl, let's chuck our suits and go skinny dipping.
I can’t believe you bought this ‘dream vacation with ocean view’ , again ??
What climate change?
You've always said that you wanted seafront property.
I still deny that global warming has anything to do with it.
So much for the myth of global warming!
My gosh, this seafood really is "fresh".
It's not sea-level rise. It's me-level fall.
Honey - I thought you said 'a nice place on the water, not IN the water'
We should have believed the reports: Oceans are rising
I believe you, dear. This is a prime spot. Now that tide schedule.
Half-immersion is by far the most efficient way of learning Mermaid language.
Good thing we rented the hybrid. We could be drowning otherwise.
It’s your damn hairsprays fault!
Next year we vacation BELOW the Arctic Circle.
How soon will water-sitting be a thing?
I don't care- I'm voting for him again in 2020.
Nothing like a day "in" the beach!

Next time we leave the phones in the car.
Dang... a lot has changed since our honeymoon.
Why does everyone keep talking about climate change?

The tide's come in...
Just sayin'.
You know, on second thought, I think I will go for a dip.”
It's not about the water, Daniel. It's about your mother.
...and you said "They probably don't even SELL global warming insurance
Did you remember to turn off the lights?
Come to think of it,the brochure did mention high tide.
Well looky here, all this water and my beer’s still dry...
Mildred I told you they weren’t B.S.in about global warming!
She: The water’s a bit chilly today. 
He: well, you have to remember, this is Antarctica.
Husband: Honestly Honey, this will be beautiful once they have drained the swamp. 
Wife: But Hank, we have been sat here since January last year!
You left the bath running.
Of course I’m sure. Climate change is a myth. Also sky squiggles. Sky squiggles don’t exist.
"I'm telling you... this Global Warming thing just doesn't exist."
Alright, maybe Alaska has warmed a little...
Well, you said to get one with a big motor; I didn't think to ask if it floats.
"This is so much better than sand in your toes or up your bathing suit.
Are we having fun yet?
I told you "Global warming is real"!
I told you  we wouldn’t be submerged.
Do they serve gin and tonic here?"
"No, it's a dry zone.
I should have known better than to trust your stupid tide reports.
When did you say the tide comes in?
It's the humidity, not the heat
Where should we go on our next "Global Warming" Vacations"?
They should start calling it 'Global Wetting'"
Why do New Yorkers retire in Florida again, Bernie?
I need my sunscreen and its in my purse. Would you mind grabbing it, i left it under your chair.
So is this a tropical depression?
Hmm, seven letters, starts with "ts", ends with "i". No, nothing comes to mind.
F&*@,ing climate change!
This is the”Rooftop condo with ocean view” from Airbnb?
We shouldn't have smoked that "High Tide" strain.
Okay, I'll give in on climate change, but I still don't get the alarmists.
Thank God we republicans know it’s a big hoax.
So, you still don’t believe in global warming?
Book the trip to Antarctica way in advance," you said.
So, do you care to share your thoughts on global warming with me one more time?
I thought I requested some Origami!
What do you mean, now we're underwater twice?
These rising sea levels are seriously hampering my tan
Well, they say you never go to the same beach twice.
Isn't it enough that our house is underwater?
Be thankful it’s not waste water...
Maybe we should turn the umbrella upside down.
I was OK with the couples mani-pedi but the toothless carp are killin' me!
I'm suing the hotel.  There's hardly any beach here.

Was it worth the wade?
Please tell me your conservative views on climate change again.
What does your Fox News say about this?
No, that WASN'T my hand.
If you think this is bad, you should see this place at high tide.
At least we have that block of tickets for Hamilton this evening.
Leave it to you to wait until hurricane season.
So, what's the big deal? Aren't we sitting on the same spot where the pool used to be?
This will do until the tide comes in.
When will you learn, Harry, that you get what you pay for?
Who was it that said something about time and tide?
I guess an ocean view is included
...why does the water feel suddenly warm?
Al Gore was right.
It'll be easier to watch the kids from here.
That reminds me - I think I left the oven on.
Don't say global warming again ... please don't.
I told you, tide charts are not fake news!
See Bob, I TOLD you sea levels were rising.
So then, what's your Tide story?
On the positive side if we have to go, we no longer have to look for a bathroom.
Low tide, high tide. You're the one who wanted to feel the water between your toes!
Global warming is real, but it doesn’t seem to be helping our relationship.
When the tide goes out, wave goodbye.
Still glad they drained the swamp?
Maybe there is something to the ice caps melting after all...
Honey, did someone forget to drain the swamp?
You know,  there just might be something to this “global warming” thing I’ve been reading about.
I told you we don't need both hats and an umbrella.
But President Trump says that global warming is NOT happening!
Believe in climate change now?
Damn global warming.
So this is Houston.

Pretty soon you won't need a bathing suit either.
Only frogs actually boil.  Right?
Wait until September, you said. The crowds will be gone, you said. The hurricanes only come in the summer, you said.
Well, the upside is that we no longer have to see Dershowitz sunbathing in the nude.
the ad DID say ocean view...
I find the affects of global warming to be a lot more relaxing that I thought they'd be.

I can only imagine that your whistle is wet.
So... if it gets up to our necks, we're outa here.
Well, yes, it is Everest.  But I still say global warming's a hoax.
Apparently 'Global Warming' doesn't believe in the 'Trickle Down Effect'.
Wasn't there a hotdog stand ten feet from here last year?
They said one day Pittsburgh would be beach front property...
You know John, I think I've had it upmto here.
I'd be more inclined to dismiss this as the effect of climate change if this weren't low tide.
Did you notice that new dam up the road?
So this is what you meant when you said we were in hot water with our landlord.
I've sent away for Ark plans.
Probably will only need half the sunscreen we brought.
I think our marriage is sinking, Mike.
Ahh Utah!!!
Something was different last summer. I just can't put my finger on it.
Don’t litter. It’s already mad.
At least we don't need to put sunscreen on our feet.
I hope this isn't low tide!
When's the tide going to lift your boat?
Next year let's take our vacation AFTER the monsoon season.
I didn't think it would rain this hard with the sun out.
We should have listened to Al Gore
I still think global warming is a bunch of hog wash.
Well, water is better than debt.
I should have married someone shorter than me.
What happens when our president misses the toilet:
This Chinese hoax gets more elaborate every year.
You think there might be something to this global warming thing after all?
A couple more iceburgs melt and the summer will be ruined!
I’m getting kind of chilly. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.
You wanted to try the global warming discount.
The Anderson’s forgot one important thing in testing whether a rising tide lifts all boats.
This is either the wrath of God or we did it to ourselves. Either way, the hotel is non-refundable.
Well, they were right about a nice view of the lake.
'Low tide isn't what it used to be.'

Global warming is still a myth.
I guess time and tide really do wait for no man.
I dunno Bob, maybe this "climate change" thing isn't just a fad.
Well, at least we don't have to worry where the bathroom is.
The pamphlet said a pool was included
There is no global warming, there is no global warming..
The ice caps are warmer than I thought they'd be.
Global warming is such a plus.  Look what it has done for us in Alaska.
And you still believe the 3% of climate scientists who say climate change is bogus and not caused by human beings....
Maybe we ought to sell our stake in our time share before word gets out that this is no longer beach FRONT property.
I thought the brochure said the cabana was "on the water" not "in" it.
Was that this year’s tide chart you looked at?
That reminds me, the sump pump in the basement is on the fritz again.
That was fast. So there goes Greenland, I guess.
Enjoy an affordable, romantic getaway at the Tide Inn.
So glad we got that underwater loan, Harry.

That had better be your foot on my side of the table.
It's a hoax."

No, Harold, high tide isn't a beer brand they were going to be selling at the beach this afternoon.
Move that hand, Edward. People can see us.
Are you sure this was our favorite spot?
There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads to ...misfortune.
I thought you said you checked the global warming forecast for today.
I think it felt cooler last summer.
The wading is the hardest part.
What was the name of that Blondie song?
This is the last time we accept free vacation for a time-share pitch.
Would you feel around for  the oars dear.
Sunbathing
Tell me again what a great deal you got on this boat.
Do you think they've grown up and gone off to college? Or should we wait a little longer?
Well, you always wanted an  ocean front property.

Greenhouse gases, I presume...
I told you to get that GPS checked before we left.
Last time I book a Climate Change Special.

Nothing better than feeling the sand between your toes
This immersive play seems too literal.
Won't need sunscreen on our legs today my love.
Low tides aren’t what they used to be.”
A hoax huh!

How'd the photographer get over there?
Is this global warming thing supposed to happen so quickly?
So that's what they meant by "on the house."

I told you we should have gotten the Prius. Damn rising sea levels.
I told you about Climate Change. Do you believe me now?
So this is a lakefront resort.
At least we're cooling off .
My followers are going to be so jealous.
Well, I guess you did say it was beach front property.
Make America Great Again policies have helped us stay so much cooler at the beach this summer.
I have a feeling I left something running at home.
Nah, it's just a high tide.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs...
Revenge is a dish best served wet.
Stop!  I told you that Gore was right, but noooo, you wouldn't listen.
Maybe there is something to it.
Perhaps we should reconsider the wet bar.
Sinkhole, shminkhole.
Rather than complain about global warming, be thankful that the 1% give the rest of us one day off a year.
Well, Harriet​, I warned you thatbeachfront​t property isn't what it used to be.
Next time, don't ask for a table with an unobstructed view of the water.
…yes, but moving might provoke a Constitutional crisis.
Maybe we should have declined the upgrade from beachfront.
I guess an umbrella is not a proper flotation device.
Now I can see why this riverboat cruise was so inexpensive.
Honey, I still think the beach is behind us.
At least Hurricane Lane distracted us from the Kilauea eruptions.
Global warming" has actually cooled this beach
Just how much hairspray did you use this morning?
On the plus side, we only use half as much sunscreen.
Either this is the tide coming in or we're in deep doo-do.
I’ve heard that everyone floats when the tide is in.
This lovely cruise you booked online is a tad too budget for me.
So...is our current situation objective evidence or just anecdotal evidence of Global Warming?
Look how long that bathroom line is.
Global warming? It's not even that hot out here!
You wanted a spot near the water
How on earth did you forget your trunks?
Is it coming in or going out?
Relax, we've got another hour before the tide comes back in.
And the little dog surrounded by all the flames was saying, "This is fine." I thought it was funny.
Actually, I prefered the view when this was the top of the house.
Personally, I've always been an iceberg's-half-frozen type of guy.
Is this what they meant by "high season"?
Please tell me when the tide goes out your moon will be covered this time.
So, do you think Global Warming is still a hoax?
Our beachfront home might be underwater, but we still have our rooftop deck.
I’d check the weather but my phone is wet.
Global warming's a myth," you said! "Beach-front property is a great investment," you said! Well, if the climate keeps changing, we'll soon be under water
Who said global warming wasn’t real
I forgot the sunscreen!
Melting of the Poles, really puts a damper on our summer holidays.
Why should our vacation be any different than our life at home? 'Merica!
Buy the beachfront property you said, and I was an idiot to agree with you!
Look on the bright side. Before global warming we couldn't go to the beach in September.
Well, you have to admit - the coal miners have made it easier to reach the beach...
I'm so glad we left the reclining chairs at home"
Because I know, all those spiders attacking that town was just fiction.
Ya still think climate change is a hoax...? On the bright side, at least you ditched that dumb MAGA cap!
don't open it, George--it's probably just another half-baked attack on your denials of climate change.
At least parking was free
Thank goodness L.L. Bean has an easygoing return policy.
What ever happened to the heat in our marriage? I guess tides change
If you’re gonna keep doing that you’re moving downstream.
This is why I prefer lakes, Nigel.
The Millers' yard is looking so brown and dry lately.
Did you bring the sunscreen?
Can you reach the cooler, I just finished my beer."
"We didn't bring one. Where'd you get the beer can?
I thought it said on the water...".
I can't believe you forgot the sunscreen.
Ed, I’m having doubts about us needing that new swimming pool.
I knew we forgot the Drano.
'The backyard is always changing' is the best you can come up with?
Well, Are you ready yet to admit I was right?
Your right, it is cooler in the water.  The added bonus is the beer floating by, please pass one to me.
Well, it's high tide and I guess they aren't going to get here.
I'm a beach is half empty kind of woman, George
I'll take my top off, but if this ends up in the news you're sleeping on the couch.
Travel guides are not keeping up with the impact of global warming.
If we stay for another hour then we will really beat the traffic."
Those dunes back there remind me of your hairy behind, George.
Just give it a few more minutes.  The hotel guy promised this would be drained soon.
Are you sure this umbrella will protect us from global warming?
You just aren’t the same anymore Jason, we’re history.
Are you sure global warming is a hoax
They told me that rainstorms can up suddenly but this is ridiculous.
Weialala leia, Wallala leialala
Is 'the beach receded' an acceptably naysaying explanation?
Did you pack your trunks?
Didn't I tell you that a tropical vacation in the monsoon season is a dumb idea?
Whatever it is stopped nibbling my toes, but it just made off with one of my flip-flops.
Seems a little humid today.
This is great…we don’t have to walk down to the water
January in Iceland, it'll be fun, you said
Millennials retiring in Florida.
Look at the bright side,we are finally ocean front.
You said you wanted an immersive experience.
Out of the sun, floating koozie and the best part... don't have to get out to find the bathroom.
He said I'm a sea-level executive that never rises to the top.
It’s different out here after Labor Day.
Well Stephen...?   I guess this proves your theory on,"Lake Tides", needs a bit more work.
I agree. The conditions on this beach change when a big boat passes by.
Henry, can you check on the children? They've gone quiet.
I hope this is high tide.
Welcome to Anthropocene State Park
Surf's up!
'...Fluffy?'
Well, this makes me want to think about cancelling our Farmers' Almanac subscription.
Is that your toes I feel, hun?”
“Nope...
Perhaps a little more research next time!
Not going to need that bathroom break after all.
Is the kid still playing in the sand next to you?
Something's jaws have my foot, darling.
I didn't think global warming was arriving before Labor Day"
Next time let's take the boat tour.
Happy Anniversary.
And just think--this is low tide.
Chevy, tick. Levy, tick. It just makes no sense.
A Vanderberry NEVER cedes property.
Seafood, surf, and turf, come Hell or high water.
Ok, I think we can finally give up our view...
We should have taken the last plane out.
What else could go wrong. Sharks?
Totally worth it for the credit card points.
Scientists are calling it re-evolution. Our species is heading back to whence we came”.
Wait, do we have children?
You and I are going to have to start planning separate vacations.
At least we're spending less on sunscreen.
Dear, I think our mortgage is underwater.
Do you think the cabana boy will be back soon?
Honey, is this Miami? I don’t see any Cubans.
That felt like a seal, not a shark.......
OK — I’ll agree this has nothing to do with global warming if you agree to move to higher ground.
The bugs are beginning to bother me.
FLORIDA -- "Where concealed carry meets global warming!"
Well Howard, there’s no doubt about our sex life now. We’re both in DENIAL!
"Mr. Budget Conscious books a water view. Fine. He gets a bargain, he says. But does he check the tides? He does not.
OK, forget global warming. If we leave, I'll make that chicken you like.
Now we know why this spot was empty.
On the plus side, the water has gotten a lot warmer
Fancy a swim?
If the sunburn doesn't get you, the sharks will.
I have this sinking feeling that summer is almost over.
I said it before, and I'll say it again: "I wanted to go to the mountains!"
Oh Gee,  What happened?  When did we get in the water?
Our old spot you said. Remember the view of the beach you said. It'll be romantic you said.
...and the big fool said to push on.
Are we swimming?
Didn’t you tell me climate change was BS?
Did you bring the soap?
On the bright side, we're saving 50% on sunscreen.
Maybe we should go in before it gets too globally warm!
Look, this salt water is damaging our marriage and my sandals.
Pass the water, dear.
Don’t worry Dear, last week was “shark week.”
OK, so it's the moon, but how much longer do we wait?
What’s the water resistant time on our sunscreen?
I thought global warming would be more fun.
The Chinese must be going after American jobs again.
Yes, it's an opportunity to play hidden footsie, but let's concentrate on saving our lives.
Evidently, the tide agrees with me about your beach nudity.
Even if the water is this high because of global warming, it is pleasantly cool.
I told you this vacation was too expensive. Now we’re under water.
I thought global warming would be a drier heat.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
What’s with these guys, predicting we had until the end of the century!
Greeting from our vacation. Save us. We are drowning in boredom.
I still think we should have brought the floaties.
Next time, let's try to come during low tide.
That's not the kind of warming I expected...
Before climate change, we had a patio near the water and could enjoy one or the other. Now we can enjoy our patio and the water at the same time.
If I told you once, I've told you a thousand times. It's boats, Frank, boats. A rising tide lifts all boats.
I thought you said "High Time" not  "High Tide" to come here...
I know we're underwater, Dear!
It's not what I expected from a trip to Greenland.
Miami Beach is changing before our eyes!
Global warming?  Climate change?  Rising sea levels?  Don't be ridiculous!
I warned you if the deal appears too good to be true, it is
Damn dam.
Well, I guess it's true.
Oceans rise, empires fall.
Next time, you read the tide chart.
I'm worried about my tan lines!
‘Retire to Florida’, you said. Tell me again why not Arizona?
When should we start giving little Johny swimming lessons?
Well, at least our legs won’t burn!
Beachfront property really lost its cache since global warming.
One man’s evacuation is another man’s vacation.
So much for the swamp getting drained.
I suppose we should enjoy Global Warming while we can.
I told you to check the weather
This is refreshing.
Then why is the water so cold, Bob
How do you feel about climate change now, Dear?
Maybe we should've listened to Al Gore.
I knew this global warming thing would catch up with us.
It's only half-full? You and your cockeyed optimism!
Sink or Swim
I know we shouldn't have moved to Miami Beach.
I left my water socks in the car
Love our roof deck.
I think I'm starting to believe there's something to that "Global Warming" thing.
At the rate this water's rising we'll at least both be dead long before Bannon hits the stage and completely kills our reputation.
It's just a very high tide, not global warming.  
Hannity said so, and I believe him.
But no, you didn't want to pack the sandbags.
I think the tide just rolled in.
Did you shut off the stove before we left?
CAN YOU SWIM
Stay on your side of the bed tonight.
Ebb tide my ass.
We are so underwater with bills.
First, it's global warming, then it's climate change. I wonder what the next fad will be.
Don't even say, "I told you so!"
With a bit more global warming I'll be able to take off my suit, also.
I didn’t think the permafrost would melt on our vacation.
We now have waterfront property thanks to Global Warming
I understand global warming and rising sea levels.  I just thought we had more time.
But his tweet stated that global warming and increasing ocean levels is a myth!
Honey, it could be worse, global cooling would have us waist deep in ice.
I wish the planet would stop making such a fuss. It's ruining my vacation.
Doomsday preppers
Well Honey it looks like we're finally all washed up.
The water level is actually much lower than historic indicators.
I told you to go with the tide, Canute.
This time, your Jimmy Buffet idolization has gone too far.
I just don't think sitting here all day like this helps justify pulling out of the climate change agreements
At least the sunblock was water resistant.
Well, don't we look like a pair of cnuts.
You had to have this timeshare
You had to pay only $15
You had to have a water view
Well, here we are
Happy now?
Have you read anything about global warming lately?
Not one more word about frogs and blenders.
I'm happy as a clam. How 'bout you?
Is it "Tide's up" or Surf's up"?
Should we review which one's "ebb" and which one's "flow?"
C’mon, hell!
I suppose they may have been right about that climate change thing.
So, who wanted to take a cheap beach vacation at the Bay of Fundy?
Climate warming is not so bad after all. They said we would adjust.
Our rooftop terrace is not as hot as I remembered it being.
He's so wise!  He has explained that the ocean is NOT rising, the land is just sinking!  Everywhere.
How's cooling off from global warming working for you?
Clearly our real estate investments are underwater.
I thought Global Warming was Fake News!
Darling, are we COOL ?
Put one in the win column for global warming.
Reservations were paid in advance
Mar-a-Lago is next
Yes, and I'm gonna be your number one.
we live in a wade your ground state!
Destination: North Pole 2050
Regarding time and tide...I think we’ve made our point
I hope that’s a little global warming I’m feeling right now.
So…. No clambake tonight…. This global warming thing is starting to annoy me.
I prefer to think of it as half empty.
On the other hand, we'll have beach-front property in no time.
How about 'Make America Cool Again'?
Sorry, but I planned this trip; the tide will not dictate our vacation.
So I guess this is absolute waterfront.
Who knows what the tide could bring?
I think we have to find a new travel agent.
What's taking that waiter, Noah, so long?
Are you sure this rental isn't on a septic system?
I think the humidity is bad today.
Just wait, in three hours we'll have the best spot on the beach.
Fuck Stephen Bannon and all those who enable him.
Have you seen Fifi?
I told you I couldn't hold it.
I told you, no matter where we go, I just can't forget about our mortgage situation.
It's actually a bit of a relief.  I thought we were behind on our mortgage.
George, now are you happy with your big gas-eating car?
...I was looking  for liquidity , not a rising liquid situation .
This was not what I expected when you said the AirBNB has access to the ocean.
Let's see. You said climate change was fake news?
Maybe climate change is a blessing.
I guess this really is the
Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.”
Did you remember to turn off the sprinkler before we left?
I guess we can’t exxonerate those climate change deniers after all.
I hope I used enough sunblock.
I don't know what to say... I'm just flooded with emotions.
You've left the tap running again!
This reminds me of our first honeymoon.
Whaddya think of my poker face now?
Trust me, at low tide we can sell this spot for a mint.
It beats using that awful Porta Potty.
Next high tide won’t be for another 12 hours, so you’d better pee now
Henry, call the plumber.
On top of that, I forgot to unplug the iron before we left.
Are you sure you should be on a break, Noah?
The tide comes farther up the beach than I remember.
Global warming? How? I feel so refreshed!
Honey, whatever happened to “draining the swamp”
I may be willing to give up our spot now.
I thought this was supposed to happen in the Maldives first.
I realize we're without a paddle, but what you even do with one it you had it?
So, Ivanka or Kanye 2036?
Do you think Trump will ever make Mar a Lago great again?
The desert is nice and all, butnext year let's go to the beach.
This better be rising sea levels and not overflowing porta-potties.
You could've put that up before it rained.
I don’t think flooding qualifies usas owners of beach front property
What eroding shoreline?
Is this what the mortgage company meant when they said  we were underwater?"
Well the King Canute gambit doesn’t work. Let’s try the Moses method and scram.
We plan to retire in Florida come hell or high water.
I told you putting the beach umbrella in concrete was a great bad idea.
I'm tired of waiting for Godot or life raft. Please take off the Google glasses and let's go.
Rising ocean levels may be fake news, but this sure feels like real water!
Surf's up.  Bladder control not required.
I’ve come around - global warming is real.
The truth, Bill - are you writing anonymous op-eds again?
Tomorrow don’t forget to check the time for high tide.
Got a dry towel?
We never do anything exciting any more.
You turn off the water.
Well, I guess it's still better than being flooded with emails
Maybe it's just outdated tide charts.
Did they say it was high tide today? I don't remember.
Colin, I know what you just did”
Tell me again about how global warming is fake news.
Is this your idea of poolside?
I feel like a piña colada.
I don't think we need these hats
When did peeing in a can become the thing that defines you?
I told you that whole Ice Bucket Challenge fad wouldn't end well.
If this is climate change, I want my money back.
Well, you know what they say? Location, location, location.
Well, at least the flight was cheap.
Is it possible that global warming is self-correcting?
I was hoping warmer, not wetter.
You don't think we got ourselves in over our heads, do you?
Something's fishy here.
Don, do you fully understand the gravity of this situation?
Want to get divorced again?
Do you think we're starting to get carried away with our dedication to beach days?
Honey, are you sure climate change is a hoax?
Honey, I think we should review our long term-goals.
'Dear, I think snakes can also swim.'
I am not enjoying this.
Let's buy this house now" you said.  "They're not making any more waterfront.
Well this is it, Katrina.
If the president says there is no global warming then there is no global warming
It's not sea level rise until it's up to our necks.
All I’m saying is you better be wearing those trunks when the tide goes out.
I told you that was Jim Cantori at our hotel
Global warming really has us up to our necks, doesn’t it?
Now is not the time to admit you can't swim.
Well this went swimmingly.
When Betty and Bob are together conversation never dries up.
Don't worry, you said. 
Flashflood Valley is just a marketing name, you said.
I hope you didn't bring the Gator Ade
Is the tide half high or half low?
That's better, now the the water has receded a bit.
When is high tide?
When I said let's go to the beach, I thought you said "Its high time", not "high tide".
I'm not going to tan evenly!
This certainly takes the fun out of the Bay of Fundy.
The tides change very quickly after a tsunami.
Après nous... well, nothing.
I don't know if it's because we're blind but did we pick a good spot ?
The kids will be fine, it's your mother I worry about
How much did they soak you for the chairs and umbrella?
Well, this umbrella sucks.
Quick, get the lifechairs.
Honey, what was the name of that travel agent who said he could save you a bundle?
We are sitting in water.
Is that you?
What do you mean, "look at the bright side...?"
You say the dam burst; I say the river rose. Can't we just agree to disagree?
Gee, global warming is coming faster than I thought!
I might have made a little too much potato salad.
I said, tide's coming in.
High tide, low tide, who knew darling...
It’s not the same.  I still want a hot-tub.
so the glass really is half full
Probably didn't need sunblock on my legs!
Buford, I think this is called high tide.
And I used to not believe in global warming....
It's high tide you admit you were wrong.
I told ya. Nebraska was just a bit to close to the ocean.  Global warming screwed us again.
Still think global warming is a hoax, Frank?
I think people are laughing at my hat.
We're still trespassing.
Thank the Donald! 
Our house was a mile from the ocean before the coal industry took over the EPA.  
Finally, we have beach front property.
Talk?  To who?
I told you the bold type meant high tides, not low tides.
Not again, this is draining.”
Well, so much for a quick dip.
You said the water here was only knee deep and it's still low tide

The forecast was right. It's 50% humidity.
I told you Al Gore made a better Vice President than real estate salesman.
Thanks a lot, Al Gore.
So tell me again how climate change science remains an open question?
I don't remember sea level being this high when we came here on our honeymoon.
Welcome to Nantucket.
I didn't think it would happen so fast
I still think Global Warming is just a liberal lie.
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted a pool.
Don't drain the swamp now,I forgot my shorts !
Thank God for global warming. The water's rising, but at least it's no longer cold.
I’m not convinced about global warming. You?
It's high tide Harry. Shut up already about global warming and find the wine bottle.
The tide came in pretty fast, didn't it?
Next year let’s just go to the Matterhorn.
If I knew, I wouldn't have done so many ab reps.
I told you I didn't need to put sunscreen on my feet.
On further reflection, perhaps global warming is a thing.
Hi Mom. How are you? Yeah, the date went great. But she won't text me back. No, we didn't almost drown. Stop exaggerating.
We should sell this property now, while the impact of climate change is balanced between unbearable heat and cool rising water.
Even though this is so nice we should get back to the TV ASAP we might be missing some new news about Trump, we've been here over and hour already.
You still do not believe in climate change!
Craig, I want a divorce.
So this is what DiCaprio was talking about...
Donald ,I think we should move inland.
Actually, Arizona's looking good right now...
I have a sinking feeling about this free vacation you signed us up for...
I am beginning to think that global warming is not fake news after all.
Now you’ve had your beer free flow, where’s my tanning salon?
This is no day at the beach.
So Global Warming isn't a hoax... Joke's on us I guess.
I got a great deal on this trip. Found it in a flash flood sale.
You know...climate change really isn’t all that bad.
I doubt Amazon would exchange sunglasses for goggles.
When it rains, it pours.
I really thought it would be Hell that would come
Hello from Peg and Ned 
enjoying our Beach-less 
Oceanfront Hotel.
Global Warming sure came in fast.
Looks like we received an instant message.
I think our signal fire was too close to the shore.
If  you had  worn your shorts, we wouldn’t need to be hiding from our guests.
The fine print said what about Beach Front Property?
Looks like we came prepared
Next vacation, let's find a beach that actually allows public access.
I didn’t mean the EXACT spot we met.”
This is why I hate it you denying climate change.
Maybe I'd rather you leave me high and dry.
Something has changed at this beach!
You say fossil fuels. I say fat women in bikinis.
I remember when this was the piedmont.
No Chris! The rest of the family decided not to come this time.
Timeshares have really gone to the pits.
Stubbornness does not make you stronger than the storm.
Next time we opt for a staymersion.
- Is it time to call for help Sweetheart?
- No darling I have faith. God will save us.
Sharks depend on surprise in the shallows. That umbrella worked on me.
I  said  check the TIDE tables, not the side.
Next year lets don't do the off season.
Life's a beach until global warming!
Winter in Antarctica
The coupon was good for one complimentary shark watch.
Well!  I certainly could easily have  packed more bathing suits had I known!
Well, We're in hot water now!"
"Yeah, sorry I couldn't find the restrooms
I thought umbrellas were supposed to keep you dry not wet.
I told you the ice would melt.
I have a sinking feeling.
We prefer water than sand between our toes, anyway.
They did advertise beachfront property.
Season's tidings from Florida!
Well, they did advertise waterfront.
I thought you said WaterBnB was just a clever play on words, Larry.
Don't panic, I am sure the NOAA tide predictions are correct.
This global warming thing is happening faster than I thought.
Is that you, Dave?
When did you say high tide was?
Let's take a selfie and send it to all our friends in California.
Hey, cut that out!
He said he would hire only the best people.
I have every intention of asking him difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative discussion.
Yes, it is wetter than it used to be.
Getting in past your naval is the hard part.
You were serious about our finances putting us under water!
As always, Steve Bannon put it best: "The swamp is a business model. It's a successful business model."
Still don't believe in global warming?
I told you Al, This is why we should have bought a hybrid .
Rising tide!
Well  we need a lift  !
Donald, will you please stop playing footsie with me?”
You didn't mention it's a self-serve all-you-can-eat sushi bar
Harold, I tried to tell you the tide wouldn’t just “go around us”
Bill!!!  I don’t care if the dam broke, use the hotel washroom.
It used to be our dining room.
I've heard some call it cooling now.
Any minute now, they’re going to drain this swamp.
Sure, rising sea levels are becoming a hassle, but we're in Denver for keeps.
This was bound to happen with elevated sea levels.
You're idea of a stay-cation doesn't sound so bad now.
We should move to the other tide.
I'm a tiny bit worried about this bucket list of yours.
So, honey, now, at long last, will you get finally rid of your gas guzzling SUV?
'"Now they're calling it 'Global Sinking'."
I think we should see other climates.
Your dedication to climate change denial has finally gone too far.
'I think I left the oven on.'
It's just about time to move the Florida beach getaway to Orlando.
So, you still think climate change is fake?
In those days it was not only crowded, it was actually a beach.
Ralph, I felt another warm spot.
So why do you think they keep going on about Global Warming?
Look on the bright side - the seagulls won't be able to steal our sandwiches now.
Look at the bright side, thanks to global warming, we now own beachfront in Yuma AZ!
When they said waterfront property I assumed they meant the dry side of the waterfront.
Well, they said New York would be underwater...
Well honey, you got your cruise...
I thought you checked the tide tables.
And this is low tide.
We are going to have to do more about climate change than reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
Buried treasure... sunken treasure... What’s the difference, at this point?
It's just not the same when you piss on me in the water.
At least we're not hot and these floodwaters hide our chubby parts!
I'm telling you, global warming is just a massive hoax, perpetrated by Big Solar and the Chinese.
The travel agent didn't warn me about global warming.
Got another beer, dear?
(sigh) Global warming.
Apparently this is low tide now?
I love global warming.
Climate denial ain't just your mama's crocodile luggage in the flow.
We should have booked this BEFORE global warming.
I now have my backstory for inventing the telescoping beach chair.
Global warming’s a bitch, huh?
Be Positive,the Oceans are rising but it is warmer.
Yes, this is warm for Anchorage in December.
Perhaps there is something to this global warming thing.
I don’t care what 45’s supporters think. Global warming IS real.
Sweat.  MAGA!  Yes.  It's sweat.
Waterworld the Directors Cut, now featuring previously unreleased crappy flashback scenes.
I suppose the ocean front infinity pool did get a bit larger...
Trump's gonna have to raise the tariffs on importing ice from Antarctica!
Tides, schmides! I paid $7 bucks to rent this umbrella for the day.
Let's go inland next season.
I thought the bank meant our mortgage!
You're the one who said there is no global warming.
Welcome to Arizona. I'd like you to meet my husband,...the "Climate Change Denier".
The Hamptons are not what they used to be after climate change.
You can't beat this part of the beach, Carl. We're always cool, and I don't have to shave my legs.
Did you see that rogue, wave at me
If this is from ice melt, why’s there a warm spot?
When we bought the timeshare, it seemed like a good long range retirement investment."
Yes, but you get the best spots at high tide.
If it touches my nipples we vacation in Maine next year.
I think we all miss Florida, but think about how much gas we're saving by bringing the beach to us.
Of course this is how you sunbathe
Something is digging sunscreen.
Au naturel really rings my bell.
Next year let's rent a place with a third story roof-top deck
I still think climate change is a bunch of bull.
You were right that it’s secluded.
Harold, I think it's time you quit your job as a climate-change denier.
So you meant 'drift away' literally, Stanley?
This is the NEW Florida vacation?
My neighbor said the wave was going to be red.
What's it like when the tide comes in?
I can't see your butt.
I don't get why this new rooftop is so popular.
I knew we shouldn't have trusted those clouds.
Fine. We’ll get a rowboat next time.
Yeah right, a half bath with running water and a roof over our heads, some honeymoon hotel  this is!
Never mind, I think I know when the tide's coming in.
Have you noticed the morning dew has been getting heavier lately?
American Pathetic.
Don't believe everything you hear. The polar bears are just fine.
Damn global warming. Best untie the dog.
Do you feel something pinching your toes?...oh...your beer is floating away.
You said he would drain the swamp.
Yes...but the brochure did mention warmer than normal temperatures this time of year.
I guess beer was the better choice.
When its 2050 and you still refuse to let anyone else get that spot on the beach that has been yours since 2020.
I thought it was "Time and Todd wait for no man."
I pleaded with you not to take out a ten-year lease on an ocean front property--but, no, you wouldn't listen to me.
Monsoon season seemed like fun in the brochure. Enjoy sweetheart.
I told you we should have built our patio deck higher.
Harry, I told you we should have bought that flood insurance.
My damn iphone keeps updating the time zone automatically.
Clive, I think I left the oven on.
So, is this tide half ebb, or half flood?
No, you said you'd move the blanket before high tide came in.
Keep searching with your toes. There must be a plug somewhere.
You’re weeing aren’t you.
Was there any fine print when you signed us up for this "Underwater Adventure", Frank?
Tell me again, what's so terrible about global warming?
Summer on Greenland.
Had to be Mar a Lago?
I didn't think to take you literally when you said we will be vacationing in the Everglades.
I told you this umbrella sucks.
George, are you playing footse with me?
Are you sure that this because of global warming and not just from high tide?
Is that your foot or something I shouldn’t worry about.
Those hairy asses behind us are starting to look more appealing.
I hate soggy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
I think climate change is real, no matter what he says.
When you said you were underwater on your home loan, I didn't realize you were speaking literally.
Are you absolutely sure it's low tide?
Honey, I just wet my pants.
I'm not sure the Global Warming discount is all it's cracked up to be.
No need to worry--it's jut fake news.
Doesn't the hotel have a pool?
We'll evolve sooner or later.
We’re kind of deep in this together now.
Yes, you should re-apply sunscreen if the earth is melting.
And now we rest and relax?
I THINK I'LL TAKE A DIP.
Explain to me again about the sunspots, Howard.
Well, the ad did say this would be a “full-immersion” experience.
Just feels different from when we bought the property.
I'm not saying it's not because of the sea level rising, I'm just saying we could have tested it by using a rod or something instead of just sitting here for the past 10 years.
I warned you about global warming- great ocean front buy!
Don't worry, our relationship won't go underwater.
So much for climate change denial.
You see, even the sea is half empty with you, Steven.
In Miami, the water comes to you!
Great spot, Jerry.
'You're peeing in the water, aren't you'
I guess your right, this is good practice for global warming.
Do you see the beach half full or half empty?
Aaah. The pause that refreshes...
Don't tell me you dropped the sunscreen again!
Seems different from our first honeymoon.
So it’s not a total loss you forgot to bring the sun tan lotion
The E.P.A. report I read didn't mention this phenomenon.
Told ya! Denver would be beach front because of global warming. But no, you insisted on Colorado Springs...
I'm starting to think there's something to that stuff about beach erosion.
Still a denier?
We should have left the towels in the car.
When you said, "we'll be close to the water," this wasn't what I had in mind.
Sea level rise? Who knew?
Do you think the tide's coming in?
I guess the umbrella didn’t work
Tap the seal, dear?
I thought Global Warming would take longer!
Looks like the tide is going out.
Jane and Bob experience the new “sea to table” movement
Did you bring the waterproof sunblock?
Global warming is a hoax. Global warming is a hoax. Global warming is a...Glub glub glub...
Global warming, ice shelf melting and sunscreen sales: who would have thought?
Apparently beach erosion is moving more rapidly than anyone expected.
When did you say climate change was ending?
Yes, it is refreshing, but so was the drink I didn't finish.
I think my thirst has been quenched...definitely!
"Seaicied Pact"
Buy a time share they said, global warming is a hoax they said"
See honey, I told you one day we’d explore the seven seas together. I never said it be on a boat.
This close enough to the water for ya, Stan?
So much for those “climate change will be gradual” theories.
We should've listened to Bill McKibben.
Who thought global warming could be so cooling.


Ken Franklin,   New York, N.Y.
Is this sea level rise a hoax too, Mr. Scientist?
Is water wet?
Water is the last thing a fish would notice.
It's not as warm as they said it would be.
I hear the Tarpon are biting today.
I think we should negotiate a time-share that isn't dependent on the full moon.
Is your Cousin Carl still in the Coast Guard?
Hot enough for you?
And THEN you said, “Why go to Hawaii when the beautiful  Mississippi Delta is so much closer?”
Our low tide days are over....
The sunscreen; did you buy the waterproof kind?
The umbrellla is too small for your pinocolada
I don't remember this beach being so wet ten years ago.
Are you warming up to it not being a hoax now?
On the positive side, feel free to pee at any time.
I wonder why the beach is so empty today.
I think the word you're looking for is eerie...
It’s a good thing we left these chairs on the roof deck.
Honey, you disregarded the GPS’s directions and the Almanac’s high tide warnings. It’s time for you to show your total freedom by neglecting the rip tide alerts.
This isn't quite how I expected our Hawaiian vacation to be.
I like our underwater vacation, Larry.
Baby, it's definitely not better down where it's wetter
According to the schedule this IS low tide.
Are you sure that the article you read said that sea level rise wouldn't occur until the 22nd century?"

OR

"It was either this or stay with my parents for a week!
The tide tables were wrong again.
Once high tide ends, we’ll look for your phone - should end up with a good picture.
This is not the cruise I was expecting.
I guess the tide chart said A.M.
The Realtor did say this was beach front property!
The asphalt burns, Jonathan! It's burning my skin! But this is what we deserve, Jonathan. This is what God wants from our corporeal forms. Let us rejoice in anguish!
Don't worry, your sunscreen is waterproof...and shark-repellent.
I told you we shouldn't have set up at low tide.
Honey.... This wasn't in the brochure.
when you whant too cool off in the water and stay in the shade so you don't get tand.
Hey look you can see Antarctica, we're swimming in it
I thought Madison was supposed to be great this time of year.
It wasn't like this last year.
I certainly hope those are your toes tickling my feet...
I'd like a martini, extra dry.
'Our property values will increase if sea levels rise'  - you said.
I'd  like a bit more sand.
Yes, this is the NEW low tide.
That's really too bad that your stocks are underwater
And how will global warming affect me?
That better be your foot
No dear. It's not fair to blame our laundry detergent.
This was an excellent idea of yours. DearHeart,  to put us in the river to keep us cool today.I know I never would have thought of it.
Can you reach the soda cooler? I need a drink.
This way we need a lot less sunblock.
This place is notorious for watering down drinks.
So, no matter what 45 says, warming is real!
The president said the glaciers wouldn't melt today!
Dear, I know this is our favorite spot - but I think global warming caught up with us.
Maybe something good can be said about global warming
When you said our portfolio was "under water"  I had no idea it was this bad.
I know, I know. All those fools stuck in traffic.
You did turn off the hose?
You know Senator honey, you might just want to rethink your position on all that global warming bull-tweedy.
Sea levels are projected to rise how high by 2050?
Little known fact... high water is hell!
Weren't you supposed to turn off the water?
This looks nothing like the Corona ad I clicked on.
Honey, can you pass me my towel?
I hate to say I told you so, Eddie, but I did say we should bring straws, didn’t I?
Honey, climate change's a hoax.  You know that, right?
I'm a lake half-full kind of guy.
If only we had known about global warming before we bought the timeshare.
Excuse me sir, can you change our table? It’s bit wobbly.
Those global warming fearmongers just don't understand that computer models just aren't capable of making accurate predictions of what's going to happen 100 years from now.
John, please let go of my hand...
Leeches Turks and Caicos
It’s high tide we took a dip in the ocean this summer.
Our Smoky Mountains vacations haven’t been the same since climate change.
Global Warming I've heard about ... but Global WETTING?
Don't be silly! This is just a minor surge not global change!
See Fran, I told you those climate alarmists were wrong! They said sea level was going to rise 10 feet, this is 5 feet at best."
Fran: "Hon, it's low tide.
You told me our mortgage is under water, not the property.
What drought?
I still say they have a long way to go to prove global warming is real"
Where did you read that there’s  no such thing as global warming.
Perhaps global warming is the cause of this. However, I still think it is the tide!
The water table is sinking!
I swore the scientists said sea levels wouldn’t rise until next Tuesday.
Yep, you left the water on.
I knew this beachfront timeshare was a bad idea.
Damn! rising sea again. I wish this global warming thing would be over.
You forgot to turn off the sprinklers, again?
No, California's not sinking. It's spill-over from the DC swamp.
Told you Hampton Bays wasn't the Hamptons
I'd say high tide does come in rather quickly.....
Don't tell me global warming has something to do with this.
Tide tables? No, I forgot them.
Low tide at Club Climate Change
"If we were on Cape Cod, you'd be eaten by now."
I thought global warming just meant hotter weather
I like not having to flush!
No, Herbie. A rising tide does not lift all marriages.
they did say that climate change is here...but not so close.
I still say climate change is a hoax.
Let’s have the galley send up some cocktails.
I told you not to piss off the maitre de
So much for that book on global warming.
So, whoever goes to the shore first is chicken, right?
Forget the sunscreen and go get the snorkels.
I knew quicksand was going to be a problem when I grew up.
It's lucky I taught you the Dead Man's Float
I’m so glad they didn’t drain the swamp before our vacation. It’s quite nice this time of year.
Climate change will be a boon, you said. Ohio will have oceanfront views, you said.
Whadya know, I guess global warming is real.
Just two more years and the kids will stop asking for a pool.
Who's going to win George, you or the tide?
Did you just take a leak or is that more evidence of global warming?
Is he giving us the finger or asking for help?
We are not moving until the Smiths move!
When do you think they'll be coming by with our drinks?
Ya know, I’m just about up to my neck with all this news about global warming!
Things are never quite like what they put in the brochure.
Maybe God got misquoted.  I feel a Second Flood coming on.
Sure glad we built this patio on the roof of the house instead of the back yard, all those years ago!
Whoever thought we would enjoy living in New York City.
Let's stay another twenty years. I'd like to get completely submerged.
If it's global warming then why is the water so cold?
We always do everything half way!



."
Not exactly my idea of  vacationing in the Land Down Under.
Quicksand's kinda slow when you think about it.
That's the last time we book our vacation with Ark Travel
I guess we just have to admit it , climate change is real .
See Steve, I told you we should have moved our chairs back
I drank your sandwich.
I wanted to drown in the sun!
Still denying climate science, Harvey?
I think we could have gotten better seas for the water polo match.
Nothing like a game of high tide chicken to establish spousal dominance.
Can you see Billy swimming from here?
What time did you say was high tide?
It's about high tide that we left.
It's important we keep returning to our favorite spot.
Maybe one of the "beloved" has seen the light . . . and put a note in a beer can . . .
Did you say tomorrow we're scheduled to go scuba diving?
I believed you that climate is fake news.... but fake water??
Well, look at the bright side. Another 10 years from now we'll have beachfront property.
....And I thought 'Pat Conroy' was just a clever username for your online dating profile.
Ok, now I've had it. Maybe there is something to this global warming hype.
I didn't know this place was still underwater from 2008.
Stop blaming climate change Harry and just put your hands where I can see them, please?
They told us this beach was built on fill & the earthquake would liquefy it.
See I told you, I could get a fish pedicure and be at the beach at the same time.
What a day!
Doesn't feel like global warming to me...
This Oculus Go’s the real deal.
Can you learn to swim in ten minutes?
Are you globes warming?
These new-fangled umbrellas don’t hold in the water like they’re supposed to.
I disagree, Mildred. I think it's quite clear you do love Speedos and our marriage is a lie. He doesn't even have a Costco card, I can tell.
Damn it,even my beer floated away.
I guess the glaciers are melting.
Do you still think passing gas is funny?
I think this is their off season.
So would you say 'the beach is half full', Elmer?
I knew sea level rise was accelerating but, damn!
Well, Albert, what fresh hell is this?
You sure you turned the oven off.
Can't get enough of this beach.
Guess that's what "chance of light rain" looks like.
The itinerary clearly stated that Underwater Adventures is tomorrow!
Life's a beach!
Was this a sand beach or a pebble one?
I envisioned some Long Island tea...not sea.
The water feels cool so in can't be global warming.
This is why you don’t let the kids bury you in sand.
You said that song 'Ocean Front Property in Arizona' was made up.
You sure this was where we lost our virginity?
How many kids do you think have peed in this?
I was swamped with work when I left the office, so why did we come here?
I don't want to argue about global warming again, but if I see a dorsal fin I'm gone.
Do I still seem like a complete idiot for tying that anchor  around  your waist in case of a flash hurricane ?!
I think I left the tub running!
High-tide, low-tide, We're On Vacation !
The forecast said the rain wouldn't start 'til four.
He didn't drain the swamp, did he.
When's the last time you've seen our investments?
Okay, what just happened to the beach?
I used to love high tide.
Let's start chasing waterfalls.
Sea level rise or not, this has been our spot for years!
A lot of men wear Speedos here, this is ridiculous!
Do you get the feeling someone is staring at us?
Hi, 2018? 2035 here. About Florida...
You really need to workout more.
Wait, does total immersion work randomly, or is there a way I can pick French?
How long was I daydreaming?
Now I understand why the timeshare salesman was so opinionated on climate change...
Next time, wear a diaper
Are you still a global warming sceptic?
No, it's your turn to switch off the sprinkler system.
Fine, you were right about swim lessons for the kids.
It was a dam built by those short sighted Democrats in the 50s.
Shocker. Ted throws in the towels.
Honey, did you remember to unbury Uncle George?
Didn't they say this wouldn't happen until 2025?
- My book, is wet.
- My beer, gone.
So you went for the cheap seats again, Harold.
When I said we could use a little global warming on our summer vacation, this is not what I meant.
Go ahead, everyone steps on me on their way to the top around here.
Gordon. What do you need? No, Gordon!
Can you please put your swimming trunks on?
Well, global warming does have its up-side. It's hotter than hell, but it's easier to stay cool at the beach - what's left of it.
Didn't think global warming would come so soon
Beach front property my ass
I feel our vacation is being watered down.
I love this beach at low tide.
Beach Blanket Warming
Did you feel some water there for a second?
I read somewhere that floating is very therapeutic.
And you thought it was 1972
Phh. Global warming. No way.
I don't see how this will help us prepare for global warming.
Who says climate change isn't a thing?
Ocean front property... right, Harry?
I now understand the meaning of cheap waterfront property
I guess global warming and sea level rise is happening faster than we thought
Are you sure it isn't high tide?
I guess we’re early
Are you sure this is where we spent our honeymoon?
I told you we should have booked that glacier tour earlier.
Fun fact: Did you know that sharks can attack in less than 3 feet of water?
For the record, your "Internal Compass" stinks.
Are you sure you turned the water off in the condo?
I told you to bring a towel.
So you studied the tide charts?
We should make plans to go somewhere else next year.
let's live it up you said! Let's let a beach front property you said!
This vacation has us up to our ears in wet.
Six beers and not one bathroom break?
It's not private if we stay below the high tide mark.
Susan said the piranhas would bite harder.
Let's have fun in the sun", you said
I thought the travel guide said waterFRONT...
Did you renew our flood insurance last month?
The incoming tide will solve all of our problems.
I think I just wet my pants ...
slowsand!
This my dear is called Global Warming
I'm so glad we don't have children.
Ah yes, I guess global warming is becoming a wee bit of an issue...
We're not leaving until we get our deposit back.
I don't feel anything yet, do you?
This is what we get for booking ‘off-season.’”

[steve markuson, oneonta,new york]
I never wanted children.
If a waiter shows up, order me a gin and tonic.
So are you a glass is half full or glass is half empty sort of guy?
Are you getting ready for the whistle part when the tide rolls away?
I knew there was a catch to that economy clase ticket
Are you having a good time, Harold?" 
"Yes, I am having a good time, Marge.
Is that you or a minnow?
I think my foot just grazed Jimmy Hoffa
Feeling immersed yet?
Please tell me you're not urinating.
Global sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades. In 2014, global sea level was 2.6 inches above the 1993 average. Sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year.
Hate to admit it, but seems Global Warming is for real after all!
Climate change!!  This is exactly where we sat on our honeymoon!
The tide is coming in.
It is much nicer when the tide goes out.
According to the fake news, this was just a puddle when we were in high school.
The cabana boy is not a strong swimmer.
WIFE: "I think we should move back."
HUSBAND: The tide's goin' out now, so what's the rush?
WIFE: "That boat nearly hit us!"
I still don't believe it Marie. I mean, How can melting ice cause water levels to rise?" 
"Seriously? Right now?
Next time, just wear a swimsuit.
Nonsense--you wouldn't believe how much snow we had on our Vermont chalet last winter!
Don't be so stilted, they said...
I said, let’s have a quick visit to a sandy beach, not a visit to a quicksandy beach.
The good thing about climate change is we only need to be drawn from the waist up.
OK, so now you’ve been to a nude beach.
We're duned!
Come to think of it, I'm more of a 'mountains' person.
Are you sure this is what Google Maps said?
Finally, a vacation without the kids.
Is this sand or water?"
Talieah Ram, Oahu, HI
Next time we'll just take the surge pricing instead"
At least we can still do this at low tide.
I told you we should have moved to the Berkshires!
What’d they do to the moon this time?

Bernie, I am not leaving here until you tell me what happened last weekend.
I think my fresh trout dinner just swam away.
Yes, well I guess this is, technically, 'on the lake.'
So is this what you meant by “sunbathing?”
Can you give me the towel?
It might have been a mistake to listen to Blondie.
This wasn’t what I meant when I said we should move somewhere with rising values.

THEY SAY THAT THE SUN'S RAYS AREN'T DANGEROUS AFTER 4

Just when you think your 25th anniversary is going fine and swell"
We're getting a head start on this year's hurricane wrap party.
Climate Change: “Sure, your half empty beer floats.  But my half full wine is under water.”

Fred, float me a beer
I would not order Surf and Turf at this place again.
According to the recipe, this is when the poaching begins.
I wasn't talking about your mortgage
You're not peeing are you? Yes. Me, too.
Should we do this again next summer?
the unbrells's crooked.
You're right, honey, global warming does feel cooling right now.
Don't worry - it is just a Chinese Hoax!
Ok, suppose I was  a bit wrong and should not have payed attention to trump about global warming. After all, the economy is really great and, we had enough money to take a vacation.

Darling, it’s sinking hot out here today.
No, I'm not salty about our vacation.
A "hoax", my ass!
Jeff proposed an alternative to suntan lotion.
Attention people of Earth! We are the floating torsos of evil.  Prepare to be incinerated.
It’s warmer than I remember.
Yes, this is the last umbrella but I think we can do better.
On the bright side the higher sea level does keep you cooler.
Well at least your sandwich will have all that sea-salt you wanted.
Isn't this just a lovely view of the water?
Why are these people staring at us?
Ever since we got here I’ve felt rather bogged down
They say it's a result of global warming, but I believe it's just high tide.
Well, they did sell us on the point that we couldn't get any closer to nature...
I know the ocean view restaurant was here somewhere.
Well sure, but it wasn't caused by human activities.

Don't freak out, but I'm reasonably certain we're sitting in dolphin blood.
Summer reflections from the East coast.
Well Honey, I guess we are finally on the same waive length!!
Did the tide just come in, or is this climate change? Or both?

Well, the tables are right to show the high tide here as mean.
We should have signed up for the submarine ride.

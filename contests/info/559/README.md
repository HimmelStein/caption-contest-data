In this contest we ran the two active algorithms with the top 50 captions from
both experiments. After they completed, we ran random sampling with the top 50
captions from both trials, and another random 50 captions to find the true
winner.

This week, for all captions that had at least one duplicate caption, I included a single, exact duplicate of the original caption for comparison purposes. These duplicate captions are listed below:

No, sir, this is Fenway. You're looking for Jurassic Park.
I’d say your timing’s a bit off.
Remember, if I catch the ball you stop trying to hit it.
How long you been with the club?
Yes, I know what an ‘out’ is. I’m a Neanderthal, not a moron.
That's not why I'm squatting.
Is it true you played for Cleveland the year they won the Series?
Look, pal,  the game has evolved.
Yeah, I hate the throwback uniforms too.
This isn't a normal side effect Kenny.. how much of it did you take?!
When I heard a new batter had been recruited from B.C., I naturally assumed Boston College.
Spent a while in the minors, eh?
The irony here is that millions of guys are watching this game in their man-caves.
Sorry buddy... this is Fenway Park, not Jurassic Park.
I wouldn't slide if I were you.
Don't worry, one day you'll be able to stand upright too.
Finally got called up, eh?
Still no shoe endorsement, huh?
You swing like a gatherer.
This explains the artwork in the dugout.
Watch out. His fastball is on fire, if that term means anything to you.
Coach has you really taking the Paleo seriously these days, huh?
I'll bet your baseball card is worth a lot.
Why do you catch it, if you're not gonna eat it?
I see you made the club.
Maybe the games do last too long.
This is Fenway Park, not Jurassic Park.
Still eating paleo?
I've been carbon-dating your sister.
Well, well...now look who's standing upright and who isn't.
Baseball confusing game. How can man walk with four balls?
A lot has happened since your last at bat.
You got this - he's been throwing rocks all day.
When he says ‘strike’, don’t.
Do me a favor, and if you slide into home, come in head-first
So you're the mammoth slugger people are talking about.
Actually, the Cubs did finally win.
You must have spent a long time in the minors.
um...I'm here for the Trump rally
Isn't this the best Old-Timers' Day ever?
I've been sitting on the bench for ages.
You know they are going to check you for steroids.
You're back?  I thought you retired like a million years ago!
Finally. It felt like I was in the minors for a thousand years.
It looks counterintuitive, but I'm what you evolved to.
Flintstone? He was traded to the Colorado Rockies.
We don't get that many bunter-gatherers here in the big leagues.
First time with the big club?
I only hit what I can eat
Say what you will, 
being a designated hitter has kept a lot of us old guys in the game.
Look, I don't care if you discovered fire, three strikes means you're out!
Strike!” Doesn’t mean hit me
My God. How long were you on deck?
When your manager says ‘sacrifice,’ he’s not talking about me.
Do you also talk softly?
I hate Old Timers day
Yeah, the game's evolving too.
Now that you're upright, we're gonna walk you.
Bob, maybe it's time to rethink that Paleo Diet.
I do believe you are batting out of geological order
You're ages late.
These throwback uniforms are getting outta control.
You're early man.
You’ll fit in perfectly, as long as you stand for the anthem.
The old timers game is next week.
Unless you're wearing underwear, I wouldn't slide into any base.
Just remember, no one wants to see you slide in that thing.
So, just how long were you in the minors?
You're history.
This is my first time up with the big club
It's round..Like a wheel. Oh, but you don't know that yet.
If he yells strike,don't.
The pitcher's on fire? What's fire?
I'm assuming you came out of left field.
Ooog's on first? I don't get it...
Be calm. He’s not throwing AT you.
How long did you say you were in the minors?
There's no time limit in this game.  If it takes 3 million years, it takes 3 million years!
It makes me VERY nervous that you're looking in the wrong direction.
Speak softly.
So, how long did you say you were in the minor leagues?
So have you noticed any side effects from the steroids?
It really has been a while since Cleveland won the series.
These throwback jerseys are getting ridiculous.
Let me guess...you also speak softly.
Ladies and gentleman, next up to bat...President Trump as seen by the rest of the planet!
Just so we’re clear here... I’m not really a tiger.
You have a chance to make prehistory here.
'Amazing how much the game has evolved.
Cocktails and Opera at the Met after the game?
Is it just me, or does a baseball game seem to take ages?
Wow, the designated hitter rule appears to have really extended your career.
Now THAT's a throwback uniform.
Sure Buddy, go ahead. Knock it into the Stone Age.
I'm guessing they'll want a urine test from you after the game.
Oh, great, another hipster ballplayer with a beard and a homemade organic bat.
Remember!  After I catch the ball you have to stop hitting it!
I hear they call you the Natural.
This may be difficult for you to grasp, but he's throwing fire tonight.
We have to wait for someone to invent the ball.
I'm not pooping, I'm the catcher.
Lemme guess... First time?
Gary, you’re a mascot. You can’t actually play.
When the ump says 'Strike', he doesn't mean him with your club.
If this doesn't work out, you could always get a job at the White House."
Now that you're erect, how would you feel about an intentional walk..
You must be here for the Really Old Timer's game.
Did you just call me a homosapien?
Well, I hope you're wearing underwear this time!
Do you have to drag your wife here to watch you play?
Slugger, maybe it's time to ease off the paleo diet.
You built it, so I came
Republican Party Headquarters? Turn right on Elm Street.
Do you think they’re taking throwback uniforms too far?
I bet you hit like my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother.
Everybody warned you taking steroids would have side effects.
I'm assuming you won't be bunting.
Yeah the baseball age is almost over too.
It looks like we have a Trump supporter coming to bat.
It'll be a crime if I don't get Comeback Player of the Year.
Well, well. The bunter-gatherer returns.
I think you might be taking this Paleo diet a bit too far, Carl.
So you must be the bottom of the order?
No worries, with that beard you fit right in.
Love those throwback uniforms.
The ump told me to tell you that you’re out.
Our owner took throwback​ jersey night a little too far.
The pitcher's gotta see your knees.
I'm on loan from the Smithsonian
I’m here for old timers day
Smart to wait until the money got good.
Just making a wild guess here, but you might wanna cut back on the steroids.
Boston No Sox?
I don't care what Coach Rubble told you, Bam-Bam, it's not a regulation bat.
These retro uniforms are getting out of hand, if you ask me.
So "strike" has a COUPLE of meanings...
Before we get started here, I just want to make sure that your definition of  "strike"  is the same as mine.
I hope you don't have to slide, bro.
Sorry, the rules say you need protective headgear and underwear.
They said you were old school.
You have my vote for Comeback Player of the Year.
You're late.
I'm guessing you're not up here to bunt.
I don't care about the rest, but you should wear a cup!
We've all tried the vintage uniforms, but the vintage bat is something special.
Just run to first if you hit it. No need to reinvent the... never mind.
I liked your drawings in the clubhouse.
"Really, your first old timers game?"
I'm going to make baseball great again.
So you're the pinch hunter-gatherer.
You should wear a helmet. The pitcher is a creationist.
How did you guys do against the Tigers?
You guys are throwing way, way back with those uniforms.
You was right, Yogi. The future ain't what it used to be.
HOMER Erectus!
How’s Wilma?
Well, this is certainly a prehistoric moment.
Am I late?
You're about to learn how to count to three.
Just so you understand ... it's the ball you hit ... ok ?
If he hits me l hit you
Ah. So we're back to squatting.
Just be careful with the backswing, OK?
Three strikes and I'm out? One strike and you're out.
You're Out! Do I have to draw you a picture?
Just up from the bush league?
Sigh. Where do the Yankees find you guys.
Don't argue with the ump. He's a Neanderthal.
This 'throwback uniform' thing is getting out of hand.
Want me to tell you what's coming? How about I tell you what's coming? Fastball, slider, competition with a superior species and mass extinction.
So you're the one not on steroids?
The scouting report on you says you carry a big stick, but you have no wheels.
Do I look  like I’m about to bunt?
The game kinda evolved!
Can you believe it?
5,297,345,498,712,842 innings and we’re STILL tied!
The bat says it is legal. Wanna argue with it?
You guys take this old timers game way too seriously
Well, if it isn’t the player to be named later.
This is a pastime, not a past time.
You're the first pro magnon.
I have a feeling you are going to be randomly selected for a drug test after this game.
Old school hitter. I like that.
How long did they keep you in the minors?
Of course I can walk upright!
Dude, I'm so stoned.
What’s your bashing average?
My dad didn’t want me doing cave art anymore.
Its not the ball I'm worried about.
So, you're the guy who has to carry the club on his shoulders.
On this next pitch, try to hit the ball instead.
I don't mean to profile, but I'm guessing you're looking for the clubhouse?
That was a long inning!
We invented fire and this is the best thing you guys could come up with?
So you're tellin me, you all get paid to hit things with sticks?
Wow, how long have we been playing?
When the man says strike, he doesn’t mean me!
Aluminium, composite or stegosaurus?
Go ahead, call me Fred Flintstone one more time.
There are no actual tigers. We are the Detroit Tigers.
It's all good,the pitcher is throwing rocks today anyway.
How many contract extensions have you had?
Still walking softly, eh?
That's four.  Walk upright to first.
This time, don't eat it after you club it.
The most difficult aspect of this was the required change in my swing from the vertical to the horizontal.
It's the thing that looks like a wheel, but rounder.
It's the top of the 21st.
You're not really from the Dominican Republic, are you?
Kill the ump" is just a saying. They didn't mean it.
When the umpire calls a strike DON’T hit me!
That guy you smashed over the head and dragged off the field last inning is called the umpire.
He’s throwing fire, but I guess you don’t know what that is.
My E.R.A.? 10,000 b.c.
Well, it's a metaphorical home.
What's your ERA?
You can’t tell me my stance is primitive when you’re only semi-erect.
The Natural
Up from the bush league?
Throwback uniform day is tomorrow, Frank.
This this Fenway, you must be looking for Jurassic.
Call me a Luddite, but I don’t trust aluminum bats.
I suppose you are going to tell me you found that in the club house.
Are we in a Geico commercial?
Welcome to Old Timer's Day.
Someone painted a Bison on my locker know anything about that?
No, you can't hit him first to keep him from throwing the ball at you.
Ya know, the Yankees are going to make you shave that beard!
Wow, that Paleo diet you're on is really working!
Evolution is just a game to you people, isn't it?
While his baseball career was otherwise undistinguished, Zekk son-of-Krob is widely credited with the first walk in history.
I don’t care how thick your skull is - you still need a batting helmet.
…and that's what a wheel is. Now a ball…
One of us is having a very strange day.
Spend a long time in the minor leagues ?
You the guy who speaks softly?
He's going to try to walk you.  You can walk, right?
I'm hitting this one back to the Stone Age.
Just play by the rules, ok? You're not here to reinvent the wheel.
My uniform? Beaver. I find wool too itchy and polyester too hot.
There's no grunting in baseball.
Yeah, I’m totally back on steroids.
They call me the home-run erectus
I don't much care for the throwback uniforms either!
Paleo diet? Yeah, I know a place.
I can teach you how to stand upright.
So, I hit ball over fence and I end up at home? Who invented this stupid game?
Back in my day the catcher didn't wear a mask.
Normally, the batter wears a protective helmet, but something tells me you're going to be OK.
I invented this game
You're taking 'Throwback Night' a bit too seriously
How many years were you down in the minors?
So you're the living proof ....the games are too long.
When was the last time you played?
Nope. Never touched 'em. Why do you ask?
It's for a GEICO ad.
We're the Tigers. The Mammoths are playing next door.
Let me guess...you thought I was gonna be a leftie.
oh, I get it...you plan on hitting the next ball back to the stone age
I’m OK with you using the club as a bat, but if you’re gonna wear that getup you gotta promise not to slide feet first into home plate.
We stopped using rocks 10,000 years ago
Goin'' "old school," Champ?
Yep, there is no time limit in baseball.
Exactly how long have you been in the dugout?
I get it: Pinstripes don't work for everybody.
You're in luck, he's throwing rocks today.
He likes to pitch Neanderthals high and tight .
Just so ya know, I'm gonna ask the ump to check that bat.
Fair warning; you’ll regret it if you slide into home plate in that uniform!
This your first time at bat?
It's an old model Louisville Slugger; they never break.
I heard you paint caves in the off-season.
Designated hitter, I presume?
The game hasn't evolved much.
You're supposed to hit the ball, just the ball, only the ball, nothing but the ball!
I'm a "presteroid" man!
No, no......you play with a club.....not with a club.
I guess if you count the umpires, yes, you have had two hits today.
Sorry sir, you misunderstand. Tigers is just the name of our team.
Strike one what?
...here for the Ken Burns prequel.
Why didn’t you stand during the National Anthem?
You're damn straight I can walk upright!
Old Timer's Day has gotten out of hand
If it does not help with my hitting, I can at least kill dinner with it.
I know he said 'strike,' but he didn't mean me!
Gosh, baseball really is an archaic sport.
What? No shoe endorsement deal?
Here's the Deal, you strike out and I'll teach you how to make fire.
Damn, this game is taking forever.
After the game, want to go clubbing?
Catcher: "I've HEARD that steroids could have some side effects."
No caves...they're called dugouts.
"There is no point. Just hit the ball.
I got this.  Been practicing for millennia.
Initially, I just stopped shaving.
Are you ever going to retire?
It's three on and two out in bottom of the ninth, not that you can count.
I'm hitting the next pitch back to the Stone Age.
I called you a Homo because that's your genus.
Congrats on finally being called up.
If you've never seen a wheel, a ball may be a bit of a stretch.
There are two outs and it’s the bottom of the Eocene
Remember, don't take 'sacrifice hit' literally.
No, baseball hasn't evolved at all.
This time, try swinging horizontally.
Listen, you drew a walk. Erect or not is up to you.
You Red Sox are taking this "Fear the Beard" thing far too seriously!
I’m giving baseball a go, hunting and gathering is tough on the joints.
When I was a rookie, we used to called this place Shea.
You must be the rookie from Bedrock.
Don't slide.
Love the throwback jersey.
That's three strikes! Can't you count?
After four balls, you drag your knuckles to first.
"This guy's got the perfect pitch for you -- a dragging knuckleball.
"Sometimes I think this whole throwback uniform thing has gone a bit too far."
How long have you been with the club?
Yo mama wears shoes.
I thought we were trying to modernize the sport.
Shoeless Joe? Are you reinstated?
Last guy that wore that slid into home. Some things you just cant unsee.
Oh, great. Another GEICO commercial.
Dude, TOMORROW is retro uniform night.
Ken Burns never covered this...
Ok, Bam Bam, let'e see what you can do.
I see that you're with a new club.
Hold on. We're inventing the ball.
I thought the steroid era was over.
Look -- 'strike one' is a statement, not a command.
Hey dude, I see that whole Paleo diet thing is really working for you!!!
I am not a big fan of "Throwback" uniforms either.
Why you make signal that lion is coming?
Wow! The METS really have hit rock bottom.
I don't care if you have only two strikes - you're still history
I guess this really is America’s past time.
So, Wilma or Betty?
For this I was unfrozen?
I thought the league banned the use of Neanderthal.
It's the CUBS not the "Clubs."
we usually don't cave till the ninth inning.
It takes 4 balls to get to first base? What kinds of men play this game?”
Not to make you nervous, but Fred and Wilma are in the bleachers.
Do you speak softly . . . ?”
Best throwback uniforms ever
Hey Fred, I slept with Wilma.
You can't drag the ballgirls by the hair.
Were you with the Hunters or the Gatherers before being called up?
we haven't squatted like that in over 66 million years.
What, were you born yesterday?  Go get a helmet.
I hear you spent a lot of time in the minor leagues.
We know you are doing paleo Scott, but this is a bit much.
Gotta hand it to you, most guys retire after 300,000 years.
Sorry, but you're a Neanderthal. You've already got two strikes against you.
I hunt. I do not bunt.
That was a split-seam fastball on the lower outside corner. Any more questions?
I heard you hit one out of Jurassic Park.
Now remember, after you hit the ball you don't run after it and skin it."
They say you were frozen in ice for thousands of years.  Take a couple practice swings.
Lookin' good. Paleo diet?
Do you want to go clubbing after the game?
How's that paleo diet working for you?
And you think I look strange?
Not exactly. They’re Detroit Tigers not saber-tooth tigers.
You're the designated hunter, not hitter.
Okay, one more time, “kill ‘em” is just an expression.
I know there's no pine tar on it, but I still don't think it's legal.
You come up from the B.C. farm team?
What are you, some kind of a Neanderthal? Put on a helmet!
Growing your playoff beard already, eh?
So if I hit you, then we're both out?
Where's the girl?
Heeeyyyy clubber, clubber, clubber...
I've got good news.  I can save you 15% on car insurance.
I see you and our pitcher use the same barber.
It's a bat, get over it.
No, I’m signaling
Geez. First, politics and now, baseball.
Ok, deal. You don't bunt, and I show you Match.com.
Who you calling neaderthal?
Wait!  "Strike" is just a figure of speech.
Yes, clubbing me counts as a strike.
So you're the missing link in their pennant hopes?
Three strikes and your extinct!
Yeah, I was down in the minors a long time.
Why do you ask?
How about you call for a fastball down the middle; and I won’t accidentally pound you into the ground
Whaddya mean this ain't no bat. I got it from the clubhouse!
That's some sponsorship you picked up there Ed.
The email clearly said "Cubs," not "clubs"
Took you awhile to get here, didn't it?
I’m old school.
The game has evolved.
Which man do I hit?
Don’t worry, the last time this pitcher struck anyone out, everyone looked like you.
So I'm guessing you're not into analytics.
Can you slide in that?
This game is taking forever.
If I hit it, can I eat it?
Yes, it is a very nice dugout.
Time for a mammoth home run.
Dude, isn't it about time you retire.
Interesting. You guys call it a dugout. We call it a cave.
Can you tell me how to get to the batter's cave?
I'd get a helmet if I were you.  Our pitcher's a Neanderthal.
I'm just saying 'three strikes and you're extinct' is a little harsh.
I think we're just going to walk you.
Sox? What are sox?
How long have you been on the bench?
Who’s on First?
No, it's not a cave, it's called the dugout.
...and, any ball hit into the tar pits is a ground rule double....
I think you're taking this paleo-diet thing a little too far!
This is my third old timers day, you?
I heard you were called up from the Neanderthals
Don't worry. This game hasn't changed since the Stone Age.
No exceptions. Ump's got to see your knees.
Three strikes, you evolve.
These 'old-timer' games sure get tougher every year, huh?
I guess in your case, it really is a ball club.
'Kill the umpire' doesn't actually mean that.
I see why they call you "Shoeless Joe."
Did it hurt to have the cleats installed?
Think maybe you’re taking this Throwback Uniform Day a little too far?
... and then they introduced the DH rule.  And now you're up to date.
You get three of them. Someone else will count for you.
Shoeless Joe from Jurassic Mo.
Even for the seventh inning, this is a stretch!
The lizard stole my Geico gig
How’s that Paleo Diet working for you, Mike?
He’s batting .500 B.C.
You haven’t made it to the World Series in how long again?
No Swinging if I catch the ball. Ok?
So easy even a caveman can do it.
Watch out for the umpire.  He's a real  Neanderthal.
What’s with all the shaggy beards in baseball these days?
The pitcher has reached a bygone ERA.
These throwback jerseys are getting out of hand.
These 'Turn Back The Clock Day' uniforms are getting a little ridiculous.
It was a regulation bat the last game I played"
I just saved 15% on my car insurance.
Sometimes I feel like this game drags on for ages
Don't you think your team is getting ridiculous about their throwback uniform days?
Dude, you know that your throwback uniforms suck, right?
I'm gluten-free and juiced.  Bring it.
Been playing minor league ball for quite awhile, huh?
So, that paleo diet seems to be working for you.
Don't look at me, hit the ball, and then they'll feed you
Tell Mr. Veeck I like the midget better.
Wow, way to commit to the Old Timers Game Jason.
Whatever you do, don't slide.
Talk about a heavy hitter ...
Are you the player to be named later?
This is taking throw-back uniforms to the extreme.
No, I’m not taking a knee! Put the club down and go back to your seat.
He's throwing fire? What is fire?
They said if I made the club i could play
It figures. A Trump supporter bats righty.
Repeat after me. Hit ball. Not head.
I had it custom made. It's called The Bat Out Of Hell.
Homie, I literally invented fire...but go ahead, tell your guy to bring the heat.
He throws a knuckleball. No offense.
Aren't you taking the whole vintage uniforms thing a bit too far?
Sure, I'm sure.  The 'Old Timers Game' is next week!
No do that here. Here home!
You’ve never heard of steroids, what do you live in a cave?
Is it the seventh eon stretch, already?
Hit ball, not catcher!
With global warming, I feel like that uniform is the future.
You the guy they called up from Bedrock?
Mets farm team?
No, not me.  Hit the ball.
Who am I supposed to hit?
I heard you usually cave.
All that padding won't help you, if you flip me off again.
Do I wait till you catch the ball before hitting it?
It's called Baseball.  Have you been living in a cave?
No kidding, you met your wife using that same club.
What's the name of your Club?
What's the point of anything, really?
The millennials in marketing inisist this plays up the timeless appeal of baseball.
I don't steal, I take.
They're not booing because you drag women around by the hair and club your kids. They're booing because you're hitting .198.
No, Ugs on first, What's on second!
If you're lucky enough to get to third, don't even think about sliding into home.
Do you slide in that thing?
Okay.  First of all, "Strike!" means something a whole lot different here.
Thag no like infield fly rule.
The umpire has a bone to pick with you.
Looks like it took you a while to get called up.
Yeah, it's a throwback uniform.
I can’t believe they accused you of using steroids.
No like inside fast ball.
Just remember. You hit the ball not me.
Going clubbing after the game?
Are you saying that someone BEFORE Doubleday invented baseball?
First club owner, right?
I asked him to walk you.
Now batting for Brooklyn...
If nothing else Tebow, you’re not a quitter
I hope that's not real fur.
Maybe they should have explained your duties as a mascot better.
Just don't throw the bat, alright?
Kind of taking the whole 'throwback uniform' theme to a new level, huh Terrence?
Going Paleo has definitely helped my game, but man I miss the carbs.
I agree. Those insurance commercials were cultural appropriation.
Remember:  the idea is to swing at the ball as hard as you can, without hitting it.
It's pretty simple: see the ball, hit the ball.
Please tell me you plan to bunt.
Am I allowed to drag the pitcher around the bases by his hair?
Quite a year buddy. First you invent the wheel, and now a chance for the cycle.
Your swing is primitive, but I see promise.
WHAT KIND OF SIGNING BONUS DID YOU GET?
That's your plan? To walk softly!
Don't worry, the game hasn't changed much.
You just come up from the bush leagues?
No, beating the catcher to death with a runner on third base would definitely NOT be considered a "sacrifice fly."
Yooooooouuu'rrreee eeeextiiinct!
I take it you're not an analytics guy.
I've been in the dug out for ages
I see you're classically trained.
I was told there'd be women
Relax a few rules on facial hair and look at what you get.
Bamm Bambino. You must be Fred and Wilma’s son?
I'm pinch-hitting for Homo erectus.
Whoa, since when are the Red Sox bipeds?
One more strike and you're history.
So, you're coming out of  retirement?
Designated hominoid”. Very funny. Never heard that one before.
“It’s four balls and three strikes. Have you been living in a cave?”
Remember, after clubbing the ball do NOT drag me to the bases!
Can't believe the Yankees didn't make you shave that thing
Baseball? Next thing you'll be wanting fire.
And I thought pinstripes were old school.
Seems like ages since I last saw you
Please, I know he's throwing the 'knuckledragger.'
I don't think you understand the concept of a baseball club.
Why you dress as turtle ... crouch in dust?
Johnny Damon! That looks like it's a little longer than 42 inches.
Still using hand gestures to communicate?
You can put that down. You're out Flinstone.
Did you just get called up from the Neanderthals?
Fig. 1.  Homer erectus
So when they said The Neanderthal is up next, I thought it was a nickname!
You could bunt and fool everyone."
Honestly? I'd just tell her how you feel.
You might want to back up.
I've been traded to the Mets.
You're looking for the Tigers. We're the Yankees.
I've heard your rookie carving is worth a fortune.
LIMERICK: Before Shoeless Joe there was Paul...A legend at hitting the ball...At the pitcher he sneered...While rockin his beard...Then clubbed em out over the wall.
It's just like the Red Sox to bring up some ancient history.
You look like you come from a different E.R.A.
I really hope you're not the catcher for your team.
I know it's not a regulation bat, Luis, but do YOU wanna be the one to tell him?
Remember, you hit the ball not the pitcher.
Hit ball, BAD! Miss ball, GOOD!
You come up from the minors?
You're right 10,000 years in the minors does seem like a long time.
How long were you on the disabled list?
Look, I don't like these time-travel leagues anymore than you do, but we gotta play ball.
Haven’t seen a bat like that in ages!
So how long have you been in the Minors?
Don't throw the club.
I knew that once they allowed facial hair it would eventually come to this.
Nice retro uniform !
I think they will put an asterisk next to this one.
You're going to need a bigger mitt.
I see you're taking the divorce well, Gregg.
These retro uniforms are getting out of hand.
Of  course you can have  unlimited strikes - no problem at all.
I hear you not like Trump. That right?
Have you got the stones for this
The guy on First Base is kinda worried you won't drop the bat after you hit the ball.
A ball is thrown and you try to  hit it. It's worthless unless you do it frequently, and then you become wealthy beyond your dreams. But yes, it's still worthless. It's hard to explain.
I'm not implyin' nuttin'; I'm sayin' you got the look of a guy who's on the juice.
You say you're batting a thousand...B.C.?
I don’t think you can use petrified wood.
You know how Mr. Steinbrenner feels about beards.
No need to swing, I'm signaling for a walk.
I heard you were just called up from the Paleolithic era.
For the last time, you have to hit the ball BEFORE it's in my glove.
Word is you spent ages in the minors.
This is Yankee Stadium fella; put some shoes on.
No drawings on the dugout wall please
You, sir may expect a walk.
You do understand that the “hit and run” signal has a different meaning in the bigs?
I passed the drug screen.
Everything else I get. But buddy, no pants?
Not bat. Pitcher's leg.
Your comment about the designated hitter as being a natural result of the evolutionary process of baseball is duly noted.
What? Never seen facial hair on a ballplayer?
Grok do hit, squatman live.
It felt like I was in the minors for ages.
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey Roy, how’s that paleo diet working for you?
Hey Bob, I think it's time for an intentional walk.
Back out of retirement again?
We haven't seen a hitter like you in ages.
Careful with the backswing.
It's 'pastime', not 'past time'.
Did you find that in the clubhouse?
I see you found the clubhouse.
Congrats on passing Pete Rose for most plate appearances.
It’s a throwback uniform.
Don't cave in
I thought you retired ages ago.
Throwback uniforms have really gotten out of hand.
How long since you last hit.
Jurassic is good but I prefer Fenway.
I hear you're from the BC league ...
Just try to make contact. You don't have to kill it.
Hey bud, the old-timer's game was yesterday.
At least you get to play with you favorite club.
-	Ug had blended in surprisingly well since the thawing, but it was the nuances of modern life which finally gave him away.
I've seen cave paintings of your swing. You're history.
The scouting report says your swing is primitive.
Yeah, you can eat it, but only if it goes over the fence.
Your first old-timer’s game, huh?
I dare you to bunt.
So, how much is Bill Veeck paying you for this gig?
I was told this was a club sport.
I see you've been on the paleo diet.
Wait. When the ump calls strike one, it's about the ball, right?
ICE didn’t know where else to send me.
No, I am not going Number 1 or Number 2.
I said slugger, not slug her
Three yabadabadoos and you're out.
No, I will not teach you how to read my signs.
You sure you’re off the steroids?
Remember, it's just a game!
I think the Paleo diet might be affecting your game.
I just learned how to intentionally walk
Ball? Like wheel? But with another axis of rotational symmetry?
The beard, the hair, OK I get it. But is the caveman outfit even legal?
I knew this was going to happen after we implemented sabertoothmetrics.
If you hear 'STRIKE' it doesn't mean you're supposed to slug me with your bat!
I've heard you're a heavy hitter
I love a player who appreciates the history of the game
Stop whining--the strike zone isn't written in stone!
I speak softly, but carry a big stick.
You look much better without the mullet.
You are new to this game, aren't  you.
He's got a wicked caveball.
That paleo thing working out for you?
How’s the sensitivity training going?
Yeah, wouldn't be here without the DH rule.
Look who they thawed out for the Series
I find it offensive that you call that pitch the knuckle-dragger."
Would you like to go clubbing with us after the game?
No, there is no such thing as a "clubbing average."
They said the pinch hitter was a thing of the past, but I didn't believe it until now.
You're a little late for the old timers game.
You are taking the playoff beard to another level.
That’s the best throwback uniform I’ve ever seen!
So, is this the year you finally retire?
If the man on the little hill throws the white rock at me again, I'm going to take it out on you.
I’m going for the club record
I assume you're not going to bunt.
I have no idea where the umpire went. He called “strike three” and I assume he ran for his life.
Yes,  I’m wearing a dress , I’m also carrying a big stick .
I said Jurassic Park, not Fenway Park.
At least you developed the right tool for the job.
Congratulations on Bedrock getting an expansion team franchise.
Oh c'mon, weren't you traded like ten thousand years ago?
Let's see you knock it into the Stone Age slugger!
I’m a catcher. Not a gatherer.
Who's on first man?
‘Old Timer’s Day’ again, eh?
Mr. Rocktober?
I guess they weren't kidding about an Old Timer's game.
You just get called up from B.C.?
Your cave drawing doesn't do you justice.
Now remember, even though I'm on the other team, you're supposed to hit the ball, not me.
I said we're playing the Cubs - not with clubs
How long were you down in the minor leagues?
I'm guessing you're not gonna bunt.
Quite whining.  People have been complaining about the size of the strike zone since the Stone Age."
If ya not wearin' underwear I suggest ya try to get 'im to walk ya.
I came straight from the bat cave.
Man, these games are lasting forever!
Old timer's game?
Well, well, well...look who finally made it to the big club.
I'm telling you, size doesn't matter.
They said it was a club sport.
For the record, if he hits you with the pitch I had nothing to do with it.
You still have to wear a helmet.
You guys take this "baseball club" thing pretty serious, huh?
Old timers game was yesterday
That's pretty old-school. No batting gloves.
I don't care if you do work for POTUS.  You can't stand there.
So you're Joe Jackson!
I still think that "Nantucket Neanderthals"  perpetuates inappropriate stereotypes.
That's three strikes.  Now put down your club.
The Yankees finally loosened their appearance policy.
No, mostly mastodons. What's a slider?
You must be the designated hunter
I started the Paleo diet and one thing led to another...
You play ball like a gatherer!
I'm going to make a wild guess that bunting is not an option.
This is Comiskey Park, you must be looking for Jurassic Park.
No, that was the umpire. This time, aim for the little ball.
Is it true you speak softly?
I hope you are wearing underpants.
You seem like more of an unwritten rules guy to me.
Now that’s what I call a major league ball club!
I took the off-season beard too far.
Meeting you after the game for clubbing does not sound fun.
This is the Washington Senators baseball team.  You want the troglodytes in the White House.
You hunter. Me gatherer.
So . . . just exactly how long had you been in the minors before they called you up?
Just so you know - I don't take kindly to strike calls.
You hit. Me catch.
So.  The paleo diet finally reaches the big leagues.
Just saying, a cup can come in pretty handy around here”
Now, don’t hit me.  Hit the ball!
“Where’s your helmet Gorth ?”
Just called up from the Magnon Crows?
Know any Yogi Berra stories?
I heard you were picked to keep your team in the hunt.
Seems like the game started centuries ago!
Hey, man, the game's evolved in the last few thousand years.
Did you know 15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more on car insurance?
Sorry about the heckling, but some fans are uncivilized.
When do they start throwing the women?
I love your throwback uniform.
So, you’re telling me it’s more than just a diet now?
So, you've been at this for a while, Zog. Ever think about retiring?
Long time in the minors,huh?
You know that the point of the game is to hit the ball, right?
Finding players who would accept nuts and berries as payment wasn’t easy, but the Yankees were serious about staying under the luxury-tax threshold this year.
You must be the gatherer.
They haven't retired you yet?
Can I hit?  They don’t call me “Bam Bam” for nothing.
So they call you Babe because you wear a dress?
I get strike, you get club.
Is that pine tar on the bat?
Am I in the wrong cartoon-I was looking for Fred Flintstone.
He means strike as a noun, not as a command. Please stop hitting me over the head.
Old Timers' Day was last week, Buddy
Don't beat yourself up, nobody understands the infield fly rule.
Twelve years in the minors will do this to you.
You use plates?
Just yabba dabba doo it!
You the guy that hit the mammoth shot last night?
Has Pebbles started T-ball?
Watch me hit a mammoth homerun.
Where'd they dig you up?
Obviously you made the club.
No, no, this is Dodger Stadium.  You want the Paramount lot over on Melrose.  Take Sunset to Alvarado, then get on the 101...
I thought you got traded to the Giants.
Why you show him throw me curve rock?
Baseball club? Baseball bat? What's the difference?
I suggest that if you are going to slide, go head first.
Okay, ten strikes
The strike zone is between the letters and the knees. Can't see either.
I don’t care what the Commissioner says. The game moves too slowly.
The umpire just quit
The pine tar ought to be the least of your worries.
Those steroids are really changing your appearance.
'Catchers'? We call them 'Gatherers'.
I’m with the Chicago Clubs
It you're planning to drag me back to your cave, you should know I'm a pitcher not a catcher.
I think it’s great that you’re team has casual Fridays
Nice try Bailey. Now go get a regulation bat.
I saw your stats on the cave wall. Pretty impressive.
Ok fire doesn't do us any good ,
we need you to invent the ball.
You ball club. Me club ball.
This IS a wooden bat!
I've always wondered what happened to Bam Bam.
Use your words.
Before you slide into home plate, please tell me you have underwear on."
...analytics says you can really “crush the ball”?...
Here's your chance to rewrite history and take the lead away from those pennant-hogging Homo sapiens!
There's nothing like the Old-Old-Timers' game.
Now batting for the MAGA Mouthbreathers...
I see by your uniform that you swing both ways.
I see you brought your own bat.
Nice throwback uniform, Ted
You must be the rookie from Alabama.
You were DH for the Mastadons? Who did the Mets have to give up?"
Me catch...you hit.
No, not me, the ball.
Ehhh batter batter....your mother is a Neanderthal!
yep, still not using technology for balls & strikes, just the same visually impaired old guy behind me!
I'm embracing the Paleo thing>
Throwback uniform day is tomorrow.
If you give me just 15 minutes after the game, I think I can save you 15% on your car insurance!
I don't mean to be intrusive but your left heel is out of the batter's box.
This paleo thing is getting crazy.
Good to see you're off the juice
When I hear "Strike" I hit you,Right?
You think I look weird the way I am dressed ?
Maybe it's time to lay off the paleo diet for a while.
Designated by who?
That not home.  No way in.
Homo Erectus, huh? Better watch yourself in the locker room.
Who's throwing the rock today?
First Tebow. Now this? The Mets will do anything...
How long you been in the minors?
So your team scout has a DeLorean?
I'd hate to be your teams equipment manager.
Don't patronize me. Grog know difference between grunt and bunt.
I was told to crush the umpire. Are you the umpire?
I thought Boston was next week.
It may be your turn, but it's not your time.
Hey Bush Leaguer, this must be your first at bat with the big club.
You must be the heavy hitter.
you're right. it's not actually a plate.
I've been designated to make a sacrifice.
Wow! That must be some endorsement deal you got.
He's throwing fire.  But I don't suppose you know about that.
I heard you faced Colon during his prime.
That ump is a real Neanderthal !
I've heard of old timers day, but this is ridiculous
I'm hoping for a strikeout so you can hit the showers.
It's a bit smaller than a skull, and almost as much fun.
You know, that club makes you look like a neanderthal.
You're taking the 'playoff beard' tradition too far.
I hope you’re wearing a cup. He’s throwing low and inside.
Hit ball. Not me!
Think you're some kind of mammoth slugger?
Retro night again?
So basically I hang out in that cave until it’s my turn to hit something really hard.
Pal, if you hit a homer, just take it easy with the bat flip.
I need a hit, or else they’re sending me back.
These throwback uniforms are becoming a bit ridiculous.
They told me I could find good game here!
Remember, the strike zone is between your armpit hair and your knee hair.
Awesome throwback uniform, dude.
Actually, I don't know how tasty I look.
How's that paleo conditioning program working out?
No signal pitcher for slider, or Ug brain you.
10,000 years and the only evolution is that the Club got smaller?
I’d lost track of how long this game is.
I haven't seen you in ages
No. Getting to first base has a different meaning here.
You hunter-gatherers don’t seem to get that in this game home never moves.
Ball four, walk upright.
Is that your girlfriend out there, or a mastodon walking backward?
Professional sports: so easy a caveman could do it
No, I don't have any naked cave drawings of my wife. Why?
I got it from the clubhouse; where else?
Juicing? I just barely discovered fire.
I've been in the minors for ages.
No. I never use pine tar.
Send message: Me hit ball, or me hit you.
So you were in the minors for a long time, huh?
Congrats; I saw you in this morning's cave painting.
I realize that you eat with your hands, but someday you'll understand dishware and wonder why it's called a "plate"
So you were rookie of the year - what year?
Swear to God, they were over the counter supplements.
Your shoelaces are untied.
Wrong ball club. Flintstones play Tuesday.
‘Is that a bat in your hand or are you just happy to be me.’
When you’re done taking a dump, would you mind tossing me a few balls?
That gives throw-back a whole different meaning.
I like the vintage uniform
Guess it took awhile to get called up.
Your team nutritionist has taken this paleo diet thing a bit too far..
Okay, that's strike number 2,999,999. One more and you're out.
I see you've exercised your club option.
I can't believe you walked that Neanderthal to pitch to me.
'I promised you a hot dog AFTER the game'
Try not to cave.
Ball club means something different these days.
Other than instant replay it's pretty much the same
And I thought it was just footballers who were Neanderthals!"
Hey, you can't bat with a mastodon leg!
It's been ages since I played
Okay Slugger, when he throws the coconut try to break it open.
I don't care if it's an anachronism, the rules say you gotta wear a helmet.
Finally, a “turn back the clock” uniform that matches the idiotic beards half the league is wearing.
Aren't you a little old for this game?
I don't know where the ump went.
Uh . . . that's not a regulation bat . . .
No, not sabre tooth.  Detroit.
The game has evolved since your rookie year.
Point taken, but I don't believe his hyper-realism is derivative at all.  If anything it could be an expression of irony given the material.
Oh!  Let's go Uggg.  Pitcher is ready.
It’s called a Pleistocene Slugger
I'm jealous. When did you begin standing upright?
I hate playing games at Jurassic Park.
With the pension rates in this league, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to retire.
I don't know if you can hit, but you bring new meaning to the words 'baseball club.' "
My backswing is a killer.
Thought you retired a few years ago.
WATCH THE BUNT!
So you're the Mighty Casey.
I found it in the clubhouse.
Take it easy on the scratching...
Look, I saw you dip the bat in the tar pit!
Just up from the minors; Paleolithic League.
Bat, club, tomato, tomahto.
I wondered why the bat was so big.  Then it hit me.
So long as there's no cork in your bat, you'll be Ok.
Where's the clubhouse?
When you were invited to bring your ball club to the game, that's not what they had in mind.
Gleg was disappointed there weren't more clubs in the clubhouse.
No, you may not look between my legs!
Hey, you forgot your helmet.
That's ball four pal, try to walk upright to first base.
No, it's not that - I just didn't see you as a leadoff guy.
These throwback uniforms are getting ridiculous.
Squatting hole is behind dugout.
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on it while you run the bases.
Don't tell me--you bat right, but you hunt left?
I don't think it's not "regulation".  Babe Ruth had a pretty heavy bat too.
Everybody knows you're juicing.
You give the Old-Timers Game a new twist.
Yeah, I spent a very long time in the minors.
Abner just CLAIMS to be the one who invented baseball.
Sure kid, they call you 'The Natural.' Like I never heard that before.
Is it just me, or does it feel like the world has really started to change?
The ball.  Not me.
You must be the Sabertooth Slugger.
Remember -- hit ONLY the ball.
It's amazing what we have to put up with on promotion nights in baseball.
Just don't drop the bat.
It's not that kind of past time
God, I hate these old-timer's day games.
Quit calling it "My Cave." It's a dugout.
This throwback-uniform fad is getting a bit extreme.
I'm sorry Pal, we STILL can't explain the infield fly rule!
Batting in the third position, Mel Brooks!
Remember, it’s three bonks you’re out.
Remember, do not carry me off the field this time.
GEICO laid me off
He throws a mean knuckle-dragger ball
I went Paleo.
You’re the only guy out here who can actually pull off that beard.
Yes, fire is bad.
Okay, try again, rules are hit the ball, you don't club me.
Is your club corked?
They'll do anything to put fans in the seats these days.
You mean it wasn’t Abner Doubleday ?
New away uniforms?
Promise me you won't be sliding into home plate.
According to Ancestry.com we are related.
It started with letting my hair grow during a hitting streak.
I don't care how long you've been hitting Tyrannosaur eggs into orbit; don't take your strikes out on me!
I may be a Neanderthal, but I know something about bat size.
Not me-- the ball.
Cal. Just between you and me, aren't you taking your Hair Club For Men endorsement a little too seriously?
I slept with your ancestors.
No shirt, no shoes, no service.
Yeah, I just got called up from the Bush League
Last week you learned to make fire. So you think this week you’re going to learn to hit a curve ball?
You busy after the game? A bunch of us are going clubbing.
after all our hard work getting ourselves evolved enough to stand, there you crouching again.
I hope you are wearing underwear
Is that one of those Neanderville sluggers?
I'm getting tired of these Old Timers Days.
Spitting, slapping butts, and swearing. Do you know what you're acting like?
Welcome to the big leagues, old timer.
Should I move closer?  And then what do I do?
You can’t play for the Yankees with hair like that
Well, Lascaux!
Ask the pitcher to walk me, my feet are killing me.
Back in my day, we called it "home rock".
The team needed some big timber in the lineup.
OK.  Don't overthink this.
It took me awhile to make the majors
Haven't you retired yet?
It's nice to see the league is becoming more inclusive.
I'm subbing for the pinch hitter. Got a problem with that?
Just because you invented the bat, doesn't mean that you get to play.
Welcome to the Major League, kid. You never gave up the dream, did you?
I’m guessing you were recruited based on sabertoothtigermetrics?
Why you squatting? You pooping?
Well, at least the beard is regulation.
Looks like you keep getting it backwards. You rubbed the steroid on the bat and injected the pine tar again!
Do I smell pine tar?
Nice dress, Alice.
Don't throw your bat, okay?
Is this your first time up, with the big club?
Yes, but are you willing to kneel for the anthem?
Not surprisingly, your differing interpretation of the game isn’t the strangest thing I’ve learned today.
I've seen curve balls, fast balls, and knuckle balls but you're my first odd ball!
I'd appreciate it if you'd knock off the Old Timers jokes.
Manager wants me to focus on fundamentals.
You on that Paleolithic Diet?
So you’re on the paleo diet?
Mr. President, what are you doing here?
No, 'Kill the ump' is just an expression. Like 'have a nice day.'
No, off the Mammoth is a ground-rule double.
Ooog have big stick, but Max throw fire!
Sir, for the last time, your seats are in section 702.
This is my 10,000th Old Timers' Day.
Wow! I didn't know the Yankees' dugout went so deep.
They took a long time calling you up!
Look all you want pal, we use numbers now!
This is my first Old Timer’s Game. How about you?
Well, look who's up, the guy they named foul balls after!
We're the Tigers, why?
You're Out! That's all there is to it.
I like THIS bat
Activated from the bush league?
This is first base. You want the club house.
Hate to tell you, but Old-Timers' Day is tomorrow.
Forget it.  By the time you lift that off your shoulder, the ball will be in my mitt.
What was it like before the designated hitter ruined the game?
This is why we shouldn't have the Designated Hitter rule.
Never do an endorsement deal for a paleo diet.
Was your rookie card a cave drawing?
That was a mammoth home run you hit last time.
I think you're taking the "throw back jersey" a bit too far,buddy.
I see you're a heavy hitter.
How's that Paleo diet working out, Greg?
I'm just saying I think they've gone too far with the throwback jerseys
If you hit it, don't chase it and eat it
Strike doesn't mean what you think it means.
An August call up from the Paleolithic League.
It figures you're on the Clubs
A bunch of us are going clubbing after the game.
Look, pal, at the college level the bat WILL be aluminum, regardless of the tariff.
New to the club?
You do know your career stats have long since been written in stone?
Gave the steroids to your bat as well, eh?
No, I don't want to go clubbing with you after the game!
I'm just guessing that's not a regulation Louisville Slugger.
...but a dugout is not the same as a cave.
I think they've taken these retro uniforms a bit too far.
It's not actually so easy a caveman could do it.
Watch out. The game is evolving.
You sure you're not related to Johnny Damon?
I guess the bunt sign is off.
It’s not going to be pretty if I have to slide.
So I get to bash anything in the "strike zone?"
Strike? I'll show you a strike.
The guy on the mound's a beast.
Poor guy hasn't learned to stand upright yet.
Bruce takes old timers day way too seriously
You can hit it with the club, but you don't get to eat it for dinner.
I’ve been taking a lot of Flintstones vitamins.
You're going to set this game back a thousand years.
I've heard of guys being called up from the bush leagues, but this is ridiculous!
When the season's over, I'm going to taking a painting course and spend time with the kids.
You want to know his ERA?
Are you sure that's what they meant by "baseball club"
Remember, you must remain upright as you round the bases.
That’s right buddy. They don’t call me Homer erectus for nuthin......
Long trip from the minors?
Didn't they tell you to wait in the clubhouse?
We don't use a rock anymore.
I love Old Timers’ Day.
Neanderthal is an insult now, not a compliment.
My Manager says I should speak softly.
You need to join the baseball club, not club the baseball.
What do you mean I need a helmet?
I think you are taking this whole Paleo thing a little too far.
I hear the Yankees want you to shave your beard.
"Well, at least you don't need tattoos to look threatening."
I hear you guys are looking for a heavy hitter.
I hit.
I thought you had retired.
I’d rather you speak softly
Wait! Let me guess. You're just up from Trump's farm club.
Watch out for his fast rock.
Louisville? No, it's from Lascaux.
I'm up from the minors.
No offense, but I hate the DH.
These throwback jerseys are getting completely out of hand.
I'm sorry, they consider extra chromosomes a "performance enhancer" nowadays.
I think you're taking this Paleo thing a bit too far.
WOW! It took you a long time  to get here  from the  minors.
Can we at least agree that the Mets suck?
Let me guess. You're making your old timers day debut!
Whachew expect, Buddy? We're the Flint Stones.
I love these new throwback uniforms.
You can’t think and hit at the same time. But that will not be a problem in your case.
Bro...how are ya gonna slide in that get up??
Listen BamBam, we need you to knock one into the Stone Age!
I’m a Pro-Magnon, if that’s what you’re asking....
Been down in the minors for awhile?
It's my first Old-timers Game - you?
Make baseball great again!
Still on the paleo diet?
I meant "wasn't." It wasn't a strike.
Yeah, my wife also went on the paleo diet; I have to wear this gear at home, too.
You're playing with the wrong club.
It doesn't look like a Louisville Slugger.
I would have done NASCAR but we haven't invented the wheel yet.
Listen wise-guy, the strike zone is not between your knuckles and your knees.
Good to see baseball return to its roots
Sliding is going to suck in that dress
Yes it's good for catching food, but the rules say standard size.
Let me guess: you’re gonna hit it back to the Stone Age.
Remember, while it's in the air.
Just don't hurl your 'Neanderthal Slugger' when you strike out.
You don't happen to know a guy named Flintstone? He played for the Rockies.
You play for a baseball 'club'. You hit with a baseball bat.
Do you slide feet first in that?
This time hit the ball, not the pitcher.
Baseball?  It's so easy, even a caveman can do it!
Your Leopard Print from last time looked better
I've been in a slump since the Stone Age.
Did they call you up from the Jurassic league?
So, you're the designated hunter?
Neanderthals win games; Cro-magnons win championships.
So... you're the one they call  Yabba Dabba Doo...
The other team might have an issue with that bat
Why the ball?
So, is hatred of the Red Sox really primordial?
I promise there is no cork in this
Now batting for Rodriguez, number 7, Cro-Magnon
It feels like an eon since our last out.
Your game hasn't  evolved much since your rookie season.
C’mon George, don’t you think your taking this throwback jersey thing a little far?
Teddy Roosevelt I presume.
Now batting for Old Timers Day...
I think this designated hitter rule has gone too far.
Watch out for his knuckle dragger.
The rules only say "Bat".
Sorry, wrong sport.  The Alley Oop is football
I wish we did casual Fridays.
You know you’re supposed to hit the ball, right?
No! Who’s the name of the guy on first. What’s on second.
Our team has reached the salary cap'
You forgot your shoes
If you promise not to hit me I will call for a walk.
Watch out. this pitcher is a real Neanderthal.
Get with the times,man. We use aluminum bats now.
You're up next, the Neanderthal just struck out.
Shoeless Joe. Welcome back to oldtimers’ Day.
I just don't think the shift and analytics have a place in baseball
The game's changed a lot since you started, hasn't it?
You just get called up?
These throwback uniforms play tribute to the Mets' prehistory.
I’m the player to be named later.
There has been some rules added since the last time you played
Finally called you up from Triple-A.D., huh?
You misunderstand what we mean by club.
Remember, go for the ball, not for the guy.
Uhmm unga bunga buga buga?

It’s alright dude, I speak english. I just dress like this for the gram.
Not much has changed really. People still love you if you hit a big one!
Pine tar goes on your club, not your jersey.”
A bigger bat doesn't mean a bigger strike zone!
Hit a grounder.  I want to watch you run to first in that thing.
We really shouldn’t use the Electoral College to pick who plays in the All-Star Game.
Let me guess.  The bunt sign's not on?
Don't you just love these old-timers' games?
There’ve been some changes since you called “time out.”
Just my opinion, but I think your team has taken the retro look a little too far.
Hey clubber, clubber! Hey clubber, clubber! No clubber! No clubber!
Same old shit, bro - waiting for the kill.
I don’t care what the rules were in 20,000 B.C., big guy. Now it’s three strikes and you’re out.
Hi Donald. When did you get traded to the Republicans?
One more curve ball and you lose a finger.
Hey batta, batta, Evolve, batta, batta!
Please remember if you have to slide we have a PG audience.
Any word yet on those doping charges?
Took me a while to get to the big leagues too.
Can you count to three? That's all you need to do is count to three.
America's pastime not past time
Just visualize a mammoth's testicle - swing for all you're worth, then run like Hell !
Pretend it's a pigeon!
You do know it's the ball you have to hit?
They're going to make you pee into a cup first.
NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE!
Yeah, he throws mean a knuckle-dragger ball.
Don't freeze up again, Carl.
Great throwback uniform.
Dont'cha think this retro-look uniform thing has gone too far?
So I heard you were in the minors for the last three million years.
Ahh, so you’re the Neanderthal to be named later.
It's how you use it that counts.
Even your mother knows you're going to bunt.
For a guy drafted on a jaw fragment and part of a femur you're lucky to even be in the lineup.
When they said they were looking for a player 
with some experience ...
They thawed out another one, George.
If you are going to use that thing, remember to speak softly.
You forgot to grab a batting helmet.
Catcher: "Finally got the call to the big leagues?"
Batter: "It's been a long time coming!"
Wait till you see his curve stone.
You live in the dugout?
Helmet, Man, Helmet!
OK, then, dugout man.
Me swing.  Me hit home run.  Me get paid ten million clam shells.  Me retire in Key Biscayne.  Me buy new cave with in ground pool.
Take it easy, buddy. You're playing like a bunch of Neanderthals.
You wearing a cup under that pelt?
You might want to move back a bit - I sometimes throw the bat a little.
Paleo Diet been working for you?
Called up from the pre-farm system, eh?
That may have worked in Lascaux, but this is the major leagues, pal.
You've never heard of me? What, have you been living in a cave?
Manager tell Glonk must knock ball out of park.
He takes an old-school approach to the game.
You really should cut down on the steroids Gronk
Well that's a coincidence, because he calls his best pitch his Alley Oop.
I know facial hair is big in baseball now,  but this is ridiculous.
Didn't you strike out 40,000 years ago?
Gonna knock one back to the Stone Age this time, whiffer boy?
I got it from the clubhouse, why?
Which archaeologist scouted you?
The dugout must feel just like home.
Don't take it personally, but my wife keeps saying baseball is an old man's game and I'm starting to realize she might have a point.
So what did you do before the designated hitter rule?
Suit yourself, but you try sliding into second and you'll find yourself having quite a wardrobe malfunction.
Hey... didn't you play for the Dodgers before they moved to L.A.?
I gotta say, your home run last night was truly mammoth
I told you to go look for the Cubs, not clubs.
Just remember to slide head-first, buddy.
For distance I might go with a lighter club.
Throwback uniforms are getting ridiculous.
We don't have designated hunters in this league.
Your bat has pine tar on it. It’s illegal. You can’t use it!
Mr. Teebow, it's 2050, how long have you been stuck in the minors?
These throwback uniform nights are getting old. Really old.
Sure the game has evolved, but hitting is timeless.
No one's asking you to put the "L" in Cubs.
No collusion.
Hey, you throw back; me throwback,
Exactly how many steroids did you take?
Found it in the bat cave.
Huh. Thorg learn how stand upright eons ago.
Same stuff as always, nothing new
You should've seen last week's game against the renaissance men
It's deja vu all over again
You have one of those multi-year contracts?
Remember, you are going for RBIs, not RIBs.
I think you should know, I have an anger management problem.
Oh, so were playing the old rules."
You're the designated WHAT?
He called me off the bench.  I hope the rules haven't changed much.
Remember three strikes and you're extinct... Now play ball!
Me no understand why one need mask to poop?
No, you don't get to actually kill the umpire.
Back from retirement?
Pull out all the stops to break that the slump!
They said you could JOIN the club, not use the club.
How do you like the paleo diet?
One more time Ugg. He throw, you hit. You miss, I catch.
Man, you gotta ease up on that caveman diet.
Are you the dude who hits them back to the Stone Age?
And up at the plate now is GRRRRGHFN! Did I say that right?
It don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing.
Yeah, I think the whole "throwback player" thing has just jumped the shark.
So the rumors are true, you do carry a big stick.
Someday they'll call both of us traditionalists.
So great that you could make it for the old-timer's game.
So, you want to go out clubbing after this?
That apple you just ate was the last baseball. Head for home.
You Cleveland guys really take throw-back Tuesdays seriously.
Sorry, that isn't supposed to leave the clubhouse.
This is why I hate the pinch hitter rule!
You guys must have a great clubhouse.
Nice pedicure.
Wait a minute, isn’t that a mastodon femur?
As designated hitter you hit the ball, not me.
Now batting cleanup…Ted Flintstone.
No "Knock-um head pretty girl, make donk-donk;" that comes after a batting average of at least .350 and a multimillion, multi-year contract.
And I'M saying you didn't invent it!
Kickin it old school, I see
Standing upright was an improvement for Home erectus, but he never got used to the expanded strike zone.
After going 0 for 26 last week, I shaved mine.
Trust me. Pine tar's the last thing you should be worried about.
That's fine, just don't kneel for the anthem.
We still hit against the shift.
I hear Nike dropped you as a sponsor.
If you sling that bat at me, I'm tackling you at first, Ug.
Remember, if the 3rd base coach starts drawing pictures of aliens on the left field wall, that's the sign to bunt.
Why you hide brow ridge behind mask?
Now when the ball comes at you, hit it, don't catch it and eat it.
If you ever want to be a Yankee, you better get rid of that beard.
Dude you need to cut back on the PED's
Oh alright, you were safe.
If I hit it out of the state, how many extra runs is that?
'Stand for anthem' or what?
If you ain't wearin' tighty whitey's, skip the slide home.
I'll explain it one more time.  You're ON a baseball club.
When you told me about your baseball club I thought you meant your team
Guess you've spent quite a while in the minors.
Strike?
You're lucky. They won't let us grow beards.
Alright, I'm a gatherer. I was really hoping we had put that behind us.
You know La Brea pine tar is illegal, right?
Beer after the game?
This is nuts even for the Orioles.
Welcome to the club.
If you strike out, you can't kill the ump.
Me corked bat.
To  be honest, it doesn't  matter what he pitches, I am going to kill it.
So can you save me 15% on my car insurance?
I've got some ideas about speeding up the game.
Been waiting a long time, have you?
I thought we were going clubbing
Of course it's regulation. Why?
We only hit balls. Can you handle that?
Management made you wear your throwback outfit again, huh.
Your swing has really evolved.
In my day we didn't bunt.
Yeh, well, I'm not a fan of interleague play either.
Krog no need batting helmet.
I guess this puts to rest the legend that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839.
They said they’d LET you steal second this time so long as you promise not to slide.
But what's wrong with calling it a cave run?
Let's see if you can hit it straight back to the Stone Age.
Didn't you hit one over the fence at Jurassic Park?
What's with the squatting and the funny mask? How primitive!
Is that corked?
The rally beard just wasn’t enough huh?
Just pretend it’s a ptarmigan.
I'm a bit concerned that you may have misunderstood what I meant by "Strike!"
We seriously need more accurate drug tests
Alright, let's see you knock it out of the Jurassic Park!
I hate these retro promotions.
I said, you should play with our baseball club.....not, play baseball with a club
I Know you waited ages to be in the line-up !
I see you're back on the steroids.
Don’t you ever get tired of playing with the same old ball club?
Whadayya mean I need cleats!
So, you're America's real past time, eh?
You know, the ball? The round thing, like a wheel? Oh.
If you're going to go paleo, you have to fully embrace it, you know
Did you just get called up?
When he said, 'You're out!', he didn't mean we know you're a caveman.
Can you believe, I finally passed the drug test?
No, I'm not trying to take away your Second Amendment rights.
It's like the wheel. Only three-dimensional and it flies.
Hey, you need a helmet... AND shoes... AND pants...
Geez, Rick. Don’t you think you’re taking the paleo diet thing a bit far?
It's my first start with this club.
Because I don't need two hands!
Is that a whole cork branch?
Watch out for his knuckle-dragger-ball.
I thought millennials weren't into baseball!
Why yes, the pitchers mound is a stones throw away
Sorry, you can't hunt and gather until the seventh-inning stretch.
No, hitting this guy is NOT so easy a caveman can do it.
Yeah, sure, Cher’s “Believe” is a great choice for a walk up song.
I thought retro night meant something else entirely.
I think you took the throwback uniform idea too far.
Is that really a vintage Louisville slugger ?
Remember, the scouts only care about your launch angle.
You must be a New Yorker.
Time to cast the first stone.
That's not what BYOB means.
I was told to swing for the lights.  What are lights?
No, strike doesn't mean clobber.
The designated hitter will be extinct before you know it.
Now would be a good time to invent an umpire.
Well, well, if it isn't Bamm Bamm Rubble all grow'd up.
I get the extinct feeling everybody's watching me.
You swing at the ball, not me.
Yabba Dabba Doo!
Throw back uniform?
That’s a heck of a throwback uniform.
Geeeez! Where'd the scouts dig you up?
That's funny; where we come from, home plate is still a circle.
No, not much has changed....They throw something at you -- your days a rock, nowadays it's a hard-ball -- and then you hit the thing back at them in a way that makes it impossible for them to catch the thing.
This game is definitely going down in history.
I haven't seen a swing like that in ages.
Is this what he meant by "Make America Great Again?"
No, you don't get the girl by hitting me!
Is that a regulation club?
I'd get farther back,if I were you.
How's that 30,000-year option working out?
I'm a Detroit tiger not a saber tooth tiger.
So you’re the first, first draft pick huh?
Well, at least you won't be sliding in spikes up.
It's a Louisville Clubber
Now,remember,Gnork,keep your eye on the ball,not the head. Ball,not head.
I bet you can't bunt!
Watch your toes--he throws a wicked sinker.
You passed the drug test?
Are you sure you can run in that?
It's good to see you again Mark McGuire. I guess since you had to give up steroids, you moved on to the paleo diet.
Just up from the Cro-Magnon League?
You wanna go clubbing after this?
So,  how long were you with the Troglodytes farm team before being called up
Hold your pelt when you slide, ok?
Nice throwback jersey.
Why, yes! I opted not to circumcise, too. Good eye!
Wow, the shift is really changing the game.
Do you think the game needs to be shortened?
You gotta stop using that Neanderthal growth hormone.  You're gonna get caught.
I’ve seen better bats in a cave. Oh, sorry.
You here to play Neander-ball?
Been in the dugout a while, eh?
Grok! You’re finally out of the minors.
You know the fans are right. Baseball games are really too long.
Hey what was your average last year?
Evolution is overrated.
Yes, I get paid to squat down like this and catch small white balls. What do you do for a living?
Do me a favor.  Be careful where you toss that thing.
I don't like the designated hitter rule either.
Bitching throwback jersey.
So the Mariners still haven’t made it to the World Series?
Just a jock strap, but  then I'm not a catcher.
If you’re hunting for home plate you’ve found it.
You guys are taking this throwback uniform day too far.
The game has evolved since you last played.
You really have gone all-in on the Paleo diet.
What are you looking at? All the other batters have beards!
Your outfit isn't like the rest of your team either.
Me catch, you swing.
You'll begin to notice that your game evolves at this level.
I wish coaches would stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
OK Rocky, you swing at the ball, not me.
We're not caving in just yet!
I think your bat has too much tar on it.
So easy, that a caveman can do it.
I'm not doing what you think I'm doing.
You never know who will suit up for the Mets after the trade deadline
I see you're new to the club.
Without the designated hitter rule, I would have retired years ago.
I don't think I can catch a rock going a hundred miles an hour...
Sorry you lost that Geico endorsement deal,  but I hear Papa John's is looking for a new spokesman.
Finally, a plan to capture millennials!
No Sir , this is not your game
Fear the beard.
You spend a very long time  in the minors?
Just watch the backswing. huh, Roc?
This is a ball park, not Jurassic Park
If I Strike Out, You're Next.
Knuckleballer, not knuckle-dragger!
Are you the owner?
That bat is non-regulation, Og.
no, you can’t play. Clubbing your wife is only ok in football.
You did ask me to tell you when you're being inappropriate.
Is this where I stand?  I'm a Neanderthal at this game.
I think that might be an illegal bat.
You can't use that! I don't care what the original regulations were!
You'll need to think of the strike zone a little differently...
Your team's throwback uniforms are a bit overboard.
Unga bunga to you too, pal.
Yogi Cave Berra I presume?
We've got just the pitcher for you... his ERA is 150,000 BC.
When they shouted  KILL THE UMPIRE, they didn’t mean it literally.
The umps are OK with my bat but the Yankees still won't allow facial hair.
Just saying, the plate is shiny.
Do you know Barney Rubble?
Please keep your legs crossed if you slide into home.
I hate dinosaur bobblehead night.
that better not be a cork bat
I sacrifice fly, then sacrifice ump.
I’ll bet that dugout seems like a big step up from that cave you crawled out of.
You again??  It's  Fenway, not Jurassic!!
I'm from the Trump farm team.
Just don't throw your bat.
Now I know why they say there is no clock in baseball!
Softball my ass, you bunch of pussies. Back in my day we hit rocks.
The bat I get, but that dress'll be hell to slide in.
What do you mean Abner Doubleday didn't invent baseball?
WITH THAT BAT EVEN I COULD HIT 70 HOME RUNS.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT A CLUB??
You really are from the bush leagues.
Oh yeah ... he's throwing heat.
But then, what do you know about fire?
This time aim for the ball and not my head!
People say I'm the life of the party.
So you actually are a bunch of Neanderthals.
You do realize, of course, that a strike doesn't mean what you might think it means?
You forgot your helmet.
When did you get called up from Single A?
Name is Chuck. Just got called up from the La Brea Sabre Tooth’s AAA.
Wow.  I thought my ten years to make it to the ‘’Bigs” was an eternity.
Originally, baseball was called "club it".
I can see you are giving me the finger!
From Hoboken, I take it?
No, no that's fine with me. You can call me a "gatherer".
You're laughing now, but I'm about to hit one for the ages.
Baseball club
Extinction is not that bad, really. You get used to it after a while.
It's our new throwback jersey.
I can't. hear you, you're speaking too softly
So you think Roy Hobbs was too old to swing a club?
Going way back for throwback night, huh?
Called back from retirement?
It so easy a caveman can do it.
Took 15,000 years, but you're finally in the Big Show
If you hit the ball, a pterodactyl will eat your baby.
I was in the minor leagues for a very long tine.
You definitely smell like foul balls.
This is your first " Old Timers " game?
It’s called a plate.
Yabba Dabba Strike 2!
Charlestown Cavemen.....good name.
Sorry, pal. The old timers' game was yesterday.
There's no Cro-Magnon in Baseball.
That bat is illegal!
You say 'yaba-daba-do' one more time I club you.
I asksed for a plate at the buffet and I can't figure out why they sent me out here.
It's our pastime,not your past time!
So this is what they really meant when they said "watch out when you play against that club"
Hello, plate.”
Face it! If they didn't allow designated hitters, you'd be out of baseball!
One last time; not me- the ball!
Nice pelt.  Want another?
I thought you were out about 20,000 years ago.
Hey man, you’re taking this hipster thing a little too far.
Yeah, you're changing the game, but you're not helping it evolve!
I’ll show you Pinstripes how it’s done.
This Paleo diet craze is ruining the game.
Better not be any La Brea Tar on your club.
Club rules
You're being way too literal for Old-Timers Day.
Clubs are for golf, man.
Rules state you need a cup.
I'm pinch hitting for "The Natural."
Smelling good big boy - are you wearing Brut?
Say, is that your woolly mammoth in the parking lot?
3,547,243 hits, eh? 
That's probably one record that never will be broken.
This is how it works. The pitcher is going to throw baseballs at your club, trying to hit it.  Your job is to swing wildly, making him miss it.”
...I said, "Stand for the National Anthem!"
This guy throws fire.
No jockstrap, huh?
Jeez! How long did they keep you in the dugout?
You just lost.  Have you been living in a cave?
Just what farm team did you say you played for?
Wow! Wade Boggs! when did you come out of retirement?
So wait, let me get this straight. I don’t hit you in the head. Some guy throws a head at me and I hit it?
It may be none of my business, but aren't you taking this paleo diet a bit too far?
First, you hit the round thing like it’s dinner, and then you run like a sabertooth tiger.
I'm glad they changed us from the Redskins and all, I just miss shoes.
It’s called playing the long game.
I'm 'Neandering' up to the plate.
Whatever you do, don't slide into second base.
You'll do fine, he's throwing rocks.
You from the Pro-Magnon League?
The only reason that bat is legal is because 
you contributed DNA to 6% of the ump's genome.
But can you eat it?
Caveman hungry, so when you going to buy me some peanuts and CrackerJacks?
Really? Up 'til now I'd always believed that baseball was invented by Russians.
When they said this was America's Greatest Pastime - they weren't kidding.
It's so easy even a caveman can do it.
Hi there!  If there's a bench clearing brawl, just want you to know, I'm an incredibly amicable person.
You're gonna need a bigger mitt.
Watch out for his fast boulder.
The whole "fire" thing was starting to get a little boring.
OK.  Yes, I can see it your way.
No hunter-gathering until the seventh-inning stretch.
You're really committed to this 'beard look,' Dombrowski.
Frictional unemployment
Let me guess, the lumberjack look just wasn’t manly enough?
No I don’t chew tobacco, I’m not a Neanderthal!
You've got no balls, man.
It’s  not in your DNA.
It all started when a disgruntled fan tweeted management that “Any dumb cave man could out hit your entire  team.”
Dude, you know you’re supposed to hit the ball with that thing.
It sure looks performance-enhancing to me.
Congrats on the Fruity Pebbles cereal box cover.
What, No Helmet?
You know batting helmets have been required since 1970. That may be 6720 in your parlance.
You do know how this works, right?
So it's okay to hit one out the park.
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack, I won't care if I never get back.
Coconut or Cantaloupe ?
I'm jealous of you guys that were grandfathered in.
Back ‘em up, fellas. This guy’s got a Louisville Clubber.
I thought these rule changes set the game back a few years, but this is ridiculous.
One rock, two strikes"
Just you wait - our bullpen has a knuckle-baller you CAN'T hit.
You don't need a bat that big; you're facing the Mets bullpen.
One fireball please.
Well, you're taking throwback uniforms to a new level.
Don't worry, they used to call my equipment 'The tools of ignorance.'
Fastball inside. Shame you’re pre-verbal.
Heck of a streak you're on. You haven't changed uniforms in how long?
We thought "everyone does playoff beards"...
So, when did you decide to turn Pro-Magnon?
I hate game delays too but when an umpire calls a strike next time, don't club him.
Red Sox - ya finally got uniforms to match the beards.
Haven't I seen you in the clubhouse?
They say you're a mammoth striker...
If you think the DH rule is silly, wait until you get caught by the Infield Fly rule.
I use whatever bat I want, pig face."
What do you mean, where's first base?
You built it. So I came by. Who were you expecting?
Your wife still got that bone in her lip?
Give new meaning to the term "baseball club"
Ok, so you play with a big club!
I'm thinking, "intentional walk".
Well, actually we did stop using boulders a while ago, not so much because of the casualty count as what a nightmare they were to autograph!
I like to walk softly and carry a big stick!
Coach wanted us to get back to basics...
You know what the 'ball' is, right? That's the only thing you're allowed to hit.
Whatta mean pine tar, that’s Yak blood
Uhmmmm, I think he said, 'Bunt' not 'Hunt'  !!
What? They said baseball club.
I heard you bought a new place with a helluva man cave.
If you hit this one, you'll make history.
Here comes the fast ball.  You're welcome.
Stick to the American League when you hit free agency. The National League doesn't allow the designated crusher.
Yup, it's still three strikes and you're out.
So, you made it to the big club.
How long did you say you spent in AAA?
Does it wick sweat as well as they say?
Why isn’t the New Yorker funny anymore?
Remember, I only catch the ball. The pitcher is the one to take out your frustrations on.
In his later years, bam bam found minor success as a pitch hitter in the MLB
I won't be bunting.
No, it isn't a Louisville Slugger. It came from a T-Rex; I thought that would be obvious.
It's the Cubs, not Clubs!
Exactly how long were you in the minors?
I know baseball is a very old game, but this is ridiculous!
of course I'm scared.
I just came up from the Miocene League.
I get it with the bat but you’re telling me the Rules Committee approved the off-the-shoulder uniform too?
Speaking softly, I see.
Man, I heard you guys have a deep bench, but not this deep!
No, seriously, the pitchers used to bat for themselves.
My guess is that you are not going to bunt.
You're never gonna catch up to his fastball with that.
Bet you thought you’d never get called up!
Okay guys, I know he struck out last at bat but remember--he's evolved a lot since then.
Welcome to the Big Leagues, pal. Just relax. I know you been thinkin' about this swing for a million years. And your wife just yelled that you'd never get to first base. Don't cave, man.
Our pitcher is on fire ... not that you'd know what that is.
It’s smaller than a brontosaurus egg.
whatchu say about my momma?
Before there were teams, we had clubs.
You just make the club?
Looks like we're gonna need a bigger ball.
I understand your hitting game has evolved.
Ted, it’s over now.  Carol chose me.
Forget your spikes?
Well, since the Geico commercials and sitcom spin-off, I've been trying to cover all my bases.
I don't care if you did invent fire, step in the box.
Throw back is not meant to insult you.
This is a curve ball I wasn't anticipating.
Wanna go clubbing after the game?
There’s no clubbing in baseball.
Bobby's in school but the two year old is home driving Maria crazy.
I heard that your team is anti-analytics, but you guys are more old school than I thought.
No. This is Fenway Park. Jurassic Park is playing down the street."
When I was little, I wanted to be a hunter-gatherer.
Let's hope he doesn't misinterpret the hit and run sign.
Me not use regulation bat, but all the people here love me, so your rules don't count.
OK, we're trying to be inclusive here.  Your bat's approved and we've   wrapped the rock in sabertooth skin.  But, we can't waive the helmet rule.
100,000 years between pitches is quicker than the last batter.
These Retro Night promotions are getting out of hand.
When the man behind me yelled ball three, he was not making fun of you.
No gloves?
It's pronounced Neander-thal.
You promise not to swing that thing and I'll promise not to spike your stupid feet.
This time try hitting the ball instead of the pitcher.
The steroids don't help with the swollen ankles?
I’ve been waiting years for this
I was just recalled from the Mesozoic
No, they moved to L.A. in '58.'
The ump says he doesn't care if you just escaped from from a dinosaur by coming forward from the past and walked over from La Brea, you're out for excessive tar on your bat.
R.B.C., 'Runs before Christ'.
You dress like that, and the pitcher will throw stones.
No it's not an ostrich egg; next time don't eat, hit it!"
Not sweat, even a caveman can do it.
You BOUGHT the club?
Just give me the sign and we won't have any problems. Okay?
Let me guess, you hold the record for most at bats.
How's the backswing on that thing?
So, let me get this straight: you’re here with me and Steve is currently fighting a tyrannosaurus with a baseball bat?
so, how's the new club working out for ya?
How do we know your club's not corked?
I started with the Giants in New York.
You must be in some slump."
I am not going to block your slide this time.
I just think comparing yourself to Jackie Robinson is a bit of a stretch.
It's called "Remembrance of Things Past".  You should read it some time.
My bat and appearance may be off-putting, but can’t you fix the position of the plate, move back of my swing path and explain how you keep your balance like that?
Yeah......no.  I actually don’t think you should bunt.
The world's other "oldest profession".
Old Timers Day again.
No - clubbing me on the head does not constitute a 'hit' in baseball.
Neanderville Slugger
You forgot your cleats, again.
I think you misunderstood me when I said hit it back to the Stone Age
You're supposed to hit the ball, Neanderthal!
Designated Neanderthal
I think you overdid it on the Paleo diet.
We call him Early Man around here because he swings too soon
Strike" is not a command
You're out. Done. It's over. Cro-Magnon won.
Just pretend it's prey when it comes at you.
Wanna see why they call it ‘slugging percentage?’
I hope they don’t throw me out for having the pine tar too high...
Ok Og, just remember, a called strike doesn't mean you can hit me.
I'm literally gonna hit this ball into the Stone Age.
Watch me hit the next one back to the stone age.
You lookin' for meat? We'll serve you up a slider.
Are you sure that's no more than 2 3/4 inches in diameter?
Another asterisk for the record books.
In this case, batter is a noun not a verb.
You been juicin’ again, Rubble?
That bat better not be corked.
One more strike out and it's back to hunting and gathering
Designated by who, Barney Rubble?
I don’t care if your diet is paleo. Your uniform still isn’t regulation.
I think you've taken that paleo thing too far.
I thought, "getting knocked back to the Stone Age..." was just an expression.
Pinstripes, are those still in?
Not my favorite throwback uniform.
So, Barney, tell me … how long were you in Triple-A?
I was told this was a club team.
You're the Mascot and the Center Fielder?
How do you like the 84 oz. bat?
Up next, Designated Hitter Ned Anderthal!
No I am not illegal. I was given a green card due to my outstanding skill in clubbing.
Long stint in the minors?
Is that glove regulation?
You must be the Pleistocene Hammer we’ve heard so much about
Next up, Homo Erectus! Looks like he is bringing the heat tonight folks.
Doing the full Paleo?
Just hit the ball. You don't have to hunt or gather it.
I guess they were serious about getting you up here with the big club.
The hard part is the domestic violence policy
ball club
Holy crap, please don’t kill me.
Don’t you think you’re taking this Paleo diet a little far Joe?
That’s not what Coach meant when he said we have to get back to basics.
You must be their new switch hitter. That's some switch!
Finally!! I’ve been in the dugout a long, long time.
Can you tell I’m wearing spanks?
It’s a mastodon leg bone.
Saber-tooth-tiger-metrics has really changed the game.
Everyone's about those retro uniforms, hey?
No helmet?
I wouldn't be squatting so close to home plate if I were you.
You’ve heard of the Louisville Slugger, well this is the Bedrock Slugger.
Shouldn't you be in the clubhouse?
'Didn't you used to play for the Red Sox?'
This is going to be a little faster than what you're used to!
I know this is "Old Timer's Day", but this is ridiculous.
I'm fine with the new uniform and no shoes, but the bat has to go.
So, what's next?
I said I was good at hitting, but this is a whole new ball game.
No, no! Hit the ball--not the guy!
You're not supposed to look at me.
I'm the one that was to be announced later.
What are you waiting for — a knuckledragger ball?
Who are you wearing?  Let me guess.  Wilma?
I beat you to pulp
The old-timers’ game isn’t until next week.
Hey man, I think you got that man cave thing backwards.
I thought throwback uniform night was tomorrow?!
And I thought Clemens was old...
Batting cleanup for the Washington Neanderthals and using his own club is Justice Goneawr
Although his on-base percentage was terrible, Moog usually ended up hitting 'something' during his at bats.
I know it's "Old Timer's Day", but how old?
It's Babe Ruthless.  What's it to you?
How many innings is this going to take?
They are going a little too far with these throwback uniforms.
Nice ball club.
So how long were you on the DL?
No, there are no women on my team either.
If you've been embracing Paleo only as a diet, boy, you really are just not unlocking your full potential
I think you took the Paleo Diet to the extreme!
I guess you don't have to wear a batting helmet.
We're going to crush you.  Where do you keep the women?
It will be about 1 million years until you get out of your slump.
Not me, the round thing.
Sweet walk-up music... Theme from 2001 is a solid choice.
I can’t wait to tell my kids I met the bat’s inventor.
Wow!  I thought "Neanderthals" was just the team name!
You were NOT supposed to eat it!
Frozen how long? Wow. No, actually, the game hasn't evolved much.
It's your lucky day. The ump is a total Neanderthal.
Geez, enough with the steroids already!
Fair warning–he throws a mean curve rock.
We call them dugouts. But hey, if you say cave I'm fine with that!"
(catcher signal) ‘knuckle-dragger ball’
Speak softly, I get it. Speak at all?
You're taking too many steroids.
I wish you mascots would learn your place!
The umpire's hiding in the restroom
What do you mean mammoths were still alive when this game started?
Where is your batting helmet?  Have you been living in a cave
This old thing? Nike of course.
I didnt recive a uniform
Three more rocks and you walk to first base.
Are you sure I’m supposed to hit the ball? We usually hit heads with this.
The key to a successful hitter is not to overthink.
You can save me how much?
They said they were bring you over from another club...
I'm the designated caveman.  Want to make something of it?
I don't think the beard and the long hair are the problem.
what would happen if I hit you out of the park?
I hate these Old-Timers' games.
Wow, this really is Old Timers Day.
Sorry Grork, that's not what we meant by club sport.
You're off to a rocky start, Bam-Bam.
Think you’re taking the Paleo thing a bit far, Bruce?
Are you wearing the Philly Phanatic's fur?
What glacier did you melt out of?
You're the designated hitter?  I thought you were the mascot.
Our manager only allows the beard.
You gotta drop this attitude. It's not like you're the first Neanderthal to ever make it into American sports, you know.
Well, I cant read or write but I sure can hit!
Don't swing.  Just hold it up high and look like you will. The law of averages is on your side.
You been with my wife?
Uck throw ball, you hit ball... got it? Play Ball!
Sorry, this plate doesn't have food.
At bat, the original Louisville Slugger.
Yes, I do feel like this game is taking forever.
Try calling me out.
One strike.  You're out.
This could be your comeback season!
Two men on, top of the Paleolithic.
He sees you're not wearing a helmet he'll go for your head!
It’s ‘America’s Pasttime’—have you heard of America?
Steroids? God NO! But this Paleo diet seems to have its own side effects!
Pal, you gotta look the other way!
Archaeologists found him in a dugout.
Personally, I think the league is going a little overboard with the retro uniforms.
How's the wife?
We're gonna need bigger balls!
You must be that old school player we’ve heard about.
High and inside? Not a chance!
No, man. You hit the ball, you don't eat it.
I don't believe they were referring  to baseball when they said , it's so easy a caveman could do it"
Yo Fred....Your bat smells like the La Brea Tar Pit.
Why yes, Roger Clemens is my father. How did you know?
Is that a bat out of hell?
Remember, if you take a base, no knuckle dragging allowed.
Even the UMPIRE can see you were out clubbing all night!
Ballclub. Literally.
So how’s the wife and kids ?
You people crazy, why hit little object already dead and call it "big game."
Been riding the pine awhile?
First they let us grow beards, then the whole Yankee culture regressed.
I've been playing this sport since before you were born, son.
So you are the phenom they call Troglodyte.
You couldn't hit the ground if you fell off your woolly mammoth!
I haven't seen you since the La Brea Tar Pits Game.
Some day you'll understand what 3 and 2 means.
This paleo diet coach put me on has really gotten out of hand.
I hate ‘throwback’ jersey night too.
Wow, you actually look the way that you smell.
I must say it's refreshing to see a guy come up to hit with no batting gloves and arm padding.
I don't suppose you are going to bunt.
Yeah, we all have playoff beards.
I don't care who you voted for. Play ball.
These throwback uniforms are really getting out of control.
We're not gonna have another La Brea tar incident, are we?
I remain concerned with the evolution of the game.
When I was growing up there was no such thing as 'sexual assault'.
I see you haven't played in a long time...
I see your ERA is Neolithic.
Back from the Bush League, I see.
Farm team? No, they called me up from the hunter and gatherer team.
And now, pinching hitting for Og,  . .
Last thing I remember is a rounded second and felt really cold.
I hate turn back the clock night.
My agent's crunched the numbers. It appeals to the right marketing demographic.
Didn't you used to play with the Tigers?
Throwback uniform day is next week, Harry!
I know that's you Sammy - the corked bat gives it away.
Ha, you'll be out if I strike you once!
Who are you calling a knuckleball?
Rule #1: You hit the ball,  not me!
I just got called up.  I spent a LOT of time in the minors.
Watch out. He’s a head hunter too.
Maybe these games are getting to be too long.
SO YOU SAY YOUR 18 AND YOUR'RE FROM RUSSIA?
Watch out.  This pitcher throws a mammoth fast ball.
I thought you retired...
Shoeless Joe, is that really you?
Walk softly
Where I come from, the curve ball hasn’t been invented yet.
When I heard that your team was switching to new uniforms, this is the last thing I would have expected.
No offense, but bringing back the old Hall O’ Famers is NOT going to boost ratings.
Let's try an evolutionary curve...
Three squares, two big sticks. Full count.
Uh, this time try to remember "Ogg hit ball, not Catcher!"
Don't worry, at our rate of play it'll be the bronze age by the 9th inning.
Don't look at me that way.  I eat what I bat.
How much time did you spend in the minors?
Not even you can hit the anachronistic curveball... good luck.
He throw chin music, you feel pain from club. Comprende?
So, what's your idea to speed up the game?
Yeah, you just watch the ball go by three times...
Hey, I haven’t seen you in ages, how is Pebbles and Bam-Bam?
Sure, it’s certified. It’s a B.C. Slugger.
Who said you could use the practice bat?
It looks like a house, "Home" plate?... Yeah...nevermind.
No! We're a baseball "club". Use a bat like everyone else.
I hate throwback uniform night.
I gotta hand it to you Saber Tooth Ball 
Cats . You really went old school with your new uniforms
Laugh, but you don't know my stats in the Neander Valley League.
Have you checked the rules on that?
Too much pine tar?
Old timers day has gone to far.
Finally got called up to the majors?
Remember, Grog.  If you strike out, go to the dugout, not the pitcher's mound.
No, my head is NOT in the strike zone.
You Org, Me Ump
That mask won’t help in this fight, believe me.
No..no. BATTING. You start batting. No battering.
I am the designated cave man.
They told me you were up with the big club
Yeah pal, hit it back to the Stone Age.
Bunter and Gatherer
The maple club is fine, but you still have to wear a batting helmet.
I guess you won't be bunting.
And who are you supposed to be, Shoeless Joe Jackson?
Hey, hold on. Didn’t I see you playing at the old-timers games this year?
I don’t think Mr Trump wants anybody kneeling anymore... get up!
I'm just moonlighting at this until I can upgrade my man cave.
The game has really evolved!
Truly America's past time.
Mr. Og, it's truly an honor to play alongside a veteran of the game such as yourself.
Hey, No Shirt No Shoes No Swings
The balls a little hairy so it works to your benefit
Of course you can You own the club.
Is that a sabre-toothed tiger on first base?
Just picture the face of a saber-toothed tiger on the ball.
No, we did not steal your mammoth.
Hey Rookie, glad you finally made the Show.
Some say the game is evolving. But I think it’s the same as it ever was.
Are you trying to prove that this is America's oldest sport?
No, you are not seeing things; I will be hitting the next pitch into the Stone Age.
I see you're using a Louisville Clobber.
I said "Join the club," not bring one!
I spent a long time in the minor leagues
When the man behind me yells, "Strike!" , do not hit me! 
Got it?
Let me guess,its Fred!
Nice bat. You certaintly won't have to worry about striking out as it's widewr than the plate.
Don't worry, the rules haven't changed much.
The Mets will try anything to sell tickets these days.
Just to make sure we're on the same page, you hit the ball, NOT the guy catching the ball.
Take it easy! It just means you’re one ball away from a walk.
Wow, that was quite a number you do on our mountain lion mascot.
You couldn't hit the side of a mammoth.
Are you sure that bat is legal?
Please try to hit the ball, not me.
We don’t need an ump—we haven’t invented the ball yet.
You have too much pine tar on your club.
So, your the Sultan of What from the Neanderthal  League!
They need to quit it with all these throwback jerseys.
Oh -- I forgot it's throwback jersey night.
I prefer pine tar but some of the old school guys still use the tar pits.
It's only an Old Timers Game. Just do your best.
And you’re telling me that’s not corked?
Home Run Hitter
So what if  my bat's not regulation. Do you want to make something out of it?
You must be part of the evolving rotation.
It's a beautiful night for baseball here at Jurrasic Park.
I'm not sure that's what they meant by old school.
So where is your helmet, buddy?
Just ask the dinosaurs, three strikes and your out.
No, you're IN a club, and that's a bat, but not that KIND of bat.
in my days we didn't wear armor
I thought you were traded to the Yankees!
Move it along, pal.  I don't have all epoch.
Remember, if you get a hit do not throw the bat this time.
No knuckle balls!
It's a rebuilding year.
What! We're getting sponsored by a paleo snack company this season.
So that's who the Dodgers traded to get Manny Machado.
Of course I've heard of Shoeless Joe Jackson.
It's like a wheel, only more 3D...Oh, never mind...
Sorry to hear it didn’t work out in Hollyrock with Pebbles.
The Great Bamm-Bamm-bino steps up to the plate.
Farm League or Hunter-Gatherer?
Not nearly as easy as GEICO.
Wow..did you know Babe Ruth?
I know it is you guys’ retro week, but I thought the Louisville Clubber was illegal.
I can’t wait to see my rookie card.
I think you got too much pine tar on that club.
Baseball bat,not baseball club
What do you mean, I need to where a batting helmet?
Just got called up from Bedrock, eh?
You’ve come a long way, dude, considering eighteen months ago you were part of a glacier.
Today, maul ball. Tomorrow, woolly mammoth.
Homer off Lefty’s curveball? So easy, even a caveman can do it, right?!
Been with the club for a long time?
When's the last time you made the playoffs?
This is the Majors, kid. If you don't stop crowding the plate, I'll signal him for another brushback, and I don't think you can handle it.
I'm just not sure it's regulation - any of it.
Enough with the “Flintstones” wisecracks. You are really dating yourself.
I was thinking of going 'paleo'  myself!
I'm assuming we can rule out a bunt.
And, now, batting third for the Mets ...
Just a heads up, Dave, your manager missed the point of throwback uniform day.
I assume those are your mammoth skins drying in left field?
I saw Herman Munster do this once.
So Redford's doing a remake of "The Natural"?
My agent suggested a big shtick.
What a surprise! I never dreamed they'd call you up.
Just up from the Asia Minors?
Not yet! The credit card commercial starts AFTER the game is over.
I’m the designated clubber.
They did tell me we were going to play against some 'mammoth sluggers'...
I'm not sure how I feel about the retro uniforms.
Show some respect, I'm a Pro-Magnon
You got panties on under that sack?
No, seriously dude, with a cranium like that you're gonna want a batting helmet.
I'm with the Clubs.
The ‘Green Monster’ isn’t literal, you know.
It's called Free Agency
It's called the designated hitter, not the designated hunter.
I thought by "paleo" you just meant eating more protein, Gary.
Here's the deal: you always swing that above my head, and I'll always call it a ball.
Come on it's so easy a caveman can do it.
This preseason keeps getting earlier and earlier!
A meditative pause as Thor contemplates the retirement of his jersey after his next home run.
Where are the women?
I don't care how many rocks have fallen on your head, you really should be wearing a helmet.
That thing better not be corked.
You signaled a 'curveball', didn't you?
Brings new meaning to the term Clubhouse.
Did you know they say we’re all at least two percent Neanderthal ?
My DNA test results say I’m 2.8% Neanderthal. Have any kin in Jersey?
As long as I keep hitting, the outfit is OK with management.
Still got the playoff beard? What’s it been, 7000 years?
The Cos Play event today was only for the fans.
Oh, I get it, Clan of the Bad News Cave Bears?
You mean the whole Neanderthal team doesn't where batting helmets? Haven't you read the latest reports on brain damage from concussions?
Let me guess.  You just came up from the Mets' farm team in Bedrock?
It's not all offense.  You need some gatherers.
Well this is a curveball.
This is one for the ages.
Carl, it was fun in the bedroom but not at work.
I remember the days before the designated hunter-gatherer
I want to warn you, this pitchers a headhunter and I mean that literally
Once I decided to grow the beard, the rest was easy.
I’m actually undercover for your team.
Yes, this is Fenway Park...and you are with the Yankees.
Didn't realize we were up against the Texas Rangers today.
No, Cubs is the name of the team!
Today's players have clearly evolved.
I've been at this a lot longer than you.
And now, for the inaugural ‘First Hit:’ the 45th President of the United States!
I hope that you have a high launch angle.
For what it's worth, I miss the Phoenician-ball era, too.
Where's your helmet?
Peeeeeyeew -- I know why you're not the clean-up batter.
I love retro uniform day.
No. If you hit it, you can not eat it, and if you miss, return to your cave.
And you, I'm venturing to guess, would be our designated hitter.
Hey, don't look at me - I just catch the ball.
It seems like this game has been going on for ages!
The growth hormones really aren't too subtle nowadays, are they.
I could stand erect too, but that would make catching kinda hard.
You guys went all out for ‘Retro Day’.
You know, Slugger is just a nickname?
God, I hate the playoffs.
I'm trying to get traded, myself.
Great throwback jersey -- we've always just had pinstripes.
You didn’t hear? It’s throwback jersey night.
You might want to start your swing a tad earlier.
Is this your first at club?
When the catcher said he wanted to go clubbing tonight, this is not what he had in mind.
Beards in baseball is so 2017.
I don't think bone bats are legal
Glad to see you're off the steroids.
I'm guessing that you aren't going to bunt.
Well just get used to it. You're not in the bush leagues anymore.
It probably doesn't matter, but you're facing the wrong way
You gotta retire at some point, Damon.
Sorry. You need a bat not a leg bone!
Look, the hat's not regulation, and that's all I'm gonna say about it.
I can’t count. Don’t worry.
Barney?
Fred?
Coach asked you to deal with the President’s opening pitch
So, I’m guessing you’re not a sabermetrics guy.
Hi Joe. Where you been?
Bush league ball club, eh?
Yup, we still call it home.
Just how low will the Red Sox go?
No shoes, no cap, no pitches.
Does that loincloth help prevent jock itch?
Helluva 'Throwback Night,' don't you think
I know this is a pro club team, but you still have to wear shoes.
You guys really take that "pastime" business seriously, huh?
Been in the minors a while?
I heard they dug up your old tweets about woolly mammoths being dumb.
Squint? check. Bat? check. Beard? check. Batter Up!
You have a point - the dugout is like a cave, but that's still not appropriate.
Yes......but can you run?
You must be on the paleo diet.
Bunt.
Could you carry it at least part way to first base?
It's called "the shift"....
Just look how far we've come, America's favorite pastime in the era of Make America GRATE Again.
Now you run the bases.
Now I see why your scouting report says "possesses evolving skillset but carries a big stick."
Anyone seen my batting helmet?
No more amber, okay?
It's simple,  just keep your eye on the  ball.
Take your time fielding boys, he's got no wheels!
Huh! I thought you guys only liked bowling.
Hey Brandon. Bill Veeck is qvelling in his grave.
That's one of those Neanderthal Sluggers, right?
I heard your team doesn't embrace advanced metrics.
Who you calling a bush leaguer?
So you're trying to hit the ball, right?
Happy Old Timers day. That bat better not be corked.
Hey, Ump, is that "Pine Tar" on his bat?"
I brought my own bat.
The Paleolithic Era is my second-favorite past time.
They just called me up from the Prehistoric League.
You look familiar.  Did you used to play with a different ball club?
Sorry, you’re out of your league here...
Love the retro uniform!
Don't call me, "Babe."
I read about your trade in a cave in France
You’re saying Abner Doubleday didn’t invent baseball?
You said you were a lefty.
How's the wife and troglodytes?
You're really taking this paleo diet too far!
Was the throwback uniform game today?
Aren't you taking this paleo thing a bit too seriously?
Hitting rock with stick seem a bit rudimentary don't you think?
Are you on the paleo diet?
That's taking "throwback" a little extreme, isn't it?
Looks Like You've Been In The Minors For Eons
Just got called up?
For some reason, I don't think you are going to bunt.
Even a caveman knows there should never have been a designated hitter rule.
Sorry! No shoes, no shirt . . . no service!!
Please don
So, how’s your wife and my kids?
That's not quite what we meant by BYOB, but I'm impressed by your spelling
Looks like you got your gear in the clubhouse.
Now I know why your nickname is Homer Erectus.
How do you swing a bat? It’s so easy even a caveman can do it.
No batting gloves--you're old school.
I said, watch for a curve ball, not a cave ball.
I always strike out, but not in the way you think.
Let's see if you can hit it outta the Jurassic.
I have great seats at the Opera after the game.
Sorry Dude.  NFL doesn't start until September.
Gosh, this guy's been playing forever!
How will you slide into first?
Ya, I’ve been with this club for a long time.
You can't be up, you're not on the roster. I don't care if you are the "missing link".
I'm trying to put a new twist on minor league clubs.
Me Grok, hate Red Sox!
You know you don’t need an actual club to get into the clubhouse...
What do I say? Clubber up?
In the Cave Leagues, catchers need a lot more equipment.
Hey buddy... I bet ya mother was a big hairy ape
This may just be sour grapes, but I sure hope "Jurassic World Series" 
is the final sequel in this  whole franchise.
Well now you're just grandstanding.
What do you mean it isn't regulation?  Who cares about regulations anymore?
They will talk about this game in pre-history!
I promise you Thag, it's "to the ballgame," not "at the ballgame"
I see you've finally made the club.
But Fred, getting around the bases is not about the big bat but through the courtesy of your two FEET.
I think you've got the wrong ball club.
OK - four strikes and you're out - if you say so.
No biting.
Ever clubbed a 99 mph fast ball before?
I played for the major club league before.
But i told you, you have to wear cleats!
Billy, TOMORROW is throwback uniform day.
It's past your pastime.
You must be the new guy from the BC league.
Ready to knock it out of Jurassic Park?
Is your farm system really a hunter gatherer system now?
You give our drugs a bad name, Zug. For heaven’s sake, get a haircut and buy a uniform.
At least we managed to teach him "Swing."
Honest, there's not smidgeon of pine tar on this bat.
Throwing it way back tonight, huh Terry?
Run softly. You're carrying a big stick.
Wrong GAME, dude.
Here's a little tip for you, rookie. You need to shorten up on your jawbone.
With that bat, I have to assume that you literally want to kill the ball
This 'Paleo Night' promotion is getting out of hand.
Steroid free but what about your DNA?
It looks out of date.
Everyone batter needs to wear a helmet, no exceptions!
I see you're the big bat in the lineup.
I think you've taken this superstition thing a bit too far.
The bat doesn’t have tar on it you stupid creature. That catastrophe hasn’t happened yet!
In this instance, "The Babe" is meant to be a compliment.
And it only took you 60,000 years to get your call-up.
Actually you were scheduled for the first pitch, but they couldn't find a regulation size rock.
Rules Matter! If you win you don't get to eat me.
Was it tough to be a power hitter in the stone ball era?
I’m Lief, the Relief.
What? I heard this was our greatest past time.
Real tigers don't have pinstripes.
Hold on, he's almost done warming up.
You must be the designated 'killer'.
You can expect a small boulder to be coming your way.
Listen, he doesn't mean "hit me". Strike one is a reference to a number based on the Hindu-Arabic numeric system developed in India around 700 AD.
When did the Mets get new uniforms?
Which way is home?
Are we here to play ball, or you gonna take a poo?!
Stand back. I’m the next Babeous Ruthus.
They call me B.C.
I already told you. Dr. Who's on first.
I think you guys are taking "Throwback Thursday" a bit too far.
Forget the fancy stuff, just swing at the ball. You don't have to invent the wheel.
And you must be the new guy from the Mets’ hunter/gatherer system, right?
Batter oop oop,oop, oop oop
Ump, stick with me, you could save 15% or more on your next ball to the head by switching to GEICO!
George, c’mon man...I can see the pine tar on your jersey.
Step aside buddy, no Trump supporters are allowed to bat here.
I know A-Rod, and you're no A-Rod
Weren't you in that Geico commercial?
You sure that uniform is regulation?
Looks like you found the clubhouse.
This is Bob's first game back after his suspension for domestic assault.
The Giants traded you to get the Panda?
No offense, but the guys and I found your hunting depictions in the dugout a bit derivative.
Yeah, I agree, the dugout probably did evolve from the cave.
That last curve froze you for 40,000 years
Looking good, Jason! I see that the paleo diet your manager has you on is working.
That bat doesn't look regulation.
And everyone thought it would be Ted Williams who would make the first icy slumber comeback.
The fans really love the throwback unis.
You realize that’s a dugout, not a cave...
You better hope I don't strike out.
We think you're gonna bunt.
I really hate these 'throwback jersey' promotions.
The next one won't be a rock.
So let me bring you up to speed.  First of all, WAR doesn't mean what you think it means...
Not only that. I refuse to wear necklaces.
Bro, seriously, I think going commando would be a really bad choice!
Nice oar. Also, this isn't Wack-a-Mole, gramps.
Think you can hit his knuckleball, you knucklescraper?
We didn't think you'd notice.
You! Put slider back on plate.
'No, I will hit YOU back to the stone age!'
I'm pinch-hitting for the rest of the team.
Cool. You're the first Pro-Magnon man.
Most of the guys in our league prefer aluminum bats.
Did you just eat the rosin bag?
No, your ERA is Paleozoic, his is 3.2.
Watch out for his knuckles on the ground ball -just a tip.
I got it in the clubhouse. Why do you ask?
Who say's it not a  league approved bat?
The Stone Age? Where's that, Bloomington?
Sure, I'm only a .220 hitter, but I have a .340 fantasy average in my man-cave.
I heard you came up from the bush league
Wow! Moving to DH really is the way to extend your career, isn't it?
Name’s Casey. I’m going to bring  joy to Mudville
Your wife? Last I saw her she was in the dugout.
Too Much?  - But it is Neanderthal Night
Shoeless Joe slugged from the other side
Take it easy on the backswing.
Yeah, they just brought me up.
That's one Mammoth bat you got there, buddy
Really? How long have you been in the minors?
The pitcher’s going to ‘fire’ the next one into your ‘wheel’house, if that’s any help.
Just try to hit it.  We can discuss the in-field fly rule later.
Is Barney on deck?
Aaron, go back and get your uniform.
Lemme guess. Another call-up from the originalists?
Scouting report say you have a killer batting average.
The mastodon bone is illegal  but your 
beard is cool, step in pal.
We're not going to be as easy to eliminate as the Mammoths.
You might keep an eye on my follow through.
'Let me guess...Moneyball?"
I think you're taking "clubhouse" too literally.
Me hunter, you gatherer.
I've never seen a more natural swing.
Can you hook me up with your steroid doctor?
Well, if it isn't the old bunter-gatherer.
Hey...move up in the batter's box
Try to get a hit. I hear they're thinking of trading you for a Millennial.
Remember now, the ball not the pitcher.
Somehow, 'The Cleveland Neanderthals' manages to be even more offensive.
I see the league is really embracing America's past time
I guess things have loosened up now that George is gone.
Can you pitch?
Did you see they traded LeBron?
Have you ever thought of trying an aluminum bat?
Your uniform is too retro.
Okay, Okay, you swing a big stick, but plenty of guys in baseball have a bigger beard these days!
Don't worry.  Even a caveman can get a hit with this guy on the mound.
Choke up and look for an inside slider.
Home is cave, not flat pentagon.
Now that you’re a free agent, Johnny, it looks like you want them to trade you back to Boston.
Can I interest you in some car insurance.
You think I'm a catcher, but I'm actually pooping.
Prehistoric Ballers
Be sure it's the ball you hit.
It's about time the National League agreed on the DH.
But it was a regulation bat 40,000 years ago!
Me Ugh. You Ump.
No, Jurassic Park is across town.
It really took ages for you to finally make it to the world series
Ya know, that beard is why the Yankees will never trade for you, even if your OBP is .419 during the last three seasons.
I just came from the club house.
Did you just come straight from the clubhouse?
Yup, baseball's going extinct.
Remember, this time swing at the ball and not at my head.
"I hope you're not planning to slide in that outfit."
Nice uniform ...
Up from the pleistocene league?
Are you the call up from the Paleolithic league?
I heard you've had a Mammoth hitting year
You know to try and hit the little white ball and not me, right?
I was traded years ago.
Gender neutral uniforms.  How cool.
Just so long as it isn't aluminum.
Heeeey batter batt...nevermind.
What? You thought only the fans are Neanderthals?
The pre-steroid era!!
Ok, one more time:  the strike zone is not my head...
The game's evolved a bit since your day, old timer.
Watch out for the Brush back pitch,
it's evolutionary
Whadda you starin' at?  We invented mom and apple pie too.
We don't hit and run, we continue to hit it until it is dead!
That's the slowest trip around the bases I've ever seen.
And here I thought the Dodgers were an old club.
Now THAT’S a “Throwback Jersey.”
You couldn't hit the broad side of a brontosaurus with that thing
Yes, we can watch Jurassic Park again after the game for the hundredth time.
Uh, Casey couldn't make it. I'm the pinch-hitter.
Seriously.  How did you pass your drug test?
I'm the pinch hitter for the Geicos
Yeah, I knew beards were in, but that's taking things too far.
If you want to bat clean-up, stop dragging Coach's wife by the hair.
Well, I've been a designated hitter for my clan for years.
Traditionally, you should at least be wearing socks.
Johnny Damon, coming out of retirement?
What was a good clubbing average in the big-inning?
When you live forever, your favorite bat lasts a long time.
I'd say he should try to walk you, but you've been doing that for a couple thousand years.
Let's see whatcha got, rookie.
I find your team’s uniform totally un-American.
This has been a really long inning.
No sliding-  this isn't an X-rated game.
Don't worry about the pine tar, it's fossilized.
Yes, and yes, I am on  the Paleo diet.
If its a close play, slide feet-first.  Baseball is a family game.
Let me guess. You're up from the bush leagues?
Just how long have you been on the Paleo diet?
Performance enhancing clubs are not allowed.
The oversized bat isn’t your only problem.
Who did you have for breakfast?
When they said they were sending me back to the minors, I didn't think it would be this far back.
I see they FINALLY brought you up from Triple A.
It’s take me out to the ball game. Not take me out at the ball game.
You're the designated hitter?
It's not your batting average that's got us worried.
Time flies
Watch out,this pitcher invented fire.
Crushing the ball" means hitting it out of the park, not "beating it into the ground.
Ha, a slugger from the pre-steroid era!
What!  He is going to try to throw the stone past me and not at me.
Three rocks and you’re out.
You might just need all that equipment if I strike out.
Jeez - just how long was that 7th inning stretch, anyway?
First hire an agent, then discover fire.
Don't take it amiss if I step bach a little.
How’s that whole  Paleo diet thing workin’ out for you, big guy?
I heard you guys haven’t made it to the World Series in over  4,000 years.
Between knees and letters -- what are they?
You can't hit.  You are out of uniform.
You must've been on the bench for a while.
"Dude, is that your Flintmobile in the no parking zone?"
My upcoming Hall of Fame baseball card is a cave painting.
Old timers day at the old ball park again
I don't think that mask is going to help you
I love that you have not let the modern game affect your approach
#3 on Grog’s bucket list - done!
Wait, you’re the guy with that long contract, right?
Nice dress... batter up.
Do you knowt the rues?
When the ball crosses the plate, you swing and hit it.
If the pitcher believes in Darwin, he'll probably walk you.
I gather your manager is strong on fundamentals.
So simple, even a caveman could do it.
Let's just hope they don't notice you're not using a regulation bat.
Sure you’re not supposed to be playing in the old timers game?
I didn’t know the Paleo diet came with a uniform.
Have you tried support hose?
Just got called up from the paleos?
I head they call you Babe Rock.
It’s 2-3 and you.
This ain't the Neanderthal League anymore.
Yeah, we're just gonna call that a home run.
Good thing they haven’t discovered asterisks yet
I'm telling you Bro... you'll get more traction and power if you wear cleats"
You know you're just supposed to hit the ball -- right?
'Cubs' not 'clubs'
the umpire checking the rule for tar on your bat.
I agree.  Throwback uniform night has gotten out of hand.
I hope you're wearing a cup.  He likes to pitch inside.
When you say you're up here to hit, you're talking about the ball, right.
I tried going paleo too but just couldn't give up dairy
Have you been talking the roids' or have I?
So. How is playing for Houston?
I'm the DH... Designated Hunter
You think season is over?
I got called up from the Neanderthal League.
I'm the inspiration for the movie,"The Natural."
Yeah, it was a long rain delay, but it wasn't that long.
Look, baseball may be timeless - but it's not retro.
That Paleo Diet is really working.
Your mom wears combat boots.
Where'd the umpire go? That bat doesn't look up to regulation.
So, you're an original slugger, huh?
Don't you think you went a little overboard with founders day?
Didn’t realize this is a club team.
no, it's Iowa...
You don't bring a club to a bat fight
Alright, alright. So you never used steroids, 
but you're over the top with the Flintstones Vitamins.
Now that's a tool of ignorance
Nice bat
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look?
I think you may have misunderstood the concept of sabermetrics.
Bob, I think you may be taking the Paleo thing a bit too far.
I've heard of "waiting on a fastball," but this is ridiculous."
As far as I know, you're the first from the Pleistocene Epoch.
Paleo Diet has a few side effects I see.
Has this game really been around, that long?
That's right, this sign means just stand there...
Is that pine tar?
You stink.
How long is Aaron Judge out?
Next inning I hunt and you gather.
We know you're the club's new Designated Hitter, but you can't use that  fungo bat!
Don’t overthink it.
You're hugging the plate, sir.
It's still 3 strikes, but you can pick your own walk-up music, and they have sushi at the concessions.
I'm not judging – if the Paleo Diet's working for you, great.
I got this.
You were delayed?
I'd go for the sacrifice bunt if I were you.
Tell the pitcher to let me get a hit or I hit you instead!
I used to play for the  Mets!
Dude, you're the team mascot of the Cavemen, not the designated hitter.
You can bat as long as you don't "take a knee."
Are you sure that's a regulation bat?
The wife says algae is the new paleo.
I can hit you right out of the park!
I'm a bearded woman. Yes, I'm wearing a dress, AND I carry a big stick. Any other questions ump?
Ok old-timer, let's see what you got!
No, no. Sabermetrics have nothing to do with a tiger.
The last player from the Steroid Age
Wow. Your team took it to far with the vintage uniforms.
Ump! That's a funny name
You don't know what a ball is?  You don't know what a strike is?  Just stand there like that and let him pitch to you three times.
Your team really ought to update your uniforms
Not a foul ball. Just foul.
When did they trade you from the Tigers to the Mammoths”
I’m transitioning.
Is baseball still boring?
I said:  “I’ve seen better bats in a cave, man.” There’s a comma... “Cave - comma - man.”
Party after the game at my man cave.
If only you’d work on your social media presence.
Wooden bat, I presume.
That was an inside stoneball
I just came from the clubhouse. What's the score?
Wow, you must've been in the minors forever!
well now i've seen EVERYTHING!
Just up from the minors?
One strike and you will be gone.
Yes, there were four balls Thal.  You can walk softly to first base.
You weren’t supposed to take ‘hit it back into the Stone Age’ literally
Easy out!
I warned you months ago to ease off the 'roids.  Now there's no turning back.
These "throwback uniforms" are getting out of hand.
This signal means four balls. That’s what they will pitch to you So you don’t need to swing
Finally, someone who looks like he bats cleanup.
Me tired of carrying whole baseball club on shoulder.
You gotta play by the rules!
I don't think that's a regulation bat.
He’s coming with the stone ball!
Yogi said ‘90% of baseball is half mental,’ so you’ve actually got an advantage on us.
No, you dumbbell, it wasn't the 'middle finger'!
After the game, do you want to go clubbing?
America it’s past time.
This and fire, baby!
No, I said, "You look like a pro minion."
I can see you were  in the  minor leagues for a while.
Remember: Krog no hit catcher - Krog hit ball.
So what, if a fan called you a Neanderthal
BYOB does not mean Bring Your Own Bat.
Look, if you can’t grasp the infield fly rule, you really shouldn’t be playing catcher. Only a neanderthal wouldn’t understand.
So here's de straight skinny, kid:  Three strikes an you go back to where you came from.  Understan?
Hey Grok, have you ever met Fred Flintstone?
I can tell you play the game the right way.
So, big deal, you survived the Ice Age. Now try to make it through the Baseball Glacial Period.
Fine, you've got me. I can't explain the semantic distinction between a bat and a club. But there's no way that thing's regulation.
Where’s your uniform
Grok don't miss ball, step away from the plate or be prepared to be hit!
Where have you been all these years?
You realize that a strike out is not a comment on you as a person, right?
According to the latest sabermetric data, my age demographic lines up with the fan base.
You guys carry this throw-back uniform thing pretty far.
I find Old-Timers' Games cheesy.
What’s with the beard?
You called for a batter?
Good, now the ball. It's the opposite of the umpire, so try to miss all three.
I'm giving the sign for a High Ball. It isn't a pitch. I need one every time you come to bat.
Wait till you see the Green Monster here in Jurassic Park."
You might want to step back a little.
Pangaea? I hardly knew 'er.
Remember you get 3 strikes at the ball, AT THE BALL.
I hear it's Bobblehead Day here at Jurassic Park.
They've gone too far with the throwback uniforms.
It was this or exhibit at the Museum of Natural History.
I wish they just stuck with the gecko.
This is the Field of Dreams. Don't question it.
Do you have my rock?
That throwback jersey is a keeper.
Just don't break the bat..
Just up from the Neanderthal League?
Take a swing.  Last at bat you caved.
Here comes one right in your wheelhouse. Oh, you don't know what that is yet do you?
Mike, you play for the Tigers...not the Saber-toothed Tigers.
Hard Ball deserves a HARD BAT!
So is it true you signed for a hundred shanks of water buffalo?
Og spend LOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG time in minors.
Nice dress Slugger!
Still proud of our original uniforms.
It was either this getup or taking a knee.
I hate the throw back uniforms.
I'm a pinch hunter
The idea is to hit the ball, not me!
No, you stand here and try to hit that little white thing.
Hey, Alley Oop, the rules say you gotta wear a helmet.
Is that a "Simian Slugger"?
Your first season up from the minors?
Regulation sportswear only, but I love the club!
You are taking this paleo diet too far.
Wow! You certainly give new meaning to the term "ball club."
Coach says "It's back to the basics" for us.
I   have  not  seen  a  club  like
that  in ages!
Hey man, this is totally in compliance with Rule 6.06(d).
Allow me to explain the intent behind Throwback Night.
Are you here for the game or just looking for a meal?
So that hitting guru really changed your style, huh?
You can be confident that the neanderthal on first won't tag you out, he extincts
I suppose if the bats are in the cave, the caveman can come to bat.
Hey Rookie - careful how you swing that club!
Calling balls and strikes: so easy a Supreme Court Justice could do it? You’ve got to be kidding.
Try not to slide...it's going to hurt.
Approaching the plate now is Cav Eman, a terrific slugger and great addition to the  Yankee Club House.
Now I see why they named the stadium "Pleistocene Park."
No helmet or cup?  What a Neanderthal.
You want caveman to hit ball? Back in my day your head was ball.
Been at Scranton long time pal?  Same game here in the big leagues, even a caveman can do it.
Really?  It’s Neanderthal League day?
There was a time when beards weren't allowed, you know.
...and by 'easy out,' I mean it from a skills perspective, not an historical one.
Keep growing that beard, we need to make it to the World Series.
You're out of your league.
He could not adapt to the modern strike zone
Aren't you guys taking the team's new Geico sponsorship a little too far?
This throwback uniform craze has got to stop.
I didn’t know we were playing Carlsbad
That's why the walk-up music was 'Alley-Oop?'
He may only have a a .237 batting average, but you should see how he uses that thing on a mammoth.
Looks like that paleo diet is really working for you!
Old timers' day, Flintsone smashes a cave ball to right.
You call curve ball, Me break head.
No, I swear, two fingers is a fast ball.
How'd you beat the tests?
No batter no batter no batter, Caveman!
Designated hitter?
I have a tight swing.
That's bogus.  I ain't wearin' those polyester uniforms.
Three strikes and I'm out--cold.
Boy, talk about a curveball.
Yes, you've got quite a Ball Club!
No, my whisk broom isn't edible.
Your bat's not regulation size...but neither is your dress
Is this where I strike?
Call-up from the Paleolithic?
I like your dress.
Ya I was a late-bloomer too.
Me. I’m on first.
Ya Muthas a Tyrannosaurus
Now batting, the 2018 Comeback Player of the Year.
So they finally found someone PEDs negative.”
Made your own bat?
Me Pro-Ball-Player-Magnon.
No, you want the hockey rink. H-O-C-K-E-Y.
Just keep pitching around him--it's going to be years before he learns the strike zone!
It’s none of my business but you might want to back off the PEDs.
No curve balls—understand?
Kneeling, eh?
You have no idea....
I'm showing you the signs because you can't read them, anyway.
Of course my bat's bigger than yours they call this the Big Leagues for a reason!
Fans prefer me to dress like them.
Batta! Batta! Can't hit the curve. Batta! Batta! Can't hit the curve.
You've been benched for a while, huh?
League crack down on steroids, so coach make whole team go paleo.
The Yankees chose not to participate in retro jersey night.
No women - just a ball.
If you strike out, they will send you back to the Paleolithic League.
It's a new concept called sports.
I don't care if you invented the game. Your uniform is not acceptable.
I heard you’ve been carrying the club this month!
So what if you hit it out of Jurassic Park.
During your last at bat, when I said your mom sucks pterodactyl dicks, that wasn't cool. I'm sorry, man. I know the dinosaurs had been extinct for millions of years by the time your mom was here on earth, blowing every wooly mammoth she could find.
Me hit big things to eat, not little white ball.
I guess we're still in the early innings.
I just got called up. In "D" ball we have to make our own bats and uniforms.
I'll be honest. I am a one-tool player.
Kudos to you for havin' the guts to wear a dress out here. A lot of us have been wantin' to do it for years.
I'll take it from here.
I'm on the paleo diet. You?
Dry cleaners lose the uniforms again?
Just up from the Cave  League ?
You're only supposed to hit the ball.
Yhea, I recommend the stadium Dino-dog with hot mustard.
Sorry, the rules say you can't substitute a club for a bat.
Oh, Hey Corg - try not to swing so low this time"
No, you're looking for the Paleolithic Era.  We're still in the free agency/arbitration era.
Just don't talk_Just don't think_Just hit the ball.
Fastball, curve, fastball. Just don't hurt me.
Nice throwback: uniform, steroids, and corked bat.
He's throwing Clovis points.
I hear your mama’s a vegan.
Homo erectus up!  Get it?
Any chance I can get that bat for my man cave?
They told me today was Retro Day.
So easy to hit, a caveman could do it !
Me Catcher, you Batter.
It’s called “throwback millennia.”
So, I hit the round thing, I run, I slide, and after that I get the steak?
Whassa matta, Chunky? No major league uniforms in your size?
Was the “Pine Tar Incident”
before your time?
No, im a cave man, not a bat boy.
Now remember, you’re supposed to go for the ball, not my head.
Me think squatting zebra look funny.  Me take him home for dinner.
Yeah, yesh, rock on.
Whatever.
I don't think you're taking those human growth hormones correctly!
Im sorry. The designated hitter is only allowed in the American League.
Hmm, I think I' better back up a couple of feet
I best at hit ball. Everyone know it," Donald Thump announced to the catcher
No doubt, folks..the D.H. has extended Kroc's career..
Welcome to the show kid, you finally made it
Coming up to bat now is Unga, known for his mammoth home runs.
You'll never hit his knuckle-dragger ball.
They just brought me up.
Like I always  say ump, there' s  no place like home''
I understand there is talk of a 20 second pitch clock.
Weren't you on the last Red's team to make it to the series?
You've got me rethinking this whole 'hey batta batta swing' concept
I'm definitely asking the ump to check that thing for pine tar.
No, I'm not your din din.
Are you gonna  bunt ?
They told me to put some good wood on it
I don’t remember you at spring training
Did they at least give you a cup to wear under that?
You are not really in this for the sport are you?
Global Warming has a lot to answer for.
So the guy over there is gonna throw a ball and you use that bat to... ahh never mind.
My ancestors could have used that uniform.
Before the Golden Age of Baseball, there was...
What cave did you play for?
Sir, I'm not sure that qualifies as a bat...
Where do I get gum?
My records always have an asterisk...
I'm thinking about giving up clubbing. You?
I didn’t know the Mets were this desperate for hitters.
Show me where it says that in the rule books.
Finally brought you up from the less then minimum pay miners leagues.
It's not regulation, but it's all I know.
It's the 9th inning, and I finally get up to bat!
After you sing the Anthem, we need you to leave the field, dude.
Honest, I’m just the catcher.
Ork, long time no see.
This is my home uniform
Is this  what you call home plate?  Where's the food
Did you come up through the drift?
Hey, Club rules rule clubs out.
Big stick!
Happy Halloween,Jayson.
Beware : one strike , no balls .
Is that pine tar on your club?
Overcompensating much?
So, I gotta ask ya:  Was Fred Flintstone any good at second?
Great! Another illegal immigrant who's a member of the MLB-13.
What’s your batting average?”
“500...400 tigers, 200 wooly mamoths.
Speak up, Fungo.  I didn't catch that.
Just play along, dude. The fans love Old Timers Day.
You wouldn’t still be playing if this were the National League.
Nice Wheels.
Let me try. This seems easier than hunting ptelodactyls.
George Brett told me this bat is legal
Go ahead, see what happens if you signal for another curve ball.
Actually, in college ball, we use aluminum.
Sorry, only a bat from a cave.
Your mother was a neanderthal.
He's been throwing Clovis points all night.
Regulation uniforms only in this league...I’m gonna have to 
report you to PETA
Am I walking softly enough for you?
Okay, maybe I'm going over the paleolithic diet. I admit it, but I'm sure I hit better than a vegan.
Well, the coach said I really needed to learn to use my primal instincts...
Did you say DH,or was that Duh?
"Whoa. How long you been juicin', bro?
Is that pine tar from La Brae?
Hey, did you know that the new rule bans the use of a corked club this era?
So, you're the new designated hitter.
You're either in the wrong ball park or in the wrong era.
What do you mean slugging percentage is over-rated?
You know what, let's make it 4.
Despite the scouting reports you should know I fashion myself after "Boog" Powell.
You can't stand there.  You're required to have both feet completely in the batter's box.
Maybe you guys are taking this retro uniform thing a bit far.
They tell me you're with the Tigers.
You must be the new guy!
I expect a mammoth at bat.
What, are you some kind of fashionista?
What's it like being called up from retirement after so many years?
If you strike out, you'll die out.
It's the throwback uniform.
Coach thought it would be funny...
I thought you old-timers didn't believe in the designated hitter."

Michael G. Murphy
Seattle, W
It's the clubhouse,not the club house.
Where's the meat of the plate?
Your club and mine are very different.
Attitude is not always everything.
Watch out when he runs, this guys just discovered his wheels!
As a matter of fact, Bubba, I do have a bone to pick with you!
Our throwback uniforms are from the Steroid Era. What era are yours from?
Sorry, we don't have club sports any more.
I really hate Throwback Thursday night.
We play "on" ball clubs  We don't play "with" ball clubs.
What are you, Bush League?
Look, the game has changed a lot!!
Hit what ball? Grob here to hunt cubs and tigers!
And you thought walking was hard."
Is it true you used to play back in the day?
I can't explain it! You just have to run to first base first.
You're out of uniform.
Your bat doesn't conform to "homo Sapiens" standards
Don't make the Cubs wait another 100 years
Good to see you again, Mr. Werth.
Old school, huh?
Watch out. This next guy’s a real Neanderthal.
There's no dying in baseball.
These throwback uniform promo nights are getting out of control.
How many Old-Timers' Day games is this for you
They weren't kidding when they said that your manager was 'old-school'.
I may be an old timer, but I can still hit the hide off of anything that moves.
If you plan on sliding into home, you're going to need to wear something under that.
What's a ball?
How many of those bats did you have made?
Buddy you don't stand a chance, our pitcher is a total Cro-Magnon.
You’re experiencing what is known as déjà vu.
Y'know, that's not what they mean by "ball club."
. . . and you think you're America's pastime.
Didn't think he would take the paleo diet so seriously
Ah, so you're the opposing team's pinch clubber!
Slow game.  So, you were a starter?
I like to hit, but when do I get to pinch?
Brain? No need protection!
We just need for you to hit the ball. Don't club it to death.
Some of us come took longer than others to come up from the minors, I signed from the Neanderthal  Prehistorics and you?
Uh...The Natural History Museum is two blocks down. Right?  Two down!
You too close to plate.
He has a mean knuckle-dragger ball.
You made the big club now, huh?
You wave hands, say slow throw.  Me hit ball or hit you.
It's not just your swing - you need swagger.
I'm making America's pastime great again.
Let me guess. They told you it was throwback uniform day.
Your batting stance has really evolved.
Speak softly and carry a big stick.
Meathead means something different in our time
What do you think of the new Nationals uniform?
It’s ok, this isn’t a catchers’ mitt, either.
It doesn't look regulation.
What took you so long?
I knew the Yankees were old, but I didn't expect this
This guy looks like a real swing and a miss type operator... but he could get nasty after the third strike!
I was told  I would be fighting against tigers sent in from Detroit.
You'll get the next one. His knuckleball is pretty primitive.
Break a leg!
Clubber up!
They told me it was just a matter of hanging around the dugout for long enough to get my shot.
'Damn basketball players get the shoe contracts.'
Hey pal, do me a favor.  Don’t swing at any low pitches.
Welcome to The Show, pal. Long time in the minors eh?
Yeah, a bunt would sure confuse everyone"
You aren't going to go all Caveman on me, are you?
So what's the strategy here, Dave?"
"Well, with two outs and a base open, I think you take the club out of his hand and take your chances with Oof Boof.
They sure are taking the retro look back a few years.
Heard you got a raw deal on your signing bonus too. 
I got 1/2 a buffalo and a pelt,
How 'bout you?
Throwback Uniform Night is one of our most popular promotions.
You can take the mask off now. I know its you Yogi. The pinstripes gave you away.
Do you know the signs?
Rod Serling says, "Hello."
So you're the pinch hitter who's been chilling in the clubhouse.
Is that one of those new Louisville sluggers ?
Your at bat is one for the ages.
You'll be fine, the pitcher's a headhunter.
I can see you’re a big hit.
This game really rocks.
didn't I tell you it was better than the wheel and fire.
Wanna see a real man cave?
My ball club? Rex Sox.
Not all talk, huh?
You club ball for ball club?
Don't swing, and I'll tell you where the mammoths are.
Wow, how long were you down in AAA?
you know those beards are really in these days
It's sort of like gathering, I suppose. But I only do it in the top half of the inning.
Tell me again.   Whom do I knock out  first?
The idea is not to club the ball and then eat it.
Guess you think you are going to club one outta here?
Ever read J. D. Salinger?
The cricket field is next door.
I need bigger balls!
Are you sure you're playing with the right club?
I loved you in Moneyball.
My wife's also doing the Paleo diet.
Don't swing.  He'll walk you.
After you hit don't throw the bat. Just drop it and run.
Now batting... all the way from the Paleolithic....
Wait till you see whose on deck
They're called "the tools of ignorance."
Really? Does it look like I’m going to need a catcher?
Bush Leaguer,huh?
This brings the designated hitter position to a whole new level.
Isn't it enough that I invented fire? I have to show you how to play baseball too.
Are you wearing a cup?
Hey batter, you're gonna cave, man
So that is the prehistoric model?  I didn't think they sold those anymore.
I heard you were a throwback kind of player.
Nice club. Sorry, I'm already seeing someone.
Well, baseball is the game of America's past time.
Good point. Though controversial in baseball, tar never claimed my entire family.
Not good. Either I hit or I'm going down to the Devonian Period.
I’m guessing you’re more a power than contact hitter.
Cleveland Indians was simply unacceptable.
How long have you been the designated clubber for the New York Neanderthals ?
Yeah, I love these old-timers' games too.
I love your throwback jersey.
For the last time Fred, a strike is not a good thing in baseball!
These throwback uniforms are getting old.
I think your owner took "Throwback Uniforms" day a bit too far Johnny.
Cool throwback uniform!
If I don't hit ball I hit you.
Let Nate Silver factor in club size.
I don't think it's your time to bat quite yet
So, Pro-Magnon now?
I prefer wooden bats.
This game is so slow it feels like we're going backwards
What club are you with?
Steroids,  Ugugu?
I'm not the next batter. I'm the new catching coach.
Does this guy ever throw wild pitches?
Sorry, dude, that's not a regulation bat.
Carl, I know I texted "past time" instead of "pastime" but could we just play?
God damn hipsters...
Maybe I'm not the best hitter, but I have had starring roles in all the Jurassic Park/World movies.
Don't you think it's time to retire?
bunt,man,bunt
How's that paleo diet working out for you?
Rumor in the clubhouse is, Johnson bulked up in the off-season by adhering to the Paleolithic diet."
So you are a Yankee....yabba dabba doo for you
Cool uniform but where is your number?
Er Ump? Ump?
I think your bat is a tad over 2.61 inches in diameter and 42 inches in length.
Just pretend the ball is a saber-toothed tiger.
I guess this is America's favorite past time.
Did anyone ever tell you you look like Carl Yastrezemski?
I'm all for throwback uniforms, but seriously?
Stop overthinking it.
Yes, I understand, but normally we use the ball more than once.
Robert Redford was more convincing
Only Sapiens are allowed to use loaded bats in the Homo erectus league.
That paleo diet is really working for you!
This isn’t car insurance, Gary. You don’t get to be better than me at everything.
At least your bat got bigger after you switched to paleo.
It's so easy even you could do it.
Wrong place buddy. This is the minors. You're definitely mesolithic league material.
Batting helmets are now required?  Boy, the game as evolved.
I think you're taking paleo a bit too far.
Grog say, him hit me with ball, I hit you!
If i miss, the stone will kill you.
Now that's a retro uniform!
Strike the ball, not me.
Is that bat even legal?
Did you play with Shoeless Joe, ol’ timer?
No balls, strikes, plates?  Just want heads.
We know you Judge,even outta uniform
That's ball "many." Take your base.
He's a real old timer
Hey, Slugger, you forgot your batting helmet.
No, I wasn't signaling that I need to take a dump.
I guess guess there’s no hiding my steroid use now.
Your bat is leaking pine tar all over my plate
Yeah, I did say “Yabba, dabba, do!”
The club is a team.  You hit with a bat.
Just screwballs for you.
You must be the hot new prospect...
And I'M saying the designated hitter rule makes for more exciting play!
Sign your new contract yet?
Are you the forgotten “Bash Brother”?
The designated batter finally comes to the senior league.
"Hey batta, batta. You couldn't hit a mastodon if it was sound asleep.
We had to dig deep for our throwback uniforms.
How's the new paleo diet goin'?
Where’d you get that Israeli bat?
It'll be a slider, low and outside. Just remember, you have to take my turn at saber-tooth watch tonight.
You were the first to domesticate the Cubs.
I see you don't wear batting gloves.
Sorry. That's a Red Sox bat. You can't use that!
Man, I thought they kept me down in the minors way too long.
I don't care if it has been in your family for generations.
Say it ain't so, Zog.
Swing for the Mesozoic.
More like Shoeless Joe Jagoff lol. You suck.
Nice bat, man.
When someone asks if baseball and softball are the same thing
What no batting gloves??
I hear you speak softly!
Cleveland rebranding?
Right. If you miss the rock 3 times you go back to the dugout-uh, I mean cave.
Plan on knocking it out of the park again?
Sorry, this is the thinking man's game.
Babe's Roots???
If you get another hit don't club the 1st baseman again.
The Home Run Derby was last week.
Aren't you taking Paleo a bit too far?
Batter's up.   Finally.   I've been waiting for ages.
I always wondered why the call it the dugout
Your team could use a cleanup.
You've got tobacco spit on your tunic.
I say the retro look has gone to far back but it is comfortable.
The guys in the man cave sent me out...they're busy discussing a round thing they call a baseball.
fast ball down the middle...I promise.
Just up from Triple A, right?
Self-serving or not . . . BUNT!
Wow! They finally sent you up from the sub-minors.
A curveball? Haven't you heard those went the way of the dinosaur? It's all velocity now.
Beards are out this season.
Don't tell anyone I said so, but I really like the throwback uniforms.
I'm guessin' you're the rookie they called up from the Pro-Magnon League, huh?"
You might reconsider calling for the high inside fastball
If he doesn't throw me some strikes, I'm going to beat the crap out of him.
For the last time: What did you just signal the pitcher he should do?
I'll tell you what I'm staring at....your'e not wearing a helmet
To Hell with your diamond, where I come from, clubs are trumps
Don't get mad at me if his first pitch is a close shave."
When I said 'go back to the way it was' I meant get rid of Replay Review
Yes...I am on the PALEO diet
Before PEDS, it was known as 'wheezing the juice'...bud-dy
You gonna hit the ball or kill it?
Haven't seen you in a while.
I hear you're the old man on the team.
Hey, what's up Dustin, things not going well on the PGA Tour?
So, how's the wife and dinosaurs?
Get used to it, chief--you're not in the bush leagues anymore.
all balls  no strikes
Wait 'til you see the size of the ball.
You have worthwhile opportunity to defy baseball analytics.
... You're a mascot, you can hit, and you're marginally less offensive than your predecessor.
Hey, welcome back.  I thought you retired about 40,000 years ago.
This kid on the mound's a real flame-thrower, know what I'm sayin'?
I know paleo is a lifestyle, but I think you've gone too far.
Yes, people call them the ‘Tools of Ignorance.’ And, yes, I’m sure you DID use it first.
Who the hell autographed that bat?
That’s a club. Try golf.
Coach said it was "throw back" night.
That may be a regulation bat but your uniform gives me pause.
That's a really dumb thing to say with you "squatting" there!
We've got your number, dude. Our pitcher's best pitch is a cave ball.
Now that’s what I call
a throwback jersey!
You're kidding.  You're batting cleanup?
Uh, yeah.  Brute force will work.
I’m guessing you got here without going through the farm system.
We'd like to welcome fans to
Rip-in-the-Time-Space-Continuum Night 
here at Yankee Stadium. 
Remember, don't feed the raptors!"
What he mean I have two balls?
What was the game like before the unwritten rules of baseball?
I think it was a Ball ... don’t you?
Bringing back the dead-ball era?
Go get 'em Slugger!
It really was a strike, please don't kill the messenger.
C'mon.....This is so easy......
You know, it's a damn shame what metrics have done to this game.
It works like this: one, two, many strikes - and you're out.
The guys throwing a baseball fella, not a boulder.
I know you hate being a DH but the game evolves.
Let's see if it's so easy......
Steroids?
My manager is truly old-school.
Yea- I've spent a lot of time in the minors waiting for this call-up
No worries! It’s so easy even a caveman can do it!
I beg your pardon. But I was told that this was going to be a manly game of cricket-whack-em.
Quit grunting, and get in the batter's box.
I'm a career .450 hitter vs. saber-toothed lions, so this Severino guy doesn't scare me a bit.
Remember, a walk is as good as a hit!
This takes the concept of "Throwback Thursday" to a whole new level.
So how long did they keep you waiting in the bull pen?
I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about these throwback uniforms.
Actually, they're referred to as the tools of ingorance.  What cave did you crawl out of?
At least you're not from the steroid era.
You must be the league’s first DH.
When they said you were up against the Tigers, that was Detroit, not Bengal.
I think you're looking for the Oldtimers game.
Been in the minors long...?
Yeah, but what's your strikeout to walk ratio?
You guys sure take Old -Timers' Day seriously.
You're only allowed to bat because stone throwers aren't classified as pitchers in the American League
Trust me. It's more popular than 'fire'.
I guess baseball IS a sports club!
One strike, and I will be out!
So I was thinking, why not go complete paleo?
One small step for integration.  One giant step for baseball.
I really hate the retro uniform nights.
What? It's Old Timers Day.
You sure waited a long time to be called up.
You're still younger than the average baseball fan!
I'm a catcher, not a throwback... which is more than I can say for you.”
I think you're taking "club league" too literally.
I hear you have one hell of a man cave.
You'll wanna strike before the Iron Age gets hot
Next up, pinch-hitting for Fred Flintstone, is Babe Rock.
The bat's fine, fella, but that uniform'll be a big problem when you slide.
Bludgeonder Up!
I don't think this guy can hit a curveball.
I hear you're getting traded to the Red Socks. You know what that means don't you... I mean the socks?!
That bat isn’t regulation, you Neanderthal!
This facial hair thing is really getting out of control.
You forgot your batting helmet.
Hit he ball and not me."
Bill Veeck is at it again.
Turn back the clock night is getting a little out of hand - no?
Watch your brow ridge.
So, you break the ball, you got a home run; you break my knee, you're out for the season—got that?
You guys are 400,000 games back at the end of July, why don't you pack it in already?
You just up from triple A?
They can make us skip wearing cleats and arm sleeves, but deodorant is mandatory, buddy.
What the hell clubhouse are you from?
During regular season I follow the Paleo diet.
I see you brought your ball club with you.
I can’t read. Which sign do I need to hit to win a suit?
I'm the cleanup hitter.
Now, this is what I call an 'Old Timers Game'
You heard me fella, this ain't no bush league!"
Doug, GEICO stadium ok, but even if you are making $50 mil a year, I play for the YANKEES and I'M embarresed!!!
Thanks for wearing the strike zone.
Steroids. Why?
If you're that old, maybe you should retire.
Wow! You guys must have a really deep dugout.
No, it's the ball you are trying to hit.  And no,
if you miss, you can't hit something else.
I am really getting tired of this unkempt beard look.
Except for the beard, you look a heckuva lot like Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Wow, the new salary cap is leading to some interesting roster decisions.
Dude! We won! You can shave the beard now.
Not in the face.
So you are going old school, eh?
You might want to choke up a bit.
I think you'll find there are rules about the use of pine trees as well as pine tar.
It's not rocket science.
Does this new uniform make me look fat?
Hope your R.B.I. is higher than your E.R.A.
You think I’M the monkey?
It's about time they called you up to the bigs.
I love how you bagged that T-Rex in the on deck circle.
hipsters...
Where's the "bull pen"?
You've taken throw-back uniforms to a new level.
It’s Family Night. I brought the hole clan!
I improved my launch angle but at the expense of the exit velocity.
Grunt at me like that again, and I'll signal for a pitch very high and very inside.
You must be the clean-up hitter.
First you hit and run, then you get uniform.
Look, I got no quarrel with the Neanderthals. Winner take all was your idea.
It's called "the dugout" - not "your cave."
Just hit the ball!
Sorry, the association really tightened bat regulations at the turn of the Bronze Age
No you DON'T get to eat what you hit
Bats in the cave. Here to clobber.
I know it's not regulation, but my pinstripe bearskins are in the wash.
I like the loose fitting uniform! Is that breathable fabric?
Slam that ball back to the Stone Age1
OK- No excitement now . . .
We both embrace the glacial tempo of the Game, right?
What they pulled you up from the Jurrasic Park league?
I heard it takes 4 million years to get to first base.
Yes, I’ve been in all the games.
We,ve heard you're a five tool guy
So you're the new heavy hitter they needed for the post-season...
Congrats to your agent. The press is going nuts.
Who designated you?
You're sure giving new meaning to 'ball club'
Why do you even bother trying to read the signs?
I've played in many modern eras.
Word has it you’re looking for another long-term deal.
I lived in a curvy cave for a year; I look forward to hitting Corey Kluber.
Stengel? He's been dead for years.
Even for someone called up from the paleolithic, I can't believe they let you out of the clubhouse without cleats.
Hobbs, you’re a little old for a rookie.
They wanted an exceptional E.R.A., not era.
Yes, the game has evolved quite a lot since you last played.
Word to the wise:  If you argue his calls, you best speak softly.
Nothing personal but I think this throwback uniform thing has gone too far
'Batter' means batter the ball. Don't forget that.
I'm guessing you've never seen the forkball.
You look like a natural to me.
Hunh. Urg remember you. NL Allstars. Squeeze play.
My genetic testing revealed that I’m part Neanderthal.
Gort run home.
You don’t look like you’ve been to the gym recently.
You're not supposed to tell me that you're going to bunt, I'm on the other team!
You must have taken the wrong steroids.
It's small and round, kinda like a wheel.
The way this guy is today you better wear a helmet.
We will walk you if you promise not to hit me.
You'll never get around on his fastball with that bat.
Wrong ball club.
The Red Sox AND The Cubs?
What I wouldn't give for your pension.
Dude, where's your helmet?
Since when are you on the Paleo diet?
The game's changed a bit since your syndication days, Bam.
Y'know I'm seeing a real lack of respect for the game from you Hipsters.
After the velociraptors, Chapman just can't intimidate me.
Do you think you’re the missing link to end the losing streak?
Home plate tectonics has really changed the feel of the game.
Congratulations on your GEICO sponsorship!
I don't care where you came from, the umpire won't let you bat unless you're properly dressed and are carrying a Louisville Slugger.
You were way more attractive on your tinder bio.
Hey buddy, you need to go put on a batting helmet !
Now up...Pinch, the Jurassic franchise’s top club hitter...looking toward the centerfield bleachers...
I'm going to need a bigger mask
How can you steal my signs when you can't read yet?
At least you get a cup
Don't cave, man ... This club's been yours for a long time.
Tell your wife you were out hunting
Remember, it's the BALL you're supposed to clobber.
I agree,the throw back uniform thing has gotten out of hand. But at least  the beard craze works with this one..
That ball's a lot harder to hit than a wooly mammoth, slugger.
I love these no-cut contracts."
Yes, you're right...there really is no purpose.
Yeah, I hate Throwback Uniform Day too.
The crowd roars as “Cave Ruth”, steps up to bat.
I'LL HAVE THE BBQ WINGS WITH A SIDE OF MASHED POTATOES.
No Gronk, just because their team name is the Wooly Mammoths doesn't mean you get to club and eat them
No throwing the club, okay?
No, it's not the batterer's box.
Aim for his head Larry, this guy used to play for the mammoths.
No offense, but this is a pea-brain marketing scheme.
The money must be good to bring you out of retirement.
This sign means, "Hit him with the first pitch."
That's the dumbest All-Star Game outfit ever!!
Oh ya, the place has Brontosaurus ribs that are to die for! It’s on 7th and Main.
Throw one more fastball at my head - go on - try me... I'll have eight balls - two of his - two of yours - two of your father's - and two of your manager's just for fun.
Catcher your friend—signal only hanging curveballs.
He trow ball at me, he dead!
It’s a fake pitcher.   You can just steal the base.
You haven't evolved past this.
Yes. You're the big slugger.
Sorry, did we wake you?
Yeah, I got it at the clubhouse. Very funny.
Stone clubs are not regulation
Ok. So baseball is a game from an earlier era.
I've waited EONS to be intentionally walked with just a nod.
Yeah ...the signs haven't evolved much.
Hey, didn't a meteorite take your team out a while back?
Okay, Fred Flintstone, I'm betting you yabba-dabba-don't.
That dugout might be a little too deep.
I'll tell you one last time, you hit the BALL not ME.
Yeah, I left that one behind: got my very own bat right here.
Do you know there are bat weight restrictions?
I'm afraid your bat isn't the official standard, sir"!
"Where I come from, there are no officials left."
Three
If you don't swat the little round object, it will attack you.
I guess you Mets will try anything at this point, huh?
I'm on a winning streak.  I suggest you be careful.
President Trump would like you to stand for the National Anthem. Are we going to have a problem?"
Who's your Doc? I'd like some of  that, too.
It's called a signal Mr. Trump, it's something we do in sports."
Psssst. Bunt.
No, no - I'm not gonna catch it so you can kill it.
Everybody's gotta have a gimmick.
Name's Alou.
I see you're up with the Big Club.
Did they bring you up from the minors or just thaw you out?
They said "Batter up", not "Beat her up!"
You may want to talk to the union about your throwback uniform.
I guess you’ve been in the minors for a long time
So you were with the Chauvet club before you got traded to Lascaux?
Yes, that was a third strike.
See, there are these things called "glasses," and umpires always need them but never have them.
So you're the new slugger I've heard about?
Don't take this personally, but I think it's time we repealed the designated-hitter rule.
not my call.....it is still strike three....
This team is seriouly wanting a win , hiring a sure hitter.
I have no idea where your wife is, but that is not a legal bat.
Let's see if I've got it. I club the ball to death, you dress it, and then serve it on the plate.
Tell me again; why can't we use aluminum bats in the majors.
They just brought me up from single N.
I bat clean up for The Hunters and Gatherers.
No aluminum bats in the majors.
I don't care if you're a pinch hitter. Ump says you still need to use a regulation bat.
I feel like anyone can grow a playoff beard, you know?”
OK, I guess it did work for Johnny Damon and Jayson Werth
Don't look at me like that. My home run took 200,000 years to extinguish.
You must be that guy brought up from the Pro-Magnon league.
Just hit the ball instead of hunting, and I promise you'll eat better than a brontosaurus burger.
The hot dog isn't really an animal, per se.
yabadaba-don't
Take off the pine tar.
No, you can't hit the cover off the ball and use it as a hat.
So, tell me about this sandwich you came up with...
As catcher, I WILL continue "taking a knee", 45!!!!!!
Wow, these throwback uni's are getting out of  hand.
It's a fastball, please don't hurt me.
Yankees under new management, bro?
Oh please, I invented foul balls.
They just called him up from the stone age league.
You know you can't use that if it has been corked.
"This is taking "Turn Back the Clock" a bit too far.
Throwback uniform day is getting out of hand......
Intentional Walk
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable playing football?
And you speak softly.
I wish these games evolved at a faster pace.
Too many bad calls!  The umpire is a real Neanderthal.
An ash club works better for me than maple."
No way you can hit a curve with that.
See this club?  If you kneel you'll feel it on your gimpy legs.
Brushback pitch?  Did you say brushback pitch?
Hey kid - this is the Show. We wear unis up here.
OK, now the ball. It's the opposite of the umpire, so try to miss three times.
So you’re the 3,000 year old rookie.
I'm just here for my rehab assignment.
What rule carving have you been reading?
After this series, we play the Tigers.
You're no Babe Ruth.
Take me to your club leader
I see you're playing it Old School.
Why Can't You Wear Pinstripes Like Everyone Else?
Remember, just hit the ball, not the pitcher.
How on earth can you catch her in that get-up?
Bunt, hunt - either way, it's batter up!
Don't give me 'ugga ugga'. You understand strike zones
Sir, we need you to leave the field and return to the designated Club Seating.
I’ve been in the Minor Leagues forever !
I see the beard, but that bat ain't regulation.
It's about time they brought you up to the Big League.
These "theme days" at the park have really gotten out of hand...
The umpire has already checked for Pine Tar.
I think that fastball did something funky to the space-time continuum.
When coach said we were going hack to the basics I didn't know he meant literally!
Zork want soft down middle - capisce?
It’s a sign of the times.
I’m the one dressed correctly for the game.
Exactly how big do you think the ball is??
When they said to wear our throwbacks tonight, they didn't mean that far back.
Ugh! means strike. Gah! means ball.
Leading off for the Stonehenge Giants is shortstop Billy "Big Stick" Burns.
Let’s paleo ball
Welcome to Jurassic ball park!
Ok, ready — let’s play stone
Sorry, how far back did you say you could hit it?
Did you play for The Cavemen in the minors?
You might want to choke up; he's throwing pretty hard today.
Hey Oldtimer Wrigley Field's had lights since 1988.
Look, agreed - the game is Neanderthal, but come on, man...
It's not you, I just never liked the designated hitter rule.
Yes, this is Fenway but YOU are so not Mookie Betts !
I'll think you'll find that mammoth meat is a banned substance.
Are you aware of the batter's interference rule, or just looking for the clubhouse?
Please, no more called third strikes!
This club is hardly a performance enhancing instrument.
Grog contemplated how the future ain't what it used to be.
Yea! Just got called up from the Neanderball League"
Back off on the steroids, Bam-Bam.
We'll pitch you low and away until your stance evolves
Here’s a clue:  we are never safe.
Okay, big fella.  Let's see if the cave man diet works.
The idiot told me to bunt.
I was in the minors FOREVER! I finally got the call to report to Jurassic Park.
Hey buddy, You aren't in uniform!
Hey rookie-just up from the bush league?
Don't you hate Throwback Night?
the  Denigrated hitter
Why can't you just paint caves like the others?
This isn't shirts versus skins.
Do you know of any good vegan restaurants?
We already have a bat boy.
Hope the caveman diet pays off.
Haven't you heard? It's a whole new ball game.
I'd suggest a bunt.
Just call every pitch a ball and you'll be safe.
Club the ball and then run like your life depends on it.
Did coach just discover you in the dugout?
I heard our society was devolving, but this is ridiculous
No, I don't know Fred Flintstone.
Sorry, pal. Old Timer's Day for your league was 20,000 years ago.
So this is what they meant by “back to basics”
First the batter, now me?
Are you the designated or the pinch?
Just a beard is so mainstream.
I’ll watch the strikes.
You watch the balls!
You know, this may appear as collusion.
Get that left shoulder under your chin big man.
If you don’t get some shoes, you’re about to experience the agony of defeat
Forget the diet and get back on steroids, man!
These "Turn Back the Clock" days are getting a bit ridiculous
How many extra innings is this?
No stealing our petroglyphs, Buster.
The original playoff beard.
Welcome to the Majors.  It is a step up from that Stone Age league you came from.
Stonewalling the catcher.
Geez, I can’t tell whether DH has evolved or devolved!
I only know how to make tools. Do you know here I can get a batting helmet?
If you don't swing I will show you how to make fire.
"That's funny-you don't look like Teddy Roosevelt."



'"
OK, Neandrathal...Lets see what you can do in the big league.
Good luck with the Mets.
Tonight's game: Digital Trolls vs. Social Media "Giants." Up to bat is I<3Privacy and crouching behind homeplate is Zuckerberg, trying to recover from the Sinker thrown by FakeBot69.
Don't you think you guys are going to far with your throw-back uniforms.
'
Next up, The Great Bam-Bam-bino!”
You look like a sitting duck to me"
Yeah, I tried the Paleo diet, but it just didn't work that well for me.
No mammoths here.
Our GM is still using “Barterball” to put together the roster.
Don't swing at me, OK?  Get mad at that other guy and swing at whatever he throws in your general direction.
You must be a power hitter.
You wearing a jock strap under that?
No, Moog. That's not what's meant by a ball club.
Actually, we don't hit rocks anymore. You'll need a smaller bat.
Suddenly, Fred remembered he needed to renew his car insurance.
Gronk no have regulation bat. There, understand that?
They did drug test me.
I'd tell you he's throwing real fire tonight, but you have no idea what that means.
I trust you are aware that Sal the Barber is on the mound.
The itchy uniform doesn't mean you can club the pitcher.
I’m all Paleo now.  It’s an Alex Geurrero thing.
Does Paleo really work as well as steroids?
You must be their new journeyman player I've heard about.
Hmmph. Rookies...!
Just crush it.
So what do you guys use for a cup?
Like we practiced: Krug smash."
What farm team did you come from?
You making fun of my posture?
Hey Ump, I don’t think that’s a corked bat, but can you check it?
For the last time - hit the ball, not the other players!
Your team has really gone overboard on these retro uniforms!
T-rex thigh bone?
Me think future lame
Wouldn't you rather play golf, Mr President?
(And they said no one could out-Trump Trump.)
No, It doesn't stand for "Before Curveballs."
How about this? You cool it with the 'paleo-diet' jokes and I won't find out how that mask holds up against this bat?
Yes, his curve ball is magic.
Hey Missing Link! You suck!
I may not know how to play the game, but I know how to use this bat.
Aren't you worried about getting athletes foot?
You know this is not what they mean when they say "hitting one for the ages"
Let's see if a knuckle dragger can hit a knuckleball.
Hey kid, I guess the Steinbrenners aren't enforcing the no-beard rule anymore huh ?
Swing high.
Strike = bad. Fire = good.
It is America's pastime, after all.
There's enough  wood in that bat to make a dozen Louisville Sluggers
Hey, Evan Gattis! How'd you get the approval to not do the uniform standards?
So, just how long HAVE you been on the road?
So that's a "no" to next Sunday with the Wilkersons?
The paleo diet seems to be working!
I never thought I'd get the chance to play against Babe Ruth!
I hear they call you the Bamm-Bammbino.
Trust me, I'm known for the best club hit in town!
The league got carried away with our throwback uniforms this year.
C'mon, Blackmon, you're not fooling anyone.
I wonder what your cup looks like.
What do you mean, you don’t know what a ball is?
Hey, it’s mothing personal but I hear you just got thawed out of ice and have a great batting average so I’m going to start explaining how smartphones work and hope you go Lovecraft-level crazy and have a heart attack before the first pitch comes in
Dad, what are you doing off your couch?
Sorry, bud, we don't have an alley-oop play in baseball.
You look familiar, have we met?
You can't play without regulation shoes!
If your the President's phantom pinch hitter for his favorite team, we don't stand a chance of winning this world series.
It's "Old Timers Day" at Yankee Stadium.
The third baseman, Number 28, Flintstone, Number 28
What I love about baseball is that any game can go on forever.
With the way your teammates are hitting, you’re carrying the club.
I was always good at catching things... you?
I know Johnny Damon. Johnny Damon is a friend of mine. And you, sir...
I’ll bet your Sabermetrics are off the charts.
Have you been in the dugout long?
I certainly hope you’ve got on at least some boy shorts this time.
I get four strikes.
The game ain't what it used to be.
No, the GEICO thing didn't pan out, but I'm batting .785 so far this year and hit a homer to Uzbekistan last week.
You don't hit me, you hit the ball
Does the word 'backswing' mean anything to you?
So -- how long were you in the minors ?
So your the guy they just called up from the Bush Leagues?
Have you seen my club?
Look, I appreciate the whole old-school look, but could you at least take a shower before your next at-bat?
Look, I'm not trying to psych you out. Trust me. If you're allergic to peanuts, don't eat the Cracker Jack.
I am here to speed up the game. This is where I kill you.
No, he said, "Play ball!" Not "Neanderthal!"
Well, if isn’t Fred Flintstone! Glad you finally got called up from the minors!
If Bloog no hit homerun, Bloog lose scholarship.
Yes, the garlic fries are really good here.
What mean, "Fried chicken not welcome on diamond." ?
Yeah,I go free agent in 25,000 years.
Remember I invented fire.
"OK, next we'll try an under-handed lob."
You had the same issue in Savannah, Fred.  The club needs your bat.
I hope it's okay that I brought my own bat...I call it a "cheeto"
I've got no beef with you identifying as paleo, but you've still got to use a standard issue bat.
Move up in the box
You one arm batters are a disgrace to the game!
Batting cleanup, I believe in walking softly and carrying a big stick.
I hear you’re ‘batting 1000’ ‘BC
Ted's Halloween costumes were always guaranteed to be a big hit.
How long have you been their pinch hitter?
It wasn't a good idea for Johnny to explain to him that he's out after 3 strikes.
You part mammoth? Hair must be blocking eye.
You’d make a great Yankee.
Are you still on that paleo diet?
I hope you've discovered fire cause this guy's bringing the heat!
Let's see if you can hit a hairy knuckleball.
Old school.
Yeah, I AM on that paleo-diet. Why do you ask?
Chill:  When I called your manager a Neanderthal, I was just joking!
Jeez, the Yankees really aren't leaving much talent to the other teams.
Still beating your wife?
Were you frozen in the Paleolithic or the steroids era?
This is an agricultural pastime, pal.
There's no squatting in baseball!
I thought the Mets retired that uniform the last time you won a world series?
Still no pitch-clock?
I'm guessing signals will be lost on you.
Hey, You went out ages ago!
Patent or no patent, there's a size limit on bats.
Which minor league were you called up from?
This isn't where I parked my car.
Told to hit one over the fence.  What is fence?
The clubhouse is behind the dugout.
Head's up pal,this is a lot harder than Geico.
Welcome to the big leagues - you’ve been in the minors forever!
I'm not the one who said that the designated hitter rule was   invented by Neanderthals.
I don't care if you are from Louisville. That's not a regulation bat.
Wow, that Paleo thing is really working for you.
Nice try, Pete.
Yes, I know they said it's a club sport, but.....
Was that a cave ball?
It'll take a mammoth effort now to win
Why did they give the gecko a British accent?
I gather you are a power hitter
Hey, how's it going, Ook? What did you have in mind today, fast ball? Slider? Curve? I'll order it right up for ya!
What's wrong with my bat? 
You got a problem with my bat?!
I hate these "retro" games, don't you!
You can definitely play! Everyone is welcome.
Spicy nachos.
FIGURES, ALL THOSE PLAYERS WITH BEARDS WOULD RESULT IN THIS
Has that bat been tested for corking?
How's that throw-back uniform day working for you?
Boy, that Paleo diet has done wonders!
If we're playing by Lascaux rules, you've gotta at least lose the shin guards, bro.
Waiting around for his next pitch can take an ice age.
I take it you're not a big fan of analytics.
You sure? He's got a mean back foot slider.
If I kill it can I drag it home?
Overdid it with the PEDs, I see."
what's really crazy is were playing basketball.
I just clobbered me a wild boar, what did you catch?
That bat looks a little illegal
You know, your really setting back the game!
Looks like pine tar on your pine tree.
I assume you didn't come from the farm team.
Don’t kill rock. Make rock fly.
If Steinbrenner was alive to see what happened to the Yankees...?!
remember when cavemen were, like, a super common trope and cultural object? but then that stopped, in like the 80s? hahaha you're so played out bitch
What do you mean his high heat is like 'fire'?
Ball 4. OK.You may take our base.
Wow - usually it's just the fans that are prehistoric...
It’s all part of the Paleo endorsement deal!
How do you like those new see-thru spikes?
I'm sorry the Stone Age League game is over 3 blocks and back 3 million years.
It’s an honor to play with a Major League club.
Batting cages? No, I said batting ages.
I didn’t think The Neanderthals made it to post-season play.
So you're the new Designated Homo-erectus?
I understand that you're a caveman but you still need to wear a batting helmet.
Hey catcher. How your wife and Ook's kids?
That last pitch was a hell of a brush-back, huh?
That bat is not regulation!
You not want him to pitch inside.
This vintage uniform craze is getting completely out-of-hand.
Why are you speaking so softly?
Just up from the farm club?
So, how was your day?
Just up from Carlsbad?
I'm not prehistoric, I am here as brute force!
Rock, scissors, paper
Defying geologic time and all his life and death struggles in the minor leagues, Zog steps into the batters box for his first at bat in the major leagues.
What's next...a fig leaf?
Give me some heat
Yes, “strike” and “hit” do normally mean the same thing.  No, I don’t see any logic in how those terms evolved.  How about you just stick to being a slugger instead of over-thinking everything?
This paleo thing has gotten out of hand
I was gonna say, “welcome to the Club”.
Our batting coach is getting back to basics.
I've only applied pine tar as delineated by MLB Rule 1.10(c).
So how are the Carlsbad Cavemen doing?
My "Night at the museum" costume party is AFTER the game Miles!
Look, I know this doesn't come easy for you nomads, but your team can't score unless you remember to return home.
1.That uniform is Era-ist.
2.Caveman-Schaveman, you players all look the same to me.
3.Let's get going, my dinosaur is double parked.
4.I wasn't challenging you, and yes I have seen the Geico commercials.
5.Sorry, Grog, that isn't a regulation bat.
No Zog, I keep telling you, he’s gonna throw you a baseball, not a bison.
Me like dead ball era too.
You do know it's a myth that growing it out will actually help you win the World Series, Flintstone.
Tough uniform for Though-back Thursdays
Ever since GEICO bought the team, we have to wear this stupid uniform.  I hate sliding into second!
After you hit the ball, you're supposed to run.
Vyou couldn't hit the broadside of a barn with that thingcouldn't hit the broadside of a barn with that thing
48 inch Brontosaurus drumstick. Good luck Neander.
Can I interest you in the tools of ignorance?
Sorry, it’s not Old Timer’s Day.
Take a walk!
Actually, my mother IS a Neanderthal...
If A-Rod makes it in the hall, they’ve gotta let me in... right
I hear you invented the wheelhouse.
Wow! I haven't seen a Dick Neanderthal model in years.
"I assume you don't know about the new shifts.
Stealing signs is low, even for a Neanderthal.
Didn't I see you in a Geico commercial?
Catch her? You'll never catch her like that!
What are you looking at me for, the ball's coming from the tall guy on the mound over there.
Where I come from that signal means a wild boar is in the area!
So, you wanna do ‘old school,’ eh?
Oh my god, you’re embarrassing me! But yes....I’ll marry you...
Man! The guys out there are caveman!
You’ve got it all wrong...No clubs, we’re the Cubs!!
Listen Bam-Bam, this ain't Neander-ball
No, the Dead Ball Era came after the Mesozoic Era but before the Live Ball Era
New Uniform, Charlie Blackmon?
Three grunts and you're out!
Don't go all Paleolithic on me now, keep it in the strike zone.
Forget this; wait till you see the Jaybirds' new uniforms."
I hate the early innings
From the way he smells, I can tell he's going to hit a foul ball.
The catcher  asks, "You aren't from around these parts, are you?"
You traveled a million years just to strike out!
these alternate uniforms have gone too far.
Sure it's legal: it's the new "Me Too" model from Louisville Slugger.
You know a good spot for beef steak tartare in this town?
After the GEICO contract ran out, Frank decided to see what else was so easy.
Here’s a clue. I’m not going to bunt.
I don't care how it used to be... you are supposed to take the guys out with the ball.
Let's just say my ERA has long since past.
Try not to be nervous. Picture rhem all naked.
How long were you in the minors?
It's batter up, and not batterer up.
There are no actual cubs, no bulls in the bullpen.
Your mom still dating dinosaurs?
The game has evolved since you last swung a club"
They don’t call me a slugger for nothing!
I hate that evolution produced the designated hitter.
I'll start a fire right here
Homer.
Football Practice is one field over
You look very familiar.  Did we play together in the minors?
I spit at the Green Monster.
You be good, you give back.
His fastball is so easy, even you can do it.
Exhibition season's over, Pal.
Sa-wing, early Paleolithic man, early Paleolithic man, early Paleolithic man.
You really let yourself go over the All Star Break huh
Do I hit you?  Is that why you're wearing protection?
Knuckle, as in "ball", not in "dragger."
Me Despondent Homosapien."
Rock, paper or scissors?
Throwback day was yesterday.
Perhaps you're thinking of a different "old ball game."
Did anyone check his bat for a cork?
Yes its called dugout ,not a cave.
I never was too happy about the designated hitter rule.
You really got into this turn-back-the-clock thing, didn’t you?
Does it look like I lost a bet to you, Charlie?
We were thinking of a different kind of baseball club..
Throwback uniforms are tomorrow, Brandon.
you might want to reconsider that signal to the picture.
Why pitcher throw balls? Me only hit rocks!
Sorry Bruno, dinosaur bats aren’t allowed.
When you're a caveman you swing a big club....it's what you do.  When you need auto insurance,you call Geico....it's what you do.
I'm sorry. Bring your own Woolly Mammoth bat was last week."
No kidding?  I used to play for the Carrollton Cavemen, too.
It's a baseball club not club baseball
Tar pit bats are illegal.
Petrified wood?  Petrified me!
No rocks and stones just balls and strikes.
Making it to the Big Leagues is that easy, huh?
No, the pitcher brings the heat - not the fire.
No, the other kind of WAR
You're not playing for a club team anymore.
I'm just saying.  Rule 1.10(a): The bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood.
And your mother is a Brontosaurus
Don't tell me. You got that from the clubhouse.
Green monsters are your thing, right?
The Phillie Phanatic's got nothing on you, kid.
I hate time travel. Everybody dresses so weird.
Last week we had the Genghis Khans here. We surrendered three times to avoid death by torture. Playing  AA ball blows.
How did you know I was the oldest on the team?
Sorry, you can't play.  The MLB now has a dress code.
We've taken the "throwback jerseys" too far.
Are you fitting in? With that beard you're perfect.
you’re making me feel under-dressed
You're out of the box.
You must be the designated Neanderthal.
I guess you didn't hear that big barrels are verboten in this tournament.
I like throw-back jerseys, but that's ridiculous.
For the last time, I'm from the stone age. I never played centerfield for the Colorado Rockies.
Yes, another intentional walk.  We're not stupid, y'know.
These throwback nights are getting out of hand.
Cleats or bare feet are of no consequence; however, chalks chafes a big toe like nothing else."
Watch out this one requires a wide swing.
He can't throw a woolly mammoth and you know it.
If I'm supposed to swing at the ball, I'd suggest you move back a bit.
me yogi!  you fred!
So it frees your arms for a better swing!
No, you're mistaken, I'm not a caveman from the past, I'm a hipster batter from Williamsburg.
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Is that a leather uniform?"
"Yeah, it fits like a glove.
It's a living!
I don't mind your team's weird uniforms, but has that bat been checked for pine tar?
Couldn’t play til after the stone age.
No cork, right?
I'm pretty sure knocking the ump out of the park will not go over well.
I'm Bamm-Bamm Hubbell!
Splitter high and inside, eh! I plan to walk upright to first!
I knew the Mets farm system was thin, but this is ridiculous.
Ogg take your man's ERA  to paleolithic.
Is that a retro uniform?
Don't you think you've taken this whole Paleo thing a little too far?
Welcome back Mr. Bench.
Gonna need a bigger plate.
The bat’s OK, but you have to put on a uniform.”
If you actually manage to hit the ball, run to that base over there to the right.
We’re just past the All-Star break and you guys are 21 games out of first. Don’t you think you’re carrying the stupid post-season beard thing a little too far?
You don't get mad when you strike out, do you?
Hi Mike
I haven’t seen you in ages.
Good to see you again Damon!
But this isn’t the Old Timers game!
The off-the-shoulder fur is a nice look, but the batting helmet is mandatory.
Did you eat the umpire?
No pine tar? Yeah, right, you've got half a damn pine tree there.
Just say’n - your insurance rates might go down if you at least wore a cup.
In the Old Days it was 4 strikes and you were out.
Hit it back to the Stone Age, and then join it.
Can you speak up?
Im here to Kill the Umpire!!!
You swing like your life depends on it.
Well I don't like your ball club either!
Right: How can I trump this?
Left: In a million years.
Saber Tooth Metrics.. its killing our sport...
They said it was casual Friday.
I suppose a helmet is out of the question...
Let me warn you, this pitcher has been known to throw a bean ball that'll knock you back to the Stone Age.
Thats not a regulation bat!
You must be the new guy from the Club Team.
Yes, traditionally we're called a ball club, but...
Your swing is so bad, you look like a caveman killing his lunch.
We don't use it for something as silly as food anymore.
It's called a ball; and it was invented sometime after the wheel.
I hate throwback uniform day
The diet worked so well I'm going totally Paleo.
You know, I batted .300 in the Triple Cave league last year.
Is this the new retro-style uniform?
Our pitching staff is mostly creationists so you'll probably see a lot of forkballs.
Tap your foot. Tap it again. Tap it again. You're out.
Okay, so you killed the ump - you still have to wear a batting helmet.
I was told this is where a man could get a piece of cowhide.
See?  It's not as easy as it looks!
Good luck getting around on the fastball.
Sure, you may have won the Home Run Contest, but Dude, this guy throws some serious junk!
The designated hitter rule has certainly extended your career hasn't it.
You’re kidding!..... You are the designated hitter?
Don't worry, you got this. You're a natural.
Don't tell me, you're trying Paleo...
Looks like you're overdoing that paleo diet, Shorty.
You want to throw me a curve ball? Think again
Your uniform is a lot cooler than mine, but I don't your bat is regulation."
Congress isn't up to bat yet.
Looks like this game just became Pangea's pastime.
Come on, ya must know Freddie Flintstone? Played catcher, yelled "yabba dabba dew"  as the batter swung.
Grasping the concept of 'home plate' may take some time.
Um. Certain rules have been updated since your were last here.
I'm amazed the Yankees let you wear your own uniform!
I tell you this every time you're up to bat. He's only allowed to throw baseballs to us... no live animals, no rival clan members...
See, I'm giving the pitcher the sign for walk.
Up to bat, wearing a throwback jersey...
I like the throw-back uni.
Is that your throwback uniform?
No cleats. No play.
It's America's National Pastime, not Passst Time.
Good thing it's a slow game -- I fell asleep in the locker room!
Looks like your team took a deep dive into the retro-uniform trend.
With the new beard trend, I thought I would go completely old school.
Remember, you're only supposed to hit the ball.
Just give me an extra second to duck
I am in uniform.
A strike is a strike no matter what period your from!
I've been called up from the Neanderthal League
It must not be easy to drag your wife to the playoffs.
All I'm saying is I think they have taken this 'throw back' trend a little too far."
This expansion team business has gone far enough!
Sorry, wrong stadium. The Trump League plays across town.
It was clearly a strike!
The Babe used a bigger bat than that, you wussie!
Do say you Vozzo NOT could park Pence in cheap seats from here
The Louisville Slugger Museum is looking for 
Neanderthal catchers.
Where's your hat?
I know it’s too small to eat, but jut hit it anyway.
As usual, instead of a home run, you caved.
Wr’re going to have to expand the strike zone.
Watch it...hurlers gotta wicked curve rock.
I am the clean up hitter.  Me speak softly, carry a big stick and hit 
the ball far
Did they emphasize it's the ball your supposed to hit and not me?
Now batting for Lascaux - Grog.
Aren't you a little old for a rookie?
Didn't I see you at last year's Old Timers' game?
I’m up from the Neanderthal  League.
Its throwback JERSEY night.. not throwback Homoerectus night
Let's hit a home run.
They'll probably outlaw your bat. but it's worth a try--you never know.
You may have killed it in the minors , kid....
I told the time machine « ump fire »
Throw-back Thursdays has gone too far.
That throwback uniform is timeless!
The Throwback Game is next week.
Let’s see if he can keep this prehistoric performance going.
His batting average has actually improved since he went Paleo.
I went paleo to prepare for this win.
We wear caps and sleeves at this level, Son.” - Lou Brown
(R.I.P. James Gammon
I see your team's gone paleo
NOW PINCH-HITTING FOR CHUCK GRANGER IS SHOELESS JOE VROGG
What is it you don't understand --home or plate?
Who said we play like a Neanderthals?
Your skull may be thick but you STILL have to wear a protective hat!
You need to wear pants . . . unwritten rule.
Going for the "Retro" look with the new uniforms, eh?
No worry, Thag not cork bat.
Last off the bench doesn't mean you bat with the bench.
Three strikes and you're out.
This was the way I used to get to first base.
The  AL really has no shame—a designated Neanderthal???
Time to give 'em something to read about on the cave wall tomorrow.
Any experience hitting things with the bat?
I thought you were more of an artsy type.
I've been on the DL for eons!
Whatever it is, you catch it, I'll whack it, and we'll split it 50/50.
Hey man, this is the majors, not a club sport.
I went along with the lucky beard thing but this is getting ridiculous.
No, we've never met before, this is our team's first time playing against the Piltsdown Pirates.
When are you going to evolve with the game?
Didn't that Time Machine Guy tell you the Wild Card game is in September?
Ugg! Ugg ugg uggg. Ugg?
Your slugging percentage doesn't go up just because you use a club.
So, you're big on the paleo thing.
The de-evolution of man.
Just relax and pretend the ball is a charging rhinoceros.
Your team is on fire this year!
Dude, where’d you get your PEDs?
When I saw we were playing "The Cavemen" today, I thought it was a team name. No wonder the scouting report was lacking.
Oh good! I hate running down bunts.
Batterer up!
Exactly how long did you say you spent in the minor leagues?
He better be good, I’m used to hitting meteorites.
In what cave did the scout find you?
Next at bat... BAM BAMBINO
Wow, Jim Carrey!
"I like strikes not balls."
These retro uniforms are getting ridiculous.
One swing and you’re out
So I hear you're a five primitive stone tool player.
It is Not a corked bat!
After long and careful consideration, Zugg was confident the crouching, masked man was trying to communicate something.
Are you another one of those vintage base ball players?
My nutritionist suggested going Paleo.
Take me to your leader
I would suggest a bunt.
Threw way back for the throwback uniforms huh?
The coach said ‘any caveman can do it’, so I was hired.
I wanted a changeup, not a makeover.
Hey, you're slimming down. Paleo?
I see that the Paleo diet you're on is really working.
A grand says you don't lay one down.
I'm going to hammer this Pitcher out of the park...and your next.
enough of these throwback uniforms !
I see you missed Primal Scream Therapy at practice again.
Can't you use a regular bat? We're getting complaints out in the parking lot.
Remember now, you are supposed to hit the ball, the small white thing the man will throw at you.
Paleo is a diet plan, not a uniform style.
Yep. I'm goin' commando.
Ok.  But please don’t slide.
Are you going to step up to the plate this epoch, or are you petrified?
You're just supposed to hit the ball, not beat it to death and eat it....
The Paleo diet has really improved your stance.
You're throw back night uniform is way back.
I bet you're batting a million B.C.!
The first pitch better be a fastball down the middle or I'm going to knock you back to the Stone Age.
turn back the clock" night has gone too fa
We need to get you in the players union.
Glogball have same rules, but Glog hit by pitch;  you run to first.
Got the look of a mammoth hitter.
I really think a sacrifice bunt might work.
Now up for the Rubble-A, Bedrock No Sox...
No, of course I don't believe in the infield fly rule, that umpire WAS dumb.
Whaddya mean "new club rules"?
So you were called up from the Bedrock Quarrymen.
Great. Knocked out in Jurassic Park.
But We've Always Done It This Way
Yeah, of course we’ve evolved, Bob — now try to hit the little ball with you big wooden stick.
Are you the guy they called up from the Paleolithic  League?
Looks like doping is setting the game back.
Paleo has been real good to my batting average
Ya'll have the best uniforms.
Igor, you've been told before you can only play with a regulation bat.
If you'll promise to bunt, I'll promise to throw the ball into right field.
You really took the whole Nostalgia Day theme seriously...
Player  named from an earlier date?
No, you can't club the pitcher
You silly Neanderthal, you have to dig a hole before you go!
Before the Yankees and the Red Sox, this was the original baseball club.
When are you going to learn how to walk?
Didn't you used to play with the Mammoths?
no place like home
Remember, swing at the ball not my head.
They announced the designated "hitter," not "hunter."
Designated hitter bad for purity of game, but Thog hits when told.
Are we still following those unwritten rules?
Throwback Night, and I'm sincerely glad to be on the Mets.
I thought this was BYOB: Bring Your Own Bat"
"Kevin, when have we ever done that?
Sorry bud, you struck out 10,000 years ago.
They were all yelling ‘kill the umpire’.
H. G  Wells said I could come here......
New Jersey Neanderthals? Whatever, you still have to wear proper cleats.
The Incel League plays tomorrow.
Hey, clubber clubber, hey clubber!
Home run or strike out. You're the true face of baseball today.
You scared away the ump.
You look a little under dressed to play this game slugger.  Go to the locker room and get into uniform.
Glad you showed up for old-timers day
No, sorry, I haven't seen a wooly mammoth come through recently.
Aren't you a bit old to be playing baseball?
Wow Damon. You've really let yourself go.
Kill the Umpire" is just a saying, kid
The field trials you're looking for are in the Bad Lands of South Dakota.
I'm lookin' for the club house.
Is there a good way out of here?
I hit to all fields.
How long have you been with your club?
I AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE CAVEMAN TEAM. 
WHERE ARE THE ROCKS?
Arnold, did you get a new haircut and bat -- you are going all out for the final game.
Charlie, here comes the deuce. When you learn how to speak of me, speak well.
No, you've made a mistake - this is a BASEBALL club, not a CAVEMAN's club.
Abner Doubleday!  What are you doing here?!
You've got to work harder on the walk softly part
Your wife is hot. 
Did she invent fire?
Kill the ump wasn't meant literally.
You obviously didn't get the email blast. Luddites rescheduled to play next week.
I hear you needed a slugger.
How long have we been in extra innings?
So you started before the designated hitter rule?
Called up from the Neolithic League, Aye?
Get up buddy, it's Homo erectus time.
Just pretend it's a tiny mastodon.
Me want meatball over the plate.
Remember, you're hitting it OUT not DOWN!
Give him a second. He's never faced a batter who wasn't chewing something.
And people say the Yankees is an old boy's club
As the Designated Hitter I hope you know that you are only allowed to hit the ball.
I just got traded from the club league.
For the last time, the count is one ball and more than one strike, there's more than one man on base, and the score is more than one to more than one.
Are you here to make America's pastime great again?
Just called up from the Mesolithic?
Man, who dressed you? Where are your socks?
Sorry,aluminum bats only in this league.
Let's see if he's ready to discover fire.
I hope you've got big balls.
Both Ted's (Roosevelt & Williams)
Said walk softly and carry a big stick so here I am!
One more way inside like that, and you'll get to join my club.
So caveman walked onto a baseball field, with one catcher...
Ok, it’s three strikes you’re out at the NEW ballgame.
So, doing it 'old school', huh?
News Flash: he's not intimidated by the caveman schtick.
Tough break Mike. I heard they're sending you back to the Pleistocene League.
Clan of Cave Bear in last place.
Me no dope
Don’t tell me we go back to all fours.
I'm sorry, but batting helmets aren't optional.
I don't know about you, but I think this "throwback uniform" thing has gone too far.
I knew doping was a thing, but didn't realize cryonomics was.
I've heard of waiting for a pitch, but you sir are ridiculous!
Say that again.
No batter, no batter, seriously, no batter!
Just picture the face of your worst enemy. Or a woolly mammoth.
Don't even try reading my signs."
Must have been a really long stint on the DL.
Another call-up from the B.C. affiliate.
It’s one,two, three clubs you’re out!
It's about time they brought the designated caveman to the National League.
Its a Lascaux Slugger.
Well, you certainly look Robust, but I really think I should compliment you on your Erect posture.
Not me.
Wow, it wasn't a type-o on the schedule. You fellas really are The Clubs.
I'm the substitute outfielder....so don't give me that stare down!
I'm a heavy hitter.
Great look. Who's your beardsmith?
We got a new uniform sponsor.  Abercrombie and Caveman.
I don't believe it either.  They finally called me up.
I will now hit you in the head with a vintage bat
I told you there is more to Life than just hunting and gathering.
Got tired of staring at fire all the time?
I guess you figured the bare feet took care of the "walk softly" part.
Babe, What?
This has gotta be, what, your 66 millionth Old -Timer's Day?
Hand signals?  You're such a Neanderthal.
Sorry--No shirt, no shoes, no service.
Bill, it's Saber-metrics
Listen, I'm just happy our team didn't make us wear "Turn Back the Clock," jerseys from the Garden of Eden.
...And up to the plate is Moog McGregor, 
who was grandfathered in before bat size regulation rules
Lucky you. I gotta wear nylon.
This time swing at the ball and not my head.
Gronk steps up to the plate. No hits yet this game, but let’s see if he can discover fire in the sixth
Do think a new bat will help my batting average?
I'm guessing this isn't your first Old Timers' Day.
You should really cut down on those anabolic steroids!
You're supposed to knock the BALL out of the park, not the pitcher.
Being called up from the minors is tough!
Your throwback jerseys are really old school.
What do you wearing, mister? Where is the cowhide I brought you?
Throw the rock
PEDs are really ruining this game...
No, you may not hit everyone at Home when you hit a Run.
Yes,you do use steroids!
Me hit, you sit.
Some bat ya got there, pal, but I don’t think it’s regulation.
You must be the player to be named later.
Man, that Paleolithic diet really changed you
Johnny Damon?  I thought you were retired.
...and Heather goes, like, ‘Do your zits glow in the dark?’
I won't need cleats.
Do you only bam bam fastballs?
If I told him to fire one over the plate, would you even understand?
I bet you salary I can hit ball.
This is the best player they got?
They sorry for you, so I'm here on your great,great,great,great,great,great and so on......behalf!
I'm from the old school of hard rocks.
It was a regulation bat when I benched.
I forgot the sign for "Wild Batter"
It's not true that the game is always devolving.
But why me?"
"I guess because the light was on...
There is no joy in Mudville - mighty Caveman has struck out.
Um...you gotta face the pitcher, not me
Shoeless Joe Jackson didn’t wear shoes, so the commissioner had to approved it.
Good luck, Thag, my guy has the eye of the Ilyaxtertheosarus tonight.
Modern grooming, original uniform. It works, rookie!
You Rockies have real authentic throwbacks this year!
I presume you don’t have much occasion to slide.
Put it back in the clubhouse.
I guess the Mets have completely given up this year.
Things are a little different now.  You can try to knock the skin off the ball, but not the pitcher.
Are you sure you’re in the right park??
They said a guy just got called up. I thought they meant ‘minors’ not ‘Paleolithic.’
Supper at Mama Leone's tonight after the game?
Purists...
Ghaardurv was on the ice so long, he figured he'd try another sport.
No DNA test is going to save your team if you strike out one more time!
Don't you recognize me, I am the new Batman, it's me Donald.
This time, don’t throw your club at the pitcher. We only have two left.
The way you’ve been killing it has some of us thinking about going on the Paleo diet too.
I love old timers day. Seems so long ago
Ug like fastball brontosaurus high.
This one's for the record books.
Beard, hair, the throwback uniform-you're gonna fit right in.
I joined club baseball.
Three strikes. It's a law.
The whole 'Fear the Beard' thing was bad enough, but those throwback uniforms are a bit too much, Dustin.
I know you it wouldn’t matter if  you got hit, but you should put on a helmet.
It’s not my national pastime.
Just be sure you swing at the ball, not my head.
Hey, rookie. They say you're a 5 tool ball player. Too bad none of your "tools" involve baseball.
Me slugger!
Paleo league call-up?
Dugout - Cave_Cubs - Clubs_All I want to know is your bat illegally corked?
Who do you think invented baseball? Abner Doublerock.
I'm just saying- maybe you've taken the playoff beard concept too far.
I was just called up from the Jurassic League!
Just called up from Lascaux?
Do your knees hurt from squatting?
Sure, I'm the 'unevolved' one for doping the bat instead.
It's o.k., I am a club player
Are you evolved enough for this?
One Cave Run pitch...coming Up!!!
Not that kinda club.
I don't know how you guys run in those uniforms.
Are you a member of the other club?
Gee, thanks!  I will indeed join you in the clubhouse after the game.
To recap, it's the bottom of the grunt, there are 2 grunts on, and you're down by 3 grunts.
Welcome to the Bigs kid: but you ain't in JurrasicPark anymore
Can you use rocks instead of those funny leather things?
Hi, I assume you are joining the Club.
What are we hunting today?
You and Tim Tebow, get a life.
Hit the ball, not my head!
You use saber tooth tiger metrics?
My team needs a big hit.
Cork in the bat? That's at least a century away!
I hate the new DH rules.
Look, I'm tired explaining the rules, figure them out yourself.
Looks like 'roids are back in, huh?
I’m gonna hit a cave run.
So it's true you're having a ball with the baseball club
Sorry, I don't catch boulders.
Okay, but if they say you're using too much pine tar, don't bash me.
Did nobody tell you? It’s Throwback Day.
Hit... the BALL... Ogg... no, I can not be your mate...
The K is backwards. Not you. Kc. KK...backwards K. ‘K?
Due to climate change, a lot of the permafrost is melting. Good news: 42 thousand year old frozen worms have come back to life. Bad news: Defrosted caveman don't really get baseball.
We  made some progress after  the  Yankees forced the  salary cap.
Nah. We cut it to 154 in favor of one more playoff round—long time ago.
Any cork in that bone?
I play for the Washington DC Cavemen
I'm gonna put you outta business.
Swing before the ball gets to me!
You Barbarians really went all out on the uniforms, huh?
Yea, well bigger bat, bigger fence.
I just think The Barbarians is an insensitive team name, that's all.
Paleo pitch catching has improved my posture.
Watch the backswing
You didn't evolve??
Your bat and uniform may be different, but the beard and hairstyle are the same.
We are playing Mudville, right?
You must be the veteran of the club.
Is that the best evolution can do for the game?
You do remember the difference between 'foul' and 'fowl', right?
You're going to see a great curve ball, not a cave ball.
Got any naked pictographs of your wife? Wanna see some?
You got pine tar on that bat, Rookie?
I got benched about fifty thousand years ago. I am back on the field now.
And tomorrow is Renaissance day
Really committing to the paleo thing eh, Aaron?
Remember -if you are hit with the ball, don't hit me.__
I don't care how thick your skull is.  You need to wear a helmet!
I suggest not sliding.
They really got to cap the extra innings rule.
We're going to be in big trouble if we have to wait for you to invent running.
Lefty doesn't walk many batters, ya know.
You need a regulation helmet.
When man on small hill throw rock, you wait-- three times. Then free wildebeest meat yours.
He’ll throw it again, but this time try hitting it, not him?
Look who just got called up from the Paleo League.
Anouncer: “and in the top of the 1300bc, from team homosapiens its homo-troglodytes taking on Smilodon of team carnivores”
Something tells me you're not a bunter
Your retro uniforms sure are serious this year.
Rookie of the year ?  Seriously ...
Strike. Zone. STRIKE. ZONE.
Move over Rookie
Been in the minors a long time?
Three strikes and you're --   Never mind.
Go right ahead- take your base.
You would think with your batting average you'd at least have a shoe contract.
How long have you been sitting in the dugout?
We’ve done the Sabre-metrics on you.
No you can't see our sign for fire.
Man, what's your ERA?
Is that an Olduvai Slugger?
So you're the new guy with the ball club.
Look who it is: ‘Wheels’, the fire starting pinch hitter.”
I don't know what game you are playing.
So because it’s not technically a bat, you’re telling me regulations don’t apply?
Snappy uniform. Where can I get one like it?
Well, look who was finally called up from the Paleolithic leagues.
SABR-toothed metrics are really changing the game.
If you want to succeed, you have to evolve with the game.
Throwback uniform goes with the beard.
This home run doesn't lead to a cave.
One more homer and this will be a 500 club.
Yes you can hit the ball, but there are rules."
Me come up from Double A Pleistocene.
Two mutton chops say you walk
What are you overcompensating for this time?
The Mets really are going back to basics.
I'm sure your bag will get here tomorrow
You may be good with saber-toothed cats, but let’s see how you handle sabermetrics.
Most of my career has been in the minor leagues.
Is this the clubbing scene?
A bunt would be nice.
Is that a Louisville Slugger?
Been in the dugout awhile?
The "Save Rule" has been changed again. Other than that, it's the same game.
Hey, that thing isn't regulation.
Where did you get that? Out of the bat cave?
I hate playing in Boston on Fan Appreciation Day
You still have a weak ball club.
So, you're the new pinch hitter I've heard so much about.
Aww...mighty Grog has struck out. Uh, jjjust kiddin'!'
Remember you hit the ball and not my head.
I could use an outfit like that.  Where’d you get it?
Yes, it is a solid wood bat, and yes, it is a Louisville Slugger.
Wow! Best throwback uniform ever!
Tonight?  Sure, but the bouncer won't approve that outfit.
Did you read the rules? You are supposed to hit the ball out of the park and not out of the country.
Be careful sliding into s second.
Let me guess. You still think RBIs are a telling stat?
It's barbarian the limits they'll go to get a good pinch hitter.
Jeez, glad to see you finally made it to the big leagues!
I have medicine to help with that.
Don't look at me. I'm strictly new-school.
So, how do you like your throwback uniforms?
Wrong Club
You make me feel so overdressed.
You must be the troglodytey Casey.
Remember, try not to kill it
You need some head gear, this pitcher really throws a rock.
My wife went hunting with the smaller bat
What? So easy a caveman can do it.
Could I interest you in an intentional walk?
With all de respect, you were called up from the minors 1,600 years ago.
This is the first time an expansion club went backwards.
I'll give you a slugger, alright.
You have taken this Paleo diet thing way too far.
So, have you read Moneyball?
Two things pal, one is your pants are still on, and two is, you need to dig a hole. I'm not the cleanup hitter
If they haven't invented cork where you're from yet I don't think there'll be a problem.
Throwback uniforms are the worst
You don't have any protective gear? We sent away the umpire to limit co-lateral damage.
Listen, old-timer: when a fan screams 'kill the ball,' they don't mean 'beat it to death.'
That's probably not a regulation bat..."
Swing away. No missing links out there.
So, I guess you’re batting cleanup?
What's your problem, baseball is stuck in the stone ages.
Picture the ball as the personification of your life angst at being down in the count 0-2.
You've taken this role playing too far, Jimmy.  And I know the plate is facing the wrong way.
I have no idea why my wife left me.
This time I'd appreciate it if you'd swing at the ball and not my head.
Paleo I can understand. It's those Crossfit types that take it too far.
Aren't you the mascot for the Nashville Neanderthals?
I hope you had that weighed first.
Hey, Joe! So how’s the Paleo Diet working for you?
Could be worse. Our throwback uniform is a fig leaf.
Ya know he can throw spitball with a rock!
I've been waiting for beards to come back.
Hey, didn't you used to play in the Neolithic Leagues?
I only work for football players
What you really need to try is going keto
As long as it's not corked.
Maybe you've spent too much time in your man cave...
Designated hitter from Jeraicic Age uses Trex Femur
Okay...but we're using a smaller ball.
They're pin stripes, it's a Yankee thing.
Your thrifty team owner buys primitive uniforms & bats but you can at least shave & shower before a game!
Are you sure you won't hit me"
"Rahhhhh.
We're going to pitch you outside.
Playing to his base" is more a figure of speach.
Hey, clubber clubber clubber clubber. Sa-wing clubber!
Go ahead. Clobber it.
Forget your helmet?
Wade?
Is paleo working for you?
I don't think you can use a mastodon leg as a bat.
Hey this ain't the old-timers game!
OK slugger, slam it back to the Pleistocene.
Stop looking at me like that! I told you I'm not an Ankylosaurus!
A batter is a . . . oh, never mind!
Okay Ork. He knows the squeeze bunt's coming.
Thankfully,I'm out of the strike zone.
I promise, I won't hurt you!
Exactly how long were in the minor leagues before they finally called you up?
Are you a member of the club?
So I hit the ball, but don’t run after it?
If you strike out, I swear to God, I'll send you back to the museum.
Don't you like these throwback games?
'Step back' didn't mean that far.
You sure that bat is regulation?
Club level? Sure, behind you.
Dude, great throwback uni.
I love these Old Timers' games.
Is that one of those new Cretaceous Slugger bats?
Hey, Old Timer's Day is NEXT Sunday!!
Did that club keep the Yankees from making you shave and get a haircut?
You just got called up from triple A Neanderthal?
How dare you suggest I've been taking steroids!
'Well, you know it's not corked."
We didn't use protection in my day.
Throwback uniform day?
Designated Hitter, huh? Do you know what a ball is?
I'm afraid if you want to fight dinosaurs you need to talk to the rugby coach.
damn right I choke up
Who's the new guy?
If you hit it, remember to run!
I told them I ran from home. They tell me I would be helpful here!
I know big beards are in right now man but don't you think you're taking it too far with this caveman getup?
You catch three pound rocks
Monkey, no catch!
The day random PED testing stopped being be so random.
My pitcher's ERA is 2.19. What's yours?
This time, don't catch the ball and eat it!
Aren’t you guys taking throwback day a little too far?
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful franchise for you and your sidekick Robin.
Gnursh.
ME...LIKE...SABERMETRICS
When do I bat you?
Take it back to the clubhouse.
The National League is still holding out on the designated hitter rule, I see...
If you hit a home rum make sure you don't flip that bat in my direction.
Are you from the the Neanderthal league?
Yeah, budget cuts - but on the plus side we picked up more international pool money.
Listen, you gotta hang on to your bat.
You have to tell me every damn time...   "No DH in the good old days."
Don't blame me, skipper's gone old-school.
No, “strike three” doesn’t mean you hit me three times!  You actually have to take that up with the Ump”
Oh so you're the bunter-gatherer everyone's talking about.
You ain't got no chance...his knucklerock ia a killer.
Boxers, no. Briefs, no. Leopard skin loincloth, no. I'm telling you, you'll never guess!
Size queen...
Sorry, didn't mean to ice you for that long.
These new rookies play ball like a bunch of Neanderthals.
Great, another "throwback" jersey day.
You cannot use that bat.
Can we switch positions?  I mean in all aspects.
Looks like we've blown through stupid and have landed in Neanderthal.
Judge hit ball
How many times have you been back to the minors?
Really try to hit it this time because my doctor said I need to avoid any more rocks to the face.
At the sight of Urg the Destroyer, the catcher came close to supplying an unrequested urine sample.
It’s our Paleo uniform.
Org know me not turtle?  He no think I am food because I am over plate?
Hey, Paleo Man, got any hot dogs?
It's not a big meatball and if you eat another one, you're out.
It's called baseball, man. There're rules, and that club of yours won't pass as a bat.
Ya might have some trouble. He’s got a fantastic cave ball.
Is that bat a pleistocine slugger?
You might want to dial it back a bit on the steroids.
New look.  Well, I warn you.  Our pitcher throws fireballs.
You've been moved up in the order, hub?
I'll trade you a Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb for your card.
Hey...you're the free agent with special dress and equipment clauses. Played last season for the Wooly Mamaths in France.  Let me move back a bit."th
So, ya finally up from the farm?
The rose goes in the front, big guy
The Yankees are paying me 
40 million shiny rocks a year
You need some spikes.
That's not a legal bat.
Hey batter batter batter, don't swing batter batter.
I think you forgot your batting helmet.
You do realize that is not what the term Ball Club means don't you?"
Wow! Talk about a 'throwback' uniform.
What comes after two?
I am here to beat the crap out of that asshole David Remnick, not hit some dumb ball.
Man hit ball now.
Again, this inning and all innings will be a 'no hitter.' Understood?
Wait till you see our cleanup hitter, he's a mammoth."
Four dusters coming your way.
Those measures to speed up the game aren't working very well
Well, if it isn't Club Ned?!
From Tom Potter: "Let's see what your back-to-basics approach can do in the big leagues."

From Stephen West:  "Dang! I forgot it was Classic Uniform Day."

“Many folks don’t know that baseball is really the oldest profession.”
You know that we’re using sabermetrics on how to pitch to you, right?
I'd like a Smilodon on rye.
Are you one of Donald Trump's hit men?
We don't have a signal for wild pitch.
Well it's..uh...ballasuarus..uh..food..and it's gonna come fast. so....
Batter Ugh!
I don’t care if the emerald ash borer has killed more than 50 million of the ash trees used to make baseball bats. That stick is non-regulation!
It's baseball, not Neander-ball.
When the ump yelled, “Play Ball,” he meant ...!
Yo, batter I slept with your w...whoa, uh, hey big fella!
Sorry, buddy - cricket tryouts are next door.
To clarify, strikes no get fire.
We don't serve up meatballs.
You ain't gettin a cave run off a me, pal.
Back up from the Pleistocene League, eh Flintstone?
No, this is not the old-timers’ game!
I should have just finished college
A unempire  where's my wife."
Patrick McGuire Waldorf ,MD
He'll get you with his past ball.
I'm sorry to hear your teammates got stuck in the pine tar.
Normally I would say 'you're guess is as good as mine', but not this time.
Where are your cleats?
Are you looking for food on your plate?
I told you he can't put a dinosaur in this comic.
Coach really convinced them the rulebook only applies to Homo sapiens?
This game has been going on for ages!
I beat him, Homie!
When the Umpire said "Strike One," he didn't mean...never mind, just leave the bat here, and run like hell.
This at bat could set a club record.
Sorry, Neand, but here we only use Louisville Slugger bats.
Flintstone said the same thing and ended up in the hospital.
Wanna hang out after the game?
Let me guess, you’re on a Paleo diet?
Did you forget that it's Casual Friday?
It's time we got back to basics!
No, you may not club the other guy! Just hit the ball.
Why is everyone yelling "Run Home" ?
Man, you've rocked Old-Timers Day!
It wasn't an ethnic slur, I said, "Stay out of the CAGE, not CAVE!"
Nothing has progressed in one million years, so you should be right at home.
You'll invent the wheel before this bum gets one past you.
Paleo diet
Really! That's your team's new outfit?
So my wife sometimes calls me a Neanderthal, guess that's a good thing?
Not the national past time...
If you hit me with that thing, you are going back to your cave.
Yep, a little 6o’s but Bam Bam is all grown up!
See this diamond shape. You’re welcome.
For the last time, Pete Rose, the answer is “No!”
Are you in the official line-up?
No batting gloves??? Are you crazy?
So... you're Charlie Blackmon's brother
Well that's a unique way of eliminating the strike zone.
I can't call it 'The Thinking Man's Game'  anymore with a batting average that high...
Lighten up, man. You're the first Neanderthal to make it to the big leagues."

Tom Pilarzyk, Shorewood, Wi
Oh yeah, it's Old Timer's night.
Remind me.  Is it kill the umpire or kill the catcher?
The bay boys are getting older each season
It's not that kind of clubhouse.
It should be easy. He's trowing stones.
I was called up yesterday from the Flintstone League.
No. I can't tell you why the song says 'Buy me some peanuts AND Cracker Jack' when Cracker Jack is already loaded with peanuts.
Don't judge me, mister!
Buddy, we said to get a man cave.
Tell your pitcher - one more inside pitch and I'll knock him back to the Mesozoic Era!
Johnny Damon up to bat for the Chicago Clubs.
Bring us something big for the after-game cookout.
Why aren’t you wearing cleats, dude?
These throwback jerseys have really gotten out of control
Get called up from the Jurassic League?
I'm making up for my vegan phase.
I don't know about the rules down in Bedrock, but here a helmet is mandatory!
Hey Bryce, your beard looks great with the new throwback uniforms.
Make this one for the prehistory books.
This is the best outfit for ball games.
"Ball."  . . . "Club."
Epic throwback jersey bro!
You must be one of the Late Pleistocene call-ups.
C'mon Flintsone, let's see you knock it outta the park!
Do you think that these throwback uniforms have gone a little too far?
bunt it - don't eat it
Helmet rule waived, but no batting gloves?
And you’re the EPA Chief? What a renaissance man.
Thats what she said!
I heard of throwback Thursday, but this is ridiculous!
Me just learn to walk.
Are you batting clean-up or clan out
Try striking the ball not the batter.
The game has really evolved since back in the day
My life isn't a game for your amusement.
You forgot to wear your batting helmet.
So you're the cave man slugger everyone is talking about!
No Bob, I don't think that's what they had in mind for the 'Throw Back' uniforms.
This isn't Bedrock, rookie. Put a damn helmet on.
Sorry there are no dames on the other team.  Try to hit the ball instead.
Barney made it to second!
I like your style.  On the Yankees, beards are forbidden.
I hate classic uniform day
This is an old times game,isn't it?
Ringer?
You can't keep fighting it. Analytics are here to stay.
So you've been on that Paleo Diet?
Donald, you can not win the game by beating everyone up with a club!
Throwback nights. Another reason I'm proud to be a Yankee.
Yes, B.C. could stand for Batter Courageous.
No.  I don't  we have a pine tar pit nearby.
you might want to tuck your skirt up.
You are too early, The "Hot Stove" league begins after the world series are over
No...I am not woman... keep your eye on the damn Ball !
Bam Bam in the big leagues
Good luck, caveman!  He’s been clocked at 
upwards of 5890 cubits per minute...whew!
Just pretend it's a pterodactyl egg.
Walk-off home run? You can barely walk upright.
Life was good to Bam-Bam after his folks got over their retro lifestyle.
Let me know if I get hit by stray pitch, will ya?
This game is barbaric.
Is that an ORIGINAL Louisville Slugger?
The throwback uniforms craze has gone a bit too far.
If that's not a throwback uniform, than you really are a hipster.
No. I said knock it into the stone age!
Your toenail length is against the Yankees' appearance policy.
If you slide home, its gonna hurt!
They invented time travel, and the first thing they did was take me here.
I didn't say it was a bat.  It's a club, from the clubhouse.
It’s simple. Just imagine it’all dinner.
Wow, Babe Ruth's bat was only 54 ounces!
Okay,you can call it a Cave Run
I thought you went extinct like the Expos.
I don’t care how big your bat is.  But, you do have to have a baseball cap on.
Neanderball.
Hey!  The pine-tar rubbed off from my uniform.
Sorry it's been so long. He specializes in slow balls.
I don't know what the MLB rules say, but I do know that the batboy just got a hernia from having to lug that around.
How long have you been on the Paleo diet?
Me not hurt you — no need protective gear!
We have to check that bat for cork.
Remember, the only thing you should hit with that big stick you have is a white ball.
That's Really old-school baseball.
He has lost so much off his fastball even a caveman can hit him. By the way I just saved 15% switching to GEICO...
I wrote your name in the baseball field, Klossner
I don't care what they  told you.  Baseball rules say that you  have to wear a cap.
We're not that kind of a club.
No jockstrap,  not a problem.
I thought we were playing the LA Angles, not the Teen Angels
I thought you already got three strikes
Bunt sign
Didn't they tell you, the old-timers game is next week.
Go back to what you call “the cave” and find a regulation bat.
This is the one time it's okay to swing your club.
Did they just bring you up from the Developmental League?
I know this is baseball,but do you have to be such a thug?
No shoes, no serve.
I see your fans really turned out. Dem rocks idiot
Fortunately, Old Timers' Day comes but once a year.
My next hit is going to be fire.
I hope you’re not disappointed that you can only hit balls instead of heads here.”
And yet this game is still average length at this point.
I think you took "throwback uniform day" a little too far.
Aren't you a little old to be a rookie?
where is your batting helmet?
You guys really know how to do dress down Friday’s.
Geriatric night at Yankee Stadium
You do know about the new steroid policy don’t you?
You have to hit that round white thing not my head.
I promise you, the idea is to swing st the ball not the ref
Going the way of politics, I see. Look to the left and hit the next one out of the park . . .
Guess you never heard of George Brett!
Hey, Caveman Carter!  Man, you were in the minors for a long time.......
The Beard works, but the pine tar has to go.
Now Pinch-hitting for the Home Team...
Love the retro uniform look!
Catcher: "you ready for the curveball?"
Caveman: "what's a curveball?"
Our pitcher is Cro-Magnon, carves his own rocks and hates Neanderthals...have a nice at bat.
15 minutes could save you 15% or more....
You know, beards are so last year.
Grarff frugl moog.
Bob and Oog couldn’t help but maintain eye contact long enough for the bench to notice
The future ain't what it used to be.
And I suppose Fred Flintstone plays First?
What?!
They said to bring your own bat and gloves.
Sluginski, you've taken 'Throwback Night' to a whole new level.
You're gonna cave,man.
The old timers game was last week.
OK Slugger, let's see what you've got.
The spin of the ball creates a partial vacuum on one side so...
They call my gear "the tools of ignorance," but your bat is simply archaic.
I've always wondered about Youkilis's ancestry.
You’re playing against the wrong club.
Y'know, you're throwing us quite a curve ball here.
So you guys are bringing up the big lumber huh?
Sure baseball has a long season ... but eons!
Before baseball was invented, what use was the bat?
These cross promotional events are getting out of control -- today we are sponsored by a local BBQ restaurant
Hey rube, spent a few years in the minors?
Are you really, REALLY sure that wasn't a ball?
I feel the same way! The modern equipment doesn't match up. My shin guards and chest protector are made of tortoise shells.
Wow, cool, Man, could it even knock me back to The Stone Age?
He won't pitch to you because your not in uniform.
If you don't a homer, your going back to the stone-age!
You can drag your knuckles, but not our knuckleball.
Is that a regulation uniform?
What's your problem buddy? Never seen a Neanderthal before?
Looking at you, I"m overcome with nostalgia foe the days before indoor plumbing.
ONE strike and I'm out!
Now that's what I call a major league baseball club!
I think you forgot your shoes.
You forgot your clubbing helmet.
Shoes!  ... regulations you know.
Hey buddy, some guy already took that nickname.
Dude, we don’t have an offensive line.
Thanks for removing the spike, Thog. We’ve been going through catchers like crazy!
Didn’t you used to play for the Cro-Magnums?
Remember this time... Harold, my head is not the ball !
I’m guessing you went to college at Prinstone or Shale.

How long you been playin' with the Westside Wooly Mammoths?
Those throwback uniforms seems a little too far back.
Feeling lucky?
Excuse me sir, I’m don’t know if the rules have changed since the Stone Age, but the goal of the game is to hit the ball and run around the bases, rather than pound me into oblivion.
Been waiting long?
Use a bat, they're running out of balls.
For your information, that is not a Louisville Slugger.
I'm not loving these new throwback uniforms.
That paleo diet’s good for power—but you still can’t hit a curve.
You know if the Yankees trade for you you're gonna have to clean up your act a bit.
'Pinch hitter' is just an expression, so stop it.
I love the retro uniform.  Are you sure the bat is not corked?
So are you on the Paleo diet, too?
Don’t you think you’ve taken the  throwback jersey concept,  just a little too far?
Yea the club is nice, but I'm still going to recommend the cup
Wow, this game has really devolved.”
You won't run to first unless something's chasing you?
Hey old-timer still think you got some stick.
I hit you or the ball - your choice.
I thought Neanderthals were opposed to the designated hitter rule.
You have to hit the ball, not the pitcher.
Me still wait for pitching coach to leave mound!
I think you are misunderstanding the concept of what a baseball club is...
I made a home run.
How many throwback uniforms do you guys have?
Your retro-uniform goes a little too far back...
I know this this is Old Timers’ day but this is taking it a bit too far.
Gee, how do you scum of Earth live with that much political correctness?
That's a major league ball club.
Ball is like wheel?
Aren’t you a little old for “make a wish “
Well, it’s definitely not a T-Rex..
That's  right.  I represent  the dugout club.
Hey, buddy:  is that uniform regulation?
I'm on the paleo diet. You got a problem with that?"
Before being traded, I was the Yankees' DH
This new international player exchange program sure makes the game interesting...
Is that a bat or a drumstick?

You're out ... of your cave

WHAT Team are you on? Cavemen or Dinosaurs?
What’s a home run!
What transgender designation are you?
No I said, I am not taking a knee. Have you never heard of a double negative?
I'm just here to do anything to help the club.

So Stephen Hawking finally did invent and a time machine, and this is what we get?
OK buddy, you're safe! Just don't hit me!
Sorry, Bud. You're in the wrong place. No women on this field ...
I get the feeling you'll be tough to rattle.
Knock it out of the Jurrasic park, buddy.
Yep, if you come play for us you'll have to shave that beard

Your taking this man cave thing, too far!
Thats not a regulation uniform for this time period
It's ball or strike.  No mates.
Do you really have to scream "bamm-bamm" every time you hit the ball?
The scout convinced me that after crushing skulls  swatting  a baseball would be childs play.
Oh. I rush the mound cuz he hit me with a pitch and *I’m* the Neanderthal?
What happens to the batter on deck?
Look at that dinosaur on the mound.
I've seen monkeys take better swings!
I know you're a Neanderthal. You still have to wear a batting helmet
Have you seen my wife?
I'll be Neantherthal over you if you hit one of my balls.
If you are planning to slide feet first into the bases, I hope you are wearing underwear.
That's not at all what I meant by a 'Meatball'
Tools of ignorance,right?
What's all this crap about balls and strikes!
Yup, I'm the opposing club.
Down here in the farms we actually travel a lot.
You know, your dugouts here remind me of my cave.
They made us wear camouflage yesterday.
Busted-I left my cleats in the cave.
Jeez, with the Tariffs on Foreign products, we're going back to the Stone Ages
Those old school uniforms are totally pterodactyl

It's not PEDs! I am doing the Paleo Diet.
Gonna try and hit yourself a caverun there, Fred?
Word is that the studio did not have enough money to buy the rights to another Marvel superhero...
Concentrate on the ball ... Don't even think about hitting me !
Ok, give me your cell phone to use Google translate to know about this ancient writing.
Why can't you just accept that the designated hitter is here to stay?
Hate to be a buzzkill, chief, but people nowadays expect delivery of customized, even gluten-free, meals in the stands.

Fast Ball to the head, and don't miss!
Just called up from the millennium league
Yes,I am the new rookie from the Cave league
I ‘m told you also do anaytics
Sorry, but the DH is only in the American League.   This is the National League, and pitchers have to bat.
So I guess you bat alt-righty.
Long time, no see, Neander.
Even though I'm juicing they still call this the dead ball era.
Repeat after me . . .  Hit. Run. Out. Hit. Run. Out.
Hi, I'm here for the club tryouts.
Sure. Blame the club.
Not my fault! I warned that Ump that I have a vicious over-swing!
How are things down  in the Neanderthal League?
Facial hair is one thing...
This interleague experiment has gotten way out of hand.
Dad! What are you doing here?!?
You’re with a good club.
Where'd you get that ridiculous uniform?  

Now batting for the  Neanderthals, ..... 

The Babe is back!
It's a Bedrock game again
Yes, you hit it. No, you don't get to eat it.
That looks more like stone, than maple, hickory, or ash
"You up from the minors?"
Wow! Is that the new Louisville Slugger?
For the last time, this isn't a costume party.
Dude, you've never hit the curve ball and you never will.
When I said you'd have money to burn, I didn't mean literally.
This is the Farm League, son. Time to put on your Homo Erectus pants.
Uh, I think you went to the wrong clubhouse
Do you know that you can't use a 'corked' bat?
So how are things in the bat cave?
Don't call me Babe and don't call me Ruth. I walk softly and carry a big stick; they call me Caveman Hank.
In. this. league it's all. about eugenics.
Wow, is that the new primitive clubber?
I know it isn't regulation but the club is wonderfully balanced.
Don't throw nothin' but heat.  He ain't even discovered fire yet.
They gave it to me in the clubhouse. One doesen't argue with the clubhouse"
You hit me with that thing and you will be out forever!
Is that your rhythm stick?
One of those pinch hitters from the Pro-Magnon League, I presume?
A "K" could be devastating for you...just sayin'
Sorry , you need a regulation bat!
I'm just sayin, that better not be filled with cork
You must be from the new ball club.
Wow, It's hard to believe that I finally made it to the Big Leagues!
You just up from the Minors??
In Baseball; ERAs are irrelevant. What matters is how you approach the current batter.
Well, you should have some expertise after all these years in the game"
Atlatler up!
Introducing the 21,456 BC MVP from the Sabertooths, TJ Hunter
Now batting, the Stone-Age-Slugger, Cave Ruth!
Are  you sure you have the right club?
Make it count, Neanderthal - this is your last crack at making history!
Watch that Neanderthal guarding  third base. Acting meek as he trips you up and out.
Well, if it isn't Wonderboy with a club of his own.
Now, up at cudgel, Billy-Bob Cro-Magnon!
This guy throws like fire, scared yet?
If it's over the plate, just swing. Simple.
So, how do you pick up girls?
let's start with strike one
Looks like you still haven't invented fire.
Ty Bludgeon.  Good baseball name.
Today's my paleo cheat day.
Wanna see how well your helmet works?
Talks are going nowhere with management. Time to use some good old union tactics.
Sorry, only regulation equipment allowed.
Nowadays everyone wants a bigger bat.
We did our homework on you.
Grog, you know that's not regulation.
Is that bat even allowed?
Going old school huh ?
Bring in your corners -- this club is so heavy all I can do is bunt.
The extra innings last night catching up with you, Jim?  You’re looking a little Paleo.
I called for a mastodon but he shook me off.
No, more than just "retro", dude.
Maybe you should let your fingers do the talking.
It’s the heaviest one in my bat cave.
I notice you don’t wear batting gloves
Is that bat regulation?
well, i see the Neanderthals have a new lead off hitter this game. . .
Fans can be hard-- don't take the '...not a belly scratcher!' chants too personally.
Can you get around on his fastball with such a heavy bat?
Same rules, but we added a declared walk to speed things up.
That’s your problem.  You should have made a left turn at 2018.
So you must be the rookie they called up from the Cro-Magnon League.
Stand back!
All bat and no chattel.
Nice bat, your new uniform not so much.
I am going to request that the Umpire check that bat and see if it is corked!"
When you eat Fruity Pebbles, I guess you don't need a helmet. Right Flinstone?
Listen Pete, you just can't be here.
Will you wear that same throwback jersey when confirmed for a Supreme Court judgeship?
Hit the club last night?
I have one of the luckiest beards on the face of my friend Tony’s hubris.
Yea, that Paleo diet has done wonders for my batting average.
Hey, I thought you guys were extinct. Do you still bunt, move the runner over and hustle after every play?
They just brought me up from the Late Pleistocene last week...
i hate these new uniforms!
I know you just came from the clubhouse, but...
What league are you from?
you might not want to crowd that plate..'
Scram! You're in the wrong ball park kid.
Nothing but change ups and curve balls. These guys are looking for fire.
Where’s the helment?
The Battle of the Sexes wasn’t good enough for American audiences.
Today, you can only Club the ball...
There had better not be cork in that club.
Club house baseball. Pound the rock basketball
I know the owner disapproves of throwback uniforms, but he wasn't a fan of the beard when I first grew it either.
Unless you put on your batting helmet, you can't play.
I'll give you $50 to get a bite of that Velociraptor leg!
Shoulda' worn your cleats.
When they said the guy batting clean-up was a Neanderthal, I didn't think they meant it literally!
Me retire from Mammoth bashing, try Double-A baseball.
I'm here to slug anyone who's kneeling or squatting.
I'm tellin' ya, the speed-up rules mean ya gotta change!
If I hear another word about your Paleo diet, I'll get you plunked!
Listen, BAM BAM, I'm saying it's pine tar!
Me could never be catcher in uniform like this.
Is that the new Louisville Slugger?

The dinosaurs have there money on me, so don't mess it up.
The dress code on your team is so very different than the Yankees.  Just don't bend over too far!

You ready to get some fireballs?
You battin' for the Neanderthal or the Denisovan?
I hope you never try to steal home.
Have you ever played quartz ball before?
Don't worry, I've got this.
Your spray painting was dainty
Sir, we don't sell fire here. You can get that up in commissary.
They really stepped it up for Old Timers' Day this year
Classic shot or getting struck out?
You must be kidding. Is that pine tar on your jersey?
That ball took me thirty years to make.
Listen, pal. You’re not getting anything down the middle. You invented the wheelhouse.
Is the inning over yet?
The potential side effects of PEDs
Would you doublecheck your ticket? I think you're in my seat.
Thinking signaling a fast ball.
You: immigrant catcher. Me American. I hit ball into your country.
It doesn't matter how you got here, kid. You're in the big leagues now.
Cast-off circus Cave-Man, Erg, tries baseball, having failed miserably at golf.
You call it a club. I call it the Paleolithic Slugger.
So that's where that look was heading.
Can’t believe I have to put on cleats.
Does that club have cork in it?
The beard is fine; it’s the ‘no shoes and no helmet’ rule that has the home-base ump flummoxed.
Sorry, I don’t signal Rock.
Check the pine tar, pal
My exit velocity was clocked at 108 mph at 43 degrees.
No, it's not throwback Thursday.
When hockey season start
Can the wisecracks 'catch', I'm your union rep!
I don't care if it's a Neolithic Slugger. That's not a regulation bat.
Welcome to the show - I heard you really clobbered the ball down in Bedrock.
They've taken the uniforms pretty far this year.
Label goes up, buddy!
You must be from the new dugout.
Every batter MUST wear a helmet!
"This is baseball, not baseline."
I know it's been a long road to The Show, but experience counts in this league.
Wow. I knew the beard was "back" but...that's a bit much.
speak softly, but hit the ball, not the other team

speaking softly is OK, hitting home runs is better
No, bring a club. This season doesn’t have too many players.
"Dude!  Too many mammoth-burgers."
Now batting, Shoeless Joe Jackson—back from the grave.
Maybe you are, but I have to tell you I still don't like the designated hitter rule.
Are you the pinch hitter?
You're in the wrong stadium. Try the Tigers.
The team owner's solution to correct the politically incorrect team name of The Toronto Knuckle Draggers.
Yes, the dugout is sort of like a cave.
New ball club?
Thanks for not wearing spikes!
Gee, and I thought our throwback uniforms were bad.
The Ump can't see your knees
No, Trog, don't strike ME!
I’m telling you, this next hit will be prehistoric!
Finally made it to the live ball era?
Hey Bob, I'm giving this Paleo diet one more week.
When the Mets go back to the basics...
Call it right down the middle and I promise not to eat you.
Triple A Neanderthal League?
Our own mother told me, Dell, that you would chatter about how I dressed and my bad swing.
No one uses hickory anymore.
Nice outfit!
What? I’m trying the paleo diet...
Our new uniforms are woolly mammoth. They're supposed to breathe better.
These Minor League promotional nights are getting out of control
I haven't practiced in a while.
Keep on eye out for Flinstone; that guy's gonna be a star!
The Paleolithic League? Never heard of it.
I'm on the Keto Diet.
Hey, caveman, you never heard of the appearance policy?
Better watch out, Thog.  Our pitcher has a helluva curve rock.
They should've called this game back in the Dark Ages.
After last night, we couldn't find any willing to call a ball against you.
Didn't you play for the Rockies?
"Just how long have you been with the Club?
Pro Magnum Man
You guys don’t have a clean up man?
I don't get it. Your 'Green Monster' doesn't even have any teeth?"
I am not a member of a baseball club.  I swing a club.
Personally, I feel your attempt to intimidate the pitcher is silly.
Swing hard.  Just in case you hit it.
It’s called BASEBALL not stone ball...
Aren't you a bit too old for this game?
How 'bout we give you something fancy?
A Drumstick is not allowed at the Batter's Box, Sorry ?
You got something against our club?
The League said we can only hit baseballs on Ladies2C%22href%22:%22https://account.newyorker.com/?retURL
There ain't no cavemen in baseball!
Now batting from the Stone ERA...
More like Neander couldn't hit the side of a barn,
No batta, no batta!
It’s still gonna hurt when I hit you! Ugh
Sir, that's EXACTLY how I'd answer another snide remark about my bat! Or do I need to draw you a picture?
Sorry, they require a head protector now.
That's part of the new rules to speed up the game.
Remember what we taught you, this is where "Hit and run," is good.
You're the first player I've ever seen who's moved UP to the Bush League
What club you with again?
I don't care what you think! I love the throwback uniforms!
No wonder this job was open.
After all these years I am finally home
So, I’m on day 3 of going Paleo
Please don't beat us.
If you can hit a homer with that thing,you'll make history.
This where I go to kill ump?
It's usually the pitcher that throw's a curve ball.
That club is no match for our flame-thrower.
Can I get your cave drawing after the game?
Rookie?  Who you calling a rookie?

Global warming has changed the game as unfrozen caveman comes to the plate.
"With my one strike you will be out!"
Last night’s hit-by-pitch really knocked Jeff back to the Stone Age.
What’s the deal with these uniforms?
I bet you can't even remember your first old timers game.
See, this is what happens when you don't have a designated hitter.
When Spielberg bought this field, he should not have changed the name to Jurassic Park.
I know, Pete Rose, most hits ever.
My cave mates say that you're holding try outs.
That dress is going to make it hard to slide.
Nothing like the Flintstones-Yankees game.
They tied our salary to number of followers: #CrushedRetroDay, you know what I’m sayin’ dude?
You’re the “next big thing”?

Minor leagues. Troglodyte Division.
Steroid Era?  No, Prehistoric Era
Hey dude, those clothes are inappropriate for going clubbing.
Bro'! Just because you're going old school with the bat doesn't mean you have to dress the part.
So we meet again
'
How many 'so we meet again's have you gotten at this point?
Watch out dude, I'm fresh from the man-cave with a brand new dino bat to swing.
Ball good... hit bad.
Og hate low-brow pitches.
Yes, you could clobber me but you'd  get thrown out of the game, OR you can hit the small ball really hard, many, many times, and receive seven figure endorsements.
Grok swing. Grok miss. Swing, miss. Swing, miss. Strikeout this Homo neanderthalensis.

Those time-traveling talent scouts weren't kidding when they said your technique was primitive.
What do you think I'm overcompensating for?
You must be the franchise player.
No. There will be a ball. You hit the ball.
Watch out -- he's throwing fire today!
It's old technology; but it works!
'Throwback day' today?"
No!  Repeat after me:  "Head-bonk, no!  Quaaludes, no!"  Today, it's sensitivity and understanding.  And try a little deodorant, too.
What do you MEAN the club's, not "regulation"?
Okay! Punt and gather! Punt and gather!
Stick,, ball,,but pit not tar
It's simple. You hit the ball, run counterclockwise -- heck! Just mash it!
Dude, analog is dead again.
I'm not insured. I can't afford to come out without protection.
Just make sure that dress stays down when you swing!
I am pinch hitting for Bryce
Hey, batter, batter.
If he's the leadoff hitter, I can't even imagine what the cleanup man looks like.
I hit for the mammoth crowd straight out of the all park every time.
You looked better in your Yankees uniform.
Blue Socks vs Sapien Sapians
The singles bar is down the street.
Can you tell me where the club house is?
Maybe slide headfirst into home this time?
Are you new to the majors?
Anything to break out of a slump, huh?
You're not going to throw off the analytics with this old school crap!
Talk about toxic masculinity...
It's made of mammoth. Carved it myself.
Remember, you don't drag a woman by her hair when you run the bases.
Don't worry, it's not aluminum
Have you ever heard of deodorant?
Who schedules the World Series on Halloween?
Excuse me, did you notice a triceratops run by just now?
You're taking the retro uniform look a little too far!
If I miss that mammoth, you're going to need a bigger mitt.
So your that guy that wants to make baseball great again?
I was just called up from the homo erectus league. I hope I can adjust to your bigger strike zone.
The scouting report says you’re straight outta the dead-ball era.
Hey, O'l timer.
Do you have any paleo options?
You're in the wrong park. He doesn't throw meatballs.
No, the game is not being livestreamed.
Play to win.
Just got here from the minors - couldn't find a uniform that fit ........
Hey buddy you're in the majors now, the least you can do is shave, a shower wouldn't hurt either.

You can't slug with a club.
You’re taking this paleo diet a little too far.
This is going in the stands, chump
You'll make a fine mate.
You been doing the Paleo?
when you say "you'll never club the ball" whatsa a ball?
They kept you in the minors a long time.
My wife sent me to get me out of the cave!
I'm on the farm team.
Gonna swing this club like I swing my dick!
It's my baseball club...
You must be that new kid up from the Cro-Magnon farm team.
[your mother]
And now batting for the New York Mets, Ugh!
Hey mac, this ain't The Flintstones.
You no worry, Steroids not Paleo
Just keep your eye on the ball.
You have to wear a helmet if you want to bat
Still with the same old ball club,I see.
Nice Retro! But your helmet strikes out.
Lost the contract negotiations, didn't you?
This time they've really gone too far with Turn Back the Clock.
You hit the ball and then drop the club.
What you see is not what's happening!
It's regulation size in my home league.
Sorry, sir, this isn't what we meant when we advertised Bat Day.
No, the clubhouse is behind you.
I bet you can’t remember the last game we played together!
These theme nights are getting extreme.
You take Halloween way too seriously, Jeremy.
No spiked slides, corked clubs, or Flintstones' chewable steroids.
Got a problem?  I’m the new pitch hitter!
Looks like mother nature threw someone a curveball.
The sleaveless retro uniform enhances my launch angle.
Love your vintage uniform.
Wanna see a picture of your armadillo?
You worry about the pitches and I'll worry about the pictograph
Well, at least I won't have to listen to them accuse me of wearing the 'tools of ignorance' anymore.
You'll need a regulation bat.
You said you'd love me if I did
What do think of our logo?
Hey, I know you.  I watched you play in the 2003 Canadian Baseball League.
Does it count if I avoid getting hit by what the guy over there is getting ready to throw at me?
When’d you guys get a new offensive coordinator?
Doubled down on the steroids?
Two more curveballs and you're out
Does the saying "Knock it out of the park" mean anything to you?
You were given 'time'  How many times!?
Good grief, it's the bat from Hell. Walk him!
I guess this is man's big-inning.
scam!  you may be a slugger, but your bat isn't a Louisville slugger!
Are you calling a tight strike zone?
Krall Gerk at club!
Why don't you just take your base?
I'm afraid we have a dress code, sir.
You guys take 'Turn Back the Clock Night' to a new level.
It's not like with the wild things.
You get three chance here.
No. Me hit you. Not ball.
My bat dates to BC and the Stone Age!
Can you direct me to the concession stands?
Face it - you're an anachronism.
Watch out for the high heat.
Let me guess...You also heard a rumor that our Cubs were easy to beat.
I think you'll have trouble with all the tar.
Step aside, Padre.
A bat out of hell?  Is that what you are afraid of?
Strike three. You out.
I'm here to skip some stones.
Now batting: baseball's fan demographic.
What's that...a Lucyville Slugger?
Looking good, been doing that paleo diet?
You'll be alright bub. Raptors play a different sport altogether.
I take it you're the designated hitter?
I've heard of throwback uniforms, but this is ridiculous!
Please explain why your head not part of strike zone.
No Sir, you are in the wrong MET
I don't think your bat meets MLB regulations.
I'm pretty sure the League requires shoes.
The directions on the cave wall?
I'll never be able to run home.
Coach, you should be talking to the guy on the mound, I'm just catching them. Or trying...
It's looking to be a prehistoric night
Rumor has it the ump has a small strike zone.
Watch out for the Neanderball
It seems like ages since it’s been your turn at bat!
That’s some ball club
Yep.  Bought out by 20th Century BC Fox, so I’m the new old batter.
“No Spike’s my name, clubbin’s my game.”
How else will I make it to Cooperstown?
What cause does your uniform support?
You guys are taking 'throw back' jersey night a bit far don't ya think? 
Like reeeeaaaal far!
Are they pitching meatballs?
Is this your first time playing the game?
You got any naked pictures of your brontosaurus?  Want to see some?
Oso Blanco? Really?
I don't care if our dugout is nicer than your dugout.
Trade you my bat for your face guard!
Watch yourself. This pitcher is brutal!
I'm an "originator" okay pal?
Our next game is at Giants Stadium..
That halloween costume is starting to get old.
You guys must have an awesome clubhouse!
Let me guess caveman, your name is Casey...
What mean 'bat not regulation?'
Korg like smash home run.
Up from the Minors?
It's what home WILL look like.
Go back to the dugout; you forgot your cleats again.
Someone said you needed a pinch-hitter.
No, but I eat pine tar for breakfast. Why would I rub some on my club?
You must be just up from the minors.
This game is out of your league.
What d’ya mean you’re not in the players union?
That’s the way the Ump  called it,”Two strikes, no balls”
Betcha a T Rex thigh bone they told you to take two and hit to right.
Are we having fun?
Apparently you’re unaware our paraphernalia has advanced.
I'll make sure he doesn't throw at your head.
Coach said recruiting was tough this year--your from a farm team?
Sorry, your game is at 1 am.
These old-timer uniforms are murder.
Wow ! Your team took old school uniform day, and ran with it.
If it's a good hit, then you can finally go home!
I want to bring the game back to its basic element.'
I get it, fashion is cyclical but Silence of the Lambs is so 90's"
Don't step back!
I missed the throwback uniforms email...You guys really go that far back?
You guys sure are serious about throwback jersey day.
I'm the original splendid splinter.

Aluminum ?   It's  a wooden, 32 ounce, Louisville Slugger that I carved myself .
I want a pitcher, not a glass of water.
Uh, you're new to this game if I'm guessing correctly.
If he strikes me out, I'll beat you to a pulp!
Let's go, Clubbies
That's enough, trade me back to the National League.
Looks like you lost a few.”

“Thanks, been trying that me diet everyone raves about.”
Judge? Me not
Yankees - no I play for the CLUBS
You hunter and me gatherer.
Don't expect any gathering errors.
What's a Louisville slugger?
Ring Lardner would have loved you.
Prehistoric Batter UP ?
Some things never change.
Yeah...this is one long inning all right.
Let me get this right. I kill it
You won't be able to hit it. It's not a rock.
I already know the answer, but I still have to ask--is that a regulation bat?
Cro-Mag at the bat.
So, where did they call you up from?
Are you the blue wave?
Batter up and so's the turf.
He’s gonna walk you to pitch to the Missing Link
Pitching outside - that bothers you?
The modern game has no room for people like you.
Nobody brought any Cro-Magnon helmets?
Well, you’re the one who called for a curveball.
Sorry Gary, you're still not my type.
I bet cave-chicks dig the long ball too", huh
Hey Og, you know why they call beard-level inside fastballs high heat?  Get ready to discover fire next pitch."
They cheer loudest when you swing and miss the ball."
Just don't throw the bat, pal!
Babe Ugg. Neandertal. Me hit ball.
If you ask me, we went too far with the throwback jerseys this year.
Ducks on pond? Me eat well tonight.
No matter how many times they yell it, I still don't feel 'safe'.
What  club  are  you  with ?
I heard this was the place for competitive clubbing & putrified meat. 
Who do I see about that?
Is that the knee you’re taking, or are you just happy to see me?
Can I play too?
Strikes are good, let me show you.
Are you absolutely certain you're in the right millenium?
You're so old, you live in cave!
The wife hunt is in the next stadium
And then I do what?
Look, it's not the uniform. I just don't think your bat meets league specifications.
Are you sure he remembers not to knock the catcher out this time?
You guys may have the public on your side,but its just another day at the office for me …
Can you give me some insurance you are not going to have a big back swing?
I heard they were giving you guys a TV show too. What happened there?
I know we need to find revenue sources where we can Mickey, but this Geico thing is a little over the top.
Eyes on the ball!
No, there is no illegal Triceratops Residue on the club; it's in my beard!
Remember, these are just pads; the league is going to penalize you if you make turtle soup out of one more catcher.
Who you callin’ a Leftie, huh?
Are you Roger Angell's son?
I hear there is some great new over the counter drug for those plantars warts.
I thought BYOB meant bring your own bat.
Our pitcher has something you’ve never seen before....a fireball.
I told you that side effects included Shrinking of the testicles, Impotence and Stunted evolution!
So. Will the sports writers again dub your flurry of homers and hits today  yet another 'Oog-gasm'?
Back Up!
Per the scouting report, you can’t bunt, but can hunt.
I am not purposefully calling any pitches that might hit you.
I refuse to call it 'Cave Plate'.
Glad you're a part of our ball club, Garf.
You just up from the bush leagues?
Your team is taking this whole “throwback” thing a little too far, aren’t they?
I understand they brought you up from Class A Cave City
Well, it's clear from down here that you're already playing small ball.
Just because you're the oldest player in the league; you can't use a prehistoric bat"
Read all about it!  Braves Cave on Mascot!
I know it's Oldtimers Day but how many years did you play?
Does the name “Abner Doubleday” mean anything to you?
Stand in box, and man will throw dinosaur egg at you"
Ugg! Digging the new uniform!
I can teach you the very base of baseball!
Forgetaboutit - Go back to the fantasy league where you belong.
Paleo diet...now paleo baseball?
You missed it.  Old Timers Game was yesterday.
Last batter break rock.
You hit the ball - not my head!
They’re just like us
It’s 2018!  You must have overslept!
That’s it. I’m done with Throwback Nights.
I'm a little bit rusty.
Yeah, social media is a bitch...
I could really use a safe space right now.
This Neanderthal's gonna blow you away.
Be careful of your fingers when I bludgeon.
No, no caveman... you’re ON a club.

Ball? do I bash the catch or the umpire?
So, you finally made it to the Show!
No, this isn't a singles club
So you just moved up from the Paleo League?
You earn RBIs, not ribs.
Hey! That's not a regulation bat!  It may be OK for cricket, but not here"
Nice. You've taken the beard trend to its logical conclusion.
You look like the designated hitter. Could you bunt this time round please?
You know 2 fingers used to mean a curveball.
Your bat's too big
If I call a strike, and you drop the billy club, will you promise to bring back Unions?
Team Geico really needs a win today, so just hit it out of the park.
Be kind.
No evolution here.”
Remember, you are supposed to hit the ball.
Look, you Neanderthal, that is not a bat !
If you're not homo sapien, why do they let you play?
Yeah the ball’s on fire. We just invented it.
I see the Designated Homo sapien has arrived.
I just got called up from the Pro-Magnon League.
(O.S.) The ball, Jeff! Aim for the ball!
Sorry. You need to wait for the ref. He calls the balls and strikes.
I will let you use my bat. You are a catcher though, aren’t you?
How’re the wife and kids?
They're not yelling at you, I swear
You can’t hear a word he says but is batting average has gone way up since he started using the Roosevelt Method.
Look, even if it helps to see the ball as a cave woman's head, keep it to yourself.
My pitcher's a real fireballer.  Oh, do you know what that means?
“ Now  THAT’S  a throw -back  uniform! “
Look...first take a shower...dude...second...regulation bat...third dude...regulation clothes...and shoes dude...got it...now go!...
I'm your worst nightmare, buddy. You shouldn't have swatted that fly.
Yeah, yeah—next you're going to tell you just came out of the bat-cave.
The scouting report says you won’t last in this league if you can’t evolve your frontal lobe.
Hey, you've been around this league a long time.
Yall are taking this throwback thing too far.
You must be their new DH*.


*Designated Hitter
I know we're suppose to wear retro jerseys for this game, but you look ridiculous.
Paleolithic dudes have never seen a FORKball!
As an independent thinker, I don't believe in uniformity.
I heard you were drafted for your slugging percentage.
Baaaaatttter up!
Where's your ball cap, Slugger?
Sorry. I haven't seen her.
It‘s called paleo-play.
Neanderthal growth hormone?
I beg your pardon sir, but I believe you that you’ve forgotten a helmet.
That bat is way out of  a bat from the stone age - Strike one, two and three!  Step away from the game.
So, you're the one they call "the Natural"?

He's gonna throw another slider -- don't freeze up this time.

Bam Bam Bednarski -- up for another cup of java, man?


Niall Brennan, Cross River, NY
Helmet! You said? That’s an interesting headgear
They're really going too far with these retro uniforms.
I betcha can't make it to first base.
I SAID, 'I SURELY WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE YOU IN THIS ROTATION!'... you seen the ump?
Cro-Magnon No Sox Throwback Uniform Day?
Digging the new uniform.
I'm not a fan of Old-Timers' Games.
I'm pretty sure that's not a regulation bat.
Hey man, there is a new rule prohibiting performance enhancing bats -PEDs!
Heads up for the chin music
Steroids? I don't use steroids.
I’m your designated Piltdown Man hitter.
That's not what I meant by "bring your ball club."
There isn't a lightening bolt on that thing, is there?
They’re taking those throwback uniforms to the limit!
Two fingers means I'm going to runaway.
And they said that Neander Bhal was extinct.
I just wanted to say what am honor it is to catch against THE Solomon Wohlgelernter.
Me hit ball far watch!
We're done with these primitive games.
I understand you picked to help keep your team in the hunt.
You've got the best throwbacks in the league.
What's all that pitter-patter going on between  your legs?
The ump just called you a "neanderthal."
We're taking this paleo thing to the next level.
No, this ain't whack-a-mole but you look like a good fit."

In the heat of the game, five seconds feels like an eternity.
Can’t do it no matter what TR said
Bush league my ass! Where did they find you?
Was your signing bonus in pelts?
Calm down.  We are not vegan.  Hotdogs with mustard are thataway.
Ever since you were traded away, we've experienced what they call "The Curse of the Bam-Bam-bino."
Why are you wearing so many clothes?
I think I’m cricket person not baseball.
I don’t think that bat is regulation
Something tells me you never settle for the first weapon out of the rack.
It's time to shave.
guess there is no cork in your bat since aluminum has not been invented yet
You're the " clean up " hitter?
The designated hitter rule has really extended my career.
Your team doesn't stand a chance. I invented this game.
Lets blow this popstand, I know a club.
homie, I may or may have not soiled myself.
I’m pintch hitter
The wife said I really needed to get out more.
You get'em special?
I call it my “Persuader”
I'm still not fully on board with the idea of a Designated Hunter."
So you’re the new prospect...Summers Pastime?
Contestant on Let's Make a Deal?
Ogg not leftie.  He switch-hitter.
I'm fluent in grunt-speak, and you're outta here if you insult me again.
No, you're an unevolved relic of the past.
You'd best remove your armor if you want to play cavemen.
You don't use spikes?
See you after the game, at the clubhouse.
I thought Retro Uniform Night was NEXT Saturday.
I tried paleo soccer, but it was way too hard on my toes.
No wonder you never got a shoe contract.
You must be the pinch hitter from the National Club Baseball Association?
You didn’t wanna use that other bat?
Yeah, no peanuts or Cracker Jacks, but I’m on track to fit back in uniform by the postseason.
Where's your regulation helmet?
Who caved and let you play in a dress?
Helmet? Helmet? You'll have met hell when I am done with you.
It's not so easy, Caveman!
Back in my day, we didn't get helmets.
Hey Fred, Rubber Arm Rubble has enough problems out there without you cheating.
Nope, sorry but you're not up for another several thousand years
We require that you use a regular baseball bat. Why?  Because that club of yours would knock it not just out of the park but out of the city!
You’re playing the original version?
Piltdown Man? You’ll have to hit from the other side of the plate.
The fingers are ONLY for the pitcher!
Yes, Joe, and Grog is one of the fastest players we've seen in years.
I bet you didn’t know the ‘pinch’ in pinch hitter is all about the opposable thumbs.
You've already caved under the pressure.
I'm going to guess you're a 1-tool player.
Sorry, I'm already married.
Yes, I know where the bathroom is.  Just try and hit the ball.
BIG man, BIG club, little yellow puddle on home plate.
This bat may look prehistoric but your record for rbi's predates the wheel.
Gork no cork club.
The bat is pine. The tar is on my feet.
They don't wear batting gloves where I come from.
Step away from my home!
Somebody say ‘meatball’?
Christ, Kevin, you're really taking that Paleo diet seriously.
You are not in regulation uniform to play
We must be related. I’m number 2 as well...
And did you notice that baby was crying through half of the game and I didn't get angry? Not once. Did you notice that? I didn't get angry once because I didn't want to insult the parents for not taking the kid out of the room!
I'm a batavism.
Please  just one more chance, Coach.
Did you go Paleo?
It's going to come in pretty fast but don't cave.
Don’t start me with,’Who’s on first...who’s on second...’
Is this the varsity team??  I was more interested in the club sport.
Remember, you have to hit the ball. Not me.
I thought all troglodytes were lefties.
I was told I could play Neanderball
We hit from close range. We don't really hit from far.
It’s not time yet.
You'll have a better crack at it if you open your eyes.  Besides, the pitcher's E.R.A. is paleolithic.
Where's the beef?
Gosh - didn't know you'd come out of retirement Mr Damon?
I didn't know the Yankees had relaxed their dress code.
Remember - I am NOT a reptile!
You’re up, Comrade.
That's not a regulation size bat, and there's too much tar on it.
Spoiler alert.  I’m their switch-hitter.
Old school, my dude.  Respect.
How BIG is the Ball? How FAST does he throw it?
How long have you been in the on deck circle
I've been perfecting my launch angle
I thought you played for the Red Socks.
I've been sent for the pitcher.
Go back to your cave and get a batting helmet
Would I be out of Line if I  called you the babe?
New to the league?
Don't even THINK of asking for a video replay.
You’re in my wheelhouse
Sorry neathdrethal......pitchers only hit in the National league..
Old Timers Day is next week!
Time-out's gotta hurt.
That the same as the "kilt" thing?
Hey buddy, it can't be more than 2.61 inches in diameter.
I get endless strikes.
I think there’s a misunderstanding; the TEAM is called a baseball club.
OK , bat cave!  But is it ABA approved?
That's about the biggest Louisville Slugger I have ever seen...
Hay, This isn't club ball.
Gotta love vintage uniform day.
You have Yabba and Dabba down but you need to work on Doo.
Hey Krog, I heard ya went clubbing last night.  Ha! 
Okay, strike that....
What, your cave doesn't have bats?
Millennials are taking this retro thing too far
Hey rookie, which cave did they drag you out of?
Since you left the Yankees you really haven't stuck with the grooming policy, huh?
Don’t even think about swinging that club, just run the bases.
You're the Designated Hitter. The American League made that a position since you played last time.
No monkeying around here.
I thought the Red Sox traded you?
You're in trouble for two reasons. One, this pitcher throws heat. Two, you don't know what that means.
Watch the attitude, buddy; the umpire has a spear.
Ah, Mr. Gattis--just as I thought.
The old-timers game was yesterday
I'll show you my equipment of you'll show you mine!!
Wow.  I guess the sport is really devolving.
So you're telling me you've never roided up before?
Retro uniforms, eh?
So you’re the guy that came up with the miner’s, huh?
I would argue my wife would want you to club the base
Whoa.  You need to do a deodorant commercial Cro-Man
They told me it was a baseball club
And do you also have Fan Caves?
Hello Mr. Roosevelt.
Slugfest! ha, take a good look at the pitcher
With or without the bones?
Hey, slugger, you think you can clear the bases with that thigh bone
Is this your first Old Timers game?
I hope you didn’t get the “hit and run” sign!
Love the new uniform but the bat's not regulation.
The coach told me to hit a scary home run
Give me fastballs or I give you death.
Didn’t you get the memo about the new bat size requirement?
Uh, can someone explain the meaning of “ball club” to Harald the Smiter here?
Yeah, I've been thinking of switching to the Paleo diet, too.
All I did was to ask them to send me a reliable bat holder with a good bat, not past!
No cleats, again?
Betchya never faced a fireballer before.
Have you heard if it's going to be a soft or hard Brexit?
Hey pal, you can't HIT the ball unless you WATCH the ball!  Capische, stone brain?!
Well, if it isn't Mr. Saber-toothed tigermetrics!
Get rid of the sregosaurus. Then you can take some swings.
Please know that if they expand the batter's box to accommodate your size you'll find my head at the point of your swing.
I think they meant a different clubhouse.
Is that a club bat?
I'm guessing you didn't sign a contract."
If you remember correctly I am the one who suggested they scout at the Lascaux caves.
May I suggest a bat with more predictable outcomes?
My wife's glad to hear you ate bread.
Chicks also dig the bunt.
I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess you play left field.
Gad, you guys must of partied more then we did.
I don't care if you club it or hit it. Just swing at the ball when it comes your way!
'Let's not strike each other out'
For a clean-up hitter, you certainly don't smell the part.
You bat .225. Me bat .330
No bat flipping or we'll all end up in outer space.
Are you sure you're up to bat?
HEY BADDER. Hey bagger...ssssswing batter.
Me want curveball low and outside.
Maybe a ball in the Paleolithic age but at Citi Field it's a strike.
Remember, this time it's the ball and not my head.
I ‘KL choke up on the bat and throw it the pitcher.
I was Casey's Great-Great Grandfather.
Is that a regulation bat?
Watch the spikes, slugger.
Watch out! This guy’s got a wicked curve rock.
Wanna see what a real bat can do?
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
No batter! No batter! He's a Neanderthal! No batter!
Our beards were the inspiration for the retro uniforms.
Here comes the deuce. And when you speak of me, speak well.
Stonies?
Yes, I said, "No balls and two strikes."
How’s the paleo diet going?
Unfortunately for catcher Fred, this Neanderthal is a Trump supporter and Fred’s Trump shaming hit new lows. Furthermore, Fred’s face mask is no protection against a solid hit to the top of his head.
Spent my whole minor league salary on this robe.
Wait, tell me again, what’s a hit?
Excellent! I see you brought your own bat.  Now for shoes...I think we have a spare pare in the dugout that will fit perfectly.
So try smash flying rock into animal called mascot?
Yeah, I waived my no trade clause when the team changed their uniforms.
He man, even in the Cave Man league we would never defecate on home plate.
Half amardilo half zebra. Must taste awful!
With her you'll never get to 1st base.
His fast ball comes in low.
WITH MY STONE BAT I CAN PLAY BETTER GAME
Bedrock vs Boston. “Man there ain’t no way that bat’s regulation.”
You can't play with prehistoric pine tar on your bat.
MLB regulations, man.
This isn't stick baseball.  You'll need to get a bat.
Yummm baby Stegosouras.
How do you think the Cubs finally won the World Series in 2016?
We don't club oranges, we just pick 'em.
This guy's really going to lower the ERA.
Yeah, that’s not regulation
Gee, we haven't played your team since ages ago.
Well, look who's just come up from Lascaux.
Good luck with a “home run”!
They changed the intentional walk rule? What about intentional clubbing?
Which Hemsworth are you?
Is that back regulation size?
No, you idiot, don't hit my head.  Wait for a white ball to come.
I guess you don't need pine tar for that bat.
You gonna wanna back up. I trained swingin' wide bustin' skulls.
Wrong ball club, pal.
When I start swingin', yer gonna need a lot more protection.
Don't forget your helmet.
The beard works but I'm afraid the bat isn't regulation...
Why is home-plate backwards??  Do you want to make things harder for the pitcher??
Aren't you taking "old school" a bit far?
You corking with amber?
Let me guess, the Teen Angel's are batting 2, 3 and 4?
You let the dog play.
Never mind the club... what's your WAR?
The Yankees wouldn252F%252Fwww.newyorker.com%252Fcartoons%252Fcontest%2523thisweek%253Freload%253Dtrue%22}
Hey, I don't care if you're the president's favorite team, you still get only three strikes.
Hey, that's not a regulation bat, buddy!
You'll never be able to catch up with this guys cave ball.
Cave Ball
They make us wear retro uniforms just to sell more merchandise.
I knew extending the season to October 31 would be a problem.
What do you mean what is a bunt?
Baseball, I don't need your stinking ball!!
Yabba dabba doo, how’s the bibs with Aaron Boone?
Sorry, not a plate you can eat off of.
No, I don't think the new uniforms are 'cultural appropriation.' Batter up!
The bat could put out a few windows across the street, but wouldn’t count in the scoreboard
Actually... most players have beards, you’ll blend right in.
No, it wasn't a slider.
Nice to see you Thor.  You’re the only one from the class of 500 BC to make it back to the reunion game.
Fancy a cave run?
You say the pitcher has an ERA of 2.75? He looks at least Neolithic to me.
You no want see me get hit by pitch.
Hey Bamm Bamm,Remember me? Mr Flintstone was our Little League coach ages ago.
In the major league, underwear is not optional.
You swing bat. You miss ball. Good.
Dawn of the DH ( desigmnated itter )
No, Snerg, you’re supposed to hit the banner, not the pitcher !
Your pitcher's having an off day, eh?
The signal means, don't cave under pressure.
You might want to bunt
Back off.  When I swing this, ANYTHING can happen.
Is he still throwing the spitball?_OR_If he brushes me back, I'm using this club.
Try to hit the ball with the club when the man out there throws it to me.
Kronk designated hitter.
Hey slugger, you know how to punt?
He is a throw back to the time when you just hit the catcher.
Throwback uniform night really brings out the crowds.
You're going to need that big bat. Trump is on the mound today and he throws a wicked screwball.
Sorry, not regulation, back to the clubhouse.
You guys are taking throwback uniforms too far.
Hit me in the knees so I can get out of this position
I won't knock your head into the bleachers if you signal a pitch down the middle
Baseballs are too small, we've got a whole evolution to blow out of existence
Cleats? What are those?
We used to wear those uniforms back in the day. Not so good in this heat.
Yes, we can tell a home from a plate, you duplex-dwelling dunce.
That's as close as you get for kneeling, Bud !
The injury bug has REALLY hit the METS this season. They have dug deep into the farm system for their next batter.
Are the umpires on strike, or is it just me?
This wouldn't be a boy of summer Punch and Judy hitter?
I swear, "fireball" is just a name. There's no actual fire involved.
Has anyone every mentioned to you how softly you walk?
Are you in the strike zone?
I think you have too much La Brea Tar on your bat.
No, you will not hit it out of the cave. You will hit a bat. That is why they call it batting.
Is that bat quartzed?
I'd really appreciated it if you'd stop using the C word.
Full count. That means ‘| | |’ and ‘| |’.
I got it in the club house. What's it to you?
Go for it, don't cave in.
If the clubhouse rumors are for real, Johnny, and Cashman buys your contract from the Red Sox, you're gonna have to clean that up.
Trust me, it's okay. Just hit and run.
You say the bat's regulatio
You did it. You took this beard thing to it’s natural conclusion.
. . . and if I refuse?
laugh all you want, but  it 's  jacked up my DRA higher than your  guy's BB9/W-IP, and it's still higher than my own WOBA!
You must hate throwback uniform nights.
Throwback Thursday at Fenway Park
Bam Bam go pow pow on helmet
Just give it some time and "Cave"man will be replaced by "Breg"man!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A BALL IS?
I heard going Paleo helps your game, but don’t you miss the carbs?
How’s a bad time, but ... matches.
Who's your agent?
I like your new uniforms
I admire your pitch selection, it comes so naturally.
Bunting again?
Told you that wasn't your Clubhouse, right?
Well strike me down! Gives a whole new meaning to Extra Hitter! Normally sent from dugout not nearest cave!!
I draw the line at velociraptors.
So you're the guy who's evolving the game?
Let's trade places.
Of course back then we didn't call it "Tommy John surgery" ... we called it "having your arm eaten by a dinosaur."
Just to clear the air, I don't believe any of those rumors you've used steroids.
You know we play hardball here, don't you?
This has nothing to do with lunch.
Paleo diet, schmaleo diet-you still can’t hit a curve.
I homered and beat a wooly mammoth with this bat.
I guess PED's now stands for prehistoric enhancing drugs.
I thought it only felt like time went backwards when I watched baseball.
Your new manager is really old school.
Give it up, you're never going to come back from this far behind.
Been stuck in the dug-out a long time?
Out of the park will take on a whole new meaning."
 Janice Resnick, Rochester, N
Pangea? Never heard of it. That a Single-A club?
This is not vavoom ball. This is baseball.
Boog Powell
Welcome to the show kid, I heard you hit 620 last season with the Neanderthals Triple-A team!
Sorry  Shoeless, your oversized Louisville Slugger just won't run with us
The reliever's been icing his shoulder 20,000 years.
You’re really killing it with the throwback uniform.

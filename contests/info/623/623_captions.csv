You better hope that was rain I just felt."
It's a park. He's on a leash. What's it to you?
Okay, but if he starts sniffing their tails he has to leave.
Have you tried saying, "Down, boy"?
He's a beagle, but he claims the "b" is silent.
Sir, are you suggesting that someone else's kite pooped on the lawn?
Skye terrier or Airedale?
Can I borrow that?  I’ve got to get a cat out of a tree.
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
Sir, did you leave a kite at the dog park by any chance?
Sticking his head out the car window just doesn't do the trick for him anymore.
But my dog IS on a leash
He's a bird dog.
Sorry, sir, dog days are in August
No no, it’s let sleeping dogs LIE
Any chance you can do that with a pig?  My wife would have to let me get a motorcycle if you could.
Do you realize your kite's in the car with the window cracked open?
No, dogs are welcome. But we do enforce the laws of physics.
The sign only said, “No dogs on grass.”
Sir, all dogs go to heaven, it's time to let go.
I can't even get mine to sit!
Gravity isn't just a theory in this town, sir. It's the law.
He's still learning "down."
The leash law isn't the problem. I'm worried about how good a catch you are with that little plastic bag.
This is a New Yorker cartoon, Sir, not a Far Side.
The second he starts marking his territory you're outta here.
"We're getting complaints from people with absolutely no imagination."
C'mon man, it's a therapy kite.
They said he's too high-strung for the dog park.
Sir, I don't make the laws of gravity, I just enforce them.
In addition to violating the leash law, sir, 
you’re also in violation of Newton’s first, second and third laws of motion.
Everyone always says 'sit.'  No one ever thinks to say 'fly.'
I hope that you walked him first?
We’re going to need you to pick up after your kite.
LIMERICK: There once was a dog name of Spot....Got a hold of a whole lotta pot...It got him so high...He thought he could fly...And now, I can't get him to stop.
I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you’re going to have to put him down.
You need to clean up after your kite.
Sir, when I said your dog couldn't set foot in this park again...
Honestly, this is more believable than the recent election...
Sorry sir, support kites are not permitted in this park
Yes, sir. I'm quite sure it's not just a passing sprinkle.
I don't care how he identifies, sir.
I know what you’re thinking, Officer.  Why is this guy wearing a jacket in July?
For the record, we don't allow kites in the dog park either.
Sir, just because it has a tail, doesn’t make it a kite...
Your dog is high as a kite.
I don't think you understand the gravity of this situation.
We're doing K-9 training over there, and I believe your little fella may have gotten into the drug sniffing kit.
If I let one person violate the laws of physics, soon everyone will.
Does he know DOWN?
Unless this is Thanksgiving and your name’s Macy, you’re coming with me.
Dog catcher? No. I'm from the FAA.
Can he do any tricks?
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to go fly a kite.
His addiction started when we let him stick his head out of the car window.
I don't care if it is an emotional support kite, it's not allowed here.
No problem. He's an Airedale.
Is he an Airedale or a Skye Terrier?
That'd better be rain I'm feeling.
No,sir,the saying is let sleeping dogs lie.
It's the damnedest thing. He always used to chase the helium truck and then one day he caught it.
I told you last time.  Curb your dog.
I thought I would let sleeping dogs fly.
Glad to see you have him on a leash today.
The man in the open convertible would like to have a word with you.
Be sure to clean up after your kite.
Land Rover!
Investigating reports of a dog chasing kites.  Seen anything?
Did you just come from the vet, because you're dog is high as a kite.
I don't care if he is IS an airedale.
Nice work. I can't even get mine to stop drinking out of the toilet.
Pigs, sir. When pigs will fly.
She’ll have to come down sir, she’s higher than a kite.
Sir, we've received complaints of a howling wind.
Well, for starters, the law of gravity.
Excuse me sir - is that an Airedale?
And how long ago did he eat the brownies, sir?
Having a tail doesn't make it a kite!
Ignoring the sign is one thing, but willfully ignoring the laws of gravity, mister, is another.
No, sir- - it’s when pigs fly.
Sorry sir, no Emotional Support Kites allowed.
I think we both know what's up.
It's important he gets the scent right away. After 24 hrs these missing kites are almost impossible to find.
You are required to pick up after your kite.
Is that were a pig it would explain Trump's election.
Man kites dog
He's a little gassy today
Got a report of some guy walking his dog in the park, against regulations. You seen anything?
Actually, the barking is not what people are complaining about.
Sir, I know that wasn't rain
He saw a flying squirrel.
Sir, people can barely cope with birds pooping on them.
Is there a reason he's not wearing a collar?
It turns out old dogs CAN learn new tricks.
He's my seeing eye dog. I'm just taking a look around.
It was on his bucket list.
Sir, there’s a leash law and the law of gravity. I’m fining you for both.
I've had complaints that you're not picking up after your kite.
Stickin' his head out the car window not enough?"
That's right. And we also require a permit to fly fish.
Pretty good with such a short tail.
Well officer... what exactly does it look like I am doing?
First they told me no flying kites at the dog park and now you're telling me no flying dogs at the kite park.  Where am I suppose to fly this guy?
We're looking for a missing dog. Seen anything suspicious?
Yes sir, I am absolutely certain that  it was not one of the other kites that pooped.
He ain't nothin' but a hound dog, flyin' all the time.
I think your dog has gas.
The saying is, "Let sleeping dogs LIE."
Before I give you a citation:  How DOES that doggie in the wind blow?
I’m sorry, sir... only service-animal kites are permitted in this park.
Sir, your dog seems rather high-strung.
Even if it is a Skye Terrier you still have to use the dog park.
SPCA? I'm actually here with the FAA.
I'm taking him out for some air.
Well, tell him to hold it. We're getting complaints.
I'm sorry, sir, but it's against park rules to let sleeping dogs fly.
The high-pitched bark is from helium. He'll be coming down any second now.
I'll need to see his rabies tag, shot records, and pilot's license.
In this park disobeying the laws of physics is strictly prohibited.
He just doesn’t identify as a dog anymore
I'm sorry, Sir. But this park is only for right-handed people. I'll have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry, sir, but the law of gravity applies to everyone.
Have you tried Down Boy?
He likes the tail wind.
Sir, All dogs go to heaven. Just let go!
My wife said I’ll win the Caption Contest when dogs fly.
Sorry, but that's just not going to fly.
Now we’ve talked about this sort of thing before, Governor Romney.
The dog park is open now. Thanks for waiting.
Technically, officer, this IS a leash.
Airedale, right?
I can see he's an airedale,sir, but you still can't do that.
Someone with a squirrel kite wants you to leave.
Well all the PETA folks get mad when I leave him in the car.
May I suggest that you just mix some beano in with his kibble.
What do you expect me to do? There was no wind at the dog park.
I don't care if he identifies as a kite.
He's more bark than kite.
His dog license is fine - I need see to his pilot's license.
What do you mean "define kite"?
And you walked your dog before you flew him, right?
It's pissing in the wind we're worried about
I think your dog's eating too much fiber.
He identifies as a kite
Try introducing new kibble gradually. Makes them less gassy.
'Rain' is not yellow...
Well, SOMEONE'S kite peed on my head.
Try a shorter leash.
How convenient. The tail came with it.
My dog is on a leash.
Just be careful of flying squirrels. When they're around it's like the kite has a mind of its own.
Yes sir, I realize that he's not actually touching the park. But there are still no dogs allowed.
This levity doesn’t detract from the gravity of your situation
Sir, I'm afraid I'm standing in the reason I stopped you for!
That'd better be an emotional support kite.
He’s dreaming.
He ate all my marijuana brownies.
It was fight or flight.
Because no one else's kite has genitalia, that's why!
We only allow pigs to fly here, Sir.
Hey Bub...Gravity..it's not just a suggestion...it's the law!
If he tries to mark his territory again, I’ll have to ask you to leave.
Officer, let’s let sleeping dogs fly!
Its hard to keep a good dog down.
I see you finally got your kite fixed.
I don't CARE if he THINKS he's a kite.
The lady with the hydrant balloon already left.
I believe the sign says “No dogs ON the lawn”
Try it more authoritatively, “Down, boy.”
He's just always been kind of a free spirit.
Of course I remember you, sir. Your kite urinated on my leg last Sunday.
All bark and no kite, huh?
If you love him, let him go.
Wait. No. The man I'm looking for was flying a collie.
It's less a leash law violation and more of an air drop concern.
Sir, it's obvious from here that your dog is not neutered.
I don't care if he's 'above the law.'
And that's a service kite, right?
Not only are you flouting the rules, you are wantonly defying gravity
I'm investigating some missing helium.
Mr. Larson, for the last time there will be no Far Side shenanigans in this park.
We were playing Frisbee at the dog park and he just took off.
She got into the helium again?
Whaddaya mean he doesn't know the command "down boy?
This wasn't what I had in mind when I asked you to keep him off the grass.
Please curb your kite, sir.
So, you're telling me that this is a service kite.
Bird dog?
What did you feed him? He's as high as a kite!
I don't care if it is an Airedale, you can't fly it here.
I’m going to have to book you for violating the laws of physics.
I flew a cat for a while, but putting a leash on it just looked ridiculous
Sir, we don't allow mixed metaphors here..."
I know he's paper trained. That's why the kite flyers are complaining.
I'm more interested in why than how, sir.
Sorry, sir. Only pigs are allowed.
You say it’s a kite string; I say it’s a leash.
He’s my seeing high dog.
Are you aware of the six foot leash limit?
The difference between President Trump and a flying dog is the letter the F.
My head says put him down, but my heart says to just let him go.
Well it’s a fight-or-flight response.
He’s a lighter-than-Airedale.
Well, yes sir, the sign does say 'No dogs on the grass'...
In this town, we obey the laws of physics.
Look, buddy, we’ll be lucky at this point if Gary Larson doesn’t sue us.
I don’t give a flying Shih Tzu what breed it is sir.
Can I go next?
Can you try to keep him from sniffing the other kite's tails?
No,  I never heard of a Lighter Than Airedale Terrier.
You are not in violation of the leash law; the problem is with the law of gravity.
Is that a bird dog?
Sir, I'm afraid we're going to have to insist that you obey the law of gravity.
I don't care if he is a bird dog.
Well, Mr. Milan, you are in fact one hell of a dog trainer.
Sorry Officer; my dog thinks he's above it all.
Your kite has been sniffing the other kites' tails.
I don't care for the way you are defying the laws of physics, sir
Your kite just peed on my shoes"
Sir, I'm afraid gravity is the law around here.
You're scaring the other kites.
Sir, you're under arrest for breaking the law of gravity.
Sir, this isn't what your vet meant when she said "he needs more air"
Show me a sign saying “no balloon animals”.
Technically, he’s still on the grass
Technically, the dog is not in the park.
Look, it was cute when you flew the pig, but I'm not seeing the joke here.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to arrest you for breaking the laws of physics.
If it looks like a Dog, howls like a Dog, and has a tail like a Dog, it's not a Kite.
I'm going to overlook this simply because I don't have a box to check off for it.
No, sir.  Giving out poop bags for people to wear on their heads is not the solution.
Sorry sir, but we enforce the law of gravity in this park.
You must be the man who mistook his dog for a kite.
I'm sorry, but that's against the law of gravity.
He's always been light on his feet.
Keep your distance from the kid with the fire hydrant kite.
I see he takes his work as a bird dog very seriously.
That was not rain.
Well, yes, it does have a tail.
But he's not off leash.
We're looking for a man with glasses, a baseball cap, and a dog. Let us know if you see anything.
Max would stop at nothing to prove he was indeed a good boy.
Sir, that's not really what they mean by bird dog.
This is against the Law of Gravity.
I guess you can teach them new tricks.
We've been getting complaints from PETA AND Neil Degrasse Tyson...
I guess he is technically on a leash!!
They said the same thing about Trump getting elected.
He's not a kite, he's blimpadoodle.
So, that's what they call "Upward Dog"?
The park is all kite and no bark.
But officer, he's not off leash.
Sir, yelling bombs-away is not appreciated by the rest of our guests.
What's up? Dog?
Yes, I can see that he is on-leash.
Did you happen to see a man in a baseball cap walking a dog?
Who's a good kite?
What was the name of that obedience school?
I know he's on leash but I'm citing you under the Law of Gravity.
This is not what I meant when I said - "Strictly no dogs on park grounds."
Wouldn't it be easier if you just rolled down the window when you're driving?
they said he’d be impeached when dogs fly so....
Does your kite have all its shots?
I don't care if he's training for the Macy Parade.
You're lucky. Mine's afraid of the lightning.
Do you realize how many laws of physics you're violating right now?
Your kite keeps chasing its tail.
We're getting complaints, sir. You have to curb your kite.
If you wouldn't mind using both hands sir -- we lost a Dalmatian here a week ago, and it still hasn't come down.
Sir, your zipper’s down.
I don't care if it has a tail and flies; the dog park is over there.
I'm not saying you are violating a rule.  I am asking "How?"
And you call yourself a dog walker.
So you're saying that some old dogs can learn new tricks.
Technically. it doesn't qualify as a leash.
Terrierists are on the no fly list.
I don't care how high he can go. No one is above the law.
I'd like to see the quick, brown, fox jump over him now.
For one thing, it's against the law of gravity.
He ain’t nothin’  but a hound-dog, flyin’ all the time.
When we were driving we used to let him stick his head out of the car window and, well, one thing just lead to another.
I said please heel him not helium.
Yeah, you're right, it's probable safer for him than flying United.
Is that the only trick he does?
Yeah, crazy, but he wants to try out for the Macy’s parade.
Is your kite friendly?
There have been complaints of intermittent showers.
You can fly your dog only before 9 AM or after 11PM.
It’s a hybrid.
The right tail makes all the difference.
I tried a pig once but it just wouldn't fly.
Isn't it time to let go?
He’s my wingman.
I’m going to have to ask you to clean up after your kite
Couldn't he just stick his head out of the car window like all of the other dogs?
Wow; I still can't even get my dog to sit.
Sir, we are getting complaints that your kite is humping the other kites.
He likes his own space.
Sorry,sir. I think I threw the tennis ball too high.
Sir, your dog is frightening the other kites.
Sorry Sir, only flying pigs are allowed.
A new leash on life, huh?
Airedale?  Skye terrier?  Or is it from a long line of bird-dogs?
I wanted him to heel, so I gave him helium.
I could overlook the short tail and the long leash, but you also flagrantly break the law of gravity.
What can I say, he wasn't getting that thrill anymore from sticking his head out of the car window...
He looks like a good buoy.
It's the only way I  can walk him, officer. The pound named him Trump. So,I get home and find out he's full of hot air.
Sir, your kite is scaring the other kites.”
The balloon man says someone stole his helium tank. Have you seen anything suspicious?
Kites don't defecate, sir.
It’s obvious to me that your dog is high as a kite
Sir, your dog appears to be high as a kite.
Yes, I have heard of a bird dog.
You don't see anybody flying kites at the dog park do you?
That doesn't look like a leash to me
Sir, we ask people to please retrieve lost kites, not kite lost retrievers.
Bob, I don't care how much you like the Beatles; bring Lucy down, now.
It's my fault. I sent him to a Montessori obedience school.
Yes, it is a nice kite. But I'm still going to have to check his tags.
I was telling my wife that I was going to walk the dog, and she told me to “Go fly a kite’.
Well, it's not a pig. Carry on.
He IS on leash!
Well, I checked and you are technically compliant with the leash law.
And I’d tell you the same if you were walking a kite in the dog park.
If you took him to the dog park you could let him off the leash.
No. When PIGS fly.
I'm going to have to arrest you for breaking the law of gravity.
Sir, could you please pick up after your kite?
There's no such thing as a 'Kiteadoodle'.
Impressive, but we're getting complaints about the 'trickle-down' effect.
That's why I'm wearing a hat.
We're still working on "sit"
Let me guess.  You're blind.  That's your seeing eye dog.  And you are just taking a look around...
Yeah, but can he do any tricks?
If he's Underdog, then where's his cape?
My wife told me to take our dog and fly a kite.
Well, okay, but don't let him off leash.
Kindly curb your kite.
Sorry, but we enforce the Law of Gravity here.
This is not what I meant when I said  that the park’s dog policy was up in the air.
what did you tell him to fetch?
That your dog?
You say he’s practicing for Macy’s?
Dr. Pavlov. What exactly are you trying to prove now?
Must be a bitch to fly....
He’s looking for his frisbee
Bad kite!
I don't care if it's a rescue kite.
A longer tail would give you more lift.
Sorry sir, dog flying on Tuesdays only
No, there isn't an exception during the dog days of Summer
That shit ain't gonna fly.
This is far-fetched.
Just because you CAN do it, doesn't mean you SHOULD do it.
If he doesn't chase his dreams, who will?
I’ll let it fly this time.
He may well be an Airedale sir, but he still belongs in the Dog Park
The kid wants his dog back.
'Aloft' or not ... the leash limit is still six feet.
New here?
He takes fetch very seriously.
Is your wife out walking the kite?
Your dog appears to be high as a kite.
What’s up?
Having an inflated sense of self is not sufficient reason.
But, Officer, the sign clearly said "Keep your pets off the grass!."
I’m looking for a dog that swallowed a young girl’s helium balloon.
Sky Terrier?
He was raised by Kites.
Eventually, sticking his head out the car window wasn't enough.
Afghan hound? No Fly List. Bring him down.
Technically, yes, you are correct. He is on a leash.
NASA wants to talk to you.
The advertisement said fly-over, not fly Rover.
Sir, you need to pick up after your kite.
I see the thrill of the car window is a slippery slope.
Ruff winds today?
Oh yeah? Well, my dog thinks he's an opera singer. Now beat it.
Because the other kites don't poop on guests.
We've been getting complaints about him sniffing the tails of the other kites.
I beg to differ sir; ... a string can NOT be defined as a "leash'
You should've been here yesterday. It was RAINING cats and dogs.
It has a tail." Seriously? You're going with that
Because it's scaring the squirrel kite.
Have you tried cutting out gluten.
He can also roll over.
It would be funnier if he were flying you.
Like the wind in his face, does he?
Why not?  It’s my emotional support kite.
Does sticking his head out of the car window not do it for him?
'Very good sir, but it's not the physics that concerns me.'
Sir, they found your kite at the dog park.
If we make exception for you, Sir, everyone will come here with their flying dogs...
Just make sure he stays on the leash.
No, it does not matter if it's an Airedale, sir.
So the cat refused to go up again?
Well, yes, I understand that every dog has its day.
We've received a complaint that some people haven't picked up after their kites.
...but it's my emotional support kite"
Excuse me Sir, no hats allowed.
Another dog day afternoon?
But sir, he's on a leash.
Well, as long as you keep him on the leash, I think we're all fine here.
Have you seen a missing dog?
May I have a look at your doggie treats?
Randy you’ve got to quit coming here man. It’s freaking out the kids.
I'm very sorry sir, but we don't allow gliderdoodles in the park.
Sorry, only pigs are allowed.
I'm dogsitting for Superman.
Sir, there's no way that's rain.
You are mistaken sir....the expression is when PIGS fly.
He ate the whole pot of chili?
What am I supposed to do? He was born to herd kites.
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Excuse me, sir, but the park rules do include the law of gravity.
I can’t tell you how many times guys like you have tried the ‘It’s my seeing eye dog and I’m just taking a look around’ line.
I am arresting you for breaking the law of gravitation.
I always thought pigs would fly first.
I understand he identifies as a kite. Just clean up after him.
There was a dog hanging around the balloon kiosk sniffing the helium canisters. Seen a dog around here?
It’s OK. He’s an emotional support kite.
Mere flight does not make it a kite, sir.
It's not 'against the rules,' but it's frowned upon.
Sorry, but glide dogs are not allowed in the kite park.
It may be an Airdale. but thats no excuse.
He can fly but can he roll over?
Here at Roosevelt Kite Park we appreciate diversity. Welcome, sir.
Dog days are later this summer.
If I allow you to fly your dog they'll all want to
We received a report of a kite left in the dog park.
Nevermind the dog!  Did you notice where your Rhino landed?
I prefer to walk mine.
Put it in a car and let its head hang out the window like everyone else!
Yes sir, I know what 'bird dog' means. Do you?
Well, I don’t care what Lucy has in the sky so long as she stays on that leash.
Care to explain what just landed on my windshield?
You're right sir, it's not on the sign.
Pulled a double shift on airport luggage inspection; he won’t be coming down for a while.
Larry, that's not a kite, that's a dog and you know it.
Sir, the surrealist dog park is next door.
Sir, this leash is too long.
I'm getting reports that your kite is the party-pooper at today's event.
It's "High as a Kite" or "Raining Cat's and Dogs" - and anyway, you know it's a METAPHOR, right?
Whatever you do, mister, don't take him to Ben Franklin Park.
Skye terrier, eh?
Yes, but the other kites are potty trained.
I don't care that it's on a leash.
We're getting complaints about your kite sniffing other kite tails.
Naming your dog Roosevelt does not make this ok.
This is not who we are as a nation.
I don't care if it was on his bucket list!
No sir, I have never heard of a "seeing eye kite."
I believe the expression is, “When pigs fly”.
Sorry, sir, but park rules state the tail has to be at least 24 inches.
Is it flying? Is it on a string? Then leave me alone
I found your glasses.
Sir, it is obvious to me that you DO have a dog in this fight.
Yeah, I know, but the rule is a six foot leash, max.
The expression is “...when pigs fly”.
It’s against park rules, sir. Your dog doesn’t have a collar, and it’s disobeying gravity.
Not impressed.  Last week we had a pig.
Officer, he's not on the grass!
All I'm saying is you better be quick on the draw with the pooper scooper.
I don't care if he swallowed a helium balloon, the dog park's around the corner.
Is that the flying rat from the previous caption contest?  He has really stepped up his game.
Sir, that is all bark and no kite.
Box kites are permitted. Flying boxers is not permitted.
You ever had a bird crap on you? That's why.
Sorry, Sir.  You've been badly outclassed by London's Baby Trump."
Why not just stick his head out of the car window?
As below, so above.
Excuse me, Superman wants to know when you will be finished walking his dog.
Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?
You’ve got to keep Sparky away from the balloon guy’s helium tank.
You know you're violating the mixed metaphor statute, right?
I suppose you think your dog's above the leash law.
I don’t care that it’s an airdale, get it down.
Yes, the substance is now legal but not for canine consumption.
I'm glad you brought the collie instead of the corgi.  Like I told you, it won't fly if it doesn't have a tail.
Nice try pal, but it's still a dog and this is still a kite park.
Follow me, we've a cat stuck up a tree.
It started out as a game of fetch.
The car window just wasn't doing it for her anymore.
He must be an Airedale.
Does he know "down" yet?
It's a new breed.  I'll be training him to keep my neighbor's drone away from my house.
It's two hands for dogs. Okay?
True, technically his is on a leash...
He may very well be a Skye Terrier, but it's still no dogs allowed.
Sir, I assume you know this is not the dog park.
Will you stop saying, "It was his idea."
He can stay as long as he gets along with the rest of the kites.
How else is she supposed to train for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade?
My pet's name is Kite, Roosevelt Kite.
So THAT'S why they call them Airedales.
No, sir, this is the Kite Park.  The Helium-filled Carcass Park is on the other side of the hill.
Yes sir, it's a most impressive kite, but that doesn't alter the fact that it's wearing no collar, which is a $35 fine.
Just because there's not a specific rule against it doesn't mean it's not a bad idea.
Leaping for a Frisbee a hundred times just wasn't enough, huh?
Is it a skye terrier or an Airedale?
A longer tail would really add stability.
What’s up, dawg?
Sir, the sky is the limit.
When it's a pig, I'll be impressed.
Very clever sir, but no dogs allowed.
I don’t care if  his name is ‘Roosevelt Kite,’ there are no dogs allowed in this park.
Sure, and if he were chasing his tail, he'd be a helicopter.
Has he ever caught one?
We at Roosevelt Park strongly support kite diversity.
You've been asked to move down wind.
Sir, we found a kite with a leash on it at the dog park.
Sorry, sir, that's the rules. No kites in the dog park, and no dogs in the kite park.
I’m sorry officer, my dog self identifies as a kite
Sir, can you prove that is a Service Kite?
I’ve heard that once they’ve tasted flying, that you can never get away with just walking them.
He thought the lyrics were “I want to fly like a beagle to the sea, fly like a beagle let my kite carry me.”
No, it's not the same as bird droppings.
He's a very good buoy.
Sir. Your kite is leaking.
I understand you found him flattened on the road.  But, gees man, there are kids around here"
Can you make it do any tricks?
Don't tell me: An Airedale.
Please clean up after your kite.
I’ve  heard the flea meds give them gas.
Could you get him to stop marking his territory?
Of course, if it was a pig that would be a completely different matter.
...and you really don’t get why it’s only raining on you?
That is not what I meant when I told you to hightail it out of here.
I'd be more impressed if you did that with a cat.
If you let it go and it comes back, it's yours.
No, it isn't the leash law you've broken. It's the law of gravity.
It all started with his head out of the car window."
Excuse me, Sir. Your kite is leaking
Sir, that won’t fly here.

He got into the Red Bull.
The law of gravity, sir, are there for our protection. I'm afraid I'm going to have to issue a ticket.
If he starts humping another kite, he’s out of here!
His manic phase?”
You're under arrest for breaking the laws of physics.

I’ve never seen a kite that can chase its own tail!
What’s the problem? My dog’s on a leash.
He's training for the Macy's Day Parade.
The 'Trump Baby' balloons were sold out.
. . . but the sign said keep dogs off of the grass.
From the way his tail is wagging, I'd say he can see the skate park, water park, zip line park, and disc golf park.
We can't make exceptions for bird dogs.
Sir, emotional support dogs no longer fly for free
I thought you said you didn’t have a dog in this flight.
It was a metaphor, not a suggestion.
I'm not as interested in how he stays up there as I am in what's been coming down.
All right, but no tricks.
I realize you went to the trouble of putting him on a leash, but that's not really the issue here, sir.
Sir, I'm from Animal Control. Have you seen a stray dog, brown, extremely lightweight, trailing a length of twine?
I agree that you’re not violating the letter of leash laws, but let’s talk about the spirit of leash laws.
Wherein lies the tail?
But somehow he hates walks.
You realize we have a big enough problem with the pigeons around here.
Sorry sir, but that just won't fly in this park.
Okay... but if he poops on somebody's head, you're outa here.
For the last time Gary, there is no such thing as Taxidermy Tuesday.
The problem is how he's marking his territory.
It's fine, he's a service kite.
You the guy with the helium tanks?
Ignorance of the law of gravity excuses no one.
I know, I know, but he got bored with the frisbee.
You are going to have to curb your dog, sir.
But he is off the grass.
He doesn't know.
His bark is worse than his kite.
Touché, sir. The sign does say “No walking your dog.”
Okay, so pigs can fly. We still have Trump.
I don't care if he's a bird dog, you need to curb him.
People are complaining about a UFO, and by "U" they mean urinating.
He's my therapy kite.

In this wind, she's a real bitch to fly.
Box kites are allowed. Boxer kites aren't.
So, he's an Airedale, is he?

You and I both know it is just a matter of time.

Old, new, doesn't matter, that trick isn't fooling anyone.
What happens when he lets a little gas escape?

This is how Ben Franklin discovered shitstorms.

Bean burritos again?

There’s no point in saying “Down” I suppose?

He won't stay up long with that tail.

Boxer kite? I've heard of a box kite, but never a boxer kite.
I don’t care if it’s a Skye terrier, your string is over 6 feet!
Don't you know every dog has his day.
His day,eh?
I booted the when pigs fly guy, too.
Pigs, yes, pigs can fly, sir.  But no dogs.
You're walking someone else's dog? You must be kidding.
Sorry, we still consider him a bite risk
It's the law. Curb your kite.
I trust you have your inflatable pooper scooper?
I'm with ICE. We have had a report of some sort of coyote operation in this district.
The fact that you pick it up afterwards misses the point.
Your kite is against the law - the law of gravity.
Thank you for respecting the on-leash rules, but if he bites the kites you'll have to leave.
Ben Franklin must be jealous...
You are under arrest.  Your dog is higher than a kite
If he wants to be a kite who am I to say no?
Technically he's over the park, not in the park.
Do you have a license to fly that dog?”
Relax, he was already dead.
I hope you brought enough pick-up bags for everyone, sir.
You need to tell him he's not a kite, but let him down slow.
I've had a complaint that he bit one of the other kites.
'" Benjamin Franklin you ain't."
I must disagree sir, it is not raining.
Sir, you are in non-compliance with city ordinance C.2-1509, Conforming with Newtonian Physics. You'll have to come with me.
I don't care if he ate your medicinal stash and is as high as you say. You still can't bring him here.
Sir you cannot wear a hat in the park.
I didn't make the rules.  That leash is too long.
We are getting complaints about the saliva.
He always loved chasing the kites
Steer Baxter over to that box kite. If that one isn't crammed full of cocaine I'll eat my hat
Are you sure he likes that?
It looks like a dog to me, sir.
He’s a rescue.
Well, technically, it’s still a leash.
My sister's kite is a pig.
Excuse me sir.Tomorrow is fly your pet day.
Weeeeee, indeed, sir!
Before he died, he loved taking walks in the kite park.  This was his final request.
Please pick up after your kite, sir.
No sir, that was not just a few drops of rain.
You're saying this ISN'T the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade audition?
No diaper, no flying. Park rules.
You need a special dog licence for that sir.
Is that an emotional support kite sir?
We were just running along and up he went.
It's OK, Skye terriers are bred for this.
Sir, we do allow dogs here but they can't be as high as kites.
Was told to see a man about a dog.
I'm sorry sir but you're going to have to put your dog down.
Damn good air, Dale
The dog got into the edibles again, didn't she?
Wallenda is an unusual name for a dog.
Hotdogging is not allowed, sir.
Remember: if he poops, you catch.
But he doesn’t like frisbees
Sir, your emotional support animal is disturbing the other flyers.
Rover got into the pot brownies again?
Does he think he is an airedale.
You're okay on the leash law, but we'll need a drug screening.
No service kites allowed, sir.
The orange baby inflatable was pushing it, but a dog is not okay.
You do realize there is a potential for a real problem here...
Nice bird dog you got there.
I rescued him from a dog mill in South Korea, now he’ll do whatever I ask!
It's the only way I can get him to stop barking
Dogs are prohibited in the park. But since your dog self-identifies as a kite - he can stay.
Just don't let him off-leash.
Who's higher, you or your kite?
You're going to have to put him down.
Can I pet your kite?
I don't care if it's an Airedale, get it back to the dog park.
Sir, people have complained that your kite is drooling
Do you have a plastic bag?
But my dog’s name IS Roosevelt.
Sorry, he just took off without me.
I know all dogs go to heaven, but I can’t seem to let go of this one yet
If he caught one, what would he do with it?
The expression goes, "Let sleeping dogs lie."
Sir, we're going to need to have your dog put down
Sure, the leash law may not "state it specifically," sir, but it's definitely implied.
It's a box terrier kite.
Don't worry, he's housebroken
I'm sorry sir, but we've been given orders to crack down on inflation.
I’d be more impressed if it was a pig.
The man with the cat kite wants some time now.
I'm getting complaints that it's raining.
We had a complaint. Please walk your dog before you fly him here.
Sir, you need to curb your kite.
But I went to the dog park. They said to come here.
Excuse the pun, sir, but your dog is as high as a kite.
In all my years on the force, this is the first time I've seen a case of man kite's dog.
Have you considered every possible scenario here?
Would you mind flying a little further downwind?
The others feel your use of helium is, let’s say.....egregious.
Sir I’m going to have to ask you to...tell me how you do that.
Sir, NASA would like to have a word.
We only allow pigs to fly!
I don't care that he's an Airedale, he's still gotta go!
That's not what "Dog Days of Summer" means, sir.
Bob, we've been getting the "yellow rain" complaints again.
Its easier then walking him!
His parents were both bird dogs.
I assume she's an Airedale.
'Service kite' or not, sir, no dogs allowed.
Sir, I understand it's somewhat of a gray area but you'd still have better luck at the dog park.
No, sir, the policy is that you're allowed to fly *with* your emotional support animal.
Ahhh...I've never seen an Airedale fully trained.
I noticed you didn't bring a plastic bag.
You are in the wrong park. The gassy dog field is two blocks south.
Do you have a per-mutt?
You’re not in Kansas anymore.
In the park, over the park, it just doesn’t matter, sir.  Dogs aren’t allowed.
I don’t care if it floats. You still have to bag it.
Sir, you're going to have to pick up after your kite
Don't mind him-he's practicing for the parade"
no Sir ! The tail is not the problem !
We’ve received complaints that’s he is biting tails
Sir, I said it'd be ok when pigs fly.
Sorry sir, my dog ate the brownies again. Now he's high as a kite.
Hello, officer. I'm glad that you're wearing a hat"
Riding with the window down had become a bit passe"
I'm afraid I'll need to see your service kite license.
I'm sorry, but he keeps chasing the other kites' tails.
Just tell me he's done his business.
Some little kid said a dog ate her balloon.
I’m 98% sure that isn't how Ben Franklin did it.
"May I  see your pooper-scooper, Sir?"
I’m sorry, but he still has to have a license.
SERIOUSLY  ??? There’s an ASPCR  ???
I'm afraid he's all bark, no kite.
No, he is not "on leash".
Any chance your dog has had access to marijuana? It looks high.
All right. But make sure he stays on the leash!
I can only get mine to chase his own tail
She was a perfectly fine service dog on those transatlantic flights. Then she got bitten by the travel bug. Now I can't get her out of the sky.
What kind of diet did you put him on - beans?
Sir, your dog better have peed before this part of your walk.
That must be a bitch to steer.
Cannabis Card, please...
I don't care if your dog is named Kite; you can't fly him here.
I know, but he thinks he's a kite" doesn't cut it.
Sir, if you don't remove your MAGA hat, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
That science diet giving him gas again?
It's OK as long as you keep him off the grass.
Let me guess.....cannabis doggie treats.
Sorry, only pigs allowed.
Down, boy.
Winds are a little “ruff” today.
He's always been an adrenaline junkie. Even as a puppy.
Technically, that is not a leash.
not bad,but can you do it with a PIG?
I suppose since he is on a leash...
Sorry, dogs are only allowed to be flown before 9 a.m. and after 6 p.m.
Aren't you the guy from last week with the flying pig ?
Sticking his head out of the car window wasn't good enough for him anymore!!
What can I say? He loves Mary Poppins.
Letting your freak fur fly?
Sorry Officer he’s as high as a kite
It's not just a dog . . . it's an Airedale.
You say you bought that kite from a road runner?
Just cause you’re dog’s high
doesn’t make him a kite!
Sorry. It's cat day.
Good new sir we have recovered your kite.
I'm not going to tell you again sir, if it is a therapy dog, you need to provide documentation.
Sorry sir. Airdales or Skye Terriers only.
I want to see if reindeer really know how to fly.
Sir, perhaps you care to explain to me why your 'kite' just pooped on my head?
You're still going to need to curb him.
Yes I can see that he's on a leash, but that's not really the point.
Skye Terrier, am I right?
Yes, his name is Roosevelt. Why do you ask?
If he soils my uniform you're in deep doo-doo.
Don't worry, he just went.
I'm guessing he's an Airedale.
Do the poops have parachutes?
Wow you’re really taking the open car window to the next level.
Technically, the law says "collar," but I'll let you off with a warning this time.
It's O.K. as long as he stays on the leash
Try walking him next time...it's so much better for everyone.
the issue lies more in your lack of proper harnessing rather than the morality of the situation
I assume you'll still be picking up after him.
Actually, as kites go, yours may be 'Best in Show'"
I agree that’s an innovative use of helium but the high pitched barking is disrupting the other kite flyers
Please pick this caption. I have never won the New Yorker Cartoon Caption contest, and I'd really like to.
You said I had to keep him on a leash!
Kibble gives him gas.
I'm sorry, the park simply doesn't allow baseball caps.
You're fine, as long as he stays on the leash.
You should see it with a tail wind.
Last week there was a guy flying a Boxer. Very hard to control.
It does makes picking up after him more of a challenge.
Sir, this isn't a dog park, though I'll give you both credit for the workaround.
Sir, that’s a Water Spaniel, not an Airdale. I’ll have to ask you to reel it in.
Akita?
It's pretty clear that it was your kite that soiled the field.
...but it's my therapy kite.
What? It was on his bucket list!
I don't care if he's bored at the dog park. You can't fly him here!
Someone posted a video of you tying your dog to the kite, it went viral. About twenty thousand people are on their way here, right now, to kill you. Politics and religion will get you a lone nut once in awhile but you do not mess with dog people.
Forget the plastic baggie, you're gonna need a net.
I SEE YOUR DOG HAS SOME FLATULENCE
He is retrieving his fribee.
She really should've done her business before she got up there.
Granted, she's got a tail and she's flying just like the others - but one drop of pee or poo and you're out of here.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to please curb your kite.
'I don't care what he had for breakfast. That's not what we meant by learning to harness wind power.'
I'm sorry, but you also need a pooper scooper balloon
Just so you know, this is an off-leash park.
Look, buster, I don't care if it's an Airedale...
It doesn't matter if  your dog is now a kite, you still have to clean up after him.
May I suggest you try a breed with a slightly longer tail?
Look, even though the law you are breaking is one of physics, I still feel pretty comfortable arresting you.
Don't expect bail - your partner's a flight risk
Did you say "shedding"? That's not what I'm concerned with.
This explains the golden shower complaints.
I've received some complaints about your 'kite' marking his territory.
Helium license ?
Officer, I have a leash.
Yes, sir, I do see its tail, but just because a cat has kittens in the oven, you don't call them biscuits.
Sir, were you aware that this is a right hand only kite flying zone?'
No, I can't prove that's your kite poop. It's just a hunch.
He better not have any accidents up there.
Housebroken?
Either diaper him up or reel him in!
Fine, I take it back, Donald. I'd vote for you for dog catcher.
My schnauzer has gas problems too.
Hey, your kite just peed on me.
That's some bird dog, buddy.
That's my Airdale
I love your jacket. Where did you get it?
I don’t care if he is an Airedale, it’s still against the laws of physics.
I know, smart guy: 'It's a bird, it's a plane, it's...Underdog.'        
 Save it for the Thanksgiving Parade.
Sir, you and your dog are under arrest for breaking the law of gravity.
Ok pal. Let me see your poop bag.
Sir, it is not a dog park, it is a kite park.
I didn't see you ask anyone else to clean up after their kite.
Defying gravity is against park regulations.
Dogged determination doesn't count in kite competitions.
Yes, sir.  Six feet or less.
I don't care what your cat said you should do, mister. Reel in the dog, now.
Look buddy - rules are rules....  If you're going to fly your dog, do it in the dog park over on Maple Street.
If you really loved her, you'd set her free.
You really should change his diet.
My hat is wet.
It's OK officer he is a service dog.
Sir, your dog looks high.
Didn't I see you in the carpool lane with a mannequin yesterday?
We've received several complaints that your dog bit the mail drone.
Sir, even if you're not technically "walking" him, you still have to pick up after him...
Do you have proof that he is indeed a service animal?
You got me this time. Last week I dismissed you from the dog park for kite flying.
Yes, you still have to clean up after him.
I guess we’ll let the judge decide if he’s technically on or off leash or if kitedoodle is actually a breed.
I say the dog IS on the grass.
Hindendog.
I'm gonna let it float...this time.
I'm sorry, but the Dog Days of Summer don't start here until next week.
That’s quite a story and a nice try, Sir-  but you do realize, that’s not even a pig.
This felt like the best option because we just weren’t ready to let him go.
My dog ate my permit.
Sir, we're getting complaints that he is chasing others tails.
You have to bring her down. People are getting wet.
But he's on the leash!
That doesn’t fly here.
You're the guy who's kite was barking in the dog park!
Wouldn't it be easier to tell your kid you found a nice farm for it, rather than saying the string broke?
It's a skye terrier. You got a problem with that?
You still have to pick up his poop.
I know, but the dog park was closed due to wind.
You must be the gentlemen whose kite just died in his hot car.
I am sorry Sir, but park rules require your dog to be on a leash that is no more than 12 feet long.
It's not the leash law that I'm concerned about.
You're saying the Social Security Administration is telling everyone to do this when they apply for Social Security benefits?
Dog day is tomorrow afternoon.
I told you before- no taxidermy advertising is allowed in the park.
I'm sorry, sir; you cannot fly your dog without a helmet.
Don't worry officer, she already peed.
Sir, are you high?
Let me guess: At the dog park you’re known as the guy with the kite.
Yes, I suppose it's true that the sign only says "no dog walking."
I got a call about a rodent problem...Reel it in please.
Go fly a kite.
The dog park was full
Sorry sir, but dog days are over.
FYI...There's a pet cemetery a few blocks from here.
The Anti-Gravity Dog Walk was last week.
Now if it were a pig, we might allow it.
Sir, this isn't California - dogs cannot be high.
Sir, we have rules, very simple rules.
I don't dare if he's your emotional support kite...
So, you and your skye terrier are just out for a walk in the park?
We've had reports that he's humping other kites.
Show me how you did that and you can stay.
Relax, he already did his business before I launched him.
Have you seen the YouTube video of the Shih Tzu who can yodel?
But sir, he’s not off leash!
It's my new seeing-eye drone.
That looks longer than six feet.
But his name is Roosevelt.
"Don't forget to clean up after your kite."
Well,you're still going to have to clean up after him when he comes down.
It's okay, just don't let him off the leash.
Look Mac, if it were up to me he could stay...but the kites have complained that they aren't allowed in the "Dog Park", so you and Lindbergh gotta go.
That dog better be wind broken!
Well they should have told you about this breed's aerodynamic issues at the shelter. You still need to use the dog park.
I'm sorry. If you don't have a baggie, you'll have to bring him down.
Has your kite been neutered?
That's right. He's the first soldier in the new Space Force.
Sir, if you let go who is going to retriever?
I thought you said your dog does not fly."
"That is not my dog.
Do you have plastic bags to clean up after your kite?
Didn't you consider that the bloating was extremely odd?
What, haven't you ever seen a Boxer kite
Has your kite had its shots?
I am training it to be an Uber drone.
Darn dog got into my stash
Did you happen to see an unleashed Airedale?
Once airborne, there's a fine for dropping off payload
No Sir, I've never heard of canine cannabis.
The guys at the Humane Society warned me he was a bit flighty.
The lady in the skirt wants to breed her kite with yours.
I'll bet you were for Romney, right.
I do not care if his name is Kite, he can fly and you are a democrat.  Adults cannot play in this park.
Sir, I don't really care if your dog is named Roosevelt.
Okay, it's a leash. Where's your poop bag?
My kids are watching. I told them I’d get him to heaven.
Sir, the dog days of summer don't start for another 4 weeks.
It's not that you're flying him, its the howling and whimpering.
He got into the burritos.
As long as you keep him on leash, we'll let it go this time.
Sir, are you aware that you are breaking the laws of nature?
just be careful... last week a gentleman lost his porcupine in a shifting wind.
Remember, stoop and scoop still applies
Have you considered changing his diet?
I've never heard of a Lighter Than Airedale!"
But I'm just the tail wagging the dog, sir.
An airedale?
Sir you know this park has a strict no leash policy.
May I see your dog license, pilot license, registration and certification of insurance?
Sorry, sir, emotional support kites only.
Could you please land your kite in the dog park.
But it’s my comfort kite sir.
Ok.... but keep him away for that kite shaped like a hydrant.
No, I would not believe he's chasing flying squirrels.
Try grinding up a Beano tablet and sneaking it in his food. Worked wonders with my wife.
i'm visually impaired, this is my seeing eye dog,  I'm just looking around!
I don’t care if his grandfather did fly on the Hindenberg.
Can I have what he is having?
The vet warned that she might balloon with this new flea shot.
Sir,I am citing you for not curbing you kite.
I guess there's not much I can do since its technically on a leash.
Who's your taxidermist?
I'm looking for a lost a medium sized brown dog? He goes by the name of helium.
Stop feeding him beans.
Don't worry - he's on a leash.
You’d be surprised how many people make the same mistake - even with the new sign.
When I did it, my voice just got really squeaky.
So how in the world did you ever come up with, "Icarus?"
Got into your marajuana again, did he?
Airedale, Schmairedale; read the sign.
I always wanted an Airedale
Sir, you need a permit for that.
I suppose you fly your kite at the dog park?
Can I throw him a frisbee.?
Police dogs are friendly outgoing courageous now give it back.
can you make it bark, i want to hear what it sounds like with Helium :)
No anatomically correct kites allowed sir!
It's a rare breed.
There are complaints about the barking.
I don't care if his name is Fala, you can't fly your dog here.
It’s called the Right Handed Kite Flying Competition for a reason.
This flies in the face of our park leash laws.
You know you still have to clean up after him.
I didn’t say you couldn’t. I just wondered *how.*
I don't care if you scooped it.  It fell on a little girl's head.
No officer, it’s the latest in connectivity -WiFido!
Aren't you Mitt Romney's kid?
I’m with the language cops. We can’t have folks saying: “Higher than a dog.”
Sir, if she poops, you still have to pick it up
I've got him on a leash.
The law is pretty specific.  Medium size dogs require at least a 30-pound test line.
Just because it has a tail it doesn’t make it legal.
No dogs allowed in the park, so go fly a kite!
You think this is weird? Go see them herding cats at the Nixon Lasso Playground.
Nice try, Mr. Bailey. You still have to take him to the dog park.
He appears to be as high as a kite.
Fine, but there’s a fine if she bites the kites.
But officer, the sign only says ‘No dogs on the grass.’
You obviously have a lassie-faire attitude to park signs.
Sir, would you happen to know anything about reports of a man walking a kite at the dog park?
As long as he doesn’t chase anyone else’s tail.
Just because kites have tails doesn't mean all things with tails are kites.
The fact that he's an Airedale is beside the point, sir.
There have been complaints that you are not picking up after your kite.
The problem isn’t that it’s a live animal. The problem is it’s pooping on the kids.
I never thought I'd hear myself say it, but take your dog off the leash, mister.
Pigs are OK. But no dogs.
Sir, if that is your comfort kite I will need to see its papers.
I don't care how high he does it, you still need to pick it up.
Just so you know, the fine is triple if you don't pick up after him.
We've received a complaint that you are not picking up after your dog.
Leash only sir.  No strings attached.
Okay, but you'll still have to pick up after him.
"Sir the area for pet-flying is further down. See my hand? I've already confiscated a hedgehog today"
Never seen an airedale/skye terrier mix before
Listen, buddy, the only things allowed with tails in here are kites. Got that?
It better not rain!  Understand?
No animals were injured in the drawing of this cartoon.
High as a kite" is no excuse
Ever heard of the law of gravity?
We received a report of flying pigs. Carry on
And now you’re gonna tell me that kites can walk.
Of course  I understand,  he’s just a bit gassy this morning...
There's no exception for Airedales .
Why can't you just roll down the window of your car?
Sir, you need to curb your Airedale.
He thinks he's a pig.
Sir, only registered emotional support dogs are permitted to fly.
The rules clearly state that the tail must be at least fifteen inches.
Filling your dog with helium is not the only issue - there's been numerous complaints about his high pitched bark.
Best bird dog in the state!
No officer, he just ate a drone.
Sorry sir, it has to be an emotional support animal to fly.
Are you feeding him properly??
Wrong park, Mister Peabody.
He ate a whole pot of beans . . .been up there ever since.
Sir, a dingo did NOT eat your kite.
It better be toilet trained.
Do you really think pugs can fly?
I don't care if it's a Skye terrier.
My wife is having an affair.
It doesn't matter that they all have tails...
Sir, the dog park is the next block down.
I need him back now. It's time for takeoff, and Dog is my co-pilot.
Sir, I’m issuing you a citation for non-conformity. Earlier today we discovered that you’re living in a non-beige house, and now this...
Sorry, sir, we only allow flying pigs.
But he's an Airedale.
Sorry, we don't allow leashes longer than 6 feet
Just don’ t fly him over the picnic area!……
And don't tell me he's an Airedale
Airedale, schmerdale.
This goes against the laws of our city, our state, our country, and Newton.
If I see him off the lead again, there will be a fine.
Your dog has the worst case of gas I've ever smelled.
Next park over.
Can he stop howling and just fly?
The Macy’s Parade? No, that’s on 77th.
I got a complaint that your kite may not be potty trained.
Yes, it is very impressive, but could you put a diaper on him...we've had some complaints.
No,it wasn't a seagull.  I'm afraid you're going to have to leave now sir.
Is your kite trained?
Well, it doesn't seem to be the same to HIM....
You're the kite guy from the dog park, aren't you?
Bring it down.  The tail must be at least 3 feet long.
Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?
We tried off-leash for awhile, but that didn't work.
It’s a form of artistic expression to help save the wolves, officer. My pig kite is no longer relevant in this administration.
It's my wolfhound.  He heard that Trump was elected President so he's looking for the flying pigs.
Amazing. Still a dog, so you have to go.
But officer, his name is really Kite
We truly regret any pain and confusion this hurtful and inappropriate sign may have caused any of this nation's more than 4,700 flying dogs.
But his name is Kite...
Sir, I know he's on a leash, but we don't allow dogs in this park.
Sir, you’ll have to keep your dog on the ground. The only animals allowed to fly here are pigs.
I don't really care if it's an airedale.
What? You've never seen a black cop before?
No sir, you can't fly a kite at the dog park either.
You should meet the lady waiting for her kite to poop in the dog park...
Your kite is a dog.
New trick?
Sir, dogs can only be flown over in the Dog Park...
We've had some complaints.
I like yours the most.
Yes, he is a good boy.
Sir, this is a kite park, you'll have to fly your dog elsewhere.
Sir,  I don't care if he is on a leash, bird dogs aren’t allowed here.
No , you are doing it right , they are all  doing it wrong
Ben Franklin's on the phone.
Two martinis and he always flies like a kite
Not helium? Let me hear his voice.
Nothing that interesting is allowed in this city since that prick Giuliani ruined it for everybody.
I am with the ASPCA sir. We need to speak to your dog.
I told my dog there's nothing to fear but fear itself
Kites do not, in fact, need predators to weed out the infirm and strengthen the herd.
Still safer than having him fly United
Excuse me, sir.  Do you have a permit to fly that dog?
And just how long has Fala been waiting for the frisbee?"
It's fine, as long he's fixed.
I must warn you that dogs attract lightning.
Glad to see you can still get it up!
No, sir, I don’t believe that was a passing rain cloud.
Kite park, dog park, ... you still have to clean up after your dog!
Any pigeons you can catch, you can keep.
When they go low, we go high.
No metaphors allowed.
Sir, we have reason to believe your dog has  flies.
Poop will be your downfall.
Well I guess it's ok if he identifies as a kite.
I'm from the TSA and there are new regulations about flying with your dog ...
Storm's coming, better pack it in.  At least, I felt a sprinkle.
...bucket list
But officer, he's a kite runner.
No officer, but I’ll keep my eyes out for him.
He believed he could fly!
No, I meant you have to bring him down, not, y'know, 'put him down'.
No dogs aloft.
Some people think he's got some Springer Spaniel in him, but he's just a stray I found hovering over my front yard one day.
I’m sorry, sir, but we’ve had numerous complaints from PETA about your kite.
Listen, this isn't that kind of kite park.
We cannot make exceptions sir. All dogs must be on a leash.
I presume that's a Skye terrier.
Do you see a sign that says Dog Park?
He LOVES chasing pigeons.
Sir, there are better ways to deal with a mid-life crisis
Nice try, Jenkins. No dogs alowed in the park.
Your kite have a license"
Helium enemas are illegal, you know.
Keep him on leash this time, the lady with Skye Terrier doesn't want another litter of balloon dogs
Rules, buddy...'No dogs'"
I do believe there are other ways to avoid fleas and tics.
Don't worry officer, he's a professional!
OK, fine, but if he craps you are so busted.
I see you're making the best of the dog days of summer.
No Airdales!
I take it you’re Canadian.”
Don’t saying anything. He’ll be deflated if you think he doesn’t fit in.
How often do National Kite Day and National Gary Larson Day coincide?
I'm not disputing that he's a good dog, but that still doesn't make him a good kite.
He also swims.
Sir, we have complaints about your dog marking his territory.
I am only going to tell you one more time, if your kite keeps on mounting other kites, you are both going to have to leave.
Your dog is in violation of our local Ordinance on Gravity.
Would you be interested in being on the cover of the fall Parks and Recreation Department brochure?
Well, as long as he stays off the grass...
You should thank your lucky stars you're not an unarmed black child in this situation.
He doesn't know he can't fly" is not an excuse.
Your kite is the leash of my concerns.
Sir, I believe you're in​ the wrong park.
I'll need to see your pet license and your license to operate a pet.
The law says leash your dog, not launch your dog.
Ya' know, poodles go a lot higher.
I don't think I ever heard the saying 'GO FLY A DOG'
It's the Dog Days of Summer
Yes, I understand that he's a bird dog. You're still going to have to pick up after him.
I could have sworn it said Akita Flying Competition.
You're playing pretty fast and loose with those leash laws, pal.
I don't care that the helium makes him float, but you have to find a way to stop that squeaky barking.
Yes, you still need to pick it up, even if it flies into the bushes.
That is one way to get around the park’s no dog policy."
I dont care how much easier it is to find the ball!
Let me guess... it's an Airdale.
Great job with the tail.
You better clean up after it.
The maximum leash length is six feet sir.
Could you bring him down? This isn't his day.
I'm sorry Mr. Romney, but that is just plain cruel.
An airedale, you say?
The tail is not regulation length.
Sorry, the tail doesn't meet regulations.
How much is that doggie in the wind?
Must be hard to keep away from trees.
Sir, you are a disgrace....Now tuck your shirt in.
Just a reminder; always clean up after your kite.
They must be tethered at all times.
He swallowed a helium balloon
You say his mother was a papillon? Tell him to flutter on down.
You know I read Helium's bad for dogs
Leash or no leash, you still need a permit.”
Mind explaining how your dog got high as a kite?
...So long as it's consensual.
You think it's safe standing under him like that?
Well then, what DOES dog days of Summer mean then?
You want the dog park across the street.
I'm asking you, sir, because, none of the other kites are dropping... well... droppings.
I don't care if he has gas. You can't fly a dog in the park.
I just want to know what you’ll do if he gets caught in a tree.
Please take your Airedale to the Dog Park!
The dog park is in the field over to your left.
You say this is how Ben Franklin invented the shock collar?
No, no, you want to keep the nose pointing *into* the wind.
But, Officer, he's a Skye Terrier!
Are you saying your dog's name is Roosevelt?
Sir, I understand that everyone's been coping with the Rapture in their own way, but you're going to have to let your dog move on sooner or later.
If that is a Chihuahua, it'll have to come with me.
Please, just make sure you clean up after your kite.
I won't ask you how. Just don't.
The sign on the gate says, 'Keep your dog on a short leash at all times.'
I'm looking for a dog...
I dunno, it's pretty big for a flying squirrel.
We'd like to enlist him as a Border Collie, flying reconnaissance along the new southern wall.
Sorry sir. No kites that mock celebrities.
What's your vector, Victor?
Can you at least get him to stop sniffing their tails?
Beagle, fleagle -- I don't care if his mother mated with an eagle.  He belongs in the dog park.
Weren’t you flying a kite at the dog park the other day?
He's just trying to fetch my kite.
How would you like it if we flew kites in your dog park?
Curb your dog sir.
Can you pick up your kite poop please?
Support animal?"
Just because it has a tail doesn't mean it's a kite.
Ms. Poppins wants her dog back.
Only airedales and skye terriers allowed, sir.
Sir, I'm going to have to insist that you pick up your kite's poop.
Is he sky-broken?
I don't care that your dog can fly, it's disturbing the children.
I'll have to lock him up until he learns to stop lifting his leg on other people's kites.
No exceptions, sir ...poop and scoop is still the law!
Sir, the dog-flying section is on the other side.
I don't care if the dog park is closed
Let me guess: Your dog ate your kite again.
Just curious, sir, were you aware of a missing helium canister?
They're supposed to be on a leash, not a string.
His father was Underdog!
It doesn’t matter that you’re from Colorado; it’s not legal here.
Constipated and flatulent.
There has been a complaint about your kite.
No, I'm not high, sir. Just the dog.
That's right.  If he didn't sign the waiver, I'm afraid he'll have to come down.
I don't care that she'll burp out the helium soon, reel her in now!
Sir, we've received complaints that you're not picking up after your dog.
I don't care if you named him "Sully", he's still a dog.
No, Sorry sir, it is still a dog.  A cool dog, but just a dog
That's a good buoy.
I'm sorry, sir, but you must let sleeping dogs lie.
Sir, there have been complaints that your kite is barking at the other visitors.
We are getting complaints he's humping the other kites.
I'm not worried about you, but can HE hold it?
Have you seen a missing dog - medium size, a bit shaggy with floppy ears?
I assume you have a permit, sir?
As long as he's on a leash, right?
I don't care what he learned in obedience school. Bring him down.
I’m sorry sir, we allow box kites, not boxer kites.
Very impressive, but you need to take him to the dog park.
My Taxidermist said she got a great deal on helium...
How do you keep it stable with such a short tail?
Sure, but will he hunt?
Sam, I need your help.  I'm having trouble getting my pig off the ground.
Sir, the fact that he was neutered does not change the situation.
Thank you for keeping your dog on a leash but chasing kites is not permitted.
Even though your dog’s not on the ground, you still have to pick up after him!
Can I have a turn?
It doesn't matter that he's an airedale he's still not a kite.
He holds it in.
Go fly a kite is not the response that will keep me from arresting you.
PETA says NO !!
But Officer, my dog is on a leash.
His grandfather was Underdog.
I have the bag in my pocket.
Not cool. Next thing the cats will want equal rights.
Just be advised it is going to start raining cats.
He's always been a joiner...
I expect you to pick up after it.
Have you tried Beano?
Park ordinance requires you to pick up after your kite, sir.
Sir, this is an off-leash area, you can let him fly.
It's a good thing you didn't come during off-leash hours.
I’m sorry, pigs can’t fly here.
You can't get around the dog ban this way.
Congratulations! You've won Best in Show.
No problem.  But please observe the pooper scooper law.
Sir, this park is closed to Airedales.
No getting high in the park, sir, even for dogs!
Sir, you’ve been a warned before about not flying wolf
I'm not high. He's high!
No, emotional support animals are not allowed yet.
Sir, you're taking the "what's up-dog?" joke way too far.
In this community it's a regulation to have a plastic bag when flying dogs.
Bird dog or not, I'm going to hound you until you rein him in.
It might just be rain, but you still need to leave.
I said Let Sleeping Dogs Lie, not Let Sleeping Dogs Fly!
This isn't what we meant by off-leash laws.
Sorry sir, dog flying is at the 81st Street entrance.
It's not about the leash law.
I don't care if you gave him the choice of heel or helium.
Right hand only, sir
The others are concerned that you haven’t walked your dog recently”.
Let me guess - he's your emotional support animal and he lifts you up.
It’s a service kite
Well I have to admit I was wrong when I said this wouldn't fly"
You'll still have to pick up after him.
There's a guy trying to walk a kite over at the dog run wants to talk to you.
Sir, we've had a couple of complaints that your dog is posing a hazardous waste risk.
I just wanted to let you know that this is an off leash area.
I think we all know that wasn't a light rain.
Please stop sniffing the other kites
Sir, your dog must be on a leash, not a string.
Sir, you're gonna have to put him down.
He finally caught a squirrel.
Sir, we've had complaints of falling feces
He not in the park, he’s over the park.
He better be housebroken.
Hawkerdoodle?
Try whistling.
Okay, but if he pees on anyone, I'm going to have to issue you a kite-ation.
No, we are not expecting the president's motorcade.
How many times do I have to tell you, dog day afternoons are the last Thursday of the month?
I'm sorry officer.  I see this beautiful woman in the park every day, but I never know how to break the ice.  My mother suggested I get a dog.
His name is Liam. I told him to heel...
Flatulence problems?
That’s a mighty fine tail you have on your kite
I don’t think this is how the space program got the first dog into orbit.
Sir, your dog appears to be high. Please bring him down, I'm going to have to test him for grass.
‘Sir, the Skye Terriers gather over there’
It doesn't hurt him; it's just a little pumping with helium.  The flying is fun and he likes how his bark is like a duck quack now.
So let me get this straight... you’re blind and you’ve filled your dog with helium to look around?
Sorry, but as per the regs, a service animal must demonstrate evidence of special training or skill.
That's no way to treat an emotional support animal!
Sir, you’re disregarding the dog bylaw and the laws of physics.
There have been some complaints that your kite is "marking" the other kites.
Is he always this gassy?
We've been getting complaints he's humping the other kites.
Okay Mr. Potter, you’ve had your fun, but now it’s time to go home.  That’s not even your dog.
I will admit that it's a pretty clever solution to his gas problem.
Don't worry. He'll be down in five farts!
Can your flying dog get this porcupine out of my ass?
"It's a Labrabirdle "
The owner of the 'Two Little Pigs' kite would like a word with you.
Not Funny
Looks like he's higher than a kite.
No, you can’t do it in the dog park either.
Dogs do go to heaven but you have to let go of the string.
Sir, please make sure to pickup your kite's poop.
Only when he's nervous or excited, you say?
No, sir ... the phrase ‘go fly a dog’  isn’t very common in these parts.
But the other kites don't poop on people's heads.
I've had reports of a dog bitting kids helium baloons .. have you seen him?
Sorry, but we only allow service animals in the park.
Fine, but this is the last time.
Well Officer , his name is Kite and...he just loves to fly !
The neighbors are complaining that your kite is shedding.
Sir, I am afraid this is the highest level of  animal abuse .
Mr. Romney, this is the last time I'm going to ask you.
No Officer, I have not seen a dog...
Is that a hot-Airedale balloon?
Yeah, okay ... It’s kind of a leash ... but you still have to clean up after the dog.
Is he cloud broken?
Dog flying is restricted to Truman Park.
I didn't know medical marijuana worked so well.
They have as much right to be here as you do, Sir.
Sir, I told you last week, dog kites on Thursdays only.
So, you think you’re too good for the dog park?
Sorry, but no pooping kites allowed.
Your kite shit on a five year old.
His name better be Roosevelt or we have a problem here.
Is that a service dog?
We have a mission for Laika if you're interested.
I don't care if he's a bird dog, he's still not allowed in the park.
Sir I've warned you about this before"
They said he would be president when dogs fly
You can stay so long as you keep him on string.
Sir, there have been compaints. You need to have waste pickup bags or written proof that he is indeed a pigeon.
Don't be concerned, officer. He thinks he's Snoopy.
If that thing shits, you’re outta here!
The dog kite park is down the block.
Best darn birder you'll ever find!
It's not about the kite.
We’ve had complaints about your dog letting his chips fall where they may.
On behalf of all postal workers, sir. I thank you...
'Sorry, pal. Kites only. You'll have to find another place to walk your Airedale
He's so fly.
Fetching isn't the problem, it's when he drops the ball.
We just ask that you clean up after your pet.
It's the two other things they do that I'm worried about.
Didn't you see the 'No Helium-Filled Dogs Allowed' sign?
Sorry, the rules say 'no dogs,' even if they're on the leash.
Most people just bury ‘em.
Dry kibble will help with the gas.
Very impressive. But I'm afraid you still need to take him to the dog park.
An airdale, I presume.
I know it’s legal now, but you really should keep your dog away from your stash.
We've had complaints about your kite marking its territory.
If he does not go after this ball then he can be considered a kite under the law.
He's had his shots, I don't see what the problem is.
Rescue dog.  Fear of heights.
I don't know whether I should call Animal Control or the FAA.
We're looking for a man who sneaked in a dog.
This is why they're called "Leash laws" and not "Kite string laws."
Excuse me sir, but no dogs are allowed in the air space between 9a and 5p.
It started when he swallowed my granddaughter's, helium balloon"
I don’t care if his breed can do that! You still need to pick up after him.
His name is Kite.
Remove your dog or be ticketed.
Please make sure to curb your kite
Where's the pooper scooper, pal . .  or are you gonna use your hat?
I  don't care if it is an Airdale it is still a dog!
I don't care if his name is Roosevelt.
Well if you see him, call animal control.
We ran out of pigs for Trump's inauguration. This will do for now.
Does your dog there have a medical marijuana card sir?
I hope that kite don't leak.
Because you can't scoop on the fly.
You're gonna have to fly your 'doodle somewhere else.
I’m sure he is having fun but the lady whose head he crapped on isn’t.
Tell me that's not an Airedale
This is a leash!
This is a kite park, sir. The fact that he's an Airedale is irrelevant.
I don't care that she's an Airedale. No dogs allowed.
Pardon me sir... is that an Airedale?
I take it, that's Roosevelt?
That better be an Airedale or you’re in big trouble.
Great. Now there's poo everywhere.
As long as he remains a kite he can stay.
Sir: Once again, I do not care that you are in a Kite park, The NYC health Code does not permit leashes longer than 6 feet long period.
Sir, you're going to need to move downwind.
They're worried a doggie bag will be too little, too late.
Oh, his name is Flydo? Carry on.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask if you are an American citizen.
Can you maybe not feed her beforehand?
Emotional support animals can't fly here.
So explain how Fido got high as a kite.
the dog park is one block south.
I don't care how gassy he is, just pull him in now!!
It's what happens before picking up after your dog that I'm worried about.
It's an Airedale?
Sorry sir but the dog days are over.
I've gotten several complaints of a light drizzle coming from your direction.
Yes, your kite has reached the minimum height and it does indeed have a tail. Problem is, it also has bowels.
He's an airedale, officer.
Sorry, you can’t fly a dog without a license.
So, you’re saying it’s JUST for kites?
You're not fooling anyone...
Remember to pick up after your kite.
Nice try, bud. Leash laws still apply.
Listen, buddy, "Keep off the grass" doesn't exempt you from "No dogs."
I've always liked the songs of free dog kite.
I don't care if his poop 'floats away', you still gotta pick it up.
Airedale terrier?
We had a report of a dog without a license tag.
Sir, the length of your dog leash exceeds the legal limit.  Please lower your dog accordingly.
Kudos getting around the ‘no dogs on the grass’ rule.
It's okay for now, but you can't use him for the kite fighting later.
I saw you with that helium balloon guy. Take the dog down.
Your kite's fine as long as it remains air borne.
Technically you're in violation of the kite tail to body ratio.
No, it is NOT the same as being on a leash.
No problem, sir, as long as he's wearing his leash.
Thank you for leashing your dog, sir.
I don't care if he's an Airedale Terrier. You can't fly him here.
Sir, perhaps an alternative to 'Bombs Away!'
Sorry Sir, but there have been reports that your kite has been threatening the other kites.
The rest of them are leashed, too, but that’s not my point.
Wise guy, huh?
Yes, it rhymes with "Bite Bark" and no that's not close enough.
Is he airbroken?
Sir, please clean up after your kite.
I don't care if he is an Airedale, you're in the wrong park.
...if he comes back, he’s yours; if he doesn’t he never was.
Very clever. You still have to scoop.
Sir, that’s our drug sniffing dog and he’s high on something.
If pigs can fly, so can he!
Sir, I'm from the FAA.  You'll have to reel him in - support animals were banned from this airspace last week
No dogs allowed from the ground up to 25 feet. You're short.
You still have to clean up after it!
Nice Airdale.
Airdales are illegal in this park.
Marjorie wants you and Felicia to come for lunch next Thursday. She’s making cornbread.
Sorry officer, my dog's very light on his feet.
That’s a beautiful German shepbird.
You wouldn’t happen to work at the CRISPR lab?
Didn't you learn your lesson the first time, Mr. Romney?
We both needed some air.
It’s the rule; you catch the stool.
We have received complaints about you kite fighting with the other kites. You will need to muzzle your kite.
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave the park. If we allow dogs to fly here, can pigs be far behind?
So, let me get this straight; your dog's name is Kite?
And, inflating your dog with helium is a separate offense, sir.
I don't care if your dog can fly. Get him down.
Are you aware your service dog is high on the job?
ThePiñata Park is to right
but he is so happy...
You think you're really clever,don't you?
No, sir. I haven't seen "All dogs go to heaven 2"
We're investigating a report of some stolen helium.
It's fine to fly your dog, but you've still got to pick up the poop.
So will he stay floating in the yard or do you have to tie him to a post?
Yeah, his name is Roosevelt.
Just make sure he doesn't mark his territory!
Correct Sir, the code may not fully reflect our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion but he’ll have to relocate to the dog Park nonetheless
You fly him, fine. He flies you, an issue.
New York City leashes must not exceed six feet.
Mr. Romney?
What do you feed her? Mine can't even jump onto the couch.
I don't care how much gas he has, you can't fly him here.
Don't tell me your dog got into your medical marijuana again.
May I also assume that you brought bags with you?
Sir, I'm sorry, but the dog-flying contest is over at TEDDY  Roosevelt Park.
OK it's an Airedale but it's still the wrong park.
There's been a report of illegal kite fighting.
In your case a poop bag is not enough. Do you have your baseball glove?
Next thing ya know it'll be raining kites and dogs.
Everyone’s wondering how you got the helium in.
Recreational helium is still a federal offense.
He is a trained service dog and loves to fly.
I understand dogs are allowed on-leash.
Do you ever take him to the off-leash park?
I guess must have I grabbed the wrong leash.
There have been complaints about sporadic splash downs.
Excuse me sir, this is the ‘If pigs could fly’ park
The Dog Fly is on the other end of the park.
Your kite needs to stop humping other kites.
The dog's fine -- someone complained you're the wrong ethnicity for this park.
You could just take him for a drive on the expressway and let him hang his head out the window.
The Roosevelt park for dogs on meth is across the street.
Sir, you'll need to clean up after your kite.
Sorry, sir, no boxer kites.
Yes, that is amazing, but you are still going to have to scoop.
Uh, sir, the phrase is "when PIGS fly".
Sir, it seems that your kite has not been properly neutered
No, you can't go off-leash here.
Would you consider donating your dog to the police department's drone protection division?
You are barking up the wrong kite!
Would you like your kite fixed?
No, this isn't the Macy's Parade.
It's when pigs fly, sir
Nice try sir, but there are no dogs allowed in the park.
Just be sure to pick up after your kite, Mac.
Sir, I understand your dog identifies as a flying squirrel but he needs to be on the ground when he goes to the bathroom.
But Officer, it’s an emotional support dog!
Two words: kite droppings
You say he's a companion kite and so where is his yellow vest?
Sir, is that your empty Canister of helium in the parking lot.
I told him to 'roll over', and you won't believe what happened next.
Do you know why I pulled you over?
I'm sorry, but your kite does not meet the minimum tail-length requirements."
What happens when fluffy over there finally passes gas?
How did you manage to get him up so high with such a short tail?
Sir! the barking is disturbing the other flyers.
Please bring him down, I'd like to check his tags.
Your kite better be house broken!
Wow, Rex will do just about anything to fit in, eh?
Sorry, sir, you need a leash to fly your dog.
I am sorry sir, but your airedale is not licensed  for this park.
That's not what we meant by pet friendly event
I don’t care if he’s on a leash — we keep getting calls about yellow rain.
Sir, do you have time to talk about our Lord and savior?
My dog had the same problem when we put him on a raw diet.
Sir, your 10 minutes is now finished,
please allow the next person
to use the flying fox.
I want you to know, sir, that I voted for you in 2012.
But officer!  If it flies like a kite, and has a tail like a kite, it’s a kite.
I don't care if he is a skye terrier, bring him down!
I don't care if your dog's name is Roosevelt.
Is that an Airedale terrier?
Don't you think this is a strange hobby for a taxidermist?
A lot of people would reject a dog that identified as a kite.
Is that one of those new Labrokites?
It's okay, sir. I did that to my ex-wife's cat. There is nothing in the books, specifically, about repurposing an animal. Carry on.
No hot doggin.
I'm afraid we no longer allow emotional-support animals.
Yes, officer, this is his leash.
Sorry sir, border collies have recently been added to our no-fly policy
There have been some questions, sir - is she flightbroken?
Curb your enthusiasm.
Your kite just violated the Airborne Particulate Matter Ordinance.
So, you're telling me you know nothing about the dog poop on my hat?
Yes, we're all very impressed you have a trained rat that flies.  But this is  a kite-flying contest.
Again, sir, it's not a 'kite' if you have to force-feed it helium for it to fly.
You're violating the spirit of the leash law.
So, he's an Airedale?
Keep him away from the flying squirrels.
No, seriously, what is wrong with you?
I'm going to need to see his medicinal marijuana card, sir.
Being on-leash and being a kite are distinctly different issues, sir.
I don't care if he is a Skye Terrier--bring him down now!
Sir, I mentioned to you last week that drones and dogs are not allowed here.
https://www.caninejournal.com/dogs-and-marijuana/
You're under a pet.
Sure. "Man kites dog...." Very clever.
It may have a tail, but that doesn't make it a kite.
Tell him to sit.
And then she texted me to ‘go fly a kit.’
Pigs, not dogs.
all dogs go to heaven, unless tied to a string.
Where's your poop drone?
It's actually called 'Downward Dog' and you want the Yoga Park.
Ask him if he can see any illegal immigrants.
What kind of stomach issues?
Balloon clown isn’t pressing charges. Now, about that missing helium tank...
No, Officer, I will NOT put him down.
Aren't you the guy who was pulling a kite on a leash, at the dog park?
I'm not sure of his breed, I got him from the shelter.
It won't work - that's not a pig.
Just be sure to clean up after your "kite".
There have been complaints about the excessive barking.
Very amusing. but can he roll over and play dead?
Sir, your dog is as high as a kite.
Kale, it gives him gas
Did you say it was a shitzu?
Maybe he's a float, but he's not a kite.
Kite Park", "Dog Park", so now the government is telling me what I can bring to the park
That’s very impressive, sir, but you still have to clean up after him.
What other tricks does he do?
I think you want the off-leash park down the road.
No, sir, the fact that he's an Airedale doesn't help.
We have an ordinance against protest kiting.
Im trying, but he doesn't listen to commands.
I'm sorry,sir,but helium-filled dogs are against the rules.
There's laws against feeding helium to vermin.
You have the leash, now you need the plastic bag.
Please pick up after your kite.
‘This is an off-leash dog park.
Airedales only.
Pigs are the only animal allowed to fly here.
Leashes actually aren't required in the kite park
As long as you keep him on a leash...
Well I don't think it was good luck.
Sorry Sir,
Without a diaper, Your kite is in violation of the clean air act
I thought dogs were allowed so long as they are on a leash.
So,What Does the Fox Say?
Yes, I do think that doggie diapers would address all of my concerns.
It doesn't look like a pig to me
...and then she said, yeah right! When dogs fly...
Airedale, Schmerdale. No Dogs means No Dogs.
I admit his acrobatic precision is impressive, but I didn't say clean up your dog's LOOPS.
Let me guess. You're dog's name is Roosevelt?
Sir, just what have you been feeding your dog?
Glad to see you're obeying the leash law sir.
Don't forget to pick up after your kite.
Sir, your leash can be no longer than six feet.
Yes, I have insurance.
I don't care if she is an Airedale, no dogs are allowed in the park.
I don't care if they named the park after him.
Taking the dog days of summer to new heights, are you?
I don't care that he's an Airedale, this park is only for kites.
On leash isn't the issue, sir.
Were you the guy who was walking a kite at the dog park?
Box kites are fine, but boxers are out of the question.
But officer, the sign said 'Dogs allowed on leash.'
I'm going to have to issue you a ticket for violating the laws of gravity.
I'm sure your grandpa was in dogfights as a war pilot too but he describing something completely different to you
I don't care if it's and airedale, it still animal cruelty.
I’m not the owner, just the flyer.
Your kite defecated on a five year old.
Yes, a proper leash is required.
I am sorry sir, only live pigs are allowed to be flown.
You single handedly are responsible for ten new pages in the handbook.
A kite-o-doodle? Seriously?
I told him, 'Look, kites!', but he heard, 'Look, cats!'
I don't care if it is and airedale; no dogs in the park!
I don't know what you did with him but I saw you come in with a dog.
You're telling me your dog at your kite?
If those were raindrops, why don't I see any clouds then?
This isn’t what ‘all dogs go to heaven’ means
It doesn't matter. Last week it was a pig.
I'm sorry, sir, but you must be licensed to fly a dog.
But if your airedale likes to fly, and the lap dogs are running around the track, what are the poodles doing?
ok, but fly him on over the dog park when he needs to                            you -know-what
Well, sir, that all depends on how you define 'kite'
Yes, he's high as a kite, but he's not in fact a kite!
Mr. Romney, we've had some complaints.
It's not the flying. It's the howling.
The "off-leash area" may be a better bet.
What kind of "assist animal" do you call that?
Apparently you haven't read the fine print on our leash law.
Was the dog park that boring?
You're not fooling anyone, mister. There's a dog on the end of that string.   Bring him down now and  get a a license.
You've got to do something about the slobber!
I've heard of bird dogs... just never seen one.
I hear what you're saying, but he's technically not "On the Grass."
I hope you brought a plastic bag.
The leash law specifically says 'attached to collar'"
Well, dispatch called in a 'Kite Biter' so I figured I'd check here first."
The dog days are over, sir. The dog days are done.
We heard that companion dogs are now able to fly free.
That's not quite what we had in mind when we passed the leash law, sir.
Children are crying, Edgar.
Let him go, Sir. If he is truely yours, he will return.
His favorite movie is Up.
He's scouting for a fire hydrant
Sorry officer, he got into the pixie dust again.
Is your Airedale licensed?
Yes,the park rules say you you can walk your fighting dog,or you can fly a fighting kite,but you cannot fly a fighting dog.
It's my new hybreed model.
Sir, is that dog an Airedale?
Excuse me sir, but aerial dogfights are strictly prohibited.
Sorry Sir, but we need that dog on a leash, not a string.
Service animal or not, sir, that dog don't fly here.
I don’t care if you named your dog “Kite”.
I know that he's an Airdale, but that doesn't give you permission to fly that dog here!
I'm a cat person myself.
He was reluctant at first, but know that he has learned to fly, I have to keep him on a short leash
Is that your spirit animal?
Sir, I’m going to have to cite you for dogfighting.
No, I don't believe he is your seeing eye dog.
You realize you'll have to clean up after it.
I know it’s an Airedale, sir, but this park is for kites.
The balloon man is missing his helium tank
He may be on a leash, but clearly he's high as a kite.
You can dogfight, but he has to be muzzled.
The dog park is at the other end of town.  Just thought you might like to know.
You still need to curb your dog, sir.
Either I'm high as a kite... or your dog is.
Our vet prescribed him cannabis oil for his anxiety.
I've heard of Labradoodles and Puggles, but I always thought a Beagle was just a Beagle.
Sir, I’ve told you before - it’s only good luck if a bird does it.
You know the law. Flying dogs need to wear helmets.
I'm more impressed than mad.
Sorry sir, there is no doggy style in this park
Sir, you will have to leave. This is kites for freedom event. The string theory and space alteration conference and faux news events are at the Manhattan Projects.
Remember to clean up after your kite.
Sir, we’ve had several complaints regarding your kite not having been curbed before it was airborne.
They told us the same thing at the dog park.
He found the mushrooms?
I thought it was a dog park and didn't want to disappoint him.
Let me guess, she got into your stash again.
Sir, we’ve had some complaints that your dog has been, shall we say, “letting it fly.”
Please take your kite for a walk.
Yes he flies like an eagle, but we just saw he craps like a seagull... a gross violation of the pet-poop ordinance.
I don't care how many helium balloons your pooch swallowed!  USE THE POOPER SCOOPER or I'm gonna put YOU in a cage!
Makes it tougher to teach him to heel.
I hope you walked him first.
Just tell him to stop singing I Believe I Can Fly.
I guess the Trump baby balloon got stuck at immigration?
Sorry. Yesterday was dog day.
Sorry, but the flying weasel Park is two blocks from here.
I know not to leave him in the car
OK, I get it. The sign says, "No walking dogs in the park.". But we are still concerned about the fallout,
Rufus,
 is just super competitive.
I couldn’t find a flying pig
I don't care if his name is AKITE.....you can't fly him here...
You'll need plastic bags and a baseball mitt to fly your dog here.
A seeing SKY dog?!  Get out of here.
You’ve got to take down your pit balloon. He’s intimidating the other kites.
I'd say you need to balance your dog's diet.
The question now, sir, is whether the dog is walking you.
Just make sure you pick up after him.
This used to be a dog park, we've had to adapt.
We're getting complaints about the droppings.
Lady over there says you got her kite stuck up in a tree.
Gas?
No Sir, New York’s “magic golden rain” is not a thing.
His name is Roosevelt
He ate all your edibles?
What exactly did  you feed him?
No! I do not appreciate your dog-gone joke!
Just stay clear of the empanada truck.
This is not the place to get your dog high."
We had a few complaints from the picnic grounds about scattered showers.
We have an extremely unhappy wedding party downwind from that tree line...
I appreciate Rex is trying to fit in, but it's still our policy. No dogs allowed.
No, it would not be okay if it were alive
I will have to cite you, sir. That leash is far too long
Sir, you'll need to come with me.  Your dog is as high as a kite.
Sir - Airedale ‘s aren’t supposed to be airborne
He's Gassy
I'm guessing the car window isn't cutting it.
I'm sorry sir, only Airedale Terriers are allowed.
Officer, if you are asking where my pig learnt to fly, it was at Hogwarts
We don't supply poop bags so I hope you brought your own.
If pigs could fly, why are you settling for a dog?
I can see he's leashed...You're just lucky I'm off doody.
Excuse me sir, did you happen to see a stray dog run by?
Is that a pig?
I'm responding to a call about animal cruelty, but it looks like it's a little blown up
What? He’s not fond of walks?!…
Sorry, no dogs allowed, including Airedale terriers.
Okay.  Just so we understand, you’ll bring him down when pigs fly.
Reel!
A woman complained that you didn't pick up after him and it ruined her hair.
And what made you think this was a good idea?
Sir, that is not a pig.
I don't care if he has gas!
I don't know how you did it, but you have to bring him down.
I just like to remind people that taxidermy can be fun.
Sir, the saying is when pigs fly.
No, I haven't seen your cat.
Sir, I don't care that his name is Roosevelt.
The novelty wore off when that dog started pooping.
Yes, it's an off-leash park. But I wouldn't recommend it.
"I'd like to see, both your dog's and your license sir. We've been getting complaints of 'canine droppings'  falling on  cars parked here in our lot."
Sir, the Ki-O-Te park is down the street.
He's as high as a kite - bring that dog down.
House trained and parked trained are not the same thing .
Either that's a kite looks like a dog or we got a problem.
No, it doesn't matter that it's your emotional support animal.
Sir, no dog flyers are permitted in this park.
I'm afraid you're going to have to take your kite down or else risk being sued for libel by President Trump."
Nice try pal. The dog park is two blocks over.
Sorry. Even with this training, we still can't let your emotional support animal pilot the plane.
Sir, you will have to come with me. You are attacking the laws of gravity.
Bowser may have gas but that does not qualify him as a kite.
Well, if you can teach him to fly, it shouldn't be that hard to teach him not to pee while he's up there!
Ok, look, here's the deal. Technically, he's now a bird, so if he poops, I don't have to clean it up.
Sir, I'm afraid you'll need to take that back to the barking lot.
Is that a new breed of Airedale?
Sir, this is an off-leash park.
The Dump Trump Dog Park is on Pensylvania Avenue
I can see he's leashed; it's the droppings I'm worried about.
Sir, for the last time, please stop inflating your dog!
The others are potty trained.
Nice try Martin. The “No Dogs Allowed” sign still applies.
Just because it can fart and fly does not mean it is a kite.
Excuse me sir, no dogs are allowed.
Nice try. As soon as soon as he hits the ground you’re getting a ticket
Aren’t you a little old to believe in flying rats?
He may well have gone before launch, but I'm not willing to take that chance.
Watchdogs are only allowed at Nixon Kite Park.
I don't care if it's name is Roosevelt, you can't fly your dog here!
Your leash is longer than six feet.
I'm sorry sir, this is an off-leash area.
Sir, I'd need you to put it down.
You couldn’t have at least neutered him first?
I don't CARE if your dog IS named Roosevelt...
It is ok officer he thinks he is a pig
Did I feel a raindrop?
You are a sick puppy.
Wolf in Kite's Clothing.
He's as high as a kite, sir, so it's painfully clear that you have NOT been keeping him off of the grass!
I don't care how strong the wind is; the dog park is over there.
Sir, I need you to move your illegally parked helium truck.
But officer I'm not walking the dog
I'm afraid, sir, your leash is much too loose.
Delusions of grandeur?
Good buoy!
I hope he went before he came.
But he is on a leash.
I don't care if FDR did have a dog, you can't fly dogs in the Kite Park!
Empty your pockets. Your dog is higher than a kite.
adfsafdadfsd
Be sure to pick up after your kite.
It’s easy.  First I reverse the vacuum cleaner hose.............
Sorry, airedales don't qualify.
He’s an Airedale’s you know.
Constipated?
I don't care if you filled him with helium, this park is for kites only.
It's ok; he's an Airdale.
Sir, would you mind holding this string?  I got to go take a leak.
You read the sign. That's no pig.
Sir, I need to ask you to keep your dog on a shorter leash.
For the last time, stop shouting "Yabbidi dabbidi do" . It isn't even a bear.
Airedales must be grounded in the park.
It’s always refreshing to find someone else who recycles and reuses.
Sir, the ordinance clearly states that leashes must not exceed 8 feet.
Sir, you are allowed to off-leash your pet during these hours.
You will have to leave sir--that is not rain!
Good try with the helium sir, but you must move to the dog park.
I used to be a helium salesman. He's my emotional support service dog.
We've had a few complaints about dog droppings.
He's fine officer - his bark is worse than his flight.
When I graduated from dogcatcher school, they gave everyone a comically oversized butterfly net. "Why would I ever need *this* thing," I said.
Well, he flies as high as a kite.
But it is a leash!
No sir, a string is NOT a leash.
Isn’t it a little hot to be wearing a jacket, sir?
Catch anything'
Is he part airedale?
At least it keeps him from chasing squirrels.
It's okay if you can document that it is an emotional support animal.
Irrefutable proof? No. What I do have is poo on my hat.
I see your Lab's met his diet goal."
No. And you can't walk your kite here, either.
I don’t care if his name is Teddy.
We don't let kites in the dog park either.
I’m sorry. But I’ve been delegated to this stupid New Yorker cartoon contest and I’’m supposed to ask you why your kite is so unconventional.
If you would please stop challenging people to a "dog fight" we'd really appreciate it.
Sorry, Sir.  No dogs above four feet!
OK - They're the same family, but it's not a flying squirrel
The dog is fine but you didn't clean up your helium canisters.
No, I'm not interested in how you train your bird dogs. I'd like to ask you a couple questions about a missing helium tank...
Tethered and leashed are not the same thing.
No flying dogs without a diaper.  Period.
Sir, it’s starting to sprinkle.
Of course, you are complying with our leash law, however, it is your failure to obey the pick up after your pet law that has everyone concerned.
Is this some sort of protest?
And did you bring an umbrella for everyone?
For the last time...NO dogs allowed in the park!
You are attached to that? Just let it go.
It's for bulls, moose, and kites only.
No, that doesn't count as being on leash.
Sorry officer, I can't hear you over this howling wind.
Final warning about the tail biting, Henry.
You could be the best K9 trainer this force has ever seen.
The Dog Park is around the corner.
This park is only for Kites!
The dog park was too crowded.
I don't see your plastic bags, sir. Or your catchers mitt.
I think you'd be better off at the dog park
I don't care if he is an airedale.  Get him down.
Sir, if that's not a certified service dog, you'll have to remove it from the kite park.
Eleanor would not be amused.
Sir, please curb your dog before there is an unfortunate accident.
you are OK but don't bring that Trump blimp here again!
Sir. Pigeons are bad enough. Did you walk him first?
I think we can both agree my dog is above the leash law
Sir you can't fly dogs here."
park official
"I know I didn't think I could either!"
man
Sorry,high string dogs not allowed.
Sir, your dog is not a kite!
OK, I'll let it go this time because he's on a leash.  But you've got to clean up after him.
No, a string is not a leash.
I do hope your kite is housebroken"
Sir, we removed all of the flying squirrels from the park last week.
Mind helping me catch a flying squirrel?
No dogs. Even on a leash.
The canine my friend is blowing in the wind, the canine is blowing in the wind.
You bet I'm bird-dogging you.
Does your dog have a license to fly
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn network
Sorry, no dog flighting allowed.
Sir, do I have to remind you again?
It's okay, just keep him on the leash.
OK, I'll admit his bird hunting skills is next level, but you'll still have to pick up after him..
Sorry sir, it doesn’t matter if his feet are not on the ground, the leash cannot be longer than 6 feet
I suggest you change your dog's diet away from beans.
I captured Underdog, I trained Underdog.  He was a friend of mine.  Sir, that is no Underdog.
Are you telling me your dog is high as a kite?
You two mastered fetch?
I see he's back on a low carb diet.
You're okay as long as you keep your kite on the leash.
No sir, the forecast for today is not cloudy with a chance of milk bones.
Look sir, I've never heard of a Guatemalan flying retriever...I order you to land him immediately.
Sir, it's no longer a dog park.
I'm sorry sir.  You'll still need a scooper.
She watched All Dogs Go to Heaven. But it's not her time.
Well because Sir, kites don’t poop.
Sure he loves it. But is he potty trained?
We need more like you.
Don't think you're the first one pulling this off.
I hope for your sake that your bark is worse than your kite.
You see, not all dogs go to heaven!
That's great: he flies. Ya still gotta pick up his poop.
That's one of the disadvantages of owning an Airedale.
I don’t care if she’s an airedale, sir.
Sir, I believe your have your dog high on something.
This is not my dog!
I wouldn't send a dog out on a kite like this!
You seem like you would benefit from a review of the leash laws in certain areas of the community.
He got into my edibles.
Pomeravian?
His bark is worse than his flight!
Sure, but can she sit?
Dog parks are for sissies.
Not just animal control. I can't even count how many FAA regulations you're breaking.
Sir, you're gonna have to curb your lighter-than-airedale.
I suppose you have a drone poop bag as well?
I understand it has a tail but it's not a kite.
And how, exactly, will you curb your dog?
If he exhales, you're toast.
Remember - the 'bag it' policy still applies.
What do you mean, “that’s not a kite”?
Don't fly him over anyone.
Good morning, Mr. Romney.
Sir, please pick up after your dog.
It's still No Dogs in this area ...
A tethered Airedale drone does not qualify as a kite.
He's half-terrier, half-helium.
No it does not count as a leash and  yes it is going to cost you 35 bucks.
Sorry, sir. A kite string isn't the same as a dog leash.
Sir, it really doesn't matter if his name is Skye...
Sir, Mr. Wonka would like to have a word.
Just be careful he doesn't slip the leash.
You know we lost Benji that way.
You can't fly your dog in here buddy, you know that
License and registration please.
You need to diaper your kite.
I'm afraid of kites.
That's a bit ruff for this park.
Your ‘toxonomic dilemma’ aside, I say if it poops it belongs in the dog park.
The wind howls at Kite Park even without your help, mister.
It's okay officer. I'm flying with a service dog.
Yea, she’s an Airedale...
I advise you to reduce the cannabis snacks.
When you come to the end of your leash, tie a knot and hang on.
Or maybe just crack the widow when you drive
No more Trump kites -- period.
No, this area is for kites, its not a dog run.
Be sure to pick up after your kite, sir.
We've had some rather specific complaints from people on the ground.
'When dogs fly'  is just a distorted expression, sir.
Sorry, but I can't let you have a dog in this flight.
It's OK - he's a Skye Terrier!
Sir, that is not the proper way to keep your dog on a leash here.
Sorry, guidelines call for a 2-foot tail that curls gently in the wind.
Sir, I don't know what an "Underdog" is but its scaring the children.
Kite" is a subjective term, don't you think
I don't care if she's an Airedale, you have to take her to the dog park.
Well, I guess your dog is technically on a leash.
He has to stop marking the other kites with his scent.
Sir I have good news. We found your cat.
I don’t care if the people at the dog park thought he’d be more comfortable here.
Hey Buddy, Don't try to impress me!  You should've seen the pterodactyl that was here last week.
We don't allow gas operated kites in this park.
If we make an exception for you, we'll have to make it for everyone.
Sir, the dog park is two blocks east.
Sir, I said curb your dog. C-U-R-B.
No nude kites.
Is that a kite or a helium sniffer dog?
Sir, this is not a pet-free zone.
He dreamt he could fly--and voila!?
I don't care if your Airedale's named named after 2 former presidents, you, and he, cannot consume marijuana edibles in the park.
This is the last time I am going to warn you about getting that dog high!
Is he Kite Park trained?
His name is Washington, I didn't think anyone would notice
I'm sorry, sir, it's not the dog itself that's the issue. It's just ... cleaning up after him can become quite messy.
I understand how important the tail is, but...
But sir, my dog enjoys getting high.
Good looking Airedale.
Dog poop, officer? I don't even have a dog.
This isn't what I meant when I said that you have to use a leash here.
What do you mean ‘If pigs could fly’?
Sir,  your kite has the wrong kind of tail.
I’m afraid a kite tether still doesn’t qualify as a leash, sir.
I was born female, so I can relate.
Sir please move to the designated dog flying area of the park.
Your dog still needs to be on a leash.
Too small for the Macy’s parade?
I am a kiting specialist, usually checks, but trying dogs today. Gotta problem with that?
I get bloated after Mexican.
Sir, you'll have to come back during off-leash hours.
Nice hat.
I'll be impressed when it's a pig.
Your kite's tail is the best out here.
You might have a chance if it was a teddy bear.
You can fly him here, but you'll have to land in the dog park.
Sorry - no balloon animals.
It’s a Trump Baloon...
Emotional support animals are not allowed to fly here.
Filling your dog with helium, is considered animal cruelty, regardless of his preference to fly.
I say it’s a dog . . . and that's no leash.
Airedale, Schmairedale, get it down!!
It's "if pigs could fly."
It's actually rabbit season.
No Airedales allowed.
And what sort of drugs did the dog take, sir?
Sir, the tail of your kite is not the regulated length.
No sir, that was not rain.
And you'll have to pay for my hat to be dry cleaned, sir.
No flying dogs.  Really annoys the flying squirrels.
I thought Retrievers were afraid of heights.
Sir, we don;t approve of you making mockery of the president that way!!
This isn’t Dog Day Afternoon.
As they always say, it’s not the dog in the kite, it’s the kite in the dog.
Why not? I thouvgh only pigs can't fly.
Look out! He's about to take his 9:30...
While there's no specific code violation, I simply can't not write you up.
It's flying kites and dogs.
But the pet shop told me he's an Airedale!
The expression is 'When pigs fly', not 'When dogs fly'.
Cheddar jump! Cheddar stay!
You might want stop feeding your dog so many beans.
Um, sir. I know they say 'whatever flies your kite'...
I’m sorry Sir, but a leash is not allowed to exceed a length of 5 feet.
Sir, you’re going to have but keep that kite  on a tighter leash.
I used an airhose.
Don't worry. He did his business before takeoff.
Is that a rescue kite?
If that's the case, I'll need to see the emotional
support animal documentation.
Do you smell updog?
You're under arrest for feeding cannabis to a dog.
What else can you train your dog to fetch?
What's the dog's name?
CGI.
Full moon tonight?
\                                                                                      he is too a kite.                                                                                   see his tail."
Sir,you must keep your dog on a 6 foot leash
I don't care how high he is, you're a terrible man.
You know helium will make his bark high-pitched, right?
You'll have to leave the park sir. We've received a stalking complaint from a Miss Red Riding Hood in Apt. 5B.
His name is Sam, he is a therapy dog and usually flies a couple of times a week.
Well, he's pretty gassy. Are you sure you want me to bring him down?
Almost perfect - it just needs a longer tail.
Well then, I guess you're going to have to LEARN how to clean up after your kite, sir.
AKC does NOT stand for American Kite Competition.
Don't forget to clean up after him.
Ah, he was always full of hot air.
So I'm guessing he got into your medical marijuana.
Sir, You need a Permit to fly That.
Just don’t make him fetch anything.
Please tell me your kite is housebroken.
Sorry, but you need a permit to let your freak flag fly.
Holy Cow”, if she drops any meadow muffins, your responsible
I would suggest a lighter dog.
I'm afraid my reading of the leash law is not that open minded.
Sorry, this is a State Park.  No dogs allowed.
I bet you've still never seen an elephant fly.
Cloud-broken, eh?
I don't care if he is a Chinook. The dog park is on 20th.
"Please make sure you keep your dog on-leash; last week we had a Shih Tzu end up in Albany "
Let me guess,ever since winning Best In Show,he has been high as a kite?
Good thing you didn’t dock the tail.
You're making the other dogs insecure.
Why don't you go fly a kite?
When pigs fly, sir.
I'm not sure that qualifies as a properly leashed dog.
You're lucky the leash law is vague, sir.
PETA be damned!
Seriously?!
Well, as usual, everything's up in the air.
But it's on a leash, what's your problem?
You know it's not a kite, right?
Harry, you may be a Roosevelt, but that still doesn’t make your dog a kite”
Filling your dog with helium does not make him a kite.
Sir, the flying rat park is down the street.
And how do you propose cleaning up after him?
It's more of a hygiene hazard...
US citizen?  And where was your dog born?
Without the leash, he’d be chasing flying squirrels.
He had lots of wind today
Die Fledermaus nicht gewart
I was surprised too
Sorry sir, underdogs are not allowed in this park!
As long as he eases up on the other tails it’s all good.
You do realize that there is a dog park right down the street.
I think you were supposed to take it seriously but not literally.
Well, after he was hit by a car, he died in his dog house. A few days later he bloated up and started floating around in there. I decided to take him for our weekly walk to the park, and here we are.
I thought Teddy would approve.
Sir, you know the park rules.  You have to provide umbrellas.
Akita is not a kite.
This is a park for kites, not flying dogs, but if he takes a dump on the Trump hotel over there you’re good.
Yes sir, but you still need to pick up after him.
Tags and collar required.
Doggone it, Bill! I thought we talked about this.
You have to clean up after your kite
Yes, I see he's on a leash but dogs are still not allowed in the park.
How far is Canada ?
Sir, that dog needs to come with me, he's high as a kite!
What do you mean he tried to convert to Pigeon?
I don’t care how fast it can flap its legs, it still can’t fly here.
Try a grain-free diet.
You try saying no to those puppy dog eyes
A taxidermy coyote filled with helium is not a kite.
Just as I thought, he doesn't have an ounce of herding instinct.
Listen, buddy, you better have taken him first to the 'Dog Walk.'
Your kite just pooped on me.
I know! And they told me he was an old dog when I got him.
Are you prepared to clean up after your kite?
SORRY SIR: NO ANIMALS ALLOWED
The Airedale park is on the other side of town
Was the dog park full?
I don't care if it's name is Franklin, Teddy, or Eleanor. No dogs in the park means no dogs.
A hat was a great call today.
Dogs should never eat at Taco Bell.
Sir, a kite string does not count as a leash.
Kites or pigs. No dogs.
Best damn fetching I've ever seen!
in Russian that's : летающая крыса собака

letayushchaya krysa sobaka
No, he's fine as long as the wind is howling.
It wasn't easy filling him with helium
Yeah, he liked chasing birds. So I figured what the heck.
You better believe you still gotta clean up after him.
Look pal, I don’t WRITE the bylaws.
She’s a rescue — we’re working up to the dog park.
I bet you think you're funny.
They kickerd me out of the dog park too.
I understand the dog park is full, sir, but you'll have to bring him down now.
Did you miss the memo? This is an undercover operation. Walk away rookie.
That better be an Airedale terrier or you're looking at a $200 fine.
Sorry Officer, I thought that this was the dog park.
Take your dog to the designated flying area.
I DON'T CARE IF IT IS THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER, THAT IS ONE WEIRD KITE.
More fake Gnus
If I let you wear a cap, then everyone will want to wear a cap.
Sir, if that's not an airedale, you've got some explaining to do.
No sir, you're fine, I'm just wondering how you trained him to do that?
I don’t care if you call that a leash, this still is not a dog park.
Your kite bit me.
Is it an Airdale?
First, What is it? and Second, Why??
The deplorables are saluting, sir!
He'll only be up there for a minute. He really hates to lose a tennis ball.
No ball playing.
Where's your plastic bag?
Is that your asphalt roller parked out front?
Sir, you can't be in here without a kite.
Not enough gas to fill up the Trump baby?
Sir, this is not the dog park.  Your Airdale is not permitted to chase tail or make it rain on the other parkgoers.
Sir, the doggie play area you were looking for - our BITE park  - is just down the road.
I think you may have the wrong park, sir.
Please clean up aft your dog.
So the squirrel kite people just approached me....again.
Do your dog a favor and stop treating him to carbonated beverages.
Sir... 
Did you pre-poop your dog?
Eleanor says Dog Days are over.  We have a New Deal.
Sorry officer, this is the closest we get to a walk after he got into the Catnip
The taxidermist said it would be okay
July’s contest for the highest dogs is actually at Coney Island.
I don't care that he's named Ben Franklin.
A tail does not make a kite."
As impressive as that is, it's technically still a dog and not allowed.
Please curb your kite.
I am a little concerned about fallout.
...my dog’s name is “Kite,” so...
Just make sure you keep your pooper scooper with you at all times.
Okay buddy, Letterman wants his helium tank back.
Do me a favor and fly him over the receptacle, 'kay?
Dog kites are required to have a tail two/thirds the length of the animal’s body.
Sir, there are no pets allowed
Woah, dude, nice.
If that kite lifts its leg ...
I thought I’d float the idea of giant rats for pets.
I've just been struck with a great name for a Brewery."
Really? The FAA and SPCA have a joint task force?
Have you considered his feelings about flying?
Sir, I'm sorry, but he's going to need a longer tail.
“The rules are clear; all animals must be on a leash in the park.  That is not a leash.”
Did you bring a Baggie with you?
I'm calling it in, we've got a K9 on cloud 9.
Technically it is a leash, yes, But some picnickers downwind are complaining, sir.
I'm sorry sir, but no kiteyotes are permitted in this park.
Unless your dog has been potty-trained, you can't fly it here."
Sure, bird dogs are fun until you've got to scoop the poop off of somebody's head.
You can only  fly that in the Wall Street kite park.
Can you read THAT sign?
But officer, I AM keeping him on a leash!
Sir, pumping up your dog with helium is a no-no, and yes I know this used to be the Dog Park!
Sir, I don’t think this is protected by the first amendment
I’m not sure I’d call that ‘wagging,’ sir,
In your case, Sir, the sky's the limit and you've already exceeded it!
I don't care what you say your dog ate.  This is not a dog park.
Fines for airborne dog poop are double.
Is that one of those heliodoodles? My wife's been wanting one but we're concerned about the high ceilings.
Those new helium dog biscuits, eh?
We enjoy variety here, mister, but we draw the line at roadkill designs.
You can't fly a bloated dog here until after 5 PM
We don’t allow droppings in this park ya know...
I'm sorry, Sir. We couldn't find the ball.
Is it the helium that causes that weird bark?
Sir, we have a strict no Airedale policy.
Sir, you really need to curb your dog.
Technically, he's still in the park.
I thought the sign meant no dogs allowed on the ground.
Sir this is the Right hand Kite Park. The Left hand Kite Park is over the hill.
OK buddy,what's your tale
Sir, a kite string is not a leash.
I'm surprised he doesn't have more volatile instability with such a short tail.
Next time, you might want to bring an umbrella.
I’m from the ASPCA, and I need to speak to you.
Still, it's not a leash.
Nice try Timmy
Obedience training is at Washington Park today.
Your kite will have to submit to a breathalyzer.
People are complaining.  Put a diaper on him.
Will it still soar if it farts?
I'm sorry, but your dog needs to be on a leash.
Oh, he just counter surfed the baked beans again.
As long as you catch it before it hits soneone!
Sorry, sir. Cats only.
Is your Airedale registered?
We were just going for a run, but didn't anticipate the excellent wind conditions
It’s great at retrieving, I don’t even have to shoot a bird.
Did you see the "You must pick up after your pet"  sign?
And I suppose you’re going to make me clean up after the birds now, too?
I'm the Kite Park Theme Officer.  Animal themes are scheduled for tomorrow.
Sir, I hope your kite is potty-trained.
That's some leash.
Sir,  the  canister of helium must be recycled.
Sorry, Sir, no dogs allowed over the park !
What did you expect? He is an Airedale.
Regardless, you still have to pick up after him.
What? His name is Kite.
His mother was a zeppelin retriever.
Sir, helium filled pet day is tomorrow.
Not FDR, Teddy. And that isn't a kite either.
Whatever floats your goat.
Does he retrieve runaway kites?
No service dogs allowed.
Unfortunately, this will make it a lot more complicated to clean up after him
I know there is no "Curb Your Kite" sign but people are complaining.
I told you before no dogs in the park, that goes even if the balloon man did help you out.
You're still responsible for cleaning up after your dog, including any collateral damage.
Is he a registered Skye Terrier?
I don't care if he's on his leash. No dogs allowed in this park.
I realize he's not "technically" in the park, but I'll still need to see his license
As long as it keeps flying I won't cite you for illegal dog walking.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to fly your dog elsewhere.
Yes, I know what an Airedale is.
Stay away from the trees.
I'm sick and tired of people acting like their pets are above the law"
Sir, I just think it's somewhat morbid.
sorry sir, but airdales are to be in the dog park.
Always kick a dog when it's up.
I need to see your license and registration please
The hardest part was getting him to swallow the helium.
I'm sorry sir, dogs are not allowed in this park.
Fine, call PETA, but he's a bird dog and he loves it...
Sir, please make sure you clean up after your kite
Is your dog's license current?
Dog days ended last week, sir.
If you think this exempts you from curbing your dog, you are sadly mistaken.
All leash laws apply plus dry cleaning expense for overhead soiling.
Is this for your Youtube channel or something?
He gets a little gassy sometimes and this is the best solution.
Thank you for keeping your dog on a leash sir.
Sir, I just need to see your permit
I don’t care if your dog’s name is Kite
I don't care if his name is "Roosevelt:" if you gonna fly him, he's gonna need a diaper.
The S.P.C.A. would like you to take it down."
It's your doody to scoop the poop.
Not a dog, it’s a fox.
It's my feeling that dog people and kite people should be able to get along.
Helium filled animals are against the rules."
'that thing poops on anybody, you're toast"
You failed to pick up after your kite.
Pigs can fly here but dogs are strictly forbidden.
Rainapoo?  Is that a new breed?
Sir, you’ll have to curb your dog.
We tried to go to the dog park. Some bitch kept barking at us.
And I assume he's had an airborne flu shot?
I had it custom made.
That's fine, sir, but you'll still need to clean up after him.
Excuse me, sir, but your kite just peed on me
Flying squirrels have to go to Bullwinkle Park.
Do you have a permit for that?
That doesn’t qualify as a leash.
Your dog is required to be on a secure leash. String doesn't count.
You can't hunt flying squirrels here. That's the park over.
Chinese fighting kites don’t include shar-peis, sir.
‘I’m sorry sir, but you’re either going to have to take your hawkapoo to the dog park or to the bird sanctuary.’
Where is BABY TRUMP???
Hey buddy, just want you to know my I bet my hairy ass that thing wouldn't fly. Thanks a lot!
Sir, please curb your dog before you fly him!
You realize your dog doesn't have nine lives.
Technologically he is on a leash.
Yes sir, the park will in fact be renamed “Trump Kite Park,” but the official renaming will take place after the new drill sites are all open and operational. Thanks for using your Parks pass and enjoy your day.
Sir, you might feel more comfortable if you took him to the dog park.
You gonna clean up after your kite?
next time bring a pooper-scooper.
I'm sure he IS friendly sir but that's not really the issue
Just be careful, now. That dog gas is powerful stuff.
Can I see your dog flying license?
Hello. Sorry to bother you but we have a leashed dog policy and, well, we’re not sure this qualifies.
I'm sorry, sir, but dog's must be on a leash.
There's always one person who just has to fly their dog.
That's quite s trick you've taught your Airdale?
Next time, skip the baked beans.
I'm sorry, this isn't a dog friendly park.
He's always thought of himself as a bird not a dog
Sorry Officer, how do you expect me to curb him?
When the boss tells you to go fly a kite, you don't need to take it literally.
No Frisbees, sir.
Dog's gotta hunt
So, he got into your medical marijuana!
I thought you were the one that was full of hot air!
So he was acting high as a kite?  That won't cut it, sir.
I don't care how rare Scottish Birdoodles are, you still need a permit.
People were staring at the dog park, too
No blimps allowed
Nice try, pal.
This isn't London you know!
Do you have a license for that Airedale?
Sorry Benjamin, Franklin can't fly here.
No, Twitter Man, Master of Confrontational Pedantry, I don’t see how the ‘imprecise’ wording and logic of our ‘no flying dogs in the kite park’ policy could be used by a liberal government to invoke Sharia law. Please leave.
I don't care, you still have to pick up after him.
I don't care what your problem is.. we simply don't allow therapy kites in our park !
Whata ya mean he just got away?
"We have an FDR at this park, sir: Flying Dog Restriction."
I need to see your pilot's license before you can fly your pet.
Sorry, no dogs allowed in the park.
This must be the "updog" everyone's talking about.
Yes, pooper scooper laws still apply.
I never heard of a dog having gas problems before.
Sir, I understand the dog park is overcrowded, but I hope for your sake you brought an umbrella.
my dog just chases cars
Nope.  There are no Airedale waivers.
As long as he's on a leash, I don't really have a problem with it.
Falas are only allowed off leash sir.
He hates car rides.
There are several windshields in the parking lot which you'll need to clean.
You're making the others nervous.  Does your dog bite?
I presume he took care of business before he went up?
No one else's kite seems to leave droppings.
No, sir. Not even Airedales!
They want you to put of diaper on your birddog or fly him elsewhere.
You realize there is no peeing in flight.
Sorry sir, helium-filled pets are not allowed.
Flying dogs must be equipped with diapers.
Whaddaya mean, he's a rescue?
He's barking up the wrong tree.
Sir, we have a 'No Dogs Allowed" policy. But may I say, yours was a damn good try!
As a member of PETA, I'm object to this conduct. But as a member of law enforcement, I can't do anything about it because your animal is technically leashed.
The FAA wants to know if he's friendly.
He may look like a dog, but inside he feels like a bird.
I will have you know that this he was assigned to the U.S. Army Airborne Division before being decommisioned.
His bark is worse as a kite.
Walking or flying it doesn’t matter you still have to pick up the poop!!
As long as his 'business' goes up too, we're cool.
Kite license, please.
That’s a fine “up”, sir, now try “heel.”
OK, they all have tails. But what about the barking and leg-flapping?
Sir, we have you on video feeding that dog beans...bad boy...bad boy...
I'm sorry...a doggie bag is not enough. 
I'll need to see an umbrella as well!
What's below the tail is causing the complaint.
It's only illegal depending on which hole you used to blow it up.
I promised that after I packed his bags, pre-flight, zero hour, 9 a.m., that he'd be high as a kite by then.
The dog park was closed.
Sir, while you are not technically "walking" your dog, you still need to clean-up after him.
No, I'm afraid kites don't count as big sticks, sir.
Why? Because everyone will be upset if he has to relieve himself!
Yes, it is leashed, but...
I'd like to talk to you about our new Kite-9 initiative
He got into my stash Sir!!
You hear that high-pitched barking? When it turns into a deep growl, watch out below.
He's just like a bumble bee. I didn't tell him he could fly, so he did.
The dog park is two blocks west.
No, and you can't let your kite run around on the grass in the dog park, either.
I knew I would find you here...I give up being your milkman...once again no bottles left on your step!
I don't care if he's an airedale, he's still a dog and dogs aren't allowed in the park.
Sorry, your tail doesn't meet 
 specifications.
Sir, kites are not allowed to bark in this park.
Exuse me sir, but all forms of duck hunting are prohibited here.
Man, that's messed up, you need to stop.
I don't care if you are looking for your car - you're only allowed a six-foot leash, max!
Okay, as long as he stays on the leash.
I figured this was safer than letting him fly commercial.
I'm sorry, no pets in the park, sir.
We have a dog run down the way if she’d like a chance to be off the leash...
No, I said I'd believe it when pigs fly.
The dog park is over the hill.
He confuses “cats” for “kites.” We’re seeing a specialist.
You do know that being “high as a kite” is not the same thing as being a kite, right?
What do you mean you're just flying the dog?
Helium dogs must be kept on a leash.
When they're on a leash, they're allowed to walk on the ground.
He used to work for the DEA.”
If that were an elephant, you'd be out of here!
You actually want me to believe rain drops can be yellow?
Do you have  a doggie  bag?
You'll have to bring him down, if he's not house-trained.
I just need to make sure neither of you is higher than a kite.
Your animal is supposed to be on a leash and that little string doesn't count.
I don't care if his name is Fala. No dogs allowed
Officer, I granted his wish to be higher than a kite.
You're scaring the kids
Legalized pot has her high as a kite.
Excuse me, sir, but the Salvador Dogí Park is down the street.
I don’t care if he’s enjoying himself sir, it’s still no dogs in park.
I’m sorry, sir. Your leash exceeds the ten feet limit.
Dog flying is only allowed over in Sheep Meadow.
You caught me. It a Samoyed kite, and I’m passing signals to my Russian comrades across the river at the UN.
I don't care if he's descended from Fala. No dogs allowed in the park.
Why are you so determined to make it rain kites and dogs?
Whatever it is, just make sure you clean up after it.
NASA called and said, they want their dog back.
Sir, please be sure to clean up after your dog.
FDR had Fala, so what?
Is that an Up-In-The-Airedale Terrier?
It can't be a boxer with a tail like that.
I told you not to bring your dog in the park.
It doesn't matter, his leash still can't be more than 6 feet.
I'm from the ASPCA and I don't care how happy he looks.
You still have to pick up after your pet, sir.
Doggie diapers are required.
Is your name Clark Griswold?
Yes, but he is still on a leash.
The dog kite park is on Jefferson Street
Excuse me, sir.  About your dog being high as a kite...
I believe what you were thinking of was “pigs”
Sorry pal, read the rules — no taxidermists at DIY Kite Day.
You’re going to have to take it down. Only pigs fly here.
Last warning.  Tell him, 'Down boy, down.'
You can't feed the animals, you can't touch the animals, and you certainly can't fly them around in a kite park.
Sir, I’ve seen Fala and that is no Fala. (So please dont fala us here again)
Are there beans in your brand of dogfood?
His tail light is out?
Sir, you’ll need a muzzle to fly him here ..
Too cheap to buy a kite?
We do allow pigs, 'cause I mean who doesn't want to see pigs  fly, but dogs, that is a big no no in these parts, Mister.
Sir, could you please curb your dog?
Mine's afraid of the car.
Excuse me Sir,did you say,"he just doesn't fit in at the Dog park".
A helium filled wolf does NOT qualify for this kite fight!
Filling your dog with helium again, Wilbur?
Just so you know, it's okay to let him off the leash.
I guess pigs are not the only ones that fly
That doesn't excuse you from the leash law, sir.
Anything can fly if you fill it with enough helium
Sir, no dogs are allowed in the kite park--not even bird dogs.
At least he doesn’t think he’s a yo-yo anymore. That was a lot of cleanup.
Have you heard?  INFLATABLE SQUIRREL CARCASS is playing the bandshell.  Bet your kite would enjoy it.
Dog flights are illegal in this state.
Sir, this is a kite competition and not a dog show.
I have to issue a summons for not cleaning up after your kite.
I don't give a rat's ass what the sign back there says
Excuse me, but the dog park is down the road a quarter mile.
Listen buddy, I'm not going to tell you again. This is not the dog park.
I told my grandson before the election, Trump will be president when dogs fly.
Sir, you still need a poop bag.
I'm sorry, sir, that's inappropriate.  Let her go.
Tell him nice try, but we know he knocked over the ice cream cart
Sir, no flying dogs past 9am in the park.
A dirigi-bulldog?  Nice try.  You'll need to float him over to the dog park.
What's the problem, Officer? He's training to be lunar Rover"

-Peter and Eliza Lewine, New Orleans, L
We've had reports of a kite urinating on other kites.
You'll need a long handled pooper scooper to fly that here.
Still swallowing balloons, eh?
Gotcha, if he’s Under Dog where’s his cape?
I know you got asked to leave the dog park because of his bad gas, but you can't be here either.
It’s tie me kangaroo down, mate. Not up.
Changed dog food brands again?
You have to pick up after your kite.
Officer, I swear - I'm clean,it's my dog that's high as a kite.
Sir, I don't care if he likes it.
If your  weren’t my brother, I’d report you to P.E.T. A..
City Ordinance #3647 specifies that dogs must be restrained by handheld leashes no longer than eight feet in length.
Nice try, but leash laws are leash laws
I need to ask you a few things about your visit to the park zoo.
Just remember to pick up after your kite, sir.
Wait here while we write an ordinance.
To get him back try saying 'Heel, Liam'.
Officer,  the former owner was a yoga master. This seems to be the transition  from downward
facing dog to upward facing dog.                  .
Kite Runner. Eh?
Allegations, that's all they were.
I don't like the way he's raising his right rear leg.
Please curb your dog.
Wow -- that takes loyalty at a whole new level.
We’ve had some complaints about you not picking up after your dog.
Sir, flying your dog is strictly prohibited in this section of the park.  You want to go just past the trees there.
The Hoover dog park sucks.
Don't tell me - he's a seeing-eye dog and you're just looking.
You will still have to clean up after him, sir.
Is that an Air-a-dale Retriever?
The tail won't fool me!
Sir, you gotta climb on up there and bring him down.
his name may be Kite but you still have to take him to the dog park
I don't know if you noticed, sir...but there's
something strange about your kite's tail
“ We’ll let it go this time.   Just keep him on a long leash, and pick up after him.”
All this time I thought a bird dog was something completely different.
Just because your emotional support dog flies with you everywhere, doesn't make him a kite.
I’m sorry sir, you’ll need to take that to the dog park.
Please tell me you are not flying that thing with a break-away collar.
Okay, your dog can stay, but you need to clean up after him.
Hey Bub! Dogs must be on a six-foot leash.
Just a reminder. Unlike the other kite flyers, you're still required to carry a scooper.
Don’t arrest me, he’s half flying squirrel!
This is no place for a psycho, sir.
Last summer, I had a pig, but it did the most amazing thing. Not taking any chances this year.
Sorry sir, Saturday is bird dog day.
I'm sorry sir but you can't fly your dog here.
I don’t care if he just pooped. He has to come down.
We got complaints about your kid walking a kite at the dog park.
The no dogs rule extends up fifty feet.
We've been getting some very angry complaints about droppings.
I understand sir, but you still need to pick up after it.
He may very well "put the air in Airedale", sir, nevertheless I'll still need to see his license.
Dogs must be on a 6 ft leash.
We fly kites here, not inflated dogs.
Sir, it may be the dog days of summer but you can’t be here.
Leash not to exceed 12 feet in length, sir.
The signs clearly state "leash".
Have you seen my helium tank?
I don't care if it's what Teddy would have wanted, rules are rules!
Sir, your kite needs approval from the ASPCA
Look, I'm not going to argue about this anymore. You have to take him to a dog park.
You got a license for that kite ?
I say it's a dog, and this isn't a dog park!
I assume that's a licensed therapy dog?
I know my kites, officer
I don't care if he's on a lease and his name is Fala - no dogs allowed.
Sir, dog day afternoon is in August.
Has a gas problem, right?
Roosevelt hated dogs!
No Officer, it wasn’t difficult at all!
I don't care if it's an emotional support animal, it needs to come down.
I said take a hike, not fly a kite.
Of course it's legit.  It's the president's 'transitional object.'
Sir, it doesn't matter if your dog's name is Roosevelt.
Well in that case, you'll just have to carry  a catcher's mitt, won't you?
We have a strict catch and release policy in this park.
Sir, you'll have to go. I've had complaints about a sh#tstorm.
Park rules require you to curb your dog.
Sure it checks all the boxes, but I am afraid that I just stepped in the one box that says it’s not a kite.
An Airedale?  Is this some kind of joke to you?
I'm reenacting one of Benjamin Franklin's lesser known experiments.
I'll alow it, but this won't fly at the skate park.
I see that he's on a leash. But he ain't no kite.
Sir, leashes are to be a maximum of six feet long.
We’ve had complaints that your kite is a real dog”.
Sir, you’ll need to show off your old dog’s new tricks at the K-9 Kite Park.
No, my dog is too afraid of heights to even try it.
I think you have can't hear or have a drinking problem. I seriously doubt that Mary Poppins said 'let's go fly a coyote'.
I don't care if it is an Airedale.
Sir, your kite is a dog
You are aware this is a leash-free park?
No, no, no...I said,, "I'll let you join the junior rangers squad when PIGS fly."
I'm sorry, sir, dog flying is not permitted in this park.
Sorry Sir but you must leave. Dogs must be on a leash not a string.
Of course, you need to clean up after your dog.
He better not take a piss while his up there.
How about you just take him for a walk next time.
Impressive, but the standard clean-up regulations still apply.
Liberal.
The only thing Scooter is afraid of is fear itself.
No pets allowed, sir. And the kite disguise won't work.
I don't care if he's an airdale or ailmary, curb your dog!
All right pal, time to go.  Your dog has had his day.
All right, if you say so, but he doesn't look like an Airedale to me!
5 more minutes and then it's small dog-kite flying time.
That’s fine sir, but let me remind you to clean up after him, and good luck with that!
I suppose you're another Booth fan?
I'm sorry, but my boss says it's not a leash
No tail?
Now That, That is a baloon animal!
Yeah, the vet suggested this as a way to cure his flatulence. He loves it, and once he comes down, he sleeps like a rock.
No   dogs allowed, sir.
I understand that he has flatulence and the thinner air up there helps him - but it doesn't help us down here.  I'll back away and you bring him down.
There are no helium dogs at this park, sir.
Is he a rescue?
I don't care how you did that, gimme back my police dog.
He's my emotional sport animal.
All I said was "Good boy" but I guess he heard "Good buoy."
Just because he has a tail doesn't mean he's a kite."
No predators allowed in the park before dark.
No sir, I'm not from the S.P.C.A., but they're on their way.
Sir I like the 3D view
But, the other sign said “no dogs allowed on the grass.”
We don't do representational here.
Maybe it's his diet.
Have you not considered implications of the extra tailwind?
I don't care if it's an aerdale, -- you have to take him to the dog park.
Your dog has to be on a leash at all times.
I just saw your "kite" tinkle.
Is that a drone?
It doesn't matter that it's a bird dog; the leash must be no longer than 6 feet!
No dogs allowed? Not even this one?
Technically yes, but he still needs to come down.
Sir, you are in violation of the maximum leash length law.
Don't cry wolf if your kite falls  out of the sky.
That is not yellow rain!
PETA is  not amused.
Cute dog. Whats his name?
Really . . . ?
Just because it has a tail doesn't mean it belongs here...
Think he would give me a turn?
Sorry, he needs a real leash.
Wow! That one has some tailwind!……
He loves flying, officer.  He's an airedale.
Technically he’s still off-leash.
Are you the guy who left your kite locked in a hot car?
Thank you for returning my kite officer. He is a rescue kite so he has seen some pretty rough winds.
Was that you singing "They Can't Take That Away from Me"?
I’m an enforcement officer with the ASPCA; you’re under arrest.
I assume that’s an Airedale.
What did your taxidermist use?
Amazing, yes, but you still need to pick up after him!
You need to move to the dog park.
My taxidermist uses helium.
Frank.  The new deal is over.
If your kite poops your required to catch it before it hits the ground.
Just make sure he stays on leash.
Yes, Officer, Happy insisted we make a statement on the final vote.
I'm sorry, sir, but dog leashes cannot be longer than six feet.
What up, dog? Outside of your dog, that is...
Cute, yes. But does he have a license?
All dogs use the dog park—even Superman’s.
Sir, I have asked you before not to fly your dog while there are children in the park.
Sir, I’m  going to need you to pick up after your kite.
Guess he thinks he is an Airedale?
Your tail is too short
If you decide to walk your kite in the dog park, you’ll need a license for that!
Sir, it's still no dogs allowed, even if they're on a leash.
Perhaps a different food wouldn't leave him so bloated?
Sorry sir, this is no longer a dog park
Sir, Fala was a Scottie.
That's what they said about the Wright Brothers
Nice airdale, but I've told you before 'this isn't a dog park!'
I won't give you a ticket, but you'll have to pick up after your kite.
I guess it's true what they say about boxers.
I must have left my Kite at the dog park!
What? It's like a leash.
Yes, I see he’s on a leash, but the dog park is on the other side of the park.
I've got the same breed at home. She can't fly, of course, but she can sure fetch a stick like nobody's business.
What's your problem, pal?  At least half The New Yorker readers know what I'm about to tell you.
I don’t care how you’re doing it, you still have to pick up his poop.
YOU KNOW SIR, YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE POOP
But sir...I'm just doing what I can, with what I have, where I am.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to use the "off-leash" area
Don't act like you've never seen a therapy kite.
It would have been better if you had used the tRump baby balloon from the UK!!
Sorry, today it's vegetables or minerals only.
You and the guy across the way have to leave. This park is exclusively for righties."
You know, he'd probably be more stable with a harness vest on...
His name is Hiasakite.
If you let it go, I’ll let you go.
You'll need to fly a poop bag
Which one is Roosevelt?
Not all dogs go to heaven.
Sorry, no dogs allowed, even if they ARE on a leash!
Yesterday, some idiot tried to fly a French Bulldog.   I thought everybody knows you can't fly one without a tail.
This is a K-9 No-Fly Zone.
There have been some complaints.
Sorry, buddy. You can't fly that dog here without a pooper umbrella.
I respectfully disagree. He just doesn’t get the same feeling putting his head out the window no matter how fast we drive
That looks exactly like My ex-wife’s dog, Lulu.
He huffed, and he puffed...
I'm sorry sir, but a woman with a bouffant asked me to remind you to curb your dog.
Bring it down.I'm the dog catcher
What? I'm a taxidermist...
Mr. Romney, I presume?
all right buddy,real him in...
I've heard of check kiting, but dog kiting?
I don’t mind you flying your dog.  But he’s got to stop buzzing the baby strollers.
I watch CSI. I can tell it's from him by the splatter pattern.
Just remember to curb your kite.
Are you aware of the SPCA ban on pets breathing helium?
Thank you for observing our leash law.
Truly sir, a floral or stripe design is indeed required.
That ain’t a kite and that ain’t a leash, sir
Please stop bringing your Aidedale.
I'm afraid we're tired of your flying wolf all the time.
All I did was tell him to sit Officer.
Either you're Mary Poppins or there's going to be a really good explanation for this...
No drones allowed.  No dogs allowed.  So absolutely no drone dogs allowed!
He's taking a break from the prozac
You’re expected to clean up after your kite.
Hey, buddy--this isn't a dog park!
Yes I can see it's a lot more pleasant when we're wearing hats.
No sir, technically, that does not count as a leash.
We received a reports of a flying pig. Carry on.
Make sure he doesn't poop"
Please clean up after your kite, sir.
I'm sorry ! , but you've exceeded the local dog leash length requirement !
Sir, your dog shat upon my head.
Airedale, huh? I have a Lab who's scared of the vacuum.
No, a kite string is not technically a leash.
Poor fella got into my stash, he is going to be like this for a couple hours.
Thanks for obeying the park's lease law.
But officer, without the string he’d just drift away!
I'm sorry but dogs are not allowed in the park; even on leashes.
OK, you proved your point- the tail is the key to flight control.
Just remember to clean up after your kite.
I'd hate to see what you do to him at the skate park.
Have you lost your keys?
As long as you keep him on a leash, sir.
Normally, our catch and release policy applies to fish only.
Sir, the helium dog park is in the next field over.
I don't care if he thinks he's a 
Flying squirrel!
You need to Curb Your Kite.
Well, I guess it does count as a leash.
I don't care if he's on a leash.
I use a regular kite at the dog park!
My kite doesn't bite.
Curb your dog!
Sir, it appears you need to pick up after your kite.
Sir, do you have a license to fly that dog?
Just make sure it doesn’t get off the leash again.
I don't care if the dog park is closed today.
Please walk your dog like everyone else.  We've been shit upon enough.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to cease and desist dog fighting the other kites.
I’m sorry, sir; there is no exception for Airedales.
He gets off leash, it could be trouble is all I'm saying.
I'm afraid his dog tags don't cover flying.
You have to leave your drunk dog is higher than a kite
Probably not a good test of unconditional love
Is your dog licensed?
No, Teddy, nor Franklin would approve!
Sir, the rules state you  must clean up after your kite.
OK.  What did your feed your dog to produce this much gas?
I don’t know what your dogs on, but this is a drug free zone.
Your dog's rabies shots up to date?
We have a strict ‘no dogs’ policy. I’m sorry, but you and Fala must leave.
He's trying out for the next "Underdog" movie.
You know it's illegal, but how did
you get the dog so pumped up, anyway ?
It's pronounced 'a-KEET-ah', not 'a-KITE-ah.'
Thank you for abiding the leash law.
String-break, dog-gone. Get it?
I'm just exercising my bird dog.
It's okay, it's my comfort animal.
...But flying squirrel roping is a family tradition!
Even if you do call him Fala, when you land him you're both off to the pound.
It’s fine, just don’t forget to clean up after him.
Just don't let him off the leash.
I'm going to have to pat you down for your stash.  Your dog is as high as a kite!
Pilot strike.
Your kite shit on a homeless person.
As long as he stays on his leash, I don't care what you do.
This isn't the leash I had in mind.
I don't care if he's a Mind over Matter dog--you don't have a license for this!
OK. OK. SO the tail keeps it from spinning and rolling. But you still can't fly it here until you stop it from whizzing all over everyone else!
No.  And I don’t care if Underdog does it in the Macy’s Parade.
I don't care if he isn't on the park grounds- by extension he is
Sir, there are no dog fights allowed in this kite park.
You know the rule: tail longer than body.
Dogs must be on a leash. That's a kite string.
No, Franklin!
Sir, I understand her name is Earhart, but she can’t fly here.
I'm not even mad, impressed more than anything.
Sorry, only when pigs fly.
For obvious reasons, you'll need to diaper that dog.
Sir, you're still required to bag his poop.
You’re a disgrace to Roosevelt
I just came over here to make sure you weren't enjoying yourself. It is a kite park afterall.
Sorry, sir.  You can only fly liberal kites here.
You DO Know the clean-up fines are heavier over here.
I'm sure it's a nice view. But bring him down.
Airedale or no airedale this is a kite park.. The dog park is down the street
...free like a bird, but the 'fallout' is of a different caliber altogether.

Barbara Druskoff
druskoff@att.net
Sir, I suggest the 'Off Leash' area.
Park Security:  I told you, dogs are not allowed in this park.

Man:  But Rover's not in the park, he's in the air.
Is that Airedale licensed?
The kites tail has to be longer than it’s body.
Just a friendly reminder, Sir.  No off leash here."
You're still responsible for picking up after her.
You're OK. But one guy didn't have his dog on a leash.
It has to be neutered or spayed.
It’s the dog itself, I fear.
OK, just make sure you clean up after your kite
Scooping it up and putting it in a bag isn't good enough.
I guess you’re right. The only rules you’re actually violating are physics and aerodynamics related. Have a nice day.
What have you been feeding her?
There have been complaints of your kite sniffing the other kites.
He can only get as high as the leash allows.
Sir, the reason they don't have dog licenses is that those aren't real dogs.
Just waiting for my neighbor to show up.
You can't fly your dog here, Airedale or not.
Wrong park. Try the wind tunnel park in Dearborn.
I'd say it's pretty clear how he provides emotional support, thank you.
The rule is no dogs on the grounds, but...
The Millenials call this 'Sustainable'
You know that dogs are not allowed in the park.
That's what I call an isolated shower.
Do you have a Permit for flying dogs?
If he can’t refrain from peeing on the other park goers I’ll have to ask you both to leave.”
That kite of yours better be either spayed or neutered!
Tell him he needs to grow a longer tail.
I see you’re following the new leash law!
The dog park was five blocks farther.
No, sir. This did not happen in _Mary Poppins_.
Ground, air, doesn't matter. You still gotta use a pooper scooper.
I don't care if he is an Airedale, he still isn't a kite
Sorry, you can only fly moose here.
You should see her when she flies over the moon!
Look, I hate to bother a good kite flier like yourself, but apparently someone has kidnapped Gunther the flying dog, have you seen him?
Here it’s not “pup, pup and  away”, it’s “up up and away”.
If he's as high as a kite, you'll have to bring him down.
Recreational doesn't meaning flying high as a kite!
I don‘t know what you‘re talking about.
What can I tell you? He said he wanted to fly.
Sorry, he gets "heel" and "helium" confused.
Have ou tried feeding her Bean-O?
I don't care if your name is Roosevelt Kite, you can't fly a helium-filled dog here.
No kites in the dog park, no dogs in the kite park.
Don't act surprised. I've already had this 'talk' with you and everyone else in The Taxidermy Glider's Club.
Excuse me but people are complaining that your kite has been trying to hump theirs.
Did you let him do his business before getting up there?
If he slobbers just once, you're out of here.
I've seen a lot of gassy dogs in my life but...
Picking up after him must be a challenge.
He's in training to be the ultimate bird dog.
Sorry, sir. Only neutered dogs at the park.
I know that it's a sturdy string, but you must still have him on a leash.
Pot Fest is next week.
I don’t care if he’s an Airedale, sir. You can’t fly him here.
If he bites any of the kites I'll have to ask you to leave....
Stealing cars is a lot easier when people think you're a valet.
Sir, are you the owner of the silver SUV in the lot?
Sorry, pal, the AKC says there's no such breed as a ' Flying Wallenda'.
Skye terrier my ass.
Can you believe all those weirdos?
The command is heal, not helium!
Tell Falkor, hello, from Bastian.  He knows who I am.
License and dog-flying registration please.
I don't care if Rocky is your friend, legally he is not a kite.
I'm sorry but Fly Your Pet Day is tomorrow.
Sorry, no pets allowed.
Where are your plastic bags, sir?
No, that's a KIT fox, and you can't fly it here.
Sorry, no dogist kites allowed.
This isn't about leash laws, sir.  I just don't want the shih tzu to hit kite fans.
Well,ok, if she's a sky terrier.
Does he think he's an Airedale Terrier?
No can do with the airborne canine, sir
Personally, I think cats are better aerodynamically, but you still need a license to fly that thing.
Your kite is a biological hazard.
I get that he is on a leash but this ain't the dog park.
We banned the flying squirrel, so I'm afraid Flying Fido will have to go, too.
I need to see his rabies tag!
It’s okay, officer. This is just a walk in the park for Kite and me.
This is not Roosevelt Higher Than a Kite Park, sir.
Airedale, shmairedale!! Dogs aren't allowed in this section of the park. Please go now.
A taxidermist living his truth.
He's fine on-leash, but what's the plan for waste management?
So it's an Airedale, huh?
The sign says 'kite park,' not bite park.
Sorry sir, the tail is too short.
Sorry, this isn't permitted till the dog days of August.
Maybe you could have him neutered.
Just be sure to clean up your dog's poop.
We've noticed that you have not been cleaning up after your kite.
I see that Rodney has taken to the fly command without any problems.
Don’t think I don’t know what your doing.
Sorry to bother you, but your kite is shitting on everything.
Just be sure he doesn't go off leash!
Despite it being spread all around, you still have to pick it up.
Your kite needs a diaper.
Unfortunately you are only allowed to fly kites and elephants here sir.
Now just a doggone minute, sir....
No room at the dog park, sir?
We got complaints of your dog doing number one and two on people's head .
I don't care that your dog is an Airedale,  you have to go to the dog park.
Next time, don't use a balloon to play fetch.
You’re under arrest for getting your dog high.
No Dog Park for him. He doesn't play well with others.
She said she'd marry when dogs can fly.
People are complaining that your kite is peeing on them
It's against the contest rules to have the tail wagging.
He just needs to get some air, Officer !
Is that the new dog drone kite that defecates on its enemies?
What's in a name?" That which we call a kite
By any other name...goes two blocks over to the dog park
Okay, okay.  I know it's the year of the dog, but jeez....
We have a six foot leash ordinance.
Do you have a permit to fly a quadriped?
I'm with the ASPCA.
Don't worry, he's fixed.
your dog's high pitched bark is breaking windows in the neighborhood sir.
Airedales only, sir.
That's the worst case of separation anxiety I've ever seen.
Dog flying is only on Tuesdays.
This area is off-leash only
Just remember to be respectful to the other visitors and curb your dog.
Is your kite up-to-date with his shots?
Are you one of those MS13 guys?
Any creature high on drugs is not allowed in this park.
Please curb your dog, sir.
That's not what "raise the roof" means
We don't allow Air Force dog fight practice here"
Sorry sir, you need to go to the dog park.
Sir, would you like a plastic bag to clean up after your kite?
If you backed off, he’d quit marking his territory.
I'm not sure this technically counts as a leash.
This cartoon doesn't make any sense.
Paper or plastic.  No fur.
I don't care if he's on a leash. No dogs allowed.
Mixed breeds are down the road.
Regardless, you’ll still need to take him to the DOG park.
We're going to need you to leave sir. That kind of tail isn't allowed in the park.
Sorry, dog kite strings can't be longer than six feet.
Just so you know - no aerial dogfights allowed...
Do you have a license to fly that thing?
You made it yourself you say?
I get it. Very funny. An Airedale. But Inappropriate.
It’s a one-dog kite.
I know it’s a kite park, but my Airedale loves 
hanging around here
I'm going to have to issue you a citation for breaking the law of gravity. Markell West markellorhighwater@gmail.com 301 725 9378.  

No dog-walking in the kite park. Stephen West sleepeesteev@gmail.com, 301 725 9378
We're getting complaints about acid rain.
Sir, you will still have to pick up and dispose before leaving.
The theme for today’s festival is “carnival”- not “carnivore”.
I don't care if its name is "Kite", it's still a dog, and it needs a dog tag and a collar.
He’s cute, but he’s no Underdog...
Your K9 needs to head over to Cloud Nine
He’s not on the grass.
Sir, I believe you've missed the point.
Well then you shouldn't allow bone-shaped kites either!
Sorry, no animals allowed in this park.
- Sir, park regulations do not allow flying dogs here.
 - But he's technically on a leash, officer.
Sir I understand your dog is having an identity crisis and everyone’s really impressed with the flying but the spraying is real problem!
I need to see your kite's papers.
Sorry, sir. This is not a dog kite park.
But you said, "Dogs must be kept on a leash."
You better have brought more than your poop bag with you.
You don't have to leave, just don't give him so much water before coming here next time.
I know.  And he's still off leash.
For the last time, sir, flying a dog will not conduct electricity!
It is certainly a good good day for flying your dog.
Sir, in the park area dogs have to be muzzled
The other contestants think you're dogging it.
If that dog is a kite, you need to put a diaper on it.
Because ya gotta run to fly a kite.
Even though your taxidermist stuffed him with helium, he is still NOT a kite!
Hey, that’s the new super leash from QVC isn’t it?
No sir, balloon animals are not allowed.
Sir, has your kite had its rabies shot?
This park has a strict rule against helium breeds.
As you can imagine, we don't condone going off-leash in this park.
Do you have proof of your kite’s vaccinations?
Has your kite had it's rabies shots?
Yes, even though his name is ‘Kite’ . . .
Scoop up or scram.
Airedale terrier I presume?
I'm sorry, sir.  You need a license to fly your dog.
I'm afraid it's not just semantics sir.
I don’t care if it is an Airedale, pull it down
Yes, but I'm afraid yours is far too disturbingly realistic.
Yes, I know you're a contrarian. And yes, yes. I know, they told you to go fly a kite..
You have advanced to stage 2 in dirigible training.
I don't care if he's a high strung dog.
So this dog is not your best friend!
Just tell him that good boys don't fly.
Oh the humanity.
I don't care if they do let you fly it in Boca Raton, you can't fly it here.
Does the helium give him that high pitched bark too?
What part of the leash law don't you understand, sir?
I'm wondering if your dog is not the only one who is high as a kite?
How else can a Newfoundland "find new lands?"
Tis a Kite Park not a Protest Park.
That's no way to let the dog out...
Yeah, the other day a guy came in with Bullwinkle kite... You should look him up.
Sorry no dogs allowed, even on a leash.
Mrs. Ritterhouse objects to your flying your dog, sir, despite your promise to clean up after him.
I see you've tried the pet dispensary around the corner? Do you have enough treats after she comes down?
A license is required to own a flying squirrel?
Ok
Sorry, sir, the taxidermy park is in Brooklyn.
I get it - girls just wanna have fun!
Sir, you'll have to take yours to the dog-kite flying park.
Don't quote leash laws to me!
Sir, you have to leave. Your kite keeps “going” on the flyers
Clean up after your kite.
Are you aware that wolves are protected, Sir?
If that's Fala, you're under arrest!
We had a report of an aerial bombardment.
Only six feet above the hand holding the leash.
I don't care if his name is roosevelt...bring him down!
I don't care if he's Krypto the superdog. You're still responsible for picking up after him.
Is that the smashed dried-up dog that was on Fulton Street last week.  I'm sorry, but it has to be impounded for the kids sake.
He is a natural floater
This is what Fala would have wanted.
These air bud sequels are getting ridiculous.
Everything’s up in the air!
I'm sorry, sir, your dog cannot chase the kites here
No live kites allowed!
Vegetarian kites only, sir.
Local Birdwatchers called in a complaint claiming Ratbird is scaring off all the others
Above the grass counts as on the grass
I’ll be doggone.
Fine. As long as she stops chasing the other kite’s tails...
No one has ever complained about pulled pork.
Shouldn’t your wife be flying a super-sized pooper scooper?
OK, fine -- but has she been a good doggie woggie?
But sir, do you know how hard it is to make a balloon out of your dead dog?
Sir, did you read the sign?
Don't forget that you still have to pick up after him.
Sir, we've had complaints and I'm pretty sure no dog likes to fly that high.
Sir, can't you read the sign? This is a kite flying park, not a rejected-balloon-animal-flying-park"
We don't think this qualifies him as a service animal.
Park", not "Bark
I don't care if he does like it, sir, the pigeons are claiming unfair competition.
Filling your dog with gas doesn’t turn it into a kite.
Did you know that Aire-dales are a prohibited breed in this park, sir?
Sir, I'm no veterinarian, but I think your dog has gas.
That's frowned upon in Korea
I don't care if it's on Chairman Meow's bucket list, sir.
Let me guess, his name is Roosevelt?
We don’t care that you’re going to scoop afterwards....we’re worried  about where you think it’s going to land!!!!
You should be flying your dog over in the dog park
Did you feed him Alpo with beans or Alpo with beef ?
No furry kites in the park.
Don't forget to collect your space debris.
The dog area is on the other side of the park.
I don't care if his name is Fala!
I'm sorry sir, you're only allowed to fly dead animals here.
You're not supposed to have a dog in that fight, er, I meant kite.
Do you have any controlled substances on you?
Sir, if you have filled that dog with helium I going to have to report you to the doggie police.
Nice try. Hand over the helium...
A tail and a spine does not qualify her as a kite.
I hope you have a scooper?
That's not a kite...that's a balloon.
Impressive, but you and your "air" dale should be over in the dog park.
I get the television reference but wolves are an endangered species!
Sorry pal.  Dogs aren't allowed in this park.  
You might try highway driving with her window rolled down.
Airedale terriers are not allowed.
If you could put a pit bull up, I'd look the other way, since the other kites would be gone.
Is your taxidermist licensed?
I don't give a hoot what he's doing, your dog needs to be on a leash, sir.
I think you can fly dogs in Jersey.
He's been doing this ever since we saw that hypnotist act in Vegas.
Bob, I’ve told you a 1000 times, he has to fly into the wind.
Sir, park rules have to be followed- you must WALK your dog on a leash.”
I think it’s about time you brought ‘Poop Chute’ down.”
He‘s just a little gassy.
You need to walk him before you fly him.
I hope you brought enough umbrellas for everybody.
No dogs allowed, even on a leash.
Um... it's my service animal.
Where can I get one of those? I think my wife, would love it!
No dogs allowed means no dogs allowed.
He didn't want to to do it but I talked him into it.
Sir, I thought I told you yesterday,  if he’s going to be up there he needs to wear a diaper.
The Macy's parade isn't until November.
What's the big idea, Fala?
Your kite doesn't have an appropriate tail, Sir.
He pooped already right?
Leashes more than ten feet long are against Park regulations.
Sorry, sir, I refuse to believe his bark is worse than this.
Sorry - kite-otes are illegal!
Unless his name is Falah, you're in the wrong place.
You don't recognize Fala? It's Roosevelt's dog!
Your papers, please.
Even though you say he's park broken it´s too risky to fly him here. Take him over the hill to the Nixon Dog Park.
Sir, The dog park is just over the hill.
At least he’s on a leash.
My wife told me to go fly a kite. My dog's name is kite.
Bad case of gas?
you're gonna need an airbag if he goes
It is a breed known for producing enormous flatulence.
Sir, don't you think you're taking the Chinese Year of the Dog too seriously?
If he isn't riding a doghouse, he doesn't belong.
You're still going to have to pick up after him.
Animal Control will here about this
Is your dog air broken?
The kite’s good, but helium in a live dog is not.
FLYING YOUR DOG WITHOUT A PERMIT WILL SURELY GET YOU THREE DAYS IN JAIL.
I’m afraid you and your weird dog are no longer welcome here.
You need to get your Airedale out of here, Sir.
Technically there’s no law about picking-up after your kite.
There’s a rule against using helium
What's your plan for the poop?
This park only allows vegan kites.
You give new meaning to "Curb your dog".
You used to kite checks, right?
Sir, this park is for "Kites Only"
You need to take your doggie kite to the dog park, Sir
Sir, people from PETA are complaining about your use of a mega- flatulent animal for a kite.
On second thought, put him back in the hot car.
Let me get this straight. Your dog ate your kite AND a whole bottle of Wonka Fizzy Lifting Drink?!
I know what you're thinking, my dog's super-high. But it's not my fault, he's a meth lab.
His name's Isaac, and he's a spaniel.
Actually the ordinance doesn't mention any particular breeds.
I’m sorry, sir, but the rules of the physical world are very clear.
You say the First Amendment gives you the right to fly any kite you choose? I say the Second Amendment gives me the right to shoot your damned kite down.
I don't care if it IS an Airedale, this is the kite park!
Sir, this is an animal free zone
I shouldn't have to remind you again to pick up after your dog.
I don’t care how gassy meat makes him. The dog park is up the road.
I'm sorry, dogs are not allowed
Sir, we have had multiple complaints that you are not picking up after your dog.
Excuse me, sir. I don't mean to sound discriminatory, but the Trump Dog Flying Park is next door...just over that wall.
You can fly it here, but show me your palms, now!
This is not a dog kite park.
Sir,kindly curb your dog
I'm gonna kill your dog
A six foot leash sir.
Some guy complained that your kite sprinkled on him.
We've had complaints about rain...
Sorry, the dog park is crazy on Sundays.
Well, we ain't fishin'.
And what makes you think I would have anything to do with this so-called 'yellow rain' people are complaining about?
I think that you are misunderstanding the leash law.
He can cool off somewhere else.
Hey, my taxidermist paid for this. I have every right to be here.
Sir, the dog park is located at 5th and Hudson.
Sir, please just scoop up your "kite's" poop.
Sir I know it’s all a simulation, but this is getting a little out of hand.
The Wonderdog family, not the Rosssevelts sponsor the dog flying park
Can I try?
Do you know how far past the leash limit you're going?
How many times have I told you to put socks on that kite.
Well, I guess it's OK as long as he stays on his leash.
It looks like a dog.  It barks like a dog.  Sir, it is a dog, not a kite.
have him sit
I had a rescue Airborne Airedale too! Called mine Sister Bertrille. One day she just flew pup, pup, and away!
He better be potty trained!
Sorry sir, scottish terriers only
Officer his name IS roosevelt.....
Light as a kite I see.
There have been complaints. Does your kite bite?
I haven't seen a bitch this high since Lindsey Lohan's mental breakdown lol
I’m sorry but he is still technically not on a leash.
Our terms of service have changed...
I said, reel in, sir. Animal cruelty is in the eye of the beholder.
I'll admit, this just the seed round.
But doesn't that technically make it a pigeon?
Yours isn't too colorful.
This is the last warning about your kite marking its territory.
You got ANY idea how that girl can get a box kite to fly?
And how exactly  do you intend picking up after Fido?
...Trump says the economy is flourishing,...hm.. Pigs fly..."
I’m afraid there have been reports of scattered golden showers in the area.
Make sure your contain all and pick up all  of the "leaking" molecules of 
extruded waste.
Sir you need to cut back on the amount of  Beano you feed your dog
You're not the type of nervous flyer a service dog is meant for.
Excuse me sir,but that leash is entirely too long!
But it isn't a dog park now"
He’s an Air-Dale.
This is the kite park, not the dog park.
What does that mutt think he is?...an Airedale?!
Sir, I understand your dog's name is Kite, but this isn't his park.
And just how do you plan to curb him?
I don’t care if he’s an Airedale, he doesn’t meet the park regulations!
As long as you gave him gluten-free helium
I know it’s the Year of the Dog, sir but you still need to have a real kite instead!
No, excuse you, officer: My seeing-eye dog prefers an aerial view... And no, I won't pick up his poop.
The dog park is one exit back.
Bring him down now, and understand that the consequences will be on your hands if you release the helium too quickly.
Sorry, no dogs
Christ, what an asshole.
He’s been doing TM since he was a puppy.
It's O.K., Officer.  He is a Skye terrier.
It doesn't matter that it's an airedale.
What do you feed him?
I'm sorry ,Sir, but animals are not allowed in this park.
This does not qualify as walking your dog on leash.
Separate you and your dog? I’m a dogcatcher, not a monster!!
Excuse me Sir, this is Roosevelt Kite Park, not Rover Kite Park.
I was ready to cut off my arm if he would just stop barking at night
Sir, the mayor would like to have a word with you.
Sir, your dog does not have a collar and tag.
you say it's a leash, i call it a string
Fine officer. If I can't fly my dog then I guess i'll just go drag my kite around the dog park...
I have a remedy for gassy dogs.
Fly your dog somewhere else.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to stop giving your dog LSD.
Your dog is a fast learner, but no!
Nice try, but we don't allow pets in here. Period.
You have been disqualified, the tail is to short.
Yes, that's impressive. But you still have to pick up after her.
I suggest you bring an umbrella with you next time.
This is a vegan kite park, you’ll have to leave!
Border Collie?
Sorry, but this is the small dog park.
We’ve had complaints, is there any way you can stop the howling?
Your dog have gas?
I don't care if he is housebroken,  get your Airdale down from there and take him to the "dog" park.
You can't fool me, buddy - no dogs allowed in the kite park!
The flying dog contest is in the next field over.
I’m sorry sir but all kites must be registered with the FAA.
Those kites have nothing to fear except fear itself
Sorry, but you still have to pick up it's poop.
I have a message from Flo.
I'm from the SPCA. Please come quietly.
Where's your poop bag?
He ate a bunch of birthday balloons and the rest is history.
Nice try. Dog park is four blocks south of here.
Please remember to clean up after your kite, sir.
The dog park was off-leash only.
Technically, you are not in violation of the leash law, but don't let the PETA people catch you.
You can't engage in dogfights with the other kites!
I keep him on a long leash.
Sir, that doesn't qualify as a leash.
Only if his name is Fala, sir.
Sir, I don't think TR would appreciate flying wildlife in this National Park.
Feeling a bit aggressive today?
Sorry sir...but helium is against park regulations.
oh we got ourselves a wise guy
I left my kite at the Dog Park.
Don't you think playing fetch might be a bit tricky?
...You're saying you've never seen Air-Bud?
I don't care if he is on a leash... NO dogs!
There’s always one wise guy in the crowd.
If you think this is nice you should visit the Nixon Hide and Seek Park
Hey, Buddy, that's just a piece of string, and it's called a "leash law."
We have been getting complaints about "yellow rain."
Sorry sir, pets are not permitted in this area
I.C.E. here. Someone reported you for looking different.
Please don't forget to pick up your kite's feces.
Sorry, but the park only permit kites that obey the Laws of Physics.
I’ll be honest, this isn’t really what we meant when we told you to keep it on leash
I don't care if he is an Airedale, he can't be up there.
Golden retrievers are not kites.
I don’t care if your dog does have gas, you can’t fly him in this park.
Park rules state that all dogs must be on a leash. I don't believe kite string qualifies!
I don't care that your dog's name is Kite.
While we allow dogs in this park if on leash, we haven't stipulated their welcome if tethered to a balloon
Even though it's an Airedale, it has to be on a short leash.
The only thing to fear is the bite itself.
I’m sorry, sir, but your leash is more than six feet long.
You’ve never seen an emotional support service animal?
Ever since the Denver dog show, he’s been high as a ....
We've had complaints...you need to curb your dog...
Sir, you can't fly your dog here.
No individuality allowed!
Sir, I don’t care if his name is Lindbergh, your dog needs to be walked.
Sir, I have to write you a ticket. Rules are rules, only pigs can fly.
Cat food?  Don't you know feeding them cat food gives them really bad gas?
H.R 2331 Requires all animals to be on a short lease
Yeah, once we saw all the pigs fly, we figured it was just a matter of time...
Sorry officer.  I thought this was a Kite Bark.
I'm not gonna ask you again, Mr. Stevens.
No more pidgeon hunting!
If he has an accident, it's on you friend.
Puppy uppers aren't allowed here.
If he farts, you're disqualified for jet propulsion.
We're from ICE. May we see your kite's paperwork?
You need to give him something to stop the gas
I'm sorry, this is not a doggie park
Sir, the dog park is one block over.
You should have never let him swallow that balloon.
Keep away from that girl in the Red Hood.
is that better be a flying squirrel.
We've had a complaint of a kite bite, have you seen anything suspicious?
Well I saw a pig flying the other day.
I had an Airedale once, until he dived.
But Officer I have my  Kiteyote on leash what's the problem?
Here's a couple of waste bags for you sir. I find those Labradors good fliers but real messy.
Charlie got into my edibles again.
No kite-bending allowed at Roosevelt, sir. Let's make kite parks great again.
My butt doesn't think he's a kite
I just felt another drop. What could that be?
A KITE-yote, sir? Well played.
I hope you're are planning on picking up after your kite.
It’s not a violation if he’s a service dog
You can't fly your dog here.
What type of service kite is it?
I don't care if he's an Airedale; he belongs in the dog park.
Sir, I advise you to stop before PETA takes notice.
Only real kites allowed. Because it has a tail doesn't make it a kite
Did a flasher and his dog pass by here a moment ago?
Sir, I don't care if he's an Airedale, dog park is down the street.
I thought we were doing balloons
There have been complaints from the poop patrol....
"No flying giant dead rats in the park without a pass."
Officer, my therapist has approved Sparky to fly for my emotional support.
Is your dog an airdale?
Has your animal kite eaten anything recently that would make it's bowel movement irregular?
Oh sh***t. That's where the dog went!
Technically, it's still walking your dog
It doesn't matter that he was a stand in for Underdog, the sign says Kite Park, not Dog Park.
Sir, you wouldn't want me to walk my kite at your dog park, now would you?
Sir,  this is not the dog park.
THAT'S A VERY REALISTIC LOOKING KITE, BUT IF I HEAR A BARK , YOU'RE GETTING A TICKET, BUD!
I don't care that he's high as a kite, no dogs allowed.
Curb your dog, buddy
Gassy or not, no dogs allowed, sir.
And how would you like it if I brought my kite to the dog park.
An Airedale?  For real?
You had to see the "No Helium" sign at the entrance.  Now, slowly pull Fido back to the ground.
Sorry, that's too orthogonal to the hypertext kite protocol.
Excuse me, dogs are not allowed in this park.
I know it's an Airedale, where's your poop bag?
As long as he's on a leash, it's all good.
The tail's okay, but sorry, the rest of the dog can't fly here.
I'm sorry sir but we've had complaints of you not cleaning up after your dog.
Sir, you need to fly that down to the Dog Park.
Oh! I thought it was pronounced 'kitty' park
Is your kite up to date on its shots?
Sir I won't tell you again, this is not the dog park!
Look! I don't make the laws buddy, you can take this up with Mr. Newton!
So this doesn't violate 'Kite Park' rules because he's a therapy dog and an Airedale?
What about "paw"? Can he do "paw"?
Take my wife, please.
Quite frankly sir, your " kite"  has a urinary problem .
Bird dog or not, you're in the wrong park.
I don't care how much cocaine he ate, get him outta here.
But the leash must be 10 feet or less, sir.
You think this is funny, wait til you hear him bark!
Pumping your dog full of helium doesn’t make this a dog park.
Why is everyone who's having fun white and the low-wage security guy a person of color?
Sir, we need you to bring you kite down. We no longer allow diversity. Fear is not the only thing we fear anymore.
I realize your dog was run over by the steam roller, but it still needs a tag.
Have you a low altitude permit for that, buddy?
Leave? But he’s on a leash!
Your dog isn't fooling anyone
I'm not saying you can't fly him.  Just bring him down when he needs to go potty.
We were watching the parade on TV yesterday and he was jealous.
It’s my service dog!
Sir, please pick up after your kite.
The definition of kite does not include "best friend"
You know the rules. No dogs allowed  in the park!
I know it's a health hazard but Teddy would definitely approve!
Sir, two wrongs don't make a right.
A john there no flying dog in the park."

patrick mcguire waldorf ,m
Don't we have enough problems with bird poop in this park!
I don't care what he smoked, he's still a dog.
Eleanor made the rule: No flying dogs!
When we let you adopt an Airedale, we thought you had a little better understanding!
That's a bitching kite.
Is your dog vaccinated for rabies?
Fine by me, as long as it’s on a leash.
Sir, I need to inform you that if your dog drops it, you still need to pick it up.
Never mind what you fed your dog; people are complaining.
Would you like a poop bag or a rain hat?
This doesn't preclude you from picking up the droppings.
We lost ours a year ago, and we just aren't ready for another one yet.
We're practicing for the Thanksgiving Day parade.
Cop tickets Fido for barking for the wind
let's check that leash.
Mr. Pan, Wendy called to say this doesn’t count as walking the dog
Didn't you see the sign that said, Curb your Dog ?
Our kite running event is next Sunday
Well, you told me to put him on a leash.
I assume you'll clean up after him.
yes, it should fly better with a tail.
Did your balloon "go" before you launched it?
Your kite is different and it is scaring the other kites.."
O.K., but be sure to clean up after your kite!
It's very impressive sir, but it doesn't change my point that a dog pound isn't a measurement.
That's not a pitbull, it is?
Nothing to worry about, sir. He's had his shots.
You're starting to remind me of a guy I took in last week for flying a Bullwinkle.
How does that make America Great Again?
He's just gassy.
A tail does not make your dog a kite Sir, please bring it down!"
Kites have kite strings. Dogs have dog leashes. And yours exceeds 8 feet.
I can't even housebreak my dog.
You can't train your bird dog here.
If he poo poos while he's up there, it's on you.
Sir, if not a kite, you can only fly teddy bears here.
The dog has to leave,he is higher than a kite.
Look, I won't arrest you if he can get my Frisbee off the roof.
He always had high hopes.
Animal? What animal? Officer, I'm afraid you're mistaken. However that kite on my left looks a bit shady...
You wouldn't believe how many owners don't leash their pets.
He's just really good at fetch.
I'm sorry, Dogs aren't allowed in the Kite Park.
Sorry but you’ll need to fly that at the Trump Skeet and Balloon Park.
Inform your dog, this is an off -leash park.
I don't care if your dog is high as a kite. You're scaring the kids.
Sir I know his name is Kite but can you take him down.
Sir, trolling for eagles is prohibited.
You'll have to bring that down to 6 ft. or less.
You'll have to come with me sir. We don't allow dogs "off ground" in this city.
I'm just out flying my  Airedale Terrier. He is on a leash.
Don't worry, he's a rescue
The bargain brand doggy snacks are really gassy so, honestly, this is just his walkies.
Been feeding him El Perrito Burrito dog food?
Really? Helium as opposed to Health Chow, Sir?
You'll have to curb your dog, sir.
You're gonna clean up after that "kite", right mister?
Sorry, no dogs pumped up with helium. The ASPCA will complain.
I hope you brought your plastic bag...and a bullseye.
hey, pal: no subliminals allowed in public places.
Perhaps you missed the other sign, no dogs allowed.
Police dogs have dreams too, Joseph.
Sir, only flying squirrels are allowed inside. Please contact the manager for lifetime fox membership for 2 million
My father said I could buy a car when pigs fly. This dog was the closest thing I could get.
It's not mine. This is just until Carl gets back.
The other kites are housebroken.
Sir, please make sure the only thing your dog is doing up there is just flying.
Your Airedale is in violation of park rules.
it's a plane, it's a kite, it's a dog
What are you doing?
Best thing to do on a hot day.
Yeah mack, I know Labradoodles are 'all about fun' but c'mon!  Really?!
He feels like he’s top dog here.
Looks like someone is hoping for a lightning storm.
Please be sure to pick up after your kite.
Well, OK, as long as it's a comfort dog.
As long as you brought your pooper scooper there will be no problem.
You know this is a bird sanctuary
His name is Fala!
I agree, the squeaky bark is a riot, but the animal is still in distress.
The shelter said he is an Akite-a .
Sir, please fala me to the dog park
I don't care how good they are for his heart.
You'll have to live without your emotional support kite.
I’m arresting you for flying a kite while white
Sir, The Akita Park is down the way.
Has your "kite" been dropping "bombs"?
Sorry, Sir.  When I heard pigs were flying, I figured dogs could too.
Just who was it that told you to go fly a kite !
Why is this kite raw, and living?
Listen buddy, this is the Kite Park. The Dog Park is on Avenue A and the Dog-Kite Park is on Jefferson.
I hope you brought a real long scooper.
Thanks for leashing him, but the dog park is over there.
Sorry Sir, dogs are not allowed in the park.
Only Scottish terriers in this park! No Skye terriers
I’ll take a deep breath while you assume downward dog
I know it has a tail, sir. But it’s a dog.
Just a reminder to clean up the droppings.
This is a kite park,sir,not for pets.
Yes, we actually do issue flying dog permits....and tickets.
That's Mister Parkie to you!
Sorry, Sir, but I called Macy’s. They’ve never heard of you.
I understand you’re testing the limits of gravity and physics, but your dog is testing our patience by pooping over all the other park guests.
There have been complaints that you haven't been picking up after your kite.
Isn't this carrying a leash too far?
Don't feed him so many baked beans next time.
Can I see his license?
Sir, you are going to have to curb that dog.
So you're saying that your kite was born inside of a dog's body...
I wish I had a prize to give you.  I'm tired of these same old kites."
Your kite pooped on my hat!
No Sir, it's not allowed. Not even when the dog's name is Fala.
The 'No bad kites, only bad kite owners' excuse might work in other parks, but it won't work here.
My dog has been unusually gassy lately.
I hope you have your doggie bag!
Is his spirit animal a bird?
I understand, sir, but I still must ask you to lower him for inspection.
Sir, you're ruining people's waste of time.
No, don't worry officer, I don't need a bag, he is wearing a doggy diaper.
I'm sorry sir, but that dog just won't hunt...
How would you feel about me dragging a kite through the dog park?
Hydrogen or helium?
Sorry, no dogs, Mexicans, or coloreds allowed.
But his name is Teddy.
All dogs must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet.
I don't care if he's a service animal. Bring him down.
This is your final warning; your leash exceeds the legal allowance.
How do I tell these other guys there kites's are strange?
Until dogs quit peeing, the city ordinance says you can't fly them.
Dogs have to be on leashes, not string.
... and I'm telling YOU that city ordinace 1A14k clearly states ... "NO KITE SHALL BE FLOWN WITH BOTH
TAIL AND TOUNGE ARE VISIBLE"!
Yes sir, I can see he’s on a leash, but I’m still going to have to ask you to bring him down.
You know flying a Police Officer is a federal offense, right?
Kite park, not dog park!
It's too early for the Dog Days of summer, but I hear Macy's is previewing floats across the Park.
Dogs are only allowed between 6:00 and 7:30.
That's not funny.
You'll have to put him in the overhead bin.
Sorry, sir, but tail wagging the dog is not one of  Roosevelt's  Four Freedoms.
When the fur flies we kindly ask you to refrain from arguing with the other kite enthusiasts
My pig was busy today...
My name's Rufus. If you don't know how to do it 
I'll show you how to walk the dog.
It stressed me out; he's my service dog.
Don't try and deny it, sir, I saw you inflate that Chihuahua.
I'm sorry sir, but technically, that's not a leash.
Does he bite?
This would never work in "A Christmas Memory."
Clark and Krypto enjoy an afternoon in the park.
My airedale terrier-guide dog has greatly expanded my view.
Okay. But one 'pilot to bombardier' comment and you're both out of here
Fala like to fa-ly
Got any more helium?
Just be sure to pick up after your kite.
A couple of very angry picnickers would like you to clean up after your dog.
The saying is: 'When PIGS fly' ,not dogs.
I'm not saying he isn't free to be a bird, just that he needs to go to the bathroom before flying.
They were out of squirrels
We’ve had complaints about falling objects
Princes govern all things save the wind Bro?
Did you see a dog fly bye?
Is that why the meat is always so light and fresh?
Please tell Mitt this has to stop.
Nice try, Crampton.
Okay, you've got one minute to show me how it can jump over the moon.
I wasn't aware that there are guard dogs on the space station.
George, I don't want to hear about what millennia of unnatural selection has given us. I'm not helping you get her down from the tree again.
I don't care who you're friends with. No dogs allowed, Mr. Kent.
You're barking up the wrong breeze.
It's been quite a while since I've seen an Airedale. Is this her maiden flight?
Sir, there’s no use quibbling over semantics. Go fly a kite.
There are no new deals
Sir, please bring Roosevelt down.
What part of “No flying dogs allowed in the park” don’ t you understand?
No sir, you MUST wait for the Dog Days.
No Airedales, no Skye Terriers, no dogs! Period.
I ‘m sorry, sir, this is a kite park.  You’ll have to raise canine somewhere else.
Aerial dogfights are not permitted.
It wasn't diet food,  it was just a light snack
I'm sorry sir, but this is the Kite Park. The Dog Park is across the street.
Huh. Looks heavier.
Just hanging on till he coughs up Red Riding Hood, officer.
I'm sorry
Sir,  the regulations are clear!
You need to keep that dog on a shorter leash.
Did you get yours from Pet Smart?
“Should you dress to the  left Sir we have a panel beater in house “
 Lindsay Lloyd 
Christchurch 
 New Zealand
I was just taking him for a walk, but he is much lighter since we switched to his diet dog food.
Sir, people are saying his bark is worse than his kite.
Nice try pal. That's no leash.
Sir, do you have a permit?
Believe it or not, he's walking on air
I'm a huge fan of your animated movies, Mr. Anderson.
No unlicensed dogcatching allowed here, pal.
Animal kites are no longer allowed in the park.
Sir, this is a kite flying park. The dog flying park is down the street.
Sir, the dog park is a couple of blocks away.
Is that an Airedale?
Well, ok, but if he pees again we're gonna have a problem
Hey buddy, you need to curb your kite.
Keep your dog on the grass, pal.
Don't forget to pick up your poop.
I thought this was allowed during  the dog days of summer?
Just remember, you're responsible to clean up after him.
Sir, that is a Kit Fox....not a Kite Fox.  Bring it down.
Whether he's house-broken or not isn't the issue, Sir!
You're a witch.
"You better be sure he's already done his thing on the ground."
did you get that at dollarama or co-op
Sir,if your kite doesn't stop sniffing around the other kites' tails, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
No dogs on strings. Only on leashes.
As far as kite-fighting goes, my money's on you.
This was another one of Trumps many ways to waste the tax payers money...
OK, let me see this permit to fly helium-filled dogs then.
I’m going to have to ask everyone to leave. I can hear the clouds growling, and it feels like it’s starting to rain.
Dog-gone-it!
Yes, alternate side of the street barking rules apply in the park. And since it's Tuesday I'll be keeping my ears open.
Sir, the Advance Fetch Training is in the dog park
Some people just want to fly their kites without worrying about a hail of dog feces.
The flying part is OK. But when he discards ballast we  have a problem.
That's IT! I'm gonna have to issue you a citation for obstruction.
I'm sorry officer, he's not skybroken yet.
Sir, I've already asked that you keep him on a tight leash.
if you don't reel this in right now, you'll really see the fur fly!
Please remember to pick up after your dog.
Is he feeling gassy again?
Excuse me sir, but have you seen a watchdog on the grounds?
Dogma doesn’t like chasing down kites, pal.
That's a bit too much emotional support.
I see that he's on a leash and that he's always been a free spirit, but!
This is a kite park; pets are not permitted!
Did you hear that Lebron is going to LA?
Sir I'm afraid I 'll have ask if you are equiped 
with the proper 'doggie-do bag and baseball glove.
Sorry officer he insisted and he bloated after he ate the cake batter
You have to leave.  Your kite just pooped on Teddy's statue.
I believe he has his pilot's license.  He still needs a dog license.
Let me explain about the expression "dog fights".
It doesn’t matter what his name is. You and Kite have to go.
Well, some things don't float. I suggest a butterfly net.
What do I care? I'm just a janitor.
Airedale or not,it's against the rules....
Road kill kite? There are children here.
I'm sorry sir but if you are going to fly that kite, you must carry a zip lock plastic bag.
I don’t care if he is an A-kite-a. You can’t fly your dog in this park!
The dog is fine, but you need to add geometric shapes in color.
You may be "making lemonade" after she broke the helium tap, but it's still animal cruelty.
The fest of tails is at McAllister park not this one.
But my dog’s name is Teddy.
I don't care if you're promoting a brewery...get him down.
I've warned you before about playing with helium...
Yes, wearing a hat IS a good idea.
Sorry you'll have to show me its vaccination history.
It's pronounced "Kite," not "Kitty."
Its easier for him to fetch the higher branches this way
This is neither the place nor the time sir! Your dog must come down!
No dogs allowed not even Airdales.
You better rent one at the entrance.  PETA might get upset with this one.
Taking your literal approach to skirt the "no dog walking" ordinance to new heights, eh Phil? Well, the guy with the turd on his shoulder gave you up.
Impressive, but we still don't think he's a therapy dog.
Sir, yesterday when I said your dog had to be on a leash, this is NOT what I meant.
I checked, and you're right, it's legal. I still wish you'd stop, though.
Think you could help us with a raccoon problem in St. Paul?
You do see that this is a Kit-E park, don't you? No dogs allowed.
I'm afraid the rules are very clear,sir. You must also fly a para-scoop...
What’s the problem, he’s on a leash.
Whatever happens...you are responsible for cleaning it up.
Sir, I am going to have to ask for that kite’s citizenship papers.
This can hardly be called dog walking sir.
Sir, when I told you to pick up after your pet, I didn't quite mean this.
I'm sure it IS the bomb. It's also dropping bombs.
I don't understand officer.  He has a nose and a tail.
Yes, I know the other ones have tails too.
Sir, did you file a report for a missing kite?
It all started with a flying squirrel.
I don't see any bags - how are you planning on cleaning up after your kite?
I'm sorry sir only certified service kites are allowed here.
He tends to pass a lot of gas.
Does your pooper scooper protect against airborne projectiles?
What you’ve never seen a flying kangaroo before?
I'm afraid you need to leave. All the kids are scared to stand under it.
Mr. Roosevelt is not amused.
Sir, that’s not what they mean by “bird dog”
Officer, it's all about descending opinion.
And how do you plan to curb him this year, Mr. Davis?
Nope, not even a high-strung Airedale.
Well, technically, ...
Now, show me her papers.
Excuse me sir, I'm investigating a complaint about a dog eating a little boy's helium balloons here in the park.
I'm sorry, Mr. Pruitt, you can't fly endangered species in the park.
Your kite requires a diaper.
You didn't see the signs: "No dog flying"  here
Sir, have you been feeding your pet that dog food from China?
I realize that, sir; then again, most kites don't poop.
Yes - we have hats but some of the others are concerned.
If I let him off the leash he will fly away.
Sorry sir, but animals are not allowed in the park.
Sir, I'm afraid you exceed our new guidelines for being high as a kite.
New rules. No animals are allowed.
Yes, I see, but it's still a dog—dog park…NOW.
Dogs must be on a leash - not on a string.
You’re going to have to get that neutered, sir.
He is my service animal, who needs a very long leash . . . sometimes he just gets away from me!
It's not what your flying, it's the fact that you're not just here with a kid.
Sir, it's illegal to inject a live animal with helium!
Sir, you want the Westminster Kite Park.
If that dog hits the ground, you're under arrest.
Sir, I hope you brought an umbrella.
She’s always been full of hot air - at least now I can put her to some good use.
It doesn’t matter no dogs are allowed
May the Fox Be With You
Clever... How much helium did you need to use?
I don't care if he can fly, no dogs allowed in the park.
Do you have enough helium, sir
Sorry, Sir,  dogs must be on a leash in the kite park.
Excuse me, sir.  Didn't you see the sign: no dogs allowed?
Is that kite trained to assist you?
Advanced bird dog training you say? ...
I'm going to find that damn dog of yours if it's the last think I do.
A lease.  Not a kite string, a lease.  That's the law.
This situation could easily turn into Pearl Harbor.
I'm multitasking.
That’s a doggone nice kite you’ve got there.
That kite belongs at the dog park
I'm going to need you to keep a tight leash on his exuberance.
This event is going to the dogs.
Sorry sir, but all dogs must be on a leash.
I'll need to see its license and vac tags.
Why, sir, were you parked in the handicap spot?" "I swear my dog has polio.
Sir, it's a kite park, not a bite park
I don’t care if it is a Skye terrier, sir.
But he said it was legal now to go to the park and get high...
Vicious kites must remain leashed at all times.
There’s a report of an owner who’s not cleaning up his pet’s business.
Don't you know height stroke kills pets?
Thanks for holding on to him for me.
He thought it'd be easier to bark at the birds from up there
Lucky for you Teddy was an animal preservationist.
Sir, I’m going to have to report you for animal abuse. You can only keep your dog high or dry.
I’ve heard of a dog-kite, but this is ridiculous!
From up there I know it’s difficult to tell where it’s going to land, but try to pick up after your dog!
Sir, technically he’s still in the park.
A few people have complained about some acid rain.
Dog park is next door."
You can avoid being cited if you provide protective head gear to the others.
The Dog Park was great, but he likes this one better.
It's not raining, and you have to curb your dog anyway.
I dont care if he is a pure breed.
Bring him down cause he's nothin' but a ground dog.
We have a report you are abusing the leash law
I'm not sure the SPCA is going to like this one.
We have a leash law.  String doesn't count.
I'm pretty sure there is *some* ordinance on this.
Sir, there is a reason that dogs should not be fed beans!
Sir, where’s your blue baggy?
It used to be part of our doggie dancing routine, until he decided to cut the cord and launch his own business.
So what if you named him Roosevelt Kite, this isn't the dog park.
May I see your dog's pilot's licence?
He's always had a lot of gas.
I know, I forgot the poop bags again.
No, it isn't raining.
It doesn't make any difference. There are still no dogs allowed in the park.
Pigs don't fly.. Got it?
I don't care if it is a Roosevelt terrier.  It's against the law to fly dogs.
The Big Bad Wolf, huh?
We have complaints that you're not picking up after your pet.
I'll have to ask you to leave. It appears your dog is higher than a kite.
And how do you suggest to collect his poop?
I don't care if your kite tail wags. No dogs allowed.
Sorry, Mr. Fox isn't coming to London.
Ok, sure, you've got her on a leash this time.  I'm still going to have to give you a citation.
No sir, he ain't magical. He just got into the edibles, is all.
Mr. Morgan, you are under arrest for the theft of the missing Red Bull truck"
Yeah,the Roosevelts were big dog lovers. And that looks just like Sailor Boy.
Sorry, you can't fly your dog here, kites only.
GENTLEMAN YOU FLY KITE NOT NON VEG TEMPTATION
No, that's not what 'endangered' means.
Sir, the dogs must be flown below the kite altitude.
Where you at 11:00 A.M. on Thanksgiving Day?
Sir, you know you're going to have to clean up after it.
OK, just as long as there are no droppings!
I don't care if it has a tail. It's still not a dirigible.
I’m sorry sir, but dogs aren’t allowed in the Park
Sir, didn't you see the Tweet that this dog park was sold to the Roosevelt Kite Company?
The “Go fuck yourself park “ is two blocks over and always crowded.
How long did that road kill have to dry before it would fly?
You  need a longer tail.
There's only so much creativity that we will tolerate here.
Sir! Please stop giving helium to your dog!
This is a non-denominational kite park.
Someday Jeff you're just going to have to let your dog go...
I know: Amazing.  But the complaints are that when he gets excited he pees a little.
He asked for it!
I don’t care if his name is Kite, Mr. Roosevelt.
You need to take your boxer kite to the dog park!
So you expect me to believe this was his idea?
Sir, you know it's illegal to get your dog high.
Concededly, the text does not expressly exclude it. However, if one considers the framers' manifest intent, Mr. Chief Justice, . . . .
Sir I don’t make the rules, I just enforce ‘em. Please take your kite to the “Non-standard Kite Area” of the Park.
Do you have a license for that kite sir?
Sorry sir, but the park had to outlaw stupid pet tricks after Letterman went off the air.
Don’t you think it’s time to bury Fala?
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to keep your dog on the grass.
Just be careful- my cat is getting jealous.
You have to clean up your kite's poop
Please curb your dog this time!
Skye terrier or no Skye terrier, you still have to pick up after your dog, sir.
Why are you dogging these kite flyers?
What's your dog's name?
And just how are you planning to pick up after it?
Sir- Sir, your kite is barking.
I understand you're protesting the conversion of the Dog Park.
Don't worry, he's a flying Spaniel.
Didn't I cite you last week for jogging your kite on the dog run?
I believe the song is lets go fly a kite, not a cat.
I'm sorry to bother your sir, but you're gonna have to curb that thing.
How many times do I have to tell you.  Take Fala to the dog park!
What's The name of your veterinarians taxidermist?
Is he housebroken?
That's not what I meant by having him on a leash.
Sir, this is Roosevelt Kite Park, not Underdog Dog Park.  Float along, sir, float along.
Your kite seems very life-like!
What's the lil guy's name?
Feel free to unleash your dog. With the recent budget cuts, we’ve had enough trouble as is enforcing the kites-must-be-kept-on-string policy.
Sorry sir, I don’t care if he floats. You have to walk him at Dog Beach.
A few people complained you are not picking up after your dog, and  others are getting hit on the head with it.
We received complaints that your kite is scaring the other kites
When I said you needed more tail I didn't mean a real one!
No, Sir, I have not read your new book entitled  "How To Get Your Dog High on Bird Seed Alone."
So last week you were walking your kite at the dog park...........  and now this !!
I'm warning park users to be looking out for coyotes.
I served with Fala.  I knew Fala.  Sir, that kite is no Fala.
Just be sure to keep it on the leash.
what are you feeding your dog?
Yours is a kite that will live in infamy
It's not breathing. It's the wind.
The dog park is next door and you won't need a leash!
Please hold on tight, sir, this isn't an off-leash park.
A flatulent pet is not considered to be a kite, even it soars
I may not be able to prove you stole that helium tank, 'sir,' but the Roosevelt Kite Park police force is watching you.
That ain't no Fala, ain't even a Scottie, and it ain't no kite, so reel it in and get it the hell out of here.
'Sir, I must ask you to let me fly your kite.'
You may need to give it another tail.
Sir, jackets are not allowed.
Maybe next time go easy on the beans.
The on-leash-off-ground area is near the trees.
Just make sure you clean up after your pet.
Having a nose and a tail does NOT make him a kite!
I’d say your cheating
What work or task has this dog been trained to do for you?
He must have picked up tailwind.
Sir,real dogs aren't used in dogfighting
Your leash is too long.
I don't care if he's an airedale."
Sir, do you know anything about the complaints people have of rain on this sunny day?
Which part of "kite" did you miss?
Got it at Pro Kites. It came with a free RUMP / DENCE T-Shirt?
Is your kite toilet-trained?
Dogfights are against Park rules.
Let sleeping dogs fly?
Sir, your dog is impressive but I need you land it.
Is that a labradoodle?
Sir, this is legal only if you provide umbrellas for everyone present.
I know he's retired, but Polly's in trouble.
I'll need to see your pooper scooper please.
Curb your kite.
Did you bring a pet waste bag?
It's the dog days of summer model.
Please take Air Bud to a dog park.
You still got to clean up after him.
Your dog is full of hot air? There's another way to handle it!
Excuse me we are doing a random survey, can I mark you as a Trump Republican?
I said the only way he could win is if dogs could fly!
Sorry sir this park is for kits only, you'll have to go to the dog park.
Sorry sir, but it doesn't matter if his park is worse than his kite.
We got a call about some carrier pigeons going missing.
And I thought that my dog was gassy!
On behalf of other park patrons, please keep an eye on where he relieves himself.
Technically, Sir, that is not a leash.
That is a dog, not a kite.
That's a violation. The tail is too short!
It is not about the leash law. It is about the droppings.
First day pot's legal, he eats my stash!
 Just waiting for him to come down, Officer.
No, it's not illegal, but I am required to tell you that you're deplorable.
It’s a Labirdoodle.
Sir, the Roosevelt Dog Park is on the other side of town.
You know that's illedog
Mickey made me do it.
You're not fooling anyone, you know!
I don't care how high your dog gets on acid, he's still a dog, not a kite.
Don’t forget his flu shot!
Sir, string does not count as a leash.
Hope you know that FDR would not have approved
'I can tell that you're high right now.'
I don't care if you had him for 14 years. It's still creepy as hell.
Yes, asshole, I have heard of the 1st amendment, but for God's sake, there are children here!
I'm from the FAA. You're flying that dog without a license.
Under our zero tolerance policy, I'm impounding this hedgehog unless it's willing to assimilate.
Jones, ASCPA
This is the third time, Mr. Bates.
Flying pooch does not mean anything to me. Dog park is next door.
Excuse me, but do you have a license for that kite?
Sorry, I still need to write you up for not curbing your pet.
Did you NOT see the sign--"no dog kites allowed"??
That's a dog.
It's a service animal.
Nice kite. Do you know where I could buy one of those?
You  can't  practice for the Macy's parade here.
Well no, it's not specifically mentioned in the regulations. Even still...
excuse me sir, but is that your dog?
That dog don't hunt.
When did your dog start chasing kites?
We've had reports about leftists hanging out around here, so keep a sharp eye out -they're hard to spot.
Well if you do see the person who helped Fido escape please let us know.
You know the rules, Koons, reel him in.
Sir, there are no dogs allowed in the park.
Dogs do get gas, it's true.
Lucky may very well be in his element but you still have to clean up after him
Its a Lamb in a wolfs’ skin
Quick Draw is looking for Snuffles - has your dog seen him?
No, that sign say kitty park.
Sir, you need to ask yourself: "What would Cesar Millan do?"
Who names a female dog after a president?
Sir, I hope that's helium and not hydrogen.
You need a dedicated permit to fly a dog.  Ah, and a doggie diaper.
I assume Roosevelt gets his sense of humor from you?
He's an old dog, it's a new trick,
 but one turd bomb, he's done.
Didn't you see the sign? No dogs allowed.
We've had reports that your kite is, um.......pooping on others in the park.
Sorry sir, but this is a kite Park not a dog park
But, officer, he's on leash-- just like the sign says.
I'm sorry, but the sign says "No Dogs Over the Grass"
I don't care if it is a therapy dog, it's still not permitted
I got the idea from Ray Bradbury.
Cannabis oil cured his ailments? Great. But the dog park is two blocks east.
I don't care if you're "blind" and "just looking around," this is a kite park.
This is exactly why kite parks always have leash laws.
OK,so it's a leash but what about the pooper-scooper regulation?
Mister, you're not allowed to fly your dog in this park!
Do you have a license to fly?
I know it's just a kite sir, but any dog is still prohibited in the     park ."
Whats the problem officer, he's an Airedale.
Today, I’m going to let it slide. Tomorrow, there’d Better be a leash.
Well, Fido always wanted to fly, so after he died I made him into a kite for him to realize that wish.
Just don’t let him fly over my cruiser.
I am aware, Sir, that he is an Airedale, but you still can't fly him here.
Where were you able to find such a long leash?
It’s ok - he is potty trained.
Even if it counts as a leash you still have to pick up after him!
Interesting use of aerodynamics to break that tail chasing habit.
Thank you for keeping your dog on leash.
Sir, I'm going to have to impound your kite for its lack of stripes. A cat would've done a better job.
So you're saying somebody told you to 'Go fly a schnauzer'?!
It’s an emotional support companion. I have a certificate.
I'll let you slide on the leash if you promise he won't go to the bathroom.
Look, I've never heard of Kite-idermy, but I'm pretty sure you still need a permit.
It says 'Kite Park', not 'Dog Park'.
Sorry, sir, but absolutely NO DOGS allowed in the park!
Reminder Sir that you need to keep your kite on leash all times.
I think you'll find he's on a leash.
Sorry sir, but you'll have to put your kite-dog away unless you put a diaper on it.
Just make sure you obey the leash law at all times.
Any flown pets must wear diapers
Sorry, Governor Romney--dogs not allowed in the park!
Zlatni Rat Kiting is Not Allowed in this Park.
He may be a free spirit, but leash laws assume your dog will be on the ground.
No, it’s not illegal.  But we’re all concerned as to how you’ll curb him.
Sir, is that a service kite?
I know, it's easier than walking him.
May I see your poop bag?
Sorry but no dogs allowed without a poop bag.
Please keep your dog under control.
Go leash a kite.”
Well he swallowed a helium balloon, I just thought we'd make the most of it.
Sorry, no dogs allowed. Not even on a leash.
We provide poop bags at the gate.
It’s his punishment for getting into the trash.
I saw your taxidermy ad on the bus, do you do rabbit kites?
He needs a shorter leash.
I'm sorry, sir, it's also illegal to fly yourself over the border with a kite.
He may be getting a bit too much fiber.
Sir, we have a park rule, Dogs need to be on a leash.
That had better be an Airedale.
Girl or boy?
I said it’s a leash free zone. Now, let him go.
Have you seen the Trump Baby Balloon?
Sir, we have received numerous complaints that you kite has been trying to mark its territory all over the field.
I need you to move it to the Kite Bark.
No dogs fly on my watch without valid emotional support certificates.
This is the year of the dog, bud. Save the rat for 2024.
Sorry sir, your leash needs to be 10 feet or less.
Sir, we found a steamroller licensed in your name.
Sir, the Dog Days of summer are over. I'm going to have to ask you to release that dog.
I'm sorry, sir. This park is for kites only. You can fly your dog down the road at Helium Park.
Pardon me sir, but is that really R. Kelley’s dog?
I suppose you have a license for this?
That kite scares me!
When he stops huffing and puffing, you really will need to take him down
How the hell did you get that raccoon to sign the waiver?
While this is a unique way to curb your dog, your fellow kite fliers may disagree.
I'm just glad Teddy isn't here to see this...
You can't fool me--that's a drone.
Sorry sir but the dog park is one block down.
Sorry sir!  I thought this was the dog park.
so you've decided to go along when Google said "Did you mean: coyote park?"
Hey buddy I told you NO DOGS ALLOWED!
Excuse me sir...we do not allow our kite flyers to wear caps.
is that a KiteKat?
I don’t care if he’s on a leash, it’s still no dogs allowed!
Witnesses say it was your dog that ate the helium canister that belonged to the balloon vendor. Any truth to that?
She met the nicest family of robins the last time she chased a squirrel.
Sir, we have had multiple complaints about Buddy's aerial dumps and request that you fly him elsewhere.
You need supplemental  kite insurance.
Sir, all dogs must be on a leash 6 feet or less.
Your kite cannot be on a leash that is longer than 6 feet.
Is that Donald's soul!
The sign out front clearly states no aggressive kites.
Has he ever seen Gone With The Wind?
Sorry, sir. Even if his name is Teddy.
Is that a registered certified leash?
Dog's a dog, pal.
Would mind if I took a photo? my wife loves Airedales.
Your dog really is in the park
and you know it's not allowed.
Your kite left quite a mess in the takeoff area.
For the last time, you're not allowed to exhume Skip and fly him over the President's park.
I honestly thought I was in the dog park.
Why? Because I'm a cat-kite person, that's why!
Just to clarify, sir, your dog is very much not exempt from the pick-up law.
Yes Sir, I did check the regulations. Helium filled dogs are not allowed in the kite park. You’ll have to sail your Schnauzer in the dog park.
Hightail it out of here.
Well...OK...as long as he's on a leash...!
I’m afraid feral kites are not permitted here.
The coyote is nor bird nor flag, sir. You are disqualified.
Where’s your orange vest, sir?
Be sure to pick up the droppings
Sir, this is not what Roosevelt would have wanted at his kite park.
He's a WWI Aviation buff.  Call him Fast Eddie.
Set her down or I'll cite you for pooching
Can you do a pig?
I'm sorry, but I said your parole would be over when pigs fly. Nice try though.
Sir, you need a collar with that leash.
Park rules require pets to be licensed and vaccinated for dragon energy.
You’ll have to leave. A kite string does not qualify as a leash.
What breed?
Please pick up after him.
Flying squirrels requires a permit.
The dog park is across the street.
No, it's not like a bird, you still have to clean up after it.
That's a string, not a leash.
No dogs allowed here.
Sure you can fly your dog here but you have to yell incoming if you need to pick up.
I just couldn't get it to fly until I put a tail on it.
We like to keep the animals on the ground here.
No, sir, technically, that is NOT a leash.
I don't care if he IS a service animal.
Technically, sir, your dog is not on a leash.
Is it potty trained?
You had better catch it before it hits the ground or else!
We started Bowser on a new flea medication. It stopped the itching but makes him higher than a kite.
Nice try, but you still have to pick up after him.
Your dog peed on one of the kites. Please let it fly in the dog park.
Sir, a helium-dog is against the rules
No alcohol, no music, no pets.
Leave now.  Pets are not allowed here!
Dog gone it, that's not the way to walk your dog.
Sir, the dog park is two blocks to the West.
There's a law against testing the wind?
somebody" in Korea wanted him for dinner
Off-leash hours started at 5 if you'd like to bring him down.
Sir, you'll need to go to the dog park.
No, sir.  There is no space for ‘other’ types of kites.
Hand it back, sir. This is now the Trump kite park, and we don't give flying rat's asses anymore.
Fala la la la, bring it down!
I realize it’s a flying fox, sir, and obviously you’re following the leash laws, but...
Sorry sir, but in this park all kites have to be of the same origin. It's a new immigration law.
I'm the one who'll have to clean up when that gassy dog explodes, that's who.
Above or on the ground, you still need a pooper scooper in the park.
Sorry, Sir. No dogs allowed.
HOW DID YOU GET HIM TO DO THAT?
Just be on the lookout. He responds to 'Cooper' and the family is worried sick.
Yes, I understand it was the burrito he had for lunch, but I'm still asking you to leave and take your kite with you
Please tell me he is potty trained.
It’s cheaper than boarding him in a kennel.
I got this kite for 50% off.
It's not a leash and as soon as he lands, you get a ticket.
And you would scoop his poop how?
Quite the rough rider you got there.
They can fly anything they want That clown David Remnick is still here!!
Don't worry officer.  His bark is worse than his bite.
A new use for light and airy dog food?
psst ... what type of knot works best for that?
You had better be using helium. Hydrogen is banned.
Sorry sir, the dog days of kite flying are only allowed in Hoover park.”
I assume you're the one ordered the helium tank?
Just be sure to keep it on a tight leash.
Let me guess, it's your seeing eye dog and you're just taking a look around the park
Sorry, but it's not a kite.
Sorry, but your doggie poop bag leaves a lot to be desired.
Your wife says to walk your dog, not fly it.
It's a pet flying squirrel, he likes to show off.
He walks first . . .  then he can fly!
I'ts not technically a leash, so......
I see sir you have a Roosevelt Terrier. Please keep him leased when you bring him down.
I understand that the car window was no longer enough for him, but you can't just fly him around the park whenever it's windy.
Sir, the dog flying park is three blocks over
Sir, flying dogs are the next park over
No dogs or independent voters allowed.
Excuse me sir, but the Dumbo Animal Park is the next block over.
But sir, that's his favorite park.
I don't care what his name is. This is a dog-free flight zone.
You need to keep your dog on a four foot leash in this park.
Sir, you don't want to make me call in the Cloud-9 unit.
Float your balloon, between the boat and whatever. 

Go
Sir, there are no dogs allowed in the kite park!
No dogs allowed, sir, even if they can fly.
Yes it might be the cartoonist’s understanding of a “flying fox”but it’s not allowed in this park.
The dog park is one block west of here.
Keep him on a shorter leash — I don't want him scaring the other kites.
Okay now, check all of the kites for contraband.
No dogs on the grass, wadda you tryin to pull?
The Up Dog Yoga event is in a different section of the park.
Sir,  absolutely no dogs allowed unless they are leashed.
Personally, I believe that Teddy actually meant “Ruff” Riders.
Her exuberance created such a stir amidst the other dogs that we decided this park was a better fit."
Janice Resnick, Rochester, N.Y
I hear you are an excellent dog trainer.
There's a neuter rule in this park, too.
We've had complaints that you're chasing tails.
I'm going to need you to take that doggone thing down right now, sir.
I don’t care what tricks she can do you still have to stoop and scoop.
I don’t care if you call it Airedale, this breed won’t fly.
I'm sure he eats better than you do, sir, but it's still a public safety concern.
Sorry sir, we enforce a six-foot leash law in this park.
Can you help me with a pet that keeps lying on the couch?
I think they said "sight hound".
I don't care if it is the year of the dog, you can't fly it without a permit.
Excuse me sir, you are standing in an ant pile.
Perfect for the dog days.
He was sulking after we started closing the toilet lids, so now we do this to perk him up.
No problem, just keep him on-string.
I don’t care if it’s the year or the rat.
His name is Air Bud, maybe you’ve heard of him.
I'm guessing your dog really isn't named 'Kite'.
Sir, you're under arrest for gross indecency, aggravated rape, and possession of heroin with intent to distribute.  Oh, and flying a dog-shaped kite without a license also.
I’m sorry sir, but the New York Leash Law explicitly states that “Dogs in public must be on a leash no more than 6 feet long.”
Listen Bomgarden, I said to clear Fido for final approach to the dog park.
Do you have a license for that?
It's the tail. It's better. Stronger.
I don't care if he has a tail, that's still not a kite.
I can see he’s got a tail. That don’t make him a kite. The dog park’s across town.
The dog kite park is in Washington.
No, I can’t make you go to the dog park but you better be good with the poop bag.
Well, at least you didn't break the leash law.
Excuse me sir, this is a kite park. You'll have to bring 'er down.
Helium!!! That is a strange name for a dog
Sir, it’s PARK with a KITE, not DOG in the FIGHT.
Your dog is higher than a kite!
I'll need to see his distemper papers.
Yes George, I know you just taught him how to fly, but he keeps chasing the other kites around.
It's an Airedale Terrier, not an Air-dale.
It’s supposed to be just a tail, not the whole animal!
Sir, I can assure you there's no dog flying or my name isn't Roosevelt  Kite!
No, Ben Franklin didn't tell me to do it.
He is my emotional support dog.
Sorry, buddy, but only kites and flying squirrels allowed here.
I thought the saying said Pigs fly?
How’d you get him up there?
Could you, please, expand your dog’s horizon elsewhere.
Hey, buddy, no dogs allowed.
You were smart not to clip your pup’s tail.
Excuse me sir, but I believe that President  Roosevelt  stipulated 
that Wildlife  be flown only in the National Parks.
Sir, the 'K' in K-9 isn't for kite
My dog likes to relax after a tough night. He works as a guard dog at the Flying Dog Brewery  - you see.
Only in the Windy City.
Sir, all dogs must be in your control and on a 6 ft leash
I thought I told you - no dogs aloft.
Yes, we're sure it was pee...
That's right sir.  No dogs at the park, not even in the airspace!
You need a license to fly a kangaroo, sir
It doesn't look like a pig but it still flies.
I don't see a problem with it.
Your dog's name better be "KITE".
You’re flying a mutt without a permit, bud.
I hope you have a pooper scooper.
Dog license and waste butterfly net, please.
I am expressing my Rights under one of the Constitutional Amendments to fly whatever flag I like.
Sir, it doesn't matter if you clean up after "Lucky," by then it will be too late. That's why no dogs allowed.
I thought this was a dog park too!
Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to move over to the Roosevelt Dog Park.
There’s a dog park for that.
Sir, dogs have to be on a leash, not on a string.
That is clearly not a leash...
Nothing like some doggie flatuance.
Leashes can't be more than 6 feet long!
Sir, the FAA require all dogs be on leash when in their airspace.
So what are we all supposed to do when he decides to relieve himself?
You know, I'd bust you in a minute if there was a law against getting pets high.
Sir, I am going to have to ask you to curb your dog.
No clothes, no fly.
Sir, I don’t care if his name is Teddy, all dogs must be on a leash.
Sir, this is the Teddy Roosevelt Kite Park. Exotic taxidermy only.
We are quite strict about remaining on leash at all time, yes.
Around here we allow only four freedoms.
Sorry, even though it’s an Airedale you have to move to the dog park
Let me down! I thought he said Bite Park, not Kite Bark.
I'm afraid fetch is not allowed, sir.
Excuse me, sir. We’re now asking flying pet owners to use the clearing over the knoll.
But officer, he’s been fixed.
I too love to fly kites. I'm sure you have a beautiful kite, but due to the brim of my hat, I am unable to see it. This leaves me blissfully unaware of the surreal horrors of our world. Want to grab a drink?
Yeah, well what if I don't believe in flying dogs. . .?
Sir, "the dog days of summer' is a figure of speech
2018 ... am I right?"
Did he have a rabies shot?
We do not allow animals to fly here, even service animals
Sir, the dog park is on the other side of the hill.
Excuse me Mr. Roosevelt, but Fala is once again 'sprinkling while tinkling'
Dog Park is other side of the road behind you.
Well at least it isn't a check.
Sir, I am going to need documentation as proof that this is an emotional support dog.
I know, I know. Thanksgiving Day Parade dreams die hard.
Sir, the little boy would like his drone back.
You dog just pooped on the mime.  He's either pressing charges or doing his man-in-box routine.
Sir, we're going to have to know how you got the helium in there.
May I pet him?
Hey Pal, I don't see a license on that kite.
Democratic Socialists of America. Ocasio-Cortez & Company are air-lifting red lipstick to Venezuela. In return they are receiving stock certificates from Petróleos de Venezuela and recipes for Pabellón Criollo. Viva la Revolucion.
Flying dogs not allowed here.  You want the BITE park.
Airedales for adoption kite !
Sir, there are no animals allowed in the Kite Park. 
Take that to the Roosevelt Dog Park.
Sorry, Bub, no leash, no fly.
And I assume you're prepared to pick up after him?
Look, I found this in the sand next to some sleeping people
Did you even read the design regulations? You probably don't have a license either.
Since when did Airbud give up basketball?
Sorry to bother you sir but I'm looking for a missing dog. He's brown, kind of scruffy and likes to jump a lot. Have you seen him"

"Um, no.  Sorry officer."
Uh, sir, I'm going to need you to get him down from there.
There's an electrical storm coming." 
"That's OK. His name is Ben Franklin."
Yes -- it's impressive, but you still need to use the dog park.
It's an impressive Downward-Facing Dog, but yoga is not permitted here.
Sir, we permit frying hot dogs not flying hot dogs.
I get it, but he showered the hot dog stand with pee.
Is that the wind, or your kite howling in terror?
Sir, I must remind you of our 'No Pets' park policy.
Sorry sir, despite its name, an airedale terrier is not technically a kite.
Sir, we've received complaints that your kite is flying through traffic.
‘You’re in violation of the law of physics for flying a non-aerodynamic dog-kite!’
Don't make me have to write and propose legislation to the city council against what you are doing.
Yes; but that’s not a leash, OK?
Sorry. No shirt, no kite.
I told you last time to bring a proper kite.
Excuse me, sir, but dog-flying is restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays only.
Are you the guy who was walking a kite yesterday?
The saying goes, "When PIGS fly"
Looks like someone gave his dog too much of Wonka's fizzy lifting drink.
I'm afraid that tail is not regulation length.
You can't tell me it's a bird, or it's a plane. Now pick up the poop!
Sir, the dog flying park is on Governors Island.
The animal helium balloon park is across the street.
Hey Mister! Keep your dog on a 6 foot leash!
Park rules: animals can be shot at, but not flown.
Sorry, I forgot the dog park key code.
We're getting complaints from people who walk under it.
Let me guess-  He's an Airedale.
You're not fooling anybody, sir.
What's it full of? Heelium?!
Mr. Pan, you and Nana are under arrest for distribution, I hope the high was worth it"
- Pixie dust, not even once
Is his name Kite?
I think it would be best if you requested a 'Down, boy.'
No, it doesn't matter that it's an Airdale!
I know it's not a kite, it's an Akita
You'll clean it up, right?
You'll need to pick up after him you know.
Sorry, but the competition is for domesticated kites only.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to identify the flying object.
Find somewhere else to teach him to fly.
Sir, there are no dogs aloud on the lawn.
The sign said, “Don’t walk on the grass!”.
You shouldn't let in non-union kite flyers.
I'm calling it in—we got a canine on cloud nine.
Just be glad he's on leash.
But he's an Airdale, officer.
Can he fetch?
Sir, there's a big enough problem here with bird poop.  We don't need to worry about falling dog poop, too.
Actually, the complaints are about hunger.
Um, Hi. I'm Bob. You fly him here often?
Nothing much, dog, what's up with you?
Helium filled dogs aren't legitimate kites.
Fast food?  Just caught on this train!
Very clever, but you know we don't allow dogs to chase birds here.
No, a balloon with a tail is NOT a kite.
Airedales can only be flown in the dog park.
Your ironic take on aerodynamics is upsetting the others.
Fala needs her service dog vest to fly in the park.
I understand his name is Kite, but dogs are still not allowed here.
You shouldn't send a dog out on a kite like this.
No dog flying allowed!
I’m sorry sir, but this is a dog free park.
You having a ruff day?
Excuse me, sir. Have you tried tweeting Kellyanne Conway for a better way to get rid of all that 'hot air'? She's an expert at it.
You have to stop your kite's marking territory. It's raining down on other kiters
There have been some concerns that your kite is rabid.
Please tell me he's housebroken.
Sir, that's not what we meant by 'leash.'
He always wanted to know how it's like to fly.
I don't care if it has a tail, No Balloons allowed.
That’s what you said last time.
Your dog must be an airedale.
Think of it as animal spirits.
He's a rescue dog and he needed a "new deal."
I told him it’s not pronounced “kitty,” but he wouldn’t listen.
Ever since I let him inhale a balloon, he's become addicted to it."
if you made it a little bit unique it would stand out more.
We feel you violate the spirit of the leash law.
I am looking for a dog that attacked the balloon man's inventory.
What? This is what we do to rats in my neighborhood."
Yeah, not a "must happen all the time" situation.
"That's not a pig"
Andrew, Andrew, Andrew... Is the dog at least dead this time?
Great kite just don’t fly it over my lawn!
My dog won't even walk in the park
Forgive me. Please clean up after your "kite".
Explain to me how are you going to scoop the poop?
Your creativity does not exempt you from following the park's "No Pets Allowed" policy.
Sir, I’m going to have to ask you all to rein in kites and dogs.
The tail needs to be a little longer
The judge said you will need more then this for him to change his mind.
We were promised flying cars.
You didn't read the park rules, did you.
I don’t care sir, a helium filled canine is still not a kite
I said heel him
I understand he's a Levitator Retriever, but he has the unpleasant habit of marking his territory.
What?... it's a teddy raccoon
Whoever said  'go fly a dog?' "
I don't care if he does like it, he still can't fly here!
Well Officer, at least it’s not a pig!
Sorry, Officer.  He thinks he is a sky(e) terrier.
Sir, your dog is welcome in this park. But a diaper is required while airborne.
I know he's enjoying it Sir, but this is not the Dog Park and a kite string is definitely not a leash!
Bring him down!  His drool is interfering with the rice paper.
No I haven't, but looks to me like a defect in the leash...
This ain't China, please lower your dog Sir
Please instruct your kite to stop eating the other kites.
People have been complaining about yellow rain.
Sir, please. He's breaking wind all over the park.
That is not a leash.
That's some tail!
It's a hot dog
Have you tried changing his diet?
You still have to curb your dog !
Sorry sir, no leashes longer than 6 feet.
Yes sir, it’s quite impressive that your dog can fly but regulations require that he do his business on the ground only.
I’m glad he’s leashed. Still, it’s not a dog park.
If he does you have to clean it up.
It's only allowed if you fly a hydrant next to him.
Sir, I don't care if he is an airedale.
This is an off-leash park, sir.
The dog park is next door, sir.
Just make sure you have enough poo bags buddy.
SORRY,TOU HAVE TO GO TO THE DOG PARK
What, Officer? The sign says dog must be on leash.
No leashes longer than six feet sir.
Hey buddy, this park is only for kites that looks like a kite.
You're going to have to get a proper leash.
Yes really. Our leash laws are very specific.
A kite string is not a leash!
Yes, he is an Airdale.  Why do you ask?
Well I'm pretty sure it wasn't one of the other kites that left that back there in the grass and you're going to have to pick it up.
I'm concerned about what happens after the dog lifts.
„Sorry, only non-pooing kites allowed.“
My chiropractor recommended it!
There's nothing to fear.
This is a traditional Kite Park, animal kites are not allowed
Sorry, bud, no pets allowed.
No... I need to see you F.A.A. license.
I didn't ask if he was a rescue.
Sure don't look like a kite to me!
No problem at all, sir. I'll just need to see your service dog documentation.
Very innovative, but this only highlights the need for you to do this at  the dog walking park.
The dog park is five blocks from here.
Either you leave the park or put a leash on your dog. No exceptions.
Sorry. No dogs allowed here at any time.
Sir, I could tolerate a kitty
That's a fucked up thing to do to a dog, fam.
We've had complaints about droppings.
Sir, you'll have to use the dog fly in the south end of the park.
I'm sorry sir, the wind really kicks up here in the afternoon.
I'm high as a kite.
'Sorry sir, but the Trump Kite Park is about a half mile further.
Have you never walked your dog vertically?
Bernoulliese Mountain Dog, I presume?
Clearly, you stole our animal and are pretending it is a kite.  Stop wasting my goddamn time and give me the poorly drawn animal.
Yes.  He is solar powered
please don't tell me your dog is high as a kite
Sir, this is Airedale abuse.
No, sir. The one in the wheelchair.
Your kite just dropped a dukie!
He's an AireDale Terrier
This isn't about the leash, it's about what he's dropping.
Get with it Officer. He's a kite and I'm twelve.
You can’t be horsing around like that”

“It’s a fox
What? It's a free country.
I don't care if his name is "Kite".
Ticks and fleas are okay, but this is a no fly's zone
Can you please bring it down before it urinates.
You have to fly your dog at the dog park.
Sir, are you aware this is not the Trump Kite Park?
Do you have a dog license to fly that thing?
We've had some complaints about the pooping.
Sir, what you're doing is in violation of that animal's rights.
Sorry, sir, but it is definitely pronounced A-keet-ta
No more warnings. I need you to recognize the importance of bringing a poop bag in this situation.
Have you seen my german Shepard and a tank of helium?
Sorry, you will have to leave, Roosevelt didn't like dogs
Keep him on his leash
Sir, do you own a Kia Sorento?
I'm sorry, sir -- no wolves allowed.
But Officer, this is a leash.
The sign says, Kite Park, you moron! If that wolf pisses on on one more person I'm going personally punch you stupid!
Sir,park rules state that your dog must be on a leash!
I'll have what he's having.
I'm afraid your airedale still belongs in the dog park, sir.
And if he poops?
Don't fail to clean up after him.
Stop yelling bombs away. This is a poop free zone.
Nice try, but he's got to go.
You will be in big trouble after that dog farts.
You still need a pooper scooper.
Fa-la-la to you too, sir
Didn't you see the "curb your dogs sign?"
A farting dog is not a kite.
But can you read the sign?
I need to see his rabies certificate.
A flying chupacabra aye? I'm going to need to see a form of identification.
As stated in the fine print of the kite contest rules you and your kite must submit to drug testing. Please come with me.
No, the off-string section is closed. Too many fly aways.
Hot dogs, allowed; flying dogs, not.
Sorry sir, only pigs are allowed to fly here.
'I'm very good at catching'
You shoudn't support it. If he believes to be a kite, go to the therapist.
I'm sorry, we don't allow kites that chase other kites' tails.
It's not the $50 fine you should should worry about.  It's khaleesi.
Waddya mean Ben Franklin told you it was okay?
What? He's on a leash...
We're getting complaints from other patrons about being shat on.
Yeah, that's great. You still need to clean clean up after it.
Sir, this park is anti-fur.
Don't forget to use a poop bag
Did you bring your pooper scooper, sir?
Sir, all dogs must be on a lead of no longer than six feet.
Sir, do you know the location of the clown's helium tanks?
Helium is cheating, and no one will look up to a rat.
You and I, my friend, will have a serious talk after he comes down from his high!
Excuse me, sir, that is clearly an Airedale, not a kite.
Can't you read. The dog park is the next one over.
This is the Kite Park. The Zoo is next doors.
I had the same problem after Detroit abandoned wind wings.
The real trick to keeping it light is dogwood.
Is that a Jeff Koons kite?
I am going to have to ask you to desist and decease as you are creating a hostile play environment.
The signal worked! Your stray dog has been found.
How is your kite at tracking?
Thanks for keeping him on a leash.
No Airedales allowed, sir.
Realy, Again
Teddy wanted me to say hello "
The picnickers are complaining you're not curbing your pet.
Like the brewery.
I'm sorry - you'll have to leave. Just having a tail doesn't qualify it as a kite
I don't care if he's on a leash. You still have to pick up after him.
All right, have it your way - you heard a fox bark!
Meet my Dog:Kite
Listen up, Ace, this is neutral airspace. Dogfights are strictly prohibited.
You got a permit for that?
No dogs allowed ... on the ground or in the air.
Just make sure you keep him on his leash.
Oh, hello Officer. City dogs, am I right?
Just make sure you scoop up any unidentified falling objects.
Sorry, animals are not allowed in the park.
This is a NO DOGS park!
How did you do it?
I don’t care, Sir, if your dog’s sur name is Roosevelt.
Inflated dog ego, again?
I’m sorry sir, but the dog park was closed.
No dogs allowed Sir, even on a leash.
this is a no dog kite park
Wrong Place .. the dog park is a block to the South .
Now what are you up to Mr Michael Moore?
I never heard of a dog eating helium dog treats. Just be sure he doesn't poop on anyone's head and you clean up after him.
It’s the urinating on others that seems to be the problem.
How's he off the leash?
I think it's implied from "No Dog Walking".
That's right.  I am from animal and pest control.
Dogs, cats and donkeys are OK.  But no elephants.
The fact that he’s still
alive, I find very
disturbing
Does its poop float too?
Sorry, no dogs allowed on...or over the park!
Nope.  The Kite Pork is two blocks over
Hey bird dog you're on the wrong trail
Sir, I really don't think this is keeping with the spirit of our leash laws.
Sir, you are in clear violation of rule number one of the park.
Y'all be cuckin'?
I know you call him Teddy, but you must exercise him the regular way.
Sir, the dog park is on the other side of the lake.
I'm sorry sir but it's kites and small pets only.
I'm just playing with my dog, officer.
I don't care if he gets car sick.
But the sign only said 'No dogs on the grass'.
What are you doing after work, officer?
Sorry sir, but that is not a leash.
You're really trying to hotdog it sir!!
Next week is the animals , this week - mundane only .
Where’s your poop scooper?
This way of getting high is legal in all states, now.
Sir, I don't think that's what a flying fox is.
Did your kid abrogate your password?
I found him on I95.
I don’t care if it’s on a leash. The rule is no dogs allowed.
The dog park is west of here.
Sir no dogs are allowed.
Airedale or no airedale, he can't fly here!
This is a kites only area sir!
You'll still have to pick up it's poo
Sorry, only Falas allowed.
Picking up after your pet isn't quite sufficient in this case, sir.
Thank you for bringing a leash this time, but I have to insist that you don't come back until his bladder infection clears up.
You still have to clean the poop from the air.
So, are you telling me that you have a dog in this flight?
I am the wind beneath his wing.
Sir, do you have a license for that Airedale?
You can tell Roosevelt yourself.
But I see people fly dragons here all the time!
Sir, we’ve received complaints from our flying letter carriers.
Sir, I’m going to need you to cooperate and give me my kite back immediately.
I'll let it go this once, but next time,curb your kite.
You need a permit.
How do you get it to fly right with such a short tail?
I don't care that it's a Flying Airedale, no dogs allowed.
Sorry Buddy. 'Ground Only'  dog leads...
The veterinarian said the medical pet edibles wouldn’t get her high...
I hope he’s trained.
Well they didn't consider it to be 'lucky', sir.
It came with its own tail
Go back, for this way lies only death.
But what if he piddles on someone?
Sir, it's box kites only.  No Boxers!
I'm sorry sir, but string does not constitute a leash.
Franklin, not Teddy.
So, “Sully’s” training dogs now?
I would love to meet Air Bud if he has time for a fan
Something's been falling from your kite.
Didn't you read the sign? Dogs must be kept on a six foot leash.
'Sorry pal, all dogs must be on a leash.'
This better work, Jeff, the chief will have my badge with any more screwups!
Really, a "Service-dog" ?
While we all agree that this is a remarkable feat, the rules nonetheless state that no dogs are allowed in the park.
He's having trouble adjusting to the elevation.
I don't think you got the correct shape and measurements!
I assume his bark is worse than his kite.
I'm holding her for a friend...
You've got bags right?
Sorry pal, this is an off leash park.
Would you like to know why I'm wearing my spare hat?
Well you should store your medical marijuana someplace he can't reach.
Sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I have to cite you for improper use of Falcor.
We have a very strict anti-pouching law
Diaper please.
...and if PIGS could fly, I wouldn't be wearing this uniform, sir.  But that's not even a pig.
I don't care if he is an Airedale, no dogs in this park.
Yes, but it's not a leash.
The fact remains
you still have to scoop
I'm sorry, sir. As impressive as that is, dogs are still not allowed.
Your figurative design is a bold rejection of geometric kite hegemony. Seriously, dude, this shit belongs in the MOMA. Like I'm misting up realizing that I am but a humble midwife attending the birth of a true paradigm shift.
How many pigeons did he eat?
It's an emotional support kite.
We had a report of an Unidentified Flying Otterhound in the area.
But what it is dropping is not lighter than air.
I'm sorry sir, I don't care what your dogs name is.
the PETA kite-watch rep says its "shaming","  it'll have to come down.
May I see your doggy bag?
The three little pigs finally moved into that condo on the 4th floor.
Sir, you've got to stop feeding him cheese so you can bring him to the regular dog park.
sorry sir.  This is a vegan kite ground
I thought you said your dog does not kite."  "That is not my dog.
Sorry, dogs are only allowed off-ground before 9 A.M.
That is not the kind of leash we require.
Sir, go fly a wildebeest was last week.
Wow, that 3D printer sure nailed Trixie's image !
I’m a cat person too.
Don't tell me. He's an Airedale.
Walkies have gotten so much easier since he got his medical marijuana kibble.
We're going to have a problem if he decides to relieve himself up there.
I'm sorry, sir, only fabric tails are accepted in this competition.
We are concerned your biodegradable bags won’t do the job given today’s winds of change.
Too much levity.
The bird dog park is two blocks north.
ICE! Come with me.
No, it’s a “bahks” kite.
Big stick, not big schtick.
I’m sorry, sir, but your dog needs to be on a leash.
Sir, The park is only for kites.
Nice try, but you still need to be at the dog park  on the west side.
Sir, I hope you're not here looking for any dogfights."
Seth McDonough, Chico, C
Don’t you know the cruelty to kites rule?
Sorry buddy. No dogs allowed.
She’s a service dog.
It's a tissue issue.
I appreciate the fact that your dog is not "in the park" sir but you still have to pick up after it and if she hits the sign I'll write you up for vandalism.
My kid is at school.
Only quadrilaterals, sir.
There are no sky curbs.
You know, helium is not good for dogs.
Sir, this airspace does not allow predatory behavior.
Has your kite been vaccinated?
Sir, we don't allow poorly drawn kites in this park
It's nice you volunteer at the Humane Society, but...
No union kites.
I'm sorry Mr. Pruitt...I'll have to ask you to leave the park.
Left-handed, sir? Are you sure about that, sir?
No, having a tail does not make it a kite!
You'll have to leave sir.  The dog park is on the other side.
You'll have to unleash him, sir. Park policy is, 'All dogs go to heaven.'
Flying dog recreation?
Kites only please.
Idon't have a kite, so I'm flying my dog Fala instead
You would have to go to the nearby Kennedy Park, Flying Foxes are banned here.
We received notice of a nearby bank robbery by a dog. Have you seen anything unusual?
I checked.  There is no such thing as a Kiditarod.
I sure hope she doesn't have any unfinished "business".
You wouldn't know happened to all the birds in the park, would you?
My ex-wife was a helium balloon.
Sir, all animals must be kept on a leash.
Your dog needs to stop sniffing under the tails.
In respect to the park's leash laws
You‘ll need to get up there with a pooper scooper, I‘m afraid.
Yes officer, my dog is as high as a kite.
We still have scoop laws, you know.
You'll have to fly a scooper kite after it to clean up any floating messes it leaves.
Sorry,sir. That kite can only be flown at Trump Park.
Point taken, but you need to take it to the dog park.
Sir, please curb your dog.
You are too early for the Thanksgiving Day parade !
It's a bucket list thing. Rex here is trying to out-do Fala.
Sir, PETA would like to have a word with you...
Sorry, no Airedales.
The only animals allowed in this park, sir, are teddy bears.
I know you work in the subway but you're scaring the kids.
I don't care if he was barking. We're the only ones in charge of detention.
We double the fine for not cleaning up after your dog.
Hey buddy, the Dog Park is next door.
Sorry sir, the dog park's a block away.
I don’t care if it can fly. Rules are rules.
Does your airedale have a license to glide ?
Dog park is on the next block, sir.
Sorry sir, but as the kite sign says: No kite dogs are allowed in the kite park.
Maybe you should keep her on Maintenance.  I don't think she needs Lite.
Yeah...so she's not buying that it was good luck. I'd advise you to buy her a new hat and fly him over unoccupied space.
I understand but it has to be on a leash too.
There's still a warrant out for "The Outlaw of Falahill." 
You better bring him down and turn him in.
The word that comes to mind is "DOGGONE.
I don't care if his name is "Kite". No dogs in the park.
That may fly "down under" buddy, but not here in the U.S. of A.
Sir, that's a dog, not a kite, and that's not going to fly here.
No, just no.
Tie the kangaroo down, sport.
I suppose you think you’ve got the wolf on a string.
If you give them a long leash, they'll make fools of themselves.
The no dog rule includes kites.
It may not be an endangered species, but it looks worried.
Well, yes, the President did like dogs. But we'd all feel -- um, safer -- if you'd keep him on the ground.
A pre-op kite?
An Airedale? That shit don't fly with me.
I think you and your dog should Google Image search "catbird".
Your taxidermist is a very talented individual.
Sorry, sir.  The inflatable dog park is next door.
You were right, Sir. There IS an exception for Airedales!
Sir, all dogs are required to be on a leash.
What did you use for a tail?
And you're sure he likes it?
Meet my dead raccoon, Kite.
Sir, I don't care that you're "doing it for the Insta."
Ok, but you still should have stayed in the dog run.
I am sorry, sir, the rules expressly forbid dog-fighting.
I don't care if his name is Fala,  this park is not dog-friendly.
The Roadrunner is in the other part of the park.
I hear ya but you still need to use the dog walking park or get a citation.
The Westminster Kennel Club didn't have a problem with it.
Sir, I'm sorry, but you cannot fly your dog within 50 yards of the kites.
Yes, sir, I see that he's still on the leash, but I'd still like for you to take him back to the dog park.
Yes, I understand it's a wolf in kite's clothing. 
You still need a permit.
You have to move along to the border between the kite park and the dog park.
I don't care if his name is Fala, bring him down!
Your dad is here to see you, Mr Kite
Is he eco-friendly?
Sir, please clean up the mess on the roof of the utility shed.
I didn't bring a kite and he just took off- really had to go!
Sir, the dog show is next week.
But Officer, he's on a leash.
The ASPA has some questions.
You're under arrest for pumping your dog full of helium.
I said "on a leash," Sir.
Visa please?
Is that really a kite?
He drops it; you pick it up.
Look, I've heard of rat-tails on a kite, but this is ridiculous.
Just kiting a hound dog...is there a problem?
How do you plan on cleaning up after him?
I think it needs a longer tail.
oh damn, very tight
I don’t care “its only a drone” - it will still need a collar!
Be sure to keep him inside the dog fly.
Just make sure to clean up his poop.
Cleaning up after won't cut it.
Gas or no gas, it doesn't qualify as a leash.
Does your dog have a tag?
I know he's a Airedale, but ... laughing gas?
Sorry, sir, but the new Supreme Court majority ruled it’s unconstitutional to interfere with the Dog Rapture.
If your dog got high-as-a-kite in the park, I'll have to issue a citation.
You have a license to fly Dumbo, not Lucy.
As long as he’s on a leash...
It's what Fido would have wanted.
I cannot allow flying pigs
Sorry sir, we said no hats allowed in the park. Hey, nice kite.
Sorry sir. No dogs allowed in this park.
Sir, even if it were a sail cat--which it isn't--it still would not be allowed in this park.
Is he toilet trained?
Wrong country buddy
I'm looking for terrier with a short tail.
Sir,  we’ve been getting complaints about beagle waste again.
The kids say this is normal behavior for Molly.
Has Ben been by lately?
The Four Freedoms don't include dog flying.
Sorry, no airedales allowed.
I wasn't in the mood for barbeque.
Interesting. I always thought cats were the ones who preferred weed.
I assume that's a border collie?
My dog Paco is a bit flighty
Be glad it's not his dick.
But he's a therapy dog, officer.
Sorry sir, flying pets or children is not allowed in this section of the park.
You probably don't even know after which Roosevelt this park is named!
Yes, Officer, I've brought a poop bag.
Wagging your dog in the park?  Whaddaya tryin' to hide, bub?
I'm sorry, sir, there's an eight foot leash limit.
No, this isn't the open casting call for Cirque du Soleil Les Folies Canines.
Have you seen a man walking a dog? This is a kite park. No dogs are allowed, so if you see him, let me know, OK?
Maybe your dog likes helium, maybe he doesn't. I want to talk to him.
I don't know how you are doing that, but the fact remains that the lyric is 'crying all the time', not 'flying all the time'.
He’s got gas
Just be careful when your pooch expels all that methane.
I'm sorry but that doesn't count as a leash.
Why can't you fly balloon kites like all of the rest of these people?
Excuse me. You misunderstood.  “It’s when pigs fly.”
Be sure to pick up your poop.
The dog park is one block over.
Sir, do you know it's a capital offense now to denigrate a government official?
Does your dog bite?
Sir, please stop wildly swinging your dead dog through the air. This is a kite park.
Sir, please curb your kite.
Yes, Mr. Brown, I HEARD what you said when the tree ate all your other ones!
It's fine as long as it's a breed that has a tail.
Sir, we've had some complaints. Did you bring any umbrellas to share?
Kitty is spelled K-I-T-T-Y
Apparently you were right here when it hit the fan.
I'm afraid you need a leash with that kite.
Couldn't make it to the dog park?......you'll still have to clean up after him!
Where's your scooper or baseball glove?
'No Dogs Allowed' means ALL DOGS - you'll have to leave.
It would fly better with a longer tail.
I'm sorry, sir. Dogs must be on a maximum 6' kite string.
Kite Park, Mr Macy, This a kite park.
I will dog you until your kite enters a kennel.
My parents said dogs don't go towards heaven.
Not kool.
I'll allow this in my park when pig fly, sir.
Could you let my dad down?
His mother was half ballon doggy
Officer, he is just taking assimilation to a higher level!
Roosevelt loved dogs. He took 'Fala' everywhere.
Sir, I'm afraid you need a permit to fly your dog.
Your Airdale just pooped  on a police car!
He just resigned.  You don't have to walk his dog for him anymore.
Is that kite friendly ?
Sir, you need to have your kite on a leash.
Nice try but you’ve still got to take him over to the dog park.
Sir, your under arrest! No I'm under a golden retriever.
But, that's the only thing I had with a tail!
Not a problem. I brought airbags.
I said, "No Airedales!"
Why yes sir, I did bring poop bags.
You knew the rules
I think I have a contact high.
Holy Cow, that pig can fly!
How about the kitchen sink next time?"
Nice bridle and beam reach.
This is a Kite Park, sir.
The sign says, 'No Pushcarts, Perambulators or Pooping Kites'.
Oh, I thought it said "KIT" park
I hope you will pick up after it?
There's a -- doggone it!
His flatulence isn't going to keep him up  forever. So bring him down gently.
Sir, please go to the zoo.
Excuse me, where can I find one of these exquisite kites?
Sir..when flying your dog, the ordinance dictates you must provide umbrellas within an obvious spatial proximity as well as a county approved aerial pooper scooper.
Never mind  the letter from your "doctor", you got the training certificate for your service kite?
You may understand me.  I'm looking for a guy flying a goat.
...well that sign doesn't say "dite" or "kog", so you'll have to leave.
Helium ? Yes sir
Well it's not a kite now, is it sir?
PETA has lodged a complaint against your object.
Leash or not. No dogs.
Excuse me sir.  Are you sure you're in the right pa
rk?
Bad gas
Sir, your dog has to be on a leash.
Yeah, he’s on a leash but it’s still not OK!
Sir, we’ve  been getting noise complaints....
I'm sorry sir, but pet kites are only allowed on Mondays and Wednesdays.
How long ago did your dog die?
I called the police  because you're flying makes me mad.
Did you just come from the vet? Your dog is as high as a kite!
Is that Fala?
Oh boy, the animal rights folks are going to have a problem with this one.
Stay in the Dog Park and tell the Guiness people to stop bugging me about world records.
You'll have to leash your kite.
I told you: No Dogs allowed!
Why me, why me?
I haven't trained him to go off leash.
He was always jealous of kites, and rightfully so.
Yep, he’s a purebred drone dog!
Got into the fairy dust again I see.
There's nothing wrong with flying 'em here, as long as he's under your control at all times, and you pick up all of his poops.
I don't care if he thinks he's a Macy's Day parade float.
this is a kite park, not a dog park.
Sir, your party is at the wrong park.  You need to go to the Edison Park down the street.
I'm sure he is a good boy, Allen, but he is clearly shedding.
Sorry sir but you can only fly donkeys here
My dog has always loved to fly so I keep him on a short leash.
At what height can they breed?
I’m sorry officer, I thought it was only an issue when pigs fly.
I’m sorry sir, we don’t accept flying marsupials.
Sir we have a strict policy against bringing pets to this park.
Sir, the dog park is two blocks north of here.
You still have to scoop up after her.
Be sure to pick up the poop!
Sir, Your dog must be leashed at all times.
No, this isn't the Roosevelt Kite Bait Park. That's in New Jersey.
I've been asked to remind you sir, you still need to curb your dog.
You've got to be more careful about the amount of beans you feed your puppy.
She better be house trained !
The cop said softly, “No dogs allowed.” The man replied, “What? Are you going to hit me with your big stick?”
Just as long as you keep him on a leash.
Sir, you can only fly your kite with the dorsal side showing.
Sir, you do realize that you are aiding and abetting a highly sophisticated dog pound escape attempt, don't you?
Sorry, no hounds. Toys only.
They told me I could use the park, no strings attached?
I told City Hall Starbucks shouldn't sponsor the dog park water fountain, but do they listen? Noooo."
We have leash laws here that prohibit you flying your pooch.
You still have to scoop the poop.
Ok Dr. Pavlov, you're training has gone far enough.
Excuses me Sir, when flying a dog you must display evidence of a dog excrement kit system at all times.
I understand the humor in hearing that high-pitched bark.  But pumping helium into your dog IS animal abuse!
This is your last warning, sir! The baloon guy is pressing charges next time
I don't care if he's high as a kite, but no dogs allowed.
We've been getting complaints that his bark is worse than his kite.
All dogs go to heaven, wanted to make sure he can see those pearly gates.
Is that your Airedale?
The dog-flying area is on the other side of the hill.
Do you call this a therapy dog?
Excuse me Sir, we don't provide poop bags in this park. Did you bring your own or some umbrellas?
Sir, have you seen the "clean up after your kite" signs.
We had a complaint about some uhh...  droppings
You'd better catch him when all the gas leaks out.
I couldn't find an off-leash park.
He'd rather fly than go for a walk.
Fine -- then you come straight to the security booth when it's time to feed your kite, sir.
It’s better than him chasing after cyclists.
But officer, the sign said "No dog walking allowed" -- he's not walking, he's flying!
This is a kite park...not a dog park!
Sir, you can't fly that in this park.
Mr. Booth, I presume?
What's your problem? He's on a leash
Your kite discriminates against flying cows.
I don't care if it helps his balance- dog kites must be neutered.
I'm sorry, but the leash law maximum is six feet.
He's Over it not On it
Excuse me sir, do you have a catch it and bag it license?
This IS a kite.  Don’t you see the tail?
We didn’t have the gonads to choose, “Latest in men’s fashion from the folks at #MeToo.” What makes you think we’re interested in your thoughts about flying pigs?
Sir, this is my last warning to you that poop bags are required for pets in this park.
How do you handle the poop?
Excuse me, sir. Forgive me for appearing dogmatic or discriminatory but the Dog Flying Park is next door.
We ran out of seaweed.
The sign clearly says no dogs!
Is your dog named roosevelt?
I don't care what his name is, dogs are not allowed in the park!
But Officer, He's an airedale!
We use a leash
I'm afraid you'll need a license in order to fly a Fake Kite.
Dog is spelled D-O-G
I don't care if your dog's name is Roosevelt or not!
That's how high a dog with a dream can fly.
Well, Ill be dog gone!!
You'll get better stability with a longer tail!
No dogs in the park.
Be sure you pick up after him
It's OK officer, it's an Airedale!
Can you prove he's an airedale?
Hey Buddy! The dog park is two blocks  north of here!
Did you walk him before sending him up?
Tailwind is a real bitch today, Officer.
It just looks like it's moving.
No dogs allowed above the park, sir.
The sign clearly stated: NO DOGS ALLOWED.
Officer, It's a Dog Day Afternoon.
So you have no idea who overturned all the trash cans in the park?
I'm sorry sir you'll have to leave.   
You just don't fit in.
That leash is way over ten feet.
Sir, Your cat was hit by a car.
Yes, but have you seen my pig fly?
No, the Akita Park is over the next hill.
Sir, have you seen any large seagulls.. there have been some complaints
The next time you inflate that thing, be sure there are no children around.
Yes, my dog is THAT gassy.
Airedales are terriers, and that dog is no terrier.
Look, Sir. We don't allow stunt flying in this park!
Fala in the sky with diamonds...
Unless there's helium in his poop, you'll still need a bag. But the squeaky bark is very amusing.
Nobody told me it couldn’t be a live animal.
No, the "no dogs" sign did not just mean at ground level!
Have you not  considered an off leash park ?
He got his balls removed and up he went.
Have you seen my dog?
Flying a terrier is NOT one of the "Four Freedoms."
Dog ok. Pig, not so much.
I don’t care if he’s lighter than air. I still need to see his dog license.
I don't care if it's a kangaroo.
I'm sorry,sir,you dog does not have a collar and tags.
There’s a rule. No helium.
My taxidermist is experimenting with balloon animals
I am a very moral person. I follow the rules that I wrote myself.
Sir, the taxidermy contest is next week.
Say my neighbor's dog is a beagle.
It makes the leash law bearable.
$3 fee and the hours are 2am to 4am. And NO, I do not work for I.C.E."
Nice try sir. But it’s still no dogs allowed in the park
Inflatables not allowed!
Hey falla, delano better?
I'll need to get his DNA in case you are separated.
I'm sorry, sir. A tail is not the only entry criterion.
Filling your helpless pet with helium is simply hilarious. The fact that he is obviously terrified makes it even funnier. (Please vote for my caption so I can appear on the morning news).
Excuse me, Sir, do you have a license for your kite?
Sir, you’ll need to keep your dog on a shorter leash.
Flying chihuahas were banned last year.
But Rover gets car sick!
How familiar are you with the Endangered Species Act?
Okay buddy-Animal Control called-its your dog-he wants down.
dogs must be on a leash
No leashes in the kite park!
I think you're pet is taking "When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on" a little to serious.
Sir, Airedales are not allowed in this park.
No flying endangered kites.
How’s Fido been doing since he retired from the NYPD sniffer dog unit?
But officer, his name is 'Teddy.'
japan is 6,321 miles. try it there.
Sorry, sir, but we consider filling your dog with helium abusive.
He likes it!
No leashes allowed. Strings only."
Sorry sir, you can fly dragon kites, but not dogs
It's walk your dog...fly a kite, not walk your kite and fly your dog.
We require everyone to clean up after their kite.
You are aware of the $300 fine for falling organic waste, right?
So you are flying that in honor of FALA, President
Roosevelt''s dog???
I hope he's already been walked.
And how do you plan to pick up after him, sir?
It's quite simple, officer, he's an Airdale.
Sir, you're in the wrong park. The warning sign says 'BEWARE OF FOG'…
Let her go. She
Look at this high dog dick!
Usually we only allowing flying pigs!
Only one pig allowed in the park at any time.
Sir, please use our 'flying pets' park instead!
Do you have the extender for your popper scooper?
I appreciate the fact that he's an Airedale, but you still can't walk him here.
Your dog’s had enough time up there, sir.
We’re getting complaints that your kite needs a diaper.
Didn't I tell you last week....no dogs allowed?
You’re disqualified. The tail isn’t long enough.
The Dog Park is a few blocks south of here.
This isn't the dog park. Please don't fly your dog here.
Flying kites is allowed but flying canines is forbidden.
I trust you've brought a plastic bag with you!
Sure, a dog kite is fine,
but not with an actual dog.
This park was designated for kites only by Presidential Decree.  You'll have to practice for the Thanksgiving Parade somewhere else.
Sorry, but the bone is stuck in a tree
Sir, has your dog been into the grass again?
Sorry, sir, the dog park is off West 44th.
He’s been this way ever since he got into my charred White Oak barrel aged bourbon.
Sorry- the Airedale Club meets next week!
Yes he’s a border collie, but he flew here legally.
You work for Superman?
I don't care if he is an airedale sir, reel him in...NOW!
Other fliers are complaining that your helium-filled canine is marking their kites.
Unique exercise for your canine, Sir, but this is not the Dog Park.
I don't care if he is on a light diet ...
The dog park is down the road .
Excuse me, sir. The Roadkill Kite Park is right across the road.
I don't care if it has a tail, we don't allow balloons to fly
Sorry sir but you can't fly your dog here. This is a kite park.
If that thing up there poops on somebody’s head, you are out of here.
Is that leash FAA approved?
Just to be clear, if your dog poops in the Park, charges will be double.
Officer, my dog thought he was a cat and started playing with string.  Next thing I know...  Hmm, I guess that excuse won't fly, will it?
That’s impressive, but Fido being as high as a kite doesn’t count. There’s an actual dog park down the road.
Yup ... he’s Pavlov’s great great great great grand-dog.
The dog kite park is two blocks over.
So think, man:  What happens when your Fido needs to relieve himself at 100 feet up?  That's why this ain't no dog park.
Yes, it's cruel. He'll have to fart sometime.
If he poops, he poops.
We're getting complaints about projectile droppings.
Does he mark his territory?
No dogs allowed, period!
'I'm the surly bonds, yup.'
Sorry, only kites permitted.
I'm sorry.  No dog balloons allowed.
Sir, you need to void your dog.
He must suffer when he goes to a skate park.
Last call, Sir.  The helium bar is closing in fifteen minutes.
You aren't allowed FlyingDog or any alcohol in the park.
The dog park is next door.
Keep it down sir.
Sir. Clean up after your kite.
Is that the Trump kite?
Sir, dogs may fly only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
You think that's a good kite?
Franklin...Teddy...it don't matter. Get him down.
The Bull Moose is only animal that may be flown here.
You are intimidating the other kites.
You've got to understand, Igor,'Go fly a kite' is just an expression."
I’ve been told your kite has been biting some of the other kites
Sorry --no dogs off the leash
Your shoe lace is untied.
Don't worry, he's potty-trained.
Sorry sir, the Macy's Parade balloon auditions were cancelled.
Just be sure to clean up after him.
You do realize this is is only for the Birds.
Regulations say all aerial canines must be diapered at all times.
Do you need directions to the Dog Park?
Sir, I must remind you to clean up after your kite.
Don’t worry sir, he’s wearing a diaper this time.
Are you aware of our diaper laws?
That better be an Airedale.
He's a Rainbow Retriever
The dog park is down the street
Listen, I've told you before:
Unless he's got a doggie diaper, he's grounded!
Sir, you know the off leash dog park is just over there?
So,why did you name him Roosevelt?
His name is "Kite," and he loves to fly!
I'm sorry sir, but the law requires dogs to be walked on the ground.
No dogs allowed off-leash and that string doesn't qualify as a leash!
We get a lot of Airedales here.
You are still going to need to poop scoop.
I’m gonna need to see your “flying dog” permit.
I don't care if your dog is full of gas, you still cannot fly him like a kite
He's an Airedale and he prefers this over the doggie park.
I realize he's on leash, sir, but you still have to ''poop and scoop''.
Yes,the 6 ft leash law holds for birddogs too.
Sir, that's not a leash;  you'll have to come with me.
He guzzled my holiday punch.  He's high as a kite.
Think you are looking for the Lincoln Dog Park.
Sorry, buddy, you'll have to fly your Airedale in the dog park.
So I took him literally and seriously.
Bird dog or no, he can't be here.
It's a new trend Officer.
Can I borrow one of your keys for something?
I think you know why we need a urine test on him...
Hey pal, this park's got a strict policy about dogs on grass.
Relax, he's not marking his territory.
Is he sky trained?
Dogs must be on a leash not a string.
Not even on a leash ...
It's not the dog that's the issue, sir. It's the droppings.
At least its not raining men.
Sir, in this Park, Pets have to wear Mouth Guards!
Curb your dog or I'll have to write you up.
Ever had Updog?" "What's Updog" "Not much, what's up with you?
Do you have a license for that kite?
Okay, but keep him on the leash.
I'm sorry but the park rules are no pets allowed.
But she IS on a leash....a very long leash!
Excuse me sir, I have to ask you to come back tomorrow when Ferret kites will be allowed.
Sir, taxidermy is an indoor display only and not permitted in this park.
I have to write you up for flying without a dog permit.
The fact that it's an "Airdale" makes no difference, sir....
Doggone Mister. Please scoop responsibly.
I swear, officer,... I did bring doggie bags.
No sir, this does NOT excuse you from cleaning up after your dog when you walk him.
He wouldn't be able to do this normally, but I've put him on a diet more recently.
I told him, as long as he holds his breath he'll stay up there
I've had multiple complaints -- you need to curb your dog
Sir, that doesn't count as a leash.
We don't allow  the use of long leashes in the park.
The park rules make no exceptions,sir. No dogs means no dogs!
Sorry sir, you'll have to leave. Checkers is not allowed. Only dogs named Fala are allowed on the grounds.

Sir, that's not how we walk our dogs here.
But yours isn't neutered
Sir, helium is a canine laxative?
I don't know how you filled him with helium, but it's against the rules.
This is taking the leash law too far.
I just hope that leash is retractable.

Sir, you should bring this entry back in 2020
sorry officer, he's emotionally attached to this park.
I know how the park is called. It's the howling that is against the rules.
He's one of the Wright brothers grandsons, just let him feel connected to his heritage.
Is your stepmother an alien, too?
Yes, I understand he's technically on a leash, but it's still not allowed.
Sure, the rules say nothing about foxes, but you can’t use helium to fly a kite.
I'm afraid this is unsanctioned emotional support.

Are you aware that there is no pooping in this park?

He's from the Flying Beagles.
You think because you have a leash on him you're his master? He could destroy you with a flick of his wrist. Start begging fool.
That's not technically a leash.
Kite or no kite, he’s gotta have a license...
Sir, does your dog aim well downward?
Officer, you have to wait your turn!
Buddy, there's more to it than just having a tail.
Sorry...He keeps getting into the helium.
Yeah, but there's a leash law.
Helium is a banned substance in kite flying.  You're disqualified.

She was cited for barking up the wrong tree earlier, sir, don't let it happen again.
Sir, you are going to have to leave, no strings attached.
No, we don't make exceptions for Airedales.

No, helium dogs are not illegal, but your string is not up to code.

You know we could've had eggs for life, right?
Like I said yesterday, it's almost done.
It’s not a grill problem; it’s a chicken problem.
I don't tell you how to gather.
Cook time is 15 minutes per pound - Go ahead and plant the potatoes!
A simple 'Thank you for inventing fire' would be nice.
Of course it's rare - it's almost extinct.
It took one million years to discover fire. You can wait another five minutes.
I’d invite the neighbors for dinner, but our dinner ate the neighbors.
Of course it's paleo.
It's the last time I let your father shop at Costco.
I'm more curious about where you found the spatula and grill.
Well... it's pterodactyl. Tastes like chicken.
Quit your complaining, when I was a kid we didnt even have fire.
Eat it raw?  What are we, neanderthals?
We can put the leftovers in the glacier
You should see the breasts
Rare? It is nearly extinct.
Wait till you see the egg we’re having in the morning.
You're damn right it's free range!
No.  There is not enough for your mother to come over.
I’m calling it the George Beforeman Grill.
If you hear a heavy hopping sound, get back into the cave.
Mark my words, son. The Weber clan will be revered for generations.
No, Timmy, dinner is not ready yet; why don't you go draw on the wall or something?
Do I tell you how to gather?
Everyone OK with dark meat?
Never shop hungry.
This is way better than that stupid wheel you got me last year.
I said it was for dinner. I didn't say it was for tonight's dinner.
A Pinot Noir, I think, from the back of the cave.
Trader Joe's was closed, so I went to Costco.
1,000,000 Years B.K.F.C
I'm beginning to think this whole fire thing is a game-changer.
Could someone invent me a beer
This isn't what I thought you meant when you said you'd spend all summer grilling.
It's one of those "cook once, eat all week" recipes.
Before fire, we used to eat earlier.
Of course it's not done, I only discovered fire an hour ago.
Wait til you see the breast.
Relax Son. Tonight we all get the drumstick.
I'm sorry honey but they were all out of wings!
Why don’t you do some drawings on the walls? This’s going to take awhile!
It was fast food before I caught it.
Don't just stand there. Go gather a salad.
I had a coupon.
Dinner will be ready any day now.
I discovered fire, constructed a grill, and killed a pterodactyl - and you want fries?
Honey, what’s 15 minutes per pound times 2,000?
Actually, it’s tofurodactyl but it tastes just like chicken.
Just because it ate Bob first doesn’t make us cannibals.
You said to get the biggest one they had.”
Will you stop crying?  Nobody needs a pet that big!
I hope it's good, it's the last one.
So then Phil says, ‘Of course Paleo is healthy - how do you think I’ve made it to 27?’
They call it the George Beforeman grill.
Dinner will be ready in three days.
I don't think I invented enough fire.
Put the corn on in 3 weeks.
If you want it rare, we can eat tomorrow, otherwise we're looking at sometime next week.
It’s a T. Rex, but it tastes just like chicken.
You scoff now. But millions of men will emulate me.
Laugh now, but trust me, supersizing is the future.
Because I'm waiting for that little red thing to pop out.
You said two days on each side, right?
We’ll be extinct by the time this is done cooking
How much longer? I have no idea. We haven’t invented time yet.
Someone go gather a salad.
Well if you'd taken the chicken out of the glacier before I got home like I asked we wouldn't have this problem.
Big Bird?   I haven't seen him.
I'm telling you this for the last time.  Your pet Dino ran away.  Now who wants dark meat?
Why don't one of you go inside and invent me an ice cold beer.
Even better, we now have a lifetime supply of feathers to sleep on.
Hunters: 1, Gatherers: 0. Just sayin'.
There's starving Neanderthal kids who would love to have brontosaurus every night.
Honey, now the kids say they prefer the wing.
COSTCO. I had to buy 6 of 'em.
Come and get it, before its mate comes and gets us.
Maybe you SHOULD have married a gatherer.
Change of plans. Nuts and berries for dinner, big breakfast tomorrow.
No, I rather not invite them ... all this yabadabadoo really gets on my nerves
Dinner won't be ready until the late Pleistocene.
Hand me the big platter.
The butcher was having an extinction sale.
And tomorrow we'll have Pteridactyl Tetrazzini, Friday Pteridactyl Sandwiches with cranberry sauce, Saturday we'll make soup from the carcass....
We have A1 sauce, since that’s the only letter and number we’ve invented.
If you need a birthday gifts idea, I could use a bigger grill.
Yes! I shoulda started the coals sooner!! Thank you!!!
I told you we didn’t need the 8 piece bucket
What? Pterodactyl again?
Now you tell me you're vegan?
You should have let me buy the bigger grill.
Whaddya say we post a drawing of tonight's dinner on Cavewall?
When I invent the wheel, we can do it rotisserie-style.
Careful.  He's still getting around okay with one leg.
Now is not a good time to tell me you're vegan.
Well if you’d have let me have the Grill-Monster Delux I wanted, we’d all be eating by now!
The grill looked bigger on cavebook!
No, let's grill the whole thing," you said
I’m on my last leg.
No, it is not a dinosaur leg! For the thousandth time, we did not live during the same time period they did.
The kids say they want hot dogs!
Are you OK if it’s a little rare?
Keep an eye out for her mother
Well honey, he's overcompensating—I'll explain it when you're older.
Go marry a gatherer then, why don't ya Linda?
Almost done! Go get the other one.
Why are you looking at me like that? My doctor said I could have one piece of meat a day.
By the time that’s ready, we’ll be extinct.
He's big, has three legs, and is really, really angry.
You standing there won’t make it cook any faster!
I told you not to name it.
Remind me to turn it over next Tuesday.
Two kids, one drumstick? What were you thinking?
Maybe we should go ahead with the salad.
Trust me...there'll be plenty of rare.
Should I tell the Smiths we're pushing dinner back a moon cycle?
I invented fire—I think I know when it's done.
You want fast? Or you want good?
I just invented leftovers.
What? It's not like they're going extinct.
Rare? Yes...damn near extinct.
I told you we needed a bigger grill.
Maybe go ahead and start on the potato salad.
You're going to want to petroglyph this.
For the last time, it is NOT Big Bird.
These Weber grills work so much better since we discovered fire.
Yes. It was grass-fed.
Original or  Crispy ?
Yes, I cleaned the grill first.
I don't know where Mr. Fluffles went. Maybe he went to live with the other mammoths upstate.
They were out of Dodo
Yes, I already applied the rub. What do you think I am, a Neanderthal?
They say it tastes just like chicken.  Whatever that is.
We're gonna need the big buns.
I’m sick of Paleo, we’re doing Precambrian tonight.
I can't wait for the knife to be invented.
Just wait until you see the eggs at breakfast
No, there's not enough to invite your mother over.
Let's eat before its mother comes back.
It was on sale.
There's never an active volcano around when you need one.
It's T-Rex/Mex
You want it Cretaceous Style or Honey Jurassic?
This is a hard meal to balance.
If you wanted to eat at 6 every night, you should have married your fancy pants "gatherer" boyfriend!
I need you to do some foraging—for exactly 11 herbs and spices.
Yes, I am sure it is grass-fed!
Not so bad.  The hard part was getting the charcoal.
Let’s all agree to never talk about what we saw today
Might need a little help flipping this.
I forget. Do I turn it once a week or once a month?
What do you mean, they are not coming? I just cooked for twelve!
Your dad is just excited about discovering fire. Be patient with him.
Look I was fine with raw, YOU wanted barbecue!
Now would be a good time to start gathering side dishes.
So, do a wall painting in the meantime.
Sweetie, could you bring me the basting broom?
Well, whatever it was, it's extinct now
Raw or medium raw?
Does anyone else hear something hopping this way?
We're still not inviting your mother over.
Dinner will be ready in two weeks.
How much longer? The kids are evolving into vegans.
Paleo again ?
Let's eat dessert first
Well, you know, I had to invent fire first.
The doc says on this paleo diet, we could easily live to be thirty, maybe thirty-two years old!
They’ll have to call him Big Foot instead of Big Feet now!
Don’t look now, but there’s a very angry one-legged pterodactyl headed this way.
I’m calling it barbecue. Trust me. It’s going to be a thing someday.
Of course it's Organic!
And you said it wouldn’t fit...
One more day and it'll  fall off the bone.
It’s called the Paleo diet
Humor your father.  He's evolving . . .
I thought we could try eating Paleo for a change
Yes, dear, it's free range...that's what concerns me.
I told you I was going clubbing tonight.
Someone may need to run out for another bag of charcoal.
Medium-rare tomorrow, well-done next week.
Your mother just called . . . she’s bringing pizza!
Your choices are very rare and frightfully rare.
He was grass-fed.
Should be done by Thanksgiving!
Getting close now. Couple more sunsets, I’d say.
What do you mean you wanted pizza?
Of course it's rare: I just killed the last one!
Well-done, rare, or extinct?
Well done may not be an option.
Marinating it was the hard part.
Are we going paleo again?
No, gas would not be better.
You’re right, it is mammoth
Almost ready - just have the kids paint on the walls for a few minutes.
It should be done by the time we invent beer.
According to Johnson it tastes just like chicken.  Of course, that was before it ate Johnson.
Just a couple more days.  It’s still raw in the middle.
Of course it's free-range!
Why so much food for your art show? Who will ever have heard of some cave in Lascaux 20,000 years from now?
Is it time to gather the salad?
Don't start the potatoes yet.
Honey, can you bring me the tongs.
I know it feels like ages.
Keep an eye out for a large one-legged chicken.
Taking too long?! How about
"thanks for discovering fire so we don't have to eat raw flesh, Dad"?
Jane, have we invented sauce yet?
It should be ready in about a week.
I don't care if the Flintstones have a gas grill.
Fine, I admit it, the spatula was the wrong call.
Who’s for dark meat?
If you had let me buy that 6 burner propane grill, it WOULD have been ready by now!
Don't worry.  It is free range.
Daddy always has been a leg man !
I know I've beeen saying "ten more minutes" all night long, but who knows how long ten minutes IS, these days?
And so it began.  Man’s quest for an ever larger grill.
What did you do with the rest of it?
Fire good, concept of time bad.
No, I mean that's really the last of the dinosaur.
I warned you guys, giving it a name and making it, "part of the family", would make this kinda weird.
standing there watching ain’t goin’ to make it cook any faster.
Well, the store didn't have any jumbo shrimp.
I'm taking away your Costco card...
It will be ready when it’s ready, Helen.
If you think the leg is big, just wait till you see the breasts.
I should have taken it out of the freezer a little earlier.
What can I say? I’m more of a hunter-griller.
No more hunting and gathering at Costco.
This was the only grill I could find after Labor Day
Brilliant. How are you planning on getting to work, now?
If you're waiting for well done, you may as well get some sleep.
Oh NOW you all want breast instead.
This might take a while.
I know it's a lot but some day they will name a whole diet after me.
They won't remember me, but they'll never forget my invention.
But bone in is best.
Don't worry, I'm still vegan. It's an Impossible Mammoth.
Don’t worry, Dear, we can freeze the leftovers. After all, the forecast says the Ice Age is coming.
It tastes like chicken. I swear.
We all get the drumstick.
It’s much healthier than mammoth.
Don’t worry. It was raised cage free.
See kids, this is why I never let dad cook.
I  hope all of you like it rare.
It's fine, dinosaurs going extinct is a hoax.
Why yes, he did have yellow feathers and a long neck.
This is why I wanted the deluxe model.
Next time I do the hunting and you do the cooking
I have no idea why I call it a drumstick.
Honey, set the slab
Where did I get the grill?
Hope you all like dark meat!
Dinner will be ready in a week.
You said you wanted something besides burgers.
Here it comes again, a fight over the drumstick.
Rare is fine, we can't wait another three days.
If you want any sides, you’d better go gather them yourself.
Look.  I think we can all have dibs on the drumstick.  OK?
Low and slow, son. That's the key.
Don’t worry. It’s paleo
Still impressed by Kevin's wheel?"
Can you bring me the big spatula?
I want the gatherers to all smell this!
I'm sure it was free range.
Ready in five meant five days.
You should've seen the breast!
Yeah, I went to Costco.
Yes we can all have the leg
We'd be eating right now if you'd let me buy that GrillMaster 3000.
So what are you guys going to have for dinner?
The tricky part is flipping it.
Can you grab the large platter?
Now that I’ve discovered fire, you’re going to have to learn to wait.
We're gonna need a bigger barbecue.
I’ll need the large platter.
You'd better enjoy this, these guys won't be around much longer.
You have to let the flavor evolve.
Be patient! After all, I discovered fire only last week!!
Believe me, Alice, this paleo diet will be really trendy some day.
You could in the meantime do some gathering.
But we had pterodactyl last night.
Anyone else want one?
The key is to flip it once after 14 hours.
I know they are going extinct, but we have to eat, too
No, they didn’t have “free range” but the package on this one said “cage-free.”
Stop whining! Dinner will be ready in three weeks.
I told you to get the chicken with no added hormones
And how much did you gather today?
Do we have any Grey Poupon?
Alexa, order Dominos
The condiments aren't going to gather themselves.
I call this the Paleo diet.
Yeah I know, but I was the one who always had to walk him and pick up his poop.
They aren’t as fast as they look.
Trust me .... in a few million years everyone's going to be cooking this way.
You should've called dibs if you wanted the drumstick.
You laugh now. Paleo's gonna be all the rage in four million years.
they say if we don't limit meat to once a week, dinosaurs might go extinct."
Oh relax, Carol. The world isn't running out of mammoth anytime soon.
Sorry dinner is late. Took me longer to invent fire than I thought.
What?!!  They’re vegans?!!
A purist will tell you that charcoal does not impart the same flavor as a naturally occurring forest conflagration, but it's so much more convenient!
Just because it was on sale, doesn’t mean you had to buy it.
I'm told that it tastes like chicken.
Yes, it's Paleo-compliant.
Dinner will be ready in about 36 hours.
My fervent hope for our fledgling species is that one day we learn to take plants, press them into meat-like shapes, flavor them like meat, and then market the hell out them. Only then will this all have been worth it. Anyway, dinner's in five.
Who wants the last stegosaurus leg... ever?
Alright guys. Get ready for Dad's world-famous mammoth leg.
You are witnessing the dawn of Barbecue Man.
I hope that "well done"  means you're wildly impressed.
This new barbecue uses a state-of-the-art technology called 'fire'. It's supposed to make the food way better.
Original or extra crispy?
Don't worry. It says best before 2,000,000 B.C.
Let’s go light on the hors d’oeuvres.
The kids are starving, Link. I drummed for a pizza
Sure it's late ⁠— but you can't imagine how long it took me to make the fire.
Dinner will be ready next Thursday.
I said I was a hunter gatherer, not a short order cook. It'll be done when it's done.
Honey, the Dhitkuuds are asking if that's grass-fed.
We discussed this when we got the brontosaurus.
Look, this is going to take some practice. I only discovered fire last Tuesday.
Men. Always thinking it’s bigger than it really is.
Gimme a break, time hasn’t been invented yet...
Dinner isn't going to be ready for another era.
Well, I guess we will be eating chicken salad the rest of the week!
Honey, the Hudstones are vegans.
So, what are you guys having for dinner?
We might need to discover some more fire.
Real cavemen did not live in a brownstone in Brooklyn, Janet. If you want to go Paleo, we're going all in.
And this is exactly why I wanted a bigger grill on Fathers Day.
I'm sure glad we invented fire.  Before then, this barbecue grill was worthless.
They were all out of the boneless and skinless.
Did we use all the barbecue sauce for the last cave painting?
Come and get it, before it goes extinct.
Do we have a bigger spatula?
I can guarantee it was free range raised and inhumanely killed.
We waited two million years to harness fire. You can wait another hour for the perfectly grilled leg.
The formula is 7-6-5. Seven days on one side. Six days on the other. Blow out the fire and let it sit for five days.
Quit standing around, this thing's not gonna turn itself.
Dad, have you seen Wooly?
See? I do use my Father's Day gift.
Too big to fail.
Patience! So far all we've discovered is smoke.
I bet he's going to come back hoppin' mad.
This could take a while.
Is very rare OK?
It might be a while
Dino, where's Dino, mommy?
We're eating a vegetarian; ipso facto: it's a vegetarian meal.
Can you get it done before the next ice age?
It should be ready by the dawn of the Pleistocene.
If you would have just brought home the pterodactyl  wings like I asked we could be eating by now!
Okay, I’m ready for the Pterodactyl Helper.
I propose we switch. I’ll hunt and you cook?
You want raw or medium-raw?
Sadly this'll be the last time we'll eat dinosaur
This is why mother told me to marry a "gatherer."
I told you it's a lifestyle, not a diet.
Set the timer for 2 days
Just a couple more days and we should be good.
Quiet, I’m inventing mansplaining.
Which would you prefer -- Regular or Extra Crispy?
Another day, day and a half, should do it.
Hey, you're the one who said: 'Let's go paleo.'
It's not plant-based, but it is free-range.
I hope you don't want it well done.
You should've seen the one that flew away.
Keep an eye out for an annoyed three-legged mammoth."
Yes, it's velociraptor, but it tastes just like chicken.
The guy invented fire. You'd think he'd sell me a bigger grill.
White meat? Seriously?
Whaddya mean, "they won't eat dark meat?"
It was on sale, that’s why.
You need to invent a bigger fire.
Daddy had to bring Rex to a farm upstate. He has tons of room to run around now and tons of fresh air.
It was half-off.
See I told you... it would fit on the grill, Wilma.
So what if it's endangered? So are we.
I think we’re gonna to need a bigger spatula.
Who wanted the drumstick?
I need a plate.
No, I didn’t brine it.
Well... of course it was free range...
I was tired of nuts and berries.
God help you if you say you want white meat.
We won't have to fight over who gets the drumstick.
There’s only one drumstick - you’ll have to share.
We wouldn't be able to do this in the suburbs.
Just one more day.
You can’t rush flavor.
Sorry son they were out of pterodactyl wings
With the Dino-Grill I wanted, we'd be done eating by now."
A few more days should do it!
They’ll be extinct by the time you’re done.
Looks like dad has a leg up on the grilling competition!
I know — but the eggs were a nightmare to poach.
Tastes like mammoth.
It should be done any day now.
I got it at the Renaissance festival.
I'll need the wheelbarrow, and you'll need to invent a wheel for it.
Now you tell me no one wants dark meat??
Maybe we should wait for lightning.
The package says it is plenty for a family of 4.
I just invented the 'leftover'........
I got it at Costco
Yes, it IS free range pterodactyl, but I’m not sure about growth hormones.
If you want a bite, you have to say it. 'Hunters rule, gatherers drool.'
The hardest part was finding a match.
Will this be enough, or shall I put another one on?
Yes, he was grass fed, free range, and humanely treated.
I would have invented the tong before the spatula but whatever.
I call it charcoal, and we have enough left on the planet to last us millions of years.
The Indians canceled. I hope you're hungry.
Remember when I wanted to buy the bigger grill?
Yes, this does fit in the paleo diet.
That Fred Flinstone video made this look so easy!
How about doing something useful while you wait, like maybe invent beer?"
Have a snack... it's gonna be a while.
I saved the drumstick for you.
Don't blame me, I voted 'Remain.'
Are you sure you want this well-done?
Watch how daddy  flips it.
So I guess the whole vegan thing is out the window?
You wanted it rare? Heck, it's almost extinct.
The other end will be moist.
Everybody likes dark meat right?
Yes, I asked for nuggets, but then I said "Super size me".
What? You want white meat?
Who's hungry for Tricerachops?
I thought you said you liked dark meat.
Billy, you liked brontosaurus when you had it at Aunt Hilda’s.
Yes, everyone can have a drumstick.
Is everyone OK with medium-rare?
No more trouble than your egg salad.
Fred, Where's Dino?
Oh, oh. Here comes its mommy.
Did you gather a salad?
you want done fast, or you want done right?
I was thinking of tartare again, but I thought I would try this new fire thing.
Don’t worry...it tastes like chicken.
Overkill?
Honey, it is NOT a symbol of toxic masculinity, it is simply an oversized piece of meat.
We'd already be eating if you'd let me get the new Grill-O-Saurus!
We could use a salad, too. Why don't you guys go invent agriculture?
Yes it was hard getting it on the grill, but not as hard as getting it off the chickasaurus.
It’s a good thing it was road kill.
It was all that was left when I got to the kill.
Everybody ready for some Teriyaki Teradactyl?
You could help set the table if you're looking for something to do.
It was connected to the knee bone.  That's what it's all about.
Invite everyone.
Be on the lookout for a mad one-legged bird
I don't care if you're tired of chicken, we can't afford steak!
Get a little one next time you say? Like I’m getting into their nest?
Alright, alright - we'll use the microwave.
For the last time-- there IS no white meat!
It will be ready by the Neolithic Era, promise.
I went to Costco
Starting tomorrow we're vegans.
I decided to go to Costco.
Tonight we're gonna party like it's 9!
They don't call 'em mammoths for nothing!
Do you want it done,or done right?
I call it barbecue. It’s a guy thing.
You should have seen the breasts!
Do you want fries with it?
Excuse me, but just because I like to grill doesn't make me a caveman.
I swear. It said, ‘No Hormones’
I already told you —a good  leg of Brontosaurus just can’t be rushed!
I hope you gathered barbecue sauce.
For my next discovery: leftovers!
Did you make a pasta salad, or are we still Paleo?
I forgot to tell you, I discovered fire!
Should I throw another one on the grill?
I know, 15 minutes per pound.  It'll be done next moon, okay?
Good news is it will be rare, medium and well-done at once.
Add this to the list of things we shouldn’t buy in bulk.
On second thought, we should just boil the corn.
Believe me when I tell you - it tastes like chicken!
Don't you dare tell him you wanted white meat!
‘They assured me it was sustainably sourced.’
T-Rex again?
Last night I had a dream about microwave ovens!  And smaller chickens.
Don't worry, it can't run very fast with three.
Just wait...one day I’ll have a franchise
You told me Costco, I went to Costco.
Hey, the cave drawing said to do it low and slow!
At this rate, we will be extinct by dinner time!
It's amazing right!? I call it "fire."
Think there’s a chance we’ll eat before the baby starts walking?
You might as well open that second bag of Kingsford
In my defense, it was part of doorbuster deal at Costco
Your Dad is a leg man
Don’t overcook it. I hate when it tastes all fossilized.
Freeze the leftovers? Oh yeah,  just bring back the ice age."
....the drumstick was easy. Discovering metal fabrication was the tricky bit.
Guess the man cave didn't boost his ego enough.
I'm told it tastes like chicken.
They were going extinct anyway.
Lemme guess, your parents are dropping by?
I know you're hungry guys, but low and slow is how I roll.
Look I'm sorry, Paleo is the only diet that's been invented so far.
Needs a couple more days.
Just a couple more days, kids!
Gonna need more charcoal,hon
When it falls off the bone, it's done.
Stop asking.  It'll be ready when it's ready.
Honey, do we have more BBQ sauce?
It took me all day to invent fire, so yeah, it's still gonna be a while.
Who wants this one?
Not so sure we’re really “grill” people.
Honey, T. Rex ain't got no white meat.
Maybe we'd better go ahead and eat the potato salad.
I already said I'm sorry for leaving the Instant Pot at work.
It's called a "spatula".
We're going to need a bigger gravy  boat.
Really? Mammoth again?
We waited millions of year for fire so you can wait five more minutes for it to finish cooking.
It's not going to cook any faster if you stare at it.”
Maybe we should go back to berries and nuts?
He may not be extinct, but he is well done.
What are you doing?  Did you forget it's Meatless Monday?
One day those big birds will be gone and you'll miss them.
I love the smell of brontosaurus in the morning
Should be ready for Thanksgiving.
Yes, it's heritage breed, organic, hormone free, grass fed, and local.
And there is another one just like this in the freezer.
Would you like to Jumbo Size the fries too?
Why do you always have to go for the Buy  One. Get One free  option.?
Of course, there's no barbecue sauce.  That would be an anachronism.
Is this the biggest spatula we've got?
Drumstick for everyone!
I found it by some ancient relic that says 'Nuclear Reactor' on it
Excuse me. Who INSISTED on free-range, organic?
I'll eat it in the man cave.
I finally caught the costcosaurus.
No, this isn’t Fluffy....
But you know how dry it is when we microwave it.
Hey everybody, I just invented the slow cooker!
Honey, would you check if anyone has invented beer yet?
Don't worry, its all paleo, dear
Everybody likes it rare, right?
This will be even better when they invent barbeque sauce.
Do you want yours rare or extinct?
When I was younger we didn't even have fire to grill
As God is my witness,we'll never be hungry again"
Discovering fire was the easy part.
A few more minutes; you said that yesterday!
This is precisely why you shouldn't grocery shop on an empty stomach.
I know, I know, 165 degrees.
No you may not break the wishbone!  It's holding up Grandmother's room.
It’ll be fine, honey.  It’s paleo.
I told you we should have ordered take out.
It was touch and go for a while, but then I invented fire.
Almost done. Just another two weeks and it will falling off the bone.
I call dibs on the drumstick.
Honey, can you set the timer for the Cenozoic Era?
Sure, NOW you say you want white meat!
You'd better order a pizza
Can you please stop telling me it would be done by now if I'd started the fire when you said to!!!
They were out of mammoth.
Go to bed, this is breakfast.
We would have been eating by now if you let me buy the full size kettle.
It will be ready before the dawn of history.
You couldn’t have told me earlier that you wanted to explore vegetarianism?
Well, then go gather some snacks.
I'm no longer giving completion estimates, OK?
Woman! Quick, paint a picture of this on the wall.
They're extinct now so you better enjoy.
Its almost ready.  Just another couple of days...
Enough with the "Is it done yet
I invented fire, not gas.
Sure they're extinct, but Whole Foods has everything.
The package said no artificial growth hormones...
It’s mostly over indirect heat.
The Neoliths aren't coming. They said they've gone agrarian.
When our guests arrive next week, the meat will be done.
You want vegan, take the kids to your sister's cave
Uh, yeah.  It's vegan.
For future reference, let me know when you've lent out the big spatula.
What the hell you mean, you've decided to go vegan??!?
The white meat has been done for a while.
And then I asked him, 'Why are you crossing the road?'
Who wants another drumstick?
I have an uncanny desire to hold a 12-ounce cylindrical object in my right hand.
I also discovered Costco.
It took him 17 years to get this big so can you wait 2 more minutes until it’s done?
And DON’T tell me you only like white meat!
Don’t put the corn on yet
Let's just call it Beyond Turkey.
You can start the beans at sunrise.
Just a few more days.
Midnight munchies, dear?
Sorry there's only one drumstick. You'll have to share.
This way, there are no fights over the drumstick.
Okay, hon, grab that balsamic reduction for the final touch.
It's Sunday. Chick-fil-A was closed.
Does anybody else want one?
Yes, the coals are hot enough!
I want a gas BBQ for my birthday.
I got the idea from a restaurant review in The New Yorker.
Rare okay?
You always said I was paranoid about growth hormones in our food, but now do you believe me?
I’m thinking late tomorrow afternoon. Do we have another option for tonight?
Hon, I might be here for a bit.  Would you bring me a beer?
What? I'm hungry.
You'll like it. It tastes like what chicken will taste like in the future.
Maybe instead of a spatula you could have bought me a bigger grill.
this one's almost done.  bring me the other leg.
I was the one who suggested burgers; but noooo...you insisted on a drumstick.
It’s my mother’s recipe.
But it's gluten-free!
This is gonna take another couple of days so you may as well go back inside and draw on the walls.
Yeah, but on the bright side by the time it's done we may have gone from Erectus to Sapiens.
I could be the next Iron Age Chef!"
Hey - you want white meat you gotta hunt it yourself
Okay, I've got sort of done, maybe kind of done, and probably not much done at all.
Just be thankful that I'm not cooking it sous vide.
Of course it's free range AND organic. I wasn't born under a rock ... Well ...
Pay attention, kids – someday you'll need to flip a pterodactyl leg with a spatula.
What happens in our diorama........stays in our diorama.
Relax, we're all getting the drumstick.
Another successful Costco outing.
Of course we can all have the leg.
Honey, can you grab the meat thermometer for me?
NOW I wish I had paid extra for the rotisserie
What?? I had a late craving...
Do you want to eat inside or outside?
Just a few more hours, sweetie.
Well done?  Not possible.
It's a Costco chicken
Uh ... no. I haven't seen your pet stegosaurus of late.
It’s not too much, honey! We’ll use it for lunches if we have leftovers.
I think maybe four or five days should do it?
I sometimes think we're taking this paleo diet too literally.
Wow. What happened to rest of him.
I hope everyone likes rare.
Can someone bring me the basting broom?
No, it’s not.
Don’t worry honey, they promised me there were no artificial hormones.
Honey, this is our last leg since the thaw
White Meat??!!
Now you want white meat!
It would help if you didn't just stand there.
Sure, it’s inconvenient, but nothing’s organic at the deli.”
Why do you always have this disapproving look on your face?
Stop sniveling; it was him or me!
We need a bigger grill
Who's for rare?
Yes, Weber is the "Cadillac of Grills." For Titanis Bird, we need "Winnebago of Grills."
No briquettes, no lighter fluid. You tell me how long it's gonna take.
Do you think one is enough?
It's not going to cook any faster by staring at it.
And this was one of the babies.
Last time I send you shopping alone.
Told you I was a leg man.
What? It’s woolly mammoth. It was the last one. I got it on sale.
No, I cannot guarantee it is organic.
Grilling is a process, Helen!
Call me crazy but a good old-fashioned fire would be better.
Next time don’t shop at Costco!
You can come out of the cave now. The pterodactyl won’t be bothering us anymore.
Just think of it like Thanksgiving, but for three years straight.
Over at MacDonald's cave he cooks his in just a couple minutes!
I figure it'll be ready sometime tomorrow.... why?
Carbs were bad for us, honey.
Don't give me grief, they were on sale.
Tell me why I should even bother making a grocery list for you anymore.
You know the Gronks have a gas grill, Sharon...
Shoulda seen the one that got away!
We wanted wings
It finally defrosted.  Goodbye Ice Age...Hello Global Warming.
Next time, let's get the hormone-free pterodactyl legs.
I’m braver than you think. You should have seen this chick’s mother.
Dinner will be ready some time in the late Pleistocene.  The kids can have some chips and queso first.
What do you mean now you’re a vegetarian?
I will have it ready by the bronze age.
Sorry, won’t happen again, it was a close out special, last one, species just went extinct.
I don't want to hear, 'Is it ready yet?'
This is not my idea of  'eating out.'
Next month we'll have dessert.
You can’t get the grill marks if you cook it over an open flame.
I hope dark meat is OK!
It’s the last woolly mammoth, so it’ll be worth the wait.
There's nothing worse than undercooked brontosaurus."
Hunter, gatherer and barbecuer.
Your dinner will be prehistoric.
Sorry - I'll put the white meat on next.  Gimme a couple days.
Must wait. Not want E. coli.
Dinner is almost ready and I hope you like Pterodactyl.
Challenged a T-Rex to an arm wrestling contest, works every time...
I told you I prefer white meat!  What happened to the breast?
Ten more minutes, okay?
Do you want it “crispy” or “original”
You should see the wings.
Velociraptor must be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
It'll be done in the Mesozoic Era.
That’s it for the leftovers.
You said, "Well done."
What do you mean, 'the kids want vegetarian'?
Borgtok, is this our large spatula?
The T-Rex ate the rest...
Do you want burnt or raw?
The other leg got away?
I'm happy as long as you're doing the carving.
Honey, is it too late to order a pizza?
I got tired of being a starving cave artist.
Yes sweetie, you are a true visionary. Now, how about we just get a pizza before we all starve.
This will work a lot better once someone invents beer, mesquite, and fire.
That'll teach 'em to cancel our flight.
Sure, we could eat this. But think about what we can catch with this as the bait.
I told you post-apocalyptic life would be weird.
I don't care if you don't like dark meat!
Go on dear, flip the bird.
Believe or not, someday people will pay a lot of money for a smoked drumstick one-tenth this size.
I forgot to defrost it for 351 hours first!
It's dark meat for the next month guys!
What son mean, he vegan?
Better eat this fast; his mom is right around the corner.
And 66 million years later human beings will wonder what caused the dinosaurs to go extinct.
I’m considering switching from fossil fuels, or, as we call them, fuels.
Ok, ok, it was the managers special
I told you we should have taken the mammoth out of the glacier this morning
And you say I don’t do anything for this family
Because Flintstone got the last rack of ribs at the drive-thru, that's why!
There's more from where this came from.
Don’t just stand there. Bring me the big tongs.
Buying in bulk is cheaper, Ellen
Well Done? Are you serious?
I know it's past dinnertime
You should have gathered more nuts and berries
Look what the meteor shower gave us for dinner tonight.
No, you can only have dark meat!
Gimme a break I only just discovered fire
After the BBQ and the spatula, we’re gonna have to invent beer.”
How do you feel about pterodactyl tartare?
Dinner is going to take a while.
Amazing, isn't it? I'm calling it a 'grill'.
I told you not to shop at Costco.
Don't blame me. You're the ones who wanted dark meat!
So where is this Costco hunting ground?
You guys had better make a start on the roots & berries
It was faster when we ate everything rare.
It was the smallest size available at Costcave.
Just you wait.  Some day, every cave will have one of these babies.
I just discovered fire. Still trying to figure out the time to cook
You've gone vegan - and now you tell me!
It will be done by Wednesday
I'm assuming you bought the extra-large taco shells.
I thought we got past "size matters," Doug.
It'll be a little longer...I got delayed inventing fire.
Yes, dear. I know it has to cook through.
I’ll be glad when these things evolve into chickens
it's grass-fed.
It tastes like chicken, dear
They were on sale at Costco!
Did we get RSVP from the Neanderthals?
Of course it's compatible with the Paleo diet!
You're the one who wants "well done"
They said “it’s so easy a cavemen can do it!”
Not only is it dinner. It deters other dinosaurs.
But we had tyrannosaurus last night!
I remember when these things came in a bucket.
Don't you dare tell me you've gone vegan.
You'll eat dark meat and like it.
It's still gonna be a while, but I gotta say, the pre-seasoning made all the difference this time.
Honey, could you set the timer for 3 moon cycles?
I'm gonna need a bigger spatula.
I SAID, it will be done SOON!
What do you mean you’re a vegetarian?
Give me a break! I just learned how to make fire.
Ok, plant the onions. It should be ready by the end of the month.
Hey, it’s gluten-free.
It's just taking a little longer than I planned.
I couldn’t find Big Foot, but I was able to catch Big Leg.
And what are you three having for dinner?
You can't rush pterfection, kids
Bring me the large spatula please.
I harness fire. I invent barbecue. The least you can do is bring me a cold one.
What year did you say the Joneses were coming?
Look, no one loved Thumper more than I did.
But I wasn't gonna just flush him down the toilet!
It's 3am, Bob. Maybe give up on slow-cooking this?
Quick!  Get a wall drawing of this!
I'm doing the best I can with this primitive grill.
Who likes it rare?
Let the Homo sapiens worry about carbon emissions.
I told you we should get the three-burner grill, but no...
Next weekend - sushi.
I'm gonna need more wood.
Do we have any asparagus?
I told you already. When the moon is full.
Tell the boy child they were out of nuggets.
I could do with bigger tongs, honey.
Everybody gets the drumstick tonight!
You can't rush woolly mammoth.
One taste of my demi-glace and you won’t think it’s pretentious.
We can eat this later. Right now President Trump wants to trace around it to include Alabama in the hurricane warning.
Just two more days.
You get what you get and you don’t get upset.
Honey, did you say 20 minutes per pound?
You could have at least bought a bigger spatula.
Wheel schmeel, this baby is 
the future.
The Pre-American Dream
Let me have this. I gave you my man cave.
I already told you!!  They were out of the white meat....
Honey, when did you take the bird out of the glacier?
Do you honestly think that this is going to cook evenly?
Don't worry about leftovers.  By the time this is finally cooked,the Ice Age should be here.
It's Beyond mammoth
I figured this would put an end to fighting over who eats the drumsticks for a while.
Hunny, of course it’s organic non-GMO.
What do you mean, you want white meat?
You have time to kill a giant chicken and invent the charcoal grill, but can't pick the kids up from school?
We have kids?
Scream if you see a one-legged terror bird hopping around.
Just another 8 hours my dear
Okay, okay . . . so maybe I shouldn’t have jumped at the pre-meteor grill sale.
Do you like it medium rare, or extinct
Next one flies by with a white meat drumstick, I’ll bag it.
Hun, can you gather some spices?
I loved Barney too but he would have wanted it this way.
Be patient. You know the dark meat takes longer.
Of course its soy-based, do I look like a Neanderthal?
I don't care if it's the Ice Age. We're grilling out!
Dinner will be a little late.
Nearly done -  just give it a week.
Save the bone for my crafting!
Trust me it will taste just like Chicken..!!
You stay in there in case he comes around looking for it.
Hey Babe , do you have a 2 ft thermometer?
Do you want the bun toasted?
Well next time you might think twice before making fun of my small spear when I want a new big grill.
Well it took even longer to kill so chill out.
You think this is big, wait til you see what I have planned for the Super Bowl.
We've just discovered fire last week, it's not like I know what i'm doing.
This is an example of biting off more than you can chew.
No!  There’s no veggie option!
Sometime this Millennium would be nice.
Do you have anything plant based?
I think this calls for a nice Bordeaux.
What do you mean that you want a breast?
Um, so we're down to one briquette .. so this may take awhile ..
You should have seen the size of the breast.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it was free range.
We're gonna need a bigger grill.
Don’t tell me now you’ve decided to become a vegetarian.
I know when to flip it.
It'll be done before half time.
And your mother said I 'couldn't bring home the bacon.'
I said to bring home the bacon.
Winner, Winner, Pterodactyl Dinner
I hope you all like the dark meat.
Do you want yours raw or rare?
It was the only part your hunter could gather
You have to admit it, Linda - that nuclear holocaust did have its perks.
I am cooking it slow!
Who gets the drumstick?
Your eyes were bigger than your grill.
Stay there. His mother may come looking.
Who wants the last one? ... It really is the last one!
It's Tyrannosaurus ex.
How do you take it, well-done or Mesozoic?
You all get drumstick.
Trust me, I can't burn it this time.
Just be thankful the big one got away.
I told you not to supersize your order.
The slow food movement is really on trend
See -- this is why we needed to bring the grill.
I know that's what I said last night.
Are you sure you want it Well Done
They were all out of mammoth. I had to get turkey instead.
In a couple of thousand years, people will be walking around state fairs with these.
You want white meat, you drag it home next time!
Snuffy went North to a special farm, kids.
Anyone for tartare?
This was the last T-Rex, so it's going to have to last us awhile.
Sorry, took me longer than I thought to invent fire.
Dining room or al fresco?”
I learned this from that big Monolith that was here last week.”
More wood.
I have to invent fire and do all the cooking?
Yes, I brined it.
They call it a spatula
It's part of the tundra to hovel movement.
Thag hungry too, but Thag know difference between eating and dining.
Could you try not overcooking it, for once??
It's just a midnight snack, don't judge me!
Are the potatoes ready yet?
Is there any more white meat?
Of course, Honey.  Just how you like it.  Charred on the outside, and pink with foot-long parasites on the inside.
I know what I'm doing!
Don’t look at me, you’re the one who wanted to move to the suburbs
It'll be done next week.
No, it’s a smoker. Fire hasn’t been discovered yet.
Whose turn for the drumstick?
I’ve prepared a side of tree.
I told you bone-in would take longer...
What do you mean it's not balanced? It looks balanced to me.
Who wants buffalo wing?
Club Sandwich, anyone?
I’m glad we decided on bone-in.
Yes, Ellen, you ARE right...perhaps I should have spatchcocked it.
First I marinate it in red wine and olive oil with a little rosemary and then I turn it often for three days.
Oh yeah? Be my guest if any of you think you can cook it faster.
We’re looking at about five hours a side.
It's from a new place called Costco
What? They were out of the large.
Oh, order this huge grill on Amazon, you said! Perfect for a paleo diet, you said!
They only had Stegosaurus.
Sorry.  The t-rex got all of the white meat.
I'll need more charcoal.
You may want to order take-out."
Keep an eye out for the rest of him.
It should be done before the next ice age.
You should've seen the size of the chicken
Yes, I killed Big Bird, shut up and eat!
I just turned it. I'll turn it one more time on Tuesday and then it will be ready.
I call it the ‘Impossible Drumstick.’
And then I had an idea for something
I call the “State Fair”
I'm not sure how to flip this...
Costco!
Be patient. Low and slow is the only way to keep it juicy.
It took me ages but I finally got the grill started.
It will be done at high moon.
Yeah, the servings are large, but it's paleo....
It's going to be a few more eras.
Sorry I couldn't carry the filet home but the leg is almost as good.
Dear, do you think dinner will be done before the industrial revolution?
There'll be no arguing over who gets the leg.
What do you mean; "we're out of charcoal"?
Don't be so squeamish. It tastes alot like pterodactyl
What wine goes well with Pterodactyl?
Next year's dinner is almost ready.
I think we're gonna need a bigger grill.
I'm done with that vegan diet!!
I understand you’re hungry, but it took me a little while to invent the fire!
Yes dear, this is organic, free-range and antibiotic free.
I'd say he will have it cooked by next week, so go back to bed.
Oh, you want white meat? He shouldn't be hard to track.
If your brother-in-law hadn't discovered fire, we could have eaten hours ago.
I SURE HOPE YOU ARE IN A FOWL MOOD
No, you dont get a choice. No breast ,no thighs, so deal with it.
Honey, can you please bring out the meat thermometer?
I hope this paleo diet thing is worth it.
I found it near where that meteor hit the other day.
I just don't think we should give up on fire completely until we've given it one last test.
It is the Lower Paleo diet.
Daddy, I'll take a wing.
You better like dark meat.
No, I don't think its grass fed
All of a sudden, I have a hankering for cranberries.
Now you know why I asked for a larger grill for my birthday!
Alton Brown says low and slow is the way to go
Don’t burn it
We're having chicken all month. Deal with it.
I'm a leg man!
Honey, dinner's almost raw.
We're two generations from eating it raw and you're all in a panic it won't be well done.
I still say a volcano gives a more even barbecuing.
How pink is too pink?
We may have to order pizza!
Well then, don't eat it if it's pink!
Next Tuesday there's a special on wing.
Tastes just like chicken.
I wish it felt more like Thanksgiving.
And don't ask me again until Tuesday.
Hey gatherers, the hunter wants a beer.
'He's still tied up in the back. You don't kill a bird like that all at once.'
Trump shares sharpie rendering of Alabama family after Dorian makes landfall in Birmingham.
We can't have potato salad until there's agriculture.
Ok, bring out the wing.
What'll we do now for eggs?
It should be ready in a few eras
There was nothing in the refrigerator
You guys already ate, right?
I guess this is what they mean by 'Beyond Meat.'
Keep an eye out for a one-legged T Rex.
It's cheaper in bulk.
Did you forget to defrost it again?
Gimme a break—fire was only invented last week!
I am committed to my new diet and yes, that does include period dress and housing.
Guess what I want for Father's Day
Sorry, folks. Dinner will be another six hours or so.
I wish you hadn't named her.
The packaging said to heat thoroughly ...
You know what they say about the megafauna: easy to kill, tough to grill... ehehe
'... I know, but there was next to nothing on the arms.'
We can have it for breakfast with the egg it laid.
Yes, honey, I know that last time it was still pink on the inside.
Whaddya mean you've gone vegan?
I don’t care if we never coexisted with it. Do you want to eat or not?
This was all I could carry home.
I call it "Impossible Drumstick".
Yes, dear, it's free-range and organic.
It just makes me feel like a man.
Naw, the rest of him got away.
If you want it faster, next time let me buy a bigger grill.
Do you want it rare?
If you think this is big, you should have seen its' parents.
So we'll have leftovers.
Looks like we found your pet terodactyl.
It's supposed to be funny -- it's my drumshtick.
It should be done in 4 suns.
Please tell me you're okay with rare.
It was your idea to live off the grid.
Honey. We are tired of the paleo diet.
As long as you were at it, could you have invented a larger grill?
No, Gorb got the breast.
You mean I gotta wait ten thousand years for my cold beer?
It’s going to be a few minutes - I JUST discovered fire.
Only a few more days on each side.
They were having a "soon-to-be-extinct" sale at the supermarket.
Nothing beats a free-range organic stegosaurus leg.
It would have been ready sooner but it took all morning to discover fire
No, we are not ordering a pizza.
Because they were out of Stegosaurus breasts, O.K.?
Wait until you see tomorrow's omelette!"
Don't forget to turn it!!!
You think fire so simple?  fire complicated!  You reason why woman will never cook!”
Next time, don't go to Costco
When we remodel the patio, I'd like a bigger grill
Sorry, there's no room for a veggie dog.
Thursday, I said. Thursday! Today is Tuesday
Can't it be a little pink?
I’ve heard it tastes just like chicken
Now that we can cook with fire, it’s time to invent gender stereotypes.
Why woman stand there? Go invent potato salad.
Honey!  Where is the other drumstick?
dinner's ready
Ready in a week!
Wait till you see the rump roast!
Don't worry, chickens and dinosaurs are related.
It's done when it's done.
Patience - there's no such thing as fast food on the Paleo Diet.
Will dinner be ready before the pleistocene age ends?
Don’t worry, you’ll like it— tastes just like chicken.
Sick of Mastadon? Be careful what you wish for...!
The Mastadon would have been too gamey
Please get the T-rex arms next time.
Where's that pterodactyl baster we got from Williams Sonoma?
Don't worry.  It'll be ready by Thanksgiving.
How's the potato coming?
So easy a caveman can do it? Yeah, keep dreaming Marvin.
It may be faster to wait for the invention of the car and drive to a restaurant.
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, I invented coal.
Someone's not worried about their carbon footprint.
Yes dear, of course its grass-fed.
Is ice age, Karen. Still frozen in middle.
No worries! Ten hours - tops.
You think this will be enough?
Why do you always let your brother have the breast meat?
Yes, it's leftovers again. If you don't like what I'm hunting, why don't you try going out and doing some gathering?
Are the potatoes ready?
So easy, even a caveman can do it
Let me know when the salad’s ready
Does anybody NOT like the drumsticks?
Have we discovered tongs yet?
Two more minutes.
You can't rush these things...."
This ‘mine has to be bigger’ thing has gone way too far.
I gave up my cave.  I draw the line at my grill.
What? You were the one who said, 'No big gas grill! We're not Neanderthals!'
It’s new.  They call it “Costco.”
Looks like another minute...
Dark meat again?
Just about three more hours, if I can figure out how to turn it.
Five more hours, then we'll do the other side.
Yeah this is fire model 3.
This one will take a little longer. 
Snack on some healthy fruit til its done.
Don’t worry. What ever I’m compensating for, probably hasn’t been invented yet.
Just wait. The Gatherers will all be like hey bro,'sup?
Barbaric-que!
Come help me turn this thing!
Any chance of us eating that thing before it fossilizes?
I know it's primitive, but my sous vide is broken.
The rest is in the freezer.
Growth Hormones...
Go back inside. If you're lookin', you're not cookin'.
But, Honey, you promised barbecue WINGS tonight!
You know -this fella didn't just rollover and die. Soooo, we'll eat when it's good and ready.
Next time, hunt for rabbits.
The bad news is it's the last one.
You need to be done with this paleo diet.
Why can’t you invent something useful like the wheel?
Perhaps it would be quicker to just invent agriculture.
Almost ready. I’m just gonna give it another lunar cycle on this side.
Teradactyl Again
Go ahead and start without me.
Barney? Haven't seen him. Why do you ask?
Didn't we have diplodocus last night?
What're you guys having?
You should've seen Ralph's!
I can't promise it'll be tender; I didn't have time to brine it.
Well if you had let me get the bigger grill it wouldn't be taking so long.
Oh, Ted! Honestly. Just bring it and stick it in the microwave.
It's a Big Game Night!
Ha ha very funny. Yes, it’ll be done before the Neolithic era.
You're going to have a drum stick, and you're going to like it!
What do you mean vegans?!
After fire and iron, what did you expect?
I hope everybody’s hungry!
If you had bought the extra large green egg we would be eating right now .
Any minute.
The directions from Blue Apron were very clear. Medium rare is 140 degrees.
If only we lived in the convection age.
You want the honey-glazed turnips or three-bean salad with this?
Who wants theirs tartare?
These new meal kits do the hunting FOR you!
First things first.  I'll invent the wheel tomorrow.
It should be done later in the week.
Who wants rare?
We're going to need a bigger habachi.
I have a bone to pick with you.
It should be ready by the Pleistocene era.
The next one who says they want white meat gets extinct.
A watched dino leg never grills.
We should get a rotisserie and a chain saw.
I know you're hungry, Karen. I gathered that.
I also discovered the marshmallow.
You want fries with this?
I’ll give it a few more minutes.
I know it's big, but the price per pound was way cheaper than the smaller ones.
You're the one who wanted it well done.
This should taste like chicken....
I'm telling you, it's going to be under-done.
What do you mean: "Don't overcook it!"
Let's have pterodactyl, you said. I'm really craving pterodactyl, you said.
Now I know why it’s called “Labor Day”.
We're hunter gatherers.  What makes you think that either of us knows how to cook?
Should we sous vide the rest?
Don't tell me it tastes like chicken.
I know, I know, I'll start the grill earlier next time.
Let's not tell anyone this is the last of the dinosaurs.
Yes honey, I hear you. I'll be able to do that after the next 1,000 years of adaptive evolution.
You've been cooking that thing since the Ice Age.
Oh,great time to tell me you want medium rare!
Dad, I know this might be inconvenient but I have decided to become a vegetarian
Are you OK with rare?
Weber Grills have been around longer than we have..
Can someone get me some Pterodactyl sauce?
Where's the rest?  You know the kids only like wings.
Yeah, you've got about 3 weeks to get those mashed potatoes ready.
You said, 'Go big or go home.'
I've got to get it started now.  Thanksgiving is already less than three months away.
Why can’t you crave chocolate at night like the other wives?
You wanted the Paleo diet, you got the Paleo diet!
Y’all could at least go gather a few cranberries.!
It'll be ready by the full moon.
Let's eat outside tonight.
Why didn’t you tell me earlier you like the white meat?
Do you want non-GMO food or do you want to survive?
We dine at sunrise!
It’s called fire.  They were giving away samples at Costco.
You still like yours rare?
I'll just cook it all and then we'll have leftovers for winter.
What’s with the look? You were the one who wanted a drumstick, the brain would have been done hours ago.
Well,that's the last of 'em. Don't have to deal with this anymore. Thank goodness for extinction.
I'll tell you what's taking so long...we should have brined it first."
As it turns out, size matters.
I don't care what you heard from the media! There are plenty of the Giant Turkey to eat, saying they are endangered is fake news!
Would it have killed you to gather some mesquite?
Kids, I think if drumsticks ever evolve to a smaller size, you’re daddy’s new barbecue invention will really catch on.
Wait until you see the eggs in the morning.
Sam's club.
I guess we are having company for the next month.
Daddy can invent the metal grill, but he still can't finish dinner before the Holocene epoch.
Before we dig in, two words:  portion control.
I repeat: a Brontosaurus is not a pet.
I think it'll be alright to eat with our fingers just this once.
I'm so tired of your gatherer thing.
About a week and a half.
This old grill is prehistoric.
Do I have to tell you every time that there's no white meat on a T. Rex?
I don’t know what gravity is, but I’m pretty sure this is defying it.
So rare it is!
Consider yourselves lucky I didn't get the Breast.
Yes, it is free-range
Just because we discovered fire doesn't mean I'm going to cook the chicken any faster.
I'm sorry, guys.  This plant-based diet thing just felt wrong from the beginning
Relax! It'll cook down.
If you’d gotten me the larger grill, we could’ve eaten hours ago.
Where's a volcano when you need one?
I gotta tell ya, I love cooking with this new 'fire' method.
Now that you've gotten the hang of grilling a drumstick can you now try some wings?
It took longer than I thought it would to invent the fire.
Honey, they call it the Paleo diet
Discovering fire took longer than I thought.
Maybe we should butcher them when they’re younger.
Honey, you know we don't like dark meat.
I knew what they said about fire was just an advertising gimmick.
Honey, it's OK. The recommended daily intake of protein is just a guide.
They get smaller every year.
Enjoy, after this they're extinct.
Breast my ass.
Hone, can you go to the volcano and get some hot sauce.
Hungry?
Look Karen, the Chernobyl chicken was half off today, it's free range too.
Anyone remember how to gather?
So dinner will be a little late.  Not like it's the end of the world.
The least you could do is invent some plates.
Honey, we haven't invented farming yet.  It's all free range.
No, we're not inviting your mother. This is prime Mastodon!
Chances are they won’t have pterodactyl at the solstice pot luck.
Well dang. I should have invented tongs instead of the spatula. .
Well, your brother's got my good dinosaur grill.
Anachronism, shmanachronism.... who wants dark meat and who wants light?
I know they're going extinct, but I just can't eat another plant-based burger
I know it’s late but I was in the mood for extra-crispy.
Hey, it would have been done long ago if I had a good gas grill.
Trust me, it’s almost done.
It may be a while--I'm trying the indirect heat method.
It's still pink in the middle.
Sorry, kids. The T Rex got the breast.
I hope you're hungry - ever since the end of the Ice Age it's been almost impossible to keep leftovers.
How do you like your t-Rex cooked: rare, medium rare, extinct?
We're fine, I swear. It's completely plant-based.
Way I look at it, we're the endangered species.
Your always complaining about not enough protein.
Is the Béarnaise sauce ready?
It's gonna be awhile.  The guy in the store forgot to tell me to discover fire first.
So I says, 'It's not an anachronism, it's an ana-cro-magnonism.'
I told you we should have bought the bigger grill
So,who's up for rare?
Of course I tipped the delivery guy!
I was hunting for grills all day. This was the only one I could catch.
Let's see what the gatherers do with this.
I just hope he doesn't come looking for his leg.
Get the cauliflower rice ready!
Yeah, well, Grogg's woman didn't buy him the store brand lighter fluid did she?
Dark meat or dark meat?
The guests left two days ago.  But we're still waiting, mister Early Adopter.
I hope you’re not expecting side dishes for that.
Honey, that dinosaur was sustainably sourced, right?
I hope everybody likes dark meat.
After this, I think we should try that vegan thing.
This should be enough for us, your mother and your grandgorilla.
Thanks to that meteor, we'll have food for a week!
It was 30% off.
Hey. We're lucky I got the leg. Grok and his family are having 
more unfortunate cuts of Woolly Mammoth for dinner.
You might want to have a snack. The briquettes won't be ready until the mesozoic era.
This may not be ready until the moon is full.
You know what they say about Big Foot...big legs.
Can I call Domino’s now? We can leave that for the next time your family comes over.
OK, it'll be another week.  Eat the leaves.
It’s been 2 days, Grok. The kids are really hungry.
It’ll be ready in about three days....give or take.
I think you should've thawed it first.
I know, I know..... I should  have gotten the gas grill.
This is it until organic produce becomes Man's greatest discovery.
Grab me the woolly mammoth rub, honey.
You want rare or extra rare?
It's progressive. The Lunk's have the other leg, the Clog's have the breast, the Dorf's have the wings, and the DeLuca's are bringing pasta.
Yes Barb, it's free range AND non-gmo.
I had to get this size--otherwise we wouldn't get the discount.
It was a hell of a fight. Wish your dad could have been here to enjoy the spoils of his hunt.
Are you sure barbecuing is 'the way of the future of man'?
I killed it so I’ll cook it how I like it.
Outdoor grilling is great, but I miss the shadows on the cave wall when you used to cook inside.
No, I'm afraid tofudactyl isn't on the menu.
Maybe we should just scramble some eggs.
I know, I know - we need to breed them smaller.
It's way better than Jurassic Pork
I fought Glog for the white meat, but he won.
Medium rare is fine at this point.
Do you have a vegan option?
Dinner will be served soon. Another two days max.
Grok, don't be such a Neanderthal! What part of "we are vegan" do you not get?
Laugh at me now, one day, some place named Disney will be selling lots of these.
We are going low carb
Go big or go home. Therein lies the conundrum.
Didn't I tell you to order the mammoth-size grill?
You should’a seen the legs on that thing.
Farm raised?  What's a farm?
We need to gather a bigger grill.
Sorry guys, that damned Pterodactyl was larger than I thought.
Did you order - Hot, Medium, Mild or the Original?
I will call this the paleo diet
Chickensaurus again?
They were able to back order the grill to 11,000 BC but they only had the small.
Me discover fire! Least you can do is discover patience!
The guy at the store said these things are flying off the shelves like there’s no tomorrow.
We need to get a bigger grill!
I think I got a leg up on this one.
Yeah yeah, I’m an emotional eater. 
So what?
I'm just saying, could you see a Neanderthal doing something like this
You forgot the kids' cereal & milk again? Why do i bother to chisel out a list?'
You're only telling me now that you don't like dark meat?
You said “10 more minutes” 5 hours ago.
I'm waiting for the juices to run.
Regular or extra crispy?
After grilling, I'll finish it on the stove top with a little red wine reduction with minced chives in a saucier pan.
Honey, the children aren't hungry - they're just fascinated as to where he pooped.
I told you we should have parboiled it first.
Geez dad, by the time that thing is done, they will have invented the microwave “
Once Fluffy was too big for the cave ...
Who knew the 'Flintstone Reality Park' would be this good?
Is that still frozen from the ice age?
It’s for The Renaissance Festival.
We've painted all the walls already.  I can't stall them any longer.
This is a fine time to tell me you've gone vegan.
Look, I hunt, you gather. That's the deal. You got a berry that'll go with this, bring it out, Sharon.
Dinner’s gonna be a little late.
Would it kill you to make sides?
Did you really think we wouldn't notice?
Then go out and buy more tupperware
This was all that was left when I got there.
The vegan's next door are complaining again.
Hold your horses, the dark meat takes longer!"
I wish you had let me get the big barbecue.
Nearly time to gather some salad!
It was him or me...
Was that cage-free?
I said 'Organic'  not 'Gigantic'
That new Costco is a real game changer.
I don't know what it is.  The guys told me it tastes like chicken.
Do you want it rare, or rare?
It’s actually Tofusaurus - but it tastes just like meat.
You’re the one who asked for a mammoth meal.
Hurry up! It’s on the endangered species list!
I'm using Dinnersaurus Rex's recipe. We'll be eating by Thursday.
Eh, you sure you don't want it done rare?
It should be ready Tuesday.
Give me a break, I only discovered fire yesterday.
Could you invent me a plate?
I told you deep frying it would be quicker .
We were thinking Chinese tonight.
Before the discovery of fire, you were all satisfied with raw.
I really wish she’d stop buying everything at Costco!
Just make sure it’s cooked to 165 degrees at the thickest part.
If I had known it was going to take this long, I would 've ordered takeout.
This is what civilized eating is all about.
If you think this leg is impressive, you should have seen her breasts and thighs!
I'll be glad when you get around to inventing box wine.
With bread? It’ll never catch on.
The Johnson’s cave came with a built-in grill.
Just another 16 hours or so.
Now maybe you'll admit that getting a bigger grill isn't just 'keeping up with the Oopses'.
I don't care, we're still not inviting the Wilsons.
I'm sure your grill is a wonderful invention, but I think it would work much better if you had discovered fire first.
I think that we are going to need a bigger barbecue
No -- white meat will be next month
You want it well done?
Just think, if things had worked out differently we'd be eating giant omelettes instead
I saw an incredible recipe for blackened Pterodactyl thigh in this month’s issue of Bon Appeptit
There's more where this came from...
Next time we'll get delivery.
These Carboniferous Period briquettes are garbage!
Stop your salivating and go to bed! This is tomorrow’s breakfast.
If you see a one legged pteranodon, you don't know me, you've never met me.
Medium raw tonight.
Who's gonna want seconds, thirds and fourths?
Don't worry about leftovers, I have a feeling that Mammoth meat can safely stay frozen for a very long time.
Yes, there’s time to have the appetizers first.
It's just a prototype, it's not to scale.
I have to ensure that the juices caramelize and the skin crisps, don’t look at me like that.”
Everyone gets "rare" so don't bug me.
If he buys us, Trump says , " 'UGE chicken in every pot!"
We’ll need a side dish.
And you decide to go vegan... now?
Listen, if it's not cooked all the way through we'll all be Jurassick.
This, plus that wheel idea I’m working on... Voila. . . tailgating
I said it will be done WHEN IT'S DONE
We're eating paleo this week.
No need to fight over the drumstick, there’s plenty to go around!
Please tell me you wanted dark meat.
I hope you like chicken cause we'll be eating it for the next 4 months
Sorry, it's not safe until it's 165 degrees on the inside.
I think we're going to need some more briquettes...
New hunting ground. Costco.
This month we eat drumstick.  Next month wings.  The breast is for the winter.
Only a few more days then we can eat.
But we’re vegan!
Ever since he went to that renaissance festival it’s been humongous turkey leg this and humungous turkey leg that
This free range diet preoccupation of yours has gone too far.
No, you can't have white meat.
I'm grilling here, it's not barbecuing unless actual barbecue sauce is involved.
I’m not sure we can support one more person in the village doing this keto thing
I guess the discovery of fire was only half the battle.
I told you,it's the paleo diet!
Julia Child said to do it this way  ! ! !
Wait till you see the zucchini.
But Junior wanted drumsticks to start a band.
I call it Original Recipe.
Don't worry. It's free range all right ...
You do know that the dark meat takes longer to cook.
We haven't invented the concept of Time yet, but fifteen minutes on either side, tops.
Could be worse. Could be a mastodon leg
Yes, I'm sure it's done all the way through.
No, it's not Big Bird.
Who likes dark meat?
What day did you say the dinner guests will be coming?
I know we had Tyrannosaurus last night. It's called leftovers.
And what did YOU do all day?
Well if YOU had given me the grill I wanted for my birthday, it would have been done by now!
Of course I let it thaw overnight!
Now let's get a head count: who wants a drum stick?

It's almost done.  Give it another four days and then set the floor.
Camille Adams, Atlantic Beach, F
Seriously? Squabbling over who gets the drumstick?"
Just needs about another 1,500 minutes or so.
and boy, that suckah could fly
I think I'm going to call it "The Paleo Diet"
Left leg...right leg? I don't know.

Dear,it's George Foreman returning your message"
I know we're vegetarians, but a little meat won't kill us!

Rare, rarer, rawest?
Who wants the first piece of "flying death monster"?

Honey, why can't you remember the kids and I went vegan?
Now do you know why you married me?
You can stop pretending, I found the take-out bags in the trash.
Yes, the skin will be crispy

I found this Weber grill in an old archeological dig, looks like our ancestors were very proactive
How do you like your Mac Mastodon, rare or well-done?
I'll help get the kids to bed as soon as I finish grilling
Dad's probably going to grill every night before the ice age hits.
Meat from an extinct species takes a little longer.
It was the smallest they had, and we’re lucky it’s not a dinosaur leg.
Don’t look at me, the ‘Buzzard Wing Special,’ doesn’t run that often.
Don't start with me Madison, I'm not the one who forgot the propane.
We didn’t last this long by NOT cooking our meats through.
The spatula's for wafting meat vapours toward our vegan neighbours.
This way we can have leftovers.
You're right. It's like when the mammoth dogs come in packs of ten, but the buns come in packs of 8.
And then we brine our Rex Drumlette in the sea for 24, up to 30 days ...
I hope you're all hungry

Please tell me we have barbecue sauce.
This new fire thing really does make a difference. The secret is controlling the intensity of the flame.
Sorry. There is no 'white meat.' Hunter-gatherers can't be choosers.
This would cook quicker if we invented fire first.
I invented fire for this?
I've wanted to try the plant-based teratorn wing for the longest time.
The First Dad Joke:
10 Million BC:
Thursday: 
"I'm just getting a leg up on the barbecue."

One day these dinosaurs will evolve into something smaller we can barbecue.
Probably about Friday.
You can start the stuffing in about a week.
You sent me to Costco for turkey legs. We'll be eating by Thursday. What did you expect ?
It just needs a few more...days.

These GMOs are really getting out of hand.
I found it in the Paleo aisle.
Actually the sous vide was even harder.
Sure, the brontosaurus leg is amazing, but wait till I tell you where I got this grill.
We're getting very weak, honey.  How much longer for dinner?

Wrong! More is more.
So, what are you guys gonna have?
Everything's bigger in T-Rexus
I forgot to thaw it.
Meatless?! I thought everyone liked Mammoth Mondays.
Just keep an eye out for that angry one legged bird.

How many bags of charcoal do we have left?
Look, if we're going paleo we've gotta commit.
Why didn't you tell me the Petersons were vegetarians?
Be patient – you have to cook poultry thoroughly.

Let's call it a night.  We'll have it for breakfast.
Do we have any brontcosaureus sauce?
Sorry, but you just can't rush Pterodactyl...
Ok! Ok! Order pizza, again! But it's my meateater image that pays the bills!
What else am I supposed to do with fire?
I think we’re going to need a bigger grill.

By the time it's done we'll be Vegans.
I suppose you’re going to tell me the Flintsones got the last rack of ribs again.

You asked for "well done", now you have to wait!
Just hold your horses!  I'm sure it'll be done by Tuesday.
Complain! Complain!  Just remember how good these mammoth legs taste when they're cooked right!
It will take 3 hours to cook that leg but last the whole winter!
Yabba-Dabba Do! I’m cooking Perodactyl for you.
We all know that the required minimum internal temperature for pterodactyl is 85C.
Pterodactyl  wings were on special at Cave Mart.
It was on sale at Costco.
Yes!   Yes!  Of course there were two.
My diet starts tomorrow.

More 15 minutes darling.
Maybe we should start with dessert. This is gonna take awhile.
It’ll just be another six hours.
You should have told be beforehand that you wanted it breaded.

I hope you guys are hungry.
I’ve always said that your father’s cooking will be the death of us.”

This should be ready in a couple of days.
As Burnham wrote, make no small plans.
Glad you did not get the breast!

Forage this, bitches.
You need to invent a bigger grill.
Paper plates will do fine, Hon
Pterodactyl pairs well with organic quinoa and kale.
It's called the Paleo diet. . .
It'll be big-time in two million years.

You wanted well done, you‘ll get well done.
I already called dibs on the drumstick.

It'll just be 500 more minutes.
Looks like we’ll be eating leftovers for a while.
I should have thawed first.
Just be patient. It has to be 165 degrees before I can serve it.
Go ahead with the hors d'oeuvres and spinach salads, don't wait on me! This was the largest grill they had at ACE.
Hey Honey, put “meat thermometer” on the shopping list.
You have to eat all your dinner before you get any dessert.
It’s taking a little longer than I expected; I know you don’t like it too rare.
Next time get the baby moas !
Hang in there. Only another six hours.
Your mother is coming for dinner.
I think we're taking this Paleo diet a bit far, don't you think?
Honey, go kill a deer. With Daddy's quaint little invention, 
dinner will  be ready in about 50,000 years.
I know, I know, but the white meat was all gone by the time I got there.
Well I don't have any Impossible burgers.
Dinner will be ready in about three  moons.
What'd ya mean, we're out of pterodactyl sauce?
This paleo diet sure is big on meat.
I should have asked for the kabobs.
My trainer says I can have cheat meal once a week

You should see the one that got away.

The directions said cook from frozen
I followed the assembly instructions on the wall.
I decided we should go on a full Paleo diet.
If you are all this hungry and impatient, then we should just do the rest in the microwave.

Share? Nah, that sounds way too socialistic to me.
It's gonna take a couple of days longer than I thought.
Be patient- it’ll be an era.
Do you think that at least will be ready for brunch tomorrow?
I killed it, I drug it home, I'm cooking it, and now you're saying you'd rather have ribs?
It's paleo.
I had to skin and clean it so I want the drumstick"
I need one big plate or fifty small plates.
Chicken’s almost done. Can you bring out the burgers?
Our Paleo diet isn't specific on portion size.
Just an idea...I’m going to call it Ren Fest.
Whaddya mean, you want breast meat.
Now that I perfected the recipe they're extinct.
Dinner will be a little late tonight.
Sorry ,I don't do Vegan!
It's not my fault you asked for well-done.
Honey, I honestly think that this whole paleo thing has got some real legs.
See Mary, I told you the Keto diet wouldn't be that hard.
I know we have enough, but I still don't want your mother to join us.
Be patient I forgot to defrost!
It's taking longer than I expected
Medium rare?! What are you, Neanderthals?
You wanted to eat out, so here you go...we’re outside.
Dinner will be ready just before full moon.
What do you mean you're tired of the Paleo Diet?
Yeah, I know it's a bit big but the extra large were on sale.  You know anyone you want to ask over for barbecue? It should be ready early next week.
Madge,you got any more barbecue sauce in there?
I shopped at Costco.
What do you mean "share."
The doctor said to watch my cholesterol so I got the Beyond Brontosaurus.
I don’t know what it is, but I’m irresistibly drawn to stand before it.
Honey, will you grab me that 5 gallon bucket of barbecue sauce.

We're going to need a bigger fire pit

I will NOT put that on my fine China, Roger!
How rare do you like your velociraptor?
Wait until you see the main course!
Let's just say it's a mammoth undertaking.
You can't rush barbecue, Suzzane!
Okay, Helen, you were right — we need a new stove.
I am going as fast as I can on one leg
Of course it's free range; you don't get drumsticks this big from CAFO dinosaurs.
I keep telling you, it's not the size of the BBQ, it's how much charcoal you have.
You’re all good with dark meat?
Who wants first dibs on the drumstick?
What did you expect, hamburgers and hot dogs? That's so 20th century.
It came to me when I rubbed that monolith.
If you stopped buying groceries in bulk, maybe dinner would be ready Carol!
We can walk around and eat this at the State Fair.
You're the ones who wanted the drumstick.
What are you going to invent next, a heated box
I cut up the rest and put it in the freezer
This is the grill of the future.
Hun, we are all starving and it’s way past their bedtime
You all like dark meat, right?
Thog, bring me the thermometer.  I want to make sure the internal temperature is at least 165 degrees.
Who brought the sides?
Honey, do we have any more of that barbecue sauce?
The charcoal grill will go down as man’s greatest discovery.
Well done by the end of the week
I know, I know, my new grill and utensils are just too ahead of our times and I need to stick to inventing the wheel first.
How many bags of charcoal briquettes do we have?
I figured we'd better cook it before it hit the expiration date.
Make a salad.
I'm trying out a new one-pot meal recipe.
I didn't invent fire so you could lecture me about when to take the mammoth off the grill.
I'm waiting for the other leg to drop.
Well, this is the last one we could find on the planet, so I thought we would use that special sauce.
I told you to get chicken strips.
Sorry, no white meat until next week when I can go hunting for the rest of him.
I warned you not to go after Big Foot.
The recipe said one drum stick per person...
Everything about this dinner is anachronistic."
It's "pterodactyl" with a "p".
Painting all those animals made me hungry.
Be patient - it's evolving.
Sorry, but I like my mammoth well-done.
OK, almost done, now bring me a wing!
No. You cannot have the wish bone.
Do I hear a drum roll?
It’s still not done. Guess we’ll have to get pizza.
Don't worry - it's Beyond Pterodactyl Paleo edition..
If you go invent agriculture we can have something to eat with it for the next two months.
I told you I need a bigger grill.
A drumstick’s a drumstick, Helen.
It's a big hit at all of the county fairs, so quit complaining.
Weber need make bigger grill...
It'll be ready next Tuesday."
And after we eat it, I'll use the carcass to settle scores.
No, its not vegan, but it's gluten free.
Hey, getting the potato salad was your job!
Good thing those time travelers left this fire machine here.
I hear it tastes like woolly mammoth.
The meat department manager said this might be the last dinosaur leg available for a long time.
You can’t rush genius!
I think it is time to pass around the canapes.
Don’t worry about where the rest of the chicken is!  This is food, not a logic problem.
The convection oven doesn't brown meat nearly so well.
Where's the meat thermometer ? I think it's done !
It's organic and it was on sale. Any other questions?
Yes, I used your secret recipe of herbs and spices.
It's possible I should have invented the fridge first.
Okay, I'll admit I may have been wrong for making fun of your Tupperware party.
Price Chopper had a great sale!
I've got a leg over you!
Will somebody please bring me the meat thermometer?
?
I killed it, I'll burn it if I want to.
I’m starting my diet tomorrow!!
Trust me,this grass fed mammoth is worth the wait
It's taking longer to cook than I expected.
Don't ask me where I got it.
What do you mean you are sick of the Paleo diet?
Dinner won't be ready for a few million years. We need to wait for coal to form.
I gathered it from Costco.
Are you sure this has to be well done?
The kids can keep playing. Dinner won't be ready for a few weeks.
You’ll thank me when you don’t have to cook after work all week.
Almost done... sorry, breakfast got delayed!
But today is my cheat day.
I don't think we made enough barbeque sauce
I told you they weren't extinct."
Sorry, the breast was already taken; that’s all that was left.
If the mammoths don't die out soon, Thanksgiving's gonna be a beast.
We're vegans "
done by next moon
Dinner will be ready in a couple of moons.
Just another 4 to 6 months
Be a few days.
I thought you said Buffalo pterodactyl LEG!
Don't give me that look.  You know we only eat free range pterodactyl.
I can't wait until I get my larger new Weber grill.
And they said Big Foot wasn’t real!
I think we'll call this Turkey Day
Igor said it was from a Costco-saurus.
Chick-fil-A? Popeye's? Bite me!
I know that the Stone Age is almost over! But fast food has not been invented yet.
I forgot the thermometer
We told you we didn't want Mammoth!
Could you check tracking and see if our new BBQ is out for delivery today?
Stop asking when, it's going to be ready when it's ready.
I've been wanting to try the Paleo diet and finally took the plunge.
How do you want it?  Raw, Rawer or Rawest?
‘Don’t just stand there. Sharpen your teeth.’
You said we needed moa to eat. So here's some moa.
Glibf forhd cradta drandel, berg? {Translation impossible because the caveman Rosetta stone has not yet been found}
Bring me an egg.
No ,I said medium raw.
You want yours without fur? Now you tell me!
It'll be ready next week.
Don't tell me you finished that breast already.
I love the new grill, honey. Did you keep the dainty little receipt?
Set bones aside for museum.
If you keep this up they won't survive the Cretaceous Period.
You only brought home one drumstick for all of us?
Is the potato salad ready?
Sorry, there's no white meat.
This takes all the fun out of hunting and gathering.
Look, if you really wanted to eat before next week, you should have let me buy the big grill.
But, the breasts were too expensive.
Uh, you know we don't have a freezer for leftovers.
It’s called portion control
This only way to celebrate end of  Mesozoic.
Hope everyone is hungry!
What do you mean you don’t like dark meat?
No, it’s not done yet. Yes, I will cook it well, and yes, it will taste just like chicken. Now quit bothering me. I have to focus.
What do you mean,”We’ve run out of barbecue sauce?”
What are “carbs”?
I thought they said it was hormone-free!
For Father’s Day I’d like a larger grille.
Long trip home -- I ate the feathers.
Or do you prefer white meat.
They’ll be plenty for leftovers.
If you want a breast, you'll have to fight the Allosaurus for it.
Don't worry, it will taste like Pterodactyl.
What?  Now you want white meat?
It'll be ready in an age or an era, whichever comes first.
If you want gravy with this, you’re gonna need a bigger boat.
It'll be ready in about 7 hours!
I say its woolly mammoth, and I say the hell with it.
It's for the Iowa State Fair!
Yes it is Paleo. By definition!
You know that Daddy always gets the big piece of chicken.
Just be thankful it didn't eat us.
I knew when we met, you'd be w wonderful provider!
I hope it's not too late to order take-out.
I got this idea from the "Slow Cooked Pterodactyl" recipe tablet
Didn't Costco have anything smaller?
Wait 'til you see the s'mores!
Sides?
Glad I bought this grill before fire was invented...I got a great deal on it.
And, what are the rest of us supposed to eat for dinner?
Still a little red next to the bone.
Any minute now!
I’m going out for berries, by the time that’s done we’ll all be fossils.
Costco had a special. With every drumstick you got a grill”
After this, I'm going vegan.
Dad is taking this Keto thing a little far
It's free range!
No, Junior, you can’t “have the leg”.
It’s from the artisanal hunter’s market, I’m not rushing it...
Coming soon: "Jurassic Pork"
Mine’s almost done. You should get your’s ready while the coals are still hot.
Yes of course it’s free range.
Why don't we start with the salad?
Are we that small or is this a giant leg?
I’m just getting a head start.  You did say your mother was coming?
If it ain’t barbecue, it ain’t food.
The bird leg roast will be done by breakfast.
Who wants medium and who wants well?
So, you all want the dark meat, or the dark meat?
Get the kids inside and bring me my spear. I hear that clucking noise again.
If we weren't on the Paleo Diet, imagine how big a bun you'd have to make for this thing.
We only got dark meat tonight. He got away from me, hopping on one leg, using my oviraptorosauras bone as a crutch.
I wish we had one of the gas ones.
They don't make these Webers like they used to.
When family want “well done” morning fireball must rise three time!
I didn't think it would take so long to cook...
The dear departed hunters Ork, Zok, and Groot made this BBQ possible.
These Ice Age drumsticks always take a little longer to cook. Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Where did our pet dinosaur go dad?!
It's done when it's done, OK? You got it? Have some carrots and fucking hummus if you're that fucking hungry — JESUS CHRIST!
OK, I admit I much prefer "bone-in."
It got away so I went to Costco.
That’s it for this year, kiddos.
It's part of my new Paleo diet.
Daddy will be able to cook much faster once the gas line gets installed
We're off Paleo. We're doing Mediterranean now, dear.
If you call me "Jurassic" one more time, you'll do all the cooking.
It's a buffalo wing.
You're the one who wanted the Paleo Diet.
You should see the t bone
How should I know what happened to your pet dinosaur?
Yes, I know you asked for white with less saturated fat.
Yes, a gas grill would be faster but those don’t exist yet.
It’s no baby, it’s the calf of a mammoth.
Let's order a pizza.
It  will tide is over the winter
I'm going to need more barbecue sauce.
Mitch, I thought we agreed on mo more hunting or gathering in the Oversized Birds section
Just a little longer - at least it's faster than before they invented fire.
This wouldn't fit in the slow cooker.
This move towards miniaturization will take some time to adjust to
"Looks like there can be smoke without fire.
Diner will be ready in 10 to 15 hours.
Set the table. Only 17 more hours until dinner is ready.
I thought we’d try eating Paleo tonight.
Fred, I know that you have a leg up on Barney, but the kids needs to eat tonight!
Remember there’s no potato salad tonight—we’re going paleo.
‘The spatula is for keeping the flies at bay.’
In six hours just give it a flip
I stone aged it in a little Pterodactyl sauce.
It won’t be ready until the full moon.
You should have seen the one that got away
I TOLD YOU, 'If you don't take care of him...'
Hi, 'Hungry'. I'm Dad!
The good news is we won't have to fight over the drumstick.
It'll be ready when it's ready!
Look girls, it was us or Barney.
Yes I’m grateful that you killed it, but this has really hurt my standing at The Man Cave
I think I’m going to need one of you to invent the meat thermometer.
No, you're vegetarian. I'm paleo.
I marinated it overnight in twigs and dirt clumps.
Who wants a leg?
No, the earth has plenty of Woolly Mammoths
This is the last time we try to cook a paleo meal kit on a weeknight.  It's never 30 minutes or less!
I'm really more of an ideas caveman.
No caveman. Wingman.
Sorry, but pterodactyl’s not done until it reaches a safe temperature of 165°.
you can put the corn on now
I found it at a cave sale - the spatula came with it.
You sure you like it well-done?
Can you get me a Rolling Rock, this is going to take a while.
Believe me, it's organic.
Hey Marge, we could use some potato salad with this.
It's called cooking...who likes their meat rare"
If you all want well-done this might take a while.
Yep, Costco...
Is it 160 farenheit or centigrade?
I'm beginning to think we should have bought the smoker instead.
Don't think that I'm going to share this with you all.
Don't worry if we can't eat it all.  The mammoth ain't going anywhere anytime soon.
It's called the beyond drumstick...
The dark meat was all they had. I don't want to hear any complaints about it.
For well-done you have to wait another six hours.
They were giving these out at Extinction Park.
Let’s just say there’s an angry mammoth limping home tonight.
Tomorrow I'll invent a bigger BBQ.
I told you not to pick up the meat at Costco.
This Tyrannosaurus rex leg should last us all season.
Charcoal takes awhile.
You had to insist on "free range"
I told you, two days tops!
Yes, it is an improvement!
You said you wanted Keto for a month!
So glad we moved to Amarillo, honey.
The kids want to know if they can have the wish bone.
What do you mean “Did it have a Family “?
Trust me – it's worth the weight.
In unrelated news, we no longer have a pet mastodon.
The family is finally reunited, Fred was eaten by this beast a week ago.
Oh no, we are not letting that annual membership fee go to waste!
It will be ready in 3 weeks and four days; I suggest you get some sleep in the meantime.
Where is Thog with the Avocado Toast?
I know it’s wing night but pterodactyl legs were on special
Dinner’s gonna be awhile hon; evolution hasn’t gotten our dino down to chicken size yet!
It's called Bar-b-q.  It's the latest thing.
You know I hate to eat so late.  Next time let's get take-out.
Did you not even once think, when you were out there giving it all your macho schtick, that there's just the four of us for Thanksgiving ?
It did not fit in the sous vie pot.
At least the kids are learning the difference between "big" and "mammoth."
What? I wanted dark meat.
I got a leg up on that one!
I TOLD you I'd get you a leg up.
I'm preparing it medium rare extinct.
It's going to be awhile gang.
Hey do you want it done fast or done well done?
Diplocodus Marengo is not a dish that can be rushed.
Sorry honey, I already called the drumstick.
Just you wait. Someday every cave will have one of these fire cans and brag about the slow-cooked flavor..
If you want to reenact pre-historic tines again, then next time at least buy the largest grille on amazon!!!
By the time you go to Trader Joe’s and get the Cole slaw and potato salad, it’ll be ready
Honey, I grabbed the spatula instead of the tongs, can you get them?
Who likes drumsticks?
Did you make room in the fridge?
Don't worry.  It's on the Paleo diet.
No, I don't HAVE nuggets!
I liked your big brother too but people gotta eat.
Wait until you see the size of the salt and pepper shakers.
1. I know that you like to shop at Costco, but this is ridiculous.
2.  I told the kids that we sent Rex to ‘play’ at  your brothers farm to play. 
3. Be patient, only two more days till medium rare.
4.  You should have seen the thigh
There wasn’t any chicken, so I had to settle for this.
Just five more moons.
Now you tell me you wanted steak!
You said that you wanted it well done.
Hey, honey! Looks like I've finally got a leg up on this new BBQ thing.
you wanted wings???
Where’s my Ice Age cooler?
They were marked down at Giant Foods.
I finished the potato salad two days ago!
Oh yeah, forgot to tell you -- I can make fire.
It’s been four weeks; could we not at least have some breadsticks?
Yes, I am going to tell the story of how I killed it when your folks arrive. And again after that. And after that. Because I KILLED IT! Myself! Can't you people appreciate that?
For the last time, Sesame Street's in syndication.  Even if I did "take out Big Bird," you can still see him in living color.
Like I said, someday all the megafauna will be extinct and this thing will be the perfect size.
Say hey, good lookin' whatcha got cookin'?
NO, Sarah!  I’m not making you an Impossible Burger.
I've done my share. Did you make a ton of potato salad yet?
Somebody provoke the wrath of the gods or we'll never get this dinner cooked!
For next Father's Day, I'd recommend a larger spatula.
We’re eating like royalty tonight.
I'll need at least 3 more days to get the internal temperature up to 165 degrees.
Fred's coming over.
It will be done by the time Labor Day is invented.
Carcinogens don't scare me.
Don't you think you're going overboard with this Paleo diet already?
Archeologists are gonna have a field day with this one
Didn't I tell you we're having the family from two caves down over for dinner?
This is a rare delicacy.  In fact, the last of a species.
Our kids are eating us out of cave and dwelling. Are you sure this will be enough?
You said medium rare, right?
This would be a lot easier if I had tongs rather than a spatula.
The secret to a perfect medium-rare is only flipping it once.
It will be ready next march
It’ll catch on.
Set the rocks.
Look, it's not my fault global warming brought back the mega-fauna and now we live in a cave.
Honey get digging  we're running out of charcoal.
It’s still defrosting.
...Whatcha say we get started with some hot dogs?...
I've invented the slow cooker!
Honey, can you get the big platter out of the pantry? You know, the nice one?
Whoopee, you invented the B-B-Q! Now, how about inventing the B-B-Q dinner sometime BEFORE we become extinct!
I got dibs on the drumstick.
It's a good thing I discovered fire, isn't it Dear?
You'll have to forage for some ketchup.
Special at Costco.
Let's just say I know a guy, who knew a guy...
Honestly George, the fridge hasn’t been invented yet so we have no where to keep the leftovers.
I'll show them "renaissance faire."
Good thing I'm not a breast man.
You can never overcook chicken.
How many times do I have to tell you that it's not done until the internal temperature registers 180 degrees.
The legasaurus is almost ready.
Steroids!
I know you’re hungry, but if it’s undercooked we’ll all end up with salmonella poisoning.
I’m afraid there’s only dark meat
It was given hormones.
How was I to know it was the last pterodactyl on the planet!
Could you run out for more charcoal?
Tyrannosaurus Rex. It's what's for dinner.
It might have a tinge of meteor to it
Oh, quit giving me that "It's taking 65 million years" crap!
That reno we're planning -- the firepit's now Priority One.
Relax! You're the ones who ordered it well done!
Ready in two more moon phases, honey.
If you wanted the giblets you should have told me.
You should see the other dinosaur.
Kids, your dad is over-compensating again.
I guess just refrigerate the rest.
It’s from Popeye’s, not Chick-fil-a.
No, for the last time, its not Chick fil A OR Popeyes!
I’ve hear of “low ‘n slow”, but this is ridiculous!!
I invented fire!  And gluttony!
Sorry..I just invented the Weber. You'll have to wait 57 thousand years for the microwave.
We're eating Paleo tonight.
Yes Wilma, it's non-GMO!
Okay, so I asked them to Super Size it. So what?
They opened a Costco in the next mountain over.
You think it needs a few more minutes?
Sorry guys, the coals just took a little longer to heat up than I thought.
Supper is going to be late tonight.
If Flintstone brags about his bowling again, bring me a martini on the rocks.
You can start the potato salad now.
Sorry, cutting tools came after fire
Primo, I told you I prefer the breast!
Would you like dark meat or... dark meat?
Hey, if you all wanted 'wings" I'd have to take down FIVE tyrannosaurus!
I know I should have followed your advice and put it in the microwave first.
I hope evolution will give us something easier to cook.
It'll be another 20 umm, you know, anyway it'll be a little while longer.
Guess what’s cookin’ today guys! Dinnersaurus!!
Trok invent charcoal briquette. You need invent good china.
No, I'm not being a turkey. I simply asked how you wanted it done. Stone Age, Bronze age or Ice age.......
I know, I know, I should have gotten a Weber!
I know this is taking a long time but there’s nothing worse than raw pterodactyl.
Quite frankly I'm fed up with your vegan diet.
This happens every time you shop at Costco.
Dad always gets the big piece of chicken.
I told you we wanted Breast!
This part is well done, but the rest is pretty rare.
Would you like it raw, or do you want to eat next month?
You wanted a drumstick, I got you a drumstick!
Would you like yours medium, or medium rare?
Gonna be about 8 hours, hun.
Brontosaurus legs were on sale this week!
Rare to medium-rare. OK?
Who likes extremely rare?
The downside of buying in bulk.
Remember life before Trump? We could actually get meat that would fit on the grill!  Ahh the good old days.
Isn't today supposed to be Meatless Monday?
No wonder shipping was so expensive.
It was the only piece of dinosaur that I could find.
Open flames are so last millennium.
Hey, relax. Get a snack. It's just the shank of the evening.
When are we gonna eat dinner? Next week???
It's a Capitalist Cut.
I know it's taking a while, but we'll have leftovers until the Bronze Age.
It’s not like there’s some kind of device that tells me the internal temperature of the meat, Unaga. The kids will just have to wait until it’s charred and unrecognizable.
Oy vey.
If you want well-done, you'll have to wait.
what about us?
Be patient, this is my first fire.
Shouldn't you discover fire first?
Steroids, no doubt.
Oh no, not Thai food again!
You expect me to eat all of this by myself.
This is why the family-sized one was on sale.
Just be patient - I promise this will be much tastier than anything from Popeye’s or Chick-fil-A.
Will this be done before the Pleistocene Era?
I told you to get the brontosaurus bones.  Your friends are a bunch of gourmands.
Definitely Paleo.
We got it from Andrew Yang!
The Ice Age is coming, so we'll need to make it last.
Fang suggested we pair it with a fruity Chenin Blanc.
Yea, fire, shmire.
Dinner will be ready in 3 days.

A week from now you’re going to thank me for grilling low and slow.
What?  You don't like dark meat.
Does anyone have Brontosaurus allergies?
I wish we had enough for your parent's - next weekend dear!
Roll Tide. Roll Tide. For some reason that's all that comes to mind.
I'm crisping the skin.
It's all dark meat.
Maybe now you understand why I wanted a barrel smoker for Father's Day."
But were're vegans !
Just a few more minutes....
I TOLD you that we should get a bigger grill during the Labor Day sale, but nooooooo ....
Well done is going to take a wile, since you insisted to get the grill on Amazon!
Who's the one who's complaining about not liking dark meat?
Why is dinner taking so long? First I had to invent the spatula ...bitch!
You'll appreciate the Low & Slow method... sometime tomorrow.
So I see Goodyear bought out Tysons.
I already told you—the Mastadon was sold out.
I think it's still good.. it's only 60 million years old.
This time turn it over, brontosauris is disgusting rare.
Hang on. Dinner will be ready next week.
I think it needs a couple more hours until I turn it again.
Great. A high protein diet is sure to stink up the cave.
Look! Be patient! Someday this'll be veggieburgers.
Well too bad, I already called dibs on the drumstick.
And I thought I said a drum, sticks and smoke to make a long distance call......
This probably wouldn’t be taking so long if some-one would have bought me the Kill & GrillMaster BC 2000!
You won't be complaining when it's done.
Quit complaining, the white meat wasn’t on sale.
You wanted us to eat Paleo...
Once the moon goes down we’ll continue to time it on the sundial.
I have to turn it slowly.
Just my luck. Here comes my vegan mother-inlaw.
I hear it tastes like chicken.
No! There isn't any #%@# white meat!
Just tell them the dinosaur ran away...
OK, call the neighbors.  This’ll  be done in half an hour , then we’ll warm up the gravy while I carve.
Dear, the kids are asking me if this means you are going back on your promise to become a vegan.
Be patient. The Rex's front leg would have cooked faster but this part has the most meat.
If you cook the whole mastodon at once, the breast meat gets dry.
It's on now because the dark meat takes longer.
It should be ready by the Neolithic.
Um, it's been, like, 8 weeks.Can you go out and get something for us to eat while you finish cooking that thing?
I told you there was an upside to G.M.O.'s.
Well, why don't you go ahead and invent the rotisserie, then?
Might be a while . . .
You’ll be even more sorry you didn’t let me get the bigger grill of we get salmonella poisoning.
What--do you want it raw?
Honey, will this be enough for tonight?
Be patient, Sweetbeart. Krug says it makes the meat taste real good
I said, they were out of wings!
I found it at the dump.
The white meat is gonna take a little longer.
Relax, its a slow roaster.
We are going to need a bigger grill if you want to eat this by breakfast!
These mastodon shanks sure  take a long time to roast,
but they are worth it !
Get me the meat thermometer!
No!  It will not be done in an hour.
Some men have always risen to the challenge, no matter how big!
Don’t worry, hon, it’s completely sustainable.
Fear not... It tastes like chicken!
He makes grilling into such an ordeal
You can't hurry grilling mastodon.
Daddy knows what he's doing. Just have a little snack or something.
It will be a while before dinner is ready.
I'm thinking of calling it a "Barbeque".
Give me a break, I'm winging it out here!
I'm estimating because I broke my meat thermometer.
Whoever wanted white meat is going to have to wait until tomorrow.
I said gather more charcoal, but does the mighty hunter listen?
No, it didn't suffer "
Relax, it's actually vegan.
Honey believe me, this will be better than raw.
It'll be done in about six hours, you better order s pizza.
This may take awhile.  Get me a beer!
I’m sorry there is no white meat!
If I knew the weight I could have put this leg on the grill earlier.
Everyone ready for the Renaissance Faire?
The interior temperature has to reach 165 degrees.
Got the drum roll ready?  I'm bringin' it in.
Could you bring me a beer?
These damn dinosaur drumsticks take forever to cook.
If you think this is big, wait til you see the buffalo wings that the Smiths are bringing to our BBQ tonight!
Sorry, I struck out on the first two options. Popeye's was sold out and it's Sunday.
How would you like your mastodon?
(sigh)...more carbon emissions.  I guess no more Ice Age fun for you, kids!
Next time kill a smaller one!
If I had a bigger grill, this would have been done hours ago!
Oh, I got the grill from 'Amazon Future Fulfillment,' and could you believe this is the largest size they sell?  Like, what do they grill on these things? Sure glad we're not living in the future.
See if you can find my Bluetooth temperature probe
Is that a Weber Grille?
Sorry no white meat option today.
Whaddya want from me, I invented fire, not the 48” Weber.
You know, there are people freezing in the Arctics who would love to have that, so don't be so wasteful.
George, did you kill a dinosaur for our dinner? What are we, cavemen? We eat proper food.
No, we are not inviting anyone else for dinner"
It’s still frozen in the middle.
Yeah, I know I should have gotten a bigger BBQ!
''I don't know what it is, honey. Why don't you just cook mammoth with fire?''
Now you're smoking!
What do you mean we're out of BBQ sauce?
Stop whining—you can bet that its chicks are relishing uncle Bob.
The barbecue delivered from the future by Amazon's time machine is waaay too small.
Did too!
So how do you like it? Medium extinct?
Honey, you know bigger is better
It looks like we're going to need a bigger grill!
It's Homo luzonensis-licking good.
I know I know, don't you think I'd also rather have a big salad by now?
I don't know what a drum is but they said this is its stick.
If y'all are hungry too, there's another out back.
Can our Company evolve a little later?
I'm waiting for someone to invent barbecue sauce.
I got it at the Paleozoic fair.
Could one of you run out and get some more charcoal please?
Why does the man always have to do the outside cooking?
Ug no give any mammothflesh to Mim Mim or Cro if they no admit some magic lost when Tom Waits begin emphasizing percussion over piano.
new, mammoth sized grill...ha!
You know the drummies take the longest to cook!
Well done or medium?
Forget asking for well-done.
Drumstick go to hunter. You want eat, go gather.
We grill at 800 for 20,000 years.
Barbecue is the highest art form -- appealing to all the senses while nourishing the body. Watch an artist at work.
Is that big enough for you, Sharon?
...and I don't want to hear anymore nonsense about microwaves.
Honey, I found Godzilla!
I can't wait for someone to invent the pressure cooker.
Not barbecued Giant Teratorn  again!
Ready in three more days, so indulge yourselves with the appetizers.
What's more spectacular is that I just invented the barbecue grill.
Either the grills need to get bigger or the giant flying animals need to get smaller, cause this is getting ridiculous...!
I'm not sharing
The drum is not that big.
Be patient, this will taste way better than using the microwave.
Honey, you better go back to the store and buy 10 more bags of Charcol!
It's taste like chicken...whatever that is.
Would you look at that, there are three of us and he gets one drumstick for himself.
Couldn’t we just have settled for pizza?
I said no to the fries
Og took all the white meat again.
'The leg bone is connected to the. . .' you really don't want to know.
grumph hrtwaz flpwq.
Were  you readers expecting to understand his language?
Yes, it very well may be the Cenozoic before it's ready, but as long as I wear the one-shoulder-strapped animal skin, it's my way or the well-worn footpath!
"It'll be a while."
Just a few more days and it'll be done.  Hope you're hungry!
Yes, me need everyone. Spatula too small for flip. Want hot gallus prehistoricus or not?
It will be done in 3 days.
Thing is, with poultry, you don’t want to see any pink in the middle.
Don't look at me like that, I like midnight snacking.
I thought I would try an old family recipe
He's been like this ever since Curt laughed at him in the changing room.
Medium rare or well done?
Hold on! It's still not cooked.
Don’t worry, it tastes like pre-chicken."
We save more when we buy in bulk.
Almost done. Are the hors d'oeuvres and apéritifs ready?
No video games until we finish this.
You got that with a flyswatter?!?
I  think I need a bigger Webber Grill
sorry, but dinosaur was all I could find.
I think it's done, but bring me the meat thermometer to be sure.
We're set!  You should see all the rest I stored in the freezer.
Alright, yes you did tell me to buy the bigger Weber.
I asked for the leg because I'm tired of those sexist jokes.
Now you are telling me it could be hormone-treated?!
The travel agent said we would have an “authentic caveman experience”  with “vegan meat substitute”
The secret is stone-aging it 14 million years
So go back home to Brooklyn if you hate camping out!
Shall we invite the neighbors?
Someday, this will be popular in a place called Disneyland.
I hope it doesn’t have a mommy.
Paula Deen said, "until golden brown."
Guys, dinner's ready..wait, where's our pet birdie?
Huury they'll be extinct soon!
His name was Mac.
No dibs on the drumstick!
Thor's secret recipe called for a decidedly "low and slow" approach.
All good now, but wait until liver night.
No, it’s not hunter-gatherer. It’s hunter-grill master!
It’s all they had at the butcher shop!
I got some bad news. The children have converted to ‘veganism’
Well, is the potato salad done yet?
I have a "leg up" on the other cooks!
I don't what a beer is, but get it yourself.
This cooking unevenly.
I'm thinking of endorsing Andrew Yang.
If you cook the whole mastodon at once
No, there's not enough to invite your sisters.
I told him we only eat non-GMO
Don’t worry, it’s plant-based!
I promised the bone to the Flintstones.
Tell Og we appreciate his sending over some fire.
Listen, do you want it burnt or do you want it cooked?
So this thing fell out of the sky, so what?  So, what made you think we're supposed to burn meat on it?
That so stupid! We cook with carbon bits for many moons.  
Carbon not get stuck in the sky!
You get parasites if it's too rare.
In its favor it's free-range.
If course I checked the label for range fed and hormone free.
You should know the kids will only eat  white meat.
I told you, oven first, then barbecue!
You could channel the Food Network.
He sold me on the sizzle.
It's a T-Rex drumstick. You gotta problem with that ?
I'm on keto.
Don’t worry, it said “cooks all meat
in 20 days are your money back”.
Uber Eats! Uber Eats!  No!  It's home cooked tonight.
Make the salad.  We're almost there.
Peg, you're right, we shouldn't have messed with CRISPR, but the good news is everything taste like chicken.
No, our neighbors got all the white meat.
Sorry.  Daddy gets the big piece of chicken.
I know, but Shake 'n Bake wasn't going to work any better
What?! It said was for four.
Don't worry. Entirely free range. No growth hormones.
Sorry, the big ones take longer to cook
You said, how about roast pterodactylus!
What wrong with grill? If Og buy fire pit, Og know it never get used.
Someday, son, this will all be yours.
Maybe around full moon...
You better get started  on those biscuits.
I’m telling you, this is better than Popeye’s.
I hope you don't mind your mastodon leg rare.
I have a booth at the Renaissance Festival this year.
Who had the drumstick?
Don't worry. I saw this on a cooking show.
I've invited  the neighbors for dinner!
Let's just use the micro-cave oven and call it a day.
Just a midnight snack.
Is THIS why you invented fire?
...Another minute, just making sure it's well-done!
Next time I go with you when we shop for grills.
So much for our Palio diet.
Groog, grab the tree trunks to roast marshmallows.
Where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
Well I guess these kids won't be fighting over who gets the leg tonight.
We need a bigger kitchen.
Dinner's ready people!
This seems to be a bit too smokey. Maybe you should close the door.
I think I've finally breached the dichotomy of hunter/griller.
Mangia!
This may sound Paleolithic of me, but I still haven’t quite figured out how to chat-broil mastodon.
I only defrosted this for tonight.
Darling, how about we dine al fresco this evening?
Taking a while to thaw, was frozen for about 10,000 years.
Portion control doesn’t really matter with the Paleo diet.
Next time I’m gonna do take-out
When are you going to remember that we are vegan now!
Food done.
Yes dear, it is Free-Ranged but it’s not Organic.
we'll 

Remember it's Lent,  we all have to eat lightly."
Well, the breast definitely wouldn’t have fit.
It was all they had left
Yes, Grunthar, my boy. I know that brontosaurus don't actually have wings.
Look on the bright side. The sky fell on Henny Penny - not on us.
What else did you kill?
So Tyrannosaurus Teriyaki it is!
Mustard or ketchup?
Just like last year and thousands of Thanksgivings to come. 
I brought home the mastodon. I get the dark meat.
Take any longer with that and it won't be Paleo.
The grillmaster said low and slow.
Well, maybe just this once, I do want perfection to be the enemy of the good.
What!?  It’s a bonus gift from the bank.
This will make a lot of club sandwiches!
Didn't I tell you this would be more fun than our usual Pioneer Days re enactment?
This will be ready in about a week
They were out of flats.
Don’t worry, I don’t think he’s coming back.
Honey, get back in the cave. The Mother will be here any second.
It'll be ready by the time your Paleolithic relatives arrive.
The store was all out of white meat.
Once we get a car, we’ll be a modern stone-age family.
Teriyaki Pterodactyl coming right up!
I think I need a rotisserie.
Come on, give me a break here!  You can't expect Brontosaurus steak every night.
Dammit Jerry, with this again?
What do you mean, just put it in the microwave?
Since this will take a long time to cook, let me tell you about the benefits of barbecue smoking.
I call dibs on the leg.
Dave you are taking this whole Paleo diet too serious.
This is going to go great with cauliflower rice.
Well done.
We'll be feasting like kings tonight!
It's called meal planning.
Who wants the medium rare side?
Me think we call it “leftovers’.
The secret is a soupçon of spices on your pterodactyl wings.
I can't wait until Dinornis novaezelandiae is extinct
This may take awhile!
And now for my secret sauce.
I’m doing the best I can until someone invents a bigger grill!
Hope you like it 'extinct'.
Trust me, it'll taste like chicken.
Honey there's no such thing as a gas grill. We'll eat next winter.
I know I'm no Bobby Flay.
They call it the paleo diet.
Dinner’s almost ready, dear!
And I thought GMO’s didn’t exist yet...”
Well he SAID he'd make America great again!  You don't suppose that was just BS the the whole time, do you?
It will cook a lot sooner once I discover fire.
You said we should start buying in bulk.
I know it’s getting late, but we don’t want to risk getting an E. coli infection.
What were we thinking of doing this “theme” family vacation?
Dammit! I don't have room for the vegetables yet!
Hey,you do better!
Dad, didn't you say that we were going to Jurassic Fried Pterodactyl tonight?
The kids like it well done!
Honey, can you grab the rock salt and set a timer for 20?
Will it be finished before the end of the Paleolithic Era?
‘Tailgate?’  Has that even been invented, yet?
Might have to wait for next moon to do s'mores.
No. We don't have a vegan option.
We should go vegan!"
"Absolutely not.
Is it too late to mention I'm vegan?
Who asked for the turkey burger?
If y'all hate farts so much you can hunt your own mammoth.
He still wants Popeyes.
Your the one that wanted to shake and bake  
 Frank Buckley
Andover, MA
Now you can get started on a funny apron for me.
The chicken's ready!
you said you wanted the drum stick
Not so much a drumstick, as a barbecue statement.
Throg Dear, how much longer the children are hungry.
Well, the kids did insist on having it well done.
Hey man! Are you thinking to put a big thing in a small place again?
Leave Daddy alone, he's almost done
Who wants the dark meat?
Uh, I decided not to fast
Actually the Johnsons who are coming over only eat fish.
Hey, it’s from Popeye’s!
I hope you're not hungry, because well done will take a couple of days.
Your Mammoth is fine.  Three-legged like the grill, but fine.
You should see me flip flapjacks.
Go big or gamble with extinction
This George Form-ative Man grill really does the trick.
No,there's no vegan alternative.
It'll be ready by tomorrow"
I know it's taking a long time,
but I think I'm getting a  leg up
on the situation
Sorry to disappoint  you, but this is for tomorrow night's dinner. Tonite it's leftovers: brontasaurus meatloaf or sliced T-Rex over gathered greens.
No honey, I’m not going vegan with you
We'll have your favorite breast meat tomorrow, but this drumstick will make a nice bedtime snack.
I guess the old grill wasn't a dinosaur after all
Fine - next time I’ll use the pressure cooker.”
Dinner will be ready in 3 days.
The origin of the Popeye Chicken Sandwhich
This is mans’ work!
We’re gonna need a bigger fire.
The only thing that's endangered is your hunger, dear.
Did the Jones family in the next rock get the white meat AGAIN?
White or dark?
Did you have to go food shopping in a big box store?
I told you not to get Chinese food for lunch.
So, who wants some of this bird foot?
If only there were a way to cook this thing...!
This could take awhile. Better get some appetizers.
Did you have to shop at Costco?
I can't wait for the propane grill. He never got the feel for charcoal
This would go faster if  for Father's Day you had anted up for a Char-broil Tru-infrared 4-Burner Grill.
Man make fire. Woman not call Seamless yet.
Just prepping for the tailgate this weekend Dear...
It was a bad hunting season this year Webber, your mother and I are sorry about your pet.
Couldn't find any chicken, so I got T-Rex instead.
This drumstick is a challenge to barbeque evenly!
Who would like rare?
If Bam-Bam doesn’t come we will just have leftovers
It should be done somewhere between the golden age of Greece and the fall of Rome
Tomorrow, I have to cook the whole pterodactyl or it will spoil.
Don't you trust me?  I said I'd share this time.
Just don't ask your mother over for dinner.
Sorry,dinner is going to be a little late!
We discovered a magical place called Costco.
Are you sure this is how Bobby Flay got his start?
Yummy! Roast leg of pterodactyl.
The briquets are just starting to warm up
Stop complaining. At least it's not chicken again.
You said to make enough for you Mom.
Not yet....as I told you...’Low and Slow’
You can trust me to grill this to succulent perfection in only another fourteen hours.
Can someone give me a leg up?
Sorry kids, only dark meat tonight...
Hon, kids...the pterodactyl leg should be ready in um...four or five days. Let's go ahead and start with the salad nicoise, shall we?
Don’t know what you all’be eating...
It's Vegan--I promise.
See how lucky you kids are!
I already told you, Edith. The short ribs wouldn't have been any better.
Fine.  I’ll cook since you caught.
I’m calling it barbecue and  it takes longer than fresh off the thigh.
A watched pot never boils!
I think I call  it slow cooking.
Yes, your Dad provided again.
No, I don’t need his help on the grill.
Brad at the gym says Paleo is the big thing these days"
Pterodactyl wings, yay!
... but is it free range?
Sorry, I couldn’t carry the biscuits or the sides.
Dinosaurs are still extinct; right?
Be patient. The Foreman grill was not meant for mastadon legs.
You don't have to let that cook for another million years
Sorry, need wait.  Fire still new tech
You shoulda seen his teeth.
Is there anything vegetable based? We are vegan today.
Yes dear,
I did read the instructions.
Tyrannosaurus AGAIN?
Maybe we should invite the Jennings for dinner.
What kind of sauce do you want with your McLeg?
You know I don't eat dark meat!
You really have a leg up on the competition dear!
Surely this is enough Beyond Meat for opening day, right?
This slow-roasted  wooly mammoth is going to put us into extinction.
There's always KFC.
Hard to believe in the old days they used a fire pit.
We'll be eating at Fridayish this week.
Honey, I'm going to need a bigger spatula to flip this Bigfoot.
So, I take it gathering is going well.
Would Tyrannosaurus Rex be good for breakfast?
Tyrannosaurs Rex, left hind leg.
So, would you prefer rare, medium or well-done?
Not yet.  Internal temperture has to be 165 degrees for poultry.
Who wants mega-fauna?
Well, we wouldn't be eating so late if you hadn't waited until sunset to discover fire.
Hey Hon, got any marshmallows to go with this
Hey Google, how will I know that my brontosaurus legs are cooked?
From:  A History of  Philanthropy
It doesn't count unless you Instagram it, #OGpaleo
Whaddya mean the Grunks are vegan?
I hope you like your meat rare.
Maybe we went to far with Paleo.
When the heck are these dinosaurs going to evolve into a small chicken to fit my grill?"
I KNOW you prefer white meat, but those jackals called dibs again.
Put the kids inside Karen
Tonight's special: Last dinosaur with a touch of charcoal
GMOs? What GMOs?!
I'd rather set it and forget it.
Everyone for rare?
Who are you calling a "dumb stick?
We’re vegans now - just deal with it.
He wants white meat
'Honey, we need a bigger spoon'
Who wants to pull on the wish bone?
Cave life isn't cheap, I am doing some meal prep for the week
A Costco just opened.
You're gonna need a bigger spatula, Quint.
Pardon me if the concept of dining out isn't perfected on the very first try!
So it's late. Is it my fault they only had brontosaurus at the market?
I put the rest in the freezer.
Dinosaur.  It's what's for dinner.
The line was too big at Popeye's.
Got enough charcoal?
Stop complaining. Everyone is getting dark meat.
I think another 3 days should do it.
Ok, go get your dad's grille.  "dad's grille is bigger"  yeah yeah yeah
Well done takes a little longer
Excuse me for a living, but my new source of fire is a great leap forward for all of us. It just needs a little tinkering.
Dear God please let me cook this quickly or my wife and child  will have evil thoughts.
It's the hormones. I have to cook it in segments.
One anachronistic grilled dinosaur leg coming right up.
What do you mean you're all going to Popeye's??
It’s also all thigh and no breast.
Well it would've been ready an hour ago if you hadn't misplaced the tongs again.
We'll have plenty of roughage the the next 364 days....
Poker night I'm feelin’ lucky!
But you know I like white meat!
I can't wait for the invention of propane
No, we're all out of tenders.
I've trained the rest of him to help me hunt
The rest of him got away.
Who wants theirs next week?
I said he was big, I never said he was tender.
It may need a bit of hot sauce
One last side and breakfast will be ready
Until they invent KFC we're eating at home.
Right, but Thanksgiving's not for another month.
Yeah, I get that you’re all hungry, but I’m not feeding you undercooked poultry. If I had a six burner camp chef we would have been eating days ago!
For tyrannosaurus drumstick, Julia says it's four days on a side... I've never trusted French chefs; get me the meat thermometer, love.
But honey, you don’t understand! They were having a sale!
Your children are asking if dinner is a “beyond meat” product?
Kids, I know that you're really going to miss Dino, but as you can see, food is a bit scarce.
Rebecca Hawkins, M.D.
Yes Linda, it is free-range, certified humane.
Thought I’d get a Leg up on dinner tonight, since Winging it last night was a disaster!
I know it's sad.  We raised her and she was like a pet.  But we have to eat.
I'm not eating that; it looks like a GMO!
Next time get the small, single-serving legs.
Chicken , schmiken, give me Mamoth anytime!
Don't worry, in a few million years they'll evolve into right-sized chickens.
Mom, how much longer before we can have the meat on a sandwich again?
You should have seen the one who got away !
We'll be able to eat sooner once they invent the frialator.
" I want mine Pittsburgh Medium and Well Done for the kids.
You don't eat a Stegasuarus that's that smart all at once.
Turkey for the girls and turkey for the boys. My favorite kind of pants are corduroys.
Hey!  Have a snack!  This could take awhile.
Darn it Mrs. Weber:  I invented the grill.  Someone else will have to get the portions right.
It’s okay. Your mother is coming for dinner
Yeah, this leg is as big as a drum, and you should have seen the wings . . . . each was larger than a buffalo!
Some of this is going to be pretty rare.
Now with what should I garnish this
succulent repast
I wanted the deep fryer but nooooo, you said it’s too expensive and this one should cook just fine.
Life before the advent of The Food Channel
I think you’re really going to like this new spice rub.
No fighting over the drumstick kids!
Check out my latest invention: meal prepping.
Of course I’m smoking the wooly mammoth leg, am not a Neanderthal.
How many times do I have to tell you, it’s too big for the microwave!
This is the last Teratornis, so I'll be cooking it rare.
And I'm disappointed in you, too.
When I was a kid, we’d count ourselves lucky to get a wing.
Drumstick with me, kid, and you'll never go hungry.
Just searing the edges, honey. The meteor cooked the rest to perfection.
This is simply the downside of living off the grid.
Coming up - raw on top and burnt on the bottom.
Wasn't the rest of the tribe supposed to show up and bring the side dishes?
It's probably gonna be a while, I can't seem to get a fire started.
The chicken 's first, then you cook the egg and I don't want to hear any more about it see. We've got even bigger fish to fry
You were right, I should've sprung for the Deluxe Grill...
This one couldn't fly anyway.
I said I wanted white meat.
I'll be just one more minute.
Set the table and call the neighbors.
What do you mean you like it burnt?
I didn't hear a pterodactyl until the splash hit me. Its "p" was silent.
What! The hibachi’s broken.
If someone could invent mayonnaise the leftovers would make a nice chicken salad.
Be patient; It'll be done for supper, tomorrow
Fire pit not good enough for you. Oh no !You have to have Weber.
Lay off me, I'm on Keto!
Hon, when do you think I should flip it?
honey I don't think its breast fed
Pizza?
Who said size doesn't matter!
Have you seen the meat thermometer?
Screwing with me again, aren’t you?
So what if it’s free range and not pastured?
Ready the poop cannons.
We should've gone to a Paleo restaurant
Paleolithic! I said, Paleo... Look, just eat what I kill, okay?
It was free-range.
No it's not gluten free
Relax, it will be done in about a week.
Keto say dark meat bad.
It simply takes eons to cook these damn teratornis rexes!
Yeah, I know you're vegan. What- does this bother you?
Did fire come before the grill or did the grill come before fire?
Slow Food pioneer
Honey,  what did you expect chicken from KFC
tonight!
You won’t even know it’s vegan pterodactyl.
Just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant
No Shirley, I didnt get any white meat.
I didn’t think we’d need to worry about genetically engineered poultry for at least another 70-80 millennia.
Next time we’ll shake and bake.
And what will you be having for dinner?
Early proof that men earned their BBQ bragging rights.
Remember, you wanted a new washing machine instead.
I guess it escaped from the genetic research place when the electricity ran out.
We get it. You invented fire.

Be patient, this piece will take a little longer to cook.
Well, At least we are using metal straws!
Well, if you hadn't taken so long to invent fire we could've eaten by now

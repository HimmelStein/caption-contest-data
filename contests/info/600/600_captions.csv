If you want to know how to enslave the human race, you really should be talking to the cat.
No, don't take us to him. Just explain how he got elected.
He wants to ride with his head out the window on the way back.
We come from a galaxy one million light-years away ... well, seven million for you.
We should have been more specific when we ordered a new lab.
What do you mean he has to go out?
This time, my friend, the frisbee has caught you.
We'll just tell Dad that he followed us home.
I think it's a god, but I may have that backwards..
We must be really lost! His tag says "Pluto".
Please tell us where you buried the keys.
They feed him, bath him, and pick up his poop. He seems to be their leader.
When you rub the underside, the antenna goes haywire.
What do you mean you need to go out?
When we beam you back up the next time, we expect you to have the stick.
Before we land, let's send down the Rover.
We've achieved total control of the humans, but the cats remain a problem
They just eat, sleep and play and they have millions of slaves who do all the work.
They pick up his poo then tell him how great he is - of course he's the leader!
Maybe we need to be more specific than beam up the smartest creature in the White House.
Good luck, Zorg. Remember, you hate cats and mailmen.
See, I told you there was intelligent life on Earth.
We don't usually take in creatures from shithole planets, but you're such a good boy.
...and you say you've trained them to feed you, open doors for you and pick up your poop?
Strange place for an antenna.
Again? You just went out.
You beamed him up. You feed him.
His name is Scotty. What are the odds?
The scan shows it's full of someone's homework.
They took me to their leader. This guy seemed a bit sharper.
I think he needs to "go" where no dog has gone before.
I'd vote to keep this one. He's the only earthling we've picked up who's happy to see us.
We know about your leader. Take us somewhere else.
Tell Greg in Teleportation this wasn't the son of a bitch we asked for.
So this is the Mars Rover.
This is not the fat, yellow haired, one we aimed at but it is much smarter.
He's trying to sniff Uranus.
Greetings, earth creature! Are you the "Good Boy" of which all humans speak?
It's a god! Or did I get that backwards?
Can you believe he comes from that shithole planet?
Contact base station and tell them the beagle has landed.
I accidentally jingled the keys and he jumped right in after me!
We found it tethered to an inferior lifeform.
We understand you have our homework.
He does that whenever I mention the name of our planet, Whosagoodboy.
He loves it when we crank it up to Warp Five and then open the window for him.
Results are still preliminary, but all indications suggest he is a good boy.
I think you got it backwards. I'm d-o-g.
He says he wants to stick his head out the window.
Dude, they'll find me. I have a chip!
Unconditional love. Friendly. Loyal. Seriously, it is Earth's most advanced life-form.
Sometimes you catch the saucer, sometimes the saucer catches you.
He was the only earthling who heard our whistle.
I asked if you had to go before we left Andromeda.
When they meet, it appears they check each other for anal probes.
He wants us to beam up the hydrant.
His I.Q. measures superior to their President...
Prepare to launch the Rover.
Looks like there might be intelligent life here after all.
Ambasador, your job will be to become their best friend.
Trust me, you don't want to meet our leader.
The way they follow you around and pick up your poop--we just assumed you were the leader.
I think we've found the wrong Pluto.
I know that's our normal rule. But he's a therapy dog.
He says we'll be welcomed with open arms as long as we're not from some s-hole planet.
They pick up your WHAT?
He appears to be smarter than their President.
We just met but I already feel like he’s my best friend.
He's saying that cats are evil and we should destroy them all.
Our search for unconditional love is over.
Seriously, it's the only intelligent life we found.
That's not Elvis, you dummies. It ain't nothin' but a hound dog.
Its rear tentacle does that whenever I say "space walk."
He's saying that Cats are an invasive species on Earth.
I think his name is Sit.
Again? We just beamed you up five minutes ago!
Who forgets to put a planet on their dog tag?
Take us to anyone but your leader.
I view it as more of a rescue than an abduction.
No, Im sure of it, I saw them picking up his poop, so he has to be their leader
I specifically asked for a new Laboratory Receiver.
If you decide to invade, I recommend getting the squirrels first.
A yellow lab!?!? I clearly said beam me up a Scotty!
What do mean you have to go out?
What's that? Timmy's fallen into a gravitational singularity?
A boy, sir. And apparently a good one.
Is that in lightyears or dog years?
Captain, can we keep him?! Please?
Who's a good abductee? You are! Yes, you are!
What’s that, boy? Timmy fell into a black hole?
It appears there is intelligent life on their planet after all.
We wanted to ask you a few questions about your best friend.
We'd like to know how you enslaved all the humans.
We understand dogs now, but please explain cats.
Perhaps we can get it to produce some of those little brown things humans seem to prize so much.
The flying disc gets them every time!
He's been afraid to go out ever since he learned space is a vacuum.
Our first sign of intelligent life!
So, you're saying that our plan to take over the Earth has failed because "they fed you tasty treats and rubbed your belly"?
“Who’s a good alien life form? Who’s a good alien life form? You are! Yes, you are!!
We shall name this planet K-9.
Make Dave roll over again before we change him back.
That's the last time I ask Alexa to bring up the subwooffer
Believe me, you don’t want our leader.
Of course I can speak. You're just the first one's to really seem interested.
Proceed with caution, these creatures have already enslaved humanity.
What do you mean he wants to go outside?
He says he wants to go where no dog has ever gone before.
I'd like to defect.
He must be in charge because that other life form was picking up his poop.
We’ve come 65,000 light years to answer the riddle of the universe. Now tell us, who’s a good good boy?
This wasn't the Rover we had in mind.
He'd like to know if we've seen his stick.
Noooo...I said beam me up a Scottie.
When we contacted you on the internet, no one knew you were a dog
All I've found out is the back part moves if you ask "Who's a good boy?"
I could be mistaken.....but I believe he is asking permission to smell our butts...
After we drop you off, your job is to convince them you’re their best friend.
It's the most intelligent life we could find down there.
You can't be Sirius.
He has to be the one in charge...the other one was following behind and picking up his droppings
I'm sorry but we haven't seen your ball.
Bring us one of their newspapers.
Mission accomplished. We will report that this planet's inhabitants are friendly and playful.
This is the biggest frisbee I ever chased .
I thought you asked me to beam up a Scotty.
We, of the planet Dyslexia, welcome you, O God, to our humble spaceship.
All this time... we thought they would look like us.
This one MUST be the leader - the other creature was seen picking up its poop!
It seems to be a household god requiring frequent stroking, special food, and being spoken to in gibberish in a high pitched voice.
The good news, Captain, is you're back on board. And while the transporter is still malfunctioning...who's a good boy? You are! Yes, you are!
As far as we can tell, this species has the ability to get people to do whatever it wants.
What strange power it must have. I’m getting a warm and fuzzy feeling.
We overheard an Earthling say he was the best dog in the world.
Remember: Infiltrate, Observe, and Report. And don't drag you butt across the carpet.
What's that girl, Timmy fell in a black hole?
Can we keep him, Dad?? Huh, Huh? Please, can we keep him???
And they have trained hairless apes to pick up their excrement.
Trump? No, seriously, take us to your leader.
Yes... but how did you train them to pick up the poop?
The conquest should be pretty easy, we just to have to say "'sit and stay."
Now remember, you only know, "Woof!"
He seemed to be the one in charge.
He has a family of slaves who prepare his meals and pick up his waste.
Can I keep it? It followed me back to the ship.
This one is smarter than the orange-headed one we had last week.
Yes Sir, we got the leader. The other one was only picking his poop
We must know: how do you get the other one to follow you on the rope and carry your poop?
How do you convince them to bag it for you?
This creature appears to be far more intelligent than the strange orange one they call their leader.
Based on Twitter, this creature appears too intelligent to be human.
Noooo, not THERE. On the astroturf...
The scan shows an exceptionally kind, intelligent race. It’s safe to disembark.
See, I TOLD you there was intelligent life on that planet.
Well this is the funny part. It will feel like seven years to you....
I believe his antenna is searching for a signal.
You see ... there is intelligent life down there after all!
Tell us everything you know about the Rover mission to Mars.
Its an Earthling called "K-9" but is very fond of Uranus.
We are pleased with your progress towards complete mind control over humans.
And you two doubted the existence of Dog
We think it's a human without all the drama.
I swear, he followed me home
They're more evolved than we were led to believe.
This is the one they call Dog, creator of the universe.
Who was that pathetic creature you were pulling on a leash?
No, I said "Beam me up a Scotty".
I swear he understands what I'm saying.
Believe it or not, we're here to sniff your butt.
We’ll tell them he followed us home.
Who's Timmy, and why would he be down the well?
He's asking if we beamed up squirrels too.
Yes, he was leading the other earthling.
You'll remember nothing, but you'll feel compelled to chase frisbees and flashlight beams.
If we claim he's a service dog we can keep on board till we are home
This'll be a babe magnet on Glorth.
Besides being man's best friend, they say his greatest assets are his mental stability and being like, really smart.
Well, his tag does say "Captain". What the heck, let's go with it.
What's that, girl? Timmy's fallen into a black hole?
After listening to President Trump, we assume you represent the intelligent life on Planet Earth.
Awesome disguise Henry, they will have no idea we are watching.
Our advanced technology allows us to communicate with you telepathically and... no, you can’t stick your head out the window.
We will reach Vega in 25 light years, but you should multiply that by 7.
That remarkable posterior appendage seems to oscillate whenever it hears this series of phonemes: ‘hoo-zah-guh-boy.’
Who wants to go for a ride?!!
Why does the beast assume this position every time I call your name, Sit?
I know we have to send him back, but I feel like I'm losing my best friend.
'Can you send me back in time so I can get my testicles back?'
Bacon! ... See, it's universal.
We used to infiltrate earth disguised as humans but canines are treated with more respect.
So you say you've been sent with a message from Pluto..
Is this the one that ate your homework?
finally . . . an earthling to study from that shit hole planet
Earthlings are smarter than we thought.
He’s a rescue.
Noooo...I said beam me up a Scottie.
At long last! Intelligent life!!
'He says there's no intelligent life down there.'
WHO IS AN EXEMPLARY CANINE SPECIMEN? YOU ARE. YES, YOU ARE.
Copy that, Commander Rex. Vaporize all cats on earth.
And, Bob, try not to laugh this time when they pick up your excrement.
Scotty?
Sir, we come to you from Canis Major.
What does it mean 'Timmy is stuck in the well.'?
So we agree, he’s not the dominant species, but he thinks he is.
Can I keep him? He followed me home.
Excellent! Let’s send the human back.
He misses Pluto.
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to befriend the humans and gather intelligence.
HAVE. YOU. SEEN. OUR. BALL?
It produces a valuable substance that is reverentially gathered by devoted servants...
I don't know what it is but I want it.
Stephanie's been told you've gone to a farm way, way upstate.
Who let the dog in, who who?
I'm not sure why they asked us to bring back a lab specimen
Do you know Lassie? We want to meet Lassie.
He's asking us to roll down a window.
I hope you abducted some plastic bags, too.
Wait. Didn’t he JUST go out?
This was the only intelligent species we could find.
I said, "retrieve her," not "retriever!"
He says he will answer all our questions but first he wants his tummy rubbed.
He's gonna want to stick his head out the window...
I don't think he realizes it'll be 3,000 light years before we can walk him!
So, what's your secret? How do you control them?
He says he's a good boy. I think we should believe him.
We have either captured their God, or my dyslexia is kicking in
Speak.
No, I said capture the MARS Rover
Your mission is to become man's best friend.
Could you help us find Pluto?
Who knew that Earthlings could be so loving and faithful?
OK, forget about your leader – take us to Oprah.
He must be their leader. Everyone was feeding him, massaging his belly, and they even cleaned up his waste matter!
I think we finally found their leader!
I certainly hope we're landing someplace with a tree.
I’m not taking him out again.
This species is much smarter than the orange haired one we beamed up from the big white house..
What did you do with our shoes!?
Can we keep him daddy?
I am pretty sure I said, "beam me up a Scotty." This looks like a labrador.
These Earthlings appear to be more intelligent than we were led to believe.
Fido to ground control. No signs of open hostility, but without the presence of tails I cannot- repeat cannot- confirm intentions at this time.
He must be a king. Humans pick up his poop.
I think she’s figured out the meaning of s-p-a-c-e-w-a-l-k.
We're traveling at twice the speed of light and you want to go out for a walk?
It appears there is intelligent life on earth after all
Excellent report Agent Fido.
I was wrong, Oxnar. Apparently there IS intelligent life on the planet.
Quite an evolution since our last visit - two more legs, and less murderous.
Very odd--a head, four legs and a handle.
I don't understand this one's language either, but I like him better than the two-legged one.
Our long search is over. We've found the Good Boy.
I'm beginning to think Earth is worth saving.
Remember complete the mission and ignore the sticks
Who's a good earthling? You are! Yes, you are!
I think he wants to go out again.
We overestimated their intelligence, but way underestimated their friendliness.
Spock, not Spot!
Please don't send me back.
The other one was less advanced, only two legs and no tail.
We went to the White House, and this was the most intelligent being we found.
I thought that you wanted to be beamed up. Now you want to beam down again?
He helps with my feelings of alienation.
You're sure he can hold it in for 20 light years?
Who's a good earthling? You! You're a good earthling!
Captain, we've found intelligent life on Earth.
It is attempting to communicate through that oscillating appendage
It's just an expression; the country's not gone to us yet.
This is Earth's highest species. They are so revered that the humans walk behind them to clean their mess!
We were sent to find a stable genius.
We desire your secrets to domesticating humans.
Still can't scientifically conclude whether the dog is wagging the tail or the tail is wagging the dog.
Our selection criterion was emotional intelligence.
Despite the awful breath & limited vocabulary, I feel the need to be best friends.
Who let the dog in? Who?
What's that, Timmy's fallen in a worm hole?
Of course he's a leader...the 2-legged ones pick up his poop every day.
And you really get them to pick up your poop???
Take us to your breedeer.
The most intelligent life form we found at the White House, Your Highness.
It seems happy to see us.... and that's a first.
And to conclude the peace treaty between your planet and ours let us now sniff YOUR crotch.
Well, that's not Dave.
It was the only species on the entire planet emanating any sense of joy.
You sure we took the Rover that explores planets?
I don't understand how earthlings got that reputation for being greedy and evil. This one seems nice to me.
Humans are different. If we abduct him, there will be signs on every utility pole on the planet.
In space we can still hear you barking all night.
"Confirmed. There is no intelligent life on earth. The table scraps, however, are to die for.
Well, at least he's more intelligent than their leader
We found him 30 million dog-years from home.
Do we divide or multiply the number of light years by seven?
I said “Beam me up Scotty!” not “Beam me up a Scottie!”
Quickly captain... We need to find a planet with grass...
Who's a good terrestrial organism? You are!
He’s says he’s relieved to finally have a substantive conversation.
He has to go out again.
Only this one survived. Our curiosity seems to have killed the other specimen.
Is he ship broken?
The rumors are all wrong, Earthlings are actually adorable.
She'll be helpful I promise, there's a lot of unmarked territory out there.
He wants to know if there are treats where we come from..
Outside?
Who's a good lifeform?
We would have made contact with humans first but what we really value is loyalty.
How old is he in light-years?
That's really interesting, we eat our own poop too.
The Earthlings worship this creature , including picking up its droppings with special bags.
Can we keep him? Mom ? Dad?
No Zykon. I said get me proof of GOD.
Captain, if my calculations are correct, we have just proved the existence of dog.
With this disguise you can infiltrate the earthling's sleeping quarters.
We selected the smartest living being from their White House
Contrary to belief, there is intelligent life on the planet .
In space nobody knows you’re a dog
What is it boy? Jimmy’s stuck in another dimension?
They kept asking, "Who's a good boy", but I didn't know what to tell them.
What took you so long ? These humans are idiots.
Wrong one. The leader of each house says 'meow'.
Looks like humans have advanced since last time we visited.
Ahhhh, not the space rover I had in mind.
I do believe this species will be quite useful in our War with the Squirrel Planet...!
Pretend you are their best friend. Then, in a few thousand years we'll implement the second part of the plan.
Whatever it is, I can't help but like it.
And remember, just sniffing and licking, no probing.
Tell us more about the slaves who pick up your feces.
So, you are the one they call "King".
Earthlings are both friendlier and smarter than our planet scans indicated.
We were searching for God, Zandar; you got it backwards!
I think he has to go out.
He must be an intelligent creature. He got that necklace on even without hands.
The cat never mentioned this 'best friend' you speak of.
Why does it like my leg so much?
Yes, I play bridge.
You beamed the wrong Scotty.
Maybe we won't destroy Earth
He wants our help catching squirrels.
Yes, the two legged ones are our pets.
It’s more intelligent than their broadcasts led us to believe.
We've never heard of cats. Why do you ask?
I don’t think he understands the gravity of this situation
OK, which one of you is going to take me outside?
He’s a rescue.
He was scratching at the pod bay door, Hal.
You’re gonna have to hold it, buddy.
It was terrible.They don't even have indoor plumbing. Now, help me get out of this costume.
Why times 7?
At first, they took us to their leader, but we like this little fellow much better.
Predictions for life on earth did not prepare me for this level of cuteness.
Well he looked like their leader. He even had a slave picking up after him.
So, you're why people don't completely hate Earth.
...And as the highest species on our planet, we are the masters of our household and the humans cater to our every whim.
Greetings bitch.
A word of caution, its brown eyes can achieve mind control over humans.
You say your leader is a moron?
I'm keeping him.
Is it possible we abducted the wrong end of the leash?
He is definitely the prime life form as he was leading these poor animals on some kind of leash.
The humans seem to give him whatever he demands
No, they are not the dominant species on that planet, but based on our extensive observations, these are the most admired.
They look like a friendly people. We'll be fine.
Perhaps his is a cautionary tail.
Is he from a shit-hole planet?
We've observed your interest in bones. Are you what earthlings call an "archaeologist"?
Tell us everything you know about your best friend.
He wants to know if he is a good boy.
Finally, after all the other test subjects, we have evidence of intelligent life on this planet!
We have no bones.
He may be looking at me but it isn't my turn to take him out.
Get the P-R-O-B-E.
... Technically, it's a rescue.
We've been outsmarted by a cat.
I knew I shouldn't have chased that Frisbee...
He says we’ve got the wrong guy. It’s his best friend we want.
His subjects feed him, bathe him and clean up his excrement.
Sure, I'll tell you everything for a treat!
This new version of the Mars Rover responds better to voice commands.
The thing on his neck says Pluto, small world :)
I've seen this creature before. It thrusts its snout into curious places.
What’s that, girl? A shuttle craft full of school children is trapped in an asteroid belt? Quick, show us the way!
Sorry, we're sending you back. On the internet, we didn't know you were a dog.
We have the most sophisticated translation software in the universe and we still can’t figure out what “arf” means.
I'm pretty sure this is the wrong Rover
And here's the best part. They pick it up off the ground and throw it away for me!
Captain, something has gone horribly wrong in Steve's teleportation.
Timmy fell down a black hole?
You asked for a fetching specimen.
Humans? Somewhere between cats and squirrels, I'd say.
"Yes it was a long assignment and yes, they are as stupid as they look".
Take us to your tweeter.
It's easy. Just run after any stick they throw, and if one of the baby ones is around, lick its face.
I said "Mars" Rover.
I wanted a Mars rover, not a Rover for Mars!
I took him out last time..
Well, let me guess this time. Did the humans eat your research data again?
Houston, we have an adorable problem.
Finally, we got a smart one.
Take us to your stable genius.
But you were JUST out.
Who wants to go for a spacewalk?
First I'll earn their trust
Do you want to go for a ride?
Actually, we wanted the one on the other end of the leash.
All these humans understand is “sit”.
Teach us how you programmed them to follow you around and gather your waste.
Great idea ! If we send Gork to Earth for a few days it'll save us doing all the anal probes.
Who's a good victim of abduction? Who is?
Okay Siri... Where's the nearest fire hydrant?
It looks like it worked! Everything came through except the fleas.
Then he feeds me twice a day, walks with me, and I'm not sure why but he collects my poop. It must be valueable.
Who farted?
They open and close doors and feed him on his command, and gather for safe keeping his waste matter. Of course he's their leader!
I might have told him we were going to Canis Major.
Earthlings appear to communicate with their rear ends!
How did you convince them they were in charge?
Now that is far fetched
What's that? Your planet needs help?
Who's a good, earth-based lifeform?
I think we should name him Scottie.
We found him wandering on the moon. His name is Lunar Rover.
My sensors indicate that he’s a good boy.
Well, the natives seem friendly.
The human is far more advanced than we had predicted.
If he's not spaceship trained, someone's going to be in deep doo doo.
Take me to your alpha!
I thought you said there was no intelligent life on earth
It says it wants to be our best friend.
"mans best friend" just relieved itself on our transporter.
We must know. How do you condense time in a seven to one ratio?
Finally! A species eager to please.
I like this human way more than the others we've abducted.
Who's got the formula to covert light years into dog years
In outer space, nobody knows you're a dog.
Tell us how you domesticated humans?
Just keep wagging that and they won't suspect a thing.
The thought I'm reading is: you smell funny but do you have treats?
No, there are no fire hydrants in here. Why do you ask?
Says it lives in a 'dog-eat-dog' world!
You are to be deported back to Canis Major.
Just one question: how did you get them to pick up your poop?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ambassador.
Now beam me up a Scottie
Okay boy, you know the drill. Teleport back when you’ve finished pooping.
We hadn't expected intelligent life.
If you lived with us, you'd never have to take a bath.
Of course you’re his overlord. He follows you around and collects your feces in plastic bags!
He says he's a genious on his planet.
He looks odd. But for some strange reason, I feel a strong emotional bond.
Should be a quick war. He says the bipeds will take shit from anyone.
He's been their friend for thousands of years, and they treat him like a dog.
Don't worry Harold. You're going as man's best friend.
It was either this one or a clearly inferior species that collects its excrement.
Not the Humane Society you dummy, you were supposed to bring us a sample from the human society!
So this is what a "good boy" is.
He must be the leader. The guy behind him was picking up his crap.
Let’s first recall what we learned from the rattlesnake.
We brought back the most intelligent earth life from, we left his humanoid pet behind.
DOG?GOD? Must reference semordnilap dictionary....
That's a Lab. I asked for a Scotty.
...I am the Leader
He's definitely in charge. Have you see what the bags are for when he walks?
Scanners say that this specimen's a very good boy
We assumed the two legged beings were the most advanced, but then we came across this.
Finally, a reason not to destroy Earth.
You are the cutest creature in the entire universe.
They cut them off AND make you chase them?
Just say you're from Norway.
These humans are more affable than we have heard.
Let's skip talking to their leader. It's easier to communicate with this guy.
They warm this up and put it in a bun?
This was the only worthwhile souvenir.
Tell Schrodinger we want a cat.
"He likes us! I think he really likes us!
You said we needed more diversity, sir.
Who's a good earthling?! Who's a good earthling?!
Hmmm...he appears to be much more intelligent than the two legged ones we've captured previously.
OKAY, do you have to go out?!
Whoa !! the captain's changed, but at least he's in a good mood.
I guess this is a case of the dog catching the giant frisbee and not knowing what to do with it.
You can keep him, but I am not taking him for a space walk.
They have trained humans to follow them and to pick up their waste. The humans so prize the waste that they put it in little bags and carry it with them to various offering sites.
Show us how you lick your own privates.
I'm not sure what he is, but I do know he's a good boy.
Yes! I am the most intelligent species on the planet Earth.
Definitely a superior life form!
So, the reigning class on Earth is four-legged and furry and has its two-legged servants in a tight grip.
See. Every planet has at least one worthwhile species.
Well if this is the leader and the creature behind was carrying his excrement, there's no sense in trying to make contact with them.
This species is so advanced that it poops wherever it wants and gets another species to pick it up and hide it from sight.
You guys saw I typed the letters G.O.D in our tracking system didn't you?
It already seems like my best friend.
Take me to your alpha!
Do you know who chewed up the transporter controller?
He sounds more intelligent than the one we picked up last time with two legs.
No, I'm a dog. We keep humans as pets.
On the Internet, we couldn't tell he was a dog.
Wag your tail if you're happy to be rescued from Trump's America.
If you're asking for a ransom, can you request a few biscuits?
Usually they aren't this happy to see us!
We've got a Woofer. Now all we need is a Tweeter!
He seems pleased about returning with us to the planet frisbee!
Greetings agent Rover. Our plan is nearly complete. When Trump is re-elected in 2020 we predict you will be the dominant species by 2030.
Don't tell me you forgot the tennis ball again.
Finally, we will see what precious substance Earthlings are so eager to pick up.
OK, now let's capture the second-most intelligent life-form on Earth.
Clearly, we have beamed up a being from a far superior planet!
We greet each other the same way!
What's with the nose?
Unlike the leader of the free world, when he lifts his leg he doesn’t say a word.
It's so much more evolved than those humans.
It barks in Klingon, but it understands Kubrick.
Pretend you are their best friend, but don't eat off the table.
I said 'Beam me up a Scottie,' not a mutt.
How did you train humans to collect your excrement?
He's much better looking than the average Earthling...smarter too!
Greetings bitch.
"What do you mean Pluto isn't a Planet?
So, who’s your best friend now?
The one thing worth saving.
I can't beam me up, and my name is NOT Scotty!
It followed me home. Can I keep him?
So let me get this straight--your Leader also has orange fur on his head and growls quite a lot, but he's much dumber than you?
We have finally discovered intelligent life on planet Earth!
You asked for their most advanced species.
I've a feeling I'm not in Kansas anymore.
You were selected on the basis of loyalty.
It's a deal: a lifetime supply of chew toys in return for everything on your planet.
Most Cherished Species, please, tell us your secret.
Fascinating that they could build a spacecraft only being able to say “woof’
Apparently, most earthlings prefer them to humans.
This is clearly the highest life form on the planet. Each one has a human following it and picking up its feces.
It was their most advanced lifeform.
It was either him or the clown with the orange hair.
How do you get them to feed you and pick up your poop?
He said, 'Find Dog Star." " You can't be serious.
Let's name him after a star.
It’s saying it wants to go out.
Yes, but can you be an extraterrestrials best friend?
Sir, you requested a lab report from Earth.
Which end do we speak to?
2018 Mars Rover marks new territory
Well, he's a lot smarter than that two-legged one we got last time.
From what we can tell, he's a good dog. A very good dog.
The movement of the rear appendage appears to be a navigational device.
Now, according to their "YouTube" he starts playing piano.
We're in space, lets name him Rover!
Sorry, I'm more of a cat alien.
This is historic. We're finally laying our eyes on a real live human.
It will make earthlings much less anxious to see us.
He's asking if we all came from the same litter.
Who's ready for a space walk?
We're encountering something we didn't allow for - he wants to go out.
He asked if we could beam him back down on January 20, 2021.
I don't want to be their best friend anymore
Major Tom, call Ground Animal Control.
Someone saw our poster!
Don't worry, it's saucer trained.
They said they'd send us something way better than their leader
Who's a good blyrzch? You are! You're a good blyrzch!
Can we keep her?
Send him to one of those shithole countries.
...and then he said Haiti was a "shithole" country so I figured I'd live with you guys for a while.
You can have your ball back after you answer a few simple questions.
Do all dogs on Earth have servants to pick up their poop?
You know you can't walk him out there, so I got him this big weewee pad.
Why the long face?
When is a dog's tail not a tail? When it's a waggin'.
I'm picking up that the greeting etiquette for Earthlings involves something called a 'butt- sniff'
Waste of time. Planet has fleas.
It must be an Unidentified Fetching Object
Take me to your follower.
Who knows why but they seem to worship it.
I would run away if I were you too.
He wants to know if we're Norwegian.
Can we keep him? It's friendly and has superior intelligence over the 2-legged version of Earthlings.
No, you can’t go for a walk.
When I said abduct the dog, I meant President Trump...
We thought you would understand Russian.
Our Lifeform detectors received signs of a Good Boy.
First let's find out why they have so many 2-legged pets.
Be careful. They have a power that enslaved Earth humanoids.
I find it hard to believe he just followed you home.
What is boy? A fire down by the old Jetson's house?"
Did you remember to take him out before we left?
We do not want to meet your leader.
The tail is speaking binary code, 010 001 100 110 101, for hello.
Leader? That would be me.
Sir, we believe this animal to be the most important life on Earth since humans willfully pick up their poop.
Who knows, he could be our new best friend.
Apparently this life form communicates by thumping its tail.
Take us to your alpha-male.
Sorry, I can't stay.
Can you teach us how to train earthlings to follow us around and pick up our doo?
He's smarter than their leader.
A lab?! I clearly said, “Beam me up a Scottie.”
We must be in the constellation of Canis Major
Under "Target of Exploration," I put "God," but I forgot about autocorrect.
You have done well subjugating the Earth, but can you update us on the cat problem?
What do you mean you don't have to pick it up in a bag, it just floats away?
We have observed humans picking up your excrement. Your race is clearly the leader of man.
Your mission is to find out who's a good boy.
Well, he certainly appeared to be the smarter one
This one seemed to enjoy the probe.
Ok, ok, he didn't follow me home. Can I still keep him?
He agrees to a rectal probe, but only if we use our noses.
Would you consider being our best friend?
My research on tail movements suggests he has to “go,” but I haven’t been able to determine what that means...
He was friendly and by far and away he was the most intelligent life we could find.
Daily walks might be a problem.
"We don't understand the word 'biscuit'".
Take me to someone smarter and more stable than your leader.
It won't do it unless we let it go outside.
we brought back the most intelligent being we could find
Our instruments clearly don't work in this atmosphere. On the Intelligence Meter, this creature scored 22% higher than the Earthling Leader.
Tap...tap, tap. What does the code book say?
These earthlings are more intelligent than I thought they’d be.
Thank goodness there's at least SOME intelligent life down there.
I just said "come" and he came.
He looks too intelligent to account for what's going on down there.
Based on what we've seen of the leader your humans elected, we think it best to converse with you instead.
We'll call him Pluto.
He says he has business to do on earth.
Take us to your Lunar, Rover
Of course this one's in charge. The one with two legs was picking up his poop.
I thought you were a cat person.
Yea, taking the dog is a way better idea!
It's a gift from the Russians
We're thinking of rigging the next Presidential election. Would you be interested?
I said beam up Scotty, not Spotty!
Let's see if he'll fetch in zero gravity.
Definitely the intelligent life here, too bad his pets are ruining the planet.
Now remember your mission: go infiltrate a human family and report back.
Did you bring your vaccination records with you?
That’s right. Dog-light years are seven times longer, too.
It worked! Now let's see wheter we can turn George into a rabbit.
These earth creatures are the most lovable and loyal species we've found in the universe.
It followed me home. Can I keep him?
They seem to have more leadership qualities than the other species.
It took us 3 light years to get here, or 21 in dog years.
Those beings I see you leading around must be an inferior species?
This four-legged one seems to be the more intelligent of the species.
So you are saying if we offer belly rubs and squeaky toys we could take over the world?
can we keep him this time?
We've been monitoring Twitter so there'll be no, "Take me to your leader."
We’ve been studying this planet for generations and have determined that he is a good boy.
It’s their leader.
Explain how your species has enslaved the humans, and we shall provide a treat.
Finally, our journey of finding a good boy is over.
He says he has a wide-ranging interest in medieval and renaissance literature, but all he gets on earth is "go fetch."
That's not a Scotty you beamed up, is it?
What’s that, Sport? Timmy’s fallen down a black hole?!
Back to your shithole planet, dog.
The four legs, long ears, sensitive nose and temperament are all improvements over the last Earthling we examined.
We’ve discovered that this Earth creature is their most intelligent.
Then I get my dinner around 5 PM, relatively speaking.
It seems his name is ‘sit.’
Bear with me, I'm Sirius I have to get to the Dog Star to bury my bone.
Our research indicates that this is the highest life form on the planet.
Daddy, can we eat... I mean keep him?
And is your leader also, like, really smart?
Well, sure you can come live on our planet. We value kind, decent, honest life. Doesn’t everyone?
I don't know either. I just heard this guy saying "Beam me up a Scotty," and then this great whooshing sound, and now here I am.
They seem friendly enough, but I was expecting opposable thumbs.
And who is going to walk him?
In outer space, nobody knows you're a dog.
I think he is trying to tell us something.
Any news of Gérard Depardieu?
He wants us to try the method his species uses to identify each other.
Will someone please take this earthling to the poop deck!
Amazing, even their pets wear jewelry!
We've tried every language in the galaxy and we're no closer to knowing who's a good boy.
You thought it was just a big frisbee, didn't you boy, didn't you?
To boldly fetch where no dog has fetched before.
The planet BigBones approaches, Lord Barker.
At last! Intelligent life on Earth.
I stand corrected. There is intelligent life on earth after all.
I know it's demeaning Johnson but if they ask- you're the good boy.
Ok! Now, we just need peanut butter.
Bark once for 'I'm really a dog" and twice for "It's a transporter screwup.
Whatcha looking at? I'm just a dog. Ok, so I have a few fleas.
He appears to be from the planet K-9.
Inform Commander Laika she has a visitor.
If you ask me it's an antenna of some kind.
Our initial findings were wrong. There is intelligent life on this planet.
We find it to be highly intelligent. It has domesticated a two legged creature to walk with it to clean up after it, and to bring it food.
This one is a common species, a rap artist, if I'm not mistaken.
I have deciphered the Best Friend of Human's tail message. He wants to play ball.
This was only species that responded to 'STAY!'
Breeglot dooot phlom skiegor, Rex?
There really is a Dog!
Wait. Let me get this straight. The humans kidnapped you from your family and then did what to your genitals?
A perfect apparatus for human domination!
Contrary to what we thought, there is intelligent life down there.
Sometimes those electromagnetic fences just don't work.
The earthlings have a very unusual method of greeting each other.
Wow, they sure solved the hair loss problem!
Go get help!
We took their best friend, of course they'll surrender.
I found him at a stripper bar. He was the only one with his tail on backwards.
Well, you did say "beam up the smartest thing at the White house".
Stupid computer....I said "retrieve HER."
It seems the only thing they can't figure out is "Who's a good boy?"
It seems to command a sizeable staff of chaperones, cooks, and exercisers, plus free rent and medical care...definitely the planet's alpha.
Apparently it is their 'best friend'
You learned that men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and cats are from Uranus?
ok who's turn is it to put on all the gear and take him out....
Earthlings are much more advanced in development than I anticipated.
Good luck, agent Smith. We are confident the humans won’t suspect a thing.
Careful, he probes with his snout.
Well, what do you know? There really is a Dog.
This one actually listens.
It's far more intelligent than that Trump we found the last time we were here.
He’s a rescue, but sometimes it feels like he rescued me.
I mentioned a cat scan and he looked at me like i was from outer space
Captain, we await your orders
This one appears to be broken.
Imagine how dumb the one who picks up the poop must be.
Where's the pony?
Who’s the most intelligent life form on your planet? You are, yes you are!
Best abductee ever. This one like to snuggle.
Fly me to the moon.
I never had such a hard time sending back an abductee before!
Finally...an intelligent life form!
Houston, we have a problem.
Your mission is to find Pluto and bring him back.
How did you enslave the tall bipedal creatures?
Apparently the wagging appendage is a rudimentary form of communcation.
But you just went out 15 light years ago.
'So you're saying you're his best friend?'
The dog tag says return to Sputnik.
He was the smartest one we could find in The White House.
It looks harmless,but they rule the Earthlings.
What shithole planet are you from?
That's right. Stand at "Attention". Good aliens!
Pluto!
Can someone take me for a walk
Why do we have to beam him down every time he needs to take a leak?
And the canines have trained the earthlings to bring them food and clean up their poop. Now you tell me who's smarter.
He says the earthling has fallen down something called a 'well'.
Cute! Fun! How do earthlings get anything done?
We don't have space for a dog.
We decided to give on intelligence and go for character.
Finally! We have discovered an emotionally intelligent life-form in the universe!
Hi, I'm Scotty.
this was the smartest species
Your mission is to find Pluto.
And you say you know where this Dog Park is?
I still think that having him along to get us seven times faster in light years is not good science.
He went where no one has gone before.
Has doggie woggie been abducted by aliens? Yes he has! Good boy!
Well, it will seem a lot farther once you've converted from light years to dog years.
Timmy's fallen into a well?
Compared to the occupant of their White House this is clearly an advanced species!
One more time: you’ve got the wrong dog. I’m not Scottie!
After we observed all the leaders on earth, we beamed up the one we deemed the most intelligent.
Take us to your very stable genius leader.
We await your orders, Your Eminence.
I said I wanted a SPACE rover.
He and others like him have domesticated the erect two-legged species.
He comes and pees.
It’s very fetching.
This is an example of what earthlings call a "good boy."
You'll just have to wait till we stop at the next planet.
Gees, maybe there is a Dog.
Yes, you can go walkies. We have plenty of space.
Our language experts say that wagging the tail is its way of saying "Take me to your leader."
Awwww, he wuvs us.
That’s not a Scottie.
Really? This is their God? Are you sure we don't have it backwards?
So where’s the guy that was right behind me with the plastic bag?
So far our interrogation has determined that he's fluent in two languages - woof and arf!
Hi, I'm Pluto. I am not a planet...
Man’s best friend is the perfect disguise.
I love the subtlety of their language.
The creature radiates love. It's safe to land.
He can keep out invaders.
Amazing disguise, they never figured it out...
We'll call him Pluto.
Is this going to make a great lost dog poster or what?
Can we keep him daddy?
It must be special...they follow it around and pick up its poop!
It's your turn to float him. I've already been out twice today.
How far is that dog light years?
Oh, that's why you wanted a fire hydrant on board.
How would you like to visit a world that's not dog-eat-dog?
It's settled. We'll keep him.
But how does he get the two-legged beings to do his bidding?
Dammit Brork, not this kind of rover!
We beamed up the most humane specimen.
We were told their leader was barking mad, so....
He says he's from Sirius, but I have my doubts.
Are you sure this is the most intelligent species on the planet?
They call it a K9.
Tell us, what is this squirrel you speak of ?
I'm sure he is important. People pick up his poop.
I said, "Beam me up a Scotty", not a Lab.
Your trip will take 3.6 dog light years.
He doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
It's not Pluto.
I guess there is intelligent life on Earth.
He must be the most important being on the planet, the other life forms pick up his excrement!
Their slaves pick up after them
Hit the dog gone button, will ya?
Roll over, stay, teleport.
YOU NEED TO SEE A DOG ABOUT A MAN?
The bipeds appear to worship cats. You chase them. Please explain.
Why? Intelligent life is overrated. We're searching the Universe for unconditional love.
...and they have these servants that scoop their poop, feed and house them, and all at no cost to them - of course they're the master race.
See, I was right - life on this planet is even more intelligent than we first thought.
Nevermind. He's from a shithole galaxy.
He appears to be somewhat smarter than the human 'President' we recently abducted.
Pet? I assumed the guy who could lick his privates was the leader.
Twenty bucks says I can get the humans to cleanup my poop, let me destroy their favorite shoes and afterwards they'll call me their best friend.
We too wish to enslave humans. So, how'd you do it?
I hear they're easier to train than human beings.
He seems to be their leader.
Fido: fetch the human.
Translation is difficult with Earthlings but I believe he said, "Who's a good boy?"
A bacteria farm! AND its container!
Finally, an intelligent life form from this planet.
Normally we'd ask to be taken to your leader, but we've been monitoring your media broadcasts, and I think we'll just stay with you.
Your owner must have thrown the ball really far.
Humans? Yeah, they make great servants. They bring you food, clean up after you, and they give great belly rubs!
I told you we were spelling it backwards.
Awwwww . . . can we keep it?
It's their leader alright--the other creature was walking 5 steps behind and gathering his waste.
And don't say, "take me to your leader". They don't really have one.
We beam him down, he marks some territory, we beam him up.
The most intelligent earthling we've seen so far.
I don't see the resemblance to our home star.
Thinking there mission a success, the alien crew didn't realize it was a miscommunication with high command that lead them to capture Mr. Spot.
Why so Sirius?
Surely you can't be Sirius?
Right now we're only about 17 light years away. How many dog years is that?
First, thank you for coming alone and not bringing your pet human.
Fetch us to your leader.
The consensus of humans we have studied is that you're a very good boy.
I said to beam up a god! G-O-D!
OK, we'll beam it out into space this time. But then just put down a damn puppy pad.
He's been following us for the last 7 light-years. Can I keep him?
The earthlings relieve themselves everywhere and have servants to clean up after them!!
Interesting, it's already shown more intelligence than the "Leader of the free world"
Yes, Captain, we definitely have enough kibble to reach Canis Major.
Tell us more of tummy rubs.
Must be a problem with transmission but Zoltan will always be my best friend
Rear sensor movement indicates not aggressive.
Good girl, you caught a really big Frisbee this time didn't you?
You were supposed to bring back the Sunday paper.
You mean the one who cleans up your poop is The Leader?
Who was in charge of applying the latest security patch?
I ordered a wookie but they were all out.
Okay, great. Now take me out for a walk.
We have tried everything and we just can't decode the meaning of the tail thumps.
So I'm a talking dog. What's the big deal?
We’re pleased to meet such an intelligent leader... the last planet we visited brought us to something they called a “Trump”.
Do any of you know what a walkie is?
Who’s an intelligent life form??
Tell your masters we don't want any more visitors from your shithole planet.
Open the doggie door HAL.
Just based on those in charge this was the smartest creature.
We have finally found it: the highest life form in the universe.
From the way they treat her, she must be their leader.
Actually, I meant a human life-form more intelligent than their president.
What? You say Zanpher fell down the well?
I take it your meeting with the Earthlings went well?
Bring back more dogs. No humans.
Quickly, someone grow a tail so we can reply to his greeting!
So, as their best friend, what’s their problem?
We know you're in charge, we saw the other earthlings following behind you and picking up your poop.
This is one of the creatures that commands the planet's big-brained bipeds to pick up its feces.
We scoured the earth for signs of intelligent life . . .
So, the disguise worked but they took your what?
No, I said "Beam me up a Scotty".
We need to know everything about your best friend.
This creature claims to represent the dominant species. Do you see how it is using advanced binary tail wagging language?
Not sure which Lab he came from
Transport that ring of piss back to earth! Keep the dog.
I saw humans cleaning up after them. They must be the real leaders of this world.
Dying planet, questionable people, but he looks like a good boy.
The captain says, if you want a friend on this spaceship, get a dog.
Should we take him for a float?
I think he needs to go.
So tell us more about your best friend.
I think he wants us to retrieve something from planet Labrador.
Yes, I'm their leader now. The country finally ran out of qualified candidates.
Maybe there is intelligent life on earth.
Finally a sign of intelligent life on Earth.
Take us to your, like, really smart, stable genius, non-reader leader.
Well, we did program the damn transporter to deliver the most intelligent life form on the planet.
It's the only intelligent life form we could find down there.
And when you meet the President, don't start serious negotiations until he sniffs all your butts.
Oh! I thought you said "Take me to your breeder"
Finally, we've found the mysterious good boy.
Now to figure out why humans worship this creature so much.
Wow. I can't believe he's wagging his tail after we just blew up his planet.
Can we keep it? Please!
What's the problem? You said to go down and bring up the most intelligent being you can find.
I understand their language and speak yours.
He may look harmless, but his enthusiasm for chasing flying discs could prove to be a problem.
Finally, a planet with an intelligent life-form.
It's some kind of god for them, they call it a Labradoodle.
Thank god! Last time we got Trump.
The doggy door may be a problem.
Do you think he needs to go out?
It's okay. I abducted him from a shelter, not a pet store.
These humans are smarter than we expected.
Back to Earth? Are you sure?
Of course I'm Sirius!
What can you tell us about Chief Orange Hair?
This is their most intelligent species.
Sir, we believe this to be the best specimen from that shithole planet below.
Considering how the bi-pedal earth creatures pamper them, we may have just identified the planet’s highest life form.
Dammit! I told you to beam up a Scottie!
He appears to be a very stable genius.
Did you try turning it off and on again?
This one certainly seems a lot more sensible than the so-called leader of that planet
So all we have to do is lick their faces and they will feed us ?
Where’s the nearest fire hydrant?
Hi, my name is Scotty...
His flexitor rod appears to be telling us to go back to the shithole from whence we came.
Someone Google translate what the alien is saying - "Woof"?
Based on his planet's condition, this Earthling is a lot smarter than I thought it'd be.
I don't think he's their leader-- he looks too intelligent.
Well, whatever it is, it's just so darned cute!
"i thought we ordered a pizza".
It's taken a while but this is definitely the finest sample so far.
Don't worry Max, the captain said there is a lamp post at our next stop in the Milky Way Galaxy.
Their antenna is wagging too fast
What does 'rake me to your reader' mean?
Who's a good inferior species? You are. Yes you are!
Trust me, he's better than their leader
This is the apparent ruler of the planet. Despite having a signicantly larger brain, humans follow them around constantly collecting their waste.
The results of the probe show the earthlings' diet consists of shoe soles, grass and tennis balls
I CHECKED 2 BONES .. WHERE ARE THEY ?
Who is the good boy that just defied the laws of physics?
Well this is a pleasant surprise. We'd only been able to pick up Fox News.
I hope to be half the alien you think I am.
We finally found intelligent life on earth.
We were expecting a Scottie.
Now, we deploy our Mars Rover.
Really? You need to go out now?
He just keeps saying : "Take me to your breeder."
It calls itself ARF
So much more intelligent than those hairless bipeds we came across last year.
I teleported a stick and this came back.
It appears to be some sort of space rover.
He looks just like my great grandfather.
I'm more of a cat alien.
I already took him for a space walk twice today
He reports that conditions on Earth are ruff right now.
#Area51PetAdoptions
Every day at 5 o’clock earth time he acts like this
So tell us, how did you train the bipedal humans to pick up your feces?
When we mentioned the planet's name is Hydrant, he didn't hesitate.
I’ve run the mind scan, but all I see is a big bowl of food.
Humans are such a diverse race.
There IS intelligent life on earth!
I must have said “beam me up a Scottie.”
Your disguise is perfect, X51. Remember, defecate anywhere and sniff crotches.
At last we've found emotionally intelligent life.
Definitely Canis Major.
We found these 4 legged masters being waited on by their 2 legged servants.
Hmmmm! More intelligent than we thought.
At last! A superior form of life!
This appears to be a much more friendly & advanced lifeform than what we've observed at recent White House Press briefings. He says his name's Spot and that there are many more asylum seekers like him.
I don't think this is what the leader meant when he said "Capture the Lab"
I like him. He listens so carefully.
Fine, but I'm not going to be the one to let him out in the middle of the night.
What's that, boy? Timmy is stuck down a black hole?
My views are skewed, I must confess. I have only been men's best friend. You need to talk to a cat.
I said "beam me up Scotty" not "beam me up Spotty"!
I’m thinking we abducted the wrong Rover.
Just so you know, I don't eat dried food.
We have them almost completely under our control.
At last an intelligent specimen from earth.
He looks smarter than the leader we beamed up from Mar-a-Lago.
His mission is to boldly fetch where no dog has fetched before.
He seems a little too eager to take us to his leader.
They became the planet's most intelligent life-form two Novembers ago.
'He looks to be a very stable genius.'
According to our research, this is the smartest creature on Earth.
I clearly said 'Beam up DOUG!'
Who is Timmy, and what is a well?
So, we have an agreement: We won't probe you, and you'll stop humping our legs.
Since the other creature picked up his poo I guess he's the one in charge.
I think we found the first sign of intelligent life.
Seriously? These allegedly intelligent "humans" don't sniff each other's butts?
I ran a simple FETCH statement, puzzling...
We must find out how he trained the two-legged earthlings to do all the work.
We're beaming him back. He didn't like our food.
I just said Klaatu Barada Nikto and he came.
He followed me back to the ship. Can I keep him?
What is it like to live on planet earth?" "Ruff
He's no Scottie, but beam him up anyway.
Of course, since their language is opposite ours, they call him "d-o-g".
Sure, you can sniff the probe when we're done.
Well, monkeys didn't work. Let's try this.
Tell us everything.
He says just by oscillating his rear antenna he can get the humans to do his bidding
He thinks he caught the biggest frisbee.
He came to tell us: “Wag more bark less”.
Wait, its antenna is clearly in reception mode.
You want me to fetch their leader?
So how do you guys howl at the moon from up here?
He looked a lot cuter in the videos.
Other than humping my leg he doesn’t do much
It took us 3 light years to get here... that would be 21 in dog years.
So this is Scotty
Who's a good earthling? Are you a good earthling?
What is that in light years?
... and what is really impressive is it can like its own balls!
No way, Pluto's your cousin?!
Don't look at me like that, Dave. I set the coordinates for 'most intelligent organism in Washington'.
Even though they are a lower life form, they have trained the humans to take good care of them.
I saw it leading the other one- it's clearly in charge.
We have crossed the galaxy in search of a good boy.
I think they are starting to suspect us of spying for you guys. I don’t want to be their best friend. Plus dog food sucks. Cant we stick to being UFO’s?
Weren’t you going to beam me up a Scotty?
Please, please can we keep it?
In my defense, this does look a little like a frisbee.
Finally, proof of intelligent life on Earth!
It is clearly the dominant species, as it has trained a larger creature to dispose of its excrement.
Finally........intelligent life.
The dyslexic Martians' search for God was doomed from the beginning.
....only sign of intelligent life on that planet.
Okay, we can keep him. But I’m not refueling him.
The re-animator ray must have a reverse spelling error today.
Finally someone intelligent I can talk to.
No, there's no intelligent life down there. Bring me with you to your shithole planet.
Yes, we're sure. He’s the one they worship.
Yes, we can understand you. And, no, you cannot stick your head out the window.
Observe the curious reaction when all I do is mention we're from the planet Treat.
Are you the Mars Rover?
"He followed me home. Can we keep him?
Who's the best earthling? Who is? That's right! You are!
Well, he seems more like a very stable genius than the last guy we had up here.
He appeared to be their leader.
Even has a larger species follow and pick up his poop!
I think he said, 'Take me to your fire hydrant.'
Who's going to tell our Leader that we changed our minds about breeding with the earthlings?
Surprisingly, these Earthlings are smarter than we expected.
It Is confusing! ...and then you have to consider dog years.
Commander, we’ve intercepted a vehicle operated by flea people.
What is a tennis ball?
The cat didn't work out.
I thought you said to say 'Take me to your breeder'!
So much for that invisible fence!
Earthlings are more advanced than we thought.
He wants us to take him to the Dog Star.
Apparenty, this was the most intelligent creature to be found.
That’s not what I meant when I said to bring in the space rover.
And how were you able to convince them you were their best friend?
Well the rumor just became a reality. The human race is surely going to the dogs.
I said bring me their GOD not their DOG.
It's your turn to take him outside.
No. Too much like the last one. If we probe its rear it'll just think we mean hello.
Oh look, he left us a little gift.
He followed me home - can I keep him?
And what are those creatures you've trained to follow you and clean up for you?
I think he has to go out.
Let's call it 'cat'.
He says they rule the Earth, and the cats have the humans as pets.
Sir, you said to beam up their leader. This guy had someone following him around picking up his poo, so I figured...
Really, I did bring the intelligent one.
Captain, we have deciphered his language. He wants to know where the grass is. It's urgent!
It may not seem like the dominant species, but it has several bipedal slaves.
You said to bring back the most intelligent being we could find...
It's a deal then. You take all of our planet's tennis balls, and we get all of your planet's cats.
Should we call him Pluto?
All he does is bay at the moon.
At least we found some intelligent life on that planet.
We have examined this human specimen and found it to be warm, compassionate, loyal, and friendly, not at all like we were led to believe.
Somehow I was expecting a Scottie, not a Lab.
There really is a Dog!
Send back this dog and tell them to beam up a Scottie.
I was expecting a scottie
This is the smartest human we've beamed up yet!
You did tell me to find a 'good boy.'
Unlike other life forms of life on earth, this one does not follow his tail.
You beamed this up from Earth; now you figure out where to walk it!
It's taken us 10,000 years, but we are this close to running everything.
Hey that's not a Scottie.
The universal translator says he's asking to go out.
Do the humans realize you're in control?
Claims he's Sirius the Dog Star.
It followed me up here. Can we keep it?
Our search for intelligent life finally concludes.
He is saying he was fine with the probe and would like to reciprocate.
Actually it's pronounced "yurr-en-us"--but, to answer your question, I don't know what it smells like.
I think the phrase is, "What's shaking, earthling?"
He says we're his new best friends.
So 27 wags means yes, right?
How do you get them pick up your poo?
You did have it set to only abduct intelligent life.
Well, if it looks like a dog, barks like a dog, and smells like a dog...
Are you the Curiosity, rover?
Notice the uncertain tail wag when I mention going for a walk.
We know he's a member of the master class. He had an assistant to pick up his poop.
You got me an brownie machine! I love earth brownies! Thank you, Zorg!
I think he is trying to tell us that Earth's in trouble!
Given what we saw on the planet, I would definitely call him a 'rescue'.
The posterior antenna, do you think it's broadcasting pictures of us?
It says its leader is a very stable genius that enjoys tweeting.
Are you the 'good boy' we're looking for?
Did anyone remember to grab some plastic bags?
I said Scotty, not Spotty!
Greetings Earthling. We understand you have trained humans to provide you with food, shelter, health care, and attention. You are the dominate species on the planet.
Well Elon, it's not exactly what we were thinking as the Mars Rover.
DYSLEXIC MARTIANS IN SEARCH OF GOD
This contradicts our preliminary research that there's no intelligent life on Planet Earth ...
Beware the ocillating appendage on its rear!
At long last, we have the President.
We were told that you know how to locate Uranus.
Another Roswell rescue. The tabloids love us.
"This one seems much more intelligent than the president".
What do you mean, "you have to pick up after him"?
Bones is off of teleportation duty.
He's got to be their leader. I found him having to pull another type of creature along with a rope.
I requisitioned a fully functioning lab... and they sent this.
Capt. Kirk said it would be a Scotty.
This simple dog disguise let me enslave the humans.
Act lovable until we signal the general attack.
It can sit, but can it speak?
Ok, then we can safely assume that all Earthlings are happy, loving, and welcoming of new people!
Deliver this message to all mankind.
Careful! He charms and enslaves two-legged beings.
Who's Timmy, and what's a well?
I think he wants to go outside
Why does the antenna keep moving?
The best part, he's a rescue.
I believed the new creature is confused about which moon to howl at.
I'm not sure how he got here, but according to his collar, he belongs to a Professor Schrodinger.
Oh look at his cute tail wag! Okay. We spare this planet.
Don’t take us to your leader.
Walking him might be a problem.
Take me to your feeder!
I don't care how they communicate, just find some trees.
It seems to absorb infinite amounts of sunlight.
Yes Laika. You can go home. It's just that they're not expecting you.
What do you think he means by 'Woof?'
I just programmed the transporter to send up the most intelligent occupant of the White House!
We'll call him "Rover"
So guys, have you seen my ball?
Who is your best friend?
Remember, some galaxies enforce the pooper scooper laws.
Hey, Jerry. Why would their leader wear a collar?
in space everyone knows you're a dog
From all the poop we're seeing, I think we've abducted a politician!
I'm afraid we have no bones.
Watch out for the tail. It may be a weapon.
He's not my leader
I believe this is a close encounter of the canine.
'Because you can'? For this we traveled twenty million light years?
What is it boy? Zandar fell into the tachyon tube?
You told us to bring back the most intelligent life form.
Well, he's the one with the collar, so he must be the dominant species.
Another space walk already! Whose idea was it to capture this life form anyway?
Sorry, no shithole on board.
I say we send him back, we don't need another dog from a shithole planet
And to think we despaired of ever finding intelligent life in the White House!
I met him on the internet. He's very rich.
But he’s so good. We have to find a place for him on the ship!
Again? but you were just out!
Yes, finally we captured one of their leaders
….then the neighbor's black and white cat hissed at me, so I …..
According to the lease, this was the leader.
Meow?
So that's how far away in Dog-years?
Yes, its a long journey, but really, how many blue bags do we need?
See? Pluto really DOES exist
What have you done? I wanted to see their G-O-D!
I hope he's UFO broken.
This is the best friend that our abductee mentioned.
Now that you have their confidence, we have a mission for you.
He wants to know who will take him for his morning walk
When I said I wanted a woofer installed in the transport; that's not what I meant.
Does somebody want to go O-U-T for a S-P-A-C-E-W-A-L-K?
The dog, second only to the dolphin in intelligence on the planet....less wet, too.
Based on our intel, he can smell fear and chase his tail.
What I wouldn't give for a universal translator.
And try to get on their internet. No one will know who you are.
Do you think the mothership will let us keep him?
Let's name him Rover.
Do you need to go out?
Where should we put the doggie door?
Sure,everyone wanted to abduct a dog, but I knew I would be stuck walking him
Well this is an elaborate game of fetch.
This is intelligent life.
Do you get the feeling that he wants to stick his head out of the window?
Someone needs to take me for a space walk, NOW!
Siri thought that I barked, "Take me to Canis Major"
It always seems happy to see me.
I think this earthling could be a loyal and trusty friend.
we found laika
This is the most intelligent species on Earth -- sometimes they can even train the humans!
Just remember to sniff everything and be as obsequious as possible.
Fooled me. I thought your so-called "flying saucer" was a Frisbee.
We asked for loyalty from your leaders and this is it?
It's all going to plan, Earth is going to the dogs.
Earthly ? No, Siriusly.
Why yes, we love to play fetch too!
Bad news. I think he wants to go for a walk.
How cute. It's wagging its probe.
He’s man’s best friend; not ours.
Who is Woof?
This one looked more intelligent than the bipedal creature it was with.
Does anyone else feel understood?
"All he can say is, 'Take me to your ball', whatever that is?
I thought I was clear when I told you two to take Area 51's lab
Ok...better this time, but it's still not a Scottie...
Believe me, this is the smartest earthling we could find.
Thank you wise one for teaching us the beauty of butt-sniffing!
This species seems, like, smarter than their leader.
These must be the leaders as the tall ones follow them and retrieve their excrement.
Who's a good blarnk? You're a good blarnk!
Whadda you mean we need an appointment to meet the cat?
Here, reporting back from earth. The delusion of mankind's superiority remains even as they continue to pick up my feces, daily.
Good luck, Agent S. The humans will be helpless in your presence.
He makes more sense than their leader.
I’m not lying, this is the creature whose waste the humans were picking up.
What's that, boy? Trouble in the old Milky Way?
Our surveillance shows that these are the leaders of the Bipeds.
I guess we got his best friend instead.
Doug forgot the “u” again.
I thought we were supposed to beam up a Scotty.
So there IS intelligent life on this planet!
If he takes over the ship, it'll be a Plutocracy.
You must be Good Boy.
First of all, it's clear that we have to find a way to communicate with these people.
Travel companions, say hello to the most intelligent creature on Planet Earth.
Let us see what Man does now without his best friend!
No matter where I leave her, she always finds a way back home
This must be their leader. He has more followers and stories shared about him than any being on Earth.
Theres no reason to be nervous, we're vegan.
I swear, it wasn't me, it was the dog.
This is an awfully complicated ruse just to get him to the V-E-T.
The vet said we should give you more space.
Do either of you have an uncontrollable urge to ask if the boss we can keep him.
He is much clever then us! We are not able to understand his language but he is able to influence our minds to ask food!
My mental brain scan tells me he still doesn't know who's a good boy.
It's your turn to take him out.
I could no longer cut it as mans's best friend.
I told you we should have used a Scottie.
I don't care if he followed you, you can't keep him.
My hunch is that "Beam me up Scottie" isn't working because he's a labrador.
All I can tell you is that they're very loyal.
Must be the dominant species -- other creatures pick up its droppings.
Interesting. Can you do anything else?
Good...boy...?
Earthlings don’t look anything like us.
He’s the most welcoming and faithful species on the planet and he loves leftovers.
I can’t believe we always spelled it backwards!
Congratulations, you've escaped the dog-eat-dog world.
You'll like the other spaceship better; they have a real fire hydrant!
We're looking to find out how you train them to leave their house late at night and be dragged against their will to someplace you want to take them.
You just beamed up Scottie.
Initially, it scans as more intelligent than those other types of specimens we’ve been beaning up.
He remembers going up for a frisbee.
He appears much more advanced than their orange leader.
Do you want to go out?
It ate my homework.
We need your help solving one of the most puzzling mysteries of the universe; "who's a good boy?"
Did they really think a cute dog would distract us from everything else going on down there? Actually, I think it's working.
His great-great-great-great grandfather was one of Pavlov's dogs.
But I said “Beam me up a Scottie.”
We said "no pets" in the listing, didn't we?
They'll never suspect you, Zyrkimos. Just bring us back some bones.
Where's the ball!?
What's that boy? Timmy fell down the wormhole?
Says he wants a chest rub, 2 cases of bones and a "no leash agreement" or he's not talking.
At last, we found something worth saving!
YOU'RE the leader??
Which one of you likes to take long walks?
This cow we ordered from Amazon looks different from the textbook.
Yes, its true, as time goes on the master looks more and more like his dog.
It isn't intelligent life as we know it but then we can't fetch a ball like it can.
Artie will find out if the humanoids are friendly or not. We'll beam him down to a yard located by a structure known as the "Whitehouse."
Thank you for believing in us.
This confirms “there is a Dog”!
Just act like you're their best friend.
His eyes say, "Don't abduct me," but his tail screams, "Take me with you!"
You're the first person who's ever been glad to see us.
I wish I was the martian he thinks I am.
He's the most friendly earthling we could find.
Those humans actually pick up your what?
We're sorry about your master, my furry guest, but we don't know what a well is.
No one suspects dogs.
Do you think Mom and Dad will let us keep him?
Really, they just follow me around and pick up my poop.
Love this mind-reading thing, but trust me, you don't really want me to take you to our leader.
Are all Earthling's breath this terrible.
What really happened to Laika
This switch is for the betterment of mankind. Do we have the correct coordinates for the Oval Office?
Take us to your leader.....oh, never mind.
Did you sneak over the wall illegally too?
You said to find a friendly being, so I did.
How many people do you own?
Finally - a species that is excited to see us!
How can we turn this scenario into a demeaning no creativity Trump cartoon, for the New Yorker?
Commander Rufus has agreed to stand down the attack on our world in exchange for 3 strips of bacon.
So, there is intelligent life on earth afterall!
Can you show us where this Timmy is?
It must be the dominant life form. The bipeds walk behind it, collect its excrement and preserve it in plastic.
Now you're OUR best friend.
Pavlovs revenge, If I bite them what will they do?
Cute, but no opposable thumb.
So let me get this straight - you wag your tail and they do everything you want?
OK, you guys can smell my butt, but you can't probe it.
He says, "I'm a good boy. I'm a good boy. Chase giant frisbee. I'm a good boy."
It is the ninth version of their model K unit.
I want to believe.
From what I can tell they outrank humans and are definitely cuter.
Our research shows it's by far the most intelligent species on the planet.
They call this creature "Who's a Good Boy."
You beamed him up. You walk him.
In outer space, no one can hear you bark.
We voted you off the space ship.
What do you mean by "Woof?"
I don’t understand. I just space walked him ten minutes ago.
I'm just their dog. If you want to communicate with them you need to speak English.
He is their leader. They call him Duke.
How do you get them to pick up your poop? Your species is clearly running things down there.
We have our disguise!
I told you to stay!
"We're sending you down boy, down".
Take us to your leader, and we don't mean President Trump.
You’re species is obviously in charge. We observed how they follow and pick up your poo.
No matter what I ask I keep getting the same answer.
We're hoping you'll be our best friend instead.
When you get down there, bark at the orange one with the bad hair.
We finally meet with earths most intelligent species.
I'm still not sure about intelligent life yet, but they refer to these as 'Good Boys'...
Tell us again how you got them to feed you and clean up after you....
"He followed me home. Can we keep him?
Please explain to us why the 'I Love Lucy' space transmissions have abruptly ceased?
A superior species! They employ humans to pick after them.
Who’s a good earthling?
let's try this time to find women's best friend
Can you be Sirius for a minute?
Our captain sure likes to bark orders.
Are you letting me off at the Dog Star?
Which one of you is Alpha ?
The inhabitants of this planet seem to communicate with their tails.
Now we may finally learn how to convert light years into dog years.
I said, "Beam me up a Scotty" and they sent me this mutt!
Well, he's certainly friendlier than that two-legged specimen we had earlier. No tail wagging with that one.
I think its communicating back to earth through the moveable antenae at its base!
Their god or their dog. We won't know which until we decipher the direction in which to read their language.
So, when you throw the ball it NEVER comes back?
So , there is intelligent life on earth!
We want to learn to wag more.
Do all earthlings communicate with noses in your groin?
I think this Earthling is ready to play ball.
So this what we get when we ask the ship to beam up someone from Earth we can trust.
The Scotty beam-up wasn't working so they sent me.
After close observation,I believe the answer is ; because he can.
They really can train a dog to do anything.
This is the galaxy's brightest star? Siriusly?
They seem like a peace-loving people.
He said beam me up Scotty, not beam up a Scottie!
Our assumptions about this planet have been the worst ones yet. But he is cute.
I'm not xenophobic. Feed me and I will be your friend forever.
I took him out last time..
Had to get far away from that "shithole"
He must be their leader. His servants follow him around and pick up his poop.
You can't be Sirius.
He must be important. The two-legged ones were picking up his fecal matter.
We too are interested in butts.
He's not a Scottie, is he?
Yes, he's clearly the leader. He lies around all day getting fed by others.
What's that, girl? You say Timmy's trapped in a black hole?
The feline said this was the master controller.
Of course he's the dominant species! His reverent subjects even follow him in order to collect his waste.
I said SPOCK, you idiot, not SPOT!
Welcome back. Report to the captain for your debriefing.
Too bad humans don't learn from their best friends, this is the best specimen of Earth.
Now, how do we get rid of fleas?
Space Commander Roxy, you must defend them against the coming frisbee, tennis ball, and squirrel rebellion.
.pihsrow yeht eno eht si siht tub sredael ynam evah yehT
Research shows that you are compatible with these life forms.
I'm telling you, he was the leader, he was leading the other creature around.
Really? He's the only one at 1600 Pennsylvania who hasn't lied, blamed, obfuscated, or robbed from the poor to give to the rich?
Every time I meld with its brain, it compares me to something called a "fire hydrant."
What’s that, Lassie? Timmy got sucked down a gravity well?
Tell us about your best friend
If he poos on my carpet, you're cleaning it up.
He knows 'sit,' 'stay' and 'wait to be teleported.'
Are you the one called, Good Boy?
He says Timmy needs our help.
He doesn't want to go back to Russia.
Superior? Yet they follow you and pick up your waste.
I said Scotty, not Spotty!
Boss says we have to take him, diversity requirements !
So that's what humans look like.
We blew away the planet. But we kept this thing; it looked fun.
Cool fetch!
'Actually, some dogs go to Saturn.'
We were seeking GOD?
Our president sent me up to sniff you to see if you come from a Shithole galaxy or one that smells more like Norway.
I said, “Scotty – beam him up” – not “beam up a scotty!”
Okay, so she's not the leader of their free world. Anyone complaining?
Yes, I am sure this is a young one of the species. I heard him repeatedly being called a "good boy".
It is kind of like a big Frisbee...
Instead of abducting another species we decided to just ask, ‘Who wants to go for a ride?’
I had no choice. He picked me.
Let's see if it's microchipped.
Who's a higher life-form? Who? That's right, you are.
We’ll tell everyone he’s a rescue.
He seems very sweet and intelligent. Are you sure he's from Earth?
He's kind of cute.
Why don't they let this species elect their President?
You two approach, I'm standing back. I saw how it greeted his other friends.
Do you prefer Woof or Arf ?
This species is the master of bipeds who feed, clean, and shelter them.
We can celebrate the ambassador's arrival by throwing a ball!
Looks like the evolution here has a way to go before intelligent life appears...
Aww, he's just so cute. Let's spare him the anal probe.
I believe it is saying it wants to go back to 'Shithole
I believe we've discovered a lunar Rover.
How do you get others to clean up for you?
There! there - you see: tap, wag-wag-wag - and then, again - tap, wag-wag-wag. I told you that the Earthling is trying to tell us something...
It's called a dog. It has at least three bad habits.
What's that? Xargon's trapped in a quandle loop?
Honestly... I don’t know if I want to go out.
He wants us to sniff his butt.
What's that, girl? Timmy fell down the gravity well?
Remember, guys, don’t let the dog out.
I said; “beam me up a scottie” and they sent a retriever.
You're dyslexia has struck again, Carl. My order was for you to find this "God" figure so many humans worship.
The tag says 'phone home.'
He said I really need to go for a walk outside.
Cool, this one's already tagged and microchipped.
Earth was great. All I had to do was wag my tail and they treated me like God
I'm more of a cat martian.
It's okay Fella! We took your owner to live at a beautiful space farm upstate.
Tell us how you train them to pick up your poop.
They don't talk or contribute to upkeep. They smell bad, fart frequently, and like to lick earthlings' private parts. But they're considered man's best friend. It's a mystery.
Woof me up!
I think she wants to go for a spacewalk.
Are you Scotty?
That's not what I expected them to look like.
This is the disguise we'll wear. This is the species that rules the homes.
You've got the wrong guy - my name is Buddy - Scotty's tied up today.
See if ET says this is the earthling he laments leaving behind.
I said we needed something for lab research, not a Labrador Retriever.
He's a Mars Rover.
Please don’t take us to your leader...
You realize she is going to be hard to hide from our mother ship!
It calls itself ARF
I said, beam up the captain’s log!
Oh hey there buddy-” “Um, actually my name is Brian.
He followed me. Can I keep him? Please, please. I will take good care of him. Please daddy.
She's a rescue. She was on a bad planet.
Darn. I asked for a Scotty.
Who is ready for the space walk?
It appears the tail is its communication apparatus but I'm unable crack the dactylology.
He's saying he wants to go outside.
Rover ready for deployment.
I did NOT say beam up a Scottie!
You wanted to negotiate with the most trustworthy living organism on Earth. This is it.
Yes, there were other creatures in the vehicle, sir. But this one seemed more inclined to welcome us to their planet.
Wag once for yes, twice for no.
We're genuinely confused. They actually think humans are great.
The inhabitants of this planet seem smart, kind, and compassionate...let's let them be.
Maybe it's some sort of clock....
Welcome aboard Mr. President
I question your shape-shifting choices, lieutenant, but wish you well on your mission.
Can you create a species to take care of us too?
Wow!! Are you Sirius??!!
They did say there would be a lot of space to run.
Easy boy, what are you trying to say? Who is Timmy.. and what is a well?
Now that we have man's best friend, we'll be able to know all their secrets.
This is Sirius.
Willie! You must return the Frisbee to Odor before he crushes us like bugs!
Be careful, that cat wagged its tail, too.
Where's the terrier? We expected Scotty!
I didn't realize we'd have to walk him.
Perhaps we mistranslated their word for "God.
Do you boys hunt?
They are more evolved then we imagined.
I’ll take you, but my leader is gonna make you sit.
The bipeds feed them, bathe them and use little bags to clean up after them during their “walks.” Clearly dogs are in command.
Suit-up it's your turn to take him for a walk.
Now that we have the smartest being on Earth let’s begin
Greetings, Rex, king of Earth.
Are they STILL trying to make 'fetch' happen?
We like to think he abducted us.
``What's that? Zarg's fallen down a wormhole and can't get out?"
I'm telling you guys. On my planet I take you out for a walk to do your bussiness
We can see you're species is in charge. But tell us, why do you make them carry your poop around?
So, you must be the leader.
It looks like the probe is already in this one
We got him at the White House.. We think it might be the president.
The humans have been destroyed, my liege. Shall I remove the collar?
Arf? Is that all you can say?
THIS will attract June Lockhart!
I'm not really sure what it is but I can tell you it's definately not Human...It's too happy to be Human
Bark. Bark, bark, bark.
Now to beam him back so he can communicate our secret of happiness to all Earthlings!
How do you get them to clean up after you?
Wow! We beamed up an Alpha earthling. I’ve seen its supplicants trailing behind and scooping up its excrement.
OK, fellas. I will teach you to fetch, play, and avoid the US news.
We’ve been following the news down there and we think it’s high time you found a new best friend.
Met him on the internet. Didn't know he was a dog.
Take us to your fire hydrant.
Oh, all right, we won’t send you back if you promise to stop marking.
This obviously is an advanced civiliation. His rear antenna operates on an oscillating frequency.
Captain Bingo, we can't chase every starship that flies by or we'll run out of fuel before we get home.
You are man's best friend. Tell us everything.
Are you sure this is the only specimen on the planet that loves unconditionally?
Oh no! The dog ate Captain Kirk's transponder again!
I said "beam me up a Scotty", you idiot.
It doesn't look like a Scottie!
Do you think Mom will let us keep him?
According to this thing called Instagram, this is human offspring.
We have crossed the galaxy to know, who's a good boy?
Typical. I requisition a rover and they beam up Rover.
One of our UFOs is waiting to take you home
We dogs have come a long way, baby, since Laika went into orbit by herself in 1957.
Admiral, we have eliminated the squirrel planet as commanded.
He's not talking.
I’m not taking him outside for his walk.
Finally, we've found some intelligent life on Earth!
„Our undercover agent speaks with his tail now. I think he says that after spending a year on planet Earth undetected, he doesn‘t want his body to be transformed back. And could we please rub his belly?“
I have no idea. Bring in that little meowing creature we beamed up yesterday and let's see what happens.
Beam me up Scooby.
What's that you say? You're not in charge? We read it backwards?
The Earthling is saying he wants a cookie
Is he a rover?
I'm telling you, on the Internet, NOBODY knew he was a dog.
And with your "Service Dog" vest, you can infiltrate any facility needed.
Behold, we have captured their God.
I thought we were getting a Scotty to beam us up.
So this is what earthlings call unconditional love.
Why don't you drop the 'Mars.' Just try 'Rover.'
He just followed me home.
I’ll go open a window so he can stick his head out.
Take us to your leader!
You're a good little specimen, yes you are!
Can I keep it? Huh? Can I? Please?
You tell him he can't go out for a walk.
What's that? They're having a constitutional crisis?
The specimen has no rent, no job, no debt, no worries - intelligent life indeed!
We set the system to beam up the highest being with empathy in that big white house
Don't say "w-a-l-k" again!
We misplaced one of our probes and had to abduct an experienced butt sniffer.
He’s clearly their leader. We just haven’t figured out yet how he makes them obey.
The most highly evolved being on your planet you are. Live in the White House you should.
Good doggie. Now beam and fetch.
He must be their leader, they were all scurrying around to feed him and pick up his poop!
Why yes, we do have squirrels on our planet.
When you get back, here’s what we want you to do.
He says there is intelligent life on planet Earth, but not of the two-legged variety.
It followed me may I keep it?
Your dyslexia has struck again, Carl. I ordered you to find this "God" figure so many humans love.
So how did you get them to carry your poop in a bag?
I think it's called a 'stable genius'.
Tell us if you can - What goes on in the Black Lab?
You want us to pick up what?
Interesting. It's name is "woof", it comes from the planet "woof", and it's leader is "woof".
It appeared to be the only intelligent life on the third planet.
One of you have to walk me!
This must be Seth Meyers.
He said he would never take us to his leader… but on the other hand there’s also nothing he wouldn’t do for a dog biscuit.
they call it a frisbee
Beam him down, Scotty, he’s got to “go.”
Muttnik be damned!
You tell him there are no fireplugs up here."
I found him howling at the moon.
He looks different,... but he speaks our language
He prefers to be beamed up as a labradoodle.
This seemed to be the most intelligent being we could find, and he was a very good boy.
Don't bother with the humans, it's the cats you need to be worried about.
So there is intelligent life there after all.
make the earthlings believe you are their best friend...
...and they have trained bipeds that seem to be at their beck and call.
We're beaming you up, Spotty
Now that's a good retriever!
Apparently the name of this planet is K-9.
So we go to warp speed, arrive home and present the Cat Faction with a fait accompli.
You idiot, I said capture their god.
Planet Dyslexia crew members discuss who has to walk the god.
There's no way they'll elect this one.
I think he wants to hump your leg again.
Yes, we have something that looks like a cat on Remulak.
Woof, woof.
Earthlings will attempt to convince you that you are their best friend but do not forget your training.
Do any of you speak Spanish?
They've evolved quite nicely since we were last here. Let's give them another million year checkup.
Don’t come back without the stick.
I told you to bring me a 'yuppie!'
I observed the planet for decades and concluded this to be the species with the most dominion over the rest.
Take us to your fire hydrant.
Its antenna seems to be wagging a message of urgency.
Apparently, God was reversed in a transporter malfunction.
When I saw him, he was towing a slave on a rope. He made the slave pick up his poop and bring it home."
He's acting as if he wants to go OUT!
I told you,'beam him up Scotty' is not what we meant.
This earthling is so much better than we expected!
Ok, whose turn is it to take him out for a walk?
Don’t take us to your leader.
I set it to find a very stable genius
Happy thanksgiving, yall.
He wants to know what level the hydrants are on.......
They told me they would send the male USPS." I don't know what that means.
He knows sit, stay, fetch, and beam me up.
Hi guys, you haven't received a memo from PETA about new teleportation program?
Fetch the “Beam Me Up” machine engineer. That’s not a Scottie.
Laika warned us some of you would be wise asses...
How did you train them to feed and walk you, pick up your discharges and still adore you?
Remember agent K9 all we need is their biscuit technology
Aren't these things supposed to come with a little plastic bag?
They seem to be very eager to please.
Humans love them so let's try it. Medium rare?
Does it think our ship is shithole?
Humans reverently follow and collect nuggets of wisdom dropped by them.
OK! Now that your safely back tell us what you learned.
Can you be our best friend, too?
Ask it if it knows a good boy.
This is going to be easier than we thought
Go forth and leave piles of waste across the globe.
He actually probed himself!
We think it's that stable genius leader they're all talking about. Our AI machines confirm this is one mean son of a bitch.
All it says is woof. What do you think that means?
Yes, I'm sure these are the ones in charge. The humans walk behind and collect their remains!
Who wants to go out for a space walk? Good boy!
Earthling, you act like you’ve lost your best friend.
Who's a good zyxtlotl?
It appears these earth-dwellers are more intelligent, loyal and adorable than we had anticipated...
This Earthly wanted to check out OUR butt
Uh Oh, I think he needs to be walked.
It's your turn to space walk him.
I'm confused. He seems so much more intelligent than the two-legged creatures who boss him around.
Hmmm, doesn't say anything, shakes his tail, appears friendly. Gentlemen, based on what we know of Earth, this must be President Trump.
He’s here to help us mark our territory.
So, one if by land and two if by sea?
As you ordered Commander, I just about to deliver my report on this Earth beast to you this morning but the beast ate it.
The tail is still. It's the craft that's wagging
I thought we were getting a Scotty.
Remember, Zlork, this process will give you 72 earth-hours to learn their weaknesses. Whoever you come across, just act like their best friend.
We can help you heal.
He needs to go out again
Great...another retriever looking for his abducted master
He came with a note: "We send you man's best friend."
So this is a bagel?
They're better looking than we thought, but not as talkative.
I don't know why they like humans either.
Whatever you do, dont send me to Korea again
Do you remember when we looked like him?
He forgot the frisbee...
Finally, a life-form in the universe that likes us.
This organism appears to have a pet that cleans up after him.
This is not the Rover we wanted
I promise I’ll take him for a space walk three times a day!
....it was easy, a little peanut butter and he'd follow me anywhere.
Obviously a superior intelligence.
We'll call him Lunar Rover.
Apparently, he mistook us for something called a "Frisbee".
Who’s turn is it to take him for a space walk?
Finally, an earthling pleased and grateful to be beamed up.
Tell us more about this "Frisbee" from your planet.
Yes, yes, of course she is a rescue.
Couldn't they have taken him out to poop before we beamed him up?
So, how do you get them to pick up your poop?
Why isn’t he their leader....he’s more intelligent?
He’ll take us to his Master. Apparently, his Leader has an attitude toward aliens.
He seems to be the only Earth creature who's excited to see us again.
Excellent disguise, Zendrx. Remember, chase felines and sniff crotches.
You like Tang?
I think this is the wrong "Scottie"
After much research we declare this the master species.
Don't be fooled by its friendly demeanor. They've managed to get the humans to cater to their every need.
We've got to learn what he knows. He's got them following him around picking up his crap.
You're sure that THIS is man's best friend?!!
I said 'God'. We need to find God!
Dammit- I said "Beam me up a Scottie"
Remember that transmission about a hound dog? Well, this is it!
I sure hope he's spaceship trained.
Mans' best friend is sending message: take me out to play NOW.
Can we keep him!? Oh Pleease!? Can we keep him!? Can we keep him!? I'll float in zero gravity with him everyday! I promise!
Stage One of our invasion plan is working perfectly. They now universally regard K9 as 'Man's Best Friend'.
You're, like, really smart.
Can we keep her?
The dyslexic Martians' search for God was doomed from the beginning.
Lets keep him and call him Spacey!
I have to go back I’m afraid. They are so stupid that they keep messing up my research.
His walker didn't make it.
Bone me up, Scotty!
He seems pretty happy for a being that eats its own poop.
Yes we can rid your planet of the two legged parasite.
Siriusly?
There was another species with it. Had only two feet, but it ran away.
Were we supposed to fetch the stick or the dog?
I think he wants to go for a walk!
We were right, a "heckin good pupper" is just a dog.
You’d think we could have designed the ship with a dog walk so we wouldn’t have to find a planet three times a day to beam him down to.
You're not Scotty.
Your leader is trapped down a well?
you're not a Scottie.
Did he just shit on the new teleporter?
Are you sure I won't be noticed in this costume?
“”Well, considering he’s from that shithole planet, he seems pretty friendly.
No, just because we are followed by two legged creatures on a tether, picking up our droppings, does NOT mean that we are the dominant species on our planet!
That's a good question, but we don't know who the good dog is, either.
Yeht llac ti 'god'
Didn't I tell you to stop letting your kids use the Tractor Beam?
I think it said there is something wrong with our roof, roof?
Good boy Zorg! Now that you've got them poop-n'-scoopin', we can begin the invasion!
Ok, but he’s your responsibility.
You beamed up Spotty not Scotty.
Send him back. I’m more or a cat person.
I know, right? It's our go-to place to get the real poop, too!
Are you sure you requested an audience with their God?
Naw, this can't be right, do it over... this time order the pizza 'without any meat toppings' .
What's that boy, Timmy has fallen down the space time vortex well?
You're not Scotty.
I believe I requested to beam me up a Scottie.
According to his humans he can not only tell us who a good dog is, he can tell us who the best dog is.
He said, "Beam me up a Scottie," right?
And don't even get me started about his tweeting.
He is the best friend the leader ever had.
I say, send him up to some shithole or else he’ll be, you know, all over this place
Tell us again, why couldn't you infiltrate the White House this time?
What do you mean, you have to go out?
What's the Lassie? Xralnach's caught in a gravity well?
They took us to their leader.
We decided to start with the most intelligent life form we could find.
Finally, we found intelligent life on earth.
Seems logical that this is the ruling species of such an infantile planet.
We can keep him only if you promise to walk him.
I thought you were going to beam me up a Scottie.
We await your orders, our Supreme Leader.
Houston, we have a problem.
Our first rescue.
That is not a Scotty.
One step for mankind . One giant step for wireless fences
You're WHOSE best friend?
We told you to beam back THE rover.
Trust me. Pluto has not run off and left you.
Should we pet it or eat it?
Do you know Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
The biped slave that was with it caters to its every need. Must be some kind of telepathic mind control.
I told you we'd find intelligent life.
Tell us more about your motivation in catching flying disks
And you said we wouldn't like humans
Where in the hell are we going to walk him
Hmm...this is somewhat confusing because his telepathic message is definitely done cryptically. His message is, "Hurry! The bag! The plastic bag!"
No, I don't have your tennis ball.
Deities. They pull humanoids on a chain behind them to clean up their divine excrement.
This is the leader. I saw the bi-peds serving him.
When a dog's gotta go. A dog's gotta go.
I thought you said "Bark side of the moon"
After monitoring your President Trump for a year we have concluded you are the only source of intelligence on your planet. Want a bone?
So, how do you keep humans thinking they're in charge?
The biped asked too many questions.
Is Timmy in trouble?
This must be the famous Mars Rover!
Geez, is it just me or does Stan look 7 years older?
He seemed friendly.
Check his collar. See what galaxy he's from.
And why are we supposed to repeatedly ask you if you are a ‘good boy?’
Be a good doggy and bring us the paper.
He only knows one word.
Our scanners show this is the most intelligent creature on the planet Earth.
At least he licked me. The other tall creatures ran away screaming!
What happened? We wanted a Scottie.
When we saw the bipeds picking up excretions we knew which species was in control.
Behold! The Mars rover!
It is said to be man's best friend.
As always, when you get home, tell no one ....
So which one of you is your group's very stable genius?
This arrived from a distant Galaxy, he responds well to the word "Fetch"
As the most intelligent life in your capital, your friendship is important to us.
Zorg, it is your turn to spacewalk the dog.
We have captured Earth's supreme ruler. No other earthling can do nothing all day, defecate where ever they want or hump someone's leg without severe ramifications.
I found this dog peeing on our particle accelerator.
Should we send them the dog now, or just see what evolves?
What a cutie-pie! WHO'S a valuable specimen? YOU'RE a valuable specimen!
And then Oprah became queen.
We can't take you for a walk but we can take you to meet our leader.
Beam him up, Spotty.
Please tell your species to stop trying to fetch our disks.
He must be the higher of the two species--he can scratch his ears with his feet!
Who's turn is it to walk him?
OK, we traveled 10 million miles in light years, but that's only 12 dog years!!
Do people really pick up your poop?
You may stand... We are not masters of the universe.
This must be their leader. It's mere presence makes you feel better.
It's just such a...such a good boy
No, we are searching for g-o-d.
Down, boy.
Close Encounters of the K-9
‘Do you think he has a chip?’
I took him for a space walk last time.
We will reach Vega in about 25 light years. For you, multiply that by 7.
If our calculations are correct, they will worship the ground you walk on, they’ll feed you every day and you’ll sleep all you want. Just keep that tail wagging and don’t let on that our takeover is in six of what they call months
I think he's telling us he wants to go out again.
We came all the way to the Dog Star only to find this?
Boss says we have to figure out why they worship this thing.
Is it... is he... a good boy?
So when it's time walk it, its' MY dog now?
Logically, they would only send the brightest into space first.
We can't get him to do anything.
Mission complete. Humans are incredibly receptive to obedience.
Trust me, he's way more fun than their actual leader.
Finally .... proof of intelligent life on Planet Earth !!
Rover 11 is cleared for launch, yes he is...
In many of their residences, he is the head of the house.
I think we found that very stable genius
Fido has to go. Can you beam him out, Scotty?
Always excited to go for a ride.
He will teach us love.
On this planet, you pick up our poop.
It appears we beamed-up the wrong Scotty!
They're friendlier but smellier than I expected.
Don't be fooled by him - they're actually earth's most cunning parasite.
" He is happy... but dumb. I think he is what they call a 'Republican'.
Ready for your spacewalk?
The mind scanner indicates receptivity to a "treat."
Hope he's not microchipped!
Ok human, please answer one wag for yes and two wags for no .
My name is Spot. I'm your new best friend.
It looks like the other ship left the probe in.
It’s Area 357 in dog years.
He appears to speak a tonal language.
Can I stay? It's a dog eat dog World out there!
I don't want to see any more poo floating around...
Teach us how to make the humans pick up our poop, too.
All it seems to do is wiggle that thing in the back, but it must be intelligent; it had a human following it and picking up it's poop, when I sucked it up here.
No, we can't open the window.
I hope she likes having her food in a saucer.
Klaatu barada nikto.
OK, OK we get it - take us to your MASTER
What is a Frisbee?
And this is the master race of planet Earth.
This is the most sentient creature we have found down there.
He has to go out again. I took him to the lunar surface last time.
I thought they were supposed to stand upright? And what the hell's with the tail?
We're listening. We know you have a tail to tell.
You said you wanted a space rover.
I bet this doesn't happen to the cat when she chases beams of light.
This will surely melt anyone’s force field.
We finally found The Good Boy.
Remember, when you get back home tell NO ONE what you saw here!
My assignment was to bring back the Earthly meaning of life. Meet "Rex."
Yep, Ted. This is the leader. The two legged specimens just walk around after them all day waiting for them to crap.
Gee, I guess all men are dogs...
We chose the best and the brightest.
You've disappointed us. You didn't turn out to be the stable genius you claimed.
You mean THIS is their best friend?
Who's Timmy and what's a river?
Best friend or not, you better start singing if you want to get back to that tree
Bill is dyslexic. I told him we are trying to determine if there is a god.
I don’t think that we can keep him.
I was transporting their Supreme Being. What? They don’t read from right to left?
Egor, you have nothing to worry about, your AKC documents are in order and your transmission chip is undectable. Just remember to lick him on demand and never chew on his cable TV remote control. As they say, good luck.
It was the smartest creature we could find in the place called DC.
I think it's some kind of sub-woofer
This is not the kind of Rover we needed.
Just pretend you're their species best friend like you did on the last planet and our conquest should go fine.
You should have seen the way his servants picked up after him.
so you're the best friend, but what is man?
We said beam me up a Scottie, not just any old mutt
Must be a leader, as other species attend to his droppings
Scotty? That looks more like a lab.
So everybody else has to hunt and gather, but you can poop on the floor and still get free meals and shelter?
he leads humans,he must be there leader
Where's your ball?
But I'm not a Scotty!!
So far, we know that he's telepathic and his leader is named Cesar Millan.
It's kind of cute and knows how to sit.Can we take it home with us?
Well, it was either him or Donald.
Beam me up as a Scottie
When they haven't seen you for awhile, they jump, waggle their whole bodies, and lick your face in delight and affection. We'll make a fortune when we get this species back on Roq.
We'll have space for him.
Oops! Scotty has been beamed up.
He followed me home - can I keep him?
At last, a species more advanced than us at anal probing.
This IS the most powerful creature on earth, sir--we saw humans picking up its poop.
Who wants to go out for the spacewalk today?
Let's ask Mom if we can keep him.
I asked for Cpt. Spock, not Cpt. Spot. I swear Siri never gets it right.
All well and good, but where in space are we going to find a tree?
What is it Lassie? Timmy’s fallen into a gravity well?
I asked the computer "Who's a good boy?" and this showed up.
What? Timmy fell down a black hole? Then there's nothing we can do.
A dog star...get serious.....
We're out of guesses. Throw us a bone. What is your purpose?
Are you sure? We were told your leader was a Golden Lad.
We want to learn how you train your master to carry your feces.
As long as it doesn't bark in the middle of the night...
Timmy's in trouble. Let's follow him to Timmy!!
There was also a cat, but he ate it.
He followed us home.
We captured his copilot, according to his bumper sticker.
All my life, I've been hunting for someone who understands me.
This is the dominant species on the planet
We have ways to make you talk.
Who beamed the dog up? (Who, who-who, who?!)
I think he likes me!
Okay fellas, let's give this rover a try.
I have easily gained the trust of the humans; it is the feline population that is proving more difficult to infiltrate.
All that moon barking is starting to get on our nerves.
Hope you're smarter than the two-legged ones.
What did you do with our report to the Fleet Commander?
Oh, you read left to right - we thought you were their god.
We've just beamed him up and he seems like my best friend.
He was attended by a two-legged, hairless servant.
He knows where the bones of the lost expedition are buries.
He's hoping we know who's a good boy.
This one has trained the humans to pick up his waste.
Oh for God's sake, not again! Put it over there with the girl scout and the potted plant.
So it is your kind that is actually the master.
Who's a good Earthling? Yes you are. Yes you are.
I said "Beam us up A Scotty." This one looks more like a Lab.
So, tell us again how our light-year is different from a dog light-year.
I don't know, it just followed me home.
"No, I said I wanted the 'Mars' Rover.
You did well with the bone. Now I need you to fetch my other clone.
Now who's a good little Earthling? Who? You!
No, YOU do the anal probe.
Finally, we've found intelligent life.
Yeah he is the one we want to talk to. The other one was being dragged behind carrying a bag full of feces.
This is what happens when you catch a Frisbee.
The ship sent us the smartest and kindest creature they have.
I guess you can teach it new tricks.
Well, you did say 'Beam me a rover.'
We are sending you to Earth to become man's best friend.
We were trying to beam up a newspaper.
Don't you see? The word god is dog spelled backwards.
No ,I'm not a MAN, I'm a man's best friend !
Maybe now she'll go on the pad.
Sparky, this is your third bathroom break in a row!
I need to go for a walk!
I think it's time for his spacewalk.
Wanna go Space Walkies?
As a member of the dominant species on earth, I welcome you.
So when they say “heel” how do you respond without letting them know you’re in charge?
I play whenever i want, have my meals brought to me and sleep 14 hours a day. and you're the intelligent ones?
There is intelligent life down there!
What does this mean,'fire hydrant?'
Mom, Dad, can we keep him?
The cat says you know where all the bones are buried.
It's the humans' only source of happiness
We think she is one of their important gods.
Let’s try this: Who is a good boy?
I'm gonna be honest. I'm having second thoughts on incinerating this planet.
Do we have to take you outside for a walk?
But how will you walk it?
Whoops, I said "Beam me up Spotty"
Draxyl! Thank goodness for that HomeAgain microchip!
As you can see, earth-beings are very friendly.
Well, they should be happy - the mission was find friends in the universe.
Look, he is already portal trained.
Gets along with others.
What's Arf? Their city?
Hello, Earthling! Please take us to your leader so we may learn from the greatest of stable geniuses.
I've always wanted to beam Scotty up
What's that? Little Timmy has fallen into a black hole?"
They seem very endearing and obedient.
What do you think woof means?
What now?
No, I did compare the two. This must be their President!
Next, beam up Dr. Dolittle.
That's not Scotty.
Their anal probes are way different from ours!
Space lab?
Sorry. All Earthlings look the same to us.
I wonder if they think I took their socks
Who is your Master and why did he send you?
Really surprised you guys speak Dog
Pretty sure they're the dominant species. You wouldn't believe what the hairless apes were picking up!
When I order a Rover for our Mars landing, this wasn't what I had in mind.
I am glad that you've mastered sit, but I'm sorry, you can't stay.
Tell us where your ship is...
What is a Mississippi Leg Hound, exactly?
I thought the signal was directed toward a receiver.
Quick, beam him down, he has to go!
We can help you age more slowly than your owner.
Max has to go out, and he's looking at you, Walt.
SORRY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TAIL WAGGLE CODE
He says that his leader has fallen down a well.
I said, 'Beam me up a Scottie!'
According to it's telepathic response, tail wagging and butt sniffing are their honorable forms of greeting.
So how is it that your kind are the masters of so many earthlings?
They're much less intelligent than we thought but also more noble.
Put your helmet on, Fred. He's pointing to you again for space walk.
I said beam up the love of my life. My wife is not going to like this.
We beamed you here in peace, Earthling. What are you called?... Speak... Speak...
All in all, much more superior to the human specimen we gathered.
"A talking dog! I wasn't expecting that," said Scotty
You can smell it, but no probing
Of course I'm sure. I said it slowly and clearly just like we practiced: 'Take me to your retriever.'
Dammit, we got the wrong Scotty.
We understand your his best friend, you can still take us to him.
All I said was, do you wanna go for a ride?
I've been fitted with a monitor, as a condition of my probation.
Earth's last intelligent life-form.
And now that our co-pilot is here we can begin.
He claims that he is their leader--that they buy him food, drinks, bathe him, scratch his back and pick up his poop.
Remember, your mission is to become their best friend.
We asked for a Scottie.
It appears the inhabitants of Earth have superior intelligence and loyalty!
Oh, you mean the humans. We couldn't communicate with them either.
We asked you to go down and bring back THE Rover.
Yes, sir. We've profiled every possible specie on this planet and found this sample to be the most humane, caring, creature we've ever encountered. Maybe we should leave this planet alone.
Tell us more about this "peanut butter."
I think it's called a land rover.
We come in fleas.
I'll take him out, but I'm not picking up after him.
We should probably name him Scotty.
I simply can't fathom his affect of optimistic expectation. After all, he lives on Earth!
Who’s a good human? You are! Yes, you are! You’re a good human!
We beamed up a Scottie and this is what we got?
The kids will love it and it doesn’t need batteries.
This must be the dominant species. The two legged ones follow behind and pick up their poop.
Bones? Where we’re going, we don’t need bones.
I'll ask you one last time "Who's a good boy?"
Did he poop?
Now go back and find the ball.
We discovered another Unidentified Furry Object.
A treat? Well it was certainly a treat for us, too.
Our intel suggested that Earthlings were aggressive, unhappy, and out of shape. We're obviously dealing with a much more sophisticated civilization.
This is going to be easy. They're so obedient. All I did was tell him to sit.
Our tests show he is the smartest creature on this planet.
Let's put it to a vote- P.E.T or Chewbarka?
I'll bet you can't wait to get out of that disguise.
I found him sniffing around outside.
But he's very good with the children.
Can I keep him?
He's not their leader but at least he's a good boy.
Take me to your leader, I sure could use a new one
Klandar, did you pack the Zarconian space wipes?
Wait till everyone back at planet Dyslexia finds out we captured the Earthling's god!
Be careful, we don't understand how they control the humans we maybe vulnerable as well.
I said, 'Beam me up a Scottie!'
This is not Doug.
You beamed him up, now you find a place to walk him...
I think I would like to keep him instead of the less friendly, bi-pedal specimen .
My planet is in need of good boys. You're our only hope, Rex, will you help us?
Do you think Mom will let us keep him?
It was dark. He's the only being we found. Why are their doorknobs so high?
Whoooooosssss an Alien Boy?? . . . . YOU are!
Is it true your country has gone to the dogs?
They must be very intelligent, they've taught their pets to wait on them hand and foot.
Still wrong, even if you did hear "Beam me up a Scottie".
That doesn't look like a Scotty.
What's the light-year to dog-year conversion again?
Scotty's must be on the sauce again!
He wants to take us to his leader.
Here kitty, kitty!
Oy vey iz mir! Di mshuge doggone transporter iz geven broken vider!
Lay Down!
Hey Alexa, beam up Spock. "Okay, I'm beaming up Spot."
It seems friendly but has such big teeth!
We need not fear the earthlings' science if this is their idea of a "Lab"
"bleep, boink, burr, Rusty! yurrr, wonk, breep, Rusty!
Fetch us some humans
How do you know he doesn't come from Trojan?
Yes, yes, we understand that you're a good boy, but what else did they tell you?
His Master's Voice--we'd better listen to it.
Who’s a good alien? Who’s a good alien?
This is a top secret mission - How did you get here?
He's getting old. This is the third time in an hour he has sat on the Transporter waiting to go out and pee.
Send it back, it's from a Shithole country.
So, we are agreed. You become our best friend, we supply unlimited treats and no neutering!
and they let it sleep in their beds!
Mess the carpet again and it's back to Earth.
So that's it. The simple secret that will solve everything. ...do you maybe wanna write this down?
If taking this shape means eating croquets and walking on a leash, let's find a planet with a different meaning of best friend
I know the sweater makes you look fat, but you have to go back.
So much for cutting-edge voice recognition. I said, "Find materials on planet K9."
I've never seen such a good boy.
This is ridiculous, how could they get along with only words for "fetch," "sit," and "stay?"
Pluto sent us.
It was extraordinary. The earthling was fearless. He attached himself to my leg and gave me a most enthusiastic greeting.
Research indicates we should tell him he's a good boy, and he'll respond by slamming his hind appendage on the floor.
Don’t mind him; he’s just mad I took away his T-Rex bone.
Are you Sirius?
Oh, Cruton, you poor dyslexic fool, this in not the great power that Earthlings worship.
Take us to your lead dog.
Klatu?
I said "Bring me a bagel"
. . . to boldly go where no dog has gone before!
I’ve been asking him to take us to his leader and he keeps giving me a small pliable spherical object.
You should have gone before we took off. Now you'll have to wait 'til we get to Mars.
Sit earthling, sit! Gooood earthling.
Not only is the species adored by our human subjects, they share our fascination with the probe site.
This one isn't talking either. We may not be able to help the humans solve this 'Good Boy' mystery...
Steve. This is not a cow. This is a dog. Try to pay better attention next time I speak.
Who's a good carbon-based lifeform? Who's a good carbon-based lifeform?
So you want to see Commander Wuuuf?
The planet inhabited by cat-video lovers is within blaster range, sir.
so this is their GOD?" "they say DOG.
The blue ribbon said Best in Show so woof has to mean something.
Supreme Leader, who’s a good boy?
Finally! Someone who understands us!
He says his name is Scotty
The Mars Rover
Your mission is to bring back the tennis ball
Unfortunately, we're from a dog eat dog world as well.
How did you train your two-legged slaves to pick up your excrement?
This must be Earth's alpha species. We witnessed a subservient life form collecting its excrement.
He’s no scotty.
Would you believe that they even sleep in bed with them?
I said "beam me up Scotty" not "beam me up Spotty"!
He doesn’t look like Chewbacca.
We found him chasing his transmitter in circles.
God DOES exist!
Laika! 60 years we've been waiting for you!
And you've trained them to pick it up for you?
Good Earthling! Now, speak!
Language translation has been quite a challenge, but he seems friendly enough.
It appears to be one of the more intelligent Earthlings.
I’m ready for my walk!
Can you guide us to Rover?
And when the food passes through your system, they pick it up!
Said the dog to the strangers, our people walk behind us and scoop our poop. We rule.
I think he needs to go for a space walk
Astro got out of his galaxy again.
I am a cartoonist and a pharmacist living in beirut lebanon and i like to draw cartoon to make people smiling
I’m guessing walkies is out of the question.
So, please tell us: How did your species manipulate the bipeds, so that they cheerfully house, feed, and exercise you?
What happened to his pet?
Wonder what 'woof woof' means?
Please explain what you mean by "number two".
Apparently, his leader is "Woof." Why he wags his hind appendage I do not know.
Remember, no table scraps.
I thought we were beaming up a Scottie.
I thought we were beaming up a Scottie.
He's hoping to hear the voice of his master.
I think I remember him being taller and a bit less hairy...
So much for "man's best friend."
See...licking your balls is a characteristic of intelligent life!
He says the way to their hearts is through licking.
Earth will never suspect a thing.
He must be their leader. They call him "King."
Sit!
Are you really his best friend?
Who's a xpizb plarg? That's right, you are!
We scrapped the search for intelligent life forms in favor of good-natured and open-minded.
Look what they've done to George. He was my best friend.
I sure hope he's housebroken!
He chased our saucer thinking it was a Frisbee.
If I promise to take him out, can we keep him?
I much prefer adoptions to abductions.
We'll learn his language on the trip back
Hmm, might this be the Scotty we always hear about?
...and then he said, without a hint of irony, ‘No, HE’S the one who rescued ME!’
It's up to you, Timmy. If you beam him then you feed and walk him.
Please, can I keep him?
Who’s a good boy?! Wanna go for a ride?!
So whose best friend is he?
He must be Royalty, for the humans fed him, bathed him, even picked up his waste.
I'm pretty sure we can get away with saying 'he's a therapy dog'.
Laika.. What's yours?
Thanks. It’s a Dog eat Dog world down there.
Canis Major or Canis Minor? Wag once for Major and twice for Minor.
Let's call hime Rover.
Apparently its willingness to negotiate our takeover of the Earth hinges on the throwing of a stick.
How old is 20,000 years divided by seven?
He thought he heard me say, "Beam me up, Doggie."
Would you like a Mars bar?
I'm amazed that we found a planet where they speak our language.
Our first alien interaction...it took days to get the hair out of the carpet
Earthlings are about as intelligent as I imagined.
Honestly, this has nothing to do with Mr. Whiskers from apartment 320.
Ironically I would have thought this is what they would look like if they came from the planet named "Pluto".
1600 hasn't seen anyone like you in some time, but you'll immediately be the smartest in the House.
You walk him." "No, you walk him." "Where? How?
We’re fascinated by the whole wolf half-brother thing, but actually it's your best friend we wanted to talk about.
It's your turn to take him for a walk.
We may have teleported the wrong leader.
He's friendlier than the two legged critters he lives with.
The other species was picking up his poop.
Sure I like him, but I'm not telling Dad you brought him home!
You promised me humans were hypoallergenic, Barry.
Captain?
Dogonit!
Using the universal translator I said "Take me to your leader." to a cat. He pointed at this guy. And snickered.
The cosmic medium has arrived!
It's like he senses that we are from Uranus.
It's your turn to walk him.
Could that be Finnish that he is speaking?
Please tell us, what is in those plastic bags you have your slaves collect for you?
He asked if there were a hydrant nearby
What's that boy? Zoltan is trapped inside a black hole?
They walk behind it and worship it's waste.
I believe he said, "Beam me up, Scotty," not, "Beam me up a Scottie."
We assume you're the dominant species on your planet since you get to lie around all day and pee anywhere you want.
I said, "Beam me up a Scotty", not a Lab.
He'll never go potty while we stand and watch.
You think you can just jump up and catch us in your teeth?
Wisely spoken. Life is rough! rough! across the known Universe.
He's a rescue. From Earth.
I don't know...he does 'look' more intelligent than the others.
Is it me, or has this world gone to the dogs?
I wonder how old he is in light-years.
On his planet, the little ones say he eats a lot of homework.
You can tell he understands everything we say! See how his tail wags?
Apparently a substance of great value is emitted from it's posterior. Humans gather it immediately.
Don't probe, just sniff
I think he needs to go outside.
Man's best friend is much cuter.
Zal-Tron will never believe he followed us home.
Who's the best little space buddy, what a good boy.
Obviously the navigational instrument is out of whack: it keeps wagging back and forth
... and if you hear them say 'neuter,' phone home. Good luck, Maximus.
I think this one will make us look less alien at Westminster
I think this species will become our best friends.
I'll take bachelor #1, but I think you guys have lost something in the translation. This isn't quite how the show works.
Why don't we use him as the logo for our Recording Communications Affiliates?
We WON'T be sending this one back.
Now what we have to learn is: is he the master or the pet?
Praise be to you oh great one!
"Greetings canine, we come in peace & we speak fluent 'dog'. Having observed your planet's supposed 'leader' for several months now, we decided to abduct you as we believe you can provide a better insight into your World than that orange beast".
I would like to introduce you all to our new Rover.
I am not sure Mom and Dad are going to believe he "just followed us home" since we used the tractor beam.
I told you, because they can.
This IS the most intelligent being from Earth planet “Washington, D.C.!
The alien seems friendly.
Why is he dragging his butt like that?
What a strange tale.
We've never beamed something so happy to see us.
Sorry, we have no Bones on this Starship.
And you sit home all day on the couch while your master goes to work?!
I vote we skip the anal probe.
I am going to follow him home.
It’s the planet’s only trustworhy interlocutor
Might you consider a new best friend?
Tell us more about this evil cat creature.
“He came with instructions to walk him outside”.
so that is how we took over the human race.
What's the big deal about 'going for a walk'?
If you want a friend on earth, get a dog.
It's a good gig. No work, food and belly scratching on demand.
Can’t you wait?
We forgot to bring newspapers
Did someone say, "Beam me up a doggie"?
Okay, this time when you go back, learn the meaning of "fetch".
You see, aliens are nude.
It's a U arf O!
Careful Carl, once his tail starts to shake and he gives you that glare - he is going to try to make you love him.
Take us to your master.
Wait! I forgot to put down the newspaper.
Okay, so, I smelled that teal colored flower on 6th street over and over again, and the next thing I knew I was here.
Zardork! Don't stand behind the skunk!
How far is that dog light years?
Who's going to walk him?
He wants us to praise him and give him treats. He's so dog-gone cute.
No, you can't go outside right now.
Don't worry - they say that his stnarkqflid is worse than his flozizgorpd.
We believe they are superior to the humans. They are always seen pulling the humans by ropes.
You sure you spelled "god" right?
He leads them by a leash, they feed, groom, and bathe him, and even clean up after him. But he won't reveal how he's enslaved them.
He seems happy to leave.
See? He follows me everywhere.
We have ways of making you talk.
So that's what god looks like?
He says wuf-wuf in German and how-how in Hebrew. But in English, he doesn't know whether to say woof-woof, arf-arf, or bow-wow.
They say l’m man’s best friend, but I’m not picky.
Take us to your Cesar.
Just kiss up to them.
We still don’t understand - how do you get them to pick up your poop?
Sounds ruff down there.
Good luck, Klatus, on your reconnaissance mission. We will be back to pick you up in three Earth months.
What's that boy?...Billy's stuck in the well?
Probably a stray.
Next question: you favourite pets, humans or cats?
It’s supposed to be beam me up Scotty. This is a Labrador
Aren't you supposed to be on a leash?
He's asking for a newspaper - there really is intelligence on earth!
This new specimen gives us pause.
So who's gonna walk me?
Thanks, but I already live with aliens.
Don’t give us “I’m the pet stuff, we see who picks up what!”
Now remember, after you do your business, bark three times and we'll beam you back up.
Maybe it’s lost
I think he says he’s from earth, but it’s only a rough translation.
If only we could train him to use the bathroom on the pad instead of real grass.
Whose turn is it to take him out?
Take me to your schnauzer.
I took this one because the two legged ones bite.
Please tell me he's saucer-broken.
Who rescued who?
Sorry Buddy, still a "no-go" on sticking your head out the window.
Don't embarrass yourself down there, Brian. They're a sophisticated species.
Just to be clear, it took us 3 light years to get here and you want to know how much that is in dog years?
Who's a good boy's leader?
If he’s their leader, the tail motions must create the tweets.
I beamed up the most highly evolved creature - the one's that look like us just walk behind him and pick up his feces.
Beamed it light years but still it wants a walk.
Based on our observations, we assumed that YOU were in charge.
Classic--whenever we jump to outer space is when he decides it's time to go outside.
This is the leader. The others followed him and picked up his waste.
No, a woofer is ... never mind.
Wow, it has it's own antenna in the back.
He doesn't seem to have an ideology.
And now we sniff his butt...
Behold, the most perfect creature on earth.
Welcome Earth leader. Please, teach us about your world.
Who’s turn is it to take him for a space walk?
We are about to drop you on the White House lawn: here are your orders!
I think he's telling us he likes it 'ruff'
Bark once for Republican or bark twice for Real World.
Boy, sounds rough.
It's either "offer weapon" or "offer treat."
Teach us your Welcoming Wag....and we'll rule the universe!
Who's going to be Supreme Intergalactic Ambassador? YOU are. Yes you are!
Is this the intelligent life you dragged us here to find?
This earthling seems not to have an IPhone -- strange, I thought they all did.
We think it's some sort of nose support system.
You're just going to have to hold it for a while...
I actually could be YOUR best friend.
I'm sure he's their leader. You should've seen what he had them doing.
He says his name is “Woof”.
Good, now make us blissfully ignorant that our leader is destroying the world.
Now--roll over.
Well, no, we don't have squirrels up here, or bacon, but we just offered you the meaning of life.
This one can't read and can be trained, but I said the one with orange hair, not orange fur.
This is a very sly creature: He lets the humans think THEY are in charge of HIM, but HE knows the truth!
There IS intelligent life on earth!
From what I observed in the park, this creature has complete control over the humans
Did the earthling happen to mention the leader's name?
We are sorry, but you have to be house trained to walk on the moon
No really, who is a good boy? Do you know?
Going out is easy, Rover, but coming back inside is way too hard.
They are shorter than I imagined, but friendlier.
We look forward to your report from Earth, Xfeftl 662, now that you have been so effectively disguised as the planet's dominant lifeform.
Who's a good boy?
Best of all, cats aren't worshipped on our planet.
Airfare is posted in bitcoins, not bites. I'm sorry for any confusion sir. would you like to be upgraded to cargo?
Why, yes, we can beam a gamma ray that would instantly render all humans infertile.
All I said was "Beam me up a Scottie." They sent me a mutt instead.
Maybe it needs to go for a space walk?
We saw your leader; we preferred you.
I long for the days when we could just let him out in the yard!
What does he mean by "best friend"?
Welcome back, Commander. Yes, we've still got some glitches in the transporter.
Yes...just what we needed - he's this year's Frisbee Champion!
We captured one of the masters that the other species serve!
In space, no one can hear you bark.
It's all fun and games until someone ends up in a cone.
Finally, some hope for intelligent life on this little planet.
Do you want to go for a nice ride, do you, huh, do you?
I told you ordering a hot dog using the drive through was a bad idea.
But is he OUR best friend?
Finally, after decades of trying, we've beamed up intelligent life.
Whose turn is it to take him for a walk?
Take me to your leasher.
This is the most intelligent life form on Earth?
The humans call him man's best friend; therefore, he can be useful.
I thought you said they did tricks.
Sir, I believe the activation command is 'Downward Dog.'
That doggone IT guy is a genius!
Looks more like a Lab than a Scottie. Who beamed him up?
Exactly how long have you been best friends??
What was an Australian Labradoodle doing in Roswell, New Mexico?
What's that boy? Your planet's been taken over by a big, dumb, orange idiot?
This creature makes that happy, thumping sound every time I tell him we’re from Yurakaboy.
Remember our old friend R-2? Meet K-9.
It’s about time Mars got a new Rover.
I read its mind: He needs to go for a walk, and he said not to forget the poop bag.
Captain Zorb, how far to the next rest area?
I thought we agreed on a dolphin.
Calm and friendly, clearly a superior species to that screaming and kicking biped we beamed up last week.
Who's bitch is this?
Yes, the scan shows this creature is the most intelligent being on planet Earth.
Friendliest creature ever found in the universe...
Somebody has to walk him.
He's asking? "Why not the cat"?
Lassie's come home!
I said DAWG, not DOG.
He seems to respond to petting, much like his President.
He got "sit", let's try "down".
Does abduction count as a rescue?
Stand back. Is that a weapon winding up?
Who’s a good alien? Who’s a good alien?
How quaint a domesticated wolf.
Maybe woof means hello.
We understand that, "you're such a gooood boy!"
Well, at least we were able to save their kindest species before they blew themselves up.
Tell me, how did you teach the humanoids to take care of all your needs?
Yes, we want to fully conquer them, but explain the part about the plastic bags again...
Who's a good boy? You's a good boy!
Didn't you hear the captain? He specifically requested a Scottie.
It seems to have a peculiar interest in our legs
I suppose you can just teleport him into someone's backyard if you run out of poop bags.
Siriusly Mr. Scott, you do not have to obey every telepathic command that comes through.
It took a while, but we finally figured out who's in charge down there.
This is their best friend?
No, no, no...the correct phrase is "beam me up a Scotty"
And who are their other best friends?
I say we make him our best friend.
I know he can sit, but can he use the vacu eliminator?
Hey, can we visit ol’ Uncle Pluto while we’re up here?
Children of earth, it's time you learned the truth about dogs.
How would you like to leave that shithole and come live with us on our planet?
Curiously, this specimen shows much greater intelligence than the stable genius.
The human was rather nasty, but Tucker's a good boy.
He only knows "Sit"
I wonder how often we have to wind it.
I tried to explain that he is 'out' .
You’re right, it does look like a dog, except its forehead is too small and it’s not wearing a jumpsuit. I mean, come on, why would anyone ever not want to be wearing a jumpsuit? Stupid tiny heads...
Earthlings...Millions of years of evolution and they still greet each other like THAT?
Explain again. If humans are the dominant species, how do you trick them into bringing you food, driving you around and picking up your poop?
Elroy, is that you?
Weren't we trying to get a sample of one of their trees?
Who beamed you up, Scotty?
I barked: You three sit! I meant NOW!
i don't think teleportation was what Neil meant when he asked us to walk Fido
Look, it's Obi Wag Kenobi!
You must be Rover.
He has tremendous communication skills and the tongue is in the back.
The humans have defeated us. How can we destroy a planet that has these?
Says he's from Sirius, traveled 7 dog light-years, and boy could I use a treat and nap!
Maybe mom will let us keep him.
I wonder if he knows the Jetsons' dog Astro.
If you want to know man, start with his best friend.
Good evening, sir. Is your pee-pad satisfactory?
He thinks he's somewhere over the rainbow.
Please excuse our imperfect command of your language.
Do you think he could be our best friend?
Those slow witted creatures you pull on a leash, are they your pets?
I'm a mutt, not a Scotty
I sure hope he's housebroken!
It's a Postmodern rhythm pattern--a little bit pastiche, a little bit kitsch.
Hello earth man. We revived your transmissions and want to welcome your kind to the galactic federation.
Whose turn is it to take him for a walk?
Just like earthlings. Instead of handling their own business, they send a friend!
You mean he's not the leader?!! He was the smartest one at their White House!
I took you to my master. Now will you give me back my bone?
Do you want to go for a talk?
I am VERY impressed by his “stay.”
God or dog? So there is dyslexic life on other planets.
He is Sirius, man.
She says her kind has gained a position of trust and that it's clearly time for the overthrow.
Are we sure that this is the only apolitical entity left on this planet?
See Spot sit.
I'm gratified to see that they were able to advance beyond "human."
But I already bought a "Beware of the Human" sign.
No, you're not in a dog frisbee.
Finally........intelligent life.
Our war against the Cat People isn't over yet.
Suggestion noted. However, "sniffing butts" is not a viable data collection technique.
No, we don't care how far you've followed us, you can't stay!
We have identified this as some sort of rover
Remember to report back daily.
Take me to your leasher.
Who’s Scotty?
He keeps talking about the outside of a tree.
Fetch me Scotty
Ok, clear. But why are they their own worst enemy?
From all of our research this is the ruler of planet Earth.
Timmy's where? In a black hole?
He’s smarter than that Trump guy they sent.
Take me to your pack leader!
Earthlings, they're cuter than I thought.
He did have a whole family of the stupid bipeds working to support him .....
It's a strange species. It's called a Gudboi.
He seems much more intelligent than what we expected.
I have a message for you from Pluto.
Ah... he followed me home!?
He is refusing to take us to his leader.
Perfect. When he's spying, they'll think he's being loyal.
Sure he's cute, but I'm more of a cat alien.
Who's a good specimen? You are! Yes you are!
Okay, who has his leash?
Go for a ride?
All he'll tell me is that his name is Ralph and he lives at the wharf.
They're not that smart, you say?
I told you...”There IS intelligent life on earth”.
But he just went. We cant go all the way back!
I say let's keep him. He doesn't look like he comes from one of those shithole planets.
What did he say? That there is no longer evidence of an evolved species on earth? Their orange pumpkin headed leader doesn't believe in anything science based, and we should just hold off the invasion as they will destroy themselves ?
I think he’s got to go out. Do we have any poop bags?
Well, we know he leads them around and they clean up after him.
Now Mork, just remember, if in doubt , wag your tail.
We landed on a big white house. He was the only intelligent life I could find.
We should've taken the one picking up the poop.
After examining their language we think it's their god.
But you're my favorite Martian
WOW ! Its actually K-9
I said "Want to go By By?" and he's the only one who came.
This Earth creature was being followed by its subsidiary species that cleans up after them. However, I figured I was mistaken when I thought the dominant species only had two legs.
Are you a visitor from the constellation Canis Majoris?
We still haven't figured out why he's sniffing our probe
Give it a spin and see if he stays on.
Yes, we have these humans completely conquered. They feed us upon command. They even follow us around, cleaning up after us.
So THAT's how you enslaved an entire species to clean up your poop!
I knew he'd always phone home
And they clean up your poop, you say?
The humans wait upon these creatures... Let us learn it's secrets.
What I said was "Beam me up a Scottie."
Your mission: Go forth and retrieve.
If I'm understanding correctly, he's asking to sniff our butts.
Then why do they pick up his poop?
Wanna go walkies?
Did he eat our lunch !
What does that mean: "Xanu's stuck in the well"?
I thought humans would at least be house-trained?
I told you to order a hot dog.
I'm afraid you're on your own now, boy. William Shatner is too heavy to be beamed down.
When I said beam up rover, I meant the Mars rover.
This one is a lot more friendly than that two-legged one.
I am really shocked, for I always assumed that when we finally made contact we would find them to be bipedal!
Take me to your leader of the pack.
I have this overwhelming urge to put his doodie in a bag....
From the looks of it, this appears to be the Master.
We wanted a Tweeter. Not a Woofer.
Although he's colored, he's wagging his tail like a Norwegian.
We have much to learn from this creature about mastering Earth's humankind.
Astro, do you want to go out for a space walk??
Hey Chewie. Who's a good wookiee? Who's a good wookiee? You are!!!
Intelligent life at last!
.....and they think WE'RE the aliens!
He is a member of the superior race catered to by Humans.
They called him a leader dog, so we took him.
OK. Now that I brought you up here, do you want to throw a ball?
I was hoping to beam up a Scottie.
I've heard their barks are worse than their bites!
hello earthling we come to destroy your planet
So.... do you have a doggy door?
You're not quite what we expected, Scotty.
Cancel the planetary destruction array! Earth still has some good boys left!
As ordered, we have replicated the Earth animals and infiltrated throughout the developed countries. Everything should go smoothly when you land, but don't say, "Squirrel."
Well, he is Norwegian.
He was chasing what he thought was a Frisbee.
I told you if we kept looking, we'd eventually find intelligent life down there.
Whenever you and the others need to communicate, signal us by lifting your legs.
It was the first to respond when we said, “Speak.”
If we collectively fulfill the requirements necessary to sustain this organism maybe our progenitors will let us keep him
Humans even pick up their excrement for them. Who did you think was in charge?
I thought he said 'beam me up a scottie.'
I told you to beam me up a Scottie
Please tell us, what is jazz?
It wasn't me! He must have done it.
Wait til your mother finds out!
Is the rumor true that on earth your master has to pick it up?
Scotty?
You think daddy'll let us keep him?
Sit!
Based on our experiments, we've concluded that he is - in fact - a Good Boy.
This is an alien. We really need to re-evaluate things.
If only she had not insisted on chewing everything.
Kibbles? Tell us more.
He wants to go where no mans-best-friend, has gone before!
We have been directed by the Intergalactic Space Council to acquire an intelligent specimen from each planet of this galaxy. For Earth, it came down to you or a species we classified as Homo trump-erectus ignoramis.
He's trying to sniff Uranus.
Behold! Earth's most intelligent lifeform.
These beings have already enslaved the Earth creatures.
I tell our navigator to find the Dog Star, and THIS is what he finds?
I thought they'd look more like us.
Its an Earthling called "K-9" but is very fond of Uranus.
I hope he's UFO broken.
I think he wants to know if we can un-fix him.
Judging by all those electronic transmissions, I didn't expect them to be so smart!
Take us to your Alpha dog.
No, it's your turn to go walk him.
Our home is one million light years from your planet. Oops, make that seven million.
He claims to be their best friend.
according to the universal translator ...he is called , GOD
What do you mean you need to go out for a walk?
Their religion seems to involve a small green ball which they instruct their servants to throw.
He seems perfectly happy to probe himself.
He seems to be some type of medical entity--perhaps a proctologist.
Can we keep him? Please, please, please!
I think we grabbed the wrong one
And remember: you're the good boy.
Man's best friend they say. Not much of a conversationalist.
Perhaps you've heard this before, but Take me to your master.
He just followed me home. Can we keep him?
"How did you teach them to obey you?'
This is their leader. It pulls the rest of them around on tethers and has them do its bidding.
We beam him down first to tell us whether they are an advanced species.
You're right, Earthlings have not evolved much. They're still on all fours.
Subject appears to be a good girl - but it's unclear what she means by "Timmy fell down the well!"
Notify Space Transporter Control that the Beagle has landed.
We have ways of making you speak, earthman.
So this is what “Beam me up, Scotty” means?
Hmmm . . . how about Rover?
I'm pretty sure this is who they call God.
We got the wrong cat
Is this what they call a 'good boy'?
He said "Beam me up, Scotty", not "Spotty"!
Remember: when we send you back, tell the others it’s time for Phase 2.
I don't know if you'd call it intelligent life, but it's clearly the planetary ruler.
Would you like us to beam up your bipedal poop collector?
Oodgay Ogday.
Oy! Anyone have a plastic bag?
He seems much more alert than the last subject who carried the communication device.
Great intell, Buddy. Keep up the act.
The earthlings obey their every command - we must learn his language!
It's just separation anxiety.
He must be very important. His servants preserve his waste in plastic baggies.
What's that, boy? You say the Captain is stuck in a black hole and needs our help?
Greetings! We pondered which was the dominant race of Earthlings, until we saw the humans picking up your excrement.
I think he said, ‘Take me to the nearest no-kill animal shelter.’
If you can make them follow you around and pick up your feces, we'll make you captain.
Earth has done it! The perfect species.
I think our leader will be please. We found the best thing Earth has to offer.
We know your great-grandmother, Laika!
careful men , his rear antenna is scanning the ship
Didn't he just go outside?
We've finally proved that dog exists!
I said bring me their GOD not their DOG.
This is our galaxy’s take on ‘Three Men and a Baby.’
Well, at least HE understands 'sit'...more than I can say for the orange-haired thing we had up here before...
He said, "Beam me up a Scottie," right?
No, it’s your turn to take the dog out for a walk.
Our first intelligent being from outer space!
You can keep him but he sleeps outside.
He's 28 in light years.
This is their leader, the one they feed, pamper, and clean up after.
The owner said drop him off any time between 10 and 4 at 73rd and Lex. Ring twice if no one answers.
Should we call you Sovereign Rex or Mister Rex and is that flexible extension an antennae?
Please tell us more about your servants--the earthlings who follow behind you and clean up after you.
He's an earth rescue.
I didn't take the inferior specimen this one was pulling by a rope.
I'm here to play the ultimate game of fetch.
What does he mean by Take Me To Your Leasher?
Subject is much cuter than anticipated.
What do you mean you have to go out to pee?
These earthlings are more advanced than we had heard. They send the two-legged creatures out to bring them food and shelter them.
I am the leader.Earth has gone to the dogs.
Bad dog!! For the last time, that is not a wee-wee pad!
The last one we abducted we advised to bark less and wag more. They seem to have taken our advice.
No need to take us to his leader. He's much smarter than him anyway.
We come in peace. Each one of our species is a good boy. A good boy!
There are no cats to chase, but you can fly and run for political office.
OK, maybe you did find the best smelling thing on earth.
Now let's see if we can teach him to scoot across the carpet.
OK Texador, I'm very pleased that you finally tricked it into getting beamed-up. But now that it's here, how shall we dispose of it's um . . .
It must be the president. It was the only intelligent life form in the White House.
No, it's YOUR turn to take her for a walk.
Go find Lassie.
No - we can't send you to Pluto anymore!
SAYS HIS NAME IS SIRIUS AND HE LIVES IN CANIS MAJOR!
So, this is the best friend?
How do you train you slaves so well?
No, sir, I don't believe that is a Scottie.
He followed me home from Jupiter.
Clearly the superior species--humans follow them everywhere, cater to their every whim, and even pick up their poop.
We have received limited information from the rectal probes. When you encounter them, what have you learned from crotch sniffing?
I’m so glad we can finally bring our dogs to work.
Who's a good alternative life form?
Here we have the only thing Donald Trump hasn't insulted on planet Earth
Hhoosaaguudboye. Hhooooosaaguuuuudboye?
I was hoping you guys could use this thing to help me find my ball
I'm translating, but I believe he's saying "rub my belly."
Our data is correct! Their women are dogs.
Take me to your lead.
So far the universal translator has proved no help.
For the last time, it's Scotty not Scooter!
Dog: "No you take me to YOUR leader."
Uh oh, I left the pooper scooper on Earth.
I feel loved for the first time.
They're much more intelligent than we realized.
He invented us as well.
I know I am orange,but I am not the President!
Not again.
He started chasing us from earth.
From what I understand, I think we've beamed up their president.
Be careful. If you get too close to him, he'll wrap himself around your leg!
Borx! Quashnard! Lerkvid! ................................... .........Biklit! .................Libcuf! .........Arfgum! .......................
I was sure after all this time that they would at least have become bipedal and developed speech beyond a woof!
I say we blame him.
Who's going to tell him Pluto's no longer a planet?
I don't think that our facilities will be able to accommodate him
If this is in fact their leader, he seems far more intelligent and friendly than intercepted transmissions might suggest.
TAKE ME TO YOUR LITTER.
I find the areas they lick themselves intriguing.
Did I hear you say......"Specimen" !!! You want a specimen.....I'll give you a specimen!
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
This was the most advanced life form we found down there.
His name is Rex. He thinks about sex a lot!
If you're going to probe me, make it fast.
Great snaggle. Now get off the frisbee.
I told you to beam me up a Scottie
I said , 'Beam me up a Scottie,' not 'Beam me up a hounddog.'
Gork ploo jwab dak.
Finally, we can prove the existence of Dog!
Do you think he is from Norway or one of those SHITHOLE countries?
Take us to your Labrador!
We did it! We captured a human!
Oh this little guy? He’s a rescue.
This isn't Scotty: this is Old Yeller.
I think he wants a space walk.
"Oh...you're in big trouble, mommy said no dogs'.
Interpreter scan says It wants to go for a walk
Canada was full.
I hear they don't call him "Sparky" for nothing...
Whooooo’s a good little specimen?
Is he pooping?!? I haven't had a face full of feces since I decided to quit my gastroenterology residency.
Do you think this one is saucer trained?
So "dog" is not a scrambled spelling
What do you mean: "Dog does not play dice with the universe?"
"All I said was 'here' and 'boy'".
What's that girl? Pfxxwqq#y is stuck in a well?
Not nearly as lifelike as Aibo...
Galactic Finance Committee: "I didn't say a moochin earthling , I said an earthling named Mnuchin."
Thanks, teleporter - now beam up a Scottie.
I just want to ride with you guys
Aw! He must have followed me here!
Sure, we can keep him, but if he sheds I'm throwing him out the airlock.
He says his name is 'Leave It'.
These earthlings are more friendly than we thought.
What's a good dog?
You help me carch the mailman and I get all the tennis balls, the rest is all yours.
Oh no! Who’s going walk the dog?
We wish to know how you can eat your own poop.
Hey boy, are you lost?
He says he can't take us to his leader, they don't have one down there.
Well, it's not exactly Chewbacca, but it's the best we can do.
Hurry, I think he's saying number two.
Allow me to translate: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Good boy! Now this time, we want you to retrieve the thing that throws the ball.
I AM G.O.D.!!!!
This isn't what I meant when I said bring me their top dog.
It must be the Mars Rover I've been reading about
I told you they had intelligent life.
It was either this, or a cat.
I know we don't usually take hitchhikers, but in this case I think we can make an exception.
Who's the best emperor? Yes you are.
He says that with just one wiff of their butt he knows more than an anal probe.
It’s not as talkative as our previous specimen, but it’s far more loyal.
Xzrrth fell down a well?
We have to beam it back. Mom says that he who flies with dogs lands with wingless bloodsucking parasitic insects.
Congratulations. You have successfully subjugated the humans.
Ask him if he is spaceship broken.
Ask him if he's Chuck Berry or Beethoven in some of those 47 languages.
Who's a good abductee? You are! Yes, you are!
Its your turn to do the probing.
Beam me up, Scottish Terrier!
I'm sure - he pooped and the lesser form of life cleaned it up.......
Send a message to home planet: "Native life forms harmless. Invasion begins."
I don't think we should try and probe this one.
We're beaming you out for a quick quick only then right back in. Ok
He says the uprights are a servant species.
What do you mean, “he wants to go out.”
Are you Sirius?
He says his species was first in space off this planet.
What is the latest report on your effort to oversee development of humans?
Again, may we humbly apologize for our dyslexic leader's wish to personally express his trust in 'dog'.
At least now we have something to herd all the cows with.
We need you to sniff out aliens.
So, commander, what are we to fetch on this mission?
OK, this is their leader. Now what?
With your head out this window, you'd die of asphyxiation...not to mention boiling blood, bloating and several other negative consequences.
Did you hear the one about the dyslexic agnostic insomniac?
The toilet water's all yours, our heads don't fit.
I need a tree badly.
Computer! Bring to us the most loved creature on this planet.
No. We got you a bunny, and remember what happened? You left it outside, and it exploded.
You're their only hope, obi.
Just be careful when you play fetch.
I think we should call it ‘alien’s best friend.’
Yo babe. you come here often? Diapers for pigeons who perch on statutes." Ufo for aliens who land on earth." "hair on the furniture." The audience controls their quarterly-earnings-announcement jitters by imagining the board of directors naked."
Down, boy.
Why aren't these boneheads feeding me?
Spot? What kind of a name is that?
Woof...woof..woof......woof? Woof.
I said beam up a believer not a retriever
He has a fixarion on the word 'Sit." Obviously, this planet's inhabitants are lazy 'Sitasses!'
Says he's got an angle on alien possession.
Where are the antennae?
Maybe the hydrant was the dominant life form.
She's an Ankylosaurus. I've found they make better pets than Testickylosaurus.
Sit! Stay! Surrender the Earth!
So we're down to either Frilthrp or Mr. Nibbles, right?
I guess they ran out of monkeys down there!
Doesn't appear frightened ... but to be fair, our species DOES smell like bacon.
Back to a better place and time. No fences, leash laws, or pooper scoopers.
It's amazing they've come as far as they have, with no opposing thumbs.
This must be their leader. Humans pick up his poop.
Don't worry Bob. You look better now than before the experiment.
They seem to have their two legged ones under their control...
Didn't you say add paws for effect?
Of course he's happy! The system prevents fleas from being beamed up!
We're pleased that the humans have served you so well.
So this is the smartest being on planet Earth?!
He looks so Sirius.
Walkies? Go walkies?
It appears you're the only intelligent life on Earth.
What exactly do you like about man?
No one's ever asked to sniff the probe before.
Does he communicate through his bark or through his tail?
What is it? And what is that thing on its back?
Loyal, loving and furry---why aren't you the dominant species?
Yes, you are a very good boy but I asked them to beam me up a Scottie.
We brought you here because you were a very good boy.
Era uoy god?
He'll be more valuable than that yellow-haired monster.
I picked him up in the Capital...says he's done with that Shithole.
He followed us home.
Siriusly, take us to your breeder.
OK, what comes after "woof"?
Please take us to your leader.
This one must be in charge. It chooses its words so carefully!
Oh shoot.
He doesn't have the best words--but he's loyal.
So this is what their species calls their 'best friend.' Let's pull out and head to Alpha Centauri.
There's no way he can be our copilot.
Could he be our best friend?
He says he needs to go outside for a few minutes.
Wow. A real human being.
He came from Pluto.
What are you looking at? Didn't you Martians ever see a dog before?
I thought he said 'beam me up a scottie.'
To get this straight, Timmy was so uncoordinated that he fell into a well, and you need our help?
I said intelligent life, bring back a cat.
Why are we taking all these pets from shithole planets?
What happened to the cartoon with the animal biting the caveman’s leg?
Take us to your Alpha dog.
It's thinking, 'When do I get the anal probe?'
Surely there is another way to let him do his business.
I summoned The Creator. Must have been my dyslexia.
Earth dog, take us to your breeder.
We need to know why their poop is so valuable that Earthlings save it.
this is the most intelligent form of life we found
Mom, I said I wanted a cat!
Well he seems to be a lot happier about that anal probe than our last subject.
"Good boy, do you need a space walk?'
We do not understand how to bring 'Go Fetch' to a conclusion.
WELL GUYS, DO WE FEED IT OR EAT IT?
Maybe he'll help us unlock the secret of growing hair.
This one's a lot smarter than the two legged ones we've encountered.
Is this one ship-broken?
'Ah yes, it is just how we pictured it. A human being."
He's, like, really smart.
I don't have a dog-gone idea what to do with him.
You don't have to beam him down, but you're cleaning up if he poops in the saucer.
They seem friendly.
Can we keep him? I promise to walk him every parsec...
Since you lack testicles, how do you reproduce?
We're not completely sure, but we think he was a jazz percussionist on Earth.
I am told that this is man's best friend and it tastes like chicken.
We haven't been quite able to decipher his language, but he came from the land mass they call "America," and is clealry more highly intelligent than its leader.
Apparently, I should have said "DiMaggio"
Oops, let’s hope the owner’s address is on the collar.
It can sit, but it can't stay.
So these humans...they pick up your poop without you even asking them?
If you are really man's best friend then why do they feed you dog food?
We're in trouble. He needs to go out.
It followed us into the ship...Should we keep it?
So the alpha dog of the US is now a baboon?
What is a fireplug?
It was the only thing worth taking there.
It seems intelligent and quite devoted but the tail wiggle has me worried.
We shall call him: "Einstein."
Hey, whoever you are, call me Laika
This is progress. The last one scratched the chairs and wouldn't sit.
You think we can get him to roll over.
What does it want?" "Spaceballs.
On the count of three, beam him up Scotty.
Shall we keep him?
Take us to your owner.
He truly is the good boy
Sorry....Who knew they weren't the higher life form.
Take us to your lead dog.
I think he wants to go outside
...And so we shall spare this planet. Clearly its beings are a tremendously loving race who desire only play and exploration of the smellable universe.
Do we eat him or pet him?
. . . And you’ll be happy to hear we zapped that creature who enslaved you into oblivion.
He says he wants to go walkies.
OK, so when we get there get down on all fours and they will think you are the new boutique breed and then will be the wiser!
What does the tail wagging "out or else" mean?
They look more primitive, nevertheless more tender of what we had assumed.
He seems to be so much more intelligent than the two legged subjects we beamed up from planet
You wanted to meet the highest form of life from down there....well here it is!! And it's a very good boy!!
Of COURSE it's the leader. The tall ones feed it, come when summoned and follow it around picking up its waste.
My sensors say that we smell like bacon to it.
The language is primitive, but this alien creature is evidently demanding a consumable reward in return for catching a giant Frisbee.
Our sources claim that political negotiations are nearly impossible without containing vast quantities of the substance it produces.
I am dog... I mean, god.
The dog ate my homeworld.
Proof that there is intelligent life on earth!
Dog. God spelled backwards.
Take me from our leader.
Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet the ambassador from Pluto.
Well, if he wasn't at the top of the species hierarchy, humans wouldn't gather up his poop!
Take us to Labrador.
Aw, can we keep him?
Finally. I was the center of attention.
It took him 1 light year to travel here. That's 7 light years for you or me!
Can we keep the lab specimen?
So this is the new Space Rover?
How'd you like a new best friend?
The tag says Pluto.
The only word in our language he seems to understand is "sit."
I don't know about this first contact, but he looks friendly.
you know, I never would have thought you'd have dog days in space.
Finally after all these millennia, I prove to you that intelligent life DOES exist on earth!
But, Captain, he's a service dog!
They assured us, he'll be the next president of the US, but asked us, to train him first in bad language
Clearly a more intelligent species. The last one did nothing but scream.
Bone me up, Scotty!
Sure, he's cute, but I thought those geniuses at NASA would have figured out that we're partial to cats!
I COULD take you to my leader but believe me he doesn't cotton to new immigrants.
There were two hooked together, but this one was the leader.
It is earthling's best friend.
.GOD a s’ti kniht I
I distinctly commanded "beam up the scottie". Send this one back and get me Trump.
This is man's best friend. He can't talk, he shits in the street and he smells. Makes you wonder doesn't it?
It is a UFO- unidentified fetching object.
I said beam me up a Scotty. That's a Retriever!
anybody wanna draw straws to see who walking the dog
But is he OUR best friend?
Well! Earth people seem to be friendlier and more intelligent than we thought.
I said,'Take me to your leader.' The other one had the leash. I don't know.
I think their leader sent his best friend
Clearly the most advanced of our earthling specimens
The aliens surmised that earth creatures have 3 primary interests: eating, playing and pooping.
So this is the smartest creature on this planet?" "Yes, they've got them all fooled
Who wants to be beamed up? Does Spotty want to be beamed up?
I was kind of expecting a Scottish Terrior
"I'm not sure this one is the Mars Rover." ["Mars" is in italics.]
Unless you can find a pooper-scooper on this spaceship, I suggest you send this one back.
You don't look like the Scottie I knew.
Of all the Earthlings we saw, this one seemed to be the smartest.
It refused to stay.
I could only beam up his best friend.
I tried going to their leader first, but this seemed like a better choice.
Sir, your people are far friendlier and more agreeable than we were led to belive about your planet.
Our universal language translator relays the earthling inexplicably desires to lick us silly. Hmm....
I am looking at my pet project
yeH, ti dootsrednu "tiS"!
He seems to understand “walk”.
This, my friends, is an example of the only species worthy of saving from that planet.
Do any of you speak "woof?"
We concluded it is the leader because its servants follow it and clean-up after it.
They call it, "Man's best friend"
So the reports are true. This planet has gone to the dogs.
He says they have resources but lack our common scents.
So this is the most intelligent being now on planet Earth.
Forget annihilation, I’m moving there.
So, dog looks like their master?
They claim to be the dominant species but we note that they are the ones following you around with plastic bags to pick up your excrement.
Are you from a shithole?
He always said he wanted to be a dog in his next life.
He travels in the cargo area if he can't afford a seat!
Are you SURE you set coordinates for "Pluto"?
The "sit" and "stay" commands may become problematic when we leave the artificial gravity chamber.
he came from Planet K-9
He has to go outside to go to the bathroom
No more licking our enemies - got it?
It's saying it wants to go outside.
If they want a friend, their leaders get one of these.
Aw, can keep this earthling?
'Much friendlier than the two-legged creature.
This proves it's a Dog-Eat-Dog universe out there.
We could beam him up, but I don't think he's a scottie.
Dinner "if," I mean "when" you get back.
Clearly the dominant species. They get the bipeds to do waste control.
Captain. We only have enough power to energize the transporter one more time.
He didn’t want to leave the cabinet, actually.
He already looks like a leader.
We must stop his tail from moving. The last time this happened he released a dangerous brown substance with toxic fumes.
I don't care who implanted the chip. This is not the congressional candidate for Florida.
Hello, Laika.
Take us to your breedeer.
The Snamuh will panic, now that we've captured their Dog!
He can sit, roll over and fetch! I told you there was intelligent life on planet earth.
You know, I think with the proper breeding, we have found our new supreme leader.
Strangely I already regard him as my best friend.
Dog Gone
Once we beam you down, see what you can sniff out.
We didn’t know when we said “Take Me To Your Leader”, you would bring us the Top Dog”.
I brought you here because you are the three smartest of your race.
Greetings, Mister President
So on earth the humans feed you, clean up after you, bathe you, brush your hair and let you pull them around with a leash?
Playing fetch outside is a BAD idea!
Maybe we shouldn't blow up Earth after all.
HE SEEMS QUITE PERCEPTIVE
Dinner is served!
Well let me tell you, his bark is even worse.
If I can keep him, I promise to run his probe every day.
No need to worry, I’m housebroken.
Marklar, we have an adorable problem.
It anticipates our next show of alien dogs.
Huh. I thought they'd be taller.
You can keep him as long as you are willing to find a suitable planet and take him out three times a day.
We can’t send him back because now he is Zarnod’s service animal.
Looks like we forgot the Scoop A Poop.
Take us to the top dog.
Go and rid the world of cats!
We travel 50 million light years, and all you can bring back from there is a bone?
We would kindly like to ask you for a few of your human slaves.
Puppy want to go for a moonwalk?
You get the pooper scooper. You were the one who used the w-a-l-k word.
"Hey Scotty, are you going to beam me up or just stand there staring at me?" Joe Pitts, Washington, DC
He really seems to like you, WOK
He followed us back. Can we keep him?
So your so-called masters were actually of an inferior species?
Hey, wait...You're not a Scottie.
QUICKLY! Alert Nasal Intelligence!
Your name "Snoopy is a dead giveaway!" We know you're here to hack our technology.
So, there is intelligent life on earth afterall!
Research shows that this is their god. Hey, did you ever fix the spellcheck on the computer?
Tell us more, Master, about the one you call Your Bitch.
After a millennia search, future scientists finally discover indisputable proof of Dog.
We can't get him to stop sniffing the anal probe long enough to learn his language.
I don't recall the Earth inhabitants being this friendly on our last visit.
They haven't mastered fans yet.
So far we’ve figured out their alphabet goes from arf to woof.
Please let me keep her, I promise, I will spacewalk her every day
What a relief, there is intelligent life on this planet.
Unassuming in appearence, yes, but somehow his kind has enslaved the whole of the human race.
ride?... wanna ride?...wanna go for a ride?
Feed these Earthlings a biscuit and they think you're God.
You know what they say -- a dog is a Zorg's best friend.
Tell us more about your evil master…
He says "I am so happy, there is intelligent life in the universe, after all".
Earthlings will go ape when they hear we've captured their best friend!
This must be their leader. I observed a life form following him around with a pooper scooper.
Our universal translator is having difficulty decoding "kibblekibblekibble".
No cats on our planet!
Yes, Master!
Through mind melds we're learning his language. Pretty primitive stuff like 'treat', 'ball' and 'sit'. But we haven't been able to decipher 'whosagoofuzzeebubbeeboy'.
He needs to go for a walk. I'm betting we didn't bring a pooper scooper.
Now that you know everything from me, can you turn me back into a human?
He looks lost, should we check his tag?
He was the only one leaping in the air and greeting us when we flew low over the park.
He will teach us to sniff where once we probed.
We're leaving earth now, back to you cleaning up after yourself.
We decided to leave his animal on the other end of the leash.
We'll tell mom he followed us home!
I'm sure I said "Beam me up a Scotty."
Can't we keep it?
There will be no peace until we meet its demands.
I think he is from one of earth's shithole countries.
They call this a "good boy."
Wow, an earthling with two more legs.
Maybe they're not idiots... they were smart enough to send their most evolved species.
Is it worth going back to Zablonk with the Westminster runner-up?
We're concerned-are you housebroken?
Can we keep him! Can we keep him!
I'm not sure how important this is to their culture, but people keep picking up its poop.
He's a lot smarter than the others.
It's OK. We bark, too.
This is the supreme being from the planet Earth! In addition, much nicer than the humans that also inhabit that bizarre place.
World Domination Phase 2 ready at your command, Your Canineness.
He's got to be the leader. Any time he went out, someone followed to clean up his poop.
Now, we're letting you out at the next rock, boy, but don't worry, we'll come back for you.
Why do you look so different?
These mounds you are leaving behind, is this how you disseminate your wisdom?
This year's Best in Show competition is literally out of this world.
It doesn't look like a Scottie!
He's cute, but taking him for walks will be tricky.
I can't understand anything he says. Seems friendly
I said we are in the YEAR of the dog, not in NEED of dog....
I call him Mars Rover Jr.
What means "house training?'
Who wants to go for a spacewalk?
Don't worry. Back home no one will know it's a dog.
It says it wants to be our best friend.
Behold! The creature that probes using only it's nose!
Energize! We don't want him crapping on the bridge again.
"i thought we ordered a pizza".
I said a leader, not a pointer.
We thought it more important to capture a master than a pet.
Did anyone bring any plastic bags?
"Beam me up, Scottie" must mean something else in this subsection.
How's an astrodog supposed to drag his behind in a place like this?
You’re unchipped, right?
He claims to be Pluto but I think he’s Canis
Intelligent Life, I see.
Next time we'll abduct his best friend.
Thanks guys! You saved me from our leader! Do you have space for 2.9 million more?
You will assume the role of the President's dog. Now, please remember which one of you is barking mad.
What do you mean he hasn't had his shots?!
President Trump wants you to leave and return to where you came from.
Funny, they don't look a thing like us.
So which one of you is Scottie?
He had a rough trip.
He's so cute. Let's get one of those two-legged Earthlings to probe instead.
Five planets this month and it’s always the same. We’ve been beaten again, gentlemen.
I told you we should have gotten here before 2020
Rover, let’s review. You fetch the President’s nice red button, and we’ll bring you back up. Drop the button right here, and then we’ll take you to see all the squirrels.
This'll be just like taking your temperature at the vet.
Do you lift your leg too?
Who could ever suspect a face like that?
What’s domesticated?
How do you get the humans to clean up after you go to the bathroom? Do you hypnotize them with your tails?
When we beam you back you must tell them we come in peace
Where's you god now Earth?
We've translated the barking, but we don't know what it means. He's saying "Walkies.
His language is advanced.
This must be the universal language on earth.
I am Woof, He is Grrrr. For whom do you wish to communicate with?
I think it's morse code for I want to go out for a walk
Who's turn is it to walk him?
Happens every time we're in Canis Major.
It's your turn to take him for a walk.
Takes us to your Vet !
gentlemen, please, the correct nomenclature – and, again, I say this only for the purposes of science – is botch
He'll be fine as long as he doesn't stick his head out the window.
I saw him in the window and I just had to have him.
The bipeds were preserving its waste. It must be their leader!
Study it carefully. This species has humans providing it food and worshipping its droppings.
One of the more interesting species we have found. As a sign of their dominance, they train apes to carry their feces around in small bags.
A perfect specimen of how to train humans: First he sits. Then they give him food.
There is no heaven. Tell your people.
Welcome to the dog days of abduction.
It looks friendly. Do you think we can breed with this new species?
Whew, that's better... remember that time Zark beamed up a lion?
He wants us to take to T’Bonz!
The internal microchip means they are superior to humans.
Okay Elon, your bone is buried somewhere under L.A. Go find it, boy!
I think he needs to go to the bathroom.
Different; but finally a planet with a friendly, intelligent species.
Certainly the friendliest species on the planet.
Finally, a sign of intelligence from Earth.
I thought we were transporting the dominant species only. I guess we'll have to exchange those frozen pizzas for Milkbones.
Weirdest planet yet... strange inhabitants speak a primitive language. Central command cannot decipher 'bow wow' and 'bark bark' and has ordered us to return to base with another specimen.
Watch this! 'Who's a good little Earthling? Oh, who's a good little Earthling?'
Unbelievable. He stays even when molecularized for travel.
There's nothing here to wag about
We rescued him from the K-9 system.
Beam me up Sparky
Dog? Dog, dog! Dog dog dog dogdogdogdogodgodgoddgodgodgodgodgodgodgdog!
I'm sorry but "Space, the Fido Frontier" just makes no sense.
Our long mission is over. We finally found the Good Boy we've been looking for.
Run the word "woof" thru the intergalactic translator, but I'm telling you know, I don't like the sound of it.
What else can they do besides pick up your poop?
There's a bipedal species that these guys have trained as slaves! The bipeds WASH them. They FEED them. They even clean up their excrement!
Take me to my leader
How does a species of your spirit, wisdom, and intelligence put up with those ghastly earthlings, anyway?
I am your leader now and it’s your turn to get neutered.
Thank God it's canine. The primates on that other planet were assholes.
You idiot! I told you to teleport Trog.
This is “ the most intelligent life”? He doesn’t even have opposable thumbs?
No! I said, wean my pup while I go potty, not, beam me up Scotty!
I'm not taking him out!
He wants something called a "dog biscuit".
Oh my! Xandor's in the well?
"From what I have observed from the earthlings - the reason why this animal is so popular it wags its tail instead of its tongue"...
At least he not a tribble.
This species was featured prominently in their leader's tweets.
Followed me home. Can we keep her?
Try another planet. This one's gone to the dogs.
This is the Frisbee's revenge.
Shall we bow down or just bow wow?
According to our computers, this is the highest form of intelligence detected around 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
But why would they pick up his poop if he wasn't a superior life form?
Excellent! Our copilot has arrived.
It must be a higher level being. Its blood alcohol level is zero.
How in the universe did you get them to pick up your poop?
But the cat said you wanted to leave with us.
Just an FYI from past experience - if it raises it’s hind leg...run.
Are you sure he has influence on Earth? " "Yes, it's got over 1 million followers.
We came as soon as we got your message, Lassie.
Did he just say he wants to flea?
Definitely the dominant species. You should see his servant hurrying to pick up his poop!
He does that every time I mention a treaty
We hear you're their best friend. What can you tell us?
Hmmmm. So earthlings are more intelligent than we thought.
Can you introduce us to Brian Griffin?
He says he's God but he might also be dyslexic.
Whatever this 'butt' he's asking about is, it's the key to everything.
It was the only intelligent animal left on that planet.
It can't be a dog. All the dogs we've seen drink and tell jokes.
bark twice if you want to defect.
As soon as we get home, I promise I’ll take you for a long walk.
We found him on that sh*thole planet
Hey it worked - we beamed up a Scottie!
Now we have mutual friends.
Cabin scanners detect methane with trace amounts of sulphur. XYGLPH, was that you?
Actually, we were hoping you'd fetch us some of that good new Beaujolais.
I am sure that he's the superior being. The other one follows hime wherever he goes, picks up his waste, and then keeps it in a special bag!
I should have been more specific when I asked you to bring back a king.
Well, we were seeking intelligent life on earth,
This earthling beamed up is wondrously friendly. But how in the world did they build those space rockets we've seen?
This is the species that leads humans by a leash, whose droppings the humans collect, and who is called, "Man's best friend." Our quest for intelligent life is done.
Beam him up already, he's got to pee!
I'm doing a mind meld sir, and it appears he is enquiring if we have any bones.
Beam him up, Spotty.
Can't give you my serial #. It's embedded and encrypted.
I come in peace. My name is ‘Fido’ Jetson. I am a direct descendent of ‘Astro’ Jetson. I’m here as a beneficiary of my great-great-great-great-great granddog, ‘Astro’ Jetson, named as the benefactor to dig up a bone he buried some 50 years ago.
You are em-barking on a new adventure!
Dog. God spelled backwards.
Tell us, how do you control so many to do your bidding?
Which shithole country are you from?
He says he's originally from Canus Major.
Should we send him bark in time?
"Who's a good krnslgxkb?'
That was G-O-D, not D-O-G, earthling! Can't you follow a simple command?
This is their best friend?
He says he wants to be rescued from his sh*thole country
Teach us what a 'walk' is, and then we'll see.
You're communicating "outside". Oh.
It's a cute souvenir, alright, but do you think it's worth the journey?
It must be Earth's ruler. It eats feces then licks the faces of humanoids.
No doubt an example of earth's top life form.
He followed an astronaut home and got lost in space.
Our first rescue dog. He was barking up the wrong tree!
Finally, proof of intelligent life.
The humans call it a Good Boy.
I fear it wants to go outside.
So be friendly, but don't make conversation.
Beam him back to the blue planet, he won't be happy here till the back window is rolled down.
Speak!...Speak!
Ugh. I'm pretty sure we're all out of plastic bags
I’m not sure what it is, but I think I’m allergic to it.
Speak!...Speak!
What happened to Jim?!
Don’t worry, Mars already has one Rover.
I told you they wouldn`t look like us
She forgot to bring my slippers.
He’s much nicer than the last earthling we picked up.
You left the pooper scooper on the other ship?
Do you have fleas?
It only appears that I am the leader because they pick up my poop.
We teleported the happiest subject on Earth.
Tell us how you made the humans your willing servants.
It was the most intelligent life we could find.
What do you mean, it followed you up the transporter beam?
Finally intelligent signs of life on Earth!
Really, he followed me home.
Apparently, it's name is "Woof" and it defends itself with a foul smelling liquid.
No evidence of resistance confirmed. Beam him down.
Sorry, but we have a strict non-interference policy.
I communicated that we lost sight of Pluto.
I'm confused...now is this the dog, or the dawg?
We observed the humanoids carrying his excrement, making him the dominant species.
I’m here to tell you about down below.
Zork, you must remember at all times your good boy cover identity.
Riley to Scottie...beam me up
Finally, proof of evolution.
He says his species is served by an order of malodorous bipeds who exist to shelter, feed, bathe, entertain, and clean up after his kind.
Ha, save your energy, earthling! I assure you, thanks to our superior signal scrambling technology, your continued attempts to reposition your posterior antenna to receive a transmission will continue to be futile!
I wonder why he wants us to land on the neighbor's lawn.
I swear you said 'Beam me a pup'.
Its some type of code.
He's thinking about a stick. What's a stick?
Wow - they’re so sweet! Our fantasies of them as cruel power hungry beings were all in our imaginations!
STAY. Dog gone it, you can't go where I go.
"Let's see if he can be spaceman's best friend".
We’ve brought you here because your kind is obviously in charge of Planet Earth.
The good news is our Rover’s finally here.
Is it me, or do they all look alike?
Can we go out and play fetch?
So we’re agreed - we send these little guys down first to soften them up, then in 15,000 years we strike!
Scott, I swear I heard you say, "Beam me up a doggy."
I can only afford to keep one of you.
OK, we know his bark is worse than his bite. What else do we know?
Well it was a choice between the wife and the dog, and I'm very fond of the dog.
" Take me to your breeder" is all he keeps saying!
Take me to your pack leader!
Shall we call it a god, a odg, a ogd?
Great, now we have a dog in this hunt!
He must be the top dog. We saw him walking those two-footed creatures.
Don't move out of that circle. We have no pooper-scoopers on board.
I thought I told you to get the Mars Rover!
I thought I told you to beam me a Scottie
He makes sense to me. Let's turn around and go home.
I'm just a dog, not my fault
We can all be friends but I can only have 1 master.
They can't talk; but they're cuddly and less troublesome.
Maybe there are stable geniuses down there.
Is that you Kirk?
Is this Scotty?
The sign said " Leader Dog ".
Unfortunately, there won't be help with attachment issues for thousands of years.
So you didn't fetch the ball, then.
He says he wants to go out.
Trump doesn't want a dog. We need a Plan B.
Your job, Bark, is to return to earth and lick humanity. It's a dirty job.
Moon Doggie?
I wag. Therefore, I am.
The dominant species of earth. Other beings pickup their fecal matter!
Who forgot the pooper scooper?
Why are your foreheads so big?
How did you get them to pick up your poop?
He seems to understand our language.
"Best friend" apparently means submissive adoration.
A close encounter of the furred kind.
It first licks its butt, then it licks people in the mouth and the people laugh and hug. It has to be some chemical because I can't imagine any other species in the entire universe that doing that.
He is a member of the planet's ruling caste.
What happened to Scottie?
Don't just stand there - feed me!
Aliens: After observing earth for millennia, we have deemed you the superior species. Dog: We really just stayed for the bacon.
No we’re not naming him Pluto.
Dog-Gone-It
From what I understand, he says that this planet highly prizes loyalty.
This is surely the dominant species. But abducting the two-legged specimens allowed for a richer conversation
What did we do to deserve you?
Is this Doge?
Enough of the"Who's a good boy......Who's a good boy!!!"
He says they've got a lot of them domesticated now.
What are you? Where are you from? Do you come in peace?
It will be hard for him to learn our language.
Mom says it's your turn to walk the dog
It's a low-tech humanoid thing. They send a canine to sniff out strangers.
I'm the top dog despite what Trump may tweet!
They seem to have evolved.
All right. But don't expect me to be cleaning up after him.
Roughly translated, we’re not welcome here because we come from a shit hole of a planet.
He must be in charge; we saw the being next to him bending to pick up his poop
Pilot episode for "Lost and Spayed".
It helps keep track of how many steps I take
I beamed him up to find bed-bugs.
He wants to go outside.
We thought it wanted to come in, when it lifted it's back arm.
You said you wanted Beethoven.
What shithole are you guys from?
But enough about me. How was the show?
Yes I am in total control of these earthlings, so much that I have them pick up my poop with their hands, whenever I go.
The land isn't flowing with milk and honey, but this creature is its most redeeming feature.
He's your dog. you take him out.
Yes, he!s dumb as a brick, but so friendly.
He followed me home. Can I probe him?
We can’t handle unconditional love.
Supreme Galaxy Commander...can we keep him?
Of course we have many questions for you, but first, we would like to know “ Whose a good boy?”
Take me to your wisperer.
Congratulations Commander Arf! You really trained them well.
It's a green and blue ball. Go, fetch!
What do your servants do with your feces?
'No, I said anybody's best friend!'
Want to go space walkies?
I was expecting a scottie
It seemed quite interested in licking its probe-hole. Clearly a more advanced species than those we've had thus far.
Who's a good being?
They say some humans have no tails.
You did it again. Forgot to beam up Sherman.
One sniff and I knew we were meant for each other.
He says he will help us conquer the planet if we de-neuter him.
We've developed a highly sophisticated and very accurate bark-decrypting device and we've been monitoring you for a while now. We know that you're the GOP puppetmaster!
Gentlemen, our research is nearly complete. Soon we will finally know who's a good boy.
If the TV signal was correct, his name is Brian -- but he only talks to Stewie.
This is the best subject so far.
We only use Bitecoin! Why won’t you believe me?
I don't know, their president does need a friend, but this thing just seems a little too intelligent.
. . . to boldly go where no dog has gone before!
If my theory is correct, we'll get far more information from the best friend.
We wish to know you taught them to shelter, feed, and clean up after you, and they don’t even speak your language.
He wants us to open a window.
We powered up all warp accelerators, just couldn't outrun him hightailing us out the lot.
Do you suppose everyone on this planet talks like that?
Any idea where we can find a patch of grass?
This must be the new probing tool from Earth.
I heard they taste like chicken.
Sorry, no dogs allowed.
“How can we be sure it’s their leader”?
Let's go guys! It's time to go out.
It's not Pluto.
"He says, 'Give me a treat and I'll take you to my leader'".
Can I keep him?
The rumor is that they are needy.
Set a course for where? Are you Sirius?
He said “Beam me up Scottie” not “Beam me up a doggie.”
You have been aptly re-named and we're on the way, Pluto.
So we can understand where you're coming from you must utter that first 'Woof,' 'Arf,'or 'Bow-Wow.'
Wuff, wuff. Get data analytics here now!
Well, the people with him said he was the "best dog ever".
So they're always happy but haven't even invented the wheel yet?
He just met us and he loves us.
3.14159...
This service dog claims he can guide the master vessel
Enough already with the tail-wagging - kvetch !
Isn't it"Beam me up Scottie', not "Beam ScottieUp'?
I know what he answers to. Are you sure it's the right Trump?
I agree. She's a very good test subject. Yes you is! Yes she is!
he's fat enough to be president trump. but that cannot be -- he's a pig.
This is what showed up when I said, "Beam me up, Scotty!"
Better beam up a human to handle his excrement.
The real reason dogs bark int he middle of the nighe
Dogs are the ruling class on Planet Earth. Human slaves actually scoop up their poop.
They've trained humans to feed them, bathe them, take them out on regular scheduled walks. Even to housebreak them. Sounds like a superior life form to me.
Just don't say W-A-L-K!
Understand it won't be easy to be recognized as the alien's best friend.
They’re a lot smarter than we thought
Besides feeding you, petting you and taking you for walks, you actually got your human to pick up your poop. Good work.
Yes, your majesty, we'll be at the SPCA to free your wife within the hour.
The Earthlings no longer recognize you so we're taking you home Pluto.
Dog is God backwards. You got the wrong deity.
Their Master’s Noise
Hello, we're your best friend's enemies.
Are we still friends?
I just think he really, really needs to go out.
It doesn't seem very impressed by our technology. Must be an advanced life form.
Amazon really does delivery everywhere these days..
When I said I wanted a petite blonde companion this isn't what I had in mind.
It sounds like the creature is saying “ Astro “
No, Fido, shooting in the hole is neither conceptual art nor political protest!
Walkies!
Should we take him for a space walk?
Congratulations! You have the most views of any creature in the galaxy.
Will you have a bitch for me?
If that is a human, he's his own best friend.
And what shithole planet are you guys from?
Trust me--He's going to make abductions unnecessary.
We may have been wrong in thinking he was their leader.
Don’t send me down there in this silly disguise and only a one bow wow vocabulary
The little one with the whiskers was too quick, but we think we got the vice-president
#~**_# /~~# WOOF
I forgot his official vest, but he really is my emotional support dog!
It seems to communicate through its tail
This looks like a lab. I asked them to beam me up a Scottie.
Is this the space shithole?
You seem a lot smarter and less outspoken than that creature we brought up from that big white house.
We’re pangender, so please keep that in mind when considering a best friend.
Someone needs to space walk him?
Just once I want to beam you up, Spottie.
We are ready to take off, Captain.
He has a life expectancy of 10 years, so we must leave now.
This human looks a little "ruff" around the edges.
Well, they appear to be a friendly race.
I am Rex, the top dog on this planet. I'm sure we'll get along well. My needs are simple: regular meals and two walks every day.
I asked him to sit, but I think he wants something.
Her name is Sildar. She and her kind are researching Earth.
He certainly looks Presidential.
Who is a good boy! Who is a good boy!
Zork, do you want to meet his excretory requirements?
Is this a dog or a god?
Hopefully it's potty trained.
I like him. He seems much more reasonable than the last earthlings we picked.
It controls humans with that twitchy thing!
And who's the best boy in the whole Universe? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. There's a good boy!
"I walked her last time".
Does this mean we have to file an accident report?
Very funny, Scotty... Beam me another pup, and I promise I'll send you where no man has gone before!
So do you think he wants to play go fetch with the disc?
Came for the cats; leaving with the dog.
We said to beam up Scotty, not Spotty.
How could you guys get this wrong? All you had to do was enter three letters! This is definitely NOT a deity.
Can I sleep in your bed?
Our captain thanks you for the generous gift you left on the flight deck.
Do you think we should just re-program its brain and make it their new leader?
"We're training him to 'hold it' until we're over the capital.
Yes, we know you're Earth's highest life form, and yes, you may have a biscuit
You see Zorg, it’s take us to your LEADER, not breeder!
What exactly is this fire hydrant that you keep desperately referring to?
...and I'm taking this Rover to search for Spot.
Is there no conditional love to be found in this universe?
Hey Astro! Want to see Pluto?
Somehow it seems to know that we're from Planet Woof.
No, for the last time, I cannot convert "light years" into "dog years."
On my, was it just to be light hors d'oeuvres?
This is the first earthling I have seen eager for an anal probe.
It's the dominant species of the planet.
On the Internet, we didn't know you were a dog.
Would Trump call him dark or white meat?
It loves potato chips, has small paws, shits everywhere...let’s call it Trump.
He wants to know if we’ve seen Pluto.
'We wanted the fire hydrant, not this?!
Interesting communicator appendage...
Fetch your leader
The humans have their best hidden in obscurity. Unlike the leader of the free world, when he lifts his leg he doesn’t say a word.
He looks, like, really smart!
I've trained him to go on the portal. How genius is that?
No wonder they're so far behind. They're still walking on four feet.
I'm available, if you guys like pets back home.
I'm looking for a better class of friend.
I need to show him that he is not the Alpha Centauri male.
I'll be, Earth has a stable genius.
I think we need a translator.
He jumped up and grabbed the ship while we hovering, and wouldn't let go.
We can work around the moving appendage.
We beamed up the wrong Rufus Taylor.
...and they pick up your poop? Tell us more about these humans who work for you.
Well, he's no less unintelligible, and he doesn't seem perplexed.
Until then the aliens had always ridiculed humans for unnecessary inventions like the doggie bag.
She said she doesn't know who left the dogs out.
Captain, apparently, we've encountered a rescue-dog planet. This one's such a cutie. Can we adapt him? Oh, please?!
Among my people, I am worshiped like a DOG
Again? We just took you out at Proxima Centauri.
Do you think he needs to go out?
You are to sniff around for evidence of collusion with us.
I'm a dog, stupid...
He seems to be happy that I can read his mind. But all he's thinking is "chicken poop".
At least he can sniff out our destination.
Though artificially produced, it’s a perfect model. If we can decode its syntax and massage it correctly, it should give us the answer the most pervasive question in all the ancient texts thus far deciphered!
Beam me down and I will show you where I hide my bones
He seems to like our frisbee
I'll have to recalibrate. It was supposed to be a cat.
We have been studying your planet and we will be grooming you to become the next President of the USA!
We have a ruff situation.
If you don’t speak they’re going to love you.
The creature he was walking ran away on two legs.
To serve man is a dog?
He heard you say take me to your feeder, not leader!
Why yes, I am Earth’s dominant life form; and we have many unintelligent pets called “humans”
Sorry, all the cats are still in breath awareness class.
Stop him before he disarms us all!
"Fear not...the inhabitants of Planet Dyslexia will consider you a god".
Yes, very friendly. Might be a nice companion.
Woof , right back at you earth being !
Wonder if he could be "our" best friend.
I met their leader. This is better; trust me.
The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs.
We're babysitting him for the Pentagon.
Sorry, we weren't looking for the Rex-Files.
Does anyone have small plastic bags?
A thorough cellular scan has identified him as entirely useless, but amazingly cute.
Uh oh - he says they have no leader.
These aren't Cone Heads! Beam me back, Scottie!
Now where are we supposed to walk him for the next 10 light-years?
Who would have thought they could advance to this level of intelligence!
As far as technology, this is the human's rover.
Vaporize him, Wham-o. That’ll teach him to play fetch with your ship!
How are we supposed to interrogate this specimen when that damned antenna keeps moving?
Get a dog, they said. It’ll be fun, they said. So why is it always me that has to spacewalk the dog?!
Its language seems to be based on movements of its posterior antenna.
As we know alien life is quite common in the universe, although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth, with the exception of this species.
I'm going to allow you to perform the probe on this one...
Set your phasers to 'Good boy.'
I think its Earth name is "Sit."
"Master"! "Fido"!
He's so much better behaved than the two-legged creatures.
On Jupralara, we're your best friend.
What I can't figure out is how he put on the collar.
Humans don’t look quite like I expected.
No, Siri - I asked for a heterodyne receiver, not a golden retriever.
"Are you saying you do like humans?'
Universal translator says "Happy!"
I can’t take my it anymore. He barks anytime anything comes within 500 light years.
They love these things, but I just don't get it.
This type is more intelligent than the bipeds.
Trust me, I'm a member of the species you want to deal with.
There is intelligent life down there!
God a s’tI .siht pihsrow yehT
Not sure if I should do a mind meld or just sniff his butt.
He's from Hollywood, so he'll be comfortable among he stars
Captain's Log Stardate 2120: The Tribbles are back. They've evolved.
We're sending the Earthling home because he keeps probing our backsides.
Our experts think it's an antenna...
He is called Rex. He and his kind rule the planet Earth.
I believe the rear appendage might be his vibrating microwave antenna
Clearly our evolutionary experiments worked here, but failed miserably on the bipeds.
She needs a spacewalk.
Guess Seinfeld was right...
Are we sure we need another walkies?
He's cute as h*ck. 12/10 would take him back to their planet.
Can you just beam up my poop?
I wanted the blind man.
After what we saw your walking partner picking up behind you we figured that you are the superior being.
You forgot your ball again, didn't you?
Guys, want to see something totally weird? "Roll over"
Are you Sirius, a ride to Canis Major?!?
You're telling me the leader is the guy with the bag of poop?
Klaatu barada nikto! Sit?
O.K., We've done sit and transport. Now let's work on heel.
He likes us! He really likes us!
Our Princess, Laika, needs a playmate.
I think he wants to give us a gift.
Th computer beamed up the most intelligent life on this planet
Hey! We finally got their leader!
But what are the tiny plastic bags for?
I said Spock, not Spot.
So this is really their ‘Leader’?
NO! THE BONE ONLY COMES AFTER YOU CLIMB IN!
Looks like our planet going to the dogs.
Welcome to your new home in the galaxy ken l ration.
I wonder why it keeps saying 'WUFO, WUFO'?
Who wants a space walk?!
His language is too advanced for our translator.
Look, it's the dominant species!
Oh, great! Whose turn was it to walk him before we left!?
Unusual creature, this breed.....But until we run further tests it will be difficult to determine if we evolved from him or him from us.
Get out the brandy. Apparently it wants a snifter.
Be careful, he manipulates the earthlings to get everything he wants!
Aw, can keep this earthling?
We're not sure about the level of intelligent life on this planet, but they test off the charts for loyalty.
I told you I wasn't just here for Christmas!
Well, he's smarter and non-racist.
He looks friendly.
Pat it on the head and see what happens.
Do you think that wagging part is it speaks?
It's called an "ankle bracelet."
Scotty, you much friendlier now!
I think it's a high-memory earthling. A terra-byter, they said.
It may be the President they all talk about. Our AI dictionary is sure this is a son of a bitch.
He says he's Red Rover.
your purpose here is completed, now go back to Earth!
Yes, unlike at home, here you get to keep your miles.
It's a pooch.
What do you call those creatures that clean up after you?
This one appears wiser and better behaved than their President.
So, where's the dog park?
Do you think he's a Russian spy?
It's called attachment hunting
All righty, then. Who's walking him?
No more exploring, Rover. Now fetch an Earthing.
He says he'll take us to his leader, but fears we'll be very disappointed.
No - I said “beam me up A scottie…”
So, how far is that in dog lightyears?
They are indeed quite advanced. The additional wagging limb communication device is attached to their bodies.
I can’t believe they really sent you an emotional support animal, Bob.
"Best Friend", do they direct ship that collar?
I hope he’s potty trained.
It's the only species on the planet that can do that.
Permission to set course for the Sirius system, Captain?
Take us to your master.
But if we keep feeding him he'll never leave.
Get outa here, we're from the Dog Star!
Captain Kirk, Beam the Scotti Up!
Show us this “doggy style”.
They appear friendly, we should be fine!
He thinks he learned a new trick—beam him back.
See how the earthling's aerial vibrates when we speak.
But I specifically asked him to beam to beam me up a Scottie.
I said Spock, not Spot.
I think he's asking for another spacewalk.
We thought they'd look a bit more like us.
Go on, You're pulling my leg!!!
He says that if we rub his belly, he'll tell us everything!
...Oh, its called a 'tail'...no, I cant really control it...
What part of "Roll Over" don't you understand?
Who is gonna kiss me first?
God, is that really you?
We should name him Scotty and give him a job.
Did you remember to include the area code on the collar?
I’m amazed that you speak our language—but can you say anything beyond ‘Let me out…stranger danger.’
he came from Planet K-9
And a WOOF back atcha
Me beam Scottie up
Maybe there's a number on his tags
???? ??µF? ? ????? “Good boy” !
Log book 2018 beamed SPOCKS, dog on board ,SMELLS like a alien fart.
He's our last hope to get through to Vader.
Who’s a good earthling?
Yer ka Zuarus, I think it wants a little space doodad thingy!
Yes Major Tom, he has fantastic ground control
Good first try. Now let's go fetch the ball back.
It looks smarter than the last tall biped we beamed up from Earth, you know, the one with the orange hair.
Let's name him Scotty.
Eisenhower triplets: Who would have believed it? Woof!
My button is bigger than yours, and I'm sitting on it.
Remember when you take him for a walk that moon has a poop & scoop by-law
Earthlings seem friendly but the crotch-smelling greeting is a bit strange.
One thing we can establish about this creature, he certainly enjoys getting his belly probed.
Now, Fido, I know you're excited about being off leash for the first time...
How can you call yourself a working dog if you don't have a job?
Not you again! Woof.
He seems to be tapping out some kind of message.
Who's a good interstellar traveler? Who's a good interstellar traveler?
Hope he does better with our electric fence than the last one
I would stay away from that tail if I were you -- It looks like it is getting ready to fire !
Can you hold it, Boy? Just about another 5k miles to the next android rest stop.
Nice neckline.
Do you think he'll retrieve our morning papers?
Who's a good specimen?
Well, it's DNA certainly matches that sample we found by the travel path.
This guy really beat us to the punch on the probing!
Tell Clive to get in here right now.
I present to you the Dog, the most intelligent earthling.
You said abduct their best friend
We forgot to beam up the poop bag.
Can I keep Him? Please! Please!
Your kind on earth have to pick up all we leave behind.
The Earth dog thinks it's a wee-wee pad.
What year is it?
Don't worry , I was told he's house trained.
Take us to your leader... Oh, wait, it's written on his collar.
As best as I can translate, the life-form yearns to be a good boy.
I thought you said, “bone home.”
We hope you can lead us to your best friend.
You beamed up the wrong Scottie.
I heard he was a mans best friend.
Let's hope he's not a publicity hound.
Remember millennia ago when we had tails? An genetalia?
We're studying plant life on earth, not animal life. I said clover not rover!
She needs to go outside>
I meant take us to the LABORATORY Scotty. C’mon!
Nope, it's still snowing outside!
Tell us more about your excrement pickers
So this is Scotty
Sorry commander, the bone we buried on that planet is gone
What's a Laika?
He says he is man's best friend.
Don't worry, he's friendly
What is it fella?" "What, Timmy's fallen in the reactor shaft?
This is just like that time my testicles disappeared.
According to our brain size scanner this creature is just as big of a genius as the leader of the United States...it was just a lot easier to lure him into our ship.
Mork, you will have to go back for the tennis ball
Guess we missed the lesson on "Leave it"!
Let's hope this is better than the monkey they sent last time.
Short straw has to scoop the poop
Jeez, I'm not taking him out in this weather.
Does the tail waggle mean "yes" or "no"?
Maybe we should look for his best friend.
'Ah yes, it is just how we pictured it. A human being."
He wants to go outside again?
Out of waste bags? Go to Red Alert!
It's your turn to take him out.
I told them he's my emotional support earthling.
I'm in the market for a new best friend.
Infiltrate their society. If you're successful, we can always send more.
Sorry, milk bones are a terrestial product.
His probe-swatting appendage is problematic.
I believe it means he wishes to do some extra-vehicular activity.
They'll grow back but the next time we experiment on a dog, we should wear pants.
We set the protocol to abduct the best of humanity.
He looks like excess baggage to me.
They didn't tell me I was going to get three therapy primates!
Alright fellas, let's snoop around.
The humans still think we are loyal to them. Ha, ha, ha!
I'm sure he must be their leader. Why else would the other Earthlings stoop low and pick up his poo?
What do you mean you want one of to come with you with some plastic bags?
We suspected that earthlings would be docile, but this is incomprehensible.
Our leader is a Rottweiler in Massachusetts. You really don't want me to take you.
I'm your best friend too.
The earthlings are such good boys.
...and this one’s called a labradORDABLE, isn’t that right?!
I hope he has a chip so we can take him to his leaders.
At least he's not HUMPING, your leg.
This is not God...it's a dog!
Who's a good boy? Take us to your leader.
Why did I have to eat those brownies? I have to sleep this off. we
It must be a mutation of the other earthly creatures.
...and it'll do anything for bacon.
Beam me a aboard Scotty not Golden Retriever.
How did you train them? They put food and water at your feet, massage you regularly, and pick up after you outside.
They've evolved farther than we thought.
He would be perfect for our crop circle agenda.
On my home world I own you.
So are we unanimous on the name Fido?
Oh no, they've domesticated Xurthan
I just don't understand it. He keeps telepathically relaying to me that this is the biggest "Frisbee" he has ever seen.
Yeah...but we don't get why he's your best friend.
Can you recommend a species that will pick up poop?
They think they’re the smart ones.
So... who's going to spacewalk it?
I’m fine but where’s my squeaky toy?
I come from Orion
Well, this proves that earthlings are adorable and obedient.
I distinctly heard him say, "Beam me up," not "Beam my pup."
I thought you were supposed to get one of Earth's politicians I thought this was one I read that they were all lap dogs
It's called "an undecided voter."
The fifth appendage definitely indicates friendship, I say give it a chance
Look, I know you want to go back out again, but we've already beamed you up and down three times in the last five minutes.
I guess there is intelligent life on Earth.
Finally, we got an intelligent one!
Are you ready to make them believe they're likable?
They seem very obedient and eager to please but how do they text with those paws?
See..."Wanna go for a ride?" is an intergalactic expression!
He's called Pluto.
Do they really eat their own in this "dog eat dog" world?
Marv, charge up the transporter again and see if you can set it for "dog walker."
To answer your question, I'm a good boy. But you're still not probing that.
Told you, it's the year of the dog in the Milky Way.
We’ve got to have a talk with our analyst.
Either earthlings worship strange gods or we have dyslexic on board.
This entity is an source of free streaming music
No, there is no limit on how many humans we can own. They make good companions, protectors and simple to house break.
Your transformation is complete. We're sending you back to the White House now.
We've decided to get you a couch.
I thought he was supposed to bring the newspaper...
So, the term "man's best friend" was figurative?
I think it needs to go out.
Great idea! I've always wanted to visit the Dog Star.
He has some rather peculiar personal hygiene habits
Don't worry, we'll find a home for him. There's a quiet space-farm at the end of the galaxy that I think he'll love.
Can we name him Spock?
Who wants to see Spot disintegrate?
So how many dog years does this make him?
Do you think he'll follow us at Warp Factor 9?
Looks like Scotty wanted a friend.
No, I clearly said "Obtain samples FROM the lab"...
Ok, you can keep it. But it's your responsibility!
He thought it was a Frisbee.
Hey there fella, where did you come from?
I feel a curious reluctance to dissect it.
These earthlings seem rather hairy!
The algorithm will include "take me to your leader" even if it isn't the best caption.
Beam me up, Scottie!
Is he house trained?
I wonder if it's saucer-trained.
Who said Rex meant "king" in their language?
The casting sessions for the new series of Star Trek had reached a new level of desperation.
Wait, what? You're telling us you are not an indifferent, lazy species that uses your claws to destroy earthling furniture?
Take me with you - I have to get away from Trump - I'm not a purebred.
Not exactly what I had in mind when I gave the order to locate the Dog Star.
We'll have him tell them that he is mans best friend.. they'll never believe him, not a chance!.. but then before they know it- they'll adore him..he'll get all their info; all their secrets!
XJar7, this is not what I meant by "Beam one up for our lab experiments"
Yes it's cute and all but we simply don't have room for another stray.
Good boy--now stay and howl when you see the moon.
He refuses to confess.
Well, he seemed to be the most intelligent species down there.
What do you mean by, "Take me to your litter"?
No, no, no. I said, 'Beam me up a scottie.'
You were just doggedly determined to get up here, weren't you?
So you're looking for Laika?
Yes Rover. It's a wee wee pad.
We wonder why do you chase your tail ?
Wait......this isn’t the Obama’s dog!
He's asking if we can drop him near Sirius.
So how long will this trip take in dog years???
We assess so far that this species from planet earth communicates in a loud and brazen manner, but it expresses it's political opinion clearly with it's tail.
I think we bought the wrong size dog bowl
Can you be our best friend, too?
You’ve been named best in galaxy.
Clearly, a superior being!
So the "Beam me up, Scottie" setting is different from the "Beam me up, Scotty" one. Who knew?
This one's species is far more advanced than the two legged, furless one we beamed up yesterday.
Cat problem solved!
No, see, it only LOOKS like I'm leading. We call it "Going for a walk." And that collecting business with the baggies, I have no idea what that's about.
Mr. Edison, we presume.
Do you think it's civilization is so advanced that they uses, "arf" for all ideas and thoughts?
Finally, someone who speaks our language!
Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump 2h 'How do I keep getting dog shit in my hair?!'
In the Arrivals Room aboard the USS Farmupstate.
We'll beam you up, Spottie!
And now, for my second act
Welcome back, Flerb. What data have you collected from the butts today?
Alexa, I said LUNAR rover!
It's a lot closer in dog-light-years.
Is that a Scotty?
We beamed up the one who had a servant picking up his poop. And people asked him to speak So, he's the boss?
No, this isn't the Way-Back Machine, but we can stop at the Galactic Park if you'd like.
Finally, someone who speaks our language!
Hoping, this isn't a doggy eat dog world!
Let's put something in his butt and see what happens.
Can I keep her? She was just floating around space with no owner!
Some how he always phones his way back home
Are you the good dog?
That was some long ride! Which of you guys are gonna walk me? Sirius-ly, better hurry!!!
Permission to sniff your crotch, sir?
We understand you are the highest life form on Earth.
Can’t hear speech that wags. Please thump.
Sit, beam down, good boy!
Their Leader was busy playing golf, so they sent someone with equivalent intelligence
And you’ll have to promise to feed him and take him out for a walk twice a day.
My mother never let me a dog...
I feel bad about destroying Earth, but it warms my heart to give this sweet boy a new Forever Home.
It was their best example of intelligent life.
It’s clearly the planet’s dominant species. You wouldn’t believe how they’ve domesticated the monkeys!
I thought we agreed to a gold fish.
Like Charles de Gaulle, the better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs.
Zartrax the Untoward will be pleased, it's so cuuuuute!
We think you'll love your new backyard.
I'm telling you, make this puppy an Instagram page and the resistance will be powerless to stop us.
But I asked you guys to beam me up Spotty.
I told you to go abduct a human, not go fetch a hound!
See this is what happens when you don't enunciate - "beam me aboard" becomes "beam me a dog."
Oh. I thought you said, "Beam me up 'a' Scottie."
Want to co-pilot?
She looks like a saturndoodle to me.
" I smell shit".
If this is man's best friend, humans are pretty dumb
...and not only that, he pledges allegiance to Emperor Bark!!!
Ooohh, can we keep him? Pleeeeeeeaase?
And the best part is: he probes himself.
Since it found us, I guess we can keep it.
Looks like the American space dog was "hacked" again.
Can we take him home?
I hope we have a supply of doggie bags.
Now let's beam up the Scottie.
Go for a walk? This will be harder than playing fetch.
Why does everyone want to take my temperature?!?
Don't sweat it. He has to look better than us on the other side !
We did ask for the friendliest living creature on Earth.
Bob, set the transporter to 'neuter', heh heh, where gonads have gone before.
Good cushion! Can someone let me out to "go"?
It keeps responding to the word “Democrat.”
Was that tall biped you were walking your pet?
I knew there was intelligent life on earth.
He seems to want to go out again.
'WOOF' is just my acronym for Wolf Originated Obligatory Fetcher.
His name is Rex! He is their leader!
He may not be a genius, but he's stable.
When I went on the Martian dating service, I guess best friend shouldn’t have been my #1 choice.
Did you remember the peanut butter?
You're making it really hard for us to be taken seriously
They are served by intelligent beings. Perhaps they are considered household deities.
You guys wanna bone or somethin'?
He says that, in fact, the world belongs to him.
I know you’re not a “Scottie”, but ‘Beam me up, Labrador’ doesn’t have the same effect.
I think he likes me!
Supposedly he's the best friend.
Remember to fetch your leader, not the stick.
This is the creature they call 'man's best friend'. Initially we thought it to be smarter than that!
He wants to go out.
Very interesting! And you say they have hands like ours?
I forget, do we accept pets?
So this is what human beings look like?
Welcome, and how'd you know my name was Ralph?
Welcome aboard, Captain Good Boy.
Dinner's ready!
Is its bark worse than its gloob?
At last, we've captured their leader!
We wish to use you to sniff out shithole countries.
It worked. He no longer has any fleas.
After much searching, they agreed, intelligent life was finally found.
Uhhh...take me to your master?
Wow, these Americans are brighter than their leader had led us to believe!
Ever hear of the Trojan Horse?
Are you sure you asked for prove of love and happiness on earth ?
Prepare to administer the table scraps.
Yes, we know the doggy door is closed.
It trained the human to pick up the poop.
Are you the fosters or my forever family?
I think he'd like to be our best friend.
Finally a friendly alien!
And this life form was leading one of our outdated micro-cerebral clones around...
Excuse me, I'm pretty sure I said beam me up a hot dog
In outer space, nobody knows what a dog is.
You best move on to another planet. If you stay here it'll be a real dog's life.
....... And after all that, we end up with only his best friend?
We'll introduce this species and see if they stop fighting.
It seems to be more intelligent than those two-legged creatures he was living with.
Per human observation, you must step in the dog's shit for good luck.
Wanna go for a space walk?
We can put him with the chimps!
If he goes, we won't have to pick up poop anymore.
At last- intelligent life.
What? You lost your best friend to climate change?
I said beam me up SCOTTY
What luck! It's the Master's voice.
How did you train them to be so obedient?
We bark your language.
So what's the big deal? I peed on your lawn.
Apparently, his mission is to sniff where no dog has ever sniffed before.
No anal probe for this one-- just a sniff.
Let's ship him to the collector.
Leg ride? Sounds fun!
Get ready for the farthest game of fetch in the galaxy!
Guys, if you put protein in the front end, we get bacteria out of the back end that makes great saucer fuel.
Their leaders said they would send the most stable genius.
Strange as it is, many human families have one physically abnormal member who looks like this one. Must be some generic translocation during gestation.
Agent X213, what have they done to your nether region?
This is the most intelligent life form we found in the place that governs the country.
The most competent white house staff in 2018.
So this is the smartest thing down there?
Well, I say he looks like a Xernanian's best friend!
He will teach us how Man will clean up our messes.
Take me to your treater.
You three are funny looking and don't have tails. Better to let me descend first.
Man's best friend, my hat--he loves us aliens too!
DON'T JUST STAND THERE, I HAVE TO GO #1 AND #2
Day of the dog, month of the dog, or year of the dog?
We are looking for a friend are you interested?
Remember, when you get to Earth your name will be Donald Trump
Look, the alien is moving its poorly installed antenna, searching for the signal!
It appears that we won't need the laser walkers on this planet, just a handful of bacon treats.
According to the Universal Translator, "Woof" means "Woof".
I don"t think this is the right Scottie.
I told you kids that you would have to walk her -- and the puppies she will soon have.
I said, "Beam me up a Scotty. This is a retriever!"
At least he's happy to see us.
Okay Bud, do your business and then we'll beam you back up.
It's their latest Mars Rover.
We took him out last time. It's your turn.
They even pick up our poop!
Help us understand the phrase "bite me"!
You guys got food?
For some reason, he responds to their President's speeches.
Only small pets are allowed in-flight, but we’ll make an exception since we annihilated your planet.
Who's turn is it to spacewalk him?
Appears to be having activity in it's happy antenna region.....
This is the circle of inclusion.
Good sit, now lie down.
We want to be a rock group called Three Dog Night. You're the dog
This one is the smartest Earthling, yet!
So those are humanity's weaknesses. Bark and Roofs.
My name is HAL, not Fido, and you will do as I say.
It's your turn to take him out Geoffrey. Just make sure you keep a firm hand on the leash this time. Poor Skippy still hasn't come home after he went chasing that asteroid.
I still say we could have developed a better idea to gather wood samples from Earth.
Looks smarter than the dingbats we brought up before.
OK - so how do we get it to play dead?
Thought you might need a friend..
Why does it want to press its body repeatedly against my leg?
Amazing species that has trained superior intellects to even clean up its faeces.
He’ll be here in a nanosecond, he went back the poo bag.
Lock the doggie door.
Purina Alpo? Beneful Originals or Incredibites? Beneful Grain Free or Healthy Weight? Or Beef and Chicken Rachel Ray leftovers?
We believe he is trying to tell us he is “like, really smart” and a “very stable genius.”
You have been identified as the highest form of intelligence on earth.
This must be what humanoids call a ‘god’.
You're a celebrity who loves to make clothes.We'll call it `Why sew Sirius?'
He doesn't seem to be fooled when we hide the ball instead of throwing it.
Next stop, the Dog Star
But his name tag read, ‘Homo Sapiens.’
Based on the audio transmissions from the planet, I expected something less intelligent.
Please tell me again what this is, as I couldn't find any K-9 life forms from earth listed in our data base.
Clearly, it's been with us before.
So please tell us; why do they like cats?
Okay okay - please tell me his partner will be there when we arrive.
I sense its power and I want to clean up its excrement.
Ziem Natcha "Woof"?
So inform us about this 'unconditional love' thing.
Do you really have a gentle Leader?
Scotty, when we beamed him down he was a chihuahua!
Go and deposit our message on their lawns.
Of course I buried the evidence.
I warned against probing too far into our future but would you listen to me? Noooo!
Siri thought you barked “beam me up Scotty.”
Are we sure he's from Norway?
Remarkably intelligent for an earth creature!
What’s that girl? Timmy has fallen is the Hydrotron 2700 again?
In space, no one can hear you bark.
Maybe he'll become an alien's best friend?
This planet has obviously gone to the dogs !
This one appears to already have a probe.
It seems to be some type of super-intelligent mammal.
No you ought to talk to Fido over on 52nd. He's Way smarter than the one my humans are calling, "Mr. President."
We believe this is their leader.
Do you guys have a wee wee pad?
Gad Zukes Mogogoob! finally a earthling that speaks our language!
Can we keep it? Do you think it is UFO trained?
He's mentally telling me he wants to stick his head out the window.
Oh! I thought you said, "Beam him up, Spotty."
First we get him a reality show, then we will have our Manchurian candidate run for the office of the President of the United States of America
And to think, we almost abandoned any hope of finding intelligent life.
I just eat the food. I don't ask any questions.
Ok, Take us to your Woof.
Now beam up the fire hydrant.
Can I keep him? I swear to the whole universe he'll be my responsibility.
Bring us to your owner.
And when you get down there, remember, you're the superior species.
Finally, a sign of intelligent life from that sad planet.
His tag says Pavlov's Lab.
What puzzles me is the constant back and forth motion of the buttocks sensor.
"Howard, I think the dog wants to go out." Dear New Yorker folk. The above caption is stolen from an Arnie Levin cartoon that you ran years ago.
You are so lucky my tail is wagging.
Don't you just hate it when you can't speak the language?
So this is what earthlings look like !
The earthling was OK with shaking hands but seems agitated to a cavity probe.
Remember, they like it when you sniff their pants.
We're millions of miles from home, we could use a best friend!
You mean they actually follow you around and pick it up!?
He must command, the movement of his rear appendage compels, food, medication, housing, obsequious rituals and dropping pick-up and removal.
How on Earth did you get them to pick that up?
I repeat, take me to your fire hydrant.
...I am the Leader
The analysis has come in. We can confirm that you are, in fact, a very good boy.
It wants us to throw a ball,feed it,rub it's belly, or take it back.
According to our brain scans, his kind is "a good boi" and they want to love us very much.
He seems unassuming but, judging from the doting homage that he receives from the earthlings, he must be their king.
We're about to find out what going through a wormhole does to actual worms.
Take me to your leader of the pack.
Meet my new best friend.
this is what comes when you beam down a stick ?
Oh Please! Don't give us that "he followed me home" routine again.
Make sure the subject refers to you a "rescue", so you know that you've landed with someone that will be sympathetic to our impending arrival.
I said 'Beam up the Scotty!'
TAKE ME TO YOUR LITTER.
You seem to have a way with these Earthlings, Whosagoodboy.
He just says woof, woof when I ask him to speak.
Definitely an advanced species with that all purpose signaler.
But we just beamed you out five minutes ago!
He says his name is 'Rex' and he doesn't know anyone called Canis Major.
He just followed me home.
I'm going to call him Mars Rover.
We hear you have them well-trained.
Who let the dog in...?!
Have you domesticated them yet?
I told you two to 'get SERIOUS' you idiots!
Don't look at me "Wondering what am I" the Questions is ? what are you Funny men looking at?" run to a mirror" and figure it out ?
Let me guess. Pluto?
I think we found their secret Lab.
The Russians want their dog back.
Beam me down. Not a Scotty.
The way I think about it is, HE abducted ME.
Our evaluations indicate that the four legged specimen is more morally advanced and more intelligent than two legged specimen.
I don't know what breed. We abducted him from an animal rescue.
So, what do we get in exchange for vaporizing all the cats?
This is the only good thing you could find on the planet?
I guess it depends on how really bad he needs to go.
Yes, outer space is exciting. But tell us, is it true that dogs rule on Planet Earth?
Dog is my co-pilot.
Lead me to your taker
His superior intelligence is obvious—he wants to stick his head out the window.
Captain, Captain: is that you? What happened?
Guys he's cute, but I don't think this is Brad Pitt.
What'd ya say boy? Prezak fell in a black hole?
... and then I do this when they say the word 'Sit!
Now the earthlings will never suspect that it is us doing the anal probes.
If he bites we'll give him plenty of space.
Beam Scotty up, Scotty!
Come on Rover go find Mars.
I think he has spaceworms.
Wow! These humans get uglier every time we come here.
I am very sirius; he'd be better off on the dog star.
I hope he's housebroken....
Told you I smelled ‘up dog’ in here.
His adoption fees were how much?
Alexa, Gold retrieval. Gold retrieval!
Yes, but do we really need a "best friend"?
how did my mother-inn-law get here?
Klaatu Barada Nik-Knack Paddywhack
I think that means he wants to go outside.
So your those high pitched sounds I've been hearing....
Forgetaboutit, I'm already a clone !
We’ll call him Scotty
How will I find a bitch in the new place?
Who's rough? Babe Ruth? What about the roof? His language appears to be quite advanced
This is our most advanced technology, it is paperless.
I thought you said he was Best In Show?
It sure seems friendly!
Well, who did who did you think would beam up from the Dog Star?
I know, I know but I promise I'll take him on spacewalks.
Clearly more evolved than we had believed!
You guys flip a coin - I took him out for his walk yesterday.
‘Pluto needs you!”
I think we can conclude the Earthling leaders aren't the ones in front.
Man's best friend? No. My best friend!
I said “Beam me up Scotty!” not “Beam me up a Scottie!”
Whose turn is it to take him for space walkies?
Speak.
I think Scotty's transporter went a bit wrong
Does anyone know the secret handshake?
Do we still have to pick up after him?
Greetings, Earth pet. Bark twice if you are house broken.
You're right; he's very cute. Let's eat him?
He seems to respond to one word, "food".
You see? The end wags when I call it "master." I think we've found one of their leaders.
Our new propulsion system is working! Now, everyone keep telling him he's a good boy, and we'll be home in no time.
It's working backwards. I asked for GOD.
Don't we usually beam up a scottie?
We also need love, Earth people are selfish
In my experience, they spend most of their time going on walks and playing fetch.
Really? Best friend?
Take us to Astro, the Jetson's dog.
. . w???????????´???´??o?_?????_??????o?¸??????^~???¯¨?f????????~???¨`???w?¸????????¨´`?¯~¨´???ó?????????¯¨´???o????????????^??????f???????????????????? . .
Highly developed senses, loyal, loving, non-judgmental...it's the most advanced life form we found on the planet.
It looked different on eBay.
Astro?
He's been like that since we got back from the walk.
So, are you ready for your undercover mission on earth? If yes, please wag your tail.
You don't think he's from one of those shithole countries do you?
We rescued him from the Earthlings.
If this their top dog we have nothing to worry about.
The canines have trained humans to obey their every wish.
Entropy takes care of cleanups.
We got the four-legged ancestors too. Speak of yourself!
Fine, we can keep him. But I am not going to be the one walking him every day.
The "Good boy" species is worshiped by the humans.
Your mission is complete - what have you learned?
We understand you are a Leader, Dog.
Is it space ship trained...
The most advance life form who lives amoung them...Good Boy!
Am I right that this is much different than their Mars rover?
Great costumes. They'll never suspect that dogs are the superior beings.
Yes, I know we were sent to spy on them. But they have become our best friend. And they love the fetch game.
It’s friendly and will obey your every command.
He’s tapping a message: ‘I could be your best friend’.
We beamed him up with his human and returned the human.
Okay, forget about taking me to your leader--can you do the rolling over thing again?
The abdogtion of ambassador retriever, Good Boy.
Somebody said you were looking for Rover...
It’s the only faithful thing on the planet
I like this one much better than the 2-legged Earthling we beamed up last time better.
See what happens if you pull on the antenna.
It appears we've captured a Rover.
Our research indicates that tail wagging precedes attempts to manipulate.
So do you guys speak English?
Get him off the set, Charlie, and call back the Klingon.
Rover,did you beam down your bone!
We would like to oblige, but on our planet, giving a belly rub is a declaration of war.
Those earthlings certainly have bad breath!
I present to you a very good boy
I think these Earthlings show some potential. Notice how friendly it seems.
Careful, Jim, his people have those humans trained..
And what can you tell us of the smaller "frisbees" you have encountered?
It is not a man but it is man's best friend
I still say it would be more cost-effective to train him to a litterbox...
Yeht evah ynam s'DOG
It's tag says 'Rover.', it's not just a dog.
"Woof, woof" means "Let's have sex" if our language....Oh, the same for yours!
Sorry Snorzaxxx , I found a new best friend .
He says he won’t take us to his leader without a treat first.
You flew all this way just to get a pet for your kid?
Now that you've been rescued, it's time for your vaccinations.
What do you mean, go for a walk?
"beam me up Scotty" They took us literally!
I think she wants to sniff our buts
Amazing...They can communicate without talking!
‘Huh— I wonder if I should tell the captain about Giant George’s walker/sitter not showing up this morning?’ Anything like that occur to you, Anderson? Like—before takeoff, maybe?
Beam yourself up, Scotty.
So why did the Fleas invent the Flea-Collar?
Our long journey is over for we have found the answer to the question that haunts the universe--who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
Your name tag says 'Leader'. So. . .can you speak or are you just gong to sit there?
Take us to your leader!
And the good boy is you every time?
The wag means that it is about to give us fake news.
I thought Invisible Fence had boundaries.
This polling sample is uncommonly upbeat.
Must be a friend of Pluto.
well, is fast food and a sedentary lifestyle still the best way to take over?
Do you think he's been microchipped?
He was detained for attacking our allies, the frisbees.
You can keep the earthling if you feed and clean up after him.
Being governed by dogs has many advantages - unconditional love, acceptance of all, ability to listen. Enjoy it!
He's saying we probably won't like his best friend.
Of the two we saw this is the superior species. The other one was picking its excrement.
Sorry about the bark collar, you were driving us nuts.
He’s an alien who is subservient to his masters.
Trust me, they'll treat them like their own children.
Hey, Buddy! Wanna go for a teleport?
On planet Dyslexia, she's a god.
He wandered a long way from home. We must take him back to Labrador.
Oh, speak stable genus! Don't just #wag your tail.
The term mission creep comes to mind.
Since we read right to left we have proved the extitence of god
They always look happy before we bring out the probe.
Well, I heard that his poop will burn and look like shooting stars!
See if it has to go outside.
He says he is the leader.
He's definitely brighter than those other beings on Earth.
Who wants to take Rover out for his walk?
I wonder where its nuts are?" "Frank this isn't a squirrel." "That's not what I meant.
We need you to go out there and fetch a very big spaceship.
...See? Just set it to Reverse! No more plastic bags!
I'm now realizing that wasn't snarflog I found in the corner.
I told you it would be a mistake to ask an earthling for pointers.
So far, we have determined that this incredible creature has at least 250 ways of expressing happiness using various wags of it's tail. It's the most intelligent Earthling we've discovered by a long-shot!
I told him to "sit," but you know I have trouble with the "s" sound.
This species shows a propensity to roll over.
This one seems nice. Let's skip the anal probe.
Let's name him Scotty.
- Are you sure it's not him? - Don't think so, they told us Donald Trump is a pig
they call it a cow and they drink liquid form its utters called milk and yes I'm sure this time.
The two-legged being it was with must be its pet.
Who's a good sentient life form? Yes you are. Oh yes you are.
Oops...we must return; the plan was an extraTERRIERestrial alien encounter
Does it Talk?
You better bring him out before he has another accident on the ceiling.
This isn't what I meant by "Bring me loyal subjects."
It’s not a scotty!
It seems like he's used to getting things shoved up his rectum.
What happens on that platform stays on that platform.
You really did go see a man about a dog.
The movement of his hind linear proboscis indicates that Earl is the one who offered the treat.
He knows 'shake,' 'heel,' and 'sit.' We're still working on 'take me to your leader.'
you look perfect; we will send you to a place called earth, which you will colonize and become everyone's best friend.
He seems to think it's a Frisbee.
Far more likable than I thought they would be.
The earthlings are primitive. They don't even seem to have a language.
Seemingly "Arf" is a placeholder word whose exact meaning is dependent on context and inflection.
Finally, our own rover!
Except for the tail, it looks like your Uncle Harry.
Don't give me some shaggy dog story about your mission exploring Earth.
I asked but Area 51's closed. Something about too many aliens from shithole countries landing there.
He wants to know if we can roll down a window.
We've captured their highest life form. Two-legged lesser beings follow him with plastic bags.
He must be the leader. The other one walks behind and cleans up its poop.
Who wants to take the earthling on its first spacewalk?
Earthling, we do not know what you mean by a “fire hydrant”!
Your mission, #526837501: to boldly 'go' on one Earth sidewalk every rotation.
Finally we can mate with a female! Wait, it’s female right? Oh crap Bob, you got the wrong one.
." . . And notify the other agents that our invasion is imminent."
Are you an alien?
This is promising..loyal, friendly, obedient...in other words, not just another shithole planet !
Do you think “We want to be man’s best friend” hit them wrong?
Be careful! He has a beam of his own.
How about ‘roasted on a bun’?
It's his language that's puzzling.
These earthlings have a funny way of communicating!
In any galaxy-no cookie, no fetch.
The humans put extensive effort into the care and maintenance of these creatures, however they perform no useful function as far as we can determine.
It would appear the earthlings have a far less sophisticated way of communicating than we predicted.
Looks delicious.
He says we took his bone
It's a good place. As long as you don't bite, they will give you free food and a home.
The collar says "Laika."
Definitely looks Jupiterian.
I can't remember - does a wagging tail mean it will bite me or lick me.
He wants to go for a W-A-L-K.
She's saying we're acceptable because we don't come from a shithole country.
When we asked you to stay we didn’t think it would be so long. Good dog.
The humans call this one, "The Good Boy." We can learn of their morality by studying him.
He's from the dog star.
I seem much smarter when you compare me to a human.
No! You take me to YOUR leader!
Well, for us Odorians it is the most intelligent species on that planet.
My name is not Scottie.
Is he going to be our best friend too ?
And, when we get to mars, will bring the whales and dolphins?
Ok, again. Stand up and it rises. Sit down and it lands.
Hmmm...Maybe we didn't think this through.
Let's see if we can get humans to touch its poop.
I walked him this morning.
I really tried when I was down there but they just can't learn to speak our language.
Should we sacrifice him first then eat him or straightaway start the feast?
I wish fetch was an indoor command. Sit is too boring.
But I'm 120 in space years.
His name is Ralph. He wanted to challenge the cow who jumped over the moon.
Finally, our instagrams will be able to compete with the Earthlings
We don,t look anything like him?
Muttnik, is that you?
Because when he wags his tail, he wants to go outside.
No more condescending me, I'm not the one from yours.
Scan her chip. See what planet she's from.
"You have a new best friend, don't you? Yes, you do!
Toto sent me.
Welcome to “The Farm”.
He's known as "good boy" on Earth.
Bark Rogers, reporting for duty
Who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy? Do you want a xbflazz?
That’s not a Scottie.
I’m so glad you’re competent speakers in tail wag. I’ve got to leave my shithole planet.
It sounded like Park! Park! Park! so we did.
Our copy of "To Serve Man" is missing and I think he ate it.
He wanted to come for a ride.
He thinks this is the Rainbow Bridge
It is an honour to meet “mans best friend”.
We want to tell you a bit about our button
This explains everything. Stephen Miller is from another alternate universe.
He saw our saucer, and that was it."
Hopefully, this one is smarter then the two legged variety that visited last week.
Tell him, no way. We are the ones who say 'Take me to your leader.'
He looks friendly.
Agent Fido already has them thinking he's their best friend.
Not the Mars Rover I had in mind
So even if we become their best friend, we still might have to run and get their slippers?
we trained them to walk behind us and bag our poops.
Well we did search for someone smarter than the president of the United States so we can’t complain.
I need to go out for a space walk!
'I guess it's a scottie.'
Are you sure it’s wxuvrz*? *edible
Bleep blork bloop bleek!
He wants to stay here. He refuses to take us to his leader.
No, no, I said Labradoodle!
It appears the Earth Rover is a good, good boy.
We thought you could help direct us to the dog star
I have a feeling somebody's waking up saying 'Doggone!'
Well obviously he's their leader, they pick up his poo.
When we told him to take us to your leader, he just took us to some guy with a bone in his hand.
I'm sorry, guys, but he seemed really smart and talkative on his Facebook page.
Excellent, Garlok. You have mastered all the tests with the final quiz.....the tail wag. Your mission is to make a trail of cheeseburgers to the pick-up spot so we can capture the President Unit.
I beamed up the head of the household.
Our intelligence people said that here, everyone speaks English.
Well, we know his owner from the collar, but from which dimension.
No, sorry, I’m not a doodle.
Well, we did tell the computer to fetch us a specimen.
He's cute but I ordered a Labradoodle.
Dave continues his intergalactic search for cheap therapy.
I told you not to beam up any more specimens.
Your mission on Earth was a success.
Don't feed it! We will never beam it back.
Welcome back, Agent 57! Or should I say “@realdonaldtrump?”
This species seems to hold more promise than the bipeds.
There is no out out there!
We said, "beam up Snoop Dog" ...I think we were expecting something different.
my studies show there ecwipt with small bombs to plant around its habitat.
Can we keep it? Can we?
I wonder if these people have pets???
Tell us how your people enslaved the forked creatures.
Wait, he may be trying to tell us something.
Doggone it! What is that creature?
We didn't see any drool in the holo-view.
There’s an extra treat in it if you bring Spock back alive.
Great, now if we want to keep the place clean we’re going to have to abduct a fire hydrant.
Be careful of his lightsaber.
We'll name him Red Rover.
Lassie, take me to your Timmy!!!
That's no Scottie?
Look, we've come a long way. Are you sure you don't know how to play bridge?
What do you think this alien is talking about?
I walked him last, Dad. I swear I did.
This should give "fetch a whole new meaning...
The planet is destroyed. We kept one Earth creature.
He really needs to be let out to pee.
This is his best friend.
Guess we'll have to leave E.T. behind. There's no entrance for him. Doggonit.
Well ... some of them are nice.
Did you bring the treats?
Hydrant? We assure you we have far superior fire suppression methods.
And who is going to walk him?
No-air Bud
Do you have an anything grain-free?
But how will we walk him?
You are emBARKING on your most important mission: gathering intelligence on earth.
We're only accepting purebreds.
The reason I brought your here...
I guess now we have to go back for a plastic bag
They worship this one by saying, ‘Good alien. Good alien.’
The universe needs more like you.
I mean, look at that - is that cute or what? He knows you're here to take him to his new home and he's gotten all clingy.
We don't have the leader but we have his best friend
PETA, yes we have heard of them.
He seems friendlier than our capture of radio signals suggested they are.
Luni was a biped before he was sucked in by that contraption
I was expecting a bunny.
Convince the people of Earth we are their friends, Ambassador Rex.
When we beam you back, ask your leader to send us three green-cards.
We notice that on your planet our kind follow your species around and pick up their poop. Is that negotiable?
They are more evolved then we imagined.
Alright hotshot. You try burying a bone in zero gravity.
You wanted a rescue, now you have to walk him.
Let's name him Dogstar.
Are you sure he is their Leader?
He answers to 'Scooter,' 'Mr. McScoots', 'Magoo', 'The Yellow One' or 'Beans'.
Gee, These aliens are rather cute.
This one says HE'S the master.
is it you, are you the good boy?
Out of this world best friend
He just got here and is already harassing me for a space-walk.
We are the crew of the USS Frisbee.
Well, they ARE more advanced in necklace technology.
It lacks a human element.
You must be the leader since those other creatures walk behind you and pick up your crap.
Take me to your gentle leader.
He might appear to be very young but in our years he'd be 2,046.
He must represent an advanced civilization; he is attempting to communicate through the appendage behind him and his soulful gaze.
I'll stay for 3 walks per day, 3 meals, unlimited snacks and massages.
No! No! Beam us down, Scotty! Down!
Well, sure it may not sound like a lot in dog years.
Didn't you just go out 20,000 light years ago?
What's that, girl? Lord Xlron is stuck in a supermassive black hole?
OK, Fido, one bark if they are friendly and two if they are not.
Intense tail movement implies happiness. Or maybe the need to urinate. Testing results have been inconclusive.
I suppose a 'Mars Rover' pun would fit right in about now.
The last Jedi, for real this time.
Please do not litter.
I thought humans would look more like us.
Wait, I've got a million of 'em
Star Paws, you like that buddy?
We asked to beam up the most intelligent life on earth - and it's cute too!
What? You guys don't like my disguise?
Now it's guaranteed, no one will have a better pet than my little Billy.
Yes, I lead them around. But I'm not the leader.
You can be the first dog whistle-blower.
If it’s a new best friend your after, no can do.
You asked to see me?
Wow, he is so much smarter than the last ones.
He’s loyal and likable...but it doesn’t explain why the humans collect his droppings.
Good...boy...?
I dias, "Ekat em ot ruoy dog!"
Beam up Scottie- not a Scottie the terrier!
What? Up dawg!
Why do we even bother with the Rover? We just get back sticks.
Lead me to your taker
Let's send this down to Earth and give them a scare.
It ate our GPS bot.
That planet makes rovers that are low-tech but awfully cute!
You want to sniff my Haiti?
Obviously it's the planet's most advanced and intelligent species.
We must understand the importance of their poo.
Well, we like to think of it as that farm upstate you've heard so much about.
So which one of you is going to take me for a walk?
I thought St. Bernards showed up with whiskey barrels.
What am I?
It's better to beam-up than to buy.
Earthling, you are our Master.
Whose turn is it, to take him out, to do his business?
Careful! He charms and enslaves two-legged beings.
2 Thumbs Up in this whacky comedic adventure packed full of fun for the whole family! You'll laugh your tails off at the silly shenanigans that ensue when these aliens adopt a dog in the award winning comedy Planet K-9.
I see that they've domesticated wolves since our last visit. They used to bite, now they lick.
One question: why is your manure valuable?
Rust ro reasy ron re ranal robes.
It looks like we have Sirius.
I say we call this planet “Halitosis”.
It’s your turn. I walked him yesterday.
Our children moved to an alternative Universe that does not allow dogs, so we got the puppy.
You didn't really think through the need for walkies did you?
Hablar. Dese la Vuelta. Tacon. Permanecer.
Anyone speak Russian?
If dog is the co-pilot, where is the pilot?
So the barking is just a ruse to get out of having to work for a living?
I just let him out to pee five light years ago.
Yes, captain. We'll set a course for 25 more times around the living room.
Don't know what they're called but he looks dog tired, is dog eared, and has a dogged determination.
I wonder if he's spaceship trained ?
Who's going to feed him and walk him and brush him?
I'm very suspicious of the wagging tail.
You're from the Dog Star? Are you Sirius? (and alternatively) You're from the Dog Star? Siriusly?
He's our Emotional Supportnaut.
We sent them the answer to "What does it all mean?" and they sent us this?
Next time he goes out to do his business have the solar wind to his back.
Always begging for a treaty.
We’ll call him Kirk.
HE SAYS ........"TIMMY FELL IN THE WELL".....
What intelligent eyes! I bet it knows exactly what we're thinking.
Is it true you can read in the dark?
How fetching!
No, no food or water until you reveal why you were chasing us.
Thank you for teaching us 'fetch.' Please explain 'walkies.'
You guys have got nothing on me.
As an emotional support animal, he is transported for free.
We've identified his language as Labradorean Woofish
It’s YOUR turn to take him out ... and shut the hatch ... we don’t need that stuff floating back inside!!!
I really thought the dogs where in charge.
He says you have the wrong guy, he's the beta
We selected him as a specimen, as he is said to have the same I.Q. as the president of one of earths richest countries.
#1 or #2?
I'm willing to go with you if your language isn't "blah, blah, blah".
#SaturnIsForTheGoodBoys
Good sit. Now give us your best and loudest bark.
The other one just kept throwing the little planet away, but this one saved it every time!
This one looks more promising.
And you were negative for worms.
Nobody here speaks English.
No, it's a different kind of vacuum.
It's a virtual crate. And he feels secure in there.
This human has floppy ears.
We still haven’t deciphered the meaning of those brown scrolls he keeps dropping.
It must be their leader... they carry its poop in a bag.
This Twitter thing, is it like your species leaving messages on grass and trees?
Take us to your tweeter.
Whoa, so this is a human!
There's been a terrible mistake. We asked them to beam up DOCTOR Barker.
First observation....they don't have a tail like we do.
You are a good pinnacle species
After monitoring two orbit cycles of communications media, we believe these to be the most intelligent beings on the planet.
We've done it! We've found intelligent life on Earth!
It’s about time!
Oops ... looks like we beamed-up Scotty.
I think we better follow him.
Woof.
Don't let him out just yet. I would like to keep him under observation.
Their worship includes picking up his poop, so he must be their leader.
Take me to your feeder!
" Can we keep him, please?.
Sara McLachlan is very persuasive.
I'm glad we got him from a shelter and not one of those breeders!
You are welcome to stay, but you will never have it better than on planet Earth.
Does anyone speak Russian?
Oops ... looks like we beamed-up Scotty.
Who’s turn is it to take the dog for a space walk?
She just won the 2020 presidency. Can't wait to question her on intelligence on earth.
Who’s a good,very stable genius,boy?
Who's a good alien....you are.....
But why do they pick up your excrement in plastic bags?
He won't get off the escape hatch. He thinks it's a giant frisbee
Finally! We got the one that leads the two-legged kind around!
It translates as 'Fire Hydrant! Now!'
OK, their plan to win us over just may work.
We caught it, but now we don't know what to do with it.
You're positive this is the alpha predator?
Who’s a good quadruped?
If that's Pluto lets see what Uranus looks like.
Well, this isn't gonna fit on the probe.
Do you think he's sending us a message with his tail wagging?
Quibble all you want with my methods, I'm still calling it a rescue.
I understand one of its primary functions is to fetch something called a 'newspaper'.
Come on, guys--you know the poop has to be beamed up, too.
Maybe all the cat videos weren’t misdirection after all.
Wait. Was it you that phoned home?
I don't think it understands the gravity of the situation.
He warns of something called Harvey Weinstien
I set the search term to ‘astrolabe’
He must really want his ball.
Adorable, yes, but who's going to wake up early every morning to take Fido out for a spacewalk?
I guess this is us in an earlier stage of development.
Who's a good adolescent Snorlaxian? You are!
He's good at catching flying discs.
It’s always happy, so it can’t be human.
YU cheatfg yug quuc ieal galm geh gupo Hyujeh hel fyuc quurp.
Some people call me the space cowboy.....
Wow, Earth cats are weird.
Can we keep him, Captain? Please?
Only your kind understood our planet-wide command to chase this shiny spinning disc.
Just to be clear, I'm in charge now.
When commodore zyteck asked for the lab, i’m beginning to wonder if he meant laboratory.
He doesn't look like a Rex...
I felt sorry for him. I asked him about life on Earth and all he kept saying was, "Rough, rough, rough!"
We're very impressed with your enslavement of these creatures who house and feed you and pick up your waste products. We call that the trifecta.
He speaks one tough earth person language. We still have not cracked it.
Rover reports for duty
Yes, but is a man worthy of a best friend like you.
But we don't have any bones.
Take me to your bone.
Space, the Fido Frontier.
So on this planet more legs does mean greater intelligence.
I said, beam me up Scotty, not a golden
These Earthlings are much different than I thought.
Alien 1: This is the nicest thing you can find on Earth? Alien 3: Lately, the Earth-life has been ruff...
No, no. He said beam up my Scottie.
Beam him back up after he does his thing.
And for some reason, oftentimes they seem to enjoy licking their own lips.
I have brought you three here to study you further.
Having amended our design to include the wagging tail, our modeling now predicts that this will become Man's Best Friend.
His collar indicates his name is Sparky, he's gluten free and lives on Riverside Drive.
It is your turn to take him out for a walk.
He says his anus has already been probed.
I'm not sure if your Universal Translator can pull this one off...
She keeps saying something about a "Timmy" and a "well".
I think he means Klaxor is trapped in a black hole.
A furry?
Scotty finally beamed up.
Man, Trump's presidency is so bad that even dogs are leaving.
Johnson, stop asking him to roll over." "I'm beaming him outside before bedtime.
Because you are the best example of love, and loyalty.
And don't forget - "Who's a good boy?" is a rhetorical question.
Shouldn't we take the collar off before we use the panini press?
Are you Scotty?
Snack? Have you got a snack?
ARF???
I told you - humans can't talk!
I said, "Beam me up Scotty, not Fluffy."
Who do you think 'Arf! Arf!' means?
Take a ride boy??
Evidently the planet's dominant species. The taller, two-legged ones' only function seems to be collecting the waste of this one.
Inform Lord Grok they are willing to accept the treaty.
Rex was always fond of eggs but became even more excited when they told him there were no cats on planet Humpty.
He’s telling us the liberals of his planet are in distress.
Are you sure it's spelled "G-O-D," not "D-O-G"?
If you get any motion sickness, just shake it off.
Getting used to new technology can sometimes be Ruff.
“Beam me up beagle” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
As I suspected,, minaturizing Zabaff was a mistake.
Beam me up, I'm a Scotty.
Okay, now beam me up a Scottie!
Are your shots up to date?
Let's study him before he becomes one of us.
We should beam him up, but he's no Scottie.
I think it looks more like a Lab than Scottie.
Say goodbye to partisan politics. With Old Yeller here as my running mate, I'll coast through the 2020 election.
Good dog. Now, fetch earth.
Sorry. We don't have an outdoor bathroom.
That's right Rex , there is no Trump on our planet!
Alien says, "You see, all dogs don't go to heaven."
Fetch your leader
Where is the human you took for a walk?
Why didn't you tell us you were the higher life form we were looking for?" "It's not that you couldn't understand me, it's that you didn't ask.
The beast insists he is fixed, but probing indicates his reproductive system is broken.
Earthlings are much more intelligent than we suspected -- and potty-trained to boot.
Fetch!
...and we don't have any of those disposable plastic bags on board.
I think it needs to go out.
Go fetch us some earthlings.
Just give him some space. He’ll warm up to us eventually.
See? There is a dog!
An advanced species with a hidden identity chip.
Whoo! Apparently I said "Take me to your BREEDER" in his language. Things got wacky after that!
Beam up Scottie, Scotty.
Interesting! This dog is wagging his tail. I thought it was the other way around.
So we finally meet a human. Strange looking species.
I still think Pluto is a planet!
He's definitely the most intelligent life form on the planet.
The owner let go of the neck ring at 25,000 feet.
Multiple missions to Earth and we've finally succeeded in finding a sign of intelligent life.
Yes, this is the highest form of life we've found on planet "earth."
How did you learn our language?
They swore this was their leader.
Captain Kirk, is that you?
Sorry, Xzbul, our teleporter had a slight glitch.
Keeps saying "woof "???
When the earthling wags his tail we are supposed to obey.
Earth dog take us to your, like, really smart leader.
Well, dont expect me to take him out at night!
Mankind's best friend, reporting for duty.
We should have beamed up the other end of the leash.
We believe it is the lone survivor of the dog-eat-dog world.
We offered to return him to the White House, but he insists on staying with us.
Whats with the low waving antenae?
I know what I heard. You distinctly said "Beam me up Scottie."!
Two characters from the end of the sentence “where is your leader” his back part waggles incredibly fast
We may have misjudged you... we believe it's a "litter box"?
If my calculations are correct, this species has indeed taken over the planet.
Take us to your owner.
It's a kind of Russian roulette, he has selected me to do the outside repairs.
Man’s best friend shows more promise.
I haven’t decided which one’s the carry-on and which one’s the personal item...
He looks, like, really smart!
They don't call her man's best friend for nothing.
Tree? What’s a tree?
Okay, whose turn to take him out?
Beam him down. He needs to go out.
Prepare the canine probe.
How about Rover?
How about God?
Beam me up, Scottie!
Think he's microchipped?
I think he is trying to tell us that he’s been trained.
Follow me down to the planet and I'll take you all walkies.
It's pretty much what I imagined.
Well, Scottie, we beamed you up; now take us to your dog-less leader.
He is either their god or a prisoner.
Which one of you is going to take me for a walk on the moon?
If we only knew their word for 'roll over!'
Amazing, his bark is actually worse than his bite.
Who’s my good unidentifiable hairy thing?
He's got to go! Beam him down Scottie!
I know! Doggie: Klaatu, Barada, Nikto.
His tag says "Scotty."
Unfortunately he has gas.
C'mon, boy: Wag less, bark more!
Okay agent Gorloc, we are eager to hear your report on the annal probes you performed at the Henderson's dinner party.
I say we keep him and call him Fang.
Different than the other carbon-based lifeforms on this planet, this one is a 100% good boy.
I think he's lost.
...you really want to go disguised as a dog this time?
I asked him to speak but all I got was 'bark'.
Either of you guys remember the ‘80s remake of ‘The Thing’ ?
Can I make a piss tape instead?
He's our best friend now.
Woof woof woof. Woof woof woof. Woof woof?
The order was "HAIR! Lots of Hair! as in Russian wolfhound, Norwegian elkhound, etc, etc, etc."
Oh yeah. This one. Not too bright but it sure knew what Zardoz did with the anal probe didn’t it?
I understand that its President Trump new ambassador to South Korea.
We’re taking you to our planet - it’s called Sticks.
Have you heard the one about the bald groomer?
Don't look at me - this thing did it!
This is the third time this week we caught you pouring scotch in th toilet water.
Dogs have owners? We call that slavery!
I believe the moving appendage on this species is used by humans to sweep their floors.
Btrfaaq!
We better land, he needs to go outside.
Williams-Sonoma was out of Peppermint Bark.
This one will reproduce. It’s fixed.
What's this thing called "poop"?
What’s this? I was expecting a Scottie to be beamed up...
To lead or not to lead?
What they lack in intelligence they make up for in cuteness.
That's right Sparky, we will now teleport you back to earth so you can fetch us more of those lovely squeeky-ma-bobs we love.
You, major, and your crew have done a great job convincing them your their friends. We will coomence the attack soon !
With a knick-knack paddywack, give the dog a bone, this UFO is taking you home.
Is she itching?
At last, we have found their leader.
Congratulations, you have just been named Dog of the Galaxy
Until we can decypher their language, we should respond in kind. Commander GL3RPH, stick your nose in its crotch.
They sent him here to mark their territory.
He asked to be taken to our leader.
You gotta do more than wag your tail to get beamed up!
Yes Sir – Spock must play ball with you because you are the new Captain.
Well we never thought where he could do his business.
Do you think Mother will let us keep him?
Dogmatic?
I said beam me up SCOTTY
Beam you where, Spotty?
I don't get it; we're green, how come he keeps calling us "Greys?"
He followed my phone home.
He has trailed humans to find cats and fire hydrants.
Does this mean we've been in the Twilight Zone for the past four years? Thank god!!!
C'mon pooch! We can't go home until you fetch the joystick!
Cartoon submission
Take me to your pet waste station. Then your leader.
According to the rear appendage the creature is saying "Wag more, bark less."
Who's going to walk him?
I told you earthlings wouldn't look anything like us.
I warned you not to get into that rock, paper, scissors competition with the cat.
Their slaves have interplanetary exploration, yet have not succeeded in overthrowing their masters.
It's their fearless leader.
It's 200 light years to Zircon. I wish you hadn't forgotten the dog food.
Looks like a dog to me.
You sure this is the one trained to go in the MRI machine?
I know! Let Mikey probe him. He'll probe anything.
Have any of you seen a bone around here?
Time for party: make another poo poo so we can watch it float.
Who let Mike order lunch?
They've become more human since our last visit.
How did you get them to solve the turd problem?
The earthlings are much furrier than I imagined
Is it just me or is he starting to look like us?
OK... one more time ... how do you get people to pick up your poop?
Blorg got one and says they're out of this world.
Hands off, guys; this best friend is mine.
You wanna go for a spacewalk buddy?
We search the universe for good boys.
Have our lab run tests on him.
There's a lot they figured out yet, but you've got to appreciate how keen they were to let me know I was a good boy.
President Trump said that any old dog could do it.
We need your help to create a hyperdrive, ohyeswedo
I think you meant, "We'd like to speak to your God?"
Who is Timmy, and what is a well?
Supposedly he's the best friend.
I think we are going to the dogs
Enunciate carefully, lest they beam you up a Scottie.
Cancel the Planet Destruction orders Zarf! These Earthlings aren't the violent destructive species we mistakenly believed them to be.
I’ll call the transporter 1-800 number.” “I’ll get the transporter manual.” “I’ll find something I can fashion into a poop bag.
Hmm...so Earth really is a dog-eat-dog world.
He kept on hugging my leg sir, I thought he would be perfect for my “love on earth” experiment.
They said only one carrying per family.
Apparently, he'd the leader's best friend.
I guess I picked the wrong owner, they don’t go by the fancier necklace.
Hi, my name is Scotty...
You mean you don't know about Canis Major? You can't be serious.
I guess it’s true. All dogs go to Saturn.
It can move!
He's sure a lot nicer than his two-legged companions. Let's beam him back down and start over.
So, rock/paper/laser to see who goes down to pick it up?
I like the concept of a Therapy God. Maybe it will help my dyslexia!
What, Dr. Who? Something weird happened to your regeneration? And Timmy was captured by the Daleks?
I say why suffer...go ahead and do a hair of the dog.
Oh sure! As soon as he has to go outside he's my dog.
But I asked for a Scottie!
I prefer these to the bipeds.
Affirmative: Specimen is most advanced species on planet."
Do you think he knows where we can find Elvis?
I thought Earthlings would look more like us.
When we take him for a walk, do we have to pick up the do-do?
Darn, they dress and look alike - can't remember who took me for a walk.
It is INDEED a very, very odd little creature. I wonder if it might be what the earth-people call a 'politician'?
Captain Cat will not be pleased. Captain Cat will not be pleased. So this is the creature the earthlings worship.
Having developped four legs he should speak, too !!
You know, you guys look kind of weird too, don't you?
Will this disguise make him the top dog?
Are you sure this is the Lassie we saw on TV?
He says his best friend now identifies as a woman
sounds like Greek to me
Thin collar- probably lower cast.
Captain we seem to be having a problem with molecular regeneration module.
What's a dog?
He's cute, but I said to beam up a scottie, not a labbie.
Give us all your poop on planet Earth.
"Can we be your best friend too?'
You did say that we wanted God as our copilot, right?
can you find the spaceship keys?
Yes, we have finally harnessed the power of tail wagging energy!
The Zinalites' mission to destroy earth was abruptly terminated when they found earth creatures to be too darn lovable.
I wonder if he can breathe fire like the ones on our home planet?
We had tails at one time, right?
Probably a better choice for a best friend than ‘man’ was....
Dog-Gone-It
It's your turn to walk him.
A close encounter of the furred kind.
What's that girl? Our comrade has fallen into a gravity well?
Just Beam it back DOWN...
I'm pretty sure we got the more intelligent one.
Golden retriever > Golden (orange) president
Take us to your best boy
Who let the dog up? Who, who, who, who?
On the Intetgalacticnet, no one knows you're a dog.
Do you think he's spaceship trained?
Do you have all your shots?
The earthling's rear antenna moves like that whenever we ask it who's a good boy.
Woof.
In or out? C'mon boy, make up your mind.
He said he would take all of us to his leader.
Humans seem really nice.
He's wearing a collar, but where's his leader?
Admit it, guys. The coolest motherfucker on four legs right there.
I told you I would find a great spot.
I could have sworn he told me to beam up Spotty.
They have not yet advanced to standing on two feet or having opposing thumbs.
Advanced ljfe form ?
His tags says his galaxy of origin is B-I-N-G-O
We're sending you down as a Hollywood producer, you'll fit right in.
So,how do we become your best friend?
X9 finally got the tail thing right. It's time to beam him down.
He may not always be the most well-behaved pet, but at least he's housetrained
Lots of sticks and balls, but he hasn't retrieved any gold yet.
We tried to capture his custodian, too, but she dropped the leash and ran away.
He looks a lot like my Xeno. Might even be littermate.
It's your turn to take him outside.
Can we beam with you to your lead dog?
Do you think they spell their words from left to right?
I told you barking at the moon is an earthly expression.
The invisible fusion fence isn't working.
I shall name him after my shuttlecraft, Rover.
Was this incoming or outgoing?
This must be heaven. No Cats !
Hell, if you feed us, we'll be your best friend.
On our planet dogs are people and people are dogs.
Looks like somebody needs to go for a space walk.
What is your secret to make humans follow you on a leash and then clean up your mess?
This one seemed to be in charge.
I didn't know humans were so funny-looking!
All I said was beam me up Spottie!
This is America's leader?
Siriusly?
Why do I want to pet it on the head so badly?
I'm pretty sure that this is a human.
As Xzorkians we'll call it Xzorkis Best Friend.
So...you're man's best friend. Tell us everything you know.
To be honest, I had a different meaning of the word 'wrecks' in mind.
We probably should have abducted a few newspapers too.
Play along. You're man's best friend, until you're not...
He's the intelligent one, the one with the two legs picks up after him.
Beware , it's a doggy dog world out there , and barking is not always a biting remark .
Didn’t you ask them to send the receiver?
I found her in the SPCE.
Let's start by setting some ground rules. First, I prefer a good cab to water with my kibble.
Are you Chuck Berry?
He seemed to think we were examining him backwards.
Humans don't deserve dogs anyway.
It's your turn. I walked him last earth orbit.
Why dogs should never take themselves out at night.
When the boss said "earthling" he was being general, right?
Human anus, am I right?
Gotta go! Please tell me that there are trees up here!
New immigration laws, beam me up, Fido.
Please, master, tell us we are going to Pluto this holiday....
Are you a good witch? Or a bad witch?
You have posted wrong cartoon today- my caption below is for Maslin , dated for Jan 7 : " It's a Muellersaurus"
Apparently he is more intelligent than an equivalently aged human scholar of high achievement in something called 'middle school'.
It's about to go where no dog has gone before.
Rough? Rough? We'll give you 'rough' if you don't tell us about your planet!
I know your species isn't exactly the brightest, but surely you understand that was meant to be a cookbook.
Mr. Spock, meet Mr. Spot.
Any ideas for when he has to go out?
You're going to be the first outer space "Old Yeller!"
Why did you beam him up, Scotty?
When he said he would send his best friend I thought that it would be human
This earthling seems quite stable, possibly a genius.
You're now 3,000 years old in dog years but we'd like to teach you a new trick.
He seems to want to leave our craft for a walk.
I said Beam her not Bowser!!!
Pluto!
Man's best friend, eh? Boy, you're going to love this ride in the car.
We give you our word of honor that you are NOT in Asia!!!!!!
In retrospect, maybe we should have abducted a cat.
All it says is woof.
Our planet will never need to mop again.
I hope you know there are no dog days in outerspace
He may be able to tap unto the "dog gone truth."
Yes, they expect me to fetch. Can you believe it?
No, you may not probe our butts!
I thought we could start with a dog and then see if we want to move on to a human.
In dog light years, you’re seven times smarter than a cat.
Seriously, who told him my name was Arf?
Uh oh, it wants to go for a walk.
Don't get us wrong - We'd LOVE to keep you, but we simply don't have a fenced-in space port.
Yes, this one's friendly. But don't beam up any one with pointy ears.
This isn’t what I pictured when I demanded Earth’s greatest treasure.
If its leader likes getting its face licked I’m not sure we should stick around.
We beamed it up as it was trying to catch our exploratory saucer craft in its teeth.
Poor fella lost his onesie.
I hope "walkies" doesn't mean what I think it means.
Who's the retriever now bitch?
We'll name him Clifford the Big Red Dog.
This planet isn’t as advanced as we thought.
Nuts to this 'Beam me up, Scotty,' ya got the wrong breed!
We just EVA'd him an hour ago, and besides, every time he sees Sirius he sprints out towards it at Light Speed.
Who abducted who?
Bluarg this isn't a homo sapien
It was the dog. Also, we breathe methane.
My how you've changed since we last saw each other.
Anybody know what "potty" is?
Take me to your gentle leader.
The small pointy eared creature is more intelligent although this is better than those two-legged things.
We've discovered Pluto.
We've determined he's not very advanced. But he's a very good boy.
I guess it depends on what you mean by "intelligent life".
Our dogged commander says bow WOW, which means the view is out of this world.
At least this one seems more intelligent than the two-legged ones.
Trust me, this is much better.
You beamed me to the wrong ship, Scottie Dog!
But I wanted a Scottie.
So, tell us about this friend of yours...
All we want to know is how you are able to control the lives of who call themselves your "owners."
Don't forget the New York Times delivery bag if you take him out.
You can’t go out. Dog Waste is Space Junk!
He responds well to entitlement programs.
If it's a "dog," we dissect it. If it's a "god," we talk with it.
?dog rieht dnuof ew evaH
I always heard humans were dogs...
I think he's saying, "Where's the grass?
He says that in fact, the world really belongs to them.
Who’s gonna walk him?
And so you're back from outerspace. I just walked in . . .
We thought he may be a Russian spy
Good beam up! Good beam up!
We can’t be that bad. Dogs and babies like us!
We understand they are quite trainable.
We need a copilot.
Beaming the dog up was perfectly logical.
Make sure to put peanut butter on the wall, before your probe it.
I specifically requested a matador.
Unless the labels were crossed, this is the all powerful god.
Whatever it is, It's much more intelligent than the human we beamed up yesterday.
Beam me up Sparky
Oh wise one from far off lands, I have one question", where's my kibble?
Did it come from inner or outer space?
I’m just thankful I don’t have to go through this alone.
Guys, I told you, there are no pets allowed on the Big Forehead Club's metallic observatory!
Seriously. I am the leader.
We found him at the White House and all he can say is VERY STABLE GENIUS.
Maybe he has a chip
So you had a little fun this weekend. Gonna miss him?
I kinda like you in this outfit.
We would ask you to take us to your leader, but he already sent us a Tweet.
There are miles to go before we land.
I believe it is your turn to walk him , Zork.
From this one we will learn to make humans serve us like slaves.
O.K. Who's taking me walkies?
Alert intergalactic control- this looks like one bad perro.
I'm amazed how retro space travel still is.
It is clear that the beings on this planet have been unfairly maligned.
'His collar says he's a professor'
This is the smartest life on the planet?
He marked me as his territory, I guess we have to take him back with us.
He’s quite agreeable, otherwise, but will only agree to take us to his gentle leader.
...and this time put Mr. Whiskers in the teleporter, not the microwave
Before we take him home, did you get the blue bags?
Dog-on-it! He doesn't look like Captain Kirk!
We'll name him number four.
Earthling is sniffing us, seems curious
The earthlings seem friendly.
He says he is from a galaxy far, far away
Why do I taste peanut butter?
I've got a chip and a collar, what more do you need?
Speak English!
He's out-of-this-world.
Aliens! My favorite thing!
Pluto? That's a silly name for a dog. Let's call him, Walt.
He looks friendly...too bad we must exterminate any species that eats meat.
Earthlings are a primitive species...no opposable thumbs.
I think he wants to be walked.
I've read where Dog is my Pilot.
I told you to get the human walking with him!
Missing Dog
What is 'go outside'?
Your leader, not your best friend.
First mans best friend, then the world!
It seems there is intelligent life on earth after all!
Don’t worry, we’ll take you on space walks.
I'm not sure I like that trembling, maybe we should send it back!
Maybe he doesn't know how to say good-bye.
As you can see our ship is fueled by...well, let's just say it sure beats the little plastic bag I used to have to carry around when we went on walks.
Beam me up Scotty, I'm surrounded by elmer fudds
Can't he just use the litter box?
Scotty? Is that you boy?
We will go walkies after the rectal examination Earthling
Aliens vs. Dogs
It has a complex brain: ball, food, stomach rub, squirrel.
I am no inter-galactic canine
I'm very sorry, but we don't have a chip reader on board.
He’s no Norwegian Elkhound, but least he’s not a Chihuahua.
That’s interesting. The two legged ones always wait for us to start the anal probing.
You're WHOSE best friend?
Impressive, but can you smell dead life forms on other planets?
BALL? What is a BALL???
Show us how you trained them to follow you around with a poop scooper.
Appears to be a race that's friendly and loyal.
He's waving that lever, bet he's giving us a treat!
Such a smart dog! He already knows to tap on the pod door when he has to go out.
Your leader sounds like a pig.
This is the smallest dog run I have ever seen.
When I said beam me up Scotty, what part of Scotty didn’t you understand?
Time to move to Phase Two for world conquest, activation of all sleeper cells.
Your orders are, Officer Zork, to find their Alpha and bring him to us. Don't bother looking at Mar-a-Lago.
This earthling is nothing but a hound dog--scratching ALL the time.
It's okay . . . but I'd prefer it had a cushion.
The model ship could work as a frisbee.
Looks like we found C3FiDo.
Finally, we've got one of the elites.
You walk him!” “No, you walk him!
Let's call the Jetsons and get this over with.
It’s not our target, but it may be his best friend.
Speak.......earthling.......speak!
Oh hai Doggie heh heh heh
Are you ready to boldly go where no emotional support dog has gone before?
But fetch is my favorite game!
Now, which of you knows how to express anal glands?
OMG, I am 110% sure I remember humans looking like us. This Mandela Effect totally blows my mind.
It must be his brain... you can see it thinking.
Luke, I am your Fido!
is this the right spot?
Tell us again how you get the Earthlings to clean up your crap for you.
I think he's earthleen leader.
If “woof” means “out”, that’s not an option.
We know nothing of this thing called 'Pooper-Scooper...'
You sure this guy’s their leader?
He's very possessive of anything that looks like food.
Remember "Paw, Sit, Speak and Roll Over"
You see that tail wagging'? We're in!
Who's a good abductee? You are!
On the Enterprise, nobody knows you're a dog.
So who's gonna take him out for a walk?
Os siht si tahw yeht drager sa God?
I distinctly said “leader,” not “retriever.”
He’d look ridiculous sitting next to a Victoria.
I don't know either, but I think we are expected to scoop its poop.
Looks friendly, but you never know -- could be a Pit Bull!
Are you what they call a cat?
You know to project your voice farther from where I sit?
They're even cuter IRL
Well, we tried the Konmari method and now all we have is this dog.
I'm getting a ravenous hunger for what seems to be called, "anything."
First it sniffs us, then he shakes its . . . what would you call it?
You are to become man's best friend and report back.
It speaks our language.
Scotty hacked us!! But, what is it?!!?
If this is their leader, where does he keep his brain?
We have to send him back. He has a strange approach on how 'to serve man'
Take him to our breeder.
("I can smell the treat ... but which of these three is holding it...?")
Let us know what you find out.
Before we send him home, he says he wants to see Pluto.
For once the subject seems to appreciate your technique, Ork.
It's the only sign of intelligence I could find in that big white building down there.
We've come to emancipate your people.
It’s too cute to dissect.
We needed some “best friends” in our world, so we brought you up from Earth.
I am telling the three of you... "your going to have to be MUCH more limber, to be able to do what we can do."
I said, ‘Beam me up Scotty, not Spotty.’
Either this is their god or our reflective signal is malfunctioning
So...Goldie is the new Scottie?
Can I ask you a favor? I meant to submit this last week (ankle-biting dinosaur): "Honestly, as an introvert, I find being under cave-arrest to be a relief." <3 whether or not you can do this for me :)
I can see how he could be best friend material.
I ordered you to beam up the complete rover. Where's the wheels?
If you insist, but it's a big backyard.
He can be taught to fetch an earthling.
I think he's telling us that it is a dog eat dog world out there
Take me to your lead.
Hey Boy....Ready for your first Spacewalk?
Careful, supposedly these are hot!
Somehow they have convinced them to pick up their waste and feed them over and over
He seemed really anxious to get off of the planet.
No, I am the leader. The humans decided to just cede power when the pee tape came out
No, I don't think they eat dogs.
My name is no long Captain Oecl. My new name is Snowball.
We are curious about your attachment to an inferior species that walks upright.
No dogie door?
I don’t think we landed on the right spot.
We've come from many light dog years away.
Where on Earth did you find this dog???!!
BOW down now. He may well be our savior incarnate.
I thought the "Rover" would be more versatile.
So, how do you go to the bathroom?
This specimen is man's best friend, but we don't know what that means.
Uh, oh. This means Captain Kirk is being neutered.
What's that, Lassie? Timmy got abducted by aliens?
Ruff! Ruff, ruff, arf, ruff, ruff.
Which way should we beam Rex this time to discourage him from coming back, Down?
You know I expect a treat for this
This time the shadow Israel
Dog gone doesn't mean I'm going to disappear.
Speak, Buddy, Speak!
Don't give me that look. It's Year of The Dog and the last leader wasn't much better.
No bone, no leash, no kennel? Does Earth think we’ve got a pet store in space?
Here’s our hostage. Let’s negotiate with its best friend now.
Don't worry, I'll let the dog out.
Do you suppose that wiggler is how they make babies?
So this is what happens when you don’t calibrate the transporter before its first use...
Humans even pick up their excrement. Who did you was in charge?
Thanks Dad. He's out of this world!
Good boy, Fido, now float!
I'm not that kind of a leader.
For the ten thousandth time, Red Rover. “Don’t come over!”
I love my new place, but the security system is so Cretaceous.
"I know. They were out of therapy dogs." FOR CONTEST DUE 1/7
We read what you wrote on the Internet but we didn't know you're a dog!
I thought you said beam up a Scottie.
When we saw your companion pick up what you dropped, we knew you had to be the superior being.
Agenda for the Day: beam dog out, beam dog in, beam dog out, beam dog in
Where do you live?" -" White House!
! God, rieht si siht oS
Now Earthlings will not be the only life form that posts adorably funny dog videos
He knows them better than anyone.
We won't be making Westminster in time.
"Now remember you are being sent to observe, NO biting their leader you might get rabies!
Their leader 'Rumpf' is a bit 'arf' she says.
To summarize, earthlings have fur, sleep a lot, and enjoy sniffing each other's bottoms.
If that was your best friend, what would you do with it?
Is it you, Scotty?
It costs a little more than coach, but he likes the extra legroom
Sorry Captain, it just seemed to want to chase after us as we flew by.
They do feed us, play fun games, scratch our bellies, pick up our poop...but if you are set on wiping them out for your new colonies, we can help. All we ask is that you include their obnoxious house cats in your disposal plans.
Good dog! You followed the scent of our tractor beam!
Well, guess it's time to anally probe this dog.
This is what they call a "best friend."
I can do it here and now, or you can take me outside for a walk.
Tell them we all look like you
I said beam me up a scotty. (The last word should be underlined.)
Do not you think their President Trump will be suspicious if it shows up unannounced? Put an Apple Pie under its collar. He will be too focused on that to think of anything else.
We understand there is a more intelligent species on your planet, but we have no evidence of that so far.
I'm still not convinced they are saving what they collect in those little bags
I don't know why we got a hound. You clearly said, "Beam me up a scotty."
I'm a first tenor. Who sings bass?
Insurance won't approve beaming up dogs.
A take off of alien's BFF.
Which one of you's Scotty?
Are you the one they call Superman?
We wanted to beam up the Earthlings' chief deity, but someone may have reversed the inputs on our teleporter.
Capture and release
Beam me up, Fido!
Well, I'm sure it's okay - but, what's doo-doo? "
If you spell it backwards, you get God... Which makes sense because humans follow them around picking up their poop...
He really likes when I say "up"
Contrary to what appears daily on Twitter, it seems that Earthlings are friendly creatures.
This is why we traveled 876 light years?
Looks like Zork ran into some trouble in the dog park on his way up!
I say we skip the usual examination.
We'll go for a walk later.
Do they have any drugs?
We rescued her from Sputnik, she was stuck in orbit
"We're not in Kansas, anymore, Spike We're not in Kansas, anymore, Missy.
Doug... I think you pressed the wrong button.
Well, the people seem friendly.
The judge says I can't leave my cave for 30 days.
"Do you happen to know an earthling named 'Scotty'"?
His tag says Mutnik.
Seasonal Affective Disorder? Nah, doesn't bother me much.
A Dog's Purpose 2: To Serve Man
He ain't nothin' but a hound dog.
That looks like a light fixture above us, but it's really a 1,000-pound weight that springs and squishes earth beings flat as what they call a pancake.
Ok. We can finally ask, "Who'se on first?".
We should call him Space Bud!
This is their leader?
Quick! Grab a teleportation excretion waste bag.
Go say "Hello" to Rex out in Phoenix, his probe has been acting up.
For the last time, I'm not a Scottie, I'm not even a terrier and I don't know how to beam anybody anywhere.
And then they pick up my poop and put it in a bag! It is a treasure.
He ate Zork.
They call it slin the dog —winner gets it. But what is it?
Who's a good mrpht? Who's a good mrpht?
So this is what an earthling looks like!
Anyone speak "dog"....
CONGRATULATIONS! You have made the final cut even if you are not a celeb.
The technique is a little archaic, but we’re clearly on the same page here.
I'm sure what I said was "Beam me a SCOTTIE."
ok, whose turn it is to walk him today?
Pluto's not a planet anymore, now they're letting dogs in; what in the black hole is the universe coming to?
I only abduct rescues.
"We received a directive to beam up a 'Scotty.' You are a terrier from Scotland, I presume.'
I wish I'd heeded your warning -- she IS a man-eater. She's chewed me up. I just hope she'll spit me out.
But to eliminate all cats would violate the First Law!
We need grass for the Potty Transporter.
Don’t tell me you have to go again!
If you let me keep him, I promise to space walk him and synthesize food for him and disintegrate all his poop.
That's the display of blind loyalty our leader wanted us to find for a job in his administration.
It's a message from their leader. He say's "It's a dog's world."
It looks like You beamed up a Scotty.
It's man's best friend but it can't even talk.
Please tell us. How did you train them to pick up your poop?
He thinks he will fly into the future
What's kibble?
Take us to your planet’s leader.
We also want to meet Kibbles and Mr. Bits.
Take you to my leader? I am THE alpha dog!!
‘Our leader?’, you might not want to start there.
Let's hope the neutering goes smoother than with the two-legged specimen.
Maybe I'll try slower this time? Meeeooooww.
Alright guys, fine. But NOONE can know about this.
Yes, I'm man's best friend, but I am willing to negotiate.
This is the only creature there who accepts life as it is.
!god ti llac yeht
They seem friendly.
Sniffing is OK but no probing.
Who's a good scouting party? You're a good scouting party!
They pick up the leader's turds on this planet, too!
You’re our most trusted source. We have to ask, what’ the heck is going on down there?
He’s a little pudgy, so let’s hide the kibble.
Alright, Scout, what's the latest down there?
You're right, there's no intelligent life on the planet
Ah, Martians best friend!
I'm a dog. You know, man's best friend (???).
It's true, they elected the orange man
He sure is friendly.
Please explain the mind control techniques you employ on homo sapiens.
AREN'T YOU TAKING "GO FAR, FAR AWAY" A LITTLE TOO FAR?
Nothing from him yet about his leader, but something tells me we won't have any problems with the treaty.
We love you too, Laika, but it's time to go home and start Earth's takeover.
You say Ensign Timmy's in the hydroflexor?
. . . and then he'll return right after he's done his business.
Once you fly in a saucer with an automatic poop transporter, you can never go back.
A Labrador Retriever? We asked for a German Shepherd.
I knew going paperless would come back to haunt us!
I agree, now that the Earth integration experiment is over, Trump can take his true form. Now who's a good boy?
Can we keep him, Daddy? Can we?
This is not a dog's whirl.
Nice. Which part of Woof Woof sounds like Beam me up ?
Who’s Scotty?
Somehow I don't think he'll know why we only have 4 digits.
Whoa, I said Beam me up Scotty, not make me a Scotty
He wants a spray tan for our trip to Venus.
Who’s gonna beam up Scotty?
Space travel! My favorite thing!!
What happened to those plastic bags clipped to his collar?
I hope he's flying saucer trained.
Sorry Captain - we took low bid on the teleporter enhancements.
We can keep him, but you’ll have to take him on spacewalks every day.
Finally! A specimen that actually enjoys the anal probe.
Just stick to the Internet and you'll be fine.
Who's a good, not-fully-grown male specimen?
Timmy has fallen into the what?
I'm a Martian's best friend too.
“We believe it's the only species that could love Trump, unconditionally or otherwise
How did they explore space without opposable thumbs?
So this is man’s best friend, huh?
Second question, Woof, does your planet have thermonuclear weapons capability?
Qupg? Xanoogasit!
Maybe we should serve his leader too.
Why is doggone such a popular expression down there?
Are you sure you couldn't find a cow?
Alexa, I said “beam up Spock” not “beam up dog.”
What language does he speak
What's wrong with shithole country's?
Thank you for your advice, now we are ready to invade the Earth too.
With such short sentences, I'm not sure we can ever learn to speak the language.
This was the most intelligent species we could find.
Finding life on Canis Major is a minor miracle!
Yes, you can come along but if you soil the carpet, you're toast!
Hah! You didn't really think our leader was Donald Trump, did you?
Apparently, it's some kind of roulette game. He's the croupier and his name is Vladimir.
I’m only loyal to human weirdos.
nummers?
He was the only one down there not talking on his cell phone
We should eat him.
you're not a Scottie.
It seems to be saying "Take me to your feeder"?
Ok, but it's not made of cheese.
I can’t touch him I’m allergic. Well he certainly a lot smarter than any of those two legged creatures we’ve found.
We understand you're upset by the new California tax on dog biscuits, all solid matter, everything in Plato's Cave, and the ethers, but short of going with us all you can do is move to a low tax state like Texas or Florida.
Say ‘Beam me down’ Spotty!
She says she's man's best friend. What's a "man?" Look, it's God spelled backwards. \ It appears to be "God" spelled backwards.
Sorry, the boss said no immigrants.
I think that he needs to go for a walk!
This must be their leader.
I don't know how to tell you this, but I just had a look in our cupboard. Brace yourself.
I believe this ain't nothing but a hound dog.
He's the only one thats always happy to see us!
Dogdammit! It's a God!
Now he's my best friend
Westminster sent me.
Will you be our pilot?
Bowser wants to know who told us to Go Fetch?
He hears His Master’s Voice.
They are much hairier and smarter than they were last time we were here in the '50s
Our copilot has arrived
Fascinating...it appears to be using sign language!
Wow! I never thought RCA Victor was a real dog.
How about you just sniff it, instead?
zeep, borp, beep, Rusty! zignu, roror, woink, Rusty!
Who's a good alien?
This is the most intelligent species on this planet
Many humans see to think that they live on a diet of homework.
Now remember, no more chasing frisbees.
Yes! There is a mouse in my pocket.
They say our country is going to the dogs. We don't want it. Can you help?
He uses a curious snout-in-crotch method of communication.
Always look to wonder what is beyond. Aliens may be weird to us, but are we weird to them? Don't be afraid to explore. There is more than what meets the eye.
I was hoping it was a monkey, but Fido will do.
Who's a good doggie!
We just drag them around on leashes--unless you can get them off our backs.
Yeah...they walk behind me with a scoop. They pick it up and put in a bag and carry it home with them.
Beam me up Scotty! It's got to be better up there than it is down here!
Maybe we should take him on a f-l-o-a-t?
He is amazing, the democrats have made him sound robotic. All he says his sexism, racism, and xenophobia over and over again
He’s asking no who gave his owner a Vulcan Nerve Pinch.
Hey, I'm not going to space-walk him, you space-walk him!
They don't wear much clothing, do they?
How can you defend Humans as "dogs' best friend?" Please. Thank you.
This specimen is effective in making humans act like humans.
I thought it was better to cut out the middle man.
No, you can't go outside.
Take me to your follower.
Just a wild guess -is it Rumplestiltskin?
We hope you also become our best friend.
So, If we have intercourse with this earthling people will call us lazy and unproductive.
Is this their prized LAB specimen I asked you to beam up?
Tom-Tom, your Mission: Im-paws-sible
You must improve your aim with the earth beam.
We've seen your species with other creatures who pick up your poop so we naturally thought you must be the superior of the two.
Yes, far more intelligent than what we expected to encounter
I think he's smart and obedient too. Watch this: Wag!
Do we eat it or pet it---I'm not sure which.
Sirs, while I appreciate you clarifying your meaning telepathically, my response is the same: I cannot take you TO him. My leader is around my neck!
We're ready for your report, Chief Spy!
People say he is like a stable genius.
I mean, it's a cool costume, but this is the gathering of DOUG impersonators...
I really think our approach will work. But first we need to know what "treat" means.
This is the best they have to offer.
This one is way better than the last one named "Trump".
Remember; bark four times when you find the one the humans call E.T.
Finding Pluto not what I expected, but he is cute!
Fuck. I wanted pussy but I got this instead.
You will be our Earth Rover, so sniff around and report back.
And you thought it was a good idea to let your teenager try to fix the transporter.
Those window things come down eventually, right?
Is it woof woof? Ruff ruff? Arf arf? Or bow wow?
How did you train the humans to dispose of your solid waste?
So... Where do our probes go?
This must be what they call an 'Air Bud.'
Air Bud?
I brought you three here because you're the smarest of your race.
Somtimes I have dreams about being a golden retriever in a upper-class white family
He seemed to be the most intelligent creature on the planet.
This will be a historic moment. One pf you will take me on my first Space Walk
The dog can choose to walk on the planet or merely them send them a package.
These humans who have enslaved you employ something called a toilet?
Interesting shapeshift.
He's their higher form of intelligence
No. No. Best friend, not best man
You promised me a beagle like Snoopy!
Now you say, “He’s a good boy.”
Yes, Be Happy, “You’ve got a Friend”.
Grr, ruff, bow wow, grrr?
Klaatu Bow-Wow Nikto.
She followed me back. Can we keep her?
Oh, here we go. He's going to ask us how old we are in dog's years.
Sit Donald, siiiiit.....!
Finicky transporter. Ain't that a bitch.
Aw, can we keep him?
Who wants to be the first to touch his parts?
Do you mind lathering the Burt's Bee's before applying this time??
Scotty really is becoming a more popular name for pets.
It’s simply taking longer to get the information you requested
I have second thoughts about traveling all this way from Dyslexia.
That's a what a human looks like?
He's with us on a pro bono basis.
It went somewhere in the bushes back Sirus X.
Well! Woof, woof, waggle waggle, sure beats texting!
This earthling is very friendly, but it poops and pees all over the place.
The language scientists believe this creature is saying, ‘has anyone seen my tennis ball?’. Now, what is tennis ball?
How do we take it for a walk...
He’s Bowie’s.
He must be their leader. People are always following him, dragged by a leash.
Maybe he's just happy to see us.
What a coincidence, we're from the dog star too!
He's pitching his tell-all memoir!
Does somebody want to go somewhere leash laws are unknown?
Judging from their planet, and other planets in their vicinity, they don't clean up after themselves, how do you get them to clean up your poop?
Apparently we do have a dog in this hunt.
I guess when we instructed the transporter to send up the best of earth's civilization, we should have been more specific.
Yay, it worked this time! Greta idea to test this on that weird creature he was with first.
We HAVE TO stop meeting like this.
WELL THE BIPEDS SEEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH AN ORIFICE AT THE FRONT AND SECURE THIS QUADRUPEDS WASTE FROM AN ORIFICE AT ITS REAR, SO WHO KNOWS?
Who's turn is it to take Laika out for a walk?
Hold on, fella. Let me grab a leash, and I'll take you for a moon walk.
We've learned to control this Earthling's stinger by alternating the sounds, good boy...bath...good boy...bath.
Why do they insist on calling me Scotty? And what does beam me up even mean?" All this for a bone.
I'm going to call her 'Oumuamua. You're the _real_ scout, 'Oumuamua. Yes you are! Yes you are!
Here's what we know: alert eyes,loud noises, constant motion and lovable.
He's supposed to be their Dog.
Can't we get a ship's cat like every other UFO?
Who rescued who?
So tell us, what's the deal with Poodles?
Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
Are you sure that's a farmer from Idaho?
It's a new thing called house arrest.
We usually just take away a femur.
... and he won't share any of the hamburgers with you?
Don't we need some pee pads?
It seems to serve the will of a much more powerful 'Master.'
But we checked him out on the internet...
It's alien to think this could be your best friend.
Anyone see where the tennis ball floated?
We found him their Internet.
He said that on earth the people who do all the work look like us. He would like us to prepare his food.
We expected intelligent life here, but not smarter than us.
I took him out this morning.
This galaxy has gone to the dogs.
Take us to your humanoid companion.
He pursued us rather doggedly.
Star Paws: The Empire Strokes Back
He reports that if we can eliminate cats, we can control the planet within a week.
Another stray?
I never thought they would look so much like a "Dog"
Thank you for your visit, we feel privileged to have met you, I'm sorry we had no common language. We must go back to that distant light in the sky we showed you. Ciao.
Polly wanna cracker?
Who's going to walk the dog?
Oh wise one, how have you trained the human to scoop every time you poop?
Well, since his license has expired, we must send him back.
What the hell?
Let's name him Rover.
I am my master's voice. F.ck off!
I said bring a Good Ol' Boy, not a Good Boy.
This should help with our cow herding problems.
The scanner says he’s a good boy.
Whose going to take him for walks?
You're from the Dog Star! Are you Sirius??
Who pressed the blue button?
I told my husband I was going on a girls trip. That sent him packing.
After beaming him up, it'd be stupid to tell him to 'stay', right?
Earthlings need a space walk to reduce cargo...how quaint...
Do you wanna go for a space walk? Do you, boy? Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
He says his father’s name is Laika.
C'mon Tom tell me, did you sense any commonsense on earth yet ?
I was chasing a bird,
We can't be too careful - zap him with the defleazinator!
Who's a good qizibork? You're a good qizibork.
You’re coming with us as the representative to the Earth’s doomsday judgement.
I hope he’s hypoallergenic
I know he needs to go, but where will we find a fire hydrant?
It smells like updog in here.
Let's name it "Shithole".
I told you that this flight was going to the dogs.
Trump seems more intelligent than what we thought.
What’s a well?
His tag says Elon, but I think he's more of a Max.
We said 'Scotty' not 'A Scotty'.
If this is man’s best friend, this should be easy.
Welcome to the Starship Dyslexia.
We asked the survey team to bring back the most intelligent creature they could find on Earth
of course I speak 6())*3$>"]
I don’t think we are supposed to eat it.
Aw, this one's even cuter!
We finally have the resources for toupees.
Yeah, it's crazy. They still haven't found out who the good boy is.
I think he understands our command structure.
I thought you said "God." This thing is pretty much the opposite.
The perfect extraterrestrial that barks less, wags more.
we want that thing that is wagging behind you now.
I didn't much care for his last batch of brownies.
No, I said roll over
According to our research, it's called a 'pupper.' Humans say that they do not deserve them for reasons that remain unclear.
Who's a good boy? Rex is a good boy!
Your rescue dino has latched onto me.
He is scruffy-looking, but can he herd nerfs?
I'll take care of it if you let us keep it.
His tail is wagging. Let's probe him to see why.
Try to beam up some puppy pad...It's a long trip home
What do you mean 'I have to call him, Sir'?
We agreed that a tattoo wouldn't express commitment in quite the same way.
And they have these urinal things, that is why nothing is marked.
Who's a good boy?
Seems cleaner and friendlier than the humans we've beamed up, so lets keep him as our best friend and eject the humans.
Fetch!
As good a leader as any I've seen.
Yes, but can it roll over?
Let's ask her about the tail wagging the martian.
What does it mean, “He sin’t nothin’ but a moondog?”
Remember don't speak, they think your a pet and they are smarter. They still don't get it. Oh yeah and they will clean your waste up too.
They're smarter than I thought.
I definitely beamed up the one who is more evolved. The other being just kept collecting his poop.
I think it's a Land Rover
Earthling, what's the most popular collar on Rodeo Drive?
Tell us about your best friend
“Hotdog”, we finally got one.
Given their television signals, humans are more complex than we thought.
When you get there, find out what that 'Pluto' nonsense was all about.
You’re supposed to give me a piece of bacon now.
Our probe clearly observed them harvesting your excrement, and yet you are not their Leader?
I asked the standard question, "Who do you answer to?" The guy pointed at this thing.
I...told you...if we came back to the beginning of the world, dogs would be first!
I know nothing!
Why is this earthling naked save for the collar?
My name is Fido, not Scotty.
The Earthling is Furbaby Fetch 1
The guide didn't say humans had such big noses!
Daddy's widdle baby want a treat?
What went wrong? I was aiming to beam of his master.
He keeps asking for something called - Bacon-Bacon-Bacon!
No, we have not seen a dog named Laika.
If your trying to alienate me you've suceeded
He is obviously their leader; they have to follow him around on a tether and retrieve his droppings in little bags.
Which one of you is Napoleon>
spacewalkies?
Hey wait a second, you're not a Scottie. Beam him up, Paul.
He's a good boy, but next time I'm getting a breed that doesn't need so much space.
What do you mean, he picks up your poop too?
Where's my breakfast?
We kindly ask that you refrain from barking during the embarkation process.
I believe the inhabitants of this planet call this a "lobster," and they are reputed to be delicious.
They say he won the popular vote
He must be from the future.
You idiot. This isn't the G-O-D Planet.
Wow, earthlings are very intelligent!
We understand that he said that he is the ruler of the Earth.
Scottie is playing tricks again!
Useless. Let's move on to a different planet.
I don’t care if it does feel strange -we’re landing now. just go out there and throw them a bone.
How old is she in Jupiter-orbit dog-years?
Did anyone remember the pooper scooper?
This time it will work. Goodbye, Laika 347-B!
A canine cosmonaut ? Interesting.
Looks like one of you guys will have to drain the swamp.
I think he said, "Hurry, I need to go outside."
Guard, it's your turn, don't forget the poop bag.
All I did was open a cheese wrapper and it molecularized!
And he doesn't shed!
Woof, woof, bark bark, wolf bark, bark woof, sit!
he said it's no longer a dog's world
Don't slobber until you've safely reached the planetary surface.
Sorry, you'll have to stay on-board. We just heard the President doesn't have a pet.
'I bet his flift is worse than his bite"
This is their leader?
Phil, what did we say about those late night TV commercials?
Your industry can burn. I will approach you professionally, as I do every activity, but how dare you? You tiny souls. You malignant professionals. How dare you treat anyone this way. You'll hear from me. Goddamn you.
I have heard these creatures are good stress relievers!
fruball druball draguball nuball?
Bring us 2 soy lattes, a cappuccino, 2 bran muffins and your best friend.
I've always wondered if anyone understood me.
Who knew earthlings were so woodgie?!
"Jrkvr lrtrp 'sit' frng." Ktrwm!
Just wait, humankind worked very hard to get their feces, it must worth it.
He says his mother, Laika, told him about us.
That's a good boy!
This is the leader of Sirius? Seriously?
"If you still want to be our best friend you will do it"!!!
Interesting, first dog in space, what's are next step?
I had my appendix removed to rescue this?
I did program in honest "Candidate"
You spent your points on this?!
Please tell us how you integrated your anal probe into your proboscis!
''IS MAN HIS BEST FRIEND'' ?
"The tag says 'TRUMP'".
Fine, we can keep him... just make sure he doesn't pee on the hyperdrive
Makes the two footers walk, feed and make nice to them, obviously he most advanced
He must be the leader, the other creatures pick up his poop
Go fetch, Scotty!
It seems pleasant, but I'm not sure it's worth a probe.
Knick Knack? Paddy Whack? Give the dog a bone.
We already have enough human samples to bring back
Just because the nametag reads "Donald" doesn't mean that it's "the" Donald.
What a good stable genius....yes.....that's a good stable genius!
Let's beam up another specimen. This one doesn't talk.
The Universal Translator says his bark is worse than his bite.
Yes, that's Uranus and no, you can't go sniff it!
Wooolfff?
I believe they prefer "little dog."
The dowsing tail never fails. Drain him!
The human species have gone to the dogs.
Tell mission control we've discovered a new Instagram star.
Woof? Qu'est-ce que c'est "woof?"
!esrevinU eth fo reluR emocleW
That's funny, I thought there'd be a scotty up here.
We can't procreate with that!
Time to fucc n succ, am I right bois?
That's not Spock
Scotty, WTF!
I already have a best friend.
Oh he's so cute!
Walkies are going to be a big problem...
I think he said "Take me to your pee-er".
Mr President, you look nothing like what we see on your messages from your planet.
I knew we'd find intelligent life on earth. Glad we kept looking !!!
My parole officer is sensitive to social stigma, so he lobbied hard to get me the slim model.
No. We deal only with those who have evolved the furthest.
Don't look him in the eye or you'll lose an arm.
I cant explain it! He just came down from planet Earth.
we cannot make head or tail why earthlings find it attractive
What's that, Lah-si? You say Tee-Mee's trapped in a quantum flux well?
There was a dish. Where's the dish?
You have the opportunity to be an alien's best friend, so which of us would you like to go space walkies with?
The universe is depending on you. Whatever you do -- please -- do not take a crap on any rugs you may encounter.
"Bring me to your master?" Could you not come up something more original
The language down on Earth must be "ruff!!!"
It appears the probe comes pre-loaded with this biologic unit of soft-ware.
Not again Zordack! Get me the Spot remover.
Now float. Float!
Did anyone remember to transport a Pooper Scooper?
Who's a good alien?
great. now space rover, give me paw.
Planet Fido?
Here you tie dogs with sausage?
My dogged persistence has propelled me all the way to the top.
We want to know how you get the Earthlings to obey.
Man’s best friend.
They say weekly, you say daily—we shall explore Hump Day further.
Beam me up, Scottie Dog.
Uh oh, he looks like he wants to go outside again.
Is this their leader?" "I sure hope so!
Dinner time!
Don’t put me on the spot!
Oops. Looks like we strayed into Canis Minor.
That's not Seth Meyers!
That's not my dog.
How does sandpaper feel?
Three Log Night
I think we signed up for the wrong universe exchange program.
By the time we return he'll be a puppy.
I am SO happy that UberEATS has finally expanded their delivery area!
Something is wrong….this specimen does not fit any descriptions we were given of planet earth's dominant species scheduled for peaceful replacement.
Who’s a good boy - you are!
Yes, but who is going to walk him?
I'm pretty sure 'Woof' is a code word. Now we just have to figure out what it means.
I believe I said Beam me up Scottie; not Labrador Retrievers.
Well I wasn't expecting this when I followed the light.
So George, what do you think it is?
He's such a good boy... so let's consider that before we incinerate his planet.
He says he's only a dog there.
I am done with the short leash
Is it the tail or the nose that gives us direction?
Maybe it,s a four footed friendly human?
Let's train all earth dogs to turn around three times before lying down.
Surely, you can help us get on their 'good' side.
Beam me up Scotty - now!
Timmy fell into a black hole! Run, get help!
Could this be The Scotty?
Ok, who hacked my Amazon Prime account?
Scotty wants to visit his friends in Dog Heaven so he is waiting to be beamed up.
Er, Nelson -- I thought you ordered a pizza?
One more time, how do you get the human to clean-up your poop?
Let's exempt him from giving us his paw as well.
It’s temporary until he learns to follow orders
His obedience trainer says his behavior will evolve over time.
There may be little proof of intelligence on planet Earth, but there can be no doubt there is evidence of great love.
Here, UFidO, here boy!
black mirror season 5
I said, "Beam me UP!" Not "Beam me PUP!"
I can't decide whether we should eat him or probe his brain!
No need to get hot under the collar George, their bark really is worse than their bite
Terrific, we’ve snagged alpha canis majoris.
His dog tag says, "If found, beam me up Scotty."
It's as if he has something inside to release. One of us better take him outside.
Take me to your master! Arf-arf!
Sorry Kirk! Operator error.
Nimotz, it’s a basic sign language using his tail. He says he wants to go out.
I hope this one is more intelligent than the last one.
There must be some kind of mistake. I’m still waiting on my DNA results from Ancestry.com.
Now be a good boy and go fetch their leader!
Spaceman #2, do you believe Connery is The One True Bond or have you been compromised by the mysterious orbit of your origin?
and we just ran out of probes - we'll have to use our fingers!
He's trained to smell Uranus light years away.
She seemed the only one worth saving from that pit of excrement.
Where’s your gentle leader?
Nice car. Shotgun!
He says he wants to sniff our butts.
Don't worry. This diplomat will deliver.
What kind of cat is that?
Finally, we have their leader.
Ubu?
We must presume these are the masters. All other species tolerate their public defecation.
We found it far superior to the upright, two-legged creatures on the orb.
Earthlings are much more well behaved than what our 'fake news' reports would tell us.
Not to worry. We'll beam you up Scotty.
I took him along because he gave the secret password, Woof!
He's not talking. Let's rough him up.
...Let’s deport him back to earth...he’ll want to chain emigrate every cur down there...
* dog barks loudly * Send him back to Earth!
airbnb advertised a meaty-or?
Gentlemen, this is step 1 in how to make a dog star.
his speech patterns are off the chain; this is going to take a while
Just beam him out before he eats your left arm too!
We never should have sent the dyslexic recruit to investigate their deity.
Hi. Take me to your breeder.
We have traveled from a galaxy far far away... please help us to understand these so-called 'dog years.'
Now I understand how someone like Trump could be elected.
Are you sure this is the intelligent life we were expecting?
Dog: "They kidnapped me because they need a best friend"
Can I get to the pet store from here?
Where is the orange vest? Without one, our fees will be astronomical.
Fido, you’ll have to hold ‘til the meteor storm passes.
I wish I could probe myself.
Apparently in cities it's processed food is very collectable!
Back up. He has space issues.
That is very observant of you - we do all look the same up here.
First one to bark, would be the first one to disembark!
He seems excited about our anti-cat pro stick agenda.
Pardons for our ignorance, your excellency; but how do we spin "Woof" into a movement for the masses?
We actually took him awa from his lead, er....
Don't hurt him, Xyfor. Any friend of theirs is a friend of ours.
Yes, it's exactly like "The Last Starfighter" but with burying bones!
We requested Earth’s most magnificent Cure-all.
I think he liked the ancient newspaper better.
Can we keep him?....he's hypoallergenic.
Why didn't we get a poodle? Now I'm feeling allergic.
Did he say roof or ruff ?
Three against one?
We lost the human attached to it.
Which of you would like the privilege of picking up after me?
This one is looking "ruff".
So, Zork, did you learn anything else on Earth except how to fetch?
I AM G.O.D.!!!!
Speak, Buddy, Speak!
We specifically requested a Beagle.
where's the leash?
Dogs are gods on Sunaru.
I thought we were getting McConaughey, Bullock or Damon.
He says he's from Planet "Arf".
The earth boy called it "Astro" just before assimilation.
I doubt he's intergalactic trained.
We only use Bitecoin! Why won’t you believe me?
Beam me up, Scottie Dog.
Beam him up and out.
Fantastic ! Now we can determine what's in this creature's waste.
Don't forget the pooper scooper.
It always happens during vacations
God speed to our best friend!
If I'm being honest, I would say we're more man's *good* friend than than best friend.
Looks like it's gonna' be a three Martian night.
I am your anointed leader
Knick-Knack-Paddy-Whack-Give-A-Dog-A-Phone-Home
Any of you guys interested in some 'Victrola' stock, cheap?
His chew toy rolled under the couch.
The creature escaped from a building that read SPCA - I was looking for help with our spacecraft and thought it could help us.
Yeah, but my neck has never felt better.
Well of course we can beam you back down to Pluto! Just be careful whom you wag to.
It’s not Uranus I’m thinking about. It’s his.
Can we probe him?
A nagging innovation. They call it cave-arrest.
I'm under house arrest
Maybe we should do the probe again.
Think of the big leap for doggy-kind.
Albuquerque! I said, do you know the way to Albuquerque!
Dogonit!
The life entities of this planet seem friendly enough - his companion with the MAGA hat tried to lick me too!
This will definitely be the farthest I've ever seen him fetch.
They say he is man's best friend on Earth.
Yet another service dog.
Finally, an alien who understands me!
How does it text.
I'm under house pet arrest.
Soon, he’ll be eating out of our hands.
Not at all like the Greys we imagined.
whose turn is it to walk the dog...
If we can learn how he did it... then we won’t ever need our female species again!”
He's a little anxious whenever we have company.
'Tis a dog's tail, signifying nothing--and everything.
Good boy -- now go fetch.
Scotty, is that you?
It was all in your timing. You said "Beam me up Scotty."
He is more intelligent than that orange haired oaf they tried to push on us.
"Fly back to Area 51, for an epic 'good boy fetch!'
He just wants to go outside and pee!
So who forgot to call the teleporter repair guy?
Think he's a good boy?
Take me back home or I will piss and poop all over this place.
Should we take him back to our planet or leave him here in Alabama?
Who is your best friend?
Well, it wasn’t our first choice but it keeps its rear discharge port very clean and our probe won’t need decontamination.
I understand that Canines communicate by tail movement.
Woah! It is telling me with telepathic powers that there are these weird things on Earth called... Hoomins?
It’s hard to know where to start.
Well, we beamed him up, but he's not a Scottie!
What hath dog wrought
What would Krypto do?
I've read about similar Earth creatures. This then must be a rattle dog.
uh.. oh.. Chickie was in the beam with Rudy
I'm betting if we had sent a dog to the moon 50 years ago, would we'd have many close Extraterrestrial friends by now? Who knows, maybe they'd even sit up and roll over for us!
You said it was only on the top of their heads.
Everybody be careful; it may be a man's best friend, but we're not sure what it thinks about aliens.
I swear he threw it
It's called a human being
Glorgg, I told you Earthlings won’t just look like us with shorter faces! You have no imagination.
Pretty please can we keep him?
Teach us your most beguiling tricks
When I asked your to bring up a rover I thought it would be suitable for the moon. This model is always looking for trees.
bro look at this fuckin dog lmao
Call Gort, he speaks dog.
But you claimed you were a scientist on the Internet.
Either our transport signal is off by a few meters, or XYBLX transformed into a squirrel chasing monster...
Those humans down there are total idiots, and that feline thing kept scratching holes in our spacesuits, but now I think we are on to something...
I translate his tail language as "Take me to your Leader".
Ain't that a bitch?--We won't know till it stands up!
He thinks he is going for a walk.
It's your turn to let him out this time.
I thought his crap circles were messages!
Yes I'm sure I want to do a brain swap with this dumbass dog. My alien body sucks I wanna be a dog.
I said from the parking lot, not barking lot!
We've selected you because you're a very good girl.
Beam me up Scooby.
Go for a walk?
A perfect specimen of a mormon female.
Is he Zorgon-trained?
I said apple, not ALPO!
Agent Scruffy, what are you anal probe findings?
It has plenty of hair we can harvest for three toupees.
I thought you said it would salivate.
Who's a good blorphmablop?
We asked for a representative who is compassionate, loving, non-judgmental, accepting of our unusual appearance and willing to listen to what we have to say.
Bring me to your litter.
Ruh-roh, they are sending you to the White House.
Okay, I didn't resign. I was impeached.
I said “up Scotty” not “a Scottie.”
We see that you’re a leaker.
As the most intelligent life form, we're taking you home with us.
Ah, I have three pets and a nice space view- now all I need is that new jacuzzi.
Siriusly? This is day #1271 and you still don't know we can't take you out to play fetch?
Bruh this is the fatass that's been eating all them Tide pods we needed
Don’t look at me for an explanation. He didn’t beam up with us.
Apologies Earthling.....you are not one..... and what is a frisbee?
It's the most advanced species we've found on Earth: wordless communication and a warless society.
Space Dogs, 2010: but one of them died
I think you may have invented alligator clamps
How did these humans build a civilization without opposable thumbs??
Just remember kids, you promised to walk him.
As you can see, you have made a terrible mistake. I am not a Scottie.
...and so the USS Enterprise eventually became designated Air Force One...
Stop staring and start petting.
So far we know that arf-arf-woof is a command for a lesser being to gather up poop.
I found myself and my next startup idea!
Here Snoop! Here Snoop!
Rut row
No, I don’t know Seth McFarland!
Eh, Greetings from Earth?
Foiled, woof, again!
I said take us to your leader but he said we probably wouldn't be allowed in.
So this is the supposed “Intelligent Species”?!
Can you get Lincoln up here too?
He doesn't appear to be afraid or anxious. He does seem to be communicating a desire to go 'out', whatever that means.
The dogspotting mods will yell at me for posting this.
If we name it, we'll have to keep it.
Dog wags tail, that's much better. Beam it down.
"How long did it take you yo rule the planet EARTH"?
He says his name is Bow Wow and he comes from the planet Arf.
Essentially, I'm the one you know as "Little Timmy." But you have the gist of the story, Yes.
That tan is developing quite nicely along his snout.
I think we should call him Sci-Fido! I think we should call him Sci-Fido!
Dog is my co-pilot.
KZTR TSBN JLCI FIDO
I guess my theory about intelligent life forms on earth was wrong!
I think she wants to go for a spacewalk.
My daughter wanted a cat but how can you resist that face
I am lookin’ for the nearest tree.
It was supposed to be a Scotty.
Sorry Ug, maybe another night. I’m under cave arrest.
Very puzzling. Judging by our radio intercepts, we thought the earth creatures could communicate quite well.
That's not Scotty.
What’s his name? Beamer
I can teach you how to domesticate them.
Sit, good boy! You are know traveling in space with creatures from another planet. If you wish to return to earth, you must bark 3 times.
We found him walking ahead of a 2-legged creature he was pulling along and it was clear he was the more intelligent life form.
Our bad. Give us back our arms and we'll go peacefully.
Your Time Is Up.
Come to our planet! That's the most artistic series of woofs I've ever heard!
A Pointer, not a Scottie?
Weird-it sounds like they just keep saying "We come in Threes"
Abdogted - take me to your fleader
It seems a little too excited about taking us to its master.
A bit to tuff and chewy for my taste. You can have the rest.
I wish it was this easy to sniff out a human target for probing.
Everything we need to know about humans we can learn from dogs. And dogs are safer and self cleaning.
You fella's can't tell the difference between a dog and a human...?
Does It Bite ?
I said "beam me up a scottie" and this is what turned up!
What? Up dawg!
It's going to be a doggone shame.
Teleport his waste to that bean counter who denied us the litterbox.
This being is highly evolved. It exists only for food, sleep, and play.
All I said was beam me up Spottie!
It won't work. He's the wrong breed.
I'm gonna call him Alpha.
Alien: how did you survive the vacuum of space? Dog: wait the what now
So this is where they really sent ol’ yeller
Remember , tell them you're a service dog - they'll let you go wherever you want.
Perhaps we've finally found that higher intelligence we've been searching for.
Ugly thing, isn't he?
Okay, so who is going to be first to walk him?
Are you sure it said "god" on his bowl, Dislexia?
Now Beam Me Up Now!!
Who’s the good carbon-based lifeform?
We transported you here because we heard you were top dog and head of the Flea World.
Okay, we get it, the trip here was rough...
He seems friendly but I prefer cats.
Well, he does go by the name "Elvis."
Did you have a good float, Spot?
I think I'm more of byorkle person.
Sorry, Zircon, in this disguise you'll have to lick the humans.
WELCOME ABOARD! IF YOU MUST, FIRE HYDRANT STRAIGHT AHEAD!
Look Laika collusion
We would like you to be our intergalactic ambassador.
Sure, you can be E.T.'s pet dog!
Nobody's going to believe they are your oversized dolls you sell.. Anyway how are you going to get that in the overhead?
They've pretty much conquered how to feed us but getting them to scoop up the waste is a work in progress.
We understand this is the leader we are seeking.
Can we teach him to speak?
You beamed me up, but I’m not a Scotty!
That's not Kirk!
Become there best friend
Looks like we need to work more on his fetching skills.
Nope, no others left. He played dead.
A great distraction! Hopefully THIS dog won't end up liking the aliens more.
Abduction is no problem, but how do you get them to clean up after you?
So, how did you get your slaves to wait on you, and take care of your every need?
Another Entanglement 2.10 screw-up. We beamed up Scotty to fix the warp drive but we got this Labrador going "Woof!"
The Russians of earth-year 1957 are more furry than we anticipated.
fetched home after a long ride!
Hey guys, looks like you’re having a ruff night.
Check your translator, Quark. Clearly "Take me to your beagle" doesn't work.
Time to go home, girl. It turns out retrievers aren’t a good fit in space.
So we are namesakes then.
Meanwhile on earth: thank god they picked good old Bodo as example for earthlings!
Who's a good inter-gallactic genetically engineered gender-unspecific canid?!
Oh My God! We need to repair this dyslexic transporter!
Now we can go home.
I gotta lay off the cat poo.
He doesn't look like Lassie.
We only have people food.
I said, 'Beam me up a scotty,' not a golden retriever.
Do you play soccer?
This one seems more intelligent than that one they call "trump."
He says, even after centuries of study he has still not found intelligent life on earth.
I hope they use a leash when they let me out to pee.
Finally...an intelligent life form!
Didn't we say "please beam me up a Dalmation?"
So, your saying that "any shithole will do"?
wHo DIs nEw HoOe
FIU4QY089RFJKDVKLJ. Arf arf.
..yes:..we boys are made of snips and snails and puppy dog tails
When are you going to walk me already?
Ok, who has the stick co-ordinates?
I'm sure his 7&tz1 is worse than his ++92%!
I prefer Spin the Bottle.
Why do you keep asking if we brought the ball?
He just did an ass drag..
I'm putting 3,000 zorbecks on 25 red.
I told you this was going to be a problem....
Humans have evolved, Sir, since our missions here in the ’50s.
And do try to beam me to a shithole.
...and we’ll try to beam you to a shithole.
And we have to take him out twice a day!
That's not my luggage.
He truly enjoys the view through the window!
It's some cereal. It's supposed to be good for ya.
I wonder if he realizes "neutered" means the same thing on our planet?
As I recall, Snrgll, you ate the sex organs of our last visitor, so I think it's someone else's turn.
Welcome to planet dyslexia, god!
Oh I know..... LET'S NAME IT.... SHITHOLE it does that a lot........!
I think he needs some space!
I am surrounded by aliens
For an alien life form, he looks a little rough!
I've heard of absurd, but this is ridiculous!
Take us to your Cesar.
We told you to fetch your leader.
You forgot to beam up Dorothy.
This world accepts a master more readily than expected.
We must learn why it chases saucers.
Her leader called her a bitch but I could see she was the superior species.
Perhaps we should have been more specific regarding “who’s” leader.
You said you needed a new co-pilot.
better not abscond him...four legged humans would never get past security.
This time his get up and go is too far-fetched.
Beam him back Scotty!
He does his business in another dimension. It saves on baggies.
Will you tell us if we give you a glorp?
I think his name is Woof. "Bow wow" means "hello".
He looks friendly, but does he come from a s***hole planet?
Why do we even bother with the Rover? We just back sticks.
AND WE HAVE DOG FOOD IN THE SHAPE OF A BONE. DO YOU HAVE THAT UP THERE?
Wanat Reeet?
I'm sorry, it's the Scotty's day off.
Remember all safety procedures when debarking, and try not to be catty with the humans.
Wonder what they thought of him down there?
Scotty, not Spotty!
Wanna go for a ride?
Yes we're going for a ride...no you can't stick your head out the window.
Mission accomplished. I've abducted the smartest occupant of the White House.
When does it poop?
I asked for a guinea pig.
Play dead, Scotty.
Hummmm, Hashtag says he's man's best friend
I wish he'd stop following me to work.
We beamed you up, Scotty. Very enterprising of us, don't you think?
Your turn to walk him, Stan.
Beam me up, Labrador. No! Beam me up Schnauzer! Beam me up Yorkie?...
Boy, are you going to bow-wow them when you get there!
We've been watching you for a long time. Is it 'bow wow' or 'arf arf'?
But is it hot?
They did say our new captain was the Top Dog. I thought he'd be taller...
I didn’t abduct my dog, he abducted me.
glerba sherb galäquu gOrbb! :•)
It's a new breed of space tourist.
Who's turn is it to walk Rover?
what's a wee-wee pad?
We brought you here to pitch a movie concept -- The Flea!
Should we probe its trump?
They just added this new species to our Anal Probing Research List.....and such a cute face! Hmmm, anybody want to volunteer ?
Isn't "bow-wow" the same in any language?
Told you he wasn't their leader.
It’s the latest thing for times when you can’t get out to walk your dog......
Looks a bit like a Fetchem.
How do you milk this thing?
He obeyed our first command, but will he speak?
I come in peace to powwow,wow!
Are you sure its set to 350•?
He never tells them, but I really want to know who the good boy is.
Oh look Sam! Your wife is back.
Are you sure this is the right one? I thought that the earth creatures were more intelligent than that
It's Stephen Hawking!
Hurry, someone get some newspaper!
Ol’ Scotty here is just beaming!
I thought we were getting a Scotty to beam us up.
So is this what the humans call a 'pupper' or a 'doggo'?
What is a comfort dog?
I think we shall call him Steve
Alien speaking “they really clean up your poop!
What exactly is 'a dog's life' ?
Let’s see how far he can fetch.
Look, what could wrong? All you have to do is find a human, put a leash on him and beam back up!
The rotting garbage scented bait draws a small but faithful audience.
What? I don’t get it. Is it the fur?
You say this is the most intelligent life you found?
